      "title": "eIP 62 Euler V2 “Capture The Flag” Competition",
      "content": "*Author* — Erik Arfvidson, Head of Security @ Euler Labs\n\n## Abstract\nThis proposal requests approval to create an ETH + USDC + wstETH vault with 575 ETH and 2m USDC using funds from the Euler DAO treasury in order to run a “Capture The Flag” security competition prior to the public launch of Euler V2.\n\nPost-competition, these funds will either seed the first Euler vaults or reward successful security researchers, depending on the outcome.\n\n## Motivation\n**Enhanced Security and Reliability** — The cornerstone of this proposal is a rigorous “capture the flag” security competition, organised in partnership with a respected security provider. This competition will serve multiple critical purposes:\n\n*Final Stress Test*: By deploying a substantial sum from the Euler DAO treasury, we create an environment that closely mimics real-world conditions. This will attract top-tier security researchers and ethical hackers, ensuring a thorough examination of Euler V2’s codebase.\n\n*Vulnerability Discovery*: The competition format encourages a diverse range of approaches to probing the system. This increases the likelihood of uncovering subtle or complex vulnerabilities that might not be apparent in traditional audit processes.\n\n*Pre-Launch Assurance*: Conducting this intensive security assessment immediately prior to the public launch of Euler V2 provides a final layer of confidence in the protocol’s robustness. Any issues identified can be addressed before the full deployment, significantly reducing the risk of post-launch vulnerabilities.\n\n**Dual-Purpose Fund Utilisation** — The funds allocated for this proposal serve a dual purpose, maximising the value derived from this investment:\n\n*Initial Use*: During the competition, these funds act as the “flag” in the Capture The Flag competition, providing a tangible and significant incentive for participants to thoroughly test the system.\n\n*Post-Competition Allocation*: In the event that a security researcher successfully exploits the system, these funds serve as a substantial bug bounty. This ensures that even in a scenario where vulnerabilities are found, the investment directly contributes to improving the protocol’s security. If no vulnerabilities are found, these funds will be seamlessly transitioned into one of the first Euler vaults. This not only demonstrates confidence in the system but also provides immediate liquidity and utility for Euler V2 upon public launch.\n\n**Comprehensive Euler V2 Ecosystem Configuration** — A significant portion of the requested funds will be allocated to the meticulous setup and configuration of the Euler V2 ecosystem. This includes:\n\n*Ethereum Vault Connector (“EVC”)*: The EVC is a foundational layer designed to facilitate the core functionality required for a lending market.\n\n*Euler Vault Kit (“EVK”)*: The EVK is a system designed to streamline the process of creating and managing credit vaults within Euler V2. Careful development and testing of the EVK will enhance user experience and encourage adoption among both individual users and institutional partners.\n\n*Price Oracle Implementation*: Accurate and tamper-resistant price feeds are crucial for the stability and fairness of any DeFi protocol. We will implement and test a range of price oracles to ensure resilience and accuracy across various market conditions.\n\nBy allocating the requested funds across these critical areas, we ensure that Euler V2 launches as a secure, well-tested, and user-friendly protocol. This comprehensive approach not only minimises risks but also positions Euler V2 for rapid adoption and long-term success in the competitive DeFi landscape.\n\n## Specification\nTransfer 575 ETH and 2m USDC to the multisig wallet managed by the Euler Foundation, which will be deployed into a range of initial vaults on Euler V2.\n\n#### Risks and Considerations\n- The Euler community is well aware that smart contract risk exists with any allocation of this nature. This risk is mitigated by extensive audits that have taken place.\n- The robust market and liquidation frameworks established for the protocol aim to effectively manage and minimise any financial risks.\n\n#### Next Steps\nIf this proposal passes, Euler Labs will coordinate with the Euler Foundation in order to deploy funds in alignment with the specifications outlined in this proposal.",

      "content": "Title: [eIP61: Updated liquidity parameters]\nAuthor(s): @river0x\nSubmission Date: June 6 2025\nAbstract\n\nThis proposal suggests updating the Euler DAO’s liquidity provision in eiP58 1\nMotivation\n\nTaken from a comment on eIP58:\n\nI want to refresh eIP58 as it doesn’t really seem to have made a difference. Liquidity is poor due to the generalized nature of the position. The refresh involves a small revision from our current configuration. Instead of the liquidity being full range, we should provide it at 50% down and 200% up. Tighter liquidity in a fixed range would reduce the inefficiency currently experienced.\n\nIf the price falls to 2021 prices and no DAO member will be upset that there’s no liquidity to buy. If the price goes above 200% from here, we can rely on a buy wall around a $300M FDV. Once again any member of the DAO would likely be pleased with this outcome. This buy wall will enable many new entrants to reliably gain voting power in the DAO, creating new contributors.\n\nGiven feedback from others it feels appropriate to have a distinct discussion on this topic as opposed to joining it with other IPs.\n\nThere is still sufficient time to get this done before the protocol launches though as we want to facilitate governance token distribution - something current LP configuration (and subsequent market conditions) does not enable. To time the launch with simultaneously appropriate liquidity would be optimal.\n\nI am aware that this eIP61 is precisely what I outlined I did not want to happen in eIP58. This is not lost on me.\nSpecification\n\n    Withdraw the current full range liquidity.\n    Move the full liquidity provision to 50% down and 200% from current price.\n\nVoting\n\nOption 1 = Move the liquidity to $500K at 50% down and 200% up\n\nOption 2 = Keep $500K at full range",

      "title": "eIP 59: Contract for Services with Euler Labs",
      "content": "# Contract for Services with Euler Labs\n\n**Author(s):** Euler Labs\n**Submission Date:** 07 Mar '24\n\n## Abstract\nThe proposal requests a new contract for services for Euler Labs with an effective start date of 1 April 2024. Protocol security is a critical part of the services related to the proposal and represents the largest relative and absolute increase by comparison to the soon-to-expire previous contract.\n\n## Background\nThe current contract for services with Euler Labs Ltd. was entered into in May 2022 by the Euler Foundation, preceding the creation of the DAO. The contract covers research and development-related matters. Under the current contract, the Euler Foundation agreed to pay Euler Labs an estimated $5.7m USDC per year, for two years. Apart from complications arising from the events in 1Q2023, Euler Labs had been invoicing the Euler Foundation for its services on a calendar quarterly basis. The most recent invoice issued by Euler Labs was for 4Q2023.\n\n#### Current Contract Details\nBelow is a summary of the key aspects of the current contract:\n* Commenced 1 May 2022.\n* The contract term is 2 years.\n* The contract allows Euler Labs to invoice the Euler Foundation an estimated $5.7m USDC per year (inclusive of all audit and other third-party vendor costs).\n\n## Motivation\nSince Q2 2023 (post-protocol exploit), the Euler Foundation has engaged Euler Labs to contribute to the development of a suite of software products that were not expressly contemplated in the contract for services entered into in May 2022.\n\nEuler Labs would like to enter into a new contract for services with the Euler Foundation that more accurately reflects the scope of technical and administrative services provided by Euler Labs to the Euler Foundation. Below is a list of the protocols for which Euler Labs has provided services as a contributor under the existing contract:\n\n* Euler protocol (v2) - Consisting of the recently announced Euler Vault Kit (EVK), which abstracts and modularises the properties of a lending protocol to enable v2 to offer greater flexibility and security for users than v1.\n* Euler Vault Connecter (EVC) - A communications protocol mediating cross-talk between vaults, enabling their use as collateral for one another.\n* Euler Governance Platform (EGP) - A revamped governance page integrated with Snapshot and Tally enabling users to vote on both on-chain and off-chain governance proposals.\n* Euler Swap - A modular decentralised exchange designed to integrate with Euler v2.\n* Euler Synthetics - A development kit for deploying synthetic assets on top of Euler v2.\n* FeeFlow - A decentralised auction mechanism allowing Euler DAO to convert any fees it receives on any platform into an underlying asset of its choosing.\n* RewardStreams - A protocol for projects to reward markets on Euler v2 or EulerSwap in a decentralised manner and allow users to receive rewards without having to stake LP tokens.\n\nEuler Labs expects to continue to serve as a contributor under the new contract for these Euler ecosystem components. \n\nEuler Labs grew its personnel related to this engagement to 25 in order to provide to the Euler Foundation the services that it requested under the current contract. Euler Labs believes that it is important for Euler Labs team members to be aligned and incentivised as contributors to the Euler ecosystem. To this end, Euler Labs is requesting, on behalf of current and future contributors, that the Euler Foundation agree, under the new contract, to make a one-off token grant of 1.6m EUL tokens to be allocated to for this purpose. \n\nTo date, 5.4m EUL tokens (or 20.5%) have been made available to Euler Labs’ contributors. An additional 1.6m would bring the total to roughly 7.0m or approx 26.4% of total supply. This would bring Euler in line with related projects Compound ([26.2%](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/compound/tokenomics#:~:text=Compound%20%28COMP%29%20Tokenomics&text=The%20Initial%20token%20distribution%20of,is%20allocated%20to%20Founders%20%26%20Team)); Aave ([25.0%](https://icodrops.com/ethlend/)); Morpho ([29.0%](https://docs.morpho.org/concepts/governance/morpho-token/initial-distribution/)); Silo ([28.5%](https://silopedia.silo.finance/governance/token-allocation-and-vesting)). If approved, the tokens will be moved from the DAO’s [main treasury wallet](https://app.safe.global/balances?safe=eth:0xcAD001c30E96765aC90307669d578219D4fb1DCe) to its [EUL allocation wallet](https://app.safe.global/balances?safe=eth:0x25Aa4a183800EcaB962d84ccC7ada58d4e126992).\n\nAs the community is aware, the Euler Protocol is expected to relaunch in 2Q2024, subject to audit completion. The announcements to date relating to the re-launch of the Euler Protocol, and associated components include:\n* [EVC announcement](https://x.com/eulerfinance/status/1745433647078134029?s=20)\n* [Euler Governance Platform announcement](https://x.com/eulerfinance/status/1757455254126256201?s=20)\n* [Euler protocol \\(v2\\) announcement](https://x.com/eulerfinance/status/1760680857831133282?s=20)\n\n## Specification\nIf this proposal passes, the Euler Foundation will enter into a new contract for services with Euler Labs based on the scope of services outlined below. The remaining one months of the old contract entered into on 1 May 2022 will be cancelled. The effective start date of the new contract will be 1 April 2024.\n\n#### New Contract Details\nBelow is a summary of the key aspects of the new contract:\n* Dated from 1 April 2024 (2Q2024).\n* The term of the new contract will be one (1) year.\n* The contract will be reviewed and considered by the DAO annually hereafter.\n* The total value of the contract is [estimated to be $11.8m USDC](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vQzS7sGL18ZQ_83I8tV282rhm5Q46GydSZBcCLYSffnuyjuwZZD9E6sFSg0Zl9xrQmEsRTqkGEN7sP7/pubhtml?gid=1946158043&single=true).\n    * The proposal is based on a carefully prepared forecast. Euler Labs Limited maintains its books and records in GBP, in accordance with UK GAAP and the Companies Act.\n    * $4.1m of which is directly attributable to security-related services, which are expected to be performed by leading security firms such as Certora, Spearbit, Open Zeppelin, Chain Security, Trail of Bits, yAudit, Omniscia, and others.\n* One-off token grant of 1.6m EUL to be made available to Euler Labs for allocation to contributors.",

There are two proposed options for providing liquidity: $500K at full range or $500K at 90% below and 1000% above (with a 3 month range review).\n\nThis is done with the intention of getting liquidity off the ground, with market makers and mercenary LPs taking advantage of increased volume / fees in the future- as opposed to becoming the only solution for liquidity.\nMotivation\n\nMany potential participants in Euler’s ecosystem have expressed an interest in becoming stakeholders but are unable to do so due to poor liquidity. This restricts protocol growth and reduces critical decentralization efforts that need to occur if the protocol is to see its ecosystem flourish alongside the protocol itself.\n\nTo this end, the DAO should pair ETH with EUL from its treasury in one of two ways:\n\n1. $500K at full range.\n\nThis would cover the full range of liquidity and would require no rebalancing by the DAO at any point. It would facilitate relatively consistent throughout at all levels but comes at the cost of generating less fees for the DAO and is provably less efficient than concentrated liquidity in option 2.\n\n2. $500K at 90% below and 1000% above\n\nThis would provide cover for a wide range of liquidity for EUL/ETH AND would be the most efficient solution and generate the most fees, but an important downside to this option is that it requires review, which will be scheduled quarterly.\n\nCalculations to estimate efficiency and revenue can be made at the link below. At current volumes, there is a 4% APR (from fees) difference between option 1 (~7%) and 2 (~11%). If EUL becomes more liquid, this difference may increase.\nSpecification\n\nIf the vote meets quorum and option 1 or 2 has the most votes, the Euler Foundation will pair (on the day of execution) $250K in ETH with $250K in EUL, then deposit it into the Uniswap liquidity pool with the appropriate parameters.\n\nIf the vote does not reach quorum or option 3 receives the most votes, nothing will happen.\nVoting\n\nOption 1 = $500K at full range\n\nOption 2 = $500K at 90% down and 1000% up\n\nOption 3 = Do nothing\n\nRelevant links are available below",

As the protocol is not currently operational and we are unsure what the new version of Euler will look like, it does not make sense for the DAO to continue funding these grants. The DAO is now in a far different state than when these agreements were initially made. As such, we should revisit their benefit to the DAO. Ending these agreements would also allow these service providers the ability to propose new initiatives that could benefit Euler V2.\n\n# Motivation:\n\nEven though the Euler Protocol is not currently operational, the DAO is still spending money on tools, analysis, and grant programs. At present, these services are not needed and/or not possible due to the protocol being off. The DAO should consider ending these agreements. Stopping these grants would also allow the service providers to revamp their proposals to become better aligned to serve Euler V2.\n\nBelow is a breakdown of the DAO costs that should be re-evaluated.\n\n### [eGP 6: Grant Request for Defishy to Create VaR Simulation Model With Euler Liquidation Health Graph View Implemented in EGP1 ](https://snapshot.org/#/eulerdao.eth/proposal/0x65a56c2a7f8ce23a814786517a4d4d1eb340f7ebc5058af47898aef23c36a04a)\n\n**Cost:** $3,500 per Month\n\n**Motivation For Ending Payment:** As the protocol is non-operational there is no need for simulations or liquidation health graphs.\n\n### [Grant Proposal 7: Anthias x Euler Alert System Grant Proposal](https://snapshot.org/#/eulerdao.eth/proposal/0xe40ab4934c33710306a01b64bba7d3c0c58010d40e1f909ccae1a35c4ee8afef)\n\n**Cost**: $500 per Month\n\n**Motivation For Ending Payment**: As the protocol is non-operational there is no need for an alert system at this time.\n\n### [Grant Proposal 8 Warden Finance Risk & Tooling Engagement ](https://snapshot.org/#/eulerdao.eth/proposal/0x189c40fb6ba34be1a2aa78b29001b57e90060e13bb82652eab91989404bc24ae)\n\n**Cost:** $50,000 per Quarter\n\n**Motivation For Ending Payment**: As the protocol is non-operational there is no need for risk and analytics tools at this time. The Euler protocol will more than likely need these services once restarted but for now there is no work to be done.\n\n### [Grant Proposal 9: Delegated Domain Allocation by Questbook](https://snapshot.org/#/eulerdao.eth/proposal/0x52bfe2040c2a59093a1685f20802de31f92545c2d931e65716de07c390f3038f)\n\n**Cost**: $222,000 for 3 months\n\n**Motivation For Ending Payment**: As the protocol is not currently operational there is no need for a grants program. Additionally, with the uncertainty of what Euler will look like upon return, it would be beneficial to reevaluate this proposal and adjust it to the needs of the next version of the Euler Protocol.\n\n### [Encode Club Grant Proposal](https://snapshot.org/#/eulerdao.eth/proposal/0x76fb2890629949ed78e2bb595f55509d07812675056d962ebebd992024f8f16f)\n\n**Cost:** $30,000\n\n**Motivation For Ending Payment:** This payment was already sent to Encode. However, Encode was not able to distribute these funds to grants due to the hack. Since the dispersion of these funds for grants is not currently possible, it would be beneficial to the DAO if Encode returned these funds.\n\n# Specification/Body Text:\n\nThis proposal would stop the following Payments\n\n1. $3,500 per month to DeFishy (now called Anthias)\n2. $500 per month to Anthias\n3. $50,000 per quarter to Warden Finance\n4. $222,000 to Questbook\n\nAdditionally, this would request the return of the following to the DAO treasury\n\n1. $30,000 from Encode\n\nThese service providers could then resubmit grant proposals closer to the relaunch of the protocol with any necessary adjustments concerning the new and improved V2. It would then be up to the DAO whether or not to onboard them again.\n\n# Next steps\n\n1. Discuss which of these agreements the DAO would like to end.\n2. Vote on Snapshot\n3. Stop payments 1-4 mentioned above\n4.

      "content": "**Title:** [Fast Track] eiP 55 Withdraw STG from the Reserves before the upcoming reissuance\n\n**Author(s):** @carebbear\n\n**Related Discussions**: N/A\n\n**Submission Date:** March 6th, 2023\n\n## Simple Summary\n\nThe proposed action is to withdraw the STG (Stargate Finance) token from the project's reserves, hold it until an airdrop occurs, and then deposit it back into the reserves using a new contract.\n\n## Motivation\n\n\nIn light of the recent decision by the Stargate DAO to re-issue its tokens to all token holders and the upcoming STG airdrop scheduled for March 15th, it is recommended that STG holders withdraw their tokens from Euler to ensure they receive the airdropped tokens. The Euler Foundation made a decision on February 22, 2023, to pause STG borrowing on Euler to prevent borrowers from taking advantage of the airdrop by borrowing the STG and repaying with worthless old STG after the airdrop. This action bypassed the normal governance flow to avoid alerting potential attackers to the opportunity.\n\nTo protect the value of the STG reserves held on the Euler smart contract (127.13k STG), it is crucial to withdraw the tokens from the reserves and wait for the airdrop. After the airdrop, the new tokens should be deposited back into the reserves of a new STG market that will be activated. The urgency of this situation requires swift action, as the current governance process typically takes 14 days from start to finish.\n\nFailing to withdraw the reserves could create a potential vulnerability, allowing a potential attacker to steal the newly airdropped tokens. If the reserves are not withdrawn, new STG tokens will eventually be transferred to the Euler contract, which could be exploited by an attacker who front runs the transfer by opening a market for new STG token on Euler and deposit a small amount of new STG. When new STG tokens are received by the Euler Contract following the attacker's transaction, the amount transferred will affect the eSTG/STG exchange rate, essentially crediting the attacker with the received amount. Withdrawing the reserves before the airdrop is necessary to avoid this situation.\n\n**Relevant information:**\n\nOn March 15, the STG token will migrate to a new address. This was approved on [Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/stgdao.eth/proposal/0x26a68e276ab63195580c5100423c5db7177c9a0f15c74e5d8393812332b28836)\n\n[Stargate STG Migration User FAQ](https://commonwealth.im/stargatetoken/discussion/9972-stargate-stg-migration-user-faq).\n\n**Action to be taken:**\n\n1. Withdraw the STG token from the project's reserves.\n2. Wait for an airdrop.\n3. Deposit the STG token back into the reserves, but under a new contract.",

      "title": "EIP-54: Deploy Euler on Polygon zkEVM",
      "content": "Author(s): Jack Melnick (@jackmelnick_)\nSubmission Date: 2/28/2022\n\nSubmitted in the format laid out in [RFC] Formalizing Multichain Deployment 1\n\nPoint of Contact: Jack Melnick , DeFi Business Development Lead @ Polygon Labs\n\nTwo Sentence Summary: Over the past ~year, Euler has established itself as a premier permissionless DeFi lending market through implementation of its unique Tiered Lending system. To help in its growth trajectory, we would like to invite the team to launch Euler on Polygon zkEVM , (not PoS), following its deployment at the end of Q1, which is in line with Euler’s goal of an April multi-chain expansion & would allow them to meet any outstanding deployment commitments.\n\nProposal Overview: Polygon is the leading blockchain development platform, including solutions like Polygon PoS and Polygon zkEVM (first public EVM compatible L2 ZK rollup live on testnet). Polygon’s scaling solutions have seen widespread adoption with tens of thousands of decentralized applications hosted, 2.2B+ total transactions processed, 180M+ unique user addresses, and $2B+ in assets secured.\n\nThrough a combination of 400k+ active weekly wallets on the PoS chain and collaboration with mainstream brands like Robinhood, Polygon’s aim is to deploy dApps like Euler into broader and better-rounded markets. Reinforcing this goal, Polygon’s DeFi ecosystem has experienced consistent growth, irrespective of the market conditions, and continues to be the preferred destination for DeFi. From Ethereum blue chip protocols, like Aave, Uniswap v3, Curve, and LIDO to Prominent Polygon-native projects, such as QuickSwap, QiDao,and Gains Network, the success stories speak for themselves.\n\nAdditionally, Polygon’s DeFi ecosystem has already become self-sustainable. We effectively stopped the majority of liquidity mining incentives more than a year ago, yet continue seeing constant capital and user inflows, showing a clear path toward sustainable growth for deploying dApps.\n\nWe would provide as much support is needed over the course of Euler’s deployment process to ensure that all key concerns around risk, oracles, liquidity and more are all satisfied.\n\nMotivation, Rationale, and Key Goals:\n\nIncrease distribution and dApp discovery pathway: Users enable volume, and volume generates revenue for the protocol. Web2 giants like Robinhood have chosen Polygon to build their non-custodial wallets to enable dApp discovery, and enable dApps to capture more users (1.5M+ signups) through Polygon.\nMarketing Support: Polygon brings vibrant marketing support to help you showcase the product and capture a large audience base. Through this support, we can help GMX establish a global brand presence.\nzkEVM Launch: Polygon zkEVM will be launching by the end of Q1, allowing developers to easily port over EVM codebases onto a true Layer Two zero-knowledge scaling solution, the ‘holy grail of scalability’. On the testnet, over 84,000 wallet addresses have already been created, with ~300,000 transactions. You can find more info in the docs and zkEVM testnet explorer.\nstMatic - Euler can include the staked version of Matic. The underlying PoS yield will help provide sustainable lending rates, uncorrelated with bear market conditions. Liquid staking on Polygon has grown from 5m MATIC staked to 90m, and continues to grow as more use cases arise for MATIC liquid staked derivatives (LSDs).\nResilient and sticky liquidity - Polygon natively has resilient and sticky liquidity. Pools will have deep liquidity, with no need to worry about porting liquidity from mainnet. This Report from Messari gives an in-depth overview of the state of Polygon’s liquidity.\nNon-Technical Evaluation\n\nTVL on the Chain: $1.75b\nAmount of protocols on the chain: 1729\n(#) of unique addresses on the chain: 3,395,847, in the last month\n(#)of new users joining in the past 90 days: 6.47mn\n(#) of successful transactions per day: 2,865,756/day, 7 day moving average\nAverage gas fee in the past 30 days: Median gas fee over the last month has ranged between 60-163 gwei, having steadily increased over that period as PoS activity has risen. That said, even at a gas fee of 165 gwei, with a priority fee of 30 gwei, transaction fees are ~0.003 MATIC (~ 0.3 cents).\nBridging Process\n\nUpon deployment to zkEVM, the chain will switch to an LX-LY bridge.\n\nMore complete information on zkEVM, and its current state on testnet can be found in the developer documentation here.\n\nConsiderations & Planned Support for Deployment\n\nPolygon’s DeFi Team has experience supporting and onboarding new protocols into the ecosystem. As part of that process, the Euler team would have any necessary developer and marketing support to ensure a smooth and successful move.\n\nPolygon has avoid liquidity mining, as it can help attract new users, but ultimately doesn’t help attract sticky users that are beneficial for long term success of the project on a new chain. A number of projects, like Lido, have seen extremely successful deployments on Polygon (Dune Link for Ref) as a result of the effort that we’ve put into helping them find organic Product Market Fit on chain through partnerships and ensuring that their impressive product suite is available and noticed. The goal is to accomplish the same for Euler: consistent TVL, user, and product growth across a market that has massive demand for structure lending.\n\nVoting\n\nYes : Deploy Euler on zkEVM.\nNo: Make no changes.",

      "content": "Title : Grant Proposal 9 Delegated Domain Allocation by Questbook\n\nAuthor : [ruchil](https://twitter.com/roohchill)\n\nSubmission date - 18/02/2023\n\n### Summary\n\n- We (Questbook.xyz) propose the launch of Euler ecosystem growth fund of $222k (~0.26% of the treasury and ~0.8% of stables as on Feb 17th, 2023) spread across 1 quarter to fund a *wide variety* of teams building apps on top of Euler in a transparent manner. Questbook is also leading Compound grants program through delegated domain capital allocation model, a community-run grants program.\n- We additionally propose that this budget be managed by 4 **individuals called Domain Allocators - chosen from the community, by the community**. These domain allocators would manage grants for a *domain*. These domains are strategic areas of focus for which the Euler DAO wants to disburse grants\n- The performance of each of these *domain allocators* will be publicly viewable and auditable using rich dashboards. At the end of the quarter, the Euler community can vote to replace, continue domain allocators or increase budgets for each *domain allocator.*\n- We (Questbook.xyz) will help facilitate setting up these *domain allocators* and provide the tooling to run the grants program in an efficient and transparent way. We have previously set up or currently setting up the grants process for Compound, Polygon, Solana, Celo, and Aave\n\nDiscussion & more details to : https://forum.euler.finance/t/grant-proposal-9-delegated-domain-allocation-by-questbook/777/27?u=ruchil",

      "content": "**Title: eIP 52 Update the IRM models for wstETH, cbETH & rETH**\n**Author(s):** Warden Finance\n**Submission Date:** 02.17.2023\n\n# Simple Summary\nWe are proposing to modify the interest rate models for wstETH, cbETH and rETH markets\n\n* **Current IRM:** Mega (Base=0% APY, Kink(80%)=8% APY Max=200% APY)\n* **Proposed IRM:** Custom (Base=0% APY, Kink(70%)=5% APY Max=200% APY)\n\nThe goal of this proposal is to make it more capital efficient for traders to short LSD assets and mitigate the risks associated with the Shanghai upgrade.\n\n# Abstract\n### Shanghai upgrade\nEthereum's Shanghai upgrade will allow ETH stakers to remove their staked funds as validators, effectively making staked ether liquid.\n\nThis might cause a significant negative impact on LSD assets liquidity, since part of the purpose of these products is to allow staked ether to be traded. The reaction is hard to quantify since this is the first event of such nature.\n\n### State of Euler LSD Markets\nEuler’s current lending markets offering for LSD assets is the following:\n\n* wstETH ($130M supply, collateral tier)\n* cbETH ($29M supply, collateral tier)\n* stETH ($5.4M supply, collateral tier)\n* rETH (soon to be onboarded)\nwstETH and cbETH markets encompass 38% of total supply on Euler and 90% of its LSD markets total supply.\n\nHere’s a quick overview of the two markets\n\n**wstETH**\n* 27% utilization\n* 7.67% borrow apy, including staking yield\n**cbETH**\n* 17% utilization\n* 5.55% borrow apy, including staking yield\n\n# Motivation\n### Increase Borrow Activity\nUtilization for wstETH and cbETH markets are sitting low and effective borrow rates are high. Incentives are not sufficient for borrowers to trade on these markets due to the staking yield being added to Euler’s borrow APY.\n\nFor example, when utilization is at kink, the effective borrow rate for these markets are 13% (8% borrow APY + 5% staking yield).\n\nA kink of 5% instead of 8% (total = 10%) would incentivize more traders to borrow.\n\nThese markets would greatly benefit from an adapted IRM, which would take into consideration staking yields in order to adjust rates. A healthy target for utilization would be closer to the kink, at around 50% utilization (~2x current wstETH utilization and ~3x current cbETH utilization).\n\nHistorically, borrowers are willing to pay about 9% APY at maximum to short wstETH. We propose updating the kinks from 8% to 5%. This will pull back the combined interest rate at the kink to a more reasonable 10%.\n\n### Prepare for the Shanghai upgrade\nGiven the possibility of a liquidity shortfall event, we are proposing to move the kink of both assets at 70% utilization instead of 80%.\n\nAs of right now, these assets do have healthy amounts of on-chain liquidity:\n\n**wstETH (link to full report)**\n* $240m liquidity on 62 dex pools\n* 0.2% slippage for $5m trade size\n**cbETH (link to full report)**\n* $29m liquidity on 19 dex pools\n* 0.8% slippage for $5m trade size\n\nOf course, this is not fully representative of the liquidity profile after the Shanghai upgrade, but it gives a good starting point to look at. cbETH is definitely the most exposed to liquidity risk.\n\nMoving the kink lower by 10% will add a buffer of safety in case of extreme liquidity decrease.\n\n# Expexted Outcome\n### Increased utilization of wstETH and cbETH pools\n* More traders will be able to short wstETH and cbETH\n* Increased revenue for lenders\n* Increased revenue for the protocol\n\n### Risk\nLittle to no additional risk exposure for the protocol, given current utilization rates.\nLess risk exposure to the Shanghai upgrade.\n\n# Specification\nWe propose using the following model for both markets:\n\n**Current:** IRM Mega (Base=0% APY, Kink(80%)=8% APY Max=200% APY)\n**Proposed:** Custom (Base=0% APY, Kink(70%)=5% APY Max=200% APY)",

      "content": "**Title: [Grant Proposal 8] Warden Finance - Risk & Tooling Engagement**\n**Author:** Warden Finance\n**Related Discussions:** [N/A]\n**Submission Date:** 2023-02-17\n\n\n# Simple Summary\nThis proposal aims to formalize how Warden will continue supporting Euler in building and maintaining risk and analytics tools. The proposal aim to also formalize how we will contribute to the DAO by reviewing risk parameters on an ongoing basis to make sure they are well calibrated.\n\nNote that we have had discussions with Euler core team members regarding this proposal. Furthermore this proposal would fall outside of the current scope of the Questbook grant program making this proposal independent of Grant Proposal 9.\n\n# Who is Warden Finance?\n## Background\nWarden helps DeFi protocols identify and manage risks. With the help of our open analytics platform , we propose parameter recommendations based on our in-house research, participate in governance, and build custom risk tools.\n\nWarden has been contributing to Euler since Q1 2022 by building protocol’s main Dune dashboard, implementing the protocol’s subgraph and contributing to governance through proposals and discussions on the forum.\n\nSince then, we have also built a dedicated set of risk management tools for Euler through Warden Finance . The platform encompasses a set of tools for exploring DeFi accounts, running simulations, backtesting strategies and stress-testing protocols. Warden empowers everyone in the Euler community to make data-driven risk decisions.\n\n## How we have contributed to Euler so far\n* Euler Risk & Analytics Tooling (Jan '23)\n* eIP 47 - Promote rETH to collateral tier (Dec '22)\n* eIP 27 - Update the USDT IRM (Nov '22)\n* eIP 25 - Decrease UNI and LINK Collateral Factors (Nov ‘22)\n* Euler dApp Improvements (Nov ‘22)\n* Euler Subgraph (April '22)\n* Euler Dune Dashboard (Jan '22)\nSee Warden Finance’s full history on Euler forum\n\nWe have also been voting on most of the DAO’s snapshot votes.\n\n## Other DeFi Contributions\n* AAVE Risk & Analytics Tooling (Jan '23)\n* Dune Dashboards\n* Uniswap Data Tooling (Oct '22)\n* Notional Analytics Dashboard (Dec ‘21)\n\n# Our Values\n* **Transparency.** In the best interest of the community, our platform will always be accessible and open for feedback. We have created tools that are accessible to the public in order to make our proposals as transparent and cohesive as possible.\n* **Data-driven.** Every recommendation we make is based on cold hard data that is accessible and verifiable by anyone. Through the Warden Finance platform, we carry a holistic picture of the protocol and can accurately measure the impact of any change in the system.\n* **Quality.** Risk management is mission critical for protocols, and we believe the tools and recommendations should live up to that standard. We build products that are made to be used and meant to be trusted.\n\n# Abstract\nThis proposal lays the foundation for a 1-year engagement between the Euler DAO and Warden. Through this engagement, Warden Finance would continue contributing to the Euler ecosystem in the following areas:\n\n* **Tooling and infrastructure** - Maintain current infrastructure (Dune dashboard, Euler subgraph, risk tools on Warden) and add new features for Euler on the Warden platform. More details in the specifications below.\n* **Risk management** - In collaboration with the core team, actively contribute to protocol’s risk management through governance recommendations and reviews. We propose to publish monthly risk reviews where we validate that the protocol’s governance parameters are well calibrated (CF, BF, IRMs, borrow and supply caps).\n\n# Motivation\nContribute to making sure Euler governance parameters are well calibrated\n* Parameters need to be assessed on a regular basis to account for ever changing market conditions.\n* We will make sure parameters are adequate based on market conditions and remain competitive with other protocols.\nMake sure infrastructure is well maintained and can be used by external partners\n* Warden has helped and is willing to keep being the primary contributor for the dune dashboard and subgraph work.\nHelp with decentralization of the protocol\n*Engage Warden as a key contributor for the longer term to help with the aforementioned needs.\n\n# Specification & Implementation\n## Tooling and infrastructure for Euler\n* Warden platform additions\n* LSD monitoring\n* Governance parameters monitoring\n* New asset onboarding\n* Market parameter and interest rate model benchmarking\n* Infrastructure maintenance and updates\n* Maintenance and rework of Euler Dune dashboard\n* Subgraph updates (Add governance parameters, various fix related to positions)\n* Develop a data extraction tool for Euler subgraph (similar to this ) to simplify querying on-chain data for Euler community members.\n\n## Monthly risk assessment reports & recommendations\nWe will work with the Euler core risk team to review governance parameters for all active markets and propose recommendations based on our analyses. More specifically we will review the following parameters:\n* Collateral / borrow factors\n* Borrow / supply caps\n* Interest Rate Models (base rate, kink rate, max rate, kink utilization, reserve fees)\n* Treasury (harvesting decisions & adjacent recommendations)\n\n# Budget and timeline\n**Budget:** $50K per quarter. With the first payment paid up front as suggested by jengajojo on the forum.\n\n**Period:** Feb 2023 to Feb 2024 (1 year)\n\nWe are a team of three (Hugo Boisselle, David Dallaire & Philippe Labrecque) with deep experience in crypto, tech, and finance. The proposed grant will cover infrastructure cost ($3K-$5K per month to run our simulation platform) as well as contributors time and expertise.\n\nWe will post quarterly updates on what we have delivered to the DAO and post monthly risk assessments on the Forum.\n\n## Review period\nWe propose a 3 month review period where the DAO can terminate the engagement if it is not satisfied by our performance. Given our track record and past contributions we think it is unlikely that such action should be taken.",

      "title": "Grant Proposal 7: Anthias x Euler Alert System Grant Proposal",
      "content": "**Title: RFC Anthias to Create Alert System for EulerDAO**\n\nAuthor(s): Charlie Ambrose, Alex Craig, Luke Xie (Founders of Anthias.xyz)\n\n**Related Discussions**: N/A\n\n**Submission Date** : January 29th, 2023\n\n### **Simple Summary**\nWe are proposing a grant to further our work from eGP6 by building a Discord alert system for the Euler community that will alert users of major compromises to their own positions on Euler as well as the positions of whales that may affect their positions. This alert system would be tailored for the Euler community to provide Euler users with the exact information they need to manage position risk, incentivizing healthy positions and the health of the protocol as a whole. Currently, Anthias x Euler users need to monitor their positions and those of whales manually on Anthias.xyz. While this has many benefits, users will benefit from receiving direct notifications of the information they need to more effectively manage risk.\n\n###  **Abstract**\nThe Anthias team is composed of three members of Dartmouth Blockchain. Our philosophy is to continually provide value to the blockchain ecosystem through shipping useful products and research. The Anthias team consists of three individuals with development, design, and growth experience. We have extensive experience in DeFi, having contributed at Primitive Finance, Yeti Finance, NEAR, and more.\n\n###  **Motivation**\nRisk management in DeFi is a theme that has gained incredible strength since the collapse of Terra/Luna and only became stronger after the collapse of FTX. Managing risk on Euler via Anthias currently involves frequent monitoring of one’s positions and the Euler market as a whole via Anthias.xyz. This is not totally sufficient in a time of duress when one needs to know of an issue quickly and make an informed decision with speed. An Euler-specific alert system will increase risk management on Euler by alerting users directly of information they need to know, so they can make those necessary decisions. Not only will it be great for current users, but it will be another great way to attract new users to Euler, knowing that they are getting the best risk protection in all of DeFi borrowing and lending.\n\n###  **Proven Euler Shippers**\n* In August of 2022, the Anthias team completed eGP1 for Euler, which is currently live on Anthias.xyz. The grant led to previously unforeseen insights for Euler users and the Euler team. eGP1 was started on 8/10/22 and finished within its expected timeline on 8/31/22. The current dashboard allows users to view current liquidation health scores across Euler and helps to prevent further liquidation cascades like the one seen in May 2022.\n* In January of 2023, the Anthias team completed eGP6 for Euler. eGP6 democratized access to Value at Risk modeling for the Euler community as well as provided a more in-depth view into individual wallets via the Wallet View. Along with these two new views, the team shipped a more advanced filtering system on both the Table View and Graph View, so users can sort by specified assets and liquidation health scores. Working with the Euler community for these grants has been an awesome experience, and we look forward to continue building.\n\n\n###  **Specification & Implementation**\nWe are requesting a $15k initial grant (all $15k to be paid upon completion of the grant deliverables–-no payment required upfront) and $500 recurring on a monthly basis (paid on the first of each subsequent month the Euler community wants the alert system to be live, starting once the initial grant work is complete) to fund the development of a full data analytics/risk management alert system for Euler. The alert system will give users the ability to receive direct alerts (via either Discord DM, email, or text) for the following:\n\n* If selected wallets’ liquidation health score drops below a specified threshold\n* If the price of specified tokens drops by a certain percentage\n* If the aggregate health score of the Euler protocol drops below a specified threshold\n* If selected wallets are liquidated or at risk of liquidation\n\nThe system will also include a signup/login page on Anthias.xyz where Euler users can make an account and select the different items they would like to be notified for. Here users will also be able to see a list view of all their past Anthias notifications in case they would prefer to track there. This will be live at app.Anthias.xyz/euler-eth.\n\n\n###  **How long will development take?**\nWe estimate development time to take ~8-10 weeks from the proposal vote going through. Based on feedback from community members, we will continue iterating and shipping out new and useful features.\n\n\n###  **What will the grant payment be used for?**\nTotal upon completion = $15k\n\n* $15k Breakdown:\n  * $14k - contributor compensation for initial grant deliverable work\n  * $1k - initial storage, database, and app upgrade costs\n\nTotal per month starting first month after grant is shipped = $500\n\n* $300 per month - team compensation to maintain app, maintain database, make adjustments, take feedback after set development date is complete, etc\n* $200 per month - app upkeep costs\n- Server hosting (~$150/month)\n- API costs for notifications (~$50/month)\n\nThis contributor compensation is not retroactive for any updates we make to the current dashboards from eGP1 or eGP6. It is for our team to cover each member’s time cost to work on the grant over the allotted time frame and will cover design, frontend, backend, inspecting smart contracts, etc.",

      "title": "eIP 51 Update EUL Distribution Scheme to incentivize ETH deposits",
      "content": "**Title**: eIP 51 Update EUL Distribution Scheme to incentivize ETH deposits\n**Author**(s): @Matt_StableNode @Bobbay_StableNode\n**Related Discussions**: [eIP 24](https://forum.euler.finance/t/eip-24-update-the-eul-distribution-scheme/462), [EUL Staking Assessment](https://forum.euler.finance/t/eul-staking-assessment/634), [eIP 47](https://forum.euler.finance/t/eip-47-promote-reth-to-collateral-tier-contingent-on-chainlink-deploying-a-proper-oracle/525)\n**Submission Date**: February 3rd, 2023\n\n# Simple Summary:\n\nUpdate the EUL distribution scheme to incentivize increased ETH TVL and better match the protocol desires for EUL distribution. This aims to improve trading opportunities for Euler's users and attract more users looking to enter ETH LSD markets on Euler.\n\n# Abstract\n\nThis proposal aims to update the EUL distribution scheme to better align with the needs of Eulers’ users. With a combination of the reflection of the success of the original EUL reward distribution with the Shanghai update approaching soon, there is a lot of focus on ETH LSDs and possible trading strategies.\n\nIn order to enable Euler users to get the most out of this, Euler needs to increase the WETH TVL on Euler; we propose to amend the EUL distribution amongst the gauges and staking to better reflect the usage of Euler protocol.\n\n# Motivation\n\nCurrently, Euler has [93.64M stETH ](https://app.euler.finance/market/0x7f39c581f595b53c5cb19bd0b3f8da6c935e2ca0)available, [23.34M cbETH available](https://app.euler.finance/market/0xbe9895146f7af43049ca1c1ae358b0541ea49704), and soon possibly [rETH](https://forum.euler.finance/t/eip-47-promote-reth-to-collateral-tier-contingent-on-chainlink-deploying-a-proper-oracle/525), but only [18.92M WETH ](https://app.euler.finance/market/0xc02aaa39b223fe8d0a0e5c4f27ead9083c756cc2)available. This means traders attempting to loop ETH LSDs, and WETH do not have enough WETH to borrow for these trades.\n\nTo make this trade more appealing to traders, the WETH TVL needs to increase dramatically. One way to incentivize higher WETH TLV is to increase EUL rewards for staking WETH on Euler. Providing sufficient WETH availability could attract many new users to Euler that are looking to execute these types of trades\n\nWithout causing additional costs to Euler DAO, we can amend EUL distribution to make this reward program more capital efficient.\n\n# Specification\n\n## Current EUL Distribution\n\nEuler currently distributes 55k EUL per epoch since [eIP 24](https://snapshot.org/#/eulerdao.eth/proposal/0x7e65ffa930507d9116ebc83663000ade6ff93fc452f437a3e95d755ccc324f93).\n\n* 5,000 EUL per epoch to stakers of each of USDC, USDT, WETH markets (15,000 per epoch in total).\n* 8,000 EUL per epoch via gauges to borrowers on each of USDC, USDT, WETH, and WStETH markets (32,000 per epoch in total).\n* 8,000 EUL per epoch shared proportionally among all assets with a Chainlink oracle (either now or in the future) (8,000 per epoch in total).\n\n## Proposed Change to Gauge Distribution\n\n* Remove the 8000 EUL allocation for USDT in the gauges.\n\nUSDT had the 4th highest EUL distribution for epoch 21 but the [16th most votes](https://app.euler.finance/gauges). WETH, StETH, and USDC, however, are all top 5 vote-getters. This clearly demonstrates that borrowers are not as interested in USDT as they are in the three other assets that receive the automatic 8000 EUL per epoch.\n\nFor this reason, we believe the automatic 8000 EUL allocation for USDT is no longer reflective of Euler users’ desires and should be removed. It would be a more efficient market to let voters decide how much EUL the USDT gauge receives.\n\nThe current [utilization of USDT is 58%](https://app.euler.finance/market/0xdac17f958d2ee523a2206206994597c13d831ec7), meaning there is plenty of USDT available, and there is not currently a need to heavily incentivize an increase in USDT TVL. Additionally, USDT currently has the least value staked of any asset available to be staked on Euler and is the only asset to decrease in the amount staked over the last three months.\n\n## Proposed Change to Staking Rewards\n\n### USDT Staking Rewards\n\n* Reduce the USDT staking EUL distribution from 5000 EUL to 1000 EUL per epoch.\n* Extend the staking reward program until a vote passes to remove it. \n\nThe amount of USDT staked on Euler has [gone down over the last 3 months](https://www.warden.finance/explore/accounts/0x7882f919e3acca984babd70529100f937d90f860), while the amount of [USDC](https://www.warden.finance/explore/accounts/0xe5afe81e63f0a52a3a03b922b30f73b8ce74d570) and [WETH](https://www.warden.finance/explore/accounts/0x229443bf7f1297192394b7127427db172a5bde9e) staked on Euler has increased over the same time period. This shows that Euler users are less interested in staking USDT, and the rewards would be better used to reward WETH stakers.\n\nFinally, the current [utilization of USDT is 58%](https://app.euler.finance/market/0xdac17f958d2ee523a2206206994597c13d831ec7), meaning there is plenty of USDT available to be used, and there is not currently a need to incentivize an increase in USDT TVL heavily.\n\nThis reduction in 4000 EUL can be moved over to the WETH staking rewards reference in the next section. This would allow increased incentives for WETH Staking without causing additional costs to Euler DAO.\n\n### WETH Staking Rewards\n\n* Increase the WETH staking EUL distribution from 5000 EUL to 9000 EUL.\n* Extend the staking reward program until a vote passes to remove it.\n\nCurrently, the amount of available WETH on Euler is only about ⅙ of the amount of ETH LSDs available, and this problem will only be made worse when [eIP 47](https://forum.euler.finance/t/eip-47-promote-reth-to-collateral-tier-contingent-on-chainlink-deploying-a-proper-oracle/525) passes.\n\nIncreasing WETH staking rewards would increase incentives to stake WETH and therefore increase WETH TVL. This would make much more WETH available to those looking to loop ETH LSDs with WETH, which could attract new users to Euler and earn the protocol more in fees.\n\n## Proposed New EUL Distribution\n\n47K EUL Distributed accordingly:\n\n* 9,000 EUL per epoch to stakers of WETH market.\n* 5,000 EUL per epoch to stakers of USDC market.\n* 1,000 EUL per epoch to stakers of USDT market.\n* 8,000 EUL per epoch via gauges to borrowers on each of USDC, WETH, and WStETH\n* 8,000 EUL per epoch shared proportionally among assets with Chainlink oracle\n\n# Next steps:\n\n* Remove automatic 8000 EUL allocation for USDT in the gauges.\n  * Let EUL distribution be voted on by the gauge system and allocated from the 8000 EUL shared proportionally among all assets with a Chainlink oracle.\n* Reduce the USDT staking EUL distribution from 5000 EUL to 1000 EUL.\n* Increase the WETH staking EUL distribution from 5000 EUL to 9000 EUL.\n* Extend the staking rewards program past the initial 3-month trial and continue it until another vote is passed to end the program.\n\n# Relevant Links:\n\n* [WETH Staking Stats](https://www.warden.finance/explore/accounts/0x229443bf7f1297192394b7127427db172a5bde9e), [USDC Staking Stats](https://www.warden.finance/explore/accounts/0xe5afe81e63f0a52a3a03b922b30f73b8ce74d570), [USDT Staking Stats](https://www.warden.finance/explore/accounts/0x7882f919e3acca984babd70529100f937d90f860)\n* [Euler StETH Market](https://app.euler.finance/market/0x7f39c581f595b53c5cb19bd0b3f8da6c935e2ca0), [Euler cbETH Market](https://app.euler.finance/market/0xbe9895146f7af43049ca1c1ae358b0541ea49704), [Euler WETH Market](https://app.euler.finance/market/0xc02aaa39b223fe8d0a0e5c4f27ead9083c756cc2), [Euler USDT Market](https://app.euler.finance/market/0xdac17f958d2ee523a2206206994597c13d831ec7)\n* [Euler Gauge EUL Distributions and Votes](https://app.euler.finance/gauges)\n* [eIP 24](https://forum.euler.finance/t/eip-24-update-the-eul-distribution-scheme/462), [eIP 47](https://forum.euler.finance/t/eip-47-promote-reth-to-collateral-tier-contingent-on-chainlink-deploying-a-proper-oracle/525), [EUL Staking Assessment](https://forum.euler.finance/t/eul-staking-assessment/634)\n\n# Pros and Cons of This Proposal:\n\n## Pros\n\n* Incentivizes more WETH TVL\n* Makes Euler more appealing to traders exploring STETH/ETH, CBETH/ETH, and future RETH/ETH markets\n* Could attract more users to Euler leading to more revenue for Euler\n* Saves EulerDAO 8,000 EUL per epoch which could later be used to incentivize other gauges\n\n## Cons\n\n* Less incentive to stake USDT\n* Less incentive to borrow USDT\n\n# Voting\n\nOption 1: Yes - Update EUL distribution\nOption 2: No - Make no change\nOption 3: Abstain\n",

      "content": "**Title:** eIP 50: Increase Snapshot Quorum\n**Author:** @Bobbay_StableLab , @Matt_StableNode\n**Related Discussions:** NA\n**Submission Date:** 03/02/23\n\n## Simple Summary\n\neIP-50 aims to increase the Snapshot quorum to a more suitable level since a few individual voters can reach quorum on their own.\n\n## Abstract\n\nQuorum enables a wide range of people to voice their opinion, but in the current state, these voices can be unheard since a few active voters can automatically reach quorum on their own.\n\neIP-50 will raise the Snapshot quorum to ensure that more voices will be heard and represented in making decisions for Euler DAO.\n\n## Motivation\n\nIn its current form, the quorum is useless since it is too low. As Euler governance requires a minimum quorum and a majority vote (51%), the protocol can be at risk of malicious attacks.\n\nEuler governance is fortunate to have an active governance community, but to decrease the risk of attack, the quorum should be raised to a more suitable level.\n\n## Specification\n\nUsing the consistent voters, there are around four active voters with > 9k voting power, totaling 63,000.\n\n|Address|Voting Power|\n| --- | --- |\n|0x11099aC9Cc097d0C9759635b8e16c6a91ECC43dA|26,000|\n|0x66cD62c6F8A4BB0Cd8720488BCBd1A6221B765F9|15,000|\n|0x31f45f2278a23Ef31A5485d3Aa98178e7F39710d|13,000|\n|0xeD95cbd2185924807e3B893B7E7Ac5dFE2efe33F|9,700|\n\nLooking at the [most recent votes](https://snapshot.org/#/eulerdao.eth), hitting at least 50k has not been a problem. Increasing to 50k might be a more suitable number for now.\n\nLemniscap and other individuals have >50k, but we aren’t aware of their governance activity and whether they will continue to vote. For now, we will be excluding them since there are always a few whales, and we shouldn’t use these outliers to base the minimum quorum since they might stop participating.\n\n## Implementation\n\nThis would require Euler Labs to adjust the Snapshot quorum, and all future votes will now require a minimum of 50k Euler Voting power & majority to pass.\n\n## Voting\n\nOption 1: Yes: Raise the Snapshot quorum to 50k\nOption 2: No: Do not make any changes to the snapshot quorum\nOption 3: Abstain\n\n\n",

      "title": "​ RFC: Deploy Euler to BNB Chain",
      "content": "Title: RFC: Deploy Euler to BNB Chain\n\nAuthor(s): AdamBNB on behalf of BNB Chain Foundation\n\nRelated Discussions: N/A\n\nSubmission Date: 18th Jan 2023\n\nSummary\n\nThe BNB Chain team proposes the Euler community to support the deployment of the project on BNB Chain. We believe that the goals of BNB Chain and Euler align perfectly, turning a possible collaboration into an event that could prove quite fruitful for both parties. In this proposal, we will develop the rationale by which we believe this to be true.\n\nBNB Chain is fully supporting the Euler community and its contributors on its vibrant journey and fully understands how challenging the development of a top project might be. Keeping up with the market requires intense work from the developers, management, and the community. If we add to these challenges new collaborations, there are numerous incentives to align and puzzle pieces to fit. Therefore BNB Chain remains mindful of Euler’s development and plans, leaving open to Euler DAO and its community when a deployment on our chain would best fit their roadmap.\n\nBNB Chain\n\nBNB Chain is a decentralized Layer 1 EVM compatible that uses Proof of Staked Authority (PoSA) as the consensus mechanism. At the time of writing, it has 26 active independents validators, we are looking forward to increasing (to 41 active validators) this number in the near future. In Q3 the Nakamoto coefficient of the network has increased to 8, a figure that falls within the industry median. BNB Chain is composed of the BNB Beacon Chain (previously Binance Chain) and BNB Smart Chain (previously Binance Smart Chain). BNB Chain is known for its short block time – the average block time is 3 seconds – and low fees.\n\nBNB Chain has a wide and active DeFi Ecosystem with the second largest TVL after Ethereum. The biggest project – in terms of volume and TVL – is PancakeSwap, the DEX with the third highest TVL (~$2.3B) across chains and also has one of the highest daily volumes granting a high degree of liquidity to many supported assets. Other dexes such as BiSwap, DODO, and iZumi also play an important role in the ecosystem, enhancing the liquidity available on the chain. Venus is the most important BNB lending project with about $700M in TVL (4th biggest lending protocol). Since September, Liquid Staking has been gaining more and more traction, by delivering new use cases to the holders of BNB. Wombat is the largest stableswap protocol on BNBChain. With a TVL of more than $100M, it has been able to handle volumes of more than $400M on peak days. These are only a handful of the hundreds of Defi projects that exist on BNBChain, which is the second most active DeFi protocol after Ethereum. The trading volume of BNB DeFi Dapps is also among the highest across chains.\n\nThe greatest strength of BNB Chain is its community and user base. BNBChain is the chain with the most daily active users, the most transactions, and also the chain with the most unique active wallets. We believe that the chain’s greatest asset is this community.\n\nData\n\nBNB Chain had 1M DAU and an average of 2.5M to 3M transactions per day during October. During Q2 of 2022, BNBChain had 427,134 unique active wallets, which accounts for 20.26% of all UAWs\nIn Q3 of 2022, BNBChain was the second biggest DeFi chain with a TVL of $7.6 billion, experiencing a 28.67% increase from Q2 2022\nAt the time of writing BNBChain TVL is ~$6.7 billion; the chain has not experienced significant outflows and the decrease in value locked can be mainly attributed to the sharp decline of crypto asset prices after the market events of the second week of November\nBNBChain’s TVL market share has been steadily growing since January. On May 15, the BNBChain TVL market share was 6.7%. Today it holds over 9%\nThe main assets by volume are BNB, BTC, ETH, CAKE, BUSD, USDC, and USDT, which could be considered for the first batch of assets composing the initial GLP pool on BNBChain. Nevertheless, we remain open to suggestions\nBNBChain also supports a large set of wrapped or pegged tokens that could be relevant for Euler lending pools (ETH, BTC, … are within this list)\nTechnical framework\n\nChainlink, Pyth (through Wormhole), Binance Oracle, and The Graph fully support BNBChain. Nodereal, Ankr, InfStones, Quicknode, and Chainstack are the public RPCs and BSC Scan is the reference token tracker of the network.\n\nBNBChain actively audits the network and its smart contracts with a robust set of security providers. Some of the audits have been performed by PeckShield, VeriChain, CertiK, and Quantstamp, and their results are publicly available. BNBChain runs several initiatives focused on security such as Avenger DAO, a community-run security infrastructure project designed to protect users on BNBChain from possible exploits, scams, and malicious actors.\n\nMotivation\n\nThe BNBChain team has been closely monitoring Euler’s development over the past few months, watching how the Euler protocol has been hitting one milestone after another. The fact that Euler has been one of the lending protocols that has experienced the best performance during this year marked by bearish sentiment has not gone unnoticed. We believe that this behavior has been similar to that of BNBChain, which has strongly established itself as the second chain in all the most relevant metrics, ending the year with a TVL market share of almost 10% across chains, having started the year at 6%. This strength has made it clear that both projects are in high demand, so we believe the time is right to collaborate more closely.\n\nBNB is the second chain with the most TVL, at the time of writing these lines, more than $5.2B, holding a market share of more than 9%. The success of Venus proves the demand that there is in the chain for solid lending projects and the capital available in it. BNBChain is the native chain of projects such as Pancakeswap or Alpaca, with which any project deployed on the chain can generate interesting synergies. This is the background that we believe Euler’s governance must take into account when assessing this proposal.\n\nOn top of this background, we want to add some more color to our value proposition for Euler. BNBChain is completely EVM so the deployment in the chain would be easier, in addition, the BNB team remains at the disposal of Euler DAO and its contributors to make the development and deployment as smooth as possible, either with their means or by contacting them with the relevant teams of our ecosystem.\n\nAdditionally, we believe that one of the most important points is the user base of BNBChain, considerably different from that of Ethereum or its various scalability solutions. BNB is the reference chain for retail, Euler would have access to a totally different pool of users and capital that he could capture with his deployment. This user base combined with a permissionless listing protocol could generate some interesting activity. BNB would also add an extra degree of geographic diversification of both users and capital to its existing offering. Lastly, Euler could use both BNB and BUSD, two of the most demanded assets with the highest volume and liquidity in circulation.\n\nWe believe that this set of facts justifies our proposition, as well as what is the value proposition and USP of BNBChain. For our chain, the benefit of bringing in Euler is clear. Being able to offer our users one of the lending projects that has not only been consistently delivering in recent months but has also managed to solve various inefficiencies in the lending market. Euler has focused a large part of its development not only on improvements in financial design (for example, the two-sided risk-adjusted borrowing capacity) but has given great importance to the protection and security of its users, from their depositors or debtors to their customers. liquidators, implementing an innovative model of MEV-resistance liquidations. BNB users would greatly benefit from Euler. The landing of a new player of Euler’s level would also encourage competition in the ecosystem, which will bring us one step closer to the path of efficiency and increased security.\n\nImplementation\n\nThe Euler deployment on BNBChain would be a full deployment of all Euler functionalities. It is up to DAO to propose which assets would be the first to be used in the lending market. We invite Euler governance to discuss this topic on this channel.\n\nCollaboration\n\nTo ensure the success of Euler on BNBChain, BNBChain could carry out a series of initiatives and promotions. These initiatives range from joint promotion (once the minimum requirements for security and other parameters are met), AMA, and joint-twitter spaces to putting the Euler Labs team in contact with ecosystem partners. Any initiative that the Euler community believes can strengthen the position of the protocol in BNB is more than welcome to be discussed in the forum.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn this proposal, we have tried to present as clearly as possible what BNBChain’s value proposition is for Euler and how we believe that a collaboration between both projects could generate a more than positive impact on both ecosystems. We have addressed the most relevant information as well as concerns that we have encountered in the past. Even so, we remain at the disposal of the governance to discuss possible issues or proposals that may appear by kicking off this discussion. We hope this is the first step in a fruitful and long collaboration.\n\nVoting\n\nShould this proposal pass the temperature check, we suggest voting in two ways:\n\nYes: deploy Euler to BNB Chain\n\nNo: make no changes",

      "content": "Authors: [@Matt_StableNode](https://forum.euler.finance/u/matt_stablenode), @Bobbay_StableNode\n\n\nRelated Discussions:\n[Related SAFE Airdrop Discussion](https://forum.euler.finance/t/rfc-safe-airdrop-claim-and-delegation/496/15),\n[[RFC] Delegate SAFE Airdrop to Stable Lab,](https://forum.euler.finance/t/rfc-delegate-safe-airdrop-to-stable-lab/534)\n[EIP 35: Claiming SAFE Airdrop](https://snapshot.org/#/eulerdao.eth/proposal/0x432e4d3993af3642550446163b862a327b87a14454b00d5f30e974382dbefaa5)\n\n\n## Summary:\n\n\nEuler currently has 3,010.40 SAFE tokens in [this Euler wallet](https://etherscan.io/address/0xE130bA997B941f159ADc597F0d89a328554D4B3E#tokentxns) from claiming the [SAFE airdrop](https://gnosis-safe.io/app/eth:0xcAD001c30E96765aC90307669d578219D4fb1DCe/transactions/queue) after [eIP 35](https://snapshot.org/#/eulerdao.eth/proposal/0x432e4d3993af3642550446163b862a327b87a14454b00d5f30e974382dbefaa5) passed. This proposal aims to delegate the SAFE tokens to StableLab or DAOstewards.\n\n\n## Abstract:\n\n\nEuler claimed 7,972.59 SAFE tokens and currently has 3,010.40 in [this Euler wallet](https://etherscan.io/address/0xE130bA997B941f159ADc597F0d89a328554D4B3E#tokentxns). These tokens give holders voting power in SafeDAO. This will allow Euler to have a say in Safe Governance and help to ensure the protocol moves in a positive direction, keeping the Euler treasury safe.\n\n\nThis proposal aims to delegate SAFE voting power to StableLab or the DAOstewards, to ensure that the tokens are managed responsibly.\n\n\n## Motivation:\n\n\nNow that Euler DAO has claimed SAFE tokens, It is beneficial for Euler to participate in SafeDAO to make sure Safe remains a good tool to use to keep the Euler treasury in. However, it can be time-consuming to stay up to date with the inner workings of a DAO. The core team at Euler most likely does not have the time to stay actively engaged in SAFE DAO. For this reason, we suggest Euler delegates their Safe to either Stable Lab or DAOstewards.\n\n\nAs multiple delegates are vying for the SAFE delegation, the format of this proposal allows the Euler community to choose which delegate they want to delegate the SAFE to.\n\n\n## Specification\n\n\n1. Prospective delegates\n2. StableLab\n3. DAOStewards\n4. Expectation\n5. Re-delegation\n\n\n### Prospective Delegates\n\n\n#### StableLab\n\n\n##### StableLab Euler Engagements\n\n\nStable Lab joined the Euler community in November after participating in an Euler governance workshop at DevCon. Since joining the community we have been active members of the community voting on 100% of votes since joining and providing our reasoning behind all our votes in our [delegate thread](https://forum.euler.finance/t/stable-lab-delegate-thread/556).\n\n\nAdditionally, we have been active in the forum, sharing our opinions on proposals and discussions. We took feedback from the Euler community to understand their feeling and author [eIP 35](https://forum.euler.finance/t/eip-35-claiming-and-delegating-safe-airdrop/544) to best reflect the needs of the DAO and ensure the airdrop was claimed.\n\n\nHowever, we are also not afraid to speak our minds when we disagree with the community. When in the [recognized delegate compensation discussion](https://forum.euler.finance/t/rfc-delegate-optimisations-in-governance-2-recognised-delegates/547/2), we voiced our [apprehension](https://forum.euler.finance/t/rfc-delegate-optimisations-in-governance-2-recognised-delegates/547/16) about the proposal and pointed out some of the centralized aspects of the proposal and offered alternative solutions even though the majority of the community seemed to be in favor of the proposal. Our mission is to help protocols become more decentralized safely and we will always provide our thoughts on how Euler can accomplish this mission.\n\n\nFinally, during [eIP 36 Fast track - Module updates, ](https://snapshot.org/#/eulerdao.eth/proposal/0xef1c55dc920cfbf6f89979e011a4c2747f72c0eccd8ece2a19e9404b12b9611d)the Stable Lab team helped give the Euler team recommendations based on experience in other DAOs on how to handle an urgent matter calmly and efficiently.\n\n\n##### StableLab Safe Engagements\n\n\nStable Lab also joined Safe DAO as a [delegate](https://forum.gnosis-safe.io/t/stablelab-delegate-thread/1942) in November. We currently serve as a Safe delegate for Element Finance and were voted with [99.99% approval](https://snapshot.org/#/1inch.eth/proposal/0xbdf3447c3bbefe628adaf4f9addb814548000142e417c93dfe665b8fea59bcd1) to serve as the 1inch Safe delegate, but unfortunately, the 1inch proposal did not reach quorum and the SAFE was not claimed before the airdrop claim deadline.\n\n\nSince joining Safe DAO, we have voted on 100% of the proposals and are one of only three delegates in Safe DAO that has provided [our reasoning](https://forum.gnosis-safe.io/t/stablelab-delegate-thread/1942) for every vote to the community. We are helping Safe DAO become more decentralized in a safe way by [voting against enabling ](https://forum.gnosis-safe.io/t/stablelab-delegate-thread/1942/2?u=matt_stablenode)token transfers as we felt the DAO was not yet mature enough and didn’t yet have a plan in place to deal with the enabling of token transfers. We hope to continue to help Safe DAO mature and would be happy to provide our thoughts on every Safe proposal to the Euler community.\n\n\nYou can also find more information about our work in other DAOs [here](https://forum.euler.finance/t/rfc-delegate-safe-airdrop-to-stable-lab/534).\n\n\n#### DAOstewards\n\n\n##### DAOstewards engagement at Euler\n\n\nWe joined EulerDAO in November 2022 and are actively taking part DAOs decision-making and trying to set new standards. During the short period, we have authored 4 proposals in different phases of the governance process.\n\n\n1. [eIP 33 SAFE Airdrop Claim and Delegation ](https://snapshot.org/#/eulerdao.eth/proposal/0xe91b62c43a0f9ff457d53c015f05ce50f729cb51cc139d01c4d4d8302f4c19d6)\n2.

Euler.finance](https://forum.euler.finance/t/rfc-bankless-academy-lending-and-borrowing-lesson-ft-euler-finance/605)\n\n\nOur pre-RFC proposal on updating the governance process has given birth to 2 proposals from independent authors. in our opinion, this is the ideal way of decentralised participation and proposal building\n\n\n1.

[Allow token holders/delegates to vote “abstain”](https://forum.euler.finance/t/allow-token-holders-delegates-to-vote-abstain/568)\n\n\nTrack our commitment and our Our Scope of Work on [our delegation tread](https://forum.euler.finance/t/daostewards-general-delegation-thread/524)\n\n\n##### DAOstewards engagement at Safe DAO\n\n\nWe joined Safe DAO in October 2022 as SafeDAO, one of the first professional delegate groups to join the DAO. Since joining Safe, we have maintained 100% DAO participation in giving feedback to existing proposals and helping authors formulate their drafts.\n\n\nOur Delegation members are supported by projects and DAOs like BanklessDAO, Fightclub.VC, Sismo.eth by delegating their tokens.\n\n\n[We have chosen not to take the delegation of 1inch DAO to decentralise Safe DAO delegation by allowing the delegate with the least safe delegated at a time to put forward as 1inch’s representative](https://gov.1inch.io/t/gnosis-safe-airdrop-claim/3550?u=0xbaer).\n\n\nThe DAOstewards members have been actively engaged in the Safe DAO forums and have given feedback on relevant and interesting proposals.\n\n\nCommitting to our scope of work at Safe DAO, we have tried to understand DAO’s general pain points and increased decentralisation and community member engagement [by authoring a successful proposal](https://forum.gnosis-safe.io/t/sep-x-improve-communication-in-safedao/1995).\n\n\nTrack what we are doing at Safe DAO on our [general delegation thread](https://forum.gnosis-safe.io/t/introducing-daostewards/1854)\n\n\n### Expectation\n\n\nThe delegate that receives delegation will be expected to maintain a minimum voting participation rate of 70%. They should actively participate in SAFE DAO.\n\n\n### Re-delegation\n\n\nIf a delegate falls below a minimum voting participation rate of 70% at SAFE DAO, then another representative can present a proposal for re-delegation.\n\n\n## Implementation:\n\n\nEuler would delegate SAFE tokens to Stablelab.eth, DAOplomats.eth, or leave the SAFE self-delegated to the Euler treasury wallet.\n\n\n## Voting:\n\n\nOption A: Delegate $SAFE to [StableLab](https://forum.euler.finance/t/rfc-delegate-safe-airdrop-to-stable-lab/534) via Stablelab.eth.\n\n\nOption B: Delegate $SAFE to DAOstewards via DAOstewards.eth\n\n\nOption C: Do neither and retain the $SAFE voting power\n\n\nOption D: Abstain from voting\n",

      "content": "\n\nAuthor(s): @SuperPat , @Carebbear ,@river0X )\n\nRelated Discussions: [[Ideation] Formulating the Proposal Lifecycle](https://forum.euler.finance/t/ideation-formulating-the-proposal-lifecycle/552)\n\nSubmission Date: 20 January 2023\n\n1. Simple Summary:\n\nThis proposal aims to formalise the governance processes and forum/proposal set-up to provide a clearer structure to support a more robust DAO.\n\n2. Abstract:\n\nThe proposal will first run through the proposed governance stages, then suggested proposal categories and templates (including the fast-track proposal’s special case).\n\n3. Motivation:\n\nCurrently, the governance process is known to the community as not fully standardised. There is often confusion regarding proposal categories, what information is required to include in the proposal, proposal stages and responsibilities of moving proposals through each stage.\n\nThis issue is magnified when onboarding new community members. This proposal seeks to formalise the proposal process with the community, and standardise the proposal templates before updating the information in related docs and guidelines.\n\n4. Specification/Body Text:\n\nProposal Stages\n\nCurrently, proposals have to go through “Ideation” → RFC (7 days) → eIP (7 days) → Snapshot (Off-chain, 6 days) → execution. This is six different stages, resulting in a minimum of 4-5 weeks needed for a successful proposal to be implemented, which isn’t adaptive enough to react to the fast-changing environment in DeFi.\n\nThis proposal proposes the following changes to be adopted and to shorten the default proposal lifecycle to 14 days:\n\n1. Ideation: The proposer discusses with community members and drafts the RFC proposal formally on the forum, informally in Discord or in private chats. The best place for proposal ideation is Euler Discord’s #Discussion channel under the Governance category.\n\n2. RFC (Request For Comment): The proposer drafts a proposal and publishes it on the forum for open community discussion and feedback. The proposal should include categories in the title, and follow the corresponding template (see the templates below) before publishing under either eIP/Grant Proposal/General Proposal category (see more about these categories below) with the “RFC (Request For Comment)” subcategory tag.\n\nWhen creating a proposal, the proposer should specify the start and end date of the proposal using the time and date option. The default duration for this stage is 6 days, but if the proposer feels that they did not receive enough comments or wants to extend the discussion, they may do so by adding a written comment in a reply post to the thread, with a maximum duration of an additional 7 days.\n\nThe proposal should include a poll option at the end of the proposal (see examples in the templates below) for the purpose of the community temperature check. Once the temperature check has passed (see more about temperature check below) and the community and proposal initiator have deemed enough feedback is received, it can proceed to the Formal Submission stage.\n\nFormal Submission (Rename from eIP stage): Previous RFC proposal will be re-published as a new comment under the same proposal forum thread including changes that incorporates community feedback. The proposer will also need to edit the proposal title to include a sequential number, eg. change the title from “eIP: Promote LUSD to Cross Tier” to “eIP 39: Promote LUSD to Cross Tier”, and change the proposal’s subcategory from “RFC (Request For Comment)” to “Formal Submission”.\n\n3. The formal submission stage will last for 2 days to allow a final review of the proposal and challenges. This period is extendable with the community’s or the proposer’s written request as a forum comment before it’s published on Snapshot for voting. No temperature-checking poll is needed for this stage.\n\n4. Snapshot Off-chain Voting/Live Vote: To submit a proposal on Snapshot, the proposer must have a minimum of 500 EUL delegated to them. This can be achieved through self-delegation, or by reaching out to a delegate who already has that amount delegated to them and asking them to create the proposal on their behalf. The proposal subcategory on the forum should be changed from “Formal Submission” to “Live Vote”. A forum comment should be made by the proposer under the proposal thread to announce the Snapshot vote going live with a link to the Snapshot vote attached. The Snapshot vote will last for 6 days, and the vote result will determine whether the proposal will be executed or not.\n\n5. Implementation/Voted Proposal: Successful proposals will be passed on to relevant teams for execution and there will be no further actions required for failed proposals. Once Snapshot voting ends, the proposal subcategory should be changed from “Formal Submission” to “Voted Proposal”. A forum comment should be made by the proposer under the proposal thread to announce the result of the Snapshot vote and whether further actions will be made.\n\n- A thread will be created in the main eIP category to provide updates on the status of proposals that have passed and are waiting to be implemented.This will improve the visibility and overview of all updates that are yet to be implemented.\n\n- If a proposal does not pass but still receives support from the community, it may be reintroduced no sooner than 10 days after the voting period for the original proposal has ended.\n\n- Note: Fast-track proposals will have a different lifecycle, please see the section below\n\n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreibbkw5th4t7sdi4kazz2iqycawkhfmxcqzmc4ct2tcnnrmfis5gcm)\n        \nRFC Temperature Checking Polls\n\nAn RFC Temperature Checking Poll is a poll inserted at the bottom of RFC proposals to check with the community whether the proposal has enough community interest and support before progressing to the Formal Submission stage.\n\nThe poll should always contain 3 single-choice options:\n\n- Yes, in favor of the proposal\n- No, against the proposal\n- Modify the proposal\n\nTo be considered as “passing” the temperature check, the proposal’s poll should pass the following 2 criteria: 1) gain >8 unique voters; 2) have more than 51% of total voters voting in favour of the proposal. Please be mindful that any attempts to game the temperature check will result in the immediate delisting of the proposal from the forum.\n\n\n     \n![image](ipfs://bafkreiev7hfs2kebso24evihpwrqwx2vm765btf3u7wltegnkcze3nknnm)\n    \n3 Proposal Categories\n\nThis proposal proposes 3 proposal categories: eIP (Euler Improvement Proposals), Grants Proposals and General Proposals. Each proposal will have the standardised format proposed below, which will be included in the pinned post for each category on the forum.\n\neIP – Changes in risk parameters relating to an asset, eg. borrow/collateral factors, asset tier upgrade/downgrade, or affecting the Euler protocol. [eIP Proposal Template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1unxiPz13lhzHjmoTWsXON8cbZPU1Zf2dIvEEf57v7bk/edit)\nGrant Proposal – A request for funding from the DAO for an improvement task. [Grant Proposal Template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10ejorRPGTI6deZUaMGcI76WKg4UBcahjGwyRq634WvY/edit?usp=sharing)\nGeneral – Other types of proposals, including marketing and events. [General Proposal Template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WuE1VePnun_c7J4n5yQ7keidv-_40wVqiKd7cGNAHcQ/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n![image](ipfs://bafkreifeezqlwlumiigpcdeck7twiomiaicp3g3ijwnwo2cfy2534zv3sm)\n    \nTo signal the proposal type to governance participants, the proposal categories should be included in the proposal title, for example, “eIP 39: Promote LUSD to Cross Tier”, the sequential number can be skipped at the RFC stage.\n\n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreibrroziqiml6n7bjbarvmjo4txukd2m7qoddc2fdydnhyxio6gi6m)\n    Example of publishing an eIP proposal in the RFC (Request For Comment) subcategory.\n\nThis proposal does not suggest changing the names of previous proposals. lf this proposal passes, the new naming system should only apply to future proposals and will not be retroactive.\n\nFast Track Proposal Process\n\nFast-track proposals, due to their urgent nature, require a lifecycle as short as 24 hours. A fast-track proposal does not need to go through the RFC stage, and it will be published on the forum as a live proposal and Snapshot for voting simultaneously. The voting results will be concluded after 24 hours, and successful proposals will be passed on to the relevant team for implementation.\n\n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreifubdiefsbizdglsuu4qv3kpwvkfl7o6keanjlzpp7pusvwzmlgny)\n    The proposal category of a fast track proposal should follow the 3 default categories, with “[Fast track]” included in the proposal title, for example “[Fast track] eIP 31: Move WBTC oracle to an explicit WBTC Chainlink Oracle. Here “[Fast track]” signals the urgent nature of the proposal and the application of 24h proposal lifecycle, while “eIP” means it’s an Euler Improvement Proposal related to protocol/asset parameter changes.\n\n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreiemkd5wuu6fcvfzmdwxbdkftll3kkas5qntnjrs7jz6vmb64kus5q)\n    Example of a Fast-track eIP proposal published with “Live vote” subcategories on the forum.\n\nFast-track proposals, which typically involve urgent and significant updates to the protocol, will only be able to be proposed by Euler Labs contributors until a version of the Senior Delegates program is implemented. This will be further decentralised with time.\n\nNext steps\n\nAfter a proposal is approved, the related documentation in the Gitbook will be updated. The forum categories will be reorganized and guidance will be provided for creating proposals, with templates automatically filling in when creating an RFC.\n\nPros and Cons of This Proposal\n\nPros:\n\nStandardise the governance process so it is clear for all DAO participants.\nOffer a reference point for DAO process disputes.\nEasier onboarding process for new community members.\nFurther decentralises the governance process to the community\nCons:\n\nCommunity members need to adapt new proposal process and naming system.\nIn the immediate future, it may be confusing for community members to see both the old and new naming systems existing on the forum and Snapshot.\nVoting\n\nOptions are:\n\nYES - implement the changes above\nNO - do not implement the changes above",

      "content": "Title: eIP 46:Increase default borrow factor to 0.5 from 0.28\n\nAuthor: @seraphim\n\nSubmission Date: 20 January, 2023\n\nSimple summary:\n\nPretty straightforward idea. At the moment we have little borrowing of long-tail assets because the current BF requires you to post 100 USD worth of collateral to borrow 25 USD worth of tokens. However, clearly there is demand for more.\n\nFor eg, there was lots of LDO shorting up until LDO exploded. This guy for instance was willing to short LDO at very restrictive borrow factors: https://app.euler.finance/account/0?spy=0x7d070e1ec0d5a144ea036d3f5d6c35e394de7b0a\n\nSimilarly, this account has been rather profitable in shorting FTT even at the default factor: https://app.euler.finance/account/2/?spy=0xaee2ae13ebf81d38df5a9ed7013e80ea3f72e39b\n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreibn7lf3f4rs7qc45gynsqplrsg54nqkgb4uybegthddz3erxz5fy4)\n    \nBut there could be a lot more demand for other tokens had the default been higher, which would also generate more fees for the DAO.\n\nWhen it comes to risks, the major one is liquidations. If there is no onchain liquidity, then liquidators will find it hard to buy the asset on the market to repay debts. But frankly, I don’t see how that becomes much harder from a 0.28 → 0.50 increase.\n\nThis also only increases the risk for the long-tail asset lenders, so it’s not systemic.\n\nVoting\n\nOptions are:\n\nYES - implement the changes above\n\nNO - do not implement the changes above",

      "content": "Title: eIP 43 : Allow “abstain” vote\n\nAuthors: @knightsemplar / @Raslambek\n\nSubmission Date: 13/01/23\n\nSummary\nThe current vote contract is configured to only allow “yes” or “no” votes.\nAn “abstain” option should be added.\n\nMotivation\nAs the DAO is developing, there has appeared a request from the community to introduce an “Abstain” option. This includes but not limited to:\n\neIP 18: Move all asset price oracles to Chainlink where available ahead of the Merge\neIP 38 Delegate Optimisations in Governance: 2 - Recognised Delegates\n@0xBaer suggested it in his [Ideation] Formulating the Proposal Lifecycle\nDaostewards explained why they decide to abstain for the Encode Grant Proposal\nIt is also natural, that with eIP 38 close to approval and the Recognised Delegates programme launched, RDs will face a conflict of interest when filtering and voting for the next batch of RDs. The potential risk is that RDs will vote for themselves or those who they filtered.\n\nAt the same time, given the commitment to take part in >80% of all votes, Recognised and Active Delegates are not in a position to express their abstention by not participation in the voting. In this regard, “abstention” would be a way out to both maintain high level of participation and avoid conflict of interest.\n\nIn order to avoid gamification of the Governance by using “abstain” to maintain high participation level in the voting without meaningful contribution to the discussion and decision making process, the “abstain” vote should be properly explained both on the forum and Snaphot in respect of a particular proposal\n\nSpecification & Implementation\nThe Euler Foundation would be engaged to change the voting contract to allow for “abstain” as an additional voting option.\n\nVoting\nYes, implement this change.\nNo, leave things as they are.",

      "content": "**Title**: eIP 44: Fast-track - Convert FTT reserves to ETH\n\n**Authors**: @Raslambek\n\n**Submission Date**: 18/01/23\n\n## Simple Summary\n\nThis proposal aims at converting FTT market reserves into ETH to save Protocol's assets and move them to the WETH market reserves. \n\n## Motivation\n\nFTT is a native token of the FTX crypto-currency exchange that on [11 November filed for bankruptcy](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/11/11/sam-bankman-frieds-cryptocurrency-exchange-ftx-files-for-bankruptcy.html). On November 14 the office of the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York began an investigation into FTX's collapse.\n\nSince then, the FTT price has dropped 10 times, stabilizing at around [2$ per token](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ftx-token/) for the time being. This affected the [FTT market reserves for 6,64K FTT](https://app.euler.finance/market/0x50d1c9771902476076ecfc8b2a83ad6b9355a4c9). The current value of the reserves is around $15K in comparison to $150k before FTX collapsed.\n\nUnlike other dramatic decrease in price of assets that is not unusual for the crypto industry, FTT's parent company FTX filed for bankruptcy meaning that it will cease to exist. Therefore, the FTT price will eventually go to 0.\n\nAgainst this background, although the FTT market still de facto exists, it represents an artificial gambling-like asset with no company behind it.\n\nIn this regard, it is proposed to convert accrued FTT market reserves (6,64K) to ETH with the aim to save protocol's money.\n\n\n**Yes** - Convert FTT reserves to ETH\n\n**No** - Do nothing",

Also change the IRM model to Major (same as UNI, LINK).\n \n**Motivation**\nWhile highest tier assets on Euler have risk factors reflecting their risk profile, longer-tailed assets have extremely restrictive risk factors. This makes borrowing them unviable.

      "content": "Title: Schedule rolling monthly oracle change discussions & votes\n\nAuthors: River / Raslambek\n\nRelated Discussions: N/A\n\nSubmission Date: Q1 2023\nSummary\n\nThis proposal calls for a once monthly asset oracle discussion post to be scheduled (on the first of each month) with the vote of the outcome of the discussion to be held on the first day of the final week of each month.\nMotivation\n\nCountless Uniswap V3 → Chainlink oracle posts are discussed in this forum. This is a great thing: it promotes protocol security. Nonetheless, in the interests of keeping the forum clean and engaged while always trending towards minimising governance, it would be preferable to schedule these votes to once a month.\n\nThis would have the following advantages:\n\n    It would clean the forums by reducing the number of separate posts needed\n    It would centralise discussion into one forum, ensuring that no assets are missed\n    It would reduce voter apathy by decreasing the number of votes required to take over the course of the month\n    It would ensure that other important discussions are not crowded out by these fairly repetitive (but important) proposals\n\nOf course, exemptions for fast track oracle changes can always be made. We should be proud of the perception and intelligence of our growing community in how we acted during EIP31.\nSpecification & Implementation\n\nStarting January 1st, 2023, I suggest we begin with an asset oracle post.\n\nOne week before the end of January, 2023 (i.e. the 24th of January), a vote shall be taken to move all agreed upon assets to the desired oracle.\n\nThis will be rolling monthly in February, March, April etc. and each vote will begin one week before the end of a month.\n\nI will implement these myself each month (or should I be absent have delegated it to another DAO member). A fast track exemption like EIP31 will be allowed for should the DAO deem it necessary.\nVoting\n\n    Yes, implement this rolling monthly oracle discussion and vote\n    No, keep the oracle discussions as they are\n",

      "title": "eIP 39: Promote LUSD to Cross Tier",
      "content": "Posted on behalf of TokenBrice - I am not the author\n\nTitle: eIP 39: Promote LUSD to Cross Tier\nAuthor(s): TokenBrice, Yuliyan\nSubmission Date: 12/26/2022\nSimple Summary\n\nThis proposal suggests the promotion of LUSD to cross tier: increasing borrow factor, decreasing the reserve factor, and adjusting the interest rate model accordingly.\nAbstract\n\nWhile Euler Finance is not relying as heavily on centralized stablecoins as other money markets, thanks to the very healthy ETH/stETH markets, centralized stablecoins still constitute a sizeable share of both sides of the market. Nurturing markets for resilient stablecoins like LUSD enable Euler to hedge against the centralization-related risks of other stablecoins.\n\nLUSD is already supported as collateral on Angle Money (borrow agEUR) & Mimo (borrow PAR). A promotion of LUSD to cross on Euler will pave the way for its support as collateral once supply caps are implemented. It should prove to be a serious hedge facilitating the attraction of a critical mass of LUSD to the supply side of the Euler market, enabling further growth.\n\nIf Euler Finance can attract a decent supply of LUSD, then further integrations could be considered, such as the support of Chicken Bonds’ bLUSD to enable bLUSD holders to leverage their positions.\nMotivation\nRisk Assessment\n\nLUSD is the stablecoin outputted by the Liquity Protocol, run entirely by immutable code, just like Uniswap. This characteristic dramatically reduces the scope of risk, as it eliminates any possibility of a governance attack. Since Liquity only accepts ETH for collateral, the risk scope on that front is also immensely reduced.\n\nThere are currently around 345K ETH in Liquity Troves, backing 182.5M LUSD of debt (=total supply).\n\nWhat’s left are primarily technical and economic risks, which are addressed through all relevant means. The protocol was audited multiple times, and features the top DeFiSafety score, demonstrating very careful development practices.\n\nFinally, the oracle risk for Euler is also reasonable since the LUSD market is already using a ChainLink-based price feed.\nMarket Data\n\nimage\nimage1808×791 80.9 KB\n\nOn mainnet, LUSD is mostly traded on Curve and Uniswap:\n\n    On Curve, the LUSD / 3pool (USDT/USDC/DAI) is the main liquidity source with $~50M TVL, with another ~$4M TVL pool LUSD / FRAXbp (FRAX/USDC).\n    On Uniswap, the LUSD / USDC 5bps pool is the main liquidity source with ~3M TVL and LUSD / DAI 5bps pool with ~$1M TVL.\n    There is also an LUSD/wETH/LQTY tripool growing on Balancer with $550k TVL.\n\nVolume-wise, LUSD sees some volatility depending on the ETH price movements, with an average of around ~$3M daily. Thanks to the available liquidity, 5M LUSD can be easily settled instantly to another stablecoin with minimal (<1%) slippage:\n\nimage\nimage1808×1077 134 KB\n\nLUSD also has healthy markets on Optimism, with various stablecoin pairings (sUSD, USDC, MAI, USD+) and LUSD/wETH.\nBackground\n\nLUSD has been added on Euler Finance as an isolated asset. With the addition of the EUL gauge votes, LUSD received a neat support ranking #9 on the latest round. The LUSD market now has a 1.23M LUSD supply with about 50% utilization rate.\n\nNext to Euler, the main money market supporting LUSD is Aave, where LUSD can be borrowed. Aave has 1.6M LUSD supplied with 73% utilization rate.\nReferences\n\n    Website\n    Whitepaper\n    Documentation\n    GitHub Page\n    Dune Analytics\n    Security Audits\n    Twitter\n    Discord\n    YouTube\n\nSpecification and Implementation\n\n    Promote LUSD to Cross Tier\n    Increase Borrow Factor from 0.28 to 0.70\n    Decrease LUSD Reserve Factor from 0.23 to 0.15\n    Adjust LUSD Interest Rate Model (same as USDC)\n        Base IR unchanged (0.00)\n        Lower Kink IR from 10.00 to 4.00\n        Lower Max IR from 300.00 to 100.00\n\nVoting\n\nIf the community response to this RFC is positive and this proposal moves to a vote, a Yes vote would entail support for raising LUSD to Cross tier and adjusting its parameter, while a No would keep the same as current (Isolated tier).\nAdditional Context on Liquity\n\nLiquity is a decentralized borrowing protocol that allows you to draw 0% interest loans against ETH as collateral with only a 0.5% one-time initial fee. Loans are paid out in LUSD, a USD-pegged stablecoin.\n\nBorrowing with Liquity is extremely capital-efficient, with a collateral ratio of only 110%. In addition to the collateral, the loans are secured by a Stability Pool containing LUSD and by other borrowers who collectively act as guarantees of last resort. Users borrowing against their ETH use decentralized 3rd party front ends.\n\nLUSD has proved its impeccable resilience by flawlessly going through several severe market crashes. - 5/19/21 ETH Crash - How Liquity Handled its First Big Stress Test\n\nimage\nimage2456×999 143 KB\n\nLiquity as a protocol is non-custodial, immutable, and governance-free. And LUSD is a stablecoin capable of resisting all kinds of censorship. No person or organization has any control over the protocol — it is “set in stone” in smart contract code and can never be altered in any way.\n\nThe Liquity protocol was launched on the 5th of April, 2021. As the code is immutable, there has been no update since then. The Liquity team has recently launched Chicken Bonds. It offers an amplified yield-earning and trading opportunity for LUSD holders while helping to reduce the stablecoin premium and improve its liquidity.",

      "title": " eIP 38 Delegate Optimisations in Governance: 2 - Recognised Delegates",
      "content": " **Author(s)**: [@SuperPat](https://forum.euler.finance/u/superpat)\n\n**Related Discussions**: [eIP 32: Delegate Optimisations in Governance 1](https://snapshot.org/#/eulerdao.eth/proposal/0x9da517e2a16214570748cc1e91adc4c9387bf25993c565e54376bc96e56559dd)\n\nRFC discussion: RFC: [Delegate Optimisations in Governance: 2 - Recognised Delegates 1](https://forum.euler.finance/t/rfc-delegate-optimisations-in-governance-2-recognised-delegates/547)\n\n**Submission Date**: 22 December, 2022\n\n###### 1. Simple Summary:\nThe proposal aims at gaining community support for launching the Recognised Delegates Programme as an addition to the existing DAO delegates structure. The Recognised Delegates Programme will introduce a reputation system to the delegates system, giving outstanding DAO participants recognition thus motivating them and other community members to promptly participate in the governance of the protocol.\n\n###### 2. Abstract:\nDisclosure: I am the Ecosystem & Community Lead at Euler Labs. However, the following comments and views are my own and do not represent the positions of any affiliated organisations.\n\nDAOs as a new form of social organisation are heavily reliant on reputation, Recognised Delegates Programme represents recognition to those who added the most value to the DAO with elevated status/title, special discord roles, and front-end changes prioritising recognised delegates.\n\n###### 3. Motivation:\nEuler governance has seen continuous growing participation among community members, though we have to recognise that the delegate system hasn’t fully released its potential. The delegation system has walked towards a better structure with the recently passed [Active Delegates Programme](https://snapshot.org/#/eulerdao.eth/proposal/0x9da517e2a16214570748cc1e91adc4c9387bf25993c565e54376bc96e56559dd) which gives active DAO participants more exposure and recognition, this proposal would like to further improve the system by giving more acknowledgement based on value-added.\n\n###### 4. Specification/Body Text:\n\n###### The Status Quo – Attempts to Establish Structure in the DAO\n\nCurrently, there are only two tiers of delegates: Public Delegates and Active Delegates. Anyone who submits the application can have a public profile on the delegates page to decentralise the process. Any public delegate that has passed a minimum level of voting participation automatically becomes an Active Delegate (see: [eIP 32: Delegate Optimisations in Governance 1](https://snapshot.org/#/eulerdao.eth/proposal/0x9da517e2a16214570748cc1e91adc4c9387bf25993c565e54376bc96e56559dd)). There are no assessments or rewards for the active community members that have made extra contributions to the DAO, it is difficult for community members looking to delegate their votes to have an insight into the members that added the most value to the community and delegate their voting power accordingly.\n\n###### What is a Recognised Delegate\n\nA recognised delegate is an elected, paid post of reputable, diligent and qualified Euler DAO members who will work closely with the team and contribute to the protocol. They are respected members of the DAO and recommended public delegates.\n\n###### Criteria of a Recognised Delegate\n\n###### Reputable\n\n+ You have a good reputation in the space & good relationship with the community\n###### Active\n\n+ You have to maintain >80% of overall voting participation in the 3-month period prior to Recognised Delegates Application\n+ You attach short explanations to all of your votes in Snapshot\n+ You actively contribute to the DAO and participate in community discussions\n\n###### Qualified\n\n+ You are qualified in your preferred area of contribution, for example, if it involves technical know-how and risk management\n\n###### How to Become a Recognised Delegate\n\nA quarterly community vote will be conducted to decide the remaining/leaving/election of Recognised Delegates\n\n###### Process:\n\n1. Community members & existing Recognised Delegates submit applications\n+ Only applicants with >80% overall voting participation rates in the prior 3-month period will be qualified\n+ Only applicants with >600 EUL token delegated will be qualified\n2. Existing Recognised Delegates** review the application to gatekeep & filter the low-quality applications, all applications & decisions will be made public for maximum transparency\n3. Existing Delegate prepares for the quarterly community vote with:\n+ Activity statistics for the existing Recognised Delegates in the past 3 months\n+ Applications of the Recognised Delegates Programme\n4. Quarterly community Snapshot vote for the top 10 members to be the Recognised Delegates of the next quarter:\n+ For an existing Recognised Delegate to remain in the post (by voting for them)\n+ For an existing Recognised Delegate to leave the post (by NOT voting for them)\n+ For a delegate to become a Recognised Delegate (by voting for them)\n\n###### Implementation Set up:\n\n1. ** Recommend setting up a recognised delegates committee consisting of [@SuperPat](https://forum.euler.finance/u/superpat), [@Matija](https://forum.euler.finance/u/matija), [@river0x](https://forum.euler.finance/u/river0x), [@Raslambek](https://forum.euler.finance/u/raslambek), [@knightsemplar](https://forum.euler.finance/u/knightsemplar) to conduct filtering of the first batch of incoming applications and post the first quarterly community proposal\n2. Changes on the front-end\n+ Pin the Recognised Delegates application at the top of the Delegates page, before Active Delegates\n+ Grant check-marks next to their delegate profile name\n3. Coordinape set-up without a budget to assess the contribution of each recognised delegate on a monthly basis, published and made visible to community members\n4. Recommend a distribution of governance tokens of 200 EUL per recognised delegates per month. Recognised Delegates whose voting participation rate fell below 80%/fail to attach explanations to their votes in any of the months during term period will be disqualified from receiving governance token of that month.\n###### Pros:\n\n1. It recognises and rewards community members who add a lot of value to the DAO.\n2. It establishes examples for other community members and motivates them to actively participate and contribute\n3. It gives the community visibility of top contributors’ contributions and allocates their votes accordingly.\n###### Cons:\n\n1. It could entrench and centralise governance around existing participants.\n2. The criteria for being a recognised delegate may be too harsh which can effectively decrease their motivation\n###### 5. Next steps\n\n1. The community should discuss the idea of the Recognised Delegates Programme and assess its value to the DAO\n2. The community should discuss the proposed criteria and other implementation details to see if they are effective to achieve the goals\nRelevant Links:\n\n+ Previous discussion related to delegates structure change – [eIP 32: Delegate Optimisations in Governance 1](https://snapshot.org/#/eulerdao.eth/proposal/0x9da517e2a16214570748cc1e91adc4c9387bf25993c565e54376bc96e56559dd)\n\n+ RFC discussion: [RFC: Delegate Optimisations in Governance: 2 - Recognised Delegates 1](https://forum.euler.finance/t/rfc-delegate-optimisations-in-governance-2-recognised-delegates/547)",

      "content": "\n**Author(s)**:  @encodeclub \n\n**Related Discussions:** [RFC & temp check poll](https://forum.euler.finance/t/rfc-encode-club-grant-proposal/538)\n\n**Submission Date:** December 8, 2022\n\n **Simple Summary**:\n\nEncode suggests to receive $30K USD from Euler and allocate to grant projects as it sees fit, whilst engaging, consulting and involving the community in decisions.\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nEncode Club will organise **a pilot grants programme** that will aim to familiarise their community with the Euler DAO's bounties. Their team will be entrusted with their promotion and furthermore tasked with evaluation of the best projects submissions, making sure that each is up to the standards set by the DAO.\n\nThe programme will closely resemble the previously successful \"Bounties4Bandits\" grants that Encode ran for Saddle. A summary of its execution and results can be found [here](https://medium.com/encode-club/bounties4bandits-the-bandits-have-saddled-up-39c2ae45f676).\n\nEncode Club is a web3 education community. We help people learn, build and launch their web3 careers. We do this through high quality events such as educate series, hackathons, accelerators and bootcamps. 1000s graduate from Encode programmes each month with many getting jobs and starting companies (Euler itself [won an Encode hackathon](https://medium.com/encode-club/spark-university-hackathon-summary-and-winners-3c5e5a743b12)).\n\n**Motivation:**\n\nEncode Club will crowdsource ideas for bounties from the community and will decide what bounty size to allocate for each. Each of the bounties should consist of:\n\n1. Brief summary and explanation\n\n2. Clearly outlined deliverables\n\n3. Execution and delivery within the timeline of the programme\n\n4. Amount of funding attached\n\nThere will be two types of bounties:\n\n1. Competitions -> several projects compete and the best gets the bounty award at the end of the programme.\n\n2. Award -> a single team is selected to answer the bounty, and receives the award upon completion by the end of the programme.\n\nBounties will be listed on the Encode website and a public call for participants will be made. Encode Club will take care of promoting and marketing the initiative as well as organise several education events with community members and investors from the Euler community throughout the bounty period.\n\nTeams then build by the deadline and the best are given bounties as judged by Encode, with a show and tell finale. The total value of the funds distributed by EncodeClub is $30K USD. For the pilot, Encode will not charge any operational fee and run the programme pro bono for the benefit of the Euler ecosystem.\n\nIf the programme proves successful, Encode would iterate and apply again from Q2 2023 for a follow up grants programme and will charge its standard operational fee at the time.\n\n",

      "content": "**Author**: [@Matt_StableNode](https://forum.euler.finance/u/matt_stablenode), Bobbay_StableNode\n**Related Discussions**: \n[Related SAFE Airdrop Discussion](https://forum.euler.finance/t/rfc-safe-airdrop-claim-and-delegation/496/15),\n[[RFC] Delegate SAFE Airdrop to Stable Lab](https://forum.euler.finance/t/rfc-delegate-safe-airdrop-to-stable-lab/534), \n**Submission Date:** December 14, 2022\n\n## Summary:\nSafe DAO (formerly Gnosis Safe) [airdropped](https://forum.gnosis-safe.io/t/proposal-safe-distribution-for-users/369) their new $SAFE token to users of their multi-sig safes. Euler must claim their airdrop and delegate to an external wallet by December 27th, 2022. This proposal aims to claim the airdrop before the deadline and self-delegate the $SAFE tokens via the multi-sig before deciding on a future delegate.\n\n## Abstract:\nEuler uses a [SAFE multi-sig](https://docs.euler.finance/euler-governance/treasury) smart contract wallet to hold treasury assets. This made Euler eligible to receive 7,972.59 SAFE tokens. These tokens give holders voting power in SafeDAO. This will allow Euler to have a say in Safe Governance and help to ensure the protocol moves in a positive direction, keeping the Euler treasury safe. This proposal aims to first claim the airdrop before deciding on a delegate.\n\n## Motivation:\nIt is beneficial for Euler to participate in SafeDAO to make sure Safe remains a good tool to use to keep the Euler treasury in. \nSince multiple delegates are vying for the SAFE delegation, the format of this proposal allows the Euler community to first claim the airdrop before deciding which delegate they want to delegate to. This will ensure Euler is able to claim before the deadline. \n\n## Specification & Implementation:\nTo implement this Euler would claim and self-delegate the $SAFE tokens via the multi-sig.\n \n## Voting:\nOption A: Euler claims and self-delegates the $SAFE tokens via the multi-sig\nOption B: Euler does not claim SAFE airdrop\n \n",

      "content": "Title: eIP 36 Fast track - Module updates\nAuthor: Carebear\nRelated Discussions: N/A\n\nSubmission Date: 12 December 2022\nSummary\n\nEuler’s permissionless nature has left a small edge-case contract bug that I propose to empower the Euler Foundation to rectify, and to do so in a fast-track way.\nAbstract\n\nA bug in reserve accrual has been discovered in the Euler contracts. No customer funds or protocol reserves are at risk, but users who have RAD assets or liabilities are temporarily unable to use their accounts, and they are temporarily unable to be liquidated.\nMotivation\n\nEuler should operate as intended, and this bug can be easily fixed hence I suggest the DAO fast tracks this proposal.\nSpecification\n\nThe contracts are coded to gracefully handle extremely large supplies or borrows, for example if a token has flash mint support, or is a malicious token with a gigantic supply. However, if the reserves grow to a certain level on a market, newly accrued interest cannot be stored and this causes updating the market’s asset information to fail.\n\nFortunately, the contracts can be upgraded to apply the same protection done for supply and borrow amounts to the reserves. In the case of reserve overflow, no new reserves will accrue to the market. However, loading it will continue to succeed and – critically – liquidations of users can still be processed.\n\nThis bug was noticed because a user made a large mint on the RAD pool. RAD is currently configured with a very poor quality oracle, which means that an extremely large amount of RAD could be minted with a small amount of additional collateral.\n\nThese large nominal values can cause off-chain reporting metrics to be comically wrong. We’re calling these values nominal since 0 actual RAD was involved. Note that the actual cause of the wrong numbers is a bad oracle, and this has happened with regular deposits and/or borrows as well. The large mint worked as expected, except for uncovering the bug in the reserves accrual mechanism mentioned above.\nImplementation\n\nThis vote will empower the Euler Foundation to do two things:\n\n    As a short-term fix, make a contract fix to the RAD market, deploy the Governance module, and set reserve factor to 0\n    Upgrade all other modules in a slower, more methodical way to ensure this does not happen to other assets\n\nVoting\n\nVoting will last 24h if approved by the discord governance section\n\nYes: empower the Euler foundation to make these two changes ASAP\nNo: do not make the change",

      "title": "eIP 34: Change OHM oracle to Chainlink and set up market parameters",
      "content": "Title: Change OHM oracle to Chainlink and set up market parameters\nAuthors: Felix\nRelated Discussions: https://forum.euler.finance/t/rfc-change-ohm-oracle-to-chainlink-and-set-up-market-parameters/512\nSubmission Date: 29/11/2022\nSummary\nThis proposal calls for 1) changing the OHM price oracle to Chainlink, and 2) setting up the OHM market parameters to include a borrowFactor of 0.5 and a Base IR% of 5.00%.\nMotivation\n\nOracle\nAt the moment, the existing OHM Uniswap price oracle does not facilitate the creation of an OHM market since there are no major trading pairs there. Olympus would like to list an OHM market on Euler, and as a first step to doing that we propose to change the OHM price oracle to Chainlink. This OHM/ETH Chainlink oracle can be found here and is already used in various DeFi applications today.\n\nborrowFactor\nAt the same time, and after consultation with the Euler team, we propose to set the borrowFactor to 0.5, allowing for more efficient lending and borrowing activities in this market. Below we outline our reasons why - considering the market liquidity and price volatility - we think this is a relatively low risk change for the protocol.\n\nToday the majority of OHM liquidity can be found on Balancer 1, with smaller pools on Curve and Fraxswap. Most of the TVL in these pools is protocol owned (roughly $60m at the time of writing), and so there is no risk of liquidity suddenly disappearing during market volatility. As such, liquidators can be guaranteed that there is sufficient depth to liquidate into and as previous experiences with for example Rari have shown, these protocol-owned pools allow for safe unwinding of debt (in the case of Rari, hundreds of millions were liquidated without any bad debt).\n\nWith the maturation of the Olympus protocol, the focus has shifted to fostering stability over the last year. The high staking rates that defined the protocol’s past have been significantly reduced, buttressing stability and removing a major hurdle for the use of OHM throughout DeFi. More importantly, Olympus has deployed an algorithmic open market operations module (“Range-Bound Stability”), fostering the stability of OHM around a floating target price. In short, RBS codifies the protocol’s “bond” policy, expanding supply by selling OHM (growing reserves) during periods of high demand and contracting supply by acquiring OHM (drawing down reserves) during periods of lower demand. For more information on RBS, please visit the following link.\n\nAs a result of these changes, the OHM price volatility has been significantly reduced. More importantly for setting the borrowFactor though, is that any sudden price increase or decrease will be heavily dampened through these algorithmic market operations that strive to keep the OHM price in a certain range.\n\nAs such, with the guarantee of permanent liquidity and a low expected volatility, we feel that setting the borrowFactor to 0.5 is a relatively low risk change for the protocol that will make the market much more attractive for third parties to participate in.\n\nInterest rates\nFinally, we propose to set the Base IR% of the market to 5.00%. Due to the nature of the OHM staking/rebasing mechanism we want to avoid a situation in which borrowers are able to pay an interest rate (significantly) below the reward rate. At the same time, lenders will not be incentivized to lend out funds if the interest rate is below the base reward rate.\n\nShould this proposal pass we plan to deposit protocol-owned OHM to seed the supply side of the market (pending Olympus governance vote).\nSpecification & Implementation\n\n    Update the OHM market’s price oracle to the Chainlink OHM/ETH oracle found here.\n    Set the borrowFactor of the OHM market to 0.5.\n    Change the interest rate model of the OHM market to the following:\n\nBase IR % \tKink IR % \tMax IR % \tKink %\n5.00 \t20.00 \t300.00 \t0.80\nVoting\n\n    Yes, change the OHM price oracle to Chainlink and set the borrowFactor and interest rate model as outlined above.\n    No, keep the oracle and market parameters as is.\n",

      "content": "**Title**: SAFE Airdrop Claim and Delegation\n**Author**: 0xBaer for DAOplomats & Bankless DAOstewards\n**Related Discussions**: [  [ [RFC]: SAFE Airdrop Claim and Delegation ](https://forum.euler.finance/t/rfc-safe-airdrop-claim-and-delegation/496)] \n\n**Submission Date**: 06 December 2022 \n\n## Summary\n\nClaim the $SAFE token as part of the Safe DAO launch and delegate it to {DAOplomats.eth}\n\n## Abstract\n\nSafe (previously Gnosis Safe) distributes governance powers to historical users as part of the Safe DAO launch. The Euler Community treasury has claims to 7.972,59 SAFE tokens, of which 3819.38 will be vested over four years. The DAO has to delegate an external wallet to claim the Airdrop before the expiry (27.12.2022). This proposal suggests claiming the $SAFE token and delegating it to {DAOplomats.eth}\n\n## Motivation\n\nSafe is one of the essential tools of the web3 ecosystem, as most DAOs have built their treasury with Safe smart contracts. The safe is also positioned itself to introduce new smart wallet standards to the EVM ecosystem if the platform harnesses its full potential. As Euler DAO uses Gnosis safes as a fundamental on-chain component, it is in the best interest of the DAO to claim these tokens before the deadline at the end of December. Furthermore, SAFE tokens will diversify Euler DAO treasury and underline the value alignment of the two protocols. As mentioned in the Abstract, The multisig should delegate the voting power of the tokens to an external wallet during the claiming process. Since Euler DAO only has a claim to 7.972,59 SAFE, we believe the DAO should not allocate extra resources for an official DAO Diplomat (DAOplomat); instead, Voting power should be delegated to external delegates such as DAOplomats.eth. More about this decision in the ‘Rationale’.\n\n## Rationale\n\nDAOplomats have brainstormed different ways to approach the delegation of the voting power. During the Brainstorming, three main possible options arose.\n\n1. Delegating the Voting power directly to a governance group in Euler DAO\n\nTo exert the maximum influence of Euler DAO in Safe governance, We have to send an official delegation from the Euler DAO. This group should have resources to interact with the Safe DAO governance. Since Euler DAO only has minimal voting power and has to spare resources during its development stage, it would be best to look into different options.\n\n2. Delegate it to extern third parties\n\nSafe Dao currently has more than 75 guardians who have some verified contributions to the Safe DAO. They have voluntarily signed up as delegates who would act in their own best interest or Safe DAO; Euler DAO will have a minimal impact on the SafeDAO governance voting.\n\n3. Delegate to an Euler DAO value-aligned group.\n\nDelegate to Bankless [DAOplomats](http://DAOplomats.org).\nWe are official delegates from the Bankless DAO, which is mandated to govern with a net positive engagement. Since we are also delegates at EulerDAO, it is in our best interest to uphold the values and ensure maximum accountability. Euler DAO can leverage the collective voting power of BanklessDAO, Fightclub.vc and other partner DAOs in SafeDAO governance.\n\n## Specification\n\n**Introducing [DAOplomats.eth ](http://twitter.com/DAOplomats)**\n\nDAOplomats.eth are decentralised governance experts from BanklessDAO who specialise in solving the DAO governance trilemma (Voter Apathy, ignorant voting, and plutocratic voting). We tend to represent DAOs and individual token holders and provide them with an avenue to discuss proposals and leverage the combined effects of the community.\n\nWe recently joined the Euler DAO as a professional delegate group to help DAOs evolve together. [Check our internal  action plan  for Euler DAO](https://forum.euler.finance/t/daostewards-general-delegation-thread/524) \n\nWe are currently the biggest delegates in 1inch DAO and have active delegations in Optimism and SafeDAO.\n\n**Our Mission and vision**\n\n**Net positive engagement**: We represent a community aiming to empower all parties involved and develop in a positive-sum manner.\n\n**United we stand**: We, DAOstewards, believe decentralisation is paramount in governing web3. We aim to represent everyday users of web3 and have their unheard voices heard.\n\n**Bankless Lifestyle**: As a group from BanklessDAO, we aim to enable more people to exit their reliability on legacy institutions and fully embrace internet-native digital organisations.\n\n**Quality participation**: We believe the quality active contributors could help a DAO evolve. We aim to deliver the best quality of work with minimum bureaucracy.\n\n**Current safe delegation**\n\nBankless DAOsteward, the public-good arm of this initiative, runs the current DAOplomats Safe delegation. The DAOstewards specialise in governing public-good protocols.\n\n**Current members**: JengaJojo.eth, Senad.eth, Thinkdecade.eth, Gurad.eth and Links: Advisor: 0xBaer.eth\n\n**Members who are delegates on Euler**: 0xBaer.eth, JengaJojo.eth and Senad.eth\n\n[Our voting history ](https://www.notion.so/bankless/4745815f9c384338a16289251e29d833?v=a8502bef659b41d6ae2e369eebd126a2)\n\n## Implementation\n\n* Create a multisig transaction to claim the SAFE tokens if this proposal passes.\n* Delegate the $SAFE tokens to DAOplomats.eth\n\n## Voting\n\nVoting **YES** signals approval of claiming Safe tokens and delegating to [DAOplomats.eth](http://DAOplomats.org)\n\nVoting **NO**  signals disagreement of claiming Safe tokens and delegating to [DAOplomats.eth](http://DAOplomats.org)\n\n",

      "content": "\n    Title: eIP32: Delegate Optimisations in Governance 1\n    Author(s): river0x\n    Related Discussions: RFC: Delegate Optimisations in Governance: 1 1\n    Submission Date: 5th December, 2022\n\nSimple Summary\n\nI propose, with the approval of the DAO, to automatically segregate delegates based on participation. This will increase participation in governance by rewarding the most active delegates and mean greater representation in decisions reached.\n\nThe criteria agreed on are:\n\n    60% participation\n    600 EUL delegated\n    Comments next to each and every vote\n\nAbstract\n\nDisclaimer: I am a senior researcher at Euler Labs. However, the following comments and views are my own and do not represent the positions of any affiliated organisations.\n\nNevertheless, there is a growing problem among some delegates. Many have a sizable EUL delegation, and yet contribute very little, if anything, to the governance of the protocol. By my estimates (taken from app.euler.finance/delegates), some 30K EUL is currently delegated to delegates that do not vote / contribute.\nMotivation\n\nThis is problematic because contentious votes like EIP24 do not have the full weight of the community behind them: voices remain unheard. So long as delegations continue to inactive delegates, some voting power remains unused.\n\nI propose the splitting of delegates into two groups: Active Delegates and Public Delegates. This is the first step in my DOG (Delegate Optimization in Governance) plan, which ultimately aims to codify the lifecycle of a proposal, though more on this later.\nSpecification\n\nMy proposed solution is to classify delegates into two tiers (for now):\n\n    Public delegates (no change required)\n    Active delegates (details mostly worked out, implementation is purely on the front end)\n\nPublic delegates will remain as they are. They will remain on the front end for EUL holders to potentially delegate to them under app.euler.finance/delegates.\n\nActive delegates are delegates that meet the following criteria (provisional, please give your thoughts):\n\n    The delegate votes on at least 60% of Snapshot votes in any given month\n    The delegate must give a comment on Snapshot as to why they have voted this way. See the following image for context.\n    The delegates must have no fewer than 600 EUL delegated to them. This is to prevent people with 1 EUL spamming the status. This number has been agreed on by the DAO and can be revised later (alongside all numbers)\n\nSee the following for a mockup as to how this might look. Please note the proposed delegate profiles are merely suggestions and not representative of the end result.\n\nAs for enforcement, it can be verified automatically by scraping on-chain data. There are no changes required to the existing governance system: this proposition is merely cosmetic.\nFurther considerations\n\nImplementation might take a short while. I suggest we wait 1 month from the point of the vote passing in order to provide everyone an equal chance to become an Active Delegate.\n\nA pardon system could be implemented for Active Delegates who are temporarily AFK but do wish to remain an Active Delegate. My suggestion is an Active Delegate can be placed into this “Pardon Zone” for the number of months they’ve been active as a delegate but in weeks (e.g. 6 months = 6 weeks) to a maximum of 8 weeks.\nVoting\n\nYes: engage the Euler Foundation to implement this front end change\n\nNo: do not implement this change",

The current oracle prices wBTC as BTC, which does not reflect the risk of wBTC trading at some other price (as sometimes happens with derivative assets).  \n\nAbstract: \nAt the moment, the protocol prices WBTC as BTC. This is incorrect, and should be updated. Indeed, an existing eIP (28) already touched on this issue but given the current situation I propose the DAO updates this contract sooner. This is solely out of an abundance of caution and this eIP stands to mitigate a risk solely presented to Euler at this time. \n\nMotivation: \nThis will update the protocol to price WBTC as WBTC, as opposed to its current configuration. While this requires some work and overriding of an existing structure, it costs the DAO little to nothing to be cautious here and so I suggest we move forward with this update. \n\nSpecification & Implementation: \nThe oracle has already been deployed. If this proposal passes, the WBTC oracle on Euler will be updated to this price oracle. \nGiven the time sensitivity of this issue, I proposed to the DAO that we make this vote a 24h vote and received 19 votes in favour of this and 0 against this petition. I am submitting this snapshot vote now. \nIf passed, The Euler Foundation will execute this EIP and WBTC on Euler will be priced as WBTC, as opposed to BTC.\nPlease note, this does not affect any other asset in EIP 30. All other assets will still be subject to the existing voting period & will be implemented (or otherwise) based on that outcome. \n\nVoting: \nYes - move WBTC to the explicit WBTC Chainlink oracle. This is to be implemented by the 3PM EST, on the 25th of November. This is because it is a fast-track vote that has been approved and discussed as per the DAO. \n\nNo - leave the WBTC oracle as is.\n",

      "content": "\nAuthors: SNX Ambassadors\n\nRelated Discussions: This proposal follows the RFC [here](https://forum.euler.finance/t/rfc-change-susd-pricing-oracle-to-chainlink/480)\n\n\nSubmission Date: 21st / Nov / 2022\n\n## Simple Summary\n\nThis proposal calls for changing the price feed for several markets to Chainlink. It is submitted by Millie, a member of the Synthetix Ambassadors.\n\n## Abstract\n\nIntroduce the following ChainLink Oracles for these markets:\n\n* [RLC](https://data.chain.link/ethereum/mainnet/crypto-eth/rlc-eth)\n* [XCN](https://data.chain.link/ethereum/mainnet/crypto-usd/xcn-usd)\n* [ALCX](https://data.chain.link/ethereum/mainnet/crypto-usd/alcx-usd)\n* [BAL](https://data.chain.link/ethereum/mainnet/crypto-usd/bal-usd)\n* [sUSD](https://data.chain.link/ethereum/mainnet/stablecoins/susd-usd)\n* [GUSD](https://data.chain.link/ethereum/mainnet/stablecoins/gusd-usd)\n* [CRV](https://data.chain.link/ethereum/mainnet/crypto-usd/crv-usd)\n* [BUSD](https://data.chain.link/ethereum/mainnet/stablecoins/busd-usd)\n* [LRC](https://data.chain.link/ethereum/mainnet/crypto-eth/lrc-eth)\n* WBTC/ETH (this Oracle will use a custom contract to retrieve the WBTC price based on the addition of [WBTC/BTC](https://data.chain.link/ethereum/mainnet/crypto-other/wbtc-btc) ChainLink Oracle and the existing [BTC/ETH ](https://data.chain.link/ethereum/mainnet/crypto-eth/btc-eth)oracle)\n\n## Motivation\n\nUpgrading the price feed of the above mentioned markets to ChainLink - from the current UniswapV3 TWAP oracles - will ensure that the security of these markets will be of the highest standard and will enable healthy lending and borrowing.\n\nGiven that there are Chainlink feeds available for those markets, it’s in the best interest of Euler Protocol to upgrade them from the current oracles. Their current oracle ratings range from reliable to somewhat reliable to unreliable in some instances, because of the poor liquidity in many of their ETH pairs on Uniswap V3. In some cases the main liquidity source for the assets isn't even on Uniswap but rather on Curve (BUSD, sUSD, GUSD, CRV).\n\nIntroducing ChainLink oracles for LRC, RLC, XCN, ALCX, BAL, sUSD, GUSD, CRV, BUSD and WBTC will increase Euler security and allow for more efficient lending/borrowing practices for those markets.\n\n## Specification & Implementation:\n\nUpgrade the price feed of the mentioned assets in this eIP to ChainLink using the available oracles in [ChainLink’s Data Feeds](https://data.chain.link/ethereum/mainnet).\n\nThis oracle alternative was made possible by the recently passed[ eIP 14](https://forum.euler.finance/t/eip-14-contract-upgrades/305#governance-5) and the implementation is similar to that called for in[ eIP 16](https://forum.euler.finance/t/eip-16-change-steth-pricing-to-chainlink-and-amend-the-interest-rate-model/347).\n\n## Voting:\n\n* Yes – Change the above markets to Chainlink oracles\n* No – the above markets should find an alternative oracle.\n\n",

      "title": "eIP 29: Incentivize Euler Boosted Pool on Balancer",
      "content": "### Introduction\n\nHello! I’m Solarcurve and I’m part of a group called the [Balancer Maxis](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-74-fund-the-balancer-maxis-for-q4-2022/3747) who currently lead partnership integrations for the Balancer Protocol. I believe Euler is a prime candidate to take advantage of Balancer’s boosted pool technology. A boosted pool means most of a liquidity pool’s assets are sent off to earn extra yield for liquidity providers - in this case, deposited to Euler.\n\nOur flagship [Aave boosted stable pool ](https://app.balancer.fi/#/ethereum/pool/0xa13a9247ea42d743238089903570127dda72fe4400000000000000000000035d) has been live for nearly a year and has ~$120M TVL. It only has a boosted yield of 0.95% because the deposit rates on Aave are fairly low. Euler has significantly higher deposit rates which will help attract even more TVL. As TVL increases in a boosted pool the boosted yield goes UP because a higher percentage of the pool’s assets will be deposited to Euler. Only a certain amount of tokens need to remain available for trading, perhaps 500k - 1.5M.\n\n### Motivation\n\nThe Euler community has recently begun to consider incentivizing the lending side to increase TVL and further decentralize the distribution of EUL. I’d like to suggest using EUL to incentivize voters (“bribe”) to direct BAL & AURA emissions towards a Euler boosted pool instead. Why is this better than simply having lenders earn EUL directly?\n\n* The [ROI for voter incentives ](https://llama.airforce/#/bribes/overview/hh/aura-bal) is consistently around 2:1 in the last couple of months. You get $2 of BAL & AURA emissions for every $1 of EUL spent\n* Balancer will return earned protocol fees as additional voting incentives. This means even after you stop spending EUL your pool(s) will continue to see emissions directed towards them.\n\nBalancer applies our 50% protocol fee to swaps and yield. With Euler’s high deposit APR’s your pool would likely generate significantly more protocol fees than our Aave boosted stable pool. These earned protocol fees being returned as additional voting incentives into the 2:1 ROI mentioned above will help create a strong tailwind to growing the pool’s TVL.\n\n### Specification\n\nIn terms of what’s required to make this a reality, Balancer is finishing development of generalized boosted pool support on our UI later this month. We also need to create the underlying boosted pool infrastructure to support Euler which is fairly simple to do and can be completed in less than a week. Note that if we need to account for staking the deposited Euler assets into another staking contract to earn EUL this could increase development time & effort significantly.\n\nBeyond that, some amount of EUL should be allocated weekly to bribe on [Aura’s Hidden Hand](https://hiddenhand.finance/aura) market (better efficiency than Balancer’s). For comparison’s sake Rocket Pool has been allocating ~3.2k RPL every two weeks which is ~$68k in the most recent round. Balancer added an additional ~$30k on top from earned protocol fees. The rETH/weth pool has a total [yield on Aura ](https://app.aura.finance/#/) of ~9% APR with [$63M TVL](https://app.balancer.fi/#/ethereum/pool/0x1e19cf2d73a72ef1332c882f20534b6519be0276000200000000000000000112). The Aave boosted stable pool as an APR of ~4.1% on Aura. It’s likely a Euler boosted stable pool would land in a similar APR range.\n\n### Summary\n\nI propose the creation of a Euler boosted USDC/DAI/USDT pool that is allocated 5,000 EUL as voting incentives every two weeks. This would run for a trial period of three months, after which the results can be evaluated by the Euler community and an extension can be considered. Tentative start date would be early December.\n\nTotal spend: 30,000 EUL\n",

      "title": "eIP 27: Update the USDT interest rate model",
      "content": "## Simple Summary\n\nThis proposal offers to update the USDT interest rate model by changing the Kink IR from 20% to 7% and the Max IR from 300% to 200%.\n\n## Implementation\n\n**Current interest rate model**\n|Asset|Base IR %|Kink IR %|Max IR %|Kink %|\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|USDT|0.00|20.00|300.00|0.80|\n\n**Proposed interest rate model**\n|Asset|Base IR %|Kink IR %|Max IR %|Kink %|\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|USDT|0.00|7.00|200.00|0.80|\n\n## Motivation and analysis\n\nUSDT currently uses the *Major* interest rate model with a 20% Kink IR and a 300% Max IR. The *Major* interest rate model is currently applied to assets such as ENS, RBN, PERP, and 1INCH. This model is not well suited to stablecoins due to its high kink interest rate of 20% and high maximum interest rate of 300%.\n\nAs a comparison, the USDC and DAI interest rate kinks are situated at 4%. USDT’s high Kink IR made it uneconomical for the market to reach high utilization. For example, the market’s utilization has remained between 27% and 40% for most of the last 30 days whereas USDC and DAI utilization ranged between 60% and 80%.\n\nLower utilization implies a larger spread between borrowers and lenders. This is because the interest borrowers pay is distributed across all lent assets. Lower utilization rates markets are less capital efficient for lenders.\n\nDespite the lower utilization, borrowers have been borrowing USDT at rates varying between 6.5% and 9.5% for the last 30 days. This shows that there is a lot of market demand to borrow USDT at relatively high-interest rates.\n\nAssuming borrowers will continue to borrow at similar rates, the utilization of the pool would increase from 27-40% to approximately 80% by lowering the Kink IR from 20% to 7%.\n\nAssuming a 7% borrow rate, this means that lenders will now earn 7% x 80% x 0.95 = 5.3% compared to 1.9% at 28% utilization given the current interest rate model. This represents a 2.8x increase in supply rates for lenders. Such an increase in capital efficiency is expected to drive additional capital inflows and more borrowing activity leading to more fees for the DAO. This change would also make Euler’s USDT market more competitive.\n\nLowering the Max IR from 300% to 200% will also contribute to making borrowing rates less volatile. The proposed Max IR of 200% for USDT is higher than USDC and DAI Max IRs thereby mitigating the market’s liquidity risk in case of high utilization.\n\nThe objective of this proposal is to increase the capital efficiency of the USDT market while mitigating the market’s liquidity risks.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nUpdating the USDT interest rate model will lead to higher market utilization and tighter spreads between borrowing and lending rates. This proposal would benefit the DAO and its users by making the protocol more capital efficient.",

      "title": "eIP 25: Decrease UNI and LINK Collateral Factors",
      "content": "## Simple Summary\n\nThis proposal offers to decrease UNI and LINK collateral factors from 0.3 to 0 thereby removing them from the collateral tier.\n\n## Abstract\n\nThis proposal offers to decrease UNI and LINK collateral factors to 0. While these assets still pass the thresholds on smart contract risks, oracle security, decentralization and volatility, the current lack of activity for these assets creates a situation where there is limited upside to maintain their collateral status on Euler.\n\nTo echo what @seraphim mentionned in [eIP 12](https://forum.euler.finance/t/eip-12-decrease-uni-link-and-matic-collateral-factors/222) there appears to be limited activity derived from maintaining capital-efficient collateral factors on assets beyond USDC, USDT, DAI, WETH, WSTETH and WBTC.\n\n## Motivation\n\nThe objective of this proposal is to decrease systemic risks on Euler. We believe that UNI and LINK have not met the expectations in terms of activity generated. We believe that the risks stemming from keeping these assets as collateral outweigh the benefits.\n\n[Recent events](https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2022/10/20/defi-exchange-mangos-114m-exploit-was-market-manipulation-not-a-hack-ex-fbi-special-agent-says/) have once again highlighted the risks of accepting less liquid tokens as collateral. Although the cost of manipulating UNI or LINK would be substantially higher than manipulating a token like Mango leaving these assets as collateral increases the risk profile of Euler with no clear upside for the protocol as these assets generate a minimal amount of fees.\n\n## Implementation\n\n|Contract|Method|Token|Token Address|Updates|\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|governance|setAssetConfig|LINK|0x514910771af9ca656af840dff83e8264ecf986ca|collateralFactor:0|\n|governance|setAssetConfig|UNI|0x1f9840a85d5af5bf1d1762f925bdaddc4201f984|collateralFactor:0|\n\n## Liquidation risk assessment\n\nThe proposed decrease in collateral factors will lead some accounts to become undercollateralized. We ran an analysis to assess how these changes would impact accounts holding UNI and LINK as collateral. Our analysis aims at determining how many accounts would become at risk of liquidation if we update these parameters.\n\n## LINK analysis\n\n|Address|LINK collateral|Account at risk of liquidation - Post update|\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|0xbdfa4f4492dd7b7cf211209c4791af8d52bf5c50|47,316.4|No|\n|0x3f60008dfd0efc03f476d9b489d6c5b13b3ebf2c|1,801.5|No|\n|0x9c0d1f4a029c46265831d120dee9cdc72f0ab3c3|349.3|No|\n|0xd95689c3ffca42f91fd347164c4eb6558ba96d18|12.4|No|\n|0x9f60699ce23f1ab86ec3e095b477ff79d4f409ad|0.9|No|\n|0x0bf93ea5a1fa4ce3dd22c7ffd314462d3869777f|0.0|No|\n\nSix accounts currently borrow against their LINK collateral on Euler. The proposed collateral factor update would not lead to any of these account becoming eligible for liquidation.\n\n## UNI analysis\n\n|Address|UNI collateral|Account at risk of liquidation - Post update|\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|0x139776871ee95f55d20b10d9ba5a0385451066cd|16,751.68|Yes|\n|0x3f60008dfd0efc03f476d9b489d6c5b13b3ebf2c|1,390.26|No|\n|0xa932e2c7d88497fdee9d87e5a450bae3874ff1a1|1,029.23|Yes|\n|0x68db91d7be097c96a7e4034105bb4861434f7710|178.93|No|\n|0x0003657abb17ede8c28bb40c81d20a6df35c9cb2|12.87|Yes|\n|0x53695fae79a11f1e91aacb73ea37e36a8c09baba|0.02|Yes|\n|0x0bf93ea5a1fa4ce3dd22c7ffd314462d3869777f|0.00|No|\n\nSeven accounts currently borrow against their UNI as collateral on Euler. Of these 7 accounts, 3 accounts would become at risk of liquidation due to the collateral factor update. These 3 accounts hold 17,793 UNI ($107K).\n\nWe propose to execute the collateral factor update **one month** after the snapshot vote closes. This delay will give time to affected users to update their positions accordingly.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nGiven the limited upside from maintaining collateral status and possibility of systemic risk stemming from bad debt, we think this change is appropriate given current market conditions.\n\nIf passed, the governance proposal will lead to lower health factors amongst some users, but according to our analysis no significant funds would be pushed into liquidation territory.",

      "content": "**Grant Request for Defishy to Create VaR Simulation Model With Euler Liquidation Health Graph View Implemented in EGP1**\n\nAuthor(s): Charlie Ambrose, Alex Craig, Luke Xie (Founders of Defishy.xyz)\n\nSubmission Date: October 10, 2022\n\n**Simple Summary**\n\nWe are requesting a grant to create Value at Risk simulation modeling with the Euler Liquidation Health Graph View that we implemented in eGP1. Value at risk (VaR) is the potential loss in value of a given portfolio/asset given a specified time period and confidence level. VaR modeling helps users understand the potential worst case scenario based on historical and probabilistic parameters. Our VaR modeling will measure Borrowed Capital at Risk and assess how likely it is that, based on current assets and historical metrics, an account’s liquidation health score will drop below 1 or to a place of liquidation. Liquidations, especially from whales, can trigger liquidation cascades, which can result in massive asset price drops and further liquidations–this occurred in May 2022 and was a primary contributor to the market crash. These new Euler modelings will help to protect Euler and Euler users from a repeat of this liquidation cascade scenario.\n\n**Abstract**\n\nThe Defishy team is composed of three members of Dartmouth Blockchain. Our philosophy is to continually provide value to the blockchain ecosystem through shipping useful products and research. The Defishy team consists of three individuals with development, design, and growth experience. We have extensive experience in DeFi, having contributed at Yeti Finance, NEAR, Temple DAO, and more.\n\n**Proven Euler Shippers**\n\nThe team recently completed eGP1 for Euler, which is currently live on Defishy.xyz. The grant led to previously unforeseen insights for Euler users and the Euler team. eGP1 was started on 8/10/22 and finished within its expected timeline on 8/31/22. The current dashboard allows users to view current liquidation health scores across Euler and helps to prevent further liquidation cascades like the one seen in May 2022.\n\n**Motivation**\n\nThere are a number of risk vectors in borrowing and lending protocols, including smart contract risk, price oracle manipulation risk, governance/pool management risk, and market risk (liquidations + bad debt). As protocols like Euler continue to onboard more users, it is increasingly important to equip users with necessary risk-management analytics for healthy activity. Safeguarding users against risk ensures the long-term sustainability of the protocol, as well as an improved user experience (competitive differentiation with other borrowing and lending protocols).\n\n**Specification & Implementation**\n\nWe are requesting a $20k initial grant (all $20k to be paid upon completion of the grant deliverables–-no payment required upfront) and $3.5k recurring on a monthly basis (paid on the first of each subsequent month the Euler community wants the app to be live, starting once the initial grant work is complete) to fund the development of a full data analytics/risk management suite for Euler with the following deliverables:\n\n- VaR equation development for understanding borrowed capital at risk and likelihood of liquidation health score below 1 (including VaR simulation for user-selected time periods)\n- Updated UI/UX from eGP1 that includes the ability for users to adjust the time frame for different simulation time periods\nIntegration of current Euler Graph View with VaR simulation modeling\n- Advanced filtering mechanics:\nAbility to filter both graph and table by asset types used for collateral and borrowed position\n- Ability to filter by the size of collateral (with the ability to eliminate self-collateralizing positions that will not be liquidated)\n- Pop-up breakdown of a wallet’s composition (health score, borrows, and collateral) when hovering over a wallet in the Graph View\n\nThe deliverables will be live at app.defishy.xyz/euler.\n\n**How long will development take?**\n\nWe estimate development time to take ~7-9 weeks from the proposal vote going through. Based on feedback from community members, we plan to continue iterating and shipping out new and useful features.\n\nWe will ship each deliverable/section when it is ready as opposed to waiting 7-9 weeks to ship everything at once. This will allow users to use the tools sooner as well as allow for more iteration and feedback.\n\n**What will the grant payment be used for?**\n\nTotal upon completion = $20k\n- $16.5k (upon completion) - contributor compensation for initial grant deliverable work\n- $3.5k (upon completion) - initial storage, database, and app upgrade costs\n\nTotal per month = $3.5k\n- $2.5k per month - team compensation to maintain app, maintain database, make adjustments, take feedback after set development date is complete, etc\n- $1k per month - App Upkeep costs\n          - Database storage (~$250-475/month)\n          - Server hosting (~$120-300/month)\n          - Ethereum nodes (~$100-220/month)\n\nThis contributor compensation is not retroactive for any updates we make to the current dashboard from eGP1. It is for our team to cover each member’s time cost to work on the grant over the allotted time frame and will cover design, frontend, backend, inspecting smart contracts, etc.",

      "title": "eGP 5: Grant request for Yacht Labs to improve native iOS interface for Euler Finance lending & borrowing",
      "content": "## Summary:\nWe are requesting an $18,000 grant for continued improvement of a native interface for Euler Finance in the Yacht iOS app.  Yacht is a native mobile application and dApp platform which allows users to interact with DeFi protocols on their devices.  You can download our MVP on our website (https://yachtlabs.io/app).  The MVP allows Euler users to view their accounts and configure custom notifications triggered by changes in health score and interest rates.  In this grant we propose to add the ability to actively manage your account (supply, borrow, self-mint, burn) as well as add enhanced visualizations described in the specification and implementation section.  By building a mobile interface for Euler, we aim to increase the user base of the protocol, increase TVL and give users the ability to manage their loans and borrows on the go.  \n\n## Abstract:\nYacht is a team of builders bringing decentralized mobile finance to all.  Henry Minden, a founder of the Constellation Network, and Adam Straus bring nearly 20 years of engineering experience to the team with a focus on mobile development.  Our senior designer Julian has worked closely with tech startups, emerging consumer brands, and Fortune 500 companies as a brand consultant, creative director, and advisor for over 15 years.  We are developing an iOS (and later Android) application which provides users with native interfaces for core DeFi primitives starting on the Ethereum network and expanding into multi-chain support.\n\nThere is currently not a single native interface for any major lending protocol on Ethereum.  Users must interact with these protocols on their PCs which limits usability and potential for reactivity.  In lending protocols, token price and interest rate volatility can require quick user action either to re-collateralize loans or to take advantage of market conditions to short/long an asset.  By enabling users to take action on their phone, they no longer worry about having access to their PCs to manage their assets.\n\nWe have already built out the basic read-only interface for Euler Finance lending and borrowing including notifications.  This grant will continue development to enable signing transactions with a hardware wallet and building out the mobile featureset to more fully match Euler’s desktop user interface. This includes hardware wallet functionality for borrowing and lending in any activated market, self-mint and burn, visualization of profit and loss and health score v time trajectory.\n\nWe are planning on open-sourcing the codebase for this work.  We firmly believe that the application layer of web3 needs to be openly auditable to ensure security and fairness for users.  Additionally, we would also be open to releasing an Euler-only version of the app if there is interest from the community.\n \n## Motivation:\nDeFi is growing at a rapid pace: there are $15 billion dollars in TVL in Ethereum lending protocols and a billion dollars flowing through Ethereum DEXs every day.  But there are still only about 5 million active DeFi wallets in the Ethereum ecosystem.  If we want the decentralized finance user base to grow and our protocols to be secured with higher TVL, we need to increase accessibility by enabling users to interact with core DeFi protocols on their mobile devices.\n\nThere are many mobile wallets out there, the most famous being Metamask and Coinbase Wallet.  But these wallets are not native integrations of DeFi protocols but rather require you to find the protocol you want to interact with in a dApp browser and open a web browser view on your phone to begin using the protocol.  Web views on mobile devices are not a natural path forward to onboard millions of users into DeFi.  As users of these protocols, we find interacting with DeFi on our mobile devices to be a painful experience.  At Yacht, we build integrations from the ground up with mobile UX in mind, leveraging our years of experience to provide users a great mobile product. \n\nWe chose Euler as our lending protocol because of its borrow/lending integration with any ERC20 token that has a WETH pair.  We value the core web3 tenets of composability and decentralization, so Euler Finance was a natural fit for Yacht.\n\nWith the completion of this app, Euler will have the distinction of being the only major ETH lending and borrowing protocol with a native mobile interface.\n\n## Benefits of Native Mobile:\n\nWith a mobile device, it becomes easy to stay updated on your borrowing and lending positions.  Push notifications enable users to respond to price changes and re-collateralize or pay back their loans quickly to prevent unexpected liquidations.  Users can also quickly check their borrowed assets interest rates to ensure they have enough tokens to pay down their loans and prevent liquidation.\n\nOnboarding with Yacht and managing your Euler accounts is simple.  We enable users to import existing private keys or seed phrases and manage any existing loans and borrows right when they start up the app.\n\n## Specification & Implementation:\nWe are requesting an initial $18,000 grant to fund the development of the Euler mobile interface with a full feature set that matches the web application’s interface:\n- Connecting a Ledger device to sign and send txs\n- Borrowing and Lending in any activated market\n- Ability to self-mint and burn \n- Visualization of profit and loss on deposited funds \n- Visualization of health score v time trajectory based on current market conditions\n\nWe ask for 70% of the funds ($12,600) payable up-front, and the remaining 30% ($5,400) payable upon production launch and open sourcing of the aforementioned feature set.\n\n## How Long Will Development Take:\nTo ensure that we have built a robust system, we expect development to take 6 to 8 weeks from the proposal vote going through.\n\nWhat will the $18,000 be used for?\n\n- AWS costs ($1000)\n- Node provider cost ($1000)\n- Contributor Compensation ($16,000)\n\nTo enable notifications, we will need to host a database which tracks users’ loans.  We will only store data that is publicly accessible on the blockchain and will not be collecting any personal data or other information that is not publicly available.  A mapping will be stored between a user’s device ID and settings they have determined regarding when to notify them of changes in market conditions.\n\n## Future Roadmap:\nAfter the successful completion of this grant, the Yacht Labs teams intends to add the following feature set:\n\n- Android App \n- One-touch leveraged longs/shorts through self mints and AMM swaps.\n- Enhanced visualizations of portfolio\n\n## Voting\n\nYes Vote - Yes, fund $18,000 ($12,600 up-front, $5,400 on completion) to Yacht Labs Inc. Ethereum address (yachtlabs.eth) to build an open source native iOS app to manage Euler Finance accounts\n\nNo Vote - No, don’t fund Yacht Labs Inc. and remain without a native iOS app integration\n\nContact: straus@yachtlabs.io, henry@yachtlabs.io\n",

      "title": "eGP 4: Grant Request for Messari Financial Reports",
      "content": "Summary\nWe are proposing that Messari provides semi-annual financial reports for Euler. This would serve to better inform existing stakeholders as well as attract new ones.\n\nThese reports would live as free resources on Messari and would be distributed through our newsletter, various social channels, and distribution partners including S&P Global and Bloomberg.\n\nWe are requesting a $50,000 grant to support the work that goes into creating these reports. \n\nMotivation\nInvestor relations are a necessary function of any company to keep existing stakeholders adequately informed while also attracting new ones through better surfacing of fundamental data. This is even more essential in the open-source world of crypto where there are a wider set of stakeholders including users, developers, and investors that can actively contribute value to the DAO allocating their time and money to grow the network.\n\nWhile projects often have scattered data dashboards, analytics pages, or other resources to better understand the protocol and the economic activity around it, there remains a need for standardized reporting so that anyone can analyze it like they would using a company’s annual financial statement.\n\nAs we continue in a bear market, this becomes increasingly important as people tend to overweight price as their barometer of project success. By outsourcing this critical investor relations function to a specialist firm, Euler can be better positioned to withstand turbulent times and retain the mindshare of major crypto participants.\n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreia66qpcllamyu3nykoffohlyivyhl5sr6c5mpjmn3ark65urfgw4q)\n    \nBackground\nMessari is a team of crypto natives passionate about building powerful data analytics tools for the web3 world. The company was started in early 2018 and has since scaled to over 120 employees after raising a Series A led by Point 72 Ventures. We recently received a $12.5 million grant from The Graph to become a core developer to build and standardize subgraphs creating a robust open-source data infrastructure for the broader crypto ecosystem.\n\nMessari’s core products include Messari Enterprise, a leading market intelligence platform for crypto professionals as well as Messari Protocol Services, an outsourced research and investor relations service for many of the top DAOs. This has included long-form research, comprehensive data dashboards, and quarterly reporting for over 150 projects.\n\nWe have worked with Euler in the past on an initiation of coverage report as well as subgraph development\n\nSpecification\nWe’ll create two semi-annual reports with the first released in early Jan '23, that present and analyze key KPIs and fundamental metrics (loans originated, deposits, protocol revenue, etc.) from both a macro protocol level as well as more granular specific markets. The report will delve into major governance developments, upgrades, and key roadmap initiatives on a recurring basis.\n\nThese reports would be sent out to our newsletter that reaches over 250k crypto professionals as well as redistributed on the Bloomberg terminal, S&P Capital IQ, and Refinitiv, three of the largest traditional finance platforms in the world with over 1 million active users.\n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreiaw3htdkevkdkpb6pvmk7bbgynnng7zsesdljj3m24jcajnlfwneu)\n    \nPricing\nThe reports are $25k/per bringing total cost to $50,000 paid in stablecoins ",

      "title": "eIP 23: Decreasing the proposal threshold",
      "content": "## Simple Summary\n\nThis proposal offers to decrease the proposal threshold to 500 EUL.\n\n## Motivation\n\nOn September 26 the EulerDAO approved the [eIP 19: Increasing the amount of votes necessary for the proposal threshold and quorum](https://snapshot.org/#/eulerdao.eth/proposal/0x145d78e03b1e95e9e7c04c3ff56e5c8c89aebf28b8ec616ba93849d8d9716579) that, among other things, set a 10K EUL proposal threshold.\n\nDespite there were mainly no critical comments to the proposal (except for [one](https://forum.euler.finance/t/eip-19-increasing-the-amount-of-votes-necessary-for-the-proposal-threshold-and-quorum/385/6?u=raslambek)) and it was approved, after eIP 19 came into force, the community raised concerns that the 10K threshold was too high and could affect the principle of decentralization that lies at the core of any DAO.\n\nMoreover some expressed concerns that it could lead to discouraging participation and discussion within the community.\n\nIt was also pointed out that having a proposal threshold equal to the quorum would open up to potential governance attacks if someone creating a proposal has the option to pass it unless he/she has votes against this proposal.\n\nBased on the concerns raised and discussions held, it was pointed out that:\n\n* among current [public delegates](https://app.euler.finance/delegates) there is only one passing 10k threshold.\n* out of [64 wallets](https://etherscan.io/token/0xd9fcd98c322942075a5c3860693e9f4f03aae07b#balances) with >10K EUL majority belongs to the EulerLabs team members or are affiliated with EulerLabs or EulerDAO investors.\n* At the same time, the vast majority of wallets has <100 EUL.\n* It means that other 1800 token holders, even with a delegation system in place, are unlikely to be able to reach a necessary threshold. At the same time, it is obvious that the DAO should not rely upon the team to propose and publish proposals.\n\nThere was also carried out a [Comparative analysis of the threshold metrics](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1T1OOMfbdmHbKbPlQPQ_rthaMqtr_nUqVg2FD-pnreuA/edit#gid=904893745) of some popular DAOs including those representing other major DeFi credit protocols, including AAVE, Compound, Curve etc. The analysis revealed that the current threshold applied in EulerDAO is 12-14 times higher than the average among other DAOs.\n\nIf the threshold is adjusted with the average based on other DAOs it would have to be set at 700-800 EUL.\n\nHowever, referring to the fact that EulerDAO is at its grassroot level compared to other DAOs from the analysis, the community highlighted that the threshold should be even smaller.\n\nAccording to the [survey conducted among the community members in Discord](https://discord.com/channels/742749441697513632/1024370270972162058/1025150207593295872), the absolute majority advocated for setting the threshold at 500 EUL. Thus, around 20% of holders would be able to create proposals.\n\n**Benefits**\n\n* empowering more active EUL holders or delegates who want to participate in the governance, including by creating proposals on their own, to able to do so;\n* increasing decentralization, which is the core value of a DAO;\n\n**Downside**\n\n* could, possibly, make the DAO more vulnerable against malicious attacks\n\n**Voting**\n\n“Yes” - Decreasing the proposal threshold to 500 EUL\n\n“No” - Do nothing",

      "title": "eIP 21: Deploy SwapHub module and swap handlers ",
      "content": "## Motivation\n\nEuler’s current Swap module contains hard-coded support for swapping on 1inch and Uniswap3. In order to add new swapping methods, or improvements/optimisations to existing methods, new Swap module implementations must be created and deployed. This development cycle is slow, in part because the Swap module is executing in the context of the Euler contract so it is critical that it not have any vulnerabilities.\n\n\n## Implementation\n\nIn order to speed the development process, Euler Labs has created a new module named SwapHub. This module delegates all the actual swapping logic to external contracts, called swap handlers. It works by transferring in the input token to the handler, and then invoking the handler with the user’s swapping parameters. The handler should perform a swap and then transfer the output token back to Euler, along with any remaining input token (if any). The SwapHub will then validate that the amounts received back satisfy the user’s swapping parameters (such as slippage), and if so, finalise the swap. With this design, a bug in a swap handler will not pose a threat to the core Euler protocol.\n\nIn addition to the new interface, the SwapHub development work has also created a general-purpose Uniswap router handler that can use both Uniswap2 and Uniswap3, and has improved the handling for rebasing tokens such as stETH.\n\n\n## Conclusion\nThis upgrade proposes to install the new SwapHub module, deploy the swap handlers, and to complete the UI features that will use this module.\n\nResources:\n\n* [SwapHub documentation](https://github.com/euler-xyz/euler-docs/pull/54/files)\n* [SwapHub pull request](https://github.com/euler-xyz/euler-contracts/pull/147)\n* [Omniscia audit](https://omniscia.io/reports/euler-finance-swaphub/)",

      "content": "## Motivation\n\nThis proposal is a follow-up of the [eIP 18](https://forum.euler.finance/t/eip-18-move-all-asset-price-oracles-to-chainlink-where-available-ahead-of-the-merge/349) that proposed to move all asset price oracles to Chainlink where available. Since the proposal was voted and implemented, a few new markets have been activated on Euler for which Chainlink oracles can be used. In that regard, eIP 18 [risk assessment and analysis](https://forum.euler.finance/t/eip-18-move-all-asset-price-oracles-to-chainlink-where-available-ahead-of-the-merge/349#motivation-2) still hold.\n\nAlso, one of the price feeds has been [scheduled](https://docs.chain.link/docs/data-feeds/deprecating-feeds/) to be deprecated on Oct 12th 2022, hence to keep the market secure, its oracle should be moved back to Uniswap v3 TWAP.\n\n## Implementation\n\nThe following assets will switch to Chainlink should eIP 22 pass:\n\n1. FRAX\n2. FXS\n3. COMP\n\nThe following assets will switch back to Uniswap v3 TWAP oracle should eIP 22 pass:\n\n1. LRC, 0.3% pool will be used\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThese changes will switch the price oracle for newly activated markets where available. This is intended to increase the security of these markets and lower overall systemic risk on the protocol post Merge. Additionally, the market for which Chainlink price feed will be deprecated will be switched back to the Uniswap v3 TWAP oracle that was used for it pre-eIP 18.",

      "title": "eGP 3: Grant request for Shippooor to develop Euler risk tooling",
      "content": "# Summary\n\nWe propose building multiple simulation and risk monitoring tools for the Euler DAO. These tools will allow anyone to validate the robustness of collateral and borrow factors, simplify collateral asset onboarding analyses, and enable protocol-wide simulations.\n\nWe are asking for a $80,000 grant from the Euler DAO grant program to build these simulation tools.\n\n# Motivation\n\nLending protocols like Euler need to constantly monitor their risk exposure as market conditions change. We want to provide the Euler DAO with custom tooling to more easily and more transparently monitor risk vectors.\n\nWe believe that allowing users to easily simulate scenarios and regularly backtest collateral parameters will be extremely useful to the DAO. We believe these tools will enable community members to more actively participate in the DAO’s risk management decisions while making them more transparent.\n\n# Background\n\nOur team has completed multiple analytics and tooling projects for well-known DeFi protocols such as Aave, dYdX, Instadapp, Uniswap, and Notional. For example here a some of the tools we have built:\n\n* [Notional analytics dashboard](https://info.notional.finance/)\n* [Aave account simulation tool](https://aave.shippooor.xyz/accounts/) *(still under development)*\n* [Dune profile](https://dune.com/shippooordao)\n* [Euler subgraph](https://thegraph.com/hosted-service/subgraph/euler-xyz/euler-mainnet)\n\nWe have also collaborated with the Euler core team over the past few months by contributing to the development of the Euler subgraph, the Euler Dune dashboard, and minor parts of the Euler UI. Our knowledge of DeFi lending protocols and of Euler specifically will be key in allowing us to deliver useful tools to the DAO.\n\n# Specification\n\nWe propose to build the following risk and monitoring tools for the Euler DAO:\n### System-wide simulation tools\n\n* Simulate the impacts of changes in asset prices for one or all Euler accounts. The simulation will output the simulated account values, LTV, and healthscores of all Euler accounts.\n* Simulate the impacts of changes in collateral or borrow factors to see how many accounts would be at risk of liquidation given certain parameter changes.\n* Simulate the protocol system-wide Value at Risk (VaR) based on custom scenarios (95%, 99% VaR).\n* Monitor the cumulative Debt at Risk for all collateral assets.\n* Monitor account sizes by liquidation prices for all collateral assets.\n\n### Liquidation profitability and collateral factor backtesting tools\n\n* Simulate the historical liquidation profitability of a simulated account based on historical data (gas prices, spot prices, historical on-chain liquidity).\n* Assess how quickly the account would have been profitable to liquidate given its size and market conditions. Showcase the historical worst time to liquidation.\n* Run a sensitivity analysis looking at how much bad debt the protocol would have accrued for a given set of accounts using different borrow and collateral factors.\n\n### Collateral onboarding tools\n\n* Analyze the historical on-chain liquidity of new potential collateral assets. The tool will output an analysis of historical slippage on major DEXes.\n* Analyze the historical on-chain volatility of new potential collateral assets. The tool will output an analysis of historical volatility and maximum drawdown measures for given periods of time.\n* Run a borrow and collateral factor backtesting analysis of new potential collateral assets.\n\n# Development budget and timeline\n\nWe estimate the development cost of building and hosting these tools at $80K. We propose that the DAO funds 25% of the grant upfront and 75% upon delivery of the tools.\n\nWe estimate the total development time at 8-12 weeks from the time of the initial grant approval. This includes backend work, design, UI, and testing.\n\nWe propose setting a bi-weekly call with key members of the Euler core team to update them on our progress and get additional feedback.\n\n# Voting\n\n* Yes - Approve and fund the development of a system-wide simulation tool, collateral factor backtesting tool, and of a collateral onboarding tool by the Shippooor team.\n* No - Vote against the funding and development of a system-wide simulation tool, collateral factor backtesting tool, and of a collateral onboarding tool by the Shippooor team.\n\n",

      "content": "\n## Simple Summary\nThis proposal offers to increase efficiency of the Governance process by increasing proposal threshold and quorum to 10 k EUL.\n\n## Motivation\nThe motivation behind the proposal is to lower the risk of manipulation of the Euler governance via Snaphot.\n\n**As of now, the number of votes sufficient for Quorum is 1k.**\n\nHowever, based on the data provided in the EulerFinance Documentation (https://docs.euler.finance/governance/eul), it is assumed that the current number of EUL tokens in circulation is approximately 8 millions. That means that **Quorum equals just 0,0125% of the current circulation**.\n\nAt the same time, it is clear that not all the token holders take part in the voting on a regular basis. Analysis of the data available for the previous voting ( [Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/eulerdao.eth) ) shows that the **average number of votes participated in the polls amounts to 35,5k and the average number of voters is 434**.\n\n![image](ipfs://bafkreiflnhda23xkacyvxfqoeyy424szmoo3fgyg77ybtzvpweyxy7ua2i)\n    \nIt was registered during the voting, that some wallets possess (or act as a delegate) an amount of EUL that is several times greater than the Quorum. For example,\n0xf69EA6646cf682262E84cd7c67133eac59cef07b = 3k EUL\n0xeD95cbd2185924807e3B893B7E7Ac5dFE2efe33F = 5k EUL\n0xf69EA6646cf682262E84cd7c67133eac59cef07b = 5,4 k EUL\n0xD178F2d93B92Ac47cf51a899463Eca8acC37A8D5 = 20 k EUL\netc.\nIt means that a small group of people or even one person could pass a quorum and accept/reject a proposal in their own interest disregarding the possible outcome and consequences of a decision for the Protocol in general.\nBased on the assumptions mentioned above, I suggest:\n\nIncreasing the number of votes necessary to proposal threshold on the Snaphot to 10 k (0,125% of the current circulation).\n\nIncreasing the number of votes necessary to reach Quorum for the Snaphot voting to 10 k, (0,125% of the current circulation).\n\n###### Benefits\nIncrease legitimacy of votes\nPrevent low cost governance attacks.\n\n###### Downside\nMakes it “harder” for a proposal to be put to a vote and passed.\n\n## Voting\n\n###### “Yes” -\n\nIncreasing the number of votes necessary to proposal threshold on the Snaphot to 10 k (0,125% of the current circulation).\n\nIncreasing the number of votes necessary to reach Quorum for the Snaphot voting to 10 k, (0,125% of the current circulation).\n\n###### “No” - Do nothing",

      "title": " eIP20: Promote USDT to Collateral Tier",
      "content": "Simple Summary\n\nProposal includes a batch of changes to the Tether token (USDT) on Euler. These include: promotion of USDT to the collateral tier. Increase of USDT collateral factor to 0.90. Increase of USDT borrow factor to 0.94. Enable cross borrowing. Reduce reserve factor to 0.05 (previously 0.10, amended after forum discussion).\n\nWe do commit to backstopping liquidations on USDT should the price slip below 0.97 on Euler.\n\nBackground\n\nOur team has been active in the crypto space since 2017 and we manage several hundred million Usd in various strategies in the crypto ecosystem.\n\nMotivation\n\nThe motivation behind this proposal is to make it attractive to bring substantial USDT TVL liquidity to Euler Finance and to popularise Tether within DeFi. Being one of the primary minters and redeemers of USDT, we have a deep understanding of risks involved in Tether through extensive due diligence and believe the tradeoff favours this proposal.\n\nTether is a $70 billion market cap stablecoin with an extremely efficient redemption mechanism capable of handling hundreds of millions in volumes every day. This is why it’s extensively used by reputable trading houses and funds.\n\nThis proposal would make Euler the first major DeFi lending protocol to allow USDT as collateral and hence give the firms mentioned above an opportunity to tap into what Euler has to offer using their Tether balance sheet. As a result, this will create competitive lending APYs for USDT as traditional finance firms have consistently shown an appetite to short USDT.\n\nAlso while the debate on USDC vs USDT is far from being resolved and counts many supporters on both sides, we believe the market to be the best judge. Being widely traded and trusted by large CeFi institutional players, allowing USDT’s collateral status and risk parameter to match USDC’s would harmonise risk factors between CeFi and DeFi and lead to more competition on the stablecoin front.\n\nImplementation\n\nI propose the following: promote USDT to the collateral tier. Increase of USDT collateral factor to 0.90 like USDC. Increase of USDT borrow factor to 0.94. Enable cross borrowing. Reduce reserve factor to 0.10.\n\nWe also commit to backstopping USDT liquidations on Euler Finance should the price slip below 0.97. Due to Euler’s liquidation architecture, we’d be able to liquidate users at 0.97 and keep eUSDT on our balance sheet.\n\nRisk Assessment\n\nWhile Tether has faced scrutiny from regulators and pundits in the past, it has made great progress in terms of transparency and efficiency. For example, it has recently released a Proof of Reserves report done by BDO (top 5 auditing firm):\n\nhttps://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-08-18/tether-drops-cayman-islands-firm-in-bdo-italia-attestation-deal 2\n\nAdditionally, it has settled with the NY attorney general on favourable terms that do not encumber Tether as a business while committing to reporting their activity to the NY attorney general on a quarterly basis.\n\nIn terms of the market mechanism, USDT is second to none. Its redemption mechanism is able to handle hundreds of millions and volumes every day even during the toughest market environments (such as May this year). This is something that we know of from our own experience, which is why we believe the Tether “FUD” is unsubstantiated.\n\nNot only is the redemption mechanism working smoothly, USDT is also one of the most liquid assets off and on-chain and a DeFi liquidation cascade would very unlikely lead to bad debt for the protocol.\n\nConclusion\n\nUSDT ranks extremely high in terms of market liquidity, redemption mechanism, and trust amongst institutional players. Adding it as collateral to Euler finance will likely unleash lots of inflows and would be beneficial to Euler and its users.",

      "title": "eGP2: Grant Request for IntoTheBlock to Develop Risk Management Tools for Euler",
      "content": "###  Summary\n\nIntoTheBlock (ITB) is requesting a grant to build a set of risk management solutions for Euler and its community:\n1. A dashboard monitoring general and pool-specific risk indicators\n2. API access and CSV downloads for all these indicators\n3. Documentation covering Euler’s risk dynamics\n4. A comprehensive report diving deep into Euler’s risk metrics and status\n\nThe dashboard would be hosted on a new risk management section within IntoTheBlock’s platform. Each indicator’s data would be openly available for Euler Labs and Euler’s users to track economic risk conditions, and will be updated on a daily basis. On a quarterly basis IntoTheBlock’s team would add support for more assets, update indicators and status reports.\n\n### Abstract\n\nIntoTheBlock has been deeply involved in DeFi over the past two years. This began with the launch of DeFi Insights analytics and grew substantially through its institutional quantitative strategies (ITB Quant) services. ITB’s DeFi Quant Platform serves as the gateway used by over 20 of the largest crypto institutions to access DeFi yields via sophisticated quantitative strategies with corresponding risk management models. Euler’s strategies have been one of the newest additions to the ITB DeFi Quant platform.\n\nTo help streamline institutional adoption of DeFi, IntoTheBlock decided to enable access to its risk indicators and models via APIs and analytics dashboards. The objective of this proposal is to enable those risk models for Euler’s institutional and retail investors.\n\n### Motivation\n\nRisk monitoring and management is paramount for any financial service. The recent events in the DeFi market have proven that risk management is essential to catalyze the growth of the space. At ITB we believe that risk management in DeFi should be done out in the open, following crypto’s ethos, and not be a luxury expense.\n\nFollowing ITB’s experience safeguarding hundreds of millions into DeFi through advanced risk management models, we believe that expanding these tools and offering them to Euler would help make DeFi safer over the mid- to long-term. Enabling real time economic risk monitoring for Euler should be an important element to provide confidence to institutional and retail investors.\n\n### Specification & Implementation\n\nIntoTheBlock is requesting $85,000 to enable near real-time economic risk monitoring and analytics for the Euler protocol. Specifically, the grant will cover the following deliverables:\n- Economic Risk API: REST API enabling access to dozens of economic risk indicators in the Euler protocol.\n- Economic Risk Dashboard: Web interface that includes visualizations of the most important risk indicators.\n- Documentation: Complete documentation of all risk indicators included in the release.\n- Quarterly Report: Brief report outlining risk vectors affecting Euler, its current status and evolution.\n\nThese deliverables will be split into three main milestones, requesting $20k to be paid upon completion of each plus $25k upfront. Additionally, we propose a $5k management fee to update and iterate upon these metrics based on community feedback.\n\n### Euler ITB Grant Milestones & Payments:\n1. Upfront payment ($25k)\n2. Indicators 1-10 (dashboard + API) ($20k)\n3. Indicators 11-20 (dashboard + API) ($20k)\n4. Documentation covering Euler’s risk dynamics + comprehensive report diving into Euler’s risk metrics and current status ($20k)\n\nThis release will include the risk indicators outlined in this document for the seven assets supported as collateral on the Euler protocol at this time. Some indicators will be available from a general viewpoint of the protocol, others apply specifically to each asset individually and some will be displayed from both categories as specified in the spreadsheet. The following Figma mock-up made by ITB’s design team demonstrates how the proposed layout would look like. (Keep in mind that this does not yet include live data from protocol and is just for reference).\n\nThese indicators are subject to modification based on feedback from the community and Euler’s team. IntoTheBlock is committed to maintain and expand the capabilities of the Euler risk monitoring solution that address changes to the protocol or market conditions.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIntoTheBlock’s proposal looks to enable real time economic risk monitoring for the Euler protocol. The risk indicators included in this proposal are based on IntoTheBlock’s experience managing and monitoring risk for Euler and similar protocols. The initial release is an attempt to democratize access to sophisticated risk models for all investors participating in the Euler protocol.\n\n### Voting\n\nYes - Have ITB build these risk management tools for the Euler community, providing an initial upfront payment and the rest as milestones are accomplished\n\nNo - Don't fund ITB and remain without advanced economic risk management tools\n\n",

      "title": "eIP 18: Move all asset price oracles to Chainlink where available ahead of the Merge",
      "content": "## Simple Summary\n\nAll markets on Euler currently use Uniswap v3 for their price oracles. This proposal suggests moving all assets on Euler over to Chainlink where available, following its integration as part of eIP 14. This should help to allay some concerns about a reduction in the manipulation cost of Uniswap oracles after the Merge.\n\n## Motivation\n\nThe Merge from PoW to PoS is a consensus layer change on Ethereum that is due to take place sometime around mid September of this year. After the Merge, block proposers will be chosen deterministically before they validate blocks. This feature creates new challenges for decentralised price oracles, like those provided by Uniswap v3, because it opens up greater potential for inter-block price manipulation.\n\nAt present, a Uniswap v3 price oracle is often extremely expensive to manipulate (see an article I wrote about this [here](https://github.com/euler-xyz/uni-v3-twap-manipulation/blob/master/cost-of-attack.pdf)). An attacker must move the spot price of an asset by a very large % for at least one block in order to impact the time-weighted average price (TWAP) oracle. This exposes them to the risk of arbitrage. Any price manipulation will usually be countered by MEV bots, rendering attacks more costly than any benefit a price manipulator could usually hope to achieve.\n\nHowever, after the Merge, block proposers will be alerted ahead of time when they are selected to propose a block. This gives them a unique opportunity to carry out oracle manipulation attacks. If they are chosen to propose block n, then they can attempt to manipulate the spot price on block n-1, knowing that they will be free to arbitrage their own price manipulation on the next block (and censor any other attempts at arbitrage).\n\nIt is hard to estimate how many block proposers will view oracle manipulation attacks as a legitimate way to increase their income. It seems likely many will not take the risk of carrying out these kinds of attacks. However, so long as the number is non-zero, it is clear there is some degree of reduced cost for carrying out oracle manipulation attacks after the Merge.\n\n##  Hypothetical Attack on TWAPs Post-Merge\n\nThe first option is for the validator of block *n* (i.e. the attacker) to bribe a darkpool service like flashbots to include their manipulation transaction in block *n-1*. This is feasible, but involves some risk. As far as I’m aware, there’s no guarantee that the validator won’t still take advantage of the arbitrage opportunity for themselves. Note also that if the transaction isn’t LAST in the block, then any ordinary trades that happen after the manipulation transaction will probably be costly to the attacker. Imagine finding out you swapped 1 ETH for 1,000,000,000 because you happened to nip in after the attacker’s manipulation, but before they were able to arbitrage themselves back.\n\nThe second option is that the attacker has sufficient stake controlled to be able to wait until they can propose two blocks in a row. In this scenario, they can safely manipulate the spot price on block *n-1* AND arbitrage it back themselves on block *n*. You might think it quite unlikely that a validator would get to propose two blocks in a row, but actually it might be relatively common (see Table below from this [article ](https://alrevuelta.github.io/posts/ethereum-mev-multiblock)).\n\nColumn shows number of blocks validated consecutively. Rows shows percentage of stake controlled. So, for example, if you have 5% of the stake, then there is a 7.14% probability that you will get two blocks in a row in a given epoch. Which is pretty high, in my opinion. I expect most staking pools won’t be viewing oracle manipulation attacks as legitimate sources of MEV, but even small staking pools will hit upon this opportunity once in a while.\n\n \n![787b356bcb5b3750a34aa234c2aeb6d133230e19.jpeg](ipfs://bafkreihjlwx7czo7vf3ushsiutc2enuhdlbzd5u2jzlwlbrntngg6apgv4)\n    \n\nIn the medium-term, the Euler Labs team have continued their research on oracle manipulation attacks and will propose new solutions for this kind of attack in the future. You can read more about some of their early research on this [here](https://ethresear.ch/t/median-prices-as-alternative-to-twap-an-optimised-proof-of-concept-analysis-and-simulation/12778). However, in the short-term, a clear solution to reduce concerns about oracle security ahead of the Merge is to switch at least some markets over to Chainlink (a new integration introduced as part of [eIP 14](https://forum.euler.finance/t/eip-14-contract-upgrades/305/7)).\n\nChainlink oracles have secured billions of dollars worth of assets across DeFi for many years at this point, and are the market leader in their sector. Whilst not free from their own criticism (see [here](https://twitter.com/MTorgin/status/1516732505444999168?s=20&t=0kFkYe7hjoJ6DD5pAzuqPQ), and response [here](https://twitter.com/chainlink/status/1528850004059623424?s=20&t=mS-MbWC3YCn3vro4w7kU5g)), Chainlink oracles have not yet failed other major DeFi lending protocols, like Compound and Aave. The proposal would therefore be to move WETH, USDC, DAI, WBTC, UNI, and LINK over to the new Chainlink system. One might include a wstETH oracle too.\n\n##  Implementation\nThe following assets will switch to Chainlink should eIP 18 pass:\n\n**Collateral Assets**\n\n1. WETH\n2. USDC\n3. DAI\n4. WBTC\n5. UNI\n6. LINK\n7. stETH\n\n**Cross Assets**\n\n1. USDT\n2. ENS\n3. SHIB\n4. MATIC\n5. CVX\n6. MKR\n7. PERP\n8. AXS\n\n**Isolated Assets**\n\n1. FTT\n2. LDO\n3. AAVE\n4. SNX\n5. OGN\n6. GRT\n7. 1INCH\n8. DPI\n9. RAI\n10. WNXM\n11. ANT\n12. BADGER\n13. STETH\n14. GTC\n15. APE\n16. YFI\n17. ILV\n18. NMR\n19. MIM\n20. IMX\n21. LUSD\n22. LRC\n23. REQ\n24. IMX\n\n## Risk Assessment\n\nThe Chainlink oracle change has undergone auditing by Omniscia:\n\n[https://omniscia.io/reports/euler-finance-chainlink-support/](https://omniscia.io/reports/euler-finance-chainlink-support/)\n\nIt has also been reviewed by Sherlock:\n\n[https://www.hacknote.co/17c261f7d8fWbdml/1821f966f40pJG_t](https://www.hacknote.co/17c261f7d8fWbdml/1821f966f40pJG_t)\n\n## Vote\n\nYes means you support shifting the price feed of the above mentioned assets to Chainlink.\nNo means you do not support shifting the price feed of the above mentioned assets to Chainlink.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThese changes will switch the price oracle for all assets over to the new Chainlink integration where availlable. This is intended to increase security of these markets and lower overall systemic risk on the protocol ahead of the Merge in mid-September.\n\n## Relevant Links\n\nUni v3 TWAP oracle attack cost research:\n\nhttps://github.com/euler-xyz/uni-v3-twap-manipulation/blob/master/cost-of-attack.pdf\n\nMedian oracle research:\n\nhttps://ethresear.ch/t/median-prices-as-alternative-to-twap-an-optimised-proof-of-concept-analysis-and-simulation/12778\n\nChainlink criticism:\n\nhttps://twitter.com/MTorgin/status/1516732505444999168?s=20&t=0kFkYe7hjoJ6DD5pAzuqPQ\n\nChainlink response:\n\nhttps://twitter.com/chainlink/status/1528850004059623424?s=20&t=mS-MbWC3YCn3vro4w7kU5g\n\neIP 14 (Chainlink):\n\nhttps://forum.euler.finance/t/eip-14-contract-upgrades/305#governance-5",

      "title": "eIP 17: Promote stETH to Collateral Tier",
      "content": "## Simple Summary\n\nProposal includes a batch of changes to the Lido Staked ETH token (stETH) on Euler. These include: promotion of stETH to the collateral tier. Increase of stETH collateral factor to 0.87. Increase of stETH borrow factor to 0.91. Enable cross borrowing. Reduce reserve factor to 0.10.\n\n## Motivation\n\nThis is a proposal to promote stETH to the collateral tier on Euler, enabling Euler users to borrow against it. stETH fits the collateral eligibility criteria of a collateral asset. Post eIP16, it will be backed by a robust oracle (chainlink). It is widely distributed and decentralised. It has very high liquidity on numerous decentralised exchanges. Smart contract risk is relatively low.\n\nAt the moment, the wrapped version of stETH (wstETH) is collateral on Euler and can be effectively used to go levered long and short on Lido’s staked version of ETH.\n\nIn fact, Euler is the only place on-chain where users can short wstETH, which so far has [led to additional 2% yield for lenders](https://twitter.com/MacroMate8/status/1558127517701062656). This is possible because wstETH has a robust oracle on Uniswap V3.\n\nHowever, the more popular unwrapped version of stETH does not have a strong oracle on Uniswap V3 because Uniswap does not support rebasing tokens. This is why Chainlink is necessary and finally possible after implementing [eIP14](https://forum.euler.finance/t/eip-14-contract-upgrades/305/7) and [eIP16](https://forum.euler.finance/t/eip-16-change-steth-pricing-to-chainlink-and-amend-the-interest-rate-model/347).\n\n## Implementation\n\nGiven the presence of a high-quality price feed (ie Chainlink), I am proposing a collateral factor of 0.87 (below WBTC and WETH but higher than DAI) and a borrow factor of 0.91 (same as WETH and WBTC).\n\nThis would make Euler’s LTVs extremely competitive while not overly increasing systemic risk.\n\nAlso, I propose reducing the reserve factor to 0.10 (just as wstETH) to decrease the Borrow/Supply APY spread and enable cross borrowing for capital efficiency’s sake.\n\n## Risk Assessment\n\nLido audits:\nhttps://github.com/lidofinance/audits\n\nstETH is one the most traded assets in DeFi with over $500mil supplied on Curve, but also Uniswap and Balancer (wrapped version of stETH).\n\nIt has been listed as collateral on Aave and became immediately successful due to appetite for long basis trades. Its wrapped version (wsETH) has become one of the most utilised pools on Euler, and performed extremely well even during heighted market volatility.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nstETH ranks high on oracle security, volatility, liquidity, decentralisation and smart contract risk. We therefore recommend implementing the proposed eIP.",

      "title": "eIP 16: Change stETH pricing to Chainlink and amend the interest rate model",
      "content": "## Simple Summary\n\nProposal includes changing the stETH oracle on Euler from Uniswap V3 to Chainlink and amending the interest rate model to take into account borrowing activity.\n\n## Motivation\n\nThe goal of the proposal is to pave the way for stETH as collateral on Euler by giving stETH a reliable pricing feed (1) and letting lenders earn both staking rewards and APYs paid by borrowers (2).\n\nAt the moment, the wrapped version of stETH (wstETH) is collateral and can be effectively used to go levered long and short on Lido’s staked version of ETH.\n\nIn fact, Euler is the only place on-chain where users can short wstETH, which so far [has led to additional 2% yield for lenders](https://twitter.com/MacroMate8/status/1558127517701062656). This is possible because wstETH has a [robust oracle](https://info.uniswap.org/#/pools/0xd340b57aacdd10f96fc1cf10e15921936f41e29c) on Uniswap V3.\n\nHowever, the more popular unwrapped version of stETH does not have a strong oracle on Uniswap V3 because Uniswap does not support rebasing tokens. This is why Chainlink is necessary and finally possible after implementing [eIP14](https://forum.euler.finance/t/eip-14-contract-upgrades/305#governance-5).\n\nSimilarly, the interest rate model needs changing due to the nature of rebasing tokens. In the case of wstETH, the wstETH/WETH exchange rate increases in time, meaning that wstETH borrowers’ debt to lenders automatically increases as the exchange rate goes up. This means that lenders don’t miss out on staking rewards as the borrower’s debt takes them into account.\n\nThat, however, is not the case with stETH. At the moment, should a user borrow stETH on Euler, the borrower will be entitled to the rewards of the borrowed tokens. Any unborrowed tokens in the pool will accrue to lenders.\n\nThe new interest rate model seeks to correct that by amending the base interest rate (IR% at 0% utilisation) to the staking reward APY. This way, the borrowers will be paying the lenders whatever they owe in terms of staking rewards.\n\n## Risk Assessment\n\nThe Chainlink oracle change has undergone auditing by Omniscia:\n[https://omniscia.io/reports/euler-finance-chainlink-support/](https://omniscia.io/reports/euler-finance-chainlink-support/)\n\nIt has also been reviewed by Sherlock:\n[https://www.hacknote.co/17c261f7d8fWbdml/1821f966f40pJG_t](https://www.hacknote.co/17c261f7d8fWbdml/1821f966f40pJG_t)\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThese changes will enable lenders to maintain their rewards while earning additional APYs from borrowers, while relying on a tried and tested Chainlink oracle. They will also pave the way for listing stETH as collateral and hopefully let Euler attract more liquidity and activity.\n\n## Relevant Links\n\nIR model github links:\n[https://github.com/euler-xyz/euler-contracts/pull/154](https://github.com/euler-xyz/euler-contracts/pull/154)\n\neIP 14 (Chainlink): \n[https://forum.euler.finance/t/eip-14-contract-upgrades/305#governance-5](https://forum.euler.finance/t/eip-14-contract-upgrades/305#governance-5)",

      "title": "eGP 1: Grant Request for Defishy.xyz to build Euler-specific liquidation risk dashboard",
      "content": "**Simple Summary**\nThe Defishy team is requesting a $8,000 grant to build an Euler-specific liquidation health dashboard on risk.euler.finance. This analytics platform will exist within the Euler ecosystem, enabling stakeholders within borrowing & lending ecosystems to manage liquidation cascade risk.\n\n**Abstract**\nThe Defishy team is composed of four members of Dartmouth Blockchain. Our philosophy is to continually provide value to the blockchain ecosystem through shipping useful products and research. The Defishy team consists of four individuals with development, design, and growth experience. We have extensive experience in DeFi, having contributed at Yeti Finance, Tribe DAO, Temple DAO, and more.\n\nThis liquidation dashboard will improve the Euler stakeholder/token holder experience by allowing users to identify wallets close to liquidation on Euler and position themselves accordingly. The recent crash of May 2022 was caused largely by a series of liquidation cascades as large whale wallets were liquidated. As liquidators sold massive amounts of collateral on exchanges, it dropped collateral price, which resulted in more liquidations. We created Defishy to democratize liquidation health data of all wallets, such that users are able to manage liquidation risk more effectively. We have built a similar dashboard for Aave, and after speaking with multiple members of the Euler team and users of Euler borrowing and lending, we think this integration will be beneficial.\n\n**Motivation**\nThere are a number of risk vectors in borrowing and lending protocols, including smart contract risk, price oracle manipulation risk, governance / pool management risk, and market risk (liquidations + bad debt). As protocols like Euler continue to onboard more users, it is increasingly important to equip users with necessary risk-management analytics for healthy activity. Safeguarding users against risk ensures the long-term sustainability of the protocol, as well as an improved user experience (competitive differentiation with other borrowing and lending protocols).\n\nProjects like [gov.gauntlet.network](http://gov.gauntlet.network) and [bad-debt.riskdao.org](https://bad-debt.riskdao.org/) have showcased what is possible with on-chain analytics for DeFi. On a longer term horizon, we hope to expand on previous projects in two ways: historical data and granular daily data. We will store various metrics (some already live at defishy.xyz), including Aggregate Liquidation Health, Total Collateral Value at Risk, Wallets at Risk, and more. Users will be able to monitor the historical trends of these metrics, while also viewing granular breakdowns of these metrics per day. See the following Figma mockups for reference: [mockup 1](https://www.figma.com/proto/i4ffPwQt79POQue2LSFumJ/Defishy?page-id=14%3A2&node-id=190%3A180&viewport=-2328%2C-2471%2C0.26&scaling=min-zoom), [mockup 2](https://www.figma.com/proto/i4ffPwQt79POQue2LSFumJ/Defishy?page-id=14%3A2&node-id=190%3A27&viewport=-2328%2C-2471%2C0.26&scaling=min-zoom) (we hope to execute this vision on a longer time horizon). We see Defishy as a useful public good for various stakeholders within the Euler ecosystem to manage risk: the DAO governors, users (borrowers and lenders), and researchers).\n\n**Specification & Implementation**\nWe are requesting an initial $8k grant to fund the development of integrating an Euler dashboard to Defishy.xyz, with the following deliverables:\n\n* Live metrics presented: Active Wallets, Wallets at Risk, and Aggregate Liquidation Score\n* Table view presented: Active Wallets (includes address, supply amount, borrow amount, and liquidation health)\n* Scatterplot graph view presented: Active wallets (includes liquidation health and wallet size visualization)\n\nThe deliverables will be live at risk.euler.finance.\n\nNext steps / To-do:\n1. Inspect smart contracts to figure out data pipeline setup\n2. Run nodes to scrape data from Euler protocol\n3. Upload data to backend (currently using Firebase)\n4. Apply Aave liquidation health metric to Euler wallets\n5. Make calls from frontend to display data\n6. Create frontend UI\n\nHow long will development take?\n* We estimate development time to take ~3 weeks from the proposal vote going though. Based on feedback from community members, we plan to continue iterating and shipping out new and useful features.\n\nWhat will the $8,000 be used for?\n* Database storage ($500)\n* Server hosting ($50)\n* Nodes ($450)\n* Contributor compensation ($7,000)\n\n**Voting**\n* Yes vote - Yes, fund $8,000 to Dartmouth Blockchain multisig (0x761DaE43C915914A681e15D17fd85603C78DEF5f) for 3 weeks of development work: liquidation health dashboard at defishy.xyz/protocols/euler\n* No vote - No, don’t fund $8,000 to Dartmouth Blockchain multisig (0x761DaE43C915914A681e15D17fd85603C78DEF5f) for 3 weeks of development work: liquidation health dashboard at defishy.xyz/protocols/euler",

      "title": "eIP 15: Reduce Reserve Factors and Amend Interest Rate Models",
      "content": "## Simple Summary\n\nThis proposal offers to reduce reserve factors on all cross and collateral assets, as well as to amend interest models. \n\n## Motivation\n\nThe motivation behind the proposal is to reduce the spread between the borrow and lending APYs. As of now, the spreads are way too wide even by DeFi standards: \n\n \n![7983c01746b0e7ffabbddb0ba2be4d64c8febde8.jpeg](ipfs://bafkreifvchxt5boa2gpcclw5suzucgrbocrqabocjboja3d3ajmg3w6ovq)\n    \n\nThe reason is two-fold:\n\n1. Reserve factor is too high\n2. Utilisation has gone down during market volatility\n\nOn (1), reserve factor of 0.23 means 23% of all the interest borrowers pay goes into reserves, ie lenders only get 77% of all the interest. This is arguably too much and lenders should be receiving more interest.\n\nOn (2), utilisation has decreased across the board as fewer people borrow from pools to liquidity mine $EUL. To illustrate:\n\n**USDC**:\n \n![92d854c629445207ef48005b2bd523d2aaa23964.png](ipfs://bafkreif6ralsbz7ebss3zg6b2iz6dhla722ov54bwc6777ixdz2zod67wy)\n\n\n**WETH**:\n\n \n![24162e61bdf7e92c2cca12a80504a130eb222282.png](ipfs://bafkreiah7sght2qjyznolvcytumj5n5dehn2dytihs2qgsg6musis2x4tq)\n    \n\n**DAI**:\n\n \n![cd91ab812964958d3c60a6ac34508bd6afb49889.png](ipfs://bafkreigmiweoe6lyt7sdszxdxcfdfdbddljvvdgrnhysyikac4cuxmamkm)\n    \n\n**WBTC**:\n\n \n![9024ba0b74808f110cf1c7d9f091505c1c9ba50f.png](ipfs://bafkreihr54mzqqds2fbft2jfrawhsb3wq7s56gyitmrdi5p5gzj3nnmj2i)\n    \n\nWhy does utilisation affect the spread? Because if the lending pool contains $1,000,000 and only $100 is borrowed, the interest the borrowers pay on $100 is distributed across $1,000,000 worth of lent assets. Alternatively, if the entire $1,000,000 is being borrowed, then lenders get a lot more interest on average.\n\nHow to address (2) then? Increase utilisation by moving the kink further out and/or lowering the interest rate around the kink. This way, your borrow vs lending APY spreads are reasonable even at high utilisation levels.\n\n## Implementation\nExact smart contract implementation will be posted shortly. \n\n### Current Model\n\n||Base IR|Kink IR|Max IR|Kink%|Reserve Factor|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|USDC|0%|4%|100%|80%|0.23|\n|WSTETH|0%|8%|200%|80%|0.10|\n|WETH|0%|4%|100%|80%|0.23|\n|DAI|0%|4%|100%|80%|0.23|\n|WBTC|0%|8%|200%|80%|0.23|\n|USDT|0%|20%|300%|80%|0.23|\n|AGEUR|0%|4%|100%|80%|0.23|\n|UNI|0%|20%|300%|80%|0.23|\n|LINK|0%|20%|300%|80%|0.23|\n|ENS|0%|20%|300%|80%|0.23|\n|MATIC|0%|20%|300%|80%|0.23|\n|OSQTH|0%|20%|300%|80%|0.23|\n|RBN|0%|20%|300%|80%|0.23|\n|SHIB|0%|20%|300%|80%|0.23|\n|MKR|0%|20%|300%|80%|0.23|\n|CVX|0%|20%|300%|80%|0.23|\n|PERP|0%|20%|300%|80%|0.23|\n|AXS|0%|20%|300%|80%|0.23|\n\n\n### New Model\n\n||Base IR|Kink IR|Max IR|Kink%|Reserve Factor|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|USDC|0%|1%|100%|80%|0.02|\n|WSTETH|0%|1%|200%|80%|0.02|\n|WETH|0%|1%|100%|80%|0.02|\n|DAI|0%|1%|100%|80%|0.02|\n|WBTC|0%|1%|200%|80%|0.02|\n|USDT|0%|1%|300%|80%|0.02|\n|AGEUR|0%|1%|100%|80%|0.02|\n|UNI|0%|1%|300%|80%|0.02|\n|LINK|0%|1%|300%|80%|0.02|\n|ENS|0%|1%|300%|80%|0.02|\n|MATIC|0%|1%|300%|80%|0.02|\n|OSQTH|0%|1%|300%|80%|0.02|\n|RBN|0%|1%|300%|80%|0.02|\n|SHIB|0%|1%|300%|80%|0.02|\n|MKR|0%|1%|300%|80%|0.02|\n|CVX|0%|1%|300%|80%|0.02|\n|PERP|0%|1%|300%|80%|0.02|\n|AXS|0%|1%|300%|80%|0.02|\n\n\n## Risk Assessment\nAssuming we only change the reserve factors to 0.02 without amending the interest rate models, we get the following improvement in lending APYs:\n|Asset|Current Utilisation|Current Borrow APY|Current Lending APY|New Borrow APY|New Lending APY|RF Improvement|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|USDC|51.07%|2.55%|1.00%|2.55%|1.28%|0.27%|\n|WSTETH|38.00%|3.80%|1.30%|3.80%|1.42%|0.12%|\n|WETH|45.45%|2.27%|0.80%|2.27%|1.01%|0.22%|\n|DAI|28.81%|1.44%|0.32%|1.44%|0.41%|0.09%|\n|WBTC|29.24%|2.92%|0.66%|2.92%|0.84%|0.18%|\n|USDT|20.95%|5.24%|0.84%|5.24%|1.08%|0.23%|\n|AGEUR|58.39%|2.92%|1.31%|2.92%|1.67%|0.36%|\n|UNI|32.26%|8.07%|2.00%|8.07%|2.55%|0.55%|\n|LINK|37.23%|9.31%|2.67%|9.31%|3.40%|0.73%|\n|ENS|44.58%|11.15%|3.83%|11.15%|4.87%|1.04%|\n|MATIC|10.27%|2.57%|0.20%|2.57%|0.26%|0.06%|\n|OSQTH|9.00%|2.25%|0.16%|2.25%|0.20%|0.04%|\n|RBN|73.39%|18.35%|10.37%|18.35%|13.20%|2.83%|\n|SHIB|7.87%|1.97%|0.12%|1.97%|0.15%|0.03%|\n|MKR|0.00%|0.00%|0.00%|0.00%|0.00%|0.00%|\n|CVX|43.47%|10.87%|3.64%|10.87%|4.63%|0.99%|\n|PERP|74.78%|18.70%|10.76%|18.70%|13.70%|2.94%|\n|AXS|0.00%|0.00%|0.00%|0.00%|0.00%|0.00%|\n\nThese are rather decent in % terms, especially on the more liquid assets like USDC, WSTETH and WETH.\n\nNext, if we amend the interest rate model WITHOUT changing the reserve factor.

However, given the current market conditions and lower demand for leveraging up and $EUL liquidity mining (as can also be seen on Aave and Compound), it's unlikely utilisation will persistently spike to unsustainable levels. \n\nEven if the market appetite for leverage massively increased over a short period of time, we can quickly propose more conservative kink models. At this point in the market, however, I think it's important Euler shows competitive interest rates with low spreads.\n\n## Conclusion\nLower RF and lower Kink IR will cause lower interest rates and tighter spreads between Borrow and Lending APYs, hence making Euler much more attractive for borrowing. The possible negative consequence is increase in average utilisation, which increases liquidity risk.\n\nGiven the current market conditions, it's unlikely we'll see spikes in utilisation. Hence we think it's appropriate to prioritise the tightening of spreads.",

      "title": "eIP 13: EUL distribution rules change",
      "content": "## Summary\n\nAs could be recently seen, the current permissionless EUL distribution system is prone to manipulation. Specific steps have to be taken to mitigate further manipulation attempts so that EUL tokens are distributed to the genuine users of the protocol. The proposal includes the requirement that only tokens present on the Coingecko-derived Euler token list at the time of the voting period start can take part in the EUL distribution system. The solution proposed is non-exhaustive, however simple to implement and if the proposal passes, the rules will be changed at the beginning of the next voting period.\n\n## Motivation\n\nWith EUL token launch, the gauges voting system has been opened to EUL holders so that anyone can stake their EUL and redirect distribution to their favourite markets. It was quickly proved that the proposed voting system has a drawback that makes it possible to redirect EUL distribution to fake tokens, created purposefully for that occasion. I still believe that the voting system makes the distribution more democratic, more likely to decentralize, and more likely to create value for lenders (through increasing interest rates) if the market for EUL distribution is free and fair. \n\nThe requirement that only tokens present on the Coingecko-derived Euler token list at the time of the voting period start can participate in the EUL distribution will make the system more robust while being easy to implement so that the rules new can be enforced at the beginning of the next voting period. The Coingecko-derived Euler token list is an open-sourced token list that contains tokens listed on Coingecko that are present on Ethereum and have liquidity against WETH on Uniswap v3. As of now, the list includes 1348 tokens of which 67 are currently listed on Euler. The list is updated daily. \n\nhttps://github.com/euler-xyz/euler-tokenlist/blob/master/euler-tokenlist.json \n\nI acknowledge the other proposals created by the community members. Ideas of voting participants incentivization, token supply threshold or certain oracle rank still need more discussion and/or are harder to be implemented at the moment. Hence, I propose to first vote and hopefully implement the token list requirement that should mitigate the manipulation risk the EUL distribution system is facing now, while the other proposals can be discussed and voted upon parallelly.\n\n## Specification\n \nOnly tokens present on the Coingecko-derived Euler token list at the time of the voting period start can take part in the EUL distribution.",

      "title": "eTP 1: Allocation of DAO Treasury to EUROC and WETH",
      "content": "\n## Summary\n\nProposal includes a near-term commitment to allocate $3 million of the $32.6 million raised in the recent treasury diversification event from USDC to EUROC and $1 million into WETH. These funds will be intended for securing Uniswap v3 oracles and laying the foundation for promoting EUROC to the collateral tier. This proposal paves the way to enabling on-chain EURUSD FX trading via Euler.\n\n## Motivation\n\nThe motivation behind allocating treasury funds to EUROC and WETH is three-fold:\n\n**1. Further treasury diversification into high-quality stablecoins**\n\nThe DAO holds a treasury that, until the recent funding round, consisted of approx 5.4m EUL tokens (approx 20% of the total EUL).\n\nUpon the treasury diversification funding round in early June, approx 9% of EUL were converted into USDC. After this event, the DAO now holds a treasury consisting of 2,468,672 EUL tokens (approx 9% of the total EUL) and about $32.6 million worth of USDC.\n\nShould the proposal pass, the DAO treasury will consist of:\n\n1. $3 million of EUROC\n2. $1 million of WETH\n3. $28.6 million of USDC\n4. 2,468,672 EUL (approx 9% of the total EUL)\n\nEUROC would partially hedge FX risk and further represent the global nature of Euler users and stakeholders. The Euro is the world’s second largest reserve currency, after the US dollar, and is used by at least 400 million people daily. For the DAO, EUROC is also advantageous given potential expenses such as grants and work from direct contributors based in the EMEA regions.\n\n**2. Providing EUROC Liquidity into Uniswap V3 to strengthen oracles**\n\nThe risk team will explore the best way to strengthen Uniswap V3 oracles while protecting the treasury funds from market risks. While the exact proposal for capital allocation will be handled in eTP 2, one possible allocation strategy could be:\n\n**A. Provide $2 million EUROC and $2 million USDC to the EUROC/USDC 5bps fee tier.**\n\nLiquidity split:\n\n1. 10% of liquidity provided full-range\n2. 20% of liquidity provided within 50% price range around spot price\n3. 70% of liquidity provided within 10% price range around spot price\n\n*Given EUR/USD trades within a tight band, it makes sense to allocate most of the funds around the spot price to generate trading fees and protect the oracle from multi-block attacks.*\n\n*While most of our analysis has focussed on 1-2 block attacks which require extreme price manipulation, multi-block attacks are less explored and potentially much more feasible. They require manipulation of oracles by a much smaller magnitude, which is why we believe it makes sense to deploy liquidity around a tighter band.*\n\n**B. Provide $1 million EUROC and $1 million WETH to the EUROC/WETH 5bps fee tier.**\n\nLiquidity split:\n\n1. 20% of liquidity provided full-range\n2. 50% of liquidity provided within 100% price range around spot price\n\n*We expect similar volatility from EUROC/WETH as from USDC/WETH, which is why allocating the liquidity around a much wider price band is appropriate. Nevertheless, the multi-block attack described earlier demands a more concentrated position as per our research.*\n\n**3. Paving the way to enabling on-chain EUR/USD trading via Euler and Circle**\n\nAssuming a strong pricing oracle and liquid on-chain FX markets, the risk team will be in a place to propose EUROC as a collateral asset on Euler. This would potentially enable Euler to capture a portion of the $6 trillion per day forex market.\n\nAn on-chain FX market has strong advantages vs TradFi FX markets:\n\n1. **Unified pricing feed**: FX pricing in TradFi is extremely fractured and arcane. Bringing that to a public ledger like Ethereum will allow for transparency not seen before in FX.\n2. **Limiting market manipulation**: given the public nature of blockchains, high-impact event-driven price manipulation would be substantially easier to track and prevent.\n3. **Weekend trading**: on-chain FX could allow traders to hedge weekend risk.\n4. **Enabling anyone to LP** into FX, not just the biggest market makers.\n5. **Opening FX to DeFi Natives** like DAOs that want to interact with DeFi, not TradFi. \n\nEuler is strongly positioned to enable this as, unlike competitors, it has an efficient position building engine. For eg, instead of lending EUROC, borrowing USDC, swapping into EUROC and recursively doing this in multiple steps, one could do the following:\n\n1. Deposit 1000 USDC as margin\n2. Mint 2000 eUSDC (assets), 2000 dUSDC (liabilities)\n3. Swap eUSDC into eEUROC\n\nHence, you’ll get:\n\n1. 1000 USDC margin\n2. 2000 dUSDC (short USDC)\n3. 1904 eEUROC (long EUROC, assuming 1.05 EUROC/USDC price)\n\nIn fact, one could post any collateral asset enabled on Euler as margin and put on a directional FX trade in one click.\n\nGiven Euler’s market-based liquidation module, users will lose less on average in the event of liquidations. This and the flexibility of the architecture makes Euler an institutional-grade solution for bringing FX flow on-chain.\n\n## Specification\n\n***1. How is EUROC different from USDC?***\n\nEUROC will be issued by Circle under the same full-reserve model like USDC.\n\n***2. Where will the euro reserves of EUROC be held?***\n\nCircle will hold Euro-denominated banking accounts at leading financial institutions, beginning with Silvergate Bank in the US.\n\n***3. What is Silvergate bank?***\n\nSilvergate is a leading bank in the realm of fintech and crypto. They operate the SEN (Silvergate Exchange Network), which allows clients to issue and redeem USDC and EUROC 24/7. All USDC and EUROC are fully redeemable 1:1 for fiat currency if desired.\n\n***4. Who audits EUROC?***\n\nGrant Thornton LLP will be issuing monthly attestations. Circle’s financial statements, which include EUROC reserves, are audited annually and filled with the SEC.\n\n***5. When will EUROC launch?***\n\nEUROC will launch on the 30th June, 2022.\n\n***6. What integrations are already in the making?***\n\nThe **DeFi** integrations underway include Compound, Curve, DFX, Uniswap.\n**Exchanges** include [Binance.US](http://binance.us/), Bitstamp, FTX and Huobi Global.\n**Custodians** include Anchorage Digital, CYBAVO, Fireblocks.\n**Wallets** include Ledger, Metamask institutional.\n\n***7. Which users is EUROC targeting?***\n\nEUROC is targeting exchanges, institutional traders, businesses and individuals. Judging by upcoming integrations, EUROC may become an integral part of DeFi and enable on-chain FX arbitrage. It could also become an integral part of other DAO treasuries, especially for teams based in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa.\n\n## Implementation\n\nIf eTP 1 is approved, the DAO will acquire $3 million worth of EUROC and $1 million worth of WETH via Uniswap, Curve or DFX at minimal market impact over the next few days.\n\n## Assessment\n\nGiven EUROC is based on exactly the same mechanism as USDC, which has proven itself as one of the most reliable DeFi assets, the risk of loss of funds for the DAO is limited. If this proposal is passed, it lays the foundations for potentially enabling EUROC as collateral on Euler, building an on-chain FX market, research collaborations between Circle and Euler, and more.\n\nRisk assessment of providing liquidity into Univ3 and EUROC as collateral will be handled in another proposal subject to eTP 1 being approved by token holders.\n\n## Vote\n\nThe vote for this will be conducted via Snapshot till 5 July 2022, 9am EST.
