      "content": "## Authors\n\nFrax Core Team\n\n# Summary\n\nThis proposal seeks to create a Karak Restaking AMO for the Frax Finance ecosystem. It proposes allocating up to $50 million worth of sfrxETH and sFRAX, and up to 5 million FXS from the protocol/community treasury, all to be restaked on the Fraxtal network.\n\n# Background and Motivation\n\nKarak is a cutting-edge restaking protocol designed to enhance yield generation by allowing users to restake their assets, such as staked ETH, across multiple validators and protocols. This enables participants to maximize returns while securing various decentralized services. Karak’s protocol offers increased capital efficiency and maintains a focus on security and liquidity for staked assets.\n\nKey features of Karak include:\n\n* Restaking for Higher Yields: Karak enables the compound yield of staked assets by restaking them across multiple validators and platforms.\n* Decentralization and Security: The protocol ensures security and decentralization, making it a reliable choice for stakers who want to maximize returns while minimizing risk.\n* Liquidity Flexibility: Karak allows restakers to maintain liquidity through liquid staking, making it easier for users to utilize their staked assets in other DeFi platforms.\n\nBy utilizing Karak’s restaking mechanism on the Fraxtal network, Frax Finance can diversify its yield strategies and improve returns on sfrxETH, sFRAX, and FXS, while also contributing to the liquidity and activity on the Fraxtal network. This integration aligns with Frax Finance’s long-term goal of expanding its ecosystem and enhancing the utility of its assets through innovative partnerships and strategies.\n\n# Proposal Details\n\nThis proposal seeks to:\n\n* sfrxETH: Authorize allocation of up to $50 million worth of sfrxETH to be restaked on the Karak protocol.\n* sFRAX: Authorize allocation of up to $50 million worth of sFRAX to be restaked on the Karak protocol.\n* FXS: Authorize the allocation of up to 5 million FXS from the Frax protocol/community treasury to be restaked on the Karak protocol. This allocation will not involve minting new FXS and will be fully drawn from the existing treasury, adhering to the FXS cap of 100 million. This proposal does not, in any way, alter the 100 million FXS cap, and all FXS allocated comes from within the established limits.\n* The allocation will be dynamically adjusted by the Frax Finance core team based on market conditions and yield performance, with regular reviews to ensure optimal returns for the Frax ecosystem and its treasury.\n\n## Karak Protocol links:\n\nDocs: https://docs.karak.network/\n\nDAPP: https://app.karak.network/\n\nX account: https://x.com/Karak_Network\n\nAudits: https://docs.karak.network/security/audits\n\n# Voting\n\n* For: Approve the creation of a Karak Restaking AMO with a maximum allocation cap of 50 million USD worth of sfrxETH, 50 million USD worth of sFRAX, and 5 million FXS, to be restaked on the Fraxtal network.\n\n* Against: Do nothing.",

      "content": "## Authors\n\nFrax Core Team\n\n# Summary\n\nThis proposal seeks to migrate the Snapshot voting process from the Ethereum mainnet to the Fraxtal network. By transitioning to Fraxtal, we aim to enhance the voting experience for the Frax community by leveraging Fraxtal’s advanced scalability and flexibility features.\n\n# Background and Motivation\n\nCurrently, Frax Finance conducts its Snapshot voting on the Ethereum mainnet. However, by leveraging Fraxtal’s infrastructure, we aim to optimize our governance experience and integrate more effectively with our ecosystem.\n\nMigrating Snapshot voting to Fraxtal will not only streamline our operations but also position Fraxtal as a central hub for governance activities. This move will allow us to accumulate voting power from both our veFXS holders on the mainnet and those on Fraxtal, creating a more unified and influential voting base. Additionally, by setting this precedent, we hope to encourage other projects to consider Fraxtal for their governance needs, further solidifying its role in the broader DeFi ecosystem.\n\n# Voting\n\n* **For:** Approve the migration of Snapshot voting from Ethereum mainnet to Fraxtal.\n* **Against:** Continue using Ethereum mainnet for Snapshot voting.",

      "title": "[FIP - 403] Create new sfrxEth/sFRAX Fraxlend Pair",
      "content": "**Authors:**\nMichael Henry\n\n**Summary:**\nPropose the creation of a new Fraxlend pair on the Ethereum Mainnet: sfrxETH/sFRAX\n\n**Details:**\n\n* **Fraxlend Pair Name 1:** sfrxETH/sFRAX\n* **Chain:** Ethereum Mainnet\n* **Max Loan-to-Value (LTV)**: 75%\n\n**Background and Motivation:**\nsFRAX is the yield-generating primitive of the Frax stablecoin and can be thought of as Frax’s cost of capital. Therefore, when lending sFRAX via AMO Frax Finance can be assured of profitability regardless of how much money it deposits in the pool.\n\n**Positives:**\n\n* **Guaranteed AMO Profitability:** As long as there are no liquidations that take on bad debt, Frax AMO’s will need less managing because FRAX lent into the pool will always be earning more than Frax’s cost of capital\n* **More liquidity:** For lenders, the sFRAX pools can be thought of as restaking lending pools that allow them to return additional yield on-top of the existing yield they’re already generating from sFRAX. As a result, I’d expect a decent portion of the $47m to be deposited as liquidity.\n* **Cheaper Borrowing:** Lower borrowing rates because the borrower doesn’t need to subsidize the entire unlent portion of the pool. All unlent sFRAX is still appreciating in value.\n\n**Negatives:**\n\n* **Reduced Fraxlend Revenue:** Fraxlend won’t profit off of the intrinsic borrowing cost associated with sFrax, so if the lending rate is functionally 8% Fraxlend will only earn fees on 8 – sFRAX Rate = 2%.\n* **Higher Gas Fees:** Borrowers will need to unwrap sFRAX for FRAX anytime they want to borrow money.\n* **Less Clear Borrowing Cost:** The real borrowing cost is abstracted from the user but this can be resolved in the future with a minor UI change.\n* **No Frax AMO Support:** Frax AMOs don’t directly support sFRAX but they are largely manually managed, so I don’t think the conversion should be problematic. If this is untrue, please let me know in the comments.\n* **Frax AMO impact on sFRAX yield:** The sFRAX contract does not have functionality to ignore a portion of minted sFRAX when distributing profits, so all AMO Minted sFRAX would receive a portion of profits reducing the underlying sFRAX yield. This could be offset on a 1-week behind basis by adding all profits held by unlent sFRAX back to the sFRAX contract.\n\n**Additional Details:** The Fraxlend Fees for sFRAX pools can be raised to account for the lower revenue if we want.\n\n**Liquidity Profile:**\nsFRAX is always losslessly convertible to FRAX, so it shares it’s liquidity profile. The Max LTV is identical to that of the sfrxEth pool, so that shouldn’t be a concern.\n\n**Curve Details:** To account for the underlying sFRAX yield, we’ll need to create a new significantly less step Curve. I would suggest a curve where the Borrow limit linearly increases from 0.5% to 4% until hitting 85% utilization, at which point if would mimic the behavior of the Variable 2 curve.\n\n**Closing Thoughts:**\n\nI believe that in the future a significant portion of debt will be denominated in term of the yield-generating primitive much like real-world loans are denominated in terms of SOFR, so we should try to get ahead of the curve.\n\n**Voting:**\n\n* **For:** Approve the creation of the sfrxETH/sFRAX Fraxlend pair on Ethereum Mainnet with new curve, and max LTV\n* **Against:** Do not approve the creation of the new Fraxlend pair.",

      "title": "[FIP - 399] A Frax Shopping Experience, Powered by Moso",
      "content": "### **What are Moso Shops?**\n\n[Moso Shops](https://moso.xyz/) is a platform that integrates token-based rewards into retail transactions, offering a unique way to enhance user engagement and power transactions across one’s ecosystem. The platform is designed to cater to both web2 and web3 users.\n\nIt enables users to shop at over 2000+ supported web2 retailers including Walmart, Marriott, and eBay to earn in the crypto asset of their choice. Additionally, Moso offers a custom, white-labeled shopping experience for web3 brands where users can earn up to 100% cash back or more exclusively in the ecosystem’s native token. For [Galxe Shop](https://shop.galxe.com/), the rewards are partially funded by both the merchant and Galxe. \n\nMoso has seen **$500,000+** in purchases, registered **100,000+** sign-ups, and distributed **$200,000+** in crypto rewards back to users. \n\nMoso aims to work directly with Frax to provide $FXS cash-back rewards in a Frax Shop, powered By Moso. \n\nWe’re thrilled about the opportunity to integrate deeply into the Frax ecosystem as the only retail shop to earn cash back experience fully distributed in $FXS.\n\n**How are the cash-back rewards distributed?**\n\nMoso requests a token allocation from Frax to boost cash back rates, on top of the fixed cash back rates paid to Moso by the Web2 merchants for driving purchases to these retailers.\n\nIncreased rates will only sometimes be available. Boosted cash back rates of as much as 100% back in $FXS at selected merchants will be deployed from time to time allowing users to find amazing shopping deals that they otherwise would not have access to. In this scenario, the rewards are partially funded by both the merchant and Frax.\n\nWhen boosted rates are not being deployed, web2 merchants distribute cash back to Moso. Moso converts the fiat cash-back to tokens on the backend for distribution to eligible users. In this scenario, the merchant fully funds the rewards. \n\nAmazingly, users will always be earning cash back in $FXS.\n### **How can a white-labeled shop benefit Frax?**\n\n- **Powering Transactions:**\n    - Increase user engagement and value.\n    - A great way to get new users onboarded to Frax and Fraxtal.\n- **Fiat Integration:**\n    - Seamless integration of fiat currency into tokens, enhancing token utility and value. Fiat retail purchases = $FXS rewards.\n- **Delayed Rewards:**\n    - Token lock-up during the payout period to maintain user interest.\n- **Retail Audience Focus:**\n    - Target a retail-heavy web2 and web3 audience, catching the attention of users interested in deals and rewards.\n    - Demonstrate that Frax is more than just a DeFi and L2 ecosystem.\n\n- **Web2 User Exposure:**\n    - Attract new holders and users from the traditional Web2 retail space.\n    - Discoverability of Frax and Fraxtal.\n- **Additional Token Utility:**\n    - Provide various incentives, allowing users to qualify for up to 100% cash back on purchases.\n    - Custom actions enable users to earn cash back and other rewards.\n    - Great option for ecosystem users who already shop online. Why not have them earn and hold your native token?\n    - Increase demand and liquidity.\n- **Crypto Back Offers:**\n    - Transactions on the protocol level can qualify users for $FXS cash back, driving further engagement.\n    - Frax will become the prime destination for crypto-based online shopping rewards.\n\n### **Moso’s game plan and execution**\n\nOur goal is to onboard new users to the Frax ecosystem, drive visibility to Frax as the leading DeFi and L2 ecosystem, and re-engage existing users all through Moso. Throughout all of this, Frax can identify valuable, active ecosystem users with a real-world use case. This data can be leveraged in any marketing campaign Frax executes moving forward to continue to capture market share among users.\n\nMoso plans to distribute loyalty points to users in parallel with the higher cash-back rates in $FXS. Loyalty points can be earned by users continuing to visit the Frax Shop to Earn page daily. To include additional gamification methods, points will also be distributed from purchases at retailers and for engaging with different Frax ecosystem dapps/DeFi integrations.\n\nMoso also acts as a gateway for users to discover Frax’s best applications and DeFi integrations. Moso will work with the Frax team to understand which applications to highlight on the Frax Shop alongside retailers.\n\nBy engaging with dapps and executing an on-chain action, the user will qualify for points and cash back. Cash-back rewards by engaging with Fraxtal dapps are TBD as that discussion will take place with the application since it revolves around the kickback the dapp can give in return for the conversion. This is the perfrect fit for dapps who already have a referral program in place or are in need of a referral program.\n\nEach shopping trip will power up to three on-chain transactions on Fraxtal for users engaging with the Frax Shop. Fraxtal would be the first L2 ecosystem to be fully integrated into Moso.\n\n- The user claims $FXS on Fraxtal through Moso to claim their cash back\n- The user claims points on-chain via Fraxtal as a reward on Moso\n- The user executes a transaction on a Fraxtal dapp through Moso\n\n### Exciting traction\n\n$500,000+ in purchases\n\n$200,000+ in rewards distributed to users\n\n100,000+ sign-ups\n\n### What Moso is proposing\n\n|Package|Standard|\n| --- | --- |\n|Allocation|$50k+ USD|\n|Fee|10% of the total token grant|\n|$FXS token added to chrome extension & web browser|Yes|\n|White-label shop|Yes|\n|Customer service & maintenance|Yes|\n|$FXS cash back claiming on Fraxtal blockchain|Yes|\n|Custom development for added functionality: Lock $FXS cash back tokens for increased rates Onboard ecosystem dapps to your Shop page Spend $FXS cash back tokens with web3 merchants|Yes|\n\n### **Project Links:**\n\n- Website: https://moso.xyz/\n- Twitter: https://x.com/MosoHQ\n- Discord: https://discord.com/invite/moso\n- Other: https://blog.moso.xyz/ (Medium) \n\n### **The ask from Frax DAO**\n\nMoso requests a token grant from Frax of up to $50K USD in $FXS to boost cash back rates, on top of the fixed cash back rates paid to Moso by the Web2 merchants for driving purchases to these retailers. \n\n### Poll\n\nFor: Create a white-labeled Frax Shop enabling users to claim cash-back in $FXS on Fraxtal by shopping at Moso’s 2,000 supported merchants. Moso requests a token grant from Frax of up to $50K USD in $FXS to boost cash-back rates on top of the web2 merchants' fixed cash-back rates being paid to Moso for driving purchases to these retailers.\n\n**Against:** Do nothing",

      "title": "[FIP-398] Frax AMO Integration on Morpho with USD0++/FRAX and Curve LP USD0/USD0++/FRAX as available markets",
      "content": "## Authors\n\nUsual, 0xloth (Morpho), MEV Capital Team\n\n# Summary\n\nThis proposal seeks to establish an Algorithmic Market Operation (AMO) utilizing Morpho for lending and liquidity management. Specifically, it aims to first integrate USD0++ ([0x35D8949372D46B7a3D5A56006AE77B215fc69bC0](https://etherscan.io/token/0x35D8949372D46B7a3D5A56006AE77B215fc69bC0)) and Curve LP USD0/USD0++ ([0x1d08e7adc263cfc70b1babe6dc5bb339c16eec52](https://etherscan.io/token/0x1d08e7adc263cfc70b1babe6dc5bb339c16eec52)) markets as collateral on Morpho to support Frax as borrowing assets, enhancing the utility and stability of both assets in the DeFi ecosystem.\n\n# Background and Motivation\n\n[Morpho](https://morpho.org/) is a decentralized, non-custodial lending protocol that optimizes yield for lenders and reduces borrowing costs for borrowers by having new rate computation functions. This integration aligns with our commitment to decentralization, transparency, and financial empowerment.\n\n[MEV Capital](https://mevcapital.com/) is a DeFi asset manager that already has more than $300M in assets under management and is already curator on Symbiotic and Mellow. Their knowledge in DeFi is now clearly established, making them a natural choice to curate Usual’s Morpho vaults. As such, MEV Capital will be at the disposal of Frax to co-curate the Frax AMO.\n\n[Usual](https://usual.money/) is a new decentralized stablecoins issuer that accepts RWAs as collateral ([USYC](https://usyc.hashnote.com/) by [Hashnote](https://www.hashnote.com/)). USD0++ is a liquid bond token that represents locked USD0, accruing pills (the points of Usual) over time. The USD0/USD0++ Curve LP market provides deep liquidity and low slippage for stablecoin swaps while also accruing pills and fees. By leveraging these assets as collateral within Morpho, we can create a more dynamic and robust lending environment, attracting larger borrowers and creating growth across our ecosystem.\n\n## Usual Materials:\n\n[Usual Audits](https://docs.usual.money/resources-and-ecosystem/audits#approach-to-audits): Usual employs a multi-phased audit program to achieve the highest level of protocol security. Code auditors are industry leading Spearbit and Cantina.\n\n[Usual Website](http://usual.money): All resources and links\n\n[Usual Docs](https://docs.usual.money/): Full explanation of the protocol\n\n[Usual Backers](https://docs.usual.money/resources-and-ecosystem/usual-backers): See all company and individuals that back Usual\n\n[Usual Collatera](https://docs.usual.money/usual-products/usd0-stablecoin/rwa-collateral)l: See Usual collateral and its specs\n\n[Usual Risk Policy](https://docs.usual.money/resources-and-ecosystem/usd0-risk-policy): See Usual risk policy and guidelines\n[Usual X](https://x.com/usualmoney): To see latest integration and news\n\nLive Usual Integrations:\n\n* [Morpho](https://app.morpho.org/vault?vault=0xd63070114470f685b75B74D60EEc7c1113d33a3D&network=mainnet)\n* [Pendle](https://app.pendle.finance/trade/points/0x00b321d89a8c36b3929f20b7955080baed706d1b?chain=ethereum)\n* [Balancer](https://balancer.fi/pools/ethereum/v2/0x9ed2dbe178f5720ed6085630d3a0b76ee2cd3ab20002000000000000000006aa)\n* [Curve](https://curve.fi/#/ethereum/pools/factory-stable-ng-189/deposit)\n\n# Proposal Details\n\nThis proposal involves minting FRAX and depositing it into a designated Morpho lending market (i.e USD0++/FRAX and CurveLP(USD0/USD0++)/FRAX). The goal is to provide sufficient liquidity for FRAX in order to overcome supply-side shortages in lending, thereby fostering growth on the borrowing side. By kickstarting the market for larger borrowers, we aim to create a more dynamic and robust lending environment for FRAX on Morpho and deeper connection in the short term with Usual. Oracle choice will be decided with the Frax team.\n\nUsual will incentivize the FRAX side with the same conditions as all other lending markets. (USD0++/USDC and CurveLP (USD0/USD0++)/USDC) Those pills will be given to the Frax Treasury. (1 pills per dollar + 5 bonus pills for each newly USD0++minted).\n\nThe markets have not been created yet and will be established in collaboration with the Frax team. The default parameter applied is a maximum of 86% LTV. After the integration, Usual will also create a FRAX/USD0 pool on Curve to simplify the loops.\n\n# Voting\n\n• For: Approve the Frax AMO integration with a max authorized allocation of 50,000,000 FRAX on MetaMorpho Vault. Also, initiating the vault as a borrowing source for the to be created USD0++/FRAX and CurveLP(USD0/USD0++)/FRAX Morpho-markets when those would be created.\n\n• Against: Do not proceed with the proposal.",

      "title": "[FIP - 397] Frax Finance Annual Budget Request (2024 - 2025)",
      "content": "### Authors\n\nFrax Core Team\n\n## Summary\n\nThis proposal seeks to authorize a revised maximum annual budget of **4,100,000 FRAX** for Frax Finance for the fiscal year 2024-2025. The revised budget reflects significant cuts across various categories to ensure financial prudence while continuing to support essential operations and initiatives. The budget is intended to cover four key categories: Development & Operation, Security, Legal & Compliance, and Fraxtal Growth under the Fraxtal Builders Program. Please note that this is a maximum cap, and it is highly likely that not all of it will be used, as we only spent 5,123,990 FRAX last year out of the 9,000,000 FRAX budget that we had during the last fiscal year.\n\n\n## Background and motivation\n\nAs Frax Finance continues to grow and evolve, this budget supports our core operations while enabling strategic growth within the Fraxtal ecosystem. The allocation focuses on maintaining our development and operational capacity, ensuring security, managing legal and compliance obligations, and selectively supporting key initiatives within the Fraxtal ecosystem.\n\n\n## Details\n\n### Budget Categories\n\n1. **Development and Operation:** This budget will be used to cover the costs associated with the development and operation of the Frax Finance protocol. This could include salaries for developers, costs of new feature development, maintenance costs, infrastructure costs, and other operational expenses.\n\n2. **Security (Audits and Bug Bounty):** This budget is allocated to maintaining the security of the Frax Finance protocol. This includes the costs of regular security audits by external firms, running a bug bounty program to incentivize the discovery and reporting of vulnerabilities and other measures to ensure the safety and trust of our community.\n\n3. **Legal and Compliance:** This budget covers legal and compliance costs to ensure that Frax Finance operates within the legal framework. This could include fees for legal counsel, regulatory compliance costs, potential legal disputes, and other related expenses. Notably, Frax Finance has not encountered any significant legal issues to date, and last year, we spent less than 5% of the allotted legal budget. This allocation remains in place to ensure we are prepared for any unforeseen legal requirements.\n\n4. **Fraxtal Ecosystem Grants (Fraxtal Builders Program):** This new budget category aims to support the growth of the Fraxtal ecosystem through the Fraxtal Builders Program. Although limited, this budget supports critical initiatives within the Fraxtal ecosystem, focusing on strategic growth and development. And it can be boosted by allocating Frax Finance grants from Superchain grant programs.\n\n### Budget Allocation\n\n||Budget Share Percentage|Proposed Budget (2024 - 2025)|Frax Finance Latest Annual Budget (2023 - 2024)|\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|Development and Operation|73.2%|$3,000,000|$3,000,000|\n|Security|9.8%|$400,000|$1,400,000|\n|Grants|0.0%|$0|$600,000|\n|Reserve Emergency Fund|0.0%|$0|$1,000,000|\n|Legal and Compliance|12.2%|$500,000|$3,000,000|\n|Fraxtal Ecosystem Grants|4.9%|$200,000|$0|\n||Total|$4,100,000|$9,000,000|\n\n### Additional Notes\n\n* This proposal represents the maximum caps for each category, not necessarily the exact amounts that will be used.\n* This proposal does not cover the costs of liquidity incentivization. Kindly refer to the [Votium](https://snapshot.org/#/frax.eth/proposal/0x606e06ce600e8f652ee04e2fdfb0ec11b09c78547d0eae3bf5bf8c9c5e214b28) and [WETHR](https://gov.frax.finance/t/fip-182-frxethbp-wethr-program/2097) proposals for budget allocations related to liquidity incentivization.\n* All previously approved budgets are still in effect and considered in our ongoing operations. This proposal is designed to supplement and build upon the existing financial strategies.\n* This proposal does not account for FXS. The team plans to continue utilizing their current treasury allotment of FXS for core development compensation. If more/less FXS resources become necessary in the future, a specific governance proposal will be initiated.\n\n## Vote\n\n* For: Authorize a maximum annual budget cap of 4.1M FRAX (2024 - 2025)\n* Against: Do nothing.",

      "title": "[FIP - 396] Adding LFXB2027 as an Option for Locked Liquidity Exit",
      "content": "## Authors\n\nFrax Core Team\n\n# Summary\n\nThis proposal seeks to provide liquidity providers within the Frax Finance ecosystem the option to exchange their locked liquidity in certain pools for timed locked Frax Bond 2027 ([LFXB2027](https://fraxscan.com/address/0xbAF15fA061d83608B7F59226b8491C1eb9DF48B2)) at the auction price.\n\n# Background and Motivation\n\nFollowing the success of [FIP 379](https://gov.frax.finance/t/fip-379-locked-liquidity-standard-exit/3145), which allowed LPs to exit their positions through a standard exit mechanism, there has been continued interest in providing additional options for liquidity providers who wish to exit their locked positions. To address this, we propose adding LFXB2027 as a new exit option, offering liquidity providers more flexibility while maintaining the integrity and stability of the Frax ecosystem.\n\n# Proposal Details\n\nThis approach offers liquidity providers a way to exit their positions while maintaining their investment within the Frax ecosystem, ensuring the protocol's stability and growth. The following points are important to note about this proposal:\n\n* **Pricing Based on Underlying Assets:** The pricing for the locked liquidity will be based on the current price of the underlying assets at the time of the exchange.\n* **Exchange with LFXB2027:** Locked liquidity can be exchanged for LFXB2027 at the auction price prevailing at the time of the exchange. An LP that wishes to migrate can sign the migration transaction on the Ethereum mainnet and move their LP token/NFT to the protocol to receive LFXB2027 tokens directly to the same address on the Fraxtal mainnet.\n* **Extra Option Alongside FXB2029:** It is important to emphasize that LFXB2027 is being introduced as an additional option. Liquidity providers still have the choice to exit their locked positions through FXB2029, ensuring that they can select the exit strategy that best suits their needs.\n* **Designated Locked Liquidity for Exchange:** Only certain designated pools will be eligible for this exchange option, but this list can be expanded through the governance process.\n\n|Pool|Gauge Address|\n| --- | --- |\n|Uniswap V3 FRAX/USDC|0x3EF26504dbc8Dd7B7aa3E97Bc9f3813a9FC0B4B0|\n|Uniswap V3 FRAX/DAI|0xF22471AC2156B489CC4a59092c56713F813ff53e|\n\n* **Option to Retain LPs:** Liquidity providers will have the option to either exchange their locked liquidity for FXB2029 or LFXB2027 or retain their current locked positions.\n* No Ragequit Fee: There will be no Ragequit fee for liquidity providers choosing this exchange method, ensuring a cost-effective transition.\n* **FXTL points:** Migrators that receive LFXB2027 for their positions will be entitled to all FXTL points multipliers for all LFXB2027 holders, making it a high-yield opportunity within the Frax ecosystem.\n* **TimedLocker for FXBs:** The TimedLocker allows liquidity providers to stake their FXB tokens in exchange for fixed-rate FXS rewards, with the total amount of FXB stakable being capped. Locked positions are transferable as vault tokens, enabling users to sell or transfer their stakes without waiting for the lock period to end. Once the set ending timestamp is reached, all positions become unlockable.\n\n# Voting\n\n* For: Approve the option for liquidity providers to exchange their locked liquidity for LFXB2027 at the auction price.\n* Against: Do nothing.",

      "content": "## **Author**\n@Westwood \n\n## **Summary**\nThe proposal aims to incorporate new market into Fraxlend on the Ethereum mainnet with the following specifications:\n\n| Collateral   | Asset | Rate Type         | Chain     | Max LTV | Treasury Authorization |\n|--------------|-------|-------------------|-----------|---------|------------------------|\n| sfrxETH         | USDT  | Variable Rate V2  | Ethereum  | TBD     | 10 Million             |\n\n## **Background and Motivation**\nThe proposal seeks to introduce new markets into Fraxlend on Ethereum, offering opportunities for borrowing assets like USDT, DAI, GHO, crvUSD, DOLA, and USDC with sfrxETH as collateral. As the Frax Finance protocol continues to evolve and expand, incorporating new markets will enhance its versatility and attract a wider user base.\n\n## **Partnerships and Ecosystem Growth**\nWhere necessary, we propose bootstrapping the pools with treasury-owned liquidity. By utilizing treasury assets to provide initial liquidity, we can ensure immediate and robust liquidity for the new markets, maintain better control and stability within the pools, and align incentives more closely with the long-term health and stability of the Frax ecosystem.\n\nIn addition to using treasury-owned liquidity, we are actively seeking to fill any gaps by expanding partnerships with the protocols that issue the assets. By collaborating directly with these protocols, we aim to foster a positive sum environment that benefits all parties involved. This approach includes having asset providers natively issue their stablecoins on Fraxlend, enhancing market depth and liquidity, and ensuring a steady supply of stablecoins to meet market demand.\n\nBy focusing on stablecoins with similar ethos, sufficient demand, and liquidity, we ensure that we align with projects that share our values and vision, while also providing reliable and liquid markets for our users.\n\n## **Options**\n- **For:** Deploy mentioned lending pair on Fraxlend in Ethereum mainnet\n- **Against:** Do nothing",

      "title": "[FIP - 387] Create ezETH/FRAX Fraxlend Pair on Ethereum Mainnet and Authorize AMO Allocation",
      "content": "## Authors:\n@Westwood\n\n## Summary\nPropose the creation of a new Fraxlend pair on the Ethereum mainnet: ezETH/FRAX.\n\n## Details\n- **Fraxlend Pair Name:** ezETH/FRAX - Variable Rate V2\n- **Chain:** Ethereum Mainnet\n- **Max Authorized Allocation:** 10,000,000 FRAX\n- **Max Loan-to-Value (LTV):** To be decided by the development team. \n\n## Background and Motivation\nFraxlend is a lending platform that enables the creation of markets between pairs of ERC-20 tokens. Each pair functions as an isolated, permission-less market, allowing users to engage in lending and borrowing activities. This protocol is designed to generate new financial opportunities for the FRAX community.\n\nAutomated Market Operations (AMOs) enhance FRAX’s capabilities as a leading stablecoin protocol by offering maximum flexibility and opportunities without compromising its core stability mechanisms. To date, multiple AMOs have been deployed on platforms such as Fraxlend, Aave, and Rari.\n\nIntroducing the ezETH/FRAX pair into the Fraxlend AMO on Ethereum Mainnet aligns with this strategic vision. It will facilitate the minting of FRAX, secured by over-collateralized debt, further strengthening the ecosystem. The choice of ezETH as an asset is based on its growing popularity and liquidity, which can attract a broader user base to Fraxlend. Allowing the development team to decide the LTV ensures that the risk parameters are set appropriately based on market conditions and risk assessments.\n\n## Liquidity Profile\nThe liquidity profile of the ezETH token is a crucial factor in the decision to introduce the ezETH/FRAX pair. The following image shows the slippage curve for ezETH, illustrating how liquidity impacts trading:\n\n![ezETH Liquidity|690x203](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard11/uploads/frax1/original/2X/9/908e268a9dc344b94d5c1f75c9f9133b7215bc40.jpeg)\n\n\nThis curve indicates that ezETH has a significant liquidity pool, which helps maintain stability and reduce slippage during large trades. A robust liquidity profile is essential for minimizing risks and ensuring the smooth functioning of the Fraxlend pair.\n\n## Why Adding ezETH to Fraxlend is Beneficial\n\nAdding ezETH to Fraxlend brings significant benefits to the platform and its users. As the second highest restaking token by market cap according to CoinGecko, ezETH offers a robust liquidity profile and strong market interest. This high liquidity ensures stability and minimizes slippage during large trades, making ezETH an attractive asset for lending and borrowing activities.\n\nMoreover, the growing adoption of ezETH in the DeFi space underscores its reliability and potential for high yield opportunities. By integrating ezETH into Fraxlend, the platform can attract a broader user base, enhance its market offerings, and support the overall growth and diversification of the Frax ecosystem.\n\n\n## Voting\n- **For:** Approve the creation of the ezETH/FRAX Fraxlend pair on Ethereum Mainnet with the specified max authorized allocation and allow the development team to decide the LTV.\n- **Against:** Do not approve the creation of the new Fraxlend pair.",

      "content": "## Authors\n\nFrax Core Team\n\n### Authors\n\nFrax Core Team\n\n## Summary\n\nDeploy Fraxferry for sFRAX, FRAX, FXS between Fraxtal and TRON, with the following details :\n\n![|624x212](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard11/uploads/frax1/original/2X/4/406e5924628a7084a23d008980eb0381da80ec8b.png)\n\n## Background and Motivation\n\nThe TRON public chain, a decentralized blockchain network based on the Tron protocol, has served as the core of the Tron ecosystem since its launch on June 25th, 2018. TRON has become a significant player in the stablecoin market, with a total value locked (TVL) reaching an all-time high of $58 billion ( [DefiLlama](https://defillama.com/stablecoins/Tron) ), primarily driven by USDT. The absence of both stablecoin alternatives and USD yield-bearing assets on TRON presents a great opportunity for FRAX and sFRAX to shine in this market. FRAX can offer a stable, decentralized alternative to USDT, while sFRAX can meet the demand for yield-bearing assets, providing users with more options for earning returns on their holdings.\n\nFraxferry aims to simplify the cross-chain bridging issue for assets, making it easier to deploy Frax-related tokens on other chains. Frax Ferry is a slower, simpler, but more secure method of bridging tokens. And you can read more about it [here](https://docs.frax.finance/fraxferry/overview).\n\n## Proposal\n\n* For: Deploy Fraxferry for sFRAX, FRAX, FXS between Fraxtal and TRON\n\n* Against: Do nothing.",

FXBs are debt tokens denominated in FRAX stablecoins, not a claim on any other asset or collateral. FXBs allow the formation of a yield curve to price the time value of lending FRAX back to the protocol itself.\n\nFraxlend is a lending platform that allows anyone to create a market between a pair of ERC-20 tokens. Each pair is an isolated, permission-less market that allows anyone to create and participate in lending and borrowing activities. This protocol is creating new financial opportunities for the FRAX community.\n\nAutomated Market Operations (AMOs) make FRAX one of the most potent stablecoin protocols, creating maximum flexibility and opportunity without altering the base stability mechanism that made FRAX a leader in the stablecoin space. So far, we have deployed multiple AMOs, including lending AMOs on the Fraxlend, Aave, and Rari protocols.\n\nAdding new FXBs is beneficial as it expands the FRAX ecosystem's offerings, enhances liquidity, and provides users with additional tools for managing risk and optimizing investment strategies. Adding more pairs into Fraxlend AMO is the next step in this vision, allowing the protocol to mint FRAX backed by over-collateralized debt.\n\n# Voting\n\n* For: Authorize the issuance of FXB20271231 with a 30 million cap and authorize Fraxlend AMO to deposit minted FRAX into the specified Fraxlend pair with the mentioned max authorized allocation.\n\n* Against: Do nothing.",

      "title": "[FIP - 383] Update frxETH Curve AMO",
      "content": "## Authors\n\nFrax Core Team\n\n# Summary\n\nThis proposal seeks to add two new asset types, ezETH and pzETH, to the assets that the frxETH Automated Market Operations (AMO) can hold and to allocate a portion of the frxETH AMO funds within the Fraxtal network. The goal is to enhance diversification, optimize returns, and support the growth of the Fraxtal network.\n\nThe proposed allocation caps for frxETH Curve AMO are:\n\nCurrent Asset Allocation:\n\n* ETH, WETH: Max 100% Min 50%\n* wstETH, stETH: Max 50% Min 0%\n\nProposed Asset Allocation:\n\n* ETH, WETH: Max 100% Min 0%\n* wstETH, stETH: Max 100% Min 0%\n* ezETH, pzETH: Max 20% Min 0%\n\nThis means the team can allocate up to the specified maximum percentages to the respective pools if deemed advantageous.\n\nIt is important to clarify that the min/max caps specified in this proposal are separate from the \"withholding ratio.\" The caps are not intended to suggest that we are directing 100% of all ETH minted from frxETH to the AMO. The withholding ratio of ETH is a separate parameter. These max/min caps are put in place to govern the portion of the withheld ETH that will be allocated to the pools within the AMO. more information about the current frxETH balance sheet can be found in [Frax Facts](https://facts.frax.finance/frxeth/balance-sheet).\n\n# Background and Motivation\n\nAutomated Market Operations (AMO) make Frax Finance one of the most potent stablecoin protocols, creating maximum flexibility and opportunity without altering the base stability mechanism. In Frax Ethereum, most of our Protocol Owned Liquidity (POL) resides on Curve, so setting clear allocation caps is crucial for managing our liquidity effectively and transparently in frxETH Curve AMO.\n\nAdding ezETH and pzETH to the portfolio offers significant value by providing another assets that aligns with our goals of optimizing returns and enhancing liquidity. Additionally, allocating a portion of the frxETH AMO within the Fraxtal ecosystem will support its growth and provide necessary liquidity, fostering innovation and activity on Fraxtal.\n\n## About ezETH\n\nezETH is a liquid restaking token representing a user’s restaked position at [Renzo](https://app.renzoprotocol.com/restake). Users can deposit native ETH or LSTs and receive ezETH. It is a reward-bearing token similar to cTokens, and the underlying restaking positions earn rewards reflected in the ezETH price. Rewards are expected in ETH, USDC, and Actively Validated Services (AVSs) reward tokens. This means the value of ezETH increases relative to the underlying LSTs as it earns more rewards in AVS tokens. Withdrawals take at least 7 days due to EigenLayer unstaking requirements, and transfers are facilitated through supplying liquidity or selling ezETH on [Balancer](https://app.balancer.fi/#/ethereum/pool/0x596192bb6e41802428ac943d2f1476c1af25cc0e000000000000000000000659).\n\n## About pzETH\n\npzETH is a liquid restaking token representing a user’s restaked position within the Symbiotic ecosystem. Users can deposit stETH, wstETH, wETH, or ETH to receive pzETH. It offers a higher yield than traditional ETH staking by securing Actively Validated Services (AVSs) through restaking. pzETH can be withdrawn from day one and is fully redeemable for the underlying restaked collateral.\n\n# Proposal Details\n\n* Authorize Holding ezETH: Allow the frxETH AMO to hold ezETH as one of its asset types.\n* Set Allocation Caps: Establish the following maximum and minimum allocation caps for the frxETH AMO:\n  * ETH/WETH Pools: Max 100%, Min 0%\n  * wstETH/stETH Pools: Max 100%, Min 0%\n  * ezETH/pzETH Pools: Max 20%, Min 0%\n* Deploy Assets on Fraxtal: Allocate a portion of the frxETH AMO to be deployed within the Fraxtal ecosystem. The specified allocation caps for ETH, WETH, wstETH, stETH, ezETH, and pzETH pools also apply to assets deployed in Fraxtal. For assets on Fraxtal, the Fraxtal native bridge will be used for WETH, stETH, and wstETH, while the Hyperlane bridge will be used for ezETH and pzETH.\n\n# Voting\n\n* For: Authorize frxETH AMO to add ezETH and pzETH as assets and allocate funds in curve pools based on the mentioned max and min authorized asset allocations.\n* Against: Do nothing.",

      "content": "**Authors:**  \n@Westwood\n\n---\n\n## Summary\nPropose the creation of a new Fraxlend pair on the Ethereum mainnet: PEPE/FRAX.\n\n---\n\n## Details\n\n- **Fraxlend Pair Name:** PEPE/FRAX - Variable Rate V2\n- **Chain:** Ethereum Mainnet\n- **Max Authorized Allocation:** 1,000,000 FRAX\n- **Max Loan-to-Value (LTV):** To be decided by the development team\n\n---\n\n## Background and Motivation\n\nFraxlend is a lending platform that enables the creation of markets between pairs of ERC-20 tokens. Each pair functions as an isolated, permission-less market, allowing users to engage in lending and borrowing activities. This protocol is designed to generate new financial opportunities for the FRAX community.\n\nAutomated Market Operations (AMOs) enhance FRAX’s capabilities as a leading stablecoin protocol by offering maximum flexibility and opportunities without compromising its core stability mechanisms. To date, multiple AMOs have been deployed on platforms such as Fraxlend, Aave, and Rari.\n\nIntroducing the PEPE/FRAX pair into the Fraxlend AMO on Ethereum Mainnet aligns with this strategic vision. It will facilitate the minting of FRAX, secured by over-collateralized debt, further strengthening the ecosystem. The choice of PEPE as an asset is based on its growing popularity and liquidity, which can attract a broader user base to Fraxlend. Allowing the development team to decide the LTV ensures that the risk parameters are set appropriately based on market conditions and risk assessments.\n\n---\n\n## Liquidity Profile\n\nThe liquidity profile of the PEPE token is a crucial factor in the decision to introduce the PEPE/FRAX pair.

      "title": "[FIP - 379] Locked Liquidity Standard Exit",
      "content": "## Authors\n\nFrax Core Team\n\n# Summary\n\nThis proposal seeks to provide liquidity providers within the Frax Finance ecosystem the option to exchange their locked liquidity in certain pools for Frax Bond 2029 **(FXB2029)** at the auction price.\n\n# Background and Motivation\n\nMany liquidity providers within the Frax Finance ecosystem have recently expressed a need for a ragequit or exit mechanism for their locked liquidity in FXS gauges. To address this concern and provide a flexible solution, we propose an exchange option to migrate the locked liquidity to FXBs, specifically FXB2029. This provides immediate liquidity to exit LPs starting with the older gauges while also keeping TVL within the Frax & Fraxtal ecosystem, an overall value add for all parties. FXB2029 tokens are liquid with high incentives for liquidity providers, massive FXTL points boosts, and migrators can exit these tokens should they want to leave the ecosystem for any reason by selling them on-chain in Curve pools and other venues and in no way required to hold them until maturity.\n\nFXB tokens are simple, trustless tokens that resemble a zero-coupon bond that converts to the FRAX stablecoin on maturity. FXBs are debt tokens denominated in FRAX stablecoins, not a claim on any other asset or collateral. FXB tokens are only convertible to FRAX stablecoins; they do not guarantee FRAX peg, FRAX value, or yield/interest denominated in any other asset except FRAX.\n\nBy migrating to FXBs, liquidity providers will have an alternative means to manage their deployed capital within the Frax ecosystem, providing them with the flexibility they have requested while ensuring the protocol maintains its needed locked liquidity.\n\n# Proposal Details\n\nThis approach offers liquidity providers a way to exit their positions while maintaining their investment within the Frax ecosystem, ensuring the protocol's stability and growth. The following points are important to note about this proposal:\n\n* **Pricing Based on Underlying Assets:** The pricing for the locked liquidity will be based on the current price of the underlying assets at the time of the exchange.\n* **Exchange with FXB2029:** Locked liquidity can only be exchanged for FXB2029 at the auction price prevailing at the time of the exchange. The auction price has a floor price of .794 at the time of this proposal & it is expected to remain at this floor price. An LP that wishes to migrate can sign the migration transaction on the Ethereum mainnet and move their LP token/NFT to the protocol to receive FXB2029 tokens directly to the same address on the Fraxtal mainnet. They are then free to do whatever they wish with their FXB2029 tokens.\n* **Designated Locked Liquidity for Exchange:** Only certain designated pools will be eligible for this exchange option, but this list can be expanded through the governance process.\n\n|Pool|Gauge Address|\n| --- | --- |\n|Uniswap V3 FRAX/USDC|0x3EF26504dbc8Dd7B7aa3E97Bc9f3813a9FC0B4B0|\n|Uniswap V3 FRAX/DAI|0xF22471AC2156B489CC4a59092c56713F813ff53e|\n\n* **Option to Retain LPs:** Liquidity providers will have the option to either exchange their locked liquidity for FXB2029 or retain their current locked positions.\n* **No Ragequit Fee:** There will be no Ragequit fee for liquidity providers choosing this exchange method, ensuring a cost-effective transition.\n* **FXTL points & incentives:** Migrators that receive FXB2029 for their positions will be entitled to all FXTL points multipliers & yield opportunities that are available and upcoming for all FXB2029 holders, making it one of the most high-yield opportunities within the Frax ecosystem.\n\n# Voting\n\n* For: Approve the option for liquidity providers to exchange their locked liquidity for FXB2029 at the auction price.\n* Against: Do nothing.",

The more work done, the better the token choice. For example on Curve the fee token was originally 3Crv LP token. This was because having deeper liquidity on 3Crv was a major source of protocol fees.  Curve has now switched to crvUSD as each crvUSD in distribution is equivalent to a crvUSD being lent out and creating fees.\n\nOne possible choice for Frax could be sFrax. sFrax does a lot of work for the user, but not all that much is gained on the protocol level. This can be an okay tradeoff though if claiming continued to be on mainnet since gas costs are higher and thus times to claim could be much longer for most users.\n\nOn Fraxtal however, gas costs are much less of an issue. Thus reward tokens should be more oriented for Protocol work. This is both good for the user in an indirect way, as well as users can withdraw and convert to something more oriented for their yield whenever they want.\n\nThe best asset choice for the protocol to issue would thus be an FXB. The protocol makes revenue in the background while the frax is waiting to be matured. If users claim and convert the FXB on the market, the protocol still has the underlying working. FXBs themselves also are yield bearing for the user (albeit at probably a slower rate than sFrax).\n\nThis proposal seeks to change veFXS revenue to be distributed as a wrapped version of the FXB20291231 issued on Fraxtal. The FXS buyback as part of the FLE system will stay the same.\n\nThe wrapper for this token will automatically use the underlying FXB as collateral in FraxLend and borrow frax for sFrax if interest rates are profitable. Users will gain compounded FXB tokens and can withdraw at any time.  FraxLend AMO will also gain some interest by lending to the FraxLend pair.\n\nWrapper can be found here (https://github.com/convex-eth/frax-cvx-platform/blob/main/contracts/contracts/fraxtal/cvxFXB.sol) and is currently under audit. Audit must be cleared to satisfactory levels before being used as the veFXS reward token.\n\nAs of note, the wrapper will contain a migration function to move underlying fxb to a different fxb type. The admin role for setting this migration will be held by the Frax comptroller multisig or Frax Governance.\n\nAlso the current name of the token (cvxFXB) is subject to change if we or the Frax team decide on something better before deployment.\n\n# Fees\nThere will be a standard market fee of 10% as a management fee.\nThis fee is only applied to revenue gained via the borrowing aspect of the wrapper and in no way applies to underlying vefxs rewards.\n\n# Voting\n\n  For: Change veFXS reward token distribution to the cvxFXB FXB wrapper.\n  Against: Do nothing.",

Symbiosis finance can facilitate cross-chain liquidity on a limitless basis where token pairs across different blockchains guarantee that they provide the best price for swapping their asset between any two arbitrary token pairs owing to constant monitoring.\n\nSymbiosis is a portfolio company of **Binance Labs, DWF Labs, Blockchain. com, Spartan Group** and more investors.\n\nList of chain supported on Symbiosis:\n\n* Tron\n* Ethereum\n* native Bitcoin\n* Polygon\n* zkSync Era\n* Base\n* Mantle\n* BNB\n* Polygon zkEVM\n* Linea\n* Arbitrum One\n* Arbitrum Nova\n* Avalanche\n* Scroll\n* Optimism\n* BOBA ETH\n* BOBA BNB\n* KAVA\n* Telos\n* Manta\n* Metis\n* Merlin\n* Rootstock\n* zkLink\n* Mode\n* Blast\n* SEI\n* Taiko\n* Core DAO\n\n#### Summary:\n\nSymbiosis is asking for an amount of liquidity from FRAX DAO to deploy FRAX Octopool (Symbiosis singe-sided cross-chain pool) among different chains to provide the ability to move FRAX among all supported chains including Fraxtal.\n\nCurrently Symbiosis has 6 type of Octopools across 30 chains:\n\n* Stable (includes USDT and USDC)\n* ETH (Includes wETH)\n* BTC (Includes wBTC, BTCB, RBTC…)\n* SIS\n* LADYS\n* pufETH\n\nAll pools can be checked here: [Symbiosis ](https://app.symbiosis.finance/liquidity-v2/pools)\n\nSymbiosis is looking to deploy FRAX Octopool among 6 supported chains: Ethereum, Arbitrum One, Avalanche, Polygon POS, Fraxtal.\n\nBesides that, Symbiosis will integrate Fraxtal as a new chain on Symbiosis and deploy wETH pool there where Symbiosis will provide their own liquidity.\n\nOn top of that, Symbiosis will connect 1inch, OpenOcean, Izumi and other DEXs to provide routing to get any assets on those chains including frxETH, sfrxETH, FPI, sFRAX and others.\n\nSymbiosis partners such as Li. fi (Jumper), Socket (Bungee), Rubic, Rango, OKX DEX and more will be able to integrate these pools for FRAX cross-chain transfers between different chains.\n\nBenefits for FRAX and Fraxtal:\n\n1. Symbiosis will provide solution to easily move FRAX between all popular chains similar how Circle CCTP works\n2. Symbiosis will integrate Fraxtal a new chain and connect it to 30 chains that we support\n3. Symbiosis will create wETH on Fraxtal and add their own liquidity there\n4. Symbiosis will be core provider in Li. fi (Jumper) OP-stack chains cross-chain campaign\n5. Symbiosis will connect FRAX Octopool with all popular on-chain aggregators and DEXs on chains supported by FRAX Octopool\n6. Symbiosis partners such as Li. fi (Jumper), Socket (Bungee), Rubic, Rango, OKX DEX will be able to use this liquidity in their systems and apps\n\n#### Proposal Details:\n\nSymbiosis is asking for initial liquidity that should be provided in these single-sided liquidity pools:\n\n* FRAX Ethereum pool: $80,000 of FRAX\n* FRAX Polygon POS pool: $50,000 of FRAX\n* FRAX Arbitrum One pool: $50,000 of FRAX\n* FRAX Fraxtal pool: $80,000 of FRAX\n\nBelow you can see how it will look like:\n\n![](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard11/uploads/frax1/original/2X/a/a045985a9eaf041343732fef6a2525cbfe82c79a.png)\n\n#### Integration Roadmap:\n\n1. - Whitelist FRAX token on Ethereum, Polygon POS, Arbitrum One and create to [Octopool](https://docs.symbiosis.finance/crosschain-liquidity-engine/symbiosis-octopool) (cross-chain pool)\n2. Configure the relayers network to handle requests from Fraxtal in multi-chain mode\n3. Connect Fraxtal to Symbiosis front-end, API and SDK\n4. Integrate wETH and FRAX pools on Fraxtal. Add Fraxtal to FRAX Octopool and wETH to ETH Octoopool\n5. - Integrate Fraxtal DEX for any-to-any routing on Symbiosis in main app.\n\n- Integrate 1inch and OpenOcean to FRAX Octopool on Ethereum, Polygon POS, Arbitrum One\n\n6. Launch marketing campaign (cross-chain quest) with Li. fi to popularize cross-chain swaps to Fraxtal and FRAX\n7. Ask Symbiosis partners to integrate Fraxtal to their protocols and apps\n\n**Symbiosis benefits:**\n\n1. Any-to-any tokens swaps (E.g. users will be able to swap any token from chain A to any token on Fraxtal)\n2. Integrated by Li. fi; Socket; Rubic; DODO; Etherdrops and more. All of these aggregators will be able to integrate Fraxtal and FRAX pools through Symbiosis\n3. More than 30 chains integrated including all popular L2s and L1 chains\n4. On-chain swaps supported through on-chain DEXs and aggregators\n5. Opportunity to provide liquidity and earn additional APR on Fraxtal\n6. Low fees and fast transaction speed\n\n# Vote\n- For: Allocate 260k FRAX as initial liquidity for Octopool\n- Against: Do nothing",

      "content": "## Summary\n\nThis proposal advocates for the allocation of Frax Protocol-Owned-Liquidity (POL) on Balancer v2 on Fraxtal. Frax will deposit into Balancer with the ability to stake their pool tokens in their preferred rewards contracts (e.g. Aura).\n\n|Pool|Address|Child Gauge|Root Gauge|Max Allocation|\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|sFRAX / sDAI|0xA0b92B33BeafcE388Ce0092afDcd0cA77323Eb12|0x34E040bC0342EbBfBC7a6306EB1B8E6579185c94|0x58e71Af9CE4378b79dAAf2C4E7be9765c442dFC2|$15,000,000|\n|FRAX / USDe|0xa0Af0B88796C1aA67e93db89FEAd2Ab7aA3D6747|0xf99d875Dd868277cf3780f51D69c6E1F8522a1e9|0x259371cA8AC5E7F3163704Ce58B0dA58820173ed|$15,000,000|\n|sFRAX / sUSDe / sDAI|0x33251abeCb0364Df98a27A8D5d7b5CCddc774c42|0x275e8514b83479f526673327B279753aBC666a05|0xEA8Ba6b0cB5908A5d803b01CeAea5a6E65D33508|$15,000,000|\n|sFRAX / sfrxETH|0x1570315476480fA80ceC1FFF07A20c1df1aDfD53|0x71c365fB739faFdba44B1564558849216de69958|0x5f0a99997ab2AcC5097dc5349aDF6985761336ac|$10,000,000|\n\nAs members of the Frax team have mentioned, Fraxtal’s vision is to become the ‘M2 chain’ (e.g. yield bearing assets such as sFRAX are native and foundational), whereas Ethereum mainnet is akin to an ‘M1 chain’ (e.g. ETH isn’t inherently yield bearing). Balancer has solidified its position as a primary liquidity hub for yield bearing assets across the EVM ecosystem evident with over [$500m in LST and LRT TVL](https://dune.com/balancer/lst). Its unique, yet battle-tested, AMM design makes Balancer well positioned to support Fraxtal as an integral part of Fraxtal’s liquidity layer for both yield bearing assets and core strategic liquidity.\n\nWhile Balancer and Frax have a longstanding and meaningful relationship, this proposal further solidifies that relationship for the betterment of both protocols by establishing the Balancer AMO on Fraxtal with the authorization of Frax POL for certain initial strategic pools on Balancer.\n\n## Proposal Details\n\nAllocate a portion of Frax’s POL of sfrxETH, sFRAX, sDAI, FRAX, USDe, and sUSDe into Balancer pools on Fraxtal. The sFRAX / sDAI, sFRAX / sUSDe / sDAI, and sFRAX / sfrxETH pools will be considered [core pools on Balancer.](https://docs.balancer.fi/concepts/governance/protocol-fees.html#core-pool-fee-redirection)\n\nAll four pools will be eligible for BAL and AURA rewards.\n\n## Voting\n\n* For: Authorize Frax to allocate the specified POL in Balancer Pools on Fraxtal\n* Against: Do nothing",

      "content": "#### Authors:\n\nSymbiosis Core team\n\n#### Background:\n\nSymbiosis is one of the leading cross-chain solutions within the market and it offers a decentralized environment ensuring multichain liquidity protocol, which provides its users with features like swapping digital assets between multiple chains without changing the owners of the funds.\n\nThe platform is non-custodial and has a simple interface which makes it user-friendly and users can participate in consensus and sign transactions by staking SIS tokens to run a node within the relayer network. Symbiosis finance can facilitate cross-chain liquidity on a limitless basis where token pairs across different blockchains guarantee that they provide the best price for swapping their asset between any two arbitrary token pairs owing to constant monitoring.\n\nSymbiosis is a portfolio company of **Binance Labs, DWF Labs, Blockchain. com, Spartan Group** and more investors.\n\nList of chain supported on Symbiosis:\n\n* Tron\n* Ethereum\n* native Bitcoin\n* Polygon\n* zkSync Era\n* Base\n* Mantle\n* BNB\n* Polygon zkEVM\n* Linea\n* Arbitrum One\n* Arbitrum Nova\n* Avalanche\n* Scroll\n* Optimism\n* BOBA ETH\n* BOBA BNB\n* KAVA\n* Telos\n* Manta\n* Metis\n* Merlin\n* Rootstock\n* zkLink\n* Mode\n* Blast\n* SEI\n* Taiko\n* Core DAO\n\n#### Summary:\n\nSymbiosis is asking for an amount of liquidity from FRAX DAO to deploy FRAX Octopool (Symbiosis singe-sided cross-chain pool) among different chains to provide the ability to move FRAX among all supported chains including Fraxtal.\n\nCurrently Symbiosis has 6 type of Octopools across 30 chains:\n\n* Stable (includes USDT and USDC)\n* ETH (Includes wETH)\n* BTC (Includes wBTC, BTCB, RBTC…)\n* SIS\n* LADYS\n* pufETH\n\nAll pools can be checked here: https://app.symbiosis.finance/liquidity-v2/pools\n\nSymbiosis is looking to deploy FRAX Octopool among 6 supported chains: Ethereum, Arbitrum One, Avalanche, Polygon POS, Fraxtal.\n\nBesides that, Symbiosis will integrate Fraxtal as a new chain on Symbiosis and deploy wETH pool there where Symbiosis will provide their own liquidity.\n\nOn top of that, Symbiosis will connect 1inch, OpenOcean, Izumi and other DEXs to provide routing to get any assets on those chains including frxETH, sfrxETH, FPI, sFRAX and others.\n\nSymbiosis partners such as Li. fi (Jumper), Socket (Bungee), Rubic, Rango, OKX DEX and more will be able to integrate these pools for FRAX cross-chain transfers between different chains.\n\nBenefits for FRAX and Fraxtal:\n\n1. Symbiosis will provide solution to easily move FRAX between all popular chains similar how Circle CCTP works\n2. Symbiosis will integrate Fraxtal a new chain and connect it to 30 chains that we support\n3. Symbiosis will create wETH on Fraxtal and add their own liquidity there\n4. Symbiosis will be core provider in Li. fi (Jumper) OP-stack chains cross-chain campaign\n5. Symbiosis will connect FRAX Octopool with all popular on-chain aggregators and DEXs on chains supported by FRAX Octopool\n6. Symbiosis partners such as Li. fi (Jumper), Socket (Bungee), Rubic, Rango, OKX DEX will be able to use this liquidity in their systems and apps\n\n#### Proposal Details:\n\nSymbiosis is asking for initial liquidity that should be provided in these single-sided liquidity pools:\n\n* FRAX Ethereum pool: $100,000 of FRAX\n* FRAX Polygon POS pool: $70,000 of FRAX\n* FRAX Avalanche pool: $50,000 of FRAX\n* FRAX Arbitrum One pool: $70,000 of FRAX\n* FRAX Fraxtal pool: $100,000 of FRAX\n\nBelow you can see how it will look like:\n\n![|602x611](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard11/uploads/frax1/original/2X/a/a045985a9eaf041343732fef6a2525cbfe82c79a.png)\n\n#### Integration Roadmap:\n\n1. - Whitelist FRAX token on Ethereum, Polygon POS, Avalanche, Arbitrum One and create  Octopool (cross-chain pool) of FRAX\n2. Configure the relayers network to handle requests from Fraxtal in multi-chain mode\n3. Connect Fraxtal to Symbiosis front-end, API and SDK\n4. Integrate wETH and FRAX pools on Fraxtal. Add Fraxtal to FRAX Octopool and wETH to ETH Octoopool\n5. \n- Integrate Fraxtal DEX for any-to-any routing on Symbiosis in [main app](https://app.symbiosis.finance/swap).\n\n- Integrate 1inch and OpenOcean to FRAX Octopool on Ethereum, Polygon POS, Avalanche, Arbitrum One\n\n6. Launch marketing campaign (cross-chain quest) with Li. fi to popularize cross-chain swaps to Fraxtal and FRAX\n7. Ask other Symbiosis partners to integrate Fraxtal to their protocols and apps\n\n#### Team Members and Qualifications:\n\nAlexey Lushnikov, CTO & Co-Founder - https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexey-lushnikov\n\nNick Avramov, CBDO & Co-Founder - https://www.linkedin.com/in/nickavramov\n\n### Proposal\n- For: Allocate 390,000 FRAX as initial liquidity for Octopool (Symbiosis cross-chain pool)\n- Against: Do nothing",

      "title": "[FIP - 364] Add a new market into Fraxlend on Ethereum (wOETH/frxETH)",
      "content": "### Author\n\nPeter, Origin Protocol core team\n\n## Summary\n \n\nThe proposal aims to incorporate a new market into Fraxlend on Ethereum mainnet with the following specifications:\n\n|Asset|Collateral|Rate Type|Chain|Max LTV|Fraxlend Pair Address|\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| frxETH | wOETH |Variable Rate V2|Ethereum| TBD |TBD|\n\n\n## Motivation\n\nThe proposal seeks to introduce a new market into Fraxlend on Ethereum for wOETH. \nThe new market would lead to increased TVL for Fraxlend, additional revenue to the Frax Protocol and DAO from active loans and liquidations, and will attract a wider user base.\n\n## Background\n\n[Origin Ether](https://originprotocol.eth.limo/#/oeth) (OETH) was launched in May 2023 and is an ERC20 that generates yield while sitting in your wallet. Similar to stETH, OETH yield is paid out daily and automatically (sometimes multiple times per day) through a positive rebase in the form of additional OETH, proportional to the amount of OETH held.\n\nUntil a recent proposal, OETH was an LST aggregator that earned yield by tapping into blue-chip protocols while being collateralized by other LSTs. Over the next few weeks, OETH LST collateral will be divested back to ETH, as OETH will be transitioned into a full-fledged LST. OETH will soon become a superior LST with an extremely tight peg (1:1 redemptions to ETH thru Origin's ARM) and high yields thanks to a combination of the OETH AMO and DVT direct staking through SSV/P2p.\n\nOETH is heavily audited by OpenZeppelin, with audits being conducted quarterly. Previous audits can be found in the OETH docs [here](https://docs.originprotocol.com/security-and-risk/audits). OETH pricing can be determined using the OETH/ETH Chainlink, Dia, or Tellor oracles.\n\n\nwOETH is a ERC-4626 tokenized vault designed to accrue yield in price rather than in quantity. When you wrap OETH, you get back a fixed number of wOETH tokens. This number will not go up - you will have the same number of wOETH tokens tomorrow as you have today. However, the number of OETH tokens that you can unwrap to will go up over time, as wOETH earns yield at the same rate as standard OETH. The wOETH to OETH exchange rate can be read from the contract (function number 16), or via the OETH dapp.\n\nwOETH contract address: 0xDcEe70654261AF21C44c093C300eD3Bb97b78192\n\nCurrent exchange rate as of 6/5/24: 1 wOETH = 1.09228118 OETH\n\nA frxETH/OETH Curve pool is currently available with $250k+ of available liquidity: `curve.fi/#/ethereum/pools/factory-v2-353/deposit`\n\n## Options\n\n- For: Deploy mentioned lending pair on Fraxlend in Ethereum mainnet\n\n- Against: Do nothing",

      "title": "[FIP - 363] Fraxlend Pilot Program with Oval on sUSDe/FRAX and USDe/FRAX",
      "content": "### Simple Summary\n\nThis proposal seeks to implement Oval into the sUSDe/FRAX and USDe/FRAX Fraxlend markets as a pilot program. Oval will enable Fraxlend to recapture liquidation MEV that is currently lost to block builders and proposers. After evaluating Oval’s effectiveness, Fraxlend can consider whether to enable Oval on other markets.\n\n### Abstract:\n\nThis proposal seeks to implement Oval into the sUSDe/FRAX and USDe/FRAX markets as a pilot program.\n\nOval is a liquidation MEV recapture tool composed of 2 parts:\n\n1. A simple, audited smart contract that wraps an oracle price feed. This contract wrapper can not change or delay the price feed data. It only allows for new prices that create liquidation opportunities to be auctioned off to liquidators.\n2. Offchain infrastructure that executes the auction. This is built on top of Flashbot’s MEV-Share which is a trusted MEV infrastructure leader.\n\nIntegrating Oval will allow Frax to recapture a portion of the MEV that is currently being lost on liquidations. Frax can decide what to do with their portion of the recaptured MEV (ie. return to lenders or borrowers, protocol revenue).\n\nThe sUSDe and USDe markets have been chosen as they use a single price feed that is mutable via governance and Chainlink has a USDe/USD price feed available. Oval already has pre-written and audited Chainlink adaptors, so only minor revisions are required to the Fraxlend smart oracle contract. The integration process is simple and will require minimal developer time from the Fraxlend. This pilot program will allow Frax to evaluate the effectiveness and potential scalability of Oval for broader application within its markets.\n\n### Motivation:\n\nWhen a liquidation occurs on Fraxlend (and most other lending protocols), the liquidated user is charged a liquidation fee. These fees go to the 3rd party liquidator and ensure that it is profitable for liquidations to occur in market conditions that are unfavorable to liquidators. However, this often overpays for the liquidation. In these scenarios, liquidators participate in MEV by competitively bidding in an auction for first access to the profitable liquidation. The ultimate beneficiary of this is block proposers who can take up to 90% of the Liquidation Fee.\n\nBy integrating Oval, Fraxlend can run a similar competitive auction where they are the main beneficiaries, thereby recapturing the value that would have gone to the block proposer through MEV. Frax is then free to decide what to do with their portion of the recaptured MEV (ie. return to lenders or borrowers, protocol revenue).\n\n### Specification & Rationale:\n\n#### What is Oval?\n\nOval enables liquidation MEV capture by wrapping oracle price updates as they are pushed onchain so that MEV cannot be extracted without the consent of the protocol.\n\nWith Oval, when searchers perform a liquidation on Fraxlend an order flow auction is triggered using Flashbots' MEV Share—a battle tested tool that allows MEV searchers to compete for MEV extraction offchain.\n\nTo extract the liquidation MEV created by an update, searchers must submit a winning bid, most of which is paid to the protocol as revenue. The winner of the auction gets the right to backrun the oracle update transaction—performing the liquidation by adding their transaction to the block immediately after the price update.\n\nIf no bid is received by the end of the auction window, the oracle price is automatically released and Fraxlend liquidations function as normal. This approach utilizes the solid foundation of Chainlink price feeds and MEV-Share to extract MEV from liquidations.\n\nThe diagram below showcases, at a high level, a comparison between current liquidations and liquidations with Oval.\n\n![|624x339](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard11/uploads/frax1/original/2X/d/d684041a34a1532bc295921449cb4d3291bc3ad4.png)\n\n#### Oracles & Oval\n\nOval is not a price feed oracle\n\n* Oval wraps incoming prices from oracle price feeds, shielding them from MEV searchers.\n* The Oval contract will use the Oracle price feed and initiate an auction for the MEV searchers to bid for access to liquidations.\n* If no one participates in the auction, the price update will be released after 12 seconds (1 block).\n* All Fraxlend logic checks on the price feed are downstream of Oval and can remain as is.\n\n#### Implementation\n\nDeploying Oval requires two simple steps:\n\n1. Deploy Oval smart contracts for the sUSDe and USDe markets\n2. Reference the Oval wrapped contracts in a new Fraxlend oracle smart contract\n3. Update the markets oracle addresses to the new Fraxlend oracle\n\nWe recommend that Fraxlend receives their Oval revenue to a Frax treasury or governance controlled multi-sig for the pilot program. After the pilot program, Frax governance can decide how these funds should be handled and develop a smart contract solution for distributing the funds if desired.\n\nThese steps are further detailed in our [docs](https://docs.oval.xyz/integration). UMA is committed to providing ongoing support to ensure a successful implementation of Oval.\n\n#### Security\n\n* To ensure the security of this system, Oval has completed an [audit](https://blog.openzeppelin.com/uma-oval-audit) by Open Zeppelin and has an additional security bounty of [up to $1M](https://docs.oval.xyz/audit-and-bug-bounty) for any vulnerabilities that are identified.\n* UMA has worked closely with Flashbots to develop Oval. Flashbots has updated the MEV-Share design to add support for Oval.\n\n### Options:\n\n- For: Integrate Oval into the sUSDe and USDe Fraxlend Markets\n- Against: Do nothing",

      "title": "[FIP - 362] Velodrome on Fraxtal - Proposal for Incentives for Liquidity Growth",
      "content": "## **Executive Summary:**\n\nThis proposal aims to develop an impactful liquidity program to support [Velodrome](https://velodrome.finance/)'s expansion on Fraxtal. Velodrome's vision to expand the [MetaDEX](https://medium.com/@VelodromeFi/velodrome-the-metadex-48e4af1ef9a4) across the Superchain is an ideal fit for Fraxtal's goals to rapidly grow its ecosystem.\n\nThis proposal asks for $1M in incentives to build deep liquidity on strategic pools for Fraxtal. Liquidity incentives are critical for bootstrapping a new ecosystem, and getting emissions flowing early will kickstart the flywheel. Deep liquidity is essential for ecosystem development, and Velodrome has a proven track record of attracting users, boosting economic activity, and retaining TVL. From there, organic activity from new DApps, users, and protocol integrations will sustain Fraxtal network activity.\n\n## **Introduction to Velodrome and Superchain Vision**\n\nVelodrome's MetaDEX design is a powerful tool for bootstrapping liquidity at both the protocol level and chain layer. By bringing multiple primitives under the same roof, Velodrome provides a seamless, interactive experience for traders, protocols, and governance participants.\n\nVelodrome has a unique flywheel design ([docs](https://velodrome.finance/docs#)). veVELO holders vote each week to direct $VELO emissions to liquidity pools. In exchange, voters receive 100% of swap fees and protocol incentives from the pools they vote for, creating a self-balancing mechanism that drives $VELO rewards to the most productive pools. Protocols and chains can bootstrap liquidity for their pools by depositing voting incentives. The trading volume supported by the pools will attract additional $VELO by capturing fees for veVELO voters.\n\nVelodrome launched in June, 2022 on Optimism and has since attracted over $150M in TVL and [generated >$9.2b](https://dune.com/0xkhmer/velodrome) in trading volume. Optimism has granted [>5M OP grants ](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Ul8iMTsOFUKUmqz6MK0zpgt8Ki8tFtoWKGlwXj-Op34/edit#gid=970075255)to Velodrome to help grow liquidity and tooling for the expanding Superchain ecosystem. Velodrome has one of the most engaged and educated DeFi communities, with over 13,000 veVELO addresses who participate in weekly governance.\n\nWith its [Superchain](https://medium.com/@VelodromeFi/velodrome-superchain-30161eb0ad6b) vision, Velodrome is developing the architecture to provide a liquidity layer for the interoperable, scalable Optimism stack ecosystem. Velodrome launched its first multichain implementation on [Mode](https://twitter.com/VelodromeFi/status/1787824312893993028), reaching a TVL of ~$4.5m before VELO incentives are live. Velodrome has also announced plans to service BOB, Lisk, Metal and many other unannounced Superchain L2 deployments.\n\n## **Proposal**\n\nVelodrome requests $1M to provide voting incentives to be allocated across the pools with the Fraxtal team's guidance. Each $1 of voting incentives would lead to roughly 1.5X VELO rewards for LPs. The incentives will be deployed over a period of 12 months, prioritizing liquidity for strategic pairs for the Fraxtal ecosystem. A draft model for the first month of liquidity incentives and pool [details can be found here.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vQTE17CQCToPMq9D4hOP4B_XMRrYmJKBNBUiWQj38AWZt98eyB2sP_XJ0Cw7N7CLWw7qIcoZ8hT9YVo/pubhtml)\n\n## **Milestones**\n\n*Initial Velodrome Deployment on Fraxtal*\n\n* Velodrome Superchain Beta or Superchain 1.0 (whichever is code complete) will launch on Fraxtal. Abovementioned pools will be created and liquidity will be seeded by a combination of the Fraxtal and Velodrome teams.\n\n*Emissions Go Live*\n\n* Rewards will either be deposited directly or directed by veVELO voters to the original list of pools to generate the expected APRs for LPs.\n* $5m TVL is the goal by the end of the first epoch following the start of LP emissions.\n\n*Expansion*\n\n* Marketing - Velodrome will regularly highlight the APRs available for LPs on Fraxtal in order to increase awareness and bring in greater liquidity to the ecosystem. Velodrome has an active Discord server and X account with over 238,000 followers.\n* Business Development - Velodrome will actively seek out our existing liquidity partners that make a good fit for Fraxtal. We regularly coordinate with >100 liquidity partners (DeFi, RWAs, Perps, memecoins, etc) across the Optimism Superchain and many are interested in going multichain.\n* Direct voting - The Frax and Fraxtal teams can deposit POL to accrue VELO and increase veVELO voting power and boost LP rewards for select pools.\n* $10m TVL is the goal by the end of the first month following the start of LP emissions.\n\n*Future*\n\n* Velodrome’s concentrated liquidity pools, Slipstream, will be deployed for maximum capital efficiency for LPs and order execution for traders\n* DEX aggregator integration\n* Maintenance with liquidity partners on Fraxtal - coordinate weekly incentives strategy to ensure satisfactory TVLs for all stakeholders (protocols, chain, traders)\n\n## **About the Velodrome Core Team**\n\n* [Alexander](https://twitter.com/wagmiAlexander): Background in politics, technology, and consulting, including time working for the Obama campaign, Apple Inc, and consulting with numerous Fortune 500s.\n* [Tao](https://twitter.com/wagmiAlexander): Background in economics and finance; experience as strategy lead for a large asset manager in Switzerland and at Big Three consulting firm.\n* [Jack](https://twitter.com/jack_anorak): Optimism delegate and growth grants committee member\n* Stas: Open Source contributor to Ubuntu, Mozilla, WordPress.

Currently, our price feeds are integrated by Fraxlend, Glyph and Trinity on Fraxtal. The aim of this proposal is to help Fraxlend gain further market share and enhance its resiliency.\n\n### **BACKGROUND**\n\nRedStone is the major Oracle on Fraxtal. As the only price feeds provider, RedStone offers the two major oracle implementations:\n\n1. RedStone Classic - Traditional Push model, supporting 5 major pairs at the time of writing ([Here](https://docs.redstone.finance/docs/smart-contract-devs/price-feeds)).\n2. [RedStone Core](https://docs.redstone.finance/docs/smart-contract-devs/get-started/redstone-core) - Pull oracle model allowing for gas efficiency, and low-latency of price feed updates, based on attaching signed data packages to transaction call-data. The model that allowed i.e. Gearbox to grow its TVL by 10x, reaching over $400M.\n\nOur team would like to enhance Fraxlend’s resiliency by incorporating RedStone price feeds and enabling future expansions with new markets powered by RedStone (we are often the first Oracle to provide trending assets like with LRTs, Ethena, etc.).\n\n### **ABOUT REDSTONE**\n\nRedStone is the quickest-growing Modular Oracle with clients including Venus, ListaDAO, Kinza, Pendle, Morpho, Ethena, Etherfi, Renzo, Puffer, Silo, Sommelier, Gearbox, Frax, Swell, Angle and 70+ other companies. Our Oracles are available on 50+ chains including Fraxtal, Arbitrum, BNB Chain, Ethereum, Merlin Chain, BOB, Blast, TON, Mode and many more.\n\nRedStone’s mission is to enable DeFi protocols and dApp’s builders to reach their full potential with versatile, gas-optimized and robust price feeds delivered cross-chain. Our team consists of seasoned engineers with an average of 15+ years of dev experience and a hard-working BD & Marketing team supporting partner protocols at every step: conferences, Twitter spaces, targeted intros, etc. Our technology has been acknowledged by the leading figures in the crypto space, we are proud to be backed by the most renowned Web3 Entrepreneurs such as Sandeep Nailwal (Polygon), Alex Gluchovski (zkSync), Emin Gün Sirer (Avalanche), Richard Ma (Quantstamp) and VCs like Lemniscap, Coinbase Ventures, Blockchain Capital, Maven11, Distributed Global, Lattice Fund and others.\n\nOur tech-first approach allows us to be a leader in LRT & LST price feeds and provide Oracles for blue chip assets, LP and staked tokens and numerous trending tokens. We are the first oracle to create price feeds for weETH (Etherfi) and ezETH (Renzo), STONE (StakeStone) and numerous other assets.\n\n### **PROPOSAL**\n\nIntegrating [sfrxETH / ETH](https://etherscan.io/address/0xdd60c54115C19e0c6360AD4762B88BB8076D50a8#readProxyContract) price feed on Ethereum mainnet into Fraxlend. The feed is configured with a 0.5% deviation threshold and 6 hours heartbeat. The price discovery is set by multiplying the frxETH / ETH market price by the sfrxETH / frxETH contract’s ratio provided by Frax.\n\n### **BENEFITS TO FRAXLEND**\n\nBy accepting the proposal Fraxlend is going to benefit in a number of ways:\n1. Integrating the feed would increase Fraxlend’s oracle robustness (currently it uses only a single Curve AMM to derive the frxETH / ETH rate, whereas RedStone takes all reliable sources).\n1. RedStone would enable new markets as Fraxlend evolves.\n2. The RedStone team will support the further cross-chain expansion of Fraxlend.\n3. The integration would be a step for Frax DAO eligibility for the possible future RedStone rewards after TGE.\n4. Further supporting Fraxlend on the marketing and Go-To-Market front with new assets.\n\nThe RedStone team is dedicated to continuing to help the Frax ecosystem in successful expansion horizontally (i.e support for Fraxtal and cross-chain deployments) and vertically (new assets at Fraxlend).\n\n### **VOTE**\n* For: Integrate RedStone sfrxETH / ETH Price Feed into Fraxlend on Ethereum.\n\n* Against: Do nothing.",

      "content": "## Authors\nYieldNest Core Team\n\n## Summary\nThis proposal advocates for the allocation of Protocol-Owned Liquidity (POL) in frxETH/ETH L1 to the YieldNest [ynETH](https://docs.yieldnest.finance/protocol-design/yieldnests-nlrts-and-lrts/yneth) ([Audited by Chain Security](https://docs.yieldnest.finance/security/audits)) 7x boosted vault. YieldNest will create a gnosis-safe multisig wallet where the frxETH/ETH will be received, and the ynETH will be distributed to the original deposit address from FRAX. The objective is to cement and expand the collaboration and alignment between FRAX and YieldNest. YieldNest is offering a 7x boost on [YieldNest points (seeds)](https://docs.yieldnest.finance/governance-and-tokenomics/seeds-and-loyalty-program) (EPOCH 01) for any ETH transferred to ynETH from FRAX (Standard boost is 5x). All ynETH is also earning ETH staking rewards on top of the boosted seeds. The frxETH/ETH POL is open-ended; it is up to the team/comptroller's discretion what amount of allocation is given.\n\nYieldNest is a Liquid Restaking Protocol (LRP) that provides simple-to-understand, risk-adjusted restaking strategies that offer user-controlled, liquid, and risk-adjusted exposure to curated AVS categories. YieldNest aims to build a long-term relationship with FRAX, explore various restaking strategies, and deploy the LRTflywheel on the Fraxtal chain for full integration with the FRAX ecosystem. See below ynETH and ynDeFi as an example AVS category that can be built with the YiledNest protocol.

This will leverage the boosted yield opportunities provided by YieldNest's unique [seeds program](https://docs.yieldnest.finance/governance-and-tokenomics/seeds-and-loyalty-program) offered to FRAX. In EPOCH 01, during the first seven days, FRAX will get a 7x boost (Standard boost 5x); afterward, FRAX will get the standard two seeds per hour and potential other boosts moving forward.\n\n## Background and Motivation\nYieldNest is a Liquid Restaking Protocol (LRP) that provides simple-to-understand, risk-adjusted restaking strategies that offer user-controlled, liquid, and risk-adjusted exposure to curated AVS categories. YieldNest aims to build a long-term relationship with FRAX, explore various restaking strategies, deploy the LRTflywheel on Fraxtal for full integration with the FRAX ecosystem, and develop protocol-specific Active Validated Services (AVSs) to enhance decentralization and increase capital efficiency for the FRAX protocol.\n\nThe strategic allocation to YieldNest’s ynETH vault is in line with FRAX’s objectives to maximize returns on its POL by engaging in collaborative and high-yield strategies. This initiative promises substantial returns across various market conditions and will fortify the partnership between FRAX and YieldNest, enhancing the market positions of both protocols.\n\n\n## Voting\n* For: Authorize FRAX to allocate the specified POL in frxETH/ETH to the YieldNest ynETH 7x boosted vault\n* Against: Do not authorize POL allocation and maintain the current liquidity strategy",

As FRAX can't just charge a rage quit fee in this scenario, I propose the protocol to pay 8,300 FRAX to shut it down so that I can unlock my LP tokens and then withdraw from them on Curve.\n\nSince I locked in that product 234 days ago, these have been my total claimed rewards plus my currently claimable ones: 8141,27 CRV + 67,16 CVX + 378,77 FXS. That’s a total of $7,696 as of now. I own 93% of the Convex FRAX TVL, so I would pay 8,300 (7696/0.93 rounded up) FRAX for the protocol to shut it down.\n\nThis pool has almost no volume, so the protocol doesn’t benefit in any way from me providing liquidity there. On top of that, if I can leave the pool I’d be able to provide liquidity in some other FRAX products, which would also be better for the protocol.\n\n## Pool Details\n\nPool / LP Token : ETH: 0xe7c6E0A739021CdbA7aAC21b4B728779EeF974D9\nMy Convex FRAX vault: ETH: 0x8335EAd657C223A16F2cF8762FD88f8A3a32DbB8\n\n# Vote\n\n• For: Shut down Convex FRAX rETH/frxETH for 8,300 FRAX\n• Against: Do Nothing",

Authorize lending AMO to deposit minted FRAX into the following Morpho Blue pairs with the mentioned max authorized allocation.\n\n|Asset|Collaterals|Max Authorized Allocation|Lending Market|Risk Manager|\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|FRAX|sUSDe, USDe|200,000,000 FRAX|Morpho Blue / MetaMorpho|[Re7](https://www.re7.capital/) and TBD|\n\n## Background and Motivation\n\nMorpho Blue is a decentralized protocol that facilitates overcollateralized lending and borrowing crypto assets (ERC20 Tokens) on the Ethereum Virtual Machine. The protocol, designed as an immutable smart contract, serves as a trustless base layer for lenders, borrowers, and applications, with risk management layers provided by [MetaMorpho](https://docs.morpho.org/concepts/morpho-blue/core-concepts/externalized-risk-management).\n\nRe7 Labs, specializing in DeFi R&D and liquid crypto investment strategies, and other firms (to be determined) are collaborating with Morpho Blue to provide risk management services through the MetaMorpho vault system, enhancing risk management and lending vault capabilities.\n\nAlgorithmic Market Operations (AMOs) make FRAX one of the most potent stablecoin protocols, creating maximum flexibility and opportunity without altering the base stability mechanism that made FRAX a leader in the stablecoin space. So far, we have deployed multiple AMOs, including lending AMOs on the Fraxlend, Aave, and Gearbox protocols.\n\n## Proposal Details\n\nThis proposal involves minting FRAX and depositing it into designated MetaMorpho Vaults that exclusively use sUSDe and USDe as collateral assets. The maximum authorized allocation for this action is set at 200 million FRAX. Frax AMO will initiate this process by allocating FRAX into the Re7 Vault within MetaMorpho, starting the integration of FRAX into Morpho Blue's lending markets. This strategic allocation aims to enhance liquidity and utility for FRAX within the Morpho Blue ecosystem while leveraging Re7 Labs and other future risk management firms' capabilities within the MetaMorpho vault system.\n\nThis integration will expose FRAX to the high demand for borrowing against sUSDe and USDe within Morpho Blue's lending markets, thereby increasing Frax's market share and further solidifying its position as a leading stablecoin protocol.\n\n## Voting\n\n* For: Authorize the Lending AMO to deposit minted FRAX into the Morpho Blue pairs through MetaMorpho Vaults with the max authorized allocation mentioned.\n\n* Against: Do nothing.",

We run a popular TG channel with over 6k subs that publishes the latest and freshest headlines for crypto. We also have a daily livestream broadcast on Twitter and Youtube. \n\nSQUID is a reward token distributed to everyone who makes Leviathan News operate. In our system, anyone can submit headlines to the News Bot in TG. Once approved, SQUID points are assigned and at the end of each month, we distribute SQUID tokens proportionally based on activity. For the previous month we had 124 active contributors to the news feed. \n\n### Motivation:\n\nLeviathan is a big supporter of Frax, we cover it regularly on our channel and on the livestream. We want to build a strong base on Fraxtal for future growth and liquidity of the SQUID/wfrxETH pair to benefit Frax and the ecosystem as a whole. \n\n### Voting:\n\n* For: Add the SQUID/wfrxETH pool to the FXS gauge controller\n* Against: Do nothing.",

Therefore, I'd give up everything I made there over 7 months and even lose some money.\n\nThis pool has almost no volume, so the protocol doesn't benefit in any way from me providing liquidity there.

      "title": "[FIP - 341] Frax Singularity Roadmap Part 1",
      "content": "### **Author**\nSam Kazemian & various Frax contributors and community members\n\n## **Motivation**\nThe Frax Singularity Roadmap aims to unify all aspects of Frax into a unified vision and roadmap.  This is the first in a series of posts outlining the vision. The Frax Singularity Roadmap should be the guiding light of the Frax community.\n\n\n## **Post-Singularity Frax Era**\nThe launch of Fraxtal and achievement of effectively 100% CR are milestones that start a new era in Frax. Fraxtal is the substrate that enables the Frax ecosystem; it is the operating system of Frax. Fraxtal completes Frax’s core product offerings – Frax is strategically adding new subprotocols and Frax assets but all the necessary building blocks are now in place. The community can now focus on larger opportunities and paradigm shifting products as well as issuing native Frax Assets across all of the crypto universe.\n\n\nIn order to get here, Frax has generated $45m+ to achieve effectively 100% CR. This was a huge effort on everyone’s part, including a significant sacrifice from FXS holders to improve the overall health of Frax. The FRAX stablecoin has been largely dormant during this process and FXS revenue sharing was cut by 90% to conserve assets. That can now change entirely.\n\n\n## **Frax: The Only Full Stack Protocol**\nFraxtal is the home of Frax Nation & the Fraxtal Network State. With Fraxtal, the Frax community has a sovereign home, culture, and digital space they can call their own. This is why Fraxtal is being built. Frax already issues its own currencies & is fully governed and owned onchain by FXS stakers. Now, Frax has its own full-fledged network in Fraxtal.\n\nSoon, L3s of Fraxtal will go online. L3s are like fractals and similar to sub-communities that have their own distinct identity & culture but part of the overall Frax Network State. They benefit from earning Frax Asset yields, RWA yields, Fraxtal settlement+security guarantees, and a constant stream of FXTL points to their L3 contract on Fraxtal based on its popularity, usage, and TVL. **All this together governed by FXS which represents an interest in the digital nation of Frax.**\n\nFraxtal stands on the shoulders of Optimism to create one of the most developer friendly L2’s on Ethereum. While most L2's simply mirror Ethereum's incentives, we’ve gone further and innovated on base incentives to create the most compelling possible experience for developers and users - and we will continue innovating.  By owning the entire stack, Frax can introduce features like account abstraction, new precompiles, privacy functionality, aggregated DA, and Superchain interop. These features will dramatically improve the on-chain experience & make Fraxtal the preferred location to hold, stake, and transfer crypto in the coming months and years.\n\n**With the above in mind, centralized exchanges and payment service providers that integrate Fraxtal chain deposits/withdrawals early can get allocations of FXTL points until the program concludes.*\n\n\n## **Kickstarting Fraxtal**\nFraxtal's innovative Flox Blockspace Incentives have just finished its first epoch of allocating FXTL points to users and popular smart contracts. **This makes Fraxtal the only network to automatically distribute rewards block by block to users & developers for using the chain.** These incentives run for many years & will become known as a core innovation of Fraxtal as users and developers will become accustomed to earning rewards to use blocksapce, unlike any other network.\n\n*The road to $100B+ Fraxtal TVL starts now and with the target of EOY 2026.* All Frax Assets including FRAX, sFRAX, frxETH (and new Frax Assets) will be issued on Fraxtal first going forward. The Frax Core Developers are actively moving to issue Frax Assets on Fraxtal including native 4626 yield vaults, minting, and redeeming. When Frax assets reach a new ATH supply, so will Fraxtal TVL. This is a unique synergy only possible because of Frax’s full stack system.\nFrax Assets will permeate every chain but the base contracts and assets will exist on Fraxtal mainnet.\n\n## **Fraxtal’s Fractal Scaling Roadmap**\nFraxtal is targeting 23 L3s in the next 365 days to kickstart the Fraxtal Nation community.  Frax has always taken a positive sum approach and directly supports the community and builders that integrate with us. We believe 23 L3s is the perfect number of chains that we can actively support with direct developer access/incentives/investment and more. The first two L3s are already in the works and we expect to fill the remaining spots in the coming months! L3s wil not only earn FXTL points through Flox, but the 23 L3 slots are for official partners that will get additional support from the Fraxtal Core Devs and large allocations of FXTL total supply. \n\nIf you are deploying any form of L3 or appchain and want to explore joining the Fraxtal Network State early, reach out to the Frax Core Developers & our strategic rollup-as-a-service provider partners: Conduit.xyz, Gelato.network, & Caldera.xyz to express your early interest.\n\n## **Overview of Frax Assets**\nFrax is the only protocol in all of crypto that has 4 separate tokens/assets in the top 200. This number will only increase as will the rank of Frax Assets. Thus, it’s important to have a current overview of all Frax Assets & their utility, pegs, and design specs.\n\n|Frax Asset|Utility & Specs|\n| --- | --- |\n|Frax Share (FXS)|Governance/Staking token of all of Frax Finance, base pair of all FXS Liquidity Engine|\n|FRAX & Staked FRAX (s)FRAX|Dollar Peg, 4626 yielding vault|\n|Frax Ether & Staked Frax Ether (s)frxETH|ETH Peg, initial gas token on Fraxtal, 4626 yielding vault, soon to be LRT with v2|\n|Frax Bitcoin & Staked Frax Bitcoin (s)frxBTC|BTC peg, 4626 yielding vault, fully collateralized by BTC on Bitcoin PoW chain|\n|Frax Price Index (FPI)|Flatcoin/CPI peg, no yielding token - peg is inflation resistant|\n|Frax Bond (FXB)|Zero coupon bond tokens that convert to FRAX on maturity similar to US Treasuries|\n|Fraxtal Points (FXTL)|Points that represent usage of the Fraxtal blockchain to be tokenized at a future date. More details forthcoming.|\n\n\nAll Frax Assets should be usable as the gas token on Fraxtal as the chain matures.\nPotential new Frax Assets coming this year include: **frxNEAR**, **frxTIA**, **frxMetis** & more.\nFRAX, the flagship dollar-pegged stablecoin of Frax Finance, is now effectively fully collateralized allowing us to enter the new FXS tokenomics era described below.\n\n## **FXS Singularity Tokenomics**\nAll roads lead to FXS and it is the ultimate beneficiary of the Frax ecosystem. Now that 100% CR has been effectively reached, FXS can receive all utility and benefits of the entire Frax stack. We propose that the protocol fee switch be turned back on, with 50% of the yield flowing to veFXS and the other 50% used to buy FXS and other Frax assets to pair in the FXS Liquidity Engine (FLE). The FLE will allow Frax to continue building its balance sheet while dramatically increasing liquidity for FXS and paired Frax assets. According to Defillama, even without counting multiple sources of revenue like Fraxtal chain fees and the Fraxlend AMO, [Frax makes over $40m of revenue annualized](https://defillama.com/protocol/frax-finance) as of this writing. \n\n## **veFXS Revenue Share+Fee Switch Turned ON**\nveFXS stakers will get total protocol fees at the passing of this proposal added to the veFXS yield distributor on Ethereum mainnet as well as veFXS yield distributor contract on Fraxtal soon after.\n\n![|293x293](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard11/uploads/frax1/original/2X/f/fb61bc066e37308f1bd2d2f115571de89dfb98c5.png)\n*FXS Liquidity Engine will create increasing FXS POL against first Frax Assets but can and will be expanded to other voted pairs by the community.*\n\nFXS Liquidity Engine (FLE)\nThe FXS Liquidity Engine is a protocol owned liquidity Schelling-point of pairs of every Frax Asset against FXS. Revenue allocated to the FLE is used to buy back half FXS & half Frax Assets to increase the liquidity depth of the pair. The amount allocated to the FLE is based on the trailing price of FXS. If FXS 30-day trailing price is lower than the prior month, then 25% of protocol revenue is allocated to the FXS Liquidity Engine instead of veFXS. If the 30-day trailing price is higher than the prior month, then 25% more of protocol revenue is distributed to veFXS instead. \nThe long term goal is to increase the utility, liquidity, and lending credit to FXS to unprecedented levels as revenue comes in block-by-block.\n\nPowered by Fraxswap+BAMM, these will be the initial FLE POL pairs:\nFXS-frxBTC pair (more on frxBTC timelines & info in Singularity Part 2)\nFXS-sfrxETH pair\nFXS-sFRAX pair\nFXS-FPI pair\nFLE gauges will be releasing soon to power different FLE pairs including bespoke FLE pairs. FLE gauges that go live with this vote: FXS-frxETH, FXS-FRAX.\nThis liquidity engine is entirely on Fraxtal mainnet and nowhere else so Frax profits directly increase Fraxtal TVL, liquidity, & lending capacity in real time.\n\nFrax Finance revenue to FXS and the FXS Liquidity Engine is not cyclical and generates consistent revenue through all market cycles to increase POL constantly in all macro conditions. When volatile assets go down in value, revenue from FXBs and (s)FRAX should increase revenues. Thus, the FLE should be a constant, direct value add to FXS holders and stakers alike.\n*Note: there are certain strategic assets that will be kept on the balance sheet/treasury including CVX (staked as vlCVX), cvxCRV, cvxPRISMA, & cvxFXN, among other assets that will be added as “strategic assets” in future governance votes. These strategic assets will not be sold or distributed to veFXS holders nor sold to power the FLE.*\n----------------------------------\n#### Due to the length limitation of Snapshot proposal, the rest of this proposal can be found in the discussion link (v10):",

      "title": "[FIP - 340] Proposal for retiring of the Harmony canFRAX and canFXS",
      "content": "### Authors\n\nFrax Core Team\n\n## Summary\n\nThis proposal suggests retiring the outstanding Harmony addresses for the canFRAX and canFXS tokens following the security breach of the Harmony’s Horizon Bridge in 2022.\n\n## Background and Motivation\n\nFrax Finance previously utilized the Harmony Horizon Bridge to facilitate the transfer of FRAX and FXS tokens to the Harmony network, resulting in the creation of canFRAX and canFXS tokens. Unfortunately, in June 2022, the Harmony Horizon Bridge was compromised in a significant [security breach](https://techcrunch.com/2022/06/24/harmony-blockchain-crypto-hack/), resulting in the loss of a substantial amount of FRAX and FXS tokens that backed the canFRAX and canFXS tokens circulating on Harmony One Network.\n\nThe security breach of the Harmony Horizon Bridge was a severe incident that led to the loss of user funds and undermined trust in the integrity of the Harmony bridge. Frax Finance believes that it is Harmony's responsibility to reimburse the FRAX and FXS tokens lost in the bridge due to the security breach, rather than burdening Frax Finance with the obligation to reimburse users. While Harmony has created some form of repayment and restitution program for hack victims, it has fallen dramatically short of reimbursing anywhere near the full loss of the Harmony Bridge hack even nearly 2 years after the fact. That is why we believe full responsibility lies on Harmony. Frax Finance is a direct victim of the Harmony Bridge hack just like all affected users.\n\n## Proposal Details\n\nGiven the circumstances surrounding the security breach of the Harmony Horizon Bridge and the loss of FRAX and FXS tokens backing canFRAX and canFXS, it is proposed to retire the outstanding tokens for canFRAX and canFXS tokens. Users that hold these tokens can and should seek remediation from Harmony rather than Frax Finance. Frax Finance itself is a victim of the situation and not culpable for liability of a breach it did not cause nor deserve. By retiring canFRAX and canFXS tokens and asking holders of these tokens to directly seek restitution from Harmony, the Frax Finance ecosystem will be strengthened and a burden removed from the protocol’s balance sheet that was never its own fault or doing.\n\n### canFRAX\n\nToken Address on Harmony: [0xFa7191D292d5633f702B0bd7E3E3BcCC0e633200](https://explorer.harmony.one/address/0xfa7191d292d5633f702b0bd7e3e3bccc0e633200)\n\nTotal Supply: 8,139,045.038 canFRAX\n\n### canFXS\n\nToken Address on Harmony: [0x0767D8E1b05eFA8d6A301a65b324B6b66A1CC14c](https://explorer.harmony.one/address/0x0767d8e1b05efa8d6a301a65b324b6b66a1cc14c)\n\nTotal Supply: 123,959.834 canFXS\n\n## Voting\n\n* For: Retire Harmony canFRAX and canFXS\n\n* Against: Do nothing.",

In addition to the well-known “Convex-like” behavior of aggregation/optimization of underlying protocols, Convergence also gathers mechanisms inspired from Curve, and Olympus. Gauges and veTokenomics are used to drive emissions, and a *Bonding Program* has been established. Bonds are used to build Protocol Owned Liquidity (POL) and a treasury that allows Convergence to ensure self-sustainability, but also to reward token holders with an intrinsic incentive mechanism that does not rely on underlying protocols’ aggregation.\n\nConvergence’s main products are:\n- a boosting layer for Curve LPs via Stake DAO\n- a yield-bearing locked primitive that acts as a Curve ecosystem index (ysCVG)\n- a governance aggregator (mgCVG)\n\n## **Motivation:**\nConvergence’s liquidity consists of 2 pools (CVG/WETH and CVG/FRAXBP), where the liquidity is almost entirely owned by the protocol as *Protolcol Owned Liquidity*.\n\nThe CVG/FRAXBP pool is a secondary pool, which purposes are the following:\n- allowing users to buy CVG using stablecoins;\n- being a farming venue for the treasury which will accumulate CRV CVX and FXS rewards that will be distributed back to ysCVG holders.\n\nThus, we are looking for a gauge on Frax to maximize earnings from the CVG/FRAXBP pool. The LP will be max locked on Convex/Frax, and vote incentives will be offered to veFXS holders on Votemarket. As previously mentioned, 80% of farmed rewards will be distributed back to CVG lockers who chose to lock their tokens for ysCVG.\n\n## **Voting:**\n- For: Add the CVG/FRAXBP pool to the FXS gauge controller\n- Against: Do nothing",

      "title": "[FIP - 337] Use 100,000.00 vlCVX to vote for fxUSD/FRAX LP gauge on Curve Finance for 6 months",
      "content": "### **Authors**\n\nAladdin Core Team\n\n## **Summary**\n\nUse 100,000.00 vlCVX to vote for fxUSD/FRAX LP gauge on Curve Finance. f(x) Protocol will match Curve Incentives for this LP by utilizing part of the veFXN owned to vote on f(x) Protocol gauge .\n\n## **Background**\n\nThe f(x) Protocol is a DeFi solution that addresses the need for a stable asset in the cryptocurrency space while mitigating centralization risks and capital efficiency issues. f(x) Protocol was conceived by Aladdin DAO; the US banking crisis in March 2023, combined with the depegging of USDC, highlighted the need for a new type of decentralized, highly scalable stable asset.\n\nInitially, f(x) Protocol introduced a new concept called a “floating stablecoin” or fETH. fETH is not pegged to a fixed value, but rather gains or loses a fraction of the price movements of ETH. This allows fETH to hold its value well in any market condition.\n\nWhen f(x) Protocol first launched in August of 2023, f(x) introduced the DeFi world to something special: a powerful new defi primitive centered around a complimentary token pair. The f(x) pair, or “stable-leverage pair” primitive is based on a simple concept: split a yield-bearing token (called the base or reserve token) into two parts: a low-volatility (i.e. stable) part and a high volatility (i.e. “leveraged”) part, both tokenized. Stable tokens can be staked in a rebalancing pool to earn yield from the reserve tokens, while the high volatility tokens protect the peg simply by existing, themselves providing a remarkably simple, safe, and cheap way to take ETH leverage.\n\nAs the protocol has gained attention and adoption, our community highlighted the need of a fully decentralized and hard pegged stablecoin. After extensive discussions and governance process, Aladdin DAO is now prepared to introduce f(x) Protocol’s new USD-pegged stablecoin, fxUSD.\n\nAs a stablecoin, fxUSD offers four key features never before combined:\n\n* Built-in yield, derived from LSDs in the reserve\n* Scalability: rapidly scalable based on direct demand\n* Stability: reliable peg in both directions, backed by f(x)’s invariant\n* Resilience: collateralized by Ethereum LSDs, with zero real-world asset exposure\n\nAt genesis, we are choosing 5 stablecoins to pair fxUSD with: FRAX (Frax Finance), crvUSD (Curve Finance), pyUSD (Paypal), DOLA (Inverse Protocol) and GRAI (Gravita Protocol). We are aiming for all these pools to have double gauges, on Curve and f(x). Each partner will either use owned vlCVX or veCRV to vote for incentives on Curve’s gauge or will incentives veFXN votes on f(x) Protocol’s gauge.\n\n## **Motivation**\n\nIncreasing liquidity and visibility for the fxUSD/FRAX pool is critical to the operation of f(x) Protocol. It would also be beneficial and additive to the ecosystem in the following ways:\n\n* Having higher rewards will incentives more users to deposit in the pool, getting more FRAX deposited;\n* Having a deeper pool will help stabilize FRAX’s peg;\n* fxUSD is backed in part by frxETH; attracting more deposits will increase the minting of fxUSD, thus increasing frxETH supply.\n\n## **Proposal**\n\nIn order to create a deeper pool and to attract liquidity which will support fxUSD - FRAX swaps we propose that Frax vote with 100,000 vlCVX/ epoch for the fxUSD/FRAX pool for the next 12 epochs on Votium. In exchange, f(x) will use treasury owned veFXN to vote on f(x) Protocol gauge in order to match Curve’s rewards for the same duration.\n\n- **For**: Use 100,000.00 vlCVX to vote for fxUSD/FRAX LP gauge on Curve Finance for 6 months.\n\n- **Against**: Do nothing.",

Inverse has a long and close relationship with Frax, having supported the DOLA/FraxBP for 1.5 years, DOLA/Frax pools on Arbitrum and Optimism chains, and the soon-to-launch sFRAX collateral market on Inverse Finance’s fixed rate lending market, FiRM. Given this relationship, it is rational to further support join initiatives such as the new DOLA/FRAXPYUSD pool to further deepen on-chain liquidity for the DOLA and Frax stablecoins.\n\n## Voting:\n\n* For: Add the DOLA/FRAXPYUSD pool to the FXS gauge controller\n* Against: Do nothing",

      "content": "### Summary\n\nAdd Curve HFXB/Frax LP token to FXS gauge controller on Arbitrum\n\nCurve pool address: [Curve.fi](https://curve.fi/#/arbitrum/pools/factory-stable-ng-32)\nCurve pool / token: 0x8f5d46267EB52F3aA6E141004A781469D445888c\nCRV Gauge: 0x725E997571F4fD144bB741762E8fA9f1D11761a7\n\n[hourglass.com](http://hourglass.com)\n[Twitter](https://twitter.com/hourglasshq)\n[Documentation](https://docs.hourglass.com/technical-documentation/hourglass-index)\n\n### Background\n\nHourglass is excited to announce HFXB, the first ever index of Frax Bonds (FXBs). HFXB is designed to aggregate secondary liquidity for FXBs while improving their composability across the DeFi ecosystem. It will also manage FXB rollover and rebalancing for users that aim to maintain exposure to a particular FXB duration. While this post will discuss a particular implementation of HFXB (which benchmarks an average ~6 month duration), Hourglass Frax Bond Indices can theoretically target any duration along the yield curve.\n\nHFXB’s smart contract design resembles an asynchronous ERC-4626 vault, whereby users can periodically deposit sFrax to mint shares of the vault. This sFrax is then deployed via a rebalancing strategy such that the vault’s average duration is within a margin of the target duration. Shares minted from the vault, otherwise known as the HFXB token, can be freely traded on Curve, redeemed for the underlying, or otherwise be composed across DeFi. HFXB vault rebalancing will happen on the most efficient market it can find, whether that be the individual FXB pools on Curve or the time-bound token marketplace on Hourglass. Further details about HFXB can be found in the [documentation](https://docs.hourglass.com/technical-documentation/hourglass-index/hfxb).\n\n### Motivation\n\nHFXB is designed to drive meaningful locked liquidity to the Frax protocol by deepening FXB secondary liquidity and simplifying its user experience. Rather than Frax needing to maintain unique liquidity pools on Curve and Fraxlend for each duration FXB, each of which require periodic rollovers, the protocol can incentivize a small number of indices which perpetually facilitate price discovery and liquidity for the Frax yield curve. This has the added benefit of improving FXS incentive efficiency, and as such we propose that HFXB is added to the gauge controller.\n\n### Voting\n\n• For: Add the HFXB/Frax Curve pool to the FXS gauge controller on Arbitrum\n• Against: Do nothing",

      "content": "### Author\n\nBarree\n\n## Summary\n\nWhitelist the Alchemix DAO Multi-sig to stake veFXS\n\n## Background and Motivation\n\nAlchemix has long admired Frax and viewed them as a partner, sharing many synergies in the way we approach scaling our protocols. Frax was the inspiration for our AMOs, which are currently our largest driver of revenue to the DAO. We recently migrated our largest AMO from alETH-ETH to alETH-frxETH on Curve. Alchemix also provides FRAX and frxETH vaults, allowing self-repaying loans on these assets, and further utility for holding them. Since the days of the D4 pool, our protocols have been working together with co-incentives to provide additional yield to our LPs and to service additional synthetic alAsset demand from our users. Currently Alchemix and Frax maintain partner pools on Main net, Arbitrum and Optimism, and provide co-incentives on a majority of pools together.\n\nIn addition to direct incentives, Alchemix has long been accumulating and locking CRV, CVX and various other liquidity-driving assets to help scale the size and effectiveness of our pools. (see https://alchemix-stats.com/ for details) Now that the majority of our AMOs operate on pools that pair alAssets with Frax assets, we would like to begin locking FXS as well. In order to do so at the DAO level, we need to be able to lock from our multisig. This will allow us to increase the efficiency of our joint pools, further align incentives between our protocols, and continue to foster an already great relationship between our teams.\n\nThank you for your consideration.\n\n## Proposal\n\n**For: Whitelist the Alchemix DAO Multisig to stake veFXS**\n**Against: Do Nothing**",

      "title": "[FIP - 327] Onboarding Frax to tfBILL",
      "content": "Frax Community,\n\nGiven recent conversations surrounding treasury management preempting the upcoming launch of FXBs in 2024, we wanted to formally introduce ourselves as Adapt3r Digital, the General Partner of tfBILL, our on-chain treasury bill product. We are proposing an initial maximum allocation limit of $20 million to tfBILL, in line with Centrifuge’s recent proposal.\n\n##   Executive Summary\n\n* With the passing of FIP-308, Frax will be able to onboard to a diverse set of on-chain T-Bill issuers.\n* There are nuanced yet significant differences between the options today, with the logical intersection for Frax being those that can maximize for liquidity and regulatory compliance.\n* tfBILL was structured for institutional scale since the underlying collateral is spot T-Bills ($700B global daily volume) rather than ETFs (<$400mn global daily volume). Tokenized ETF products will present significant frictions in liquidity and hidden fees for a balance sheet as large as Frax due to the potential slippage when FXBs are scaled (i.e. $100mn+ redemptions are not frictionless).\n* tfBILL was also structured to minimize regulatory risk and thus maximize flexibility. Given our cautious approach to integrations, we are free to operate both domestically and abroad, including with FinresPBC\n* MJL Capital, our direct affiliate, is also heavily aligned with Frax given our position of a long-term holder and staker of FXS in our hedge fund strategies. As such, we are open to receiving fees partially paid in FXS token.\n\ntfBILL is a purpose-built, scalable, already live solution that allows direct access to U.S. Treasury Bill yields so that protocols can leverage all of the benefits of RWAs. Users deposit USDC into a smart contract vault, obtaining tfBILL tokens representing Limited Partner interest in a BVI-registered fund holding exclusively treasury bills. The entity, designed for bankruptcy remoteness, assures investment security with full legal recourse for tfBILL holders. Launched in September 2023, the vault currently accepts USDC deposits from KYC'd non-U.S. investors, with a Total Value Locked (TVL) of ~$8,600,00 and an estimated yield of 5.32%. We can adopt any structure that aligns with FRAX requirements/goals and have the flexibility to provide both onshore and offshore US operations. If FRAX decides to operate in the US through FinresPBC, we have the capacity to participate. Importantly, we are fully compliant and have a clean cohort of investors in our fund. No anonymous users today. tfBILL differentiates itself through compliance-focused strategies, emphasis on regulated counterparties, enhanced transparency via on-chain Net Asset Value attestations, and on-demand liquidity. Utilizing battle-tested smart contracts from TrueFi ensures robust security and operational independence. tfBILL redefines simplicity, transparency, and security in on-chain treasury instruments.\n\n## Overview\n\nOur flagship product, the [Adapt3r Short-Term U.S. Treasury Bill Fund](https://app.archblock.com/offering/0x942953FCfbb00c735e4C651078b146D327a95194), offers on-chain stablecoin holders 24/7, direct access to US Treasury Bill yield. Upon depositing USDC to the smart contract vault, investors are issued tfBILL tokens which represent Limited Partner interest in a BVI registered professional fund that exclusively holds treasury bills. The entity is bankruptcy remote and solely owned by the holders of tfBILL, who have full legal recourse to tfBILL’s underlying securities. The vault is built on TrueFi’s open, transparent, and battle-tested smart contracts and is conveniently offered on Archblock’s institutional-grade frontend marketplace.\n\nThe vault was deployed in September 2023 and currently accepts USDC deposits from KYC’d non-US investors. At the time of writing, the TVL of the vault is approximately $8,600,000 and offers an estimated yield of over 5%.\n\ntfBILL was built in response to compliance and complexity concerns we continually heard from DAOs and on-chain investors about existing treasury bill offerings. Specifically, many DeFi entities and users expressed difficulty evaluating existing options due to contrived and opaque legal structures with uncertain investor recourse, hidden layers of fees, and aggressive operation in regulatory “grey areas.”\n\nSince the beginning, the primary goal has been to build an on-chain treasury instrument that is simple, transparent, and secure for all users. Here are some of the key ways tfBILL differentiates itself:\n\n1. Compliance-focused: A tokenized asset is only as strong as the regulatory position of its issuer. Given treasury bills are US securities, tfBILL complies with all applicable regulations (i.e. SEC Reg S), only accepting qualified non-US investors with rigorous controls in place. We are in the process of establishing a US feeder fund which will enable direct access to US investors such as Frax.\n2. Simply T-Bills: tfBILL is directly backed by treasury bills purchased through and custodied by a regulated broker-dealer in the United States. The Fund does not allocate to ETFs which offer greater volatility, higher tracking error, lower liquidity, more counterparties, and higher fees. By purchasing treasuries directly, tfBILL has access to far greater liquidity with over $700 billion in average daily volume to sell/buy into versus less than $400 million for treasury ETFs like SHV.\n3. Enhanced transparency: Adapt3r Digital has gone one step further than most to ensure the underlying backing of tfBILL is open and accessible to all. Everyday the third-party Fund Administrator provides Net Asset Value attestations, which are subsequently uploaded on-chain and to IPFS. These capital updates are required for fees to be taken from the vault. In every on-chain update the manager includes the Net Asset Value of the fund (and thus tfBILL tokens), the underlying positions/CUSIPs, and the source PDF that the Fund Administrator provides. This same data file is used to update our Transparency Board. Finally, the Fund is audited on an annual basis by Wolf & Co.\n4. On-demand liquidity: tfBILL is mintable on-chain through Archblock’s interface, utilizing TrueFi’s smart contract architecture. This interface is open 24/7 and currently accepts USDC, but can be expanded to other stablecoins and chains with little friction.\n5. Battle-tested smart contracts: Single points of failure are the hidden risk embedded in every tokenized asset. By using TrueFi’s battle-tested smart contracts, which have facilitated almost $2 billion in lending volume to date, tfBILL has achieved two significant milestones that differentiate us from all other players in this space: 1) offering a new tokenized asset without compromising on the smart contract level and 2) offering enhanced protections and controls by separating the front-end, blockchain, and d’App from the manager of the product itself. Unlike other treasury bill primitives, TrueFi’s underlying infrastructure is independent from Adapt3r’s operations and is always on.\n\n## Flow of Funds Diagram\n\n![|624x215](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard11/uploads/frax1/original/2X/e/e6553dbf4e837568d96b8d5c7704f2b9ae0d958f.png)\n\n## In conclusion\n\nUltimately, Adapt3r Digital and our affiliate, MJL Capital, are deeply aligned with the Frax mission and purpose. We want to see the project succeed. If you are looking to learn more about tfBILL check out our [documentation](https://docs.adapt3r.com/adapt3r-digital-docs/) or reach out via DM or email.\n\n## Pricing and payment\n\nThe pricing for this proposal is structured to streamline fees. The potential usage of FXS as also helps to align incentives towards long-term interests versus short-term benefits. The fee structure is as follows:\n\n|Portfolio Fee|0.30% p.a. on assets in tfBILL up to $50M, 0.2% $50-100M, 0.1% >$100M|0.30% is paid on an ongoing basis to Adapt3r, payable in stablecoins and/or FXS tokens. The difference between 0.30% and the effective fee is rebated from Adapt3r back to Frax on an ongoing basis.|\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|Protocol Fee|0.20%|This fee is currently on holiday and not applicable to Frax’s potential investment.|\n\n## Voting\n\nFor: Support for onboarding the Frax protocol to Adapt3r Digital with mentioned fees and an initial maximum allocation limit of $20 million to tfBILL.\n\nAgainst: Do nothing.",

      "content": "## Authors\n\nFrax Core Team\n\n# Summary\n\nThis proposal suggests the introduction of a 10% protocol fee on Fraxlend, Frax Finance's lending platform. This initiative is aimed at aligning Fraxlend more closely with industry standards, particularly the practices of major players like Aave, and leveraging its value to support our goal of achieving a 100% Collateralization Ratio (CR) for the FRAX stablecoin.\n\n# Background and Motivation\n\nSince its inception, Fraxlend has operated without a protocol fee, focusing on growth and user acquisition. However, as we evolve and aim to fortify our financial stability and service quality, introducing an protocol fee becomes essential. Setting an protocol fee at 10% positions Fraxlend competitively in the DeFi lending market and generates revenue that can be reinvested into the platform and the FRAX ecosystem.\n\n# Proposal Details\n\n* Smart Contract Compatibility: Our existing Fraxlend smart contracts are already equipped to support this fee structure, allowing for a smooth implementation process. Protocol fee is a percentage of interest which goes to Frax Finance DAO.\n* Fee Implementation: Introduce a 10% protocol fee across all lending pairs on Fraxlend.\n* Revenue Utilization: The revenue generated from this fee will contribute to the stability and growth of the FRAX stablecoin, aiding our pursuit of a 100% Collateralization Ratio.\n\n# Voting\n\n* For: Implementing a 10% protocol fee on Fraxlend.\n* Against: Do nothing.",

The Frax Core Team is unique among its contemporaries as it does not prioritize growth/marketing internally, choosing to invest resources in technological development and research. Flywheel has stepped up to fill this void in a grassroots manner. In a world of mercenaries, Flywheel stands out as a missionary proving ourselves many times over not only of our loyalty but effectiveness in spreading awareness of Frax far and wide. With Fraxtal (Fraxchain) around the corner, Flywheel's role in Frax will only grow in importance and will give us an opportunity to expand the surface level of our coverage and outreach.\n\nIn 2024, our goals are to:\n\n* Transform passive observers into active participants in the Frax Ecosystem.\n* Cultivate a vibe for Frax that people can identify with and have positive feelings toward.\n* Solidify Flywheel as the educational and cultural backbone of Frax.\n\n### Plans for 2024 \n\nLast year, how our grants were structured were on a per-task basis. This year, we will list the general responsibilities that Flywheel will be executing on behalf of Frax as well as to keep its own house organized. In order for Flywheel DeFi to still function and operate at the level it does now, then we must be able to fund itself properly. Funding from this grant will be able to support a staff of 6 people which include myself as DeFi Dave (CEO, Core Advocate), Sam McCoulloch, (Executive Producer), Kiet Fong (CFO, Co-Host), Peepo (Media Editor), Carissa Campo (Growth Lead), and Phil Lewy (Content Specialist):\n\n|Item | Staff | Cost |\n|--- | --- | --- |\n|Education and Awareness | Sam, Phil, Peepo, Dave, Kiet |  $210,000 Base\n|Business Development | Dave (Core Advocate), Sam | $50,000 Base, $200,000 Extra Incentives at the discretion of Frax Core Team\n |Culture and Events  | Dave, Carissa | $105,000 Base\n |Buffer Costs | Misc. | $5,000 Base\n\n### Proposal\n\n* For: Approve Flywheel Funding of $370k Base & $200k Extra Incentives for 2024\n* Against: Do Nothing",

These trustless, zero-coupon bond-like tokens are entirely backed by FRAX, providing a yield curve and pricing the time value of lending FRAX back to the protocol. By including FXBs in the Frax Curve AMO, we aim to diversify Curve AMO strategies and support the adoption and growth of this innovative product. This integration aligns with our commitment to fostering a robust and versatile DeFi ecosystem.\n\n## Proposal Details:\n\n#### FXB Documentation: https://docs.frax.finance/frax-v3/fxbs\n\n#### FXB-related addresses:\n\nFXB Factory: [0x7a07D606c87b7251c2953A30Fa445d8c5F856C7A](https://etherscan.io/address/0x7a07D606c87b7251c2953A30Fa445d8c5F856C7A#code)\n\n\n## Voting:\n\n* For: Whitelisting FXBs for Frax Curve AMO with max allocation cap of 5 million FRAX per FXB\n* Against: Do nothing",

It is a liquid and fungible receipt token for ETH deposited into the Dinero protocol which is then staked and used to run validators for the Ethereum network. Users can deposit their pxETH into an auto compounding pxETH vault in exchange for an apxETH vault token which benefits from Ethereum staking rewards and other revenue forms such as MEV tips and block rewards. Future apxETH yield and pxETH withdrawals can be tokenized and used within DeFi. Further details about pxETH and apxETH can be found in the whitepaper [here](https://github.com/redacted-cartel/pirex-eth-whitepaper/blob/master/pxETH_whitepaper.pdf).\n\npxETH can be redeemed for ETH from the Dinero protocol either instantaneously for ETH which has yet to be staked or via ETH which is unstaked from validators. In the future, an incentivized withdrawal pool will facilitate quicker pxETH withdrawals from the protocol, especially when there is an ETH unstaking queue and/or adverse market conditions.\n\n### Motivation:\n\nTo provide additional immediate pxETH liquidity, the Redacted DAO is incentivizing DEX liquidity for pxETH, using governance power in its treasury and BTRFLY bribes. Redacted has a long and close relationship with Frax - it has one of the largest DAO FXS holdings and has a veFXS bribe market on hidden.hand, Redacted’s bribe market.\n\nGiven this close relationship, pairing frxETH on LPs makes immediate sense, and would allow Redacted to have a closer relationship with Frax whilst helping grow its pxETH product, together with frxETH.\n\n### Voting:\n\n* For: Add the pxETH/frxETH Balancer pool to the FXS gauge controller\n* Against: Do nothing.",

      "content": "## Summary\nImplement Curve VST/FRAX Gauge ragequit function with a 20% fee.\n\n## Background and Motivation\nIn recent weeks, our community has actively engaged in discussions and voting regarding implementing a ragequit function for the VST/FRAX pool's FXS Gauge on Arbitrum. Two previous proposals, featuring a [0% fee](https://gov.frax.finance/t/fip-292-implement-ragequit-function-for-vst-frax-gauge-locker-with-0-fee/2664) and [a 7% fee](https://gov.frax.finance/t/fip-303-implement-ragequit-function-for-vst-frax-gauge-locker-with-7-fee/2765) respectively, were put forward but did not align with the community's expectations and precedents set in similar scenarios. Recognizing this, several community members have approached the Frax core team, advocating for a new proposal that aligns with the routine fee structure observed in comparable cases. This has led to the suggestion of implementing a 20% ragequit fee, a rate that mirrors the standard fee applied in analogous situations within our ecosystem (e.g. [Saddle L2D4 Gauge](https://gov.frax.finance/t/fip-280-implement-saddle-l2d4-gauge-ragequit-function-with-20-fee/2528)). \n\n## Pool Details\nPool / LP Token :   ARB: 0x59bf0545fca0e5ad48e13da269facd2e8c886ba4\nFXS Gauge :           ARB: 0x127963A74c07f72D862F2Bdc225226c3251BD117\n\n# Vote\n• For: Implement Curve VST/FRAX Gauge ragequit function with a 20% fee.\n• Against: Do Nothing",

It is a liquid and fungible receipt token for ETH deposited into the Dinero protocol which is then staked and used to run validators for the Ethereum network. Users can deposit their pxETH into an auto compounding pxETH vault in exchange for an apxETH vault token which benefits from Ethereum staking rewards and other revenue forms such as MEV tips and block rewards. Future apxETH yield and pxETH withdrawals can be tokenized and used within DeFi. Further details about pxETH and apxETH can be found in the whitepaper [here](https://github.com/redacted-cartel/pirex-eth-whitepaper/blob/master/pxETH_whitepaper.pdf).\n\npxETH can be redeemed for ETH from the Dinero protocol either instantaneously for ETH which has yet to be staked or via ETH which is unstaked from validators. In the future, an incentivized withdrawal pool will facilitate quicker pxETH withdrawals from the protocol especially when there is an ETH unstaking queue and/or adverse market conditions.\n\n### Motivation:\n\nTo provide additional immediate pxETH liquidity, the Redacted DAO is incentivizing DEX liquidity for pxETH, using governance power in its treasury and BTRFLY bribes. Redacted has a long and close relationship with Frax - it has one of the largest DAO FXS holdings and has a veFXS bribe market on hidden.hand, Redacted’s bribe market.\n\nGiven this close relationship, pairing frxETH on LPs makes immediate sense, and would allow Redacted to have a closer relationship with Frax whilst helping grow its pxETH product, together with frxETH.\n\n### Voting:\n\n* For: Add the pxETH/frxETH Curve pool to the FXS gauge controller\n* Against: Do nothing.",

      "title": "[FIP - 308] Onboard Frax to Centrifuge Prime",
      "content": "### Authors\nCentrifuge team\n\n### Executive Summary\n\nThis is a proposal to onboard the Frax protocol to Centrifuge Prime, for the purposes of contributing to a differentiated and resilient RWA capability within FraxDAO. Onboarding to Centrifuge Prime will create a dedicated pipeline of resources and assets to serve the Frax protocol. If accepted, this proposal will establish a debt ceiling of $20M to be established for the Anemoy LTF, a BVI registered and regulated US Treasury fund.\n\nCentrifuge has a long track record of working with DAOs to bring RWAs on as collateral. Notable firsts include minting MakerDAO’s first real-world asset, structuring the first on chain securitization, launching the RWA Market with Aave, and partnering with BlockTower to bring the first credit fund operations on chain. Centrifuge Prime is built for the needs of large decentralized organizations. It provides the infrastructure and services to quickly and easily onboard and scale a fully diversified portfolio of real-world assets. Through Centrifuge Prime, decentralized organizations can get access to an institutional ecosystem of RWA partners and service providers to curate a portfolio of assets across their desired risk profiles.\n\nCentrifuge is a DAO-governed protocol. k/factory contributes to the Centrifuge protocol by providing development, and infrastructure, and working with users to ensure adoption.\n\n### Description\n\nThis proposal will:\n\n1. Work with FraxDAO to establish a legal conduit for RWA investments\n2. Allocate to $20M of collateral to the Anemoy Liquid Treasury Fund\n3. Facilitate diversified and relevant investment opportunities for Frax\n\n#### The Legal Conduit\n\nCentrifuge Prime utilizes a legal framework to provide an effective and resilient setup for RWA investments. We have collaborated with Frax community members on this framework, and this proposal will seek to use the protocols existing infrastructure for facilitating these investments.\n\nA descriptive diagram of the Centrifuge Prime legal framework is included below for reference.\n\n![|592x345](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard11/uploads/frax1/original/2X/c/c799897a5dc249b389b2d0839fe451e800af4a9f.jpeg)\n\nThis framework is based on our extensive experience in MakerDAO setting up [similar](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/mip6-blocktower-credit-transaction-documents/19019) [structures](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/rwa-002-new-silver-restructuring-risk-and-legal-assessment/21417). There, the same structure supports a >$1B in deployed capital.\n\n#### Anemoy LTF\n\nThe Anemoy LTF is a purpose-built onchain offering combining lowest possible credit risk with fast liquidity and low fees. Centrifuge as the tokenization and issuance protocol offers a programmable DeFi-native integration.\n\nThe LTF provides an onchain RWA product that offers:\n\n* Real-time transparency: Each position in the portfolio is tokenized and represented onchain, allowing for near real-time transparency into the portfolio’s overall status. Integrations with price oracles, onchain verifications, and programmable execution will allow this to be the most transparent product in the market today.\n* Legal recourse and investor protection: The offered token is an actual fund share using the ability to tokenize a fund under BVI law. The token itself represents ownership and not only the accompanying legal framework. Token holders have direct claims to the underlying assets in the fund, (US Treasury bills) and an ability to request a redemption in-kind to receive actual T-Bills. The combination of owning a share of a BVI-regulated fund with all AUM held with a regulated US custodian and traded through a registered US prime broker offers investors the highest-quality recourse and protection. Low fees: Unlike most other offerings, the fund holds T-Bills directly in its own account, saving investors fees charged by the ETF issuers or other intermediaries.\n\nMore information on Anemoy and the LTF can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/149iGX9qC92CCcVyMoj6KMQxkYvspRo9xhqp2kKr5RbI/).\n\n#### Diversified Investment Opportunities\n\nCentrifuge Prime also provides dedicated access to the Centrifuge ecosystem and community. As part of this proposal, the Centrifuge team will work directly with the community to ensure that the available RWA portfolio meets Frax’s needs.\n\nThe [Centrifuge Credit Group](https://gov.centrifuge.io/tag/credit-group), a DAO entity setup to provide risk and credit analysis, can be utilized to provide general-purpose reporting for the assets invested. This provides an additional level of ongoing monitoring and independent analysis that Frax can utilize.\n\nBeyond US treasuries, the Centrifuge Prime setup would also allow the Frax DAO to allocate into the following asset classes:\n\n|Bucket Focus|Description|Targeted Returns|Liquidity Thresholds|\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|Liquidity|Lowest risk while maintaining US Treasuries, MMF, AA+ rated short term bonds|5-6%|Daily|\n|Preservation|Investments in senior secured loans such as real estate, corporate bonds etc.|6-8%|3-6 months|\n|Acceleration|Trade finance, non-bank originators, emerging markets|8-20%|3-24mo|\n\n### Pricing and payment\n\nThe pricing for this proposal is structured to streamline fees. The usage of FXS as a reward helps to align incentives towards long-term interests versus short-term benefits. The fee structure is as follows:\n\n|Fees|||\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|Portfolio Fee|0.35% p.a. on assets in Prime up to $50M, 0.2% $50-100M, 0.1% >$100M|Paid on an ongoing basis to Centrifuge|\n|Frax Rewards|5000 FXS, paid incrementally over 12 months into the Centrifuge treasury, starting with the first $1M Deployment into Centrifuge Prime|To cover costs of resource and facilitation time. Centrifuge DAO intends for this to create better alignment with strong skin in the game incentives for success.|\n\n## Voting\n- For: Support for onboarding the Frax protocol to Centrifuge Prime with mentioned fees and rewards.\n- Against: Do nothing.",

      "title": "[FIP - 303] Implement ragequit function for VST-FRAX Gauge locker with 7% fee",
      "content": "### Authors\n\n@ankhrypto \n\n## Summary\n\nImplement VST-FRAX Gauge ragequit function with 7% withdrawal fee.\n\n## Background and Motivation\n\nThe Vesta-Frax VST-FRAX pool was a popular stable pool on Arbitrum, contributing to liquidity provision and stablecoin swaps. However, the protocol is set to wind down in Oct 17 2023 as seen [here ](https://curia.vestafinance.xyz/t/sunset-of-vestas-protocol-action-plan-proposal/359).\n\nIn light of these developments, this proposal seeks to introduce a “ragequit” mechanism to the VST-FRAX Gauge on Arbitrum, allowing lockers to exit the pool without a penalty. This feature will offer liquidity providers an organized route to withdraw their assets from the pool, considering the evolving context driven by sunset of Vesta protocol.\n\nI recreated this proposal because discussion has fizzled out about it and no new proposal has arisen, all while many people's liquidity (including mine) is held hostage by Frax due to the will of the few managing Convex governance.\n\n### Why 7% fee?\n\nLockers respected all their obligations and willingly made a commitment to Frax, and while I feel it is unfair to charge any withdrawal fee in this case, this proposal will not pass without one, leaving us hostage. Considering lockers are equally being deprived of many years of yield they were promised, a 7% fee should be a reasonable amount to pay for the early unlock of these assets.\n\nIf anyone feels this should be higher, feel free to discuss it, preferably before this goes to Snapshot.\n\n## Pool Details\n\nLP Token: 0x59bf0545fca0e5ad48e13da269facd2e8c886ba4\nGauge: 0x127963a74c07f72d862f2bdc225226c3251bd117\n\n# Vote\n\n• For: Implement the ragequit function with 7% fee.\n• Against: Do Nothing",

      "title": "[FIP - 300] Frax Finance and Axelar network",
      "content": "## Authors\nAxelar Foundation\nFrax Finance Core Team\n\n# Summary\n\nThis proposal suggests that Frax Finance utilizes Axelar network, a leading cross-chain platform that can facilitate the seamless bridging of FRAX and other Frax Finance assets to chains where a Frax Ferry doesn't exist. In furtherance of this proposal, Frax Finance commits to refraining from launching a Frax Ferry to the specified chains, instead adopting Axelar network’s solution (e.g., axlFRAX) as the representation of Frax Finance’s assets on those chains. To be clear, axlFRAX is not technologically secured by the Frax Protocol, but is technologically secured by the decentralized Axelar network.\n\n# Background and Motivation\n\nFrax Finance has gained substantial recognition for its innovative stablecoins, FRAX, FPI, frxETH, and yield-bearing tokens, sFRAX and sfrxETH. As we continue to expand our presence in the DeFi landscape, interoperability across multiple chains becomes crucial. While we've successfully launched Frax Ferry on various chains, some chains may lack a dedicated Frax Ferry. This poses challenges in providing liquidity and accessibility to users on those chains.\n\nAxelar network, a fully decentralized, open-stack cross-chain solution, offers a reliable and efficient means of bridging assets across different blockchain ecosystems. By utilizing the Axelar network, Frax Finance aims to overcome the limitations posed by the absence of a Frax Ferry on certain chains, ensuring that Frax tokens remain accessible, tradable, and functional in diverse blockchain environments. Frax Ferries requires a substantial amount of infrastructure and engineering effort on the team’s part. Thus, it makes sense to work with a reputable cross-chain network to expand FRAX issuance on the “long-tail” of chains.\n\n# Proposal Detail\n\nThis proposal suggests that Frax Finance adopts Axelar network’s representation of Frax Finance tokens on chains where a dedicated Frax Ferry is unavailable. This adoption will enable the seamless transfer of Frax Finance tokens between supported chains.\n\n### List of Chains\n\n* Osmosis\n* Mantle\n* Linea\n* Kujira\n* Manta\n* Scroll\n\n### Future Chain Inclusion\n\nTo maintain transparency and community involvement, any requests to adopt axlFRAX on new chains will require a governance proposal. This proposal should outline the reasons for inclusion and provide a clear rationale for extending axlFRAX to additional chains. Community members will have the opportunity to vote on these proposals.\n\n### Governance Proposal for Ferry Launch\n\nIt is important to note that Frax Finance maintains the flexibility to launch a Frax Ferry on the specified chains if deemed necessary. However, any such launch will be subject to a new governance proposal and approval from the Frax Finance community.\n\n# Voting\n\n* For: Support for the adoption of Frax Finance bridged tokens by the decentralized Axelar network on specified chains.\n\n* Against: Do nothing.",

      "content": "Author: Scream, Core Member and Community Lead on Overnight Finance\n\n## Background:\n\n Overnight.fi is a protocol focusing on asset management, with a specialization in neutral-risk strategies. At the heart of its product line is USD+, which is a yield-driven stablecoin, fully backed by collateral. This collateral for USD+ is rooted in DeFi strategies that generate returns. These strategies encompass lending to platforms like Aave, and include both stablecoin-to-stablecoin and neutral-risk strategies.\n\n**USD+ by Overnight Finance**\nUSD+ is a DeFi product that offers users the opportunity to invest in a diversified basket of stablecoins. The main goal of USD+ is to optimize yield generation by allocating funds across various yield-bearing protocols and platforms in the DeFi ecosystem. In essence, users deposit their stablecoins into the USD+ pool and receive interest-earning USD+ tokens in return.\n\n## Motivation:\nWe propose the addition of an USD+/FraxBP liquidity pool to the FXS gauge controller. This integration will aim to leverage the popularity and stability of both USD+ and FraxBP tokens, potentially enhancing liquidity, stability, and overall engagement in the Frax ecosystem.\n\n* **Increased Liquidity**: The introduction of an Overnight Finance USD+/FraxBP pool can attract more liquidity providers, hence making the Frax ecosystem more robust.\n* **Diversification**: A diversified set of assets and partnerships, such as with Overnight Finance, strengthens the resilience of the Frax ecosystem against market downturns.\n* **Alignment with Frax's Vision**: By supporting stable assets like USD+ and FraxBP, Frax reiterates its commitment to stability and decentralization.\n* **Incentivizing Holders**: The addition of this pool to the FXS gauge controller can incentivize holders with additional FXS rewards, thus encouraging longer-term holding and engagement.\n\n### Specifications (Arbitrum):\n\nCurve Pool Address: 0xb34a7d1444a707349bc7b981b7f2e1f20f81f013\nUSD+ Token: 0xe80772Eaf6e2E18B651F160Bc9158b2A5caFCA65\nCurve Gauge: 0x4645e6476d3a5595be9efd39426cc10586a8393d\n\n## Voting:\n\n- For: Add USD+/FraxBP curve pool on Arbitrum to FXS gauge controller\n- Against: Do nothing",

      "title": "[FIP - 292] Implement ragequit function for VST-FRAX Gauge locker with 0 fee",
      "content": "### Authors\n\nVesta core team\n\n## Summary\n\nImplement VST-FRAX Gauge ragequit function with 0 withdrawal fee.\n\n## Background and Motivation\n\nThe Vesta-Frax VST-FRAX pool was a popular stable pool on Arbitrum, contributing to liquidity provision and stablecoin swaps. However, the protocol is set to wind down in Oct 17 2023 as seen [here](https://curia.vestafinance.xyz/t/sunset-of-vestas-protocol-action-plan-proposal/359).\n\nIn light of these developments, this proposal seeks to introduce a “ragequit” mechanism to the VST-FRAX Gauge on Arbitrum, allowing lockers to exit the pool without a penalty. This feature will offer liquidity providers an organized route to withdraw their assets from the pool, considering the evolving context driven by sunset of Vesta protocol. \n\n### Why 0 fee?\nPrior wind down efforts such as [this](https://gov.frax.finance/t/fip-280-implement-saddle-l2d4-gauge-ragequit-function-with-20-fee/2528) implemented the rage quit with a 20% withdrawal fee. The VST-FRAX pool should not wind down with the same amount of fee because this is not merely a wind down of the pool structure, but rather this is a wind down of the asset in the pool.\n\nVesta's wind down will decrease the supply of the VST stablecoin to 0. Starting on Oct 17, 2023, a PSM with USDC will be opened and redemption will be enabled. The PSM will allow users to swap VST for USDC on a 1:1 basis. Redemption will allow any third party users to close anyone's vault position in Vesta. By enabling lockers to withdraw, they will be able to also participate in the redemption process, helping VST fully wind down instead of leaving potentially substantial amount of residual VST in the pool.\n\nFurthermore, early lockers locked into the pool because of high amount of emission enabled by Tetranode's vote. Given the protocol wind down, Tetra is shifting his vote elsewhere, decreasing the pool's emission to 0. By adding a withdrawal fee, current lockers who entered with the expectation of high emission will be left with 0 reward for the rest of the lock duration, decreasing the lockers' faith in Frax's gauge system. Furthermore, Tetranode will likely move the reward to a new gauge, which people can move into and lock again. Asking for a high withdrawal fee will discourage people from locking in new gauges in the future.\n\n## Pool Details\n\nLP Token: 0x59bf0545fca0e5ad48e13da269facd2e8c886ba4\nGauge: 0x127963a74c07f72d862f2bdc225226c3251bd117\n\n# Vote\n\n• For: Implement the ragequit function with no fee.\n• Against: Do Nothing",

      "content": "### Summary\n\nAdd a gauge for each frxETH/FRAX Arrakis LST (Liquid Staking Token) Vault - one on Arbitrum.\n\n**Arbitrum**\nUni pool: 0x631bCab02663855349035B761eD111A5BCB521Dc\nPALM vault: 0x0C2708496c705eFa34921581eC768F0bf4ff1BF4\n\nAdditionally, the vault on Arbitrum may be double incentivized by Arbitrum grant once our application is approved.\n\n### Background & Motivation\n#### Arrakis Finance and Arrakis LST Vaults\n\nArrakis Finance is a non-custodial on-chain market-making protocol that builds both the infrastructure and the strategies that enables and execute sophisticated algorithmic market-making on Uniswap V3.\n\nArrakis LST Vaults are permissionless and incentivizable LP infrastructure that provide algorithmic market-making strategies for LST assets. They are designed to solve the critical challenges that LST protocols and LPs currently are facing:\n\n* **High cost for maintaining deep liquidity**\n  Deep liquidity is crucial for LSTs as staying tightly pegged on the secondary market is what qualifies a liquid staking token liquid. Traditionally, it is exceedingly expensive to maintain sufficient liquidity depth and protocols have spent tens of millions worth of incentives for it.\n\n  Arrakis LST Vaults on the other hand tackle this issue via high capital efficiency with minimal capital requirement. Leveraging the concentrated liquidity feature of UniV3, the strategies use limit orders, asymmetric liquidity, and algorithmic rebalancing to minimize price impact for larger trades and therefore make liquid staking tokens actually liquid. This means that LST protocols can reduce their expenditure on liquidity mining incentives since less capital is required now to establish a liquid market.\n\n* **IL (Impermanent Loss) risk for LPs**\n  LPs are in constant struggle between earning liquidity mining incentives and taking on IL risk. The amount of IL risk is directly correlated to the size of the exposure the liquidity has to the market.\n\n  Arrakis LST Vaults mitigate IL risk by managing the amount of liquidity exposed to the market at any particular moment for both bid and ask prices. This approach minimizes the likelihood of engaging in excessive buying and/or selling at unfavorable prices, hence reducing the IL risk.\n\n#### How Frax can benefit from it\n\nFirst of all, even though both frxETH and FRAX already have quite deep liquidity on their own, the direct liquidity for frxETH/FRAX is rather thin and poorly managed at the moment. Arrakis LST Vaults can help increase the liquidity depth of frxETH/FRAX while only requiring limited capital and incentives.\n\nSecondly, frxETH is mostly paired with ETH or other LSTs, and FRAX is mostly paired with other stablecoins. A liquid market of frxETH/FRAX can efficiently route the swaps between frxETH and other stablecoins or between FRAX and other LSTs, which will lead to wider circulation of frxETH and FRAX.\n\nFurthermore, LP positions in Arrakis LST Vaults can act as collaterals and be integrated into lending markets.\n\nArrakis has been assisting Frax with liquidity management since Arrakis V1 product, and we would like to strengthen this long-term relationship with more and better services that can further benefit the Frax community.\n\n### Vote\n\n- **For**: add Arrakis LST (Liquid Staking Token) Vaults of frxETH/FRAX on Arbitrum to FXS gauge controller.\n\n- **Against**: do nothing\n\n#### Reference\n\n- [Website](https://www.arrakis.finance/)\n- [Mirror](https://mirror.xyz/0x916563f8476b988855af0b8b8A3D56072E1917FA)\n- [Docs](https://resources.arrakis.fi/)\n- [Audits](https://resources.arrakis.fi/resources/audits)\n- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ArrakisFinance)\n- [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/arrakisfinance)",

      "title": "[FIP - 286] Sticker MVP Proposal",
      "content": "### Author\n\nDeFi Dave & one of the many matts\n\n### Proposal\n\nGrant $30k of FXS to fund building the MVP for the sticker protocol and premiere demo of it at ETHDenver 2024 or at a future event when Fraxchain is live.\n\n### Background and Motivation\n\nthe sticker protocol prints digital stickers, imbues them with value, and facilitates the swapping of stickers across the web\n\nStickers are frxETH-backed non-fungible digital objects that can be traded IRL and around the social web, as collectibles, memorabilia, and visual reactions. Because stickers communicate emotions and not explicitly value, the[ traditional mental transaction costs associated with social micropayments](https://nakamotoinstitute.org/micropayments-and-mental-transaction-costs/) are eliminated and financial value piggybacks on our natural emotional reaccs.\n\nWhen people receive stickers as reactions to posts or messages in chats, they can choose to keep them—perhaps this sticker is from a dear friend, or perhaps it’s from a rare early set—or burn them to receive the backing frxETH, realizing the monetary value embedded within.\n\nAs non-fungible stores of frxETH, stickers have an insane monetary premium and therefore increase the monetary premium of frxETH itself. Yield from the frxETH embedded in the sticker protocol is automatically redistributed amongst participants and stakeholders by the protocol.\n\nStickers are an adhesive art form, a unique medium of creativity and social expression that helps the p2p web stick together.\n\n---\n\nDuring the FraxBUILD Hackathon, the Sticker Protocol came in first in the Consumer Adoption category. So far, only smart contracts have been created for it. The purpose of this is to build out a full-fledged MVP with the goal of launching a first edition of the project next year on Fraxchain.\n\nBy funding this project, it will act as a way for frxETH to increase in market share from the angle of social demand rather than purely economic incentives all while using the Frax protocol as the underlying primitive.\n\n### Technical Details\n\nWhat follows is a summary of the technical details outlined in this notion doc, so click through to see the full details.\n\nhttps://oneofthemany.notion.site/sticker-protocol-v1-d332f46051d14c88b43378bc0706741e\n\n#### The Sticker Protocol\n\nThe sticker protocol is deployed on Fraxchain because of a) L2 gas for nft transfers, naturally, and b) built-in sfrxETH staking, which ensures that the protocol’s frxETH reserve is instantly available for redemption. The sticker protocol itself receives and redistributes the aggregate yield in the following ways:\n\n1. 20% to finders, those that facilitate the printing of stickers (minting platforms, social apps)\n2. 10% to Adhesive, LLC, the core dev entity responsible for building the protocol\n3. 70% to Stick Together, an on-chain collective\n\nStick Together is an on-chain collective tasked with facilitating the stickers ecosystem. As the primary recipient of sticker yield, it has a vested interest in the flywheel effect (pun intended) of printing more stickers and increasing the velocity of an individual sticker. Stick Together is also the administrator of the very few parts of the protocol that are governance-integrated, namely how yield is distributed.\n\nStick Together will use much of its earnings to subsidize or eliminate gas costs for onboarding and transfers, based on a variety of heuristics, proof-of-personhoods, etc. The goal is to remove gas costs for the long tail of users. It could also use its revenue to retroactively incentivize platform integrations, fund grants, and more. Initially it will be a simple multisig, foundation-style, but could be expanded to include a governance token.\n\nIndividual sticker minting (‘printing’) logic is controlled by Printer implementation contracts provided by artists. The sticker protocol makes it trivial to deploy and index these contracts for a unified experience over the set of all stickers in the ecosystem while allowing artist-controlled collections.\n\n#### The User-Facing PWA\n\nA mobile-first PWA for printing, collecting, and trading stickers. Gas for onboarding, inviting, and trading is sponsored by Stick Together. Session keys and account abstraction means users sign in with anything and never need to manually approve a transaction. Fund your sticker wallet directly, by (liquidity) bridge, or with Moonpay.\n\nThe app is invite-only, and all invites include a set of pre-printed stickers, ensuring that everyone on the network has stickers to swap. Invites can be generated by Stick Together or individual users can invite a friend by printing stickers on their behalf.\n\nThe app will support inventory management, activity feeds, and a polished send/receive flow to support an IRL launch at a conference in the future.\n\n### Scope and Timeline\n\nThe scope of work consists of:\n\n* User research and brand design\n* Landing Page Design & Development\n* Smart Contract Development\n* Consumer PWA Development\n* Quality Assurance & Testing\n\nWe estimate that an MVP will take 3-4 months to complete. Upon completion, we will showcase the product on Flywheel DeFi in a video feature explaining and demoing it to the wider community.\n\n$30k will be paid out in FXS. $15k will be sent after the proposal passes, $10k will be sent upon release of MVP feature on Flywheel, and $5k will be sent before ETHDenver. Of the grant money, $25k will be used to fund development and $5k will be used for promotional activities at ETHDenver.\n\nWe intend to launch The Sticker Protocol on Fraxchain so if for whatever reason Fraxchain is not live by ETHDenver, we will wait for the next relevant conference to have an event promoting it.\n\n#### Proposed MVP Launch Plan\n\nIn a perfect world we’d like to launch The Sticker Protocol at a conference with the following experience: attendees onboard using our mobile-optimized PWA and receive many duplicate editions of a single sticker from the genesis sticker pack. they’re then incentivized to trade between other attendees to collect the full set:\n\nUsers scan each others QR codes to open a trading interface between each other where they can swap stickers in real-time (imagine dragging and dropping a sticker at the top of your device where a wormhole catches it and teleports it to the other person — they receive it moments later and the new sticker places itself gently into their collection).\n\nAssembling a full set of the genesis pack also grants them an event-exclusive set of stickers that will surely be a massive flex in the future. all gas will be sponsored and account-abstracted away for the world’s smoothest experience.\n\none of the many matts—[the guy with the NFT-dispensing chip embedded into his hand](https://themanymatts.lol/)—and Defi Dave (and perhaps others!) will also have some custom stickers to give away to those who meet them IRL. Furthermore, we can collaborate with relevant influencers and brands to create and distribute their stickers as well.\n\n### Team\n\n* [DeFi Dave](https://twitter.com/DeFiDave22) is the Co-founder of Flywheel DeFi and Core Advocate for the Frax community. He organized the FraxBUILD hackathon and has been shepherding a number of community led-initiatives\n* [one of many matts](https://twitter.com/1ofthemanymatts) is a conceptual artist, NFT OG, and applied crypto technologist. He's maintained OpenZeppelin and helped draft and audit its ERC721. He has most recently worked as the lead engineer of PleasrDAO.\n* [DECO](https://withdeco.studio/) ([Floguo](https://twitter.com/floguo) & [Sean Grindal](https://twitter.com/SeanGrindal)) are a designer and developer duo with extensive experience in Web3. They most recently assisted Flywheel in our [new website](https://flywheeldefi.com/) and brand redesign.\n\n### Future Opportunity\nThis $30k grant here will be credited to a discounted allocation of a future governance token. For example, if the Frax DAO decides to invest $250k in a potential $STICK token, then they would only need to put up $220k.\n\n### Proposal\n\n* For: Grant $30k of FXS to fund Sticker Protocol MVP\n* Against: Do Nothing",

      "title": "[FIP - 285] sFRAX Governance Proposal",
      "content": "### Authors\n\nFrax Core Team\n\n## Summary\n\nThis proposal introduces Staked FRAX (sFRAX) into the Frax ecosystem, allowing users to deposit FRAX stablecoins into a smart contract (Standard ERC-4626) and earn interest (denominated in FRAX stablecoins) on their holdings. Similar to the Dai Savings Rate (DSR) concept, sFRAX focuses on addressing the near-zero duration yield curve of FRAX, providing users with an opportunity to earn passive FRAX stablecoins while contributing to the growth of FRAX supply. sFRAX is not a guarantee of any yield or right to any redemption of on-chain or off-chain assets other than the FRAX stablecoins deposited and earned.\n\n## Background and Motivation\n\nThe concept of sFRAX aims to bridge the gap in the yield curve of FRAX by offering a low-duration savings option for users in a compliant ERC4626 token standard to integrate into protocols, bridges, cross-chain applications, and other useful places that can hold sFRAX and earn more FRAX stablecoins passively at the “Frax Staking Rate.” This will let users earn interest on FRAX stablecoin holdings without the risk associated with longer-duration onchain strategies. By introducing sFRAX, we envision an enhanced stablecoin ecosystem that encourages users to participate in earning rewards while stabilizing the protocol's supply dynamics. This move also aligns to promote greater liquidity in the protocol.\n\n## Details of sFRAX\n\nThe sFRAX contract will allow users to deposit their FRAX stablecoins to earn APR on their deposited FRAX holdings through earning newly minted FRAX stablecoins. Upon depositing FRAX, users will receive sFRAX tokens reflecting their proportional pool share (this is similar to the sfrxETH token). These tokens can be freely traded or transferred, allowing users to manage their yield-bearing assets effectively and for projects to build on top of sFRAX knowing that it is always akin to a yield-bearing FRAX stablecoin token.\n\nFrax Protocol will deposit the generated yields into the sFRAX Vault on a weekly basis. This consistent weekly deposit mechanism ensures that users' sFRAX holdings continue to accrue APR over time. The source of yield for sFRAX is not static or guaranteed to be from a single strategy. The protocol will allocate part of the revenues it earns from balance sheet deployment in AMOs and RWA strategies to supplying sFRAX yield to set the “Frax Staking Rate.” It will attempt to softly target (but not guarantee) the Federal Reserve Interest on Reserve Deposit Rate (IORB) at all times. If the protocol cannot return as much yield as the IORB, it will always attempt to keep the FRAX stablecoin fully collateralized 100% CR first, then return excess balance sheet revenues to sFRAX at the soft-target of the IORB (other than the current launch period where sFRAX has the current APR).\n\n## Voting\n\n* For: Deploy sFRAX contract and start Staked FRAX Program\n\n* Against: Do nothing.",

However, the recent approval of [SIP-54](https://vote.saddle.community/#/proposal/0x271aef6b1d04cf08878b33d304add4827da146dc7b1ca12d802a3922e29ad34b) on August 14, 2023, which decided to responsibly wind down the Saddle protocol, leads to a reevaluation of the operational aspects of the Saddle L2D4 pool. \n\nIn light of these developments, this proposal seeks to introduce a \"ragequit\" mechanism to the Saddle L2D4 pool Gauge on Arbitrum, designed with a 20% fee structure. This feature will offer liquidity providers an organized route to withdraw their assets from the pool, considering the evolving context driven by sunset of Saddle protocol.\n\n## Pool Details\n\nPool :          ARB: 0xF2839E0b30B5e96083085F498b14bbc12530b734\nLP Token : ARB: 0x147D0Af556C6D89640BFa915D2b9619d7b55947a\nGauge :      ARB: 0xd1dF24e8D225b20F9c8f4912BE88cCCec93f36E5\n\n## Vote\n\n• For: Implement the ragequit function for the Saddle L2D4 [Arbitrum] gauge with a 20% fee.\n• Against: Do Nothing",

      "content": "### Author\n\nOriginally Samuel Mcculloch, final Frax Core Devs Revision\n\n## Summary\n\nThis FIP proposes to acquire CRV using FRAX DAO treasury funds to support Frax's role in DeFi and increase liquidity across all FRAX/FrxETH/FPI pairs and rebalance part of FRAX DAO’s treasury funds. \n\n## Background and Motivation\n\nCurve Finance has garnered significant attention for facilitating efficient stablecoin trading. The recent exploit within the Curve Finance ecosystem, coupled with market dynamics, has led to a favorable CRV token price. This presents an advantageous window to accumulate CRV tokens.\n\nBy acquiring CRV tokens through an OTC deal, Frax aims to solidify its presence within the CRV ecosystem and tap into the growth potential of Curve Finance. This strategic move is driven by a forward-looking perspective that anticipates the expansion of Curve Finance and the potential value it can bring to Frax's ecosystem.\n\n## Proposal\nThis proposal suggests the OTC acquisition of CRV tokens using 1 million FRAX from the Frax DAO treasury at the same price as the prior OTC transactions conducted by Curve founder Mich. The acquired CRV will not be sold but instead staked in veCRV (through Frax’s whitelisted locker) and/or staked in cvxCRV. The CRV acquisition will enhance Frax's presence within the curve ecosystem and position the protocol for future growth.\n\n- For: OTC acquisition of CRV tokens, using 1 million FRAX from the Frax DAO treasury\n- Against: Do nothing",

      "title": "[FIP - 277] Onboard FinresPBC as FRAX v3's Offchain RWA Partner",
      "content": "### Author\nSam Kazemian\n\n## Background\n\nThe Frax Protocol needs a method to hold cash deposits and other low-risk cash-equivalent assets (such as reverse repo contracts and treasury bills) in order to execute its FRAX v3 RWA asset strategy. The Frax Core Developers have been working to create traditional financial infrastructure that can serve this purpose.\n\nEarlier this year, Financial Reserves and Asset Exploration Inc (dba [FinresPBC](https://finrespbc.com/)) was incorporated in the US state of Delaware as a public benefit C corporation to accomplish this mission.\n\nFinresPBC has been set up to be a conduit to accomplish this task for the Frax Protocol. FinresPBC is not a for profit entity: its incorporation documents state that its public benefit mission is to bring traditional financial assets (colloquially known as \"RWAs\") onchain for the benefit of the public. Thus, any yield generated from assets it holds on behalf of Frax Protocol will be returned to the protocol (minus costs/fees incurred to operate the public benefit business). Therefore, FinresPBC’s public mission is to provide the Frax Protocol access to safe cash-equivalent assets and near Fed rate yields for the benefit of all without seeking to make profit from this relationship or charge fees (other than to pay for minimum costs related to serving its mission). Additionally, FinresPBC's mission is to continue expanding its traditional infrastructure including meeting requirements for a Federal Reserve Master Account (FMA) in the future.\n\n**FinresPBC does *NOT* partake in any Frax Protocol development, smart contract engineering, or in any way participate in Frax Finance operations.** FinresPBC’s involvement and relationship to the Frax Protocol is solely restricted to holding cash-equivalent reserves and/or issuing token representation of such reserves. FinresPBC is **NOT** a developer lab or corporation responsible for or maintainer of the Frax Protocol smart contracts/open source code. \n\n**FinresPBC does *NOT* partake in any additional for profit activity or hypothecate reserves held for the Frax Protocol.** FinresPBC is not a profit maximizing organization. It's sole public benefit mission is to give onchain users access to offchain \"cash-equivalent RWAs.\" FinresPBC will not hypothecate, lend, pledge, or conduct business activity outside of its sole public mission to provide onchain access to offchain RWAs.\n\nFinresPBC's current banking partner is Lead Bank (lead.bank) an innovative regional bank that has opened its doors for crypto businesses to conduct safe, compliant traditional financial activity. FinresPBC is actively expanding its banking and financial relationships with compliant & crypto friendly financial partners (including full-service banks) and will announce new partners as appropriate. Any traditional financial entity that is interested in exploring a direct relationship, please reach out directly.\n\nCurrently, FinresPBC is capable of conducting the following for the Frax Protocol:\n1.) Hold US Dollar deposits in FDIC Insured IntraFi savings accounts & earn yield on such accounts.\n2.) Mint/Redeem Paxos USDP stablecoins & earn yield.\n3.) Mint/Redeem Circle USDC stablecoins & earn yield.\n4.) Hold/Purchase/Sell United States Treasury Bills in segregated brokerage accounts & earn yield.\n\n## Reporting, Auditing, & Attestations\nNo later than every month, FinresPBC will give a full asset breakdown and report of all reserves it holds for the Frax Protocol including expanded view of yields it has earned on such reserves as well as maintenance fees/costs incurred to hold such reserves and conduct such transactions.\n\nReports will be published publicly on this forum & sent to the Frax Core Developers to publish on Frax Facts and relevant protocol front end data sources deemed appropriate by the community.\n\n## Summary\nApprove FinresPBC to be FRAX v3's Offchain Partner & Custodian for the above mentioned transactions.\n\n## Proposal\n\n- **For: Onboard FinresPBC for FRAX v3**\n\n- **Against: Do Nothing**",

We at Flywheel want to take a bigger role in the governance of the Frax ecosystem which we can only do if we are whitelisted. We believe we are in a unique position at the nexus of community and advocacy to properly represent the will of those who decide to delegate to us.

We create Omni pools and issue zStables on top of them. \n\nzETH is ETH-pegged stablecoin with a rebase mechanism, collateralized by LP tokens from Zunami's ETH Omni pool and backed by ETH held in Curve pools. Our ETH Omni pool provide liquidity to the  frxETH pools on Curve, such as alETH/frxETH, stETH/frxETH, sETH/frxETH.\n\nBoth zETH and UZD are pool-aware tokens, meaning that when they are held in a Curve pool, the rebase feature is disabled, and all earnings are directed towards incentivizing that pool through bribes. This approach creates a self-sustainable economy, propelling zStables to the top of profitability charts.\n\n### Motivation:\nZunami actively supports the FRAX  and the evidence of our commitment lies in the value we already bring to the FRAX ecosystem through our UZD stablecoin:\n- TVL of our UZD/FRAXBP pool has surpassed $6 million, making us the 4th largest pool among FRAXBP pools.\n- We hold the position of being the largest briber on Votium among FRAXBP pools.\n- Our USD Omni pool has allocated over $3.2 million to pools paired with FRAXBP.\n\nWith the achievements we have accomplished so far, we are confident that we can replicate and amplify the same successes with frxETH.\n\n### Voting:\n\n* For: Add the zETH/frxETH pool to the FXS gauge controller\n* Against: Do nothing.",

      "content": "Author: MajeStyle, growth @ Gravita Protocol\n\nBackground:\n\nGravita is a borrowing platform based on Liquity that is focused on bringing interest-free borrowing to liquid staking token holders. Borrowing occurs by minting GRAI, the debt token of Gravita, which is burned when debts are repaid. Over-leveraged borrowers are liquidated via a stability pool, where GRAI holders can deposit.\n\nReferences/Useful links:\n\n- Gravita Website -> https://www.gravitaprotocol.com/\n- Gravita Documentation -> https://docs.gravitaprotocol.com/gravita-docs/\n\nMotivation:\n\nDeep liquidity for GRAI helps both to stabilize the price and facilitate borrowers. GRAI price will be further stabilized in the future with a redemption mechanism similar to Liquity. However, the system functions much better if the redemption mechanism is rarely used. Sourcing liquidity between GRAI and stablecoins like FraxBP is the primary bottleneck to the growth of Gravita and will be where the majority of resources go for the foreseeable future. That will start with protocol revenues, then governance tokens when the token launches.\n\nCurve Pool Address: 0x3175f54a354c83e8ade950c14fa3e32fc794c0dc\nToken: 0x15f74458aE0bFdAA1a96CA1aa779D715Cc1Eefe4\nCurve Gauge: 0x8d5af1f5dd3dc4b73e3a9af682adc3641fade9a5\n\nVoting:\n\nFor: Add the GRAI/FraxBP pool to the FXS gauge controller\n\nAgainst: Do nothing",

      "title": "[FIP - 267] Authorize Fraxlend AMO to Share Allocations Between v1 and v3 Lending Pairs",
      "content": "### Authors\n\nFrax Core Team\n\n## Summary\n\nThis proposal aims to grant the Fraxlend AMO permission to distribute its existing allocation limitations among both V1 and V3 FraxLend lending pairs. The main objective is to ensure a smooth migration from V1 to V3 by maximizing the utilization of the allocations already in place across both versions.\n\n## Background and Motivation\n\nAs we're getting set to launch more lending markets with Fraxlend V3 with Variable Rate V2, it's key to reexamine our capital allocation game plan to ensure a seamless move from V1 to V3. Currently, each Fraxlend V1 lending pair has its own allocation caps managed by Fraxlend AMO. But, with the upcoming arrival of new lending pairs in V3, we need a solid plan to manage these allocations effectively. This proposal aims to offer a smooth transition from V1 to V3, keeping user-experience top-notch and our platform running smoothly.\n\n## Details\n\nOur proposal is to give Fraxlend AMO the power to share its existing allocation limits between V1 and soon-to-launch V3 lending pairs. In simpler terms, the allocation cap for a specific lending pair could be shared between its V1 and V3 versions. By spreading these allocations across multiple versions, we can make the best use of capital and offer a hassle-free transition for our users.\n\nThe pairs we plan to roll out in V3 are:\n\n|Pair|Current Pair Address|\n| --- | --- |\n|WBTC/FRAX|0x32467a5fc2d72d21e8dce990906547a2b012f382|\n|WETH/FRAX|0x794f6b13fbd7eb7ef10d1ed205c9a416910207ff|\n|CVX/FRAX|0xa1d100a5bf6bfd2736837c97248853d989a9ed84|\n|FXS/FRAX|0xdbe88dbac39263c47629ebba02b3ef4cf0752a72|\n|CRV/FRAX|0x3835a58ca93cdb5f912519ad366826ac9a752510|\n|sfrxETH/FRAX|0x21e354da5d929a4da55428f6bfd71ed9ffd5001f|\n|gOHM/FRAX|0x66bf36dba79d4606039f04b32946a260bcd3ff52|\n|FPI/FRAX|0x74f82bd9d0390a4180daaec92d64cf0708751759|\n\n## Voting\n\n* For: Authorizing FraxLend AMO to share allocation limits between V1 and V3 lending pairs.\n\n* Against: Do nothing.",

      "content": "### Author\n\nBajanss (marketing service provider to the Sommelier protocol DAO)\n\n## Summary\n\nProposal to add the Fraxlend optimizer Fraximal vault token to the FXS gauge controller\n\n## Background and Motivation\n\nFraximal is a vault on [Sommelier](https://www.sommelier.finance/), an innovative asset management protocol whose mission is to make DeFi more accessible, profitable, and efficient for everyone. Sommelier’s advanced technology built on the Cosmos SDK enables intelligent vaults that can optimize portfolios, trade long-short, borrow-lend, and farm. Independent strategists can leverage the power of off-chain computation to inform on-chain vaults, allowing vaults to dynamically adapt to market conditions and provide enhanced opportunities and risk mitigation to users. All vaults are enabled by smart contracts [audited](https://www.sommelier.finance/audits) 0xMacro and controlled by protocol governance, ensuring transparency and security.\n\nThe Fraximal Facts.frax vault linkvault is different from other vaults in that it is intelligent, meaning it has the ability to predict, react, optimize and evolve to DeFi conditions whereas other vaults are static and limited to simple functions like auto-compounding or lending a single asset to one pool. The vault uses these intelligent capabilities to provide Frax depositors with the optimal yield available for collateralizing FRAX on Fraxlend. This is achieved through advanced modeling of past and real-time data from Fraxlend including interest curves, available liquidity, borrowed liquidity, and loan characteristics.\n\nIt can be complex, gas intensive, and time consuming to constantly track and react to the Fraxlend market movements. Fraximal aims to provide depositors with a simplified option to receive optimal yield on their FRAX while simultaneously being beneficial to the Fraxlend protocol. Increased FRAX deposits to Fraximal leads to more FRAX lending on Fraxlend. Deep liquidity on Fraxlend benefits the protocol in a number of ways including more liquid borrowing pools and a smoothing of borrow costs in high utilization pairs, both of which increases usage of Fraxlend.\n\nThe Fraximal vault launched on July 5th, 2023 and as of July 8th has attracted $1.3M of Frax liquidity and is the 7th largest lender on the protocol. The approval of an FXS gauge would aim to assist in attracting additional liquidity to the vault.\n\n### Links:\n\n* [Vault UI](https://app.sommelier.finance/strategies/Fraximal/manage)\n* [EtherScan Smart Contract](https://etherscan.io/address/0xdbe19d1c3f21b1bb250ca7bdae0687a97b5f77e6#readContract)\n* [Frax Facts vault link](https://facts.frax.finance/fraxlend/users/0xdbe19d1c3f21b1bb250ca7bdae0687a97b5f77e6)\n\n## Voting\n\n* For: Approve a gauge for the Fraxlend optimizer Fraximal vault token\n* Against: Do nothing",

The supply asset is sfrxeth and the borrowed asset is steth, which has a lower average APR. With a high LTV of 90%, we could enable 10x leverage on the interest rate differential. High LTVs would bring higher leverage, but I think it would be wise to see how the pair preforms during liquidations. \n\nOn the LTV, since these are interest rate differential products, I could see the LTV going up to 98% once the market develops enough. 10x is a good start, but high leverage is needed for good rate products.\n\nIts beneficial for both parties and also for generating more revenue for the protocol. With the new AMO providing liquidity into the steth/frxeth lp there should be enough liquidity to handle liquidations.\n\nI want to start this thread to start researching what demand might look like for this pair and also get feedback on lending parameters.\n\nWe also could add a sfrxETH/reth pair, which would be more profitable because the rETH yields are always the lowest. However, there is no rETH AMO and so liquidity issues could arise during liquidations.\n\n## Options\n- For: Deploy sfrxETH/stETH lending pair on Fraxlend in Ethereum mainnet\n- Against: Do nothing",

Furthermore, the TVL of the pool has only decreased since April 2022, leaving the pool currently at ~$2.9M TVL. Both facts highlight that the pool has had minimal adoption, making it an ineffective and non-productive way to direct capital.\n\nWith a 20% ragequit fee, community members will be allowed to exit their position and direct their capital to more productive avenues.\n\nAdditional Information\nIt is important to note that the Gelato network no longer looks after G-UNI pools as it was spun out into Arrakis Finance. There have also never been additional incentives for the gauge from Gelato's side.\n\n### Vote:\n- For: Implement the ragequit function for the FRAX/DAI Gelato LP pool with a 20% fee.\n- Against: Do nothing",

Among other assets, Metronome supports sfrxETH as collateral, and with over [$2mm in sfrxETH TVL](https://defillama.com/protocol/metronome-synth) on the application (roughly 25% of all TVL), the Frax community has certainly taken an interested in our protocol to amplify their yield and take out capital efficient, fixed rate loans against their various Frax positions.\n\nMetronome controls a significant CVX position and is additionally sending out significant bribes each epoch towards liquidity, including the msETH/frxETH pool. This will increase our ability to offer more opportunity to the Frax ecosystem to take advantage of the yield opportunities presented by Metronome.\n\n#### **msETH/frxETH Curve Pool**:\n\nCurve Pool Address: [link ](https://curve.fi/#/ethereum/pools/factory-v2-290/deposit)\n\nPool / Token : 0x2d600bbbcc3f1b6cb9910a70bab59ec9d5f81b9a\n\nGauge : 0xb7a3c519889a916c5ecb54101e69ecf11de60d0b\n\n## Vote\n\n* For: Add the msETH/frxETH Curve pool to the FXS gauge controller\n* Against: Do nothing",

      "content": "# Author\n\nDeFi Dave\n\n# Summary\n\nIncrease grant allocation from $214.2k to $267.2k ($53k total) to account for additional activities of Flywheel. Change the receiving of funds from llama Pay stream and lump sum at the end of the year to monthly payout, basing the price of FXS on the 30-day TWAP average from Fraxswap.\n\n# Background\n\nSince the passing of our grant renewal earlier this year, Flywheel has continued to provide intangible value to the Frax ecosystem. Along with staying consistent with our flagship media content, we have shepherded a number of initiatives including:\n\n* Hosting events and increasing awareness of Frax around the world which has received wide acclaim from attendees. These events allow us to connect with builders and spread awareness of Frax to users. \n* Organizing the Frax Ecosystem Education Program that has encouraged outsider contributors and researchers to proliferate Frax beyond Flywheel\n* Organizing and leading the FraxBuild Hackathon. Along with rallying developers to build in the Frax ecosystem but also interact with the core team in a meaningful way through workshops and office hours.\n\nA recent example Flywheel’s outsized impact to the Frax ecosystem was its key role in proliferating the Fraxchain news. What started as a conversation with Sam K on Flywheel we were able to package into a digestible story that was picked up by major news outlets and further discussed by key opinion leaders. Projects often hire whole marketing departments and PR firms in attempts to capture the same type of coverage yet Flywheel was able to do effortlessly due to the consistency of our content and firm long-term commitment to Frax.\n\n![|624x524](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard11/uploads/frax1/original/2X/8/8b519602991fd0168f76acd3c91272d1d0df3e68.jpeg)\n\n![|624x505](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard11/uploads/frax1/original/2X/0/0f0ba5081c733846eb4ae05de89aeade815c1fb1.jpeg)\n\n![|624x555](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard11/uploads/frax1/original/2X/f/f182713a9186fa82797abc54f73c4d0999fdd90b.png)\n\nFurthermore, as promised in our last [grant](https://gov.frax.finance/t/fip-178-flywheel-grant-renewal-for-2023/2068), we have started to diversify our revenue streams. In April of this year we received an $18k education grant from Frax ecosystem partner Brain DAO, are in the beginnings of selling merch, and started consulting. We continue to actively look for education grants that align with our mission of promoting the Frax ecosystem.\n\n# Review of Current Use of Funds\n\n* $104k to Flywheel\n  * Our flagship podcast Flywheel has continued to release episodes weekly. On this program, we have invited a wide-range of key opinion leaders ranging from builders to traders and everyone in between. Although this may not explicitly cover Frax, we perform what I like to call open-source advocacy with the guest whether it's explaining Frax to them or brainstorming collaborations on air. We have been able to hire a professional editor to help us streamline the process.\n* $52k to Frax Check\n  * We have stayed consistent with releasing weekly Frax Checks that review the performance of the protocol.\n* $25k to IRL Events\n  * Flywheel has been consistent in hosting events around the world. So far we have hosted happy hours in Denver, Tokyo, Hong Kong, and Seoul as well as a panel and workshop at Zuzalu. Coming up, we are planning events at Waterloo, Paris, and in NYC but after that our budget here will be almost if not depleted.\n* $15.6k in business development representation\n  * Although The TIE shuttered its SigDev portal program, DeFi Dave has still led and assisted Frax in business development activities. These efforts range from introducing the core team to prospective projects who want to enter the Frax ecosystem to representing Frax in Twitter Spaces and at future conferences such as Stable Summit and ETHcc.\n* $10k for Frax-branded merchandise\n  * Flywheel has created signature Frax merch for Denver and Tokyo and will continue to do so for future events. We will reallocate the money unused from Frax branded NFTs toward this category.\n* $5.1k for art and content\n  * Flywheel has used these funds to help create memes and fund for our Frax 101 efforts (deep dives, tutorials, and explainers).\n* $2.5k for Frax-branded NFTs\n  * After further research, we decided not to pursue this path. This money will be reallocated towards merch for the future.\n\n# Proposal Details\n\nItems in Grant\n\n* Events budget\n  * Events have proven to be an effective method of reaching out to the wide DeFi community and beyond in real life. Although we are halfway through the year, Flywheel has hosted 5 separate events and have 3 more planned in Waterloo (happening this week), Paris and New York.\n  * Although we have more events planned, we are asking for another **$15000** with the aim of hosting at least 2 more events in Singapore for Token2049 and Istanbul for DevConnect (totaling 10 for the year). Any extra funds available will be used to fund future meetups that have not been planned yet.\n* This Week in Frax and Frax Check\n  * Shortly after the passage of our last grant, we started releasing a new program called This Week in Frax which covers the events and conversations in the Frax Ecosystem over the past week.\n  * We propose to allocate $1000 per episode for This Week in Frax and change the cadence of Frax Check to a biweekly basis starting June 27th which totals **$36000**.\n* SamKazBot\n  * Before Flywheel, SamKazBot was famously touted as the “only tool used for Frax marketing”. At the beginning of the year, the bot went offline due to maintenance issues. In light of this, Flywheel took the initiative to rebuild and launch SamKazBot in May 2023.\n  * For this work and future work, we propose to allocate **$2000** for SamKazBot’s revival and maintenance.\n\n# Amendment of payout\n\n* Change payment from LlamaPay and lump sum at the end of the year to monthly basis starting in July. Split payment between FRAX and FXS 50/50 and use a 30-day TWAP that is at the discretion of the Frax Core team.\n* With the additional $53k, the total amount for the grant will be $267.2k.\n* Paid monthly starting July 8th, 2023, the total compensation will be $22.66k per month.\n\n# Motivation\n\nThis proposal aims to help Flywheel continue to function effectively as the media extension of the Frax ecosystem. By amending the payout, it will help Flywheel to continue to operate without a hitch and compensate us for completed work and future iniatives for the rest of the year. \n\nThe FRAX allocated towards this proposal is well within Frax’s budget that has [allocated](https://gov.frax.finance/t/fip-230-frax-finance-comprehensive-annual-budget-request-2023-2024/2342) $600k towards grants. In addition, we continue to align ourselves with the protocol by having half of the grant paid in FXS.\n\n# Proposal\n\n* For: Increase Flywheel Grant and change to monthly payout\n* Against: Do Nothing",

      "content": "### Authors\n\nFrax Core Team\n\n## Summary\n\nThis proposal seeks to establish percentage-based allocation caps for the frxETH Curve AMO allocation in frxETH curve pools. These caps, defined as a minimum and a maximum allocation cap for each pool, will guide the team's allocation decisions.\n\nThe proposed allocation caps for frxETH Curve AMO are:\n\nCurrent Allocation:\n\n* frxETH/ETH: Max 100% Min 100%\n\nProposed Allocation:\n\n* frxETH/ETH: Max 100% Min 50%\n* frxETH/stETH: Max 50% Min 0%\n\nThis means the team is mandated to maintain at least 50% of the allocation of the frxETH Curve AMO (withheld ETH) in the frxETH/ETH pool at all times but can allocate up to 50% to the frxETH/stETH pool if it is deemed advantageous.\n\nIt is important to clarify that the min/max caps specified in this proposal are separate from the \"withholding ratio.\" The caps are not intended to suggest that we are directing 100% of all ETH minted from frxETH to the AMO. The withholding ratio of ETH is a separate parameter. These max/min caps are put in place to govern the portion of the withheld ETH that will be allocated to the frxETH/ETH and stETH/frxETH pools within the AMO. more information about the current frxETH balance sheet can be found in [Frax Facts](https://facts.frax.finance/frxeth/balance-sheet).\n\n## Background and Motivation\n\nAutomated Market Operations (AMO) make Frax Finance one of the most potent stablecoin protocols, creating maximum flexibility and opportunity without altering the base stability mechanism. In Frax Ethereum, most of our Protocol Owned Liquidity (POL) resides on Curve, so setting clear allocation caps is crucial for managing our liquidity effectively and transparently in frxETH Curve AMO.\n\nOur current Frax Ethereum portfolio is primarily based on the frxETH/ETH pool, which has served us well thus far, ensuring liquidity and stability for our operations. However, as we cast our sights toward future expansion and robustness, it becomes essential to explore other potential avenues for diversification.\n\nstETH, being the largest and most demanded liquid staking derivative (LSD) on the market, brings a significant value proposition to the table. It provides liquidity nearly the same as ETH while generating an attractive yield, making the inclusion of stETH/frxETH a beneficial addition to our holdings.\n\nTherefore, the aim of this proposal is to set allocation caps that balance the benefits of incorporating stETH LP tokens into our portfolio while maintaining a strong position in our existing frxETH/ETH pool\n\n## Voting\n\n* For: Authorize frxETH Curve AMO to allocate funds in Curve pools based on the mentioned max and min authorized allocations.\n\n* Against: Do nothing.",

      "content": "## **Summary**\n\n5% of the FXS supply is in the hands of the Core Team Treasury to be deployed for the sole purpose of growing the Frax Protocol to become one of the most important cryptocurrency projects in the world.\n\nIn order to achieve that mission, we propose staking 4.5m FXS in veFXS for 6 months to attain yield and allocating that yield. We will use the veFXS yield to fund expansion of the team, bringing onboard community moderators/business developers/outreach, new developers, and create the Frax Grants+Incubator Program. The remaining 500k FXS not staked will be used for similar initiatives. This allows the treasury to fund these programs regardless if veFXS yield crashes or if there is a protracted bear market, allowing the Frax Protocol to continue its mission of becoming one of the most important protocols no matter what. \n\nAfter 6 months, this exact proposal (with any modifications/adjustments) will go live for another community vote before further allocation of funds so that the project team & extended contributors are held accountable to FXS tokenholders.\n\nThe core team will **NOT VOTE** using the staked veFXS or treasury address so this proposal will NOT affect the team's ability to sway governance in any way.\n\n## **Background**\n\nThe Frax Team Treasury is composed of 5m FXS. This treasury has largely been dormant for the first year of the Frax Protocol. Now that almost all FXS tokens have been released other than the community allocation through gauge emissions, we propose kickstarting the allocation of this treasury in a strategic manner to exponentially grow the pace of FRAX development & further decentralize the work, collaboration, and involvement of the extended community. \n\n## **Governance Proposal**\n\n- For: Deploy FXS Treasury to veFXS and fund team expansion, grants, incubator etc.\n- Against: Do nothing",

Details below.\n\n\n## **Introduction**\nThis is Ouroboros Capital. We are a liquid crypto fund that prides ourselves as vocal hands-on investors of our bags (FXS included).\n\nThe protocol has recently resumed its TWAMM FXS Buyback program again, kicking it off with a $2mn buyback over 6 months. I’m writing this proposal for us to consider parameters to which we can optimize for to design a much better buyback program.\n\n## **Objective of Buyback**\nTo start, we have to first understand what the buybacks are attempting to achieve. To put it simply, the buyback program’s objective is for the protocol to accumulate $FXS at prices which it deems $FXS to be undervalued. This delivers a spectrum of benefits including but not limited to 1) POL value accretion, 2) signaling a valuation floor to the market which consequently helps the protocol with more economic use of $FXS as incentives, 3) warehousing $FXS at cheap prices to be used in the future as it grows it value, etc. \n\n## **Optimize for Acquiring $FXS at Low Prices**\nNow that we’ve established that the objective of the buybacks are to buy $FXS cheap and signal a psychological price floor to market, I would like to propose parameters which would help optimize for that. **I am proposing for a more aggressive TWAMM that increases in magnitude at lower levels but also stop buying $FXS at a higher levels.**\n\n## **What is The Right Size and Price?**\nHistorically the TWAMM buyback have been the most effective at establishing a price floor between the $4-5 level. A level that we should also agree is only more of a value floor as time passes given the growth of the protocol Frax v1 to Frax v2 AMO, Fraxlend, FraxFerry, FrxETH, etc. As such I recommend the program to target these price levels given the historical context.\n\n![Picture1|602x376](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard11/uploads/frax1/original/2X/9/921553651feb8908ede819505e900ea294152f07.png)\n\nHowever, it is evident that these price levels are not visited for long. Since the introduction of the TWAMM buyback program last year, the price range of $4-5 has only been visited for 74 days. A mere ~20% of the days in the year. We will not be able to efficiently capture the value that presents itself if the TWAMM is spread across a period such as 6 months. Instead, I propose a $1mn TWAMM that spans over 1-month (30 days), buying only when price is below $5 and an additional $1mn 1-month TWAMM on top of it that starts buying only when price is below $4. We are proposing a 30-day period given it covers the lengths of time that has previously dipped the $5 level. See image and appendix below. The upper price limits circumvents the protocol chasing FXS higher and stops once the original objective of establishing a price floor has been achieved.\n\nThis more aggressive buyback would 1) create a stronger signaling to the market and 2) allow the protocol to more promptly capture these rare value windows.\n\n## **Digesting Existing Sell Flow**\nIt is worth highlighting too that the Uniswap and FraxSwap pools have seen an increase in ~74K $FXS since 5 days ago when price dipped below $5. Assuming $5 FXS, this is ~$370K of FXS sold in 5 days (~$2.2mn in 30 days) which the above proposed $2mn TWAMM should be able digest.\n\nI welcome any suggestions and hope as a community we can work towards designing a better buyback program.\n\n## Vote:\n- For: Optimizing FIP-77’s TWAMM Parameters based on two mentioned strategies\n- Against: Do nothing\n\n### **Appendix**\nPrior Dates since FIP-77 when $FXS is below $5: \n- 7-9 Jun '22 (2 days)\n- 13-20 Jun '22 (7 days)\n- 28 Jun - 5 Jul '22 (7 days)\n- 12-14 Jul '22 (2 days)\n- 20 Sep - 8 Oct '22 (18 days)\n- 12 Nov - 5 Dec '22 (23 days)\n- 22 Dec '22 - 6 Jan '23 (15 days)",

These factors contribute to suboptimal lending conditions, potentially exposing the protocol and/or its users to higher risk levels.\n\nThe present proposal suggests the introduction of a 50% fee on all sunset pairs. And the rationale behind this is to further reduce the economic appeal of these pairs and redirect users towards more active and efficient lending pairs. \n\n## Vote\n- For: Set fees at 50% for all sunset pairs on Fraxlend\n- Against: Do nothing",

After observing submissions and the evolving needs of the type of awareness that we want to prioritize, we would like to make several changes.\n\n\n## Proposal Details\n\nWe propose to make the following amendments:\n\n* Last month, we saw the monthly allocation surpass its limit of $10k to $12.25k. We used $2.25k from Month 3 to pay Month 2 participants fully. This will leave $7.75k allocated for Month 3. To address this issue, we propose implementing a dynamic reward system, capped by a reward table. However, in instances where the monthly budget is surpassed, the rewards will be reduced proportionally to the exceedance ratio. This ensures that each month's budget remains within the allocated limit.\n\n* Extend the program for another 6 months starting after the end of Month 3, July 12th, with allocation of $12k per month.\n\n* In the past two months, we've observed a high level of participation in the written category, a decent level of engagement in the thread category, and a lower participation rate in the video category. Given this trend, we propose to re-balance the reward structure.\n  * Decrease rewards for both written article categories from $250 to $100\n  * Decrease rewards for Twitter thread categories from $250 to $200 and $500 to $400\n  * Decrease infographic rewards from $250 to $150 and $500 to $300\n  * Change the video category from being “reach 10,000 views on a video” to “create tutorial video about anything Frax related” and have the reward be $250. The video category of reaching 1,000 views on a video remains the same.\n\n* Over the past two months, we have seen decent participation in dashboard creation. However, we have also observed instances of duplicated efforts and submissions of dashboards that do not provide substantial value. To enhance the efficiency and quality of submissions in this category, we propose introducing a pre-approval step for ideas before their application. This means that before embarking on the creation of a dashboard, participants will first submit their ideas for approval.\n\n|Category|Platform|Indicator|Reward|\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|Dashboard|Dune Analytics|Build a dashboard with at least 4 query visualizations that has information that is not available on Frax Facts.|$500- $1500|\n|Written|Miscellaneous|Publish an article directed at a beginner audience|$100|\n|Written|Miscellaneous|Publish an article directed at an intermediate/advanced audience|$100|\n|Video|YouTube|Reach 1,000 views on a video explaining Frax|$250|\n|Video|YouTube|Create a tutorial about a Frax ecosystem primitive or stablecoin|$250|\n|Thread|Twitter|Reach 10,000 views on a single thread of at least 8 tweets|$200|\n|Thread|Twitter|Reach 50,000 views on a single thread of at least 8 tweets|$400|\n|Infographic|Twitter|Reach 10,000 views on a single infographic|$150|\n|Infographic|Twitter|Reach 50,000 views on a single infographic|$300|\n\n## Proposal\n\n* For: Authorize Frax Education Program amendments and extension\n* Against: Do Nothing",

      "content": "## **Summary**\n\n- Add the future FRAX/ETH pool on Swaap v2 to FXS gauge controller\n\nThe proposal will provide FRAX with the following benefits:\n\n- Reinforce FRAX as a “connector token” within DeFi\n- Improve FRAX-ETH execution by creating a direct liquidity venue (lower gas, lower spread)\n- Deepen liquidity on FRAX\n- Create a new yield opportunity for FRAX holders\n\n## **Background about the protocol**\n\nSwaap v2 is a non-custodial RfQ market-making infrastructure offering optimal liquidity services, launching soon.\n\nMarket making in crypto is split between centralized & opaque actors & transparent AMMs that yield negative returns for their LPs. Swaap v2 brings the best of both worlds - profitable, open, transparent, non-custodial, composable, secure, & adaptive.\n\nSwaap v1, launched in June 2022 on Polygon, proved that profitable onchain market making was possible. Its WBTC / WETH / USDC pool underwent less than 0.1% in Impermanent Loss.\n\nSwaap v2 is set to further improve this by making the best market making models available onchain, focused on higher yield strategies. It also introduces new security standards in DeFi such as the onchain max-drawdown.\n\nFor further information, please refer to Swaap v2 [whitepaper](https://www.swaap.finance/v2-whitepaper.pdf).\n\n## **Why it’s good for FRAX**\n\nIncrease demand & liquidity for FRAX in a transparent and sustainable way:\n\n- Launching a FRAX-ETH pair on Swaap v2 would improve FRAX-ETH execution by creating a direct liquidity venue. Today, a FRAX to ETH swap usually goes through Curve FRAX <> USDC and then Uniswap v3 USDC <> ETH. This represents an increased cost in terms of execution (spread) and gas fees. Having a direct pool on Swaap v2 would reduce such costs (notably on the gas fees side)\n- This improved execution would not need to be incentivized as much as it would be the case on an AMM like Uniswap v3 to compensate the Impermanent Loss as the pools are built to be profitable for LPs.\n- The liquidity would be deepened on FRAX in case of extreme events\n- Creating this direct route FRAX <> ETH would reinforce FRAX as a “connector token” within DeFi, and potentially attract volume from other DAO tokens which could pair their assets against FRAX.\n- As Swaap v2 pools are built to be profitable, this is an opportunity to create a new yield opportunity for FRAX holders. Besides, as ERC-20 tokens, Swaap v2 LP positions are highly composable and can appeal to a wide range of profiles once integrated into structured products.\n\n## **Vote**\n\n- For: Add the future FRAX/ETH pool on Swaap v2 to FXS gauge controller\n- Against: Do nothing",

      "content": "#### Author(s)\n\nGMO Trust\n\n\n### Summary\n\nProposal to add the ZUSDFRAXBP to the FXS gauge controller.\n* Curve Pool [Link](https://curve.fi/#/ethereum/pools/factory-v2-305/deposit)\n* Pool Type: Factory pool FraxBP Metapool\n* Tokens: ZUSD and FraxBP LP\n* GMO Trust (ZUSD Issuer) (stablecoin.z(dot)com/company/)\n* ZUSD Website (stablecoin.z(dot)com/zusd/)\n* Twitter (twitter(dot)com/GMOTrust)\n* Etherscan (etherscan(dot)io/token/0xc56c2b7e71B54d38Aab6d52E94a04Cbfa8F604fA)\n* Monthly Transparency Attestation Reports (stablecoin.z(dot)com/attestation/)\n* Technical Audit github(dot)com/trust-zcom/gmotrust-stablecoin-contract/tree/master/audit_reports)\n* Whitepaper (stablecoin.z(dot)com/assets/pdf/Whitepaper.pdf)\n* Fee Schedule (stablecoin.z(dot)com/fee-schedule/)\n* Github (github(dot)com/trust-zcom)\n\n### Background and Motivation\n\nThis pool needs incentivization because the DeFi ecosystem would greatly benefit from increased diversity of fiat-backed stablecoin options. There are effectively only three viable options: USDC, USDT, and USDP. Two out of the three are under the jurisdiction of the US, which poses real systematic risks in the current regulatory environment. Though ZUSD is incredibly thorough with its regulatory policy (with permits and licenses to operate and serve US customers), GMO Trust is firmly part of a Japanese company.\n\n* ZUSD is a fiat-backed stablecoin with 1:1 redeemability with a total supply of 16,132,265.\n* ZUSD is currently tradeable on these decentralized exchanges: Uniswap and Curve pools.\n* ZUSD engages market makers and trading desks such as Hudson River Trading, GSR, Keyrock, JST Digital, and Profluent.\n* GMO Trust Company is a subsidiary of GMO Internet Group, an Internet service industry leader, developing and operating Japan’s most widely used domain, hosting & cloud, e-commerce, security, and payment solutions. The Group also includes the world’s largest online FX trading platform, as well as online advertising, Internet media, and cryptocurrency-related services. GMO Internet Group, Inc. (TSE: 9449) is headquartered in Tokyo, Japan.\n* GMO Trust Company connects traditional finance and blockchain for everyone. We are issuing GYEN, the world’s first regulated Japanese YEN-pegged stablecoin, and ZUSD, the new digital dollar. Established in 2020, [GMO-Z.com](http://gmo-z.com/) Trust Company was granted a limited-purpose trust charter by the New York State Department of Financial Services and is a subsidiary of the financial and IT conglomerate GMO Internet Group from Japan.\n\n\n### Vote\n\n* For: Add ZUSD/FRAXBP Curve pool to FXS gauge controller\n* Against: Do nothing",

Our infrastructure enables dApp users to interact with any asset or application, on any chain, with one click. Axelar goes far beyond sending wrapped assets with General Message Passing, which carries any payload securely cross-chain. Applications can call any function on any connected chain and deliver a one-click experience for users on any other connected chain.

The Frax team has offered to contribute to the bribes of this pool.

      "content": "**Allocate 60000 $vlCVX votes for fETH/FRAXBP for 6 months**\n\n**Authors**\n\nf(x) Core Team\n\n### **Summary**\n\nAllocate 60000 $vlCVX votes for fETH/FRAXBP for 6 months. In exchange, f(x) will offer Frax 4,000 FX tokens (0.2% of supply) vested linearly over 12 months from the first vote\n\n### **Background**\n\nf(x) Protocol creates two ETH derivative assets, one with stablecoin-like low volatility and the second a leveraged long ETH perpetual token.  These tokens are created by separating pure ETH collateral into a lower-volatility component (beta<1) called fractional ETH (fETH) and a higher-volatility (beta>1) one called leveraged ETH (xETH).  By constraining beta=0.1 the fractional ETH token captures some growth of the cryptocurrency market while limiting volatility enough to retain the characteristics of a stablecoin. The leveraged ETH component is essentially a long perpetual future contract with zero funding costs and variable leverage. With only pure ETH collateral the system is not exposed to centralized risk.  Maximum liquidity of fETH can scale quickly compared with CDP-issued stablecoins because it is based on the high demand for leveraged long ETH positions (xETH) rather than the relatively lower demand for CDPs, with their attendant maintenance and capital inefficiency.\n\nMore details can be found in [f(x) white paper](https://github.com/AladdinDAO/aladdin-v3-contracts/blob/main/audit-reports/f(x)%20whitepaper.pdf).\n\n### **f(x) Tokenomics**\n\nFX is f(x)’s native token and it uses Curve’s ve- tokenomic system, with lockers sharing platform revenue and progressively increasing governance power. f(x) charges fees to minting and redeeming of fETH/xETH tokens and at least 50% of which will be distributed to veFX holders. This makes liquidity mining (or bribe payments) more sustainable than simple inflation because FX is a proxy for real, ongoing platform revenue. Locking FX is marketed as a set-and-forget way to earn ETH over time.\n\nMore details can be found in [f(x) tokenomics article](https://medium.com/@protocol_fx_667/f-x-protocols-tokenomics-offer-a-calculated-journey-towards-success-b97487df41b9).\n\n### **Motivation**\n\nIncreasing liquidity and visibility for the fETH/FRAXBP pool will be extremely helpful to the operation of f(x). It would also be beneficial and additive to f(x) and Frax ecosystem in the following ways:\n\nf(x) provides unique new farming opportunities for Aladdin and Frax communities;\n\nfETH gets good liquidity support and it expands utility for FRAX as well. This creates a strong win-win situation for both the f(x) and Frax ecosystem. \n\n### **Proposal**\n\nIn order to create a deeper pool and to attract liquidity which will support fETH/FRAXBP, we propose that Frax vote with 60,000 vlCVX for the fETH/FRAXBP pool for 6 months on Votium. In exchange, f(x) will offer Frax 4,000 FX tokens (0.2% of supply) vested over 12 months from the first vote.\n\n- **For**: Allocate 60000 $vlCVX votes for fETH/FRAXBP for 6 months.\n\n- **Against**: Do nothing",

      "title": "[FIP - 239] FRAX <> Convergence - Seed investment proposal",
      "content": "Dear Frax community,\n\nWe would like to propose a seed investment to the DAO, as our intent as a protocol is to be deeply involved within the Curve/Frax ecosystem.\n\n**I. Introduction to the Convergence protocol**\n\nBefore jumping into the proposal (or the docs), we kindly suggest reading this article that breaks down the entire protocol: https://medium.com/cvgfinance/convergers-to-the-void-12e2b4e4cbde\n\nConvergence is an agnostic “Convex-like” layer, that aims to be deployed on top of various protocols, starting with Tokemak. In addition to the well-known “Convex-like” behavior of aggregation/optimization of underlying protocols, Convergence also gathers mechanisms inspired from Curve, and Olympus. Gauges and veTokenomics will be used to drive emissions, and a *Bonding Program* has been established. Using bonds to build Protocol Owned Liquidity (POL) and a diversified treasury will allow Convergence to ensure self-sustainalibity, but also to reward token holders with an intrinsic incentive mechanism that does not rely on underlying protocols’ aggregation. \n\nOverall, Convergence will:\n- Aggregates protocols and operate metagovernance (governance of underlying protocols) like Convex;\n- Operates its own governance and direct emissions like Curve;\n- Issues discounted CVG through bonds like Olympus;\n- Deploys the treasury and rewards CVG lockers.\n\nBelow is a brief breakdown of the 3 primary pillars of Convergence.\n\n**Aggregations:**\nStarting with Tokemak (https://twitter.com/TokenReactor)Documentation: https://docs.cvg.finance/staking/convergence-for-tokemak\n\nEach staking contract will be paired to a gauge and will be able to receive CVG emissions. Staking positions are tokenized. The governance power held by Convergence over Tokemak is delegated to CVG lockers (via mgCVG). Metagovernance will be operated on Snapshot.\n\nFor TOKE stakers: deposit and convert TOKE to cvgTOKE. Underlying TOKE are split between regular TOKE staking and TOKE locking (accTOKE). TOKE and wETH rewards are distributed to cvgTOKE stakers (with CVG on top according to the cvgTOKE gauge weight). Convergence will deploy and manage a cvgTOKE/TOKE stable pool on Curve. Various peg-defense mechanisms are planned.\n\nFor Liquidity Providers: staking of tAssets (Tokemak’s LP). All tAssets are then socialized in a *Black Hole* that claims all TOKE rewards in one go once a week. Tokemak’s native TOKE distribution is then overwritten, and TOKE rewards are distributed back to tAssets stakers according to each tAsset relative gauge weight. CVG will be added on top of TOKE rewards, according to gauge weights.\n\n**Bonds & Treasury:**\nDocumentation (bonds): https://docs.cvg.finance/bonds-and-treasury/bonds\nDocumentation (treasury): https://docs.cvg.finance/bonds-and-treasury/treasury\n\nWe use a 100% homemade bond technology. It relies on a custom and generic on-chain Oracle paired to Chainlink price feeds, that doesn’t allow negative ROI by design. Bonds will be used to acquire stablecoins (FRAX and crvUSD) and Curve ecosystem assets (CRV, CVX, FXS, FPIS, CNC, SDT, TOKE etc). The treasury will then be deployed in the Curve ecosystem on various protocols, and rewards will be harvested at least every 2 weeks. Every 3 months, 80% of these rewards will be distributed to CVG lockers as a real yield, paid in CRV, CVX, CNC, FXS and SDT (FPIS can be added to the cohort). A zap function will be available. Bonding positions, like staking positions, are tokenized.\n\n**Locking mechanism** (*Govearn*):\nDocumentation: https://docs.cvg.finance/cvg-token/cvg-locking\n\nCVG lockers govern the protocol, direct emissions, operate metagovernance, and earn 80% of the yield generated by the working treasury. CVG can be locked up for a maximum of 96 weeks (almost 2 years). Locking positions are tokenized as an NFT (ERC-721).\n\nWhen CVG is locked, three *locking primitives* can be created:\n- **veCVG**: forked from veCRV, used for gauge votes and governance (https://docs.cvg.finance/cvg-token/cvg-locking/understanding-vecvg):\n- **mgCVG**: stands for *metagovernance* CVG, comparable to vlCVX, used for Snapshot metagovernance votes (https://docs.cvg.finance/cvg-token/cvg-locking/understanding-mgcvg);\n- **ysCVG**: stands for *yield sharing* CVG, represents a *claiming right* on treasury profits distributed every three months (https://docs.cvg.finance/cvg-token/cvg-locking/understanding-yscvg).\n\nWhen a user creates a locked position, he can choose to lock CVG for veCVG and/or ysCVG. The percentage of CVG that will be allocated to compute both amounts can be customized for every position (50/50, 80/20, 0/100, 100/0…). Locking to veCVG will generate mgCVG. Locking to ysCVG only won’t generate any mgCVG. In other terms, users who lock CVG will have to arbitrate between governance and profit sharing, governance being represented by veCVG/mgCVG, and profit sharing by ysCVG. Delegation has been established for each *primitive*.\n\nTokenomics: https://docs.cvg.finance/cvg-token/tokenomics\nDiagram of the financial flows: https://docs.cvg.finance/general-information/protocol-overview/financial-flows-basics\n\n**II. Interactions and direct synergies with Frax**\n\nAirdrop:\nEvery protocol holding TOKE will be airdroped, proportionally to its TOKE holding. Therefore, Frax will be receiving the highest allocation among DAOs holding TOKE.\n\nDAOs allocations will be distributed at launch, in the form of full governance locked positions (100% veCVG/mgCVG), to incentivize governance participation.\n\nFrax protocol participants will also be able to claim an individual airdrop after launch (TBD).\n\nStaking:\ntFRAX and tFXS holders will be able to stake their tAsset within Convergence, to earn CVG in addition to TOKE.\n\nAnd easy-to-go UX will allow direct deposits of FRAX and FXS on Convergence, instead of tFRAX and tFXS.\n\nEmission direction:\nveCVG holders will be able to direct both TOKE and CVG emissions to the tFRAX and tFXS staking contracts. The fact that Convergence overwrites native TOKE rewards will allow TOKE emission to be directed through gauge votes, which is not possible natively on Tokemak.\n\nBond offering:\nUsers will be able to buy CVG at a discount against FRAX and FXS.\n\nTreasury rewards:\nysCVG holders will be able to receive FXS (and potentially FPIS) as rewards earned from treasury deployments.\n\nMetagovernance and rewards:\nBy holding locked positions, Frax may be able to:\n- direct CVG emission to staking contracts;\n- hold governance power over multiple protocols;\n- earn CRV, CVX and CNC, extending Frax influence over the Curve ecosystem.\n\nFundraising:\nWe are raising on-chain, and we accept DAI and FRAX only (contract: https://etherscan.io/address/0x06feb7a047e540b8d92620a2c13ec96e1ff5e19b).\n\nIn the future:\nAfter Tokemak, we have 3 additional aggregations planned. The work for the 2nd one is already in progress, and the code should be done within a month. These 3 aggregations target protocols that are heavily involved within the Curve ecosystem. Once all 4 aggregations will be done, the DAO will vote to choose which protocol should be integrated next.\n\nEach aggregation will have direct interactions with Frax. The 2nd aggregation will allow Frax users to stake liquid derivatives of veFXS and veFPIS, while enjoying boosted bribe yield, in addition to CVG incentives on top. It will also be possible to stake Curve LPs, such as frxETH/ETH or FRAX/USDC, to earn boosted yield, and still, CVG incentives on top. \n\nIt is also possible to imagine a direct Frax integration within Convergence, built on a different model than those made by Convex and Stake DAO. Such an aggregation would require sufficient voting power on Curve, to be properly bootstrapped.\n\nOverall, our goal is to create a symbiotic relationship between Frax and Convergence, that would be similar to the one between Frax and Convex.\n\n**III. Security**\n\nTesting process:\nPrior to audit, we conducted an extensive testing program, using our own private testnet. In a few words, we forked the mainnet and we deployed an Etherscan-like solution on top called Ethernal. Then, we established test scenarios, that we played directly on the frontend. The purpose of this testing process was mostly to ensure that the logic was right, and that the code was behaving as expected.\n\nMore infos in this article: https://medium.com/cvgfinance/testing-sagittarius-0x-7b9265dc66d6.\n\nAudit:\nThe code is being audited by Halborn (https://twitter.com/HalbornSecurity) since the 24th of April. According to them, the audit should be finished by the 9 of June. So far, they didn’t identify any critical issue.\n\nAudit competition:\nOnce the audit with Halborn will be fully finished (a few return trips are possible to correct potential problems after reporting), we will launch an audit competition on [Hats.Finance](http://Hats.Finance) (https://app.hats.finance/vaults).\n\n**IV. Terms**\n\nSeed FDV: $19.5M\n\nVesting: 120 days cliff, 5% released post cliff, followed by a 15 months linear vesting, with releases every 45 days.\n\nWe are proposing a $100,000 investment, made with FRAX. It would represent 769,230 CVG (0,51% of the total supply).\n\nMost notable investors: \nKaizen DAO (https://twitter.com/kaizen_dao), NGC Ventures (https://twitter.com/NGC_Ventures), Prismatic Capital (https://twitter.com/PrismaticCap), Blockhub DAO (https://twitter.com/BlockhubDao), deWhales Capital (https://twitter.com/DewhalesCapital), MrBlock ([@mrblocktw](https://www.mrblock.tw/)) and a core team member of Curvance (https://twitter.com/Curvance).\n\nThanks for reading.\n\n# Vote:\n- For: Investment of 100,000 FRAX for 769,230 CVG with 120 days cliff, 5% released post cliff, followed by a 15 months linear vesting, with releases every 45 days.\n- Against: Do nothing.",

      "title": "[FIP - 238] Frax Lend ITB Risk Management Tools",
      "content": "Author: IntoTheBlock Research\nMay 31, 2023\n\n## Summary\n\nIntoTheBlock (ITB) is requesting a grant to build the following set of risk management solutions for Frax Lend and its community:\n\n1. An open dashboard monitoring general and pool-specific risk indicators\n2. CSV downloads of underlying data for all indicators\n3. API access for core contributors to access data\n4. Documentation covering Frax Lend’s risk dynamics\n\nThe dashboard would be hosted on ITB’s risk radar product (currently the Alpha phase is [available here](https://defirisk.intotheblock.com/)) and also as a section within the [FraxFacts site](https://facts.frax.finance/fraxlend). Each indicator’s data would be openly available for Frax users to keep track of and mitigate economic risks. These metrics are particularly relevant to attract institutional investors and are based on ITB’s experience managing risks on nine figures for some of crypto’s largest balance sheets.\n\nOn a quarterly basis IntoTheBlock’s team would add support for more pools added to Frax Lend and update metrics accordingly.\n\n## Abstract\n\nIntoTheBlock has been deeply involved in DeFi over the past two years. This began with the launch of DeFi Insights analytics and grew substantially through its institutional quantitative strategies ([ITB Quant](https://intotheblock.finance/)) service. ITB’s DeFi Quant Platform serves as the gateway used by over 20 of the largest crypto institutions to access DeFi yields via sophisticated quantitative strategies with corresponding risk management models.\n\nTo help streamline institutional adoption of DeFi, IntoTheBlock decided to enable access to its risk indicators and models via APIs and analytics dashboards. The objective of this proposal is to build these risk models and have them openly available for Frax Lend’s institutional and retail investors.\n\n## Motivation\n\nRisk monitoring and management is paramount for any financial service. The recent events in the DeFi market have proven that risk management is essential to catalyze the growth of the space. At ITB we believe that risk management in DeFi should be done out in the open, following crypto’s ethos, and not be a luxury expense.\n\nFollowing ITB’s experience safeguarding hundreds of millions into DeFi through advanced risk management models, we believe that expanding these tools and offering them to Frax Lend would help make DeFi safer over the mid- to long-term. Enabling real time economic risk monitoring for Frax Lend should be an important element to provide confidence to institutional and retail investors.\n\n## Specification & Implementation\n\nIntoTheBlock is requesting $60,000 to build near real-time economic risk monitoring and analytics for the Frax Lend protocol. Specifically, the grant will cover the following deliverables:\n\n* Economic Risk API: REST API enabling access to dozens of economic risk indicators in the Frax Lend protocol.\n* Economic Risk Dashboard: Web interface that includes visualizations of the most important risk indicators.\n* Documentation: Complete documentation of all risk indicators included in the release.\n\nThese deliverables will be split into three main milestones, requesting $15k to be paid upon completion of each plus $15k upfront and a $15k annual maintenance fee.\n\n## Frax Lend ITB Grant Milestones & Payments:\n\n1. Upfront payment ($15k)\n2. Indicators 1-6 (dashboard + API) ($15k)\n3. Indicators 7-11 (dashboard + API) ($15k)\n4. Documentation covering Frax Lend’s risk dynamics and indicators ($15k)\n\nThis release will include the risk indicators [outlined in this document](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Uzas_-yY9E8xC2htumsK2cDditClGDI9h_gLE5hXqC4/edit?usp=sharing) for the 15 assets supported as collateral on the Frax Lend protocol at the time of writing. The following Figma mock-ups made by ITB’s design team demonstrates how the proposed layout would look like within the [ITB risk product](https://www.figma.com/proto/RWSQKqLhgqQofukEDkIVyq/%5BWIP%5D-ITB-Risk-Radar?page-id=4476%3A96472&type=design&node-id=4498-93397&viewport=1059%2C-384%2C0.14&scaling=min-zoom&starting-point-node-id=4516%3A95975&show-proto-sidebar=1&hide-ui=1) and on the[ Frax Facts platform](https://www.figma.com/proto/RWSQKqLhgqQofukEDkIVyq/%5BWIP%5D-ITB-Risk-Radar?page-id=4476%3A96472&type=design&node-id=4498-94163&viewport=548%2C-424%2C0.14&scaling=min-zoom&starting-point-node-id=4498%3A93881&show-proto-sidebar=1&hide-ui=1). (Keep in mind that this does not yet include live data from protocol and is just for reference).\n\nThese indicators are subject to modification based on feedback from the community and Frax Lend’s team. The ITB team is committed to upgrading these indicators as Frax Lend expands and to incorporate the community’s feedback to make these risk tools more useful over time. For this ongoing maintenance, ITB requests an additional $15k fee annually.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIntoTheBlock’s proposal looks to enable real time economic risk monitoring for the Frax Lend protocol. The risk indicators included in this proposal are based on IntoTheBlock’s experience managing and monitoring risk for Frax Lend and similar protocols. The initial release is an attempt to democratize access to sophisticated risk models for all investors participating in the Frax Lend protocol.\n\n# Vote\n- For: Accepting IntoTheBlock (ITB) grant request for building a risk management solutions for Fraxlend (Grant size: $60,000)\n- Against: Do nothing.",

      "title": "[FIP - 230] Frax Finance Comprehensive Annual Budget Request (2023 - 2024)",
      "content": "### Authors\n\nFrax Core Team\n\n## Summary\n\nThis proposal aims to authorize a **maximum** annual budget of **9,000,000 FRAX** for Frax Finance. This budget is intended to cover five key categories: development and operation, Security, Grant, Reserve Emergency Fund, and Legal & Compliance. Please note that this is a maximum cap, and it is highly likely that not all of it will be used.\n\n## Background and motivation\n\nAt this stage in Frax Finance's growth trajectory, the destructive impact of capital limitations cannot be overstated. We focus on stimulating growth, driving innovation, and addressing potential legal and security challenges. The proposed maximum annual budget reflects these priorities, having been informed by carefully analyzing our past financial strategies and those of other successful protocols. Our goal is to create a robust financial system that allows us to respond to changes swiftly, seize opportunities, and ensure the continued growth and resilience of our protocol.\n\n## Details\n\n### Budget Categories\n\n1. **Development and Operation:** This budget will be used to cover the costs associated with the development and operation of the Frax Finance protocol. This could include salaries for developers, costs of new feature development, maintenance costs, infrastructure costs, and other operational expenses.\n\n2. **Security (Audits and Bug Bounty):** This budget is allocated to maintaining the security of the Frax Finance protocol. This includes the costs of regular security audits by external firms, running a bug bounty program to incentivize the discovery and reporting of vulnerabilities and other measures to ensure the safety and trust of our community.\n\n3. **Grants:** This budget will fund grants for projects or initiatives that contribute to the Frax Finance ecosystem. This could include funding for independent developers or teams building on Frax, research initiatives, educational content, community events, and more (e.g., [Frax Ecosystem Educational Incentives](https://gov.frax.finance/t/fip-208-frax-ecosystem-educational-incentives/2235)).\n\n4. **Reserve Emergency Fund:** This budget is a financial safety net for unforeseen circumstances. It can respond to unexpected events, such as sudden market changes, emergency protocol upgrades, or other contingencies that require immediate financial resources.\n\n5. **Legal and Compliance:** This budget covers legal and compliance costs to ensure that Frax Finance operates within the legal framework. This could include fees for legal counsel, regulatory compliance costs, potential legal disputes, and other related expenses.\n\n### Budget Allocation\n||Proposed Budget Share Percentage|Proposed Annual Max Caps|Latest Annual Allocations <br>(2022 - 2023)|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|Development and Operation|33.30%|3,000,000 FRAX|-|\n|Security|15.60%|1,400,000 FRAX|1,200,000 FRAX|\n|Grants|6.70%|600,000 FRAX|544,000 FRAX|\n|Reserve Emergency Fund|11.10%|1,000,000 FRAX|-|\n|Legal and Compliance|33.30%|3,000,000 FRAX|-|\n\n\n\n\n### Benchmark:\n\n||Frax Proposed Annual Max Caps|Lido DAO Budget (2022)|Maker DAO Budget (2022)|Aave DAO Budget (2023)|\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|Development and Operation|3,000,000 FRAX|$11,200,000|$24,608,019|$10,120,000|\n|Security|1,400,000 FRAX|$2,500,000|$2,044,300|$3,200,000|\n|Grants|600,000 FRAX|$2,000,000|$1,115,869|$5,300,000|\n|Reserve Emergency Fund|1,000,000 FRAX|$800,000|-|-|\n|Legal and Compliance|3,000,000 FRAX|$620,000|-|-|\n|Total|9,000,000 FRAX|$17,120,000|$27,768,188|$18,620,000|\n\n### Additional Notes\n\n* This proposal represents the maximum caps for each category, not necessarily the exact amounts that will be used.\n* This proposal does not cover the costs of liquidity incentivization. Kindly refer to the [Votium](https://snapshot.org/#/frax.eth/proposal/0x606e06ce600e8f652ee04e2fdfb0ec11b09c78547d0eae3bf5bf8c9c5e214b28) and [WETHR](https://gov.frax.finance/t/fip-182-frxethbp-wethr-program/2097) proposals for budget allocations related to liquidity incentivization.\n* All previously approved budgets are still in effect and considered in our ongoing operations. This proposal is designed to supplement and build upon the existing financial strategies.\n* This proposal does not account for FXS. The team plans to continue utilizing their current treasury allotment of FXS for core development compensation. If more FXS resources become necessary in the future, a specific governance proposal will be initiated.\n\n## Vote\n\n* For: Authorize a maximum annual budget cap of 9M FRAX (2023 - 2024)\n* Against: Do nothing.\n\n### References\n\n[[FIP - 103] Development of Liquidity Risk Profile Dashboard for Frax Finance.

      "content": "### Author\n\nFrax Core Team\n\n## Summary\n\nThis proposal seeks to expand the eligibility criteria for the FXS Gauge within the Frax DAO system. We propose to include pools or vaults with frxETH as their underlying token alongside those already eligible with FRAX.\n\n## Background and motivation\n\nThe FXS Gauge mechanism, designed to incentivize locked liquidity, has until now been primarily limited to pools or vaults deploying FRAX as their underlying asset. Including the frxETH-ETH pair was a notable exception, marking one of the first occasions where a non-FRAX stablecoin pair was whitelisted. This proposal aims to extend the eligibility to other frxETH pairs, in response to the Frax community's feedback and to further enhance the functionality and adaptability of the Frax ecosystem.\n\nAfter careful consideration, we believe that frxETH, just like FRAX, plays a crucial role in our ecosystem and should be equally eligible for gauge incentives. Additionally, veFXS holders can decide where they see the best value, providing a democratic solution to any potential distribution concerns.\n\n## Details\n\nUpon approval of this proposal, pools or vaults with frxETH as their underlying token would be eligible for the FXS Gauge system. We believe this is a step forward in our ecosystem, offering more options and flexibility to our community. The team is fully aware of the potential challenges it may bring, and we commit to closely monitoring the situation and making necessary adjustments when and if they become necessary.\n\n### Vote\n\n* For: Expand Eligibility for FXS Gauge to Include Pools/Vaults with frxETH\n* Against: Do nothing.",

      "content": "Title: Anthias.xyz x Fraxlend Liquidation Health Tooling Grant Proposal\nAuthor(s): 0xBroze + Anthias Team (0xBroze#1326 in Frax Discord)\nSubmission Date: April 30, 2023\n\n![anthias-frax|690x403](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard11/uploads/frax1/original/2X/e/ecd0f40e33ca33533196801635a6df314bf066b0.jpeg)\n\n\n## Proposal Overview\n\n**Simple Summary**\n\nThe Anthias team is proposing a grant to build a Fraxlend-specific liquidation health dashboard for the Fraxlend borrowing and lending market. This analytics dashboard will exist for the Fraxlend community, enabling stakeholders within the Fraxlend borrowing & lending ecosystem to manage liquidation cascade risk and more.\n\n**About Anthias + Abstract**\n\nThe Anthias team is composed of three members of Dartmouth Blockchain. Our philosophy is to continually provide value to the blockchain ecosystem through shipping useful products and research. We have extensive experience in DeFi, having contributed at Yeti Finance, Primitive Finance, Temple DAO, and more. We have shipped multiple grants for [Euler ](https://twitter.com/anthiasxyz/status/1610684073235853312?s=20&t=BYc7dewlCrxy6ZXCzTrYfA) and [Aave](https://twitter.com/anthiasxyz/status/1573459225119948802?s=20&t=BYc7dewlCrxy6ZXCzTrYfA) and have recently been approved for integrations with Compound V2 and V3 as well as Exactly Protocol.\n\nThis liquidation dashboard will improve the Fraxlend stakeholder/token holder experience by allowing users to identify wallets close to liquidation on Fraxlend and position themselves accordingly. The recent crash of May 2022 was caused largely by a series of liquidation cascades as large whale wallets were liquidated. As liquidators sold massive amounts of collateral on exchanges, collateral prices dropped, which resulted in more liquidations. We created Anthias to democratize liquidation health data of all wallets, so all users are able to manage liquidation risk more effectively.\n\n**Previous Work Showcase / Who Supports Anthias?**\n\n* Aave\n\n  * We created our initial dashboard in June of 2022 to monitor liquidation health on Aave after the Terra/Luna collapse.\n  * We completed our first grant for Aave in October of 2022. In this grant, we expanded our initial Aave dashboard to allow users to view historical liquidation health data in order to develop an even clearer picture around market risk.\n* Euler\n  * We completed our first grant for Euler in September of 2022. This grant was to integrate our initial liquidation health dashboard with Euler.\n  * Our second Euler grant was completed in January of 2023. With this grant, we expanded our tool suite for Euler to do Value at Risk monitoring and simulations, in-depth asset and health score filtering, and a more granular wallet view to show covariance among assets individual users were borrowing and supplying.\n* Compound\n  * We were approved for our first integration with Compound V2 and V3 in March of 2023. This grant is to integrate our initial liquidation health dashboard with both Compound V2 and V3.\n* Exactly\n  * We were approved for our first integration with Exactly Protocol in February of 2023. This grant is to integrate our initial liquidation health dashboard with Exactly on both Ethereum and Optimism.\n\n## Motivation\n\nThere are a number of risk vectors in borrowing and lending protocols, including smart contract risk, price oracle manipulation risk, governance / pool management risk, and market risk (liquidations + bad debt). As protocols like Fraxlend continue to onboard more users, it is increasingly important to equip users with necessary risk-management analytics for healthy activity. Safeguarding users against risk ensures the long-term sustainability of the protocol, as well as an improved user experience (competitive differentiation with other borrowing and lending protocols).\n\nProjects like Gauntlet Network and RiskDAO have showcased what is possible with on-chain analytics for DeFi. On a longer term horizon, we hope to expand on previous projects in two ways: historical data and granular daily data. We will store various metrics (some already live at Anthias.xyz), including Aggregate Liquidation Health, Total Collateral Value at Risk, Wallets at Risk, and more. Users will be able to monitor the historical trends of these metrics, while also viewing granular breakdowns of these metrics per day. We see Anthias as a useful public good for various stakeholders within the Fraxlend ecosystem to manage risk: the DAO governors, users (borrowers and lenders), and researchers. The Anthias team prides itself on making risk management tools usable by all stakeholders–we will continue that mission via these tools for the Fraxlend community.\n\n## Specification & Implementation\n\nWe are proposing a grant to fund the development of integrating a Fraxlend dashboard with Anthias.xyz for the Fraxlend borrowing and lending market with the deliverables listed below:\n\n* Live metrics presented: Active Wallets, Wallets at Risk, and Aggregate Liquidation Score\n* Table view presented: Active Wallets (includes address, supply amount, borrow amount, and liquidation health)\n* Graph view presented: Active wallets (includes liquidation health and wallet size visualization)\n* The ability for users to download a CSV of the data presented in the Table View, so that data can be used in modeling\n* Wallet View that displays collateral and debt by asset for individual wallets\n\n**Cost**\n\n* The cost of this integration for our team will be $17k upon completion of the dashboard. This payment will be used for the following costs:\n  * Database storage ($500)\n  * Server hosting ($50)\n  * Nodes ($450)\n  * Contributor compensation ($16,000)\n\nThe deliverables will be live at www.anthias.xyz/Fraxlend. These dashboards will be live for 6 months at which point the community can determine whether it would like to fund the Anthias team on a per-quarter basis to maintain server costs.\n\n**Timeline // How long will development take?**\n\nWe estimate development time to take 6-7 weeks from approval. Based on feedback from community members, we plan to continue iterating and shipping out new and useful features.\n\n**Voting**\n\n* For: I approve the proposal\n* Against: Do nothing",

The Yield Bonding mechanism allows users to deposit yield-earning assets and receive COIL instead of their underlying rewards, which are then deposited into yield-earning strategies in our treasury. COIL absorbs the sell pressure that CRV/CVX/FXS would typically face, as 100% of the yields earned are locked in non-predatory strategies managed by the Spiral DAO team.\n\n### **Motivation:**\n\nSpiral DAO supports Frax stability and deployed a majority of LP paired with FraxBP. \nSpiral DAO decrease overall sell pressure for FXS / CRV / CVX emissions by utilizing them in non-cannibalistic ways. Spiral DAO plans to support FraxSwap pools for yield bonding in the roadmap and looking to increase its exposure towards FXS.\nSpiral DAO plans to participate and buy votes on bribe markets with USDC, thus increasing the overall yield to veFXS voters.\n\nSpiral DAO currently owns about **37.8k locked CRV**, or about 300k USD at current prices; see [Treasury Multisig](https://debank.com/profile/0xC47eC74A753acb09e4679979AfC428cdE0209639) and looking to increase it's exposure.\n\n\n### **Voting:**\n\n- For: Add the COIL/FraxBP pool to the FXS gauge controller\n- Against: Do nothing",

      "content": "#### Governance Notes: \n- This is the third edition of this proposal, and it is approved by the author.   \n- Due to limitation of Snapshot, data section of this proposal is not available here but it can be found in Governance Forum.\n\n### Author\nLyule67.ETH\n\n### Proposal\nThe statement has been made “if you want an unlock, refund all the rewards.”\n\nBelow, you will find math showing proportionate calculations outlining how many rewards the current and proposed-to-be-unlocked-TVL received.\n\nAdditionally, you will find the grand total of all rewards ever given.\n\nThe “Respective Percentage” or “RP” was calculated by comparing the (current) proposed-to-be-unlocked-TVL weight against the TVL of any 1 voting period, since inception of the pool’s gauge.\n\nIf the Frax Gatekeepers feel the proposed amount is unreasonable given the data shown in this iteration of the proposal, then I will leave it up to them to decide what they believe is fair, just please make the proper adjustment in the snapshot version of the vote.\n\nI encourage any interested party to run the numbers themselves to verify I did not error, and to voice their opinion, especially if in opposition.\n\nEDIT#1\nPer the recommendation of Sir Sam Kazemian, I have edited the figures to include the average(AVG.) price of FXS at the time of rewards-emitted for all voting periods to date. The AVG is calculated using 3 data points: First-Voting-Date, Last-Voting-Date/First-APR-date and Last-APR-Date. Using the AVG price of FXS per period, I will then include both the total, and the weight-adjusted # as before.\n\nEDIT#2\nAfter further discussion with Sam K (thank you sir), It was pointed out that I made one grave error in my initial calculations; my original equations did not account for the Time-Lock Boost Multiplier of Emissions per capita. The calculations below now account for this.\n\nSam proposed a 3x across the board on all previous “Liable Debt” calculations, for simplicities sake. I ran into a problem while performing that operation however, in that once we get to more recent figures, the 3x results in an over calculation. To combat this, I decided to use a “Virtual Weight” for the figures, which allowed me to apply the 3x while still retaining the relative weight per pool, per period, to determine the value of rewards owed. The virtual weight calculations account for the 3x boost to APR through TVL rather than directly to APR, the same way the gauges do. This was a much more workable method of achieving the desired outcome of accounting for the 3x boost on locked TVL and how it affected rewards and thereby the Debt Liability in this proposal.\n\nI started with a MAX LOCK(3.0x) and utilized a linear decay (-0.013 every 7 days) for the boost calculations.\n(Additionally, I found a single figure where I incorrectly calculated the average price of FXS for a single period and have since corrected that.)\n\nTotal $value$ upon emission of ALL rewards = $576,460.9796 = 23.2% (fee)\n\nTotal USD of all FXS rewards emitted to 2.484m LP valued at time of emission, using Max Boost of 3.0 with linear decay : $208,481.0176\n\n208,481.0176 / 2,484,000 = 8.39%\n\n#### I propose the 2.484m TVL within the StakeDAO sdETH-FraxPut Pool be unlocked for a withdrawal fee equal to the USD-Value-at-time-of-Emission of ALL FXS rewarded to the (2.484m) LP in this pool (8.39% of 2.484m TVL) (+ slippage ~1.57%) = 10% FEE\n\n# Vote\n- For:  Implement the ragequit function for the StakeDAO sdETH-FraxPut gauge (10% fee)\n- Against: Do nothing.",

We believe this standard is important for DeFi vault composability and security. It substantially lowers the integration effort for other protocols and increases the ability to leverage a variety of community tools for safe development.\n\n**Our goal is to make the vast majority of DeFi in the next year compatible with ERC-4626 and become a first-line resource for developers to build vaults going forward.**\n\nFor more details on the initiative, view our:\n\n* 4626 Alliance Website (https://erc4626.info/) where you can find resources about ERC-4626, a description of the purpose of the Alliance and its supporters, a Bounty Board, a database of live ERC-4626 compliant vaults, and a news section.\n* 4626 Alliance One-pager ([Notion – The all-in-one workspace for your notes, tasks, wikis, and databases.](https://mstable.notion.site/4626-Alliance-one-pager-0139b612869647c39e7d472960b94c3e)) that describes this initiative and proposes a series of actions to move the standard forward\n* Twitter: @erc4626 & public telegram group: erc4626alliance\n\n#### **Why join?**\n\nContributing capital would additionally allow Frax to influence the decision making around the development of other relevant 4626s and integrate across all current and future product lines. This includes development efforts to make Frax’s own contracts conform with the standard for plugging into other DeFi protocols.\n\nWith staked frxETH already being one of the first widely used ERC-4626 implementations, Frax would also be able to contribute to the 4626 Alliance as a Starring Partner for the sponsorship of the creation of the open source resource library, establishment of the common pipeline of “4626 essentials,” and promotion of the 4626 standards through publication and events.\n\n**Estimated size & use of funds:** The Alliance has raised ~$40k in commitments. We are asking for a contribution of $3-5k from Frax to join these efforts. Existing funds are being used to create 4626 resources and built adapters for agreed upon DeFi protocols via bounty programs.\n\n**Contact details:** vikram@superform.xyz, @vikruna on telegram, or the 4626 telegram chat\n\n#### **Vote**\n\n- For: Allocate $4,000 for contributing to 4626 Alliance efforts\n\n- Against: Do nothing",

The token holders are staking through staking contracts built in StaFi protocol, and then get alternative tokens(rToken - such as rETH), rTokens are tradable and it can get staking rewards from the original chain at the same time to achieve the maximum yield\n\n### Motivation:\n\nWith StaFi rETH already valued at $33m staked , we believe that rETH/frxETH would be a great addition and would contribute greatly to the ideals that frax want to achieve with its WETHR program. This signifies our support to the program that would focus on committing positive liquidity along with other LSD’s.\n\n### Voting:\n\n- For: Add the rETH/frxETH pool to the FXS gauge controller\n- Against: Do nothing",

As a leader in the global hacker movement, Dora provides crypto-native toolkits to help developers around the world raise funding and build. To date, 30+ major blockchain ecosystems have already adopted Dora's infrastructure (hackerlink.io / dorafactory.org) for quadratic funding, community contribution, hackathon, bounty distribution, and governance of their developer communities. By far, 2200 projects in the DoraHacks community have received over $20 million in grants and contributions from supporters worldwide.\n\nIn over two years since launch, Frax has been able to establish themselves as one of the protocols teams in all of DeFi. Although the core team only counts in the single digits, they have been able to propagate an ecosystem of stablecoins and subprotocols. The question remains though, if we want Frax to reach the heights comparable to Ethereum and beyond, how can we cultivate a community to build on it?\n\nFraxbuild is the first official hackathon endorsed by Frax Finance. The event will be online and hackers will have 50 days to submit their applications. The goal of this hackathon is to increase dev awareness of building on Frax, promote the creation of products and primitives that complement the Frax ecosystem of stablecoins and primitives, as well as educate developers about how they can integrate Frax into their protocols.\n\nUtilizing its platform, Flywheel DeFi will help organize and spread awareness about the event via\n\n* Acting as the liaison between Dorahacks and the Frax Core Team\n* Promoting the hackathon on our social media platforms\n  * Placements in Flywheel content such as Flywheel, Frax Check, and Frax in Review throughout the duration of the event\n  * Announcements on Social Media\n* Organizing the hackathon itself and supporting hackers and judges when possible\n\n## Proposal Details\n\nWe propose $57.5k of FXS to be allocated towards Fraxbuild to be allocated as follows:\n\n* $50k towards prizes\n* $7.5k towards Flywheel for helping organize, and promote the event\n\n## PROPOSAL\n\n- For: Authorize $57.5k of FXS towards Fraxbuild\n\n- Against: Do nothing",

      "content": "## Summary\n\nThis is a proposal to onboard and activate an AMO that lends FRAX to Flux Finance. We propose a Max Allocation Cap for the AMO of 2MM FRAX to get the community comfortable with the workflows. Flux Finance is a decentralized lending protocol developed by Ondo Finance that enables over-collateralized lending and borrowing in a peer-to-pool model. The protocol is a fork of Compound V2 with minor modifications related to permissioning that have been audited through code4rena. Loans on Flux are overcollateralized by the Ondo Short-Term US Government Bond Fund (OUSG), a class of limited partnership interests in Ondo I LP, a Delaware limited partnership. OUSG is backed by investments in the Blackrock iShares Short Treasury Bond ETF (SHV) and uses third-party regulated service providers for custody, fund administration, and auditing. This proposal begins by providing an overview of Ondo entities and the structure of OUSG before turning to Flux and its FRAX Lending Pool.\n\n#### FRAX Governance Note:  Due to character limitation of Snapshot, details about this proposal are not posted here but they can be found in the Frax Gov Forum : https://gov.frax.finance/t/fip-216-activate-amo-that-lends-frax-to-flux-finance/2259#contents-2 \n\n## Voting\n\n- For: Authorize up to $2M FRAX for the FLUX AMO.\n- Against: Do nothing.",

The Zunami Protocol integrates directly with Curve/StakeDAO/Convex smart contracts by providing liquidity in pools. Zunami utilizes an Omni pool to rebalance and diversify user funds. The current set of strategies is approved by DAO vote and consists of XAI/FRAXBP, ALUSD/FRAXBP, and MIM/3CRV.\nUZD is a stablecoin with a rebase mechanism that is collateralized by LP tokens of Zunami and backed by stablecoins held in Curve pools. UZD is also a pool-aware token that stops rebasing when it is inside a pool, while the rebase continues outside the pool. Furthermore, CRV, CVX, and FXS, which were initially intended for rebase, are now either locked or used for bribing.\n\n### Motivation:\nZunami supports the FRAX ecosystem, with over 50% of the protocol's funds allocated to FRAXBP pools. Recently, FRAX was also added as one of the main stablecoins for deposits and withdrawals, alongside USDT, USDC, and DAI. Additionally, the team plans to launch an ETH omni pool with frxETH as one of the main assets.\n\n### Voting:\n\n- For: Add the UZD/FraxBP pool to the FXS gauge controller\n\n- Against: Do nothing.",

      "title": "[FIP - 214] Unlock the StakeDAO sdETH-FraxPut Gauge",
      "content": "### **Summary**\n\nUnlock the StakeDAO sdETH-FraxPut Gauge\n\n### **Background & Motivation**\n\nIn a recent statement, StakeDAO announced that they are deprecating their options products:\n\nhttps://twitter.com/StakeDAOHQ/status/1635705988865982467\n\nThis closure is of relevance as one product, the ETH Put Selling Strategy, occupies a Frax gauge (sdETH-FraxPut) and has associated locked liquidity. StakeDAO users are currently being advised to withdraw from their options position. As such, this author believes the Frax community should vote to unlock the gauge.\n\nThe ETH Put Selling Strategy (the Strategy) is described on the StakeDAO website:\n\n*This strategy leverages Opyn’s oTokens to sell 7-day European ETH put options every Friday to market makers via Airswap. The premium received generates passive income for its users. The position is covered with USD stable coin collateral representing 100% of the face value of the put options sold. The USD stable coin collateral is staked into Stake DAO’s Passive FRAX Strategy to generate additional yield.*\n\nFrom the Frax perspective, having the position collateralized with FRAX3CRV pool tokens helps with the $FRAX peg. Some community members believe this is sufficient reason alone to reject unlocking (for example, see Dennett: https://gov.frax.finance/t/3crv-4pool-unlock-lps-in-the-sdeth-fraxput-and-sdfrax3crv-f-gauge-pools/1348/5), and I understand this perspective. Indeed, recent market conditions have illustrated the importance of maintaining a strong $FRAX peg. However, the fact remains that the strategy was designed, first and foremost, to sell ETH puts. Lockers had a reasonable expectation that ETH puts would continue to be sold while the gauge persists – this is no longer the case.\n\n### In terms of numbers:\n\n* Current gauge weight: 0.28% (~123 FXS per week)\n* Current value locked: 2.5 million USD\n\nFinally, just a broad comment: The partnership between Frax and StakeDAO has been one of the more enjoyable to witness. It has been a pleasure to see how these two teams and communities have supported each other thus far, with supporting products on each platform and many dual community members. Perhaps optimistically, I hope that Frax members will extend this support once more to StakeDAO by unlocking the sdETH-FraxPut gauge, though I am sure the good vibes will continue regardless of the outcome.\n\n### Voting\n- For : Unlock the StakeDAO sdETH-FraxPut Gauge\n- Against : Do nothing ",

There is still much to be done in terms of educating the wider DeFi ecosystem and beyond about Frax, and proliferating quality content is a good starting point.\n\n## Proposal Details\n\nWe propose a maximum allocation of $30k for three months (max $10k per month) in educational/marketing content about the Frax ecosystem. Flywheel will receive a fee of 12.5% of the grants distributed in FXS for administering the program.\n\n* Categories of content include written, video, or infographic.\n\n* Suggestions of content include FRAX, frxETH, FRAXBP, FPI, Frax Primitives (Fraxlend, Fraxswap, Fraxferry), etc.\n\n* Submissions of content are to be managed by the Flywheel team based on quality and relevance to the Frax ecosystem.\n\n* Frax core team will have final approval of which content is rewarded or rejected.\n\n* Incentives will be paid in FXS\n\n* Incentives will be paid at the end of each month in a first-come, first-served manner. If the monthly paid incentives reached the cap, the rest of the queue would be considered for the next month.\n\n|Category|Platform|Indicator|Reward|\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|Written|Miscellaneous|Publish an article directed at a beginner audience|$250|\n|Written|Miscellaneous|Publish an article directed at an intermediate/advanced audience|$250|\n|Video|YouTube|Reach 1,000 views on a video|$250|\n|Video|YouTube|Reach 10,000 views on a video|$500|\n|Infographic|Twitter|Reach 10,000 views on a single infographic|$250|\n|Infographic|Twitter|Reach 50,000 views on a single infographic|$500|\n|Thread|Twitter|Reach 10,000 views on a single thread of at least 8 tweets|$250|\n|Thread|Twitter|Reach 50,000 views on a single thread of at least 8 tweets|$500|\n|Dashboard|Dune Analytics|Build a dashboard  with least 4 query visualizations that has information that is not available on Frax Facts and other dashboards.|$500-$1500|\n\n## Proposal\n\n* For: Authorization of Frax Ecosystem Educational Incentives\n\n* Against: Do Nothing",

      "title": "[FIP - 206] Enabling Bunni-LP frxETH/WETH Gauges on Frax Finance Staking",
      "content": "## Introduction\n\nTimeless Finance's protocol,[ bunni.pro](http://bunni.pro/), is pleased to submit this proposal to enable the Bunni-LP frxETH/WETH gauges in order to receive FXS rewards.\n\n## Background\n\nBunni is a protocol that was initially released in October 2022 built on top of Uniswap V3, which leverages its deep liquidity to offer a more capital-efficient trading experience for users. Bunni has a public utility that represents Uniswap v3 liquidity positions as fungible ERC-20 tokens instead of NFTs. This allows for more complex incentivization schemes to be created for Uniswap v3 liquidity. Since its initial release, Timeless has continued to improve and develop Bunni, turning it into a full-fledged liquidity engine, with improvements to its tokenomics inspired by protocols such as Balancer and Curve. Our platform has already facilitated over $194,248,029 in total volume with the FRAX/USDC pool and has over $4.5 million in TVL between the two pools in just three months.\n\n## Proposal\n\nWe propose that Frax Finance add a gauge for Bunni to further grow our relationship. Doing this should help with providing efficient deep liquidity while also adding to the flywheel effect created from TRC #010 https://gov.timelessfi.com/discussion/10204-trc10-direct-all-bunni-protocol-fees-towards-vote-incentives-on-bribe-markets. Our venomic-based gauges will offer incentives and free bribes coming from swap fees to LPs who participate in our liquidity optimization services. We believe that working together, we can create an even more robust ecosystem for Frax Finance LPs and holders.\n\n### Evaluation of Success\n\nWe will measure the success of our Frax Finance gauge by monitoring the liquidity and trading volume of frxETH/WETH liquidity pool along with bribe market stats and % of total veLIT votes the pool receive.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBunni is excited to grow our relationship with Frax Finance by creating a more efficient and effective ecosystem for traders and LPs. Our liquidity optimization services and incentives will encourage LPs to use our platform and deepen liquidity. We look forward to partnering with Frax Finance and contributing to a better trading experience for everyone involved.\n\n### References/Useful links\n\nBunni Webapp:[ https://bunni.pro/](https://bunni.pro/)\n\nTimeless Webapp:[ https://timelessfi.com/](https://timelessfi.com/)\n\nDocs:[ https://docs.timelessfi.com/](https://docs.timelessfi.com/)\n\nBlog:[ https://blog.timelessfi.com/](https://blog.timelessfi.com/)\n\nBunni Dune analytics:[ https://dune.com/bored_genius/bunni](https://dune.com/bored_genius/bunni)\n\nTwitter:[ https://twitter.com/timeless_fi](https://twitter.com/timeless_fi)\n\nForum:[ https://gov.timelessfi.com/](https://gov.timelessfi.com/)\n\nGithub: Bunni ·[ https://github.com/ZeframLou/bunni](https://github.com/ZeframLou/bunni)\n\nDefiLlama:[ https://defillama.com/protocol/timeless](https://defillama.com/protocol/timeless)\n\nBunni frxETH/WETH pool address: 0xefFe49D9fCe8A4fC71Be42f7b2A83Bd353107Be3\n\nBunni frxETH/WETH gauge address: 0x4Bf0082080d937897330BAB735c2Baa99FF16F19\n\n## Voting\n- For: Add Bunni-LP frxETH/WETH to the FXS gauge controller\n- Against: Do nothing.",

      "title": "[FIP - 205] Enabling Bunni-LP FRAX/USDC Gauge on Frax Finance Staking",
      "content": "## Introduction\n\nTimeless Finance's protocol,[ bunni.pro](http://bunni.pro/), is pleased to submit this proposal to enable the Bunni-LP FRAX/USDC gauge in order to receive FXS rewards.\n\n## Background\n\nBunni is a protocol that was initially released in October 2022 built on top of Uniswap V3, which leverages its deep liquidity to offer a more capital-efficient trading experience for users. Bunni has a public utility that represents Uniswap v3 liquidity positions as fungible ERC-20 tokens instead of NFTs. This allows for more complex incentivization schemes to be created for Uniswap v3 liquidity. Since its initial release, Timeless has continued to improve and develop Bunni, turning it into a full-fledged liquidity engine, with improvements to its tokenomics inspired by protocols such as Balancer and Curve. Our platform has already facilitated over $194,248,029 in total volume with the FRAX/USDC pool and has over $4.5 million in TVL between the two pools in just three months.\n\n## Proposal\n\nWe propose that Frax Finance add a gauge for Bunni to further grow our relationship. Doing this should help with providing efficient deep liquidity while also adding to the flywheel effect created from TRC #010 https://gov.timelessfi.com/discussion/10204-trc10-direct-all-bunni-protocol-fees-towards-vote-incentives-on-bribe-markets. Our venomic-based gauges will offer incentives and free bribes coming from swap fees to LPs who participate in our liquidity optimization services. We believe that working together, we can create an even more robust ecosystem for Frax Finance LPs and holders.\n\n### Evaluation of Success\n\nWe will measure the success of our Frax Finance gauges by monitoring the liquidity and trading volume of the FRAX/USDC liquidity pools along with bribe market stats and % of total veLIT votes the pools receive.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nBunni is excited to grow our relationship with Frax Finance by creating a more efficient and effective ecosystem for traders and LPs. Our liquidity optimization services and incentives will encourage LPs to use our platform and deepen liquidity. We look forward to partnering with Frax Finance and contributing to a better trading experience for everyone involved.\n\n### References/Useful links\n\nBunni Webapp:[ https://bunni.pro/](https://bunni.pro/)\n\nTimeless Webapp:[ https://timelessfi.com/](https://timelessfi.com/)\n\nDocs:[ https://docs.timelessfi.com/](https://docs.timelessfi.com/)\n\nBlog:[ https://blog.timelessfi.com/](https://blog.timelessfi.com/)\n\nBunni Dune analytics:[ https://dune.com/bored_genius/bunni](https://dune.com/bored_genius/bunni)\n\nTwitter:[ https://twitter.com/timeless_fi](https://twitter.com/timeless_fi)\n\nForum:[ https://gov.timelessfi.com/](https://gov.timelessfi.com/)\n\nGithub: Bunni ·[ https://github.com/ZeframLou/bunni](https://github.com/ZeframLou/bunni)\n\nDefiLlama:[ https://defillama.com/protocol/timeless](https://defillama.com/protocol/timeless)\n\nBunni FRAX/USDC pool address: 0x088DCFE115715030d441a544206CD970145F3941\n\nBunni FRAX/USDC gauge address: 0x471A34823DDd9506fe8dFD6BC5c2890e4114Fafe\n\n### Vote\n- For:  Add Bunni-LP FRAX/USDC to FXS gauge controller\n- Against: Do nothing",

      "title": "[FIP - 199] REVISED: Metronome <> Frax: Partnership and Incentives Strategy",
      "content": "## Authors\n\nZane Huffman (Metronome, Vesper Finance)\n\nJordan Kruger (Metronome, Vesper Finance)\n\n## Summary\n\nDeploy a new factory pool to Curve: msETH-frxETH. Integrate pool into Convex and Frax Gauges with the help of Frax team.\n\nMatch CVX voting power towards the msETH-frxETH; msUSD-FraxBP pools.\n\nMetronome and Vesper Finance to fully support frxETH and Frax through the full product suite.\n\nAssess success over time and potentially extend this relationship to include further incentives per user demand, and extend support to FPI and FXS.\n\n## Revisions\n\nThis proposal is a revision of a previous proposal. The following changes were made:\n\n* CVX match reduced to 110,000 and broken down between msUSD-fraxBP and msETH-frxETH.\n* sfrxETH collateral has already been deployed to Metronome.\n\n## Background and Motivation\n\nMetronome is a multi-collateral, multi-synthetic platform that emphasizes productive collateral. Metronome is supported by the same Bloq team as sister project Vesper - a DeFi yield aggregator with several existing integrations unique to FRAX (Convex, Saddle).\n\nMetronome intends to support productive assets, through Vesper or other yield platforms, as collateral to mint synthetic versions of popular assets. Users can swap those assets for a looping yield farming experience, trade those assets, take directional positions, and so on.\n\nSpecifically with regards to frxETH and LSD as a whole, Vesper + Metronome offers a uniquely powerful looping experience. Vesper enables a “yield-plus” experience (earn ETH staking APY plus DeFi strategy APY). Metronome offers fixed interest rates for minting synthetics, including an “msETH” synthetic. This combo enables the most capital efficient yield farming experience on LSD in the market today.\n\nThis mechanism extends towards FRAX (support already exists for FRAX on Vesper + vaFRAX on Metronome).\n\nIn return for deployment of this product suite and prioritization of Frax ecosystem assets, we seek to extend a formalized partnership around the projects, cemented through an incentives matching budget to deepen liquidity to the benefit of both communities.\n\n### Section 0: Pool Deployment\n\nFrax team will aid Metronome to ensure that the prospective msETH-frxETH pool can be deployed properly across the full CRV/CVX/FXS gauge system, including proposal authorship and utilization of voting weight.\n\n### Section 1: Incentive Matching Budget\n\nFrax team will match 110,000 CVX voting power towards this pool 1:1 with Metronome treasury voting through four voting cycles (~2 months). Metronome treasury currently holds [roughly 165,000 CVX](https://etherscan.io/token/0x4e3fbd56cd56c3e72c1403e103b45db9da5b9d2b?a=0xd1de3f9cd4ae2f23da941a67ca4c739f8dd9af33).\n\nWe intend to split the composite 220,000 CVX (110,000 matched 1:1) as follows:\n\n* msUSD-FraxBP: 150,000 CVX\n* msETH-frxETH: 70,000 CVX\n\nThis matching program will commence on the first voting cycle that sees msETH-frxETH properly integrated into Curve/Convex/Frax gauges.\n\n### Section 2: Frax integration throughout Metronome, Vesper\n\nCurrently, FRAX is supported on Vesper and both naked FRAX and vaFRAX are supported in Metronome. As of recently, sfrxETH is also integrated as collateral onto Metronome.\n\nVesper will additionally expand to support yield strategies on top of frxETH. This may include:\n\n* Curve-Convex frxETH-ETH LP\n* FraxLend sfrxETH-borrow-FRAX\n* Aave v3 sfrxETH-borrow-Stablecoins\n* Future strategies as they become available\n\nThe Vesper pool will be intended as sfrxETH APY-plus, giving users a higher APY exposure to frxETH. This pool will additionally be added to Metronome as collateral.\n\n### Section 3: Program Extension\n\nThe above agreements are intended to establish the Metronome + Vesper product suite within the Frax ecosystem for holders of both FRAX and FXS.\n\nIn particular, this system is intended to provide increased demand for frxETH and extension of supply by giving users a powerful strategy to take on a looping position for multiplied frxETH APY.\n\nShould there be significant market demand for these products, this proposal may be extended after the 4-cycle agreement with a follow up proposal to continue CVX matching and/or introduce a bribe matching program.\n\nIn addition to FRAX and frxETH, Vesper can extend deployment to FXS and FPI pools, with the same intent purpose of inclusion in Metronome.\n\nIn the event of any multi-chain ambitions in the future, Vesper + Metronome can also be incorporated on those chains.\n\nLastly, both teams can discuss privileged opportunities for Frax assets, like a separate synthetics pool with better rates. This would require future governance activity through Metronome DAO.\n\n### Summary\n\nPrioritize frxETH and FRAX throughout the Vesper + Metronome ecosystem, giving the users the opportunity to deposit and passively earn yield through Vesper and simultaneously post that productive position as collateral to Metronome.\n\nFrax to match 110,000 CVX voting weight with Metronome for four voting cycles.\n\nFrax ecosystem participants benefit in a number of ways:\n\n* New yield farming opportunities on frxETH + FRAX\n* Increased demand and potential supply expansion on frxETH, driving greater revenue back to Frax and veFXS holders.\n* Ability to take on directional, exotic positions on Frax ecosystem assets using a combination of Frax Finance collateral against misc. synthetic positions.\n* Routing of Frax assets throughout the broader DeFi ecosystem, driving relevant metrics like liquidity, borrow activity, trading volume, and so on\n\n## Voting\n\nFor: Authorize a CVX voting match of 110,000 CVX for four voting cycles.\n\nAgainst: Do nothing.",

This function will provide community members with greater flexibility and freedom in managing their capital while ensuring that the underlying protocol is not exposed to significant risk. The proposal also aims to generate profits for the protocol if passed.\n\nThe current FRAX/mUSD liquidity pool has seen minimal adoption with FRAX transaction volume since its inception, making it an ineffective and non-productive way to direct capital towards. The proposed solution is a ragequit function that will allow community members to exit their positions in the FRAX/mUSD liquidity pool with a 20% fee.\n\n### Additional Information\n\nIt is important to note that the mStable project is facing challenges such as difficulty in raising capital, limited funds, and market strategy issues. Moreover, the project has stopped directing any MTA rewards to the FRAX/mUSD liquidity pool.\n\n### Vote\n\n• For: Implement the ragequit function for the FRAX/mUSD gauge with a 20% fee.\n• Against: Do Nothing",

      "content": "### Author\n\nNader Ghazvini\n\n## Summary\n\nThis proposal aims to move the maximum lock time for all new gauges back to three years for a 3x boost on the Frax Finance protocol.\n\n## Background and Motivations\n\nCurrently, Frax Finance offers users the option to lock their tokens for one year in exchange for a 2x boost. However, this option has not proven more effective than the previous option of locking tokens for three years for a 3x boost. Therefore, we propose to move the lock option back to three years for a 3x boost. This change will only apply to FRAXOHM, clevUSD, msUSD, and future gauges, and the gauges deployed with a maximum one-year lock and 2x boost won’t be unlocked or redeployed.\n\nBy moving the lock option back to three years, we hope to achieve the following goals:\n\n* Encourage users to lock their tokens for a longer period, resulting in increased liquidity, trading volumes, protocol stability, and anti-reflexivity in the stablecoin peg.\n* Provide users with a more attractive incentive to lock their tokens, improving the platform's overall performance.\n* Increase user participation and engagement on the platform by giving them more flexibility and control over their tokens.\n\n### Vote\n\n* For: Move the maximum lock time for all new gauges back to three years for a 3x boost on the Frax Finance protocol.\n* Against: Do nothing",

We intend for this to be the canonical liquidity venue for USV as we grow our exposure to the Curve ecosystem. Success will directly grow volume and TVL to the FraxBP pool.\n\nUSV or USDC Savings Vault is a USDC bond ETF built using Notional's fixed rate lending market. It provides the holder with yield on their USDC via the investment into the underlying bonds the vault holds.\n\nUSV is currently yielding over 3.5% without leverage, yield paid in kind and all underlying bonds overcollateralised. We are excited to pairs this with the FraxBP programme to help contribute to the FRAX stablecoin usage and grow the fraxbp tvl. We also believe that a low risk yield bearing bond etf offers something different to the vast number of copy cat stable coin assets on Curve. This amplifies the attractiveness of the offering with native yield + additional yield driven by CRV. \n\nWe look forward to working collaboratively. \n\n## Proposal\n- For: Add the USV-FRAXBP Gauge\n- Against: Do nothing",

      "content": "\n### Authors\n\nZane Huffman (Metronome, Vesper Finance)\n\nJordan Kruger (Metronome, Vesper Finance)\n\n## Summary\n\nDeploy a new factory pool to Curve: msETH-frxETH. Integrate pool into Convex and Frax Gauges with the help of Frax team.\n\nMatch CVX voting power towards the msETH-frxETH; msUSD-FraxBP pools.\n\nMetronome and Vesper Finance to fully support frxETH and Frax through the full product suite.\n\nAssess success over time and potentially extend this relationship to include further incentives per user demand, and extend support to FPI and FXS.\n\n## Background and Motivation\n\n[Metronome](https://metronome.io) is a multi-collateral, multi-synthetic platform that emphasizes productive collateral. Metronome is supported by the same Bloq team as sister project [Vesper](https://vesper.finance) - a DeFi yield aggregator with several existing integrations unique to FRAX (Convex, Saddle).\n\nMetronome intends to support productive assets, through Vesper or other yield platforms, as collateral to mint synthetic versions of popular assets. Users can swap those assets for a looping yield farming experience, trade those assets, take directional positions, and so on.\n\nSpecifically with regards to frxETH and LSD as a whole, Vesper + Metronome offers a uniquely powerful looping experience. Vesper enables a “yield-plus” experience (earn ETH staking APY plus DeFi strategy APY). Metronome offers fixed interest rates for minting synthetics, including an “msETH” synthetic. This combo enables the most capital efficient yield farming experience on LSD in the market today.\n\nThis mechanism extends towards FRAX (support already exists for FRAX on Vesper + vaFRAX on Metronome).\n\nIn return for deployment of this product suite and prioritization of Frax ecosystem assets, we seek to extend a formalized partnership around the projects, cemented through an incentives matching budget to deepen liquidity to the benefit of both communities.\n\n### Section 0: Pool Deployment\n\nFrax team will aid Metronome to ensure that the prospective msETH-frxETH pool can be deployed properly across the full CRV/CVX/FXS gauge system, including proposal authorship and utilization of voting weight.\n\n### Section 1: Incentive Matching Budget\n\nFrax team will match any CVX voting power towards this pool 1:1 with Metronome treasury voting through four voting cycles (~2 months) up to 165,000 CVX. Metronome treasury currently holds [roughly 165,000 CVX](https://etherscan.io/token/0x4e3fbd56cd56c3e72c1403e103b45db9da5b9d2b?a=0xd1de3f9cd4ae2f23da941a67ca4c739f8dd9af33).\n\nThese rewards may be split between msUSD-FraxBP and msETH-frxETH at the discretion of both teams, but intention will be to maintain a generalized 1:1 CVX match across that timespan.\n\nThis matching program will commence on the first voting cycle that sees msETH-frxETH properly integrated into Curve/Convex/Frax gauges.\n\n### Section 2: Frax integration throughout Metronome, Vesper\n\nCurrently, FRAX is supported on Vesper and both naked FRAX and vaFRAX are supported in Metronome.\n\nMetronome will initially expand to support sfrxETH, enabling users to loop their position against msETH mintage (or msUSD) to multiply their APY.\n\nVesper will additionally expand to support yield strategies on top of frxETH. This may include:\n\n* Curve-Convex frxETH-ETH LP\n* FraxLend sfrxETH-borrow-FRAX\n* Future strategies as they become available\n\nThe Vesper pool will be intended as sfrxETH APY-plus, giving users a higher APY exposure to frxETH. This pool will additionally be added to Metronome as collateral.\n\n### Section 3: Program Extension\n\nThe above agreements are intended to establish the Metronome + Vesper product suite within the Frax ecosystem for holders of both FRAX and FXS.\n\nIn particular, this system is intended to provide increased demand for frxETH and extension of supply by giving users a powerful strategy to take on a looping position for multiplied frxETH APY.\n\nShould there be significant market demand for these products, this proposal may be extended after the 4-cycle agreement with a follow up proposal to continue CVX matching and/or introduce a bribe matching program.\n\nIn addition to FRAX and frxETH, Vesper can extend deployment to FXS and FPI pools, with the same intent purpose of inclusion in Metronome.\n\nIn the event of any multi-chain ambitions in the future, Vesper + Metronome can also be incorporated on those chains.\n\nLastly, both teams can discuss privileged opportunities for Frax assets, like a separate synthetics pool with better rates. This would require future governance activity through Metronome DAO.\n\n### Summary\n\nPrioritize frxETH and FRAX throughout the Vesper + Metronome ecosystem, giving the users the opportunity to deposit and passively earn yield through Vesper and simultaneously post that productive position as collateral to Metronome.\n\nFrax to match CVX voting weight with Metronome, up-to Metronome’s 165,000 CVX stake, for four voting cycles.\n\nFrax ecosystem participants benefit in a number of ways:\n\n* New yield farming opportunities on frxETH + FRAX\n* Increased demand and potential supply expansion on frxETH, driving greater revenue back to Frax and veFXS holders.\n* Ability to take on directional, exotic positions on Frax ecosystem assets using a combination of Frax Finance collateral against misc. synthetic positions.\n* Routing of Frax assets throughout the broader DeFi ecosystem, driving relevant metrics like liquidity, borrow activity, trading volume, and so on\n\n## Voting\n\n- For: Authorize a CVX voting match of up-to 165,000 CVX for four voting cycles.\n\n- Against: Do nothing.",

      "title": "[FIP - 188] Increase CR to 100%",
      "content": "### Author\nHameed\n\n## Proposal Summary\nSet the target collateral ratio (CR) of the Frax protocol to 100%.  The increase in the CR will be achieved over time through protocol growth and earnings.  **This proposal does not include minting any FXS to increase the CR.**\n\n## Abstract\nThe time has come for Frax to gradually remove the algorithmic backing of the protocol.  The Frax protocol has grown and evolved dramatically since the protocol launched in December 2020.  The original protocol included a variable collateral ratio which adjusted based on the market demand of FRAX, effectively letting the market dictate how much collateral was necessary for each FRAX to equal $1.00.  This was a highly innovative, elegant approach that Frax pioneered but has now outgrown.  The costs of being slightly undercollateralized now far outweigh the benefits – especially because it can undermine the perceived safety of FRAX.  Gradually shifting the protocol to 100% CR is the best path forward for the long-term health and growth of the protocol.\n\nThis is a significant change to the protocol that over time effectively retires the algorithmic backing of Frax.  It has become clear to many active in the community that this is the best path forward.  The intention of this proposal is to coordinate the community on increasing the CR to 100% permanently.  It is more focused on the destination (100% CR) than how we get there - there is no imminent need to increase the CR and there are many ways of reaching the target CR.  Ideally growth, asset appreciation and protocol earnings will increase the CR to 100% over time.  To be clear, this proposal does not rely on minting any FXS to achieve the 100% CR.\n\n## Background and Motivation\nFrax has always approached the algorithmic backing of FRAX conservatively.  Even before launch, it was clear that relying on FXS to back the algorithmic portion of FRAX required locked liquidity to ensure smooth functioning of the protocol.  Unfortunately, we have now seen many projects that didn’t understand this and failed.  The downside of locked liquidity is that the protocol pays for it in the form of FXS rewards.  \n\nWhile this approach made sense to start, the circumstances around Frax have changed.  Frax achieved 0 to 1 product market fit and now has a supply exceeding 1,000,000,000 FRAX.  The next phase of growth requires increasing the “money” attributes of FRAX, specifically making FRAX an asset that users are comfortable holding, without any incentive, as a long-term store of value.  The small algorithmic backing of FRAX creates the perception that FRAX is the less safe option for users to hold, especially after UST’s failure tainted the algorithmic stablecoin concept (whether fairly or unfairly).  There is very little benefit in maintaining the current CR of 92%.\n\n@dennett has made the point that FRAX can be fully collateralized by non-FXS assets and still be fractional reserve by deploying protocol owned liquidity via AMOs.  Increasing protocol collateral also means that additional collateral can be deployed via AMOs to create liquidity and revenue for the protocol.  Frax will continue to be the most capital efficient safe stablecoin while removing the need to constantly fund locked liquidity.  At this point, all protocol expansions occur via AMO and effectively are at 100% CR.  This means that protocol growth increases the CR.\n\nThe gentlest way to increase the CR is to retain protocol earnings as the protocol grows.  As part of this proposal, FXS buybacks will be deferred until the CR reaches 100%.  This is effectively an investment in the future of Frax that will increase protocol assets and remove the need for FXS emissions towards locked liquidity.  There appears to be little impact from FXS buybacks lately and the impact is probably overestimated at this point.  This proposal does not impact the current veFXS yield.  From the perspective of FXS holders, this proposal should increase the soundness / perception of Frax and accelerate protocol growth.  \n\nFinally, this proposal would authorize protocol comptrollers to strategically exchange up to $3m of protocol assets for frxETH each month.  frxETH is becoming an important decentralized asset on Frax’s balance sheet, both increasing the CR while also increasing the supply of frxETH and validators.  frxETH also offers a strong return potential for the protocol.  Up to $3m per month is a small amount given the size of Frax’s protocol assets – it also limits the protocol’s exposure to frxETH price volatility by keeping the value relatively small.  The selling of protocol assets authorized by this proposal is not intended to decrease Frax’s holdings of CVX or CRV and will not include either asset.\n\n\n## Proposal\n\nThis proposal approves the following changes:\n\nI.\tIncrease the target collateral ratio to 100%.  This is the long-term target of the protocol and will require time to reach.  No FXS will be minted to achieve this target.  As part of this change, the protocol is retiring the algorithmic backing of FRAX and the decollateralize function.\n\nII.\tRetain protocol revenue to fund the increased CR, including pausing FXS buybacks.  veFXS yield remains the same.\n\nIII.\tAuthorize up to $3m per month in frxETH purchases to increase the CR.\n_________\n- **For** - Approve the changes described above, including setting the long term target CR of Frax to 100%\n\n- **Against** - Do nothing\n_________________________________________",

      "content": "### Author \nWhiteWidow\n\n## Proposal\nI propose the implementation of a ragequit function for the FRAX/mUSD liquidity pool to address the needs of community members who wish to re-allocate their capital. This function will provide community members with greater flexibility and freedom in managing their capital while ensuring that the underlying protocol is not exposed to significant risk. The proposal also aims to generate profits for the protocol if passed.\n\nThe current FRAX/mUSD liquidity pool has seen minimal adoption with FRAX transaction volume since its inception, making it an ineffective and non-productive way to direct capital towards. The proposed solution is a ragequit function that will allow community members to exit their positions in the FRAX/mUSD liquidity pool with a daily slash rate calculated at 8% per year.\n\n## Additional Information\n\nIt is important to note that the mStable project is facing challenges such as difficulty in raising capital, limited funds, and market strategy issues. Moreover, the project has stopped directing any MTA rewards to the FRAX/mUSD liquidity pool.\n\n## Vote\n\n- For: Implement the ragequit function for the FRAX/mUSD gauge with a daily slash rate calculated based on 8% yearly.\n- Against: Do nothing.",

      "content": "## **Summary**:\nThis proposal is a request to add Sentiment’s FRAX Lending Pool (LFRAX) to FXS gauge controller\n\n## **Background**:\nSentiment is an undercollateralized credit protocol on Arbitrum, allowing borrowers to access up to 5x capital on their collateral value. (Put up whitelisted collateral -> borrow assets from lending pools, up to 5x collateral value)\n\n![Arch chart.jpg](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard11/uploads/frax1/original/2X/d/d7eee86cf673af8fb790030651a948b229b7794c.jpeg)\n\nBorrowers are “confined” within a Sentiment “account”, but users have the ability to deploy borrowed capital within Sentiment-whitelisted yield strategies — such as a variety of Convex & Balancer LP tokens (FRAX/USDC for example), lending on Aave, wstETH, etc. (thus cannot run away with debt & account simply fully liquidated when health factor < 1.2 ((debt + collateral value)/debt owed). An example of a strategy users can deploy using Sentiment is:\n\n1. Deposit 100 $FRAX as collateral \n2. Borrow 500 $FRAX as debt\n3. Deploy into FRAX/USDC  Curve Pool\n4. Earn 5x rewards APY from Curve pool and Gauge\n\n## **Motivation**:\n\nWhile using Sentiment for various strategies has worked in an extremely robust fashion (over $8mm in volume since inception, with the majority coming from stablecoin borrowing → depositing in Convex stable LPs), it’s definitely been tougher to attract lenders due to inherent risk/yield misalignment at the moment, especially given lenders on Sentiment currently cannot borrow against their lent assets, and Sentiment currently does not have a protocol token, thus no direct liquidity mining. As such, we’re pursuing a veFXS gauge for our FRAX lending market (LFRAX) in order to bolster more liquidity (already have an OTC bribe set up). Having a Frax gauge can allow us to incentivize more liquidity, which would create more available FRAX to borrow at a lower interest rate than other stables on our platform. Borrowers will then be able to deposit FRAX in FRAXBP and other FRAX-native yield strategies we hope to integrate in the future. This could create net deeper FRAX liquidity on Arbitrum!\n\n## **Proposal**\n\nWe would live for Sentiment to have a veFXS gauge for our FRAX lending pool. We believe with Sentiment’s user demand for borrowing capital and attractive FRAX yield strategies that exist on Arbitrum a Frax gauge could increase FRAX liquidity and distribution on Arbitrum, while increasing Lending liquidity on Sentiment.\n\nLFRAX Address = [https://arbiscan.io/address/0x2E9963ae673A885b6bfeDa2f80132CE28b784C40](https://arbiscan.io/address/0x2E9963ae673A885b6bfeDa2f80132CE28b784C40) \n\n#### **Voting**:\n\n- For: Add LFRAX to FXS gauge controller\n- Against: Do nothing.",

The available collaterals make VST one of the most decentralized stablecoins on the market. VST has seen more than 300k in volume consistently in the past 6 months (>2m on some days), making it one of the highest-traded stablecoins on Arbitrum. This volume has benefitted FRAX as well, driving lots of volume to Arbitrum FRAX. \n\nWe hope to further our collaboration via migrating the current VST-FRAX pool to a new VST-FRAXBP pool. Such a pool will drive more volume to the FRAXBP pool. The addition of USDC to the base assets of the LP makes it more attractive for liquidity providers, deepening liquidity for both VST and FRAX as a result. Therefore we suggests the addition of a new gauge for the VST-FRAXBP pool on Frax.\n\n### Voting:\nFor: Add the VST-FRAXBP Gauge\nAgainst: Do nothing",

      "content": "### Authors\n\nDennis\n\nNader Ghazvini\n\nSam Kazemian\n\n## Summary\n\nThis proposal aims to describe the frxETHBP and WETHR program and authorize an allocation of incentives to increase liquidity in AMMs, DAOs, and protocols with an underlying token of frxETH.\n\n## Background and Motivation\n\nFrax Ether is a liquid ETH staking derivative designed to uniquely leverage the Frax Finance ecosystem to maximize staking yield and smooth the Ethereum staking process for a simplified, secure, and DeFi-native way to earn interest on ETH.\n\nIn just 85 days, frxETH has gone from 0 to 50k in supply, which was an essential milestone for Frax and highlighted the success of its design. But it also shows that Frax Finance has a great product that can be quickly adopted by the mass market.\n\nHowever, as we look to the future, it's essential to focus on creating deep liquidity for frxETH. This will improve the trading experience for current holders, make it more attractive for new users to enter the market, and drive further adoption.\n\nThe WETHR (WETH Replacement) program is an incentive system made to make frxETH a viable alternative to WETH in smart contracts after Shanghai withdrawals are live.\n\n## Proposal Details\n\nWe propose allocating a budget for incentives to increase liquidity in AMMs with underlying tokens of frxETH. sfrxETH in liquidity pools or protocols is not eligible for this program. sfrxETH can receive their own independent incentives through the gauge system. The frxETH incentives include, but are not limited to, the following actions:\n\n* Bribing Gauge votes\n* Vote with protocol voting power\n\nThe Frax core team will spend it for frxETH liquidity proportional to the number of tokens in the liquidity pools, and using incentives will be AMM agnostic so that they can be used for any AMM platforms such as Curve, Fraxswap, etc.\n\n### Budget:\n\nThe budget for this proposal will be the farming rewards from frxETH and sfrxETH pools held by the frxETH Treasury and a **maximum of $2.4 million worth of FXS** from the bi-weekly Votium budget ([FIP](https://snapshot.org/#/frax.eth/proposal/0x606e06ce600e8f652ee04e2fdfb0ec11b09c78547d0eae3bf5bf8c9c5e214b28)) that can be spent for any AMM platform. It should be noted that this is the maximum amount that will be used for incentives and not necessarily the exact amount.\n\n## Proposal\n\n* For: Authorize an allocation of incentives to increase liquidity in AMMs with an underlying token of frxETH, with the mentioned details.\n\n* Against: Do nothing.",

      "content": "### Author\n\nDeFi Dave\n\n### Proposal\n\nGrant Flywheel $214.2k (50% in FRAX/50% in FXS) over the next year to continue activities promoting the Frax ecosystem and producing high-quality DeFi content. \n\n### Background\nOver the past 6 months, the relationship between Flywheel and Frax has done nothing but blossom and has played a pivotal role in shaping the narrative about Frax. The Frax Core Team have proven themselves to be the most talented builders in all of DeFi, shipping a plethora of primitives over the past year. But before Flywheel existed, Frax did not have an effective strategy for promoting their brand or educating the wider public. As the old mantra goes, if a tree falls in the forest and there is no one there to hear it, does it make a sound? It was clear that the Frax ecosystem needed assistance on that front and that help was not going to come from anywhere else but the community.\n\n[ You can read more about Flywheel and its performance over the last grant period in the original post in [Frax Governance forum. ](https://gov.frax.finance/t/fip-178-flywheel-grant-renewal-for-2023) ]\n\n### Proposed Grant and Budget Breakdown\n\nTotal Cost: $214.2k\n\n- Half of the grant will be streamed via llamapay and half the grant will be granted lump sum at the end of the year.\n\n- Of what is streamed via llamapay it will be 80% FXS and 20% FRAX. Of the lump sum it will be 80% FRAX and 20% FXS\n\nGrant Components\n\n- $104k to produce weekly episodes of Flywheel\n\n- $52k to produce weekly episodes of Frax Check\n\n- $25k for IRL Events\n\n- $15.6k for business development representation\n\n- $10k to produce Frax-branded merchandise\n\n- $5.1k for patronizing art and content\n\n- $2.5k for Frax-branded NFTs\n\nExtra Note\n\n- Section in 2024 grant proposal about the progress of independent income streams of Flywheel.\n\n### Team\n\nAnd just like last time, the people who are leading this initiative are:\n\n* Sam McCulloch ([@traders_insight](https://twitter.com/traders_insight)) long-time member of the Frax community. Executive producer of all content, co-host of Frax Check, contributor to the Flywheel website.\n* DeFi Dave ([@defidave22](https://twitter.com/DeFiDave22)) Day Zero Fraximalist. Co-host of Flywheel and Frax Check, contributor to the Flywheel website.\n* kapital_k ([0xkapital_k](https://twitter.com/0xkapital_k)) DeFi/Gaming/Tokenomics enthusiast and early Frax supporter. Co-host of Flywheel and Frax Check.\n\n### Motivation\n\nFlywheel has firmly established its role in the ecosystem as the destination for information and alpha regarding Frax. As an organic development, Flywheel essentially fills the role of a marketing department and due to its quality and reach is able to reach the target audience Frax is looking for. Yet like any department, Flywheel still needs funds to keep the lights on in order to continue pushing content out as well as interact with the wider community in a thoughtful and genuine manner. We hope with this round of funding we will be able to keep performing our duty as stewards of the Frax ecosystem and spreading Frax far and wide as it enters the next stage of its development.\n\nFrom the motivation section of our last proposal, there are still several points that ring true. Flywheel still aims to be the “Bankless of Frax” and take the wheel in driving the narrative for Frax and Foundational Deep DeFi forward. There is simply just too much at stake to do nothing and merely “hope for the best”, we need to keep actively engaging the wider DeFi community and beyond in order to inform, educate, and entertain them about Frax and its surrounding ecosystem. We strongly believe that Frax will reach Ethereum-level in size and along the way, Frax can not only scale technologically on-chain, but must scale socially off-chain as well.\n\nFlywheel has done an excellent job representing Frax so far and we are here to keep pushing the momentum forward. As mentioned in the last two proposals, the Frax ecosystem is growing to become much bigger than the core team alone and numerous contributors and commentators have arisen that have helped advance the protocol into the future. Flywheel is here to organize and shine a light on Frax, carrying the Fraximalist torch up high for those who seek it.\n\n### Proposal\n\n* For: Grant Flywheel $214,200 (split 50/50 between FRAX and FXS) to continue producing Frax-related content online and IRL\n* Against: Do Nothing",

      "content": "### **Authors**\n\nCLever Core Team\n\n## **Summary**\n\nAllocate 300000 $vlCVX votes for clevUSD/FraxBP for the next 6 epochs.  In exchange, CLever will offer Frax 15,000 CLEV tokens (0.75% of supply) vested over 3 months from the first vote.\n\n\n## **Background**\n\nCLever is a risk-minimized lending platform for high quality tokens such as CVX and FRAX. CLever loans are denominated in clevTokens, which are assets paired to their specific collateral and representing its future yield. clevTokens are treated as equivalent to their respective collateral by the system, so they carry no risk of liquidation and no exposure to price oracles. CLever does not charge interest on loans, but instead a fixed rate on yield harvests, which means borrowing costs do not change with any pool utilization or liquidity.\n\nCLever FRAX allows users to mint clevUSD against several Frax-based stablecoin collateral strategies, each with its own maximum LTV and independent yield. For CLever FRAX, all yields are swapped into FRAX, which is used to pay down their clevUSD system debt 1:1, then distributed via a stability mechanism called the Furnace.\n\nIn order for borrowers to utilize their borrowed tokens, CLever provides incentivized swap pools pairing each clevToken with its associated collateral. Sufficient liquidity in these pools facilitates swapping with reasonable slippage, and incentives create a yield farming opportunity for LPs of liquid FRAX with a unique risk profile. Since clevTokens represent future yield rather than a pegged asset (see next section) LP pairs are correlated, limiting the scope of impermanent loss to LPs and making these farms unique in the market.\n\nclevTokens are not wrappers of their underlying collateral tokens. Instead they represent future yield generated by collateral strategies, denominated in the collateral tokens. clevTokens can only be minted against their associated collateral, and only up to the maximum LTV for each given strategy (currently 30-50% for FRAX).  During bootstrapping CLever also imposes an overall borrowing limit for each strategy.  These limits will be raised as liquidity grows.\n\nclevTokens can eventually all be exchanged for corresponding real collateral tokens at 1:1 via the Furnace, so they can be considered a zero coupon bond with indefinite maturity. If the furnace currently holds collateral tokens the swap is immediate, but users can deposit clevTokens to the Furnace even if there are no collateral tokens currently available. In this case, users share the upcoming harvests proportionally with any other Furnace depositors. New harvests to the Furnace are released linearly over 1-2 weeks (depending on the collateral) which creates a smooth continuous burn rate/bond repayment and prevents timing exploits when the system is oversubscribed. The time required to convert clevTokens into their real underlying asset via the Furnace is determined by the collateral yield rate(s), as well as how many clevTokens are sharing those harvests in the Furnace.\n\nSince clevTokens represent future assets rather than current ones, they can trade at a discount representing the time value of those tokens like any bond. Borrowers swap when the discount is sufficiently small and, on the other side of the equation, users can buy clevTokens from the Curve pool to arbitrage the discount. This arbitrage can be repeatedly looped between the Furnace and the Curve pool as the Furnace converts clevTokens to their paired collateral assets.\n\n### **CLEV Tokenomics**\n\nCLEV is CLever’s native token and it uses Curve’s ve- tokenomic system, with lockers sharing platform revenue and progressively increasing governance power. CLever applies fees to the collateral token harvest yield, the majority of which will be distributed to veCLEV holders. This makes liquidity mining (or bribe payments) more sustainable than simple inflation because CLEV is a proxy for real, ongoing platform revenue in CVX, FRAX, and any future collateral tokens. The operation of CLever makes it a net buyer of CVX and FRAX. Locking CLEV is marketed as a set-and-forget way to earn a growing stable of hodl-worthy tokens.\n\n## **Motivation:**\n\nIncreasing liquidity and visibility for the clevUSD/FRAXBP pool is critical to the operation of CLever. It would also be beneficial and additive to the ecosystem in the following ways:\n\n- CLever’s model directly supports demand for underlying collateral strategies like FRAXBP farms by facilitating the creation of leveraged farming positions.\n- CLever provides unique new farming opportunities and by creation of yield bond markets and (liquid) clevToken-collateral farming.\n\n## **Proposal**\n\nIn order to create a deeper pool and to attract liquidity which will support clveUSD - Frax swaps we propose that Frax vote with 300,000 vlCVX for the clevUSD/FRAXBP pool for the next 6 epochs on Votium. In exchange, CLever will offer Frax 15,000 CLEV tokens (0.75% of supply) vested over 3 months from the first vote.\n\n- **For:** Allocate 300000 $vlCVX votes for clevUSD/FraxBP for the next 6 epochs.\n- **Against:** Do nothing",

Any token that is part of a Chainlink data feed can be lent to borrowers, or used as collateral. Each pair is an isolated, permission-less market that allows anyone to create and participate in lending and borrowing activities. Fraxlend creates new financial opportunities for all users and promotes FRAX adoption in the DeFi community.\n\nSince FIP - 137 authorized the Fraxlend AMO to issue a new FPI pair ( FPI/FRAX - Variable Rate V2 ), the pool has generated significant protocol revenues, as well as heavy lending and borrowing activity. Current pool utilization stands at 91% with total FPI collateral value at $17.8m. At time of writing, the lender APY is at 5.7% and borrower APY is at 6.2%. Both rates are rising quickly.\n\nBuilding on the success of the FPI pool, additional AMO injected liquidity would help bring the target pool utilization back down to the nominal range of 75% to 85%. More importantly, raising the liquidity cap would expand and diversify the borrower base to increase financial access for all users.\n\nWe note that authorizing the new higher limit does not require the AMO to provide the specified liquidity. The liquidity will be authorized and available to be injected, consistent with the AMO operations framework and protocol risk parameters, to meet user demand as deemed appropriate by the Frax Team.\n\n## Proposal\n\n* For: Increase maximum authorized allocation of Fraxlend AMO for the mentioned pair.\n* Against: Do nothing.",

      "title": "[FIP - 142] Frax Gauges on KyberSwap Elastic Ethereum, Polygon, Arbitrum and Optimism",
      "content": "**1. Summary:**\nThe outcome of this proposal is to make a FRAX pool one of the base pools on Kyber AMM’s stable swap on 4 chains Ethereum, Polygon, Arbitrum and Optimism. \n\nIn addition, Kyber has also had a successful campaign supporting Lido wstETH and stMATIC liquidity on 4 chains, and would like to run a similar campaign for Frax sfrxETH. \n\nThrough a combination of diverse pairings as well as our custom fee tiers, we can drive more volume through FRAX pools as well as sfrxETH pools.\n\n**Background and motivation:**\n\nKyberSwap Elastic AMM is a new tick-based AMM with high efficiency pools and liquidity settings which has ranked among the top DEXs across all chains in just four months since launch. With concentrated liquidity, Kyber performs especially well with stable pairs, as proven through the performance of its QiDAO $MAI pools and Lido [$wstETH](https://analytics.kyberswap.com/elastic/ethereum/token/0x7f39c581f595b53c5cb19bd0b3f8da6c935e2ca0) and [$stMATIC](https://analytics.kyberswap.com/elastic/polygon/token/0x3a58a54c066fdc0f2d55fc9c89f0415c92ebf3c4) pools.\n\nCurrently, there is a significant amount of TVL locked in both UniSwap and Curve, but this TVL is not being put in an efficient use where it can generate a decent amount of volume. In addition, Frax just launched wstETH-sfrxETH-rETH pool on Balancer with 1M of TVL but the pool does not have any volume till date. With FRAX pools as one of the stable base pools on Kyber, this can be fixed.\n\n**2. Kyber Recommendation:**  \n\nWe recommend gauges for the following pairs, which are built to optimize for and increase FRAX and sfrxETH volume:\n\n**Ethereum:** \n\nAdd these following pools:\n* FRAX - USDC (Fee tiers 0.01% or 0.04%)\n* FRAX - frxETH (Fee tiers 0.04%) \n\nAnd add one of the following pools: \n* frxETH - ETH (Fee tiers 0.01% or 0.04%) \n* sfrxETH - wstETH (Fee tiers 0.04%) \n* sfrxETH - FRAX (Fee tiers 0.3%) \n\n**Polygon**\nAdd this pool: \n\n* FRAX - USDC (Fee tiers 0.04%)\n\n**Arbitrum**\nAdd this pool:\n\n* FRAX - USDC (Fee tiers 0.04%)\n\n**Optimism**\nAdd this pool:\n\n* FRAX - USDC (Fee tiers 0.01%)\n\n**3. Benefits:**\n\n* Increased liquidity efficiency: Liquidity is not only optimized for volume across more diverse pairs and custom fee settings, but also benefits from custom routing through KyberSwap’s DEX Aggregator.\n* Partnership with a reputable and long term AMM protocol, which currently ranks 5 to 6 out of all DEXs across all chains (rank 2 on both Arbitrum and Optimism), in terms of daily volume. Current daily volume is at around $70m.\n* Co-marketing with a project which has a strong community and good traction across the four proposed ecosystems. \n\n**4. About Kyber**\n\nOur product KyberSwap - an AMM model - also shares several product features as UniSwap V3 in terms of concentrated liquidity, utilizing the tick-based method and using NFTs to represent liquidity positions.\n\nThe key differences are:\n\na. Re-investment curves: Whereas the LP fees on UniV3 are only claimable separately, KyberSwap Elastic has a reinvestment curve: LP fees on KyberSwap Elastic are claimable in a separate compounding pool [full range 50/50], meaning more returns for LPs.\n\nCompounding comparison:\n* UniV2/KyberSwap Classic: Fees compound into original position, most earnings\n* KyberSwap Elastic: Fees compound separately, middle earnings\n* UniV3: Fees don’t compound, claimable separately, least earnings\n\nb. Just-in-time (snipping attack) protection: KyberSwap Elastic also offers snipe/just-in-time protection. When a swap is executed, one can supply liquidity, swap into his own liquidity at a narrow range and skim the pool of fees, so the pool LP makes less: \n* More IL because less fees.\n* Some aggregators might use JIT as a way to find the best rates.\n* Somewhat similar to a front running attack.\n\nOur performance with LM has proven to be very strong on volume/tvl ratio: with only 54M in TVL we can facilitate almost 100M in daily trading volume. \n![Screenshot 2022-12-01 at 10.03.58|690x249](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard11/uploads/frax1/original/2X/b/bd57d2737a6d9a6a79cdfb85ecbee8b0174ef5f1.png)\n\n\n**5.

      "content": "## Summary\n\nDeploy an FXS gauge for Convex wrapped position of [XAI-FRAXBP Curve Pool LP](https://curve.fi/#/ethereum/pools/factory-v2-223/deposit).\n\nCurve Pool Address: https://etherscan.io/address/0x326290a1b0004eee78fa6ed4f1d8f4b2523ab669\n\n## Background & Motivation\n\nSilo [www.silo.finance] is a risk-isolated lending protocol that creates permissionless money markets. In our lending protocol, each market (or ‘silo’) consists of a base asset such as $FRAX and two bridge assets, ETH and our stablecoin XAI. Borrowers in each silo (market) are only exposed to the risk of 3 assets at any time rather than all the assets in the protocol. We have long had good standing with the Frax team with Sam serving as an indispensable advisor, and our decision to pair our governance token $SILO with FRAX on Curve.\n\nXAI is Silo’s over-collateralized stablecoin with a soft peg to the US Dollar. The SiloDAO is the only entity that controls XAI. Via executive proposals, the SiloDAO can choose to mint unlimited XAI and deposit it into any number of silos. Similarly, the DAO can burn XAI that is extended to any silos via governance proposals. When the DAO mints XAI into a silo, it effectively determines XAI’s backing. Similarly, when the DAO burns XAI in a silo, it changes XAI’s backing. After the recent passing of SIP-19, the current backing of XAI is 66.66% ETH and 33.33% USDC.\n\n**Benefits of XAI-FRAXBP Gauge:**\n\n1. Silo Finance will seed the pool with 3M USD XAI-FRAXBP.\n2. Silo Finance will provide Incentives through our 260,000 vlCVX.\n\n**Future Areas of Collaboration:** \n\nFollowing this proposal, Silo Finance has scoped and is ready to propose multiple collaboration efforts with the Frax community. In the future, you can expect to see the following potential partnerships coming into Frax governance for discussion:\n\n* sFRAX Gauge: A gauge for Frax staked in the Frax Silo akin to aFRAX.\n* frxETH/sfrxETH Silo: Silo Finance will work to enable a silo for frxETH further expanding its use case. We would also be more than happy to extend credit lines into this market.\n\nWe invite the Frax community to also voice their support/critique regarding these efforts.\n\n### **Voting Instructions**\n\n* For: Add gauge\n* Against: Do nothing",

      "content": "### Author\n\nHameed\n\n## Summary\n\nCreate a gauge for the FXS-FRAX pair on Fraxlend.\n\n## Background and Motivation\n\nFraxlend effectively allows the Frax protocol (via Fraxlend AMOs) to mint FRAX against various collateral types.  In most cases, the overcollateralized nature of the loans also increases the overall protocol collateral ratio.  This is probably the best method that is currently available to increase the protocol collateral ratio.  \n\nMinting FRAX against the FXS-FRAX pair on Fraxlend actually does the opposite as it increases the amount of FXS that is backing Frax.  This limits the liquidity that the protocol can add to the FXS-FRAX Fraxlend pair (via the AMO ) without decreasing the collateral ratio.  The FXS-FRAX pair currently has about 50% less liquidity than any other pair on Fraxlend because of these constraints.  I have heard from users that want to use this pair but need increased liquidity in order to do so.\n\nDeep liquidity on the FXS-FRAX pair benefits the protocol in a number of ways: increasing usage for Fraxlend, FRAX, and providing FXS holders the ability to access liquidity against FXS without selling their FXS.  As a borrower, it's important that there is sufficient liquidity to prevent extreme interest rate volatility that requires active management of the position (aside from collateral management).  Creating a gauge for the Fraxlend FXS-FRAX pair is the best means of creating deep liquidity for the FXS-FRAX pair without negatively impacting the protocol's collateral ratio.\n\n## Voting\n* For: Approve a gauge for the FXS-FRAX pair on Fraxlend\n* Against: Do nothing",

      "title": "[FIP-125] Exploratory Partnership to Pursue Propfi (RWA) AMO",
      "content": "## **Summary:**\nGreenlight collaboration on the design of a PropFi AMO to allocate stable liquidity to an initial property pool of high yielding single family real estate (SFR) assets.\n\n## **Background and Motivation:**\nPropFi is a real world asset (RWA) investment protocol, which will enable on-chain exposure to broadly diversified property portfolios, as well as other real world assets. PropFi has partnered with a number of firms which traditionally provide institutional-grade acquisition, development, and property management services to large insurance companies and private equity entities. \n\nThe sum total of this approach enables exposure to RWA at significant scale, in an on-chain environment. The PropFi solution also seeks to disrupt traditional REITs (both public and private equity) by using DeFi infrastructure to provide far greater efficiency, and thus higher net returns, greater liquidity, and unprecedented transparency. \n\nFocusing initially on SFR due to its resilience, relatively low volatility, low correlation with crypto investments, and stable yields, the protocol takes advantage of several unique characteristics that place it above previous attempts at incorporation of real estate or other RWAs into the blockchain space. \n\nThese include:\n-Scalability - working in close partnership with a nationwide tech-forward institutional manager  capable of deploying $125M per month in capital (and climbing), manage 200+ simultaneous renovations, and get us access to economies of scale in portfolio insurance, financing, and liquidity.\n-Frictionless user experience (easy on-chain  access to institutional grade portfolios of properties, without needing to leave the blockchain infrastructure layer, no hassle of withdrawals or bank transfers etc)\n\nThis is a particularly opportune time for integrating RWA to on-chain investment strategies, as it provides secondary access for institutional grade capital to the digital asset space, while offering digital native investors and protocols easy and seamless exposure to a countercyclical market hedge. This effectively enables preservation of wealth and provision of relatively high yields, even during crypto market drawdowns.\n\nPropfi will seek to deploy a $25-$50 million genesis pool of properties within the next 6-12 months, at such time as our advisors feel the macro picture is advantageous. This will be done within geographic regions targeting a 7-10% average total net annual return for all capital deployed into property (rental yield + capital growth).\n\nIn the interim, Propfi will seek to deploy invested funds into high interest very low risk cash and cash equivalent options.\n\n## **Background & Motivation:**\n\nThe long term health and stability of FRAX will, in part, require proper management of the underlying collateral pool. Portfolio management to preserve and grow assets as well as generate predictable income is incredibly difficult on-chain. There are relatively few diversifying assets available to digital investors and diversification is the cornerstone of long term institutional portfolio management. \n\nFor decades, large investment managers (e.g. insurance companies and private equity et al.) have used Single Family Rental real estate in their broad portfolios for exactly the reasons FRAX should: to hold an uncorrelated, relatively low volatility, stable-income producing asset with positive expected returns.  PropFi is the first, and only, institutional-grade, real estate portfolio token and our product is aimed at assisting organizations exactly like FRAX. \n\nThe Genesis PropFi fund is a fully on-chain, portfolio of USA-located SFR real estate. The Genesis fund token represents a fractional claim on the underlying real estate fund allowing an investor access to ongoing exposure to net capital appreciation and net rental income - with target returns of 4%-6% pa net capital growth and 3%-4% pa net rental yield (for a target net total return of 7%-10% pa). Unlike other on-chain real estate products, we are building a geographically diversified portfolio of quality properties, in quality neighborhoods, with an emphasis on stable returns, predictable and resilient income, and liquidity. \n\nThe real estate for the genesis fund will be acquired, renovated, and managed by one of the top (and very few) institutional TradFi R.E. operating companies in the U.S. The founder of the OpCo is a partner and advisor to PropFi and brings 20 years of SFR investment experience having closed over $10B in acquisitions. His current firm, and our trusted partner, has $1B invested with $1.5B of dry powder from large insurance companies. The same quality portfolio available to large insurance companies and private equity firms will be offered through PropFi. Our portfolios will have no degradation of service, quality, partnership, returns, or economies of scale due to our growth stage that other institutions might impose on a startup.\n\nThrough our partners we have an extraordinary edge: We can tap into up to $125M per month of acquisition capacity (predicted to be $200M/mo in 2023). We can also tap into 200-250 simultaneous renovations.  We can access institutional portfolio insurance, with pricing based on our partner’s portfolio (worth north of $1B). We have financing available from TradFi bulge bracket banks normally reserved for much larger organizations. We have also secured an advisory relationship with the former Head of Risk of a $14B SFR fund. She will operate as our acting Head of Risk while we are launching. \n\nOn net, PropFi is offering a diversified institutional-grade SFR investment that competes with some of the best private equity REITs, with no minimum investment, and vastly greater liquidity - all fully frictionless and completely on-chain for organizations like FRAX.\n\n\nFor full documentation and a detailed breakdown of protocol structure, see this presentation deck:\n[PropFi presentation deck](https://www.canva.com/design/DAFQt6ePCZU/eQeG8wiGqNQSubuGFriXrg/view)\n\n## **Vote Outcomes:**\n* For: Agree to establish an ongoing strategic dialogue with the PropFi team leading up to the initial pool seeding and fund deployment.  As the exact makeup of the initial fund are finalized, agree to discuss terms to greenlight an AMO allocating a fraction of collateral to the PropFi SFR Pool.\n\n* Against: Do nothing",

      "title": "[FIP - 123] Introduce 20% [RageQuit] function for TEMPLE/FRAX gauge",
      "content": "### Author:\nFraxiG\n\n## Proposal\nI'd like to propose the introduction of a [Ragequit] function for pools that pose no existential threat to Frax, if they were to unlock.\n\nWith some older pools having either dropped significantly in APY or the assets in the LP having become increasingly risky to hold, we're seeing an increasing number of people asking for unlocks or some way to get out of these \"dead\" and/or \"risky\" gauges.\n\nThe recent controversial discussions around the Temple/Frax LP pool being a perfect example. People have reached out to Temple team to figure out a solution. Temple currently came up with a migration of the LP's resulting in Temple taking over the locked LP's at a significant discount. This means value from Fraximalists flows to Temple treasury.\n\nAs long as those LP's stay locked the value doesn't necessarily leave the Frax ecosystem, however, if Temple ever decides to go for a Token swap this would warrant an unlock of the LP's and Temple can from that moment run off with the value extracted from the Frax eco.\n\nThis got me to thinking if there is not a better way to recycle this value and keep it in the Frax Eco. If we introduce an option for people to unlock their LP's, but make it so that unlocking incurs a cost (%slash) of said LP which ends up in the hands of Frax treasury, this could present a nice additional revenue source for the Frax Protocol. We could redistribute this value to veFXS holders to increase APR or whatever people can come up with, this can be discussed later.\n\nThis way instead of losing the value to the Temple treasury (for the example situation above), Frax could actually profit from it and increase their own.\n\nIf we could come up with a reasonable % for the slash I believe this could become a very useful function in which both The Unlockers and Frax Protocol \"win\". I do want to stress that this function, if introduced, should only be available for pools that are of either low TVL or have no significant risk to the protocol attached to it by unlocking.\n\nStarting with a 20% fee on the temple/frax LP will be a good exercise to see how feasible it is. \n\n## Voting\n* FOR: implement ragequit function for Temple/FRAX gauge (20% fee)\n* AGAINST: Do Nothing",

Once the cap is hit, a new vote should be taken to determine if the cap should be raised.\n\nPS: it's important to note that the active [leverage aka Credit Accounts] side of **Gearbox Protocol already has Frax3CRV and FraxUSDC integrated across Curve-yearn-Convex**, meaning Gearbox DAO is already a friend of Frax DAO and supporting us from the start.\n\n### What is Gearbox?\n\nGearbox is a generalized leverage protocol. It has two sides to it: passive liquidity providers who earn low-risk APY by providing single-asset liquidity [that is the target of this [proposal]; and active farmers, firms, or even other protocols who borrow those assets to trade or farm with even x10 leverage. *Essentially, those farmers-borrowers are the protocol utilization that bring organic APYs to lenders next to GEAR emissions.*\n\nGearbox Protocol allows anyone to take DeFi-native leverage and then use it across various (DeFi & more) protocols in a composable way. **You take leverage with Gearbox and then use it on other protocols you already love: Uniswap, Curve, Convex, Lido, etc.** For example, you can leverage trade on Uniswap, leverage farm on Yearn, make delta-neutral strategies, get Leverage-as-a-Service for your product, etc.\n\nSome fresh helpful info:\n\n- Their V2 product/protocol update with code open [[medium article](https://medium.com/gearbox-protocol/leverage-ninja-mode-gearbox-v2-is-open-for-business-in-a-few-hours-bf471e588033)]\n\n- Their Leverage Ninja guide, aka how composable leverage works [[medium article](https://medium.com/gearbox-protocol/leverage-ninja-mode-gearbox-v2-is-open-for-business-in-a-few-hours-bf471e588033)]\n\n- General user docs [[gitbook link](https://docs.gearbox.finance/)]\n\n### Security and risks\n\nGearbox is founded by [@0xmikko_eth](https://twitter.com/0xmikko_eth) [with @ivangbi as the shitposter] and has undergone several audits. Now, their protocol has no EAO admin signatures and is managed by a [DAO-enacted multisig with known founders in there 6/10](https://docs.gearbox.finance/governance/setup/multisigs). More information on Audits, including their recent top-tier audits with **ChainSecurity, Sigma Prime, and Consensys Diligence** - can be found here: **[Audits & Bug Bounty ](https://docs.gearbox.finance/risk-and-security/audits-bug-bounty)**.\n\nAs for the security of passive LP side, which is the topic of this proposal, it depends on several factors:\n\n* As with any lending protocol, third-party liquidations must work. They are open to anyone, [here is more information in their docs](https://docs.gearbox.finance/overview/liquidations) with the link to the V2 liquidator bot anyone can copy and run.\n\n* Related to the point above, LTVs of assets and assets themselves need to be safe & sound. Gearbox DAO has recently voted for the new batch of V2 assets, and also has an engamenent with Risk DAO. Their LTVs for long-tail assets seem extremely safe, and the composition of farms [Curve-Convex-yearn-Lido] include only the safest of the protocols. [See those details here](https://docs.gearbox.finance/overview/credit-account/allowedlist-policy). So the common saying \"*you are only as safe as your weakest link*\" seems to be addressed here.\n\n### Step-by-Step\n\nJust one step really:\n\nIn case this proposal goes through -> I have touched base with some Gearbox contributors, and confirmed that they have a plan to open a separate FRAX pool [[next to the current 5 passive pools](https://docs.gearbox.finance/liquidity-providers/pools-and-apy#what-is-a-diesel-token)] - with some GEAR emissions into it. We would then simply need to supply FRAX into that pool then.\n\n### Interesting considerations for the future\n\n1. Since Gearbox Protocol is doing so much with composability, it's possible that in the future some assets or contracts could not be desired by Frax DAO. In that case, we could ask for a separate Pool/Credit Manager setup whereas we would ask what risk we are comfortable with. [Modular](https://docs.gearbox.finance/overview/credit-account/how-to-add-new-assets-protocols)!\n\n2. Gearbox Protocol could become our avenue of integrations with other protocols, while isolating our risks and not having to build direct integrations. As such, we could increase the AMO cap as that FRAX liquidity would (a) bring revenues from leverage borrowers to Frax DAO (b) support FRAX liquidity across DeFi protocols as our APYs remain consistent and strong.\n\n# Voting\n\n* FOR: Authorize up to $2M FRAX for the Gearbox AMO to deposit treasury funds into. GEAR rewards will not be sold and will be kept for further protocol-to-protocol usage.\n\n* Against: Do nothing.",

      "content": "## Author\nFrax Core Developers\n\n# Summary\nFrom the total PoS earnings approve 8% protocol fee for FXS holders & 2% of earnings as slashing/operating insurance fund.\n\nStructure:\n1.) Minimum of 90% of ETH earned rewarded to sfrxETH vault stakers in the form of frxETH\n2.) 8% of earned ETH to Frax Protocol treasury in the form of frxETH. This ultimately will be distributed back to FXS holders.\n3.) Slashing Insurance Fund: 2% goes into a fund to cover potential slashing events/unforeseen penalties to cover frxETH deposits to effectively keep frxETH overcollateralized at over 100% CR to cover any possible issues/losses.\n\nNOTE: This structure will have to be modified once frxETH can support independently run validators in v2. There will have to be a validator-protocol split added to the structure. The current structure assumes that the Frax Protocol is the only entity running validators and thus the 8% fee covers the \"validator fee\" portion. This will not always be the case. For example, Lido's independent validators take a sizable portion of fees through the PoS yield and MEV/tips.\n\n# Background and Motivation\nWith the release of the frxETH liquid staking system, Frax Protocol now has a standalone system for issuing a liquid staking derivative, frxETH. This token is backed 1 to 1 by either liquid ETH or staked ETH in its entirety without any algorithmic or FXS backing. It is a fully collateralized staking derivative similar to stETH. \n\nThis proposal is to approve the initial fee structure of the system for frxETH version 1. The full Frax Ether documentation can be viewed [here](https://docs.frax.finance/frax-ether/overview).\n\nThe statistics and live status for validators can be viewed on Frax Facts [here](https://facts.frax.finance/frxeth/validators).\n\n# Voting\n\n* For: Approve proposed fee structure\n* Against: Do nothing.",

      "content": "### Authors\n\nDeFi Dave (Flywheelpod / PIF Labs), Jack Melnick (@yonijmel / The Tie)\n\n## Summary\n\nPartner with The Tie to increase institutional understanding, data access, and contact points for the FRAX ecosystem. This will be directly accomplished through a series of concrete deliverables, including:\n\n* Data Integration - Social, News, On-Chain\n* Analytics focused around FRAX KPIs and Protocol Health\n* Research and Video content designed to educate institutions on FRAX, and how best to get involved in the FRAX ecosystem\n* Connect FRAX’s most knowledgeable advocates directly to institutions via roadshows, messaging, and meeting scheduling\n\n## Background and Motivation\n\nMotivation: Provide FRAX with the opportunity to tell their story, in their words, to institutions- presenting data and information in a fairer and more accurate way, while also finding common ground with crypto’s most powerful investors.\n\n[The Tie ](http://thetie.io)is the leading provider of information services for digital assets. Our core offering, The Tie Terminal, is the fastest and most comprehensive workstation for institutional digital asset investors. The Terminal brings together real-time news from thousands of primary sources, with sentiment analytics, spot and derivatives, alternative, and on-chain data in a powerful and customizable platform. The Tie's clients include more than one-hundred of the leading traditional and crypto-native hedge funds, OTC desks, market makers, trading venues, banks, sell-side firms, and other institutional market participants.\n\n[Flywheelpod](https://twitter.com/flywheelpod) is a groundbreaking media and education platform that aims to increase awareness of Frax, as well as shine a spotlight on the global top builders and commentators on-chain. Our flagship podcast, Flywheelpod, is one of the fastest growing DeFi podcasts and has broken stories ranging from Fraxlend alpha to the “Real Yield” meme. Frax Check is a weekly update of how the Frax protocol is performing and gives an overview of the latest in governance. In addition, Money Moves leads the philosophical discussion around monetary policy while StableClaire helps beginners understand the basics of stablecoins.\n\nProblems Facing Token-Investor Relations:\n\n1. Data in the cryptocurrency space is fragmented, and existing platforms often paint token issuers in an inaccurate and unflattering light. Public companies get to provide context and clarity in their quarterly reports and IR dashboards, why shouldn’t tokens?\n\n2. In a market full of noise, it is difficult for many tokens to figure out which institutions matter and how to reach them\n\n3. In a cyclical, narrative driven, and fast moving market, important updates and top projects are often overlooked as investors constantly chase hype and ignore substance.\n\nPlan of Action & Deliverables:\n\n![|624x296](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard11/uploads/frax1/original/2X/e/e0f787b356e3f6f4822815a4c30a5b9756989dcc.jpeg)\n\n1.

Public Coverage - Asset verification report published on The Tie’s blog breaking down token, differentiators, token-economic model, and opportunities. Combination effort between Flywheelpod and Jack, who has extensive experience writing about and translating FRAX for institutional investors.\n\n6. Two seats to the The Tie Terminal to facilitate two-way connectivity with the 150+ funds using the platform (Normally priced at $12k/year). To be allocated by Flywheelpod with input from the FRAX team, until FRAX core protocol builds out an official marketing team.\n\nFinal Notes:\n\n* Early adopter pricing of $25K/year all-inclusive\n* Limited to twenty partners at launch\n* Confirmed Launch Partners include Avalanche and Polygon\n\n## Proposal\n\n- For: Join The Tie’s pilot program and authorize a $25,000 payment for a 1-year commitment, open to renewal\n\n- Against: Do Nothing",

This is POL liquidity provided by the team. It is used as the price for Coingecko and other aggregators.

Adding UniV3 LP incentives will improve arbitragers ability to fill those orders and keep markets tight. \n\nAdding gauges for these two pools will require addition of UniV3Staker (https://github.com/Uniswap/v3-staker). This will allow the protocol to pay out gauge rewards only to stakers who are in range. \n\nBecause of the need to rebalance and rotate on Uni V3 LP, locking bonuses should not be added.

      "content": "### Author\nFraxiG\n\n## Background\n\nWith the introduction of Temple’s STAX product and Convex entering the veFXS wars, Temple now has a vault with Convex Finance and utilizes Convex’s veFXS to get boosted FXS rewards. However, preConvex LP can’t migrate to this new vault, which means that STAX now has a stash of LP that’s boosted by Convex and a stash that is not.\n\nThe Templedao team has requested to allow preConvex LP’s to be migrated over.\n\n## Proposal\nI propose that we unlock the Temple/Frax LP pair to allow for migration. Doing so will allow Temple/Frax LP providers to move over to STAX and earn higher rewards by taking advantage of Templedao’s Convex vault.\n\n* For: Unlock the Temple/Frax LP pair\n* Against: Do nothing",

      "content": "### Authors\n\nFrax Core Team\n\n## Summary\n\nThe objective of this proposal is to authorize a $150k FRAX maximum donation to the next Gitcoin round at the discretion of the team.\n\n## Background and Motivation\n\nGitcoin is where the world’s leading web3 projects are born, validated & funded. This includes @[Uniswap](https://gitcoin.co/blog/case-study-uniswap-grants/), @[poapxyz](https://gitcoin.co/grants/490/poap-proof-of-attendance-protocol) & @[BanklessHQ](https://gitcoin.co/grants/238/bankless), just to name a few!\n\nGitcoin Grants allows individuals to get funding for a public goods project they are working on. It leverages Quadratic Funding (QF) to allocate extra funding from a matching pool to the most impactful projects based on the number of contributors. And this ensures that projects doing the most significant public good get the most support.\n\n![|291x381.97916666666663](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard11/uploads/frax1/original/1X/a0eef36d65c5ce03503b88e25e5180b1280f945a.png)\n\nThe latest Gitcoin Grants Round (GR15) featured three types of rounds:\n\n1. Main Round with $500k in matching funds\n2. 13 Ecosystem Rounds with a total of over $1.3 million in matching funds\n3. Four Cause Rounds with a total of $1M in matching funds (Climate Solutions, Crypto Advocacy, DeSci, DEI)\n\nIt was supported by multiple matching sponsors such as [Vitalik Buterin](https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin), [Aave](https://twitter.com/AaveAave), [Yearn](https://twitter.com/iearnfinance), [Polygon](https://twitter.com/0xPolygon), [ENS](https://twitter.com/ensdomains), [Chainlink](https://twitter.com/chainlink), and [1inch](https://twitter.com/1inch).\n\n![|624x204](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard11/uploads/frax1/optimized/1X/a6fdc010be3bcf211c76cdddbf25957c1b65f182_2_624x204.jpeg)\n\nWe believe our industry aims toward a paradigm in which smart contracts are the predominant type of digital agreement, which depends heavily on open-source contributions. Therefore, supporting open-source development is, in our opinion, an essential duty, particularly if blockchain infrastructure is to maintain its value as a vitally important public asset that benefits everyone.\n\n## PROPOSAL\n\n* For: Authorize $150k FRAX maximum donation to the next Gitcoin round at the team's discretion.\n\n* Against: Do nothing",

It is a lending platform that allows anyone to create a market between a pair of ERC-20 tokens. Any token part of a Chainlink data feed can be lent to borrowers or used as collateral. Each pair is an isolated, permission-less market that allows anyone to create and participate in lending and borrowing activities. This platform will open new financial opportunities for the FRAX community.\n\nAutomated Market Operations (AMOs) make FRAX one of the most potent stablecoin protocols, creating maximum flexibility and opportunity without altering the base stability mechanism that made FRAX a leader in the stablecoin space. So far, we have deployed multiple AMOs, including lending AMOs on the Aave and Rari platforms.\n\nCreating a Fraxlend AMO is the next step in this vision, allowing the protocol to mint FRAX backed by over-collateralized debt.\n\nIn the future, other Fraxlend pairs, along with the selected max authorized budget, can be added to Fraxlend AMO through a governance vote.\n\n### Proposal\n\n* For: Create a Fraxlend AMO and authorize up to $5m worth of liquidity for each of the mentioned Fraxlend pairs.\n* Against: Do nothing.",

      "title": " [FIP - 103] [Revised] Development of Liquidity Risk Profile Dashboard for Frax Finance",
      "content": "### **Proposal**\n\nWe propose to develop DeFi risk models and build summary risk dashboards quantifying Frax risk exposures and measures. While there are a few dashboards on activity and summary analytics of Frax, there are currently no risk models or risk frameworks that exist for any stablecoin, anywhere. These models and frameworks we propose to create will quantify all the various risk exposures so they can be properly identified, managed, and mitigated and open source to give further validation and confidence in Frax.\n\n### **Overview**\n\nWe will develop comprehensive beginning to end construction, tooling, and ongoing risk modeling for the Frax ecosystem, setting the standard for other stablecoins, and drastically reducing emerging regulatory risk exposure.\n\nThe skills and backgrounds necessary to build proper DeFi risk models and risk management framework requires the intersection of many fields including: financial risk modeling, on-chain analytics, technology development, treasury function including asset liability duration management, economic capital modeling and capital risk bucketing, liquidity risk identification and modeling, scenario analysis and stress testing, investment and collateral risk, monte carlo simulation, and sentiment analysis. The team has extensive experience in all of these areas and is best in class in the intersection of financial risk management and blockchain technology development.\n\nHere is a first phase implementation of the [Liquidity Risk Dashboard](https://irulast.com/frax). This dashboard operates purely against `api.frax.finance` and `eth-mainnet.alchemyapi.io` and can be hosted from Docker containers running anywhere at the discretion of Frax governance.\n\n### **Functional Collateralization Risk Dashboard Metrics**\n\nThe Frax dashboard summarizes the collateralization metrics and runs a VaR model which estimates the probability of Frax being able to fully meet its liabilities at any point in time for any forward looking horizon.\n\nThe initial implementation uses simple stress tests which quantify if there is less than a 1% chance of Frax able to fully meet its liability over a 1 and 3 month time horizons assuming no changes in liability or collateral ratio (which are big assumptions) but can be refined by incorporating a scenario analysis framework in the future. Some of the key risk measures are the overall Frax Collateralization, the Max % Safe Price drop of FXS, and the VaR stress tests which quantify a 99% confidence for the maximum likely price drop of FXS to meet all Frax liabilities over a set time horizon. For these measures, FXS market cap would cover the non-collateralized portion of Frax as part of Overall Frax collateralization. \n\nThis sort of risk modeling framework can help guide decisions for the protocol and manage and monitor risk exposures. As an example, it could help determine the Required Collateral Ratio by setting risk tolerance limits and having a data driven approach to strategic decisions and managing overall risk exposures depending on market conditions and risk premia. This is especially important in Crypto given the incredibly high volatility, and the recent blowups of other stable coin chains and protocols which were not implementing proper risk modeling and management. The urgency of implementing sound risk modeling frameworks across DeFi protocols is critical.\n\nThis is only a proof of concept dashboard just for collateralization. Our proposed risk dashboards would include many more risk models and measures.\n\n### **Proposed Engagement Activities and Services**\n\nWe propose to develop custom risk models and summary risk dashboards for Frax. These will quantify and model various risk exposures to allow for management and risk mitigation.\n\nA summary of the risk dashboards and example metrics along with detailed descriptions follows. These measures are quantified as point in time with customizable lookbacks (1hr, 1day, 1w, 1mo, 1q etc.) where appropriate, and will provide time series charting for the metrics. All the reports and dashboards will be designed to be persistent with little to no ongoing maintenance and allow user customization and risk reporting. Additional requested risk measures can be added interactively as requested.\n\n### **Detailed Risk Dashboards & Example Risk Metrics**\n\nLiquidity Risk Profile Dashboard\n\n* LCR (Liquidity Coverage Ratio) 1day, 1w, 1mo etc.\n* LVaR (Liquidity-adjusted VaR)\n* Quick and Current Ratios, capital position and collateral ratios\n* Structural liquidity metrics and stickiness (Tenor and behavior of collateral investors and redemption activity)\n* Liquidity exposure on Ethereum and Fantom by protocol (covering 85+% of the existing liquidity, future upgrades could include other chains and protocols)\n* Exposures across all liquidity pools by crypto asset such as USDT, USDC, DAI, and ETH\n* Structural correlation analysis between liquidity pools\n* Develop contingency funding plan and measures under various pre-identified liquidity stress scenarios\n* Scenario Analysis: Withdrawal of deposits, loss of exchange liquidity and volumes\n\nDevelopment Cost: $80,000 USDC\n\n*All the tooling will be persistent, open source, and adjustable by the Frax community.*\n\n### Poll\n- For: Allocate $80,000 USDC for the development of Liquidity Risk Profile Dashboard.\n- Against: Do nothing.",

      "title": "[FIP - 104] Creating a video for Frax Finance with DeFi Teller",
      "content": "## Summary:\nAllocation of up to $5K for creating one educational video by DeFi Teller.\n\n## Proposal:\nFrax Finance is a unique project and undoubtedly one of the key players in DeFi but surprisingly, we have not found quality and detailed videos about the technologies used in the protocol. We will be happy to fill this gap.\n\nSince the protocol is quite complex in its design, and its core concepts are not easy to grasp for newcomers to the field, we propose to make a video explainer about the technological aspects of Frax Finance, its key ecosystem components describing in simple words its innovative hybrid stablecoin design and the logic behind it. Specifically, how the platform maintains the FRAX peg to the U.S. dollar through a dual collateral-backed and algorithmic mechanism, get into the arbitrage-based minting and redemption process, the FXS token utility and so forth. We’ll also cover the AMOs and explain their modular design and much more.\n\n### **Who we are:**\n\nDeFi Teller is an educational resource that does the due diligence for the user by providing information about blockchain technology and decentralized applications (reviews, video explainers, on-chain data) in the most accessible way.\n\n### **What we are good at:**\n\n- Writing scripts targeted at an audience with an average level of knowledge in blockchain. We target people who have a basic understanding of how blockchain works, as well as a cursory understanding of the crypto market and its key players. Our viewer has probably already used dApps on the simple purchasing/trading/borrowing/staking level. Our task is to immerse this user deeper and explain in simple words what technology stands behind a particular project. In doing so, we take the presentation format very seriously and try to dig deep, figuring out what is under the hood of technologies and projects and what exactly makes them special. For example, this is how we explained what rollups are: https://youtu.be/XvSjNxZbThk\n\n- Creating distinctive visuals. The DeFi Teller team uses only original illustrations and takes a thoughtful approach to the process of video storyboarding. Our team of illustrators and animators works tightly with the editorial team, and the team of the project we're reviewing.\n\n### **Process:**\n\nThe existing DeFi Teller videos were created by us with our own funds and were highly praised by the teams of the projects we were talking about. For example, the Polkadot video was added to the welcome pages of the Polkadot and Kusama documentation. Further, we see our development in line with the spirit of decentralization - we would like to continue to talk about the most interesting DeFi projects and do so with nice graphics and quality scripts. We're not looking for profits coming directly from the teams, nor are we looking to create entirely commercial videos, reserving the right to choose the topics and angle of their coverage. All we need is to cover the cost of the video and support us in distributing the content (retweets, adding to documentation, and so forth).\n\nThe video creation process is as follows:\n\n-Writing script;\n\n-Creating storyboard;\n\n-Recording voice-over;\n\n-Animating the video;\n\n-Publishing the video on DeFi Teller resources (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4siZvLkAyiexFyPst1fC7w; Defiteller.guru, twitter.com/defiteller).\n\nComments, remarks and suggestions from the team are more than welcome at all stages of the video production.\n\n**Timeline:**\n\nThe timeline of the video depends on its budget.

As of writing, the only potential possibility of a viable fork is some form(s) of proof of work ETH alternative that does not merge the beacon chain with the geth execution clients thus keeping just the execution layer and proof of work consensus in place.\n\nFRAX is the 5th largest stablecoin in the world and 20%+ of Curve's TVL, a Uniswap top 10 token, and a critical piece of the Ethereum ecosystem. Thus, it makes sense to clearly make FXS holders' desire public knowledge through governance. It has been claimed that prominent fiat stablecoins such as Tether and USDC will only accept redemptions on PoSETH: https://blockworks.co/stablecoins-will-only-have-value-on-pos-ethereum-post-merge/. It would also be useful for FRAX to signal the same and have Frax DAO commit to capturing all significant value on ETHPoW, should it exist, and bring it to PoS ETH for FRAX redemptions making PoS ETH the canonical fork choice of all possible ETH forks post-merge.\n\n### **Proposal**\nIf there is significant value Frax DAO controls on  ETHPoW chain(s) (should any exist) then the core team will attempt to convert all assets on ETHPoW into ETH on PoSETH then deposit it into the DAO treasury msig as protocol controlled value to honor FRAX redemptions and increase the CR.\n\n- **For:** Support FRAX redemptions only on PoSETH and sell any significant value the protocol controls on ETHPoW into ETH and transfer to PoSETH protocol treasury.\n\n- **Against:** Do nothing",

      "title": "[FIP -100] Remove all canFRAX/canFXS swaps between bridges & remove bridge FRAX/FXS POL",
      "content": "#### **Authors**\nFrax Core Team\n\n### **Summary**\nRemove all swaps for canFRAX and canFXS from any bridge. Deprecate support for any wrapped representation of FRAX+FXS on any other chain leaving only natively issued FRAX+FXS on Ethereum mainnet.\n\n### **Background**\nFrax Finance pioneered the \"canonical stablecoin\" token architecture released in 2021 for [canonical FRAX and canonical FXS](https://docs.frax.finance/cross-chain/bridge). This allows each chain such as Moonbeam, Fantom, Polygon etc to have a native canFRAX ERC20 token contract which both the protocol and supported bridges can swap 1 to 1 between (up to certain limits). \n\nFor example, the canFRAX ERC20 contract on Polygon allows multiple different bridges to create canFRAX stablecoins by depositing 1 to 1 wrapped FRAX tokens representing bridged FRAX from Ethereum mainnet. If a user bridges 100 FRAX from Multichain to Polygon, they can deposit the 100 Multichain wrapped FRAX token to swap for 100 canFRAX on Polygon. If another user bridges 500 FRAX through the official Polygon bridge, they too can also bring their 500 wrapped FRAX and swap it for 500 canFRAX as well (minus swap fees). All AMMs, lending protocols, and AMOs use canFRAX of their respective chain so liquidity is not fragmented and 1 single address for FRAX becomes canonical per chain. This has very powerful network effects to make 1 FRAX token the default stablecoin rather than multiple kinds of bridged FRAX each with low liquidity and use cases.\n\nMakerDAO recently announced they are releasing a similar feature (oddly named the exact same as canFRAX called canDAI): https://medium.com/bankless-dao/canonical-dai-stablecoin-upgrade-aims-to-help-move-dai-off-chain-2a8de6a815c1 This proves that the canonical stablecoin architecture is the best way for a stablecoin to grow on other chains and build a network effect around a single token address. \n\nHowever, there is one specific problem with the canonical stablecoin system: the bridge tokens that are swapped 1 to 1 for canFRAX are held within the protocol's ownership and thus expose the risk of multiple bridges. Additionally, a single bridge being hacked removes liquidity for canFRAX users since some of them won't be able to swap back to Ethereum (the native home for the Frax protocol and all FRAX, FXS, FPI, FPIS tokens) due to part of the liquidity being worth $0 . We saw this occur with the Harmony 1Bridge hack where some canFRAX on Harmony is now stranded without the ability to bridge that amount of canFRAX back to Ethereum. This is also currently happening with canFRAX on Moonbeam as we speak due to the Nomad bridge hack. Essentially, the current structure of canFRAX is that it is not technically a native liability of the Frax protocol but simply a pooled representation of of all bridged versions of FRAX on the destination chain that diversifies the bridge risk but does not remove it. This is why when a bridge is hacked like Nomad or Harmony, users of canFRAX are rightfully concerned what happens to their canFRAX stablecoins on their chain since the backing of those canFRAX has significantly taken a hit. \n\nThis governance proposal aims to change the above structure and remove bridge swaps between canFRAX+canFXS stablecoins. This means that if you hold canFRAX on any chain, it is fully backed by the Frax protocol's value and collateral on Ethereum mainnet and the CR is correctly displayed for all canFRAX and Ethereum mainnet FRAX combined. However, in order for you to be able to bridge canFRAX and canFXS back to Ethereum, there will need to be liquidity providers in Curve pools, Fraxswap, other AMMs that pair wrapped bridge tokens such as anyFRAX with canFRAX creating swap pools. This means the risk of bridge hacks and bridge risk is entirely offloaded to LPs of these bridge pools that pair canFRAX with different wrapped versions of FRAX bridged from Ethereum. For example, in order to exit your canFRAX on Fantom through the Multichain bridge to Ethereum, there must be a Curve pool that has liquidity between anyFRAX-canFRAX so that a user swaps for anyFRAX, then uses that to return to Ethereum. Bridge partners can apply for FXS gauge pools for these \"bridge liquidity pools\" but the protocol will no longer support them with POL or 1 to 1 swappers for canFRAX or canFXS. \n\nCount-intuitively, should this proposal pass, it could make canFRAX one of the safest assets on non-ETH chains because it has the full faith and commitment to redeem against FRAX on Ethereum L1 while having 0 bridge risk. Chains that use a specific bridge as the predominant way to bring all tokens to their chain such as Fantom using Multichain bridged assets or Moonbeam using Nomad assets means that if those bridges are hacked, almost all tokens are worthless on their entire network except for canFRAX or canFXS. Hypothetically if Multichain was hacked, then USDC, USDT, ETH, WBTC, and almost all other tokens would be worth 0 on Fantom since all liquidity pools and projects use the wrapped bridge version of those tokens through Multichain. Fantom has almost no natively issued blue chip tokens other than FTM itself. \n\nIn the above example, canFRAX would still retain its full peg and value regardless of any other bridge risk or what any chain uses as their main bridge since canFRAX holders would not be at all exposed to any kind of bridged asset whatsoever. Put in another way, there could be situations where every asset on another chain is worthless other than canFRAX and their L1 token if this governance proposal passes.\n\n### **Proposal** \nRemove all swaps from canFRAX and canFXS on all chains with their supported bridges. Remove all protocol owned liquidity and all protocol ownership of wrapped bridge FRAX & bridged FXS on every chain.\n\n- **For:** Deprecate all 1 to 1 swaps between canFRAX & canFXS in their respective contracts on all chains. Remove all protocol owned wrapped/bridged FRAX+FXS from balance sheet. \n\n- **Against:** Do nothing",

      "content": "### Summary\n\nDevelopment of Liquidity Risk Profile Dashboard for Frax Finance\nThis dashboard includes:\n* *LCR (Liquidity Coverage Ratio) 1day, 1w, 1mo etc.** *LVaR (Liquidity-adjusted VaR)*\n* *Quick and Current Ratios, capital position and collateral ratios*\n* *Structural liquidity metrics and stickiness (Tenor and behavior of collateral investors and redemption activity)*\n* *Liquidity exposure on Ethereum and Fantom by protocol (covering 85+% of the existing liquidity, future upgrades could include other chains and protocols)*\n* *Exposures across all liquidity pools by crypto asset such as USDT, USDC, DAI, and ETH*\n* *Structural correlation analysis between liquidity pools*\n* *Develop contingency funding plan and measures under various pre-identified liquidity stress scenarios*\n* *Scenario Analysis: Withdrawal of deposits, loss of exchange liquidity and volumes*\n\nDevelopment Cost: $80,000 USDC\nOngoing Cost: $1,500 USD per month (Credmark fees)\n\n### **Proposal**\n\nWe propose to develop DeFi risk models and build summary risk dashboards quantifying Frax risk exposures and measures. While there are a few dashboards on activity and summary analytics of Frax, there are currently no risk models or risk frameworks that exist for any stablecoin, anywhere. These models and frameworks we propose to create will quantify all the various risk exposures so they can be properly identified, managed, and mitigated and open source to give further validation and confidence in Frax.\n\nThe analysis and on-chain risk modeling will be implemented with Credmark protocol. Credmark is a full stack Defi financial modeling platform that runs natively in Python which allows us to move beyond simple analytics and develop sophisticated forward looking financial risk models. We run our own database of indexed Ethereum data, python based dev-tooling, and cloud infrastructure for building and executing complex financial models. This enables DAOs and financial institutions to use comprehensive and accurate on-chain financial metrics.\n\nThe Credmark team has published numerous research reports including a detailed post-mortem of the Terra ecosystem collapse Additionally, Debt DAO leverages Credmark’s technology and expertise in order to evaluate counterparties cash flow and treasury in order to determine appropriate loan terms. One such loan proposal was recently passed by the Frax community via governance vote.\n\n### **Overview**\n\nWe will develop comprehensive beginning to end construction, tooling, and ongoing risk modeling for the Frax ecosystem, setting the standard for other stablecoins, and drastically reducing emerging regulatory risk exposure.\n\nThe skills and backgrounds necessary to build proper DeFi risk models and risk management framework requires the intersection of many fields including: financial risk modeling, on-chain analytics, technology development, treasury function including asset liability duration management, economic capital modeling and capital risk bucketing, liquidity risk identification and modeling, scenario analysis and stress testing, investment and collateral risk, monte carlo simulation, and sentiment analysis. The team has extensive experience in all of these areas and is best in class in the intersection of financial risk management and blockchain technology development.\n\nHere is an example Frax analytics and trading dashboard recently completed with Credmark:\n[Example](https://app.powerbi.com/view?r=eyJrIjoiNzFmMjNmZDYtY2VjYy00NDcyLTgxOTUtNDc1ZGFiODAzOTk1IiwidCI6ImZlMjVkZDFmLTFjODktNDBhYi04ODdiLWQzYmY2ZjA2MjI5MyIsImMiOjEwfQ%3D%3D) (Frax/FXS/FPIS distribution and inflows/outflows).\n\n**Functional Collateralization Risk Dashboard Metrics**\n\nThe Frax Collateralization Metrics uses Credmark on-chain data and risk modeling framework. The dashboard below summarizes the collateralization metrics and runs a VaR model which estimates the probability of Frax being able to fully meet its liabilities at any point in time for any forward looking horizon.\n\nThe initial implementation also uses simple stress tests which quantify if there is less than a 1% chance of Frax able to fully meet its liability over a 1 and 3 month time horizons assuming no changes in liability or collateral ratio (which are big assumptions) but can be refined by incorporating a scenario analysis framework in the future. Some of the key risk measures are the overall Frax Collateralization, the Max % Safe Price drop of FXS, and the VaR stress tests which quantify a 99% confidence for the maximum likely price drop of FXS to meet all Frax liabilities over a set time horizon. For these measures, FXS market cap would cover the non-collateralized portion of Frax as part of Overall Frax collateralization. As below the 90day Horizon stress test fails because the VaR of -88% is greater than the max Safe Price drop of -76.6%.\n\n![Screen Shot 2022-07-24 at 7.17.11 PM|690x386](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard11/uploads/frax1/original/1X/eaa0cc891a966b772ee02ae7cd020d0af71c7f96.png)\n\nAs a comparison and validation, the collateralization metrics and VaR models as of Apr 20, 2022 (before the Terra UST collapse) are detailed below to determine how the risk exposures have changed.\n\nAs can be seen from the collateralization metrics comparing July to April, there was a significant deterioration in the Overall Frax Collateralization from 175% to 124%, and the Frax treasury as well which was dominated by FXS. The other change is the decrease in Max % Safe Price drop of FXS from 85% to 76%, and the massive increase in VaR in July driven by the 85% price drop of FXS from April into May. In response the collateral ratio was also increased.\n\nIn summary overall risk exposures have increased, although Frax is still in a very healthy risk position with many levers to manage risk.\n\nAnother potential area of further risk analysis is the high Beta of FXS relative to the Frax market cap (overall liability) and the high percentage of Frax treasury dominated in FXS. The overall Frax market capitalization declined from $2.6b to $1.4b which is almost a 50% drop, yet the FXS price declined from $35 to $6 which is about an 80% drop, indicating a Beta of around 1.6.\n\nAs part of a contingency funding plan framework for market stress scenarios that might be needed to cover the liability, diversifying some portion of treasury into other assets that are not correlated to the Frax liability (market cap) would strengthen the overall risk profile of Frax if it’s ever needed to intervene during times of market stress.\n\nThis sort of risk modeling framework can help guide decisions for the protocol and manage and monitor risk exposures. As an example, it could help determine the Required Collateral Ratio by setting risk tolerance limits and having a data driven approach to strategic decisions and managing overall risk exposures depending on market conditions and risk premia. This is especially important in Crypto given the incredibly high volatility, and the recent blowups of other stable coin chains and protocols which were not implementing proper risk modeling and management. The urgency of implementing sound risk modeling frameworks across DeFi protocols is critical.\n\nThis is only a proof of concept dashboard just for collateralization. Our proposed risk dashboards would include many more risk models and measures.\n\n**Proposed Engagement Activities and Services**\n\nWe propose to develop custom risk models and summary risk dashboards for Frax. These will quantify and model various risk exposures to allow for management and risk mitigation.\n\nA summary of the risk dashboards and example metrics along with detailed descriptions follows. These measures are quantified as point in time with customizable lookbacks (1hr, 1day, 1w, 1mo, 1q etc.) where appropriate, and will provide time series charting for the metrics. All the reports and dashboards will be designed to be persistent with little to no ongoing maintenance and allow user customization and risk reporting. Additional requested risk measures can be added interactively as requested.\n\n### **Detailed Risk Dashboards & Example Risk Metrics**\n\nLiquidity Risk Profile Dashboard\n\n* LCR (Liquidity Coverage Ratio) 1day, 1w, 1mo etc.\n* LVaR (Liquidity-adjusted VaR)\n* Quick and Current Ratios, capital position and collateral ratios\n* Structural liquidity metrics and stickiness (Tenor and behavior of collateral investors and redemption activity)\n* Liquidity exposure on Ethereum and Fantom by protocol (covering 85+% of the existing liquidity, future upgrades could include other chains and protocols)\n* Exposures across all liquidity pools by crypto asset such as USDT, USDC, DAI, and ETH\n* Structural correlation analysis between liquidity pools\n* Develop contingency funding plan and measures under various pre-identified liquidity stress scenarios\n* Scenario Analysis: Withdrawal of deposits, loss of exchange liquidity and volumes\n\nDevelopment Cost: $80,000 USDC\nOngoing Cost: $1,500 USD per month (Credmark fees)\n\nAsset Liability Mismatch Dashboard\n\n* Summary of Assets vs Liability exposures & leverage ratios\n* Long Term Funding Ratio (LTFR) (Contractual maturity mismatch)\n* Term structure of funding assets and liabilities & duration gaps\n* Average asset duration, average liability tenor\n* Surplus funding capacity\n\nCollateralization Risk Dashboard\n\n* Collateralization measures\n* VaR models\n* Counterparty exposures and measures\n* AMO risk exposures\n* De-Centralization ratio\n* Pool exposures and trading activity\n\nScenario Analysis & Stress Test Dashboard\n\n* Identification of several stress test scenarios and modeling their impact on risk measures and exposures\n* Ability to tweak and customize the scenarios and run user defined stress testing\n* De-pegging scenario analysis impact across all aggregated Frax Liquidity pools\n* Analogous UST like de-degging scenario\n* Individual & aggregate Liquidity pool stress testing\n* Funding withdrawal redemptions\n* Tolerance Stress tests - Identification of limits that would de-peg Frax and how far away those are from current market conditions.\n* In all of these scenarios, quantification of how all the Liquidity, ALM and other risk metrics change\n\n**All the tooling will be persistent, open source, and adjustable by the Frax community.**\n\n*** For more details you can check Frax Governance Forum . . .",

      "title": "FIP 99 - Flywheel Sponsorship Proposal",
      "content": "### Author(s)\n\nDeFi Dave\n\n### Proposal\n\nGrant $60,000 of FXS and FRAX (split 50/50) for a 6 month period in order to fund Flywheel which will continue its efforts producing content covering the Frax ecosystem. In addition, we intend to continue to host meetups IRL as well under the “Fraximalist” Brand. In return, we will have FRAX sponsor our long-form content and advertise primitives such as Fraxswap, Fraxlend, FPI, and FrxETH.\n\n### Background\n\nOver the past 3 months, Flywheel has made incredible strides for producing content for the Frax ecosystem and has been able to expand Frax’s media footprint online, executing on its goals laid out in the original Podcast & Media grant of taking control of its own narrative as well as educating the wider community.\n\n![|624x245](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard11/uploads/frax1/original/1X/06b9b55d6392842a70b0a8780deac5cba77ee53d.png)\n\n![|422x574](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard11/uploads/frax1/original/1X/5cdc49c136f60cbf9e743fb689a7fd40b7fd6cfd.png)\n\n![|483x89](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard11/uploads/frax1/original/1X/18f83d6c2bae6a38e8aefb8d856cc65ef1142618.png)\n\n![|483x486](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard11/uploads/frax1/original/1X/64faf0aaea30972039fd4fb796ffbc8b15bb998c.png)\n\n![|505x74](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard11/uploads/frax1/original/1X/1fc14ce3dab64a1ffe6810029d9681584b751129.png)\n\n#### Flywheel Output\n\nSince Flywheel launched 3 months ago we have:\n\n* Over 430 subscribers on YouTube\n* Over 900 followers on Twitter\n* Produced two episodes with over 1000 views\n* Created 3 different series including Flywheel Pod, Fraxcast, and StableClaire Explains\n* Fund institutional-level pieces of Frax in the Flywheel substack.\n\nThese numbers show the incredible traction that Flywheel has received. The response to Flywheel has been overwhelmingly positive by both people in and outside the Frax community who are hungry for quality content. This is important because there is noticeably a media vacuum in crypto that has not kept up with the sheer speed of segmentation happening in Web3 as a whole. Flywheel is carving out its corner of the media space through covering and making sense of the Frax ecosystem through interviews, commentary, and explainers.\n\nIn the future, we want to continue producing Flywheel content and will use these funds to cover expenses and labor hours spent prepping, recording, editing, and distributing content. You can keep up with Flywheel on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/flywheelpod), [Telegram](https://t.me/flywheelpod), [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChktQbmIzLZKSwEZh8yE1Kw), [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/show/34xXNO2...), and [Apple](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/flywheel/id1628697864). Specifically, this grant will help fund:\n\n* A consistent stream of content related to the Frax ecosystem including:\n  * Our flagship podcast, Flywheel, which brings on members of the community and protocol partners to discuss the latest developments in Frax, DeFi, stablecoins, and everything in between. We have been releasing one episode a week since launch and will keep going at that pace.\n  * In addition, we plan on continuing to release other content such as Fraxcast which is general commentary about the Frax ecosystem and StableClaire Explains... which covers the basics of understanding stablecoins and Frax. We intend to release this content on a more consistent basis.\n* Advertisements for Frax primitives\n  * Frax has recently released or is releasing a host of novel DeFi primitives including Fraxswap, Fraxlend, FPI, and FrxETH. Although people in the Frax community may be aware of them, there are many who are not. With these advertisements, we intend to further entrench the mutually symbiotic relationship between Frax and Flywheel by educating viewers about these primitives in short adverts.\n\nThe people who are leading this initiative include:\n\n* Sam McCulloch ([@ssmccul](https://twitter.com/traders_insight)) who is a long-time member of the Frax community and has had a podcast of his own. Sam will be the lead and producer for the unit and will act as producer to both shows as well as co-host the Frax Town Square.\n* DeFi Dave ([@davesaidthat_](https://twitter.com/davesaidthat_)) who is a Day Zero Fraximalist and has hosted a podcast in the past, The DeFi Scoop. He will co-host both Flywheel and Frax Town Square.\n* kapital_k ([0xkapital_k](https://twitter.com/0xkapital_k)) who is a DeFi/Gaming/Tokenomics enthusiast and Frax supporter who has researched the protocol deeply.\n\nIn the previous three months, expenses have primarily incurred from production of Flywheel. For those who are curious of how the Treasury has been utilized, you can see a breakdown of it [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_rQ9FyLkQDRGFd3h50Bfi9aGZA0SpBp9G0i-0423u6Q/edit?usp=sharing). It is important to note that DeFi Dave and kapital_k have not taken any compensation for their efforts choosing instead to reinvest in building up Flywheel. In addition, PIF Labs has been aiding in commissioning the institutional-level writing content for Flywheel.\n\n#### Fraximalist Meetups\n\n![|498x534](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard11/uploads/frax1/original/1X/c020818baba6a93a2c1183b2886250cff4331a29.jpeg)\n\nFraximalist meetups are IRL gatherings of enthusiasts and curious alike and so far, three of them have taken place in Amsterdam (during Devconnect), New York (during NFT NYC), and (Paris during EthCC). The latest one in Paris attracted nearly 30 attendees who listened to DeFi Dave’s speech as well as stuck around for a merch giveaway.\n\nIn the future, Fraximalist meetups can host panels, discussions, and bring together thinkers & active players alike from across DeFi. Several conferences that Fraximalists meetups can take place at in the near future include:\n\n* MCON Sept 6-9\n* Messari Mainnet Sept 21-23\n* DevCon Oct 11-14\n* ETH Lisbon Oct 28-30\n\nThe goals of curating events are to create a sense of community, cultivate substantive discussion, and represent the protocol IRL. As part of Flywheel’s outreach efforts on behalf of Frax, organizing these meetups is an essential component of the marketing stack to increase awareness of Frax.\n\nFunds from this grant will help cover the costs associated with hosting events including securing physical locations, setting up props, having food/water/amenities, as well as labor hours setting up and executing events.\n\nDeFi Dave has been and will continue to lead the Fraximalist meetup series.\n\n![|408x435](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard11/uploads/frax1/original/1X/63afd4db029d23e3c2f2955a25a123611f277a5c.jpeg)\n\n### Motivation\n\nFlywheel aims to be the “Bankless of Frax” and take the wheel in driving both Frax’s and the automated stablecoin narrative forward. There is simply just too much at stake to do nothing and merely “hope for the best”, we need to keep actively engaging the wider DeFi community and beyond in order to inform, educate, and entertain them about Frax and its surrounding ecosystem. We strongly believe that Frax will reach Ethereum-level in size and along the way, Frax can not only scale technologically on-chain, but must scale socially off-chain as well.\n\nFlywheel has done an excellent job representing Frax so far and we are here to keep pushing the momentum forward. As mentioned in the last proposal, the Frax ecosystem is growing to become much bigger than the core team alone and numerous contributors and commentators have arisen that have helped advance the protocol. Flywheel is here to organize and shine a light on Frax, carrying the Fraximalist torch up high for those who seek it.\n\n### Breakdown of the sponsorship/grant\n\nTotal cost: $60k (half $FRAX/half $FXS)\n\n#### **Podcast(s) Budget**\n\n* 52 episodes over the span of 6 months with Frax-related ad of Fraxswap and other Frax primitives when released\n\n* Cost per episode $1000, totaling $52k.\n\n#### **Contracted Content Budget**\n\n* $2000 total for video explainers about Frax and stablecoins directed towards a novice audience\n\n#### **Meetups/Events Budget**\n\n* $6000 for hosting Fraximalist meetups and events.\n\n#### **Extra Incentives**\n\n* Reach 1000 subscribers on YouTube, $500.

      "title": " FIP 98 - Arable arUSD Stability Fund Gauge",
      "content": "## Summary\n\nAdd the Arable arUSD Stability Fund to the Gauge System\n\n## Background and Motivation\n\n### Benefits for FRAX Holders\n\n1. ACRE airdrop to everyone who participates in the voting process upon successful passing of the proposal as a good-faith partnership action.\n2. ACRE rewards for participants in the Arable arUSD Stability Fund.\n3. This partnership between Arable and the FRAX community will lead to increased visibility of each other’s communities.\n\n### The Protocol\n\nArable Protocol is a DeFi platform that focuses on synthetic farming and trading. Our objective is to make multi-chain farming accessible, affordable, and simple for everyone. Both seasoned and novice farmers can easily stake yield farms from various chains thanks to a user interface that is straightforward but effective. Arable Protocol is based around a synthetic ecosystem and its liquidity is created through the minting of the stable asset arUSD. Users can exchange between different LP tokens and synthetic cryptocurrencies using arUSD, and they can farm on synthetic yield farms that follow the APR of their native chain counterparts.\n\n### The Stability Fund\n\nThe Arable arUSD Stability Fund is a multi-token contract that allows swapping between multiple stable assets, including arUSD, FRAX, and other stablecoins like USDT and USDC. All participants in the Arable arUSD Stability Fund earn extra ACRE rewards as an incentive.\n\nThe Stability Fund is an unbalanced pool, meaning you do not need to deposit a combination of tokens of equal value as is common with Uniswap-style contracts. Any desired amount of a supported stablecoin can be deposited on its own.\n\nDuring the arUSD Stability Pool’s operation, users will be able to swap between any stablecoins at a fixed ratio of 1:1 without any slippage. If at any time a side of the pool runs out of liquidity, only swaps into a stablecoin where liquidity is available are possible.\n\nThe arUSD stability pool will only be in operation for a limited time during the early launch phase of Arable MVP. Once the protocol reaches one million minted arUSD, public pools will go live on 3rd party DEXs. The arUSD stability pool contract will be used as a stability fund once the public pools are up and running to keep the price of the arUSD and the USD on parity and to buffer large buy and sell operations in the early phase of the protocol.\n\nWe propose to add the Arable arUSD Stability Fund, which includes FRAX, arUSD as well as other stablecoins like USDT, USDC and YUSD, to the Gauge System.\n\n## PROPOSAL\n\nFor: Add the Arable arUSD Stability Fund to the Gauge System\n\nAgainst: Do nothing",

Alongside incentives outlined in FIP-95, FraxBP metapools should, on top of their respective CRV gauges, also receive FXS gauges to further incentivize migration to the FraxBP family.\n\n### Abstract\n\nAs with previous FIPs 90 and 57, we propose that the following Curve pools receive a Convex wrapped position FXS gauge.\n\n* sUSDFRAXBP\n* USDDFRAXBP\n* GUSDFRAXBP\n* TUSDFRAXBP\n* alUSDFRAXBP\n* LUSDFRAXBP\n* BUSDFRAXBP\n* apeUSDFRAXBP\n\nThe staking token is a wrapped Convex staking position represented by an erc-20 that receives CRV and CVX rewards. This token can then be staked on a Frax Finance gauge to then also receive FXS rewards.\n\nThe wrapped staking position itself is an unmanaged trustless position and can be found on the Convex github at https://github.com/convex-eth/platform/tree/main/contracts/contracts/wrappers\n\n## Voting\n\n* For: Add the listed pools to FXS gauge controller as staked Convex positions\n* Against: Do nothing",

      "content": "#### Authors\n\nC2tP (Convex Finance)\n\nSam (Frax Finance)\n\nDennis (Frax Finance)\n\n# Proposal\n\n## Background & Motivation\n\nNow that the FraxBP is live and the Frax Finance whitelist proposal will end soon (https://dao.curve.fi/vote/ownership/196). We would like to define how the FraxBP Protocol Owned Liquidity farming revenue will be handled as well as incentives for Frax and FraxBP related AMM pools.\n\nOriginal Curve governance proposal can be found here: https://gov.curve.fi/t/deploy-a-fraxbp-pool-whitelist-frax-for-vecrv-staking/3958\n\n### Section 1: FraxBP Revenue\n\nAs stated by Sam of Frax in the Curve governance forums, Frax will move to be even more symbiotic with the Curve ecosystem. Up until now, CRV farmed was sold to FXS. This FXS was used for further incentives and/or platform revenue. Frax will now shift into a new strategic position with farmed rewards to eliminate this sell pressure while still allowing itself a means to utilize the token's value.\n\nAs Frax farms CRV and CVX emissions from FraxBP, Frax will:\n\n* Lock all CVX as vlCVX\n* Lock at least 5% of CRV as veCRV\n* Use remaining CRV to acquire(direct deposit or purchase at team discretion) cvxCRV\n\nThe cvxCRV can be used as voting incentives. The cvxCRV not used for incentives will be staked for revenue.\n\nThe veCRV rule is only a minimum.\n\nThe ratio of how much is locked, staked, or used as incentives is determined by the Frax team while looking at current market conditions.\n\nThis setup gives the Frax team a large leeway in how it can fund the FraxBP and hold on to what it can given the ever changing market conditions. Making sure the FraxBP is well funded is a higher priority than increasing treasury assets. The held treasury asset balances and types can be reassessed again at a later point once the ecosystem around FraxBP has grown and stabilized.\n\n### Section 2: Voting Incentives and Gauge Weight\n\nFrax will continue providing voting incentives for Frax pools on the Votium platform. As described in the original Curve proposal, Frax will also strive to be an active partner for pools that decide to pair with the FraxBP by contributing to voting incentives for FraxBP metapools. In addition to this, with the enactment of the Curve whitelist proposal, any veCrv Frax locks can be used for promoting Frax pools or metapools on the Curve gauge system.\n\n**Voting Incentives:**\n\nAlong with FXS allocation from treasury, Frax may also use a portion of cvxCRV farmed from the FraxBP for incentives on the Votium platform up to a maximum value of $10,000,000, as has been previously decided in a past governance proposal.\n\nFrax will continue to provide voting incentives for Frax pools. However, with the advent of the base pool, Frax can now also provide incentives to FraxBP metapools.\n\n**For Ethereum Mainnet:**\n\nMetapools may receive a share of incentives based on organic TVL of the FraxBP in each pool. A maximum of 20% of yield from the FraxBP protocol owned liquidity may be applied to each metapool and 50% of such yield applied to all metapools in total.\n\n(Note: Organic TVL, TVL not affected by incentives or gauge weight from Frax, is determined by the Frax Team.)\n\n**For non-Ethereum chain pools:**\n\nThe FraxBP for each chain may receive increased incentives based on the total TVL of FraxBP in all metapools on a given chain.\n\nNon-Ethereum chain metapools are structured differently on Curve's crosschain implementations and thus already automatically earn the base yield of the base pool gauge weight proportionally. This is something Ethereum mainnet metapools do not do because of gas costs. Thus we will attempt to mimic such a concept on mainnet by adding voting incentives to mainnet metapools. However, keeping Protocol Owned Liquidity at a healthy level is also important thus, at max, half of the incentives from FraxBP revenue may be applied to metapools.\n\n**Frax veCRV Gauge Weight:**\n\nThe Frax team will have discretion on how to effectively use veCRV gauge weight to promote Frax pools or metapools.\n\n## Voting\n\n**For:** Enact FraxBP farming and Frax pool voting incentive strategies described above.\n\n**Against:** Do nothing.",

      "title": " FIP 94 - Approve OHM-FRAX Fraxswap Gauge",
      "content": "### **Summary:**\n\nAdd an OlympusDAO OHM-FRAX gauge on Fraxswap with Mint and Sync (M&S).\n\n### **Background & Motivation:**\n\nOlympusDAO is seeking to create a closer partnership with the Frax Finance community and ecosystem. Olympus had previously created deep liquidity with FRAX at a max depth of $17M, aided in Protocol-Owned Liquidity (POL) for Frax Finance through Olympus Pro (Total Bonded Value of +$5M) and current holds FRAX as Risk Free Value for the protocol ($33M in reserves). This partnership continued with a DAO swap ([OIP-53](https://forum.olympusdao.finance/d/506-oip-53-execute-dao-swap-with-frax-finance) Execute DAO Swap with Frax Finance 3) and the acceptance of Olympus being able to lock its FXS tokens ([FIP-38](https://gov.frax.finance/t/fip-38-whitelist-olympusdao-to-stake-vefxs/363) Whitelist OlympusDAO to Stake veFXS 4).\n\n*Note: FRAX currently represents approximately 10% of Market Value of the Treasury and is considered a core reserve asset.*\n\n[FIP-51](https://gov.frax.finance/t/fip-51-olympusdao-ohm-frax-uni-v3-gauge/854) was posted so that Olympus’ LP would be whitelisted as a gauge. The proposal received feedback from the community to change the proposed LP from OHM-FRAX to gOHM-FRAX. This was suggested to make it easier for third party liquidity providers to receive FXS rewards. Olympus would like to propose an alternative option that not only incentivizes third party liquidity but it also will be the first pool receiving [M&S](https://forum.olympusdao.finance/d/1172-oip-93-mint-and-sync/32). M&S approved pools receive rebases directly into the LP.\n\nOHM-FRAX with M&S on Fraxswap will be protected from emission dilution and allow for the ability for liquidity providers to receive FXS rewards. Olympus currently holds ~209k FXS and intends to vote on the gauge if approved. In the past 3 months gOHM has performed well against the market which suggests that an OHM-Stable pool with M&S should be an attractive LP. Therefore driving TVL and volume to Fraxswap as Olympus’ primary OHM-FRAX market. With passing governance approval Olympus will seed liquidity to kickstart the pool.\n\n### **Benefits of this Gauge:**\n\n1. Community-provided liquidity receives rebases directly into the pool\n2. Exposure to one of the best performing assets in the past 3 months\n3. Community liquidity providers are able to receive a portion of Olympus’ veFXS vote\n4. Fraxswap becomes Olympus’ primary FRAX market\n5. LP + M&S + veFXS voting will help to drive more volume and TVL to Fraxswap\n\n### Poll\n- For: Add gauge\n- Against: Do nothing",

      "content": "**Author**\nSam Kazemian\n\n### **Summary**\nDeploy a FRAX-SYN Fraxswap gauge to the gauge controller.\n\n### **Background and Motivation**\nSynapse Protocol is one of the emerging bridge projects that has had a good relationship with FRAX for quite some time. The team is professional, helpful, and has bridged synFRAX on multiple chains to date. Previously, FRAX did an Ondo.finance FRAX-SYN vault as a partnership between the two projects. On maturity, this vault had some bad debt on closing and thus Synapse paid in SYN per the terms of the Ondo.finance vault. Thus, FRAX protocol has a significant amount of SYN. We've been working in cooperation with the Synapse team to build positive value together so they can both repay their FRAX fixed term debt from the Ondo vault as well as get their SYN returned after FRAX denominated debt has been repaid. We've suggested that to build good liquidity onchain, we can propose a FRAX-SYN Fraxswap gauge to get FXS emissions toward this. \n\nThe Synapse team has also expressed a commitment to do SYN co-incentives for this gauge together. This helps both FRAX & Synapse in multiple ways: SYN gets deep stablecoin liquidity onchain, FRAX can deploy POL with the SYN that it currently has to earn SYN rewards, and both communities can LP to earn both FXS+SYN+fees. Additionally, the TWAMM functionality of Fraxswap can be used to slowly repay the FRAX debt over a reasonable period of time for Synapse Protocol, putting them on strong footing and creating a great partnership opportunity for both projects. \n\n\n\n### **PROPOSAL**\n\n- **For:** Deploy a FRAX-SYN Fraxswap gauge to the gauge controller.\n\n- **Against:** Do nothing",

      "content": "**Authors**\nSam Kazemian\nTravis Moore\n\n### **Summary**\nDeploy a FRAX-FPIS Fraxswap gauge to the gauge controller.\n\n### **Background and Motivation**\nAfter the launch of the FPI stablecoin and expansion of FPI staking venues on Curve+Convex+FXS gauges, it's important to roll out utility and yield for FPIS (the governance token of the FPI stablecoin). One of the first places to do this is to get FPIS LPs yield in the FXS gauge system. The FPI protocol itself can also bribe/incentivize veFXS voters with FPIS to increase the FRAX-FPIS gauge weight and get a profitable yield (as well as deploy POL itself potentially). Thus, we propose the next step in FPIS utility be a new gauge pair preceding the launch of veFPIS. \n\nIt's important to note that for FXS gauges, the trading pair must be FRAX-FPIS instead of FPI-FPIS. Once veFPIS and associated emissions are released publicly in the coming weeks, the community+team can propose creating FPI trading pairs as well where applicable. \n\n### **PROPOSAL**\n\n- **For:** Deploy a FRAX-FPIS Fraxswap gauge to the gauge controller.\n\n- **Against:** Do nothing",

      "title": "FIP 84 - FRAX <> Gamma Strategies",
      "content": "### **Summary**\n\nAdd the Gamma FPI-FRAX 0.05% Uniswap v3 pool to FRAX gauges on Optimism\n\n### **Background**\n\nGamma is an active liquidity manager and market-making platform that is currently building on Uniswap v3. It has been managing liquidity on Uniswap v3 since the launch of Uniswap v3 and has undergone multiple audits with the most recent one completed by ConsenSys Diligence. Currently, Gamma is managing over 50 pairs on Mainnet, 9 pairs on Polygon, and 5 pairs on Optimism.\n\n### **Motivation**\n\nThe main advantage of adding a Frax gauge for the FPI-FRAX Uniswap v3 pool is to increase market coverage and trade volume for FPI and FRAX on Optimism. Uniswap currently has the majority market share of all trading volume on Optimism (as of 6/21/2022). The capital efficiency and breadth of assets on Uniswap will allow for efficient trades from ETH, WBTC, and exotic assets to FPI and vice versa. This combined with Uniswap’s top-of-mind awareness amongst traders and LPs ultimately allows for greater exposure to FPI.\n\nThe advantage of using Gamma to manage the FPI-FRAX pool is that it will manage the range to more tightly maintaining the peg to the CPI-U as indicated here [Bureau of Labor Statistics Data ](https://data.bls.gov/timeseries/CUSR0000SA0)as well as generate profitable yield for LPs.\n\nUnlike prior gauges for Uniswap v3 FRAX-USDC and Uniswap v3 FRAX-DAI, the gauge for FPI-FRAX will likely require active management due to the slowly drifting peg of FPI. For example, the current Uniswap V3 FRAX/USDC position was easier to make a gauge for because one could simply specify the min and max price at 0.995 and 1.005 respectively without ever having to change the ranges for the position. Because FPI will increase against FRAX over time, some active management of the position will be necessary.\n\nGamma is currently managing the rETH-THETA / ETH pair for Ribbon Finance, which similarly deals with an increase in rETH-THETA price against ETH of around 0.3% per week. Our algorithm dynamically tracks the price per share of rETH-THETA and manages the liquidity to maintain peg to the Net Asset Value of rETH-THETA. Similarly, we will track the value of the CPI and automatically manage the liquidity ranges to maintain peg to the CPI-U.\n\nAn added benefit of having a manager is that we will also compound fees that are collected outside of the LP position back into the LP position, further increasing the liquidity for FPI-FRAX.\n\n### **FRAX/FPI Specs**\n\n* Fee Tier: 0.05%\n* Position ranges: Maintain a +/- 5 tick distance from the current price as indicated by the CPI-U\n  * Example if CPI-U price is 1 FRAX per FPI, then the lower range will be 0.9956 and the upper range will be 1.0056.\n\n### **Gamma Specs**\n\n* Gamma takes 10% of fees claimed to pay gas fees for rebalances\n* The position manager contract allows for limited admin functionality, namely with regards to rebalancing the position as the FPI drifts gradually upward. There are no functionality or admin rights to withdraw any liquidity.\n\nThe last audit was performed by blue-chip auditing firm, ConsenSys Diligence Audits on 3/28/2022. All audit details can be found here: [https://docs.gamma.xyz/gamma/learn/audits ](https://docs.gamma.xyz/gamma/learn/audits)\n\n### Poll\n- For: Add the Gamma FPI-FRAX 0.05% Uniswap v3 pool to FRAX gauges on Optimism\n- Against: Do nothing",

      "title": "FIP 77 - $20m FXS buyback program using TWAMM",
      "content": "**Authors**\nSam Kazemian\nTravis Moore\n\n### **Summary**\nPropose using 20m FRAX to buyback FXS using Fraxswap FRAX-FXS TWAMM pair over a period of minimum 3 days or up to 30+ days (exact period at core team's discretion).\n\n### **Background and Motivation**\nOver the past month, the crypto markets have indisputably become bearish and prices have dropped anywhere between 40-90% for most major tokens. However, FXS has been particularly hard hit. FRAX's peg is indisputably resilient, has never been in doubt, and has held perfectly since inception. The protocol as a whole has been in excellent shape. Thus, the core team does not believe the significantly worse performance of FXS compared to other tokens is justified any longer and feels confident to propose a large $20m FXS buyback using the TWAMM should the community+token holders approve. \n\nFRAX still makes over $80m annual revenue while FXS has dropped out of the top 100 Coingecko rankings. Thus, FXS seems to be the most undervalued out of all other volatile assets FRAX could hold on the balance sheet. At these prices, it is probable that using capital/profits to purchase FXS is the best use of capital dollar for dollar spent. It's important to highlight that this is not something that is often true. This is only the case when the community and core team believe that FXS is the most undervalued across all assets that the protocol can allocate capital to. For example, a $20m FXS buyback (and burn) at $4 FXS would retire 5% of the total supply of FXS. An incredible return of value to token holders at such prices. Such a scenario would effectively make the total supply of FXS less than 95m.\n\nBut at this time, we personally believe that to be the case. Thus, we are proposing this extensive buyback program. FRAX is strong and profitable enough to take advantage of the market irrationality on its governance token. While other protocols are liquidating volatile assets and their tokens for stablecoins, FRAX has a formidable warchest and cash flows that it can do the exact opposite and take advantage of this mispricing. \n\nShould the proposal pass, the FXS bought back can be burned entirely, placed in veFXS yield, or retained in the treasury until future governance allocates uses. This specific proposal is simply for the clearance to initiate this $20m TWAMM FXS buyback.\n\n### **PROPOSAL**\n\n#### **For:** Approve 20m FRAX to buyback FXS using Fraxswap TWAMM of 3 days or up to 30+ day period.\n\n#### **Against:** Do nothing",

      "title": "FIP 81 - Whitelist STAX Finance to stake FXS (Revised)",
      "content": "This is a revised proposal to FIP 53.\n\n\n## Summary:\n\nThis proposal is to whitelist STAX Finance in the Frax Finance VotingEscrow contract to allow STAX to lock FXS (in the form of veFXS), participate in FRAX governance, and provide additional rewards to Frax gauge ecosystem participants.The VeFXSProxy contract for STAX veFXS staking is deployed on mainnet: <0xdf291abc418b074cf7ec304c1608aa5346e4e10b>\n\nSTAX is a TempleDAO project.\n\n## Abstract\n\nSTAX is a protocol built on top of Frax Finance to provide enhanced farming yields via Locked Liquidity and veFXS boost to FRAX LP providers and FXS stakers through the social aggregation of $FXS deposits. It will also provide additional rewards to those Frax stakeholders via $STAX, the native utility token of STAX. We plan to distribute STAX platform fees to $STAX stakers.\n\nFor FXS Stakers, STAX provides a seamless onboarding process to veFXS by creating a tokenised wrapper token called staxFXS which will represent the veFXS locked for the maximum time in the VotingEscrow contract. The lock will be continually refreshed to prevent time decay on the veFXS boost to LP positions. The staxFXS token can be staked to receive existing rewards ($FXS) from Frax Finance, STAX platform revenues in the form of $staxFXS, and additional $STAX rewards. Though the staxFXS conversion is a one-way operation, users will be able to swap their $staxFXS back to $FXS at any time through a deep stable swap pool on Curve Finance.\n\nHaving a synergistic relationship with FXS holders is imperative to the success of STAX and to create a value-added relationship between the FRAX and STAX communities. FXS that is locked in STAX will be removed from circulation and will be continuously re-locked. By increasing demand for FXS we hope to drive utility and demand for the governance token of FRAX.\n\nFor Liquidity Providers, STAX provides a secondary yield aggregator interface to drive more deposits into the Frax gauge. STAX would allow depositors to achieve a high reward boost through the protocol-owned veFXS, and in some LPs the potential of Locked LP Boost while also benefiting from $STAX rewards.\n\nIf whitelisted for FXS staking, STAX Team will follow post-launch with veFXS boost and $STAX token rewards in August of 2022 after the liquidity generation event.\n\n## Brief Background & Motivation:\n\nTempleDAO (the engineering team behind STAX) was an early backer of Frax Finance by conducting its presale exclusively in FRAX, and became a top holder with one of the largest FRAX reserves ($137M). The current TVL in the FRAX/TEMPLE LP gauge is over $37M. We have been closely allied with the Frax ecosystem and a vast majority of our Treasury is held in FRAX-denominated assets. \n\nSince March, TempleDAO has spent over $600K at Pitch.money on veFXS holder bribes to further promote the Frax ecosystem and increase our FXS holdings. TEMPLE aspires to be the stable growth altcoin in a world of volatility by driving deep liquidity with blue-chip stablecoin pairs and utility for use as a lending collateral. Through STAX, which will bring liquidity to locked Frax gauge LP positions, we aim to facilitate deeper TEMPLE liquidity and TVL, and potentially expand to other LP pools.\n\n## Draft STAX Tokenomics\n\n10,000,000 tokens\n\n72% for user LP staking rewards / Pool 2 emissions initially to support:\n\n* STAX LP Pool\n* FRAX-TEMPLE Pool\n* Locked STAX\n\n14% STAX Treasury reserve\n\n6% Team\n\n3% Liquidity Generation Event Participants\n\n3% Initial liquidity\n\n2% Emissions to Temple Core vault stakers (over X months)\n\n## STAX Governance\n\nIf whitelisted for veFXS locking, the STAX Protocol would be expected to wield a significant percentage of the veFXS voting power over time. Because STAX would help direct the flow of FXS incentives in the FRAX ecosystem, it is of paramount importance that this economic power is fully decentralized.\n\nSTAX governance will be a further iteration of the TempleDAO representative governance model. The $STAX token is intended post-launch to have appropriate governance rights for the STAX platform. STAX voters will be able to direct the vote on the Frax gauge using the STAX protocol-owned veFXS voting power.\n\nAt launch, STAX would use its veFXS to vote for the FRAX/TEMPLE LP gauge. At this time, the STAX team is considering a second FRAX pool cross chain (not a FRAX gauge) that also has strategic ties to the FRAX and TEMPLE ecosystems.\n\nPost launch, the locked $STAX token will direct STAX emissions between these TEMPLE pools. Any expansion of STAX beyond the FRAX/TEMPLE pool into other FRAX gauges would be made through representative governance. This transition would take place after STAX voting contracts are battle-tested, and the STAX voter base has matured. At maturity, control of STAX will be passed from the starting 3 of 4 multisig Gnosis safe to a suite of on-chain contracts.\n\n## STAX Team\n\nThe STAX Team is comprised of TempleDAO builders who have a proven track record of delivering innovative DeFi products such as the Temple Defense which has successfully protected the intrinsic value backing of $TEMPLE through the recent downturn, and the TempleDAO Uni v2 custom AMM which has smoothly handled over $270M in FRAX/TEMPLE LP transaction volume while providing additional features such as minting and price floor defense.\n\n## STAX Contracts / Audits\n\nThe MVP version of STAX that we have just launched in June is a sneak preview of the full product that will be launched in a few months. The STAX v0.1 dApp currently contains a single gauge LP (FRAX/TEMPLE) and provides a user-friendly front-end for the AddLiquidity method for the Uni v2 LP contract currently deployed for the Temple custom AMM. You may read more about STAX v0.1 in our recent Medium article which can be found on our website below.\n\nThe full set of STAX contracts will be derived from the battle-tested Curve code base. We have scheduled an audit with Peckshield in July, which also performed an audit of the original TEMPLE contracts that were successfully deployed last year at our public launch.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn summary, STAX will support $FXS price by driving demand for $FXS and becoming a long-term protocol holder. STAX would accumulate $FXS to boost the FRAX/TEMPLE LP gauge, which continues to be a significant FRAX farm and a driver for locked FRAX liquidity. TempleDAO will be a long-term holder of FRAX, and a key participant in the FRAX bribe ecosystem.\n\nA vote for STAX Finance to gain veFXS whitelist is supportive of FRAX, FXS price, FRAX bribe ecosystem, TempleDAO, and the FRAX/TEMPLE gauge. A clear win for both communities.\n\n### Poll\n\nFor: Add STAX Finance to veFXS whitelist\n\nAgainst: Do nothing\n\n\n### Additional Information\n\nSTAX Team has compiled a list of responses to the very constructive questions and feedback from C2tP for an earlier draft of FIP 81:\n\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1o6KyEw9im4F_8t4X0VOamQXirKjzW8jfaECCp5iGLXE/edit?usp=sharing\n\nSTAX v0.1 Website: https://www.stax.fi/",

      "title": "FIP-85-Protocol Research Unit Grant Proposal",
      "content": "**Authors**\n\nHaym Salomon and DeFi Dave\n\n**Proposal**\n\nGrant $50,000 worth of FRAX and $25,000 worth of FXS to launch Protocol Research Unit with the goal of identifying and modeling Frax core Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), developing proof-of-concept dashboards and a business cycle process. This grant is for a trial period of ten weeks.\n\n**Background**\n\nFrax Finance launched in December 2020 with a lot of promise. In the short 1.5 years since launch, Frax has grown from an upstart stablecoin experiment to an increasingly influential pillar of DeFi. If/when FRAXBP passes, Frax Finance will become deeply intertwined with Curve Finance and Convex Finance, binding the three in a novel Protocol Triumvirate.\n\nSince genesis, the Frax team has (and will continue to) delivered around-the-clock efforts to develop world class technology and economic theory. DeFi is entering a critical juncture with the creation of FRAXBP, the loss of Terra, the lurking MEV issue, etc. The Frax core chain must continue pushing innovation on-chain.\n\nAs Frax matures into the full-fledged ecosystem it has been building towards its inception, it must accept the responsibility to clearly define, monitor and execute against data-driven KPIs. Because of this, Frax must formalize its own key success, risk and health indicators; not only provide the Frax core team more data to make better-informed decisions, but also to lead by example as a responsible steward of all of DeFi.\n\n**Summary**\n\nDeliverables:\n\nCredmark\nIdentification of no less than 4 and no more than 6 business metrics and\nDevelop mathematical models\nProduce proof of concept dashboards (eg PowerBI dashboards 9)\nDeliver comprehensive whitepapers\nHaym\nProposal for a regular business cycle\nAll the research and tooling will be persistent, open source, and adjustable by the Frax community.\n\n**Team/People**\n\nProject Lead - Haym Salomon 2. Contributor to Umami Finance and Dopex in the past and has written a number of Twitter threads pertaining to Frax and the wider DeFi landscape.\n\nAdvisors - DeFi Dave 2. First-follower and missionary of Frax. Current Co-Founder of PIF Labs. Previously led growth for Gelato and wrote numerous articles for The Defiant.\n\nAnalytics Development - Credmark 4 is a full stack DeFi financial modeling platform. The Credmark team has published numerous research reports (eg: Terra Ecosystem Postmortem) and provides the risk analysis technology for Debt DAO. Frax sample work: Frax/FXS/FPIS distribution and inflows/outflows 9\n\n**Funding**\n\nKPI identification and Development\nCredmark has estimated a budget of $10k per KPI.\nBudget: $50k of FRAX\nDesign and creative development\nBudget: $5k of FXS\nBuffer/Unanticipated cost overruns\nBudget: $10k of FXS\nThe project will provide a full accounting and will return any unspent funds to the Frax Finance treasury.\n\nRequests in this proposal take into account funding from previous grants (for community websites and dashboards) Those who are currently being funded by those grants will not be eligible for rewards.\n\n**Timeline**\n\nDeliverables will be interactively produced throughout the ten week period as individual items are complete.\n\nIt is anticipated that the first week will be used to set up operations and the next nine weeks will be used to execute. When we seek renewal when the period ends, we will have a better idea of the associated costs of our efforts.\n\n**Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)**\n\nThe primary purpose of this proposal is to rigorously define and document the most important KPIs for Frax Finance. We will limit our findings to include no more than 6 primary KPIs.\n\nInitial starting ideas:\n\nFrax Finance\n\nveFXS locked %\nProtocol Controlled Liquidity (POL)\nFinancial Performance\n\nEBITDA, revenue and costs\nAssets under management\nCost of capital\nDeFi Dominance\n\nStablecoin dominance\nDEX dominance (Fraxswap), lending dominance (Fraxlend), staking dominance\nCentralization\n\nDecentralization Ratio\nCounterparty exposures and measures\nWhale exposures and activity\n\n**Motivation**\n\nIn May 2022, DeFi and crypto were rocked when UST broke its peg and the TerraLuna ecosystem collapsed. In the aftermath, regulators, TradFi and the general public immediately began asking questions and demanding for action to be taken. As regulation begins to take shape, it has become more and more clear that Frax Finance does not have (and is not prepared for) a seat at the table at those levels.\n\nOn the heels of the collapse of TerraLuna, community members such as 0xHamz (@0xHamz on Twitter) have discussed large-scale real world opportunities. This correctly identifies a huge opportunity for scaling both Frax as an organization but also (given Frax’s role and the nature of FRAX) DeFi in general.\n\nAs Frax Finance grows in both on-chain scale and DAO contributors, it becomes more and more critical to clearly define success and organize the DAO, investors and the crypto community around simple and transparent metrics.\n\nThe first step in order to address both impending risks and RWA opportunities is to formalize organizational structure, metric and processes. The Protocol Research Unit will engage in a holistic and a financial review of the Frax protocol to define and begin tracking these metrics.\n\nUsing these KPIs and reporting as a basis, Frax will be able to provide clear, concise and reliable information to Frax operations, investors and media creators alike. Upon successful completion of the trial period, we intend to submit proposals better focusing on each of these three key stakeholders.\n\n**Proposal**\n\nGrant $75,000 FXS/FRAX to establish Protocol Research Unit\nDo Nothing",

System 9 is the dedicated market market for more than 80 alt-coins as the dedicated market maker and was founded by market makers from the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, JP Morgan Capital, and Bear Stearns. Our protocol is open source here:\n\ngithub.com\nGitHub - system9development/compound-protocol at feat/borrower-whitelist\nfeat/borrower-whitelist\n\nThe Compound On-Chain Protocol. Contribute to system9development/compound-protocol development by creating an account on GitHub.\n\n**Background and Motivation**\n\ndAMM is the first under-collateralized lending platform for any token, offering DAO’s and token issuers the ability to lend their assets directly to market makers seeking to provide liquidity in their respective markets. A core stablecoin is necessary for the dAMM protocol, and when examining the current stablecoin landscape, FRAX stood out as the clear favorite amongst the dAMM team for a number of reasons. FRAX pioneered the AMO primitive which has fostered mutually-beneficial relationships with partner protocolsFor this reason, we believe that a FRAX AMO to seed stablecoin liquidity to dAMM is a clear value add for both protocols; as well as establishing FRAX as the native stablecoin of dAMM.\n\n**dAMM AMO Goals:**\n\nFor this AMO, our goal is to provide FRAX with an organic and sustainable stream of revenue from lending to dAMM borrowers, as well as ownership over the dAMM protocol through a retro-active airdrop to DAOs and token issuer’s that are allocating to dAMM based on their allocation size.\n\nInterest payments on dAMM are paid out in the native token of the pool (FRAX in the FRAX pool, FXS in the FXS pool, etc).\n\n10% of all borrower interest payments on the protocol are passed directly to gdAMM (staked dAMM) holders in stablecoin rewards. If this partnership is accepted between dAMM and FRAX through this AMO, those rewards would be paid out in FRAX; making FRAX the native reward asset of dAMM staking.\n\n**Risk Mitigation of dAMM:**\n\nTo mitigate default risk, the dAMM Foundation requires all market makers borrowing from the protocol to sign a master loan agreement, and provide monthly audited financial statements for our credit risk team’s due diligence. The total amount a market maker can borrow is capped as a percentage of their balance sheet as determined by the jurisdiction and licenses of the borrower. All borrowers on the protocol are also required to stake a portion of their loan value in the form of dAMM as well.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\ndAMM is the first protocol for any token to be borrowed under-collateralized by institutional borrowers. Our intention as well regardless of the proposal’s success is to list all four native FRAX assets (FRAX, FXS, FPI, FPIS) for institutional borrowers. We also seek to list more than 200 tokens in the first year of the protocol being live.\n\nOur long term goal with this AMO is to create a mutually beneficial partnership between our protocols and generate revenue for the FRAX ecosystem, as well as put FRAX in the hands of reputable market makers and institutional borrowers.\nWe’re incredibly excited to partner with FRAX!\n\n**Proposal:**\nFor: Create the dAMM AMO and authorize up to $10mm of FRAX for use in the AMO.\n\nAgainst: Do nothing",

      "content": "**Author**\nGeorge Beall\n\n**Summary**\nThe purpose of this proposal is to adopt Commonwealth as the governance forum and voting interface for the Frax community. Commonwealth offers a fully crypto-native forum, voting interface (polls, Snapshot, and on-chain governance), and chat all in one product. Commonwealth is free to use and will soon be fully-decentralized.\n\n**Details**\nAbout Commonwealth\nCommonwealth is an all-in-one platform for decentralized communities to run themselves. We eliminate the need for multiple governance products / DAO tools. We offer fully crypto native discussion, chat, polling, onchain governance, Snapshot support, and member analytics / profiles. We power over 700+ DAOs including dYdX, Redacted Cartel, Axie Infinity, Osmosis, Stargate, Element Finance, Spiritswap, and soon Olympus. Commonwealth has raised $23.2M from Dragonfly, Parafi, Polychain, Framework, Hashed, Nascent, Spark, Balaji, Stani, and others.\n\n**Goal**\nTo migrate the current Frax forum to Commonwealth and integrate your Snapshot / governance.\n\n**The Problem**\nCurrently the Frax governance community is highly fragmented (Telegram, Discord, Discourse, Snapshot, on-chain voting) and has little transparency into the discussion / voting activity.\n\nCreate a new account for Discourse with an email (non-sybil resistant, non-spam resistant)\nCreate other web2 accounts (Telegram, Discord)\nMissing the link between forum discussions, chat, and voting\nNeed to now use 3-5 platforms for every DAO a member is a part of\nThe Solution\nIntegrating Commonwealth is incredibly easy, the user journey would look like this:\n\nImport the Frax Discourse to Commonwealth (maintains all content and profiles)\nLink Frax governance and Snapshot (creates bidirectional governance interfaces)\nCommunity owned and run\nFor users, using Commonwealth is simple:\n\nLink your wallet via Metamask or Wallet Connect\nJoin the Frax forum\nLink the same email you used for Discourse to claim your old account\nBegin discussing, chatting, creating proposals, and voting in one space for all of your communities\nBenefits to the Frax Community\nTo summarize, below are the key benefits for the end users:\n\nSimplified user journey to interact with the Frax community\nTotally free to use\nFully crypto native experience\nIn-app crowdfunding (soon)\nDAO tool app store (soon)\nTeam\nDillon Chen - Founder / CEO - prev.

      "title": "FIP-87- Centrifuge <> Frax AMO",
      "content": "**Author**\nMike Ruzic\n\n**Summary**\nCreate a Centrifuge AMO to provide liquidity across our Senior pools.\n\n**About Centrifuge**\nCentrifuge is a pioneering project that connects real-world assets (RWAs) to DeFi offering a fully transparent protocol which allows borrowers and lenders to transact without unnecessary intermediaries. Ultimately, the protocol aims to lower the cost of borrowing for businesses around the world, while providing users with a stable source of collateralized yield that is uncorrelated to the volatile crypto markets. Centrifuge was the first DeFi protocol to bridge RWAs on-chain and has integrated with some of the leading protocols, including MakerDAO and Aave.\n\nCentrifuge asset pools are fully collateralized by underlying RWAs and investors have legal rights to the collateral in the case of a default. This makes Centrifuge unique versus many of our RWA peers that largely focus on undercollateralized lending. NFTs are used as digital representations of the RWAs on-chain, allowing investors to have full visibility on the exact collateral they finance. The protocol is asset class agnostic and has created pools for assets such as mortgages, invoices and consumer finance. Centrifuge on-chain stats can be found here 4. Key metrics:\n\n$85M TVL\n$125M+ in net assets financed\n100s of underlying assets financed\nCentrifuge dapp (Tinlake) overview\nIssuers use Tinlake to access capital, which in turn is used to finance real-world businesses. Assets are posted as collateral (visible on-chain) and users are able to generate yield according to their risk appetite. Much like many traditional asset finance transactions, Tinlake pools are divided into two tranches (senior and junior). These tranches are used to offer investors differing risk/reward profiles.\n\nSenior tranche (DROP): The senior tranche is the largest tranche and is structured to have a stable fixed return. It is insulated from losses by the riskier junior tranche, which in the case of default will absorb any losses before the senior tranche is affected. This is a lower risk offering that is designed as a fixed income product.\nJunior tranche (TIN): The junior tranche is a smaller percentage of the overall pool and is structured to offer investors a variable return. The junior tranche will capture the residual cash flows in the pool after the senior investors have been fully paid back. As mentioned above, this means that any losses will first be attributed to this riskier tranche. The junior tranche is designed to potentially offer higher returns, but is volatile in nature.\nSee our docs for a deeper understanding of how our dapp Tinlake works.\n\n**Returns**\nSenior (DROP): returns vary according to the asset class and the corresponding risk of the underlying assets being financed. Current live opportunities on Tinlake have an APY between 3.5 - 10%.\n\nJunior (TIN): returns are riskier and highly variable. Current live opportunities on Tinlake have an APY between 15 - 50%+.\n\n**Liquidity**\nCentrifuge offers revolving pools. Revolving pools mean users can invest/redeem at any time they wish. A decentralized solver mechanism matches investments and redemptions with the available liquidity in the pool, allowing users to move in and out of the pool if/when liquidity is available. This brings liquidity to a traditionally illiquid asset class.\n\nInvestor Protection & Legal Framework\nOur top priority is investor protection. As a result, we created a template legal structure that is unique in the DeFi ecosystem and gives users protection should a pool go into default. As is seen in traditional financial structures, users sign agreements that give them legal recourse to the underlying assets used as collateral in the pool.\n\nRead more about our template legal structure here 6.\n\n**Motivation**\nFrax is one of the most advanced and promising stablecoins in the Web3 ecosystem. As FRAX looks to diversify their collateral base the community has been forward looking in using RWAs to do so. RWAs offer FRAX a unique source of yield that is uncorrelated to the broader crypto ecosystem, while offering the necessary stability to underpin long-term growth. Centrifuge offers FRAX the opportunity to participate in a wide range of asset classes that can truly diversify the FRAX collateral base. It also offers FRAX the opportunity to proliferate outside the crypto ecosystem and impact the lives and livelihoods of many people around the globe.\n\nFrom the Centrifuge side we are keen to work with what we view as the fastest growing stablecoin in the ecosystem. FRAX has proven it can scale and we therefore view FRAX as a long-term sustainable source of capital that can help shape the RWA dream. We would be excited to welcome such a partner to the Centrifuge community and very much look forward to the potential collaboration.\n\n**Proposal**\n-Create a Centrifuge AMO and authorize up to $100M worth of liquidity for use in the AMO.\n\n-Do Nothing",

      "content": "**Authors**\nFrax Core Team\n\n### **Summary**\nAllocate 1.2m FRAX to the core treasury for use on quarterly security audits. \n\n### **Background and Motivation**\nFRAX has had impeccable security to date in its 17 months being live. We have had 0 critical vulnerabilities where the protocol or any user has lost funds to a vulnerability/bug. This is because the core team takes security extremely seriously and has recurring audits scheduled with some of the top firms in the industry such as Trail of Bits. All of the protocol audits are published in our documentation as they become available:\nhttps://docs.frax.finance/other/audits\n\nThese audits typically take 2-4 weeks depending on amount of engineers involved and go through protocol code extensively. We would like to allocate 1.2m FRAX to pay for annual security budget and recurring, quarterly audits by top firms. It is likely that the total amount will not be used over 12 months which will roll over to the next 12 month period. In the event that the budget is used in under 12 months due to the size of FRAX's core protocol contracts+code, we will propose a new budget allocation so that governance must approve it. \n\nSeeing as how security and top audits are one of, if not most, important aspects of building a reputable and great defi protocol, we assume this will be an easy pass. For comparison, this is the annual budget for all security related audits+expenses which is less than ~5 days of protocol revenue. This small expenditure is one of the most important expenses of any defi project. \n\n### **PROPOSAL**\n\n**For:** Approve 1.2m FRAX to core treasury for security audits+pentesting\n\n**Against:** Do nothing",

      "content": "**Author(s)**\n\nDeFi Dave\n\n**Proposal**\n\nGrant $18,000 worth of FXS and FRAX (split 50/50) for a 3 month period for funding a Frax-centric media effort that covers protocol developments as well as interviews prominent players within the ecosystem.\n\n**Background**\n\nWe propose that the Frax DAO take the first step in increasing awareness of the Frax protocol in order to better educate the wider community, clear and more effectively proliferate narratives to the wider crypto space. This proposal will help fund:\n\n-Flywheel, a Frax-focused podcast dedicated to interviewing and shining a light on members of the Frax community including core team devs, outside contributors, large stakeholders, and everyone in between.\n-A weekly Twitter space, the Frax Town Square, dedicated to discussing Frax governance proposals and hosting authors of those proposals to make their case to the community.\n-Fraxcast, a weekly news roundup of everything happening in the ecosystem including stats, developments, partnerships, etc.\n\nCosts associated with each episode will cover subscription expenses and labor hours spent prepping, recording, editing, and distributing content.\n\nThe people behind this initiative include:\n\n-Sam McCulloch (@ssmccul 1) who is a long-time member of the Frax community and has had a podcast of his own. Sam will be the lead and producer for the unit and will act as producer to both shows as well as co-host the Frax Town Square.\n-DeFi Dave (@davesaidthat_ 1) who is a Day Zero Fraximalist and has hosted a podcast in the past, The DeFi Scoop. He will co-host both Flywheel and Frax Town Square.\n-kapital_k (0xkapital_k 1) who is a DeFi/Gaming/Tokenomics enthusiast and Frax supporter who has researched the protocol deeply.\n\n**Motivation**\n\nIt has become common practice for platforms and protocols to have their own media initiatives to keep members of their community informed and engaged. Protocols that have had podcasts in the past include Olympus DAO, Redacted, and others. These niche podcasts play an important role by providing color to what is happening at the bleeding edges of financial innovation in each of their respected corners of DeFi. In the Frax ecosystem alone, their are numerous developments happening that it is hard to keep track of all the progress.\n\nSam Kazemian has done an excellent job championing the Frax ecosystem by going on countless podcasts, spaces, and everything in between over the past few years. Yet, the Frax ecosystem is growing to become much bigger than Sam and the core team alone. Numerous contributors and commentators have arisen that can and will continue to advance the Frax forward into the future.\n\n**Proposal**\n\n-Grant $18,000 worth of FXS and FRAX to fund media activities\n-Do Nothing",

      "title": "FIP 79 - Unlock+Move FRAX-FXS LP to gauges",
      "content": "**Authors**\nSam Kazemian\nDennis @Denett \n\n### **Summary**\nUnlock the FRAX-FXS Uni v2 LP pool to deprecate its FXS rewards and deploy a FRAX-FXS Fraxswap gauge.\n\n### **Background and Motivation**\nThe FRAX-FXS Uni v2 LP token is the oldest FRAX farm started at genesis on December 20, 2020. Other than the 12,500 FXS emitted per day across all gauges, ~8400 FXS is emitted through this single FRAX-FXS LP pair which accounts for nearly 40% of all FXS emissions. \n\nBy deprecating this pair and moving FRAX-FXS LPs to Fraxswap under the gauge system, FXS immediately becomes 40% more scarce as the amount emitted per day drops from 12,500+8400=20,900 to just 12,500 across the entire protocol. This is an important step in making the protocol more profitable, capital efficient, and overall consolidating all FXS emissions into the elegant gauge system. \n\nThe only potential reason to vote against this proposal is the danger of ~66% of the FRAX-FXS LP locked liquidity being set free. This means about 20m FRAX and 3.6m FXS would be unlocked and able to be sold immediately on deprecation of this pair. It's important to consider the absolute worst case scenario that 100% of all unlocked liquidity is sold to exit the protocol. When we considered this, we concluded that 20m FRAX sold into Curve/Uniswap is immaterial and completely manageable with no danger to the peg. Selling 3.6m FXS could materially impact FXS price since most of the liquidity would be gone. However, this is mitigated by the protocol deploying FRAX-FXS POL into Fraxswap which it currently already has to the tune of $13m liquidity. The protocol could increase its POL in Fraxswap up to $50m to make the liquidity depth comparable to the FRAX-FXS Uniswap v2 pool. Additionally, the high yield opportunities in veFXS, cvxFXS, as well as the FRAX-FXS gauge that will come with this proposal will immediately give unlocked LPs a lucrative place to continue to earn yield and continue to support the protocol. We believe a sizable portion of early supporters and LPs will move over to the other lucrative staking opportunities for FRAX and FXS rather than exit. Nevertheless, even under the worst mathematical scenario that 100% of unlocked LPs sell both FRAX and FXS, we've shown the material impact is nothing to the peg and minimal to FXS price (as long as the protocol increases its FRAX-FXS POL on Fraxswap). In fact, we anticipate this could have a profoundly positive impact+sentiment on FXS price in the short to medium term as a large source of FXS emission is permanently cut from the market.\n\nOverall, we analyzed that this is an incredibly lucrative opportunity for the protocol to cut down 40% of its inflation, make FXS more scarce, add a new gauge, and make use of its ability to deploy FRAX-FXS POL to create a lot of value.\n\n### **PROPOSAL**\n\n##### **For:** Unlock FRAX-FXS Uni v2 LP & discontinue its FXS rewards. Deploy FRAX-FXS Fraxswap LP gauge.\n\n##### **Against:** Do nothing\n\n### AMENDMENT 6/12/22\nFRAX-FXS Gauge for this proposal should have a 1 year lock with 3x boost instead of the 3 year lock for 3x boost. This is because we've analyzed that we can get a higher amount of liquidity in each gauge and maximize the locking mechanism if we lower the max lock time to 1 year. Thus, gauge proposals will be for deployment of 1 year lock style unless otherwise specified.",

      "title": "FIP 76 - Allocate a portion of CRV farmed to create a staked cvxCRV holdings",
      "content": "Author:\nC2tP (Convex Finance)\n\n### Summary:\nDeposit 20-40% of protocol wide farmed CRV into cvxCRV and stake to create more revenue/cash flow for the protocol via CRV emissions and Curve fees (3pool stablecoins), as well as more CVX emissions for Frax to lock. CRV will be deposited directly into cvxCrv if the market discount is lower or equal to 3% and can be swapped if higher.  The deposit amount will be decided by the Frax team based on market conditions at the time of deposit as long as it is in the defined 20-40% range.\n\n\n### Related Readings:\nPlease read the Curve proposal and future roadmap laid out by Sam at (https://gov.curve.fi/t/deploy-a-fraxbp-pool-whitelist-frax-for-vecrv-staking/3958)\n\n\n### Details:\nI have been in discussion with Sam for many months now about how Frax could use their farmed rewards more efficiently.  At face value there is a big decision of lower immediate profits vs long term sustainability.  With the advance of a few key points, we think we have found a good solution on what can be done.  This will be a multi step procedure involving multiple proposals on both Frax and Curve.  This proposal is the first step.\n\nCurrently CRV farmed by POL are being sold and returned to veFXS holders as revenue.  This proposal will allocate a portion of that CRV to create another revenue stream that will compound farming rewards.  This gives Frax not only continued crv/cvx rewards but also gives the platform a revenue stream in stable coins. This will provide a nicer balance and stability to revenue which is less volatile than governance token farming. The current APR as of this writing is 52.7%, of which 32.4% is in stablecoins via Curve admin fees. While recent turbulent times have had a negative effect on CRV prices, trading fees have increased dramatically.  This should clearly show that it should be a priority for Frax to have more revenue streams denominated in different token types.\n\nUntil Curve whitelist is passed and frax3crv is deprecated for its fraxbp replacement, the Frax team can use cvxCrv as incentives on Votium. Their goal and mandate should be to try to stock pile cvxCrv but also use what's necessary to keep proper liquidity incentives. This balance is decided by the team.\n\n### Merits:\n- Compoundable CRV\n- More CVX rewards to increase Frax's CVX position.\n- Stablecoin revenue stream\n- More vecrv power to Frax's CVX holdings.\n\n\n### Future Plans:\nThis proposal is for stockpiling cvxCRV as a revenue stream.  In a future proposal, we will lay out a system in which frax can use this cvxCRV in a way that will capture more gauge weight and increase Frax liquidity.  This is the first step and follows closely with the Curve proposal posted by Sam, as well as the future release of Fraxlend.\n\n\n### Voting Options:\n\nFor: Deposit 20-40% of protocol farmed CRV into cvxCRV and stake for rewards\n\nAgainst: Do nothing",

      "content": "### **Purpose**\n\nThis proposal's purpose is to approve the funding of $100K FRAX into an unbalanced FRAX/arUSD liquidity pool in partnership with Arable Protocol. In partnership with this approval, the Arable Protocol will provide arUSD liquidity to complete the pool and enable FRAX and FPIS as collateral, enabling FRAX/FPIS holders the ability to mint arUSD.\n\n### **Summary**\n\nArable Protocol proposes:\n\n- The creation and funding of an unbalanced FRAX/arUSD pool based on Arable’s swap contract.\n- To integrate FRAX and FPIS assets as supported collateral at Arable Protocol.\n\n\n### **Background**\n\nArable Protocol is reshaping the DeFi space. Our goal is to make multi-chain farming simple, economical, and available to all. With a simple yet powerful user interface, both experienced and new farmers can effortlessly stake yield farms from various chains. Arable allows for multi-chain yield farming on a single platform and chain without leaving the App. With ever-rising gas prices and bridging fees reducing revenues, it's time for a revolution!\n\nArable Protocol is based around a synthetic ecosystem and its liquidity is created through the minting of the stable asset arUSD. Utilizing arUSD, users can swap between a variety of synthetic cryptocurrencies and LP tokens and farm on synthetic yield farms that track the APR of their native chain counterparts. Collateral is required to back minted arUSD in an over-collateralized fashion. We propose to add FRAX and FPIS as collateral options to Arable’s current collateral options, including USDT, WAVAX, and Arable’s own governance token, ACRE. To find out more, please refer to [https://medium.com/@ArableProtocol/35e2c39a0c87](https://medium.com/@ArableProtocol/today-we-will-have-a-closer-look-at-the-role-of-minters-at-arable-35e2c39a0c87).\n\nTo incentivize the utilization of FRAX as collateral, we propose the creation and funding of an unbalanced (no slippage or impermanent loss) FRAX/arUSD pool based on Arable’s swap contract. The Frax protocol will add a one-sided deposit of $100k FRAX, which will be matched with $100k arUSD by the Arable Protocol for a total liquidity of $200k.\n\n### **Rationale**\n\n1. **Increasing volume and liquidity for both protocols.** By supporting FRAX and FPIS as additional collateral options by Arable Protocol and the creation of a FRAX/arUSD liquidity pool, such a partnership would result in increased liquidity for and visibility of our respective protocols.\n2. **Arable Protocol and the Frax Finance community have strongly aligned interests** and will benefit from more exposure to each other's communities.\n3. **Exploration of further co-marketing opportunities** will lead to increased visibility of each other’s communities and user bases.\n4. **Building trust through partnership.** By developing a long-term partnership, we can build trust with each other by ensuring fair and level compensation between the two protocols.\n\n### Poll\n- For: Allocate $100K FRAX into FRAX/arUSD liquidity pool\n- Against: Do nothing ",

      "content": "### Summary\n\nThe purpose of this proposal is to integrate Transak´s fiat on-ramp service on app.frax.finance in order to allow users to buy FRAX and other tokens directly from the dApp using credit/debit cards, bank transfers, Apple Pay, Google Pay and other local payment methods in more than 125+countries.\n\n### Details\n\n#### About Transak\n\nTransak is a single integration for applications to enable fiat-to-crypto on-ramp for a global user base. It does this by providing API-driven fiat payment methods to the on-ramp to 100+ crypto assets and abstracting away the complexity of user KYC, risk monitoring & compliance, payment methods, and customer support. Transak is already supported in tier 1 exchanges and wallets such as Beefy finance, Aave, Metamask, Trustwallet, Ledger, and hundreds of leading crypto projects.\n\n#### Goal\n\nTo integrate the Transak widget into app.frax.finance UI so that users can buy FRAX and other tokens across all supported chains using any of the supported fiat currencies through their preferred payment methods.\n\n#### The Problem\n\nUnfortunately, to start for example staking or yield farming on frax.finance, users have to obtain their cryptocurrencies beforehand in order to interact with the protocol. A user would have to go through as many as three steps before reaching their end goal:\n\n1. Deposit fiat into a centralised exchange\n2. Buy ETH and withdraw to your non-custodial wallet\n3. Connect to a DEX like Uniswap to get your FRAX tokens\n4. Finally connect to app.frax.finance and start your DeFi adventure\n\n#### The Solution\n\nBy integrating Transak, the user journey would look like this:\n\n1. Buy FRAX with fiat directly from app.frax.finance\n2. Start your DeFi journey\n\n#### Benefits to the Frax Community\n\nTo summarise, below are the key benefits for the end users:\n\n* Simplified user journey to buy with fiat using your preferred payment method\n* Support for over 120+ countries with fees as low as 0.99%\n* FRAX will also be available to purchase on transak.com and other Transak partners (Metamask, Ledger, etc..), increasing visibility to and brand recognition\n* Benefit from Transak’s experimental features like [1-click to protocol](https://transak.notion.site/1-click-to-protocol-on-ramp-69b5418b244a4e4bb1c3cf4ce1f43d65) where users can buy and stake with fiat in a single transaction.\n\n### How it works\n\nUsing this integration, the user clicks on the “buy with fiat” button on the FRAX DApp to launch the Transak Widget. You will be prompted to the widget where you select your preferred currency and the amount, your preferred payment method and the token to purchase. You then paste your wallet address and complete the transaction. Transak abstracts all the complexity of the payment flow and makes it simple for the user — Fiat in Crypto out.\n\n![|602x293](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard11/uploads/frax1/original/1X/b51d644c293e86b244dd759f967ee0737b1f2b82.jpeg)\n\n### Poll\n- For:  Add Transak´s fiat on-ramp service on Frax\n- Against: Do nothing\n\n#### Resources\n\nTransak[ Twitter](https://mobile.twitter.com/transak_)\n\nTransak[ Telegram](https://t.me/transakfinance)\n\nTransak[ Website](https://transak.com/)\n\nTransak [Docs](https://transak.gitbook.io/transak-docs/)",

      "title": "FIP - 73 - Use part of our farmed CRV to vote for our pools through the Stake DAO CRV liquid locker",
      "content": "### **Summary:**\n\nStop selling 100% of our farmed CRV and start using part of them to gain voting power on Curve through the Stake DAO CRV Liquid Locker, to maximize the efficiency of our strategy to maximize Frax liquidity and its domination in the algorithmic stable coin ecosystem.\n\n### **Context:**\n\nWith $1.8 billion deposited on Curve via AMOs, Frax is one of the largest CRV farmers in the ecosystem. However, since we were not allowed to obtain a whitelist on Curve's governance to have the possibility of locking those CRV and voting on Curve, we were forced to sell them. Today, we have the possibility of voting on Curve with those CRV via Stake DAO’s new whitelist-as-a-service offer.\n\nStakeDAO, (with which we already have partnerships on different fronts), recently released a \"Whitelist-as-a-Service\" offer, an alternative solution of liquid form for veMODEL tokenomics. They have already released a liquid locker for $ANGLE, $FXS and $CRV (https://lockers.stakedao.org/). They also just passed a vote to have a gauge for their different sdTKN/TKN pools on Curve.\n\n*How do liquid lockers work ? (example for $CRV)*\n\nThe liquid locker has a Curve whitelist, a reward contract, and a Curve Factory Pool. The $CRV staked in the liquid locker are locked for 4 years and perpetually relocked.\n\nThis locking allows maximized voting power and rewards.Whenever a governance proposal is listed on Curve’s governance, it is automatically reflected in the sdCRV snapshot, and every other week, a gauge vote is published on this Snapshot. sdCRV stakers can then vote for their preferred pools or governance choices, and those votes will be reflected directly in Curve’s governance.\n\nThey also mentioned they were targeting to make these lockers cross-chain, which could be interesting for the $CRV we farm on other chains in the future.\n\n$sdCRV holders will be allowed to stake in them on StakeDAO to receive:\n\n* Native APR (rewards in 3crv)\n* Share of 8% of all the corresponding strat rewards (rewards in $CRV)\n* The ability to vote or sell their voting rights from their $sdCRV\n* Additional SDT incentives (rewards in $SDT)\n\n#### Recap:\n\n![|624x351](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard11/uploads/frax1/original/1X/ab6d2f91da89542db82ddd350c765d09128dccc8.jpeg)\n\n### **Rationale:**\n\nThe goal of this proposal is to start using part of our farmed $CRV to gain a better edge in the Curve lobbying ecosystem. Part of our farmed CRV could be locked in the $CRV liquid lockers created by Stake DAO and would have a voting power even without having a whitelist directly on Curve. Furthermore, as Frax already owns some SDT, we will benefit from a boost on our rewards and CRV voting power.\n\nBy using Stake DAO’s CRV liquid locker, our CRV would be put to work and we would benefit from:\n\n* veCRV trading fees in 3CRV (as if we were locking CRV for 4 years)\n* Additional yield paid in CRV (platform fees coming from boost mutualisation)\n* SDT incentives, which would allow us to boost our yield and voting power if locked on Stake DAO\n* Liquidity (possibility to exit whenever we want through a pool on Curve. Liquidity TBC)\n\n* And the most important: voting rights on Curve to boost our pools or pass governance proposals. We could even boost our voting rights up to 2x by holding veSDT (cf [this medium](https://stakedaohq.medium.com/introducing-liquid-lockers-vesdt-5febcf169170)). We could use the 3CRV farmed to increase the liquidity of FRAX, use the CRV farmed to increase again the yields and create a voting flywheel offor our pools via voting on Curve;, finally and lock the SDT to boost our yield and voting power on Curve.\n\nBuilding an $sdCRV position would allow Frax to gain more voting power over Curve's governance, thus boosting $CRV rewards for our pools. Furthermore, with the reduced selling pressure on $CRV, they APY should structurally go up, increasing the DAO’s revenue and attractivity of our pools.\n\nAs the $veCRV will be cross-chain and cross-chain gauges are already a reality via Multichain any calls, if Frax decides to launch cross-chain AMOs, it may be possible to stake the $sdCRV directly on the chain where the $CRV is farmed.\n\n### Technical implementation:\n\nNo technical development needed.\n\n### Voting Options:\n\n* Yes, allow depositing a portion of our farmed CRV into Stake DAO liquid lockers\n* No, do nothing\n* Abstain",

      "content": "Author: Mark11 - Fraximalist community member \n\nRevised proposal - this proposal has been revised to remove discussion about liquidity assistance or migration to a Fraxswap pool until a further vote. This proposal will only deal with the unlocking of current LPs and the transfer of the current FRAX-IQ pool to the Frax gauge system program.\n\n### **Summary**\n\nThis proposal, if passed, would move the FRAX-IQ FXS rewards pool to Fraxswap and the FXS gauge reward system. The current FXS emissions directed to FRAX-IQ are to be ceased and retained in the treasury. \n\n### **Background**\n\nCurrently, we are spending about $8mm a year in FXS on rewards for the FRAX-IQ pool which has a TVL of $5.6mm. The FRAX-IQ pool is an outlier in that its rewards are not set by the gauges - I propose that we change that.\n\n**![|624x208](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard11/uploads/frax1/original/1X/acd2891e839c0e3877d66f3a55c26ed5d9fc553e.png)**\n\nWhile we are very close to the Everipedia community, I think it is time we reassessed whether the current arrangement serves either community very well - as it appears to create inefficient dilution to FXS holders and does not allow Everipedia to use its IQ token to bribe in the gauge system.\n\nFor example, it would be far more beneficial for FXS holders if we bonded FRAX-IQ in through Olympus Pro for FXS - at the end of a year instead of paying out $8mm in FXS for temporary liquidity of $2.8mm in FRAX we would own $8mm worth of FRAX-IQ liquidity.\n\nEveripedia themselves have been using Olympus Pro to build up their own liquidity - pulling in $1.4mm on ETH mainnet and $250K on Arbitrum.\n\n![|624x72](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard11/uploads/frax1/original/1X/b52d63369f94c6f8684766a0674e4def3a5e5802.png)\n\n![|624x69](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard11/uploads/frax1/original/1X/f054e501dd06abd10506143689439d31ac933639.png)\n\nThis should provide Everipedia some buffer if there are LP's who decide to cease liquidity provision as a result of moving the FRAX-IQ pool to the Frax gauge system.\n\n### **Motivation**\n\nThis proposal's motivation is to:\n\n1. Cease inefficient dilution to FXS holders directed at the FRAX-IQ pool outside the FXS gauge system\n2. Allow the Everipedia community to use its IQ token for gauge reward bribes instead of co-pool incentives\n\n### **Proposal**\n\nThis proposal will:\n\n1.

      "title": "FIP - 70 - Ozys (KLAYswap, Meshswap) x FRAX partnership Proposal - including liquidity provision",
      "content": "Dear FRAX community users!\n\nThe proposer is Ozys team, developer of KLAYswap, Orbit chain, Belt-fi, and our upcoming DEX protocol on the MATIC ecosystem. Our team has been discussing possible potential collaboration points with the FRAX team for a long period of time.\n\nThrough a series of discussions, we are pleased to present the exclusive financial opportunities to FRAX community users as well as our newly developed DEX protocol called ‘Meshswap’. Before further elaborating on the opportunities that our new DEX protocol ‘Meshswap’ would offer to the FRAX community, kindly allow us to briefly introduce the background of our new DEX protocol.\n\nMeshswap is a MATIC-customized version of DEX that follows the basic structure of KLAYswap and is also developed by Ozys. To be specific, KLAYswap is a Klaytn’s main DEX protocol that once took up about half of the liquidity in Klaytn ecosystem, which recorded $ 2 bil TVL(Total Value Locked) last year and ranked 17th globally. Based on the high level of performance and completeness on the product side (AMM, staking, leveraging, IDO, etc), and almost completely decentralized and effectively working governance system of KLAYswap, we are about to expand our ecosystem into MATIC ecosystem which holds more than $10 bil Market cap with our new DEX protocol, “Meshswap”.\n\nMain proposal contents\n\n1. Liquidity provision of FRAX by foundation in purpose of creating a pair pool on Meshswap\n\n* Creating FRAX pair pool including FRAX-MATIC, FRAX-MESH in Meshswap by foundation\n* $ 10 mil for each pool (size of liquidity that withstands $10,000 transaction with less than 1% of slippage)\n\n2. Partnership (FRAX x Meshswap)\n\n* FRAX to Meshswap: liquidity provision, co-promotion\n* Meshswap to FRAX: fruitful financial opportunities to users including mining, and adding leveraging feature for FRAX in purpose of transaction amplification\n\n* further cooperation with Ozys team (developer of KLAYswap, Orbit chain, Belt-fi, and Meshswap)\n\nBenefits for FRAX holders\n\n1. Higher return than any other DEX with high level of sustainability\n\nProviding liquidity on Meshswap gives practical opportunities for FRAX community users to ensure higher yields than any other DEX protocol with great stability. In case of KLAYswap, paired pools consist of stable and major coins such as ETH-Tether show more than 10% in APR with high level of sustainability and zero risk in protocol level. In Meshswap, to be more specific, MESH (governance token in Meshswap) reward is given to liquidity providers of major assets (ETH, MATIC, USDT, refer that as A class asset). And one of the cooperative agenda that our team has discussed with the FRAX team is to classify FRAX as A class asset in Meshswap, which enables FRAX to mine MESH inflation reward when pairing with other A class assets.\n\nThere are two characteristics that can secure a higher level of yield than any other DEX protocol when providing liquidity in Meshswap.\n\n* It is not difficult to take up a large share in liquidity at the new platform and a large share would lead to higher return\n\n* Since MESH is a fair launch case (Per block issuing model) which would show very little supply in the initial stage, which leads to higher yield\n* Active transaction volume in the initial stages, which also leads to a higher APR in AMM system\n\n2. Gaining governance power with mined MESH\n\nMeshswap is the community-driven DEX. Its native token “MESH” is the governance token that offers the opportunity for users to determine the yield rate of the protocol through our special pool voting as well as governance voting.\n\nBasically, MESH Stakers lock up their MESH in a certain period and earn MESH, and liquidity pool voting rights (vMESH) in return. Using vMESH, Stakers can vote on specific liquidity pools to allocate more MESH rewards and receive the distributed transaction fees incurred in the voted pool. Furthermore, as stakers are one of the most active contributors to the Meshswap ecosystem, they earn additional token airdrop rewards such as Drops and Ecopot.\n\n* $MESH Staker can directly decide which liquidity pool to allocate more $MESH through votes.\n* By utilizing this feature, FRAX holders can vote on FRAX-related pair pools in order to increase a yield for the pair and get profit at the same time with vMESH.\n\n3. Leverage farming\n\nMeshswap has a leverage feature called single/plus deposit just like KLAYswap. Assets that users deposit in a single pool are leveraged by plus pool deposit. Merits of single deposit is that users can earn a high level of interest just by depositing a single asset. Assets used in single deposit service are major assets that show a sizable amount of liquidity around many other exchanges such as ETH, USDT, XRP, and etc. On the other hand, plus deposit users can borrow assets from a single deposit and earn multiple yields than normal pair deposit in AMM.\n\nFRAX is one of the major stable coins with abundant growth potential. However, for the leverage system to work, there must be enough liquidity within Meshswap in order to avoid any unexpected liquidation risk. We would very much like to onboard FRAX on a single and plus deposit system once the pre-condition is met.\n\nMESH Tokenomics\n\n![|602x345](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard11/uploads/frax1/original/1X/14336b1edd2a75e23a5bdd07f470ea4fe778a6c7.png)\n\nOnce Meshswap officially launches, full-scale yield farming will begin. Daily MESH Inflation will be distributed to the entire ecosystem daily at the same rate accordingly:\n\nFarm (80%): It is for lenders, general/Leverage farmers, and stakers in Meshswap protocol.\n\nvKSP Holder (5%): It is for core Klayswap users to encourage the circulation of blockchain ecosystems in the long term.\n\nDevelopment (5%): It is for the continuous technology development and maintenance Treasury\n\nTreasury (5%): It is the business fund for emergencies and the future Meshswap ecosystem development.\n\nStrategic Partner (5%): It is the incentive fund for potential Polygon Dapp partners\n\nCommunity information\n\n-Telegram: https://t.me/MeshswapOfficial\n\n-Discord: https://discord.com/channels/954293013230809109/955312302926757919/963705316380409866**",

      "content": "### Proposal :\n#### 1. Official FRAX listing on DDDX. io under FRAX-USDC pair\n* With an official listing, FRAX-USDC can be easily accessed.\n* Start liquidity is required on DDDX platform- $5,000,000 in FRAX and $5,000,000 in USDC\n* The liquidity will be kept in the FRAX-USDC pair, which will be considered as a safety measure and add the trust of users, good for long-term users growth.\n* Frax Finance users will enjoy the lowest platform fee of 0.01% to swap for FRAX.\n* DDDX platform has a better stablecoin algorithm and governance model than Curve, will make the slippage of the FRAX-USDC lower, to help the FRAX swap price more stable and accurate.\n\n#### 2. DDDX tokens airdrop for Frax team & community members:\n\n* In tokenomics the initial total supply is 3,000,000 DDDX.\n\n* To start the partnership with Frax, 150,000 DDDX tokens (5% of the total supply ) will be shared to you in the form of veNFTs:\n\n  -For Frax team： 40% (60,000 DDDX)\n\n  -For Frax community members：60% (90,000DDDX) through random airdrops to 1000 users who hold ≥50,000 FRAX in their wallet. FCFS.\n\n* When Frax team and the community members get the veNFTs airdrop, they can vote for FRAX-USDC trading pair.\n\n   With these important votes, the FRAX-USDC pool will generate DDDX emission rewards, which will be sent to motivate the liquidity providers.\n\n   The Voters for FRAX-USDC can get the transaction fee and Bribe rewards of the trading pair.\n\n\n#### 3. Creating FXS Bribes Plan for 28 days.\n\n* Frax provides a Bribes plan for 4 weeks, sharing $ 40,000 of FXS per week, to reward the users who vote for the FRAX-USDC trading pair.\n\n* Providing bribes will attract more users to vote for this trading pair.\n\n* And with the votes, the trading pair will get more DDDX tokens emissions, thus will attract more liquidity providers to add liquidity to FRAX-USDC, and will bring more interest to your token.\n\n* The sum of the bribes should be $ 160,000 of FXS.\n\n\n#### 4. Others\n\n* Adding DDDX on the Frax Staking page: https://dddx.io/\n* Cross-marketing on Twitter & Discord\n* The DDDX protocol will be very glad to consider any potential integration in Frax Finance projects.\n\n*About DDDX. io*\n\n> DDDX. io is a DEX 2.0 platform for stable currency swaps. With the new AMM algorithm it achieves extremely low slippage and a 0.01% fee rate. Similar to Curve Finance, DDDX. io is also a community-led DEX platform that supports veToken governance (voting escrow tokenomics ) and ve(3,3) tokenomics.\n\n> Currently deployed on BNB Chain, DDDX. io plans to deploy & launch on Ethereum. Based on this, DDDX. io hopes to invite Frax as one of the Ethereum ecological partners to participate in the launch and the protocol governance.\n\n> DDDX protocol has done many optimizations and upgrades on the basis of the Solidly protocol launched by AC, and has a better economic model and transaction experience than Solidly. As we witnessed when Solidly was first deployed on Fantom, it has brought more than $ 2 billion of TVL to FTM, bringing impressive liquidity to the 20 protocol partners who have wisely participated in the governance.\n\n> We believe that the deployment of DDDX on Ethereum will also bring benefits to our partners, bring Frax more exposure and liquidity, and boost the growth of Frax.\n\n> **Audited by : CERTIK** \n**Partners on BSC**: Autofarm, Beefy, dForce, Moonpot, RabbitFinance etc.\n\n> Whitepaper & Tokenomics: https://dddx.gitbook.io/dddx.io/tokenomics/tokenomics/launch-plan-on-ethereum\n\n",

      "title": "FIP - 66 - Tightening the Partnership between Frax <>Sifchain",
      "content": "## Summary:\n\nThis proposal aims to strengthen the previously established partnership between Sifchain and FRAX as well as offer the FRAX community a good investment opportunity. If it passes, the FXS equivalent of $2,000,000, and $6,000,000 of Frax liquidity will be used to provide liquidity on Sifchain, bringing the total amount of liquidity provisions from the Frax treasury to $10,000,000 (2 Million dollars of FXS | 8 Million dollars of Frax).\n\nDeep Liquidity on Sifchain will establish a gateway into the Cosmos ecosystem for FXS, make FXS transferable over IBC, and eventually enable FXS to be used as collateral in margin trading positions against any token bridged to by Sifchain’s omni-EVM bridge. The additional liquidity provisions from Frax will generate sizable rewards for the Frax treasury, and garner more voting power on the Sifchain network.\n\n## Introduction\n\nMy name is Tungkhan from SifDAO, the DAO that operates Sifchain. Two months ago SifDAO made a proposal to Frax to bring FRAX liquidity to Sifchain. The proposal passed with great community enthusiasm and SifDAO matched the liquidity provided by Frax, bringing the TVL of the pool to $5,000,000.\n\nAs of the date of this writing (April 27th), the $2,000,000 provided by FRAX 2 months ago has generated ~$675,000 worth of ROWAN (Sifchain’s token) rewards, or an ROI of ~34%. We are looking to further build upon our partnership with the Frax community by bringing FXS to the DEX as well.\n\n## About Sifchain:\n\nSifchain is a Cosmos SDK built DEX. Our primary value proposition is that we will enable capital efficient cross-chain trading through two features: omni-EVM and deep margin. Other interesting aspects of Sifchain include our use of slip-based swap fees, eventual order-book implementation, governance driven monetary policy, and having ROWAN as a base pair for all pools.\n\nOmni-EVM: Sifchain aims to be the first Omni-Chain DEX, connecting to 20–25 blockchains for cross-chain integration. The targeted blockchains represent the overwhelming majority of all cryptocurrency trading volume - thus actively traded assets from all chains will be accessed through the Sifchain DEX. Omni-EVM will enable any ERC20 token, any Cosmos Token, and any token that exists on ANY EVM compatible blockchain to be imported and traded in Sifchain.\n\nDeep Margin: Hopefully coming as soon as Q3, Sifchain will deploy its novel architecture for margin trading - allowing traders to use leverage on their trades by borrowing from the liquidity pool. The interest rate is set based on market demand and liquidity supply. Liquidity providers are able to add liquidity into Sifchain’s pools symmetrically or asymmetrically, while MEV front-running in order placements is prevented through a commitment-reveal scheme.\n\nDeep Margin + Omni-EVM: Any ERC20 token or Cosmos Network token will be able to be used as collateral in any margin trading position. Likewise, any such token can be longed or shorted. This unlocks nearly unlimited margin trading pairs and enables users to utilize this feature on tokens that have previously never been possible.\n\n## Technical details:\n\nFollowing the standards outlined in [Bridge Mechanism - Frax Finance ¤ 2], FXS on Sifchain will not be the canonical representation of FXS, and as such it will be called sifFXS when traveling over IBC (Cosmos’s Inter-blockchain Communication Protocol).\n\n## An Investment Opportunity – Historical Metrics:\n\nThe partnership between FRAX and Sifchain resulted in the first liquidity provision from the Frax treasury of $2 million FRAX into the FRAX:ROWAN pool on March 2nd, 2022.\n\nOn-chain data showed that, on 27th April (at 12h30 GMT time), FRAX was providing $2.37 million of liquidity to the FRAX:ROWAN pool and staking $307k with Sifchain’s validator nodes. The total USD value of FRAX’s wallet was $2.675 million, making a profit of $675k over nearly 2 months or a ROI of ~34%.\n\nThis ROI is among the highest rates across DEXes throughout all cryptocurrencies. Many believe that these high ROIs are unsustainable, and we concur, which is why inflation is being reduced weekly in accordance with Sifchain’s long-term economic plans. Despite high APRs & inflation, by looking at ROWAN’s price over the past 3 months we find that it has performed remarkably well. It has not only been stable but even was one of the highest gainers on April 26rd. Its price rose by ~40% in two weeks when the rest of the market was going down.\n\n## Potential Landscape ahead:\n\nOn April 19th, 2022, we deployed the PMTP (Protocol Monetary Trade Policy) mechanism which aims to control ROWAN’s purchasing power, making it a valuable asset to hold, earn and stake. This breakthrough invention in DeFi will mark the beginnings of a new era because it gives SifDAO fine-tuned control over ROWAN’s monetary policy. Alongside the launch of PMTP we are dramatically reducing inflation, and have just deployed a new liquidity mining module which complements PMTP by allowing a flexible emissions schedule. Furthermore, the new liquidity mining module auto-compounds rewards back into the pool, creating continuously deeper pools and maximizing the Frax community’s returns with little effort.\n\nWe expect the release of Peggy 2, an omni-evm bridge by the end of Q2, and margin trading sometime in Q3. All of these novel features are expected to make ROWAN value held by FRAX communities a lot higher than it is currently. We are excited to inform you that today our TVL reached its ATH of $148 million, a ~200% gain from the last 2 months.\n\nWith all these facts in hand, we make a proposal for more FXS:ROWAN liquidity on Sifchain and believe this timely investment will further strengthen the partnership between FRAX-Sifchain, while bringing many benefits to the frax community.\n\n## Proposal Result:\n\nFor: Use $2,000,000 (2 million dollars) of FXS liquidity & $6,000,000 (6 million dollars) of FRAX from the treasury to provide liquidity on Sifchain\n\nAgainst: Do nothing\n\n## Appendix:\n\nFrax wallet data: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1XnaxH1fWc_cY6oVS5tPWb25bCHvkgV60pTz6Bva3GWk/edit?usp=sharing",

      "title": "FIP-60 - Goldfinch Senior Pool AMO",
      "content": "Authors\n\nAlvin Hsia and Blake West\n\nSummary\n\nCreate a Goldfinch AMO to provide liquidity to the Goldfinch Senior Pool, which will earn Frax non-crypto correlated yield and provide Goldfinch with capital to deploy in new Borrower Pools.\n\nBackground\n\nAs Frax grows, it becomes increasingly important that its collateral mix diversifies into safe yield assets with interest rate revenues coming from non-crypto correlated economic activity.\n\nGoldfinch is a decentralized credit protocol that has been designed from the ground up to do exactly this – bringing off-chain yields on-chain at scale. Read more about Goldfinch below.\n\nAbout Goldfinch\n\nGoldfinch is a decentralized credit protocol with a mission to expand access to capital and foster financial inclusion. We believe all of private credit markets will move on chain in the coming decade, and Goldfinch will be the marketplace for all of that activity. The protocol provides structured products that enables borrowers around the world to access dollar-denominated stablecoins to put to use in the real world.\n\nThe returns for lenders on Goldfinch are uncorrelated with the rest of crypto as borrowed capital is put to use in real-world use cases (not traders or MM’s).\n\nAs a lender, there are two options. You can choose to actively assess loans and earn higher yields by supplying first-loss capital as junior tranche Backers, or passively invest in an index of low-risk senior tranche loans as Liquidity Providers. Frax would do the latter.\n\nGoldfinch Metrics\n\nLive on-chain stats can be found here 3, with some key metrics:\n\n$115M TVL\n$100M+ in active loans\n0% in loan defaults.\n$100k/mo in recurring USDC treasury revenue\nAbout the Goldfinch Senior Pool / FIDU\n\nThe Goldfinch Senior Pool represents a diversified senior position on all outstanding loans on Goldfinch. When Liquidity Providers (LPs) supply to the Senior Pool, they receive an equivalent amount of FIDU, which is an ERC-20 token. At any time, Liquidity Providers can withdraw by redeeming their FIDU for USDC at an exchange rate based on the net asset value of the Senior Pool, minus a 0.5% withdrawal fee. This exchange rate for FIDU increases over time as interest payments are made back to the Senior Pool (similar to how Compound cTokens work).\n\nReturns\n\nVariable returns\nHistorically between ~4.5-9%\nCurrently ~8%\nMore data can be found on our Dune dashboard\nLiquidity\n\nLike Compound, liquidity is highly likely, but not guaranteed.\nThere is a 0.5% withdrawal fee to prevent certain flash loan attacks, and to incentivize longer term capital (break even time would be about 3 weeks at current rates)\n\nRisks / Structure / Protections\n\nAs the name implies, each investment from the Senior Pool is senior to the Backers who supply “junior” capital. Some important considerations\n\nThere is typically 20-25% of junior “buffer” in each deal. This means that 20-25% of the principal would need to be lost before the Senior Pool loses any money.\nEach loan itself is fully or over collateralized with off-chain assets or income. This varies from loan to loan, but they will either be senior secured to other lenders, or be backed with assets (such as the underlying loans) worth over 100% of the loan value. This effectively means that borrowers often provide 10-15% of equity capital that is junior even to the Backers.\nAll the Backers (usually dozens in a given deal) sign legal contracts with the borrower. They have recourse to go after a borrower in case of default.\nLegal contracts stipulate that borrowers must pay into the smart contracts, and the smart contracts enforce that the Senior Pool is paid first. So the Senior Pool is naturally protected with legal recourse by the Backers own interests.\nIncentives\n\nThere is currently a liquidity mining program incentivizing FIDU purchase. Staking your FIDU will earn you the Goldfinch governance token (GFI).\n\nGFI incentive adds ~14% APY at current prices (~$2.50/token)\nNote that rate assumes you hold for 12 months. Holding for less time will decrease the rate linearly (eg. 6 months is half the rate)\nThere is a proposal to remove the vesting period currently live on Goldfinch governance\n\nUnderlying Borrowers\n\nThe Borrowers on Goldfinch are generally fintech lending companies, primarily (~80%) in emerging markets. These borrowers all use technology in some way to have an edge in their lending.\n\nOne example is PayJoy, who does smart phone financing, and has special software installed on the phones so that if someone doesn’t pay, their phone shuts off. Another is Tugende who finances rent-to-own motorcycles for gig economy drivers in Kenya.\n\nIn America, borrowers include Braavo, a data-driven accounts receivable company.\n\nImportantly, a distribution channel for these deals is credit funds. Those funds originate and underwrite deals, then syndicating them out to the Goldfinch community of backers.\n\nGoldfinch borrowers exist in over 18 different countries, giving the loans geographic, regulatory, and monetary policy diversity. All past deals are viewable on the Goldfinch dapp.\n\nGoldfinch AMO\n\nWe propose creating a Goldfinch AMO that invests into the Goldfinch Senior Pool. This would generate yield for Frax that is uncorrelated with the rest of crypto, while providing liquidity for Goldfinch to allocate towards loans. We propose the authorization of up to $100m worth of liquidity for use in the AMO.\n\nHow Does This Benefit Frax?\n\nGrow the treasury with safe, attractive yield that is truly uncorrelated with the rest of the crypto markets. No market makers or crypto traders or wild leverage here. Just real economic growth from nearly two dozen countries.\nLow governance overhead. - The Senior Pool is a perpetual and scalable. New deals are constantly being added and paid back. The size of the pool will keep growing, and the assessment is not with one particular fund manager, but more the broader community who will continue to bring on many amazing borrowers.\nDiversified and scalable by default - The Senior Pool is not one fund manager. There is no cap on the fund size. It is composed of many companies and many funds, automatically scaling with the Goldfinch protocol, and continually diversified across all of them, without any new actions required.\n\nProposal\n\nYes: Create an AMO for Goldfinch.\n\nNo: Do nothing.",

Also, this gauge oddly incentivizes staking SUSHI more than staking ETH or even FXS.\n\nWe would like to propose removing the gauge from FXS as this essentially allows stable pools and other FRAX/FXS/FPI/FPIS-focused pools to gain more rewards. Also, FXS emission would be used more efficiently for the stability of FRAX as well as the extension of the market cap of that.\n\nThis is somewhat of an unusual proposal and it will also be used as a way to test community sentiment on having FXS receiving gauges on pools that source their yield from FXS.\n\n### Implementation:\n\nWe will set the farm reward to 0 for SUSHI-FRAX pool and people can withdraw from the farm afterward.\n\n### Poll:\n\n* Kill FRAX-SUSHI gauge\n* Do Nothing\n\n### Appendix:\n\nFRAX Circulating Supply Breakdown: https://dune.com/embeds/438341/834148/bd8e0361-bb3b-45a2-bd8d-b87688238e95\n\nFXS Gauges data references:\n\n* https://app.frax.finance/staking\n* https://community.frax.finance/stake/gauge\n\nFXS Gauges:\n\n|Pool|Weekly FXS Rewards|Weekly % Rewards|TLV|Total LP token|Staked LP Tokens|Annual Percentage Reward|\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|FRAX/USDC (Uniswap V3)|26349|30.1 %|$263,252,000|48970|47943|12.76%|\n|FRAX/TEMPLE (Temple)|20628|23.6 %|$43,243,000|6237000|6235000|59.55%|\n|FRAX/DAI (Uniswap V3)|16358|18.7 %|$158,671,000|31913000000|30404000000|13.50%|\n|FRAX/SUSHI (Sushiswap)|11012|12.6 %|$26,741,000|8312000|8307000|51.42%|\n|FRAX/agEUR (Uniswap V3)|2920|3.3 %|$14,623,000|103620000|103610000|24.92%|\n|FRAX/3CRV (StakeDAO)|1895|2.2 %|$45,573,000|40143000|19982000|10.43%|\n|FRAX-Orbit (Vesper)|1699|1.9 %|$13,947,000|13799000|13776000|15.23%|\n|FRAX/mUSD (mStable)|1071|1.2 %|$10,579,000|10558000|10552000|12.64%|\n|FRAX/DAI (Gelato)|879|1 %|$7,493,000|1491000000|1491000000|14.64%|\n|FRAX-ETHput (StakeDAO)|748|0.9 %|$20,522,000|16123000|12343000|5.94%|\n|FRAX/VST (Curve)|545|0.6 %|$9,061,000|9047000|8603000|7.89%|\n\nAll the info here is based on market info on 5/3/2022\nCurrent FXS Price (at 5/3/2022) : $24.749\n\nSUSHI-FRAX Address: 0xe06f8d30ac334c857fc8c380c85969c150f38a6a\n\nSUSHI-FRAX Gauge: 0xb4Ab0dE6581FBD3A02cF8f9f265138691c3A7d5D\n\n",

      "title": "FIP-63- Frax <> Lend Flare Partnership Update",
      "content": "Hello everyone, \n\n\nFirst, thank you for approving our first proposal. We took into account the reviews from Frax community members that our first proposal was not very detailed, and here is an updated version of Lend Flare first proposal.\n\n### Summary:\nCreate a new partnership between Frax and Lend Flare by:\n- Integrating Frax as a supplied asset on Lend Flare, which will create a new yield opportunity for Frax stablecoin holders and allow loans of Frax against most Curve LP on Lend Flare.\n- Doing co-marketing (Twitter AMA, shared documentation, joint Medium article, mutual communication inside both communities).\n\n### The problem Lend Flare aims to solve:\nMore than a dex, Curve can be seen as a liquidity reserve or somehow a DeFi saving account. At the moment, this liquidity earns a yield composed of curve rewards and trading fees.  \nNevertheless, there are few additional opportunities for curve LP holders to take advantage of this huge liquidity, especially with low risk and high flexibility. Lend Flare provides a solution to this problem. \n\n### A quick presentation of Lend Flare:\nLend Flare is a decentralized borrowing platform on Ethereum blockchain. **Its added value is to allow Curve LP holders (the borrowers) to draw fixed-rate, fixed-term, and high LTV loans against Curve LP used as collateral, with no concerns for assets being liquidated due to price fluctuation.** \nLiquidity providers (the lenders) who deposit loan liquidity for borrowers on Lend Flare receive in exchange a share of loan fees and an incentive in LFT token (Lend Flare governance token) for their participation. LFT tokenomics follow the curve ve-model, with a fair launch (no seed rounds, team get only 2% of max supply with a 2-year linear vesting).\n\n### Why is Lend Flare interested in a partnership with Frax?\n- As part of its core strategy, Lend Flare already proposes to its borrowers a large selection of curve LPs, including the fraxCrv (frax+3crv) pool. But, at the moment, only USDC, DAI, wBTC, ETH can be borrowed against curve LPs. Lend Flare wants to integrate different supplied assets mainly for three reasons:\n1. Stay at the forefront of innovation in DeFi, by proposing new products seen as robust, like Frax.\n2. Diversify our supplied assets with a view to minimizing risks\n3. Offer more choices to users according to their personal preference\nFrax stablecoin as a supplied asset fits these 3 criterias, and it’s the main reason for its integration and our partnership proposal. \n- Moreover, with the upcoming launch of Lend Flare V2 and V3 ( especially the launch of Lend Flare synthetic stablecoin), we also have in mind other use cases for Frax in Lend Flare that can enrich Lend Flare new features. This can be discussed later in another proposal, with more technical details.\n\n### How can Frax benefit from a partnership with Lend Flare?\nLend Flare is a low risk, high LTV borrowing platform. By allowing Frax as a supplied asset, Lend Flare creates new use cases for Frax stablecoin. With Lend Flare growth, it’s reasonable to expect growth in Frax adoption on Lend Flare too. \n- By creating a Lend Flare supply pool for Frax stablecoin, it creates a yield opportunity for Frax holders who are willing to provide liquidity. At the moment, there are plenty of opportunities with usdt/usdc/dai, but to our knowledge much less with Frax stablecoin. Lend Flare can help fill this gap.\nFrax suppliers could expect similar yields, depending on their locked LFT amounts. With Lend Flare fair tokenomics (low vesting continuous-release, low-medium inflation), we hope that this opportunity will be sustainable in the long run.\n- Frax could be borrowed up to 85% LTV on Lend Flare, with all curve LPs as collateral, and especially frax3crv as collateral. Potentially, this will lead to an increase in the number of Frax users.\n- Frax could be borrowed up to 85% LTV on Lend Flare, with all curve LPs as collateral, and especially frax3crv as collateral. Potentially, this will lead to an increase in the number of Frax users.\n- Besides, after the V2 release, for all curve LPs deposited on Lend Flare, and so frax3crv, CRV and CVX rewards are going to be automatically compounded. Hence, Frax3crv holders will receive a reward boost up to 50%.\n\nAs said in the answer to the previous question, Lend Flare V2 and V3 will bring new features, and if frax community becomes confident about Lend Flare platform, the partnership between the two protocols could evolve according to our mutual interest.\n\n### Concerning our past proposal:\nThe last two points inside our last proposal (frax-lft token swap, Curve pool with Frax/Lend Flare synthetic asset) is what Lend Flare team aims for in the near future, after the integration of Frax as a supplied asset.  \n\nAt the moment, with the upcoming releases of Lend Flare V2 and Curve 4pool, we would like to focus more on raising awareness between Lend Flare and Frax communities, before submitting another proposal with all the necessary technical details (like the borrow interest model for frax stablecoin, initial frax funding …). So here is below our updated proposal. \n\n### Our updated proposal:\n1. Integration of Frax as a supplied asset on Lend Flare.\n\n2. A Frax Medium article, co-written, on how to supply Frax and frax3crv on Lend Flare.\n\n3. Continuous interactions directly with both communities, on Discord/Telegram, by sharing and discussing updates about both protocols.\n\n\nThe Lend Flare team\n\nhttps://app.lendflare.finance/\nhttps://en-docs.lendflare.finance/\nhttps://twitter.com/LendFlareOffic\nhttps://discord.gg/p23C9jMNdW",

These functions allow anyone to swap collateral (USDC) to/from the protocol at the Chainlink oracle price of FXS. These functions serve to make sure the amount of collateral the protocol has match the target collateral ratio either by using excess collateral to burn FXS and matching the CR or by minting FXS to taken in USDC to raise the CR to target.\n\nDocumentation can be seen here:\nhttps://docs.frax.finance/fxs-buybacks-and-recollateralization \n\nThese functions essentially serve the purpose of either increasing or decreasing the collateral held on the balance sheet to make sure the CR is properly on target.\n\nWith the advent of Fraxswap and TWAMMs, these swaps can be done in as decentralized and permissionless of a manner through an AMO contract that sets up TWAMMs for the appropriate assets. This is one of the main use cases that Fraxswap was  in fact built for. \n\nDocumentation for Fraxswap TWAMMs can be found at: https://docs.frax.finance/fraxswap/technical-specifications\n\n# Proposal\n\nPermanently deprecate the above functions to perform the same monetary policy through a TWAMM AMO and Fraxswap buy/sell orders of TWAMMs. This has the same trust assumptions and monetary policy effects but is more capital efficient, useful, and helps bring more trading activity+usage of Fraxswap, our native AMM. \n\n## For:\nDeprecate buyback() and recollateralize() functions and deploy a TWAMM AMO contract to set buy/sell orders of FRAX, collateral, and/or FXS directly on Fraxswap\n\n## Against:\nDo nothing.",

      "content": "For more information about this proposal, please see the full discussion here: https://gov.frax.finance/t/pitch-x-frax-comprehensive-partnership/1268/3\n\nSummary: Approve Pitch to stake FXS from a smart contract and establish a gauge for pitchFXS/Frax\n\nBackground & Motivation\nPitch is a new project that builds governance tooling, offering increased yield and utility for token holders and greater security to DAOs at large. https://pitch.money\n\nPitch is currently known for its vote-incentives application, which has processed seven figures of rewards to date. The application fixed many well-known bugs in bribe.crv.finance’s original implementation while introducing the notion of “elastic rewards”, where protocols specify the precise price-per-vote they will pay for a gauge vote. This creates a novel mechanism for governance price discovery and helps de-risk protocols from wasting their community budget.\n\nHowever, one Pitch’s largest shortcomings so far is its inability to auto-compound historical rewards. This is due to the fundamental architecture of veFXS and cannot be solved without introducing a new paradigm in governance management. \n\nIt’s fundamentally impossible in the current paradigm for users to simultaneously:\n● Engage in FXS governance (and/or capture related yield)\n● Leverage their FXS holdings via lending and other financial instruments\n● Have liquidity\n\nPitch can fix this problem, and the solution is fully discussed in the governance forum linked above. Whitelisting Pitch as a veFXS staker with a pitchFXS liquid token and gauge (which requires periodic lockups to actively vote) is all that's needed for this to launch.\n\nProposal\nFor - Whitelist Pitch as a veFXS Staker and approve pitchFXS/Frax as a gauge\nAgainst - Do nothing",

      "content": "For more information about this proposal, please see the full discussion here: https://gov.frax.finance/t/fip-56-truefi-amo/1236\n\n**Author**\n\nRyan Rodenbaugh\n\n**Summary**\n\nCreate a TrueFi AMO to provide liquidity directly to the TrueFi Protocol\n\n**About TrueFi**\n\nTrueFi was DeFi’s first uncollateralized lending protocol. TrueFi aims to be the leading protocol allowing Asset Managers (we call them “portfolio managers”) to run lending strategies on-chain. Apart from already-proven lending strategies to crypto-native institutions, TrueFi is actively working with 3rd party Portfolio Managers who are interested in running their strategies on our protocol.\n\nWe are aiming to bridge the gap between RWA and DeFi and provide a platform where RWA originators can access crypto capital.\n\nSince TrueFi’s launch in November 2020\n\n* The protocol has originated ~$1.4bn in uncollateralized loans across 121 loans and ~35 borrowers with 0 defaults.\n\n* The protocol currently supports USDC, USDT, TUSD, and BUSD and offers loans ranging from 30 to 180 days.\n* Average borrower rates (without token incentives) are roughly 9.5% with a range from 7.16% - 18%.\n\n* Total interest generated between November 2020 and today is 19.32mm USD\n\n**Background and Motivation**\n\n- Stablecoins (such as FRAX) are money-printing machines that have the potential to completely alter how we think about capital deployment and the cost of capital within the crypto markets. TrueFi has proven itself to be a reliable source of yield for crypto lenders and would like to partner with FRAX as a source of reliable revenue for the protocol. \n\n- For this first AMO, the idea is to generate yield for FRAX while also tapping into a new source of liquidity for TrueFi (win/win situation). Longer-term there are a number of additional partnership opportunities that we could pursue:\n\n     - Given our large base of trading and market-making firms along with TrueFi’s plans for L2 expansion, we can help to create market-maker-focused lending pools to increase FRAX liquidity on L2s. \n     - In addition, we will be onboarding several RWA-type lending opportunities over the coming months and if FRAX would like exposure to those types of opportunities, we are happy to present those, as well. \n\nFor the initial proposal, we will seek USDC and FRAX liquidity. For USDC, we have several products that FRAX could deposit the USDC into, including our permissionless pools. We also have products such as an “Alameda single-borrower pool” where Alameda is the only borrower in the pool. For FRAX liquidity, we would aim to create a new FRAX pool where we will have many of the same market makers on the platform borrowing FRAX. Once approved, we will work with the FRAX team to decide on the optimal pool/portfolio to deposit the funds into based on FRAX's preference for yield/risk/duration. \n\nExcited for the opportunity to partner!\n\n**Proposal**\n\nCreate a TrueFi AMO and authorize up to $100m worth of liquidity for use in the AMO ($50mm in USDC, $50mm in FRAX). \n\nFor: Create the TrueFi AMO\n\nAgainst: Do nothing",

Options markets are still in their infancy with only $1 billion in TVL while spot dex’s have nearly $70 billion in TVL. In traditional markets, derivatives such as options are anywhere between 8x-20x more liquid than their spot counterparts. There will be several catalysts needed for the same to happen with options markets in DeFi, but one necessary component will be having sufficient liquidity. Frax is in a unique position to supply the capital necessary for Thetanuts’ vaults given its proven record of stability, cooperation, and innovating protocol design. A collaboration with Thetanuts would lead to increased demand for Frax while improving the TVL of Thetanuts.\n\nIn this collaboration, Frax will be deployed in Thetanuts version one index product to sell a variety of puts (example, eth puts and wbtc puts) that aggregate to a single index token. This enables Frax holders to generate outsized risk adjusted base yields in Frax, resulting from top market makers such as Alameda, QCP Capital, Ledgerprime, Genesis, GSR, and Wintermute actively participating in Thetanuts option vaults.\n\nThis product differentiates Thetanuts from its peers and benefits Frax holders because:\n\nThetanuts creates a high yield risk adjusted scenario estimated at ~50% for 2021 via its index because users are no longer seeing their risk concentrated on a single strike and tenor. This can be observed from the back test.\nThetanuts does not take fees on its base vaults. This ensures that Frax holders continue to receive the highest base yield in the DeFi options space.\nThetanuts index product will be multichain unlike current defi option vaults which are available for access only on their source chain creating a superior user experience.\n\nAdditionally as the collaboration grows, Frax will gain traction as a standard for settlement in the dealing of financial derivatives. Thetanuts benefits as it is able to build out a comprehensive options market by having vaults on varying strikes and tenors for various assets. This would be a critical step in creating a full service decentralized options trading platform. For these reasons, a collaboration between Frax and Thetanuts will be mutually fruitful.\n\nProposal\nCreate a Thetanuts AMO and authorize up to $10m of liqudiity for use in the AMO.\n\nFor: Create the Thetanuts AMO\n\nAgainst: Do nothing\n\n",

The recent FPI/FRAX Curve pool has recently passed its governance proposal to be added to their Gauge Controller(https://dao.curve.fi/vote/ownership/166 1) and will begin to receive CRV rewards, and subsequently CVX rewards.\n\nWe can use a wrapped staking position on Convex to create an erc20 token that receives CRV and CVX. This token can then be staked on a Frax Finance gauge to then also receive FXS rewards.\n\nThe FPI pool should be a main target for incentives as keeping FPI with ample liquidity should be a protocol goal.\n\nThis will accumulate multiple rewards from multiple protocols into one position and vastly grow the pool size.\n\nThe wrapped staking position itself will be an unmanaged trustless position. An example of this wrapper can be found being used on Abracadabra and on our github (platform/contracts/contracts/wrappers at main · convex-eth/platform · GitHub 2).\n\nFor:\nCreate a wrapped Convex position for the FPI/FRAX pool and add it to the Frax Finance Gauge Controller.\n\nAgainst:\nDo nothing.",

Official FRAX listing on Biswap under FRAX-BUSD pair\nWhile every token FRAX is traded on Biswap once a liquidity pool is created, users are met with a caution message of an imported token. With an official listing, FRAX-BUSD can be easily accessed through a token search. Over time FRAX will also be included in the Fee Return promotion, letting users gain up to 90% fee return in BSW.\n\n- For the FRAX official listing is required the start liquidity on Biswap - is $1 000 000 in FRAX and $1 000 000 in BUSD for the FRAX-BUSD pair.\n- In case Biswap is considered as the main DEX on BSC for Frax Finance, the liquidity will be kept in the FRAX-BUSD pair. Biswap is open to using any liquidity lockers by the Frax Finance team, it will be additional trust and security points for the community\n- Frax Finance users will have the opportunity to buy FRAX with the lowest platform fee of 0.1%\n- Adding Biswap on the Frax Integrations page\n\n\n2. Potential creation of Stake FRAX-BNB LP - Earn BSW Farm\nBiswap Farms allow users to stake FRAX-BNB LP tokens and get BSW rewards for staking. It will increase the number of long-term FRAX holders, as well as increase liquidity to provide lower slippage.\n\nAlong with participation in Farms, liquidity providers get 0.05% of all swaps made inside the trading pair as a fee reward.\n\nOnce FRAX trading volumes on Biswap grow and achieve significant average daily trading volumes (through several days) Biswap will consider the creation of Stake FRAX-BNB LP - Earn BSW Farm.\n\nOther factors that may impact Farm creation include the project’s community health, security issues, roadmap release postponement, and implementation of other agreement points.\n\nFarming pairs on Biswap are reconsidered on a monthly basis depending on their trading volumes.\n\nExisting Farms on Biswap could be found here: https://biswap.org/farms\n\n\n3. Creating the Stake BSW | Earn FRAX Launchpool for 30 days that will spread FRAX tokens among more than 125 000+ BSW holders. Biswap Launchpools allow users to earn crypto for holding BSW. Providing liquidity on Biswap Launchpools will increase your target audience among Biswappers and investors. That will bring more interest to your token, increase its trustworthiness, and boost the number of holders.\n\nThe required sum is $100 000 in FRAX for Stake BSW | Earn FRAX Unlimited Launchpool (30 days).\n\n\n4. The Biswap side will gladly consider any potential integration of Biswap in the Frax Finance project \n\n\n5. Adding Biswap on the Frax Staking page: https://app.frax.finance/staking\n\n\n6. Considering Biswap as your main DEX on BNB Smart Chain. It means keeping a major part of FRAX liquidity in Biswap liquidity pools, leading to a strong co-marketing and co-promotional strategy which will have a beneficial impact on both projects\n\n\n7. Step-by-step cross-marketing accompanying Frax Finance’s side marketing & Promo Strategy for the most powerful collaboration boost.",

      "title": "FIP 54- FRAX + Citadel: Bringing BTC to Frax",
      "content": "Discussion thread: https://gov.frax.finance/t/fip-54-frax-citadel-bringing-btc-to-frax/1192\n\nAuthor: On behalf of the Citadel DAO community\n\n# Introduction\n\nCitadel is a treasury DAO aiming to be the largest community owned Bitcoin position in the world. The treasury and protocol will be governed by the CTDL token, with a predominant Bitcoin treasury actively earning yield and shared with long term CTDL holders. Citadel DAO is a sub DAO to Badger.\n\nIt will leverage unique funding mechanics to accelerate the continuous growth of its treasury while using the power of BadgerDAO’s tried and tested vault strategies to optimize its yield.\n\nTo ensure it can create sustainable yield on its Bitcoin positions it will hold not only Bitcoin (+ BTC LP’s), but also yield influence assets across DeFi (eg. CVX, FXS and BADGER). This enables Citadel to wield large influence across multiple ecosystems and fight for Bitcoin to get the yield it deserves.\n\nTo better understand how Citadel works, CTDL token mechanics and elastic emissions, review Citadel DAO’s tokenomic deep dive article here https://thecitadeldao.medium.com/tokenomics-deep-dive-a11e7f5e2083\n\nFor a comprehensive overview of all the details of Citadel DAO please review our introduction article: https://thecitadeldao.medium.com/introducing-the-citadel-dao-551849104d26\n\n## CTDL Launch Event\n\nCitadel DAO’s goal is to have a completely fair and transparent launch while distributing ownership of CTDL to not only users that participate early but to a select group of DAO’s/dapps across our ecosystem, that align with the core values of Citadel. Their alignment and vested interest will accelerate Citadel’s ability to effectively deploy its treasury to benefit all participants in the ecosystem.\n\nWe call this launch the Citadel Knighting Round.\n\nOver the course of multiple days users will be able to swap BTC and yield influence assets for xCTDL.\n\nOnly users who qualify for the whitelist can participate in the launch event. The whitelist selection criteria will be based on a combination of actions users have taken in the Badger ecosystem and in our partners dapps, like Frax. The group of partners/knights have been revealed over the last month and consists of;\n\n* Frax\n* Convex\n* Redacted\n* Ren\n* TRIBE\n* Alchemix\n* Tokemak\n* JonesDAO\n\nAll of the Citadel Knights are also whitelisted to participate in the launch event themselves, leveraging their treasuries.\n\nThe current launch event details being discussed amongst Citadel DAO community members are as follows;\n\n#### Round 1 (Core Treasury Boostrap): Uncapped, whitelist participants only, open to bribes, fixed price of $21/CTDL\n        \n#### Accepted assets: WBTC, bibbtc/sbtc (ibbtc Badger vault token), ETH, FRAX, USDC\n\nAssets will be rebalanced post launch to reflect the Citadel DAO policy teams ideal treasury composition for optimizing yield and BTC exposure\n\n#### Round 2 (Yield Influence) : Capped (amount TBD), no whitelist, no bribes, fixed price of $25/CTDL\n\n#### Accepted assets: Badger and CVX\n\nFor a detailed breakdown of CTDL token distribution and launch event please refer back to the discussion thread on the governance forum: https://gov.frax.finance/t/fip-54-frax-citadel-bringing-btc-to-frax/1192\n\nThis launch event is the ONLY distribution of CTDL tokens. There were no prior investment rounds, private or public.\n\n# Proposal\n\n## Frax DAO participates in Round 1 of launch\n\nTo further align the two DAO’s, introduce BTC backing to FRAX, accelerate FRAX’s yield influence and support the growth of 4pool on Curve, we’re proposing FRAX DAO participates in the initial launch event using protocol capital. This is at the same fixed price as the whitelisted users from partner communities and the only distribution of pre-protocol launch CTDL.\n\nTo gain community wide sentiment, we’re proposing 3 different participation amounts for the purpose of deciding the adequate allocation collectively;\n\n* $21M ($16M in FRAX & $5M in FXS) @$21 per CTDL = 1,000,000 CTDL\n* $15M ($12M in FRAX & $3M in FXS) @$21 per CTDL = 714,285 CTDL\n* $11M ($9M in FRAX & $2M in FXS) @$21 per CTDL = 523,809 CTDL\n\n## What will Citadel DAO do with the FRAX & FXS?\n\n### Create deep liquidity for BTC/4 Pool on Curve\n\nCitadel will pair the FRAX provided with WBTC from its treasury (in a new wbtc/4pool) and provide liquidity for the Curve v2 pool it intends to launch. Today most of the volume of BTC <> stablecoins on Curve goes through the tricrypto pool. Introducing deep liquidity for the 4pool against BTC, will provide additional utility for FRAX and alternative routes for swapping with BTC on Curve. This is, of course, contingent on the creation and gauge approval for 4pool – if the gauge is not approved, Citadel DAO could create a wbtc/frax pool instead to execute the same strategy.\n\nOutside of providing liquidity, Citadel DAO will support yield on this pool through its Convex farming strategy. Using its potentially large CVX position along with bribing, Citadel DAO will push vote weight to optimize the CRV and CVX rewards allocated to this pool via bi-weekly Curve/Convex gauge votes. This will not only help with the wbtc/4pool, but also the overall adoption of 4pool across DeFi.\n\nTo optimize the returns and increase influence for Citadel leveraging this pool, Badger will design a custom LP vault (wbtc/4pool) that participates both in Convex and FXS ecosystems. This vault strategy will allow Citadel to earn more CVX (locked) to influence the yield on this pool, grow liquidity, lock more FXS and support the cvxFXS peg, while creating a flywheel to redistribute BTC to CTDL lockers (which FRAX could be one of the largest).\n\n\n![Citadel_FRAX-Convex_strategy_2.png](ipfs://Qmb5SmWre3CtScfDnRpMTy8NSQcXAASRmBoYa9AuLV72ww)\n\n### Become a long term locker of FXS and gauge system supporter\n\nCitadel DAO will max lock the FXS received for veFXS. Assuming a FXS gauge approval for bwbtc/4pool (Badger vault token) and protocol whitelisting, Citadel DAO will use its vote weight to drive additional yield in the form of FXS. It will then use that FXS to support the cvxFXS peg and lock more as veFXS.\n\nThis further aligns Citadel DAO with FRAX as both would be large participants in each others protocols governance along with long term supporters.\n\n### Introduce BTC backing to FRAX\n\nThe launch of wbtc/4pool on Curve opens up a unique opportunity for Frax Finance to introduce BTC to the backing of FRAX. If Frax were to extend its existing Curve or Convex AMO to this pool, The protocol can use it to create additional peg stability and farm more CVX while increasing the backing of the LP (wbtc/4pool) for FRAX.\n\nThis is contingent on the Frax core team building out an AMO to support this, but in preliminary conversations this seems like something they are open to doing.\n\n## What does Frax get from this?\n\nFrax will receive voted locked CTDL (vlCTDL) in exchange for their participation, which has a 21 week lock.\n\nHolders of xCTDL will also have the option to LOCK their xCTDL for a fixed period of 7 epochs (each epoch is 3 weeks, so this amounts to 21 weeks). In return for locking xCTDL, lockers will receive the following additional rewards:\n\n* 2x boost on CTDL emissions (for example, if a user was receiving 1% of CTDL emissions when staking xCTDL, they would receive 2% with vlCTDL).\n* Share of Funding revenue generated — paid out in BTC\n* Share of treasury yield — paid out in BTC\n* Governance rights to vote on whitelisting protocols for Citadel treasury deployment and which assets to accept for continuous funding (ie. allow for swapping to discounted xCTDL).\n\nFrax would directly benefit from the yield being generated on the Citadel DAO treasury, which would consist of the FRAX and FXS received for participation. It will also receive a consistent flow of BTC into its own treasury that could be used to further grow the backing of BTC in the FRAX asset.\n\nFrax would also have influence over how the treasury is deployed and which assets the treasury takes in. This is important for ensuring Citadel DAOs long term alignment with Frax.\n\n## Citadel + FRAX become a force TOGETHER\n\nTogether, Citadel and Frax can support yield on bitcoin, grow utility of FRAX, grow 4pool adoption, have another strategic partner in the Curve renaissance, and Frax can gain significant influence around one of the largest BTC treasuries in the world. On top of it all, FRAX will have a protocol committed to being a long term holder and participant of the FXS ecosystem.\n\n# Bribe to Earn More Influence\n\nThere is 5% of the entire CTDL supply allocated to partners of Citadel. By using the Hidden Hand platform from Redacted (currently supports Frax Hidden Hand 3 ) during the launch event, users can vote for 1 of the 8 partner DAO’s when participating in the sale. The more votes a partner DAO gets, the larger share of the 5% supply they will receive.\n\nSeparate from the proposed participation of $21, $15M or $11M, to gain a larger share of this pool, we propose a $2M ONE TIME bribe in the form of FXS that will go directly to users.\n\nThis would amplify all of the outlined benefits in the previous sections, as Frax would become an even larger vlCTDL holder increasing its overall yield in CTDL and BTC.\n\n## How will the participation and bribe amounts be executed?\n\nPrior to the community sale, Frax DAO would send the approved participation amount in Frax and FXS to the Citadel DAO multisig, which is governed by its token holders and 5 signers. Citadel DAO would then send the Frax DAO multisig xCTDL at the time of token & protocol launch after the completion of the 2 community rounds. Frax would then lock that xCTDL as vlCTDL via the Citadel DAO smart contracts.\n\nFor the $2M FXS bribe, that would be handled exclusively through the Hidden Hands platform with no control by the Citadel DAO.\nConclusion\n\n\n### Resources\n\nDiscord - https://discord.gg/citadeldao\n\nTwitter - https://twitter.com/TheCitadel_DAO 7\n\nGithub - https://github.com/Citadel-DAO/citadel-contracts\n\nBlog - https://thecitadeldao.medium.com/ 3\n\n# Vote\n\nChoose 1 of the 4 options outlined below.

Recently we have also started bribing on the Pitch.money platform to further evangelise the FRAX ecosystem. Now we plan to double down on our commitment by launching STAX Finance, which will enable users to easily zap into the TEMPLE/FRAX LP pair, TEMPLE vault strategies, and partake in other FRAX gauge yields in the future. By building a user-friendly interface to automate FRAX investments for investors to receive FXS yields and bribes from existing platforms such as Hidden Hands and Pitch, STAX aims to become the best place to stake into Frax gauges.\n\nSince STAX lowers the barrier to gaining exposure to the Frax ecosystem while facilitating the accumulation and removal of FXS from circulation to drive demand, this deepening of our existing partnership would be a win-win for both protocols.",

We find that the Frax protocol is building the most robust monetary system in all of DeFi and seek to become positive-sum partners well into the future.\n\nGLORY is the revenue-bearing asset and Eternity governance token. GLORY can be used to purchase items. GLORY is primarily rewarded in-game for completing significant challenges or special events and can be staked in exchange for experience potions - important consumables which can help level up Heroes. GLORY stakers also qualify for rare NFT airdrops, in-game achievements, and access to special challenges and Heroes. Finally, stakers receive voting rights on the future direction of game content and the grander story of Eternity.\n\n\nInvestment Terms\n\n$500,000 allocation for FRAX Protocol\n\n$0.66/GLORY\n\n$33M Fully Diluted Value\n\nInvestment paid for in AMO Profits (approximately 12 hours of protocol profit)\n\n6 month lock, then 2 Year Vest with quarterly cliffs\n\n\nActions\n\nFor: Invest in Eternity & attain the full $500k allocation\n\nAgainst: Do nothing\n\n",

      "title": "FRAX x Across Protocol",
      "content": "Summary\n1. Set up a relayer with 250K worth of FRAX tokens.\n2. Set up and Fund a FRAX liquidity pool for 500k-750k\n\nBackground and Motivation\nAcross (https://across.to/) is a token bridge built on Ethereum with L2-L1 on Arbitrum, Optimism, Boba and soon additional bridges and L2-L2 interoperability. Built from the team behind UMA, its unique implementation of relayers and liquidity pools allow it to boast itself as the fastest and cheapest bridge for token bridging.\n\nThe Ethereum ecosystem is currently plagued by high fees and usage is uneconomical for most participants. The rollup ecosystem (collectively known as L2s) is robust and growing immensely - its promise of scale and keeping transactions fees low means that they will eventually dominate usage over L1 mainnet and thus we need to think of the future where many (if not most) projects will be based on some of these L2 chains.\n\nFRAX is currently ranked 6 on the Coingecko Stablecoins category with a market cap of about $2.9B, and is one of the largest decentralized algorithmic stablecoin projects on Ethereum behind DAI. To ensure its leadership position and to remain competitive, FRAX should become one of the most liquid assets on as many chains as possible. Complementary to other token bridging solutions, having FRAX be accessible across many different bridging platforms minimizes centralization risk.\n\nThis is where Across comes in - we plan to provide some of the necessary backend infrastructure to allow FRAX to be transferred quickly and as cheaply as possible across supported chains. Efficient and positive usage will allow Across to further its mission and deepen its relationship, and to scale up liquidity. In the near future, there will be potential to incentivize FRAX LP on Across which would further drive demand higher for FRAX. \n\nSpecification\nTo create a system for bridging FRAX using Across for fast, low cost bridging requires 2 components.\n\nThe first component is to set up a ‘relayer’. Risk Labs (UMA) would be working with the FRAX team to demonstrate how a relayer can be set up with the intent that the FRAX team will run the relayer themselves; alternatively, FRAX could lend 250k $FRAX to Risk Labs to run a relayer on behalf of the FRAX team. Risk Labs will not charge Frax Finance for any costs of running the relayer for at least 3 months.\n\nThe second component is the liquidity pool. This would constitute funding the liquidity pool with 500k-750k $FRAX as a reasonable amount to start with. If all goes well, we anticipate expanding significantly in a subsequent snapshot based on Across demand. \n\nExample Transaction & Mechanics\nBob wants to move 100,000 FRAX from Arbitrum to Mainnet. He puts it into a deposit box in Arbitrum. The relayer sees that deposit and fronts the FRAX to him on Mainnet. After a 2hr dispute period, the relayer gets reimbursed by the FRAX LP on Mainnet. The FRAX LP gets reimbursed by sending the original FRAX from the Arbitrum deposit box through the canonical bridge back to Mainnet. So the relayer is doing 2-hr loans and the LP is doing 7-day loans. This is the reason why the relayer needs less funds. A relayer has to be able to support Frax’s largest single transfer whereas the LP needs to have enough liquidity to support 7 days of transfers.\n\nProposal\n1. Set up a relayer with 250K of $FRAX tokens.\n2. Set up and fund a liquidity pool with 500k-750k $FRAX.\n3. Review period after 3 months.\n",

This proposal could potential help Frax investors to unlock their assets without losing any interest and maximize their yield.\n\n### Background\n\nLend Flare is a decentralized borrowing platform on Ethereum blockchain that allows Curve LP holders (the borrowers) to draw fixed-rate, fixed term and high LTV loans against Curve LP used as collateral, with no concerns for assets being liquidated due to price fluctuation. Loans are paid out through Lend Flare from Compound platform. Liquidity providers (the lenders) who deposit loan liquidity through Lend Flare on Compound platform will receive one of the highest interest rate compared to other current lending platforms.\n\n### Motivation \n\nFrax has recently become one of the most influential stable coin in the market. Currently around 2876m sitting in Curve gauge. With Lend Flare, frax3crv holders can collacterize their assets in Lend Flare and borrow other stables against it without losing any Convex yield. With these borrowed stables, LP holders can reinvest in Curve gauge and further maximize your interest. Loops start. For details \n\n![50021649772390_.pic.jpg](ipfs://QmdoHFv4HtZLjA1djwPoGhKvDMeyTJCrcTs39EP4ttxhuD)\n\nWith upcoming 4 pools, Lend Flare could help those who originally hold 3crv base and metapool LPs and further participating in 4 pool investment. Another loop.\n\n### Future Partnership Plan\n1. Adopt Frax as Lend Flare supplied asset.  In other words, you can borrow Frax against corresponded Curve LP.\n2. A FRAX DAO <> Lend Flare DAO swap of FXS<>LFT and permanently lock each other's tokens to align incentives.\n3. For Lend Flare v2, we will create a synthetic assets LFUSD and pair with Frax in Curve which further create loop for our loan suppliers.\n\n\n### Reference\n\nLend Flare Official Website: https://lendflare.finance\nLend Flare Docs: https://en-docs.lendflare.finance/\nLend Flare Audit Report: https://www.certik.com/projects/lend-flare\n\n**For:** Lend Flare is a low risk, high LTV lending platform which could serve Frax community and help Frax grow.\n\n**Against:** Lend Flare is still young. We have confidence that one day Lend Flare will become one of the most trustable and influencial partners for Frax.\n\n\n### Author\nLend Flare team",

Built from the team behind UMA, its unique implementation of relayers and liquidity pools allow it to boast itself as the fastest and cheapest bridge for token bridging.\n\nThe Ethereum ecosystem is currently plagued by high fees and usage is uneconomical for most participants. The rollup ecosystem (collectively known as L2s) is robust and growing immensely - its promise of scale and keeping transactions fees low means that they will eventually dominate usage over L1 mainnet and thus we need to think of the future where many (if not most) projects will be based on some of these L2 chains.\n\nFRAX is currently ranked 6 on the Coingecko Stablecoins category with a market cap of about $2.9B, and is one of the largest decentralized algorithmic stablecoin projects on Ethereum behind DAI. To ensure its leadership position and to remain competitive, FRAX should become one of the most liquid assets on as many chains as possible. Complementary to other token bridging solutions, having FRAX be accessible across many different bridging platforms minimizes centralization risk.\n\nThis is where Across comes in - we plan to provide some of the necessary backend infrastructure to allow FRAX to be transferred quickly and as cheaply as possible across supported chains. Efficient and positive usage will allow Across to further its mission and deepen its relationship, and to scale up liquidity. In the near future, there will be potential to incentivize FRAX LP on Across which would further drive demand higher for FRAX. \n\nSpecification\nTo create a system for bridging FRAX using Across for fast, low cost bridging requires 2 components.\n\nThe first component is to set up a ‘relayer’. Risk Labs (UMA) would be working with the FRAX team to demonstrate how a relayer can be set up with the intent that the FRAX team will run the relayer themselves; alternatively, FRAX could lend 250k $FRAX to Risk Labs to run a relayer on behalf of the FRAX team. Risk Labs will not charge Frax Finance for any costs of running the relayer for at least 3 months.\n\nThe second component is the liquidity pool. This would constitute funding the liquidity pool with 500k-750k $FRAX as a reasonable amount to start with. If all goes well, we anticipate expanding significantly in a subsequent snapshot based on Across demand. \n\nExample Transaction & Mechanics\nBob wants to move 100,000 FRAX from Arbitrum to Mainnet. He puts it into a deposit box in Arbitrum. The relayer sees that deposit and fronts the FRAX to him on Mainnet. After a 2hr dispute period, the relayer gets reimbursed by the FRAX LP on Mainnet. The FRAX LP gets reimbursed by sending the original FRAX from the Arbitrum deposit box through the canonical bridge back to Mainnet. So the relayer is doing 2-hr loans and the LP is doing 7-day loans. This is the reason why the relayer needs less funds. A relayer has to be able to support Frax’s largest single transfer whereas the LP needs to have enough liquidity to support 7 days of transfers.\n\nProposal\n1. Set up a relayer with 250K of $FRAX tokens.\n2. Set up and fund a liquidity pool with 500k-750k $FRAX.\n3. Review period after 3 months.\n\nFor: Set up a relayer and fund the liquidity pool to bootstrap Across.\n\nAgainst: Do nothing",

      "content": "As we all know it will soon be time for the “BIG 3” to be added to the FRAX ecosystem.\n\nFPI (including the FPIS airdrop)\nFRAXlend\nFRAXswap\n\nAnd this is something the team and us investors have been excited about for months.\n\nIn this thread i would like to put forward the idea of creating a budget that the team may use to help attract early investors and maybe even early users of the FRAXswap platform when it goes live.\n\nI would like to propose we give the team permission to mint up to an additional 500,000 FXS (around $17.5m at today’s prices) to create a budget that could be used to help attract liquidity and users to FRAXswap in its first few months after launch.\n\nIf this budget gets voted in then the team will have permission to use the budget any way they choose as long as its being used to help FRAXswap gain liquidity and/or users.\n\nSome examples of how the budget could be used are.\n\naddition FXS rewards for early LP stakers, tapering off over a few months.\n\na random airdrop with a snapshot taken in the first few months and LP stakers getting rewarded.\n\nearly users are added to the airdrop.\n\nthe budget could be used to reward people that help promote the big 3.\n\nthis budget could fund a twitter giveaway, “retweet this post and 5 people will win 100 FXS”.\n\nwe could reward the first few protocols that trade on FRAXswap and post about it on twitter.\n\nI would like to point out that if this does go to vote and it does pass then the team can still choose to veto it and there is nothing forcing them to carry out any action if they feel no action is needed.\n\nMy reasons for thinking a budget is needed is pretty simple. FRAXswap is built for large whales and protocols to use when they are doing large token swap. For them to be able to do this from day 1 we will need to have a good amount of liquidity. So we need to hit the ground running and be able to provide a service to the bigger investors from the start.\n\nMy second reason is, we are about to hand out a big chunk of $FPIS to investors (including other protocols) and i feel many investors are simply looking to sell and move on, but if we give them an attractive location to stake their $FPIS which maybe has another airdrop or increased rewards then its more likely that $FPIS holders will just stake their airdropped coins which in turn increases the liquidity for the few that still want to sell.\n\nWe only get one chance to launch FRAXswap and I want the team to have every tool they may need to make it a go as well as possible. \n\nFOR = allocate 500,000 FXS to FRAXswap launch budget.\n\nAGAINST = do nothing.

Olympus has always focused around mutually beneficial protocol interactions, it’s in the (3,3) culture. To date Olympus has created deep liquidity with FRAX at a depth of 6M, aided in POL for Frax Finance through Olympus Pro (Total Bonded Value of 5M) and utilizes FRAX as Risk Free Value for the protocol (33M in reserves). This partnership continued with a DAO swap (OIP-53 Execute DAO Swap with Frax Finance 2) and the acceptance of Olympus being able to stake its FXS tokens (FIP-38 Whitelist OlympusDAO to Stake veFXS 3). Without hesitation Olympus locked for maximum duration, 4 years.\n\nOlympusDAO would like to continue this close relationship through addition of the OHM-FRAX LP on Uniswap v3 as a gauge on the Frax Finance platform. Olympus wants to continue to gain its exposure to the Frax Finance ecosystem.\n\nBenefits of this Gauge:\n1.) OlympusDAO is a whitelisted protocol that can stake veFXS so it will bolster Olympus’ holdings FXS and will continue to lock FXS supply away.\n2.) Continue to grow our already successful partnership as Frax Finance continue to innovate.\n3.) In the future Olympus will be able to offer benefits to partners driving TVL to Frax Finance.\n\nProposal:\nAdd OHM-FRAX Uni v3 Gauge\n",

This proposal will formalize the collaboration with a $3m token swap and the creation of a $8m long term AMM liquidity pool, which will include $4m of FRAX.\n\n### Background and Motivation\nFrax is preparing for the next phase of expansion. FPI, Fraxswap and native lending markets are all on the horizon.\n\nFutureswap (https://www.futureswap.com/ 5 ) is a decentralized non-custodial perpetual protocol where users can gain leveraged exposure on assets. Futureswap is live on Arbitrum and plans to expand to other chains in the coming weeks. More information about Futureswap can be found here 3.\n\nFutureswap is working to provide a layer of derivative products on top of the Frax ecosystem. The Futureswap team is already assisting with Fraxswap and will be one of the first products to utilize Fraxswap once it is live. Some of the possible applications include leveraged exposure for pairs listed on Fraxswap, including leveraged exposure to inflation via FPI. Futureswap also plans on building products for Frax’s native lending markets.\n\nThere is tremendous potential for Futureswap and Frax to enable great markets together. The vision is for Futureswap to provide a derivative layer on top of Frax on all relevant chains. As we begin this effort, now is a great time to execute a token swap to align interests and benefit from mutual protocol growth going forward. The proposed swap amount is $3m of FXS for $3m of FST at a 30-day TWAP.\n\nThis proposal also authorizes the creation of an $8m long term FST/FRAX AMM pool, with Frax contributing $4m FRAX and Futureswap contributing $4m FST. This pool is designed to create a long term market for FST priced in FRAX with both protocols as equal owners of the LP positions.\n\nThis proposal is only for the approval of a $3m token swap and $4m FRAX for the AMM pool. The next phase of the collaboration will likely include Frax providing liquidity on Futureswap. This will be addressed in a future proposal.\n\n### Proposal\nAuthorize a $3m FXS swap for $3m FST at a 30-day TWAP and up to $4m FRAX for a long term FST/FRAX AMM pool to be jointly owned by both protocols.\n___________________________________________\n### For: Authorize the swap and creation of the AMM pool\n### Against: Do nothing",

This proposal will authorize Frax comptrollers to deploy up to $50m of FRAX liquidity at their discretion once FRAX is live on Hop.\n\n### Background and Motivation\nThe previous proposal for the Hop AMO laid the groundwork for FRAX to be onboarded to Hop. Ideally this will occur in the coming weeks. In order to onboard FRAX, Frax will need to run a bonder to provide liquidity for FRAX transactions. This proposal will fund the bonder, which will be maintained by Frax comptrollers and earn fees for the Frax protocol. Frax can also seed liquidity in FRAX AMM pools on Hop. Frax will have access to all funds deployed and be able to increase or decrease funding at the discretion of the comptrollers. The end goal is to make FRAX the most attractive asset to use on L2 and the best option to bridge between L1<>L2 and L2<>L2.\n\nWith regards to the size of the proposal, the goal of the proposal is to give comptrollers the ability to provide enough liquidity to make FRAX a compelling option while also generating revenue for the protocol.

      "content": "Discussion therad:\nhttps://gov.frax.finance/t/fip-48-dynamic-buyback-recollateralize-functions/773\n\n## Summary\n\nMake the buyback & recollateralize functions 2 dynamically toggle when peg is below/above 1.0033 & .9966\n\n## Background & Motivation:\n\nThe FRAX peg has been practically unshakable and I’d like to suggest some improvements for both performance of both protocol functionality as well as FXS value accrual. Right now, per FIP 6 rules 4, the CR is changed periodically if the peg has not changed. This has been the case for many many months. I can’t recall when the peg has shifted even by a single 1/3rd of a cent. This proposal is to modify the Frax buyback/recollateralize function rules so that they are only activated when the peg deviates by 1/3rd of a cent between 1.0033 and .9966. This is for a few reasons: the protocol is extremely stable at CRs in this range and the CR adjustments occur much less frequently per FIP 6 rules. Secondly, large recollateralize functions mint a very large amount of FXS into circulation dramatically increasing the emission rate of FXS when it does not directly aid in any stability performing function. For example, just this week, over 50,000 FXS has been minted from recollateralize functions which almost has tripled the emission rate of FXS this week. That is a 300% inflation rate increase. If it was aiding in the stability of the protocol due to even slight peg deviation, that would be extremely valuable but as can be seen from the oracle price, the FRAX peg is at 1.000.\n\nRegardless, there might come a day(s) when the peg price is deviating by more than 33% of 1 cent. This range is minimal but if this deviation occurs, this is exactly when the protocol will turn on buyback/recollateralize dependent on the CR and the direction of the peg to perform its core stabilizing function and bring the CR to target to restore confidence in the peg. I think this is a completely conservative and non-controversial improvement to the protocol which helps FXS value accrual by not causing excessive mints of FXS while also making sure it is possible to recollateralize if needed.\n________________________________\n### For: Make Buyback/Recollateralize dynamic to peg price\n\n### Against: Do nothing",

Convex creates a bot that watches for new Frax proposals. When a proposal is created, Convex creates a matching proposal for its users to vote on)\n\nChange 2:\nIncrease minimum proposal vote period to 5 days.\nDecrease minimum forum discussion period to 3 days.\n\nReasoning:\nDAO or other groups need to have time to complete their own local voting process before submitting to the official Frax proposal, thus more time should be allowed.\n(Longer voting periods can also help with quorum and discussions)\n\nConcerning the forum discussion period, Sam from the Frax team suggested keeping an 8 day proposal window by lowering the forum discussion. The total period to discuss and vote will remain the same.\n\nChange 3:\nChange all votes from “Single Choice Voting” to “Weighted Voting”.\n\nReasoning:\nThis allows users to spread their vote weight across multiple answers. For a single user this might not affect their choice but for DAOs and other groups this gives them the option to spread their vote to better reflect the result of their own user base.",

      "title": "Sifchain <> Frax Partnership",
      "content": "Summary:\nThis proposal seeks to establish a partnership between Sifchain and Frax. If it passes, $2,000,000 FRAX will be used to provision liquidity on Sifchain. Deep Liquidity on Sifchain will establish a gateway into the Cosmos ecosystem for FRAX, make FRAX transferable over IBC, and eventually enable FRAX to be used as collateral in margin trading positions against any token bridged to by Sifchain’s omni-EVM bridge.   \nContext:\nAfter discussing a potential partnership with Frax on the community forums and receiving support from active Frax community members (https://gov.frax.finance/t/sifchain-frax-collaboration-for-deep-liquidity-in-cosmos/752), the Sifchain community has decided to bring this proposal to a formal vote. Please read the linked thread for more resources including bridge audits, tokenomics clarifications, and other concerns.\n  \nAbout Sifchain  :\nSifchain is a Cosmos SDK built DEX. Our primary value proposition is that we enable capital efficient cross-chain trading through two features: omni-EVM and deep margin. Other interesting aspects of Sifchain include our use of slip-based swap fees, eventual order-book implementation, and having ROWAN as a base pair for all pools.\n\nOmni-EVM: Sifchain aims to be the first Omni-Chain DEX, connecting to 20–25 blockchains for cross-chain integration. The targeted blockchains represent the overwhelming majority of all cryptocurrency trading volume - thus actively traded assets from all chains will be accessed through the Sifchain DEX. Omni-EVM will enable any ERC20 token, any Cosmos Token, and any token that exists on ANY EVM compatible blockchain to be imported and traded in Sifchain.\n\nDeep Margin: Hopefully coming as soon as Q2, Sifchain will deploy its novel architecture for margin trading - allowing traders to use leverage on their trades by borrowing from the liquidity pool. The interest rate is set based on market demand and liquidity supply. Liquidity providers are able to add liquidity into Sifchain’s pools symmetrically or asymmetrically, while MEV front-running in order placements is prevented through a commitment-reveal scheme.\n\nDeep Margin + Omni-EVM: Any ERC20 token or Cosmos Network token will be able to be used as collateral in any margin trading position. Likewise, any such token can be longed or shorted. This unlocks nearly unlimited margin trading pairs and enables users to utilize this feature on tokens that have previously never been possible.  \n\nTechnical Details:\n Following the standards outlined in [https://docs.frax.finance/cross-chain/bridge], FRAX on Sifchain will not be the canonical representation of FRAX, and as such it will be called sifFRAX when traveling over IBC (Cosmos’s Inter-blockchain Communication Protocol). \n\n  Proposal Results:\n  For: establish a partnership with Sifchain and provision $2,000,000 (2 Million Dollars) of FRAX liquidity on Sifchain. \n  Against: do nothing \n\n Execution  :\nOur market maker will work with the relevant members of the FRAX community to provision the initial liquidity for the pool. If a canonical version of FRAX is deployed at any time, Sifchain will work with the FRAX team to ensure that token fungibility between bridged assets and canonical assets is achieved to the satisfaction of both parties.  \n\n",

      "content": "Summary\nAdd a veFXS gauge for FRAX-VST Arbitrum Curve pool.\n\nBackground & Motivation:\nVesta Finance is a general purpose lending-stablecoin system based loosely on Liquity’s trove model. Vesta Finance is launching their native VST stablecoin and protocol on Arbitrum imminently. Liquity’s model has been very successful but due to Liquity’s lack of governance and inability to update any kind of parameters, they cannot do anything. Vesta fills this gap as a much more general purpose and exciting lending system. They have expressed interest in also expanding their lending model to include FXS and other FRAX friendly tokens.\n\nWe’d like to propose to help incentivize and create deep liquidity for VST-FRAX at launch so the projects are aligned in every way. Vesta has also committed to doing VSTA incentives for this gauge so this would be a dual token FXS+VSTA rewards gauge. This gauge would also help our Arbitrum expansion, so I think it is a net positive in multiple areas.\n\nFor: Deploy FRAX-VST Gauge\nAgainst: Do nothing",

      "title": "Frax analytics and protocol expansion grant",
      "content": "TL;DR\nGrant for a team of 2 devs to do the following:\nBuild a detailed analytics dashboard for Frax that tracks protocol owned assets, earnings, usage metrics, and others, across all chains Frax is deployed\nGather information and propose improvements to how the protocol allocates its treasury in order to increase profit and maximize Frax use cases\nPropose new gauge pools and improvements to its allocation in order to maximize growth of Frax usage\nBuild an information site to display the partnerships Frax has made, how much has been spent on each, DAO-swapped FXS in case it happened and how they are using their FXS, etc.\nHave a more active conversation on Governance Discussion with protocols that seek partnerships with Frax and provide reports on benefits and risks\nSeek new partnerships and recommend possible investments in protocols that would help Frax expansion and use cases\nProposal\n1. Analytics dashboard\nTreasury and protocol owned value management are fundamental for a DAO to work. First step of how to properly do this is to have an accurate account of it, currently Frax has two sources of this: the Dune dashboard 2 and the AMOs dashboard. The Dune dashboard has several problems, it is not useful for multi-chain information, has little interactivity, and available graphs are limited, in its favor we can say that is displays information over time. The AMOs dashboard improves in multi-chain information, but does not provide a good understanding of the data over time. Besides, there is a lot of additional information that should be measured, such as how much of the circulating Frax is owned by the protocol, what are the assets and liquidity deployed on DEXes, what are the volumes on those pools, how much the deployed funds are making and have made over time, what is the Frax volume, how much of the Frax is locked in bridges, and more.\nFor these reasons, and others, such as an absolute transparency and ease of understanding, we think that more efforts on tracking the protocol holdings should be made and we request for a grant to build an in-depth dashboard for this, along with additional information such as Frax usage.\n\n2. Suggestions for treasury allocation\nCurrently the protocol has liquidity and assets supplied across several markets, although it is questionable how each particular pool contributes to the protocol. What we would like to seek is to maximize the profits and use cases each deployment provides for Frax, but in a lot of cases it is really negligible. For example, if we look at the Uniswap V3 pools:\n\nCaptura de Pantalla 2022-01-31 a la(s) 15.10.06\nCaptura de Pantalla 2022-01-31 a la(s) 15.10.06\n2360×1140 188 KB\nOf these pools, the protocol controls the 9m in the USDT pool, the 5m in the LUSD pool, the 4.75m in the sUSD pool, the 2.34m in the RAI pool and the 1.5m in the UST pool. As we can see the volume on these pools is very low, which makes us wonder if and how could we make a better use of these funds.\nOne of the tasks of this grant will be to analyze and seek to improve how treasury funds are allocated.\n\n3. Propose new pool gauges and emissions\nAs we also see in the above picture of Uni V3 pools, around 260m are deposited in the USDC and DAI pools, but they present very low volume, as a comparison, the 1bps DAI/USDC has 234m TVL with 330m 7-day volume, and the 1bps USDC/USDT has 186m TVL and 1b 7-day volume. Although it may not be a completely on par comparison, the objective of FXS should be to compensate for users that are taking a risk (like the FXS/FRAX pool) or provide a usage of Frax (like the StakeDAO ETH-Put Strategy). Neither is the case for the deposits on the FRAX/USDC and DAI/FRAX pools, based on the low volume of those pools, and the fact that the current risk of Frax loosing it’s peg its 0.\nFor this reason, we think that seeking for ways to improve the gauge FXS emissions in order to increase the Frax usage is very important, and will be one of the objectives of this grant.\n\n4. DAO Partneship Information\nFrax has invested in several protocols, such as TempleDAO, OlympusDAO, OndoFinance, and performed treasury swaps with some others like LOBIS or Tokemak. We propose to build and interface to show the status of this partnerships, such as how much the protocol has invested, how it is being used, and how the other protocols are using their FXS if they have.\n\n5 and 6. Frax partnerships\nSeveral protocols have reached out to Frax in order to propose partnerships, but we have seen in some cases that they have received little attention, such as the IdleDAO team. We aim to build better conversations with some of the protocols and provide reports of possible benefits and risks for the Frax community in order to keep them informed, not just taking someone words for it, and make better decissions. Also, we propose keep an eye out for possible new partnerships or investments that could be beneficial for Frax. (Important to note that to make a good work in this, time is of essence, for this reason, the amount of protocols to be reviewed are limited at 3 or 4 per month, left at the devs discretion)\n\nPlanning\nWe think this is a very ambitious proposal, for this reason reason we request funds for 2 devs, Seba will be the main face behind the proposal and has a pre-agreement with an additional dev. This proposal is intended to provide funds for at least two months. Work on the Frax Analytics Dashboard will begin immediately and we expect to have a public, possibly incomplete, version in February. Points 2,3,5 and 6 will also begin immediately and concurrently. Point 4 will be less of a priority and work on it will be based on devs criterion, time availability and, in case of a high Frax community demand, may be prioritized.\n\nCompensation\nBased on the size of this proposal and how much it can contribute to Frax, we think that a grant of $4k in Frax and $4k in FXS, the latter vested for 6 months as standard, per dev per month, is a fair compensation (although we understand possible concerns about this and are open to a negotiation). Also, based on my current experience with the Dune dashboard, I think it would be fair to value each FXS at the minimum between the 14-day and 30-day average at the time of payment, due to high price variance. Finally, payment will be done in three steps, an initial payment of $4k Frax at the beginning of the work for each dev, after the first month $4k Frax + $4k in FXS, and after the 2 months the remaining $4k in FXS for each dev. After the 2 months, the continuation of the grant and agreement will be open to renegotiation.\n\nI hope you guys can also agree that this is an important work for Frax, beginning to work on our data can be very helpfup (as MakerDAO is 2), and please share any questions, concerns, additions, etc. you have about this proposal.\n\nProposed by.\nSeba and Aidan\n\nFOR = Approve grant \nAGAINST = Do nothing ",

      "content": "Summary\nActivate cross-chain AMO and deploy Frax liquidity to dForce Lending (both on Ethereum and on Arbitrum), unlocking an alt¬¬¬ernative venue for Frax AMO to earn passive yields on Frax and USDC reserves.\n \nBackground \ndForce is building a comprehensive set of DeFi protocols covering assets, lending, trading, serving as layer 0 infrastructure in Web 3. dForce is currently deployed on Ethereum, Arbitrum, Optimism, and BSC with a TVL of over $400m. It is currently one of the largest lending protocols on Arbitrum and BSC in terms of TVL.\ndForce Lending has undergone extensive code reviews and security audits by Trail of Bits, ConsenSys Diligence, CertiK, Certora (formal verification), with a bug bounty launched through Immunefi. dForce lending protocol has withstood a number of market downturn and is battle-tested with more than one year of operation on-chain. \nForum discussion: https://gov.frax.finance/t/partnership-with-dforce-to-accelerate-multi-chain-expansion/368 \n\nAbstract\nThis proposal aims to expand Frax’s multi-chain liquidity and community through a partnership with dForce. We believe this integration demonstrates strong synergies between the two communities, and can help to further expand the utilization of Frax on different layers and chains.\nAs a blockchain agnostic protocol aiming to provide underlying DeFi infrastructure powering the development of Web 3, dForce pertains to the ability to interact with differing protocols in various environment, giving users the freedom of choice to change between blockchains. \nFrax has proved its success with impressive growth since its launch, but in order to fulfil its vision as a decentralized currency, we believe it’s crucial for Frax to build influence far and wide in the lending market, one of the largest vehicles inside the DeFi space. \nAs a start, dForce announced lending support to Frax on Ethereum and Arbitrum, allowing users to borrow Frax against its supported assets.\nWe hope to build a solid partnership with Frax community to accelerate the multi-chain expansion for both in a way that benefit both communities meaningfully.\n\nMotivation\n•\tRevenue: unlocking an alternative venue for Frax AMO to earn passive yields on Frax and possibly USDC reserves.\n•\tExposure: dForce is one of the largest lending protocols in terms of TVL on Arbitrum and BSC. We believe dForce’s support can help Frax to consolidate and strengthen its foothold as a leading decentralized currency.\n•\tExpansion: dForce is currently deployed on Ethereum, Arbitrum, Optimism, BSC, and can facilitate faster expansion of Frax to multiple chains and layers. \n\nProposal\nIt is proposed to deploy AMO with Frax liquidity (Ethereum and Arbitrum) to dForce Lending, further enhancing Frax’s ability to interact with other DeFi applications and assets in a meaningful way (i.e., supply wstETH or UNI or to borrow Frax). \n\nPoll\n•\tFor – Deploy AMO to dForce Lending\n•\tAgainst – Do nothing. \n",

      "content": "Governance discussion thread: \nhttps://gov.frax.finance/t/fip-44-hop-amo/731\n\n### Author\nHameed\n\n### Summary\n\nCreate a Hop AMO to provide liquidity directly to the Hop protocol.\n\n### Background and Motivation\n\nHop (https://hop.exchange/) is a scalable rollup-to-rollup general token bridge built on Ethereum. Hop lets users to send tokens from one rollup to another almost immediately without having to wait for the rollup’s challenge period.\n\nEthereum’s Layer 2 (L2 - rollups that utilize the Ethereum main chain for security) will likely become synonymous with “Ethereum” in the not distant future. Currently the most feature rich rollups are Optimistic rollups, which have a seven day withdraw period for assets exiting L2. Hop offers near instant withdrawals for users exiting L2, which will be critical for the widespread adoption of L2 on Ethereum. Hop also offers the best trust assumptions of existing bridges.\n\nAs we plan the next phase of growth for Frax, FRAX should become one of the most liquid assets on L2. I propose that Frax create a Hop AMO to provide liquidity directly to Hop to help achieve this goal. Deployed liquidity will earn a yield on Hop, creating a win / win situation for Frax and Hop. If the vision of Hop is achieved, it will become a quasi public good that serves as the connective tissue between L1<>L2 and L2<>L2. Frax can help Hop realize this vision and onboard more users to L2, which also helps Ethereum scale.\n\n### Phases\n\nIn the near term, Frax can provide stablecoin liquidity (likely USDC / DAI in the short term) for both Hop AMMs and bonding (bonded capital enables fast withdrawals on Hop). We can authorize up to $20m of liquidity in this proposal which we can scale up to over time. If all goes well, I anticipate expanding the AMO significantly in a subsequent snapshot based on Hop demand. In this phase, any bonding will be done in cooperation with the Hop team and the optimal structure and sizing will be determined collaboratively. This is an opportunity for Frax to support Hop and Ethereum scaling by providing liquidity while also earning a return on protocol owned assets.\n\nThe first phase is the extent of this proposal. If all goes well with the AMO and the community is on-board with further collaboration, the next obvious step is to work to add Frax to Hop and supply FRAX (and perhaps FPI) liquidity to Hop. The AMO can deploy large amounts of Frax to make it the most liquid and cost-efficient asset to bridge Ethereum L1<>L2 and L2<>L2.\n\n### Proposal\n Create a Hop AMO and authorize up to $20m of liquidity for use in the AMO.\n\n### For: Create the Hop AMO\n### Against: Do nothing",

Once voting is complete the team have the rest of the month to complete the purchase\n\nI see this as a good way to add to our holdings, increase the power of FXS and veFXS voting and give smaller FXS holders a chance to be included (as voting is free). It also gives more value to having a FRAX partnership or DAO-DAO swap as it would then mean the other protocol will be added to the monthly asset Acquisition vote.\n\nThe more value FXS controls the more value the FXS is worth ,  right now it controls the FRAX emissions, with this in place it could also control a small amount of the protocol's operating profits too. \n\nFOR = make it happen\n\nAGAINST  = do nothing",

      "title": "FIP 43 - FRAX <> RenaissanceDAO Partnership",
      "content": "TLDR\n\nRenaissanceDAO partners with FRAX to bridge FRAX liquidity to Aurora.\n\nSUMMARY\n\nRenaissanceDAO will create an ART-FRAX pool and allow bonding with FRAX to users. Once enough liquidity has built up in the ART-FRAX pool, we want to extend this partnership through AMOs. FRAX expansions are sent to this AMO to purchase and stake $ART. The AMO will increase FRAX’s balance sheet and improve ART-FRAX liquidity. RenaissanceDAO benefits from accumulating stable coins in the early stages and presents a creative investment opportunity for FRAX to provide liquidity in the NFT market. The purpose of the Renaissance <> FRAX partnership is to grow algorithmic stablecoins into Defi and NFT markets together.\n\nWHY FRAX <> RENAISSANCE?\n\nThe RenaissanceDAO is an upcoming community-driven project designed to drive innovation in NFT ownership by utilizing the time-tested foundation of OHM’s reserve currency on Aurora . To date, we are a community of twenty eight-thousands, who rally behind the convergence of art, blockchain technology, and autonomy via decentralization.\n\nOur vision is to create and own the largest decentralized NFT liquidity pools, using DeFi primitives, that facilitate trading of fractionalized NFTs. We believe that this approach lowers existing barriers-to-entry for numerous market participants who are currently unable to interact with “blue-chip” NFTs, which continue to highlight the strong negative correlation between risk and price in the NFT ecosystem. In this sense, fractionalization allows buyers to allocate their funds to safer assets—positions that can be entered and exited with ease via designated liquidity pools.\n\nRenaissance’s token, $ART, is built to accelerate and aggregate investment into the digital art space. Proceeds from issuances of $ART tokens are funneled into purchasing NFT collections, decided by the community of tokenholders. Overtime, as the Treasury begins to amass a collection of NFTs, the expectation is for the $ART token to act as an index token of all the underlying digital art assets.\n\nTECHNICAL DETAILS\n\nDAO governed NFT purchases - 20% of bond profits are allocated to the NFT treasury. These funds will be used for NFT purchases that are directed by active community voting at each epoch. The ability to participate in governance will be obtained through staking, and all votes will be obscured through zero knowledge proof until the NFT purchase has completed.\n\nFractionalized NFT liquidity pool / decentralized NFT exchange - Purchased NFTs from the treasury will be fractionalized and listed for internal IDOs (stakers only) to establish liquidity pools, which can be utilized by any user to freely trade the fractionalized shares through our NFT-Automated Market Maker (AMM).\n\nRenaissance DAO has chosen and will continue to use FRAX as the predominant and first stablecoin to be used in the treasury. We fully support the innovation, vision, and community of FRAX.",

      "title": "Allocate up to $10m worth of FXS to Votium for the bi-weekly Convex Gauge-Weight Vote",
      "content": "## Authors\nJason Huan, Dennis, Sam Kazemian\n\n## Summary:\nThe previous December 9th Convex Votium bribe snapshot continuously allocated up to $5m worth of FXS per week for the bi-weekly Convex Gauge-Weight Vote to bribe for the FRAX3CRV gauge on Votium. As the gauges have become more competitive recently, with an expected increase in bribe amounts from other protocols, we are proposing to increase the bribe up to $10m worth of FXS at comptroller discretion. Note that this is simply the maximum amount, and not necessarily the exact amount that will be bribed on Votium.\n\n## Background & Motivation:\nThe Curve pool gauge-weight vote is voted on by veCRV holders, of which Convex holds roughly half the circulating supply. Convex allows holders of vlCVX (vote-locked CVX) to vote on how the platform's veCRV should be allocated.\n\nVotium allows for anyone to create a bribe for vlCVX holders for a specific gauge, claimable upon voting in Convex's bi-weekly snapshot allocation.\n\nFrax currently has 35.5% of Convex's entire veCRV amount in the Curve gauge-weight vote, up from 28.8% three periods ago. Convex's veCRV gauge allocation is re-weighted every other week, with the current vote ending on January 24th. To defend our allocation, we propose increasing the bribes to up to $10m worth of FXS at comptroller discretion. Rewards from increased gauge APR will be distributed across all FXS holders due to FXS1559 buying back FXS with protocol profit.\n\nAs this has been on onging allocation, the change would carry forward to future Convex gauge weight voting periods.\n\nFor: Approve allocation\nAgainst: Do nothing",

      "content": "Forum discussion: https://gov.frax.finance/t/bootstrap-lobis-partnership-with-token-swap/525\n\nUpdate since proposal:\n- Lobis kept locking its FXS on a weekly basis\n- Lobis votes for the Frax reactor on Tokemak with 100% of its TOKE holdings (top 10 holder)\n- Lobis market bought c.$10m worth of FXS\n- LOBI is trading below its backing value, and backing is made of FXS, TOKE, CRV, SDT, ANGLE and OHM, only high quality asset that should give comfort on the limited risk of this token swap (treasury composition here: https://app.lobis.finance/#/dashboard)\n\n\nSummary:\nSwap $1m worth of FXS from community multisig at a 7 day TWAP price for $1m worth of LOBI at 7 day TWAP price.\n\nBackground & Motivation:\nLobis is a huge supporter of Frax and has been market buying FXS since it went live.\nWe started locking our FXS and built an infrastructure enabling the Lobis community to take part in Frax’s governance and start building bridges betweet the two community.\nTo strengthen our partnership and build it for the long term, we believe that it is important that Frax also has its say in Lobis’ governance.\nTherefore, we suggest doing a $1m token swap between LOBI and FXS.\n\nFXS owned by Lobis will be either directly locked or go through a locker (or any other way it could be useful to Frax).\n\nWith the LOBI it owns, Frax will be able to vote on Tokemak’s gauge for liquidity direction, and eventually on Curve gauges. It will also be able to vote on Lobis’ governance, including for policy matters such as the rate of acquisition of FXS. Finally, it will also have a word at how Lobis votes on Frax governance, which is healthy.\n\nThis vote is only for the DAO to DAO swap but would be a good first step for a broader partnership between the two protocols.\n\nChoices:\n1 - Do a $1m token swap LOBI/FXS\n2 - Do up to 5 $200k token swaps (maximum one every other week)\n3 - Amend and resubmit\n4 - Don't do anything",

      "title": "FIP 42 - FRAX & Themis partnership",
      "content": "Summary;\nThemis is the first-ever protocol that provides borrowing & lending for the AMMs market starting with Uni V3 positions. For more information please check out; Website 9, Twitter 1, Docs 1\n\nTL;DR;\nThemis allows users who have a liquidity position with Uniswap v3 to collateralize up to 65% of their LP assets.\n\nThis means that if you have $10k in LP assets, you could receive up to $6500 in stablecoins like FRAX to do with as you will. Buy Lambo, go long on Shiba Inu, reinvest right back into your LP, who cares?\n\nA good example would be the FRAX/USDC LP pair, users are able to collateralize their LP and borrow up to 65% in supported stables coins like FRAX and other whitelisted assets, which makes the current FRAX/USDC pair at least 165% more capital efficient.\n\nThe success factor of any stablecoin derives from 3 things; community, liquidity, and adoption. The Frax community is no doubt one of the most forward thinking communities out there. You guys are building what will become the future of modern central banking. Themis wants to partner with you guys and allow you to increase your liquidity and adoption.\n\nPotential roadblocks/risks for the Frax community;\n\nSmart contract risks of being exploited. – Our smart contract and business logic have been audited by a reputable 3rd party. Also, we will soon be launching a bounty program with Immunefi.\n\nBorrowers default; risk of default. – We will be whitelisting selected V3 LP pairs that fit our risk model of liquidity, reputation, and volatility to ensure the safety of our lenders. Our liquidation kicks in at 80% ensuring that our borrowers are always over collateralized at any given time. There is minimal risk of being liquidated however, a full or partial repayment back to the loan contract can be made at any time to lower this percentage.\n\nThemis is a new protocol that is currently bootstrapping its lending liquidity. And, it’s a great way for the AMO to earn organic interest but also Themis’ governance tokens without risk of impermanent loss or volatility.\n\nWith that said, we’re applying for $10m to kickstart the protocol. All funds will be locked via smart contract for 9 months.  \n\n",

MAI is backed by a basket of assets, ranging from stable assets to volatile assets. The following tokens hold the largest shares of collateral for MAI: WETH (23%), MATIC (19%), and WBTC (15%). There is no USDC backing MAI at the time of writing.\n\nMAI can currently be minted on 5 chains and can be bridged to 12 chains, with a TVL of $150M.\n\n## Partnership details:\n* QiDao adds FXS as collateral for MAI. This will allow users to mint MAI stablecoins at 0% interest against their FXS (while maintaining ownership of their FXS). Approving FXS as collateral on Polygon will approve it as collateral on all chains where MAI can be minted. That is currently Polygon, Fantom, Avalanche, Moonriver, and Harmony.\n* Frax mints 2M MAI at a safe LTV ratio (50%)\n* Frax creates an LP with the minted MAI and FRAX\n* QiDao will secure incentives from the DEX that LP is deployed on to maximize volume and TVL\n* Add MAI as a collateral asset for minting/redeeming FRAX natively on Polygon\n\n## Motivation:\n* FXS holders will be able to use FXS without spending it. There’s no interest cost for minting MAI against collateral.\n* FXS vaults will be eligible for MAI borrowing rewards. These rewards are decided on twice a month through a gauge voting system.\n* As QiDao continues to expand to other chains, FXS will be already whitelisted as collateral on new chains.",

      "content": "## Summary\nStake 4.5m FXS from the protocol treasury into veFXS to provide yield for protocol treasury.\n\n## Introduction\n5% of the genesis FXS supply is in the hands of the Core Team Treasury to be deployed for the sole purpose of growing the Frax Protocol to become one of the most important cryptocurrency projects in the world.\n\nIn order to achieve that mission, we propose staking 4.5m FXS in veFXS for 6 months to attain yield and allocating that yield. We will use the veFXS yield to fund expansion of the team, bringing onboard community moderators/business developers/outreach, new developers, and create the Frax Grants+Incubator Program. The remaining 500k FXS not staked will be used for similar initiatives. This allows the treasury to fund these programs regardless if veFXS yield crashes or if there is a protracted bear market, allowing the Frax Protocol to continue its mission of becoming one of the most important protocols no matter what.\n\nAfter 6 months, this exact proposal (with any modifications/adjustments) will go live for another community vote before further allocation of funds so that the project team & extended contributors are held accountable to FXS tokenholders.\n\nThe core team will NOT VOTE using the staked veFXS or treasury address so this proposal will NOT affect the team’s ability to sway governance in any way.\n\n## Background\nThe Frax Team Treasury is composed of 5m FXS. This treasury has largely been dormant for the first year of the Frax Protocol. Now that almost all FXS tokens have been released other than the community allocation through gauge emissions, we propose kickstarting the allocation of this treasury in a strategic manner to exponentially grow the pace of FRAX development & further decentralize the work, collaboration, and involvement of the extended community.\n\n## For: Deploy FXS Treasury to veFXS and fund team expansion, grants, incubator etc.\n## Against: Do nothing",

      "content": "Original forum discussion: https://gov.frax.finance/t/fip-41-frax-prometheusdao-partnership/553\n\nSummary\nPrometheusDAO is an Olympus inspired reserve currency project on Polygon with unique features (NFTs and P2E MMORPG) to be integrated with the protocol. PrometheusDAO would like to use FRAX-PRM bonds to grow protocol controlled liquidity in Frax.\n\nWhy Frax?\nThere is no shortage of reasons why Frax is the top choice, with Frax offering more than just a stable coin.\n\nFrax will enable us to provide lending and borrowing features directly to PrometheusDAO (just as MIM is to TIME, Frax will allow us to do the same). Frax is very familiar with the space, already having a pair with OlympusDAO and many others, and now joining forces with PrometheusDAO to provide Frax development on Polygon. Frax embodies the community and collaborative spirit in ways few other projects do. This is the type of culture we at PrometheusDAO strive to become as well. Having had conversations with Sam Kazemian directly, he was incredibly welcoming of the prospect of partnership and collaboration, despite us being a project in our early stages. As a result, we have deepened our respect for Sam’s commitment to furthering the space, being a mentor and a long-term partner. We are truly excited to cultivate a beneficial relationship based on trust, innovation and an unwavering dedication to our respective long-term goals.\n\nGovernment Proposal\n\nFor: Approve Bond Partnership\n\nAgainst: Do nothing",

      "content": "For whom it may concern,\n\nI am writing here regarding a marketing offer proposal. I am Marin and I am the content writer for GameFi Corner and have partnered up with a good friend of mine who has experience in marketing and e-commerce.\n\nGameFi Corner is a newsletter exclusively aimed at blockchain gaming and metaverse. We handpick the most up to date information and create content that is suitable and engaging to read.\n\nOur goal is to make GameFi a better place by making it accessible and educate everyone who is interested to make more informed decisions. We also want to collaborate with sponsors who believe in our development and positive future outcomes for everyone including the community, sponsors who partner up with us and GameFi Corner itself.\n\nWe see success when partnerships can truly benefit from one another like an interconnected chain. One provides with the sponsor, funding and in return we will contribute all our specific GameFi knowledge through extensive research and investment in paid advertisements so we can create traffic for both Frax and GameFi Corner.\n\nWe will measure our success by analysing on how many users have clicked on your link / banner we will include in our texts. The more subscribers we can bring thanks to your potential funding, the more successful we will both become. Of course we are open to hear also other proposals on how we can benefit together.\n\nWe have just started writing for 1 and a half months and collected almost 200 organic subscribers but with paid marketing we plan to reach at least 5000 subscribers in a few months. My friend has many years of experience in affiliate marketing and e-commerce ads which gives us an additional confidence boost to reach our goal.\n\nLink to our project: https://gameficorner.substack.com/\n\nYours faithfully,\nMarin",

      "content": "As originally suggested in the Governance discussion forum (https://gov.frax.finance/t/using-amo-to-fill-tokemak-frax-pair-reactor/515), Frax can drive additional $FRAX liquidity by allocating to the newly created $FRAX reactor on Tokemak. \n\nThe outline is below highlighting the logic behind the reasons for doing so:\n\nFraximalists should be familiar with Tokemak as $FXS was one of the first reactors. The team at Tokemak has built something that may solve a major problem for any protocol trying to deepen liquidity; not only can they alleviate the burden of protocols trying to manage their own liquidity, they can help cut farming emissions by a significant amount; see Alchemix example here: https://medium.com/tokemak/the-evolution-of-daos-1692509bbb41\n\nTokemak recently launched base pair reactors, which are stable coin reactors where those assets can be paired with the other token reactors to create LP pairs (i.e. FRAX + OHM). FRAX, FEI, DAI, UST, and LUSD were added to ETH and USDC base pair reactors.\n\nFrom the announcement: \"Tokemak is a kingmaker for stablecoins: the Pair asset with the most TOKE staked to it will naturally attract the most TVL for that stablecoin, thereby appointing that asset the one with the most pairings and liquidity across DeFi.\"\n\nBy being the first stablecoin to load a reactor, Frax could drive the TOKE side of the reactor’s APR up significantly, which would drive the APR higher in order to seek balance, and when TOKE is voted, those folks become Liquidity Directors and have a say in how $FRAX is deployed.\n\nFrax has $TOKE that could be voted into both the $FXS and $FRAX reactors to help direct liquidity, while earning healthy yields of $TOKE all the while.\n\nAs I believe we’ve seen with MIM, width and depth of distribution matter. Tokemak seems to have a unique solution to a widespread problem. It could help both Tokemak and Frax if we added a material amount to the $FRAX reactor which will attract TOKE.\n\n",

To do this i would like to propose the following.\n\nRight now we have a group of people controlling the governance power FRAX holds , lets call this group the “FRAX committee”. Right now all the roles in the FRAX committee are held by team members, as we just voted for them to have the voting power.\n\nI propose we have a round of voting to add 1 person to the FRAX committee thats not a team member, we can make a thread for interested investors to express their interest in taking on the role and make their case for being voted in to the FRAX committee. Once some time has passed we could then list all the interested parties in a vote and the FXS holders can vote in the person they wish to be added to the committee.\n\nEvery 3 months we can repeat the process and vote in another member until we reach the ideal number of people to run the FRAX committee.\n\nOnce we reach the ideal number we could carry on voting people in but as new people join a FRAX team member steps down from the role (the FRAX team can choose who steps down).\n\nWe then carry on voting people in until there is 1 FRAX team member left and the FRAX committee is made up of 1 team member and the people voted in.\n\nTo do this we would need to agree on the ideal number of people to have on the committee, personally i think 7 people is ideal to start with, but we may need to increase this as we gain more voting power in a wider selection of protocols. This number can be increased at a later date if needed but i feel 7 is a good starting place.\n\nWe should agree on some basic’s for all people applying for the positions.\n\nmust be able to communicate in good English\nmust be an active FRAX community member\nmust have a good understanding of FRAX’s long term goals\nmust be able to work well in a group\n\nAs before, any time the FRAX committee votes on a proposal it should be posted to the community and should be in the interest of FRAX.\n\nIf this part of the governance proposal is voted in i foresee it taking 18-24 months to play out as we have a vote every few months. The reason for this sort of time frame is stability , having a slow and steady hand over of power is much better then just changing everything in a few weeks.\n\nFOR = action the plan above\n\nAGAINST = do nothing",

      "content": "Summary\n\nPhantom DAO is an Olympus inspired treasury-backed accelerator project exclusively on Fantom with unique features built into the protocol. Phantom DAO would like to use FRAX-PHM bonds to predominantly grow protocol controlled liquidity in FRAX.\n\nAdditionally, FRAX should invest in Phantom DAO’s native PHM token either through a Phantom AMO or a treasury swap with AMO profits from the protocol (at community discretion).\n\nLastly, FRAX should provide lending liquidity through our SCREAM AMO or an exclusive lending system as the FRAX-PHM liquidity will be quite deep thanks to bond purchases.\n\nBackground\n\nPhantom DAO is a treasury-backed accelerator project similar to Olympus DAO but with unique treasury yield farming mechanics and the accelerator within the DAO. Phantom DAO is currently on the eponymous Fantom network. Phantom DAO also is an official partner of Olympus DAO which means FRAX-PHM-OHM can team up in the future as well.\n\nFRAX has native minting and AMO capability on Fantom and has expanded its ecosystem in lending and liquidity through SCREAM+SpiritSwap.\n\nGovernment Proposal\n\nFor: Intake PHM through AMO or treasury swap in conjunction with Phantom DAO’s FRAX-PHM bonds & provide PHM lending+leverage to PHM\n\nAgainst: Do nothing",

This a proposal to provide a compensation of 850 FXS ($12.000 with FXS at $14, at time of initial discussion) for the work done.\n\nCommunity members also suggested to include an upkeep cost of $1.000 for the maintenance of the dashboard. The maintenance would consist of keeping up to date the information of the current plots, for example recent information to count cvxFXS holders was included. In case this maintenance cost is accepted it would begin to apply on the month of February.\n\nAll future modifications and improvements of the Dune dashboard that would require a considerable amount of time and effort will have to apply for a grant prior to the work being finished. \n\nThe proposal was first discussed in the governance forum https://gov.frax.finance/t/compensate-work-done-on-the-dune-dashboard/497\n\n### Options\n\n1. Allocate 850 FXS (no monthly compensation)\n2. Allocate 850 FXS and additional $1.000 monthly beginning in February\n3. Do nothing\n\n",

Previous designated amount was $20m.\n\n## Background & Motivation:\nFRAX has aggressively set up the infrastructure and bridging required to expand to Polygon, Moonriver+Moonbeam, Fantom, BSC, Solana, Optimism, Harmony, Boba Network, and Avalanche. With initial liquidity deployment successful, Comptrollers are ready to continue lending and liquidity market operation activities to further deep borrowing markets and trading depth on each of the above networks.\n\nComptrollers will continue to pick the most promising and reputable lending market and AMM per chain to conduct algorithmic market operations on, with a limit of up to $65m per chain. For minted FRAX on such chains, the Collateral Ratio (CR) will adjust accordingly on ETH L1 and keep global count across all chains. All FRAX+FXS is entirely fungible and there is only 1 CR globally across all chains so that there is no excessive minting occurring that could affect FRAX peg performance on ETH or any other chain since arbitrage is kept open across all FRAX+FXS across every network.\n\nNote that no minting will occur above 100m FXS supply and the cap will be observed.\n\n## For: Approve cross-chain AMO minting limits\n## Against: Do nothing",

      "title": "FIP-38: Frax and Ondo Partnership",
      "content": "Link to governance discussion: \nhttps://gov.frax.finance/t/frax-and-ondo-frax-as-a-service-partnership-proposal/366\n\nThis proposal seeks to establish a Frax and Ondo partnership. This partnership would build on Ondo’s Liquidity-as-a-Service offering and enable the use of $FRAX (provided by the protocol itself) as liquidity for token issuers.\n\nWe propose that a portion of the future expansion of the FRAX stablecoin be minted into Frax-as-a-Service vaults as needed. This means that Frax will have no upfront costs to participate.\n\nAbout Frax-as-a-Service:\n\nFrax-as-a-Service (“FaaS”) is an offering from Ondo to make it possible for projects issuing tokens to increase the liquidity in their native tokens on decentralized exchanges by providing liquidity themselves. With FaaS, a project can deposit its token into an Ondo liquidity vault with a flexible duration. Ondo and Frax will match those deposits with an equivalent amount of FRAX to form a liquidity pair. In exchange for providing FRAX, the Frax DAO will receive a fixed 5% APR return on its provided liquidity. We plan to leverage Frax’s success at building a multichain ecosystem and hope to deploy on several other chains starting with Polygon.\n\nOndo provides several advantages over existing liquidity solutions. With Ondo, token issuers earn trading fees and rewards which reduce (or even negate) impermanent loss (IL) risk and the cost of capital. With small adjustments, Ondo vaults are well-suited to facilitating direct listings, establishing the first liquidity for a token. Direct listings could eventually replace or complement IDOs. We would love to work directly with Frax to build out these future offerings.\n\nFramework for Onboarding New FaaS Partners\n\nWe propose using the following framework for deciding whether to offer FaaS vaults to new token issuers:\n\n   - High Market Cap Protocols: $1B FDV - Up to $25M of FRAX\n   - Medium Market Cap Protocols: $250m FDV - Up to $10m of FRAX\n   - Smaller Market Cap Protocols: Minimum $50M Circulating Supply - Up to $5M of FRAX\n\nFXS Incentives:\n\nWe propose that Frax incentivize token issuers to use Frax-as-a-Service with FXS rewards. The new Uniswap and Sushiswap liquidity pools in FRAX the program would create do not yet have histories of income from trading fees that investors can rely on for returns forecasting. As such, incentives will help with onboarding new projects to FaaS with FRAX and will help bootstrap a sustainable model going forward, that will not rely on indefinite incentives.\n\nFei Protocol made a similar commitment of TRIBE incentives for its bootstrapping of LaaS. We recommend that Frax matches Fei’s commitment of providing what amounts today to roughly 500 FXS per week per $1M of liquidity from a participating DAO ($2M total including FRAX) added to FaaS. The amount of incentives provided would max out at 25,000 in FXS per week based on current prices (500 FXS per week per $1M in partner liquidity assuming $50M in total partner liquidity). If more than $50M in partner liquidity is provided ($100M in total liquidity), then the total FXS incentives from the program would be shared pro-rata with partners based on their contribution. For example, if participating projects and their communities provided $100M of liquidity, then incentives would be diluted down to 250 per week per $1M of liquidity. We strongly believe that this initial expense will be well worth it to attract new partners and foster the growth of the FRAX stablecoin.\n\nBenefits to Frax:\n\n   1) A 5% Fixed APR on all FRAX used as FaaS liquidity\n   2) Build out new and strengthen existing relationships with other   communities\n   3) Increase the supply of FRAX and expand its reach\n   4) Establish new liquidity pools based in FRAX with a focus on multichain initiatives\n\nRisks to Frax:\n\n    1) The fixed tranche side of our vaults (which FRAX would be deposited into) can realize losses if the variable tranche side of the pair experiences about an 80% decline in price.\n\n    2) Smart contract risk with Ondo. We have three audits available for review here. One of our audits is from Quantstamp.\n\nPlease Vote Below For One of Following Two Options:\n\n1)  Establish a partnership with Ondo and allow the Frax core team to pick FaaS partners\n\n2) Do Nothing\n",

      "content": "## Authors\nJason Huan, Dennis, Sam Kazemian\n\n## Summary:\nThe previous [November 11th Convex Votium bribe snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/frax.eth/proposal/0x170e5aec43640529a83aa7df05515e47094c0a9b512f5c6c3f38ef47e4e85603) continuously allocated up to $2.5m worth of FXS for the bi-weekly Convex Gauge-Weight Vote to bribe for the FRAX3CRV gauge on votium. As the gauges have become more competitive recently, with an expected increase in bribe amounts from other protocols, we are proposing to increase the bribe up to $5m worth of FXS at comptroller discretion. Note that this is simply the maximum amount, and not necessarily the exact amount that will be bribed on Votium.\n\n## Background & Motivation:\nThe Curve pool gauge-weight vote is voted on by veCRV holders, of which Convex holds roughly half the circulating supply. Convex allows holders of vlCVX (vote-locked CVX) to vote on how the platform's veCRV should be allocated.\n\nVotium allows for anyone to create a bribe for vlCVX holders for a specific gauge, claimable upon voting in Convex's bi-weekly snapshot allocation.\n\nFrax currently has 28.8% of Convex's entire veCRV amount in the Curve gauge-weight vote, up from 15.1% two periods ago. Convex's veCRV gauge allocation is re-weighted every other week, with the current vote ending on November 15th. To defend our allocation, we propose increasing the bribes to up to $5m worth of FXS at comptroller discretion. Rewards from increased gauge APR will be distributed across all FXS holders due to FXS1559 buying back FXS with protocol profit.\n\nAs this has been on onging allocation, the change would carry forward to future Convex gauge weight voting periods.\n\nFor: Approve allocation\nAgainst: Do nothing",

      "content": "Forum Post: \nhttps://gov.frax.finance/t/vesper-finance-vafrax-gauge/291\n\nProposal:\nAdd the Vesper Finance vaFRAX pool token to FRAX Gauges\n\nAbstract:\nvaFRAX is the tokenized pool share of Vesper's recently launched FRAX pool, which deploys FRAX deposits across miscellaneous strategies to compound yield on platforms like Aave, Rari Fuse, Curve, and Convex.\n\nThere are several key benefits to the FRAX ecosystem through this proposal:\n\n1.) An easy-to-use, gas-conscious, secure mechanism for earning high yield on FRAX (note that Vesper will additionally award participants with VSP)\n2.) Higher liquidity on protocols that are not as easily incentivized with gauges, such as Rari Fuse pools and Aave.\n3.) A set of products for FRAX Protocol itself to earn yield on its own underlying treasury assets through vaFRAX and for assets supported by other Vesper pools.\n\nVoting Options:\nFor: Add vaFRAX pool token to veFXS gauges\nAgainst: Do nothing",

      "content": "## Original Author\n0xTax\n\n## Subject\nFrax & ZigZag partnership: Frax provides liquidity for the FRAX-USDC & FRAX-ETH pairs on ZigZag’s L2 DEX.\n\n## Summary\nAllow Frax to provide liquidity to the Decentralized Exchange ‘‘ZigZag’’ on the L2s zkSync & StarkNet by minting FRAX and supplying ETH + USDC for collateral.\n\n## Introduction\nZigZag is a decentralized orderbook exchange powered by ZK Rollups. Currently, we are the only live DEX on zkSync 1.0. Besides that, we are launching on StarkNet next month as the first and only DEX and will launch on zkSync 2.0. We are aiming for deep liquidity with thick order books which we think could be mutually beneficial with Frax.\n\n## Governance Proposal\nWe propose for Frax to mint 5M FRAX and bridge over the minted FRAX to L2s zkSync 1.0 and StarkNet. Furthermore, we propose for Frax to provide $2.5M equivalent in ETH and $2.5M equivalent USDC collateral as liquidity to ZigZag. This way Frax provides liquidity for a total of $10M to zkSync 1.0 and ZigZag’s StarkNet launch. After StarkNet launch, more FRAX will be minted and more ETH and USDC collateral will be provided as liquidity ($10M) for a **total amount of $20M.**\n\nAs more attention is being given to ZK-Proofs, it becomes clear that this is the final method of scaling Ethereum and a lot of TVL from alternative L2s will flow into zkSync and StarkNet’s networks. For Frax to get a well-established position into this new ecosystem, our exchange introducing FRAX as a stablecoin pair would bring more use case/liquidity and utility to the whole Frax Protocol. This is a great opportunity for both platforms to take advantage of a newly established endgame ecosystem.\n\n\n## This benefits Frax as a whole by:\n* Exposure: FRAX trading pairs on zkSync and StarkNet beating other stable coins to the L2s\nRevenue: through the spread from market making; current revenue is ~$2k a day and revenue will go up linearly as volume increases\n* Future potential: As ZigZag grows, we will introduce margin trading in which Frax will also be earning yield off.\n\n## Links:\n[Original forum thread](https://gov.frax.finance/t/fip-36-frax-x-zigzag-partnership/272)\n[ZigZag Exchange](https://info.zigzag.exchange/)\n[ZigZag’s Linktree](https://linktr.ee/ZigZagExchange)\n\n## For: Provide $20m Liquidity\n## Against: Do nothing",

We as the Comptrollers propose a $3m FXS <> OHM token swap to further align incentives between the two protocols as we progress through the era of DeFi 2.0 together.\n\nWith the recent launch of Olympus Pro, Frax is also accumulating protocol-controlled liquidity through FRAX-ETH SUSHI LP [Olympus Pro bonds](https://pro.olympusdao.finance/#/bond/frax_eth_sushi), emitting FXS from the liquidity mining allocation to do so. As the two protocols continue to innovate, we believe that further collaboration will continue to benefit all token holders of both OHM and FXS.\n\nThe proposed token swap would be marked at a 30-day trailing time-weighted average price from the end of the snapshot vote, and would occur shortly thereafter.\n\nFor: Approve token swap\nAgainst: Do nothing",

Convex has been potentially exploring in building aggregator farms for Frax gauges. To do this, they must be whitelisted to stake veFXS just like they are whitelisted on Curve.\n\nFRAX also is the largest protocol holder of CVX. We have been early partners since Convex’s launch. We strongly support the Convex team and have been working with them for months.\n\nThis should be a fairly simple vote.\n\nFor: Whitelist Convex\nAgainst: Do nothing",

It is the biggest Euro stablecoin in the market. The Angle Protocol is soon going to launch FRAX as a collateral making it another integration for the FRAX ecosystem.\n\nAs mentionned in the forum thread, there would be multiple benefits for this gauge:\n1.) Create Euro exposure for FRAX holders through the FRAX/agEUR pool\n2.) Angle is going to further incentivize the gauge with ANGLE rewards doubling the token rewards for users\n3.) Build a partnership with a decentralized stablecoin protocol (that does not plan to go to USD) that builds in itself many interesting use cases for FRAX holders like strategies for FRAX on Aave\n\nVoting Options:\nYes: Add UniV3 agEUR/FRAX pair to veFXS gauges\nNo: Do nothing",

      "content": "Authors\nFrax Comptrollers\n\n## Summary:\nVesq.io 33 is an Olympus inspired project that seeks to be the reserve currency of the Polygon ecosystem. Their prelaunch event has allocated FRAX protocol an allotment of pVESQ tokens to purchase. This proposal is to use $300,000 of AMO profits that accrue to the balance sheet to swap for pVESQ that has been allotted for our protocol.\n\n## Background & Motivation:\nThe Vesq Protocol is a reserve currency system being built for the Polygon ecosystem. Vesq is going to use FRAX as one of its predominant stablecoins in its treasury and issue VESQ-FRAX bonds at launch. FRAX is also going to build out its Polygon ecosystem with Vesq in lending markets, liquidity, and hopefully other collaborations to come. FRAX developers have talked to the Vesq core team multiple times.\n\nFRAX protocol earns ~$400,000/day from AMOs. Thus, we can swap FRAX stablecoins earned as profit to participate in the Vesq.io 33 launch and show our support. This would also be a great DAO <> DAO opportunity as it aligns both protocols to grow together on Polygon.\n\n## For: Purchase pVESQ for the protocol to balance sheet\n## Against: Do nothing",

      "title": "Bribe $150k worth of FXS to Votemak for TempleDAO in the Tokemak Core Reactor 2 Vote",
      "content": "Authors\nJason Huan, Sam Kazemian\n\nSummary:\nThe 2nd Tokemak C.o.R.E. vote is active with 48 hours left to vote for the next five Tokemak reactors. We propose to bribe $150k worth of FXS from the community allocation at comptroller discretion to help fund a TEMPLE reactor for TempleDAO on Tokemak.\n\nBackground & Motivation:\nTokemak's C.o.R.E. competition allows TOKE holders to vote on which reactors are added next to the platform. A Tokemak reactor takes in the specified token ($TEMPLE in this case) and matches it again $TOKE. Both sides are open to deposits by the public, so anyone is able to get yield from the reactor by depositing either token. The reactors are controlled by \"Liquidity Directors\", which are responsible for deploying the asset and earning yield, which goes back to the depositors.\n\nWe propose supporting TempleDAO's choice to intake $FRAX by helping them out in the current reactor vote, as well as establishing a step towards future collaboration.\n\nNote that since the C.o.R.E. vote ends in 48 hours, this is a shortened snapshot vote of 24 hours to allow for the circumstances.\n\nFor: Approve allocation\nAgainst: Do nothing",

      "content": "## Authors\nJason Huan, Dennis, Sam Kazemian\n\n## Summary:\nThe [October 28th Convex votium bribe snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/frax.eth/proposal/0x0c1f7d194dfa64adf5c63aeedca3d8fbfc537d67be586d9652c9ec2745e98be2) continuously allocated up to $1m worth of FXS for the bi-weekly Convex Gauge-Weight Vote to bribe for the FRAX3CRV gauge on votium. As the gauges have become more competitive recently, we are proposing to increase the bribe up to $2.5m total FXS at comptroller discretion.\n\n## Background & Motivation:\nThe Curve pool gauge-weight vote is voted on by veCRV holders, of which Convex holds roughly half the circulating supply. Convex allows holders of vlCVX (vote-locked CVX) to vote on how the platform's veCRV should be allocated.\n\nVotium allows for anyone to create a bribe for vlCVX holders for a specific gauge, claimable upon voting in Convex's bi-weekly snapshot allocation.\n\nFrax currently has 15.1% of Convex's entire veCRV amount in the Curve gauge-weight vote, down from 19.5% last period. Convex's veCRV gauge allocation is re-weighted every other week, with the current vote ending on November 15th. To defend our allocation, we propose increasing the bribes to up to $2.5m total worth of FXS at comptroller discretion. Rewards from increased gauge APR will be distributed across all FXS holders due to FXS1559 buying back FXS with protocol profit.\n\nAs this has been on onging allocation, the change would carry forward to future Convex gauge weight voting periods.\n\nFor: Approve allocation\nAgainst: Do nothing",

      "title": "Create a gauge for ETH/Frax put selling strategy?",
      "content": "**Summary**\n\nAdd a brand new Stake DAO ETH/FRAX put selling option strategy Gauge\n\n**Background & Motivation**\n\nOur Stake DAO partnership has been mutually beneficial since the beginning and allowed both parties to increase TVL and Frax’s market cap. Stake DAO has voted for the Frax gauge with 100% of their vote on Curve since the beginning of the partnership in June, while we allocated nearly $80m of our AMOs to Stake DAO.\n\nThey have recently released an ETH/FRAX Put Selling Strategy which generates outsized yields by selling ETH put options, collateralized by LP tokens of Stake DAO’s Passive FRAX strategy (sdFRAX3CRV not staked in the current gauge), and reinvest the yield it earns back into the strategy, allowing for a compounding effect over time. Therefore, this strategy provides liquidity on Curve’s Frax pool, which is valuable to FRAX as it contributes in stabilizing the peg. You can read more about the ETH/FRAX Put Selling Strategy in this medium article 4.\n\nEven before any incentives this strategy is expected to generate 80% APY (first week achieved APY: 108%). Similar strategy on Ribbon.finance based on yvUSDC has more than $50m of liquidity for a much lower APY. If this strategy was incentivized with FXS and SDT, we believe it would bring significant liquidity to Frax to the Curve pool. With no gauge, this strategy will be less profitable than the Passive Frax strategy which makes no sense in terms of risk / return.\n\nIntroducing a gauge for Stake DAO’s ETH/FRAX Put Selling Strategy would be profitable for the DAO as :\n*It will create an unexplored use case for FRAX users by providing them access to the derivative market while solving the gas costs issues of trading options\n*It incentivizes more FRAX liquidity on Curve since the strategy accepts FRAX3CRV LP as a deposit for the strategy\n*It will increase the attractivity of Frax since it is a strategy that does not exist for any other stable coin\n*It offers users a new risk profile: no impermanent loss risk but volatility risk on Ethereum. If the strategy is successful, a similar strategy with BTC will probably be envisaged\n*Stake DAO can further incentivize this gauge with SDT rewards, to add an additional layer of rewards for users\n*It will allow us to further tie our relationship with Stake DAO\n\n**For:** create a gauge for the ETH/Frax put strategy\n\n**Against:** do nothing",

We propose to formally allocate 1m FXS tokens from the original farming allocation to provide liquidity across these chains and bootstrap DEX efforts.\n\nThe Frax protocol currently has 99.8m total FXS supply at a circulating FRAX supply of 550m. To expand the liquidity to other chains and increase our presence, we propose the 1m cross-chain allocation for FXS. Benefits of increased cross-chain liquidity will help boost FRAX demand as it is adopted across other ecosystems and protocols.\n\nFor: Approve allocation\nAgainst: Do nothing",

As the gauges have become more competitive recently, we are proposing to increase the bribe up to $1m total worth of FXS at comptroller discretion.\n\n## Background & Motivation:\nThe Curve pool gauge-weight vote is voted on by veCRV holders, of which Convex holds roughly half the circulating supply. Convex allows holders of vlCVX (vote-locked CVX) to vote on how the platform's veCRV should be allocated.\n\nVotium allows for anyone to create a bribe for vlCVX holders for a specific gauge, claimable upon voting in Convex's bi-weekly snapshot allocation.\n\nFrax currently has 19.5% of Convex's entire veCRV amount in the Curve gauge-weight vote, up from 18.2% last period. Convex's veCRV gauge allocation is re-weighted every other week, with the current vote ending on November 2nd. To keep increasing our allocation, we propose increasing the bribes to up to $1m total worth of FXS at comptroller discretion. Rewards from increased gauge APR will be distributed across all FXS holders due to FXS1559 buying back FXS with protocol profit.\n\nAs this has been on onging allocation, the change would carry forward to future Convex gauge weight voting periods.\n\nFor: Approve allocation\nAgainst: Do nothing",

Meaning that the protocol is more easily upgradable in the future (pluggable). Casper Network can be compared to the future ETH 3.0 upgrade, and should not go unnoticed by the developers of the Ethereum community. \n\nI believe there is a strong likelihood for the Casper Network to be a top tier coin, as it is made to facilitate all levels of enterprise and public adaption, while also remaining true to the values of decentralization and security. Due to the youth of the Casper Network, the network has yet to get a stable coin developed on the platform. FRAX would stand to gain a large first/early mover advantage on Casper Network, would we implement/bridge the protocol over. \n\nThis proposal is made to make the team do necessary research about and around the network, and give a short report (1-3 pages) on if/if not they see value in such a implementation/bridge. \n\nIn the report,  there should be information about:\nDEVxDAO* funding possibilities for FRAX bridge/implementation\nThe potential of the Casper Network technology (if my statements are true)\nCasper Network as an FRAX expansion opportunity\nNotes on Casper Network Community \nValues comparison between FRAX and Casper Network\n\n*DEVxDAO is a DAO created for supporting developers/DAOs create opensource and decentralized products. There is a possibility the FRAX Community can get funded for creating a stable coin and ecosystem on the Casper Network. \n\nExtra notes:\nA solidity compiler is being built and is soon deployed for use on the Casper Network. \nThe main building language of the Casper Network is Rust. \n\nEasy-to-read resources: \nhttps://ghoststaking.com/category/commentary/\nhttps://www.banklesstimes.com/2021/08/23/casper-labs-is-bringing-blockchain-to-the-enterprise/\n\nOther resources: \nhttps://casper.network/en/network\nhttps://caspernetwork.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ (Documentation) \nhttps://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.02159.pdf (Whitepaper) \nhttps://www.devxdao.com/\nhttps://portal.devxdao.com/public-proposals\n",

      "content": "Sam did some economic modelling and strongly believes that for the current growth phase of FRAX, we should change the FXS1559 50-50 burns to 100% veFXS yield rather than burning 50% with AMO profits.\n\nThis is for a few reasons:\n\n1.) Higher veFXS yield will lead to more FXS demand and new fraximalists entering the ecosystem to stake and lock veFXS which aligns long term incentives together. Doing this should at minimum double the current veFXS yield to 25-30% APR, significantly higher than veCRV yield which is about 8%.\n\n2.) Burning FXS this early in the protocol’s growth phase gives exit liquidity to farmers/short term sellers when we could be re-investing the profits into creating long term veFXS stakers. Using the profits for veFXS is not the same as burning FXS because burning gives sellers a chance to exit, while increasing veFXS yield incentivizes users to become fraximalists for multiple years. In fact, Tetranode is famous for advocating for less burning of tokens (in any protocol) and more staking yield as it creates a positive sum scenario for long term holders (and not short term dumpers).\n\n3.) Doing this should also lead to short/medium term FXS price appreciation which would make our expansion/growth faster. Although conducting monetary policy based on FXS price should be held to a minimum since governance token speculation is not something we should focus on, it is still likely a positive effect of this move.\n\n4.) We can always re-adjust this ratio back to 50-50 (or a new ratio) per another governance discussion+vote so this is not meant to be something that cannot be reassessed.\n\nForum discussion can be found here: https://gov.frax.finance/t/move-100-of-fxs1559-to-vefxs-yield/174\n\nDo you agree with this proposal?",

This will provide Tokemak with a reserve of FXS tokens to mitigate against impermanent loss for reactor stakers when liquidity deployment goes live and will provide Frax with a supply of Toke that can be used by Frax to direct liquidity and incentivize the FXS reactor with Tokemak rewards. Further information about the reactor launching process: https://medium.com/tokemak/the-path-to-liquidity-deployment-4cf9885eb619\nIntroduction to Tokemak more broadly: https://medium.com/tokemak/introducing-tokemak-the-utility-for-sustainable-liquidity-8b99a4757301\n\nProposed Action:\nThis proposal authorizes up to 1M FXS from the FXS treasury to exchange for an equivalent amount TOKE determined by a 7 day average market price of each token. \n\nProjected Impact:\nFXS will be able to launch its own Tokemak reactor. In addition by holding a significant supply of Toke Frax will be able to both direct the FXS liquidity in the reactor and incentivize the reactor with Toke rewards. Frax will have a large seat at the Tokemak governance table from day 1. It should be noted Frax is not required to subsidize the reactor or provide rewards to stakers; stakers in FXS's reactor will receive Toke rewards provided by the Toke team.",

      "content": "## Authors\nJason Huan, Dennis, Sam Kazemian\n\n## Summary:\nAllocate $200k worth of FXS for the [October 14th Convex Gauge-Weight Vote](https://vote.convexfinance.com/#/proposal/QmaS9vd1vJKQNBYX4KWQ3nppsTT3QSL3nkz5ZYSwEJk6hZ) to bribe for the FRAX3CRV gauge on votium. If the gauge becomes competitive, the bribe can be increased up to $500k total at comptroller discretion.\n\n## Background & Motivation:\nThe Curve pool gauge-weight vote is voted on by veCRV holders, of which Convex holds roughly half the circulating supply. Convex allows holders of vlCVX (vote-locked CVX) to vote on how the platform's veCRV should be allocated.\n\nVotium allows for anyone to create a bribe for vlCVX holders for a specific gauge, claimable upon voting in Convex's bi-weekly snapshot allocation.\n\nFrax currently has 18.2% of Convex's entire veCRV amount in the Curve gauge-weight vote, up from 9% a month ago. Convex's veCRV gauge allocation is re-weighted every other week, with the current vote ending on October 18th. To keep increasing our allocation, we propose a $200k bribe of FXS taken from the original farming allocation, with an option of an additional $300k for up to $500k total at comptroller discretion. Rewards from increased gauge APR will be distributed across all FXS holders due to FXS1559 buying back FXS with protocol profit.\n\nSince the Convex re-weight occurs biweekly, this is an ongoing allocation. Frax currently has an 11.5% share of all of the CRV inflation through the gauges.\n\nFor: Approve allocation\nAgainst: Do nothing",

With final testing approaching completion, Comptrollers are ready to activate certain lending and liquidity market operation activities to kickstart deep borrow markets and trading depth on each of the above networks.\n\nThis proposal is to activate 1 Lending AMO and 1 Liquidity AMO per chain. Comptrollers will pick the most promising and reputable lending market and AMM per chain to conduct initial algorithmic market operations on. For example, on AVAX, we are planning to mint FRAX into Benqi’s lending market and mint FRAX-FXS and/or FRAX-USDC liquidity into Pangolin DEX.\n\nWe plan to conduct the analog of these market operations on each chain with a limit of up to $20m per chain (with another governance vote needed to increase this ceiling). For minted FRAX on such chains, the CR will adjust accordingly on ETH L1 and keep global count across all chains. All FRAX+FXS is entirely fungible and there is only 1 CR globally across all chains so that there is no excessive minting occurring that could affect FRAX peg performance on ETH or any other chain since arbitrage is kept open across all FRAX+FXS across every network.\n\n### For: Approve activation of AMOs on all chains+minting of FRAX & FXS limit per chain.\n### Against: Do nothing",

      "content": "#### Original Forum Discussion: https://gov.frax.finance/t/fip-22-olympus-bond-program-with-fxs/130\n\n## Author\nSam Kazemian, Frax core devs, & input/feedback from Ohmies in the community (jawz, Wartull, Zeus, and other big Ohmies)\n\n## Summary\nLiquidity for FRAX is key for the Frax Ecosystem. However, this liquidity can come at a steep price due to the emissions needed to sustain that liquidity. Recently we have been accruing ETH on the balance sheet for FXS-ETH LP per governance vote. This governance vote is to further our collaboration with the Olympus community to become founding users of their Olympus Bond System for balance sheet accrual of FRAX-ETH SLP bonds.\n\n## The Solution\nWe are proposing an FXS bond program in partnership with Olympus. We will offer 90K FXS each month available for purchase via bonds. These bonds will be targeting a FRAX/ETH pair on Sushiswap. This LP will be locked into the balance sheet of the protocol counted as assets similar to our other assets like CVX, ETH, etc. This can will help us build a permanent liquidity for FRAX (first as SLP on Sushiswap but redeployable with governance to other places/L2s etc if necessary).\n\nWith the accumulated LP tokens from the sales of FXS bonds, Frax will also have the ability to farm additional tokens with a potential Onsen allocation as well as earn fees on top of the acquired LP. For example, Olympus earned around 2.5m in fees in their first 4 months.\n\nImplementation: In essence, Olympus is offering it’s bonding program to Frax through its Bond product pilot for protocols that have a direct relationship with the DAO. This would include having the UI built for this program, helping us set everything up, and continuing to maintain the parameters for the program. In exchange for their support and expertise, Olympus would take a 3.3% fee on all FXS bonds sold. Olympus will use the FXS they earned from their fees as extra backing for OHM, which would help to reduce the circulating supply even further since it will be locked in their treasury. They have also expressed interest in locking this FXS as veFXS directly if they are whitelisted so the FXS fees could go directly to furthering Olympus DAO’s extra alignment with Frax.\n\nOlympus bonds offer the FXS at a discount to the user for providing SLP tokens. This discount will be closely monitored and can be considered as a success factor where this would preferably be less than 10% on average (Olympus bonds have an average of 6-7% discount).\n\nThese FXS bonds will have a two week linear vesting period (14 days). This is to ensure that discount buyers can’t immediately flip their positions because they typically will be buying at a discount. The FXS bonds will continually vest, so you will be able to make partial claims before the vesting period is over if you want to sell, farm, or LP with the FXS.\n\n## Conclusion\nWe propose to be founding partners in this program to further our collaboration with Olympus and accrue balance sheet assets for Frax in the form of further FRAX-ETH liquidity. This also opens up the opportunity to bootstrap other pools if/when needed through this program and further align the communities of both Frax and Olympus.",

      "content": "Forum Thread:\nhttps://gov.frax.finance/t/fip-21-g-uni-gauge-for-frax-stablecoin-pairs/127\n\nProposal:\nAdd the following G-UNI stablecoin pairs to Frax gauges including:\n\nFRAX-DAI\nFRAX-sUSD\nFRAX-LUSD\nFRAX-UST\nFRAX-USDN\nFRAX-USDP\nFRAX-alUSD\nFRAX-MIM\nFRAX-TUSD\nFRAX-FEI\n\nAbstract:\nG-UNI is a fungible (ERC20) wrapper around an LP Position on a Uniswap V3 trading pair. Fees earned by the position are automatically reinvested into the position by Gelato automation for compounding effects. Liquidity is added into the G-UNI Pooled Position and G-UNI tokens are minted. These G-UNI tokens have the ability to be staked into liquidity mining program such as Frax's veFXS rewards to earn FXS \n\nTechnical Details:\nThe G-UNI stablecoin pools will be a fixed range position that does not change. At first, the pool will be managed by the Gelato multisig but will be handed off to the Frax team shortly after.\n\nExample G-UNI FRAX/DAI specs\nFee Tier: 0.05% \nPosition Lower Bound: 1 FRAX = 0.9901 DAI (tick = -100)\nPosition Upper Bound: 1 FRAX = 1.0101 DAI (tick = 100)\n\nVoting Options:\nYes, add G-UNI Frax stablecoin pairs to veFXS gauges\nNo, do nothing",

Convex allows holders of vlCVX (vote-locked CVX) to [vote](https://snapshot.org/#/cvx.eth/proposal/QmUjELF3ABSV2f5xgQrJgEnZTPb86DAtT6gzoa8RfHUuAK) on how the platform's veCRV should be allocated. \n\nVotium allows for anyone to create a bribe for vlCVX holders for a specific gauge, claimable upon voting in Convex's weekly snapshot allocation.\n\nFrax currently has 9% of Convex's entire veCRV amount in the curve gauge vote, which will now be open to allocation by vlCVX holders instead of pre-determined amonts. As a result, Convex's veCRV gauge allocation is due to change this upcoming week, starting Sept. 22nd. To defend this allocation, we propose a $200k bribe of FXS taken from the original farming allocation. Since Frax is currently roughly 60% of the entire veCRV pool, rewards from increased gauge APR will be distributed across all FXS holders due to FXS1559 buying back FXS with protocol profit.\n\nNote that other protocols with convex veCRV allocations are also considering bribes for vlCVX holders to vote for their gauges. Frax [currently has](https://dao.curve.fi/gaugeweight) a 5.13% share of all of the CRV inflation through the gauges.\n\n## For: Allocate $200k worth of FXS on Votium\n\n## Against: Do nothing\n",

      "content": "Link to Original Forum Thread: https://gov.frax.finance/t/fip-18-update-fraxpool-to-match-amo-specifications/111\n\n## Summary:\nRe-deploy the USDC Frax Pool to only allow minting of FRAX when the price is above the peg window, and redeeming when the price is below the peg window. \n\nTo start, the peg window will be between [$0.9933, $1.0033], where FRAX will be redeemable or mintable past those prices, respectively.\n\n## Background & Motivation:\nThe current version of the Frax Pool released at genesis allows for minting and redeeming of FRAX at the collateral ratio. As the system has grown over the past 8 months while holding the peg perfectly, the demand and depth of liquidity for FXS has increased respectively. Since mints and redeems offer the swap of FRAX to FXS + USDC at no slippage, arbitrageurs may profit off of FXS volatility by arbitraging against the Frax Pool.\n\nTo fix this, we are proposing to update the Frax Pool implementation to match the AMO specs listed in the [documentation](https://docs.frax.finance/amo/overview) so that minting and redeeming are able to be called by the public only when the FRAX TWAP deviates outside of the peg. FRAX will still be able to be traded at the peg in the [curve pool](https://curve.fi/frax), which will act as the first and primary source of liquidity for the protocol. This proposal protects the FXS price long-term.\n\nAdditionally, we are implementing the passed [FIP-15](https://snapshot.org/#/frax.eth/proposal/QmWVe7X1JNMxS5ykSst8QZerA3NZdshJMzwKPSaWBRUnPf) update to buyback with this new Frax Pool improvement.\n\nLastly, the recollateralize function will also target the new CR by minting FXS and selling it for FRAX thus increasing the CR. This is the exact symetrical specs to FIP-15 for the buyback function.\n\n## For: Update FraxPool Implementation\n## Against: Do nothing",

It essentially incentivizes more FRAX Curve liquidity since Stake DAO takes FRAX3CRV LP as deposits similar to Curve/Convex.\n2.) Stake DAO is a whitelisted protocol that can stake veFXS so it will be in Stake DAO’s interest to build up the gauge weight for this in the future.\n3.) Expand on our already successful partnership before which has gotten FRAX a lot of veCRV votes and Stake DAO $50m+ of TVL.\n4.)

A lot of these jars are wrapped+incentivized yearn vaults themselves like crvFRAX. Pickle has expressed interest in staking veFXS to offer its users higher yield on gauge farming pairs. This would expand Pickle’s offering as well as allow them to further incentivize selected gauge pairs with PICKLE. Overall, this seems like a win-win for both protocols if they work together. Essentially, Pickle would like to become the Yearn of FRAX the same way Yearn has an outsize position in veCRV.

      "content": "### Original Governance Discussion: \nhttps://gov.frax.finance/t/fip-unlock-eth-frax-pool-and-integrate-it-into-the-gauge-system/98\n\n## Authors:\nJustin Bram, Brazy \n\n## Summary:\nThis proposal seeks to unlock the FRAX<>ETH liquidity providers, create a UniV3 gauge for FRAX<>ETH, and transfer a portion of the emissions to the overall gauge system to increase the gauge emissions to 25,000 FXS/day.  This would NOT affect the overall daily FXS emissions, it would only affect the emissions controlled by the gauge system. \n\n## Proposal: \nAt the moment, the overall gauge system has emissions of approximately 16,400 FXS/day, which came from the original UniV2 Frax<>USDC pool. The Frax<>ETH pool is also receiving rewards of approximately 16,400 FXS/day. We propose to end the FRAX<>ETH emission, and transfer about 52% of these emissions into the overall gauge system. As a result, the gauge system would be responsible for approximately 25,000 FXS/day of emissions. The remaining 48% (approx. 7,890 FXS/day) would go to the Frax Protocol Treasury. This will help the protocol build a big war chest, and it would be beneficial for the long-term health of the protocol. Every FXS we save now is one that we can use later to pay for locked liquidity or investments in the protocol. This also buys us more time to develop the protocol and revenue sources so that we can sustainably pay for locked liquidity when the initial liquidity incentives run out.\nFurthermore, we propose to approve a UniV3 gauge for FRAX<>ETH. This would allow veFXS stakers to vote on how high the emissions for this pool should be. This gauge should be launched whenever the team is ready to implement it. \nThe current FRAX<>ETH pool is quite costly from a protocol perspective and provides little benefit aside from locking up FRAX. According to Uniswap analytics, this pool typically only sees between $1-2M of volume each day. We could support the demand with a much smaller pool.\nBecause of the large FRAX<>Stablecoin pools, this liquidity isn’t especially useful. If this proposal were implemented and the new pool was only minimally incentivized, users could use the FRAX → USDC/DAI → ETH Uniswap route for large transactions.\n\nBenefits:\nIncreases the number of rewards available to the gauge system\nReduces the amount of FXS that enters the open market daily\nAllows the community to decide how the Frax<>ETH pool should be incentivized\nAllows the community to support emissions for new integrations and pairs (example: Sushi gauge)\n\nDrawbacks:\nA large amount of locked up Frax will be unlocked \n\n### For: Unlock Frax/ETH pool and Shift Rewards to Gauge System, targeting 25,000 FXS/day. \n\n### Against: Do nothing \n",

      "content": "### Link to Original Forum Thread - https://gov.frax.finance/t/fip-15-update-protocol-buyback-function/82\n\n## Summary:\n### Change the Frax protocol buyback function to preserve collateral within the protocol.\n\n## Background & Motivation:\n\n*Note - This proposal is entirely focused on the protocol buyback function, which is not to be confused with buybacks from protocol generated revenue. This proposal would not alter buybacks from protocol generated revenue or FXS-1559.*  \n\nThe Frax protocol buyback function is a mechanism to match the protocol’s target collateralization ratio (CR) with the actual CR. When the amount of collateral in the system exceeds the target amount (actual CR > target CR), the buyback function becomes available. Currently, the buyback function uses existing collateral (USDC at this time) to create a limit order to buy FXS that equals the amount of excess collateral in the protocol. The protocol is essentially removing excess collateral by purchasing FXS.\n\nWhile this approach has been successful to date, the downside is that it balances the CR by removing collateral from the system. There is an alternate approach, which now appears to be the better path forward: instead of removing collateral from the protocol, the protocol can mint additional FRAX such that the new total balance of FRAX divided by the existing collateral equals the target CR rate. This additional amount of FRAX minted to balance the CR would then be used to purchase FXS on the open market, likely in a similar manner to FXS-1559 (though 100% would be used to buy and burn FXS).\n\nThere are three obvious benefits to the change. Long term it encourages the growth of Frax’s balance sheet by adding liabilities (additional FRAX) rather than shrinking the balance sheet by removing assets (removing collateral). The additional FRAX ultimately boosts the total FRAX supply.\n\nIt is now obvious that protocol collateral is incredibly valuable to Frax. Frax is currently on pace to earn 8 figures of protocol revenue in 2021 primarily driven by the effective use of idle protocol collateral. Reducing collateral leads to a reduction in revenue. This change will preserve protocol collateral within the protocol and increase protocol revenue compared with the current buyback function.\n\nThe final benefit is that it shifts the protocol from a passive to an active buyer for buybacks. So rather than have a sitting limit order for FXS at the oracle price, the protocol will actively conduct buybacks on the open market in the same manner that FXS-1559 currently operates. While the size of the buyback in FXS terms may be less due to slippage, the ability to execute it on demand may offset any slippage (2% slippage doesn’t matter if the order sits for a day and the price of FXS increases by 5% in that time). It is important that 100% of the FRAX generated for the buyback be used for the buyback and not allocated via the FXS-1559 fee split.\n\n## For: Update the buyback function to preserve collateral within the protocol\n\n## Against: Do nothing",

      "content": "## Summary\nAdd a FRAX-SUSHI Sushiswap gauge to veFXS gauges.\n\n## Background & Motivation:\nIn an effort to diversify gauge weights and signal that veFXS gauges are not simply for 1 particular type of AMM, it is proposed to add a Sushiswap FRAX-SUSHI pair to the veFXS gauges. Sushiswap has supported FRAX since its early days by adding it to their Onsen menu back in February. Additionally, they have added FRAX pairs on Polygon and their other chain deployments.\n\nSUSHI has a predominant amount of liquidity against ETH and almost none against any stablecoin. The system uses ETH to route in and out of stablecoins. While this is fine for them, it would be prudent to become their stablecoin of choice by providing a high amount of liquidity directly for SUSHI. Additionally, some Sushi chefs have expressed interest in supporting FRAX further if they get a gauge. This will also advance FRAX's multichain strategy with Sushiswap and opens the door for future cross-chain collaboration.\n\nLastly, having gauges on multiple AMMs shows credible neutrality that veFXS gauges are not only for Uni v3 pairs. This is important as FRAX seeks to win over other protocols to buy into the gauge system by being AMM-agnostic.\n\nThis proposal does not affect future proposals adding other gauges as planned such as other stable-stable Uni v3 pairs. Anyone in the community and other projects can proposal veFXS gauges on any AMM with FRAX and/or FXS being part of the pair.\n\n### For: Add FRAX-SUSHI veFXS Gauge\n### Against: Do nothing",

By adding gauges, veFXS holders are able to vote on where the FXS inflation will go, directly proportional to the veFXS vote amount. Additionally, the gauge system will allow for new incentivized asset pairs against FRAX to be added in through governance. The current FRAX-WETH and FRAX-FXS farming rewards on Uni v2 will not be affected by this proposal.\n\nThe gauge activation will start with the Uni v2 FRAX-USDC emissions and move them to the first gauge, Uni v3 FRAX-USDC. All locked stakes in the new gauge system and subsequent farming systems will remain locked and not be unlocked. This proposal only affects the Uni v2 FRAX-USDC pair and any new farming partnerships.\n\n**If adopted**, this proposal seeks to:\n1. Activate the veFXS gauges with FRAX/USDC, FRAX/DAI, and FRAX/mUSD as initial pairs\n2. Set precedent for the addition of future gauges\n\nThis **benefits Frax** as a whole by:\n* Allowing FXS farming emissions to be redirected in accordance to veFXS holders\n* Allowing tighter coordination with other stablecoin projects\n\n### For: Activate veFXS Gauges\n### Against: Do nothing",

Within the peg bounds, delegated/whitelisted accounts can conduct monetary policy expeditiously so long as the FRAX price peg is within bounds. Additionally, we’d propose adding timelocks to certain functions such as adding/removing AMOs even if the price is within the peg bounds.\n\nWe propose that within the peg’s bounds, delegated addresses should be afforded privileges to conduct monetary policy such as rebalancing AMOs, updating the CR by 1 tick (currently set to .25%) per t period (t =1 hour), and other monetary policy. These delegates are called “Comptrollers of the Currency” and currently only the core team. They can be added/removed by timelocked FIP-style governance vote. Currently, only the team has any privileges, but others can be added in the future that join the core team or are prominent community members.\n\n\nIf adopted, this proposal seeks to:\n\nAdd public decollateralize() & recollateralize() functions to all future AMO deployments that can be called by any user outside of the peg bounds to restore the FRAX peg trustlessly.\n\nAllow for \"Comptrollers\" to conduct monetary policy as long as the FRAX peg remains in the bounds 1.01 - .99 as defined by the Uniswap FRAX-USDC & FRAX3CRV TWAPs (and future FRAX-USD Chainlink oracle). Outside of peg bounds, all CR updates, AMO recollateralize() & decollateralize() functions are callable by anyone. ",

      "content": "FIP - 14 - Re-propose prior FIP for purchasing ETH with AMO profits when FXS price trades above $1.50\n\nAuthor\n\nMark11/Capt - Community Members (resubmission of a prior FIP authored by Sam Kazemian)\n\nSummary\n\nRedirect the 50% of FXS1559 burns to purchase ETH on Uniswap and place it in FXS-ETH LP - only when FXS trades above $1.50 - for a trial period of 60 days. After 60 days, the community can vote to extend this ETH purchase program or re-instate burns. This would be a trial run to see how reinvesting AMO profits into the protocol goes.  \n\nBackground\n\nSam Kazemian previously authored FIP 2 which passed with 92%, however, as FRAX governance was in its infancy, it had low turnout and was therefore not executed.\n\nAfter further discussions within the community we believe it is time to revisit this proposal and determine if it has broad support through re-proposing it for a snapshot vote.\n\nAbstract\n\nIf adopted, this proposal seeks to route 50% of the AMO profits that are currently going to burning FXS to purchasing protocol owned ETH for 60 days. The ETH will continually be placed in FXS-ETH LP through an AMO. The LP is not eligible to earn any farming rewards so it would not be competitive in any way with community rewards. Currently there is no FXS rewards for any FXS-ETH pair, but if there was, the FXS-ETH AMO would not be eligible for FXS yields so it would not be competitive with farmers. Additionally the mechanism would only operate when FXS is trading above $1.50 - when it is trading at or below $1.50 the purchasing of ETH would be switched off until FXS trades above $1.50 again.\n\nMotivation\n\nA prior governance proposal created by Justin Bram and Brazy.eth successfully passed to reroute 50% of AMO profits to veFXS holders and we considered it very successful for the protocol. This current FXS-ETH proposal was inspired by YFI’s similar idea of “own the land on which we operate” posted here: Own The Land (Eth) On Which We Operate - Finance - yearn.finance 2\n\nSam believes (and we agree) reinvesting part of the AMO profits back into the protocol itself could yield just as much of a success if not more. This 60-day trial period is ideal and does not commit to changing the FXS1559 dynamic other than accruing more FXS-ETH liquidity which is a great way to trial increase FXS value in this way. Additionally, if FXS1559 burns are re-instated, a governance proposal can be made to simply use the accrued ETH to burn the FXS itself which would retroactively create a similar amount of deflationary pressure for FXS if desired.\n\nThe FXS price floor guarantee of $1.50 to switch off this mechanism and channel back to full burns - is to provide confidence to FXS holders that the full burn will be reinstated when FXS token price is low. \n\nRisks\n\nThere is a risk that the price of ETH crashes making the purchased ETH-FXS less valuable than other opportunities. The length of the trial should mitigate any substantial impact of this occurring.\n\nVoting\n\nFor: support the purchasing of ETH with one quarter of the total AMO profits (coming out of the portion currently burning FXS) - and depositing to FXS-ETH LP pair through an AMO for 60 day trial period. Approving this proposal would make AMO profits distribution as follows: 25% burn FXS, 25% purchase ETH, 50% distributed to veFXS. This mechanism will be programmatically switched off whenever FXS trades at or below $1.50 and instead will use the portion to continue FXS burns until price returns above $1.50. \n\nAgainst: no change at this time",

To attract liquidity to the D4 pool, incentives will be proposed by each protocol in the form of their governance token as staking rewards for the pool LP token: FXS, ALCX, LQTY, and TRIBE. This will allow holders of the assets in the decentralized stablecoin pool to swap between each other with minimal slippage.\n\nCurrently, liquidity between these stablecoins is fragmented across decentralized exchanges Uniswap V2, Uniswap V3, and Curve.fi. By putting them together in a saddle pool, it will not only link the stablecoins to each other but also create cross-dex swap infrastructure through these assets.\n\n\n**If adopted**, this proposal seeks to:\n1. Incentivize the Saddle D4 pool with 1200 FXS/day\n2. Coordinate with other decentralized stablecoin protocols to maintain liquidity rewards\n\nThis **benefits Frax** as a whole by:\n* Creating a native pool to swap between FRAX, alUSD, LUSD, and FEI\n* Promoting cross-dex swaps by dex aggregators through FRAX",

      "content": "**Author**\nSam Kazemian\n\nSummary\nRedirect the 50% of FXS1559 burns to purchase ETH from Uniswap and place it in FXS-ETH LP for 60 days. After 60 days, community can vote to extend this ETH purchase program indefinitely or re-instate burns. This would be a trial run to see how reinvesting AMO profits into the protocol goes. \n\n**Abstract**\nIf adopted, this proposal seeks to route 50% of the AMO profits that are currently going to burning FXS to purchasing protocol owned ETH for 60 days. The ETH is then continually placed in FXS-ETH LP through an AMO. The LP is not eligible to earn any farming rewards so it would not be competitive in any way with community rewards. Currently there is no FXS rewards for any FXS-ETH pair, but if there was, the FXS-ETH AMO would not be eligible for FXS yields so it would not be competitive with farmers. \n\n\n**Motivation**\nA prior governance proposal created by Justin Bram and Brazy.eth successfully passed to reroute 50% of AMO profits to veFXS holders and was a huge success. This current FXS-ETH proposal was inspired by YFI's similar idea of \"own the land on which we operate\" posted here: https://gov.yearn.finance/t/own-the-land-eth-on-which-we-operate/10802 \n\nI believe reinvesting part of the AMO profits back into the protocol itself could yield just as much of a success if not more. This 60 day trial period is ideal and does not commit to changing the FXS1559 dynamic other than accruing more FXS-ETH liquidity which is a great way to increase FXS value. Additionally, if FXS1559 burns are re-instated, a governance proposal can be made to simply use the accrued ETH to burn the FXS itself which would retroactively create a similar amount of deflationary pressure for FXS if desired. So I believe either way this proposal is a good idea.  \n",

Instead, we propose to redirect 50% of AMO profits to buyback and distribute FXS to veFXS holders. \n\n\nMotivation\nThis proposal is motivated by lack of incentive for people to vote-lock their FXS. By adding these rewards, community members will be incentivized to participate in protocol governance. \n\nveFXS follows the Curve Finance vote-lock model. veCRV holders currently receive 50% of trading fees from the protocol. At this time, partially due to these incentives, about 50% of CRV supply is vote-locked into veCRV for an average of 3.65 years. We propose to follow a similar reward structure, and hopefully see similar success for the Frax protocol. ",

      "title": "veFXS: Single-Asset FXS Staking",
      "content": "## Authors\nFrax Finance Team\n\n## Summary\nApprove vote boosts and yield for FXS single-asset staking as veFXS\n\n## Background \nveFXS is a fork of Curve’s veCRV code. Users may lock up their FXS for up to 4 years for four times the amount of veFXS (e.g. 100 FXS locked for 4 years returns 400 veFXS). The veFXS balance linearly decreases as tokens approach their lock expiry, approaching 1 veFXS per 1 FXS at zero lock time remaining. This encourages long-term staking and an active community. Sushiswap has proposed a similar implementation with their recently announced [oSushi token](https://forum.sushi.com/t/sushinomics-introducing-osushi/4055) A sample graph (Curve’s veCRV) illustrating the decrease can be found at this [address](https://dao.curve.fi/locker).\n\n## Purpose\nThe purpose of veFXS is to reward long-term FXS hodlers and incentivize farmers to stake FXS. \n\nThe functionality of veFXS is described as follows:\n\n# Voting Power\nEach veFXS will have 1 vote in governance proposals. Staking 1 FXS for the maximum time, 4 years, would generate 4 veFXS. This veFXS balance itself will slowly decay down to 1 veFXS after 4 years, at which time the user can redeem the veFXS back for FXS. In the meantime, the user can also increase their veFXS balance by locking up FXS, extending the lock end date, or both. It should be noted that veFXS is non-transferable.\n\n# Farming Boosts\nHolding veFXS will give the user more weight when collecting farming rewards. The overall emission will remain the same. Curve has their max at 2.5x and we propose the same.[[1]](https://resources.curve.fi/faq/vote-locking-boost)[[2]](https://resources.curve.fi/guides/boosting-your-crv-rewards)\n\n# Yield\nAfter the implementation of veFXS, holders may be able to collect rewards periodically. The emission rate would vary, depending on the implementation of how the yield is obtained and market price of FXS.\n\n# Future Functionality \nThe veFXS system is modular and all-purpose. In the future, it can be expanded to vote on AMO weights, earn additional yield in new places/features, and be treated as a governance token-like bond of sorts.\n\n**If adopted**, this proposal seeks to:\n1. Give veFXS voting rights\n2. Have future farms (e.g. Uniswap v3) include a reward weight boost to veFXS holders\n\nThis **benefits Frax** as a whole by:\n* Allocate voting power to long-term holders of FXS through veFXS\n* Incentivizing farmers to stake FXS\n",

      "content": "## Authors\nFrax Finance Team\n\n## Summary\nMove the FRAX3CRV-f metapool LP tokens to the Frax Investor Custodian EOA to obtain boosted CRV yields.\n\n## Motivation \nCurve's Locker contract is the contract used for locking CRV to get veCRV votes. Externally owned accounts may generate veCRV as they wish, but smart contract accounts must be whitelisted in order to be able to generate veCRV votes and participate in Curve governance [source](https://github.com/curvefi/curve-dao-contracts/blob/master/contracts/VotingEscrow.vy#L190). The whitelisting process is unrelated to normal Curve listing, and we are unsure at what point we can get whitelisted. As a result, we propose to move all of the Frax metapool LP tokens to a team-controlled EOA to get the 2.5x boost on CRV yields on the Frax gauge as a voter, and lock the farmed CRV for more veCRV to vote for higher Frax gauge weights. Our updated Curve AMO contract implementation that supports this logic can be found [here](https://github.com/FraxFinance/frax-solidity/blob/master/contracts/Curve/CurveAMO_V2_Non_Impl.sol)\n\n\n**If adopted**, this proposal seeks to:\n1. Move the metapool LP tokens to the Frax Investor Custodian EOA from the updated Curve AMO\n2. Deposit the LP tokens into the FRAX gauge to receive a boost in CRV yields\n3. Vote-lock the CRV yields for veCRV\n4. Use the veCRV to vote for higher Frax gauge weights\n\nThis **benefits Frax** as a whole by:\n* Increasing Frax gauges by voting for them with the CRV generated by the metapool LP tokens\n* Boosting the CRV generated by the metapool LP tokens",

      "content": "## Authors\nFrax Finance Team\n\n## Summary\n\nChange Collateral Ratio (CR) Boost on Farming Rewards to 1x (no boost).\n\n## Abstract\n\nIf adopted, this proposal seeks to:\n1. Change cr_boost_max_multiplier on the FRAX-USDC, FRAX-FXS, and FRAX-WETH staking rewards contracts to 1e6 (1000000 with 6 decimals of precision = 1x boost)\n\nThis benefits Frax as a whole by:\n* Lowering emissions from a current rate of 56,000 FXS/day at a 86.50% CR, negatively correlated to the CR, to a constant 49,315 FXS/day. This also benefits farmers and locked stakers because the CR boost was a uniform boost across all emissions, so with it paused, it means that only locked stakers earn any kind of bonus boost. Their proportion of boosted emission increases since unlocked stakers do not earn any kind of boost (currently they earn CR boost). \n\n## Motivation \n\nThis proposal is motivated by the current high amount of FXS rewards emitted per day by the staking contracts. By turning off the CR boost, the protocol would slow down emissions, extending the duration of the yield farming program and easing selling pressure on the FXS price from farmers. The likely rise in demand+scarcity of FXS would most likely keep farming yields the comparable, if not better. It also tips the balance in favor of locked LPs since that is the only way to earn any form of boosted rewards. \n\nLiquidity is still important, so we propose to keep locked stakes as-is. Additionally, this makes locked stakers earn the only kind of boost in the entire ecosystem. This proposal would not affect rewards already distributed.",
