      "content": "Dear EVMavericks,\n\nOur treasury wallet already plays a pivotal role in supporting the decentralization of Ethereum by holding rETH, a great move! However, as we progress with our endeavors in the Ethereum network, it's essential to also consider our long-term commitment with layer 0, namely with the core contributors.\n\nAligned with the beliefs of the EVMavericks community, we anticipate the continued appreciation of ETH in the years to come. In light of this, I propose a proactive measure: initiating a donation from our treasury funds, inspired by the 'Protocol Guild Pledge'.\n\nSpecifically, I suggest allocating 1%-10% of our treasury as an annual contribution each year starting now.\n\nThis initiative not only underscores our commitment to Ethereum, but more importantly it shows we support the core people. It's crucial to recognize that these individuals could readily opt for ventures focused solely on monetary returns. Instead, they stand with Ethereum, demonstrating a profound commitment to its principles and vision. And THAT is something we need to support.\n\nLet us collectively embrace this opportunity to give back and strengthen the very foundation upon which Ethereum thrives.\n\nIf the vote passes, the current signers will donate the most voted percentage of our treasury to the official donation address of The Protocol Guild.\n\n[Official Protocol Guild Website](https://protocol-guild.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)\n[Etherscan: EVM Treasury](https://etherscan.io/tokenholdings?a=0x29816f59f1c7e1ba69289cf486556929f7743ca2)",

      "title": "Should ManeNet DAO pursue membership in Rocket Pool's oDAO?",
      "content": "This is a proposal asking whether ManeNet DAO should pursue becoming a member of Rocket Pool's oDAO.\n\nRocket Pool, a decentralized Ethereum staking pool, requires oracle services in order to function. This includes passing information about the state of the Beacon Chain and validators on it back into Rocket Pool's smart contracts on the execution side, which currently cannot be done entirely on-chain. Rocket Pool solves this problem with the oDAO, a collection of trusted entities who run software to perform these tasks, as well as performing certain administrative functions. Members also have an important responsibility in voting on Rocket Pool's governance proposals, including upgrades to the protocol. oDAO members receive a not insignificant portion of the total RPL inflation as compensation for their work.\n\nManeNet DAO, with its mission of advancing the decentralized Ethereum Web3 ecosystem by aligning shared member incentives with funding, developing, and promoting public goods and education, may be ideally placed to become a decentralized member of the oDAO. We would need to explore what that would entail, and then to approach the existing oDAO members with a proposal for how we could join. Being invited to join would not be guaranteed. However, \n\nFor context, u/Ethical-trade recently proposed this idea, and u/waqwaqattack, a core Rocket Pool community member and producer of the Rocket Fuel podcast, has expressed great enthusiasm for it, and even offered to lend sufficient RPL to cover the oDAO bond that we would need to post, if we were to be selected. \nhttps://old.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/136avsi/daily_general_discussion_may_3_2023/jipex7f/\n\nBefore proceeding, we would like to establish whether EVMs support this or not. Please vote YES if you are in favor of us pursuing joining the Rocket Pool oDAO, NO if you oppose it, or ABSTAIN if you for whatever reason would like to do so. Approval will be by simple majority. \n\nThank you!",

      "title": "Stewardship Proposal",
      "content": "**Overview**\nThis is a revised version of the Financial Stewardship Proposal (https://snapshot.org/#/evmaverick.eth/proposal/0x876e5da1b8d6450acb4f5c80ecfaf709791bff1fc611fe5f3c102dae092c47d0), originally accepted by the DAO via snapshot vote on 06/23/2022. As per the terms in the approved proposal, the stewardship system was set to automatically expire after an initial trial period unless re-approved by the DAO, potentially with modifications.\n\nThis proposal would continue the stewardship system with continuity in the current set of stewards, and modifications to the proposal text to reflect the changing roles and duties the stewards have taken. In particular, the text incorporates the following changes:\n- Lengthening of financial periods from three to six months;\n- Description of the 3/5 Stewards multisig, as described in https://snapshot.org/#/evmaverick.eth/proposal/0xde917ae35ca7b5d4eaf6f6b57c5e46ae292d7ea9d76e6dc01d7a9ddce91034fb;\n- Removal of quorum requirements on votes in exchange for a high 75% approval threshold;\n- Naming changes (renaming financial stewards to stewards) and working group formation responsibilities; and\n- If a steward is removed or vacates their seat out-of-cycle, filling the seat with a Discord moderator until the next regular vote.\n\n\n**Summary**\n- Stewards are five elected DAO members who oversee a discretionary budget from the treasury.\n- Bi-annual Snapshot votes elect stewards and determine the overall treasury allocation.\n- Stewards oversee public treasury records, direct discretionary spending, pursue funding, submit budget proposals, and organize treasury-related votes.\n- The 7/11 ManeNet DAO multisig holds the vast majority of the DAOs funds. The 3/5 Stewards multisig holds a minority of the funds. \n- Steward terms last two periods, and are staggered. If a steward relinquishes their position or is unseated by Snapshot vote, a special election will be held to choose a new steward for the remainder of the period. \n\n\n**Introduction**\nThis is a proposal for ManeNet DAO’s treasury and budget management structure. The intent is to provide a framework allowing the DAO to more easily put its treasury to use in service of its goals. This framework works on the lessons learned from the trial period and subsequent period in 2022. This proposal focuses on two concepts: Stewards and financial periods:\n\nStewards (or simply stewards) are a group of five DAO members elected by the DAO to oversee its finances. Notably, stewards are delegated authority from the DAO to manage its discretionary budget, held in a 3/5 stewards’ multisig, intended to fund smaller expenses without need for separate Snapshot votes.\n\nFinancial periods are six months long (bi-annual); in each financial period the DAO holds a Snapshot vote to determine both the allocation of assets in its treasury and the discretionary budget allocated to the stewards.\n\nThe Snapshot vote for this proposal, and all snapshot votes described in this document will have no minimum quorum requirement. Basic for/against and approval votes will require a 75% threshold for acceptance, in order to ensure widespread agreement even when participation is low. Instant runoff ranked choice votes must include an option to reject all other proposed options to similarly ensure consensus. A proposal should run for a minimum of 7 days to be valid.\n\n**Stewards**\nIn total, the DAO will elect and maintain a group of five stewards. Stewards serve for a term covering two financial periods but may apply and be elected for additional terms. Two existing members are selected to step down early at the end of the financial period, with their seats opening for reelection for terms beginning with the next financial period. Thus, terms are staggered, with 2-3 seats requiring reelections each financial period (detailed below).\n\nThe responsibilities of the stewards are as follows:\n- Oversee the DAO’s finances, keeping up-to-date records on income, expenses, and treasury status, making this information accessible to DAO members;\n- Collectively direct the DAO’s discretionary budget, with authority delegated from the DAO to manage smaller expenses on its behalf (i.e. without a Snapshot vote);\n- Make payments from a 3/5 multisig held by the stewards in accordance with their other responsibilities;\n- Actively seek out potential funding opportunities that align with the DAO’s goals;\n- Provide official recommendations regarding the DAO’s finances to the broader ManeNet community; \n- Organize the Snapshot votes for steward elections and treasury/budget allocations prior to each financial period; and\n- Organize, oversee, and incentivize working groups\n\nStewards’ funding decisions include, but are not limited to: donations, grants, bounties, and retroactive funding. This proposal places few requirements on how the stewards carry out their responsibilities. Additionally, discussion between stewards occurs in two spaces: one public Discord channel for sharing updates, taking feedback and vetting ideas, one private channel for brainstorming early stage ideas, communicating sensitive information or investment decisions that are at the risk of being front run. Aside from these restrictions, stewards may organize as they see fit.\n\nIf the DAO finds that a steward is not fulfilling their responsibilities, any DAO member may submit a Snapshot vote calling for the removal of that steward. The vote will be conducted as a basic for/against vote. If the vote passes, the steward should be immediately removed from their position, and a Discord mod will take over the vacant position. Afterwards, a special election will be held to fill the vacancy. The replacement steward serves only for the remainder of the removed steward’s term. A similar solution can be used when a steward quits voluntarily.\n\n**Financial periods**\nFinancial periods are half a year long, beginning on the 1st of January and the 1st of July. \n\nIn each financial period, a Snapshot vote determines what should be done with the DAO’s treasury funds. The stewards are expected to produce a report on the DAO’s finances, along with their recommendations for how to proceed. They then solicit and aggregate financial period proposals from the community and create a ranked-choice Snapshot vote, with the winning proposal being adopted for its financial period. A financial period proposal consists of:\n\n- Asset allocation for the entire treasury, may allocate to illiquid options such as RP minipools;\n- A discretionary budget to be assigned to the stewards;\n- Flat monetary compensation to the stewards themselves; and\n- Any additional guidance for the stewards or multisig signers.\n\nAsset allocation and budget may be static (e.g. X ETH) or dynamic (e.g. rebalancing percentages, dependent on revenue, or conditional on future events). Snapshot votes may be submitted during a quarter to alter a previously-approved by a financial period proposal, and should be held as a basic for/against vote in approval in order to pass. Stewards’ monetary compensation should be disbursed at the end of the period evenly between the stewards, and in the event a steward was replaced during the period, both the original and the replacement will be compensated pro rata.\n\nThe end of each financial period involves a series of steps to prepare for the following financial period:\n\n- Five weeks prior to the end of the period, stewards should begin collecting applications for the steward seats requiring reelection.\n- Three weeks out, stewards should initiate a week-long Snapshot approval-vote to elect replacement stewards.\n- Two weeks out, stewards should begin collecting financial period proposals from the community and creating their own.\n- One week out, stewards should initiate a week-long Snapshot ranked-choice vote to select the financial period proposal to put into effect.\n- On the date the new financial period begins, the multisig executes any actions indicated by the selected financial period proposal, and stewardship is passed from those whose terms are expiring to those who had been newly elected.\n\n",

      "title": "EVM Distribution Phase 2, Vote 2",
      "content": "The EVMavericks multisig currently owns 56 EVM NFTs (35 of them - OGs). These EVMs were left over after the two rounds of the initial distribution to r/ethfinance members. They are not currently allocated for any specific purpose, though as holdings of the DAO they should be used in service to our mission statement. In discussions concerning them, it has frequently been suggested to use these to grow the DAO and stimulate activity, leading to gains in the strength of our community. This produces a compounding return, in which we will be be better able to achieve our goal to \"advance the decentralized Ethereum Web3 ecosystem by aligning shared member incentives with funding, developing, and promoting public goods and education.\"\n\nIn the preliminary emoji vote that we ran on Discord, most votes coalesced around us attempting to tie in EVMavericks NFT giveaways to bigger events, such as EVM anniversary, Permissionless, ETHDenver, etc. \n\nThe current vote is to decide on how we'll approach voting for the distribution channels in order to minimize bias and chance of it being \"played\". \n\nIn our Discord discussions, the following options have been proposed:\n\n## **1. The Flexible Approach**\nFor our first vote, we choose 5 ideas that have so far emerged in our discussions, and vote for 2 best. This lets us focus on implementing our second idea right after the first (or do them simultaneously like Ethereum development itself) without having to return to the same discussions. In the meanwhile, we gather new ideas in Discord to present for the next occasion that comes up. To take Shanghai update as an example, we could gather 5 ideas that tie in well with the update — for example, do a raffle for people that show on-chain proof of their switching from centralized staking (which they've been a part of for X months to eliminate the chance of it being \"played\") to decentralized staking, to promote decentralization; then vote on it, and execute. And in case a great opportunity/event/idea comes up, we may run another proposal for some additional EVM to be given away. The beauty of this approach is that we stay flexible while also not having to waste too much time on back-and-forth, and minimize potential bias & gameability. \n###### With this approach, the votes of the year 2023 would look like this: \nVote 1: 5 proposals, 2 ideas to implement.\nVote 2: 5 proposals, 1 idea to implement.\nVote 3: 5 proposals, 1 idea to implement.\nAnd so on, until we distribute all the EVMs that we have agreed on in **EVM Distribution Phase 2, Vote 2**. \n\n## **2. The Thorough Approach**\nIn this option, any idea that is proposed about how we want to give away an EVM should be voted on on a case-by-case basis via a snapshot vote as the year goes on. The purpose of using this approach is to vet out each idea being proposed with descriptive reasoning, much more so than a single vote with multiple choices would allow. With lots of ideas flowing around, this approach allows every EVM member to vote with \"informed consent\" on what is happening with every EVM in the treasury that is being given away. \nTo be clear, this would require a snapshot vote for every type of EVM giveaway we plan on doing in the future. The reason for this is that EVMs are worth a lot, and we should make sure that anything that comes out of our Treasury is decided on a mutual consensus every single time. This option might relieve worries that ideas weren't voted on fairly because each giveaway idea will be voted on separately.\nThe con of this approach is that a simple \"for\" and \"against\" vote for a proposal can lead people to accepting a sub-par option based solely on the fact that a person would rather see an EVM distributed through a sub-par channel than not distributed at all. Additionally, it will limit the amount of discussions and potential ideas due to the fact that we will not be forced to gather 5 ideas for each snapshot vote and — as it happens in the DAO — are likely to go choose the path of least resistance. \n###### With this approach, the votes of the year 2023 would look like this: \nVote 1: 1 proposal, yes/no\nVote 2: 1 proposal, yes/no\nVote 3: 1 proposal, yes/no\nAnd so on, until we distribute all the EVMs that we have agreed on in **EVM Distribution Phase 2, Vote 2**. \n\n## **3. The Idea List Approach**\nIn this option, we come together with all of our ideas (~10) and assemble a list for potential EVM giveaways at the beginning of each year. Then we put every idea from the list in a single snapshot vote, each with a description of what it's about and why we should do it. We then have the snapshot vote constructed similar to how the vote was for the Stewards election, where we had a list of names and people voted for their favorite person or whoever they thought was best for the Steward role, but in this case they would vote for their favorite ideas. Then whatever those top 5 ideas are will be the ones that are selected and used for the EVM giveaways throughout the year.\nThe con of voting for for all distribution channels well in advance is that the distribution could be gamed. As a rough example, if we all agree that r/ethfinance should receive an EVM via raffle, or the \"best\" contributor is to be rewarded, somebody could create a new account and have enough time to \"establish\" their second account to boost their chances.\n###### With this approach, the votes of the year 2023 would look like this: \nVote 1: 10 proposals, 5 ideas to implement. (or however many we decide on in **EVM Distribution Phase 2, Vote 2**)\nAnd that would be the only vote for the year. \n\nPlease vote on the approach you feel would suit us best, and if you have something better in your mind, make sure to share it in #ideas.

      "content": "The EVMavericks multisig currently owns 56 EVM NFTs (35 of them - OGs). These EVMs were left over after the two rounds of the initial distribution to r/ethfinance members. They are not currently allocated for any specific purpose, though as holdings of the DAO they should be used in service to our mission statement. In discussions concerning them, it has frequently been suggested to use these to grow the DAO and stimulate activity, leading to gains in the strength of our community. This produces a compounding return, in which we will be be better able to achieve our goal to \"advance the decentralized Ethereum Web3 ecosystem by aligning shared member incentives with funding, developing, and promoting public goods and education.\"\n\nIt is high time we made use of these NFTs. With 35 OG lions in the treasury, it leaves plenty of room for us to try out different approaches to marketing, community growth, etc. The current vote aims to establish the amount of EVMs we will be giving away (if any). You might have voted for it already in Discord, but it was decided to run it once again to formalize it. \n\nIf you wish to learn more about this proposal, please read https://rentry.co/who7ge\n\nPlease vote for all the choices that you agree with.",

      "title": "Stewards Proposal re: Direction & Structure (The Future)",
      "content": "BACKGROUND\n\nThe EVMavericks is a young DAO/project, but in the short time we have been in existence, we have already accomplished a lot:\n\nDefined Mission - Public Goods, Education, Decentralization\nStructure - Established Mods, Multisig Signers & Financial Stewards\nGitcoin Grant, Ethstaker Campaign\nEVMavericks Podcast\nDegen/Alpha Channel\nLots of tangential projects: Ratio Gang, EIPandas, RocketPool Nodes\n\nThat being said, one of the biggest challenges for a community-led organization is effective organization and the ability to make effective and efficient decisions. No for-profit company of comparable size (approximately 1,000 persons) would be able to operate with only five managers, nor would they be able to operate with all 1,000 employees making decisions.\n\nTo that end, we would like to propose a general structure to aid us in making decisions and getting things done more quickly moving forward.\n\nSTRUCTURE\n\nWe would like to assemble smaller teams that would have purview over specific goals. Some of the initial teams that would be formed could include: communications/marketing, technology and development, finance, external collaborations, and long-term planning.\n\nExamples of a couple of projects that these teams/sub-groups could immediately begin working on are:\n\nDev Team: Get EVMs verified on OpenSea. Fix metadata issues. Look at taking artwork on-chain. \n\nFinance Team: Divide treasury funds into short-term and long-term plays. Define allocations and goals for each.\n\nThere are still lots of minor decisions that would need to be made:\n\nHow many subgroups are needed? What will the makeup of these groups look like? How will their performance be evaluated?\n\nThis proposal is not to iron out all of these details but simply to agree that this is the direction we want to go in.\n\nCOMPENSATION\n\nOne of the other significant challenges that a grassroots organization faces is funding, both for the organization and for projects that we would desire to fund.\n\nTo that end, we would like to propose a basic compensation strategy for those that forward the DAO’s goals in an exemplary manner.\n\nSince it is not always possible or prudent to pay for the completion of all projects and/or tasks up front, and at the same time, it is not reasonable to ask all DAO members to work for free on all projects, we propose that compensation be primarily retroactive and proportional to the positive effect the work has.\n\nIn other words, the members of a team working on a significant project may receive a small sum from the treasury to bootstrap the project. At the end of the project, the team may be rewarded with a percentage of the recurring revenues from that project. A good example would be a collaboration with a game developer which results in the DAO receiving a significant portion of said game’s revenue in perpetuity. The team which negotiated the collaboration may be awarded a (relatively minor) portion of those revenues as compensation for their time and efforts. In this way, we would not be rewarding members simply for task completion but rather for their effectiveness.\n\nThis is simply one example. Other methods could also be used. For instance, the awarding of EVMs from the treasury or the creation of Honorary EVMs that are not part of the main collection but are awarded for significant achievements that further our mission.\n\nOnce again, this proposal is not to iron out all of these details but simply to agree that this is the direction we want to go in as a DAO.\n\nFORMAL PROPOSAL\n\nWHEREAS, The EVMavericks / ManeNet DAO has already accomplished many significant goals in its first year in existence, all while lacking a significant source of external funding; and\n\nWHEREAS, The DAO wishes to accomplish its goals of forwarding public goods causes, education, and decentralization in the most efficient and effective way possible; now, therefore, be it\n\nPROPOSED, That the EVMavericks' Financial Stewards be empowered to create several smaller teams to aid in effectively accomplishing the DAO’s larger goals;\n\nPROPOSED, That the exact details regarding the specific purposes and makeup of these teams be left to the discretion of the Financial Stewards;\n\nPROPOSED, That the means of compensating the members of these teams be left to the discretion of the Financial Stewards; and \n\nPROPOSED, That the name of the EVMavericks' Financial Stewards be changed to Stewards to reflect that they are responsible not just for the DAO's funds but also its mission and vision (which may oftentimes be non-financial in nature).",

      "title": "Steward September 2022 Proposal 3 Treasury Funds",
      "content": "This is a vote to determine if DAO members approve of the proposal below. This proposal will be approved with a simple majority (>50%) voting in favor of the proposal. \n\nThis proposal is focused on the allocation of the Treasury funds.\n\nAllocation of the Treasury funds\nCurrently,  we have around 34 ETH ($47,600 with a $1400 ETH price) in the Treasury. As was made clear in our latest announcement in Discord, we still think reserving funds as compensation/reward for the stewards is not something we will ask for right now. In our opinion a (financial) reward should be paid retroactively. All the funds under custody of the stewards will be used to grow the DAO and help towards our mission statement. \n\nThe stewards propose the following allocation of our Treasury’s funds:\n- 50% of the ETH is converted into rETH. \nrETH is a non-custodial liquid staking derivative from the Rocket Pool network. ETH deposits are matched with distributed node operators who stake on your behalf. rETH automatically accrues value based on staking rewards, which gives the DAO the possibility to passively increase the Treasury’s total value. \nFor more information see: https://docs.rocketpool.net/guides/staking/overview.html#the-reth-token  \n- 30% of the ETH is going to the ManeNet DAO Investment Portfolio run by a stewards owned multisig.  To be clear, a separate proposal will be put forth as to the possible structure of the portfolio once this initial allocation vote is passed. A good example of an asset we could look at is something like RPL, a token that a significant amount of our community appears to believe in/stand behind. \n- 10% of the ETH is reserved as discretionary funds for the stewards. These funds can be used for public good grants or any other allocation the DAO sees value and potential in. A separate proposal will be put forth as to the possible structure of the allocations once the DAO together with the stewards have produced a proposal.\n- 5% of the ETH is going to a fast-paced portfolio run by community members . This will be a fun experiment with the goal of driving community engagement as well as trying to see if our degens can grow this portfolio by making agile investment decisions. This portfolio also gives the DAO the possibility to invest in NFT’s. The exact details around this portfolio are still up for discussion. Please see the following discussion for background information or to contribute ideas: https://discord.com/channels/963992696387694592/966528703674851378/1011935013731831828 \n- 5% of the ETH is used for retroactive grants for valuable contributions to our DAO. Please contact the stewards if you feel there’s a contribution deserving of a grant. Have an idea for how we can further the ideals and mission of our community by funding some work within the DAO? Please share these as well. \n- It’s looking like our DAO is becoming eligible for the $SAFE airdrop with an allocation of 1932 SAFE. Under the motto “if we wouldn’t buy it, we shouldn’t hold it” we want to propose to exchange the whole allocation to ETH within the week of the token becoming tradable. \n- The Stake-a-Thon funds ($19,579) will stay reserved for the Stake-a-Thon and will be allocated to that project when a Snapshot vote regarding distribution of the funds has been accepted by the DAO.\n\nNew Treasury in figures:\n- 17 rETH\n- 10.2 ETH for the ManeNet DAO Investment Portfolio \n- 3.4 ETH discretionary funds for the stewards.\n- 1.7 ETH for the agile community members run portfolio.\n- 1.7 ETH for retroactive grants within the DAO.\n\nThe ManeNet DAO Investment Portfolio will be run by a newly created 3/5 multisig run by the stewards.\n\nPlease vote either For if you want this proposal to be passed, Abstain if you hold back your vote or Against if you don't want this proposal to be passed. \n",

This proposal will be approved with a simple majority (>50%) voting in favor of the proposal.\nThe proposal is for a (1) Statement of Alignment and (2) Approval of Logo Use.\n\n1) Alignment: \n\nManeNet DAO to become signatories on a letter stating our desire to make Ethereum a climate-positive chain by working to offset Ethereum’s historic emissions. Specifically it would be a request to sign statement to be published as a Mirror NFT started by Ben West from Gitcoin & Dave from LOA Labs then subsequently edited by the EthZERO discord. The Statement is pasted below.\n\nRequested ACTION: ManeNet DAO multisig signs & amplifies \n\nRequested ACTION: individuals sign & amplify \n\n\n2) Approval of Logo Use: \n\nManeNet DAO approves the use of ManeNet DAO logo / name on promotional information / websites to EthZERO effort.\nExamples: name/logo at the bottom of https://0xaurelius.github.io/merge4climate/ or on twitter posts\n\nRequested ACTION: approval\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAbout EthZERO \nEthZERO: A group of individuals passionate about crypto x climate collaborating to make Ethereum a climate-positive chain. Discord -- https://discord.gg/ZWY2Mxb5aM\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSign-on Statement in Support of Ethereum's “Merge” \n\nPositive Climate Impacts of this Energy Efficiency Transition \n\nWe, the undersigned, would like to congratulate the teams responsible for successfully accomplishing Ethereum's transition to “proof-of-stake” today! \n\nThis change (also known as “The Merge”) will end the use of energy-intensive, warehouse scale, computer equipment that has been used up until now to secure Ethereum's blockchain transactions. \n\nThis transition will reduce the energy consumption of the Ethereum blockchain by an estimated 99.95%. \n\nThe “Merge”, is the successful merging of two separate blockchains, one that is energy intensive by design and another is energy efficient by design in order to switch the existing Ethereum blockchain to the more efficient option. \n\nThis achievement is arguably one of the most significant reductions of energy use and associated greenhouse gas emissions from any large industry in modern history.\n\n\nSome estimates of the greenhouse gases associated with one year of the Ethereum blockchain were approximately 43.3 million tons of CO2 equivalent. This transition is similar to removing the emissions the country of Switzerland annually and in perpetuity. \n\nWe applaud this historical achievement, as well as the community-led efforts already underway to use web3 tools and applications built on Ethereum and other energy efficient blockchains to go well beyond mitigating historic emissions and to become globally available open source infrastructure that underpins the verifiability and transparency essential to address the climate crisis.\n\n\nWe are hopeful that many organisations interested in the real world use cases of web3 technology who have hesitated to explore what is possible will now take a second look. \n\nTogether we can all play a role in charting a path forward for the responsible use of this innovative technology as a valuable tool and know that you are supporting energy efficient blockchain technology in the process.\n\nI am joining the international effort to go beyond offsetting and mitigating Ethereum’s historical carbon footprint and explore strategies for regenerative, net positive climate solutions.  Check out EthZERO on Discord.\n\nSincerely, \n\nSigned:\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n",

As was made clear in our latest announcement in Discord we still think reserving funds as compensation/reward for the stewards is not something we will ask for right now. In our opinion a (financial) reward should be paid retroactively. All the funds under custody of the stewards will be used to grow the DAO and help towards our mission statement. \n\nThe stewards propose the following allocation of our Treasury’s funds:\n- 50% of the ETH is converted into rETH.\n- 35% of the ETH is going to the ManeNet DAO Investment Portfolio which is split between the Investment Portfolio run by the stewards (30%) and the fast paced portfolio run by community members.\n- 10% of the ETH is reserved as discretionary funds for the stewards.\n- 5% of the ETH is used for retroactive grants for valuable contributions to our DAO.\n- It’s looking like our DAO is becoming eligible for the $SAFE airdrop with an allocation of 1932 SAFE. Under the motto “if we wouldn’t buy it, we shouldn’t hold it” we want to propose to exchange the whole allocation to ETH within the week of the token becoming tradable. \n\nNew Treasury in figures:\n- 9.5 rETH\n- 6.65 ETH for the Investment Portfolio: 5.7 ETH for the steward run portfolio and 0.95 ETH for the community members run portfolio.\n- 1.9 ETH discretionary funds for the stewards.\n- 0.95 ETH for retroactive grants within the DAO.\n\nThe ManeNet DAO Investment Portfolio will be run by a newly created 3/5 multisig run by the stewards.\n\nThe way the community run portfolio is run is still open for discussion. \n\nPlease vote either For if you want this proposal to be passed, Abstain if you hold back your vote or Against if you don't want this proposal to be passed. \n",

      "content": "EIPandas is an NFT project to celebrate the merge that has been in the works by danksharting for months now. See the merge pandas thread in discord for more details. \nThe mint isn't free, but it's minimally priced at 0.003675 eth ($5.50) with a 5875 supply, and the people who will be in the whitelist for mint are EVM holders, Beacon Chain Genesis Depositor POAP holders, etc. (more info in merge pandas channel). \n\nThis proposal is an official proposal to confirm if EVMavericks are good with the following:\n\nMint revenue gets split 50/50 - half to the DAO and half to Pandas International to adopt our very own panda + compensation for danksharting. So, the DAO would get 10.25 eth from mint, and at current eth prices, a ~6.3 eth donation to Pandas International, and roughly ~4 to Danksharting for cost/time reimbursement. Note, the donation to Pandas International will target $10k USD to cover the cost and care of a panda for one year, so Danksharting will get the remainder after the $10k is donated (could be more or less, he is willing to bet on the merge!).\n\nRoyalty revenue (7.5% per sale) goes 100% to the DAO minus Autominter's cut (0.375%), so the DAO would receive 7.125% of NFT value per sale. \n\nVote YES if you're OK with this proposed split\n\nVote NO if you feel it needs reworking (please comment in merge-pandas channel)\n\nThe deadline is short because the Merge is on the horizon and there's still lots of work to do. \n\n![IMG_4902.jpeg](ipfs://bafkreie7to7sewo3ypukkaw5lqjp2mb5gfbehx4b7sgo5ndvmkpuz22rue)\n    ",

I am currently upper management at a $100+ million company and manage the accounting/books for the company. I love this project and have given a lot of myself to it and would love to see us grow in a positive direction for years to come, wether that is fast and booming or slow and sustainable. Imo what we have here is great and our community will be here for years to come. Whatever I can do to help steward that responsibly would be an honor. As far as my \"investment\" approach, I am 75-80% conservative (holding mostly ETH/quality assets), with a 15-20% degen side (with the goal to increase ETH stack) and for transparency's sake, this is the approach I would carry forward into the stewardship role. Kisses hands, shakes babies\n\n### TheBenMeadows\nI have been in crypto since 2014 (ETH since 2016). While I participated by learning about and using the technology, I primarily sat quietly and observed in online forums for years. Since quitting my job as a VP running an $80M company last year, I have had more time to become active in the space.* I currently work as a full-time consultant and sit on the board of a small private equity company. I love the EVM community we have built and want to see it flourish for years to come. I would use the funds to invest in projects that are both high in quality and improve the space. Since this is a stewardship position, I would probably favor the 80/20 rule - 80% quality, conservative investments, and 20% risker, more lucrative bets. *Some of the ways I have gotten involved lately have been by writing an advisory whitepaper for an NFT project that was struggling (at their request), founding the ManeNet DAO BrightID Seed Group, giving educational presentations on blockchain/NFTs in my city, and assisting startups (for free) in the blockchain/NFT space by acting as an advisor. I just spent a week in NYC for NFT.NYC and ApeFest, and you can usually find me here in the #Alpha channels.\n\n### Luukiemans\n\nTL:DRoar: I am Luuk and I am currently in my last year of my bachelor in Entrepreneurship and Retail Management. I have a lot of knowledge regarding start-ups, marketing, finance and overall idea generation in both the traditional and the Web 3.0 world. It would be a great honor to serve this amazing group of like minded people as a Financial Steward. As a Financial Steward I would like to contribute in helping our ManeNet DAO to become a multi million dollar positive impact focused group regarding aspects like decentralization, public goods, education, carbon offset/sustainability and more by setting up and working out ideas for both our revenue streams and expenses whilst providing transparency and insights into our DAO's finances.\n\n------------------\nMy full application: I am Luuk and I am currently in my last year of my bachelor in Entrepreneurship and Retail Management. I have a lot of knowledge regarding start-ups, marketing, finance and overall idea generation in both the traditional and the Web 3.0 world. I am really looking forward to contributing to Web 3.0 full time. My main interests are DeFi, GameFi, NFT's and everything else surrounding Ethereum. It would be a great honor to serve this amazing group of like minded people as a Financial Steward. As a Financial Steward I would like to contribute in helping our ManeNet DAO to become a multi million dollar positive impact focused group regarding aspects like decentralization, public goods, education, carbon offset/sustainability and more. I would like to see our revenue stream grow in multiple ways and use that revenue stream to set up a public good powerhouse with three main pillars*: 60% for our three main pillars: public goods, education and decentralization. 30% for generating extra revenue and compounding our revenue so we always keep growing as a DAO. 10% for internal growth: Everything related to our DAO like website (features), extra art/NFT projects, rewarding exceptional contributions by fellow EVM's, paid collaborations and more. I see the Financial Stewardship as a way to set up and work out ideas regarding revenue and expenses whilst creating transparency and insight into our DAO's finances. This framework could help our DAO become a leading group in decentralization, education and public goods funding. *These percentages are subject to change and should be decided on collectively.\n\n### Sabishii\nI'm u/SabishiiFury, I've been an active member of r/ethfinance for 2 years now. You may know me from the discussion of EVM royalty caps, where I was one of the loudest and most downvoted voices for limiting the then-yet-uncapped profits of the collection's creator. With this said, I would like to nominate myself as a steward and a counter-balance to any possible degen cravings of other stewards*. My main focus would be finding ways to grow the DAO and its influence, and to have it earn revenue not through investing in other apps/degen activities, but by funding projects that come from within the community. I think that this way our core mission of funding public goods will not be compromised in favor of developing other revenue streams. *and to keep etheraider in check if he's chosen 😛\n\n### JBM\nHi I'm ... well ... You may know me from ... well ... anyway. I would like to nominate myself as a steward. I believe I would be the \"known unknown\" as a steward, as I am very good at introducing your designs to unpredictable chaos for complete A to B testing. I think at this point you know what I stand for, what I believe in, and what I think this community is capable of. I am also very frugal, the shirt I'm wearing is older than some of the members here. It's still good, I just keep zip-tying the holes together. I am even more frugal with other peoples money. Thank you for your time & consideration. Have a great day!\n\n### RisingPaw\nApplying as well to add another option. I'm RisingPaw, I discovered crypto in 2013 and have been hooked ever since by its potential. Regarding my background, I have been a freelance developer (fullstack) for more than a decade and recently started to actively learn web3/crypto to tackle some work in this exciting field. I'm currently living in Europe. This DAO changed my mind regarding NFTs that I used to disregard as collectible tokens and I think it would be really amazing if it ended up being a success, aka. have a positive and meaningful impact on our ecosystem. As a spontaneous collaboration of like-minded individuals with a shared common goal that is powered by crypto, it is really an exciting experiment that I want to be a part of. My modest contribution so far was to quickly build https://dao.evmavericks.xyz/ where anyone can find our values and goals. Regarding our finances, I think we should focus on creating safe and sustainable revenue streams that we can spend to fulfill our mission. I also think there is a big untapped potential to create value using our existing combined skills.\n\n### dkderek\nGreetings Lions, I humbly submit my application as a financial steward. I’ve been stacking ETH since 2017 and learned a lot of lessons along the way. My +20-year professional background is in software and technology. I am currently a senior leader for a global SaaS business with over $XXX M in revenue (ARR) and I am responsible for a budget of over $10 million annually. I am one of the first Rocket Pool node operators and currently run XX minipools. I hold strongly to the ideals of our community, with a key interest in a truly decentralized Ethereum. While I don’t consider myself a writer, I have written quite a few guides that have helped people in crypto. Search dkderek on Medium for a sample of my writing. I am extensive experience coordinating global technical teams to get shit done. I believe that EVMavericks is one of the strongest communities in the ecosystem and Mainnet will be an example of the good that DAOs can do. Bear markets are for building, so let’s see what we can do!\n\n### wallstreetli\nLions, I would also like to submit my application. I am based in Switzerland and (currently still) work in TradFi on the equity trading side covering institutional as well as corporate clients. I am into Ethereum since 2016 and I am so glad I found Ethfinance on Reddit with all its rabbit holes. For me it is the one place where people are actually talking about the technology and actual use cases instead of just price action. Thanks to the community I am staking most of my ETH and got into interesting utility NFTs. At work I try to educate colleagues and clients about blockchain. There is obviously still lots of skepticism in TradFi but the interest is definitely there and many are privately invested. On top of daily equity market color I started to send out lots of crypto related high quality news articles/comments and had good feedback. With this I hope to give back the blockchain community. Being part of the EVMavericks DAO would be my pleasure. 🦁\n\n### Dondochaka\nHi Lions! My background is in leading web2 software engineering teams in various consumer spaces, most recently fintech. I am interested in technical and human systems, especially finding hidden leverage points and using them to unlock more impact with less effort. As a financial steward, I will represent the point of view that currently, the best use of the DAO treasury is as fuel to accelerate the accomplishments of the DAO (including generating new revenue). I believe EVM members are extremely valuable, but mostly untapped resources who can be engaged via thoughtful incentives and who deserve recognition when they make contributions to the EVM and Ethereum communities. For example, retroactively rewarding the author of a grant application is a win-win!\n\n### ZombieBP\nHello, idk if it's too late to apply but here it goes. I bought my first 10 Ethereum when it was $10 each and then sold it all as soon as it went to $20, so trust me i'm really good at making financial decisions 🙃 . Just like everyone else here i've been interested in Crypto from a financial and technology standpoint since i've known about it. I'm a Web Developer by trade in the Web2 space, .NET Core Developer to be exact for my all Windows buddies out there. (I'll probably lose a few votes for saying that but oh well lol) But anyway, I've been truly engaged and wanting to see this DAO grow and expand. I believe there's not a lot of DAO's like us. It's been fun so far playing around in the degen-chat but I've really been wanting to step up our game and focus on things for the greater good of the space. Being a steward, I'd be willing to sacrifice my time and serve the EVMs to put us in the best spot moving forward from a financial as well as a growth perspective. Regardless if i become a steward or not, I'll be contributing and working with all of you one way or another to grow this community.",

      "title": "Financial Stewardship Proposal",
      "content": "## Summary\n\n* Financial stewards are five elected DAO members who oversee a discretionary budget from the treasury.\n* Quarterly Snapshot votes elect stewards and determine the overall treasury allocation.\n* This proposal will expire after a one-quarter trial period, unless reapproved by majority vote.\n* Stewards oversee public treasury records, direct discretionary spending, pursue funding, submit budget proposals, and organize treasury-related votes.\n* Quarterly budget proposals account for the entire treasury allocation and may consist of reserve assets, investments, discretionary funds, compensation to stewards, and formal guidance.\n* Stewards only have indirect custody of the discretionary budget, through the existing 7/11 multisig.\n* Stewards may allocate funds to donations, grants, bounties, and retroactive funding.\n* Steward terms last two quarters, and are staggered.\n* Stewards can be unseated by Snapshot vote at any time.\n\n## Introduction\n\nThis is a proposal for ManeNet DAO’s treasury and budget management structure. The intent is to provide an initial framework allowing the DAO to more easily put its treasury to use in service of its goals, as currently no such framework exists. This may be superseded as the DAO continues to grow. This proposal introduces two concepts: financial stewards and financial periods:\n\n**Financial stewards** (or simply *stewards*) are a group of five DAO members elected by the DAO to oversee its finances. Notably, stewards are delegated authority from the DAO to jointly manage its the discretionary budget, directing the existing 7/11 multisig to fund smaller expenses without need for separate Snapshot votes.\n\n**Financial periods** are three months long (quarterly); in each financial period the DAO holds a Snapshot vote to determine both the allocation of assets in its treasury and the discretionary budget allocated to the financial stewards.\n\nThe Snapshot vote for this proposal, and all Snapshot votes described in this document, will require a **quorum of 300 EVMs voted** in order to be considered. This particular proposal will be approved with a simple majority (>50%) voting in favor.\n\n### Trial Period\n\nThis proposal details an indefinitely recurring series of financial periods and stewardships. However, the first financial period will act as a trial of the larger system. If approved, **this proposal will automatically expire at the end of the first financial period**. In order to continue as described, it must be reapproved (possibly with modifications) once by a majority (>50%) in an additional basic for/against Snapshot vote concluding no later than 3 weeks before the end of the first financial period.\n\n \n![manenet_diagram_ss.png](ipfs://QmbggAArUh6wU96anj5Vm4yBoH69RGSoYopGd2cNRvd1WP)\n    \n\n## Financial Stewards\n\nIn total, the DAO will elect and maintain a group of five financial stewards. Stewards serve for a term covering two financial periods, but may apply and be elected for additional terms. Immediately following the approval of this proposal, elections will be held for all five seats, with one week to collect applications on Discord and one week for an approval vote on Snapshot. At the end of the first financial period, the stewards will agree on 2-3 members who will step down, with their seats opening for reelection for terms beginning with the second financial period. Thus, terms are staggered, with 2-3 seats requiring reelections each financial period (detailed below).\n\nThe responsibilities of the financial stewards are as follows:\n\n* Oversee the DAO’s finances, keeping up-to-date records on income, expenses, and treasury status, making this information accessible to DAO members;\n* Collectively direct the DAO’s discretionary budget, with authority delegated from the DAO to manage smaller expenses on its behalf (i.e. without a Snapshot vote);\n* Actively seek out potential funding opportunities that align with the DAO’s goals;\n* Provide official recommendations regarding the DAO’s finances to the broader ManeNet community; and\n* Organize the Snapshot votes for steward elections and treasury/budget allocations prior to each financial period.\n\nThe stewards do not have direct custody of DAO funds. Stewards are expected to identify funding opportunities within their budget, confer with the community and amongst themselves, and pass any funding decisions on to the multisig signers, who then execute the transactions. The stewards and multisig may negotiate on when and how transactions are executed. The multisig is expected to generally respect the wishes of the stewards (as they are acting on behalf of the DAO), but act as a check in case of a corrupt or compromised set of stewards.\n\nStewards’ funding decisions include, but are not limited to: donations, grants, bounties, and retroactive funding. This proposal places few requirements on how the stewards carry out their responsibilities. Funding decisions must pass through the multisig as described above. Additionally, discussion between stewards should primarily occur in spaces readable by general DAO members (e.g. permissioned Discord channels). Aside from these restrictions, stewards may organize as they see fit.\n\nIf the DAO finds that a steward is not fulfilling their responsibilities, any DAO member may submit a Snapshot vote calling for the removal of that steward. The vote will be conducted as a basic for/against vote, requiring a 2/3 majority in favor to pass. If the vote passes, the steward should be immediately removed from their position, and an election held to fill the vacancy should be held immediately (one week for nominations, one week for voting via approval vote). The replacement steward serves only for the remainder of the removed steward’s term.\n\n## Financial Periods\n\nFinancial periods are three months long, beginning on the 1st of January, April, July, and October. The first financial period may be an exception: after election of the first five financial stewards, the stewards are expected to collect proposals for one week and hold a one-week-long vote after that, with the first financial period beginning immediately after the vote. In case the date is not one of the usual period start dates, the stewards may decide whether or not to skip the following period start date.\n\nEach financial period, a Snapshot vote determines what should be done with the DAO’s treasury funds. The stewards are expected to produce a report on the DAO’s finances, along with their recommendations for how to proceed. They then solicit and aggregate *financial period proposals* from the community and create a ranked-choice Snapshot vote, with the winning proposal being adopted for its financial period. A financial period proposal consists of:\n\n* Asset allocation for the entire treasury, may allocate to illiquid options such as RP minipools;\n* A discretionary budget to be assigned to the financial stewards;\n* Flat monetary compensation to the stewards themselves; and\n* Any additional guidance for the stewards or multisig signers.\n\nAsset allocation and budget may be static (e.g. X ETH) or dynamic (e.g. rebalancing percentages, dependent on revenue, or conditional on future events). Snapshot votes may be submitted during a quarter to alter a previously-approved by a financial period proposal, and should be held as a basic for/against vote with a 2/3 majority in approval in order to pass. Stewards’ monetary compensation should be disbursed at the end of the period evenly between the stewards, and in the event a steward was replaced during the period, both the original and the replacement will be compensated pro rata.\n\nThe end of each financial period involves a series of steps to prepare for the following financial period:\n\n* Four weeks prior to the end of the period, stewards should begin collecting applications for the steward seats requiring reelection.\n* Three weeks out, stewards should initiate a week-long Snapshot approval-vote to elect replacement stewards.\n* Two weeks out, stewards should begin collecting financial period proposals from the community and creating their own.\n* One week out, stewards should initiate a week-long Snapshot ranked-choice vote to select the financial period proposal to put into effect.\n* On the date the new financial period begins, the multisig executes any actions indicated by the selected financial period proposal, and stewardship is passed from those whose terms are expiring to those who had been newly elected.\n",

These whitelist spots will guarantee you a free MoonHead mint (other than gas) once minting starts on the 17th.\n\nA few ManeNet members have taken a look at the deployed contract (https://etherscan.io/address/0x1542b05412dfecd80e734929f9087f8766934275#code) and think it looks pretty typical and reasonable for an NFT project, with no obvious (to us) nasty surprises. This is NOT an audit or guarantee of quality; as always, do your own research and participate at your own risk.\n\nBy 'voting' in this Snapshot (choose the single option and sign), you will receive however many slots in the raffle as you hold EVMs in the voting wallet.\n\nIf you aren't interested in participating in the raffle, simply don't 'vote'. Please also only 'vote' if you actually intend to claim your MoonHead(s) should you win the raffle.",

Having a mission statement will simply provide guidance for future decisions, and will make sure that the foundational goals of the DAO, as mandated by its members with this vote, are considered. \n\nIf \"ManeNet DAO\" is not selected in the DAO name vote, the actually selected name will be substituted. \n\nAt least *80%* of votes must approve the mission statement for the vote to pass. When voting, please select the single best option that applies. The full text of the mission statement is as follows:\n\n## Our mission as ManeNet DAO\n### *To advance the decentralized Ethereum Web3 ecosystem by aligning shared member incentives with funding, developing, and promoting public goods and education.*\n\n## Vision\nManeNet DAO envisions a world with a long-term, self-sufficient, and regenerative cryptoeconomic landscape. We see an ecosystem with a greater symbiotic effect between its protocols and users; one that enables sustainable and reliable public goods funding for projects that need it most. \n\n## Values\n*Public goods*\nManeNet DAO emerges from the culture of open-source software, the foundation of Web3. ManeNet DAO treasury allocates funding towards public goods that honor this ethos, through avenues such as Gitcoin. We want to set an example for future Web3 communities: contribute to the infrastructure that underpins this space while still providing value to your members.\n\n*Education*\nThe current technological landscape of Ethereum is a world of opportunities with increasingly complex innovation. ManeNet DAO will host and distribute knowledge so the community can remain on the cutting edge on this new and exciting frontier. The foundation of our community has always been education. We have a history of teaching each other, and we want to extend our tradition of discussion amongst intellectually honest peers to a wider audience.\n\n*Decentralization*\nWe value decentralization in all aspects: of the network and of power. ManeNet DAO actively supports a distributed Ethereum and works to amplify its resilience, as well as incentivize decentralization in existing and future projects. We believe that decentralization is a means to provide freedom, fairness, and open access to every person.",

      "content": "This is a vote to elect multisig members for the DAO. Multisig members will collectively control the EVMavericks contract, and any funds or other assets belonging to the DAO raised through royalties, mints, or other monetization approaches. \n\nPlease select (via approving) exactly 11 out of the following 26 applicants to serve on the 7-of-11 multisig. They should be people you feel would be outstanding, diverse representatives of the ideals of Ethereum, EthFinance, and EVMavericks, and who would execute transactions reliably and exclusively at the direction of the DAO. Additionally, please try to select as geographically diverse a set of people as possible, without selecting unsuitable applicants.\n\nThe elected multisig will be composed of the 11 applicants who received the most votes, with the exception that we will only select the *top 5* from any one geographical region.\n\nThe ranked list of candidates not selected will form the initial \"multisig replacement list\", from which replacements, if needed for any reason, will be drawn in order, except if they would break the \"no more than 5 from any one region\" rule.\n\nHere are the applicants, grouped by geographical region, and otherwise in the order that they submitted applications.\n\n\n= North America =\n\n@InsideTheSimulation#9285 \nu/InsideTheSimulation\n\nHello, I’ve been involved in the crypto space since late 2016 / early 2017 as an investor and learner. Most of my reputation with you all comes from having built RatioGang.com and pal’ing around with many of you in r/ethfinance over the years. I have a tech background and am excited to help ethfinance / EVMavericks grow into a shining example of what an altruistic DAO can be in the space.\n\n\n@jumnhy#6317\nu/jumnhy\n\nHi folks, I've been learning about crypto since 2011 or so back in college, but really took the plunge in 2017 as an investor. Ever since, I've been a regular (found my online fam, tbqh) in EthFinance, which became a jumping-off point for involvement with other crypto communities and moving into test dev work in my day job. Strong believer in advancing the social good, and signatory or not, I look forward to making this space the best it can be.\n\n\n@krism142#2774\nu/krism142\n\nHi all, I have been in the crypto space in one way or another since early 2013 when I got interested in learning how to mine bitcoin ( I know I know, it was a different time ok, get off my lawn ) which lead me to the early days of dogecoin and our fun altruistic projects we did there.  By day I am a software dev focusing on backend api development and a dad, by night I like to spend time split between shitposting and having fun technical discussion on ethfinance and in other crypto areas.  Looking forward to building an awesome dao that pushes eth in the direction of decentralization for all.\n\n\n@Zeus.eth#8114\nu/Zeus_eth\n\nHello Pride. I've been in crypto since I read the bitcoin white paper in March 2017 and went down the rabbit hole until I bought the first decentraland Ethereum NFTs in Dec 2017. I remained an active memeber of r/ethfinance throughout the bear, and got to try lots of defi primitives MKR, COMP, UNI, SNX as they were coming out. Eventually I became the first community manager for the singaporean NFT startup Mintable, and learned how to onboard users, disseminate ideas, and do a podcast type show on NFTs. My attention has now turned to the philosophy of Degrowth and how regnerative crypto economics may allow us to perpetually fund sustainable projects for a world in collapse.\n\n\n@austonst#2547\nu/austonst\n\nI've been in the crypto space since 2012, with long periods of lurking more than contributing, but always around to keep track of the cool innovations. Been more active this year; you may recognize me from my comprehensive ETHDenver summaries on ethfinance, or possibly from work on our r/place logo. I have a background in computer science, but while I'm unsure to what extent I'll contribute to the technical side of the DAO, I do have the free time and will to commit to multisig duties if people find me so suited for it.\n\n\n@illram#3412\nu/illram\n\nEthereum/ethfinance degen since Jan 2018. Lawyer IRL (not crypto related, but willing to provide free basic advice where I can, hopefully not of the catastrophically incorrect variety.) I will faithfully (1) execute the will of the DAO; (2) not rug; and (3) practice competent OPSEC over my keys. If I become unable to perform any of the above, I promise to promptly notify the DAO so I can be replaced.\n\n\n@LogrisTheBard#0557\nu/logristhebard\n\nI've been part of the ethfinance and ethtrader subreddits since 2017. I host the https://tokenomicsexplained.com/ website. I proposed the coming Protocol Runoff Poll and intend to be active using this DAO to further enrich the ethfinance community.\n\n\n@Pixelhigh#8369\nu/Whoopziedaisy\n\nlongtime enthusiast and investor in crypto since the glorious silk road days. generally offer foundational knowledge of the space and a commitment to a decentralized ethos. have been in the sub since the ethtrader split; would uphold its integrity at all times and faithfully execute the dao. have learned a lot from wonderful people. for a day job i work as an art production manager and graphic designer.\n\n\n@matt0x.eth (gm)#7865\nu/matt0x_eth\n\nI’ve been aware and interested in crypto since 2011, but dove down the rabbit hole and have been in the space since 2017 after watching countless Andreas Antonopoulos videos and resonating with the mission of decentralization of power. I found Ethereum in late 2017 and lurked EthTrader and EthFinance and appreciated the intelligent discourse, but only dove into DeFi and NFTs after DeFi summer. I am a scientist at a startup who runs the laboratory and fills my ears constantly with Bankless, Green Pill, Daily Gwei, The Defiant, UpOnly, PROOF, and Overpriced JPEGs\n\n\n@superphiz#1038\nu/superphiz\n\nhttps://www.gitpoap.io/p/superphiz.eth tells the most. I'm an Ethereum Crowdsale participant, original Ethereum Olympic Testnet Miner, Organizer for EthStaker, POAP lover, Rocket Pool fan, lover of communities that reach for wholesomeness, decentralization, and higher values. My intention is that Ethereum be allowed to actualize its potential to improve humanity for all. I don't typically get involved with NFT stuff, but this has my attention and I do what's fun. This is it right now. I want to be very open and clear that I do have intentions to buy/sell/trade thundercats and I don't believe in the \"diamond hands\" philosophy. People should be free to do as they wish with their assets.\n\n\n@DrLove#0295\nu/Bob-Rossi\n\nI have been in crypto since late 2015, Ethereum itself since early 2016 (Poloniex trollbox gang!) and have lurked or participated in r/Ethtrader & r/Ethfinance for about as long. Not a super technical person but love to read about and be involved in blockchain. I have been a contributor for a few projects - the ethmerge site, support EIP-1559 project, and recently the ethsunshine project . My only real DAO experience is losing some of my ETH to the DAO hack itself 🙂 but I've been really excited about the prospect of a r/Ethfinance DAO for a while now and was honored to be nominated.\n\n\n@harryzke#6129\nu/harryzke\n\nethfinance day 1, ethtrader since 2017, I’m passionate about the ethfinance sub and long thought organizing together in a dao would be amazing. I’d help execute the daos will and do my best to honour the ethics of the sub and Ethereum in supporting public goods\n\n\n@nixorokish#9967\nReddit username: u/nixorokish, u/stripedgreywallpaper, u/stripedredwallpaper, u/stripedbluewallpaper\n\nEnvironmental scientist by trade, but been being an idiot in crypto since 2013 or so, ETH since late 2016 (Poloniex troll box gang too!). Open source/decentralization/diversity maxi and r/ethstaker mod.\n\nMain relevant qualifiers here: I'm level-headed, I take my time to make decisions, I treat people with kindness, seek compromises and community support, and I'm extremely good with my security practices.\n\n\n@LuketheDuke#4621\nu/thepaypay\n\nEther bull/fanatic since 2017 with all activity and participation verified on reddit and on-chain. Check activity via thepaypay.eth / OG crypto kitties, gods unchained power user, and vlCVX holder able to point crv emissions in mass and record of faithful governance participation. I am forever a ETH bull first and foremost and i see EVM's as a avenue to contribute to the ecosystem i call home.\n\n\n@pegcity#0439\nu/pegcity\n\nGot into ethereum directly in June 2017, my job involves managing budgets of $350M to $1.8B including signing authorities for contracts. I am experienced in using smart contracts and crypto in general, have never been the victim of any sort of fishing attack and take security very seriously with over 100 unique passwords that are formula driven based on usecase. Hold a Canadian CPA (essentially a masters degree in accounting and financial analysis, much harder to pass than the US equivalent).\n\n\n@The-A-Word#5973\nu/the-A-word\n\nI got into Ethereum in 2016, been hodl since 2016 and havent looked back ever since. I can provide an alternative POV to the community coming from a no tech background and minimal tech lifestyle. The discovery of eth has ignited a curiosity to learn and adapt, I run a rocket pool node with allnode and currently learning to run a solo staking node unassisted..I allign with the ethos of ethfinance and put respect, gratitude and willingness to learn and explore above all else. I understand the significance of what is being built here and strive to make a contribution in anyway.\n\n\n@protoplanetary#6428\nu/interweaver\n\nI first started looking into crypto in 2017, and immediately gravitated towards the Ethereum ecosystem, due to its decentralization, revolutionary smart contracts and open-source, world-improving ethos. I lurked EthTrader, eventually joined EthFinance after the split because of how well those core Ethereum values are represented by its members, and am professionally working in web3 as a P2E/Open Economy game designer and developer. I am not really actively seeking to be elected to the DAO multisig, because there are phenomenal other applicants and I don't have a ton of free time, but if the DAO really wants me, I would be honored to serve, and would use the role solely to execute the DAO's will when it needs the multisig to do so, and at absolutely no other time.\n\n\n@Plumbus#6214\ntop secret\n\nLarge EVM holder and defi super user. I am also an engineer (but I don't work in crypto, yet).\n\n\n= Oceania =\n\n@Ray Zhu#8821\nu/rayzhueth\n\nEthfinance and ethtrader have been my home for Ethereum ever since I discovered it in 2017. I have learnt so much from the community and I want to help give back. I am strongly committed to the principles of decentralisation and will not compromise on them in favour of an 'easier' way. I have a strong background in the NFT space (am currently working at Immutable) and have experience participating in many other DAOs.\n\n\n= Europe =\n\n@Jerome de Tychey | Cometh#5613\nu/Jey_s_Tears\n\nIn crypto since 2013, current president of Ethereum-France, hosting EthCC each year, I run a blockchain videogame company, I have multisignature duties on various protocols (notably Polygon). Previously: B2B exec director at ConsenSys and global head of customer success at Ledger.\n\n\n@Bram#4915\nu/BramBramEth\n\nHigh level engineering director / Cryptographer in a big finance company, I'm an evangelist for all things blockchain there.\nBTC since 2011 - got into ETH a bit late though. Lurker in ethtrader, then a bit more active after the ethfinance split.\nMainly applying to ensure balanced EU presence in the multi sig - I'd be proud to hold this responsibility, since the ethos of the project really resonate with me.\n\n\n\n@heyheeyheeey#0428\nu/heyheeyheeey\n\nAvid r/ethtrader lurker from the early days and permabull participant in r/ethfinance (some might remember me from the \"ETH to 10K\" daily reminders). I'm a designer, worked in the past at one of the OG NFT-focused companies, have also played around with creating some generative art NFTs and am a multi-sig signer for Solos.\n\nI vow to uphold and represent the values of decentralisation, progress, friendliness and camaraderie that Ethereum, r/ethfinance and EVM embody to the best of my abilities.\n\n\n@vetinary.the.patrician#4407\nu/alexiskef\n\nI've been following the Ethereum development/ ecosystem since early 2017. I have been a member of ethtrader and then  ethfinance since then, trying to learn & contribute in any way that I can (hence this application). In my opinion, the most important aspect of our community is the respect we try to extend to each other on a \"Daily\" basis. THAT is why I truly see everyone here/there, as a friend and not as an internet stranger! Professionally, I have a corporate financial background (10+ years), yet the past 5 (Ethereum) years of my life are the ones I am most proud of!\n\n\n@Saitham86#3301\nu/Saitham86\n\nLaw & Finance. Been in finance since 2011 working for the Dark Side in the public and private sector: a stint at an Econ ministry, then a national bank and finally the ECB. Also worked for 2 banks and for 1 of the big 4 consulting firms. After  becoming disillusioned with the unending printing of money, I delved into crypto in 2014 and never left. In 2020 I finally fled the Dark Side and I now work full time in crypto. Experienced with multisigs and both IRL and Smart Contracts. It's an honour to even be considered in such esteemed company.\n\n\n= Asia =\n\n@CosmicCollusion#9676\nu/CosmicCollusion\n\nIn crypto since 2017, religiously read (and post in) the dailies and try to keep up-to-date with the comings and goings in crypto. I'm interested in becoming a multi-sig signer as I've been looking to take on a more active role in the community now that I have excess free time, and the proposed direction/ethos/goals of EVMs seems like a perfect fit for what I'm looking for.\n\n\n= South America =\n\n@Bergmannskase#7889\nu/Bergmannskase\n\nI've been reading about crypto on and off since 2014 and mostly lurking ethtrader/ethfinance. I finally took the plunge in 2021 once I was comfortable and I haven't missed a daily since then.\n\nI have a background in finance and I'm answering the roar to arms regarding geographic diversity. I hope to become a more active contributor to our community, even if I don't become a multisigner, and help us slay Moloch.\n\n",

      "content": "This is a vote to determine whether to mint the remaining EVMs to the DAO multisig.\n\nBackground information:\n\n1. After the public raffle minting has closed on the evening of April 28th, there will be some number, likely ~50, of unminted EVMs.\n2. Leaving them unminted is an option, but they would need to be minted in the future if we ever wanted to do something with them.\n3. Minting them to anybody but the DAO in the future would practically require the cooperation of the Autominter team, because they essentially have centralized control over the whitelist.\n4. Marketplaces like OpenSea require collections to be fully minted in order to be verified.\n5. If we do mint them ourselves, it would likely cost around 0.5 Eth in gas, which would come out of the DAO treasury.\n6. If we do mint them ourselves, we would want to do so before transferring power to our elected 7 of 11 multisig, which will happen on April 30th or shortly thereafter, to reduce the amount of work it would take.\n7. If we do mint them ourselves, future votes would be required to decide what to do with them from there.\n\nPlease select how you would like to proceed. The multisig will execute the option with the most votes when this vote has ended.\n\n",
