      "content": "```\nCIP: 51\ntitle: Wintermute <> COW Liquidity Provision Partnership\nauthor: Wintermute\nstatus: Active\ncreated: 2024-08-09\n```\n\n## Simple Summary\n\nWintermute is requesting a loan of 7.5M COW tokens from the DAO’s treasury for liquidity provision purposes across various decentralised and centralised exchanges. The 7.5M COW tokens will be transferred from the DAO to a grantee’s wallet before being subsequently transferred to Wintermute wallet.\n\n## Motivation\n\nThe CoW DAO has recently been exploring efforts to increase COW’s onchain liquidity ([CIP-37](https://forum.cow.fi/t/cip-37-increasing-liquidity-for-cow-token-via-a-programmatic-order-and-an-fm-amm/2203)) through its novel FM-AMM mechanism. We’d like to complement these efforts by doing what we do best and provide liquidity for COW across major centralised and decentralised exchanges (including our 1800+ OTC clients).\n\nCurrently, the only way to acquire COW is through decentralised channels with the largest pool being Balancer’s ETH/COW on Ethereum Mainnet. With only decentralised venues available, a lot of users and institutions are unable to access COW.\n\nWith our partnership, we aim to make COW more accessible to gas-sensitive users, institutions, whales, and potential investors who are deterred by the lack of liquidity and subsequent price volatility.\n\nLastly, this partnership would further develop our relationship and alignment with CoW DAO. Wintermute (Rizzolver) has recently integrated as a Solver on CoW Swap where we plan to offer COW liquidity:\n\n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreifejzsk7a65gn7yqpvlk6lk5qssdkwstyjmtvel7wqropqib2uhke)\nSource: Dune (@cowprotocol), Dated: June 10, 2024.\n\n**Wintermute’s Basic Background:**\n\nWintermute Trading is a leading crypto-native algorithmic trading firm, specialising in creating efficient markets across centralised and decentralised exchanges. Wintermute was founded in July 2017 by three Optiver veterans. Evgeny Gaevoy, founder and CEO, was previously head of ETFs (screen and OTC) at Optiver Europe, one of the largest ETF market-making desks. Since our inception, we have traded over $4.9T USD in volume and expanded our presence across 80+ (de)centralised exchanges and various (non)EVM chains, continuously supporting the ecosystem for our partners and their communities.\n\nAlongside our trading arm, Wintermute Ventures and Wintermute Governance support and work with leading crypto projects with the goal of truly adding value, enabling partnerships, and helping shape a positive outcome for the ecosystem. Importantly, we do not target large ownership stakes; decentralised ownership is an important prerequisite to transitioning to a robust future.\n\n## Specification\n\n**Our Ask:**\n\nWintermute is requesting a loan of 7.5M COW for 1 year from the CoW DAO Treasury for liquidity provision purposes.\n\n**Wintermute’s COW Loan Plans:**\n\n* Proactively guide discussions and support listings of COW on key exchanges on day one and going forward.\n* Provide liquid markets across major centralised exchanges (once listed).\n* Provide liquidity across DeFi aggregators such as CoW Swap, UniswapX, 1inch, Bebop, Airswap, and Hashflow.\n* Be the go-to liquidity provider for any OTC & Institutional flow, providing competitive prices for tickets $100k+.\n* Borrowed COW will be used exclusively for liquidity provision purposes. No farming, lending, governance, etc.\n\n**Loan Return:**\n\nWintermute Trading will return the full 7.5M COW loan amount at the end of the 1-year loan term OR exercise the repayment option below.\n\n**Ecosystem Grant and Ownership:**\n\nFor the purpose of this proposal, CoW DAO shall allocate the requested amount of COW token to a designated service company (the \"Grantee\") as an irrevocable and unconditional grant. Subsequently, the Grantee shall provide the requested loan to Wintermute Trading under the terms of this CIP.\n\nThe allocation of COW tokens to the Grantee is non-repayable and any financial gains resulting from the Grantee's collaboration with Wintermute Trading or repayment of the loan shall be allocated towards CoW ecosystem marketing and development as determined by the respective teams.\n\n***Note: the starting date of the arrangement will begin on the first day (UTC Time) COW is listed on a reputable centralised exchange. The arrangement will then end 1 year from this date.***\n\n**Repayment Option:**\n\nThe repayment option allows Wintermute Trading to purchase COW from the loan amount on the respective loan expiry date at the strike prices specified below.\n\nLoan Strike Prices:\n\n* 3.75M COW @ $0.40 ($400M FDV)\n* 3.75M COW @ P + 50%\n\n**P = VWAP (Volume Weighted Average Price) of COW over the first 7 days of trading. The price of COW will be sourced from an unbiased third-party website.*\n\nShould Wintermute Trading choose to exercise our repayment option, the value of the loan at the strike price will be returned to the Grantee in the form of USDT or USDC assuming a USDC/USDT price of $1.\n\n## Transaction\n\nTransfer 7.5M COW from CoW DAO (0xcA771eda0c70aA7d053aB1B25004559B918FE662) to\n\nthe Grantee’s wallet (0x63b7734Ce21c2e2a19ef4cD3C301c64F8faBd336) to\n\nWintermute Trading (0xdCa72c1558ae5B8787744F8025d8b2eF7E87cCdb)",

      "title": "CIP-50: Establishing a Legal Defense Reserve",
      "content": "```\nCIP 50\ntitle: Establishing a Legal Defense Reserve.\nauthor: Kowrigan\nstatus: active\n```\n\n# **Simple Summary**\nThis CIP proposes establishing a Legal Defense Reserve that will accrue value up to 5 million USD in stablecoins. The reserve will function as a self-insurance to fund the defense or prosecution of legal processes and proceedings of CoW DAO and its contributors directly related to activities of CoW DAO.\n\n# **Motivation**\nSelf-insurance is a widely recognized risk management technique where funds are set aside to cover potential future expenses, acting as a tool for retaining and managing risks. It is especially useful for novel or complex risks that traditional insurance cannot cover or as a complement to existing insurance.\n\nSince DAOs like CoW DAO are new organizational structures, CoW DAO and its contributors may face novel legal risks. Establishing this Legal Defense Reserve will help protect CoW DAO and its contributors.\n\n# **Specification**\n## I - Legal Defense Framework\n### 1. Scope and Eligibility\nThe Legal Defense Reserve is designed to cover legal defense expenses incurred by COW DAO and its contributors in cases of legal or regulatory actions directly related to their activities within the DAO.\n\nFor the purposes of this reserve, a ‘contributor’ refers to any individual or entity that directly or indirectly contributes to the operations, governance, objectives, or ecosystem of the CoW DAO. This includes, but is not limited to:\n\n**Direct Contributors**: Those directly involved in the DAO’s operations, governance, and decision-making processes, such as token holders actively participating in governance by submitting proposal and engaging on a frequent basis in discussion related to DAO’s operations and activities, developers and service providers working on the DAO’s codebase and/or directly supporting CoW DAO’s operations.\n**Indirect Contributors**: Individuals or entities that contribute to or support the DAO’s objectives and ecosystem without directly participating in its operations or governance through Direct Contributors service providers.\nFunds from the Legal Defense Reserve will be allocated, where appropriate, specifically for legal defense, prosecution and representation purposes of CoW DAO and its contributors.\n\n### 2. Claim Process\n#### a. Claim by Contributors\nContributors will cover their own legal expenses initially and, if eligible, can submit a claim to the Legal Defense Reserve for reimbursement.\n\nClaims must include supporting documentation and will be submitted to the Committee. All claims will be reviewed and verified by the Committee.\n\n**i**. The Committee will assess eligibility, evaluate supportive documentation, and issue a reasoned decision within ten (10) working days.\n**ii**. In the event the claim is approved the Committee will execute payouts or request additional information if needed.\n\nBy way of exception, if the estimated initial costs or payment on account for the legal defense of the contributor exceed USD 10,000, the Committee may, based on a written fee estimate from a law firm in good standing with a recognized reputation for expertise in the required field, and with all supporting documentation, agree to initially cover such costs.\n#### b. Claim by CoW DAO\nIn the event that CoW DAO, as a collective entity, faces legal challenges or regulatory actions directly related to its operations, governance, or ecosystem, the Legal Defense Reserve Committee may allocate funds for the DAO’s defense.\n\nThe Committee will assess the nature and scope of the legal challenge affecting CoW DAO. If deemed necessary for the protection of the DAO’s interests, operations, or members as a whole, the Committee may approve the allocation of funds from the Legal Defense Reserve.\n\nSuch allocations will follow a process similar to that outlined for individual contributor claims, including:\n**i.** Submission of supporting documentation detailing the legal challenge and proposed defense strategy.\n**ii.** Review and verification by the Committee within ten (10) working days.\n**iii.** Approval of fund allocation based on a reasoned decision by the Committee.\n\nFunds allocated for DAO defense will be managed by the Committee and disbursed directly to approved legal representatives or service providers.\n\nThe Committee will provide regular updates to DAO members on the use of funds for collective defense, ensuring transparency while maintaining necessary legal confidentiality.\n\n### 3. Legal Defense Reserve Committee\nThe Defense Reserve Committee (the “Committee”) will consist of CoW DAO multisig signers, as well as the risks and the legal functions signers.\n\nThis Committee will be structured as a Safe multisig wallet (eth:0xe5f86CfaB4C03D013f8b2A1333962A36f777E214) that requires approval from at least 3 out of the 7 (3/7) of the signers for any transaction.\n\nThe Members of CoW DAO multisig are:\n\n* eth:0x04ce1ccF81AE660e23ca0c0823911df709B0E7Fc\n* eth:0x0a2aaA50135dA1628c8D29216f25Bf2a28efb219\n* eth:0x54b8B7DDF8453De6D53a59E91877a5aD1A01B5b8\n* eth:0x5Efd3E2E18696A44A4cB3F3eA5F637C3F3CcCf0f\n* eth:0xf10Fe968d1856131FC6835ed7d7126eaF8b5a6b6\n\nThe Risk function is:\n\n* eth:0x5Be85A2463751E0eEd583a2cb7de2A3A0E7a7405\n\nThe Legal function is:\n\n* eth:0xf8cD023cbe68544C3dF7AD1620be69EA2C0d4BC4\n## II - Reserve Establishment and Management\n### 1. The Reserve\nThe Legal Defense Reserve shall be a Safe multisig wallet that requires approval from at least one-third (1/3) of the signers for any transaction.\n\nThe signers controlling this multisig will be the Legal Defense Reserve Committee Safe, the CoW DAO Treasury Safe, and the CoW DAO Safe.\n\n#### Accruing Funds\nThe Legal Defense Reserve will accrue value through periodic contributions from CoW DAO’s treasury or other revenue sources until it reaches a total of 5 million USD.\n\nContributions will be based on 20% of accumulated revenue from all CoW DAO products, which should be streamed to the Defense Reserve as they are received. Contributions will occur weekly or monthly.\n\nCoW DAO reserves the right to add any amount to the reserve at any time to meet the targeted amount.\n\nOnce the total amount of 5 million USD is reached, periodic contributions will cease.\n\nIf a claim is approved and a payment is made from the reserve, periodic contributions will resume until the reserve again reaches the total amount of 5 million USD.\n\n#### Fund Management\nThe Treasury is authorised to passively invest assets up to 90% of the Reserve in yield farming protocols, being acceptable the usage of other treasury safes for pursuing said activities.\n\n# Rational\n**From the Perspective of the DAO:**\n* Legal Protection: Shielding against lawsuits and ensuring regulatory compliance.\n* Operational Continuity: Ensuring uninterrupted operations during legal challenges.\n* Member Assurance: Building trust and mitigating perceived risks among contributors.\n* Asset Protection: Safeguarding the DAO’s treasury from being depleted by legal costs.\n\n**From the Perspective of Contributors:** \n* Personal Liability Protection: Reducing individual liability concerns and boosting confidence in participation.\n* Community Stability: Providing collective assurance and promoting a secure, stable environment.\n\n**Overall Strategic Benefits:**\n* Attracting High-Quality Contributors: Drawing in skilled and experienced participants.\n* Competitive Advantage: Enhancing the DAO’s reputation and reliability.\n* Resilience and Adaptability: Preparing the DAO to handle changes despite regulatory uncertainty.\n# Execution\n* Mandate the Core Team and Treasury team to redirect 20% of CoW DAO revenue to the build up of the Defense Reserve at eth:0x7F8987D6A8bee31bD7bE80E877732579E2582a28.\n* Mandate the Treasury team to passively invest assets up to 90% of the Reserve in yield farming protocols, being acceptable the usage of other treasury safes for pursuing said activities.\n* Mandate the Committee as decision makers for this Reserve until liquidation.",

      "title": "CIP-49: Extending the Revenue Model Testing Period for CoW Protocol",
      "content": "```\nCIP: 49\nTitle: Extending the Revenue Model Testing Period for CoW Protocol\nAuthor: Alex Marsh\nStatus: active\nCreated: 2024-07-16\n```\n## Summary\nThis CIP proposes that CoW DAO extend its revenue model testing period for CoW Protocol, as initially proposed with [CIP-34](https://snapshot.org/#/cow.eth/proposal/0xe358941aa3f3aeaf94d40e6904c9bb530c98f88e363c2f309d9898b0ffb16c1f), by an additional 6 months.\n\n## Motivation\nCIP-34 directed CoW DAO’s core team to spend 6 months testing promising fee models for the purpose of generating revenue from CoW Protocol. In the ensuing period, the core team tested the following fee models:\n\n- Surplus fees on out-of-market limit orders\n- Quote improvement fees on market orders\n- Volume fees on Gnosis Chain orders (excluding stable-to-stable pairs)\n\nThe results are, as follows:\n\n- Surplus fees on out-of-market limit orders have generated 273 ETH from CoW Protocol. During the observation period, from Jan 23rd to March 26th, limit order usage actually increased while retention stayed flat. As a reminder, this fee type aligns protocol incentives with user incentives; no other exchange is able to generate surplus on out-of-market limit orders. [(Reference)](https://x.com/CoWSwap/status/1773163707331461620)\n- Quote improvement fees on market orders have generated 467 ETH from CoW Protocol. During the observation period, from April 3rd to June 7th, CoW Protocol market share dipped slightly before rebounding (it is now above the mean for 2024), and churn dropped from 10% to 6%. This is another value-aligned fee model. [(Reference)](https://x.com/CoWSwap/status/1799172409351967126)\n- Volume fees on Gnosis Chain have so-far generated ~$5.2k in revenue from CoW Protocol. During the observation period, which is still ongoing, there have been small increases in user retention and product loyalty (a metric that tracks CoW Protocol users trading on competing platforms). The protocol is less than 4 weeks into this testing period, so we should continue to keep an eye on the numbers, especially as the volumes are quite low thus-far\n\n*NB: Up-to-date revenue information can always be found on the following Dune dashboard: [https://dune.com/cowprotocol/cow-revenue](https://dune.com/cowprotocol/cow-revenue)*\n\nIn sum, the tested fee models have generated a total of ~745 ETH for CoW DAO, to date. During the testing period, the core team has observed no statistically-significant impact on user behavior resulting from the fee model tests.\n\nThe core team believes that it would be beneficial to observe the impact of the fee model tests – especially the volume fee on Gnosis Chain – over a longer period of time. It also believes that there are additional fee models worth testing.\n\nAs the initial testing period expires on July 16, 2024, we propose to extend the time period of CIP-34 by another 6 months.\n\n## Specification\nIf this proposal passes, CIP-34 will stay in place, as written, for an additional period of 6 months from the date this proposal passes.\n\n## Rationale\nExtending the testing period will allow the core team to observe the impact of the initial fee tests over a longer period of time. It will also give them the chance to test more-ambitious fee models for the protocol.\n\nAdditional revenue can be used for multiple purposes: to accelerate the development of CoW Protocol, to acquire new users, to fund token utility, and more.\n\n## Execution\nIf this CIP passes, the core team will continue testing fee models under the guidelines set forth in CIP-34, for another 6 months. Fees will accrue to the same Safe that was created for revenue model testing under CIP-34. That Safe currently belongs to CoW DAO and is operated by the treasury team with a threshold of 1/2.",

      "content": "```\nCIP:  38\ntitle: Solver rewards budget renewal and update of CoW DAO bonding pool operations\nauthor: Haris Angelidakis, Andrea Canidio, Felix Henneke\nstatus: active\ncreated:  2024-07-10\n```\n## Simple Summary \nThe previous solver rewards budget (for the solver competition on mainnet) was defined and approved in CIP-36, about 5 months ago, committing 8M COW tokens for the solver competition, projected to last until the payout of July 30, 2024. The estimate proved to be slightly optimistic, with the allocated tokens depleted after the payout of July 16, 2024, instead of the original estimate of July 30, 2024.\n\nThis CIP proposes adjusting the rewards for the solver competition on mainnet, namely removing the consistency rewards. It also proposes that the program be fully funded (whenever possible) by allocating (part of) the COW tokens the DAO has repurchased with revenue earned from its products.\n\nMoreover, changes specific to the CoW DAO bonding pool operations are proposed in order to further encourage decentralization, as well as mitigate the risks associated with the CoW DAO bonding pool. Specifically, a service fee is proposed to be paid by solvers that have been in the CoW DAO pool for a sufficiently long time. The revenue from this service fee will stay in the Solver Payouts Safe and will be redirected to further align the solvers’ evolution with CoW DAO’s goals and vision.\n\n## Motivation\nAt the time of writing, there are 24 solvers competing to provide the best possible execution for CoW Protocol users on mainnet. This dense network of solvers has proved to be very reliable and competent, providing very robust quotes, doing private market making, striving to improve their view of the available onchain liquidity, and taking advantage of the structural benefits of batching. All these are largely due to the solver rewards that solvers receive in COW.\n\nPart of these rewards are currently disbursed as consistency rewards to solvers who do not win batches but submit valid solutions. Consistency rewards were initially introduced to incentivize participation in the solver competition, which does not seem necessary anymore. Also, given the way they are calculated, they commit the protocol to spending at least a given amount of COW per week. Finally, for the past several months, consistency rewards were minimal or zero, which did not seem to affect the competition. It is therefore proposed that these rewards be eliminated.\n\nMoreover, with CIP-34, the protocol has proved that it can generate significant revenue, while still providing very competitive prices to users. Because of that, and as a first very important step towards a more sustainable and long-term plan for the rewards mechanism, this CIP proposes that the protocol revenue, either accrued in COW or post-buyback of COW (as specified in CIP-36), will be used to provide the necessary COW for solver rewards, among other important initiatives as determined by the DAO, and in the case where the amount of COW accumulated by the Treasury that is generated from protocol revenue is depleted, then a new proposal should be put together to ask the DAO for additional COW tokens. This CIP reserves the possibility for solver rewards to also be funded from other sources in the future, to ensure a robust and adaptable system.\n\nIn addition to the changes in the solver rewards program, it is also proposed that certain changes regarding the operations of the CoW DAO bonding pool are enacted. The CoW DAO bonding pool, with the processes around it, has allowed multiple solver teams to continue participating in the competition, thus leading to today’s state of the art solver competition that the protocol is running.\n\nHowever, the minimal requirements associated with joining the CoW DAO bonding pool and the very reasonable limitations solvers face when being part of the pool has also led to the unfortunate situation that a significant portion of the solvers are now part of the CoW DAO pool, and do not have any meaningful incentives to leave the pool and create their own bonding pool. This has important downsides, such as:\n\n1. All these solvers heavily rely on the default open-source so-called “driver” implementation operated by CoW DAO, that needs to be continuously maintained and updated by the core team, thus creating a centralized point of failure for multiple solvers (besides the constant pressure on the core team to continue the development of the default driver).\n\n2. Having multiple solvers in the same pool means that misbehavior of a solver could potentially (and in cases of significant losses of funds) lead to the closing of the pool itself, thus also immediately removing several solvers from the competition.\n\n3. Fully relying on the core team to provide robust implementations of the driver in any blockchain the DAO decides to expand to means that such expansion is much slower than it could have been possible.\n\nFor all these reasons this CIP proposes that the CoW DAO bonding pool sets additional rules that would still allow it to serve its original purpose, i.e., to facilitate the easy onboarding of solvers in the competition, while also ensuring that the pool itself does not create a decentralization barrier.\n\nSpecifically, the proposal is that all solvers that have been in the CoW DAO bonding pool for more than 6 months start paying a service fee, in the form of withholding 15% of the weekly COW rewards solvers are receiving. The COW collected from this service fee will remain in the Solver Payouts Safe and can be used for various reasons, such as bounty-type programs within the Solver Competition to encourage adoption of new features (e.g., support for partially fillable limit orders, integration of certain liquidity sources, CoW AMM support etc) and to further align the solvers’ evolution with CoW DAO’s goals and vision. We highlight that the service fee will also apply to solvers that create a reduced bonding pool, as specified in CIP-44, and we propose that the service fee is waived for the first 3 months of a solver operating within a reduced bonding pool; the rationale being that the reduced bonding pool should be seen as an intermediate step that will eventually lead to a solver either creating or joining a full-sized bonding pool.\n\n## Specification\n\nRemove consistency rewards, starting with the accounting week of Tuesday, July 23rd - Tuesday, July 30.\n\nTransfer 4M COW from the CoW DAO Treasury Safe (0x616dE58c011F8736fa20c7Ae5352F7f6FB9F0669) to the Solver Rewards Safe (0xA03be496e67Ec29bC62F01a428683D7F9c204930) on Wednesday July 24, 2024, and moving forward, provide a mandate to the Treasury Core Team to fund the Solver Rewards Safe with COW from Treasury allocation, whenever needed. In case it happens that there is not enough COW to cover the needs of the solver rewards program, a new CIP should be put in place to ask the DAO for additional COW.\n\nRegarding the service fee for solvers within the CoW DAO bonding pool, the starting date will be Tuesday, August 20, 2024, 00:00 (UTC), meaning that the first service fee will be paid on Tuesday, August 27, 2024. Specifically, the evaluation of whether a solver has been in the CoW DAO bonding pool for more than 6 months will happen on the first day of each accounting period, and this will determine whether a service fee should be paid by each solver for each accounting period.",

      "content": "```\nCIP: 47\nTitle: Funding for the purpose of facilitating the listing COW token on CEXs\nAuthor: @middleway.eth @notsoformal\nStatus: Active\nCreated: 2024-06-19\n```\n## Simple Summary\n\nThis proposal seeks to allocate 1 million USD equivalent in COW tokens and stablecoins for the purpose of facilitating potential listings on centralized exchanges (CEXs). The allocation will be used to cover listing fees and marketing allocations required by these exchanges.\n\n## Motivation\n\nListing COW tokens on major CEXs is a significant step towards enhancing liquidity, visibility, and accessibility of the COW token and the CoW ecosystem. While we cannot guarantee listings, having this budget allocated will support ongoing and future negotiations with interested exchanges.\n\n## Specification\n\nThis proposal requests the allocation of 1 million USD equivalent in COW tokens and stablecoins from the CoW DAO treasury to be earmarked for CEX listing fees and listing-related marketing activities. These tokens will be managed, in a dedicated subsafe, by the CoW DAO treasury team and disbursed as needed to facilitate the listing of the COW token on centralized exchanges.\n\nThe exact amount of COW tokens and stablecoins can be decided by the treasury team, but cannot exceed $1m USD equivalent in total, and cannot exceed 200k USD in stablecoins.\n\nAdditionally, the treasury mandate shall permit the use of any intermediaries or payment services that may be required for the CEX listing processes.\n\nThe key points of the specification are:\n\n* Total Allocation: 1 million USD equivalent in COW tokens and stablecoins (up to 4 million COW tokens and 200k USD in stablecoins)\n* Purpose: CEX listing fees and marketing allocations\n* Management: CoW DAO treasury team\n* Disbursement: As required by the listing agreements with CEXs\n* Termination: Any funds that were not used for the purpose of listing by 2025-06-31 should be returned to the CoW DAO Safe.\n\n## Rationale\n\nCentralized exchanges often require a token allocation as part of the listing process, as a listing fee, and / or marketing fee and marketing allocation to promote the token to users on their platforms. Allocating these tokens in advance will streamline the negotiation and listing process, making it easier for CoW DAO to secure listings on major centralized exchanges. This approach aligns with CoW DAO's values of promoting liquidity, user accessibility, and the growth of the COW ecosystem.\n\nAlternate designs, such as negotiating without a pre-allocated budget, were considered but deemed less effective due to the competitive nature and time sensitivity of exchange listings and the benefits of being prepared with a dedicated allocation.\n\n## Execution\n\n* Transfer of 4m COW tokens from CoW DAO to the Treasury team Safe\n\n* Allocation of 200k USDC from the treasury assets by the treasury team\n\nSafe Transaction Data\n```\n{\n  \"version\": \"1.0\",\n  \"chainId\": \"1\",\n  \"createdAt\": 1719980859723,\n  \"meta\": {\n    \"name\": \"Transactions Batch\",\n    \"description\": \"\",\n    \"txBuilderVersion\": \"1.16.5\",\n    \"createdFromSafeAddress\": \"0xcA771eda0c70aA7d053aB1B25004559B918FE662\",\n    \"createdFromOwnerAddress\": \"\",\n    \"checksum\": \"0x0767b3f8728cbf6f2ad47316f9d5b458da7c5c6ef97987b11fa4474292565614\"\n  },\n  \"transactions\": [\n    {\n      \"to\": \"0xDEf1CA1fb7FBcDC777520aa7f396b4E015F497aB\",\n      \"value\": \"0\",\n      \"data\": null,\n      \"contractMethod\": {\n        \"inputs\": [\n          {\n            \"internalType\": \"address\",\n            \"name\": \"recipient\",\n            \"type\": \"address\"\n          },\n          {\n            \"internalType\": \"uint256\",\n            \"name\": \"amount\",\n            \"type\": \"uint256\"\n          }\n        ],\n        \"name\": \"transfer\",\n        \"payable\": false\n      },\n      \"contractInputsValues\": {\n        \"recipient\": \"0x616dE58c011F8736fa20c7Ae5352F7f6FB9F0669\",\n        \"amount\": \"4000000000000000000000000\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n### Tenderly Simulation\n\n[[Link to Tenderly simulation]](https://dashboard.tenderly.co/public/safe/safe-apps/simulator/0d4c0205-8a24-440c-be42-7464b2504545)",

      "content": "```\nCIP: 46\ntitle: Funding for Marketing & Business Development Services - Service Agreement No 1\nauthor: @chim9\nstatus: Active\ncreated: 2024-06-21\n```\n\nSimple Summary\nThis CIP proposes allocating funds to secure comprehensive business development and marketing services for CoW DAO, delivered by Defou S.A. an external Service Provider (the “Service Provider”). The Service Provider will be responsible for market analysis, brand positioning, campaign creation and execution, and developing an ecosystem of partnerships. This will boost CoW DAO’s brands and products visibility, customer engagement, and long-term growth in the decentralized finance ecosystem.\n\nMotivation\nTo achieve the vision of a decentralized future where digital assets are traded fairly, efficiently, and reliably, CoW DAO requires a strategic approach to business development and marketing. By partnering with an expert Service Provider, this CIP ensures that CoW DAO will leverage tailored strategies aligned with the DAO’s values to expand brand awareness, strengthen partnerships, and engage new markets. The Service Provider will coordinate and facilitate the efforts of the various contributors contributing to the scope of service as defined below. This CIP is critical to ensuring that CoW DAO remains a competitive and innovative leader within the decentralized exchange space, aligned with the DAO’s long-term vision and values.\n\nScope of Services\nThe Service Provider agrees to deliver comprehensive business development and marketing services (the “Service”) to CoW DAO, including but not limited to:\n\nConducting market analysis to identify target audiences, explore new opportunities, and assess emerging trends.\nDeveloping brand positioning strategies to ensure alignment with CoW DAO’s core values and market objectives, enhancing brand perception.\nCreating and executing multi-channel marketing campaigns to increase visibility and attract high-quality partnerships related to CoW DAO and its products including but not limited to CoW Swap, CoW Swap Widget, CoW AMM, MEV Blocker, and COW Token.\nImplementing lead generation and customer engagement strategies, as well as fostering and executing partnerships on behalf of CoW DAO to support sustainable development and growth of the CoW ecosystem and COW token.\nProviding progress reports and data-driven insights to ensure transparency, track performance, and align strategies with CoW DAO’s evolving goals.\nDistributing CoW DAO’s products, managing revenue sharing and fee programs between CoW DAO and potential partners in relation to such products.\nCollaboration\nThe Service Provider will work closely and cooperate with CoW DAO and CoW DAO’s contributors to understand and coordinate business & marketing objectives, maintain alignment with the community’s goals, and adapt strategies accordingly.\n\nReporting and Timeline\nThe Service Provider will report periodically, on https://forum.cow.fi on progress and adjust strategies based on feedback and evolving market conditions.\n\nRationale\nEffective business development and marketing are essential for attracting new users and building partnerships. The Service Provider will tailor strategies using proven techniques like SEO/SEM, content marketing, social media marketing, and lead generation to expand CoW DAO’s reach and impact. This collaboration will empower CoW DAO to align its growth trajectory with user needs and establish itself as a leading decentralized exchange platform.\n\nAlternate designs, such as internal execution of the Service, were considered but deemed less effective due to a lack of specialized expertise and the need for quick, market-aligned responses.\n\nThe proposed partnership approach ensures that the marketing and business development efforts will be executed by experts while remaining closely aligned with CoW DAO’s objectives and values.\n\nI. Services\nThe Service Provider agrees to deliver to CoW DAO the Service as defined above.\n\nThe Service Provider shall collaborate closely with CoW DAO to understand their business objectives and tailor services to align with the CoW DAO’s brand identity and target market. The Service Provider will employ various digital marketing and business development techniques, including but not limited to SEO/SEM, social media marketing,and other relevant strategies to raise brand awareness and drive business growth.\n\nCoW DAO will provide the necessary information and access required to facilitate these services effectively.\n\nAll activities and results will be reviewed and reported periodically, as outlined in the agreed-upon service timeline.\n\nII. Compensation\nFixed compensation - CoW DAO will allocate a budget of 20.000 USDC per month to compensate the Service Provider for the delivery of the Service, paid upfront\n\nThis compensation represents the Service Provider’s estimated costs for the provision of the Service. The proposed budget is based on projected labor, materials, and other direct/indirect costs to provide the Service.\n\nThe budget agreed upon for delivery of the Service is effective for the current term of this Agreement. In the event of any substantial changes to the budget or Service requiring an increased allocation requires the Service Provider to submit CIP to CoW DAO to adjust the fee on a monthly basis to account for actual costs incurred. Any such CIP is subject to the approval of CoW DAO’s Governance Mechanism as defined in CoW DAO’s Participation Agreement. In the event the Service Provider submits a fee adjustment proposal, it must provide a detailed account of costs incurred in the preceding months.\n\nService Fee for Third-Party Transactions - In addition to the monthly compensation, the Service Provider shall be entitled to collect a service fee for transactions facilitated with third-party partners on behalf of CoW DAO. Such a service fee shall not exceed 2.5% of such transaction value. All profits made from the Service Fee for Third-Party Transactions will be reinvested solely in accordance with CoW DAO’s vision of a decentralized future and its mission to enhance CoW DAO’s products and more generally the CoW ecosystem.\n\nCompensation should be transferred to eth:0x5FD8a90b910D7BE482068Db5b2B88eC9Eb0dF7A0 by the Treasury Core Team.\n\nIII. Terms of the Service Agreement\nValidity\n\nThis Agreement is subject to the approval of CoW DAO’s Governance Mechanism as defined in CoW DAO’s Participation Agreement.

      "content": "```\nCIP: 45\ntitle: Balancer & Cow Protocol Strategic Partnership – Launching CoWAMM Pools\nauthor: Haris Angelidakis, Andrea Canidio, Felix Henneke, Mike_B & karpatkey\nstatus: Active\ncreated: 2024-06-17\n```\n\n_Note: This proposal is a result of discussions between BalancerDAO, CowDAO and karpatkey, initially posted on the [Balancer](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-xxx-balancer-x-cow-protocol-strategic-partnership-cowamm/5766) and [Cow](https://forum.cow.fi/t/cip-draft-balancer-and-cow-jointly-creating-cowamm-pools/2429) forums. Given the suggested modifications, this updated version summarizes the technical content and consolidates all changes for clarity and organization. For further information and context, please refer to the original proposals posted on each forum._\n\n## Executive Summary\nWe propose a strategic partnership between BalancerDAO and CowDAO to develop CoWAMM pools on Balancer. The CoW Protocol settlement contract will gain privileged access to certain Balancer pools, and these pools will be treated as CoWAMMs, earning surplus in CoW Protocol’s solver competition, ensuring they always trade at the correct price and eliminating LVR.\n\n## Motivation\nBalancer and Cow Protocol share the vision of making DeFi accessible and safe. Balancer is a leading AMM provider, while Cow Protocol is a leading intent-based trade aggregator. The collaboration aims to establish CoWAMM as the dominant LVR-resistant AMM design, increasing liquidity provider returns and overall liquidity.\n\n## The Collaboration\nCreating a Balancer/CoWAMM pool involves granting the CoW Protocol settlement contract (and its solvers) exclusive or privileged access to specific Balancer pools. Beyond this, Balancer/CoWAMM pools will function like other Balancer pools, utilizing the same UI (with co-branding elements) and infrastructure. Liquidity deposited in these pools will receive the same veBAL incentives as other Balancer pools, along with additional incentives detailed below.\n\n## Incentive Alignments: Token Swap and Additional BAL Rewards\nTo align incentives, a milestone-contingent token swap is proposed:\n\nAt launch, both DAOs will swap an equivalent of USD 500k worth of their native tokens and commit to holding them for at least two years from the date of this agreement passing a vote on Snapshot. Tokens can be used for strategic objectives but both DAOs will refrain from selling them during the aforementioned term.\n\nWhen TVL of CoWAMM/Balancer pools reaches USD 50M, each DAO will swap USD 1M worth of tokens, with the same two-year restriction.\n\nWhen TVL reaches USD 100M, another USD 1M token swap will occur, also locked for two years.\n\n## Additional incentives include:\n\nRevenues from Balancer/CoWAMM pools will be equally shared between CowDAO and BalancerDAO.\n\nBalancerDAO will allocate USD 250k worth of discretionary BAL incentives to strategic CoW AMM pools to incentivize liquidity provision.\n\n## Initial Liquidity Seeding for Strategic CoWAMM Pools\nThere is significant value in launching CowAMM pools from the beginning. Testing this technology in a live environment signals the serious commitment of both DAOs to this partnership. The following strategic pools and seeding structures are proposed:\n\n**USDC/WETH Pool**: Initial liquidity of USD 1M. GnosisDAO will provide USD 500k, while Balancer and CoW DAOs will each contribute USD 250k. Given that CoW DAO already manages a USDC/WETH CoW AMM (the SAFE contract-based pilot) with higher liquidity than requested, CoW DAO commits to migrating the existing pool to a CoWAMM Balancer pool upon launch. Following a successful migration, GnosisDAO and BalancerDAO will add their committed liquidity to it.\n\nNative Token Pools: Two pools pairing the native token with WETH, with at least USD 500k liquidity each.\n\na. **BAL/WETH Pool**: Seeded entirely by BalancerDAO.\n\nb. **COW/WETH Pool**: CoW DAO will migrate its existing COW/WETH CoW AMM pool with an approximate TVL of USD 1M to a CoWAMM Balancer pool upon launch.\n\nFurther stages of liquidity seeding will be evaluated as needed. All parties involved (BalancerDAO, CoW DAO, and GnosisDAO) commit to abstaining from farming incentives derived from the initial liquidity seeded into these pools.\n\n## Implementation Details\nCoW DAO and BalancerDAO agree on the following implementation details:\n\nThe amount of tokens contributed to the strategic pools will be calculated using Chainlink prices at the time of pool creation. Pools will be created or migrated as soon as technically feasible.\n\nThe TVL of all CoWAMM/Balancer pools must continuously exceed a certain threshold for at least a week to be considered reached.\n\nFor the second and third steps of the token swap, the average price during the week before the TVL reaches the threshold will be used.\n\nThis partnership aims to create powerful synergy, enhancing both protocols and advancing their shared vision for DeFi. karpatkey is excited to contribute to this promising endeavor.",

      "title": "CIP-44: Reduced bonding requirements",
      "content": "```\nCIP: 44\ntitle: Reduced bonding requirements\nauthor: fleupold\nstatus: Active\ncreated: 2024-05-13\n```\n\n# Simple Summary\n\nIn order to become a solver on CoW Protocol, parties have to be vouched for by a so-called bonding pool, as specified in [CIP-7](https://snapshot.org/#/cow.eth/proposal/0x267edf7a0bd3c771cfca763322f011ee106d8d5158612c11da29183260d1dba7). These pools provide significant guarantees ($500k in stables and 1.5M COW) to the protocol and may get slashed by CoW DAO in case of misbehavior by one of its associated solvers.\n\nWhile there are 20 solver solving on CoW Protocol today, there are only two bonding pools covering those solvers:\n\n1. A Gnosis DAO sponsored bonding pool (vouching for 6 solvers)\n2. A CoW DAO sponsored bonding pool (vouching for 14 solvers)\n\nGnosis DAO is currently not accepting new external solvers to join and CoW DAO’s bonding pool poses some requirements and limitations under which solvers have to operate.\n\nThe goal of this proposal is to introduce a new type of setup with reduced bonding requirements which will incentivize more solvers to become bonded using their own resources, while maintaining existing security guarantees and allowing solvers to have more control over aspects of the competition they currently lack.\n\nIn this new setup solvers can get the right to manage their settlement submission private keys without passing any due diligence checks, thus providing a more permissionless experience while remaining capital efficient.\n\n# Motivation\n\nThe goal of this proposal is to foster decentralization, accelerate CoW DAO’s ability to deploy on new networks, improve the reliability of service while allowing for competition and innovation on more advanced aspects of the auction (ie. solution settlement).\n\nLet’s revisit CoW Protocol’s off-chain architecture:\n![image](ipfs://bafkreihaiqdx24xlxoh7sfqrkfbt4le5n2tz7inh4vi227iqauzwjdxhe4)\n    \n\nThe core protocol consists of the orderbook (which quotes and receives signed orders from users) as well as the autopilot, which prepares auction instances and facilitates the competition evaluation process.\n\nExternal solvers then can conceptually be split in two parts:\n\n1. The solver engine, whose task it is to compute the optimal solution to the batch auction instance at hand.\n2. The driver, which\n  a. pre-processes the auction (potentially filtering orders and fetching extra liquidity)\n  b. posts the winning solution back to the autopilot, and if selected, encodes and executes the settlement on-chain\n\nIt is important to note that the driver requires access to the private key with which solutions can be submitted on-chain.\n\nLet’s now look at the possible attacks a solver can perform:\n\n1. Losing settlement contract’s internal token balances through e.g. settling trades with excessive slippage, setting bad allowances on an external protocol, etc.\n2. Submitting a settlement for an auction they didn’t win or which doesn’t match the settlement they proposed during the auction\n\nWhile the risk of 1. is manageable by doing frequent withdrawals of buffers and “only” affects DAO resources (no user funds are at risk), 2. could potentially lead to users being systematically executed at their limit price (rather than at the fair uniform clearing price).\n\nThe damage that can be inflicted in this case depends on the limit prices (or surplus) as well as the number of trades that are exploited until the solver is deny-listed and has no strict upper bound.\n\nBecause of that, CoW DAO bonded solvers have so far not had access to their own private keys. Running their own driver would require them to create their own “full” bonding pool. Due to the large amount of capital required for that, this proposition hasn’t found any traction so far.\n\nThis proposal introduces reduced bonding requirements with which solvers are able to run their own driver while maintaining reasonable security guarantees for the protocol and its users. As mentioned above the benefit of doing this are manifold:\n\n### Foster Decentralization & Improve Reliability\n\nCoW DAO believes that permissionless innovation will outcompete gated and permissioned systems in the long run. Reducing capital requirements reduces the barrier to entry for new solvers. It also removes centralization points, which have been partially responsible for outages and downtimes in the past. We believe that heterogeneous implementations of the liquidity indexing, order filtering and solution submission logic will make the protocol more robust against single points of failure.\n\n### Accelerate Scaling\n\nCoW Protocol is currently only deployed on Mainnet and Gnosis Chain. Given the amount of off-chain infrastructure that currently needs to be deployed and maintained by the development team in order to add a new network, there is a limit to how fast we can expand the protocol to more chains.\n\nHaving fully co-located driver/solver-engines would simplify this work tremendously and only require a sufficient number of solvers to signal their willingness to support that chain.\n\n### Increase Competition\n\nSolvers already compete on liquidity as well as optimal matching strategies in order to give users the best deal possible. However, we believe that there is significant room for additional innovation when it comes to things like prioritizing which orders to include in the search, how to encode settlements in the most gas efficient way and also how to make sure a winning settlement gets included on-chain quickly and efficiently. For instance, solvers could wrap the settlement transaction in a transaction bundle containing other public mempool transactions, which are ordered in a way to give users even better execution (ie. by including non CoW Protocol trades in the opposite direction first).\n\n# Specification\n\nIntroduce a new reduced bonding requirement with a minimal initial deposit of:\n\n* $50k in yield bearing stable coins or ETH\n* 500k COW\n\nAnd a target deposit of:\n\n* $100k in yield bearing stable coins or ETH\n* 1M COW\n\nThe right to iterate on the set of eligible tokens (as well as define conversion rates for non stable tokens) shall be granted to the development team.\n\nSolvers that have provided the minimal initial deposit of $50k/500k COW are required to submit their solutions via the MEV Blocker RPC and have any refunds as well as 50% of their COW rewards go towards increasing the size of the bond until the target is reached. Solvers have to reach the target deposit within 1 year.\n\nSolvers that have provided the target deposit, or that are in the process of growing their initial deposit to the target deposit, are allowed to submit solutions from their own submission account provided they can provide a signature which will be given out by the autopilot attesting to the fact their solver indeed won the competition.\n\nFor providing these signatures, the development team will build and deploy a settlement contract facade, which itself can get allow-listed as a solver on the main settlement contract (GPv2Settlement). The facade will take the calldata required to call `settle` on the main contract as well as a signature.\nIt then checks the following things:\n1. The signature is indeed authored from the autopilot\n2. The signature has been granted to the `msg.sender`\n3. The signature attests to certain aspects of the `settle` payload (ie. orders that are included, clearing prices, a subset of pre/post interactions)\nand then forwards the call to the main settlement contract.\n![image](ipfs://bafkreidnxhvoiy5df2q6z3g2sr65js7q5xhf5343bsn4sdei24jdm245uy)\n\nTo further decentralize the system, such an “attestation” model could also be adopted by other independent parties that provide the “full bonding pool” (not just CoW DAO) and would like to define custom requirements for the participants of their pool.\n\n### Transition Period\n\nWe believe that building, auditing and testing the required on-chain verifier and off-chain signature logic may require a few weeks of development work. At the same time we would like to start testing co-located driver/solver-engines as soon as possible to identify other challenges and make progress toward co-located launches on L2s.\n\nWe therefore suggest that existing solvers, that have been part of the CoW DAO bonding pool for more than 6 months, and that pledge the initial minimal bonding requirements are allowed to run in co-located mode even before the autopilot signing has been implemented. They will be required to transition to signature provided settlements as soon as the system is ready.\n\n# Rationale\n\nThe introduction of the signature verifying contract allows the protocol to limit the damage a misbehaving solver can have on users (e.g. settling their order out of competition at limit price) by attesting to certain key aspects of the competition, while still giving solvers freedom to manage solution submission and other crucial aspects of running the driver.\n\nThe reduced bonding requirements are still large enough to cover any damages for misbehaviors described in point 1 above (loss of settlement contract funds) given the current withdrawal frequency of accrued funds. Misbehaviours of type 2 (settling out of competition) are mitigated by introducing the required attestation from the autopilot which will only be given out to the winning solver. The COW portion of the bond ensures continued incentive alignment between solvers and the DAO.\n\nAt the cost of extra settlement overhead (gas for signature verification and extra call), these reduced requirements keeps the DAO’s risk exposure neutral to the current status quo, while giving solvers additional incentive to work towards creating their own bonding pools.\n\nThe transition period makes sure we can move fast with already well established solvers to identify technical requirements beyond the ones already mentioned in this proposal. This will accelerate the speed with which CoW Protocol can be deployed to other chains.",

These require low funding amounts, but payments that are sent frequently (eg. network fees, testing, user studies etc.)\n\nCIP-25: Operational CoW DAO Safe, enacted a mandate to the Core Team to manage a 80 ETH (ca. 145k USD equivalent) budget for operational needs. As the CoW DAO Safe is now reaching lower than 10 ETH, this renewal CIP requests a top up for continued operations.\n\nThis CIP asks for a funding allocation of 50 ETH.\n\n\n## Motivation\nThis CIP asks to transfer 50 ETH (ca. 150k USD equivalent) from the CoW DAO Treasury (eth:0x616dE58c011F8736fa20c7Ae5352F7f6FB9F0669) to the CoW DAO Ops Safe (eth:0x46861c73480d35AA285f1420Ba80e76766F9885c).\n\nDuring the last 11 months (May 2023 to Apr 2024), the Ops Safe has mainly been involved in the funding of:\n\nGas and smart contract initiation costs\nTesting initiatives, namely:\n--- UX user interviews\n--- Frontend testing\n--- Fee mechanism testing\nETH Flow smart contracts top up\nBug Bounties , namely a bounty paid through Immunify\nTesting CoW AMMs and benchmarking to competitor AMMs\n\n[Analysis in the forum post]\n\nThese funds will be used as necessary in the development of the CoW Protocol Suite and related undertakings, namely:\n\n1. Deployment of smart contracts;\n2. Audit services for smart contracts;\n3. Bounties;\n4. Testing of features (like partial orders, milkman upgrades, and others);\n5. User studies;\n6. Funding of the ETHFlow refunder wallets;\n7. Funding for gas and signers;\n\nAll rules for the management of these funds follow from the initial CIP-25.\nAny unused funds from the Operational CoW DAO Safe can, at any moment, be withdrawn by CoW DAO’s main Safe and re-allocated for any other community-driven initiative.\n\nFurther top-ups will require a summarised expense report of prior funding along with another CIP.\n\nThe assets in the operational CoW DAO Safe will remain idle (no asset management).\n\n## Proposal\nTransfer 60 ETH (ca. 180k USD equivalent) into from the CoW DAO Treasury (eth:0x616dE58c011F8736fa20c7Ae5352F7f6FB9F0669) to the CoW DAO Ops Safe (eth:0x46861c73480d35AA285f1420Ba80e76766F9885c)",

      "content": "```\nCIP: 42\ntitle: Enhancing Treasury Asset Usage\nauthor: notsoformal.eth\nstatus: Active\ncreated: 2024-03-22  \n```\n\n## Simple Summary\n\nThis proposal redirects allocation of Safe tokens - after transferability is enabled - and redirects idle USDC from all CoW DAO Safes to the Treasury safe for active management. Additionally, this CIP gives mandate to the Core Team to collaborate with the treasury team and initiate running validators of GNO, accruing extra yield for the DAO.\n\n## Motivation\n\nThis CIP presents a strategic opportunity to optimize CoW DAO's financial position, foster growth, and further align its actions with the DAO's core values of transparency, decentralization, and innovation.\n\n## Proposal\n\n1. CoW DAO currently claimed from 4 eligible addresses 94.4k out of a 160.4k allocation of SAFE Tokens. Given the potential short term transability of the token being enacted - as per [this Safe DAO discussion](https://forum.safe.global/t/discussion-thread-token-transferability/4856/5) - this CIP proposes the operators of the following addresses to redirect all claimed and claimable (at the moment of transaction) SAFE tokens to the Treasury safe for active treasury management purposes.\n\n2. Additionally, this CIP proposes that the CoW DAO Signers redirect the holdings at the [CoW DAO daughter safe / KYCed funds Safe](https://app.safe.global/home?safe=eth:0xA1cb7762F40318ee0260F53e15De835fF001cb7E) , which amount to 49 876,064 USDC, to the Treasury safe for active treasury management purposes.\n\n3. Lastly, as per the [2023 treasury report](https://forum.cow.fi/t/karpatkey-2023-year-in-review-for-the-cow-dao-treasury/2257) the Treasury generated 128k in DeFi results with an average capital utilization of 96%. This capital utilization inefficiency comes mostly from idle GNO, which is currently not utilised. Given the passing of CIP-37, and the re-allocation of funds to the CoW AMM project, the treasury at the time of the [February 2024 Treasury report](https://reports.karpatkey.com/?dao=5&month=2&year=2024), had 2.6M USD in idle GNO. Hence, this CIP proposes to give a mandate to the CoW Core Team to allocate the entirely idle GNO in the Treasury to run validator in Gnosis Chain, specifying the Treasury Safe as the withdrawal / destination address for validator rewards, hence being the sole ultimate owner of funds. At a conservative estimate of 10% yield, this strategy could generate over 260k USD in GNO, further increasing CoW DAO runway and the exposure to the Gnosis ecossystem. Note that the Core Team is currently already running Gnosis Chain nodes and validators, hence having the sufficient technical knowledge to insource this task for the benefit of the DAO without exposing to higher counterparty risks of allocating significant assets to third parties not currently related to the project.\n\n## Execution\n\nExecution of this proposal requires parallel operations.\n\n\nOperation 1 - Redirect of SAFE Tokens\n\nFrom [CoW DAO KYC’ed Safe](https://app.safe.global/settings/setup?safe=eth%3A0xA1cb7762F40318ee0260F53e15De835fF001cb7E) to [Treasury Safe](https://app.safe.global/settings/setup?safe=eth:0x616dE58c011F8736fa20c7Ae5352F7f6FB9F0669)\n\nFrom [CoW DAO Safe](https://app.safe.global/home?safe=eth%3A0xcA771eda0c70aA7d053aB1B25004559B918FE662) to [Treasury Safe](https://app.safe.global/settings/setup?safe=eth:0x616dE58c011F8736fa20c7Ae5352F7f6FB9F0669)\n\nFrom [Solver Rewards Safe](https://app.safe.global/home?safe=eth:0xA03be496e67Ec29bC62F01a428683D7F9c204930) to [Treasury Safe](https://app.safe.global/settings/setup?safe=eth:0x616dE58c011F8736fa20c7Ae5352F7f6FB9F0669)\n\nFrom [CoW Team](https://app.safe.global/home?safe=eth:0x423cEc87f19F0778f549846e0801ee267a917935) to [Treasury Safe](https://app.safe.global/settings/setup?safe=eth:0x616dE58c011F8736fa20c7Ae5352F7f6FB9F0669)\n\nOperation 2 - Redirect of 49 876,064 USDC from [CoW DAO KYC’ed Safe](https://app.safe.global/settings/setup?safe=eth%3A0xA1cb7762F40318ee0260F53e15De835fF001cb7E) to [Treasury Safe](https://app.safe.global/settings/setup?safe=eth:0x616dE58c011F8736fa20c7Ae5352F7f6FB9F0669)",

      "title": "CIP-41: Claim and Delegate CoW DAO’s SHU Token Allocation",
      "content": "```\nCIP: 41\ntitle: Claim and Delegate CoW DAO’s SHU Token Allocation\nauthor: middleway.eth\nstatus: Active  \ncreated: 2024-03-22  \n```\n\n## Simple Summary\n\nIn December 2023 the *[Shutter Network Genesis Launch Program](https://blog.shutter.network/shutter-network-genesis-launch-program/)* was announced.\nDue to the involvement and contribution of the CoW team to MEV-mitigation reasearch and development, and thanks to  the ongoing collaboration with the Shutter team, CoW DAO was given an allocation of SHU tokens in the *Shutter Network Genesis Launch Program*.\n\nThis CIP proposes that CoW DAO claims its SHU token allocation from Sutter DAO and delegates these tokens to middleway.eth (0xA11DA8B2D9A7883eb636d7de426025e5fD9fda1A) as a representative of CoW DAO in Shutter DAO governance. This delegation aims to ensure that CoW DAO's strategic interests are represented within the Sutter DAO ecosystem, making use of the governance and utility potential of the SHU token.\n\n## Motivation\n\nThe aim of this proposal is two-fold: firstly, to actively participate in the governance of Sutter DAO to safeguard and advance CoW DAO's interests and broader vision; and secondly, to utilize middleway.eth's involvement and understanding of CoW DAO's ethos for this purpose. By leveraging their position and insight within the community, we can navigate Sutter DAO's governance effectively, in alignment with CoW DAO's principles of community-driven decision-making and strategic collaboration.\n\n## Specification\n\n1. **Claim CoW DAO's SHU allocation using the below Safe transaction**\n2. This transaction will create a vesting contract for CoW DAO. The address will be known only after execution, and therefore signers will be responsible for making the second transaction for delegating CoW DAO's voting rights to middleway.eth \n3. **Governance Participation**: middleway.eth will participate on behalf of CoW DAO in relevant discussions and decision making process within Shutter DAO. \nCoW DAO can evaluate and reconsider its delegation strategy in the future.\n\n## Rationale\n\nThis proposal allows CoW DAO to leverage its SHU tokens to influence Sutter DAO's trajectory positively and according to CoW DAO's interests and values. It reflects our strategy of thoughtful participation in governance to ensure our actions align with our long-term vision.\n\n## Execution\nExecution of this proposal requires two steps.\n1. The first step of claiming SHU tokens will be automatically executed if this proposal passes quorum, according to the below safe transaction. \n2. The second step will make use of the newly created vesting contract to delegate CoW DAO's voting rights to middleway.eth. This step will be executed by safe signers since at this point the contract address cannot be deterministically determined. \n### Safe Transaction Data\n\n```\n{\n  \"version\": \"1.0\",\n  \"chainId\": \"1\",\n  \"createdAt\": 1711026794785,\n  \"meta\": {\n    \"name\": \"Transactions Batch\",\n    \"description\": \"\",\n    \"txBuilderVersion\": \"1.16.3\",\n    \"createdFromSafeAddress\": \"0x616dE58c011F8736fa20c7Ae5352F7f6FB9F0669\",\n    \"createdFromOwnerAddress\": \"\",\n    \"checksum\": \"0x2308755c2eb230c0cd6235894b702e712c025daf20aff66f013269dd53505d4b\"\n  },\n  \"transactions\": [\n    {\n      \"to\": \"0x024574C4C42c72DfAaa3ccA80f73521a4eF5Ca94\",\n      \"value\": \"0\",\n      \"data\": null,\n      \"contractMethod\": {\n        \"inputs\": [\n          {\n            \"internalType\": \"uint8\",\n            \"name\": \"curveType\",\n            \"type\": \"uint8\"\n          },\n          {\n            \"internalType\": \"uint16\",\n            \"name\": \"durationWeeks\",\n            \"type\": \"uint16\"\n          },\n          {\n            \"internalType\": \"uint64\",\n            \"name\": \"startDate\",\n            \"type\": \"uint64\"\n          },\n          {\n            \"internalType\": \"uint128\",\n            \"name\": \"amount\",\n            \"type\": \"uint128\"\n          },\n          {\n            \"internalType\": \"uint128\",\n            \"name\": \"initialUnlock\",\n            \"type\": \"uint128\"\n          },\n          {\n            \"internalType\": \"bytes32[]\",\n            \"name\": \"proof\",\n            \"type\": \"bytes32[]\"\n          },\n          {\n            \"internalType\": \"bool\",\n            \"name\": \"requiresSPT\",\n            \"type\": \"bool\"\n          }\n        ],\n        \"name\": \"redeem\",\n        \"payable\": false\n      },\n      \"contractInputsValues\": {\n        \"curveType\": \"0\",\n        \"durationWeeks\": \"103\",\n        \"startDate\": \"1711580400\",\n        \"amount\": \"1233140655105970000000000\",\n        \"initialUnlock\": \"123314065510597000000000\",\n        \"proof\": \"[\\\"0x9346178433d2193598aa9f4d898721fa268b9e1e7396f1cb0bfe612f766d20aa\\\",\\\"0x0f1edf16cb13fbb2706ee1ffcb9c27126ff416e6deb371cea060b6bf349bedc8\\\",\\\"0xe615fd74c1cf7d804fd11d70cdc5109f782b43cc79faac7b47a38aa2d949ebd2\\\",\\\"0x50b75e10222cc7bba3b0a40d1b2525b908a2aa5b94d482cc75c762666ed5ea2c\\\",\\\"0xd7671e32ccccfcbe6cd0c8fef92862e2cc508f085b56376245be64dbc8df77f6\\\",\\\"0xde6a4e8d57d0508f14235c0191945120b15dd1c2c298bb4734d410ae3d678c92\\\",\\\"0x12ebcdd50bb884ba3c5240d13a7953b8f0e240914e3fefc76216ed2f9fe93e99\\\",\\\"0xbb139cc440a8659270e26831ea13f179de4f35aa4259c2c64551c4beef000963\\\",\\\"0x3c9d0f06fc55d0678bdb5e8c8f65ea888a3e23700696ede67f15d749f1dec83f\\\",\\\"0xf9a11e0dade091251382399739dbc6f582cde5e5cb69fbf96b9d9fb08735db9a\\\",\\\"0xc2da4db4214bc5fa9626e81dc1a8c0bfd9c0264bfb4391864e2ae4569ea516b1\\\",\\\"0x05556fe25769056b020d70afa516fe6c3be41c483a38b78e833fb8d6c6f75bdd\\\",\\\"0x492c480c4b2a6e053310569c12d2a9a6530f56911bcb40503fd04c53ef6df50f\\\",\\\"0x149b0b71fe82bfe38a508f305d202c70ce40606e81697a61bcd418e00754c489\\\"]\",\n        \"requiresSPT\": \"false\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n### Tenderly Simulation\n\nhttps://dashboard.tenderly.co/public/safe/safe-apps/simulator/abc4f5da-25fc-4eca-a99b-af2ee9af6f0d",

      "title": "CIP-40: MEV Blocker fees",
      "content": "```\nCIP: 40\ntitle: MEV Blocker fees\nauthor: Haris Angelidakis, Andrea Canidio, Felix Henneke\nstatus: Active\ncreated: 2024-03-26\n```\n\nMEV Blocker was created by CoW DAO, Beaver Build, and Agnostic Relay to allow anyone to safely use Ethereum, guaranteeing fast inclusion time, protection from MEV attacks, and providing rebates whenever there are profitable backrunning opportunities arising from their transactions. Achieving this ambitious objective requires a source of revenue to support the technical maintenance of the product and to drive continuous growth in users’ adoption. As of today, MEV blocker has no revenue sources.\n\nThis CIP introduces a new fee mechanism for MEV blocker. The fee is charged to connected builders and is a fixed amount per block won. This amount is updated monthly and is a fraction of the average per-block value of MEV blocker transactions during the previous month. Note that MEV blocker users will not be affected by the fee.\n\n## The Fee Mechanism\n\nAll builders connected to MEV Blocker will pay a per-block won fee recomputed every period (for example, every month). In practice, at the beginning of period *t* a builder decides whether to receive flow from MEV blocker. If it decides to do so, for every block won during period *t* it will pay a per-block fee calculated as a percentage of the the average per-block value of exclusive MEV Blocker transactions during the previous period. Mathematically, the per-block fee in period *t* is a percentage of\n\n`M=(A-B)/C`\n\nWhere\n\n* `A` = Total MEV Blocker transaction value during period *t-1*, excluding rebates\n* `B` = total value of MEV blocker transactions also in the mempool during period *t-1*.\n* `C` = number of blocks mined by builders receiving MEV blocker transactions during period *t-1*\n\nInitially, the fee will be 20% of the above value, and the period t will be 1 month, but these variables may be adjusted later (without requiring a new CIP). Note that the fact that the fee is per block does not mean that it will be paid with each block: we will keep track of it off-chain and settle it weekly via a payment to a dedicated Safe. Hence, the settlement period for the payment (one week) differs from the frequency at which the per-block won fee is computed (one month). CoW DAO will receive 50% of the funds received by the dedicated Safe, with the rest forwarded to our partners. This [dune query ](https://dune.com/queries/3560043/5990842)calculates the fee for the past 12 months (note that the query is preliminary and may be updated). The per-block won fee for March would have been 0.00048 ETH, and that for April (according to March data so far) will be 0.00059 ETH.\n\nBuilders must also make a 10ETH deposit to a separate smart contract managed by MEV blocker partners. These funds will cover late fees and other costs generated by builders (for example, in case they leak MEV blocker transactions to the public mempool). The deposit will be returned to builders who decide to disconnect from MEV blocker and are in good standing.\n\nWe’ll compute the value of the per-block won fee using publicly available data, in a format that is easy to verify (for example, as a Dune query). We’ll then post its value onchain for easy access by builders. Similarly, we’ll use publicly available data and easy-to-verify scripts to keep track of the total fee each builder should pay and the flow of payments.\n\nFinally, for builders who won fewer than 1% of blocks during a given week, the fee will be adjusted so that these builders pay as if they won exactly 1% of blocks during the week. In practice, during period *t*, at the end of each week these builders pay\n\n`1% (total blocks mint during the previous week) * 20% M`\n\nThe rationale for this adjustment is that connecting a builder to MEV blocker poses a risk because of the potential leaking of transactions to the public mempool, which should be evaluated against the benefit of faster inclusion of MEV blocker transactions. We believe the risk outweighs the benefit for builders who win less than 1% of blocks. Although we do not want to penalize builders who may temporarily fall below this threshold too harshly, we also want to discourage long-tail builders from connecting in the first place.\n\n## Why this fee mechanism?\n\nAn intuitive notion of fairness dictates that each builder should pay for the value of MEV Blocker transactions it uses. At the same time, an important objective of the mechanism is to be as non-distortionary as possible: it should not affect the decision to include or not include a transaction by a builder. A fee constructed simply as a fraction of the tip of each MEV Blocker transaction risks creating distortion. Furthermore, on the implementation side, it would require a new API.\n\nThe proposed solution instead does not require any new API and is unlikely to create distortions. It is also built to be correct *on average*: if builders do not disconnect and win more or less the same fraction of blocks between periods, they end up paying with a month delay the average value of MEV transactions they received during the previous week.\n\nIt is also important to stress that this is the first iteration of the fee mechanism. For example, in the future, we may compute the fee as a fraction of the MEV Blocker tx value included by non-winning builders for the same slot. Intuitively, that would be a proxy for the value from MEV Blocker available to the winning builder, independent of this builder’s decision to include this or that transaction. This mechanism cannot be implemented now because Agnostic relay does not store any data regarding blocks built by non-winning builders, but this could change later.\n\n## Who pays the fee?\n\nTo understand who pays the fee incidence, we need to consider two cases. If a single builder receives MEV Blocker flow, then introducing the fee is at the expense of this builder’s profits: if this builder wins, it wins less (by an amount equal to the fee) and is less likely to win because it will bid lower. If, for simplicity, we ignore this second effect, on average, the builder pays 20% of the value of MEV transactions as a fee while keeping the remaining 80% as profits.\n\nAt the other extreme, suppose that all builders are connected to MEV Blocker, and hence, after the fee is introduced, they all have to pay it. Now, for all builders, winning a block is less valuable by an amount equal to the fee. For the moment, let’s think of the auction as a second-price auction: the winning builder is the one who bids the highest but only pays the second-highest bid. One of the most famous results in auction theory is that, in a second-price auction, bidders should bid their true valuation, which for each builder is the value of its block minus MEV blocker fee. This implies that the winning bidder earns the value of its block minus MEV blocker fee, and pays in the auction the second-highest bid, which is the second most valuable block minus MEV blocker fee. Hence, the winning builder earns less but pays less, and its profit margin remains the same. In equilibrium, the only impact of MEV blocker’s fee is that all bids are lower, and hence, payments to validators are lower. In equilibrium, the fee is paid indirectly by the validator.\n\nNote that the auction is not exactly a second-price auction. It starts as an ascending English auction, where bidders gradually increase their bids. Due to latency, the final part is similar to a first-price sealed bid auction. Despite these complexities, the auction's dynamics are similar to a second-price auction because each builder aims to outbid the second-highest bid by a small margin. Also, since the value a builder gets from creating a block doesn't depend on other builders' blocks (i.e., the auction is in private values), the revenue equivalence theorem says that all auction formats yield the same expected payoff to its participants. Hence, even if the auction is not in second price, we can analyze its equilibrium as if it were in second price.\n\nTo summarize, our hope is that the majority of builders will stay connected to MEV Blocker and that the fee will reduce the payments to validators (i.e., MEV). At the same time, we expect the mechanism to be overall beneficial to builders, including in the case where only one or a few builders connect (and end up paying the fee out of their profits).\n\n## Possible challenges\n\nThe main possible challenge (and where the above reasoning would fail) is when all builders have blocks of very low value, so imposing a fee turns the value of winning negative. Theoretically, this may lead to builders not bidding and the block being empty.\n\nTo check whether this possibility is empirically relevant, we calculated what the fee would have been and checked how many times the block won by a builder had a lower value than the fee (see this [Dune query](https://dune.com/queries/3565473)). We found 18 such cases in 2024 so far. For context, there were more than 630.000 blocks mined so far in 2024.\n\nA final issue is that the mechanism is designed to be “correct” on average, in the sense that, on average, a builder who does not disconnect pays with one period delay 20% of the value of MEV blocker transactions it received. However, averages may be misleading, especially for small builders. Therefore, for each connected builder, we will keep track of the value of MEV blocker transactions received during a month and the total fee paid to MEV blocker in the subsequent month. If we find cases in which the fee paid exceeds the value received, we will consider adjustments to the fee mechanism (for example, instead of charging 20%, charging 15% or 10%).",

      "content": "```\nCIP: 39\ntitle: Continued funding for development services - Service Agreement No 3 author: @Kowrigan\nstatus: active\ncreated: 2024-03-21\n```\n# Simple Summary\n\nThis is a truncated version of the full Service Agreement. Please refer to the forum post for full details: https://forum.cow.fi/t/cip-draft-continued-funding-for-development-services-service-agreement-no-3/2336 \n\nThis CoW Improvement Proposal (“CIP”) requests the DAO to approve the allocation of 3,850,000 USD from the treasury to Nomev Labs, Lda (the “Service Provider”) for the execution of the Services under the terms of the Service Agreement hereunder (the “Agreement”). The compensation will cover the Service Provider's labor and expenses on a per-use basis for the period **from 1 March 2024 to 31 December 2024** (the “Term”).\n\nThe requested funds, if approved, would as:\n\n* **1,500,000 USDC** of KYCed funds that was previously set aside in the DAO treasury; and\n* **1,500,000 USD** of non-KYCed funds.\n\nThe addition of non-KYCed funds to the request answers the necessity for the DAO to keep a substantial amount of KYCed funds for potential activities requiring KYCed funds.\n\nOverall, this will leave a total of more than 700 thousand USDC KYCed funds at CoW DAO’s disposal (of which 2.2M currently in use by CoW DAO’s Core Treasury Team, cf. passed CIP-19 proposal, and the remaining 49,876 USDC in the CoW DAO’s Daughter Safe). \n\n# Motivation \n\nThe Service Provider remains committed to fulfilling CoW DAO’s vision of a decentralised future where digital assets can be traded in a fair, efficient and reliable manner among people and communities around the world. Trades, liquidity provision, and any blockchain transaction must be securely protected, no matter who the user is.\n\nWe consider this CIP critical to ensure ongoing development and refinement of the CoW Suite and for keeping a competitive edge within the decentralised exchange ecosystem, including strategic pivots. \n\n# I. Service \n\n## I.a Services \n\nThe Service Provider will provide the CoW DAO with the services as outlined hereunder (the \"Service\").\n\n* Code development and design based on Section 1.b below ;\n* Continuous improvement of the existing product and user experience; \n* Executing relevant user research and proposing development focus adjustments based on its findings; \n* On behalf of CoW DAO, hosting relevant interfaces, upkeeping and housekeeping of forum.cow.fi; \n* Assisting the CoWmunity in the promotion of the CoW Suite, including at and for conferences and with promotional materials; \n* Engaging in, and maintaining the activity of participating in the consensus of  proof of stake blockchains such as but not limited to Gnosis Chain as part of the DAO’s treasury management\n* Fostering collaborations and partnerships on behalf of CoW DAO; \n* Any other assistance and advice that may be provided by the team’s expertise, e.g. computer engineering, design as well as relevant project management, accounting services, legal, compliance, and other relevant fields of expertise; \n* Facilitating solver onboarding, vetting and assisting with payouts on behalf of CoW DAO; \n* Ensuring system security, providing development operations and security personnel. Per need, driving bug bounties for CoW DAO’s settlement (incl. via Grants DAO); \n* Engaging the CoWmunity in the decision making process using the regular governing mechanism; \n* Effective outsourcing to specialists and external parties. \n\nOther Services may be included in further CIPs for CoW DAO to decide upon separately (they can but must not lead to additional funding requests, dependent on scope, timing and efforts). \n\n## I.b Main Development Focus\n\nWe propose that the rest of the year 2024 be dedicated to the below  items and features. This list is not exhaustive and may evolve based on the CoWMunity feedbacks, decision and change of priorities: \n\n* Network expansion: deploying CoW Protocol to other Ethereum based networks\n* CoW AMM: expanding on the functionality of CoW AMM \n* MEV Blocker: improvements to MEV Blocker \n* Continuous experimentations around fee models, according to CIP-34\n* Continuous decentralization of the CoW protocol\n* Development of a Smart Contract Version 2 for CoW Protocol enabling advanced functionalities such as NFT support; enforcement of post order interactions; etc.\n* Support for additional smart orders (such as DCA, stop loss, etc)\n* Support for a CoW Hook UI and SDK allowing for easy integration by partners\n\n\n## I.c Budget \n\nFrom 1st of March 2024  - 31 Dec 2024, the USD budget estimate comprises the following significant positions:\n\n| Cost Center | Budget | \n| -------- | -------- |\nTeam compensation (aggregate)   | 2,630,000     |\nThird party services | 230,000\nEvents & Travel | 240,000\nHosting | 240,000\nExternal tooling | 100,000\nOffice | 60,000\nTax Provision | 350,000\n**Total** | **3,850,000**\n\n\nThese categories are estimated to include the following positions: \n* Team compensation - Includes total compensation of team members for the rest of service period. \n* Third party services - Includes all outsourcing providers and financial intermediaries & banking fees as well as third party development providers. \n* Events & Travel - Covers relevant presence in conferences, business development events as well as team meetings. \n* Hosting - Covers mainly DevOps related expenditures (AWS and nodes). \n* External tooling - Covers softwares and subscriptions. \n* Office - Includes fees supported for temporary rental of spaces. \n* Tax provision - lump sum provision of 10% for potential tax costs (unforeseen and relating to various tax categories) \n* Accounting provisions (such as tax provisions) that are dissolved, arising in a positive cash-flow, will be reinvested in line with CoW DAO’s vision of a decentralised future and mission of enhancing the CoW Suite. Remaining funds from the execution of this CIP as well as other financial decisions in the upcoming year may prolong the estimated length of the Service Agreement. \n\n# II. Terms of the Service Agreement \n\n## Validity\n\nThis Agreement is subject to the approval of CoW DAO's Governance Mechanism as defined in CoW DAO's Participation Agreement. In the event CoW DAO does not approve this Agreement through its Governance Mechanism, this Agreement shall be null and void.\n\n## Term and Termination\n\nThis Agreement shall commence on the 1st  March 2024 and shall remain in full force and effect until the 31st December 2024 (the \"Term\"). CoW DAO and the Service Provider agree that this Agreement cannot be terminated before expiry of the Term. Notwithstanding the foregoing, should funds remain available to continue the mandate provided by this Agreement,  the Agreement shall continue in effect until such funds are exhausted. The Service Provider shall notify CoW DAO in advance regarding the continuation of the Agreement and the estimated period for which the remaining funds will support its operation.\n\n## Compensation\n\nCoW DAO will compensate the Service Provider a fee of 3,850,000 USD for the delivery of the Services.\n\nThis fee represents the Service Provider's estimated costs for the Term. Estimates are based on projected labor, materials, and other direct/indirect costs to provide the Services.\n\nThe budget agreed upon for delivery of the Services is effective for the current term of this Agreement. In the event of any substantial changes to the budget or Services requiring an increased allocation requires the Service Provider to submit CIP to CoW DAO to adjust the fee on a monthly basis to account for actual costs incurred. Any such CIP is subject to the approval of CoW DAO's Governance Mechanism as defined in CoW DAO's Participation Agreement. In the event the Service Provider submits a fee adjustment proposal, it must provide a detailed account of costs incurred in the preceding months.\n\nIn the event the Service Provider releases or sell any accounting provisions (including but not limited to tax provisions), the resulting positive cash flow shall be reinvested solely into the Service Provider's operations, in accordance with CoW DAO's vision of a decentralized future and its mission to enhance the CoW Suite.\n\n## Payment \n\nUpon approval of this CIP, CoW DAO agrees to a prepayment in full of the approved fee to the Service Provider. \n\nUnless the Service Provider asks for further compensation due to incorrect estimation no detailed time report will be provided by the Service Provider to CoW DAO.\n\nThis prepayment constitutes the only compensation owed to the Service Provider for delivery of the Services over the engagement term, unless amended by a future DAO vote.\n\nUpon approval of this CIP the prepayment of funds to the Service Provider will be transferred from the DAO's treasury via the established financial processes.\n\n## Intellectual Property \n\n[...] \nPlease refer to the forum post for full details: https://forum.cow.fi/t/cip-draft-continued-funding-for-development-services-service-agreement-no-3/2336 \n## Miscellaneous\n[...]\nPlease refer to the forum post for full details: https://forum.cow.fi/t/cip-draft-continued-funding-for-development-services-service-agreement-no-3/2336\n\n## Execution \nSafe Transaction Data:\nSend 1.500.000 USDC from the KYC’ed pool from the treasury safe eth:0x616dE58c011F8736fa20c7Ae5352F7f6FB9F0669 to eth:0x1D579bc0459d75a1cF74cf878617ed9Fcafdf8E2\nSend 1.500.000 USDC from non KYC’ed pool from the treasury safe eth:0x616dE58c011F8736fa20c7Ae5352F7f6FB9F0669 to eth:0x1D579bc0459d75a1cF74cf878617ed9Fcafdf8E2",

      "title": "CIP-38: Solver Computed Fees & Rank by Surplus",
      "content": "```\nCIP: 38\ntitle: Solver Computed Fees & Rank by Surplus\nauthor: @felixhenneke, @AndreaC, @harisang\nstatus: active\ncreated:  2023-11-28\n```\n## Simple summary\n\nCurrently, CoW Protocol collects fees from users and then uses these fees to reimburse solvers’ gas costs. We instead propose that solvers collect a “network fee” directly to cover their gas costs. This would mean eliminating our current fees and ranking solutions based on surplus alone.\n\nWith the proposed changes we also simplify the collection of protocol fees (as introduced in [CIP-34](https://snapshot.org/#/cow.eth/proposal/0xe358941aa3f3aeaf94d40e6904c9bb530c98f88e363c2f309d9898b0ffb16c1f)). Such fees are collected by solvers on behalf of the protocol and paid to the CoW DAO in COW tokens.\n\n## Motivation\n\nToday, CoW protocol reimburses solvers' gas costs by collecting fees from users. Gas costs and fees are, however, not directly connected in the solver competition. This is inefficient for multiple reasons:\n* The benefit of batching orders (in terms of gas savings) is not always correctly passed on to users.\n* The protocol must monitor fees set by solvers, adding complexity.\n\nThis CIP proposes that we eliminate our current fee and stop reimbursing solvers for gas. In practice, we propose to stop reimbursing solvers for gas by ranking solutions based on “surplus” alone and rewarding the winning solver:\n\n`cap(surplus - second_highest_surplus)`\n\npaid in COW. Solvers would, therefore, no longer be guaranteed to receive a reward greater than their expenditure in gas costs, and will need to cover these costs by charging accurate fees. Competition between solvers guarantees that these fees equal gas costs, which is one of the main goals that motivated this proposed change.\n\nEliminating the current fees simplifies the protocol and how CoW DAO charges protocol fees (introduced in [CIP-34](https://snapshot.org/#/cow.eth/proposal/0xe358941aa3f3aeaf94d40e6904c9bb530c98f88e363c2f309d9898b0ffb16c1f)). We propose that the protocol fee should be collected by solvers on behalf of CoW Protocol and then reimbursed weekly to the protocol in COW (the currency used for solver rewards). The protocol fee therefore introduces a new utility for the COW token (and a new source of demand, as part of normal protocol operations) that should positively impact its price. Maintaining a healthy token is in the interest of CoW DAO, so this should be seen as a positive development for CoW DAO and COW token holders.\n\nFinally, we want to clarify that the above proposal does not incur any change in the quotes the users will be receiving, and the only difference is that the users would be signing zero-fee orders while the limit prices would remain unchanged.\n\n## Specification\n\nSolutions submitted by solvers contain orders together with their sell, buy, and fee amounts (specified in the sell token), and prices for all tokens traded by orders in the solution. The quality of a solution is now defined as the sum of surplus of the different orders, measured in ETH; the conversion to ETH will be done the same way it is done now, i.e., via the native prices vector provided in the auction instance sent to solvers. The solver whose solution has the largest quality wins the solver competition and executes their solution. Following a second-price mechanism (similar to CIP-20), a winning solver who successfully executes its solution on chain, is paid\n\n`cap(winning_quality - reference_quality)`\n\nin COW tokens, and own all fees they collected in the settlement. The `reference_quality` is the quality of the second best solution or set to zero if there is only one solution.\n\nOn the other hand, if the winning solver fails to execute their solution on chain, they pay a penalty equal to\n\n`cap(reference_quality)`.\n\nThe (asymmetric) capping of rewards and penalties is currently specified in [CIP-36](https://snapshot.org/#/cow.eth/proposal/0x4e58f9c1208121c0e06282b5541b458bc8c8b76090263e25448848f3194df986). As with CIP-20, the rewards will only apply to Ethereum Mainnet.\n\nFor a solution to be valid we require the following properties. Let a user send `Y` tokens of A and receive `X` tokens of B. The solver sets a fee `f` in the sell token A. The reported prices for A and B are `p_A` and `p_B`, respectively. Then uniform clearing prices need to hold:\n\n`(Y - f) / X = p_B / p_A.` [Uniform Clearing Prices, UCP]\n\nIn addition, we require\n\n`Y / X = const` [Uniform directional prices, UDP]\n\non all trades selling A and buying B.\n\nThe UCP rule is the same as the one we currently use. The rule on directional prices is new and  means that all users trading on a token pair see the same effective exchange rate (i.e., exchange rate after fees). \n\nNote that UDP only specifies how fees are distributed within a single directed token pair. However, it does not provide rules/guidelines on batches where there are multiple disjoint orders getting settled. For that, we will invoke the EBBO and social consensus rules to ensure that no order is treated unfairly, and this entails each order getting charged a reasonable fee that is proportional to the gas cost it incurs within a batch. Moreover, the whole batch should pay a fee corresponding to the gas cost of executing the batch. In practice, we expect solvers to exercise common sense and charge reasonable fees to user orders, and the core team commits to proper monitoring of all settlements that take place so that such rules are checked on a per settlement basis. In case a solver intentionally misbehaves and violates some of the above rules, the DAO, via a vote, could slash a solver and its bond.\n\n### Ranking and network fees\n\nWith this proposal, solvers compute fees for all orders and the protocol stops accepting orders with a positive signed fee. This allows solvers to give all benefits from cost reductions to users. We note that solvers can already set fees for a subset of orders, namely the so-called limit orders. Within the previous ranking and payment mechanism, however, solvers were not explicitly incentivized to choose accurate fees. This changes with this proposal. With this proposal, all user fees are determined and owned by solvers, and these fees are removed from the ranking and reward mechanism. This creates an incentive for solvers to choose fees to exactly cover execution costs of batches.\n\nThe rule on directional uniform prices determines the distribution of fees across orders on the same token pair. It effectively means that fees are split proportional to volume. This rule thus provides additional guarantees for fairness on top of the current rules on uniform clearing prices.\n\nThe total fee on the batch as well as the distribution of fees of orders on different token pairs are not restricted by hard rules within the mechanism yet. The main protection for users in this case is through social consensus rules (e.g., EBBO). In particular it is not allowed to shift large fractions of fees of a batch to orders not responsible for correspondingly large parts of executions. This is a form of shifting surplus, forbidden by our current social consensus rules on provision of unfair prices (as specified in [CIP-11](https://snapshot.org/#/cow.eth/proposal/0x16d8c681d52b24f1ccd854084e07a99fce6a7af1e25fd21ddae6534b411df870)).\n\nWe keep the second-price auction character of the competition from CIP-20, i.e., we reward solvers on how much their solutions improve upon those of the rest of the competition. \n\nSolvers might choose to collect tokens from network fees in the settlement contract. We propose to treat those funds as slippage. This means that all buffer changes from a settlement are converted to ETH and paid to solvers in ETH once a week.\n\n### Extension to protocol fee\n\nThe mechanism described above can be extended to allow for a protocol fee (introduced in [CIP-34](https://snapshot.org/#/cow.eth/proposal/0xe358941aa3f3aeaf94d40e6904c9bb530c98f88e363c2f309d9898b0ffb16c1f)) collected by solvers on behalf of the protocol. In that case, the quality of a solution is the sum of the surplus of the different orders and the protocol fees collected; the rationale being that solvers should still try to maximize the “size of the pie” and then distribute it accordingly to users and the protocol.\n\nFor each order, in addition to the sell, buy, and network fee amount, there is a protocol fee of `f_{p,sell}` and `f_{p,buy}` denominated in the sell token A or buy token B, respectively. The equation for uniform clearing prices then becomes\n\n`(Y - f - f_{p,sell}) / (X + f_{p,buy}) = p_B / p_A.`\n\nThe equation for uniform directional prices becomes\n\n`(Y - f_{p,sell}) / (X + f_{p,buy}).`\n\nFrom the practical viewpoint, solvers collect the protocol fee (for example, by accumulating it in the settlement contract as positive slippage) and forward it to the protocol once a week as part of the weekly payouts. We will later decide whether the protocol fee is paid back to the protocol in COW or in ETH (and hence is netted out from one of the two payments). If the protocol fee is collected in ETH, it will be converted automatically into COW.\n\n## Timeline\n\nWe propose the following timeline:\n* Before the start of the new ranking, fixed-fee in-market orders from CoW Swap and third-party integrators will be continuously phased out in favor of zero-fee orders.\n* Starting on **19.3.2024** the new ranking by surplus is used in the competition.\n* The first payout based on surplus is on 26.3.2024.\n* Starting on 19.3.2024 orders with a non-zero fee are rejected by the protocol.\n* After 4 weeks of running the new ranking, we will analyze the caps for rewards. The caps will be reduced in case of overspending (with respect to the budget defined in CIP-36) and increased in case of underspending, as an amendment to [CIP-36](https://snapshot.org/#/cow.eth/proposal/0x4e58f9c1208121c0e06282b5541b458bc8c8b76090263e25448848f3194df986). At this time we will also start with automatic conversion of protocol fees to COW tokens.",

      "content": "```\nCIP: 37\ntitle: Increasing liquidity for the COW token via Programmatic Order Framework and FM-AMM\nauthor: @AndreaC, @felixhenneke, @harisang\nstatus: active\ncreated: 2024-02-07\n```\n\n### Simple summary\nWe propose that the DAO allocates 6M COW and 139 WETH to increase COW/WETH market liquidity. To avoid price impact, 2.5M COW will be slowly sold for WETH using a programmatic order. The WETH collected, plus 139 WETH already in the DAO treasury, together with the remaining COW will be used as liquidity in a Function Maximizing AMM (FM-AMM): a new type of AMM accessible only by solvers trading via the CoW Protocol settlement contract. [Recent work of one of the authors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.02074)  shows that FM-AMM has unique benefits because it eliminates LVR (the excess profits arbitrageurs earn at the expense of LP in a regular AMM) and sandwich attacks, which are currently responsible for the vast majority of MEV on Ethereum. From the DAO’s viewpoint, contributing liquidity to an FM-AMM is equivalent to running a passive investment strategy, which can be helpful for treasury management.\n\n### Motivation\nThe lack of liquidity in the markets for COW deters potential investors, who may be concerned about price volatility and price impact if they need to sell their COW. To address this concern, we propose to:\n- use the programmatic order framework to slowly sell COW for WETH at market price \n- use the WETH acquired together with additional COW to seed a function maximizing AMM (or FM-AMM, see [research paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.02074) ), which will then continuously supply liquidity to the COW/WETH market. \n\nAccording to the cited research, contributing liquidity to an FM-AMM is equivalent to running a passive investment strategy: an FM-AMM automatically trades to allocate half of the portfolio’s value to each asset (any other sharing rule can also be implemented). Passive investment strategies are the most common strategy to reduce risks and are the dominant way to invest in traditional financial assets. For example, [more than 50% of US shares are held by ETFs implementing passive investment strategies](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-09-11/passive-u-s-equity-funds-eclipse-active-in-epic-industry-shift). Therefore, an additional benefit of this scheme is that it introduces an automatic treasury management solution for the CoW DAO. Finally, if successful, the scheme can also serve as a template for other DAOs that may need to provide liquidity for their token while automatically managing their treasury.\n\nThis proposal aims to test the mechanism at a reasonable scale. If the test is successful,  additional funds might be requested to scale further.\n\n\n### Specification\nWe propose that the DAO allocates 6M COW to the Treasury Safe which will then be redirected to a dedicated Safe (“CoWAMM Safe”), together with 139 WETH from the wstETH / GNO pool (counteracted by raising validators with idle GNO that can increase yield).\n\nUsing a programmatic order, every day, the Funding Safe creates a market order to sell 20,000 COW for WETH on behalf of the DAO. The proceeds are forwarded to the safe charged with running the FM-AMM (“CoWAMM Safe”). As soon as the order is executed, 20,000 COW are also forwarded to the FM-AMM. The purpose of the programmatic order is to slowly increase the liquidity in the FM-AMM, so as to test its functioning. As soon as the FM-AMM is determined as sound (also depending on other factors such as the outcome of an audit), the DAO will transfer 139 WETH together with an amount of COW of equal value. Overall, we expect the programmatic order to sell around 2.5M COW over a period of 4 months. \n\nFM-AMM will start contributing liquidity to the CoW Protocol batch auctions as soon as its TVL is sufficiently large. With respect to its technical implementation, initially, we plan to follow a prototype available [here](https://gnosisscan.io/address/0x6f6a01aed93606fa9ade7d087f31a6f1b29aac9e#code). In it, the smart contract pulls the price of COW from an oracle and then chooses the amount x of COW to sell by solving\n\nmax_x {(X-x)(Y+px)},\n\nwhere p is the price of COW in ETH (from the oracle), and X and Y are the FM-AMM reserves in COW and WETH, respectively. The FM-AMM then creates a market order to sell x COW (or sell px WETH). Solver competition then determines the price at which this order is executed.\n\nThis implementation does not require any change for CoW Protocol or for solvers. However, it implicitly assumes that the liquidity in the FM-AMM is small relative to the market, and hence the oracle price is a good estimation of the price in the solver competition. But if the FM-AMM is large, then its decision to trade will have an impact on the COW price. Hence, the price before FM-AMM trades (as determined by the oracle) may be very different from the price determined contextually to FM-AMM trading (as determined in the solvers’ competition).\n\nA more sophisticated implementation can eliminate the dependency on the oracle, by asking solvers to propose a sell amount x and a buy amount y (both of which can be negative) for FM-AMM. The winning solver is the one providing more surplus to the FM-AMM, where surplus here is calculated as:\n\n(X-x)(Y+y) - XY.\n\nWe note that already now, certain order types require solvers to specify both sell and buy amounts (e.g., partially fillable limit orders). Hence, the above implementation differs from the already supported order types primarily in the way surplus is calculated. We believe it can be easily included in our current infrastructure, but the exact details will be determined at a later stage.\n\n### Transaction\n- Transfer 6M COW from CoW DAO (eth:0xcA771eda0c70aA7d053aB1B25004559B918FE662) to the Treasury Safe (eth:0x616dE58c011F8736fa20c7Ae5352F7f6FB9F0669)\n- Mandate the Core team to launch two Safes, owned by the CoW DAO Safe and Treasury Safe with a threshold of 1/2,\n    - Funding Safe\n    - CoWAMM Safe\n- Mandate the Treasury team to redirect 139 WETH and the equivalent in COW from the DAO treasury positions to the CoWAMM Safe, in a maximum of two months.",

Moreover, for the past 6 months, and after CIP-27 was introduced, multiple solvers have also become so-called “price estimators” for the protocol, and compete to provide the best possible quotes, accessible via the API to multiple integrators (e.g., CoW Swap, DefiLlama), so as to attract as much orderflow as possible. Overall, the solver competition over the past several months has seen great advancements, with solvers becoming very reliable and competent, providing very robust quotes, doing private market making and striving to improve their view of the available onchain liquidity, as well as taking advantage of the structural benefits of batching. All these are largely due to the solver rewards that solvers receive in COW.\n\nThis proposal aims to ensure appropriate funding to continue rewarding solvers and hence supporting a competitive solver landscape, with the goal to establish a state-of-the-art diverse collection of solvers running on CoW Protocol and executing the users’ trading intents in the best possible way, while taking full advantage of the unique feature of CoW Protocol, namely batching of trades.\n\nAs already mentioned, the projected estimate of CIP-29 proved to be very accurate, lasting for 6 months. However, one should observe that in the past several weeks, the rewards given in the price estimation competition have exceeded the estimated average of 77k COW per week. For specific data on this, see the relevant [forum post](https://forum.cow.fi/t/cip-draft-adjusting-and-renewing-solver-rewards-budget/2244#motivation-2). The data indicate increased orderflow to the protocol, which is a very positive development, but on the other hand, it shows that if the protocol continues to increase its market share and the number of orders it executes on a weekly basis, the DAO would end up spending more than the average of 77k COW per week for quote rewards. Concretely, for these past 6 weeks, the average quote rewards per week were 103,573 COW, which is 26,573 more COW compared to the original estimate. On top of that, the COW token price (measured in USD) has consistently been about three times as much (or even more) as it was at the time CIP-27 passed.\n\nFor the above reasons, we propose to decrease the per order quote reward from 9 COW down to 6 COW, but also introduce a cap of 0.0006 ETH per quote reward. Concretely, this would mean that a quote would be rewarded with an amount equal to\n\nquote_reward = min{0.0006 ETH, 6 COW},\n\nwhere the comparison of the 0.0006 ETH to the 6 COW would be based on the market prices at the day of the weekly payout.\n\nSince we are optimistic that COW will continue to perform strongly, we also propose to adjust the solver competition rewards. As a reminder, the soft budget on solver competition rewards, that splits into performance and consistency rewards, is specified in COW and is currently set to 306,645 COW per week. However, the performance rewards are specified in ETH and have an ETH-denominated cap (but are paid in COW). This means that the value of the consistency rewards in ETH fluctuates with the price of COW. As a consequence, when the price of COW relative to ETH increases, solvers are mainly rewarded for consistency and not for their performance in the competition. Since the recent COW price increase, we have indeed observed that the performance rewards have decreased, implying that the consistency (aka participation) rewards have increased. As we believe that performance rewards provide very strong drive for solvers to keep improving their executions, we propose to increase the upper cap of 0.01 ETH, enforced on a per settlement basis as specified in CIP-20, and make it 0.012 ETH, while keeping the lower cap of -0.01 ETH; this effectively makes the cap asymmetric. The reason for not decreasing the lower cap symmetrically is mainly that solvers still do not fully own the submission process, and, since the main goal here is to increase performance rewards, we believe this is a reasonable compromise (until the protocol reaches a future more decentralized phase where solvers own and control their submissions and thus can be held fully accountable for reverts/cancellations). In combination with this, we propose to make the (soft) budget on the solver competition equal to 250k COW, instead of the 306,645 COW that has been until today. This budget is soft in the sense that the mechanism computes performance rewards by ignoring this budget, and only in the case where performance rewards during a week are lower than that budget, it then distributes the remaining budget as consistency rewards to solvers. Given the data on the past 6 weeks, the increase in performance rewards with this change would be at most 20%, which shows that in most weeks there would still be some budget left for consistency rewards. Specifically, there would be, on average, at least 40k COW remaining to be distributed as consistency rewards. Finally, to ensure that the protocol does not overspend on consistency rewards in cases where the COW token significantly overperforms ETH, we further propose to add an absolute cap of 6 ETH on the total amount of consistency rewards that are distributed on a weekly basis. This means that we would have\n\nconsistency rewards = max{0, min{250k - performance rewards (in COW), 6 ETH}}.\n\nThis amount of 6 ETH currently corresponds to ~50k COW, and is still significantly larger than what CIP-20 intended as rewards for consistency rewards; as a reminder, the goal of CIP-20 was that around 25% of the budget at the time was given as consistency rewards, which corresponded to around 95k COW when the evaluation of COW was around $0.08 and ETH was around $1,500.\n\nTo summarize, we propose the following changes:\n\n- We aim for a weekly rewards budget of 300k-310k COW, which is a reduction of roughly 20% compared to the budget of 383,307 COW that CIP-20 specified. For this reason, we ask the DAO for 8M COW for the next 6 months, estimated to last from Tuesday, February 6, 2024 until Tuesday, July 30, 2024.\n\n- The quote reward per order is defined as min{0.0006 ETH, 6 COW}.\n\n- The upper cap on performance rewards per settlement is increased from 0.01 ETH to 0.012 ETH, while the lower cap remains the same and equal to -0.01 ETH.\n\nThe weekly soft budget on performance and consistency rewards is reduced from 306,307 COW to 250,000 COW, and moreover, there is an absolute cap of 6 ETH applied to the total amount of consistency rewards distributed.\n\nAs with previous related CIPs, it is important to note that this budgeting proposal is independent of additional proposals to potentially change the solver reward structure, which can be configured for appropriate spending according to the budget.\n\n## Specification\nTransfer 8M COW from CoW DAO (0xca771eda0c70aa7d053ab1b25004559b918fe662) to the Solver Rewards safe (0xA03be496e67Ec29bC62F01a428683D7F9c204930)\n\n## Rationale\nSolver rewards are planned to continue using the same operational structure, carried out from the solver rewards safe. ETH for compensating gas execution costs is estimated to be fully covered by collecting fees from users. It is proposed to allocate 8M COW tokens for a 6 month period of rewards. This represents a yearly budget of 16M COW tokens, 1.6% of the COW token supply, valued at $6,147,200 according to current market price.",

      "content": "```\nCIP: 35\ntitle: Renewing the CoW Grants Program\nauthor: @middleway.eth, @Kubesqrt, @notsoformal, @Chim9, @Master_CoW, @mfw78, @fairlight \nstatus: Active\ncreated: 2023-01-04\n```\n\n## Simple Summary\n\nOver the past 12 months, CoW Protocol and the Grants Committee have seen substantial progress, successfully approving and implementing several impactful grants. These initiatives have strengthened our integration with prominent DeFi platforms and furthered CoW Protocol's features.\n\nThe CoW Grants Program, whose first renewal occurred in January 2023 under CIP-18, has proven to be a vital component in advancing CoW Protocol. As we approach the end of CIP-18 term, we would like to propose extending the program. We're reaching out to the community for support to renew the CoW Grants Program for another 12 months, aiming to continue supporting grants that grow CoW Protocol.\n\n## Motivation\n### Past Grants\n\nThe CoW Grants Program has been actively supporting the growth of CoW Protocol, reviewing and funding a variety of applications over the past year. These projects have made significant contributions in different areas, enhancing the overall functionality and reach of the protocol.\n\nBelow are some of the impactful contributions funded in 2023:\n\n-   **Safe Composable Conditional Orders**: Significantly enhanced CoW Swap's functionality by allowing developers and integrators to create their own custom orders with unique conditions that get enforced onchain. This contribution enabled the launch of the \"Programmatic Orders'' framework.\n\n-   **Dump.services**: Streamlined the process of consolidating multiple tokens into a single asset, making portfolio management simpler and more efficient.\n\n-   **Balancer and CoW Swap Integration Bounty**: Played a key role in strengthening the integration between Balancer and CoW Swap. This grant focused on encouraging solvers to integrate the fee discount mechanism into their solver infrastructure.\n\n-   **CoW DeFi Hook Interface**: Currently under development, this initiative aims to make CoW Protocol services that are based on hooks more user-friendly and widely accessible, enhancing the overall user experience.\n\n-   **Composable CoW Framework Treasure Hunt**: Introduced by MasterCow, this unique approach engages the community through a treasure hunt, fostering interaction and creativity in exploring the Composable CoW Framework.\n\n-   **Core contributors**: At the time of writing there are three full time core contributors funded by the CoW Grants program: Content writer, Backend developer, Designer. Their contributions are ongoing and invaluable. These costs account for 272k xDAI from the yearly Grants program budget.\n\n### Volume rewards program\n\nOver the past 12 months, the CoW Grants Program successfully implemented the Volume-based Partner Reward Program, initially introduced with the Shapeshift Integration Grant. This program aligns incentives for partners by offering rewards based on actual performance, measured in terms of the trading volume they drive to CoW Protocol.\n\nThe grants committee has approved 8 applications related to this program, two of them during December. Three applications achieved milestones and therefore became eligible for rewards. \n\nIn aggregate the program rewarded 550k COW vested linearly over 12 months across 3 eligible partners based on $910M worth of added trading volume. The main contributor being DeFi Llama with all three volume milestones achieved. \n\nBesides incentivizing higher volumes, the program also provides partners with exposure to the COW token, fostering a mutually beneficial relationship between CoW DAO and its integrators.\n\nMore information about grants can be found at:\n\n- [Grants Program forum section](https://forum.cow.fi/c/cow-grants-program/10)\n- [Grant Status Tracker](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qnAegZR-JCKEAqeUHO4Gs8uQoLn2KO_f3xfAe0WhePM/edit?usp=sharing)\n- [Grants Program Snapshot space](https://snapshot.org/#/cowgrants.eth)\n\n## Grant program financial position\n\nAs we approach the end of the current term, here's a summary of the CoW Grants Committee's financial commitments and disbursements (excluding the January monthly payment):\n![Financial position](ipfs://bafkreiatpqojgc6zqbsnchy3u4ouqeps7gqubatrwvdutcsut44bpwbs3e)\n    \n-   **Payouts Completed**: So far, the Grants DAO has distributed a total of 499k XDAI and 1.2M COW, of which 530k was for the Volume program.\n-   **Total Commitments**: The Committee has committed 615k XDAI and over 4M COW to various projects and initiatives. These commitments account for 55.92% of the XDAI budget and 80.54% of the COW budget.\n-   **Volume-Based Grants**: Of the 3,000,000 COW allocated for volume-based grants, 88% has been committed. To date, two bounties have met the criteria and are eligible for payout under this category.\n\n## CoW Grants Committee Structure and Operations\n\n### Committee Members\n\nThe current CoW Grants Committee, consisting of seven members (three from the core team and four from the community) is structured as a Gnosis Safe with 5/7 quorum for approving grants.\n\n### Compensation for community committee members\n\nThe stipend structure for the community members of the Grant Committee defined in CIP-18 is 8,000 COW plus an additional $150 in $XDAI monthly. This arrangement was designed to compensate the committee members appropriately, taking into account their responsibilities and the variable value of $COW.\n\nAs the COW token price increased, it is proposed to add a quarterly cap adjustment for the COW compensation component to $1k worth.\nFor Q1 2024:\n-   4400 COW (Calculation: $1k / 0.23, will be revised quarterly)\n-   150 xDAI\n\n### Proposing new committee member for nomination \n\nRecognizing the increasing scope of work, the committee advocates for adding an eighth member, making the approval quorum 5/8. This addition aims to distribute the workload more effectively and enhance the committee's capacity for thorough grant management and decision-making.\n\n[Brett](https://twitter.com/sohkai) is an active technical contributor to the Ethereum ecosystem who currently co-leads Cherry Crypto. Brett is also active committee member at the Safe Grants Program, and has proven his contribution to the CoW team over the years. We propose to nominate Brett for a technical committee member seat. More information about Brett can be found in a comment down below, together with the specified address to be added to the Grants Committee Safe.\n\n## Specification\n\n### Budget\n\nFor the upcoming term, we propose the following funding structure:\n\n1.  **700k xDAI, on top of remaining funds in the Grants Safe** (executed by the Treasury team on demand)\n    a.  An increased amount given the number of Core Contributors which are associated with the Program.\n    b. Paid quarterly or on demand to the Treasury Core Team.\n    c. Sources to be funded from the Treasury Operation.\n\n2.  **1M COW, on top of remaining funds in the Grants Safe** (executed by CoW DAO using the attached payload)\n    a. Given that current commitments are expected to exceed the current CoW remaining balance.\n    b. Paid once at renewal of the Program from the [CoW DAO safe](https://app.safe.global/home?safe=eth:0xcA771eda0c70aA7d053aB1B25004559B918FE662)\n\n3.  **Up to 3M CoW allocation for the Volume Program**  (executed by CoW DAO using the attached payload)\n    a.

      "content": "```\nCIP: 35\ntitle: Renewing the CoW Grants Program\nauthor: @middleway.eth, @Kubesqrt, @notsoformal, @Chim9, @Master_CoW, @mfw78, @fairlight \nstatus: Active\ncreated: 2023-01-04\n```\n\n## Simple Summary\n\nOver the past 12 months, CoW Protocol and the Grants Committee have seen substantial progress, successfully approving and implementing several impactful grants. These initiatives have strengthened our integration with prominent DeFi platforms and furthered CoW Protocol's features.\n\nThe CoW Grants Program, whose first renewal occurred in January 2023 under CIP-18, has proven to be a vital component in advancing CoW Protocol. As we approach the end of CIP-18 term, we would like to propose extending the program. We're reaching out to the community for support to renew the CoW Grants Program for another 12 months, aiming to continue supporting grants that grow CoW Protocol.\n\n## Motivation\n### Past Grants\n\nThe CoW Grants Program has been actively supporting the growth of CoW Protocol, reviewing and funding a variety of applications over the past year. These projects have made significant contributions in different areas, enhancing the overall functionality and reach of the protocol.\n\nBelow are some of the impactful contributions funded in 2023:\n\n-   **Safe Composable Conditional Orders**: Significantly enhanced CoW Swap's functionality by allowing developers and integrators to create their own custom orders with unique conditions that get enforced onchain. This contribution enabled the launch of the \"Programmatic Orders'' framework.\n\n-   **Dump.services**: Streamlined the process of consolidating multiple tokens into a single asset, making portfolio management simpler and more efficient.\n\n-   **Balancer and CoW Swap Integration Bounty**: Played a key role in strengthening the integration between Balancer and CoW Swap. This grant focused on encouraging solvers to integrate the fee discount mechanism into their solver infrastructure.\n\n-   **CoW DeFi Hook Interface**: Currently under development, this initiative aims to make CoW Protocol services that are based on hooks more user-friendly and widely accessible, enhancing the overall user experience.\n\n-   **Composable CoW Framework Treasure Hunt**: Introduced by MasterCow, this unique approach engages the community through a treasure hunt, fostering interaction and creativity in exploring the Composable CoW Framework.\n\n-   **Core contributors**: At the time of writing there are three full time core contributors funded by the CoW Grants program: Content writer, Backend developer, Designer. Their contributions are ongoing and invaluable. These costs account for 272k xDAI from the yearly Grants program budget.\n\n### Volume rewards program\n\nOver the past 12 months, the CoW Grants Program successfully implemented the Volume-based Partner Reward Program, initially introduced with the Shapeshift Integration Grant. This program aligns incentives for partners by offering rewards based on actual performance, measured in terms of the trading volume they drive to CoW Protocol.\n\nThe grants committee has approved 8 applications related to this program, two of them during December. Three applications achieved milestones and therefore became eligible for rewards. \n\nIn aggregate the program rewarded 550k COW vested linearly over 12 months across 3 eligible partners based on $910M worth of added trading volume. The main contributor being DeFi Llama with all three volume milestones achieved. \n\nBesides incentivizing higher volumes, the program also provides partners with exposure to the COW token, fostering a mutually beneficial relationship between CoW DAO and its integrators.\n\nMore information about grants can be found at:\n\n- [Grants Program forum section](https://forum.cow.fi/c/cow-grants-program/10)\n- [Grant Status Tracker](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qnAegZR-JCKEAqeUHO4Gs8uQoLn2KO_f3xfAe0WhePM/edit?usp=sharing)\n- [Grants Program Snapshot space](https://snapshot.org/#/cowgrants.eth)\n\n## Grant program financial position\n\nAs we approach the end of the current term, here's a summary of the CoW Grants Committee's financial commitments and disbursements (excluding the January monthly payment):\n![Financial position](ipfs://bafkreiatpqojgc6zqbsnchy3u4ouqeps7gqubatrwvdutcsut44bpwbs3e)\n\n-   **Payouts Completed**: So far, the Grants DAO has distributed a total of 499k XDAI and 1.2M COW, of which 530k was for the Volume program.\n-   **Total Commitments**: The Committee has committed 615k XDAI and over 4M COW to various projects and initiatives. These commitments account for 55.92% of the XDAI budget and 80.54% of the COW budget.\n-   **Volume-Based Grants**: Of the 3,000,000 COW allocated for volume-based grants, 88% has been committed. To date, two bounties have met the criteria and are eligible for payout under this category.\n\n## CoW Grants Committee Structure and Operations\n\n### Committee Members\n\nThe current CoW Grants Committee, consisting of seven members (three from the core team and four from the community) is structured as a Gnosis Safe with 5/7 quorum for approving grants.\n\n### Compensation for community committee members\n\nThe stipend structure for the community members of the Grant Committee defined in CIP-18 is 8,000 COW plus an additional $150 in $XDAI monthly. This arrangement was designed to compensate the committee members appropriately, taking into account their responsibilities and the variable value of $COW.\n\nAs the COW token price increased, it is proposed to add a quarterly cap adjustment for the COW compensation component to $1k worth.\nFor Q1 2024:\n-   4400 COW (Calculation: $1k / 0.23, will be revised quarterly)\n-   150 xDAI\n\n### Proposing new committee member for nomination \n\nRecognizing the increasing scope of work, the committee advocates for adding an eighth member, making the approval quorum 5/8. This addition aims to distribute the workload more effectively and enhance the committee's capacity for thorough grant management and decision-making.\n\n[Brett](https://twitter.com/sohkai) is an active technical contributor to the Ethereum ecosystem who currently co-leads Cherry Crypto. Brett is also active committee member at the Safe Grants Program, and has proven his contribution to the CoW team over the years. We propose to nominate Brett for a technical committee member seat. More information about Brett can be found in a comment down below, together with the specified address to be added to the Grants Committee Safe.\n\n## Specification\n\n### Budget\n\nFor the upcoming term, we propose the following funding structure:\n\n1.  **700k xDAI, on top of remaining funds in the Grants Safe** (executed by the Treasury team on demand)\n    a.  An increased amount given the number of Core Contributors which are associated with the Program.\n    b. Paid quarterly or on demand to the Treasury Core Team.\n    c. Sources to be funded from the Treasury Operation.\n\n2.  **1M COW, on top of remaining funds in the Grants Safe** (executed by CoW DAO using the attached payload)\n    a. Given that current commitments are expected to exceed the current CoW remaining balance.\n    b. Paid once at renewal of the Program from the [CoW DAO safe](https://app.safe.global/home?safe=eth:0xcA771eda0c70aA7d053aB1B25004559B918FE662)\n\n3.  **Up to 3M CoW allocation for the Volume Program**  (executed by CoW DAO using the attached payload)\n    a.  Giving mandate to the Grants DAO to commit up to a total of 3M CoW extra to the current allocation.\n\n4. A new community committee member will be added to the Committee Safe with the address [`0x57C2570F1a4228a3aEff4fE533826C2A04a2D52f`](https://gnosisscan.io/address/0x57C2570F1a4228a3aEff4fE533826C2A04a2D52f), ([brettsun.eth](https://app.ens.domains/brettsun.eth)) - Will be executed by the Grants Committee upon approval of this proposal. \n\n### Grants Program Duration\n\nThe CoW Grants Program continues on a rolling 12-month term, up to Jan '25, subject to yearly reviews and renewals by CoW DAO.

      "title": "CIP-34: Testing Fee Models for CoW Protocol",
      "content": "```\nCIP: 34\nTitle: Support MEV Blocker with 30K monthly funding over 6 months \nAuthor: @marshy\nStatus: Active\nCreated: 2024-01-09\n```\n\n## Summary\n\nThis proposal asks whether CoW DAO should embark on a 6-month period to test promising fee models for the purpose of generating revenue from CoW Protocol.\n\n## Motivation\n\nOne of CoW DAO’s long-held objectives for CoW Protocol is to make sure that it is financially self-sustainable, so it does not rely on external funding for growth or development. To achieve sustainability in the long term, CoW Protocol must start experimenting with generating revenue in the short term.\n\nThe fees that CoW Protocol charges today are estimated to cover gas costs alone; they are collected by the protocol and remitted to solvers. Most revenue kept by CoW DAO to-date is from over-collecting gas fees. This is neither intentional nor desirable (as users occasionally overpay for transaction costs), and it is likely to be addressed by updates to the rules of the solver competition.\n\nRather than rely on unintentional and unpredictable revenue, CoW Protocol should develop revenue streams that are reliable and sustainable.\n\nFortunately, CoW Protocol is in a unique position to implement fee models that are incentive-aligned with its users. CoW Protocol leverages intents and uses batch auctions as its price finding mechanism. This allows the protocol to generate surplus and improve prices for its users – in other words, to give them more than they asked for. Taking a fee from this price improvement is one example of a model that is incentive-aligned with users and uniquely achievable by CoW Protocol.\n\nCharging fees can, of course, be controversial. And it is possible that implementing new fees will have a negative impact on user behavior. It is therefore a good idea to focus attention on fee models based on added value (i.e. where CoW Protocol takes fees from the savings it creates for users) and to test and monitor the impact of various fee models before settling on a long-term solution.\n\n## Specification\n\nThe core team proposes that CoW DAO embarks on a 6-month testing period to collect data that will inform CoW Protocol’s long-term fee model.\n\nIn that time, CoW Protocol may test the following fee models:\n\n- **Quote improvement fees:** charging a fee on the “extra” amount received by a trader, thanks to the performance of CoW Protocol\n- **Surplus fees:** charging a fee on surplus (surplus = amount received - quoted amount - slippage) for order types that competing platforms cannot generate a surplus from (e.g. dutch-auction-based models cannot generate surplus for out-of-market limit orders)\n- **Volume-based fees:** charging a small % (such as one basis point) on the total trade amount of certain token pairs (i.e. not stable-to-stable trades) can be rather lucrative, though less incentive-aligned\n- **Fixed fees:** charging a fixed amount for every trade\n- Any new idea for a fee model that presents itself during the testing period\n\nWithin the scope of this proposal, the core team should test a range of options regarding fee percentages, caps, and volume-based tiers, while closely monitoring market share, retention rate, and other relevant user metrics. They should start by testing the models expected to have the least negative impact on user behavior.\n\nConsistent with CoW DAOs structure and values, fees should always accumulate to CoW DAO and be applied in the ecosystem to the benefit of the DAO through future CIPs. Implementation and communication of the fee mechanics will be performed by the core team, who will also maintain a public notice of current fees on cow.fi 7. The core team will also provide updates, periodically, on the results of the fee model testing.\n\n## Rationale\n\nAdditional revenue can be used for multiple purposes: to accelerate the development of CoW Protocol, to acquire new users, to fund token utility, and more. Ultimately, the goal is to make CoW Protocol self-sustainable.\n\nTaking a test-and-learn approach is essential to maximizing the positive impact of new fee models. Passing one CIP to cover 6 months of testing allows the team to move fast and nimbly. Needing to pass a new CIP for each new test would be unnecessarily restrictive.\n\n## Execution\n\nIf this CIP passes, the core team will begin testing fee models immediately and keep COW token holders updated on learnings periodically.\n\nFees will accrue to a new Safe that is created for the purpose of revenue model testing. The Safe will belong to CoW DAO be operated by the treasury team with a threshold of 1/2.\n \n![Screenshot 2024-01-09 at 3.50.46 PM.png](ipfs://bafkreigc6rizixiclctb4mwklv66jrimccymxkqpyfwj2n5pbyvf76pony)\n\nThank you.",

This proposal seeks to enhance operational efficiency and fund utilization, ensuring the DAO optimally utilizes capital and fosters further income generation. It’s important to acknowledge that these funds can be reverted to the CoW DAO when needed, adhering to the considerations outlined in CIP-28.\n\n## Specification\nThat the CoW DAO adds the Treasury Core Unit Safe eth:0x616dE58c011F8736fa20c7Ae5352F7f6FB9F0669 as an owner of the MEV Blocker Rebates Safe eth:0xCe91228789B57DEb45e66Ca10Ff648385fE7093b, with a threshold of 1/2.\nThat the Treasury Core Unit periodically redirects the accumulated MEV Blocker rebates to the Treasury Core Unit Safe.\nRationale\nThis proposal aims to streamline operations and enhance the efficiency of fund flow and utilisation, ensuring the DAO maximises capital utilisation and generates further income. By empowering the Treasury Core unit with more direct interaction and management of the rebates, we aim to improve the workflow, all while alleviating the necessity for the DAO to engage in frequent, meticulous oversight once rebate thresholds are reached.\n\nAdditionally, The Treasury Core Unit pertains to requesting DAO authorisation to, if relevant, in the future, implement a TWAP order (updating the MEV Blocker Rebates Safe fallback handler) to automatise the process of redirecting balance to the treasury operation.\n\n## Safe Transaction Data\nAdd owner with threshold\nSend ETH\n\n```\n{\n  \"version\": \"1.0\",\n  \"chainId\": \"1\",\n  \"createdAt\": 1697647344290,\n  \"meta\": {\n    \"name\": \"Transactions Batch\",\n    \"description\": \"\",\n    \"txBuilderVersion\": \"1.16.3\",\n    \"createdFromSafeAddress\": \"0xCe91228789B57DEb45e66Ca10Ff648385fE7093b\",\n    \"createdFromOwnerAddress\": \"\",\n    \"checksum\": \"0xc3d236641b5959d3103f5100d02b51e35c996f43a819a087d3916bd2a0f604a9\"\n  },\n  \"transactions\": [\n    {\n      \"to\": \"0x616dE58c011F8736fa20c7Ae5352F7f6FB9F0669\",\n      \"value\": \"97000000000000000000\",\n      \"data\": null,\n      \"contractMethod\": {\n        \"inputs\": [],\n        \"name\": \"fallback\",\n        \"payable\": true\n      },\n      \"contractInputsValues\": null\n    },\n    {\n      \"to\": \"0xCe91228789B57DEb45e66Ca10Ff648385fE7093b\",\n      \"value\": \"0\",\n      \"data\": null,\n      \"contractMethod\": {\n        \"inputs\": [\n          {\n            \"internalType\": \"address\",\n            \"name\": \"owner\",\n            \"type\": \"address\"\n          },\n          {\n            \"internalType\": \"uint256\",\n            \"name\": \"_threshold\",\n            \"type\": \"uint256\"\n          }\n        ],\n        \"name\": \"addOwnerWithThreshold\",\n        \"payable\": false\n      },\n      \"contractInputsValues\": {\n        \"owner\": \"0x616dE58c011F8736fa20c7Ae5352F7f6FB9F0669\",\n        \"_threshold\": \"1\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

      "content": "```\nCIP: 32\ntitle: Support MEV Blocker with 30K monthly funding over 6 months \nauthor: @c3rnst \nstatus: Active\ncreated: 2023-10-06\n```\n\n## Simple Summary\n\nMEV Blocker is a CoW DAO affiliated project, in collaboration with GnosisDAO and Beaverbuild.\n\nSince its launch, MEV Blocker has been successful and now accounts for 5-6% of all Ethereum transactions (cf. Dune dashboard [here](https://dune.com/cowprotocol/mev-blocker), query [here](https://dune.com/queries/2441751/4012505) ). To ensure MEV Blocker maintains its position as one of the market leaders and expand its reach, it is proposed to increase the resources spent on MEV Blocker.\n\nWith this proposal, the service provider Nomev Labs asks for a regular monthly payment of 30k USD in USDC starting 1 October 2023, for a time period of 6 months (up to and including March 2024) to support MEV Blocker with additional marketing, business development, and engineering resources, where needed.\n\n## Motivation\n\nBackground on the motivation for building MEV Blocker can be found in @fleupold’s [forum post](https://forum.cow.fi/t/utilization-of-mev-blocker-kickbacks-from-cow-settlements/1652) on MEV Blocker kickbacks. To summarize:\n\nThe MEV Blocker RPC endpoint was designed to complement CoW Protocol’s MEV protection for trades and protect users in a wider sense:\n\n“While MEV Blocker achieves a very good level of protection from MEV, we mainly built it as a complement to CoW Swap for transaction intents that are not yet supported by the protocol (e.g. providing liquidity, NFT trades, etc…) and as a stepping stone for integrations.\n\n“Moreover, CoW Protocol itself can use MEV Blocker’s infrastructure to benefit CoW Protocol solvers and therefore also CoW Swap users.”\n\nMEV Blocker is an important, constituent part of the suite of MEV-protective products that CoW DAO offers to Ethereum users and therefore should receive dedicated resources.\n\n## Specification\n\nTo date, Nomev Labs has asked for funding as part of two Service Agreements (cf. [CIP-6](https://forum.cow.fi/t/cip-6-funding-for-development-services-service-agreement/574) and [CIP-24](https://forum.cow.fi/t/cip-24-continued-funding-for-development-services-service-agreement-no-2/1531)), with each allocating 6M USDC to the development of the CoW Suite. These funds came out of the USDC raised and set aside by CoW DAO for the provision of development services.\n\nWe are now asking for a separate stream of continuous funding to support MEV Blocker for the next 6 months.\n\nThese funds would come from funds that CoW DAO holds within the treasury. Currently, the treasury accumulates a surplus of an average monthly 62k USDC (roughly, depending on the ETH price). Further profit-generating streams for CoW DAO can and should be discussed separately.\n\n\n## Scope of Services \n\nAt this time, Nomev Labs would like CoW DAO’s support to continue dedicating significant efforts to MEV Blocker. While also including Services that have not been in scope so far, the scope of Services that can be mandated within this CIP, are:\n\n### Services\n- Continuous improvement of the user experience\n- Fostering collaborations and partnerships, especially business development for MEV Blocker integrations\n- Hosting relevant interfaces such as mevblocker.io on behalf of CoW DAO\n- Assisting in the promotion of the product, including at and for conferences and with promotional materials\n- Any other assistance and advice that may be provided by the team’s expertise, e.g. software engineering, graphical design as well as relevant project management and accounting services\n- Data analysis and engineering\n- Integration engineering\n- Project coordination and facilitating profit generation discussion\n- Any other adjacent services to ensure the smooth running of the product, including but not limited to:\n   - Potential Grant proposal vetting\n   - Effective outsourcing to specialists and external parties.\n   - Ensuring system security, providing development operations and security personnel.\n   - Per need, driving bug bounties (to be settled via CoW DAO)\n\n## Funding request and payment terms\n\nWe are asking for 30k USD equivalent in USDC or other stablecoins, including EUR denominated stablecoins, to be contributed per month, commencing 1 October 2023, for a period of 6 months (up to and including March 2024).\n\nThis total funding amount of 180k USD will go to support 3 full-time equivalent resources.\n\nThe funds can be terminated by means of the successful passing of a proposal from CoW DAO at any point in time.\n\nA potential renewal for continuous funding is not automatic and would be proposal-based.\n\n## Execution\n\nSafe Transaction Data:\n\nWith the generation from and re-direction of CoW DAO profits to the treasury team, the proposal suggests that the treasury team streams monthly funds to eth:0x42eAF3a4264be73f3Dc96a85990fa283f3CbCbc5\n\n## II Terms\n\nPayment terms\n- With the successful passing of the proposal, CoW DAO agrees to a monthly payment of the fee, which is not subject to additional invoices.\n- The payment should be made at least 30 days after the last day of the relevant month for which Services are performed (e.g. for October payment, by 30. November).\n- No detailed time report will need to be provided.\n\nTermination\n- The ongoing Services can be terminated via a proposal and successful voting of CoW DAO (which takes roughly 2 weeks).\n- Nomev Labs is entitled to end its Services with a 2-week notice via publication in the Forum.\n- Payment is expected for the time in which Services were rendered (until a valid termination and 2 week notice period).\n\nIntellectual Property\n- All rights related to works, new products and processes, or correction or improvement of products or processes already existing in the scope of the Services/MEV Blocker, in addition to works, inventions or creations, designs or models, trademarks, trade names, logos, software, databases, domain names or other materials and know-how (including trade secrets), whether registered or not, and regardless of their patentability, registrability or fixation, that Nomev Labs, individually or jointly, has created or whose creation has provided during the Services to provide services that relate, directly or indirectly, to the business of CoW DAO, (hereinafter, “Intellectual Property”), belong by origin and since their creation to CoW DAO in accordance with the CoW DAO’s Participation Agreement (the “Participation Agreement”).\n- This effect occurs when the Intellectual Property is generated during the provision of Services by Nomev Labs, regardless of whether or not the creation, or the cause of the creation, of the Intellectual Property is, wholly or partially, directly or through a third party.\n\nMiscellaneous (in no particular order)\n\n- Profit. The company strives to incur a profit. Profits are envisaged to be reinvested into the company, in line with CoW DAO’s vision of a decentralised future and mission of enhancing the MEV-Protection products.\n- Subcontracting. The Company may subcontract any portion of the Services to be performed under these Services (if passed successfully).\n- Assignment. Nomev Labs may at any time assign, mortgage, charge, subcontract, delegate, declare a trust over or deal in any other manner with any or all of its rights and obligations under this CIP (if passed successfully).\n- Confidentiality: All information obtained privately (i.e. not via public discourse, such as blockchain transactions or on the CoW DAO Forum) shall remain the sole and exclusive property of the discloser (including CoW DAO and Nomev Labs members).\n- Definitions. Terms in this CIP (if passed successfully) shall have the same meaning as in the Participation Agreement. In the event of any conflict or inconsistency between this CIP and the terms of the Participation Agreement, this CIP shall take priority as between them to the extent that is necessary to resolve the conflict or inconsistency.\n- Affiliate. Nomev Labs is a Service Provider to CoW DAO, not a member or affiliate. Nothing in this proposal and no action taken by the Nomev Labs or CoW DAO pursuant to this proposal shall constitute, or be deemed to constitute, a partnership, association, joint venture or other co-operative entity between any of the parties…\n- Disclaimer. CoW DAO and Nomev Labs expressly disclaim all representations, warranties, guarantees, conditions and undertakings, including warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose.\n- Limitation of liability. Nomev Labs’s total aggregate liability for all and any claims arising under or in connection with this CIP (if passed successfully), regardless of form of action and whether in contract, tort, warranty, or other legal or equitable grounds (including in each case negligence), shall be limited to a maximum amount of USDC 10,000.00. Nomev Labs shall not be liable for any actions taken by or on behalf of CoW DAO including Services and actions taken pursuant to this CIP (if passed successfully).\n- Force Majeure. If the provision of the Services are affected, hindered, prohibited or made impossible in whole or in part by a Force Majeure, this shall under no circumstances be deemed a breach of this CIP (if passed successfully).\n- Severance. If any provision of this CIP (if passed successfully) is or becomes invalid, illegal or unenforceable, it shall be deemed modified to the minimum extent necessary to make it valid, legal and enforceable.\n- Disputes. In the event of any dispute, claim, question, or disagreement, CoW DAO and Nomev Labs shall use their best efforts to settle the disagreement. To this effect, they shall consult and negotiate with each other in good faith (using the CoW DAO forum forum.cow.fi or any other Interface) and, recognizing their mutual interests, attempt to reach a just and equitable solution satisfactory to both parties. Any such amicable decision to resolve a dispute shall go through the CoW DAO Governance Mechanism. If no agreement is found within 30 days, the disagreement shall be referred to and finally resolved by arbitration by one arbitrator in London, United Kingdom, under the arbitration rules of the London Court of International Arbitration.\n- Governing Law. This CIP (if passed successfully) shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of England and Wales.",

      "title": "CIP-31.2: Change CoW DAO's (cow.eth) Snapshot space settings",
      "content": "```\nCIP: 31\ntitle: Change CoW DAO's (cow.eth) Snapshot space settings\nauthor: @middleway.eth\nstatus: Active\ncreated: 2023-09-08\n```\n\n## Simple Summary\n\nThis proposal was previously voted for as CIP-31 (https://snapshot.org/#/cow.eth/proposal/0x6dd13bfc9eae35a5f597cea373f21947d4c701ba7ce065c66934c560847484cc).  We assume this CIP didn't pass quorum due to low awareness, evidently it didn't gain any opposition. Therefore it is brought to another voting round.\n\nThis proposal aims to remove `admins` and `authors` from CoW DAO's Snapshot space, add community `moderators`, and introduce a token threshold for submitting new proposals.\nIn order for the DAO to better handle Snapshot space setting in the future, it is proposed to change the `snapshot` text record on [cow.eth](https://app.ens.domains/cow.eth) where the snapshot space settings are defined. Replacing the IPNS record link, to an IPFS record link pointing to a JSON file with the full space settings will [make](https://docs.snapshot.org/user-guides/spaces/create/alternative-way-to-create-a-space) cow.eth the sole owner that is able to change the snapshot settings.\nIn addition it is proposed to extend cow.eth domain registration by 6 years securing it until 2030, costing roughly 2.4 ETH.\n\n## Motivation\nIt is assumed that changes proposed in this proposal will benefit CoW DAO by increasing access and removing choke points for posting snapshot proposals. It will also reduce exposure to changes in the Snapshot space settings by limiting root access to the CoW DAO Safe itself.  \nThis will be done by removing all Snapshot admins, making CoW DAO's Safe the [sole admin](https://docs.snapshot.org/user-guides/spaces/create/alternative-way-to-create-a-space) that can change the cow.eth snapshot space settings, by way of onchain transaction to change the `snapshot` text record. This will remove the risk of snapshot setting being changed by a single admin without authorization from the DAO.\n\nIt is proposed to set 10k COW voting power score as defined by cow.eth snapshot space voting strategies, as the minimum threshold holding to post a new proposal on Snapshot. This will allow anyone holding that amount to post new proposals in the snapshot space, making the technical governance process more inclusive and open. \n\nAs seen in other Snapshot spaces (for example gnosis.eth) this approach sometimes results in spam proposals or proposals that do not comply with the governance precess requirements. In order to mitigate this problem, it is proposed to add community `moderators` who will have the power to filter such proposals as needed, mitigating spam or non-complying proposals who might be submitted by any COW holder with the required holding threshold. \nTo clarify, snapshot space moderators can only add and remove proposal but don't have access to any other action on the space including settings changes.\n\n## Specification\n\nThe `snapshot` text record on cow.eth will be changed to an IPFS record which includes the proposed snapshot space settings:\n- Removing admins\n- Removing authors\n- Adding three moderators\n\nIn addition, the treasury team will be tasked with extending cow.eth registration by 6 years.\n\n## Rationale\n\nUsing an IPFS record defining snapshot settings makes it easier for the DAO to make changes to the snapshot space settings using a secure and transparent onchain process. This can be done by the DAO through oSnap proposal or by Safe signers if needed.\nExtending registration of cow.eth will help avoiding a situation the DAO losing access to this domain.\n\n## Execution\n\n- Repo ([link](https://github.com/cmagan/cow_eth_snapshot/blob/main/settings.json)) including the JSON file copied from CoW DAO's existing settings ([link](https://hub.snapshot.org/api/spaces/cow.eth))\n- JSON file hosted on IPFS ([link](ipfs://bafybeielreqpz3vyozmtdr6xixjpgjtg6qihig3ccgizmyxrs6tko2rzqa/))\n- Testing space ([cowtesting.eth](https://snapshot.org/#/cowtesting.eth)) configured with the above IPFS file in its `snapshot` ENS text record ([link](https://app.ens.domains/cowtesting.eth))\n- Proposed moderators:\n   - Core team: `0x387fe763ddac7a6b568ee344fefc31f626bc837b`\n   - Core team: `0xa312c2ae6a06504cbebe89468e6f9dc01c8b23d4`\n   - Community mod: `0xF44217A8b6b3f258BFFEaD635c226528aa516aea` \n\nThe registration extension of cow.eth domain will be requested to be executed by the treasury management team on behalf of CoW DAO because registration fee is calculated based on a USD/ETH oracle which might cause failure of the transaction if the price deviates during proposal process. \n### Safe Transaction Data\nCreated using the ENS Safe App\n\n```\n{\n  \"version\": \"1.0\",\n  \"chainId\": \"1\",\n  \"createdAt\": 1696242455666,\n  \"meta\": {\n    \"name\": \"Transactions Batch\",\n    \"description\": \"\",\n    \"txBuilderVersion\": \"1.16.3\",\n    \"createdFromSafeAddress\": \"0xcA771eda0c70aA7d053aB1B25004559B918FE662\",\n    \"createdFromOwnerAddress\": \"\",\n    \"checksum\": \"0x11c377d08b42682bb30c334e2fcb1d4eaf106440595d4be1b280243f4c594c8b\"\n  },\n  \"transactions\": [\n    {\n      \"to\": \"0x4976fb03C32e5B8cfe2b6cCB31c09Ba78EBaBa41\",\n      \"value\": \"0\",\n      \"data\": null,\n      \"contractMethod\": {\n        \"inputs\": [\n          {\n            \"name\": \"data\",\n            \"type\": \"bytes[]\",\n            \"internalType\": \"bytes[]\"\n          }\n        ],\n        \"name\": \"multicall\",\n        \"payable\": false\n      },\n      \"contractInputsValues\": {\n        \"data\": \"[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]\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n### Tenderly Simulation\n\n[Simulation link](https://dashboard.tenderly.co/public/safe/safe-apps/simulator/aafc2f69-0d8a-4550-9c32-bb950cdae7c5)",

      "content": "```\nCIP: 31\ntitle: Change CoW DAO's (cow.eth) Snapshot space settings\nauthor: @middleway.eth\nstatus: Active\ncreated: 2023-09-08\n```\n\n## Simple Summary\n\nThis proposal aims to remove `admins` and `authors` from CoW DAO's Snapshot space, add community `moderators`, and introduce a token threshold for submitting new proposals.\nIn order for the DAO to better handle Snapshot space setting in the future, it is proposed to change the `snapshot` text record on [cow.eth](https://app.ens.domains/cow.eth) where the snapshot space settings are defined. Replacing the IPNS record link, to an IPFS record link pointing to a JSON file with the full space settings will [make](https://docs.snapshot.org/user-guides/spaces/create/alternative-way-to-create-a-space) cow.eth the sole owner that is able to change the snapshot settings.\nIn addition it is proposed to extend cow.eth domain registration by 6 years securing it until 2030, costing roughly 2.4 ETH.\n\n## Motivation\nIt is assumed that changes proposed in this proposal will benefit CoW DAO by increasing access and removing choke points for posting snapshot proposals. It will also reduce exposure to changes in the Snapshot space settings by limiting root access to the CoW DAO Safe itself.  \nThis will be done by removing all Snapshot admins, making CoW DAO's Safe the [sole admin](https://docs.snapshot.org/user-guides/spaces/create/alternative-way-to-create-a-space) that can change the cow.eth snapshot space settings, by way of onchain transaction to change the `snapshot` text record. This will remove the risk of snapshot setting being changed by a single admin without authorization from the DAO.\n\nIt is proposed to set 10k COW voting power score as defined by cow.eth snapshot space voting strategies, as the minimum threshold holding to post a new proposal on Snapshot. This will allow anyone holding that amount to post new proposals in the snapshot space, making the technical governance process more inclusive and open. \n\nAs seen in other Snapshot spaces (for example gnosis.eth) this approach sometimes results in spam proposals or proposals that do not comply with the governance precess requirements. In order to mitigate this problem, it is proposed to add community `moderators` who will have the power to filter such proposals as needed, mitigating spam or non-complying proposals who might be submitted by any COW holder with the required holding threshold. \nTo clarify, snapshot space moderators can only add and remove proposal but don't have access to any other action on the space including settings changes.\n\n## Specification\n\nThe `snapshot` text record on cow.eth will be changed to an IPFS record which includes the proposed snapshot space settings:\n- Removing admins\n- Removing authors\n- Adding three moderators\n\nIn addition, the treasury team will be tasked with extending cow.eth registration by 6 years.\n\n## Rationale\n\nUsing an IPFS record defining snapshot settings makes it easier for the DAO to make changes to the snapshot space settings using a secure and transparent onchain process. This can be done by the DAO through oSnap proposal or by Safe signers if needed.\nExtending registration of cow.eth will help avoiding a situation the DAO losing access to this domain.\n\n## Execution\n\n- Repo ([link](https://github.com/cmagan/cow_eth_snapshot/blob/main/settings.json)) including the JSON file copied from CoW DAO's existing settings ([link](https://hub.snapshot.org/api/spaces/cow.eth))\n- JSON file hosted on IPFS ([link](ipfs://bafybeielreqpz3vyozmtdr6xixjpgjtg6qihig3ccgizmyxrs6tko2rzqa/))\n- Testing space ([cowtesting.eth](https://snapshot.org/#/cowtesting.eth)) configured with the above IPFS file in its `snapshot` ENS text record ([link](https://app.ens.domains/cowtesting.eth))\n- Proposed moderators:\n   - Core team: `0x387fe763ddac7a6b568ee344fefc31f626bc837b`\n   - Core team: `0xa312c2ae6a06504cbebe89468e6f9dc01c8b23d4`\n   - Community mod: `0xF44217A8b6b3f258BFFEaD635c226528aa516aea` \n\nThe registration extension of cow.eth domain will be requested to be executed by the treasury management team on behalf of CoW DAO because registration fee is calculated based on a USD/ETH oracle which might cause failure of the transaction if the price deviates during proposal process. \n### Safe Transaction Data\nCreated using the ENS Safe App\n\n```\n{\n  \"version\": \"1.0\",\n  \"chainId\": \"1\",\n  \"createdAt\": 1696242455666,\n  \"meta\": {\n    \"name\": \"Transactions Batch\",\n    \"description\": \"\",\n    \"txBuilderVersion\": \"1.16.3\",\n    \"createdFromSafeAddress\": \"0xcA771eda0c70aA7d053aB1B25004559B918FE662\",\n    \"createdFromOwnerAddress\": \"\",\n    \"checksum\": \"0x11c377d08b42682bb30c334e2fcb1d4eaf106440595d4be1b280243f4c594c8b\"\n  },\n  \"transactions\": [\n    {\n      \"to\": \"0x4976fb03C32e5B8cfe2b6cCB31c09Ba78EBaBa41\",\n      \"value\": \"0\",\n      \"data\": null,\n      \"contractMethod\": {\n        \"inputs\": [\n          {\n            \"name\": \"data\",\n            \"type\": \"bytes[]\",\n            \"internalType\": \"bytes[]\"\n          }\n        ],\n        \"name\": \"multicall\",\n        \"payable\": false\n      },\n      \"contractInputsValues\": {\n        \"data\": \"[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]\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n### Tenderly Simulation\n\n[Simulation link](https://dashboard.tenderly.co/public/safe/safe-apps/simulator/aafc2f69-0d8a-4550-9c32-bb950cdae7c5)",

      "content": "```\nCIP-30: Implementing oSnap for Optimistic Governance in CoW DAO\nauthor: Alex Gaines (againes@umaproject.org), John Shutt (john@umaproject.org), Manny Narang (manny@umaproject.org)\nstatus: active\ncreated: 2023-07-05\n```\n\n## Simple Summary\n\nThis proposal aims to integrate [oSnap](https://uma.xyz/osnap), an optimistic governance tool developed by UMA, into the CoW DAO governance system. By leveraging oSnap, CoW DAO can execute the results of Snapshot votes on-chain, eliminating reliance on multi-signature wallets and promoting a more decentralized and efficient execution process.\n\n## Motivation\n\nThe motivation for this proposal is to enhance CoW DAO’s governance system by making it more efficient, secure, and decentralized. By adopting oSnap, CoW DAO can streamline its governance process and empower its token holders, thereby upholding the true spirit of decentralization.\n\n## Specification\n\nUMA’s oSnap is a tool for making on-chain transactions based on off-chain voting decisions. After the integration of oSnap, the flow works like this:\n\n* A Snapshot proposal can include a transaction payload that is executable if the proposal is approved by the DAO.\n* After a vote completes, any address can post a bond and propose to execute the transactions on-chain by clicking a button on Snapshot.\n* If no dispute arises about the proposal’s accuracy during the dispute window, the transactions are executed.\n* In case of a dispute, the proposal is not executed and needs to be re-proposed. UMA token holders will determine who was correct in the dispute, with the correct party rewarded from the opposing party’s bond.\n\nThe oSnap integration process can be completed in a single afternoon. The steps to integrate oSnap are:\n\n* Install the Zodiac app.\n* Deploy an oSnap module through the Zodiac app.\n* Add oSnap to the CoW DAO Snapshot space through the SafeSnap plug-in.\n\nOverall Cost: There are no fees associated with the implementation of oSnap. There are also no fees to use UMA’s oracle to verify oSnap requests. Therefore, the overall cost of implementation is zero.\n\n## Rationale\n\nCurrent DAO governance models often rely on multi-signature wallets for the execution of proposals, which can lead to delays and potential security vulnerabilities. Implementing oSnap, which allows for on-chain execution of off-chain votes, would eliminate the dependency on multi-sig wallets and the associated issues. Furthermore, oSnap’s dispute mechanism and incentives for correct submissions help maintain the integrity and accuracy of the decision-making process.\n\nThe integration of oSnap into CoW DAO’s governance aligns with the DAO’s mission of decentralization and community involvement. Implementing oSnap will not only streamline the governance process but also eliminate the need for reliance on multi-signature wallets, thereby promoting more direct community control. This approach aligns with the DAO’s guiding value of decentralization by reducing the need for intermediaries and giving more power to the token holders. Moreover, oSnap’s dispute mechanism provides an extra layer of security, ensuring that the outcomes of governance votes accurately reflect what was approved on Snapshot. Finally, the integration of oSnap is free and easy, making it a practical choice for enhancing CoW DAO’s governance.\n\nThe UMA team discussed oSnap with Chen from CoW Protocol, who brought up the importance of monitoring proposals. With oSnap, proposals go to the same closely monitored oracle systems as Polymarket, Sherlock, Cozy, and other oracle requests. Your DAO proposals will populate in UMA's oracle dapp making it easy for people to identify and dispute bad proposals. In practice, questionable Polymarket proposals tend to be disputed within 30 minutes, and those proposals are harder to evaluate than oSnap proposals. Your proposals will also be pulled into bot monitoring systems that members of our competitive disputer network have set up, and you can use our open source code to set up Slack, Discord, and PagerDuty alerts. The Risk Labs engineering team is continuously improving our monitoring and is currently developing a bot that will not only alert on proposals but will automatically dispute if a faulty or malicious proposal is identified.\n\nSince its launch earlier this year, oSnap has been adopted by Across, BarnBridge, ShapeShift, and +DAO to control their on-chain treasuries, securing over $40 million in value. oSnap is also being used by Lossless Protocol to secure their next generation of wrapped tokens.\n\n## Execution\n\n### Safe Transaction Data\n\nThe below shows the multisend call and detailed transaction data for deploying and enabling the oSnap module for the CoW DAO safe.

      "content": "```\nCIP: 29\ntitle: Renewal of the solver rewards program\nauthor: harisang\nstatus: active\ncreated: 2023-08-10\n```\n\n# Simple Summary\n\nThe previous solver rewards budget was defined and approved in [CIP-23](https://snapshot.org/#/cow.eth/proposal/0x864685d094312bc51eeb01af69e83dc7c496108cca54a15b491d79e9ce389889), over five months ago, effectively becoming available on Tuesday, February 28, 2023. The 10M COW tokens allocated for this purpose are now almost depleted, after the payout that took place on Tuesday, August 1, 2023.\n\nThis CIP is intended to propose a renewal of the solver rewards program by allocating an additional 10M COW tokens, projected to last 6 months; specifically, from Tuesday, August 1, 2023 until Tuesday, January 30, 2024.\n\n# Motivation\n\nThere are 16 running solvers at the time of writing, consistently competing to provide the best possible solutions to the batch auctions the protocol is running every few seconds, and consequently ensuring best execution for CoW Protocol users. It is safe to assume that a major motive for running a solver is winning solver rewards. This proposal aims to ensure appropriate funding to continue rewarding solvers and hence supporting a competitive solver landscape.\n\nThe projected estimate presented in CIP-23 was six months, suggesting that the COW tokens allocated should suffice until Tuesday, August 28, 2023. Expenditure on solver rewards since then has closely followed the estimations in CIP-23, except for a few weeks in March and early April where some spikes were observed. As a consequence of these spikes, the COW tokens allocated are almost depleted after the payout that took place on Tuesday, August 1, 2023. This means that the the initial estimate was off by 4 weeks.\n\nSince the launch of CIP-20 on Tuesday, March 21, 2023, and again with the exception of a few weeks, the weekly expenditure is following closely the projected \"10M COW per 6 months\" estimate. In fact, with the launch of [CIP-27](https://snapshot.org/#/cow.eth/proposal/0x64e061568e86e8d2eec344d4a892e4126172b992cabe59a0b24c51c4c7e6cc33),  which reallocated part of the solver rewards to the price estimation competition, there has been an unintentional gradual correction in the budget, as solver teams are still preparing their solvers to become price estimators, thus resulting in reduced expenditure over the last few weeks. This suggests that, in fact, 10M COW will most likely suffice for the first 6 months after CIP-20 was enabled. ([Here](https://dune.com/queries/2812938?blockchain=ethereum&category=essentials&subcategory=abstraction&namespace=erc20&table=evt_Transfer&blockchains=ethereum&StartTime_d83555=2023-03-22+00%3A00%3A00&EndTime_d83555=2023-08-02+00%3A00%3A00) is a relevant Dune query that allows to track expenses in a given time window).\n\nThe above gives us confidence that 10M COW is indeed a good estimate for the next 6 months as well, and thus, this CIP proposes to allocate an additional 10M COW to be used for solver rewards, and estimates that this amount should suffice until Tuesday, January 30, 2024 (starting the accounting on Tuesday, August 1, 2023).\n\nAs with previous related CIPs, It is important to note that this budgeting proposal is independent of additional proposals to potentially change the solver reward structure, which can be configured for appropriate spending according to the budget.\n\n# Specification\n\nTransfer 10M COW from CoW DAO (`0xca771eda0c70aa7d053ab1b25004559b918fe662`) to the Solver Rewards safe (`0xA03be496e67Ec29bC62F01a428683D7F9c204930`)\n\n## Rationale\n\nSolver rewards are planned to continue using the same operational structure, carried out from the solver rewards safe. ETH for compensating gas execution costs is estimated to be fully covered by collecting fees from users.\n\nIt is proposed to allocate 10M COW tokens for a 6 month period of rewards. This represents a yearly budget of 20M COW tokens, 2% of the COW token supply, valued at $1.35M according to current market price.\n\n# Safe Transaction Data\n```\n{\n  \"version\": \"1.0\",\n  \"chainId\": \"1\",\n  \"createdAt\": 1691577281332,\n  \"meta\": {\n    \"name\": \"Transactions Batch\",\n    \"description\": \"\",\n    \"txBuilderVersion\": \"1.16.1\",\n    \"createdFromSafeAddress\": \"0xcA771eda0c70aA7d053aB1B25004559B918FE662\",\n    \"createdFromOwnerAddress\": \"\",\n    \"checksum\": \"0xcc75a14a9f2f6de90b61c0ed9f7254f0bbdedf9c61d1e98643c57345efdd7bcb\"\n  },\n  \"transactions\": [\n    {\n      \"to\": \"0xDEf1CA1fb7FBcDC777520aa7f396b4E015F497aB\",\n      \"value\": \"0\",\n      \"data\": null,\n      \"contractMethod\": {\n        \"inputs\": [\n          {\n            \"name\": \"recipient\",\n            \"type\": \"address\",\n            \"internalType\": \"address\"\n          },\n          {\n            \"name\": \"amount\",\n            \"type\": \"uint256\",\n            \"internalType\": \"uint256\"\n          }\n        ],\n        \"name\": \"transfer\",\n        \"payable\": false\n      },\n      \"contractInputsValues\": {\n        \"recipient\": \"0xA03be496e67Ec29bC62F01a428683D7F9c204930\",\n        \"amount\": \"10000000000000000000000000\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n## Tenderly Simultation\n[Link to Tenderly simulation.](https://dashboard.tenderly.co/public/safe/safe-apps/simulator/0b9f8a60-d9ae-4350-b5bb-12a8bda7557c)",

      "content": "```\nCIP: 28\ntitle: Should CoW DAO send its profits to the CoW Treasury Core unit to generate extra revenues?\nauthor: karpatkey\nstatus: Draft\ncreated: 2023-07-14\n```\n\n# Simple Summary\n\nThis proposal aims to direct the profits generated by the CoW protocol to the Treasury Core unit 1. The intention is to utilize these otherwise idle funds in DeFi strategies to generate yield and farm rewards, thereby creating additional revenue streams for the DAO, particularly while further Protocol investment projects are not ongoing. These revenues can be reinvested into CoW development, funding projects, providing grants, executing $COW buybacks, and more.\n\n# Motivation\n\nThe CoW DAO has the opportunity to leverage its profits more effectively. By directing excess liquidity from profits to the Treasury Core unit for active management, the DAO can engage in yield-generating DeFi strategies, which can significantly increase the DAO’s revenue. These additional funds can be used to accelerate the growth and development of CoW and enhance the overall value proposition of the CoW ecosystem.\n\nFor instance, consider a scenario where a portion of the funds, say 300-400 ETH ($550K-$750K), is used to provide liquidity in ETH-based yield farming strategies. New strategies can be deployed with these funds, as the initial balance of the DAO Treasury focused on maximising capital utilisation. These strategies can average an APR of 7%, which could result in an extra yearly revenue stream of approximately $50K. Here are some potential strategies:\n\nStaking in Lido and holding stETH, which at the time of writing yields around 4% APR.\nDepositing in stETH/ETH or rETH/ETH pools and staking on platforms like Convex or Aura, which can offer an APR of approximately 7%.\nDepositing in pools with other assets such as $BAL, $AURA, $CRV, $CVX, $COW, which can potentially yield 15%+ APR.\nThese strategies not only provide a significant boost to the DAO’s revenue but also diversify the risk across different assets and platforms.\n\nIt’s worth noting these funds can be returned to the CoW DAO as needed - with an indicative SLA of 10 days. While a more fundamental discussion is due about the management of protocol revenues, we want to ensure the DAO is maximizing its capital efficiency in the meantime. Those funds would still be accounted for as protocol revenue and be up for future DAO decisions.\n\nThe allocated profits currently arise from two sources, namely:\n\nSurplus from the protocol operations - Safe 2 - which would be redirected by the CoW Core team upon successful passing of the proposal, on a monthly basis;\nRebates from MEVBlocker - Safe 1 - which would be redirected by the CoW DAO upon successful passing of the proposal, as a single time transaction.\n\n# Proposal\nThat the profits generated by the CoW protocol are sent to the CoW DAO Treasury Core unit:\nThat the CoW Core team redirects idle (W)ETH from the solver rewards safe (eth:0xA03be496e67Ec29bC62F01a428683D7F9c204930 2) to the treasury safe (eth:0x616dE58c011F8736fa20c7Ae5352F7f6FB9F0669), monthly on the first week of the month;\nThat the CoW DAO redirects MEV Blocker rebates (eth:0xCe91228789B57DEb45e66Ca10Ff648385fE7093b) to the treasury safe (eth:0x616dE58c011F8736fa20c7Ae5352F7f6FB9F0669);\nThat the CoW DAO Treasury Core unit actively manages these funds to generate extra revenue for the DAO.\n\n# Payload\n\nSend 213 ETH and 237 WETH from Solver rewards\n\n```\n{\n  \"version\": \"1.0\",\n  \"chainId\": \"1\",\n  \"createdAt\": 1690277469777,\n  \"meta\": {\n    \"name\": \"Transactions Batch\",\n    \"description\": \"\",\n    \"txBuilderVersion\": \"1.16.1\",\n    \"createdFromSafeAddress\": \"0xA03be496e67Ec29bC62F01a428683D7F9c204930\",\n    \"createdFromOwnerAddress\": \"\",\n    \"checksum\": \"0x827cec7aa7ef053394607302303d3cd8814836913c7ca483ae32495a829ffef5\"\n  },\n  \"transactions\": [\n    {\n      \"to\": \"0xC02aaA39b223FE8D0A0e5C4F27eAD9083C756Cc2\",\n      \"value\": \"0\",\n      \"data\": null,\n      \"contractMethod\": {\n        \"inputs\": [\n          {\n            \"name\": \"dst\",\n            \"type\": \"address\"\n          },\n          {\n            \"name\": \"wad\",\n            \"type\": \"uint256\"\n          }\n        ],\n        \"name\": \"transfer\",\n        \"payable\": false\n      },\n      \"contractInputsValues\": {\n        \"dst\": \"0x616dE58c011F8736fa20c7Ae5352F7f6FB9F0669\",\n        \"wad\": \"237000000000000000000\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"to\": \"0x616dE58c011F8736fa20c7Ae5352F7f6FB9F0669\",\n      \"value\": \"213000000000000000000\",\n      \"data\": null,\n      \"contractMethod\": null,\n      \"contractInputsValues\": {\n        \"guy\": \"\",\n        \"wad\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nSend 70 ETH from MEV Blocker rebates\n\n```\n{\n  \"version\": \"1.0\",\n  \"chainId\": \"1\",\n  \"createdAt\": 1690277622927,\n  \"meta\": {\n    \"name\": \"Transactions Batch\",\n    \"description\": \"\",\n    \"txBuilderVersion\": \"1.16.1\",\n    \"createdFromSafeAddress\": \"0xCe91228789B57DEb45e66Ca10Ff648385fE7093b\",\n    \"createdFromOwnerAddress\": \"\",\n    \"checksum\": \"0x85ddc766cd28f01a0042eab961d3a2d694088791843cf09af6ee13211eaa3250\"\n  },\n  \"transactions\": [\n    {\n      \"to\": \"0x616dE58c011F8736fa20c7Ae5352F7f6FB9F0669\",\n      \"value\": \"70000000000000000000\",\n      \"data\": null,\n      \"contractMethod\": null,\n      \"contractInputsValues\": {\n        \"guy\": \"\",\n        \"wad\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

      "content": "```\nCIP: 27\ntitle: Incentives Mechanism for the Price Estimation Competition\nauthor: @harisang\nstatus: active\ncreated:  2023-06-20\n\n```\n# Simple Summary\nPrice estimation is currently a key component of the protocol. This proposal aims to set up a rewards mechanism in order to incentivize all solvers participating in the solver competition to become estimators in the price estimation competition.\n\n# Motivation\nAs outlined in [this post](https://forum.cow.fi/t/towards-a-stronger-price-estimation-competition/1699), price estimation is integral for the success of the protocol. Establishing a robust, consistent and competitive quoting mechanism will lead to more accurate quotes for the users, much better fee estimation and will eventually minimize the percent of expired orders (i.e., orders that got a quote but solvers were not able to realize it). This will, ultimately, lead to increased traffic in the protocol.\n\nCurrently, only a subset of the solvers participating in the solver competition do price estimation. Concretely, only Gnosis solvers and SeaSolver are participating in the price estimation competition. Many Gnosis solvers solely rely on external APIs (such as 1inch, 0x), and from time to time these solvers get rate-limited, thus resulting in suboptimal performance. Due to this, significant dependency on external APIs poses a non-trivial risk to the protocol, and we believe that by encouraging multiple solvers to participate in the price estimation competition would mitigate this and would result in very consistent good quoting. Moreover, the solver competition is already in an advanced stage, where solvers have evolved a lot and are quite sophisticated, and able in many cases to outperform external APIs. For all these reasons, we believe it is crucial to make the price estimation competition stronger by having solvers participate in it.\n\n# Specification\nTo incentivize solver participation in the price estimation competition, we propose to reallocate 20% of the COW rewards towards the price estimation competition; these rewards are currently allocated for the solver competition and intended to be distributed as consistency rewards. As a reminder, there is a total of 20M COW tokens allocated for solver rewards over a year, which corresponds to an average weekly budget of 383307 COW for solver rewards, of which 25%, or 95826 COW, is intended to be used for consistency rewards, as specified by [CIP-20](https://snapshot.org/#/cow.eth/proposal/0x2d3f9bd1ea72dca84b03e97dda3efc1f4a42a772c54bd2037e8b62e7d09a491f).\n\nA reallocation of 20% of the COW rewards budget, is equal to 4M COW over a year, would mean that the protocol would aim to spend ~77,000 COW per week, in  the price estimation competition. Given the weekly budget of 77,000 COW for price estimation, we propose the following distribution mechanism:\n\n1. Every market order being placed in the orderbook is associated with a quote, that is the winning quote of the corresponding price estimation competition that took place. We link each order with the solver that gave this winning quote. We stress here that for a quote to be eligible for participating in the price estimation competition, full calldata must be provided which should be able to successfully simulate.\n\n2. For every market order that a solver provided a winning quote for, we track whether it got successfully executed onchain or whether it expired and in the case where the order got successfully executed onchain, the solver that provided the winning quote gets a reward of 9 COW. \n\nAlong with the weekly solver payouts, these price estimation rewards will also be distributed on a weekly basis, and will be sent out to the rewards addresses used in the solver competition.\n\n**Note:** We stress that the majority of quotes do not lead to order creation. We view this as something positive, as price estimators would have to be consistent and provide quotes for most of the requests in order to get rewarded, as one cannot know in advance if a certain request will lead to an order being placed in the orderbook.\n\nWe also want to stress that only solvers participating in the solver competition can participate in the price estimation competition. We believe this is a reasonable constraint, as a very competitive quote by an estimator that is not participating as a solver might lead to orders getting very good quotes that are not matchable by any solver.\n\n### Starting date\nIn order to give some time to solvers, as well as the core team, to prepare for this change,  we propose that this new rewards mechanism is activated on July 18, 2023, with the first adapted payout taking place on July 25, 2023.\n\n(Further discussion and some sanity checks on the numbers proposed can be viewed in the [relevant forum thread](https://forum.cow.fi/t/cip-draft-incentives-mechanism-for-the-price-estimation-competition/1718).)",

      "content": "```\nCIP: 26\ntitle: Solver bond funds switch\nauthor: lpm_machado\nstatus: Draft\ncreated: 2023-05-26\n```\n\n# Simple Summary\n\nThe CoW DAO owns and operates a [solver bond](https://etherscan.io/address/0x5d4020b9261F01B6f8a45db929704b0Ad6F5e9E6) (as per [CIP-7: Allowing External Solvers](https://forum.cow.fi/t/cip-7-allowing-external-solvers/923) and [CIP-15: Reimbursement of Solver Bond & Transfer of ownership](https://forum.cow.fi/t/cip-15-reimbursement-of-solver-bond-transfer-of-ownership/1193)) which acts as a guarantee in the case of misbehavior by solvers that are part of the pool.\n\nThis CIP proposes a change to the funds part of the bond. The current solver bond funds have been KYC’ed and they originate from CoW DAO’s [KYCed daughter Safe](https://app.safe.global/home?safe=eth:0xA1cb7762F40318ee0260F53e15De835fF001cb7E). The currently bonded USDC 500.000 shall be transferred back and swapped with USDC 500.000 in non-KYC’ed funds currently under active treasury management.\n\n# Motivation\n\nFollowing [CIP-7 - Allowing External Solvers](https://forum.cow.fi/t/cip-7-allowing-external-solvers/923), a bonding pool was created to insure the Protocol against malicious solvers while at the same time fostering decentralisation.\n\n[CoW DAO itself](https://forum.cow.fi/t/cip-15-reimbursement-of-solver-bond-transfer-of-ownership/1193) owns and provides one of the active bonds — reducing the barrier of entry.\n\n500.000 USDC of the funds allocated to this bond were taken from CoW DAO’s [KYC’ed daughter Safe](https://app.safe.global/home?safe=eth:0xA1cb7762F40318ee0260F53e15De835fF001cb7E). The KYC’ed funds were purposefully set aside by CoW DAO for the service provision of the development of the CoW Suite.\n\nWith this purpose in mind, this CIP proposes a transfer of 500.000 USDC from one of the CoW DAO Treasury Safes to the CoW DAO-[owned solver bond address ](https://etherscan.io/address/0x5d4020b9261F01B6f8a45db929704b0Ad6F5e9E6)first. As a second step, the current 500.000 USD part of the solver bond would be transferred back to the same CoW DAO Treasury Safe and will be actively managed by the Treasury Team.\n\n# Proposal\n\n  1. That the Treasury Core team transfers USDC 500.000 from the [mainnet treasury safe](https://app.safe.global/transactions/queue?safe=eth:0x616dE58c011F8736fa20c7Ae5352F7f6FB9F0669) to the CoW DAO-[owned solver bond address ](https://etherscan.io/address/0x5d4020b9261F01B6f8a45db929704b0Ad6F5e9E6)\n  2. That the equivalent of USDC 500,000 in CUSD is swapped (limit order) in CoW Swap by the [CoW DAO Solver Bond](https://app.safe.global/balances?safe=eth:0x5d4020b9261F01B6f8a45db929704b0Ad6F5e9E6) with the [mainnet treasury safe](https://app.safe.global/transactions/queue?safe=eth:0x616dE58c011F8736fa20c7Ae5352F7f6FB9F0669) as the recipient address.",

These require low funding amounts, but payments that are sent frequently (eg. network fees, testing, user studies etc.)\n\nThis CIP proposes the creation of a CoW DAO-owned operational spend Safe to reduce overhead. This safe would be funded for ecosystem transactions such as network fees, testing funds, and potentially small, unforeseen bounties or community-approved reimbursements. Additionally, the ETH-flow refunder for the native ETH-flow support requires funding, which this operational Safe would be able to provide.\n\nThis CIP asks for a funding allocation of 80 ETH.\n\n# Motivation\n\nThis CIP asks to transfer 80 ETH (ca. 145k USD equivalent) into a Safe at eth:0x46861c73480d35AA285f1420Ba80e76766F9885c.\n\nThis Safe would reduce the overhead related to funding on-chain operations that further the development of the CoW Suite along the lines dictated by the [Service Agreement](https://forum.cow.fi/t/cip-24-continued-funding-for-development-services-service-agreement-no-2/1531) and operated on behalf of CoW DAO.\n\nThese funds will be used as necessary in the development of the CoW Protocol Suite and related undertakings, namely:\n\n1. Deployment of smart contracts;\n2. Audit services for smart contracts;\n3. Bounties;\n4. Testing of features (like partial orders, milkman upgrades, and others);\n5. User studies;\n6. Funding of the ETHFlow refunder wallets;\n7. Funding for gas and signers;\n\nTo implement this proposal, a new nested Safe with a threshold of 1/2 owned by CoW DAO and by a Safe operated by the [Core team](https://app.safe.global/transactions/queue?safe=etH:0x6adc7A8e9a73dBF1096a425cABe07b83060D4bA4) shall be deployed and named “Operational CoW DAO Safe”.\n\nAdditionally, operational EOAs will be created and funded with a maximum of 5 ETH at any given time to facilitate the frictionless usage of funds (also on different chains). Any significant transaction above this amount will be initiated from the “Operational CoW DAO Safe” directly. The diagram below depicts the intended structure.\n\n![636ee44d48b8b283f1481b3276a5d257e8543859.png](ipfs://bafkreifgdnlsr6wdwqx6rxik3yuslm5an4xrdal5d4sklpnft65x4bnkrq)\n\n(*) Note: Cow logo wallets represent CoW DAO Owned wallets.\n\nAny unused funds from the Operational CoW DAO Safe can, at any moment, be withdrawn by CoW DAO’s [main Safe](https://app.safe.global/home?safe=eth:0xcA771eda0c70aA7d053aB1B25004559B918FE662) and re-allocated for any other community-driven initiative.\n\nFurther top-ups will require a summarised expense report of prior funding along with another CIP.\n\nThe assets in the operational CoW DAO Safe will remain idle (no asset management) and should be allocated from this CoW DAO [Safe](https://app.safe.global/balances?safe=eth:0xA03be496e67Ec29bC62F01a428683D7F9c204930).\n\n# Proposal\n\n\n  1. Deployment of a new nested Safe named “Operational CoW DAO Safe”, with a threshold of 1/2 owned by the CoW DAO [main Safe](https://app.safe.global/home?safe=eth:0xcA771eda0c70aA7d053aB1B25004559B918FE662) and a [Core team Safe](https://app.safe.global/transactions/queue?safe=etH:0x6adc7A8e9a73dBF1096a425cABe07b83060D4bA4).\n  2. Transfer of 80 ETH to eth:0x46861c73480d35AA285f1420Ba80e76766F9885c.",

      "content": "```\nCIP: 24\ntitle: Continued funding for development services - Service Agreement No 2\nauthor: @c3rnst\nstatus: activ\ncreated: 2023-03-06\n```\n\n**Note: Due to the word count limitations, below is a shortened version of the proposal (excl. the review of the past year, the budget explanations and the team info). Full version [available on the forum](https://forum.cow.fi/t/cip-24-continued-funding-for-development-services-service-agreement-no-2/1531).**\n\n### Simple Summary\n\nThis proposal asks for 6,000,000 USDC to be allocated to the service provider Nomev Labs, covering the execution of the Services on a consumption basis, for the period of April 2023 to and including February 2024.\n\nThe requested sum should be paid out of the KYCed 14.75M USDC raised and set aside by CoW DAO in February 2022 for the service provision of the development of the CoW Suite.\n\nOverall, this will leave a total of 2,749,876 USDC KYCed funds at CoW DAO’s disposal (of which 2.2M currently in use by CoW DAO’s Core Treasury Team, cf. passed CIP-19 proposal [here](https://forum.cow.fi/t/cip-19-karpatkey-dao-proposal-to-create-a-core-treasury-team/1279/3), 0.5M currently in CoW DAO’s Solver Bond and the remaining 49,876 USDC in the [CoW DAO’s Daughter Safe](https://app.safe.global/balances?safe=eth:0xA1cb7762F40318ee0260F53e15De835fF001cb7E)).\n\n### Motivation\n\nOur continued motivation is to fulfill CoW DAO’s vision of a decentralised future where digital assets can be traded in a fair, efficient and reliable manner among people and communities around the world. Trades must be securely protected, no matter who the user is.\nWe consider this CIP critical to ensure ongoing development and refinement of the CoW Suite and for keeping a competitive edge within the decentralised exchange ecosystem, including strategic pivots.\n\n### Service Agreement\n\nServices\n\n- Code development and design based on the roadmap (cf. 1.b);\n- Continuous improvement of the existing product and user experience;\n- Executing relevant user research and proposing roadmap adjustments based on its findings;\n- On behalf of CoW DAO, hosting relevant interfaces, upkeeping and housekeeping of forum.cow.fi;\n- Assisting the CoWmunity in the promotion of the CoW Suite, including at and for conferences and with promotional materials;\n- Fostering collaborations and partnerships on behalf of CoW DAO;\n- Any other assistance and advice that may be provided by the team’s expertise, e.g. computer engineering, design as well as relevant project management and accounting services;\n- Facilitating solver onboarding, vetting and assisting with payouts on behalf of CoW DAO;\n- Ensuring system security, providing development operations and security personnel. Per need, driving bug bounties for CoW DAO’s settlement (incl. via Grants DAO);\n- Engaging the CoWmunity in the decision making process using the regular governing mechanism;\n- Engaging with interested parties in outlining a potential next fundraising round on behalf of CoW DAO with alignment on KYC needs (to be decided);\n- Effective outsourcing to specialists and external parties.\n\nOther Services may be included in further CIPs for CoW DAO to decide upon separately (they can but must not lead to additional funding requests, dependent on scope, timing and efforts).\n\nDevelopment roadmap\n\nThe roadmap is decided by the CoW DAO by means of improvement proposals and forum upon suggestions from any interested contributor. It’s the responsibility of CoW DAO and its members to propose and decide the way forward - we want to comply with this ethos: it’s important to keep this roadmap flexible to adjust to community voices and successful proposals, changing competitive environments as well as improving and changing technological advancements.\nWe propose that the next 3 months will be dedicated to the following items and features:\n\n- Customer Order Interaction\n- Partially fillable orders\n- Automatic indexing of smart contract orders\n- Node diversity and trade quality monitoring\n- The interface’s features will include other wallet integrations, hard cancellations, bundling Safe transactions, partial fills, improving limit orders experience and significant improvement of the technical code and SDK (software development kit)\n- Confirming or iterating on a DAO-user focus\n- Re-evaluating the effectiveness, transparency and trust-minimization of the CoW governance platform\n\nFeatures that might follow after the improvements mentioned above are in place:\n\n- Adding support for EIP2612 (allowing gasless approvals);\n- Deployment on selected Layer 2s;\n- Canonical batches;\n- Improving the Batch Explorer and adding more information;\n- Adding more information to the CoW Swap UI (eg user surplus, trading charts etc., subject to user research).\n\nBudget\n\nFrom 1. April 2023 - 29. February 2024, the USD budget estimate comprises the following significant positions:\n\n| Cost Centre | Estimation (USD) |\n| --- | --- |\n| Team compensation (aggregate) | 3,850,000 |\n| Third party services | 1,030,000 |\n| Events & Travel | 180,000 |\n| Network fees & testing | 170,000 |\n| Hosting | 108,000 |\n| External tooling | 35,000 |\n| Office | 27,000 |\n| Tax provision | 600,000 |\n| Total | 6,000,000 |\n\n### II Terms of the Service Agreement\n\nValidity\n\n- This Service Agreement and any following Service Agreement is subject to the successful passage of the Governance Mechanism set in place by CoW DAO (and as defined in the implemented Participation Agreement or any updated version thereof).\n- The commencing of the Services is effective per successful passing of the proposal, starting from 1 April 2023.\n- There is no automatic extension or renewal of this Service Agreement.\n- The agreement cannot be terminated within the 11 month period (1 April 2023 - 29 February 2024).\n\nCompensation\n\n- The fee for the Services described above is 6,000,000 USDC (six million USDC).\n- The fee corresponds to an estimate of the sum of all costs borne by the performance of the Services starting 1 April 2023 and comprising an entire calendar year, based on a time and material basis.\n- The costs incurred with the provision of the Services to be considered are the direct and indirect costs.\n- If in doubt, the fee is considered to be split equally across calendar months.\n- The Company may review the fee according to actual costs incurred on a monthly basis, proposing changes and amendments, which in turn will be subject to the Governance Mechanism and therefore approval by CoW DAO.\n- Any request for changes or amendments will be accompanied by a justification of prior costs borne (time reporting).\n\nPayment\n\n- With the successful passing of the proposal CoW DAO agrees to a prepayment of the fee and is not subject to additional invoices.\n- Unless Nomev Labs asks for further compensation due to incorrect estimation no detailed time report will be provided.\n- The prepayment is to be transferred from CoW DAO’s daughter Safe at the successful passage of Phase II.\n\nScope\n\n- Some of the line items mentioned in the budget may decrease in the future, some may increase over the coming year.\n- If the Services substantially widen and Nomev Labs grows its team for this purpose, Nomev Labs will propose a further Service Agreement.\n- If Nomev Labs may dissolve any accounting provisions (such as tax provisions), resulting positive cash-flow will be reinvested into the company, in line with CoW DAO’s vision of a decentralised future and mission of enhancing the CoW Suite.\n\nIntellectual Property\n\n- All rights related to works, new products and processes, or correction or improvement of products or processes already existing in the CoW Suite in addition to works, inventions or creations, designs or models, trademarks, trade names, logos, software, databases, domain names or other materials and know-how (including trade secrets), whether registered or not, and regardless of their patentability, registrability or fixation, that Nomev Labs, individually or jointly, has created or whose creation has provided during the Service Agreement to provide services that relate, directly or indirectly, to the business of the CoW DAO, (hereinafter, “Intellectual Property”), belong by origin and since their creation to CoW DAO in accordance with the CoW DAO’s Participation Agreement (the “Participation Agreement”).\n- This effect occurs when the Intellectual Property is generated during the provision of Services by Nomev Labs, regardless of whether or not the creation, or the cause of the creation, of the Intellectual Property is, wholly or partially, directly or through a third party.\n\nMiscellaneous (in no particular order)\n\n- Profit. The company may incur a profit. Profits are to be reinvested into the company, in line with CoW DAO’s vision of a decentralised future and mission of enhancing the CoW Suite.\n- Subcontracting.

Expenditure on solver rewards in this period were very closely according to estimations in CIP-10, COW tokens allocated for this purpose are going to be depleted roughly at the end of February. \n\nThis CIP is intended to propose a new budget for solver rewards.\n\n## Motivation\n\nThere are 12 independently running solvers at the time of writing, consistently competing to provide batch solutions and consequently ensuring best-execution for CoW Swap users. It is safe to assume that a major motive for running a solver is winning solver rewards. This proposal aims to ensure appropriate funding to continue rewarding solvers and hence supporting a competitive solver landscape.\n\nIt is important to note that this budgeting proposal is independent of additional proposals to potentially change the solver reward structure (**[CIP-Draft: Auction model for solver rewards](https://forum.cow.fi/t/cip-draft-auction-model-for-solver-rewards/1405)),** which can be configured for appropriate spending according to the budget.\n\n## Specification\n\nTransfer 10M COW from CoW DAO (`0xca771eda0c70aa7d053ab1b25004559b918fe662`) to the Solver Rewards safe (`0xA03be496e67Ec29bC62F01a428683D7F9c204930`)\n\n## Rationale\n\nSolver rewards are planned to continue using the same operational structure, carried out from the solver rewards safe. ETH for compensating gas execution costs is estimated to be fully covered by collecting fees from users. \n\nIt is proposed to allocate 10M COW tokens for a 6 month period of rewards. This represents a yearly budget of 20M COW tokens, 2% of the COW token supply, valued at $2M according to current market price.\n\n## Safe Transaction Data\n\n```\n{\n  \"version\": \"1.0\",\n  \"chainId\": \"1\",\n  \"createdAt\": 1676550634166,\n  \"meta\": {\n    \"name\": \"Transactions Batch\",\n    \"description\": \"\",\n    \"txBuilderVersion\": \"1.13.2\",\n    \"createdFromSafeAddress\": \"0xcA771eda0c70aA7d053aB1B25004559B918FE662\",\n    \"createdFromOwnerAddress\": \"\",\n    \"checksum\": \"0x6c3f8c79e18b3e80814b04c0fbd538a1da674e4b7c290ad5620eda53e0653f6d\"\n  },\n  \"transactions\": [\n    {\n      \"to\": \"0xDEf1CA1fb7FBcDC777520aa7f396b4E015F497aB\",\n      \"value\": \"0\",\n      \"data\": null,\n      \"contractMethod\": {\n        \"inputs\": [\n          {\n            \"internalType\": \"address\",\n            \"name\": \"recipient\",\n            \"type\": \"address\"\n          },\n          {\n            \"internalType\": \"uint256\",\n            \"name\": \"amount\",\n            \"type\": \"uint256\"\n          }\n        ],\n        \"name\": \"transfer\",\n        \"payable\": false\n      },\n      \"contractInputsValues\": {\n        \"recipient\": \"0xA03be496e67Ec29bC62F01a428683D7F9c204930\",\n        \"amount\": \"10000000000000000000000000\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n```\n\n### Tenderly Simulation\n\n[Link](https://dashboard.tenderly.co/public/safe/safe-apps/simulator/97ef7450-6b3f-4a2c-bdce-424fb1bc3473) to Tenderly simulation",

      "title": "CIP-22: Slashing of the Barter Solver (responsible for a hack causing CoW DAO a loss of 1 week fee accrual)",
      "content": "```\nCIP: 22\ntitle: Slashing of the Barter Solver\nauthor: Anna\nstatus: active\ncreated: 2023-02-08\n```\n**Simple Summary**\n\nOn February 7th 2023, the Barter Solver was hacked, causing the CoW settlement contract to lose a total of [$166,182.97](https://dune.com/queries/1975506) in funds (CoW Swap’s accrued fees of the last 7 days). The Barter Solver had been added to CoW DAO’s Solver Bonding Pool and was whitelisted 11 days prior to the incident. In line with [CIP-7](https://snapshot.org/#/cow.eth/proposal/0x267edf7a0bd3c771cfca763322f011ee106d8d5158612c11da29183260d1dba7) it is CoW DAO’s responsibility to assess the damages caused and decide whether the bond should be slashed to make up for any incurred losses. In this case the hack and its cause and impact can clearly be identified, it is therefore proposed to slash CoW DAO’s Bonding Pool in the size of the funds drained by the hack in order to refund the CoW settlement contract.\n\nIt is important to note here that CoW DAO’s Bonding Pool was created with help of CoW DAO’s own funds. The rationale behind setting up CoW DAO’s own Bonding Pool was to reduce the entry barrier for new solvers. Solvers have to undergo a vetting process before being added. The Barter Solver has been collaborative since the occurrence of the hack and already made a transfer of 166,300 USDC to COW DAO’s Bonding Pool, covering the total amount proposed to be slashed in order to cover the incurred losses in the settlement contract.\n\n**Motivation / Rationale**\n\nCoW DAO is aware that the funds stored in the CoW settlement contract are exposed to some risks due to the nature of the solver competition: in order to ensure optimal execution, solvers are allowed to tap into the funds stored in the CoW settlement contract (called the “buffers”) to replace certain AMM interactions and thus save on gas, reduce execution risk and thus improve the overall user experience. In order to mitigate the risk of solvers exploiting their access to the buffers and thus causing financial losses to CoW DAO, solvers have to join a bonding pool before being allow-listed. This bonding pool mechanism was set up under [CIP-7](https://snapshot.org/#/cow.eth/proposal/0x267edf7a0bd3c771cfca763322f011ee106d8d5158612c11da29183260d1dba7), which requires solvers to deposit $500,000 worth of cUSDC and 1.5M COW tokens as collateral. In the event of malicious behavior or a hack, it is CoW DAO’s responsibility to slash part of the solver bond to cover for the losses incurred.\n\nA list of the events in order of occurrence:\n\n* The Barter Solver got whitelisted and added to the CoW Bonding Pool on Jan 27th ([tx link](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x7374b8157267b0c6d8cc05e812e68ddff045c5bdb5ca915c32193e9f752d5947))\n* Shortly after, the Barter Solver set an approval to a contract allowing arbitrary calls ([tx link](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x92f906bce94bab417cccc87ae046448d7fb8c2c0350b7ed911545577acb3bfc1)), allowing for anyone to use this approval to transferFrom\n* The Barter Solver noted security issues and therefore deployed a new contract which has no arbitrary execution code functionality built in ([link](https://etherscan.io/address/0xCce534eE5eba0bC94ddBB2B831D264AD86a5FFf4)), **but didn’t clear the allowances set to the old contract**\n* Feb 7th, a hacker exploited the old contract and drained about $166K in funds from the settlement contract. ([link](https://dune.com/queries/1543508))\n* Feb 7th, the Nomev Team, which is responsible for the handling of the settlement contract delegated by and on behalf of CoW DAO, revoked all approvals from the old contract and denylisted the Barter Solver\n* Feb 7th, a few hours after the hack, the Barter Solver sent 166,300 USDC to the CoW Bonding Pool ([tx link](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x61a5196468b276bcedc3aab2f2fe255c2d54ca1c655523f4b25c99b1a224e715))\n\nBased on the events and the collaboration of the Barter Solver in the aftermath of the hack, no malicious intent by the Barter Solver can be determined. However, due to the gross negligent failure of revoking previously set approvals by the Barter Solver, CoW DAO incurred financial losses of $166,183. It is therefore proposed to slash the bonding pool the Barter Solver is part of in the full amount of the funds lost in the hack and send those funds to the [Solver Rewards Safe](https://app.safe.global/eth:0xA03be496e67Ec29bC62F01a428683D7F9c204930/home) to cover the lack of fees withdrawn from that week.\n\nThough now having occurred for the first time, it’s important to stress that this is an intended process. Decentralization is insured by a diverse set of solvers and there should explicitly not be an entity controlling and overseeing each solver's strategies and blockchain interactions. The bonding pool and slashing set-up is the risk mitigation for letting every solver access the settlement contract, adding a lot of efficiency, in the interest of the users!\n\nGiven the facts of the matter, the Barter Solver is free to rejoin the pool in case this proposal passes and the reimbursement process of both the CoW settlement contract and the CoW Bonding Pool is completed. \n\n**Specification**\n1. Withdraw all USDC from Compound\n2. Claim COMP rewards\n3. Slash the CoW Bonding Pool by sending 166,183 USDC to the [Solver Rewards Safe](https://app.safe.global/eth:0xA03be496e67Ec29bC62F01a428683D7F9c204930/home)  to refund the losses incurred by the hack.\n4. Reinstantiate the bonding pool using 500k USDC (including 166,300 USDC compensation received from the Barter Solver), by depositing to Compound v2. This ensures that the requirements of CIP-7 are met and sufficient funding is available in the CoW Bonding Pool for the continuous operation of its participating solvers.\n5. Send all remaining funds in the bonding pool safe (generated from bonding pool yield) to the [treasury management safe](https://etherscan.io/address/0x616dE58c011F8736fa20c7Ae5352F7f6FB9F0669): 3.4k USDC, and 41.4 COMP\n\n## Safe Transaction Data\n\n```\n{\n  \"version\": \"1.0\",\n  \"chainId\": \"1\",\n  \"createdAt\": 1676629079000,\n  \"meta\": {\n    \"createdFromSafeAddress\": \"0xcA771eda0c70aA7d053aB1B25004559B918FE662\"\n  },\n  \"transactions\": [\n    {\n      \"to\": \"0x5d4020b9261F01B6f8a45db929704b0Ad6F5e9E6\",\n      \"value\": \"0\",\n      \"data\": \"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\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n### Tenderly Simulation\n\n[Link to Tenderly simulation](https://dashboard.tenderly.co/public/safe/safe-apps/simulator/6532ab27-1ba5-45f2-a4e9-119994a294b3)",

      "content": "```\nCIP: 21\ntitle: Trading fee discount for COW token holders\nauthor: middleway.eth\nstatus: active\ncreated: 2023-02-09\n```\n\n## Simple Summary\n\nFee discounts for COW token holders were introduced in [CIP-3](https://forum.cow.fi/t/cip-3-trading-fee-discount-for-cow-holders/325), March 2022. The allocated budget  for discount is now about to get [depleted](https://dune.com/queries/529638) (59.4 ETH used out of 60 ETH budget).\n\nThis proposal is aimed to reflect on the usage of discounts so far, discuss potential changes, and propose a new budget for discounts. \n\n## Motivation\n\nTrading fee discounts are a very popular incentive mechanism used across the crypto industry by top CEXs and DEXs. At this point in time, it is one of the important use cases for the COW token, allowing users to realize some benefits already today.\n\n**Usage stats**\n\nBelow is a table sourced from [this dune query](https://dune.com/queries/1925952), showing the number of traders and the total dollar amount spent per discount tier.\n\n| discount_tier | num_traders | total_subsidy |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 0.05 | 1374 | 11217.62 |\n| 0.1 | 1305 | 74280.23 |\n| 0.2 | 226 | 19012.47 |\n| 0.4 | 17 | 7143.20 |\n\nAnother [query](https://dune.com/queries/1926022) helps us to determine the percentage of CoW Swap **trades** that enjoy a discount due to holding COW: 21% (53k out of 249k)\n\nLooking at the [net spending](https://dune.com/queries/1924159) on fee discounts per month, we see a clear decline from April, when the discount was introduced and until July 2022. Since July spending on discounts is ranging $1k-$5k per month. \n\nThose metrics indicate that the fee discount is relatively widely used by many of CoW Swap users where the majority of the budget spent on lower fee discount tiers.\n\n## Specification\n\nThe fee discount is implemented by producing a lower fee quote to orders of users that hold COW tokens. Fees are collected in the sell token and are converted to ETH at the end of every week in order to cover the execution gas cost. Implementing a fee discount just means the protocol will not fully cover the gas execution cost with the collected fees from orders submitted by COW holders. The proposed budget will be used to cover the mismatch between collected fees and gas execution cost payed out to solvers. No additional technical implementation is required. \n\nIt is proposed to allocate 50k DAI as a budget for discounts to COW token holders. If the same burn rate is maintained in the future, the new budget is estimated to last 10 months or more\n\n## Rationale\n\nIt is proposed that the required 50k DAI will be withdrawn from the treasury management safe, and converted to ETH using a milkman order with Uniswap v3 price checker using DAI-WETH 0.05% fee pool, where the destination safe is the [solver rewards safe](https://etherscan.io/address/0xA03be496e67Ec29bC62F01a428683D7F9c204930).\n\n## Safe Transaction Data\n\n```\n{\n  \"version\": \"1.0\",\n  \"chainId\": \"1\",\n  \"createdAt\": 1676570129290,\n  \"meta\": {\n    \"createdFromSafeAddress\": \"0xcA771eda0c70aA7d053aB1B25004559B918FE662\"\n  },\n  \"transactions\": [\n    {\n      \"to\": \"0x6B175474E89094C44Da98b954EedeAC495271d0F\",\n      \"value\": \"0\",\n      \"data\": null,\n      \"contractMethod\": {\n        \"inputs\": [\n          {\n            \"name\": \"spender\",\n            \"type\": \"address\"\n          },\n          {\n            \"name\": \"value\",\n            \"type\": \"uint256\"\n          }\n        ],\n        \"name\": \"approve\",\n        \"payable\": false\n      },\n      \"contractInputsValues\": {\n        \"spender\": \"0x11C76AD590ABDFFCD980afEC9ad951B160F02797\",\n        \"value\": \"50000000000000000000000\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"to\": \"0x11C76AD590ABDFFCD980afEC9ad951B160F02797\",\n      \"value\": \"0\",\n      \"data\": null,\n      \"contractMethod\": {\n        \"inputs\": [\n          {\n            \"name\": \"amountIn\",\n            \"type\": \"uint256\"\n          },\n          {\n            \"name\": \"fromToken\",\n            \"type\": \"address\"\n          },\n          {\n            \"name\": \"toToken\",\n            \"type\": \"address\"\n          },\n          {\n            \"name\": \"receiver\",\n            \"type\": \"address\"\n          },\n          {\n            \"name\": \"priceChecker\",\n            \"type\": \"address\"\n          },\n          {\n            \"name\": \"priceCheckerData\",\n            \"type\": \"bytes\"\n          }\n        ],\n        \"name\": \"requestSwapExactTokensForTokens\",\n        \"payable\": false\n      },\n      \"contractInputsValues\": {\n        \"amountIn\": \"50000000000000000000000\",\n        \"fromToken\": \"0x6B175474E89094C44Da98b954EedeAC495271d0F\",\n        \"toToken\": \"0xC02aaA39b223FE8D0A0e5C4F27eAD9083C756Cc2\",\n        \"receiver\": \"0xA03be496e67Ec29bC62F01a428683D7F9c204930\",\n        \"priceChecker\": \"0x67FE9d6bbeeccb8c7Fe694BE62E08b5fCB5486D7\",\n        \"priceCheckerData\": \"0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000063ee6e110000000000000000000000002f965935f93718bb66d53a37a97080785657f0ac000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000006000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001400000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000064000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000004000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000e0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000004000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000a000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000020000000000000000000000006b175474e89094c44da98b954eedeac495271d0f000000000000000000000000c02aaa39b223fe8d0a0e5c4f27ead9083c756cc200000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000010000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000005\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n```\n\n### Tenderly Simulation\n\n[Link to Tenderly simulation](https://dashboard.tenderly.co/public/safe/safe-apps/simulator/2bd92d56-71cb-473e-8925-c28e9f509508)\n(Simulation fails because there's not enough DAI balance in the CoW DAO safe, this will change after the DAI is withdrawn from the treasury management safe)\n\nAnother [tenderly simulation](https://dashboard.tenderly.co/public/safe/safe-apps/simulator/5978d720-a286-4527-8be9-8d13bb73aed1) with state override, that is simulating successfully ",

      "content": "```\nCIP: 20\ntitle: Auction model for solver rewards\nauthor: @felixhenneke, @harisang\nstatus: active\ncreated: 2023-01-16\nreplaces: CIP 14\n```\n\n## Simple Summary:\n\nWe propose an auction based mechanism for rewarding winners of the solver competition.\n\nCurrently, the winner of the solver competition is rewarded an amount of COW token based on the orders that are included in their solution. This per-order rewards model does not take into account general market conditions or how difficult it was to find a solution. It therefore requires constant readjustment and it does not incentivize research into tackling challenging batches, e.g., utilizing the value of CoWs.\n\nThe proposed auction mechanism allows for dynamically finding a reward based on how much value a solver provides to users by settling a batch. This results in a distribution of rewards better aligned with goals of the protocol, solvers, and users.\n\n## Motivation\n\nThe current reward scheme for the solver competition is based on risk adjusted rewards on a per-order basis as described in [CIP-14](https://forum.cow.fi/t/cip-14-risk-adjusted-solver-rewards/1132/30).\n\nThere are several issues with the current model:\n\n* It is parameterized by an ad-hoc minimum reward of 37 COW per order.\n* It is oblivious to how easy it is to detect the best execution (thin vs thick competition). Auctions with multiple identical submitted solutions are rewarded the same as auctions with only one valid solution.\n* It does not (as much as it should) reward innovation and taking advantage of CoWs and structurally better solutions (e.g., detecting CoWs vs execution with touching the same pool multiple times).\n* It is oblivious to the volume of an order and the particular pairs traded.\n\nUltimately, the current model is quite static, does not directly take protocol viability into consideration, and is not adaptive enough to the ever-changing competition landscape.\n\nThe proposed reward mechanism results in an improvement of all those issues. It also requires some changes in the behavior of solvers. We will discuss those after the specification of the mechanism.\n\n## Specification\n\nPer-auction rewards are computed using a second-price auction mechanism for the quality of solutions:\n\n1. Each solver commits to a score and a solution.\n2. The winner is the solver with the highest score.\n3. The winner gets to settle the auction on chain, and is payed\n`payment = cap( observedQuality - referenceScore )`.\n\nHere, the observed quality is `observedQuality = observedSurplus + observedFee`, as executed on chain. The reference score is the second highest submitted score. The uncapped payment of `observedQuality - referenceScore` is capped from above and below using the function `cap(x) = max(-c, min(c + observedCost, x))` with a cap `c` of `0.01 ETH`.\n\nSubmitted scores have to be positive. We note that the (protocol-submitted) empty solution, having a zero score, will always be considered in the ranking. This implies that an auction with only one submitted solution (from a solver) can still get rewarded (the referenceScore in this case is zero).\n\nThe observed quality is zero if the settlement is not successfully submitted to the blockchain. This can be, e.g., due to a revert of the transaction or because the transaction was not successfully settled in time (current limit is 2 minutes).\n\nThe payment described above can be decomposed into a reward and a gas reimbursement. In the case of a successful settlement, the gas reimbursement is equal to `observedCost` of the settlement, while the reward is `payment - observedCost` which is equal to `min(observedQuality - observedCost - referenceScore, c)`. For a failed transaction, the gas reimbursement is zero and the reward is negative and equal to `max(-c, -referenceScore)`, in which case the winning solver would have to pay the reward to the protocol. As before, gas reimbursements are payed in ETH while rewards are paid in COW, using an up to date COW price.\n\nThe protocol commits to spend 20_000_000 COW tokens per year i.e. around 383307 COW per week on rewards. If at the end of an accounting period (currently: a week) the total amount of performance based rewards to be paid to solvers is smaller than the amount committed to by the protocol, the remaining sum is distributed to solver teams which consistently provide solutions. Those rewards will be distributed pro-rate to solvers based on the number of auctions they submitted a valid solution for over the accounting period.\n\nThe capping of performance based rewards is chosen such that the total rewards for all solvers amount to around 15_000_000 COW tokens per year (see section on experiments). This is comparable to the rewards payed to solvers in Nov-Jan. The remaining COW tokens of the total allocation of 20_000_000 COW are rewarded based on consistency. The cap of 0.01ETH will be adjusted one time after 4 weeks of using the new reward scheme. If the amount of rewards payed in that period extrapolates to significantly more than 15_000_000 COW per year, the cap will be decreased. If the amount of rewards payed in that period extrapolates to significantly less than 15_000_000 COW per year, the cap will be increased.\n\nWe will monitor the additional constraint `score < observedQuality` for submitted scores and add this rule to the social consensus rules.\n\n## Implications for solvers\n\nWith the new reward mechanism solver teams would have to submit not only their solution but also a score. The score can be interpreted as expected quality - expected costs. A profit maximizing solver would maximize their score, which in turn would mean that they maximize expected quality - expected costs. The second-price mechanism means that solvers would truthfully report this expectation.\n\nThe change of the reward mechanism will thus require solvers to adapt their strategy a bit: Instead of just maximizing quality - costs they now explicitly have to take into account revert risks. This moves complexity to solvers, as proper risk management is going to be required to be profitable.\n\nThe new reward scheme does not by itself enforce maximizing surplus of users. This is because in the score computation a smaller surplus of a solution can be compensated by a smaller cost e.g. due to positive slippage. We want to avoid the situation of solvers decreasing surplus and will therefore monitor and enforce EBBO (Ethereum’s Best Bid and Offer) rules more strictly, see the social consensus rules in [CIP-11](https://forum.cow.fi/t/cip-11-rules-of-the-solver-competition-status-quo-and-an-update-proposal/1016).\n\n## Transitioning period\n\nSolvers have to learn to submit scores, e.g., by having a model for revert risk and costs. Therefore we propose a transitioning period for the new reward mechanism along the following lines:\n\n1. Two weeks for a dry run of the new scheme where solvers can optionally submit either a `score` or a `scoreDicount` (at most one of the two values). All solutions are simulated and only successfully simulated solutions are considered. If a `scoreDiscount` is submitted, the driver computes a score as `score = simulatedSurplus + simulatedFees - simulatedCost - scoreDiscount`. Solutions are still ranked and rewarded by the **old scheme**. Solvers can see how they *would have been* ranked and rewarded using the new scheme.\n\tThis period will start on 28.2.2023 and with weekly payments computed on 7.3.2023 and 14.3.2023.\n2. Four weeks of using the new scheme in production where submitting either a `score` or a `scoreDiscount` (exactly one of the two values) is mandatory. The ranking of solutions and rewards are computed using the **new scheme**. This period is used to observe the competition and the effect of capping. If rewards are significantly smaller than expected the cap is increased. If rewards are significantly larger than expected the cap is reduced.\n\tThis period starts on 14.3.23 with the first payment to solvers taking place on the 21.3.2023.\n3. After that period, the submission of a `score` becomes mandatory. This period starts on the 11.04.2023 with the first payment being on the 18.04.2023.\n\n## Experiments on historical data\n\nThe new reward scheme has been tested on historical auction data from October to January. Using the proposed scheme, the capping of rewards was chosen such that rewards are close to 41068 COW per day, corresponding to 15_000_000 COW per year, with a fixed exchange rate of 0.00005 ETH/COW. For October-January:\n\n![rewards_vs_cap_oct-jan.png](ipfs://bafkreihm3gefietcj7xmwu3ytu3ojlsklbhl572tfgyfgxuvoasjnwwhlm)\n\nIn the time period November-January the proposed scheme results in the following rewards for the individual solvers (blue: scheme old, yellow: new scheme).\n\n![reward_solvers.png](ipfs://bafkreihp3xvdfvhddqxceocmfw4rv7r5hkvj63epp7qpphj4uwtoubrfxu)\n\nThe script and data for the experiments can be found in the Appendix. The script also contains additional information on the distribution of rewards, profits, and payments per auction and per solver.\n\n## Appendix\n\nThe script and data for testing the new scheme on historical data can be found here:\n\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/11BgbOYLgfel60zO5FXWySCd8AmzFck4X/view?usp=share_link\n\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1AXxn2BtfcY4kaG0-lmkQr8gsBovhqoyV/view?usp=share_link\n\nA lot of parties contributed to the ideas and formulation of this CIP-Draft.

      "title": "CIP-19: Karpatkey DAO Proposal to Create a Core Treasury Team",
      "content": "```\nCIP: 19\ntitle: Karpatkey DAO Proposal to Create a Core Treasury Team\nauthor: @Karpatkey, @elbagococina, @DefiFoodie.eth, middleway.eth\nstatus: Active\ncreated: 2022-12-05\n```\n\n## Karpatkey Proposal: Create a Core Treasury Team\n\n## Simple Summary\n\nThis is a proposal to have KarpatkeyDAO create, train, support, and audit a Core Treasury Team within CoW DAO that would work jointly with KarpatkeyDAO to develop CoW DAO’s treasury, allowing CowSwap to efficiently provide its own liquidity, fund its operations, development, and evolution while optimising yield for idle funds.\n\n\n## Motivation\n\nAdequately managing a DAO’s treasury is time-consuming, requiring several hours a day of research to ensure that tokens are utilised in the best possible way. An idle treasury has a significant cost of opportunity. Therefore, delegating the administration of the treasury to a professional non-custodial treasury management DAO such as Karpatkey would optimise its growth with a carefully curated strategy with controlled risk.\n\nEven though we can’t promise results, we can show our past performance as advisors for Gnosis DAO’s treasury when our goal was to obtain a sustainable growth of funds with low exposure to risk (before shifting to maximising the growth of the Gnosis Chain). As the chart illustrates, the yield obtained by Karpatkey’s strategies was greater than that of the 65 largest DAOs in the ecosystem.\n\nWe achieved those results while looking after the runway, taking care of providing enough liquidity to face all of Gnosis’ obligations, covering all operating expenses and funding every single approved Gnosis Improvement Proposal:\n\nThe following chart displays Karpatkey’s 2022 YTD performance.\n\n## Specification\n\nWe will create, train, support and audit a Core Treasury Team that will work jointly with us to carry out several treasury-related tasks. Its initial goal will be to provide enough liquidity to secure Cow DAO’s runway.\n\nIn order to be able to fund Cow DAO’s operation adequately, an initial analysis will be carried out to determine the organisation’s expenditure needs, including the following:\n\n* Solver execution costs\n* CoW Grants Program\n* Monthly payments to contributors\n\nPayments will be forecasted in a timeline which will be used as input for the liquidity needs analysis. Once the necessary liquidity has been secured, the rest of the funds will be grown following our yield strategy.\n\nRegarding the tasks, CoW DAO will set up a new Safe multi-signature wallet with a 3 out of X setup, where Karpatkey will only have 2 signatures (insufficient to execute any transactions) and CoW DAO’s Core Treasury Team members will have at least 3 signatures. Therefore, the funds will be accessible to CoW DAO at all times, without any need for KarpatkeyDAO’s intervention. \\\nKarpatkey will assist CoW DAO in bootstrapping its liquidity and optimising the yield for its idle funds by suggesting a series of strategies tailored to suit CoW DAO’s needs and risk profile.\n\nExecution meetings will be held with the participation of KarpatkeyDAO and CoW DAO’s trusted signers from the Core Treasury Team, where the strategy drafted periodically by Karpatkey’s Financial Engineering team will be carried out. A tight security protocol provided by Karpatkey will be observed during those meetings.\n\nKarpatkeyDAO’s goals are the following:\n\n* Design and implement an efficient and robust treasury management system\n* Identify the best economic opportunities for the treasury tokens\n* Facilitate COW liquidity\n \\\nTo align with CowSwap’s vision and ethos and increase transparency with COW token holders, we propose making information about investments available to the CoW DAO community. The treasury would be handled in a completely transparent way, positively impacting CoW DAO’s reputation and trustworthiness.\n\n### Reporting\n\nKarpatkeyDAO will provide a weekly report and support in identifying data elements upon request from CoW DAO’s community. Also, KarpatkeyDAO would review the data reported and assist in performing analytics and quality reviews to confirm the accuracy of the data.\n\n\n## Karpatkey’s Organisation Structure\n\nKarpatkey is organised into different teams, as shown in the following org chart.\n\n#### Defi Ops & Research\n\n\n##### Research & Strategy\n\nThey constantly monitor the market, comprehensively analysing existing and emerging protocols for financial viability and security. After the conclusion of each analysis, the team drafts the execution strategy and submits it to the execution team.\n\n\n##### Operations\n\nThis team carries out the execution strategy during periodically held videoconferences, abiding by a strict security protocol audited by [Cipherblade](http://www.cipherblade.com). They ensure that the underlying reasons behind each transaction are met before execution, checking that price impact, impermanent loss, liquidity, yield and other parameters are within range. At least one trusted signer from the client must participate in each meeting to approve every transaction.\n\n\n##### Financial Engineering\n\nThey put together periodic reports to show the state of the treasury and the performance of all positions so that its health and growth can be constantly monitored. Also, they check existing positions where tokens have been allocated on a daily basis, to determine if they are still the best ones to suit the strategy, tailored to the client’s goals and risk profile.  \n\n\n#### Technology\n\n\n##### DevOps\n\nThis team is responsible for the setup and maintenance of infrastructure, nodes, routers, bridges and keepers.\n\n\n##### Development\n\nThey create and improve the code of the dApps and modules that we use to sustainably scale our operations, increasing capital efficiency and security through audited automations which are comprehensively tested before deployment.\n\n\n#### Support & Staff\n\n\n##### Legal & Compliance\n\nThis team continuously monitors the regulations that apply to every activity in which KarpatkeyDAO takes part, ensuring compliance. They also follow the legislative trends to be proactively prepared to abide by potential future regulations. \n\n\n##### HR\n\nThey encompass HR planning, recruiting, compensation and benefits, training and development.\n\n\n## Rationale\n\nKarpatkeyDAO will design an efficient strategy to get the most out of the treasury, protecting it and making it readily accessible to CoW DAO to fund its operations and growth. We will analyse the instruments available in the market to obtain a yield from the tokens held in the treasury. \\\n**Liquidity and Risk Management:** The fundamental goal is not to lose principal. No token allocation should be so risky that CoW DAO cannot recover the initial investment. This is particularly important in short-term scenarios where token liquidity is essential to cover OPEX and tokens are allocated for a short time to gain income.\n\n**Planned/Unplanned Funding Needs:** It should be easy to convert positions where tokens are allocated into cash on little notice. Enough positions need to satisfy a short-term operational need for funding, even if it was not planned/forecasted. This combines the liquidity analysis of each position with the consideration of potential secondary markets for illiquid positions and the creation of a predefined strategy that determines the order in which positions should be liquidated in the event of an emerging funding need. \\\nThis strategy would complement an emergency withdrawal strategy to derisk/liquidate/swap all positions in the event of a market crash, hack or any fortuitous event that requires to stop loss.\n\n**Earn a return:** Once enough runway to face a contingency and a bear market has been secured, Karpatkey will seek to optimise the return on token allocation.\n\n\n## Fees\n\nKarpatkeyDAO will charge the following fees:\n\n\n### Management fee\n\nA yearly management fee (in monthly instalments) of 0.5% of the NAUM (non-custodial assets under management) will be charged to finance the services detailed above. This fee will be due in arrears, payable in the first week following each month’s close.\n\n\n### Performance fee\n\nA monthly performance fee of 10% of the yield obtained during the last month will be collected 100% in COW tokens. \n\n\n## Termination\n\nCoW DAO may terminate KarpatkeyDAO’s engagement under this agreement for any reason by way of the Governance Mechanism. KapatkeyDAO may terminate this agreement upon four weeks' notice posted as a new discussion thread in the CoW DAO forum. In case the termination is requested by Cow DAO without at least a four-week notice, KarpatkeyDAO will be granted an exit fee equal to the fees collected during the last two months, which will be paid in DAI or USDC. Regular fees will be collected until the day of termination.\n\n\n## Custody of Funds\n\nKarpatkeyDAO is not a custodian of funds. CoW DAO will never transfer any funds to KarpatkeyDAO wallets, except for fees. The funds will be in possession of CoW DAO at all times. The positions can be disassembled by CoW DAO at any time. \n\nKarpatkeyDAO will sign transactions using two addresses.\n\nLikewise, KarpatkeyDAO is not responsible for loss of funds caused by the existence, identification and/or exploitation of vulnerabilities through hacks, mining attacks (including double-spend attacks, majority mining power attacks and “selfish-mining” attacks), sophisticated cyber-attacks, distributed denials of service or other security breaches, attacks or deficiencies with smart contracts or protocols which are not owned by Cow DAO or KarpatkeyDAO.\n\nThe plans outlined in this proposal are subject to discussion by CowDAO and may need to be (re)structured to account for legal, regulatory, or technical developments as well as governance considerations. This document should not be taken as the basis for making investment decisions nor be construed as a recommendation to engage in any transactions.\n\n## **Implementation**\nIt is proposed the new Gnosis Safe deployed at [0x616dE58c011F8736fa20c7Ae5352F7f6FB9F0669](https://app.safe.global/eth:0x616dE58c011F8736fa20c7Ae5352F7f6FB9F0669/settings/setup) as a **Treasury Management Safe** with the following setup:\nSignature threshold: 3 out of 6\nSigners:\n2x Karpatkey DAO\n- 0x1E4AA69007611DeFc0Ed784e917895e050568bf4\n- 0x53D2C6dd3A3282CF63972Ccb668A97D100bd086a\n\n2x CoW Treasury management team (core team)\n- 0xbF0E648E4e1E73ab067D10bc73D029519a26a952\n- 0x927CBc6A90080068cF839d27000E13355870c825\n\n2x Backup signers from CoW DAO existing Safe\n- 0xf10Fe968d1856131FC6835ed7d7126eaF8b5a6b6\n- 0x04ce1ccF81AE660e23ca0c0823911df709B0E7Fc\n\nFunds proposed to be transferred and managed by the Treasury Safe:\n* DAI: 803k (GC)\n* GNO: 536 (GC) + 13,265 (Mainnet)\n* ETH: 187 (Mainnet)\n* USDC: 2.2M (Mainnet)\n* COW: 8M (Mainnet)\n\n## Safe Transaction Data\n\nThe payload is included in the following tenderly simulations:\n[Tenderly 1](https://dashboard.tenderly.co/public/safe/safe-apps/simulator/62f991bc-3553-4e4f-880a-6980b48f80ec)\n[Tenderly 2](https://dashboard.tenderly.co/public/safe/safe-apps/simulator/c242c432-bd18-42ac-a8c3-55b2302909c9)\n[Tenderly 3](https://dashboard.tenderly.co/public/safe/safe-apps/simulator/199ab959-227e-417a-a596-e3c7872a5a84)\n\nThe proposed transaction should:\n* Send all funds from CoW DAO mainnet to new Treasury management Safe\n* Send dedicated amount of USDC from KYC sub-safe to Treasury management Safe\n* On Gnosis Chain: bridge relevant funds to mainnet Treasury management Safe\n\n## **Snapshot**\nLink to be provided.",

      "content": "```\nCIP: 18\ntitle: CoW Grants Program Renewal Proposal\nauthor: netrunner.eth, middleway.eth\nstatus: Active\ncreated: 2022-12-13\n```\n\n## **Summary - Renewal of the CoW Grants Program (CGP)**\nWe are excited to launch this CIP to seek community support to renew the [CoW Grants Program](https://grants.cow.fi/). \n\nThis program is an essential resource for advancing the CoW Protocol ecosystem and it will help improve the utility of $COW tokens and facilitate deeper integration with other DeFi solutions. \n\nIn June 2022, the CoW Grants Program was established through [CIP-8](https://snapshot.org/#/cow.eth/proposal/0xdc641be107f139753cea051f1bacb8b74b915713a95306c3994f5e03e20d6bef). Now, we look forward to continuing the program seeking community support to renew it for 12 months.\n\n## **Motivation**\nThe CoW Grants Program is committed to helping grow the CoW Protocol's ecosystem, having reviewed and funded many applications with more on the way. \n\nThese contributions include analytics, tooling, UI/UX, infrastructure and growth projects. We are also beginning to see integrations with other well-known organisations like [Yearn](https://yearn.finance/), [Shapeshift](https://shapeshift.com/) and [Defi Llama](https://defillama.com/) – positive signs that the program is making great progress! \n\nThere are few places to follow the Grants Program progress:\n\n* Grants Program [forum section](https://forum.cow.fi/c/cow-grants-program/10)\n* [Airtable](https://airtable.com/shrfR2hI0JBMdPfTt/tblunA5vCNXl3ev5d) including grant status\n* [Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ekDHat-H4Jss0U4Qh0CLiL_ngaT1JStec8KtZ0kJpAw/edit#gid=0) for tracking payments from the [Grants Safe](https://app.safe.global/gno:0xCA1F000D520c21C47E6c634DD31b92b91A6338bD/home)\n* Grants Program [Sanpshot space](https://snapshot.org/#/cowgrants.eth) (newly introduced so doesn't include past grants)\n\nThe Grants Program has processed payments for grants in the total sum of\n* 106,640 xDAI\n* 190,100 COW\n\nThere are also pending obligations (conditional to milestones delivery):\n* ZeroMEV data API: 15k xDAI\n* Shapeshift integration: 5k xDAI, 400k COW\n* Golang SDK: 5k xDAI\n* Surplus capturing AMMs study: 21k xDAI, 150k COW\n* TWAP orders (SC): 10k xDAI\n* Ongoing stipend and contributors: On a monthly basis\n\n## Volume-based Partner Reward Program\nThis idea was pioneered in the [Shapeshift Integration Grant](https://forum.cow.fi/t/grant-proposal-cowswap-shapeshift-integration). The model is straightforward and effective for both CoW DAO and its partners. Rewards are based on actual performance, creating incentives for driving more volume to the CoW Protocol, as well as giving partners exposure to the COW token. \n\nOver the term of this 12 month grants program, we intend to gather information on what an economically sustainable expense would be to acquire new users (volume). We believe that a tailored partner reward program is a good way to test these kinds of collaborations before a general open program can be implemented. \n\nBaseline deal:\n\n```\nFirst $10M volume: 60k $COW\nAdditional $50M volume: 120k COW\nAdditional $200M volume: 240k COW\n\nVolume milestones must be surpassed within 12 months to be eligible for funding.\nAll COW tokens granted will be subject to 12 months of vesting.\n```\n\n- Baseline numbers for the purpose of this proposal are open for public discussion. \n- Once the proposal is approved, the committee should not approve a partner deal with higher rewards per volume and per partner.\n\n# Grants Committee\n**Committee Members**\nThe [CoW Grants Comittee](https://forum.cow.fi/t/grants-committee-members/1013) is comprised of seven members - three from the core team and four from the community. Four community members receive a stipend. \n\n**Stipend**\nAt the beginning of the program, community Grant Committee Members received a stipend of approximately $750 USD per month. However, due to a decline in the price of $COW, we propose an increase in the stipend from 5,000 COW (~$350 USD) to 8,000 COW (~$600 USD), with an additional $150 difference being paid in $XDAI. We believe that this adjustment is fitting considering the decline in $COW prices and the responsibility for executing the Grants Program entrusted to us by $COW token holders.\n\n**Technical grants lead**\nThe previous 6 months grant program has also highlighted that reviewing highly technical grants needs a dedicated resource to do the following:\n- **Grantee assessment:** Assess the grantee's capabilities to finish the grant;\n- **Technical review:** Review technical specifications and conduct feasibility studies on Grant Proposals to assess the Grantee's aptitude to execute, making sure these align with CoW Protocol's development and standards;\n- **Evaluate results:** Assess technical milestones before payments are given by the Committee. \n\nTherefore, we propose that should this CIP be approved, Grants DAO will create a technical grant lead role to perform these core tasks.\n\n**Grants Program Term**\nThe Cow Grants Program will be a rolling 12 month arrangement, with annual renewals approved by CoW DAO.\n\n## **Specification**\n**Budget**\nThe budget for general purpose grants is proposed to be increased by 1.5M $COW and 500k $XDAI, in addition to existing funds on the [Grants DAO Funds Safe](https://app.safe.global/gno:0xDA00000B30dCf0C3f5d968e4451Ebdee6950d63e/balances). It is proposed that funds will be requested and bridged as tranche payments as required. This will ensure Grants DAO can meet current and future grant commitments while maintaining capital efficiency. \n\n**New Safe**\nThe Grants Committee proposes the establishment of a new Multisig Safe, separate from the Grants Safe, but still operated by the Grants Committee. This new Safe [was already created](https://app.safe.global/gno:0xbD96C4Fe53f1d89a8Bdb3522BCEDfB20b5601b69/home) with the exact same setup as the [Grants Funds Safe](https://app.safe.global/gno:0xDA00000B30dCf0C3f5d968e4451Ebdee6950d63e/home), to be used if this proposal passes. It'll be used to operate the proposed **Volume-based Partner Reward Program** with a narrower mandate to only approve and pay performance-based rewards. It is proposed that this Safe will be funded with 3M COW tokens exclusively for this purpose.\n\n## Safe Transaction Data\n\n```\n{\n   \"version\":\"1.0\",\n   \"chainId\":\"1\",\n   \"createdAt\":1673613134179,\n   \"meta\":{\n      \"name\":\"Transactions Batch\",\n      \"description\":\"\",\n      \"txBuilderVersion\":\"1.11.1\",\n      \"createdFromSafeAddress\":\"0xcA771eda0c70aA7d053aB1B25004559B918FE662\",\n      \"createdFromOwnerAddress\":\"\",\n      \"checksum\":\"0xb927b18c1f3b5fc551e49da277b88fdcf10e81d543604648cdac9b9803edacbd\"\n   },\n   \"transactions\":[\n      {\n         \"to\":\"0xDEf1CA1fb7FBcDC777520aa7f396b4E015F497aB\",\n         \"value\":\"0\",\n         \"data\":null,\n         \"contractMethod\":{\n            \"inputs\":[\n               {\n                  \"internalType\":\"address\",\n                  \"name\":\"spender\",\n                  \"type\":\"address\"\n               },\n               {\n                  \"internalType\":\"uint256\",\n                  \"name\":\"amount\",\n                  \"type\":\"uint256\"\n               }\n            ],\n            \"name\":\"approve\",\n            \"payable\":false\n         },\n         \"contractInputsValues\":{\n            \"spender\":\"0x88ad09518695c6c3712AC10a214bE5109a655671\",\n            \"amount\":\"3000000000000000000000000\"\n         }\n      },\n      {\n         \"to\":\"0x88ad09518695c6c3712AC10a214bE5109a655671\",\n         \"value\":\"0\",\n         \"data\":null,\n         \"contractMethod\":{\n            \"inputs\":[\n               {\n                  \"internalType\":\"contract IERC677\",\n                  \"name\":\"token\",\n                  \"type\":\"address\"\n               },\n               {\n                  \"internalType\":\"address\",\n                  \"name\":\"_receiver\",\n                  \"type\":\"address\"\n               },\n               {\n                  \"internalType\":\"uint256\",\n                  \"name\":\"_value\",\n                  \"type\":\"uint256\"\n               }\n            ],\n            \"name\":\"relayTokens\",\n            \"payable\":false\n         },\n         \"contractInputsValues\":{\n            \"token\":\"0xDEf1CA1fb7FBcDC777520aa7f396b4E015F497aB\",\n            \"_receiver\":\"0xbD96C4Fe53f1d89a8Bdb3522BCEDfB20b5601b69\",\n            \"_value\":\"3000000000000000000000000\"\n         }\n      }\n   ]\n}\n```\nThe proposed transaction is bridging 3m COW tokens to the newly created safe on Gnosis Chain for Volume-based partner program.

      "content": "```\nCIP: 17\ntitle: Making slippage symmetric\nauthor: harisang\ncreated: 2022-12-07\n```\n\n## Simple summary\n\nThis post proposes that the protocol treats slippage incurred by solvers symmetrically; in the case of negative slippage, a solver would be penalized with an amount equal to the negative slippage incurred (as is the case now), while in the case of positive slippage, the protocol would reimburse the solver with an amount equal to the positive slippage generated.\n\n## Motivation\n\nSlippage management in CoW Protocol is the sole responsibility of solvers. A settlement can incur slippage as follows: the winning solution reports the uniform clearing price vector, which locks prices at the moment the winning solver is chosen. However, from the moment the winner is picked offchain until the moment the winning solution is mined onchain, several seconds might pass and in the meantime, there can be market shifts. Thus, a solution that expects a certain amount of tokens to be returned by an AMM interaction might end up receiving less, or more, from that AMM interaction. The case where the settlement contract receives more is a case of \"positive\" slippage for the solver, while the case where the settlement contract receives less, and thus has to use some of its own internal buffers to cover the difference, is a case of \"negative\" slippage for the solver.\n\nThe protocol tracks all instances of slippage on a per solver basis, and during each week's payout, it accounts for all positive and negative slippage each solver incurred, and aggregates this into a single value for each solver which we call *weekly net slippage*. This weekly net slippage is computed by converting all token imbalances to ETH, by using the price with respect to ETH of each token involved at a slippage settlement, where the price is estimated around the time the settlement took place. [Here](https://dune.com/queries/970879/1681580) is an example query demonstrating how slippage is computed and aggregated; we clarify that these queries are being improved over time so we propose that the latest version of such a query is used for the slippage accounting. Weekly net slippage is always denominated in ETH, and can be either positive, zero, or negative.\n\nIn each week's payout (currently taking place on Tuesdays each week), the solvers that end up with a negative weekly net slippage are penalized by this negative slippage value (i.e., they pay this amount back to the protocol) while solvers that end up with positive weekly net slippage do not gain anything, and the slippage accounting is reset. This means that in the case where solvers have positive net slippage, this is not paid out to them and it also cannot be used to balance out potential future negative slippage, so from the solver's perspective, it is lost.\n\nIn other words, slippage is currently treated asymmetrically. One of the reasons this was set up in such a way is because slippage in any case is inherently stochastic, so solvers would, more or less, see a net slippage close to zero if they settle enough batches; i.e., on expectation, net slippage should be close to zero. This means that solvers would most likely not view slippage as a source of consistent profit.\n\nHowever, this asymmetry also creates some issues.\n\n1. As we move towards a more decentralized stage of the competition, having this asymmetry in slippage is a decentralization barrier, as the protocol interferes with what would otherwise be fully managed by each solver, separately. A counter-argument for this is that there is inherent risk with accumulating slippage in tons of different tokens and then aggregating this to a single ETH value; in particular, in the weekly accounting, positive slippage in a random token can balance out negative slippage in ETH, which means that the protocol accepts the risk of treating all tokens in a uniform way. Nevertheless, we believe that making slippage symmetric and thus allowing solvers to fully manage and own their net slippage is one step towards the right direction.\n\nWe note here that solvers can already fully own the slippage they generate/suffer, by using an intermediate contract that will be responsible for executing all AMM/liquidity interactions (and there is at least one solver already implementing this strategy). However, this adds some gas overhead, and until the competition reaches a stage where each solver will have their own separate contract, we think that the protocol should allow solvers to fully own their positive slippage.\n\n2. From an external point of view, a case could be made that the protocol attempts to profit, whenever possible, from the positive slippage that solvers might generate; however, this is not in the protocol's intentions.\n\n3. A solver that has accumulated significant positive slippage might be tempted to aggressively spend it, by setting, for example, very loose slippage tolerances in order to avoid reverts. However, we do not believe this adds any real value to the protocol, on average it does not benefits users and in most cases simply results in overspending and sloppy slippage management. This can be made worse by the fact that slippage accounting is reset each week, so positive slippage cannot be used to balance out potential negative slippage across different weeks. \n\nIn other words, this limited time window in which slippage is accounted for can potentially skew the distribution of slippage and not make it centered around zero, which can incentivize solvers in the wrong ways. Since doing payouts and accounting regularly is a practical necessity, making slippage symmetric completely removes the distortion that a limited time horizon might create.\n\n**Positive slippage in the past 3 months**\n\nTo get an idea of how much positive slippage was kept in the protocol, we checked positive slippage generated by solvers during a 12-week period (September 22- November 22), and it turns out it is **23.368 ETH**. Data was collected using [this](https://dune.com/queries/970879/1681580?StartTime_d83555=2022-11-22+00%3A00%3A00&EndTime_d83555=2022-11-29+00%3A00%3A00) query, that is used for the weekly slippage accounting.\n\nA more detailed weekly breakdown is the following:\n\n* Sep 6-13:           +0.572\n* Sep 13-20:        +0.990\n* Sep 20-27:        +2.569\n* Sep 27-Oct 4:   +0.470\n* Oct 4-11:           +0.009\n* Oct 11-18:          +2.975\n* Oct 18-25:         +1.597\n* Oct 25-Nov 1:   +0.258\n* Nov 1-8:            +2.625\n* Nov 8-15:           +8.049  (FTX hacker trades)\n* Nov 15-22:         +1.521\n* Nov 22-29:        +1.733\n\n\n## Specification\n\nWe propose that we remove this asymmetry and make slippage treatment completely symmetric, as we believe that the benefits far outweigh the risks. In particular, using the slippage accounting methods that are already used in the protocol, solvers should be reimbursed for positive slippage while they should be penalized (as they are, now) for negative slippage. In the case of negative slippage, the protocol would deduct the slippage amount in ETH from the gas reimbursements (as it is the case now), while in the case of positive slippage, the protocol would send this positive slippage, measured in ETH, in the rewards address of each solver, along with the COW rewards sent each week.\n\n## Rationale \n\nThere were a few options regarding the implementation of this proposal. For example, the protocol could decide to not pay out positive slippage, but instead keep accounting of the positive slippage for larger time windows (and not just weekly ones). However, we believe that this might still create wrong incentives for solvers, as positive slippage would still not be fully owned by them. Thus, we propose that positive slippage is explicitly payed to solvers, and the simplest way to do this is by sending the corresponding ETH amount to the solver rewards addresses, so that solvers have full control over it.",

allocated to CoW DAO's [main Safe](https://gnosis-safe.io/app/eth:0xcA771eda0c70aA7d053aB1B25004559B918FE662/home) as well as any other Safe operated on behalf of CoW DAO.\nIn addition to claiming, it is proposed that all claimed tokens will be delegated to cowguardian.eth to enable CoW DAOs participation in the Safe governance.\n\n## Motivation\n\nOn September 28th, SafeDAO and Safe Token were launched.\nCoW DAO heavily relies on the Safe security, and and as a community we believe that the Safe is a critical infrastructure to unlock ownership through a smart contract account standard.\nThis proposal will allow the CoWmunity to have its voice in the Safe governance and will signal our intention to collaborate on the vision of ownership coupled with safe and fair trading.

      "content": "## Simple Summary\nThis CIP asks that CoW DAO becomes the official owner of the Solver Bond (0x5d4020b9261F01B6f8a45db929704b0Ad6F5e9E6) and reimburses Nomev Labs USDC 500,000, and reimburse the funding wallet $COW 1,500,000. Nomev Labs will continue to be responsible for running the bonding pool.\n\n## Motivation\nFollowing the approval of CIP-7: Allowing External Solvers, the Nomev Labs Lda team (previously, “Cow Services, Lda”) proceeded to advance funds to set-up a bonding pool (wallet 0x5d4020b9261F01B6f8a45db929704b0Ad6F5e9E6), managing it on behalf of the CoW DAO.\n\nThe solver bond acts as an insurance policy for the CoW Protocol and its users against malicious behaviour of solvers. Solver competition is a crucial piece in the decentralisation of the protocol. Given that the significant capital investment for the bonding facility could create a barrier to entry, Nomev Labs advanced funds and manages the vetting and allow-listing of some solvers. Given that the operation is now running smoothly, Nomev Labs is requesting the reimbursement of this amount.\n\nThese funds were not budgeted for in CIP-6: Service Agreement. If left with the current set-up, it would increase Nomev Lab’s tax burden significantly: a contingent liability is not a tax deductible cost, raising a corporate tax liability of over to EUR 200,000, implying a reduction of near 1 month runway of the development company’s operation.\n\nAs such, this CIP asks that CoW DAO officially becomes the owner and “insurer” of this bonding pool (to remain at 0x5d4020b9261F01B6f8a45db929704b0Ad6F5e9E6), refunding the USDC 500,000.00 and $COW 1,500,000.00 back to the respective source wallets, originally transferred on 2nd of May, 2022.\n\nIt will continue to be Nomev’s obligation as part of the Service Agreement to run the bonding pool on behalf of CoW DAO.\n\n## Proposal\nThat the CoW DAO transfers the solver bond funds back to the to the funding wallets at:\n\nUSDC 500,000.00 - Wallet `0x1E93f91e38deE64339cFbED29EF6EE51D188E7fF (*)`\n$COW 1,500,000.00 - Wallet `0xca07EaA4253638D286caD71CBcEec11803F2709A`\n\nFrom the following wallets owned by CoW DAO\n\nUSDC funds - Wallet `0xA1cb7762F40318ee0260F53e15De835fF001cb7E`\n$COW funds - Wallet `0xcA771eda0c70aA7d053aB1B25004559B918FE662`\n\n(*) note that this solver pool has cUSDC to obtain interest.\n\n## Proposed transaction\n** USDC\n\n`{\n\"from\":\"0xa1cb7762f40318ee0260f53e15de835ff001cb7e\"\n\"to\":\"0x1e93f91e38dee64339cfbed29ef6ee51d188e7ff\"\n\"value\":\"500000000000\"\n}`\n\n** $COW\n\n`{\n\"from\":\"0xca771eda0c70aa7d053ab1b25004559b918fe662\"\n\"to\":\"0xca07eaa4253638d286cad71cbceec11803f2709a\"\n\"value\":\"1500000000000000000000000\"\n}`",

      "title": "CIP-14: Risk-adjusted solver rewards",
      "content": "In CoW Protocol, solvers bear the execution risk: the possibility that their solution may revert. Currently the protocol rewards solvers on average R COW tokens per order, regardless of the execution risk, even though execution risk varies between orders and depends on network volatility. In some cases, the reward may not offset execution risk, discouraging solvers from submitting solutions, and leading to orders not being processed. In other cases, solvers might be earning relatively high rewards for bearing little to no risk (see appendix for an example of a no-risk batch and an example of a batch that first reverted, incurring a large cost to the winning solver, before eventually getting mined).\n\nThe goal of this post is to introduce a method for redistributing the COW rewards across user orders so that they better reflect execution risk, but still on average be equal to a parameterizable R amount of COW.\n\nNote that this is most likely a provisional measure - it can be implemented immediately via the weekly solver payouts, and can also serve as a baseline that solvers may optionally use for pricing their solutions if we later progress towards a model where solvers bid for the right to settle the batch.\n\nEven with these adjustments we foresee that some batches will continue to pay too much or little rewards, however we believe they can significantly reduce the margin of error compared to the status quo.\n\n#### Risk-adjusted rewards\n\nOn expectation, solver profits for a user order are given by the following expression:\n\n    E(profits) = (1 - p) * rewards - p * costs\n               = (1 - p) * (rewards + costs) - costs\n\nwhere\n- p is the probability of the transaction reverting, \n- costs=gas_units * gas_price is the cost incurred if the transaction reverts, \n- rewards is the amount we reward the solver with for this order.\n\nWe would like to find rewards that on expectation give out a profit of T COW to solvers:\n\n        E(profits) = T COW\n    <-> (1 - p) * (rewards + costs) - costs = T COW\n    <-> rewards = (T COW + costs) / (1 - p) - costs\n\nSo the rewards a solver should get for an order is a function of the probability of revert and the costs of reverting:\n\n    rewards(p, costs) = (T COW + costs) / (1 - p) - costs         [1]\n\nInteresting values for T are T=0 COW, where rewards will be enough only to cover costs, and T=37 COW, the average net profit solvers are getting today for the average reward of R=73 COW (see [1] in appendix on how these values were computed).\n\n#### Computing the probability p of revert\n\nWe can model the probability of a batch to revert as a function of costs, or more concretely as a function of gas_units and gas_price, since cost is equal to the product of these two quantities:\n\n     p = 1/(1 + exp(-β - ɑ1 * gas_units - ɑ2 * gas_price)))\n\nwhere β, ɑ1, and ɑ2, are obtained by (logistic) regression. See appendix for the full analysis including the data exploration justifying the choice of these predictors, and the regression computation.\n\n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreibrzyaztijdn6xw2xncoelbo2aacsa7b7cpmdoqnlu3qycn5funvi)\n    \n\n#### Capping rewards\n\nWith this model for p, whenever the probability of revert approaches one, the risk adjusted rewards (eq. 1) goes to infinity. To account for possible model inaccuracies (training data can be too thin and noisy) we suggest to further cap the maximum amount of rewards that a solver can earn, as well as the maximum gas_units:\n\n    gas_units_capped(gas_units) = min(1250K, gas_units)\n\n    rewards_capped(p, gas_units, gas_price) = \n     = min(\n           2500 COW,\n           rewards(p, gas_units_capped(gas_units) * gas_price)\n      )\n    [2]\n\nThe cap constants were empirically selected by looking at points where rewards would blow up, on a 5-month period of data, and are further partially validated by the outcome analysis at the very end of the modeling notebook (the long version, see appendix).\n\nPictorially, this looks as follows:\n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreib5fk7avltbq6sznouy4t6khnqeiqhc7ycexqvioinpx3r2as5ck4)\n    \n#### Implementation\n\nThis proposal can be implemented by updating the driver to compute eq. [2] for every user order of every batch, and include the result in a “rewards” key for the order in the instance json file sent to the solvers. Given that the average number of orders per batch, and the gas price and gas limit distribution can be expected to change over time, the regression model will need to be recalibrated periodically. As a starting point, we propose to set T=37.\n\nNote that liquidity orders are suggested to carry no COW rewards (a liquidity order should only be included in the solution if this improves the objective function).\n\n\n#### The case of internal settlements\n\nIn the case where a settlement is (potentially) using internal buffers and zero external interactions, then the risk of revert is essentially zero. In this case, we propose that we ignore the “rewards” value specified in the input json per order. Instead, this value will be replaced by the value T (per executed user order contained in the batch); note that this is equivalent to setting p, the probability of revert, to p=0. We also clarify that liquidity orders provided in the input json that have no atomic execution, i.e., where the corresponding field “has_atomic_execution” is set to FALSE, will be treated as internal interactions. This, for example, means that a perfect CoW between a user order and such a liquidity order will be treated as a purely internal settlement, and thus, will lead to a reward of value T. As an additional example, a perfect CoW between 2 user orders is also a purely internal settlement, and  will lead to a total reward of value 2T (since 2 user orders were involved).\n\n\n#### Conclusion\nThis proposal introduces a method for distributing rewards among solvers as a function of indicators of risk of revert. Its main limitations are:\n\n- Model is sensitive to calibration period. Calibrating the model on e.g. a non volatile period and then using it in a volatile period will provide inaccurate results. Ideally, the training historic period should reflect future conditions.\n- We are not considering slippage risk, only revert risk. Our data contains different kinds of solvers and their approach to the trade-off between revert risk and slippage risk is different. \n- We are not aiming at a full model that captures probability of revert. Solvers set the slippage tolerance differently which is a huge driving factor, but this is unobservable to us.\n\nPotential extensions:\n- The DAO might wish to revise the estimated solver profit (variable T above).\n\n***\n\n#### Appendix\n\nPlease refer to the following notebooks:\n\n1.

No-risk batch: In this case, there was a single user order being settled, selling a small amount of USDC for ETH. Quasimodo (the winning solver) identified one of the baseline pools (i.e., the pools provided by the driver) as the pool to match this order, but also realized that internal buffers suffice, and so it ended up internalizing the trade. In other words, this ended up being an almost zero-risk trade (order could still be canceled), where the winning solver only needed to look at liquidity provided in the input json. Here is the settlement itself:\nhttps://etherscan.io/tx/0x1c5c3a663250a3ad6465a26381925c7263e2e637dfbfd88103280f9787f4fbaf\n\n2. High-risk batch: Example of high gas costs and volatility. In this case, there was a single user order being settled, that was selling a substantial amount of BTRFLY for USDC. The winning solver was Gnosis_Paraswap and in its first attempt to settle on-chain, the transaction reverted, incurring a cost of ~0.062 ETH. Eventually, the second attempt succeeded.

      "content": "```\nCIP: CIP-13\ntitle: Rules of the Solver Competition Update: proposal to ban pennying\nauthor: @harisang, @marco\nstatus: Voting\ncreated: 2022-09-05\n```\n\n\n**Simple summary**\n\nThis post proposes that the \"pennying\" technique utilized by multiple solvers is banned. \"Pennying\" is a technique employed by solvers in order to increase their chance of winning an auction, that involves mild manipulation of prices, effectively converting part of the COW rewards per batch into additional surplus for the users.\n\n**Motivation**\n\nAt CoW Protocol, we are aiming at achieving fair and cost-efficient trading by having a set of solvers competing to solve the [Batch Auction Problem](https://docs.cow.fi/off-chain-services/in-depth-solver-specification/the-batch-auction-optimization-problem). The rules of the competition align solvers with these goals, ultimately driving value accrual for the CoW DAO.\n\nDuring the last few weeks, it has been observed that multiple solvers participating in the solver competition apply \"pennying\" in their solutions. \"Pennying\" can be defined as the mild manipulation of clearing prices so that the surplus of a user is artificially increased by a small amount. This strategy increases the chance that a solver will win an auction, by “buying” additional surplus for the users. This additional surplus is then charged as negative slippage to solvers in the weekly accounting that CoW Protocol does. Thus, a solver is effectively converting part of the batch rewards to negative slippage (while still maintaining a positive net profit), so as to increase the chance of winning.\n\nMore details and an extensive discussion about this technique can be found in [this](https://forum.cow.fi/t/pennying-as-a-strategy-to-win-more-auctions-and-how-to-deal-with-it/1093) technical forum post.\n\nWe believe that such manipulation of prices hurts the solver competition, as it creates a race to the bottom among solvers that attempt to penny their way into winning, especially when the underlying batch is relatively simple to settle (e.g., a single-order batch). It does not create any value to the protocol, and is essentially a waste of time, money and resources for the solvers and the protocol.\n\n**Proposal**\n\nWe propose that **pennying should be banned**. Moreover, we propose that a multi-step procedure should be applied when a solver is suspected of using pennying:\n\n1. After a flag is raised (by any community member), the first step would be for the CoW Protocol team to contact the corresponding solver team, investigate specific instances, debug them and identify whether the consistent manipulation of prices, if any, was intentional or not. \n2. In the case where a problem is detected, a second step would involve providing that particular solver team with a week to fix the issue. \n3. If the problem persists after a week, then as a final step, the DAO would decide (through a voting process) about whether the solver should be slashed.",

Other expenses were postponed or settled in USDC.\n\n**This proposal asks for direct reimbursement between the two DAOs.**\n\nOf course, funding obtained to benefit Cow Services LDA as part of the CIP-6 will continue to be spent with this intention and anything not spent in March and April will be used to service the CowDAO.\n\nOnce operations run their normal course and Cow Services LDA well into operations, a summary of funds spent by the development company for the CowDAO community will be shared; rather than doing this only when funds are requested, we envision this half-yearly with the first report in September - including non budgeted costs such as a solver bond. This report, however, is outside of the scope of this CIP.\n\n## Accrued funds\n\nThe funds to be reimbursed to GnosisDAO for March and April are summarized as follows:\n\n13 core contributors - 198k DAI\nTravel for contractors (to EthAmsterdam and company-wide off-site in Portugal) - 9k DAI\nEthAmsterdam hosted event - 6k DAI\nSoftware Subscriptions - 6k kDAI\nETHcc Sponsorship package & tickets - 11k DAI",

      "content": "Based on this [forum discussion](https://forum.cow.fi/t/cip-11-rules-of-the-solver-competition-status-quo-and-an-update-proposal/1016), the proposal is to vote on adding the following to the rules of the solver competition:\n\n1. Social consensus (implicit rules)\n2. Local token conservation constraints\n\n### Proposed update #1: Social consensus\n\nThe current rules do not guarantee all aspects of desirable solver behavior, in particular with respect to the fairness of solutions. There are \"non-written\" behavioral solver rules following from CoW Protocol's mission of pioneering a fair DEX. While these other rules are not implemented in the backend, we propose that CowDAO enforces them by\n\n* transparently communicating the social consensus as to what kind of solver behavior is not allowed\n* checking settlements by solvers retrospectively\n* slashing solver bonds (via a DAO vote) in case violations to the social consensus were found\n\nFor now, we suggest to consider the following types of malicious behavior (see forum post for details):\n\n1. Provision of unfair solutions\n2. Inflation of the objective function\n3. Illegal use of internal buffers\n4. Failure to report correct transacted values for encoded transactions\n5. Other malicious behavior\n\n### Proposed update #2: local token conservation\n\nUnfair shifting of user surplus from one order to another can happen in the case where two orders are trading against external liquidity on independent trading cycles. This means that an order that was necessary for generating a certain surplus might not end up \"receiving\" it. In order to mitigate such undesirable behavior, it needs to be ensured that for every user order, no external tokens \"enter\" or \"exit\" the trading cycles that the order is part of (and consequently, no surplus can be shifted between orders on independent trading cycles). This condition is referred to \"token conservation per order\" or \"local token conservation\", and described in much greater detail in this [technical blog post](https://forum.cow.fi/t/a-token-conservation-test-for-preventing-unfair-surplus-shifting/1007).\n\nIn order to provide stronger fairness guarantees for the users, we propose to add the local token conservation constraint for all user orders to be executed to the rules of the competition and implement the corresponding check in the backend.",

      "title": "CIP-10: Top Up Solver Rewards & Modify Reward Scheme",
      "content": "\nBased on [this CIP discussion](https://forum.cow.fi/t/cip-draft-solver-rewards-funding-round-2/992) from the forum, this proposal to vote on the following two items:\n\n1. Transfer 12M COW from CoW DAO (`0xca771eda0c70aa7d053ab1b25004559b918fe662`) to the Solver Rewards safe (`0xA03be496e67Ec29bC62F01a428683D7F9c204930`) and\n\n2. Modify the reward scheme from 100 COW per batch to 50 COW per batch + 35 COW per trade. The modification to reward scheme would be made for the accounting period beginning 2022-06-21 according to the implementation drafted [here](https://github.com/cowprotocol/solver-rewards/pull/38).\n\n\nBased on a projected consumption rate of ~2M COW per month, the proposal to 12M COW is expected to fund the next 6 months of solver rewards. The modification to the reward scheme has been carefully chosen in a way that the the current average weekly issuance should remain as projected.\n\n\n# Motivation & Rationale\n\nRewarding external solver competition is crutial to the plan and aligned with the CoW DAO's goals for maximal decentralization of the protocol.\n\nIn the original proposal [CIP-2: Solver Rewards](https://snapshot.org/#/cow.eth/proposal/0x1e3e95d402477b06549d2b7f24bd941f5be4573b701aaa873e773684357c371d), the rewards were specified as 100 COW tokens per batch. This was considered a reasonable first approach to reward distribution with limited complexity that could be quickly implemented and launched. \n\nThe data presented and discussion had in the forum post indicates that this current distribution scheme does not accurately capture the risk-reward ratio for solvers in certain curcumstances; For example\n\n1. **Failed Transaction Risk**: Batches with many trades have higher likelyhood of reverting\n2. **Slippage Risk**: High value trades are more likely to incur penalty due to slippage\n\nWhile it remains to continue researching the topic of on the reward scheme incorporating slippage risk due to trade size, the proposed reconfiguration is an intermediary attempt to address failed transaction risk by shifting some of the reward toward the number of trades in the batch.\n\n\n# Transaction Details\n\nSafe Tx Hash: \n\n`0x66cd06f2b35ba210d28b5709c9cef6af2e4fb8be95a3dcca89cc12d704d39a82` \n\nHash can be [verified here](https://etherscan.io/address/0xca771eda0c70aa7d053ab1b25004559b918fe662#readProxyContract) (item 12. `getTransactionHash`) with transaction data provided below:\n\n**Safe Transaction Data:**\n\n```\nto: 0xDEf1CA1fb7FBcDC777520aa7f396b4E015F497aB\nvalue: 0\ndata: 0xa9059cbb000000000000000000000000a03be496e67ec29bc62f01a428683d7f9c20493000000000000000000000000000000000000000000009ed194db19b238c000000\noperation: 0\nsafeTxGas: 0\nbaseGas: 0\ngasPrice: 0\ngasToken: 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000\nrefundReceiver: 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000\nnonce: 3\n```\n\n[Tendery Simulation](https://dashboard.tenderly.co/public/safe/safe-apps/simulator/34b65ac8-cc6c-4665-9a73-9b7ee056f97f)",

      "title": "CIP-9: Should CowDAO renew its COW liquidity incentive program",
      "content": "## Simple Summary\n\nThe original liquidity incentive program ([CIP-4](https://forum.cow.fi/t/cip-4-cow-liquidity-incentive-program/295/21)) will end on 2022-06-19, marking 12 weeks from its launch. \nThis proposal is intended to renew incentives for liquidity providers of the COW token.\nIn light of the recent discussion, the outlined proposal contains few changes:\n1. On mainnet, it is proposed to use COW tokens for incentivizing (bribing) veBAL votes for boosing BAL rewards of the Balancer COW pools\n2. The sections for \"Protocol owned liquidity\" is removed as there are plans to propose active treasury management which could more efficiently manage liquidity positions.\n## Motivation\nDEXs are the main trading venue for the COW token. It is important to ensure that COW liquidity pools maintain a baseline of liquidity that allows trading.\nIn light of the market downturn, it is quite clear that the liquidity goals for the previous proposal were not met. Providing liquidity for COW is deemed by liquidity providers a risky endeavor that requires decent return to make it worthwhile. At the time of writing APYs on Balancer mainnet pools are 30-60% while on Swapr Gnosis Chain pools the situation is similar if taking into account carrot tokens that will not fully convert.\nCurrent state of COW liquidity pools:\n- [Balancer pool](https://app.balancer.fi/#/pool/0xde8c195aa41c11a0c4787372defbbddaa31306d2000200000000000000000181): 10,942,232 COW /   370.6 ETH (Pool value: $1,312,985)\n- [Balancer pool](https://app.balancer.fi/#/pool/0x92762b42a06dcdddc5b7362cfb01e631c4d44b40000200000000000000000182):  4,089,716 COW / 9,305.6 GNO (Pool value: $3,519,279)\n- [Swapr pool](https://swapr.eth.link/#/pools/0x177127622c4A00F3d409B75571e12cB3c8973d3c/0x6A023CCd1ff6F2045C3309768eAd9E68F978f6e1?chainId=100): (Pool value: $418,667)\n- [Swapr pool](https://swapr.eth.link/#/pools/0x177127622c4A00F3d409B75571e12cB3c8973d3c/0x9C58BAcC331c9aa871AFD802DB6379a98e80CEdb?chainId=100): (Pool value: $139,437)\n\n\nGoals for the next 12 weeks of the program:\n- Maintain the current liquidity of COW\n- Reward users who are willing to provide liquidity and take the impermanent-loss risk\n- Limit rewards to not attract speculators but mainly long term believers in COW.\n- Reasonable COW spending to not create too much sell pressure (from potential farmers)\n\n## Specification\n\n### Rewards\nCowDAO will use 750k COW tokens to establish a liquidity reward program for 12 weeks.\nThe program is proposed to incentivize few liquidity pools:\n**Mainnet**\n\n- Balancer pool: 50%COW/50%ETH\n\nCowDAO will use COW tokens to incentivize (bribe) veBAL holders and boost BAL rewards: 12 weeks of 40k-COW-per-week. \nIt is expected that boosted BAL rewards will take a week due to the voting process. For the first week an additional 30k COW direct incentive is proposed. \n\n**Gnosis Chain**\n\n- Swapr pool: 50%COW/50%ETH\n- Rewards schedule: 12 weeks of 20k-COW-per-week\n\n\n**GNO pools on Balancer and Swapr are expected be incentivized by Gnosis DAO using GNO\n\n### Implementation\n\n**Mainnet**\nAllocated COW tokens (510k COW) will be sent to a 2/3 multisig with middleway.eth, mastercow.eth and CowDAO as signers. This multisig will send 40k COW bribes every two weeks for the COW/ETH balancer pool on [Hidden Hand](https://hiddenhand.finance/balancer)\n\n**Gnosis Chain**\nDXdao will implement a reward strategy that will include base rewards and an extra performance reward in [Carrot](https://carrot.eth.limo/) tokens. It is considered to move to an 8-week campaign cycle to reduce operational overhead for LPs.\n\nAny remaining COW tokens that (for any reason) were not used for its intended purpose of rewarding COW liquidity, will be returned to CowDAO after 12 weeks. \n\nRewards will be assessed and potentially changed from bribs to direct rewards by CowDAO or multisig signers during those 12 weeks.\n\n## Execution\n\nIt is proposed to be executed by transfers of COW tokens out of CowDAO mainnet Safe:\n\n1.  510k COW to ```eth:0xa8193E38C17E879CaC6CdBB996E49bc24Ad65C7c``` - Dedicated safe for this program operations\n2.  240k COW to ```gno:0x9467dcFD4519287e3878C018c02f5670465a9003``` - Multisig on Gnosis Chain that has been used by DXdao for launching Carrot and SWPR campaigns when not through the DAO\n\n### Safe Transaction Data\n\n```\n{\n\t\"version\": \"1.0\",\n\t\"chainId\": \"1\",\n\t\"createdAt\": 1655206108177,\n\t\"meta\": {\n\t\t\"name\": \"Transactions Batch\",\n\t\t\"description\": \"\",\n\t\t\"txBuilderVersion\": \"1.8.0\",\n\t\t\"createdFromSafeAddress\": \"0xcA771eda0c70aA7d053aB1B25004559B918FE662\",\n\t\t\"createdFromOwnerAddress\": \"\",\n\t\t\"checksum\": \"0xe9bb54e4f32535084ae6ac3351a8354c2bcd2e057d1f6785c3c47591bc43dfd2\"\n\t},\n\t\"transactions\": [{\n\t\t\"to\": \"0xdef1ca1fb7fbcdc777520aa7f396b4e015f497ab\",\n\t\t\"value\": \"0\",\n\t\t\"data\": \"0xa9059cbb000000000000000000000000a8193e38c17e879cac6cdbb996e49bc24ad65c7c000000000000000000000000000000000000000000006bff27c8303182c00000\",\n\t\t\"contractMethod\": null,\n\t\t\"contractInputsValues\": null\n\t}, {\n\t\t\"to\": \"0xDEf1CA1fb7FBcDC777520aa7f396b4E015F497aB\",\n\t\t\"value\": \"0\",\n\t\t\"data\": \"0x095ea7b300000000000000000000000088ad09518695c6c3712ac10a214be5109a6556710000000000000000000000000000000000000000000032d26d12e980b6000000\",\n\t\t\"contractMethod\": {\n\t\t\t\"inputs\": [],\n\t\t\t\"name\": \"AlreadyInflated\",\n\t\t\t\"payable\": false\n\t\t},\n\t\t\"contractInputsValues\": null\n\t}, {\n\t\t\"to\": \"0x88ad09518695c6c3712AC10a214bE5109a655671\",\n\t\t\"value\": \"0\",\n\t\t\"data\": \"0xad58bdd1000000000000000000000000def1ca1fb7fbcdc777520aa7f396b4e015f497ab0000000000000000000000009467dcfd4519287e3878c018c02f5670465a90030000000000000000000000000000000000000000000032d26d12e980b6000000\",\n\t\t\"contractMethod\": {\n\t\t\t\"inputs\": [{\n\t\t\t\t\"name\": \"version\",\n\t\t\t\t\"type\": \"uint256\"\n\t\t\t}, {\n\t\t\t\t\"name\": \"implementation\",\n\t\t\t\t\"type\": \"address\"\n\t\t\t}],\n\t\t\t\"name\": \"upgradeTo\",\n\t\t\t\"payable\": false\n\t\t},\n\t\t\"contractInputsValues\": null\n\t}]\n}\n```\n[Transaction simulation](https://dashboard.tenderly.co/public/safe/safe-apps/simulator/67a48d37-0be6-4d09-aa4e-889d8a53df32)\n## Rationale\n\n- Liquidity is essential for any token.

      "title": "CIP-8: Should the CowDAO fund and initiate a grants program?",
      "content": "# CoW Protocol Grants Program (CGP)\n\n## Simple Summary\n\nThis snapshot vote is based on [this CIP discussion](https://forum.cow.fi/t/cip-draft-cowswap-grants-program-cgp/314) on the forum.\nThe purpose of this CIP is to gather support within the community to pass a vote to allow the formation of a CoW Protocol Grants Program (CGP).\nThe mission of the CGP is to provide funding to help grow the Cow Protocol ecosystem and drive utility and demand for the $COW token.\nThe primary areas of growth for the CoW Protocol under this proposal are defined as:\n-   CoWmunity Growth  \n-   User interface and User experience (UI/UX)\n-   Decentralization\n-   Solvers \n-   Dev. Tools (SDK)\n-   Other/misc.\n\nA more detailed description of each category can be found in the [CIP forum discussion](https://forum.cow.fi/t/cip-draft-cowswap-grants-program-cgp/314).\nAs a grants program is a subjective process that cannot be easily automated, the proposal calls for a committee of 6 members to review proposals and deliver an efficient, predictable process to applicants.\nThis proposal aims to formalize the creation and funding of the GrantsDAO. The first grants phase is currently specified as 6 months. The GrantsDAO would allocate a total funding of 600K xDAI and 600K COW tokens.\n\n## Motivation\nThe mission of the CGP is to provide valuable resources to help grow the CoW Protocol ecosystem. Through public discourse and inbound applications, the community will get first-hand exposure to identify and respond to the most pressing needs of the ecosystem, as well as the ability to support innovative projects expanding the capabilities of the CoW Protocol.\nBy rewarding talent early with developer incentives, bounties, and infrastructure support, the CGP acts as a catalyst for growth and helps to make CoW Protocol a hub of activity for DeFi.\n\n## Specification\nThe GrantsDAO will be managed and executed by a sub DAO (referred to as the GrantsDAO). The GrantsDAO will effectively be coordinated from a Gnosis Safe multisignature wallet (Safe #2 from the schematic). The controllers/signers of this Safe are equal to the committee members.\nFunding for the GrantsDAO is proposed to be sent to a multisignature wallet controlled by both the CowDAO and the GrantsDAO (Safe #3 from the schematic), with a 1-of-2 signature threshold. While CowDAO is not envisioned to actively get involved with GrantsDAO proposals, this setup facilitates a replacement of the GrantsDAO's committee members if CowDAO redeems such action necessary.\n\n![](https://cloudflare-ipfs.com/ipfs/QmWv3jno6gSHZFgeZSKg1FeHhWQU78KjJDFYksJKTfX9og)\n\n-   Safe #1 => CowDAO Safe (Gnosis Chain) - [View Gnosis Safe](https://gnosis-safe.io/app/gno:0xcA771eda0c70aA7d053aB1B25004559B918FE662/balances)\n-   Safe #2 => Grants committee Safe (Gnosis Chain) (5 out of 7) - [View Gnosis Safe](https://gnosis-safe.io/app/gno:0xCA1F000D520c21C47E6c634DD31b92b91A6338bD/settings/owners)\n-   3 CoW team members (specified below)\n-   4 Community members (specified below)\n-   5 out of 7 signing threshold\n-   Safe #3 => GrantsDAO Safe (Gnosis Chain) (1 out of 2) - [View Gnosis Safe](https://gnosis-safe.io/app/gno:0xDA00000B30dCf0C3f5d968e4451Ebdee6950d63e/settings/owners)\n-   This Gnosis Safe with the allocated grant funds is controlled by the CowDAO and the Grants committee. This Safe shall have a signing threshold of 1 out-of 2 where both DAOs are a signer.\n-   Owner 1 = Safe #1\n-   Owner 2 = Safe #2\n\nThe grants committee will have a distribution of 3 core team members and 4 community members, making a total of 7 committee members. Safe #2 has been already created and will function as the Grants committee Safe and has 7 signers with a signing threshold of 5 out of 7. The specified committee members:\n\n4 community members:\n-   [@netrunner.eth](https://forum.cow.fi/u/netrunner.eth) - 0xc95Fda8A94437c1B936169b62858F13aE0386307\n-   [@Kubesqrt](https://forum.cow.fi/u/kubesqrt) - 0x386b4ba873a4f423ca28a4df1b2347ca949ced0e\n-   [@Chim9](https://forum.cow.fi/u/chim9) - 0xF44217A8b6b3f258BFFEaD635c226528aa516aea\n-   [@mfw78](https://forum.cow.fi/u/mfw78) - 0x0F641723997145715d23c0129b96041011d26666\n\n3 CoW team members:\n-   [@middleway.eth](https://forum.cow.fi/u/middleway.eth) - 0xa11da8b2d9a7883eb636d7de426025e5fd9fda1a\n-   [@Master_CoW](https://forum.cow.fi/u/Master_CoW) - 0x76ba9825a5f707f133124e4608f1f2dd1ef4006a\n-   [@fairlight](https://forum.cow.fi/u/fairlight) - 0xCA55E77Ec514B5BD05B3b2B56f106Ba2Fe593A9f\n\n\nAll committee members have provided a brief description of their background on the [CIP forum discussion](https://forum.cow.fi/t/cip-draft-cowswap-grants-program-cgp/314). The 4 committee members from the community will each individually receive a stipend of 5000 COW per month (30K COW for this 6 months grants period) for their work and commitment to the GrantsDAO. The 3 CoW team members will not receive any stipend.\n\nEach committee member has an assignment term of 6 months after which the program is up for review again by the CowDAO. This limits the CowDAO's engagement to twice yearly.\nIn any scenario where a committee member/signer needs to be replaced from Safe #2, this needs to be arranged by the committee themselves. Meaning that the committee would initiate a Safe signer replacement transaction from within the Safe and have it signed off. Before doing so, this needs to be transparently communicated through the required channels.\n\nThe GrantsDAO can be overruled at any time by an emergency proposal from the CowDAO (e.g. inactivity of 1 or more committee members). Which can result in revoking the GrantsDAO as the signer of the Gnosis Safe with the allocated grant funds.\n\nThe assumption is that 600k in xDAI and 600K in COW token worth of funding seems appropriate, relative to the expected size of the treasury that $COW token holders are entrusted with allocating. Prior to the end of the 6 month proposed grants period, a new CGP Proposal should be tabled by this community using data collected from the CGP to assess the program and inform its next phase.\n\nThe committee is expected to perform proper management of the grant funds. The funds do not need to be spent in full within the 6 months period. Any unspent allocated grant funds within the 6 month period shall be kept in the GrantsDAO as a buffer unless decided otherwise by the CowDAO.\n\nIf the vote passes, the CowDAO shall create and sign transactions which will fund Safe #3 (already created) with 600K in xDAI from Safe #1 and 600K in (bridged) COW tokens from the [CowDAO main net Safe](https://gnosis-safe.io/app/eth:0xcA771eda0c70aA7d053aB1B25004559B918FE662).\n\n## Rationale\nBy funding and setting up a GrantsDAO with a committee:\n-   We provide direct incentives to further grow the CoW Protocol ecosystem;\n-   Will be able to attract the right talent with aligned interests to tackle and solve any existing or future (complex) challenges for the CoW Protocol\n-   Further drive the utility and demand of the $COW token and thus all $COW token holders;\n\n## Voting\n\n-   A quorum is proposed that would require 35M (v)COW tokens required to vote Yes, and anyway more Yes than No votes, in order for this proposal to pass \n-   If the vote passes, the CowDAO shall prepare and sign all the required transactions which will:\n-   Fund Safe #3 with 600K xDAI ([View Tenderly simulation](https://dashboard.tenderly.co/public/safe/safe-apps/simulator/5e3dafe8-e61c-44b3-96e6-90f4ea6a2338))\n-   Fund Safe #3 with 600K COW tokens bridged from the [CowDAO main net Safe](https://gnosis-safe.io/app/eth:0xcA771eda0c70aA7d053aB1B25004559B918FE662) ([View Tenderly simulation](https://dashboard.tenderly.co/public/safe/safe-apps/simulator/f0f931fa-4f65-4547-bf2d-6957dc7d9fca))",

      "title": "CIP-7: Allowing External Solvers",
      "content": "## Simple Summary\n\nAs of March the protocol is rewarding solvers with 100 CoW per solved batch. This has accelerated the interest of the community to participate in the competition and run their own solvers.\n\nCurrently, solver addresses need to be allow-listed in order for the settlement contract to accept their transactions. The allow-list is owned by CoW DAO. Additionally, solvers can be added and removed by a \"manager address\", which is currently the same [Safe](https://gnosis-safe.io/app/eth:0xA03be496e67Ec29bC62F01a428683D7F9c204930/balances) that is doing the rewards payouts.\n\nThis proposal aims to formalize the process with regards to how solvers can get added to the allowlist. In summary, given the potential damage a malicious solver could incur on the protocol, we require solvers to be part of a “bonding pool” which provides an equivalent of $1M (split between COW and cUSDC) as a guarantee in case of misbehavior.\n\nWhen malicious behavior is suspected, all solvers that are part of the affected bonding pool may immediately be suspended and the DAO is consulted as to whether the bond should be slashed (to make up for potential damages caused to traders and/or the protocol).\n\n## Motivation\n\nOne of the main value propositions of CoW Protocol comes from the so-called “solver competition”. Not only does it ensure that “trader surplus” (difference between limit price and price at execution) is given back to the trader rather than being extracted by miners and searchers, it also allows for crowdsourcing of new onchain liquidity sources.\n\nIn order to be able to compete in terms of price and cost with other fast moving protocols and aggregators in the space, it is important to ensure that external people are incentivized to contribute to the price competition and liquidity discovery.\n\n[CIP 2](https://snapshot.org/#/cow.eth/proposal/0x1e3e95d402477b06549d2b7f24bd941f5be4573b701aaa873e773684357c371d) laid the groundwork for this by rewarding the winning solver with 100 COW tokens per batch. However, at this point only select solvers are allowed to participate in the competition. The main reason for this is that there is still a significant amount of “damage” a malicious solver could induce on the protocol and therefore some trust is needed.\n\nWhile the users’ funds and limit prices will always be respected by the smart contract code, important rules of the competition are only enforced off-chain (e.g. uniform clearing prices, choosing the solution with the highest surplus, fair surplus distribution). Moreover, the settlement contract contains significant balance in the form of collected trading fees.\n\nWhile CoW Protocol absolutely wants to open up the competition in a permissionless manner, it needs to do so with care and security deposits in place. At the same time, it wants to keep the barrier to entry low, so that people with little resources can contribute to the competition as well.\n\n## Specification\n\nLet’s revisit the current off-chain architecture:\n\n![|624x409](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/KK2ETtbnempgf1fUdfyg8mzBgMTuDVP43y6-NpKNYRgydP2Q10-kUar4Bs_-I93lq76YE4eK1PgcwrKhDFBLVnlfOcgtLLGJaVP_Do1Mu-Mqoaml3bQ_iD53X4ix-_rqu3UyQHVq)\n\nUsers place orders into the CoW orderbook via the API. A centralized component periodically polls the current orderbook and sends requests to each registered solver to find a solution for this batch. All submitted solutions are ranked by the \"driver\" with regards to the defined objective value and the winning one is submitted on chain (the driver stores a submission address key for each solver).\n\nWhile in the future it may be nice if each solver was responsible for submitting solutions themselves (which would allow for competition on the submission strategy), this would require significant engineering of the system and can therefore likely not be achieved in the timeframe envisioned for this proposal.\n\nWe therefore propose that the driver remains the manager of the “submission keys” for each solver and carries out the ranking and selection of valid solutions. The driver verifies that the solution simulates successfully on the latest block, that clearing prices for user orders are indeed uniform and that the posted prices don’t differ drastically from the prices estimated by the orderbook (the concrete rules for what constitutes a valid solution may evolve in the future). This measure already drastically reduces the damage that a malicious solver can cause (e.g. by ignoring the ranking of the competition). Yet, even the most sophisticated checks in the driver cannot guarantee that a solution is not causing any harm to the protocol. In order to ensure good intent, solvers should be bonded by a collateral consisting of $500,000 worth of cUSDC and 1.5M COW tokens (worth ~$500k). The bond should be stored in a Gnosis Safe where the sole owner is the [CoW DAO](https://gnosis-safe.io/app/eth:0xcA771eda0c70aA7d053aB1B25004559B918FE662). In order to be more capital efficient each creator of such a “bonding pool” may vouch for more than just one solver. However, if one of their solvers is suspected to act maliciously all solvers that belong to the same pool will get suspended until the DAO decides if and how to use the bonding pool’s funds to recover any damage.\n\nA solver is therefore defined by two components\n\n1. The bonding pool’s address which may get slashed in case of misbehavior\n2. The solutions submission address (managed by the driver)\n\nThe process for allowlisting a solver from a developer perspective would then be as follows:\n\n1. Get a solver running based on testing traffic (instructions are beyond the scope of this proposal)\n2. Provide your solver’s API endpoint and the Ethereum address you want to receive rewards via the CoW Discord and receive your solver’s public submission key (private key will be managed by the \"driver\" component).\n3. Create your own or get the creator of an existing bonding pool to vouch for your solver (by signing a transaction containing your solver’s submission key).\n4. Your submission address will be added to the solver allowlist and enabled by the driver in production. You need to make sure to fund the submission address with sufficient ETH to cover the gas costs (gas costs for successful transactions are refunded to your submission address on a weekly basis). COW rewards are paid to the bonding pool (negotiation for a payout/forwarding structure between implementors and pools are beyond the scope of this proposal).\n\nThe listing process may eventually be automated by smart contracts. Initially we suggest that the solver reward Safe remains responsible for updating the allowlist as soon as a solver has been vouched for by a bonding pool and unlist them when they suspect misbehavior. \n\nAny penalty to the bonding pool should be decided upon and executed by the DAO. The DAO shall refund the bonding pool's balance to the initial creator upon request (after unlisting all its solver and verifying no wrong doing was done). Bonding pools can also \"un-vouch\" for solvers via an onchain message (they remain penalizable for its actions until the solver is removed from the allow-list or vouched for by another pool).\n\n## Rationale\n\nThe protocol needs to have reasonable insurance against malicious solvers. At the moment the trust put into solvers stems from Gnosis' continued support and engagement in the protocol. In the absence of such established trust, it is believed that a bond of ~$1M USD provides sufficient security guarantees.\n\nBy using “bonding pools” the system is made permissionless but still allows entities with less resources to get allow-listed as long as an existing pool vouches for them. This way we can allow for both trustless and delegated trust-based solvers.",

      "content": "A shortened version is included below, find the full forum post and discussion here: [CIP-6 Funding for development services - Service Agreement](https://forum.cow.fi/t/cip-draft-funding-for-development-services-service-agreement/574)\n\n# Simple Summary\n\nFollowing the successful passage of the GnosisDAO Improvement Proposal to spin off the Cow Protocol Team, 14.75M USDC were raised from VCs, partners and angels, passing KYC, and sent to a [Safe](https://gnosis-safe.io/app/eth:0xA1cb7762F40318ee0260F53e15De835fF001cb7E/balances) controlled by CowDAO. \n\nThis proposal asks for the payout of a first installment of these funds to benefit Cow Services LDA, the new entity of the Cow Protocol Team, which will act as Service Provider in order to ensure continuous development of the “Cow Suite” (Cow Protocol smart contracts, services, solvers and CowSwap interface and integrations).\n\nTo be operationally independent from Gnosis and to continue contracting and employing the talent needed, the team has incorporated a Portuguese development company - Cow Services Lda.\n\nMore concretely, this proposal asks for 6M USDC for Services for one year, as laid out in detail below. A budgeting estimate for the year is also included in this proposal as well as the associated roadmap. Further, you can find suggested terms at the end of the proposal, to give this Service Agreement a legal framework. \nNote that this proposal is not subject to any of the funds raised via the community options, which amounted to an additional treasury of 748 ETH; 13.8K GNO and 1.6M xDAI for CowDAO. \n\n\n# Motivation\n\nOur motivation is to fulfill CowDAO's vision of a decentralized future where digital assets can be traded in a fair, efficient and reliable manner among people and communities around the world. Our mission is to build a protocol that becomes the most user friendly and price effective way to exchange digital assets, enabling all users to trade securely and know their trades are protected.\n\nBy successfully passing [GIP13,](https://snapshot.org/#/gnosis.eth/proposal/0x9b12a093e17e92b56d070ed876883d8c2331678ca3945e44f66dd416cfd47a64) GnosisDAO gave rise to the CowDAO. CowDAO is now a standalone DAO with the goal of building, maintaining and advancing the Cow Protocol as well as its graphical user interface(s). CowDAO has the financial means to do so and to be fully independent of GnosisDAO or any related party.\n\nThis CIP proposes a way forward to use parts of the funding to dedicate to this purpose and ensure that the team that has been working on the CoW Suite is financially enabled to continue to do so while effectively spinning out of Gnosis. Starting 1 March 2022, Cow Service LDA is financially liable for its operations and will reimburse Gnosis for accrued expenses. In line with the founding vote of CowDAO, it is proposed to leverage CowDAO’s USDC, which was raised from VCs/partners and angels, went through KYC and amounts to 14.75M, for the purpose of funding the continuous development and operations, over the course of several installments. This proposal is asking for a first installment of 6M USDC from 1 March 2022 - 28 February 2023.\n\nWe consider this CIP critical to ensure ongoing development of the CoW Suite and for keeping a competitive edge within the decentralized exchange ecosystem. We do encourage other teams to apply as Service Providers also.\n\n# Service Agreement\n\n## I.a Included services\n\n* Code development and design based on the roadmap (cf. 1.b);\n* Continuous improvement of the existing product and user experience;\n* Executing relevant user research and proposing roadmap adjustments based on its findings;\n* Hosting relevant interfaces, upkeeping and housekeeping of this forum available at forum.cow.fi;\n* Providing public data analysis dashboards;\n* Community management via Discord and Twitter as well as hosting frequent community calls;\n* Representing, promoting and taking part on behalf of the Cow Suite in conferences as well as providing marketing and promotional material and “swag”;\n* Any other assistance and advice that may be provided by Cow Services Lda staff members’ expertise, e.g. computer engineering, design as well as relevant project management;\n* Effective outsourcing to specialists and external parties;\n* Additional, non-product related, operational overhead for running a company and an effective team.\n\n## I.b Development roadmap\n\nThe roadmap is defined by the team in alliance with the CowDAO itself, by means of forum discussion and individual improvement proposals. It’s the responsibility of CowDAO and its members to propose and decide the way forward - we want to comply with this ethos: it’s important to keep this roadmap flexible to adjust to community voices and successful proposals, changing competitive environments as well as improving and changing technological advancements.\n\nThe core focus of the team for the next 3 months:\n\n* Improving the user experience, including but not limited to:\n  * Work on new WETH flow that doesn’t require users to manually wrap their Ether anymore;\n  * Improved prices & support for more liquidity sources;\n  * Improved price estimates;\n  * Improved execution speed;\n  * Decentralization of solvers: defining the rules of the game;\n  * Improved documentation;\n  * Improved & more consistent messaging;\n* Token Utility:\n  * Closely following existing and future proposals on COW utility and implementing them (for example fee discount for COW token holders; LP rewards; incentive programs and more).\n* Governance:\n  * Improving the Snapshot governance space and adapting it to passing proposals (for example adjustments in case COW becomes transferable).\n\nFeatures that might follow after the improvements mentioned above are in place:\n\n* Adding support for EIP2612 (allowing gasless approvals);\n* Deployment on selected Layer 2s;\n* Canonical batches;\n* Limit order interface;\n* Improving the Batch Explorer and adding more information;\n* Adding more information to the CowSwap UI (eg user surplus, trading charts etc., subject to user research).\n\n## I.c Budget\n\nFor a full year - 1 March 2022 - 28 February 2023, the USD budget estimate comprises the following significant positions:\n\nTeam compensation: 2.8m\nFuture contractor compensation: 0.5m\nThird party development services: 0.8m\nExternal tooling: 70k\nNetwork fees (gas): 120k\nMarketing, business development: 150k\nExpenses (e.g. business travel etc.): 120k\nOperational (legal, accounting, bank accounts): 100k\nProvision for tax purposes: 1.4m\n\n# The team\n\nThe team that plans to build the CoW Suite has been doing so previously (as part of Gnosis) and is dedicated to continue working towards making the protocol successful. We have carefully recruited and will continue to do so in the future. The team is led by [Anna George](https://twitter.com/AnnaMSGeorge) on the product and by [Felix Leupold](https://twitter.com/fleupold_) on the engineering side. You can find both their recent EthDenver talks [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RHx4AiaUCM&ab_channel=ETHDenver), where Felix speaks of becoming a Solver for Cow Protocol and [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox97ZniGLWE) where Anna speaks about why DAOs should use CowSwap. The team consists of 22 full-time positions (and is currently hiring for additional [9 open positions](https://hackmd.io/qC8mRYx0REW0J5JwQuTXqg?view)). The team’s expertise include roles such as cryptographer, mathematicians, user researchers as well as business development, marketing, operations and HR. Furthermore, we have built up a suite of ecosystem, legal - and academic advisors who will help us achieve the success of the Cow Suite. Meet the team on [Discord](http://discord.gg/cowprotocol).\n\n# Rational\n\nIt is the intention to further decentralize the team with anyone who wishes to work directly for CowDAO or a sub-DAO. For the moment, it is difficult for single contributors to work directly for the unincorporated DAO. While we strive for decentralization not only on product level but also organisationally, we see this proposal as a workable solution in the meantime. The first order of business for decentralizing “more” is for the CowDAO to incentivise other players to build relevant integrations on-top such that “third party development services” as outlined in I.c. above can also be paid out by the DAO in future (currently there is also a [CIP](https://forum.cow.fi/t/cip-draft-cowswap-grants-program-cgp/314) for a Grant Program in the Forum, which could be a first step in this direction).\n\n## II Terms of the Service Agreement\n\n### Validity\n\n* This Service Agreement and any following Service Agreement is subject to the successful passage of the Governance Mechanism set in place by CowDAO (and as defined in the implemented [Participation Agreement](https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/Qmf9MYhcG2pFrDoVy13p6FWeVF4nG9HbJvRfYYbhazTCFe) or any updated version thereof).\n* The commencing of the Services is effective per successful passing of the proposal, retrospectively starting from 1 March 2022.\n* The Services shall be deemed concluded if either the funds are exhausted or by 28 February 2023.\n* There is no automatic extension or renewal of this Service Agreement.\n* The agreement cannot be terminated within the one year period (counting from 1 March 2022).\n\n### Compensation\n\n* The fee for the Services described above is 6,000,000 USDC (six million).\n* The fee corresponds to an estimate of the sum of all costs borne with the performance of the Services starting 1 March 2022 and comprising an entire calendar year, based on a time and material basis.\n* The costs incurred with the provision of the Services to be considered are the direct and indirect costs.\n* If in doubt, the fee is considered to be split equally across calendar months.\n* The Company may review the fee according to actual costs incurred on a monthly basis, proposing changes and amendments, which in turn will be subject to the Governance Mechanism and therefore approval by CowDAO.\n* Any request for changes or amendments will be accompanied by a justification of prior costs borne (time reporting).\n\n### Payment\n\n* With the successful passing of the proposal CowDAO agrees to a pre-payment of the fee and is not subject to further invoices.\n* Unless Cow Services asks for further compensation due to incorrect estimation there will not be a detailed time reporting.\n* The fee is to be transferred from CowDAO’s [Safe](https://gnosis-safe.io/app/eth:0xA1cb7762F40318ee0260F53e15De835fF001cb7E/balances) at the successful passage of Phase II.\n* The wallet it will be transferred to will be included in Phase II.\n\n### Scope\n\n* Some of the line items mentioned in the budget may decrease in the future, some may increase over the coming year. The rate is calculated as expenses of 500,000 USD linearly throughout the year. Hence, 2023’s pre-payment for January and February accrue to 1,000,000 USD (note that this may be important for tax reasons).\n* If the Services substantially widen and Cow Services grows its team for this purpose (beyond covering 30 full-time positions), Cow Services will propose another Service Agreement for a new installment of the 14.75M USDC in funding received by VCs, partners and angels.\n* If Cow Services may dissolve any accounting provisions (such as tax provisions), arising positive cash-flow will be reinvested into the company, in line with CowDAO's vision of a decentralized future and mission of enhancing the Cow Suite.\n\n## Execution\n\n### Safe Transaction Data\nCowDAO main safe will execute a transaction from its daughter safe at `0xA1cb7762F40318ee0260F53e15De835fF001cb7E` to send 6m USDC to the Cow Services safe at `0x6adc7a8e9a73dbf1096a425cabe07b83060d4ba4`\n```\n[\n    {\n      \"to\": \"0xA1cb7762F40318ee0260F53e15De835fF001cb7E\",\n      \"data\": \"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\",\n      \"value\": \"0\",\n      \"operation\": 0\n    }\n]\n```\n\n### Tenderly Simulation\n[Link to Tenderly simulation](https://dashboard.tenderly.co/public/gp-v2/cow-cips/simulator/a7ed1fe8-c434-46fa-b343-a0bfeaa94bd7)",

      "title": "CIP-5: Enable Swapping of vCOW to COW",
      "content": "Find the Forum post and discussion here: [CIP-5: Enable Swapping of vCOW to COW](https://forum.cow.fi/t/cip-draft-enable-swapping-of-vcow-to-cow/91)\n\n## Simple Summary\n\nThe purpose of this CIP is to gather support within the community for enabling the swapping of vCOW tokens into COW tokens. COW is a standard ERC-20 token which can be transferred and traded freely.\n\n## Motivation\n\nThis CIP will advance CowAO by allowing vCOW holders to swap vCOW for COW tokens. This will allow the token to become transferrable tradable outside of the CowDAO ecosystem encouraging price discovery of the COW token. Consequently, CowDAO will be able to proceed with additional important proposals such as the Community Grant Program, Affiliate Program Incentives, Solver Incentives, and more.\n\n## Specification\n\nIt is proposed to enable the *swapAll* function in the vCOW smart contract by sending COW tokens from CowDAOs treasury into the vCOW contract. The proposed deployment code is available [here](https://github.com/gnosis/cow-proposals/tree/main/src/proposals/make-vcow-swappable).\n\n- Before execution, the code will need to be updated with the final amount of vCOW that have been claimed and will be eligible for swapping. This will be known by 25.03.2022 when airdrop claims will officially end.\n- The execution transaction will transfer the needed amount of COW tokens from CowDAOs mainnet safe to vCOW mainnet contract\n- Additionally the needed amount of COW tokens will be bridged and sent to vCOW contract on Gnosis Chain to enable swapping of vCOW on Gnosis Chain.\n\n### Changes to CowDAO voting\nAs of now, CowDAO is governed by vCOW token holders. Assuming no changes to governance rules, COW token holders will not be able to vote on future proposals. \nIt is proposed to change CowDAOs governance rules and adapt its snapshot space to count both vCOW **and** COW as valid for voting on CowDAO proposals.\n\n### Incorporation of additional proposals for a combined execution\n\n**[CIP-draft: COW liquidity incentive program](https://forum.cow.fi/t/cip-draft-cow-liquidity-incentive-program/295)**\nAs the COW token becomes tradable, the community might want to consider a liquidity incentive program that will reward liquidity providers. The rational for joint execution is detailed in the proposal.\n\nAt the moment it is still unknown if the proposal for COW liquidity incentives will be approved. If it will be approved before this proposal, it is proposed to execute them jointly. The proposal for swapping vCOW to COW is independent and will be executed upon approval even if liquidity incentive program is not approved prior.\n\n\n## Safe Transaction Data\n\nThe below transaction data is an example including estimated amounts.

      "content": "Find the Forum post and discussion here: [CIP-4: COW liquidity incentive program](https://forum.cow.fi/t/cip-draft-cow-liquidity-incentive-program/295/40)\n\n## Simple Summary\n\nThe purpose of this CIP is to gather support within the community to allow the treasury to release COW tokens as reward to Liquidity Providers, in order to foster a healthy ecosystem for holders and the DAO.\n\n## Motivation\n\nThis proposal will establish liquidity for the COW token by encouraging Liquidity Providers (LP) to provide the necessary liquidity required to grow and foster a healthy ecosystem.\nHowever, in order to encourage LPs, incentives must be aligned as they will be taking on risk.\n**Goals:**\n\n- Initiate liquidity of ~$10m\n- Ideally a 100k trade should incur no more than 1-2% slippage\n- Reward users who are willing to provide liquidity and take the impermanent-loss risk\n- Limit rewards to not attract speculators but mainly long term believers in COW.\n- Reasonable COW spending to not create too much sell pressure (from potential farmers)\n\n## Specification\n\nCowDAO will use 960k COW tokens to establish a liquidity reward program for 12 weeks.\nThe program is proposed to incentivize few liquidity pools:\n**Mainnet**\n\n1. Balancer pool: 50%COW/50%ETH\n2. Balancer pool: 50%COW/50%GNO\n- Balancer DAO: 12 weeks of 200-BAL-per-week for each pool.\n- CowDAO: 12 weeks of 30k-COW-per-week for each pool (please see below the edit note)\n- If the combined liquidity will reach >$5M, BAL rewards will be increased by Balancer DAO.\n\n**Gnosis Chain**\n\n- Swapr pool: 50%COW/50%ETH\n- CowDAO: 12 weeks of 20k-COW-per-week.\n- DXdao: 350k SWPR & 65 GNO over 12 weeks\n\n**Implementation**\n\n- Balancer will be implementing the dual rewards for LPs similar to the [wstETH pool](https://app.balancer.fi/#/pool/0x32296969ef14eb0c6d29669c550d4a0449130230000200000000000000000080) for 12 weeks following the execution of this proposal.\n- DXdao will implement a reward strategy that will include base triple rewards and an extra performance reward in [Carrot](https://carrot.eth.limo/) tokens. In order to achieve optimized liquidity,  a 4-week campaign with ~40% of capital and a follow up 8-week campaign with 60% of capital is proposed. [This pool](https://swapr.eth.limo/#/rewards/0x6A023CCd1ff6F2045C3309768eAd9E68F978f6e1/0x9C58BAcC331c9aa871AFD802DB6379a98e80CEdb/0x99Ed8bf6F12AC007a22764B84a306C529bE6ABD4?chainId=100) can be used as an example for how it would roughly look.\n- Any remaining COW tokens that (for any reason) were not used for its intended purpose of rewarding COW liquidity, will be returned to CowDAO after 12 weeks. \n\nThe program is intended target an estimated 15%-20% APY on capital locked (but of course depends ultimately on utilization of the pools) . Rewards will be assessed and potentially extended and / or changed by CowDAO and other parties during and after 12 weeks.\n\n**Note:** As a next step to this proposal, and after a price is established for the COW token, CowDAO might want to consider deploying liquidity from its own treasury. This represents an opportunity for the DAO to show commitment by taking the same impermanent-loss risk it asks its community to take.\nAdditionally, this will ensure a minimum amount of liquidity and could be a good strategy for deploying the treasury to generate extra yield.\n\n## Execution\n\nIt is proposed to be executed by transfers of COW tokens out of CowDAO mainnet Safe:\n\n1.  720k COW to ```0xc38c5f97B34E175FFd35407fc91a937300E33860``` - Balancer DAO team safe on mainnet\n2.  240k COW to ```0x9467dcFD4519287e3878C018c02f5670465a9003``` - Multisig that has been used by DXdao for launching Carrot and SWPR campaigns when not through the DAO\n\n\nThis proposal is dependent on the successful execution of [CIP-draft: Enable Swapping of vCOW to COW](https://forum.cow.fi/t/cip-draft-enable-swapping-of-vcow-to-cow/91?u=middleway.eth). It is proposed to execute both proposals together in order to have liquidity incentive program in place when COW becomes transferable.\n\n\n### Safe Transaction Data\nIncludes three interactions:\n- Send 720k COW to Balancer safe on mainnet\n- Approve 240k COW for bridging\n- Bridge and send 240k COW to DXdao sefe\n\n```\n[\n  [\n    {\n      \"to\": \"0xDEf1CA1fb7FBcDC777520aa7f396b4E015F497aB\",\n      \"data\": \"0xa9059cbb000000000000000000000000c38c5f97b34e175ffd35407fc91a937300e338600000000000000000000000000000000000000000000098774738bc8222000000\",\n      \"value\": \"0\",\n      \"operation\": 0\n    },\n    {\n      \"to\": \"0xDEf1CA1fb7FBcDC777520aa7f396b4E015F497aB\",\n      \"value\": \"0\",\n      \"data\": \"0x095ea7b300000000000000000000000088ad09518695c6c3712ac10a214be5109a6556710000000000000000000000000000000000000000000032d26d12e980b6000000\",\n      \"operation\": 0\n    },\n    {\n      \"to\": \"0x88ad09518695c6c3712AC10a214bE5109a655671\",\n      \"value\": \"0\",\n      \"data\": \"0xad58bdd1000000000000000000000000def1ca1fb7fbcdc777520aa7f396b4e015f497ab0000000000000000000000009467dcfd4519287e3878c018c02f5670465a90030000000000000000000000000000000000000000000032d26d12e980b6000000\",\n      \"operation\": 0\n    }\n  ]\n]\n\n```\n\n## Rationale\n\n- Liquidity is essential for any token. This program will encourage community members to provide liquidity for the COW token.\n- Decent liquidity will enable new participants to buy COW with minimal friction.\n- Dampen COW token volatility\n",

      "title": "CIP-3: Trading Fee Discounts for COW holders",
      "content": "\nFind the Forum post and discussion here: “[CIP-3: Trading Fee discount for COW holders](https://forum.cow.fi/t/cip-3-trading-fee-discount-for-cow-holders/325)”\n\n\n## **Summary - Trading Fee discount for COW holders**\nThe purpose of this CIP is to gather support within the community to pass a vote to allow a reduction in trading fees for COW holders. A token based fee discount will improve the tokens’ utility and foster a healthy ecosystem for users of the protocol, COW holders and the DAO.\n\n\n## **Motivation**\nBy rewarding COW token holders with a trading fee discount on the CowSwap platform, demand for COW tokens will grow and help make CowSwap a hub of activity for DeFi.\n\n**Goals:**\n\n* Improve utility for the COW token and increase demand for it;\n* Reward DAO members for holding COW;\n* Higher demand for the token will encourage further interactions with the Cow Protocol and facilitate its growth.\n\n\n## **Proposal**\nWhile it is envisioned to implement a more elaborate fee discount system long term, this CIP proposes to launch with a simple fee discount mechanism to accommodate “[CIP-Enable Swapping of vCOW to COW](https://forum.cow.fi/t/cip-draft-enable-swapping-of-vcow-to-cow/91)” and be implemented on time in case the token becomes transferable. It will allow CowDAO to reward and incentivize long term holding of the token.\n\nA simple tier system is proposed that would allow to reward different user groups adequately:\n\n\n**Tiers:**\nHaving multiple tiers will ensure that discounts can be offered to almost everyone, but at the same time large token holders also feel appreciated. It will also help to create utility and value for the token: in theory, the more tiers (or even a dynamic fee model) would have the largest impact. The closer a user is to the lower bound of their tier, the less likely they are to sell any tokens. As a dynamic model or too many tiers are not practical for implementation, it is proposed to initially launch with 4 tiers:\n\n* Tier 1 1,000 COW Discount: 5%\n* Tier 2 10,000 COW Discount: 10%\n* Tier 3 100,000 COW Discount: 20%\n* Tier 4 1,000,000 COW Discount: 40%\n\n**Scope:**\nNote that this proposal is within the scope of what’s technically feasible to be implemented until vCOW might become swappable for COW. Eligibility criteria:\n\n* Simple hodling of the token in the trading wallet makes traders eligible\n* Combined balance of vCOW and COW is accounted for *per network*\n* Time scope of proposal: the token related fee discounts will end when any of the conditions are met: the funds dedicated for this purpose run out, or after 6 months, or when CowDAO decides to end the program. It is expected that CowDAO will evaluate the success of the fee discounts and make appropriate adjustments if needed.\n\n\n**Costs:**\nAs Cow Protocol is currently only imposing a fee that’s large enough to cover users’ gas costs, any subsidies provided are directly taken from CowDAO’s treasury. To limit the expenses of this program, especially in an environment where gas costs are little predictable, it is proposed to allocate a certain amount of funding for this fee subsidy program. Specifically, it is proposed to send 60 ETH to the same [Safe](https://gnosis-safe.io/app/eth:0xA03be496e67Ec29bC62F01a428683D7F9c204930/balances) that is already handling the Solver reimbursements and rewards (as defined in [CIP-2](https://forum.cow.fi/t/cip-2-solver-rewards/488/3)).\nIt is proposed to use CowDAO’s ETH to finance the subsidies, rather than leveraging COW Tokens, as this program aims to increase demand for COW and subsequently reduce its sell pressure.\n\nRough estimation of gas costs for this program:\n\n* Based on the airdrop distribution, there are currently ~7K accounts who fall in tier 1 (out of which 5.5K are power* CowSwap traders); ~1K accounts that fall in tier 2 (out of which 500 are power* CowSwap traders); ~40 accounts who fall in tier 3 (out of which 3 are power CowSwap traders); and ~11 accounts in tier 4 (out of which 1 is a CowSwap power trader). [*Power traders defined by accounts that were granted user options as part of the airdrop allocations.] Find the full airdrop distribution list [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1a8R-189LHjXb2_ozBiBF0scYYU8eqDkO9IJcplZPafM/edit#gid=2095434710).\n* Over the last 30 days, solvers spent 338ETH in gas costs.\n* Assuming that 90% of Cow Protocol’s trading activity is generated via it’s power users, proportionally distributed amongst the different tiers (92% of trades at 5% discount; 8% trades at 10% discount; 0.05% trades at 20% discount; and 0.02% trades at 40% discount), the subsidy cost for a 30-days-period would equal ~20 ETH. Note that this is a *very* rough calculation, as many factors defining gas costs are not considered here and a proportional distribution does not fully reflect reality.\n* The subsidy needed for GnosisChain is significantly lower as gas costs are marginal. The monthly funding needed would be <2 xDAI and is not worth the tx cost for reimbursing solvers. Therefore, it is proposed that solvers are covering the cost for the fee subsidy on GnosisChain. This can be retrospectively considered when a strategy for reimbursements and rewards of solvers on other networks is being discussed.\n* As the proposed fee discount is a new program that should be re-evaluated, it is proposed to only provide funding for an estimated 3 months period: 60ETH.\n\nThis program will end if: \n* The allotted funds are fully used.\n* 6 months have passed, or\n* If CowDAO votes to modify the program. \n\nIn the latter two cases the remaining funds are to be sent back to the CowDAO’s treasury. It will lie within the responsibility of Cow Service LDA to create public tracking (likely in the form of a Dune Dashboard) of the discount related spending, to send a timely signal to the DAO when the funds are close to run out, and to stop the program if any one of the conditions to stop the fee discount are met. It is CowDAO’s responsibility to assess the impact of this program and re-evaluate any additional subsidies and adjustments to this program in the future. \n\n\n## **Preventing users from gaming the system**\n\nWhen discussing fee discounts, there needs to be a common understanding of the fees that are being charged by CowDAO today. CowDAO did not yet invoke any volume based fee, instead it is simply charging users the expected gas costs for their transaction. Hence, any gaming of the fee discount tiers that would cost > x% of the gas cost of one transaction [where x is depending on the tier], is not economically viable. Therefore, it seems not yet a requirement to enforce locking of COW for eligibility to the discounts. Though, it is recommended to discuss token locks for future fee discount proposals, as any locking of COW also comes with additional economic benefits for its ecosystem. \nOnce CowDAO decides on taking a volume based fee, the fee discount mechanism likely has to be revised, to avoid exploits by users who are not long term holders of COW. \n\nAs mentioned, a preferable scenario for the future would be that fee discounts are facilitated only to users who are locking their COW for a certain time period. It could then also be considered to allow for fee discounts across networks, basically allowing users to hold a balance on any network(s) but be eligible for the discount on other networks as well; this is however not practical as long as tokens aren’t locked up, as users could buy&sell COW on networks with low gas costs such as Gnosis Chain to benefit from large discounts on more expensive networks. As mentioned, lock contracts are out of scope for this proposal. This proposal aims to facilitate a first, simplified fee discount mechanism to test its impact on users. \n\nPrior to the end of this program, a NEW Trading Fee Discount proposal should be tabled by this community using data from the previous period to assess the program and inform its next phase. Also, in case CowDAO decides to invoke a volume based fee, the fee discount tiers should likewise receive another review to ensure that incentives to exploit the fee discount have not increased. \n\n\n\n## Execution\n\nThis proposal is dependent on the successful execution of “[CIP-draft: Enable Swapping of vCOW to COW 8”](https://forum.cow.fi/t/cip-draft-enable-swapping-of-vcow-to-cow/91). It is proposed to execute both proposals together in order to have discounts available once COW becomes transferable.\n\n### Safe Transaction Hash\n\n> 0x84ecca5b5e2d4a6c7ecf5a2bb8c9cf73ec7546e8c8e3185e22454c5b328c817a\n\n### Safe Transaction Data\n\n> to: 0xA03be496e67Ec29bC62F01a428683D7F9c204930\n> value: 60000000000000000000\n> data: 0x\n> operation: 0\n> safeTxGas: 0\n> baseGas: 0\n> gasPrice: 0\n> gasToken: 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000\n> refundReceiver: 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000\n> nonce: 1\n\n### Transaction Simulation\n\nhttps://dashboard.tenderly.co/annageorge/project/simulator/a1b839c6-a6bb-4de4-b8e8-64a837c3caa1",

This proposal is aiming at solvers operating on mainnet only.\n\n### Motivation\n\nOne of the core parties in the CoW Protocol are the so-called solvers: Entities that compete for the best execution of user orders and eventually submit the on-chain transaction settling their trades. Solvers are run by external parties (currently still controlled by Gnosis) and incur significant costs in the form of transaction gas fees from their operation.\n\nWith CoW Protocol spinning off from Gnosis, it is imperative to quickly set up an adequate incentive scheme so that solvers continue to participate in the protocol.\n\n### Cow Protocol Revenue & Cost Structure\n\nAt the moment CoW Protocol is charging users a fixed fee per order denominated in the sell token. That fee is taken atomically as part of the settlement transaction if and only if the order is executed. The fee is currently computed by the protocol’s orderbook API by estimating the gas costs the user would incur by trading on a DEX Aggregator and converting that gas fee into the sell token.\n\nThe fees are collected in the settlement contract. Solvers have access to those balances and could therefore withdraw the fees. However, due to the fact the the protocol currently subsidizes trades, fees don’t fully cover the expenses solvers incur (cf. [Dune](https://dune.xyz/queries/232550/435416)):\n\n![|624x172](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/o_3I3SOtmIfcqxHHkOWFOs9fJl-DjrA-znUQNWnq3RTGGQROVIew5za5stkzj6fBHXRZRPpgmrMj-Aq6imxTUb-GHvAiQuepriyM2wOPFBRGQ6EOoadrE__Ci8077cJ59Rq5bst8)\n\nWhile the exact amount of the subsidy - and therefore the expected loss - is easily configurable, changing the subsidy strategy is outside the scope of this proposal.\n\nOn top of revenue in the form of fees and cost in the form of gas costs, solvers and the protocol have a few other operational factors that affect their profitability (we ignore server costs as they tend to be minor):\n\n* Failed transaction costs: Failed settlements yield no trading fee, but still cost gas.\n* Positive/Negative Slippage: Orders are executed at the price the solver reported in the off-chain competition. The actual achieved price on-chain may differ (e.g. when the AMM’s price moved in the meantime, or the solver got sandwiched, etc). Currently the protocol keeps positive slippage and pays negative slippage from the token balances it accrues from fees.\n* Inventory Risk: Since the fee is taken in the sell token but gas costs are paid in ETH, revenue is not captured in the same unit as cost. Fluctuations in token prices may therefore affect the value of ETH or USD stored in the contract. Moreover, some solvers currently fill orders from existing balance in the settlement contract to avoid the gas cost involved with interacting with an AMM. Moving funds across buffers also incurs an inventory risk.\n\n### How to reward Solvers?\n\nWe suggest to begin by rewarding solvers with a fixed CoW token promise (100 COW per solved batch) and to refund them their entire successfully executed settlement transaction cost. Reimbursements will be done in ETH and gas costs can be easily tracked via Dune.\n\nIn return, all balances that are accrued inside the settlement contract are considered protocol revenues and belong to the CoW DAO (>$11M revenue to date) going forward. However, all fees accrued before the target date for this CIP still belong to Gnosis. Gnosis will withdraw as many balances as it deems reasonable from the settlement contract prior to the target date. As of then, the balances fully belong to CoW Protocol.\n\n**Inventory Risk**\n\nIn order to minimize the inventory risk of balances held in the contract, we propose to restrict the list of tokens with which solvers are allowed to perform gas cost optimizations by not routing the trades via an AMM (“internal buffers”) to a hardcoded token list of tokens the protocol is willing to hold.\n\nMoreover, solvers are only allowed to replace trades at a “real” exchange rate they found on-chain. Failure to prove the existence of such liquidity on any of the blocks between the start of the auction and the solution submission, results in the deduction of the traded amounts (in ETH) from the gas refund.\n\n**Slippage**\n\nSolvers are expected to not incur negative slippage on average over all trades during the reward period. While positive and negative slippage may occur on a per batch basis, when tallied up over the entire reward period, a total negative slippage may be withheld from the reward. A total positive slippage belongs to the protocol. Slippage will be tracked using a Dune dashboard.\n\n### Specification\n\nCOW DAO will fund a Gnosis Safe that is controlled by the Cow Protocol development team with 500 ETH and 7M COW (~10 weeks of runway) and whitelist this Safe as a solver on the protocol. The team will periodically withdraw tokens of which the contract holds significant balance (>$1000) and convert them into ETH. The converted ETH together with the initial funds will be used by the team to - once a week - refund all participating solver addresses the equivalent of their gas amounts spent.\n\nTo summarize the rules of the refunds:\n\n1. As of March 1st, solvers receive a full refund on all ETH spent on gas for successful Mainnet settlements\n2. Additionally, solvers receive 100 COW tokens for every successful Mainnet settlement.\n3. Payments happen weekly (first payout after the vote passed, retroactively covers period from March 1st).\n4. Solvers are allowed to trade internal balances only from if the token they buy is in [this list](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmS4rsL6S9fj3Zht2daGn7vfipgz9jhJMGmirdBcYveZYh). The list shall in the future be made available via ENS and is subject to change by the development team in the best interest of the protocol.\n5. Positive and negative slippage for each solver is tallied up over the whole rewards period. Profits stay in the protocol, losses will be deducted from the gas refund.\n\n### Rationale\n\nWith CowSwap spinning off from Gnosis it needs a quick and pragmatic solution for keeping solvers incentivised to pay large amounts of ETH per week in transaction fees. This proposal is very close to the previous modus operandi where a large portion of the operational cost would be covered by swapping internal balances for ETH, and previously Gnosis (now the CoW DAO) would provide ~50 ETH per week in additional funds to cover the loss mainly arising from fee subsidies.\n\nWhile Gnosis solvers are no longer willing to cover these costs without a reward, they are generally still very much aligned with the success of the protocol and can be trusted to operate in good faith. While we believe a more sophisticated and adversary prone reward system is needed in the future, we would like to focus our short term development on building out new core features and bringing more people to CoW Protocol while at the same time offering a basic but appealing reward system for solvers.\n\nWe want to make it as easy as possible for external solvers to join the CoW Protocol. By not having them deal with the complexities from inventory risk and slippage we think new participants are more encouraged to join.\n\nWe believe that this proposal is both simple and effective for all parties involved and therefore achieves these goals.",

      "content": "The discussion forum post for this proposal is available [here](https://forum.cow.fi/t/cip-1-adopt-participation-agreement/493)\nThe PDF version of the Participation agreement is hosted on IPFS [here](https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/Qmf9MYhcG2pFrDoVy13p6FWeVF4nG9HbJvRfYYbhazTCFe). This is the final version to be voted on.\nIf this proposal is approved, DAO members are encouraged to pin the document on their IPFS clients.\n\n## **Simple Summary**\n\nThis is a proposal to implement a private ordering agreement (a so-called “Participation Agreement”) among all DAO Participants to provide an operating framework for CowDAO and to govern the rights and obligations of each party.\n\n## **Abstract**\n\nThe participation agreement:\n\n* Explains the CowDAO’s governance mechanism and determines who CowDAO participants are.\n* Explains the contribution of GnosisDAO and its limitations.\n* Provides a mutual release by DAO participants from claims arising out of or in connection with the CowDAO and a mutual waiver of claims against CowDAO and other DAO participants.\n* Limits the liability of the CowDAO, GnosisDAO, the service providers, and the signers in relation to loss or damage arising under or in connection with the use of CowDAO smart contracts.\n* Provides a complaints and dispute resolution procedure.\n\n## **Motivation**\n\nAs a DAO that is currently not wrapped in a legacy system entity, it is paramount to minimize the legal risks to CowDAO participants as much as possible while maintaining its decentralized nature. It does not exclude the possibility of members voting in favor of a legal wrapper/incorporation at a future point in time.\n\n## **Specification**\n\nIf this proposal passes, CowDAO and its participants will adopt the proposed [CowDAO Participation Agreement](https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/Qmf9MYhcG2pFrDoVy13p6FWeVF4nG9HbJvRfYYbhazTCFe). A PDF copy will be stored on IPFS and linked as terms in the cow.eth snapshot space. By voting on any future proposal CowDAO participants agree to be bound by this Participation Agreement.\n\n## **Rationale**\n\nNo single party is in control of the CowDAO. It is managed by its members, and does not have any director or manager. While it is entirely up to CowDAO participants to decide to incorporate the DAO into a legal framework, at its onset, it is an unwrapped/unincorporated organization.\n\nThe attempted shoehorning of DAOs by legal systems into existing categories such as unregistered organizations, unincorporated associations or general partnerships leads to concerns that DAO participants may be held liable for the actions of the DAO. While CowDAO Participants cannot dictate states and state regulators how to characterize CowDAO, participants can use whatever private law mechanism at disposal to frame the CowDAO as it is internally viewed and minimize legal risks as much as possible to CowDAO and CowDAO participants.",
