A few L2 chains stood out in the recent discussion: Polygon, Arbitrum, and Optimism.\n\nPlease consider as you vote:\n1. which chain you will help the protocol grow the fastest through liquidity, marketing, and adoption.\n2. which chain you will able to help get boostrapped by buying and boosting HOME and adding liquidity to a DEX. \n3. which L2 has the strongest stability, security, and scaling.\n",

Given what has happened in crypto in the last few months it just triggers too much negative sentiment.  We loved the idea behind Bacon i.e. \"Bring home the bacon,\" which can be traced far back to exchanging some of you for work.  However,  in the face of the feedback and (thankfully) return to building solid defi foundations, we need a name that matches our durable, transparent, stable project. \n\nWe hope to have your support in making a change for the better of the protocol that more closely reflects our ethos.\n\nWe are proposing a vote to change the name of the governance token away from BACON and to remove the remaining associated branding. This vote is only to decide whether to rename or not. Choice of a new name will happen after there is signal that governance is behind a change. \n",

Mint HOME on borrow. Burn HOME on principal repayment.\n2. Remove USDC deposit/redeem from contracts. Move all HOME exchange to DEX pools.\n3.

Selling loans would provide USDC to the protocol that could be used by holders of unboosted HOME to redeem their HOME for USDC.\n\nThis would also result in the protocol losing continued payments from those loans and, when new liquidity comes in, having to incur overhead buy new loans at the prevailing rate at the time. It is uncertain and unpredictable what rates will be and how that will affect the protocol.\n\nBalancing the short-term liquidity needs of HOME holders against the expectations of long-term HOME holders is an important goal of the protocol.\n\nSelling loans would also give the protocol a chance to show the process and prove out the selling system.\n\nIf this proposal is successful, the protocol would be directing the servicer (LoanSnap) to\n\n- use their capital markets relationships to sell a number of loans\n- return the proceeds to the protocol in USDC\n- remove the corresponding liens from the protocol\n- stop receiving payments from those borrowers\n\nThe protocol team recommends that loans of various rates be selected to sell so that the balance between return and stability of returns is kept.\n\nFormal requests for $165,000 worth of USDC have been made. It appears there is also some informal demand for liquidity.\n\nThe protocol currently holds ~$6.7m worth of loans at a blended rate of 2.55%. These loans are a mix of first lien and SmartLoc loans.\n\nThe proposal is to either sell no loans, sell enough to cover the formal request for liquidity, or sell enough to cover the request and have an additional liquidity buffer.\n",

      "title": "Rewards Distribution",
      "content": "This proposal is to add in a rewards distribution following the change to HOME to become fully stable. Before rewards were distributed through increase in the price of HOME. Now they will be claimable through the smart contracts with three levels.\n\n\nTLDR; \n\nHolders get a small amount, locking HOME for a short period of time gets more, locking HOME for a longer period of time gets the most!\n\n\n* Hold HOME in a wallet - 1%\n\n* Lock HOME for 90 days - 2% + 1x BACON\n\n* Lock HOME for 1 year - Get full returns + 2x BACON\n\n\nAll the deets;\n\nOne consistent problem since the start of the protocol is not knowing how long people intend for their liquidity to stay in the protocol. Some times it's a few days. Sometimes it's effectively forever. That makes it very hard for the AMM to make good decisions about making the kinds of long term loans the protocol provides.\n\nThis system will allow users of the protocol to let it know how long it gets to use the liquidity and in return, users get a bigger return for locking up their HOME for longer terms.\n\nHere are the proposed levels:\n\n1. Hold HOME in a wallet. Get 1%.\n\nSimple. Easy. Don't have to do anything special. Just get some HOME in your wallet.\n\nThe protocol will know the liquidity in wallets shouldn't be lent out and will be available for liquidity. It does reduce the amount the protocol can earn since it can't lend those funds out long term, so the return is low. Even when mortgage rates were at historic lows, there was sufficient income to the protocol to cover this reward level.\n\n\n2. Lock for 90 days. Get 2%. Earn 1x BACON.\n\nAlso simple. Take HOME to the contract and lock it for 90 days and get 2% claimable at the end of 90 days. At the end of 90 days, you can withdraw your HOME or relock for another 90 days automatically.\n\nThese funds can be used by the protocol for holding mortgages short-term that it expects to sell off within 10-30 days.\n\nThis level earns base BACON returns, but only half as much as the next level.\n\n3. Lock for 1 year. Get maximum returns (currently 3-5%). Earn 2x BACON.\n\nIf you're already planning to be in the protocol long term and stack your BACON, might as well get in long term.\n\nThe protocol will know these funds are around for a while and use them for mortgage making.\n\nTake your HOME to the contract and lock for 1 year. This level earns the maximum returns for HOME.\n\nThe returns for this level are the full return from the mortgages in the Pan plus any excess return over the 1-2% earned by the other levels. For example, if the Pan is earning 6% and one third of the liquidity is in each level, then the top level could earn 8% by borrowing return from the other levels.\n\n\nEarly Exit\n\nThe 90 day and 1 year lockups will create receipt tokens that could be traded on DEX pool at a discount to their face value for people that need to exit the position early and get liquidity.\n\n",

      "title": "Make bHOME a true stable coin",
      "content": "When bHOME was first invented, we decided to use the price mechanism as a way to send value back to holders without having to do anything. Just hold bHOME. That made the contracts and user experience simple and easy to implement.\n\nAs the Bacon Protocol has grown and matured the last six months, we’ve found that increasing the price of bHOME has been a source of lots of questions and confusion. It also put bHOME in a weird spot between stable coins and other coins -- not quite stable but not fully variable either.\n\nToday, we’re proposing to change bHOME to be fully stable against the US Dollar and to move rewards to a claiming system. This will increase the size of the market interested in bHOME and the Bacon Protocol, make it possible to integrate bHOME with more other protocols, and simplify bHOME to be easier for new users to understand.\n\nHere’s the proposed changes to the protocol:\n\n\n- Change the Pan contract to always exchange bHOME to USDC and back at exactly 1 bHOME : 1 USDC.\n- Always have the amount of outstanding bHOME be equal to the USDC in the Pan plus the sum of outstanding loans.\n- Airdrop existing bHOME holders new bHOME to cover the difference between $1 and the bHOME price when the new contract is deployed.\n- Make a new system where bHOME base rewards are claimable. Temporarily send interest paid to the protocol to an observable multi-sig wallet for a few weeks until the new system is on-chain.\n- The origination and servicing fee to the protocol and servicer will continue to be paid in bHOME. The 1% fee will now be deduced from the loan amount sent to the originator and will effectively be paid by the borrower.",
