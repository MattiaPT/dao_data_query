      "title": "OIP-88: Orange DAO will create a Digital Nation of Founders",
      "content": "tl;dr - \nthis proposal passing will mean\n1. We diversify Orange treasury by swapping upto 10% of the $ORANGE supply or its successor token.\n2. Perform a 100x split of $ORANGE.\n--\n\nSingle Point of Contact: \nBen Huh\nSponsors: \nBen Huh, Don Ho, Orion Parrott, Johnny Chin, Berk Ozer, Mack McConnell, Ishan Goyal, Matt Voska, Fishy, Arthur Zubkoff, Colton Dillion, Jonathan Padilla, Cryptpal, Jamie Green, Alex Chumbley\n\nOverview:\nThis proposal commits Orange DAO to create a Digital Nation for Founders — a game-changing model to scale up our mission: To accelerate the builders and pioneers of Web3 by providing them with the resources, knowledge, and support they need to succeed.\n\nOrange DAO’s Digital Nation will organize the most ambitious and talented founders in the world into borderless, inclusive, and mutually beneficial communities. Our Digital Nation will be formally recognized by nation-states, regional governments, and its agencies so that we can co-create laws, programs, and regulations that support the growth of entrepreneurship — while deregulating the rules that create structural hurdles.\n\nIn order to become a Digital Nation, Orange DAO requires a clear commitment, additional resources, and a long-term track record of success to earn the trust of elected and career officials and analog communities. And like Orange DAO, a Digital Nation will continue to use tokens to govern itself and align the incentives of its citizens.\n\nThis OIP is the first step of many to fulfill our mission. It authorizes the DAO to:\nDiversify its treasury by swapping not more than 10% of the $ORANGE supply or its successor token.\nPerform a 100x split of $ORANGE.\n\nThis proposal is also a celebration of our remarkable co-creation to date — recognizing the fact that we have reached a significant milestone in the growth and maturation of who we are as a community and our collective earned experiences in pioneering community DAOs.\n\nThe 100x split of $ORANGE paves our way forward, allowing us to support a network orders of magnitude larger and greater than our dreams just 30 months ago.\n\nTo the future of Orange DAO’s Digital Nation!\n\nDetails:\nTreasury Diversification:\nTo be capped at a maximum of 10% of $ORANGE tokens.\nAuthorizes specific non-member wallets to hold and vote using DAO tokens.\n100x split of $ORANGE:\nAll $ORANGE token holders in good standing are eligible for the split.\nThis split increases the circulating token cap (maximum permissible number of tokens) to 10 billion from the current 100 million.\nIncrease the one-time initial token grant for founders who have successfully completed the Fellowship program to a pre-split amount of 5,000 $ORANGE (or its post-split equivalent).\nA retroactive grant to all previous Fellows who are also DAO members in good standing at the time of this proposal’s passing.\nThis split will require a change in the token used for DAO governance.\nThis does NOT change the method or model of the DAO’s governance.\nThe cost of executing this OIP (legal, regulatory, development, etc.) will be paid for by the Orange DAO Foundation or other DAO-supporting organizations.\n100% of tokens received from treasury diversification will go to DAO-related entities, such as Orange DAO Foundation in the Cayman Islands or multi-sig wallets controlled by the DAO.\nValue to the DAO:\nA diversified treasury:\nProvides immediate resources to continue the DAO’s mission.\nGives the DAO a source of endowment-like resources.\nUnlike startup capital, we plan to make these resources perform and last until the DAO can become a self-sufficient community.\nIs more resilient.\nBrings $ORANGE up-to-date with other DAOs and large token networks:\nThe most successful networks in web3 today are denominating their network in 1 billion to 10 billion in total circulating supply. This proposal calibrates Orange DAO to be on par with similar DAO networks. \nOrange DAO has ambitions to grow in size by 10x, 100x, or more by becoming a Digital Nation of Founders. Having a 10 billion supply of tokens allows us to grow our network to support these ambitions.\nThe post-split token will bring the $ORANGE token fully under the DAO’s control, rather than using a contract that is controlled by a third-party, as $ORANGE is today.\nIncreased size and diversified membership of the network.\nNon-member holders of $ORANGE (pre-/post-split) are respected and trusted members of the founder ecosystem. Enlarging our network to include them makes us stronger and more influential.\nSuccess Factors:\nCommitment from partners to complete the Treasury Diversification at terms acceptable to the DAO.\nTo successfully transition to a new post-split token, the DAO must execute a series of detailed operations in the correct sequence in a short period of time — like a challenging quest.\nAt the time of split, Orange DAO’s governance will transition to the new post-split token, while sunsetting the existing $ORANGE token to ensure proper governance.\n\n\nTokens Requested\n(Treasury Guidance)\nUnused tokens will be returned to the DAO. \nNo tokens are being used to pay sponsors or members (unless they are writing code).\nUSDC: Approximately $250,000 to pay for legal, transactional, and development costs. \nLegal estimate: $200,000 (US legal firm, plus any non-US foundation legal counsel)\nThe cost of documenting this round is not like a typical SAFE-like investment round. It requires custom services and documentation across multiple countries.\nDevelopers and auditing costs: $50,000\nAt least two smart contracts required: 1) New token, 2) Token Swap\nAuditing firm likely to be Quantstamp.\nDevelopers may be members of the DAO. To be decided later.\nETH: 0.5\n$ORANGE: None\n\nRISKS\n(Open to All Members)\nDepending on the failure mode, poor execution of either Treasury Diversification or split may make the existing tokens unusable or delay governance.\nIncreases token spend and lowers the DAO’s token balance before Treasury Diversification is successful.\nCOUNTERPOINTS\n(Open to All Members)\nToken split is not necessary to continue to operate the DAO.\nMany $ORANGE holders won’t redeem for new $ORANGE and they will be stuck with zero value tokens\nThere are 783 total $ORANGE holders. Without very careful management, the vast majority of these members won't redeem old for new.\nOver 200 members have done work for the DAO and been compensated with $ORANGE. For example, 197 members have over 10,373 tokens, which means at least part of their tokens came from work done for the DAO. I’m afraid many of them will lose their value because they’re unreachable or not paying attention.",

(300 words max.)\n\nI have served on a DAO committee every season. In S3, I'm currently a member of the Treasury Committe, making strategic decisions for the DAO. I also oversee tax preparation and compliance. I have set up vesting contracts with Orange Startup Liquifi. I have drafted the Season 4 budget that PCOM will collaborate on. I onboarded new accountants (Kranz) and tax preparation service providers (Moss Adams), going back through every on- and off-chain transaction that DAO has had since inception so that our accounting is air tight.\n\nWhat would you like to do in Season 4 to help Orange DAO and its members as part of the position you are applying for? (300 words max.)\n\nIn Season 4, we will move more activities on-chain by testing more financial software from Orange Startups to streamline further and decentralize the DAO finances. This includes payments, vesting contracts, and invoicing. We will increase the spead of payouts of earned Orange and show our members that this DAO is the rocketship they have been looking for. We will maintain compliant finances, provide weekly and monthly financial updates visible to all DAO members, and file taxes as needed. We will look for ways to reduce costs and improve the member experience by reducing overhead and hurdles of giving and getting compensation.\n\nWhat makes you the best candidate for the chosen position? (300 words max.)\n\nI have served on every DAO committee. As a general partner of the fund with a 10-year fiduciary commitment to our LPs, I am all in on Orange DAO. Since the fund will transfer 100% of the carry to Orange DAO, if the DAO is not successful, then the fund cannot be successful. I am a dedicated person willing to grind on the tactical actions required to make Orange DAO even more successful, in addition to exercising strategic leadership. I have no employment other than Orange DAO so my personal finances are highly aligned to the success of the DAO. I have an MBA and a Masters in Electrical Engineering. My objective is to set Orange DAO up for success as we grow into a digital nation that moves web3 forward to benefit our entire community to achieve the goals of decentralization. I also have a firm grasp on the details of the workings of the DAO and the path we have taken to get where we are. My decisions are informed by the history of Orange DAO and the experiments we have completed, both technical and social.",

(300 words max.)\n\nAs part of the Governance committee: \n- I dealt with a messy seasonal transition and letting go of a number of paid contributors. This led to us rethinking the process of contributor accountability and the introduction of the accountability framework (to be released in the end of the season);\n- I have prepared an election process and am currently managing it together with the Treasury team;\n- So far this season I have contributed to every proposal and the majority of initiatives/projects within the DAO.\n\nAs part of the Governance / Founder Success combined effort:\n- I have managed new member onboarding end to end;\n- I created the new member onboarding flow and collateral;\n- I have set up new process for charter signing and currently working on its integration into our existing products and processes (Passport/Grove etc.);\n- I have held over 30 feedback sessions with members - that’s one every 2-3 days this season!\n\nAs part of the Founder Success team:\n- I have been driving and exploring Member Benefits solutions like Orange Treasury Management to make Orange DAO the best private members club for builders in web3;\n- I am an Orange Buddy for two startups in the current Fellowship batch;\n- I am also an Orange Buddy for a number of other portcos.\n\nAs an Ecosystems team member:\n- I have helped drive forward and explore some of the potential partnerships (Aleo / Filecoin) \n- I was also very privileged to represent Orange DAO at ETHCC!\n\nAs a Dealflow team member:\n- I participated in a large number of reviews for the current batch of fellowship\n- I have been one of the top reviewers for the $100K investment deal (by number of calls/screens)\n\nWhat would you like to do in Season 4 to help Orange DAO and its members as part of the position you are applying for? (300 words max.)\n\nTwo things!  \n\n1. MAKE THINGS EVEN JUICIER! \n- Drive new ideas on making the DAO the best members club and builders DAO for founders in web3;\n- Finish what I have started this season and build an amazing member onboarding process;\n- Create a suite of exciting members benefits that will drive value to the members and to the DAO.\n- Continue contributing to Founder Success, Deal Flow, Ecosystems and Fellowship teams, as required by them.\n \n2. Make sure our Oranges are in order:\n- Streamline documentation, proposal and voting processes. Continue learning best governance practices and implementing them at Orange DAO;\n- Set the DAO for success in the future bull market by iterating and finding an optimal structure for its operations based on member feedback;\n- Continue building a culture of competition, transparency and positivity for the DAO through new proposals and initiatives (i.e. Accountability, Orange Diplomatic Network etc.);\n- Make sure old and new members are happy, heard by the DAO and involved with us through ongoing feedback sessions and member/portco support.\n- And generally, support new and existing teams with a Governance process that works!\n\n\nWhat makes you the best candidate for the chosen position? (300 words max.)\n\nAs a current Governance Committee member I am making a conscious effort to contribute to a number of different teams across the DAO including, Deal Flow, Founder Success, Ecosystems and, of course, Governance in order to be exposed to a wide variety of initiatives and teams.\n\nI believe that my skills, knowledge of Orange DAO (and Web3 in general), as well as the experience of being on the Governance Committee in Season 3 makes me uniquely positioned to excel in the Governance Operations position.\n\nIf I am elected, I will not only work on required responsibilities as described in the JD, but will scale the ones I have been successfully doing in S3! Imagine getting two Ferraris for the price of one! Good deal, huh?",

In S1, I co-drafted the new seasonal budget system, the T-shirt size compensation process, set up the DAO Foundation, and improved the speed and process for sending tokens to teams and members. I believe that the Treasury's responsibilities are to serve the needs of the rest of the DAO and I am grateful to be able to do that. In Season 2, I look forward to helping more people accomplish their goals faster by playing a supporting role here, while helping teams generate more revenue and fun!\n\nMaqq\nI’m currently on Treasury and want to continue on for Season 2. My heart is in this 🧡. I led the Treasury on many cold start problems, incl. trxns of 3.7M $ORANGE to 230+ members, OIP-1, 2, 18, 29 and Fund 0 LP distro. Passionate about improving systems to pay contributors faster (currently leading Fast Track Comp. test), more equitably and transparency. Excited for new problems like treasury diversification, improving consistency and speed of compensation. Let’s keep it juicy Orange DAO!\n\nIamdonho\nI’m currently serving on the Treasury Committee and would like to continue creating standards for DAO treasuries everywhere. In addition to serving as GP of Orange Fund, I lead the Partnerships team, the main driver of revenue for the DAO ($30M + in revenue). I am running to productize the DAO treasury’s first source of recurring revenue: DeFi as a Service. Many members and startups have asked for treasury management from DeFi and Orange DAO’s treasury team has an unfair advantage with access to proprietary yields. \n",

I have been the major driver for the recent Venture Team initiatives including: monthly help request report, portco support 2.0 plan, talent portal, urgent help requests, portco activities tracking, portco listing, 1-on-1 portco onboarding calls, and outreach for our portcos. I am also experienced with team building which is crucial for a new organization like ours. I’m running because I believe the Programs Committee can play a crucial part in accelerating our portco support initiatives. \n\noparrott.eth\nI’m nominating myself for the Programs Committee in Orange DAO Season 2. Vote for me to select seasoned DAO leadership. \n- Served on Season 0 Treasury Committee\n- Served on Season 1 Governance Committee\n- Founder of Orange DAO and Fund. \n- 10-year full-time commitment to Orange Fund as Managing General Partner. Raised a $50M fund that brings 100% of carry into the DAO treasury. Established the legal framework and leading fund operations.\nMy Programs Committee Goals for Season 2:\n- Plan to propose revenue producing products and services roll up to this committee to give them the technical and programmatic support they need.\n- Work with the various teams and committees to identify internal product roadmaps that will help the DAO achieve our goals in Season 2 and beyond.\n- Partner with Governance and Treasury Committees to operationalize the DAO around key mission and vision statements.\n- I will ensure that this committee helps teams and committees know what to expect from the DAO in terms of technical resources, product management for both internal and public goods.\n- Work with onboarding so people know where they can contribute.\n- Establish best practices for all DAO users to contribute their skills, whether part time, on-demand, and for higher levels of commitment.\n\nSanketc\nI have served on the onboarding subcommittee in season 1 where I redesigned the onboarding process such that any new member has to have an initial touchpoint to improve their likelihood of activating. I also just started spearheading the work on Starter Pack with the goal of generating more revenue in the future(through partnership money), and incentivizing more new members to engage early on. I have also hosted a couple of IRL events in NYC, and am driving a proposal right now to get us a physical space in NYC! \nI am a builder at heart, and currently work on a product that powers multiple web3 discord communities. Through this, I do have a good sense of what other products, and tools exist in the ecosystem that we can leverage to automate aspects of our workflows.\nMy goals for season 2:\n- Activate new members: Through onboarding work, I have realized a lot of members want to contribute but in its current form it feels overwhelming. I want to work with the onboarding team to create a consolidated view of active projects, and tasks where they can contribute. I want to empower project owners to mark tasks that new members can pick up. \n- Clear process to fund new / existing projects: Put a system in place where we review new projects through a stage gate process to ensure we continue fund projects that work, and adjust resources when its not working\n- Consistent short term project compensation process - any projects that want short term dev help will follow this process to engage an existing DAO member (or external member). We can also explore partnering with an agency that can provide us ad hoc development support.  \n",

I can bring my knowledge to help us organize and rally our members around a solidified core vision, and then work with our members to align on objectives, creating playbooks around equitable compensation for our members, supporting our portfolio founders, and paving a path to Orange liquidity – allowing us to give YC web3 founders the foundation to change the world. I’m also an OrangeDAO Fellow, and sponsor of OIP-59 to bring OrangeDAO IRL spaces to life.\n\n\nMrMemes\nI’m currently serving the DAO on the development committee and have been an engaged and contributing member since Season 0. During Season 1 I proposed and helped pass a major initiative to provide engineering support for the DAO. A major area of my focus in Season 1 has been establishing process to provide continuity, handing over role responsibilities season over season. I’d like the opportunity to continue working on this effort from the perspective of the overall governance of the DAO. I’m also keenly interested in working on increasing member engagement with proposals and voting, which is integral to the governance committee\n\n\n\nIsaiahudotong.eth\nI’m currently serving the DAO on the Proposals sub-committee under Governance. In my role I interviewed & brainstormed with dozens of members and worked on making proposals/voting easier. I’ve implemented several improvements with support of various members, and I’m nearing completion on a new Proposal flow in tandem with our Portco: Charmverse. In completing this process, I have a good sense of how members would like a healthy balancing decentralization, $ORANGE mobility, and clarity of vision/direction. I plan to help build a smaller DAO flywheeel with clear early reward incentives for members that work on DAO objectives.\n",

This proposal addresses payment for this group of individuals without having to submit individual proposals.\n\nThe DAO is working towards making compensation a more comprehensive, protocol-based process.

Maqq is fulfilling the role of a Treasury sub-committee member alongside being a treasury committee member.\nMaqq has also been involved in various projects across the DAO (e.g. L1 partnerships proposal etc) which would be considered outside of the treasury, where he shows up and makes things better!\n\nMr Memes\nWorked on a security exploit with charter signing. 3 wks of full time engineering effort.\n\nPraful\nPMing & some backend work on security exploit project with charter signing.\n\nRoland\nAssisted with early due-diligence & data cleanup in original dealflow google sheet\nPlanned, promoted & co-hosted new-to-crypto chat with Ben\nOIP-15 meeting, planning, execution, and retro. Proposal was passed, however decided that it didn’t make sense to move forward (and hence the team wasn’t paid out anything)\n\nSarina\nMarketing efforts contributor (brand document, external messaging document etc.)\n\nBenefits:\nCompensation for work on one-off projects, events, etc. incentivizes members to take on a more active role in the DAO, continue contributing to projects, and work on bigger projects. \nCompensation for work encourages members to become more active contributors/core contributors. \nA handful of core contributors from S0 have been absent in S1. We want to compensate members for their work in a way that also incentivizes contributions to the DAO. \n\nSuccess Metrics:\n5+ Orange members completing the survey to get retroactive compensation\n\nDuration:\nThis is a compensation OIP. It is intended to be executed as soon as it is passed.\n\nTokens Requested: (Treasury control) (Treasury Guidance)\nTreasury will directly distribute tokens following the t-shirt size compensation model. \n\nFAQ:\nIf this proposal covers all past work, does that mean there will be no other ways to get comp for retro work? \nAs the charter stands today, members of the DAO are welcome to create proposals at any point to request $ORANGE. However, it would be reasonable for any member requesting comp for retro work to expect pushback from the DAO and have clear reasoning as to why the work was not included as part of this OIP.\n\nRISKS: (Open to All Members)\n\nCOUNTERPOINTS: (Open to All Members)\n\n\nADMIN: FOR TREASURY: \nTransactions Upon Passing:\nContributor\nTokens Requested\nWallet Addresses\nENS\nArian\nL (30K)\n0x0d48774F178E38645187A2a8aB3c940fB20A27C4\n\n\nBeth\nXS (2.5K)\n0xA581CF5B5502f9B4E86e849c9d1223E45D08243D\n\n\nByron\nXXL (75K)\n0x596c338EC101a8a01ee5c0B0629293703fDe8d33\n0xbyron.eth\nDavid Head\nS (5K)\n0x16D56FA9b31479315a05b0b31F83D88f5F8Ca6e4\ndavidh.eth \nEnx\nXL (55K)\n0x7d25cb84cdfbdaf9a35df24be0a854e4d9d96f9d\nenx.eth \nIrina\nS (5K)\n0xcF49AC4184Be30518d70454b7C9a0cf3c868a725\n\n\nJP Ren\nL (30K)\n0x4079D0a200129BaeeaD1a12Ac1C8641f1439a152\n\n\nKrel\nL (30K)\n0xA86882277E69FbF0a51805cdc8b0a3a113079E63\n\n\nLeigh\nXS (2.5K)\n0x13993699c83124Bd53737a9C132B055A366D6f03\n\n\nMaqq\nXL (55K)\n0x170D32fa0872011c4f9879033534EF8Cec0758E8\n\n\nMr Memes\nM (15K)\n0x9e1E2Bc60E0fdC756704d18346D511Bba7543E9a\nmrmemes.eth\nPraful\nS (5K)\n0x994956E8c7D3D65B7cE323c8094B964a1bac95dE\n\n\nRoland\nS (5K)\n0x722cF4Ba3b8B3105AE8878c58145bD3b0AaD629C\n\n\nSarina\nS (5K)\n0x6a5e19214F49e1A1E119B78B7FC97eCd06187A0f\n\n\nTotal\n323K\n",

Do not include folks who are just supportive of this proposal. \n@oparrott, @iamdonho\n\nDescription:\n\nDAO Member Loans\nThree DAO members (@huh.eth, @oparrott, and @iamdonho) have personally advanced cash for DAO operations since January 2022. Now that the DAO has enough funds in the treasury, we should repay these loans and pay outstanding legal fees of the DAO.\n\nGiven the nature and tempo of the DAO, we expect more needs for short-term lending in the future. We would be happy to continue to make loans to the DAO when the need and urgency arises.\n\nThe details of the loans and the interest calculations are here:\nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1To1gN37Yyd3o_LDfM2RCheilsnAf0equIO9ozA-cub4/edit#gid=1761874068\n(Note: The IRS requires that any loans above $10K be charged a minimum federal interest rate or pay a penalty. That’s why there is a 3% simple interest added to the balance, totalling $1,829.69. However, given that the three of us are not here to make money on interest, we’ll be spending it on DAO member events.)\n\nThese loans covered spending by the DAO as a result of proposals that have passed as well as foundational operating costs like software.\n\nThe repayment of principal and interest can be sent via USDC on ETH Mainnet and will occur as soon as the stable coin balance is available to Treasury — estimated around 8/15. If the payment occurs later, the interest calculation will need to be adjusted, and this proposal authorizes that additional nominal amount. If the payment occurs sooner, less.\n\nLatham and Watkins legal fees for services to the DAO\nLatham and Watkins is the Orange DAO and Orange DAO Foundation legal counsel.

      "content": "Full proposal here: \nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1UrTa9zadu9YfzJRvxYIlcqgKVPgXlbOX7QpnFdNPn7o/edit#\n\nGoal: Pilot the first physical space for Orange DAO in an amazing location where members and portfolio companies can cowork and host events.\n\nSingle Point of Contact: @oparrott.eth\n\nSponsors: @cryptpal, @JeffShaw, @oparrott.eth\n\nDescription: This proposal enables the DAO to rent a pilot hacker space from a fellow DAO member. The San Francisco location will be just the first pilot of many hacker houses around the world.\n\nDesign Requirements\n\nVibe: Down to earth, not too corporate. A good place for friendly vibes, more like a house, high end but low key. \nSize: 2,000-5,000 square feet. We want to start small so that we can fill the space and not spend too much or have it look empty. \nPotential Uses: Orange DAO co-working, regular and special events up to 150 people, possibly co-living. \nOwnership: Partnerships or Venture Team can establish an Hacker House Team to handle access, use, finances, and operations at the property.\nFinancial: The plan is to rent before owning. Taking one step at a time, finding what works. Purchasing a property in the future may become a reality but it is outside the scope of this proposal. Initial target budget $10-30K USD/month. \nTimeline: Season 1 and beyond. We plan to continue having a physical (IRL) space for Orange DAO and portfolio companies to meet, play, and work together indefinitely. Ceasing to have an Orange IRL Hacker House can be decided by future proposal.\n\nTarget Property\n\n580 Howard St, Penthouse Level\nProperty video: https://vimeo.com/725500116 \nProperty photos: https://app.photobucket.com/u/cloudfortress/a/31d79660-0dd4-4d61-bcec-254c5585242e \n3D Walkthrough & more details: www.cloudfortress.org \n\nOrange DAO Member Jeff Shaw (YC W15) has offered his company’s former office. \n\nSpace: High-tech furnished penthouse is turnkey with over 6,000 sf (3,500+ indoor and 2,500+ outdoor private terrace), with vaulted ceilings and expansive open spaces. Nature and sunlight span both the indoor and outdoor areas of this penthouse.\nProperty: This penthouse has several open areas and private spaces, including a vaulted-ceiling co-working space, as well as several office suites and bedroom suites. As you enter the secure building, the elevator opens directly to our private penthouse floor. We have the entire top floor of the building, with luxury amenities and \"one of San Francisco's best views\". The views can be seen from each private office's private terrace patio gardens, as well as from our giant communal wraparound terrace which include a hot tub overlooking the downtown city lights, a plush Orange-cushioned firepit lounge, an edible vegetable garden, and a putting green. Inside the building are 20 foot vaulted ceilings with skylights, a full-size bar, and a commercial-grade kitchen with all top-of-the-line appliances (Sub-Zero refrigerator, Viking range and indoor grill, dual-Gaggenau convection ovens), as well as a fully stocked kitchen with snack dispensers, reach-in drinks drawers, and appliances such as a Breville barista-grade espresso maker. The property already comes well-equipped with dinnerware, flatware, and glassware for 40+ guests. The space also includes a large 400sf storage garage. \nLocation: In the heart of downtown San Francisco’s East Cut / SOMA district, our property overlooks the brand new Salesforce Park botanical gardens, and is walking-distance to hundreds of San Francisco's best restaurants, bars, nightclubs, VC firms, and tech offices such as Facebook, Google, LinkedIn, and more. It is just a couple blocks from the Embarcadero, providing walking access to waterfront piers to take in the views of the sparkling Bay Bridge, the Ferry Building, and the world-famous weekly Farmers Market. It is also just a couple minute walk to the Metreon, Westfield Mall, movie theaters, the Museum of Modern Art, comedy clubs, and the Yerba Buena Gardens and waterfall. The building has a Transit Score of 100, providing unparalleled access to BART, MUNI, buses, and more. Bike lanes flank the area making it a bike riders paradise. There is also substantial street parking, parking lots, and parking garages on the block. This is in a special East Cut SOMA subdivision which has a safety and cleanliness patrol of the area providing all of San Francisco's best attractions in a safe and clean environment.\nJeff will continue to occupy a (live-work) bedroom suite attached to the penthouse. He has offered to operate the building to make it turnkey for us. This improves security and ease of use. He’s already familiar with the property and how to care for it. Maintenance and cleaning teams are already established with known costs.\nRent: $15K USD (inclusive of rent, HOA, water, sewer, trash, gas, high-speed internet). This top-level penthouse could rent for $30,000 at full market rate but we have exclusive access to it through our network. \nAvailability: Now. \n\nDiligence Process\n\nOrion has owned and managed rental properties for 23 of the last 25 years. He is a partner in a real estate fund that restores and operates historic mansions in the Berkshires of Massachusetts. \n\nIn search of the perfect Orange DAO Hacker House, Orion and Don have visited 25+ San Francisco area properties in person since February. We worked with commercial brokers at https://ipgsf.com/. This gave us a sense of the market dynamics in 2022H1 and the prices per square foot in neighborhoods including the Mission, SOMA, and downtown. A list of comparable properties from these brokers is available on request. This extensive search has informed our view of what we need in a property (see Description) and what we expect to pay. Based on these recent and local market explorations, we have selected Jeff’s property at 580 Howard St as the top choice. \n\nBenefits:\nMeeting in person with fellow Orange DAO members.\nHot desks for members.\nAssigned desks for contributors or based on ORANGE or other DAO criteria\nEstablishing our culture in person.\nProvide valuable office/desk space to Orange DAO portfolio company founders. \nBuild awareness for Orange DAO within the YC community for example by allowing any alumni to hot desk if they join the DAO, subject to availability.\nHost our own regular and special events, including demo days or mini conferences in our own physical space that represents who we are. \nSet up our world headquarters. \nThe Venture Team and in fact any Orange DAO Team can take meetings in person in San Francisco with startups, venture funds, investors, etc. \n\nCandidate Success Metrics, subject to Hacker House Team adjustment:\nNumber of monthly users grows over time up to capacity (both DAO and portcos). \nNumber of monthly web3 Portcos supported. \nValuable SF office space is acquired and made available to the DAO for coworking for short term (travelers, hot desks) and long term (founding teams). \nData is gathered on improved portco outcomes, additional deal flow, brand awareness, and new DAO membership that can be used to decide to create IRL nodes in other cities. \nEvents and coworking reservations are teed up in advance. \nPrioritized goals of Venture Team, Partnerships, and permanent committees are executed on consistently. \nA system of fair access is built for all members of the DAO.\n\nSuccess Confidence: \n(If this proposal was executed 100 times, how many times will it meet its goal?)\n95%\n\nDuration:\nStart: During Season 1 (August 2022)\nEnd: Until terminated by proposal.\n\nTokens Requested: (Treasury control) (Treasury Guidance)\n$ORANGE Total: 40,000/year\nFor Hacker House Team: up to 15,000/season to be spent as needed\nFor property operations by Jeff Shaw: 5,000 $ORANGE/season\n$USDC Total: $230,000/year + $50K initial improvement budget ($23.3K/mo total over 12 months)\nRent: $15,000/mo = $180,000/year\nJanitorial: $1,500/mo = $18,000/year\nEvents hosting (staff, catering): $0. Covered under Partnerships S1 budget.\nFood and Beverage: $20,000/yr\nInsurance: $3,000/yr\nInternet: $0 (included in rent)\nGas: $0 (included in rent)\nElectricity: $9,000/yr\nImprovements: $50,000 (one time)\n\nToken Distribution: (Sponsors’ control)\n$ORANGE\nJeff Shaw: Up to 5,000 per Season until terminated\nHacker House Team: Up to 15,000 per Season until terminated\nProposal writing: 0 to oparrott.eth. \n$USDC\n$280,000 in year 1, $230,000 after until terminated\n$ETH\nGas money for signatories of Hacker House Team wallet: 0.5. If less, return to DAO.\n\nRISKS: (Open to All Members)\nBy oparrott.eth\nWe have way too much demand for coworking space and can’t satisfy all our members.\nMitigation: We can always rent additional locations as we grow, or replace this one with a larger one. \nBy arian\nwith people in a physical space, what's the liability / who is liable here? the dao / llc / fund? I wouldn't want something crazy to go down in a rager and have the dao be liable / negative press for it.\nMitigation (offered by Orion): We will have renters insurance. This risk applies for any DAO events whether at a leased space or short term rental.\n\nCOUNTERPOINTS: (Open to All Members)\nBy oparrott.eth\nWe don’t know where the real estate market is headed.\nResponse: This is why we are renting. Also, this property is an inside deal from a DAO member and represents one of the best opportunities on world class real estate that fits our budget and vibe.\nBy oparrott.eth\nBut it’s not crypto.\nResponse: This first pilote node of a physical space is an important step towards becoming a digital nation. This can help legitimize the function and operations of DAOs.\nBy arian\n5% of annual cashflow is substantial\nResponse: I had to remove the 5% because we expect a few more $M next week. Not that having money means we should spend it. But let's consider this proposal against alternative uses of cash flow. \nBy arian\nCan we get monthly metrics sent around in discord with attendance / efforts being made to increase engagement?\nI’ve heard other communities, in SF specifically, have trouble getting people to not wfh. In NYC it’s not a problem but SF people are just not going in.\nResponse: This proposal is about whether we should rent a space. Reasons for and against metrics have been offered by members of the DAO. Candidate metrics have been proposed for the Hacker House Team to develop.\nBy arian\nHow many people are committed? Should we have a baseline of 15 to be willing to put this up as a proposal? \nResponse: Anyone can propose. No need to treat this proposal differently from other proposals. \nBy arian\nHow many people need to have a higher NPS as result of this? Is it 100 and if so are we willing to spend $2500/pp to get their increased NPS? How will we get that 100?\nResponse: Aiming for the whole DAO to benefit.\n\n\n",

      "content": "Full proposal here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fyNRIOek1PTMmP8ZL_250xQGxMBRRWSCrP56t9p5P6o/edit#heading=h.3bs9563px4gi\n\nGoal:\nContinue and expand on Orange Podcast based on our learnings from first 5 episodes pilots (OIP-39 here: OIP-58: Orange DAO Media Division - Google Docs) \n\n\nSingle Point of Contact: (Only 1 individual for GovC to reach out with questions, and to represent at TownHall.)\n@jamdac\n\nSponsors: Include folks planning to work on this proposal. Do not include folks who are just supportive of this proposal. \n@jamdac, @ryanbed, @sarina \n\nDescription:\n\nOrange Media is how we speak to the world on a deeper level. It’s how we tell our stories, convey our ideas and bring others along in the MOVEMENT with us. It’s different from the daily twitter/Instagram, although they intersect at times. \n\nOrange Media establishes us as more than just another DAO, but a complex organization with a lofty mission and our own values/viewpoints. \n\nTo put it differently - we are building Orange DAOs version of A16Z’s Future (https://future.com/), helping any person navigate and understand Web3 and join our nation of builders. Orange Media is the foundation for Orange DAO to share its knowledge as a public good to the world, with the help of those at the cutting edge of Web3. \n\nWe believe that Orange DAO needs a media division to create and distribute exciting content to the outside world. Orange Media will be Orange DAOs in-house media machine. The MVP in this proposal will cover podcasts, blogs, and building Orange Media. \n\nAfter completing a successful pilot for the Orange Podcast - we wanted to rapidly scale our ambition.\n\nThe podcast pilot was successful, delivering (with only organic sharing): \n6 episodes (including 2 pre-recorded): 4 DAO members: huh.ben, cyptpalsingh, James Sinka, Orion; 2 external speakers - Brett (YC 08) Partner @ Initialized & Amira Head of Policy @ Solana Foundation \nHundreds of listens (final count to be updated)\n100+ retweets \nGeneral excitement within the DAO as members got to know each other better and started conversations around the topics shared. We also saw thoughtful engagement on Twitter around each episode.  \n\nKey elements: \nThe Orange Media Organization: the preeminent media organization in the web3 space \nOur learning: media is one of the easiest things to get OrangeDAO noticed on twitter. Easy to share/re-share, getting high-profile attention, and building our brand in the most thoughtful way. \nThe Orange Podcast: a high end production podcast interviewing leaders in the space of crypto (this would compete with the likes of Bankless) \nOur learning: We can actually pull some pretty big-name guests because of the Orange brand and YC affiliation! We already have interest from a handful of big-name guests. \nHumans of Orange: an internal focused podcast, which will overtime interview every member of Orange DAO\nOur learning: Internal guests are interesting but require more prep/media training so we will have to structure these episodes differently (more like a talk show perhaps / conversation). These are great for people to get to know the DAO better and feel accessible / share our vision and should be interspersed throughout. We can also do these episodes more frequently and with less prep since we know the folks. \nOrange blogs: Orange DAO medium/ blog platform to share thought leadership on all things Web3\nOur learning: the tools we use for the pod can, without too much extra effort, help us convert to text for the original blog posts and then we can build blog posts on top of that perhaps by crowdsourcing articles from the DAO.  \n\nBenefits:\n\nLONG TERM: We want to be a top 10 crypto podcast in 1-2 years in order to position ourselves as thought leaders and grow our brand. To do that, we have to start now! This is getting our Brand to the outside world: awareness of what the DAO is, of Orange DAO as thought leaders in the space, of Orange DAO as a place for builders. This is the way we get the word out about ODAO and it has a lot of other halo effects. \n\nWe do the above through interviewing high-profile, external guests. \n\nNEAR TERM: Humans of Orange Podcast where we interview our portcos as well as folks internal to the DAO. This gives them a platform and also helps increase/grease member engagement as folks have a place to go to get to know each other more deeply. \n\nIn addition the proposal offers a number of key benefits including eyes on the DAO, a pipeline for future investments/ partnerships, and the opportunity for revenue generation in the future by setting the groundwork now. The Media Division also provides a great point for non Orange members to interact with Orange DAO. \n\n\n\n\nTop-line attention for the DAO (by the end of Season 1)\n10,000 listens \n5,000 blog page views \n5,000 Twitter followers (contributing to the DAOs goal of doubling followers)\n8 major speakers engaged \n\nExamples of intangible benefits:\nPositioning ourselves as the no1 DAO for web3 builders: Through the podcast & blogs we have the opportunity to meaningfully engage with Web3 builders every week - digitizing the great experience of some of our in-person parties & meetups \nUnderstanding of the DAO: from friends, family and players in the space \nInvestments: intro to cool companies from guests; active inbound from external listeners\nProjects: pursuing new ideas that bubble up the surface on the podcast \nPartnerships: Opportunity to showcase our existing partners (NEAR) and collaborate with new partners (e.g. Bankless) \n\nFuture DAO revenue generation: (Orange Media could be self funding one day) - but this is outside of the scope of the proposal\nPartnerships: co-creating content with current & new partners \nAdvertising: media sponsorships\nMonetization of listens: token-gated access\n\nTeam: \nRyan has been an SEO wizard for a decade\nSarina is HBS grad, former GM at Funding Circle in the US\nJames is a neobank founder & has grown/ managed multiple communities, with a personal following of 50,000+ (Insta, Twitter, Linkedin)\n\n\nThe Orange Podcast: Major tier 1 podcast, aiming to be chart topping (top 10 in Web3) \nMajor speakers confirmed (80%): Axie Infinity Founder, Alexis (Reddit founder), Balaji (intro from Johnny), A16Z partners\nWith a hitlist of exciting speakers who we could pull in: Vitalik Buterin, Jack Dorsey, etc \n\nHumans of Orange: In our initial pilot we have already proved there is sold external interest in humans of Orange\nGet to know any member of Orange DAO\nGo deep on specific topics from DAO portfolio companies and members e.g. DeSci, ReFi, Passport \n\nOrange blogs: \nTopical summaries/ blog posts of episode transcripts & themes covered \n\nCompensation: \n90K $Orange: 1 major T-shirt size for each member for the season (30k Orange) \n90K $Orange:  Orange upside for hitting KPIs:\n10k (per team lead) if 5,000 listens hit\nAdditional 10k (per team lead) if 10,000 listens hit \nAdditional 10k (per team lead) if 25,000 listens hit \n10K $Orange: for blog contributors and future team members\n\nSuccess Metrics:\nKPIs before proposal: \nEpisodes: 6 pilot episodes\nListens: 500 listens\nKPIs after proposal:\nEpisodes/ blogs: (24) - \n8 Orange Pod episodes\n16 Humans of Orange episodes \n24 blogs\nViews/ Listens - \n10,000 listens  \n5,000 blog page hits \n+5,000 followers: Twitter following doubled during Season (podcast as a contributor)\nSuccess Confidence: \n(If this proposal was executed 100 times, how many times will it meet its goal?)\n70%\n\nDuration:\nStart: Season 1\nProposal end: Season 1 (for the proposal)\nOrange Media end: Enduring\n\nTokens Requested: (Treasury control) (Treasury Guidance)\n$ORANGE Total: 190,000\nFor Team Leads: 90,000 \nIf KPIs are met: 90,000 \nFor blog post contributors: 10,000\n$USDC Total: 10,000\nFor professional production of external podcast: 6000\nFor Expenses: 2000 (microphones & software) \nFor Marketing and asset creation: 2000\n\nToken Distribution: (Sponsors’ control)\n$ORANGE\nSarina: 30,000 \nRyan: 30,000\nJames: 30,000\nBonus pool contingent on listening metrics hit: 90,000 (split evenly across James, Ryan, Sarina)\n$ETH\nPay for swap fees: 0:05.

Why do we need OM? In general I agree we do (sooner or later) but what is the answer? Why do we want more people to know about us? Who should know about us? How does that help? Is this the right time? What’s the bigger why.  My best answer to this is \"for better dealflow\". How else might the DAO benefit? Bc there are probably easier ways to get more dealflow. And we are not even ready to market for more dealflow because we are still building the systems to be ready to handle more.\t",

      "content": "Full Proposal here: \nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1DiCpLE6_dr_DZTzpPjcBV7-2j9j6GQAfDSAXgx1FK3g/edit#heading=h.3bs9563px4gi\n\nGoal:\nCompensate for creating v1 of Grove: a “Bookface for Orange” internal app for verified Orange members to interact and engage.\n\nSingle Point of Contact: (Only 1 individual for GovC to reach out with questions, and to represent at TownHall.)\n@Byron#4552 \n\nSponsors: Include folks planning to work on this proposal. Do not include folks who are just supportive of this proposal. \nn/a\n\nDescription:\nBackground\nThe value of Orange DAO’s network effect relies on the ability for Members to interact in meaningful ways.  Discord is great for chatting but the firehose of information is too much to consume for most people, and information is hard to track once posted.\n\nPreviously, Orange lacked a home-base for verified Members to interact and engage with each other.  Bookface solves this need for YC, and I believe that Orange needed something similar. The delivery of OIP-18 was the spark that spurred the need for a place for Members to view PortCo help requests.  However, it seemed unlikely that Members would check it solely for that reason; everyone is busy and supporting PortCos is not the top priority for most people.  I wanted to create more reason for Members to log in regularly and engage with the DAO.  \n\nIn parallel, there arose multiple other opportunities to better manage existing features (such as contact settings), or test new ideas being thrown out, or opportunities to re-create Bookface-like features (such as a member directory or deals).  Because one of the most valuable resources of the DAO is Member attention, it is helpful to consolidate as many activities as possible into one place.  By adding multiple functionalities into one platform, we can encourage more people to open and use the platform.  While they are using one feature, they are likely to check out the others.  This led to the creation of Grove. \n\nGrove is built on a low-code platform called Stacker, so it is fast to develop but relatively inflexible. If deemed worthwhile by the DAO, Grove v1 could be replaced in the future by a more flexible v2 platform that supports wallet-login. This would be a large undertaking. In the meanwhile, I see Grove v1 as a functional prototype that does solve the immediate needs of a DAO Member home base.\n\nIt is also a place where any Orange Members can prototype and launch their ideas as well. Multiple apps can be launched within the same workspace, without sharing app or data-level information. For example, the house-swap proposal, or many others, could launch as a separate app within the workspace. \n\nIMPORTANT: Please note that this OIP is strictly covering the Grove features which are not related to PortCo support. It only covers where work extended beyond the requirements of OIP-18. \nIt is also not covering the Orange Fund Dealflow App, which is built in Stacker as a separate app under the same workspace, and will be part of a broader Fund-related OIP. \nDeliverables\nThe following features are already completed and live within Grove:\nGeneral purpose internal app \nmember login\nextensible features\npermission management\ncustomized UI (within constraints)\nOnboarding\nSync previous onboarding process to Grove database\nData cleaning for member data\nCreate new streamlined one-step onboarding form that leads to Grove database\nCreate API endpoint to translate ENS addresses into full Ethereum addresses\nCreate API endpoint and automations that check on-chain Polygon data to verify GEM holding and update member database. \nSecure Grove by requiring the GEM NFT to be held in the member-provided wallet.  \nMembers\nDAO Members profile to update bio, interest areas, skills, communication preferences, demographic data, etc\nDAO Member Directory.  View fellow Orange Members, learn about them.\nOffice hours direct-booking of Members that opt-in and provide calendar + topics to speak on\nCollect sign-ups for DAO Chat Roulette 1:1 rotating system support. Collect interest, export data via airtable for manual matching.\nGather demographic data for Orange diversity targets\nCollect interest in various IRL events\nCollect interest in angel investing opportunities (ie Orange Fund co-investments)\nConsolidate Member cities into useful buckets and display in-profile\nCreate training content for Members to use Grove App\nGrove usage guide for Members\nHelp videos on Grove welcome page\nDeals page, general deal submission form, deal-adding capability for PortCos. Solicit PortCos for deals\nCreate and help populate a Projects page, to centralize all active projects within Orange into one visible place where Members can see how to contribute. \n\nThe following features are underway but only ~80% complete:\nWallet-login?: Attempting to integrate Auth0 SSO and Sign-in With Ethereum into Grove.  Determine if wallet login is possible within Stacker Grove v1, or not.  Have been working with Stacker to test, awaiting final steps. \nInvestor Database: create the infrastructure and import existing known data to create an investor database for Web3\n\nThe following are non-building but time consuming activities that have been conducted through S0 and into S1:\nFrequent small debugging and iterations\nSupporting Members with login difficulties or other Grove usage questions\n\nThe following activities, not yet completed, will help to upskill other Orange Members to contribute to Grove:\nCreation of training videos on data structure, permission configurations, and other information specific to Grove\nHosting 3 live training / co-development sessions for core contributors on how to use Stacker and contribute to Grove, or add their own new apps into the workspace. \nAsync support for future Grove/Stacker contributors through S1\n\nBenefits:\nImprove inter-DAO communication and coordination\nImproved security over insecure alternatives such as public Airtable views or gDocs\nEncourage Member networking and meaningful connections\nSave $ORANGE by providing a platform to test DAO products / features in a low-cost way to verify adoption before investing in larger builds\n\nSuccess Metrics (to date):\nPercentage of Members logged into Grove and set up their profile (currently >=75 Members have done so)\nNumber of Deals entered by the end of S1 (currently 5)\nNumber of Projects listed by end of S1 (currently 17)\nNumber of additional Stacker-capable devs by end of S1 (currently 0 known)\n\nDuration:\nStart: During Season 0\nEnd: 6/1/2022\n\nTokens Requested: (Treasury control) (Treasury Guidance)\nCompensation Approach: \nRegarding compensation for this OIP, I would like to experiment with Value-Spectrum Voting to discover the best compensation amount that reflects the DAO Members’ preferences. My hope is to pilot a more fair and transparent process that could potentially be a model for some future proposals (where it makes sense). \n\nI would put forth the following options:\n0 $ORANGE\n65,000 $ORANGE\n85,000 $ORANGE\n105,000 $ORANGE\n125,000 $ORANGE\n145,000 $ORANGE\n165,000 $ORANGE\n185,000 $ORANGE\n205,000 $ORANGE\n225,000 $ORANGE\n245,000 $ORANGE\n265,000 $ORANGE\n285,000 $ORANGE\n\nWe can set up Snapshot with simple Single choice voting. And then we can use Value-Spectrum Voting to determine the best compensation according to Orange Member preferences.\nCompensation Calculation\nTime-based Portion\n65,000 $ORANGE total for creating and supporting the system through Season 1\n35,000 for Grove features already live and completed\n15,000 to complete remaining features (test wallet-login and build investor database)\n10,000 for non-building support activities\n5,000 for upskilling and training activities\nValue-based Portion\nThe additional amounts above 65k are meant to allow the DAO to express how much additional compensation should be given for value creation or other intangible benefits, if any.  \n\nToken Distribution: (Sponsors’ control)\n$ORANGE\n[Name1]: 3.3334\n[Name2]: 3.3333\n[Name3]: 3.3333\nSwapped to $USDC: 90\n$ETH\nPay for swap fees: 0:05. If less, will be returned to DAO.\n\nRISKS: (Open to All Members)\nByron: Grove may not achieve enough traction to be meaningful\nByron: Limitations of building Grove in a constrained low-code platform\n\nCOUNTERPOINTS: (Open to All Members)\nByron: I believe there is already substantial traction that is a minority of members, but is already providing value\nByron: There is definitely a risk of redundant effort, if we decide to rebuild Grove into a more powerful platform down the road.  However, I do not believe this effort is wasted, as we’ll have gained valuable insight into what features are truly being used. Thus even failed products are providing value by saving larger development effort down the road. \nByron: I also recognize the drawbacks of requiring email to log into Grove.  Aside from researching wallet-login, I do believe in the meanwhile this is an acceptable tradeoff as we don’t have any true anons in Orange, and people can provide anonymous emails if desired. \n\nADMIN: FOR TREASURY: \nTransactions Upon Passing:\nSend 10 $ORANGE \nFrom: 0xXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX (Treasury Gnosis Multisig)\nTo: 0xXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX ([Name1]’s wallet)\nSend 0.05 $ETH\nFrom: 0xXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX (Treasury Gnosis Multisig)\nTo: 0xXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX ([Name1]’s wallet)\n",

      "title": "OIP-57: Support Orange DAO members building full time in web3",
      "content": "Full proposal here:\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1bdeN26QTuqCmyBDVC9wEEaM3BNIFHKGZCFc_O6qa0WM/edit#\n\nGoal:\nTo support Orange DAO builders with an idea to explore and build full time for 3 months.\n\nSingle Point of Contact: (Only 1 individual for GovC to reach out with questions, and to represent at TownHall.)\n@jamessinka.eth or James Sinka #3533\n\nSponsors: Include folks planning to work on this proposal. Do not include folks who are just supportive of this proposal. \n@cryptpalsingh, @JPren, @RicardoG.eth\n\nDescription:\nJames Sinka has built a fellowship like this at On Deck [letter of recommendation here]. In this proposed Orange Fellowship fellowship, Orange DAO provides accountability, community, and personal runway of $25k for builders to build full time. What members build could become a startup, a public good, or open source project at the end of the batch. There will be a demo day at the end of the batch to share with the DAO what you’ve learned and built. We want to mirror this from startup school where applicants tell us what they think they're going to accomplish in the 3 months. We have them select a KPI they track, like commits pushed or users talked to, or milestones met.\n\nThis proposal funds 6 builders in Orange DAO to go full time. They receive 25k in USDC. Fellows will either be taking an advance for their startup, which will trigger a MFN conversation for their first round OR build something within Orange DAO and the $25k as a project \"contractor\" payment. Note no MFN is triggered unless a web3 startup/DAO is formed within 12 months of the end of the fellowship. There is no expectation of startup formation. We’re doing this for the future benefit of the Orange DAO community. This grant is tied to a member’s Orange GEM, thereby curbing bad acting & can lead to a ban if they run off with the $.\nJames Sinka will run this program in sync with Season1 and have the conclusion & demo day wrap with the end of Season 1. No $ORANGE is given out initially, but we will do a post hoc proposal to vote to give $ORANGE to those who the DAO believes deserve it. James Sinka will be reviewing applications and managing the pipeline.\n\nMethods: To ensure a successful program, the following methods are being put in place.\nMembers will meet weekly on a zoom call to share what they’ve learned, ask for support, make goals for next week, and accountability. This format mirrors the YC experience. Fellowship success KPI: 4 out of the 6 people are able to get to 80% of their goals.\n\n\nWe start by funding Orange DAO members (YC alumni) through a 5-minute application that will be reviewed within 72 hours. They must state their objectives and KPIs for the end of Season 1. Our first batch will consist of 6 Orange DAO members. \nOrange DAO members who are determined to go full time into web3 and need the runway to do so. Think of this as a scholarship program at Stanford. James Sinka will be managing the program, hosting office hours, etc - James will be responsible for getting fellows resources to maximize their success.\nProbably good for additional DAO members to participate as well (comment).\n\n\nFellows will meet weekly on zoom to discuss what they did last week, what they plan to do next week, and what their blockers are. This mirrors the YC experience we each had.\n\n\nThe Program Manager of the fellowship will start and own the discord channel for Orange Fellows to interact and support one another. This channel is open to any Orange DAO member to join, keep up with the fellowship, and support in any way they’d like to. This channel will house and document learnings of the fellowship as well, so future programs can learn from the experiences of past fellows.\n\n\nIf fellows start a company in web3 in the 12 months following the fellowship, the MFN triggers and converts to equity. However, if they don't, then they don't owe the DAO anything. Our request is for fellows to help the DAO capture and share the learnings they've had.\n\n\nThe subsequent generation of Orange Fellowship PM will be selected by Governance or an appropriate committee who will appoint said program manager on an ongoing basis. The Orange Fellowship PM will be the one setting the budget and in charge of filtering and choosing fellowship participants.\n\nBenefits:\nThis proposal supports talent to join full-time and build things for Orange DAO or a project that Orange DAO will own a stake in. This is the perfect timing for Orange DAO members who want to build full-time in web3.\n\nThis proposal aligns the DAO’s needs with these members looking to become core contributors, without the friction of having individual proposals for each role, nor requiring DAO members to self-select and carve out these roles for themselves.\n\n\n\nSuccess Metrics:\nFellowship success KPI: 4 out of the 6 people are able to get to 80% of their goals.\n\n\nSuccess Confidence: \n(If this proposal was executed 100 times, how many times will it meet its goal?)\n80%\nJames Sinka has built, run, and supported a fellowship like this at On Deck, full time, for the past year.\n\n\nKPIs after proposal: \nWe have a documented playbook and learnings for how to do Fellowships v2\nSuccess Confidence: \n95%\n\nDuration:\nStart: Season 1\nEnd: End of Season 1\n\nTokens Requested: (Treasury control) (Treasury Guidance)\n$ORANGE Total: $6K ORANGE - however, tokens are to be retroactively dropped, upon a vote, for projects that are deemed worthy, by the DAO, up to 1K ORANGE.\n$175k USDC ($25K USDC * (6 fellows + 1 admin)\n\nToken Distribution: (Sponsors’ control)\n30k $ORANGE for the Sponsor (James Sinka in this case)\n\nFAQ:\nWhat happens if 2 or more Orange Fellows join forces to co-found a company together?\nIf 2 or more Orange Fellows co-found a company in web3 within the SAFE conversion window, the amount that will convert to a SAFE would be equal to the total amount these fellows have received from the DAO\nExample 1: 2 fellows found a company together as co-founders within the SAFE conversion window, $50k will convert to the SAFE. \nExample 2: 2 fellows found a company together as co-founders and a 3rd fellow joins the company as an early employee, $50k will convert to the SAFE, the $25k from the 3rd fellow will not convert to a SAFE.\nWhat happens if I start a company that’s not related to web3 after the fellowship?\nYour grant will not automatically convert to a SAFE.\n\n\nCan I have some other job or role or startup while doing an Orange Fellowship?\nThe Orange Fellowship is a full-time program (40 hours a week). You are expected to work on this full-time and not commit to any other full-time employment during the 3-month program.\nCan Fellows work on more than 1 project for the DAO during the fellowship?\nYes, please include as much detail about your fellowship project(s) as possible in your application.\n\nRISKS: (Open to All Members)\nOrangeDAO Fellows run off with the money\nWe tied the $25k grant to the Orange GEM allowing us to track bad behavior\nNot enough demand\nThere could only be 5 people in the DAO who want to go full time in web3, meaning we can’t fill all the slots outlined\n\n\nCOUNTERPOINTS: (Open to All Members)\nIf someone abuses the system we can hold them accountable with their Orange GEM\nThere’s been a flurry of excitement, we just need to boost this opportunity via newsletter and Town Hall and the appliations will be flowing in\n\nADMIN: FOR TREASURY: \nTransactions Upon Passing:\nSend 10 $ORANGE \nFrom: 0xXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX (Treasury Gnosis Multisig)\nTo: 0xXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX ([Name1]’s wallet)\nSend 0.05 $ETH\nFrom: 0xXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX (Treasury Gnosis Multisig)\nTo: 0xXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX ([Name1]’s wallet)\n",

      "title": "OIP-52: Dedicated DAO Full Time Engineers",
      "content": "Full proposal here:\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1Q9MKAWKwwpXxf9BlVg3sQG3RysBeZBkaWyejR39wIYc/edit#heading=h.ddfcrao9n93f\n\nGoal:\nProvide a framework for the hiring and management of dedicated DAO engineers. Allocate a seasonal budget to fund paying them in USDC.\n\nSingle Point of Contact: (Only 1 individual for GovC to reach out with questions, and to represent at TownHall.)\nmrmemes.eth\n\nSponsors: Include folks planning to work on this proposal. Do not include folks who are just supportive of this proposal. \nmrmemes.eth, sayangel.eth\n\nDescription:\n\nPurpose:\n\nThe DAO currently has a number of projects that it would like to execute on, but are currently short-staffed for engineering help, in particular. Making full time engineering staff available to execute on any project approved by the DAO will open the path to executing on projects much more quickly than any other currently available avenue. Making clear how to apply and receive approval for access to engineers as well as what expectations are placed on those requesting engineering time will promote fair access and efficient use once granted.\n\nApplying:\n\nAny member can apply to receive engineering time to be used for projects intended to benefit the DAO at any time and for any reason. Projects receiving the sponsorship of a permanent committee will automatically be accepted. Projects that pass a proposal that involves a development component will be automatically accepted. Smaller projects or other projects falling outside of these cases can make their case directly to the Dev Committee for access to development resources. This should be initiated via Discord, in the Development Committee channel and by mentioning @DevC. Generally speaking, the Dev Committee will do its best to accommodate all valid requests and allow them to participate in the prioritization process.\n\nSponsorship:\n\nSponsorship of a project should be announced by a permanent committee member on behalf of their permanent committee via a discord message that mentions @DevC in the Development Committee channel. Sponsorship indicates agreement of that committee to make itself (or a representative from the committee) available to participate in prioritization sessions (see details below). Failure to attend prioritization forfeits their spot in prioritization for that session.\n\nPrioritization:\n\nPrioritization sessions will be held every two weeks and will last no more than 1 hour. These sessions will determine what’s worked on for the next two week period and should be completed at least 3 days in advance of the next period’s commencement. Participants in prioritization will make their case for the order of their project in the queue of upcoming projects and are expected to agree on the order amongst themselves. Participants should consider:\n\nDuration of time a project has spent in the queue\nOverall impact of the project for the DAO\nWork already in progress\n\nDev Committee members (or a representative member) will act as moderator and tie breaker in the event that participants are not able to come to an agreement.\n\nExpectations:\n\nFor projects and project stakeholders:\nProjects will designate a single PoC for planning purposes.\nProjects will prepare a detailed scope of work for prioritization, in advance of prioritization and will work with the development committee to ensure that their work is detailed and granular enough to be worked on -The scope of this work must always be less than two weeks and it is the responsibility of the project’s point person to reduce the scope of their tasks into something achievable in two weeks. Dev committee will give feedback on what is actually achievable in that period. \nProjects with a total scope that is larger than two weeks must still plan for breaking their project down into two week sessions at the end of which a deliverable is provided.\nDev committee is here to facilitate scoping, not to execute it or manage it.\n\nFor Engineers\nAvailable for 40 hours per week of work, with flexibility to pull some overtime during periods of crunch time (should be rare and always discussed in advance)\n\nManagement and Oversight:\n\nBroadly speaking, the Dev Committee will attempt to act in a facilitative manner with regard to projects and will encourage direct communication between engineers and project stakeholders. Dev Committee reserves the right to intervene in a project at any point in order to address concerns brought to it by the engineers or project stakeholders. Intervention should most often be in the form of a conversation that helps get things back on track, but in extreme cases could be used to deprioritize a project until some issue has been addressed. The onus is firmly on the project stakeholders to ensure that work is clearly detailed and that engineers are not blocked from moving forward while waiting on responses or interaction with stakeholders.\n\nThe Dev Committee will schedule regular 1:1s with engineers and use this feedback to refine the processes outlined here for the betterment of the DAO and for improvement of the experience of the engineers. Reviews will happen quarterly or as needed and should give substantive feedback on performance for the engineers.\n\nThe Dev Committee has sole discretion as to how it goes about the hiring process and who it chooses to hire. It should, however, feel encouraged to take into account any opinions and recommendations offered by other DAO members and generally avail itself of the DAOs network of experts wherever it makes sense. The Dev Committee also reserves the right to initiate termination proceedings at any point if it is determined that the engineers in the employ of the DAO are acting in poor faith or otherwise cannot or will not fulfill their duty. Any DAO member may also petition for the termination of any engineer and all such petitions will be taken with extreme gravity.\n\nCandidate Qualifications:\n\nA full Job Description will be issued during the hiring phase, but the spirit of the document should be:\n\n\nTo hire excellent engineers\nWho are experienced with Web3 technologies\nWho want more autonomy\nAre interested in learning more about entrepreneurship\nHave excellent communication skills\nAre very organized\nAre excellent at self-directed work\nHave experience working remotely\n\nBenefits:\nThis formalizes and makes clear how the development committee will go about hiring for and managing access to dedicated engineering staff. It also makes clear some of the workaday details of managing engineering staff, like reviews, 1-on-1s, allocation/prioritization and in the event of its necessity, termination. The biggest single benefit though, will be having a way to drive forward development efforts for the DAO.\n\n(Link to Proposal Details if applicable)\n\nSuccess Metrics:\nEngineering staff is hired and made available to the DAO for work on projects\nProject stakeholders have fair access to the application and prioritization process\nEngineering staff always has work teed up in advance\nPrioritized projects are executed on consistently\n\nDuration:\nStart: Season 1, as soon as hiring is possible\nEnd: No end date, this is an ongoing function\n\nTokens Requested: (Treasury control) (Treasury Guidance)\n$USDC Total: 200,000/season (paid biweekly or bimonthly, like a regular paycheck)\n100,000 per engineer x 2 engineers\n\nToken Distribution: (Sponsors’ control)\n$ORANGE Total: 12,000/season directly to the Development Committee, to be distributed amongst themselves as they see fit (preferring even split, but allowing for parties that don’t have inclination or time to participate to bow out).\n$ETH total: 1/season to fund smart contract deployments and other development-related ETH costs\n\n\nRISKS: (Open to All Members)\nBy mrmemes.eth:\n\n\n\nCOUNTERPOINTS: (Open to All Members)\nBy mrmemes.eth:\n\n\n\nADMIN: FOR TREASURY: \nTransactions Upon Passing:\nSend 10 $ORANGE \nFrom: 0xXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX (Treasury Gnosis Multisig)\nTo: 0xXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX ([Name1]’s wallet)\nSend 0.05 $ETH\nFrom: 0xXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX (Treasury Gnosis Multisig)\nTo: 0xXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX ([Name1]’s wallet)\n",

      "content": "Full proposal here:\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1-2p1A_ME-_W2GPJKNrU8WQ7PYUqYjarukMsI6Fj2j9k/edit#\n\nPassport By Contributor Compensation\n\nTL;DR\nPassport By Orange(PBO) is a potential Orange Public Good to support membership NFTs. This proposal is to get 3 month funding for the project to pay USDC upfront to a committed part-time team, and reward with $ORANGE for achieving timeline(speed) & customer milestones. \n\nSingle Point of Contact: @cryptpal\nTokens Requested(Summary): $120K USDC, $300K ORANGE\nDuration: Season 1 (3 Months starting 5/30)\n \n\nDescription\nPassport by Orange is a project that draws on our insight that NFTs can provide membership utility (similar to the GEM). You can learn more here, and check out the team’s progress on discord.\n\nTaking learnings from previous projects and builder feedback, we are doing a few things differently - \n\nStarting with strong PM ownership: \nArian for Product and Talking to Users; Ned+Nic for technical PM(example); JP+Cryptpal to unblock, address dao admin stuff(like this proposal), work on budget, partnerships etc. \nClear contributor participation & ownership:\nContributors commit 15-20 hours/week and get paid base USDC (in line with Compensation 1.0) \nThis is a different experiment from DAO’s previous approach of relying on member downtime.\nTeam has 1 backend, 1 contract, and 1 frontend engineer, and 1 designer with a buffer for 2 more engineers.\nRewarding Speed:\nWhile folks get baseline in USDC, there are team rewards for hitting aggressive milestones. This is a step in the direction of learning what levers we have to build fast within the DAO. \nReward KPI goals aggressively: \nWithout customer adoption, the DAOs ideas will not go really far. We want to experiment with aggressive customer acquisition rewards. There is a bounty for onboarding each customer (community manager) that is split with the whole team. \nFocusing on Succeeding/ Failing Fast: \nThe DAO shouldn’t be a graveyard of half complete project. The team is dedicated to either making something of this project that’s valuable to the ecosystem or recognizing it’s not the right project, pivoting based on feedback and killing it if there isn’t PMF.\nAll the factors above are designed to help with this. The team is resourced for 3-mo, at the end of which, a new proposal with learnings/KPIs would be shared to determine if the project is complete as is(open to the world to use), deserves continued investment or is explicitly sunsetted.\n\n\nBenefits\nPBO is designed for community memberships from the ground up (vs trading) and has potential of accelerating web3 adoption drastically by giving simple yet powerful tools to community owners. We know this, because we are our first users (for LP NFTs, and PortCo NFTs). \n\nThe project is well-scoped, and mid-sized - a great way to start building our muscle of launching public goods. And, If successful, it will further solidify our position in web3 as leaders and driver of innovation, leading to -\n\nAwareness that Orange is home for builders.\nAttracting top founders for Orange Fund, and hackers to the Dao.\nHigh exposure to effort ratio - expected to be used by a LOT of communities.\nDemonstration of another great way of L1/L2 partnerships and showcases the asymmetric value YC founders can create for chains - creating a compelling reason for them to work with us.\n\nSponsors\nEngineers: @bowtiesarekoo, @rashid, @enx, \nTechnical PM: @nicsal & @0xNed (Acting as 1)\nProduct PM: @arian\nDesign: @thickshake/@jpren (Acting as 1)\nContract Advising/Dev Committee Support: @sayangel\nAdmin: @cryptpal \n\nYou can read more about the role descriptions here.\nCompensation, Tokens Requested & Milestones\n\nUSDC Compensation\nContributor\nCompensation(USDC)\nBow Ties Are Koo*\n$15,000\nRashid*\n$15,000\nenx*\n$15,000\nThickshake*\n$7,500\nJP*\n$7,500\n0xNed & Nicolas\n$15,000\nArian*\n$15,000\ncryptpal\n$0\nBuffer\n$30,000\nTotals:\n$120,000\n\n\nToken Compensation (Not tied to Rewards)= Teams discretion on how to split\nContributor\nCompensation ($ORANGE)\nSayAngel (Contracts Advisor)\n3K\nLebek (Royalty)\n5K\n0xNed & Nicolas\n(Technical Advisors)\n5K\nMVP Pool\n35K\nTotals:\n50K\n\n\n\nKPIs & Rewards (Subject to change)\nEach milestone unlocks a certain $ORANGE evenly distributed between active contributors (marked with asterix above)\nStarting Date: 5/23\nMilestone\nTime Frame\nSuggested Reward* ($ORANGE)\nShip LP NFTs\n3 Weeks\n25K \nManually onboard & ship membership NFT for first external customer\n5 Weeks\n25K \nShip self-serve MVP (Polished) \n8 Weeks\n100K \nOnboard 1 customer x 10\n3 months\n100K (10K/customer)\nTotals:\n\n\n250K\n\nRisks & Counterpoints\n\nRISKS\n(By All Members)\n\n\nCOUNTERPOINTS\n(By All Members)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nADMIN: FOR TREASURY: \nTransactions Upon Passing:\nSend 10 $ORANGE \nFrom: 0xXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX (Treasury Gnosis Multisig)\nTo: 0xXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX ([Name1]’s wallet)\nSend 0.05 $ETH\nFrom: 0xXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX (Treasury Gnosis Multisig)\nTo: 0xXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX ([Name1]’s wallet)\n",

(The Orange DAO Foundation is our Cayman Islands entity, acting as a wrapper to Orange DAO.)\n\nWe’d like to establish some continuity here and are looking for someone able to make a 2-year commitment, divided into four 6-month seasons.\n\nThe workload is expected to be light. Mainly taking committee and proposal outputs, running it by our Director of the Cayman entity (Eduardo), possibly interfacing with the legal team to review in the US and/or Cayman, and finally having the Board of the Orange DAO Foundation pass the proposal. Prior experience working with a board, legal team, and offshore entities may be helpful.\n\nThe role will report to the Governance Committee and work closely with the Treasury team. The Governance committee explored and agreed on a set of qualifications for an ideal candidate for the role of Orange DAO Foundation Liaison, carried out interviews, and on May 24th 2022 selected James Green to carry out this role. Subsequent appointments into this position will also be handled by Governance.\n\n\nThe Gov Comm proposes a bounty of 15k ORANGE per season (a total of 60k for the full 2 year term).\n\nNext steps if this proposal is executed:\nGov Comm will officially appoint James Green to this role (no voting)\n\n\nBenefits:\nCreating a dedicated role for interfacing with the Orange DAO Foundation ensures that the job is given the attention it deserves and is executed in a timely manner. Furthermore, it ensures that we have a member with relevant experience/knowledge performing the job.\n\nHaving a dedicated role for this might also decrease our spending on legal entities in Cayman/US.\n\nSuccess Metrics:\nKPIs before proposal: \nSemi-permanent members acting as interface to Orange DAO Foundation: 0\nKPIs after proposal:\nSemi-permanent members acting as interface to Orange DAO Foundation: 1\nSuccess Confidence:\n90%\n\nDuration:\nStart: Season 1\nEnd: End of Season 4 (2 year term)\n\nTokens Requested: (Treasury control) (Treasury Guidance)\n$ORANGE Total: 60k\nFor Interfacing Member (member acting as interface to Orange DAO Foundation): 60k\n\nToken Distribution: (Sponsors’ control)\n$ORANGE\nInterfacing Member, season 1: 15k\nInterfacing Member, season 2: 15k\nInterfacing Member, season 3: 15k\nInterfacing Member, season 4: 15k\n\nRISKS: (Open to All Members)\nBy [Member1]\n[risk]\n\nCOUNTERPOINTS: (Open to All Members)\nBy [Member4]\n[counterpoint]\n\nADMIN: FOR TREASURY: \nTransactions Upon Passing:\nSend 10 $ORANGE \nFrom: 0xXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX (Treasury Gnosis Multisig)\nTo: 0xXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX ([Name1]’s wallet)\nSend 0.05 $ETH\nFrom: 0xXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX (Treasury Gnosis Multisig)\nTo: 0xXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX ([Name1]’s wallet)\n",

Each one of these roles will be compensated with 30,000 $ORANGE for Season 1 (for a total of 180,000 $ORANGE for Season 1). Compensation for each role can be prorated by days that the individual serves during the season, as needed. For example, if an individual selected for one of these roles begins halfway through Season 1, they will receive half (15,000) of the specified $ORANGE for Season 1. \nThe Governance Committee (GCom) will set the number of people per subcommittee and select the final candidates. GCom will make an open call for members to apply for these positions.\n\nInternal Communications Subcommittee #1: Facilitate and streamline internal communications for the DAO.\nInternal Communications Role: we currently have an Internal Communications role that is not part of a sub-committee. This proposal also serves to make this role part of the Internal Communications subcommittee. @Cryptpal is the first full-time working member of the DAO, his Internal Communications role and compensation was addressed in the OIP-22 proposal. His role is separate from the 6 roles addressed by this proposal. \n\nThe following are some of the primary functions of the Internal Comms sub-committee: \nFacilitate DAO communication\nTown Halls\nCommunicate Orange DAO vision and direction to all members\nImprove organization in our Discord server\nOrganize channels including archiving those no longer used\nMeasure the effectiveness of DAO communication\nGenerate and send newsletters on a consistent basis\nIncrease the base of newsletter subscriptions\nMeasure total reach and engagement rates across all channels\nTown Halls\nNewsletter\nDiscord\nEvents\nSet OKRs\n\nOnboarding Subcommittee #2: Facilitate and streamline the onboarding process for new members. \nMake people feel welcome\nDefine “onboarded.” \nMeasure the number of people and conversion rates in the onboarding funnel.\nHelp members become productive in the DAO\nImprove core knowledge of DAO members after joining\nIdentify the key information needed by new members\nSet OKRs\nSuccess: Establish Onboarding Funnel metrics, something like (but not necessarily):\nWho is receiving communications (Discord, Email, etc.)\nUnderstand who is new to web3, new to Discord, and measure those conversions separately\nWho has minted their GEM?\nWho has received $ORANGE tokens?\nWho has voted on proposals?\nWho is active in Discord?\nWhat causes people to engage or churn?\n\nInclusion Subcommittee #3: Build the DAO’s internal inclusivity and diversity initiatives\nSet OKRs\nSuccess: Diverse representation and inclusion\nMake people feel welcome\nEngage, invite and recruit current YC alumni who are members of underrepresented groups.\nX alumni outreached\nPropose and track inclusion metrics Provide extra onboarding support to underrepresented members \nProvide resources for training on\nInclusivity and impact \nEducation to participate in the DAO\n\nProposal Quality & Process Subcommittee #4: Facilitate and enhance the quality of proposals. Guide and support Orange DAO members drafting and submitting proposals.\nRefine processes for proposal creation, review and voting to minimize fatigue and maximize productivity \nRead all proposal drafts, offer feedback and be an active participant in proposal discussions\nCollect proposal process feedback and draft guidance to drive clarity and improve outcomes\n\nBenefits:\nThis proposal to create subcommittees for key functions originates from the critical learnings gathered from Season 0 and from the IRL Retreat in Cabo re: helping the DAO scale.\n\nWe have several DAO contributors who want to become core contributors, but we do not have roles for them. This proposal aligns the DAO’s needs with these members looking to become core contributors, without the friction of having individual proposals for each role, nor requiring DAO members to self-select and carve out these roles for themselves.\n\nSuccess Metrics:\nCurrent State of KPIs: \nInternal Comms:\nMeasure total reach and engagement rates across all channels (Town Halls, Newsletter, Discord, Events) \nQualitative surveying\nOnboarding:\nOnboarding Funnel metrics: 0\nNo new member onboarding funnel\nInclusion\nProposals:\nDocument on proposal standard: 1 (template)\nScoring of proposals based on quality: 0\nKPIs after success:\nInternal Comms:\nReach and engagement rates: Baseline established\nOnboarding:\nOnboarding Funnel metrics: Baseline established\nNew member onboarding is tracked in a funnel for 100% of new members\nInclusion\nProposals:\nDocument on proposal standards for three types of proposals: token allocation, charter amendment, DAO commitments\nScoring of new proposals based on quality: 100%\nSuccess Confidence: \n(If this proposal was executed 100 times, how many times will it meet its goal?)\n80%\n\nDuration:\nStart: Season 1\nEnd: End of Season 1\n\nTokens Requested: (Treasury control)\n$ORANGE Total: 180,000\nFor Team Leads: 0\nFor Proposal Goal: 180,000\n\nToken Distribution: (Sponsors’ control)\n$ORANGE\nTBD once the final candidates per role have been selected as well as their start dates\n\nRISKS: (Open to All Members)\nBy @huh.eth\nThe KPIs will need more flexibility than prescribed in this OIP to let the subcommittees accomplish the intended goals of this proposal.\nWe may need more people or tokens to accomplish the goals.\n\nCOUNTERPOINTS: (Open to All Members)\n\n\nADMIN: FOR TREASURY: \nTransactions Upon Passing:\nNo action until end of Season 1.\n",

Do not include folks who are just supportive of this proposal. \nhuh.eth, RicardoG\n\nDescription:\nQuadratic voting is a mathematical way to improve voting outcomes to be more democratic when one person can hold more than one vote. It weighs the amount of people voting for an issue more than just the token amounts. \n\nELI5: Your voting power is roughly the square root of your token holdings. 1 token = 1 vote, 16 tokens = 4 votes, n tokens = √n votes.\n\nSee more information here (https://wtfisqf.com/). This is natively supported by Snapshot (https://docs.snapshot.org/proposals/voting-types). Vitalik of Ethereum has a lengthier write up as well about quadratic payments and voting (https://vitalik.ca/general/2019/12/07/quadratic.html). Additionally, this is not just a crypto concept and has been explored in the academic world as well. One example is Quadratic Voting: How Mechanism Design Can Radicalize Democracy (https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2003531). \n\nBenefits\nIt is critical for OrangeDAO to be community owned and operated. The reason OrangeDAO should adopt quadratic voting by default is so that we do not centralize power to any large $ORANGE holders. It is best to do this early before any potential issues so that we can protect the integrity of our voting process long term.\n\nSuccess Metrics:\nN/A\n\nDuration:\nStart: All new proposals after this one passes\nEnd: Never (unless another proposal votes to changing the default voting method)\n\nTokens Requested: (Treasury control) (Treasury Guidance)\nN/A\n\nRISKS: (Open to All Members)\n\nCOUNTERPOINTS: (Open to All Members)\n\nADMIN: FOR TREASURY: \nTransactions Upon Passing:\nSend 10 $ORANGE \nFrom: 0xXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX (Treasury Gnosis Multisig)\nTo: 0xXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX ([Name1]’s wallet)\nSend 0.05 $ETH\nFrom: 0xXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX (Treasury Gnosis Multisig)\nTo: 0xXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX ([Name1]’s wallet)\n",

Do not include folks who are just supportive of this proposal. \n@chingularity#8979\n\nDescription:\nThe first website, the Orange DAO twitter account and ‘Request for startup’ project were instrumental for the early growth of Orange DAO.  This is a proposal to request compensation in the form of $Orange for these projects and the impact that they had.\n\nBenefits:\nWebsite - Johnny built the first version of the website on Notion that served as the main site for Orange DAO until very recently.  Anecdotally, many DAO members have reported that people externally have said that they’ve read the entire website.  (Note: DAO members have been updating the website more recently). \n\nTwitter - The twitter account is a significant channel of deal flow to Orange Fund.  We are currently seeing 150 startups per month.  It has over 6,100 followers including many of the biggest people in crypto (from Paradigm partners to Electric Capital partners). \n\nRequest for Startup - Johnny created a discord channel and encouraged DAO members to share ideas for future startups they wanted to have created.  He took all submissions and added them to a public facing website within 24 hours.  This project served as early external marketing for Orange DAO and Orange Fund.  It has led to at least 3 startups funded by our fund. \n\n(Link to Proposal Details if applicable)\n\nSuccess Metrics:\nKPIs before proposal: \nTwitter: Over 6,100 twitter followers.  Significant channel for 150 inbound startup deals per month to Orange Fund. \n‘Request for startup’ project: has led to at least 3 startups funded for Orange Fund. \nWebsite: Primary website for 1,200 DAO members and 60+ portfolio companies. \nKPIs after proposal: N/A\nSuccess Confidence: N/A\nDuration:\nStart: During Orange DAO’s inception.\nEnd: End of Season 0\n\nTokens Requested: (Treasury control) (Treasury Guidance)\n$ORANGE Total: 55,000\nFor first website and Notion costs reimbursement\nFor ‘Request for startup’\nFor growing and running the Orange DAO twitter account from beginning to end of Season 0\n\nToken Distribution: (Sponsors’ control)\n$ORANGE\nJohnny: 55,000\n\nRISKS: (Open to All Members)\nBy [Member1]\n\nCOUNTERPOINTS: (Open to All Members)\nBy [Member4]\n\nADMIN: FOR TREASURY: \nTransactions Upon Passing:\nSend 55,000 $ORANGE \nFrom: 0xXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX (Treasury Gnosis Multisig)\nTo: 0x92cD4bD69E305634a72fc95992ECFa0699C784e7 (Johnny’s wallet)\n",

      "content": "## akshatg.eth\nNewer here than the others, so if time here is the major factor, vote no. However, in my short time, I have led engagement projects (1:1 chat roulette, EU community), helped dealflow analytics, am now reviewing/speaking with deals, and helping portcos. I have been on the founding team of a very successful $100M+ early-stage fund and want to leverage the learnings/network, especially around deal evaluation distribution & portco support automation to make our DAO bigger than the sum of its parts. \n\n## RicardoG.eth\nAs part of the S-0 Gov team, I had the amazing opportunity to contribute to building the DAO’s foundation. I look forward to continuing to establish our vision & working together to create an exemplary DAO, w/ product, community & diversity at its core. I’d appreciate your vote for S1!\nI’m proud to have:\n- Designed/hosted our Town Halls\n- Improved proposal/voting process\n- Advised/championed future leaders\n- Planned/hosted chats w/ web3 leaders (Ian @Syndicate 50+ attendees)\n- Assisted in planning our IRL retreat\n- Developed software (Juicy Assistant) to enrich our community \n\n## oparrott.eth\n- 10-year full-time commitment to Orange Fund. On track to raise a $50M fund that brings 100% of carry into the DAO treasury. Established the legal framework and leading operations. Kicked off Dealflow team.\n- Joining S1 Gov Team to prepare Orange DAO for growth from new YC batches.\n- Served on S0 Treasury. We rocked it. Setup multisig and initial token distribution systems including vesting and airdrops. \n- Co-created S0 Token Guidance, Operating Manual. Led OIP-10 so new members get $ORANGE.\n\n## Krel.eth\n- Currently serving as Design Lead for ODAO. During season 0, I’ve shipped designs for mascot, LFG game, & website. \n- My dayjob is building NewShadesDAO (\"discord for DAOs\"), I'm intrigued by how DAOs can evolve day-to-day activities, improve communication, and mature as Orgs. One recent conviction is the need for \"optimistic governance\", to avoid voting fatigue, etc. \n- My main goal would be to develop governance methods to improve KPIs such as voter participation and make it easier to contribute.\n\n## arangel.eth (rangel#9823) \nWould be honored to have your vote for S1 Gov Team.\n- Recently sold the business I took to YC S14, and since then have been contributing to OrangeDAO.  \n- Helping lead the outreach team which is actively working with our first Layer 1 partner.  Which includes rolling out a variety of mutually beneficial offerings and tools.\n- I view onboarding as a critical piece that should be improved in S1.  This will enable us to build a growing community of highly engaged orange alum. A few ideas are: \n  - creating a simple onboarding checklist \n  - creating a first 1-4-12 week onboarding timeline \n  - an $orange mentor/buddy program to increase excitement/engagement from new members.  \n\n\n",

      "content": "## huh.eth\nI am currently serving on the Governance Committee and a GP of Orange Fund. I would like to continue to learn about the operations of Orange DAO and contribute to the work of the Treasury Committee to provide responsible guidance and getting tokens out to our community so that Orange DAO is a sustainable and equitable organization for all members.\n\n## Maqq\nI’m currently on Treasury and want to continue on for Season 1. My heart is in this 🧡. I led the Treasury on many cold start problems, incl. trxns of 3.7M $ORANGE to 230+ members, OIP-1, 2, 18, 29 and Fund 0 LP distro. Passionate about improving systems to pay contributors faster (currently leading Fast Track Comp. test), more equitably and transparency. Excited for new problems like treasury diversification, improving consistency and speed of compensation. Let’s keep it juicy Orange DAO!\n\n## ayan\n👋 I'm Ayan. Elected to the founding Treasury Committee and proud to have built a strong & secure foundation for our token. Super excited to tackle our next challenges and have more DAO members holding, earning, and building through $ORANGE 🍊 \nSome highlights:\n- Established multi-sig & security practices to keep our tokens safe\nDistributed $ORANGE to members, builders, and our first full-time employee (!)\n- Led grants team to give equity-free funding to YC founders\n- Defined treasury software stack, supporting portcos\n- Huge thanks to Orion & Mack for being incredible partners this season.\n\n## iamdonho\nI would like to apply my expertise to the Treasury Committee in order to make it the most robust DAO in the world and a leader in treasury management. Most immediately, we need an annual BUDGET! Kickstarted Treasury Committee, currently lead all revenue generating activities for Orange, closed $30M in L1 sponsorships, closing $50M Orange Fund for DAO, multisig signer for Fund and DAO. \n\n## Pineapple (Jamie)\nI’m a bit newer to the DAO than others applying here, but I am excited to contribute further and get more deeply involved. My contribution so far has primarily involved working with the Portco Support Team. Relevant to this role, I set up the compensation accounting system for providing Portco support and the multisig to deliver $ORANGE in line with OIP-18 [as detailed here]. I am interested in supporting increased transparency of the DAO treasury through improving documentation and reporting.\n\n## simonft\nI started contributing only for one month, where I’ve been supporting Orange Fund (and will continue to do so) by selling and creating deal flow. I am interested to continue to support the DAO in different ways. In my last company Valiu I had to deal with a lot of treasury risk management (between fiat and crypto), so hopefully that experience can be used by this team.\n",

I want to continue to support Orange DAO devs to create amazing products (lfg, gem, website.)\n\n## byron#4552\nByron recently launched Grove, \"Bookcase for Orange\".  That started as Portfolio Company Support, but expanded scope when greater needs became apparent.  Through that, Byron helped manage data and process in member onboarding, Fund dealflow, member profiles, demographics, office hours, etc.  Byron is a rusty dev and would contribute primarily via technical strategy, data structure, resource management, coordinating talent, and low-code.  Byron is seeking to learn Web3 development while helping guide Orange into an agile and exciting future\n\n## mrmemes.eth#6174\nI was instrumental in building out the contracts and front end integration to the contracts for LFG. I’m a lifelong and active builder who can still step back and see the big picture. I’m also very invested in the DAO and want to continue to help it succeed. I’d love to focus on mentoring at the DAO and helping other BUIDLers get involved through direct engagement in projects.\n\n## enx#8760\nI am running to support those in the DAO who like building and exploring. Especially for those seeking a startup, there is no better way to find cofounders or team members than to do a project together. Some things I would do: set a buidl call, facilitate hackathon teams, seek grant money, help test / try / evaluate. I like to instigate and prototype and believe my combination of skills, experiences, and inclinations combine to make me uniquely suited for that. More at https://twitter.com/enxeth\n\n## sayangel#7796\nOne of the core members of the YC gem dev team. I'm the artist behind the gem's ASCII orange. I've helped DAO builders onboard to web3 development. I've been thinking a lot about how the DAO can engage more builders. I want to help us recruit talent and engage the best web3 minds to take our in-house building to the next level. Brutal honesty: there are better places to meet web3 hackers than Orange DAO right now. Let's change that.\n",

      "title": "OIP-42: Cayman Foundation and 8M tokens for Season 1",
      "content": "Google Doc of proposal is located here:\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1oSbFYqjX27La_fLdNiYGsvDk2hame18I4gZRzdU2w70/edit#heading=h.43xajztr0tkh\n\nGoal:\nThis proposal creates a Cayman Islands foundation under the control of the DAO’s tokenholders and funds 2 roles to serve on the foundation at a total cost of approximately $30,000 USD annually. The DAO will hire external parties to serve these roles for legal and tax efficiency.\nChanges the Charter budget for Season 1 to 8 million $ORANGE.\n\nSingle Point of Contact: (Only 1 individual for GovC to reach out with questions, and to represent at TownHall.)\nhuh.eth\n\nSponsors: Include folks planning to work on this proposal. Do not include folks who are just supportive of this proposal. \nOparrott.eth, iamdonho\n\nDescription:\nThere are two separate and distinct actions being proposed in this OIP.\nCayman Foundation: Create a Cayman Island based foundation with 1 Board of Director, 1 Supervisor, and 1 Secretary as required by the Cayman Islands foundation laws. This role requires that people serving these roles be KYC’d under the Cayman legal framework and will serve for a minimum of 1 year term. The Board and Supervisor roles allow the tokenholder’s votes and wishes to be applied to the actions of the Foundation. The Foundation will also purchase liability insurance for both members if needed (this will increase costs beyond the listed $30,000). These two members will be selected after the passing of this proposal by the Governance Committee based on legal and tax considerations. The $30,000 includes the costs of creating and maintaining the foundation entity annually.\nReduce the amount of tokens allocated to Season 1 to 8 million $ORANGE: Passing OIP-42 will amend the charter to change this token allocation. The change in allocation has been approved by the Treasury Committee.  \n\nBenefits:\nCayman Foundation roles: In order to have a legal DAO entity, my research showed that the Cayman Islands foundation format (an owner-less legal entity) is a good fit for our needs, and would allow us to enter into contracts and agreements with partner organizations (like L1s). However, the law requires that at least 2 people serve at the Foundation level. Ideally, it should be staffed with experienced DAO members living outside the US, but can be staffed by professionals who live on the Caymans (this depends on the tax and compliance benefits to the DAO). The purpose of these roles is to make sure the Foundation is performing according to the will of its members.\nReduce the amount of tokens allocated to Season 1 to 8 million $ORANGE: Seasons 0 has shown that we expect to be more token-efficient than originally projected, and therefore reduces the number of tokens allocated to Season 1.\n\n\nSuccess Metrics:\nKPIs before proposal: \nDAO Foundation entity: 0\nGovernance token budget for Season 1: 15 million\nKPIs after proposal:\nDAO Foundation entity: 1\nGovernance token budget for Season 1: 8 million\nSuccess Confidence: \n(If this proposal was executed 100 times, how many times will it meet its goal?)\n100%\n\nDuration:\nStart: Season 1\nEnd: Cayman Foundation roles: Until the Foundation is dissolved.\nEnd: Reduce the amount of tokens allocated to Season 1 to 8 million $ORANGE: End of Season 1\n\nTokens Requested: (Treasury control) (Treasury Guidance)\n$ORANGE Total: 8 million\nFor Team Leads: 0\nFor Proposal Goal: 8 million\n$USDC Total: Approximately 30,000 annually\nFor Cayman professional services company: 30,000\n\n\nRISKS: (Open to All Members)\n\nCOUNTERPOINTS: (Open to All Members)\n\n",

The pilot would test the event’s concept with a real audience and deliver a recommendation on if/how to proceed with future events.\n\nPULP (working name, stands for \"Present Ur Latest Project\") is a recurring event to showcase the builders in our community, including projects and companies by Orange DAO members and Orange Fund PortCos.\n\nPilot events will be hosted by Emmie Chang and Nohtal.\n\nPart 1 (30 min): Feature ~6 of projects/companies per event who want to have something to show/demo (think: pre-Product Hunt). Eventually, this could become a show that is like “Live Product Hunt” \nPart 2 (30-90 min): After demos each project/company will become the leader of a breakout group. Participants can hop among different project/companies to have discussion with the founders.\n\nAudience: For the first two pilots the audience will be largely Orange DAO members and those who hear about it organically on the Stonks platform.\n\nTools:\nPart 1 will use Stonks, a platform building “YC Demo Day for everyone”.\nPart 2 uses Hoo (Founded by Orange DAO's very own Emmie Chang ⚡️)\nBroadcasters will use a version of Streamlabs OBS and VMixcall type tools\nHere’s our Orange DAO metaverse environment \nhttps://www.cryptovoxels.com/play?coords=E@717W,303N\n\n\n\nPULP 001: Early Stage Projects - proposed dates 3/15/22 and 4/12/22\nPresenters: any builder in Orange DAO that is pre-funding can give a demo on a new product they're working on and looking for feedback and/or investment.\nAudience: Stonks internal audience, Orange DAO, Friends of Orange DAO\nSelection criteria for presenters: pre-funding, looking primarily for feedback, secondarily for investment\n\nPULP 002: Orange Fund Showcase - proposed dates 3/29/22 and 4/26/22\nPresenters: 5-6 Orange Fund portfolio companies each give ~5 min demo\nAudience: Stonks internal audience, Orange DAO,  Orange Fund LP’s, Friends of Orange DAO\nSelection criteria for presenters: primarily those looking for funding, secondarily looking for feedback\n\nRoadmap, KPIs and awards\n\nBenefits:\nBuild a following for Orange DAO + Orange Fund for future LP’s, and “Friends of Orange Dao” to bring more awareness and more funds. This is a twice/month ‘casual meetup’ for those curious in what we’re doing. This also has the potential to grow to a Product Hunt Live style “Shark Tank” show that could draw a huge audience over time.\n\n(Link to Proposal Details if applicable)\n\nSuccess Metrics:\n\n\n\n\nGoal\nDeadline\n$ORANGE\n\n\n1\nSuccessfully run Pilot 001 2 times\nSuccess = \nAt least 5 companies pitching and saying it provided value for them. \nAt least 100 attendees for each event \nA company founder successfully demos and stays the hour to network \nWithin 1 month after passage of proposal\n\n\n5000 \n\n\n2\nSuccessfully run Pilot 2 2 times\nSame success metrics as above\nAt least 1 investor from the Stonks network invests at least $1000 \nA company founder successfully demos and reaches their goal \nWithin 1 month after Pilot 1\n5000 \n\n\n3\nSponsors to deliver retrospective on the two events and if/how they think the events fit into DAO’s goals moving forward.\n2 weeks after Pilot 2\n2000\n\n\n\n\nSomething else to measure would be the number of people who minted Orange Dao Gems post show versus pre-show and how impactful these shows have for people to mint th Orange Dao as YC. IF this becomes significant after these pilots, we’ll put them in place as a way to engage the audience and community more.\n\nDuration:\nStart: Season 0 , goal is March 15 and 29th and then April 12 and 26th\nEnd: < 10 weeks after passage\n\nTokens Requested: (Treasury control)\n$ORANGE Total: 12000\nFor Team Leads according to KPIs: 12000\n\nToken Distribution: (Sponsors’ control)\n$ORANGE\n[Emmie Chang]: 6000\n[Nohtal Partansky]: 6000\n\n\nRISKS: (Open to All Members) - examples\nBy [Member1]\n\n\nBy [Member2]\n\n\nBy [Member3]\n\n\n\nCOUNTERPOINTS: (Open to All Members) - examples\nBy [Member4]\nBy [Member5]\n\nADMIN: FOR TREASURY: \nTransactions Upon Passing:\nSend 10 $ORANGE \nFrom: 0xXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX (Treasury Gnosis Multisig)\nTo: 0xXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX ([Name1]’s wallet)\nSend 0.05 $ETH\nFrom: 0xXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX (Treasury Gnosis Multisig)\nTo: 0xXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX ([Name1]’s wallet)\n",

These bets are made with the $LFG token - 100 of which can be claimed by any YC gem holder each season. Once a startup has verified they have been accepted to YC, this bet is considered successful\n\nBenefits:\nLFG will not only build engagement within the DAO and provide signal to Orange Fund, but it will also serve as a platform OrangeDAO can spin off to other DAOs as we build out Orange Pro\n\nSuccess Metrics:\nKPIs before proposal: \nLFG contributors not rewarded for efforts\nLFG MVP live\nNo KPI pools set up for LFG\nKPIs after proposal:\nLFG contributors rewarded for efforts\nKPI pools set up for future improvement to LFG\nSuccess Confidence: \n(If this proposal was executed 100 times, how many times will it meet its goal?)\n90%\n\nDuration:\nStart: Season 0\nEnd: Season 3 (at which point KPI pools should be updated)\n\nTeam\nOn Core vs. Contributor vs. Reviewer: split is 70/25/5 of total reward for the category, then evenly split among members \n\nStage\nCore\nContributor/Reviewer\nSplit\nDeliverables\nInitial Ideation\n\n\nchingularity, huh.eth, iamdonho, oparrott.eth\nEliam.eth, jomessi, krel.eth, voska\n1/10\n10/14/21 Call Notes\n10/21/21 Call Notes\n10/31/21 Call Notes\nProduct Spec & Design\nvoska, chingularity, krel.eth\nAx, Abhilash Inumella#0203, huh.eth, cryptpalsingh\n4/10\nProduct Spec\nTech Spec\nDesign\nFront-end Development\nchums.sol\nCoop, hittingkeys, edward, mrmemes.eth\n2/10\nSite\nGithub\nBack-end Development\nmrmemes.eth\nLebek, sayangel\n2/10\nLFGToken Contract\nLFGGame Contract\nLFGStartup Contract\nLFGRecommendation Contract\nGithub\nProject Management\nChingularity, voska\n\n\n1/10\nDiscord\nProposal\nchums.sol, voska \n\n\n1,000 $ORANGE (500 ea)\nProposal\n\n\n\nAdditional improvements / KPIs\nGoals that promote app usage\nGoals that improve the app\nGoals that improve smart contract\n\n\n\n\n\nGoal\nDeadline\n$ORANGE \nHow distributed?\n1\nLeaderboard view\n__\nTurn the “Browse Startups” into the “Leaderboard” view.

There is no reimbursement to members for execution of this proposal or attending the retreat.\n\n\n(Proposed) Retreat Details\nRetreat from April 6 (Wed)- April 10 (Su). This is a collaborative team activity - folks will fly in Wed evening and fly out Su afternoon-evening. \n Interest is submitted here.\nDao to cover 100% of the following expenses -\nStay\nFlight\nFood\nUber to Airport, Hotel and back\nTeam activity\n(Proposed) Retreat is open to all members, prioritized in the following order:\nCommittee Members (Governance, Treasury, Development)\nContributors (Those who have delivered on an OIP in current season, or committed code)\nProposal writers\nThose who have voted on 3+ proposals\nMembers who joined before Dec 31, 2021\nAll Members (ordered by interest submission date)\nLocation\nMexico (Cancun/Cabo)\nWe are looking for a space that can host 20 people and have the environment to support the creative work that will occur.\n\n\nRetreat Agenda\nTo be finalized\n\n(Proposed) Topics (we’ll need to trim this list)\nS0 Retro\nGovernance\nTreasury\nDevelopment\nInternal Comms\nBD\nFund\nProposals\nOther? \nOrange Vision\nWhat have we learned from S0\nHow has it evolved?\nWhat new opportunities are we seeing\nWhat is the biggest, most ambitious vision Orange can have?\n\n\nContributors\nRemoving friction (including proposal friction)\nIncentivizing\nWhat kind of contributor persona do we want to attract?\nFund Related Topics\nOrion?\nExternal Comms\nWhat is our shared narrative to the world?\nHow hard do we want to go on marketing to the world?\nInternal Comms\nWho is our customer?

      "content": "Full proposal doc:\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1-jPu2BBXT_Ub8NmIVLA5f6yXDJrr8WHj6elIkblqJuI/edit#heading=h.3bs9563px4gi\n\nSingle Point of Contact: David Head (davidh.eth)\nGoal:\nTo compensate myself for work done since Nov ‘21, and will maintain for the rest of Season 0.\nWork Summary\nWhen I joined the DAO in October ‘21, new members were “signing up” by posting their wallet IDs in a Discord channel. None of it was structured, and we had no emails to re-engage people with.\n\nThen separately, all of our major announcements were being posted in Discord. A vast majority of our DAO members (especially the most successful ones) are not active in Discord. It’s too noisy. So we had little way of engaging them more.\n\nAs a solution to this, I designed, built, implemented, and have maintained a new member onboarding workflow to capture structured data on new members including emails, wallet IDs, and Discord IDs. So far 419+ DAO members (~33%) have gone through it to date.\n\nThen I took those profiles and used them to launch a new email communication channel. Currently it has a ~75% open rate and a ~30% click rate, which is ~3.5x and ~10x higher than the industry average, respectively. I’ve been maintaining and distributing communications through this channel to date.\n\nDetails on Contributions & Tokens Requested\nNew Member Onboarding Flow - 25,000 $ORANGE\nWork Duration: (Nov ‘21 - April ‘22)\n\n\nProblem:\nWhen I joined the DAO in October ‘21, new members were “signing up” by posting their wallet IDs in a Discord channel.\n\nWe had about 200 IDs in a channel. None of it was being captured as structured data. And we weren’t capturing any emails to be able to re-engage members with.\nSolution\nI designed and built a new onboarding workflow, then worked with stakeholders to integrate it into the existing onboarding flow channels (i.e. Bookface). \nResulted in capturing structured profiles for 419+ members, or ~33% of the DAO. Still is in use today.\nLine Items\nCleaned Discord data of ~200 members from thread of individual messages listing Discord IDs and Wallets to airdrop $ORANGE tokens into\nSeeded database with Discord IDs, timestamps of submissions, and $ORANGE token wallets.\nSetup dev@ account for tooling to be owned by\nResearched database options\nSetup database\nResearched form options to reliably associate seed data with future emails, preferences, and other data capture\nSetup forms\nAudited current onboarding channels\nDeveloped plan for updating channels to include the new onboarding flow with UX in mind\nWorked with owners of current onboarding flows to execute plan\nContinuous monitoring of onboarding forms for reliability\nIterated on forms to make onboarding more simple as we gained more knowledge on current and future use cases\nGeneral maintenance\nValue:\nBuild an email list of 419+ members (as of 3/10/22)\nLikely captured close to 100-150+ more member profiles due to urgently acting, as the rate of onboarding new members was much higher for a few weeks initially.\nHigh quality seed data for future web applications\nSince the data is structured and email and other metadata is associated with other IDs like Discord ID and Wallet ID, it is able to be higher quality seed data for future Orange DAO applications. This will enable a smoother onboarding experience for “Connect with Wallet” applications. \n\nLaunching Email Communication Channel - 20,000 $ORANGE\nWork Duration: (Nov ‘21 - April ‘22)\n\nProblem: \nIn Nov ‘21, most of the DAO didn’t know what we were doing or how or when to engage.\n\n\nFor example, we were posting newsletter digests in the #announcements channels in Discord. But most of our DAO does not actively use Discord. Especially our most successful members. There are simply too many channels and messages.\nSo any fund activity, new app development, proposal activity, etc wasn’t being seen by most members.\nSolution\nI used the structured member profiles from the New Member Onboarding Workflow to launch an email channel with a ~75% open rate and a ~30% click rate. \nI’ve been distributing our email communications through this channel since Nov ‘21.\nLine Items:\nNewsletter distribution software setup\nSeeding and syncing new member data\nNewsletter template creation, routine enhancements, and maintenance\nRoutine conversion of Notion/PDF into email-acceptable format\nDeliverability audits and troubleshooting\nOngoing communications distribution\nValue:\nIncreased visibility for new applications being developed\nEasier growth channel for new apps to get new members\nIncreased exposure for Orange Fund activities\nIncreased proposal engagement\nIncreased visibility of Orange DAO events\nIncreased visibility for miscellaneous other use cases\n\n\nBuilding Proposal Workflow v1 - 5,000 $ORANGE\nWork Duration: (Nov ‘21)\n\nProblem\nWe didn’t have a way to track proposals being created, or the status of them.\n\nSolution\nSetup a no-code workflow for members to clone a template and progress through a series of steps, which would track the statuses of which in a database.\nWork Done\nDrafted spec with governance leaders to go from template > comments > dissents > final, as well as auto-increment numbers and track stages\nCirculated spec for feedback\nFinalized spec\nEvaluated database solutions\nSetup forms to track status changes at each stage change\nSetup notifications and messages from dev@ accounts with instructions\nSetup workflow automation software\nRefined flows for UX (comprehensibility)\nLaunched to community for use on OIP-10 and forward\nMaintained software\nValue\nHelped initiate a pre-proposal system and workflow for DAO improvements.\nHelped track proposal statuses across DAO.\n\nHow was the $ORANGE comp determined?\n\nValue driven to the DAO. We could assume that just one hyper-successful member in our DAO could drive millions or more in value. Before my work here, it was unlikely that many, if any, of those hyper-successful members knew about any of the projects we were working on. Now it’s likely that many of them are regularly seeing ways to engage.\n\nThe stage of the DAO. The bulk of my time on these projects was spent working in Q4 ‘21. $ORANGE tokens didn’t exist then even, so there was little idea of what their value should be for project work. It seems like there should be a premium placed on work done at this point relative to now when it is more clear.\n\n\nUsing other project comp as a benchmark. Other projects in Q4 ‘21 had up to 1,000,000 tokens allocated to them at this point. Granted, those were much more technically complex and had multiple members getting token distribution. So I’ve adjusted for that accordingly.\n\nToken Distribution: \n50,000 $ORANGE to be paid out immediately to davidh.eth.\n\n(Sponsors’ control)\n$ORANGE\n\n\nRisks: \n(Open to All Members)\n\n\nCounterpoints:\n(Open to All Members)\n\n\nADMIN: FOR TREASURY: \nTransactions Upon Passing:\nSend 50,000 $ORANGE \nFrom: 0xXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX (Treasury Gnosis Multisig)\nTo: 0x16D56FA9b31479315a05b0b31F83D88f5F8Ca6e4 (davidh.eth’s wallet)\n\n\nSpecial thanks to the following 🍊’s for helping me revise:\nMaqq\nEnx\nHuh.eth\nDon Ho\nOparrott.eth\nCryptpalsingh\nJohnny Chin\nByron\n",

Do not include folks who are just supportive of this proposal. \n@maqq#6908\n\nDescription:\nThis is a proposal to send 7,000 tokens to Orange DAO members mrmemes.eth (5,000 tokens) and maqq (2,000 tokens) for executing OIP-2. \n\nOIP-2 required determining early contributors, measured by number of messages sent pre 11/1 and to manage the 1M token distribution to all of those contributors.\n\nThe management and execution of this proposal was time consuming. \nOn the tech side, the Discord API had unforeseen complexities which turned this into a long task\nOn the non-tech side, there was coordination among recipients, pursuing dev help and QA.\n\nMr. Memes build a library for this and future proposals that require querying Discord chat history for message counts scoped to a given channel and/or across a date range. We will use this for executing OIP-2, OIP-10 and will come in handy for more projects in the future that need to pull Discord message data. See Count-de-Monet here:\nhttps://github.com/voxdolo/count-de-monet\n\nI appreciated Mr. Meme’s willingness to help me (maqq) execute OIP-002. He wasn’t offered and didn’t expect compensation for helping. It’s important for me that he’s treated right for being a selfless contributor.\n\nBenefits:\nIn order for Orange DAO to thrive, we need to encourage contributions of all sizes and to compensate our contributors.\n\nThis proposal proves we’re interested in compensating each other for contributing in one-off, small projects.\n\nSuccess Metrics:\nKPIs before proposal: N/A\nKPIs after proposal: 7k $ORANGE sent to two contributors\nSuccess Confidence: 100%\n(If this proposal was executed 100 times, how many times will it meet its goal?)\n\nDuration:\nStart: within 1 week of approval\nEnd: within 1 week of approval\n\nTokens Requested: (Treasury control)\n$ORANGE Total: 7,000\n\nToken Distribution: (Sponsors’ control)\n$ORANGE \n[@Mrmemes]: 5,000\n[@Maqq]: 2,000\n\nRISKS: (Open to All Members)\n\n\nCOUNTERPOINTS: (Open to All Members)\n\n\nADMIN: FOR TREASURY: \nTransactions Upon Passing:\nSend 7000 $ORANGE \nFrom: 0xXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX (Treasury Gnosis Multisig)\nTo: 0xXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX ([Name1]’s wallet)\n",

      "content": "Full Proposal in Google Doc format:\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1TAfrz6da_e9V4oz3w9XjW88T-0kPG_65VRLG1e3bXkE/edit#\n\nGoal:\nRun pilot of Compensation Fast Track system for DAO contributors and develop a recommendation for operationalizing non-proposal compensation moving forward.\n\nSingle Point of Contact: (Only 1 individual for GovC to reach out with questions, and to represent at TownHall.)\nMaqq\n\nSponsors: Include folks planning to work on this proposal. Do not include folks who are just supportive of this proposal. \nMaqq, Chingularity\n\nDescription:\nCurrently, DAO contributors can only be compensated via proposal. We’ve identified some issues with this:\n\nWe risk proposal and voter fatigue.\nAs we get more contributors, there could be many more proposals in the near future. This could create a situation where people simply tune out because of the high cost of understanding the many proposals.\nThe current system disadvantages members less comfortable with self-promotion.\nMight disincentivize contributing.\nContributors may be less likely to contribute if it means that they have to navigate the proposal process to get juicy.  \nCompensation only through proposals could create a Goldrush mentality.\nIt's subjective what value/effort of a contribution corresponds with what quantity of tokens. The current proposal method risks creating a parasitic relationship with the DAO where there is no reason to not ask for more tokens than is appropriate. \nSome tasks or contributions might not “feel worth it” to go through the proposal writing and voting process but should be compensated nonetheless.  We want to reward contributors both great and small.  Progress isn’t always about the big initiatives.  It can also be the sum of the little things.   This mechanism is especially designed for hard working contributors who don’t want to write an entire proposal for something they did.  Or did something but have no idea how much they should be compensated for it.\n\nEnter Crowdsourced Compensation, a WIP idea that may address these concerns. Crowdsourced Compensation is a batched compensation event in which we split a pool of 50k tokens across a list of all contributors/projects during that period.\n\nHow it works\nOver the course of a month, contributors can nominate work done by themselves or others to be included over the course of a month by providing Name, ETH address, short description of task and value to the DAO. \n\nAt the end of the month, we use Coordinape to crowdsource the weighting of how to distribute the pool across that month's contributions.\n\nFor more context on the discussion around Crowdsourced Compensation, see this thread:\nhttps://discord.com/channels/883048687012544653/883048687012544657/938914619584557066\n\nPilot\nTo test the idea we will open a period of one week during which we will invite all DAO members to nominate their own contributions by filling out a Google form to collect:\nName\nETH address\nShort description of task\nValue to the DAO\n\nEligible contributions will be all contributions that happened since the charter was passed on 11/8 and are not already covered via proposal or charter. All contributions since 11/8 will be included because one of the main intents of this experiment is to make sure all contributions in the DAO don’t go unnoticed, including the early days.\n\nThere is no capped number of contributions for this experiment.\n\nThen, we’ll open up a 3-day period in which all DAO members will use Coordinape to read about eligible contributions and decide on the allocation they think makes sense. The tool weighs all submissions and comes to a blended outcome.\n\nAt the end of the 3 day voting period, the 50k tokens will be divided among the recipients according to the voting.\n\nMaqq and Johnny will get feedback from participants and deliver a retrospective on positives, negatives and areas of improvement of the system. They will also deliver a recommendation on if and how to operationalize this moving forward based on the outcome of the pilot. If we receive feedback that there needs to be more than 50k tokens to compensate contributors, one outcome may be to allocate more tokens retroactively on top of the original experiment.\n\n\nRoadmap, KPIs and awards\nAt the end of the \n\n\n\n\nGoal\nDeadline\n$ORANGE\n\n\n1\nSuccessfully run pilot\n3 weeks after proposal passes\n0 (Sponsors will be compensated for this KPI via Compensation Fast Track)\n\n\n2\nCollect feedback from at least 6 participants and develop retrospective on Compensation Fast Track to answer key questions:\nSuccesses\nFailures\nImprovements\n2 weeks after pilot is complete\n10k\n\n\n3\nSponsors give recommendation to DAO on if/how to operationalize Compensation Fast Track moving forward based on feedback and\n1 week after feedback is collected\n10k\n\n\n\n\n\nBenefits:\nLess proposals!\nCompensate past contributors who might not get $Orange otherwise.\nCreates a path for members to be compensated without navigating the bureaucracy and self-promotion that proposals favor.\nSmaller, but necessary and important tasks have a higher likelihood of getting done\nGenerally experimenting with new models of compensation will probably lead to new ideas.\n\nSuccess Metrics:\nKPIs before proposal: \n$ORANGE distributed via Crowdsourced Compensation: 0\nKPIs after proposal:\n$ORANGE distributed via Crowdsourced Compensation: 50,000\nSuccess Confidence: \n(If this proposal was executed 100 times, how many times will it meet its goal?)\n70%\n\nDuration:\nStart: Season 0, less than 1 week after proposal passage based on sponsors’ availabilities\nEnd: Start + 5 weeks\n\nTokens Requested: (Treasury control)\n$ORANGE Total: 70k\n\nToken Distribution: (Sponsors’ control)\n$ORANGE\nSplit among contributors according to Coordinape vote: 50k\nMaqq: 10k\nChingularity: 10k\n\n\nRISKS: (Open to All Members)\nBy [Member1]\n\n\nBy [Member2]\n\n\nBy [Member3]\n\n\n\nCOUNTERPOINTS: (Open to All Members)\nBy [Member4]\n\n\nBy [Member5]\n\n\n\nADMIN: FOR TREASURY: \nTransactions Upon Passing:\n",

      "content": "Full Details\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1pzQa85vUKLENXPG_Pd1OwNYIMQ88ktQQv8HuOC2XtiM/edit#heading=h.jihimw60zxbi\n(This proposal contains detailed indented lists of token distribution and rewards. Snapshot's formatting does not reflect this. Please use the Google Doc instead to review.\n\nGoal\nCreate v1 of a working system to enable Orange Fund Portfolio Companies to receive support from Orange DAO members and Orange Fund LPs\n\nPoint of Contact\n@Byron#4552 \n\nSponsors\n@JeremiahSmith#5560, @tilde#2915, @pineapple#5176, @annapinol#3471, @Byron#4552\n\nDescription\nBackground\n\nOrange DAO is uniquely qualified to provide massive value to Fund Portfolio Companies (“PortCos”) because of the broad network of talent within its Members.  We seek to unlock the free flow of value between the Fund and the DAO such that they may help each other in mutually beneficial ways. \n\nThis is the first step forward in creating systems that can provide structural long-term value for the DAO and Fund. Similar to how YC has bookface, office hours, etc that makes it easier for us to share value with each other, if we can establish the processes and cultural norms, it helps the value-flow happen. Inversely, when funds are just like \"tell us how we can be helpful\" - often that doesn't go anywhere.  because it's just too broad. Instead, we will give PortCos a \"menu\" of ways that we can help, that makes it easy for them to say yes. Then we need the systems to meet those needs scalably.\n\nDeliverables\nFor this initial v1 of the Portfolio Support System, we will create the core infrastructure for PortCos to start receiving the help they need.  \n\nThe plan is to create:\nPortCo Onboarding document + experience\nAn onboarding [Notion] document for PortCos which includes a suggested process and tips to get started with Orange DAO\nPortCo Support System\nA database of PortCos\n[ie a form to create and update profiles that we work with the Fund to ask all PortCos to complete]\nA way for PortCos to post and easily update their current needs for help. \n[ie a secure form to update current needs per PortCo]\nA way for help requests to get channeled to the best destinations\n[ie Zapier automations to send different types of requests to specific Discord Channels, people who will take action, or other content databases]\nA gated way for Members and LPs to browse PortCos needs, to assess where they can help then volunteer\n[ie a gallery where all current needs can be viewed with token gating]\nA way for Members and LPs to volunteer to help meet these needs.  \n[ie the above gallery containing contact info and Cal links for booking]\nAssistance + Compensation Tracking System\nA way to track when Members volunteer to help serve PortCo requests or otherwise provide value\nA simple way to track the status of their $ORANGE compensation  \nEstablish a team (Portco Support Committee) until the end of Season 1, which will:\nAct as Point-of-Contact to receive requests from PortCos, and ensure some timely response to every request\nTriage PortCo needs and updates into the system as needed\nHelp ping known resources within the DAO to facilitate PortCo requests\nCoordinate and iterate on help requests\nIteration often looks like replying to the PortCo to request additional details such that the needs are clearly understood, so that assistance can be provided. \nProvide cleaned and updated request summaries to publish in Member email newsletter\nRegularly ping PortCos to update their needs\nCoordinate marketing amplification requests\nTriage Fund requests to coordinate w PortCos as needed\nProvide reports on Support utilization and assistance provided\nBenefits\nBuild an MVP of a PortCo support mechanism \nSupport PortCo onboarding to Orange DAO\nImprove ability of Orange Fund/Orange DAO to support portfolio companies\nIncrease engagement and satisfaction of Orange DAO Members by providing opportunities to interact with and help other founders\nSuccess Metrics / KPIs\nPercentage of PortCos onboarded into database (minimum 60%, target 90%+)\nPercentage of PortCos in database that have submitted some sort of help request (minimum 50%, target 70%)\nPercentage of PortCos that have received some assistance (minimum 40%, target 60%)\nMonitor number of live Orange Hour sessions (no target)\nMonitor number of asynchronous help requests completed (no target)\nMonitor number of unique DAO members providing assistance (no target)\n\nDuration\nStart: Upon approval \nEnd: End of Season 1\n\n**Tokens Requested - 206,000 $ORANGE in total**\n**Treasury control**\n86,000 $ORANGE total for creating and supporting the system through Season 1\n15,000 for initial planning, user research, testing, and iteration (Byron#4552)\n1,000 for proposal writing (Byron#4552)\n10,000 for creating the PortCo Onboarding document + experience \n7,500 for primary creation to JeremiahSmith#5560\n2,500 for feedback and support to Byron#4552\n40,000 for creating the v1 PortCo Support System\n30,000 for primary development to Byron#4552\n10,000 for development support to JeremiahSmith#5560\n20,000 for creating the Assistance + Compensation Tracking System\n15,000 for primary development to pineapple#5176\n5,000 for development support to Byron#4552\n\n**Sponsors’ control**\n120,000 $ORANGE to fund additional compensation for DAO Members\n30,000 $ORANGE total to fund Members (& maybe LPs) that provide assistance to PortCos through Season 1\n$ORANGE payments for help will be paid at the discretion of the PortCo Support Committee\nProjecting 100 $ORANGE per hour live Orange Hours call\nProjecting 50 $ORANGE 30 minute live Orange Hours call\nProjecting 50 $ORANGE per asynchronous written help\nProjecting 1 $ORANGE per re-tweet (would need someone else to build the tracking system for this)\nAmounts may be adjusted as required to meet supply and demand by the Sponsors\n\nUnused $ORANGE by the end of Season 1 will be refunded to the Treasury\n\n40,000 for PortCo Support Committee to coordinate and support PortCo requests through Season 1 \n\nCurrently volunteering to help\npineapple#5176\ntilde#2915\nannapinol#3471\nByron#4552\nJeremiahSmith#5560\npeerrich.eth#3508\nmaqq#6908\n\nWelcome additional Members as we get started, we hope others will show interest\nFinal allocation of the 40,000 $ORANGE will be allocated fairly by group consensus of the Sponsors according to help given\n50,000 $ORANGE for additional compensation for DAO Members that complete necessary but currently unforeseen work required to meet the goals.  \nGiven the solution is still being developed, it is likely that the final strategy will continue to evolve as things are built and tested.  These tokens will allow fair compensation and flexibility to adapt as the scope of work changes. \nCould comprise either additional building, or additional support activities\nFinal allocation of the 50,000 $ORANGE will be allocated fairly by group consensus of the Sponsors\n\nRISKS: (Open to All Members)\nByron: If there is not enough volunteers, PortCos may stop using the system if they don’t find it valuable\nByron: PortCo Support Committee would have ability to self-select or otherwise influence member volunteers\nEnx: tremendous scope could lead to not finishing, late delivery, difficult to track status, etc.\n\nCOUNTERPOINTS: (Open to All Members)\nByron: If there are not enough volunteers, we would probably not mind if Committee members did self-select, as some volunteers are better than none.\nByron: to Enx’s point: I added some additional detail up above to make the deliverables more clear and tangible.  Hope that helps.  The current plan is to use something simple like Airtable with some automations.  I’m looking into alternatives to see if we can easily improve the UX without increasing the work too much.

      "content": "**Google Doc:** https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hR9BCzO0QT_ftRdzn25qZTLa03UXWxZ7k6tF2Wxj_MU/edit#heading=h.ddfcrao9n93f\n\n**Goal:** Goal of this proposal is to hire someone in a full time role for Internal Comms. \n\n**Point of Contact:**\nCryptpal Singh\n**Sponsors:**\n@cryptpalsingh, @huh.eth, @ricardoG, @enx\n\n**Role Description:**\nThis role is called Internal Comms. However, it is about 1 singular thing: removing friction from members participating in the dao.\nThis role will report to GovC. \n\n**Vision:**\nDAOs are massively parallel and decentralized - which increase the amount of required communication, coordination and add friction to participate (to an already difficult challenge).  \nThe best DAOs know this and will address these by proactively identifying and removing friction, laying the groundwork for transparent & clear communication, and investing in ways to reduce “cost of participation” for members.\n\nThis will prevent  members from being overwhelmed, allowing members with different levels of commitments to jump in and contribute quickly (equipping them with the right amount of coordination and context they need).\n\nOur DAO has the potential of truly accelerating web3 and becoming a digital nation of builders. However, just like a startup - it isn’t a given, and to get there - we’ll need a layer of support for our builders to come in and take asymmetric bets in furthering our vision. At it’s best, this role would feel slightly more than an invisible layer.\n\nLastly,  this role is about applying founder energy to enable the dao to move faster by doing what it takes to continuously reduce noise, and remove bottlenecks & friction from builders building. This will be achieved through a combination of individual contribution, enabling others, delegating & sharing responsibilities with cooperative members of the dao.\nIn some ways, you can draw parallels to a growth role at a fast growing startup (except internally focused)\n\n**Measuring Role Success: **\nSuccess of this role is in increasing “Ease of Contribution to the DAO” (or DCE) for DAO members. To measure this we will measure an NPS equivalent multiple times a season. \n\nTo start, we will ask the following  3 questions 3x/season: \nOn a scale of 1-10, how easy is it for you to contribute to the DAO?\nWhat is 1 thing the dao can work on to make it easier for you to contribute?\nDo you wish to contribute? \nS0, we will use this to create a benchmark.\n\nS1 onwards - GovC and member in this role will determine goals for the season based on this. As we learn more about the underlying levers, some seasons may focus on sub-goals impacting this metric.  These goals will be published under Committees/InternalComms/SeasonGoals on our knowledge center. \n\n\n**Selection of Candidate:**\nGovC will choose the candidate from a list of volunteers that self select, current list of candidates applying for this role: \n\n**Add your name if you’re interested in being a candidate. **\nDiscord Username: cryptpalsingh#6143\nNotes: cryptpal has a \"history of work\" which in DAO time represents a substantial amount of time that shouldn't be overlooked. He's been spearheading the newsletter, all over discord onboarding, updating notion, and more (speaking for myself) probably not seen by anyone who isn't in every channel. All done for free to my knowledge. - sayangel\n\n\n**Removal of Candidate:**\nGovC and/or individual can terminate this role based on performance/at will with 14 day notice and begin searching for the next candidate. If there is no candidate in the list, they will open this for a bid that will be open for 30 days and if no one is suitable after 30 days this OIP will be closed. \n\nIf the candidate is removed or leaves prior to the end of the season they will be paid on a prorated basis. Their replacement will be paid a prorated amount for the remainder of the season. \n\n**Duration:**\nStart: Season 0\nEnd: Continues indefinitely unless terminated as described above. \n\n**Compensation:**\nBase Compensation: 280K $ORANGE/Season\nPerformance adjustment: if DCE score 20% over previous season, add 100K $ORANGE. If 20% under of the previous season, subtract 100K $ORANGE.\nReference calculations: Current Committee Comp is 55K/Season for 5-10 hours/week. Scaling this to Full Time(40 hrs): At 55K/7.5 Hrs/wk → 293K/40hrs/wk\n\n\n**Tokens Requested: (Treasury control)**\n$ORANGE Total: 280,000 (per season)\n\n**Token Distribution: (Sponsors’ control)**\n$ORANGE\nS0: 280,000\n\n\nRISKS: (Open to All Members)\n\n\n\nCOUNTERPOINTS: (Open to All Members)\n\n\n\nADMIN: FOR TREASURY: \nTransactions Upon Passing:\nNo action until end of Season 0.\n",

      "content": "**To see with full formatting, see this Google Doc:**\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1XCU6u9K1hTeB_WzpG_dbYbHkTlGdMfu_Z3GpnRZHJvw/edit#\n\n**Goal:**\nFund one startup building an RFS that we choose by DAO vote.\n\n**Point of Contact:**\nenx#8760\n\n**Sponsors:**\nrmnnmrl#8419, luke#4975; enx#8760\n\n**Description:**\nAs we build the DAO, we have found products we need or want. Good initial work was done to capture these; a Request For Startups channel and web documents were built. This proposal builds off that work to generate at least one strong candidate for investment.\n\n**How this will work:**\nPublicly publish and promote the top RFSes the DAO has come up with, choose the best candidate to invest in as a DAO, and complete a $100k investment from Orange Fund I.\n\n**Details:**\nWeek 1: sponsors narrow down RFSs to top 10 & get sanity check from GPs (30-minute Zoom call). Sponsors also update response to RFS intake form.\nWeek 2-3: publicize RFSes for two weeks to get submissions\nWeek 4: DAO votes on best investment \nWeek 5: GP diligence sanity check & 100k investment gets made\nWe will try go get a clear checklist in advance and publicize it to the RFS responding companies so that the list is pre-filtered\n\n**Suggestions for future exploration:**\ni.e. things we’re leaving out for now, to move quickly with focused scoping, which could be explored in future iterations: \nGenerating more RFS ideas\nUpdating the RFS generation process (intake form, viewing, rating, shared editing, etc.)\nGetting DAO members to rank RFS ideas\nIncentivizing DAO members to rank or vote (i.e. 100 $ORANGE if you vote on x number)\nPre-committing the Fund investment using smart contracts\nCo-investment by DAO members, either pre-committed or traditional\n\n**Benefits:**\nHelps make Orange the first place for coalescing startups to look for assistance\nFund does well because promising candidates identified (which ultimately increases the value of the treasury)\nCommunity members interested in investments get direct input into the process (and exposure to startups in which they might want to directly invest)\n\n**Success Metrics:**\nNumber of responses to RFSes submitted: minimum acceptable 4, target 100.\nNumber of DAO members voting on submissions: minimum acceptable 25, target 200.\nNumber of startups accepting investment: 1\n\n**Duration:**\nStart: Within 1 week of approval\nEnd: Approx. 5 weeks after Start. \nNote: This OIP is tightly scoped; we anticipate submitting another OIP to continue if successful.\n\n**Tokens Requested: (Treasury control)**\n\nMuch time and effort is required to read through, prioritize, and trim the RFSs.\n\nThe work performed has the potential to positively impact the DAO \n\nThe impact on the DAO may be tremendous if all goes according to plan, especially if the chosen startup is successful. It is similar to the core function of a fund General Partner. If the Fund makes 10 investments in a season, the contribution can be thought of as something like 1/10 of a GP contribution. Of course they have other obligations and legal responsibilities, on the other hand much of the work proposed here is not something GPs need to perform. Let us use 1/10th as a simplification. That gives 66k per Sponsor. Then, all community members who participate are also creating some of this value; by voting on candidates, creating requests, etc. If each Sponsor is awarded 50K (a simple number) then 16K per Sponsor is available for the community. If the tokens were divided evenly and all DAO members contributed, this would be approx. 48 tokens each (48000 $ORANGE / ~1000 members). In order not to dis-incentivize sharing among DAO members (i.e. hold denominator constant), let us award a constant amount for anyone who participates. Let us also round 48 up to 50 $ORANGE since these are not precise numbers. Then we have $ORANGE 50 each up to a total of $ORANGE 48000; capping the total $ORANGE also provides an incentive to participate early (tokens on only available to the first 960 members = $ORANGE 48,000 total / $ORANGE 50 each).\n\nFinally, since this may be operationally complex, and the DAO seeks more ways for members to get involved (specifically non-technical members), allow Sponsors to allocate up to 2000 $ORANGE for member(s) assisting with accurately identifying and awarding DAO members who participated.\n\n**Then we have 200,000 total $ORANGE as:**\n\n$ORANGE Total: 200,000\nFor Team: 150,000 total (50,000 to each Sponsor)\nCreate plan, proposal, gain DAO approval.\nCreate, and share to DAO, an updated standard format for RFSes\nNarrow down RFSs to top 10 & get sanity check from GPs\nCollaborate with DAO members to publicize\nGather responses\nGet DAO members to vote on responses\nShare final choice to GPs and confirm investment\nShare final results to DAO\n\n**For any DAO member that participates: 100 each up to 48,000 total (i.e first 480 to participate).**\nAt Sponsors’ discretion: 2K available to award for assistance with accurately tracking and awarding the correct DAO members\n\n**Token Distribution: (Sponsors’ control)**\nFor Team: ½ on Start, ½ upon completion.\nFor DAO members: no later than start of following season; members must be identified and counted\n\n**RISKS: (Open to All Members)**\nBy [luke#4975,enx]\nSimilar to LFG?\nLFG expected to focus on later stage startups and recommending for YC\nThis (RFS) early stage ideas which startups could (have recently) form(ed) around\n\n**Additional thanks to**\nJohnny Chin\nAlexander Mistakidis\nDon Ho\nBen Huh\nOrion Parrott\nStephen Caudill\nAngel Say\nChris Stanley\nDavid H\n",

      "content": "**Goal:**\nProvide 250,000 $ORANGE to gem contributors for developing the gem. And allocate 750,000 $ORANGE for meeting KPIs.\n\n**Vision:**\nDevelop an on-chain verification for YC Founders/OrangeDAO members. This will become the passport for members to join other DAOs, engage with projects from OrangeDAO members, and have exclusive access to projects on web3 that want our members as investors, supporters, mentors, collaborators, and/or partners. \n\nOur gem becomes the key way for external projects to engage our members and also a way for members to gate their projects to other gem holders. It’s now shown that engaging with trusted parties first to launch a network before rolling out to the broader ecosystem creates more stability and allows for projects to better iterate without worrying about getting rekt on their alpha. \n\nLastly, given the power of OrangeDAO our Gem provides a critical advantage to our key external members to negotiate large grants with different L1/L2 networks as our Gem serves as a prominent example of getting things done fast. Additionally, the Gem provides the first on-ramp onto a network + name recognition, lastly those projects can claim YC founders/OrangeDAO members are using their project which makes their token juicier. \n\n**Pitch to external DAOs to enable Gem auth:**\nWe have 1000 YC founders part of OrangeDAO that are both looking to work on web3 projects to onboard as developers and engage <your DAO> teams on high growth projects. \n\nIn our discord, we have current and former YC partners, YC employees, and YC investors. Additionally, OrangeDAO is working on LFG game to invest deeply into web3 projects so as <your DAO> teams form around projects they can jump into our shared channel to promote their projects. Basically, more OrangeDAO members as part of <your DAO> and vice versa will lead to mutually better outcomes in terms of more funding, more partnerships, and more developers exposed to each others' projects.\n\nThis move is highly marketable making <your token> more valuable to your existing and new hodlers.\n\n**Sponsors:**\n@lebek.eth, @chingularity, @prego, @sayangel, @Jarosss, @chums.sol, @iamdonho, @voska, @wyc, @hans_klaus\n\n**Description:**\n5% of Season 1 Token Pool (5,000,000 $ORANGE). \nThat means there are 250,000 tokens across 5 core members (80% or 200,000 $ORANGE) and 3 contributing members (20% or 50,000 $ORANGE). \nAdditional KPI Awards: (Funds disbursed until exhausted for total of 750,000 $ORANGE)\nSee Full Details for how this is allocated.\n\n**Full Details:**\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/14XxErefrqDZJwVx-hs5J3_lfz_B9Quv1ckxZ-_iyVFY/edit#\n",

As we all know, the riskiest part of any endeavor is the earliest parts. This proposal aims to reward these early contributors.\n\nAn allocation of 1 million $ORANGE from the Genesis Contributor Token Pool (total of 5M tokens) will be divided across members of the Discord prior to November 1, 2021  according to the allocation system chosen in the proposal (A or B). \n\nProposal:\n\nAllocation option A\nAllocation is proportional to the number of messages a member sent to the Discord server prior to 11/1/21, acting as a proxy for participation. Caveat: messages sent to deleted channels can’t be counted.\n\nAllocation option B\nAllocation is determined via nomination form in which members are asked to nominate pre-Nov 1 contributors according to the weight of their contributions.

      "content": "Goal:\nMake it possible for all DAO members to claim $ORANGE tokens as soon as they join.\n\t\nSponsors:\nkrel.eth, alexanderzone, ayan, oparrott\n\nDescription:\n$ORANGE tokens, each representing one DAO vote, should be available to claim for future members who join the DAO as well as members who missed the Genesis Event of signing the charter before 11/21/2021.\n\nIt is in the best interest of the DAO to align all members at large by signing the charter and to motivate them to contribute in building the DAO, and enable them to engage in governance.\n\nSetting up a process for ongoing distribution of $ORANGE tokens is an important step to ensure alignment and ownership. It’s worth noting that the bulk of governance tokens will be distributed within budgets for projects and other productive DAO activities — the initial allocation we provide to members in the following proposal simply ensures that all have a baseline of governance participation (i.e. the ability to vote).\n\nProposal:\n\nVOTING OPTION A: An elegant formula: As a reward for completing steps to join the DAO and mint their YC Gem, new DAO members in each successive season, including Season 0, receive half the $ORANGE tokens compared to the previous season (or compared to Genesis Epoch in the case of Season 0) until a floor of 100 $ORANGE per new member is reached. \n\nVOTING OPTION B: As a reward for completing steps to join the DAO and mint their YC Gem, new DAO members in each of Seasons 0, 1, and 2, receive 2000 $ORANGE. Future seasons to be decided by future proposal.\n\nFull Proposal Document:\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1UTJWZs2kUzR4nEogWCafENHbn3sRf1C8HNUbdfyatpA/edit#",
