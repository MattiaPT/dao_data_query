      "title": "FFIP-27: Dissolving the Forefront DAO",
      "content": "The Forefront Core Team is recommending to dissolve the Forefront DAO and return capital to participants of the 2021 Treasury Diversification Round (TDR).\n\nIf approved, all funds will be distributed to their respective TDR participants proportionate to their participation in the round.\n\n### How We Got Here\n\nOver the last three years, the Forefront core team has worked tirelessly to produce high-quality and useful media and products for the crypto ecosystem. Specifically, Forefront pioneered key social token tooling and social DAO participation frameworks while producing content that uplifted key voices and ideas, including our industry-renowned newsletter.\n\nWhile countless contributions have been made to our community and ecosystem, we misjudged the market and failed to keep our community involved through the process. Forefront DAO lost momentum in the bear market, and our team was unable to find traction across various products and service offerings.\n\n### Why Return Capital\n\nAfter careful consideration, the existing core team determined that returning capital was a necessary decision. Given that there is no longer a clear route to profitability for the DAO, the team decided it is best to uphold its responsibility to TDR participants and return remaining funds.\n\n### Distributing Capital\n\nIf this proposal is approved, the core team will reach out to each TDR participant individually with their expected distribution amount. After confirming their wallet address, the requisite funds will be sent from the DAO treasury.\n\nWe plan to distribute funds by the end of March.\n\n### $FF Token\n\n$FF has always been deemed a governance token and should not be viewed as an investment vehicle. While those who received tokens directly from the treasury in exchange for USD during the TDR will receive their remaining funds back, $FF token holders who did not participate in the TDR will be unable to claim funds.\n\nAs part of this proposal, all $FF remaining in the treasury will be burned. Remaining $FF will continue as a permissionless ERC20 for anyone to integrate or build around.\n\n### Quorum\nQuorum: Minimum 5% of all currently circulating $FF (excluding treasury tokens) must participate for the proposal to pass.\nPassing Threshold: 65% or more of voting members must vote YES for the proposal to pass.\n\n---",

      "content": "Author\n------\nForefront Core Contributors\n\nSummary\n------\n\nFor the last two years, \"membership\" in Forefront has been a fuzzy topic. Some Discord channels and products were gated by 100 $FF. Some were gated by 1000 $FF. Some events required no membership, while others were only for Genesis NFT holders.\n\nThe lack of legibility around membership in the Forefront community has created external confusion and internal struggles.\n\nToday, we would like to propose the Forefront Membership Pass – an NFT that will serve as the *sole access* token in the Forefront ecosystem. This collection will exist alongside the $FF token, which will continue to serve as the sole governance token.\n\nSpecifications\n------\nDesigned in collaboration with Ikaro Cavalcante (@occult3d) , each NFT embodies the emergence and fluidity of tokenized communities through the juxtaposition of the Infinity Flow across a multitude of backgrounds grounded in natural colors, patterns, and tones.\n\nOur goal is to continue to make the Forefront community the premier space for discussion and research on tokenized communities, web3 social, and the intersection of web3 and media.\n\nForefront Membership Passes grant access to:\n- All gated media and reports\n- Forefront Discord\n- Early access to all future drops\n- Forefront Signal and community Pulse board\n- Virtual and IRL community events\n\nFunds will go to the Forefront treasury, with a total of 2.5% of revenue being distributed to designers and contributors who assisted in NFT development.\n\n#### What if I'm already a part of the Forefront community?\nForefront has a long history of bringing together some of the earliest explorers in tokenized communities.\n\n*All Season 1, Off SZN, and Season 2 contributors will be able to mint a FF Membership Pass for free (just pay gas).*\n\nMembers of partner communities (listed below) can participate in the presale, minting a Membership Pass at a discounted rate.\n\n#### Who can participate in the Presale?\nPresale participants will be able to mint the Membership Pass at a discounted rate (0.25 ETH). Whitelisted Presale partner communities include:\n\n- Seed Club\n- Krause House\n- Lil Nouns\n- Protein\n- RADAR\n- Water & Music\n- Folklore\n- FWB\n- CabinDAO\n- Nouns\n- Forefront Genesis NFT holders\n\nIf you held tokens in any of these communities as of November 22, 2022, you will be able to participate in the Presale.\n\n#### How much does the Public Sale cost?\n0.3 ETH\n\n#### Is the Forefront Membership Pass a governance token?\nThe Forefront Membership Pass is NOT a governance token.\n\n$FF is still the sole governance token in the Forefront ecosystem, while the Membership Pass is the sole access token throughout the ecosystem.\n\n#### Will there be more Forefront Membership Passes?\nToday, there are 888 membership passes available.\n\n$FF token holders will be able to propose and vote on the NFT inflation mechanic, including how many more passes will exist in the future and the system by which they will be minted.\n\nCost Breakdown\n------\n\n- NFT Art commission: $1500 to @occult3d\n- NFT Minting costs: TBD (retro to core contributor post minting)\n\nQuorum\n------\n\nQuorum: Minimum 5% of all currently circulating $FF (excluding treasury tokens) must participate for the proposal to pass.\\\nPassing Threshold: 65% or more of voting members must vote YES for the proposal to pass.\n\nVote\n----\n\nYes — Agree to approve Forefront Membership Pass Proposal\\\nNo — Refuse to reject Forefront Membership Pass Proposal\n* * * * *\n\n*Value.

This has been clear to Forefront from the very beginning, hence why we chose to solely focus on this corner of web3 where communities were coming together with a unified purpose. However, this space is still young and will require new protocols and foundational products to help communities grow their network. That is what Forefront’s Product Circle is focused on. To do this, we need to move fast. Tony has shown the ability to lead the dev team playing a core role in our Terminal product and continuing his impact in our upcoming product launches. This proposal aims to extend Tony’s role at Forefront as Dev Lead.\n\n\n## Specifications\n### Responsibilities\nTony will continue to be responsible for:\n\n- Participating in the design and creation of scalable software driving towards of strategic objective of being web3 social’s trusted information, reputation, and signal layer.\n- Writing clean, functional code on the front- and back-end\n- Testing and fixing bugs or other coding issues\n- Onboarding new Developers\n- Manage and oversee development team\n\n### Compensation Scope\nMonthly compensation of $12,083 USDC;\nFF Compensation: 1% total supply (100,000FF), subject to 2 years vesting period.

      "title": "FFIP-22: Everyone’s a Contributor Proposal",
      "content": "## Author\nDwayne 'The Jock' Ronson\n\n## Summary\nForefront must expand the pool of members whom it considers to be 'contributors'. There are many members who create real value of all kinds that need to be recognized and rewarded. Examples of these may include engaging with the community with comments, suggestions, ideas, offering help, attending events, liking/RT’ing, promoting the DAO in various ways, vibez and just simply being around and present. \n\nThis rewarding initiative aligns psychological, social and financial incentives of the members with the DAO and can potentially kickstart a flywheel of previously-untapped generative activity and permissionless value creation. It fosters trust, credibility and goodwill for the DAO. \n\nThis proposal also has the benefit of increasing the number of $FF wallet holders. Distributing $FF widely is an important goal of Forefront and this can be an effective mechanism during a bear market.\n\nThe rewarding will be done anonymously by a Decentralized Group of Trusted Members (DGTM), who represent the DAO itself in aggregate. This decentralization is crucial for the credible neutrality of the process.\n\n## Motivation\n\n#### Primary Objectives\n\n- Recognize the valuable contributions made by community members which aren’t captured in other buckets.\n- Foster trust, credibility and goodwill for the DAO\n- Motivate new community members to continue to participate, engage, and add value to Forefront.\n- Increase the number of $FF wallet holders.\n- Introduce an additional $FF distribution mechanism.\n- Pioneer a new contributor compensation model in the space.\n\n## Specifications\n- Provide 10-20 trusted community members (DGTM) with 50-150 $FF per month for rewarding purposes. Initial wallets will be determined by the Core Team and will largely consist of current Core Team & Official Contributors;\n- Create a new Discord account called either “DGTM” (or “DAO Reward Bot”...TBD) for collective use by DGTM.\n- Every week, each member in the DGTM may reward value-creators based on their own intuition.  \n\n## Cost\nThe following funds are requested for the 3-month trial period:\n5000 $FF\n\n## Conclusion\nThis proposal is a low-cost way of fostering important values, distributing $FF, and maintaining good vibez in the Forefront DAO. \n\n## Quorum\nQuorum: Minimum 5% of all currently circulating $FF (excluding treasury tokens) or 43119.2 $FF must participate for the proposal to pass.\nPassing Threshold: 65% or more of voting members must vote YES for the proposal to pass.\n\n## Vote\nYes - Vote YES to approve\nNo - Vote NO to reject\n\n***\nValue.

      "content": "## Summary\nThis proposal seeks to onboard CPTNskeletor as a part-time contributor leading FF LABS and contributing to furthering Forefront’s connection to the bubbling web3 ecosystem.\n\n## Motivation\nForefront should be the most well-connected DAO in the space. I can help make this happen. We should have deep relationships with up and coming DAOs. We should be helping to pioneer movements (eg ReFi or Good Growth). We should be experimenting with cutting edge tools (eg Mochi-habit/connection buildingi).\n\nAt the same time, FF Labs is like a web3 powder keg covered in magnets. Builders, creators, people-who-love-to-be-a-part-of-crazy-shit will be attracted to join and help us pump out cool projects. And any one of those could explode into our “constitution DAO” moment and put Forefront in the mainlight.  We are on the edge of an untapped playground.  This enables us to not only be covering web3 culture but creating it!\n\n\n## Specification\nResponsibilities\nStewarding FF LABS through drops, media campaigns, and talent search. \nFoster Forefront DAO ecosystem development by identifying and connecting with up-and-coming Social Token communities, creators, and web3 talent. \nCreating a web of connections between Forefront and all DAOs in the sector.\n\n### Compensation Scope\nMonthly compensation of 3500 USDC;\nFF Compensation: 0.5% of total supply (50,000), vested over 2 years;\nStart date: June 15th\nAs per current guideline, compensation to be revised in 6 months.\n\n## Scorecard\nA comprehensive breakdown of the scorecard can be viewed [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UzExkhA19VrcD-9Yyg5kHbrcoBINIZLHrDkIL0k6Q2Q/edit).\n\n### Evaluation\nPT work expectation and outcome scorecard (with seasonal OKRs) will be set internally. It will serve as guideline, work evaluation also includes members growth, learning and improvement;\nGuideline on termination: In failure to meet expectations or violation of FF values and principles, an re-evaluation discussion will take place between the full time contributors and the staff team. If the decision to terminate is agreed and valid, it will be put into effect by the staff team. In this case contributors monthly and vesting compensation will be immediately ceased.\nIn case of termination, all unvested FF will roll back to treasury in case of termination;\n\n ## Quorum\n- Quorum: Minimum 5% of all currently circulating $FF (excluding treasury tokens) or 43119.2 $FF must participate for the proposal to pass.\n- Passing Threshold: 65% or more of voting members must vote YES for the proposal to pass.\n\n## Vote\nYes - Vote YES to approve Onboard CPTNskeletor as a Part-time contributor leading FF Labs initiative\nNo - Vote NO to reject Onboard CPTNskeletor as a Part-time contributor leading FF Labs initiative\n\n***\n*Value.

      "title": "FFIP-20: FF W3CR Finalist Vote",
      "content": "Title FFIP-20: FF W3CR Finalist Vote\n\n## Sponsor\nThe Community Circle\n\n## Date of Proposal\nJune 6, 2022\n\n## Summary\n\n*Forefront is re-imagining the artist residency for the 21st century metaverse*. Our inaugural Web3 Creator Residency invites 6 world-builders in the Web3 space to workshop their project for an 8-week virtual residency. \n\nWho do you want to observe, learn from and jam with? Our Community - that’s YOU - is given a voice in voting for their favorite finalists.\n\n## Description\nWe have hand selected a pool of 16 finalists from nearly 90 applicants. Hopefully you had the chance to watch all 4 Community Meet & Greets. If you didn’t attend live, you can find the individual recordings in the Creator Profiles, link below.  \n\nBefore voting, we also recommend you take a final look at all the Creator Profiles [here](https://www.notion.so/ffdao/W3CR-Community-Curation-fb8a39193f904d47aec87eac97be112e), to refresh your memory on their bios, project details and Residency game plans.\n\nAt the end of voting, the 3 finalists receiving the most votes from the FF Community will join W3CR 01. The final 3 Resident Creators will be curated by the FF W3CR team.\n\n## How voting power is calculated\nVoting power is based on a combination of your $FF token holdings, how long you have held the $FF and how long you have been a member of the FF Discord, for details see [here](https://www.notion.so/ffdao/Voting-power-breakdown-c37f4cc3f0a8486983af67a34984ef11).\nThe Voting Whitelist is now closed; if you did not sign up *before* the deadline, you will not be able to vote.\n\n## Vote\nWe are using a weighted voting system. Each voter may spread voting power across any number of choices. Our recommendation is that you consider concentrating your voting power on 1 or 2 of your favorite Creators - the ones you would most enjoy learning from and jamming with. The more people you vote for, the more you dilute your vote.\n\nYour voting power will be divided between your chosen candidates according to how much weight, seen as fractionalization of your votes or percentages, you attribute to each finalist.\n\nYou may choose to vote for many finalists, but when casting extremely small votes, bear in mind the actual vote may represent one tenth of 1 vote, so it may be more effective to concentrate voting on a smaller number of finalists.\n\nYou will not know how much voting power you have, until you go to cast your vote the first time. You may either cast it or cancel and return to revise. \n\nWe have prepared loom videos on how to connect your wallet [here](https://www.loom.com/share/089dd3869d6a49cf828c353f4c2c0916) how to cast votes [here](https://www.loom.com/share/2d0fbb5229f1427f9c01ed442c6373e7) and [here](https://www.loom.com/share/9547ed1a94fa44338db556af81c96732) to help explain the process if you have difficulties. \n\nYou may change or update your vote until voting officially closes.\n\n## Quorum\nMinimum of 60 votes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

It’s our vehicle to respond quickly to ongoing issues in web3 in a way that can untap a field of potential virality and exposure. This allows us to create the ‘pulse’ of web3 that we have always been discussing. This is a critical juncture for FF Labs where we can either invest and accelerate growth in the Labs community or we should decide to sunset this project entirely and redirect resources to other key Product initiatives. \n\n## Specifications\nTimeline: Remainder of Season 2\nResource allocation:\n- Interactive Designers: $1,500 USDC x 2 drops \n- Developers: $1500 USDC x 2 drops\n- Community rewards: $1000 USDC\n\nTotal: 7000 USDC\nDeliverables: \n- 2+ drops (experimental product releases)\n- Forming of new twitter community for FF Labs\n\n ## Quorum\n- Quorum: Minimum 5% of all currently circulating $FF (excluding treasury tokens) or 43119.2 $FF must participate for the proposal to pass.\n- Passing Threshold: 65% or more of voting members must vote YES for the proposal to pass.\n\n## Vote\nYes - Vote YES to approve funding for FF LABS\nNo - Vote NO to reject funding for FF LABS\n\n***\n*Value.

      "title": "Season 2 RETRO | Forefront Podcast Proposal",
      "content": "Title: FFIP-17: Forefront Retro Podcast Proposal\n\n## Sponsor\n\nSpaceXponential\n\n## Date of Proposal\n\nMay 24, 2022\n\n## Summary\n\nContinue Forefront podcast initiative (approved in Season 1), including Biweekly Roundups and existing community events content, such as Hangouts, Web3 Creator Residency, etc.\n\n## Motivation\n\nThe FF Pod aims to consistently release top-tier curation, analysis and commentary to build up Forefront brand awareness/equity and reputation. The Pod will serve as one element of our “Lighthouse” in our Community & Culture flywheel, whereby we attract new, culturally aligned members into our orbit - resulting in deeper network strength. \n\n## Duration\n\nIf approved, the FF Podcast Initiative will be funded through September 30, 2022. At that time, the Core Team will re-evaluate the Initiative and determine next steps.\n\n## Budget\n\nTo see the budget, please click [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1leAUisIfLHtwJBGeZN_jLfwtGC2Mwtbm9aB6TlNz1j8/edit).             \n\n## Description\n\n### Goals \n\nThe FF Podcast is a long-term play. Aggressive, short-term OKRs are not practical given budget constraints, but our general aims are as follows:\n\n1.  Continue creating high quality content and insights around social tokens, DAOs and Web3.\n2.  Build up audio content & podcasting as an effective distribution channel for Forefront content.\n3.  Generate brand awareness and equity.\n4.  Maintain or increase audience size. The latter will be reliant on increasing promotion/marketing, increasing content pipeline and experimenting with different formats (ie, guests). All of this, in turn, is dependent on budget constraints.\n\nThe Forefront Podcast has proven to be a successful, if smaller scale, project. The pod is nearing 10k total plays and has earned a fairly consistent audience from week to week. With increased time to build up an audience, seeking sponsorship revenue and other options for monetization become more likely.\n\nMost importantly, the bi-weekly Roundup has carved out a valuable niche for itself. The vast majority of Web3-related podcasts are either interview format or do a blow-by-blow news account of recent events. To our knowledge, the FF Roundup is the only news-focused pod with an explicit focus on contextualizing. The Roundup brings out the human dimensions of Web3, weaving in themes of philosophy, wellness, ethics, politics, etc. We think it’s important to create space for such content, now. As Web3 gains increasing traction, it will be essential for voices such as Forefront to exist in this space. The Pod is a foundation stone of Forefront’s aspiration to be a leading voice in Web3 culture.\n\n## Project Duration\n\nThe original proposal outlined the budget and deliverables for a “trial period” from August 31, 2021 to September 1, 2021.\n\nWith the passing of this current proposal, the initiative will continue to be funded through September 30, 2022; at that time, the Core Team will re-evaluate and determine next steps.  \n\n## Specifications\n\n### Deliverables\n\n*Weekly Hangouts*\n\nAudio from Forefront weekly Hangouts will be posted as podcast episodes using [Anchor.fm](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.google.com/url?q%3Dhttps://anchor.fm/dashboard%26amp;sa%3DD%26amp;source%3Deditors%26amp;ust%3D1653346358716082%26amp;usg%3DAOvVaw0CyMl-iCwbM2JdWIdTAwR5&sa=D&source=docs&ust=1653346358731226&usg=AOvVaw3n_u6Vk8193WLkT0i3G7ov) for publishing to push to all major podcast platforms (Apple Podcasts, Spotify, etc.). As applicable, recorded events and editorial from the Web3 Creator Residency and other community events will also be published to the feed, if it is possible to secure editing contributions. Leaving the format open to future experimentation (featuring guests; see budget) is key.\n\n*Biweekly Episodes*\n\nBiweekly (twice a month) episodes, inspired by the Bankless Weekly Rollup and MoFi Consensus, summarize the biggest news and trends in social tokens and DAOs in an easy-to-follow audio format. Each episode has two co-hosts and a duration of 60 to 90 minutes.\nBiweekly episodes and weekly hangouts will be published on the same feed. As before, the goal here is to allow Forefront to build up an audience of subscribers while we experiment with different types of audio content.\n\n### Timeline\n\n*Weekly Hangouts*\n\nWeekly Hangouts podcasts should be published every Wednesday, assuming the actual Hangout event occurs the previous Friday. The publication cadence may be modified according to the needs of the DAO or the team.\n\n*Biweekly Episodes*\n\nBiweekly episodes should be published every other Friday. The publication cadence may be modified according to the needs of the DAO or the team.\n\n…\n\n ## Quorum\n\n- Quorum: Minimum 5% of all currently circulating $FF (excluding treasury tokens) or 43119.2 $FF must participate for the proposal to pass.\n\n- Passing Threshold: 65% or more of voting members must vote YES for the proposal to pass.\n\n## Vote\n\nYes - Vote YES to approve continued funding for the Forefront Podcast through September 30, 2022, at which time the initiative shall be re-evaluated for further funding and governance by the Core Team.\n\nNo - Vote NO to reject continued funding for the Forefront Podcast.\n\n***\n*Value.

      "content": "## Author\npastacartel\n\n## Summary\nForefront has built an incredible reputation via accomplishments in S1 but web3 moves fast, and we must match pace if we want to continue being the leading discovery and reputation platform for tokenized communities. This proposal seeks to increase resources towards the following products:\n\n- **Terminal Directory**: building into the reputation platform for communities by providing a plug-and-play analytics dashboard made transparent to their community members. Many communities have already installed our discord bot to report on community metrics.\n- **Member Directory**: building into our reputation platform for members. We are exploring use-cases to have this become a marketplace of ideas (where members can find projects, and projects can find members).\n- **V2 Discovery Platform**: All our tools will merge into our main website - become a platform for discovery for all things surrounding tokenized communities.\n\n## Motivation\n\nForefront’s Product team is making exciting progress in 2022, however we need some extra resources to ensure the delivery of key products for the DAO by the end of Season 2. \n\nOur website is a foundation component of Forefront’s ecosystem and the team has been implementing incremental changes over the past two months. It is critical that we continue to build out its functionality and utility if we are to maintain our spot as the ‘reputation platform’ for all social tokens.\n\nOur DAO Terminal has garnered interest from across the industry. Our team will soon be shipping a version of this for IndexCoop. We have recently increased the scope/ambition of Terminal to now create a directory of Terminals that span the entire web3 social space.\n\nFinally, we are perhaps most bullish on our member directory, the immediate utility it will provide to DAOs, and the endless opportunities to build functionality on top of it.\n\nIt’s critical to establish our position in these three areas (Terminal Directory, Member Directory & finalize strategy for V2 Platform) within S2. \n\n## Specifications\n| Role                             \t| Allocation \t| WG      \t| Notes                                                                                                                     \t|   \t|\n|----------------------------------\t|------------\t|---------\t|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\t|---\t|\n| Design Support                   \t| 6k USD     \t| Product \t| Customization/Personalization support for Communities V2 Reputation Platform UX Support for one-off landing pages         \t|   \t|\n| Dev Support                      \t| 12k USD    \t| Product \t| Completion of Terminal and Squads Custom metrics/pages for Communities (on Terminal and Squads) Begin work on V2 Platform \t|   \t|\n| Total Requested for trial period \t| 18k USD    \t|         \t|                                                                                                                           \t|   \t|\n\n## Deliverables\nTo launch a Terminal Directory covering the most prominent social communities in web3 (early June)\nTo launch ‘Squads’, a web3 member directory supporting all communities on our marketplace (mid to late June)\nTo complete 80% UX for V2 Platform (July)\n\n### Project Duration\n2 months (taking us to the end of S2)\n\n ## Quorum\n- Quorum: Minimum 5% of all currently circulating $FF (excluding treasury tokens) or 43119.2 $FF must participate for the proposal to pass.\n- Passing Threshold: 65% or more of voting members must vote YES for the proposal to pass.\n\n## Vote\n- Yes - Vote YES to approve FFIP-17: Investing in Products: Terminal, Squads, & V2 Reputation Platform\n- No - Vote NO to reject FFIP-17: Investing in Products: Terminal, Squads, & V2 Reputation Platform\n\n***\n*Value.

      "content": "## Author\nQhawe\n\n## Summary\nThe Treasury team proposes swapping $25,000 of $FF with five of the leading social token communities. This will have multiple benefits for Forefront, including diversifying our treasury, aligning us with leading social token communities, and improving DAO2DAO relationships.\n\nThe Forefront Treasury working group has been in talks with Treasury teams of these communities. We are seeking to build a long-term alliance among the leading communities in the sector that should bring Forefront opportunities for years to come. This initial token swap is step one.\n\n## Motivation\nThis is an opportunity for Forefront to pioneer a D2D model with other leaders in the space. Participating communities include Bankless DAO, Krause House, Cabin, DAOHaus, and Yup. The following lists both immediate benefits and a few potential opportunities that could be spawned from such an alliance.\n\n### Benefits to Forefront ###\n- Treasury Diversification: We would diversify into 5 of the leading social token communities in one swap. Token swaps are particularly valuable in that no $FF would need to be sold on the open market (thus putting downward pressure on our token).\n- Forefront would be aligning ourselves financially with some of the leading social token communities. This should lead to greater collaborations and more opportunities for our community.\n- Forefront would establish metagovernance rights in the participating DAOs.\n- Forefront will benefit if any of the participating community’s tokens “moons”\n- Forefront would be pioneering a new form of multi-DAO Alliances.\n- Future opportunities for collaboration amongst Alliance partners may include joining lobbying efforts, contributor sharing, collateralized loans, liquidity solutions, a joint VC fund, and more.\n\n## Specifications\nForefront would send $25,000 to a multi-sig wallet (of which we would be a signer). In return, we would receive:\n\n$5,000 of $CABIN\n$5,000 of $KRAUSE\n$5,000 of $HAUS\n$5,000 of $YUP\n$5,000 of $BANK\n\nTokens would be subject to a minimum of a 3-year lock.\n\nFor more details, please reach out to our Treasury team.\n\n ## Quorum\n- Quorum: Minimum 5% of all currently circulating $FF (excluding treasury tokens) or 43119.2 $FF must participate for the proposal to pass.\n- Passing Threshold: 65% or more of voting members must vote YES for the proposal to pass.\n\n## Vote\nYes - Vote YES to approve FFIP-16: Social Token Alliance Swap\nNo - Vote NO to reject FFIP-16: Social Token Alliance Swap\n\n***\n*Value.

This follows on the diversification round from 3 months ago [(see Treasury Diversification Proposal 2022-1)](https://snapshot.org/#/ffdao.eth/proposal/0x0927dc97b0b2c4a725a8324695cca15bec244a3fbceed75df726489639187ca6).\n\n# Motivation #\n\n## Converting USDC to ETH ##\n\nDiversifying Forefront’s treasury remains a top priority in 2022. The first conservative step in this direction was to convert $150,000 (at the time, 8.7% of the USDC in Treasury) into ETH. That proposal was passed approximately 3 months ago on February 11, 2022.\n\nThe Treasury Working Group is now proposing converting an additional $150,000 USDC into ETH.\n\nForefront measures its operating budget “runway” in terms of Treasury USDC and ETH. This conversion would maintain an 18-month runway (at current expenditure levels) with a runway composition of approximately 5/6th USDC and 1/6th ETH.\n\nTreasury ownership of ETH provides multiple benefits including:\n\n- upside exposure to the larger value creation of Web3.\n- the ability to stake ETH and earn yield.\n- the ability to borrow against ETH.\n\nIn terms of market dynamics, the Treasury working group remains agnostic about future market conditions. We make no effort to predict the future, but rather to strategically diversify our treasury and position the DAO for long-term success.\n\n# Risks # \n\nThe price of ETH is volatile. This adds risk, both upside and downside, to our runway. For example, if ETH were to fall by 50% and stay there, it would decrease our operating runway by 1 month.\n\n# Success Conditions # \n\nSuccessfully swapping $150,000 of USDC to ETH.\n\n# Specification #\n\nTreasury Multi-Sig will execute both the swap and investment.\n\n# Costs #\n\nGas associated with trades. Costs are minimal.\n\n# Vote #\n\nYes - Vote Yes to approve Treasury Diversification Proposal 2022-2\nNo - Vote No to not approve Treasury Diversification Proposal 2022-1\n",

      "title": "FFIP-10: $SOCIAL GTM Budget",
      "content": "## Summary\n\nForefront and Index Coop are [launching $SOCIAL](https://gov.indexcoop.com/t/iip-120-dg-launch-forefront-social-token-index-social/4076), the world's first social token index. $SOCIAL will become one of Forefront's flagship products, accruing value to the DAO in multiple ways. This proposal requests funds to ensure that the launch is a success.\n\n## Motivation\n\n### The future of web3 is $SOCIAL\n\nTokenized communities use tokens to coordinate around the proliferation of a meme.\n\nThus, social tokens are an investment in culture.\n\nWeb3 enables communities to unlock value in unprecedented ways. People coming together to build, create, learn, curate, and vibe is valuable, and social tokens represent that value in increasingly rich ways.\n\nIn other words, tokenized communities are **platformless social networks**, and social tokens are the tool that enable these communities to coordinate and grow.\n\nThis is the future of digital communities.\n\n$SOCIAL is Forefront’s Social Token Index, launched in partnership with Index Coop. It is the first index that tracks the growth of the social token economy. \n\nWe believe that unparalleled value will accrue to these communities over the coming years as we continue to learn more about how web3 can unlock new forms of coordination, creation, and relationships.\n\nWhile DeFi protocols are innovating at the frontier of finance, tokenized communities are innovating at **the forefront of culture**. As the folks from Seed Club like to say, “tokens give communities superpowers,” and $SOCIAL captures those superpowers.\n\n## Value Proposition to Forefront\n\n### Revenue Generation\nForefront will receive a 0,78% streaming fee on assets under management. This could become a substantial revenue generator over time.\n \n### Branding\n​​Forefront’s name will be associated with the leading social token financial product in crypto.\n \nThe S&P, Dow Jones and DefiPulse all have great name recognition. Envision CNBC, Bankless and others referencing the Forefront $SOCIAL index.\n \n### Flagship Product\nThis will become one of our flagship projects. The go-to metric for anyone following the growth of the social token space. An easy-to-understand, industry-referenced metric that includes our name.\n \n### Metagovernance\nForefront will accumulate metagovernance voting power in other social token communities. This strengthens our ties with our social token partners in the space and also creates the potential for a metagovernance hub within Forefront’s discord.\n \n### Expand Our Audience\n$SOCIAL is unlike the typical social token product. It attracts a different type of crypto user - the investor. $SOCIAL’s success will bring a new audience into the Forefront ecosystem.\n \n### Future Investable Products\nThe successful launch of $SOCIAL will open the door for further products in the future.\n\n## Specifications\n\n### Goals\n- To launch the industry’s first social token index;\n- To create branding and marketing materials necessary for a successful product launch;\n- To leverage the creativity and talent of the Forefront community during $SOCIAL’s launch;\n- To be on track to attract AUM over $1.5M in the first 6 months;\n- To expand Forefront’s reach (followers, members, etc) by creating a DeFi friendly product that caters to a new audience.\n\n### Objectives and Key Results (OKRs)\n- $SOCIAL available on TokenSets and popular dexes (e.g Uniswap V3);\n- $SOCIAL generating revenue for the FF DAO, tracking $1.5M AUM in first 6 months;\n- Forefront accumulating Metagovernance voting power throughout the social token sector.\n\n### Deliverables\n- An investable product generating revenue for the DAO;\n- Professional graphics to include in $SOCIAL’s marketing campaign across various platforms (mirror articles, twitter posts, Forefront marketplace, etc);\n- Professional marketing materials;\n- Launch articles (mirror post, potential $SOCIAL manifesto);\n- A Social Media GTM plan - fully executed;\n- $SOCIAL capturing the top SEO result for “social token index”;\n- A list of bounties for the community to contribute to the product’s success;\n- The launch of the Forefront Metagovernance Council (FMC) along with a metagovernance channel in Discord.\n\n### Duration\n- 3-month initial launch period (one month prior, 2 months post launch);\n- Ultimately, the project would be ongoing.\n\n## Budget\nA total of $12,000 USDC is requested for the launch. The breakdown is as follows:\n- **Bounties:** $7500 (includes logo, articles, memes, merch, twitter threads, etc)\n- **Graphic Design Work:** $2500 (design work for articles, tweet threads, marketing materials, etc)\n- **Research/Analytics:** $2000 (Nansen, data analyst research, etc)\n\n## Quorum\n- Quorum: Minimum 5% of all currently circulating $FF (excluding treasury tokens) or 43119.2 $FF must participate for the proposal to pass.\n- Passing Threshold: 65% or more of voting members must vote YES for the proposal to pass.\n\n## Vote\nYes - Vote YES to approve $SOCIAL GTM Budget\nNo - Vote NO to reject $SOCIAL GTM Budget\n\n***\n*Value.

      "title": "FFIP-9: Forefront Season 2 Budget",
      "content": "# Summary\n\nForefront must continue to build a strong culture of transparency and community ownership, and changes in Seasons and major treasury spending is a significant part of that. We have embarked upon our second season, and to continue to uphold these values and grow as an organization we must ensure that the community approves the Season 2 budget proposal. The following proposal is a high-level breakdown of the season, its objectives, and the requested budget. A comprehensive breakdown of Forefront Season 2 may be found here. If the proposal does not pass, the core team will facilitate feedback collection to make necessary changes.\n\nIf approved, this will be retroactively applied as the proposed Season 2 starting date is March 14, 2022.\n\n# Motivation\n\n## Seasons\nA season is a bounded period of time where the Forefront community can align on projects and experiments that help us achieve our broader mission.\n\nWhile the grand vision for Forefront’s long-term future may differ for different community members, seasons allow us to build consensus around what high-level steps we are taking over a fixed period of time.\n\n## Season 2’s Primary Objectives\n\n- Develop an intentional \"A-Z\" Onboarding Program that activates and delights Contributors and Community Members.\n- Build out a Web3 media engine focused on research, deep storytelling, and curation for social tokenized communities, their development, their philosophy, and their use-cases.\n- Develop a collaborative product strategy to support social tokenized communities and solve key ecosystem problems (think DAO Terminal, FF Staking, etc…).\n\n# Specifications\nSeason 2 will retroactively begin on March 14th;\nSeason 2 will end on July 14;\nAggregate USDC budget is proposed to be: $64,400;\nAggregate $FF budget proposed is: 300,000 $FF.\n\n## Cost\nThe following funds are requested for Season 2. Contributor allocations will be a mix of USDC and $FF, depending upon role. The proposed budget allows us to maintain our 18-month USDC expenditure runway.\n\nUSDC Contributors: Max of $14,400;\nFF Contributors: Max of 250,000 $FF;\nUSDC Ecosystem Development: $50,000\n$FF Seasonal Projects: 50,000 $FF\n\nAt a token price of 1 $FF = 1.3 USDC this would equate to approximately 4.4% of the Treasuries $FF.\n\n## Contributor Allocation\nThe bulk of the proposed budget is allocated towards compensating high impact contributors. Forefront will seek to onboard ~20 contributors in the following capacities during Season 2:\n\n- Pioneers: Forefront is the Contributor’s sole work focus.\n- Oracles: Forefront is the Contributor’s primary, or top 2, work focus.\n- Alchemists: Forefront is a Contributor’s \"part-time\" commitment.\n- Voyagers: Forefront is a low-priority commitment for the Contributor.\n\n## Initial Working Groups\nThe aforementioned contributors will initially contribute to the following working groups:\n\n- Onboarding (DAO Contributor & Community)\n- Web3 Creator Residency\n- Community Programming\n- FF Journal & Museum\n- FF Daily\n- FF Newsletter & Wrapped\n- $SOCIAL\n- Metagovernance & D2D\n- FF Product Labs\n\n## Governance\nAny member of Forefront holding at least 100 $FF may submit a proposal for funding from the Seasonal Projects budget. The full governance framework is described here.\n\n# Conclusion\nForefront is seeking to build its “base layer” of high commitment contributors that position the DAO to realize its ambitious goals and objectives. This proposal provides the necessary funding to take this important first step.\n\n# Quorum\nQuorum: Minimum 5% of all currently circulating $FF (excluding treasury tokens) or 43119.2 $FF must participate for the proposal to pass.\nPassing Threshold: 65% or more of voting members must vote YES for the proposal to pass.\n\n# Vote\nYes - Vote YES to approve Forefront season 2 budget approval\nNo - Vote NO to reject Forefront season 2 budget approval\n\nValue.

      "content": "## Summary\nFollowing on the August 2021 [diversification round](https://snapshot.org/#/ffdao.eth/proposal/QmTqgWB7w372zStj45QkqZu6HtXP2NpzDamsoDAq8u25zV) that resulted in 2.1 million USDC in the treasury, we are proposing authorizing the Tokenomics Working group to take the following two actions:\n\n- Converting $150,000 of USDC to ETH.\n- Investing up to $500,000 of the USDC in Treasury into a low risk investment opportunity.\n\n## Motivation\n\n### Converting USDC to ETH\n\nDiversifying Forefront’s treasury is a top priority heading into 2022. The first conservative step in this direction is to convert $150,000 (approximately 8.7% of the USDC in Treasury) into ETH. The timing of the conversion is also somewhat fortuitous as ETH is down 30% over the past 30 days (as of Jan 30, 2022). Treasury ownership of ETH also provides upside exposure to the larger value creation of Web3.\n\n### Investing USDC\n\nThe USDC currently sitting in treasury is ‘unproductive’, meaning it is not earning any yield. We are proposing conservatively investing $500,000 of USDC into a low-risk interest-bearing investment opportunity. One example would be depositing the USDC into an Aave savings account (yielding 2.16% as of Jan 30, 2021). This would yield approximately $10,800 over the course of the year.\n\n## Success Conditions\nSuccessfully swapping $150,000 of USDC to ETH and investing $500,000 of USDC into a low-risk interest-bearing investment opportunity.\n\n## Specification\nTreasury Multi Sig will execute both the swap and investment.\n\n\n## Costs\nGas associated with trades. Costs are minimal.\n\n## Vote\nYes - Vote Yes to approve Treasury Diversification Proposal\nNo - Vote No to not approve Treasury Diversification Proposal\n\n***\n*Value. Culture. Community*",

      "title": "Forefront Public Goods Funding",
      "content": "Summary\n-------\nThis proposal is requesting $50,000 USDC from the Forefront Treasury for a Gitcoin-powered public goods initiative. Of this $50,000, $25,000 will be donated as matching funds to the Gitcoin Grants Round 12 Advocacy Round, which focuses on helping to fund advocacy organizations like Fight for the Future who sit at the intersection of tech and crypto activism.\n\nThe remaining $25,000 will be used as matching funds for a \"Forefront Side-Round,\" an opportunity for Forefront to fund key partners, organizations, and individuals within our community.\n\nMotivation\n----------\nFrom [Gitcoin](https://gitcoin.co/blog/gitcoin-grants-quadratic-funding-for-the-world/):\n\n\"Public goods create universally better outcomes for society. For those trapped in poverty, public goods are particularly essential, helping people meet basic needs. Public libraries for example --- assuming all else equal, can help educate the population indiscriminately (once again, this assumes the library offers truly equal opportunities to learn, and check out the resources needed).\n\nPublic Goods also serve those in privilege and power just as equally as those in poverty. We often don't notice it, but the majority of the value we consume in the world is public goods. After all, what value is your lambo to you if the sky is on fire? Funding Public Goods, ensuring they exist, and are accessible is often paramount to a society's advancement.\"\n\nForefront DAO is heavily dependent on public goods, from open source software to policy and research organizations pushing forward thinking and fighting for core principles of web3. Outside of the practical case, though, funding public goods is morally good. As the port of entry to web3, we have a responsibility to create and promote the culture that we want to see throughout the space. We should fund public goods because it is the right thing to do, and we should promote a culture that encourages the moral case rather than the practical one.\n\nAt the same time, Gitcoin's focus on Quadratic Funding is an exciting opportunity for Forefront to begin funding projects within our ecosystem to accelerate our progress as a DAO. The social token space is growing rapidly, and Forefront has the opportunity to establish itself as a critical pillar in the ecosystem.\n\nDetails\n-------\n### Advocacy Round\n\nThe Gitcoin Advocacy Round will be handled entirely by Gitcoin. Our only role will be funding ($25k) and promoting the round.\n\nForefront will be a matching partner. For more details on Gitcoin Grants, Quadratic Funding, and Matching Funds, please [give this article a read](https://gitcoin.co/blog/gitcoin-grants-quadratic-funding-for-the-world/). This is extremely important  to understand how Gitcoin works and what Forefront's role will be.\n\n### Forefront Side-Round\nIn addition to the Gitcoin Advocacy Round, Gitcoin will support Forefront's own Side-Round. This will be an opportunity for the Forefront community to select and support key projects, partners, and stakeholders within our ecosystem. The Side-Round will also use Quadratic Funding ($25k matching funds), so please read the article linked above for more clarity.\n\nWe propose that Forefront DAO appoints a Side-Round Committee to coordinate the logistics of the Side-Round and select the projects that will be included for funding.\n\nThe Committee should include:\n\n-   One Forefront Staff member.\n-   One Culture Guild member.\n-   One Growth Guild member.\n-   One Writers Guild member.\n\nEach Guild will be responsible for appointing a representative to the Side-Round Committee within three days of this proposal passing. The Committee will have full autonomy to develop a process to select projects for the Side-Round.\n\n## Vote\nYes - Vote Yes to approve Forefront Public Goods Funding Proposal\nNo - Vote No to not approve Forefront Public Goods Funding Proposal\n\n***\n\n*Value.

      "content": "Purpose\n-------\n\nApprove a Forefront Investment Club -- established through Syndicate Protocol -- to allow members of our community to collectively pool funds and invest in a simple and compliant way.\n\nA Forefront Investment Club would give community contributors the ability to leverage the Forefront brand to get into highly competitive web3 deals or access expensive assets that individuals generally could not reach.\n\nAlthough the Club would not directly return assets back to the Treasury (all returns would go back to investing members), token-gating the club accrues value back to the $FF token and incentivizes the Forefront community to support any portfolio companies and projects of the Club.\n\nOverview\n--------\nSyndicate Protocol will provide the tooling and requisite legal support to create an on-chain investment club, known as a Syndicate Investment Club. Clubs are groups of investors (no more than 99 individuals) pooling their own funds (no more than $20M total) to invest. Clubs can invest in both on-chain (NFTs, liquid tokens, etc.) and off-chain (startup equity, etc.) assets, and Syndicate's tools will automatically manage fundraising, cap table, and distributions for the Club.\n\nIn an investment club, there is no legal differentiation between members and managers -- thus, there is no carry or fees. The Club will appoint a manager to handle the technical aspects of the Club, ensure people are voting and send money, etc. However, from an investment perspective, all members hold equal voting weight and receive returns proportional to the amount of funds invested.\n\nClub Details\n------------\nClub Details:\n\n-   The Club will be open to Forefront contributors and core collaborators.\n-   After a 3 month trial period, the DAO may propose to open up the investment club to non-contributors (e.g. token-gating).\n-   Club administration (launch, technical support, etc.) will be managed by the Forefront Staff.\n\nLegal Limitations:\n\n-   The Club cannot hold more than $20M.\n-   The Club cannot have more than 99 members.\n-   Every member of the Club must actively participate in investment decisions (e.g. vote on each investment).\n-   The Club cannot receive funds from the DAO Treasury.\n-   The Club cannot distribute returns back to the DAO Treasury.\n\nBudget\n------\nSyndicate Protocol currently does not charge protocol fees. However, there are gas costs associated with creating an on-chain investment vehicle. While the gas costs are unpredictable, $1,000 is a decent ballpark. These funds will be paid out of the Forefront Treasury.\n\n## Vote\nYes - Vote Yes to approve Forefront Investment Club Proposal\nNo - Vote No to not approve Forefront Investment Club Proposal\n\n***\n\n*Value.

      "content": "## Summary\nThis proposal seeks to authorize FF Treasury to exchange 1,000,000 FF tokens for $2,000,000 USDC. \n\nA comprehensive timeline of discussion can be found on the [Governance forum](https://forum.forefront.news/d/23-ff-treasury-diversification-proposal).\n\n## Motivation\nForefront treasury is currently mainly composed of FF tokens (72% of total supply of $FF) and a small allocation of $ETH and $ROBOT tokens. Because 99% of the treasury is denominated by $FF, it remains highly unsustainable for the long-run development of the community.\n\nAs the Forefront DAO looks to expand its operations and onboard full time contributors, a diversified and sustainable treasury has become apparent. De-risking the treasury with more liquid and stable assets will allow us to fund operations and programs via USDC instead of FF tokens or exchanging $FF in the highly volatile open market which further alleviates the selling pressure on $FF.\n\nTo recap, along with posting the original proposal in the forum for an open discussion around the details and implications, we’ve hosted three separate hangouts on our discord with potential strategic partners and community members. Recordings of these hangouts are available on our discord and can be accessed by any community member.\n\n## Specification\nWe propose exchanging 1,000,000 FF tokens held in the DAO Treasury to strategic partners and community members for $2,000,000 USDC at a fully diluted network valuation (FDNV) of $20M, or 2 USDC per $FF.\n\nOf the total exchange amount, 80% will be allocated to strategic partners, while 20% will be reserved to community members.\n\n**All proceeds of this strategic round will go directly to the DAO Treasury.**\n\n### Strategic Partners\nForefront staff has negotiated the final allocation amount with strategic partners, which are composed of community focused funds, founders, and angels. Final list and allocation as follows:\n\n| Name  |Allocation (FF) | \n| --- | ------- | \n| Pet3rPan (1kx) | 400,000 |  \n| Linda Xie (Scalar Capital) | 125,000 | \n| Own.fund Collective | 75,000 | \n| MetaCartel Ventures | 75,000 | \n| DeFi Collective | 40,000 |\n| Brett Shear (Palm Tree Crew) | 12,500 | \n| Andy Chen Fang (Synthetix) | 12,500 | \n| Jenil (Coinvise) | 12,500 | \n| Kevin Chou (Rally) |  12,500 | \n| Jacob Horne (Zora) | 12,500 | \n| Samantha Yap (YAP Global) |  7,500 | \n| Anthony Sassano (EthHub) |  7,500 | \n| Jesse Grushak |  7,500 | \n| **Total** |  **800,000 FF** | \n\n*Full list [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FcWOzbA_12_UbS5M6EHbAB4AcqYPkCB-B0derRljIxc/edit?usp=sharing)* \n\nFF tokens acquired via strategic partners round will be subject to a **12 month cliff, plus an additional 12 month linear monthly unlock after the cliff.**\n\n### Community Round\nAs discussed in both the original and revised proposal, 20% of the round (200,000 FF) will be reserved for the community, prioritizing Forefront contributors as defined by Season One guidelines.\n\nForefront staff will be sending out an Interest Form in waves. This form will be timeboxed, and in line with the following criteria:\n\n- **Wave 1:** Current Contributors and Collaborators\n“Contributor” will be formally defined based on the Season 1 definition. If you are an official member of a Guild and have gone through the onboarding flow, you are a contributor.\n- **Wave 2:** Past Contributors, NFT Holders, Merch Holders, Sourcecred Users, Snapshot Voters, Speakers\nHere, contributor is loosely defined to mean anyone who has completed an FF bounty, been a Hangout guest, or any other meaningful contribution to the community. NFT holders (Genesis NFT) and Metafactory Merch Holders are also included in this wave.\n- **Wave 3:** Forefront Community Members\nIf you are not a member of the above waves, Forefront members will still have access to the Community Allocation in a third and final wave. \n\nThe maximum individual community allocation will be $10,000USDC (min $1,000USDC). **If the round is not filled by Wave 3, the remaining Community Allocation will be rolled over to Strategic Partners. The Community Allocation period will last only 72 hours.**\n\nThe official dates will be announced after the Snapshot vote (assuming community approval).\n\nTokens acquired via Community Round are not subject to vesting.\n\n## Vote\nYes - Vote YES to approve the exchange\nNo - Vote NO to not approve the exchange \n\n***\n*Value.

Our hope is that Season One will be a step forward in strengthening Forefront's position as the leader of the social token space while also building strong relationships with existing and upcoming communities.\n\n## Specification\n- Bring FF Season One to Forefront;\n- If passed, FF Season one will run for a period of 90 days, starting July 19th;\n- Introduce Guilds, contributor types, and new governance process.\n- Approve a max allocation of 450,000 $FF for Season One expenses (150,000 $FF for core operations expenses and 100,000 $FF allocation for each guild). Payout allocation will run monthly and/or per-project basis.\n\n## Vote\nYes - Vote Yes to bring FF Season One to Forefront\nNo - Vote No to not bring FF Season One to Forefront\n\n***\n*Value. Culture. Community*\n\n",
