      "content": "# Authors\n@desnakeee\n\n# Summary\nThis proposal asks DAO permission to lower WBTC & WETH Pools' IRM parameters and lower minimal & maximal quota rates of all LRTs and Ethena tokens allowed as collateral.\n\n# Motivation\nFor all the referenced numbers please see [rates comparison dashboard](https://dune.com/desnakeee/borrowing-cost-comparison).\n\nImplied rates for BTC LRTs on Pendle have stabilized at around 7% APR. Similar strategies on other money markets offer even lower rates. However, Gearbox WBTC pool's IRM reaches those average market borrowing rates at 60-70% utilization, leaving pool underutilized. The aim of lowering IRM rates is to shift utilization corresponding to demanded rates to ~80%. Under nonzero quota rates utilization will realistically stay at 75-85%.\n\nFor more than 4 months rates for borrowing against ETH LRTs  remained below 15%, averaging around 5% in recent months. Rates for borrowing against USDe/sUSDe & implied rates on Pendle also stay below 15% for more than 3 months.\nIn contrast, the maxRate in Gearbox gauges is set at 30% for all LRTs and 50% for USDe/sUSDe. This disparity makes it more efficient to vote for increasing rates than to vote against them, causing rates to deviate upwards from market average and complicating the gauge voting process.\n\n# Technical specification\n# Trade WBTC v3 pool\n## New IRM parameters\n| Parameter | Proposed value |\n| --------- | -------------- |\n| r0        | 0              |\n| r1        | 1           |\n| r2        | 1.5           |\n| r3        | 60             |\n| U1        | 70             |\n| U2        | 90             |\n| isBorrowingMoreU2Forbidden        | true             |\n\nDeploy new IRM and set it to be used by Trade WBTC V3 Pool on Mainnet.\n\n| Utilization, % | Base borrow rate (current IRM) | Base borrow rate (proposed IRM) |\n| -------------- | ------------------------------ | ------------------------------- |\n| 70             | 2.50                           | 1.25                           |\n| 80             | 4.06                           | 2.19                            |\n| 90             | 5.63                           | 3.13                            |\n## Quota rate bounds\n| Token | minRate, % | maxRate, % |\n| -------------- | ------------------------------ | ------------------------------- |\n| LBTC             | 0.05                           | 15                           |\n\n# Trade WETH v3 pool\n## New IRM parameters\n| Parameter | Proposed value |\n| --------- | -------------- |\n| r0        | 0              |\n| r1        | 1           |\n| r2        | 1.5           |\n| r3        | 60             |\n| U1        | 70             |\n| U2        | 90             |\n| isBorrowingMoreU2Forbidden        | true             |\n\nDeploy new IRM and set it to be used by Trade WETH V3 Pool on Mainnet.\n\n| Utilization, % | Base borrow rate (current IRM) | Base borrow rate (proposed IRM) |\n| -------------- | ------------------------------ | ------------------------------- |\n| 70             | 2.50                           | 1.25                           |\n| 80             | 4.06                           | 2.19                            |\n| 90             | 5.63                           | 3.13                            |\n## Quota rate bounds\n| Token | minRate, % | maxRate, % |\n| -------------- | ------------------------------ | ------------------------------- |\n| pzETH| 0.05| 10|\n| Re7LRT| 0.05| 10|\n| amphrETH| 0.05| 10|\n| steakLRT| 0.05| 10|\n| rstETH| 0.05| 10|\n| weETH| 0.05| 10|\n| ezETH| 0.05| 10|\n| rsETH| 0.05| 10|\n| pufETH| 0.05| 10|\n| rswETH| 0.05| 10|\n\n\n# Trade USDC v3 pool\n## Quota rate bounds\n| Token | minRate, % | maxRate, % |\n| -------------- | ------------------------------ | ------------------------------- |\n| USDe| 0.05| 25|\n| sUSDe| 0.05| 25|\n\n# Universal USDT v3 pool\n## Quota rate bounds\n| Token | minRate, % | maxRate, % |\n| -------------- | ------------------------------ | ------------------------------- |\n| USDe| 0.05| 25|\n| sUSDe| 0.05| 25|\n\n# DAI v3 pool\n## Quota rate bounds\n| Token | minRate, % | maxRate, % |\n| -------------- | ------------------------------ | ------------------------------- |\n| USDe| 0.05| 25|\n| sUSDe| 0.05| 25|\n\n# GHO v3 pool\n## Quota rate bounds\n| Token | minRate, % | maxRate, % |\n| -------------- | ------------------------------ | ------------------------------- |\n| USDe| 0.05| 25|\n| sUSDe| 0.05| 25|\n\n# crvUSD v3 pool\n## Quota rate bounds\n| Token | minRate, % | maxRate, % |\n| -------------- | ------------------------------ | ------------------------------- |\n| USDe| 0.05| 25|\n| sUSDe| 0.05| 25|\n\n# Transactions details\nTxs log can be found [here](https://gearboxprotocol.notion.site/GIP-170-dee6f3e696db4ff199d907955960e6fa?pvs=4).

      "content": "## Summary\n\nThis proposal aims to request funds from the DAO in the size of 15000 USDC, in order to pay for an audit of new integrations. The audit will be conducted by Decurity and Watchpug over the span of 1 week. \nGearbox has always placed security front and center. Smart contract auditing is critical to ensuring the safety of user funds and it is also critical to building trust with users, so allocating a budget for auditing new integrations and updates seems reasonable. \n## Audit scope\nThis is a limited-scope audit that reviews integrations as discussed between Gearbox contributors and Decurity / Watchpug. \n\nThe following adapter / price feed contracts are reviewed by Decurity:\n- https://github.com/Gearbox-protocol/integrations-v3/blob/sky-adapters-3_0/contracts/adapters/sky/DaiUsdsAdapter.sol\n- https://github.com/Gearbox-protocol/integrations-v3/blob/sky-adapters-3_0/contracts/adapters/sky/StakingRewardsAdapter.sol\n- https://github.com/Gearbox-protocol/integrations-v3/blob/sky-adapters-3_0/contracts/helpers/sky/StakingRewardsPhantomToken.sol\n- https://github.com/Gearbox-protocol/integrations-v3/blob/sky-adapters/contracts/adapters/sky/DaiUsdsAdapter.sol\n- https://github.com/Gearbox-protocol/integrations-v3/blob/sky-adapters/contracts/adapters/sky/StakingRewardsAdapter.sol\n- https://github.com/Gearbox-protocol/integrations-v3/blob/sky-adapters/contracts/helpers/sky/StakingRewardsPhantomToken.sol\n- https://github.com/Gearbox-protocol/oracles-v3/blob/next/contracts/oracles/updatable/PythPriceFeed.sol\n\nThe following price feed contracts are reviewed by Watchpug:\n- https://github.com/Gearbox-protocol/oracles-v3/blob/pendle-pt-pf-3_1/contracts/oracles/pendle/PendleTWAPPTPriceFeed.sol\n- https://github.com/Gearbox-protocol/oracles-v3/blob/pendle-pt-price-feed/contracts/oracles/pendle/PendleTWAPPTPriceFeed.sol\n\n## Budget Breakdown\nThe total budget for final review includes 15000 USDC payment (10 000 USDC for Decurity audit and 3000 USDC for Watchpug audit, and 2000 USDC is proposed to be reserved as an extra if required). Post-audit, the community can expect a detailed audit report, highlighting any vulnerabilities found and their severity. Like it was always done before (https://docs.gearbox.finance/risk-and-security/audits-bug-bounty).\n\n### About Decurity\nDecurity is a team of veteran hackers who dived into the blockchain and smart contract security in the early days. Top-2 in @Paradigm and @OpenZeppelin CTF, previously audited Gearbox, 1inch, yearn, compound and other protocols (check here for details). \n\n### About Watchpug\nWatchpug is a security team that collaborates with protocol developers, offering practical security knowledge and in-depth auditing for Solidity smart contracts. Previously did several audits of Pendle (check here and here).",

      "content": "Authorising the Gearbox Foundation to enter into an agreement with Crystal Blockchain B.V. and/or associated entities.\n\n#### Motivation:\nWith the growth of Gearbox Protocol and the increase in the number of users, along with recent trends in cryptocurrency industry regulation, it is advisable to implement additional wallet checks for users of Gearbox Protocol. The services may include, among other things, wallet checks, transaction monitoring, etc.\n\nA reputable solution on the market is Crystal's solution (https://crystalintelligence.com).\n\nThe cost of this service under the agreement is $30,000 per year (100,000 checks per year), with an additional cost for exceeding the annual check limit.\n\nThe estimated number of wallet checks per year is 100,000, but this number is not final and will depend on various factors.\n\nTherefore, we request that GEAR DAO approve a budget reservation of $30,000 for the first year of the agreement with Crystal Blockchain B.V. and/or associated entities. Additionally, GEAR DAO approves the terms of the agreement for additional payments if the number of checks exceeds 100,000 in one year. The additional cost under the agreement for exceeding the annual check limit may range from $6,000 to $75,000 (depending on the number of extra checks).\n\n#### Funds Management:\nThe funds will be disbursed from the Gearbox Foundation wallet. Therefore, prior to signing the agreement, GEAR DAO will transfer $30,000 to the Gearbox Foundation wallet, enabling the Foundation to make the payment under the agreement. Additionally, if there is a need to purchase an additional check package during the year, GEAR DAO will, after receiving a notification from the Foundation (via Discord, Telegram, email, or other communication channels), transfer the necessary additional funds (ranging from $6,000 to $75,000) to the Gearbox Foundation wallet.\n\nAdditionally, this resolution authorizes the Gearbox Foundation to extend the agreement for the second year if the Foundation deems it appropriate. The price for the second year may increase by up to 10%.\n\nBy adopting this resolution, the Gearbox Foundation has the authority to make agreements, take actions, and enter into transactions as they see fit to carry out the decisions made here, as long as it makes sense and is appropriate in the circumstances.",

      "content": "## Summary\n\nThe OBRA framework, which stands for Outcomes-Based Resource Allocation, was implemented by Gearbox DAO in February 2023 and has performed well so far. This proposal aims to extend and refine the framework, as well as set the budgets for the upcoming cycles. You can view the initial vote and details [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20230207155819/https://gov.gearbox.fi/t/gip-43-obra-dao-governance-framework-cycle-1-feb-april/2303/) (archived on the Wayback Machine since discussions moved to Discord afterward).\n\n## Motivation\n\nGearbox Protocol has grown to over 15 contributors, with more than 70% being developers, and has established several ongoing processes, including collateral onboarding, security monitoring, marketing efforts, development, and events. To scale more efficiently, there are two options: either implement a hierarchical structure (similar to traditional companies with top-down leadership) or attempt to parallelize processes, making them decentralized.\n\nSince processes like development, deployment, and collateral onboarding don’t need to be synchronized, a leadership overhang is unnecessary. There is no one leader or one group leader.\n\nThat is what OBRA aims to achieve.\n\n## Specification\n\n### General Initiatives Framework\n\nGiven the transparent nature of DAOs, the OBRA framework was identified as a better fit in 2023, and it has operated smoothly so far. It is now prudent to solidify its scope and extend its use. By organizing contributors into initiatives rather than fixed roles, various tasks can be carried out in parallel without relying on centralized planning.\n\nThink of it as a foundation that issues grants for various initiatives—research, marketing, events, community support, etc.—none of which depend on each other or a central authority. There is no concept of a central boss or CEO. Anyone can join an initiative, create one, secure a budget, and try to run it. But how do we ensure that funds are not misused? This is where the OBRA framework, outcomes-based resource allocation, comes in:\n\n- Align on Vision and Goals: Not to centralize planning, but to decide on budget allocations through the OBRA vote.\n- Open Forum for Initiatives: Allow anyone to propose new initiatives or replace existing ones, with approval by DAO vote.\n- Cycle-Based Funding: Split deliverables into quarterly cycles and fund them accordingly.\n\nIf the work is completed, the initiative continues. If the work is not done or is unsatisfactory, the DAO can vote to discontinue the initiative. In the worst-case scenario, the DAO incurs no big loss, as it only funds initiatives in tranches, not a year in advance.\n\nThis structure eliminates the need for a central boss or leadership, avoiding the pitfalls of centralized company models, which DAOs do not. Instead, it operates with multiple concurrent grants and grantees and periodic grant installments.\n\nSome of the details can be found in Notion, explaining different initiatives and their members. [See in Notion](https://gearboxprotocol.notion.site/Gearbox-DAO-23966f122ae4421492819242b30a0e7a?pvs=4).\n\n### Initiative Budgets\n\nEach initiative functions independently. It can consist of one person or multiple people. They manage their budgets as they see fit while being accountable and transparent about their financials. It’s up to the initiative members to decide who gets paid and how much. This approach allows developers to determine audit budgets independently by themselves.\n\n### Initiative Bonuses\n\nNot all initiatives require bonuses. For one-off service provider grants, bonuses are usually outside the scope but can be considered on a case-by-case basis.\nDuring a test period (3 months), no bonuses are awarded. However, if a contributor remains within an initiative beyond the test period, they can receive the bonus retroactively according to the chosen schedule. This ensures there’s no downside for contributors who stay on board.\n\n#### New Contributors Bonuses\n\n- Option 1: Receive tokens per month based on a 0.5x ratio with USD compensation. The $150M FDV benchmark remains intact. Vesting terms include a 3-month lock followed by 12 months of linear vesting, similar to the current arrangements.\n\n- Option 2: Opt for a 1x token multiplier at a $150M FDV, with no liquidity until +12 months after the start. At that point, a 12-month linear vesting period will commence starting from that date, so 12+18. This option requires a full year of committed contributions before vesting begins, offering a larger reward in exchange for delayed liquidity. If you choose to leave early or fail to meet performance expectations and are laid off, the bonus is reduced to a pro-rata amount, with a multiplier of 0.3x instead.\n\n#### Old Contributors Bonuses\n\nOld Contributors is every initiative member onboarded before the start of 2024. That means, everyone in the table mentioned except Arkhip, Petr, QADaria, and Ilya desnake. They have been onboarded in 2024. Every new member onboarded also only qualifies for New Bonuses structure.\n\n- Option 1: Receive tokens per month based on a 1x ratio with USD compensation. The $150M FDV benchmark remains intact. Vesting terms include a 3-month lock followed by 12 months of linear vesting.\n\n- Option 2: Opt for a 2x token multiplier at a $150M FDV, with no liquidity until +12 months after the start. At that point, a 18-month linear vesting period will commence starting from that date, so 12+18. This option requires a full year of committed contributions before vesting begins, offering a larger reward in exchange for delayed liquidity. If you choose to leave early or fail to meet performance expectations and are laid off, the bonus is reduced to a pro-rata amount, with a multiplier of 0.4x instead.\n\nThe 1.25x bonus option will not exist anymore starting with the new 2025 period. [GIP-89](https://snapshot.org/#/gearbox.eth/proposal/0x10abcdb8bafc98aa154d6690d65a5ec864888fb9d39614bfd5480de1013304b3) is what is being referenced on the previous changes.\n\n### DAO Goals\n\nThe general DAO goals can be discussed extensively. For the sake of the proposal, one could abstract them into these concrete goals:\n\nMaintaining the current protocol and products:\n- Monitoring tools and upkeeping security practices;\n- Interface development and improvement;\n-  Listing new collaterals and adjusting limits;\n- Backend and infrastructure tools;\nImproving the protocol and adding new features to it:\n- Developing new adapters and core protocol improvements.\nIncreasing the brand recognition and user base:\n- Community support and activities;\n- Cross-community marketing and content creation;\n- Online and offline marketing;\n- High-level BD and institutional relationships.\nLegal and operational:\n- Legal framework and support;\n- Grants operations maintenance.\n\n### New Cycle Initiative Budgets\n \n![Screenshot 2024-09-27 at 8.53.13 PM.png](ipfs://bafkreibu3bsjwszolupczputlkcaf5gcddwpi5iuz3a5rbhsxy2g5cvwzm)\n\nThe budgets are tentative, based on the current and approximate forward-looking expenses.\n\nIn addition to the above, the Foundation can also perform activities and tap into budgets where applicable, for example, [GIP-138](https://snapshot.org/#/gearbox.eth/proposal/0xc07eb03d24fd7baa7fd5b8fb98f4d356c19f76c2551985255421c08a88ac8c36). That GIP also clarifies the budget for Chaos Labs, which has a floating rate and is explained in detail in there. Overall, GIP-138 stays intact.\n\nInfrastructure Grant GIP-84 is now mostly done via the GEAR DAO since it is real-world services spending. Crystal is referring to a KYC-AML solution that the Foundation advised to have, its costs are factored into the Legal and E-Services too. Nerd Labs in this context includes Rising Vista FZE LLC and a couple of other contributors under it. The exact spending and the multipliers for each initiative are communicated often in monthly transaction reports. VIBES budgets vary on separate votes, no pre-made budget as such.\n\nYou can see that each initiative has a budget comprised of compensations per contributor. The concrete compensations are available on Notion and can be also tracked onchain via recurring installments. There is a surplus in each initiative that the members can utilize to adjust compensations without having to redo a vote fully, based on the opinion of an initiative leader (if one exists). This way, small expenditures on initiative-related matters can be executed. It can also be spent on HR, for example, if such is needed to scale an initiative.\n\n### Reporting and Addresses\n\nMonthly spending reports are posted on Notion and can be accessed [here](https://gearboxprotocol.notion.site/Monthly-Reports-6849871a9bae44dfb903531c0a997e8f). The addresses for each initiative are managed independently by the members within those initiatives.\n\nThis also applies to other data, such as a notification about the token payment scheme chosen by the contributors (coefficients from option 1 or 2 and their values).\n\n### Future Considerations\n\nThe proposal, along with the responsibilities and risk limits of initiatives, could be further enhanced by establishing a formal DAO constitution, similar to the one set up by ENS DAO. This would further solidify the framework and make processes even more transparent and accountable. DAOBOX Inc. is equipped to make it possible and manage those legal matters.\n\n## The Authority of the Gearbox Foundation\n\nBy this resolution, the DAO confirms that the Gearbox Foundation has the authority to make agreements, take actions, and enter into transactions as they see fit to carry out the decisions made here, as long as it makes sense and is appropriate in the circumstances. \n\n## Next steps and timelock\n\nIf this framework is approved, the changes will be implemented immediately. Since this proposal was for discussion for an entire month, this is not a new topic. If approved, it will reflect September compensations already. If not, discussions will continue to refine the proposal.",

      "content": "# Authors\ndesnakeee.eth\n\n# Summary\nThis proposal aims to attach wstETH market oracle as reserve to Mellow LRTs & allow direct deposits to Mellow via the new adapter.\n\n# Motivation\nMellow LRTs experienced remarkable adoption on Gearbox, reaching full quota capacity in under 2 days. However, liquidity levels for these assets remain relatively low, rendering full liquidations of particularly large Credit Accounts unfeasible. Implementing a reserve oracle will enable partial liquidations, mitigating potential risks for the protocol.\n\nAnother problem caused by the liquidity profile is price impact on opening and closing positions. To mitigate this, it's proposed to add an adapter allowing direct deposits to Mellow vaults, which will eliminate slippage on position openings. This adapter has undergone Decurity [audit](https://github.com/Gearbox-protocol/security/blob/main/audits/2024%20Aug%20-%20Decurity_Gearbox_Pendle_Mellow.pdf) .\n\n# Technical specification\nSet reserve oracles for rstETH, steakLRT, Re7LRT, amphrETH, pzETH to be wstETH fundamental oracle (wstETH/stETH exchange rate * ETH price).\nDeploy and connect Mellow deposit adapter to Restaking WETH Credit Manager.\n\n# Transaction log\nTxs log can be found [here](https://gearboxprotocol.notion.site/GIP-165-062d2bd8c18f4667b03131e6df919e23?pvs=4)\nMd5 checksum is d63f63c751ee2c134c3d628426e3a934",

Should the community seek to mitigate exposure to Mellow, it may be prudent to consider the implementation of more conservative supply and borrow caps.*\n\n### **Analysis**\n\n**What is RE7LRT?**\n\nRe7LRT is a Mellow vault token curated by RE7 Capital, with over 12,000 wstETH currently constituting its underlying asset. Alongside amphrETH, rstETH, wstETH, and steakLRT, it offers users targeted exposure to the Symbiotic restaking infrastructure. For more details, please refer to the Gearbox Blog Post.\n\nRE7LRT currently holds a total on-chain liquidity of 797 ETH in the Balancer Pool, which it shares with the aforementioned LRTs. Chaos Labs proposes setting the quota limit to 7,000, in line with other Mellow LRTs limits increase in [GIP-163](https://discord.com/channels/841203475606011905/1277697936750280946).  The recommendation comes after taking the rapid growth of RE7LRT along with the limited bad debt risk profile of its fundamental oracle along with withdrawals enabled.\n\n## Recommendation\n| **Parameter**             | **Value**      |\n| ------------------------- | -------------- |\n| **Asset**                 | **RE7LRT**     |\n| **Chain**                 | Ethereum       |\n| **Credit Manager**        | Restaking WETH |\n| **Quota Limit**           | 7000            |\n| **minRate**               | .5%            |\n| **maxRate**               | 30%            |\n| **Liquidation Threshold** | 0.90           |\n**Main oracle:** fundamental Mellow price feed adapter.\n\n## Transaction log\nTxs log can be found [here](https://gearboxprotocol.notion.site/GIP-162-3b744374ec4a4b02ac04a82dfcd87e89?pvs=4)\nMd5 checksum is 86fc017aeda088c07dc3f1975747cc52.",

      "title": "[GIP-161] Onboard LBTC on Ethereum",
      "content": "## Author\nChaos Labs\n\n## **Overview**\n\nChaos Labs proposes listing LBTC on the Gearbox WBTC with conservative quota limits and LT parameter of 35 BTC and 90%.\n\nHaving launched on August 21st, with the corresponding Babylon protocol set to follow on August 22nd, LBTC is currently in private beta. Waitlist members are being gradually issued access codes to deposit BTC and mint LBTC in batches over the coming days. At time of writing, there have been 191 LBTC minted by 32 different users, resulting in a TVL of approx. $11,606,884. \n\n*Note: The following recommendation is based exclusively on market risk considerations, deliberately excluding centralization and third-party risk factors. Should the community seek to mitigate exposure to Lombard, it may be prudent to consider the implementation of more conservative supply and borrow caps.  We provide a brief commentary on these factors.*\n\n**Missing Rewards** \n\nLBTC's success is closely tied to the performance of the Babylon protocol. However, the Babylon protocol will be rolled out in multiple phases. In the first phase, up to 1000 BTC can be deposited into the protocol, but the Babylon Proof-of-Stake (PoS) chain has not yet launched, meaning staking will not be available until the next phase. The timing for this subsequent phase has not been communicated, leaving LBTC without any reward streams in the foreseeable future. Although the Babylon protocol is distributing points during this interim period, these points are allocated to depositors through the Lombard Finance protocol, not to LBTC holders. This lack of yield could potentially dampen demand and trading activities for LBTC in its early stages.\n\n**Collateral & LBTC Supply**\n\nBabylon employs a first-come, first-served methodology, making it uncertain how much of the BTC deposited on Lombard Finance will ultimately be staked on Babylon. If Babylon's initial cap of 1,000 BTC is reached, Lombard Finance will continue accepting BTC deposits and minting LBTC. Deposits will be held in users' SegWit addresses, which are managed via CubeSigner. These addresses have access controls, permitting transactions only with Babylon and requiring multi-party approval (MPA) by a committee. However, the identities of the committee members have not been disclosed. \n\nWe find this information relevant, as it seems that a substantial portion of the LBTC collateral will remain in these deposit addresses rather than being moved to the Babylon protocol until the cap is lifted. An initial survey of the Discord community also suggests that the first-come, first-served approach is causing users to hesitate about depositing into Lombard, potentially further restricting the LBTC supply.\n\n**Liquidity**\n\nAs for liquidity, both the Curve as well as the Uniswap pool have increase their liquidty, with Uniswap holding $950k (15.60 BTC) and Curve $100k (1.72 BTC). Which we see as a positive sign for LBTC adoption going forward. \n![image](ipfs://bafkreifh2mzezu6izkjzclgqlk7m23qds2krm7chbmr2x3udqkixtjhcii)\n     \n![image](ipfs://bafkreihc32mbqubnrpnx7jcedgcwe7pgqtdto7p5y7yuxre35vas27jqna)\n    \n### Recommendation\n\nSince LBTC is still in an early stage, we recommend listing LBTC within the WBTC market with a low limit quota at this stage given the low liquidity and our projected forward-looking price volatility with respect to its peg. As liquidity increases over the coming days and weeks, we will monitor the token and quota to assess for quota increases.\n\nFrom a trust assumption point of view, we would also feel more comfortable should more information to Committee members regarding those who control the user deposit addresses be disclosed.  We also await the date for the cap lift from the Babylon side. \n\n### Specification\n| **Parameter**             | **Value**                                                                                                                                                    |\n| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| **Asset**                 | LBTC                                                                                                                                                         |\n| **Chain**                 | Ethereum                                                                                                                                                     |\n| **Credit Manager**        | WBTC Tier 1  Credit manager                                                                                                                                          |\n| **Quota Limit**           | 35                                                                                                                                                           |\n| **minRate**               | .5%                                                                                                                                                          |\n| **maxRate**               | 30%                                                                                                                                                          |\n| **Liquidation Threshold** | 90%                                                                                                                                                          |\n| Trade Adaptors            | UniV3: 0x87428a53e14d24Ab19c6Ca4939B4df93B8996cA9 and Curve: 0xf130e387e2083ee79f3588e678c9b446a07860cb                                            |\n| Oracle                    | Redstone: [https://etherscan.io/address/0xb415eAA355D8440ac7eCB602D3fb67ccC1f0bc81](https://etherscan.io/address/0xb415eAA355D8440ac7eCB602D3fb67ccC1f0bc81) |\n\n# Transaction log\nTxs log can be found [here](https://gearboxprotocol.notion.site/GIP-161-b05016bc8b6b4e08805585b97377a50f?pvs=4)\nMd5 checksum is 28bc7c7ce856f89d98e605ce257d0c1c",

      "title": "[GIP-154] Hardcode stETH Oracle to ETH",
      "content": "# Author\nChaos Labs\n\n# Summary\n\nChaos Labs provides a recommendation to implement a fundamental oracle for stETH and wstETH on all deployments.\n\n# Analysis\n\n## Current Oracle Implementation in DeFi\n\nFundamental oracles are critical in ensuring an accurate and non-manipulative continuous valuation of correlated assets. They are defined and enabled through withdrawal mechanisms that enable users to retrieve their underlying assets, thereby implicitly achieving market price convergence with the fundamental value. Currently, the practice of hardcoding stETH to ETH mirrors the underlying practices seen on Aave for all sound correlated assets, whereby the underlying wstETH/stETH exchange rate, or the function `getPooledEthByShares`, effectively represents the total accrued balance realized from consensus and execution layer rewards over time, through the form of rebasing events. In the [Aave wstETH price oracle contract](https://etherscan.io/address/0xB4aB0c94159bc2d8C133946E7241368fc2F2a010#readContract), this “fundamental oracle” approach is clearly demonstrated.\n\nOn Aave, unlike Gearbox, collateral assets are supplied as liquidity, making them available for borrowing. This mechanism necessitates the use of wstETH instead of the rebasing stETH on Ethereum as the underlying asset, given the complexities found through potential manipulation events through deterministic rebase extraction. The reason for this is that wstETH represents a non-rebasing, wrapped version of stETH, providing a stable and predictable value necessary for borrowing and lending operations.\n\n## Lido stETH / ETH Accounting\n\nWhen a Lido oracle report occurs, the token supply is adjusted algorithmically based on various factors. These include staking rewards or slashing penalties on the Beacon Chain, execution layer rewards, and fulfilled withdrawal requests. A rebase takes place when the oracle reports the beacon statistics.\n\nIn the event of a significant slashing event, the Lido protocol can activate a \"bunker mode,\" whereby withdrawal requests are temporarily paused until the negative consequences of the event are fully resolved. This measure leverages a socializing principle and is designed to prevent sophisticated users from taking advantage of the situation by exiting the network prematurely during adverse conditions.\n\nAs a result, during a negative Consensus Layer rebase event or an instance where there is an extreme mass slashing event or an anticipated mass slashing event involving a significant number of validators, the underlying totalPooledEther will be discounted accordingly. This discounting effectively socializes the realized loss among current stETH holders by decreasing the relative number of stETH tokens in circulation to match the new underlying totalPooledEther value.\n\nIn such scenarios, the total amount of ETH backing stETH decreases, leading to a proportional reduction in the number of stETH tokens in circulation. This ensures that stETH continues to represent the underlying ETH it backs, maintaining its fundamental value while reducing its quantity pro-rata to reflect the loss. This mechanism ensures that all holders share the impact of the negative event equally, preventing any single participant from bearing the entire burden.\n\nFor wstETH, the wrapped version of stETH, this adjustment will result in a decrease in the underlying wstETH/stETH ratio. The ratio adjustment reflects the socialized loss realized by the network, thereby acting as a fundamental oracle. The decrease in the wstETH/stETH ratio corresponds directly to the reduction in the totalPooledEther value, ensuring that wstETH continues to represent its share of the underlying stETH accurately.\n\n## Potential Risks of Hardcoding\n\n**Bunker Mode due to tail event:** Given the inability to perform withdrawals during Bunker mode, stETH's market price may trade at a discount to its underlying 1:1 represented value. When a negative rebase occurs, it can concurrently trigger a deviation in the underlying value of the cumulative stETH collateral balance. This means that similar to how fundamental oracles operate, the underlying value of the collateral will decrease immediately.\n\n**Long validator exit queue:** Long validator exit queues can lead to stETH trading below its fundamental value due to the associated implied duration risk. If a liquidation event is not profitable because the market price deviation of stETH/ETH is less than the liquidation bonus, liquidation will not occur. Instead, the market must revert to a price where liquidation becomes profitable.  \n\n**stETH/ETH Market Price Deviation During Selloff:** The consolidation of market liquidity and the associated non-atomic withdrawal mechanism of stETH can result in market price depegs that correlate with large ETH selloffs, thereby eating into the effective liquidator incentive.\n\nUnliquidated positions due to market price moves without triggering bunker mode will not result in bad debt however as this type of depeg is temporary and will reconverge to the backing value in time.\n\n## Mitigations\n\nTo mitigate the risks associated with such events, especially when stETH's market-priced value falls below the liquidation threshold, security measures should be implemented. One such measure is setting the quota of w/stETH to zero when Bunker mode is activated, or the market price deviating below a specified threshold as a function of the liquidation threshold and bonus. This precaution prevents new positions from taking advantage of the hypothetical deviation in the underlying market price of stETH and its implied value on Gearbox. By doing so, the protocol can ensure that no new loans are issued against stETH during periods of market instability, thereby maintaining stability within the system.\n\nLido has never experienced a day of negative rebasing or entered bunker mode historically, but these tail events should be accounted for to ensure the continued solvency of Gearbox. We are currently developing a comprehensive risk methodology and simulation framework to accurately account for the effective payoff of liquidations using fundamental oracles, incorporating the specific intricacies of the Gearbox protocol.\n\n## Technical specification\nIt's proposed for the oracles to be set to match the following list:\n**stETH oracles:**\n- Mainnet:\n    - main: [Chainlink ETH/USD](https://etherscan.io/address/0x5f4eC3Df9cbd43714FE2740f5E3616155c5b8419)\n    - reserve: [composite oracle that is currently used as main](https://etherscan.io/address/0xb6dA53dBD0A52Fe5f2023aC00977e3AcBB789005)\n\n**wstETH oracles:**\n- Mainnet:\n    - main: WSTETH_ORACLE based on Lido wstETH/stETH conversion rate and  [Chainlink ETH/USD](https://etherscan.io/address/0x5f4eC3Df9cbd43714FE2740f5E3616155c5b8419)\n    - reserve: [composite oracle that is currently used as main](https://etherscan.io/address/0x2C93A4C3599c142FE15a8b105eef0cb7F90Fa4CC)\n- Arbitrum:\n   - main: COMPOSITE_ORACLE based on [Chainlink wstETH/stETH Exchange Rate](https://arbiscan.io/address/0xB1552C5e96B312d0Bf8b554186F846C40614a540) and [Chainlink ETH/USD](https://arbiscan.io/address/0x639Fe6ab55C921f74e7fac1ee960C0B6293ba612)\n    - reserve: [composite oracle that is currently used as main](https://arbiscan.io/address/0x93791d9bAb4098623F49c851f8d83A22B0Bf6edf)\n- Optimism:\n   - main: COMPOSITE_ORACLE based on [Chainlink wstETH/stETH Exchange Rate](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0xe59EBa0D492cA53C6f46015EEa00517F2707dc77) and [Chainlink ETH/USD](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0x13e3Ee699D1909E989722E753853AE30b17e08c5)\n    - reserve: [composite oracle that is currently used as main](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0x0c0F381897cDb2D9b826F87c87e6E17f0a954c02)\n\n# Transaction log\nTxs log can be found [here](https://gearboxprotocol.notion.site/GIP-154-4c6e36abd35344d88bba33bfd39abad8?pvs=4).\n\n**Mainnet**:\nmd5 checksum: 9a0fdf63e3401dca8422f994b6d411c9\n**Arbitrum**:\nmd5 checksum: 61a1e789b6f686a2c7bf3446b7d43263\n**Optimism**:\nmd5 checksum: 4a4fcd9d67e9e6bf55473a89c1e5e153",

      "title": "[GIP-158] WBTC Risk Analysis and Temporary Recommendation",
      "content": "# Author\nChaos Labs\n\n### Summary\n\nChaos Labs issues recommendations in response to the recent announcement by BitGo regarding the WBTC transition to joint custody.\n\n### Analysis\n\nOn August 9th, [BitGo announced](https://x.com/BitGo/status/1821927623494439130) its intention to transfer the management of the WBTC product to a new joint venture with BiT Global, expected to take effect within 60 days. This transition will move WBTC custody from its current U.S.-based jurisdiction to multiple international locations, including Hong Kong and Singapore. The involvement of Justin Sun and the Tron ecosystem in this partnership raises concerns about potential influence or control over the new entity overseeing WBTC, which could introduce additional counterparty risks.\n\n**Current Stance:** Given the limited public information available regarding the event anticipated in approximately 60 days, issuing a significant risk-off recommendation at this stage would be premature and could potentially have long-term negative implications for Gearbox. Currently, there are no observable fundamental changes in custody practices or proof of reserves, and the legal framework continues to provide robust protection against rehypothecation or tampering with user-minted WBTC.\n\nNevertheless, considering the historically low utilization rates across the Gearbox protocol, Chaos Labs advises a temporary reduction in exposure to WBTC as a collateral asset by setting the quota limit to zero (`ForbidToken`). This precautionary measure reflects the minimal current exposure across all open credit accounts involving WBTC, which amounts to approximately $28K, as shown in the accompanying plot.  \n\n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreifnq5z27yju2bofbhwjqxe3pwvuk4p7rpc2d7qpew6bhyouohcpoy)\n    \n\nFrom a risk-reward perspective, this limited exposure offers minimal potential upside, making it more prudent to adopt a cautious approach for the time being. Therefore, temporarily reducing exposure to WBTC as collateral limits exposing Gearbox materially to WBTC risks down the line with minimal costs in terms of quota usage. Once more detailed information regarding the custody changes becomes available, we will reassess and provide updated recommendations accordingly.\n\nWe recommend no change to borrowing from the WBTC market at this time, as in any event, supplied capital cannot be utilized as collateral on Gearbox.\n\n**Action Plan:**\n\n- **Active Monitoring:** We will continuously monitor the situation, staying vigilant for any new developments or information releases related to the upcoming event.\n- **Timely Updates:** As more details emerge, we will promptly update the forum to keep the Venus community informed.\n- **Future Recommendations:** Based on the evolving information landscape, we will issue new recommendations as necessary to ensure the market's safety and stability.\n\n### Specification\n\nSet the quota limit to zero for the following:\n\n- WETH - Optimism\n- WETH - Ethereum\n- WETH - Arbitrum\n- USDC.e - Optimism\n- USDC - Ethereum\n- USDC - Arbitrum\n- USDC.e - Arbitrum\n\n# Transaction log\nTransaction log is available [here](https://gearboxprotocol.notion.site/GIP-158-88c8e7f735bd462fa348b1900f1b59e0?pvs=4)\nMd5 checksums: \nArbitrum - a57697f21d5fcb2a4bedc9720e719405\nMainnet - b14692489cd2a73b16c5ed3a4501b190\nOptimism - 286ec5bd02f205f1f5097d9469f2f6a3",

      "content": "## Author\nChaos Labs\n## **Summary**\nChaos Labs has conducted research regarding a potential integration involving Mellow restaking vaults.\n*Note: The following analysis is based exclusively on market risk considerations, deliberately excluding centralization and third-party risk factors. Should the community seek to mitigate exposure to Mellow, it may be prudent to consider the implementation of more conservative supply and borrow caps.*\n## **Analysis**\n**What is Mellow?**\nMany of the vault tokens associated with Mellow exhibit limited on-chain liquidity, or lack any liquidity altogether. This deficiency necessitates a substantial withdrawal time buffer, often extending over multiple days, which complicates the feasibility of atomic liquidations. In light of these liquidity constraints, the immediate integration of the following vaults will be approached with relatively low caps to ensure stability and effectively manage risk:\n\n- **pzETH**: On-chain liquidity with a liquidation bonus below 3% (900 ETH)\n    Contract: 0x8c9532a60E0E7C6BbD2B2c1303F63aCE1c3E9811\n- **rstETH**: On-chain liquidity below 350 ETH\n    Contract: 0x7a4EffD87C2f3C55CA251080b1343b605f327E3a\n- **steakLRT**: On-chain liquidity below 350 ETH\n    Contract: 0xBEEF69Ac7870777598A04B2bd4771c71212E6aBc\n- **amphrETH**: On-chain liquidity below 350 ETH\n    Contract: 0x5fD13359Ba15A84B76f7F87568309040176167cd\n    \nThe underlying assets that constitute these vault tokens are sound liquid staked tokens (LSTs), for which an LT of 90% is recommended for all. These vaults utilize a fundamental oracle for valuation purposes. \n\n## Recommendation\n\n### **pzETH**\n**Asset**: pzETH\n**Chain**: Ethereum\n**Credit Manager**: Restaking WETH\n**Quota Limit**: 1800\n**minRate**: .5%\n**maxRate**: 30%\n**Liquidation Threshold**: 0.90\n\n### **rstETH**\n**Asset**: rstETH\n**Chain**: Ethereum\n**Credit Manager**: Restaking WETH\n**Quota Limit**: 700\n**minRate**: .5%\n**maxRate**: 30%\n**Liquidation Threshold**: 0.90\n\n### **steakLRT**\n**Asset**: steakLRT\n**Chain**: Ethereum\n**Credit Manager**: Restaking WETH\n**Quota Limit**: 700\n**minRate**: .5%\n**maxRate**: 30%\n**Liquidation Threshold**: 0.90\n\n### **amphrETH**\n**Asset**: amphrETH\n**Chain**: Ethereum\n**Credit Manager**: Restaking WETH\n**Quota Limit**: 700\n**minRate**: .5%\n**maxRate**: 30%\n**Liquidation Threshold**: 0.90\n\n## Trade adapters:\nAdd the following pools to the trade adapter of Restaking WETH CM\n1.

This feature enhances the user experience for borrowers by reducing losses associated with liquidations and increases protocol stability by mitigating the effects of mass deleveraging during periods of increased market volatility. \n\nPartial liquidations require PartialLiquidationBotV3 to have permissions to add and withdraw collateral, as well as to decrease debt. Reserve feed is also needed for asset to be partially liquidatable.\n\n# Technical specification\n1. Connect PartialLiquidationBotV3 as a special permissions bot for \"crvUSD Tier 1\" credit manager to enable partial liquidations. \n2. Deploy crvUSDUSDT and crvUSDUSDC price feeds of type CURVE_2LP_ORACLE based on previously deployed bounded [crvUSD](https://etherscan.io/address/0x33fde79d1dA7175Accb426e7A9185B4817F87D52), [USDT](https://etherscan.io/address/0x75c5765A94f6FD00C7D345918159B6B84577c6be) and [USDC](https://etherscan.io/address/0x76514dB6958587387D939A4638c038DBF9EC752d) price feeds.

However, its market cap in ETH terms has recently declined once withdrawals were opened.

      "content": "# Authors\n@desnakeee\n# Summary\nThis proposal aims to increase Credit Managers' debt limits on Arbitrum.\n# Motivation\nCurrently, risks associated with specific assets are managed through a thorough process of setting quota limits and LTs. However, Collateral Managers (CMs) lack specialization, resulting in CM-specific portfolios of allowed collaterals having very similar risk profiles.\n\nFor example, a Tier 2 WETH CM on Arbitrum differs from a higher-tier CM only due to the presence of the ARB token, which has the smallest quota and reduced LT.\n\nTherefore, it is proposed to significantly increase the borrowing limits for all CMs (effectively making them unlimited compared to current levels), regardless of their tier. This proposal is suggested to be implemented on Arbitrum first, as multiple CMs have already hit their debt limits, preventing further utilization.\n\n# Technical implementation\n| Credit manager    | Proposed debt limit |\n| -------- | -------------- |\n| Trade WETH Tier 1 Arbitrum   | 8000 WETH              |\n| Trade WETH Tier 2 Arbitrum | 4000 WETH              |\n| Trade USDC Tier 1 Arbitrum      | 16000000 USDC              |\n| Trade USDC Tier 2 Arbitrum      | 8000000 USDC              |\n\n# Transaction log\nTransaction logs can be found [here](https://gearboxprotocol.notion.site/GIP-151-4b19824450e0438dad578b2ea37a3598?pvs=4)\nmd5 checksum is 40a741e2a7c06891c2156af1533b376d.\n\n# Voting\nSimple Approve/Reject",

In fact, many proposals do actively seek to spend these tokens to improve the DAO. \n\nAn increased circulating supply will increase the market cap, but it will also result in a higher mcap/FDV ratio.

Chaos Labs' methodology for setting this Quota Limit is based on 2x the price impact under the 3% Liquidation Bonus. With this methodology, there is room for a ~3,800 rswETH Quota Limit.  However, given that Swell has not yet enabled withdrawals, we have taken a more conservative approach of doubling the current Quota Limit from 500 to 1,000.\n## **Specification**\n**Chain**: Ethereum\n**Asset**: rswETH\n**Pool**: ETH\n**Quota Limit**: 500 -> 1,000\n\n# Transaction log\nTransaction logs can be found [here](https://gearboxprotocol.notion.site/GIP-144-3b0a4d1e9f5a4862bb8ae811d37d88f7?pvs=4)\nmd5 checksum is 6ed8679c99fd5630c10d0b54ee342196\n\n# Voting \nSimple Approve/Reject",

      "content": "## **Author**\n@Chaos Labs\n## **Summary**\nThis proposal aims to establish an effective price cap for all stablecoins in response to the recent crvUSD price spike caused by mass liquidation events.\n## **Motivation**\n### **Addressing Price Volatility**\nRecent price spikes resulting from mass liquidation events have raised concerns about the stability and reliability of various stablecoins. Stablecoins are designed to maintain a stable value, typically pegged closely to $1. Highly temporary upward deviations can potentially induce substantial liquidation events through debt mechanisms.\n### **Implementing a Price Cap**\nTo mitigate these risks and enhance stability across the ecosystem, we propose the implementation of an effective price cap for all stablecoins. By capping prices, we can prevent excessive temporary surges and defend against potential manipulation events, ensuring stablecoins remain functional for their intended use cases.\n## **Proposal**\nWe recommend the following actions be undertaken for all stablecoins:\n**Implement a Maximum Price Cap:**\n- Set a maximum price cap for all stablecoins at $1.04.\n\n## Technical specification\nIt's proposed deploy following price feeds that are bounded by  $1.04 and set them as main feeds for the corresponding tokens on all chains:\n\n### Mainnet\n1.

To solve this problem it's proposed to increase Tier ETH 1 CM to allow leveraging for whales. Tier 2 CM's bounds will be left as is, so leveraging will stay affordable for smaller deposits.\n\n## Tier 1 CM debt limit\nAfter raising quota limit for ezETH in GIP-137, debt limit in Tier 1 CM was filled.\n\n## Add ezETH to Tier 2 CM\nAs Tier 1 CM's minDebt and maxDebt will be increased it's proposed to add ezETH to Tier 2 CM with smaller bounds to keep it affordable for everyone.\n\n# Technical specification\n\n## \"Trade WETH Tier 1 Arbitrum\"  CM  parameters\n\n__minDebt__: 7 ETH\n__maxDebt__: 150 ETH\n__debtLimit__: 2000 ETH\n\n## \"Trade WETH Tier 2 Arbitrum\"  CM parameters\n\n__Add ezETH as collateral___  with __LT = 0.87__\n\nIt’ s proposed to __add following adapters__ :\n- Balancer\n    - ezETH/wstETH (0xb61371ab661b1acec81c699854d2f911070c059e000000000000000000000516)\n- Uniswap\n    - ezETH/ETH 1% (0xa245416e3bEd0E60dd76ef400dE7396FC3F4cAa3)\n - wstETH/ezETH 0.05% (0xF2C6091BFA490694f3E931020572f4cA9F6BE480)\n- Camelot \n    - ezETH/WETH (0xaA45265A94C93802BE9511E426933239117E658f)\n\n## PartialLiquidationBotV3 permissions\nIt's proposed to connect PartialLiquidationBotV3 as a special permissions bot for \"Trade USDC Tier 1 Arbitrum\" and \"Trade USDC Tier 2 Arbitrum\" credit managers to enable partial liquidations. \n\n## Reserve price feeds\nPartial liquidations require tokens to have reserve price feeds as they currently rely on withdrawals being available.\n\nIt's proposed to set Redstone pull feeds as reserve feeds for the following tokens:\n1.

      "content": "# Authors\n@desnakeee\n# Summary\nThis proposal aims to change risk parameters for v3 Optimism deployment.\n# Motivation\nThe major part of Gearbox utilization comes from Ethereum use cases, namely leveraged restaking and points farming. Currently, other use cases contribute very little to the protocol's revenue, yet they still require monitoring for associated risks. \nThat is the main reason for the recent reassessment of risk parameters  ([GIP-130](https://discord.com/channels/841203475606011905/1240615338790621194), [GIP-137]( https://discord.com/channels/841203475606011905/1245648331875553312)), with the goal of maximally reducing the risk surface while not hurting the protocol's utilization.\n\n# Key risk parameters\nThe approach is to set the parameters of major tokens to match those used in Ethereum and Arbitrum deployments. The parameters of deployment-specific tokens are adjusted according to their liquidity.\n## WETH market parameters\n### WETH v3 pool limits\n| Token    | Proposed limit |\n| -------- | -------------- |\n| yvWETH   | 0              |\n| yvUSDC.e | 0              |\n| WLD      | 0              |\n| SNX      | 0              |\n| OP       | 150            |\n\n### WETH Tier 1 Optimism Credit Manager parameters\nIt’s proposed to __forbid OP token__ (Set LT=0) in WETH Tier 1 Optimism Credit Manager.\n| minDebt                   | 7    |\n| ------------------------- | ---- |\n| maxDebt                   | 150  |\n| liquidationPremium        | 0.05 |\n| liquidationPremiumExpired | 0.05 |\n\n| token  | Proposed LT |\n| ------ | ----------- |\n| USDC.e | 0.87        |\n| WBTC   | 0.9         |\n| wstETH | 0.9         |\n| rETH   | 0.9         |\n\n__Ramp start:__ July 22, 2024 20:00 GMT\n__Ramp duration:__ 14 days\n\n### Trade WETH Tier 2 Optimism Credit Manager parameters\n\n| minDebt                   | 0.35 |\n| ------------------------- | ---- |\n| maxDebt                   | 7    |\n| liquidationPremium        | 0.05 |\n| liquidationPremiumExpired | 0.05 |\n\n| token  | New LT |\n| ------ | ------ |\n| USDC.e | 0.87   |\n\n__Ramp start:__ July 22, 2024 20:00 GMT\n__Ramp duration:__ 14 days\n\nIt’s proposed to add following tokens to credit manager with the parameters stated below:\n\n| token  | LT  |\n| ------ | --- |\n| OP     | 0.8 |\n| WBTC   | 0.9 |\n| wstETH | 0.9 |\n| rETH   | 0.9 |\n\nIt’ s proposed to add following adapters:\n\n- Uniswap V3:\n  - WETH/OP 0.3%\n  - WETH/OP 0.05%\n  - WETH/WBTC 0.3%\n  - WETH/WBTC 0.05%\n  - WETH/wstETH 0.01%\n- Balancer\n  - wstETH/WETH CLP (0x7ca75bdea9dede97f8b13c6641b768650cb837820002000000000000000000d5)\n  - rETH/WETH (0x4fd63966879300cafafbb35d157dc5229278ed2300020000000000000000002b)\n- Velodrome\n  - WETH/OP Concentrated volatile\n  - OP/USDC.e Concentrated volatile\n  - wstETH/WETH Concentrated stable\n\n## USDC.e market parameters\n### Main USDC.e v3 pool limits\n\n| Token    | Proposed limit |\n| -------- | -------------- |\n| yvWETH   | 0              |\n| yvUSDC.e | 0              |\n| yvDAI    | 0              |\n| yvUSDT   | 0              |\n| WLD      | 0              |\n| SNX      | 0              |\n| OP       | 500000         |\n\n### USDC.e Tier 1 Optimism Credit Manager parameters\nIt’s proposed to __forbid OP token__ (Set LT=0) in USDC.e Tier 1 Optimism Credit Manager.\n| minDebt                   | 20000  |\n| ------------------------- | ------ |\n| maxDebt                   | 400000 |\n| liquidationPremium        | 0.05   |\n| liquidationPremiumExpired | 0.05   |\n\n| token  | Proposed LT |\n| ------ | ----------- |\n| WBTC   | 0.87        |\n| WETH   | 0.87        |\n| wstETH | 0.87        |\n| rETH   | 0.87        |\n\n__Ramp start:__ July 22, 2024 20:00 GMT\n__Ramp duration:__ 14 days\n\n### USDC.e Tier 2 Optimism Credit Manager parameters\n| minDebt                   | 1000  |\n| ------------------------- | ----- |\n| maxDebt                   | 20000 |\n| liquidationPremium        | 0.05  |\n| liquidationPremiumExpired | 0.05  |\n\n| token | Proposed LT |\n| ----- | ----------- |\n| WETH  | 0.87        |\n\n__Ramp start:__ July 22, 2024 20:00 GMT\n__Ramp duration:__ 14 days\n\nIt’s proposed to add following tokens to credit manager with the parameters stated below:\n| token  | LT   |\n| ------ | ---- |\n| OP     | 0.8  |\n| WBTC   | 0.87 |\n| wstETH | 0.87 |\n| rETH   | 0.87 |\n\nIt’ s proposed to add following adapters:\n\n- Uniswap V3:\n  - WETH/WBTC 0.3%\n  - WETH/WBTC 0.05%\n  - wstETH/WETH 0.01%\n  - OP/USDC.e 0.3%\n  - WETH/OP 0.3%\n  - WETH/OP 0.05%\n  - USDC/OP 0.3%\n- Balancer\n  - wstETH/WETH CLP (0x7ca75bdea9dede97f8b13c6641b768650cb837820002000000000000000000d5)\n  - rETH/WETH (0x4fd63966879300cafafbb35d157dc5229278ed2300020000000000000000002b)\n- Velodrome\n  - WETH/OP Concentrated volatile\n  - OP/USDC.e Concentrated volatile\n  - WETH/USDC.e Concentrated volatile\n  - wstETH/WETH Concentrated stable\n  - wstETH/OP Basic volatile\n  - USDC/USDC.e Concentrated stable\n\n## PartialLiquidationBotV3 & its permissions\nIt's proposed to deploy the PartialLiquidationBotV3 contract on Optimism and connect it as a special permissions bot for all current Credit Managers, which will enable partial liquidations. \n\n## Reserve price feeds\nPartial liquidations require tokens to have reserve price feeds as they currently rely on withdrawals being available.\n\nIt's proposed to set Redstone pull feeds as reserve feeds for the following tokens:\n1.

      "title": "[GIP-145] Gearbox <> Aera - Treasury Management Proposal",
      "content": "## Overview\nAera Finance (https://aera.finance/) is an autonomous, non-custodial, and data-driven protocol for DAO’s to manage their treasury. Aera is currently utilized by DAOs like Compound, Threshold, Seamless, and others, as well as by DAO service providers including Questbook and OpenZeppelin. This proposal outlines a partnership where Aera will integrate several Gearbox v3 passive strategies as available options and Gearbox will deposit $1M into an Aera vault to be deployed via those strategies. Aera will comarket with Gearbox and make future Aera customers aware of the Gearbox integration for potential use.\n\n## About Aera\nAera is a solution for optimizing DAO funds autonomously and on-chain. For most DAOs, treasury funds (e.g. reserves, treasuries, safety modules, backstops) are not actively managed or adjusted based on market conditions. For DAOs, this can lead to an inability to maintain runway, cover liabilities, and benefit from growth in the market. Traditional institutions can allocate funds to more nimble managers who make day-to-day decisions, but DAOs face numerous challenges with this model including governance and creating strong incentive alignment with external managers. Aera was built and incubated by the team at Gauntlet (https://gauntlet.xyz/).\nAera helps to minimize bureaucracy. The DAO doesn’t need to plan strategies, but rather just pick assets and define its objective.\nThe Aera protocol autonomously rebalances DAO treasury based on market conditions.\nGauntlet is currently the first Guardian operating on Aera.\n\n## How Aera Works\nThis initial version of Aera allows DAOs to effectively manage treasury assets in an autonomous, risk-aware manner. After successfully testing Aera internally at Gauntlet for over 1 year and operating a ETH/USDC Aera vault on Polygon with our own funds, we collaborated with other blue-chip DeFi treasuries, like Compound (https://www.comp.xyz/t/aera-pilot-for-compound-v2-reserves/4655), Moonwell (https://forum.moonwell.fi/t/proposal-pilot-aera-for-moonwell/490), and Threshold (https://forum.threshold.network/t/tip-058-pilot-aera-for-threshold/658) to onboard their treasuries to Aera. \n\nIn addition, Aera’s security has been audited by Spearbit, which can be seen in our docs (https://docs.aera.finance/contracts/security). Additionally, Aera conducted treasury management research for the Arbitrum DAO (https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arbitrum-treasury-management-report-by-aera/20652).\n\nAera provides DAOs with a one-stop, non-custodial solution for managing treasury funds efficiently and transparently. The Aera protocol consists of vaults, which are constructed on a per-protocol basis and can hold a combination of stablecoins, native tokens, and other cryptocurrencies. See attached image for diagram.\n\nThe portfolio strategy of the vault is determined by each DAO and is highly customizable ranging from simply keeping fund proportions in line with liabilities, to complex strategies using liquidity positions to provide POL. Vaults are automatically rebalanced by vault Guardians who propose updates to the portfolio based on the DAO’s desired portfolio strategy.\n\n## About Aera Guardians\nWhen an Aera vault is created the vault owner (in this case Gearbox DAO) specifies a set of guardrails for their treasury. These guardrails include:\n\n- Assets allowed in the vault (USDC, ETH, etc.)\n- Whitelisted strategies (stablecoin yield, eth yield, protocol owned liquidity, etc.)\n- Whitelisted DeFi platforms (Gearbox Passive v3 strategies, Uniswap GEAR/USDC pool, etc.)\n- Slippage (e.g. max 3% daily slippage, or as defined by the DAO)\nTreasury objective function\n\nThe Guardian will then utilize off-chain logic to suggest optimal treasury rebalancing within the confines of the vault guardrails. Guardians are not able to suggest transactions that violate the vault’s guardrails nor can they withdraw the assets from the vault. For the purposes of this proposal, Gauntlet will be the Guardian for Gearbox’s Aera vault.\n\nGuardians cannot:\n\n- Withdraw vault funds\n- Swap into an asset or deploy a strategy outside of vault guardrails\n- Utilize non-whitelisted protocols\n\n# Proposal\nAera will integrate several Gearbox v3 passive strategies (USDC, ETH, DAI) as possible yield generation strategies for Aera vaults. Once we integrate, we will set-up a vault owned by the Gearbox DAO at which point Gearbox would deploy $1M notional into these integrated strategies. The Gearbox DAO can withdraw the funds from Aera at any time.\n\n## Implementation Steps\n\n1. Gearbox governance approves partnership proposal.\n2. Aera integrates Gearbox v3 passive strategies.\n3. Gearbox deposits $1M USDC into an Aera vault.\n4. The Aera vault autonomously swaps the $1M USDC into equal amounts of USDC, ETH, and DAI with minimal slippage. Gauntlet, as the guardian, will cover all gas costs.\n5. The vault will then deposit the assets into their corresponding Gearbox v3 strategies.\n6. Gearbox DAO can view the live status of their vault, the underlying strategies, and historical performance via the Aera Dashboard.\n7. Gearbox DAO can update their treasury strategy in the future to include any other available strategies:\n a. Levered ETH staking\n b. Other stable yield strategies\n c. Protocol-Owned Liquidity\n d. Targeted Volatility\n e. Diversification out of native governance token with minimal price impact\n8. Gearbox DAO can access any or all of their funds via the non-custodial design of Aera at any time.\n\n## Benefits for Gearbox\n1. Gearbox/Aera Availability: Aera will comarket this partnership with Gearbox to promote the integration. Current and future Aera customers will be able to opt for Gearbox’s strategies in their treasury management.\n2. Autonomous treasury management: Gearbox will be able to maximize the utility of its treasury while benefiting from continuous data-driven risk management. As DeFi markets evolve, the Aera vault will autonomously update the specific positions in the vault, if needed.\n3. *No fees, no lock-ups, non-custodial:* Aera currently offers vaults to users with 0% fees and no lock-ups. Due to Aera's non-custodial design, Gearbox will be able to withdraw its assets whenever it wants. This includes any and all vault operations.\n\n## Final notes\nIntegrating Aera with Gearbox gives Aera an additional attractive source of yield for its current and future customers. Per DeFi Llama, Gearbox's base rates on the selected strategies are competitive, if not sometimes better, than what Aera offers today (current: Aave, Compound, Morpho), and Aera's customers have primarily indexed towards base yield. The Aera team is in active conversations with other protocols who are interested in onboarding to Aera and utilizing Gearbox passive strategies. Should Aera integrate, Gearbox would be a noted and available option to both current and future Aera customers.\n\nRegarding fees: Currently, Aera charges no fees whatsoever. At some point, Aera will turn on its notion of a fee switch. However, there is no current schedule for this and it's not on the foreseeable roadmap. Furthermore, even when a fee switch is turned on, the fee would have to be accepted by the vault owner (in this case, the Gearbox DAO) in order to take effect. There is no possibility that fees can be turned on without the vault owner accepting them via transaction. As Aera's roadmap develops, we'll ensure we keep the Gearbox DAO informed of any information regarding this well in advance of any go live.",

      "content": "Author: Matthew Graham from TokenLogic\n(Posted by amplice on behalf of TokenLogic)\n\n![image](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/By3QsF27A.png)\n\n# Summary\n\nThis proposal presents an overview of the scope of work for TokenLogic is to deliver as part of a Financial Service Partnership with the Gearbox community. \n\nDuring the initial phase, TokenLogic is to deliver the Gearbox Portal. The Portal will provide insights into the following:\n\n1. Revenue Generation\n2. Treasury Holdings\n3. Runway Analysis\n\nThe initial partnership is to commence 5th July, 2024, will cover Ethereum, Arbitrum and Optimism networks and will be delivered Oct/Nov 2024. TokenLogic will continue to host and maintain the dashboards until end of July 2025.\n\n# Gearbox Portal \n\nThe Gearbox Portal will provide users with easy access to into how the Gearbox v3 generates revenue, what asset the DAO holds in its Treasury and how those asset are currently being distributed.\n\n## Revenue \n\nThe Gearbox Portal is to provide granular insights into various revenue streams generated by the protocol. The portal is to present hourly and daily data periods for each dToken revenue stream, on each of the three instances of Gearbox v3. \n\nExample of the various Fee Revenue streams:\n\n* Liquidation Fee, which depends on Credit Manager\n* Base APY Rate, split between passive lenders and the DAO\n* Gauges: Quota APY Rate, split between passive lenders and the DAO\n* Quota Fee: Goes only to the DAO\n\nThe revenue streams will be presented in aggregate, per iteration of Gearbox, and each nomination. These revenue figures will used to project weekly, monthly and annual revenue. An example dashboard can be found [here](https://aave.tokenlogic.com.au/aave-revenue). \n\nIn presenting the revenue data, both realised and unrealised revenue will be displayed. Unrealised revenue will provide insights into the total revenue being generated by the Gearbox Protocol and actual revenue will reflect what is being received by the Treasury.\n\nAt a high level, the portal will provide insights into how users are interacting with Gearbox v3, popular collateral and debt asset combinations, and the resulting revenue generated from these strategies. The portal will help showcase the main drivers of Gearbox revenue streams. \n\n## Treasury\n\nA comprehensive dashboard showing the composition of the DAO holdings and the yield currently being earned on those assets. \n\nExample performance tracking metrics are shown below:\n\n* Overview metrics such as total value, 30 day change and % held passively\n* Distribution of assets by type, across networks and protocols\n* Performance of each asset (dToken) allocation\n  * $ of revenue generated from yield over specified time period\n  * % of yield being generated over specified time period\n* Projected treasury value based upon\n    * Protocol Fee Revenue\n    * Yield generated from Treasury Holdings\n\nThe majority of charts and tables will be set to update daily. A summary table will show the value of the DAO's assets at the end of each month dating back to when v3 was launched. \n\n## Runway\n\nThe TokenLogic team will present the DAO's expenses in the form of a visual runway/cashflow projection. The dashboard will provide a transparent overview of the DAOs spend and contextualise it relative to existing revenue sources and asset holdings.\n\nExamples of more insights: \n\n* Detail breakdown of known expenses (like Service Providers)  \n* Distinctly allocated budgets (Reserve Fund, Referral Program & Liquidity Mining)\n* Performance metrics such as Revenue v Spend\n\nAll approved budgets and revenue streams are to be reflected in the Runway table. Charts shall reflect the relationship between current holdings and projected expenditure levels. \n\n# Pricing\n\nBased upon community feedback and understanding the phase at which Gearbox is at in its growth, we propose the following payment structure: \n\nTotal Value: 50k USD paid 50/50 upfront/delivery\n\n* 25k USD equivalent paid 50/50 GEAR/USDC\n* 25k USD equivalent paid 50/50 GEAR/USDC\n\nEstimated completion expected around Oct/Nov 2024.\n\nWherever practical, we will endeavor to incorporate feedback and any requests for further insights beyond those shared above.\n\n# Next Steps\n\nPending the approval of this proposal, TokenLogic will commence this scope starting 5th July, 2024.\n\n# Voting\n\nGearbox voting participants can vote for any of the three options detailed below:\n\n1) FOR\n2) AGAINST\n3) ABSTAIN\n\n# Disclaimer\n\nTokenLogic has not been compensated by any third party for publishing this publication.\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",

      "title": "[GIP-142] Formation of Grants SubDAO to Manage Grant Funds",
      "content": "Author: amplice\nSummary:\nCreate a dedicated Gearbox Grants subDAO and utilize the existing VIBES multisig wallets as the new subDAO wallets on all relevant chains and L2s (Mainnet, Arbitrum, Optimism). This will help streamline the management and allocation of current and future grant funds. VIBES multisig will be created as needed on chains where it does not currently exist.\n\nMotivation:\nThe Gearbox Foundation has successfully secured grants from various ecosystem funds, such as the recent grants from the Optimism Collective (20,000 OP tokens) and the Arbitrum Foundation (650,000 ARB tokens). As Gearbox continues to grow and contribute to multiple ecosystems, it is also possible that we will receive additional grants in the future.\n\nCurrently, these grant funds are being received by the Gearbox Foundation multisig. Many grants come with KYC requirements, and the Gearbox Treasury multisig has members who are not active Gearbox contributors and it would be unreasonable to expect these multisig volunteers to go through KYC. For this reason we have directed grant funds towards Gearbox Foundation.\n\nHowever, the Foundation is required to seek DAO approval first before it takes any action - this includes distribution/allocation of grant funds. This creates some friction in Gearbox's ability to adhere to grant timelines in terms of the distribution/allocation of funds.\n\nTo streamline the management and allocation of current and future grant funds, we propose the creation of a dedicated Gearbox Grants SubDAO and associated multisig wallets. This will help prevent the need to saturate the DAO voting process with numerous grants-related transactions, especially since the grant funds that are received are often already earmarked/allocated for certain uses in the grants application process (see our [Arbitrum grant proposal here](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/gearbox-ltipp-application-final/21672), and the [Optimism grant proposal here](https://app.charmverse.io/op-grants/gearbox-protocol-22211914786751796).\n\nThe Grants subDAO will be responsible for allocating grant funds as agreed in relevant grant applications, or as agreed upon with the entities/persons who awarded the grant to Gearbox.\n\nTechnical Specification:\n\n- Establish a Gearbox Grants subDAO. The Grants subDAO will reuse the VIBES multisig that currently enacts transactions for the VIBES subDAO for efficiency's sake. [You can see details of the existing multisig here](https://app.safe.global/settings/setup?safe=eth:0x8ACEd4217bA809B0F7164cdbAF7c4901Bd6575Ac)\n- The Gearbox Foundation will transfer all previously received grant funds (e.g., OP and ARB tokens) to the respective subDAO multisig wallets.\n- Future grant funds received by the Foundation multisig will also be sent to the subDAO multisig wallets.\n- The Grants subDAO will be responsible for allocating the grant funds as outlined in the original grant proposals submitted by Gearbox, and/or in line with guidance from the entities or persons who awarded the grant.\n- The subDAO will maintain transparency by providing regular updates to the main Gearbox DAO regarding grant fund allocation and usage.\n\nBenefits:\n\n- Greatly simplifies the process of managing and allocating grant funds.\n- Avoids DAO/governance saturation\n- Allows for more flexibility and faster decision-making when allocating grant funds.\n- Maintains transparency and accountability to the main Gearbox DAO.\n- Allows Gearbox to adhere to various grant guidelines more rapidly and effectively (e.g distribute by X date)\n\nWe believe this proposal will create a more efficient and effective system for managing the grant funds that Gearbox receives, ensuring that they are allocated in alignment with the intended purposes outlined in our grant applications.",

Chaos Labs' methodology for setting this Quota Limit is based on 2x the price impact under the 3% Liquidation Bonus.\n\nAdditionally, we recommend switching to a fundamental oracle to protect against market volatility by reflecting the intrinsic value of locked assets.

      "title": "[GIP-137] Arbitrum risk parameters reassessment & native USDC pool onboarding.",
      "content": "# Authors\n@apeir99n, @DeSnake \n\n# Summary\nThis proposal aims to change risk parameters for v3 Arbitrum deployment and add native USDC pool and corresponding Credit Managers.\n\n# Motivation\n### Risk parameters reassessment:\nThe major part of Gearbox utilization comes from Ethereum use cases, namely leveraged restaking and points farming. Mostly it’s due to Ethereum domination in terms of DeFi liquidity, however there is clearly a trend of LRTs and Ethena expansion to L2s. Moreover, currently unutilized margin trading use case is expected to benefit from the cheapness and speed of L2s. Proposing to update risk parameters, we pursue the goal of increasing Arbitrum deployment safety (mainly to pay more attention to Ethereum deployment) while keeping it suitable for existing use cases.\n\n### Native USDC onboarding:\nArbitrum One has supported Bridged USDC since conception, with over a billion Bridged USDC currently in circulation. On June 8th 2023, Circle added support for the Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol and launched Arbitrum-native USDC, which enables direct minting and burning of Arbitrum-Native USDC on Arbitrum One. Due to this, the Bridged USDC token symbol was renamed from USDC to USDC.e to accommodate Arbitrum-native USDC. \nAs a part of Gearbox approved LTIPP programme we plan to direct part of approved grant to incentivize migration from USDC.e to USDC pool.\n\n# Technical specification\n\n## Tokens liquidity\n- WETH\n2000 WETH can be sold into ~7.8M USDC via Odos router with 0.89% slippage.\n- WBTC\n35 WBTC can be sold into ~2.4M USDC via Odos router with 0.87% slippage.\n35 WBTC can be sold into ~607 WETH via Odos router with 0.82% slippage.\nNote: ~120 WBTC can be sold using liquidity sources that are not integrated into Gearbox router.\n- wstETH\n1700 wstETH can be sold into WETH via Odos router with 0.7% slippage.\n1200 wstETH can be sold into ~5.5M USDC via Odos router with 0.93% slippage.\n- rethETH\n600 rETH can be sold into WETH via Odos router with 0.76% slippage.\n550 rETH can be sold into ~2.4M USDC via Odos router with 0.93% slippage.\n- cbETH\n230 cbETH can be sold into WETH via Odos router with 0.9% slippage.\n220 cbETH can be sold into ~900k USDC via Odos router with 0.91% slippage.\n- USDe\n5M USDe can be sold into USDC through Camelot V3 and Curve pools with 0.6% slippage\nCamelot V3 $10M TVL pool\nCurve $7M TVL pool\n- ARB\n1500000 ARB can be sold into ~1.9M USDC via Odos router with 0.88% slippage.\n1500000 ARB can be sold into ~476 WETH via Odos router with 0.81% slippage.\n- LINK\n13000 LINK can be sold into ~56 WETH via Odos router with 0.96% slippage.\n13000 LINK can be sold into ~220k USDC via Odos router with 0.9% slippage.\n- GMX\n4000 GMX can be sold into ~33 WETH via Odos router with 0.91% slippage.\n4000 GMX can be sold into ~130k USDC via Odos router with 0.85% slippage.\n- PENDLE\n75000 PENDLE can be sold into ~134 WETH via Odos router with 1.04% slippage.\n75000 PENDLE can be sold into ~528k USDC via Odos router with 0.85% slippage.\n\n# Key risk parameters\nIt’s proposed to increase liquidation premiums for all credit managers to match those of Mainnet deployment. It was initially set to lower values due to more frequent oracles updates on Arbitrum, but we believe it will be beneficial to set safer parameters to move risk monitoring attention to the most utilized Ethereum deployment.\n\nLimits are proposed according to available liquidity.\n\n## WETH market parameters\n### Main WETH v3 pool limits\n\n| Token  | Proposed limit |\n| ------ | -------------- |\n| USDC   | 2000           |\n| WBTC   | 1500           |\n| ARB    | 450            |\n| wstETH | 2000           |\n| rETH   | 1000           |\n| cbETH  | 500            |\n| LINK   | 0              |\n| GMX    | 0              |\n| PENDLE | 0              |\n\n### Trade WETH Tier 1 Arbitrum Credit Manager parameters\n\nIt’ s proposed to add following adapters:\n- Balancer\n    - wstETH/WETH (0x9791d590788598535278552eecd4b211bfc790cb000000000000000000000498)\n    - rETH/WETH (0xd0ec47c54ca5e20aaae4616c25c825c7f48d40690000000000000000000004ef)\n    - wstETH/rETH/cbETH (0x2d6ced12420a9af5a83765a8c48be2afcd1a8feb000000000000000000000500)\n\n| minDebt                   | 0.35 |\n| ------------------------- | ---- |\n| maxDebt                   | 7    |\n| liquidationPremium        | 0.05 |\n| liquidationPremiumExpired | 0.05 |\n\n| token  | Proposed LT |\n| ------ | ----------- |\n| USDC   | 0.87        |\n| USDC.e | 0.87        |\n| WBTC   | 0.87        |\n| wstETH | 0.9         |\n| rETH   | 0.9         |\n| cbETH  | 0.9         |\n\nLT ramp start: 11 Jun 00:00 GMT\nLT ramp duration: 14 days\n\n### Trade WETH Tier 2 Arbitrum Credit Manager parameters\nIt’ s proposed to add following adapters:\n- Uniswap V3:\n    - WETH/USDC 0.05% \n    - WETH/USDC.e 0.05% \n    - WETH/WBTC 0.05% \n    - WETH/ARB 0.05% \n    - WETH/ARB 0.3% \n    - wstETH/WETH 0.01% \n    - ARB/USDC.e 0.05% \n    - ARB/USDC 0.05% \n    - WBTC/WETH 0.3% \n- Balancer\n    - wstETH/WETH (0x9791d590788598535278552eecd4b211bfc790cb000000000000000000000498)\n    - rETH/WETH (0xd0ec47c54ca5e20aaae4616c25c825c7f48d40690000000000000000000004ef)\n    - wstETH/rETH/cbETH (0x2d6ced12420a9af5a83765a8c48be2afcd1a8feb000000000000000000000500)\n\n| minDebt                   | 0.35 |\n| ------------------------- | ---- |\n| maxDebt                   | 7    |\n| liquidationPremium        | 0.05 |\n| liquidationPremiumExpired | 0.05 |\n\n| token  | New LT |\n| ------ | ------ |\n| USDC   | 0.87   |\n| USDC.e | 0.87   |\n| WBTC   | 0.87   |\n| wstETH | 0.9    |\n| rETH   | 0.9    |\n| cbETH  | 0.9    |\n| ARB    | 0.8    |\n\nLT ramp start: 11 Jun 00:00 GMT\nLT ramp duration: 14 days\n\n## USDC.e market parameters\nSince a new UDC pool will be launched, it is proposed to prohibit the opening of new positions in USDC.e pool.

      "title": "[GIP-138]: Gearbox Foundation Budget, Authority & Certain Other Matters",
      "content": "## Author:\nGearbox Foundation (acting by DAObox Inc.)\n\n## Summary:\nThis proposal is aimed at approving:\n- Ratifying and authorising the grant of $40,000 to the Gearbox Foundation to finance the wrapper’s activities;\n- Authorising the Gearbox Foundation to engage in certain activities and transactions, and to enter into, amend or terminate, as may be required from time to time, associated legal agreements and other instruments; \n- Approving specific transactions requiring DAO’s consent. \n\n## Motivation\nGearbox Foundation serves as a legal wrapper for the GEAR DAO and is presently administered by DAObox.\n\nIn March 2023, the DAO passed a resolution [GIP-46](https://snapshot.org/#/gearbox.eth/proposal/0x23b65a4b42936009b81d4affdafbc14e7f96529773baaf6b6f9fb97213bb7122) determining certain short-term and long-term assignments for the Gearbox Foundation and providing for the allocation of a budget to finance the wrapper’s activities during the period from March until December 2023. \n\nDespite the foundation being able to extend the 2023 budget to cover an extra period of operations, as of end-May 2024 the budget is running out, and the foundation is therefore requesting a grant to top up its budget.\n\nFurthermore, certain matters have been accumulating during the last year of operations, which the foundation would like to ask the GEAR DAO to address, including to enable the foundation to operate more efficiently and better assist the DAO with their needs. \n\n## DAO Resolution\n### I. Foundation’s Budget Top-Up\nGearbox Foundation asks the GEAR DAO for a grant in the amount of $40,000, to be mainly used to finance the infrastructure and its maintenance, as well as certain other operational expenses during a 12-month period. Additionally, in December 2024, the Gearbox Foundation must complete its corporate continuation (renewal), which will require the payment of all applicable state and agent’s fees.\n\nWe request this grant now, before the current balance is exhausted, so that the Gearbox Foundation can continue functioning in an uninterrupted manner. **You can find our preliminary calculations [here](https://www.notion.so/gearboxprotocol/GIP-138-Preliminary-calculations-of-expected-expenses-96bcf8a6332f4d73a839939c2d3a12ac). MD5 checksum: FA709ED2A3C36D0176EB276113F208D0.**\n\n**By adopting this resolution, the GEAR DAO ratifies and authorises the grant of $40,000 to the Gearbox Foundation.** This amount will be transferred in the form of USDC and/or USDT to the foundation’s designated wallet, as may be notified by the foundation to the DAO or appropriate DAO contributors.\n\n### II. Foundation’s Authority to Enter into Agreements\n\nWe observe a substantial increase in the number and volume of the foundation’s transactions and matters overall. Although the majority of these transactions are authorised by the DAO, the GIPs often do not include clear authorisation for the foundation to engage in a specific transaction, enter into an agreement with a particular person, or undertake certain obligations or commitments.\n\nTo ensure that the foundation acts within the mandate and authority granted by the GEAR DAO, we propose the GEAR DAO to authorise the foundation to engage in any transactions authorised by a DAO resolution, regardless of whether the foundation was specifically mentioned in such resolutions.\n\n**By adopting this resolution, the GEAR DAO authorises the Gearbox Foundation to:**\n\n1. Carry out any deals, operations, and transactions approved by a DAO resolution, including GIPs (the “Transactions”), in such manner and to the extent as the foundation may, in consultation with relevant DAO contributors, consider necessary, advisable, and/or appropriate. This applies whether the Transaction was approved before or after today and whether or not the foundation is mentioned in the relevant DAO resolution;\n\n2. Engage in and perform any such Transaction if it is considered a “DAO reserved matter” under the Gearbox Foundation’s Memorandum & Articles of Association. Approval of such Transaction by a DAO resolution shall constitute the GEAR DAO’s consent to the foundation engaging in (and dealing with) all relevant DAO reserved matters, without needing further authorisation;\n\n3.  Enter into legal agreements and other documents related to any Transaction, and make any necessary amendments thereto. The terms of such agreements and documents must not conflict with the terms set out in the relevant DAO resolution;\n\n4. Upon an instruction by the GEAR DAO or request by a relevant counterparty, modify, terminate, or transfer legal agreements and documents concluded by the foundation and/or associated rights or obligations, provided that such actions do not conflict with the terms set out in the applicable DAO resolutions; and\n\n5.  If a DAO resolution establishes a specific initiative (like a program or project), the Gearbox Foundation can carry out any transactions it deems appropriate or advisable to implement that initiative, after consulting with relevant DAO contributors, regardless of whether the foundation was specifically authorised or directed to engage therein. Unless otherwise established by an applicable DAO resolution, any such transaction by the foundation will be considered approved by the GEAR DAO.\n\n### III. Approval of Certain Transactions\n\n#### 1. Chaos Labs Transaction:\nIn [GIP-116](https://snapshot.org/#/gearbox.eth/proposal/0x0a96b8d35bc520cc16dc18facc99e78f59ac0c57a6a2a611c8a4a148ebc81bbb), the DAO resolved to engage Chaos Labs and determined specific engagement terms for this transaction. \n\nAs we approached the agreement execution stage, we discovered some discrepancies in the fee amounts set out in the DAO resolution, due to which we were unable to identify the genuine intent of the DAO regarding this specific transaction. Upon consulting with the appropriate DAO contributors, we have clarified the actual terms of the transaction and are therefore asking for the DAO’s authorisation to engage Chaos Labs and/or associated entities on the terms set forth below, with other terms to be as the foundation may, in consultation with relevant DAO contributors, deem appropriate, reasonable or advisable:\n\n**- Fees:**\n   * If the Gearbox protocol’s average TVL for the calendar month preceding the quarter (“TVL”) is below $250M, the quarterly payment will be 50K USDC and $50K worth of GEAR tokens; \n   * If the Gearbox protocol’s TVL is between $250M and $750M, the quarterly payment will be 62.5K USDC and $62.5K worth of GEAR tokens;\n   * If the Gearbox protocol’s TVL is above $750M, the quarterly payment will be 75K USDC and $75K worth of GEAR tokens.\n\n**- Other essential terms:**\n   * A two-year contract term, renewal permitted; \n   * An extra 1/2 of the quarterly payment (based on the current TVL) is payable upfront, together with the first quarterly payment, and will be applied as a credit towards the last quarterly payment under the agreement.\n   * Throughout the engagement term, Chaos Labs will directly determine, establish, and modify risk parameters (the “Risk Parameters”) within the Gearbox protocol and its liquidity pools to optimise and improve their performance. **You can find list of these \"Risk Parameters\" [here](https://www.notion.so/gearboxprotocol/GIP-138-Risk-Parameters-d1cf0b28a4384d03801a7153c847e8da).

      "title": "[GIP-133]: Onboard crvUSD pool",
      "content": "Author: @apeir99n , @DeSnake \n\n# Summary\nThis proposal aims to request Gearbox DAO approval to deploy crvUSD pool and corresponding credit manager.\n\n# Motivation\ncrvUSD is one of the leading decentralized CDP stablecoins expressing steadily growing DeFi adoption. It is fully overcollateralized, having quality assets as collateral (check here).\nThe stickiness of stablecoin investors’ preferences as a rationale for onboarding new tokens has been discussed in GIP-103 (https://snapshot.org/#/gearbox.eth/proposal/0xd34a15dbff6660c981184ae0fb83d4e094e3e9e50d7bfe39ab641c9e05642869) when GHO, USDT and DAI were onboarded to Gearbox. Such an approach has shown itself to be efficient and onboarding crvUSD is perceived to be a natural next step in this direction. \nMoreover, this pool will be mutually seeded by Gearbox and Curve community with GEAR and CRV incentives as outlined in GIP-122 (https://snapshot.org/#/gearbox.eth/proposal/0x531b373f1acd65fde928a6022ae7575478b43d91673bfa7353513c959f7575e4).\n\n# Technical specification\nOnly Tier 1 credit manager is proposed to be deployed. Later it will also be possible to add some curve/convex pools, however, given the almost zero utilization of them in the USDC pool, now we suggest to don’t complicate deployment. Parameters of the deployment will closely resemble those which are implemented for GHO token.\n\n## Liquidity sources\n 1) 6 million USDT can be sold into crvUSD with 0.48% price impact in Curve crvUSD/USDT pool\nhttps://curve.fi/#/ethereum/pools/factory-crvusd-1/\n 2) 7 million USDC can be sold into crvUSD with 0.41% price impact through Curve crvUSD/USDC pool\nhttps://curve.fi/#/ethereum/pools/factory-crvusd-0/\n 3) 7 million DAI can be sold into crvUSD with 0.41% price impact through Curve 3pool and pools mentioned above\nhttps://curve.fi/#/ethereum/pools/3pool/\n 4) 10 million USDe can be sold into crvUSD with 0.88% price impact through Curve USDe/crvUSD\nhttps://curve.fi/#/ethereum/pools/factory-stable-ng-11/\n 5) 7 million sUSDe can be sold into crvUSD using Curve via sUSDe - sDAI - DAI - USDC - crvUSD route.\nNote: sUSDe liquidity calculations in other pools rely on sUSDe - sDAI pool, but currently this pool allows selling 21 million sUSDe with 0.7% slippage, which is enough for cumulative exposure.\nhttps://curve.fi/#/ethereum/pools/factory-stable-ng-102/ \n## Pool quotas\n| Asset | Proposed limit | Proposed minRate | Proposed maxRate |\n| ----- | -------------- | ---------------- | ---------------- |\n| USDC  | 10000000       | 0.0004           | 0.12             |\n| USDT  | 10000000       | 0.0004           | 0.12             |\n| DAI   | 10000000       | 0.0004           | 0.12             |\n| sDAI  | 10000000       | 0.0005           | 0.15             |\n| USDe  | 5000000        | 0.0005           | 0.5              |\n| sUSDe | 2000000        | 0.0005           | 0.5              |\n\n## Interest rate curve\nIt is proposed to use the same parameters as for USDC pool.

      "content": "Author: [Biaf from Idle](https://x.com/biafffff)\n(Posted by amplice on behalf of Idle)\n\n### Summary\n\nA proposal to discuss and approve a GEAR incentives program for the [Idle's](https://idle.finance/) Yield Tranches on top of the USDC and WETH passive yield markets. \n\n### Motivation\n\nIdle has deployed two Yield Tranches (YTs) on top of the Gearbox’s USDC and WETH markets. [The Yield Tranche primitive](https://docs.idle.finance/products/yield-tranches/overview) offers a risk-adjusted lending experience with its Senior and Junior mechanisms:\n\n* Senior LPs can benefit from funds coverage by withholding and routing part of the base yield to the Junior counterparty\n* Junior LPs can enjoy boosted yield, but give exit priority to Senior LPs in case any loss affects the lending pool\n\nThis solution lets users pick their preferred side based on their risk appetite and offers a more risk-tailored investment.\n\nGearbox and Idle have been in discussions about ways to collaborate and get the most out of this product launch. One idea that has emerged is to incentivize LPs by distributing on-top rewards to the Senior side of each tranche during the liquidity formation phase (LFP).\n\nTo have a fair distribution, Gearbox DAO will distribute GEAR incentives, while Idle DAO will match the incentives in either USDC or WETH (depending on the pool). The rewards campaign will have different tiers and will be distributed in the form of weekly airdrops to the LPs’ wallet addresses. This way the distribution won’t be blind, but conditional to the liquidity collected. Specifically:\n\n* Tier 1: Up to $500,000 in Senior liquidity, with a target Senior net yield of 10%\n* Tier 2: Up to $1,000,000 in Senior liquidity, with a target Senior net yield of 9%\n* Tier 3: Up to $2,000,000 in Senior liquidity, with a target Senior net yield of 8%\n\nAs of today, with GEAR at $0.02, Gearbox DAO monthly budget should be at most ~200k GEAR (the equivalent of ~$4k). The full rewards simulation can be found in this [file](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Wb88frrbDzus8QGx5qNF7PDrajxbt-LGSO_WrkOLjVU/edit?usp=sharing). \n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreia4alohwikh4a7jjyu4dsz5illvj2lst5nk47cgt6fzccn5rvtiuy)\n    \n### Specification\n\n* [USDC Yield Tranches contract](https://etherscan.io/address/0xdd4d030a4337ce492b55bc5169f6a9568242c0bc) 0xdd4D030A4337CE492B55bc5169F6A9568242C0Bc\n* [WETH Yield Tranches contract](https://etherscan.io/address/0xbc48967C34d129a2ef25DD4dc693Cc7364d02eb9) 0xbc48967C34d129a2ef25DD4dc693Cc7364d02eb9\n* The rewards campaign should last for 1 month and can later be extended for 2 months more depending on Gearbox DAO preferences. The maximum length of the rewards campaign thus will be 3 months.\n* Weekly airdrop to LPs’ wallets. \n* Gearbox DAO can transfer the GEAR budget to the Idle’s Treasury League multisig which will manage the weekly distribution with a `disperse` call.\n* The weekly distribution will be reported in [the file shared above](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Wb88frrbDzus8QGx5qNF7PDrajxbt-LGSO_WrkOLjVU/edit?usp=sharing). \n\nFrom a security perspective, the Yield Tranche codebase has been live on mainnet since September 2021 and never suffered any hack or unexpected loss for LPs. It was [audited 4 times](https://docs.idle.finance/developers/security/audits#yield-tranches). Most recently in October 2023.",

One idea that has emerged is to give liquidity support to Idle during the liquidity formation phase (LFP).\n\nBy depositing part of its treasury on the Senior side, Gearbox DAO can earn a covered yield as well as create room to onboard new Junior liquidity. \n\nAdditionally, this liquidity will be counted as part of the [Integrators program](https://docs.idle.finance/products/get-involved/integrators-program) and generate extra yield for the DAO to reinvest in other activities or increase its reserve fund.\n\n### Specification\n\n* [USDC Yield Tranches contract](https://etherscan.io/address/0xdd4d030a4337ce492b55bc5169f6a9568242c0bc) 0xdd4D030A4337CE492B55bc5169F6A9568242C0Bc\n* [WETH Yield Tranches contract](https://etherscan.io/address/0xbc48967C34d129a2ef25DD4dc693Cc7364d02eb9) 0xbc48967C34d129a2ef25DD4dc693Cc7364d02eb9\n* The treasury deployment should last for at least **3 months** and can later be extended or ended based on Gearbox DAO preferences. \n* This liquidity deployment would generate an extra 3% yield for the DAO as part of the Integrators program. Depending on the size of the referred TVL, the fee rebate can double up to 6%.\n* Senior USDC tranche referral link \\\napp.idle.finance/#/earn/0x450C055a00226F1Eba09E8D9627034565b7C4C8A?_referral=0x7b065Fcb0760dF0CEA8CFd144e08554F3CeA73D1\n* Senior WETH tranche referral link \\\napp.idle.finance/#/earn/0x0f09A04AD551Dd941b589625BD2360FC962FF9f7?_referral=0x7b065Fcb0760dF0CEA8CFd144e08554F3CeA73D1\n\nFrom a security perspective, the Yield Tranche codebase has been live on mainnet since September 2021 and never suffered any hack or unexpected loss for LPs. It was [audited 4 times](https://docs.idle.finance/developers/security/audits#yield-tranches). Most recently in October 2023.\n\nGearbox token holders can use this [file](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Wb88frrbDzus8QGx5qNF7PDrajxbt-LGSO_WrkOLjVU/edit?usp=sharing) to simulate the yield generated on Junior by a Senior deposit.\n\n#### Note that this proposal uses approval voting (in order to make reaching quorum on at least one option more likely).\n\nDAO participants should vote for all options that are acceptable (if you are OK with Gearbox depositing 100k and/or 150k into both Idle pools, vote for both 100k and 150k.)",

      "content": "## Author: \n@apeir99n \n\n## Summary\nThis proposal aims to increase sUSDE limits for stable pools.\n\n\n## Motivation\n\nCurrently, the Quota usage for sUSDe has reached ~100% for all stablepools (you can check historical usage [here](https://dune.com/desnakeee/gearbox-quota-utilization)). Taking into account 30%+ organic yield on sUSDe seems it's a good option to increase utilization and organic supply rate for Gearbox pools. \n\nIt is important to note that Gearbox now has a ~52M position in USDe and ~15M position in sUSDe, while on-chain liquidity allows to sell ~95M USDe with 1% slippage: see order routing image below. Though not all these liquidity sources are available on gearbox, the available pools have sufficiently deep liquidity and, if something happens, arbitrage will be carried out with all the available on-chain liquidity. In this regard, it seems that increasing the limits is safe. It should be noted also that gearbox uses market price oracles for USDe, therefore, in the case of USDe depeg, liquidation of Credit Accounts may create negative selling pressure. However, the current ratio of proposed quota limits and amount of on-chain liquidity (approx. 1:1) should be sufficient to avoid negative scenarios. \n\n\n## Specification\n\nWe propose the following changes:\n1) Increase sUSDe quota limit in USDC pool to 15M USDC\n2) Increase sUSDe quota limit in USDT pool to 5M USDC\n3) Increase sUSDe quota limit in DAI pool to 5M USDC\n4) Increase sUSDe quota limit in GHO pool to 5M USDC\n\n## Transaction log\nTransaction log can be found [here](https://gearboxprotocol.notion.site/GIP-131-7eab7b4382f149d9a0dd492e02f5921b?pvs=4), md5 checksum is 912bff199431d79139da6ac07dfcf7a3. \n\n## Voting\nSimple Approve/Reject",

      "content": "## Author: \n@DeSnake  @apeir99n \n\n## Summary\nThis proposal aims to change risk parameters for v3 Mainnet deployment.\n\n## Motivation\nWhile we witnessed quick growth of protocol’s TVL and utilization, most of this growth was induced by very few use cases. Particularly, \nWETH pool contributes to ~64% of total supply and borrowing\nUSDC pool contributes to ~27% of total supply and borrowing\nUSDT and DAI pools together contribute to 7% of total supply and borrowing\nGHO pool contributes to 1.5% of total supply and borrowing\nWBTC pool contributes to 0.5% of total supply and borrowing\nAt the same time all WETH utilization is induced by LRT leveraging, and 93% of stablecoin pools utilization is driven by leveraging USDe and sUSDe (see charts below).\n\n### References:\nhttps://dune.com/p_dot/gearbox-v3-pools for pool-wise supply and borrow usage\nhttps://dune.com/queries/3499396/5884967 for quota usage across all credit accounts\nhttps://dune.com/desnakeee/gearbox-quota-utilization for pool-wise quota usage\n\nThis evidence makes us consider decreasing quotas for unused tokens.

LT parameters change should be done via ramping procedure, that means new parameters will be  linearly changed over the duration of 14 days.\n\nThe rationale behind zeroing yvWETH, yvUSDC, yvWBTC limits is as follows:\n\n1. 80% of yvWETH is backed by stETH which pays 3.6% APR, another 20% is backed by lent WETH which earns no more than 1.6% APR. This makes its APR to be less than return of holding stETH.\n2. yvUSDC currently allocated 100% of underlying USDC to lending protocols, which yield 6-7% on average, making it non competitive compared to other strategies possible on Gearbox.\n3. yvWBTC historically had less than 0.2% average return which is negligibly small.\n\nMoreover, none of yv- assets were historically utilized on Gearbox v3, which one more time reasons the possibility of setting limits to zero.\n\nReasons to zero stkcvxcrvUSDFRAX-f limit are as follows:\n\n1. Not only its return is not competitive in current market conditions (~6.5% APR), but it is sufficiently smaller than the yield of comparable strategies, namely stkcvxcrvUSDC and stkcvxcrvUSDT paying 9.8% and 12.7% APR respectively.\n2. Moreover it has the least TVL compared to stkcvxcrvUSDC and stkcvxcrvUSDT pools ($785k vs $13M and $12M), which means that its return will be even more diluted after any somewhat big deposit.\n\nIt’s proposed to lower LTs for LDO, LINK, MKR, UNI, CRV, CVX to make it even more safe than it was necessary historically. These assets and price feeds are pretty reliable, but this kind of overly safe parameters will allow us to focus on the most utilized use cases fine-tuning.\n\n### Liquidation premium\n\nWe propose to change liquidation premium to 5% for following Credit Managers: Trade USDC Tier2, Trade USDC Tier3, Trade WETH Tier 2, Trade WETH Tier 3, Restaking WETH, Farm WETH, Trade WBTC Tier 2, Trade WBTC Tier 3.\n\nThe liquidation premium determines how much compensation the liquidator will receive for closing a position with a low health factor. It is worth considering that the size of the liquidator’s profit is determined not only by the Credit Account’s Total Value and liquidation premium, but also by some external parameters:\n\n- Price impact for selling collateral tokens to underlying is covered by liquidator\n- Difference between spot and oracle price is covered by liquidator\n\nThe latter is especially relevant due to transition LRTs to fundamental oracles (see [GIP-126](https://snapshot.org/#/gearbox.eth/proposal/0x69a0caf6bd43fc575419246c4596f604c2961d6a9ff6289d7282abd9042e119e)) since in the case of short-term depeg liquidations can be blocked if depeg more than liquidation premium. Despite the fact that the current parameters are quite safe for Tier2,3 Credit Managers, liquidity for longer tail assets are not deep (especially taking into account Uni V3 design, when if price drops fast, there is very low liquidity in some ticks). Therefore, it seems rational to make the parameters more secure, given that this is not the main use case of the protocol.\n\n## Transaction log\nTransaction log can be found [here](https://gearboxprotocol.notion.site/GIP-130-6edcec7f44c04d218f1fee54ac0dec4b?pvs=4), md5 checksum is 2d9f7543a8906529373cd9c852fd3e67. \n\n## Voting\n\nSimple Approve/Reject",

We also propose to allow pufETH, which was previously forbidden due to an issue with pufETH contracts.\n\n## Motivation\nCurrently the technical multisig has the ability to increase rsETH and weETH limits up to the caps defined in GIP-117, but only when current quota utilization exceeds 90% of the current limit. \n\nAs weETH and rsETH now both have fundamental price feeds (rsETH fundamental feed transaction is queued and will be executed by Friday evening) and decent on-chain liquidity, the risk committee believes that their limits can be safely raised to much larger values.\n\npufETH was previously forbidden by the SC initiative team (meaning no new pufETH positions could be opened) due to an issue with pufETH contracts. The issue has since been rectified by the Puffer team and pufETH position opening can be re-enabled.\n\n## Specification\nWe propose the following changes:\n1) Increase weETH/WETH quota limit to 30k WETH;\n2) Increase rsETH/WETH quota limit to 10k WETH;\n3) Allow rsETH/WETH 0.05% UniswapV3 pool in the UniswapV3 adapter, for Restaking WETH Credit Manager;\n4) Remove forbidden status from pufETH in the Restaking WETH Credit Manager;\n\n## Transaction log\nTransactions can be found [here](https://gearboxprotocol.notion.site/GIP-129-d9b66adefb69454c843596bba448c5b4?pvs=4).\n\n## Timeline\nTransactions will be queued immediately after voting end if it succeeds, and will be executed after a normal 36 hour timelock.",

      "title": "[GIP-128] Amended Compensation for ezETH Borrowers Liquidated during Emergency Pause",
      "content": "### Author: amplice\n\n## Summary\n\nUpdate: Due to incorrect information in the previous spreadsheet included in [GIP-127](https://snapshot.org/#/gearbox.eth/proposal/0x405c8023da81128a3ee3afb5c0bcb1f0f0a545b8c33dfeb6250d17fa1650ab62), voters were encouraged to reject the previous proposal in favor of a new one with corrected numbers. \n\nIn addition to this, there was some discussion in discord about what the DAO should do here - compensate all users who were liquidated, or focus only on those who were liquidated after the emergency pause, as well as some discussion about the method of distribution. Therefore we will use approval voting (where you can vote for multiple options) to see the DAO's preference whilst still reaching quorum. A reminder to DAO participants - the **winning** option must have at least 200m GEAR votes.\n\n## Motivation\n\nIn order to get the full context of this proposal, [we recommend all DAO participants first read GIP-127.](https://snapshot.org/#/gearbox.eth/proposal/0x405c8023da81128a3ee3afb5c0bcb1f0f0a545b8c33dfeb6250d17fa1650ab62)\n\nThis proposal is an amendment of GIP-127. The intent is the same - to partially compensate users affected by the liquidations caused by ezETH depeg event. \n\nThe original proposal was focused on users who were liquidated during the emergency pause, however some of the data included in the proposal was incorrect. Thus this amended proposal is necessary.\n\nFurthermore, since there is some contention within the governance discord about exactly which users should be compensated and how the distributions should work, Gearbox DAO as a whole will decide the best way to proceed here by offering multiple choices using [approval voting methodology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Approval_voting).\n\nFirst of all, the final proper calculation of the emergency pause liquidator fees is 156.68 + 81.96 - 25.77 = 212.87 ETH. The other 22.48 ETH were made from liquidations that were outside of the emergency pause scope, so technically, those do not have to be distributed. However, the idea is not to cheap out on users but instead use the profits to cover the scope. Again, there is no requirement to do it, but caring about users is a good idea. As a result, 235.35 ETH was voted on for distribution.\n\nHave to note that those who were liquidated before the pause (meaning they could have topped up their positions with more collateral or closed themselves) are not in the scope of this proposal and the distribution, as has been communicated at all times. Given that some disagree, the vote below can include these users, too.\n\n## Proposal Specification\n\n[The spreadsheet with new data is here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/119usnEsM9hB_vBPAQEVZBjJpCE3u5x83Ow35csW_1mg/edit#gid=916540490). \nIn the spreadsheet, the amounts in the column displaying \"Option 1\" corresponds to 1) below. The amounts in the column displaying \"Option 2\" corresponds to 2) below.  The spreadsheet shared in [GIP-127](https://snapshot.org/#/gearbox.eth/proposal/0x405c8023da81128a3ee3afb5c0bcb1f0f0a545b8c33dfeb6250d17fa1650ab62) corresponds to 3) below.\n\n1) Approve, socialize losses: 235.35 ETH is distributed pro rata to user losses. Losses in this case are computed as: how much a user would have had left if they closed the account on their own one block before liquidation. Only for users liquidated during pause.\n\n2) Approve, don't socialize losses: 235.35 ETH is distributed proportional to liquidation premium. The users will get exactly the liquidator's profit on their liquidation, scaled up so that the total sum is still 235.35. Only for users liquidated during pause.\n\n3) Approve spreadsheet included in [GIP-127]: compensate every liquidated user that night regardless of whether it was during the pause or not, pro rata based on user losses.\n\n4) Reject any compensation\n\n### Rationale\nThe first version of this proposal included some incorrect data so DAO participants were broadly encouraged to reject it in favor of an amended proposal (this one). \n\nAt the same time, there was some discussion in the discord about whether this proposal should only cover users who were liquidated during the emergency pause, or whether it should include all users who were liquidated due to this depeg event, as well as some discussion about the exact method of distribution (pro rata based on losses or based on actual liquidation premium profit earned on specific credit accounts). Therefore, this proposal includes multiple options.\n\n## Implementation\nFunds will be sent directly to affected wallets.",

      "content": "### Author: amplice\n\n## Summary\nPartly compensate users who were liquidated during the ezETH depeg event while the Gearbox Protocol was in an emergency paused state, using the profits earned by the protocol from these liquidations. [Full context is available here](https://blog.gearbox.fi/p/f5c902a8-9668-4dbe-bec1-2b1d811b1f17/)\n\nRepeating this precedent wouldn’t be smart. Don’t expect this to repeat in the future. Leverage comes with risks, borrowers now have full understanding of the system. DYOR.\n\n## Motivation\nRecently, the ezETH liquid restaking token suffered a depeg event relative to the price of ETH. In response to this unusual activity, Gearbox's risk management systems automatically triggered an emergency pause of the entire protocol. This was an important precautionary measure in case the price fluctuations were due to a potential smart contract exploit.\n\nHowever, this emergency pause also had the unintended consequence of preventing some users from being able to add more collateral to their positions and avoid liquidation. While it was technically possible for users to send additional collateral directly to their Credit Account addresses, many were likely unaware of this option.\n\nAs a result, some users were liquidated during the pause period who may otherwise have been able to avoid liquidation by increasing their collateral. Gearbox Protocol was still able to handle these liquidations as intended and did not suffer any bad debt, instead realizing a profit.\n\n#### Liquidation Event Details\nThe relevant financial details from the ezETH depeg liquidations are as follows:\n\nInterest rate fees collected: 45 ETH\nLiquidation fees: 90 ETH\nLiquidation downside: 25 ETH\nPremium captured by emergency liquidators: 170 ETH\n\nIn total, the protocol earned a profit of 235 ETH from this event (170 + 90 - 25). An additional ~2 ETH was earned on Arbitrum.\n\nThe 45 ETH from interest collected is not included here as it has no real relation to the liquidations.\n\n## Proposal Specification\nUse a portion of the profits earned by Gearbox from liquidations during the emergency pause to partially compensate affected users. Based on numbers, see the files in Discord for the precise calculations, such users could expect ~20% of the initial funds to be recouped. The numbers could vary from user to user based on what the price of a liquidation was.\n\nThis compensation would be funded by the ~235 ETH profit earned by Gearbox during this ezETH depeg event. Individual reimbursement amounts would be calculated based on on-chain liquidation data. There won’t be any need to claim, it will be multi-sent directly.\n\n### Rationale\nWhile the emergency pause functionality worked as intended to protect the protocol, it had the side effect of preventing some users from saving their positions who likely would have otherwise.\n\nIt therefore seems appropriate that we use a portion of the profits from these liquidations to compensate them for this. Going further, there are already plans being voted on, as well as upcoming improvements, that you can check in the blog and vote on in the respective proposals. [See our blog post here for more information.](https://blog.gearbox.fi/p/f5c902a8-9668-4dbe-bec1-2b1d811b1f17/)\n\n## Implementation\nSee below spreadsheet for the compensation amounts.\n\nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1KXSnEgi7MM1_t3-fdkZjaUratC7gIk_EL8tXQaSphjY/edit?usp=sharing\n\nFunds will either be sent directly or a claim page will be set up.",

      "title": "[GIP-126] Reassesment of risk parameters for LRTs",
      "content": "## Author\n\napeir99n\n\n## Summary\n\n_Note: this proposal is in an optimistic format. This means that transactions to change parameters will be queued before voting ends. If the vote succeeds, transactions will be executed immediately after; if it fails, pending transactions will be canceled._\n\nThis proposal aims to gradually ramp non-withdrawable LRT’s LT to a lower value more aligned with the asset’s actual risk as well as set fundamental oracle for LRTs with enabled withdrawal.\n\n## Ramping LTs for non-withdrawable LRTs\n\nThe April 24th depeg of ezETH has demonstrated that the current LT of 91.5% is too aggressive - at the lowest point of the depeg, some lossy liquidations occurred. Even though they were fully covered programmatically by the Reserve Fund, this must not happen with correct risk parameters, and thus ezETH’s LT needs to be reassessed. The same logic is applicable for other LRTs not having enabled withdrawals: pufETH, rswETH.\n\nGiven that consecutive price deviation for ezETH during depeg was ~9%, safe LT should be set to 87% (here we take into account 3% liquidation premium and 1% liquidation fee for Restaking Credit Manager). At the same time, reducing the LT immediately will likely make a lot of existing accounts unhealthy, and hence we propose to use the \\`rampLiquidationThreshold\\` in Credit Configurator to reduce the LT linearly over the duration of 7 days. This will give existing holders sufficient time to reduce their leverage in line with the new LT.\n\nSimilarly I suggest to set LT for pufETH and rswETH equal to 87% as these LRTs don’t have enabled withdrawals as well.\n\nFor weETH, rsETH it is suggested to keep current LT as weETH already has withdrawals, while rsETH will [launch it](https://x.com/KelpDAO/status/1783434984356770189) on 3 May.\n\n## Fundamental oracles for weETH / ezETH / rsETH / pufETH / rswETH\n\nThere are various designs of oracles for lending markets:\n\n\\- market ones, which aggregate prices on various exchanges\n\n\\- fundamental ones, which calculate the value of locked assets\n\n\\- fixed ones (for example, in some lending markets USDe price is hardcoded as 1).\n\nWe at Gearbox have always preferred to use market oracles, which allow us to be the first to liquidate risky positions in the event of various events, thereby protecting the passive side. However, as we can see in the ezETH case, such a design can, on the contrary, create potential problems for LPs: with a sharp drop in price and liquidity crunch, liquidators will close positions fixing losses for the passive side and creating bad debt. Fortunately this scenario did not materialize, but nevertheless it requires to switch approaches. We propose to remove such risks by using a fundamental oracle. In this case, the oracle will broadcast the price of the actually locked funds, and even if a short-term depeg occurs, fundamentally arbitrageurs will be able to back the peg in the worst case in 7 days. At the same time, the fundamental oracle will reflect the price change, for example, which may occur in the event of a future slashing events in EigenLayer.\n\nFundamental oracles will be prepared by Redstone in 1-2 weeks, and we propose to implement the change once they are ready without additional voting.\n\nWe also propose to move market-based price feeds to reserve (LRT withdrawals will then be based on \\`p = min(P_fundamental, P_market)\\`) and decrease ControllerTimelockV3 delay from 8 hours to 1 hour for \\`setReservePriceFeed\\` policy.\n\nThese changes essentially allow the 4/12 technical multisig to switch the price feed from Main to reserve in 1 hour. Proposal suggests give permission to Technical multisig to apply this switch in case of unrecoverable depeg event.\n\n## Voting\n\nSimple Approve / Reject",

      "title": "[GIP-125] Enabling partial liquidations through bots",
      "content": "## Author\n\nvan0k, 0xmikko, apeir99n\n\n## Summary\n\n_Note: this proposal is in an optimistic format. This means that transactions to deploy and connect partial liquidation bots will be queued before voting ends. If the vote succeeds, transactions will be executed immediately after; if it fails, pending transactions will be canceled._\n\nThis proposal aims to deploy the PartialLiquidationBotV3 contract and connect it as a special permissions bot for all current Credit Managers, which will enable partial liquidations. We also propose to gradually ramp ezETH’s LT to a lower value more aligned with the asset’s actual risk as well as changing debt limits on Arbitrum.\n\n## Overview\n\nThe recent ezETH depeg has demonstrated the need to minimize the selling pressure when liquidating accounts. Due to the current core contracts only allowing liquidations of CA’s entire debt, significantly more ezETH were sold off than required to bring the affected accounts back into health. This caused undue losses for users who were basically forced to sell their entire positions at low price / with high slippage, and also contributed to the imbalancing of on-chain ezETH pools.\n\nAfter the depeg, on-chain liquidity remains limited, which can complicate or even outright prevent successful liquidations of remaining ezETH accounts.\n\nTo improve this going further, we propose to deploy the [PartialLiqudiationBotV3](https://github.com/Gearbox-protocol/bots-v3/blob/main/contracts/bots/PartialLiquidationBotV3.sol) contract ([audited by Mixbytes](https://github.com/Gearbox-protocol/security/blob/f18914f2b7066bff7e13231a1396fe589e820496/audits/2024%20Apr%20-%20MixBytes_Gearbox_Bots_Integrations_V3.pdf)) and assign it a special permissions bot status in all existing Credit Managers. This will enable liquidators to partially liquidate unhealthy accounts by purchasing just enough collateral at a discount to bring an account back to health - thus significantly reducing selling pressure from liquidations and allowing to keep CAs healthy even with current limited liquidity, while also minimizing losses for users.\n\n## PLB technical details\n\n_To better understand this section, basic knowledge of Gearbots is recommended. You can find a detailed explanation_ [_here_](https://medium.com/gearbox-protocol/gearbox-ux-meet-the-gearbots-16b4885997db)_._\n\n### Partial liquidation bot logic\n\nPartialLiquidationBotV3 is a Gearbot contract that enables partial liquidations of accounts below a specified \\`minHealthFactor\\`. A partial liquidation is essentially a swap of some collateral asset on an unhealthy Credit Account for the liquidator’s underlying at the price equal to \\`oracle_price \\* (1 - liquidationPremium)\\`. The underlying received by the account is immediately used to partially repay CA’s debt.\n\nTo be precise, PLB performs the following sequence of actions:\n\n1. Applies price feed updates required to compute account’s health (this is only relevant for accounts that possess assets with Redstone pull oracles);\n2. Checks that the account is actually unhealthy (by comparing the account’s current HF against a \\`minHealthFactor\\` parameter);\n3. Computes the paid underlying amount given the requested collateral amount, or seized collateral amount given the underlying amount (this is the only difference between functions \\`liquidateExactDebt\\` and \\`liquidateExactCollateral\\`);\n4. Transfers underlying to the Credit Account;\n5. Calls the CreditFacadeV3’s botMulticall with following operations:\n    1. Decrease debt by the amount of underlying transferred minus the DAO’s liquidation fee;\n    2. Withdraw the liquidation fee to the treasury;\n    3. Withdraw the passed / computed amount of collateral to the \\`to\\` address specified by the liquidator;\n6. Ensures that the resulting health factor is above \\`minHealthFactor\\` and below \\`maxHealthFactor\\` (if this parameter is set).\n\nThe liquidator then disposes of received collateral at their discretion.\n\n_Note: The minimal debt requirements for Credit Accounts apply post partial liquidations. This means that a partial liquidation can only reduce an account’s debt to \\`minDebt\\`. If that is insufficient to restore an account to health, a full liquidation needs to be performed._\n\n### Deployed PLB configurations\n\nThe following configurations of PLB will be deployed:\n\n1. AP_PARTIAL_LIQUIDATION_BOT,\n\nminHealthFactor: 10_000,\n\nmaxHealthFactor: 65_535,\n\npremiumScaleFactor: 10_000,\n\nfeeScaleFactor: 10_000,\n\nspecial: true,\n\n1. AP_DELEVERAGE_BOT_PEGGED,\n\nminHealthFactor: 10_100,\n\nmaxHealthFactor: 10_250,\n\npremiumScaleFactor: 5_000,\n\nfeeScaleFactor: 5_000,\n\nspecial: false,\n\n1. AP_DELEVERAGE_BOT_LV,\n\nminHealthFactor: 10_400,\n\nmaxHealthFactor: 10_600,\n\npremiumScaleFactor: 5_000,\n\nfeeScaleFactor: 5_000,\n\nspecial: false,\n\n1. AP_DELEVERAGE_BOT_HV,\n\nminHealthFactor: 10_600,\n\nmaxHealthFactor: 11_000,\n\npremiumScaleFactor: 5_000,\n\nfeeScaleFactor: 5_000,\n\nspecial: false,\n\nWhere _minHealthFactor_ means below what value the bot can start de-leveraging a position (10_000 is equal to Health Factor 1), _maxHealthFactor_ means up to what value the bot can do de-leveraging of position, _special=true_ means bot will be compulsory for all Credit Accounts in the CM (if _false_, bot should be enabled by user manually). The compulsory bot charges the same premium and fee as full liquidations in respective Credit Managers, hence _premiumScaleFactor_ and _feeScaleFactor_ are set to 10_000 (i.e., 100%). For de-leveraging, there’s no need for such incentivization, so both premium and fee are reduced by 50%.\n\n## Change debt limits on Arbitrum\n\nBased on the results of the analysis of liquidations on Arbitrum, it was decided to change the size of credit accounts:\n\n|     | Min debt | Max debt |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| ETH Tier 1 | 2 WETH | 45 WETH |\n| ETH Tier 2 | 2 WETH | 15 WETH |\n| USDC Tier 1 | 5k USDC | 100k USDC |\n| USDC Tier 2 | 5k USDC | 25k USDC |\n\nThe logic behind changes in the lower bound is associated with increasing profitability for the liquidator, and the upper bound is associated with reducing price impact.\n\n## Voting\n\nSimple Approve / Reject",

      "title": "[GIP-124] Reserve Fund $1,000,000 level maintenance",
      "content": "### Authors: amplice & ivangbi\n\n## Summary\nProposing to float the reserve fund at around $1,000,000 until the treasury and audit commitments are covered, ensuring less risks for the treasury holdings and less exposure. The asset composition is to be at a semi-even ratio depending on what the asset composition is and what the pool size is. See more in https://docs.gearbox.finance/overview/liquidations/insurance-fund. \n\n## Motivation\nToken holder treasury is earning about $1M a month right now in hard assets (stables and ETH) which all go into the Reserve Fund by default, instead of idle assets like in most other protocols. This is because the reserve fund is made up of Gearbox diesel assets - or in other words, the fees accumulated in the reserve fund are actually deposits in Gearbox's lending pool. This is like re-supplying liquidity to keep growing the protocol - by default - while other protocols usually need to make a separate transaction to turn their idle assets into productive working LP positions. \n\nDue to recent GIPs having proposed improving security via Chaos Labs and Spearbit, it would be wise to provision a certain amount of funds to pay for these expenses. Such funds should not be subject to any risk at all, as a DAO we want to be able to say with 100% certainty that we can cover the costs of the new security tooling being onboarded to the ecosystem.\n\nThe $1,000,000 Reserve Fund level not increasing is NOT a bad security practice because it actually saves the assets from wrong liquidations tapping into the reserved fund at a bad moment. In cases where a tiny depeg is momentary, a large reserve fund is more of a liability than a blessing. In those cases it’s better to have idle assets to potentially cover any holes, rather than a mathematically programmed exposure.\n\n## Specification\nAt the current TVL of $400M, Reserve Fund is at about $1.5M and the proposal suggests to convert back protocol fees into hard assets to cover payments down to $1M. That is a non-material change because the reserve fund is the last stop anyway. In case the treasury would reach about +$3M in hard assets again, this proposal could be stopped, and the Reserve Fund could continue accruing more assets. Current distribution of Reserve Fund can be found here. It is proposed to set Reserve Funds distribution as 300k dUSDCv3, 200 dWETHv3, 30k dDAIv3 (and for smaller pools keep as is). \n\nThe financial multisig, if this proposal passes, would then once a month execute the withdrawal from dTokens from assets in order to keep each pool Reserve Fund at an even ratio to a pool’s total TVL as much as possible. Those assets are not to be used for anything, they would just sit idle in the same multisig as a non--immediately-burnable buffer. That’s all.\n\n## Next steps\nFinancial guard will execute the transaction as explained in the budget section right after.

      "title": "[GIP-123] Gearbox & Ether.fi Staking Frens Token Swap",
      "content": "#### Author: amplice\n\n## Summary\n\nGearbox and Ether.fi conduct a token swap + co-incentivization campaign called Staking Frens\n\n## Motivation\n\nGearbox and Ether.fi have been in discussions about ways to collaborate and grow our respective ecosystems together. One idea that has emerged is to conduct a mutually beneficial token swap and co-incentivization campaign called Staking Frens.\n\nThe concept is simple: we each contribute an equal dollar amount of our native tokens (GEAR and ETHFI) to each others DAOs. During the campaign period, new users who use either platform can claim a share of the partner project's tokens. This introduces each communities to the other's token utility and incentivizes participation and cross-pollination from both sides.\n\nIn addition, as a part of this collaboration, Ether.fi has offered to maintain Gearbox's 2x points status until the end of the Ether.fi points campaign in June. This is extremely important for Gearbox to maintain competitiveness with other projects that also allow for points farming on Ether.fi like Pendle.\n\nGiven the high gas fees on Ethereum L1, we propose to focus this campaign on an L2 network (probably Optimism). Gearbox just recently deployed to a couple of L2s, and Ether.fi will be live on various L2s shortly, so this campaign will also be a good way for both of us to build some excitement around these new deployments. This also helps ensures the incentives are not eaten up by transaction costs but actually end up going to our respective users.\n\nThe goal is to attract new restaking users and liquidity to both Gearbox and Ether.fi in an efficient, collaborative way by leveraging each other's communities.\n\n## Campaign Specification\n\nThe specific parameters of the proposed Staking Frens campaign are as follows:\n\n- Gearbox and Ether.fi will each contribute $70,000 worth of their native tokens (GEAR and ETHFI respectively) to each others DAOs\n- The campaign will run for 1 week, from April 29 - May 3, 2023\n- Only new users to either platform during the campaign period will be eligible to claim a share of the partner project's tokens - existing users will not receive these incentives\n- The tokens will be claimable on an L2 (probably Optimism) to minimize gas fees\n- The exact amount of tokens claimable per user will depend on the total number of unique participants - each project/DAO is free to distribute the tokens to new users as they feel is most appropriate\n- In the event that ETHFI token is not yet supported on the relevant L2 by the start of the campaign, Gearbox can send the GEAR tokens immediately, and - Ether.fi can send the ETHFI tokens once they are live on the L2 - Gearbox can distribute these to users as they feel is most appropriate.\n\nThere are several benefits to the proposed Staking Frens campaign structure:\n\n- Co-incentivization is an efficient use of each project's liquidity mining budget. By pooling our resources, we can offer more diversified incentives to end users.\n- Conducting the campaign on an L2 ensures that the rewards end up in the hands of users rather than being spent on gas. This is important for the program to be effective.\n- Focusing on new users specifically helps drive incremental growth rather than simply rewarding existing users. This is key to expanding TVL.\n- The campaign demonstrates a collaborative approach between two exciting DeFi projects, and both will be new deployments on an L2, which could allow us to get a shoutout/comarketing from whichever L2 is ultimately chosen.\n- Introducing our communities to each other's tokens expands awareness and potential future collabs between the projects.\n\nIn terms of the specific incentive amounts, $70,000 worth from each DAO represents a significant commitment from both projects, but is also in line with typical liquidity mining budgets. This amount is large enough to drive interest and participation, but small enough to not be a severe cost to Gearbox's treasury.\n\n## Next steps\n\nIf approved, Gearbox Financial multisig will allocate the necessary funds to carry out this campaign and DAO contributors will work towards making it happen. Gearbox will also maintain its 2x points status until the end of Ether.fi's points campaign.",

      "title": "[GIP-122]: Incentivizing a crvUSD Stablecoin Pool on Lending Side",
      "content": "### Author: amplice\n\n## Summary:\nIncentivize crvUSD stablecoin pool (if/when it is added) with GEAR to bootstrap initial liquidity into the pool.\n\n## Motivation\n\nOne of our goals at Gearbox is to grow TVL as large as possible, which means doing whatever we can to attract more DeFi users to either provide liquidity on the lending side, or use leverage on Gearbox (or both). The Curve ecosystem is one of the largest in DeFi, with a proven track record of being able to attract users. Curve's crvUSD is growing in popularity and is one of the largest decentralized stablecoins on the market at the moment. Given the instatiable demand we have seen for leverage on stablecoins (to use in our Ethena leveraged points strategy), it makes sense to add a crvUSD pool as a Gearbox lending pool asset, especially as Curve have expressed an interest in helping to bootstrap such a pool.\n\nCurve founder Michael Egorov has stated he will incentivize a crvUSD pool provided Gearbox matches the incentives that are provided. We believe with both sets of incentives + the extremely high demand we have seen for leverage on Ethena (points farming), these crvUSD passive pools could have market leading APYs, which means that it is likely that we will be able to attract a good amount of liquidity. This also helps our friends/partners at Curve increase adoption of crvUSD, so its a win-win scenario.\n\n## Technical specification\n\nThis incentivization period is initially planned for 3 months, and the initial goal for the size of the pool is roughly 10m. \n\nWe have proposed 4,500,000 GEAR (roughly $120k) as a starting point for incentives for this pool. Michael at Curve has agreed to additionally offer 265,000 of CRV, matching Gearbox DAO's incentives. Note that these numbers could change somewhat if token prices of either move drastically between now and deployment of the incentives, the basic idea is Curve and Gearbox provide (roughly) equal incentives in $ terms.\n\nWith a target TVL for the pool of 10m, 120k per quarter --> 480k annualized, or almost 5% APY. With Curve's matching incentives, that's roughly 10% APY of incentives over 3 months for the pool. This is on top of the strong organic yield that Gearbox has been able to offer on its stablecoin pools (fluctuating between 18-22%, right now averaging at about 20% across all pools).\n\nWe believe the combination of the risk profile of our lending pools +  ~20% organic APY + 10% additional incentives (at 10m TVL) makes this proposed new crvUSD pool extremely attractive to Curve ecosystem users and crvUSD holders. \n\nNote that this is an optimistic proposal that only executes if crvUSD is successfully onboarded as a lending asset in Gearbox. The technical details about pool implementation and risk parameters will be put forth in a separate proposal.\n\n## Next Steps\n\nCurve have also expressed an interest in doing some comarketing  around this pool and more broadly - this is a net positive for Gearbox as Curve is a trusted brand in DeFi that has been around for a long time and is also one of the most successful protocols out there.\n\nIf/when a crvUSD pool gets approved and added to Gearbox, this proposal will be executed upon.",

      "content": "## Author\n\nIntoTheBlock (ITB) Research\n\n## About ITB\n\nIntoTheBlock (ITB) was founded in 2019 and is one of the largest crypto data providers. Over the past three years, ITB  has been deeply involved in DeFi. Through our DeFi Quant Platform, we have helped 20+ of the largest crypto institutions deploy more than $1B in assets via sophisticated, non-custodial strategies aided by our risk management tools. \n\nThese strategies are tailored to each institution’s risk profile and would have not been possible without our extensive focus on risk management. Over the past year and a half we have spun off these risk-specific analytics through the Risk Radar product (https://defirisk.intotheblock.com/), partnering with protocols such as Aave, Curve Ethena and 10+ more.\n\n## Proposal\n\nThis proposal will create a dashboard of advanced economic risk indicators for Gearbox based on the risk signals ITB uses to protect deployed institutional assets. The proposed indicators found below will be freely available to the public on our Risk Radar platform and will allow Gearbox users to monitor risk signals pertaining directly or indirectly to the protocol in near-real time. The platform will also be accessed by ITB institutional clients who have allocated over $1B into DeFi using ITB risk management. The goal is to create transparency around Gearbox's risks and lead to greater confidence amongst allocators who value reviewing these metrics when deploying capital.\n\nTo pay for the cost of building the dashboard and risk models, ITB is requesting a $60k grant. Following discussions in the forum, we are requesting the grant to be paid in GEAR tokens, with 50% to be paid upfront and the remaining 50% upon completion of the dashboard, determining prices through a 7-Day TWAP.\n\nAdditionally, as Gearbox will be integrated into the ITB Quant strategies and we see the Gearbox protocol as a valuable addition to the DeFi ecosystem, we plan to be active providing input to governance proposals where we believe our background in risk management and capital deployment in DeFi will add value.\n\n## Relevant Links\nITB DeFi Quant Platform: https://intotheblock.finance/\nITB Risk Radar: https://defirisk.intotheblock.com/\nProposed Gearbox Risk Indicators: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18vEJKkEpNY2wzNbBWfVPTxCOYJSCp0NeWHyScP0M4a4/edit?usp=sharing",

      "title": "[GIP-120]: Gearbox Passive Lending Referral Program",
      "content": "## Objective\nEstablish a referral fee structure that generously rewards Gearbox's referral partners for driving TVL growth, while maintaining long-term sustainability for the protocol.\n\n## Background\n\nThe concept of integrating a referral program within DeFi protocols has proven to be a successful strategy for fostering growth and securing valuable partnerships. Our analysis of various models reveals a common practice of sharing between 10% and 50% of protocol revenue with referrers, often structured in tiers based on the amount of TVL referred.\n\nA survey of industry comparables shows:\n \n - Yearn offers tiered 10%-50% of performance fees to referrers - higher tiers are probably aspirational (50% if >1b referred), almost all referrers probably in the first 3 buckets (10%-20%) given Yearn total TVL.\n - Lido referrers earn 30% of Lido's fee share for referrals of up to 50k ETH (which is 185m). Scales up to 50% share for 700k ETH or higher (2.5b, so very high bar).\n - dYdX has a tiered structure from 20-40% of fees based on referrer's staked DYDX amount\n - Synthetix has a simple flat rate of 20% of protocol fees\n - Lyra has 3 tiers 10%, 20%, and 50%, but likely that most referrers fall into 20% bucket\n - GMX 5%-20% (with some tokenomics stuff)\n\nThe goal is to have an extremely competitive referral program whilst simultaneously minimising spend. Gearbox's current DAO revenues are very strong at 4-5% per year of TVL (~15m per year on ~$300M TVL) - because of the way Gearbox works, in current market conditions it has better “profit margins” than many other protocols. \n\nThis presents an opportunity to offer industry-leading referral incentives to accelerate growth by removing the current bottleneck, which is on the passive ending side.\n\n## Some Numbers\n\n### Yearn\n\nRefer to https://docs.yearn.fi/partners/introduction for details\n\nIf you referred 10m TVL to Yearn, according to their example:\n\nIf the Yearn strategy earned 10%, then the total gross yield was 1m\n\n20% performance fee = 200k\n\n45% goes to Yearn operational cost\n\n55% is shared between Yearn protocol and referrer/partner\n\n10m referred falls into the 20% tier.\n\nSo referrer would get 200k * 55% * 20% = 22k\n\n### Lido\n\nRefer to https://lido.fi/rewards-share for details\n\nLido fee structure is as follows:\n\nLido charges a 10% total fee on yield\n\nHalf goes to node operator, half to Lido, so 5%\n\nEth staking yield is ~4% right now.\n\nOn 10m worth of ETH\n\n400k yield\n\n40k split between node operator and Lido\n\n20k goes to Lido → 30% goes to referrer → referrer gets 6k\n\nThese two protocols are the most directly comparable to Gearbox, as they are places where you can simply deposit funds (as opposed to the other protocols shared above, where in order to generate referral fees, the referred users need to be active traders).\n\n## Proposal\n\nImplement a tiered referral fee structure that is attractive even at the lower levels, but also has higher tiers for any potential “super-referrers” (i.e other protocols or external businesses) that might be able to drive 8 figures of passive depositor funds to Gearbox.\n\nThe idea is that we are competitive with other referral programs for individual referrers who might drive mid-size depositors (1m-5m) to Gearbox.\n\nOn top of that, protocols, projects, and businesses that have the ability to drive large amounts of TVL should be very well rewarded for their efforts, as large deposits are much more impactful for Gearbox and also take potential referral partners a lot more work. For example, another DeFi protocol might need to build an entire vault strategy in order to attract 50m to Gearbox - this is more labor intensive than an individual referring to a friend who’s a whale.\n\n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreib7owortr4764ku4m5roxre5cjazmzi5y6o43faet6rg6z3zehkim)\n\n### Rationale\n\n20% base rate for projects is in-line with industry standards and sustainable for the protocol, and in dollar terms is extremely competitive with the closest comparables (5x Yearn, 10x Lido)\n\n40% referral fees are at the high end of industry range, and Gearbox’s natural profitability makes this very attractive for any entities that can refer large amounts of deposit funds\n\nIt is also likely that any 100m+ deposits that are referred would not have otherwise come to Gearbox if not for the referrer, whereas smaller depositors are likely substantially more nimble, and many of them might have ended up in Gearbox anyways thanks to the market-leading passive lending yields available there.\n\n### Math\n\n5m referred → 5% fee spread = 250k per year → 20% * 250k = $50k paid in referral\n30m referred → 5% fee spread = 1.5m per year → 30% * 1.5m = $450k paid in referral\n100m referred → 5% fee spread = 5m per year → 40% * 5000000 = $2m paid in referral\n\n### Implementation\nThis program would not be open to all - in order to avoid abuse, potential double counting, and other complications, from the protocol’s perspective it makes the most sense to limit the referral program to known entities.\n\nProspective referrers would need to ask for access to the program - once granted, they will receive a special referral link or code. For depositors to be tracked back to the referrer, they must use the link or code provided to the referrer by Gearbox DAO contributors. The full list of accepted referrers will be stored on a publicly available google sheets for full transparency (linked below)\n\nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1kQ0ul-GubV7FDOKKLzDcaMsP4FK6XRThT0hPmmpQXsU/edit#gid=0\n\nThe method of calculation is as follows:\n \n  - Regardless of what pool is used and what quotas are used, the lending pool’s revenue will be split between the DAO and the referrer\n - TVL will be calculated based on a moving average - for example, if payments are monthly (its likely they will either be monthly or quarterly), then we would calculate the referral TVL based on the average over the whole month, then use this figure to calculate the fee tier. This helps prevent gaming of the system (e.g referred user deposits 100m for 1 day and then withdraws).\n - Tiers will be based on total sum by referral code - meaning, if one referral partner refers 10 different users at 1m TVL each, and another referral partner refers a single user who deposits 10m, the two referral partners (ceteris paribus) would be treated exactly the same. \n - This program only applies to Gearbox’s passive lending pools (this is currently the primary bottleneck to growth), and applies on all chains where Gearbox is currently deployed.\n\n### Future Considerations\n\nDYDX and Lyra both have an interesting model of boosting the % of protocol revenue shared in cases where the referrer is staking the native token of the protocol. This is a potentially interesting addition to GEAR tokenomics, but in the short run is probably overly complex and not worth pursuing at the moment. In the future, perhaps we should re-explore this idea.\n\nIt’s also worth noting that the “spread” that the protocol earns can and will change over time depending on market conditions and the demand for leverage.\n\nIt’s also important for the protocol to be mindful of any feedback from existing and prospective referral partners. The DAO should ensure there is continual evaluation of the program's success and adjustments should be made to ensure it remains attractive to current and potential partners.",

      "title": "[GIP-116] Gearbox <> Chaos Labs Risk Management Partnership",
      "content": "## Summary\n\nThis post outlines the proposed scope of work for Chaos Labs as part of a Risk Management Partnership with the Gearbox core team and community. This partnership aims to minimize Gearbox’s risk exposure in volatile markets, deter economic assaults on the protocol, and ensure the secure conservation of user funds while promoting protocol growth. \n\nAt a high level, the partnership scope is comprised of three deliverables:\n\n- Parameter Optimizations\n- Gearbox Risk Portal\n- Mechanism Design Review\n\nThe proposed duration of the partnership spans 24 months, from June 2024 - June 2026.\n\n## About Chaos Labs\n\nChaos Labs is a market leader in risk management and optimization solutions for DeFi protocols. Our strategies are framed to safeguard protocol assets against manifold threats such as market volatility, black swan events, liquidity raids, and diverse instances of market manipulation. We meticulously craft strategies to ensure the resilient preservation of protocol assets, even under turbulent market conditions. \n\nOur methodology is predicated on a comprehensive approach aimed at fortifying protocols against systemic risks, accomplished through dynamic and contextually responsive risk parameter recommendations. We place an emphasis on the constant monitoring of positions and liquidity to optimize the performance of protocols amidst market fluctuations.\n\n## Partnership Scope\n\n### Parameter Optimizations\n\nAs part of our ongoing commitment to optimizing risk management for the Gearbox protocol, Chaos Labs will thoroughly analyze the protocol and build custom agent-based simulations. These simulations will leverage real-world protocol dynamics and on-chain behaviors to pressure test and optimize the protocol, identifying potential vulnerabilities and opportunities for improvement. By analyzing the system this way, we can gain a more comprehensive understanding of the factors that impact protocol health and stability, enabling us to make data-driven recommendations for optimization and risk management. These recommendations will be provided to the Gearbox team and community so they can digest and analyze the tradeoffs of different parameter sets on protocol risk and capital efficiency.\n\n### Gearbox Risk Portal\n\nThrough this engagement, the Gearbox community will get access to a publicly accessible platform to monitor and analyze protocol health. Through this platform, users can delve into specific scenarios in which the protocol could be negatively impacted and receive alerts concerning significant changes to on-chain activities that could pose a risk or detriment to the protocol's health.\n\nThe Chaos Labs Risk Monitoring Platform is continuously updated with additional features and enhancements. As part of our commitment to delivering a world-class risk management solution for the DeFi ecosystem, we constantly iterate and improve on the platform. The Gearbox community will gain continuous access to the newest feature additions and enhancements, allowing users to stay ahead of the curve and make informed decisions while optimizing their overall portfolio performance.\n\n### Mechanism Design Review\n\nAs Gearbox expands to new ventures and adds new risk levers, the Chaos Labs team will conduct a mechanism design review to ensure the financial security and efficiency of new features and services. To conduct a thorough, professional review of the economic design of novel DeFi mechanisms, the Chaos Labs research team examines the design documentation and code. As part of this engagement, Chaos Labs will embark on an exploratory study focused on the Gearbox mechanism design. The primary objective will be to review the design rules, protocols, and incentive structures that facilitate desired outcomes, ultimately ensuring Gearbox’s risk protection and growth. The aim is to devise mechanisms that align individual actor incentives with the collective objectives of the Gearbox protocol. \n\n![Screenshot 2024-04-11 at 15.46.50.png](ipfs://bafkreienp3ethquihgjjg6wmtul4nqqogphhomlb7g7tawkmpetspg5ora)\n\n## Pricing\nUnderstanding the phase at which Gearbox is, we propose a payment structure that will support the growth of the protocol; if Gearbox wins, Chaos wins. \n\nThe payment will be based on protocol TVL so that:\n**Below $250M TVL** \nQuarterly Payment: 25K USDC + 25K GEAR\nAnnual Amount: $400K (200K USDC + 200K GEAR)\n\n**Between $250M-750M TVL**\nQuarterly Payment: 31.25K USDC + 31.25K GEAR\nAnnual Amount: $500K (250K USDC + 250K GEAR)\n\n**Above $750M TVL**\nQuarterly Payment: 37.5K USDC + 37.5K GEAR\nAnnual Amount: $600K (300K USDC + 300K GEAR)\n\n**Additional Assets**\nThis proposal includes the evaluation and new asset recommendations of up to 60 new assets annually. Should additional new asset listing recommendations be required beyond 60 per year, the additional cost will be $3K USDC + $3K GEAR per asset.\n\n## Next Steps\nPending the approval of this proposal, Chaos Labs will commence this work by June 3rd, 2024.\n\n## Disclaimer\nChaos Labs has not been compensated by any third party for publishing this post.\n\n## Copyright\nCopyright and related rights waived via CC0\n\n## Legal Agreement\nIf necessary, Chaos Labs can sign legal agreement with Gearbox Foundation. The entity name/signators and other parameters Chaos Labs can specify directly with Gearbox Foundation.\n\n## Voting\nSimple Approve/Reject voting",

      "title": "[GIP-117]: Raising limit caps and changing LRT price feeds",
      "content": "### Author: van0k.eth\n\n## Summary\nThis proposal aims to raise the quota limit caps for most popular assets on Gearbox (namely, LRTs and Ethena), as well as modify the price feeds for LRTs to improve security and user experience.\n\n## Motivation\nThe technical multisig has currently reached all quota limit caps defined in previous GIPs for LRTs and USDe / sUSDe. This means that any further increases require a vote by the DAO. At the same time, liquidity for LRTs / Ethena Gearbox caps are steadily improving and demand for leverage of these assets remains strong.  As the passive lender side keeps growing, increasing limits will allow to both satisfy borrower demand and retain the industry-leading rates for lenders.\n\nAt the same time, Chainlink has recently onboarded weETH/ETH, ezETH/ETH and rsETH/ETH feeds. Gearbox currently uses ETH/USD as the reserve feed for LRT assets, which makes partial withdrawals complicated (as for partial withdrawal purposes LRTs are valued as plain ETH). Utilizing Chainlink oracles in addition to Redstone oracles will improve partial withdrawals and security of the system in respect to some of Gearbox's most popular assets.\n\n## Technical specification\n\n### Limits\nWe propose the following changes to quota limits and caps:\n\n**WETH Pool**\n| Asset | Current limit | New limit | New limit cap* |\n| ------- | ---------------- | ----------- | ------------------ |\n| ezETH | 35000 | 40000 | 50000 |\n| rsETH | 3000 | 10000 | 20000 |\n| weETH | 20000 | 20000** | 30000 |\n\n**DAI Pool**\n| Asset | Current limit | New limit | New limit cap* |\n| ------- | ---------------- | ----------- | ------------------ |\n| sUSDe | 0 | 2'000'000 | 2'000'000 |\n\n**USDT Pool**\n| Asset | Current limit | New limit | New limit cap* |\n| ------- | ---------------- | ----------- | ------------------ |\n| sUSDe | 0 | 2'000'000 | 2'000'000 |\n\n**GHO Pool**\n| Asset | Current limit | New limit | New limit cap* |\n| ------- | ---------------- | ----------- | ------------------ |\n| sUSDe | 0 | 1'000'000 | 1'000'000 |\n\n\\* *The technical multisig will be able to increase the limit up to the defined cap without additional voting, if following conditions are met: 1) >90% of current limit is filled 2) the on-chain liquidity for the asset is at least 1/3 of the new limit. On-chain liquidity is defined as the amount of asset that can be swapped into underlying with <2% slippage in pools supported by Gearbox.*\n\n** *The Balancer weETH/rETH pool that is primarily used by Gearbox to open/close weETH positions is currently somewhat imbalanced and only 80% of the current limit is used. Hence the limit cannot and does not need to be raised right now, but it is useful to give the technical multisig an ability to raise it in the future, if needed.*\n\n### Oracles\nThe main price feeds for weETH, ezETH and rsETH will be changed to Composite feeds based on Chainlink. The following price feeds will be used for Asset/ETH prices:\n\nezETH/ETH: https://data.chain.link/feeds/ethereum/mainnet/ezeth-eth\nweETH/ETH: https://data.chain.link/feeds/ethereum/mainnet/weeth-eth\nrsETH/ETH: https://data.chain.link/feeds/ethereum/mainnet/rseth-eth\n\nThese oracles will then be multiplied by ETH/USD (https://data.chain.link/feeds/ethereum/mainnet/eth-usd) to compute the final asset price against USD.\n\nThe currently used composite feeds based on Redstone ezETH/ETH, weETH/ETH and rsETH/ETH price feeds will be set as reserve price feeds.\n\n## Security and liquidity\n\nezETH has 10.5k liquidity in the Balancer ezETH/WETH pools and ~3k liquidity in the triLRT pool at the time of writing.\nrsETH has 3.5k liquidity in the Balancer rsETH/WETH pool at the time of writing.\nHence liquidity for these assets satisfies the risk committee requirement of `limit <= 3 * on-chain liquidity`.\n\n## Next steps and timelock\n\nIf the proposal is accepted, shortly after voting end transactions to update price feeds will be submitted to technical multisig. They will become executable in ~36 hours under the main timelock rules (may be a few hours more, as the transaction ETA is usually set with a buffer for signing time).\n\nLimit increases will be performed through ControllerTimelock, which has a 12 hour delay after the multisig signs the transaction. As such, limits should be increased within 24 hours after the vote ends.",

      "content": "# Motivation\n\nSince I've been in DAO since mid-2022, I've witnessed the evolution of Gearbox DAO products related to operational maintenance of the protocol. Despite the fact that the protocol itself is completely on-chain and completely autonomous, it is necessary to develop a number of internal products responsible for monitoring, data collection, and delivery of changes. These products are hidden from the eyes of ordinary users, but they play a significant role - they increase the security of the protocol, simplify the process of testing new versions and updates, and control the process of deploying changes (and decrease time to market!). I will give just a few examples of such internal products:\n\n## https://anvil.gearbox.foundation/ \nService that enables rapid development and testing of new features. It automates creation of new forks, deployment of new contracts, generation of reports and visualization of new features and running integration tests on new chain state.\n\n## https://risk.gearbox.foundation/ \nService for monitoring of both on-chain and off-chain events related to gearbox protocol.\n\n## sdk-gov\nSDK provides abstractions to assist developers with interacting with the Gearbox smart contracts in a Typescript/Javascript environment (e.g. websites, node scripts, liquidators etc). \n\n\nWith the growth of protocol metrics, the scope of such products is only expanding, so I propose the creation of a separate initiative for such tasks. This initiative will be focused on building products aimed at monitoring, collecting and processing data. Data processing will include analysis and monitoring of unusual behavior, analysis of risk metrics, etc. Using such a data-driven approach will increase the reliability of the protocol as a whole.\n\n# Initiative configuration\n\nThe team consists of three full-time initiative contributors:\n\n\n| Position                                         | Cost per Unit, $   | Unit  |\n|-------------------------------|------------------|-------|\n| Initiative Lead                             | 8,000                      | 1          |\n| Senior Fullstack developer     | 8,000.                     | 1          |\n| Analyst/Researcher                  | 4,000.                    | 0.5-1  |\n\n\n# Budget\n20k$/monthly* compensation and the corresponding amount in $GEAR depending on their multiplier choice, determined using a system of multipliers from GIP-43. At the same time, the Initiative Lead  is capable of determining when OBRA begins to be applied to other subDAO members (perhaps some will just work as outstaff, for others a test period will be required etc). \nAdditional 10k$/yearly budget for HR expenses. Out of this, the finder fee to an external unrelated platform will have to be paid for securing new members for this initiative. This is typically referred to as the finder’s fee in HR.\nIt is assumed that this initiative is automatically extended if there is no separate vote on its adjustment. This initiative, like a few others, rolls into the new cycles unless discontinued.\n\n# Legal Agreement\nContributors within this initiative, as well as other initiatives, can, if necessary, sign legal agreement with Gearbox Foundation. The entity name/signators and other parameters contributors/Initiative leads can specify directly with Gearbox Foundation. That specifically includes the recently requested smart contract initiative by DLTXperts change of name while keeping the initiative as is: DLTXperts Ltd to DLTXperts Limited as a grantee.\n\n# Voting\nSimple Approve/Reject",

Therefore, we propose several actions to finalize this:\n\n1) Add ezETH with LT = 90 to WETH Tier 1 Credit Manager\n2) Replace the current ezETH Main price feed from composite feed based on Redstone to one based on Chainlink. The Redstone composite price feed will be moved to reserve, which will enable partial withdrawals for this asset;\n\nAdditionally, Balancer ezETH/wstETH and Camelot V3 ezETH/WETH pools will be added to the CM, which was authorized by GIP-97.\n\n# Transaction list\n\nHuman-readable transaction log can be found [here](https://gearboxprotocol.notion.site/GIP-115-Specification-b507d5c0f400451083f8aade5c42a3f1).

      "title": "[GIP-112] Deploy V3 on Optimism",
      "content": "This proposal aims to request Gearbox DAO approval to deploy Gearbox V3 on Optimism. \n\n# Overview\nGearbox has long been asked to deploy on Optimism, but that required a lot of additional upgrades on the contract level to ensure security and solvency of the protocol, especially in conditions of (relatively) lower TVL and fractured liquidity in comparison with Ethereum Mainnet.\n\nFinally, with V3 (https://blog.gearbox.fi/gearbox-protocol-v3-the-onchain-credit-layer/) we’ve implemented per-asset quota limits and many other features that allow us to safely deploy on L2s, and have gone through rigorous audits. For V3, that was Chain Security and ABDK, alongside previous audits. See the article linked above for details.\n\nThe recently approval starting grant from Optimism is yet another strong incentive for why finally go to Optimism and get optimistic about the future of Superchain. See https://gov.optimism.io/t/cycle-19-final-grants-roundup/7850. \n\n# Use cases\nThis deployment is just the initial setup in our OP stack journey. This version will allow users to trade with leverage, as well as take advantage of leveraging Yearn vaults and leveraging LSDs. It should also be noted that this version already supports some Optimism-native protocols like Velodrome, and integration into native protocols should definitely be increased in the future.\n\n# Specification\n\n## Pools\n\nIt is proposed to start with two pools - WETH pool and USDC.e pool. These are the most active pools in our mainnet version and it seems that they will also be in demand in Optimism. In the future, we can plan to deploy other pools, but this should be discussed in separate proposals. \n\n## Tiers\n\nSimilar to mainnet deployment it is proposed to divide allowed tokens into two groups depending on volatility and on-chain liquidity: Tier-1 and Tier-2. This separation will allow us to deploy separate Credit Managers and implement separate limits for Credit Accounts depending on Assets-tier: Tier-1 has approx. 1k-200k$, Tier 2: 1k-50k$ (see actual numbers in config file below). These limits are important when liquidating accounts: a one-time liquidation of a big position of low-liquidity asset can lead to high price impact and bad debt. \nTier 1 Assets: WETH, WBTC,OP, USDC, USDC.e, DAI, USDT, wstETH, rETH, yvWETH, yvUSDC, yvUSDT, yvDAI\nTier 2 Assets: WLD, SNX\n\nDeploy Specification\nThe full state snapshot with all system parameters can be found [here](https://gearboxprotocol.notion.site/GIP-112-f117d56ec3d7435796228fb458999233?pvs=4) (specification file’s md5 checksum is c38c9399d142994b0df5f082ca1ee1d7). \n\nNote 1! In addition to these transactions, there will be txs to set Interest rate parameters for WETH and USDC.e pools to the same as current numbers on Mainnet. Check [here](https://docs.gearbox.finance/lending-market/pools-and-apy#where-does-the-yield-come-from). \nNote 2! OP Redstone oracle will be added as reserve price feed for OP token. \n\n## Deployment timeline\n1. Transactions will be queued for signing by Technical Multisig not later  5.04.2024, ETA will be set to 15-00 GMT 06.04.2024. These transactions will deploy protocol and put it on pause until snapshot voting is over. \n2. If the voting is successful:\n   a. Tech Multisig will unpause protocol and set timelock delay to 24 hours on 07.08 \n   b. Everyone will be able to vote for Quota Rates before 12-00 GMT 08.08 and/or provide liquidity to Pools\n   c. Leverage side goes live on Optimism after 12-00 GMT 08.08\n3. If the voting is unsuccessful: \n   a. Protocol stays on pause forever\n\n# Voting\nSimple Approve/Reject voting",

These funds are both liquidity for V3 pools and reserve funds. There are also 208,329 DAI left on the DAO wallet from V2, which I propose to transfer to the Reserve Fund and move from V2 pools to V3 pools, thus providing liquidity. It is important to say that for V3 dTokens we have provided a version that does not earn GEAR LM and thus does not take away part of GEAR from other users. \n\nYou can see that DAO wallet earned 3,016,881 GEAR while collecting commissions. ([See here](https://debank.com/profile/0x7b065fcb0760df0cea8cfd144e08554f3cea73d1)) I also suggest to \"claim\" the earned GEAR and leave them in the DAO wallet. The V2 version no longer has GEAR LM, so no more GEAR rewards will be credited to this wallet.\n\n##### Thus in this offer it is proposed:\nMove 208,329 DAI from V2 to V3 pool and them to the reserve fund wallet\nTransfer 3,016,881 GEAR from the DAO wallet and keep them\n\n##### Voting\napprove / reject",

      "title": "[GIP-107] Inflation Reduction + LM Reallocation",
      "content": "**Note:** no new supply is being proposed to release, just reallocating. And, reducing inflation! The organic rates are doing their job well, making GEAR LM obsolete, so why overspend…\n\n#### First Part: ETH pool\n\nFirst part is to remove a half of (W)ETH GEAR liquidity mining rewards. At current utilization, rates are 25% organic + ~1% in GEAR. There are also ezPoints of Renzo on the passive side. It feels unnecessary to have extra GEAR: the extra rate is too small to matter, but removing any inflation possible is always good when it doesn’t serve a strong purpose. \n\nKeep (W)ETH LM as 30M GEAR per year. That is $500K in GEAR per year at current price, resulting in +0.5% GEAR at 100M TVL of ETH pool, or +5% of GEAR at 10M TVL. Good for alignment with uses who want to have some GEAR exposure, no need to fully cut it now.\n\nThat means out of 63M GEAR a year, 33M can be reallocated for other purposes.\n\n#### Second Part: Stable Pools\n\nIn light of new passive pools launching for USDT, DAI, and GHO [GIP-103], some incentives for bootstrapping would make sense. However, there will NOT be new supply! Instead, it is being proposed to use some of the USDC pool GEAR rewards and ETH pool rewards. For USDC, organic rates are sufficient at this point anyway: 27% organic rates + 3% GEAR. The ~3% doesn’t move the needle for passive capital providers, so a half of it can be reused.\n\nAs [GIP-85] specified, currently 52M GEAR per year is given to the USDC pool, or $840K at current market price. A half can be taken and given to those new pools, or ~$420K. That still leaves the USDC pool with +1.5% of GEAR on top of organic USDC APY at current TVL.\n\n#### Reallocation to new pools\n\nSo 33M from (W)ETH pool and 26M from USDC pool can then unite into 59M of GEAR of rewards which can be reallocated. Now let’s see how much is needed for what.\n\nThe expected TVL for DAI and USDT to start with could be $5M, while for GHO $2M. That means, to satisfy 5% additional APY on each pool, it would require $250K of GEAR for DAI and USDT, and ~$100K of GEAR for the GHO pool per annum. The organic rates kicking in from Ethena USDe utilization will be able to drive organic rates much higher into the 25%+ territory, see the current state of USDC pool: https://app.gearbox.fi/pools/. \n\nTo put the numbers more clear:\nUSDT: 5.71 GEAR/block (~15M GEAR/year)\nDAI: 5.71 GEAR/block (~15M GEAR/year)\nGHO: 2.47 GEAR/block (~6.5M GEAR/year)\nUSDC: 9.89 GEAR/block (~26M GEAR/year)\nETH: 11.41 GEAR/block (~30M GEAR per annum)\n \n\n#### Rewards Buffer\n\nIn total, ~22.5M of GEAR per year saved, ~$350K emissions reduction. To avoid further possible new allocation into the new passive pools, this amount is proposed to be set aside for any new pool if the DAO votes one in. It would be enough for 5% APY at $7M TVL. \n\nLet’s recap what the changes could look like:\nUSDC LM remains, just slightly reduced: 27% organic + 1.5% GEAR.\nETH LM remains, just slightly reduced: 25% organic + 0.5% GEAR.\nGHO pool: 5% GEAR APY + (25% organic) at $2M TVL\nUSDT pool: 5% GEAR APY + (25% organic) at $5M TVL\nDAI pool: 5% GEAR APY + (25% organic) at $5M TVL\n\n**When active:** if GIP-103 is voted in, within a day ideally March 25/26.",

      "title": "GIP 106 - Intent to shift GEAR liquidity incentives to Gear/wETH Balancer Core Pool",
      "content": "**Purpose**\nThis proposal authorizes the effort of seeking core pool status for a GEAR/wETH pool on Balancer. Should Core Pool status be granted, this proposal pre-approves the shift of GEAR liquidity incentives from Curve to Balancer. \n\n**Execution**\nThe following steps would be executed:\n1. Ov3rkoalafied to deploy 50/50 GEAR/wETH pool on balancer, 1% fee tier.\n2. Ov3rkoalafied to submit a proposal to balancer seeking core pool status for the GEAR/wETH pool\n3. Should core pool status be granted, Gearbox multisig will shift GEAR incentives from the curve pool to the new balancer pool. Direct incentives would still be utilized (not vlAura bribes), unless changed in a future proposal. \n4. After the core pool has been live for a period of time, I recommend re-evaluating the GEAR incentives for a potential reduction.\n\n**Reasoning:**\nIn a typical Balancer pool, 50% of the generated fees go to LPers, 12.5% goes to the Balancer DAO, and 37.5% to veBAL lockers. In a Balancer Core Pool, 50% of fees go to LPers, 12.5% goes to the Balancer DAO, and 37.5% is used to bribe veBAL/vlAura voters to vote for the Core Pool. This means that a portion of fees generated by the GEAR/wETH pool would go directly to incentivizing liquidity, rather than generally to veBAL lockers. \n\nThe expectation is that a Core Pool can sustain more liquidity with the same incentives than a standard liquidity pool. \n\nThe fees from the 1% fee tier are expected to outpace the anticipated reduction in volume. This is typically the case with 1% fee pools (ALCX/ETH being a good example). Additionally, fees on trade most greatly affect traders, not investors. In effect, the fee costs traders a bit more with the benefit of making GEAR/wETH liquidity provision more sustainable.\n\nTo add some estimates: Gear/weth ranges between about 50k and 200k/day of average volume, per https://curvemonitor.com/#/platform/pools.  At $50k/day, that would amount to $50k x 365 x 1% x 37.5% = $70k annual bribes for the pool. At 200k/day, that goes up to $280k. At the current pool size of $3.6m, assuming an Aura bribe multiplier of 1.25, that amounts to an APR of between 2.5% and 10%. **With more significant volumes, the pool could potentially be self-sustaining. **  Note that the projected APR could be expected to be lower if volume is reduced due to the higher fee, however a few high volume days can easily make up for that. The peak volume day is $840k so far, which alone would generate $3k of incentives. \n\n**Voting**\nFor, against, abstain.",

This can be raised in the future to 3M for each pool without additional voting by the main multisig or through ControllerTimelockV3;\n2) The quota limits for USDe in DAI and USDT pools are increased to 5M. The limit for the GHO pool will remain at 3M, as in the original proposal. All USDe limits in these pools can be raised to 10M without additional voting by the main multisig or through ControllerTimelockV3;\n3) Max quota rate for USDe and sUSDe in the new pools will be set to 50%, to bring it in line with the updated rates from GIP-102;\n\n## Configurations files\nDAI Pool:\nhttps://github.com/Gearbox-protocol/sdk-gov/blob/bd6728bf667ca451b92550b2cb497cb0a8027c20/src/config/configs/daiConfigMainnet.ts\n\nUSDT Pool:\nhttps://github.com/Gearbox-protocol/sdk-gov/blob/bd6728bf667ca451b92550b2cb497cb0a8027c20/src/config/configs/usdtConfigMainnet.ts\n\nGHO Pool:\nhttps://github.com/Gearbox-protocol/sdk-gov/blob/bd6728bf667ca451b92550b2cb497cb0a8027c20/src/config/configs/ghoConfigMainnet.ts\n\n## Voting\nSimple approve/reject.",

Those USDT lovers are looking for USDT farms, USDC lovers are looking for USDC farms, DAI lovers are looking for DAI farms, etc. Therefore, it is proposed to create several additional avenues for the provision of stablecoins: USDT pool, DAI pool and GHO pool.\n\n## Specification \n\nIt is proposed to add initially only the most popular strategies on USDC pool: \n- USDe,\n- sUSDe,\n- sDAI.\n\nIn the future, it will be possible to gradually add other strategies to the pools. \n\nOther parameters are proposed to be set to the same as in the current USDC Pool. This list of parameters includes: \n- Interest Rate Curve (check last numbers [here](https://docs.gearbox.finance/lending-market/pools-and-apy#id-1.-two-tick-utilization-curve) )\n- Quota Rates and Fees\n- Liquidation Thresholds\n- Credit Manager parameters.\n\nOverall limit for Credit Manager is proposed to set at 10M GHO/USDT/DAI respectively.\n\nFull configurations files can be found [here](https://gearboxprotocol.notion.site/GIP-103-Specifications-e70ebd62d4d1403d927dfd3da2fd05e0) (md5 checksum 23d7092be76388b16e19756e3a9f8f4d) . This is transactions details, that will be executed if the proposal is passed.\n\n\n## Adjusting limits for USDC\nTier 1 USDC Credit Manager is close reaching the maximum allowed limits (see GIP-97). Therefore, it is proposed to increase it: If current caps are full, limits for USDe can be increased by Timelock Controller and Technical Multisig up to 40M USDC as well as overall debt limit of Tier 1 Credit Manager - up to 65M USDC, without any further voting. Technical Multisig can do it gradually or one-time at its own discretion.\n\n## Voting\n\nSimple Approve/Reject voting",

      "title": "[GIP-102] Quota Rates - Bull Mode Activation",
      "content": "The bull market led to an increase in longs and changes in rates for various leverage strategies. The change in rates is noticeable for both DEXes and CEXes. This proposal aims to adjust the current quota rate ranges to take into account changing market conditions.\n\nThis doesn’t necessarily lead to any increases, the goal is just to set up the range in a more broad way. Then it’s up to GEAR stakers and gauges to decide. It’s just about optionality.\n\n_Important note: this proposal is in the “optimistic format” previously used for GIP-95. The technical multisig will queue transactions in the Timelock if the proposal gets Quorum approval. Later if the proposal ends with approval, Technical multisig executes changes after timelock delay ends. Otherwise veto multisig will cancel txs execution._\n\n## Justification\n\nNow funding rates on CEXes and DEXes are 30%+ for ETH, BTC and 100%+ for longer tail assets (see data aggregated by [Coinglass](https://www.coinglass.com/FundingRate) below). While on Gearbox quota limits are limited to 12% for ETH, BTC and 24/40% for other assets. It is proposed to decrease the existing gap, however, not necessarily fully close it. Just adjust it to the market needs. With that, there is also a higher chance to grow the passive side of the market (lenders) to grow TVL further.\n\n \n![Screenshot 2024-03-14 at 10.16.28.png](ipfs://bafkreihomk6ozibvblfn44jqyflh6w6pdgnrywrawch64qrsezcdptyegi)\n    \n\nChanges logic are following:\n\n- There is big demand for long-ing tokens using stables on the market. Taking into account that Gearbox USDC pool already has a 20%+ yield, from the profit maximization point of view it makes sense to increase the rates from 12%. It is proposed to set targets for WBTC and WETH to 40%, while for longer tail assets to 50%. It is worth considering that on perpetuals there are peaks up to 100% and even higher, but one of our advantages is the predictability of rates, so we just can’t chase for high peak values… Proposed increase of rates allows the passive lender side to earn good yields so it seems this value is justified.\n- Maker’s DSR’s rate increased to 15%. It shifts the farming landscape target to 15%+. Therefore it is proposed to use its maxRate value for USD-nominated farms. As well it is proposed to change maxRate for USD-nominated Boosted trades options.\n- It is proposed to keep current values of Quota max rate for trading assets for WBTC and WETH pool.\n- It is proposed to change maxRate for USDe and sUSDe to 50% as current rates on market for these assets are 60%+.\n\n## Specification\n\nlist of changes according to the logic described above:\n\n| **Pool** | **Token** | **minRate** | **maxRate** | **new minRate** | **new maxRate** |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Trade USDC v3 | WBTC | 0.04% | 12% | 0.04% | 40% |\n| Trade USDC v3 | WETH | 0.04% | 12% | 0.04% | 40% |\n| Trade USDC v3 | STETH | 0.04% | 12% | 0.04% | 40% |\n| Trade USDC v3 | MKR | 0.80% | 24% | 0.80% | 50% |\n| Trade USDC v3 | UNI | 0.80% | 24% | 0.80% | 50% |\n| Trade USDC v3 | LINK | 0.80% | 24% | 0.80% | 50% |\n| Trade USDC v3 | LDO | 0.80% | 24% | 0.80% | 50% |\n| Trade USDC v3 | CRV | 2.40% | 40% | 2.40% | 50% |\n| Trade USDC v3 | CVX | 2.40% | 40% | 2.40% | 50% |\n| Trade USDC v3 | yvWETH | 0.04% | 12% | 0.04% | 40% |\n| Trade USDC v3 | yvWBTC | 0.04% | 12% | 0.04% | 40% |\n| Trade USDC v3 | sDAI | 0.50% | 5%  | 0.50% | 15% |\n| Trade USDC v3 | yvUSDC | 0.50% | 5%  | 0.50% | 15% |\n| Trade USDC v3 | yvDAI | 0.50% | 5%  | 0.50% | 15% |\n| Trade USDC v3 | stkcvxcrvUSDUSDC | 1.00% | 5%  | 1.00% | 15% |\n| Trade USDC v3 | stkcvxcrvUSDUSDT | 1.00% | 7%  | 1.00% | 15% |\n| Trade USDC v3 | stkcvxcrvUSDFRAX | 1.00% | 8%  | 1.00% | 15% |\n| Trade USDC v3 | stkcvxcrvFRAX | 1.00% | 4%  | 1.00% | 15% |\n| Trade USDC v3 | USDe | 0.50% | 30% | 0.50% | 50% |\n| Trade USDC v3 | sUSDe | 0.50% | 30% | 0.50% | 50% |\n| Trade USDC v3 | ezETH | 0.50% | 30% | 0.50% | 40% |\n| Trade WBTC v3 | yvUSDC | 0.04% | 12% | 0.04% | 27% |\n| Trade WBTC v3 | sDAI | 0.04% | 12% | 0.04% | 27% |\n| Trade WETH v3 | yvUSDC | 0.04% | 12% | 0.04% | 27% |\n| Trade WETH v3 | sDAI | 0.01% | 15% | 0.04% | 27% |\n\nAlso, as a continuation of GIP-99, it is proposed to set a limit for some farms to 0:\n\n**USDC pool**:\n\n- yvDAI\n- yvUSDC\n- stkcvxcrvFRAX\n\n**WETH pool**:\n\n-  stkcvxcrvUSDETHCRV\n- stkcvxcrvUSDTWBTCWETH\n\nThe reasoning of this is that now the main use cases are in a limited set of strategies and in this regard, the remaining strategies with 0 usage do not bring any additional yield to the LPs, Credit Account users also are not interested in it, while any additional strategy continues to complicate system and increase its risks. Therefore, there is no need to keep assets with zero utilization, it is better to set a Quota Limit to 0 and return it when market conditions change.\n\nThe transactions log with all changes can be found [here](https://gearboxprotocol.notion.site/GIP-101-transactions-log-d4a487fd7ab645b18a0bb0ba85623987?pvs=4) (log file’s md5 checksum is 023552e2aff1dfabda01737cc1a4815e).\n\n# Voting\n\nSimple approve/reject voting",

The Octav team will spend a few hours each month with the Gearbox team to gather feedback to further improve the platform by offering more transparency features for the community. \n\n\n**Distribution:** The treasury reports can be generated with 1 click by a member of the gearbox team for any time period.\n\n### Term\nThe term for these services will be 1 year. After this period, Octav will approach the DAO for renewal.\n\n### Motivation\nThis initiative focuses on surfacing the on-chain metrics and key developments of the Gearbox Treasury to facilitate protocol transparency. By providing regular, data-centric reports and access to view any transaction performed by the Gearbox treasury at any time, your community can be on top of every dollar flowing in and out. This transparency highlights a commitment to informing and guiding DAO members through the intricacies of Gearbox’s operations and strategic decisions.",

      "title": "[GIP-99] Adjusting Limits on Mainnet",
      "content": "This proposal suggests changing the limits for the current setup on Mainnet.\n\n## Usage of quotas\n\nAbout 2.5 months have already passed since the launch of v3 on the Mainnet, so I would like to analyze which assets are in demand and which are not. As you remember, gearbox v3 has quota functionality for each asset, which allows to manage how much money from the pool will be allocated to the asset. This allows to properly manage risk in the protocol.\n\nCurrent allocation of funds in Credit Accounts are shown in image below (you can check yourself in [Dune](https://dune.com/queries/3499396/5884967)). The main use case now is LSD and LRT (which is obvious due to the hype of recent weeks): ~50M in weETH, ~40M in ezETH, ~3.5M in stETH. We also see that WBTC, USDC, WETH are used (for PURE).\n\n![pic_1802.png](ipfs://bafkreidrrup56bl72eyfvltxybmpz7fcxnpuisizuu3vd3zu2hjopw2j2y)\n \nHowever, it is interesting to analyze other assets - whether they are in demand at all. It can be seen that LINK, UNI, LDO, CVX are also used as trading assets, but their volume is limited to 0.5M in total (you can check current Quota limits [here](https://snapshot.org/#/gearbox.eth/proposal/0x529dee318dcdb95b9b9d5172c4cc78fef849434b8bfe42cae534fa9ea842fd82))\n\n![pic_1803.png](ipfs://bafkreidp44n7pelhd64suxkcajv7apkvlbzbzrtujehzzkchgdpwyhg7ca)\n    \n\nTherefore it is proposed to reduce the max quota Limit for Tier 2,3 assets  following this table:\n\n|     | **for USDC POOL** | **for WBTC pool** | **For WETH pool** |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| MKR | 500,000 USDC | 7.5 WBTC | 135 WETH |\n| UNI | 500,000 USDC | 7.5 WBTC | 135 WETH |\n| LINK | 500,000 USDC | 7.5 WBTC | 135 WETH |\n| LDO | 500,000 USDC | 7.5 WBTC | 135 WETH |\n| CRV | 200,000 USDC | 3 WBTC | 55 WETH |\n| CVX | 200,000 USDC | 3 WBTC | 55 WETH |\n\nAlso, due to the lack of demand, it is proposed to set a Quota Limits for APE and FXS to 0 for USDC,WBTC,WETH pools.\n\n## Boosting LRTs \n    \n\nNow weETH and ezETH limits are used on 75%+ in WETH Credit Manager. Therefore a further increase in the limit on weETH and ezETH is proposed. But due to the large allocation of funds to LRT, it is proposed to take into account the depth of liquidity for each of the LRTs. Of course, a withdrawal despite a delay of 7 days will be a good arbitrage opportunity, however, due to the delay there may be short-term price fluctuations, so deeper liquidity is a plus. Below you can see selling pressure that leads to 1% price impact on Mainnet:\n\n| Price impact | weETH | ezETH |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1%  | 6,965 eth | 11,660 eth |\n\n\\* 1inch is used to define price impact\n\n1. It is proposed to set quota limits not exceeding x3 of the available liquidity on DEXs. Accordingly, the maximum quota limit for weETH will be 21,000 eth, for ezETH 35,000 eth. \n2. It is proposed to increase the Quota Limit for each asset gradually, increment step is 5,000 eth. Quota Limit within values at p.1 can be increased by Technical Multisig as soon as Quota Usage reaches 80%+.\n\n## Voting\nSimple Approve/Reject voting",

      "content": "## Overview\n\nCurrent utilization of the USDC pool is ~50%, which is good, but still lower than our target of 80-90%. To increase utilization, it is proposed to add USDe and sUSDe tokens, as well as ezETH to enable boosting WETH leverage trades with points.\n\nIt is also proposed to add ezETH to the WETH arbitrum pool with a 0 quota limit, in order to be able to quickly enable the token once ezETH liquidity arrives.\n\n## Onboarding Ethena for Trade USDC pool and increasing quota limits for weETH\n\nEthena quickly burst into the stablecoin market: despite its launch less than a month ago, it is already in the [Top 6](https://defillama.com/stablecoins). This rapid growth is supported by the shards distribution program. Therefore it is proposed to add USDe and sUSDe.\n\n| Asset | Quota increase fee | Min quota rate | Max quota rate | Limit |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| USDe | 0%  | 0.05% | 30% | 3M USDC\\* |\n| sUSDe | 0%  | 0.05% | 30% | 3M USDC\\* |\n\n## Enabling ezETH as boosted trade option\n\nWe saw huge interest in the leveraging Eigenlayer points on WETH Credit Accounts. And it seems in a bull market it’s good to have an option for users to Long ETH and farm points at the same time. This is a unique feature of Composable Leverage!\n\n| Asset | Quota increase fee | Min quota rate | Max quota rate | Limit |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ezETH | 0%  | 0.05% | 30% | 3M USDC\\* |\n\n## Credit Manager specification\n\nBelow are specification and changes that should be made to [USDC Tier 1 Credit Manager](https://etherscan.io/address/0x3eb95430fdb99439a86d3c6d7d01c3c561393556):\n\n### Collateral tokens & LTVs\n\n| Token | LTV | Comment |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| ezETH | 90% |     |\n| USDe | 90% |     |\n| sUSDe | 90% |     |\n\n### Adapters\n\nThe following is the list of new adapters and pools to be connected to USDC Tier 1 CM:\n\n- UNISWAP_V3_ROUTER\n  - USD_e/USDT 0.01% pool\n- BALANCER_VAULT\n  - Balancer ezETH/WETH pool\n- CURVE USDe_USDC_POOL\n- CURVE USDe_DAI_POOL\n- CURVE sUSDe_sDAI_POOL\n\n## Enabling ezETH on Arbitrum\n\nIn response to popular demand, we also want to allow leveraged restaking with Renzo’s ezETH on Arbitrum.\n\nHowever, currently ezETH/WETH liquidity on Arbitrum is very shallow. We expect Renzo to increase liquidity soon, and in order to enable ezETH leveraging as quickly as possible once that happens, it is proposed to add ezETH to the WETH pool as a quoted token, while the limit is set to 0.\n\n| Asset | Quota increase fee | Min quota rate | Max quota rate | Limit |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ezETH | 0%  | 0.05% | 30% | 0   |\n\nWe also propose to allow the technical multisig on Arbitrum to conditionally enable ezETH leveraging when two things happen:\n\n- There is significant liquidity for the ezETH / WETH pair on Uniswap V3 or Balancer (at least 500 WETH worth of liquidity);\n- Connext enables quick withdrawals of ezETH from Arbitrum;\n\nOnce those things happen, the technical multisig would be able, without additional voting, to:\n\n- Increase the ezETH quota limit to up to 1000 WETH (but can be less, depending on available liquidity);\n- Allow the pool required for trading in the WETH Tier 1 Credit Manager (both Uniswap V3 and Balancer adapters are already connected, so only the required pool needs to be allowed);\n\nWith this scheme, we would be able to activate ezETH leveraging within 36 hours after liquidity goes live.\n\n## Notes\n\n\\* If cap is full, limits per asset can be increased by Timelock Controller and Technical Multisig up to 15M USDC as well as overall debt limit of Credit Manager - up to 30M, without any further voting.\n\n# Voting\n\nSimple Approve/Reject voting",

      "title": "[GIP-96] LRT Composite oracles and other updates",
      "content": "## Overview\nThis proposal is to implement several minor improvements to the current mainnet deployment, in order to improve user experience and risk management. \n\nThe proposed updates are:\n- Changing weETH, ezETH, osETH price feeds to asset/ETH x ETH/USD composite feeds, which will prevent unnecessary liquidation due to asynchronous price feed updates;\n- Setting reserve price feeds for weETH, ezETH and osETH to enable partial withdrawals and improve security;\n- Setting a new ControllerTimelockV3 policy that would allow the technical multisig to re-enable paused borrowing without delay;\n- Increasing USDC Tier 1 Credit Manager borrowing limits;\n\n*Important note: this proposal is in the “optimistic format” previously used for GIP-95. I.e. the technical multisig will queue transactions in the Timelock simultaneously with the voting start, with the delay ETA set to at least 4 hours after scheduled voting end. Should the proposal be voted down, the veto multisig will cancel the transactions.*\n\n## Composite Oracles\nCurrently weETH, ezETH and osETH use Redstone oracles weETH/USD, ezETH/USD, osETH/USD accordingly. However, this creates potential risks for holders of leveraged positions due to the different update times of the X/USD and ETH/USD oracles. Accordingly, during periods of high price volatility, this can lead to the difference between the values of X/USD and ETH/USD exceeding 1-2%, which can lead to liquidations. At the same time, the price of X/ETH will remain stable. To solve this problem it is proposed to use a composite oracle similar to the stETH/ETH oracle (see GIP-28). \nAccordingly, the price oracle for X will take the weEXTH/ETH price from Redstone, determined based on the X price on DEXs.\nNote. Prices of weETH/ETH, ezETH/ETH, osETH/ETH are determined based on the on-chain liquidity in the pool, and not based on the amount of ETH staked. This means that in case of high sell pressure on DEXes, the price may deviate from the peg because of 7-day withdrawal period. Users should take this into account when using high leverage.\n\nRedstone Composite Oracle should be applied to next assets: \nweETH\nezETH\nosETH\n*Note. Other eth-correlated assets currently available on Gearbox already uses Chainlink Composite oracles.*\n\n## LRT Reserve Feeds\nTo provide additional security against oracle providers being compromised, Gearbox uses a system with a main and reserve price feed. The main price feed is used for most operations, however, when a user attempts a partial withdrawal, a minimum between the main and reserve price feed is used. This ensures that if the main price feed is compromised and its price is inflated, an attacker cannot drain funds using a malicious withdrawal. Additionally, in case of an emergency the reserve price feed can be quickly switched to using a ControllerTimelock policy. \n\nWe propose to add the normal ETH/USD Chainlink feed as the reserve feed for weETH, ezETH and osETH. This means that for partial withdrawals these assets will be priced as min(Redstone price, 1 ETH) and in cases of emergency (if the DAO decides to switch to a reserve feed) they will be priced as 1 ETH.\n\n\n## setMaxDebtMultiplier policy\nAnalogous to the policy set in the Arbitrum deployment, we propose to change the following policy:\n\n### ICreditConfiguratorV3.setMaxDebtPerBlockMultiplier(multiplier)\nSets the max debt per block, as a multiple of max Credit Account debt.\n\nadmin - RISK_ROLE\ndelay - 0 hours\nexactValue - Not restricted\nminValue - Not restricted\nmaxValue - 4\nupdatePeriod - Not restricted\nminPctChangeDown - Not restricted\nminPctChangeUp - Not restricted\nmaxPctChangeDown - Not restricted\nmaxPctChangeUp - Not restricted\nminChange - Not restricted\nmaxChange - Not restricted\n\nThis would allow the technical multisig to enable and disable borrowing without additional delays, which in turn gives the monitoring system more flexibility to pause borrowing if any suspicious activity is detected.\n\n## Increasing limits for USDC Credit Managers\nWe also propose to increase the limit for the USDC Tier 1 Credit Manager to 10 000 000 USDC (the limit is currently 5M USDC and is 90% filled). The technical multisig will also be able to raise limits on other USDC Credit Managers to up to 10M without additional voting, if their borrowing limits are reached.\n\n## Voting\n\nSimple Approve/Reject voting",

      "title": "GIP-95 Arbitrum PURE switch on request",
      "content": "This proposal aims to request Gearbox DAO to switch on the PURE margin trading deployment on Arbitrum in order to qualify for LTIP grant proposal.\n\n# Overview\n\nGearbox has long been asked to deploy on sidechains and L2 rollups, but that required a lot of additional upgrades on the contract level to ensure security and solvency of the protocol, especially in conditions of (relatively) lower TVL and fractured liquidity of L2s.\n\nFinally, with V3 (<https://blog.gearbox.fi/gearbox-protocol-v3-the-onchain-credit-layer/>) we’ve implemented per-asset quota limits and many other features that allow us to safely deploy on L2s, and have gone through rigorous [audits](https://docs.gearbox.finance/risk-and-security/audits-bug-bounty). For V3, that was Chain Security and ABDK, alongside previous audits. Hence, we are now ready to deploy on Arbitrum for the first expansion of Composable Leverage Credit Layer beyond mainnet.\n\nArbitrum is one of the most active chains from the DeFi usage perspective and has many possible composability plays and integrations available to Gearbox DAO to consider. This deployment is live and functional (but currently paused pending approval by the DAO), and allows to leverage some assets unique to Arbitrum (more in the deployment specification linked below). The goal of this is to qualify for the LTIP and harness some usage before the Arbitrum DAO makes the decision on the grant distribution, with a safe yet robust Gearbox PURE.\n\nGearbox DAO, if it votes to unpause the deployment, can enable PURE margin trading and other strategies beginning March 1 and gather some traction before March 3. Over the course of the next few months, if LTIP is successful, more work can be done in order to enable native integrations with Camelot, Arbitrum, MIM Abracadabra deployment, GMX, Jones DAO, Dopex, and others. The LTIP proposal is to follow a day after this snapshot succeeds.\n\n# Specification\n\n## Pools\n\nIt is proposed to start with two pools - WETH pool and USDC.e pool. These are the most active pools in our mainnet version and it seems that they will also be in demand in Arbitrum. In the future, we can plan to deploy other pools, but this should be discussed in separate proposals.\n\n## Tiers\n\nSimilar to mainnet deployment it is proposed to divide allowed tokens into two groups depending on volatility and on-chain liquidity: Tier-1 and Tier-2. This separation will allow us to deploy separate Credit Managers and implement separate limits for Credit Accounts depending on Assets-tier.

      "title": "[GIP-94] Leverage Restaking Boom",
      "content": "# Overview\n\nYesterday Gearbox launched leveraged restaking and has already filled the 2500 ETH cap. Due to the strong demand from the user side, it seems reasonable to further expand leveraged restaking offers further. This proposal aims to achieve that, by offering an increase in limits, adding new LRT assets, and removing the Degen NFT requirement for access.\n\n*Note: This proposal is urgent. After reaching the quorum with majority voting to approve, the technical multisig will queue the required transaction immediately (before the voting ends). Timelock ETA will be set up to 4 hours after the end of voting.* \n\n*Should the proposal be rejected after transactions are set up, the veto multisig will cancel all transactions they mature.*\n\n## Onboarding Renzo for Trade WETH pool and increasing quota limits for weETH\n\n1. Restaking narrative has exploded over the past couple of months, reaching over [3.5 billion TVL](https://defillama.com/protocols/Liquid%20Restaking). And although Gearbox has begun a leveraged restaking narrative with Ether Fi, there are other promising alternatives on the market. This proposal suggests to onboard Renzo protocol, to provide more strategy variety and also increase total available LRT on-chain liquidity.\n2. Due the high demand, this proposal suggests to increase the quota limit for weETH to 15,000 WETH\\*.\n\n| Asset | Quota increase fee | Min quota rate | Max quota rate | Limit |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ezETH | 0%  | 0.05% | 30% | 15,000 WETH |\n| weETH | 0%  | 0.05% | 30% | 15,000 WETH |\n\n# Add new WETH Restaking Credit Manager\n\nA new dedicated Credit Manager will be created specifically for LRT assets. This manager doesn’t require any access control (DegenNFT), because LRT assets are liquid ERC-20 tokens that are traded on dexes and have deep liquidity there. The new Credit Manager will also have a slightly lower liquidation premium, to allow for higher LTs and leverage.\n\n### Limits & fees\n\n1. Minimal debt principal - 25 WETH\n2. Maximal debt principal - 500 WETH\n3. Interest spread - 25%\n4. Liquidation premium - 3%\n5. DAO liquidation fee - 1%\n6. Expiration liquidation premium - 2%\\*\\*\n7. DAO expiration liquidation fee - 1%\\*\\*\n8. Credit Manager debt limit - 30000 WETH\\*\n9. DegenNFTs are not required to open accounts\n\n### Collateral tokens & LTVs\n\n| Token | LTV | Comment |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| ezETH | 91.5% |     |\n| weETH | 91.5% |     |\n| rETH | 0   | Used for routing, can’t be used as collateral |\n| rETH-f | 0   | Curve LP token, added for compatibility, can’t be used as collateral \n\n### Adapters\n\nThe following is the list of contracts for which adapters are connected to the CM:\n\n- UNISWAP_V3_ROUTER\n  - rETH/ETH 0.05% pool\n  - rETH/ETH 0.01% pool\n- BALANCER_VAULT\n  - Balancer rETH/weETH pool\n  - Balancer rETH/WETH pool\n  - Balancer ezETH/WETH pool\n  - Balancer ezETH/weETH/rswETH pool\n- CURVE_RETH_ETH_POOL\n\n## Controller Policies Change\n\n[GIP-91](https://snapshot.org/#/gearbox.eth/proposal/0xc86300de5025021fb18ff69cc8a8854174bf48ebd3667ab6e4acf18199240eb3) introduced Timelock Policies, allowing quota limit increases by 30% and credit manager debt limit increases by 70% per month without additional voting. However, due to high demand, the delay in changing the limits leads to degradation of UX. So it is proposed to allow the ControllerTimelock’s RISK_ROLE (the technical multisig) to change values freely within the caps stated above (i.e. to any value up to 15000 WETH for weETH/ezETH and 30000 WETH for credit manager borrowing limit) without additional governance voting.\n\nIn practice this means that the following policies will be set:\n\n### IPoolV3.setCreditManagerDebtLimit(cm, limit)\n\nSets the max debt per Credit Account.\n\n| admin | RISK_ROLE |\n| --- | --- |\n| delay | 12 hours |\n| exactValue | Not restricted |\n| minValue | Not restricted |\n| maxValue | Not restricted |\n| updatePeriod | Not restricted |\n| minPctChangeDown | Not restricted |\n| minPctChangeUp | Not restricted |\n| maxPctChangeDown | Not restricted |\n| maxPctChangeUp | Not restricted |\n| minChange | Not restricted |\n| maxChange | Not restricted |\n\n###\n\n### IPoolQuotaKeeperV3.setTokenLimit(token, limit)\n\nSets a new quota limit for a token.\n\n| admin | RISK_ROLE |\n| --- | --- |\n| delay | 12 hours |\n| exactValue | Not restricted |\n| minValue | Not restricted |\n| maxValue | Not restricted |\n| updatePeriod | Not restricted |\n| minPctChangeDown | Not restricted |\n| minPctChangeUp | Not restricted |\n| maxPctChangeDown | Not restricted |\n| maxPctChangeUp | Not restricted |\n| minChange | Not restricted |\n| maxChange | Not restricted |\n\nNote that RISK_ROLE is currently the main technical multisig, so this does not increase governance risk, but allows the multisig to update caps under a shorter delay.\n\n## Remove WBTC farm incentives\n\nWe see (check [here](https://charts.gearbox.fi/pools))  high utilization of USDC and WETH pools while the utilization of WBTC pool is less than 10%. In this regard, it is proposed to remove LM rewards from WBTC pool.\n\n## Notes\n\n\\* This is the maximal quota limit per asset / credit manager debt limit. The timelock controller can set the cap to any value at or below this maximum with a 12 hour delay.\n\n\\*\\* Note that this Credit Manager will not have an expirable Credit Facade connected initially, but these fees need to be set regardless.\n\n# Voting\n\nSimple Approve/Reject voting",

      "title": "[GIP-93] STIMMIES: Incentives for PURE trading competition",
      "content": "## Summary \n\nSTIMMIES is a trading competition/loyalty program designed for PURE margin trading. The goal of STIMMIES is to help increase product awareness and adoption through gamification and incentives and to bring more sophisticated traders to Gearbox. Traders will earn STIMMIES for their trading activity on PURE, which will be redeemable for $GEAR every 2 weeks. \n\n## Motivation\n\nLeverage trading, even onchain, is a highly competitive DeFi vertical with established players. This vertical though is largely dominated by a single leverage mechanism, perpetuals. Like every product, perpetuals too have some pros and cons though due to a lack of options, users are largely reliant on perps. Gearbox has innovated and deployed PURE to offer users leverage through Margin Trading. \n\nMargin Trading is created by enabling leverage trading of spot assets on top of DEXes like Uniswap, Curve, and others. This enables PURE to offer lower rates, deeper liquidity, farming with leveraged trades and more. These differentiations enable Gearbox to tap into a different segment of users. \n\nBut in order to solidify these differentiations, it is important to push the product and part of that requires incentivisation to mobilise traders. As well as to gain adoption through pushing referrals. This is why STIMMIES are required to push PURE. You can read the complete details about STIMMIES [here.](https://www.notion.so/gearboxprotocol/PURE-Trading-Competition-Alpha-Referrals-STIMMIES-are-here-3452a13485da4fc0961c9ffa7fc55785)\n\n## Proposal\n\nThis proposal is to the STIMMIES programme fund with 0.5% of $GEAR supply till the end of Q1. The funds will be transferred to the VIBES multisig and will be processed every 2 weeks as per traders’ activity. At the end of Q1, if some $GEAR remains, it’ll be rolled over to the next instalment of STIMMIES if the programme is continued. Otherwise, it will be returned to the DAO treasury.",

      "title": "[GIP-91]: ControllerTimelock policies and other configuration",
      "content": "## Overview\nThis proposal is to set the new ControllerTimelockV3 contract as `controller` for various contracts and set up policies for parameter changes. Additionally, a misconfiguration is fixed for V2 Credit Managers that still have open accounts.\n\n## ControllerTimelock logic\nCertain functions in GearboxV3 contracts are marked as `controllerOnly`, which means a special controller separate from the main system configurator can be set, and will be able to call these functions. This enables appointing limited-privilege admins to change system parameters without waiting for the main 2-day timelock (and having to mobilize the main multisig), which may be crucial to react to attacks, changing market conditions and other risk events.\n\nControllerTimelockV3 will be set as such “controller” in all contracts that support it. It will then allow DAO-appointed admins to change parameters within certain boundaries defined by a “policy”, and under a shorter timelock. \n\n## Controller parameters\nFor the full list of affected contracts, admins and policies, refer to the specification: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VrTTAxMnAB3YY-nYYRCsJ5N0O0QSvoZq7nf6mdLkXgw/edit?usp=sharing\n\n## Setting V2 Credit Facades as pausableAdmin\nV2.1 update brought some logic changes that required Credit Facades to be set as pausableAdmin in ACL. Not doing so would lead to liquidations with loss potentially being blocked under some circumstances.\n\nWhile original V2.1 Credit Facades were set as `pausableAdmin`, they were soon replaced with newer versions, for which this was not done. Therefore, we propose to set USDC and WETH V2 Credit Facades as pausableAdmin in the ACL contract. Note that CMs other than USDC / WETH have no open accounts and can no longer borrow, hence no action is required for them.\n\n## Emergency liquidators\nEmergency liquidators are DAO-appointed addresses that are able to liquidate accounts while contracts are paused. They protect against any bad debt incurred if contracts are paused due to a circuit breaker or manually due to detected suspicious activity. \n\nIt is proposed to set the following addresses as emergency liquidators:\n1) 0x7BD9c8161836b1F402233E80F55E3CaE0Fde4d87\n2) 0x16040e932b5Ac7A3aB23b88a2f230B4185727b0d\n\nThese addresses are EOAs for liquidation bots currently run by the backend initiative.",

      "content": "## Summary:\nThis snapshot vote aims to approve the continuing OBRA framework which lets the DAO function like a decentralized and less controlled, asynchronous organism.\n\n## Proposal:\nThis proposal aims to continue the previously enacted 2023 OBRA framework, based on 3-month cycles. So far, all initiatives have worked reasonably well and delivered timely reports on the work performed and the amounts spent. There has been no abuse of the system so far. The USD amounts and the GEAR amounts are to stay as is, and the benchmark for GEAR bonuses is also believed to be at $150M FDV being $0.015.\n\n**RULE NOTE:** as mentioned in 2023, those who chose the x2 multiplier last year and stayed until now - can now switch to the x1.25 multiplier with the condition of 3 months cliff + 9 months linear vesting. Or they can stay on the x2 multiplier with the condition of 18 months linear vesting which starts in February 2025. The penalty for dropping off early if 2x is chosen will continue staying at 0.5x pro rata, but this time (for the previous contributors) it will be applied from the supposed x1.25 base rate, so x0.5 from x1.25 means that 0.625 of the usual reward is to stay (0.375 is slashed and not a half like before).\nThese members report in the same way as before, as can be seen in Notion. No changes to that system per se, just adding more asynchronicity (is that even a word?). Onboarding a new contributor to the Multiplier System within an initiative can be voted on out of schedule any time, the same goes for off-boarding.\n\n\n| Contributor / Initiatives | Function | USD at x1 / month |\n| ------ | ------ |------ |\n|Mugglesect|Marketing Lead|8000|\n|Amplice|Marketing & Videos|7000|\nNikitakle|Community & DAO Ops|4000|\n|Overkoalafied|Tokenomics Brainiac|5000|\n|Allindots|Illustrator|3000|\n|Harsh|Backend Development|8000|\n|DLTExperts|Fullstack Contributor|25000|\n|Rising Vista|Product and marketing|7000|\n|SC Core Initiative|Development|20000|\n|Frontend Initiative|Development|20000|\n\n\n##### Multisigs as “Guards”\nThe compensation will remain unchanged. 1M GEAR for technical multisig, 1M for financial multisig.\n\n###### [The previous proposal](https://web.archive.org/web/20231001113010/https://gov.gearbox.fi/t/gip-43-obra-dao-governance-framework-cycle-1-feb-april/2303/)\n\n###### [DAO Monthly Reports](https://www.notion.so/Monthly-Reports-6849871a9bae44dfb903531c0a997e8f)\n\n###### [DAO cycle structure](https://www.notion.so/gearboxprotocol/DAO-Initiatives-Cycles-57dea693c7f44c3d9d4d818e5b0ac88b?pvs=4)",

      "content": "One of our key goals with V3 was to reduce the reliance on GEAR emissions and boost organic rates. We took our first step towards that with GIP-85 as we partly the V2 emissions without moving them to V3 pools. Now, as a next step, we intend to completely cut the V2 LM without moving any of that GEAR emissions to V3 pools. And this GIP proposes exactly that. \n\n- Cut the remaining GEAR LM Emissions on V2’s USDC and DAI pools by 100%. This would reduce the GEAR LM by a further of ~24% and 0.36% of the supply annually. \n- No movement of the saved GEAR to V3 pools.\n\n![Screenshot 2024-01-09 at 1.09.40 PM.png](ipfs://bafkreifuu4jhc5njejingalgdpy7ux3oav25zcxw4lobcwdbixutnob2wy)\n\nThe exact details of the savings and the 2nd amendment to GEAR LM is mapped out in the table above. Overall between 1st and 2nd cut, that is about ~1.5% total supply being saved up per year, which is a significant step, [see more here](https://discord.com/channels/841203475606011905/851852630165684225/1189499354772406323).\n\nV3 pools don’t need the additional GEAR emissions since their organic rates make lending sustainable enough, or at least that’s the plan.  This is made possible by leverage side integrations that make higher borrow rates possible without hurting leverage takers. PURE’s first two weeks saw organic rates rise to over 5% at <50% utilisation(cap reached) on the USDC pool. And with V3 farms with higher farming APYs being added next, the organic rates on ETH and other pools is likely to rise too. This is crucial to grow the protocol without disrupting $GEAR inflation and tokenomics. While it’s still early to call it a win, progress is being made in this direction.",

      "title": " [GIP-86] Onboarding new assets & more",
      "content": "Migration from v2 to v3 is active - within a week about 50% of liquidity has already transferred to v3. Time to add more options for Credit Account users. The purpose of this proposal is to add new assets in v3, as well as change some configurations in v2 and v3.\n\n# Specification\n\n## Enabling Minimal Viable Leverage Farming\n\nIn v3, some farms are already available - their goal is to make boosted trading strategies possible. For example, you can go long ETH and use Idle liquidity to deposit into farms. Or you can short ETH and put your stables into Yearn or Maker's sDAI. Let's give now options for delta-neutral farmers:\n\n### WETH pool\n\n| Token | Quota Limit | Liquidation Threshold | Min quota rate, % | Max quota rate, % |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| yvWETH | 15000 ETH | 0.9 | 0.5% | 5% |\n\n### USDC pool\n\n| Token | Quota Limit | Liquidation Threshold | Min quota rate, % | Max quota rate, % |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| sDAI | 30M USDC | 0.9 | 0.5% | 5% |\n| yvUSDC | 4M USDC | 0.9 | 0.5% | 5% |\n| yvDAI | 7M USDC | 0.9 | 0.5% | 5% |\n\n1. This assets should be considered as Tier-1 assets and added to Tier-1 Credit Managers\n2. Quota fees should be set as 0 for all these assets.\n\n_To align parameters it is proposed to set Quote fee=0 for yvWBTC in Tier-1 WBTC Credit Manager (approved in [GIP-81](https://snapshot.org/#/gearbox.eth/proposal/0x529dee318dcdb95b9b9d5172c4cc78fef849434b8bfe42cae534fa9ea842fd82)) and max Quota Rate for stETH in Tier-1 WETH Credit Manager to 3.5%_\n\n## Adjusting current v3 parameters\n\n### Quota Limits\n\nIt is proposed to develop an algorithmic approach to determine Quota Limits:\n\n- min(tvl \\* 0.3, 30M) for farms\n- min(3\\*onchainLiquidity, 30M) for trading assets\n\nThis approach will simplify the determination of limits and at the same time make the system more transparent.\n\nAs result we propose to change current limits for some assets:\n\n| Token | Limit in $ | WBTC\\* pool | WETH\\* pool | USDC pool |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| MKR | 3M | 75 | 1500 | 3M |\n| LDO | 2.5M | 62.5 | 1250 | 2.5M |\n| FXS | 2M | 50 | 1000 | 2M |\n| APE | 0.5M | 12.5 | 250 | 0.5M |\n| yvWETH | 30M | 750 | 15000 | 30M |\n| yvWBTC | 1M | 25 | 500 | 1M |\n| yvUSDC | 4M\\*\\* | 100\\*\\* | 2000 | 4M |\n| sDAI | 30M | 750 | 15000 | 30M |\n\n\\* limits set in underlying asset, so to get parameter value divider 2000 and 40000 is used for ETH and WBTC\n\n\\*\\* yvUSDC is supposed to be added to WBTC pool (Tier-1) to enable boosted trading strategies, quota range for it 0.01%-15%.\n\n## Credit Manager limits\n\nNow the Credit Manager's limits are set to 3M$ (see [GIP-81](https://snapshot.org/#/gearbox.eth/proposal/0x529dee318dcdb95b9b9d5172c4cc78fef849434b8bfe42cae534fa9ea842fd82)). As soon as the 2M$ limit will be reached for Tier-1 Credit Managers it is proposed to increase the limit for the corresponding Credit Manager by an additional 2M$.\n\n## Disabling v2 Credit Managers\n\nWith a decrease in mining liquidity in v2 in GIP-85, liquidity will migrate to v3. Accordingly, there is no need to keep the functionality open, which will soon be fully available in v3. Therefore, it is proposed to stop new borrowings in v2’s Credit Managers\n\n# Voting\n\nSimple Approve/Reject voting",

      "content": "This proposal is aimed at harmonizing the V3 launch and some liquidity parameters related to it. The objective of the proposal is to act on a few data points and thus improve the state of V3 as the migration process is under way, successfully so far. The result would lower emissions in GEAR in the process of potentially driving the emissions to 0% in 2024.\n\n1. Fully remove V2 dWBTC LM. There is currently no utilization, and it’s not needed there. Any passive lender on V2 WBTC can move over to the V3 side. The reason for the WBTC pool existence is to allow traders to either short WBTC or long other coins relative to it (for example, ETH/BTC ratio). Whether that becomes interesting or not is TBD after the product push from mid-end January.\n2. Fully remove V2 WETH LM. That is because V3 Credit Managers can already handle most of the positions that can migrate to V3 from V2. Most of them are in stETH farming, which V3 already can support: https://app.gearbox.fi/strategies/list.\n3. Remove V2 dDAI and dUSDC by 50% in V2. Rates are now better for migration in V3. The other 50% can be removed as soon as V3 Credit Managers can support the other farms for migration, to make sure users don’t have to churn out and have more options than the base functionality mentioned in GIP-86! Planned to be in January.\n\nThis will cut emissions overall by about 30%, which is approximately (since last summer) would be down from 2.6% yearly emissions for passive lending-  to about 1.5%. And the goal is to drive that number to 0%, replacing it with organic rates and better leverage opportunities. In USD terms, that cuts emissions from $2.6M to $1.5M a year!\n\n![2023-12-26 23.47.21.jpg](ipfs://bafkreif554v26kmtuhyspw4cncbpheaqhzgusotablhwbj2mxvj3qmie54)",

      "title": "[GIP-83] Gearbox V3 Reserve Fund",
      "content": "With GIPs 79-80 governance revamp, it was voted to move the fees accumulated so far into a separate fee guard. That is to separate development work from the fees the protocol earns. Those are for holders to decide what to do with. So this is what we need to decide on.\n\nPreviously, those fees (all fees) were taken in the form of dTokens of old pools. They functioned as Reserve Fund for V2, by default as the protocol architecture entails. By moving them away from the designated previous address, V2 won’t have a Reserve Fund anymore. Which is totally logical, because migration is being done in favor of V3, so it’s perfectly correct.\n\nAnyway, back to the point. There is no reason to keep those assets ($600K) in the form of old V2 dTokens. They should either be unwrapped to their underlying assets or instead be repurposed for V3 Reserve Fund as intended. Either of those approaches require an action, and thus, a vote. There are a few ways to go about it without overcomplicating.\n\n- Unwrap all of them and keep them as idle assets for now. Simple. No Reserve Fund to start with, let it accumulate from the start as before starting from nothing.\n- Unwrap all of them and deposit to v3 dTokens passive side. This bootstraps liquidity of V3 as well as creates approximately a ~$600,000 Reserve Fund.\n\nThere are other ways to go about this. In case number 1 wins the vote, further ideas can be discussed. In case number 2 wins the vote, then it’s a settled-and-done matter.\n\nAs always, DAO is able to vote to unwrap incoming fees (in dTokens) to limit its treasury exposure to the Reserve Fund. For example, in case the DAO earns $5M and doesn’t want all the fees to be on the line of Reserve Fund. Gearbox has always worked this way, in fact. This extra note is simply to remind holders of such mechanisms. You can read more in the docs:\n[1. Protocol Fees](https://docs.gearbox.finance/overview/protocol-fees)\n[2.

      "title": "[GIP-82] Partial LM Migration from V2 to V3",
      "content": "## Summary\n\nThis proposal follows the GIP in Discord [which can be found here](https://discord.com/channels/841203475606011905/1181206199149006858/1181206199149006858). This GIP discusses the migration of some of the GEAR rewards from V2 to V3, and is related to the broader launch of Gearbox V3 [(see the relevant snapshot proposal here)](https://snapshot.org/#/gearbox.eth/proposal/0x529dee318dcdb95b9b9d5172c4cc78fef849434b8bfe42cae534fa9ea842fd82)\n\nThe goal of this proposal is to migrate approximately 40% of the Liquidity Mining rewards from V2 passive lending pools to the new V3 passive lending pools. The rates on V2 would likely reduce due to this, but still stay pretty juicy for the next few weeks.\n\nAll the details and the logic on V3 launch steps [can be found here](\nhttps://blog.gearbox.fi/gearbox-protocol-v3-launch-steps-roadmap).\n\n### User Actions: Opt-In\n\nPassive lenders have full control over their capital. Nobody can move their funds without their consent. So if some passive lenders prefer to never withdraw from V2, then be it. However, as the proposal of migrating Liquidity Mining program + organic rates gets approved step-by-step, it might be logical for everyone to jump into V3. A safer, more utilized protocol, hopefully.\n\nWhen you go to the new interface, if you have some V2 passive liquidity, the interface will suggest to you to move it. That’s all, 1-2 buttons at max. Stay in it for ages! \n\n### V3 Pools: USDC, WBTC, ETH\n\nApproximately 40% of the current GEAR rewards would migrate over to the V3 passive lending pools. The pools created at the start would be USDC, WBTC, and ETH. At the emissions rate suggested, 10% APY on such pools in GEAR (discounting any organic rates, which can be high from margin trading) would be:\n\n$4M in ETH: 10% + organic rates\n$4M in USDC: 10% + organic rates\n$2M in WBTC: 10% + organic rates\n\nThat means if the pools are less stocked up than those amounts, the GEAR rates would even be 10%+. If the pools get filled up faster, then the rate might be < 10%. However, V3 has a higher tier structure for lenders to enjoy higher rates, so the goal is to build a protocol which can give at least 10%+ organically, let alone GEAR emissions. Anyway, that's mostly speculation at the moment, and will ultimately depend on usage of v3.\n\n![gear screenshot.png](ipfs://bafkreiebernhmhivu223s5ridicw2f55ynkz5k4yv2qd22qnhu2atywhya)\n\n### Rationale\n\nAs the full article explains, the goal is to take away the “cream” of unutilized liquidity in V2 while V3 is not fully ready with farming just yet. As soon as V3 catches on and gets utilized, the remaining LM can be moved over from V2 to V3 even sooner. Alternatively, in case that process takes too long, then the LM would only be moved once farms are added to V3 in January.\n\nThe goal eventually is to fully remove any emissions once the protocol and its integrations create better borrower opportunities. All the details and the logic on V3 launch steps can be found here: https://blog.gearbox.fi/gearbox-protocol-v3-launch-steps-roadmap\n\n### Math\n\nMy understanding is the latest LM rewards are those referenced in [GIP 30](https://snapshot.org/#/gearbox.eth/proposal/0x3339e33393c8eecea6eb50b8c64599be0229ceba00ed804097b5bbf8991d88e0) and [GIP 68](https://snapshot.org/#/gearbox.eth/proposal/0x4c9a0ce0ec06f941c5a5778dad2994ab2f00507bcb35dcce10f3f544c85f567b). GIP 30 set out the current level of rewards, and GIP 68 simply removed the rewards from the FRAX pool with no further changes. (Unfortunately, as a contributor on the marketing side I am simply too dumb to check the chain).\n\nGiven the above, the current rewards for lenders are as follows: \n![lm rewards 2.png](ipfs://bafkreibd5boh5gcnixpk3eixtexw5a6f6dckydbkhiyclk7iozzghgjhjm)\n    \nMeaning in total, there are currently 98.55 GEAR per block being directed towards V2 lenders. According to this proposal 40% of this will be directed to V3, which means 39.42 GEAR per block. \n\nThese should be split such that 40% of emissions go to ETH, 40% go to USDC, and 20% go to WBTC, such that:\n\n15.768 per block to ETH pool\n15.768 per block to USDC pool\n7.884 per block to WBTC pool\n\n~41150538 per year to ETH pool\n~41150538 per year to USDC pool \n~20575269 per year to WBTC pool.\n\nThis is equivalent (roughly) to 102M of GEAR (1% of supply) per year in total. Given current GEAR prices this (very roughly) corresponds to our \"target\" APYs of 10% on 4m for ETH/USDC and 10% on 2m for WBTC.\n\nV2 pools will each have their rewards reduced by 40% accordingly.\n\n![new per block.png](ipfs://bafkreiawm4stwc6xxzk4l72qtgvgbszuej7mpmq7qalg2dx2atfjaezb7q)\n\n### References\nHere are some old snapshot votes relevant to this proposal\n\n[GIP-68 Frax rewards removal](https://snapshot.org/#/gearbox.eth/proposal/0x4c9a0ce0ec06f941c5a5778dad2994ab2f00507bcb35dcce10f3f544c85f567b)\n\n[GIP-30 LM rewards adjustment](https://snapshot.org/#/gearbox.eth/proposal/0x3339e33393c8eecea6eb50b8c64599be0229ceba00ed804097b5bbf8991d88e0)\n\n[GIP-22 Start of liquidity mining program](https://snapshot.org/#/gearbox.eth/proposal/0x9a6d7ae302241e0132dfd0380a4e20a32eb16fe2c187e54962732eb202a73508)",

      "title": "[GIP-81] Gearbox V3 Launch Parameters",
      "content": "# **[GIP-81] Gearbox V3 Launch Parameters**\n\n# **Summary**\n\nAs discussed earlier (see [ Wen V3... deployment](https://discord.com/channels/841203475606011905/1176892668517814402) and [ V3 Gov & Tokenomics](https://discord.com/channels/841203475606011905/1177177691842166844) discussions on Discord ), it is proposed to launch Gearbox V3 with focus on the Margin Trading use case at first. This does not mean at all that the protocol itself will be focused on this use case only. Quite the contrary, the modular architecture of v3 solves risk management issues and makes the passive lender model more fair in terms of risk/rewards. However, launching a new protocol is always quite a complex task, so we want to reduce this complexity at the time of launch. Shortly after (within a month or two after the launch), leverage farming will also be moved from v2 to v3. Which farms and with what parameters exactly, should be decided and confirmed by the DAO later in December / January. Today, we discuss the setup and parameters for margin trading specifically, and Credit Managers related to it.\n\n# **Specification**\n\n## **AllowedList: Tokens & Protocols**\n\nGearbox Protocol has two key policies: the Allowed Contracts List and the Allowed Tokens List. These policies restrict users from interaction with malicious contracts and specify what assets can be considered as collateral inside a Credit Account. You can read more about policies [here](https://docs.gearbox.finance/overview/credit-account).\n\nIt is proposed to divide allowed tokens into three groups depending on volatility and on-chain liquidity: Tier-1, Tier-2, and Tier-3. Not based on a project quality, but based on the liquidity available for these avenues in the avenues (specific DEXes) which Gearbox can interact with.\n\nThis separation will allow us to implement separate limits for Credit Accounts depending on Assets-tier. These limits are important when liquidating accounts: a one-time liquidation of a big position of low-liquidity asset can lead to high price impact and bad debt (a canonical example of such a case here is the recent CRV case on Aave, fortunately ended well). Separate limits for individual position sizes becomes possible by implementing a separate Credit Manager for each Assets-tier (read more architecture explanations [here](https://dev.gearbox.fi/credit/architecture)).\n\nSafety: the above proposal + collateral limits, truly limit the exposure of the protocol to assets. So let's design the launch in the most safe way possible! It can all be adjusted later.\n\n### Limits\n\n| Tier | Min borrow amount | Max borrow amount |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Tier 1 | 20k$ | 1M$ |\n| Tier 2 | 20k$ | 500k$ |\n| Tier 3 | 20k$ | 200k$ |\n\nThe minimum position size comes from the need to reward the liquidators and depends on the liquidation premium sizes. As liquidation of simple ERC-20 tokens is less gas-expensive (600-700k gas), 20k$ limits should be a fair limit for 4% liquidation premium and 1.5% liquidation fee.\n\nTier 1 assets: WBTC, WETH, stETH, USDC, DAI\n\nTier 2 assets: MKR, UNI, LINK, LDO\n\nTier 3 assets: CRV, CVX, FXS, APE\n\nIt is also proposed to add several farming options so that users can utilize composable leverage advantages - when they can Short or Long and farm at the same time. With this purpose we consider Yearn USDC, WETH and WBTC vaults as well as sDAI. In this specific Credit Managers, farming won't be the main use case. So in order to limit risks, to enable access without Ninja SBT, and to separate use cases - there is no requirement to have all farms here.\n\n## **Open Access - No Ninja SBT**\n\nSpeaking of which, trading-related Credit Managers, if approved, will have no Ninja SBT list. A fully open access without the mumbo jumbo. As for farming Credit Managers a few weeks after launch, it is advised to keep the Ninja SBT model due to the higher safety requirements with farming and large borrow limits. But that will be discussed in a separate proposal later.\n\n## **Protocol Fees**\n\n### APY spread: 25\n\nThe protocol takes a spread fee between the APY which lenders receive and the fee & farmers pay for borrowing their assets. Read [more](https://docs.gearbox.finance/overview/protocol-fees#apy-spread-fee-50). 25 spread value means that 80% of interest paid by borrowers goes to the pool, while 20% to DAO Treasury.\n\n### Liquidation fee & Premium\n\nLiquidation fee & premium are fees applied to liquidated Credit Accounts (fee part goes to Treasury, premium - to liquidator). These parameters stay the same as in v2 - see details in [GIP-20](https://gov.gearbox.fi/t/gip-20-update-fees-interest-rate-curves/1571). Current values are 4% and 1.5%.\n\nIn addition to these parameters, it is proposed to add Quota Fees depending on the type of Credit Manager:\n\n- 0.01% for Tier-1 assets\n- 0.02% for Tier-2 assets\n- 0.05% for Tier-3 assets\n\nDuring the first 3 months, we suggest setting flat 0.01% fees for all assets, and turning on full-fees structure 3 months after v3 launch.\n\n## **Pools and Parameters**\n\nThis section discusses the options for each of the pools. In total it is proposed to create 3 pools: USDC, WBTC, WETH pool. For each pool, below is a list of parameters for each allowed token:\n\n- LT - liquidation threshold represents LTV for this token considered as collateral (read [more](https://docs.gearbox.finance/overview/how-it-works))\n- Quota Limit is total amount of this tokens that can be used as collateral\n- Min/Max quota rates\\*: for using of risky assets as a collateral in Credit Account, user pays an additional fee - Quota Fee. The exact value Quota Fees are defined by Gauges depending on weekly votes of GEAR-stakers, while DAO sets min and max threshold for it.\n\n_\\* It should be noted that the final rate that users will pay is (organicBorrowApy + currentQuotaApy)\\*(1+APYspread)._\n\nAlso at the launch of v3 it is proposed to set limits on the size of the Credit Managers for security purposes: 3M$ limit for each Credit Manager.

      "title": "GIP-79: V3 Governance Framework",
      "content": "## Summary\n\nThis proposal aims at separating different multisig roles and improving V3 governance in preparation for possible L2 deployments, in case the DAO votes for them in early 2024. It also includes a motion to reshuffle guards [multisigs] participants in order to keep the execution of transactions safe and fast. That includes both the technical as well as the treasury guards.\n\n##### 1. Guards [Multisigs] Reshuffle\n\nFirst of all, it’s good to point out that Gearbox security is always improving. Specifically, the addition of timelock last quarter: https://snapshot.org/#/gearbox.eth/proposal/0x42657a818e4ec43dc952f1e73deb3059b21dc0087a84ec058398d0925c16e40c. With this proposal, the motion is to lightly update the signer list with competent signers who are available for the work at stake and have experience. The signers rotating out have requested to be removed due to being too busy with their other commitments, there is no beef. They have been chads, thanks to them. The up-to-date information is here: https://docs.gearbox.finance/governance/setup/guards-multisigs\n\n**Technical Guard:**\n(-) 0xngmi\n(+) Lekhovitsky, Gearbox protocol developer: 0x8cC8c75013D561Ad81D7d08591836Fc78585aE34п\n(+) Ignacio, builder from Stakely: 0xFd660518dC1b52d9F67FAcd42bbBA962B06b8E54\n(+) Van0k, Gearbox protocol developer: 0xb9b7Db94D57fe25907620eAae42b9780176CceeA\n\nStays on 6 but now from 6/12. Emergency guards consisting of the same signers will get the same updates: introducing new signers and removing the ones who opted out.\n\n**Treasury Guard:**\n(-) Allan\n(+) NDW from Castle Capital: 0xC16C60fcDe4c2D4B4C53bE2680602d6938aC9eC9\n\nStays as 5/9.\n\n##### 2. Veto Admin role creation\n\nAs the article on the new V3 framework points out, there is a possibility for a veto admin role. This role functions as a rapid-response (3/12) multisig, capable of flagging a transaction. It’s designed to provide a swift reaction in cases where an added transaction is identified as erroneous or malicious. It can later on be separated to have different signing members.\n\n##### 3. Fee Treasury Guard [Multisig]\n\nV3 framework also features a possibility to have a different destination for fees coming from V3 (V1 and V2 can’t change and will continue streaming into the same destination as before). The new multisig can later on be repurposed for whatever the DAO decides to do with the fees, separate from the foundation operational budget which was secured with the DAO rounds in 2022. The signer list for this multisig can later on be updated after subsequent votes if any.\n\nThis motion also includes transferring the fees obtained so far (around $613,000 over V1 and V2) to that same fee multisig. That will keep the activity of the foundation and developers separate from fee accrual and possible token models. Those fees are easy to calculate from V1 and V2, because they were taken in the form of Gearbox passive LP tokens, aka diesel dTokens: https://debank.com/profile/0x7b065fcb0760df0cea8cfd144e08554f3cea73d1.",

      "title": "[GIP-76] Modify Pools Interest rate curve to two-point model",
      "content": "[GIP-76] Modify Pools Interest rate curve to two-point model\n\n\n## Motivation\n\nThis proposal aims to change the interest rate curve (utilization curve) for lenders & borrowers. The same exact model is proposed to be used in v3 in the future (those can be considered this proposal as part of the transition to v3, the main proposals for which will be in subsequent GIPs).\n\nThe new mode should majorly improve user experience when it comes to sudden increases of rates. For example, previously, when a new Credit Account was opened or closed to utilization 1-tick, the rates would skyrocket or drop instantly. That is because the state of the curve was either cheap to borrow or insanely expensive to borrow. That made decision-making for both users confusing. With the new model, it introduces three states essentially: cheap to borrow, high but acceptable rate for borrowing, and insanely expensive to borrow. \n\n## Suggestion\n\nAs you know, interest rates in Gearbox Protocol are defined using a two-point piecewise linear function https://docs.gearbox.finance/lending-market/pools-and-apy#how-to-calculate-apy. \n\nThis function is actively used in DeFi (see Aave, Compound and other lending markets). However, like any solution, it has drawbacks. In Gearbox, the interest rates were calculated so that the utilization was close to the optimal utilization. This was successful for long periods of time (see https://dune.com/apeir99n/gearbox-protocol-dashboard), however, it also gave an undesirable sharp increase in APY when the whale withdrew a significant amount (~1M+). For such cases, it is desired to have a more gradual increase in the interest rate, since a sharp increase in the rate leads to all users of Credit Accounts receiving losses in their leverage farming strategies.\n\nTo overcome this drawback, it is proposed to consider a 2-point interest rate curve:\n1. If pool utilization is less than U_1, r(u) = r_0+ u/U_1 * (r_1-r_0), where r_0,r_1,U_1 are some constants\n2. If pool utilization is in the interval [U_1,U_2], then r(u)=r_1+(u-U_1)*(r_2-r_1)/(U_2-U_1), where r_2,U_2 are some constants\n3. If utilization is greater than U_2, then r(u)=r_2+(u-U_2)*(r_3-r_2)/(1-U_2), where r_3 is also a constant.\n \n    \n    \nSuch a curve model will make it possible to select parameters such that most of the time the pool is in the interval around [U_1-delta,U_2], thereby avoiding sharp jumps in the interest rate (in the interval [U_1,U_2] the interest rate grows faster than in the interval [0, U_1], but still not as aggressive as in the interval [U_2,1]).\n\n## Parameters\n\nAs part of the transition to the 2-point model, it is proposed to use the following parameters: \n\n|Asset pool|r_0|r_1|r_2|r_3|U_1|U_2|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|USDC|0|1|1.25|100|70|90|\n|DAI|0|1|1.25|100|70|90|\n|FRAX|0|1|1.25|100|70|90|\n|ETH|0|2|2.5|60|70|90|\n|wstETH|0|2|2.5|60|70|90|\n|WBTC|0|2|2.5|60|70|90|\n\n\n\nThis will allow the target utilization value to be targeted at ~70%, while at the same time short-term increases in utilization up to 90% will not lead to a dramatic increase in interest rates.\n\n\n## Specification\n1. Deploy new two-point LinearInterestRateModel for USDC, DAI, FRAX v1 pools\n2. Deploy new two-point LinearInterestRateModel for ETH, WBTC, wstETH v1 pools\n3. Set new model as model for USDC pool with poolService.updateInterestRateModel() call\n4. Set new model as model for FRAX pool with poolService.updateInterestRateModel() call\n5. Set new model as model for DAI pool with poolService.updateInterestRateModel() call\n6. Set new model as model for WETH pool with poolService.updateInterestRateModel() call\n7. Set new model as model for wstETH pool with poolService.updateInterestRateModel() call\n8. Set new model as model for WBTC pool with poolService.updateInterestRateModel() call\n9. Update lower bound of yvWETH price feed\n10. Update lower bound of crvCVXETH price feed\n11. Update lower bound of crvUSDETHCRV price feed\n\nETA 18 oct 2023 15:00 CET\n\n# Voting\n\nSimple Approve / Reject",

An audit ensures the security and stability of our contracts and provides the community with confidence in v3.\nThe extra budget is required because there were additional fixes and changes, outside of the initial scope, given the recent Curve V2 and Balancer issues surfacing in August. it would be the final codebase that gets a full audit, hence a higher budget is required to the scope being increased.\n\n## Budget Breakdown\nThe total budget for final review includes 130,000 USDC payment and 2’222’222.22 GEAR tokens (~10k$) with 1 year cliff lockup. \nPost-audit, the community can expect a detailed audit report, highlighting any vulnerabilities found and their severity.

There can and should be more SC teams as the DAO grows. DLT Experts remains as the high level architectural view and guidance, with the SC Core Initiative focusing on day-to-day development, Router and audit-related tasks.\n\n## Budget\n20k$/monthly compensation and the corresponding amount in $GEAR depending on their multiplier choice.

While LT=0 should prevent any borrowing against these pools' LP tokens, we want to completely remove any possible attack vectors.\n2) LT = 0 and ZeroPriceFeed's will be set for cvxcrvCRVETH, stkcvxcrvCRVETH, in addition to the Curve token\n3) Without the old CRV pool, the users wouldn't have any option to swap their reward CRV into the underlying WETH, since the new CM doesn't support Uniswap. Therefore, we need to add an adapter for the new [TriCRV](https://curve.fi/#/ethereum/pools/factory-tricrypto-4/deposit) pool to the new WETH CM. This pool will only support swaps - there is currently no readily available price feed for crvUSD, so the LP token can't be safely priced. The LP token itself will also be added (this is needed for compatibility), but will have LT=0 and ZeroPriceFeed set for it.",

      "content": "# Motivation\n\nWith the growth of the DAO and the emergence of new initiatives, it becomes increasingly important to decentralize and desynchronize processes further. To this end, GIP-43 proposed the use of OBRA framework and fund separate initiatives independently.\n\nSo, TechOps Initiative, Business Development Initiative, RiskDAO initiatives and others were formed. And now it seems it's time to reframe frontend development as a separate initiative: once v3 is launched, initiative will be working on two semi-independent interfaces - one for trading, the other a basic (& focused more on leverage farmers) interface.\n\nIn addition, a separate interface for analytics (charts.gearbox.fi) and Gearbox Risk Framework https://risk.gearbox.foundation/ (that is covered by Risk DAO though) should be supported. I propose to separate this scope into a separate initiative - Front initiative.\n\n\n# Front initiative configuration\n\nThe team consists of three full- and one part-time initiative contributors. As of the publishing of this proposal, two headcounts are semi-open (I have candidates, waiting approval of budget from DAO to finally onboard them). \n\n## Initiative Members\n\n| Position |Unit|\n| --- | --- | \n| **Full Time** | |\n| - Initiative Lead |1|\n| - Senior Frontend developer |1|\n| - Middle Frontend developer |1|\n| **Part Time** | |\n| - UX designer| 0.25-0.5|\n| **Team Total** | 3.25-3.5 |\n\n\n# Budget\n\n20k$/monthly* compensation and the corresponding amount in $GEAR depending on their multiplier choice, determined using a system of multipliers from GIP-43.\nAdditional 10k$/yearly budget for HR expenses. Out of this, the finder fee to an external unrelated platform will have to be paid for securing new members for this initiative. This is typically referred to as the finder’s fee in HR.\n\nCurrent costs of contributors related to frontend development is ~17-18k$. As such, there is no large increase in funding related to this initiative despite new members joining. Obviously, the contributors related to frontend who are now on the multiplier system with some others, will move into this asynchronous initiative separately. That means the costs are not -20k/monthly - but rather -3k/monthly only.\n\nIt is assumed that this initiative is automatically extended if there is no separate vote on its adjustment.

      "title": "[GIP-68] Remove FRAX LM rewards",
      "content": "FIP-119 by Frax DAO, thanks to Samuel's help and the chad Frax contributors (https://gov.frax.finance/t/fip-119-create-gearbox-amo/1887) - established a Frax -> Gearbox AMO with a starting limit of 2M. To help bootstrap this as strategy from the Gearbox side, LM rewards were added to this passive lending pool, with GIP-30: https://gov.gearbox.fi/t/gip-30-lm-adjustment-1/1875. _The rewards for FRAX are 0.168% GEAR of total supply yearly, or ~80K USD yearly currently. Not huge at current levels, but just pointing out._\n\nDue to high borrow min limits for Credit Accounts, minimum sizes of CAs started at about $400K. Meaning that a pool needs to be at least $1M to serve just 2 users. That was the case with a $5M+ pool servicing a few CAs, but recently the pool was dropping and is now at a level where it's not particularly beneficial for the protocol. Even if it grows back to $3M, it presents fragmentation which isn't particularly relevant in this environment of liquidity constrains.\n\nThis is normal to see in these conditions, and this is one of the reasons why P2P lending or small multiple pools are hardly usable in isolation: it's hard to match both sides especially due to high collateral requirements. As such, the pool currently has no benefit to Gearbox Protocol. Nothing wrong with either protocol, just it's the time when users & protocols rethink their priorities and rates.\n\n**Suggestion: remove LM for now, revisit in V3 in a better way.**\n\nIn V3, we can all rethink the pros & cons of adding back LM to Frax depending on what use cases of leverage Gearbox users find most interesting. Currently, these emissions bring no benefit to Gearbox whether in marketing or usage ways now.\n\nPS: this will not remove the pool, there is no need for that. It's just logical that the liquidity wouldn't grow further anymore, for now, similar to wstETH pool. Which exists, but is not used.",

The required changes are about maintaining the protocol and are not related to the elimination of potential attack vectors.

      "content": "This is in reference to [GIP-22](https://snapshot.org/#/gearbox.eth/proposal/0x9a6d7ae302241e0132dfd0380a4e20a32eb16fe2c187e54962732eb202a73508), which started the LM program last year. Part of the LM program focussed on incentivising Credit Account users with GEAR rewards. It was done for the sake of early user appreciation and GEAR distribution, not as a financial incentive as it was too small even on day 0. At this point, these numbers are small and don’t present any benefit.\n\nAnother reasoning is that with the arrival of Curve V2 pools and then V3 - leverage opportunities will become multiplied. Meaning that **Credit Accounts in V3 will have more farms, trading options, and better avenues for making higher yields!** Organic traction should be expected there, whereas any small incentives would not help the product while might distort outside interpretation of traction. Moreover, with V3 changing the architecture, doing such rewards in a semi-manual day would have been very cumbersome. Overall, all reasons point to cutting it.\n\nNo other rewards are currently being cut. Both passive lender side and GEAR/ETH are live.\n\nThus, it makes sense to optimize our token spends and remove Credit Account token spends. **As the protocol improves and goes into V3 and on Layer 2 rollups, it would be ideal to see GEAR emissions to almost fully be cut.** However, it’s not the time for it yet given the early stage of Gearbox and industry yields. Once the situation changes, turning emissions into burning / redistribution is the desired outcome. And efforts are being done to achieve that.\n\nThis will save 0.196% of the supply on an annual basis, equal to $100K yearly.",

While other approaches are already under work, effective SEO practices can significantly impact our brand visibility, community reach and fulfillment of specific objectives (LLSD push, Leverage on Curve V1 & V2 push etc). Effective SEO establishes organic flow of traffic to the protocol and ecosystem if done right and in advance. An initiative around setting up SEO will be useful, led by Thijs. They’d come in with a strong background in SEO and related content strategy, with experience across multiple projects. \n\n### Roles and Responsibilities:\n\nThijs will have SEO specific responsibilities, few of them being: \n\n- Helping set up SEO systems: SEO specific blog as well as the best mechanism to integrate it into our current content strategy. \n- Keyword Research: conducting comprehensive keyword research to identify relevant search terms and trends. Deciding on the relevant ones for now and our upcoming additions (Trading, Curve etc).\n- Content Strategy Development: Using existing content pieces to create frameworks for the new blog.\n- Thijs work could further extend to backlinks, analysis of the output and other SEO related activities basis requirement.\n- Thijs would potentially work on other web2-style user acquisition channels together with the marketing initiative.\n\n### Proposal\n\nThe monthly approved budget for this initiative will be 2,500 USDC. No $GEAR to be granted. The approval will be for the quarter while payments will be for the months with meaningful activity. The initiative is to be discontinued if either Thijs or the marketing initiative members decide to break off the engagement.",

      "content": "### Aim:\n\nThis proposal aims to mitigate risk of centralisation posed by the structure of USDC and also improve the degree of decentralisation of the treasury assets with LUSD. This is to be done by allocating part of the treasury USDC to LUSD.\n\n### Background:\n\nCurrently, the treasury holds 3.615M USDC. While USDC is a well-established and widely used stablecoin, its value is backed by a centralised custodian system, which introduces potential counterparty risk through banking systems. As the DeFi landscape continues to evolve, it is important for Gearbox DAO to explore safe alternative stablecoin options that align with the ethos of decentralisation. And LUSD offers exactly that.\n\n### About LUSD:\n\nLUSD by Liquity is an algorithmic stablecoin designed to maintain its peg to the US dollar. It achieves this through collateralized debt positions (CDPs). Unlike USDC, which relies on centralised custodians and traditional banking systems, LUSD is backed by ETH as collateral. Depositors can borrow up to a collateralization ratio of 110. The position is liquidated once the ratio falls below.\n\nLUSD in operation has been able to maintain peg throughout and usually has had a premium to its price. The following article outlines its working and peg mechanism: https://www.liquity.org/blog/the-premium-of-resiliency. From a safety PoV, LUSD is a safe decentralised stable to diversify into.\n\n### Proposal:\n\nThe proposed diversification of Gearbox DAO's treasury from USDC to LUSD presents an opportunity to reduce treasury risk and embrace decentralisation. The option that has the highest votes post reaching quorum will be the one implemented by the DAO.",

      "title": "[GIP-63] Add Curve v2 farms to WETH pool",
      "content": "### Abstract\nThis is a suggestion to add Curve v2 pools into the Allowed List / AllowedContracts for Credit Account users, applicable to WETH pool.\n\n### Motivation\nThe current problem (or rather, a situation dictated by the early stage of Gearbox Protocol) stems from the current leverage opportunities being very limited. Curve and Convex safe pools have long been not paying much, which is reasonable: lower risk = lower pay. What that leads to is: low rates available for leverage strategies → low max interest rate borrowers are prepared to pay → low participation on the passive lending side. It’s obvious, I know. How to fix it?\n\nLeverage opportunities must grow, so must composability. As we always envisioned! The better the rates and profits leverage borrowers can make - the higher the borrow rates they can pay. Below are table with current APYs for some targeted farms:\n| Pool                         | Current APY  \n|----------------|-------------------------------|\n| 3crypto Curve+Convex | 5.9%\n| CRV/ETH Curve+Convex | 14.2%\n| CVX/ETH Curve+Convex | 12.3%\n| LDO/ETH Curve+Convex | 13.4%\n\n### Specification\nNew farms will be added into a separate Credit Manager (“Experimental”) in order to add limits to it. It breaks composability a bit (users can’t switch between old farms and new strategies within the same Credit Account), but allows us to test these hypotheses before the V3 launch.\n\n1. Overall Borrow Limit for Credit Manager: 2800WETH (~5M$).\n\n2. Allowed Tokens & Liquidation Thresholds:\n\n|Token                     |LT\n|----------------|-------------------------------|\n|Curve/Convex 3crypto|88%\n|WBTC|85%\n|USDT|85%\n|CRV| 25%\n|CVX| 25%\n|Curve/Convex CVX/ETH| 82%\n|Curve/Convex CRV/ETH| 82%\n|Curve/Convex LDO/ETH| 82%\n|LDO| 25%\n\n3. Cap Limits per Credit Account\n\nKeep the same limits as for Current WETH Credit Manager.\n\n### Price feed\nFor Curve v2 pools is own price oracle is used ([see code](https://github.com/Gearbox-protocol/integrations-v3/blob/main/contracts/oracles/curve/CurveCryptoLPPriceFeed.sol)). It was audited by Chainsecurity. As price feed for other tokens Chainlink is used.\n\nNote: existing LDO price feed should be replaced to CompositePriceFeed.\n\n### Interest rate curve\nif proposal succeeded, we can predict that utilization moves from current farm pools (which are mostly in staking derivatives) to new added ones and farmers will be ready to pay higher APYs, while current farms will become un-profitable. Accordingly, it will be necessary to change the Interest rate curve’s parameters [link to it](https://docs.gearbox.finance/lending-market/pools-and-apy#how-to-calculate-apy), but the question is how to do it in best way. So proposal here to keep current rates and adjust them in a week after new farms going live.",

At the inception of the DAO Foundation, it was mentioned that any contributor could potentially ask for this.\n\n### Onboarding DLTExperts\nThis proposal sets forth the creation of the Gearbox Protocol Development Initiative (GPDI), designed to lead technical efforts and encourage talented developers to contribute to the protocol. Given budgetary and planning limitations, the initiative is anticipated to begin with a single member.\n\nOnboard DLTExperts Ltd. with the multiplier system, it would be 25,000 USDC at 1x. No extra GEAR to be granted.\n\nThe goal & mission of this initiative is to:\n\n* Assist with the smart contracts and general architecture as consultancy\n* Compensate for some of the maintenance work to be performed by DLTExperts Ltd.\n* Other efforts which could be assisted by DLTExperts Ltd.\n\n### Contracts for doomsower, Rising Vista, …\nAt the request of contributors themselves, they asked to be given contractor agreements. The DAO Foundation has the capacity to do so if the voters decide it’s fine to do so. There is no change of compensation here, it simply is a formalization of the already existing relationship.",

      "content": "### Summary\nAllocate $10k in GEAR tokens for August 2023 to incentivize users of EXMO to supply assets to Gearbox passive pools. The amount of GEAR rewards is fixed in USDT terms (10,000 USDT) and distributed at the end of the 30-day supply period.\n\n### Motivation\nEXMO is a regulated crypto exchange founded in 2014. The company is based in the UK, Ukraine, Poland, and Lithuania. The exmo.com cryptocurrency platform has more than 6,000 active monthly traders, 166 trading pairs, an exchange token EXMO Coin (EXM) and operates with 4 fiat currencies. Currently, the average daily trading volume is ≈$80 million.\n\n* In July 2023 EXMO launches an Earn program which at its fist stage will enable users to supply assets to Gearbox’s passive pools\n* EXMO commits to supply $200k to Gearbox passive pools for 2 months\n* EXMO will host an AMA with a member of Gearbox DAO & prepare infographics re the risks & benefits of aping into Gearbox passive pools\n* EXMO will send emails & push notifications to its 1mln+ users re this opportunity\n* EXMO will issue NFTs (as a member badge via POAP) and raffle off $1000 in EXM among those who have kept a deposit for more than 60 days.\n\nThese activities should increase the TVL of the protocol and awareness about Gearbox among normies that trade on EXMO. If the results of the Earn program satisfy both parties, we’ll discuss the next steps to strengthen the partnership e.g. via adding GEAR/USDT pair on the spot exchange & introducing GEAR-ETH liquidity provision to users of EXMO.\n\n### More details\n##### Accumulating and supplying assets\nAs the first “yield farming” phase of the Earn program EXMO enables users to supply USDC, DAI and USDT. The supply limit per user is from $200 to $1000. To entice new users EXMO promises 65% APR for the first 30 days which will be effectively subsidized by GEAR tokens. Also, the UI will enable users to automatically re-supply assets at a current passive pool rate after the yield farming period is over. EXMO will clearly state the risks associated with a such investment (smart contract risk, oracle risk, governance risk, etc).\n\n##### Withdrawing assets & distributing rewards\nAfter the 30-day yield farming period is over the users are eligible to withdraw. If a user doesn’t withdraw, the assets remain in the passive pool, earning a market yield and are available for withdrawal after a short “cooldown” period.",

      "content": "\nThis proposal aims to request a budget from the DAO in size of 481,500 USDC, in order to pay for the v3 audits. This amount is to be split between 2 audit firms: ABDK (327 300 USDC) and Chainsecurity (154 200 USDC). The audits have been scheduled at the end of May/early June - with the completion time estimated to be the very end of summer 2023.\n\n# Gearbox v3 - a lot of cool new features coming…\n\n* Quotas and limits on asset exposure, enabling medium- and long-tail assets;\n* Support for bots with granular permissions controls, for automation of position management;\n* Minimum viable tokenomics - being able to control the revenue split ratio between LPs and Ninjas with GEAR;\n* Several new protocol integrations;\n* ERC4626 pools;\n* Partial withdrawals;\n* Numerous security improvements, tweaks and optimizations;\n\nThese changes affect the core of the protocol and should be properly audited accordingly. Gearbox has always made security a top priority, so our vision here is that any core changes should be verified by at least two good audit companies. The reason why the numbers are so high is that the Gearbox codebase is quite complex and large, as such, it’s a big piece of work. Anyone in the DAO is free to verify these quotes, as these numbers are standard across the top-5 auditing firms.\n\n# Terms & Proposal\n\n## Chainsecurity audit\n\nChainsecurity will allocate 3 business ­weeks from MAY 30TH, 2023 TO JUNE 16TH, 2023 to review smart contracts for the Project. After reviewing the codebase, Chainsecurity will provide a report or communicate the findings and recommendations as usual. To be found in [Audits & Bug Bounty - Gearbox Protocol](https://docs.gearbox.finance/risk-and-security/audits-bug-bounty). Audit cost is 135 420 CHF. Payment can be done in crypto USDC/USDT with small premium to cover exchange fees (up to 1.5%), so the budget for Chainsecurity Audit is ~154 200 USDC. Exact USD amount is to be calculated and presented by Chainsecurity (in this forum topic) on the day of transfer. For exchange rate, they will quote the final price to be sent.\n\nAddress for payment (USDC/USDT ERC20): 0x8baf5eaf92e37cd9b1fccd676918a9b3d4f87dc7\n\n## ABDK audit\n\nABDK will allocate x weeks from 1 June to 1 August 2023 to review smart contracts. Report will be provided and deployed in [Audits & Bug Bounty - Gearbox Protocol](https://docs.gearbox.finance/risk-and-security/audits-bug-bounty). The cost is based on the evaluation of code lines amount (both code lines and comment lines). Audit cost estimation is $284670 (for 10147 code lines and 4400 comment lines). Exact USD amount is to be calculated closer to the audit start date after code freeze. At the moment, developers are more engaged in writing tests and polishing of contracts, so the changes from the current number of lines should be small. Therefore, it is proposed to add 15% to the budget in case of a slight increase in the number of lines. The final number of lines and exact audit cost will be published here by ABDK after code freeze.",

      "title": "[GIP-57] Set up OHM lending pool",
      "content": "This discussion-proposal calls for:\n- adding OHM passive lending pool to Gearbox, and \n- setting up parameters for OHM pool's Credit Managers whereas that also involves partial implementation (finally) of https://gov.gearbox.fi/t/gip-47-add-mim-curve-mim-and-convex-mim-pools/2331/\n\n# Motivation\n\nOlympus DAO has been focusing on OHM's price stability over the past year. Instead of high staking APY and high price volatility in the past, an algorithmic open market module ('Range Stability') has been deployed, helping to stabilize OHM around a floating price target. More details on bonds mechanism you can find [here](https://docs.google.com/document/u/1/d/e/2PACX-1vSIufbgAxAAtZkITd_s57o5AmyhAnk6iYbLYvN-ATL59hQ5nC2t2BTPvA8X9DYzFa-i3PRw9ARrAS9E/pub). As you can see, these improvements help OHM price be more stable during last 180 days: \n\n![fe8881a8da7fb34a7d7415cc61409e42c9145180_2_1380x800.png](ipfs://bafkreighy5jkd4p62wc4qkmfjckstmmrm525xhwpka6vmcgueq3kjiuzl4)\n    \n\n# Proposal\n\n### 1. Deploy OHM passive lending pool \nThat is to be freely available to anyone to passively lend their OHM like other pools we currently have:\n\nhttps://app.gearbox.fi/pools/\n\nOlympus Community launches AMO Lending proposal to serve as minimum liquidity level for Gearbox OHM passive pool (see details [here](https://forum.olympusdao.finance/d/2960-oip-140-gearbox-lending-amo)). **Thus, directly contributing to TVL & Gearbox Protocol growth <3**\n\nVery cool!\n\n### 2. Caps: both per CA and overall on pool\n\nSet Max cap for OHM pool: 500,000 OHM (more so a random large number), while for Credit Accounts users' borrow amount in the range of 15k-100k OHM (equal to $150K-$1M worth). The limits for personal caps is similar to [existing limits in stablecoin pools](https://docs.gearbox.finance/liquidity-providers/pools-and-apy#current-pool-caps-as-per-latest-gip-voting).\n\nThe logic behind overall cap on pool is to limit potential exposure for new asset. On the one side, OHM has ~60M liquidity on DEXes and internal logic of price stabilization. On the other side, most liquidity is in CFMM-like Balancer pools and in the case of a malfunction of the OHM stabilization mechanisms, we can end up with >10% slippage for 500+k OHM. *To be honest, this is unlikely, but over the past year we have seen many unlikely events. Better start safer.*\n\n### 3. GEAR emissions\n\nThe goal of this proposal partly is to grow DAO to DAO relations and offer different strategies (due to a new lending pool) to leverage ninja side, amongst other things. When such a move was done previously, Frax pool being first of that kind - received support from Gearbox DAO so they + their holders would earn extra yields. It's hard to speak to the efficiency of that move, given the pool is relatively small (https://etherscan.io/address/0x79012c8d491dcf3a30db20d1f449b14caf01da6c) - so it's somewhat subjective on how one can view this.\n\nKeeping it an open question on how much GEAR issuance Gearbox DAO is ready to give to this pool, referencing https://gov.gearbox.fi/t/gip-30-lm-adjustment-1/1875/15 for the current numbers on other pools. In this case, **OHM avenues for making %% are not vast, so doing any non-trivial amount of GEAR emissions could potentially attract good passive lending sizes. Could be a good strategy!** \n\nOur proposal is to add 2.85GEAR/block (~140k GEAR/week) LM rewards for OHM pool targeting for +3% GEAR APY for 250k OHM pool. \n\n### 4. Interest rate curve\n\nGearbox Pools use Aave-like interest rate curve depending on Pool's utilization ratio. Read more [here](https://docs.gearbox.finance/liquidity-providers/pools-and-apy). In V3, this curve is expected to be improved, see more in https://medium.com/gearbox-protocol/gearbox-v3-teaser-redefining-leverage-and-lending-ff62034e8a34.\n\nParameters for OHM pool are suggested following:\n\n|r0|r1|r2|U*|\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|0|4|100|80|\n\nThe choice of parameters based on the farming APY in the pools Convex/Curve pools, which will be available in v2. The reasoning for a higher R1 is the ability to leverage into MIM strategies which currently yield the most from [what is enabled in Gearbox V2](https://docs.gearbox.finance/overview/credit-account/allowedlist-policy). As such, if one were to expect this strategy<>pool link to be popular, a higher R1 due to availability of superior yields seems justified. See more in #6. \n\n###  5. Protocol fees \nLiquidation fee & premium, interest rate spread parameter, read more in [docs](https://docs.gearbox.finance/overview/protocol-fees#apy-spread-fee) is suggested to keep same as for other pools: \n- Liquidation fee: 1.5%\n- Liquidation premium: 4%\n- Interest rate fee: 50\n\n### 6. Add assets and set up LTs for OHM pool\n\n|Token|OHM pool LT (%)|\n| --- | --- |\n|WETH|75|\n|stETH|75|\n|WBTC|75|\n|USDC|85|\n|DAI|85|\n|FRAX|85|\n|USDT|85|\n|sUSD|85|\n|gUSD|85|\n|LUSD|85|\n|MIM|85|\n|FRAX3CRV-f|85|\n|cvxFRAX3CRV-f*|85|\n|3Crv|85|\n|cvx3Crv*|85|\n|LUSD3CRV-f|85|\n|cvxLUSD3CRV-f*|85|\n|crvPlain3andSUSD|85|\n|cvxcrvPlain3andSUSD*|85|\n|gusd3CRV|85|\n|cvxgusd3CRV|85|\n|crvFRAX|85|\n|cvxcrvFRAX|85|\n|**mim3CRV**|85|\n|**cvxmim3CRV**|85|\n|CVX|25|\n|FXS|25|\n|LQTY|0|\n|CRV|25|\n|LDO|0|\n|SNX|25|\n\n> For reference, you can see other LTs here: https://docs.gearbox.finance/overview/credit-account/allowedlist-policy#allowed-contracts-list\n\nAbove, you can see proposed final deployment-addition of the MIM assets, which was already approved in https://gov.gearbox.fi/t/gip-47-add-mim-curve-mim-and-convex-mim-pools/2331/. However, due to V3 work and inability of grantees to execute the deployment within the last few weeks, this task was delayed. That is suboptimal but is already being worked on to be improved in the future, see https://medium.com/gearbox-protocol/gearbox-v2-evolution-evaluation-and-what-next-feb8c4127af6. Sumimasen.\n\n**The idea is to implement MIM in this OHM pool specifically, for now:** that helps test a more riskier asset pair on smaller amounts, as well as keeps MIM as a more potentially interesting integration for the V3 Alpha Pool, where high leverage ninja earnings can better be relayed to the passive lending APYs. Currently, due to 1-point utilization curve, that doesn't work well, so the integration would be a bit of a *waste* from the product development point of view. If you disagree, please debate below. \n\nAlso  it's good to notice that after v2.1 is going live other OHM farming options can be added, for example Convex OHM/FRAXBP or Balancer/Aura OHM/DAI and OHM/wstETH.  \n\n> It's worth pointing out that having a OHM/FRAXBP style (but without lockups required as 24/7 liquidity is needed for possible liquidations) leverage integrated for Allowed List of Gearbox would be a good avenue for this pool. Anyone with experience could actually take upon this task and make the integration possible sooner! \n\n# Voting \n\nSimple voting Approve / Reject / Abstain.",

      "content": "# PROPOSAL\nIncrease GEAR/wETH liquidity curve v2 pool mining rewards from 3.33m GEAR/month to 6.66m GEAR/month. The rewards will run until the end of the year unless replaced by a new tokenomics model.\n\n# CONTEXT\n### But we just changed this in GIP-49! (Context)\nYes. Essentially in [[GIP-49]](https://gov.gearbox.fi/t/gip-49-extend-gear-weth-liquidity-mining/2391/7) We f*ked around and found out.\n\n![image](ipfs://bafkreidx5g3o4srvxdyx4tvuvwwuehu6aih7swzx3x5jaszocqznm62avm)\n    \nSince GIP-49, the previous veCRV voters have left the pool, and altcoins have lost value vs ETH. It is a real possibility that if nothing changes GEAR/wETH liquidity could drop below $1m. This is equivalent to 4 months of diesel LM - ie, could create significant sell pressure. Additionally, $1m liquidity is somewhat of a mental barrier of \"legitimacy\" for liquidity. Increasing the rewards back to 6.66m GEAR/month can shore up the liquidity to weather further adverse conditions while still representing a minor net increase to liquidity mining emissions.\n\nFor reference - diesel LM program is currently 23m gear/month. This proposal would represent a net 12% increase to the liquidity mining program across diesel pools and GEAR/wETH pools. \n\n### Alternative Configurations\nThere are two potential alternatives: Switching the rewards to veCRV or vlCVX bribes, or switching liquidity to a balancer boosted pool. \n\nSwitching rewards to veCRV or vlCVX bribes would offer a slightly multiplier (historically around 1-1.5x) on efficiency, however it would mean farmers are receiving CRV and CVX, and voters recieve GEAR, thus making LPers unable to accumulate GEAR thru LM. This is a smaller form of f*k around and find out, but ultimately only represents a marginal increase for once again potentially unknown downsides.\n\nSwitching to a boosted pool could potentially achieve the same liquidity with 40% less emissions (slightly better outcome than the veCRV/vlCVX bribe multiplier) . However, this would require existing LPs to migrate to Balancer and accept the new APR, and also have confidence that nothing else will change in the near future. Usually getting new liquidity requires boosted APR for a period of time. Given there are ongoing discussions around potential locked liquidity 80/20 pools and other tokenomics, less change is better and liquidity providers will be far more likely to remain in the curve pool, and likely accept a slightly reduced APR, than they would be to migrate to a new pool with only a slightly higher APR. Therefore, once again the potential downside of f*king around and finding out is not worthwhile. \n\n# Voting\nSimple for/against/abstain.",

      "content": "### Summary\nThis is porposal to start the Gearbox TechOps Initiative, which will maintain technical operations support of the protocol. At the moment, this initiative (starting from April) is being handled by **manylov**.\n\n### Motivation\nWith the growth of the Gearbox protocol the workload on the development team in terms of operational support for the operation of the protocol has increased. Of course, the system itself works completely on-chain, contracts are immutable (although DAO can change various system parameters). However, a number of features require operational support: in particular, adding new pools, onboarding new assets, changing the parameters of current [Policies](https://docs.gearbox.finance/overview/credit-account/allowedlist-policy), etc. These tasks do not require the development of code from scratch, however, they are quite sensitive (as well as any on-chain changes).\n\nAccordingly, with the growth of the protocol, an additional level of operational complexity arises: the current team is busy with v3 (and will always be busy with new things), while it is necessary to correctly deploy the existing audited code and avoid stupid error. To solve this problem, it is required to start the operational subDAO unit (for example, similar to the TechOps Core Unit in MakerDAO https://forum.makerdao.com/t/mip40c3-sp88-techops-core-unit-dai-budget/ ).\n\n### Budget\n5000 USDC/per month + bonus package according to OBRA framework (2x multiplier).\n\n### Additional expenses\nThe budget for Tenderly-Pro (x), which I propose to pay for Gearbox Foundation in addition to GIP-46 is not defined yet, we will use an extended trial for one month, then get a final price from the Tenderly team and make additional proposal.",

The core system parameters, such as asset LTs, fees, etc. will not be changed, but some new security parameters will be added (see below). All changes are [audited by Chainsecurity](https://github.com/Gearbox-protocol/security/blob/main/audits/2023%20Apr%20-%20Chainsecurity%20v2.1%20.pdf).\n\nFor motivation and an in-depth description of changes, see the [forum discussion](https://gov.gearbox.fi/t/gip-53-gearbox-v2-security-improvements/2431).\n\n## Contract changes\n\nThe contracts to be replaced:\n- CreditConfigurator for each underlying asset’s CM;\n- CreditFacade for each underlying asset’s CM;\n- All adapters;\n- All LP price feeds;\n- A new BlacklistHelper contract will be added to the USDC credit contract suite;\n\nThe new versions of the contracts can be found in:\n\n* Core contracts in the ['main'](https://github.com/Gearbox-protocol/core-v2) branch of 'core-v2' starting from commit [710113f](https://github.com/Gearbox-protocol/core-v2/commit/710113fa4383bb43b144118ff1d7828027aa5acf);\n* Adapters in the ['legacy'](https://github.com/Gearbox-protocol/integrations-v3/tree/legacy) branch of 'integrations-v3' starting from commit [e34cfbe](https://github.com/Gearbox-protocol/integrations-v3/commit/e34cfbe9fb7e3b41121acce1911c4484ca60e211);\n\n## Parameter additions and changes\n\nNew security parameters will be established:\n1) Maximal cumulative loss before pausing a CM - equal to maxBorrowedAmount for each respective CM: \n1.1) DAI - 1'000'000;\n1.2) USDC - 1'000'000;\n1.3) WETH - 600;\n1.4) wstETH - 600;\n1.5) WBTC - 50;\n1.6) FRAX - 1'000'000;\n\n2) Emergency liquidation premium - 4% for all CMs;\n\n3) Total debt limit - corresponding pool's expected liquidity at the time of deployment;\n\nAdditionally, two dev team bot addresses will be added into the emergency liquidator list:\n\n1. 0x16040e932b5Ac7A3aB23b88a2f230B4185727b0d\n2. 0x3c2E5548bCe88315D50eAB4f6b1Ffb2f1B8eBd7A\n\n## Changes for end users\n\nFor UI users:\n\n* WalletConnect support would be discontinued and the corresponding tab removed. Practically, it was always buggy and never got properly fixed, so nobody is factually being affected by this.\n\nFor smart contract users and integrators:\n\n* All account management would be done through `CreditFacade.multicall()` - this includes both adapters and CreditFacade functions for managing existing accounts, such as `increaseDebt`. Account opening/closing is unaffected.\n* Most view functions were removed from adapters (unless the function does not exist in the contract the adapter points to). The target contract needs to be called instead of the adapter;\n\n## Timeline\n\nThe dev team is essentially ready to deploy, so the changes should be live within 1-2 days after the proposal is successfully voted on.\n",

      "title": "[GIP-52] Continue Business Development Initiative",
      "content": "BD Q1 Recap/Q2 Proposal\n\nSummary\n\nThis is a follow-up proposal to continue funding the BD initiative at Gearbox through engagement with Hedglin Consulting LLC and Jared Hedglin. This proposal would grant another three month initiative to continue growing Gearbox.\n\nQuarterly Review\n\nThe primary objective of this first engagement period (Feb 1, ‘23 - Apr 31, ‘23) was to increase TVL. Before and during the engagement, myself and other Gearbox contributors discussed V2 with some funds and advisors, and we received feedback that the rates were not competitive enough to justify large deposits when the “risk free rate” was so close to what Gearbox yields offered.\n\nInstitutional and TVL Engagement\n\nWith this feedback in hand, I proceeded to pitch the Special LP Boost 1 discussion to 12 new (not previously engaged) venture funds, hedge funds, and family offices, however, only two institutional firms indicated interest in the opportunity. The main pushback around engagement was size required to participate, specifically in a macro environment where return of capital has been dominant over return on capital. As Gearbox has continued to show its safety and security, the “institutional comfort” has seemingly grown reputationally, but we have seen TVL decrease since the beginning of the period. I would attribute this trend to several factors including the uncertain global regulatory environment, the USDC depeg incident, and tangentially Nexus’ V2 launch, which has caused insurance rates to go up, making depositing into Gearbox less appealing. Despite TVL now hovering near $90m, the protocol’s resilience has been clear and that narrative is resonating with larger players in the space.\n\nOne highlight of the quarter was the Balancer Boosted Pools launching to deposit funds into Gearbox. I originally engaged with Balancer contributors in July 2022 to start discussing this integration. Fortunately, the Balancer team saw the opportunity and Gearbox’s traction, and so they built out the entire boosted pool system, which is now currently being used to deposit ~$5m into Gearbox pools. Although $5m is just a start, this situation demonstrates the time required to evolve conversations into working relationships and a realized product showing results.\n\nEvents\n\nIn addition to focusing specifically on raising TVL, I’ve leveraged additional events to grow the network and get in front of users that haven’t encountered Gearbox. I’ve added a bullet point summary below of the events that I’ve covered over the past three months;\n\nETH Denver\n\nGearbox/Liquity/Euler Sponsored Event at Happy Camper Pizza\n~250 attendees\nReceived feedback that it was the “best side event at ETH Denver” from multiple attendees\nTeams from Variant, DefiLlama, Balancer, Aura, Alchemix, Chainlink, Redstone, and more came to discuss the space.\nSpecial shoutout to the VIBES Subcommittee for funding Gearbox’s share of this co-hosted event and (also designing) the T-shirts that were printed.\nMet with RIA’s, Asset Managers, Liquid Funds, and protocols/infrastructure teams at ETH Denver.\nAttended four other VC networking events and networked at the conference\nNFT NTC side events\n\nDid not pay for a ticket to NFT.NYC\nMet with some blue-chip NFT communities and discussed how they use defi (especially borrowing against their own NFT’s or lending them out for APY), and educated them on how to use Gearbox\nConsensus Austin\n\nNext week, I’ve scheduled meetings with four wallet companies to continue the push to get Gearbox deposits represented in wallet native UI’s, three funds to discuss LP’ing, and two protocols to discuss potential collaboration\nAdditional Activity\n\nWith the intention of starting to build out a more robust pipeline, I worked with Ilgiz to set up an AirTable CRM to start tracking conversations, as well as an inbound interest form that will live on multiple Gearbox sites so that potential users and collaborators can reach out directly to the business development email (bd@gearbox.foundation) in case they do not feel comfortable jumping into a discord.\n\nI’ve also generated a new KOL revenue sharing link with a former sales colleague that operates out of the Asia/Pacific region, and I’ve started working with them on identifying new potential funds to meet regarding Gearbox. Finally, I’ve met with at least 12 external projects that have reached out to diligence if we can work together. This activity was discussed in the original forum post to see if it would fall under my “jurisdiction”, and although I’m not spending extra time looking forthese projects, I do feel that my knowledge of our system lends itself well to qualifying if an inbound lead would be worth pursuing and introducing across the DAO to members with specific areas of expertise.\n\nAreas to improve and next steps\n\nIncreasing new TVL leads\n\nGoing to Consensus will be another step to meeting new firms and finding new opportunities.\nLeaning in to EMEA and APAC opportunities, as those regions seem to be embracing DeFi more\nStill entertaining buying access to a “funds list”, but working with the network to see the best route for this\nWorking with VIBES subdao to send messages directly to whale wallets\nGearing up for V3\n\nEducating previously engaged funds around the new V3 improvements will continue to be vitalAs V3 launches (hopefully in this engagement window) then the “Make Your Own Leverage” pools will be vital in attracting larger LP’s that are more particular about the risk that they are exposed to.\nV3 will allow additional limits to be placed within the protocol, thus allowing launches to other chains. Being a point of contact, as well as starting to engage with these other platforms will be an important piece of my job, even if it is not my primary objective. Finding new teams to build on Gearbox, and exploring potential avenues to bootstrap liquidity across networks with partners.\nEvents\n\nFollow ups from Consensus Austin\nETHGlobal Lisbon- Aiming to go to if approved\nPotentially one other conference to go to this quarter or potentially a trip to Europe to meet with funds\nBudget/Breakdown\n\nI propose the same terms as the previous engagement below. For those interested, I’ve spent $3,500 of my expense budget so far, still with some Consensus expenses coming up. I’ve done my best to get free tickets to both ETH Denver and a developer ticket to Consensus, and if I had to pay full price, then I’d be over budget, but I feel comfortable covering expenses with a $5k budget for the quarter.\n\n$50k USDC for the 3 month grant period. ($45k salary + $5k in expenses + unlocking tokens) The DAO does not currently use any streaming payments mechanism, so I propose delivering this in a one-time payment.\n3 million (3,000,000) $GEAR to be locked for 3 months and then linearly vested over 9 months",

      "title": "[GIP-51] Allocate GEAR to Balancer/Aura g-USD pool bribes",
      "content": "# Proposal:\nAllocate 1m GEAR ($14k at current prices) per 2-week epoch to bribe vlAura holders (via HiddenHand) to vote for the [Balancer Boosted Gearbox USD Pool](https://app.balancer.fi/#/ethereum/pool/0x99c88ad7dc566616548adde8ed3effa730eb6c3400000000000000000000049a) for the purpose of evaluating efficiency relative to directly rewarding GEAR to lenders on Gearbox, and to simultaneously raise awareness for Gearbox and the lending pools to the Aura and Balancer communities.\n\nIf desired by multisig, multisig to coordinate with Aura on sending multiple installments to reduce burden (ie, send 1 month of GEAR and Aura will custody the GEAR and bribe the appropriate amount each epoch). Alternatively, the multisig can conduct bi-weekly operations directly via HiddenHand.\n\n# Justifcation (Less Technical)\nBalancer's boosted pool system allows a portion of a liquidity pool to be deployed in yield bearing strategies, without sacrificing depth of the liquidity pool. This allows LPers to earn additional yield on their position while still allowing large swaps through the pool. An initial pool has been created for USDC, DAI, dUSDC, and dDAI. This means traders can swap USDC and DAI in the pool, while LPers earn yield from lending USDC and DAI to Gearbox on a portion of their liquidity position.\n\nThe pool earns yield in the form of swap fees, base yield (USDC, DAI), external rewards (GEAR), and internal rewards (AURA, BAL). A portion of the yield is passed on to the LPer, a portion goes to the DAO treasury/veBAL, and another portion is used to bribe voters to vote for the pool (essentially this means LPers get a little extra yield, but in the form of AURA/BAL instead of GEAR).\n\nAn initial group of vlAura holders voted for the Gearbox USD pool. This created initial rewards in BAL/AURA, which brought TVL, which brings APR that goes to LPers/bribes, etc. There is a potential flywheel here, where an 'altruistic' baseline of voters will create baseline incentives, which brings TVL, which brings APR, which brings more TVL, etc, etc. A key piece of this flywheel is the [Aura bribe multiplier](https://app.aura.finance/#/lock) which is historically between 1 and 1.5 ($1 paid to aura voters will send between $1.5 and $2 of emissions to the pool). \n\nHowever, the initial vote has ended - so a new altruistic voter would need to step in to continue to grow the pool. Or, perhaps a voter that is already spending GEAR for diesel pools - aka, Gearbox.\n\nThe primary question here is: **If we spend GEAR to bribe vlAura voters to vote for this pool, do we actually get more dUSDC and dDAI liquidity than if we send GEAR to the lenders directly?**. The answer is: **MAYBE**. Essentially there are a LOT of assumptions and variables, but in general most conditions lead to it being somewhere between slightly worse and a bit better (see below section for more information). \n\nSo - the goal of this proposal is to fill in the void in voting, in order to see if the pool grows as we expect it to over time. The purpose would be to re-evaluate in the future to determine if a more significant portion of lending pool liquidity mining would make sense to divert to this pool. Additionally, the presence of a stablecoin pool with reasonable yield can bring new eyes to Gearbox and the lending pools from the Aura/Bal communities (which should encapsulate a decent chunk of active DeFi yield farmers/lenders).\n\n# More Technical Context\nA boosted pool begins with a [linear pool](https://docs.balancer.fi/concepts/pools/linear.html). This is a pool that pairs a yield bearing asset with it’s underlying collateral. For example, yvWETH and WETH. The pool has a target weighting that can be compared to the actual pool balance onchain with expected price functions of the yield bearing asset. When a pool user helps restore the pool balance closer to the target, they receive a credit. When they push it further off balance, they pay a fee. The bigger a pool, the higher % of yield bearing asset it can hold as the target balance is a flat number (not a percentage).\n\nThe linear pool token can then be paired with another asset to create a boosted pool. For example, a yvWETH/WETH linear pool could be paired with GEAR to create a GEAR/(yvWETH/WETH) market where a specified percentage of WETH (based on the linear pool balance) is deployed in Yearn. \n\nWe would be looking at creating and utilizing base pairings with Gearbox's diesel lending pools (dWETH, dUSDC, etc). This [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1523wM98_Nc394anBtVQ-PIxe67V0-4Vm8zPGhf6gLes/edit?usp=sharing) has been created to model two potential use cases:\n1. Comparing sending GEAR rewards to the gearbox DAI and USDC lending pools with instead bribing the Gearbox boosted pool\n2. Comparing liquidity mining GEAR/WETH on Curve v2 with a potential GEAR/(wETH/dWETH) pool on balancer \n\nThe spreadsheet takes inputs from the current GEARBOX pools and compares them to bribing vlAura voters. There are a few highly impactful variables here such as the vote multiplier, the assumed APR that LPers will demand (because the protocol does not set the APR - the LPers decide that, the protocol just dictates total rewards), and pool size. The purpose is to determine which approach represents a net savings in spendings on both liquidity mining programs. These variables are highly.. .well... variable... and therefore it is difficult to draw a meaningful conclusion. The spreadsheet also details and incorporates the exact breakdown of fee share in boosted pools.\n\nNote the GEAR/WETH comparison does not yet include the option to bribe the curve pool. However, because the altruistic anon votes for the curve pool seem to have dried up, this scenario should also be considered if considering changes to GEAR/WETH liquidity mining.\n\n\n### A note on bribes\nIt would be fair to ask “this bribe multiplier thing seems too good to be true, who tf loses in this case?”. Ultimately I think bribes/liquidity mining/etc are all a manifestation of P/E ratios. You can give $1 of profit to an LPer every year, or you can give that same LPer a token that entitles them to $1 of profit this year, and a bit less every year after that assuming the protocol doesn’t grow and they keep getting diluted by giving out new tokens. In the investing world, most investments are valued at some Price/Earnings ratio greater than 1. That means the token promising ~$1/year is almost always valued by the market as worth more than $1. As long as that is true, it will always be better to distribute tokens instead of direct revenue to incentivize protocol use. Granted, the game is different in DeFi as many tokens do not distribute revenue and instead only offer governance - but despite that, many tokens still trade at a P/E ratio far greater than 1 (if not a negative number because earnings are negative). TL;DR as long as the investing world is pricing in growth, bribes gud for bootstrapping/sourcing liquidity where imbalanced.\n\n\n# Reference\nFor reference: current GEAR/WETH LM program = $50k/month or $25k/ 2 weeks\nhttps://gov.gearbox.fi/t/gip-49-extend-gear-weth-liquidity-mining/2391\n\nCurrent GEAR Supply Lend Program: 275m tokens over 1 year = 23m/month or $343k/month, $170k/ 2 weeks\nhttps://gov.gearbox.fi/t/gip-30-lm-adjustment-1/1875\n\n# Voting\nVoting is simple FOR, AGAINST, ABSTAIN.",

      "title": "[GIP-50] subDAO VIBES budget Q2 and onboarding Rising Vista (ivangbi) on OBRA",
      "content": "## Summary\nVIBES subDAO wants to ask Gearbox DAO treasury for 3,000,000 GEAR tokens and 25,000 USDC to continue marketing activities in Q2 2023. Also continue the work of VIBES subDAO in the development of PR, marketing and community.\nAdd monthly payment for Rising Vista (ivangbi) 7,000 USDC based on OBRA. \n\n## Motivation\n\nUnder GIP-13 VIBES subDAO was created July 20, 2022 with an initial budget of 50,000 USDC and 10,000,000 GEAR; this budget was allocated for Q3 2022, but has not been fully utilized to this day.\n\nYou can see all the payments that were made by VIBES subDAO: \n[Link - VIBES subDAO Payroll](https://www.notion.so/gearboxprotocol/78ec041d882d43c59c06e1608f933c30?v=09461061b8d748b39e47da2f1e44cf5c)\n\nIt is worth noting that with the beginning of 2023 there are more payments and most likely soon the budget will be exhausted (VIBES Q1 2023 payments and a large merchandise order are coming soon). In accordance with the model OBRA adopted DAO, we start the new Q2 2023 and want to get additional budget in advance to implement our marketing plans. This budget will probably also be used in Q3 2023 if not utilized in Q2. So we are not focusing on wasting the budget, but just replenishing our coffers to have the liquidity to accomplish our goals.\n\n### Key Results and goals\n\n\n-   Higher twitter following. Previous cycle saw following 3x from 17k to 51k.\n-   Higher twitter engagement, previous cycle saw a 72% increment over the May-June period and currently stands close to ATH.\n- Increasing PR department capabilities. Increase in KOLs, increase in Media outlets, increase in publications. \n-   Higher Discord retention and more active chats. \n-   Increase brand and V3 awareness, current V3 campaign and posts across KOLs and Gearbox have already crossed half a million views. Goal will be to deliver 2.5M views for Redefine.\n-   Increase community base- Adding Сassava for specific Africa based expansion.\n-   To increase general awareness and competence regarding use post community expansion. By creating a learning funnel from airdrop hunter → active community member → user → advanced user. Will help Gearbox and DeFi both grow.\n-   Get more feedback about the product and its advantages/disadvantages through regular surveys of active users.\n\nIf you analyze the past experience, it seems that VIBES coped very well with the tasks that were set for themselves. For this we want to continue to develop the community, as well as to develop the KOLs direction, the referral program and the rest of the marketing and PR activities. \n\n### Budget for VIBES Q3\n\nThe suggested amount is 3,000,000 GEAR which corresponds to $45,000 worth at the GEAR price of 150M FDV [GEAR = $0.015]. This amount should be enough for Q2 2023. Additional replenishment of the budget may be required or, conversely, it will be transferred to Q3 2023. For the USDC side, it now has a use as an additional expense item for KOLs has been added. For now, we would like to request $25,000 for those who are strongly opposed to receiving GEAR as compensation. Although we always prefer the latter.\n\nAll payments and processes will be reported to the community in a report.\n\n## Add monthly payment for Rising Vista (ivangbi) 7,000 USDC based on OBRA. \n\n\nYou can read Ivangbi proposal here: [Link](https://gov.gearbox.fi/t/gip-43-obra-dao-governance-framework-cycle-1-feb-april/2303/23)\nIf the offer is accepted, Ivangbi will be able to receive 7,000 USDC per month from DAO if 1x is filled in. Ivangbi will not receive additional GEAR as an incentive.\n\nHe continues to advise DAO and in particular VIBES subDAO on marketing and other inherent things anyway. (Anyway) But he's human, too, and he wants to eat. Also it is necessary to consider his attitude to the project, he has no liquid funds from Gearbox Protocol because he hasn’t sold any GEAR received from the early contributions.\n",

      "content": "# Proposal\n\nReduce the current GEAR/WETH liquidity mining program from 6.66m GEAR/month to 3.33m GEAR/month. Utilize the remaining GEAR from the currently approved liquidity mining program until gone, then utilize GEAR from the treasury to extend the program indefinitely (until modified or dictated otherwise by a future proposal).\n\n# Context\n\nCurrently there is 6.8m GEAR left in the [gauge distributor](https://etherscan.io/address/0x10fb341b5601033d50423b4da336db719fcb1272) rewards contract. Each week approximately 1.67m GEAR is sent to the GEAR/WETH Curve pool from the contract, or approximately 6.66m GEAR/month, meaning the current liquidity mining program would last until mid April. The current spend is about 0.8% of supply per year. This proposal would reduce the spend on GEAR/WETH liquidity to 0.4% of supply per year.\n\n[[GIP-36]](https://snapshot.org/#/gearbox.eth/proposal/0x620877d4693a2435d74d285f0121cb570dab29dcbc9097db5614ab9261f41a8f) Incentivizing GEAR/ETH liquidity originally began at the end of 2022 and would expire in the end of April, 2023. It approved 3.33m GEAR/month to be used to liquidity mine the GEAR/WETH Curve pool for 4 months. [Cider’d rewards](https://snapshot.org/#/gearbox.eth/proposal/0x066005ea8a809a5bbe3212b2d68262a41b787015c2c03d41fdb8c83ccff7c151) also began at that time, with half going to Cider’d participants and [the remainder ](https://snapshot.org/#/gearbox.eth/proposal/0xc906253e8ac1ff5910ab7d5c05bb34c66875ab22313b639f9ca7c94f93a543d7)being added to the same liquidity mining pool to be distributed over 4 months, resulting in 6.67m GEAR/month of liquidity mining.\n\nThe current Curve GEAR/WETH pool holds $4.6m of liquidity (at time of writing) with fluctuating convex staking APR around 60%-80%, with 30% APR coming from liquidity mining and the rest coming from miscellaneous veCRV voters. This is on a slight downtrend ([2 weeks ago](https://gov.gearbox.fi/t/gip-39-2-liquidity-and-liquidity-mining-update/2225/33?u=ov3rkoalafied) it was 100%).\n\nThere are a few factors that could increase liquidity in the future:\n\n1. An increase in GEAR/WETH price would increase the effective APR, thus attracting more liquidity\n2. Tokens tend to become less volatile after launch, thus reducing the APR required to subsidize impermanent loss (also LPers can be lazy and happy to remain and collect even at a lower APR given lack of better percieved opportunities).\n\nThere are a few factors that could decrease liquidity in the future:\n\n1. This proposal! It would reduce effective APR from 60-80% down to 45-65%,\n2. As a result of this proposal, or in general, veCRV voters could stop voting for GEAR/WETH.\n3. A decrease in the GEAR/WETH price would decrease the effective APR, thus potentially causing some liquidity to leave.\n\nFor reference, if all veCRV voters left and this proposal were also enacted, and APR was kept constant, the pool size would reduce to ~$1m. However, GEAR has also had listings on centralized exchanges - currently the Curve pool makes up only 20% of the volume of GEAR trading, with CEX’s making up almost the entirety of the rest of the volume.\n\nTherefore, with with a theoretical worst-case scenario still being a minimally viable pool size, at about 5-10% of circulating supply. Note that much of this proposal is subjective - the main point being justifying a 50% decrease in liquidity mining rewards, rather than trying to determine the ideal minimum amount of rewards (which is also subjective, and would likely require analysis of what is typically done with GEAR rewards from the diesel lending pools).\n\n# Voting\n\n1. FOR - modify GEAR/WETH liquidity mining program to 3.33m GEAR/month indefinitely\n2. AGAINST - do not change liquidity mining program (set to expire mid-April)",

      "title": "[GIP-46] Initial Assignments and Tasks for the Gearbox Foundation",
      "content": "## Motivation\n\nDear all, as you know, the Gearbox Foundation (the “Foundation”) was established (you can learn more in this thread [link](https://gov.gearbox.fi/t/notice-incorporation-of-gearbox-foundation-no-action-required/2324)).\n\nIn order for the Foundation to operate in the best possible way, the DAO has to decide on the major short-term and long-term assignments that will be given to the Foundation, allocation of resources, as well as other matters related to its operations.\n\nTo accomplish this, we urge the community to engage in discussions and draft a GIP to be passed as a DAO resolution. The major items that we suggest to address are:\n\na) Assignments, for example, IP management, source code licensing, manage and maintain subscriptions with third-party services such as hostings, email providers, etc.;\n\nb) Allocation of a budget in USDC/T that can cover the operational expenses of the Foundation during a particular term, for example, 12 months;\n\nc) Appointment of representatives, committees, or sub-DAOs who can exercise the DAO’s rights and act as its representatives in discussions with the Foundation regarding specific subjects (so that there’s no need for the DAO to pass separate resolutions on such subjects as its representatives can provide respective instructions).\n\nTo help in this process, we have prepared a draft GEAR DAO Resolution, which can serve as a basis or sample for a DAO resolution to be adopted. \n\n## GEAR DAO RESOLUTION\n\nBy this action, the GEAR DAO (the “**DAO**”) hereby adopts the following resolutions and takes the following actions with regard to the Gearbox Foundation (the “**Foundation**”):\n\n 1.  Long-Term Assignments.

      "title": "[GIP-44] Business Development Initiative",
      "content": "Summary\n\nThis is a proposal to start the Gearbox Business Development (GBBD) Initiative, which will lead efforts in attracting large users to the protocol. Due to budgeting and planning constraints, it will likely consist of a single member to start. I, Jared Hedglin, working through Hedglin Consulting, would like to propose myself for the role spanning an initial three month engagement.\n\nMotivation\n\nGearbox has the potential to become a leading DeFi protocol financially empowering an entire new class of investors who may not have access to similar financial services due to geography or economic status. However, to establish the project as the dominant composable leverage protocol - a potentially enormous category - deeper liquidity on the protocol’s supply-side is necessary. As evidenced by high utilization, there is clear PMF expressed from the borrowing side of Gearbox; however, more effort is required for growing the total amount of liquidity provided to Gearbox.\n\nLike many leading DeFi projects, Gearbox will need qualified contributors to actively build relationships with liquidity providers, borrowers, protocols, wallet platforms, service providers and more in order to attract liquidity and users to the ecosystem. While Gearbox’s current $100m TVL is extremely impressive for an early-stage project, the protocol’s competitive yields could easily support a large influx of liquidity.\n\nImportantly, many whales, DeFi funds, power users, and institutions require some level of human interfacing with the DAO in order to to gain comfort with LPing. Therefore, it is my belief that a coordinated BD program, spearheaded by a specialized subDAO, would deliver outlier value to the Gearbox protocol.\n\nSpecification\n\nThe GBBD Initiative would serve two high level goals: increasing Gearbox’s adoption and visibility among potential liquidity providers and DeFi power users. The funding for this subDAO will be used to unlock on-chain research to find whales, setting up calls with institutions to educate them on Gearbox, speaking to broad audiences on Twitter spaces and podcasts, as well as representing Gearbox at key industry events.\n\nThis section breaks those overarching goals down into specific tasks.\n\nGoal #1: Increase Gearbox’s Adoption\n\nDevelop a robust go-to-market strategy for a pipeline of LP’s and borrowers with DeFi power users, protocols, funds, companies, and institutional investors. Create and document processes like a CRM, feedback loop, continuity plan for growing this role and subdao\nIntegrate best-in-class technologies, such as a CRM, to track and manage subDAO relationships.\n\n\nGoal #2: Increase Gearbox’s Visibility\n\nBuild relationships and partnerships to bring Gearbox to other user interfaces and applications (especially in a potential partnership/referral program)\nEstablish a professional digital and physical presence for Gearbox at key industry events.\nDuration\n\nThis proposal recommends a three month engagement, which can be extended by the DAO at the end of the term. Subsequent proposals will likely include additional 3-month extensions. This approach allows for the setting of high level KPIs to be set with sufficient time to achieve them, but also allows the DAO to periodically monitor and provide feedback on progress with regards to the overarching goals defined above.\n\nProposed Budget\n\nI was previously working for Boxcode and Gearbox Protocol Limited, the companies that raised the seed round. My compensation and expenses were the following:\n\nTotal salary: $280K/year (included insurance expenses, travel, conference, and business expenses)\nToken vesting: 5 million $GEAR to be locked for 3 months and then linearly vested over 9 months (as per the current contributor vesting schedules)\nI would like to propose a “quarterly salary plus expenses” of 45k USDC, which is equivalent to a $180k per year salary. This represents a 36% pay cut, while still maintaining the additional legal/insurance/conference expenses.\n\nWith this budget, I will be able to put forth my full time and efforts for serving the goals of this subDAO and supporting the Gearbox protocol.\n\nCompensation Benchmarking\n\nAccording to data from Pave 1, the median salary for a VP of Business Development is around $185k and a total annual cash compensation of $200k. I will be taking on more responsibilities than just a VP of BD, but added this comparison for context.\nIt’s worth noting that these numbers do not include benefits such as health insurance, which I will have to pay for out of pocket. Additionally, there is no bonus associated with this position, so the total cash compensation is equal to the base salary. In comparison to the market, this proposed salary is competitive but slightly below average for the DAO. These numbers also do not consider any additional liability or risks.\nBreakdown\n\n$50k USDC for the 3 month grant period. ($45k salary + $5k in expenses + unlocking tokens) The DAO does not currently use any streaming payments mechanism, so I propose delivering this in a one-time payment.\n3 million (3,000,000) $GEAR to be locked for 3 months and then linearly vested over 9 months, in line with the same vesting schedule for other contributors. At today’s fair market value, this approximately $45k, but represents both future upside as well as uncertainty in risk in both the market and future regulations. If I were to stay for a full year, then 12m GEAR tokens would represent 0.12% of the token float, which is a comparable number often offered to early contributors that take the risk of leaving “comfortable and stable” positions.\nI will cover expenses out of this distribution to attend additional conferences :\nETH Denver (definitely, already booked)\n2-3 other conferences which will be selected shortly based on the quality of attendees.\nTeam\n\nI, Jared Hedglin, would lead the GBBD SubDAO.\n\nI am excited to announce my candidacy for leading the GBBD SubDAO. As a dedicated contributor to Gearbox since March, I am eager to continue my efforts in growing the protocol. With my strong background in institutional crypto, boasting 4+ years of experience, I have played a key role in high-impact projects such as DAO fundraising round pitches, strategy development for V2 launch, and promoting crypto conferences and meetups. I have also been featured on 2 podcasts and 4+ Twitter spaces, and have been available to help with Ninja Mode whitelists. Furthermore, I have successfully led efforts to get Gearbox covered by top industry publications such as Nexus, Token Terminal, Exponential, Cer Live, and others, while working to expand our presence in more DeFi front ends.\n\nI believe I’m the right candidate to lead this effort for Gearbox as I have more than 4 years of experience bringing crypto products to market for leading companies. Prior to Gearbox, I was an Executive Director at BitGo, where I was responsible for selling wallet and custody infrastructure and led the charge to integrate BitGo’s wallets with Metamask. Prior to BitGo, I worked on the Institutional Sales and Trading Desk at Coinbase. Prior to Coinabse, I sold the market leading white-label exchange technology at Alpha Point and led the international Account Management team.\n\nAlthough I may not be degen enough to mint a DegenScore Beacon, I feel that it’s important that I can even reference that in a proposal. The community, including degens, chads, and whales have been incredibly supportive and impressive getting the protocol to its current TVL in a deep bear market and in a year with multiple black swans, however, in order to get to a top 10 protocol, then there needs to be someone (and eventually a team) actively working to grow these metrics.\n\n",

      "content": "## Abstract \n\nThis is proposal to add Abracadabra's MIM (MIM) token as well as Curve MIM3CRV and Convex MIM3CRV as available strategies for all the current (and soon upcoming FRAX) passive pools. \n\n## Motivation\n\nWith USDC and DAI comprising most of Gearbox Protocol passive pool side, there are only a number of strategies currently available to deploy the assets into: [mostly](https://gearbox.riskdao.org/#select-pool) fluctuating between GUSD, sUSD, and LUSD farming. See for yourself in [these pre-made multicalls](https://app.gearbox.fi/accounts/strategies/list) that save leverage users time. As the APY on those naturally fluctuates due to how Curve pool gauges get distributed, it's interesting to increase the product offering so Ninjas have a wider range to choose from. On that note, MIM strategies have long offered attractive APYs while sticking to their $1 peg consistently enough.\n\n \n![1cfc65f054b6a2ef1fc152a6d371dc390cdb94e9.png](ipfs://bafkreif32dx5sk5qvo7upj4zd7id7gfgfom5ryg7afdvm6hshbmlffqebq)\n    \nhttps://dune.com/apeir99n/gearbox-protocol-dashboard\n\nWhile utilization of passive pools has been through the peak, this doesn't per se offer more TVL growth opportunities - but instead, possibly diversifies the protocol collaterals: https://gearbox.riskdao.org/#select-pool. On collaterals, see this docs section: https://docs.gearbox.finance/traders-and-farmers/pro-leverage-bible#a-different-concept-of-collateral. \n\n\n\n## Specification\n\nThe proposed parameters are: \n- add MIM (0x99d8a9c45b2eca8864373a26d1459e3dff1e17f3) as allowed token to FRAX, DAI, USDC, WETH, WBTC and stETH pool's Credit Managers. \n- add Curve MIM3CRV pool contract (0x5a6a4d54456819380173272a5e8e9b9904bdf41b) as an allowed contract.\n- add Curve MIM3CRV pool token (0x5a6a4d54456819380173272a5e8e9b9904bdf41b) as an allowed token to FRAX, DAI, USDC, WETH, WBTC and stETH pool's Credit Managers\n- add Convex pool contract (0xFd5AbF66b003881b88567EB9Ed9c651F14Dc4771) as an allowed contract. \n- add Convex cvxMIM3CRV pool token (0xabb54222c2b77158cc975a2b715a3d703c256f05) as an allowed token to FRAX, DAI, USDC, WETH, WBTC and stETH pool's Credit Managers\n- set Liquidation Threshold as: \n\n|Token|USDC pool (%)|DAI pool (%)|WETH pool (%)|wstETH pool (%)|WBTC pool (%)| FRAX pool (%)|\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|MIM|80|80|80|80|80|80\n|MIM3CRV|85|85|80|80|80|85\n|cvxMIM3CRV|85|85|80|80|80|85\n|stkcvxMIM3CRV|85|85|80|80|80|85\n\n## Price Feed\n\nSet price feed as ChainLink's oracle for MIM and Gearbox's Curve and Convex pricing contracts for MIM3CRV and cvxMIM3CRV/stkcvxMIM3CRV. See how other Curve pool oracles work [here](https://medium.com/gearbox-protocol/product-evolution-v2-gearbox-protocol-from-1-to-2-going-further-dcedf3b5d959).\n\n## Risks and Explanation\n\n#### MIM previous collaterals and bad debt\nSince the time of UST and FTT, which had a large share among MIM collateral assets, their current composition looks much much better: [MIM Dashboard](https://bad-debt.riskdao.org/markets?platform=MIM). With that being said, the protocol could be argued to still have potentially about 5.5% bad debt. Therefore, the max LTV for LP tokens is set up at 85, leaving a good gap for liquidations.\n\n#### 85 LTV max leverage and why 80 on others\n\nThe LP tokens in Curve and Convex have much less volatility compared to a regular MIM as an asset. Moreover, that will likely be the final destination for gearbox leverage users. As such, having higher LTVs for LP tokens while lower LTV allows for great leverage farming yet not over-exposing to risks.\n\nThis would allow for 5x+ farming with yet a safe-enough Health Factor. Anyway, the risks are up to every user individually. See more in [how to calculate that in the docs](https://docs.gearbox.finance/traders-and-farmers/pro-leverage-bible#how-to-max-out...-but-kinda-safely).\n\n## References\n1. https://abracadabra.money/\n2.

      "title": "[GIP-46] Add cbETH to Allowed List",
      "content": "## Abstract \n\nThis is proposal to add Coinbase ETH (cbETH) as an AllowedList asset for Credit Account users, for all the current (and soon upcoming FRAX) passive pools. \n\n## Motivation\n\nIn a couple of months’ time, we will have the ETH Shanghai upgrade which will allow ETH stakers to finally withdraw the ETH they have been locking up since 2020. The amount of ETH to be unlocked is about 16% of the overall supply and a vast majority of these ETH are likely to be deployed back through LSDs (like LIDO, cbETH, rocket pool etc). Moreover, it's possible to expect even more ETH to be staked as the risk of liquidity will gradually start perishing with Shanghai settling down in scared minds.\n\nAn **LSD or liquid staking derivative** is where a staker is able to stake their ETH and in turn receive a “receipt” token like stETH - which then effectively offers to liquidity to their staked position. And with this, they also accumulate the yield generated on staking, which is where Gearbox comes in. Given LSDs are one of the most sustainable sources of yield, the ability to lever them up produces a great opportunity for sustainable high yields potentially over 15% at manageable risk. Further, given the size of the unlock, this also presents to us a chance to grow our own TVL. Thus this proposal aims at adding cbETH based LSD strategies to the Gearbox LLSD cohort alongside the existing stETH strategies.\n\nCoinbase Wrapped Staked ETH (“cbETH”) is a utility token that represents Ethereum 2 (ETH2), which is ETH staked through Coinbase. Coinbase customers can wrap their locked staked ETH to receive cbETH, which is an asset that can be traded, moved on-chain, and used in DeFi and other dapps. cbETH is known as a liquid staking token because it allows holders to get the benefits of staking without lockups or unbonding periods.\n\ncbETH is a standard ERC-20 token designed using the cToken model — a model created by Compound Finance to represent depository assets in their protocol. cbETH maintains a conversion rate that represents the amount of underlying ETH2, and Coinbase will wrap or unwrap at this rate without charging fees. \n\nThe liquidity of cbETH on DEXes is much lower than on stETH (~$19M on Uniswap and ~$8M on Curve), however, there is quite deep liquidity on Coinbase. This allows being sure that at the current scale of Gearbox protocol, the liquidators will not face a lack of liquidity. However, it is proposed to put the LT a little less than that of stETH. \n\n## Specification\n\nThe proposed parameters are: \n- add cbETH (0xBe9895146f7AF43049ca1c1AE358B0541Ea49704) as allowed token to DAI, USDC, FRAX, WETH, WBTC and stETH pool's Credit Managers. \n- add Curve cbETH/ETH pool contract (0x5fae7e604fc3e24fd43a72867cebac94c65b404a) as an allowed contract.\n- set Liquidation Threshold as: \n\n|Token|USDC pool (%)|DAI pool (%)|WETH pool (%)|wstETH pool (%)|WBTC pool (%)|FRAX pool (%)|\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|cbETH|80|80|85|85|80|80\n\n## Price Feed\nSet price feed as ChainLink's oracle for cbETH. \n\n## References\n\n1. https://www.coinbase.com/price/coinbase-wrapped-staked-eth\n2.

      "title": "[GIP-39] Liquidity and Liquidity Mining Update",
      "content": "# Proposal\n1. Multisig is to seed a new 50/50 GEAR/stETH pool on Balancer with 0.3% fee, using 300 ETH from strategic round 2 funds and matching value in GEAR from the main treasury. \n2. Modify liquidity mining from  [GIP-36](https://gov.gearbox.fi/t/gip-36-gear-weth-liquidity-mining/2143/18) from 4 months to 6 months, keeping the total quantity the same (13.33m GEAR)\n3. Divert 1/3rd of liquidity mining funds from GIP-36 to bribing the Balancer pool through Aura/Hidden Hand. \n3. Switch all remaining liquidity mining (from GIP 36 and Cider'd) to bribe vlCVX voters through votium\n4. DAO will collect all earned BAL and AURA rewards and lock them, voting for GEAR/WETH emissions with its locked positions.\n\n### End result:\n1. Multisig owns 600 ETH worth of Balancer GEAR/stETH liquidity. \n2. 4.44m GEAR over 6 months is used to bribe Balancer GEAR/stETH liquidity pool\n2. 8.88m GEAR over 6 months is used to bribe Curve GEAR/WETH liquidity pool\n3. ~15m GEAR over 4 months is also used to bribe Curve GEAR/WETH liquidity pool (from Cider'd)\n\n# Justification\nCider'd raised more fees than were anticipated, thus resulting in high APR even at high amounts of liquidity. Keeping cider'd rewards over the 4 month period helps continue to absorb volatility for the new GEAR token, while splitting and extending the current GIP-36 program creates an assurance of rewards continuing after Cider'd rewards are used up (subject to anything that overrides this proposal in the future).\n\nMultiple liquidity sources are necessary to make an oracle feasible. Oracles are necessary for many third party integrations in DeFi, which can bring utility to the GEAR token. \n\nCreating liquidity on Balancer will also diversify partnerships, and the Aura and Bal rewards will create a semi-sustainable baseline of liquidity incentivization for the DAO over time. \n\nstETH is used as a pairing as yield bearing assets recieve rebates from trading fees, which are recyled into bribes for veBAL holders. There are risks in pairing with stETH, but these risks are lessened significantly by the fact that the curve liquidity pool will remain as the largest liquidity pool for GEAR.\n\nBribing is used due to efficiency. The bribe multiplier is defined as the amount of emissions sent to LPers per $1 in bribes. For CRV it's ~[$1.87](https://llama.airforce/#/bribes/overview) and for [Aura](https://app.aura.finance/#/lock) it's $3 - both making bribes a no-brainer. \n\nWith the DAO owning initial POL in balancer, it will ensure that excess bribes are not wasted (as they will be returned to the DAO). Additionally, this would allow the DAO to build an Aura position that can be used to create additional rewards for LPers (including the DAO itself). The position would be worth the stake (600 ETH proposed) x the APR (~100% in current Curve v2 pool), and could be used to justify reducing liquidity mining expenses in the future.\n\n# Execution\nPrior to executing this proposal, the following must happen:\n1. A DAO contributor must get a proposal passed for a Curve and Convex gauge for GEAR/WETH (in progress)\n2. A DAO contributor must seed a GEAR/WETH pool on Balancer, [here](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/instructions-overview/2674).\n3. A DAO contributor must get a proposal passed for a BAL and AURA gauge for GEAR/WETH, following the process here: https://forum.balancer.fi/t/instructions-overview/2674\n4. A DAO contributor will need to contact votium to get GEAR enabled as a valid bribe token: https://docs.votium.app/explainers/briber-manual, as well as contact Hidden Hand (Redacted) for the same reason.\n\nAdditionally, DAO contributors should seek to get both GEAR pools adopted into various aggregation services such as Matcha, Paraswap, 1inch, etc. \n\n# Multisig Bribing Instructions\n2. Every 2-week epoch, the multisig simply needs to deposit the required reward amount to votium (for the Curve pool): https://votium.app/ (or for tracking purposes, could do the Cider'd and normal LM bribes separately)\n3. Every 2-week epoch, the multisig simply needs to deposit the required reward amount to Hidden Hand (for the Balancer pool): https://hiddenhand.finance/aura?slug=aura\n\nNote hidden hand and votium are utilized due to simplicity. Other bribe options exist, including Paladin and StakeDAO solutions to bribing veCRV holders. A future proposal could suggest switching Votium bribes to one of these platforms. This proposal could come at any time - it's a trivial task for the multisig to switch sending bribes from Votium to another platform, so the majority of the work is explaining to the DAO how it works and why it is better. \n\n# Voting\nVoting will be simple \"for\" or \"against\" the full plan with an \"abstain\" option.\n\nVoting is ranked choice:\n1. Do All\n2. Do All Except Deposit Treasury Funds\n3. Do Only Curve Bribes (Nothing Balancer Related)\n4. Do Something Else/Keep As Is",

      "title": "[GIP-42] Accounting locked in Curve LP GEARs in DAO Governance",
      "content": "\n## Motivation \n\nThere are currently ~900 million GEAR in circulation. At the same time, ~100 million GEAR are locked in Curve LP (you can see exact amount [here](https://etherscan.io/address/0x0e9b5b092cad6f1c5e6bc7f89ffe1abb5c95f1c2)). Many of those who provide liquidity in Curve have participated in cidered liquidity and are active members of the community. Therefore, it seems fair to give them also the right to participate in the Governance. \n\n\n## Implementation\n\n1. Consider that the LP position of user has a GEAR in the amount \n`GEAR balance on curve * balanceOfLP(holder) / totalLPSupply()` \n, where \n - `GEAR balance on curve` shows how much GEAR are on LP pool contract (0x0e9b5b092cad6f1c5e6bc7f89ffe1abb5c95f1c2)\n- balanceOfLP - user's balance of Curve LP tokens\n- totalLPSupply - total Supply of Curve LP tokens\n\n 2. User's balance of Curve LP tokens (balanceOfLP) is calculated as sum of Curve LP tokens on his wallet, Curve LP tokens staked by him into Curve Gauge and Curve LP tokens staked by him into Convex\n\n## Disclaimer\n\nThis proposal is to allow governance to function and reach quorums, which have always been hard to achieve - but now almost impossible. As such, while governance remains in the snapshot<>multisig model, some decisions value speed over fine print. Therefore, in case snapshot governance gets attacked due to Curve pool manipulation [this proposal done doesn’t allow for dummy manipulations, but it wasn’t fully audited either] - snapshot admins reserve the right to make a post-mortem and make the attacker proposal void. That is per the rules described in the docs (which have remained unchanged since before the DAO inception https://docs.gearbox.finance/governance/setup#practical-point-with-regard-to-the-snapshot). Later on, once governance becomes fully on-chain, any such oversight actions would not be possible or technically feasible. But that’s a question to solve in the next steps. For now, the model improvement suggested should do its job and allow for swift transition.\n\n\n## Conclusion\nI propose to add voting power for Curve LP holders according to the logic described above",

      "title": "[GIP-39] Liquidity and Liquidity Mining Update",
      "content": "# Proposal\n1. Multisig is to seed a new 50/50 GEAR/stETH pool on Balancer with 0.3% fee, using 300 ETH from strategic round 2 funds and matching value in GEAR from the main treasury. \n2. Modify liquidity mining from  [GIP-36](https://gov.gearbox.fi/t/gip-36-gear-weth-liquidity-mining/2143/18) from 4 months to 6 months, keeping the total quantity the same (13.33m GEAR)\n3. Divert 1/3rd of liquidity mining funds from GIP-36 to bribing the Balancer pool through Aura/Hidden Hand. \n3. Switch all remaining liquidity mining (from GIP 36 and Cider'd) to bribe vlCVX voters through votium\n4. DAO will collect all earned BAL and AURA rewards and lock them, voting for GEAR/WETH emissions with its locked positions.\n\n### End result:\n1. Multisig owns 600 ETH worth of Balancer GEAR/stETH liquidity. \n2. 4.44m GEAR over 6 months is used to bribe Balancer GEAR/stETH liquidity pool\n2. 8.88m GEAR over 6 months is used to bribe Curve GEAR/WETH liquidity pool\n3. ~15m GEAR over 4 months is also used to bribe Curve GEAR/WETH liquidity pool (from Cider'd)\n\n# Justification\nCider'd raised more fees than were anticipated, thus resulting in high APR even at high amounts of liquidity. Keeping cider'd rewards over the 4 month period helps continue to absorb volatility for the new GEAR token, while splitting and extending the current GIP-36 program creates an assurance of rewards continuing after Cider'd rewards are used up (subject to anything that overrides this proposal in the future).\n\nMultiple liquidity sources are necessary to make an oracle feasible. Oracles are necessary for many third party integrations in DeFi, which can bring utility to the GEAR token. \n\nCreating liquidity on Balancer will also diversify partnerships, and the Aura and Bal rewards will create a semi-sustainable baseline of liquidity incentivization for the DAO over time. \n\nstETH is used as a pairing as yield bearing assets recieve rebates from trading fees, which are recyled into bribes for veBAL holders. There are risks in pairing with stETH, but these risks are lessened significantly by the fact that the curve liquidity pool will remain as the largest liquidity pool for GEAR.\n\nBribing is used due to efficiency. The bribe multiplier is defined as the amount of emissions sent to LPers per $1 in bribes. For CRV it's ~[$1.87](https://llama.airforce/#/bribes/overview) and for [Aura](https://app.aura.finance/#/lock) it's $3 - both making bribes a no-brainer. \n\nWith the DAO owning initial POL in balancer, it will ensure that excess bribes are not wasted (as they will be returned to the DAO). Additionally, this would allow the DAO to build an Aura position that can be used to create additional rewards for LPers (including the DAO itself). The position would be worth the stake (600 ETH proposed) x the APR (~100% in current Curve v2 pool), and could be used to justify reducing liquidity mining expenses in the future.\n\n# Execution\nPrior to executing this proposal, the following must happen:\n1. A DAO contributor must get a proposal passed for a Curve and Convex gauge for GEAR/WETH (in progress)\n2. A DAO contributor must seed a GEAR/WETH pool on Balancer, [here](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/instructions-overview/2674).\n3. A DAO contributor must get a proposal passed for a BAL and AURA gauge for GEAR/WETH, following the process here: https://forum.balancer.fi/t/instructions-overview/2674\n4. A DAO contributor will need to contact votium to get GEAR enabled as a valid bribe token: https://docs.votium.app/explainers/briber-manual, as well as contact Hidden Hand (Redacted) for the same reason.\n\nAdditionally, DAO contributors should seek to get both GEAR pools adopted into various aggregation services such as Matcha, Paraswap, 1inch, etc. \n\n# Multisig Bribing Instructions\n2. Every 2-week epoch, the multisig simply needs to deposit the required reward amount to votium (for the Curve pool): https://votium.app/ (or for tracking purposes, could do the Cider'd and normal LM bribes separately)\n3. Every 2-week epoch, the multisig simply needs to deposit the required reward amount to Hidden Hand (for the Balancer pool): https://hiddenhand.finance/aura?slug=aura\n\nNote hidden hand and votium are utilized due to simplicity. Other bribe options exist, including Paladin and StakeDAO solutions to bribing veCRV holders. A future proposal could suggest switching Votium bribes to one of these platforms. This proposal could come at any time - it's a trivial task for the multisig to switch sending bribes from Votium to another platform, so the majority of the work is explaining to the DAO how it works and why it is better. \n\n# Voting\nVoting will be simple \"for\" or \"against\" the full plan with an \"abstain\" option.\n\nVoting is ranked choice:\n1. Do All\n2. Do All Except Deposit Treasury Funds\n3. Do Only Curve Bribes (Nothing Balancer Related)\n4. Do Something Else/Keep As Is",

      "title": "[GIP-38]: Updating Uniswap V2/V3 adapters to prevent paths through arbitrary tokens",
      "content": "## Overview\nThis GIP aims to improve the security of the protocol by disallowing arbitrary tokens in Uniswap V2/V3 paths and limiting the maximal path length to 3 hops.\n\n## Problem statement\nCurrently, UniswapV2Adapter and UniswapV3Adapter only check that the input and output tokens in a swap are allowed tokens, without performing any sanity checks on intermediate tokens.\n\nThis leads to an ability to set up an intermediary pool with custom tokens and use it to call untrusted code during a swap. Normally, this does not pose an issue, due to health checks being performed after any swap. However, in certain rare circumstances and with additional techniques there is a potential of bad debt being created.\n\n## Proposed changes\nThe UniswapV2/V3 adapters will be updated to new implementations:\n* [UniswapV2Adapter](https://github.com/Gearbox-protocol/integrations-v2/blob/uniswap-fix/contracts/adapters/uniswap/UniswapV2.sol)\n* [UniswapV3Adapter](https://github.com/Gearbox-protocol/integrations-v2/blob/uniswap-fix/contracts/adapters/uniswap/UniswapV3.sol)\n\nThe new adapters reference a common contract called [UniswapPathChecker](https://github.com/Gearbox-protocol/integrations-v2/blob/uniswap-fix/contracts/adapters/uniswap/UniswapPathChecker.sol) to determine whether a path passed during a swap is valid, which implies:\n\n* The intermediary tokens belong to a fixed list of allowed connector tokens stored in UniswapPathChecker;\n* The path length does not exceed 3 hops (at most 4 tokens are in the passed path array);\n\nThe proposed initial list of allowed connectors is \n**[DAI, USDC, WETH, FRAX]**\nThese settings should allow all Router-generated paths and all practical use-cases in general, while prohibiting custom connectors (or known, but exotic, connectors, which can be used as a substitute to a custom token for the purpose of creating an attacker-controlled Uniswap pool).\n## Additional notes\nThis change is required to enable partial withdrawals in a safe way down the line.\n",

      "title": "[GIP-37] FairTrading Rewards Repurpose",
      "content": "The proposal is aimed at re-calibrating how FairTrading extra fees (which can be large, or could be small) would be utilized. As per GIP-35, it was established to use them during the 4+ months Liquidity Mining program for GEAR/ETH Curve LPs. However, Curve LPs already got GIP-36 with 20%+ APY, which means that FairTrading can be used as a boost instead: both for $GEAR and for $ETH 0xcider participants. This part is part number 3 of the “0xcider BLITZ\" idea which so far seems to controversial to be voted on, so I am simply taking the non-controversial part.\n\n### Proposal\n\nThe proposal is to utilize the FairTrading fees collected over the 6 days period to be:\n\n- 50% used for those who LP within that period, meaning all 0xcider participants\n- 50% used for the 4+ Liquidity Mining program alongside the GIP-36\n\nThe result could be that both $GEAR and $ETH participants will be more likely to ape in, as the possible volatility (and the resulting fees) would become quite big, or maybe not.\n\n#### FAQ\n\n_How will this proposal pass before the end?_\n\nIt doesn’t need to be fully approved for the participants to get an idea. If they see major support for this proposal, they will understand that after 3 days the quorum can be hit. So it’s fine.\n\n_Will enough people be able to vote?_\n\nYes, the strategy on snapshot was upgraded to count 0xcider depositors. That is, whatever address you deposited $GEAR into 0xcider with - has the same 1:1 voting power, no double spending. So all the participants can vote.\n\n_How will the rewards be distributed?_\n\nAs previously planned, for now all the rewards are updated within the main rewards merkle and should be claimable every now and then via https://app.gearbox.fi/gear/rewards main dApp interface.\n\nVoting options:\n\n- 50% LM, 50% to Cider: means 50% for 0xcider and 50% for the 4-months LM\n- 100% to LM, 0% to Cider: means 0% to 0xcider and 100% for the 4-months LM\n- 0% to LM, 100% to Cider: means 100% to 0xcider and 0% for the 4-months LM",

      "content": "### Proposal\n\nCommit 3.33m GEAR/month to liquidity mining the GEAR/ETH Curve V2 pool created by the Cider’d Liquidity Bootstrap, beginning when the fair trade period begins. Liquidity mining program is to last for 4 months, OR until modified by another governance proposal.\n\n### Context:\n\nLPers for Cider’d liquidity and beyond likely will want some assurance that they will get liquidity mining rewards, given there is no guarantee of fees for LMing from the Cider'd approach.\n\n3.33m GEAR at $0.015 at $3m of liquidity amounts to an extra 20% of APR on top of Cider’d fees. $3m of liquidity would be reasonable enough, especially some initial sell pressure absorbed by Cider’d. This would amount to 0.0333% of supply per month or 0.133% of supply over 4 months.\n\nOnce Cider’d is over and liquidity mining is live, the DAO can evaluate additional liquidity pools on Balancer, and/or paired with the Frax Base Pool. The DAO could also pursue gauges for these pools, which would make bribing an option. This process will also come with better liquidity data (since the token and liquidity mining will be live), thus a future proposal may wish to modify the liquidity mining program. This proposal encourages that option while still giving LPers confidence that LM will remain in place for a reasonable amount of time if progress is slow or if these additional options aren’t pursued.\n\n### Voting\n\nVote is simple For or Against (HUZZAH):\n\n1. FOR - Liquidity mine with 0.133% of supply over 4 months (3.33m GEAR/month)\n2. AGAINST - Do not liquidity mine with 0.13% of supply over 4 months",

      "content": "The purpose of this proposal is to finalize the parameters of the Gearbox Cider’d Bootstrap Liquidity plan (henceforth called Cider’d) here: https://gov.gearbox.fi/t/gip-31-1-gear-strategy-cider-ed-liquidity/2050\n\n### Proposal\n\nThe proposal is to launch Cider’d, as outlined in the original proposal, with the following set of decided parameters:\n\n1. GEAR price range of $0.015-$0.03\n2. ETH commitment range of 2,000 to 3,000\n3. GEAR commitment range of 120 million to 160 million\n4. Audit cost is 16,000 USDC, audit will be done by Chainsecurity, with an intended completion date of Dec 11th.\n5. Multisig Txns can be prepared as early as Dec 12th, with the start of Cider’d as early as Dec 13th. \n6. 2 days to supply GEAR (Dec 13th, 14th), then 2 days to supply ETH (Dec 15th, 16th)\n7. Fair trading period duration of 6 days (Dec 17th-22nd)\n8. Sell fee (withdraw only ETH) starts at 25% day 0 down to 0% at the end of day 6.\n9. Buy fee = 0%\n10. Fee is distributed earmarked for liquidity mining in some form over 4 months (initially thru cider’d liquidity mining contract). LPers during fair trade would also recieve a share of fees, retroactively (6 days proportional to 4 months).\n11. Pay 0xCider 350k GEAR for their work\n12. Curve V2 liquidity parameters will mimic the YFI/WETH Curve V2 pool\n\nAdditionally, the DAO will vote on the following parameter:\n\n13. DAO treasury to commit 400 ETH from strategic round 2 funds IF the ETH side does not meet the minimum by the last hour. The excess will be withdrawn back to the treasury. (YES/NO)\n\n### Context:\n\nMost of these parameters have been narrowed down through discussion on the original proposal.\n\nThere are also a couple of current ideas that may become proposal in the future that have crossover with this proposal:\n\n1. There is an initial idea to create a balancer GEAR/FBP pool on balancer or curve, or another liquidity pool on Balancer. Additional pools will be necessary to pursue an oracle and create volume through arbitrage. If the DAO commits 400 ETH from strategic round 2, it would most likely later need to unwind this liquidity to seed the GEAR/FBP pool. See here: https://gov.gearbox.fi/t/pre-gip-gear-smol-lm-proposal/2076/3?u=ov3rkoalafied\n2. There is another proposal, [GIP-36], for the DAO to provide guaranteed LM on top of the unknown quantity of fees from Cider’s method. Voters may consider if this affects their views on any of the variables, though general sentiment seemed favorable to the variables listed above.\n\n## Voting\n\nThere are two YES options - one approving parameters 1-12 and approving parameter 13, and one approving parameters 1-12 and dissaproving parameter 13. Voting will once again be ranked choice because we’re gonna keep forcing it down people’s throats until they understand (and because once again it makes the most sense here). \n\nOption 1 - YES to parameters 1-12, commit 400 ETH\nOption 2 - YES to parameters 1-12, do NOT commit 400 ETH\nOption 3 - NO to some or all parameters, propose something new.",

      "title": "[GIP-34] Setting Up a Legal Structure for the GEAR DAO",
      "content": "#### **Background**\n\nWe’ve been in crypto for years now and some may call us “crypto lawyers”, although we consider this definition to be not quite correct. Nevertheless, we know the market and industry quite well and frequently act not only as lawyers but as advisors as well.\n\nWhile working with DeFi projects and DAOs we noticed that many organisations have certain structuring issues: at a certain point, every DAO inevitably faces the need to have a legal structure, for example, to enter into contracts, manage IP and assets, hire developers and contributors, make fiat payments, etc. Yet, often core contributors and multisig controllers wish to stay out of any legal arrangements, remain anonymous, or avoid legal exposure, which results in a situation where there is no one who could take the lead in the creation and management of such legal structure.\n\nLately, we have been working on a new project that is called DAObox (https://daobox.io/). The idea of DAObox is simple: we set up and manage a legal structure for the DAO; this structure is fully subordinated to the DAO but does not require anyone from the DAO members or multisig controllers to be revealed or exposed.\n\nThe legal structure that I mention is often called a “legal wrapper” (in this post I also call it “legal entity” and “legal vehicle”). Below I will provide more insight into how everything works and why GEAR DAO might need this.\n\n#### **Rationale**\n\nA legal wrapper is essentially a legal entity with its own legal identity and personality. Think of the legal wrapper as a company that can acquire its own rights and obligations and has a separate balance sheet.\n\nThe legal wrapper can be used by the DAO to manage those activities that cannot be carried out off-chain, e.g., hiring developers, renting servers, paying for services and subscriptions, giving grants, and concluding agreements. Such an entity can be further used to hold and manage off-chain assets, such as fiat funds, IP, trademarks, domain names, etc. Lastly, the legal wrapper protects the DAO members and multisig controllers against liability that is related to acts and activities of the entity – normally, the legal wrapper itself will be responsible for any transactions that it performs (excluding certain exceptions under the law).\n\nThe legal wrapper, as we envisage it, will serve a common goal and not any particular person or group; as such, the purpose of the legal vehicle will be to facilitate the development of the GEAR Protocol regardless of who is “in charge” of the protocol. To put it another way, even if all current DAO contributors decide to leave at once, the legal wrapper will continue to serve the needs of the GEAR protocol as long as it has resources.\n\n#### **DAO vs Legal Wrapper**\n\nLegally speaking, a legal wrapper is not the same as a DAO, so it does not replace or absorb a decentralised autonomous organisation that exists on the blockchain.\n\nThis means that the GEAR DAO will continue to operate on-chain, and the legal wrapper will only take charge of operations that are occurring off the blockchain. This also means that the DAO and multisig wallet controllers retain direct control over smart contracts, the treasury, and any on-chain assets that the DAO has, and finance the legal wrapper only as and when needed.\n\n#### **Control**\n\nThe issue of control is an important one as in the future, the legal wrapper may be holding and managing certain valuable assets of the GEAR DAO (if DAO ever decides to transfer those to the legal vehicle). In short, although DAObox will be taking the managerial positions, the GEAR DAO will have the ultimate control over the legal wrapper and our actions will be limited by the mandate given by the DAO.\n\nThe constitutional documents of the entity will subordinate its governing bodies and management to the GEAR DAO and resolutions adopted by on-chain voting. Any such resolutions will be binding upon the legal entity and its managers.\n\nFurthermore, the constitutional documents will limit the authority of managers on the disposition of material assets and intellectual property held by the legal vehicle, entering into certain transactions (the value of which exceeds a certain threshold), and performing certain other actions – any such acts will require the consent of a DAO.\n\nLastly, given that the legal wrapper will be subordinated to the GEAR DAO, the DAO can pass a resolution on replacing us as managers of the legal entity at any time, and such resolution shall be binding.\n\n#### **Reporting**\n\nWe will be providing reports on the material operations of the legal wrapper and financial transactions on a quarterly basis so that everything stays transparent. Also, we will be here to respond to your queries and questions or (maybe) have AMA sessions every month or two if that would be desired.\n\n**Our Risks**\n\nAs managers and the only persons responsible for the operation of the legal wrapper, we are essentially taking all the risks arising in connection with the operation of the legal wrapper and DAO activities carried out via the legal entity. As I mentioned above, the very need for such a service is dictated by the fact that any manager or controller of the legal entity can potentially be exposed.\n\nFor example, any document executed will have our signatures on it, and in any action that can in the future be brought against the GEAR DAO, whether due to regulatory reasons or otherwise, both the legal wrapper and we will likely be targeted. Other than legal, there are further reputational, economical, and regulatory risks involved.\n\nAs lawyers, we naturally feel more comfortable than others in dealing with the risks, but the risks still exist and can be quite serious and resource-consuming.\n\n#### **Engagement**\n\nWith respect to the legal wrapper, we will be acting as hired managers under the supervision and control of the GEAR DAO.\n\nWe expect these to be the main areas of our responsibility: setting up and maintaining the legal entity, major corporate actions, accounting and reporting, opening and operating bank accounts, making fiat payments, handling paperwork, including reviewing and executing contracts (excluding legal services), managing accounts with service providers, such as hostings, subscriptions, servers, etc., business correspondence. We will also act as the point of contact for the registered agents. In other words, we will handle all types of activities that are normally carried out by an entity.\n\nWe do not feel like our engagement with GEAR DAO has to be limited by hours of work at the moment, but if the engagement scales substantially resulting in the need for extra resources to be allocated, we will need additional (reasonable) funding to be allocated to cover the expense.\n\nNote that this offer does not cover any legal services and DAObox will not be acting as a legal advisor.\n\n#### **Proposal**\n\nWe propose to establish a legal wrapper for the GEAR DAO as an ownerless (i.e., self-owned) foundation. The constitutional documents of the foundation will subordinate its governing bodies and management to the GEAR DAO and resolutions adopted by on-chain voting and will limit our authority on the disposition of material assets and entering into transactions the value of which exceeds USD $30,000 without the consent of the GEAR DAO. Normally, any spending of funds will be in accordance with the quarterly/semi-annual/annual plans (budget) adopted by the GEAR DAO.\n\nWe will take the managerial positions, including the position of supervisor and director, i.e., will essentially be hired managers of the entity. The foundation will have no members.\n\nWe offer the following terms:\n\n(a) A two-year contract (can be extended thereafter);\n(b) 40,000 USDC as an annual fee (80k for the 1st and 2nd year payable upfront);\n(c) A one-time GEAR token allocation: 0.1% of the total GEAR token supply, to be distributed in accordance with the schedule applicable to the current GEAR sale round (1-year lock-up starting September 2022 with 1-year vesting thereafter).\n\n#### **Procedure**\n\nIf this proposal passes, the GEAR DAO will need to allocate 80,000 USDC (1st and 2nd-year fees) to the following ERC20 wallet: 0x95e7Fb8aecca90DF207379419DE8144836BBC549.\n\nThe token allocation can be granted upon the completion of the entity set-up (via a distribution smart contract or otherwise) to the following ERC20 wallet: 0xd19841D452ea34428B549fe1Ec39da57d863dFba.\n\nThe fee for each subsequent year will become due 30 days before the anniversary of the day when the GEAR DAO will have approved this proposal, so the next payment will become due approx. in September 2024 (if the proposal passes). Certain disbursements, e.g., corporate/agent’s fees, may be added to the annual fee starting from the third year onwards.\n\nUpon the receipt of the initial stablecoin payment, we will proceed with setting up the legal entity and will report to the DAO once everything has been set up. We will further share the entity’s constituent documents with the DAO so that all members can review the control mechanisms and corporate governance rules implemented.\n\nAfter that, the GEAR DAO can decide on the tasks and objectives of the legal wrapper for the period of October-December 2022 (or another period at the DAO’s discretion) and allocate a budget that will be required for these purposes. The same has to be done periodically (on a quarterly, semi-annual or annual basis) or on an as-needed basis. Adjustments are also acceptable.\n\nI will be reviewing this forum from time to time and responding to your questions, so feel free to ask!\n\n**Legal Notice:** This proposal is made by DAObox Inc. Approval of this proposal by the GEAR DAO and transfer of the fee to the above wallet will constitute the acceptance of the offer and terms set out in this post. We are lawyers, but not your lawyers; nothing contained in this proposal or otherwise communicated by us on this forum is an offering of legal services or legal representation to any person.\n\n#### **Choose one of the options:**\nYes, approve this\nNo, need more info\n",

      "content": "## Summary\n\nGearbox is currently using the Chainlink’s BTC/USD price oracle as a price reference to WBTC.\n\nIt is proposed for Gearbox to implement a new oracle that would compose the Chainlink feeds for WBTC/BTC and BTC/USD into WBTC/USD price feed.\n\n## Motivation\n\nGearbox is currently using BTC/USD price feed for WBTC because the WBTC/BTC price feed is less precise (being updated every 2%).\n\nHowever, recent crunch in WBTC liquidity, coupled with crypto twitter FUD, give rise to concerns about temporary or permanent depegging of WBTC/BTC price. Even a temporary depegging, given it is bigger than the liquidation penalty, would prevent liquidations from happening, and in extreme scenarios could give rise to bad debt.\n\n## Liquidity data\n\nDeFi Llama shows a decrease of around 20% in WBTC total supply since the beginning of the month [WBTC: TVL and Stats - DefiLlama](https://defillama.com/protocol/wbtc)\n\n![image|602x260](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/e0gGPLWP82uZHmAV35EwdTQ6hyhOjxdCi6ioJuE820vEJMHS4SfyDqs04cdaJA65x-u4DHPZs_sUDCbW_M0FqE1q9SRhC9XhT_4EOjt0JofRHpWr-N7tlgahX7Xxx9CRYk49uuRAztlg_0WB1-dDcX_5XXzoiFnfEVW_rtf6TmxZI5nKeUu4-kuz6T4Y)\n\n[image1051×454 33.2 KB](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/gearbox2/original/1X/d6c3c359fe16864d6ea4fa89635a4b63931c8fb1.png)\n\nOur dashboard shows a decrease of 20% in the amount of WBTC liquidity one can sell with 4% slippage since Nov 18th. (The historical data from that date is available here [Risk DAO | risk management dashboard](https://gearbox.riskdao.org/?api-version=2022-11-18-12-33)).\n\n## Solution\n\nUpdate WBTC/USD price feed from Chainlink to composite oracle (WBTC/BTC) / (BTC/USD), where each value is taken from Chainlink oracle. While this solution might be less accurate on average, it would be more accurate in the extreme scenario that WBTC depegs.\n\nThe new oracle can use the same code as the one from [GIP-28](https://snapshot.org/#/gearbox.eth/proposal/0xbf7f2eac3e916c514fb80543ddf613834e60b84043d19a1007acadf8b81f008f), with potentially some change in variable names.",

      "content": "## Summary\n\n[GIP-15](https://snapshot.org/#/gearbox.eth/proposal/0x9d711e587592e8b4b98f742d7778c876a1284a6452ce8c8eb7529e2e49ca6199) mandated a 3-month engagement with RiskDAO. This engagement period ends at the end of November 2022, and this proposal suggests extending the engagement by an additional 9 more months, with the same engagement price.\n\n## Motivation\n\nSetting the right risk-related parameters, most notably loan-to-value (LTV, aka collateral factor), is crucial for lending markets’ solvency and adoption. Aggressive parameters would encourage borrowers’ adoption at the expense of higher insolvency risk, and conservative parameters would do the opposite.\n\nGearbox has an in-house [Risk Committee](https://medium.com/gearbox-protocol/risk-committee-daos-framework-for-accessing-assets-contracts-3d4deea83537), however it is becoming best practice to engage with external risk assessment firms (e.g., see Aave) similarly to how external code auditors are engaged.\n\nFurther, the RiskDAO offers additional monitoring tools and simulation models w.r.t the tools the risk committee is offering.\n\n## Summary of the current engagement period\n\nGearbox [dashboard](https://gearbox.riskdao.org/) by Risk DAO went live in less than a week after Gearbox mainnet deployment.\n\nThe dashboard recommends liquidation thresholds and also displays key indicators to explain how these recommendations were formed.\n\nSome notable indicators are:\n\n* Credit account composition\n* Asset distribution and expected liquidations according to asset price\n* Stablecoin monitoring widget\n\nIn addition, RiskDAO developed and implemented, per the GIP-15 decision, a [mathematical model](https://medium.com/risk-dao/the-double-parachute-model-a-mathematical-model-for-using-debt-backed-stable-coins-as-collaterals-5f99fb08ae18) for stablecoin collaterals.\n\nAnd proposed, in [GIP-27](https://gov.gearbox.fi/t/gip-27-bound-lusd-oracle-price-by-1-1/1848), to introduce a sanity check to the LUSD price oracle implementation.\n\n## Future engagement\n\nThe engagement will continue to include the development and maintenance of the dashboard.\n\nIn addition, RiskDAO will continue to research topics that are of interest to the Gearbox community.\n\nIn particular, the community is interested in:\n\n1. Investigate the implications and risk model of having balancer LP tokens as collateral.\n2. Investigate the risk implications when deploying on L2s (which stem from the lower liquidity in those ecosystems).\n3. Explore and consult on additional oracle vendors.\n\n## Engagement model\n\nRisk DAO is a revenue-driven service DAO.\n\nThe pricing model is 33.3k USDC payment (quarterly) and 1,111,111 (quarterly) GEARs locked for 3 months and then linearly vested over 9 months (similar to other contributors).\n\nThe proposal is for an additional engagement of 3 quarters.\n\n***\n\nGearbox Dashboard by RiskDAO: https://gearbox.riskdao.org/\n\nRiskRAO regular reports: https://gov.gearbox.fi/c/risk/",

      "content": "### STATE OF GEAR LAUNCH PROPOSAL\nThere are three current proposals on the forums to determine the DAO actions around the enabling of the transferability of the GEAR token. This vote presents all three options, plus an option for those that wish to pursue a different approach (either no unlock yet, or flesh out other ideas).\n\n### RANKED CHOICE VOTING\nVoting is RANKED CHOICE. Choose your favorite option first, and your least desirable outcome last. Should one option get 50% or more of the vote, then it will pass. Should no option receive>50% of the vote, then the least popular outcome will be eliminated from the results, and the 2nd choice of those voters will be used to recalculate. This is repeated until an option has >50% of the vote. More information here: https://docs.snapshot.org/proposals/voting-types\n\nThe intent of this system is that it will properly capture voters that feel both strongly for one option and strongly against another, or semi-strongly for another, while also preserving the expected result of an option winning if a majority votes for it.\n\n### VOTING OPTIONS\n#### **Option 1** \nis the Cider'd Liquidity Model. This model pairs GEAR holders with ETH holders that wish to provide liquidity over a period of 1-2 weeks, lets users exit fully in ETH and GEAR with a penalty during that period, and then enables transferability thus making the liquidity fully usable by the market. The penalty is used for liquidity mining rewards. If this option passes, the current parameters will be used but the DAO may launch a separate vote to modify the parameters.\nDicussion and detailed information can be found here: https://gov.gearbox.fi/t/gear-strategy-cider-ed-liquidity/2050/87\n\n#### **Option 2** \nis the Gnosis Auction. This model sells GEAR tokens from the DAO via gnosis auction in order to create protocol owned liquidity. Once the liquidity is seeded, the token transferabilty is enabled. \nDiscussion and detailed information can be found here: https://gov.gearbox.fi/t/gip-32-gear-liquidity-raise-and-enabling-of-token-transferability/2016/21\n\n#### **Option 3**\n is simply enabling GEAR transferability, letting the free market supply liquidity if it desires, with the intent to determine a liquidity mining strategy through a separate GIP in the future.\nDiscussion and detailed information can be found here: https://gov.gearbox.fi/t/pre-gip-just-make-gear-transferable/2095\n\n#### **Option 4** \ncovers a few viewpoints:\n1. You do not wish to see the token transferable yet\n2. You are intrigued by some of the other less developed ideas for the token launch, and would like to see those fleshed out further. This may include a combined gnosis auction + cider'd approach, or the gnosis peer to peer approach with LM, or another idea. \n\nIf Option 4 wins, the DAO will need to discuss next steps and for the community to flesh out the other ideas, if they wish.",

They were set up with the [utilization parameters](https://docs.gearbox.finance/liquidity-providers/pools-and-apy#how-to-calculate-apy) to reflect whatever currently can be sourced across the available positions and strategies.\n\nWe estimate that at optimal 80% utilization - the borrowing costs are approximately:\n\n- 2.1% for USDC/DAI\n- 3.5% for ETH/BTC\n- and 1.4% for wstETH\n\nThese are the back of the envelope estimations we did for what the borrowing cost for Credit Accounts would be at 80% utilization given current Gearbox V2 parameters.\n\n![LM1.jpeg](ipfs://bafkreid34s4hb6ikmg6nnczr5hdm2kiygnz5o6hymghklbuycdrlfy7dxe)\n    \n- **Stables** = seems good. Stables convex positions on FRAX and LUSD and even GUSD can offer jus a bit above (and more). So, all good, borrowers are happy enough. Because remember, every 0.5% difference between borrow rate and farm APY is actually a +3.5% yield at acceptable risks + GEAR soon. Bueno!\n- **For (W)ETH**, also good. Lido gives above, Convex too, Yearn as well.\n- **For wtsETH**, no bueno sers. On my memory, it has never been that vanilla stETH rebase yield was > the risk of providing liquidity in stETH/ETH Convex or yearn pool (the steCRV). It has always been above. But in the past few weeks, it has not been the case. And that was the highest-making $$ pool(vault) in DeFi for the last few months. If it stayed that way, wstETH would be the most obvious almost-no-liquidation-possible debt asset for it. But as things stand, it is not. **wtsETH is currently too expensive by itself, it’s an unsable debt asset.**\n \n![Screenshot 2022-11-04 at 21.08.44.jpg](ipfs://bafkreid72tsnfbikc2mubzlfcivikkkrzawltaqp23xyqqjfjlw46oobsy)\n    \n## Proposal\n\n### 1. Cut brrrr on wstETH by 100% immediately IF this vote were to go through\nSo what? Well the GEAR incentives for wstETH pool are currently a waste. It’s too much of an “expensive debt asset”. It can allow for stETH shorting essentially, but the market for that does not seem to be huge right now anyway, is it? So **my motion is to remove all incentives for wstETH pool (but keep the pool itself, no need to remove) and redirect the same supply incentives to the other pools.**\n\n**There is more potential for borrowers to realize on stables & ETH, so let’s give them that!**\n\nVanilla TVL without any sign of utilization is a useless expenditure. With this move, we increase the chances of utilization on product debt assets, while minimizing for TVL drops. The 7.5K wstETH [8.2K ETH] currently being there represents $13M of TVL. But **that number is useless if it just gets brrr and contributes nothing.** I believe some of those LPs can do switch to ETH pool, some might decide to stick around to see utilization grow, and some will leave. That is fine, the rebalances are natural!\n\n> This should prompt 1% withdrawal fee removal immediately for this pool specifically, so LPs can take decisions at the same time. Would be unethical to remove and keep the fee. Already voted for!\n\n### 2. Cut brrrr on WBTC by 50% immediately IF this vote were to go through\nhttps://snapshot.org/#/frax.eth/proposal/0x3b1509fd9347e5b409f2623a1ad84ae50b6a02da2bc7b69805c474ee3497ec32 2\n\nWBTC is a different asset, and can still yield interesting short-long positions. Keep it for now. But reduce the spending on it and move it onto W(ETH) and USDC pools 50-50% split\n\n> This should prompt 1% withdrawal fee removal immediately for this pool specifically, so LPs can take decisions at the same time. Would be unethical to remove and keep the fee. [Already voted for!](https://gov.gearbox.fi/t/gip-25-remove-withdrawal-fee/1684/)\n\n### 3. CUT CA LM for wSTETH & WBTC. Keep WETH-USDC-DAI as before.\n- $60M+ was borrowed in 5 days and that’s before ninja wave 3.\n- Protocols coming in, like Brahma and Mellow, to borrow more.\n\n### 4. Move that expenditure to other pools + FRAX pool\n- wstETH pool rewards being 0.43% GEAR supply [minus whatever has accrued to wstETH LPs so far] I would suggest to redirect the following way to other pools:\n– 35% to USDC and 15% to DAI\n– 50% to (W)ETH that is +0.215%\n- WBTC pool rewards that are cut by 50% meaning 0.12% GEAR is freed up [minus whatever has accrued to wstETH LPs so far] I would suggest to redirect the following way to other pools:\n– 100% to new FRAX pool [to be voted on]\n- CA LM for wstETH & WBTC fully going into FRAX pool\n\n> That will make FRAX pool have 0.168% incentives and could incentivize scaling AMO to $10M!\n\nSo the changes would look as follows:\n\n![Screenshot 2022-11-08 at 01.19.20.jpg](ipfs://bafkreic5tqd7leuat7vgkc7menvgmcumptvf7lxnc7xtucizowtkedo4li)\n    \n",

      "content": "## Summary\n\nGearbox v2 uses Chainlink USD oracles. So when you are dealing with ETH debt <> stETH position, the Chainlink price tick is different for both and might cause liquidation even if stETH does not actually depeg relative to ETH. So stETH/ETH can be at 1:1 yet the oracle deviations can lead to HF dropping <1.\n\nThat has happened 3 times so far, and while this behavior & risk were communicated and elaborated on - such behavior is still unsatisfying from the user perspective. The goal is to fix that.\n\n**This is not an exploit in any way. This does not lead to bad debt**. The protocol works as communicated and coded. **But, this behavior is not what users \"expect\" and it can be improved.** These unwanted liquidations arising from the mechanics as explained in this proposal, can and should be mitigated. \n\n> Churning users in liquidations is not the strategy & not the goal!\n\n## Motivation\n\nSome Credit Accounts that hold decent amount of stETH was liquidate as their Health Factor falls below 1 during big price movements for stETH/USD. Liquidation happens as it's designed on smart contract while there is very low changes in stEth/Eth price.\nLinks to the Credit Accounts in questions: \n1.

At the same time, to calculate the [Health Factor](https://docs.gearbox.finance/overview/liquidations#what-is-a-health-factor), we need the price in an underlying debt asset, so in fact the  [PriceOracle contract](https://etherscan.io/address/0x6385892aCB085eaa24b745a712C9e682d80FF681) implements the following logic: it divides 2 prices Price_asset/Price_underlying, where Price_asset, Price_underlying - USD price-feeds from Chainlink oracle (this logic works for ordinary trading tokens, for LP tokens the logic is a little more complicated, but the principle is the same). \n\nDue to the fact that Chainlink oracles have deviation (you can see [here](https://data.chain.link/ethereum/mainnet) deviations for different assets), multiplication leads to error accumulation. However, for DAI, USDC pools, this is not a problem, because the prices of DAI / USD and USDC / DAI are very stable and there is practically no volatility here. The problem arises for stETH - due to the fact that stEth/USD and ETH/USD both are volatile, the accumulation of error can be significant even if the price of stEth/Eth has hardly changed. This could lead to liquidation of user’s positions which should not be happened if Chainlink oracle has instant update. \n\nWe checked deviations in comparison of using direct stEth/Eth oracles: \n![image](ipfs://bafkreiftxhb5dnsvatxlsiuos7cl7z5ejfuopcogkphge5rhzsd47b7xya)\n\n*Source you can find [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BdxFt7F4yOzon_ddOgMF_c2tpngVKKj_NmV4o--PwW8/edit#gid=9413718) or you can check yourself loading Chainlink pricefeeds events from [DataStudio](https://datastudio.google.com/u/0/reporting/ce9b69b3-3d9b-4aee-bb62-7baab90a0eca/page/p_v00bc1y5qc) or [Dune](https://dune.xyz/).*\nNegative deviations (less than -2.5% as 2% is standard devitation of stEth/Eth price oracle) can lead to undesirable liquidations of users' Credit Accounts, positive deviations more than 3% can be used as potential attack vector. \n\n## Solution\n\nUpdate stEth/USD price feed from Chainlink to composite oracle (stEth/ETH) / (ETH/USD), where each value is taken from Chainlink oracle. This solution will allow estimating stEth more correctly.\n\n \n    \n\n",

FRAX related assets have become the most popular since then with around $20M worth of FRAX related convex/curve pools* which makes it reasonable to consider adding a separate Gearbox FRAX pool in order to increase available liquidity and decrease liquidation risks at the same time.\n\n# Proposal\n\nTaking into account the popularity of FRAX related assets as well as recent proposal from the FRAX community to seed FRAX pool with 2M FRAX**, I propose to create a new pool: FRAX [0x853d955aCEf822Db058eb8505911ED77F175b99e](https://etherscan.io/address/0x853d955aCEf822Db058eb8505911ED77F175b99e) with the same parameters as for the USDC and DAI pools (100k min borrow and 1M max borrow). This would help to attract liquidity from FRAX holders and also allow less risky FRAX borrowing and bigger leverage when using FRAX as collateral.\n\nSet up Asset LTs for FRAX pool as below:\n\n|Token|FRAX pool LT (%)|\n| --- | --- |\n|WETH|85|\n|stETH|82.5|\n|WBTC|85|\n|USDC|92|\n|DAI|92|\n|FRAX|94.5|\n|USDT|90|\n|sUSD|90|\n|gUSD|90|\n|LUSD|90|\n|steCRV|82.5|\n|cvxsteCRV|82.5|\n|FRAX3CRV-f|90|\n|cvxFRAX3CRV-f|90|\n|3Crv|90|\n|cvx3Crv|90|\n|LUSD3CRV-f|90|\n|cvxLUSD3CRV-f|90|\n|crvPlain3andSUSD|90|\n|cvxcrvPlain3andSUSD|90|\n|gusd3CRV|90|\n|cvxgusd3CRV|90|\n|crvFRAX|90|\n|cvxcrvFRAX|90|\n|yvDAI|90|\n|yvUSDC|90|\n|yvWETH|82.5|\n|yvWBTC|82.5|\n|yvCurve-stETH|82.5|\n|yvCurve-FRAX|90|\n|CVX|25|\n|FXS|25|\n|LQTY|0|\n|CRV|25|\n|LDO|0|\n|SNX|25|\n\nGEAR liquidity mining incentives shall be discussed and voted in a separate proposal.\n\n*Check assets stats on the Gearbox Dune Dashboard https://dune.com/apeir99n/gearbox-protocol-dashboard and the Gearbox Credit Accounts Report https://datastudio.google.com/reporting/a95186ae-29b4-4d72-8807-612bb5f54dd0/page/p_rpadamuqqc\n\n**Snapshot voting on FRAX proposal\nhttps://snapshot.org/#/frax.eth/proposal/0x3b1509fd9347e5b409f2623a1ad84ae50b6a02da2bc7b69805c474ee3497ec32",

      "title": "[GIP-27] Bound LUSD oracle price by $1.1",
      "content": "\n## Summary\nDeploy a new price oracle for LUSD that bounds LUSD price by $1.1.\n\n## Motivation\nAt the time of writing, buying $6m of LUSD in the market would temporarily (*) pump its price by over 20%, and $10m buy pressure would effectively drain the entire LUSD buy liquidity. This could give rise to a price manipulation attacks (aka \"profitable trades\") once the credit account caps are lifted (with the current limit an attack would not be profitable).\n\nLUSD is notoriously traded above $1 (currently traded at $1.03). It has an healthy amount of sell liquidity, which allows liquidators to easily sell it during liquidations, but very low buy liquidity.\nIts main source of liquidity, namely, Curve Finance currently has only 5.5m of LUSD available for buy. In addition Uniswap has additional 3m of liquidity, and would not be able to absorb significant buy pressure.\n\n(*) The LUSD system has an internal mechanism to let arbitrage bots profit when LUSD is traded above $1.1, however, there are no on-chain evidences that such bots were ever activated. Since inception, LUSD was traded above $1.1 in three different occasions, and our analysis shows that the internal LUSD mechanism was not used in those cases, and instead Uniswap liquidity was used to arbitrage the price below to $1.1.\nHence, we have concerns that currently there are no bots waiting to invoke this arbitrage, and it might take a while before LUSD internal mechanism is activated, and during this time Chainlink will quote a price that is higher than $1.1.\n\n**In the presence of this uncertainty we believe that without introducing a sanity mechanism for LUSD price, it would be problematic to raise the credit account caps in the future.**\n\n*Edit:* it should be noted that it is proposed to set it up only for LUSD, and *not* to: LUSD3CRV, cvxLUSD3CRV, and stkcvxLUSD3CRV. As for LUSD3CRV the oracle implementation already takes the minimum among LUSD and the 3CRV (3Pool token), and the value of 3CRV is not expected to be over $1.\n\n## Implementation\nThe bounded oracle smart contract implementation is available [here](https://github.com/Gearbox-protocol/core-v2/blob/main/contracts/oracles/BoundedPriceFeed.sol).\nThe contract will be deployed and the Gearbox DAO will set it as the LUSD price oracle, and will call `BoundedPriceFeed::setUpperBound(1.1e8)`.",

      "content": "Note: This is effectively an extension of GIP-16 on the boost aspect of the bounty: https://gov.gearbox.fi/t/gip-16-bug-bounty-upgrade-and-08-2022-payout/1437\n\n# Motivation \n\nWith V2 launching, we now have a completely new set of code and like the initial days of V1, need to be cautious about security as we roll out the product. This becomes even more vital as the current prediction for V2 TVL is around the 80m$ mark. The proposal has two key focus points: \n- Limited time boost to get dev attention from 31st October to 31st December\n- Permanently increasing(slightiy) the bounty base from 1st January 2023\n\n# Proposal\n\n**The Bounty Base Increase:** With TVL increasing significantly, it’s necessary we dial up security too. As a part of the same the proposal focuses on increasing the bounty base as per given in the below table from 1st January 2023. Given the DAO round 2 that has just gone through, the treasury has enough additional funds to increase the bounty levels. In the meanwhile, the proposal focuses on a limited time boost as below. \n\n**The Limited Time Boost:** The goal for this boost is to incentivize the whitehacks to spend more time on the new V2 code and a part of the efforts is to increase the existing bug bounty payout structure. The boost though will only be in place for the first 2 months, October 31st to December 31st. This is to promote faster action from the dev community. The values to be as stated below. \n\n![image](ipfs://bafkreiekpif6p7xghtvudkcdjv4a3vsdj43elafmbwfzf7iu6wx56wr7h4)\n    \n# Conclusion \n\nBasis the above information, the DAO needs to discuss and give feedback and the vote on how to proceed \n- Both increase and boost\n- Limited boost only\n- Base Increase only\n- Reject Both",

      "content": "#### Motivation\nRemove the 1% withdrawal fee on the pools side.\n\n#### Summary\nThe concept of a withdrawal fee was never supposed to stay for long, it was only there to prevent fluctuations during the first weeks of usage. Fluctuations refer to the fact when pools only have $2-4M and large withdrawals can shift borrow rates up-down too much. That was an inconvenience. Not anymore.\n\nWhile this is in no way sticky liquidity, [everyone is entering pools under assumption 1 that the fee won’t be there](https://medium.com/gearbox-protocol/wen-v2-next-steps-leading-up-to-e80ec39eefe4). Therefore, a few weeks into V2 full usage, withdrawal fee shall be removed fully. At that point, LPs can decide whether they want to stay for the organic APYs and the proper LM program — or leave.\n\nThis was never a sustainable revenue-making source for the protocol. \n\nThe other two are:\nhttps://docs.gearbox.finance/overview/protocol-fees",

      "title": "[GIP-24] Referral Program [Concept]",
      "content": "The KOLs who are ready to create and share the content through the docs you just read - will receive a dedicated referral link to send out along the content pieces. You can use the link separately to increase your referred degens. For more info on content, see:\n\n[KOL Program ](https://www.notion.so/KOL-Program-59d7e75d70b9418bb4c2e3cd0d2c0c4a) \n\n💰 **Cool fact:** if you bring in just $10M worth of capital, **you can make > $50,000 passively. Meanwhile, your community would also be [earning rewards for being LPs](https://docs.gearbox.finance/liquidity-providers/pools-and-apy)!** Your rewards don’t come from dumping on retail or eating someone’s pie. It’s real $$.\n\n### How to get it? - Only for Approved KOLs\n\nYou can get a special unique on-chain identifier for yourself. By using that link with the identifier, all liquidity coming in through it to the protocol - will be noted as referred by you. It’s not anything like web2 companies use in their referrals, because this referral can be seen and tracked on-chain. As a result, gamification is not possible as the referral fee is:\n\n- only given to real approved KOLs by DAO members;\n- coming from DAO revenues, so it is not eating out of the treasury. As such, **you AND your community members can be earning**. Your earnings do not come from your fans losing money by gambling. In fact, you can both be earning at the same time.\n\n💡 To get a referral link, please ping on Discord. Just let us know somehow. [Here](https://discord.gg/JssNVvxscK).\n\n### Regular payout in real assets\n\nBased on that, every few weeks or months a payout can be generated by a specific DAO committee overseeing this program. The payout will be in whatever asset you have earned capital in: that is WETH, WBTC, USDC, DAI, and whatever other [liquidity pool](https://docs.gearbox.finance/liquidity-providers/pools-and-apy#what-is-a-diesel-token) Gearbox might have later:\n\n- check on-chain every few weeks how much $$ has accrued to KOLs;\n- initiate payouts to everyone at once to designated addresses.\n\n💡 With Gearbox Protocol, you earn x1.5 as much as Binance. And three times as much as FTX! And **you don’t have to force your community members & fans to degenerate gamble: they just provide liquidity in a comfy and passive way - and earn APY**.\n\n*PS: the sheet is approximate, because on exchanges you get based on your trading volume which can kind of be recycled with the same capital by being active. However, if you do that too much - your tier would then be degraded. So we took averages. Take it with a grain of salt.*\n \n![Снимок экрана 2022-10-25 в 19.39.04.png](ipfs://bafkreig2gieroyxf3grmw5j3cvbs5ll6q4r3glbnusj5hbg3qbaq3ofilm)\n\n**The numbers depend on the pool in question too. It is indeed true that DAO revenues are 50% and they are shared equally, but pools have different utilization metrics. See [here](https://docs.gearbox.finance/liquidity-providers/pools-and-apy#how-to-calculate-apy).*\n\n**Please keep in mind that any gamification which can be sufficiently proven - can lead to slashing.** This program is aimed at genuine supporting KOls who help Gearbox Protocol grow, and as a way to support their unique content without having to bill their community directly.\n\n💡 The program is intended to run for at least 3 months, so until the end of January 2023. Those who refer can thus be sure of at least half-a-year payout. Closer to the date, DAO members can re-evaluate the necessity of continuing the program.\n\n---\n\n### PS: h**ow does the “from DAO revenues” actually work**\n\nSimilar to Aave and other lending protocols, Gearbox Protocol’s [one of the fees] fee is taken on the lend-borrow spread. [See here for details](https://docs.gearbox.finance/overview/protocol-fees#apy-spread-fee). That value is fluid though - sometimes the utilization can be high, sometimes low. And he optimal utilization parameter ***r*** can also be changed by the DAO, as it [happened once before](https://gov.gearbox.fi/t/gip-9-increase-utilization-of-pools/1311) in order to harmonize the system.\n\nFor the sake of being easy to understand, the calculations are assuming optimal utilization ratio upon which DAO earns +/- 1% of the deposited TVL on the passive earn side. Then that +/-1% is split 50:50 between the KOLs (if there is any referral link in place) and the DAO treasury. \n\n⚠️ *“What if the KOL was gonna LP anyway, but now LPed via their own link and also their friends in”* - first of all, no system is fully bullet-proof. Secondly, the result of those actions would still be Gearbox Protocol growing & earning revenue regardless. Leaking a bit of revenue for the sake of growing the protocol & its usage is a totally justifiable path. Just count it towards an extra LM reward if you want. Do it!\n\n⛔ But! If it turns out that some addresses LPed before (or tracked to other addresses) and then withdrew-entered but under a referral code, there will be no reward accrued for such actions. And **if the activity is present in large % of the capital brought in, the rewards could be slashed altogether**.\n\nDon’t be alarmed - the fee doesn’t actually come from LP capital. Instead, it comes from the borrowers who pay the fees (or rather, the spread). Here it’s just said in such a plain easy way to avoid too many formulas. For formulas, you can always go to the docs: \n\nIn cases where utilization is being lower than desired (either the protocol is useless or the market conditions are dogshit, or both) - this referral program could potentially eat into treasury assets, but just a tiny bit. So in any case, **the referral program is not actually gameable 😎**\n\n[Pools & APY](https://docs.gearbox.finance/liquidity-providers/pools-and-apy)\n\nGearbox Protocol has other revenue streams, but that’s outside of the scope of this program:\n\n[Protocol Fees](https://docs.gearbox.finance/overview/protocol-fees)",

      "content": "Gearbox has been operating in a fully decentralized way since the launch in 2021. However, like any DeFi protocol, independent developers created many useful tools to help to monitor, test and analyze data. These tools depend on external infrastructure providers. It is important to notice that it is not related to the protocol itself - as it is completely on-chain, but rather additional services that make life easier for the community and users.\n\nWhat are these services:\n\n- Collecting data from on-chain for the charts application;\n- Notification subscriptions for various events - telegram bots / discord, etc.;\n- Testnet infrastructure (liquidation bots, testnet price synchronization with mainnet prices);\n- Reserve liquidation bot;\nand so on…\n\nIn addition, to optimize the performance of these services, it requires constant experimentation with different providers. What tasks does it solve:\n\n- ensuring the reliability of the infrastructure due to failures of individual providers / a ban on the use of their infrastructure (see the last case with Hetzner);\n- infrastructure optimization (providers also compete with each other, so their services improve, new ones appear, etc.)\n\nDifferent independent developers have been working on these tools, and can continue doing so. It’s open to everyone to spin up their own service or idea, and apply for a grant for the DAO (or further on a separate metaDAO committee) to vote on the strategy and importance of each tool separately. Developers encourage every dev coming across this post to join Gearbox DAO!\n\nTo start off, it is proposed to allocate funding for backend / analytics devs:\n\n- 5k$ to Harsh (400$/monthly) for 12 months, with the possibility of extending. Harsh has been in Gearbox DAO from the very first days, and has been working on third-eye(analytics and chartsAPI), synctron (for replicating mainnet protocol state i.e. lido, uniswap, convex, curve on testnet), liquidation bot(v1/v2 liquidation with inbuilt pathfinder) and telegram notification bot for critical events.\n- $5k to DAO contributor Doomsower for 12 months with possibility of extending. Doomsower has been in Gearbox DAO for ~6mo, and has been working on different infrustructure buildilng&maintaining tasks. These funds will be used for running own geth nodes (goerli and mainnet), analytics and notification services on AWS and other auxiliary services.\nThe payments are to be made on a monthly basis, the developers provide a report to Notion which infrastructure they use and some details for the DAO to keep record of their work.",

Thus, adding limits to the Сredit Account will make the system more secure - if someone finds a vulnerability, it will most likely be more profitable for him to apply for a bug bounty on Immunefy than to do an exploit.

In fact, the LM discussion targets a $55M TVL across 5 pools, meaning that over-supplying of capital is basically de-incentivized.",

      "title": "[GIP-22] Liquidity Mining program for V2 and retroactive drop",
      "content": "## Summary\nThe purpose of this proposal is to finalise the 2 LM propositions discussed earlier:\n\nAn incentive-aligned LM (liquidity mining program) that enables CA (Credit Accounts) to function\nAnd a retrospective LM drop for the LPs & CAs that have been present till date\n\nA small recap on ***why LM?***\n\nThe liquidity in the passive pools enables the CA (Credit Accounts, aka leverage takers) to function. With the upcoming Leverage Ninja mode, the demand side of liquidity has over 100 high collateral size (100K$ or $150K min borrow, to be voted on) users that’ll require liquidity for leverage. That leads to a sudden requirement in pool values which will be multiples of what we currently have. That is a great “problem” to have though, and such utilization without major incentives for the CA side will prove strong PMF. But to enable it, we need to bootstrap the other side.\n\n## 1. Incentive aligned LM for passive LPs + ninjas CAs\n\nThe incentive aligned Liquidity Mining program (we can come up with a fancy name later) for passive LPs is designed to incentivize depositing funds in passive Earn pools regardless of the organic APY on the said pool. Given the upcoming Curve/Convex/Lido integrations, due to the bad market, farming yields have been compressed to as low as 3-4% for stablecoins. As such, the utilization curve is planned to be adjusted to have rates fluctuate on the [Aave-like](https://docs.gearbox.finance/liquidity-providers/pools-and-apy#how-to-calculate-apy) formula 2 but in the range of 1-2%. In a bull market or as DeFi grows slowly, these rates can be adjusted to a higher benchmark as yields will also go up, say 3-5%. Compressing the curve will help ensure that the borrow-APYs don’t render the strategies added to V2 unusable. The LM will be passive in nature with no liquidation and thus will be a low risk play for the LPs.\n\nOn the active, the CA side itself, prospective Leverage Ninjas have asked for small LM too, not as a financial incentive but just as an alignment for users to be able to get a piece of the protocol governance. That didn’t seem too unfair, and the spending required for it is extremely small too. \n\n###### WEN & how? Logistics & claims.\n\n###### LPs start on Oct 24.\n\nLP LM will begin before the launch of Leverage Ninja mode to ensure that ninjas have enough liquidity when the protocol does open up. That is, with votes to be taking place by October 23, the LM for LPs will start on Monday October 24th at a block to be announced earlier on that day. But if you don’t want to wait, you can already LP at any time, it’s just that the clock will start ticking on Monday.\n\nSimilar to most LM programs, the DAO will vote on a certain number of tokens per block which will be divided between the LPers based on the share of value they have in the pool. The same can be looked at as a variable APY. As the overall pool value grows, the APY will drop which could lead to some LPers dropping and GEAR APY going back up again. So while the incentive is pushed by the DAO, the APY on the GEAR LM is decided organically by the participants. We didn’t find a reason yet to make any different complex program before GEAR token economics are revamped.\n\n###### CAs start on Oct 27.\n\nLM for CAs will start after multisig executes all transactions and re-connects the V2 protocol in mainnet. That is expected to start on approximately October 27. Exact block TBA.\n\n>As for “how”, the new interface will reflect the APY LM numbers based on the [your share of liquidity in a given pool / total liquidity in that pool * tokens per block allocated]. The usual simple LM really. Every 3-4 weeks, DAO devs (or any external dev) can deploy a new merkle contract claim and allow for $GEAR claims. Meanwhile, participants shall be able to check their accrued rewards & APYs in the interface, to keep track of it 24/7 even if the claims are not 24/7. As GEAR (when & if) becomes transferable, this operational overhead can be replaced with a regular farming distributor.\n\n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreifodrbatnnx3grmx7ufrfdaaeiuh46s55ne5auo5kioxdq2jpugry)\n    \n###### Numbers: 10% GEAR APY extra for LPs. 1% for CAs. * if optimal level\n\nWe have estimated an LP value requirement for Lev Ninja mode and have curated the LM structure in order to yield 10% APY at what we expect our ideal value to be.\n\nBelow is the table that outlines the exact details for the LM program. You can find the link here:\n\nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1U4Z9Ekw5R1vIjbMnbzC5IrtNnf_jDyet2iii9LU3mIU/edit#gid=0\n\n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreievfekgdv6ym5747jyuadzgtiz333scqva7vbkbqulpbs4a3mldhy)\n    \nThe logic for such allocations is as follows:\n\nETH strategies are higher in APY and are more organic in external protocols, hence larger % total. It’s easier to source Ethereum yields these days rather than stablecoins.\nWBTC not having that much demand or external farming APY (although can be used for shorting/hedging then). All can be adjusted in the next stages anyway.\nSince the LM happens after significant developments post the last round, the FDV is taken at a smol increase to the 200M$ FDV for strategic rounds. The spends are calculated to produce a 10% APY on what we have determined to be an expected TVL of the pools (55m$).\n\n>The calculations at a monthly level translate to 0.24% GEAR emissions / Month.\n\n###### Total Spend? Duration?\n\nThe total spend depends on the duration for which the DAO decides to run the program. Do we do it for 2 months till V2 is launched and then focus on balancing APYs organically? In that case we spend 0.48% of the supply. Or does the DAO run it for a full year? In that case we spend 2.91% of the supply. This is for the DAO to decide, it’s an open-ended program.\n\n## 2. Small retroactive LM for early LPs\n\nThe early LPs are the addresses that provided liquidity to the pools between the DAO launch in December 2021 to the 13th September pre-merge period. These LPs have helped us bootstrap initial liquidity, test out the security of the pools and helped the CAs become functional.\n\nIn return, the APYs on the pools have constantly been less than 1% while the fee on withdrawal was 1%. While the fee is soon to be removed, it's made withdrawing assets a hassle. \n\nThe retroactive LM rewards the people for the staying and helping the protocol with the above with a small 5% APY in GEAR pro rated to the time they were in the pool. You can also see a smaller part being dedicated to Credit Accounts users, on a liquidity-borrowed-over-time basis. So there was no way to sybil as it all depended on the liquidity or your borrowed amounts.\n\nYou can find the link [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1U4Z9Ekw5R1vIjbMnbzC5IrtNnf_jDyet2iii9LU3mIU/edit#gid=0).\n\n###### What are the expenses?\n\nWell, none! The entire supply here comes from the savings from the bot and sybil detection that took place so nothing new or additional to come from the DAO wallet. So it’s coming from saved GEARs and repurposed for this cause! See more in the token part of the docs: [GEAR Overview - Gearbox Protocol 7](https://docs.gearbox.finance/gear-token/gear-overview)\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe LM will cost 0.24% monthly to ensure CAs get the funds required to function while the retrospective LM will have a one time 0.5% spend for a course of the last 9 months - that come from early tester tokens, and are not (!) a new DAO expenditure. As CA demand either goes up or down, this can be adjusted by the subsequent DAO votes. The tokens for future LM come from the DAO reserves. ",

of the assets conform to main risk requirements: deep DEX liquidity, a viable tokenomic model, and the existence of Chainlink price-feed for underlying tokens (except for LDO and LQTY).\n\nDEX Liquidity can be tracked using the risk-committee report: https://datastudio.google.com/reporting/a95186ae-29b4-4d72-8807-612bb5f54dd0/page/p_nm4zx1i4uc\n\nChainlink price-feeds: https://data.chain.link/ethereum/mainnet\n\nTo mitigate the risks of malicious exploitation, V2 will be gated on the first phase using the set of whitelisted addresses (Leverage Ninja mode). To bootstrap TVL, whitelisted participants have committed to a minimum $50k entry.\n\nGiven V2 is around the corner with a tentative ETA soon after the Merge, it’s crucial to consider all the associated risks and decide on the Allowed List policy for V2. The new parameters aim to give greater leverage ability for the less risky collateral assets as well as to reduce leverage for the more risky ones.\n\nProposal\n\nTaking into account V1 experience and expectations from the upcoming V2, I propose changes as below:\n\n1) Create a new pool: wstETH [0x7f39C581F595B53c5cb19bD0b3f8dA6c935E2Ca0](https://etherscan.io/address/0x7f39C581F595B53c5cb19bD0b3f8dA6c935E2Ca0) with the same parameters as for the ETH pool. This would help to attract liquidity from stETH holders and also allow less risky stETH borrowing and bigger leverage when using stETH as collateral.\n\nThe pool parameters have to be adjusted to satisfy the expected demand during gated Leverage Ninja mode.\n\n2) Set up Asset LTs as below for V2 assets:\n\n|Token|USDC pool (%)|DAI pool (%)|WETH pool (%)|wstETH pool (%)|WBTC pool (%)|\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|WETH|85|85|94.5|90|85|\n|stETH|82.5|82.5|90|94.5|82.5|\n|WBTC|85|85|85|85|94.5|\n|USDC|94.5|92|82.5|82.5|82.5|\n|DAI|92|94.5|82.5|82.5|82.5|\n|USDT|90|90|82.5|82.5|82.5|\n|sUSD|90|90|82.5|82.5|82.5|\n|FRAX|90|90|82.5|82.5|82.5|\n|gUSD|90|90|82.5|82.5|82.5|\n|LUSD|90|90|82.5|82.5|82.5|\n|steCRV|82.5|82.5|90|90|82.5|\n|cvxsteCRV*|82.5|82.5|90|90|82.5|\n|FRAX3CRV-f|90|90|80|80|80|\n|cvxFRAX3CRV-f*|90|90|80|80|80|\n|3Crv|90|90|80|80|80|\n|cvx3Crv*|90|90|80|80|80|\n|LUSD3CRV-f|90|90|80|80|80|\n|cvxLUSD3CRV-f*|90|90|80|80|80|\n|crvPlain3andSUSD|90|90|80|80|80|\n|cvxcrvPlain3andSUSD*|90|90|80|80|80|\n|gusd3CRV|90|90|80|80|80|\n|cvxgusd3CRV*|90|90|80|80|80|\n|crvFRAX|90|90|80|80|80|\n|cvxcrvFRAX*|90|90|80|80|80|\n|yvDAI|90|90|80|80|80|\n|yvUSDC|90|90|80|80|80|\n|yvWETH|82.5|82.5|90|90|80|\n|yvWBTC|82.5|82.5|80|80|90|\n|yvCurve-stETH|82.5|82.5|90|90|82.5|\n|yvCurve-FRAX|90|90|80|80|80|\n|CVX|25|25|25|25|25|\n|FXS|25|25|25|25|25|\n|LQTY**|0|0|0|0|0|\n|CRV|25|25|25|25|25|\n|LDO**|0|0|0|0|0|\n|SNX|25|25|25|25|25|\n\nLTs (Liquidation thresholds) above address the demand for higher leverage on base assets and stablecoins and reflect the absence of interest on the majority of the tokens in V1 so far. It is expected that CVX, FXS, LQTY, CRV, LDO, and SNX would be used as farming rewards rather than leveraging trading on them, therefore high LT values are unnecessary. This can be reconsidered later if there will be proven demand for higher leverage.\n\n*Staked Convex positions have the same LTs as the corresponding Convex tokens (this is implemented on the Gearbox smart-contract level).\n\n**LDO and LQTY have no Chainlink USD price-feed.",

      "title": "[GIP-20] Update Fees & Interest rate curves",
      "content": "# Summary\n\nThis proposal includes a batch of changes related to the protocol parameters before the launch of v2: interest rate curve parameters, protocol fee split from borrow-lend spread, V2 Credit Account limits for the start, and liquidation fees in general.\n\n# Motivation\n\nIn the near future, v2 will be launched, the discussions on the configuration of which are already actively going on in the community ([here](https://gov.gearbox.fi/t/gip-19-v2-discussion-pools-assets-and-allowedlist-policy-for-v2) and [here](https://gov.gearbox.fi/t/gearbox-v2-liquidity-mining-programs/)). Based on these discussions - the main focus in v2 will be on leverage farming (Lido, Convex, Yearn mostly). As you already know, gearbox is a two-sided protocol, so parameter optimization is necessary in order to equalize the economic incentives of LP and leverage users.\n\n# Implementation\n\n## Interest rate fees & parameters\n\n### [APY spread fee](https://docs.gearbox.finance/overview/protocol-fees#apy-spread-fee) \nAPY spread fee: 50 (previous value - 10). \n\n(that means that 66% of interest paid by borrowers goes to LPs, 33% to the DAO). The motivation for this decision is that the main reward for the LP will be in GEAR. Spread increase will allow to generate revenue for the DAO, that can later be used for additional incentives - for example, for the [implementation of a referral program](https://gearboxprotocol.notion.site/Referral-Program-Concept-791f353df51a449a8f7ec29725bb9f09). \n\n\n### [Interest rate curve](https://docs.gearbox.finance/liquidity-providers/pools-and-apy#how-to-calculate-apy) \n\nGiven the upcoming Curve/Convex/Lido integrations, due to the bad market, farming yields have been compressed to as low as 3-4% for stablecoins. As such, the utilization curve is planned to be adjusted to have rates fluctuate on the [Aave-like formula](https://docs.gearbox.finance/liquidity-providers/pools-and-apy#how-to-calculate-apy), but in the range of 1-2%. In a bull market or as DeFi grows slowly, these rates can be adjusted to a higher benchmark as yields will also go up, say 3-5%. Compressing the curve will help ensure that the borrow-APYs don’t render the strategies added to V2 unusable.\n\n\n|Pool|r0|r1|r2|U*|\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|ETH|0|2.5 (previously - 4)|60|85|\n|BTC|0|2.5 (previously - 4)|60|85|\n|USDC|0|1.5 (previously - 2)|100|85|\n|DAI|0|1.5 (previously - 2)|100|85|\n|wstETH|0|1 (previously - N/A)|60|85|\n\nThe choice of parameters based on the farming APY in the pools Convex/Lido/Yearn pools, which will be available in v2.\n\n## Liquidation fees & premium\n\nIf a Credit Account is liquidated, some percentage goes to a third-party liquidator (liquidation premium) who liquidated the account - and some percentage goes to Gearbox Protocol (liquidation fee). Current values are 5% and 2% accordingly. \n\nV2 Credit Accounts (leverage side) will be launched with large minimums: 150k$+ of borrowed capital. Gearbox Protocol doesn’t really have a minimum collateral feature, more so a “minimum amount borrowed”. So $150K of minimum amount borrowed is in line with the previously communicated “50K collateral minimum” because nobody really takes 2x leverage. So that is equivalent to x4 leverage on 50K (50K x 4 where 150K is the amount of borrowed capital).\n\nThe reason for it - high gas costs for liquidate some LPs. Some data provided below:\n\n|LP token|Unwrapping token|Gas to unwrap (max value)*|\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|stkcvxFRAX3CRV|FRAX3CRV|877858|\n|FRAX3CRV|3Crv|180670|\n|3Crv|USDC|152575|\n\n*This values are obtained from the analysis of historical txs on mainnet. Full list you can find [here](https://gist.github.com/harsh-98/8df8c5d3c4872ead56cc458bc5841e6d)*\n\nAs you can see unwrapping Convex positions could cost almost 1.5M gas fees. Based on previous experience, during the liquidation period, the price of gas can be quite significant (see liquidations at https://dune.com/asot/Gearbox-Dashboard). If there are 3-4 different LPs on a Credit Account, liquidation can cost up to ~6M gas. For ~$150k min of assets on Credit Account, 4% liquidation fee will be ~$6k which should be enough to cover this costs even for 500-600 gas price. So my suggestion is to set liquidation premium at 4%. \n\nAt the same time, I do not think that Gearbox DAO should earn a lot of liquidations at this point. Ttherefore, I suggest reducing the value to 1.5% from 2%. We can't remove it completely, because it is necessary for the correct work of a fast collateral check (https://dev.gearbox.fi/docs/documentation/risk/fast-collateral-check) that reduces gas consumption for users when they are performing swaps and other atomic actions.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThis proposal suggests to update fees to: \n- Liquidation fee: 1.5%\n- Liquidation premium: 4%\n- Interest rate fee: 50%\n\nand update interest rate curve (see table above)\n\nPS: in the future, as rates differences increase, there would be a bigger buffer to play with. Either in the form of a revenue share from CAs, or somehow else.",

      "title": "[GIP-18] DAO Round Part 2 - Community Proposal",
      "content": "This proposal is aimed at getting DAO approval for Part 2 of the DAO round.\n\n[See this (long) forum discussion for details](https://gov.gearbox.fi/t/dao-round-part-2-community-proposal/1374)\n\n[Also see the discussion of part 1 of the DAO round for further context.](https://gov.gearbox.fi/t/gip-10-strategic-dao-funding-proposal-part-1/1315/78)\n\nThe idea behind part 2 of the DAO round was to find a way to allow community members (and in particular, contributors to Gearbox) to participate on the same terms as the awesome VCs who supported Gearbox in part 1 of the round. Gearbox is a DAO after all, so more community and contributor involvement is always a good thing.\n\nOn the other hand, doing this kind of community round also presents some challenges, the most difficult of which are regulatory. The VCs in part 1 are all known entities, so this wasn’t a problem.\n\nIn part 2, how do we maintain the spirit of openness and community participation whilst not running afoul of KYC/AML/Security regulation. Regardless of what your thoughts are on the validity of these regulations, they are a reality and to fully ignore them puts Gearbox as a whole at risk, which would ultimately be bad for everyone. Another point of contention is how we protect people who are anon/semi-anon (like myself), and allow them to participate without doxing to the whole DAO, or indeed the whole world.\n\nLuckily, after much debate and discussion (this has been a topic on the forum since June!!), Sergey from Aurum Law Firm suggested a solution.\n\n[See this post for his full suggestions](https://gov.gearbox.fi/t/dao-round-part-2-community-proposal/1374/52?u=amplice)\n\nThe TLDR of this post from Sergey is that for a fee, Aurum will do KYC on all of those who are interested in participating, will keep the information private and secure, and will write a report on which addresses/users have passed the KYC. Aurum stated that they would do this for a flat fee of $10k.\n\nIn order to try to keep the total number of participants under 20 people, at first a 100k minimum contribution was suggested. [After further discussion, we settled on a minimum of 50k](https://gov.gearbox.fi/t/dao-round-part-2-community-proposal/1374/57?u=amplice).\n\nFrankTheTank and 0xBeckoningCat, who have been leading the charge on this community initiative, have collected a list of names. The final list is as follows:\n\n![image](ipfs://bafkreiagdjkxxkcz34dtwps3fmgyakpbrwotxixy27b2fpgxy2dkocrbbu)\n    \nIf it turns out there are those who (for whatever reason) do not pass these checks, Aurum will not disclose any personal data, information about rejected profiles and reasons for rejection. \n\nPart 2 will occur with the same terms as those in Part 1:\n\n$150M FDV with 1 year cliff lockup, and 1 year linear vesting after that. To harmonize the process for this part 2, let’s choose September 15 as the cliff start.\n\nTOTAL Contribution Size: $2,205,000. \n\nWe expect that some participants fall out during the KYC process, which is totally acceptable and will then result in a lower contribution size. The total number of tokens will be adjusted then accordingly.\n\nGEAR total: 147,000,000 GEAR representing 1.47% of total supply.\n\nThis proposal aims to put in place a strict timeline for this round to work, that is:\n\n* On Thursday, September 15: emails, addresses, and amounts - are to be communicated to Aurum at the time of the proposal reaching quorum (if the proposal gets approved).\n* By Tuesday, September 27: Aurum is to get in touch with the participants via email addresses provided, and proceed with all their checks. Participants are expected to monitor all emails and provide all the documents & necessary information to Aurum.\n* By Wednesday, September 28: Aurum is to communicate to the DAO in the same corresponding topic - all those who have passed KYC AML, and specify their: (1) wallet address which will fund with USDC and which is to receive GEAR, which must be the same wallet for this process; (2) USDC contribution amounts (so that devs can count the number of tokens required for vesting contracts). All those that did not pass KYC can be disregarded.\n* By Wednesday, October 5: all USDC amounts should be in the DAO multisig wallet 0x7b065Fcb0760dF0CEA8CFd144e08554F3CeA73D1 on Ethereum. Anyone who is late - is automatically not taken into consideration. Anybody who was not on the communicated list by Aurum yet tries to send their USDC - will essentially lose their funds, so don’t try it.\n* An x1 voting multiplier is to be used both for Part 1 and Part 2 of the DAO round.\n* In the days or weeks to come after the process, DAO-appointed devs are to deploy vesting contracts with the correct amounts, and connect to Snapshot. It should be noted that this might take into November, as all current devs will be busy with V2 testing & deployments.\n\nVote YES to approve this proposed part 2 of the DAO round, including the $10,000 fee to Aurum and the suggested KYC processes. \n\nVote NO to reject this proposal.",

      "title": "[GIP-17] Multisig Reshuffle & Pausable Admin",
      "content": "This proposal is aimed at (1) rotating some multisigs signers and (2) setting up unpause role.\n\nGoing through the latest [Notion](https://gearboxprotocol.notion.site/July-2022-Monthly-Report-497d651cbf8849979f2ed6bdc5ddc7fa) report, you can notice that some singers are basically MIA. That is natural to expect given that multisigs were set up almost a year ago: some people have quit the industry or went offline more. Regardless of the reasons, it’s not efficient and can at some point affect safety in times when asap multisig quorum is required. Current policies are [in docs](https://docs.gearbox.finance/governance/setup/multisigs).\n\nYou can check this yourself: \nhttps://safestats.xyz/\n\n### Part 1: Rotating Signers\n\nTechnical Multisig\n\nSee [at the bottom of this page](https://gearboxprotocol.notion.site/July-2022-Monthly-Report-497d651cbf8849979f2ed6bdc5ddc7fa) how active or inactive a certain signer has been. It becomes logical that signer 0x1D35DFE2c3B9A0D9f200Ee70a62D73da832606CD has to be rotated out.\n\nCurrently, multisig is 6/9. I would propose a motion to add two new tech-knowledgeable signers and turn the technical multisig into 6/10. That still keeps the multisig extremely concervative, but improves the response time in critical situations. Volunteering members have so far been:\n\nhttps://gov.gearbox.fi/t/multisig-ceremony-apply/95\n\nAs such, suggesting to add:\n\n* 0xcD25fFc7888e0cA96014dC729394E8F09Faf7706 ([Alex from Graviton application](https://gov.gearbox.fi/t/multisig-ceremony-apply/95/30))\n* 0x66a3c94814dc3a37C9d61f1a977ea3730c621426 ([Alex from Mellow application](https://gov.gearbox.fi/t/multisig-ceremony-apply/95/29))\n\nFinancial Multisig\n\nThe same logic goes for the financial multisig too. It is currently 5/7 but can be upgraded to 5/9 as it would still keep the signer count significantly high yet improve the response time.\n\nRotating in:\n\n* 0xf3D476566BCC8E882A3910F1471428522449d89E (nikitakle)\n* 0x6D526f6b4C86FBdc8e359e6bef4Cd6a42aceA2d7 (amantay)\n\n### Part 2: Unpause Role Separation\n\nAs discussed in GIP-16, there are multiple approaches to security both before a protocol goes live (audits pre-deployment of anything new) and post-deployment (bug bounties, bot system, etc). To further increase security, the PAUSE function as having been executed in times when Immunefi bounties were confirmed, allowed the protocol to be paused (or some specific pools / Credit Managers / assets) immediately upon an issue discovery. This role has so far been in the hands of two addresses run by those have the knowledge of the system / have monitoring bots:\n\n* 0xD5C96E5c1E1C84dFD293473fC195BbE7FC8E4840\n* 0x65b384cecb12527da51d52f15b4140ed7fad7308\n\nHaving this PAUSE be under EOA control is not a centralization issue as it doesn’t actually grant any other rights to these members. It only just pauses a system if there is an issue detected.\n\nHowever, when pausing, unintended consequences - such as untimely liquidations - can occur. In that case, nobody (be it a hacker, a developer, or whoever else) can actually benefit, but it could result in bad debt in the pools in case Credit Accounts’ assets went below HF 1. As such, timely unpauses after resolving an issue are crucial. And, so far, with 6/9 or even 6/10, they still take over half a day, which is not acceptable. But still, it’s a security-sensitive move (to unpause a system) so it can’t be given to an EOA. So Part 2 aims at requesting the DAO’s approval for:\n\n1. Separate the unpause functions into a new multisig\n2. The new multisig for unpause will be 3/10\n3. Same signers from the updated technical multisig will be here, no changes to the list.\n",

That happened quickly after developers confirmed the bug and tested the vulnerability. A week later the fix was made, tested, soft-audited & deployed. The protocol was thus unpaused. Post-mortem is to follow soon, see Discord for more info 1.\n\nAs per the program details set up previously, the payout is:\n\n- $150,000 as CRITICAL ISSUE to the designated addresses confirmed by the whitehat: 0xEab01F3A309f680B08a28B9ED3aFF417ca0E4345\n- 10% of that is Immunefi’s fee aka $15,000 to the designated addresses confirmed by the Immunefi team: immunefi.eth\n\nAs the DAO now controls the protocol & all its operations, this vote is to approve the payout of the bug bounty as confirmed by the protocol developers. \n\n### Part 2: Financial Multisig authorized to pay out bounties\n\nThe financial multisig would be allowed to release payments according to the bug bounty structure in cases when developers overseeing the bug bounty program confirm & fix the issues if presented. That is, to avoid redundant governance voting procedures.\n\n### Part 3: Bug Bounty Oversight Committee\n\nA committee that has direct access to bug reports and coordinates appropriate responses would be formally established. Initial members (per Discord handles):\n\nThreat assessment and solution development:\n- Mikael\n- Van0k\n- apeir99n\n\nCoordination with Immunefi and tech multisig:\n- ivangbi",

      "title": "[GIP-15] Engagement with Risk DAO",
      "content": "## Summary\nRiskDAO is a service DAO spearheaded by B.Protocol and 1kx that focuses on providing a public risk assessment framework and associated audits to DeFi lending and borrowing protocols.\n\nIt is proposed that the Gearbox DAO engage with the RiskDAO to:\n\n- Develop mathematical simulation models for stress tests of correlated assets depegging (in particular for sUSD and FRAX stable coins).\n- Maintain a public risk monitor dashboard to feature stress test results for all of Gearbox markets and key risk indicators.\n\nEDIT: Item (2) includes stress tests and LTV recommendation also for existing Gearbox markets. And also for future ones.\n\n## Motivation\nSetting the right risk-related parameters, most notably loan-to-value (LTV, aka collateral factor), is crucial for lending markets solvency and adoption. Aggressive parameters would encourage borrowers adoption at the expense of higher insolvency risk, and conservative parameters would do the opposite.\n\nGearbox has an in-house [Risk Committee](https://medium.com/gearbox-protocol/risk-committee-daos-framework-for-accessing-assets-contracts-3d4deea83537), however it is becoming best practice to engage with external risk assessment firms (e.g., see Aave) similarly to how external code auditors are engaged.\n\nFurther, the RiskDAO offers additional monitoring tools and simulation models w.r.t the tools the risk committee is offering.\n\n## The Risk DAO\nAt Risk DAO we’ve developed a novel [simulation model](https://github.com/Risk-DAO/Reports/blob/main/Risk%20Analysis%20Framework.pdf). We take real world liquidation data of popular assets from centralised exchanges, along with the price trajectory of the assets. We then extrapolate the liquidation sizes and price trajectory to the asset we wish to analyse, and simulate the outcome based on the asset’s available DeFi liquidity. Our approach eliminates most assumptions over user behaviour during market crashes, and makes it more feasible to analyse the risk of a platform prior to its launch, and for multichain lending platforms, where the data for user behaviour is even more sparse.\n\nThe simulation model is used to reason about the safety of collateral factor and debt ceiling values (and in the full report we also use it to reason about additional risk parameters).\n\nWith the model we run hundreds of thousands of simulations to estimate the expected system insolvency under each scenario. The figure below shows a single simulation run, with price trajectory (in green), market liquidity (red), liquidation volume (yellow) and stability pool size (orange) change over time.\n\n![232c4fd003d761cb0760420791c446f05ef7a2d9.png](ipfs://bafkreiehrpvdupqbtvyx3adbk733ykghgoye2mnduj24esam7ru2tmqyzi)\n    \nThe online dashboard shows the result of daily simulations w.r.t current market conditions, and (potentially) recommends new values for collateral factors.\n\nIn addition, the dashboard also tracks key indicators such as dex liquidity, oracle integrity, and alerts when whales open big positions.\n\nFurthermore, it also lets the dev team understand the root cause of collateral factor recommendations, and let them simulate different scenarios.\n\nBelow are some snapshots of the system:\n\nExpected liquidations\n \n![4a0dbec4c8e9a47781e859d1f11e96c0127ae7a1_2_1204x472.png](ipfs://bafkreihgg5w5omsserrokcmubcyszbfdt3zkkqs7dhblwzemy24fijalvy)   \n\nMarket composition - shows the % of each asset out of the collateral and debt\n \n \n![fd4803558a2a115489d6170218ca09a06733d9d1.png](ipfs://bafkreihv5765zhvn3wzmr4r4malmzcyi3cxky5z5mk6oyglmdwmxzsug5u)\n    \n\nCollateral factor recommendation\n\n![0cc1ec002595afaceb280fa277b4accb78e3bb32_2_1204x182.png](ipfs://bafkreih6t36da537yvmxilc4eeryfh6f4y6ozw2jzhvaknwr6m55scf6rq)\n    \n## Engagement model\n\nRisk DAO is a revenue driven service DAO.\nThe pricing model is 33.3k USDC payment and 1,111,111 GEARs locked for 3 months and then linearly vested over 9 months (similar to other contributors).

      "title": " [GIP-14] Contributor Onboarding & Compensation",
      "content": "[The forum post of this proposal + discussion is here](https://gov.gearbox.fi/t/gip-14-contributor-onboarding-compensation/1410)\n\nThe DAO now has funds, the DAO can work even more efficiently now, and everyone working is excited to bring the vision of Gearbox to life. This proposal aims to harmonize the numbers, update the list of contributors, and set up some rules for contributor compensation. The [initial discussions on this topic can be found here](https://gov.gearbox.fi/t/contributor-compensations-old/1234). \n\nThere are a few parts to this proposal:\n1. voting on contributor brackets (with info on who & what currently does)\n2. establish code of conduct and DAO reporting rules, to avoid \"treasury spoofing while doing nothing\"\n3. compensate the work of the past few weeks (whatever is left not covered by ex-core)\n\n## Contributor Brackets & Code of Conduct\n\nHR is a super complex process, let alone doing it in the “open”. Circumstances and personal situations are harder to reflect on in a context of a diverse DAO. As such, it’s likely easiest to have approximate brackets - and then allow some ad-hoc stuff on the margins by allowing for some small degree of subjectivity given a contributor’s background. This should later on be decided by an actual HR committee as Gearbox DAO grows. For now, the brackets reflect general market demand & complexity for each role (while being an oversimplification, of course) and make it more transparent between the DAO members and contributors on who gets what.\n \n \n![image](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/gearbox2/original/1X/26dcd54f8a6c3ad20ae1e2f750fb24dca2e58480.png)\n    \n    \n#### Keeping full flexibility for everyone involved\n\nThe above results in compensations that match similar roles outside of the crypto world, whereas here there is also extra GEAR vested to create an extra incentive for a contributor to work more and stay aligned with the success of the protocol. Contributors are not required to be online 24/7 and can pursue their other hobbies or projects. As such, there is no need for hard control of KPIs and such - which is practically impossible in the context of a DAO anyway. While those would be great to do, for non-dev roles it's extremely subjective and unclear. Dev capacity in most cases is expected to be at 100% minus the normal days off or force majeure sickness / drinking due to CPI prints. *(This is rational behavior and not just cope, because if you drink your money away now, what you spent on drinks can't be inflated away by the gubmint)* \n\nFor example, lack of motivation or lack of available work from a contributor will make it seamless for them to rotate out and not feel stressed. Meanwhile, strong motivation will result in full USDC compensation as well as extra GEAR tokens vested for the same $ value as the work dedicated to Gearbox Protocol that given month. \n\n#### Self-reporting and max hourly compensations\n\nIt should be noted that one can’t practically self-report a 100 hour week (despite devs doing that and beyond) simply because the discussions on “why X task took you so much time” would become very problematic as the DAO scales. It would be too subjective. As such, the maximum of a salary as per the sheet screenshot - is really the maximum unless some extraordinary circumstances with multiple all-nighters took place. \n\nAt the end of the month, every contributor can quote how much they have been busy with certain tasks. Because most of the roles have concrete output (not BD or sales) it would be fairly easy to understand how much time one or the other task could have taken. But just to be sure, a few Discord messages and a couple of tweets can't justify even a 25% capacity. Common sense should be exercised. \n\n- devs: in general 100% unless they took an extra long vacation (blz work sers, nono!)\n- marketing roles are closer to 75-100% during product launches, and lower during dev-only times\n- risk and analytics work usually can't realistically be above 75%, and is likely closer to 50%\n- other DAO work and designer stuff really depends on marketing activities & governance activity\n\n#### Why not KPI-based sub-DAO structure?\n\nIf you are familiar with [subDAOs](https://pet3rpan.mirror.xyz/5nsl1Xnr-BwmNAPoNeMlghPiTFMhxNg4zE7suaR0sXc)  (otherwise check the link) - you might agree that it is a bit too early for Gearbox DAO. There are some core tasks which are operational: doing some queries for protocol partners and risk scores (analytics & math), web and contracts (developing), marketing of core products - those are all very core. I didn’t find a way to turn those into subDAOs. Those are all inherent to the underlying protocol. As such, the core contributors need to scale first to a number which can then manage subDAOs without much operational overhead. As such, the current group together with ex-core become more on the operational side, whereas they can spin off into subDAOs later on (like, if they decide to lead a product suite themselves) or help manage subDAOs that grow out of the core protocol. That is for the next hiring wave.\n\n#### Transparent work process & reporting\n\nThe DAO contributors have so far committed to monthly reports (June was mumbled into the spring update as most of the June was just waiting for devs to work, while other parts of the DAO were not very active). The reports shall be shared monthly or bi-monthly (in case activity is lower) and will be on this page: \n\nhttps://gearboxprotocol.notion.site/Monthly-Reports-6849871a9bae44dfb903531c0a997e8f\n\n## How is the GEAR bonus priced and distributed\n\n-   The amount of tokens is set based on the price used for DAO round [DAO Funding Proposal](https://gov.gearbox.fi/t/gip-10-strategic-dao-funding-proposal-part-1/1315/), which is 150M FDV and $0.015 per GEAR token. This pricing for the token portion of contributor compensation is set for one year. After one year, the amount of tokens will be determined by a 2-weeks TWAP prior to the distribution of the monthly comp. **Note: According to this proposal, if FDV falls below 150m, contributor token comp will still happen at the 150m FDV price. If you are a current contributor and you disagree with this, please speak up and suggest an alternative method. Personally I am OK with this since we are getting the same price as investooors.**\n-   At the moment of the distribution, that monthly installment goes into a vesting contract and is then cliffed at 3 months after distribution + vested linearly over the next 9 months after that. *The vesting for every portion begins 3 months after distribution and then takes 9 months to fully unlock. Basically, it takes a 12 month cycle for one month compensation in GEAR to be fully liquid.*\n-   We considered using options but decided that it is unnecessarily confusing.\n-   These tokens will be coming out of the DAO treasury, as well as the USDC.\n\n## Concrete packages and contributors in Gearbox DAO\nThe names you likely recognize from multiple Discord discussions already. The last 2 columns refer to approximate monthly dedication of each contributor (due to what their role entails) in normal circumstances. That helps estimate the approximate budget for contributor compensations in USD. Otherwise, the picture is self-explanatory.\n\n![image](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/gearbox2/original/1X/85f5d132f04e740d356cfff8bebed2fdbe08f3c9.png)\n    \n## Retroactive Compensation for Spring + June\nThe proposal has been in the air since mid April, whereas many have worked before that already and continued to work through spring + June. In some cases, priorities shifted, and some members left - while some others joined. The majority of dev expenses were covered by ex-core personal funding from the previous days. As for the other non-dev DAO-native work, contributors worked without a concrete guarantee of being paid and did not rush this proposal. Retroactively, they should be compensated as follows (which is in line with self-reporting of May / June & latest work).\n\n \n![image](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/gearbox2/original/1X/45ba597e390f40e37c629801d8fb532e48f6d435.png)\n    \n*Ex-core members (0xmikko, apeir99n, ivangbi, and jared) so far do not need any DAO compensations. As they do not directly operate and have remaining non-DAO related funds to work with.*",

      "title": "[GIP-13] VIBES internal marketing metaDAO",
      "content": "## Summary\n\nMarketing and community onboarding is a very agile process, both from the operational standpoint and budget allocations. For example: small payments are a nuisance to drag though main governance. In addition to that, onboarding community members and various programs for that are a subjective strategy - basically, also not something one drags through the main committees. But all of these things are super important when growing a brand and a community! So, the goal of this proposal is to suggest a metaDAO [still within the GearboxDAO, just with clear responsibilities] which will have a separate multisig with quarterly budgets.\n\n#### Rough Key Results Expected\n\n- Higher twitter following. Of course, that assumes non-bots. Nobody is incentivized to game the KPIs as the compensations for workers are not currently based on any such stats.\n- Higher twitter engagement.\n- Higher Discord retention and more active chats.\n- To increase general awareness and competence regarding use. By creating a learning funnel from airdrop hunter → active community member → user → advanced user.\n- Increase brand awareness due to more mentions in various media resources.\n- Creating a strong, active community around the project with a high degree of involvement.\n- Get more feedback about the product and its advantages/disadvantages through regular surveys of active users.\n\n#### VIBES multisig\n\nFor smaller payments concerning marketing, a new multisig will be established [*to be added later and communicated on the forum topic*]. 3/5 or 3/6 can be chosen for it from the most active members. The reporting on the spending would need to be presented by this metaDAO every month. In any case, the work of this metaDAO will be visible and transparent in one of the Citadel contributor channels 24/7.\n\nMain members, and as a result, multisig signers for it can be proposed as:\n- nikitakle\n- mugglesect\n- ivangbi\n- amplice\n- joel john\n- hahaschool\n- qhsky\n\n### Budget for VIBES Q3 & V2 push\n\nThe suggested amount is 10M GEAR which corresponds to $150,000 worth at the DAO round price of 150M FDV [GEAR = $0.015]. This amount should initially suffice strong support for the Leverage Ninja and V2 launch, as well as subsequent weeks of activity. It could be that an extra top-up of the budget would be needed, or on the contrary - it would roll over to Q4. \n\nFor the USDC side, there is no contributor-operator budget currently needed as the main DAO takes care of that. As the main DAO scales, that will be done separately. Anyway, for now we would like to request $50,000 USDC for potential KOL payments in case they would be fully against taking in GEAR as a compensation. We would always prioritize the latter though.\n\nAll the payments and processes would be reported to the community.",

      "content": "This proposal aims to request spending from the DAO financial multisig in size of 240,000 USD, in order to pay for a code audit from Consensys. Based on Consensys' terms, 50% (120,000 USD) is paid upfront and 50% later. The audit has already been scheduled, and will begin in a few days.\n\n## Preface\n\nThe largest article of spending of the Gearbox Protocol & the DAO has always been, and will continue to be, security. We ran our first preliminary audit back during version v0.1, then another one with the full release of V1 and DAO launch in December 2021, and several more in 2022. See [here](https://docs.gearbox.finance/risk-and-security/audits-bug-bounty).\n\n## Motivation\n\nFor V2, the liquidity provision side (liquidity pools) remains unchanged, but the credit management system was completely rebuilt, and will be deployed alongside V1, using the same pools. As such, more audits are required before the full V2 launch.\n\nThe dev team has been working with ChainSecurity and SigmaPrime (both are still in progress) for V2 audits. Recently, Consensys has become available as well, and the dev team aims to use this opportunity to review final changes, which may fall out of scope of the two ongoing audits. \n\n## Terms & Proposal \n\nThe terms presented by Consensys are standard and non-negotiable: $240,000, with the payment split into two instances. This proposal, if approved, will give the financial multisig authority to: \n- release $120,000 immediately to a specific address designated as a payment address within the contract between Gearbox Protocol Ltd. and Consensys, as prepayment;\n- release another $120,000 to the same address on audit completion, with no additional proposal or vote required.\n\nTo facilitate this process, one of the development companies building on top of / with Gearbox Protocol - will be used. They will help with the counterparty details and submission of the payment. Designated wallet address: 0xD2C15E47465519789C2e6CDcCB3527d989d04955.\n",

The financial multisig has not yet had any activity.\n\nI propose the following compensation for multisig participants (as per the discussions in the forum).\n\nTechnical Multisig (8 persons): 700k GEAR/Quarter\nFinancial Multisig (6 persons): 300k GEAR/Quarter\n\nI additionally propose that we retroactively reward the Technical multisig for work already performed over the past 6 months. This amounts to 1.4m GEAR total, to be distributed among the members of the multisig.\n\nSince we have the retroactive information, I propose that the distribution be based on actual multisig activity, as follows:\n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreig45pejcdhjh5hnkyzffq64fzhfmwm5gry6tlkjmu2clf2rryc5vi)\n    \nTLDR of this proposal:\n\n* Going forward, 700k GEAR per quarter for tech multisig and 300k GEAR per quarter for financial multisig\n* Retroactively compensate the technical multisig 1.4m GEAR tokens for 6 months of work so far\n* This 1.4m will be distributed proportionally according to each signer’s multisig activity as shown in image below",

      "content": "\n### Strategic DAO Round TLDR\n\nThe goal of this round is not to do DAO diversification in large quantities, but to secure financial resources to work on iterating on the product suite and achieving a strong PMF. V2 is coming and lifted capacity constraints on Credit Accounts will be an inflection point for the product. Proceeds would go to the [DAO’s financial multisig](https://docs.gearbox.finance/governance/setup/multisigs#financial-treasury-multisig-or-5-7) for the governance to decide on the spending.\n\nThe tokens for this round would also come from the [DAO allocation](https://docs.gearbox.finance/gear-token/gear-overview). If and once this proposal is approved, the dev team would be ready to send initiate multisig transactions and send GEAR portions to the vesting contracts tied to the addresses that the parties below will provide (will be communicated on forum whoever has not yet done so). The whole process should take approximately 1-2 weeks to close.\n\n### Terms and Numbers\n\nIt was a priority to honor commitments from the community round’s [Credit Account Mining](https://docs.gearbox.finance/overview/launch-phases/credit-account-mining) average gas price spent back then, which was 7,306,296/5,000 = 146M FDV. As a result, I would like to propose $150M FDV with 1 year cliff lockup from the day of the token receipt, and 1 year linear vesting after that.\n\n-   [Placeholder](https://twitter.com/placeholdervc) - $3,000,000\n-   [A.Capital Ventures](https://acapital.com/) (Kartik from ETH Global) - $1,000,000\n-   [Galaxy Digita](https://twitter.com/GalaxyDigitalHQ) - $500,000\n-   [Zee Prime Capita](https://twitter.com/ZeePrimeCap) - $500,000\n-   [Polymorphic Capital](https://twitter.com/polymorphiccap) - $375,000\n-   [LedgerPrime](https://twitter.com/ledger_prime) - $200,000\n-   [Global Coin Research](https://twitter.com/Globalcoinrsrch) (GCR) - $75,000\n\n_Despite the market having gone down by more than 2 times since the Credit Account mining, I want to point out how chad and committed the participants have been, honoring the community valuation. Respect to them!_\n\nTOTAL currently: $5,650,000. GEAR total: 376,666,666 GEAR representing 3.766% of total supply. Even after this round, DAO reserves would still remain at above 47% of total supply.\n\n### PART 2. Community participation.\n\nDuring the DAO discussions on the governance forum, it became clear that such an opportunity shouldn't be gated from other DAO and non-DAO members to take part in. As such, _0xBeckoningCat_ made great efforts to compile the [verbal] commitments. The discussion on that is ongoing in a new forum topic, please check that out if you want to be involved with the terms as specified above.\n\nLink to discussion ([which started it](https://gov.gearbox.fi/t/gip-10-strategic-dao-funding-proposal-part-1/1315/46)).",

      "title": "[GIP-9] Change pool interest rate curve parameters",
      "content": "# Motivation\n\nExisting pool’s utilization parameters are as follows:\n* USDC pool 24%\n* DAI pool 38%\n* WETH pool 22%\n* WBTC pool 1%\n\nOne of the main goals of the protocol is to have borrowing demand. That is where the main [revenue stream](https://docs.gearbox.finance/overview/protocol-fees) is coming from and where the organic passive side LP yield is derived from. Amongst many things like product USP, general market conditions, integrations, and other things -  the viability of the APY curve also has a strong impact on how borrowers behave. This proposal is aimed at adjusting those parameters.\n\n# Proposal\n\nThe main use case for Gearbox at the moment is leverage farming. See statistics [here](https://datastudio.google.com/u/0/reporting/a95186ae-29b4-4d72-8807-612bb5f54dd0/page/mVTiC). Existing farming opportunities: Yearn yUSDC vault and Yearn yDAI vault (already attracted $1mln+ TVL each) for stable pools (USDC & DAI). That number is just a start, and with [v2 many more opportunities will be coming](https://medium.com/gearbox-protocol/mysterious-box-in-the-sky-lp-use-and-earn-gear-v1-with-a-bang-6d9b4cca0267). Anyway, APRs for yDAI and yUSDC (according yearn.finance website) are 1.99% and 1.62%. Here we are faced with 2 problems:\n\n* current parameters of the [interest rate curve](https://docs.gearbox.finance/liquidity-providers/pools-and-apy) do not allow increasing the utilization of pools, as this is unprofitable for leverage farmers.\n* low utilization creates a large gap between borrow rate and deposit rate which affects to both customer segments: LPs earn low yield, CA users pay a lot for leveraging… See that in [analytics](https://charts.gearbox.fi/pools).\n\n## Adjusting the interest rate curve\n\nGearbox uses a semi-linear interest rate curve model for calculations of borrow APY (read more [here](https://docs.gearbox.finance/liquidity-providers/pools-and-apy#how-to-calculate-apy)). Math calculations showing dependency of interest rate curve parameters, farming APR and pool’s utilization are provided [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15xqzSoCt8RYhJMM0Sp2etXRVrHzV5DOz31xFibz21RA/edit#gid=1176236687). Following this model, it is necessary to adjust parameters for all 4 pools:\n\n* Increase optimal pool utilization parameter U_opt to 85%\n* Decrease r_1 parameters to 2% for USDC and DAI pools.\n\nIt should be noted that a decrease of r1 in the short term will lead to a decrease of deposit rate for LPs. However, it also motivates Credit Account users open more leveraged positions and increase pool utilization. As a result, spread between borrow rate and deposit rate will be decreased (for example, now USDC pool has 2.48% borrow rate and 0.85% deposit rate) in long term and LPs earn higher organic yields. \n\n\nThe current APYs should also not be taken at face value, as LPs are likely in the pools to either support the protocol or have a chance at the [retroactive incentives](https://medium.com/gearbox-protocol/mysterious-box-in-the-sky-lp-use-and-earn-gear-v1-with-a-bang-6d9b4cca0267), so this change doesn't affect their incentives.\n\n## Voting Options\nVote YES - Approve the updated Pool's interest rate curve parameters.\nVote NO - Do not change any parameters (or propose alternative values).\n\n",

      "title": "[GIP-1] Proposal to add Pools",
      "content": "FORUM: https://gov.gearbox.fi/t/gip-1-proposal-to-add-pools/347\n\nThis proposal was drafted as a result of a previous discussion and made with help of 0xn1ck, ov3rkoalafied, alnash, and ilgiz. I am taking the liberty to turn it into a snapshot vote. The parameters have been discussed and can be learnt about via the docs links. \n\n### List of pools to add at the initial stage\nThese are fairly standard pools that have the most liquidity and are most commonly used in DeFi protocols.\n\n* WETH - 0xc02aaa39b223fe8d0a0e5c4f27ead9083c756cc2 1\n* WBTC - 0x2260fac5e5542a773aa44fbcfedf7c193bc2c599 1\n* USDC - 0xa0b86991c6218b36c1d19d4a2e9eb0ce3606eb48 1\n* DAI - 0x6b175474e89094c44da98b954eedeac495271d0f\n\n### Pool Caps\n\nAt the start, it is worth limiting the amount of capital at $3M per pool. The problem that arises here is the risks of liquidity crisis if one whale takes out a large loan to his Credit Account. To avoid it I suggest limiting the max borrow amount per Credit Account to approximately $40k . This means that around 75 Credit Accounts will be created per pool if maxed out, and 280 in total over 4 pools. Seems that this is enough diversification so that the system is not so turbulent at the start.\n\n### Other pool and credit manager parameters\n* Max leverage = 4. More aggressive leverage can increase the risks of the protocol at the start, while 4 looks like sufficient leverage for financial transactions.\n* Withdrawal fee 1%. This withdrawal fee can be considered as a backstop against system turbulence in the first weeks post-launch. This is only temporary and should be lifted in a few weeks. If you stay in the LP pool and the withdrawal fee is then not going to affect you. \n* APY spread is 10%\n* Fee liquidation is 2% (going to Protocol Treasury)\n* Liquidation discount 5% (going to a liquidator)\n* Default Swap protocol: Uni V2\n* Chi Threshold 0.995\n* Fast Check Interval 4\n\nYou can discuss here: https://gov.gearbox.fi/t/gip-1-proposal-to-add-pools/347. If you vote \"no\" and reject this proposal, please elaborate on the forum and suggest another set of signers.",
