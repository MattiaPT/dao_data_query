      "title": "ALGS 2023 Percentage Pay from Champs Tournament Earnings for Voltic",
      "content": "*Not to be confused with the Champs Reimbursement Pay for Voltic [[link](https://www.blvkhvnd.wtf/proposals/0xcfe4acc6ef94cf5eecf7fee8575ea62322a79df72870fb67f29595a0cf9fc1fa)] nor the Postseason Retro Pay for Voltic [[link]](https://www.blvkhvnd.wtf/proposals/0xb1565811c54c30c965dd2f06d107bb862832384323679704eb7712fd53c3d3d4)*\n\n// Background //\n\nFor the 2023 ALGS Competitive Season, BLVKHVND signed PK, a newly formed team making waves in APAC-S for Split 2 with a lead into Playoffs, and Champs. Voltic, our Challengers Circuit coach was attached to the project shortly after in an unsigned capacity. As the team began to perform extremely well, we pushed 3 specific props to compensate Voltic for his support, success, and work with coaching our ALGS team: \n\nProp 1: Retro Pay for Coach Voltic (1.6 ETH)  **[JULY]**\nProp 2: Champs Reimbursement Pay for Voltic (0.34 ETH) **[OCT]**\nProp 3: Postseason Retro Pay for Voltic (1 ETH / champs bootcamp + event) **[NOV]**\n**Prop totals: 2.34 ETH**\n\nThese retro payments were meant to make up the difference as Voltic was not paid as an official member of the signed pro team (there wasn't a prop produced to create a salary during the split and post season). As such, Voltic had requested to take 3.57% of tournament earnings. I agreed to write a proposal to put it up to a vote and was positive the proposal would be received well.  (This was discussed in September 2023 / post champs) \n\nAfter the last prop was executed in November of 2023, the goal was to wait for our ALGS team to be paid so we can recover the 15% in DAO earnings from tournament winnings to plan for next year's budget spend on competitive talent. Between September to December, Voltic and I had continued conversations about a timeline on when this proposal would become available, my POV was to wait when we receive all earnings to properly budget for the following year and then push the proposal because we could have more than enough funds to compensate Voltic. As time passed and funds were becoming difficult to retrieve, the timeline to write this prop was delayed leading to natural frustration to know if pay is going to happen or not. \n\nFast forward into 2024, after experiencing more pay delays from the old ALGS roster, I elected to push forward in writing and publishing the proposal in spite of it. Unfortunately, I dropped the ball on getting this prop out sooner (was mentioned late Feb, early March). \n\nWith this prop, this will close the chapter on retro payments for any past players or staff of APEX BLVKHVND and we can focus on fund capture from the 2023 ALGS roster as well as other props to create a better process to handle situations like these.",

This is why it's not only paramount no value is extracted from the OG HVND treasury in merging the two communities, but it's critical we ensure that the OG holders early investment into the HVND remains protected.\n\nThe Joining of the HVNDs membership initiative is an opportunity where we can not only provide both protection to the OG HVND treasury and its legacy members, but introduce a real membership program into BLVKHVND for any successful winner from our NFT acolytes auctions.\n\nThis will become the new pathway and membership entry for all new people wanting to join the BLVKHVND family and to become an OG holder.\n\n### History of the HVNDs\nPreviously, I wrote about the differences between the NFT Acolyte and the OG HVND and the complexities in merging the two communities where both are able to enjoy the shared benefits from both treasuries.\n\n> HVND SU (vain) OP — 20/01/2023 08:07 Off the heels of deploying NFTs through nouns builder, I wanted to address how our og $HVND (erc20) token works and how value is derived from it. To avoid confusion we’ve separated the $HVND NFT token from the $HVND Crowdfund token and also due to the constraints set forth from the Nouns Builder contract.\n\n> To best explain the differences, I’ll speak to three areas: ownership, value accrual, and governance.\n\n> **$HVND NFT** \n> For those who participate in the daily auctions, you are purchasing a membership to BLVKHVND, granting you ownership of that contract’s treasury. The purview of what the community votes on is aligned with the brand principle of making BLVKHVND the world’s largest esports community. Value for members is derived from the auction price, cultural influence, and how the community funds initiatives and subcultures within blvkhvnd. As a member, you can push forth proposals to help drive BLVKHVND in your own image and influence the collective.\n\n> **OG $HVND TOKEN** \n> For our legacy members, the initial OG holders who participated in our crowdfund, and those of whom were able to get $HVND when the token initially had liquidity to be farmed or purchased via DEXs, you are owners of the treasury set forth by BLVKHVND prior to the inclusion of the $HVND NFT memberships. This treasury currently is responsible for our partnership with Nouns Esports, year 1 tournament earnings, staked Parallel assets, $PRIME token, $SAFE token, as well as our year 1 sponsorship with Zora, and our partnership with ParagonsDAO. Other value accrued to this token will stem from platform fees from project STADIUM and emerging liquidity models in the near future. As a member, current governance has historically been done through Snapshot, with many responsibilities made by the core team.\n\n> Now that you know the differences, here is our plan for year two and how to build a bridge between both communities:\n\n> We recognize that the nouns Builder contract creates a governance model that is far more accessible and transparent than Snapshot. The drawback is that the current contract doesn’t enable us to manage any other asset other than ETH for the time being. Therefore, it doesn’t make sense for us to port our entire OG treasury over. However, with your help as community members and the work we’ll continue to do with our Zora and Paragon partners is to find the best way to create that blend over time.\n\n### Proposal\nThe proposal is for the NFT Acolyte treasury to purchase 1 ETH of HVND tokens from the OG HVND treasury. These tokens will then be used to fund the Joining of the HVNDs membership initiative, where we reward successful auction bidders from the NFT acolyte auctions. The number of NFT acolytes the successful bidder holds at the time of the auction, will act as multiplier and this will increase the value of HVND tokens they receive as a reward.\n\nAs a show of appreciation for their early pledge to the HVND, all previous successful auction bidders will also receive rewards to be paid retrospectively, including any multipliers that they are entitled to (see Rewards Program).\n\nThe OG HVNDs will also receive the added benefit of swapping their HVND tokens for ETH which currently drives high market value and can be used for better investment opportunities to grow the OG HVND treasury. \n\n### Rewards Program\n\nThe concept is to purchase 1 ETH of HVND token at approximately .07c, which is approximately 27,000 HVND tokens. These HVND tokens will be utilised to fund the reward pool where payments will be distributed to successful auction bidders using one of the proposed three models set out below:\n\n![image](https://ipfs.decentralized-content.com/ipfs/bafkreid4chldehzeldkyteveg7cdu6ggb6n6ih7g5gs5ktbvwvh7m3eleq)\n\n### Retrospective Payments and Runway\nThe snapshot taken at the 142 NFT acolyte it identified we have only had 108 proceed to auction. Retrospective payments would need to be made to previous auction winners and the below will show what payments are required for each of the three proposed models:\n\n![image](https://ipfs.decentralized-content.com/ipfs/bafkreiewmtn6krh5cf4ow7cblolv7utisrt3yn7ujqs7yxnvzfgax3seuu)\n\nThe initial purchase of approximately 27,000 HVND tokens will ensure there are enough HVND tokens to make the retrospective payments, as well provide sufficient runway for the rewards program to continue to XMAS 2023. It is forecasted we will require 9,000 to 12,000 HVND tokens to fund the Joining of the HVNDs membership initiative up until XMAS 2023, this date has been chosen as this is our one year anniversary for the NFT Acolyte pledge.\n\n### Other Initiatives and Incentives\nTo assist with the implementation and growth of the Joining of the HVNDs membership initiative, 9,000 HVND tokens from the initial purchase will be set aside to be used to fund prizes for our community events and competitions that focus on the BLVKHVND theme “Culture at Play''. Other strategies will also be funded via the NFT Acolyte treasury under the current Nouns proposal framework.\n\nThis will be directly targeted at onboarding new members into our HVND community and further strengthening our grip on global dominance and our pursuit to being the leading Web3 Esports DAO.\n\n### ROADMAP [proposed]\n\n![image](https://ipfs.decentralized-content.com/ipfs/bafybeih7kb5tqlibwewzjuetwqggmp6ouzstwqnxwlwbbppw6nva6mjece)\n\n\nCurrently, our first incentive design is our \"CULTURE AT PLAY\" mint roulette where minters of our \"not as sickly\" NFT by carlosknowsnot are entered in a weekly draw to earn HVND Acolytes, merch, game assets from our friends [parallel], among other prizes to be announced.\n\n![image](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/F3h1VdwbsAAVM4s?format=jpg&name=4096x4096)\n\nMore info here: [ONCHAIN SUMMER ROULETTE](https://twitter.com/sirsuhayb/status/1691234973783928832)\n\n### Management of the Rewards Pool\nUpon completion of the purchase of the HVND tokens, they would be deposited into a multisig (“the reward pool”) to be controlled by two core team and one NFT acolyte member who are responsible for processing the reward payments.\n\nThe HVNDler will be responsible for overseeing all functions of the Joining of the HVNDs membership initiative and is responsible for coordinating all transactions from the reward pool.\n\nIn addition to the above, the HVNDler will be required to update data from the auctions, maintaining accurate records for rewards payments and organising the monthly transaction of payments to be paid to members.\n\nOnce the initial transfer of HVND tokens have been made into the multsig, the transactions will be initiated to process the retrospective payments.\n\nAll future rewards will be paid monthly to the successful NFT Acolyte auction winners.\n\n### Funding\nTo ensure this prop can be effectively and efficiently delivered we are asking for 1.75 ETH from the NFT Acolyte treasury to be distributed as per the below:\n\n- 1 ETH to purchase HVND tokens from the OG treasury to be fund the Joining of the HVNDs rewards pool;\n- 0.5ETH to cover administration such as gas on transactions for the reward program\n- 0.75 ETH to be paid to HVNDLer to setup and manage all the ongoing administrative functions of the Joining of the HVNDs membership initiative.\n\n**Governing Members:**\n\n- sirsu.eth\n- uselesscrypto69 [HVNDler] (0xaf2fea8278222a8ab0f98a6386dcbe48b746942d)\n- blvk0ut.eth\n- [two additional community members]\n\n",

This multi-sig would govern the decisions made for the Production / Content arm of BLVKHVND Operations.\n\nThe 5 ETH would be split into 3 different pools for content creation.\n\n1. Production Budget: We are requesting that 3 out of the 5 ETH be set aside to pay editors who are creating BLVKHVND content. With an average of 0.1ETH per edit, we can be confident that we can produce 2-3 pieces of content per week for 3 months straight. This includes long VODs, clips, and shows like Over The Weekend, interviews, and entertaining shorts.\nWe are asking for 3 months of runway upfront in order to guarantee payments to editors are out in a timely manner, and an assurance that content can be quickly and routinely pushed out. PSA: If you’re an editor in the HVND and want to learn the content creation style of BLVKHVND, send your portfolio to atm@blvkhvnd.com. We Would love to hear from you.\n\n![image](https://ipfs.decentralized-content.com/ipfs/bafybeifknrbcvmzlcu5d7vx3j2vc7yc2yahttbldz7evtoxlooxakkltaq)\n\n2. HVND TV: BLVKHVND is hosting its very own content network, all centralized to BLVKHVND.live. We are requesting 1 ETH to incentivise initial content creation in the community. Submit videos and music to the HVND.TV and HVND.FM channels respectively to be reviewed and uploaded, cementing yourself as an early adopter to our personalized Web3 entertainment platform.\n\n-The top creator for the music category will receive 0.25ETH + 1500 HVND. Score will be judged by the number of videos posted, quality of videos as deemed by community voting by TAGS, which are accumulated by doing tasks around the site regularly!\n\n\n \n-The top creator for the video category will receive 0.5ETH + 1 Acolyte. Score will be judged by the number of songs posted, quality of songs as deemed by community voting by TAGS, which are accumulated by doing tasks around the site regularly!\n-The top tags/sticker creator will receive 0.25ETH + 1500 HVND. Score will be judged by the number of stickers posted, quality of stickers as deemed by community voting by comments and monthly competitions, which are accumulated by doing tasks around the site regularly!\n\nCreators can also choose to have their content minted and sold directly on the platform if they wish. \n\nAs a bonus, uploaded content will also be uploaded to Youtube (with credit to the original artist.) \n95% of revenue will be paid directly back to the original creator.\n\nThe last ETH will be held by the multisig holders as a pad for the production team should they need more funds as content ramps up and more editing slots become available.\n\n \n![image](https://ipfs.decentralized-content.com/ipfs/bafybeifdpxdfvqgoq66gzq2irrazh2eupmbpxdutbi4guifdjnndgos3yy)\n\n![Uploading image...]()",

      "title": "Process Documentation and Transcription Services for BLVKHVNDs Feelin Purple Streaming Content",
      "content": "### Summary:\nThis proposal outlines documentation and transcription services for video streaming content within the BLVKHVND organization. The goal is to deliver reworked and condensed video content with transcriptions of the public work sessions for their 'Feelin' Purple' proposal.\n\n### Context:\nBLVKHVND recognizes the success and popularity of the 'Feelin' Purple' proposal within the Purple DAO community. However, the video content associated with it is not easily digestible or adaptable for reaching a wider audience or repurposing on other platforms. The lack of optimization for broader distribution and content reuse poses a challenge.\n\n### Ask:\n- I propose a comprehensive approach to address the challenges mentioned above. The process will involve reworking, condensing, transcribing, and timestamping video streaming content within the scope of the 'Feelin' Purple' proposal's public livestream sessions.\n- This will improve accessibility to both first-time viewers and individuals without prior knowledge of the organization.\n- By utilizing the public livestreamed sessions, BLVKHVND can enhance its storytelling efforts and provide a lasting resource on the governance process for DAO members while also optimizing the information for search engines.\n\n### Delivery:\nThe delivered content will be published online as a guide for others to write, develop, and pitch proposals and/or be minted onchain as part of the organization's media archive. The following will be provided:\n\n- Shortened Video Files with Text Overlays: A Google Drive folder will be created to contain the shortened videos with text overlays. This will enhance the visual experience and improve accessibility for viewers.\n- Raw Transcript Files: The complete transcriptions of the audio content from the 'Feelin' Purple' video-on-demand (VOD) sessions will be delivered. These transcripts will enable easy searchability and reference for specific information within the videos. Also, with these files, future translation efforts are possible.\n\n### Brand Alignment:\nThis proposal aligns with the mission of the DAO by facilitating the creation and development of accessible BLVKHVND content.\n\n### Accountability:\nFunds will be spent on\n\n- Labor compensation\n- Adobe Premiere Pro, Descript AI, and Google Suite.\n\n### Estimated Timeline:\nTranscription of each livestream video varies based on video length and complexity. With individual work sessions under 3 hours, the turn around averages 1-2 days per video.\n\n### Success Metrics:\nThis proposal aims to achieve the following success metrics:\n\n- Accurate and watchable content with transcriptions for each video.\n- Timely delivery within the agreed-upon timeframe.\n- Positive feedback from the BLVKHVND organization and the Purple DAO community\n\n### Ongoing Updates and Communication:\nValcoholics.eth commits to providing regular status updates on the progress of the job. Weekly progress reports will be shared.\n\n### Treasury Impact:\nThe total amount requested from the treasury for this proposal is 0.5 ETH, representing approximately 4.105% of the available funds in the BLVKHVND treasury.",

      "content": "### BLVKHVND Apex Legends has successfully qualified for the ALGS Split 2 Play offs, a $1,000,000 global finals event being hosted in London! \n\nFrom the 13th of July through to the 17th of July BLVKHVND will be sharing the stage with massive esports organizations such as OpTic Gaming, Fnatic, Moist Gaming, Alliance, XSET, Furia Gaming and more.\n\nTo position the team with the best possible chance of performing to a high level at the event and show the global stage what BLVKHVND is capable of, we're exploring the possibility of hosting a world class bootcamp for the team. \n\nBLVKHVND have been in discussions with PracRooms, a bootcamp facility provider operated under the Endpoint umbrella, and have constructed the opportunity to utilise their facility in Sheffield, UK to create an amazing atmosphere for the team. \n\n**The Facility:**\n\nThe bootcamp facility has computer setups and other technology to utilize for the team on site, making it logistically much easier for us to operate the bootcamp. The booking will include a private bootcamp room, access to the common spaces including a lounge and kitchen and access to the media room to construct media if required. Players would also have 24/7 access to the venue throughout the bootcamp, something that isn't offered by other facilities and venues.\n\n**Accommodation:**\n\nPracRooms can provide luxury private apartments within five minutes of the bootcamp facility. The 3 bedrooms with lounge, dining and kitchen facilities the price presented is very competitive in comparison to other options (hotels/airbnbs) and being ideally located to the facility this is the best option available.\n\n**Schedule:**\n\nPlayers fly into London on the 5th of July 2023 before traveling via private shuttle service to Sheffield, they will then check into the accommodation and have the remainder of the 5th of July to rest and prepare for bootcamp. \n\nThe players would check into the bootcamp facility on the 6th of July 2023 and would continue their bootcamp up until the end of day on the 12th of July 2023.\n\nOn the morning of the 12th of July 2023 the players would check out of their accommodation and go to the facility for a final day of bootcamp. That evening the players would travel via private shuttle service to London to check into the player accommodation for the **ALGS Play Offs** event. \n13th of July 2023 the players will attend **ALGS Media Day**\n\n14th July 2023 to the 17th July 2023, players would compete in **ALGS Split 2 Final**s event.\n\n18th July 2023, Players would depart London concluding the ALGS Split 2 Finals journey.\n\n\n- 6 days bootcamping at the Sheffield HQ - **£1995.00**\n- 6 nights accommodation in 1 apartment (sleeps 3-4 guests) - **£684.00**\n- Shuttle Bus from return trips from Airport (London Heathrow) to Sheffield accommodation. - **£700.00**\n- Food + Drink Stipend -  **£372.00**\n\n£3,751\n$4,750\n2.56 ETH \n",

The team is set to be one of the best teams in the region and will be competing for the top spot in APAC-S to qualify for the split 2 playoffs LAN happening at London and then to ALGS Championship that would mark the end of the competitive year (Summer 2023).\n\n**ABOUT THE TEAM-**\n\nThe team is a newly formed roster with global level talents from APAC-S. \n\n![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1066185528279580753/1083035698635997244/Allplayers.png)  **StrafingFlame**[(Liquipedia)](https://liquipedia.net/apexlegends/StrafingFlame) is the team IGL and has won the split 1 of pro league with his previous team . He qualified for split 1 playoffs LAN which happened at London in February 2023 , his team being the top seed from the region and is ready to win another split with this new roster that he has built . A very mechanical and knowledgeable player who knows what it takes to compete for the top.\n\n**EzFlash** [(Liquipedia)](https://liquipedia.net/apexlegends/EzFlash) has always been considered as one of the best players in the region who has been carrying his team to consistent top 5 finishes in APAC-S. He has qualified for year 2 split 2 playoffs LAN in 2022 and also for the year 3 split 1 playoffs LAN this year. Having two players who qualified for the previous split 1 playoffs LAN , the team looks set to take a top spot in the region and qualify for the coming split 2 playoffs LAN and then the championship. EzFlash was also top fragger in the region with highest average \ndamage per game during split 1 pro league .([EzFlash damage](https://mobile.twitter.com/im_b_rad_ttv/status/159819257013983232)).\n\n**Buegy** [(Liquipedia)](https://liquipedia.net/apexlegends/Buegy) , as a third, rounds up the roster very well being a controller player who brings solid value when it comes to interactions and teamfights. Teaming up with two of the best players in the region, he is very hungry to show his actual potential. \n\nThe team recently played their first big tournament together and put up an insane performance ending 2nd place. ([Tournament link](https://liquipedia.net/apexlegends/Douyu/2023/Defender_Cup/Season_1))\nEach one of the players on the team is putting in insane grind to make sure the competition stands no chance against them! \n\n**GOALS AS A TEAM**-\n- Dominate split 2 of pro league in APAC-South and be the top seed from the region going to split 2 playoffs LAN at London\n- Perform at the split 2 playoffs and secure a spot in ALGS Championship \n- Do regular content and streams with all the players to grow the socials and build up a solid fanbase around the team \n\n**About ALGS and APAC-South** - \n- APAC-South has shown solid growth in 2022-23 , the regional viewership numbers went from 2k average and 4k peak viewers during last season's second split to 6-7k average and 11-12k peak viewers during the new season's first split and these numbers are set to keep growing with time as the level of competition keeps improving and the overall apex fanbase in APAC keeps getting bigger . \n- At the split 1 playoffs LAN that happened February 2023 at London , APAC-S was the second best performing region after North America and it was fairly close considering APAC-S gets half number of spots than NA.\n- The LAN viewership for apex has been insane , the average being around 300k and peak around 700k viewers. Although being a relatively newer scene, it was ranked 7th highest esport viewership wise in 2022.\n- The yearly total prizepool for apex esports is 5,000,000 USD , 2 million usd goes to two playoffs LANs , 2 million is the prizepool of the algs championship and the rest 1 million is divided for different regional pro leagues. The prizepool of APAC-S pro league per split is 62,500 usd.\n\n[Split 2 Pro League](https://liquipedia.net/apexlegends/Apex_Legends_Global_Series/2023/Split_2/Pro_League/APAC_South)\n\n\n[Split 2 Playoffs (LAN)](https://liquipedia.net/apexlegends/Apex_Legends_Global_Series/2023/Split_2/Playoffs )\n\n\n![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1066185528279580753/1082976015955021854/ALGSPAGE.png)\n\n**THE ASK-**\nThe team is looking for 2.2 eth per month budget which will include three players and a manager for a duration of 2 months which will cover the whole ALGS Pro league split 2 .\nThe contract would then be extended to cover split 2 playoffs LAN once the team qualifies for it through the pro league and same for ALGS championship. \nThe team will have a standard 85-15% prizepool split with the organization where 85% goes to the team.\n\n**WHY SIGN THE TEAM** - \n\n- The team is a highly impactful roster in a region where its easier to create an impact because of less big orgs being present than in regions like NA and EU that are already very stacked. The support for the team can be channeled by the organization to push social media numbers, merch, nft sales etc .\n\n\n- The team has players who have proven themselves in every league and tournament they have played recently . With the IGL that has won the region last split and the player who was the best fragger in the region during the last split , the chances of success during split 2 is very high that makes the project a low risk one for the organization. With that, blvkhvnd should be able to make it to a big LAN , the ALGS playoffs split 2 , and compete with top tier orgs from all over the world. LANs would also enable good potential sponsorship opportunities for the organization.\n\n\n- The project can unlock the whole APAC region for STADIUM to host good quality tournaments on apex , and if promoted well, will get the spotlight because of lack of good quality tournaments in the region.\n\n\n- Good quality content can be created around the team be it during pro league or during the LAN events. All the players are willing to stream and do regular content to make sure the org growth is steady and can also help massively with promoting merch, boosting nft sales etc.\n\n- With a team that can qualify for LANs consistently and be able to compete with the biggest T1 orgs for the global titles, chances of securing good sponsorships would be high.",

Should our roster fail to reach top marks before the end of the first split, we will reassess continued support of this proposal. Should we come to terms that we cannot resolve our performance, players will receive prorated compensation and any remaining funds will be sent back to the treasury.***\n\n***This proposal also acts as a working contract between Slime4KT and BLVKHVND DAO. For additional information, view our [standard player agreement.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TAiAJShzwOEE3I-i_ylNsYCeNR6j_oSDKLoR5ohTv1Q/edit?usp=sharing)***\n\n\n**PROLOGUE**\n\nIn 2022, BLVKHVND had many teams creating unique stories and experiences for our community and contributors. From traditional FPS esports to mobile, we were interested in discovering the best opportunities to build our brand and competitive dynasty. The most rewarding and successful was Pokemon Unite and Mobile Esports. Winning the North American regionals and World Championship in our first year was monumental. Not only was it the inaugural Pokemon Unite World Championship, we were also the first Esports DAO to win a major espoorts tournament and the first North American global champion in Mobile Esports history. An unforgettable experience that propelled the BLVKHVND brand into the Esports spotlight, forever etching our name into the history of Pokemon and Esports.\n\nThrough much consideration, the core team at BLVKHVND believes that with the potential of the genre, and the history of our brand, mobile esports presents a very promising opportunity of success and growth for the DAO, and our impact across the esports industry as a whole. \n\n\n**PROPOSAL**\n\nBLVKHVND Core Team wants to plant deeper roots in mobile esports and expand our reach in Africa with an acquisition of the top PUBG Mobile Nigerian team Slime4KT for the 2023 Season. \n\n\n**GOALS**\n\n+ Qualify for the PUBG Mobile 2023 Global Championship in Turkey\n+ Qualify for the PUBG Mobile 2023 World Invitational in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia\n+ Develop a social following in Africa\n+ Develop content around the competitive season (match day, highlights, interviews)\n+ Develop fan activations (URL & IRL) via merch, digital collectibles, and more\n+ Foster a crypto-native culture to onboard players into using crypto through BLVKHVND\n\n\n**THE ASK**\n\nWe are asking for 13.5 ETH to be distributed over a 9 month period to fund the team’s 4-player roster, 1 substitute, and team manager. The DAO receives 45% of tournament winnings the team earns for the entire season, invitationals, world championship, and any other events we participate in in 2023. \n\nFunds will be sent to a multisig composed of 3 core team members and 2 community members interested in team management. After funds are sent to the multisig, the committee will issue monthly payments to the players and relevant staff. \n\nMultisig holders:\n\n- sirsu.eth\n- teelon\n- blvk0ut\n- valcoholics.eth\n- hawx.eth\n\n\n**PLAYER ROSTER**\n\n- 33Storm - Nigeria\n- 77Plaza - Morocco\n- Coa77 - Serbia\n- Cale - Bosnia and Herzegovina\n- Redox - Moldova\n\n[View their Liquipedia ](https://liquipedia.net/pubgmobile/SLIME_4KT)\n\n\n**ABOUT THE LEAGUE**\n\nCompeting in the PUBG Mobile Pro League: Africa during the 2023 season.\n\nTwo seasonal splits, Spring and Fall, serve as qualifier events into the MEA (Middle East and Africa) Championships, The PUBG Mobile World Invitational and the PUBG Mobile Global Championships. The PUBG MPL: Africa has a combined prize pool of $200,000 USD over the two splits. The events that feed off the regional series have a combined prize pool of $6,300,000 USD. The World Invitational and the Global Championships make up for the majority of that total prize pool ($6,000,000), This team did not qualify for those events last year however they were very close and are definitely capable of earning qualification this year. \n\nAll of the PUBG Mobile circuit has official broadcasts in English. Additionally the African region is supported with an Arabic broadcast. The major events broadcasts are accessible in many different languages.\n\n[Watch Last Season](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUqqZaWwic-PUIzoznnrtjzz3JQ0A78ke)\n\n\n**ADDITIONAL INFORMATION**\n\nThe Slime4KT team was created in Oct 2019 and started competing in the 2021 season.  The roster in the 2022 season earned a total of $31K in tournament winnings accounting for 75% of their total earnings as an unsigned team. Financially, with the 45% split of tournament earnings between our roster and the DAO, if we secure qualification to the World Invitational or Global Championship, we are net positive in our expenditure from tournament earnings alone. Combine this with active fan engagement and conversion through streams, merch, and NFTs, this team can potentially become the first BLVKHVND team to sustainably make a profit for the DAO. \n",

Despite those challenges, we did build a lot of great relationships and built some great memories along the way.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent;\">With that being said, we've gotten some interest from previous players to support them in the upcoming LAN event for Halo Infinite. The first LAN of the season is often the biggest with fans pouring in from all over the world to see their teams duke it out on the main stage or go to war in the open bracket. Based on the changes this year, it's more important than ever to shine a light on the best talent from EU / MX / ANZ and we are one of the best newer orgs to bring awareness and support to those regions.&nbsp;</span></p><p><br></p><p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFzH6NHNLiE\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"background-color: transparent;\">BLVKHVND YEAR ONE VALENCIA DOC</a></p><p><br></p><p><strong>THE PROPOSAL</strong></p><p><em style=\"background-color: transparent;\">Sponsor 6th Seed Team to Charlotte LAN</em></p><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent;\">The team lead by three of our previous members LUNNY, TURK, and RIOTZ placed top 6 in the online qualifier before LAN.

After a brief hiatus from their partnership and some unexpected performances in season 1 of Halo Infinite. They have now decided to reform their partnership and create a team capable of competing with the best teams not only in Europe but Globally.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent;\">With that in mind the team recruited Kimbo, who boasts the highest European placement at an international event of (top6) from his time with previous team Navi (@Natusvincere) and Hollers who is a veteran player having competed since 2015 and participating in 5 international tournaments. Due to uncontrollable circumstances this team only formed on the day prior to the qualifying tournament so was unable to practice as a team in preparation.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent;\">Even with the enormous deficit playing versus practiced teams the team showed what they are capable of narrowly losing to Wreckers and Employed 1-2 and with practice we know we are capable of beating anybody who gets in our way at the event.</span></p><p><br></p><p><strong style=\"background-color: transparent;\">ADDITIONAL CONTENT</strong></p><p><em style=\"background-color: transparent;\">Lunny&nbsp;</em></p><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/CaseyLunny\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(17, 85, 204);\">https://twitter.com/CaseyLunny</a><a href=\"https://twitter.com/CaseyLunny\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">\t</a></p><p><a href=\"https://halo-esports.fandom.com/wiki/Lunny\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(17, 85, 204);\">https://halo-esports.fandom.com/wiki/Lunny</a></p><p><br></p><p><em style=\"background-color: transparent;\">Riotz</em></p><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/interRiotz\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(17, 85, 204);\">https://twitter.com/interRiotz</a><a href=\"https://twitter.com/interRiotz\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">\t</a></p><p><a href=\"https://halo-esports.fandom.com/wiki/Riotz\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(17, 85, 204);\">https://halo-esports.fandom.com/wiki/Riotz</a></p><p><br></p><p><em style=\"background-color: transparent;\">Kimbo</em></p><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/Kimboelzein\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(17, 85, 204);\">https://twitter.com/Kimboelzein</a><a href=\"https://twitter.com/Kimboelzein\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">\t</a></p><p><a href=\"https://halo-esports.fandom.com/wiki/Kimbo\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(17, 85, 204);\">https://halo-esports.fandom.com/wiki/Kimbo</a></p><p><br></p><p><em style=\"background-color: transparent;\">Hollers</em></p><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/HollersEU\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(17, 85, 204);\">https://twitter.com/HollersEU</a><a href=\"https://twitter.com/HollersEU\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">\t</a></p><p><a href=\"https://halo-esports.fandom.com/wiki/Hollers?so=search\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(17, 85, 204);\">https://halo-esports.fandom.com/wiki/Hollers</a></p><p><br></p><p><em style=\"background-color: transparent;\">Turk</em></p><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/Turkledore\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(17, 85, 204);\">https://twitter.com/Turkledore</a><a href=\"https://twitter.com/Turkledore\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">\t</a></p><p><a href=\"https://halo-esports.fandom.com/wiki/Turkledore\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(17, 85, 204);\">https://halo-esports.fandom.com/wiki/Turkledore</a><a href=\"https://halo-esports.fandom.com/wiki/Turkledore\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">\t</a></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>",

      "content": "<p><strong>From the BLVKHVND Team Captain Voltic:</strong></p><p>\"Hey all! Voltic from the Apex team here! There is currently a 80,000$ lan tournament going on that we would love to be apart of which I promise you we will be a top finalist if not 1st overall however there is a entry fee of 200$. With some support on our team we will be able to enter and we will be streaming the event as well so all of you guys can tune in to see how the hardest BR plays out.\"</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Opportunity:</strong></p><p>The PHASE ONE APEX TOURNAMENT is a mixed series (online + LAN) of tournaments with a total of $80k in prizes. For BLVKHVND, as our team gears up for the ALGS Pro Qualifier, PHASE ONE's Pro-Am series gives our team exposure to a wider APEX audience, immense potential to win big, and practice reps to get us closer to our goal in playing in the APEX LEGENDS GLOBAL SERIES as a Pro Team. </p><p>From a DAO perspective, the exposure our APEX team currently has is very high, having performed well in series like Nerd Street Summer Champs and Series E (by Esports Arena). Continued success in APEX will give us rich content we can create to proliferate BLVKHVND through mintable works created from our treasury. </p><p><br></p><p><strong>Earnings Breakdown:</strong></p><p>Based upon typical esports player to org arrangements, players receive 80% of all tournament winnings and BLVKHVND Treasury receives 20%. Because PHASE ONE is not crypto native, funds received by Voltic will be in USD and have to be converted to ETH. A secondary proposal will be created to discuss the collection of funds and any legal requirements needed to protect members and put the fiduciary responsibility to the DAO treasury and core team members.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Other Considerations:</strong></p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.phaseoneesports.com/tournaments\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">PHASE ONE TOURNAMENT</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hgs_dcTRS0\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Nerd Street Summer Champs Video</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtfLGdaPTNE&amp;t=208s\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">BLVKHVND APEX Video</a></li></ul>",
