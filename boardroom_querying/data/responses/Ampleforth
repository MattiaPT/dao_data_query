      "content": "# [](#p-2071-summary-1)Summary\n\nSteepen rebase curve and tighten equilibrium bands to promote faster equilibrium discovery\n\n## [](#p-2071-abstract-2)Abstract\n\nThis proposes an update to the growth, upper asymptote, and lower asymptote configuration parameters of the Sigmoid reaction lag function. Additionally, it proposes tightening the equilibrium band within which no rebases occur.\n\n## [](#p-2071-motivation-3)Motivation\n\nThe Sigmoid function ([implemented in AIP-5](https://aips.ampleforth.org/AIPs/aip-5)) replaced a linear function with an S-shaped function, allowing for sophisticated supply reaction tuning. However, to ease this transition, AIP-5 kept the steepest segment of the new curve as similar as possible to that of the original linear function. For commentary on the original proposal see: [Rebase curve upgrade proposal](https://forum.ampleforth.org/t/rebase-curve-upgrade-proposal/327)\n\nThere is now sufficient reason to believe that a steeper slope would result in a tighter price distribution around the target, and thus better serve AMPL’s unit of account function. Recognizing that the primary source of price discovery and liquidity exists on constant product AMM’s, we can more precisely estimate the supply change required to bring price into equilibrium as:\n\n* *An **X% price deviation** requires an **X% supply adjustment** to restore price equilibrium.*\n\nMoreover, tightening equilibrium bands (ie: the threshold of tolerance within which no rebases occur) would allow the system to adjust granularly according to smaller changes in demand rather than waiting until price is 5% away from its target to take effect, causing AMPL To spend more time at its precise target.\n\n## [](#p-2071-specification-4)Specification\n\nRecall that the sigmoid function curve is defined by:\n\n![Screenshot 2024-08-27 at 11.12.24 AM](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard14/uploads/governance1/optimized/1X/454c68439aa77f880fbeae012c2295b67e4368fb_2_345x104.png)\n\n* F(x) : fraction of supply added or removed (supply change %)\n* x : normalized price deviation\n\nIt has shaping parameters that determine: lower asymptote, upper asymptote, and the steepness of the curve (ie: growth rate).\n\n* l = lower asymptote\n* u = upper asymptote\n* g = growth rate\n\n## [](#p-2071-proposed-parameter-values-5)Proposed Parameter Values\n\nThis update proposes changing the parameter values to:\n\n* l = -0.077\n* u = 0.05\n* g = 45\n\nThe resulting reaction lag curve looks as follows:\n\n![download (2)](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard14/uploads/governance1/optimized/1X/ee63b672d5593e8b111de65595f2ddc0aa60a78e_2_690x354.png)\n\nThe red line, pictured above, represents a linear curve that would offset an X% price deviation with an X% supply change.\n\nThe proposed parameter changes produce a sigmoid curve that closely resembles the slope of the red line near the origin, but asymptotes horizontally at a max supply change of +5% above and -7.7% below AMPL’s price target.\n\nThis update also proposes changing the deviation ratio values:\n\n* deviation\\_ratio = 0.025\n\n## [](#p-2071-conclusion-6)Conclusion\n\nThe Ampleforth protocol’s rebase reaction curve will keep its existing structure, but will more quickly and precisely adjust supply in response to demand, such that AMPL spends a maximum amount of time near its target.",

The application for LP deposits and withdrawals will be live shortly.\n\n### Actively Managed Charm Vault\nFor WAMPL/WETH liquidity, there is a new [actively managed Charm vault](https://alpha.charm.fi/ethereum/vault/0x9658b5bdcad59dd0b7b936d955e5df81ea2b4dcb), which provides a turnkey solution for AMPL LPs on Uniswap V3. This has a number of benefits over providing liquidity on Uni V2:\n- Higher fee tier\n- Concentrated liquidity, 2x capital efficiency\n- Significantly better performance vs infinite band\n\n### Aerodrome\nA new [SPOT/USDC Aerodrome pair](https://blog.ampleforth.org/the-spot-usdc-pair-on-aerodrome-1dde54f91222) went live on the Base L2 platform. This has currently collected $1.25M in TVL with an APR of 38.41% on this stable-like pair.\n\n# Treasury Spotlight\nBelow is a snapshot of DAO controlled assets, as of August 22nd, 2024.

      "content": "# Ecosystem State\n\nThe proposal to begin rollout of Spot v2 [is live](https://forum.ampleforth.org/t/proposal-initiate-rollout-of-spot-v2) and so far showing solid support. This is a natural time to reexamine the structure of SPOT liquidity so we can ensure it's serving the needs of the market and protocol.\n\n@Togenkyo suggested [here](https://forum.ampleforth.org/t/adjust-liquidity-range-of-the-spot-usdc-arrakis-vault) that the bands of the SPOT Arrakis vault are due to be updated. When the vault was first launched in January of 2023, the bands were set such that the AMPL price target was at the lower end. Now, the price target has approached nearly the top bound.\n\nDemand for SPOT leading up to the rollout has exceeded these concentrated bands and, while the price has shown a remarkable ability to come down again towards the target, better liquidity provisioning could have reduced some of the unnecessary intermediary price action.\n\nAnother factor is that, provided the v2 rollout executes, we may [expect more short term volatility](https://blog.ampleforth.org/how-spot-v2-makes-arbitrage-more-efficient-4b5c13acaa95) of SPOT as the markets develop. So we should generally prefer wider bands in the near term, on top of moving them upwards.\n\nGiven the simplicity of the Arrakis v1 vault system, the best way to update bands is to migrate to a new vault. If so, this is also an opportunity to leverage [new v2 architecture](https://resources.arrakis.fi/arrakis-v2-protocol/introduction) from Arrakis that can be more dynamic in its liquidity management. This could simultaneously increase LP efficiency (leading to more fees) and decrease the need for future migrations.\n\nThe DAO could consider future programs on satellite networks, such as Base. But it's likely prudent to first ensure a healthy SPOT v2 ecosystem on Ethereum L1, before complicating the market and arbitrage structure with additional platforms. However, since these are open markets, anyone who would like to participate on the Base platform in the meantime can absolutely move forward as they desire. There is already $267k of SPOT liquidity on Aerodrome, and $557k of WAMPL liquidity on Base Uniswap v3.\n\n# DAO Owned Liquidity\n\nThe FORTH PALM Vault ([dashboard](https://dashboard.arrakis.finance/?network=ethereum\\&vault=0xe2cbdbc298d884a2ded6b554702f514ed3364264)) has been [highly successful](https://forum.ampleforth.org/t/proposal-use-arrakis-palm-for-deepening-dao-owned-liquidity/641/12) in delivering on the DAO's goals of bootstrapping liquidity. The performance of the vault is +21% vs hodling. This performance is something we can double down on, by allocating more FORTH tokens to what is already in the vault.\n\nThe DAO currently owns ~$1M in [FORTH/ETH liquidity](https://dashboard.arrakis.finance/?network=ethereum\\&vault=0xe2cbdbc298d884a2ded6b554702f514ed3364264), and ~$3.5M in [AMPL/ETH liquidity](https://etherscan.io/token/0xc5be99a02c6857f9eac67bbce58df5572498f40c?a=0x223592a191ecfc7fdc38a9256c3bd96e771539a9). Additionally, the $500k USDC position can be used for future SPOT liquidity, if the DAO mints enough SPOT tokens to match.\n\n# Proposed Configuration\n\n| Geyser            | Platform   | Pair      | Chain    | FORTH Amount |\n| ----------------- | ---------- | --------- | -------- | -----------: |\n| Beehive v7        | Uniswap v2 | ETH/AMPL  | Ethereum | 25,000 FORTH |\n| Fly v2 (Superfly) | Uniswap v3 | SPOT/USDC | Ethereum | 35,000 FORTH |\n| Total             |            |           |          | 60,000 FORTH |\n\nProposed allocation to PALM liquidity: 700K FORTH, which would bring the vault back to the 90:10 FORTH:ETH ratio it started with.",

It was launched with a conservative configuration of [20/80], with the assumption that it would be relaxed over time. Last May, [it was updated to [25/75]](https://forum.ampleforth.org/t/proposal-to-update-the-tranche-ratios-for-spots-collateral/664/17).\n\nThe most AMPL supply has contracted within 28 days, since [the Sigmoid rebase curve was instated](https://forum.ampleforth.org/t/rebase-curve-upgrade-proposal/327) on March 26th 2022, is 40%.\n\nIt's also worth noting that the rebase multiplier of the Rotation Vault would not change instantaneously with this update. It would rotate in slowly over the course of a month as new bonds come into the system and old bonds leave the system.",

      "content": "[Governance Forum Discussion](https://forum.ampleforth.org/t/geyser-refresh-for-q4-2023 \"Governance Forum Discussion\")\n\n# Ecosystem State\n\nSPOT is closing in on it’s 1 year anniversary next month. It’s so far shown resilience through a fairly protracted down market period. The Spot Rotation Vault (aka stAMPL) was [launched 3 months ago 1](https://blog.ampleforth.org/the-spot-rotation-vault-4f1e9e7d408b) and in that short time has already amassed [6.5% of the AMPL network](https://app.spot.cash/vault).\n\nAMPL has seen some growth lately seemingly connected to awareness and trust around SPOT. This is suggested by the strong demand for AMPL staking in the vault and also increasing sophistication in activity in community channels. More people seem to show an understanding of the SPOT system, how it works, and the benefits it brings compared to alternative systems.\n\nThe [FORTH/WETH PALM vault](https://dune.com/arrakis_finance/palm-mainnet?vault_tf7a34=0xe2cbdbc298d884a2ded6b554702f514ed3364264\\&vaultName_e48fe2=selection+by+address\\&vaultName_ea83cf=FORTH-WETH+%28Ethereum%29) is making good use of the market volatility and is showing some life. It’s earned $19K in fees and now owns 65.5 ETH in external assets. The value is up 8% vs holding the assets outside the vault.\n\nThe DAO still owns $1M of AMPL/ETH liquidity on Uniswap v2. Average volume [has been in the few $100k per day](https://v2.info.uniswap.org/pair/0xc5be99a02c6857f9eac67bbce58df5572498f40c), which is a healthy source of income.\n\nThe [SPOT/USDC Arrakis vault](https://beta.arrakis.finance/vaults/0xdf367477c5e596af88e8797c3cde8e28854cb79c?name=spot\\&sortDirection=desc\\&sort=tvl) is earning 1.58% APR from organic fees, all while 77% of the assets are already inflation resistant, which would mean ~5% already vs the dollar.\n\nA new version of the rotation vault is in development, with some features that could help make market making operations for SPOT more efficient, and earn more fees for vault depositors simultaneously.\n\nBut, there is still a lot of work needed to grow SPOT. For SPOT to succeed, I believe we still need more people to treat it as a real and lasting store of value. Higher supportable supply, higher holders of SPOT or SPOT liquidity, more efficient market arbitrage, and perhaps new things to do with SPOT, could help bring SPOT to the next level.\n\n# Proposed Configuration\n\nI propose keeping largely the same configuration as last time with more weight to encouraging SPOT supply and liquidity.\n\nThe rotation vault has shown strong demand so far. We should closely watch the behavior of vault stakers during any possible market reversal.\n\nThe Forth DAO [Treasury](https://etherscan.io/address/0x223592a191ecfc7fdc38a9256c3bd96e771539a9) owns 3,665,664 FORTH directly and 134,595 FORTH in the [Arrakis PALM Vault](https://dune.com/arrakis_finance/palm-mainnet?vaultName_e48fe2=selection+by+address\\&vault_tf7a34=0xe2cbdbc298d884a2ded6b554702f514ed3364264)\n\nProposed Configuration:\n\nGeyser\tPlatform\tPair\tChain\tFORTH Amount\n\nBeehive v5\tUniswap v2\tETH/AMPL\tEthereum\t25,000 FORTH\n\nFly\tUniswap v3\tSPOT/USDC\tEthereum\t25,000 FORTH\n\nTotal\t\t\t\t50,000 FORTH",

      "content": "The current wave of geysers are set to expire on December 19th, 2023, let's talk about the next rounds!\n\n# Ecosystem State\nSPOT is closing in on it's 1 year anniversary next month. It's so far shown resilience through a fairly protracted down market period. The Spot Rotation Vault (aka stAMPL) was [launched 3 months ago](https://blog.ampleforth.org/the-spot-rotation-vault-4f1e9e7d408b) and in that short time has already amassed [6.5% of the AMPL network](https://app.spot.cash/vault).\n\nAMPL has seen some growth lately seemingly connected to awareness and trust around SPOT. This is suggested by the strong demand for AMPL staking in the vault and also increasing sophistication in activity in community channels. More people seem to show an understanding of the SPOT system, how it works, and the benefits it brings compared to alternative systems.\n\nThe [FORTH/WETH PALM vault](https://dune.com/arrakis_finance/palm-mainnet?vault_tf7a34=0xe2cbdbc298d884a2ded6b554702f514ed3364264&vaultName_e48fe2=selection+by+address&vaultName_ea83cf=FORTH-WETH+%28Ethereum%29) is making good use of the market volatility and is showing some life. It's earned $19K in fees and now owns 65.5 ETH in external assets. The value is up 8% vs holding the assets outside the vault.\n\nThe DAO still owns $1M of AMPL/ETH liquidity on Uniswap v2. Average volume [has been in the few $100k per day](https://v2.info.uniswap.org/pair/0xc5be99a02c6857f9eac67bbce58df5572498f40c), which is a healthy source of income.\n\nThe [SPOT/USDC Arrakis vault](https://beta.arrakis.finance/vaults/0xdf367477c5e596af88e8797c3cde8e28854cb79c?name=spot&sortDirection=desc&sort=tvl) is earning 1.58% APR from organic fees, all while 77% of the assets are already inflation resistant, which would mean ~5% already vs the dollar. \n\nA new version of the rotation vault is in development, with some features that could help make market making operations for SPOT more efficient, and earn more fees for vault depositors simultaneously.\n\nBut, there is still a lot of work needed to grow SPOT. For SPOT to succeed, I believe we still need more people to treat it as a real and lasting store of value. Higher supportable supply, higher holders of SPOT or SPOT liquidity, more efficient market arbitrage, and perhaps new things to do with SPOT, could help bring SPOT to the next level.\n\n# Proposed Configuration\n\nI propose keeping largely the same configuration as last time with more weight to encouraging SPOT supply and liquidity.\n\nThe rotation vault has shown strong demand so far. We should closely watch the behavior of vault stakers during any possible market reversal.\n\nThe Forth DAO [Treasury](https://etherscan.io/address/0x223592a191ecfc7fdc38a9256c3bd96e771539a9) owns 3,665,664 FORTH directly and 134,595 FORTH in the [Arrakis PALM Vault](https://dune.com/arrakis_finance/palm-mainnet?vaultName_e48fe2=selection+by+address&vault_tf7a34=0xe2cbdbc298d884a2ded6b554702f514ed3364264)\n\nProposed Configuration:\n|Geyser| Platform | Pair | Chain | FORTH Amount |\n|-|-|-|-|-:|\n| Beehive v5 | Uniswap v2 | ETH/AMPL | Ethereum | 25,000 FORTH|\n| Fly | Uniswap v3 | SPOT/USDC | Ethereum | 25,000 FORTH|\n|Total |||| 50,000 FORTH|",

      "content": "[Governance Forum Discussion](https://forum.ampleforth.org/t/proposal-to-generalize-cpi-oracle-correct-for-bea-data-revision/)\n\n# Background\n\nThe Ampleforth protocol produces AMPL, a decentralized and durable digital currency, much like Bitcoin, but with a Unit of Account. AMPL's unit is designed to be long-term stable, independent even of the movement of fiat currencies.\n\nTo calculate the AMPL price target denominated in dollars, the protocol Policy contract consumes the [Personal Consumption Expenditures](https://www.bea.gov/data/personal-consumption-expenditures-price-index)(PCE) as a measure of prices paid by consumers. There is no particular tie to the PCE as a data source specifically. Meaning, there is no “peg” to CPI, inflation, or PCE. PCE is simply used as one measuring stick to ensure constant unit value of AMPL through time.\n\nWhen AMPL was launched in July of 2019, the PCE value was 109.195. Later PCE values are compared against this base value to produce a % price inflation since inception. For example:\n\n> Last month, a PCE value of 127.177 produced a price target of (127.177 / 109.195) = $1.16\n\nYou can view the history of the price feed and protocol operation on the [Ampleforth dashboard](https://www.ampleforth.org/dashboard).\n\n# The BEA & Data Revision\n\nPCE data is produced by the Bureau of Economic Analysis and updated monthly. One important aspect of the BEA is **it may sometimes revise previously published data**. We have seen a number of these revisions over time, but so far they've been small and over relatively recent data periods. However, last month there was a comprehensive revision going back to before the Ampleforth protocol was launched 4 years ago.\n\nIn addition to any other data changes, all values over this time span were *scaled down*:\n\n> The PCE in July 2019 when AMPL launched was 109.195\n\n> The recorded PCE for July 2019 today is now 103.422\n\nThis means that the protocol is calculating a price target of (120.550 / 109.195) = $1.10\n\nrather than the more correct (120.550 / 103.422) = $1.16\n\n# Proposed Changes\n\n1) Remove the [baseCpi](https://github.com/ampleforth/ampleforth-contracts/blob/113254b4f6f6f69910c73654ac84eb796cb5857e/contracts/UFragmentsPolicy.sol#L50) constant from the Ampleforth Policy Contract\n\n2) Add a more generalized scaling factor into the CPI oracle Medianizer, and have this be configurable through governance\nEssentially, the Policy should not be concerned with how data sources change or evolve. The policy contract will simply consume the dollar-denominated price target directly. These CPI formatting details are better encapsulated within the CPI oracle itself, which is further on the protocol's periphery. This lets us more easily enshrine the core Policy contract behavior going forward by insulating it from future oracle changes.\n\n3) Update the new scaling factor to be inline with the revised data\n\n4) Continue exploring alternative data sources which do not revise past data. This removes the potential impacts of future revisions and reduces the need for governance intervention.\n\n# Implementation\n\n- [Code Changes](https://github.com/ampleforth/ampleforth-contracts/compare/06567ad34d99304cb2a34ff07592dd6dc9e08d6e...v1.3)\n- CPI Medianizer Deployment: [0x2A18bfb505b49AED12F19F271cC1183F98ff4f71](https://etherscan.io/address/0x2A18bfb505b49AED12F19F271cC1183F98ff4f71) \n- Policy Implementation Deployment: [0x2C628463de226433820DD479Be27360Deb4592d1](https://etherscan.io/address/0x2c628463de226433820dd479be27360deb4592d1)",

      "title": "Proposal to Seed Liquidity for AMPL-SPOT Pair on Button Swap",
      "content": "# TLDR: Use the FORTH DAO treasury to seed an AMPL-SPOT pool on Button Swap with 25,000 SPOT and 25,000 AMPL.\n\nProposal Actions: Transfer 150,000 AMPL out of the treasury to the community Kennel Club multisig at: eth:0x57981B1EaFe4b18EC97f8B10859B40207b364662\n\nIn order to seed 25,000 AMPL and 25,000 SPOT, you need 25,000 AMPL + (4x) 25,000 AMPL for the SPOT mint. Whatever is left over from the 150,000 will be sent back to the DAO.\n\nAfter receiving support on the forum post and receiving 100% ‘For’ votes on Signal, we now seek approval on Tally to deploy funds on Button Swap.\n\nNote: Since the initial discussion and proposal, Button Swap has rebranded to Poolside. \n\n## Proposal\nThis proposal aligns our shared goals: to increase the utility and liquidity of SPOT, and to support the early growth of Button Swap, a new AMM for rebasing assets.\n\nDAOs generally have two big problems:\n\n1. How to diversify its treasury without putting downward pressure on its own token.\n2. How to put its treasury assets to work and earn.\n\nProviding liquidity on Swap solves the latter as FORTH DAO would earn fees from Swaps.\n\n### Ampleforth x Buttonwood\nAs detailed in the forum, Buttonwood has had close ties with the Ampleforth team for years.\n\n# LPs Earn More on Button Swap vs. Other AMMs\n\nThrough our involvement with AMPL and rebasing assets, we found and created a better solution for AMPL liquidity providers (LPs).\n\nOn other automated market makers (AMMs), rebasing alters the marginal price. This creates several problems:\n\n- For positive rebases, existing AMMs think the asset is getting cheaper.\n- For negative rebases, more expensive.\n- As a result, traders arbitrage tokens from the pool that would otherwise be owned by LPs.\n\n## Button Swap’s Solution\n\nButton Swap doesn’t solve every type of impermanent loss, but it does solve the one described above. The design is similar to Uniswap v2, but introduces a novel innovation, reservoirs:\n\n- Button Swap’s model includes both a liquidity pool and a “reservoir” for each asset.\n- Liquidity pools and reservoirs together form a “pair.”\n- Liquidity pools are the active liquidity that gives users the swap ratio between two unique tokens.\n- Reservoirs hold “excess” tokens, representing inactive liquidity (Note: at least one reservoir is always empty).\n\nWith Button Swap, new tokens flow to the reservoir, rather than liquidity pools. This allows the active pool to maintain the marginal price (1 AMPL = 1 SPOT)\n\n![](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard14/uploads/governance1/original/1X/c2b3960e72b69c65c06d6ca0737af64fa1e07e01.png)\n\nNegative rebases follow the same logic. For a 10% negative rebase to AMPL, each pool would hold 90,000, and the reservoir for SPOT would hold 10,000 SPOT.\n\nThe net result of our design is more money for LPs. With Button Swap, additional token incentives become lucrative rewards, rather than compensating LPs for predictable losses.\n\n## Benefits of the Proposal\n\nTo establish a strong start and incentivize early liquidity providers, we kindly propose that FORTH DAO seed initial liquidity for a new asset pair on Button - Swap: AMPL-SPOT. We think a good starting point would be 25,000 AMPL and 25,000 SPOT.\n\n1. We believe Button Swap has the best design for a AMPL-SPOT pool.\n2. The AMPL-SPOT pair does not exist anywhere else.\n3. The FORTH DAO already owns both of these assets, and will earn fees from this initiative.\n\nIn addition to earning fees on treasury funds, seeding liquidity for the SPOT-AMPL pair is a strategic move that generates additional benefits, including:\n\n1. Enhanced Liquidity: A deep AMPL-SPOT pair will improve price stability and reduce slippage for traders.\n2. Mitigated Impermanent Loss: Button Swap’s unique mechanism to handle rebasing events will result in reduced losses for LPs. This feature should attract even more LPs to this pair, thereby further enhancing its depth and stability.\n3. Introduces New Market Opportunities: A successful AMPL-SPOT pair opens the door for additional rebasing pairs down the road. Pairs could be denominated in SPOT or AMPL. Button Swap can support two rebasing assets as well, so Lido stETH-AMPL would work nicely as well.\n\n### Other Notes\n- Button Swap (now known as Poolside) was audited by StateMind.\n",

      "content": "For the full background and discussion, please see the forum post: [https://forum.ampleforth.org/t/proposal-to-seed-liquidity-for-ampl-spot-pair-on-button-swap/684](url)\n\n# TLDR: Use the FORTH DAO treasury to seed an AMPL-SPOT pool on ButtonSwap with 25,000 SPOT and 25,000 AMPL.\n\nProposal Actions: Transfer 150,000 AMPL out of the treasury to the community Kennel Club multisig at: eth:0x57981B1EaFe4b18EC97f8B10859B40207b364662\n\nIn order to seed 25,000 AMPL and 25,000 SPOT, you need 25,000 AMPL + (4x) 25,000 AMPL for the SPOT mint. Whatever is left over from the 150,000 will be sent back to the DAO.\n\nAfter receiving support on the forum post and receiving 100% ‘For’ votes on Signal, we now seek approval on Tally to deploy funds on Button Swap.\n\n## Proposal\nThis proposal aligns our shared goals: to increase the utility and liquidity of SPOT, and to support the early growth of Button Swap, a new AMM for rebasing assets.\n\nDAOs generally have two big problems:\n\n1. How to diversify its treasury without putting downward pressure on its own token\n2. How to put its treasury assets to work and earn\n\nProviding liquidity on Swap solves the latter as FORTH DAO would earn fees from swaps.\n\n### Ampleforth x Buttonwood\nAs detailed in the forum, Buttonwood has had close ties with the Ampleforth team for years.\n\n### LPs Earn More on Button Swap vs. Other AMMs\n\nThrough our involvement with AMPL and rebasing assets, we found and created a better solution for AMPL liquidity providers (LPs).\n\nOn other automated market makers (AMMs), rebasing alters the marginal price. This creates several problems:\n \n- For positive rebases, existing AMMs think the asset is getting cheaper.\n- For negative rebases, more expensive.\n- As a result, traders arbitrage tokens from the pool that would otherwise be owned by LPs.\n\n## Button Swap’s Solution\n\nButton Swap doesn’t solve every type of impermanent loss, but it does solve the one described above. The design is similar to Uniswap v2, but introduces a novel innovation, reservoirs:\n\n- Button Swap’s model includes both a liquidity pool and a “reservoir” for each asset.\n- Liquidity pools and reservoirs together form a “pair.”\n- Liquidity pools are the active liquidity that gives users the swap ratio between two unique tokens.\n- Reservoirs hold “excess” tokens, representing inactive liquidity (Note: at least one reservoir is always empty).\n\nWith Button Swap, new tokens flow to the reservoir, rather than liquidity pools. This allows the active pool to maintain the marginal price (1 AMPL = 1 SPOT).\n\n![](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard14/uploads/governance1/original/1X/c2b3960e72b69c65c06d6ca0737af64fa1e07e01.png)\n\nNegative rebases follow the same logic. For a 10% negative rebase to AMPL, each pool would hold 90,000, and the reservoir for SPOT would hold 10,000 SPOT.\n\nThe net result of our design is more money for LPs. With Button Swap, additional token incentives become lucrative rewards, rather than compensating LPs for predictable losses.\n\n## Benefits of the Proposal\n\nTo establish a strong start and incentivize early liquidity providers, we kindly propose that FORTH DAO seed initial liquidity for a new asset pair on Button - Swap: AMPL-SPOT. We think a good starting point would be 25,000 AMPL and 25,000 SPOT.\n\n1. We believe Button Swap has the best design for a AMPL-SPOT pool\n2. The AMPL-SPOT pair does not exist anywhere else\n3. The FORTH DAO already owns both of these assets, and will earn fees from this initiative\n\nIn addition to earning fees on treasury funds, seeding liquidity for the SPOT-AMPL pair is a strategic move that generates additional benefits, including:\n\n1. Enhanced Liquidity: A deep AMPL-SPOT pair will improve price stability and reduce slippage for traders.\n2. Mitigated Impermanent Loss: Button Swap’s unique mechanism to handle rebasing events will result in reduced losses for LPs. This feature should attract even more LPs to this pair, thereby further enhancing its depth and stability.\n3. Introduces New Market Opportunities: A successful AMPL-SPOT pair opens the door for additional rebasing pairs down the road. Pairs could be denominated in SPOT or AMPL. Button Swap can support two rebasing assets as well, so Lido stETH-AMPL would work nicely as well.\n\n### Additional Notes:\nSince the initial proposal, Button Swap has rebranded to Poolside. The DEX will shift from app.swap.button.finance to app.poolside.party\nThe Button Swap protocol was audited by StateMind",

      "title": "Geyser Refresh for Q3 2023",
      "content": "The current geyser programs are ending soon, let's talk about the next rounds!\n\n# About the Geysers\n\nThe [Geyser](https://geyser.ampleforth.org/) program was created as a way to distribute AMPL out into the world in a sensible, permissionless, and predictable way. It did this by directing to those who contributed to the health of the AMPL ecosystem by providing liquidity on DEXs.\n\nYou can learn more [here](https://forum.ampleforth.org/t/about-the-geyser/70). However, it's always been within the DAO's control to change or modify this program as it sees fit to keep up with the evolution of the marketplace.\n\n# History and Future\n\nThe first geyser was launched in the Summer of 2020. At the time, AMPL was a young project. One of the big issues then was the question of how AMPL could achieve broad and diverse distribution. However, considerable time has passed since then, and the project has matured in many ways.\n\nDeFi Summer saw an influx of attention and new users. AMPL is now tradable on exchanges like Coinbase, KuCoin, Bitfinex, and others, in addition to various decentralization exchanges. FORTH governance is live, along with an associated treasury under its control. The Spot flatcoin is a promising future demand sink for AMPL and has the potential to reach an even larger audience because the value proposition is easier to understand and appreciate.\n\nNow that SPOT is moving from a \"soft-launched\" phase to a \"launched\" phase, it's a good time to revisit the Geyser configurations and ensure they're doing as much as possible for the success of the ecosystem. There has been a general consensus building that a small number of deep pools, combined with liquidity owned directly by the DAO is the best direction to move toward long term.\n\nAMPL is, at its core, a scarce commodity. In order for the DAO to own liquidity, mint SPOT, support Spot rotations via the rotation vault, or support the ecosystem in currently unforeseen ways, it will need to maintain a sizable enough portion of AMPL to perform these duties. I don't think the original goal for the ecosystem fund to give out all the AMPL into the market continues to matches the needs of the ecosystem today and going forward. Instead, I propose shifting the geyser reward token to FORTH.\n\nIt makes sense for those who are supporting the health of the ecosystem to continue to get a stake in its governance. Allocating FORTH for liquidity providers can help deepen community ownership and increase governance among the most active stakeholders.\n\nAlso, it’s worth mentioning that, for those who still value single-sided AMPL staking, this is now available in the recently rolled out >> [Rotation Vault](https://app.spot.cash/vault) <<!\n\n# Proposed Configuration\n\nThe Forth DAO [Treasury](https://etherscan.io/address/0x223592a191ecfc7fdc38a9256c3bd96e771539a9) owns 3,715,664 FORTH directly and 147,928 FORTH in the [Arrakis PALM Vault](https://dune.com/arrakis_finance/palm-mainnet?vaultName_e48fe2=selection+by+address&vault_tf7a34=0xe2cbdbc298d884a2ded6b554702f514ed3364264)\n\nI propose moving from 3 month cycles to 4 month cycles to minimize governance overhead. If we imagine devoting half of a hypothetical 2% inflation to geyser rewards for a year, then that would equate to 50K forth for this four month period. This could be broken down as follows:\n\n|Geyser| Platform | Pair | Chain | FORTH Amount |\n|-|-|-|-|-:|\n| Beehive v5 | Uniswap v2 | ETH/AMPL | Ethereum | 35,000 FORTH|\n| Fly | Uniswap v3 | SPOT/USDC | Ethereum | 15,000 FORTH|\n|Total |||| 50,000 FORTH|",

      "title": "Proposal to Seed Liquidity for AMPL-SPOT Pair on Button Swap",
      "content": "For the full background and discussion, please see the forum post.\n\nTLDR: Use the FORTH DAO treasury to seed an AMPL-SPOT pool on ButtonSwap with 25,000 SPOT and 25,000 AMPL.\n\nAfter getting strong positive support on the forum post, I am moving this proposal to snapshot. This proposal aligns our shared goals: to increase the utility and liquidity of SPOT, and to support the early growth of Button Swap, a new AMM for rebasing assets.\n\nThis proposal aligns our shared goals: to increase the utility and liquidity of SPOT, and to support the early growth of Button Swap, a new AMM for rebasing assets.\n\nDAOs generally have two big problems:\n1. How to diversify its treasury without putting downward pressure on its own token\n2. How to put its treasury assets to work and earn\n\nProviding liquidity on Swap solves the latter as FORTH DAO would earn fees from Swaps \n\nAmpleforth x Buttonwood\nAlthough new to this forum, Buttonwood has been closely tied to and aligned with the Ampleforth team for years:\n\nLPs Earn More on Button Swap vs. Other AMMs\nThrough our involvement with AMPL and rebasing assets, we found and created a better solution for AMPL liquidity providers (LPs).\n\nOn other automated market makers (AMMs), rebasing alters the marginal price. This creates several problems:\n- For positive rebases, existing AMMs think the asset is getting cheaper.\n- For negative rebases, more expensive.\n- As a result, traders arbitrage tokens from the pool that would otherwise be owned by LPs.\n\nButton Swap’s Solution\nButton Swap doesn’t solve every type of impermanent loss, but it does solve the one described above. The design is similar to Uniswap v2, but introduces a novel innovation, reservoirs:\n\n- Button Swap’s model includes both a liquidity pool and a “reservoir” for each asset.\n- Liquidity pools and reservoirs together form a “pair.”\n- Liquidity pools are the active liquidity that gives users the swap ratio between two unique tokens.\n- Reservoirs hold “excess” tokens, representing inactive liquidity (Note: at least one reservoir is always empty).\n\nWith Button Swap, new tokens flow to the reservoir, rather than liquidity pools. This allows the active pool to maintain the marginal price (1 AMPL = 1 SPOT)  ![c2b3960e72b69c65c06d6ca0737af64fa1e07e01.png](ipfs://bafkreiggvwmkvhhtqph73xyjacafy2rq3a7fgstsj63fbeoyn4e3deqfke)\n\nNegative rebases follow the same logic. For a 10% negative rebase to AMPL, each pool would hold 90,000, and the reservoir for SPOT would hold 10,000 SPOT.\n\nThe net result of our design is more money for LPs. With Button Swap, additional token incentives become lucrative rewards, rather than compensating LPs for predictable losses.\n\nProposal\nTo establish a strong start and incentivize early liquidity providers, we kindly propose that FORTH DAO seed initial liquidity for a new asset pair on Button - Swap: AMPL-SPOT. We think a good starting point would be 25,000 AMPL and 25,000 SPOT.\n\n- We believe Button Swap has the best design for a AMPL-SPOT pool\n- The AMPL-SPOT pair does not exist anywhere else\n- The FORTH DAO already owns both of these assets, and will earn fees from this initiative\n\nIn addition to earning fees on treasury funds, seeding liquidity for the SPOT-AMPL pair is a strategic move that generates additional benefits, including:\n\n1. Enhanced Liquidity: A deep AMPL-SPOT pair will improve price stability and reduce slippage for traders.\n\n2. Mitigated Impermanent Loss: Button Swap’s unique mechanism to handle rebasing events will result in reduced losses for LPs. This feature should attract even more LPs to this pair, thereby further enhancing its depth and stability.\n\n3. Introduces New Market Opportunities: A successful AMPL-SPOT pair opens the door for additional rebasing pairs down the road. Pairs could be denominated in SPOT or AMPL. Button Swap can support two rebasing assets as well, so Lido stETH-AMPL would work nicely as well.\n\n- Note: Button Swap’s value proposition for rebasing assets also applies to reward-bearing assets. A Rocketpool rETH-AMPL or rETH-SPOT would be another example.",

      "title": "Proposal - Chainlink CPI Architecture Upgrade",
      "content": "Summary\n\nThis proposal is to upgrade the CPI oracle used by Ampleforth to the latest version of Chainlink’s decentralized oracle network infrastructure and automation solution for the monthly on-chain delivery of the consumer price index.\n\nRationale\n\nAmpleforth was one of the first protocols that integrated Chainlink oracles back in 2019, providing access to the AMPL price and CPI metric data. The infrastructure delivering CPI data currently uses the same architecture developed at the feed’s inception. Since that time, key improvements in security, reliability, availability, and data quality have been made to Chainlink’s decentralized oracle networks.\n\nThis proposal would upgrade the data delivery mechanism to Chainlink’s current infrastructure to take advantage of these improvements to deliver CPI data used as the price target. The push method for data delivery will remain the same; a Chainlink oracle network would perform a monthly push of the CPI metric to the Ampleforth contract during Ampleforth’s specific time window. Chainlink Automation, a decentralized automation solution, would ensure the monthly push of the CPI metric to the Ampleforth contract.\n\nThe new architecture includes two new automation jobs that will run monthly:\n\n- A new automation job requests a new round on the OCR feed on the first day of every month at 19:00 UTC.\n- A second automation job watches the CPI data feed proxy for new oracle reports, then writes the CPI metric update to Ampleforth’s MedianOracle contract once detected.\n\nChainlink Automation requires a small fee for transactions on-chain. The two automation jobs use a combined approximately 375K of gas monthly (+/-10k gas). Chainlink Labs will kick off the new proposal by funding approximately the first three months of expected fees. After this initial period, the FORTH DAO would be responsible for maintaining the automation jobs and keeping the account funded.\n\nUpon approval of this proposal, on-chain actions would initiate to remove the old provider address 0xA1FfB3cB206495eE3fE64E4Ee1A9567da220486E from the Medianizer (MedianOracle | Address 0xa759F960dD59A1aD32c995ecabE802a0C35F244F | Etherscan) and add the new provider address 0xab8b9bE60dfAb76FD16621c296B21C61fBf63E91.\n\nWith this proposal, the Ampleforth Protocol can receive the following benefits, each offered “as is” without representations, guarantees, or warranties of any kind, on a commercially feasible basis and subject to the FORTH DAO’s acceptance of the Chainlink Labs service terms (available at Terms of Use – Chainlink Labs):\n\n- Automation Networks: Maintenance and support for the current and future Chainlink Automation upkeeps that are integrated to support Ampleforth’s products.\n- Network Monitoring: Monitoring and management of the Automation networks that are used by Ampleforth. This includes rapid response support, incident response, and a dedicated communication channel.\nThe benefits are solely being made available to the Ampleforth Protocol and not to any other party, including the FORTH DAO.\n\nThese changes are required to ensure the continued reliability and availability of CPI metric data. This proposal follows alongside the previously approved migration of the AMPL Price Feed 1 to the upgraded Chainlink infrastructure.\n\nFor more detail and provide feedback, please see the governance forum post: https://forum.ampleforth.org/t/proposal-chainlink-cpi-architecture-upgrade/657",

It is also used as a way to tokenize LP positions so the geyser program can work with Uniswap V3. This vault currently holds > 40% of the [SPOT/USDC liquidity pool](https://info.uniswap.org/#/pools/0x7e0c73af898e1ad50a8efd7d3a678c23cd90b74c) on Uniswap.\n\n**Arrakis PALM**, Protocol Automated Liquidity Management, is a liquidity bootstrapping mechanism that taps into the organic trading volume on UniV3.\n\nPALM is designed to bootstrap liquidity by acquiring more base asset inventory. For instance, the Forth DAO can seed liquidity with an initial asset ratio of 90/10 in FORTH/ETH. PALM can progressively balance it towards a target ratio, like 50/50, only by taking advantage of the volatility to make markets for FORTH. Not only will this approach save the DAO Treasury from spending ETH on liquidity and FORTH/AMPL/SPOT on LP incentives, but it will also put no downward pressure on FORTH price since the market-making is done via setting up LP positions instead of doing swaps.\n\nDuring the time of deployment, the Forth DAO community would have full transparency of the execution and performance of PALM via a custom dashboard, and it retains full custody of the liquidity in the vault. At any point in time, the DAO could withdraw the fund from the vault or revoke the managing access from PALM. PALM can only conduct market-making with the liquidity deposited in the vault, and will never be able to remove the fund.\n\nA case study of Arrakis' first PALM deployment for Gelato's GEL token showed [very good results](https://twitter.com/ArrakisFinance/status/1623319923559636994), accumulating from 2 ETH to nearly 170 ETH in under 3 months.\n\nArrakis charges two fees:\n\n* Management fee: 1% AUM fee on a yearly basis\n\n* Performance fee: 50% of trading fees generated\n\nRead more at--\n\nWebsite: https://www.arrakis.finance/\n\nDocs: https://resources.arrakis.fi/\n\n# Current State of FORTH Liquidity\n\nFORTH is listed on a variety of [Tier-1 centralized exchanges](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ampleforth-governance-token#markets) like Binance, Coinbase, Kucoin, Kraken and does in excess of $5M of daily volume. Despite this, there is no meaningful FORTH liquidity onchain. Creating a pool onchain would allow the DAO to tap into the already decent volume in the surrounding ecosystem.\n\nThe Forth DAO Treasury [currently owns](https://www.ampleforth.org/dashboard/dao) 3.8M idle FORTH tokens. Deploying some of these into PALM would simultaneously support the ecosystem by providing liquidity and also safely diversity the treasury over time.\n\n# Proposed Phase 1 Deployment\n\nThe DAO also holds $1.14M of AMPL/ETH liquidity on Uniswap V2, which includes ~552 ETH (~$595K). We could utilize 10% of the ETH in the AMPL/ETH pool to initialize the FORTH PALM vault in a 90:10 FORTH/ETH configuration.\n\nThat would initialize PALM with approximately:\n\n* $540K in FORTH and\n\n* $60K in ETH\n\ntotaling ~$600K to start.\n\nSince PALM is a new system, an option to minimize risk is to start with $200K of assets, then reserve a follow on with the remaining $400K after a period of observation--perhaps after 1 quarter.\n\n# Phase 2\n\nAfter 50:50 equilibrium is reached, the DAO can revisit market making objectives. Since PALM is non-custodial and exists onchain, the DAO retains ownership of the assets and is free to withdraw them at any time. At this point, we can revisit if/how to adjust the parameters, or if/how much liquidity should be added or removed.\n\nFor example, the DAO could maintain the vault as is, repurpose the accumulated ETH and deepen AMPL or SPOT liquidity, or deploy the ETH for yield completely independently.",

Despite this, there is no meaningful FORTH liquidity onchain. Creating a pool onchain would allow the DAO to tap into the already decent volume in the surrounding ecosystem.\n\nThe Forth DAO Treasury [currently owns](https://www.ampleforth.org/dashboard/dao) 3.8M idle FORTH tokens. Deploying some of these into PALM would simultaneously support the ecosystem by providing liquidity and also safely diversity the treasury over time.\n\n# Proposed Phase 1 Deployment\n\nThe DAO also holds $1.14M of AMPL/ETH liquidity on Uniswap V2, which includes ~552 ETH (~$595K). We could utilize 10% of the ETH in the AMPL/ETH pool to initialize the FORTH PALM vault in a 90:10 FORTH/ETH configuration.\n\nThat would initialize PALM with approximately:\n\n* $540K in FORTH and\n\n* $60K in ETH\n\ntotaling ~$600K to start.\n\nSince PALM is a new system, an option to minimize risk is to start with $200K of assets, then reserve a follow on with the remaining $400K after a period of observation--perhaps after 1 quarter.\n\n# Phase 2\n\nAfter 50:50 equilibrium is reached, the DAO can revisit market making objectives. Since PALM is non-custodial and exists onchain, the DAO retains ownership of the assets and is free to withdraw them at any time. At this point, we can revisit if/how to adjust the parameters, or if/how much liquidity should be added or removed.\n\nFor example, the DAO could maintain the vault as is, repurpose the accumulated ETH and deepen AMPL or SPOT liquidity, or deploy the ETH for yield completely independently.",

      "title": "Chainlink Pricefeed Migration",
      "content": "Summary\n\nThis proposal is to upgrade the AMPL price feed to Chainlink’s latest decentralized oracle network and automation solution for daily delivery of on-chain price updates.\n\nRationale\n\nAmpleforth is one of the first consumers of Chainlink pricefeeds starting in 2019. The infrastructure delivering this data uses the same architecture developed at the feed’s inception. Since that time, key improvements in security, reliability, availability, and data quality have been made to decentralized oracle networks. This proposal would upgrade the data delivery mechanism to Chainlink’s current infrastructure to take advantage of these improvements to deliver the AMPL price. The push method for data delivery will remain the same; the Chainlink Decentralized Oracle Network would perform a daily push of the AMPL price to the Ampleforth contract during Ampleforth’s specific time window. Chainlink Automation 1, a fully decentralized automation solution, will ensure the daily push of the AMPL price to the Ampleforth contract.\n\nThe new architecture includes two new automation jobs that will run daily:\n\nA new automation job requests a new round on the OCR feed every day at 00:10 UTC.\nA second automation job watches the proxy for price changes, then writes the price update to Ampleforth’s MedianOracle contract once detected.\nChainlink Automation requires a small fee for transactions on-chain. The two automation jobs use a combined 375K of gas daily. Chainlink Labs will kick off the new proposal by funding approximately the first three months of expected fees. After this initial period, the FORTH Dao would be responsible for maintaining the automation jobs and keeping the account funded.\n\nUpon approval of this proposal, on-chain actions would initiate to remove the old provider address 0xfc4b1Ce32ed7310028DCC0d94C7B3D96dCd880e0 from the Medianizer (MedianOracle | Address 0x99c9775e076fdf99388c029550155032ba2d8914 | Etherscan) and add the new provider address 0xd95AE80B3117Fd410d276F7C276d31B2cbFf773D.\n\nThese changes are required to ensure the continued reliability and availability of the AMPL price feed. A follow-up proposal will be submitted to migrate the monthly CPI feed to the same infrastructure.\n\nFor more detail and provide feedback, please see the governance forum post: https://forum.ampleforth.org/t/proposal-chainlink-pricefeed-migration/621",

      "title": "ElasticSwap SPOT-AMPL Proposal ",
      "content": "Given the positive feedback from the Forth DAO community to the discussion on the Ampleforth Forum regarding the Forth DAO seeding a SPOT-AMPL pool on \nElasticSwap, we want to move this to a Snapshot vote. \n\nhttps://forum.ampleforth.org/t/forthdao-spot-ampl-pool-on-elasticswap/591\n\nSummary:\n\nThis is a proposal for the Forth DAO to seed liquidity for a SPOT-AMPL pool on ElasticSwap.\n\nAbstract:\n\nWith the launch of SPOT, the Forth DAO would mint SPOT using AMPL in the treasury, pair that SPOT with additional AMPL in the treasury, and seed an SPOT-AMPL pool on ElasticSwap. The amount to be seeded is subject to any limitations on the initial supply of SPOT, but the DAO will target an initial pool $1M deep ($500k SPOT and $500k AMPL). The deeper the pool the more efficient the pair will trade.\n\nThis proposal allows for the Forth DAO to have that additional SPOT liquidity while maintaining its AMPL exposure, allowing the treasury to diversify its treasury and grow the ecosystem, while also increasing the total capital the DAO treasury controls. Furthermore, the Forth DAO will generate 25 bps in fees for the liquidity they are providing, so this will provide a nice stream of revenue for the DAO.\n\nMotivation:\n\nElasticSwap is the first AMM that specializes in dealing with elastic-supply tokens, getting rid of impermanent loss as a result of the rebase. ElasticSwap is a partner of the Ampleforth ecosystem and has been operating pools on both Avalanche and Mainnet since April/May 2022, and is therefore a logical starting place for the initial pool.\n\nThe Forth DAO currently has FORTH, AMPL, and LP positions from various pools in the treasury. It is logical that the DAO mint SPOT as a way to diversify the treasury and deepen the amount of available SPOT but rather than just holding that SPOT in the treasury, the DAO could use that SPOT and some additional AMPL to bring liquidity to SPOT, provide a deep pool of initial liquidity, and put the assets to work via an LP position.\n\nElasticSwap is committed to supporting the Ampleforth ecosystem and will integrate SPOT into the frontend from day 1.\n",

This makes it hard to submit proposals and only very few individuals with enough voting power can submit. While this is good for security it is bad for decentralization and inclusion of the community.\n\n## Solution\nLower the proposal threshold to 25k FORTH (about $95k USD at time of writing). This will allow for a smaller group of community members with enough stake to make a proposal without requiring a team member or mega Forth whale to submit the proposal. Quorum will still stay at 600k FORTH\n\n## Risks\nSpam - with a lower threshold we invite more potential proposal spam and could reduce the quality of proposals. However with 20k Forth I think we strike a balance between difficultly to propose and enabling more independent proposal submissions Gas - more proposals mean more gas spend required for on chain proposals. Delegation is a good way to work around this problem. Again with the right balance they should still be high quality proposals that Forth holders would want to vote on Governance attacks - this doesn’t really increase the threat of gov attacks because in order for the attacker to get the vote to pass they still have to get enough Forth for a quorum.\n\nThe current proposed number of 25k Forth was based on the USD value of the time of the poll in the forum post [here](https://forum.ampleforth.org/t/lower-proposal-submit-threshold-for-on-chain-voting/445/10?u=kbambridge). \n\n## UPDATE\nA hardcoded minimum of 75K Forth set for a proposal threshold in the contract code currently. For now this proposal will set the threshold to the theoretical minimum of 75,000 Forth, but in the future if an upgrade to lower the minimum in the governance contract is approved we can set it closer to the community target between 15-35K.\n\n[Link to Source Code](https://github.com/ampleforth/Forth/blob/e8498423870a6698e8f06a2a74a04f298f1aab82/contracts/GovernorBravoDelegate.sol#L13-L14)\n\nThanks for participating in this vote and engaging with Forth DAO governance.

      "title": "Set Proposal Threshold to 75k (current contract minimum)",
      "content": "From the snapshot vote:\n\n---\n\n## Problem\n\nTo submit on chain proposals for voting on Tally, the current threshold is 150k Forth, which is currently over half a million USD. This makes it hard to submit proposals and only very few individuals with enough voting power can submit. While this is good for security it is bad for decentralization and inclusion of the community.\n\n## Solution\n\nLower the proposal threshold to 25k FORTH (about $95k USD at time of writing). This will allow for a smaller group of community members with enough stake to make a proposal without requiring a team member or mega Forth whale to submit the proposal. Quorum will still stay at 600k FORTH\n\n## Risks\n\nSpam - with a lower threshold we invite more potential proposal spam and could reduce the quality of proposals. However with 20k Forth I think we strike a balance between difficultly to propose and enabling more independent proposal submissions\nGas - more proposals mean more gas spend required for on chain proposals. Delegation is a good way to work around this problem. Again with the right balance they should still be high quality proposals that Forth holders would want to vote on\nGovernance attacks - this doesn’t really increase the threat of gov attacks because in order for the attacker to get the vote to pass they still have to get enough Forth for a quorum.\n\nThe current proposed number of 25k Forth was based on the USD value of the time of the poll in the forum post here: https://forum.ampleforth.org/t/lower-proposal-submit-threshold-for-on-chain-voting/445/10?u=kbambridge\n\n## **UPDATE**\n\nBrandon found and I verified that there is a hardcoded minimum of **75K Forth** set for a proposal threshold in the contract code currently. For now this proposal will set the threshold to the theoretical minimum of 75,000 Forth, but in the future if an upgrade to lower the minimum in the governance contract is approved we can set it closer  to the community target between 15-35K.\n\n[Link to Source Code](https://github.com/ampleforth/Forth/blob/e8498423870a6698e8f06a2a74a04f298f1aab82/contracts/GovernorBravoDelegate.sol#L13-L14)\n\n---\n\nThanks for participating in this vote and engaging with Forth DAO governance. The goal of this proposal is to get more engagement from the community in Forth DAO and allow good ideas to get to the point of being proposed on chain without adding much risk or friction.",

      "title": "[Update] FGP: FORTH Community Grants Program",
      "content": "Abstract\nHourglass’s recent grant proposal has raised the necessary, and pertinent, topic of forming a community-operated FORTH Grants program. Continuing to use HourGlass’s proposal as precedent, all ideas - in the form of a formal proposal - should be submitted by FORTH’s community and further deliberated upon by the encompassing community members.\n\nFGP Rationale\nUpdate (May 19, 2022):\n\nCurrent FORTH DAO Treasury Market Value: $22.036m (24.251m AMPL)\nScreen Shot 2022-05-19 at 2.31.42 PM\nScreen Shot 2022-05-19 at 2.31.42 PM\n1576×1324 108 KB\nAt the time of writing (April 5th, 2022), the FORTHClaim contract holds ~3,558,156 $FORTH (current USD market value: $27,682,460.06). Upon April 16th, these unclaimed $FORTH tokens will be repossessed and transferred to the FORTH DAO treasury. Taking this into consideration concurrently with Brandon’s proposal to execute first FORTH mint (which would further fund the FORTH DAO treasury with 300,000 FORTH tokens - worth $2,334,000 at today’s market value) the FORTH DAO would kick off operations with a healthy treasury worth 3,858,156 FORTH ($30,016,453.68)!\n\nProposal\nUpdated (May 19, 2022):\n\nInspired by precedent-settings forerunning initiatives such as Compound, Uniswap, and Aave Grants Program it is imperative that FORTH DAO follows suit to incentivize, reward, and often interrogate current Ampleforth mechanisms/systems/features that would largely improve the experience for all community participants.\n\nAs an experimental phase, it is proposed to initiate & monitor a pilot program that will run for 2 fiscal quarters (6 months total). A max grants budget of $1.5M (433,526.0116 FORTH) is requested - relative to the size of the FORTH DAO treasury we believe this is a reasonable amount to initiate an MVP product (program). Upon the completion of this experimental phase, a subsequent proposal will be submitted to gauge community sentiment regarding the continuation of the program.\n\nIt is also proposed that a small operating committee is formed consisting of 6 members: 1 Lead and 5 Reviewers in an effort to mobilize and exhibit an efficient, transparent, and methodical application review process. For a well balanced committee, it is proposed that at least one core team member holds a reviewer role. It is intended to keep the committee to 6 members as it will enable judicious feedback loops and immediate iteration(s). The FORTH Grant Committee (FGC) will have the ability to administer grants on a discretionary basis based on the following criteria:\n\nSwift Grants: <$100,000\nStraightforward & Simple application process that is assessed by the FGC.\nFGC decision is to be made within 10 days after receiving the application.\nCommunity Grants: $100,000 - $500,000\nApplicants must post their proposal on FORTH’s governance forum.\n\nBased on the feedback given by the community, the committee will decide whether or not to approve these grants.\n\nFunds will be released based on deliverables (‘Gates’). Upon successful deployment of each Gate, % of the grant’s funding will be released to the grantee.\n\nAt the conclusion of the final ‘Gate’, the entirety of the grant’s funds should be allocated to the grantee - based on deliverables.\n\nIt is worth noting that applicants can seek grants that exceed $500,000, however these proposals will not be reviewed by the FGC. Instead, they will need to be posted on FORTH’s governance forum, deliberated upon by the community, and approved via an on-chain vote.\n\nQuarterly Budget:\nMaximum quarterly budget of $750,000\nBudgets and caps will be evaluated & adjusted every 6 months.\nGrant Allocation Committee:\nUpdated (May 19, 2022):\n\nFGC will consist of 5 committee members:\n\n1 Lead\n5 Reviewers\nEach committee will serve 2 fiscal quarters (6 months). After which, the committee members’ positions will be put up for renewal and voted upon by the community via on-chain vote.\n\nFGC will operate a 4 of 5 multi-sig that will distribute the funds to grantees.\n\nAny excess funds remaining at the maturation of the program will be returned to the FORTH DAO Treasury.\n\nSee Multi-Sig community vote/poll here: FGP: FORTH Community Grants Program - #42 by Fiddlekins 4\nScreen Shot 2022-05-19 at 3.03.27 PM\nScreen Shot 2022-05-19 at 3.03.27 PM\n1392×350 94.8 KB\nAll members of the FGC must introduce themselves using the template provided below:\n\nEthereum Address (provide the one you will be using for the Multi-Sig)\nDiscord Handle\nTwitter Handle (optional)\nStatement of Intention\nThis includes your values, vision, and reasoning behind why you want to be a part of the FGC\nWeb3 Qualifications / Skills (optional)\n(Introductions can be found in the concluding 'Introductions’ section below).\n\nCommittee Members\nUpdated (May 19, 2022)\n\nThe rationale behind forming a small grants committee (as mentioned before), is to enable efficient feedback loops towards facilitating grant evaluation and disbursal. Ultimately, the goal of this program is to bolster, promote, and fuel the utilization and growth of the Ampleforth ecosystem in tandem with the FORTH DAO.\n\nWe suggest the grants program is managed by a single lead. Herein we propose Jeremy Guzmán, author of this proposal. Jeremy has assisted in broadening AMPL & FORTH adoption through a multitude of video tutorials, written walkthroughs, and discord discussions - some of which have served as essential reference points for new community members.\n\nThe remaining 5 committee members should be recognized as “Reviewers.” These are individuals within the FORTH community that will assist in the maintenance of the grants program by ensuring Jeremy is leading efficaciously, prudently, and, of course, coherently. It is the reviewers’ responsibility to conserve FGC accountability by means of north star, key performance indicators. By adhering to this framework, FGC members are obligated to operate with the FORTH community and Ampleforth Ecosystem in mind. Compensation for the lead and reviewer roles are discussed below.\n\nProgram Lead: @Guz_MassAdoption | Jeremy Guzmán\n\nReviewer 1: @richy | Richy Qiao\n\nReviewer 2: @Pricelessjohn\n\nReviewer 3: @Nestor\n\nReviewer 4: @Brandon | Ampleforth\n\nReviewer 5: @ducc\n\nCommittee Compensation\nRemuneration should be done on a per proposal basis. The Lead should be compensated $750/proposal with a rate limit of 3 proposals per week. This compensation will be allocated to the FGC multisig as part of the overall funding of the program.\n\nReviewers will not be compensated in the FORTH Grants program.\n\nCompensation will be distributed the first of every month throughout the 6 month term.\n\nAreas of Focus\nThe following target areas will be evaluated during the grant review process:\n\nCommunity (marketing, educational, etc.)\n\nEcosystem Growth (e.g. Events & Hackathon, Bounties)\n\nTechnical (e.g. Protocol Development, Application Development, etc.)\n\nGovernance (e.g. Committees, Sub-committees, and DAOs that assist the FORTH & Ampleforth ecosystem)\n\nKey Performance Indicators (KPIs)\nThe success of this program will be based on, and measured by, the following criteria:\n\nQuantifiable criteria:\n\nNumber of applications submitted vs. # of application approved\nProject engagement post-funding\nNumber of active engagement within community forums (e.g. Governance Forum, Discord)\nGrowth in AMPL (and FORTH) pools funded via grants (e.g. increased TVL, unique addresses holding $AMPL and $FORTH, increase in delegates)\nImpressionistic criteria:\n\nOverall community engagement & sentiment\nImprovement to Ampleforth’s brand and market positioning.\nIncrease in # of holders vs. voters (delegates)\nTimeline & Process\nUpdated (May 19, 2022)\n\nThe Grants Program will kick off with two 3-month funding rounds. Applications will be accepted on a rolling basis and any grants funded during this period will be included in the corresponding round. The first round will be for 3 months, beginning one day after the approval of the Grants Program proposal. For example, if the proposal is approved on 5/20/2022, Round 1 will begin on 5/22/2022 and close on 8/22/2022. The following round (Round 2) will commence on 8/22/2022 and close on 11/22/2022. Upon the conclusion of the Grants Program’s experimental phase, a follow-up proposal will be submitted on the FORTH Governance forum to discuss the reinstatement of the program.\n\nUpon the approval and ratification of this proposal, the FGC will begin accepting applications on a rolling basis. Funding of these applications will be determined by the FGC on a case-by-case basis. Primarily the goal of this program is to prioritize long-term value capture for the Ampleforth community as well as for AMPL & FORTH holders.\n\nAt the end of each round, the FGC will share an application report containing all recipients and the amounts rewarded along with a description of each project. It is the FGC’s objective to operate in full transparency with the FORTH DAO community. This said, the FGC must do the following:\n\nA. Hold all conversations via a visible channel within the Discord’s Ampleforth server.\n\nB. Publish monthly reports mentioning: (1) Amount of funds disbursed, (2) Applications approved, (3) Description of Grantee projects, (4) KPI tracking.\n\nC. Hold monthly twitter space events allowing grantees the opportunity to showcase their project, discuss the intentions behind applying for a FORTH Grant, and the roadmap associated with the project moving forward. These events will be recorded and shared in a dedicated #ForthDAO section within the Ampleforth discord.\n\nMajority of the grants will have 1-2 milestones to accomplish. Based on the completion of these deliverables, the recipient will receive half of the grant upfront and the remaining portion upon the completion of all milestones associated. For larger grants, we expect to see multiple milestones (3+). To this end, payments will be divided amongst each completed deliverable.\n\nOverall, any & all grant applications submitted will be thoroughly assessed with the overarching improvement of the Ampleforth protocol in mind.\n\nIf the FGP (Forth Grants Program) has exhausted the allotted funding amount, the FGC can propose increasing the budget to governance. The final decision will be contingent on the FORTH community to vote on whether this budget increase will transpire.\n\nConclusion\n\nUpdated (May 19, 2022)\n\nIf the community sentiment & feedback is positive, the FGP will escalate this proposal to a temperature check via Signal (Snapshot). If ratified, application submissions will be accepted on a rolling basis post-approval.\n\nOur objective with this program is to act as the catalyst for Ampleforth ingenuity and innovation. We want to encourage and fully support any & all projects that want to build on top of Ampleforth Protocol which, as consequence, will translate to community growth, mass adoption, and utilization.\n\nLastly, it must be emphasized that we too are AMPL & FORTH holders. This being said, we are committed to seeing out the success of this program in parallel with the scaling & growth of the Ampleforth Protocol. However, we must also bear in mind that this is indeed an experiment. If for whatever reason it does not work, we must learn for any & all mistakes, reflect, iterate and improve towards more effective solutions.\n\nWe’re excited to see what the community has to say with this proposal and look forward to hearing everyone’s feedback below!",

      "title": "FGP: FORTH Community Grants Program",
      "content": "Author(s): @Guzman_MassAdoption\n\nLabel: #ampleforth-governance\n\nReference: Proposal - Hourglass Grant 7\n\nAbstract\nHourglass’s recent grant proposal has raised the necessary, and pertinent, topic of forming a community-operated FORTH Grants program. Continuing to use HourGlass’s proposal as precedent, all ideas - in the form of a formal proposal - should be submitted by FORTH’s community and further deliberated upon by the encompassing community members.\n\nFGP Rationale\nAt the time of writing, the FORTHClaim contract 1holds ~3,558,156 $FORTH (current USD market value: $27,682,460.06). Upon April 16th, these unclaimed $FORTH tokens will be repossessed and transferred to the FORTH DAO treasury. Taking this into consideration concurrently with Brandon’s proposal to execute first FORTH mint 3 (which would further fund the FORTH DAO treasury with 300,000 FORTH tokens - worth $2,334,000 at today’s market value) the FORTH DAO would kick off operations with a healthy treasury worth 3,858,156 FORTH ($30,016,453.68)!\n\nProposal\nInspired by precedent-settings forerunning initiatives such as Compound, Uniswap, and Aave Grants Program it is imperative that FORTH DAO follows suit to incentivize, reward, and often interrogate current Ampleforth mechanisms/systems/features that would largely improve the experience for all community participants.\n\nAs an experimental phase, it is proposed to initiate & monitor a pilot program that would run for 2 fiscal quarters (6 months total). A max grants budget of $1.5M (192,802.057 FORTH) is requested - relative to the size of the FORTH DAO treasury we believe this is a reasonable amount to initiate an MVP product (program). Upon the completion of this experimental phase, a subsequent proposal will be submitted to gauge community sentiment regarding the continuation of the program.\n\nIt is also proposed that a small operating committee is formed consisting of 5 members: 1 Lead and 4 Reviewers in an effort to mobilize and exhibit an efficient, transparent, and methodical application review process. For a well balanced committee, it is proposed that at least one core team member holds a reviewer role. It is intended to keep the committee to 5 members as it will enable judicious feedback loops and immediate iteration(s). The FORTH Grant Committee (FGC) will have the ability to administer grants on a discretionary basis based on the following criteria:\n\nSwift Grants: <$100,000\nStraightforward & Simple application process that is assessed by the FGC.\nFGC decision is to be made within 10 days after receiving the application.\nCommunity Grants: $100,000 - $500,000\nApplicants must post their proposal on FORTH’s governance forum.\nBased on the feedback given by the community, the committee will decide whether or not to approve these grants.\nFunds will be released based on deliverables (‘Gates’). Upon successful deployment of each Gate, % of the grant’s funding will be released to the grantee.\nAt the conclusion of the final ‘Gate’, the entirety of the grant’s funds should be allocated to the grantee - based on deliverables\nIt is worth noting that applicants can seek grants that exceed $500,000, however these proposals will not be reviewed by the FGC. Instead, they will need to be posted on FORTH’s governance forum, deliberated upon by the community, and approved via an on-chain vote.\n\nQuarterly Budget:\nMaximum quarterly budget of $500,000\nBudgets and caps will be evaluated & adjusted every 6 months.\nGrant Committee:\nFGC will consist of 5 committee members:\n1 Lead\n4 Reviewers\nEach committee will serve 2 fiscal quarters (6 months). After which, the committee members’ positions will be put up for renewal and voted upon by the community via on-chain vote.\nFGC will operate a 4 of 5 multi-sig that will distribute the funds to grantees.\nAny excess funds remaining at the maturation of the program will be returned to the FORTH DAO Treasury.\nCommittee Members\nThe rationale behind forming a small grants committee (as mentioned before), is to enable efficient feedback loops towards facilitating grant evaluation and disbursal. Ultimately, the goal of this program is to bolster, promote, and fuel the utilization and growth of the Ampleforth ecosystem in tandem with the FORTH DAO.\n\nWe suggest the grants program is managed by a single lead. Herein we propose Jeremy Guzmán, co-author of this proposal. Jeremy has assisted in broadening AMPL & FORTH adoption through a multitude of video tutorials, written walkthroughs, and discord discussions - some of which have served as essential reference points for new community members.\n\nThe remaining 5 committee members should be recognized as “Reviewers.” These are individuals within the FORTH community that will assist in the maintenance of the grants program by ensuring Jeremy is leading efficaciously, prudently, and, of course, coherently. It is the reviewers’ responsibility to conserve FGC accountability by means of north star, key performance indicators. By adhering to this framework, FGC members are obligated to operate with the FORTH community and Ampleforth Ecosystem in mind. Compensation for the lead and reviewer roles are discussed below.\n\nProgram Lead: Jeremy Guzmán\n\nReviewer 1: Richy Qiao\n\nReviewer 2: PricelessJohn\n\nReviewer 3: Nestor\n\nReviewer 4:Brandon | Ampleforth\n\nCommittee Compensation\nWe propose compensation for the program to follow the standard set by Uniswap, Compound, Aave’s proposal - $75/hr for a maximum of 30hrs/week. This compensation will be allocated to the FGC multisig as part of the overall funding of the program.\n\nThe time commitment for Reviewers would be less than that of the Program Lead. Compensation for Reviewers will be $75/hr for a maximum of 5 hrs/week.\n\nCompensation will be distributed the first of every month throughout the 6 month term.\n\nArea of Focus\nThe following target areas will be evaluated during the grant review process:\n\nCommunity (marketing, educational, etc.)\nEcosystem Growth (e.g. Events & Hackathon, Bounties)\nTechnical (e.g. Protocol Development, Application Development, etc.)\nGovernance (e.g. Committees, Sub-committees, and DAOs that assist the FORTH & Ampleforth ecosystem)\nKey Performance Indicators (KPIs)\nThe success of this program will be based on, and measured by, the following criteria:\n\nQuantifiable criteria:\n\nincrease in number of applications submitted vs. number of application approved\nProject engagement post-funding\nincrease in number of active engagement within community forums (e.g. Governance Forum, Discord)\nGrowth in AMPL (and FORTH) pools funded via grants (e.g. increased TVL, unique addresses holding $AMPL and $FORTH, increase in delegates)\nImpressionistic criteria:\n\nOverall community engagement & sentiment\nImprovement to Ampleforth’s brand and market positioning.\nIncrease in # of holders vs. voters (delegates)\nTimeline & Process\nThe Grants Program will kick off with two 3-month funding rounds. Applications will be accepted on a rolling basis and any grants funded during this period will be included in the corresponding round. The first round will be for 3 months, beginning one day after the approval of the Grants Program proposal.

Upon the conclusion of the Grants Program’s experimental phase, a follow-up proposal will be submitted on the FORTH Governance forum to discuss the reinstatement of the program.\n\nUpon the approval and ratification of this proposal, the FGC will begin accepting applications on a rolling basis. Funding of these applications will be determined by the FGC on a case-by-case basis.

The AMPL received will be used for liquidity mining rewards to AMPL LPs on VoltSwap.\n\nAmpleforth will stake the MTRG tokens into the [Bridge Fee Subsidy Program](https://docs.meter.io/passport/bridge-fee-subsidy-program).
