Although this was a great way to bootstrap buying and selling on Rarible.com in 2020, this rewards mechanism is no longer an effective tool. Wash trading is a rampant problem, but ultimately, it is a poor allocation of resources. In addition, a huge portion of $RARI recipients actually sell their $RARI following the drop, which has negative pressure on the $RARI price.\n\nAs we transition to funding more projects (see proposal here: https://snapshot.org/#/rarible.eth/proposal/0x746c0273412457015d0ac74179ba0a316aa8adfcd3b4e35a009bbd81b2840a3f), we need to start thinking about the best use of $RARI, such that our token economy doesn’t get crippled.\n\nOnwards, and upwards, frens.",

      "content": "Link to the original proposal: \nhttps://gov.rarible.org/t/granting-governance-power-to-the-rarible-dao-community/335\n\nRARI is the governance token of the Rarible Protocol and associated DAO. Over the last nearly 12 months, a really strong community has formed (see discord https://discord.gg/us2qCtrY ), and progress is increasing by the week. The goal of this community is to increase the adoption of the Rarible Protocol, as well as return value to RARI holders in other ways such as distributing grants to other projects, and building NFT projects in-house.\n\nHowever, there is currently very little community representation of this community at a governance level. Almost every person in the DAO who has been paid in RARI has had to convert their RARI to fiat eventually (people need to eat!).\n\nThis proposal is asking for 20K RARI in order to give our community a voice at the governance level. 100% of these tokens will be kept in a ⅗ Multisig, controlled by the following community members:\n\n- Eric Arsenault\n- Ezra Weller\n- Sarmad Ahmad\n- Maria Sanchez\n- Brandon Valosek\n\nOver time, we are expecting that key contributors to the community will own a share of governance tokens in order to align incentives and ensure we retain talent. Once this program is created and approved by the DAO, 100% of these funds will be returned to the parent Rarible DAO. These funds are an interim solution to give our community a voice, and allow us to move more quickly.\n\nThe community will use our own internal governance process to determine if we should support proposals that are proposed to Rarible DAO, and execute according to the wishes of this community.\n\nIn addition, we this proposal would also allocate 20K RARI to Alex and to Alexei (interestingly enough, they also don’t have representation in the DAO!) - these funds will also be returned to the parent DAO once tokens are issued to stakeholders.\n\nGiving Alex / Alexei governance power will have an additional benefit of allowing us to put all proposals up for vote. Currently, there is a certain bottleneck around proposals, with me (Eric), being the middleman trying to block proposals that they might not support. I see this as a big win.",

      "title": "Proposing The Rarible DAO Accelerator",
      "content": "**Introduction**\nThe Rarible DAO seeks to build an accelerator that will seed independent Web3 projects that utilize the Rarible Protocol. The authors are: @Dev and @Justin2234. Feedback provided by: @eric and @m0zrat .\n\nOur focus is to build a robust program and graduate the first cohort by end of Q1 ‘22.\n\n**Operations**\nWe propose the accelerator:\n\n1. Works with and invests in 6-12 projects (dynamically sized), in up-to-three month programs, which may culminate in a Demo Day to investors\n2. Invests in each project in the program: sizing TBD ($100K up)\n3. Has either i) 2 or more fixed date programs/year or ii) accepts applications on a rolling basis (less rigid deadline system due to the pace of the NFT market)\n4. Match teams/ideas from within the DAO and also source projects externally\n5. Has a 7 person Investment Council - 5 internal, 2 external\n6. Eventually add value to projects via our experienced, expert team of mentors\n7. Harness ideas/builds in the Builder Group to source talent, before supporting and funding\n8. Support projects post-accelerator on a discretionary basis\n9. Has its first projects attending by 1st Feb 2022\n\n**Success Metrics:**\n1. Projects receive investment from investors during/following accelerator\n2. Projects benefit the Rarible ecosystem and $RARI\n3. Increase interest in projects/teams wanting to build on the protocol\n4. Generate inbound interest in Rarible DAO\n5. Build a powerful alumni network\n\n**Funding**\nWe propose this monthly budget, for an initial 3-months, to launch the accelerator and aim to run the first program:\n\n|Personnel|Salary|Tokens|\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|Investment Council member - Dev|$12,500/month|TBD|\n|Investment Council member - Justin|$12,500/month|TBD|\n|Accelerator PM|$7,500k/month|TBD|\n|Experts/mentors pool|Up to $57,500/month|TBD|\n|Total personnel cost/month (USD)|Up to $90,000/month|TBD|\n||||\n|Miscellaneous costs|||\n|Includes legal, recruiting and other prof. services and subscriptions|Up to $10,000/month||\n||||\n|TOTAL MONTHLY COSTS (USD)|$100,000.00||\n|TOTAL MONTHLY COSTS ($RARI)($20.74/RARI)|4,822||\n\n3-month costs could be up to $300,000, with potential to spend less due to:\n\n* Sourcing of experts/mentors from inside the DAO and our network, reducing cost\n* Experts and mentors taking a while to hire, thus not existing as a cost early on\n\nWe propose setting up an accelerator multisig with these signers (3/5):\n\n* Eric\n* Dev\n* Justin\n* Ezra\n* Mariana\n\n**Bios of authors**\n\n**Dev - proposed ‘Accelerator Coordinator'**\n\nDev is a Web3 evangelist who’s been following decentralized monies since 2007, BTC since 2011 and ETH, DeFi, Metaverse and other Web3 trends since early-2020.

      "content": "**TLDR**\n\nThis proposal is to establish a Marketing Working Group in order to position Rarible Protocol DAO as a category leader and drive adoption of its protocol and related solutions.\n\n**Problem / Opportunity**\n\nRarible Protocol DAO has ground-breaking tech, and a solid strategy, but lacks brand identity, positioning, and formal GTM strategy. A dedicated – and fully funded – working group would address this problem. Primary KPIs include:\n\nBrand Favorability (e.g., “protocol of choice”)\nIncremental protocol exchange volume ($)\nNew signups / dev partners\nThese support the DAO’s goal to be the protocol of choice for the majority of NFT projects.\n\n**High-level Plan**\n\nFirst Month: Lock 2022 plan, including marketing strategy, timeline, deliverables, and budget requests. Firm up POV on team structure & op model. Open priority job reqs\nFirst Quarter: (above +) Hone positioning and value props, and develop new set of assets for use in campaigns, lifecycle marketing, and community-building. Develop POV on new features to sharpen positioning and address unmet user needs\n[Next Funding Round] Second Quarter: (above +) Lead 1 hero comms moment (ideally tied to product launch, partnership announcement, or similar) + follow-on campaigns and activations. Develop community programs and activate channel / ecosystem marketing. TBD brand campaigns outside of the major comms moment\nResourcing\n\n**Headcount: 7***\n1 Lead - marketing strategy + mktg ops\n1 PMM - positioning + product GTM\n2 Brand - brand identity & content, brand campaigns & activations\n1 Growth - lifecycle comms + acquisition\n1 Community - community programming + support\n1 Creative Director - creative strategy, production, and ops\nBudget: Production: $25K | Media/Fees: $35K\nProduction expenses increase if internal creative support is limited\nMedia expenses include acquisition experimentation but can increase if there is a desire to do brand activations, e.g., conference sponsorships, co-marketing, etc.\n*Headcount will be 3 in month one while plans lock and additional candidates are interviewed.\n\nThe total ask for the first quarter is $200K, which will be distributed among a Marketing working group multisig with the following signers: Eric Arsenaut, Jason Williams 4, Mariana Sanchez 2.\n\n**Accountability**\n\nMarketing will be embedded within the broader community and will communicate progress, updates, and results on a regular basis. Exact deliverables and cadence are to be determined but may look like the following:\n\nForward-looking marketing calendar locked and communicated on a quarterly basis\nBackward-looking marketing results and learnings communicated on a monthly basis\nForward-looking “Plans this Week” communicated early Monday on a weekly basis\nAdditionally, at minimum, the Marketing Lead will join weekly working group syncs and other relevant forums to contribute to the community.",

      "title": "Grants WG Funding Proposal",
      "content": "**TLDR**\nThis proposal is to establish and fund a Grants working group. The first working group experiment has been a huge success, which has allowed us to move quickly as a group, fund workers, and feel empowered with direct governance over funds. We have since established new working groups for ops, marketing, dev, and dev relations that have continued to be a major success. We now feel it is an appropriate time for a new working group to have autonomy over which projects receive grants. \n\n**Details**\nThese funds will be added to a newly created Grants Working Group gnosis safe which will be used to fund all grant related effors. Active signers on this wallet will be Eric, Sarmad, Ezra, Dev, and Noah. The wallet will require 3/5 signers for any transaction. The Grants WG will also have its own snapshot to vote on grant proposals. All current and future WG members will have the opportunity to earn a Grants WG related NFT which they can use to vote on snapshot proposals.\n\nEric Arsenault will act as the interim representative for this group, and ensure funds move to the DAO wallet address. He will also oversee the distribution of the Grants WG NFTs. Payments will be made in two installments of 100k each to a new Ethereum address:\n(Wallet has not yet been created)\n\nIndividuals and teams who are paid by this working group will consider themselves independent contractors and will report taxes accordingly. Forms W8-BEN and W9 will be filled out accordingly before funds get distributed to them when appropriate. Eric will be responsible for collecting these forms.\n\n**Funding amount, and use of funds**\n$200K equivalent in RARI as an initial amount of funding for the working group. These funds will be used to:\n* Fund new third party developers who succeed in the proposal process\n* Fund existing grantees ongoing milestones that already been approved of in the Rarible DAO snapshot\n* Hire individual contributors who will oversee the grants working group\n\nWe anticipate these funds will last us 3 months. \n\n**Accountability**\nThe working group will be completely transparent around how funds are used, and provide reports at the end of each month outlining grants. Members of the working group will continue attending community calls and will participate in governance processes. We will hold weekly grant calls on Friday to discuss upcoming proposals.\n\n**Why should Rarible DAO fund this?**\nWe need to keep pushing forward with the execution of a decentralized ecosystem. Ensuring that the rarible protocol continues to grow its protocol through third party development is essential for our success. Having a dedicated grants WG will allow rarible to be more selective and ensure every grantee meets the rarible standard.",

The first working group experiment has been a huge success, which has allowed us to move quickly as a group, fund workers, give contributors small tips, as well as feel empowered with direct governance over funds.\n\n### Details\n\nThese funds will be added to the Rarible Dao Protocol Operations Working Group and will be used to fund all operating efforts. Our current treasury is down to ~$25k and are proactively seeking additional funding. Active members of the Ops WG include Eric, Noah, Mark, and Sarmad. Eric, Noah, and Mark will act as signers for the new Ops Multisig Wallet, run on gnosis safe and parcel. They will ensure funds are allocated correctly. \n\nPayments will be made bi-weekly or monthly (as needed) to the following Polygon address:\n\n0x37e2F5A6B6eba65835BF90B104b44efd0a97cD04\n\nIndividuals who are paid by this working group will consider themselves independent contractors and will report taxes accordingly. Forms W8-BEN and W9 will be filled out accordingly before funds get distributed to them when appropriate. Eric and Noah will be responsible for collecting these forms.\n\n### Funding amount and use of funds\n\nSee below for September Use of Funds:\n\n![https://gov.rarible.org/uploads/default/optimized/1X/a7c219649eceed9a6b6fe6e09662e90ac32e1d5e_2_690x388.png](https://gov.rarible.org/uploads/default/optimized/1X/a7c219649eceed9a6b6fe6e09662e90ac32e1d5e_2_690x388.png)\n\nSo far we have used funds to set up our notion and discord - both essential communication tools for our DAO. We funded several hackathons. We also compensated Mark and Noah for their efforts in onboarding new members, desiging the onboarding flow, writing the DAO Notion, processing payments to workers, allocating Rari to developers, and reporting.\n\nWe are asking for an additional $50K equivalent in RARI as funding for the working group. These funds will be used to:\n\n- Pay current workers for their contributions to onboarding, reporting, treasury management, and overall efficiency\n- Hire new ops related roles as necessary\n- Fund any additional subscriptions managing documentation, email, and other important business tools\n- Fund travel and working related expenses\n- Continue to sponsor hackathon events\n- We expect these funds will last a number of months (>3)\n\n### Accountability\n\nThe working group will be completely transparent around how funds are used, and provide reports at the end of each month outlining expenses. Reporting for September will be issed at next community call October 7th, 2021.\n\nMembers of the working group will continue attending community calls and will participate in governance processes.\n\n### Why should Rarible DAO fund this?\n\nWe need to keep pushing forward with the execution of a decentralized ecosystem. Ensuring that the rarible protocol continues to grow, be accountable, and operate efficiently is essential for our success.",

These funds will be used to:\n* Hire a Creative Director (See newly created position [here ](https://jobs.lever.co/Rarible/cd31b3f8-92ef-4a9d-84ed-ddd54c21f5df))\n* Pay current workers for their contributions\n* Engage a third party firm for rebranding\n* Fund any additional tools for managing social accounts\n* Fund content creation\n* We expect these funds will last a number of months (>3)\n\n**Accountability**\nThe working group will be completely transparent around how funds are used, and provide reports at the end of each month outlining expenses.\n\nMembers of the working group will continue attending community calls and will participate in governance processes.\n\n**Why should Rarible DAO fund this?**\nWe need to keep pushing forward with the execution of a decentralized ecosystem. Ensuring that the rarible protocol continues to grow its brand and reach a larger audience is essential for our success.",

      "title": "Proposal to Optionally Restrict the Mint of Tokens",
      "content": "**TLDR**\nAllow projects to restrict who is allowed to mint a new token in their collection. This would ensure the possibility of having a restricted collection.\n\n**Problem / Opportunity**\nThe current contracts let everyone mint NFTs. Some projects require restricting this feature to specific users, but it is currently impossible. This directly impacts the quality of NFTs listed on the platform.\n\nThis is also a blocking requirement for my company Liteflow. Some of the platforms we are discussing expect to restrict the minting process to admin, partners, or specific users.\n\nThis issue seems to be a problem for other Rarible users, as you can see in this discussion I’ve initiated on Github:\n\n[GitHub](https://github.com/rarible/protocol-issues/discussions/11)\n**[Restrict addresses allowed to mint · Discussion #11 · rarible/protocol-issues](https://github.com/rarible/protocol-issues/discussions/11)**\n\n![https://gov.rarible.org/uploads/default/optimized/1X/7084b8390c758d8a4def407f75253a6d389403b7_2_690x345.png](https://gov.rarible.org/uploads/default/optimized/1X/7084b8390c758d8a4def407f75253a6d389403b7_2_690x345.png)\n\nThanks to the current smart contract architecture, once this feature is finalized, all the existing collections will be able to opt-in for it, so it will be required not to have any breaking change.\n\n**Funding Milestones and Payments**\nMilestones & payments:\n\nPhase 1: Analyse smart contracts - 1 day\nPhase 2: Add mint restriction (while still preserving the default option to be public) - 3 days\nPhase 3: Add support for off-chain authorization - 3 days\nPhase 4: Update of the documentation related to these changes - 1 day\nTotal days of work: 8 days\n\nPrice: $12,000\n\nPayments will be made to the following Ethereum address: 0x34EE3a64eab0D2Ae5d447e1fF94Ab6cf8136Fbce\n\nWe consider ourselves independent contractors of the Rarible DAO and will report taxes accordingly. Forms W8-BEN and W9 will be filled out accordingly before funds get distributed to Liteflow.\n\n**Use of funds**\nFunds will be used to pay for the research and development of this feature done by Liteflow.\n\nHowever, the funds will not include the smart contract deployment as Liteflow will not upgrade the existing smart contracts.\n\n**Business Model**\nThe business model of Liteflow is to sell white-labeled NFT Marketplace based on the Rarible Protocol. Our customers expect a Rarible-like platform but customized to their own needs. We also provide development services for blockchain projects, more details on https://liteflow.com/.\n\n**Team Members**\nAnthony Estebe: antho1404 (Anthony) · GitHub\nNicolas Mahé: NicolasMahe (Nicolas Mahe) · GitHub\nThe contact person for this project is Anthony Estebe. The contact information is anthony@liteflow.com, and the Discord handle is antho1404 | Liteflow#2211\n\nHow long has your team worked together? What other projects have you worked on?\n\nOur team has worked on Liteflow for the past 2 years. During this time, we worked on various blockchain projects like NFTs, real-time monitoring of blockchain apps and transactions, and blockchain automation. Before that, the core team worked for 3 years on a custom blockchain for decentralized executions MESG.\n\n**Accountability**\nLiteflow will participate in discussions in Discord and Github. The work will be pushed on Github and can be verified and accepted by the Rarible team.\n\nWhy should Rarible DAO fund this?\nWe believe this feature is required for many NFT projects. Once implemented, it will help the acquisition of the Rarible protocol by projects that want to create restricted collections.\n\n**Useful Links & Media**\n[Liteflow company](https://liteflow.com/)\n\n[Liteflow white-labeled NFT Marketplace](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VAkDTFgHjCKR6OXscrXA-j9t3ttztk3a/view)",

This includes constraints on 25% of the current treasury balance.\n\n**Details**\n\nWe are continuing to grow the DAO through new hires, working groups, and grants. In order to have continued success and growth, it is vital that Rarible DAO practices treasury management. Currently the treasury is primarily RARI tokens. A strong and autonomous treasury will allow us to withstand any sudden changes in the market and prolonged periods of volatility. Our goal is to preserve and grow assets while attracting new talent and teams regardless of market conditions. We will look to achieve our goals by adopting a risk averse strategy and bolstering our treasury through diversification. We will not make any changes to 25% of the current balance without further approvals from the DAO. We will consider new strategies that will offer flexibility, liquidity, and security. We are intent on ensuring the DAO has sufficient runway in case of a downturn or another cryptowinter. Due to the nature of treasury, some transactions are time sensitive and require initial privacy. Having a treasury committee will also allow us to respond quickly to market conditions.\n\n**Team**\n\nTreasury functions are currently handled by Alex Salnikov, Eric Arsenault, and Noah Kramer. We will look to expanded the team as needed.\n\n**Accountability**\n\nWe will be transparent around how funds are used by providing monthly reports that outline our current holdings.\n\nMembers of the Treasury committee will continue to be active participants in governance and community calls.\n\n**Why should Rarible DAO approve this?**\n\nWe need to be thoughtful about how we manage our assets.

      "content": "**Link to the Forum Post:** [https://gov.rarible.org/t/dev-working-group-funding/148](https://gov.rarible.org/t/dev-working-group-funding/148)\n\n### TLDR\n\nThis proposal is a proposal to create a dev working group (similar to the [other 1](https://gov.rarible.com/t/rarible-dao-working-group/15833) working group that was created (see use of funds report 1 [here 1](https://gov.rarible.org/t/working-group-proposal-use-of-funds/49/3)). The first working group experiment has been a huge success, which has allowed us to move quickly as a group, fund workers, give contributors small tips, as well as feel empowered with direct governance over funds.\n\n### Working Group details\n\n- Voting power in the working group will include the following people:\n    - Eric Arsenault, Isaac, Luis, Jonathan, Brody, Eugene, Alex, Jeff, Eduard, Skogard, as well as various others who have been very active in the community\n- Funds will be used to pay for various dev efforts, including our dev relations team.\n- We will place a constraint on the DAO of 30 members. Once we reach 30 members, the working group will divide into two groups of 15 member (or multiple smaller groups).\n- This is an experiment in structuring our DAO. There is a lot to learn, and may not be the long term structure of the DAO.\n- This working group (as well as others that might emerge), may become good candidates for delegation once this feature is live on the protocol.\n\nEric Arsenault will act as the representative for this group, and ensure funds move to the DAO wallet address.\n\nPayments will be made bi-weekly or monthly (as needed) to the following Ethereum address: 0xc9044DaabF32659aF9E6ecc58C7247f3Ec7d9C2f\n\nSome funds will be swapped for USDC and some other will be kept in RARI (2/3 swapped, 1/3 RARI)\n\nIndividuals who are paid by this working group will consider themselves independent contractors and will report taxes accordingly. Forms W8-BEN and W9 will be filled out accordingly before funds get distributed to them when appropriate. Eric will be responsible for collecting these forms.\n\n### Funding amount, and use of funds\n\n$300K equivalent in RARI as an initial amount of funding for the working group. These funds will be used to:\n\n- Pay workers for their contributions\n- Fund grants devs in our ecosystem think are important, including public goods\n- We expect these funds will last a number of months (>4)\n\nWe are expecting to pay roughly four devs to start working and experimenting with the protocol: Stefan, Way too Digital, Matt and Terrence (roughly 50K month, but to a large extent TBD). Salaries individuals will need to have the accountability and reporting requirements to ensure we have a performing group.\n\nThe amounts reserved for grants will be reported on as well by the dev working group, and will be funded on an ad-hoc basis.\n\n### Accountability\n\nThe working group will be completely transparent around how funds are used, and provide reports at the end of each month outlining expenses.\n\nMembers of the working group will continue attending community calls and will participate in governance processes.\n\n### Why should Rarible DAO fund this?\n\nWe need to keep pushing forward with the execution of a decentralized ecosystem. Empowering working groups is a key part of this process. Expect more of this soon.",

Develop applications and ideas for applications that will help the other projects get started quickly\n2. Help raise awareness about the DAO and ecosystem. Showcase what is being built, and how we are the leading NFT innovation. This will help attract more builders who are interested in shaping the future of NFTs on top of the Rarible protocol.\n3. Help developers working on the protocol\n4. Day to day communication and cooperation with DAO for the development needs and expansion of use cases.\n\n### My Background:\n\nI have been a full stack engineer for 3 years so far. Working on web applications in both the Web2 and Web3 space. My initiative is to completely switch to Web3 with full time commitment working for the DAO. I am the Frontend lead and a Co-Founder of Radical, a protocol that was funded by Rarible DAO and gives 30% of it’s governance token to the DAO. I feel really comfortable in the Rarible ecosystem and would like to provide my services and my knowledge as a software engineer to boost the DAO beyond every expectation. My work and specific background is all around the links below.\n\n### Useful links/ Contact information:\n\nEmail: [velkoskis@gmail.com](mailto:velkoskis@gmail.com)\n\nLinkedin: [https://www.linkedin.com/in/stefan-velkoski-9924a3170/ 1](https://www.linkedin.com/in/stefan-velkoski-9924a3170/)\n\nGithub: [https://github.com/StefanVelkoski](https://github.com/StefanVelkoski)\n\nDiscord: sv#2359\n\nTwitter: [https://twitter.com/stefannv93 1](https://twitter.com/stefannv93)\n\n### Funding Milestones and Payments\n\nThe first scope of my engagement will be to build a front-end lazy minting interface, where people can really easily lazy mint items to the protocol. Brief overview:\n\n1. Ability for a user to lazy mint single or multiple 721s.\n2. Ability to choose to create a new collection for your 721, or select an existing collection to mint to.\n3. Ability to upload an image, and select the number of items to mint.\n4. Optional ability to upload which address has the ability to claim these NFTs, and how many items each user can claim.\n5. The ability to set a price for these NFTs.\n6. All of the above is on a single page.\n7. “CLAIMS” page. Users should be able to log in, and see all the NFTs they can claim. Once they claim, the items disappear from this page. Some of the items they will need to pay for (with a price), others will only need gas (set price to 0).\n8. Home page and a success page after minting that redirects to [rarible.com](http://rarible.com/)\n\nI propose to work for 8 hours every day for 5 days at a rate of $35 per hour ( $5600 per month paid in RARI) .\n\nIf mandatory work is needed during some weekends it will be included within this rate.\n\nPayments will be made to the following Ethereum address:\n\n0x559441FEf78b7E27b66db69C11e5B3827e1aea96\n\nvelkoskis.eth\n\nI consider myself an independent contractor of the Rarible DAO and will report taxes accordingly. Forms W8-BEN and W9 or other applicable forms will be filled out accordingly before funds get distributed to me.\n\n### Accountability\n\nI will attend weekly community calls where I share my progress to the community, providing and updating the milestones accordingly as I make progress.\n\nI will be available full time for any meetings or discussions ( urgent or scheduled ) as a development representative of the DAO, regardless of time zone differentiation.",

It’s a haven for all things experimental and all things that glitch. It was founded on a very simple principle - build a marketplace as a community dao, built in opposition to venture capitalized behemoths like OpenSea. [https://www.screensaver.world](https://www.screensaver.world/).\n\nWe experiment freely with our art as well as our code and gather as a community to buy, sell, and create. We rally around a common understanding that the underground is just more fun.\n\n**Opportunity:**\n\nCurrently, we have around 400 artists, 7K mints, and over $20K in transactions. We run on the Polygon chain and are one of the most popular minting options on this L2. Although we love what we’ve built so far, we have aspirations of going from intergalactic dive bar to full on interstellar rave (or whatever the scaled up version of an intergalactic dive bar is).\n\nWe currently have only a very basic system of manual bidding in place. With this grant our community would include auctions as well as including the option of minting in editions. Additionally, we would overhaul the frontend with an updated UI, improved filtering, accounts, and homepage. The majority of this comes out of the box with the Rarible protocol with the exception of frontend work which would be where we’d direct the majority of funds. We believe with these updates we could easily become the most fun, accepting, and experimental place to mint on Polygon. In addition, this project would be one of the first projects on Polygon using the protocol.\n\n**Funding Milestones and Payments**\n\nMilestones & payments:\n\n- Milestones 1: UI design and mapping architecture\n- Milestones 2: Implementation of Rarible protocol and frontend development\n- Milestone 3: Swapping NFTs from previous contracts to new Rarible protocol contracts\n\n**Total payment:** $60,000 USD equivalent in RARI ($10K upfront to pay for hiring, $10K upon completion of Milestone 1, $20K upon completion of Milestone 2, and $20K on completion of milestone 3.\n\n**Timeline:** Depending on integration of Polygon in the works **@Rarible**, ~ 2 weeks for Milestone 1, 1 month for completion of Milestone 2, and full completion >3 months\n\nPayments will be made to the following Ethereum address: 0x05f9f41d10FD32d97E73fADAf6eDD42C227afd31\n\nI consider ourselves independent contractors of the Rarible DAO and will report taxes accordingly. Forms W8-BEN and W9 will be filled out accordingly before funds get distributed.\n\n**Team**\n\nJacob Small founder and dev at screensaver.world [jacob@lilnifty.com](mailto:jacob@lilnifty.com).\n\nWill also need to hire 1 dev to fully focus on the Rarible protocol and frontend development with Jacob. Additionally, we will need to hire a design contractor for the initial UI design process.\n\nJacob will be the touch-point for the Rarible <> Screensaver relationship. Jacob has spoken in depth with Rarible Dao lead, Eric Arsenault.\n\n**Accountability**\n\nI will attend weekly community calls, and provide updates on milestones as I make progress. I also plan to coordinate with the Rarible development team in regards to the architecture. In the event that we can’t fulfill our commitment, funds will be returned to Rarible DAO.\n\n**Why should the Rarible DAO fund this?**\n\nThere are a few reasons:\n\n1. Rarible Dao and the Screensaver community share a mission. We both believe the creation and distribution of art should be free for experimentation and not gated. We believe it is our duty to challenge the current gatekeepers and continue to insist on these principles.\n2. We currently operate with a governance token for voting and may further formalize our existence as a Dao. At this point, we could arrange a token share.\n3. Our code is open source so all protocol or non-protocol members will benefit from our codebase.\n4. You can come have fun on Screensaver.world!",

      "title": "Rarible Plugin for Biggest No-Code Platform [Grant Proposal]",
      "content": "**Link to the Forum Post:** [https://gov.rarible.org/t/grant-proposal-rarible-plugin-for-biggest-no-code-platform/62](https://gov.rarible.org/t/grant-proposal-rarible-plugin-for-biggest-no-code-platform/62)\n\nYes you read that right, No-Code, it is a big thing now, and really big projects are being built with it.\n\nLet me shortly introduce you to this no-code platform just so you know why I see so much perspective in this plugin (We are not affiliated with Bubble).[Bubble.io](https://bubble.io/) is the most powerful no-code platform for creating digital products. It is flexible, with many unique features such as customizable backend API, database, and database API, all without code!\n\nThe main tool that Bubble has, is **plugins** (similar to WordPress plugins), a plugin can be paid or free, you can add new powerful features to your app with them.\n\n### Opportunity\n\nWe are working on Bubble for more than 2 years now and we are active on their forum, we see very often questions about NFT marketplace, how they can build one, to be able to mint, place a bid and sell their tokens. So we decided that Rarible Protocol plugin would be the best fit here. We already have a plugin that allows users to interact with smart contracts and connect MetaMask, (it has become very popular in a short period)\n\nThe **Rarible plugin** will be for **free**! With all the features available in the API. It will bring immense interest in Rarible itself, how it works, and how to integrate it.\n\n### Funding Milestones and Payments\n\nWe already started to build this plugin. A demo page working on the Ropsten testnet will be done soon.\n\n- List of already working features\n- Phase 1 $5000:Plugin deployment with current main features (see list above) Demo pages.\n- Phase 2 $5000:Adding the rest of Rarible Protocol features.Plugin documentation page.\n\nTotal payment: $10,000 USD equivalent in RARI ($2K upfront for the already working features, $3K upon completion of Phase 1, $5K upon completion of Phase 2)\n\nTimeline: ~2 weeks (considering the plugin is already half done), full completion end of September.\n\nPayments will be made to the following Ethereum address:0x9DF3B01aeE76D0eDcC48873667f6F05B4F94A288\n\n### Use of funds\n\n50% Plugin development, demo pages, and documentation.50% Future plugin support (bug fixes, improvements, and helping users on the forum which is time-consuming).\n\n### Accountability\n\nWe plan to actively answer any questions on the plugin forum thread as well as in Discord and help users integrate it into their app. We will provide links to the plugin, demo page and forum thread as soon as it will be deployed.\n\n### About Us\n\nWe are [https://ezcode.co/ 4](https://ezcode.co/), a small team located in Eastern Europe.We provide services for clients and building templates and plugins on Bubble for 3 years now. See our [portfolio 2](https://bubble.io/contributor/ezcode-1525682873806x763134988024830800).\n\nYou can contact our developer directly: [ezcodeco@gmail.com](mailto:ezcodeco@gmail.com) or on discord inartin#9707 \n\nMostly we are active on [Bubble forum 1](https://forum.bubble.io/u/ezdev/summary)\n\n### Why should the Rarible DAO fund this?\n\n- The main focus of this plugin is to expand Rarible Protocol to new users that want to build something without the need to be web developers, it opens many doors to a lot of people.\n- Expanding the Rarible platform use-case\n- New NFT Marketplaces built based on Rarible Protocol\n- Flux of new users on the main platform (free plugin attracts people interest)\n- Making the plugin free will attract even more people that want to build an MVP, an app prototype or a small microservice, that way they will discover what Rarible is and how it works.\n\n### Useful Links & Media\n\n- [Bubble Raises $100M in Latest Funding Round](https://cheddar.com/media/bubble-raises-100m-in-latest-funding-round)\n- You can read [this article](https://medium.com/@artinalex?p=d0cc54e7faa7) from one of our team members, it is about why and how he uses Bubble while being a native app developer.\n- [Web3 Metamask plugin 1](https://forum.bubble.io/t/plugin-web3-metamask-by-ezcode/146625) forum thread, see how popular this theme is.\n- [Uniswap clone](https://ezuniswap.bubbleapps.io/version-test) built on Bubble with our Web3 Metamask plugin. It is on Binance Smart Chain, interacting with Pancake swap smart contracts.",

      "title": "Rarible Protocol Compensation Guidelines",
      "content": "In order to stay competitive and become the world class network we believe we can be, it is of top priority that we be able to recruit the top talent in the world. Competitive compensation packages in line with world class organizations are as part of this equation and below are proposed compensation guidelines for Rarible DAO.\n\nNote: many of these guidelines were inspired and borrowed from [Sushi 1](https://forum.sushi.com/t/sushiswap-core-team-hiring-guidelines-v4-1/2329) and Yearn (link [1](https://github.com/yearn/yearn-pm/blob/master/financials/reports/2021Q1-yearn-quarterly-report.pdf) and [2](https://gov.yearn.finance/t/yearn-retention-packages/9698)).\n\n### Salary ranges\n\nSenior Dev : 180K - 250K USD\n\nMiddle Dev : 120K - 180K USD\n\nJunior Dev : 80K - 120K USD\n\nSenior Ops/Business Dev : 120K - 150K USD\n\nMiddle Ops/Business Dev : 90K - 120K USD\n\nJunior Ops/Business Dev: 85K USD\n\nSenior Marketing/Comms : 120K - 150K USD\n\nMiddle Marketing/Comms : 85K - 120K USD\n\nJunior Marketing/Comms : 80K USD\n\nCommunity Manager: 65-85K USD\n\nPay ranges are a guideline and outstanding candidates can request an increased salary pending approval of the core team.\n\n### Vesting token\n\nA committee will be formed to determine the value and amount of vesting tokens. These tokens will vest over the following timeline:\n\n- 3 years linear vesting\n- 6 month cliff backdated to start date\n- With clawback (all unvested RARI returns to the DAO if someone leaves or is terminated)\n\nAmount of tokens will range from 10,000 to 150,000 tokens based on seniority and responsibility levels, as well as current price of RARI. These tokens will unfortunately only apply to full time contributors.\n\n### 2 month trial period\n\nWill be implemented for all new full time members\n\nDuring the trial period, every new hire will receive 100% of their due salary, in the form of a monthly grant, paid on a monthly basis, for the time they work.\n\nIf the trial period is successful, the new hire is made official. They are now protected by a severance package (in the case of a standard firing procedure).\n\nIf the hire isn’t confirmed at the end of the two-month period, the severance package is null.\n\n### Payment currency\n\nPayment for all members will be made in RARI tokens.\n\n### Part time hires\n\nRarible DAO thrives thanks to its contributors. Unfortunately, some of them are in a place that doesn’t allow them to commit full-time to the project.\n\nThey are more than welcome to contribute but they would be compensated with a monthly or hourly grant, based on their involvement in and time commitment to the project. The amount of the grant will be set up on a month-to-month basis, and will be adjusted to the part-time contributor’s degree of involvement.\n\n### Supporting Community Members\n\nWhere possible, Rarible DAO will look to hire community members who have been contributing actively, as opposed to hiring and finding talent externally.\n\n### Termination Policy\n\nLetting someone go is a painful, stressful experience that can put a strain on a project’s morale. That’s why we’d like to introduce transparent termination procedures so there are no surprises in the event of poor or malicious performance.\n\n- Any termination decision will be discussed and voted on by the Core Team.\n- Gross misconduct and dishonest behavior will result in immediate termination without any form of severance.\n- Standard terminations will be subject to a severance package based on the individual’s fixed salary. The standard severance package is one month’s salary.\n- Severance packages will be approved by Core Team and Multisig before being sent.\n- In the event of a high-profile termination, a post-mortem could be shared with the community, shedding light on the context and justification for the decision.\n\n### Vacation time\n\n- 4 weeks per year for everyone (or more, if you need, unpaid)",

      "content": "**Link to the Forum Post: [https://gov.rarible.com/t/decentraland-rarible-protocol-integration/16599](https://gov.rarible.com/t/decentraland-rarible-protocol-integration/16599)**\n\n**Summary** :\n\nRarible recently launched the Rarible Protocol, which includes a decentralized and open source NFT exchange as well as minting contracts, an indexer, and various other bells and whistles for those building in the NFT space.\n\nA great use case for the protocol is to integrate with marketplaces and metaverses like Decentraland. Below outlines how this could work.\n\n**Abstract** :\n\nThis scope includes:\n\n- Integrate Decentraland with the Rarible Protocol such that it is possible to buy NFTs directly within the Decentraland interface\n- Create a fee on the Decentraland front-end such that fees are directed to Decentraland DAO (optional)\n- Allow parcel owners to display NFTs and to receive a certain % of fees from the sale via fee splits (which can be set)\n\n**Motivation** :\n\nThe benefit to Decentraland is that you would be able to sell items directly from Decentraland, without directing users to other external applications. Right now, when you click on an NFT, you get something like this:\n\nLink to Example: [https://gov.rarible.com/uploads/default/original/2X/2/2ff79e50f8b24000e668c1249be70400905a06fd.jpeg](https://gov.rarible.com/uploads/default/original/2X/2/2ff79e50f8b24000e668c1249be70400905a06fd.jpeg)\n\nThese NFTs can be purchased on Opensea currently, and it is even possible for parcel owners to monetize on OpenSea [referral fees](https://opensea.io/blog/tutorials/earning-bounties-affiliate-program/) (1%).\n\nUsing the Rarible Protocol, we can do much better. Rarible Protocol is the only open source and community owned NFT exchange protocol.\n\n**Specification** :\n\nWhat would this look like after integration with the Rarible Protocol?\n\n1. Items could be purchased directly from within the interface\n2. A fee could be set within the interface (2.5% for example, which is what [Rarible.com 1](http://rarible.com/) has)\n3. That fee could be directed to Decentraland DAO (it is possible to set this fee upon creation of this integration, OR, we could just set it to zero. Maybe we could have a separate vote to determine what fee to include for Decentraland DAO)\n4. Fees and Royalties from external platforms (like SuperRare) could be carried over using the protocol\n5. NFTs from different blockchains could also be displayed (for example, we are integrating with Flow, Polygon, Moonbeam)\n6. What is even more cool is that the Rarible Protocol has fee splitting. So for example, a parcel owner could display NFTs that he does not even own, and receive a % of fees from that process!\n\n**The “Ask”** :\n\nThis is a co-funded grant application between Rarible DAO and Decentraland DAO. This proposal is asking for:\n\n- A grant to develop this functionality. Rarible DAO and Decentraland DAO can fund this together, with a 5K contribution from Decentraland DAO (vested over 3 months with a 1 month cliff as per [link](https://docs.decentraland.org/decentraland/community-grants/)). Rarible DAO is asked to contribute 7K, with 1/2 paid upfront and 1/2 upon completion.\n- In terms of implementation, HPrivakos has expressed interest in helping with this (yay!). Funds will be vested and distributed to the following address: 0x2fa66abee1b3b6afe5c14566ed4fdbadaf982b56\n- A portion of the fund will be used for design work or possible support from other devs, which will be handled by HPrivakos.\n\n**For** : You are voting FOR the proposal above and a payment of 5K from the Decentraland DAO side for this integration.\n\n**Against** : You are voting AGAINST the proposal above.\n\nNOTE! here is the link to the forum post for decentraland: [https://forum.decentraland.org/t/decentraland-rarible-protocol-integration/1653 1](https://forum.decentraland.org/t/decentraland-rarible-protocol-integration/1653)",

The amount of rewards paid out to creators would be largely based on the total amount of Rari we generate through our sales volume or fees.\n\nIn order to promote higher quality token gated links and prevent users from creating/spamming random gated links simply to receive rewards, we would base the amount creators receive on the traffic these links generate which we’re currently tracking. New clicks on gated links would be calculated and paid out bi-weekly or monthly.\n\nIn further rewarding token gating on MintGate, we aim to increase the value of NFTs minted through our platform with additional utility. Creators can sell NFTs for profit and residual income through royalties. Offering unlockable or gated media content to holders of this NFT allows buyers to speculate on the value of the creator’s content and future growth, which incentivizes reselling of the NFT as they continue to produce higher quality content.\n\nRewarding these creators in Rari based on new clicks further incentivizes creators to produce high quality content and share these links through their own social networks. It also provides us a new metric to assess the success of creators generating and sharing token gated links on the platform through amount of Rari paid out.\n\nIf this proves to be successful in incentivizing further creation and sharing of token gated links, amounts paid out to creators would be increased with MintGate retaining less of the rewards in order optimize for faster growth of the platform through creators’ networks.\n\nOf the amount MintGate would retain, 50% listed above, half would be held in our Gnosis wallet for voting on proposals with the other half being set aside to provide liquidity or possible liquidation if needed.\n\nWe consider ourselves independent contractors and will report taxes accordingly. Forms W8-BEN and W9 will be filled out accordingly before funds get distributed to our team.\n\nWe understand that the RARI rewards are intended to reward *real* sales volume and will take steps along with Rarible DAO to ensure only real sales are rewarded.\n\nWe also understand that rewards may not be 100% accurate and will work with members of the DAO to solve any issues during this process.\n\n**Where funds should be sent:**0xC8b97EC6FF5e660358b6718847aB74D64f65469e",

      "title": "Cyber: Rarible Protocol Integration Proposal",
      "content": "### Link to the Forum Post: [https://gov.rarible.com/t/grant-proposal-cyber-rarible-protocol-integration/16100](https://gov.rarible.com/t/grant-proposal-cyber-rarible-protocol-integration/16100)\n\n### TLDR\n\nCyber offers an easy way for artists and collectors to show their NFTs in experiences. The simplest way to understand Cyber is by taking a look at an example here: [https://oncyber.io/lol-thedebut1 2](https://oncyber.io/lol-thedebut1) (DustMonkey actually used Cyber to unveil his collection and sold out in less than 24 hours on Rarible)\n\n### Problem / Opportunity\n\nThis is a proposal to integrate Cyber into the Rarible Protocol. The end result is a “BUY NOW” button within Cyber experiences, such that users can buy NFTs directly through the protocol. In addition to this, it will be possible to split fees such that: a portion of the sales go to Cyber, a portion of the sales go to the Cyber experience owner, with the remaining going to the NFT owner. This integration would allow Cyber to monetize directly at the app level, and pave the way for other apps planning to go this direction. Currently, Cyber is loosely integrated with OpenSea and can receive a referral fee of 1%. With the protocol, Cyber will be able to monetize whatever value they want on their front-end (2.5% possibly), which is a huge increase for larger sales, or future planned drops.\n\n### Funding Milestones and Payments\n\nMilestones & payments:\n\n- Milestones 1: Integration of a buy now button for assets available on the rarible protocol\n- Milestones 2: Enable fee splitting from the sales of NFTs on the protocol such that: Cyber receives a fee, Cyber NFT experience owners receive a fee, curators can receive a fee, and NFT owners also receive their cut.\n- Future milestones might include: integrating Rarible’s auction mechanism when live, as well as integrating other drop mechanisms being worked on by the community\n\nTotal payment: $40,000 USD equivalent in RARI ($5K upfront to pay for hiring, $20K upon completion of Milestone 1, $15K upon completion of Milestone 2).\n\nTimeline: Depending on integration of the SDK in the works **[@Rarible](https://gov.rarible.com/u/rarible)**, ~1month for Milestone 1, full completion >3 months\n\nPayments will be made to the following Ethereum address: 0x9158bdbe113E619B88AF544feaC4967B2a914e71\n\nI consider ourselves independent contractors of the Rarible DAO and will report taxes accordingly. Forms W8-BEN and W9 will be filled out accordingly before funds get distributed.\n\n### Use of funds\n\nFunds will be used to hire an additional Dev and pay ourselves whilst working on the integration into the Rarible protocol.\n\n### Business Model\n\nCyber receives a referral fee by enabling simple buying within Cyber experiences.\n\n### Team\n\nRayan Boutaleb, CEO/Tech Lead, Ecole 42/University of Saint Andrews, [rayan@oncyber.io](mailto:rayan@oncyber.io)\n\nNeferest, Full Stack Engineer, Former [https://supercharge.fyi](https://supercharge.fyi/) , [neferest@oncyber.io](mailto:neferest@oncyber.io)\n\nWill also need to hire 1 dev to fully focus on the Rarible protocol with Rayan\n\nRayan will be the touch-point for the Rarible <> Cyber relationship. Rayan has attended a previous community call and has built relationships with some of the projects building in our community.\n\n### Accountability\n\nI plan to attend weekly community calls as possible, and provide updates on milestones as I make progress. I also plan to coordinate with the Rarible development team in regards to the architecture. In the event that we can’t fulfill our commitment, funds will be returned to Rarible DAO.\n\n### Why should the Rarible DAO fund this?\n\nThere are a few reasons:\n\n1. This will pave the way for other apps looking to sell NFTs from various different platforms directly within their interface. We will provide a case study and guide to help future projects accomplish this.\n2. By funding Cyber, Rarible might benefit if we ever decide to launch a token (zero certainty around this at this point). Regardless, we would love Rarible DAO to help shape the future of the project.\n3. We have an awesome platform, and would love to work together, just as partnering for drops, or creating curated shows. This proposal would align interests further along this direction. We also intend to allow users to mint on our platform. As we integrate the protocol we could allow an option to mint with Rarible.\n\n### Useful Links & Media\n\n[https://oncyber.io/lol-thedebut1](https://oncyber.io/lol-thedebut1)",

      "title": "Rarible DAO Working Group Proposal",
      "content": "### Link to the Forum Post: [https://gov.rarible.com/t/rarible-dao-working-group/15833](https://gov.rarible.com/t/rarible-dao-working-group/15833)\n\n### TLDR\n\nThis is a proposal which aims to empower the community of builders working on Rarible DAO.\n\nThere is currently a large disconnect between the builders working on Rarible DAO and the Rarible Protocol, and the RARI tokenholders. For the most part, very few RARI holders are involved in the community building efforts, and don’t have the best understanding of where the community needs to deploy capital in order to be most effective and grow.\n\nThis proposal aims to create a working group, with its own treasury that is can allocate as it sees fit. This working group will itself be a DAO, initially using the DAOstack ([alchemy.daostack.io 4](http://alchemy.daostack.io/)) platform. DAOs on Alchemy are reputation based, and as members contribute to the community, they will be able to earn reputation in the DAO.\n\nThis proposal also aims to combine two previous forum posts for working group funding: [https://gov.rarible.com/t/proposal-funding-to-pay-for-tools-to-support-dao-working-groups/15308/3 3](https://gov.rarible.com/t/proposal-funding-to-pay-for-tools-to-support-dao-working-groups/15308/3) and [https://gov.rarible.com/t/dev-working-group-proposal/15295 1](https://gov.rarible.com/t/dev-working-group-proposal/15295).\n\nSee Phase 1 Image: [https://gov.rarible.com/uploads/default/original/2X/3/341d8e0ddabc0989c17aaea151d5dfe485403285.jpeg](https://gov.rarible.com/uploads/default/original/2X/3/341d8e0ddabc0989c17aaea151d5dfe485403285.jpeg)\n\n### Working Group Focus\n\nThe main areas of focus for the working group will include:\n\n- Communications\n- DAO Operations\n- Developers and Developer Relations\n\nEach of these areas has different objectives, that over the course of the next few months, will be further refined. The work-in-progress objectives for Communications and Ops can be seen [here 1](https://www.notion.so/Distilled-Brainstorm-Ideas-e03e843f17de40dda5f7cbb28cd5642c) and [here](https://www.notion.so/Refining-Objectives-v2-July-14-2021-5452dd9dea08412d8f4db6c0cecd03b4) respectfully.\n\nIn addition, the overall objectives of the DAO are a work in progress (we’ve just completed the 3rd in a series of 3 sessions on the topic), which will further inform goals and objectives of the different working group areas.\n\nEach of these areas will hopefully, with this funding, be able to further refine and clarify their objectives which should all ultimately tie to our overall objectives at the protocol level (driving adoption of the protocol being a key one). Mapping out these objectives will be one of the deliverables complete as part of this working group, in addition to providing a report of the expenses.\n\n### Working Group Details\n\n- Voting power in the working group will include the following people:\n    - Eric Arsenault, Mark, Max, Elliot, Cooper, Zack, Isaac, Luis, Brody, Skogard, Ali, Jeff, Harry (among others!)\n    - It will also include key members of the [rarible.com 1](http://rarible.com/) team, like Alex and Ethan\n- Funds will NOT be used to pay individuals who have existing proposals.\n- We will place a constraint on the DAO of 30 members. Once we reach 30 members, the working group will divide into two groups of 15 member (or multiple smaller groups).\n- This is an experiment in structuring our DAO. There is a lot to learn, and may not be the long term structure of the DAO.\n- This working group (as well as others that might emerge), may become good candidates for delegation once this feature is live on the protocol.\n\nSee Phase 2 Image: [https://gov.rarible.com/uploads/default/optimized/2X/4/4462ac9eac1c1c70700d21535ed61d99756faa94_2_432x1000.jpeg](https://gov.rarible.com/uploads/default/optimized/2X/4/4462ac9eac1c1c70700d21535ed61d99756faa94_2_432x1000.jpeg)\n\nEric Arsenault will act as the representative for this group, and ensure funds move to the DAO wallet address.\n\nA one time payment will be made to the following Ethereum address: 0xc9044DaabF32659aF9E6ecc58C7247f3Ec7d9C2f\n\nIndividuals who are paid by this working group will consider themselves independent contractors and will report taxes accordingly. Forms W8-BEN and W9 will be filled out accordingly before funds get distributed to them when appropriate. Eric will be responsible for collecting these forms.\n\n### Funding amount, and use of funds\n\nWe are requesting a $50K equivalent in RARI as an initial amount of funding for the working group. These funds will be used to:\n\n- Pay workers for their contributions\n- Pay for tools (like a Notion subscription) or software services\n\nThis will include a wide range of things, from developers offering support to other developers, to supporting community builders in our discord.\n\n### Accountability\n\nThe working group will be completely transparent around how funds are used, and provide reports at the end of each month outlining expenses.\n\nMembers of the working group will continue attending community calls and will participate in governance processes.\n\n### Why should Rarible DAO fund this?\n\nThe current group of DAOists have very little empowerment (most, if not all, are not RARI whales!). Also, for the most part, large RARI holders have no idea what is happening at the DAO level. This funding will help bridge this gap, by giving a working group more autonomy, to move more quickly, and make quicker decisions for the benefit of Rarible DAO and the protocol.\n\nIf this experiment is successful, we will ask for further funding to continue the initiative, which should help grow out the ecosystem.\n\n### Useful Links & Media\n\n[https://gov.rarible.com/t/proposal-funding-to-pay-for-tools-to-support-dao-working-groups/15308/2](https://gov.rarible.com/t/proposal-funding-to-pay-for-tools-to-support-dao-working-groups/15308/2)\n\n[https://gov.rarible.com/t/dev-working-group-proposal/15295](https://gov.rarible.com/t/dev-working-group-proposal/15295)\n\n[https://alchemy.daostack.io/](https://alchemy.daostack.io/)\n\n[https://www.notion.so/Distilled-Brainstorm-Ideas-e03e843f17de40dda5f7cbb28cd5642c](https://www.notion.so/Distilled-Brainstorm-Ideas-e03e843f17de40dda5f7cbb28cd5642c)\n\n[https://www.notion.so/Refining-Objectives-v2-July-14-2021-5452dd9dea08412d8f4db6c0cecd03b4](https://www.notion.so/Refining-Objectives-v2-July-14-2021-5452dd9dea08412d8f4db6c0cecd03b4)\n\n[https://rarible.com/](https://rarible.com/)",

      "content": "### Note From Rarible Team: Although the following proposal originally included Phase 1 & 2, we are only considering Phase 1 at this time.\n\n### Link to the Forum Post: [https://gov.rarible.com/t/grant-application-footium-rarible-ecosystem-integration/16076](https://gov.rarible.com/t/grant-application-footium-rarible-ecosystem-integration/16076)\n\n### TLDR\n\nFootium is an NFT 2.0 football (soccer) management game looking to integrate with the Rarible protocol, Rarible would serve as an additional storefront for our in-game assets (in-combination with our native marketplace). Footium has immense potential, tapping into one of the largest markets in gaming, while being the only blockchain based football game to provide serious gameplay with awesome collectibles. At the moment, our native marketplace is primitive, we are integrating with Rarible to facilitate wider interoperability with the NFT ecosystem.\n\n### Problem / Opportunity\n\nWhat problem or opportunity are you looking to solve?\n\nWe have noticed a lack of engaging gameplay in the NFT space, particularly in football games. SoRare has done well with its licensed digital football collectibles, however, its gameplay amounts to little more than speculation. Footium combines the gameplay of great football management games like Football Manager with NFTs and DeFi attributes.\n\nA problem at the moment within Footium is the overhead of developing our own custom NFT marketplace. Whilst our native transfer market has a functional buying and bidding system (demoed at the end), it is tethered to the game, we understand that part of the value NFTs provide are owners’ capacity to seamlessly exchange their assets on different platforms.\n\nRarible is the perfect platform to integrate with because it provides a protocol for us to integrate with our application as well as its own marketplace which facilitates wider adoption of Footium collectibles in the NFT ecosystem.\n\nWe wish to give users the freedom to list assets on both marketplaces, our own and Rarible’s simultaneously, via the Rarible protocol.\n\n### Funding Milestones and Payments\n\nWe have currently delivered on implementing our own native marketplace,\n\nHigh level milestones & payments:\n\n- Phase 1: Main integration with the Rarible protocol 15/08/2021\n    - Each club will have its own page with name, owner, price, bids, transfer history, and link to Rarible\n    - Each player will have its own page with name, owner, price, bids, transfer history, and link to Rarible\n    - The user will be able to buy, sell, place a bid, accept a bid through the Footium UI\n    - By using Rarible, the user will also be able to list a player/club for a sale and place bids without any transaction fees.\n    - $10,000USD\n\nSee technical appendix for more details.\n\nPayments will be made to the following Ethereum address:\n\n0xb929Cc17b31dFC745CC8d9c9F5249bF3b4bEECEa\n\nWe consider ourselves independent contractors of the Rarible DAO and will report taxes accordingly. Forms W8-BEN and W9 will be filled out accordingly before funds get distributed to our team.\n\n### Use of funds\n\nFunds will be used to pay ourselves whilst working on the integration into the Rarible protocol, plus to pay for the time spent accommodating for future updates to the protocol.\n\n### Business Model\n\nWe have a token model that will provide our company’s treasury in the short-medium term, there should be no need for the Rarible DAO to provide subsequent grants.\n\nThe crux of the business model is predicated on the importance of staking in the game’s own ecosystem. We have Club NFTs which hold a more general club object and an academy object.\n\nThe Academy object can be conceptualised as an NFT farm, where the quality of the farm’s yield is an increasing function of the number of tokens staked, the quality of the yield corresponding to players’ valuable attributes.\n\nThe Club object is effectively the interface between the user and the underlying game, this interface can be understood in terms of the quality of the overall team put forward by the club to play against the other teams of the league. Here, a team’s overall rating benefits from a multiplier, as an increasing function of the amount of tokens staked.\n\nWe would also wish to use Rarible’s royalties capabilities, to garner transaction fees from trade as well as implementing transaction fees for the trade that occurs on our platform.\n\n### Team Members\n\n- Jordan Lord: Lead Developer. Project Lead & Software Engineer. He is currently a full-time developer at Netcraft, a cybersecurity company. His Linkedin profile is [here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jordan-lord/).\n- James O’Leary: Smart Contract Developer & Business Lead. He is currently an Economics and Management student at the University of Oxford. His Linkedin profile is [here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/james-o-leary-697473106/).\n\nWe’ve been working together on this project as a team for just over 10 months, having come together during the Encode Spark Hackathon in Summer 2020. Subsequently, we completed the Algorand pre-accelerator, since these more structured building schedules we have maintained a steady pace of work and now wish to take the project to another level.\n\nThe contact person for this project will be Jordan Lord. His contact information is [jordanlord999@gmail.com](mailto:jordanlord999@gmail.com) and his Discord handle is trusting_chandrasekhar #1581.\n\n### Accountability\n\nOur project will attend weekly community calls, and provide updates on our milestones as we make progress. In the event that we can’t fulfill our commitment, funds will be returned to Rarible DAO. We will also work with community members to ensure updates are distributed through the Rarible communication channels.\n\n### Why should Rarible DAO fund this?\n\nFootball, and sports games more generally, have proven their worth in the NFT space. SoRare’s native marketplace generates significant transaction volume, not far after Rarible. When Footium gains traction, it would likely generate similar transaction volumes to SoRare, exposing Footium’s user base to NFTs more widely would benefit Rarible and the wider NFT ecosystem more generally.\n\nWe believe it would be mutually beneficial for Rarible to become a key stakeholder in our protocol, and as a matter of aligning our incentives we wish to give the Rarible DAO a number of tokens. The number of tokens corresponding to the grant’s value with respect to our valuation.\n\n### Useful Links & Media\n\nAs mentioned earlier, we have a functioning market of our own, demoed below.\n\nDemo of selling: [https://www.loom.com/share/e2ef3038eda3416a85a66adae53e7049?sharedAppSource=personal_library](https://www.notion.so/e2ef3038eda3416a85a66adae53e7049)\n\nDemo of Buying : [https://www.loom.com/share/d11fba1a540e4607919f8e1b3c967b76?sharedAppSource=personal_library](https://www.notion.so/d11fba1a540e4607919f8e1b3c967b76)\n\nDemo of Bidding: [https://www.loom.com/share/5b6a1f3eefe44cfb867a4526f43022ba?sharedAppSource=personal_library](https://www.notion.so/5b6a1f3eefe44cfb867a4526f43022ba)\n\n### Technical Appendix\n\nMilestone technical details:\n\n- Phase 1: Main integration with the Rarible protocol 15/08/2021\n    - Update the Footium API to read/proxy to the Rarible protocol when working with market/order state\n        - Flow: User calls Footium API to get current market state for an NFT, Footium API then calls the Rarible API, based on the result from the Rarible API it will update the Footium game state, then return the correct part of the Footium game state.\n        - The above prevents multiple calls to the Rarible API, return game state if the last request to Rarible API was recent.\n    - Tweak Footium buy/sell UI to be consistent with data from Rarible and user flow with Rarible\n    - Update placing a bid transaction to work with the Rarible protocol.\n        - First it will approve spending of the asset to the Rarible protocol\n        - Then it will sign the order data object.\n        - Finally it will post the order data object to the Rarible API.\n        - The bid will now appear on the Footium UI.\n    - Update selling an NFT.\n        - Firstly, approve spending of the NFT to the Rarible protocol.\n        - Then sign the sell order data object.\n        - Finally, post the sell order to the Rarible protocol.\n    - Update accepting a bid or buying.\n        - Firstly, approve spending of the asset to the Rarible protocol.\n        - Then sign the transaction and post via standard eth API (web3).\n    - Add club buying/selling/bidding\n        - This is currently not implemented in Footium.\n    - Implement the correct transition of parent club when buying/selling a player.\n        - (Not sure how to do this yet, will this require passing metadata to the Rarible protocol? Then handling metadata on transaction to correctly reassign parent club).\n        - Should the owner of a player always be the Footium FootballClub contract?\n        - Therefore we should artificially change ERC-721 so that the user who is able to transact is always the owner of the parent club and that can never be changed by the user.\n    - Convert player to ERC-721 standard\n        - Currently this is not implemented due to the nature of player belonging to a club but the club owner having the power to transfer the player.\n    - Add a feature flag for being able to swap usage of Rarible protocol with the in-built Footium contracts\n        - This will influence the API behaviour.\n        - And it will influence the front-end transaction signing/posting behaviour.\n    - $10,000USD",

      "content": "### Link to the Forum Post: [https://gov.rarible.com/t/app-mining-on-rarible-protocol-v2/16101](https://gov.rarible.com/t/app-mining-on-rarible-protocol-v2/16101)\n\n### TLDR\n\nThe high level concept behind the app mining program is that instead of the DAO distributing RARI rewards to buyers and sellers, the DAO will instead *allow applications building on the protocol to decide where their share of RARI rewards are going, based on the sales volume or fees obtained by each application.* An application for example could decide to keep the RARI rewards, or they could decide to give them to their users, or their DAO (among other possibilities).\n\n### High Level Overview\n\nWe roll out an app mining program in three phases:\n\n- Phase A: This is the current phase. There is no app mining program. The DAO gives rewards to buyers and sellers of the rarible ecosystem directly.\n- Phase B: Phase B will last 6 months after beginning and allows applications to direct rewards proportional to fees collected on the protocol. During the early stages of Phase B, we will work with projects to ensure we have the right information to calculate the share of RARI for each project. Phase B will not start as soon as this proposal passes, instead, it will start once we sort out the operational issues associated with the program.\n\n### Token Distribution Details\n\n- Phase A: 75% to buyers and sellers on the [rarible.com](http://rarible.com/) platform, 25% to Rarible DAO treasury.\n- Phase B: 10% to RARI stakers once staking is live (until then, the 10% will go to the DAO), 35% to the DAO, 55% to the discretion of applications on the protocol (based on fees collected).\n\n### Other Details\n\n- Rewards for Phase B will be scaled quadratically\n- There will be a white-listing process, wherein applications must be approved by the DAO (this will be a simple proposal asking to be whitelisted + a bare minimum of details)\n- Rewards will be proportional to fees collected by the applications on the protocol, as this is a good proxy for the revenue generated on those apps. This is a better option than revenue of each app since the protocol has a shared order book, and NFTs might be listed on App1, the sold on App2.\n- Any application which is notices to have fake volume activity will be immediately removed from the app mining program.",

      "title": "My proposal to contribute to the DAO (Community, Communications and Ops)",
      "content": "On May 20th, **[@eric](https://gov.rarible.com/u/eric)** posted [open job roles](https://gov.rarible.com/t/some-open-dao-jobs-roles/13101) for the Rarible DAO. As someone who has been consistently participating in our calls and community since March, this piqued my interest. To me this sounded like an exciting opportunity to contribute and further embed myself into the community in a meaningful way.\n\n**About me:**\n\nI’m a multi-disciplinary artist and content creator with a genuine passion for crypto and emergent technologies. I’ve spent the last 8 years producing music/art, touring, producing events (music series and art shows), podcasting (exploring intersections of art and technology), and building networks and community spaces. I am adaptable, collaborative, and relationship driven in my projects. I thrive in experimental and unconventional environments.\n\nSocials: [Twitter](https://twitter.com/markredito), [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/markredito/).\n\n**My experience:**\n\nMy involvement in different crypto communities has allowed me to learn and understand the unique ways our space approaches product design and community building. It has also allowed me to network and be mentored by a diverse range of experts and thinkers in the space.\n\nMy current involvement includes:\n\n- [Creator Collective](https://twitter.com/cc_nft) - Creator community within Rarible DAO (with **[@fractilians](https://gov.rarible.com/u/fractilians)**)\n- [Songcamp 1](https://songcamp.mirror.xyz/) - Music x Web3 experiments\n- [MysteryDrop](https://www.mysterydrop.app/) - Breakbox NFT platform (with **[@isaacpatka](https://gov.rarible.com/u/isaacpatka)** , **[@GianniDalerta](https://gov.rarible.com/u/giannidalerta)** , Owen)\n- [FWB](https://fwb.help/Manifesto) - a lifestyle/culture DAO, active member.\n- Here is my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/markredito/) for more information about my skills and project experiences.\n\n**How I plan to serve the Rarible DAO**\n\nMy experience and interests within crypto are mainly in the space of community and culture. In our previous community call, I recognized this is an area of need (see whiteboard [here](https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_lDHyB9k=/)). This would be my area of focus in this initial phase.\n\nI have already helped to build the creator and community ecosystem of the DAO. Below are some of the things I have helped to establish and what I aim to continue to build further:\n\n**Community Management, Communications and Operations:**\n\n- Collaborate with the communications team to brainstorm and execute content initiatives that benefit the community.\n- Engagement/maintenance of socials and discord channels.\n- Partner with other DAO members to collaborate on activities and incentives to encourage participation in the ecosystem.\n\n**Creator Relations:**\n\n- Outreach, onboarding, ambassadorship and networking.\n- Develop opportunities to collaborate and engage.\n- Be the point person for creative partnerships and community building.\n\nIn the long term, I see myself evolving in a hybrid role that touches multiple areas of the ecosystem.\n\nMy hope is to build culture scaffolding that brings the DAO together. A future roadmap can be to establish a thriving community hub, events production, and design incentives/content that continue to encourage more participation from the community.\n\n**Accountability:**\n\nI will continue to be present in all our community and governance activities. I will utilize current communication channels to give community updates. My DMs (marksimbiotic#2828) will be open on Discord for DAO member inquiries.\n\n**My Ask**\n\n- $2,500 Monthly in RARI. This covers my full commitment of 12 hours per week. When workload doubles as expected over time, I will ask to revisit this monthly allocation.\n- A two month trial period will start once the proposal passes.\n- After which monthly allocation would be on an ongoing basis until I resign or the DAO decides it doesn’t need the service anymore.\n- I consider myself an independent contractor and will report my taxes accordingly.\n\n**Why fund this?**\n\nMy aim is to help build a well-rounded ecosystem along with **[@eric](https://gov.rarible.com/u/eric)** and other members of the DAO. This promotes an authentic and emergent culture to unfold that can build on Rarible’s identity, and can be a space that actively nurtures creativity, real collaboration, and innovative growth. This proposal is an investment in that direction.\n\n> “Rarible is designed as the NFT protocol for all, owned and governed by the community” - Rarible Docs.\n\nThis statement about the Rarible protocol resonates with me and I believe the Rarible DAO shares the same ethos of community ownership and governance. I believe that developing the community and its culture is necessary to achieve that. Lakshman Sankar has [written a great piece 1](https://ls.mirror.xyz/v_AK57oyXtp8hLmtq7p7R8ZkMrqxXmtFQkaQjz_5xg4) about “ecosystem development” which I think summarizes a lot of my aim.\n\nThank you!",

      "title": "Contributing to the DAO (Ecosystem Communications)",
      "content": "**TLDR**\n\nThe Rarible ecosystem is growing. The DAO needs support with content creation and communication on protocol and ecosystem development. This is key to attracting and retaining NFT innovators. I would like to offer my services to the Rarible DAO to help fill this gap.\n\n**Problem / Opportunity**\n\nThe Rarible DAO is becoming the go-to place for creatives in the NFT space: for both artists and builders (tech). Many cool projects are being developed in the Rarible ecosystem. However, these projects are only visible to people who spend time in the community, join calls etc. In order to attract and retain creatives and innovators, communication and education are key. The DAO [is looking for contributors](https://gov.rarible.com/t/some-open-dao-jobs-roles/13101), including support with content creation and communication around protocol and ecosystem developments (also closely tied to marketing/growth). I would like to offer my services to the DAO in these areas. (And work alongside other DAO contributors such as Eric and Mark)\n\n**I believe I could support the DAO with the following areas (subject to change):**\n\n- Develop and share some general communications (ie Newsletter, Twitter).\n- Develop Topic/Project-specific assets. These could include Blog posts/Essays, Visuals (i.e overview of existing projects), and more. (See similar content I created in the past, in “My Background” section)\n- Support in other areas (depending on needs/time and interests)\n\n*For “Topic/Project specific assets”, some potential themes I would like to explore:*\n\n*Why build on top of the Rarible protocol?What is the mission/vision of the Rarible DAO?What is [Project x building on top of Rarible protocol]? What do they do, what is their vision, how does it work?How does Rarible fit into the overarching NFT ecosystem?How does Rarible compare to other NFT protocols?What is [Feature x] and what does it mean for the future of NFTs?What does the future of the Rarible ecosystem look like?What is the future of Media? How will we get there?*\n\nI will reuse existing materials, attend weekly meetings, connect with the team, and research the broader space. For content around core topics, I will organize working sessions with interested community members to capture and reflect the voice of the community/DAO. (for example: for the vision/mission). For larger assets, prioritization will be discussed with other DAO contributors.\n\n**My contribution to the DAO will have several benefits:**\n\n1. Help raise awareness about the DAO and ecosystem. Showcase what is being built, and how we are a hub for NFT innovation. This will help attract more builders who are interested in shaping the future of NFTs on top of the Rarible protocol.\n2. Onboard people to the space and get them excited about NFTs & the Rarible DAO through education.\n3. Putting thoughts on paper, making connections and performing market research can lead to new insights and to the identification of trends/gaps. These findings can help inform future project/protocol/dao developments.\n\n**My Background:**\n\nI (Max Hatesuer) have been covering projects/topics in the Web 3 space for over a year.

      "content": "### TLDR\n\nMy name is Ali Azam and I would like to join the Rarible DAO as a builder (Discord handle: ali2251#4380, linkedin [here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ali-azam-01112b71/?originalSubdomain=uk))\n\nThis is a proposal to create a few auction mechanisms on top of the rarible protocol. Concretely, this proposal will start with Dutch Auctions, Vickrey Auctions and English Auction. Having different ways to sell NFTs is important in order to keep people excited give them several ways to sell NFTs. The auction will bring in more users and give the existing user the opportunity to make decisions in their best interest. In this proposal we outline 3 auction mechanisms to be implemented as Solidity smart contracts and to be integrated with Rarible protocol.\n\nNOTE: the scope of the project may be change in nature following discussion with the Rarible team.\n\n### Funding Milestones and Payments\n\nMilestones & payments:\n\n- Phase 1: Auction smart contracts for Dutch auction with documentation and complete suite of tests written in hardhat and integrated with Rarible protocol + $2K USD + delivery in 3 weeks\n- Phase 2: Auction smart contract for English auction with complete suite of tests documentation and integration with Rarible protocol + payment amount in $1.5K USD + delivery in 2 weeks\n- Phase 3: Auction smart contract for Vickery auction with complete suite of tests documentation and integration with Rarible protocol + payment amount in $1.5K USD + delivery in 3 weeks\n\nTotal payment: $5000 USD, complete upon delivery of phases.\n\nPayments will be made to the following Ethereum address: 0x6aA3449855767951F559387A72D5060c412246ae\n\nI consider ourselves independent contractors of the Rarible DAO and will report taxes accordingly. Forms W8-BEN and W9 will be filled out accordingly before funds get distributed.\n\nFunds will be used to pay me (Ali) for the development work.\n\n### Accountability\n\nI plan to attend weekly community calls, and provide updates on milestones as I make progress. I also plan to coordinate with the Rarible development team in regards to the architecture of the auction mechanism. In the event that we can’t fulfil our commitment, funds will be returned to Rarible DAO.\n\nFurther Information: The code will be pushed to this repository: [https://github.com/ali2251/auctions/tree/main/contracts](https://github.com/ali2251/auctions/tree/main/contracts)",

      "content": "### Summary\n\nWe’re going to increase trust and safety across the Rarible platform and NFT ecosystem using predictive analytics.\n\n### Problem\n\nWash trading is a process whereby a trader buys and sells a security for the express purpose of feeding misleading information to the market.\n\nWash trading and ill-intentioned behaviours are the leading problems deterring new users from entering the NFT ecosystem and it has been an issue with Rarible too.\n\n### Solution\n\nScour AI agent is our solution that acts as a watchdog to flag the spoofing transactions between the traders that manipulates both volume and price of the assets in the NFT ecosystem thereby protecting the platform (marketplace’s) market mining.\n\nWe are building a detailed knowledge graph of the complete NFT transaction history that includes transfers, wallet addresses, and reward token distributions.\n\n### Business Model\n\nWe would like to provide this tool as a SaaS Model (Software-as-a-Service).\n\n### Minimum Viable Product\n\nBased on the interactions with the Rarible team, we have already built a sample static web application that is capable of detecting wash trades, as a MVP to prove our hypothesis in identifying the wash trades.\n\n### Payments\n\n- Phase 1: Both Rarible and our team will be working in a collaborative fashion for a period of first 2 months.\n- Phase 2: Standalone product flagging the wash traded wallets.\n\nThe payment comprises of two components : Component A and Component B\n\n- Component A is a fixed base price ($8000 in USDT) that covers up the infrastructure and operations cost.\n- Component B is a variable price that amounts to 5% of the wash trade that happens on a weekly basis that the internal Rarible team has not identified internally.\n\nThe contract runs for 2 months, the Component B will be waived during this period. Deliverables will be at the end of every week. Fees for Component B will be assessed after 2 months.\n\nPayments will be made to the following Ethereum address: 0x283cC2177BC157708a5Ed19a53159185a18DBE78 (ERC20 - USDT)\n\nWe consider ourselves independent contractors of the Rarible DAO and will report taxes accordingly. Legal compliant invoices will be issued accordingly before funds get distributed to our team.\n\n### Use of funds\n\nA portion of these funds will be used for operations and infrastructure that includes transaction fees and contract deployment fees as well as the procurement of a server that can continuously handle marketplace support prediction requests, data aggregation and model training.\n\n### Team Members\n\n- Vijay Pravin Maharajan: **Founder**.

Contact information is [vijay@bitscrunch.com](mailto:vijay@bitscrunch.com) and his Discord handle is **[@Vijay](https://gov.rarible.com/u/vijay)** | bitsCrunch#9613\n\n### Accountability\n\nWe’ve developed a number of relationships with Rarible team members including Alex Salnikov, Eric Arsenault and Ethan van Ballegooyen. We will be working hand in hand for milestones eight through ten above. It’s very important that the finished product adheres to Rarible’s technical specifications. We will also work with community members to ensure updates are distributed through the Rarible communication channels.\n\n### Why should Rarible DAO fund this?\n\nWe’re very interested to continue deploying AI-enhanced safety features in the NFT marketplace space — like the wash-trade detection & image forgery and provenance detection. While NFTs are more popular than ever, the most impactful way to strengthen the platform is with wash-trade detection and flagging models.\n\nIn our analysis of 1/3 of confirmed malicious trader wallets; 2.95 million $RARI tokens have been minted to addresses which were involved with malicious trading activity. This represents ~10% of the $RARI token distributions.\n\nOur goal is to reduce $RARI tokens rewarded to malicious actors. This will drastically increase platform trust by detecting and stopping wash trading in a manner that is fast, reliable and scalable. We also eliminate the manual effort of approximately **8 hours per week** of the support team.",

      "content": "Link to the forum post: https://gov.rarible.com/t/proposal-nfp-non-fungible-people/13482\n\n### Summary\n\nNFP (Non-Fungible People) is a platform that will allow people to mint Twitter verified NFTs that will have 3D artwork generated based on their profile, therefore representing themselves or their brand. With this, Social Media Figures will have a new avenue to monetize their brand and an opportunity for people to invest in high potential individuals.\n\n### Overview\n\nThe recent boom in NFT technology brought to light the immense opportunities that can be explored. We have witnessed the use of NFTs for 3D art, music, tweets, real estate, etc, however, we haven’t seen NFTs used in any way related to personal branding.\n\nWe are building a platform where for two months users will be able to mint twitter verified NFTs using their twitter account. The NFTs will consist of a 3D animation artwork generated based primarily on their profile picture and handle, and will include random elements based on other metrics such as follower count. Up to 5 NFTs can be minted by profile with each NFT being part of a different tier, the first of them totally free. Higher tiers will become more expensive but also will have more complex animations. Below we present the first iteration of a mid tier NFP made by ManWithNoName which is our 3D animation NFT artist. You can see some early iterations of our concept in the following link: [https://manwithnoname.space/nfp/preview.html](https://manwithnoname.space/nfp/preview.html)\n\nWith our concept we keep each person’s NFPs as unique while buyers can quickly identify who an NFT belongs to in a marketplace. Furthermore, inspired by Rarible’s original idea of unlockable content we can create another pathway for Social media figures to interact in an exclusive way with their most loyal followers, opening a lot of possibilities on how to further monetize their brand in the future. They will also receive secondary market sales royalties due to the speculation around them/their brand. Current NFT projects mostly target Artists/Creators, however, we got a step further and use NFTs to empower ANYONE whether they are influencers, Writers, Traders, Scientists, Sportists, thought leaders, upcoming figures, etc.\n\nSince its foundation we have seen a relentless development in the Rarible ecosystem which has clearly become a leader in the NFT field. This is even more clear with the recent protocol update that allows to implement Lazy minting (gasless minting) and deal with royalties at the protocol level. Looking at all this it becomes clear to us that integrating as much as possible with the Rarible Ecosystem will drastically reduce user friction. We intend to integrate both the Lazy minting and royalties solution with our custom ERC721 smart contract, while providing the users with tutorials on how to use the Rarible marketplace for buying, selling and even top up their crypto wallets directly with FIAT.\n\nIn our view this will create a great user experience. Anyone will be able to create their own NFTs, especially the free tier 1, without worry about having a pre-funded ethereum wallet or risking the erratic cost of the ETH network transaction fees. Moreover, by using Rarible’s Lazy minting this will ensure Rarible to be the marketplace for the 1st sale of the NFP, both providing the user a direct path to a marketplace while bringing new traffic and awareness to the Rarible Ecosystem.\n\n### Comparables\n\nIn order to frame the positioning of NFP in the wide NFT space we compare our project with others such as Meebits (same creators of CryptoPunks), Hashmasks and CryptoTrunks.\n\nMeebits is the closest project that uses a 3D concept, however, their goal is to be used as your own personal avatar in the metaverse and a character with which you can easily set up 3D animations. In the case of the Hashmasks they are iconic for their pre-generated 2D artwork to be cured in collections that can represent a narrative due to the interactions (similar traits) they possess. The CryptoTrunks have innovated on the art generation concept by using your wallet information as a seed to combine different pre-established traits in a final “Trunk”.\n\nIn the case of the NFPs our goal is to take the concept of generative art a step further by fetching social media data to customize a 3D animation representing the creator person/brand itself. As an added value to the NFPs we intend to add unlockable content related to the brand of the Social Media figure.\n\nSome might look at our project and wonder also how we compare with Mintgate. Mintgate has been developing a very interesting concept: using tokens as a gate to content. This concept is indeed something that we also want to implement in our NFTs, however, our goal is not to create a competitor technology to Mintgate, but instead leverage their work to empower our concept.\n\n### Funding proposal\n\nWe aim to be granted funding in order to develop the first version of out platform with the following features:\n\n- Development of costum ERC-721 smart contract integrated with Rarible’s Lazy minting and royalty distribution protocol\n- Website development where users will be able to verify themselves using twitter and generate the desired NFPs tiers\n- Integrate with Mintgate to allow for simple content to be unlockable by owning an NFP\n- Allow users to view their owned NFPs in their gallery in our platform and view the locked content\n- Development of cloud infrastructure allowing for the NFPs rendering in real-time. This consists of a network of servers that will run the artwork generation script in order to generate the NFT artwork. Each rendering takes between 30s-2minutes (depending on the animation complexity) and therefore we need multiple cloud servers running in parallel to be able to scale with demand and avoid the users waiting too long for their artwork to show up.\n\n**Milestones & payments:**\n\n- Milestone 1: Proof of concept: custom generated 3D animated NFP with different twitter accounts as input. Includes alpha version of the cloud service. Value: $5k. Deliv. date:5 June.\n- Milestone 2: Costum ERC-721 smart contract integrated with Rarible Lazy Minting and Royalty protocol that can implement the proof of concept. Deliverable: being able to mint on the POC, available to view on [rarible.com](http://rarible.com/). Value $10k. Deliv. date: 12June.\n- Milestone 3: Final 3D animations scripts for the different NFP tiers. Deliverable: 5 scripts / demonstration of animations.Value $5k. Deliv. date: 12 June.\n- Milestone 4: Working website that implements the front end for twitter verification and NFP creation. Value $10k. Deliv. date: 19 June.\n- Milestone 5: Basic unlockable content feature added to the website implemented using Mintgate. Value $5k. Deliv. date: 26 June.\n- Milestone 6: Developer documentation on how we integrated the Rarible protocol with our own custom smart contract. Value $5k. Deliv. date: 26 June.\n\nTotal payment: $40.000.\n\nPayments will be made to the following multi-sign Ethereum address: 0xF688F9407a7F993A653f5565C4c9b92635E38811\n\nThe key contact persons are Ptero#8037 and Guifel#7610 on discord, or at our email: [verifynfpeople@gmail.com](mailto:verifynfpeople@gmail.com).\n\nWe consider ourselves independent contractors of the Rarible DAO and will report taxes accordingly. Forms W8-BEN and W9 will be filled out accordingly before funds get distributed to our team.\n\n### Team members\n\nJose Rui Silva, PhD Candidate on Space Instrumentation\n\n- [https://www.linkedin.com/in/josé-rui-silva-50ab2793/ 5](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jos%C3%A9-rui-silva-50ab2793/)\n\nGuifel, Blockchain developer at Reflexer Labs\n\n- [https://github.com/guifel](https://github.com/guifel)\n\nDaniel Moreira, Marketing & Communication Manager\n\n- [https://www.linkedin.com/in/danielzmoreira/ 2](https://www.linkedin.com/in/danielzmoreira/)\n\nCollaborators\n\n- ManWithNoName, NFT artist, [https://rarible.com/manwithnoname](https://rarible.com/manwithnoname)\n\n### Accountability\n\nTo ensure team accountability we intend to participate in the weekly community calls and give weekly status updates of the project development.\n\n### The Future\n\nAfter the launch of our product we intend to keep working on other ways for the NFP’s creators to monetize their brand. One of our potential visions is improving on the unlockable content so that our platform can become a way for the NFP creator to interact in a more exclusive way with the NFPs holder. Imagine a private vault with content managed by the creators and only accessible by the NFPs holders. As an example, imagine as a buyer being able once a week to hop on a 1 hour call with your idol, or having access to some traders’ alpha leaks, being able to pick the brain of your favorite writer or the process of your favorite artist. Other ways of monetizing their brands will also be researched, maybe new collections or other future concepts.\n\nAfter this first collection we intend to create a token to power a DAO that would be able to decide the future direction of the project or share in a part of the project future revenue (staking), in which we would like to give the Rarible DAO a special place.\n\nIn the longer term we envision the possibility to extend our core concept beyond twitter and into other platforms, especially instagram and TikTok, and even the creation of an easy to use mobile app allowing anyone to do all of this from the comfort of their phones.\n\n### Why Fund This?\n\nOur project shows an innovative use case for the NFT technology. Moreover, by integrating with the rarible ecosystem we ensure this to become the marketplace to go for the NFTs created and therefore bring in traffic that will foster ecosystem growth.\n\nA deck of the project can also be found in: [https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1VcCvrseEI7JKjclhqWMyFLFVLUucq2o8xvX1T9H5hDI/edit?usp=sharing 2](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1VcCvrseEI7JKjclhqWMyFLFVLUucq2o8xvX1T9H5hDI/edit?usp=sharing)",

We are a community of artists exploring tools in the web3 and NFT space. We’re working on being the go-to place for artists of all stripes to onboard into the vast and wonderful world of crypto. We aim to serve our community through education and community activities.\n\nOn April 22nd, we successfully fulfilled our first pilot project called the #earthdaynft2021 campaign which was funded by the Rarible DAO. Working closely with Eric Arsenault and Rarible, this campaign proved to be a great success. Artists all over the world supported this campaign and confirmed the importance of community building among creators within the Rarible ecosystem.\n\nWe see the initial pilot as only the beginning. We are ready to launch longer-term initiatives and continue to serve the Creative community with engaging and interesting opportunities.\n\n### **Core Team:**\n\n**Nathalie Nunez** - Project and Campaign Lead\n\nFor over 20 years has been a Digital + Analog Arts Educator + Marketing Specialist. She has worked as a Teaching artist for various Visual Art centers, STEM Programs. She has also been a member of art collectives, ran community arts projects, and worked as a Brand liaison. She is passionate about creating connections and collaborative opportunities between IRL and the crypto world.\n\n**Mark Redito** - Project Manager and Artist Relations\nA professional musician, visual artist and content creator for over a decade. A big part of my work as an artist explores the intersection of art and emergent technologies. My experience and current projects includes: producing a podcast that explores art and technology intersections ([SIM/BIO/SYS](https://www.twitch.tv/sim_bio_sys)), project manager for music + web3 experiments ([Songcamp](https://songcamp.mirror.xyz/)) and resident artist and dot connector for upcoming NFT platform ([MysteryDrop](https://github.com/MysteryDrop/mystery-drop)). I’m passionate about exploring possibilities for artists/creators to further expand their expressions and offerings in the web3 space.\n\n### Below is our proposal to offer our services to the Rarible Creative Community.\n\nOverview on how we plan to serve the community:\n\n1. Create campaigns and competitions that engage the crypto-art community.\n2. Provide education and professional development opportunities.\n3. Curate and connect participating artists to companies and projects.\n4. Build partnerships with other crypto-creator communities and the wider digital art space.\n\nWe plan on integrating those key elements into the development of our upcoming campaigns. It’s important for us as a collective to be able to thoughtfully iterate and adjust to the needs of the community. This is why we have built-in reflection, brainstorming, and planning into our timeline.\n\n**Project Outline:**\n\nEducational Content Series + Competition Campaign\n\nThis educational content hopes to engage the creator community and bridge the gap between crypto native and non-crypto native artists. By highlighting useful techniques/tips from artists that are innovators in their medium, we aim to provide learning opportunities for beginner and veteran artists alike. Our goal with this series is to inspire and educate as well as expand participating artists’ engagement in the crypto sphere. We see this initiative as an opportunity to reinforce Rarible’s mission to empower artists and the creator economy.\n\n**Video Breakdown**\n\n1. Each campaign will have an Interview with a featured Artist curated by the collective. This opens the opportunity to share their story as an artist as well as their journey with crypto and NFTs.\n2. The Featured Artist will showcase a helpful tip or skill in the form of a short tutorial. This may include walkthroughs and screen captures of their work. A few examples can be: music production tips, 3D design tips (using Blender or C4D) and video editing tips (using Final Cut Pro or Premiere).\n3. Competition Parameters will then be presented:\n- The theme for the campaign. This can be an audio/visual theme, a prompt, or a cultural moment.\n- The inclusion of the quick tip in the art creation. Participating artists have to incorporate the tip or skill shared by the featured artist.\n- To enter the competition, the final artwork has to be minted on [Rarible.com](http://rarible.com/).\n\nWinning artists will be featured on our Social Media platforms and receive RARI prizes. Each campaign will have a $5,000 USD (RARI Equivalent)t award split between two winning artists. One chosen by the panel (collective and featured artist) and the other by community vote via our discord. A stipend of $500 (RARI Equivalent) will also be given to the featured artist as a token of gratitude for their time and effort. We chose RARI as prizes to build alignment with the artists and incentivize them to use the platform.\n\n**Video Series Co-Hosts:**\n\nMark (marksimbiotic#2828) and Nathalie (fractilians#3980)\n\n**Video Campaign Structure:**\n\nWe will be creating 2 Major Campaigns over the next 3.5 months. Brainstorming, planning and execution will begin upon funding of this proposal.\n\n**General Project Timeframe: A total of 15 weeks. Schedule as follows:**\n\n- Week 1 and 2 - Brainstorm, planning, prep and outreach\n- Week 3 and 4 - Record, Edit and Release Content.

Week 1-3 - Marketing + Support +Submission Deadline\n    - After launch of video, participating artists will have the 3 weeks to watch the video, create their artwork and mint on Rarible Protocol\n    - Work submitted throughout will be featured on Creator Collective socials: instagram, twitter, youtube and discord.\n    - Participating Artists - Will also be encouraged via social networks (or Web3 native marketing tool) to share the campaign and tag us with their work on IG and Twitter.We will reach out to other artist communities on discord and socials to encourage cross-pollination and engagement.\n    - Featured artists will also help spread the word on their social platforms.The end of the third week will be the deadline for all submissions from participating artists.\n3. Week 4 - Winner Announcement\n    - Winners announced - Community Prize ($2500 USD RARI Equivalent) and Panel Prize ($2500 USD RARI Equivalent)\n        1. We will be inviting various community members to be our judging panel.\n        2. Having a community prize will help drive community involvement and sharing of projects.\n    - Winners\n        1. Will be featured on a follow up interview on youtube.\n        2. Will be featured on our newsletter.\n        3. Will be featured on Rarible Home page ( TBD)\n\n### The Ask\n\nTotal ask is $34,625 (RARI equivalent)$23,625 (RARI equivalent) of the total goes to the core team and $11,000 (RARI equivalent) for prizes and artist stipend. This pays for the core team for a 3.5 month commitment and for 2 campaigns.\n\n**Itemized allocation as follows:**\n\n$5,500 (RARI equivalent) per campaign will go towards prizes and featured artist stipend:\n\n- $5,000 (RARI equivalent) for Community prize and Panel Prize, split 50/50.\n- $500 (RARI equivalent) for featured artists.\n\n$6,750 (RARI equivalent) monthly will go towards the core team and transaction costs:\n\n- Nathalie, Campaign Lead - $3,000 (RARI equivalent)\n- Mark, Project Manager & Artist Relations - $3,000 (RARI equivalent)\n- Jorge, Discord Moderator - $500 (RARI equivalent)\n- Transaction costs - $250 (RARI equivalent) . This covers transaction costs of sending funds to the core team and to featured artists and participants.\n\nThe scope of contribution and service represents 10-20 hours per week of work from each team member commensurate with current active campaigns and project volume. This includes content ideation and creation, artist relations, project management, community management and marketing. This is expected to increase over time. We would ask to revisit allocation when workload doubles. We will continue to provide value on behalf of the Rarible Community for the next 3.5 months and review at the end of that period.\n\nWe see ourselves as independent contractors and will report taxes to the proper tax institution in which we reside.\n\n### Proposed payment schedule\n1. First payment of $6,750 after the initial plan for the first campaign concept is created and shared.\n2. Second payment of $5,500 after the first campaign videos / content are created (in time to give out the funds).\n3. Second payment of $12,250 after the second campaign concept is created and shared.\n4. Final payment of $10,125 upon completion.",

Go ahead and try, we’ll wait.\nBy having a nice native app to mint NFTs, Rarible could attract to the platform the biggest class of digital creators out there, social media stars and influencers.\nRarible users should be able to mint their NFTs directly from their phones in a smooth and easy manner. A couple of taps and hey, presto! User has her immortal collectible ready to sell and can share the Rarible link to buy directly to the social media of her choice.\nNFTs created on Minty Fresh are minted via the Rarible API and show up on the user’s account on rarible.com and are sold exclusively on Rarible.\nMinty Fresh will focus on simplicity to reduce friction in the minting process.\n\n### Business model\nMinty Fresh will collect fees on the following point-of-sale cases in the Rarible platform:\nWhen the NFT is sold originally, Minty Fresh gets 1% of the sale price\n\n### Funding Milestones and Payments\n- Milestone 1: User flow between all the screens of the app. Design of the app. Done in Figma. Deliverable: Figma design link including prototype\n- Milestone 2: Working with Rarible devs of creating a working link between the Rarible protocol and swift templates of the openAPI. Prepare the backend for the iOS developer. Splash screen and login with wallet ready. Deliverable: Testflight download with features listed in the milestone\n- Milestone 3: More features added to the Testflight. Create NFT, upload image/video, set NFT info (name, description, properties) Pay minting fee/gas fee, set royalty percentage, deliver NFT to rarible.com, “View your NFTs” gallery. Deliverable: Testflight download with features listed in the milestone\n- Milestone 4: Development of the iOS app. Iterations and back-and-forth. Push the app to the iOS app store. Deliverable: App store download with features listed in the milestones above\n\nTotal project time: 5-7 weeks after commencement of the project.\n\nEach milestone will be inspected upon completion by the multisig holders to confirm the payments. Payment schedule:\n- Milestone 1: $5,000\n- Milestone 2: $10,000\n- Milestone 3: $10,000\n- Milestone 4: $10,000\nTotal payment: $35,000\n\nPayment will be delivered to the following wallet:\nETH wallet: 0xf01e6A7aC4eB5C7b5DFa0B849AeA95987745a52c\n### Use of funds\nFunds will be used to hire an iOS developer full time, a junior designer, QA expert for testing and a project manager for 5 hours/week for the duration of the project.\n### Team Members\n- Chris Seline, CEO - Linkedin. Chris is a serial tech entrepreneur who has founded 3 prior startups, 2 funded and one exit. He has 22 years of software development experience.\n- Ari Tomasson, COO - Linkedin. Ari has extensive experience in startup business development forming partnerships with blue chip tech and entertainment companies e.g. Google and NBC as well as running a software agency for the last 4 years.\n- Darri Ulfsson, Head of Product - Linkedin. Darri has a decade of experience designing multiple digital products of the highest quality showcasing world class level artists.\n- Black Math, Branding, strategy, product design & more. Black Math is a creative firm, self-proclaimed crypto enthusiasts. - blackmath.com 1\n\nThe contact person for this project will be Ari. Their contact information is ari@darkblock.io and their Discord handle is arito#6681.\n### Accountability\nOur team members will attend weekly community calls and dev calls, and provide updates on our milestones as we make progress. In the event that we can’t fulfil our commitment, funds will be returned to Rarible DAO. We will also work with community members to ensure updates are distributed through the Rarible communication channels.\n### Why should Rarible DAO fund this?\nWe believe that Minty Fresh will be the entry point for a big new class of NFT creators. Social media stars and influencers are used to create on their phone and leverage their creations for an income.\nNFTs will be a nice new revenue stream for them that they can sell directly to their superfans and Rarible will be their home base.\nInfluencers are hurting right now due to loss of revenue connected to the Covid-19 virus and they will jump on the chance to broaden their revenue streams.\n\n",

      "content": "link to forum post: https://gov.rarible.com/t/collector-daos-with-rarible-boost-on-daohaus/13023\n\n### TL;DR\nNFT creator, collector, and curator DAOs are gaining a lot of attention right now. This proposal is to build a native interface on the DAOhaus platform to interact with the Rarible protocol.\n\n### Problem / Opportunity\nCollecting NFTs with friends through a DAO presents a new opportunity for engagement between creators and collectors within the NFT space. It would allow people across the globe to participate with each other in the creation of and hunt for hidden NFT gems and the next amazing NFT drop.\n\nBecause members of a DAO would coordinate together to find these precious tokens, they would work as a curation team and build their reputation as quality NFT hunters.\n\nOn the other side of this market are creator teams; artist co-op DAOs are gaining increased popularity, and the use case for blockchain governance is clear. It is a strong use case because creators know the power of network effects, and they know that artists who build together win together!\n\nThe opportunity here is that a native integration would lower coordination costs and improve user experience. DAOs will form specifically to collect NFTs using the Rarible minting & marketplace protocol.\n\nDAOhaus is a community-centric DAO platform that allows various communities and organizations to deploy their own DAO with little overhead and modularity.\n\nThe platform itself is managed by a DAO that has built the first DAO2DAO ‘super dao’ under the name UberHaus. If Rarible passes a Grant proposal like this, it is likely that UberHaus will match it. This would insure that the needed resources are in place to make building and shipping the integration quick!\n\nMinty is a platform to build, operate, and fund NFT DAOs with a community of collectors and investors. We are contributing to, and funding open source development of the core tech needed to launch community governed NFT collections.\n\n### Funding Milestones and Payments\n#### Milestones & payments:\n#### Phase 1:\n- Research on feasibility of the Boost with testnets(kovan) and EVM sidechains (xDAI/polygon), get user feedback on the use case. Spec initial design with Figma prototype. explore rarible protocol api and contracts.\nResearch impact on DAO RQ dynamics when the DAO holds non-divisible tokens. Consider both share buyouts and fractionalization.\n- Research application of AMB to govern & hold NFTs on different chains/ layer 2\n- User interviews and feedback, dao community outreach and engagement\n- Engage initial communities that want to use and test initial project\nWork has begun on this and a demo was given to the Rarible Governance Team\n\n*Phase 1 Deliverable: Working figma prototype, documentation of reseach and user testing.\n\n\n#### Phase 2 (Rarible Collector DAOs):\n- Design sprint around native integration; allow DAOs to buy, bid, sell and display ownership in a DAO gallery.\n- Allow DAO members a way to exit the DAO with their fair share of the holdings\n- Full technical sprint for Minion/Boost support of Rarible protocol on mainnet and applicable sidechains\n\n*Phase 2 Deliverable Technical sprint and further implementation plan, Dao contract extensions for nft ‘vault’, buyouts, and new membership with nft tribute\n\n#### Phase 3 (Creator DAO):\n- Implement the front end gallery, and all needed functionality in the app through the Rarible DAO Boost.\n\n*Phase 3 Deliverable ship working app and onboard initial DAO communities.\nfuture development\n\n#### Future development\n- Have a minting interface and further built out Rarible ‘shop’\n- NFT appraisal integration to help DAOs value their collections & share prices\n\n### Payments\n(payments on mainnet in USD equivalent RARI)\n- Phase 1: 5k\n- Phase 2: 20k\n- Phase 3: 20k\nfuture dev will have a new spec and proposal\n\nPayments will be made to the following Ethereum address:\n0x3Be7264F5b60635F434559Ab4abc839958768cF2\n\nWe consider ourselves independent contractors of the Rarible DAO and will report taxes accordingly. Forms W8-BEN and W9 will be filled out accordingly before funds get distributed to our team.

      "title": "Design a JS SDK for Rarible protocol",
      "content": "\n## TLDR: Design a JS SDK for Rarible protocol\nThis is a proposal to begin work on the architecture, design, and dev experience for a JS SDK of the entire Rarible Protocol Flow. This interface will be used by developers to quickly integrate the protocol into their apps, while abstracting most of the complex logic that can happen under the hood.\n\nIn one week we’ll thoroughly digest existing resources and documentation, work along side other ecosystem developers, prepare the interface for the protocol according to the feedback received, and specify all the endpoints that would be created on a subsequent engagement.\n\n## Problem / Opportunity\nThe Rarible Protocol currently does not have an official SDK, so by having this dev tool ready it will be easier for dApp devs to interact with Rarible protocol.\n\ndOrg DAO is specialized in building Web3 integrations and tooling, and various of our stake holders are interested in building on top of the Rarible. By creating this SDK, high-caliber projects will be able to tap into the protocol to develop their specific NFT usecases.\n\n## Funding Milestones and Payments\nThe following is an estimate based on the scope of work as currently understood and can change upon revision by mutual consent of the parties.\n\n#### Estimated Timeframe: 1 week\n#### Deliverables: Research & Interface (~50 hours)\n- Architecture: Initial interface for the protocol, covering the entire Rarible Protocol Flow, which covers the following: Creating ERC721/1155 Asset Metadata and Calling the Mint function, Asset Discovery, Creating a sell order, Accepting a buyer/bid order, Order Discovery, Matching Order, Updating/Canceling an order, API Reference\n- Work with other ecosystem developers to best polish the end-user’s experience\n- Describe the development roadmap for a subsequent engagement to develop the SDK.\n\nWe can think of this interface as the set of specifications that describe the inputs, outputs, and behaviors of all the functional elements of the Protocol Flow. Therefore, the engagement involves architecture, conceptualization, and analysis so that the protocol can be abstracted into something robust that you can easily interact with.\nFor illustration purposes, if we were to design an interface for a microwave, we’d deliver the specification of each of the “buttons” to set cooking time, start, stop, set mode(heat, defrost), etc. Consequently, the details of how the microwave increases the temperature of your food, turns on the lightbulb when you start it, or rotates the microwave dish would not be part of the interface itself, and they’d be developed on future engagements considering the proposed roadmap.\nOnce the SDK fully built, its implementation will look like the two code snippets we’ve posted above on this thread.\nThe snippet code below is an accurate representation of what a part of the deliverable interface would look like.\ntype Metadata = {\n  name: string;\n  description: string;\n  image: Blob;\n  external: string;\n  animation: Blob;\n  attributes: {\n    key: string;\n    trait_type: string;\n    value: string;\n  }[];\n};\n \ntype Address = string;\n \ntype AccountPercentage = {\n  account: Address;\n  value: number;\n};\n \ninterface RaribleSDK {\n  constructor(config: {\n    ethereum: EthereumProvider;\n    api: APIProvider;\n    subgraph: SubgraphProvider;\n  }): void;\n \n  mint(\n    to: Address,\n    metadata: Metadata,\n    creators: AccountPercentage[],\n    royalties: AccountPercentage,\n    signatures: string[]\n  ): LazyMintResult;\n \n  mint(\n    to: Address,\n    metadata: Metadata,\n    creators: AccountPercentage[],\n    royalties: AccountPercentage,\n    signatures: string[],\n    lazy: false\n  ): MintResult;\n}\n\nFinally, for comparison of what to expect as a tangible interface deliverable for this first phase, here is OpenSea’s SDK Interface: https://github.com/ProjectOpenSea/opensea-js/blob/84a4e811e020e98945749157075514047079bc72/lib/seaport.d.ts#L6\n\n### Payment terms\n6K USD equivalent. 20% will be paid upon delivery in RARI on xDAI, the remaining will be paid in DAI via the escrow service on xDAI. The escrow payment will be made using RaidGuild’s new SmartInvoice. \n \ndOrg LLC will be a service provider of the Rarible DAO and will report taxes accordingly. Legally compliant invoices will be issued accordingly before funds get distributed to our team.\n- Registered Legal Entity: dOrg LLC\n- Registered Address: 76 St. Paul St, PO Box 369, Burlington, VT 05402\n- Tax ID: 84-2930500\n\n### Use of funds\nFunds will be used to pay experienced developers and builders from dOrg DAO (https://dorg.tech). RARI token will be used to pay builders directly involved with the project, and 10% of the total amount will be airdropped to dOrg DAO Reputation Holders.\n### Team Members\ndOrg is a Web3 Developer DAO that has worked with top projects like Balancer, The Graph, Aragon, Badger, Gnosis, ParaSwap, and more.\nThe project will initially be executed by the following dOrg members. However, dOrg is designed to flexibly bring on the right expertise at the right time, so other developers will likely get involved over time.\n#### Roberto Henríquez (Media#2944) - PM\n#### Carlos Febres (carlosfebres#8099) - Full Stack\n#### Ben Walker (benefacto19#4368) - Web3 Integrations\n### Accountability & Quality Assurance\ndOrg utilizes the following processes to keep all parties accountable in the course of execution:\n- Project Manager is responsible for keeping the project on track and should be interfaced through for any issues regarding scope, roadmap, risk, payments, etc.\n- Weekly Syncs to share updates, discuss blockers, and realign priorities.\n- Discord Channel for ongoing updates and support\n- Github Project Board for continuous deliverable tracking\n- Feedback Threads to asynchronously collect community feedback as we build\n\nIn order to ensure that all deliverables satisfy project requirements without issue, dOrg:\n- Carefully assigns proven builders with the relevant expertise\n- Utilizes modern testing frameworks and testnet lifecycle simulation\n- Performs internal code reviews before handoff and other key milestones\nDespite these efforts, dOrg is not able guarantee that all code will be perfect. Web3 is still an emerging field with a high level of risk and complexity. dOrg is not responsible for any bugs or technical failures that may result from its services. The Client is responsible for consulting with the relevant security experts before taking high risk systems live.\n### Why should Rarible DAO fund this?\nWhat is the benefit to RARI token holders? How will this help grow the ecosystem, or bring value to them?\nWe believe that, in Web3, improvements to the developer experience drive ecosystem growth. With more teams able to build fast and prototype on top of the protocol, we’ll be able to see even wider adoption and innovation.\nWe need an SDK; By abstracting the complex logic of the protocol (ExchangeV2, IPFS pinning, API calls, Test environments, etc) devs will be able build on top of a simple, intuitive interface.\nWe will support ecosystem cross-pollination and distribute protocol stakeholdership to a group of awesome Web3 Specialists by airdropping 10% of the RARI token received to the 50+ members of the dOrg DAO.\n\n\n",

We would like your help. Back in 2018 we made the first phone app that allowed people to make NFTs Recently our app has exploded in popularity. We went from 1 install a month in 2018 to 400+ installs a day and 10,000+ installs in March 2021. We’re also the #1 search result for NFT and NFTs in the Apple store and #3 in Android. Although popular we still don’t have much money and a very small team. Due to the limitations of the Apple store we’re not allowed to have a direct marketplace between users. To solve this we implemented the OpensSea API to give our users somewhere to sell. The problem with OpenSea is it’s very expensive and has a lot of limitations. Instead want to allow our users to conduct all marketplace transactions through the Rarible protocol. In addition we will display Rarible Protocol NFTs in public search in the app. Doing this will drive thousands of users to the Rarible protocol each month and gain exposure for Rarible user NFTs.\n\n## The problem\nOur users want cheaper and better market functionality.\n\n## Funding Requested\n$20,000 USD equivalent (50% upon passing, 50% upon delivery)\nETH Address: 0x6c474099ad6d9Af49201a38b9842111d4ACd10BC\n\n## How the funds will be used\n85% Development (2 Developers)\n15% Marketing (Press Release and Paid Advertisement)\n\n## Additionally\nBecause we have a unique situation of having our own smart contracts we will be a test case for integrating existing NFT smart contracts specifically ERC1155 into the Rarible protocol utilizing order discovery, order matching, buy orders, sell orders, asset discovery, royalties features. We will document the entire process and work closely with the community to ensure that other minting platforms will be able to successfully and smoothly integrate with the Rarible protocol.\n\n## Milestones\n1 - 1.5 Months. NFTs in the app will be sellable, buyable and discoverable on the Rarible protocol.\n\n## Team\nNicholas Juntilla, Software Engineer, CEO\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/nicholasjuntilla/ 3\n\nChris Seckler, Software Engineer, CTO\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/chrisseckler/\n\nMasha Edelen, Software Engineer, Product Design, CFO\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/mashaedelen/ 2\n\n## Submitted by\nNicholas Juntilla @Nick - Ownerfy#8137\n\n## Accountability\nNick J will attend community meetings and give status and progress updates as well as be in communication with his Rarible via the development channel and team contact, Eric Aresenault. Upon completion he will deliver an integration document outlining the process, feedback, and details.\n\n",

      "content": "What?\nAn artist residency for the digital world, stewarding artists to the cybercommons while co-creating sustainable models of engagement and exploring NFT creation as new media praxis.\n\nWhy?\nThe NFT scene is currently going through a hype cycle in which rapid growth and speculation bring newcomers – and new money – at the cost of unsustainable practices and misaligned incentives. Supply is currently growing faster than demand and misinformation are rampant, but we see this residency as an opportunity to draw from previous networks to create support for artists in the space.\n\nHow?\nDoD has developed a new residency that sets out to help with onboarding, educating and assisting new artists to become more active in the cryptoart and NFT community.\n\n- Support network and market advisory\n- Community guidance and network building assistance\n- Introduce new artists to collectors, curators, and other stakeholders inside the community\n- Subsidized ETH gas fees\n- Carbon consciousness\n\nWho?\nThe residency will be lead by DoD (Stina Gustafsson, Beth McCarthy, María Paula Fernández), which has selected various advisors from diverse backgrounds for an interdisciplinary board:\n\n- Vanessa Grellet\n- Aude Launay\n- Elizabeth Johs\n- Anne Bracegirdle\n- Mara Schmidt\n- Offsetra\n\nPilot\n- We will focus on the Rarible platform, as it is permissionless and open to proposals, diverse and already populated\n- Demand in Rarible has plateaued or concentrated and there are many artists needing guidance\n- We are asking for 3 ETH from the Rarible DAO to subsidize gas fees + extra for carbon offset for the artists. All funds from grants proposal will go to artist subsidies\n\nFuture\n- Aim to work with IRL residencies and act as a bridge between IRL and URL\n- Work with unrepresented minorities\n- Cross platform work\n- Offer different tracks for participating artists - for example environmental, NFT as IP design, or rethinking exhibition practices\n- Commissions\n- Set up a DAO to manage the funds\n- Expand to non crypto native artists / onboard new creatives",

Our group has writers, graphic designers, animators, programmers, illustrators, game devs, geeks, crazy people and more. Artwork is literally our day job!\n\nWe do not intend to implement every one of these changes, so the mods can choose the best ones and make them available as convenient.\n\n1. Notifications!!! please have a better way to show notifications when someone follows me and likes my posts!\n\n2. Please create a space for DMs, People are doing it on twitter so why not just do it on Rarible.\n\n3. The cover image does not automatically switch size between tablet, phone and desktop. So some pages end up looking weird on some platforms. \n\n4. When uploading the picture their is a mistake 'updating' is spelt 'updading'\n(I am sorry if I am knitpicking but c'mon are'nt we trying to improve the platform?!!!)\n\n5. Check out our previous suggestion and think about making the verification faster for the reasons mentioned earlier. https://snapshot.org/#/rarible/proposal/QmYSV5A3p8ZuKs9GNmC6dwRDNut9xZzumTnnggnkH9Lcrw\n\n6. Have clear instructions for new artists. Let them know that unless they are not verified their artwork will not be displayed and they will not feature on the homepage nor will they pop up via search\n\nIf you read this far thank you for your time. Please vote!\n\nCheckout rawrnft.com for our NFTs",

      "content": "Governance forum link: https://gov.rarible.com/t/updated-proposal-building-rarible-ecosystem-block-by-block/9593\nETH address: to be posted in the forum.\n\nAs Rarible Scribe (over the past few weeks), Creator, Forum Contributor, and Licensed Community Member (Trust Level 2) – I would like to propose the following value to the Rarible DAO & Community.\n\nMy Background\n\nI don’t like talking about myself (it makes me uncomfortable), but in this scenario, experience matters. You can learn more about me here 1.\n\nTLDR: I’ve been an entrepreneur since 2006 and have failed more times than I have succeeded. I know what it is like to live very lean, I have also been fortunate enough to achieve some wins and know the thrill that comes with it. During my entrepreneurial journey, (3) of my startups have had successful exits with (1) exit to a public company (NASDAQ: RP). My first involvement with cryptocurrency was in 2014. From this position I parlayed the resources to fund my current venture studio specializing in FinTech, AI, Blockchain, and Gaming startups.\n\nThe most rewarding work I do is helping other entrepreneurs succeed.\n\nNew Update April 19, 2021\n\nSince this proposal was submitted, (2) additional contributors have joined this initiative. They will be stakeholders in this going forward (@MincentmanGogh and @knowledgeable_idiot) and their contribution is both welcomes and highly valued.\n\nOur Plan To Serve Rarible DAO & Community\n\nTo scale the Rarible marketplace faster and more efficiently than any other marketplace, we need a dedicated focus on standardizing processes and simplifying community friction. This will be an iterative process that I believe starts with focusing on the Rarible ecosystem. Success of this ecosystem is mission critical to achieving this.\n\nWe would like to start by operating as Ambassadors of the Rarible community who will collaborate with entrepreneurs and visionaries of accepted and pending ecosystem projects in the following ways:\n\nBelow is a brief outline of the value provided.\n\nProject Advocacy: operate as your project/proposal resource and take on the responsibility of being your internal champion to the community. Share with our community the projects high-level vision. Transmit that value to the community beyond the governance calls through journalistic content, email, forums, and social media (when applicable). Spread the good news.\nSpecific deliverables for accountability are:\n\n• (1) Forum post bi-weekly for the community on noteworthy updates from current projects.\n• (1) Forum post weekly updating community with summary of Rarible Governance Call.\n• (1) Forum post weekly updating community with summary of Rarible Developer Call.\n• Create social media launch assets projects can use to announce project delivery (1) IG Post/Story, (1) Twitter, (1) Discord/Web.\n\nProject Accountability/Delivery: collect and consolidate updates of each project to the community by connecting with active project stakeholders in the Rarible ecosystem.\nSpecific deliverables are:\n\n• Create and maintain updated spreadsheet to track proposals and deliverables.\n• Data input includes project/proposal name, timeline, delivery date status, payment received.\n• Develop a window to this data with a publicly accessible URL that visualizes statuses for the entire community \n\nFuture state this consolidated information will allow the community to setup badge/rewards framework (like in forum) that gives recognition to group accomplishments and successful project delivery history.\n\nAnything early-stage means community feedback is important to iterate on-going.\n\nThe Ask\n\nMonthly $5,000 USD (equivalent in $RARI) payments based on DAO (CY Budget) of ~$30MM.\n\nScope of contribution and service represents 10-15 hours of work commensurate with current active proposal/project volume. That is expected to increase overtime. Would ask to revisit allocation when workload doubles. We will continue to provide value on behalf of the Rarible Community for the next 2 months and reassess at the end of that period.\n\nWe will supply Rarible DAO with Form W-9 or other applicable tax forms to an agent of Rarible DAO to confirm I am not subject to backup tax withholding in any applicable jurisdiction. My compensation may be reported on Form 1099-MISC or another applicable tax form by an agent of Rarible DAO.\n\nWhy Fund This\n\nAs the community grows, the Rarible DAO members availability and community cognitive thresholds to consider proposals will decrease. Standardized ecosystem processes that simplify understanding and expedite project value to the community must start taking form now. I believe in Rarible and can help partner with community projects by being hyper-focused on the value creation processes and the mechanics that drive organic growth.\n\nWhether this proposal gets accepted or not, consider the offer herein to be available to anyone that’s part of the Rarible Community.\n\nThank you.",

Our group has writers, graphic designers, animators, programmers, illustrators, game devs, geeks, crazy people and more. We have created a universe of characters that turn buying, selling and bidding on NFTs into a game and all of our characters come with their own lore/story\nWe also update the lore of the universe on our website and instagram rawrnft.com\n\nNow, I believe that small groups of creators or individuals entering the business with rarible find it difficult to sell on the platform due to authenticity doubts. And while we firmly believe that verification is necessary due to alot of fakes using the platform to replicate others' works. We believe that it acts as a disincentive when the creator has to wait several weeks or even months before getting verified. \n\nIf the work is original then verification is a right. I also understand that this platform needs maintain scarcity and by verifying everyone, it will lose it somehow but we can up with other tags for that. \n\nLike I said its difficult to sell when we look fake despite how much efforts we exert on social media. \n\nAnother point to consider is that many groups pay a good deal of money to post on Rarible. In our case the total cost of making 9 NFTs was about 1k-1.5k. When considering how much work goes into our projects. We have a 3d dragon for gods sake!\n\nRarible could potentially lose good creators to other platforms who might consider a move when the verification takes so long. In order to make this the best community out there, we need to incentivize new creators who produce original works\n\nIf you read this far, thank you for your time. ",

      "content": "\nThe original proposal is subdivided into two ideas: \n\nIdea 1.\nRarible DAO invests funds (in $RARI) to distribute tokens amongst those investors who contribute the financials resources for the Uniswap pools. This reward is highly dependent on the total amount of RARI owned by the recipient.\n\nIdea 2.\nMoreover, liquidity holders would have an option to participate in platform’s live, i.e. by voting and offering new ideas. Also, the user may freeze its own tokens in liquidity pools to indicate its commitment to participate in the platform, obtain tokens and get rewards from the DAO community.\n\nThe working principle:\n->  The formulas we created for staking are great for the reward distribution as they consider most of the leading factors and represent the user's activeness numerically with decent accuracy.\n->  Formula system:\nThe formulas are described in the following document:\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1W6PpRnALfMZi3m2dAhvfCt7uEJTODs3vo5YWGDJ7p-Y/edit\n->  The period for which the user has its tokens frozen is also taken into account by the system: the longer it is - the more perks will be gifted.\n->  The realization involves a special Python code which would display users who have their RARI tokens in the liquidity pools and calculate a reward for those who suit the conditions. This would allow me to become one of the leaders in platform’s growth and development.\nI would like to be given a 200 RARI grant for this project.\n\n\n\nExpected results for Rarible:\n\n->  This idea applies to all active participants in the platform.\n->  The formulas are easy to understand for most of the community as they are represented by a linear function.\n->  The two ideas are combined making coding it almost effortless.\n->  Considering not only those who keep tokens on their account, but also users having tokens in the liquidity pools.\n->  The key source of growth for the NFT sector as well as for Rarible is the flow of new users interested in obtaining NFT tokens. Thus, this addon would draw attention to the creation of collections and to the system in general.\n->  This idea considers all the factors of the recent proposal: \nhttps://gov.rarible.com/t/proposal-for-phase-2-of-rr2/8470\n\nWelcome to share your thoughts:\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1s5ITIUh_hGCuuYPyxlBw1sIrAPHyZheXwP70krw2Zi8/edit#",

      "content": "Forum Post: https://gov.rarible.com/t/my-proposal-to-work-for-rarible-dao/9477/2\nWallet Address: 0xA873d064bdf7dEF5787b5D06aCDEb3A9f08b64B3\n\nLast month, I spoke to Alex and Alexei and offered my services to help Rarible DAO and the ecosystem surrounding the Rarible Protocol come to life. One of the terms of this engagement was that I did not want to work for Rarible corp., instead wanting to work as part of the community (Rarible DAO). As such, below is my proposal to offer my services to Rarible DAO, to help build the rocket ship we are strapping ourselves to.\n\nMy Background\n\nYou can take a look at my work background https://www.linkedin.com/in/eric-arsenault-3b86b026/ if interested.\n\nTLDR: I’ve been an entrepreneur full time since 2014, and likely one of the first people to be working full time for DAOs in the Ethereum ecosystem. Over the last two years, I’ve been working with teams to design, build, and launch DAOs and incentivizing behavior in communities, while navigating the regulatory terrain. I’ve also been fortunate enough to join Venture DAO, and work with other leaders in the space to deploy capital to early projects, including individuals such as Ameen, Staani, and Pet3r among many others.\n\nHow I plan to serve Rarible DAO\n\nGrowing the “Rarible ecosystem” is perhaps one the most important roles in the company right now as Rarible moves from being a single successful product to an ecosystem of projects. Below includes some of my main proposed responsibilities\n\n-Recruiting teams to build on the Rarible protocol, and helping them navigate the DAO landscape\n-Helping projects succeed by connecting them with others and helping them meet their capital needs\n-Recruiting an amazing team to service Rarible DAO operational needs and growth efforts, and helping coordinate these efforts\n-Being the representative and point person for the Rarible <> Rarible DAO relationship\n-Advise and steer the decentralization process, ensure governance risks are properly dealt with\n\nOver the last few weeks, I’ve been aggressively moving things forward on this front and we are just only getting started. In addition to these duties, I will join the Rarible DAO multisig as a Council member. I believe that this effort is central to Rarible growing into one of the largest and most valuable ecosystems in the Ethereum space, which I fully think we can do.\n\nMy Ask\n\n-Monthly $10,000 USD (equivalent in $RARI) payments. As a comparable, Synthetix DAO pays core DAO members ~20K / month equivalent https://blog.synthetix.io/the-spartan-council-election/.\n-35,000 $RARI vested linearly over 2 years in even monthly installments to ensure long term alignment. This 2 year period will begin after an initial 1 year period without any vesting tokens. This roughly represents 1% of circulating supply, or roughly 0.14% of total supply. As a point of reference for startups, see this article: https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/09/deciding-how-much-equity-to-give-your-key-employees/. Vesting will be subject to my continuous service representing at least 20 hours of work on behalf of the Rarible DAO per week and will cease upon the first to occur of: (a) my death or resignation; or (b) the termination of my service through the approval of a termination proposal by the Rarible DAO.\n-I will consider myself an “independent contractor” of the Rarible DAO and will report my taxes accordingly. I will supply a Form W-9, Form W-8BEN or other applicable tax forms to an agent of Rarible DAO to confirm I am not subject to backup tax withholding in any applicable jurisdiction. My compensation may be reported on Form 1099-MISC or another applicable tax form by an agent of Rarible DAO.\n\nWhy fund this\n\nRarible is in a unique position in the crypto space, but the market is incredibly competitive, and we need to attract nothing but the best as part of our ecosystem growth efforts. This proposal should be seen as an investment, that should benefit the entire Rarible ecosystem should I accomplish what I’m setting our to do. With your support, I will lead the transition from Rarible being a cool product with a reward token, to being a thriving interconnected ecosystem of projects. I look forward to working with you all to bring this to reality.",

I’m sure there are many of you out there that have experienced that. But I’ve also found that it can also be difficult to know exactly where one should even begin. As a newer member to the space I’ve had my share of rabbit holes, difficulties, and headaches. The CRC would help alleviate that by diligently working to unearth and create opportunities and make them known and accessible to interested artists.\n\nBackground:\n\nFor over 20 years I have been a Digital + Analog Arts Educator and Graphic Designer. I have worked with various art centers, STEM Programs, art collectives, community arts projects, and Brand liaison. I’m passionate about creating connections and finding opportunities that will help the Rarible community worldwide.\n\nAccountability:\n\nWe would be working closely with the Rarible team. Attend weekly community calls to provide status updates and opportunities. Post project/opportunity updates regularly. Facilitate discussions on discord. Weekly email overview.\n\nTimeframe: TBD\n\nBudget Requested: 70 $RARI for the first pilot project to the following address: 0x8b7c37671f37Db95e9d84714f7A4464d552aa0EA",

      "title": "Make custom NFT sites and marketplaces",
      "content": "Summary\n\nLaunch a simple site builder that lets creators easily make their own custom NFT site and marketplaces using the new Rarible protocol.\n\nOverview\n\nAs more people join the NFT digital renaissance, minting new NFTs and adding them to marketplaces, it becomes increasingly important for creators to differentiate through unique shops and branding. Right now, the only way to create your own custom NFT site or marketplace is by building it from scratch. This is time-consuming and requires coding expertise. While there are many no code site or shop builders out there, they are not crypto native, they become gatekeepers to any NFT integrations, and are almost impossible to set up for an NFT shop.\n\nWe are building a simple NFT site builder that lets you create your own custom NFT shop or marketplace. You can mint new NFTs, display existing NFTs, and sell directly from your own site. You can customize the look of your site without code. Or, if you want to code something completely custom, you can add your own HTML/CSS/JS. The NFTs that you minted from your site would be automatically added to open marketplaces such as Rarible.\n\nBeing a crypto native site builder, we can later experiment with more ownership and crowdfunding ideas, integrate with useful projects in the ecosystem to allow features like gated content, access to private groups, messaging with collectors. And allow community ownership so that each site owner is incentivized to support and promote each other. So that we can be individuals, together.\n\nWho are we?\n\nWe are @ohjia 2 and @gleuch 2––designers and developers who have worked on projects like Ethernal (a fully decentralized dungeon crawler on Ethereum), Know Your Meme (first community-led meme archive), and Poncho (a cat that tells you the weather), as well as experience in e-commerce sites and platforms.\n\nWe are looking to work with more people. If you want to DM us on Twitter!\n\nOur proposal\n\nLaunch Picnic v1:\n\nGenerate a site by connecting your wallet, choose a theme, add content and publish the site.\nAdd new assets to mint via lazy or traditional minting.\nDashboard for minting and displaying NFTs (NFTs for sale, minted NFTs, and NFTs you own) using the new Rarible protocol features.\nFunding\n\n1500 $RARI upfront, 1500 $RARI upon launch of v1. Funds will be sent to: 0xb9701545E7bf1c75f949C01DB12c0e23aADA752a\n\nUse of funds\n\nsoftware services and scalable infrastructure costs\nhire additional contract developer and designer\nincentive and marketing for the launch\nAccountability\n\nWe are working closely with the Rarible team to better utilize the Rarible protocol. We will provide updates on our progress on weekly calls and through bi-weekly newsletters. Also, half of the funding upon completion incentivizes us to release within our timeline. Our plan is to release in May.\n\nThe future\n\nThere are a lot of possibilities for a customizable NFT site builder.\n\nWe plan to develop a Picnic token that would be distributed to site owners and allow them to propose and vote on features and integrations. The token would also be distributed to contributors for designing more themes as well as to the Rarible DAO to continue aligning our incentives.\n\nPotential integrations with projects in the ecosystem:\n\nENS support and subdomains\nCollab.land for accessing private groups\nMintgate for unlocking links\nand more…\nA marketplace for themes, so that we can tap into the creativity of the community, have more unique designs, and give creators another revenue stream.\n\nWhy fund this\n\nSince NFTs have become mainstream, more people are launching their NFTs or marketplaces and are looking for a way to differentiate themselves and create their own unique sites & communities. By creating an easy-to-use NFT site builder, we give emerging creators and brands alike the tools to take advantage of the new Rarible protocol and bring more people into the Rarible community.",

      "content": "TL;DR : Royalties system is broken. Radical protocol implements Harberger, an economic design that allow NFT creator to earn streamed passive income, paid by current NFT holder, on his creations. This was posted on the governance forum here: https://gov.rarible.com/t/grant-application-radical-nft-generate-life-long-income-on-your-nfts/8663\n\nProblem : NFTs are boring\n\nWhile NFT re-defines the concept of property, the economic mechanisms attached to it belong to the past.\nMint your NFT and perceive upfront payment for its sale. That’s all. We were already doing this with shells thousands years ago.\nAt best, you could expect royalties on future sales without any certitude on the frequency and amount of those hypothetic incomes.\nThose royalties are technically badly implemented.\n\nSolution : Harberger as the layer base of the NFT economy\n\nRadical protocol allows NFT creator and collectors to mint Radical NFT and collect patronage on top of it.\n\n(1) Radicalize your content.\n\nMint a Radical NFT on Radical protocol\nAfter minting, creator get 2 tokens : the radical token and the patronage token.\nHe will most of the time sell the radical token and keep the patronage.\n→ The radical is the property token. It is used like a classic NFT (Flex with it on ShowTime, add the piece to your Crypto Voxel land, etc).\n\nAs soon as user holds this token, he needs to list it on a NFT marketplace. This token will always be for sale.\nThe radical price he attributes is the instant buy price. At any time someone can buy the token for this amount. He will get 100% of the sale price.\nThe radical owner needs to pay a patronage on this radical token. The patronage is a fixed percentage - set initially by NFT creator.\nThe patronage is streamed continuously from radical owner to patronage collector.\n→ The patronage token is the patronage collector token.\n\nPatronage owner collects the streamed income paid by radical owner.\nThe patronage amount is shared :\n80% of the patronage is collected by patronage owner\n10% is collected by Radical DAO.\n10% is distributed to previous NFT collectors. This distribution follows a bonding curve. The sooner you collect the token, the bigger your patronage shares.\n\nie : Bob mint a radical NFT with 10% patronage rate.\nHe lists the radical token (available on all marketplaces) at 10 ETH ; and keep the patronage.\nAlice buys the token at 10 ETH.\nAlice owns the radical and list it at an instant buy price of 20 ETH.\nAlice pays 2 ETH per year to Bob.\n\n(2) Manage your patronage and radical tokens.\n\nInteract with radical smart contract via our app or any NFT marketplaces ; mint, buy, change radical price, deposit patronage provision, claim patronage.\nCollect the tastier radical and patronage tokens.\nWe got 3 certitudes that guide the way we build :\n\nNFT creator will always want to generate larger passive income from their activity\nNFT collector will always want to generate larger passive income from their activity\nNFT economy needs to be built by a proper DAO\nBenefits\n\nFor NFT creators :\n\nLife long passive income on their creations\nStreamed income\nFlexibility between (1) massive upfront payment & light annual income or (2) modest upfront payment & massive life long income (depending of patronage rate selected)\nFor NFT collectors :\n\nLife long passive income for previous investments\nTeam\n\nWe are a passionate, complementary team.

A whole new class of assets minted and traded on the app\n\n30% of our future gov token is given to the Rarible treasury + $RARI holders.\n\nWe mint Radical and Patronage tokens on Rarible\n\nRadical and patronage tokens are listed and can be traded on Rarible\n→ The UX related to buying a Radical NFT is different from buying a classic NFT. We will support Rarible in technical and design integration ; NPM package, technical documentation, etc.\n\nWe integrate a CTA to the Rarible page of the creator wallet (Previous work, average price, twitter verification, social dimension) on our app.\n\nThere is no competition between Radicle and Rarible.\nRarible is the leader of NFT minting and trading industry, we will be the one of the Harberger economy layer base.\n\nWhat we are waiting from Rarible ? Skin in our game\n\nGrant of $40k, used that way :\n→ 10k for graphic identity\n→ 15k for smart contract deployment and technical review\n→ 15k for builders\nProduct and partnership exposition\n\nGrant details :\n\nThe builders grant is vested vested : $5k released at beginning ; $5k at mid journey ; $5k at alpha release. The rest is issued at the beginning.\nWe engage to be represented and provide summary of our progress during Rarible calls.\nThis oral summary will be competed by a written summary published behind this proposal.\nWe are confident to have a functional alpha reviewed and released at day 70.\nThe wallet address to send funds to will be posted in the governance forum.\n\nTokenomics :\n\nTo be disclosed\n\nWe consider ourselves “independent contractors” of the Rarible DAO and will report taxes accordingly.",

      "title": "Mystery Drop Integration",
      "content": "Forum link: https://gov.rarible.com/t/draft-proposal-mystery-drop-platform-integration-into-rarible/6339/2\n\n**Overview**\n\nMystery Drop enables creators such as artists and musicians, to sell a collection of NFTs before revealing the artwork. This feature enables new drop dynamics that creators can leverage to engage with their audience. The primary use case for Mystery Drop is NFT box breaks, where people can buy into a ‘pack’ of NFTs and watch the artist unveil them in real time on a live stream. Mystery Drop uses the Rarible collection smart contract to mint the NFTs and integrate with other NFT protocols like NFTX.\n\nMystery Drop was developed at the EthGlobal NFTHack.\n\n- 3rd place winner of Rarible sponsor prize\n- 2nd place winner of NFTX sponsor prize\n- Submission, demo video & source code: https://hack.ethglobal.co/showcase/mysterydrop-recnAaH5hHt2oH656\n- https://www.mysterydrop.app\n\nThe market has already shown interest in curated collections or boxes of NFTs, like the ones that are released by Pranksy on NFT Boxes\n\n**How Mystery Drop works**\n\n*For an artist*\n\n1. Select media supported by Rarible to be included in the drop\n2. Fill out the description, upload a cover image for their drop & upload the artwork to a private portal. Media is private and can only be viewable by artist/creator. This allows the platform to run scripts and generate the NFTs\nSelect the terms of the box (random redemption, lock-up period, etc)\n3. Mint the box\n4. Share link with with their communities and the greater metaverse.\n5. While streaming online with Twitch or similar platform, the creator unlocks the packs. Packs can be configured to reveal automatically, or can remain ‘unopened’ until the owner chooses to open it.\n\n*For a collector*\n\n1. Browse Mystery Drop upcoming releases, or follow artists on social media\n2. When a drop opens up, buy a token which represents ownership of one of the NFTs in the collection\n3. Wait & watch the unveiling live\n4. Redeem token for an NFT, or hold the token & keep the collection intact\n\n**Under the hood**\n\nMystery Drop uses deterministic IPFS CIDs to predict where art & metadata will be pinned. These CIDs re embedded into NFT URI’s like normal, but they are un-resolvable until the artist pins the content\n\n**Our Proposal**\n\nIntegrate the Mystery Drop dynamics into the Rarible protocol & interface so Rarible users can choose a novel way to drop their NFTs to their community\n\nThis would include:\n\n- Integrating Mystery Drop scripts with Mainnet Rarible contracts\n- Integrating with mainnet NFT collection contracts\n- Developing a UX for artists to put together their drops\n   - And the subsequent unveiling\n- Improving the UX for collectors to watch the unveiling\n- Integrate option on Rarible dashboard to redirect users to Mystery Drop  when they are minting their NFTs\n\nETA: ~6 weeks (conservatively)\n\n**Funding amount**\n\n1500 RARI which will cover:\n\n- Gas & Infrastructure\n- Product, Engineering, Ecosystem building\n\nAfter launch, the MysteryDrop DAO may collect a portion of the NFT drop proceeds, or other fees to fund ongoing development.\n\n**Governance**\n\nMysteryDrop intends to launch a DAO to manage development, funding, and ecosystem support long term. The Rarible DAO will receive an allocation of founder shares in the DAO.\n\n**Accountability**\n\nActive collaboration with Rarible governance & community, as well as attending regular calls to provide updates\n\n**Why fund this?**\n\nArtists are looking for novel ways to drop NFTs and engage with their community. Having Mystery Drop as a core feature of the Rarible protocol would make Rarible more attractive when artists are selecting what platform to use, and subsequently drive marketplace activity for Rarible.",

      "content": "Forum link: https://gov.rarible.com/t/draft-proposal-mystery-drop-platform-integration-into-rarible/6339/2\n\nOverview\n\nMystery Drop enables creators such as artists and musicians, to sell a collection of NFTs before revealing the artwork. This feature enables new drop dynamics that creators can leverage to engage with their audience. The primary use case for Mystery Drop is NFT box breaks, where people can buy into a ‘pack’ of NFTs and watch the artist unveil them in real time on a live stream. Mystery Drop uses the Rarible collection smart contract to mint the NFTs. We intend to integrate the Mystery Drop dynamics into the Rarible protocol & potentially the Rarible interface so users can choose a novel way to drop their NFTs to their community.\n\nFunding amount\n\n1500 RARI which will cover:\n\n- Gas & Infrastructure\n- Product, Engineering, Ecosystem building\n- After launch, the MysteryDrop DAO may collect a portion of the NFT drop proceeds, or other fees to fund ongoing development.\n\nFunds would be sent to a Gnosis safe (0x90C7DFFA2dC273E6aFED1ad70435c15368e0d5C3) with 4 signatures, one for each of the Mystery Drop team members, and possible a member of the Rarible DAO community. In the event the team for some reason can't fulfil on its duties, remaining funds will be returned to Rarible DAO. \n\nWhy fund this?\n\nArtists are looking for novel ways to drop NFTs and engage with their community. Having Mystery Drop as a core feature of the Rarible protocol would make Rarible more attractive when artists are selecting what platform to use, and subsequently drive marketplace activity for Rarible. In addition, we intend to launch a DAO to manage development, funding, and ecosystem support long term. We intend to allocate membership in the DAO for Rarible community DAO to align all of our interests.",

      "title": "Proposal: Token Protected Content",
      "content": "FORUM link: https://gov.rarible.com/t/proposal-token-protected-content-by-mintgate/7743\n\nCategory\nNew Features through collaboration\n\nProblem\nMintGate is exploring ways to mint NFTs with royalties for users to then use with their in-house Token Protected Pages (TPP) system. This system allows users to gate any online content from external platforms so it’s only accessible to token holders giving the NFT functional value.\n\nRarible has a robust platform for minting NFTs with royalties and selling them on the market. However, these NFTs have limited or no functionality for holders, making their inherent value highly subjective. Adding utility to these NFTs gives them consistent and permanent value in any market.\n\nSolution:\n\nMintGate will integrate the Rarible Protocol for NFT minting on the platform by brands and business partners defaulting to using Rarible’s existing infrastructure for the chains that Rarible protocol supports.\n\nMintGate will build a link unlock “widget” component built to the specifications the Rarible team would need to easily drop it into Rarible’s existing platform to allow users to create token protected links, gating any online content using Rarible’s token or any NFT. This widget can also be used by any partner using the Rarible Protocol to enable creating token unlockable content!\n\nChanges and Additions to Public Interfaces:\n\nMintGate: \n- Integrate the Rarible Protocol directly to MintGate’s backend for minting of tokens through Rarible Protocol as well as update the frontend interface for the minting user-flow.\n\nRarible Protocol:\n- Add a new protocol method to define unlockable content that’ll use the MintGate’s Token Protected Pages protocol. Some small royalty will would be added to the link to fund the TPP technology.\n\n- MintGate would create a simple widget (and API) to Rarible(.com) to integrate that would allow users to specify a token protected link (and in the future, uploading of unlockable content). This widget/API would be available to any partner using the Rarible Protocol too.\n\nFunding\nWe currently have no platform token as we’re still building MintGate to provide the most value possible to our community before launching one.\n\nHowever, we would like to cultivate a long-term partnership and collaboration with Rarible DAO and protocol and keep our interests aligned as much as possible. To that end, we are able to offer a percentage of tokens delivered at time of token distribution equal to the amount of investment received in funding in this proposal. E.g.\n\n1% of total token supply distributed = $100k investment\n\n2% of total token supply distributed = $200k investment\n\n[…etc]\n\nTimeline\nIntegration of Rarible protocol minting on MintGate and development of token gating widget for Rarible to integrate when able should take 3 weeks to complete.",

Rewards of each staker exclusive of rewards of the others:  \n          V = A * (0,3 + 0,35 * (N - 1) / 365)\n->  V - total rewards of each staker inclusive of their locked token amount \n->  A - locked amount \n3.  Distribution formulas for each staker for day i :\n -  V(1).i -  first staker’s reward\n -  V(2).i -  second staker’s reward.  \n    ……………….\n -  V(N).i - N staker’s reward.\n4. Calculation of each staker’s reward amount in the context of all other stakers’ contributions for day i:\n           V(I am).i / V(all stakers).i = P.i\n           V(all stakers).i = V(1).i + V(2).i + V(3).i + ... + V(N).i\nwhere  ->   P.i - is the amount of an individual reward against the contributions of all stakers. \n5.  Dividing the weekly rewards of all stakers by 7 to get the daily  reward amount: \n           25000 / 7 days = 3571,43\n6.  S - my reward for day i among other stakers’ rewards:\n           S.i = P.i  * 3571,43\n7.  At the end of the week we get: \n           S(1...7) = S(1) + S(2) + ... + S(i) + ... + S(7)\n\nExample:\n1)   I own 100 RARI and I wish to stake them.\n2)  There is a total of 3 such stakers (including myself). Let Alice stake   300 Rari and Bob - 600 Rari.\n        -   “I am” started staking at the beginning of the week. \n        -  Alice started staking on day 3 (incl).   \n        -  Bob started staking on day 5 (incl). \n4)  All of us will hold tokens until the end of the week: \n        - “I am” held his token for 7 days  \n        - Alice held hers for 5 days  \n        - Bob held his tokens for 3 days \n5)   Let’s calculate the final reward amount for day 1 for “I am”:\n          V(I am).1 = 100 * (0,3 * 2 + 0,35 * (1 - 1)/365) = 30,00\n6)   The final reward amount for “I am” for day 2:\n          V(I am).2 =  V(I am).1 + 100 * 0,35 * (2 - 1)/365) = 30,10\n7)  And so on in the same fashion the reward amount increases every day as per the formula below:  \n           V(I am) =   A * (0,3  + 0,35 * (N - 1)/365)\n8)  We then calculate the reward amount (P) of all stakers per certain day. Let’s take day 5:\n          - by this day I am has held his tokens for 5 full days.\n          - Alice - for 3 full days.\n          - Bob - for 1 full day.\n\nP(I am).5 = V(I am).5 / ( V(I am).5 + V(Alice).5 + V(Bob).5) = \n= 100 * (0,3 + 0,35 * (5 -1)/365) / (100 * (0,3 + 0,35 * (5 -1)/365)  + 300 * (0,3 + 0,35 * (3 -1)/365 + 600 *(0,3 + 0,35 * (1 - 1) / 365) = 0,100956\n\n9)   Hence, the reward for day 5 from the daily norm of 3571,43 RARI would equal:\n         S(I am).5 = P(I am).5 * 3571,43 = 360, 56 RARI  \n10) This happens every day and once 25000 tokens are given to all stakers, you get:\n         S(I am)(1..7) = 3571,43 + 3571,43 + 897,13 + 897,12+ 360, 56 + 360, 55 + 360,54 = 10018,76 RARI\n\nFull version (with graphics and spreadsheet): \nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1W6PpRnALfMZi3m2dAhvfCt7uEJTODs3vo5YWGDJ7p-Y/edit?usp=sharing\n",

I am not sure if anyone is aware, but the Binace Smart Chain is currently\nactive and is having a massive transfer of users. I  just wrote a whole big thing out, so I will keep it this short. I know many projects have had their tokens moved over, many more are, and many more are discussing it. The fact is, no one knows when for sure Etherium transaction prices will get better, meanwhile, the price only seems to increase, while. So, this vote is not on transferring over. It is a vote on whether we should discuss the possibility of it. Thank you so much for your time and ear. \nHappy Inovating. ",

      "content": "Many consider the current model of distributing 75k tokens flat on a weekly basis suboptiomal.\nThere are platform participants and bigger names that push the high majority of the total transactions, and as RARI is a governance token, \"centralize\" a lot of power in their hands. \nThere are participants who may not push as high a volume of transactions, or may not be art creators/collectors at all but believe in the platform, in its current form as well as in what it can become. Others may be helping grow the platform in vastly different ways via own professional skills, connections and networks and see the possibilities of other NFT asset classes being implemented.\nIf we seek decentralization, let those that believe and support the growth of the platform do so without diluting their governing power.\n\nTherefore I would like to propose a system that rewards a flat VALUE  but also allows other supporters to retain value and governance power.\n\nReward a flat X amount of value (let's say dollars)  per week, represented in Y RARI tokens. \nSo the RARI token distribution would be  Y  where  Y = X/currentRARIprice\n\ni.e.\nif a total distribution of $150K is decided then \n----if currentRARIprice = $2\n--------$150.000/2 = 75k RARI \n----if currentRARIprice = $1.5\n--------$150.000/1.5 = 100k RARI \n----if currentRARIprice = $2.5\n--------$150.000/2.5 = 60k RARI  \netc.\n\nObviously the formula is to be discussed and the flat value of the rewards could be re-adjusted based on the number of total participants getting rewarded for example.\n\nThis way the participants would be getting their value no matter the price fluctuation, and those that want to support and hold governing power in the platform would not be deminished, as the value increase would carry a reduction in governance power dilution from those who only reap the value short term  and incentivize accumulation and holding for those that want to support and participate longer term.\n",

      "content": "With this proposal, we are kicking off a huge governance experiment on Rarible: community grants! As we aim at becoming a fully community-governed NFT marketplace, user participation is vital to align incentives and establish sustainable development. And it has to be rewarded! \n\nThis proposal is set to allocate the first two community grants as a pilot, worth a total of $5000. \n\n### What are community grants?\n\nCommunity grants are funds to be allocated to community members that spend their time and efforts doing a particular set of tasks, beneficial to Rarible as a platform, it's creators and collectors. There are tasks in different categories: research, additional development, marketing, and more. In the nearest future, we plan to establish community grants for all these categories. \n\n### What are we voting for?\n\nThis voting is set to decide what these funds will be allocated for in the first batch. \n\nWe have thoroughly reviewed all the proposals made at [gov.rarible.com](http://gov.rarible.com): there are many exciting & reasonable ideas. Still, more in-depth research has to be done on most of those to form a proposal for the voting. \n\nWe suggest 5 options for the first community grant: \n\n1) **Logarithmic $RARI distribution – research & modeling** \n\nRationale: several proposals have been made on [gov.rarible.com](http://gov.rarible.com) regarding alternative $RARI distribution models. To make sure they are sustainable, and figure out the best options for the community and marketplace, we need a designated person or a team to make an in-depth research of the suggested models, do the calculations and simulations. \nIt also includes research on $RARI [reward factors](https://gov.rarible.com/t/proposal-rari-reward-factors/241/5). \n\n2) **Anti-wash trading – tool development**\n\nRationale: with increasing volumes, wash trading gets harder to track manually. We plan to allocate a community grant for developing a tool that will help us identify wash traders automatically. \n\n3) **Reduced fees in $RARI – research & modeling**\n\nRationale: to make the marketplace experience as friendly and affordable as it can be, we are looking into introducing an alternative option to pay commissions in $RARI instead of ETH, at a lower rate. To implement this, we first need to do research and create mathematical model to find the optimal solution for the marketplace and the community. \n\n4) **Historical airdrop – collecting data**\n\nRationale: with $RARI token launch, we have conducted an airdrop to all NFT holders out there, regardless of the platform used for purchase. However, not everyone received the airdrop due to information limits and lack of knowledge. We are looking to allocate funds to a person/a team that will help us to identify and collect data about NFT holders that haven't yet received the aidrop.\n\n5) **Other**\n\nRationale: if you don't see a preferred option and want the grant allocated for something else, choose this and proceed to discussion on https://gov.rarible.com/. \n\n### Allocation\nThe 1st place according to the voting will be granted $3000 \nThe 2nd place according to the voting will be granted $2000 \n\nWhat the first community grant should be allocated for?",

      "content": "This vote will establish the amount of commissions buyers will pay to the platform. We will also set the primary and secondary sale commissions for the platform, assessed from the sellers.\n\n### Summary\n\nLast week, we kicked off the discussion about funding the platform development and community grants on [https://gov.rarible.com](https://gov.rarible.com/). The initial discussion by the community [can be seen here](https://gov.rarible.com/t/the-first-rari-reform-rr1-community-grants-and-dev-funding/122). We considered all suggestions community made: the most popular ones were 10% for the primary market and 5% for the secondary market. Please note these fees are split between both buyers and sellers. (total for buyers and sellers). \nNow, the exact commission needs to be decided on for each type of marketplace participants. From the suggestions made, we calculated that would approximately make 2.5% buyer fee, 7.5% initial seller fee, 2.5% secondary sale seller fee. \n\n**There are 3 separate voting proposals created to vote on:** \n\n- Commission paid by buyers\nTher buyer pays the **price** of an item **plus the buyers fee** on top. The buyer's fee is the same for all purchases. \n\n**Example**: if the item costs 100 ETH, and the buyer fee is set at 2%, the buyer will pay 102 ETH.\n- Commission payed by sellers for primary sales\nWhen minting an item on Rarible and making the first sale of this item on Rarible, the seller will receive the **price** of the item **minus the first sale seller fee.**\n\n**Example**: if the item that costs 100 ETH, if the buyer fee is set at 2%, and the first sale seller fee is set at 2%, the creator will receive 98 ETH.\n- Commission paid by sellers for secondary sales\nIn case of other sale of an item except the first sale of an item minted on Rarible (e.g. sale of an item created not on Rarible; secondary sale of an item created on Rarible), the seller will receive the **price** of the item **minus the secondary sale seller fe**e.\n\n**Example**: if the item that costs 100 ETH, if the buyer fee is set at 2%, and the secondary sale seller fee is set at 2%, the creator will receive 98 ETH.\n\n### Description\n\nThe fees are introduced as a step towards the final goal of creating Rarible DAO and decentralizing the platform.\n\n**The core goals are:**\n\n- **Reduced [wash trading](https://hedgetrade.com/what-is-wash-trading-on-crypto-exchanges/) \nIntrodicing fees will eliminate incentives for wash traders. If someone makes a fake trade for 100 ETH, once the fees are established, he will have to pay (e.g.) 2.5% buyers fee and 2.5% sellers fee which totals over 1,8k USD. As our community helps us identify wash traders, he won't receive any $RARI –– but will pay a fee for his trick.**\n- Community grants \nA part of the collected fees will be allocated for grants to support artists, active community members and grants for improvements (3rd party offers on making something useful for the community).\n- Ambassador program \nA part of the collected fees will be allocated to the users bringing $RARI to the world: brand promotion and other ambassador activities.\n- Dev funding \nProject development takes a lot of time & resources. Fees will let us facilitate sustainable development and make the platform better.\n\n### Funds distribution & storage\n\nThe commissions collected will be securely stored in a cold wallet in full custody of the team. \n\n**At this stage, the commisions will go to:** \n\n- Financing project development\n- Community grants that are subject to the governance process (the community will decide who receives the grants)\n- Ambassador program\n\nAllocation of funds among community grants, ambassador program and development funding will be determined by the team. \n\n### Voting period\n\nThe voting is takes place from 12 Sept 2020 to 19 Sept 2020, and might be extended if consensus is not reached.\n\n### Options:\n\n**Option 1:** Commission paid by buyers 0%, commission payed by sellers for primary sales 10%, commission paid by sellers for secondary sales 2%\n\n**Option 2:** Commission paid by buyers 2%, commission payed by sellers for primary sales 7%, commission paid by sellers for secondary sales 2%\n\n**Option 3:** Commission paid by buyers 2.5%, commission payed by sellers for primary sales 5%, commission paid by sellers for secondary sales 2.5%",

      "content": "My proposal is a revamp of the Community Grants / Dev Funding RR1. The facts stay the same and I feel like funding should still be split between it so if you haven't already read the current one - make sure you do!\n\nSo the reason why I decided to create this revamp is due to the community speaking out for the fees. In the government channel, we agreed on a fee about 5% rather then 10% but people may still feel 5% for artists is a high fee. In regard to this, I'm making 3 choices that people can decide to and see if this holds more worth then the current choices. - Make sure to think about all parties then be bias when voting as RARI holders votes are VERY important.\n\n*Option 1* - Commission paid by buyers 2.5%, commission payed by sellers for primary sales 2.5%, commission paid by sellers for secondary sales 2.5%\n\n*Option 2* - Commission paid by buyers 3%, commission payed by sellers for primary sales 1.5%, commission paid by sellers for secondary sales 3%\n\n*Option 3* - Commission paid by buyers 2%, commission payed by sellers for primary sales 2%, commission paid by sellers for secondary sales 3.5%\n\nThese are not drastically big but I tried keep as unbiased as an artist can.",
