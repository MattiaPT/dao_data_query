      "content": "Author: ROPLΛK #6001\n\nAs we all know, SOSIP #22 of July 2022 stopped payments to contributors, which has shown throughout all these months that it is almost impossible to maintain such a large community and such an ambitious project without people dedicated almost exclusively to it. . During these 7 months, the vast majority of the people in charge of the maintenance and development of the platform have decided to move away towards other personal projects, which is reasonable from every point of view.\n\nI believe that today we need a compact team, made up of few people but dedicated full-time with salaries in line with the current reality of the market, which is why I propose:\n\n- Create a work team of between 6 and 10 people who work together for the development of the DAO and its services \n- Set only 2 levels: Staff and Mods \n- Set reasonable salaries for the current market at $4K for staff and $1.5K for mods, paid 75% in USD (using SOS and its current price) and 25% as a fixed amount in SOS \n- Request the treasury the necessary funds for this purpose to cover expenses for 6 months. \n- Request extra funds from the treasury for eventualities or outsourced expenses that may arise during this period \n- Create a new multisig wallet for the operational wallet managed by the staff with at least 3 signatures needed to move the funds and pay expenses and salaries.\n\nForum link below:\nhttps://forum.theopendao.com/thread/relaunch-of-a-team-of-collaborators-42179/1954171",

The greatest strength remains its community, arguably one of crypto’s most remarkable examples of decentralised community-driven governance. \n\nAs the best Christmas gift ever for the entire NFT community, $SOS airdrop is the most fair launch ever in the history of crypto currency, with no team reserve tokens nor any public/private sales. The revolution has not only injected billions of dollars worth of liquidity into the market but also approved to the world collectively the power of community when united.\n\n#SaveOurSoul\n\nDiscussion Link: https://forum.theopendao.com/thread/41733",

      "title": "SOSIP-19-Replenish Operational Wallet",
      "content": "The initial budget was created and approved in [SOSIP-5](https://snapshot.org/#/theopendao.eth/proposal/0xc6c082d93b4b945f168b711f1b55f1366f1bfc9473eb1f549574f1f880107ed8) on 19 January 2022. $2M worth of SOS was transferred to the [operational wallet](https://gnosis-safe.io/app/eth:0x578ff4c0ee51bdC90E8ACc9990CD09A897ef36Ab/balances). Since then, the team has continued to deliver value for our community members, but with the combination of crypto market experiencing a bearish cycle for a while and a decline in $SOS, the value of the initial deposit to the operational wallet has decreased to a point where it must be replenished.\n\nThe original replenishment was planned to happen 6 months after the initial deposit to the  operational budget, however, an immediate reevaluation is required due to a low balance in the budget. In Web2 terms, it takes 3-4 years for startups to generate profit, until then, it requires a constant inflow of supporting funds.\n\nThe priority of the OpenDAO has always been expanding the ecosystem and building the infrastructures to support the web3/NFT space. To realize this goal, it is necessary to continue investing in the DAO.\n\n\n### Milestones\nUp until now, a total of 42.41ETH (~$150,000) worth of revenue has been generated by [Genesis Membership NFT collection](https://opensea.io/collection/opendao-genesis-membership) and SOSMarket. As voted on in [SOSIP-6](https://snapshot.org/#/theopendao.eth/proposal/0xa8ed2468732f6c17f5e7c911d18084c36f8d45b68dcaad9852917ef7579d4ad6), the 42.41ETH has been sent to the $veSOS staking pool to reward the stakers.\n\nThe team has launched the Genesis Membership NFT collection, SOSMarket and 721Starter. In development are, 20K Profile Picture NFT collection, Big Time P2E gaming guilds, 721Max, OpenDAO Academy, and 721Artist. The progress of development and deliveries are going smoothly according to the roadmap on the homepage. New projects are constantly being planned, there will be no end to the OpenDAO roadmap.\n\nPlease read the [February](https://theopendao.medium.com/the-opendao-milestone-report-february-2022-6c9604984c3f) and [March](https://theopendao.medium.com/the-opendao-milestone-report-march-2022-a26b7cacf286) milestone articles for more details.\n\n\n### Current balance of operational wallet\nThough the chart below shows ample balances for each budget with which the OpenDAO can continue to operate for the planned duration of 6 months, the current balance that is presented does not reflect the current valuation of $SOS. In reality, the current value of the operational wallet is only going to last until May 1st, 2022. \n\nTo put that in perspective, after token price adjustment, the initial $2M deposit is equivalent to $1.18M at the time of writing.\n\n[The OpenDAO Operational Budget Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/188AKTdLbGsYJSTpCqpw0IW4VhqHidmKVfn6oJbVFmR4/edit#gid=1952598667)\n\n![image](ipfs://QmfMf9m2xTkJrLrgSiMf3v4AtSDLCPorJoiWEsbYfcHgS1)\n\nIn accordance with SOSIP-5, five budgets have been set up. However, as the DAO begins to mature and grow, it has become clear that the original budgets are no longer suitable.\nFor example, the previous breakdown of the budget capped the development expense budget at $0.2M and there are new budgets that are required.\n\n### Total budget: \n$2.5M worth of $SOS and 600B $SOS for 6 months or until depletion. The long-term incentives budget is for contributor incentive that was passed in [SOSIP-13](https://snapshot.org/#/theopendao.eth/proposal/0xacbc420c3696740786c76065c51cb8bc5ed0982d2162ee3f74441c14785b91c6)\n\n#### New budget breakdown\nTalent Compensation $1.2M,\nCommunity Events $0.41M,\nMarketing $0.2M,\nProject Contingency $0.1M,\nMiscellaneous Expense $0.12M,\nDevelopment Team $0.44M,\nLong-term Incentives 600B $SOS.",

      "content": "### Team: \nAuthor(s):  angyts.eth#1111, Paul Ang, a core contributor of the OpenDAO, a family physician, and a adjunct lecturer at a local university.\n\n**Date first posted: 15th March, 2022**\n\n### Summary: \n> The OpenDAO academy will execute the mission of the OpenDAO to promote education in the cryptosphere. \n\nThe OpenDAO academy will host a flagship cohort graduate practice Diploma in Web3 program. There will be a free audit and a pay-to-earn-a-qualification-NFTs-on-chain segment. \n\n### Background:\nThe OpenDAO academy will start with a program according to [this syllabus](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CXfDNHGYT0nzN-mdu485PHagoC0QK7BoKZRa8k76GxI/edit#heading=h.nnrnqu6pzrvw).\n\n> It is remarkable how educators can change the destiny of an entire industry, let alone a DAO. \n\nIf we were to execute this beautifully, the OpenDAO academy would attract the best brains and leaders to the OpenDAO while grooming new talent. \n\n### Budget and Financials:\nWe will request for a one time grant from the OpenDAO of $100,000 USD in $SOS tokens. This will be used to pay for the lead educator Angyts’s teaching hours, guest speakers, and a lean teaching assistant team, who will double up as IT, media and administrative support. Angyts will reduce his remuneration as a core contributor of the OpenDAO according to the reduction in his portfolio of operations work in the OpenDAO.\n\nIf we were to collect course signup fees, donations, sponsorships and any source of revenue, it would be put into an endowment fund after deducting funds used in operations. The endowment fund would not be spent until it reaches a 10 million USD amount.\n\nFor strong alignment of the OpenDAO academy and the OpenDAO, most of the endowment fund received will be converted to $SOS.\n\n**All funds will be in custody by the OpenDAO operational team. All expenditure will be submitted on a monthly reimbursement basis with the OpenDAO operational team, subject to the team's approval before disbursement.**\n\n### Objectives:\nLong term profitability is the first goal, together with a great course that has a great social component as well as learning opportunities. So this will assume a large enrolment, which is the natural effect of a great course.\n\n> Personal anecdotes from students will tell us how the OpenDAO academy has opened doors to Web3.\n\nOur graduates will continue to serve key positions in the web3 ecosystem. We will attract students from all other Web3 protocols.\n\nThe ultimate goal would be for the OpenDAO academy to **“live off the land\"**. As long as the OpenDAO $SOS continues to create value, and continues to maintain the valuation of $SOS, the OpenDAO academy can continue to run for **eternity**.\n\n### Timeline:\nOn approval of the grant by snapshot, the OpenDAO academy will start recruitment and start the first block of lessons on the first week of April 2022. \n\n[More details in the forum.](https://forum.theopendao.com/thread/the-opendao-academy-36550)",

      "content": "### Author(s): Angyts\n\n### Date: 2022/02/25\n\n### Summary: \n[721Starter](721.com), the premium NFT launchpad at [721.com](721.com) only allows for the top 1% of our users to participate in, or the top ~2000 wallets. We have heard feedback to reduce the barrier of participation. \n\n### Background:\n[Some data to explore](https://create.piktochart.com/output/57895562-sos-power)\n\n![Percentiles](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/864823485183295519/946816984912367616/Screenshot_2022-02-25_at_11.07.18_PM.png)\n\n\nMost launchpads in this space are highly competitive and exclusive. Most require participants to put up 1 ETH to 10 ETH to be eligible for an allocation. We initially pegged our entry to 1 B SOS Power which is about $1870 USD right now, as winning any of the raffle would make this participation very worthwhile.\n\nAs you can see, our tokens are highly concentrated amongst a small group of diamond hands. \n\n### Implications\n#### Pros: \n- By lowering the entry number of tokens, a wider portion of our community can potentially participate. \n- A launchpad with a wider participation can potentially request for more whitelist spots.\n\n#### Cons:\n- Smaller accounts that win the whitelist might not have sufficient ETH to mint the NFT even if they won, and they might proceed to take profit immediately after mint.\n- The large account holders still maintain a **large disproportionate** chance of winning the whitelist. \n\n### Key Measurables:\nIf the barrier of participation is lowered, we want to see more users participating and joining the 721Starter.\n\n### Timeline:\nIf snapshot is passed, it can be immediately enacted on the next NFT launch.\nThere is also a [forum post](https://forum.theopendao.com/thread/improvements-to-the-721starter-system-36186) about tiering the SOS Power, but we are still working on it.\n\n### Snapshot vote\nThe minimum SOS Power to join 721Starter at 721.com should be _______.\n",

      "title": "SOSIP-13-Contributors Bonus & Long Term Incentive Plan",
      "content": "Prepared by: 9x9x9\nReviewed by: Dyno; Taegeuk\n\n### Background\n\nUnlike most projects, the contributor team reserved nothing for themselves in OpenDAO. All of the contributors joined with passion and worked for free in the beginning.\n\n[SOSIP-5 passed](https://snapshot.org/#/theopendao.eth/proposal/0xc6c082d93b4b945f168b711f1b55f1366f1bfc9473eb1f549574f1f880107ed8), allowing for contributors to be compensated for their efforts, there are different levels of remuneration depending on one’s role in the DAO and each level provides a fixed amount of remuneration.\n\nAs contributor skillset and experience grows, if he/she remains in the same position with a fixed income salary, he/she is more likely to leave the DAO and start new projects for more achievements. \n\nThus, to retain our valuable talents and align the contributors’ mindset, we would like to propose further long term incentives for contributors. We believe that not only will new incentives reward continuous value creation, but also inspire top talents across the space to join the contributor team.\n\n### Short term bonus\n\n\n#### Coordinape\nAllow DAO team members to collectively reward each other making community payments more equitable and transparent.\n\n#### Tip.cc\nContributors are also entitled to receive casual $SOS tips from Telegram & Discord community members if the community recognizes their service.\n\n#### Performance bonus\nThe discretionary bonus is designed to reward the contributors who made significant contributions towards $SOS token value or dramatically exceed their standard duty as per role based on contributors’ monthly peer review.\n\n\n### Long term incentives\n#### Contributor Incubator Funds:\nIf a contributor decides to start a project of any kind, there will be a direct access to a portion of funds from OpenDAO treasury, which will be invested to the contributor to help with the idea and dream that he wants to pursue. If the project does well, the DAO treasury can also capture some of the value and increase DAO treasury.\n\n#### Contributor Option:\nThis is for contributors who wish to own more $SOS tokens. The more tokens a contributor owns, the more incentives there are to achieve significant progress with the highest efficiency and passion. \n\nContributors will receive option credits equal to an agreed-upon ratio of the monthly salary. Option credits can be accumulated up to 6 months and will allow the contributors to buy $SOS from the treasury valued at the lowest price in the past 6 months recorded on CoinMarketCap. If a contributor has joined the team for less than 6 months, his earliest right to exercise the option will be the date that he joined the team. Option credits will have to be used before the contributor leaves OpenDAO.\n\n#### Sabbatical Leave:\nContributors who have been with OpenDAO for more than 2 months will be entitled to 4 days of paid leave to combat burnout, and stress. The sabbatical leaves can be accumulated and replenishes every 2 months. Application for leave must be submitted for approval a week in advance, with tasks properly delegated to another colleague.\n\n### How the options will work\nOptions will be represented by NFTs, unlimited in supply, and have face values of 10K, 50K, and 100K. The option NFT is non-transferable, bonded to a contributor’s address, and serve only as an option proof. Tokens bought will have linear vesting of 6 months done through a smart contract, this means the tokens will be locked up and slowly released to the contributor. If a contributor leaves within the vesting period, the effect on the option will depend on the nature of the departure.\n\nFor example, A has joined the team for 3 months and is entitled to execute an option at lowest price point within the 3 months working period. If A exercises his option, he will purchase $SOS from the treasury at $0.000001, the lowest price within the last 3 months, and slowly release 1/6 of the position per month for the next 6 months at market rate.\n\n#### An example\n\nAssumptions:\n3 months lowest price: $0.000001\nCurrent price: $0.000005\nProfit ratio: 5x\nA has accumulated 50k option credits\n$SOS price remain unchanged within the next 6 months for calculation purpose\n\nA pays treasury a sum of $50,000, treasury gives A $250,000 worth of $SOS token at $0.000001 per $SOS with 6 month vesting period, releasing ⅙ per month for the next 6 months.\nEach month, A can sell ⅙ of the $250,000 worth of $SOS position which is roughly $41,750 at market price.\n\nSo A effectively pays the treasury $8,250 to mint this non-transferable NFT that’s worth $208,250 to be paid off in full within 6 months.\n",

      "title": "SOSIP-15-Build an OpenDAO gallery and vault to showcase the work of emerging artists",
      "content": "### Team: Authors:  Mt.gox_survivor#1081, Angyts\n\n### Date: 2022/02/26\n\n[Original forum post](https://forum.theopendao.com/thread/executable-build-an-opendao-gallery-and-vault-to-showcase-the-work-of-emerging-artists-35831)\n[Our official partner NFTwiki.org providing the platform support](https://forum.theopendao.com/thread/nftwiki-collaboration-a-nft-opinion-consensus-platform-35860)\n\n### Summary:\nThe OpenDAO will purchase works of emerging artists. \nThe decision to purchase can be made by quadratic voting with $SOS on our [NFT social consensus platform](https://nftwiki.theopendao.com/consensusBoard). \nIf the price rises in the future, we can sell works to boost our treasury. \nNew artists will become $SOS holders. $SOS stakers and LP providers can be incentivised and rewarded by allowing them to purchase artwork at a discounted price from the treasury.\n \n### Background:\nBy directly supporting the work of emerging artists. Emerging artists become part of our ecosystem by holding $SOS and staking $SOS. By the actions of our community, we can shape the future of what kind of art and culture we would like to cultivate.\n\n### Budget and Financials:\n- 50 to 150 ETH worth of $SOS tokens to be transferred to a community art treasury, under the custody of the core contributors team of the OpenDAO.\n- Sponsorships are possible.\n- In the future, artefacts of interest can be valued with the same process and put up for bidding. $SOS stakers get a discount off the winning price.\n- Excess revenue can be voted to reward our $SOS stakers or other purposes as the DAO deems fit.\n\n### Details of implementation\n- A micro site to allow emerging artists to submit work, and for users to nominate art work is being built right now. \n- There will also be an OpenDAO gallery on the same site.\n- A nomination period will run for a week, then there will be a week for voting to happen.\n- In these 2 weeks, community campaigning by the artist can be encouraged. A community event and AMA will be beneficial for the artist. \n- If voting is passed on the site, purchase of the digital art will be made. \n- In the future, it is possible to sell the work through a similar valuation and a community bidding process.\n- $SOS stakers get a discount off the final price. \n- The exact mechanism will be up for further discussion in our forums. For example, do we cap each art work at 0.1 ETH (140 M $SOS) or lower? And how many pieces do we buy each week?\n\n### Key Objectives:\n- Degree of attention to emerging artists\nArtists will be labeled as emerging or mid-career, or established artists according to internal metrics and will not be openly published. But a general percentage will be published. And we will focus on emerging and early mid-career artists. Identifiable data will be handled as per data protection laws.\n- Diversity and inclusiveness metrics\nBasic biodata will be asked from artists for internal use only. They have a right to refuse. Metrics like age, sex, nationality, language and disabilities will be collected. Again, only a general percentage published. Identifiable data will be handled as per data protection laws.\n- Utility of $SOS token\n- Increased numbers of active voters over time.\n- Community Tension\nHaving events that occur regularly helps to energize the community. Increased community voice and chat activities over time. Increased server retention metrics.\n\n### Snapshot Vote\nI agree that  _____ worth of $SOS tokens to be transferred to the OpenDAO Gallery Wallet\n\n",

      "content": "Prepared by: angyts, taegeuk\n\nOver the past few hours, there have been some unfortunate cases of users falling victim to exploits, causing them to lose numerous valuable NFTs [to this address](https://etherscan.io/address/0x3E0DeFb880cd8e163baD68ABe66437f99A7A8A74).\n\nWe would like to request for $170,000 USD worth of $SOS to compensate the victims of the recent exploit. Compensating victims on OpenSea has been one of the OpenDAO’s core mission, and we would like to take this opportunity to take a step in this direction.\n\nPlease keep in mind that this is an evolving situation, we believe that it is a complex social engineering attack and not a smart contract failure.\n\nWe will also open up the [compensation wallet address](https://etherscan.io/address/0x5f17672F4a970bA8a080238676b8103E7Ceaea26) for public donation of ETH and $SOS. [This wallet](https://etherscan.io/address/0x5f17672F4a970bA8a080238676b8103E7Ceaea26) is custodied by the core contributors of the OpenDAO.\n\nWe will open up a channel for compensation and for victims to submit a compensation request, associated with a signed message to prove ownership of the wallet.\n\nThe compensation window will run for one month after the last attack in this incident. The valuation of the NFT will be based on the 7 days average floor price at time of exploit. After being verified, the victim will be compensated \n\nThe total sum of funds in the compensation wallet will be fully disbursed to all the verified victims of this attack according to their claim as a proportion of the total claims submitted.\n\n> For example, person A claim $10, person B $20 and person C $30. After verifying the claims to be accurate, A will get 16%, B 33% and C 50% of total sum of the compensation wallet at the end of the claim window.\n\n## To qualify for compensation:\nThis compensation is specifically for victims of the recent exploit.\nProof of ownership of the affected wallet by signing a signature.\nHelp us by providing accurate information regarding the claim.\n\n## How you can help:\n1. Donate $SOS or ETH to [0x5f17672F4a970bA8a080238676b8103E7Ceaea26](https://gnosis-safe.io/app/eth:0x5f17672F4a970bA8a080238676b8103E7Ceaea26/balances)\n2. Assist in analysing real victims of the exploit\n3. If you have worked in insurance or legal claims before, please apply for work at the OpenDAO. This will be funded by our operational wallet [in this snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/theopendao.eth/proposal/0xc6c082d93b4b945f168b711f1b55f1366f1bfc9473eb1f549574f1f880107ed8). \nSpread the word\nTeach others to avoid falling for similar scams, education is key\nVoting yes for this snapshot\nHelp us create a long term sustainable compensation plan for victims of other exploits\n",

The received $SOS will be exchanged for ETH to be used to create new markets in SOSMarket.\n\n# Proposed usage of funds\n\n1) Funds for market creations\n\nSome funds will be used to create more markets. \n\nThe purpose of this is to provide more accurate and extensive information for forecasting and to create time-sensitive markets that users will find useful.\n\nOf the requested budget, an average of 5 ETH will be allocated per market creation and the rest will be reserved for additional liquidity for popular markets.\n\n2) Liquidity providing\n\nSome funds will be used to add liquidity to popular markets. \n\nLiquidity is crucial for users to be able to enter and exit markets. The more liquidity there is in a market, the less impact each transaction has on the price of shares. The price stability will allow users to participate actively in the prediction market. A more liquid market also tends to be more attractive for large market players.\n\n3) Market ends\n\nWhen the market resolves the ETH can be returned, plus the fees earned from providing liquidity, minus the gas fees paid. With proper management and decisions, this ETH might be able to seed this SOSMarket for a long time.\n\n# Benefits to the OpenDAO\n\nCreation of time-sensitive or controversial content on SOSMarket will increase participation and bring streams of new users. Increased participation will directly result in better forecasts of each market.\n\nEvery trade on SOSMarket will take a 2.5% fee that is allocated to the $veSOS staking pool.\n\n# Profits from SOSMarket\n\nAs of Jan. 28th, 2022, all of the incoming ETH in [our operational treasury](https://gnosis-safe.io/app/eth:0x578ff4c0ee51bdC90E8ACc9990CD09A897ef36Ab/transactions/history) right now is generated from the SOSMarket. \n\nThe SOSMarket which is a new product has currently collected 1.02859678 ETH worth of revenue to purchase $SOS tokens from the market to reward our $veSOS stakers. \n\nWith this proposal, we expect to see exponential growth in the revenue generated.\n\n[Link to document.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DlcSiP8nOl3Uq6N5MI2KJmP5GiaLiq4ls3GCSnFEZkE/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n\n",

(Could be wallets are lost or claim size too small, not able to cover their gas fee at current SOS price level)\n2: People might remember the 30th of June and not be able to check the proposals and governance votes in time.\n\nPlease vote in the best interest of OpenDAO!\nThanks for your vote!",
