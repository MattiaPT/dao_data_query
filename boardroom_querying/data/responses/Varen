      "title": "Gas Hopper Airdrop campaign",
      "content": "Exec Summary:\n\nHerein we propose a marketing campaign whereby users are rewarded for interacting and using Gas Hopper via an airdrop in the Varen token. A request of 888 Varen for the entire campaign would need to be ratified. \n\nIntro & Motivation: \n\nIn light of the Ren situation and Varens Primary product, VarenX in temporary limp mode, we found a pressing need to keep the community engaged and to keep the wheels in motion with the aspects of Varen which are not affected by the above. Essentially, we are in effect staying true to the path that we had set out upon when we had initially embarked on this journey, which was to build Varen Suite, an array of products that had market use and not simply reliant on any one product. \n\nGas Hopper, a smaller Dapp in the suite, provides us with just that. A niche product offering cross chain gas swaps which generates the DAO 10usd for every transaction. \n\nLead dev, Linkie Link, recently announced an 18 Varen buy back from the up to date transaction income generated. Whilst it may seem miniscule, the potential for an income generator for the DAO and a chance to turn this into a cash cow is now apparent. \n\nTo that end, to drive users to the product, to generate a buzz around the varen ecosystem and for it step out into the light, marketing and exposure is essential.\n\nMarketing? to who? i hear you say. Let me give you a very basic backdrop to that. The market is currently processing Billions of US Dollars daily in volume across multiple segments such as cross chaining, gaming, trading, NFTs etc. These users, in the 10s of thousands, would then generally use traditional routes in and out of CEXs to fund their wallets with relevant Gas for those transactions. Cexs = KYC, compounded with fees which can then spiral above the ticket price at Gas Hopper. Beyond that Gas Hopper is a no frills, one click, user friendly way to do so.\n\nSo the next logical question would then be, ok, so how do we target the users and gain that all important exposure? There are multiple possible avenues which we can explore, but lets focus our attention on the one that is being proposed. The GH Airdrop campaign. A simple, tried and tested method where put simply, the wheel spins, so why try to reinvent it? \n\n\nTarget and Aim:\n\n\nThe Airdrop campaign would aim to target new users, by paying them to do so. Users will use Gas Hopper atleast once to get paid out their rewards. A win-win! \n\nWhat we look to primarily achieve through this campaign is as highlighted before, exposure, whilst tapping into a new pool of users. But more specifically, we would look to achieve the following: \n\n1) A minimum of 810 market participants.\n2) Social Media impressions of 100k +. \n3) Expand Varen holder base by circa 100% of its current size. \n4) Reinvigorate the community and maintain engagement. \n5) Attempt to generate residual income for the DAO, creating runway for its future.\n6) Create a launchpad for future campaigns \n\nExecution Summary OPTION 1:\n\n1) Request 888 Varen from Treasury. \n2) Execute based on a script organised by @LinkieLink to select eligibility of users \n3) airdrop to be handled/sent manually from core team. \n4) First 810 transactions through the door starting from a minimum of 10 days on approval of this proposal with official date tbd. \n5) Airdrop to be sent out within a 28 day period from the date of closure to entrants.\n\nExecution Summary OPTION 2:\n\n1) Request unlimited Varen from Treasury. \n2) Execute based on a script organised by @LinkieLink to select eligibility of users \n3) airdrop to be handled/sent manually from core team. \n4) Transactions eligible over a period of three months period through the door starting from a minimum of 10 days on approval of this proposal with official date tbd. \n5) Airdrop to be sent out within a 28 day period from the date of closure to entrants.\n\nT&Cs:\n\nWe all love to get to the meat of the move, but one must always read the small print. \n\n1) Use Gas Hopper service atleast once (from date tbd).\n2) Buy and hold a min of 2 Varen from campaign launch and for entire period up until receiving of reward (date tbd).\n3) Like and Retweet the official Varen social related to the airdrop. \n4) Join Varen discord\n\nRewards: \n\nYes please! \n\n1) 1 Varen per wallet distributed to 800 market participants (for execution Option 1, Execution Option 2 would be 1 Varen per eligible user).  \n\n2) 10 additional Random lucky participants will get a multiplier on their rewards as per (only applies for execution option 1): \n\nA) An 8.8 Varen Reward each.\n\n3) Potential Varen NFT merch (being worked on)\n\n\nADDITIONAL IMPORTANT MEMO: \n\nDue to a member of core suggesting that it may be a good idea to do this campaign as an open ended campaign whereby we would run a three month campaign and any usage within that period would be eligible for the Varen Airdrop under same terms, we have drafted up two exection summaries with the community having final say which emission level they would like to go with. With the three month campaign option, the max emission would be the total remainder of the treasury which is approx 40k Varen, so this would need to be taken into consideration should you choose to vote that option. \n\nVOTE OPTIONS: \n\nFor: Execution Option 1 (888 Varen)\n\nFor: Execution Option 2 (3 month period, unlimited VRN* *max treasury). \n\n",

This will continue the charitable path that the Varen community has so far established in regards to old holders.\n\nMotivation:\nThe remaining VRN were taken from the yVRN staking vault by a malicious actor, and as a result yVRN holders (called ‘victims’ in this prop) couldn’t withdraw the VRN they were expecting to be able to withdraw from the staking vault after the exploit.\n\nNot appealing to any responsibility on part of the current VRN project or team, but only appealing to the pity and graciousness of the VRN community, this proposal seeks to make the victims who came forward whole.\n\nSpecification:\nThis proposal concerns the affected stakers of the yVRN vault exploit. The process for reimbursement will be based on the following terms and conditions:\n\n- yVRN stakers must have been staked before block 15354169 with a minimum of 2 yVRN staked to qualify.\n- The window to claim will last 8 weeks from a date announced in the event this prop is successful.\n- The reimbursement will be at a ratio of 1 yVRN to 1 VRN.\n- In leiu of a required staking period the reimbursement will be sent out 90 days after the 8 week claim period ends.\n- Any unclaimed VRN will be transferred back to the VRN treasury after the claim period ends.\n\nExclude from reimbursement due to known linked transfers from the originating exploiter wallet:\n\nExploiter wallet\n0xc59d7e226c8f222e2142bf0f4b3efa83370f8cab\n\nKnown wallet(s) linked to exploiter\n0x689077055fb1bc733c708b1bf7c83d3939f949d7\n0xf0c2de0bfa3cbd56dab786e28fca1bcebc0de464\n\nVoting options:\n\nFor:\nExecute proposal, reserve 600 VRN based on 23 wallets that qualify on a minimum of 2 yVRN staked.\n\nAgainst:\nDo not execute the proposal, no governance funds will be moved for this purpose.",

I tell you my situation so that you can understand what some members of our community have suffered due to last month's attack. In my case, I had 89.6 YVRN staked in the vault, on August 17, 2022 I read the notice that the vault was compromised on Varen's Twitter account. After this I unstaked my VRN but I never received them in my metamask. One day earlier, on August 16, 2022, the attackers emptied the vault. For a matter of hours, I was unable to receive my VRN.\n\nI didn't know my VRN were compromised by an attacker until the same day I unstaked them, and I've lost all my funds, I have nothing more than that, I would like to recover them.\n\nAfter this incident, I quickly have asked for help to Discord support and they have advised me to submit a prop to the DAO for a reimbursement.\n\nThese are the tx:\n\n Stake 1 https://etherscan.io/tx/0x25b7d1ba3091f673536d90fe1023288d6485f669621e65653f93a94c4b6eb62f\n\n Stake 2\nhttps://etherscan.io/tx/0x33beb3ab7915abac10834107f1d883bfcac34901faedd5a5ac89595095907ae1\n\n Unstake \nhttps://etherscan.io/tx/0xbf3c9831649693d11b675ef7a178de6c3c378fbcd9138f6d5d031e9ed84f9f5f\n\n\nMotivation:\n\nThis proposal reveals a situation that has happened to many of us.

      "title": "VIP 9 - Introduction and Funding of the Varen Vaultless LP Program",
      "content": "## Abstract/Executive Summary\n\n* Herein we propose to implement and fund the Varen Vaultless LP model for the purpose of rewarding VRN-ETH liquidity providers for the next 90 day reward epoch.\n\n\n\n## Motivation\n\n* The Varen Vaultless LP model is designed to improve the useability and safety of providing VRN-ETH liquidity in the Varen ecosystem. By allowing users to maintain their SLP tokens in their own wallets this change will eliminate gas costs required for staking/unstaking as well as reducing contract risk by avoiding the need for a vault altogether. The multiplier feature will work to improve rewards for long term LPs in order to stabilize liquidity fluctuations over time. Additionally, the VRN-ETH SLP token voting will allow LPs to participate in Varen governance.\n\n\n\n## Specification\n\n* **1. Implementation of the Vaultless LP model:** \n\n   * Users will no longer need to stake their SLP tokens into a Vault, they will be able to keep their SLP tokens in their individual wallets reducing the gas cost of staking/unstaking and limiting contract risk by eliminating the vault entirely.\n\n   * SLP balances, and thus rewards, will be tracked and determined by frequent, randomized snapshots being taken to keep tabs on the holders of the SLP tokens. Rewards will then be calculated based on these snapshots.\n\n   * Rewards can be claimed via a Varen UI similar to the current model at the user’s convenience.\n\n   * **NOTE:** Rewards must be claimed within one year of being earned, unclaimed rewards beyond that will be returned to the rewards pool.\n\n\n\n* **2. Rewards Multiplier:**\n\n   * Reward levels will increase based on the length of time a user holds SLP tokens, assuming the amount doesn’t decrease.\n\n      * 1x Initial Reward Level (All LPs start at this level when epoch begins)\n\n      * 1.5x Reward Level after **4 weeks**\n\n      * 2x Reward Level after **8 weeks**\n\n      * 3x Reward Level after **16 weeks**\n\n\n\n* **3. Emission Levels and Funding:**\n\n   * The base level of emissions will be set at 10 VRN/day (assuming all SLP holders are at 1x rewards level.)\n\n   * The max level of emissions will be set at 30 VRN/day (assuming all SLP holders are at 2.5x rewards level.)\n\n   * This proposal seeks to authorize the allocation of 2700 VRN to fund the LP Reward program for 90 days.\n\n   * Since many SLP holders will not be at the max level, we expect there to be VRN left over after the 90 days. Any unused VRN will be rolled into the next 90 day epoch to support continued LP rewards.\n\n   * **NOTE:** The above values are based on approximate conversion from blocks to days. Actual values should be 90 days * ~6500 blocks/day = 585,000 blocks. Therefore, 10/day = 0.00154/block and 30/day = 0.00462/block.\n\n\n\n\n* **4. SLP Voting:**\n\n   * An additional benefit to allowing users to keep their SLP tokens in their own wallets is that VRN-ETH SLP holders will now be eligible to vote and participate in Varen Governance. This will no longer force holders to choose between providing liquidity and participating in the governance of the project.\n\n   * VRN-ETH SLP voting will be weighted so that the SLP voters vote based on the underlying VRN in their LP position to maintain maximum fairness in the voting process.\n\n\n\n\n## Voting options\n\n* For\n\n   * Execute proposal; authorize the implementation of the Varen Vaultless LP Program and earmark 2,700 VRN for this purpose.\n\n* Against\n\n   * Do not execute the proposal. No actions will be taken.",

Open voting to all holders of VRN to broaden participation in the governance of the Varen DAO.\n   * 3. Change the voting quorum to 10% of all eligible voters to reflect the larger vote base.\n\n   Note: The Protocol Owned Liquidity program wallet will also be set up at this time.\n\n\n* **Phase 2: Reorganization of Tokenomics**\n\n\n   Once DAO simplification is complete we will proceed into the second phase, the reorganization of Varen Tokenomics, which will be focused on using revenue to build up Protocol Owned Liquidity to support renAssets being traded on VarenX in order to facilitate higher volumes with less slippage.\n\n   Varen tokenomics will be reorganized by means of the following three initiatives:\n\n   * 1. Retire the Governance Vault and move to a Buy Back and Burn mechanic in which revenue from Varen products will eventually be employed to market buy VRN and burn it, reducing supply. Similar to the model used by MakerDAO (without the auction mechanic), this will align the incentives between VRN token holders and the governance of the Varen DAO.\n   * 2. Creation of a Protocol Owned Liquidity program designed to build up liquidity in the VRN-ETH pool and other LP pools that will support Varen products.\n\n   During this phase 100% of revenue will be directed to the Protocol Owned Liquidity program as described below.\n\n\n   **Focus Assets:**\n\n   * renBTC Liquidity Goal: $500k\n\n   * renLuna Liquidity Goal: $500k\n\n   * renDoge Liquidity Goal: $500k\n\n   **Non-focus Assets:**\n\n   * Other Cross-Chain assets Liquidity Goal: $100k\n\n   Revenue in specific renAssets will be sent directly to the appropriate pool, with half sold for ETH to pair with the remaining renAssets, until that pool’s liquidity goal is reached. Once the goal is reached, the renAssets that would have gone to that pool will be directed to the other Focus Asset pools until they reach their goals. Once all 3 Focus Asset goals are hit the plan will move into the third phase.\n\n   Additionally, we propose to authorize the OTC of up to 200 VRN when favorable to provide seed funds to Focus Asset pools in order to jump start the build up of the POL program.\n\n   As other revenue streams are developed as part of the Varen ecosystem they will also follow this plan by contributing toward building toward liquidity goals in order to accelerate the process.\n\n\n\n*   **Phase 3: Burn & Build**\n\n   The third phase will be the transition to the desired long term revenue distribution model for the Varen project. Our goal is to introduce revenue distribution flexibility to efficiently utilize revenue to build value and support the Varen ecosystem and products. This will be accomplished by directing revenue generated to the following three categories depending on project needs (note: these allocation percentages may be changed by future governance proposals as needed):\n\n\n* **1. Buy Back and Burn (70% of Protocol Revenue):**\n\n   -70% of fees will be used to market buy VRN and burn it. This will provide consistent buy pressure and will reduce the circulating supply of VRN over time.\n\n* **2. Protocol Owned Liquidity (20% of Protocol Revenue):**\n\n   -20% of fees will be used to continue building liquidity. After the initial Focus Asset phase the VRN-ETH pool will be added as a priority pool in order to slowly lessen the need for LP incentivization, which ideally will reduce LP incentive VRN emission in the long run.\n\n* **3. Treasury Diversification (10% of Protocol Revenue):**\n\n   -10% of fees will be used to bolster and diversify the treasury. These funds will be held in ETH or Stablecoins to ensure the treasury is able to adequately and efficiently fund project development in a variety of market conditions. These funds will be considered part of the treasury and, thus, can only be allocated via Varen governance.\n\n",

      "title": "VIP 9 - Introduction and Funding of the Varen Vaultless LP Program",
      "content": "\n\n## Abstract/Executive Summary\n\n* Herein we propose to implement and fund the Varen Vaultless LP model for the purpose of rewarding VRN-ETH liquidity providers for the next 90 day reward epoch.\n\n\n\n## Motivation\n\n* The Varen Vaultless LP model is designed to improve the useability and safety of providing VRN-ETH liquidity in the Varen ecosystem. By allowing users to maintain their SLP tokens in their own wallets this change will eliminate gas costs required for staking/unstaking as well as reducing contract risk by avoiding the need for a vault altogether. The multiplier feature will work to improve rewards for long term LPs in order to stabilize liquidity fluctuations over time. Additionally, the VRN-ETH SLP token voting will allow LPs to participate in Varen governance.\n\n\n\n## Specification\n\n* **1. Implementation of the Vaultless LP model:** \n\n   * Users will no longer need to stake their SLP tokens into a Vault, they will be able to keep their SLP tokens in their individual wallets reducing the gas cost of staking/unstaking and limiting contract risk by eliminating the vault entirely.\n\n   * SLP balances, and thus rewards, will be tracked and determined by frequent, randomized snapshots being taken to keep tabs on the holders of the SLP tokens. Rewards will then be calculated based on these snapshots.\n\n   * Rewards can be claimed via a Varen UI similar to the current model at the user’s convenience.\n\n   * **NOTE:** Rewards must be claimed within one year of being earned, unclaimed rewards beyond that will be returned to the rewards pool.\n\n\n\n* **2. Rewards Multiplier:**\n\n   * Reward levels will increase based on the length of time a user holds SLP tokens, assuming the amount doesn’t decrease.\n\n      * 1x Initial Reward Level (All LPs start at this level when epoch begins)\n\n      * 1.5x Reward Level after **4 weeks**\n\n      * 2x Reward Level after **8 weeks**\n\n      * 3x Reward Level after **16 weeks**\n\n\n\n* **3. Emission Levels and Funding:**\n\n   * The base level of emissions will be set at 10 VRN/day (assuming all SLP holders are at 1x rewards level.)\n\n   * The max level of emissions will be set at 30 VRN/day (assuming all SLP holders are at 2.5x rewards level.)\n\n   * This proposal seeks to authorize the allocation of 2700 VRN to fund the LP Reward program for 90 days.\n\n   * Since many SLP holders will not be at the max level, we expect there to be VRN left over after the 90 days. Any unused VRN will be rolled into the next 90 day epoch to support continued LP rewards.\n\n   * **NOTE:** The above values are based on approximate conversion from blocks to days. Actual values should be 90 days * ~6500 blocks/day = 585,000 blocks. Therefore, 10/day = 0.00154/block and 30/day = 0.00462/block.\n\n\n\n\n* **4. SLP Voting:**\n\n   * An additional benefit to allowing users to keep their SLP tokens in their own wallets is that VRN-ETH SLP holders will now be eligible to vote and participate in Varen Governance. This will no longer force holders to choose between providing liquidity and participating in the governance of the project.\n\n   * VRN-ETH SLP voting will be weighted so that the SLP voters vote based on the underlying VRN in their LP position to maintain maximum fairness in the voting process.\n\n\n\n\n## Voting options\n\n* For\n\n   * Execute proposal; authorize the implementation of the Varen Vaultless LP Program and earmark 2,700 VRN for this purpose.\n\n* Against\n\n   * Do not execute the proposal. No actions will be taken.",

      "title": "VIP 8 - Core Team allocation Q1-Q2 2022 ",
      "content": "Proposal on forum: https://forum.varen.finance/t/vip-8-core-team-allocation-q1-q2-2022/40\n\nAbstract/Executive Summary\nHerein we request to budget 2,500 VRN from the Varen DAO treasury to continue development on VarenX and further endeavours as the core team in Q1-Q2. Furthermore, we propose the Varen DAO to formally join the Ren ecosystem.\n\nMotivation\nSince VIP 1 on the rebrand to Varen, the core team has delivered on the main thrust of that proposal: launching VarenX, a cross-chain swapping dApp leveraging RenVM bridging technology and solidifying ourselves as a leading partner in the Ren ecosystem.\n\nOur overarching vision for VarenX is to make cross-chain DeFi as accessible and liquid as possible for all users, and with VarenX v1 we have made the first step in achieving this. Users don’t have to go to different platforms to bridge their assets first, then swap on DEXes to achieve native cross-chain swaps. With VarenX this is now possible in one interface, with a couple of clicks, all in a single transaction.\n\nThis is the vision we will continue to push forward. Swapping continues to be the main DeFi primitive, and reducing UX friction in cross-multi-chain swapping will be one of the big narratives moving into 2022.\n\nVarenX v2 development\nThe main development goals for VarenX in 2022 are fivefold: Ren’s Host-to-Host, Layer 2 support, Gas-as-a-Service (GaaS), VarenX-as-a-Service (VaaS), and co-development of the Ren Labs ecosystem.\n\nWe are working closely with the Ren team to integrate the host-to-host functionality into VarenX v2, of which you can find a full description of the features here 3. In addition, we will be focusing on integrating popular Layer 2’s such as Polygon, Binance Smart Chain and Arbitrum. The overall aim here is to have the user be able to do cross-chain swaps with the lowest fees possible.\n\nA next feature to be added to VarenX is Gas-as-a-Service by integrating the OpenZeppelin Gas Station Network (GSN) 2. This will enable users to execute cross-chain swaps on VarenX without ever having to have ETH in their Ethereum wallet by having the incoming native asset cover the gas fees to execute the swap.\n\nAnother aim for this year is to offer VarenX-as-a-service, by integrating our VarenX smart contracts with third party apps, accessing their existing user base. This will generate volume for VarenX and RenVM, while giving new users access to the power of cross-chain DeFi.\n\nFinally, we will also be focusing on the challenge of cross-chain liquidity with Ren Labs. Learning from the experiences of other DeFi projects, we are looking to help develop an interoperability layer which can access liquidity across chains. This year we will look to work with Ren on this challenging topic…\n\nContracted dev roster\nFor continued development of VarenX we will be and have been aggressively bringing high quality developers into the fold and will work on a per project basis with these developers. Currently, these developers are PapaKalash (currently working on the VarenX Explorer), Pineapple Workshop (who developed the frontend for VarenX), and 0xburden (currently working on the Polygon integration). This roster is subject to changes over time.\n\nJoining Ren\nBuilding on our partnership, moving forward Varen will function as the premiere UI/UX-focused team within the Ren ecosystem, positioning Varen as the official main hub and first stop for anything and everything Ren.\n\nWhat does this mean practically? It means that we’re deepening our collaboration with Ren beyond the current partnership structure. As Varen, we will be onboarded and nested within the internal Ren development structure and will have first access to new RenJS code.\n\nWe’ll be developing in sync with the Ren development team, sharing resources where applicable, and increasingly taking on additional frontend development responsibilities of Ren products, and help build out a Ren-focused cross-chain liquidity strategy.\n\nWe will also be coordinating with and assisting other Ren Labs projects such as Catalog Finance, to ensure that we always build in synergy and unison with other Ren Labs teams, with the goal of growing adoption of Ren-built dApps and technology. We do all of this while retaining our independence and autonomy as Varen DAO.\n\nCore team expansion\nAdditionally, we propose Ad Astra to join the core team as community lead. As council member Ad Astra has been instrumental in pushing the Varen community forward, is proactive at addressing community issues and proposing new directions to activate the Varen community. Also, Linkie is fully back from hiatus starting Q1. So, the final Varen core team is as follows:\n\nPalis - product & business development\nMorty - operations & communications\nLinkie Link - frontend development & integrations\nCasss - UX/UI design & marketing\nAd Astra - community management & outreach\n\nCore team discretion\nDue to market conditions, development realities, and other opportunities, the core team has invoked its VIP 1 discretionary powers at different points in time during the past months. We propose to retain discretion to change course and strategies, for the good of VarenX and the Varen DAO.\n\nSpecification\nTo achieve the aforementioned goals for Q1 and Q2 core team requests the following allocation:\n\n- 1000 VRN to replenish the dev fund, mainly earmarked to pay the Varen roster of developers, and any other protocol supporting activities such as marketing and bounties\n- 50 VRN monthly to each of the 5 core team members\n\nThis amounts to a total of 2,500 VRN (~2.8% of supply) allocated to core team operations for Q1-Q2 of 2022, to be disbursed to the following dev fund address: 0x669aecf6152227f4f13dbee0db753975ca88f721\n\nVoting options\n\nFor\nExecute VIP 8. Allocate 2,500 Varen to core team goals stated in VIP 8\n\nAgainst\nDo not execute VIP 8",

In order to incentivize community members to step up and take on tasks of this nature we are requesting funding to put into place a tier incentive program to reward these community members.\n\n  - An example of what the tiers may look like initially (subject to change based on needs and pricing of VRN)\n    - Tier 1: Possibly complex/time consuming/techinical - 1.0 VRN\n    - Tier 2: More involved task/possibly technical in nature - 0.5 VRN\n    - Tier 3: Minor task/Non-technical - 0.25 VRN\n\n**Specification**\n\n  - In order to enact this incentive program, it is proposed that 40 VRN be earmarked for Bounty Board purposes. This initial funding request is estimated to last for between 3-6 months of operation the bounty program. The 40 VRN will be sent from the treasury to a wallet controlled by the Community Council.

The series will be distributed based on a pair of snapshots to be taken at non-disclosed times between the passing of this proposal and Oct 15, 2021. The NFT drop will be done based on 3 tiers based on the amount of liquidity provided by the individual LPs. There will be a lower limit for LPs to qualify of 10 VRN and equivalent ETH.\n\n**Specification**\n\n  - **Execution:**\n      - The team will commision artist(s) to produce 3 different branded Varen pieces.

(i.e. top 3 to Founders, next 5 to Vanguard, next 25 to Harbinger)\n    - On or soon after Oct 25, 2021 the NFTs will be dropped to the LPs based on the rankings\n    - In the event that there are fewer qualifying LPs than total NFTs (33) then the remaining NFTs will be remanded to the control of the treasury for future promotional purposes.\n\n  - **Funding:**\n    - For the purposes of commissioning the art, minting the NFTs and covering gas costs for the NFT drop this proposal requests approximately 3 ETH to carry out the proposed NFT incentive program.\n\n\n**Voting options:**\n\n  - **For:**\n\n    - Execute proposal and allocate approximately 3 ETH for this purpose from the Treasury\n\n  - **Against:**\n\n    - Do not execute proposal.

There is currently no end date set for the migration.\nAt the time of this writing 25,927 VRN remain unclaimed.\nIt is relatively safe to assume that people that haven’t migrated yet are either no longer interested in VRN (have written funds off) or completely lost access to their wallets.\nYFL represents our past, but it is now time to move on to the new community and the future products we will have in front of us.\nAs long as we have that migration open there is going to be a connection to the bad past and we leave it open to all sorts of interpretations.\n\nSpecification\n\nVoters can choose from 3 proposed dates for the end of the migration:\n• October 10, 2021\n• January 1st, 2022\n• May 10, 2022\n\nBased on the selected date, 2 weeks before that the “announceMigrationEnd” is called by treasury signalling 2 more weeks before migration is ended.\nOn the date chose by voters treasury calls “closeMigration”.\nMigration is closed and per the contract implementation all remaining unmigrated VRN is returned to treasury.\n\nGiven that there is a difference of opinion on how to better use those funds I am editing this to clarify that how those funds should be used will be decided as a separate prop and at a later date and it’s not in the scope of the current one.",

      "content": "\n# Draft – Proposal – VRN Governance Overhaul and Community Council Formation\n\n\n\n\n* * * \n## **Abstract:**\n\n* This proposal sets out to take the first steps in building out the community contribution \tcapabilities of the Varen project. The goal of this prop is to seek authorization to review and \toverhaul the governance policies of YFL to suit the new Varen project direction as well as the \tformation of a Community Council to catalyze and organize the community contributions to the \tproject.\n* * * \n\n## **Motivation:**\n\n* As we navigate this migration and the transition to Varen it is necessary to update the \tgovernance policies and procedures to both reflect the needs of the community and how it has \tevolved since the early days of YFL as well as the new Tokenomics and direction of the project as \tit moves forward. This transition also gives us the opportunity to reimagine the impact that the \tcommunity at large can have on the growth and development of the project via direct \tcontribution, organization building and dev team support, as well as to begin building a frame \twork in which that impact can be realized.\n\n *I propose that this process be kicked off by authorizing three actions that should benefit the \tproject going forward.*\n\n\n1. The overhaul of YFL Governance policies and procedures to better fit the new direction of Varen.\n\n2.\tFormation of a 3-person Community Council to catalyze, organize and guide the efforts of the community to contribute to the advancement of the project.\n3.\tFormation of an informal Advisory group made up of past council members and outside advisors\n\n*Benefits to the token holder:*\n\n* Improved communication between the community and devs.\n\n* Resolution of concerns/grievances and lessening of FUD.\n\n* Representation of general token holder interests.\n\n* Offer a more tangible pathway to contribution for community members that \t\t\t\tare interested.\n\n*Benefits to the dev team/project/treasury:*\n\n* Development of a Bounty Program to leverage and organize community \t\t\t\tresources to perform project-wide goal-oriented tasks.\n\n* Improve project longevity by decentralizing project’s institutional \t\t\t\t\tknowledge/experience.\n\n* Insulate dev team from non-essential outside interference by acting as a buffer \t\t\t\tfor FUD and other distractions.\n\n* * * \n## **Specifications:**\n### 1.\tGovernance Overhaul:\n\n* Maintain minimal rules from YFL Governance:\n    - 20% Quorum.\n    - YFL Governance to continue to act as guidance until new governance \n\tapproved.\n- Within 1 month develop and present a rough framework for governance based \non the YFL Policies to guide the project through the early post-migration process (including a more comprehensive framework for the functioning of the council and council members).\n- Within 4 months develop and present for approval a fully developed Governance Policy for approval and adoption by the project and community.\n\n### 2.\tFormation of a 3-person Community Council:\n- Acting as a conduit for more organized communication between the community and the dev team by both filtering out spam and unnecessary chatter that can distract the dev team as well as giving a stronger platform for ideas, questions and concerns that the community has. This will also include a monthly blog post to be put together in collaboration with the dev team.\n- Working with the dev team on outreach for listings, marketing, etc.\n- Investigation and development of a Bounty program to organize community efforts.\n\t\t\n    **Community Council General Information:**\n    * Term:\t\t\t6 months\n    * Term-Limit:\t\t2 Consecutive Terms\n\n    **Community Council Duties:**\n    * General Duties:\n        * Advise community members on proposal procedures and governance \t\t\t\t\tprocesses as well as direct the effort to develop new governance policies.\n        * Strengthen the communication between the community and the dev team.\n        * Collaborate with the dev team in directing the community on outreach efforts \t\t\t\tfor listings, marketing, or inter project cooperation.\t\t\t\n        * Investigation and development of community projects that can add value to \t\t\t\tthe Varen project.\n\t\t\t\n    * Bi-weekly meeting/briefing with Dev team:\n        * This meeting will include bringing of community ideas/input/concerns to the \t\t\t\tdevs as well as giving the devs a platform to run ideas of their own past \t\t\t\t\trepresentatives of the community. \n\t\t\t\n    * Monthly Project/Community Blog Post:\n        * The council will be responsible for collaborating with the community and dev \t\t\t\tteam to put together a monthly project wide update blog post.\n\n\n\n**Community Council Election Implementation:**\n\n* Candidacy Period:\n   * The Candidacy Period shall last for 3 days. Interested candidates may make it \t\t\t\tknow that they are interested in serving by notifying a designated party (this \t\t\t\tparty will be announced). Community members who are not interested in \t\t\t\tserving at this time are encouraged to nominate other members who they feel \t\t\t\twould be good contributors. Candidates that have volunteered and have \t\t\t\treceived at least 1 nomination will be considered official Candidates and eligible \t\t\tfor election.\n\n    * Voting Period:\n        * The Voting period will last for 6-days. Due to the nature of Snapshot, ranked \t\t\t\tchoice or multiple choice voting is not currently feasible. So the election will be \t\t\t\tperformed as 3 consecutive runoff style elections. For example, during the first \t\t\t\t48 hour period all eligible candidates will be placed on the ballot and voters will \t\t\t\thave 47 hours to vote (1 hour set aside to reset for the next day’s \t\t\t\t\telection). At the end of the 48 hours the candidate with the highest vote total \t\t\t\twill be added to the council. The remaining candidates will then be put onto the \t\t\t\tballot for the next day’s election. This will be repeated 2 more times to decide \t\t\t\tthe 3 members off the council. The 2nd-4th highest recipients of votes on the 3rd \t\t\t\tballot will automatically be nominated for the next council election, should they \t\t\t\twish to run.\n\n        * The Voting period will last for 6-days.

      "content": "**Abstract/Executive Summary**\nHerein we propose to migrate the VRN liquidity owned by the protocol from Varen DEX to Sushiswap, and begin a transition to retire the Varen DEX previously known as Linkswap\n\n**Motivation**\nDuring development of the new product leveraging RenVM technology to achieve cross-chain swaps the core team has noted that building this product on top of Varen DEX leads to multiple issues:\n\n- Requiring large amounts of capital to catch up on network effects and liquidity from leading DEXes\n- Low liquidity leads to poor user experience, in other words, expensive swap rates for users of our product\n- Lack of stable price oracle if certain pools have low liquidity\n\nThis has led the team to propose the following approach. First, we are proposing to migrate the VRN liquidity owned by the protocol to Sushiswap. Second, we are proposing to begin the process of retiring Varen DEX, a relic from a long departed founding team. The products of Varen Suite will be built on established market leaders to capitalise on their network effects.\n\nUsing the AutoPools feature we can add staking of Sushiswap LP tokens on Varen. An incentivized VRN/ETH pool will be added to Varen where you can stake your Sushiswap LP tokens for VRN rewards. Additionally, we will work to implement a VRN distribution in every future product of the Varen suite, to incentivise staking in the governance vault.\n\nFinally, the core team is requesting $10,000 to repay Linkie for testing costs he incurred in January while testing an LP pool, where a bot sniped his funds. See Discord for link to txn.\n\n**Specification**\nCore team will migrate the full amount of VRN liquidity owned by the protocol currently on Varen DEX to Sushiswap.\n\nPrevious UI for the DEX will be available at linkswap.app.\n\n$10,000 will be transferred to Linkie Link’s address\n\n**Voting options**\n\nFor\n\nExecute proposal. Move VRN liquidity to Sushiswap and start retirement of Varen DEX. Transfer 10,000 to Linkie Link\n\nAgainst\n\nDo not execute proposal. Nothing happens",

      "title": "VIP2 - Governance Overhaul and Community Council Formation",
      "content": "## Abstract:\n\n* This proposal sets out to take the first steps in building out the community contribution capabilities of the Varen project. The goal of this prop is to seek authorization to review and overhaul the governance policies of YFL to suit the new Varen project direction as well as the formation of a Community Council to catalyze and organize the community contributions to the project.\n\n## Motivation:\n\n* As we navigate this migration and the transition to Varen it is necessary to update the governance policies and procedures to both reflect the needs of the community and how it has evolved since the early days of YFL as well as the new Tokenomics and direction of the project as it moves forward. This transition also gives us the opportunity to reimagine the impact that the community at large can have on the growth and development of the project via direct contribution, organization building and dev team support, as well as to begin building a frame work in which that impact can be realized.\n\n*I propose that this process be kicked off by authorizing three actions that should benefit the project going forward.*\n\n* The overhaul of YFL Governance policies and procedures to better fit the new direction of Varen.\n\n* Formation of a 3-person Community Council to catalyze, organize and guide the efforts of the community to contribute to the advancement of the project.\n\n* Formation of an informal Advisory group made up of past council members and outside advisors\n\n*Benefits to the token holder:*\n\n* Improved communication between the community and devs.\n\n* Resolution of concerns/grievances and lessening of FUD.\n\n* Representation of general token holder interests.\n\n* Offer a more tangible pathway to contribution for community members that are interested.\n\n*Benefits to the dev team/project/treasury:*\n\n* Development of a Bounty Program to leverage and organize community resources to perform project-wide goal-oriented tasks.\n\n* Improve project longevity by decentralizing project’s institutional knowledge/experience.\n\n* Insulate dev team from non-essential outside interference by acting as a buffer for FUD and other distractions.\n\n## Specifications:\n### 1. Governance Overhaul:\n* Maintain minimal rules from YFL Governance:\n    * 20% Quorum.\n    * YFL Governance to continue to act as guidance until new governance\napproved.\n    * Within 1 month develop and present a rough framework for governance based\non the YFL Policies to guide the project through the early post-migration process (including a more comprehensive framework for the functioning of the council and council members).\n    * Within 4 months develop and present for approval a fully developed Governance Policy for approval and adoption by the project and community.\n### 2. Formation of a 3-person Community Council:\n* Acting as a conduit for more organized communication between the community and the dev team by both filtering out spam and unnecessary chatter that can distract the dev team as well as giving a stronger platform for ideas, questions and concerns that the community has. This will also include a monthly blog post to be put together in collaboration with the dev team.\n\n* Working with the dev team on outreach for listings, marketing, etc.\n\n* Investigation and development of a Bounty program to organize community efforts.\n\n#### Community Council General Information:\n* Term: 6 months\n* Term-Limit: 2 Consecutive Terms\n\n#### Community Council Duties:\n* General Duties:\n\n    * Advise community members on proposal procedures and governance processes as well as direct the effort to develop new governance policies.\n    * Strengthen the communication between the community and the dev team.\n    * Collaborate with the dev team in directing the community on outreach efforts for listings, marketing, or inter project cooperation.\n    * Investigation and development of community projects that can add value to the Varen project.\n\n* Bi-weekly meeting/briefing with Dev team:\n\n    * This meeting will include bringing of community ideas/input/concerns to the devs as well as giving the devs a platform to run ideas of their own past representatives of the community.\n\n* Monthly Project/Community Blog Post:\n\n    * The council will be responsible for collaborating with the community and dev team to put together a monthly project wide update blog post.\n\n#### Community Council Election Implementation:\n* Candidacy Period:\n\n    * The Candidacy Period shall last for 3 days. Interested candidates may make it know that they are interested in serving by notifying a designated party (this party will be announced). Community members who are not interested in serving at this time are encouraged to nominate other members who they feel would be good contributors. Candidates that have volunteered and have received at least 1 nomination will be considered official Candidates and eligible for election.\n\n* Voting Period:\n\n    * The Voting period will last for 6-days. Due to the nature of Snapshot, ranked choice or multiple choice voting is not currently feasible. So the election will be performed as 3 consecutive runoff style elections. For example, during the first 48 hour period all eligible candidates will be placed on the ballot and voters will have 47 hours to vote (1 hour set aside to reset for the next day’s election). At the end of the 48 hours the candidate with the highest vote total will be added to the council. The remaining candidates will then be put onto the ballot for the next day’s election. This will be repeated 2 more times to decide the 3 members of the council. The 2nd-4th highest recipients of votes on the 3rd ballot will automatically be nominated for the next council election, should they wish to run.\n\n### 3. Formation of an Informal Advisory Group:\n* In order to draw from community and professional resources we will maintain an informal group of advisors made up of professionals (business, academic, etc.) as well as former council members to act as a resource to the team, council and community.\n\n## Outcomes:\n* For:\n\n    * Establishment of a Community Council and Initiation of the Governance Overhaul Process.\n* Against:\n\n    * No change.",

      "content": "Proposal here: https://gov.yflink.io/t/live-proposal-yf-link-rebrand-and-pivot-to-varen/399\n\n**Abstract/Executive Summary**\nHerein we propose a full rebrand and product development pivot of the YF Link protocol to Varen\n\n**Motivation**\n\n*Rebrand overview*\nVaren, or Varenne originally, was considered the dark horse in trotter racing. Always coming up from behind, before eventually going on to become a legendary racing horse. This is our thesis: build quietly, focus on a long term sustainable ecosystem, and dedicate to building high quality code, immersive user experience, and accessible information to push the defi user experience and user value forward. Our vision for Varen is to be an Ethereum-based multi-chain DeFi hub, with a focus on bringing multi-chain services to retail DeFi users.\n\nThe full visual overview of the new branding can be seen here: https://varen.finance/branding-guide.pdf\n\n*Varen Development Phases*\nWe have defined the development phases over the next few weeks and months as follows. Please note that these phases do overlap.\n\nPhase 0 - Token migration\nWe are currently in the midst of our migration and will remain so for as long as there’s $YFL out there that needs to be swapped to $VRN. There are active VRN/ETH and VRN/USDC pools on the Varen (Linkswap) DEX.\n\nPhase 1 - Rebrand, liquidity mining, gov vault\nIn this phase we execute a full rebrand of our DEX, websites and communications channels as defined in the previous section. We will begin actively pushing our rebrand to Coingecko, Coinmarketcap, DeFiPulse and other important integrations.\n\nWe also launch new reward pools to build up the liquidity necessary for a healthy DEX and subsequent development phases. The reward pools planned are as of now, but not limited to:\n\nVRN/ETH\n\nVRN/USDC\n\nETH/USDC\n\nLINK/USDC\n\nrenBTC/ETH\n\nrenDOGE/ETH\n\nrenFIL/ETH\n\nWe will also redeploy our governance vault with staking rewards from the Varen DEX protocol fee and additional rewards.\n\nPhase 2 - Multi-chain DeFi hub (bridges + AMM)\nBuilding on our earlier successful integrations of the Ren and Secret Network bridges, we continue this path by building a user friendly bridge ‘aggregator’-type interface that leverages Ren bridge technology into a multi-chain bridge on top of an AMM as a method of moving liquidity from Ethereum to destinations like the Bitcoin network, Dogecoin, Binance Smart Chain, Polygon (Matic), Fantom, Solana, Avalanche and others. The goal here is to create a place where DeFi chain hoppers can come and bridge to and from many common L1 or L2 chains, and support that process with DEX liquidity.\n\nPhase 3 - VRN Staking 2.0\nIn the third phase we bring together what we’ve built with a product directing additional protocol revenue to stakers participating in protocol governance. The product in development would bring new optimizations for capital efficiency in DEXes. Specific details around this product will be released as product development matures. Additionally, in expansion of our partnerships where we host vetting projects as a part of our ecosystem, we are exploring expanding this partner program. Currently we are in discussions with a large upcoming project, who are looking to launch this year exclusively hosted on Varen Suite. We are still working out how the two projects create synergistic value and incentives, but as we look to build a multi-chain, multi-services defi hub and ecosystem, we welcome this form of partnership and look to continue expanding with high quality vetted partners.\n\n*Core team discretion and community council*\nTo ensure flexibility and agility, the core team requests discretion to execute the vision articulated in this proposal, with regular input from the community as guidance. We will be supporting a proposal to instate a community council to this end that will interface with the core team to represent community input into product and business development.\n\nA detailed proposal for the operation of this council will follow, as well as further updates to the functioning of governance moving forward. Community member Ad Astra is taking the lead in this. As part of this initiative, members of the community as well as professional advisors will form a council for project advisory board and community oversight.\n\nAdditionally, the team will be hiring a secretary for the DAO. This will be a paid role and will involve tracking all transactions in and out for the treasury multi-sig and dev fund wallet, and these tracking sheets will be fully accessible at all times to the community council for audit or questions. We will also be publishing an expenses report, which will be accessible to the public but will include less information than the version accessible to the community council in order to respect the privacy of vendors, contractors and other partners.\n\nWith a core team driving product development, we would like to continue operating with an ethos of community-driven decentralized governance, and we hope the open and engaged methods at Varen can create a balance between streamlined business initiatives and community participation. In addition to the product development of the Varen team, we plan to continue operating with DAO-supported high quality community initiatives, such as a bounty-program to leverage and organize community resources to perform project-wide goal-oriented tasks.\n\nCore team reserves the right to pivot the above strategy as market conditions and development schedules need.\n\n**Specification**\n\n*Funding allocation*\nThere are 39,888 $VRN tokens currently sitting in treasury to be allocated to development of the Varen protocol and will be allocated as such after passage of this proposal. The community voted to add these tokens to the treasury with the intent to support the growth of the protocol for years to come. The tokens allocated to liquidity mining & staking rewards are for partnerships and strategic liquidity plays as they arise over the foreseeable future, and will only be allocated as such when attached to a clear purpose and always safeguarding the health and resiliency of the protocol.\n\nLiquidity mining & staking rewards: 32,000\nDev fund: 1,444\nTreasury: 4,000\nCore team allocation 1,444:\n– 1,244 tokens or 311 per member vested monthly from June 2021 to Jan 2022\n– Retroactive payout as compensation for 2 core team members of 100 tokens each for work from Nov 2020 - May 2021\n\n**Voting options**\nThis vote will be the first vote with VRN. Until the VRN Staking Vault is relaunched, we’ll use unstaked VRN for the vote. The quorum is calculated by 20% of the migrated VRN at the block when the vote is created.\n\n*For*\nApprove this proposal. Core team executes this proposal ie. the vision, rebrand, phases, discretion and funding allocation\n\n*Against*\nReject this proposal. Nothing happens",
