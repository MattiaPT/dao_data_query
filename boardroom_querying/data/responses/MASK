      "title": "[Proposal] Mask grant and ecosystem program budget request",
      "content": "This is an initial funding proposal for the Mask Grant requesting budgetary funds for a series of ecosystem programs. The snapshot proposal will last 3 days from August 30 at 10:00:00AM to September 2 EST at 10:00:00AM (Proposal ends with 50% pass). \n\n## TL;DR\nIn order to further expand the Mask ecosystem in a more systematic way, Mask team would like to propose to distribute $MASK worth of 1 million USD funds to Mask ecosystem programs including:\n\n 1. Mask Grant program ($MASK worth of 500k USD)\n 2. Gitcoin Grant  ($MASK worth of 200k USD)\n 3. Hackathon/Scholarship  ($MASK worth of 250k USD)\n 4. Bounty ($MASK worth of 50k USD)\n\nThe Funds will be distributed through roughly a 1-year-duration. They can be renewed or increased upon review.\n\n## Vision\n\nMask’s mission is to nurture cutting-edge applications in Web3 and has been actively shaping the future of the field since 2019. Mask has funded many projects to grow and scale, which has driven the mass adoption of the decentralized internet. We want to solidify our position in web3 social and stick to our vision of data ownership where regular everyday users will be able to control their own on-chain identity, privacy and data.\n\nTo this cause, Mask wants to provide a fund of $MASK token equivalent to 1 million USD to support early-stage projects. We have 4 programs allocated as the following:\n- Mask Grant program (500k USD worth of $MASK, with 10+ candidates) \n- Gitcoin Grant (200k USD worth of $MASK, already allocated 50k)\n- Scholarship/Hackathon (250k USD worth of $MASK)\n- Bounty program (50k USD worth of $MASK)\n\n## Programs Overview\n \n![](https://s3.bmp.ovh/imgs/2022/08/30/61733600a5767b36.png)\n    \n* Mask grant application link: [Mask ecosystem Notion page](https://www.notion.so/8170b5ed7e7f4424b45c060377108396)\n* Gitcoin grant [Link](https://gitcoin.co/grants/new)\n* Info about scholarship: https://twitter.com/suji_yan/status/1464929882257772545\n* Bounty application link: [All bounties](https://gitcoin.co/dimensiondev/bounties)\n* Investment fund email: bonfire@mask.io\n\nInternally, Mask Network offered dedicated funding programs like Mask Grant and Scholarship to encourage college dropout students, public goods and ecosystem projects. In the past few months, Mask has hosted major events like ETHShanghai Hackathon.\n\nExternally, for the first half of the year, we’ve sponsored Gitcoin GR14 web3 social round and Moonshot hackathon. We look forward to sponsoring more Web3-themed events like Gitcoin GR15, etc.\n\n* Refer to the Mask Ecosystem notion page [here](https://mask.notion.site/Mask-Ecosystem-Overview-public-page-8170b5ed7e7f4424b45c060377108396)\n* Refer to the Mask Grant program notion page [here] (https://mask.notion.site/Mask-Grant-Program-4b177b18925f4c57b2346d6ec85e641d)\n\n## Metrics and KPIs\n- Fund 50 grant projects in Web3 social and public good area in 1 year\n- Introduce 100+ projects into the Mask ecosystem, including Mask browser Extension and Next.ID via all sorts of programs above\n- Grow users of the ecosystem products to the next level\n\n## How Voting Will Work (Pass with 50% approvals)\nSelect the option based on the initiatives above\n[ ] yes\n[ ] no\n\n## Conclusion\nMask will support early-stage projects, build the Web3 social ecosystem, and bring Web3 dapps to large scale of people. Thank you for taking the time to consider our proposal and the commitments we have put forth for Grant Program. We look forward to answering any questions you may have and ensuring our work is closely aligned to the expectations of the Mask DAO.\n",

Users can mint p-assets, such as pETH, pUSD by collateralizing NEST/ETH, etc.\n\nParasset combines some features from both MakerDAO and Liquity. It can collect revenue through the stability fees like in MakerDAO, while it has an Insurance Pool which plays a role similar to the Stability Pool in the Liquity, making the risk control even better. Parasset uses fully decentralized oracle NEST, making it contain unique applications for price quotation miners.\n\nThe Insurance Fund keeps the parallel assets and the underlying assets in a 1:1 equivalence relationship. The increase in the size of the pool reinforces the anchoring of the value of the parallel assets to the underlying assets.\n\nThe Insurance Fund LP Earns 4 Types of Returns: Transaction fee of 0.2%, Stability fee, Liquidation residual value and ASET.\n\n**Investors:**\nHuobi Ventures, FBG Capital, OKEx Blockdream Ventures, 21DAO, AU21, Gravity Resource, LD Capital, Infinity Labs, HOT LABS, Kernel Ventures, LINKVC, Kyros Ventures, All For Ventures, 100X Capital, YBB.

      "title": "Approve MaskDAO to pursue strategic swaps with holdings",
      "content": "**Summary**\n\nMask Team proposes to pursue strategic token swaps with a 5 million $Mask (~$50 million) first fund. **The goal is to strengthen ties with partner projects, diversify Mask treasury as well as provide financial returns.** The swap targets will be partner projects in the Web 3.0 space that could range from infrastructures to applications with similar or even more upside than Mask.\n\n\n**Background**\nMask Network wants to give users full data sovereignty and usher in Web 3.0 in a seamless way.  Mask has thus been building a bridge between Web 2.0 social networks and Web 3.0 DApps. We have built a robust decentralized infrastructure that allows almost any dapp to be integrated on top of existing social networks without resorting to their APIs. More than 20 Dapps have gone live on Mask network, including Uniswap, Sushi, Opensea, Snapshot, Arweave, Gitcoin donation, etc.\n\nYou can use all of them without ever leaving Twitter as long as you have the Mask Browser extension installed. Mask is even compatible with Metamask and can be used alongside. In fact Mask is even sharing a seat with MetaMask in one of the major standard-setting organizations for the internet, ECMA.\n\nRecently, we started the SocialFi Alliance(https://news.mask.io/2021/08/16/mask-network-launches-the-socialfi-alliance-with-15-founding-partners) with 7 DeFi apps in the alliance all live on Polygon. We will also expand it to Multi-chain and Multi-apps. We are also planning to start a Social NFT Alliance with even more features including NFT gallery, Verification for Twitter NFT avatar, NFT primary launch, NFT secondary marketplace, wrapping your social content into NFTs, NFT social games.We try to bring outstanding DeFi/NFT projects or anything Web3.0 of utilities to the Mask extension and to billions of social network users.\n\nWith the ecosystem growing, we feel the increasing need to further strengthen partnerships with additional financial incentives, and the opportunity to expand our funding method beyond bounties and corporate venture style investments.\n\n**We envision a future where Mask indeed helps billions of people access Web 3.0, and a very significant amount of valuable projects in the new world have a financial tie with Mask one way or another.** Think Tencent or Softbank. This needs both Mask core product to take off and a large war chest to form such ties.\n\nTherefore, to further expand mask ecosystem, to increase $MASK’s use, to facilitate governance, and to enhance MASK’s influence within the DeFi, NFT and Web3.0 spaces, we are introducing the Mask ecosystem fund for token swaps, a Venture Capital fund, and Mask Grant. This post will focus on the token swap fund.\n\n\n\n**The Mask ecosystem fund for token swaps**\n\nThe MaskDAO currently holds over 39% of the entire Mask token supply that is meant to be utilized to support and expand the MASK ecosystem. We believe an important way to do so is via strategic partnerships with crucial infrastructural protocols in the industry. We would like to pursue token swaps with our current/potential ecosystem partners as a way to accrue our utility of incentives to facilitate governance.\n\nWe propose a clear mandate allowing the DAO to pursue strategic swaps. Swaps may occur at par, a discount, or a premium, depending on additional factors involved with each deal. **Tokens swapped will be subject to mutual lockups of at least a 12-month linear vesting schedule.** \n\n**The size of the first fund for token swaps is set at 5 million $Mask, valued at roughly $50 million** (30-day TWAP at ~$10, 5% of total supply). We expect to support 30-80 listed projects over the next 2-3 years, as Mask total supply unlocks gradually to 100% (100mil Mask) as well. Follow-on capital allocation from MaskDAO will depend on the performance and net effect on ecosystem growth of the first fund.\n\nAll major decisions would be voted upon prior to finalization. Approval here allows DAO members to initiate conversations with other DAOs and entities and structure terms that should be agreeable both to the counterparty and the MASK community. In other words, this provides permission to speak on behalf of the DAO during the legwork of these proposals.\n\nFirst batch of potential partners could include 3 of our SocialFI Alliance partners: **Sushi, dHEDGE, and Gitcoin**.  \n\n**SushiSwap**\nThe SushiSwap community is building a comprehensive, decentralized trading platform for the future of finance. Sushi has long been the fan-favorite among the crypto community and has been a long-term partner of Mask. Mask has integrated Sushiswap on Ethereum mainnet, Polygon and BSC, will integrate Shoyu, the Sushi NFT platform at launch, and continue to add support for new Sushi endeavors.\n\n**dHEDGE**\ndHEDGE is a social trading Dapp where managers can operate a fund and followers can directly invest into the pool to enjoy the strategy. dHEDGE just launched its brand new V2 on Polygon. Social trading directly on major social networks is a huge upgrade over existing stand alone social trading sites.\n\n**Gitcoin**\nGitcoin is our Developer Community Partner, a community of builders, creators, and protocols at the center of open web ecosystems. Gitcoin is the easiest way to leverage the open source community to incentivize or monetize work. Mask is one of the largest bounty sponsors of Gitcoin with 44 bounties to date. Mask’s long term vision of a decentralized app ecosystem directly on top of social networks can’t be built without Gitcoin.\n\n**Other candidates also include  (but are not limited to):** \nLayer 1/2s: Polygon, Flow, Near, Solana, Avalanche, Fantom, Luna\nNFT: Axie Infinity, Ygg, Rarible, Superare, Agld\nWeb 3.0: The Graph, Arweave, Filecoin, BAT, Radicle, Kp3r, Epns\nDeFi: YFI, 0x, Rari Capital, Pooltogether, QuickSwap, AAVE, OlympusDAO, Perpetual. \n\nWe thank Polygon, Perpetual and Olympus for being the first few pioneers in the DAO token swap experiment. We also want to thank The Defiant for featuring us in the DAO token swap report.(https://thedefiant.io/defi-token-swaps-daos/)\n\nConcerns: DAO-owned $MASK would be introduced into the market. However, it would remain in the possession of those who are highly likely to remain long-term aligned with us.\n\n**Motion**\nFor: Approve DAO to pursue strategic swaps with a 5 million $Mask (~$50 million) first fund\n",

The ITO Review Committee conducts round 1 discussion about the project and its preliminary ITO proposal for 48-hours and conducts Committee vote #1. If the project passes the vote (more than 7 members voted in the Committee, with the approval rate higher than 50%), then Mask Network will launch a Snapshot vote for all community members.\n3. If the project does not pass Committee vote #1, then the project can make changes and adjustments to the proposal based on the ITO Review Committee's comments in the round 1 discussion, and provide a final ITO proposal within 24 hours for round 2 discussion. The Committee will conduct discussion #2 for 24-hour and vote. A Snapshot vote will be proposed if the proposal passes (to pass the vote, there should be more than 7 people voted in the Committee, with more than 50% of approval rate); if it still does not pass, then it fails the \"Community Choice ITO\" process.\n\nThe voting result from the $MASK community will decide whether these new rules apply to future ITO projects.\n\nThe Snapshot vote will last for 48 hours, all $MASK holders could vote \"Yes\" or \"No\" on the **improved Community Choice ITO process**.",

We thereby propose an update in the rule of the ITO Review Committee.\n\n**Proposal**\n\nWe propose that each round of the ITO Review Committee **will be composed of three parts: users by application, active Mask community members, and personnel from relevant organizations with professional backgrounds**. There will be 11 members per round, and each term is extended **from 15 days to 30 days**.\n1. Users by application. (People who meet any 1 of the following criteria can fill out the [application form](https://forms.gle/ceVUdhYmLL9yRLQ5A)\n- Users who hold at least 1000 $MASK.\n- Interacted with the Mask Network's contract at least twice, including ITO participation, red packet claims, NFT auctions, etc.\n- Posted at least 3 encrypted tweets using the Mask Network plug-in feature before May 30, 2021.\n2. Active Mask community members\n- Users who are active in Mask Network Telegram, WeChat Group, Discord, Mask Forum on a daily basis.\n- Users who offer constructive opinions about Mask Network.\n3. Personals in the field (blockchain, investment, research institutions, media, and relevant organizations, etc.) will be invited to the ITO Review Committee.\n- They have professional backgrounds in blockchain, investment, research, media, etc.\n- They will provide professional opinions, and review projects objectively.\n\nWhile still in the term, Committee members could withdraw from the Committee freely. Meanwhile, members of the committee who failed to fulfill the duty* could be disqualified from the Committee. Mask Network will add nominees if there are any vacancies.\n\n*\"Failed to fulfill the duty\" refers but is not limited to one of the following situations:\n- Never participate in the discussion or give feedbacks within the one project's application period\n- Neither vote nor called a clear abstention vote for more than 2 times during the voting period\n- Seeks personal gain as a member of the Committee\n- Other actions that compromise the collective benefit of the MaskDAO\n\nThe voting result from the $MASK community will decide whether these new rules apply to the future ITO Review Committee.\nThe Snapshot vote will last for 48 hours, all $MASK holders could vote \"Yes\" or \"No\" on the changes to the ITO Review Committee.",

Today, DAOSquare has grown into one of the most influential DAOS based out of China.\n \nDAOSquare has received seed funding from Youbi, SNZ, IOSG Ventures, GBV, MetaCartel Ventures China, Mask Network, and BR Capital.

      "content": "During our originally planned Round 1 of Lever’s ITO (on May 4th), we detected several groups of bots trying to front-run users and attack the ITO Round 1 for Lever. Mask Network team has successfully stopped their attempt. However, due to the decentralized nature of the ITO smart contract, we cannot retrieve the $LEV token locked inside the May 4th’s ITO contract. Additionally, we have postponed the ITO to May 5th due to the attack and saw a much greater chance for retail investors to make a successful purchase. Both the Lever team and Mask team feel strongly about a fair launch for all kinds of users. We actively build against any attempts to seek unfair advantages over the most ordinary ITO user. \n\nWith strong community demand, we can update certain parameters of the ITO smart contract to change the unlocking time for the May 4th’s Round, so that the bots will not be able to claim these $LEV token in the originally planned time. For the first time, community members are not passive bearers of attacks by scientists but can enjoy fair launch and have the power to enforce fair launch.\n\nWe hereby create a community voting proposal on this issue. The voting session will start at 16:00 (UTC), May. 5th, 2021, and lasts for 24 hours. The quorum is 200,000 $MASK (the vote is not valid until there are at least 200,000 votes). We will update the parameter according to the choice with the highest vote.\n\nProposal:\nHow should we change the unlock parameter about the unlocking time for May 4th’s $LEV token, attacked by bots and currently locked in the smart contract?\n\n1: Increase it to 1 month (30 days)\n2: Increase it to 3 years (1095 days)\n3: Increase it to 2^48 seconds, the longest time we can lock it (8,919,594.29 years)\n\n",

On the one hand, lending and trading are relatively isolated in DeFi, as users cannot take out loans and directly trade within a single lending protocol or decentralized exchange. On the other hand, margin trading as a trillion-dollar market in the crypto world is absent from DeFi — i.e., users can hardly long an asset on any DEX. \n\nLever Network is the first AMM-based decentralized margin trading platform. With the mission to establish a safe and easy-to-use decentralized financial product matrix, Lever Network combined the deposit margin vault with DEX perfectly in an innovative way, which solved the trading needs of users who could not increase leverage to go long or short in the DeFi world.\n\nLever Network has completed a seed round of $600,000, led by NGC Ventures, ArkStream, LD Capital, AU21, with other organizations like DAOMaker, YBB, and DFG involved.\n\nWebsite：https://www.lever.network/\n\nLever ITO plan\n\n1st Round\nAmount: 40,000 USDT\nMax buying amount for single address: 400 USDT\nTokens available to swap: USDC\nToken holding requirement:\nParticipant need to hold more than 100 $MASK to participate in ITO\n\n\n2nd Round\nAmount: 60,000 USDT\nMax buying amount for single address: 300 USDT\nTokens available to swap: USDC\nNo whitelist requirement\n",

Individuals and projects could choose to launch a permissionless or a community choice ITO. To help people make better use of ITO, Mask Network introduced a community voting mechanism and formed ITO Review Committee (learn more  https://news.mask.io/zh-Hans/2021/04/22/ito-is-upgraded-who-is-the-next ), to benefit the growth of the Mask Network ecosystem with the help of the community.\n\nWe opened up applications for the ITO Review Committee and ITO Projects on April 22nd. On April 27th, 11 $MASK holders were selected out of more than 40 applicants and formed the first ITO Review Committee.\n\nEvanesco Network is the first project that applied for ITO since we introduced the community voting mechanism. After a thorough examination and sufficient communication with the project, the decision to pass the preliminary review was made carefully by the Committee.\n\nNow we will begin the third step of a community choice ITO ---- $MASK Voting\n\nThe Snapshot vote will last for 36 hours, all $MASK holders could vote “Yes” or “No” on this ITO.
