      "title": "[AIP-30] New Product Proposal - Stablecoin",
      "content": "# Voting\n\nThis AIP will be a simple YES or NO voting\n\n- A Yes vote would approve the proposal and grant the team access to the fund to start this development\n- A No vote would require us to go back and come up with a new product proposal\n\nIf a yes vote is passed, \n- The team will work on a more detailed development timeline\n- Progress update will be share with the community on a monthly basis (and more frequent towards the launch)\n\n## Product Overview\n\nWe propose to create a decentralized stablecoin product on [Stacks](https://www.stacks.co/). Its main feature will be to allow users to use Bitcoin on Stacks as collateral to mint stablecoin. Key value propositions for our stablecoin will be:\n- 1.) Capital Efficiency\n- 2.) Interest-free (i.e., no borrowing interest)\n- 3.) Robust pegging mechanism.\n(Some information are omitted due to characters limit. Please refer to the forum post for full details:  https://forum.alpacafinance.org/t/aip-30-new-product-proposal/883/1)\n\n## Product Details\n\nUsers will be able to deposit Bitcoin as collateral to take out a loan (i.e., mint stablecoin), interest-free. The stablecoin is backed by users’ deposited collateral, stability pool, and the collective borrowers as last resort. \n\n**Interest-Free Borrowing**\n\nWe will charge a **one-time loan origination fee** to users when they borrow stablecoin. Only paying a one-time loan origination fee is one of the killer features in our opinion as borrowers are not susceptible to interest rate risk during the lifetime of the loan. \n\nThis is especially true during a bull market where the demand for leverage goes up significantly and there could be periods where the borrowing interest rate spikes or remains stubbornly high for a period of time.\n\n**How is peg achieved?**\n\n***The issue with the original AUSD:***\n\nAUSD's lack of adoption was mainly due to its ability to hold the $1 peg. While the AUSD system was safe (i.e., overcollateralized and fully backed at all time), it couldn’t hold peg because there was no robust direct redemption framework available.\n\nWhile we had a stable swap module in place, it required a stablecoin treasury to be built up first (i.e., someone needs to first mint AUSD via a stable swap module) before it can be used for redemption (AUSD -> BUSD.) In this scenario, arbitrageurs were reluctant to step in and buy AUSD when it was < $1, because they did not know how long they had to hold onto AUSD before it returned to peg.\n\nA way to solve this problem is to allow for a direct redemption of the stablecoin for an underlying asset. One way this can be achieved is by building up a treasury to be used for direct redemption. One example of this would be [FEI](https://fei.money/) where they raised a massive amount of treasury to allow for a direct redemption from FEI -> USD. However, building up a large enough treasury is no easy feat, and has only been achieved through a fund raise in conjunction with token sales.\n\n***How will we keep the new stablecoin's peg?***\n\nWe propose a way for direct redemption via the **ability to close out debt positions by anyone.** Specifically, anyone who holds our stablecoin (not just the debt position owner) will be able to redeem it at $1 worth of collateral, net of fee. This means an arbitrageur can step in anytime the **stablecoin price < $1 - fee, and would keep our stablecoin hard pegged to that price.**\n\nIn order to determine which positions will be (partially) closed out when the redemptions occur, our smart contract will sort all existing positions by their risk level (collateralized ratio) and close the positions with the highest risks first. This method also has the benefits of reducing the overall risk level of the protocol.\n\nFor debt holders, if their positions are closed, they will forfeit the value of their collateral equivalent to the amount of stablecoins redeemed against their positions. In exchange, they do not have to return the stablecoins. Debt position owners can lower the risks by either partially paying back the debt or adding additional collateral to their positions to prevent it from being redeemed againsts.\n\nConversely, if the price of stablecoin is > $1, an arbitrager can deposit collateral, mint stablecoin, and sell in the open market.\n\n***How does Stability Pool work?***\n\nAssets in the stability pool are used to pay back debt for liquidated positions. When a liquidation happens, stablecoin in the stability pool is used to close the debt position (i.e., burn) and the position’s collateral is transferred to the stability pool. Over time, the collateral assets (e.g., BTC) in the stability pool will grow and stableoin will decrease, as liquidations happen.\n\nInstead of requiring technical sophisticated liquidators in the past, this model will allow users of all technical levels to participate and support the protocol by becoming a liquidator. Stability pool depositors will earn a liquidation fee which is the source of yields.\n\n## Resources and Timeline\n\n* We estimate that the development effort will take ~3 months to complete and we are requesting a budget of $150k USD, which will be funded from the collected fees from BUSD conversion (AIP-29). A more detailed timeline and development plan will be provided if this initiative gains support from the community.\n\n* If actual spend is less than the allocated amount, the remaining budget will be released back to be used for other initiatives as decided by the Governance process.\n\n* We will need additional budget for launch incentives & marketing at the time of launch, which could come from a combination of Warchest and other sources.",

      "title": "[AIP-28] Updating Governance Voting Structure",
      "content": "# Background:\n\nThe Alpaca team is always looking for ways to improve our Governance process.  A useful framework / concept we don’t currently have for Alpaca’s Governance voting is Quorum and the ability for users to vote abstain. Quorum refers to the minimum % of voters turn out required for the voting result to be valid.\n\n# Implementation:\n\n* All the future votes would have a quorum requirement. If the votes don’t meet the quorum requirement, then the result is not valid and would require new voting.\n\n* “Abstain” voting option will be added , so xALPACA holders can still contribute to the quorum on a topic that they don’t have a strong opinion or preference.\n\n### Quorum Requirement:\n\n1.) Minimum of **10% of xALPACA voted** in order for the result to be valid. (rounded to the nearest 100,000s) For example, if the total xALPACA balance was 47million, we would require 4.7 million votes.\n\n> **Note:** When it is used, the Quorum required in DeFi projects are around 10% - 20% of eligible voters. For the case of Alpaca, since there is around 23 million xALPACA, around 2.0 - 4.5 million xALPACA votes would be required on a proposal to meet the quorum (based on the old Governance vault's stats.) A quick review of previous proposals on Snapshot would show that all the previous ones would have met the quorum requirement. This is a good sign and show that we have an active community as compared to our peers in the industry.\n\n### New Voting Structure:\n\n1.) At least 72 hours of voting time for each proposal.\n\n2.) Shielded voting for all proposals\n\n3.) All voting choices shall be put on equal footing. For example, if the proposal is on changing a protocol’s parameter and there are multiple possible parameter values to select from, we will conduct a series of votes with the first vote being a YES or NO on whether to change the parameter.\n\n4.) There will be an option for users to vote Abstain. This way, xALPACA holders can still contribute to the quorum on a topic that they don’t have a strong opinion or preference.\n\n5.) For a “simple voting” topics where there are only two choices (i.e., YES or NO), the YES vote just need to be greater than the NO vote for the proposal to pass. There is no need for YES vote to be > 50%\n\n6.) In the case where the number of voting choices > 2, we WILL NOT require the winning result to receive > 50% of the votes, unless specified prior to the vote. The rationale behind this is to save time / energy from too many votes. More over, if the voting structured is well thought out (as in point#3 above) the multiple choices (>2) would be the final vote in a series of votes.\n\n# Voting:\n\nThis AIP will be a single-choice voting,\n\n- A YES vote would implement the new voting structure as proposed in this AIP\n- A NO vote would keep the voting structure the same",

      "content": "# Background\n\nWith the upcoming change to the Government Vault (AIP-24), there could be an impact on behavior of stakers with the new locking / unlocking mechanism. We want to make the community aware of these potential dynamics and decide whether to make any adjustment to the insurance plan.\n\n# Rationale\n\nThe Alpaca Insurance plan funds the coverage through the portion of the protocol revenue that would go to the Governance Vault stakers. As it would currently work, if there is a large amount on the insurance plan to be paid, the first order effect would likely be for some users to unlock and sell ALPACA due to the anticipated lower yields.\n\nPlease note that this is different from the old format because with the new Governance Vault staking format, users only require 21 days to unlock.\n\nThe above effect will continue until the new equilibrium is reached, which would likely be a lower staked APR% and selling pressure on ALPACA from people who exited their positions.\n\n# Execution\n\nWe list below potential approaches we can take as a basis to kick-start the community discussion\n\n### **Keep the plan as is**\n\n* Leave the plan as is and let the market force plays out if insurance plan is activated\n\n### **Establish an active insurance fund**\n\n* Instead of paying the cover through future revenue, establish an active reserve to pay out in the event where insurance is activated\n* Note that for this option to work, we would need to build up the reserve and might require some adjustment in how the current protocol revenue is distributed - e.g. redirect a portion of the burn to build up reserve\n\n### Reduce a cap on the max amount and/or duration we would payout\n\n* The current Insurance Plan would pay out up to 1 year.\n* This option would reduce the duration of the payout and/or put a cap on the max amount to be paid out for a given incident\n\n### Increase the penalty / time for withdrawal if the insurance plan kicks in.\n\n* Might not fully solve the problem as people can still front run prior to the finalization of the Governance vote to activate insurance plan\n\n### Abolish the Plan\n\n* Eliminate the insurance plan entirely, and let users purchase their own cover as offered by 3rd party protocols\n\n# Voting\nThis AIP will be a single choice voting\n\n- **Option1:** Keep the plan as is\n- **Option2:** Establish an active insurance fund\n- **Option3:** Reduce a cap on the max amount and/or duration we would payout\n- **Option4:** Increase the penalty / time for withdrawal if the insurance plan kicks in.\n- **Option5:** Abolish the Plan\n\n**Note:** \n- There will be no run-off voting for this AIP, any option receiving the highest % of votes will be considered a winning choice (i.e., can be less than 50% of the total votes)\n- If option2, 3, or 4 becomes a winner, there will need to be subsequent discussion and voting to specify the relevant parameters for the winning option.",

      "title": "[AIP-26] Transitioning the Governance Vault",
      "content": "## Background & Rationale:\n\nAs currently written in the AIP-24, all locked governance stakers are set to automatically unlock during the upcoming governance migration. Users will then have to manually lock their tokens in the new governance vault. This setup could be breaking the “lock momentum” and forcing stakers to manually lock in the new governance may lead to a non-trivial amount of ALPACA not relocking, and subsequent selling pressure on ALPACA. So we’re proposing for locked tokens from old governance to remain locked in new governance (users will be able to withdraw after 21 days, which is the new max lock period should they unlock)\n\n## Execution:\n\nAutomatically migrate locked xALPACA in the old Governance vault to continue as locked in the new gov vault. This way, locked tokens will remain locked, and maintain the momentum of being opt-in.\n\nIf users wish to unlock, they can then do so on the new Governance Vault. So for many users who do not need to unlock urgently, they’re more likely to keep their tokens locked, because it will be the default.\n\n---\n\n***Note:**\n\n* xALPACA that’s already unlocked in the old Governance vault at the time of migration will not be moved to the new vault. Users will be able to claim them directly in the old vault*\n* The new Governance vault is scheduled to go live around mid November.\n\n## Voting:\nThis AIP will be a single-choice voting\n\n- A YES vote would implement the transition of the locked ALPACA into the new Governance vault as described\n\n- A NO vote would NOT transition the locked ALPACA to the new vault, meaning users will have to do it manually.",

      "title": "[AIP-25] Migration from AF1.0 -> AF2.0",
      "content": "# Background\n\nSince the launches of Concentrated Liquidity (CL) for major DEXs on the BNB chain and the shift in farming rewards to the new CL pools, the yields and liquidity on the old UNIv2-type pools steadily declined over time, which caused the profitability of our LYF farms to also decrease.\n\nWith AF2.0 money market now operating in a stable manner and AVv3 operations getting ready to scale, it makes sense that we migrate lending assets in AF1.0 over.\n\nWith the migration of the lending assets from AF1.0 -> AF2.0, AUSD will also be affected as the AF1.0’s ibTokens are used as collateral for AUSD.\n\n# Rationale\n\nWe believe the migration to AF2.0 will have the following benefits:\n\n* Overtime, the yield and liquidity will continue to go down on the old pools, and some ofthem will reach an unsafe level and have higher risk of bad debt due to low liquidity.\n* By migrating over to AF2.0, we would lower maintenance costs and efforts so devs will have more time to focus on AF2.0 related tasks.\n* Increasing lending liquidity for AF2.0 will help support scaling for AVv3.\n\n# Implementation\n\nThe migration will be done in phases, starting from first sunsetting AUSD and then migrating lending pools, starting from low utilization assets.\n\nThe high-level timeline is shown in the figure below:\n\n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreidollben44qjlngeawje33qfzspixpfekhuxjkbky7c36rv3d4624)\n    \n\n## Sunsetting AUSD\n\nTo sunset AUSD, we will do the following:\n\n**Step0: Notice period**\n\n* There will be a notice period of ~ 2 weeks for users with AUSD positions to close them out.\n* Users will be able to do this via two methods\n  * Buy AUSD from an open market on Ellipsis and return the debt (market price, limited liquidity)\n  * Use our stable swap module to return the AUSD debt (Always at $1, unlimited liquidity)\n\n**Step1: Force Close Position**\n\n* Any remaining AUSD positions will be forced close.\n* Force Closing will work in the following way:\n  * User’s collateral is sold via stable swap (BUSD and USDT will be converted 1:1, while BNB collateral will first be sold into a stable coin and then converted 1:1 via the stable swap module)\n  * Any remaining collateral will be returned to users\n\n## Migrating Lending Pools\n\nTimeline is tentative based on how fast we past this proposal\n\n### Batch #1: Start immediately after AUSD sunsetting\n\n* BTCB\n* ETH\n* USDC\n\nTotal Batch #1 farming TVL: **~$411k USD**\n\nThese assets have very low utilization and few profitable farming opportunities on AF1.0 Moreover, we have BTCB and ETH savings vaults on AF2.0 which will generate borrowing demand for these assets. Thus, they make for perfect candidates to migrate over right away.\n\n### Batch #2: ~ End of October / Early November\n\n* BNB\n* USDT\n* CAKE\n\nTotal Batch #2 farming TVL: ~**$16.5Mn USD**\n\nYou can see all the active farming positions in batch#2 here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1K7Dgjaui0Mc_D4gsvjN_9oeoN8pXz4FgoRgLyrGR18M/edit#gid=0\n\n- Majority of the positions are in major pairs: USDT-WBNB, BTCB-USDT, ETH-USDT\n- Avg. Leverage borrowing BNB ~ 2.2x\n- Avg. Leverage borrowing USDT ~3.3x\n\nFor batch#2, these assets still have usages on AF1.0 and there are still people farming these pools profitably, so for these assets, we have two options to proceed:\n\n**Option1:** Keep them as is to allow users to continue farming on UNIv2\n\n- For this option, we will not migrate the batch2 farms now but will do it in the future when\n   - Liquidity in the underlying pools drops to an unsafe level\n   - Lower yields resulting in user naturally exit these positions\n   - The team also reserve the rights to adjust the leverage and liquidation thresholds for these remaining pools down to reduce the risks to lenders\n\n**Option2: Migrate them now**\n- This option would migrate batch#2 over to AF2.0\n\n### Batch #3: By the end of November\n\n* BUSD\n* ALPACA\n\nTotal Batch #3 farming TVL: **~$10.5Mn USD**\n\nGiven that BUSD is being sunsetted by Binance, we will not be migrating it over to the AF2.0. However, we will just close down the remaining farming positions related to BUSD.\n\nSimilarly, ALPACA will not be migrated to AF2.0 unless we add an ALPACA farm there.\n\nFor each batch, we will implement the following steps to migrate.\n\n**Step0: Notice Period**\n- there will be a notice period (~1 week) before we start executing each batch, where users can close their positions and withdraw their lending assets. After that, we will start implementing the steps below:\n\n**Step1: Disable opening new positions on the relevant farms**\n\n* Relevant farms refer to farms that contain the migration assets in the pair.For batch #1, any farms that borrows BTCB, ETH, and USDC in the pairs will be closed.\n* For example, a BTCB-BNB farm, any positions farming this pool that borrows BTCB will be closed during batch one migration. BTCB-BNB farming positions borrowing BNB will be closed during the Batch 2 migration.\n* For a full list of the farming pairs to be included in each batch, you can visit here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_SRmiXkjZdjFnVg3nBVTkihEDny_ePP1lN3dIGgIvHs/edit#gid=1262310802\n\n**Step2: Close any remaining LYF positions**\n\n* Any remaining positions on the relevant farms will be closed\n* Debts will be repaid to the lending pools\n* Any remaining values will be returned to the farmers wallet addresses\n\n**Step3: Move lending assets over to AF2.0**\n\n* After all the LYF farm are closed, all assets will be migrated and deposited into their respected lending pools on AF2.0\n\n**Step4: Claim ibToken**\n\n* Users whose assets were migrated will be able to claim their ibToken for AF2.0, the assets will then be deposited into their subaccount.\n* Please note that users will start earning lending interest on AF2.0 right away, and can claim their ibToken anytime. Claiming ibToken will allow users to be able to withdraw their assets from AF2.0\n\n# Voting\n\nThis AIP will be a single choice voting with two voting options:\n\n**Option1:** Execute migration plan for batch #1 and batch #3 only.\n- For this option, we will not migrate the batch2 farms (~$16.5Mn) now but will do it in the future when:\n   - Liquidity in the underlying pools drops to an unsafe level\n   - Lower yields resulting in user naturally exit these positions\n- The team also reserve the rights to adjust the leverage and liquidation thresholds for these remaining pools down to reduce the risks to lenders\n\n**Option2:** Execute migration plan for all batches",

      "content": "# Background\n\nTUSD is relaunching a native token (instead of a Binance issued) on BNB Chain. The old TUSD token (currently on AF1.0) will be deprecated, with Binance planning to auto convert all TUSD deposited on the exchange for users.\n\nSource: https://www.binance.com/en/feed/post/411793\n\n\n# Rationale\n\n- Even though TUSD is a top-tier, safe stablecoin, if the liquidity in the pool gets too low relative to the position size, there is still a risk of liquidation from price impact when swapping to pay back debt.\n\n- TUSD borrowing amount is already low (< $100k USD), so discontinuing support TUSD will have small impact on the protocol revenue.\n\n- This is only impacting AF1.0. We will plan to support the new TUSD on AF2.0.\n\n# Implementation:\n\nWe will follow the same implementation structure for when we sunset WaultSwap ([Ref.](/governance/aip-details/aip-4.2-solution-to-eliminate-bad-debt-risks-from-remaining-waultswap-positions))\n\n1. We will upgrade the TUSD farming contracts to allow for a privileged address (i.e., dev controlled address) to liquidate any TUSD’s farming positions\n\n2. Given there are still TUSD liquidity left on DEXs, we will swap TUSD to base asset as required to pay back debt. However, if at the time of execution, there isn't enough TUSD liquidity, we will change the liquidation method. Instead of swapping non-borrowed token in the DEX (this is the cause of bad debt or large slippage due to low liquidity), we will use oracle price and let the new liquidation strategy deduct the necessary amount from our wallet as determined by the Oracle.\n\n3. Farming positions will now have all base assets and be able to pay back debt and close the positions\n\n4. Any remaining value after debt repayment is sent back to users\n\n# Voting:\n\nThis AIP will be a single choice voting.\n\n- A YES vote would sunset the LYF for TUSD on AF1.0\n\n- A NO vote would leave the TUSD farms as is",

The rewards programs, in and of themselves, are the biggest marketing efforts, but below includes some of the additional marketing we did:\n\n- PR Articles\n- AMAs:\n-- BNB Chain\n-- Open Ocean\n-- Space ID\n-- Moonaco Podcast\n-- Hacken\n\nWhile these channels have helped promote us for free given the past relationships and the reputation of Alpaca Finance, many high-quality marketing channels are exclusively paid channels. With that in mind, we seek to expand our marketing efforts to take advantage of these paid channels.\n\n# Implementation:\n\nWe are proposing a budget of **175,000 ALPACA (~$35K USD)** to help with marketing of the two new products. We propose that the budget is funded from the unused Feb’s emissions. The amount proposed is ~50% of the Feb’s emissions.\n\nThe budget will be used for paid marketing channels which include:\n\n- Group/KOL AMAs\n- Trading Groups\n- Paid tweets from KOLs\nWe will only use the budget as required and on channels we believe provide the best return on the $ spent. Feel free to give your thoughts and opinions below.\n\n# Voting:\nThis AIP will be a single choice voting.\n\n- A YES vote would create the marketing budget from Feb emissions.\n\n- A NO vote would not create a budget.\nWe think the amount is sufficient for now, and since it is a relatively small amount, we also think voting about decreasing it isn’t worthwhile either.",

Please note that we already do this to some extent for AF2.0 where 6% (of the 19%) of the lending performance fees goes to Gov vault. We could apply the same structure on AF1.0 as well. Given there is no new ALPACA emission, the token will always be in deflationary and reducing the burn portion slightly wouldn’t have a big impact.\n\n# Implementation\nIf passed, the new lending performance fees of AF1.0 would be changed to:\n\n6% to Governance Vault\n4% to Buyback and Burn\n\nPlease note that the structure above is the current structure for AF2.0, while currently 10% of the lending performance of AF1.0 goes to buyback and burn.\n\n# Voting\nThis AIP will be a single choice voting.\n\n- A YES vote would change the AF1.0’s fee structure to align with AF2.0\n- A NO vote would leave the lending performance fee of AF1.0 as is.",

We will upgrade the MDEX farming contract to allow for a privileged address (i.e., dev controlled address) to liquidate any MDEX’s positions (only for MDEX. No change to PCS or Biswap positions.)\n2. We will change the liquidation method. Instead of swapping non-borrowed token in the DEX (this is the cause of bad debt or large slippage due to low liquidity), we will use oracle price and let the new liquidation strategy deduct the necessary amount from our wallet as determined by the Oracle with a 5% discount.\n3. Farming positions will now have all base assets and be able to pay back debt and close the positions\n4. Any remaining value after debt repayment is sent back to users\n\nIn Step #2, Alpaca Core team will provide the liquidity required to close the positions. We will then manually swap them in CEX or other DEX to get back stablecoin. If there is any profit after, we will use them to buyback ALPACA and burn.\n\n# Voting\n\nThis AIP will be a single-choice voting. There will be two voting options:\n\n1.

ALPACA were to come from various sources\n\n### February Emission:\n\n* Per [AIP-15.5](https://docs.alpacafinance.org/governance/aip-details/aip-15.5-sources-for-incentives-incentives-for-new-upcoming-products-perp-af2.0), the community has also voted to use February emission as part of the incentives rewards. In total, 350,381.7 ALPACA was collected. ([TX Proof](https://bscscan.com/tx/0x4035e5c481f112639c8be41e2274afa0f3b30ce86fd4313e0fa1d88df49cde21))\n\n### Unclaimed ITAM rewards:\n\n* Per [AIP-1](https://docs.alpacafinance.org/governance/aip-details/aip-1-handling-of-itam-rewards), the last day to claim ITAM rewards was 15 March 2023. In total, there was 1,542,758 unclaimed ALPACA ([TX Proof](https://bscscan.com/tx/0x29e0a9050293e3bf65789046edae7642135f61b0e5e4051e7459632ad14f0547))\n\nThe whole balance from the two sources above (1,893,140 ALPACA) are now collected in these wallet addresses: \n\n*Feb Emission: [0xaba4d5a2ab5486446d0e7c7f34c3c19e2564b3c5](https://bscscan.com/address/0xaba4d5a2ab5486446d0e7c7f34c3c19e2564b3c5)\n\n*ITAM: [0x09d25b4e72132183eb05d6c4da2b7533e178a0ae](https://bscscan.com/address/0x09d25b4e72132183eb05d6c4da2b7533e178a0ae).\n\n### Liquidation Treasury:\n\n* Currently, we have 305k ALPACA + $2.7k USD in other assets in the liquidation treasury.

([Address](https://bscscan.com/address/0x2bfdacF6CdBC3ECcb95E68ec448ECf3d0693F732))\n\nBased on the info above, we have more than required ALPACA for AIP-15 from the liquidation treasury, early withdrawal fee, and Unclaimed ITAM rewards. Extra ALPACA (~370k ALPACA) from these three sources will go towards weekly burns over time.\n\nThis means the entire amount (350k ALPACA) from February will not be needed for Perp and AF2.0  incentives. And as stated in AIP15.5, the community will get to decide what to do with this portion of ALPACA.\n\n# Voting\n\nThis AIP will be a single-choice voting. There will be two voting options:\n\n1. **Burn** - The entire Feb emission amount will be burned.\n\n2. **Reserve for future initiatives / product launches** - $ALPACA will be kept in a multi-sig wallet, and deployed in the lending vault. The community will then decide again in a future proposal how to use these as incentives.",

      "title": "[AIP-16] Adjusting Slope3 max interest rate ",
      "content": "## Background:\n\nWith the success of AVs repurchasing rollout, we have seen a strong demand in AVs which pushed up the borrowing utilization rate to 70%-90% for stable coins (BUSD and USDT.) Our [[AIP-10] Further optimizing the borrowing interest rate slope](https://docs.alpacafinance.org/governance/aip-details/aip-10-further-optimizing-the-borrowing-interest-rate-slope) proved to be a success. During the increase in utilization, farmers continued to enjoy stability in borrowing rates and farmed profitably while lenders also saw an increase in their lending interest.\n\nHowever, recently, we have seen a brief period where USDT’s utilization > 90%. In this discussion we would like to propose adjusting the max. slope3 value down from **150% → 40%**\n\n## Rationale:\n\nCurrently the max borrowing rate in the slope3 region is set at 150% APR. This value makes for a very steep slope in the 90%-100% utilization range. A utilization just slightly above 90% would make farming unprofitable -e.g., 92% utilization = 36% borrowing interest. This model has two potential issues\n\n* It can scare new users who do not understand the model well when they see negative APR on the Farm and AV pages\n* It could allow for some players to manipulate the rate around the 90% utilization range with relatively small capital.\n\nAlso, in reality, any borrowing APR% above 20% will already make all the major LYF pools unprofitable, which means a max slope3 rate much lower than the current 150% could achieve the same effect of 1.) attracting more liquidity to the lending pools and 2.) incentivizing users to close their positions, but in a more gradual manner.\n\n## Implementation:\n\n* We propose reducing the max borrowing rate in the slope3 region to **40% APR for all lending vaults. (except $CAKE)**\n* Borrowing interest for slope1 and slope2 regions will be left unchanged.\n\nExample adjustment for BNB borrowing rate:\n\n|Utilization|New Interest Rate|Current Interest Rate|\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|90.0%|8.00%|8.00%|\n|91.0%|11.20%|22.20%|\n|92.0%|14.40%|36.40%|\n|93.0%|17.60%|50.60%|\n|94.0%|20.80%|64.80%|\n|95.0%|24.00%|79.00%|\n|96.0%|27.20%|93.20%|\n|97.0%|30.40%|107.40%|\n|98.0%|33.60%|121.60%|\n|99.0%|36.80%|135.80%|\n|100.0%|40.00%|150.00%| \n![0052763f2bc4f5ec91d6273e0bc42b77ef346797.png](ipfs://bafkreigny3jbpb7o6qfslsxgs6tjotvfonuxmpcz2dniiih6n7g26exdpe)\n    \n\n## Voting:\n\nWe will do a simple YES or NO vote for this AIP\n- A YES vote would adjust the max slope3 interest rate down to 40%\n- A NO vote would leave the interest rate as is.",

See [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/129BnAicM2uUWvr2TSkABUbw1jLam3URC9RNWrzL1HnU/edit#gid=1037198875).\n\nHowever, there is a chance that some of the ITAM rewards will be claimed before the deadline (15th March), dropping the ALPACA amount below what is required. Thus, this vote will focus on the secondary sources, as contingencies, in case there is a shortfall.\n\nThe options are:\n\n- **February emission** - Since we will not know if there will be a shortfall until mid March, if the community decides to pause February emission (~240k ALPACA), we will stop the emission in February, and reserve them for incentives. If they are not required, the community can later decides what to do with the amount - e.g., resume emission, burn, reserve as incentives for future products, etc.\n\n- **Buyback and burn** - We would only pause the burn in March if there is a shortfall\n\n- **Governance Vault** - We would only redirect a portion of the Governance Vault’s distribution in March if there is a shortfall\n\n- **Warchest** - Will only mint warchest if the above three sources are not enough to cover the amount required\n\n## Voting\nWe will use the “Approval” voting system for this AIP. Please read the details below carefully since this system is different from the single choice voting we typically do.\n\n- **Option1:** February Emission\n- **Option2:** Buyback and Burn\n- **Option3:** Governance Vault Distribution\n- **Option4:** Warchest\n\nYou may select (\"approve\") any number of choices, other choices that you **DO NOT** select are automatically considered as **NOT** approved. \n\n### Example:\n- Alice selects to approve February emission and Buyback and Burn in her vote. This means she approves these two options and automatically disapprove the use of Governance Vault Distribution and Warchest\n\nChoices with greater than 50% approval votes will be used as funding sources, but **ONLY** in the case there is a shortfall. Choices with less than 50% approval votes will **NOT** be used as funding sources.\n",

You can see the analysis [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/129BnAicM2uUWvr2TSkABUbw1jLam3URC9RNWrzL1HnU/edit?usp=sharing).\n\n#### Traders:\n\nALPACA will be used as incentives for traders through:\n\n#### Rewards for trading competition ($50k)\n\n- We plan to run two trading competitions with $25,000 prize pool per competition\n\n#### 0-fee trading ($0)\n\n- Users will be able to open and close positions for free or a relatively nominal fee. We may implement this through rebates. There will still be borrowing interest while positions are kept open.\n- This is technically $0 cost required up-front. The cost is to missed revenue during this period, but this should be an effective promotional campaign to get traders to at least try the new product.\n\nTotal rewards required for Perp launch is: **$225k - $350k**\n\n## VOTING\n\nThe vote will be a single choice where you can choose the $ amount to allocate for Perp’s incentives. \n\nOption1:  850,000 ALPACA (~$225k)\nOption2: 1,000,000 ALPACA (~$275k)\nOption3:  1,200,000 ALPACA (~$325k)\nOption4:  1,300,000 ALPACA (~$350k)",

This has similar functionality to xALPACA but adds an additional vesting layer with the key properties below:\n\n* esALPACA cannot be transferred or sold\n* esALPACA can be staked for yields in its own staking vault\n  * Governance Vault stakers will vote on the percentage of the platform revenue to allocate for esALPACA staking vault\n  * At the end of the 3-months period, based on the figure presented above, there will roughly be 2Mn - 4Mn esALPACA (vs. 37Mn xALPACA currently) This means, for example, that if we allocate 5% of the Governance Vault’s revenue to esALPACA staking vault, they would receive a comparable APR% to Governance’s vault stakers\n* esALPACA will have voting power\n  * It can be 1esALPACA = 1 vote = 1 xALPACA, or voting power for esALPACA can be lower\n* esALPACA can be turned into ALPACA by going through a vesting period (e.g., 6-12 months.). While vesting, user will not earn any rewards\n\n**Estimated development time:** 4 - 6 weeks\n\n**Pros:**\n\n* Strong incentives to hold esALPACA as stakers will earn yields (as long as a reasonable percentage of revenue is allocated to the staking vault) and have voting power. This aspect is similar to xALPACA\n* Strong incentive to not vest esALPACA as users won’t earn yields during the entire vesting period\n* No immediate selling pressure or dilution of ALPACA\n* Unlike other mechanics where ALPACA tokens must be available for claim right away, this mechanic allows for a “fund-as-you-go” setup because ALPACA is only available to claim 1 year after vesting\n\n**Cons:**\n\n* Requires significant development effort. In our opinion, while the effort would make sense if we were updating the entire tokenomics with a 10-year emissions schedule, in this context where the incentives might only be used for several months, the development effort is too high\n* Also requires an external audit ($10k - $15k)\n* Two separate staking vaults and two voting tokens will make our protocol more complicated for users, especially less experienced ones\n\n# VOTING\n\nThis vote will be a single choice voting where you can choose between the 4 options:\n\n- Option1: Distribute as ALPACA\n- Option2: Distribute as ALPACA with vesting\n- Option3: Distribute as xALPACA\n- Option4: Distribute as esALPACA",

      "content": "# Background:\nIn response to the feedback we received from the community in the original forum post, [Adjustment to ALPACA tokenomics to support the upcoming (Perp, AF2.0) and future product launches](https://forum.alpacafinance.org/t/for-discussion-potential-adjustment-to-alpaca-tokenomics-to-support-upcoming-perp-af2-0-and-future-product-launches/618), the team went back to refine the proposal so as to **NOT** make any changes to the ALPACA tokenomics. Options 1-3 from that post will no longer be considered.\n\nThe below discussion thread will instead focus on potential alternative sources of funds we can use to incentivize the launch of Perp and AF2.0, and the mechanics of distribution. First, we’ll summarize the goal of such incentives:\n\n# Goal:\nBy providing incentives, we can increase the chance of returning, existing, and new users to use the new Alpaca products. Many of these users are already using other platforms for these use cases, such as perps and overcollateralized lending. As such, these users have **switching costs** of leaving their current platforms, which become a hurdle when they consider embracing a new service provider (such costs can include bridging, knowledge accumulation, gas, token swaps, security analysis, increased uncertainty of using a new platform, etc.). Their perceived benefits of our new products need to be higher than the switching costs for new users to use our products, and early incentives can significantly help push perceived benefits higher, thus crossing the obstacle of switching costs.\n\nWith successfully implemented incentives, the ultimate goal is to have additional revenue outpace the cost of the incentives, and for that revenue to continue growing over time. In the mid to long-term, superior product design will maintain high retention, and the new users will re-establish new switching costs for Alpaca, where switching costs will change from a negative to a positive for us; in other words, instead of costs to switch to Alpaca, these users will have costs to switch from Alpaca, which will become our strategic advantage, and a hurdle for our competitors.\n\n# Proposal\nWe break down the discussion into 3 sections, which should form a basis for discussion and future votings:\n\n* How many ALPACA are required?\n* Where would the ALPACA come from?\n* What is the mechanic to distribute these ALPACA rewards?\n\n## How many ALPACA are required?\n\n### Perp\n\nWe would like to incentivize Perp to two main user groups: liquidity providers and traders.\n\n#### Liquidity Providers:\n\nALPACA will be used to supplement yields from other fee sources earned by the liquidity providers (borrowing fees, position opening, closing fees, swap fees, etc.), because those fees will take some time to ramp up to a steady level as traders are onboarded to the platform.\n\n- **Target liquidity pool’s TVL:** $10 - $15Mn\n- **Target APR% (from ALPACA yields only):** 10.5-12% - based on the current yields of comparable pools in the market\n- **Incentivization period:** 2 months\n\nBased on the parameters above, we will require roughly **~$175 - 300k** in rewards for liquidity providers. You can see the analysis [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/129BnAicM2uUWvr2TSkABUbw1jLam3URC9RNWrzL1HnU/edit?usp=sharing).\n\n#### Traders:\n\nALPACA will be used as incentives for traders through:\n\n#### Rewards for trading competition ($50k)\n\n- We plan to run two trading competitions with $25,000 prize pool per competition\n\n#### 0-fee trading ($0)\n\n- Users will be able to open and close positions for free or a relatively nominal fee. We may implement this through rebates. There will still be borrowing interest while positions are kept open.\n- This is technically $0 cost required up-front. The cost is to missed revenue during this period, but this should be an effective promotional campaign to get traders to at least try the new product.\n\nTotal rewards required for Perp launch is: **$225k - $350k**\n\n### AF 2.0\n\nFor the AF2.0 Money Market’s launch, we would like to incentivize lenders and borrowers to bootstrap the activities.\n\n- **Target TVL:** $100Mn\n- **Target APR%:** ~1% higher than the benchmark platform\n- **Duration:** 2 months\nTotal rewards required for AF2.0 MM launch is: **$250k - $275k.** You can see the analysis [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/129BnAicM2uUWvr2TSkABUbw1jLam3URC9RNWrzL1HnU/edit#gid=1790888313).\n\nIn total, we believe the total incentives in the range of **$475k - $625k** is required to maximize the chance of success for the upcoming product launches.\n\n> **Note:**\n> \n> - These figures are preliminary; once we have a total budget number from the Governance, a detailed rewards schedule can be created (e.g., higher incentive in the first month, etc).\n> - The incentivization period has to be long enough to make it worth it for new users to switch over, for which we’ve estimated 2 months to be the most appropriate. After the 2 month period, incentives are expected to no longer be required, and any potential additional incentives would have to be discussed in governance based on the status of the products at that time.\n\n## Where would the ALPACA come from?\n\nWe list below the sources where the ALPACA can come from:\n*(calculated based on price as of 16 January 2023)*\n\nPreviously collected fees that are waiting to be burned **$134k**\n\n* Liquidation fee: ~$72k USD ([link](https://bscscan.com/address/0x0FfA891ab6f410bbd7403b709e7d38D7a812125B))\n* xALPACA early withdrawal fee: ~$62k USD ([link](https://bscscan.com/address/0x2bfdacF6CdBC3ECcb95E68ec448ECf3d0693F732))\n\nUnclaimed ITAM rewards: **$417k** ([link](https://bscscan.com/address/0xa33ff77f414408797a27a0057afb51d2df50ce58#tokentxns))\n\n* Please note that this amount will only be eligible for burn, if unclaimed, after 15 March 2023 as per the AIP-1. You can read more details here: https://docs.alpacafinance.org/governance/aip-details/aip-1-handling-of-itam-rewards We believe that majority of it will be unclaimed as the amount has been available and sitting unclaimed for 9+ months.\n\nBased on the two sources above (pending how much ITAM rewards will be claimed by the deadline) we will be roughly at the low-mid range of the estimated required ALPACA. We recommend that these two sources should be utilized first. Any additional requirements can come from other sources listed below.\n\n### Potential additional sources of ALPACA\n\n\n#### Buyback and Burn\n\n* This recurring revenue sources currently generates ~$20k - $25k per week.\n* We can execute the buybacks as usual. However, the burn will be paused / reduced to save up ALPACA to be used as incentives for the new products.\n* The burn can resume after we have saved up enough ALPACA to an agreed amount.\n* Once the new products are successful, their increased usage would lead to additional burn from the new revenue sources\n\n#### ALPACA emissions\n\n* A portion or all of the remaining ALPACA emissions could be redirected to save up for future product incentives.\n* If we save up the entire emissions for February, we would have roughly 240k ALPACA ($64k)\n\n#### Governance Vault\n\n* Weekly distribution to the Governance Vault is roughly ~$15k per week.\n* Given that currently 50% of the Governance Vaut yield is already being redirected to cover bad debt, we believe this source should not be used, so that we still provide reasonable APR% and incentive for stakers to keep ALPACA locked.\n\n#### Warchest:\n\n* There is ~5.6 million ALPACA ($1.36Mn) remaining that can be minted from the Warchest, which exists to be used as expenses for the next ~2 year period.\n* Unlike other options above, by minting from the Warchest, the circulating supply of ALPACA will increase because Warchest allocation is not minted in advance.\n* Since there is a fixed, limited amount of Warchest that can be used, which is required for operational expenses, and the fact that it will increase circulating supply, it’s the team's opinion that this should be the last option to consider.\n\nWe can fund the upper range of the incentives by pausing the burn for ~ 3-4 weeks. You can view the analysis in this [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/129BnAicM2uUWvr2TSkABUbw1jLam3URC9RNWrzL1HnU/edit#gid=1852572379).\n\n## What is the mechanic to distribute these ALPACA rewards?\n\nWe list some possible options with their pros and cons.\n\n### Option1: Distribute rewards as ALPACA\n\nRewards will be distributed as ALPACA, the same way as it is now\n\n**Estimated development time:** 1 - 2 weeks\n\n**Pros:**\n\n- Simple to implement\n- No audit required\n\n**Cons:**\n\n- Rewards more likely to be sold in short-term\n\n### Option2: Distribute rewards as ALPACA with a vesting schedule\n\nInstead of giving out ALPACA tokens immediately, users will need to wait for a period of time (e.g., 6 months) before receiving the tokens.\n\n**Estimated development time:** 2 - 3 weeks\n\n**Pros:**\n\n* Relatively simple to implement; we only need to create a new vesting contract\n* Lower immediate selling pressure from the added vesting period\n* Given the simplicity of the contract, an Internal audit will provide sufficient security\n\n**Cons:**\n\n* Rewards still likely to be sold after vesting period ends\n\n### Option3: Distribute rewards as xALPACA locked for 1 year\n\nThis distribution method is what was proposed in the original forum post for ALPACAv2, where instead of giving out ALPACA as token rewards, we will give xALPACA locked for 1 year.\n\n**Estimated development time:** 4 - 6 weeks\n\n**Pros:**\n\n* No immediate selling pressure - new emissions will be unable to dilute ALPACA tokens until they unlock after a year, or until the holder decides to take a significant haircut on their tokens through an early withdrawal (up to -39%)\n* New users are incentivized to hold ALPACA as they receive Governance Vault’s yields\n* New users more likely to extend lockup time\n* New users incentivized to participate in governance, strengthening their belonging to the Herd\n\n**Cons:**\n\n* Requires significant development effort.

This has similar functionality to xALPACA but adds an additional vesting layer with the key properties below:\n\n* esALPACA cannot be transferred or sold\n* esALPACA can be staked for yields in its own staking vault\n  * Governance Vault stakers will vote on the percentage of the platform revenue to allocate for esALPACA staking vault\n  * At the end of the 3-months period, based on the figure presented above, there will roughly be 2Mn - 4Mn esALPACA (vs. 37Mn xALPACA currently) This means, for example, that if we allocate 5% of the Governance Vault’s revenue to esALPACA staking vault, they would receive a comparable APR% to Governance’s vault stakers\n* esALPACA will have voting power\n  * It can be 1esALPACA = 1 vote = 1 xALPACA, or voting power for esALPACA can be lower\n* esALPACA can be turned into ALPACA by going through a vesting period (e.g., 6-12 months.). While vesting, user will not earn any rewards\n\n**Estimated development time:** 4 - 6 weeks\n\n**Pros:**\n\n* Strong incentives to hold esALPACA as stakers will earn yields (as long as a reasonable percentage of revenue is allocated to the staking vault) and have voting power. This aspect is similar to xALPACA\n* Strong incentive to not vest esALPACA as users won’t earn yields during the entire vesting period\n* No immediate selling pressure or dilution of ALPACA\n* Unlike other mechanics where ALPACA tokens must be available for claim right away, this mechanic allows for a “fund-as-you-go” setup because ALPACA is only available to claim 1 year after vesting\n\n**Cons:**\n\n* Requires significant development effort. In our opinion, while the effort would make sense if we were updating the entire tokenomics with a 10-year emissions schedule, in this context where the incentives might only be used for several months, the development effort is too high\n* Also requires an external audit ($10k - $15k)\n* Two separate staking vaults and two voting tokens will make our protocol more complicated for users, especially less experienced ones\n\n# Voting\n\n## This is the First vote in a series of votes for this AIP.\n\nThe first vote will be a simple YES or NO vote on whether to incentivize the Perp and AF2.0 for their launches\n\n- A YES vote would mean we will provide incentives for the upcoming product launches\n- A NO vote would mean we do not provide any incentives to the upcoming product launches and the below votes would not take place",

      "title": " [AIP-14] Close remaining LYF positions on stkBNB-BNB pool to avoid any potential future bad debt",
      "content": "**Background:**\n--\n\nWith the recent temporary depegging of stkBNB, the liquidity pool on PancakeSwap for stkBNB-BNB has reduced in size to ~$480k USD. Moreover, PCS has removed the $CAKE rewards from the pool, making it highly unlikely for the pool to attract any additional TVL. This kind of low liquidity pool poses a higher risk of liquidation and potential bad debt.\n\nThere is currently ~$435k USD farming in LYF through Alpaca Finance on the stkBNB-BNB pool.\n\nRationale:\n--\n\nBy closing out remaining positions, we help secure the platform for both lenders and in-active leveraged yield farmers. If you still have active positions in this pool, we highly recommend that you close them now.\n\nWe outline recommend the steps below to close your positions, based on their current debt ratio::\n\n**Your position’s debt ratio < 50%**\n\n* Your position already has enough BNB to pay back the loan in your farming assets. You can close your position without incurring any swap fees.\n* We highly recommend that you close your position using the “Minimize Trading” option to avoid any swap.\n* This means you will receive stkBNB back, which you can then turn into BNB, if you wish, through the unstaking process or swapping at a small amount at a time to avoid the large price impact.\n\n**Your position’s debt ratio > 50%**\n\n* Your position **DOES NOT** have enough BNB in the farming assets to pay back the loan. This means if you close your position, a swap is required.\n* If your position size is large, the price impact incurred could be very high. In this scenario, we highly recommend you perform an “Add Collateral” function to bring down your debt ratio to <= 50% before closing your position.\n* When adding collateral, we recommend you add stkBNB and BNB in equal proportion to minimize any swaps required.\n\nImplementation:\n--\n\nWe will follow a similar approach to AIP4.2 (https://docs.alpacafinance.org/governance/aip-details/aip-4.2-solution-to-eliminate-bad-debt-risks-from-remaining-waultswap-positions) where we closed out positions on WaultSwap.\n\nBelow please find the implementation plan:\n\n1. We will upgrade the stkBNB-BNB farming contract to allow for a privileged address (i.e., dev controlled address) to liquidate any remaining positions in the vault.\n2. We will change the liquidation method. Instead of swapping non-borrowed tokens in the DEX (this could cause bad debt due to low liquidity), we will use oracle price and let the new liquidation strategy deduct the necessary amount from our wallet as determined by the Oracle with a 5% discount.\n3. Farming positions will now have all base assets and be able to pay back debt and close the positions\n4. Any remaining value after debt repayment is sent back to users\n\nIn Step #2, Alpaca Core team will provide the BNB liquidity required to close the positions. We will then unstake the stkBNB to receive back BNB. To eliminate the risks from BNB price fluctuation, the team will have short position to hedge the BNB exposure during the 2-weeks unstaking period. If there is any profit after (in USD terms), we will use them to buyback ALPACA and burn.\n\nVoting\n--\nThis AIP will be a simple YES or NO vote.\n\n- A YES vote would  close out any remaining positions on the stkBNB-BNB pool.\n- A NO vote would leave the positions opened.",

      "title": " [AIP-12] Handling of bad debt from the recent stkBNB’s depeg",
      "content": "**Background:**\n--\n\nAs many of you are aware, on 2nd December, there was an exploit on Ankr BNB (aBNBc) which caused a temporary depeg of stkBNB’s price, due to the dumping of aBNBc in pools shared with stkBNB on other protocols, which allowed the exploiter to drain stkBNB and subsequently sell it in other pools. Alpaca Guard worked as intended and [managed to save a noteworthy % of positions](https://twitter.com/AlpacaFinance/status/1598685838686138368) from liquidation. However, due to the extent and duration of the depeg, some LYF positions on the stkBNB-BNB pairs were still liquidated and the platform incurred some bad debt.\n\nYou can read more details from our tweet here: https://twitter.com/AlpacaFinance/status/1598685838686138368\n\n**Proposed implementation:**\n--\n\nThe total bad debt from this incident is **1,587.87 BNB** which represents ~0.2% of the lending TVL at the time of the event.\n\nYou can see the detailed breakdown of liquidations here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1KA3NXXrnWvo4MaDx-BOWdvEU8c_alBhclYCVEksbFSk/edit#gid=1119361929\n\nWe are putting this up for the discussion to activate the Insurance Plan, so xALPACA holders can vote for if the event fits the conditions to be covered by the Insurance Plan. As a reminder, you can read more about how our Insurance Plan works here: https://docs.alpacafinance.org/our-protocol-1/security#e8ee\n\n> What the Alpaca Insurance Plan covers\n> \n> It will cover any shortfall event for which Alpaca Finance’s code or  infrastructure is responsible, including: bad debt for lenders, smart contract risk, exploits, economic design failure, severe oracle integration failure, etc.\n\nIn this specific case for stkBNB where the depeg happened due to events on a sequence of external protocols (ankr exploit → stkbnb wombat pool), and our liquidation engine and Oracle Guard still worked as intended, one could argue that Alpaca Finance’s code or infrastructure was not responsible. \n\nUltimately, it's up to xALPACA holders to decide if this event falls under the cover conditions, keeping in mind that fair activation of the Alpaca Insurance Plan is what gives lenders and users of our platform confidence to use it, which ultimately drives all the protocol revenue coming into Governance.\n\nPlease note that we’ve discussed with Ankr, pStake, and Binance about if they can do anything to cover the losses from stkBNB, and none of them have given a positive response. So at this point, the Insurance Plan is the only avenue to cover the bad debt.\n\nTo summarize the key point, if the Insurance Plan covers this, 50% of the protocol revenue going to Governance will be used to cover this bad debt until it is paid off to BNB lending. The locked ALPCA in governance will not be touched and the remaining 50% of protocol revenue will still be paid out to Governance during this time.\n\nAs for any losses to the LYF positions that were liquidated, unfortunately, since the protocol operated as designed during liquidation, it does not fall under the cover terms of the Insurance Plan. So this discussion, and subsequent vote, would only be to cover the aforementioned bad debt to lending.\n\n**Voting**\n--\n\nThis AIP will be a simple YES or NO vote. Where the YES vote would activate the insurance plan and start directing 50% of the protocol revenue going to Governance to cover the bad debt until the full amount is paid off.\n\nA NO vote would not activate the insurance plan.",

One of the levers we have to help restore the peg is by adjusting the Stability Fee to incentivize some of the borrowers to buyback AUSD and return them, which would help restore the peg.\n\nRationale:\n--\n\n* Stability Fee is one of the levers we can use to help increase / reduce AUSD supply which in turn will affect the price of AUSD\n* There isn’t currently enough revenue to restore the peg in a reasonable period of time.\n\nImplementation:\n--\n\n* In order to restore the peg, we would like to propose increasing the stability fees\n* We would raise the stability fee to the level such that the net APR% for the avg. borrowers in the vault become approx. zero.\n* If these borrowers use AUSD to provide liquidity in the AUSD-3EPSLP pool, they will still be net positive (~6% yields) and earn money from staking.\n* However, if they use AUSD to “loop” or their positions have higher utilization than the avg. borrower, they will be incentivized to return a portion of their AUSD.\n* We will monitor and further adjust the interest rate as required (i.e., lower back down if peg is restored, etc.)\n* We will also reduce the AUSD cap for each pool so that no new positions can be created while AUSD is still off-peg\n* The proposed adjustment value are shown in the table below:\n\n|Assets|Current Stability Fees|Proposed Stability Fees|\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|USDT|2.0%|3.25%|\n|BUSD|2.0%|3.25%|\n\nThe Team will also have to ability to adjust the interest from time-to-time to maintain peg.\n\nFor the analysis, please refer to this spreadsheet: [Stability Fees Analysis - Google Sheets ](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19FA-9iYwo0VLwOqzK6OlSjTcKnashIAlAuHR-xEFQcI/edit#gid=0)\n\nVoting\n--\n\nThis proposal will be a simple YES or NO vote.\n\nYES would start implementing the proposed fee adjustment above while NO would keep the interest model as is.",

      "title": " [AIP-10] Further optimizing the borrowing interest rate slope",
      "content": "Background\n--\n\nAIP-5 ([LINK ](https://snapshot.org/#/alpacafinance.eth/proposal/0x3d7abd61ef0560febf667ce4754fc7bc0c76cc99d654cd53aebfd5d3b486af1c)) aimed to improve the utilization of the lending vaults by adjusting the slope2 interest rate as well as the kink (utilization at which Slope2 begins.) In discussion with our research team, we believe there is a way to further optimize the interest slope model that will benefit lenders and borrowers\n\nIn a nutshell, we will:\n\n* Lower Slope2 interest rate to approx. the current borrowing rate\n* Lower the kink for slope2 to approx. the current utilization rate\n\nRationale\n--\n\n* Given the current yields on DEXs, we are unlikely to get more borrowing demand on the current interest model as it will put marginal yields for LYF in the negative territory. This means the utilization rate will likely hover in this range (which it has been over the recent months.)\n* By lowering the interest rate and the kink as proposed, we will create a large region where the borrowing rate is constant and profitable, making LYF more attractive to farmers as the cost of borrowing becomes predictable.\n* The adjustment will also make AVs more profitable and greatly simplify the future adjustment required when we add new capacity to the AVs, which we hope to do after the repurchasing full rollout.\n* Lenders will still receive higher yields from higher utilization (see attached Google sheet below)\n* There will be no impact to current yield and protocol revenue. We are not making any changes to the interest model at lower utilization, so this change will have no negative impact to the protocol and lenders. The changes only impact incremental borrowing demand.\n* We still keep the slope3 interest rate unchanged. This means once utilization gets beyond 90%, the rate will increase rapidly to make sure there will be enough liquidity for withdrawal.\n\nImplementation\n--\n\nWe propose the following target interest models for each asset:\n\nSlope2 Kink: utilization at which Slope2 begins\n\nSlope2 Interest: the borrowing interest rate for Slope2 (the flat part)\n\n|Token|Slope2 kink utilization|Slope2 Interest|\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|BNB|50%|10%|\n|BUSD|30%|8%|\n|USDT|40%|8%|\n\nSee attached sheet for reference: [Interest Model Adjustment - Google Sheets ](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xVGEmjbcXb38NMYUavIkw83jgFVFXCsL719XpaxGd1s/edit#gid=0)\n\n–\n*We will apply the the changes to the BNB, BUSD, USDT first since they are the largest vaults. Similar approach can also be taken for the remaining asset pools\n\nVoting\n--\n\nThis proposal will be a simple YES or NO vote.\n\nYES would start implementing the proposed interest model above while NO would keep the interest model as is.",

      "title": "[AIP-9] Deposit Liquidation Treasury Funds into Lending Pools while waiting to be used for buyback ",
      "content": "Summary:\n--\nDeposit a portion of liquidation treasury funds into Alpaca lending pools while waiting to be used for buyback\n\nMotivation / Rationale:\n--\nLiquidation treasury can build up to high value after a big market move, such as now. (mostly in stablecoins) sitting in the liquidation treasury. By depositing a portion of them in the lending pools, liquidation treasury can earn roughly $70 per day (using the current APRs for each stablecoin), and increase the TVL of our protocol by almost $1 million.\n\nThis proposal does not require any development effort, while providing a small increase in TVL and daily income to grow the liquidation treasury. It will also marginally reduce interest rates especially for low liquidity coins like USDC, which may also encourage more LYF users, further increasing TVL.\n\nThis strategy incurs small additional risks vs. just holding the fund. If bad debt occurs in the lending pools, the principle for buyback will be reduced.\n\nImplementation:\n--\n\n- Deposit all stablecoins in liquidation wallet (minus the required amount for current’s week buyback) into the lending pools\n- Stake ibTokens for ALPACA rewards which will be used for additional burn\n- Withdraw the necessary amount for buybacks at the end of each week\n- At the end of each week, withdraw the necessary amount for the planned buyback of the following week, taking into account leftover stablecoins or new liquidation funds in the treasury. If there is a surplus, deposit the surplus stable coins into the lending pools and stake the ib tokens.\n- The same can be done with crypto such as BNB, ETH and BTC if the market picks up again and shorts are liquidated\n\nVoting:\n--\n\nThis proposal will be a simple YES or NO vote.\n\nYES would start implementing the plan above while NO would keep the fund in the liquidation treasury as is.",

This option will provide the highest capital efficiency for our users as they will continue to earn yields from trading fees. The locked LP tokens will also be staked in the FairLaunch contract on users’ behalf to continue receiving ALPACA rewards\n\nStaked duration: user can choose the lock duration between 1 - 52 weeks. Similar to Governance vault, the longer the duration, the higher allocation they will receive.\n\nAllocation: We propose a similar structure to xALPACA where $x worth of LP tokens locked for 1 year to receive $1 dollar of allocation in the high-leveraged AVs. The community will vote on what the $x should be.\n\nOther implementation notes:\n--\n\nSince users can add any combination of tokens in the AUSD3EPS LP token, we will limit the total AUSD that can be borrowed if the price falls below a pre-determined threshold. This would force users who want access to either add other stablecoins in the pool (e.g., BUSD, USDT, etc.) or purchase AUSD from open market to add to the pool. Both of these actions would help increase AUSD price to the peg.\n\nVoting:\n--\nFor absolute clarity and fairness, we will do a series of two votes for this AIP. This is the first vote in the series of two votes.\n\n**First Vote:** The first vote has passed.\n\n**Second Vote:**This is the second vote to determine the parameters for limiting access to the vaults.\n\nThis vote will be done through Ranked choice Voting as described below:\n\nRanked choice voting (IRV)\nEach voter may rank any number of choices. Votes are initially counted for each voter's top choice. If a candidate has more than half of the vote based on first-choices, that choice wins. If not, then the choice with the fewest votes is eliminated. The voters who selected the defeated choice as a first choice then have their votes added to the totals of their next choice. This process continues until a choice has more than half of the votes. When the field is reduced to two, it has become an \"instant runoff\" that allows a comparison of the top two choice head-to-head.\n\nOption1: $1.0 worth of AUSD3EPS locked for $1 allocation (same as xALPACA)\n\nOption2: $1.5 worth of AUSD3EPS locked for $1 allocation\n\nOption3: $2.0 worth of AUSD3EPS locked for $1 allocation\n\nOption4: $2.5 worth of AUSD3EPS locked for $1 allocation\n\nOption5: $3.0 worth of AUSD3EPS locked for $1 allocation.\n\nOption6. $3.5 worth of AUSD3EPS locked for $1 allocation.\n\nOption7. $4.0 worth of AUSD3EPS locked for $1 allocation.",

      "title": "[AIP-6.2] Limiting Access to Automated Vault",
      "content": "## Background:\n\nDue to strong demand for Automated Vaults and potentially limited capacity, some community members have requested that the core team put up some sort of limitation on who can invest in the Automated Vaults.\n\nBased on the current pool’s APR and liquidity, we estimate that an additional **~200 Mn TVL** can be accepted by the Automated Vaults at current metrics. While this number is not small, we believe that the demand will be higher, given a good track record so far of the vaults’ performance and the current market conditions.\n\n## Rationale:\n\nBy limiting access to certain Automated Vaults, we can add value to the Alpaca ecosystem and give privileged access to valued community members. So far, we have launched 3x and 8x Automated Vaults. Their characteristics have several differences (APY, Sharpe Ratio, max drawdown.) Depending on their goals, investors can choose a vault that is more suitable for them. So far though, the 8x vault has been more popular given its higher APY. And because of its higher leverage, the capacity gets filled up quickly, recently within minutes of launch.\n\nGiven the facts above, after an internal discussion, we are proposing categorizing Automated Vaults into two groups and limiting their access as follows:\n\n* **Low-Leverage Vaults:** allow public access to <= 4x Automated Vaults\n* **High-Leverage Vaults:** limit access for > 4x pools Automated Vaults to only xALPACA holders\n\n> While we have only offered 3x and 8x automated vaults so far, in the future, we could potentially offer other leverage -e.g, 4x, 5x, etc., vaults on LP pairs with lower underlying yields such that the APY is comparable to the higher yield pool such as BNB-USDT. Our goal is to keep the Vault’s APY roughly the same across different LP pools to minimize decision making / rotation for users to seek higher yield, which would cost gas and swap fees.\n\n## Implementation:\n\nOnly xALPACA holders will be able to invest in the high-leverage vaults. The max amount a user can invest in all pools will correspond to the xALPACA balance they have. We propose a linear & dynamic allocation quota as described below:\n\n**Linear:** the more xALPACA you hold, the higher allocation you get:\n\nExample:\n\n**2 xALPACA = $1 total allocation across all high-leverage vaults.**\n\n* Example: Alice has 10,000 xALPACA, she is entitled to invest up to $5,000 USD **across all high-leverage vaults.**\n* For clarity, this means that Alice, for example, can invest $2,000 in on high-leverage vault, $500 in another vault, and $2,500 in another vault etc. But overall when all her investments across all the high-leverage vaults are summed up, they cannot exceed $5,000.\n* The allocation is counted against the current value of the investment and not the cost-basis. So as the investment appreciates in value, it takes up additional allocation.\n\n**Dynamic:** ratio will be adjusted periodically based on ALPACA price.\n\n- Example: current ratio is 2xALPACA = $1 allocation. ALPACA price increases by 100%, the new ration becomes 1xALPACA = $1 allocation, maintaining a constant $ ratio allocation.\n\n**Other Implementation Notes:**\n\n* The allocation refers to equity value. So $1 allocation means you can supply $1 worth of asset to have $8 TVL in the vault (for 8x vault)\n\n- We will track the amount invested in each vault’s smart contract (and not # of share token in the wallet.) So users cannot game the system by transferring the token out of their wallets to gain additional allocation.\n* xALPACA balance will be determined in real-time (or weekly snapshot pending implementaion challenges), on-chain, at the time of the investment\n* It would add considerable implementation effort to account for cross-chain xALPACA balance, so the initial implementation will only be for BNB Chain stakers for access to high-leverage vaults on BNB Chain.\n* While this topic is in discussion, we will pause opening new high leverage vaults until the implementation of this proposal is completed (if passed.) Lower leverage vaults will continue to be added on a regular basis if the capacity is full in all the active vaults.\n* The estimated time for implementation is 2-3 weeks (once we add it to the sprint) If passed, you can expect it to go live towards the end of May.\n* We can’t do anything with the existing investors in the current high leverage vaults. However, once they withdraw, they can only invest back again if they meet the criteria.\n\n## Voting:\n\nFor absolute clarity and fairness, we will do a series of two votes for this AIP. This is the second vote in the series of two votes.\n\n**Second Vote:** The first vote passed. We are now having a second vote to determine the parameters for limiting access to the vaults.\n\nBased on the discussion and feedback so far, and in an effort to move this proposal forward in a reasonable time, I would like to propose that we lock in some of the mechanisms below:\n\n- Allocation will be across all high-leverage vaults\n- Linear Allocation\n- Dynamics ratio, adjusted on a monthly basis at the beginning of each month. - To prevent manipulation, we will use TWAP of ALPACA for the 1 week prior to the ratio adjustment.\n- Voting will be on setting the xALPACA allocation ratio only.\n\n**Option1:** $1.0 worth of ALPACA locked for $1 allocation\n\n**Option2:** $1.5 worth of ALPACA locked for $1 allocation\n\n**Option3:** $2.0 worth of ALPACA locked for $1 allocation\n\n**Option4:** $2.5 worth of ALPACA locked for $1 allocation\n\n**Option5:** $3.0 worth of ALPACA locked for $1 allocation.\n\nFor example, with ALPACA current price of $0.66, option#1 would require $1 / $0.66 = 1.5 xALPACA for $1 allocation. option#2 would require $1.5 / 0.66 = 2.30xALPACA for $1 allocation.",

      "title": "[AIP-5] Interest Model Adjustment",
      "content": "## Background:\n\nWhen we first launched Alpaca in March of 2021, the market was in a strong bull run.\n\nIt was a different environment with high speculative demand and higher yields. BNB Chain yields on DEXes (without leverage) were in the range of 50% - 100% APR for most pools. However, these yields dropped over time as more capital entered the market and farm tokens like CAKE depreciated in price.\n\n![](upload://2yTsmWUWJU3R552aZKaAwCe0YGk)\n\nToday, all the major farms have yields below 15% APR (as of 29th Mar 2022)\n\nPCS BNB-USDT: 15.01%\n\nPCS BNB-BUSD: 13.94%\n\nMDEX BNB-BUSD: 10.31%\n\nMDEX ETH-USDT: 13.31%\n\nWhat does this mean for our interest model? The 20% rate in slope2 is too high for the current yield environment and there will be very few borrowers at 20%. It’s just not profitable to do leveraged yield farming at that borrowing rate.\n\nAs a result, lending pools’ utilization rarely rises above ~40% (borrowing interest = 15% @ 40% utilization) This was evidenced in the major pools where utilization was hovering between 30% - 40% prior to Automated Vault’s launch.This leaves a lot of unborrowed capital on the sidelines, which also means lower APY for lenders.\n\nWe believe a more efficient “equilibrium” could be achieved by lowering the borrowing interest at slope2, which will create higher utilization while still maintaining the same, or even higher revenue, to the lenders.\n\n**Example:**\n\n|State|Supply (USD)|Borrowed (USD)|Borrowing Interest Rate|Annual Interest paid (USD)|Lenders APR|\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|State1|100|30|10%|3|3%|\n|State2|100|50|9%|4.5|4.5%|\n\nAs seen in the simple illustrative example above, with higher utilization, borrowers enjoy lower borrowing interest (10% → 9%) while lenders also earn higher yields (3% → 4.5%)\n\nThe question then is: how do we ensure there will be an increase in borrowing demand to increase utilization, compensating for the lower interest rate?\n\n## Challenges:\n\nWhile the core team has discussed this issue internally in the past, the question above is one of the reasons we have not lowered [Slope2 ](https://docs.alpacafinance.org/our-protocol-1/global-parameters/interest-rate-model) borrowing interest until now. There was no guarantee that with a shift in the interest model, there would be a corresponding increase in the borrowing demand.\n\nWith no new borrowing demand, lenders and our protocol would end up with less revenue, which could lead to lending deposit withdrawal, potentially creating a vicious cycle where the protocol lost significant TVL.\n\nIn fact, we tried with this back in Q3 of 2021 where we moved the Slope2 starting point from 50% utilization to 60% utilization to try to incentivize borrowers to open more positions, but it had no perceptible impact, and we didn’t pursue it further.\n\n## Rationale:\n\nWith the introduction of Automated Vaults, the situation has changed. We have seen a strong demand from the community for Automated Vaults, with the TVL cap for each 8x pool reached within a few hours of launch.\n\nSo with Automated Vaults, we now have high confidence that we could move our system to a higher utilization state where all the participants in the ecosystem will benefit.\n\nAdjusting the interest model would achieve five major benefits:\n\n* Higher APY for lenders\n* Lower borrowing interest rate for borrowers\n* Higher protocol revenue\n* Additional capacity for our Automated Vaults\n* Higher lending utilization which provides more platform stability\n\n## Proposed Implementation:\n\nWe propose the following target interest models for each asset:\n\nSlope2 Kink: utilization at which Slope2 begins\n\nSlope2 Interest: the borrowing interest rate for Slope2 (the flat part)\n\n|Asset|Slope2 kink|Slope2 interest|Lend APYs at Slope2|\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|BNB|85%|12.5%|~ 10% - 12%|\n|BUSD|85%|12.5%|~ 10% - 12%|\n|USDT|85%|12.5%|~ 10% - 12%|\n|BTC|85%|7.5%|~ 6% - 7%|\n|ETH|85%|7.5%|~ 6% - 7%|\n|USDC|85%|10.0%|~ 8% - 10%|\n\nAs seen above, if we can raise the utilization to Slope2 portion of the model, lenders would also benefit from higher lending APY%\n\nWe would not make this implementation in one go, but rather adjust the slope gradually for each token each time we add a new instance of an Automated Vault. This way, we can ensure that lenders and platform revenue will not be adversely affected by a change. The core team will have the discretion to adjust interest models within the boundary above. For example, slope2 kink for BNB will never be beyond 85% and the slope2 interest rate will not be set below 12.5%.\n\nThe diagram below illustrates how the interest slope will change. The specific parameters will be based on various parameters at the time - e.g., TVL, APR, etc.\n\n![](upload://ajczO7Q6AHifR1R08DhjLUKjH9g)\n\nVoting\n--\n\nA simple \"Yes\" or \"No\" vote will be used for the proposal",

( There needs to be a sufficient penalty so that those who would consider early withdrawal could not game the mechanism by choosing a long lockup duration for higher APR, and then withdrawing early. )\n\nExample:\n--\n>Alice wants to perform an early withdrawal of 100 locked ALPACA\n>from the Governance Vault, but her position still has 65 days locked\n>time remaining. Alice will have to pay:\n>\n>Penalty = 0.75% * roundup(65 / 7) = 7.5% of the withdrawn amount\n>\n>And she will receive: 100 ALPACA * (100% — 7.5%) = 92.5 ALPACA\n\nHow the penalty from early withdrawal above will be utilized is the focus of this discussion thread. In the article we proposed the following:\n\n50% of the penalty will go towards weekly burn\n50% will be distributed as rewards to the Governance Vault’s stakers in the following week.\n\nAIP discussion thread: https://forum.alpacafinance.org/t/aip-3-handling-of-governance-vaults-early-withdrawal-penalty/258\n\nVoting\n--\nFive voting choices are presented and users can vote by Ranked Choice Voting (IRV) .

      "title": "[AIP-2.2] Economics for Governance Vault on Fantom",
      "content": "This is the 2nd part of the AIP-2\n\nBackground:\n--\n\nOur Fantom’s farm has seen a steady growth with TVL over $37 Mn one week after launch. Our FTM and USDC lending pools also have the highest APY compared to other protocols on Fantom! With these strong metrics and our plan to launch more products on Fantom (as outlined here 4), we are confident Alpaca will grow to be one of the leading protocols on the chain.\n\nAs the platform grows, so does the protocol revenue. As a result, one of the questions many community members have been asking us is “What will happen to the protocol revenue generated on Fantom?”\n\nBelow, we’ll give some answers to that which will lead into a Proposal:\n\n- **Lending performance fee goes towards buyback&burn:** This is straightforward and how we already do it on BNB Chain. Since the $ALPACA on BNB Chain and Fantom have a shared supply, the buybacks benefit all ALPACA holders regardless of where they hold it.\n- **Revenue from the farming performance fee:** We believe what we do with this revenue channel warrants serious consideration because it can have a strong impact on Alpaca’s future growth prospects and token price. This will be the main topic of this discussion.\n- **Grazing Range Rewards:** Similar to above, how we decide to handle partners’ tokens will directly influence the attractiveness and success of our Grazing Range partnership program on Fantom.\n\nProposed Implementation:\n--\n\nFollowing the vote from AIP-2.1, we now have three options on how to distribute the economics\n\n**Option#1**\n\n- Create a Governance Vault on Fantom\n- 100% of revenue + GR rewards on Fantom get distributed to Governance Vault stakers on Fantom, similar to how we do it on BNB Chain\n\n**Option#2**\n\n- Create a Governance Vault on Fantom\n- A fixed portion of the revenue generated + GR rewards on Fantom get distributed back to Governance Vault stakers on BNB Chain while the rest are distributed to stakers on Fantom.\n\n**Option#3**\n\n- Create a Governance Vault on Fantom\n- Revenue generated on each chain are combined and distributed based on xALPACA amount on each chain so that the APR% achived in both governance vault are equal\nA fixed portion of GR rewards on Fantom get distributed back to Governance Vault stakers on BNB Chain (no selling of rewards token; must claim on Fantom)\n\n**We senior alpacas had a long discussion inside the barn, weighing pros and cons of the three options above, and after much deliberation, we believe Option #3 (or #4) is the best solution for our community.**\n\nIn the core team’s view, we believe 80% of Fantom’s revenue should go towards Fantom Governance Vault stakers while 20% would be distributed to Governance stakers on BNB Chain.\n\nSimilarly, 80% of the GR rewards from Fantom partners will be awarded to Fantom stakers, while the remaining 20% can be claimed by BNB Chain stakers on Fantom.\n\nThe GR portions of rewards for BNB Chain stakers will have to be claimed on Fantom using the same wallet addresses they stake on BNB Chain’s Governance, while the revenue portion will be bridged over and claimed together with the other rewards on BNB Chain.\n\nApart from the revenue distribution aspect, the other parameters on the Governance Vault will be the same between chains, these include:\n\n- Minimum & maximum lock time\n- Early withdrawal fee\n- Equal voting power; 1xALPACA on Fantom = 1xALPACA on BNB Chain\nWe explain our rationale below…\n\nRationales:\nBuild value and incentive to hold ALPACA: Without a Governance Vault on Fantom, it will be difficult to build value for ALPACA on the chain. It will be easier for users to sell their ALPACA rewards than to bridge it back to BNB Chain and go through all the steps of setting themselves up on a new network to stake ALPACA, and this would negatively affect the price for all holders. Moreover, users that do not hold our governance token will have a weaker relationship with the project , making it difficult for us to truly grow a strong Herd on Fantom and any new chains we expand to in the future.\n\nStrong value proposition for our GR partners: With our proposed option, in addition to getting exposure to Fantom users, our partners will also get access to BNB Chain users which they might not have access to otherwise. (BNB Chain governance vault stakers will have to claim their GR rewards on Fantom, which would bring in a bunch of new users to Fantom, giving GR partners exposure to them.) We believe this makes the value proposition of our program very strong. Without many loyal ALPACA holders on Fantom, it will otherwise be difficult to convince GR partners to join our program, and that means less rewards for ALPACA holders and less demand to hold the token.\n\nRewarding our loyal early adopters: BNB Chain is our birthplace and we couldn’t have grown to this point without the strong support of our users and loyal Herd. Thus, it’s only fair that as we expand to other chains, a portion of the revenue gets allocated back to stakers on BNB Chain, which can be considered the main operating base for Alpaca. This also makes it so BNB Chain stakers will not have to worry about what is the best chain to lock up in; They can lock up on BNB Chain, and know they’ll get some rewards from Fantom and other chains.\n\nVoting\n--\n\nFor absolute clarity and fairness, we decided to hold a series of two votes: THIS IS THE SECOND VOTE OF THAT SERIES.\n\n- Option1: 100% of revenue + GR rewards on Fantom get distributed to Governance Vault stakers on Fantom, similar to how we do it on BNB Chain\n\n- Option2: A fixed portion of the revenue generated + GR rewards on Fantom get distributed back to Governance Vault stakers on BNB Chain while the rest are distributed to stakers on Fantom.\n\n- Option3: Revenue generated on each chain are combined and distributed based on xALPACA amount on each chain so that the APR% achived in both governance vault are equal (i.e., pro-rata distribution.) A fixed portion of GR rewards on Fantom get distributed back to Governance Vault stakers on BNB Chain (no selling of rewards token; must claim on Fantom)\n\nNote on implementation\n--\nRegardless of which option wins, the step in implementing this AIP will be as follow:\n\n1.) Implement Option#1 now, regardless of the voting outcome.\n\n2.) If Option2 or Option3 wins, we will only start the additional development for those options when the TVL on Fantom is > 15% that of BNB Chain. (This would roughly put Fantom’s TVL at $125 mil. A lower TVL would be an inefficient use of dev’s time)\n\n** Note that depending on when the TVL target on Fantom hits, the development team might not be able to start development of it right away pending on-going work, but it will be scheduled into the next available sprint.**",

      "title": "[AIP-2.1] Governance Vault on Fantom",
      "content": "\nThis is the first vote on the series of 2 votes on the issue of Governance Vault on Fantom.\n\nReference: https://forum.alpacafinance.org/t/aip-2-governance-vault-on-fantom/211\n\nBackground:\n-\n\nOur Fantom’s farm has seen a steady growth with TVL over $37 Mn one week after launch. Our FTM and USDC lending pools also have the highest APY compared to other protocols on Fantom! With these strong metrics and our plan to launch more products on Fantom (as outlined here 3), we are confident Alpaca will grow to be one of the leading protocols on the chain.\n\nAs the platform grows, so does the protocol revenue. As a result, one of the questions many community members have been asking us is “What will happen to the protocol revenue generated on Fantom?”\n\nBelow, we’ll give some answers to that which will lead into a Proposal:\n\n- **Lending performance fee goes towards buyback&burn:** This is straightforward and how we already do it on BNB Chain. Since the $ALPACA on BNB Chain and Fantom have a shared supply, the buybacks benefit all ALPACA holders regardless of where they hold it.\n\n- **Revenue from the farming performance fee:** We believe what we do with this revenue channel warrants serious consideration because it can have a strong impact on Alpaca’s future growth prospects and token price. This will be the main topic of this discussion.\n\n- **Grazing Range Rewards:** Similar to above, how we decide to handle partners’ tokens will directly influence the attractiveness and success of our Grazing Range partnership program on Fantom.\n\nProposed Implementation:\n-\nThere are several ways to implement how we do revenue sharing on Fantom:\n\n**Option#1**\n\n- Create a Governance Vault on Fantom\n- 100% of revenue + GR rewards on Fantom get distributed to Governance Vault stakers on Fantom, similar to how we do it on BNB Chain\n\n**Option#2**\n\n- No Governance Vault on Fantom\n- All revenue from Fantom gets bridged and then distributed to Governance Vault stakers on BNB Chain\n\n**Note:** For this option, while implementable technically, the Grazing Range could become much less attractive to our partners on Fantom. Without many loyal ALPACA holders on Fantom, it will be difficult to convince GR partners to join our program, and that means less rewards for ALPACA holders and less demand to hold the token.\n\n**Option#3**\n\n- Create a Governance Vault on Fantom\n- A fixed portion of the revenue generated + GR rewards on Fantom get distributed back to Governance Vault stakers on BNB Chain while the rest are distributed to stakers on Fantom.\n\n**Option#4**\n\n- Create a Governance Vault on Fantom\n- Revenue generated on each chain are combined and distributed based on xALPACA amount on each chain so that the APR% achived in both governance vault are equal\n- A fixed portion of GR rewards on Fantom get distributed back to Governance Vault stakers on BNB Chain (no selling of rewards token; must claim on Fantom)\n\n**We senior alpacas had a long discussion inside the barn, weighing pros and cons of the three options above, and after much deliberation, we believe Option #3 (or #4) is the best solution for our community.**\n\nIn the core team’s view, we believe 80% of Fantom’s revenue should go towards Fantom Governance Vault stakers while 20% would be distributed to Governance stakers on BNB Chain.\n\nSimilarly, 80% of the GR rewards from Fantom partners will be awarded to Fantom stakers, while the remaining 20% can be claimed by BNB Chain stakers on Fantom.\n\nThe GR portions of rewards for BNB Chain stakers will have to be claimed on Fantom using the same wallet addresses they stake on BNB Chain’s Governance, while the revenue portion will be bridged over and claimed together with the other rewards on BNB Chain.\n\nApart from the revenue distribution aspect, the other parameters on the Governance Vault will be the same between chains, these include:\n\nMinimum & maximum lock time\nEarly withdrawal fee\nEqual voting power; 1xALPACA on Fantom = 1xALPACA on BNB Chain\nWe explain our rationale below…\n\nRationales:\n-\n\n- **Build value and incentive to hold ALPACA:** Without a Governance Vault on Fantom, it will be difficult to build value for ALPACA on the chain. It will be easier for users to sell their ALPACA rewards than to bridge it back to BNB Chain and go through all the steps of setting themselves up on a new network to stake ALPACA, and this would negatively affect the price for all holders. Moreover, users that do not hold our governance token will have a weaker relationship with the project , making it difficult for us to truly grow a strong Herd on Fantom and any new chains we expand to in the future.\n\n- **Strong value proposition for our GR partners:** With our proposed option, in addition to getting exposure to Fantom users, our partners will also get access to BNB Chain users which they might not have access to otherwise. (BNB Chain governance vault stakers will have to claim their GR rewards on Fantom, which would bring in a bunch of new users to Fantom, giving GR partners exposure to them.) We believe this makes the value proposition of our program very strong. Without many loyal ALPACA holders on Fantom, it will otherwise be difficult to convince GR partners to join our program, and that means less rewards for ALPACA holders and less demand to hold the token.\n\n- **Rewarding our loyal early adopters:** BNB Chain is our birthplace and we couldn’t have grown to this point without the strong support of our users and loyal Herd. Thus, it’s only fair that as we expand to other chains, a portion of the revenue gets allocated back to stakers on BNB Chain, which can be considered the main operating base for Alpaca. This also makes it so BNB Chain stakers will not have to worry about what is the best chain to lock up in; They can lock up on BNB Chain, and know they’ll get some rewards from Fantom and other chains.\n\nVoting\n-\n\n**For absolute clarity and fairness, we decided to hold a series of two votes:** THIS IS THE FIRST VOTE OF THAT SERIES.\n\n\nFist vote: Determine if we should add governance for Fantom or not\n\n- **Option1:** Have a Governance Vault on Fantom\n\n- **Option2:** No Governance Vault on Fantom\n\nSecond vote: If the vote passes as a yes to governance, we will have a second vote (to be crated later), which will determine the mechanics of the Governance Vault\n",

      "content": "\nBackground:\n---\n\n1.) ITAM was the first Grazing Range partnership which ran in April - May of 2021. These ITAM rewards were provided as extra rewards to ITAM-BNB farmers and BNB lenders. The distribution was completely different than our later Grazing Ranges. It’s not the case that users were staking explicitly to receive these rewards.\n\n3.) Currently there are ~917k unclaimed ITAM (~USD 500k)\n\n4.) ITAM was recently acquired and any tokens not swapped by March 31st 2022 will lose all of its utility\n\nSee excerpt below:\n\nITAM-to-ITAMCUBE token swap portal will close in [11:59PM UST] March 31, 2022.\n\n“With this said, the token swap portal will close at the end of next month. If you have not yet swapped your ITAM token to ITAM CUBE token, we strongly ask you to do so as quickly as possible. For any ITAM token that has not been swapped afterwards will lose all its utility. We sincerely hope we can make it clear that Netmarble F&C will NOT support ITAM token and will NOT use ITAM token in any of its services and initiatives. Only ITAM CUBE.”\n\nOriginal article: ITAM to ITAM CUBE Token Swap will close in March 31, 2022 | by ITAM CUBE | ITAM Cube | Feb, 2022 | Medium\n\nFor more details, please refer to the forum discussion on this topic: https://forum.alpacafinance.org/t/aip-1-handling-of-the-unclaimed-itam-rewards/172\n\nImplementation: \n---\n\nAfter discussions and feedback from the community, we will provide 2 voting choices:\n\n**Option1:)** Convert 100% of ITAM to ITAMCUBE. Sell ITAMCUBE on MEXC to USDT. Swap USDT to ALPACA on BNB Chain. Allow for additional 12 months for claiming. Any unclaimed ALPACA will be burned.  Due to number of character constraints on Snapshot, this option will be labeled as \"Sell ITAMCUBE to ALPACA\"\n\n(there is now enough liquidity on MEXC to convert all ITAMCUBE amount w/ < 5% slippage which is better than trading ITAM directly on PCS.)\n\n**Option2:)** Convert 100% of ITAM into ITAMCUBE. Allow for additional 12 months for claiming. Any unclaimed ITAMCUBE after 12 months will be swapped into ALPACA and burned. Due to number of character constraints on Snapshot, this option will be labeled as \"Keep ITAMCUBE\"\n",
