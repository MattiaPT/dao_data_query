      "title": "[SEP 45] Implementation of Transition Period for Committees and Councils Structure",
      "content": "Please refer to the [full proposal text on the SafeDAO forum](https://forum.safe.global/t/sep-45-implementation-of-transition-period-for-committees-and-councils-structure/5719). Some parts may have been removed to fit within the character limit on Snapshot.\n\n### Authors:\n\nAndre Geest (Safe, @Andre), Amy (Safe, @amy.sg)\n\n### Created:\n\n2024-09-09\n\n## Abstract\nThis proposal aims to signal SafeDAO’s intent to move forward with [a Committees and Councils Structure](https://forum.safe.global/t/discussion-introducing-steering-committees-and-council-structures/5718) and introduce a transition period to allow sufficient time for its full implementation. The proposal includes the temporary pause for funding new OBRA initiatives and an extension of the soft launch provision for Season 4.\n\n### Proposal types\n\n[ ] SEP: Constitutional Proposals\n[X] SEP: Governance Proposals\n[ ] Other SEPs\n\n## Proposal details\n\nPurpose and Background\n\n### Background:\n\nIn this governance amendment sprint, the [Committees and Council Structure proposal](https://forum.safe.global/t/discussion-introducing-steering-committees-and-council-structures/5718) was introduced to resolve SafeDAO’s most pressing resource allocation pain points. However, the robustness of the proposal deserves ample time to discuss, shape and transition into the structure.\n\nBy allowing this transition period, SafeDAO ensures that the governance structure is carefully considered and well-aligned with the goals as outlined in its Constitution. Pausing OBRA during this time helps maintain focus on the strategic shift and mitigates risks associated with overlapping governance structures.\n\n### Proposal Details:\n\n**1. Signal support for committees and councils structure**\n\n* The ratification of this proposal signals the intention to move forward with the proposed Committees and Councils Structure, as outlined in the [Committees and Council Structure Proposal.](https://forum.safe.global/t/discussion-introducing-steering-committees-and-council-structures/5718)\n* While this signaling is non-binding, (the Committees and Council Structure proposal must be separately formally ratified through a vote to be implemented), it serves as a strategic direction for governance improvements.\n* Full details of the structure, responsibilities, and processes will be iterated on until submission into Phase 1 by the Governance team for Season 4 Sprint 1 with the proposal intended to go into effect in Season 4 Sprint 2.\n\n**2. Pause new OBRA initiatives for Season 4 Sprint 1**\n\n* To ensure a smooth transition to the new governance model, OBRA (Outcomes-based resource allocation) will be paused for one sprint until the full implementation of the council structure in Season 4 Sprint 2.\n* During the pause, no new funding initiatives can be submitted through OBRA, allowing the DAO to focus on finalizing the council structure.\n* Initiatives with ongoing funding are not affected.\n\n**3. Extension of Soft Launch Provision**\n\n* At the launch of the governance framework, [a soft launch provision](https://forum.safe.global/t/sep-8-outcomes-based-resource-allocation-framework-obra/4376#f-soft-launch-18) was implemented, which allows the SEF to deviate from the governance cycles if necessary to give SafeDAO the possibility to vote in a flexible manner, ensuring an efficient decision-making process. This has been extended for subsequent seasons.\n* The soft launch provision for the governance framework and OBRA will be extended for the entirety of Season 4.\n* This will provide time for further refinement and feedback on the proposed structure before full rollout in Season 4 Sprint 2, ensuring the governance framework aligns with DAO goals and needs.\n\n### Timeline:\n\n* **Season 4 Sprint 1:** Governance team to finalize details for the Committees and Councils Structure.\n* **Season 4 Sprint 2:** Full implementation of the Committees and Councils Structure and resumption of OBRA.\n\n## Effects and Impact Analysis\n\n1. This proposal signals support for the transition to the Committees and Councils Structure: This signal is non-binding, yet offers a strategic direction for governance improvements.\n\n2. This proposal suggests no new OBRA funding initiatives submitted for Season 4 Sprint 1: The temporary pause on new OBRA initiatives ensures focus on the transition without overlapping frameworks. While this may delay new funding initiatives, it promotes a more cohesive governance model.\n\n3. This proposal extends the soft launch provision: This extension prevents the transition being faced by the governance cycles as a roadblock, providing flexibility to refine and propose changes to the structure at any sprint in the season based on feedback.\n\n## Alternative Solutions\n\n1. **Immediate implementation of the Committees and Councils Structure:** This approach could create confusion and inefficiencies due to insufficient time for proper planning and feedback, leading to potential governance misalignment.\n2. **Continuation of OBRA initiatives without pausing:** This would result in overlapping governance structures where initiatives get funded although SafeDAO signaled to move to a new structure. This makes it harder to focus on the transition and dilutes attention from the new model's implementation. Additionally, pausing the acceptance of new initiatives also allows for prudent budgeting, as the funds can be strategically reallocated within the new council structure, enhancing financial efficiency.\n3. **Delaying the transition until Season 5**: While providing more time, it risks significantly delaying necessary governance improvements.\n\n## Implementation\n\n[X ] Own implementation possible\n[ ] Own implementation but with funding (how much % to implementation)\n[ ] Request for technical support through Safe matter experts\n\n## Open Questions\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via CC0.",

Some parts may have been removed to fit within the character limit on Snapshot.\n\nLink to previous discussion: https://forum.safe.global/t/discussion-creating-safedao-s-first-revenue-stream-through-community-aligned-fees/5684\n\n### **Title**:\n[Draft] Creating SafeDAO’s first revenue stream through Community-Aligned Fees \n\n### **Authors**:\n@Christoph (Safe Ecosystem Foundation), @Andre (Safe Ecosystem Foundation)\n\n###  **Created**: 2024-08-29\n\n## **Abstract**\n\nThis proposal introduces SafeDAO’s first revenue stream which strengthens token utility, community governance and empowers the vibrance of the ecosystem. \n\n## **Proposal types**\n\nState which proposal type this proposal belongs to.\n[] SEP: Constitutional Proposals\n[] SEP: Governance Proposals\n[x] Other SEPs\n\n## **Proposal details**\n\n## ***Purpose & Background***\nAs part of a larger effort toward economic sustainability, The Safe Ecosystem Foundation (“SEF”) has taken the initiative to orchestrate the first revenue stream for SafeDAO. As part of this, SEF has taken the recently introduced Native Swaps in  Safe{Wallet} as an opportunity to create an alignment of ecosystem products and solutions with the community brand. More specifically, SEF utilizes its Safe-related trademarks to facilitate revenue generation of third-party integrations within Safe{Wallet} via a license model with Native Swaps as the first integration of this kind. It should be particularly emphasized that Safe{Wallet} does not extract any value around Native Swaps. Instead, revenue streams are pledged to SafeDAO. The intention is to give SafeDAO more agency regarding the use of funds. For details around sustainable ecosystem building and the concept of Community-Aligned Fees, see [here](https://safe.global/blog/safedao-community-aligned-fees-introduction).\n\nThis proposal suggests ratifying that SafeDAO accepts the revenue transfer for Native Swaps through the Safe{Wallet} integration.\n\n\n**Fee Conversion and Acceptance of Funds**\nFor Native Swaps, a fee conversion mechanism collects the fees in the assets accepted by CoW Protocol, using the proceeds to buy SAFE tokens on the open market and then (upon ratification) brings them under community control. This means, upon ratification of this proposal, the revenue streams will be transferred to an account which is designated for SafeDAO. As such the SEF or a fully-owned subsidiary serves as the legal wrapper for the revenue streams of the SafeDAO treasury. \n\n**Resource Allocation**\nThe funds received from 3rd parties would be part of SafeDAO’s treasury and as such they can be allocated according to SafeDAO’s governance and resource allocation frameworks (i.e. Outcomes-Based Resource Allocation).\n\n\n## **Annex 1:** \nFee details: \n![SEP 44 Image 1.png](ipfs://bafkreibdyt7vr5oeus2pmdybmseur3j5wbgubxssth4ekh6tnbuk7igjya)\n    \n![SEP 44 Image 2.png](ipfs://bafkreie5hlalafdsy74a6mvour3i46udx6swguauxnpd7zdsh4zbjs66re)\n\n\nFor more details check [Introducing TWAP Orders and Tiered Fees in Safe{Wallet} Native Swaps](https://safe.global/blog/introducing-tiered-fees-and-twap-orders-in-safe-wallet-native-swaps), [How does the widget fee work for native swaps? | Safe{Wallet} Help Center and Support.](https://help.safe.global/en/articles/178530-how-does-the-widget-fee-work-for-native-swaps) and [Cowswap - Partner fee calculation](https://docs.cow.fi/governance/fees/partner-fee#partner-fee-calculation). \n\n\n## ***Effects and Impact Analysis***\nIf the proposal is accepted, the revenue generated from Native Swaps will be allocated to SafeDAO and become part of its treasury. As such it can be allocated according to SafeDAO’s governance and resource allocation. This will be the first income stream for the DAO and allow for a more sustainable resource allocation governed by SafeDAO.\n\nLooking at the generated fees during the first month of Native Swaps and considering a hypothetical stagnant development, this income stream would create an annualized amount of ~$2.5M of community-aligned fees already. However, limiting an assessment to such a conservative view would completely disregard the fact that there are multiple areas for optimization, e.g. raising awareness for the feature and rolling it out to more networks.\n\nIf the proposal is rejected, the revenue generated from Native Swaps will remain under the control of the Safe Ecosystem Foundation. It will be allocated in line with the Foundation's purpose: fostering the Safe ecosystem. However, this revenue will then not form part of the SafeDAO treasury and will not be governed by token holders or SafeDAO delegates.\n\n\n## ***Alternative Solutions***\nAn alternative to the introduction of the community-aligned fees would be not to focus on financial sustainability. \nAnother alternative would be not to have the revenue governed by SafeDAO. \nWe don’t see this as a valid alternatives as this will limit the DAO in its ecosystem funding. \n\n## ***Implementation***\n[x] Own implementation possible\n[] Own implementation but with funding (how much % to implementation)\n[] Request for technical support through Safe matter experts:\n  * Who is needed?\n  * Did you reach out?\n  * Is there a roadmap?\n\nFor the implementation the SEF or a fully-owned subsidiary of SEF under the surveillance of the Foundation Council will operationally set up a wallet attributed to SafeDAO with the same setup as the SafeDAO treasury. \n\n## **Open Questions**\n\nNone\n\n## **Acknowledgements**\nWill be added during the discussion. \n\n## **Copyright**\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via CC0.",

      "content": "Please refer to the [full proposal text on the SafeDAO forum](https://forum.safe.global/t/sep-43-obra-zk-email-account-recovery-zk-email/5387). Some parts may have been removed to fit within the character limit on Snapshot.\n\n## Title: \n[SEP 43][OBRA] ZK Email Account Recovery - ZK Email\n\n### Authors\n- Aayush Gupta (aayushgupta5000@gmail.com, [GitHub: Divide-By-0](https://github.com/Divide-By-0), Telegram: yush_g)\n- John Guilding (Github: JohnGuilding, https://twitter.com/john_guilding)\n- Sora Suegami (suegamisora@gmail.com, [GitHub: sorasue77](https://github.com/sorasue77), Telegram: sorasue)\n- Aditya Bisht (adityabisht64@gmail.com, [GitHub: Bisht13](https://github.com/Bisht13), Telegram: Bisht13)\n\n### Created\n2024-06-17\n\n### Abstract\nThis initiative proposes implementing a secure and efficient account recovery system using the Zk-Email SDK. The recovery method leverages guardian-based email verification, providing a reliable fallback for users who lose access to their accounts. The guide includes the entire setup, configuration, lifecycle management, and integration instructions for digital wallet applications. We will be EIP 7579 compatible, as well as work with legacy Gnosis Safes.\n\n### Proposal Details\n\n#### Purpose and Background\nThe proposal aims to address the critical need for a reliable account recovery mechanism in digital wallet applications. Currently, users who lose access to their wallets face significant difficulties in recovery, leading to loss of funds and user dissatisfaction. This initiative uses guardian-based email verification, leveraging the Zk-Email SDK to create a secure and efficient recovery process, and allow users to use non-chain native users as guardians.\n\nEdit: As of July, we have already created [a working demo](https://prove.email/recovery) of an email recovery module for Safe 1.3 on Base Sepolia. You can follow the [live demo at EthCC here](https://ethcc.io/archive/ZK-Email-Decentralized-Email-Login-Account-Recovery-2FA). We've also begun an audit of [our 7579-compatible module for Safe 1.4+ account recovery](https://github.com/zkemail/email-recovery).\n\n#### Effects and Impact Analysis\n- **Pros**:\n  - Provides a reliable recovery method, reducing the risk of permanent loss of assets\n  - Lets users use non-chain-native users as recovery methods\n  - Allows for very intuitive recovery process via email confirmations\n  - Timelocks for 48 hours to avoid malicious fund stealing\n  - Only relies on decentralized relayer infra with all MIT licensed OSS code, removing dependencies on zk email team\n- **Cons**:\n  - Requires trust in the DKIM keys of the users' email servers\n- **Risks**:\n  - Dependence on email service availability and security\n  - Implementation complexities and potential bugs in the initial rollout\n\n#### Alternative Solutions\nAlternatives like MPC or centralized social recovery were considered. However, these were discarded due to their security risks.\n\n#### Implementation\n- The initiative requires new code development using ZK Email, for both circuits and smart contracts.\n- Security of the code will be ensured through audits by Ackee in Month 1 and Zellic in Month 2, along with concurrent user testing.\n- Deployment across all safes will be completed by Month 3.\n\nFor code, we are doing our own implementation but with funding (how much % to implementation: 100%) -- the implementation is finished as of July 2024 and is blocked on funding for audits.\n\nRegarding requests for technical support through Safe matter experts, we are already in touch with the relevant experts.\n  - Who is needed? Wallet and 7579 folks.\n  - Did you reach out? Yes.\n  - Is there a roadmap? Yes, already communicated with them. Initial implementation complete and available to try at [prove.email/recovery](https://prove.email/recovery).\n\n### Funding Request\n$50,000 USDC\nJuly Edit: The quote came back as $75,000 USDC, but due to community feedback we have kept the original $50K ask.\n\n### Upfront Funding\nIdeally 100% in order to fund audit. Can do in installments of 50% as well.\n\n### Relation to Budget\nThe requested funding represents 25% of the total budget allocated for Strategy 4. It is also eligible for Strategy 5, and Strategy 2 only has 15K left so will not work.\n\n### Metrics and KPIs\n- Number of wallets integrating the recovery system\n- Number of successful account recoveries\n- User satisfaction rating\n- Security incidents reported\n\n### Timeline and Milestones\n- **Month 1**: Finish code, Ackee audit\n- **Month 2**: Testnet deployments, Zellic audit with concurrent user testing\n- **Month 3**: Deployment across all safes\n\n### Initiative Lead\nAayush Gupta (aayushgupta5000@gmail.com, [GitHub: Divide-By-0](https://github.com/Divide-By-0), Telegram: yush_g)\n\nNote that the initiative in question asking for grants here is ZK Email, and PSE/EF are not associated with receiving or asking for any portion of the grant.\n\n### Team\n- **Aayush Gupta** - Steward at ZK Email, has been working on the tech for 1.5 years\n  - Email: aayushgupta5000@gmail.com\n  - GitHub: [Divide-By-0](https://github.com/Divide-By-0)\n  - Telegram: yush_g\n  - Twitter: yush_g\n- **John Guilding** - Lead Smart Contract Dev, working for last 3 months on ZK Email account recovery\n  - Github: JohnGuilding\n  - Twitter: [john_guilding](https://twitter.com/john_guilding)\n- **Sora Suegami** - Cryptography Researcher on ZK Email, working on the tech for 1.5 years\n  - Email: suegamisora@gmail.com\n  - GitHub: [sorasue77](https://github.com/sorasue77)\n  - Telegram: sorasue\n- **Aditya Bisht** - Lead Engineer at ZK Email, has been working for 6 months\n  - Email: adityabisht64@gmail.com\n  - GitHub: [Bisht13](https://github.com/Bisht13)\n  - Telegram: Bisht13\n\n### Additional Support/Resources\nNo additional non-financial resources are requested from the Safe Ecosystem Foundation or core contributors.\n\n### Implementation Dependencies\nNo governance changes.\n\n### Open Questions\n- How will user adoption of the guardian-based recovery system be encouraged?\n- How can we closer collaborate on making the user interface as natively integrated as possible?\n\n### Copyright\nCopyright and related rights waived via CC0.

      "content": "Please refer to the [full proposal text on the SafeDAO forum](https://forum.safe.global/t/draft-obra-simulations-and-report-safings-accounts-and-safe-vaults-kolektivo-labs-hopper-protocol/5621). Some parts may have been removed to fit within the character limit on Snapshot.\n\n## Title: \n[SEP 42] [OBRA] Simulations and Report: Safings Accounts and Safe Vaults - Kolektivo Labs & Hopper Protocol\n\n## Authors: \n@LuukDAO , @Hopper \n\n## Abstract\nThis proposal builds on the outcome from the Safe Token Utility Sprint 1, early data from Safe {Pass}, and the native Swap integration combined with market research by our teams to simulate and describe the potential value of Safings Accounts and Safe Vaults (Vault Marketplace) for the SAFE tokeneconomy.\n\nThe outcome would be a data-driven and tested scope for Safings Accounts and Safe Vaults.\n\n## Aligned Strategy:** \n1. Research and implement Safe token utility\n\n## Funding Request: \n35,000 USDC, split over 12 weeks\n\n## Relation to Strategy budget:** \n35% of the remaining budget (100,000 USDC) - 17.5% of the initial budget (200,000 USDC) as indicated [in the Governance Hub.](https://safe-global.notion.site/Get-funding-from-SafeDAO-ba1e63169d2d4bc08fd50ace9b95f12f)\n\n## Metrics and KPIs\nWe’ll use the following measurements to track the impact of this initiative on the Strategy:\n- Contributions of simulations to progress token utility: A qualitative measure of the relevance of the simulations, judged by Safe delegates' and team members' feedback.\n- Ability of the Report to drive meaningful product development: Measured by the number of reads of the Report thread and total budget allocated to related follow-up proposals in the three Sprints following its publication.\n\n## Initiative Description\nSix high-potential use cases were identified [during the Safe Token Utility Sprint 1](https://forum.safe.global/t/safe-token-utility-sprint-1-output/5505). The [Savings Account](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EJJUzl3UcKEd8ofKeTf4rD2rbGp8jJ5IZsYjoqGN4pE/edit), a simple yield strategy designed for “lazy” or “conservative” Safe users, and [Safe Vaults](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1eVdDkJGGctNnrzRr8dake5y-mrnlqpTYaIWX3e_43Z8/edit) (or Vault Marketplace), a module for asset managers to offer yield strategies to Safe users, were identified as two promising and related use cases.\n\nThe anticipated next step towards realizing these opportunities was to start small pilots for some of these Token Utility Use cases. However, in practice, coordinating such pilots would require a lot of coordination due to technical and financial constraints.\n\nAfter Hopper, a team building vault infrastructure on top of Safe, submitted an initial draft proposal to progress token Utility through research and simulations, the Safe Token Utility team decided to collaborate with them to create this proposal and produce relevant simulations that can predict the potential impact of these two use cases.\n\nThese simulations would be tested against a benchmark produced by our teams and used as input for a report that will clarify the potential impact of these use cases on the Safe ecosystem and the SAFE token economy. The Report should outline strategic considerations and justify follow-up proposals to build out versions of Savings Accounts and Safe Vaults.\n\nThe project should take no more than 3 months to complete, allowing for follow-up proposals to be submitted in Sprint 3 of Season 4.\n\n**Outcomes of this initiative**\n- A series of simulations and tests to determine which type of strategies and YBA are most promising, what potential fees can be incorporated, how Safe {Pass} can help enable, the impact on the SAFE token economy, and what an initial program could look like. The simulations will be benchmarked against our market research conducted in Phase 1.\n\n- A data-driven report of the potential impact of Safings Accounts and Safe Vaults on the SAFE tokeneconomy and a description of the process and estimated investment required to realize the use cases to their full potential.\n\n## Current Status\nThe first Safe Token Utility sprint was completed last month, and the insights gained will be leveraged for this initiative. Hopper has also conducted more than six months of deep market and product research.\n\n## Risks of the Initiative\nBelow are the identified risks and how we mitigate them:\n1. Simulation results not being able to predict future interest correctly: It is possible that the simulation outcomes deviate from the actual adoption post-launch of these features. To increase the simulations' ability to estimate the potential adoption and value to SAFE, we start the initiative with a four-week research and design phase to identify all factors at play and create a benchmark based on existing market players.\n\n2. Risk of blockers stopping feature development even when presented with an estimation of their impact: Even after the publication of the final report, technical or financial constraints may limit the successful rollout of these features. Regardless, a detailed report backed by simulations will justify prioritizing SafeDAO resources to solve these blockers.\n\n## Milestones and Timeline\n\n|Milestone|Description|Duration|\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|1. Research and Design|Complete additional research around Savings Accounts and Vaults to identify the most relevant data points and potential blockers/enablers. We will analyze the most prominent YBA, collateralized fee credits, vault strategies, fee structure, and point systems to create a benchmark against which to compare the tests.|4 Weeks|\n|2. Simulations|Conduct various simulations and tests to determine which type of strategies and YBA are most promising, what potential fees can be incorporated, how Safe {Pass} can help enable, the impact on the SAFE token economy, and what an initial program could look like.|5 Weeks|\n|3. Report Publication|Publish a data-driven report of the potential impact of Safings Accounts and Safe Vaults on the SAFE tokeneconomy and a process and estimate investment required to realize the use cases to their full potential.|3 Weeks|\n\n## Initiative Lead\n[LuukDAO](https://twitter.com/LuukDAO), an existing Safe Delegate, experienced product developer, and founder of [Kolektivo Labs](https://www.kolektivo.co/), will lead the initiative. He will play the role of Product owner and project manager to ensure the timely and successful delivery of the initiative.\n\n**Team**\nLavi (@Lavi): An experienced DeFi analyst/researcher. Lavi previously led projects and teams at Index Coop, Prime Rating, and Llama Risk and was part of the Safe Token Utility Sprint 1 team. He is active in the Digital Asset space in Switzerland and beyond. Lavi brings relevant business and tokenomics experiences and 4+ years of structured DeFi research experience.\n\nRomain Lavernhe (Hopper), a multi-founder in DeFi, has recently launched Amphor.io and Morphous.xyz. Romain will be involved in the research and report-writing phases.\n\nAymeric Lorenzelli (Hopper), Aymeric is the founder of WAGTI.corp and specializes in project analysis. He has been studying tokenomics and governance models for the past two years. He will lead the simulation design and support the writing of the final report.\n\n## Additional Resources\nWhen we run the simulations in October, getting data from the Safe {Pass} and Safe {Wallet} Swap features in October would be helpful.\n\n## Implementation Dependencies\nNo dependencies",

      "title": "[SEP 41] [OBRA] Safe Ecosystem Roundups and Highlights by FinOps3",
      "content": "Please refer to the [full proposal text on the SafeDAO forum](https://forum.safe.global/t/draft-obra-safe-ecosystem-roundups-and-highlights-by-finops3/5609). Some parts may have been removed to fit within the character limit on Snapshot.\n\n## Title: \n[SEP 41] [OBRA] Safe Ecosystem Roundups and Highlights by FinOps3\n\n## Authors: \n@LuukDAO , @JashFi \n\n## Abstract\nThis proposal builds on the foundation created with [FinOps3](https://www.finops3.xyz/) to produce bi-weekly Safe Ecosystem Roundups published on the FinOps3 platform and social media and shared in newsletter format. In addition, 10 highlight campaigns in blog and video format will be produced with Safe Builders and stakeholders to showcase the quality and diversity of solutions built on Safe.\n\n## Aligned Strategy\nStrategy 3: Increase awareness of Safe Ecosystem \n\n## Funding Request:\n25,000\n\nThis proposal will cover the remainder of Season 3 (Sprint 4) and the entirety of Season 4 (Sprint 1-4). A period of approximately five months. \n\n## Relation to Budget: \n35.9% of the remaining budget (69,500 USDC) - 10% of the initial budget (250,000 USDC) as indicated [in the Governance Hub.](https://safe-global.notion.site/Get-funding-from-SafeDAO-ba1e63169d2d4bc08fd50ace9b95f12f) \n\n## Metrics and KPIs:\nThe proposed initiative will impact the following KPIs:\n- Number of reads of bi-weekly ecosystem roundups across all channels (platform, socials, newsletter). \n- Total views and relevant CTA clicks in our highlight articles and platform.\n- Contribution to the overall understanding of the Web3 audience of Safe. \n\n## Initiative Description:\nDuring the creation of FinOps3, it became clear that many Web3 teams and users have an outdated view of Safe. Besides small branding misalignments—many still refer to Safe as \"Gnosis Safe\" or sometimes simply \"Gnosis\"—it is clear that builders and users are still unaware of the vast ecosystem Safe has created. \n\nWe want to change the builder perspective of Safe, and grow the number of users and developers who embed Safe at the center of their onchain toolkit.\n\n**It all starts with Safe.**\n\nOver the past months, we've created the [FinOps3 platform](https://www.finops3.xyz/) with dozens of Safe Ecosystem projects mapped and guides created. This proposal builds on top of that foundation to further enhance the understanding and growth of the Safe ecosystem. \n\n**What we'll produce**\n- At the core are bi-weekly Safe Ecosystem Roundups which will include ecosystem stats, tech updates, feature highlights, ecosystem news, and other timely updates that are relevant for new and existing Safe stakeholders alike. We expect to produce at least 10 of these Roundups, with the positive side effect that we will produce additional content and update our platform while working on these roundups. We learned during the initial FinOps3 application that continuous cycles are better for producing and growing quality content (vs. the \"sprints\" approach we incorporated early on). \n- We'll produce 10 ecosystem highlights (projects/use-cases) in different formats. With FinOps3 we tested blogs and Twitter Spaces, but we haven't identified a winning set-up yet. With this proposal, we aim to iterate on the highlighted format, for example - creating short in-person interviews ([example of what our team did with Worldcoin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-Po0NCTjLI)) or blogs with custom visuals which can be used outside of the context of the specific article (for example a simple sheet cheat of onchain banking options. \n\n## Current Status: \nThe Safe Ecosystem Roundups will leverage the brand and platform of [FinOps3](https://www.finops3.xyz/) to build from. Our existing [solution database](https://www.finops3.xyz/tools) will be expanded further and leveraged to source the best teams for ecosystem highlights. Our existing contribution to SafeDAO and involvement in the wider Web3 space will be leveraged to produce timely and exciting Safe Ecosystem Roundups. \n\n## Timeline and Milestones:\n\n\n|Milestone |Deliverables | Duration: $ Budget|\n|--- | --- | ---|\n|S3 Sprint 4 | Publish at least 2 Safe Ecosystem Roundups. Produce at least 2 Ecosystem Highlights. | 1 month: $5,000|\n|S4 Sprint 1 | Publish at least 2 Safe Ecosystem Roundups. Produce at least 2 Ecosystem Highlights. | 1 month: $5,000|\n|S4 Sprint 2 | Publish at least 2 Safe Ecosystem Roundups. Produce at least 2 Ecosystem Highlights. Produce a mid-term report and iterate on the format. | 1 month: $5,000|\n|S4 Sprint 3 | Publish at least 2 Safe Ecosystem Roundups. Produce at least 2 Ecosystem Highlights. | 1 month: $5,000|\n|S4 Sprint 4 | Publish at least 2 Safe Ecosystem Roundups. Produce at least 2 Ecosystem Highlights. Produce a final report and draft a follow-up proposal based on learnings. | 1 month: $5,000|\n|Total | Publish at least 10 Safe Ecosystem Roundups. Produce at least 10 Ecosystem Highlights. Produce two reports. | 5 months: $25,000|\n\n## Risks:\nThe main risk is the produced content and distribution approach not contributing positively to the overall understanding and adoption of the Safe ecosystem. \nTo reduce this risk, we are taking a more data-driven approach and have incorporated rhythms to ensure we continue to grow, learn and improve over time. \n\n## Initiative Lead:\n[Kolektivo Labs](https://twitter.com/KolektivoLabs)\n\n**Team:**\nThe team working on the Safe Ecosystem Roundups and Highlights will consist of the same team that developed FinOps3: lead [LuukDAO](https://twitter.com/LuukDAO), Analyst and Content [Jash](https://twitter.com/Jashdotfi), and Design, [Enrique](https://twitter.com/webupretu).\n\n## Additional Support/Resources:\n- Example guide from [FinOps3 platform](https://www.finops3.xyz/insights/onchain-governance)\n\n## Implementation Dependencies:\nNo dependencies.",

      "content": "Please refer to the [full proposal text on the SafeDAO forum](https://forum.safe.global/t/draft-governance-cycle-amendments-season-3-sprint-3/5610). Some parts may have been removed to fit within the character limit on Snapshot.\n\n## Title: \n[SEP 40] Governance Cycle Amendments Season 3, Sprint 3\n\n## Authors:\nAmy (Safe, [@amy.sg](https://forum.safe.global/u/amy.sg)), Andre Geest (Safe, [@Andre](https://forum.safe.global/u/andre))\n\n## Created:\n2024-08-12\n\n## Abstract\n\nFollowing our OBRA retro and reassessing governance needs, this proposal suggests the following amendments to the governance cycle structure:\n\n1. **Remove “Phase 0” and start at Phase 1 [Draft] at the beginning of the Governance Cycle/Sprint.** The proposal cycle officially starts with Phase 1. This would give two weeks for Phase 1 proposal review and discussion. Anyone can start a pre-Phase 1 proposal as a regular forum post under the label “Discussion”.\n2. **Introduce a proposal change freeze period:** Proposal changes are frozen by the *Thursday* of Week 2. This ensures open questions/comments are completed in a timely manner and avoids any drastic changes for delegates and guardians signaling.\n3. **Add a reflection period by shorten Voting Period** to Thursday / 9 days (from Monday / 12 days), with the following Friday-Sunday as reflection. The new cycle would start Monday as usual. This gives time to reflect and allow results to settle before starting the next cycle.\n\nA visual of the changes are under “Changes Visualized”.\n\n## Proposal types\n\n[  ] SEP: Constitutional Proposals\n[X] SEP: Governance Proposals\n[  ] Other SEPs\n\n## Proposal details\n\n**Purpose and Background**\n\n**Background**\n\nThank you to everyone who provided feedback in the initial discussion. [An initial discussion was started in this thread.](https://forum.safe.global/t/discussion-amendments-to-governance-cycle-structure/5558)\n\nThrough voter interviews and our [OBRA retro](https://www.notion.so/6d11211bf88843c9b5fb89041d97ea42?pvs=21), in the past 2 Seasons, the governance team observed two actions: First, Guardians, delegates, and the governance team felt there was not enough time to properly review proposals in Phase 1. Secondly, the purpose of Phase 0 was unclear to proposal authors. Formally moving through Phase 0 to Phase 1 caused poor proposal experience. While we have other initiatives in the pipeline to ease these pain points, improving review experience for proposals is the first step.\n\nAt this phase, we wanted more flexibility while introducing as little changes to the governance cycle as possible. This was done through adhering to the initial goals of the cycle: keeping the total cycle length the same and keeping deadlines predictable and memorable (Mondays and Thursdays).\n\n## Framework Change Log Summary\n\n| Original | Change | Reasoning |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| The beginning of the Governance cycle starts with Phase 0 and Phase 1 starts in Week 2. | Phase 1 starts at the beginning of the Governance Cycle/Sprint. Remove \"Phase 0\". Instead, anyone can start a pre-Phase 1 proposal at any time as a regular forum post under the label \"Discussion.\" | This would give two weeks for Phase 1 review and discussion and reduce confusion about \"Phase 0\". |\n| No proposal freeze period. | Proposal changes are not allowed (“frozen” state) after the Thursday 23:59 UTC of Week 2. | This ensures open questions/comments are completed in a timely manner and avoids any drastic changes for delegates and guardians signaling. |\n| Voting period is 12 days and ends Monday/on the same day as the first day of a new Governance cycle. | Add a reflection period by shorting Voting Period to Friday / 9 days, with the following Friday - Sunday as the reflection period. Update the Snapshot Space voting length from 12 to 9 days. The new cycle starts Monday as usual. | This gives time for results to settle before starting the next cycle. |\n\nThe proposal will go into effect in the immediate cycle following the ratification.\n\n## “Changes Visualized”\n\n**Before**\n![1_Changes Visualized Before.jpg](ipfs://bafkreig7tnantq5n4dcrs3h2kpe4qncsr7n2tngmhpbekflun7pczpqmb4)\n    \n\n**After**\n![2_Changes Visualized After.jpg](ipfs://bafkreifp6rduszaua5mgf7kz67wlrw27s7vu6cq2bddp2tjy5hs2hz6hee)\n    \n\n**Smaller informal changes:**\n\n- With this amendment, Guardians can signal as early as the start of the governance cycle (Phase 1) until the Phase 1 signal deadline. Guardians can also withdraw their signal at any time if there are changes beyond their original signal.\n- Proposers no longer need to create separate forum posts to move into Phase 1.\n- No matter what phase, changes to the proposal must always be logged and shared as a comment on the proposal thread for visibility.\n- Proposals with integrations/dependencies on Wallet and Core require explicit sign-off on the forum from a member of the Safe Wallet and Core team. Defined as “Sign-Off” (Approved to move forward), “Request for Modification” (requested changes that once implemented, would allow the teams to sign off. However, a clear/viable option from the author must be presented, otherwise can move to a Block), or “Block” (Proposal is unable to move forward due to legal, technical, not inline with the goals/objectives of Wallet/Core, or other reasons).\n\n## Changes to the Governance Framework\n\n**Original**\n\n**E.

Introducing a new deadline may also mean 2 more notifications (Freeze Period and Reflection Period) to signal deadlines.\n\nChanges can introduce the following risks:\n\n**Scenario 1:** Voters are not aware of the new cycle and creates confusion during the next voting cycle.\n\n**Mitigation:** The only change for voters is the new deadline of Thursday instead of Monday. The amendment proposal was submitted earlier in Discussion phase to increase visibility and awareness. Additionally, the amendment will be proposed and discussed in the Governance Call prior to voting to maximize awareness. In the following weeks before and after the amendment goes into effect, there will be additional communication on telegram, twitter, and forum to remind voters of the new voting cycle.\n\n## Alternative Solutions\n\nWe considered a few alternatives:\n\n1. **Option 1: Break up the suggested amendments into separate proposals and deploy updates incrementally.**\n    \n    This option could be feasible, however incremental changes to timelines could cause more confusion, so we opted to create smaller changes that would maximize impact.\n    \n2. **Option 2: Increase Reflection Period time.**\n    \n    This option can be possible in the future. While there were valid points to [having a longer reflection period](https://forum.safe.global/t/discussion-amendments-to-governance-cycle-structure/5558/7), increasing the Reflection Period would require shifting the voting period and/or total cycle length. At this moment, we did not find enough friction to create a larger shift.\n    \n3. **Option 3: Keep cycle as is.**\n    \n    We considered this option, therefore we kept the cycle for a few sprints before suggesting an amendment.\n    \n\n## Implementation\n\n[  ] Own implementation possible\n[  ] Own implementation but with funding (how much % to implementation)\n[X] Request for technical support through Safe matter experts\n- Requires updating the Snapshot strategy to reduce the voting period time\n\n## Open Questions\n\n- Given the timing of the cycle, how might we formalize an ample amount of time for Core and Wallet teams to provide a sign-off?

Some parts may have been removed to fit within the character limit on Snapshot.\n\n## Title: \n[SEP 39] [OBRA] Public API Development and Continuation of SafeDAO Governance Analytics Dashboard Services - Curia\n\n## Authors:\n@v3naru\n\n## Created:\n2024-08-12\n\n## Abstract\n**Abstract:**  \nThis proposal seeks to extend the [SafeDAO Governance Analytics Dashboard](https://safedao.curiahub.xyz/participation) for an additional six months. The continued operation of this [service](https://forum.safe.global/t/sep-12-obra-safedao-governance-analytics-dashboard-services-curia/4680) will ensure uninterrupted access to governance insights and analytics, fostering data-driven decision-making within the SafeDAO ecosystem. The extension will build on the current infrastructure, incorporating community feedback and any governance changes, such as the upcoming split delegation. After working closely with the Safe Foundation team, we identified a growing demand for the data in API format, as requested by Safe governance team. To meet this demand, we propose expanding our services to include an API, allowing other platforms and third parties to access and utilize the dashboard's data. The monthly governance analytics reports will remain a central feature, providing accessible insights into voting patterns, participation, and proposal dynamics.\n\n## Aligned Strategy:\nWildcard\n\n## Funding Request:  \n$50,000 USD to support the working team, infrastructure costs, and the development of public API & monthly governance analytics reports from October 2024 to March 2025 (6 months).\n\n**Infrastructure Costs:**  \n$9,000 USD for 6 months at $1,500 per month, exclusively allocated for operating the SafeDAO Governance Analytics Dashboard.\n\n**Team Costs:**  \n- **Project Manager (PM):** $10,000 USD (154 hours @ $65/hour)  \n- **Engineers (2):** $19,980 USD total ($9,990/engineer; 111 hours/engineer @ $90/hour)  \n- **Governance Data Analyst:** $7,980 USD (114 hours @ $70/hour)  \n- **Contingency and On-demand Resources:** $3,040 USD (Fixed amount for unforeseen expenses)\n\n## Relation to Budget:  \n50% of the remaining budget on Wildcard Strategy\n\n## Metrics and KPIs:\n- Number of Monthly Visitors  \n- Number Link Clicks to Voting Portal  \n- Number Mentions & References from Delegates and forums  \n- Number of API Requests\n\n## Initiative Description:\nThis extension will maintain and enhance the SafeDAO Governance Analytics Dashboard, continuing the focus on producing insightful monthly reports. The dashboard will cover ongoing infrastructure costs, respond to community feedback, and adapt to any governance updates. A significant addition will be the development of an API that allows other platforms and third parties to integrate with the dashboard's data. This decision stems from our collaboration with the Safe Foundation team, where we recognized a strong demand for API access to governance data. Expanding this capability will broaden the utility and impact of the analytics, enabling more stakeholders to leverage the insights in various contexts.\n\n**Monthly Reporting:**  \nThe continuation of monthly reporting will include:\n\n- **Data Interpretation and Analysis:** Ongoing analysis to transform complex metrics into understandable insights, with a focus on trends, patterns, and anomalies.\n- **Focus on Key Governance Metrics:** Detailed reports covering voting patterns, delegate performance, proposal outcomes, and shifts in voting power distribution.\n- **Actionable Insights:** Continued emphasis on providing recommendations based on the data, including areas for improvement in participation and governance practices.\n- **Customized Content Based on Community Feedback:** Reports will remain responsive to the interests and needs of the SafeDAO community.\n- **Visual Data Representation:** Continued use of charts, graphs, and infographics to make data accessible.\n- **Historical Context and Comparative Analysis:** Ongoing contextualization of data within the broader governance landscape, including comparisons with other DAOs where relevant.\n\n## Current Status:  \nThe SafeDAO Governance Analytics Dashboard is fully operational, providing essential services to the SafeDAO community. Key features include:\n\n\nTracking of votable supply within SafeDAO\n![Curia 1.png](ipfs://bafkreifzvqdas4fvtsxnkfxmolqd4hsh4gkgofsyxwrxl6rre4yywfpfom)\n    \n\nVisualization and analysis of proposal activities\n![Curia 2.png](ipfs://bafybeih73peyhk2z3g7arhwilztof555fc757ibbmf2z3g7clfbwji3d2m)\n    \n\nIn-depth view of voting power distribution\n![Curia 3.png](ipfs://bafkreigh23sf3vt67h4zfaiek4mhqtkht523ea5cssgsv4du5nesx52naq)\n![Curia 4.png](ipfs://bafkreidwyppb7zxycb47tjroh5pu7jiuqedcjt5pamcldwpushexetfe5e)\n    \n\nDetailed participation metrics\n![Curia 5.png](ipfs://bafkreib6ydaywwvf7eb3ejjrgylk2p7aecaetffkfyjarpcdphm4jy2pnq)\n![Curia 6.png](ipfs://bafkreiehiskmrpwbkhbwuyjycdjgbpmiyqjckmfi6sknopi2vppouxzipq)\n\nComprehensive delegate profiles & Delegation UI for Safe token holders\n![Curia 7.png](ipfs://bafybeifgm5i7zfw6socc5fkotl5dxkp4h4dz2qa6qk3j3x5m3iqsvdyiba)\n![Curia 8.png](ipfs://bafybeidioo5oxoyhohrfsoqj5e3g22h6ncrp6i7twqtftnow5uqyyx66fa)    \n\n\nVoting behavior analysis\n![Curia 9.png](ipfs://bafkreid7zurwx2csjnzb253hhfsbc77mnxurtirmaphxpl3lrsrzndg4om)\n\n\n\nIn addition, our ongoing commitment to transparency and accountability is reflected in our previous reports, such as SafeDAO Governance Analytics Report, which can be accessed on the SafeDAO forum thread [here](https://forum.safe.global/t/safedao-governance-analytics-report-thread/5283).

Since then, we have engaged with key stakeholders, gathering feedback to refine our approach and devise a more robust engagement plan. This revised proposal addresses key areas for improvement and aims to further support governance operations and deepen community engagement. Our focus is on positively impacting key metrics such as voter turnout, abstention rates, and the number of individual voters\n\nStableLab proposes a comprehensive strategy to boost governance participation within SafeDAO, focusing on regular governance updates and interactive community engagement initiatives.\n\n### Aligned strategy: Which pre-approved strategy is this initiative driving forward?\n\n[Strategy 5][ Increase governance participation](https://safe-global.notion.site/Strategy-5-Increase-governance-participation-ef04d3b16a7948698b2043014f150ef8).\n\n### Funding request: What resources are being requested from SafeDAO in USDC?\n\n35,000 USDC.\n\nWe aim to engage with SafeDAO on a “Seasonal Fee” basis. The fee specified above will cover\n\nthe remainder of Season 3 (Sprint 3-4), and the entirety of Season 4 (Sprint 1-4).\n\n### If applicable, upfront funding: Indicate if upfront funding is needed. Refer to 'Payout’ under[ Get funding from SafeDAO](https://www.notion.so/Get-funding-from-SafeDAO-ba1e63169d2d4bc08fd50ace9b95f12f?pvs=21) for lump sum payment options\n\nNot applicable.\n\n### Relation to budget: State the requested funding as a percentage of the total initiative budget (e.g. if you ask for 50k for Strategy 1: 25%)\n\nThe funding request represents 35% of the total initiative budget (Strategy 5 now has a total budget of $100k after the latest [Budget Amendment](https://snapshot.org/#/safe.eth/proposal/0x4c30e55cdb09f492116192b3a1ac5f735f77252fbcbcdc7cfdb54f8962efd484)).\n\n### Metrics and KPIs: Which metrics and KPIs will the initiative be measured against?\n\nThe proposed initiative will impact the following KPIs:\n\n* Amount of individual voters: By making SafeDAO governance more accessible through frequent updates, summaries, and digests, we aim to increase the number of individual voters who feel empowered and informed enough to contribute to decision-making processes in the DAO.\n* Growth in high-quality governance proposals: Increased community input and awareness will result in more high-quality governance proposals.\n* Reduction in abstention rates: Demonstrating enhanced community commitment and understanding through decreased abstention rates in SafeDAO votes.\n\n### Initiative Description: What is the initiative about?\n\nOur grant proposal aims to optimize SafeDAO's governance processes and deepen engagement within the DAO. Our objectives and approach include:\n\n* Boosting Community Engagement and Trust:\n  * Address information asymmetry and low stakeholder engagement by providing more frequent and detailed community updates on governance and ecosystem activities including proposal summaries, digests, community call notes, event reminders, etc.\n  * Onboarding Support:\n\n* Monthly Welcome Calls: Host regular onboarding sessions tailored for both new and existing community members.

      "content": "Please refer to the [full proposal text on the SafeDAO forum](https://forum.safe.global/t/draft-contribution-efficiency-system-ces-extension-areta/5586). Some parts may have been removed to fit within the character limit on Snapshot.\n\n## Title: \n[SEP 37] Contribution Efficiency System (CES) Extension - Areta\n\n## Authors:\n@fin_areta\n\n## Created:\n2024-08-09\n\n## Abstract\n> *Provide a brief summary of your initiative*\n> \n\nThe first iteration of the Contribution Efficiency System (CES) operated for 4 months, enabling the A-Z OBRA processes for initiatives and facilitating more efficient decision-making for Safe token holders. Within that time, the operating team from Areta designed and implemented the initial infrastructure, managed the onboarding through reporting of initiatives, and conducted feedback research and learnings culminated in this [OBRA/CES Review Report](https://forum.safe.global/t/contribution-efficiency-system-ces-review-report/5585). \n\nThis proposal calls for an extension of the CES to maintain continuity for new and past OBRA initiatives during this transitional period as OBRA moves towards organizational restructuring. \n\n## Aligned Strategy\n\n> *Provide a brief summary of your initiative*\n> \n\nStrategy 5: Increase governance participation \n\n## Funding Request\n\n> *What resources are being requested from SafeDAO in USDC?*\n> \n\n$35,000 USDC \n\nReduced pricing that reflects the decreased one-time cost for setting up the program and onboarding. It also includes compensation for the two-week funding gap between the end of the current period and the extension.\n\n## Relation to Budget\n\n> *State the requested funding as a percentage of the total initiative budget and remaining (e.g. if you ask for 50k for Strategy 1: 25%)*\n> \n\nTotal Budget: 23%, Remaining Budget: 63%\n\n## Metrics and KPIs\n\n> *Which metrics and KPIs will the initiative be measured against?*\n> \n\nThe KPIs for our initiative have progressed slightly from our initial proposal to emphasize the focus on optimized operations of CES. Find key KPIs below:\n\n1. Overall CES Onboarding and MS-setting takes 30 mins [Onboarding & Milestone Setting]\n2. 90% of OBRA initiatives give updates on time [Tracking]\n3. Quality via Stakeholder Feedback is >8/10 across CES [Holistic Assessment]\n    1. Sub-KPI: Reporting & Reviews are rated >8/10 by delegates and community\n    2. Sub-KPI: Communication & Responsiveness of CES team is rated >8/10 by delegates and community\n    3. Sub-KPI: OBRA/CES Outcome report is rated >8/10 by delegates and community\n4. CES meaningfully supports set-up of OBRA 2.0 [OBRA 2.0 Support]\n\n## Initiative Description\n\n> *What is the initiative about?*\n> \n\nSince the CES’s inception in January of 2024, operations over the first two full OBRA seasons until today have generated significant learnings, both for us as an initiative and more broadly for OBRA. \n\nThroughout the past ~4 months, the CES team worked closely with the Safe Governance team to ensure the seamless initiation of the program, and our facilitation of OBRAs goals through our operations. While not perfect and largely driven by manual operation this resulted in enabling the OBRA initiatives to perform at their best while providing tracking capabilities and an accountability layer to the Safe DAO.  CES has received positive feedback from Guardians, OBRA initiatives, and Safe Governance team alike and thus was requested to continue its operation for a short-term to bridge the gap to a larger OBRA revamp. \n\nIn summary, through this proposal the CES aims to continue operations to:\n\n- Maintain support for the entire life cycle of OBRA initiatives\n- Organize and lead token-holder interaction points\n- Provide quality comprehensive reporting on OBRA initiatives to the DAO\n- Initiative OBRA troubleshooting and program support\n- Maintain OBRA and initiative updates via [CES Notion Hub ](https://buttoned-larch-147.notion.site/OBRA-Contribution-Efficiency-System-250121dc67dd4574a39308199eccc328?pvs=4)\n- Further improvement of the next generation of OBRA\n\n## Current Status:\n\n> *Does the offering (product/service) already exist or is the funding used to create it?*\n> \n\nThe Contribution Efficiency System was initially voted upon and funded as an OBRA proposal in January 2024. Since then the CES has helped onboard and align 12 OBRA initiatives, including offboarding 3 completed initiatives. As a layer in the OBRA process, we have become intimately familiar with the OBRA process, including the different requirements of each set of OBRA stakeholders. With this proposal, we hope to continue our support for these OBRA initiatives, and more broadly, the Safe ecosystem, while enabling the DAO to progress to a revised, more advanced OBRA program in the future. \n\n## Risks:\n\n> *What risks does the initiative entail?*\n> \n\nAs with the first iteration of the CES, the primary risk of this initiative remains that improper execution could add an additional layer of confusion rather than facilitate the intended outcomes. However, given the existing execution without issue across similar lines and this extension proposal to continue, not add, operations to the program this risk is minimal.\n\n## Timeline & Milestones:\n\n> *Provide a detailed timeline or roadmap, include key milestones*\n> \n\n| Timeline                | Focus                                   | USDC  | Deliverables                                                                                                                                           |\n|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------|-------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 3 1/2 Months (Concurrent) | Operational Management & Continuity    | 25,000 | Continue executing operational onboarding, milestone-setting, tracking, and reporting outcomes for the DAO                                                                                      |\n| 3 Weeks                 | Feedback Gathering                      | 5,000 | 1.

(individual or organization)*\n> \n\n[Areta Governance](http://areta.io/) specializes in helping foundations and DAOs establish and grow decentralized governance structures. We develop tailored solutions in governance inception and optimization, ecosystem growth, and service provider selection. Our connected investment bank with deep strategic expertise, enables us to serve our partners holistically, rather than working in isolated governance silos. In this instance, we have had the privilege to work alongside industry leaders such as Uniswap, Arbitrum, Aave, and dYdX.\n\nWe have been very actively involved in SafeDAO’s governance, including co-authoring and contributing to significant OBRA proposals ([Link](https://forum.safe.global/t/sep-10-obra-strategies-and-budget/4459), [Link](https://forum.safe.global/t/sep-9-stablecoin-allocation/4458)), shaping the last token transferability milestones (OBRA and Token Utility), had many interactions with Guardians on- and offline, and see ourselves as long-term supporters of the ecosystem.\n\n\n\nAs before, we intend to work in a team-based approach for CES2.0. For the project duration, Areta will staff a team, including a part-time manager who will oversee an execution associate. We also have the capability to pull in additional associate/research resources if needed at no extra costs to the DAO.",

      "title": "[SEP 36]: [OBRA] - Simulations/Demos and Tidbits for All Safe Use Cases",
      "content": "Please refer to the [full proposal text on the SafeDAO forum](https://forum.safe.global/t/sep-36-obra-strategy-3-simulations-demos-and-tidbits-for-all-safe-use-cases/5489). Some parts may have been removed to fit within the character limit on Snapshot.\n\n## Title: \n[SEP 36]: [OBRA] - Simulations/Demos and Tidbits for All Safe Use Cases\n\n## Authors:\n@DoDAO\n\n## Created:\n2024-07-11\n\n## **Abstract**\nWe propose creating a \"Tidbits Site\" which will have series of simulations (clickable demos, e.g., [Uniswap University Clickable Demos](https://uniswap.university/clickable-demos)) and Tidbits (one-minute reads, e.g., [Compound Education Tidbits](https://compound.education/tidbit-collection-categories)) for all Safe use cases. We will cover three categories:\n\n1) Safe for DAOs\n2) Safe for Teams\n3) Safe for Individuals\n\nDespite many people knowing about the Safe wallet, they often find it difficult to use due to its complex learning curve. Both Clickable Demos and Tidbits will help make the Safe wallet easier to understand and use, improving its adoption.\n\n\n# Funding request\n$24,000\n\n# Aligned strategy\n[Strategy 3] Increase awareness of Safe Ecosystem\n\n# Relation to budget\n9.6% of the total budget for Strategy 3\n\n\n# Metrics and KPIs\n1. Clickable demos for at least 12-18 use cases of Safe, with a quality of at least 8/10.\n2. Tidbits - At least 25-30, with a quality of at least 8/10.\n\n# Initiative description\nAnyone involved in the Ethereum ecosystem for a few months is likely familiar with Safe's name and the significant amount of funds managed through it. Thus, initial awareness is not a major challenge for Safe. However, due to its complexity for new users, the actual usage is much lower than it could be.\n\nSafety is essential for DAOs (Decentralized Autonomous Organizations) and teams, and it's also beneficial for individual users. Each team has its own way of using it, making it difficult to grasp all possible applications. We aim to simplify Safe for the following three types of users and help them understand and use Safe effectively:\n1. Individuals who know about Ethereum but have not yet used any multi-sig or have not used Safe.\n2. Teams (two or more individuals) who plan to use Safe as a multi-sig for coordinated transactions.\n3. DAOs planning to use Safe for various workflows. (We also need to research these exact use cases.)\n\nTo achieve this, we propose creating a series of simulations (clickable demos) and short informative pieces (tidbits) covering all Safe use cases. We will focus on three categories:\n1. Safe for Individuals\n4. Safe for DAOs\n5. Safe for Teams\n\n### Simulation (Clickable Demos)\nInteracting with a Web3 app is not the same as using a traditional web app. Each action can incur transaction fees (gas) and has security implications, which deters many from exploring different uses of Safe.\n\nSafe's flexibility and customizability add to its complexity. Modules and apps increase this complexity further.\n\nSimulations, or clickable demos, provide a risk-free environment to experiment with various use cases. Users can follow steps and learn how to utilize Safe for different purposes.\n\nWe have previously created clickable demos for Uniswap, Compound, Arbitrum, Optimism, and other projects.\n\nExamples:\n- Uniswap University - Clickable Demos - https://uniswap.university/clickable-demos\n- Compound Education - Clickable Demos - https://compound.education/clickable-demos\n\nWe plan to create at least 4-6 clickable demos for each category, totalling approximately 12-18 demos.\n\n### Tidbits\nTidbits are short, one-minute reads designed to explain a concept or a use case quickly. This format was developed after nearly two years of educational efforts and about eight revisions of various formats. Tidbits allow us to cover the entire project in 15-20 minutes, a task that would normally take hours with traditional documentation.\n\nHere are some examples:\n- Compound Education - Tidbits - https://compound.education/tidbit-collection-categories\n- Arbitrum Education - Tidbits - https://arbitrum.education/tidbit-collections\n- Uniswap University - Tidbits - https://uniswap.university/tidbit-collections\n\nWe will create at least 10 tidbits for each category, resulting in around 30 tidbits in total.\n\n# Current status\nOur core platform exists which is already being used for top projects. However the simulations and tidbits for Safe\nwill be created from scratch.\n\n# Risks\nWe don't foresee any risks in this initiative.\n\n# Timeline and Milestones \nWe estimate this initiative will take 7-8 weeks to complete.\n\n- First 4 weeks: Research and study\n- Next 2 weeks: Creation of clickable demos(50%)\n- Next 2 weeks: Creation of tidbits(remaining 50%)\n\n# Initiative lead\nOrganization: DoDAO\n\n# Team:\nDoDAO Team\n\nDoDAO has been working on many tooling and educational initiatives in the blockchain space. We have been working with some of the top projects in the space and have been contributing to the ecosystem in various ways. We have been working on\n\n**Governance Tooling Initiatives**\n- Onchain Governance Proposal Analyzer for Compound (Done) - [Link](https://github.com/RobinNagpal/compound-seatbelt)\n- Command Line Interface code generation POC for Compound's Governance (Done) - [Link](https://github.com/RobinNagpal/compound-proposals)\n- Asset Analysis Dashboards(In Progress)\n- Uniswap's V4 Technical Documentation (Done) -  [Link](https://docs.uniswap.org/contracts/v4/concepts/intro-to-v4)\n\n**Educational Initiatives**\n- https://uniswap.university/\n- https://arbitrum.education/\n- https://compound.education/\n- https://optimism.university/\n- Alchemix Academy (In Progress)\n\n**DoDAO's Products**\n- Academy Site Builder\n- Tidbits Hub(Tidbits & Clickable-Demos/Simulations)\n\nWe take a team based approach and for this initiative we will be working with a team of 1 full-time researcher and 1 full-time developer for a period of 7-8 weeks.\n\nOnce approved, we can share the exact team members who will be working on this initiative.\n\n# Implementation dependencies\nNone\n\n# Notes\nFor any major updates to the UI, we will update the simulations for the next 12 months.\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via CC0.\n\n# Other information\nWe did include the same proposal in the last sprint also, but didn't get a clear \"yeh\" or \"neh\" from any of the delegates or guardians.\nhttps://forum.safe.global/t/draft-orba-strategy-3-simulations-clickable-demos-and-tidbits-for-all-safe-use-cases/5367\n\nWe has also submitted another proposal in the last sprint for [\"[DRAFT] [OBRA, Strategy 4] Safe Tech Stack Decentralization Framework \"](https://forum.safe.global/t/draft-obra-strategy-4-safe-tech-stack-decentralization-framework/5357). We are not re-submitting the proposal until we have a detailed conversation with one of the core devs as this proposal needs close coordination. \n\n# Updates from conversations\n\n### Conversations with @Denham (last sprint - June 21, 2024)\nWe had a chat with @Denham last sprint, and we think he likes the concept and the proposal, but was unsure about the \"cost.\" He also had questions about the stats/engagement on past work, and we have updated the proposal with that information.\n\nWe didn't get a clear \"yes\" or \"no\" from him. We can definitely try to adjust the cost a bit, but we believe our effort is fairly priced. We are currently working with Alchemix, and if you want, we can get a reference from them regarding the amount of detail and effort we put into these sites.\n\n### Conversation with @Malik_ElBay  - July 15, 2024\nToday we had a conversation with @Malik_ElBay and here were some key discussion points\n\n1. The Distribution Mode - Explained Malik that this will be a separate tidbits site similar to the ones we had created for other projects. I have updated the proposal - Done\n2. Outreach effort and coordination - Malik recommended connected with marketing team of Safe to ensure that this is not an isolated effort, which we develop but is not used. We completely agree with the feedback and will reach our to the marketing members in Safe.\n3. Include links to past proposals - Done\n4. \"Everyone -> Be specific\"  - Done\n5. Links to dev projects - Added in proposal - Done\n\n@LuukDAO also shared great feedback on the last proposal, but we were unable to get a meeting with him in the last sprint.\n\nHe provided feedback regarding the change in the Safe UI, and we have included a commitment to update the simulations for any changes in the UI for the next year.\n\nBreaking this into smaller efforts—It's a great suggestion; however, there are a lot of fixed costs (homework, research, preparation) required to deliver high-quality work. Dividing the project into smaller chunks would put us in a highly unfavorable situation.\n\n# Safe Team\nTagging some of the safe members who have been working in community or marketing efforts so that we can get their feedback\n@Jorge-Safe  @lorny @Andre \n\n\nAgain thanks to all the delegates and guardians who connected with us and shared this valuable feedback. Definitely it helped improve the proposal.",

Some parts may have been removed to fit within the character limit on Snapshot.\n\n## Title: \n[SEP 35] [OBRA] Improve voting UI/UX with SAFE on mobile\n\n\n## Authors:\n@1a35e1\n\n## Created:\n2024-07-05\n\n## **Abstract**\n\n2. **Abstract**: Provide a brief summary of your initiative\n\nIn most governance systems, voters elect to place their governance tokens in a SAFE. This is especially true for delegates who sit across multiple governance projects.\n\nRegardless of the underlying governance system (Snapshot, Agora, Tally, OZ Governor) collecting these signatures is a well known time sink and has been further evidenced in our ongoing user research.\n\n3. **Aligned strategy**: Which pre-approved strategy is this initiative driving forward?\n\n\\[Strategy 5] [Increase governance participation](https://safe-global.notion.site/Strategy-5-Increase-governance-participation-ef04d3b16a7948698b2043014f150ef8) \n\n4. **Funding request**: What resources are being requested from SafeDAO in USDC?\n\n- \\~5-8k design UX sprint (1-2week)\n- \\~10-15k implementation (4-6 weeks)\n- \\~5k testing and iteration (1-2 weeks)\n\nTotal request (Lower Bound): 20k\nTotal request (Upper Bound): 28k — Ideally\n\nHowever, any grant amount between these ranges would be sufficient.    \n\n5. **If applicable, upfront funding**: Indicate if upfront funding is needed. Refer to 'Payout’ under[ Get funding from SafeDAO](https://www.notion.so/Get-funding-from-SafeDAO-ba1e63169d2d4bc08fd50ace9b95f12f?pvs=21) for lump sum payment options.\n\nN/A\n\n6. **Relation to budget**: State the requested funding as a percentage of the total initiative budget (e.g. if you ask for 50k for Strategy 1: 25%)\n\n18%\n\n7. **Metrics and KPIs:** Which metrics and KPIs will the initiative be measured against?\n\n- Lead time from Proposal → Cancellation/Execution\n\n  - Eg. It may take 15 hrs to collect and execute a transaction\n\n  - Our system may reduce that time to 1-2 hrs.\n\n- It would be great to get current stats on this from the SAFE team so we can benchmark impact over time.\n\n8. **Initiative description**: What is the initiative about?\n\nBy making SAFEs easier to use from a native mobile interface. We promote stronger security models. For standard SAFE/s (3/5, 5/7, etc) this dramatically increases the possibility of a signer, being aware they need to act on a transaction.\n\nWe propose to leverage the SAFE SDKs to expedite proposing, collecting and executing transactions within the governance domain.\n\nThis will be delivered via our flagship product https\\://lighthouse.cx which is live and available on both (iOS/Android)- \n\nThis is also an R\\&D experiment in designing how to collect signatures on mobile devices.\n\n```\nExample flow:\n* A new Proposal is submitted on-chain from Optimism.\n* All recipients following Optimism will be notified\n* Any voter on the SAFE may propose their choice (eg. 3/5)\n* Other 4 signers may choose to sign\n* After x mins/hours (configurable) a reminder is sent to sign to non-signers\n* Based on thresholds, execute/reject txn can be committed.\n```\n\n_Potential tailwinds_\n\nThis eventually could also extend to treasury execution, we are working with Metagov to explore how we can index treasuries with DAO spaces.\n\n9. **Current status**: Does the offering (product/service) already exist or is the funding used to create it?\n\n- Our product Lighthouse already exists on both (iOS/Android)\n\n- Many of our users are requesting SAFE support however we do not have the funds currently to build out this initiative. \n\n10. **Risks**: What risks does the initiative entail?\n\n- Our application relies heavily on wallet connect at the moment (as do most apps)\n\n- We still need to add Ledger support and other wallets.- \n\n  - This is a known **unknown** and will require iteration.\n\n- This will be a brand new UI/UX experience never done before, so it will require some iteration. However we are confident in delivering an MVP that is usable.\n\n11. **Timeline and milestones**: Provide a detailed timeline or roadmap, include key milestones\n\n- Design UX sprint (1-2 weeks)\n- UX, Messaging and Prototyping\n- Implementation (4-6 weeks)\n  - Vote using SAFE in app with snapshot based DAOs\n  - Vote using SAFE in app with 1-2 Governor based DAOs (eg. Optimism, Nouns)\n- Testing and iteration (1-2 weeks)\n\n  - Community feedback and polishing where possible\n\n12. **Initiative lead:** Who is the accountable initiative lead? (individual or organization)\n\nArnold Almeida, Founder, CTO - <https://lighthouse.cx>\n\n13. **Team**: How many individuals in total will be working on this initiative and what role do they have? Please provide a brief background of the team members, highlighting their relevant experience and expertise\n\n![SEP 35 Image 1.jpeg](ipfs://bafkreib3i47llvjf7sxqzcmm5n6rthdk262k2bftshbxlq3pwbtqrqgaeq)\n\n14. **Additional support/resources**: Are there any resources (non-financial) requested from the Safe Ecosystem Foundation or the core contributors?\n\n- I don’t believe so. We will be for the most part leveraging SAFE SDK’s\n- We may request SDK enhancements though our discovery phase.\n- We may request validation from the SAFE team to field test our UX \n- Explore Indexing options available to us\n- Improving SDKs if necessary\n\n15. **Implementation dependencies:** Does the implementation of this initiative require any prior changes in the current governance processes, e.g., updates to the governance framework, or have any other dependency? If yes, please specify these. _Note that the funding of the initiative will be dependent on the approval and (if needed) successful implementation of such necessary governance modifications or any other dependency._\n\nNo, This would be a value-added addition to voting systems.\n\nGoogle Doc here — https://docs.google.com/document/d/1u_q842Vus09VuVgLJDv4CAvLFUxzsOpAeDHlh1yODsU/edit?usp=sharing\n\nEDITS:\n1.

Some parts may have been removed to fit within the character limit on Snapshot.\n\n## Title: \n[SEP 34][OBRA] Resource Lock Module - Cometh & Gnosis Guild & OneBalance\n\n\n## Authors:\n@Ankit_Chiplunkar\n\n## Created:\n2024-07-04\n\n## **Abstract**\n\nThe Ethereum network transitioned to a rollup-centric roadmap in 2020. This has resulted in an abundance of blockspace, but has resulted in a broken cross-chain UX. Users today have to either wait 10s of minutes or pay 10s of dollars to execute a cross-chain transaction. \n\nThis proposal is to develop a new module on top of SAFEs which makes cross-chain interactions instantaneous. This module enables [resource locks](https://ethresear.ch/t/introducing-onebalance/19557) in SAFEs and removing cross-chain friction.\n\n## **Aligned strategy**\n\n```markdown\nWhich pre-approved strategy is this initiative driving forward?\n```\n\nStrategy 2: Foster Module Ecosystem\n\n## **Funding request**\n\n```markdown\nWhat resources are being requested from SafeDAO in USDC?\n```\n\n75k USDC\n\n### **If applicable, upfront funding**\n\n```markdown\nIndicate if upfront funding is needed.

Increase in cross-chain SAFEs with Resource Lock Mod enabled.\n2. Increase in TVL in Safes with Resource Lock Mod enabled\n3. Increase in Total number of Safes with Resource Lock enabled\n4. Increase in developer engagement with Resource Locks\n5. Increase in network penetration of SAFE (total number of networks where SAFE is used)\n\n## **Initiative description**\n\n```markdown\nWhat is the initiative about?\n```\n\nThe Ethereum network has adopted the rollup centric landscape for scaling itself. Although this has resulted in abundance of blockspace (we can one click deploy a new L2 using RAAS) cross-chain UX is the bottleneck now. Gone are the days of the last DeFi summer when everyone was experimenting with blockchains at scale and retail interaction with EVMs were seamless. \n\nAn Ethereum user today needs to hold balances in different EVM chains, spend 10s of dollars or 10s of minutes moving those balances to a target chain and perform the action that they want to do. Causing significant drop-off or migration of retail users to the Solana ecosystem. \n\nA cross-chain interaction today comprises of three core steps. \n\n1. **Input transaction on origin chain:** The user locks their state and makes a request in an escrow contract or pings the bridge contract on the origin chain.\n2. **Waiting for finality of the input transaction:** A trusted third party either a L1→L2 bridge (Optimism Bridge, Arbitrum bridge), an validator enabled Arbitrary Message Bridge (LayerZero, Wormhole) or a solver network (Across, UniswapX) waits for finality on origin chain. \n3. **Output transaction on target chain:** After waiting for finality the trusted party satisfies users request on the target chain.\n\n \n![SEP34 Image 1.png](ipfs://bafkreihnypngcfwz5nshat4r7bvap4avims3y3af4xtvmwzi33l5mgmt6i)\n    \n\nToday step 2 i.e. waiting for finality is the cross-chain UX bottleneck. OneBalance introduces the concept of credible accounts:\n\n```markdown\nSmart Accounts + Resource Locks = Credible Accounts\n```\n\nUsing resource locks smart accounts can lock their state at the speed of signing removing the need to wait for finality and unlocking instantaneous cross-chain UX. \n\nAfter resource locks the solver on the target chain can instantaneously satisfy the users intent on the target chain, without waiting for finality and decoupling the input and the output transaction.\n\nWe already have a host of partners ready to design, build and distribute credible accounts across the EVM ecosystem. This module is a way to convert SAFEs into credible accounts.\n\n1. [List of partners](https://x.com/OneBalance_io/status/1800232100848619866)\n2. [How we will work together](https://x.com/OneBalance_io/status/1800587282069540883)\n\n## **Current status**\n\n```markdown\nDoes the offering (product/service) already exist or is the funding used to create it?\n```\n\nThe design for Resource Lock Mod contracts is ready and discussed with Gnosis Guild and OneBalance team. We need the grant to:\n\n1. Implement the design in solidity \n2. Get the module audited\n3. Integrate Resource Lock Module in Safe Wallet and Safe Core SDK\n\n### **Risks**\n\n```markdown\nWhat risks does the initiative entail?\n```\n\nThe risks involved are implementation and execution risks. Given the experience of author teams the risks should be minimal.\n\n### **Timeline and milestones**\n\n```markdown\nProvide a detailed timeline or roadmap, include key milestones\n```\n\n| Week | Focus | Outcomes | USDC | $SAFE |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1-4 | Design, Documentation and Development | Development of Module contracts | 25k | N/A |\n| 5-8 | Auditing the module | Auditing the module | 50k | N/A |\n\n### **Initiative lead**\n\n```markdown\nWho is the accountable initiative lead?

Within the scope of this project, we would like to upgrade our implementation to use Safe Smart Accounts.\n\nYou can find our project pitch deck here: \n[NFC Wallet Presentation-small.pdf|attachment](upload://hzAENl5D1G90x71Ptf2bIZ0T8WR.pdf) (713.4 KB)\n\n\n## **Aligned strategy**: Which pre-approved strategy is this initiative driving forward?\n\nFoster module ecosystem\n\n## **Funding request**: What resources are being requested from SafeDAO in USDC?\n\n10 000 USDC\n\n## **Relation to budget**: \n\n3% of total budget\n\n## Metrics and KPIs: Which metrics and KPIs will the initiative be measured against?\n\nWe believe the initiative should be measured against:\n- Quality level of proposed modules. \n- Assessing the ease of use to set up the account \n- Assessing the security of the implementation \n- Usage of modules: We plan to use the implementation at several events where we will measure the transaction volume, number of unique users and user satisfaction. \n\nBy regularly monitoring these metrics and KPIs, we will be able to assess the performance and impact of our initiative, make data-driven decisions, and ensure that we are meeting the needs and expectations of our users and stakeholders.\n\n## **Initiative Description**: What is the initiative about?\n\n**Objective:**\n\nOur project aims to create a Safe Card Manager Module which will enable NFC tags to use Safe Accounts. This enables the tag to conduct physical transactions with whitelisted vendors. Event organizers are able to instantiate their own Account Factory which will generate unique Accounts for that specific instance.\n\nIn order to achieve this with Safe, we need to explore the usage of Safe Accounts for this use case and deliver an MVP solution. We want to validate the usage and implementation with SafeDAO.\n\nThe end goal is to submit another proposal to build a web interface for the Card Management and include it as an app in the Safe dashboard. \n\n**Overview:**\n\nNFC technology allows for seamless and contactless interactions, making it ideal for environments where speed and convenience are paramount. Our current NFC accounts have proven effective for various real-world applications. However, to further increase security and functionality, we plan to upgrade our implementation to leverage the robust features of Safe Wallets.\n\n**Key Features:**\n\n- **Users don't need to install anything:** They can be completely offline and simply use their NFC tag to receive/send.\n- **Partial offline usage:** Only vendors with their Kiosks require an internet connection.\n- **Users don't realize that it's Web3:** No gas fees, no seed phrases and still on-chain.\n- **Account Abstraction:** NFC tags are linked to an account derived counterfactually from their UIDs.\n- **Vendors have custody over the funds they collect:** Vendors install a Kiosk App (iOS or Android) which they get whitelisted by the event organizer and use to charge customers. The Kiosk app operates its own Safe and has control over its own Safe normally through ERC4337. \n\n- **Ease of Use:** The NFC badges or tags enable quick and effortless transactions, simply by tapping the badge or tag against an NFC reader. This simplifies the process for users, particularly in busy or high-traffic environments.\n\n- **Versatile Applications:** The integrated solution is perfect for various use cases, including:\n\n  - **Event Management:** Attendees can use NFC badges for ticketing, access control, and purchases within the event venue.\n\n  - **Community Tokens:** Communities can issue tokens that members can use for services, goods, or rewards, facilitating local economies and engagement.\n\nOur initiative has 3 components:\n\n1. Web app that displays the contents of the Smart Account relevant to the event. \n\n2. Kiosk App (iOS & Android): a mobile application that serves as point of sale or faucet where you can withdraw or add tokens to an NFC tag.\\\n   For these users (which will be businesses most of the time) it would be very beneficial that their Kiosk is a Safe Account. That way they would get access to features of the Safe ecosystem and the Safe dashboard. Definitely the multisig functionality would be a useful security measure if the PoS is used by multiple people. \n\n3. NFC Card Manager: A smart contract which handles the whitelist and account generation for NFC tags.\n\n## **Current status**: Does the offering (product/service) already exist or is the funding used to create it?\n\nWe have already built an NFC transaction solution compatible with standard account abstracted wallets. The goal of the funding is to make it compatible with Safe Accounts and to improve the security of the implementation. The system is being used at several events within the crypto ecosystem. The latest event was Celo Gather Berlin: <https://citizenwallet.net/posts/implementing-nfc-wallet-at-celogather> \n\n## **Risks**: What risks does the initiative entail?\n\n**Integration Challenges:**\n\n- **Risk:** The integration of NFC technology with Safe wallets may encounter technical difficulties, such as compatibility issues or unforeseen bugs.\n\n* **Mitigation:** Conduct thorough testing in various environments, maintain a robust debugging process, and collaborate closely with the technical teams of both Safe and NFC technologies.\n\n**Security Vulnerabilities:**\n\n- **Risk:** Cards can be emulated or cloned with specific readers.\n\n* **Mitigation:** Salt the NFC tags (mitigates serial number guessing), use the secure memory of NTAGs (mitigates cloning), and inform Kiosk users to look out for non-standard cards or other devices.\n\n**Partnership Dependency:**\n\n- **Risk:** The success of the project depends on establishing and maintaining partnerships with event organizers and community leaders.\n\n- **Mitigation:** Develop a robust partnership strategy, including clear communication of benefits and collaborative engagement plans. Diversify partnerships to avoid over-reliance on a few key partners.\n\n**Resource Constraints:**\n\n- **Risk:** The project may face resource constraints, such as limited funding, manpower, or technical expertise.\n\n- **Mitigation:** Ensure proper project planning and budgeting, seek additional funding opportunities, and consider outsourcing or collaborating with specialized firms for technical development.\n\n## **Timeline and milestones**: Provide a detailed timeline or roadmap, include key milestones\n\n**Phase 1: Deployment of a Safe Card Manager Module (week 1- 2)**\n\n**Milestones:**\n\n• Convert any NFC card into a Safe Smart Account.\n\n• Enable simple tap-to-pay transactions using NFC cards.\n\n**Phase 2: Update the web interface to take into account differences arising from using a Safe Account (week 3)**\n\n**Milestones:**\n\n• Web interface shows balance, allows you to edit your profile.\n\n**Phase 3: Update of Kiosk App (week 4)**\n\n**Milestones:**\n\n• Update the Kiosk/POS app to use Safe Accounts.\n\n• Make the internal testing version available on the App Store and Play Stores for those who need it.\n\n**Phase 4: Submit for review to SafeDAO (week 4)**\n\n• **Milestones:**\n\n• A working demo on Gnosis Chain between a Kiosk and an NFC tag\n\n• On chain data of the transaction\n\n## **Initiative lead:** Who is the accountable initiative lead?\n\n[Citizen Wallet](https://citizenwallet.net/).

      "content": "Please refer to the [full proposal text on the SafeDAO forum](https://forum.safe.global/t/sep-31-obra-next-generation-frontend-for-decentralized-safe-registry/5371). Some parts may have been removed to fit within the character limit on Snapshot.\n\n## Title: \n[SEP 31] [OBRA]: Next generation frontend for decentralized Safe Registry\n\n\n## Authors:\n@isolo\n\n## Created:\n2024-06-14\n\n## Abstract\nDaoism Systems has successfully developed the [dSAFE SDK](https://app.charmverse.io/safe-grants-program/page-5195256681472322), providing a decentralized alternative to the Safe Transaction Service. As a follow-up project, we now propose to develop the next-generation frontend, which includes a UI/UX optimized web interface and an innovative Telegram bot called [NinDAO](https://mirror.xyz/0013700.eth/KJOhn_HACguhadefd69Otwzy6s5eUBb7JcIVrPXlFtA). This integration will leverage account abstraction to enhance user-friendliness, enabling voting and transaction management directly through Telegram.\n\n## Aligned Strategy\nWildcard Strategy: Our initiative supports the SafeDAO strategy of driving decentralization, improving user experience, and expanding the Safe ecosystem through innovative solutions.\n\n## Funding Request\nWe are requesting $96,000 USDC in total.\n\n### Budget Breakdown:\n*   UX/UI design with a web3 specialized design studio: $10,000\n*   Senior Frontend Developer: $8,000 per month for 4.5 months = $36,000\n*   Project Manager: $5,000 per month for 5 months = $25,000\n*   Senior Tech Lead / Backend (50% time): $5,000 per month for 5 months = $25,000\n\n**Relation to Strategy budget:** The requested funding is 96% of the total initiative budget.\n\n## Upfront Funding\nNo upfront payment is requested. Funding will be streamed according to SafeDAO’s terms for mid to large projects over a duration of 20 weeks.\n\n## Payment Terms\n**Initial Cliff:** No payments for the first 4 weeks as per Mid to large projects (≥ 10k USDC).\n\n**Payment Distribution:** After the 4-week cliff, payments will be streamed over the remaining 16 weeks, with 4,800 USD per week.\n\n## Initiative Description\nThe Safe protocol's reliance on a centralized transaction service poses several risks, More information on this topic can be found [here](https://mirror.xyz/0013700.eth/HAxUoydAAvcEnygRvGsqecAhC1XcfcQlAy6x_htY3ZQ). To address these risks, we developed the [Decentralized Safe Registry (dSAFE) SDK](https://github.com/daoism-systems/dSafe-SDK) using Ceramic Protocol and ComposeDB. This provides a secure, resilient, and transparent alternative by decentralizing storage and management of Safe transactions. Users benefit from reduced risks, improved resilience, and greater autonomy with an IPFS-hosted front-end. Building on this, our next step is developing a UI/UX optimized web interface and the NinDAO Telegram bot, enabling seamless governance directly through Telegram, further enhancing the Safe ecosystem.\n\n### UI/UX Optimized Web Interface\n\nTo enable and simplify the use of the new decentralized dSAFE SDK, a user-friendly frontend is essential. A UI/UX-optimized web interface will not only make interactions with the platform easier but also help attract more users. By providing an intuitive and accessible user interface, we can make the benefits of decentralized technology more widely available and increase adoption within the Safe community and beyond.\n\n### NinDAO Telegram Bot\n\nDAO tooling facilitates the creation, management, and governance of decentralized autonomous organizations, encompassing voting, proposals, and collective treasury management. These tools are fundamentally about enabling conversation and coordination for groups, projects, or collectives practicing self-custody over shared assets. However, most current tools are neither intuitive for seasoned DAO members nor accessible for newcomers.\n\nNinDAO represents the next generation of DAO management by leveraging Telegram, a familiar chat interface, to transform group chats into DAOs using Safe multisig. This intuitive solution bridges Telegram, Wallet Connect, and Safe Multisig, allowing users to manage DAOs directly within the chat. Users can handle on-chain governance operations, manage the treasury, and execute multisig transactions without leaving Telegram.\n\nAs the next step NinDAO could incorporate Telegram native account abstraction based access to Ethereum ecosystem. By incorporating account abstraction, NinDAO significantly simplifies web3 usage, making DAO management more accessible and user-friendly. This innovative approach enhances usability for both web3 natives and newcomers, promoting ownership in a secure and intuitive manner.\n\nFurthermore, by integrating familiar Telegram identities with Account Abstraction technology, we can greatly improve Safe usability and boost its adoption.\n\n#### In a nutshell:\n\n*   **Next-Generation DAO Management:** Transforms group chats into DAOs using Safe multisig, allowing users to manage governance operations seamlessly within Telegram.\n\n*   **Enhanced Accessibility through Account Abstraction:** Simplifies web3 usage by leveraging a familiar chat interface, making Safe management accessible to both experienced users and newcomers.\n\n*   **Broadening Safe Technology Adoption:** By integrating with Telegram, NinDAO makes Safe technology more accessible to the general public, attracting more users and expanding the Safe ecosystem.\n\n## Current Status\n\nNinDAO won a Gnosis Safe bounty at the ETHLisbon hackathon. NinDAO also became SafeDAO Guardians. We have also successfully completed the backend development of the dSAFE SDK, which is currently functional and integrated with the Safe Transaction Service. Additionally, a feasibility study for NinDAO has been conducted and successfully tested, proving its viability. You can find a short introduction Video of NinDAO [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bH6DVO39x3o). We have also developed a self-funded foundation for the Telegram bot. NinDAO is now ready for finalization and launch, ensuring a seamless and innovative DAO management experience through Telegram.\n\n## Risks\n\nBuilding composable and integrated projects can be challenging, as our product's successful functioning often relies on other teams and projects. The current implementation of NinDAO depends on Telegram, WalletConnect, MetaMask, the Safe API, Safe smart contracts, and more, leading to high complexity.\n\n## Timeline and Milestones\n\n|What|Description|Duration|\n|--- |--- |--- |\n|UI/UX Design (Desktop, Mobile, NinDAO)|Create a comprehensive design for both desktop and mobile interfaces, as well as the NinDAO Telegram bot. Conduct user research, develop wireframes, prototypes, and finalize designs.|Weeks 1-4|\n|Desktop & Mobile Frontend Development|Develop the frontend for both desktop and mobile platforms based on the finalized UI/UX designs.

Percentage of delegated voting power actively participating in governance.\n    2. Percentage of active delegates per proposal.\n- **Delegate Accountability Metrics**\n    1. Frequency of delegate participation in voting.\n\n## **Initiative description**\n\nAs outlined in the [SEP #16](https://forum.safe.global/t/sep-16-obra-split-delegation-gnosis-guild/4673) proposal, there are limitations in delegating voting power on Snapshot. The Split Delegation feature offers several advantages, including:\n\n- Delegating to multiple participants simultaneously.\n- Transitivity of delegated voting power.\n- Delegation term limits.\n\nAt Goverland, we aim to enhance this functionality by enabling delegation on mobile and increasing transparency in delegate performance. Goverland app users will be able to configure flexible notifications about their delegates' voting participation and receive alerts about events such as:\n\n- How delegates vote on proposals.\n- If delegates ignore certain proposals.\n- If delegates create new proposals.\n\nThe outcome of this work will be increased participation of SAFE token holders in governance and improved awareness of SafeDAO updates.\n\n## **Current status**\n\nWe have successfully implemented DAO updates and voting functionalities within the Goverland App. Additional work is required to introduce convenient delegation features and enhance transparency and accountability of delegate activities.\n\n## **Risks**\n\nWith the Split Delegation feature expected to be available on Snapshot soon (the [PR](https://github.com/snapshot-labs/snapshot/pull/4492/files) is open and should be integrated in the coming weeks), we do not anticipate any significant technical risks in integrating it into the Goverland App.\n\n## **Timeline and milestones**\n\n| Week | Focus | Outcomes | USDC |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1-4 | Phase 1: Design, Implementation, Release | Integration of Split Delegation feature into the Goverland App. Outcome: View SafeDAO delegates, delegate/re-delegate using a connected wallet, and view delegate profiles. | 8.000 |\n| 5-8 | Phase 2: Design, Implementation, Release | Implement customizable notifications about delegate activities, including push notifications.  | 8.000 |\n\n## **Initiative lead**\n\n[Goverland](https://goverland.xyz/)\n\n## Team\n\nThis task will be handled by one designer and two engineers from the Goverland team.\n\n## **Additional support/resources**\n\nThe Goverland team is in contact with Gnosis Guild and Snapshot teams to ensure a smooth and high-quality integration of the Split Delegation feature. No additional support is required.\n\n## Misc\n\n[Link to the initial discussion](https://forum.safe.global/t/discussion-obra-native-split-delegation-on-mobile-with-notifications-about-delegate-participation-goverland/5349)\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via CC0.",

      "content": "Please refer to the [full proposal text on the SafeDAO forum](https://forum.safe.global/t/sep-29-obra-nounish-safes-rocketman/5121). Some parts may have been removed to fit within the character limit on Snapshot.\n\n## Title: \n[SEP 29] [OBRA] Nounish Safes - rocketman\n\n## Authors:\n\n@rocketman-21\n\n## Created:\n\n2024-04-23\n\n## Abstract\n\nWorking with Auryn from Gnosis Guild, we have built an [extension on the Revolution Protocol ](https://github.com/collectivexyz/revolution-protocol/pull/146) that enables any Safe to become a Nounish DAO. The first DAO launched through this system is [Grounds DAO. ](https://groundsdao.wtf/)\n\nAny new or existing safe that wants to become or facilitate the creation of a Nounish DAO where the DAO treasury is a Safe now has an avenue to do so. We’d like to continue building this extension out through a website that lets any Safe convert to a DAO using the protocol.\n\nWe also plan to develop a Safe Module extension.\n\n## Aligned strategy\nStrategy 2\n\n## Funding request\n$30k USDC\n\n**If applicable, upfront funding**\n\nUpfront funding is preferred, our team is short on funds and have already put significant time and effort into the protocol to make this possible. Recent PR can be seen [here. ](https://github.com/collectivexyz/revolution-protocol/pull/146)\n\n## Relation to budget\n\nState the requested funding as a percentage of the total initiative budget:\n\n10% of Strategy 2\n\n## Metrics and KPIs\n\n1. Number of existing Safe’s launched as Nounish DAOs.\n\n2. Total treasury size of the Safes.\n\n3. Number of new Safes launched as Nounish DAOs.\n\n## Initiative description\n\nBuilding on SafeDAO’s mission, we’re working to combine the secure and flexible capabilities of Safe with the collaborative governance model of DAOs, particularly inspired by the Nouns DAO concept.\n\nWe are opening up a realm of possibilities for community-driven governance and collaborative decision-making. The Revolution Protocol extension we’re working on is designed to enable any Safe, old or new, to transform into a Nounish DAO. Grounds DAO is our first step, serving as a proof of concept.\n\nBy enabling Safes to create their own DAOs, we’re not just enhancing functionality; we’re empowering communities to fairly govern. This initiative will make it straightforward for any group with a shared purpose to manage their assets collectively, make decisions, and take action together, all on top of the trusted framework of Safe.\n\nWe’re also focusing on building a user-friendly website. This platform will be the bridge for Safe users to easily transition their Safes into DAOs, lowering the barrier to entry for participation in web3 governance and collaborative efforts.\n\nBy integrating DAO functionalities into Safe, we’re expanding the utility and applicability of Safe and reinforcing the ecosystem’s capacity for innovation and community-driven development.\n\nThis initiative is a step forward in realizing SafeDAO’s vision of web3 and building on the solid foundation of Safe to offer more ways for users to collaborate, innovate, and govern themselves. We’re not just creating a tool; we’re opening up new pathways for community engagement and empowerment.\n\nYou can read more about the Revolution protocol on [GitHub](https://github.com/collectivexyz/revolution-protocol) and [Mirror](https://mirror.xyz/rocketman21.eth/9uJnUU7scfHIS7t_3lp_BltoxoKlRKkZCaWC1mV4aLI).\n\n## Current status\n\nAn MVP of a [protocol upgrade ](https://github.com/collectivexyz/revolution-protocol/pull/146) was completed last week that enabled the creation of Grounds DAO on top of Safe. We want to continue work on building out the protocol extension to better support Safe, and build a website and UI to easily enable any Safe to convert to a Nounish DAO.\n\n## Risks\n\nThe protocol was audited in February, but new changes with the Safe extension introduce security risks until we get another audit. We are taking a slow and measured approach to changes made to contracts.\n\n## Cost Breakdown\n\n**Audit with 0x52:** $8,000 for a 3-day audit (minimum available).\n**Development of the Safe Site, Protocol Extension, and Outreach:** $22k\n**Total:** $30,000 USDC\n\n## Breakdown by Milestone:\n\n**Q3 2024: Protocol Extension Launch (In Progress)**\n• **June:** Complete development and deployment of the protocol extension allowing any Safe to become a Nounish DAO.\n• **Milestone:** First Safe launch as a Nounish DAO using the extension - Grounds DAO.\n• **Cost:** $8,000 (Audit with 0x52 for 3 days)\n\n**Q3 2024: Website and UI Development**\n• **June - July:** Design and develop a user-friendly website and UI.\n• **Milestone:** Launch of the website and UI.\n• **Cost:** $10,000 (Development split between Rocketman and Wojciech)\n\n**Q3 2024: Module Development**\n• **June - July:** Build and launch a Safe module.\n• **Milestone:** Launch of the Safe module.\n• **Cost:** $5,000 (Development split between Rocketman and Wojciech)\n\n**Q3 2024: Community Building and Outreach**\n• **August:** Initiate community outreach to educate Safe owners on the benefits of transitioning to a Nouns DAO structure.\n• **Milestone:** Publish a series of mirror articles and videos to educate the community.\n• **Cost:** $2,500 (Outreach and content creation split between Rocketman and Wojciech)\n\n**Q4 2024: Expansion and Scaling**\n• **August:** Scale the initiative, support more Safes in transitioning to DAOs, and explore further integrations.\n• **Milestone:** Achieve 10 Safes converted into Nounish DAOs with a combined treasury size surpassing $1M.\n• **Cost:** $4,500 (Expansion efforts split between Rocketman and Wojciech)\n**Total:** $30,000 USDC\n\n## Initiative lead\n\nRocketman - [https://twitter.com/rocketman_w ](https://twitter.com/rocketman_w)\n\n## Team\n\n2 people, rocketman and Wojciech.\n\nRocketman founded [https://collective.xyz](https://collective.xyz/) in 2021 and led product development.

These provisions allow the Foundation to deviate from governance cycles if needed, which gives SafeDAO the possibility to vote in a flexible manner on certain topics while still keeping the general structure. Specifically, this allows:\n\n* Amendments to the governance framework to be proposed and voted on in any sprint of the season, not just sprint 4.\n* Amendments to OBRA framework, OBRA strategies and budget to be proposed and voted on any sprint of the season, not just sprint 4.\n* Propose and vote on non-governance proposals in Sprint 4 if needed.\n\n## Proposal types\n\nState which proposal type this proposal belongs to.\n\n- [ ] SEP: Constitutional Proposals\n- [X] SEP: Governance Proposals\n- [ ] Other SEPs\n\n## Proposal details\n\n**Purpose and Background**\n\n**Background**\n\nThe following topics are currently available for amendments in Sprint 4/Governance specific proposals:\n\n1. Governance framework (i.e. changes to scope of governance, voting process and mechanism, governance cycle)\n2. OBRA budget (creating a new budget or changing existing budget)\n3.

OBRA framework (changes to purpose, submission requirements, review/voting process, payout procedures)\n\nAdditionally, in the current governance framework, there are 4 Sprints in a Season, but amendments to the governance framework and OBRA framework are only possible in the 4th sprint. \n\n> 2. **Sprint 4: Review and governance amendment sprint**\n> \n> As a counterpart to the restriction of governance proposals during the first 3 sprints, the 4th sprint is dedicated to governance review and governance proposals. During this time, no other proposals shall be submitted.\n\nThe intention behind this is to reduce noise and hone attention onto governance proposals. However, since its implementation, SafeDAO has actively worked with these frameworks and it is to be expected that certain amendments need flexibility to be proposed in Sprint 1-3 and not just in Sprint 4.\n\nTherefore in order to maintain agility at this stage of the DAO, we propose to extend the soft launch provision for governance framework and OBRA for Season 3.\n\n## Changes to the Governance Framework\n\n| **Original** | **New** |\n|---|---|\n| **H. Annex 1: Season 1 and 2** | **H. Annex 1: Season 1, *2 and 3*** |\n| For Season 1 and 2, the governance framework will operate under a soft launch protocol. Recognizing the need for flexibility during the formative phase of SafeDAO, the Foundation retains the prerogative to deviate from the processes laid out in D.II. Governance cycles and E.II. Proposal and voting sprints if necessary to ensure an efficient decision-making process. Any deviations will be communicated transparently and are subject to review in the review and governance amendment sprint. This exception is limited to Season 1 and is introduced to allow a smoother transition into the new governance framework. | For Season 1, *2 and 3*, the governance framework will operate under a soft launch protocol.

This exception is limited to *the respective seasons* and is introduced to allow a smoother transition into the new governance framework. |\n\n## Changes to OBRA\n\n| **Original** | **New** |\n|---|---|\n| **G. Soft launch** | **G. Soft launch*** |\n| This exception is limited to Season 1 and 2, introduced to allow a smoother transition into the new resource allocation framework. | For Season 1, *2 and 3*, the resource allocation framework will operate under a soft launch protocol.

Submission and review cycles if necessary to ensure an efficient resource allocation process. Any deviations will be communicated transparently and are subject to review in the review and governance amendment sprint. This exception is limited to *the respective season*s and is introduced to allow a smoother transition into the new resource allocation framework.|\n\n## Effects and Impact Analysis\n\nChanges can introduce the following risks:\n\n1. **Scenario 1:** There are too many governance proposals which dilute the attention of governance participants.\n**Mitigation**: The soft launch provision keeps the general structure of the governance cycles and only exceptionally deviates from it. This allows a balanced approach.\n\n2. **Scenario 2:** The Foundation continues to hold the power to deviate from procedures.\n**Mitigation:** There is a transparent review process in Sprint 4.\n\n## Alternative Solutions\n\nWe considered a few alternatives:\n\n* **Option 1: Removing the Sprint 4 governance limitation, but introducing a different threshold for proposal amendments (increased quorum, voting, etc).**\nThis option could be possible in the future as SafeDAO already has proposal types implemented. However, varying degrees of voting systems feels premature at this stage and needs technical amendments to the voting system to enforce these.\n\n* **Option 2: Removing voting cycle permanently.**\nThis option might be a future outcome if we realize that the governance cycles are not needed. Currently, the soft launch provisions balance out the pre-determined structure and needed flexibility.\n\n* **Option 3: Delay. Extending Season 3, Sprint 1 as governance amendment sprint with no OBRA proposals or being parallel.**\nThis option would be a short term solution that requires the DAO to go through another vote in the next sprint to make necessary adjustments.\n\n* **Option 4: No changes.**\nWithout soft launch provision, governance changes would need to wait until Sprint 4. Depending on the urgency, this could have adversarial effects where the process turns into a burden.\n\n## Implementation\n\nDoes the implementation of the proposal require new code?

Some parts may have been removed to fit within the character limit on Snapshot.\n\n## Title: \nOBRA Budget Amendments Season 2, Sprint 4\n\n## Authors: \nAndre Geest (Safe, @Andre),  Amy (Safe, @amy.sg)\n\n## Created: \n2014-05-20\n\n## Abstract\nThis proposal suggests the following for the OBRA budget in Season 3:\n\nWith a little over half a million USDC, there is ample OBRA budget in left for Season 3, therefore no new budget should be proposed in this sprint. Instead, the remaining OBRA budget from the end of Season 2 should be redistributed into strategies with low or no budget. This proposal suggests three options for Season 3 OBRA budget.\n\n## Proposal types\n\nState which proposal type this proposal belongs to.\n\n[] SEP: Constitutional Proposals\n\n[] SEP: Governance Proposals\n\n[X] SEP: Resource Allocation Budget\n\n## Proposal details\n\n**Purpose and Background**\n\n**Background**\n\nIn the current OBRA framework, unspent budget from previous seasons are carried over to the next season.\n\n### [Quote from [SEP 10] OBRA strategies and budget](https://forum.safe.global/t/sep-10-obra-strategies-and-budget/4459)\n\"**Proposal details**\nThe overall budget mentioned here is for Season 1 and Season 2 according to the governance framework and OBRA. The budget acts as an upper threshold, allowing any unspent amount to be carried over to the next season.\"\n\nHowever, it does not define how the budget should be distributed. As of the end of Sprint 3 of Season 2, the following budget remains for each strategy [(from live OBRA budget tracker)](https://safe-global.notion.site/Get-funding-from-SafeDAO-ba1e63169d2d4bc08fd50ace9b95f12f?pvs=74):\n \n![4c3558817a157e37f4c754b1976994b00b24c056_2_1248x490.jpeg](ipfs://bafybeia6gky4nvpm3vdjysz7lx5g7dsg6alefepd3lsp32o4koqbegbgnq)\n    \n\nThe total unspent budget amounts to: **[593.500 USDC]**. This means that there is still significant budget left and ample budget remaining for Strategies 1, 3, and 4.\n\n**With this in mind, the options for proposed changes to OBRA Budget:**\n\n**Option 1:** Redistribute larger budgets to popular strategies that have less budget available. (See below table for the respective changes):\n \n![1abbdeffc46fa22c24b0a2db23384b269e50ce4c_2_1248x592.jpeg](ipfs://bafybeia7xp5bo2om7jr5dspwgyemuln3yz74pymltiufk2pqx66brrxsqm)\n  \n**Option 2:** Redistribute larger budgets to popular strategies with less budget available, but with more even distribution (reduces the previous weights of each strategy).\n \n![d4a9d56b0ca1a80a51fd3d64599f63a3f124e06d_2_1248x574.jpeg](ipfs://bafybeia74dxpka2dlv4e65a5e22icpehi5a33pswy7d7qdebdwxyvysbyq)\n\n**Option 3:** No change / Don’t reallocate or propose a new budget.\n\n## Effects and Impact Analysis\n\nChanges can introduce the following risks:\n\n* Scenario 1: There could be teams interested in particular Strategies but have limited budget that will have to wait until the budget is refilled.\n\n## Alternative Solutions\n\nThere can be a number of potential configurations of budgets per strategy. However, we suggested a few calculations to narrow options.\n\nWe also considered mainly topping up the wildcard strategy back to 100k as the main mechanic in providing an overflow for other strategies, as well as initiatives that do not fall under a predetermined strategy. However, this is already a default and would void the point of a directed budget per strategy.\n\n## Implementation\n\nDoes the implementation of the proposal require new code?

      "title": "[SEP #25] [OBRA] Palmera Module: Hierarchical Structure",
      "content": "Please refer to the [full proposal text on the SafeDAO forum](https://forum.safe.global/t/draft-obra-palmera-module-hierarchical-structure/5089). Some parts may have been removed to fit within the character limit on Snapshot.\n\n## Title: \n[SEP #25] [OBRA] Palmera Module: Hierarchical Structure\n\n## **Authors**: \n@andyp\n\n## **Created**:  \n2024-04-17\n\n## Abstract\n\nThe Palmera Module enables organizations, DAOs, and developers, using multiple Safes, to enhance their on-chain operations by facilitating the creation of customizable and flexible hierarchical structures. It democratizes access to on-chain decisions through a delegation structure, wherein upper Safes have configurable rights over subordinate Safes. This proposal is for funding an audit competition for Palmera Module smart contracts by Hats Finance based on their 100% payment by results mechanism.\n\n### Aligned strategy\n\n***Which pre-approved strategy is this initiative driving forward?***\n\n[Strategy 2] Foster module ecosystem\n\n### Funding request\n\n***What resources are being requested from SafeDAO in USDC?***\n\nPalmera asks for $30k funding to conduct an audit competition on Hats Finance protocol to ensure the safety and security of the Palmera on-chain module by using a crowd audit competition. We are allocating $5k to compensate two lead auditors, with each receiving $2.5k. Their task will be to meticulously review every line of our smart contract code to ensure its robustness and security. The remaining $25k will be used as the total bounty for the public audit competition, which might attract up to 800 independent security researchers.\n\n### Upfront funding\n\n***Indicate if upfront funding is needed. Refer to 'Payout’ under[ Get funding from SafeDAO](https://www.notion.so/Get-funding-from-SafeDAO-ba1e63169d2d4bc08fd50ace9b95f12f?pvs=21) for lump sum payment options.***\n\nNot applicable.\n\n### Relation to budget\n\n***State the requested funding as a percentage of the total initiative budget (e.g. if you ask for 50k for Strategy 1: 25%)***\n\n$30k constitutes 10% of the total initiative budget.\n\n### Metrics and KPIs\n\n***Which metrics and KPIs will the initiative be measured against?***\n\n1. Increase the number of Super Safes created.\n2. Improve the management of multi-Safe smart accounts.\n3. Attract more organizations with complex treasury management systems to the Safe ecosystem.\n4. Increase module adoption.\n\n### Initiative description\n\n***What is the initiative about?***\n\nThe Palmera Module has been developed as a common good, contributing to the Safe ecosystem. Palmera Module introduces customizable and flexible hierarchical structures for on-chain operations, enhancing governance and operational efficiency through delegated access and compartmentalized control. This delegation structure allows upper Safes configurable rights over subSafes, streamlining decision-making processes across managing multiple Safes smart wallets.\n\nTraditional fund management often suffers from a flat account hierarchy leading to complex management systems that are not on-chain. The Palmera Module addresses this point by enabling an on-chain structured and layered approach to account management, which is key for a better organization that requires a clear delineation of authority and responsibilities of each Safe.\n\n#### Current Safe Module\n\nSafe Modules are smart contracts that introduce additional functionalities to Safe contracts, offering features like daily spending allowances and social recovery options. They operate by separating module logic from Safe’s core contracts, requiring owner confirmations for modifications.\n\n#### Key Advantages for the Safe Ecosystem\n\n* Customizable Hierarchical Safes Structures: It facilitates the creation of customized governance models adapted to the organization’s needs, promoting efficiency and scalability.\n* Decentralized Decision-Making: Democratizes on-chain decisions by empowering subordinate Safes with specific delegated rights, enhancing operational flexibility.\n* Security Enhancements: Introduces a secure, compartmentalized approach to Safe management, reducing the risk of unauthorized transactions and enhancing overall ecosystem security.\n\n#### Roles Within the Palmera Module\n\n* Root Safe: Acts as the top-level authority with comprehensive control over the entire hierarchy, capable of adding or removing any entity and modifying the structure as needed.\n* Super Safes and Subsafes: Define a parent-child relationship, where Super Safes have administrative rights over their direct Subsafes, allowing for layered access and control.\n* Optional Roles: Provide flexibility to assign specific capabilities such as transaction execution or owner management without granting full administrative rights, tailored to organizational requirements.\n\n#### Contribution to the Growth of the Safe Ecosystem\n\n* Compatibility: Introduces new functionalities while maintaining compatibility with existing Safe standards, encouraging broader adoption.\n* Community Engagement: Offers new tools for developers and organizations; the Palmera Module stimulates community engagement and developer activity within the Safe ecosystem.\n* Market Competitiveness: Enhances the Safe ecosystem for existing and prospective users by providing advanced and flexible solutions for on-chain governance and operations.\n\n#### Use Cases of the Palmera Module\n\n* DAO Management: A DAO can use the Palmera Module to establish a governance framework where each group or subgroup controls its own Safe. This allows for localized decision-making while aligning with the DAO’s governance and objectives. For instance, a marketing group can manage its funds and approve related expenditures within pre-defined limits. Additionally, the clawback functionality of the module allows for the retraction of funds from these subgroups if mismanagement happens or if strategic priorities shift, ensuring more control and flexibility.\n* On-chain organization Treasury Management: organizations can leverage the Palmera Module to create a hierarchical financial structure where the central treasury Safe oversees subsidiary Safes assigned to different departments or projects. This structure enables departments to operate independently but within the constraints set by the central treasury, optimizing budget allocations and financial oversight.\n* Startup Ecosystem Support: Startups within an incubator can be structured using the Palmera Module to allow each entity to manage its operations while the parent Safe, controlled by the incubator, retains oversight and the ability to claw back funds if necessary. This setup supports autonomous growth with safeguarded risk management.\n* Educational Grant Distributions: Educational institutions can use the Palmera Module to manage and distribute grant money to different research departments. Each department’s Safe can autonomously handle day-to-day expenses while the main administrative Safe retains the authority to review and manage overall spending, ensuring funds are used appropriately and efficiently.\n* CD Pipeline Integration: Developers can use the Palmera Module to facilitate smart contract deployments. This ensures that deployments and updates are managed through controlled, traceable, and secure workflows, enhancing operational efficiency and reliability in software development processes.\n\n#### Interested Parties\n\nFor the Palmera Module, we have spoken with multiple projects, like Toku and alloc8, that have demonstrated interest. These projects were looking for:\n\n1. A way to encapsulate risk for contract management.\n2. Use transactions on behalf of a batch call to multiple Safes (i.e., you go through the multisig process on the root Safe that is a batch call that creates transactions for multiple child safes).\n3. The possibility of a delegation structure to partition treasury for small funds.\n\nThe purpose of the proposal is to acquire funding to be used as the bounty for the audit competition to be conducted on Hats Finance in order to make sure that the on-chain module will be free of bugs and vulnerabilities.\n\nAdditional resources:\n\n* Documentation: [Palmera Module ](https://docs.palmeradao.xyz/palmera-module-safe-hierarchical-structure/smart-contracts/palmera-module)\n* LongHashX Safe{AAccelerator} Demo Day | Palmera:[ Presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dn4QBQI4jTA)\n\nA Brief Background for Hats Finance Audit Competitions:\n\nHats audit competitions are revolutionizing the world of Web3 security, offering a dynamic, cost-effective, and time-efficient solution for smart contract auditing. By transforming the traditional auditing approach, they ensure enhanced security through a community-driven process. With audit competitions, projects retain full control over your budget, attract top auditing talent, and gain valuable insights from the Web3 community, all while preparing your project for a robust and secure launch. Hats audit competitions work on a simple yet powerful model — rewarding results, not efforts. The project teams allocate budgets according to the severity level of potential vulnerabilities. The budget is retained if no flaws are found. It’s a model that ensures projects pay only for value added to your project, giving you confidence in your investment.\n\n### Current status\n\n***Does the offering (product/service) already exist or is the funding used to create it?***\n\nThe Palmera Module has been developed and is ready for a security audit before its official release and deployment. The only part missing before a safe and secure launch is the code audit. The requested funding will create the on-chain audit competition vault on Hats protocol. As a decentralized, on-chain, transparent security protocol, Hats Finance requires the total audit competition bounty to be deposited to the relevant audit competition vault before the competition’s launch.\n\n### Risks\n\n***What risks does the initiative entail?***\n\nThe only foreseeable risks for this initiative are the smart contract risks. However, Hats Finance, having gone through 6 audits + audit competitions and ongoing bug bounty, has been live for more than 2 years and used by more than 80 projects so far. Even SafeDAO has a bug bounty of $100k (externally up to $1m) on Hats Finance. Accordingly, we assume that Hats Finance has a robust, secure and battle-tested protocol.\n\n### Timeline and milestones\n\n***Provide a detailed timeline or roadmap, include key milestones***\n\n|Milestone|Description|Duration|\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|1. Setting up the audit competition vault and promoting it to the security researchers|Palmera will set up the audit competition vault as described in the proposal and help Hats Finance promote it the security researcher for maximum participation|1 week|\n|2. The competition process|Palmera team will review, classify and label the submissions, and answer the questions of security researchers in the process|2 weeks|\n|3.

      "content": "Please refer to the [full proposal text on the SafeDAO forum](https://forum.safe.global/t/sep-24-karpatkey-safe-dao-treasury-management-core-unit/4893). Some parts may have been removed to fit within the character limit on Snapshot.\n\n# Title: \n[SEP #24] karpatkey - SAFE DAO Treasury Management Core Unit\n\n# **Authors**: \n@karpatkey\n\n# **Created**:  \n2024-03-25\n\n# **Abstract**\n\nWith the SafeDAO having achieved all milestones laid out in [SEP #3](https://snapshot.org/#/safe.eth/proposal/0xdcd7f8cb197c7132296d802e538df2a565fbe4f8af400f1afbed06b54a808060) and approaching its token transferability, we propose for karpatkey to become the treasury manager to SafeDAO and, as part of the mandate, delegate treasury management of the joint SafeDAO <> GnosisDAO treasury to karpatkey.\n\n## **Proposal types**\nState which proposal type this proposal belongs to.\n\n- [] SEP: Constitutional Proposals\n- [] SEP: Governance Proposals\n- [x] Other SEP \n\n# **Proposal details**\n\n## ***Purpose and Background***\n\nHaving accomplished the objectives outlined in [SEP #3](https://snapshot.org/#/safe.eth/proposal/0xdcd7f8cb197c7132296d802e538df2a565fbe4f8af400f1afbed06b54a808060), including the creation of a constitution, a governance framework, a system for resource distribution, and the definition of token utility, SafeDAO has completed all the necessary steps for its token transferability.\n\nWith the foundational elements of SafeDAO in place, the focus naturally shifts to the efficient and strategic management of the DAO's assets. karpatkey with its expertise in managing DAO treasuries is well-positioned to undertake this role, supporting SafeDAO in treasury management, risk management, governance, and driving research and investment suggestions to grow the SafeDAO ecosystem.\n\nAlongside the token transferability, the unlocking of the [joint treasury](https://etherscan.io/address/0xd28b432f06cb64692379758b88b5fcdfc4f56922) between GnosisDAO and SafeDAO will take place. We propose delegating the joint treasury management to karpatkey as part of the mandate. Any future treasury management of SafeDAO treasury assets will go through a further vote.\n\n# ***Effects and Impact Analysis***\n\nWe propose for karpatkey to become a service provider to SafeDAO, contributing to the following:\n\n* Treasury management\n* Protocol integrations for $SAFE\n* Risk management\n* Research\n\nkarpatkey will build a dedicated treasury team that will contribute to SafeDAO. This will also work on establishing a path and framework for the future treasury management of SafeDAO and management of the joint treasury alongside ongoing research, governance, and risk management support.\n\nkarpatkey’s expertise in risk management is crucial for active treasury management. Risk management plays a crucial role in strategy. Our risk team evaluates the security, reliability, and performance history of each protocol we use. We also continuously monitor the protocols we have funds deployed with for any emerging threats or vulnerabilities. Moreover, karpatkey has built risk management infrastructure on top of Safe / Zodiac, including our Execution App (AxA) and Guardians. The AxA allows treasury managers to instantly withdraw from positions when risk is detected, while Guardians are autonomous risk monitors that withdraw positions when certain activities such as exploits or depegs are detected.\n\nToday, karpatkey is an active governance participant in leading DAOs, such as GnosisDAO, Aave, Arbitrum, Lido, and Uniswap. Our experience in governance allows us to contribute and be a proactive governance member in SafeDAO.\n\nkarpatkey will also advise on investments aimed at strategically allocating SafeDAO's resources to foster innovation, support community projects, and invest in opportunities that align with SafeDAO's mission and objectives.\n\n# **Alternative Solutions**\n\nThe joint treasury is currently a 2-of-2 Safe with SafeDAO and GnosisDAO as signers. Without a delegated treasury manager acting upon the treasury would require finding agreement among both DAOs to undertake any actions on the treasury, likely with governance proposals required to take any actions. This would have the consequence of significant governance overhead and make it impractical to actively deploy the treasury.\n\nThe SafeDAO may choose to explore alternative service providers and processes for entrusting the management of the collective treasury. The SafeDAO may also choose not to have a managed treasury and leave assets idle.\n\n\n# ***Implementation***\n\n[x] Own implementation possible\n[] Own implementation but with funding (how much % to implementation)\n[ ] Request for technical support through Safe matter experts\n\nAccording to [GIP-29](https://forum.gnosis.io/t/gip-29-spin-off-safedao-and-launch-safe-token/3476), 5% of the SAFE tokens are allocated to a shared treasury by SafeDAO and GnosisDAO intended to fund rewards beneficial to both the Safe and Gnosis communities.\n\nWe propose that SafeDAO entrust the management of this collective treasury to karpatkey, which is already managing GnosisDAO's treasury as per [GIP-58](https://snapshot.org/#/gnosis.eth/proposal/0x867149a44d4f2324520f9f0f8a0d91988b26e4ba4d8662635b29ca733a1354b8). This positions karpatkey optimally to manage the joint treasury efficiently and align the interests of both communities.\n\nThe joint treasury will be used to create liquid Safe markets with up to 2.5M $SAFE used for incentivising $SAFE DEX liquidity on the Gnosis Chain.\n\nAdditionally, the joint treasury will be used to provide liquidity for Safe on Ethereum and Gnosis Chain as well as support the Safe price. Upon potential diversification of the treasury in the future, karpatkey shall also use these assets for staking (ETH / GNO), LPing or other means to gather yield on the assets. Given the initial 100% treasury composition of native tokens (SAFE), karpatkey will provide a more detailed strategy as these become feasible.\n\nThe joint treasury will be included on our [reports page](https://reports.karpatkey.com/), allowing the community to monitor positions and actions taken with the treasury holdings.\n\nTo implement active treasury management and make the delegation effective the current signers, Safe Foundation and Gnosis DAO, will amend the existing joint treasury safe to a 3/6 MS with 2 karpatkey signers, 4 signers to be appointed by the current signers, and a Module Safe controlled by SafeDAO and GnosisDAO which itself will always have full control over the joint treasury. \n\nA corresponding Safe will also be deployed on Gnosis to expand the joint treasury's presence to the chain.\n\n## **Fees**\n\n2% annual fee on assets under management, paid in monthly instalments in either ETH, stablecoins or Safe token at the discretion of karpatkey and what is feasible based on the treasury composition.\n\nFees are calculated as `jointTreasury * 0.02 / 12` at 23:59 UTC on the last day of each month and will be paid from the joint treasury.\n\n## **Duration & Termination**\n\nThis agreement has an indeterminate time duration since it is approved by way of the SafeDAO governance mechanism unless any renegotiation and/or termination of this agreement occurs, always through the governance mechanisms of SafeDAO.\n\nThe SafeDAO may terminate karpatkey DAO’s engagement under this agreement for any reason by way of Governance Mechanism.\n\nkarpatkey DAO may terminate this agreement upon four weeks’ notice posted as a new discussion thread in the SafeDAO forum.\n\nRegular fees will be collected until the day of termination independently of which party made the decision.\n\nEither SafeDAO or karpatkey DAO may at any time terminate this engagement with immediate effect, without previous notification, in any of the following circumstances:\n\na. If the other party incurs a material breach of any of their obligations under this proposal\n\nb. If the other party commits any act of fraud or dishonesty, or acts in a manner which brings or is likely to bring the other party into disrepute or materially affect its interests\n\nc. If the other party becomes unable to pay its debts, admits its inability to pay its debts, enters into administration, becomes insolvent, or enters into a similar arrangement\n\nd. A competent regulator considers the services rendered under this agreement in breach of the law.\n\nkarpatkey DAO will be entitled to terminate this agreement, without previous notification, if the joint treasury fails to make payments for more than 3 consecutive months.\n\n## **Custody of Funds**\n\nkarpatkey DAO is not a custodian of funds. The funds will be in possession of the joint treasury at all times.\n\nLikewise, karpatkey DAO is not responsible for loss of funds caused by the existence, identification and/or exploitation of vulnerabilities through hacks, mining attacks (including double-spend attacks, majority mining power attacks and “selfish-mining” attacks), sophisticated cyber-attacks, distributed denials of service or other security breaches, attacks or deficiencies with smart contracts or protocols which are not owned by SafeDAO or karpatkey DAO.\n\nkarpatkey DAO assumes the risks associated with contractors.\n\nBoth parties have to take their own security measures for the addresses used to make the DeFi transactions to avoid a loss of access.\n\n## **Entire Agreement**\n\na. This Agreement constitutes the entire and exclusive agreement between the Parties regarding its subject matter and supersedes and replaces any previous or contemporaneous written or oral contract, promises, assurances, warranty, representation or understanding regarding its subject matter, whether written, coded or oral.\n\nb. Each Party acknowledges that in entering into this Agreement they do not rely on, and shall have no remedy in respect of, any statement, representation, assurance or warranty (whether made innocently or negligently) that is not set out in this Agreement.\n\nThe plans outlined in this proposal are subject to discussion by the SafeDAO and may need to be (re)structured to take into account legal, regulatory, or technical developments as well as governance considerations. This document should not be taken as the basis for making investment decisions, nor be construed as a recommendation to engage in any transactions.\n\n**About karpatkey**\n\nkarpatkey is a DeFi-native organisation specialising in professional DAO finance through industry-leading research and tooling since 2020.

      "content": "Please refer to the [full proposal text on the SafeDAO forum](https://forum.safe.global/t/sep-23-obra-safe-token-utility-sprint-1/4891). Some parts may have been removed to fit within the character limit on Snapshot.\n\n# Title: \n[SEP #23] Safe Token Utility Sprint 1\n\n# Authors: \n@LuukDAO\n\n# Created: \n**2024-03-19**\n\n# Proposal details\n**Abstract**\nThe Safe Token Utility Sprint 1 is a group of 3 experienced SafeDAO contributors working with tokenomics experts and SafeDAO stakeholders to methodically define and scope the best SAFE Token use cases related to DeFi Modules and staking. The sprint will have three phases: 1. Create an extensive list of Safe token utility options, 2. Organize the options based on resources required to realize and potential to generate value for SAFE. 3. Pick the 5 use cases that score highest and prescribe the required resources to develop and successfully implement these Token utility use cases.\n\nAfter the first Token Utility sprint, we imagine an initial cohort of at least 3 use cases to start the Development and Implementation stage through a follow-up proposal.3\n\n**Aligned Strategy:** 1. Research and implement Safe token utility\n**Funding request:** 50,000 USDC, streamed over 10 weeks with a 4-week cliff.\n**Relation to Strategy budget:** 25%\n\n**Metrics and KPIs**\nWe’ll use the following measurements to track the impact of this initiative on the Strategy:\n\n* Number of token utility options mapped that score at least 3 (out of 4) on resources required to develop and potential to generate value for SAFE in the to-be-produced Token Utility rubric.\n* Quality and detail of requirements for the top use cases, judged by how clearly the market potential and technical specification are worked out.\n\nIf successful, the outcome of this initial sprint can function as the basics for submitting the first Token Utility Development and Implementation phase.\n\n**Initiative Description**\nFollowing [SEP21](https://forum.safe.global/t/draft-safe-token-utility/4802), the SAFE Token Utility Design space has been clarified, and an initial community focus on Canonical DeFi features and SAFE staking connected to the Fee engine (value creation and revenue generation) was set out.\n\nFollowing these priorities, the next step is to complete an initial exploration and prioritize the specification and development of the most promising token utility functionalities.\n\nThis proposal aims to form a Working Group of relevant experts who will spearhead the research and design of 3-5 use cases related to DeFI modules and Staking over 10 weeks.\n\nThis Sprint aims to determine which use cases are most promising (highest return vs lowest costs/risks) and specify what would be needed to build and test the use cases.\n\n**The Sprint would consist of three phases:**\n\n* **Token utility mapping phase:** During this phase, the group will gather existing and new Token utility options through various means, including stakeholder interviews, desk research, and user submission. The team will remove duplicates and spam and create a final overview with options related to DeFi features and Staking.\n**Deliverable:** A clear overview of the potential SAFE token utility options related to key DeFi Features and Staking modules.\n* **Token utility evaluation phase:** During this phase, the Sprint leads and outside experts will score the mapped token utility concepts based on the time and resources required to implement them and their potential to generate and capture value.\n**Deliverable:** A selection of the most promising 5 use cases, a breakdown of why each was selected, and what will have to be determined/validated during the specification phase.\n* **Top utility specification phase:** The group will drill down further into the most promising use cases. Additional market research, validation, and interviews with experts and users will be conducted to allow for further prioritization. In parallel, the Sprint team will do technical research and specification to reduce technological uncertainty and confirm the assumptions around resources required to develop and implement the token utility use case.\n**Deliverable:** A detailed specification of the most promising 5 token utility use cases related to Staking and/or DeFi features that provide sufficient clarity for builders groups to apply for an OBRA budget to develop and implement each token utility function.\n\n**Projected workload**\nThe sprint’s Core group is projected to contribute a combined workload of ~40 hours a week for the full sprint duration (10 weeks). Each hour the Sprint team contributes is compensated with ~125 USDC, below standard for Senior blockchain strategists/analysts for projects of this size.\n\nAny future SAFE rewards, if received, will be distributed to Core group members and experts who provided input through a to-be-determined methodology by the Core sprint group.\n\n**Current Status**\nThis initiative builds on SEP #21, providing the context for Token Utility. Two priority areas have been identified. Each working group member has contributed to Safe Token Utility through the forum; however, the group has not worked together as a unit.\n\n**Risks of the Initiative**\nBelow are the identified risks and how we mitigate them.\n\n1. Gathering sufficient stakeholder and expert input: Forming a working group might limit the input and implementation from potential stakeholders and expert input that might need to be sufficiently involved. To mitigate this risk, the working group will actively chase input and provide multiple points for feedback #buildinpublic.\n2. Mismatch with core business elements: ​The token utility sprint should consider all business elements when shaping its design, including regulatory requirements, technical feasibility, and viable models that are acceptable to prospective users. The working group will work closely with crucial SafeDAO stakeholders to ensure alignment.\n\n**Timeline and milestones**\n\n|Milestone|Description|Duration|\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|1. Create an initial directory of SAFE token utility options.|Gather existing and new Token utility options through various means, including stakeholder interviews, desk research, and user submission. Remove duplicates/spam and create a final overview.|3 Weeks|\n|2. Organize the options based on resources required to realize and potential to generate value for SAFE.|Coordinate with token experts and safe builders to determine the value creation potential and difficulty of rolling out each mapped use case.|3 Weeks|\n|3. Test market assumptions and describe requirements for the top 3-5 use cases.|Pick the top 5 use cases and drill deeper to validate revenue potential and roll-out assumptions. Create an initial specification for the specific use case that can function as the foundation for a follow-up proposal by a building entity to develop and implement the use case.|4 Weeks|\n\n**Initiative lead**\nLuukDAO (@LuukDAO): An existing Safe Delegate, former DeFi Fund Manager, and founder of Kolektivo Labs with 7+ years of experience in the Web3 space. Luuk will function as a researcher and project manager to ensure the timely and successful delivery of the initiative.\n\nAlex (@espina): Research at Gnosis Guild. Alex has ample experience with the Safe ecosystem and protocol architecture, having contributed to our work on modular infrastructure for smart accounts. Alex brings a deep technical understanding and direct connection to the Gnosis Guild team to fact-check technical evaluations.\n\nLavi (@Lavi): An experienced DeFi analyst/researcher. Lavi previously led projects and teams at Index Coop, Prime Rating, and Llama Risk. He is active in the Digital Asset space in Switzerland and beyond. Lavi brings relevant business and tokenomics experiences and 4+ years of structured DeFi research experience.\n\n**Team**\nThe Core Working group will collaborate with a wide range of stakeholders to validate our market assumption and technical estimations:\n\n* Tokenomics experts to validate and model token flow assumptions\n* Market experts and existing users to validate our revenue assumption\n* Safe experts to confirm our technical estimations are correct and applicable.\n\nThe Sprint will be executed publicly, sharing progress every two weeks and requesting wider stakeholder and community input.\n\n**Budget Notes**\nNo up-front capital is required. Rewards will be streamed for 10 weeks following a 4-week cliff. The Safe Tokenomics Working Group will manage all resources in a 2 out of 3 Safe Wallet and allocate them based on internal agreement within the Working Group.\n\nWe request that the Safe Ecosystem Foundation (SEF) provide us with a point of contact (Steven) who will coordinate between the working group and the SEF to ensure that all prioritized Token Utility aligns with the SEF’s technical and legal resources.",

Unvested tokens would remain in the vesting contract and thus would not become transferable after unpausing the SAFE token.\n\nDue to safeguards in place, the earliest possible date for the SAFE token to become transferable is eight days after the voting period ends, tentatively Tuesday, 23 April 2024.\n\nThis proposal is a direct follow-up on completing all milestones established in [SEP #3 ](https://snapshot.org/#/safe.eth/proposal/0xdcd7f8cb197c7132296d802e538df2a565fbe4f8af400f1afbed06b54a808060) Towards clarity on milestones before voting on enabling transferability again.\n\n# Proposal types\n\nState which proposal type this proposal belongs to.\n\n- [ ] SEP: Constitutional Proposals\n- [ ] SEP: Governance Proposals\n- [X] Other SEPs\n\n\n\n# Proposal details\n\n**Purpose and Background**\nWhen the SAFE token was launched in September 2022, it was non-transferable, with SafeDAO governance in control of the unpause function in the token contract that could make SAFE transferable.\n\nAn initial SafeDAO proposal ([SEP #2](https://forum.safe.global/t/sep-2-community-initiative-to-unpause-token-contract-enabling-transferability/1131/11)) to call the unpause function to make the SAFE token transferable was [submitted in November 2022](https://snapshot.org/#/safe.eth/proposal/0x1b48a83c44e323275a605b244a05bde89918fb9ec86be7bb83792eb26e544441). SafeDAO governance voted against (73.63% no votes) making the token transferable, as many stakeholders felt there was a need for more clarity about the function of the token and operations of SafeDAO.\n\nAfter the denial of SEP #2, SAFE stakeholders defined milestones that should be met before Token transferability is again put up for a vote. [SEP #3 ](https://snapshot.org/#/safe.eth/proposal/0xdcd7f8cb197c7132296d802e538df2a565fbe4f8af400f1afbed06b54a808060) was submitted and passed in December 2022 (58,28% votes out of three options), ratifying a list of five milestones that SafeDAO Governance agreed must be met before SAFE transferability is put up for a vote again.\n\nThe final milestone was met on March 18th, 2024, with the passing of [SEP #21 ](https://snapshot.org/#/safe.eth/proposal/0x1d65ca5270b4aa1efaa7b7ca4e17976a99b802efcf678ac2909eb836b1662a29). As such, SAFE transferability can be voted on again.\n\nThis proposal aims to call the unpause method of the token contract (using the SafeSnap module), which would make the SAFE token transferable following the successful completion of all milestones established in SEP #3.\n\n**Overview of Milestones**\nAn overview of Milestones defined in [SEP #3 ](https://snapshot.org/#/safe.eth/proposal/0xdcd7f8cb197c7132296d802e538df2a565fbe4f8af400f1afbed06b54a808060) and proof of completion is provided below.\n\n|Milestone|Completion|\n| --- | --- |\n|A.

It will also expose SafeDAO to new market forces and responsibilities, as the SAFE token will become liquid and thereby increase its utility.\n\nAnother key part of having a transferable token is strengthening token utility as outlined in the recent token utility proposal [[SEP #21] SAFE Token Utility ](https://forum.safe.global/t/sep-21-safe-token-utility/4802). In the short term, SAFE transferability will enhance the day-1 utility of the Safe Activity Program.\n\nAdditionally, it enables outside contributors to participate in Safe Governance’s voting mechanisms, which supports Safe’s ecosystem growth. In that regard, a more diverse holder base will also contribute to a more decentralized governance infrastructure.\n\nOnce the token contract is unpaused (and therefore, the token is transferable), it is impossible to pause it again (e.g., once transferable, forever transferable).\n\nRegardless, the benefits of having a transferable token and the ability to use it to grow SafeDAO and generalize value likely outweigh the costs of transferability.\n\n**Alternative Solutions**\nThe main alternative is to not put SAFE token transferability up for a vote; however, based on the significant majority votes on each milestone (each proposal having at least 96.41% yes votes), there is sufficient reason to assume stakeholders want to vote on SAFE token transferability again.\n\n**Implementation**\nNo significant additional code is required to make the token transferable.\n\nA 3-day (259200 seconds) SafeSnap/Reality timeout period begins if the proposal successfully passes. During this period, anyone can request the execution of this proposal and set an outcome, provided they have posted the required bond.\n\nUnless the outcome is challenged within this timeout period, the outcome is finalized, and the 5-day ([432000 seconds](https://app.safe.global/apps/open?safe=eth:0x8CF60B289f8d31F737049B590b5E4285Ff0Bd1D1&appUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fzodiac.gnosisguild.org%2F)) cooldown period starts. Once the cooldown period has ended, there is a time window of 7 days ([604800 seconds](https://app.safe.global/apps/open?safe=eth:0x8CF60B289f8d31F737049B590b5E4285Ff0Bd1D1&appUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fzodiac.gnosisguild.org%2F)), the answer expiration period, during which the outcome can be executed as a transaction by anyone.\n\nThe token will become transferable no earlier than eight days after the voting period ends. Since the voting period ends on Monday, 15 April 2024, the earliest possible date for the token to become transferable is Tuesday, 23 April 2024.\n\n**Payload breakdown**\nUsing the enabled Reality module (`eth:0x4ECeFC422c98a096eD8b56EaD67477c4B6e8702b`), the SAFE token controller (`eth: 0x8CF60B289f8d31F737049B590b5E4285Ff0Bd1D1`) will first remove the three airdrop modules made redundant by this proposal (`eth:0xC0fde70A65C7569Fe919bE57492228DEE8cDb585`, `eth:0x29067F28306419923BCfF96E37F95E0f58ABdBBe`, and `eth:0xA0b937D5c8E32a80E3a8ed4227CD020221544ee6`), and will then call the `unpause()` function on the Safe token contract (`0x5aFE3855358E112B5647B952709E6165e1c1eEEe`).\n\nThe payload is [simulated here.](https://dashboard.tenderly.co/public/safe/safe-apps/simulator/90fa9f95-78ed-4bee-96fd-2953c9d63e27)\n\n**Disclaimer**\nThe tx payload and other details of this proposal are still in review and open for further SafeDAO stakeholder input. There is no guarantee that the final proposal will include any of the details written in this document. Consider this a working draft until passed by SafeDAO governance.\n\n**Copyright**\nCopyright and related rights waived via CC0.",

      "content": "### Title: [SEP #21] SAFE Token Utility\n\n### Authors: Lukas Schor (Safe, @Lukas) , Steven Biekens (Safe, @Steven)\n\n### Created: **2024-02-13**\n\nPlease refer to the full proposal text on the SafeDAO forum. Some parts needed to be removed to fit within the character limit on Snapshot:​​ https://forum.safe.global/t/sep-21-safe-token-utility/4802\n\n### Abstract\n\nThis proposal outlines strategies to enhance the utility of the SAFE token (“SAFE token” or “SAFE”), inspired by [ideas from the Safe community](https://forum.safe.global/t/exploring-the-safe-token-call-for-input-submissions/3952). The ratification of this SEP completes milestone E as specified under [SEP #3](https://snapshot.org/#/safe.eth/proposal/0xdcd7f8cb197c7132296d802e538df2a565fbe4f8af400f1afbed06b54a808060) (“Towards clarity on milestones before voting on enabling transferability again”). It also plans for future token utility expansions, emphasizing community involvement in the further development of the SAFE token utility.\n\n### Proposal types\n\nState which proposal type this proposal belongs to.\n\n[] SEP: Constitutional Proposals\n\n[ ] SEP: Governance Proposals\n\n[X] Other SEPs\n\n\n### Proposal details\n\nThis proposal outlines suggestions to expand the utility of the SAFE token. The token utility ideas that were collected from the [Safe community](https://forum.safe.global/t/exploring-the-safe-token-call-for-input-submissions/3952) served as a key input for this proposal.\n\n\n\n## Token Utility Design Space\n\nThis section examines the primary goals and guiding principles that shape the utility of the SAFE token, ensuring strategic alignment with the Safe ecosystem's overarching objectives.\n\n### SafeDAO Constitution / OBRA\n\nSafe enables users to own their digital assets in a secure, convenient and interactive way, which will require smart accounts (also known as smart contract wallets) to become the default in web3. This is also reflected in the mission outlined in the SafeDAO Constitution:\n\n“SafeDAO’s mission is to establish smart contract wallets as the default means for interacting with web3 [...] As SafeDAO, we aspire to work towards this mission by establishing standards for composable smart contract wallets (the “Safe Protocol”).” (SafeDAO Constitution, “2. Mission”)\n\nThe [SafeDAO Constitution](https://snapshot.org/#/safe.eth/proposal/0xbb71846f7fdfdd31033bde9cf25c880b46d50d1dda75cbf653d6a94318f96290) further bases this mission on three strategic pillars / goals that impact the SAFE token utility:\n\n* **Foster a vibrant ecosystem:** The SAFE token should benefit from a vibrant ecosystem, rather than a single product. Additionally, principle 2 of the SafeDAO Constitution states that any utility of SAFE should directly or indirectly add value to the Safe ecosystem. Furthermore, changes to token mechanisms need to consider the effects on different stakeholders including users, developers and token holders.\n* **Resilience through decentralization:** The SAFE token can be used to achieve technical / economical / governance decentralization for critical components in the Safe ecosystem.\n* **Tokenize value:** Mechanisms should be created to link the growth of the Safe ecosystem to the growth in utility of SAFE.\n\n**OBRA:** The resource allocation framework [OBRA](https://snapshot.org/#/safe.eth/proposal/0x0dc074ccf35bdac8fc84da3c0c089b3e947e23eeca362564cd729aa440e2a267) derives strategies and initiatives from the above goals and establishes processes for resource allocation. While not impacting the token utility design space directly, OBRA needs to be considered for funding future explorations and implementations of token utility.\n \n![4b6ba47ee79766575defb028ad271c22d8aa1a95_2_1248x702.jpg](ipfs://bafkreid3fi5qe2eciqi3h5uswlg2narc2szhhyjtbdsewbmwjdr2f44sgu)\n    \n\n### Strategic focus\n\nThe Safe Smart Account has become a trusted infrastructure in the web3 ecosystem, currently securing over [$100bn in assets](https://dune.com/safe/all). Given the broad potential applications for the SAFE token, this section suggests a strategic direction and guidelines for developing and integrating token utilities, aligned with SafeDAO's mission. This strategic focus serves as guidelines for future explorations and implementations of token utilities and the respective growth of the Safe ecosystem.\n\nAny explorations of token utility should be merely seen as preliminary conceptual ideas, which are likely to be subject to substantial change, as token utilities could also be explored beyond the ones mentioned in this SEP as long as they fall into the SAFE token utility design space defined below. There is NO guarantee and NO warranty that any of the mentioned utilities are being explored and/or being implemented in the future.\n\nAt the core of this strategy is Account Abstraction, the foundation enabling smart contract-based accounts. For smart accounts to become a mainstream option, they must offer clear, tangible advantages to both developers and users. These benefits will be facilitated by the Safe Core Protocol, encompassing different ‘abstraction layers’. These abstraction layers can be implemented separately but will eventually be strongly interconnected.\n\n \n![photo_2024-03-05_10-40-31.jpg](ipfs://bafybeictu7txkvw2cuq3v4uusu3dvpxs7f4lhs2ysbi7on6gqx4bjkqp3a)\n    \n\n**1. Account Abstraction (“Smart Accounts”)**\n\nAccount abstraction is the basis for enabling smart accounts to interact with web3 applications. Initiatives such as [ERC-4337](https://www.erc4337.io/) empower and standardize smart accounts, enabling new use-cases such as [passkey-controlled accounts](https://ethresear.ch/t/passkey-based-account-abstraction-signer-for-smart-contract-wallets/15856), [recovery schemes](https://safe.mirror.xyz/WxKSxD9J1bRI-SDOuDvAAIezwVrvWWkpuwuzcLDPSmk), or [seedless onboarding](https://safe.mirror.xyz/pyf0meKAyooY1v8GB7z6Ik7o4wPHGTyCOcUf--UU-IA). However, account abstraction itself is only a first step towards achieving mainstream adoption of smart accounts. Additional challenges have to be solved to fully unlock the potential of advanced security, payment and network properties of smart accounts.\n\n**2. Network Abstraction (“Smart Link”)**\n\nThe Network Abstraction Layer aims to simplify the fragmented blockchain network landscape, enabling a seamless experience across different chains. This layer introduces a framework that significantly enhances cross-chain functionality, fostering a more interconnected ecosystem. An example of this abstraction layer is the ability of a Safe Smart Account to control assets on multiple chains and make cross-chain interactions (see also the [discussion](https://forum.safe.global/t/how-can-a-safe-hold-asset-on-multiple-chains/2242) on the community forum).\n\n**3. Username Abstraction (“Smart Domains”)**\n\nUsername Abstraction offers an intuitive way to navigate the blockchain's complexity by replacing cryptic blockchain addresses with human-readable names, combining existing solutions like ENS (SafeDAO holds [safe.eth](https://app.ens.domains/safe.eth)) with smart contract wallets (e.g. leveraging solutions like [Nameverse](https://nameverse.org/) or similar). The SAFE token could potentially be used to e.g. claim usernames on a designated namespace. This abstraction layer not only enhances user experience but also paves the way for new economic models based on domain registrations or renewals (Some discussions were held on the community forum on this topic, including this [thread](https://forum.safe.global/t/enable-same-safe-address-across-all-chains/3632)).\n\n**4. Payment Abstraction (“Fee Engine”)**\nTraditional payment functionalities, such as recurring payments and subscription models, are still underutilized in the web3 space. The objective of payment abstraction is to bridge the gap between conventional payment systems and the evolving web3 payment infrastructure and enable economic sustainability for the Safe ecosystem. An initial proposal for payment abstraction is the [Fee Engine](https://forum.safe.global/t/smart-account-fee-engine-s-a-f-e/4432). The SAFE token could potentially play a role around the concept of a payment splitter (suggested by @varunkcs). Additionally, the proposal also outlines the concept of an [Ecosystem Contribution](https://forum.safe.global/t/smart-account-fee-engine-s-a-f-e/), which allows to support community-driven initiatives within the Safe ecosystem via SAFE token governance.\n\n**5. Security Abstraction (“Registry”)**\nSmart accounts enable opportunities to create new onchain security primitives that protect users. One example is the introduction of registries (e.g. by leveraging [Rhinestone](https://www.rhinestone.wtf/), [ZenGuard](https://zenguard.xyz/) or similar solutions) as a way to establish stronger security properties and enforce standards for smart account modules. An initial architecture can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/safe-global/safe-core-protocol-specs). On the SAFE token’s role, [several ideas](https://forum.safe.global/t/exploring-the-safe-token-call-for-input-submissions/3952) were put forward by the community (@CryptoEconLab, @varunkcs and @Abraxas, @LongHash_Ventures and @LuukDAO). Examples include mechanisms around the curation on a module registry, or a “security module” that acts as a protocol-native insurance.\n\n**Future Abstraction Layers**\nThere may be additional abstraction layers that become relevant for the Safe Core Protocol. This may include privacy abstraction, such as adopting a [UTXO model](https://hackmd.io/@SamWilsn/B1c0ZdaGP) or stealth addresses (as suggested [here](https://forum.safe.global/t/stealth-addresses-for-safes/3759)), or compliance abstraction that enables privacy without sacrificing on compliance. Generally, the Safe Core Protocol aims to enshrine components where the value of standardization is higher than the value of heterogeneity.\n\n![photo_2024-03-05_10-40-41.jpg](ipfs://bafkreid5bmyrrsnmc66eoyl2qvpqgf4uo3nmett6k62n2lyewmoqjyejaq)\n    \n\n### Out of scope\n\nThe SAFE token utility should intentionally not be part of the [Safe Smart Account](https://github.com/safe-global/safe-smart-account) itself. Having the SAFE token be a requirement for developers using the Safe Smart Account may hinder its adoption or even lead to forks. This can negatively impact the ecosystem consistency as well as inclination of certain developers to adopt Safe Smart Accounts in their solutions. Having a commitment from the SafeDAO to keep the base smart account functionality independent from the SAFE token allows for a more aligned ecosystem to be built around the Safe Smart Account. This allows the ecosystem as a whole to become more valuable, which will ultimately benefit other layers of the stack such as the Safe Core Protocol.\n\n# Existing & Proposed Token Utility\n\nThis section lays out a proposal, to be ratified by the SafeDAO, on the SAFE token utility as well as potential opportunities for future explorations of additional utilities.\n\n## a. Existing Utility: Governance\n\nSafeDAO is governed using the SAFE token (see [SafeDAO Constitution](https://snapshot.org/#/safe.eth/proposal/0xbb71846f7fdfdd31033bde9cf25c880b46d50d1dda75cbf653d6a94318f96290)). Governance should remain a key utility of the SAFE token, which was also indicated by the community (see for example [token utility proposals](https://forum.safe.global/t/exploring-the-safe-token-call-for-input-submissions/3952) from @varunkcs @LuukDAO around the votings on the allocation of resources, including grants).\n\nSAFE token holders can vote within the scope of governance of SafeDAO. They can vote with their vested and unvested tokens and delegate their voting power.\n\nThe following domains are part of the governance of SafeDAO (for more details on the scope of governance see Section C of [the Governance Framework](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iDlSEGld-Gu81FwrC0GXtqLK5J7ETzyOhkWJu51TpAw/edit#heading=h.laiwvcu28446)):\n\n* **Constitution** (see [SEP #4](https://snapshot.org/#/safe.eth/proposal/0xbb71846f7fdfdd31033bde9cf25c880b46d50d1dda75cbf653d6a94318f96290))\n* **Governance framework:** This encompasses the scope of governance, dynamic governance, decision-making process and principles of proposal implementation (see [SEP #7](https://snapshot.org/#/safe.eth/proposal/0x71bf4469fc289bab2d8ce99ba41d5792c1c5d581defc12042d3cf1eb3e136323))\n* **Resource allocation framework** (see [SEP #8](https://snapshot.org/#/safe.eth/proposal/0x0dc074ccf35bdac8fc84da3c0c089b3e947e23eeca362564cd729aa440e2a267))\n* **Assets held for SafeDAO** (see “Treasury” in the [Governance Hub](http://gov.safe.global))\n  * SafeDAO Treasury and joint SafeDAO/GnosisDAO Treasury\n  * Certain IP rights: ENS domain, NFTs etc.\n* **Safe Grants Program** with funding and administrative support provided by SEF (see [SEP #6](https://snapshot.org/#/safe.eth/proposal/0xf155919e4a0354adee44860cd9a135075ac54fc146437d6c63850a64469963ef))\n\n* **SEF governance signaling**: Suggestion (“social signaling”) regarding the establishment and composition of DAO committees, once established by the Foundation\n* **Unpausing of SAFE token transferability** (see [SEP #2](https://snapshot.org/#/safe.eth/proposal/0x1b48a83c44e323275a605b244a05bde89918fb9ec86be7bb83792eb26e544441))\n* **Safe{Core} Protocol**: Parameters and other governance-related aspects, once they have been transferred to the governance of SafeDAO\n\n## b. Proposed Utility / Use Case: Safe Activity Program\n\nThis proposal introduces the Safe Activity Program, which incentivizes Safe users to actively participate and contribute to the Safe ecosystem (both onchain and offchain activity that is deemed valuable could potentially be considered, but also depends on factors such as technical feasibility). By actively using the Safe Smart Account, users participating in the Safe Activity Program display dedication to the long-term success of Safe. In return, these users become eligible for discretionary activity rewards, such as additional functionality, discounts, or other benefits. The Safe Activity Program would be designed to benefit and involve the entire Safe ecosystem.\n\nThe exact scope of the activity rewards will have to be worked out. But rewards could consist of for example:\n\n* **Sponsored transactions:** Ability to send a limited amount of free transactions\n* **Season NFTs:** Ability to claim (Safe-bound) NFT for each governance season, enabling additional perks such as guaranteed access to key events such as Safe{Con}\n* **SAFE tokens:** SAFE tokens would be distributed to participating users that are active with their Safe Smart Account\n\nThe SAFE token gets an additional activity related use-case as part of the proposed Safe Activity Program. Locking SAFE can boost/multiply the rewards the participants receive from their activity in the Safe ecosystem.\n\nAny SAFE tokens that eligible users would be able to claim will be funded from the remaining user allocation. This discretional Safe Activity Program would run over a limited time of up to 6 months, afterwards it will be revisited for potential extension by the Safe Ecosystem Foundation. This allocation serves a two-fold purpose:\n\n**1. Expand the number of token holders:** The Safe Activity Program increases the token allocation of each participating user. By providing additional utility, the Safe Activity Program should attract more stakeholders who do not currently hold a SAFE token and are active Safe users.\n**2. Strengthen the user allocation for active users:** Offering Safe Activity Program rewards benefits all active Safe users. This gives each user the opportunity to individually influence their allocation relative to others through activity.\n\nThe initial Safe Activity Program rewards already provide various benefits for active token holders participating in the Safe Activity Program. The program should also help bootstrapping the adoption of the SAFE token. However, it is designed as a composable mechanism that can be adapted or expanded over time through future community initiatives, such as expanding the program to networks beyond Ethereum L1.\n\n## c. Community Involvement\n\nThis SEP should be seen as a first step / foundation for ratifying and exploring the token utility of SAFE. As the Safe{Core} Protocol evolves over time, the design space of utilities for the SAFE token will naturally expand.\n\n### Initial Feedback\nBelow summarizes some early themes identified from community feedback on the proposal, as posted on the [SafeDAO forum](https://forum.safe.global/t/discussion-safe-token-utility/4743) and discussed during a [community call](https://safe-global.notion.site/Governance-Call-Token-Utility-SEP-2nd-call-1d4aa270937449168ac4d92dee59a4c9?pvs=4). They narrow down the strategic focus into more concrete ways how the SAFE token can obtain additional utilities. A thorough analysis is required to take into account legal, regulatory, technical and feasibility considerations before any implementation. Any explorations of token utility should be merely seen as preliminary conceptual ideas, which are likely to be subject to substantial change, as token utilities could also be explored beyond the ones mentioned in this SEP as long as they fall into the SAFE token utility design space defined above. There is NO guarantee and NO warranty that any of the mentioned utilities are being explored and/or being implemented in the future.\n\n**Canonical DeFi features / modules**\nAn area to explore is use cases that link DeFi modules to SafeDAO. Currently there are [over $100bn in assets](https://dune.com/safe/all) stored on Safes, and DeFi modules could enable asset owners to use their assets more productively. Potential examples include canonical swap, stake, bridge, stablecoin or flashloan modules. Through those modules, the abundant liquidity could be tapped into by others, and an Ecosystem Contribution similar to the one proposed in the [Fee Engine](https://forum.safe.global/t/smart-account-fee-engine-s-a-f-e/) link back to SafeDAO.\n\n \n![photo_2024-03-05_10-40-49 (2).jpg](ipfs://bafkreighgs4fulyo3rl7r6x352up77tddqel4nwec5zp3nyf6erjybyvau)\n    \n\n**SAFE Staking**\nThis idea suggests that the proposed activity program for the Safe ecosystem, which involves locking SAFE tokens, could potentially evolve into a form of staking. As the abstraction layers are being built out, different components will have the need for economic security to be provided through staking mechanisms. This could allow SAFE token holders to engage in various staking opportunities as they develop within the ecosystem. A framework could be developed which, similar to restaking, enables SAFE holders to choose among different staking mechanisms, possibly even simultaneously participating in different security models. The different available staking mechanisms could be governed by SafeDAO via an onchain registry, ensuring that they are aligned with SafeDAO's interest and security standards.\n \n![photo_2024-03-05_10-40-54.jpg](ipfs://bafkreib3uywfmaumehhldn7j5rp7qavvezfx3kznuy7ndsonltn7ah6chi)\n    \n**Fee engine**\nSeveral community members highlighted the “fee engine” as an initial concept that should be prioritized and iterated on. In this respect, it is important to determine which products and services the market is willing to pay for. Another aspect is to balance fees (determine what should remain free/affordable and what a fair market rate could be).",

We envision a minimal protocol fee may be a good approach to support this in later versions.\n\nWe’re not sure what the long-term fee model looks like yet, but charging services fees with existing customers in the short term has been helping us 1) understand the level of value we are delivering, and 2) ensure partners have skin in the game while we invest large amounts of time and energy into manual implementation work.\n\n\n### Relation to budget\n\n6.6%\n\n### Abstract\n\nThis initiative will increase transparency of the Guardian role by providing SafeDAO with an onchain source of truth via Hats Protocol, the onchain roles protocol. Hats Protocol enables DAOs to programmatically create and manage contributor roles, responsibilities, and permissions. Through this implementation, SafeDAO will be able to formalize the Guardian role onchain, automate the granting and revocation of role-specific permissions based on desired eligibility criteria (e.g., allowlist, election results, token holdings, staking requirements, etc.), and automate the expiration of the role after a specified term limit. As a result, this initiative will save SafeDAO resources by automating time-consuming community management tasks, increase decentralization by minimizing trusted actions and disintermediating human managers, and reduce wasted motion by simplifying Guardian onboarding and offboarding. \n\nThe implementation will be conducted by Haberdasher Labs, the founding team of Hats Protocol and the Hats front-end interface, in collaboration with the SafeDAO governance team. Hats Protocol is non-upgradeable, immutable, unowned, and permissionless. The foundational tech stack (core protocol, peripheral contracts, subgraphs, and SDKs) are fully open source. The protocol has received and passed two robust, formal audits by leading security experts.",

Safe has done tremendous work to promote modular smart accounts by enabling features such as Spend limits and Recovery on the Safe Wallet. We believe this is just the tip of the iceberg. To foster modular Safe Accounts and promote more developers to build secure and usable modules that can be trusted, we propose a platform built on the  [Safe{Core} Protocol](https://docs.safe.global/safe-core-protocol/safe-core-protocol) that allows developers to build and publish modules, streamlining the development process and risk assessment via on-chain audit verification. Additionally, providing a Module marketplace for users to easily explore and enable these modules. This initiative's overall vision is to bring developers to build diverse modules that can be audited and provide on-chain security verification so that all kinds of Safe Account users can enhance their account features securely.",

It determines which OBRA initiatives can get funded within the budget of an OBRA strategy:\n  - 1. Approval voting: Participants allocate their voting power to express approval ('Yes') or disapproval ('No') for each proposed project. This phase determines which projects have the majority support based on the accumulated weighted 'Yes' votes.\n  - 2. Sequential Ranking: Projects that received a majority of 'Yes' votes are then ranked according to the total voting power in favor of them. \n \nFunding is then allocated to the projects in the order of their ranking, up to the point where the budget limit of the specific strategy is reached. Projects ranked below the budget cutoff point can be funded (if available) partially by the remaining budget of the relevant strategy and the remaining amount of the wildcard strategy. Initiatives applying directly for the wildcard strategy and initiatives that would exceed the budget of a different strategy are ranked in the same category. This method ensures that only the most favored and viable projects, as determined by voter approval and ranking, are funded within the constraints of the available budget.\n\n| **Original** | **New** |\n|---|---|\n| E.

What are the pros and cons? What are risks?\n\nThe proposed amendments collectively aim to streamline SafeDAO’s governance process, making it more efficient and responsive to individual circumstances. By introducing mechanisms such as partial delegation, extension of voting mechanisms, and a revised voting mechanism for OBRA initiatives, the governance framework becomes more adaptable and capable of reflecting more granular interests of its members. Further, these amendments will result in lowering barriers to participation and encouraging a broader section of the community to engage in SafeDAO governance.\n\nThe main risks are that amendments in nuanced voting processes or delegation models can increase the complexity of participation for SafeDAO members, potentially making it more difficult to engage in governance, and that executing the amendments may increase the burden on the technical implementation side. However, we believe that we can mitigate this by maintaining our focus on educating our members and by recognizing that the advantages outweigh these risks.\n\n\n***Alternative Solutions***\n\nWhat alternative solutions have been considered? Why have they been discarded?\n\nAn alternative solution is to not change the governance framework. While this is possible, it would mean not incorporating our learnings into the optimization of governance, which we aim to do continuously. This approach wouldn't necessarily present a major blocker, but it could slow down our pace of progression.\n\n***Implementation***\n\nDoes the implementation of the proposal require new code? How is the security of the code ensured? How is the implementation of the proposal carried out?\n\n[X] Own implementation possible\n\n[] Own implementation but with funding (how much % to implementation)\n\n[] Request for technical support through Safe matter experts:\n\n* Who is needed?\n\n* Did you reach out?\n\n* Is there a roadmap?\n\n**Open Questions**\n\nAnything that needs to be cleared up before the community can make an informed decision?\n\nNone\n\n**Acknowledgements\n\nSpecial thanks to @Lindsey (Hedgey), @auryn (Gnosis Guild) and @adamhurwitz.eth for their contributions and feedback.\n\n**Copyright**\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via CC0.",

Some parts needed to be removed to fit within the character limit on Snapshot:​​ https://forum.safe.global/t/sep-10-obra-strategies-and-budget/4459  ​\n\n**Abstract**\n\nThis proposal outlines five strategies and a wildcard strategy under OBRA with their respective budgets, which are aimed at pushing forward the goals in the SafeDAO constitution.\n\n**Proposal types**\n\nState which proposal type this proposal belongs to.\n\n[X] SEP: Resource allocation strategies\n\n[X] SEP: Resource allocation budget\n\n**Proposal details**\n\nThe overall budget mentioned here is for Season 1 and Season 2 according to the governance framework and OBRA. The budget acts as an upper threshold, allowing any unspent amount to be carried over to the next season.\n\n\n### Strategy 1: Research and implement Safe token utility\n\n**1. Which goals does the strategy look to drive progress in?**\n\nTokenize value (Goal 3): SAFE should represent the value of the Safe Ecosystem. Mechanisms should be created to link the growth of the Safe Ecosystem to the growth in utility of SAFE.\n\n**2. Which metrics and KPIs could initiatives under this strategy be measured against?**\n\n*Disclaimer: KPIs should always be considered in relation to each other and not in isolation. For instance, the number of token utility contributions should be evaluated in conjunction with their quality. We would always prefer two high-quality contributions over five low-quality ones.*\n\n* Quality level of token utility contributions (via individual assessment)\n\n* Specific Token Utility Participation Rate\n\n* Increase in activity regarding utility\n\n**3. Outline the execution strategy or thesis**\n\nThis is just an overview to give guidance on how to develop further token utility use cases:\n\n1. Research phase: Conduct comprehensive market research to understand current token utilities in the market.\n\n2. Development phase: Create use cases for Safe Token, focusing on user and developer value proposition and ecosystem growth.\n\n3. Implementation and iteration phase: Gradually roll out new utilities, monitoring user adoption and feedback.\n\n**4. What are some example initiatives that would fall under this strategy**\n\n*Disclaimer: The initiatives mentioned below are just examples for discussion and should not be taken as confirmation of their actual implementation.*\n\n1. Locking mechanisms: Implement locking mechanisms to reward long-term holders.\n\n2. Governance participation: Utilize Safe tokens for voting on resource allocation and product governance.\n\n**5. Detail around existing data or evidence to support this thesis**\n\n* Arbitrum (ARB): Functions as a governance token, allowing holders to vote on network upgrades. While it's not possible to directly attribute the growth to token utility, following the token launch, the active user base increased by 44% from 1.8m to 2.6m in three months. The number of token holders increased by 112% from 285k to 604k, showing a steady ecosystem growth.\n\n* Optimism (OP): Primarily used for governance, transaction fees, and to incentivise network and user engagement. Token launch allowed the protocol to increase the number of active addresses by 166% from 138k to 368k per month.\n\n* Polkadot (DOT): Utility involves governance, staking for network security, and locking DOT for parachain slot auctions to support ecosystem development and growth. The total volume of staked reached 663m in 23Q3, showcasing a strong token utility.\n\n**6. Detail around any risks associated with this strategy**\n\n* Low user adoption: Risk of low engagement or adoption of new token utilities through misaligned token utility or overly complex utility.\n\n* Market conditions: Potential impact on usage of token.\n\n* Legal and regulatory constraints: Compliance with crypto regulations.\n\n**7. If this strategy succeeds, what is the happy case?**\n\nTangible, applicable models for token utility and strong community engagement with higher participation rates in governance\n\n**8. If this strategy fails, what would be some reasons?**\n\n\"Random\" collection of token utilities / not tailored to SAFE / not feasible\n\n**9. Assessment of the strategy’s maturity and if there is additional data that needs to be collected for the validation of this strategy**\n\n* The strategy is designed to be less mature and more experimental, reflecting the research mission's nature (exploring what constitutes effective token utility) and the methodology for achieving impactful outcomes (we encourage various approaches to reach an outcome).\n\n* Implementing a supportive legal framework to pre-vet token utilities could add significant value to keep contributions efficient and prevent non-regulatory compliant ones.\n\n**10. What budget should this strategy be allocated for?**\n\n*Disclaimer: Please be aware that the final numbers might change based on the market price of the stablecoin allocation proposal.*\n\n200.000 USDC\n\n____\n\n### Strategy 2: Foster module ecosystem\n\n**1. Which goals does the strategy look to drive progress in?**\n\nFoster vibrant ecosystem (Goal 1): SafeDAO benefits from a vibrant ecosystem built on shared components and standards. SafeDAO supports and empowers new and existing projects integrating with the Safe Protocol or initiatives supporting the usage of Safe Protocol.\n\n**2. Which metrics and KPIs could initiatives under this strategy be measured against?**\n\n*Disclaimer: KPIs should always be considered in relation to each other and not in isolation. For instance, the number of modules developed should be evaluated in conjunction with their quality. We would always prefer two high-quality contributions over five low-quality ones.*\n\n* Quality level of proposed modules (via individual assessment)\n\n* Usage of modules, e.g. value driven through modules / transaction volume / number activation / percentage of Safes with modules activated\n\n* Integration of modules (actual traction and individually assessed via former cases/benchmarks)\n\n* Developer satisfaction score (for improvements, via rating mechanism)\n\n**3. Outline the execution strategy or thesis**\n\nDevelopers are encouraged to create new modules focusing on new use cases, robust implementation, and thorough auditing. Creation of libraries and further developer tooling. Execution should have a strong emphasis on boosting the security of the module ecosystem, possibly through sponsored auditing. Prioritizing the development of Safe modules is crucial for the ecosystem's growth, as it enhances Safe's core functionality and drives onchain compatibility. For non-module-related development efforts, there is an alternative source of funding through the SAFE grants program.\n\n**4. What are some example initiatives that would fall under this strategy**\n\n* Creating new modules, e.g. recovery module, passkeys, security guard\n\n* Make existing modules more accessible for developers and end users\n\n* Porting existing modules\n\n**5. Detail around existing data or evidence to support this thesis**\n\nThe Zodiac toolkit by Gnosis Guild is utilized by 239 entities, and has 19 active GitHub contributors, indicating its significant engagement and adoption\n\n**6. Detail around any risks associated with this strategy**\n\n* Curation and quality control: Risk of subpar module development without proper quality control\n\n* Discovery problem and fragmentation\n\n**7. If this strategy succeeds, what is the happy case?**\n\n* Diverse and robust ecosystem: A vibrant ecosystem with a wide range of functional modules\n\n* User satisfaction leading to development demand: Positive feedback from users leads to increasing demand for module development\n\n* Strong market position: Enhanced competitive advantage through modularity in the industry\n\n**8. If this strategy fails, what would be some reasons?**\n\n* Poor quality modules: Development of low-impact or redundant modules with no clear value proposition\n\n* Insufficient developer engagement: Lack of participation or interest from the developer community\n\n**9. Assessment of the strategy’s maturity and if there is additional data that needs to be collected for the validation of this strategy**\n\nThe strategy has been assessed as mature as developing modules is a key growth driver, and it's already showing initial traction in execution.\n\n**10. What budget should this strategy be allocated for?**\n\n*Disclaimer: Please be aware that the final numbers might change based on the market price of the stablecoin allocation proposal.*\n\n300.000 USDC\n____\n\n### Strategy 3: Increase awareness of Safe Ecosystem\n\n**1. Which goals does the strategy look to drive progress in?**\n\nFoster vibrant ecosystem (Goal 1): SafeDAO benefits from a vibrant ecosystem built on shared components and standards. SafeDAO supports and empowers new and existing projects integrating with the Safe Protocol or initiatives supporting the usage of Safe Protocol.\n\n**2. Which metrics and KPIs could initiatives under this strategy be measured against?**\n\n* Social media reach/engagement (for content pieces)\n\n* Cost-per-activation (Number of attributable wallet connections (\"users added\"))\n\n* Retention of attributable wallet connections\n\n* Quality of content (via individual assessment)\n\n**3. Outline the execution strategy or thesis**\n\nThe strategy could leverage content marketing and educational initiatives to highlight the benefits and functionalities of Safe products. This can cover IRL activations, educational content or documentation. This should not cover “random” educational initiatives that do not create an impact.\n\nInitiatives for this strategy should show their previous track record, avoiding untested, random efforts. Due to the difficulty in measuring effectiveness, a higher reputation standard is crucial for ensuring impactful and reliable results.\n\n**4. What are some example initiatives that would fall under this strategy**\n\n* Partnering with thought leaders for webinars and live Q&A sessions.\n\n* Creation of recurring content like newsletters or podcasts\n\n* Interactive social campaigns encouraging user participation and feedback\n\n* Workshops about how developers can leverage Safe products, e.g., SDK / Protocol with regard to modules\n\n**5. Detail around existing data or evidence to support this thesis**\n\n* Arbitrum Grants Program has expanded its awareness initiatives by engaging a broader group of contributors through various contests (like jokerace) and initiatives (such as the Gitcoin partnership). This approach has resulted in a significant increase in contributions (>20k contributions) and a surge in grant program applications, enhancing awareness. Similar strategies can be employed to activate the community's interest in SAFE's products.\n\n* Polkadot and Revolut partner to launch a “Learn&Earn” course on Revolut’s platform in order to foster the adoption of crypto, as well as to bring interest to the DOT token.\n\n* Optimism Collective's RetroPGF is dedicated to supporting projects that help develop and use the OP Stack. Eligible initiatives include YouTube channels, newsletters and educational websites. 10m OP was allocated to 195 projects, where the top 10% of projects received more than 140k OP and generated measurable results reported in the forum.\n\n**6. Detail around any risks associated with this strategy**\n\n* Misalignment of content tone or subject matter with target audience\n\n* Fragmentation and oversaturation of content\n\n* Low impact production of content through AI tools\n\n**7. If this strategy succeeds, what is the happy case?**\n\n* Significant increase in ecosystem recognition and product understanding.\n\n* Measurable uptick in wallet activations and sustained user engagement.\n\n* Further establishment of Safe as a thought leader around smart accounts.\n\n**8. If this strategy fails, what would be some reasons?**\n\n* Ineffective content that fails to create an impact\n\n* Inadequate reach due to poor distribution\n\n* Not focusing on the right target audience\n\n**9. Assessment of the strategy’s maturity and if there is additional data that needs to be collected for the validation of this strategy**\n\nQuality assurance of contributions remains a challenging task, given the broad nature of the strategy. To avoid arbitrary contributions, we aim to especially focus on setting more specific examples and emphasize stringent feedback to ensure focused and effective progress.\n\n**10. What budget should this strategy be allocated for?**\n\nDisclaimer: Please be aware that the final numbers might change based on the market price of the stablecoin allocation proposal.\n\n250.000 USDC",

      "content": "**Title**: [SEP #9] Stablecoin allocation\n\n**Authors**: Andre Geest, Christoph Simmchen\n\n**Created**: 2023-12-04\n\n**Abstract**\n\nThis proposal delineates the terms under which SafeDAO shall receive an allocation in stablecoins from the Safe Ecosystem Foundation (“Foundation”) in return for the ARB/OP tokens held for SafeDAO (by the Foundation as legal entity). This funding mechanism enables SafeDAO to fund initiatives of the Safe Ecosystem under OBRA with stablecoins.\n\n**Proposal types**\n\n[X] Other SEPs\n\n**Proposal details**\n\n**A. Terms of the proposal:**\n\n1. SafeDAO shall be allocated USDC from the Foundation in an amount equivalent to the value of the Optimism (OP) and Arbitrum (ARB) tokens currently allocated to SafeDAO (**stablecoin allocation**). This amount corresponds to approximately USD 1.6 million based on the exchange rates available on CoinMarketCap on December 10, 2023. The Foundation shall transfer the USDC to SafeDAO's designated wallet with the address [0x0B00b3227A5F3df3484f03990A87e02EbaD2F888].\n2. In return, the Optimism (OP) and Arbitrum (ARB) tokens currently allocated to Safe DAO shall be assigned to the Foundation. See the following table for the wallets and specific amounts.\n\n|Token|Wallet address|Amount|Approx. valuation in USDC|\n| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |\n|ARB|0x8fDfaF0D17E949f2bC555a1DaD72141c30D53500|257,540|296,171|\n|OP|0x3EDf6868d7c42863E44072DaEcC16eCA2804Dea1|619,584.01|1,361,034.77|\n\n3. The price of the OP/ARB tokens shall be determined based on the average relevant market price available on CoinMarketCap in the period of 30 days (closing price) before this proposal enters into effect on the date the voting period of this proposal ends on Snapshot as per the governance framework of SafeDAO (“**Effective Date**”).\n4. The transfer of the respective USDC shall be executed within 4 weeks after the acceptance of this proposal by SafeDAO.\n5. The aggregate value of the proposed exchange of OP/ARB tokens shall be capped at an aggregated value of maximum USD 1.5M on the Effective Date. If the aggregate value is higher than USD 1.5M, the amount of OP/ARB token to be transferred to the Foundation should be reduced proportionally.\n\n**B. Purpose:**\n\nTo foster the Safe Ecosystem, SafeDAO can fund initiatives in accordance with OBRA. For this purpose, SafeDAO shall now be allocated stablecoins.\n\n**C. Enter into effect / Effective Date**\n\nThis proposal enters into effect on the date the voting period of this proposal ends on Snapshot as per the governance framework of SafeDAO and upon acceptance of this proposal.\n\n***Purpose and Background***\nOBRA stipulates the funding of initiatives mainly using stablecoins. By obtaining a stablecoin allocation from the Foundation, SafeDAO can foster the Safe ecosystem according to OBRA and the constitution. This also ensures that SafeDAO has a part of its allocated treasury in stablecoins. The Foundation could use the OP/ARB token for treasury diversification or for future grants / ecosystem programs.\n\n***Effects and Impact Analysis***\n\n**Pros**:\n\n- Ensures immediate funding for SafeDAO funded initiatives.\n\n- Allows to foster and grow the Safe ecosystem.\n\n- Enables SafeDAO to have part of its allocated treasury in stablecoins.\n\n- Since OP and ARB are not swapped on DEXs but will be executed as a direct change in allocation between SafeDAO and the Foundation, there will be no market impact.\n\n**Cons**:\n\n* SafeDAO loses its opportunity to participate in Optimism and Arbitrum governance. However, this can be mitigated through the Foundation delegating the voting rights to SafeDAO or its members.\n* Missing treasury diversification: By allocating the OP and ARB token to the Foundation the treasury consists of SAFE and stablecoins. However, the OP and ARB token were meant to profit the ecosystem and not for treasury diversification.\n\n***Alternative Solutions***\n\n1. Transferring SAFE upon transferability to Foundation instead of OP/ARB token: Instead of structuring a token swap with delayed transfer in the future with an unclear reference value, using the transferable tokens in the SafeDAO treasury provides an immediate and reliable solution.\n2. Relying on Safe Grants Program Wave 2: Similar to wave 1, wave 2 will allocate 500k USD to grantees. However the grants program comes with different limitations to the funding amount and duration in contrast to wider strategies under OBRA, see the terms of [SEP #6](https://forum.safe.global/t/sep-6-safe-grants-program-sgp/3213).\n\n***Implementation***\n\nTo be implemented the proposal needs to be executed by the Foundation.\n\n[X] Request for administrative and technical support through SEF\n\n* Who is needed?

D.II. Governance framework)\n[] Other SEPs\n\n---\n\n**Proposal details**\n\nA. Scope of framework\nB. Hierarchy of governance for resource allocation\nI. Objective\nII. Strategies\nIII.

Changes to the governance framework\nAnnex 1: Vision and goals\nAnnex 2: Strategy proposal template\nAnnex 3: Initiative proposal template\n\n\n# A. Scope of framework\n\nThe Outcomes-Based Resource Allocation Model (OBRA) serves as a streamlined resource allocation framework for DAOs to allocate resources effectively. For this, OBRA introduces\n\n* **Hierarchy**: A hierarchical connection between vision, goals, strategies and initiatives (Sec. B.I)\n* **Budget**: Defines the introduction of a maximum budget per season and strategy (Sec. B.II.2 and 3)\n* **Payout**: Defines rules around how initiatives can be funded (Sec. B.III.2)\n* **Process**: Defines a clear submission and review cycle for strategies and initiatives (Sec. C)\n\nThe framework generally applies to any resource allocation from the SafeDAO treasury towards predefined counterparties, such as individuals or teams.\n\nThe framework only partially applies to resource allocations that lack a predefined counterparty, or involve a large number of beneficiaries, e.g. (retroactive) rewards and incentives. Such allocations are *initiatives* under OBRA and need to adhere to the hierarchy (Sec. B.I) and the process (Sec. C). However, the predefined budget requirements (Sec. B.II.2 and 3) and the payout terms (Section B.III.2) do not apply, which are structured for working relationships and not for rewards and incentives.\n\nNot within scope of this framework is\n\n* the joint treasury between SafeDAO and GnosisDAO\n* User allocation B from SEP #5\n* Ecosystem allocation\n* resources provided to SafeDAO by other entities, such as other DAOs or the Safe Ecosystem Foundation, e.g. airdrops/rewards or Safe Grants Program.\n\nThese allocations follow their own allocation requirements and have a maximum budget, so that there is no benefit from further streamlining them.\n\nAlso, this resource allocation framework does not encompass treasury management activities, such as exchanging assets for other types of assets, like stablecoins. Such activities are considered outside of the scope because they involve asset exchanges rather than expenditure.\n\n![5cc152499eb69aba9f4476f55f28c37759693970.png](ipfs://bafkreihciw27rybzksqxiviamh2i3hkqg2zbjvpjohf7wmndahgukrjptq)\n\n\n# B. Hierarchy of governance for resource allocation\n\n## I. Objective\n\nOBRA establishes a hierarchical relationship between vision, goals, strategies, and initiatives. By doing so, it ensures that each initiative aligns with the DAO's overarching objectives. As a result, governance can concentrate on these core areas, hereby minimizing its focus area.\n\nThe **vision** is the overarching north star – the big picture of what the DAO aspires to become. **Goals** articulate the desired outcomes that align with this vision. Both vision and goals are stipulated in the [SafeDAO constitution](https://forum.safe.global/t/sep-4-safedao-constitution/) (see also Annex 1). **Strategies** provide the high-level approach and key metrics to achieve those goals. **Initiatives** are specific actions or projects undertaken in line with a strategy to achieve the goals.\n\nAll strategies must drive forward existing DAO goals. All initiatives must be driving forward existing DAO strategies. Generally, an initiative cannot receive funding unless it is tied to a pre-existing strategy, with the wildcard strategy (see Sec. B.II.3) being the exception.\n\nBelow is a visualization how vision, goals, strategies and initiatives relate to each other:\n\n \n![6b6bc37fb05d1fffd35c6898ec38ed4123eb30d7.png](ipfs://bafkreieuw2fhdex46tvw5ncjo4wexr3jzkedkitlczmac6eemr53lfvqby)\n\n## II. Strategies\n\n### 1. General\n\nStrategies outline the different approaches designed to achieve SafeDAO’s agreed-upon goals and vision, which are both codified in the constitution. Strategies provide the pathway to reach those goals, setting the direction rather than the destination and serving as the roadmap.\n\n*Examples*:\n\n* *Focus on building more third-party Safe modules to drive safe transaction volume, which would lead to more utility and thus greater TVL*\n* *Focus on institutional crypto adoption to drive TVL*\n\nThere may be many valid strategies that the DAO can adopt to achieve its goals. SafeDAO should both carefully assess the validity of strategies while also focusing on experimenting and validating new strategies. The maturity of each strategy and progress being made on each front should determine the level of resources being allocated towards that particular strategy (see B.II.2 Budget).\n\n### 2. Budget\n\nSafeDAO operates on seasons (see [governance framework](https://snapshot.org/#/safe.eth/proposal/0x71bf4469fc289bab2d8ce99ba41d5792c1c5d581defc12042d3cf1eb3e136323)). Seasons should be allocated an overall budget, and within each season, specific strategies are assigned their respective budgets. The seasonal budget can be a range and span beyond multiple seasons. This approach is adopted because the overall SafeDAO treasury valuation for the initial seasons will be unclear. As SafeDAO matures, there may be a decision to not pre-allocate budgets anymore, opting instead for a self-assessment approach by guardians, delegates and token holders. The budget will be determined by its own SEP and can be renewed or amended in the review sprint (see Sec. C.I.).\n\n### 3. Wildcard strategy\n\nOne strategy may be a wildcard strategy. This strategy is distinct from the others in that it doesn't follow a predefined path towards the DAO's goals. Instead, it serves as a flexible and adaptable approach that can pivot based on changing circumstances, emerging opportunities, or innovative ideas. Due to its experimental and potentially riskier nature, it will be allocated a comparatively lower budget than other strategies. During review periods, it's essential to evaluate whether initiatives under this wildcard strategy can give rise to future strategies.\n\nThe strategy proposal template is in Annex 2.\n\n## III. Initiatives\n\n### 1. General\n\nInitiatives are work proposals that are funded by SafeDAO. They are more traditionally thought of as more traditional ‘DAO proposals’. All initiatives must be driving forward existing DAO strategies.\n\nThe initiative proposal template is in Annex 3.\n\n### 2. Payout procedures\n\nInitiatives are being funded under the following operating procedures:\n\n* **General**: Initiatives are funded in USDC and may have a success reward for their completion in SAFE.\n* **Payment terms**: Initiatives are generally funded by streamed payments with a 4 weeks cliff period unless the sum of funds is < 10,000 USDC in which case payment may be made through a series of scheduled payments or as otherwise agreed upon. During the cliff period the payout can be terminated by the Safe Ecosystem Foundation in extreme cases, such as the project being inactive and not communicating.\n* **Initial lump sum**: If the requested funds are < 10,000 USDC, the proposer may request an initial lump sum to kickstart the initiative. The lump sum may not exceed more than 20% of the total funding requested for the project unless the project timeline requires less than 12 weeks to complete.\n* **SAFE rewards**: The SAFE success reward will be locked up for 1 year, followed by a 1 year linear unlock via vesting contract. The success reward will be transferred at the end of the respective season where the initiative was completed.\n* **Transition period**: Due to the current non-transferability of the Safe token, including SAFE rewards to proposals and subsequent transfers are only possible in the sprint after the token becomes transferable.\n\nThe following illustration provides a visualization:\n\n![3.png](ipfs://bafkreihveigq53khzvotrlxk6imfluqgnre2zlsbkxv3524xefq54rfoku)\n\nBelow is a table that outlines how funding amount and project timelines interact.\n\n|Funding amount|Project duration|Upfront lump sum|Payment terms|Notes|\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|Small (< 10k USDC)|Short (<12 weeks)|Yes, negotiable|Upon agreement|Ideal for quick-turnaround projects needing immediate funding.|\n|Small (< 10k USDC)|Mid to long (≥12 weeks)|Yes, up to 20%|Upon agreement|Provides initial support, with rest on agreed schedule|\n|Mid to large (≥ 10k USDC)|Short (<12 weeks)|No|Streamed with 4-weeks cliff|Suitable mid- to large large projects with a short timeline|\n|Mid to large (≥ 10k USDC)|Mid to long (≥12 weeks)|No|Streamed with 4-weeks cliff|Suitable for large projects and SaaS models|\n\n# C. Submission and review cycle\n\n## I. Submission process\n\nSafeDAO operates on seasons, each lasting 16 weeks. These seasons are divided into 4 sprints of 4 weeks in accordance with the governance framework.\n\n* The first 3 sprints are the work period and have an exclusively operational focus\n* The 4th sprint is a review period in which the funded initiatives and strategies of SafeDAO will be reviewed by SafeDAO. Initiatives will continue to operate during this period.\n* New initiatives can only be proposed during the work period and not during the review period.\n* Initiatives that are funded in the 3rd sprint will be subject to review in the next season.\n* New strategies must be proposed during the review period to be considered for approval.\n* Budget approval, amendment or renewal are proposed during the review period.\n* For Season 1, there will be a transition period allowing for the submission of strategies and budgets also throughout the work period and the submission of initiatives during the review period.\n \n![4.png](ipfs://bafkreibojek7yp4bcj57eebpwkfkjh6aa2ljp3uiwd4ghganapbdpkxmxi)\n   \n\n## II. Review process\n\n### 1. Review of initiatives\n\nDuring the review period, all initiatives are required to share progress updates and are subject to review. They do not need to re-apply for funding if their pre-approved funding extends beyond the specific season. If SafeDAO terminates an initiative it has effect for the next sprint. The outstanding approved funding and SAFE rewards will be terminated and are returned to SafeDAO (all unspent funds and unvested tokens).\n\n### 2. Review of strategies\n\nSafeDAO will also review existing approved strategies and may also decide to remove approved strategies. The removal of a strategy does not automatically affect initiatives that have been funded under them. Initiatives need to be terminated separately.\n\nThe following illustration provides a visualization:\n\n![5.png](ipfs://bafkreifkdejqp7y7nyb5uq24tjfzeo4gykremanz26o7pyhmte6kgtcqiq)\n\n# D. Voting thresholds\n\nTo encourage coordinated delegation parties to emerge in the process while discouraging low effort and signal participation, there is a quorum threshold to vote on the DAO’s strategies, initiatives, review cycles and budget. ​​Below are the minimum number of Safe tokens required to meet the quorum:\n\n \n![6.png](ipfs://bafkreicvdusakfzj7nc4gwe4kt4tkx3s6iymsn6ywqse7zfq4runyj5rxe)\n    \n    \n# E. Compliance with relevant regulations\n\nAll strategies and initiatives under the resource allocation framework must adhere to the constitution, the Safe Ecosystem Foundation’s deed, its relevant regulations, including those concerning investment and funding, and, if applicable, meet KYC requirements. The Safe Ecosystem Foundation, as a steward of SafeDAO, will guide and assess ongoing compliance with these principles and take appropriate measures if these are not met.\n\n# F. Soft launch\n\nFor Season 1 and 2, the resource allocation framework will operate under a soft launch protocol. Recognizing the need for flexibility during the formative phase of SafeDAO, the Foundation retains the prerogative to deviate from the payout procedure laid out in B.III. Initiatives and C. Submission and review cycles if necessary to ensure an efficient resource allocation process. Any deviations will be communicated transparently and are subject to review in the review and governance amendment sprint. This exception is limited to Season 1 and is introduced to allow a smoother transition into the new resource allocation framework.\n\n# G. Changes to the governance framework\n\nTo implement the resource allocation, the wording of the governance framework needs to be changed in the following sections. Additions are in bold, removals strikethrough.\n\n## I. Addition of proposal types under C.II. Proposal types\n\n![7.png](ipfs://bafkreigqicjaotkxgoz6koja3ptvdqhlwlyvqcsxqz3yqu3mz5jauka54m)\n\n\n## II. Addition of D.II. Governance cycles  \n \n![8.png](ipfs://bafkreie3trp23mreklhpbnaw55enkee42vyc6prh5c5wim2o26n2py7a5a) \n\n1. Sprints 1-3\n\nThe proposals of the first 3 sprints shall address all proposal types except constitutional, and **governance proposals, resource allocation strategy, initiative terminations and budget** proposals (s. C.II. [Proposal types](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1V3M1Ev7qPBGbvlu4v5cKM4iwzf-38VuxOIKvwv0bv_k/edit#heading=h.q5izln7a0pyw)). This design shall allow a focus on fostering the Safe ecosystem while avoiding distractions from governance **-related, strategy and budget amendment** proposals.\n\n2. Sprint 4: Review and governance amendment sprint\n\nAs a counterpart to the restriction of governance proposals during the first 3 sprints, the 4th sprint is dedicated to governance **and resource allocation** review ~~and governance~~ **and strategy and budget** proposals. During this time, no other proposals shall be submitted.\n\n## III. Addition of H. Annex 1: Season 1\n\n![9.png](ipfs://bafkreifjdxjdpqgmtp2rj36duixiflgbvsfuyow77hnp5gby4qdzlsz76m)\n\n# Annex 1: Vision and goals\n\n**Vision**: Establish smart accounts as the default means for web3 interactions\n\n**Goal 1:** Foster a vibrant ecosystem\nSafeDAO benefits from a vibrant ecosystem built on shared components and standards. SafeDAO supports and empowers new and existing projects integrating with the Safe Protocol or initiatives supporting the usage of Safe Protocol.\n\n**Goal 2:** Resilience via decentralization\nThe Safe Ecosystem shall be independent from any single entity. The Safe Ecosystem components, including governance, should be decentralized and permissionless.\n\n**Goal 3:** Tokenize value\nSAFE should represent the value of the Safe Ecosystem. Mechanisms should be created to link the growth of the Safe Ecosystem to the growth in utility of SAFE.\n\n# Annex 2: Strategy proposal template\n\nChanges to the proposal templates in Annex 2 and 3 don't require the SEP process. The Safe Ecosystem Foundation holds the authority to make these modifications or delegate the responsibility to a group of guardians or other SafeDAO participants, ensuring alignment with the framework's objectives.\n\n1.

However, after 3+ years of live data emerging around decentralized networks, decentralized coordination is still a work in progress.\n\nDuring this period, we, 1kx, a major contributor towards this proposal has supported, invested, and participated in over 40+ DAOs and incubated/launched many ourselves. Through our experience, the case for decentralized resource allocation has a long way to go with finding a long-term viable model, with most DAOs experiencing major coordination failures such as the following:\n- Unclear consensus and clarity on core DAO activities and product strategy, leading to excessive spending and misallocation of community resources to misaligned initiatives.\n- Lack of oversight, feedback loops, and accountability of community initiatives leading to overhiring and working groups with unreasonably high burn rates and low output efficiency.\n- Inadequate contributor quality curation and accountability leading to a high amount of incompetent, low context individuals gaining senior leadership positions, leading to a further degradation of the community’s operating standard and contributor value extraction at the cost of the entire community.\n- Lack of data driven of decision making processes that lead to the governance capture of the community to contributors who brute force governance via bureaucratic lobbying.\n- Bloating on the DAO’s decisional surface area to a point where collective governance contributors no longer have the adequate context to govern effectively, leading to over delegation and concentration of social capital to a few select voices who are time rich but not necessarily those creating real impact for the DAO.\n\nRather than trying to address these problems incrementally, 1kx looks to propose a surface area reduced model for the governance of SafeDAO’s resource allocation known as ‘outcome-based resource allocation’ (OBRA).\n\n\n***Effects and Impact Analysis***\n\nWhat are the effects of the proposal? What are the pros and cons? What are risks?\n\nOBRA introduces processes to the resource allocation which require some administrative efforts. When strategies and initiatives are being submitted it needs to be assesses how the strategies drive goals forward and how the initiatives drive strategies forward. During the review process the existing initiatives need to give status updates and these need to be reviewed.\nOnce the first review cycle emerges, there will be an open question on how to properly incentivize the review of this work, as this becomes an operational burden on token holders and delegates. It can be expected for professional delegates to emerge as a result of such incentives.",

      "title": "[SEP #7] Governance Framework",
      "content": "**Title**: Governance Framework\n**Authors**: André Geest, Christoph Simmchen\n**Created**: 2023-07-06\n\nPlease refer to the full proposal text on the SafeDAO forum. Some parts needed to be removed to fit within the character limit on Snapshot: https://forum.safe.global/t/sep-7-governance-framework/3711\n\nAbstract: \nThe purpose of the governance framework is to define and outline the key stakeholders involved in the governance of SafeDAO, to establish a dynamic governance approach and to describe the governance process.\n\n---\n\n**Proposal details:**\n\n# A.  Hierarchy of governance sources\n \n![14c715e316420ccd26c815f7a77fb9a992ff2f59_2_700x500.png](ipfs://bafkreiceqoh6der3qr52l5nbx5hjjsagvqsawiv6rmxrqlyhrzekhduseq)\n    \nSafeDAO governance is built on a hierarchy of norms. In this hierarchy, each level must comply with the level above. On top stands the [SafeDAO constitution](https://forum.safe.global/t/sep-4-safedao-constitution/), which sets the blueprint for SafeDAO, a decentralized collective, stewarding the thriving ecosystem around the Safe Smart Accounts on Ethereum and other blockchains. The governance framework must align with the constitution, and in turn, seasons and proposals must adhere to the governance framework. This structure ensures each element supports and enforces the broader goals outlined in the constitution.\n\n# B. Stakeholder overview\n\nSafeDAO is made up of various stakeholder groups, with a participant potentially being part of several groups. An overview of each stakeholder is provided below:\n \n![cbf57e4c0bf746b84cff6cdbd1b3e48d2de74550_2_1250x1000.jpeg](ipfs://bafybeiazb5h6lcptiptrhjn3f54h5tj2ollyswmr2pe7wiilizzvhshmjq)\n    \n    \n\n## I. Token holders\n\n#### 1. Rights\n\nSafe token holders (Token holders) can vote within the scope of governance of SafeDAO (see C. Scope of governance). They can vote with their vested and unvested tokens and delegate their voting power.\n\n#### 2. Responsibilities\n\nToken holders are encouraged\n* to actively participate in decision-making processes, lending their voice to proposals, discussions, and voting.\n* to delegate their voting rights to trusted individuals or entities, if unable to actively participate\n* to fully understand the implications of their votes by doing their own research to ensure informed decisions. If they cannot commit to this due diligence, delegation to delegates is encouraged.\n\n## II. Delegates\n\n#### 1. Delegation process\n\nThe delegation process is offchain. Token holders can delegate their votes to any address of their choice. The current delegation system requires full delegation of the voting power. Partial delegation may be implemented. Token holders can redelegate or undelegate at any time. \n\n#### 2. Rights\n\nDelegates can vote on behalf of token holders who delegated their voting rights to them. Delegates may not delegate their delegated voting right to someone else. \n\n#### 3. Responsibilities\n\nDelegates should be actively involved and responsible for representing the interests of the token holders, participating in decision-making processes, and facilitating transparent and effective governance. As such, delegates should provide a short reasoning on each of their votes on Snapshot through its commentary function.\n\n## III. Guardians\n\n#### 1. Guardians selection\n\nSafe Guardians are active members of the Safe community, who have verifiably proven their commitment to SafeDAO’s vision. They steward the Safe ecosystem and protocol, while driving the adoption of Smart Accounts. They are mission-aligned and likely to be actively participating in governance. \n\nThe [first cohort of Guardians](https://safe.mirror.xyz/JTOFLIYkTF8C61-DZFBB3QzhrFSsaB8kAIx153rl9Y0) (Guardians v1) was chosen by the Foundation and has already received a retrospective token allocation and enjoys certain benefits. Given that Guardians play an essential role in SafeDAO governance by virtue of their responsibilities, there will be further cohorts. Those cohorts will be administered by SafeDAO. Details will be laid out in Guardians v2.\n\n#### 2. Rights\n\nGuardians can vote with their tokens granted as part of Guardians v1. \n\n#### 3. Responsibilities\n\nAs outlined[ here](https://forum.gnosis-safe.io/t/safe-guardian-responsibilities/2105), Safe Guardians are expected to\n\n* Keep up with announcements and discussions\n* Give feedback on Safe Ecosystem Proposals (SEPs) which will also serve as a signal to other community members.\n* Move proposals which are mature enough for a voting from Phase 1 to Phase 2.\n* Vote on SEPs via the Safe Snapshot space\n* Provide a reasoning on each of their votes on the SafeDAO forum and on Snapshot through its commentary function\n* Push new ideas that could transition to proposals\n\n* Advocate for voting delegations - boost responsibility by campaigning for other token holders to delegate\n\nGuardians are encouraged to be actively involved in discussions on the forum.\n\nDetails of the responsibilities may be specified in a code of conduct, should one be established. \n\n\n## IV. Non-token holders\n\nNon-token holders have various ways to contribute to SafeDAO. They can submit proposals, engage in discussions on the collaboration platforms and become delegates. As such their rights and responsibilities correspond to their corresponding role.\n\n## V. Safe Ecosystem Foundation (SEF)\n\nThe Safe Ecosystem Foundation (“Foundation” or “SEF”) is a foundation governed by the laws of Switzerland and established in Zug (Switzerland). A Swiss foundation is an independent special-purpose fund endowed with legal personality, whose assets may only be used to achieve the purpose of the Foundation. It is a special form of legal entity, as it has no shareholders and no beneficial owners and thereby aims to avoid the value extraction by governance bodies which are not in compliance with the purpose of the foundation.  \n\nSafeDAO is stewarded by the Foundation, consistent with the SafeDAO Constitution and the Foundation Deed. The Foundation acts as a legal wrapper of the SafeDAO treasury, facilitates and administers the governance procedures and implements passed governance proposals if necessary. \n\n\n#### 1. Purpose and mission\n\nThe Foundation Deed, the regulations, directives and policies of the Foundation in alignment with the Swiss foundation norms, delineate its purpose, mission, and governance structure. It states that the Foundation is dedicated to the development and promotion of technologies within the Safe Ecosystem, public education about the ecosystem, and the management of related assets. As a legal document, it lays down the operational blueprint, guiding the Foundation's dealings, including liaising with various entities, managing intellectual property rights, and supporting research and development. This promotes transparency and accountability in the Foundation's efforts towards achieving its objectives in the Safe Ecosystem, thereby ensuring its alignment with the overarching goals of SafeDAO.\n\nThe full text of the purpose of the Foundation in its legally binding, German version can be found [here](https://stiftungen.stiftungschweiz.ch/organisation/safe-oekosystem-stiftung). An unofficial translated version (German / English) can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_3rYBZHt5H7jIOlcKlqLOnKU0MGI27uhgzCdt2WO1tM/).\n\nIn principle, the Foundation does not have a profit-making-purpose and does not seek any profits. The Foundation may generate profits to the extent required for the realization of its purpose.\n\n#### 2. Foundation’s governance\n\n##### a. Council\n\nThe Foundation council (“Council”) is the highest governing body of the Foundation, with the core duty to implement the Foundation purpose. There is a minimum number of three Council members required in accordance with the Foundation Deed. The current Council members are elected for a term of office of 4 years. With an exit of a Council member, the remaining Council members would appoint a new member. The Council can remove a Council member with a majority vote. The current composition of the Council can be found in the [Governance Hub](https://gov.safe.global).\n\n##### b. Responsibilities of Council\n\nIn order to achieve the Foundation purpose, the Council is tasked, among other things, with:\n\n* specifying the organizational structure and strategy using Foundation regulations and guidelines,\n* personnel planning at Council and executive management level,\n* appointing and dismissing members of executive management, and people entrusted with representing the Foundation,\n* supervising members of executive management and people entrusted with representing the Foundation with respect to objectives,\n* approval of the annual report / annual financial statements,\n* supervising compliance,\n* communication with the Swiss Federal Supervisory Authority for Foundations (also known as the Eidgenössische Stiftungsaufsicht / ESA).\n\n##### c. DAO committees\n\nDAOs face a variety of unresolved legal issues. The most prominent ones are the lack of legal personality, the limitation of DAO participants' liability, and the tax treatment of community assets (please refer to the explanations of the [dydx foundation and the chosen approach of a Guernsey purpose trust](https://dydx.foundation/blog/legal-framework-non-us-trusts-in-daos)). The Foundation’s goal is to provide an innovative Swiss solution to the legal challenges by leveraging SEF’s legal personality in engagements with contracting parties and acting as a legal wrapper of the treasury for tax purposes.\n\nSEF has prepared its Foundation Deed for the possibility of setting up so-called DAO committees. The unique characteristic of these foundation native bodies is that they can be staffed with DAO participants only and the composition is chosen by SafeDAO. Furthermore, there would be the advantage that the members of the DAO committee could be supported by the legal and financial department of SEF. Administrative support would allow members of a DAO committee to focus on their substantive activities. The Council as well as SafeDAO can assign certain activities, as well as rights and responsibilities which are in their scope of governance to the DAO committees. Currently, SEF is clarifying the organizational requirements for the establishment of DAO committees with the relevant authorities. Once these requirements have been clarified, it is intended that SEF and SafeDAO will jointly coordinate the establishment of DAO committees.\n\n##### d.  Supervision of Foundation\n\nTo ensure that the Foundation duly promotes the Foundation's purpose and does not undertake any non-compliant value extraction, Swiss foundations are subject to supervision of the Swiss Federal Department of Home Affairs, enforcing through the Swiss Federal Supervisory Authority for Foundations.\n\n#### 3. Rights and responsibilities in SafeDAO\n\n##### a. Economic holder of SafeDAO assets\n\nSEF maintains stewardship over the assets of SafeDAO, e.g. Safe token allocation assigned to SafeDAO. The Foundation acts as a legal wrapper of the SafeDAO treasury. SEF does not engage on behalf of SafeDAO or allocate funds from the SafeDAO treasury without previously being signaled so by SafeDAO.\n\n##### b. Governance administration\n\nSEF assists with the administrative elements of SafeDAO's governance processes. This includes:\n\n* Moderation and facilitation of governance proposal processes.\n* Removal of proposals that are fraudulent, spam-oriented, defamatory, hateful, or otherwise inappropriate or inconsistent with the SafeDAO Constitution, SEF Foundation Deed or any Foundation regulation (if applicable).\n* Exercising oversight and control over collaboration and communication platforms such as Discourse, Discord, Telegram, Twitter, and Snapshot to ensure and facilitate effective engagement and interaction.\n* Monitoring of the voting process including the accurate reflection of voting power, voting periods, quorums and approval thresholds.\n* Other necessary services aligned with the SafeDAO Constitution to ensure orderly operations.\n\nSEF provides administrative support to governance processes in order to offer a minimum level of structure. It is open to support community initiatives that carry out governance administration independently or in addition. \n\n## VI. GnosisDAO\nSafeDAO is a spin-off from GnosisDAO (see “History” in the [Governance Hub](http://gov.safe.global)), which was decided in [GIP-29](https://forum.gnosis.io/t/gip-29-spin-off-safedao-and-launch-safe-token/3476). This states that GnosisDAO has two functions:\n* **Token holder**: GnosisDAO is a significant backer and token holder (see “Safe Token” in the [Governance Hub](http://gov.safe.global)).\n* **Joint treasury**: A joint treasury between SafeDAO and GnosisDAO was established which is collectively governed by both DAOs.\n\n# C. Scope of governance\n\n## I. Domains of governance\n\nThe following domains are under governance of SafeDAO:\n\n* **Constitution**\n* **Governance framework**: This encompasses the scope of governance, dynamic governance, decision-making process and principles of proposal implementation\n* **Resource allocation framework**, once ratified\n* **Assets of SafeDAO** (see “Treasury” in the [Governance Hub](http://gov.safe.global))\n  * SafeDAO Treasury and joint SafeDAO/GnosisDAO Treasury\n  * IP rights: ENS domain, NFTs etc.\n* **Safe Grants Program** with funding and administrative support provided by SEF\n* **SEF governance signaling**: Suggestion regarding the establishment and composition of DAO committees, once established by the Foundation\n* **Unpausing of Safe token transferability**\n* **Safe{Core} Protocol**: Parameters and other governance-related aspects, once they have been transferred to the governance of SafeDAO\n\nThe Foundation’s fiat funds and its Safe token allocation are not under scope of governance of SafeDAO, unless these have been allocated specifically and solely for the purpose of SafeDAO by the Foundation.\n\nThe below table shall help visualize the responsibilities and scope of governance of SEF and SafeDAO.\n  \n![61a7aa4faa7c0d06d8c661363623aa160194230e.png](ipfs://bafkreia4roujrhqwwc2zjzk5zmzrcskhlzjq6phyooilomfk7sr64nrgby)\n    \n## II. Proposal types\n\nSafeDAO votes through Safe Ecosystem Proposals (SEPs). These are separated into proposal types, according to the domains of governance. Proposal types can be executed either on- or offchain.\n\n|Proposal types|Description|Execution|\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|SEP: Constitutional Proposals|Changes to the constitution|offchain|\n|SEP: Governance Proposals|Changes to the governance framework and the resource allocation framework|offchain|\n|Other SEPs| All other domains of governance not explicitly stated in the other proposal types|off-/onchain|\n|Grants Council Nominations for SGP|Voting on the grants council nominations for SGP|offchain|\n\nAs steward of the SafeDAO governance the Foundation is administering which proposal type a specific proposal belongs to.\n\n# D. Dynamic governance\n\n## I. Objective\n\nThe core objective of dynamic governance cycles is to continuously evolve and optimize the democratic processes within SafeDAO. By committing to an iterative and data-driven approach, it is the aim to identify, implement, and refine the best possible governance model over time that truly reflects the collective interests of Safe’s community and promotes their active engagement.\n\n## II. Governance cycles\n\nSafeDAO will change its decision-making process over a specified time frame and run several governance experiments (seasons). Seasons will consist of the following 4 sprints.\n\n![b8d9ae3657d1df584a98e76111c5479aa11ec0d8.png](ipfs://bafkreig4t4slubn65kfd23l275smy766luqadl3dfq634zmoyajxjltowm)\n    \n1. **Sprints 1-3**\n\nThe proposals of the first 3 sprints shall address all proposal types except constitutional and governance proposals (s. C.II. Proposal types). This design shall allow a focus on fostering the Safe ecosystem while avoiding distractions from governance proposals.\n\n2. **Sprint 4: Review and governance amendment sprint**\n\nAs a counterpart to the restriction of governance proposals during the first 3 sprints, the 4th sprint is dedicated to governance review and governance proposals. During this time, no other proposals shall be submitted.\n\nNotwithstanding the aforementioned, SEPs related to the implementation and execution of the milestones of SEP #3 are allowed to be voted on in any sprint until their completion.\n\n3. **Guiding principles for timeline**\n\nThe guiding principles of the timing are (1.) to make the sprint processes predictable, (2.) to provide sufficient time for preparation and review tasks of relevant events and (3.) to strike a balance between Sprints 1-3 and Sprint 4 (review and governance amendment sprint). \n\n## III. Changes to governance\n\nChanges to the dynamic governance include the processes laid out in this governance framework which include, but are not limited to modifying the governance cycles, the proposal types and the voting mechanisms. The governance framework can be changed itself by an SEP. \n\n# E. Decision-making process\n\n## I. Governance toolkit\n\nSafeDAO governance utilizes several tools:\n\n* [Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/safe.eth): An offchain voting platform\n* [Discourse](https://forum.safe.global): A community forum dedicated to discussions around governance proposals and related topics.\n* [Discord](https://chat.safe.global/): The governance channel is used for governance announcements and less formal governance discussions.\n\nOther tools that are being used can be found in the “Toolkit” section of the [Governance Hub](http://gov.safe.global).",

      "title": "# [SEP #6] Safe Grants Program (SGP)",
      "content": "**Title:** Safe Grants Program (SGP)\n\n**Authors:** @MetaGuardian, OG post from @netrunner.eth\n\n**Created:** Wednesday 12th, April 2023\n\nPlease refer to the full proposal text on the Safe DAO forum: some parts needed to be removed to fit within the character limit on Snapshot:\n\n- What metrics measure success against each Grant category?\n\n- Role of Safe Ecosystem Foundation with the DAO and SGP\n\n- Approval Process (within Grants Application Process)\n\nhttps://forum.safe.global/t/sep-6-safe-grants-program-sgp/3213\n\n## Abstract\n\nTaking into account previous submissions by netrunner.eth. This proposal outlines a Safe Grants Program (SGP) to be run by SafeDAO, with funding and administrative support provided by the Safe Ecosystem Foundation (SEF). If voted in by the SafeDAO community, wave 1 of the program would run for 6 months with a view to iterating on the program in wave 2, based on feedback and learnings from the initial wave of Safe grants funding.\n\n## SGP Mission\n\nGrow a thriving community of contributors through funding ideas, projects and integrations. To support the decentralised growth and sustainability of the Safe ecosystem.\n\nMore specifically:\n\nDrive development and usage on top of Safe, cultivating enthusiastic users and talented builders to increase and maintain Safe's long term growth. Primarily driven by Safe{Build} and Safe{Growth} grants.\n\nBring the best and brightest community members into SafeDAO, members who believe in Safe's constitution and the constitution goals. In turn, this will attract the best contributors to the Safe ecosystem. Primarily driven by Safe{Research} and Safe{Govern} grants.\n\nNote: This grants program is not optimised to drive token utility, as token utility has not yet been ratified by SafeDAO. Instead, this SGP aims to grow our community that uses and builds on the protocol, which will in turn foster a more diverse and extensive ecosystem that a token utility model can be built upon.\n\n## Safe Grants Program - Wave 1\n\n### What work does it support?\n\n **Safe {Build} Grants**\n\nGoal: Get developers building out Safe as the default EVM wallet.\nDoing What: Build account abstraction integrations, developer experience, SDK packs, modules/guards, tooling and retail/hybrid/institutional projects. Primarily looking at early stage projects building on Safe.\nMilestones Needed: Benchmark and/or Critical (see milestones section)\n\n**Safe {Growth} Grants**\n\nGoal: Get people using Safe.\nDoing What: Usage incentive programs, user education, community growth, marketing campaigns.\nMilestones Needed: Benchmark and Critical\n\n**Safe {Research} Grants**\n\nGoal: Get people sustaining Safe.\nDoing What: Value capture programs, core protocol developments, R&D (e.g. Account Abstraction).\nMilestones Needed: Critical\n\n**Safe {Govern} Grants**\n\nGoal: Get people governing SafeDAO.\nDoing What: Increase delegate and proposer experience, governance tooling.\nMilestones Needed: Benchmark and Critical\n\n### What's the program length and expected outcomes?\n\nSGP will begin with a first wave lasting 6 months, consisting of an open period and a review period. The open period will be an initial 18 weeks of operational focus. The review period will be 6 weeks in which the SGP funded initiatives will be reviewed by the committee, token holders and delegates.\n\nThe wave 1 outcomes should be evaluated and a decision needs to be made on whether a wave 2 should commence at the 6 month deadline, after the review period. Each grantee should prove that they implemented their approved in-scope deliverables. Each grantee should prove that their project has successfully contributed to the increase of their Grant category metrics.\n\nSubsequent proposals and grants can be formulated for follow-up work, in the event a Wave 1 grant engagement goes well and a continuation is warranted.\n\n### How much funding is available for distribution?\n\nThe Safe Ecosystem Foundation has committed $1,000,000 USD in grants - see here for original announcement. As a result, SGP Wave 1 will commit a maximum of $500,000 for the next 6 months, with a further $500k available to the program for wave 2. The grants program aims to significantly ramp up in speed and scale in future waves of grants funding, dependent on the SafeDAO's feedback and learnings from Wave 1.\n\nContributors can apply to receive between $5k to $50k of funding per grant, however, the Grants committee can request exceptions from SafeDAO to exceed limits.\n\nIdeally, the maximum number of grantee projects is 30, given the administrative overhead.\n\nThe allocated SGP budget has an approximate distribution* of:\n\n- 40% of funds allocated to {Build} Grants\n- 30% of funds allocated to {Growth} Grants\n- 20% of funds allocated to {Research} Grants\n- 10% of funds allocated to {Governance} Grants\n\nPrior to the end of the initial 6 Month period of wave 1, a new SGP renewal proposal should be tabled by the Grants community for wave 2, using data and learnings collected from the SGP, to assess the program, and inform its next phase.\n\n*As SafeDAO and SGP Wave 1, is in an early period of growth, the above split reflects the priority of Safe builders and users over research and governance, in order to give the DAO more value to sustain and govern over the coming years and decades.\n\n### Grants Application Process\n\n**Application Process**\n\nThe specifics of the application process will be worked on by the Grants Lead and will be published for comments closer to the launch of wave 1 applications.\n\n**Grantee Milestones**\n\nInitial proposals should be focused on milestones over no longer than four-months.\n\nEach grant proposer will be required to include a set of milestones by which the Safe DAO Community and the Grants Committee can judge the progress of the proposer's project.\n\nMilestones enable the proposer and the Community/Committee to achieve consensus on discrete indicators of good-faith effort to achieve the aims set in a proposal.\n\nEach project may require benchmark milestones and/or critical milestones, based on its Grant category i.e. Build/Growth/Research/Govern. Inspired by Optimism grants.\n\nBenchmark milestones mark important points on the proposer's roadmap for accomplishing their aim, to demonstrate its potential success and allow the Safe community to monitor the grantees' progress. E.g. our project will get X users by Y date.\n\nCritical milestones demonstrate good faith effort to accomplish the aims set forth in a proposal, they give the Safe Community/Committee confidence that the proposer has taken actions consistent with those outlined in a successful proposal. On-chain data or other publicly verifiable information is favoured for the determination of critical milestones. e.g. \"We will deploy X smart contract on Y date.\"\n\n### Payment and Administration\n\nCurrency: 100% paid out in fiat or USDC via the Safe Ecosystem Foundation.\n\nDue to current non-transferability of SAFE tokens, retroactive SAFE rewards to successful Wave 1 Grantees can be considered as part of Wave 2 implementation. The Wave 2 proposal, which would include retroactive SAFE Grantee rewards, will be reviewed and ratified by the DAO.\n\nAny retroactive rewards would be subject to a two-year lockup period and is designed to encourage projects to participate actively in Safe governance.\n\nMilestones: Project is specified into 1-3 milestones + final deliverables.\n\nUpfront-payment: The proposer may request an initial lump sum to kickstart the initiative, but the lump sum may not exceed more than 20% of the total funding requested for the project unless the project timeline requires less than 3 months to complete.\n\n### Grants Committee\n\n**Grants Committee Structure**\n\nTo ensure that the application process will be efficient and predictable, so applicants have clear objectives and timely decisions, propose that a Grants Committee (with a Reviewer Council) is set up to run the SGP operations, starting with 6 Grant Committee members.\n\n| Role  | Expectation|\n| ------------- |:-------------:|\n| 1 Grants Lead      | Full-time 40 hrs / week     |\n| 2 Reviewers - Safe Core Team (at least one technical)     | Part-time 5 hrs / week     |\n| 3 Reviewers - Safe Community (at least one technical)    | Part-time 10 hrs / week    |\n\n\nThis committee has a term of 6 months after which the program needs to be renewed by the SafeDAO governance\n\nA stipend of 2000 USDC per month for community members (not belonging to the core team) will be given by allocating their time to reviewer responsibilities.\n\nSAFE token rewards is not feasible as this point in time due to transferability. However, retroactive SAFE rewards for successful Wave 1 Reviewers can be considered as part of the Wave 2 proposal.\n\n### Grants Council Selection\n\nA separate forum post will be created for SafeDAO community members to apply as one of the 5 reviewers (i.e. the Grants Council)\n\nDAO members must post their application to the forum thread and commitment to the delegate code of conduct (pending publication by the Safe Ecosystem Foundation (SEF)\n\nThe details of the grants council application process will be posted at least 7 days prior to the launch of applications\n\nVoting on submissions will be open for 2 weeks; reviewers with the most votes in each category will be selected for the role, and must acknowledge the selection publicly within 7 days of election, otherwise the next highest voted candidate will be contacted.\n\n### Grants Committee Responsibilities\n\n**Grants Lead - Isla Munro @1sla.eth - employed by the SEF**\n\n- Oversee the operations of the grants committee and distribution of grants. Ensure the grants program meets the strategic needs of SafeDAO and SEF.\n- Develop a process, structure and standard operating procedure for detailed grants reviews, and perform interviews, where appropriate, with grant applicants.\n- Work with proposers to ensure proposed milestones are clear, measurable, and achievable within the specified timeframe\n- Streamline the application process. And manage payments and KYC in collaboration with the Safe Ecosystem Foundation.\n- Steward projects and move applications through the grants process e.g. pushing Phase 3 grant applications to Snapshot, for voting by the Reviewers and ensuring documentation of voting rationale for each grant.\n- Monitor progress towards milestones, prepare regular reports to communicate grant decisions at the end of the grants cycle.\n- Assist teams on post grant support including connecting projects with auditors, liaising with the core contributors, providing marketing support, and other ad-hoc support\n- Create a framework and evaluate ROI of each grant including following up on milestone completion.\n\n**Reviewers (the Grants Council) - appointed by SafeDAO**\n\n- Have the subject matter expertise required to evaluate advanced proposals\n- A request for applications will provide further guidance on the specific skill-sets sought for the grants committee, and will be published in the Safe DAO Forum 6\n- Be accessible to grants applicants, provide feedback, answer questions, and respond to comments. This should be done via public communication channels whenever possible. It should be clear to grant applicants how to get in touch with the committee.\n- Provide transparency to the Grants Lead and community on availability for grants reviews for the 6 month duration of the initial program, and proactively inform of planned absences\n- Discuss proposals openly and constructively in weekly grants review calls and provide feedback to grantees based on a to be defined grants review process\n- Maintain a participation rate >75% on Grants Council votes\n- Document voting rationale for each grants vote in a clear, professional manner\n- Provide any information required by the SEF and/or the Grants Lead to publish regular reports and periodic updates in a timely manner\n- Commit to spend roughly 10 hours a week on these responsibilities, with an expected higher capacity required at the beginning and end of the grants cycle\n\n### Conflicts of Interest Policy\n\nA delegates policy and delegates commitment declaration is being developed by the SEF and grants reviewers seeking election will be expected to accept and adhere to these policies as part of their candidacy for grants council.\n\nSome basic tenets that will be included:\n\n- It is assumed that most people in the web3 community will have some kind of conflict of interest, thus transparency and communication is key\n-A declaration of key conflicts will be expected from the reviewers for any key roles / significant token-holdings with projects / protocols\n-Reviewers may not vote on grants for projects in which they have a declared conflict, e.g. direct role / personal benefit, direct competition etc.\n- Indirect conflicts to be addressed individually in respective grants council discussion and documented in the notes on voting\n\n### Grants Council Consensus\n\n1. A Snapshot sub-space will be created to allow the 5 reviewers vote on each grant proposal that reaches Phase 3 in the SGP approval process\n2. 5 reviewers will each be given an NFT badge that permits them to assign 1 vote to each proposal that is setup on the Snapshot space. The space will be open so decisions are viewable to the public.\n3. At a specific time of each month, the Grants Lead will push the validated Phase 3 proposals to the Snapshot space.\n4. At the end of each month, all reviewers must record their votes and rationale on each Phase 3 proposal.\n5. Upon the agreement of a grant allocation by the Reviewers public Snapshot space, the Safe Ecosystem Foundation will undertake the administration of the payment. Note: the SEF will first determine whether the proposal is accurate, secure, consistent with the purposes of the SEF and SafeDAO, and capable of being implemented in a legally (foundation and tax law) compliant manner.\n\n",

      "title": "[SEP #5] Redistributing Unredeemed Tokens From User Airdrop Allocation",
      "content": "* Title: Redistributing Unredeemed Tokens From User Airdrop Allocation\n* Author: [Daniel](https://twitter.com/danftz)\n* Created: 2023-01-14\n\n# Abstract\nThis proposal tries to address the unintended imbalance in the distribution of voting power that arose due to 64,4% of the tokens from the user airdrop allocation not being redeemed. \n\n# Proposal details\n## Purpose and Background\nInitially, 5% of the total supply of SAFE tokens was allocated towards an airdrop for users:\n\n![This image shows the initially planned distribution of voting power between the different stake holders](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/business20/uploads/gnosis_safe/original/1X/593b6f307a37304066ba221f2aab8962159f6baa.jpeg \"This image shows the initially planned distribution of voting power between the different stake holders\")\n\nAnd the story could have ended here, and there would have been no need for this proposal -- if not for 32,200,182 out of 50,000,000 tokens not being redeemed by users:\n\n![This image shows how many Safe tokens were redeemed by users](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/business20/uploads/gnosis_safe/original/2X/0/0a8aa30b640c34d0823b4b906489103e7570e3c4.png \"This image shows how many Safe tokens were redeemed by users\")\n\nThe purpose of this proposal is now to ensure that the originally planned distribution of voting power between the various stakeholders is achieved to the extent that it is possible.\n\n\n### Types of Allocations\n\n* **Allocation A:** Redistribute unredeemed tokens proportionately to all those who previously redeemed their allocated tokens\n\n  (Tokens would be vested over 4 years. Vesting start date is September 1st, 2022. Vested and unvested tokens can be used for voting. The tokens must be redeemed before July 1st, 2023, or they will once again return to the SafeDAO treasury.)\n\n* **Allocation B:** Explore other ideas for allocations, including but not limited to setting up a new claim period for those who were eligible for the initial claim but had not redeemed their allocations (“extend claim period”)\n\n  (Voting for Allocation B serves “only” as a signal; a final decision on extending the claim period and/or considering other ideas for allocations requires another SEP.)\n\n### Voting options\n\n* **Option 1:** Only A, using ⅓ of unredeemed tokens\n* **Option 2:** Only A, using ⅔ of unredeemed tokens\n* **Option 3:** Only A, using all unredeemed tokens\n* **Option 4:** A+B in parallel, using ½ of unredeemed tokens for A and ½ for B\n* **Option 5:** A+B in parallel, using ⅔ of unredeemed tokens for A and ⅓ for B\n* **Abstain**\n* **Make no changes**\n\n(Those are the top 5 choices of the [temperature check](https://snapshot.org/#/safegov.eth/proposal/0xfbff5ca5d50b356a45fdc56fad4d80b60a761350872a36ee8f6767fe6d616fb1))\n\n## Effects and Impact Analysis\n\nSee here for how many additional tokens each address is eligible for if any of the voting options that include Allocation A passes the official vote:\n\n* Option 1 ([Dune query](https://dune.com/embeds/1970857/3255889), [Google Sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QA8v6GIy-zPJnI4KpkG6OnNjygTvoVg0ZbmFpjbIG68/edit?usp=sharing))\n* Option 2 ([Dune query](https://dune.com/embeds/1892598/3113839), [Google Sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1RHABgq9bxVUOzaMMlUxTHPdfvKIU-TEcKIJe2Tk9T1w/edit?usp=sharing))\n* Option 3 ([Dune query](https://dune.com/embeds/1892617/3113861), [Google Sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YPOcbYpwozvRMUxRp7R9KvxvelErHUJ0wS-ic_d0P0c/edit?usp=sharing))\n* Option 4 ([Dune query](https://dune.com/embeds/1892482/3113661), [Google Sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pgpfUP5JSZrByVKowJZ46dayViKvAbRKqhE9jxmXlrw/edit?usp=sharing))\n* Option 5 ([Dune query](https://dune.com/embeds/1892598/3113839), [Google Sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1RHABgq9bxVUOzaMMlUxTHPdfvKIU-TEcKIJe2Tk9T1w/edit?usp=sharing))\n\nIf either Option 4 or 5 receives the most votes, the tokens allocated to B would be considered \"set aside\" and could be used, for example, for airdrops to L2 Safes, to reward contributors behind public goods, to give those who failed to redeem the original airdrop a second chance, or for other causes that aren’t mentioned here but expand the number of token holders. \n\nHowever, separate SEPs would have to be written for specific actions to be taken, as voting for Allocation B only has a signaling effect. In response to this signal, hopefully one or more future proposals surface.\n\n## Alternative Solutions\n\n**Not to have this proposal at all**\n\nWithout voting on this proposal there would be no clarity around the sentiment of the community when it comes to this topic.\n\n## Technical Implementation\n\nN/A\n\n# Copyright\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",

      "title": " [SEP #4] SafeDAO Constitution",
      "content": "\n* **Title:** SafeDAO Constitution\n* **Authors:** Lukas Schor (with early support from Longhash Team)\n* **Created:** *2023-01-10*\n\n\n\n# Abstract\n\nThis proposal introduces a constitution for SafeDAO, defining its stakeholders as well as its mission, goals and principles. It is proposed that changes to this constitution require a stricter governance process than regular SEPs, that is double the quorum and a ⅔ majority vote.\n\n# Proposal details\n\n## Purpose and Background\n\n> Decentralized autonomous organizations contain a particular promise: the ability to solve old coordination problems through ‘smart contracts' that encode constitutional rights. Although smart contracts are promising new tools for governance, they alone cannot govern communities; traditional constitutions and declarations of rights are still crucial for good governance. ([Metagov](https://constitutions.metagov.org/))\n\nDAOs set out to improve coordination through technical means, but soon realized that a governance smart contract is not sufficient. Without a north-star to rally the community behind, a DAO can suffer from fundamental disagreements on its general direction and lack of guidance on how to evaluate proposals.\n\nIntroducing a constitution helps resolving these issues. By agreeing to a mission, goals and principles, the DAO has more certainty on its nature and ambitions. By defining a higher threshold for changes to the constitution compared to regular proposals, the DAO avoids fundamental changes through proposals that have not received sufficient support by the community.\n\nThrough the mission, goals and principles defined in this proposal, SafeDAO will be more aligned and operate more efficiently when introducing future proposals. Specifically, I suggest the following text as SafeDAO’s initial constitution:\n\n---\n> \n> **SAFEDAO CONSTITUTION**\n\n> **I. SAFEDAO**\n> \n> SafeDAO is a decentralized collective, stewarding a thriving ecosystem around the smart contract wallet standard for Ethereum and other blockchains (“Safe Ecosystem”). SafeDAO is governed using the Safe Token (“SAFE”).\n> \n\n> **II. MISSION**\n> \n> SafeDAO’s mission is to establish smart contract wallets as the default means for interacting with web3, also known as account abstraction. Current self-custodial wallets lack the security and convenience to be a viable alternative to custodial solutions for most people. In contrast to regular wallets (EOAs), smart contract wallets provide characteristics such as recovery mechanisms, granular access control, upgradability, batching transactions as well as hybrid-custody setups. By building web3 around smart contract wallets, we reduce the reliance of users on custodial solutions, reducing counterparty risks, walled gardens and potential for censorship.\n> \n> As SafeDAO, we aspire to work towards this mission by establishing standards for composable smart contract wallets (the “Safe Protocol”). Through open source components and ecosystem initiatives we are nurturing the Safe Ecosystem, consisting of wallets, infrastructure, tooling and services. The Safe Ecosystem is building on a shared implementation of the Safe Protocol and is catering to the needs of various user-groups and use-cases in web3. SafeDAO promotes the common welfare, sustainable development, robustness and diversity of the Safe Ecosystem.\n> \n\n> **III. GOALS**\n> \n> SafeDAO shall use the following goals to work towards its mission:\n> \n> 1. Foster a vibrant ecosystem\n> \n> SafeDAO benefits from a vibrant ecosystem built on shared components and standards. SafeDAO supports and empowers new and existing projects integrating with the Safe Protocol or initiatives supporting the usage of Safe Protocol.\n> \n> 2. Resilience through decentralization\n> \n> The Safe Ecosystem shall be independent from any single entity. The Safe Ecosystem components, including governance, should be decentralized and permissionless.\n> \n> 3. Tokenize value\n> \n> SAFE should represent the value of the Safe Ecosystem. Mechanisms should be created to link the growth of the Safe Ecosystem to the growth in utility of SAFE.\n> \n\n> **IV. PRINCIPLES**\n> \n> All proposals passing the SafeDAO governance process shall adhere to the following principles:\n> \n> 1. Safe Protocol is a public good\n> \n> The Safe Protocol is core infrastructure for web3. Any changes that may be introduced do not compromise its public good nature and carefully balance the interests of different stakeholders in the Safe Ecosystem. This incentivises the unity of the Safe Ecosystem and, as a result, maintains the property of Safe as a portable account.\n> \n> 2. Token utility is aligned with ecosystem interests\n> \n> Any utility of SAFE directly or indirectly adds value to the Safe Ecosystem. Changes to token mechanisms need to consider the effects on different stakeholder including user, builder and token holder.\n> \n> 3. Use of treasury is limited to achieving SafeDAO goals\n> \n> The usage of any assets associated with the SafeDAO treasury is credibly linked to one or more of the SafeDAO goals outlined in the SafeDAO Constitution.\n> \n\n> **V. CHANGES AND AMENDMENTS**\n> \n> Changes or amendments to the constitution require a two-thirds majority and double the usual Safe Ecosystem Proposal (“SEP”) quorum at any given time.\n\n\n---\n\n## Effects and Impact Analysis\n\nThe intended main effect of this proposal is to give SafeDAO stakeholders an explicit way to coordinate around a shared mission and high-level means to get there. On a more practical level, this constitution document should have the effect of informing every stakeholder’s thinking, writing and decision-making in a way that is more likely to be in line with the general direction of SafeDAO, i.e. arguing and voting for proposals that adhere to the constitution and against if not. Assuming that the constitution in its current and future form will always be optimized for the success of the Safe Ecosystem, adhering to the constitution should have a direct impact on the success of the Safe Ecosystem.\n\nAn argument against this constitution and its higher governance threshold compared to a regular Safe Ecosystem Proposal (SEP) is the fact that SafeDAO will be more constrained in changes relating to its constitution. However, as mentioned before, this should be seen as a feature rather than a bug as it provides security and steadiness around a few fundamental elements of SafeDAO that are vital to its long-term success and should be protected by a governance threshold with higher difficulty than regular SEPs.\n\nIn terms of risks, this constitution could define a direction or high-level means that turn out to be less ideal or even counter-productive. This risk is mitigated by allowing changes to this constitution, as described in article V.\n\nAnother risk lies in this constitution being ignored, not taken seriously enough or maliciously stretching an interpretation of its contents to a point that is against the intent of the constitution. Parts of this risk can be mitigated through a dispute resolution mechanism to keep SafeDAO and its SEPs in check and provide a web3-native process to refuse SEPs that are against this constitution. Other parts can be mitigated through soft-enforcement such as requiring SEP authors to document who a proposal is related to the constitution and where there might be conflicts. Such enforcement mechanisms could be introduced through a future change in the governance mechanism of SafeDAO. \n\n## Alternative Solutions\n\n* **No constitution:** SafeDAO could choose not to introduce a constitution and proceed with regular SEPs only. In this case, the DAO would not have as much alignment on a general purpose and direction as it would have with a constitution, resulting in more information asymmetry and less coherently coordinated SEPs. Without a constitution, the DAO would also be at risk of being radically redirected through a regular proposal, whereas this constitution defines fundamental properties that can be changed, but not as easily as through a regular SEP.\n\n* **A constitution-like document under another title:** While many DAOs introduce constitutions, some adopt similar but distinct forms, such as community covenants, code of conducts, manifests or lores. Some of these options were disregarded due to their specificity, such as a code of conduct, whereas a constitution provides SafeDAO with a generalistic foundation. The title ‘constitution’ was prefered because it is universally understood globally as a foundational document.\n\n* **A constitution with a different mission, goals and principles:** While details in this constitution may well need to be changed at a later time, the overall approach to build an ecosystem around a use-case agnostic protocol remains key.\n  * **SafeDAO as a product DAO:** The SafeDAO Constitution could be focused on Safe being a vertically integrated product, consisting of smart contracts, infrastructure and user interfaces, all being provided and maintained by the SafeDAO. Doing so without fostering an ecosystem is a short-sighted effort, as existing Web3 projects have showcased that building a thriving ecosystem around a protocol can be much more impactful than just focusing on creating a product or suite of products.\n  * **Safe as DAO tooling:** One of the most visible use-cases for Safe is its use within the operations of other DAOs. Either as a Multisig solution for teams / working groups or as a DAO avatar via tools like Zodiac Reality. The SafeDAO Constitution could focus on this user-group and double-down on Safe as a DAO tool within the mission and goals. However, there are already a wide range of other user groups and use-cases currently driving value to the Safe Protocol. This includes institutional users, retail users, or progragramitc use-cases of Safe within a DevOps function, for example. The chosen framing of the SafeDAO Constitution recognises the use-case agnostic nature of the Safe Protocol and anticipates many more use-cases to emerge in the future, therefore not artificially limiting the scope of the mission.\n\n## Technical Implementation\n\nThis proposal requires a new Snapshot [Subspace](https://docs.snapshot.org/spaces/sub-spaces) to the main Snapshot space safe.eth for SEPs. The new Subspace settings reflect double the quorum and a ⅔ majority to pass a vote.\n\nFurthermore, the SafeDAO Constitution should be highlighted prominently across SafeDAO’s documentation, communications channels and onboarding processes to ensure that every current and future SafeDAO stakeholder is sufficiently aware.\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",

      "title": "​ [SEP #3] Towards clarity on milestones before voting on enabling transferability again",
      "content": "* Title: Towards clarity on milestones before voting on enabling transferability again\n* Authors: @theobtl \n* Created: 2022-12-05\n\n# Abstract\n\nThis proposal serves as a signal on milestones to be met before the question of enabling transferability of SAFE is put up for a vote again. Using single choice voting, the winning option will be considered the minimum set of milestones to be met. Due to time constraints, this proposal should be discussed conclusively by mid December.\n\n# Proposal details\n\n## Purpose and Background\n\nAfter [SEP-2](https://forum.gnosis-safe.io/t/sep-2-community-initiative-to-unpause-token-contract-enabling-transferability/1131) was [voted down](https://snapshot.org/#/safe.eth/proposal/0x1b48a83c44e323275a605b244a05bde89918fb9ec86be7bb83792eb26e544441), various arguments [have been brought up](https://forum.gnosis-safe.io/t/sep-2-community-initiative-to-unpause-token-contract-enabling-transferability/1131/236?u=theobtl) on when to vote on enabling transferability of SafeDAO’s governance token, SAFE, again.\n\nThe purpose of this SEP is to condense these arguments into distinct options in the form of milestones and give the community clarity on when a second vote on enabling transferability is supposed to take place. By providing such clarity in terms of a timeline of milestones, this proposal also serves the purpose of focusing the DAO’s attention on enabling transferability at a given time, and on other workstreams in the meantime.\n\n### List of Milestones\n\nThe initial and current summary of milestones is as follows:\n\n* Milestone A: The claim period has passed\n* Milestone B: An SEP on a constitution has been ratified\n* Milestone C: An SEP on a governance framework has been ratified\n* Milestone D: An SEP on a resource allocation framework has been ratified\n* Milestone E: An SEP on token utility has been ratified\n\nNot included above but assumed to be in place:\n\n* Activities around liquidity provision and market making have been aligned on\n* A future proposal on enabling transferability include a complete documentation of its SafeSnap specification in the proposal text\n\n### Context on the list of milestones and why they are included\n\nThis list of milestones includes several workstreams that are not yet formally being discussed on the forum in the form of proposal, but are considered upcoming milestones based on comments in the forum and elsewhere.\n\n* Milestone A “The claim period has passed” refers to the [ongoing period to claim the Safe token ($SAFE)](https://safe.mirror.xyz/p1aonqM1NSZeOFN8iY2_Ms8y6Ikuz5E76HRiEPKnCEA) which ends on December 27, 2022, 12PM CET.\n* Milestone B “An SEP on a constitution proposal has been ratified” refers to [this proposal](https://forum.gnosis-safe.io/t/discussion-safedao-constitution/1749/6) which, as of writing, is in phase 0.\n* Milestone C “An SEP on a governance framework has been ratified” refers to a proposal revising the [SafeDAO Governance Process document](https://forum.gnosis-safe.io/t/how-to-safedao-governance-process/846) suggesting a strategic, high-level approach to SafeDAO’s governance principles, processes and choice of tooling. ´\n* Milestone D “An SEP on a resource allocation framework has been ratified” refers to [this proposal](https://forum.gnosis-safe.io/t/discussion-safe-dao-resource-allocation-model-obra/1001) which, as of writing, is in phase 0.\n* Milestone E “An SEP on token utility has been ratified” refers to [remarks by several](https://forum.gnosis-safe.io/t/sep-2-community-initiative-to-unpause-token-contract-enabling-transferability/1131/236?u=theobtl) community members to align on the utility of the Safe token.\n\nA governance roadmap for SafeDAO outlining these and other governance-related milestones will be discussed independently from this proposal in detail with the appropriate level of attention which this proposal intends to free up and channel to each milestone in due course.\n\n### Summary of the Snapshot proposal\n\nThe initial and current summary of options (i.e., combinations of milestones) is as follows:\n\n1. Option 1: Milestones A and B\n2. Option 2: Milestones A, B, C and D\n3. Option 3: Milestones A, B, C, D and E\n\nThe Snapshot proposal should be set up as follows:\n\n* Voting options:\n-- 1. Option 1\n-- 2. Option 2\n-- 3. Option 3\n-- 4. Make no changes\n-- 5. Abstain\n* Type of voting system: Single choice voting\n* The default [settings](https://forum.gnosis-safe.io/t/how-to-safedao-governance-process/846) and [norms](https://forum.gnosis-safe.io/t/how-to-safedao-governance-process/846) apply\n* No use of SafeSnap\n\n### Note on the timeline of this proposal\n\nTo serve its purpose, this proposal should be ratified before any single milestone itself. Especially milestones A and B could be reached relatively soon. Milestone A (‘Claim period’) passes after Dec 27, 2022, while milestone B (‘Constitution proposal’) could be ratified as early as 14 days after it becomes an SEP, and eight days before it is uploaded to Snapshot. Consequently, this proposal should be uploaded to Snapshot by whichever of the following two dates is sooner:\n\n* Dec 18, 2022 (milestone A)\n* Eight days before the constitution proposal is uploaded to Snapshot (milestone B)\n\nAs a reminder, this proposal must also remain unchanged as an SEP for six days before it can be uploaded to Snapshot. Due to these time constraints, I encourage the community to review and suggest potential changes to this proposal within the first few days of its publication, so that the community can align on a proposal draft by no later than Dec 11, 2022.\n\nBy including the (default) options of ‘make no changes’ and ‘abstain’, every voter should in principle be able to vote in accordance with their preferences, no matter the list of voting options.\n\n## Effects and Impact Analysis\n\nWhile this proposal itself does not comprise a vote on enabling transferability nor any on-chain executable components through SafeSnap, this proposal is supposed to have a signaling function. Specifying a SafeSnap specification including an oracle that would effectively represent the various options included in this proposal is complex, if not impossible.\n\nInstead, it seems much more straightforward to follow a two-step process: The first being this proposal resulting in a signal, and in response to that signal a second, future proposal which includes a SafeSnap specification to enable transferability in a trustless manner.\n\nMerely having a signaling function makes this proposal less binding, as it would be straightforward to ignore this proposal and put the question of enabling transferability up for a vote anytime before this proposal would signal it should be. However, this proposal does not introduce any additional risk as any future proposal would still need to undergo the usual governance process and be subject to the security of a Snapshot vote.\n\n## Alternative Solutions\n\n### Use multiple-choice voting on individual milestones\n\nInstead of limiting options to a few combinations of milestones, the Snapshot vote could make use of multiple choice voting (approval voting system) to allow for greater individuality in the bundling of milestones. However, SafeDAO's [initial governance process](https://forum.gnosis-safe.io/t/how-to-safedao-governance-process/846) only allows the use of single-choice voting. Introducing other voting systems requires an SEP in itself and is not feasible within the timeframe of this proposal. A future governance framework proposal should revisit the question of allowing approval voting and/or other [voting systems supported by Snapshot](https://docs.snapshot.org/proposals/voting-types).\n\n### Have this proposal be a vote directly on enabling transferability\n\nInstead of voting on a variety of milestones to be met, this proposal could also simply pose the question once again whether transferability should be enabled and include a SafeSnap specification to do so immediately in a trustless manner. This option was discarded because the discussion around SEP-2 revealed a variety of reasons why one would vote for, against or abstain from voting. While yet another simple vote on whether to enable transferability or not would result in a simple yes/no result, this proposal at hand provides more granular and contextual information. By having more clarity on which milestones are supposed to be met before voting on enabling transferability again, any future vote on enabling transferability will be more likely to occur at an appropriate time when it is likely to get traction among the community and can be expected to pass.\n\n### Not to have this proposal at all\n\nIf we do not consider and vote on this proposal, the community will have less clarity on when the question of enabling transferability should be put up for a vote again. Future votes on enabling transferability could be instantiated any time and after each discussed milestones, without any idea on the likelihood of that proposal to pass. While the various milestones have already been discussed in the forum, on Twitter and elsewhere, there has never been a meaningful and representative analysis on the preferences of token holders. By having this proposal at hand voted on by SAFE holders and consequently have an on-chain representation of preferences on when to vote on enabling transferability again, the community won’t be left in the dark about a roadmap towards enabling transferability and can focus its attention and resources more productively in the meantime.\n\n## Technical Implementation\n\nThis proposal will not include any on-chain executable components through SafeSnap.\n\n# Open Questions\n\nDue to the single choice voting system, the poll provides a limited number of combinations of milestones. Do the options of milestones and combinations thereof reflect the most relevant ones?\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n",

      "title": "[SEP #2] Community Initiative To Unpause Token Contract (Enabling Transferability)",
      "content": "* **Title:** Community Initiative To Unpause Token Contract (Enabling Transferability)\n* **Author:** [Daniel](https://twitter.com/danftz), Co-founder @ Decentra\n* **Created:** 2022-09-28\n\n## Abstract\n\nThis is a proposal to call the unpause method of the token contract (using the SafeSnap module), which would result in the SAFE token becoming transferable. Unvested tokens would still remain in the vesting contract, and thus would not become transferable.\n\n## Proposal details\n\n### Purpose and Background\n\nIf we go with the definition of Adam Levi, Co-founder @ DAOStack, a token needs to hold two distinct properties to be actually called a token:\n\n* A token cannot be taken away from its owner.\n* The owner can transfer the token to anyone else, without requesting permission.\n\nWhile the first point is satisfied with the current design, the same is not true for the second. Since SAFE does not have the two properties mentioned above, we cannot consider it a token (yet) per the definition of Adam Levi.\n\nI'm not sure if I completely agree with him on this definition, but I do think that those two properties are fundamentally important to a token that is intended to govern a DAO. \n\nWhile non-transferability has its advantages (e.g., the governance process is more resilient against malicious vote-buying at all participation rates), it also has some disadvantages:\n\n- Without transferability enabled, those who want to participate in governance, but don't have any tokens allocated to them, can't acquire tokens (=voting power), nor can they bring in proposals on Snapshot themselves, which requires at least 20K SAFE. That basically makes this DAO a static, closed organisation as of now, without any new participants being able to come in. \n- It limits the scope of activities to be made by SafeDAO (it won't attract contributors who want to be paid in a liquid token, no feasible way to conduct OTC trades, etc.)\n\n### Effects and Impact Analysis\n\nHaving a transferable token also makes it tradeable, this is inevitable. In an adverse market environment such as the one we're currently finding ourselves in, this might lead to a suppressed valuation compared to what it could have been a year ago.\n\nHowever, I'm not sure if that's actually something we should care about, as price fluctuations are simply part of how a market-based economy works. I don't think SafeDAO should structure its roadmap around how to maximize token value. The current macro environment is outside our sphere of influence, and honestly I believe that a \"hockey-stick\" price chart is more favorable than a down-only chart with the peak being the token launch, resulting in disillusioned market participants as we've seen in the past with tokens like DYDX, PSP and countless others. \n\n**It is beyond SafeDAO's control if and how individuals/institutions choose to price SAFE. Therefore, we should not let the adverse market environment influence our decision on whether to make this token transferable or not.**\n\n### Alternative Solutions\n\n- We could keep the token non-transferable indefinitely, this would be a radical experiment in DAO governance.\n\nAs mentioned above, the advantage here is obviously the increased resilience against malicious vote-buying. The big down side is the fact, that the ownership structure, voting power held by individuals and institutions, would remain static. I reject this on this basis that I'd rather have (new) players who genuinely want to participate in governing SafeDAO accumulate tokens and thus increasing their voting power, than maintaining the status quo indefinitely. And with a high voter turnout, there would also be sufficient resilience against malicious vote buying - even with a transferable token.\n\n- We could wait until SafeDAO has matured to enable transferability of the SAFE token.\n\nThis is the alternative solution that appeals to me almost as much as the immediate unpausing of the token contract. Simply because this would give us time to think about what SafeDAO wants to accomplish and how to structure everything (there's for example the [\"Outcomes-based resource allocation (‘OBRA’)\"](https://forum.gnosis-safe.io/t/discussion-safe-dao-resource-allocation-model-obra/1001) model proposed by @pet3rpan-1kx which could be interesting to adopt). \n\nHowever, despite all of this, I believe we should not wait until SafeDAO has matured (although that would not be a disaster either). We should start attracting contributors now, for which a liquid token is necessary and we should not voluntarily limit the scope of our activities, which is a result of this non-transferability.\n\nAnd what if SafeDAO can never mature without having a transferable, liquid token to attract contributors, etc. in the first place? I can't give a definitive answer to this, but this is a realistic scenario in my opinion that should not be overlooked.\n\n### Technical Implementation\n\nTo make the token transferable no significant additional code is required, however the owner of the token has to call the unpause method of the token contract. This can be accomplished without an intermediary or gatekeeper by ensuring that the \"unpause()\" function is called by the SafeSnap module. Once the token contract is unpaused (and therefore the token is transferable), it is not possible to pause the token contract again (e.g. once transferable forever transferable). \n\n(Thanks to @Arseny for his suggestion regarding the use of the SafeSnap module)\n\nSource: https://github.com/safe-global/safe-token/blob/6a1a4a99a7f3166b525cbd5469eaf0aea1c88e54/docs/token.md\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",

      "content": "* **Title:** SafeDAO Participation Agreement \n* **Authors:** Christoph \n* **Created:** 2022-09-28\n\n---\n\n# Update 11/10/2022: [Finalised SEP1](https://cloudflare-ipfs.com/ipfs/QmPXz5NP1wyCgwBZVLc891C6EPXEvaP5NuLz5exzHJc6z8)\n\n* [Link to the finalised SEP1](https://cloudflare-ipfs.com/ipfs/QmPXz5NP1wyCgwBZVLc891C6EPXEvaP5NuLz5exzHJc6z8)\n* Incorrect referencing within the participation agreement and misspelling of defined terms have been corrected.\n* Reference to a wrapped DAO and alternatives for determining DAO participation are excluded for the time being. These are topics that require a wider community discussion and should take place at a later point in time. The outcome of this community discussion can be reflected in a modified participation agreement.\n\n*The SEP should now have reached a stage of maturity where it can be submitted for snapshot voting.*\n\n---\n\n# Abstract\n\nThis is a proposal to implement a private ordering agreement (a so-called “participation agreement”) among all DAO Participants to provide an operating framework for SafeDAO and to govern the rights and obligations of each party.\n\n# Proposal details\n\nThe [participation agreement](https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmdfAHzeELsyxdYsLesVRiJnHWYJVJCshi6RYAd1FgNJgo) [**old version; see update above**]:\n* defines SafeDAO participants.\n* provides a mutual release by DAO participants from claims arising out of or in connection with SafeDAO and a mutual waiver of claims against SafeDAO and other protected parties.\n* limits the liability of SafeDAO participants and other protected parties in relation to loss or damage arising out of the interaction with SafeDAO.\n* provides a complaints and dispute resolution procedure. \n\n## Purpose and Background\n\nMany projects use the label of a DAO in different forms and organisational structures. There is no common understanding of what a DAO is, resulting in a lack of clarity as to what rights and obligations exist when dealing with a DAO. The participation agreement aims to provide an expectation management of what a stakeholder of the Safe ecosystem can expect during their participation or interaction with SafeDAO. \n\n## Effects and Impact Analysis\n\nThe participation agreement reflects the experimental nature of decentralised governance. This state of affairs is reflected in comprehensive disclaimers, so that participation in SafeDAO is at the participant's own risk. Any person, entity or organisation interested in SafeDAO should familiarise themselves with the risks of DAO participation and, if necessary, seek additional legal advice to minimise the risks. \n\n## Alternative Solutions\n\n* DAO without participation agreement: a DAO without any legal arrangement might come at the cost of unlimited liability risks for its participants and is difficult to grasp for external stakeholders who want to interact with the DAO. \n\n* Incorporation of SafeDAO: The SafeDAO community could be incorporated into a \"traditional legal structure\". However, given the current stage of community building, this step seems too early, as the community has not yet expressed its opinion. \n\n* Partial incorporation of SafeDAO: The SafeDAO community could partially be incorporated into a dedicated legal entities or under the legal umbrella of Safe Ecosystem Foundation. However, given the current stage of community building, this step seems too early, as the community has not yet expressed its opinion. \n\n--> The participation agreement seems to be a good solution to start with, as it provides a legal framework for governance participation, does not require administrative overhead and provides the possibility for future changes.\n\n## Technical Implementation\n\nThis proposal does not require any additional code. It is made available via IPFS in order to ensure immutability.\n*Note*: The final IPFS hash will change upon incorporating community feedback. It will be final upon start of the community vote. \n\nThe participation agreement will be adopted provided that this SEP passes the SafeDAO governance process. Once passed, it should be linked on the safe.eth Snapshot space for future reference and for those interested in participating to sign before voting.\n\n\nIt is expected that changes to the participation agreement will only be made as a result of a future SEPs. \n\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n",
