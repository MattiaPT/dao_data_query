      "content": "As part of [MIP 29](https://mips.mstable.org/MIPS/mip-29), normal governance processes, including scheduled signer elections, were temporarily put on hold.\n\nIt is proposed that in order to ensure the security of the TreasuryDAO going forward, the changes outlines below are agreed upon and enacted if this proposal passes successfully.\n\n### Signer Compensation\n\nIt is suggested that signer compensation of 1000 USDC per month is reinstated, effective from the 1st of April 2023, until the multisigs are no longer required or until this proposal is superseded by another.\n\nFor the ProtocolDAO, compensation of signers would be stopped when the ProtocolDAO relinquished ownership of the Nexus contract. For the TreasuryDAO, compensation would be stopped if the amount of assets custodied by the DAO dropped below $20,000 USD in value. At this point, signers would be requested to remain in their positions without compensation in case their services were needed in the future.\n\n### Signer Structure and Replacement Process\n\nBoth the TreasuryDAO and ProtocolDAO must maintain a 4/6 signer structure at all times to ensure security as outlined in [TDP 44](https://forum.mstable.org/t/tdp-44-mstabledao-restructure/887/16).\n\nIf a signer expresses a desire to leave their position outside of a regular election process (which may not be required in the future depending on the outcome of MIP 30) , the signer group should work together to find and suggest a new trusted signer and the change should be ratified through a governance vote.\n\nIf signer compensation is stopped due to the conditions described in the previous section being met, signer structure could be reduced to a 3/5, 2/3 or 2/4 multisig by agreement within the signer group to allow for easier execution of any required transactions and to allow for any signers who may not wish to be available without compensation.\n\n### Current Signer Changes\n\nThe current signer group have been asked if they are willing to continue on as signers to avoid the need for a full election cycle at this time. One member of the TreasuryDAO has indicated that they would like to be rotated out of signer positions. As part of this TDP, it is therefore proposed that this signer, who is a core contributor, is replaced by another core contributor. The incoming core contributor would prefer to keep their identities private but other team members will be able to vouch for their trustworthiness here.\n\n**TreasuryDAO**\n\n- Nesk (0xBb330652D70eF1204d39d0880896B017a1BB1774) replaced by core contributor (0xA31DD58278Ef3777718AD6faFB8b0cebbB23b975).\n\n### **Links**\n\n- RFC: [TreasuryDAO and ProtocolDAO Signer Compensation and Replacements](https://forum.mstable.org/t/rfc-treasurydao-and-protocoldao-signer-compensation-and-replacements/1000)\n- Proposal: [TDP 55: TreasuryDAO & ProtocolDAO Signer Compensation and Replacements](https://mips.mstable.org/TDP/tdp-55.html)\n- Discussion: [TDP 55 - TreasuryDAO & ProtocolDAO Signer Compensation and Replacements](https://forum.mstable.org/t/tdp-55-treasurydao-protocoldao-signer-compensation-and-replacements/1012)\n\n**Should signer compensation be reinstated and the signer change be performed as specified in TDP 55?**",

The first Meta Vault utilizes USDC and invests it in a diversified set of 3Pool-based [Curve](https://curve.fi/) Metapools and stakes it in [Convex](https://www.convexfinance.com/).\n\nThe strategy proposed here uses Curve and Convex protocols as yield sources. USDC is the asset to enter and exit the contract. The USDC is then deposited into the [3Pool token](https://curve.fi/3pool), which itself is split up into three Basic Vaults. The Basic Vaults are wrapper contracts around Curve 3Pool Metapools and Convex that enable an ERC-4626 interface. Linked with it is a separate contract that functions by claiming and liquidating the earned rewards in the form of CRV and CVX tokens, and deposits them back into the Basic Vaults to increase the overall value for its depositors. The Meta Vault uses mUSD, BUSD and FRAX as the first set of Metapools assets that are paired with the 3Pool.\n\nThis Meta Vault is just the first step towards multiple contracts functioning as the infrastructure for yield. As it is the first application of its kind, complexity to create new sets of strategies should decrease over time. This is enabled by a modular contract structure approach with reusable components.\n\n### **Links**\n\n- RFC: [USDC Convex Meta Vault Deployment](https://forum.mstable.org/t/rfc-usdc-convex-meta-vault-deployment/946/1)\n- Proposal: [MIP 28: Deployment of USDC 3Pool Convex Meta Vault](https://mips.mstable.org/MIPS/mip-28.html)\n- Discussion: [MIP 28: Deployment of USDC 3Pool Convex Meta Vault](https://forum.mstable.org/t/mip-28-deployment-of-usdc-3pool-convex-meta-vault/957)\n\n**Should the USDC Convex Meta Vault Smart Contracts be deployed and handed over to the ProtocolDAO in order to begin mStable’s venture into ERC-4626 as proposed in MIP 28?**",

      "content": "It is proposed to codify a [Treasury Charter](https://forum.mstable.org/t/tdp-51-treasurydao-charter/947#specification-4) in order to create transparency and accountability for the TreasuryDAO when managing funds on behalf of Meta Governors. This charter describes the purpose, key activities, responsibilities, and sub-committees of the TreasuryDAO.\n\nThe TreasuryDAO is tasked with investing mStable Treasury assets. Quality investment strategies start with sound financial management. The risk which can be taken is inversely proportional to the runway available. This charter provides a framework for guiding TreasuryDAO actions in terms of runway.\n\nIt is the mission of the TreasuryDAO to secure runway to ensure that the mStableDAO operations are sufficiently funded while investing a portion of its assets into key opportunities in the ecosystem if the budget permits. As an overall guideline, Capital Preservation takes priority over Capital Generation, due to the importance and requirement to have a perpetual runway available to continuously and easily fund the operational side of mStable. It does this by maximizing the potential of the assets the treasury owns and receives to ensure the protocol can grow sustainably with risk aversion in mind.\n\nIt is proposed to have the TreasuryDAO review the Treasury Charter once per fiscal quarter to account for the fast-paced nature of the overall DeFi and crypto ecosystem, during which any amendments and changes will be communicated via our official forum and are subject to a veto process by all participants. Due to the unavoidable lag introduced by this, the Treasury will do its best to rely on passive strategies that only require compounding as a primary means of action.\n\nTo achieve this goal, the TreasuryDAO will follow specific strategies outlined in the TDP linked below. Upon successful resolution of this vote, the Treasury Charter will be uploaded to IPFS and a link provided in the official forum for reference and updated on a quarterly basis should the need arise.\n\n### **Links**\n\n- RFC: [Treasury DAO Charter](https://forum.mstable.org/t/rfc-treasury-dao-charter/914)\n- Proposal: [TDP 51: TreasuryDAO Charter](https://mips.mstable.org/TDP/tdp-51.html)\n- Discussion: [TDP 51: TreasuryDAO Charter](https://forum.mstable.org/t/tdp-51-treasurydao-charter/947/1)\n\n**Should the TreasuryDAO Charter be implemented and the TreasuryDAO guide the investments on behalf of Meta Governors as proposed in TDP 51?**",

      "content": "It is proposed that 100% of protocol revenue be directed to the treasury to provide an easier path to profitability and ensure that building long-term value is prioritized over short-term payouts to MTA stakers.\n\nWith [MIP 24](https://mips.mstable.org/MIPS/mip-24.html), the DAO decided to reroute governance fees to [purchase MTA](https://dune.xyz/queries/357907) directly off the market and distribute to stakers. This left the treasury and protocol with no organic way of capturing revenue and accruing value back to the treasury, and thus called into action an initial overhaul of the fee flow in [MCCP 20](https://mips.mstable.org/MCCP/mccp-20.html) in order to redirect 50% of these fees back towards the TreasuryDAO.\n\nIt is now suggested to increase this fee flow to 100% in order to ensure a sufficient perpetual runway for the protocol. Once this has been achieved, additional revenue can be considered to be redirected back to stakers.\n\nAs previously mentioned, it is suggested to increase the fee flow from all sources, which will also include the upcoming Convex Meta Vault and any future vaults until another proposal is made to alter this fee flow model.\n\nSince stakers are already receiving a substantial amount of inflationary MTA rewards through the [Emissions Controller](https://staking.mstable.org/#/dials), enough incentivization to stake will be left for Meta Governors to ensure continued participation in the ecosystem.\n\n### Technical Specification\n\nThe functionality to split the revenue is part of the contract `RevenueSplitBuyBack` deployed on Ethereum Mainnet:\n\n- [0x0E423505A4EB417a75b21f7A35E84ae378e665b9](https://etherscan.io/address/0x0E423505A4EB417a75b21f7A35E84ae378e665b9#writeContract)\n\nThe [ProtocolDAO multisig](https://gnosis-safe.io/app/eth:0xF6FF1F7FCEB2cE6d26687EaaB5988b445d0b94a2/home) will queue the following transaction to set the Treasury fee to 100% (effectively removing distribution of revenue to stakers):\n\n- `setTreasuryFee(_treasuryFee)`\n    - `_treasuryFee = 1000000000000000000` (1e18)\n    - `1e18 = 100%`\n\n### **Links**\n\n- RFC: [Increase Governance Fee Flow to Treasury](https://forum.mstable.org/t/rfc-increase-governance-fee-flow-to-treasury/922)\n- Proposal: [MCCP 25: Increase Governance Fee Flow to Treasury](https://mips.mstable.org/MCCP/mccp-25.html)\n- Discussion: [MCCP 25: Increase Governance Fee Flow to Treasury](https://forum.mstable.org/t/mccp-25-increase-governance-fee-flow-to-treasury/929)\n\n**Should the governance fee flow to the treasury be increased to 100%, and all protocol fees be rerouted to the TreasuryDAO as proposed in MCCP 25?**",

After the first term ends, all seats in the DAOs will be made available again for election. A signer that has served in the past term may run again. There are no maximum amounts of terms that a signer can run for.\n\n### Signer tasks and responsibilities\n\nBeing a signer for the TreasuryDAO and ProtocolDAO is an active role, and it does require regular activity and knowledge about the mStable ecosystem and the proposals that are up for execution. This new structure does not allow for passivity and simply signing transactions that are queued in the multisig!\n\n*The basic tasks and responsibilities of each signer are as follows:*\n\n1.) Be available to confirm multi-sig transactions within a 24 hour time window except in rare circumstances, which should be communicated to the Cat Herder at least 24 hours in advance\n\n2.) Be available and willing to participate actively in monthly TreasuryDAO & Governance Signer Calls (4PM UTC)\n\n3.) Have a solid understanding of good OpSec practices, including the mandatory usage of a hardware wallet.\n\n4.) TreasuryDAO signers should have a sound understanding of DeFi, keep themselves updated on developments and emerging technologies, and be able to read and understand queued multi-sig transactions and their expected behaviour.\n\n### Signer Compensation\n\nAs previously outlined, the signer position will come with responsibilities and duties. Therefore a universal contributor compensation of 1000 mUSD per month is transferred to each community signer to reward them for their time and efforts given to the DAO to their dedicated wallet.\n\n### **Links**\n\n- RFC: [Call for Applications - TreasuryDAO Signer Election (H2 2022)](https://forum.mstable.org/t/call-for-applications-treasurydao-signer-election-h2-2022/898)\n- Proposal: [TDP 45: mStableDAO Restructure - Election Process](https://mips.mstable.org/TDP/tdp-45.html)\n- Discussion: [Call for Applications - TreasuryDAO Signer Election (H2 2022)](https://forum.mstable.org/t/call-for-applications-treasurydao-signer-election-h2-2022/898)\n\n**Which of the proposed nominees should be elected as TreasuryDAO Signer in the coming term in order of preference?**",

Be available to confirm multi-sig transactions within a 24 hour time window except in rare circumstances, which should be communicated to the Cat Herder at least 24 hours in advance\n\n2.) Be available and willing to participate actively in monthly Governance Signer Calls (4PM UTC)\n\n3.) Have a solid understanding of good OpSec practices, including the mandatory usage of a hardware wallet.\n\n4.) ProtocolDAO signers should have a sound understanding of Solidity, smart contract interactions, and other relevant skills to perform their duties well.\n\n### Signer Compensation\n\nAs previously outlined, the signer position will come with responsibilities and duties. Therefore a universal contributor compensation of 1000 mUSD per month is transferred to each signer to reward them for their time and efforts given to the DAO to their dedicated wallet.\n\n### **Links**\n\n- RFC: [Call for Applications - ProtocolDAO Signer Election (H2 2022)](https://forum.mstable.org/t/call-for-applications-protocoldao-signer-election-h2-2022/899)\n- Proposal: [TDP 45: mStableDAO Restructure - Election Process](https://mips.mstable.org/TDP/tdp-45.html)\n- Discussion: [Call for Applications - ProtocolDAO Signer Election (H2 2022)](https://forum.mstable.org/t/call-for-applications-protocoldao-signer-election-h2-2022/899)\n\n**Which of the proposed nominees should be elected as ProtocolDAO Signer in the coming term in order of preference?**",

The goal of this proposal is to decrease weekly emissions and therefore reduce the selling pressure of MTA.\n\nThe Emissions Controller distributes an amount of MTA per week, according to what Stakers vote using dials. The amount of MTA to be distributed per week is a result of a polynomial function (specified in [MIP 24](https://mips.mstable.org/MIPS/mip-24.html)), which ends up distributing 30M MTA throughout 6 years.\n\nThis proposal suggests updating the emissions controller and reducing overall weekly emissions by 45%, changing the emissions curve to a linear function and extending emissions of the same amount over 6 more years.\n\n### Technical Specification\n\nThe Emissions Controller contract on Ethereum mainnet follows the proxy upgradable pattern with the following address: [0xBa69e6FC7Df49a3b75b565068Fb91ff2d9d91780](https://etherscan.io/address/0xBa69e6FC7Df49a3b75b565068Fb91ff2d9d91780#readProxyContract)\n\nThe current implementation of the Emissions Controller on Ethereum mainnet is deployed to the following address: [0xebfd9cd78510c591eda8735d0f8a87414ef27a83](https://etherscan.io/address/0xebfd9cd78510c591eda8735d0f8a87414ef27a83#code).\n\nA new implementation contract of the `EmissionsController.sol` will be deployed with the following constructor arguments:\n\nAn Instance of the `EmissionsController.sol` will be deployed with the following constructor arguments:\n\n- `nexus = 0xAFcE80b19A8cE13DEc0739a1aaB7A028d6845Eb3` (Nexus Contract)\n- `rewardToken = 0xa3BeD4E1c75D00fa6f4E5E6922DB7261B5E9AcD2` (MTA Token)\n- `TopLevelConfig = { A: 141142065475643, B: 88072648856801500, C: 0, D: 0, EPOCHS: 612 }`\n\nA and B are used for the new linear distribution schedule. C and D are no longer in use but have to be defined in order to match the storage pattern of the proxy contract.\n\nThe `EmissionsController.sol` will be updated in the following way:\n\n- `function topLineEmission(uint32 epoch) public view returns (uint256 emissionForEpoch)` change to a linear emission function as specified above.\n\nThe new implementation contract should remove the `initialize` function as the proxy has already has the storage data. The `EmissionsController` still needs to implement `Initializable` to preserve the storage slots in the proxy contract.\n\n### **Links**\n\n- RFC: [Disable all dials except staking & treasury and create a v2-incentives one](https://forum.mstable.org/t/rfc-disable-all-dials-except-staking-treasury-and-create-a-v2-incentives-one/894/12)\n- Proposal: [MCCP 24: Reduce weekly MTA emissions](https://mips.mstable.org/MCCP/mccp-24.html)\n- Discussion: [MCCP 24: Reduce weekly MTA emissions](https://forum.mstable.org/t/mccp-24-reduce-weekly-mta-emissions/912)\n\n**Should the emissions be modified to a simple linear function in order to extend the emissions schedule from 6 to 12 years as proposed in MCCP 24?**",

It also serves as a source of truth of commitments, milestones, and other key metrics that will ensure that the disbursed funds get used in the way that they are supposed to by the respective subDAO, and several proof-of-work indicators will be employed to measure that these metrics are reached.\n\nAdditionally, this will ensure that a continuous disbursement of funds happens, contrary to the previous model where the entire annual budget was disbursed immediately for use by the subDAO/requesting entity. The specific way of disbursement can be chosen by the subDAO from a selection of options offered in this framework.\n\nFinally, the framework will also include a detailed section on crafting a forum thread in case the subDAO applies for funding for the first time in order to establish a basic overview that will detail why this subDAO is applying for funding in the first place, what its position in the wider mStableDAO represents, and if the formation is of a temporary or permanent nature to gauge if continued funding beyond the first request will be required or not.\n\n### **Links**\n\n- RFC: [mStableDAO Restructure Proposal](https://forum.mstable.org/t/rfc-mstabledao-restructure-proposal/884/23)\n- Proposal: [TDP 47: mStable Restructure - Compensation Model & subDAO Funding Request Framework](https://mips.mstable.org/TDP/tdp-47.html)\n- Discussion: [TDP 47: mStable Restructure - Compensation Model & subDAO Funding Request Framework](https://forum.mstable.org/t/tdp-47-mstable-restructure-compensation-model-subdao-funding-request-framework/897)\n    \n    **Should the mStableDAO enact the Compensation Model and Funding Request Framework as proposed in TDP 47?**",

      "content": "It is proposed to source 1,000,000 mUSD from the mStable Asset Management subDAO for maintaining the 1,000,000 mUSD interest-free loan to [KBIT](http://www.kbit.com/), a market maker supporting mUSD liquidity on [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/price/mstable-usd). The loan is currently provided on a short-term basis from pre-approved project funding from the mStable Funding subDAO, as well as a loan from an investor.\n\nIn order to achieve this, $1,000,000 of the saave position [on Convex](https://zapper.fi/account/0x67905d3e4fec0c85dce68195f66dc8eb32f59179/protocols/ethereum/convex) is to be converted into DAI, which would then be deposited into Alchemix allowing 500,000 alUSD to be borrowed and swapped to mUSD. Additionally, a further 500,000 mUSD would be sourced by liquidating the remaining saave position and by utilizing a small amount of DAI from the Treasury if required.\n\n1,000,000 mUSD would then be transferred to the mStable Funding subDAO. 500,000 mUSD would be used to immediately repay the loan to the investor, and the remaining 500,000 mUSD would be used to replenish the pre-approved project funding.\n\nAs part of this proposal, it is also suggested that the TreasuryDAO be given discretionary power to recall the loan and delist mUSD if the benefits are no longer seen. This will avoid the need for another full governance proposal in the case that this is deemed appropriate, and therefore may reduce operational workload in the future.\n\n### **Links**\n\n- RFC: [Continuing to provide liquidity for Coinbase mUSD listing](https://forum.mstable.org/t/rfc-continuing-to-provide-liquidity-for-coinbase-musd-listing/860)\n- Proposal: [TDP 42: Continue Loan to Market Maker Supporting Coinbase mUSD Listing](https://mips.mstable.org/TDP/tdp-42.html)\n- Discussion: [TDP 42: Continue Loan to Market Maker Supporting Coinbase mUSD Listing](https://forum.mstable.org/t/tdp-42-continue-loan-to-market-maker-supporting-coinbase-musd-listing/874)\n\n**Should the current market maker loan be switched over to the Asset Management subDAO to maintain an interest-free loan to KBIT to support liquidity of mUSD on Coinbase as proposed in TDP 42?**",

This is done to be able to act swiftly in case of unexpected adversary behaviour.\n\nIt is suggested to replace the signer who owns the addresses `0x4B37BbC8CAb32aade27Ce8b1bb2A9E614de81E03` & `0xD8baE7d96df905E46718B6ceE3410F535e11bF20` in both groups with a different core contributor.\n\nFor the ProtocolDAO, it is suggested to onboard `0xb4dB24A77db4A77242F1e7E6Aa346aeCC440f6Df` to the group. This applies to the ProtocolDAO Safe on [Ethereum Mainnet](https://etherscan.io/address/0xF6FF1F7FCEB2cE6d26687EaaB5988b445d0b94a2) as well as on [Polygon](https://polygonscan.com/address/0x429f29a3a36b1b977c3d4ec77c695c3391e7b9ed).\n\nFor the TreasuryDAO, it is suggested to onboard `0xB27a7bD98421EB9eAEE522335F45A6F5B65C5C8d` to the main signer group and also to the Asset Management subDAO, both in which he will act in the capacity of lead signer moving forward. This applies to the TreasuryDAO Safe on [Ethereum Mainnet](https://etherscan.io/address/0x3dd46846eed8d147841ae162c8425c08bd8e1b41), as well as the Asset Management subDAO Safe on [Ethereum Mainnet](https://etherscan.io/address/0x67905d3e4fec0c85dce68195f66dc8eb32f59179) and [Polygon](https://polygonscan.com/address/0xC93B5B58739161660BAC4EE20dad74190030623E).\n\n### **Links**\n\n- RFC: Q1 [Signer Rotation & Offboarding Clause](https://forum.mstable.org/t/rfc-q1-signer-rotation-offboarding-clause/818)\n- Proposal: [TDP 35: Q1 Signer Rotation & Offboarding Clause](https://mips.mstable.org/TDP/tdp-35.html)\n- Discussion: [TDP 35: Q1 Signer Rotation & Offboarding Clause](https://forum.mstable.org/t/tdp-35-q1-signer-rotation-offboarding-clause/827)\n\n**Should the outlined signer rotation for the TreasuryDAO and the ProtocolDAO be performed and the offboarding clause be implemented as proposed in TDP 35?**",

This amount has been calculated based on the following estimated spending:\n\n- Compensating 3 community signers across the ProtocolDAO & TreasuryDAO: 12,000 MTA (1,000 USD worth of MTA per signer per month, based on current MTA price of 0.75 USD as minimum)\n- Coordinape: 7,500 MTA (Max 2,500 MTA per epoch with 3 epochs per quarter)\n- Moderator Payments: 6,000 MTA (500 USD worth of MTA per moderator per month, based on current MTA price of 0.75 USD as minimum)\n- Contests and giveaways: 1,500 MTA per quarter\n- Tipbot: 500 MTA per quarter\n\n### Community subDAO structure \n\nProposed initial structure is a 2/3 Gnosis Safe with the following signers:\n\n- Penguin (mStable Lord of the Discord)\n`0xA5DfE92D76590d169d6A622E35E223a07627A2b3`\n\n- Derrick (mStable Growth & Partnerships)\n`0x9E0F8D06E68Af898E584C4054474124B092277Dc`\n\n- Cam Soulsby (mStable Operations)\n`0x524269E900ca6ebe2FC57d719995c8D167F8b260`\n\nGiven the smaller amounts of MTA that will be disbursed by this subDAO, Gnosis Safes will be created on both Ethereum L1 and Polygon PoS.

This is a requirement from the exchanges as a pre-condition to listing on their platforms.\n\nWith this in mind, it is proposed to earmark the use of up to 2,000,000 MTA from the TreasuryDAO to serve as a loan to a trusted Market Maker should MTA get listed on a major centralised exchange.

It is proposed to source this liquidity by removing MTA from the existing MTA/BNT pair on Bancor ([410k MTA](https://zapper.fi/account/0x3dd46846eed8d147841ae162c8425c08bd8e1b41/protocols/ethereum/bancor)), as well as utilize the BadgerDAO loan from the Funding subDAO that is due now ([400k MTA](https://snapshot.org/#/mstablegovernance.eth/proposal/QmfCWb6RxmLrLyfR4ZGzKCP6ehzafrdr3BVKJDxEnh36Np)), and source any remaining MTA directly from the mStable Treasury if required, which will depend on the MTA price at the time of deployment and winning vote.\n\nThis amount will also qualify mStable to receive [additional TRIBE incentives](https://snapshot.org/#/fei.eth/proposal/0x6cb44737ef462019d65d33b4164684a6786e6c8d0222d4caa55952d067789846) from Fei Protocol, which would subsequently be deposited on [their Rari Fuse Pool](https://app.rari.capital/fuse/pool/8) to then engage in further opportunities for the Asset Management subDAO while diversifying the treasury and building rapport with Fei Protocol for further mutually beneficial endeavours down the line.\n\nThis is a ranked choice voting.

In light of recent events around the exploit of Cream Finance, it is proposed to remove this integration and move the mUSD into a dummy integration contract for the time being.\n\nSince the smart contracts for the Feeder Pool can't move from integration back to having no integration, a dummy integration contract is needed to replace it. This dummy integration would simply hold the funds and does not supply them to any platform.\n\n### Links\n- RFC: [Remove mUSD from the Iron Bank](https://forum.mstable.org/t/rfc-remove-musd-from-the-iron-bank/711)\n- Proposal: [MIP 23: Remove mUSD from Iron Bank](https://mips.mstable.org/MIPS/mip-23.html)\n- Discussion: [MIP 23: Remove mUSD from Iron Bank](https://forum.mstable.org/t/mip-23-remove-musd-from-iron-bank/717)\n\n**Should the Iron Bank integration be removed and replaced by a dummy integration contract?**",

FEI is an algorithmic stablecoin that is collateralized by PCV (Protocol Controlled Value) and is fully decentralised. The Fei Protocol primarily funds PCV via bonding curve FEI issuance. The bonding curve mints FEI in exchange for PCV at an oracle determined ETH exchange rate.\n\nThe addition of an mUSD/FEI Feeder Pool would allow users holding FEI to participate in the mStable’s ecosystem and benefit from seamless deposits directly into Save and withdrawals back into FEI. FEI has also a lending market on Aave V2 that could enhance the yield in the Feeder Pool.\n\n**Should the mUSD/FEI Feeder Pool be added to Ethereum mainnet?**",

      "content": "After [this successful internal motion](https://snapshot.org/#/mstabledao.eth/proposal/Qmexd4q2N99KbrC5WiTUHX9VAuopGC7RJjbjJFAprobsZU), and in line with [this forum post](https://forum.mstable.org/t/tdp25-olympus-pro-treasury-diversification/686), the TreasuryDAO proposes to diversify its treasury by leveraging the [Olympus Pro](https://pro.olympusdao.finance/) platform in order to sell 1,000,000 MTA worth of bonds for Curve mUSD/3pool LP tokens deposited on Convex Finance ([cvxmusd3CRV](https://etherscan.io/token/0xd34d466233c5195193df712936049729140dbbd7)).\n\nThese would subsequently be staked on Convex Finance, and accrued CRV rewards converted into cvxCRV, whereas CVX would be directly staked on Convex Finance in order to be used to vote for the mUSD gauge on Curve in perpetuity.\n\nAs an additional change to [MDP24](https://forum.mstable.org/t/mdp24-2-strategy-for-incentivized-liquidity-provision-on-convex-finance/600), all accrued CVX and CRV rewards from the existing alUSD position would also be handled in the same fashion as described above in order to maximize gauge voting potential on Curve moving forward.\n\nAll liquidity rewards will be claimed, compounded, and locked on a regular basis at the discretion of the Asset Management subDAO, which will consider and weigh operational costs against accumulated rewards in the contract to make an informed and economically sound decision on the correct timing of these operations.\n\nSince a Gnosis Safe cannot directly participate in Snapshot votes, the resulting voting power from the above deployment would thus be [delegated](https://help.gnosis-safe.io/en/articles/4820197-how-to-participate-in-a-snapshot-poll) to the Cat Herder of the Asset Management subDAO in order to participate in the gauge votes, and would take a passive stance on all other proposals on the platform.\n\nSuccessful passing of this proposal will allow the Asset Management subDAO to continue with this operation until the incentivization on Convex Finance ends, or a different proposal replaces it.\n\n**Should the TreasuryDAO allocate 1,000,000 MTA to issue bonds on Olympus Pro as outlined above?**",

This [is changing 1](https://twitter.com/VotiumProtocol/status/1447537117165506561) and is likely to get more saturated in the coming weeks, so capitalising asap is important.\n\nShould the parameter set seem to be operating poorly during this period, resulting in a net negative revenue for SAVE (i.e. mUSD TVL goes below $60m), the `savingsRate` will be updated with a relative amount, between 10% (existing) and 50% (proposed).\n\nStart date will be immediately following successful resolution of this proposal, and **last for 6 weeks**, after which time the settings will be reverted.",

Furthermore, this proposal opens up the possibility to integrate a gauges system for reward distribution that is planned for an upcoming release.\n\n**Should we upgrade to Staking V2 with the suggested parameters as outlined in the proposal?**",

      "content": "Following up on [this previous public vote](https://snapshot.org/#/mstablegovernance.eth/proposal/QmctyPCksfqCCrArxv45458CAVVp9ck49T2uriMXcTwSNe) and in line with [this forum post](https://forum.mstable.org/t/proposal-cat-herder-full-time-role/580), it is hereby proposed that the current Cat Herders for the ProtocolDAO ([dimsome](https://forum.mstable.org/u/dimsome)) and mStableDAO ([mZeroNine](https://forum.mstable.org/u/mzeronine)) complete the transition into the full-time role that was previously suggested to commence on the **1st of September 2021**. This will increase their workload to 5 days per week (8hrs/day) as Cat Herders for the respective DAO.\n\nThis change will add further responsibilities and increased compensation to the role, with a brief summary of the key facts below:\n\n**Start date** - September 1st, 2021\n\n**Compensation** - 4583 mUSD monthly, which will be paid on the 10th of every month (or the closest workday following if the 10th falls on a weekend) from the Funding subDAO.\n\nAn additional 100k MTA will be streamed linearly via Sablier from the commencement of this position over 3 years, and are vested for the entire duration.\n\n**Roles and responsibilities include, but are not limited to:**\n\n- ca.8 hrs per day, 5 times per week allocated toward making sure the mStableDAOs and ProtocolDAOs governance processes run smoothly. This includes:\n- Maintenance of open communication threads on public channels such as the forum and Discord\n- Organising and facilitating DAO signer calls and maintaining meeting minutes\n- Making sure DAO signers reach quorum and execute transactions in a timely manner\n- Managing proposal workflows to ensure they are voted on and discussed when they need to be\n- Writing & posting on the snapshot pages as a comms representative for the DAO\n- Compiling and consolidating signer feedback\n- Liaising with the ProtocolDAO and GrantsDAO\n- Maintaining and continuing to build out the respective internal Notion pages for the DAO\n- Acting as a liaison between the wider mStable community and its Community Manager (Lord of the Discord)\n- Preparing quarterly transparency reports\n- Business Development outreaches to other protocols & DAOs as necessary to drive the development of the mStable ecosystem and DAOs forward\n- Daily ecosystem research to find and investigate new opportunities & promising developments in the vertical\n- Management & maintenance of the subDAO processes & workflows within the respective DAO\n- Serving as an advisory role towards the Asset Management subDAO to locate new and promising opportunities to present to the committee on an ongoing basis\n- Flexible assistance & general support function for the wider mStable ecosystem when required\n\n**Independence from the mStable Genesis team & small print** - This role is performed for the mStableDAO and ProtocolDAO respectively on the behalf of the mStable Community and all stakeholders. \n\n*All proposals, messages, decisions, and other legally and otherwise binding actions that originate from the respective Cat Herders are done exclusively on behalf of the respective DAOs, their stakeholders, as well as mStable community as a whole, and are presented as such.*\n\n### Next Steps\n\nIf successful, both Cat Herders will commence to work in the role as described above and continue in this role until otherwise decided upon via public vote starting on the **1st of September 2021**. \n\nSince the outcome of this vote will present a financial gain for both Cat Herders, they will abstain with both their personal and public wallets on this proposal.\n\nThe option with the most votes will be executed, even if it doesn't reach a majority.\n\n**Should dimsome and mZeroNine have their contracts upgraded to the full-time role as Cat Herders and be provided with the compensation and given the additional workloads outlined above?**",

A new Gnosis Safe will be deployed for this subDAO, and all asset management requests from the ecosystem will be handled by it going forward.\n\n```\nmStableDAO Asset Management subDAO\n\nGenesis team member 1     0x4B37BbC8CAb32aade27Ce8b1bb2A9E614de81E03\nIndependent signer 1      0x9afF049B4F2E0269F5ae07F3FBf0414ef600Fb0e\nIndependent signer 2      0xba0E104fF9a400089cc4882f976094fde14AC5E3\n\nGnosis Safe               0x67905d3e4fec0C85dCe68195F66Dc8eb32F59179\n```\n\nFunding for the subDAO will be handled in the monthly mStableDAO signer calls.\n\nThe current Cat Herder will provide a short summary of activities for the Asset Management subDAO in each signer call, so the wider mStableDAO signer group can stay up-to-date on the committee. The Cat Herder will also be responsible for assuring that all on-chain activities related to these asset management activities will be executed in due time and with proper diligence to maximize the potential of said assets, and one signer from the subDAO will be chosen to liaise with the Cat Herder to handle transactions.\n\nAs an initial funding request, it is proposed to move the **entire allocation of BAL tokens** (ca 13,210) & **DAI tokens** (ca. 422k) from the mStableDAO treasury into this new Safe in order to deploy liquidity on the [Balancer Finance](https://app.balancer.fi/#/) incentivized pools, as well as the [Convex Finance](https://www.convexfinance.com/stake) platform. The exact positions are to be determined in a separate governance vote pending successful creation of the subDAO.\n\n**Should the mStableDAO Asset Management subDAO be created, and be funded with the entire allocation of BAL & DAI tokens from the mStableDAO treasury in order to engage in the protocol opportunities outlined above?**\n",

This clause applies to all further funding requests from here on out as well.\n\nThis proposal also wishes to standardize the funding process and asks that unless some drastic or unforeseen change happens to the GrantsDAO funding strategy outlined above, no further public vote is needed for its ongoing funding. This means that the mStable Funding subDAO will be empowered to grant this amount on a quarterly basis to the GrantsDAO when a top-up is necessary.\n\nShould the vote be successful, funds will be sent to the GrantsDAO Multisig address: 0x5Ed2a924cD735D725fCCa11180f7b682e614e70a\n\n**Should the GrantsDAO be funded with 100,000 MTA for Q3 of 2021, and should further quarterly funding requests be handled on an ongoing basis by the Funding subDAO, unless a drastic or unforeseen change happen as outlined above?**",

      "content": "After [this successful internal motion](https://snapshot.org/#/mstabledao.eth/proposal/QmWNYJyrnxsyFt1g2CwB18Egm49o5jPiYkmZMyUVeFDBBE) it is hereby proposed to put into existence a Funding subDAO committee within the wider mStableDAO signer group. This step is done to streamline the process and strike a solid balance between decentralization and tempo for ratifying regular expenses, along with funding of relevant entities, DAOs and core contributors to the mStable ecosystem.\n\nThe Funding subDAO committee will consist of 3 signers from the mStableDAO, and be a 2/3 multisig. A new Gnosis Safe will be deployed for this subDAO, and all funding requests from the ecosystem will be handled by this committee going forward.\n\n```jsx\nmStableDAO Funding SubDAO\n\nSigner 1 - 0x021c1a1cE318E7B4545f6280b248062592B71706\nSigner 2 - 0x8092923e19c86965733BD6F3fE6C13F549C3Bf44\nSigner 3 - 0xd576E7A3D3791C3BcF907eeDe72B2a500a8f54D5\n\nGnosis Safe - 0xfcF455d6Eb48b3289a712c0b3bC3C7Ee0b0ee4C6\n```\n\nFunding the subDAO will be handled in the monthly mStableDAO signer calls as required. \n\nThe current Cat Herder will provide a short summary of activities for the Funding subDAO in each signer call, so the wider mStableDAO signer group can stay up-to-date on the committee. The Cat Herder will also be responsible for assuring that all streams, balances, and upcoming payments will be handled in a timely and precise manner, and one signer from the subDAO will be chosen to liaise with the Cat Herder to handle transactions.\n\nIn line with the request in [this forum post](https://forum.mstable.org/t/future-funding-of-mstable/543) by the Genesis Team, the first action item will be to fund this newly created subDAO with **2.08m mUSD** from the treasury in order to fund mStable  development for the next 12 months.\n\n**Funding breakdown and destinations**\n\n**[Scarcejim](https://forum.mstable.org/u/scarcejim/summary)** as head of operations and project co-lead has calculated a projected burn rate for the next 12 months of mStable’s operations with a fully built out team that factors for:\n\n- New hires across engineering, BD, Marketing, Community Management, and DAO operations\n- Salaries in line with DeFi market expectations to retain talent\n- Funding set aside for future security audits\n- A “buffer” to manage uncertainty for the next 12 months of funding.\n\nIn total, the projected annual burn rate is approximately **2.08m USD**, with the vast majority of this going toward salaries, and includes buffers for unforeseen expenses. Broken down, this includes:\n\n- Current contributor salaries - 997,000 USD\n- Budget for future hires - 610,000 USD\n- Office space, legal, accounting, other operational expenses via operational entities - 274,600 USD\n- Security audits - 200,000 USD\n\n**Funding request broken down by area of responsibility**\n\n![https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard21/uploads/mstable/original/1X/56ab3f40b7521829730b209ea052d3565997a31d.png](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard21/uploads/mstable/original/1X/56ab3f40b7521829730b209ea052d3565997a31d.png)\n\n**Funding request broken down by current vs. future hires**\n\n![https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard21/uploads/mstable/original/1X/6c0416d12bb55dfdc81dd90ba64e4a4637e01ece.png](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard21/uploads/mstable/original/1X/6c0416d12bb55dfdc81dd90ba64e4a4637e01ece.png)\n\nShould this funding request be granted, there will be a commitment to retrospective quarterly transparency reporting so that all stakeholders in the mStable ecosystem can scrutinise how funding is spent and allocated by core contributors. \n\nShould this request be approved and the subDAO be funded, funds will distributed between three destinations:\n\n- **D44 Ventures UG,** a Berlin-based software development company founded by three mStable core contributors. It is currently contributing to mStable’s core development. The entity hires software engineers and soon will be hiring business development professionals to help scale mStable. Importantly, D44 doesn’t own these areas but rather is a core contributor to them. More granular information about D44’s function can be found [here](https://www.notion.so/3e38054d42c943b48590895dcd91e874).\n- **Barnem Ltd,** an operational and services company. It is responsible for handling mStable’s fiat operating expenses, fiat invoicing, organising core contributor work processes, and assisting with community growth and culture. More granular information about Barnem’s function can be found [here](https://www.notion.so/3b03167468e149bb90901bc1899c3005).\n- **Directly to core contributors** via Sablier stream. Core contributors have been given the option to opt-into receiving their compensation directly via Sablier stream from the DAO. Those who opt into receiving a stream will not be compensated for their work from either entity listed above.\n\n*Please note that this proposal supersede the USD funding request for the Swiss-based mStable Association, approved [here](https://snapshot.org/#/mstable/proposal/QmTH4vnUapkeQncep8yK5iLnGuufGF9Km8bgKibBEsS1mm). This is because the non-action letter from FINMA has not yet been approved, meaning it is not able to fund contributors through grants from the Association as of yet. Given this, and the need to continue to fund mStable’s development, we are proposing that the Association’s funding would need to be subject to another Meta vote following the possible FINMA non-action letter should Meta Governors and the community feel it is necessary. The above structure is designed to be effective without the mStable Association.*\n\n**Should the mStableDAO Funding subDAO be created, and be funded with 2.08m mUSD from the treasury in order to continue to fund the development of mStable over the next 12 months?**",

This change will add further responsibilities and an increased compensation to the role, with a brief summary of the key facts given below:\n\n**Start date** - July 1st, 2021\n\n**Compensation** - 2500 mUSD & an additional 2k USD monthly paid in MTA, calculated from the 30 days VWAP of the previous month. This will be paid on the 10th of every month (or the closest workday following if the 10th falls on a weekend or holiday) from the mStable Fund Manager wallet which in turn receives the funds from the mStableDAO treasury\n\nBoth cat herders voluntarily commit to locking all MTA rewards received in the mStable staking contract for at least 12 months from the commencement of this new and upgraded contract, including the migration from the legacy v1 contract to the new v2 contract in September. This means that all MTA rewards can be redeemed at the earliest on the **1st of July 2022**.\n\n**Roles and responsibilities**\n\n- c.8hrs per day, 3 times per week allocated toward making sure the mStableDAOs and ProtocolDAOs governance processes run smoothly. This includes:\n- Maintenance of open communication threads on public channels such as the forum and Discord\n- Organising and conducting DAO signer calls and maintaining curated records of these meetings\n- Making sure DAO signers reach quorum to execute transactions in a timely manner\n- Managing proposal workflows to ensure they are voted on and discussed when they need to be\n- Writing & posting on the snapshot pages as a comms representative for the DAO\n- Compile and consolidate internal signer feedback in regards to the respective DAO\n- Calibrate between the different DAOs of the mStable ecosystem to ensure smooth day-to-day operations\n- Maintain and continue building out the respective internal Notion page for the respective DAO\n- Acting as a liaison between the wider mStable community and it's Community Manager (Lord of the Discord) and the respective DAOs\n\n**Independence from the mStable Genesis team & small print** - This role is performed for the mStableDAO and ProtocolDAO respectively on the behalf of the mStable Community and all stakeholders. \n\nAll proposals, messages, decisions, and other legally and otherwise binding actions that originate from the respective Cat Herders are done exclusively on behalf of the respective DAOs and mStable community as a whole and do in no way reflect the opinions or wishes of the persons acting in this role.\n\n**Next Steps** - If successful, both Cat Herders will commence work in the upgraded role as described above and continue in this role until the proposal for a full-time position resolves, which will not happen later than the **1st of September 2021**. This intermediate step is present to ensure that the increased workloads are ramping up slowly and gradually, and that both Cat Herders have adequate time to adjust and accommodate themselves with the new responsibilities prior to the full-time commitment.\n\nSince this proposal marks a financial gain for both Cat Herders, they will abstain with both their personal and public wallets on this proposal.\n\nThe option with the most votes will be executed, even if it doesn't reach an absolute majority.\n\n**Should dimsome and mZeroNine have their contracts upgraded to the above mentioned half-time role as Cat Herders and provide them with the compensation and additional workloads outlined?**",

The proceeds of this earned asset will go towards interest bearing mUSD (imUSD) and interest bearing mBTC (imBTC) asset holders.\n\n**Should we migrate DAI and WBTC to Aave v2?**",

      "content": "As set out in [MCCP-4](https://mips.mstable.org/MCCP/mccp-4), it has been previously proposed that MTA's token emission be optimised. However, whilst MCCP-4 detailed changes to mAssets (mUSD and mBTC) it did not address the rewards going to incentivising the [MTA/WETH Uniswap Pool](https://www.notion.so/mstable/%5B%3Chttps://info.uniswap.org/pair/0x0d0d65e7a7db277d3e0f5e1676325e75f3340455%3E%5D(%3Chttps://info.uniswap.org/pair/0x0d0d65e7a7db277d3e0f5e1676325e75f3340455%3E)), or Staking V1 rewards.\n\nThe mStableDAO has sought to open a discussion around the potential reduction of rewards for the MTA/WETH Uniswap pool in order to reduce the total amount of MTA being emitted, and to focus incentives upon mStable's new Feeder pool architecture. This was presented in this [forum post](https://forum.mstable.org/t/mdp20-2-mta-weth-earn-reward-changes/423/6).\n\nIt is now proposed to reduce these rewards in line with suggestions from community members in the forum thread. As it was unanimous to reduce these rewards gradually, a 4 week \"transition period\" has been set as the default transition window for all options. \n\nThis has been done to reduce voting complexity to one variable (the final amount of MTA). Should a strong argument be presented by the community to change the length of this \"transition period\", a new proposal will be put forth to decide upon it.\n\n**Should weekly MTA rewards to the MTA/WETH Uniswap pool be reduced?**",

For example, a user provides liquidity (starting at time t0), waits for 1 month and then claims rewards (time t1) - 67% of MTA earned will be immediately withdrawn and the other 33% will be vested linearly, starting from t0 + 2 months and finishing at t1 + 2 months.\n\nThis mechanism is already active in the imUSD Vault and is described again [here]([https://forum.mstable.org/t/closed-mip-5-tokenise-musd-save-enhance-capital-efficiency-and-add-deposit-box/275/6](https://forum.mstable.org/t/closed-mip-5-tokenise-musd-save-enhance-capital-efficiency-and-add-deposit-box/275/6)).\n\nWhat should the lockup parameters be?",

When trying to swap 'out' sUSD, and you will get an error \"Error during estimation execution reverted: There is not enough liquidity available to redeem\".\n\nThis is due to Aave not having enough available sUSD to withdraw from its lending market: https://app.aave.com/markets.\n\nThe mUSD cache keeps a certain proportion of each bAsset in raw form (e.g. sUSD, not on Aave), to make mint/swap/redeem cheaper with that asset. When the cache goes to 0, it tries to reset itself to x% of total supply (in this case $1.6m USD) in raw sUSD by redeeming asUSD (read more [here](https://mips.mstable.org/MIPS/mip-3)). There is not enough available liquidity to do this at the moment on Aave.\n\n**This is nothing to be concerned about**. AAVE are planning to disable borrowing, so this will mean that loans gradually get repaid and liquidity frees up.\n\nIn the short term we propose a significant reduction to the size of our cache size so that most withdrawals are unblocked.\n\nSetting the cache to 2% would free it up and allow it to operate under relatively normal circumstances, keeping between 0-740k USD in the cache at any one time.\n\nShould we set the cache to 2% to free up the basket?",

There has also been a clear consensus amongst the community to emit fewer MTA. The lockup period would accomplish this temporarily, along with the measures proposed in other polls. \n\nWhat percentage of MTA for Savers should be unlocked immediately, and how long do you think the lock up period should be?\n\n1. Assign the 20/80 split and 6 month lockup outlined by the genesis team in this proposal.\n2. Assign unlock/lock percentages and periods, but in some other way different to the core team's suggestion.

Providing an `imUSD` deposit box, a place where long term savers can store their `imUSD` and earn `MTA`\n    - This is aimed at supporting the migration of funds, and ensuring that recipients of system yield have a say in how it is distributed\n    - To ensure long term alignment, earnings will be boosted for `MTA` stakers, and lockups will apply\n\nArguments in favour of making it composable include enhancing its functionality, improving capital efficiency for depositors and increasing SAVE’s potential to be integrated across the DeFi and CeFi ecosystems.\n\nAll other functionality of the existing platform would remain the same – savers would be required to deposit mUSD into SAVE to mint the composable token and mUSD and the composable SAVE would remain separate tokens/assets.\n\nNote the implementation of this change would require the existing SAVE contract to be closed and, over time, existing savers would migrate their deposits to the new, composable SAVE contract.\n\nMIP-5 can be accessed here - [https://mips.mstable.org/MIPS/mip-5](https://mips.mstable.org/MIPS/mip-5)\n\n**Should mStable's SAVE functionality be amended as outlined in MIP-5?**",

The specifics are outlined below:\n\n- Begin to wind down and re-allocate MTA from the USDC/mUSD pool, in equal portions over a 4 week period.\n- Allocate a portion of these MTA towards the Deposit Box over a 4 week period, increasing the weekly amount by 3000 MTA per week to a final weekly allocation of 12,000 MTA\n- Excess MTA will be removed from EARN emissions or used elsewhere subject to governance approval (such as an educational campaign on RabbitHole).\n\n**How do you think MTA should be allocated to the new `imUSD` Deposit Box?**\n\n1. Allocate MTA in the manner outlined by the team in this proposal.\n2. Allocate MTA to the imUSD Deposit Box, but in some other way different to the team's suggestion.

MTA Governors voted in favour of re-allocating these rewards to existing EARN pools, and winding down the 5 MTA/ 95 mUSD EARN pool gradually over a period of 4 weeks. \n\nIn discussions in Discord, Telegram and mStable's forum, feedback on what this re-allocation should be was sought. Three options were proposed:\n\n1. Re-allocate all 15K MTA to the existing 50 ETH/50 MTA Uniswap pool\n2. Re-allocate all 15K MTA to the existing ETH/mUSD Uniswap pool\n3. Distribute the 15K MTA equally amongst existing EARN pools\n\nArguments in favour of re-allocating the MTA to the existing 50 ETH/50 MTA EARN pool noted that this pool's liquidity is not competitive with others, potentially resulting in higher slippage.\n\nArguments in favour of re-allocating the MTA to the 50 ETH/50 mUSD Uniswap pool noted that Uniswap has 9x more total value locked and 16x more trading volume than Balancer, along with being a way to promote mAssets.\n\nFinally, there were no arguments in favour of equally redistributing the MTA to existing EARN pools, only a statement made with some support from the community.\n\nOf the options proposed, the option with the highest vote weight will be selected and implemented, even if it is below a majority (50%) in favour.\n\nIf you are in favour of reallocating the 5 MTA/95 mUSD EARN pool's rewards over a 4 week period, where should the 15,000 MTA weekly rewards be sent?\n\n",

This MIP proposes to implement a cache to reduce frequency of interactions with the lending pools, thus reducing gas costs in MINT, SWAP and REDEEM by 70-90% for the majority of users.\n\n**Proposal**\n\nmStable proposes upgrading the `Masset.sol` contract, allowing it to track and retain a percentage of all collateral in it’s “cache”. Only if necessary will the `Masset` then deposit or withdraw from the lending markets. When a deposit or withdrawal happens, the cache will reset to the ideal target weight, determined by a governance parameter. Subsequently, the `BasketManager.sol` will be upgraded to use the cache data during normal interest collection.\n\n**Subsequent votes**\n\nA subsequent vote closer to release will decide which percentage of total supply will be held in the cache at any one time.\n\nShould this cache be added at this time?",

This MIP will make 2 fundamental changes to the way system income is collected and distributed. The first of which is how the SWAP fees are tracked over time, and the second of which is the frequency of lending market interest is collected. The lending market interest will be collected intermittently and streamed second by second to SAVE.\n\nShould the lending market interest be batched to reduce gas costs?",

      "content": "A poll on this topic was recently held but ambiguity in the previous iteration lead to some confusion and several community members asked for those items to be clarified and brought to another vote. In short, in the previous vote for MTA rewards in Curve's mUSD Metapool, more than 50% of votes favoured some rewards while almost 50% favoured 0 rewards. \n\n**Context** - Curve Finance has added an mUSD/3pool Meta Pool to their platform that sees equal parts mUSD and 3pool [USDT, USDC, and DAI] deposited with CRV rewards for liquidity providers, which launched 14 October 2020 after a positive Curve DAO vote. This pool is incentivised with CRV through the LiquidityGauge (currently offering ~20% APY).\n\nThis pool will act as a major source of trading volume for mUSD given that it benefits from [StableSwap](https://www.curve.fi/stableswap-paper.pdf) [PDF] design and the existing liquidity in the 3pool.\n\nWhile the popular vote of the previous poll (50.4%) was in favour of assigning rewards, this was diluted due to having multiple 'yes' options while the main concerns from 'no' voters being further dilution of MTA, with some confusion over where the MTA would be allocated from. An ideal voting process would have first been a yes/no, followed by a proposal on where (if anywhere) this allocation should come from, and in what quantity.\n\nAfter discussions in mStable's Discord server, Telegram group and forum, it is proposed to add 10,000 MTA to Curve's mUSD/3pool Metapool. \n\nA second, separate poll is available for those who agree with this proposal to determine from where the 10,000 MTA is derived.\n\n**Should 10K MTA be allocated to Curve's mUSD/3pool Metapool?**",
