      "content": "\nYAP-3: Yung Artist Program and Yung Ape Gallery\n\nFor many of us, it was the art that made us fell in love with the Yapes. We have a fantastic designer team who worked tirelessly for months to get them all in perfect shape. As a project and movement, we value art and we want to be as close to the art scene as possible. We want to attract more talent and we want to be the collection that supports art in a very public way. There are a lot of yung, talented artists out there who needs backing and this will be a movement. \n\nFor this, the proposal is to have an Yung Artist Program and construct a Yung Ape Gallery. \n\nHere are the details of the activation:\n\n1. We will make an announcement on social media that Yung Apes will be hosting an art competition. We will ask them to drop their art or their favourite artist in the comments. \n2. The team will go over the submissions and finalize a shortlist of 5 candidates.\n3. DAO will choose the winner from those 5 candidates through voting. \n4. First place: We will buy 2ETH worth of the artists and the art pieces will be stored in the Yung Ape Gallery account.\n5. Second place: Will be commissioned to do an art piece for the Yung Ape Gallery. Tentative cost would be 0.5ETH for this.\n6. Third place: Will be gifted a Yung Ape. \n\nThe objectives of formulating Yung Artists Program and curating the Yung Ape Gallery would be:\n\n- First and foremost, having a positive impact in the ecosystem and support the artists.\n- Yung Ape Squad having a voice and presence in the art community.\n- Supporting and funding up and coming artists will create a network effect where we will be to attract more eyes.\n- This will be the first step to position ourselves as an online community that does not just concentrate on our own collection but the whole ecosystem.\n- Building a Yung Ape Gallery with artists that have high potential can be a great move. We will be essentially transforming ourselves to becoming Art Collectors.\n- In the future, Yung Ape Gallery can be created in a metaverse envoirement to attract more eyes.\n\nIn our opinion the Yung Artist Program and the Yung Ape Gallery will be a strategy that we refer to multiple times and will continue to give fruits to our project.",

      "content": "As many of you know, one of our community members Smiv was scammed last week. Even though we take all the possible measures we can to keep everyone safe, unfortunately, he fell victim, lost his Yung Apes and additional funds.\n\nSmiv has played a big role in the community ever since the first day he joined. He has been super active and supportive to other members. As a result, when this news broke, there was an overwhelming request from the community to support him.\n\nAs the project team, our immediate response was of course positive. We reached out to him and discussed the details. Providing them here:\n\n- He had 3 Yung Apes taken away, around worth of 0.5ETH.\n- He also had some funds taken away from him, totalling his loss to 1ETH.\n\nWe are in favor of covering his full loss and funding him 1ETH from the DAO. However the final decision will be up to you with your votes. \n\nWe are also doing this to get this situation as much as visibility as possible. Please note that this is a 1 time action we can take. As you can understand, we cannot keep funding scammed members. Please stay safe out there and do not trust anything. ",
