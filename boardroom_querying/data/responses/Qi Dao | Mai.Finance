      "content": "---\nnetwork: All Chains  \nauthor: 0xNacho  \nimplementor: Guardians\nimplementation-date: Post-approval  \ncreated: 2024-09-21  \n---\n\n### Summary\n\nThis proposal aims to adjust the borrowing rates on QiDao’s V2 vaults in response to recent macroeconomic changes during Q3. The DAO is assessing whether to vote on one of the following approaches:\n\n- Minor adjustment: Lowering interest rates by 50 basis points (bps).\n- Moderate adjustment: Lowering interest rates by 150 bps.\n- Significant adjustment: Lowering interest rates by 300 bps.\n- Major adjustment: Following market rates with a cap at 5%, effectively lowering interest rates by half.\n- Maintain Current Rates: Keeping rates unchanged, with the option to reassess later based on further developments.\n- Abstain.\n\n### Abstract\n\nIn light of recent macroeconomic shifts that have led to lower borrowing costs across the market, this proposal suggests adjusting QiDao's interest rates to reflect these trends. The options include a range of adjustments, from minor to major, allowing the DAO to choose the best path forward.  \nOnly V2 vaults with configurable interest rate parameters will be affected, while other vaults (e.g., V1 vaults) will remain unaffected.\n\n### Motivation\n\nThe shift in borrowing costs across the market, influenced by macroeconomic factors, presents an opportunity for QiDao to adjust its borrowing rates to remain competitive. Aligning interest rates with broader market trends could help maintain and attract borrowers, while ensuring the protocol continues to generate sustainable revenue.  \nHowever, it’s important to recognize that lower interest rates could lead to more MAI circulating in the market, which could increase the cost of maintaining liquidity on decentralized exchanges (DEXs). This increased cost needs to be balanced against the additional revenue generated from borrowing activity, to ensure that QiDao remains financially sustainable while offering competitive rates.\n\n**Considerations:**\n\n- **Competitiveness:** A rate reduction would help QiDao stay competitive in the context of decreasing borrowing costs across DeFi.\n- **Sustainability:** It's important to balance rate adjustments with the need to maintain protocol revenue.\n- **Liquidity Costs:** More MAI in circulation will increase the cost of maintaining liquidity on DEXs, which needs to be offset by the additional borrowing revenue.\n- **Market Positioning:** Lowering rates too aggressively could lead to revenue losses, while doing nothing may risk losing borrowers to platforms offering lower rates.\n\n### Specification\n\nIf rates are adjusted, the interest rate on V2 vaults will be reduced by either 50 bps, 150 bps, 300 bps, or follow market rates capped at 5%, based on the DAO consensus.\nNo changes will be made to vaults without adjustable interest rates.\n\n### Rationale\n\nAligning QiDao’s interest rates with broader macroeconomic shifts will help the protocol remain competitive in the DeFi lending space. However, adjustments must also take into account the sustainability of the protocol and the potential impact on revenue streams. Additionally, any increase in MAI circulation resulting from lower rates must be carefully managed to avoid excessive liquidity costs on DEXs.\n\n### Technical Specification\n\nFor V2 vaults, adjust the interest rate parameter based on one of the selected options (50 bps, 150 bps, 300 bps, or following market rates capped at 5%).  \nVaults without configurable interest rates will remain unchanged.\n\n### Configurable Values\n\n- Lower the interest rate by 50 bps, resulting in a 9.50% borrowing rate.\n- Lower the interest rate by 150 bps, resulting in an 8.50% borrowing rate.\n- Lower the interest rate by 300 bps, resulting in a 7.00% borrowing rate.\n- Follow market rates, with a cap at 5%, effectively lowering rates by half.\n- Maintain current rates, keeping the borrowing rate at 10%.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThis proposal presents five options for adjusting or not interest rates in response to macroeconomic changes after Q3. The DAO will vote on whether to lower rates by 50, 150, 300 bps, follow market rates capped at 5%, or maintain current rates while monitoring the situation.",

      "content": "---\nnetwork: Ethereum\nauthor: Benjamin.lens\nimplementor: Snapshot Members\nimplementation-date: Immediately after approval\ncreated: 2024-04-19\n---\n\n### Summary\n\nThis proposal aims to implement the next stage of QiDao governance, by opening the proposal posting procedure to aveQI lockers that meet a minimum threshold.\n\nHistorically, proposal drafts were first discussed on the Discord forum, where active community members would provide feedback and approve which proposals were voted on. This step was crucial in allowing community members without a significant amount of voting power the ability to have a say in proposals. It also helped established the culture of the community and its values. However, the final say has always been had by QI holders.\n\nAs QiDao has established its culture and processes over the years, it is time for the next step: opening the snapshot page for direct proposal posting. This evolution will allow any aveQI holder with enough voting power to post proposals.\n\nA full description of the governance vision for QiDao can be read here: https://mirror.xyz/qidaoprotocol.eth/o3CEXcXBshGltLSVMzGRq1itdR_hjN5lpyLWzaYbdG0\n\n### Abstract\n\nThe changes proposed are to set quorum, voting period, voting delay, and voting power thresholds for posting proposals.\n\nThe threshold to post proposals will be 150,000 aveQI, roughly 2.5% of the total vote. This limit protects the DAO page from spam proposals and ensures the alignment of proposers to the DAO.\n\nThere is a voting delay of 24 hours for proposals to be assessed by voters, and a set period of 72 hours for voting. Quorum for proposals is 600,000 aveQI, approximately 10% of the total voting power.\n\n### Motivation\n\nThe goal of this proposal is to continually and responsively decentralize QiDao's governance process.\n\n### Specification\n\n### Rationale\n\nThis change decentralizes yet another step in QiDao's governance process.\n\n1. Posting drafts - decentralized by Governance Page\n2. Posting proposals - decentralized by this proposal\n3. Voting on proposals - decentralized by original governance powers delegation to QI lockers\n4. Executing proposals - partly decentralized by QiDao Guardians\n\n### Technical Specification\n\nSee configurable values changed below.\n\n### Configurable Values\n\n* Voting delay: 1 day\n* Voting period: 3 days\n* Minimum threshold for posting proposals: 150,000 aveQI\n* Minimum quorum for proposals: 600,000 aveQI",

      "title": "QIP236: Deprecate V1 Vaults on Polygon PoS",
      "content": "---\nnetwork: Polygon PoS\nauthor: Tate\nimplementor: QiDao Guardians\nimplementation-date: Immediately after approval\ncreated: 2024-04-17\n---\n\n### **Summary**\n\nThis proposal is to deprecate v1 vaults on Polygon. By deprecating the v1 vaults QiDao will be able to repeg MAI to $1.00  on Polygon and profitably maintain the peg moving forward.\n\n### **Abstract**\n\nThis QIP establishes two options for offboarding Polygon V1 vaults. \n\nOption 1: If this option is chosen, Polygon V1 vaults will be deprecated by adjusting the collateral factor on each vault by 20 percentage points each week until it reaches 0%. This collateral factor adjustment schedule will be announced and initiated as soon as the proposal passes. The liquidation penalty on all v1 vaults will be reduced to only 1% to lessen the potential impact on any v1 vault users.\n\nOption 2: If this option is chosen, the collateral factor on all Polygon V1 vaults will be set to 0% exactly 2 weeks after the proposal passes. Liquidation penalties will be set to 1% for all vaults to lessen the potential impact on any v1 vault users.\n\n### **Motivation**\n\nAs of writing this, MAI on Polygon is trading at $0.83 USD. 17% below peg. 221 QIP was successful in removing the bad debt from Polygon. However, there is not enough revenue being generated on Polygon to drive enough demand for MAI to repeg to $1. Now that the bad debt is gone, the path to repeg MAI can be straightforward. As the largest chain for QiDao by TVL and the 3rd largest by circulating MAI, Polygon needs to maintain a healthy peg for QiDAO to experience healthy growth. The peg issue on Polygon is negatively impacting both current investors' and potential investors' sentiment and trust in MAI/QiDAO and therefore negatively impacting the DAO's ability to grow, even on other chains.\n\nThe DAO cannot profitably maintain the peg for MAI on Polygon because there is $4.3M circulating MAI and most of the TVL/collateral that was used to mint that MAI is not generating any revenue for the protocol. Because there is not sufficient revenue generation relative to the amount of MAI circulating, creating enough demand for MAI to maintain the peg is very challenging. Deprecating the v1 vaults is necessary so that the protocol can repeg MAI and then maintain that peg, profitably.\n\nAdditionally, the PSM strategy has proven to be very successful and profitable on Base and Linea. By establishing the peg on Polygon, it would allow QiDao to deploy a PSM for Polygon.\n\n### **Rationale**\n\nDeprecating the v1 vaults has been actively discussed within the community and Discord for a long time now. Ultimately two ideas emerged through those discussions. A \"Zapper\" to help migrate deposits from v1 to v2 vaults and schedule to decrease the CF of the v1 vaults until it is 0% on all v1 vaults. For this proposal, building a zapper was excluded as part of the solution for three reasons: 1) It would require dev resources and take significant time to build. 2) It could create smart contract risk 3) It is generally believed that those 0% interest loans have been benefitting from no interest for a long time and now the QiDao should at least get the .5% repayment fee, rather than provide them with a fee-free way to exit the position. Current v1 vault users will be able to exit their v1 positions and open new v2 vault positions if they desire.\nTo minimize the negative for any v1 vault users that ultimately get liquidated, the liquidation penalty should be set to 1%. It should not be set to 0% because there needs to be an incentive to liquidate the vaults even when MAI is trading at $1.00. Because liquidity for MAI on Polygon is relatively thin, peg would be achieved relatively quickly.\n\n### **Technical Specification**\n\nThe collateral factor (CF) will be adjust according to the option chosen by voters. Typically this is stated in terms of 'minimumCollateralPercentage' for MAI. Converting CF to minimumCollateralPercentage and vice-versus can be done as shown below:\nCF = 1/minimumCollateralPercentage\nminimumCollateralPercentage = 1/CF\n\n### **Configurable Values**\n\nminimumCollateralPercentage\ngainRatio",

      "content": "---\nnetwork: Base\nauthor: Benjamin.lens\nimplementor: QiDao Guardians\nimplementation-date: Post-approval\ncreated: 2024-04-18\n---\n\n### Summary\n\nThis proposal aims to make AERO vaults at QiDao a competitive and attractive option for AERO holders to source liquidity.\n\n### Abstract\n\nThe change proposed is to lower the interest rate on AERO vaults from 25% to 10%. No changes are requested for the collateralization ratio.\n\n### Motivation\n\nAs Chainlink has created an AERO feed, many lending markets will start integrating AERO as collateral. QiDao has to capitalize on its first mover advantage by establishing itself as *the* place to borrow with AERO. The only lending market that is currently planning to launch AERO as collateral is Sonne, with 30% LTV (333% min CDR). \n\n### Specification\n\n### Rationale\n\nLowering the interest rate to 10% will attract more borrowers to QiDao vaults. Community feedback so far has been that the current 25% IR is much to high.\n\n### Technical Specification\n\nSee parameter change below.\n\n### Configurable Values\n\nCall setInterestRate function with \"1000\" value.",

The protocol TVL is currently over $3Bn. ezETH is backed by ETH, wstETH, and wBETH.\n\n### Security\n\nThe main security considerations are AVS slashing risk and bridge risk.

A total of 5k ezETH can be minted daily by Connext using the xERC standard.\n\n### Vault specifications:\n\n* Collateral asset to be used: ezETH\n* Minimum collateral to debt ratio: 130%\n* Fees: 10% interest rate\n* Minimum debt: 100 MAI\n* Maximum debt: 1M MAI\n* Oracle provider: API3 or Redstone\n* Risk grading: B\n* Risk methodology: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1X85z8yMCHcwloKVC6TqO_fWtL2pSlof6ysfaLvyIBTg/edit?usp=sharing\n\n### Motivation\n\nezETH is an extremely large addressable market for QiDao. There are not many alterantives for ezETH-backed loans on certain L2s, such as Base and Optimsim. This presents a notable opportunity for QiDao to grow its TVL.

Developers can easily deploy their existing contracts on zkEVM, and users can move their assets from Ethereum and conduct transactions off-chain. These transactions are bundled into groups with a zero-knowledge proof to verify their validity.\n\n### Abstract\nOKX have been in long dicussions with QiDao and are hoping to provide our 50m user base and $OKB holders access to overcollateralised loans powered by $MAI. QiDao will play a crucial role towards our mission of onboarding millions of new users to ethereum via our zkEVM Layer 2 ‘X layer’. The X Layer team also have a good understanding of QiDao and will also work hand in hand with the QiDao team to onboard quality assets as collateral to meet the demands of the current DeFi landscape such as interest bearing collateral and we are extremely excited for what is to come.\n\n### Vault specifications:\n\n* Collateral asset to be used: OKB (gas token for X Layer)\n* Minimum collateral to debt ratio: 140%\n* Fees: 10% interest rate\n* Minimum debt: 100 MAI\n* Maximum debt: 1M MAI\n* Redemption premium: 2%\n* Oracle provider: API3\n* Risk grading: A-\n* Risk methodology: [risk assessment](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Wz6E-DXdfhC5bBTO7iD3Z1K2kTgpacYTFVHVDYE2CVI/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n### Motivation\nGet first mover advantage and access to a huge amount of $OKB, LRTs and bluechip tokens onboarded on X Layer from OKX's CEX to become the premier stablecoin of X Layer.\n\n### Why Build on X Layer?\n**Boundless scalability:** enable ZK-powered DApps on X Layer, with 100% EVM compatibility and easy-to-use developer tools for deployment.\n\n**Powered by OKX:** seamless OKX product integrations, all-in-one Web3 gateway, and access to 50M+ users in the OKX ecosystem.\n\n**Security:** rely on robust secure mechanisms from Ethereum, with trustless interoperability.\n\n**Low fee:** same coding experience as Ethereum, with 100x less in costs.\n\n**Portal to Web3:** enter the world of Web3 via OKX Wallet, built with compact infrastructure modules to create innovative DApps.",

Since only V2 vaults have interest rate paratmeters, the proposal only affects those vaults. This will replace all other fees for those vaults. For vault contracts with no interest rate parameter, no changes are proposed.\n\n### Motivation\n\nThe changes to the cost of borrowing are directly connected to an increased cost of borrowing across DeFi. Below is a list of all major comparable projects and their costs of borrowing. As can be observed, QiDao fees are too low.\n\nAave 1-month average borrow rate for USDC\n\n* Ethereum: 11.61%\n* Base: 9.84%\n* Optimism: 13.34%\n* Polygon: 12.39%\n\nGHO borrow rate without holding Aave: 10.52%\n\nSparkDAO: 14%\n\nAbracadabra\n* Ethereum: 15%\n* Arbitrum: 7-10% (plus a one-time mint fee of 1%)\n* Blast: 6% (plus a one-time mint fee of 0.5%)\n\nInverse\n* Above 16% borrow rate (estimate due to the need to buy DBR to pay interest)\n\n### Specification\n\n### Rationale\n\nImplementation only requires changes to fee parameters. \n\n### Technical Specification\n\nSee section below.\n\n### Configurable Values\n\nSet interest rate parameter to 10%, where possible.

It is a non-rebasing LST.\nmpETH on Defillama https://defillama.com/protocol/meta-pool-eth\n\n### Security\n\nHere are both security audits done by @BlockSecteam and @halbornesecurity\n\n* [mpETH Contract Blocksec Audit](https://docs.metapool.app/master/security/audits/blocksec-audit#audit-staking-eth-with-meta-pool-on-ethereum)\n* [mpETH Contract Halborn Audit](https://github.com/HalbornSecurity/PublicReports/blob/master/Solidity%20Smart%20Contract%20Audits/MetaPool_ETH_Staking_Smart_Contract_Security_Audit_Report_Halborn_Final.pdf)\n\n### Vault specifications:\n\n* Collateral asset to be used: mpETH\n* Minimum collateral to debt ratio: 135%\n* Fees: Interest rate (Fed funds rate)\n* Minimum debt: 100 MAI\n* Maximum debt: 100,000 MAI\n* Oracle provider: on-chain price via API3 https://docs.metapool.app/master/meta-pool-by-chains/ethereum-network/mpeth#true-price\n* Risk grading: C+\n* Risk methodology: [link to rubric template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18sRPJRLx9wwQv70v0_UDbDaSxlUx0xr1n_eoPHrg6fM/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n### Motivation\n* Grow QiDAO presence in emergent markets with a focus in Latin America and South East Asia, specifically in Brazil, Indonesia, Mexico, Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam.\n* QiDAO community can participate and have access to Meta Pool DAO grants\n* mpETH will be bridged on LINEA Protocol, so users can use it as collateral in a MAI vault\n* Incentives of $3,000 to $4,000 USD in mpETH for the mpETH<>MAI pool on Lynex \n\nmpETH wants to empower users from emergent markets to be able to engage with Decentralized Finance, we acknowledge that QiDAO has a large user base in these regions and the Meta Pool DAO wants to support its growth. Working to onboard millions of users.\n\nmpETH is a non-rebasing liquid staking token (LST), which means the scenario of depegged price is reduced and does not need a wrapping to accrue staking rewards, plus the calculation of the accruing rewards is done every second. Coingecko page: https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/mpeth\n\nCurrently mpETH has a boosted APY of more than 5%, which is supported by the SSV Network protocol rewards; which will be accruing for the next 12 months. Rewards are on ETH, accruing all the value in mpETH and avoiding dual token rewards. \n\nMeta Pool is partnering with Linea and their ecosystem, we intend to build a go to market strategy to expand usage of Linea. There is full alignment from investors such as Dragonfly and IOSG. The first 3 months Meta Pool DAO will be providing liquidity on the Lynex DEX and working with QiDAO to support MAI liquidity pools, providing incentives for their growth and promotion on the current user base of more than 13,000 community members.\n\nMeta Pool DAO is commiting ETH staking rewards fees to be distributed to blockchain projects in emerging markets; they are allocating the first 2000 ETH to this initiative. \n\nFor now they are running programs with Gitcoin, participating in Gitcoin Round 18 (GR18) for LATAM projects and GR19 to the Global Chinese Community.\n\nCurrently running a campaign with Giveth to support projects in the APAC region and looking to engage the QiDAO community to have access to this Quadratic Funding round.\n\nIn their current Meta Pool DAO grant Round N.6 they are currently allocating more than $20,000 USD to support projects in emerging markets, which will also be open for the QiDAO community to participate in.

      "content": "---\nnetwork: Ethereum Mainnet\nauthor: UMA Protocol\nimplementor: Alex Gaines (@abg4) & QiDao Guardians\nimplementation-date: Upon approval\ncreated: 2024-02-28\n---\n\n### Summary\n\nThe UMA token provides economic guarantees to protocols using UMA’s Optimistic Oracle (OO). UMA’s community of token holders provide the human component, as voters, for the OO's final resolution on disputes or queries. \n\nUMA tokens are also used to vote on protocol upgrades and UMA DAO funds allocations. The strength of the token will track with the strength and adoption of the UMA ecosystem as a whole. Active and accurate voters earn a healthy yield for their participation.\n\n### Security\n\nUMA tokenholders receive inflationary rewards (~30% APR) to stake and participate in governance. Therefore, a large amount of UMA tokens (~25M) are staked and participating in governance decisions via the below voting contract:\n- https://etherscan.io/address/0x004395edb43EFca9885CEdad51EC9fAf93Bd34ac\n\nThe incentive to stake UMA leads to less liquidity on decentralized exchanges and could impact the token's volatility. The vault specifications have been adjusted accordingly.\n\n### Vault specifications:\n\n* Collateral asset to be used: UMA\n* Minimum collateral to debt ratio: 140%\n* Fees: 8% (Variable)\n* Minimum debt: 10,000 MAI\n* Maximum debt: 200,000 MAI\n* Oracle provider: Chainlink via Oval\n* Risk grading: C+\n* Risk methodology: [link to rubric template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1sD6X5E0g0GiE5CnpMUvlN7VOiYICXzUQPq9Ta9hZRXk/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n### Motivation\n\nAdding UMA will enable a pilot program for QiDao to use Oval. Oval enables QiDao to capture MEV created as a result of liquidations. Oval wraps Chainlink price feeds and enables OEV auctions by leveraging Flashbot’s MEV-Share infrastructure. [Here](https://docs.oval.xyz/) are the docs to learn more about Oval.\n\nThe objective is to use UMA as a pilot program and after 2 months create another proposal that expands Oval to other Ethereum Mainnet assets. This will enable a new source of revenue for QiDao.\n\n### Quorum Standards\n\nThe option with the most votes will be adopted\n\n### Options\n\n* Approve proposal\n* Further discussions needed\n* Abstain",

The protocol attempted to fix this depeg by increasing demand to hold the stablecoins. This has not worked. By removing repayment fees, the goal is to contract MAI's supply on Base. \n\n### **Rationale**\n\nSince short positions were entered when MAI was at peg, loan holders can make a return by repaying when MAI is below peg. Repayment fees are a barrier to this activity as they penalize loan holders that repay.\n\n### **Specification**\n### **Technical Specification**\n\nThis proposal recommends the parameter changes outlined in the following section.\n\n### **Configurable Values**\n\nSet closingFee to 0 on cbETH and wstETH vaults",

As of now the vaults do not function at all due to Chainlink cutting all price feeds, which has resulted in the users funds being locked inside. A simple switching of the oracle would solve this problem and allow users to get access to their funds.\n\n### Motivation\n\nThis repair is simple and can be carried out without great time or cost.\n\n### Specification\n\n### Rationale\n\n The chainlink oracle is no longer used by harmony, they have now partnered with Band for all price feeds, due to this change the MAI vualts are unable to be repaid and the user funds are locked inside and the vaults are not visible in the application. By updating the oracle this problem would be resolved and the vaults on Harmony would be working properly.\n\n### Technical Specification\n\nBand Oracle addresses can be seen below:\n\n### Configurable Values\nBand Reference contract \nmainnet : 0xDA7a001b254CD22e46d3eAB04d937489c93174C3\ntestnet : 0xD0b2234eB9431e850a814bCdcBCB18C1093F986B",

In order to faciliate a speedy closure of all outstanding vaults, this proposal requests the use of the minimum CDR parameter to compel borrowers to repay soon.\n\n### **Motivation**\n\nChainlink is deprecating their BOO price feeds, which will not allow vaults to price their collateral. The DAO could onboard a different oracle to track BOO’s price, but its current volume is too low for loans to be safe with a different oracle.\n\n### **Specification**\n\n### **Rationale**\n\nBy deprecating the vaults before Chainlink’s price feed closure, QiDao will shield itself from any losses.\n\n### **Technical Specification**\n\nMin. CDR parameter should be gradually increased until all debt is repaid. Chainlink has not set a date for this closure. However, due to this asset's low volume, it is this proposals suggestion that the DAO offboard the few xBOO loans outstanding within 3 days of this proposal passing.\n\n### **Configurable Values**\n\n* Min. CDR upon proposal approval: 300%\n* Min. CDR one day after approval: 400%\n* Min. CDR two days after approval: 500%\n* Min CDR three days after approval: 50000%\n\nDebt ratio: 1",

      "content": "---\nqip: 223\ntitle: Drive Financial Insights via Den\nnetwork: Polygon, Base, Optimism, Arbitrum, BNB, Ethereum, Gnosis Chain, Avalanche\nauthor: Jonah Erlich\nimplementor: Guardians\ncreated: 2024-01-31\n---\n\n### Summary\n\nEnable Den's bookkeeping and financial insights features for the protocol's revenue manager multisigs\n\n### Abstract\n\nQiDAO will sign up for Den's startup tier to provide bookkeeping and financial insights software to the protocol. This will allow the protocol to have a clear understanding of its financials and to provide transparency to the community.\n\n### Motivation\n\nQiDAO's open source code and protocol provide a high-degree of financial transparency. However, this transparent data is not easily comprehensible. It's challenging to get a clear, granular understanding of the protocol's revenues, expenses, and cash flows.\n\n### Specification\n\n### Rationale\n\nQiDAO uses Den for managing it's Safe (formerly Gnosis Safe) multisigs. By enabling the accounting and financial insights features, the protocol will be able to dive deeper into transactions that are already annotated in Den. Annotations including descriptions, address book labels, and file uploads are automatically synced to bookkeeping. This annotation, combined with powerful tooling to categorize transactions and uncover financial insights, will enable the protocol to go beyond transparency and become easily comprehensible.\n\n### Pricing\n\nDen has several pricing tiers based on the number of transfers tracked per month. This excludes spam tokens and includes free historical data. The startup tier is the most appropriate for the revenue manager multisigs today. This tier is $249/month billed annually. It includes 300 transfers tracked per month, with additional transfers billed at $0.95 per transfer. Upgrading to the next tier is possible at any time if volume significantly exceeds 300 transfer per month.\n\n### References\n\nDen website: https://www.onchainden.com/\nTwitter Thread: https://twitter.com/OnChainDen/status/1749809315597394118\nFarcaster Thread: https://warpcast.com/onchainden/0x9b0cacfd",

The inaugural collaterals to be onboarded are sFRAX and sfrxETH. sFRAX should be minted via a PSM and sfrxETH via CDPs.\n\n## **Abstract**\n\nQiDao will deploy its protocol including its vaults and MAI stablecoin to Fraxtal, allowing users to create CDP vaults on the rollup as well as hold and utilize MAI how they please. To start, the first collaterals to be onboarded are sFRAX and sfrxETH.\n\n* sFRAX: [https://docs.frax.finance/frax-v3/sfrax](https://docs.frax.finance/frax-v3/sfrax)\n* sfrxETH: [https://docs.frax.finance/frax-ether/frxeth-and-sfrxeth](https://docs.frax.finance/frax-ether/frxeth-and-sfrxeth)\n\n## **Motivation**\n\nFrax and QiDao have been postive-sum partners in DeFi for nearly 2 years cooperating on a number of initiatives to increase liquidity and reduce the cost of capital across chains. As we expand onto Fraxtal, Frax Finance plans to continue our co-incentivization activities with QiDao to further strengthen our relationship. Frax will fully support the FRAXBP and WETHER programs on Fraxtal, incentivizing voters to allocate their votes towards MAI-related FRAX pools. \n\nFurthermore, if QiDao deploys on launch or soon thereafter, then QiDao Users/LPs/TVL will qualify for additional FXTL points and blockspace incentives reserved for strategic launch partners for Fraxtal.\n\n## **Specification**\n\n## **Rationale**\n\nThis proposal is straightforward, as it proposes QiDao to deploy onto Fraxtal, which will be decided via the will of the community, and then implemented if passed.\n\n## **Technical Specification**\n\nFor the oracle, Chainlink will be the primary oracle that is used to support the necessary data feeds for the QiDao protocol. As an alternative, Pyth can be used as well.\n\n### **Vault specifications for sfrxETH**\n\n* Collateral asset to be used: sfrxETH\n* Minimum collateral to debt ratio: 125%\n* Fees: (1) performance fee vault and (2) interest-charging vault. Borrow costs at both vault set to Fed Funds Rate.\n* Minimum debt: 100 MAI\n* Maximum debt: 1M MAI\n* Oracle provider: Chainlink, or Pyth, as available\n* Risk grading: B-\n* Risk methodology: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1MWyl4sD427T8_c7qYtKod5Q04ZTtKZeVf2WMtiAksw8/edit?usp=sharing",

      "content": "### **Summary**\n\nEliminate all Polygon MAI bad debt (majority comes from Fantom chain) and make the chain more self-sufficient moving forward.\n\n### **Abstract**\n\nMAI currently held in the Polygon treasury will be burned. Additional treasury assets will be used to market burn 668,984.97 MAI on Polygon.\n\n### **Motivation**\n\nPolygon is the chain with the highest TVL and most circulating MAI for QiDao. 34% of all circulating MAI is on Polygon! 62% of TVL (collateral backing Mai) is on Polygon! Eliminating all bad debt on Polygon would go a long way in restoring confidence in MAI as a stablecoin. This is critical to make the protocol more efficient/profitable. The current price of MAI on Polygon is ~$0.90. In addition to being the most important chain to eliminate bad debt on (and repeg), it is one of the closest ones to already accomplishing this. Once the bad debt is eliminated it will be more straightforward to repeg MAI on Polygon if it doesn't happen automatically.\n\n### **Rationale**\n\nRight now there is MAI sitting ideally in the treasury that would be better off being burned. Also there are tokens sitting in the treasury from dying protocols or just small quantities and selling them would simplify the treasury. These tokens would be better used to eliminate bad debt. Lastly stablecoins sitting in the treasury have not benefitted the QiDAO in the bullrun and are actually losing value daily in the form of inflation. Using these tokens for removing bad debt is better than tokens that are more likely to appreciate significantly in the next 18 months.\n\n### **Technical Specification**\n\nThe Polygon treasury has 11,148 MAI. These should be burned. QiDao's operations team will handle the rest of the process so that 668,984.97 MAI are burned. It will be up to the executor's discretion how that is achieved.",

This adjustment is deemed necessary to maintain a competitive edge, cover increased operational costs, and ensure a healthy risk-return balance.\n\n### Motivation\n\nMarket Analysis: A thorough market analysis indicates a trend towards higher interest rates in the Defi sector. By increasing borrow costs, QiDao aims to remain competitive.\n\nRisk Management: The proposed increase will contribute to a more robust risk management strategy, ensuring adequate coverage for potential market fluctuations and economic uncertainties.\n\nOperational Sustainability: The adjustment will contribute to maintaining the financial health and sustainability of QiDao.\n\nInvestor Confidence: The revised interest rate is expected to enhance investor confidence by reflecting a realistic and competitive approach to market conditions.\n\n### Specification\n\n### Rationale\n\nI believe that the proposed increase is a prudent step towards ensuring the long-term viability and success of the Protocol.\n\n### Configurable Values\n\nMAI borrow costs for V2 vaults on all chains to follow the Fed Funds Rate.

      "content": "### **Summary**\n\nThis proposal aims to deprecate all vGHST-backed MAI loans on Polygon PoS given the recently revealed events occurring with the vGHST token contract.\n\nCurrently, 32,885 MAI tokens are backed by $108,618 in vGHST globally.\n\nIt must be noted that GHST, which is issued by Aavegotchi, is unrelated to this proposal. There are no suggested changes to QiDao’s current support for GHST token vaults.\n\n### **Abstract**\n\nFor this proposal to be fully implemented, all existing loans backed by vGHST must be repaid. Since the vault contract for this collateral does not have performance fees or interest rates, deprecation functions are limited to increasing the minimum collateral to debt ratio (min. CDR) until repayment occurs.\n\n### **Motivation**\n\nIt was recently uncovered that several months ago, the vGHST token contract was upgraded by certain members of the Gotchi team with the intent to create fake deposits on QiDao’s vaults. While this upgrade was hence patched, vGHST can no longer be trusted as a safe token to back MAI.\n\n### **Rationale**\n\nDeprecating vGHST will safeguard QiDao from future malicious token upgrades.\n\n### **Configurable Values**\n\nMin. CDR upon proposal approval: 200%\nMin. CDR one day after approval: 230%\nMin. CDR two days after approval: 250%\nMin CDR three days after approval: 10000%",

      "content": "### Summary\n\nThe goal of this proposal is to approve USDM as collateral to mint MAI via a PSM vault on all Ethereum Layer 2s where available. USDM is a yield-bearing stablecoin issued by Mountain Protocol.\n\n### Abstract\n\nThis proposal builds on the PSM idea from QIP215 on Base, where MAI tokens can be minted 1:1 against approved collateral & yield from those assets is earned by the protocol as revenue. wUSDM on Layer 2s is a wrapped rebasing asset (4626 vault token), similar to wstETH, that receives rewards from Mountain Protocol, paid in USDM, currently at 5% APY. USDM is a payment token, with Reserves composed solely by short-term US treasuries held by Mountain Protocol. The token is bridged to Layer 2s using official L2 bridges.\n\nWith $140M+ USDM in issuance, USDM is the largest permissionless RWA product\nhttps://dune.com/steakhouse/tokenized-securities\n\nHere are third party reviews of USDM: \nLlamaRisk\nhttps://cryptorisks.substack.com/p/asset-risk-assessment-mountain-protocol\nBlueChip\nhttps://bluechip.org/coins/usdm\n\n### Motivation\n\n* wUSDM has risen in popularity, namely on Manta, where there is over $70M wUSDM bridged. \n* With Zero DEX launching on zkEVM, QiDao has an opportunity to initiate demand for MAI on zkEVM. MAI needs a way to be minted that strictly enforces its peg while initially liquidity levels are low. This minting method should cover the cost of incentivizing liquidity.\n\n### Specification\n\n#### Rationale\n\n*ROI on minted MAI*\n\nOnboarding USDM as collateral in a PSM will earn QiDao around 5% APR on every MAI minted via this method. The unit cost of MAI on Layer 2s should be very low cost of capital for incentivizing liquidity on available ve3,3 DEXs. This dynamic lends for a profitable opportunity for the DAO to mint have MAI be minted with USDM.\n\n*Low barrier to mint*\n\nA PSM creates a very low barrier for users to mint MAI, as users don’t need to enter into a collateralized debt position against volatile assets. This should allow for MAI to bootstrap deep liquidity pools for MAI lending to occur.\n\n*Peg*\n\nBeing fully redeemable, MAI minted via the PSM will see much less fluctuations than MAI that is not redeemable. This will help build confidence for holding MAI while in its initial growth period on zkEVM.\n\n### Technical Specification\n\n#### PSM specifications\n\n* The ability for users to deposit whitelisted tokens and receive MAI in return.\n* A fee setter for deposit fees and withdraw fees\n* Limit the deposit of collateral to whitelisted strategies, which require Guardian signatures for implementation and QIP votes for approval\n* The ability to retain accrued interest earned by the protocol\n* Withdraw functions for retained interest to be collected by treasury\n* Epoch-styled withdrawals\n* wUSDM to be priced on its redemption rate",

      "title": "QIP217: Liquity Mining Changes on Polygon PoS",
      "content": "### Summary\n\nThis proposal aims to create a sustainable system of token flows for QiDao on Polygon PoS (“PoS”). The proposed change is to allocate all revenues from QiDao’s PoS deployment to MAI liquidity mining on that chain, to fully replace any other liquidity mining done by the protocol on PoS. It would also replace other revenue sharing charters for PoS: aveQI and MAI buybacks.\n\n### Abstract\n\nThe change involves the following:\n\n* Halting current liquidity mining programs at Retro and Curve, which are funded with treasury assets.\n* Allocating all revenue from PoS to incentivizing MAI liquidity. DEX partners would be chosen based on the highest efficiency of incentivization, smart contract risk, and ability to attract liquidity providers.\n\n### Motivation\n\nCurrently, the DAO spends around $377,000 / year on PoS incentives, and makes only $17,573 / year from performance fees & an average of $40,000 / year from repayment fees. \n\nThis difference is mainly due to low loan fees from V1 vaults, which return 0.5% to the DAO upon repayment. Importantly, these vaults do not have ongoing performance or interest fees.\n\nThe funds that are being used to incentivize MAI on PoS could be put to better use on other chains where there are more immediate opportunities for growth and revenue. These include Polygon zkEVM, among others.\n\n### Specification\n\n#### Rationale\n\nThis proposal ensures that the DAO will no longer spend more funds than it makes on Polygon PoS.\n\n#### Technical Specification\n\nNo technical specifications. Only operational changes.",

Since the vault contract for this collateral is under QiDao V1, deprecation functions are limited to increasing the minimum collateral to debt ratio (min. CDR) until repayment occurs.\n\n### Motivation\n\nChainlink is deprecating their QUICK price feeds, which will not allow vaults to price their collateral. The DAO could onboard a different oracle to track QUICK’s price, but its current volume is too low for loans to be safe with a different oracle.\n\n### Specification\n\n### Rationale\n\nBy deprecating the vaults before Chainlink’s price feed closure, QiDao will shield itself from any losses.\n\n### Technical Specification\n\nMin. CDR parameter should be gradually increased until all debt is repaid. The last day that the Chainlink price feed will be live is Jan 24th. Under this proposal, the deadline to repay will be set 3 days after approval. On that day, the min.

      "content": "### Summary\n\nThe goal of this QIP is to onboard a peg stability module (PSM) vault to mint MAI, in order to improve the stability of MAI’s peg as well as increase confidence in MAI farmers.\n\n### Abstract\n\nThis PSM would allow users to deposit approved tokens to mint MAI. The tokens stored in the PSM will earn yield for the protocol. This yield will offset the cost of capital associated with MAI tokens minted through this method, as well as generate a new revenue stream for the protocol. The first PSM would be on Base, with cUSDC via Beefy Finance as the first approved strategy. cUSDC earns interest and liquidity mining rewards from Compound Finance. PSMs may be added to other chains only once bad debt from Fantom is cleared from those chains.\n\n### Motivation\n\n*Confidence in MAI*\n\nBad debt from Fantom operations as well as the resulting depeg of MAI has affected confidence in yield farmers. This can be seen in the high market equilibrium APRs on MAI LPs. This presents a challenge to QiDao’s unit economics. The higher the yield that the market demands, the more QiDao needs to charge on loans to remain profitable.\n\n*Return on minted MAI*\n\nQiDao earns less than 3% effective APR on all of its loans. This is less than the risk free rate that can be earned by DAI’s saving rate or directly via RWAs.\n\n*Core principles*\n\nIt is imperative that MAI be stable and that markets have confidence in holding MAI. That is central to any stablecoin design, as it reduces the risk premium demanded by parties to participate in the stablecoin system. Additionally, QiDao needs to aim at having profitable unit economics. While profitability does not need to come in the short term if the protocol is implementing growth strategies, it does eventually need to be attained.\n\n### Specification\n\n### Rationale\n\n*Raising confidence in holding MAI*\n\nBy adding a PSM to QiDao, MAI holders will have the option to redeem their MAI tokens for other established stablecoins. This redemption option will allow stablecoin farmers the ability to access MAI yield without having full exposure to MAI’s peg, thereby raising confidence in MAI yield opportunities.\n\n*Increasing the protocol’s return on minted MAI*\n\nEvery MAI minted via this PSM could earn the protocol at least 5% APR via known yield sources such as the DAI savings rate or lending markets such as Aave and Compound. This rate is much higher than what QiDao is currently earning in any of its loans. Adding a PSM will set a floor for loans at 5%, given the opportunity cost to the DAO.\n\n### Technical Specification\n\n*PSM specifications*\n\n* The ability for users to deposit whitelisted tokens and receive MAI in return.\n* A fee setter for deposit fees and withdraw fees\n* Limit the deposit of collateral to whitelisted strategies, which require Guardian signatures for implementation and QIP votes for approval\n* The ability to retain accrued interest earned by the protocol\n* Withdraw functions for retained interest to be collected by treasury\n* Epoch-styled withdrawals\n\n### Quorum Standards\n\nThe option with the most votes will be adopted.\n\n### Options\n\n* Approve proposal\n* Further discussions needed\n* Abstain",

The reasonings for this goal are the following:\n\nSet cost of MAI loans on par with the cost on other stablecoin projects\nStabilize MAI at its current TVL and level of expenditure on Ethereum\nAllow the protocol to onboard new loans. Per QIP209, QiDao can only enable loans on chains where MAI is at peg.\n\nBelow are the average loan costs for comparable collaterals at peer protocols.\n\n* yvLINK: no comparable protocols. GHO offers 5.36% for regular LINK in open p2p lending pool\n* ETH Curve LPs: no comparable protocols\n* WBTC: MIM (7% interest), GHO (5.36% interest), DAI (5.78% interest)\n* WETH: MIM (7% interest), GHO (5.36% interest), DAI (5.53% interest)\n* wstETH: GHO (5.36% interest), DAI (5.24% interest)\n* cbETH: GHO (5.36% interest)\n* LDO: GHO (5.78% interest)\n\nNote: GHO is a comparable stablecoin by size, but not by product, given that third party users can borrow collaterals from pools. This is different from the CDP offering at QiDao.\n\nOn Ethereum, collateralization levels are much higher than on L2s. As such, the performance fees on loans on L1 do not need to be as high in order to reach the 5% ROI threshold. For context, these are the weighted average collateralizations for each of the collaterals where performance fees will be applied:\n\n* cbETH: 308%\n* wstETH: No open loans\n* stETH Curve LPs: 450%\n\n### Fees\n\n* WETH: \nCurrent: 0.5% repayment fee\nUpdate: 5% interest, no repayment fee\n* WBTC:\nCurrent: 0.5% repayment fee\nUpdate: 5% interest, no repayment fee\n* yvWETH:\nCurrent: 0.5% repayment fee\nUpdate: 5% interest, no repayment fee\n* yvLINK:\nCurrent: 0.5% repayment fee\nUpdate: 5% interest, no repayment fee\n* sd-stETH-ETH (original):\nCurrent: 0.5% repayment fee\nUpdate: 5% interest, no repayment fee\n* yv-stETH-ETH (original):\nCurrent: 0.5% repayment fee\nUpdate: 5% interest, no repayment fee\n* sd-stETH-ETH:\nCurrent: 0.36% performance fee, 0.5% repayment fee\nUpdate: 1% performance fee, 0.5% repayment fee\n* yv-stETH-ETH:\nCurrent: 0.49% performance fee, 0.5% repayment fee\nUpdate: 1% performance fee, 0.5% repayment fee\n* cvx-stETH-ETH:\nCurrent: 0.44% performance fee, 0.5% repayment fee\nUpdate: 1% performance fee, 0.5% repayment fee\n* CRV:\nCurrent: 11% interest\nUpdate: 11% interest\n* cbETH: \nCurrent: 0.81% performance fee, 0.5% repayment fee\nUpdate: 1.5% performance fee, 0.5% repayment fee\n* stETH: \nCurrent: 0.8% performance fee, 0.5% repayment fee\nUpdate: 1.5% performance fee, 0.5% repayment fee\n* LDO: \nCurrent: 4% interest\nUpdate: 8% interest\n\n### Terms\n\nNew vote is required to update these fees\n\n### Quorum Standards\n\nThe option with the most votes will be adopted.\n\n### Options\n\n* Approve proposal\n* Further discussions needed\n* Abstain",

This will serve to better inform existing stakeholders and attract new ones while building out the open-source data infrastructure for the community.\n\n### Proposal breakdown\n\nBrief Quarterly Reports:\n\n4 reports on QI DAO that present and analyze KPIs and fundamental metrics including:\n* Key metrics table: Total Deposits, Total Borrows, Total Repays, Total Withdraws, Protocol Revenue, Number of Pools, Number of Active Users.\n* Collateral Breakdown Chart: Daily Collateral share by token group and chain.\n* Vault Health Chart: Daily Collateralization ratios across the 5 largest pools  by value\n* Protocol Revenue Chart: Daily revenues by chain and total revenue moving average\n* DAUs Chart: Daily active users by chain\n* Deposits/Withdraws chart: Daily deposits and withdraws by token group and chain\n* Borrow/Repay chart: Daily MAI borrowed and repaid\n* Key Events: Major partnerships, launches, and releases will be highlighted\n* Each report will include 4 charts out of the selection listed above, as well as 3 qualitative events. \n\nExample report: https://messari.io/report/osmosis-q3-2023-brief?referrer=protocol-reporting-research\n\n### QiDao Dashboard\n\n* Link to existing dashboard: https://messari.io/project/mai-finance/profile\n* Messari will coordinate with core contributors at QiDao to ensure that the information on this dashboard is correct.\n\n### Pricing\n\n* $7,500 will be charged per report\n* Payment will be made to an address specified by the Messari team following approval.\n* Accepted tokens: [BTC, ETH, and USDC (ERC-20)]\n\n### Resources\n\nResearch: Our analysts spend several weeks researching and writing each report, along with an extensive internal editing and review process by the broader team.\n\n### Resources Continued \n\n* Data Science and Engineering: Each report will have its own dedicated data science and engineering resources tasked with providing all the relevant raw data. This requires ingesting large amounts of data which is housed in a data warehouse, incurring storage and compute costs. \n* Distribution: We have several members of the team working on distribution for these reports across all of Messari’s channels..\n\n### Term\n\nThe term for these services will be 1 year, or 4 reports. After this period, Messari will approach the DAO for renewal.\n\n### Motivation\n\nThis initiative focuses on surfacing the on-chain metrics and key developments of Qi DAO to facilitate protocol business development. by providing regular, data-centric reports from independent analysts, your audience can gain deep insights into the protocol's performance, including daily revenue streams and significant governance changes. This transparency highlights a commitment to informing and guiding users through the intricacies of Qi DAO's operations and strategic decisions. \n\n### Quorum Standards\n\nThe option with the most votes will be adopted.\n\n### Options\n\n* Approve\n* Further discussions needed\n* Abstain",

      "title": "QIP209: Approving Community Strategy to Restabilize MAI",
      "content": "There are currently several ideas to stabilize MAI that DAO contributors have assembled via discussions on the Discord forum. These range from new protocol features to operational changes.\n\nBelow is an aggregation of these strategies. The purpose of this proposal is to approve these as the DAO’s stabilization plan.\n\n### 1. Vote to implement bridging limits for each chain\n\nMAI bridging can be limited by handling allotments to bridges. For example, QiDao’s Base deployment has no allocation for outflow or inflow bridging. Under this strategy, the DAO would place limits on the rest of the DAO’s chain deployments via QIPs. More information about bridge limits can be found in the docs here: https://docs.mai.finance/risks/chain-risk. \n\nQIPs under this strategy would need to decide on min and max circulating supply to debt ratios. They would also need to determine terms for these limits.\n\n### 2. Implement stability pool for liquidations: sMAI\n\nA stability pool would allow MAI holders priority access to liquidating debt positions that fall below the liquidation threshold. Aside from earning liquidation fees, MAI depositors into sMAI could be further incentivized by the protocol. These incentives could range from direct emissions to lock-based rewards. An implementation QIP will need to be passed to approve the final version of sMAI.\n\n### 3. Use 50% of weekly protocol revenue to buyback MAI\n\n50% of revenue is currently directed towards aveQI stakers on Ethereum. The remaining 50% of weekly revenue will be allocated towards MAI buybacks if this proposal passes.\n\n### 4. Pause borrowing on chains where MAI is depegged\n\nBy pausing further minting of MAI on chains where MAI is already depegged, the DAO can prevent shorting and further sell pressure on MAI.\n\n### 5. Continue to expand borrowing on chains where MAI is not depegged\n\nIn order to continue to scale revenue, QiDao should continue to grow the protocol on chains where MAI is not deppeged. These chains include the burgeoning new L2s like Scroll, zkEVM, Linea, Base, and Mantle (among others). The growing revenue will contribute to the flow of MAI buybacks by the DAO.\n\n### Quorum standards\n\nThe option with the most votes will be adopted.\n\n### Options\n\n* Approve proposal\n* Further discussions needed\n* Abstain",

      "title": "QIP208: Establish New Voting Power Standard",
      "content": "### Abstract\n\nThis proposal seeks to establish a new voting standard around aveQI, QiDao’s new locking mechanism for QI. Under this standard, only aveQI holders will be able to vote on DAO proposals. \n\n### These are the aims of the proposal:\n\n* Address the incompatibility of using two different tokens when constructing voting power, QI-ETH and QI\n* Move QiDao closer to automation via onchain voting and onchain execution of proposals. This would occur via QiDao XChain Protocol, discussed here: https://qidaoprotocol.medium.com/a-new-paradigm-for-crosschain-projects-powered-by-qidao-and-chainlink-ccip-12779c706ef8\n\n### Background\n\nCurrently, the DAO accepts votes from all QI holders on any chain, as well as QI lockers. Voting occurs offchain via a Snapshot strategy that tallies each user’s voting power. Now that QI lockers have both QI and ETH in their locks, a compatibility issue has arised. This is due to the existing voting standard only counting QI holdings when calculating voting power.\n\n### Roadmap for voting at QiDao\n\nThis proposal will be one of several addressing the question of DAO proposals at QiDao. Below is an overview of the components that will make up the proposal process. Note that the list below is for illustrative purposes. The DAO will need to approve every component.\n\n*Voting power standard*\n\nAddressed by the current proposal, this component deals with who can vote and how their voting power will be assessed.\n\n*Proposal creation and editing process*\n\nQiDao uses Discord for both discussions and editing of proposals. A standard will be set via governance vote to decentralize this process further. The guiding principle is for this process to efficiently log contributions and suggestions from DAO contributors within the proposal brainstorming process. Additionally, this should allow contributors to easily post their own proposals.\n\n*Proposal execution*\n\nAt the time of writing, the DAO leverages Aave’s Guardian standard for executing proposal decisions. This is done via a multisig of highly-respected contributors in web3, internal QiDao team, as well as a community representative from QiDao. The future QiDao will still allow for Guardians to safeguard the protocol in emergency situations. However, the bulk of proposal executions should not have to involve human execution. Instead, proposals should be executed automatically. The DAO will use its internally-built XChain Protocol module on Safe to facilitate this process, if the community approves.\n\n### Quorum standard\n\nThe option with the most votes will be adopted.\n\n### Options\n\n* Approve\n* Further discussions needed\n* Abstain",

Vaults whose min CDRs reach below this figure are eligible for liquidation.\n\nThe weighted average collateral to debt ratio of these vaults is as follows:\n\n* Stake DAO USD Avalanche: 137.14%\n* Stake DAO USD Polygon: 130.09%\n* camDAI Polygon: 129.71%\n* mooAaveDAI Optimism: 114.05%\n\n### Method for Promoting Repayments\n\nGiven the limited function of these earlier vault versions, this proposal seeks to increase the min CDRs of these vaults until all MAI debt is repaid.\n\nRepayment fees will be reduced to 0%, as an inducement for repayments.\n\nAfter one week from the approval of this proposal, a 1% daily increase in the min CDR vaults will begin. Under this schedule, it would take close to 30 days for the weighted average vault to reach the liquidation threshold.\n\n### Motivation\n\n* Offboard unprofitable vaults: these vaults do not charge performance fees, as do gDAI vaults. They also do not meaningfully contribute to the overall collateralization of MAI.\n\n* Improve MAI’s peg. These vaults hold almost 600k MAI debt. Repayment of these loans should result in buy pressure for MAI.\n\n### Quorum Standards\n\nThe option with the most votes will be adopted.\n\n### Options\n\n* Approve proposal\n* Reject proposal\n* Abstain",

      "content": "This proposal seeks to modify QIP198, which approved the implementation of aveQI.\n\nPlease see the QIP198 for additional context and a detailed description of the migration process.\n\n### Proposed changes\n\nMigrate eQI to a QI-WETH LP on Ethereum, instead of forming a QI-WMATIC LP on Polygon PoS.\n\nIf this proposal is approved, QI will become native to Ethereum. QI on other chains will be bridged using official bridges. Users with QI balances outside of escrowedQI will be given new QI tokens based on a snapshot taken prior to migration.\n\n### Transaction fee considerations\n\nGiven varying transaction fees on chains, a few thresholds need to be put in place for QI’s migration.\n\n* Threshold to receive QI-ETH position on Ethereum: 500 QI\n* Threshold to receive QI on Polygon for eQI position on Polygon, instead of a QI-ETH LP on Ethereum: 50 QI\n* Threshold to receive QI on each chain. 50 QI on all chains except for Arbitrum, Optimism, and Avalanche. Those chains will have a threshold of 75 QI.\n\nQI holders must meet one of these categories to receive the new version of QI.\n\n### Motivation\n\n*Chain-specific risk:* QiDao’s main LP and governance tool should exist on the chain with the highest degree of security and stability.\n\nEthereum has proven to be the optimal chain in this regard for the following reasons:\n\n* The nakamoto coefficient for Ethereum is much greater than that of other chains and L2s. This makes sudden, unilateral actions improbable\n* Having a large set of contributors and community members, changes to Ethereum are subject to much greater scrutiny and receive considerably more feedback\n\n*Addressable market:* most activity on the blockchain currently exists on Ethereum mainnet, as does most of the blockchain’s total value locked. Moving QiDao’s main LP to Ethereum will significantly increase the DAO’s total addressable market, allowing it to onboard a larger community. Keeping QiDao’s core LP outside of Ethereum will only hamper the protocol’s growth.\n\n*Low project risk:* WETH is a better alternative to an ETH liquid-staking token (LST), since it does not carry the project-specific risk that such a token has. LST projects are fairly new and carry far greater trust assumptions than WETH itself. These assumptions include lower decision-maker count, reliance on teams for secondary market maintenance, and additionally smart contracts.\n\n### Quorum Standard\n\nThe option with the most votes will be implemented.\n\n### Options\n\n* Approve proposal\n* Further discussions needed\n* Abstain",

The protocol will increase the Collateral to Debt Ratio (CDR) over time and adjust oracle price sources for accurate market representation.\n\n### Implementation:\n\nEnable the guardian multisig to manage the current vaults based on the following:\n\n- Adjust CDR:\nGradually raise collateral requirements for lending and borrowing.\nConduct risk assessment considering market conditions and liquidity.\nTransparently communicate changes to users.\n\n- Adjust Oracle Price Sources: \nUpdate sources to reflect current market liquidity (such including TWAP and/or PoR oracles)\nIntegrate reliable data feeds and ensure accuracy.\nPromptly respond to market changes.\n- Lowering repayment fee to 0.1%\n- Increasing debt repayment upon liquidation\n\n### Rationale:\n\nTo mitigate risks and protect users, we propose increasing the CDR and adjusting oracle prices. This will improve protocol stability amid the Multichain bridge issues.\n\n ### Quorum:\n\nThe options with most votes will be implemented. Expedite execution of this proposal may be approved before the end date if Quorum reaches 20M QiPowah.\n\n### Options:\n\nImplement Measures\nAbstain\nFurther discussions needed\n\n### Note:\nThis proposal only applies to the Fantom blockchain deployment.",

It allows users to deposit tokens (in our case QI/MATIC LP), lock them for a specified period, increase the lock amount, extend the lock duration, and withdraw tokens after the lock expires. The contract also provides methods for calculating voting power and total supply at specific points in time.\n\n**FeeDistributor.sol:** This contract is responsible for distributing fees collected. It receives fees from various sources (support various tokens) and distributes them to the designated recipients based on predefined rules. The FeeDistributor contract can interact with the VotingEscrow contract to determine the voting power of users and allocate fees accordingly.\n\nFinal drafts of the contracts can be found in the GitHub repository shared above.\n\n### Quorum Standards\n\nThe option with the most votes will be adopted. The Abstain option counts towards voting participation, but is not an option that can be adopted.\n\n### Options\n\n* Approve Implementation\n* Reject Implementation\n* Abstain",

      "title": "QIP197: Activation of QiDao Guardians Initiative",
      "content": "### Introduction\n\nThe proposed \"QiDao Guardians\" initiative is designed to bring together key contributors from our protocol and entities from the broader crypto space, creating a robust 4/6 multisig mechanism. Inspired by Aave Guardians, the QiDao Guardians will serve as a safety component of the protocol, ensuring the integrity and security of the QiDao ecosystem.\n\nThe name \"Guardians\" reflects their vigilant watchfulness and commitment to proactively safeguard the QiDao ecosystem, combining their comprehensive understanding of decentralized finances with their contributions to the protocol.\n\n### Overview\n\nThe QiDao Guardians will be integrants of a multisig that serves as admin for MAI, QI, and Vault contracts. Decisions related to the management of these contracts will still be handled by governance. This multisig will also have a specific timelock for critical functions to delay executions, adding another layer of decentralization and security to the protocol.\n\nIn line with the ethos of QiDao, the Guardians are intended to:\n\n* Protect QiDao Protocol against potential governance attacks.\n* Manage the minting and burning of MAI to handle debt ceilings for collateral vaults\n* Manage bridge diversification allocations for both MAI and QI.\n* Act as a failsafe emergency actor if necessary\n\nFurthermore, Guardians are also expected to:\n\n* Engage actively in multisig operations by being alert, responsive, and swift in action when necessary.\n* Uphold the protocol's best interest, promptly disclosing any potential conflict of interests.\n\n### QiDao Guardians composition\n\nCurrent\n\n* 0xNacho from QiDao Community\n* Benjamin.lens from QiDao Protocol\n* Pablo the Penguin from QiDao Protocol\n* Lao zi from QiDao Protocol **(to be removed if this proposal passes)**\n\nPotential additions - All, some, or none of the signers below could be added to QiDao Guardians.\n\n* Marc Zeller from Aave Chan Initiative\n* Hamzah Khan from Polygon Labs\n* Weso from Beefy Finance\n\n### Implementation\n\nThe inception of this initiative is contingent upon the approval of this proposal. Should it pass, existing multisigs will be adapted for implementation. Any alterations to the multisig composition must be adequately communicated to the community in advance.\n\n### Implementation requirements\n\n* Activation of the QiDao Guardians\n* Addition of the Timelock to the multisig\n\n### Quorum Standards\n\nFor an option to be approved, it must receive over 50% approval. \n\n* If reject receives over 50% approve, the 4 original signers will remain.\n* If 1 new signer is approved, Guardians will consist of 4 signers, 3 required to execute.\n* If 2 new signers are approved, Guardians will consist of 5 signers, 4 required to execute.\n* If 3 new signers are approved, Guardians will consist of 6 signers, 4 required to execute.\n\n### Voting Guide\n\nTo approve signers, select each signer that you wish to approve. You may choose some, all, or none of the signers listed in the options. You may also reject the proposal, which will maintain the current signer setup.\n\nAbstain option is listed for those that wish to participate on the vote but do not want to influence the decision. Abstain does not count towards the proposal decision.",

      "title": "QIP188: Migrate eQI to LP Locking",
      "content": "### Background\n\n19 months ago, in July 2021, QiDao launched its QI locking - escrowed QI. This was an internally-built product based on several other governance frameworks at the time. It allowed QiDao to incentivize the locking of QI by boosting both voting power and revenue distributions. The initial goal was to have at least 50% of QI locked. Currently, close to 70% of QI has been locked for an average of almost 3 years.\n\nIn parallel, QiDao runs a liquidity mining campaign to maintain QI liquidity (QI-MATIC). This LP allows users to buy and sell QI, and sets the price of QI. The LM campaign costs QiDao 180,000 QI per week, or $18,000 per week. This accounts for 30.72% of total QI emissions. Such an expense is not sustainable, especially given unpredictable market conditions. The DAO needs a better model for maintaining QI liquidity. Switching to a third-party liquidity pool locking product would be a step in the right direction.\n\n### Overview\n\n* A maximum of 5% of eQI holders’ QI will be replaced with an equal value in MATIC, resulting in a QI-MATIC LP that is valued at the same amount as the current eQI holdings\n* Proposed QI-MATIC split: 95% QI and 5% MATIC (max of 5% MATIC)\n* Price of QI: trailing 14-day average\n* One-time expense to QiDao: 226,669 MATIC at current prices\n* Yearly savings in QI emissions: $1,123,200 or 9,360,000 QI\n* A new QI token will be created on Polygon to facilitate the migration. This does not mean that users will necessarily receive a new token. Options exist to migrate QI to a new token without users having to \"receive\" a new token. \n\n### Balancer Option\n\nThe Balancer team approached QiDao several weeks ago about migrating eQI to Balancer, via it’s 80/20 locking product. This product has similar characteristics with eQI, being a locking mechanism that boosts both voting power and revenue distributions. The only change is that LPs are being locked instead of the sole governance token.\n\n### Impermanent loss\n\nThis migration would introduce impermanent loss (IL) to eQI holders. This IL is expected to be between 0% and 0.5% under normal to moderate trading conditions. Under severe price volatility, IL is expected to reach 1%. Using this link, you can view the effects of price movements on IL for Balancer: https://baller.netlify.app/\n\nQiDao will apply to Balancer’s 80/20 grant in order to cover the cost of IL. The expected APR at current price is between 1% to 3%. This should be more than enough to cover IL. More information about the grant program can be found here: https://snapshot.org/#/balancer.eth/proposal/0x3708b9fcb085bccc6ebb9e9708c6e45528a85b22483da9bbdcc0b606103429fb\n\n### References\n\nBalancer 80/20 intro: https://medium.com/balancer-protocol/80-20-balancer-pools-ad7fed816c8d\n\nFurther reading:\nhttps://medium.com/balancer-protocol/liquidity-after-bootstrapping-ffc7856d5c8e\n\n### DEX Selection\n\nFinal DEX selection will depend on our ability to collaborate and partner with specific DEXs, as well as their governance layers. It is important that QiDao remain flexible on this point, given the unpredictability of external DAOs.\n\n### Exit Early Option\n\nAn \"exit early\" option allows users to leave their eQI lock before the locking time has elapsed. For example, a user with 3 years left on their lock would be able to withdraw their QI before the 3 years have passed. This option could offer users that do not want to participate in the migration to LP locking a way out. If this option is passed, then a follow up QIP will decide the details of this option.\n\n### Quorum Standards\n\nApproval of this QIP will be based on the combined votes to \"Approve migration\" and \"Approve migration + exit early option\" versus the other options. If the approve options have the majority, then the approve option with most votes will be adopted.\n\n### Options\n\n* Approve migration\n* Further discussions needed\n* Approve migration + exit early option\n* Abstain",

      "title": "QIP189: Create a Liquidity Mining Budget",
      "content": "The objective is to significantly enhance the efficiency of liquidity mining for MAI by more than 2x through voting incentives. QiDao's aim is to establish a budget for voting incentives on Solidly/Velodrome forks without raising QI's overall emissions.\n\n**All resources for this budget will be sourced from existing direct emissions that are not being optimally utilized currently.**\n\nIn the past, QiDao utilized masterchefs to incentivize liquidity providers directly, but it now intends to employ voting incentives on Solidly/Velodrome forks. This new strategy of incentivizing liquidity is more effective than masterchefs, as the final rewards given to liquidity providers are considerably greater than the emissions from the incentivizing protocol.\n\nTo become a major player in DEXs, MAI requires a voting incentives budget for converting LPs into MAI pairs. QiDao is in a unique position since it is the most widely used decentralized stablecoin and often receives voting allocations from new Solidly/Velodrome forks.\n\n### Current efficiency of voting incentives vs direct emissions\n\nCurrent voting incentives compared to direct emissions demonstrate a stark contrast. The Return on Incentive (ROI) for voting incentives is much higher compared to direct emissions.\n\n*Voting incentives*\n\n* Thena MAI-FRAX: 34x ROI\n* Equilibre MAI-USDC: 118x ROI\n* Velodrome (several pools): 2.58x to 8.32x\n* Aura MAI-USDC: 1.28x\n\n*Direct emissions*\n\n* QuickSwap MAI-USDC: 1x ROI\n* Curve MAI-3CRV: 1x ROI\n* Curve MAI-USDC-USDT: 1x ROI\n\nROI = Return on Incentive. In other words, for every dollar of QI emissions, how many rewards LPers receive.\n\n### Terms\n\nThis budget will be voted at the end of every quarter to reevaluate performance. The budget does not need to be used completely. It should be adjusted for MAI’s market cap and peg.\n\n### Current QI emissions to MAI\n\nTotaI: 271,750 / week\n\n*Masterchefs*\n\n* 120,000 / week on MAI-USDC QuickSwap\n* 50,000 / week on MAI-USDT-USDC Curve\n* 50,000 / week MAI-USDC Uniswap V3\n* 10,000 / week on MAI-3CRV Curve\n\n*Bribes*\n\n* 15,000 / week on MAI-USDC Aura/Balancer\n* 3,750 / week on MAI-LUSD Velodrome\n* 3,000 / week on MAI-FRAX Thena\nOther\n* 20,000 / week on MAI-gDAI KyberSwap\n\n### Proposed new allocations\n\nTotal: 271,750 / week\n\n*Masterchefs*\n\n* 50,000 / week on MAI-USDC Uniswap V3\n* 25,000 / week on MAI-USDT-USDC Curve\n* 10,000 / week on MAI-3CRV Curve\n\n*Bribes*\n\n* 166,750 / week budget for bribing and incentivizing across all chains (not necessarily to be used fully)\n\n*Other*\n\n* 20,000 / week on MAI-gDAI KyberSwap \n\n### Quorum Standards\n\nThe option with the most votes will be adopted.\n\n### Options\n\n* Approve proposal\n* Reject proposal\n* Abstain\n",

      "content": "This proposal seeks a QI allocation for a new gDAI-MAI-USDC pool on Balancer Arbitrum. \n\n**No net increase in QI emissions will result from this proposal**\n\n**Allocation:** Up to 20k QI per week, with a cap of $2k based on QI price\n\n**Method of distribution:** voting incentives for Balancer DAO. These incentives will be used via Tetu, which currently has the highest ROI for Balancer incentives. If another solution becomes more profitable, QiDao will switch to that solution.\n\nThe allocation would be taken from current pools to keep emissions unchanged. The sources of the allocation are detailed below:\n\n* All incentives currently used on Balancer’s MAI-DAI-USDT-USDC LP on Polygon (9k QI per week / 18k QI per epoch)\n* 50% of incentives from Curve’s MAI+av3CRV LP on Avalanche, equaling 10k QI per week\n* 1k QI / week from MAI-USDC on QuickSwap, a 0.83% cut\n\nGains Network will match QiDao’s incentives starting with $2k per week.\n\n### Motivation\n\n* QiDao is soon to add gDAI as collateral on Arbitrum. Other collaterals in the works, including staked ETH LPs on Curve. MAI will need sufficient liquidity on Arbitrum to ensure smooth liquidations for these new vaults\n* Partnering with Gains will increase the amount of liquidity QiDao can lock for the same amount of rewards\n* The size of Avalanche’s MAI pool is larger than needed given the amount of MAI debt on that chain\n* The cut from QuickSwap is negligible and allows QiDao to meet the requirements of this deal with Gains Network\n* The current pool on Balancer Polygon is not needed. MAI’s main liquidity on Polygon is QuickSwap, UniSwap, and KyberSwap. A fourth base of liquidity only fragments liquidity.\n\n### Quorum Standards\n\nThe option with the most votes will be adopted.\n\n### Options\n\n* Approve proposal\n* Further discussions needed\n* Abstain",

      "title": "QIP184: Change the Liquidation Process for V2 Vaults",
      "content": "Author: Pablo the Penguin\n\n### Background:\n\nThe QiDao Protocol currently utilizes a liquidation process where vaults that fall below the minimum collateral to debt ratio (CDR) are liquidated by partially repaying the debt and receiving a bonus in collateral tokens. The current process is a repayment of 50% of the debt and a bonus of 10% of the collateral tokens.\n\n### Problem:\n\nThe problem is that the current liquidation repayment process leads to disproportionate losses for users in comparison to the amount needed to maintain a loan in good standing, particularly during periods of high volatility. This poses a challenge for maintaining the overall health of the loans while minimizing user loss.\n\n### Proposed Solution:\n\nTo address the problem of disproportionate user loss during the liquidation process, we propose changing the liquidation repayment amount from 50% + 10% bonus to a minimum of 10% + 10% bonus. The minimum repayment amount would vary by chain and collateral type, and would be defined by the risk committee. The guiding factor for these parameters would be the average size of debt positions, mainly to maintain the attractiveness of liquidating small vaults.\n\nThis would decrease the user loss without affecting the overall health of the loans for vaults with high debt amounts, while still ensuring full repayment for vaults with low debt amounts. \n\nThis solution aims to balance the needs of both the users and the loan system, by reducing the liquidation repayment amount for high debt vaults while still providing a bonus to incentivize good behavior. Additionally, it could decrease the risk of multiple liquidations during periods of high volatility, improve user retention and increase trust in the loan system\n\n\n### Benefits:\n\nMinimization of user loss: Reducing the liquidation repayment amount from 50% to 10% would significantly decrease the financial loss for users.\nMaintaining the overall health of the loans: The proposed solution still includes a 10% bonus, which would provide an incentive for users to maintain their loans in good standing.\n\nBalancing the needs of users and the loan system: By reducing the liquidation repayment amount while still providing a bonus, the solution aims to balance the needs of users and the loan system.\n\nReducing the risk of liquidations during periods of high volatility: With smaller liquidation repayment amount, it would be less likely to trigger multiple liquidations during periods of high volatility.\n\nImproving user retention: With less financial loss, users are more likely to stay on the platform and continue to use the loan service.\n\n### Implementation Plan:\n\nAssess the current liquidation repayment process and gather data on the average debt amount of vaults and the proportion of user loss during liquidation.\nRisk committee to determine the minimum debt threshold, such as 10k on Ethereum, below which the liquidation repayment would be 100% and which the proposed 10% bonus would still apply.\n\nBacktest the proposed variables of reducing the liquidation repayment amount for vaults with debt above the minimum debt threshold.\nImplement the proposed solution and monitor its effectiveness in decreasing user loss and maintaining the overall health of the loans.\n\n### Voting Options\n\n* Approve proposal\n* Further discussions needed\n* Abstain",

      "content": "Author: Benjamin.lens\n\nThe time has come to end QI vault incentives for minting MAI. This proposal seeks approval to end all QI emissions to the vault incentives program.\n\n### Motivation\n\n*Incentives*\n\nCurrently, the DAO emits 150k QI per week for the purposes of incentivizing the minting of MAI against approved collaterals. At current market prices, this equals $15k and represents 26% of QI emissions. During the bull market, this system allowed QiDao to grow its TVL and created a thriving vote incentives ecosystem. The last 2 voting rounds have yielded 1.2% and 2.6% in annualized returns from voting incentives. \n\nAs market conditions worsen, this system has become unprofitable for QiDao. Below is a breakdown of the revenue dynamics.\n\n*Revenue dynamics*\n\nVaults that have received more than 5% of vault incentives over the past 15 weeks, accounting for as much as 97% of vault incentives in any given week, represent only 38.97% of repayment fee revenue. This means that 61.03% of repayment fee revenue comes from virtually non-incentivized vaults. Out of these vaults with low to no incentives, DAI and WETH-related vaults account for most of revenue.\n\n*Mitigants*\n\nThe most recent collateral additions have received grants for partner vault incentives. So far, LDO, OP, and METIS have been received for incentivizing minting MAI. Moving forward, the BD team will push for these sorts of deals. This way, QiDao will remove the need to have QI vault incentives.\n\n*Competitive landscape*\n\nMany of the assets onboarded to QiDao, like Curve LPs and yvTokens, are not accepted by other major lending and stablecoin platforms. Hence, there’s no competition for such deposits. For assets like stETH, ETH, and BTC, which are accepted by other stablecoins and lending platforms, QiDao is by far the cheapest option for borrowing without any incentives.\n\n### Quorum Standards\n\nThe option with the most votes will be adopted.\n\n### Options\n\nEnd QI vault incentives\nFurther discussions needed",

      "title": "QIP179: Migrate MAI-USDC to QuickSwap V3",
      "content": "MAI’s largest pool sits on QuickSwap V2. At $12.6M in TVL, the pool generates daily volume under $20k per day. This is extremely inefficient for MAI. Additionally, this LP is based on the UniSwap V2 model, which is not known to help with stablecoin pegs.\n\nOur proposal is to migrate this farm to QuickSwap V3, using Gamma to manage the LP positions. QiDao needs a manager to produce a standard ERC20 token for all liquidity providers, so that it can incentivize liquidity via a masterchef contract.\n\n### Position details\n\nRange: $0.99 to $1.01\nMidpoint: $1.00\nFee: 0.01%\n\n### Information about the position manager\n\nThe code being used to manage QuickSwap V3 positions was written by Gamma and audited by several teams. QuickSwap’s V3 was licensed from Algebra Finance’s concentrated liquidity AMM implementation.\n\n### Audits on Gamma’s product\n\nConsensys Diligence, Arbitrary Execution, Omniscia, and Certik audits can be found here along with a link to the Immunefi bounty: https://docs.gamma.xyz/gamma/learn/audits\n\n### Benefits to QiDao & MAI\n\nBetter peg management with concentrated liquidity\nLower fees will make MAI a more attractive routing token\nVolume / TVL on concentrated liquidity is much higher than on UniV2 LPs\nLess price impact on MAI trades and increased volumes via DEX aggregators\n\n### Quorum Standards\n\nThe option with the most votes will be adopted.\n\n### Options\n\nMigrate to QuickSwap V3\nFurther discussions needed",

      "title": "QIP180: Vault Incentives Gauge (Round 26)",
      "content": "Vault incentives are allocated a total of 150k Qi per week. Following QIP047 & QIP162 the distribution of these rewards among vault types will be decided every two weeks by the DAO.\n\nTo vote, you must hold Qi. You can distribute your voting power among as many and as few collateral types as you wish. The aggregate distribution of responses will be used to calculate the final distribution of rewards.\n### Quorum Standards:\n\nFollowing QIP162, a minimum allocation of 7,500 QI per week (5% of the vote) is needed for a chain to receive rewards. If the collateral types for a chain collectively do not achieve a 7,500 QI per week allocation, then their rewards will be proportionally split among the other eligible collateral types.\n\nEach vault type can get a maximum of 15% of the total incentives. Any extra percentage over 15% will be distributed among the other collaterals receiving votes in proportion to their vote share.\n\nVaults must have a minimum of 100 MAI debt to receive incentives unless the minimum borrow for a vault type is set higher.\n\nFollowing QIP177, the protocol will incentivize highly liquid collaterals to improve the strength of MAI overcollateralization. These are collaterals rated at B- or higher according to the risk assessment matrix (https://mai.watch/).

      "content": "Vault incentives are allocated a total of 150k Qi per week. Following QIP047 & QIP162 the distribution of these rewards among vault types will be decided every two weeks by the DAO.\n\nTo vote, you must hold Qi. You can distribute your voting power among as many and as few collateral types as you wish. The aggregate distribution of responses will be used to calculate the final distribution of rewards.\n### Quorum Standards:\n\nFollowing QIP162, a minimum allocation of 7,500 QI per week (5% of the vote) is needed for a chain to receive rewards. If the collateral types for a chain collectively do not achieve a 7,500 QI per week allocation, then their rewards will be proportionally split among the other eligible collateral types.\n\nEach vault type can get a maximum of 15% of the total incentives. Any extra percentage over 15% will be distributed among the other collaterals receiving votes in proportion to their vote share.\n\nVaults must have a minimum of 100 MAI debt to receive incentives unless the minimum borrow for a vault type is set higher.\n\nFollowing QIP177, the protocol will incentivize highly liquid collaterals to improve the strength of MAI overcollateralization. These are collaterals rated at B- or higher according to the risk assessment matrix (https://mai.watch/).

      "content": "Vault incentives are allocated a total of 150k Qi per week. Following QIP047 & QIP162 the distribution of these rewards among vault types will be decided every two weeks by the DAO.\n\nTo vote, you must hold Qi. You can distribute your voting power among as many and as few collateral types as you wish. The aggregate distribution of responses will be used to calculate the final distribution of rewards.\n### Quorum Standards:\n\nFollowing QIP162, a minimum allocation of 7,500 QI per week (5% of the vote) is needed for a chain to receive rewards. If the collateral types for a chain collectively do not achieve a 7,500 QI per week allocation, then their rewards will be proportionally split among the other eligible collateral types.\n\nEach vault type can get a maximum of 15% of the total incentives. Any extra percentage over 15% will be distributed among the other collaterals receiving votes in proportion to their vote share.\n\nVaults must have a minimum of 100 MAI debt to receive incentives unless the minimum borrow for a vault type is set higher.\n\nNote: Qi holders will be able to vote from any chain that has QI.\n",

Following QIP047 & QIP162 the distribution of these rewards among vault types will be decided every two weeks by the DAO.\n\nTo vote, you must hold Qi. You can distribute your voting power among as many and as few collateral types as you wish. The aggregate distribution of responses will be used to calculate the final distribution of rewards.\n### Quorum Standards:\n\nFollowing QIP162, a minimum allocation of 7,500 QI per week (5% of the vote) is needed for a chain to receive rewards. If the collateral types for a chain collectively do not achieve a 7,500 QI per week allocation, then their rewards will be proportionally split among the other eligible collateral types.\n\nEach vault type can get a maximum of 15% of the total incentives. Any extra percentage over 15% will be distributed among the other collaterals receiving votes in proportion to their vote share.\n\nVaults must have a minimum of 100 MAI debt to receive incentives unless the minimum borrow for a vault type is set higher.\n\nNote: Qi holders will be able to vote from any chain that has QI.\n",

      "content": "Vault incentives are allocated a total of 150k Qi per week. Following QIP047 & QIP162 the distribution of these rewards among vault types will be decided every two weeks by the DAO.\n\nTo vote, you must hold Qi. You can distribute your voting power among as many and as few collateral types as you wish. The aggregate distribution of responses will be used to calculate the final distribution of rewards.\n### Quorum Standards:\n\nFollowing QIP162, a minimum allocation of 7,500 QI per week (5% of the vote) is needed for a chain to receive rewards. If the collateral types for a chain collectively do not achieve a 7,500 QI per week allocation, then their rewards will be proportionally split among the other eligible collateral types.\n\nEach vault type can get a maximum of 15% of the total incentives. Any extra percentage over 15% will be distributed among the other collaterals receiving votes in proportion to their vote share.\n\nVaults must have a minimum of 100 MAI debt to receive incentives unless the minimum borrow for a vault type is set higher.\n\nNote: Qi holders will be able to vote from any chain that has QI.\n",

      "content": "Migrate Qi emissions from the MAI+3CRV pool on Curve Polygon to a MAI-USDC managed pool on Uniswap V3 Polygon.\n\nThe position would be managed by Arrakis and can be found here: https://beta.arrakis.finance/vaults/137/0xa199569af06cb68960869fe376c9b41f68d8e2d1\n\n### Motivation\n\nMAI needs to increase its volume to obtain Chainlink oracles on new chains like Ethereum, Metis, and Optimism. Having oracles on other chains will open the door for new use cases for MAI, such as more Aave listings and perpetuals collateral.\n\nCurrently, MAI’s pool on Curve Polygon produces under $40,000 of volume per day. This pool is incentivized with 50,000 QI per week. In contrast, the MAI-USDC pool on Uniswap V3 is not incentivized and produces $700,000 of volume per day.\n\nOne reason for this is the low fees on the Uniswap pool, of 0.01%. These fees are 3x lower than those on Curve. \n\n### Quorum standards\n\nThe option with the most votes will be adopted.\n\n### Options\n\nApprove proposal\nFurther discussions needed",

      "content": "Vault incentives are allocated a total of 150k Qi per week. Following QIP047 & QIP162 the distribution of these rewards among vault types will be decided every two weeks by the DAO.\n\nTo vote, you must hold Qi. You can distribute your voting power among as many and as few collateral types as you wish. The aggregate distribution of responses will be used to calculate the final distribution of rewards.\n### Quorum Standards:\n\nFollowing QIP162, a minimum allocation of 7,500 QI per week (5% of the vote) is needed for a chain to receive rewards. If the collateral types for a chain collectively do not achieve a 7,500 QI per week allocation, then their rewards will be proportionally split among the other eligible collateral types.\n\nEach vault type can get a maximum of 15% of the total incentives. Any extra percentage over 15% will be distributed among the other collaterals receiving votes in proportion to their vote share.\n\nVaults must have a minimum of 100 MAI debt to receive incentives unless the minimum borrow for a vault type is set higher.\n\nNote: Qi holders will be able to vote from any chain that has QI.\n",

On Stellaswap (the most convenient exchange for liquidating xcDOT) there is at the time of writing this almost $2m in liquidity. Note that transferring xcDOT is fast, cheap, and occurs on the Polkadot network's shared security, for liquidators that would prefer to offramp their DOT from Moonbeam.\n\n### Risk analysis\n\nxcDOT scores a B+ on QiDao's risk management matrix: https://riskmanagement.qidao.community/en/tokens/xcdot-moonbeam\n\n### Proposal: \n\nIn line with other B+ assets with deep liquidity, add xcDOT as collateral for MAI on Moonbeam with the following parameters:\n* 130% CDR\n* 1% interest rate (to QiDao)\n* 0.5% repayment fee (to Stellaswap)\n\nOther tokens that have a 130% CDR and a B+ risk rating:\n* Polygon WBTC\n* Optimism WETH\n* Avax WETH\n* Fantom WFTM\n* Arbitrum WETH\n* Avax WAVAX\n* Polygon WMATIC\n* BNB CAKE \n\n### Quorum Standards\n\nThe option with the most votes will be adopted.\n\n### Options\n\n* Add support for xcDOT\n* Further discussions needed",

If an option does not have enough votes for a 1% allocation, its allocation will be evenly distributed among other options. The Gauge results will last for 2 weeks.",

You can distribute your voting power among as many and as few collateral types as you wish. The aggregate distribution of responses will be used to calculate the final distribution of rewards.\n\n### Quorum Standards:\n\nDue to bridging fees, a minimum allocation of 15,000 QI per week (8.33% of the vote) is needed for a chain to receive rewards. If the collateral types for a chain collectively do not achieve a 15,000 QI per week allocation, then their rewards will be proportionally split among the other eligible collateral types. \n\nFollowing QIP 142, each vault type can get a maximum of 20% of the total incentives. Any extra percentage over 20% will be distributed among the other collaterals receiving votes in proportion to their vote share.\n\nNote: Qi holders will be able to vote from any chain that has QI.",

TVL on the WGLMR vault is at $16k. The issue is two-fold: users don't feel they can out earn the 8% interest rate, and the CDR of 250% is not competitive with what other platforms offer.\n\n### Proposed Changes\n\n1 - decrease the min. CDR to 150%. This is a conservative min. CDR, based on the risk matrixes for comparable chains Metis (155) and Moonriver (130) which both also score \"B-\"\n2 - Replace the 8% interest rate with a 1% interest rate, to reflect the reduced risk since launch and keep the rate competitive\n\n### Risk Analyses\n\n* Moonbeam Risk Matrix: https://riskmanagement.qidao.community/en/tokens/wglmr-moonbeam\n* Metis Risk Matrix - https://riskmanagement.qidao.community/en/tokens/metis-metis\n* MOVR Risk Matrix - https://riskmanagement.qidao.community/en/tokens/movr-moonriver\n\n### Quorum Standards\n\nThe option with the most votes will be adopted.\n\n### Options\n\n* Accept proposal\n* Further discussions needed",

Following QIP047, the distribution of these rewards among vault types will be decided every two weeks by the DAO.\n\nTo vote, you must hold Qi. You can distribute your voting power among as many and as few collateral types as you wish. The aggregate distribution of responses will be used to calculate the final distribution of rewards.\n\n### Quorum Standards:\n\nDue to bridging fees, a minimum allocation of 15,000 QI per week (8.33% of the vote) is needed for a chain to receive rewards. If the collateral types for a chain collectively do not achieve a 15,000 QI per week allocation, then their rewards will be proportionally split among the other eligible collateral types. \n\nFollowing QIP 142, each vault type can get a maximum of 20% of the total incentives. Any extra percentage over 20% will be distributed among the other collaterals receiving votes in proportion to their vote share.\n\nNote: Qi holders will be able to vote from any chain that has QI.",

      "content": "QiDao collects repayment fees (0.5% of repaid debt). Currently, 70% is maintained within the treasury, while 30% is sold for QI on the open market and distributed to eQi stakers. \n\neQI staking APY has fallen during the bear market. The estimates of the QIP writers, it used to be around 50% or higher for the 4 year lock. It is now around 7% over the past month, which dissuades users from staking and locking their QI - an action that is beneficial for the platform.\n\nWe propose that in light of these facts, the DAO will raise the percentage of repayment fees paid to eQI stakers from 30% to 50%. (In the same manner as before: buyback and distribute.)\n\n### Motivation\n \n- Make tokenomics of Qi more desirable\n- Increase payout to eQi stakers (long-term protocol believers)\n- Increase locked Qi amount\n- Decrease weekly Qi sold\n \n### Quorum Standards \n \n- The option with the most votes will be adopted. \n \n### Options \n\n- Approve proposal \n- Further discussions needed ",

You can distribute your voting power among as many and as few collateral types as you wish. The aggregate distribution of responses will be used to calculate the final distribution of rewards.\n\n### Quorum Standards:\n\nDue to bridging fees, a minimum allocation of 15,000 QI per week (8.33% of the vote) is needed for a chain to receive rewards. If the collateral types for a chain collectively do not achieve a 15,000 QI per week allocation, then their rewards will be proportionally split among the other collateral types.",

      "content": "### Context\n\nWe currently bribe veBAL holders with 2,000 QI / week for a pool on Arbitrum. That pool is currently $25,000 in TVL. At a pool APR of 4.5%, we have a negative ROI on this bribe.\n\nIf we were to incentivize a Curve pool directly through a masterchef, we would house a larger amount of liquidity. Assuming a 14% APR for the pool and QI at 25.8 cents, the new curve pool would have around $190,000 in liquidity (7.6x the size of the Balancer pool on Arbitrum).\n\n### Proposal\n\nSwitch the 2,000 QI / week bribe to a reward on Curve through our own masterchef. This implies the creation of a new Arbitrum pool on https://app.mai.finance/farm\n\n### Quorum Standards\n\nThe option with the most votes will be adopted.\n\n### Options\n\nAccept proposal\nReject proposal ",

As there is currently $75.51m of collateral locked in the  platform (as per DeFi Llama), we believe this is no longer acceptable and that steps should be taken to protect users in the unlikely event of a multisig compromise.\n\nOther lending platforms such as Aave and Compound do not allow for oracle changes without a timelock. See https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-move-control-of-price-oracle-to-governance-v2/3946/2 and https://compound.finance/docs/governance. Some platforms such as Liquity do not allow for changing the oracle at all.\n\n### Proposal\n\nVoting \"yes\" on this QIP directs the DAO to implement a small governance wrapper contract that will become the owner of the vaults. This wrapper contract should do the following:\n\n* Implement a timelock in order to change the oracle address\n* Implement a timelock in order to set the token peg\n* Remove access to the transferToken(address to, address token, uint256 amountToken) function\n* Allow for setting a new owner (for example, to upgrade the governance contract) but only with a timelock\n\nNew governance contract option (WIP): https://github.com/ajb/qidao-governance-contract/blob/main/src/QiVaultGovernance.sol\n\n### Quorum Standards\n\nThe option with the most votes will be adopted.\n\n### Options\n\n* Accept proposal\n* Reject proposal",

The rest of the voting power (roughly 50%) will be distributed based on this vote. \n\nA pool can be excluded from the initial vote draft if the volume is very low, if there is any malicious intent, or if incentivizing such LP is not aligned with the vision of the DAO, risk parameters and previously approved QIPs.\n\nVoting will be rounded to the nearest 1% given a minimum required vote allocation of 1%. If an option does not have enough votes for a 1% allocation, its allocation will be evenly distributed among other options.",

      "content": "Vault incentives are allocated a total of 180k Qi per week. Following QIP047, the distribution of these rewards among vault types will be decided every two weeks by the DAO.\n\nTo vote, you must hold Qi. You can distribute your voting power among as many and as few collateral types as you wish. The aggregate distribution of responses will be used to calculate the final distribution of rewards.\n\n### Quorum Standards\n\nDue to bridging fees, a minimum allocation of 15,000 QI per week (8.33% of the vote) is needed for a chain to receive rewards. If the collateral types for a chain collectively do not achieve a 15,000 QI per week allocation, then their rewards will be proportionally split among the other collateral types.\n\nNote: Qi holders will be able to vote from any chain that has QI.",

      "content": "Vault incentives are allocated a total of 180k Qi per week. Following QIP047, the distribution of these rewards among vault types will be decided every two weeks by the DAO.\n\nTo vote, you must hold Qi. You can distribute your voting power among as many and as few collateral types as you wish. The aggregate distribution of responses will be used to calculate the final distribution of rewards.\n\n### Quorum Standards:\n\nDue to bridging fees, a minimum allocation of 15,000 QI per week (8.33% of the vote) is needed for a chain to receive rewards. If the collateral types for a chain collectively do not achieve a 15,000 QI per week allocation, then their rewards will be proportionally split among the other collateral types.\n\nNote: Qi holders will be able to vote from Fantom and Polygon.",

You can distribute your voting power among as many and as few collateral types as you wish. The aggregate distribution of responses will be used to calculate the final distribution of rewards.\n\n### Quorum Standards:\n\nDue to bridging fees, a minimum allocation of 15,000 QI per week (8.33% of the vote) is needed for a chain to receive rewards. If the collateral types for a chain collectively do not achieve a 15,000 QI per week allocation, then their rewards will be proportionally split among the other collateral types.\n\nNote: Qi holders will be able to vote from Fantom and Polygon.",

You can distribute your voting power among as many and as few collateral types as you wish.

      "content": "### Proposal\n\nxxDai is an interest-bearing derivative of Maker’s Dai and is provided by Tetu. This proposal aims to add xxDai as a collateral option for minting MAI.\n\n### Risks and Benefits\n\nTetu’s xxDai strategy is an autompounding version of Tetu's xDai, which itself uses a vault feature the Tetu protocol calls Strategy Splitter. The Strategy Splitter, or Splitter for short, allows for the implementation of multiple strategies to generate yield on the underlying Dai across multiple platforms, reducing yield volatility and boosting returns. On Polygon, this strategy leverages Impermax and Aave, and developers have proposed adding Market.xyz, a protocol with which members of the QiDao community should be familiar as it is currently used to leverage borrowing of partner protocols’ tokens which do not currently have a Chainlink oracle and are therefore disqualified from being used as collateral to mint Mai. \n\nThe Tetu team has shown to be open to community suggestions on other potential destinations for the Splitter, including Aave v3.More information on Strategy Splitter can be found on Tetu’s Medium article on the subject.\n\nSee the xxDai Risk Assessment link located under Resources for a full list of risks and benefits.\n\n### Quorum Standards\n\nThe option with the most votes will be adopted. A weighted average will be used to decide on the minimum CDR (collateral to debt ratio) if the following conditions are met:\n• The options to add xxDai collectively outweigh the option to not add xxDai.\n• The option to not add xxDai receives more votes than any option to add xxDai.\n\n### Options\n\n• Add xxDai at 110% min CDR\n• Add xxDai at 120% min CDR\n• Add xxDai at 130% min CDR\n• Further discussion needed\n\n### Resources\n\n• xxDai Risk Assessment by @geekvine and @rob(ooor): https://cryptpad.fr/pad/#/3/pad/view/fcfbe14a268eff123778493e00a334cf/\n• xxDai Vault: https://app.tetu.io/vault/0xf52b3250e026e0307d7d717ae0f331baaa4f83a8\n\n• xxDai Contract: 0xf52B3250E026E0307d7d717AE0f331baAA4F83a8 ",

You can distribute your voting power among as many and as few collateral types as you wish. The aggregate distribution of responses will be used to calculate the final distribution of rewards.\n\n### Quorum Standards:\n\nDue to bridging fees, a minimum allocation of 15,000 QI per week (8.33% of the vote) is needed for a chain to receive rewards. If the collateral types for a chain collectively do not achieve a 15,000 QI per week allocation, then their rewards will be proportionally split among the other collateral types.\n\nNote: Qi holders will be able to vote from Fantom and Polygon.",

Vaults will allow users to mint MAI at a fixed interest rate against approved assets. This proposal seeks approval for xSTELLA.\n\n### Partnership details\n\nStellaSwap may add an origination and/or repayment fee on top of the fixed interest - if xSTELLA vaults are added to the StellaSwap UI. These fees will be retained entirely by StellaSwap.\n\nIn exchange for MAI support for xSTELLA, StellaSwap will introduce liquidity mining rewards for MAI LPs on their DEX. This will provide the necessary liquidity for StellaSwap vaults to succeed on Moonbeam.\n\nSTELLA: https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/stellaswap\nStellaSwap: https://stellaswap.com/\n\n### Vault specifications\n\n* Collateral assets to be used: xSTELLA\n* Max. LTV: 40%\n* Interest rate fee: 12% APR (Fixed)\n* Oracle provider: Witnet\n\n### Motivation\n\n* Enter Moonbeam ecosystem\n* Introduce MAI to new audiences\n* Increase revenue to QiDao\n* Increase TVL\n\n### Quorum Standards\n\nThe option with the most votes will be adopted.\n\n### Options\n\n* Approve proposal\n* Further discussions needed ",

      "content": "Every week, the DAO performs buybacks for Qi with a portion of weekly revenue. These buybacks involve retrieving tokens from either vaults or markets, and then selling those tokens for Qi on the open market. Sometimes, it is not favorable to perform these buybacks as the DAO would suffer a net loss of funds.\n\nThis proposal seeks to outline the circumstances from not performing buybacks for certain portions of weekly revenue. In these cases, the buybacks would be tracked and postponed for a later time (when doing so would be favorable).\n\n### Acceptable conditions:\n* Utilization rates on lending markets are too high to withdraw MAI\n* Bridging fees to chains where QI LPs are deployed are higher than the buyback amount\n* Gas fees are higher than the amount being bought back. This can sometimes be the case when withdrawing from yield aggregators for interest-bearing collaterals\n\n### Motivation\n\n* Reduce loss from buybacks\n* Increase operational efficiency of the DAO\n\n### Quorum Standards\n\nThe option with the most votes will be adopted.\n\n### Options\n\n* Accept proposal\n* Further discussions needed ",

These rewards will transition to bribes for Curve voters when a gauge for MAI is available on Optimism.\n\nDeploy $100,000-worth of capital on Uniswap V3 Optimism to set up protocol-owned liquidity for QI.\n\n### Reasoning\n\nCurve holds under $1M in liquidity on Optimism. 3k Qi / week in incentives should result in a MAI pool around $1M in liquidity, making it the largest pool for Curve on that chain.\n\nThe DAO should not allocate emissions for Qi liquidity on Optimism given how low the necessary amount is. With yearly emissions of Qi for the MAI pool at 156,000 QI, a pool of $100,000 should be sufficient for Qi trades.\n\nNote: WETH and WBTC vaults are ready on Optimism.\n\n### Motivation\n\n* Kickstart growth for MAI vaults on Optimism\n* Expose MAI to new audiences\n* Grow revenue\n* Grow TVL\n\n### Quorum Standards\n\nThe option with the most votes will be adopted.\n\n### Options\n\n* Accept proposal\n* Further discussions needed",

You can distribute your voting power among as many and as few collateral types as you wish. The aggregate distribution of responses will be used to calculate the final distribution of rewards.\n\n### Quorum Standards:\n\nDue to bridging fees, a minimum allocation of 15,000 QI per week (8.33% of the vote) is needed for a chain to receive rewards. If the collateral types for a chain collectively do not achieve a 15,000 QI per week allocation, then their rewards will be proportionally split among the other collateral types.\n\nNote: Qi holders will be able to vote from Fantom and Polygon.\n",

      "content": "Proposal from CelsiusX:\n\n### Summary\n\nRecently, Celsius launched CelsiusX to provide bridging infrastructure for a truly interoperable multichain future. The cxTokens have been adopted by QiDao, and now we are requesting the listing of Celsius’s native token, CEL.\n\nCEL is a top 100 market cap token with a $1bn+ market cap. CEL token has a fixed supply cap and a deflationary monetary policy. Celsius purchases CEL from the open market to pay rewards to its community, putting consistent buy-pressure on CEL. In addition, the CEL token has a weekly burning mechanism. Celsius is launching several initiatives to increase utility and adoption for CEL token, including a CelsiusX partnership with QiDao and other Polygon DeFi protocols to incubate liquidity. \n \nCelsiusX would love to partner with QiDao to adopt CEL tokens as collateral for MAI. We believe this will create utility and adoption for both parties - increasing the liquidity and collateral types for MAI (as the premier stablecoin on Polygon) and for CEL token by bringing it into DeFi and creating liquidity and use cases.\n\n### Proposal details\n\n- The Celsius community, over time, would deposit $3-5mm+ CEL token collateral into QiDao to mint MAI\n- The initial MAI minted will be used to provide stablecoin liquidity on AMMs as well as other MAI lending opportunities\n- This would create opportunities for the Celsius and CelsiusX community (1.5mm+ users on the Celsius platform) to use the native CEL token in DeFi on Polygon\n\n### Quorum Standards\n\nThe option with the most votes will be adopted. \n\nA weighted average will be used to decide on the minimum CDR if the following conditions are met:\n- The options to add CEL token collectively outweigh the option to not add CEL\n- The option to not add CEL tokens receives fewer votes than any option to add CEL \n \n### Options\n- Add CEL at 130% min CDR\n- Add CEL at 135% min CDR\n- Add CEL at 140% min CDR\n- Further discussion needed\n\n*min CDR = minimum collateral to debt ratio\n \n### Links to CEL Information:\n- 2018 ICO $50mm Raise: https://icodrops.com/celsius/\n- Rank #80 on Coingecko: https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/celsius-network-token\n- CEL weekly buy & burn: https://twitter.com/CelsiusNetwork/status/1504877945722134531?s=20&t=ln9hOcK_DnDapV_BKpT7Ow ",

You can distribute your voting power among as many and as few collateral types as you wish. The aggregate distribution of responses will be used to calculate the final distribution of rewards.\n\n### Quorum Standards:\n\nDue to bridging fees, a minimum allocation of 15,000 QI per week (8.33% of the vote) is needed for a chain to receive rewards. If the collateral types for a chain collectively do not achieve a 15,000 QI per week allocation, then their rewards will be proportionally split among the other collateral types.\n\nNote: Qi holders will be able to vote from Fantom and Polygon.",

As a result, all of the Qi in that contract (19,387,874.05 Qi) was stolen and sold in the market.\n\nCompensation from Superfluid\n\nThe affected wallets have not received any compensation from Superfluid. Any future compensation from Superfluid will go to the DAO\n\nInitial Allocations\n\n88% of Qi’s total supply was allocated to the community, with 12% allocated to early contributors and the core team. Our community allocation is significantly higher than those of other projects.\n\n### Proposal\n\nRestore the ~19M Qi taken from the protocol to reinstate allocation vesting. This will not affect the current emissions schedule for farms. All vesting would resume as detailed in the docs.\n\n### Motivation\n\nThe team is married to QiDao. We spend all day, every day working for the protocol. We don't take days off or work for other projects. QiDao is our number one focus. This level of commitment exists because we’re committed to our vision for the project and because we had a stake in the protocol. For the team to continue this level of commitment, the team should continue to have a stake in the project.\n\n### Quorum Standards\n\nThe option with the most votes will be adopted.\n\n### Options\n\n* Accept proposal\n* Further discussions needed",

You can distribute your voting power among as many and as few collateral types as you wish. The aggregate distribution of responses will be used to calculate the final distribution of rewards.\n\nQuorum Standards:\nDue to bridging fees, a minimum allocation of 15,000 QI per week (8.33% of the vote) is needed for a chain to receive rewards. If the collateral types for a chain collectively do not achieve a 15,000 QI per week allocation, then their rewards will be proportionally split among the other collateral types.\n\nNote: Qi holders will be able to vote from Fantom and Polygon.",

The underlying tokens are stablecoins, so the likelihood of significant price volatility is fairly low.\n\n### Motivation\n\n* Increase attractiveness of our vaults to new users\n* Strengthen relations with Stake DAO\n* Increase TVL\n\n### Quorum Standards\n\nThe option with the most votes will be adopted.\n\n### Options\n\n* Lower min CDR to 110%\n* Further discussions needed",

CelsiusX will be wrapping and bridging tokens to Polygon—both ERC20 tokens as well as non-ERC20 tokens. The purpose is to foster liquidity and adoption in the Polygon ecosystem by partnering with DeFi protocols. The initial wrapped tokens will be cxADA, cxDOGE, and cxETH (utilizing Chainlink Proof of Reserve—reserve info here: https://celsiusx.io/reserves).\n \nCelsiusX would love to partner with QiDao to use its cxTokens as collateral for MAI. We believe this will create utility and adoption for both parties—increasing the liquidity for MAI (as the premier stablecoin on Polygon) and for cxTokens (as a vehicle to bring retail and institutional users onto Polygon).\n\n### Proposal details:\n\n* Initial vault deposit: $20-25mm of cxETH by CelsiusX to mint MAI\n* The initial MAI minted will be used to provide MAI liquidity on AMMs\n\n### Quorum Standards\n\nThe option with the most votes will be adopted. \n\nA weighted average will be used to decide on the minimum CDR if the following conditions are met:\n* The options to add cxETH collectively outweigh the option to not add cxETH\n* The option to not add cxETH receives fewer votes than any option to add cxETH\n \n### Options\n* Add cxETH at 130% min CDR\n* Add cxETH at 135% min CDR\n* Add cxETH at 140% min CDR\n* Further discussion needed\n\n*min CDR = minimum collateral to debt ratio",

Given our current market cap ($40M) and liquid market cap ($20M), the QI-MATIC LP is larger than necessary for providing low slippage trades.\n\nQi liquidity currently receives more incentives than MAI liquidity on Polygon. As the protocol continues to own more of QI's liquidity on the market, the DAO can continue to lower emissions for QI liquidity.\n\nThe protocol currently owns $3.6M of QI-MATIC and $340k of QI-DAI.\n\n### Proposal details\n\n* Lower QI-MATIC emissions by 25%\n* End QI-BAL emissions (currently 15k QI / week)\n* Move part of QI-BAL emissions to MAI liquidity on Balancer (increase from 15k QI / week to 20k QI / week)\n\n### Quorum Standards\n\nThe option with the most votes will be adopted.\n\n### Options\n\n* Approve emissions update\n* Further discussions needed ",

Following QIP047, the distribution of these rewards among vault types will be decided every two weeks by the DAO. Gauge votes will take place 5-7 days before the rewards change to allow users to move to the most profitable vaults.\n\nTo vote, distribute your voting power among collateral types. You can vote for as many and as few collateral types as you wish. The aggregate distribution of responses will be used to calculate the final distribution of rewards.\n\nNote: Qi holders can now vote with Qi on both Polygon and Fantom.\n\n### Quorum Standards:\n\nDue to bridging fees, a minimum allocation of 15,000 QI per week (8.33% of the vote) is needed for a chain to receive rewards. If the collateral types for a chain collectively do not achieve a 15,000 QI per week allocation, then their rewards will be proportionally split among the other collateral types.",

All partners must first be whitelisted through a governance vote before acquiring KPI Options.\n\nQiDao has set aside 4.8M Qi for this purpose. The target tenor of this program is 18 months, after which the KPI options will be redeemable for Qi tokens. These KPI Options tokens will have a minimum value of 1 Qi each — but if the KPI increases, they will pay out Qi in proportion to the KPI target being met (up to 2 Qi).\n\nPartners can choose to rollover their options for another 18 months after expiry to achieve a higher KPI metric and payout.\n\nThe price of each KPI option is the 14-day TWAP for Qi at the time of whitelisting approval.\n\n### Motivation\n\nJulien is a prolific builder and a thought leader in the crypto space. He’s involved in Curve Finance, founder of Stake DAO, Blackpool, and Rekt. Aligning incentives with him would be beneficial to the DAO in the following ways:\n\n- Helping with implementing our Curve rewards strategy, through lobbying as well as planning\n- Increasing synergies between his projects and QiDao starting with Stake DAO (i.e. building more use cases for MAI, introducing QiDao to new communities)\n- Onboarding him as a community member to help brainstorm strategic decisions, and leverage his network in the DeFi space\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/bneiluj\n\n### Quorum Standards\n\nSingle choice voting: the option with the most votes will be adopted.\n\n### Options\n\n* Whitelist Julien Bouteloup\n* Further discussions needed",

As Stake DAO and QiDao deploy on other chains, future Stake DAO strategies will also have access to leverage at QiDao\n\n* QiDao does not charge interest for stablecoin loans, increasing yield opportunities for sdTokens\n\n* Stake DAO holds CRV, which can be used to vote for Curve incentives for MAI. This in turn allows for high debt ceilings for sdToken MAI vaults\n\n* Both projects have deployed on multiple chains\n\n* QiDao’s partnership with Market.xyz would allow Stake DAO assets without chainlink oracles access to low-interest stablecoin loans\n\n### Stake DAO\n\nStake DAO’s mission is to build open products which make the most sophisticated DeFi strategies easily accessible to anyone. It offers a wide range of products such as DeFi strategy vaults, a DEX aggregator, an NFT marketplace, PoS staking, LP Farming, and a crypto academy.\n\nAt the time of writing, Stake DAO holds $745M in TVL. It has a $35M market cap, with a $158M fully diluted valuation. 37% of circulating SDT tokens are currently staked to earn protocol revenue distributions.\n\nStake DAO strategies deployed on Ethereum, Polygon, Avalanche, and BSC.\n\nWebsite link: https://stakedao.org/ \n\n### QiDao\n\nQiDao is a collateral-backed stablecoin protocol. It allows users to mint MAI against the value of their assets at 0% interest. There are 30 different collaterals approved to back MAI, including CRV, yvDAI, and compounding Aave market MATIC.\n\nAt the time of writing, QiDao holds $113M in TVL. It has a $20M market cap, with a $117M fully diluted valuation. 42% of circulating Qi tokens are currently staked to earn protocol revenue distributions.\n\nMAI lending is available on Polygon, Fantom, Avalanche, Moonriver, and Harmony.\n\nWebsite link: https://www.mai.finance/\n\n### Quorum Standards\n\nSingle choice voting: the option with the most votes will be adopted.\n\n### Options\n\n* Approve token swap\n* Further discussions needed \n",

      "content": "Adding safety measures has been a top priority for QiDao. We are excited to share a proposal from Tidal Finance to add insurance coverage for the project as well as our end users.\n\nTidal is a Polygon-native insurance protocol that helps other projects protect against smart contract exploitations. Tidal will help us to bootstrap USDC as insurance collateral on its platform. USDC depositors will earn the premium fees from our payment, as well as TIDAL tokens.\n\nSince Tidal is also a Polygon ecosystem assigned insurance provider, the Polygon ecosystem fund is willing to contribute additional MATIC tokens (10k USD value) to incentivize a high quality native projects’ reserve pool. Mai.Finance would be able to receive this extra benefit.\n\nOnce our insurance reserve pool is launched, we can subscribe to the coverage plan by setting up the desired coverage amount. No upfront costs or long term contracts required, and the coverage plan is automatically extended on a weekly basis, as long as there is enough balance in the payment account.\n\nPayment can be made in USDC or QI, on Polygon, offering a useful utility for QI token holders. \n\n### Partnership details\n\nTidal will incentivize Mai Finance’s reserve pool by allocating 475,000 TIDAL weekly (~ 4,500 USD value at current price). The allocation could gradually go down as more projects get onboarded, but the average weekly incentive would be 300,000 TIDAL for at least 6 months.

      "content": "This proposal is to decide if we should use 100% of our profits from the Green Leverage Locker to purchase BCT.\n\nLink to market: https://polygon.market.xyz/pool/5\n\nAs of QIP039, QiDao is seeding the Green Leverage Locker (GLL) with an initial 1M MAI in order to offer a low-cost way to borrow MAI against ReFi (Regenerative Finance) assets such as  BCT or sKlima. \n\nTo position QiDao at the center of the green movement in ReFi on Polygon, actions must speak louder than words. \n\nBCT has quickly become one of the essential assets in the current ReFi space. It's value increased steadily since it's introduction and legacy carbon markets are already accepting BCTs price signal for offline OTC trading of carbon offsets.\n\nAs the green committee's first initiative, we propose that 100% of weekly profits will be used to purchase BCTs. We will use the BCT to build a green treasury to further leverage upcoming green initiatives. \n\nTo demonstrate our commitment to climate action, we propose to properly burn portions of the BCT once Toucan's burn function is in place.\n\nThe DAO can vote on the amount of BCT to be burned. The Green Committee advocates a 50% burn rate. Assuming a 20% APY on the GLL, a BCT price of $7.7, and a time frame of 3 months, this gives a total of about 3000 tons of carbon offset and another 3000 BCT to use for future incentives. \n\nShowing that monetary profits are not the sole goal of QiDao will help put us at the center of ReFi and manifest MAI as the defacto green stable coin. \n\nThe reach of this first step will also help us improve our reputation in the fast growing green communities such as Klima & Toucan protocol, bringing positive network for future vaults.\n\n### Motivation\n* Position QiDao in the center of the upcoming ReFi movement \n* Manifest MAI as the defacto green stable-coin\n* Build reputation as a DAO taking action on climate change \n\n### Quorum Standards\n\nThe option with the most votes will be adopted.\n\n### Options\n* Use GLLP to buy BCT and burn 50%: half of the BCT bought will be burned and the other half will be retained in the DAO\n* Use GLLP to buy BCT and not burn: all BCT bought will be retained in the DAO\n* Do not buy BCT\n\nGLLP = Green Leverage Locker profit\n",

If you want to increase your voting power you can go to app.mai.finance/boost. Revenue share from the vaults repayment fees will be distributed to Qi stakers based on their amount of eQi.\n\n### Partnership details\n\nBeefy is one of the largest yield aggregators, with over $1B in deposits.

We propose introducing 200,000 of that MAI to the LP market.\n\nThe LP market currently allows users to deposit three LP tokens (USDC/DAI/USDT, MATIC/USDC, and renBTC/WBTC) as collateral to borrow MAI from other users. This allows yield farmers to lever their LP yield using MAI. \n\nIntroducing MAI from the protocol’s liquidity will lower the cost of borrowing MAI, kickstarting the usage of that market. It will also allow the protocol to earn interest by lending MAI. This revenue will be accrued by the DAO.\n\nLink to LP market: [https://polygon.market.xyz/pool/3](https://polygon.market.xyz/pool/3)\n\n### What is Market.xyz?\n\nMarket.xyz is a platform that allows communities to launch isolated lending markets.

      "content": "This proposal is to decide on whether to structure strategic partnerships with KPI options.\n\nEngaging in strategic partnerships allows the protocol to tap external resources through aligning incentives. If this standard is approved, prospective partners will need to approach the DAO with proposals to be whitelisted.\n\n### Standard for Strategic Partnerships with QiDao\n\nQiDao will exchange KPI options with whitelisted partners once approved by the community. The payout from these options depends on the total amount of MAI borrowed from vaults, thereby giving every recipient an incentive to grow the protocol (KPI = key performance indicator).\n\nQiDao has set aside 4.8M Qi for this purpose under the tokenomics framework. The target tenor of this program is 18 months, after which the KPI options will be redeemable for Qi tokens. These KPI Options tokens will have a minimum value of 1 Qi each — but if the KPI increases, they will pay out Qi in proportion to the KPI target being met (up to 2 Qi).\n\nMAI borrowed from vaults : Qi payout per option\n* <30,000,000 : 1.00 QI\n* 1,000,000,000 : 1.13 QI\n* 2,000,000,000 : 1.27 QI\n* 3,000,000,000 : 1.40 QI\n* 4,000,000,000 : 1.53 QI\n* 7,500,000,000 : 2.00 QI\n\nThe price of each option will be at a 5% discount of Qi’s price.\n\nPartners can choose to rollover their options for another 18 months after expiry to achieve a higher KPI metric and payout. If a higher KPI metric is reached at the new expiry date, then a higher amount of Qi will be dispersed.\n\n### Quorum Standards\n\nThe option with the most votes will be adopted.\n\n### Options\n\n* Approve standard\n* Do not approve standard ",

Beethoven X has provided liquidity mining rewards for a MAI-USDC pool during this time, accumulating 3,627,185 MAI. Beethoven gives around $23,000 per week in rewards to this pool. Similar to the partnership we have with Balancer on Polygon, we look to make strong ties with Beethoven X as we expand on Fantom.\n\nThe proposed MAI pool would be MAI-USDC, and would receive 15,000 QI per week. This is the same amount we award Balancer’s stable pool on Polygon. The proposed QI pool would be QI-FTM, and would receive 10,000 QI per week.\n\nThe rewards would last 2 months, by which time the DAO will begin receiving FTM rewards from TVL (assuming QiDao maintains at least $5M TVL on Fantom).\n\nA 0.5% deposit fee will be charged for staking LPs on Mai Finance.\n\n### Motivation\n\n* Bolster MAI’s peg given high demand for levering collaterals on Fantom\n* Provide more MAI liquidity for users levering on MAI vaults\n\n### Quorum Standards\n\nThe option with the most votes will be adopted\n\n### Options\n\n* Incentivize the pool\n* Do not incentivize the pool ",

Polygon has provided a great place to build a product that we believe can benefit users across the DeFi space. QiDao has grown from collaborations with all major projects on Polygon, and recently with projects outside of Polygon. QiDao has expanded MAI’s liquidity to Solana (11M MAI), Avalanche (4.6M MAI) and Moonriver (1.9M MAI). \n\nGiven our success on Polygon and with our cross-chain partnerships, we believe that it’s time to take the next step towards expansion. Prioritizing security, we’re prepared to take MAI lending to other chains.\n\n### Summary\n\n* MAI vaults will be available on other chains to borrow MAI against collateral tokens at 0% interest\n* The same debt ceiling structure will be maintained, where debt ceilings are increased in response to borrowing demand\n* All currently accepted collaterals will also be accepted on other chains. New collateral tokens will be approved through improvement proposals\n* Qi rewards may be extended to other chains, if the community votes separately to do so\n* Official bridges will be used where available. Otherwise, the protocol will choose safe bridges based on audit reports, code review, usage, as well as other risk-management factors\n* Revenue from other chains will be returned to Polygon for distribution to Qi stakers\n\n### Quorum Standards\n\nThe option with the most votes will be adopted.\n\n### Options\n\n* Approve QiDao's expansion\n* Do not approve QiDao's expansion",

In order to provide a competitive short-term option for borrowing MAI, QiDao would have to create a lending market for MAI with a floating interest rate. This would allow for a low cost option for loans under 2 months. Instead of launching a lending platform to create these markets, QiDao would like to partner with Market.xyz.\n\nLink to stablecoin market: [https://polygon.market.xyz/pool/1](https://polygon.market.xyz/pool/1)\n\nLink to Market.xyz: [https://polygon.market.xyz/](https://polygon.market.xyz/)\n\n### What is Market.xyz?\n\nMarket.xyz is a platform that allows communities to launch isolated lending markets. These markets are controlled by an admin. In the case of this stablecoin market, it would be QiDao. Market.xyz was created from Rari Capital's code and was invested by the the founder of Rari Capital, Jai Bhavnani.\n\n### Seed Amount:\n\nThe initial protocol market operation would inject 1 million MAI into the lending market. The act of borrowing MAI from this market would mint MAI with accepted collateral. The protocol would continually adjust the amount of MAI provided to the market in response to supply and demand.\n\nAll interest fees earned from the protocol providing MAI will be returned to the DAO.\n\n### Motivation:\n\n* Allow for a short-term borrowing option for MAI using fluctuating interest rates as opposed to a fixed repayment fee\n* Increase the amount of MAI in circulation\n* Introduce a new yield opportunity for long-term MAI borrowers\n* QiDao would not have to build or maintain a new protocol to start a lending market\n\n### Quorum Standards:\n\nThe option with the most votes will be chosen.\n\n### Options:\n\n* Partner with Market.xyz\n* Do not partner with Market.xyz\n* Further discussions needed\n",

By adding more assets, we attract a wider range of users who seek to gain stable value from their tokens at 0% interest. Vaults allow the users to gain the benefit of a stablecoin without spending the underlying asset.\n\nAdding a collateral type will also include their Aave market token, if they have one. For example, voting to add wBTC will also be a vote for camwBTC.\n\nIf approved, users will be able to mint MAI by locking these tokens in vaults and borrowing on their value at 0% interest. Doing so will allow users to benefit from the value of their tokens without spending them.\n\nThe minimum collateral to debt ratio for these collateral types will be 130% if accepted.\n\nYour voting power is represented in Qi Powah. If you want to increase your voting power you can go to app.mai.finance/boost. Revenue share from the vaults repayment fees will be distributed to Qi stakers based on their amount of eQi.\n\n### Token information:\n\ndQUICK\n* Holders on Polygon: 15,442\n* Fully diluted market cap: $84M\n\nGHST\n* Holders on Polygon: 14,988\n* Fully diluted market cap: $57M\n\nBAL\n* Holders on Polygon: 9,579\n* Fully diluted market cap: $48M\n\nDPI\n* Holders on Polygon: 322\n* Fully diluted market cap: Unavailable\n\nUNI\n* Holders on Polygon: 6,785\n* Fully diluted market cap: $11M\n\n### Other Considerations:\n\n* dQUICK: QuickSwap recently doubled their LP incentives for MAI and QI. dQUICK also grows in value over time by collecting QuickSwap rewards.\n\n* GHST: Aavegotchi will likely be incentivizing borrowing against GHST with Frens tokens. They will also introduce Lao Zi wearables for Aavegotchis\n\n* BAL: Balancer is currently incentivizing pools with QI and MAI with 5,000 BAL per week\n\n* DPI: Index Coop is likely to incentivize borrowing against DPI\n\n### Motivation:\n\n* Increase user options\n* Attract new audience\n* Reduce protocol risk\n* Increase protocol revenue\n* Increase TVL\n\n### Quorum Standards:\n\nThis will be an approval vote, meaning that users will be able to vote for any number of options. Options with more than 50% of the vote will be added as collateral, with a maximum of 3 options to be chosen. \n\n### Options:\n\n* dQUICK\n* GHST\n* BAL\n* DPI\n* UNI\n* Do not add new collaterals\n\n### Acknowledgements\n\nH/T to Davidpgil and Backfire Capital for their input in drafting this proposal.",

      "content": "AscendEX has prepared the following proposal for the QiDao community to list both QI and MAI on their centralized exchange. If approved, this would be the first listing for QiDao’s tokens on a centralized exchange.\n\n### Background on AscendEX:\n\n* 24h volume at time of writing: $187,371,449\n* Weekly visits: 236,890\n* CoinGecko link: https://www.coingecko.com/en/exchanges/ascendex\n* Withdraws to Polygon? Yes\n\nBelow is the unedited proposal that AscendEX wrote:\n\n### What is included?\n\n### Infrastructure Integration:\n\n* Staking support through the AscendEX website; Easy to use - One-click staking\n* Yield Farming support through the AscendEX website; Easy to use - One-click to provide liquidity\n\nAllows users who prefer a centralized exchange to interact with the project's underlying fundamentals. Provides QiDao community access to an additional 1 million + users to buy, sell, and interact with $QI and $MAI.\n\n### Full Marketing Support:\n\n* Content creation and distribution to news outlets around the world\n* Grassroot community mobilization through influencers and other avenues across English, Chinese, Korean, Japanese, Turkish, French, and more.\n\n### Supporting $QI and $MAI Overall Global Liquidity Strategy:\n\nWhiteglove advisory support related to QiDao’s global liquidity strategy.

We’re forwarding this proposal to the community to vote on whether to approve this partnership.\n\nAs part of the deal, QiDao would provide $1.4 million in Qi to seed the index. QiDao would then receive an equal amount in the index token, which would be backed by funds from the other projects involved. \n\nThe Amun team has already partnered with Polygon, who will make up 50% of the index with MATIC. The other projects that will be included are QuickSwap, Aavegotchi, Adamant, and DFYN. QiDao’s allocation is currently 6.8% of the index, ahead of ADDY and DFYN (and behind QUICK, GHST, and MATIC).\n\n### Motivation\n\nThe token will be available on both Polygon and Ethereum, allowing Ethereum-native investors to access QI without bridging funds to Polygon. \n\nAmun will commit to marketing the token through giveaways, listings, and social media content.\n\n### Additional resources:\n\nAmun website: https://amun.com/\nAmun Discord channel: https://discord.gg/N9nQh65mTq\n\n### Quorum standards:\n\nOptions must receive more than 50% of the vote to pass.\n\n### Options:\n\nYes: partner with Amun\nNo: do not partner with Amun\n",

      "content": "**Please read the entire proposal before voting, as there are several factors to consider.**\n\n### Summary:\n\nOur current liquidity mining incentives on QuickSwap are scheduled to end on September 2nd. **This proposal is for the community to decide whether or not we will extend liquidity mining incentives and if so on what AMM.** The amount of rewards and what LPs to reward will be decided on a different proposal. \n\nThe liquidity mining rewards QiDao currently has on QuickSwap started on May 5th and were scheduled to last 120 days. Below is an overview of the current rewards:\n\nQi rewards:\n* MAI-USDC LP receives 1 Qi per block\n* QI-MAI LP receives 2 Qi per block\n\nQUICK rewards:\n* QI-QUICK LP receives 1 QUICK per day\n* MAI-USDC LP receives 10 QUICK per day\n\nThese LPs currently have $110 million in TVL and $2.7 million of 24 hr trading volume.\n\nThe community can vote to extend, stop, or migrate those rewards to another AMM. Please note that a follow up proposal will be submitted to discuss the amount of incentives QiDao would distribute and what LPs would be rewarded. The rewards period, if approved, will last 90 days. \n\nBelow are the offers QiDao has received from some of the top 5 AMMs on Polygon. The following offers are based on a scenario in which QiDao reduces their current rewards emission by half. If the community decides to reduce the current emissions by more than half, the committed rewards from the AMMs may vary. Note that our Balancer rewards will be covered in a separate proposal.\n\n### QuickSwap: \n\nRewards committed (QuickSwap is doubling their current incentives for our pairs): \n* Stablecoin pool(s): 20 QUICK per day ($12.5k value per day). QuickSwap will have a 2x boost period for rewards for an initial period.\n* QI Pair LP: 10 QUICK per day ($6.25k value per day). QuickSwap will have a 2x boost period for rewards for an initial period.\n* Some rewards (unspecified) will be given to MAI-QUICK LP\n\nRouting: \n* MAI has been added to QuickSwap routing. The update should be effective in early September. Adding MAI to routing would promote its volume and reduce price impact on MAI transactions.\n\nAMM Metrics:\n* TVL: $1.03 billion; Volume: $104 million\n\nToken Information:\n* [QUICK](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/quickswap)\n\n### SushiSwap\n\nEstimated rewards (not committed - these are estimates based on volume. SushiSwap does not commit to rewards. They reward LPs based on usage):\n* Stablecoin pool(s): 432 SUSHI per day ($5.4k value per day)\n* QI Pair LP: 173 SUSHI per day ($2.2k value per day)\n\nRouting:\n* MAI is not used for routing on Sushi. This would negatively impact the volume and price impact of MAI transactions.\n\nAMM Metrics:\n* TVL: $617 million; Volume: $34 million\n\nToken Information: \n* [SUSHI](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/sushi)\n\n### DFYN\n\nRewards committed: \n* Stablecoin pool(s): 24,750 Dfyn per day ($30k value per day)\n* QI Pair LP: 8,250 Dfyn per day ($10k value per day)\n\nRouting: \n* MAI will be added as a default routing asset. Adding MAI to routing would promote its volume and reduce price impact on MAI transactions.\n\nAMM Metrics:\n* TVL: $226.5 million; Volume: $10 million\n\nToken Information:\n* [DFYN](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/dfyn-network)\n\n### Quorum standards\n\nIf one AMM receives more than ⅔ of the vote, it will get all Qi LP rewards. If no AMM receives more than ⅔ of the vote, then Qi rewards will be split according to their share of the vote. The minimum amount of votes to receive Qi rewards will be ⅓ of votes.\n\n### Options: \n\n* QuickSwap\n* DFYN\n* SushiSwap\n* No AMM / remove incentives",

Currently, Anchor only allows users to mint MAI with USDC. Minting through Anchor currently incurs a 1% fee.\n\nAnchor is a protocol mechanism that helps MAI maintain its peg. Anchor ensures that there is always MAI-USDC liquidity at a price that is close to the peg. This allows users to be able to repay their loans at close to $1 even if the price of MAI deviates from the peg on the open market. If you would like to read more about the inner workings of the USDC Swap (Anchor) please read : https://docs.mai.finance/stablecoin-economics#usdc-swap \n\nIf the proposed stablecoins are added to Anchor, users would be able mint MAI with USDT and DAI for a 1% fee. \n\nUSDT and DAI are the largest stablecoins in terms of liquidity, along with USDC. They are both in Curve’s base stablecoin pool, which speaks to their stability. USDT and DAI are also listed on Aave.\n\n### Liquidity on Polygon:\n\nUSDT liquidity:\n* Aave: $175,873,203\n* Curve: $108,915,747\n* QuickSwap: $84,656,942\n* Sushi: $45,405,840\n* DFYN: $51,096,385\n* Balancer: $8,460,795\n* Others: $79,623,505\n\nDAI liquidity:\n* Aave: $898,671,441\n* Curve: $78,075,279\n* QuickSwap: $31,197,240\n* Sushi: $30,607,884\n* DFYN: $21,530,421\n* Balancer: $8,053,944\n* Others: $71,130,608\n\n### Motivation:\n* Add options for QiDao users to mint MAI with their stablecoins at a fixed rate\n* Reduce the percent of MAI backed by one collateral type\n\n### Options:\n* Option 1: Add USDT to Anchor \n* Option 2: Add DAI to Anchor\n* Option 3: Add both DAI and USDT to Anchor\n* Option 4: Do not add USDT or DAI to Anchor\n",

      "content": "### Summary:\n\nHow might we better reward current Qi stakers and increase the demand for Qi?\n\nThe protocol's largest revenue stream comes from USDC Swap fees. When users use the Swap they pay a 1% fee.\n\nThis is a proposal to distribute 30% of weekly USDC Swap fees to Qi stakers. Since the USDC swap was implemented (week 5) it has generated an average of $180,000 per week in revenues for the protocol.\n\n### Current Qi staking rewards\nQi stakers currently receive:\n* 30% of weekly repayment fee revenue (plus a 25% boost) \n* 100% of LP rewards received from using deposit fee revenue to farm QI-MAI on QuickSwap.\n\n### What is the USDC Swap?\nThe Swap allows users to swap USDC for MAI and MAI for USDC. The price to buy MAI sets a price ceiling of $1.01 and the price to sell MAI sets a price floor of $0.99. The price of MAI should trend close to $1, given that MAI can only repay $1 worth of debt. The ceiling and floor on its price keeps it from diverging from its peg too much.\nIf you would like to read more about the inner workings of the USDC Swap please read : [https://docs.mai.finance/stablecoin-economics#usdc-swap](https://docs.mai.finance/stablecoin-economics#usdc-swap)\n\n### Motivation:\n* Return more value to our loyal supporters\n* Encourage more Qi holders to lock Qi\n* Increase demand for Qi\n\n### Options\nOption 1: Distribute 30% of weekly USDC Swap fees to Qi stakers\nOption 2: Do not distribute 30% of weekly USDC Swap fees to Qi stakers\n",

      "title": "QIP 017: Increasing Capital Efficiency",
      "content": "### Summary\n\nThrough discussions on Discord and Telegram, we’ve seen desires to give users a higher Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratio. Increasing the LTV ratio for vaults would allow users to increase the amount of MAI they could borrow against their collateral, improving their capital efficiency. QiDao could achieve this by lowering liquidation ratios.\n\n### Example\nA user has $900 worth of tokens sitting in a QiDao vault\n\nWith a liquidation ratio of 150% the user would be allowed to borrow a maximum of $600 worth of MAI against their collateral\nWith a liquidation ratio of 120% the user would be allowed to borrow a maximum of $750 worth of MAI against their collateral\n\nWith the lower liquidation ratio the user can access more of the value of their tokens locked in a vault. \n\n### Current liquidation ratios per collateral\n* MATIC - 150%\n* WETH - 150%\n* LINK - 150%\n* AAVE - 150%\n* CRV - 150%\n* camwMATIC - 155%\n* camWETH - 155%\n* camAAVE - 155%\n\n### QiDao current liquidation process:\nWhen vaults fall below the liquidation ratio, liquidators repay 50% of the vault’s debt and withdraw a portion of the locked collateral tokens as compensation so that the liquidator gets a ~10% gain. The vault is then returned to the original vault owner at a healthy collateral to debt ratio. More info can be found at https://docs.mai.finance/liquidation\n\n### Risk\nBlack swan events occur when prices of assets fall at very rapid rates. Lowering the liquidation ratio could decrease the collateral cushion that keeps MAI overcollateralized. We note that QiDao has experienced one historic black swan event in May as well as several market downturns throughout the past few weeks. During those events, liquidations functioned smoothly, and no vaults fell near 100%.\n\n### How would we combat the risks?\nBelow are some mitigants to the risk of lower liquidation ratios to 120% that could be implemented.\n\n* Ensure liquidator rewards are still worth it to encourage quick liquidations. Liquidations have been very effective so far. We have now been through multiple black swan events and liquidations worked extremely well through those events\n\n* Implement a stability pool to manage liquidation (subject to community discussion). This stability pool would be protocol run to ensure that vaults would be liquidated quickly when falling below the determined liquidation ratio. This would ensure that any risky vaults are liquidated quickly \n\n* Use protocol treasury as an insurance policy in the case of MAI becoming undercollateralized \n\n### Competitive analysis on Polygon\n\nPolyquity - Liquidation ratio 110%\n\n![Polyquity average C/D](https://ibb.co/kmqwt8Z)\n \nAave - Risk Parameters - Risk \n\n100% / LTV = Collateral to Debt\n\n![Aave LTV chart](https://ibb.co/8jq8gy4)\n\n### Motivation\n* Increase protocol’s capital efficiency without materially raising protocol risk\n* Maintaining the competitiveness of the protocol\n* Attract new users to borrow MAI through vaults\n\nOption #1 \nLower minimum liquidation ratio to 120% for non-stablecoin collaterals\n\nOption #2:\nMaintain minimum 150% liquidation ratio for non-stablecoin collaterals (no change)\n",

      "content": "### Summary:\n\nWe were approached by an auditing firm called [Cloackwire](https://cloakwire.com/) to perform a comprehensive audit on QiDao. Given that this is a community-run project, we’re forwarding this proposal for the community to vote on.\n\nSecurity and protocol safety is of utmost importance to us and our users. Before releasing any new protocol feature we conduct thorough internal checks and testing. Our intention from the start was to conduct more external audits as we continue to build the protocol to ensure that QiDao is as safe as possible for its users.\n\n### Previous work done by Cloakwire:\n\nCloakwire has specialized in finance, critical infrastructure, transport, and crypto. The Cloakwire team has worked with companies such as Allegiant Airlines, Laclede, Carnival Cruise, Columbia Bank, Lufthansa, Altera, B&M Gates foundation, and some Berkshire companies. In specific to crypto and defi, their team has also worked with projects like Saber, Nitro Finance, Lido, and Skale. \n\n### Information about the Cloakwire team: \n\nThe members of their team that will review the smart contracts have done work for Quant Stamp and Hacken.\n\n[Company brochure](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1nsj7nMI9MsOXgm_kuKJsR3GE9hl_YQWL/view)\n\nThe full audit would cost 36,000 Qi to complete and would cover the following scope of work:  \n\n### Best Practices Review\nCloakwire will review all existing security procedures, policies, and best practices established by QiDao with the objective of further enhancing governance by making improvements, additions, or adjustments where needed. \n\n### Smart Contract Security Audit\nExhaustive testing methodologies will be applied to two (2) multi-collateral smart contracts to determine what security vulnerabilities may exist that could be exploited by attackers, resulting in a loss of funds. \n\n### Advanced Network Vulnerability Assessment (Internal and External)\nCloakwire will perform a series of scans employing the use of various custom or commercial tools to discover all systems and services in use by QiDao. The focus of this assessment will be to discover as many vulnerabilities as possible on all internal and external systems. Cloakwire will then validate all findings to ensure there are no false-positives, and finally offer suggestions for remediation or improvement. \n\n### Scenario-Based Penetration Test\nCloakwire will perform a series of attacks against the target infrastructure in order to determine the effectiveness of Client security controls and alerting. These attacks will be from the perspective of an attacker attempting to fabricate situations through which they can obtain investor or user funds, or otherwise disrupt the usability of the systems and applications leveraged by investors or users.\n\n### Motivation\n* Ensure best security practices\n* Identify any vulnerabilities that could be exploited\n* Reduce protocol risk\n\n### Options:\nFor: Perform the security with Cloakwire for 36,000 Qi\nAgainst: Do not conduct the audit with Cloakwire for 36,000 Qi\n\nYour voting power is represented in Qi Powah.

      "title": "QIP 014: Incentivize collateral vaults to borrow MAI",
      "content": "### Summary:\n\nHow might we incentivize borrowing MAI through vaults and attract new users?\n\nCurrently around 90% of the MAI in circulation was minted through the USDC swap. We want to increase the amount of MAI in circulation minted through vaults. Having more collateral in our vaults will help grow our TVL as well as increase the protocol repayment fees (30% of which are distributed to Qi stakers).\n\nWe also want to attract new users to try our vaults and become part of the QiDao community. With attractive borrowing offers we should be able to increase the number of users, TVL, MAI in circulation, and protocol revenue. \n\n### Incentive Proposal\n\n* Minting MAI through collateral vaults would be incentivized for vaults whose collateral to debt ratio is between 25% and 270% above the liquidation ratio.\n* The rewards would last as long as they are net profitable to the protocol.\n\n### How it would work:\n\nUsers will be eligible for rewards for opening vaults and borrowing MAI through a boosted vault type. These rewards will come in the form of Qi. These incentives will transform QiDao vaults from being 0% loans to negative interest loans (getting paid to take loans) during the boost period. Users would get rewarded based on the amount of the MAI they borrow through a specific collateral type. For example, if a user minted 10% of the MAI attributed to WETH collateral, they would receive 10% of the Qi / block rewards for that vault type.\n\n### Additional info & Resources:\n\nCurrent collateral types accepted on QiDao are MATIC, wETH, AAVE, LINK, and CRV (as well as their amTokens if they have one). We will have weekly QIPs for our community to vote on collaterals they would like to see added.\n\nPartner projects could incentivize their community to lock up their tokens in QiDao vaults by adding additional rewards. Project boosts will be separate from the Qi rewards. The projects will determine the amount and length of their boost. Their boost would likely be paid in their token.\n\nQi emissions currently sit around 3.34/block. Assuming 1 to 2 debt ceiling increases per week, the protocol would accrue more repayment fee revenue than it would spend in Qi incentives at 0.05 Qi / block (at $1.07 Qi price) for each vault type.\n\nVault incentives would be claimed each week on Wednesday for the previous week. Users will be able to claim incentives by going to the rewards page and clicking claim on the vault incentives line item.\n\n### Motivation\n\n* Promote locking collateral to borrow MAI\n* Attract new users\n* Increase QiDao TVL\n* Introduce negative interest rates (earning yield for borrowing) to vault owners\n\nOption 1: Incentivize minting MAI through vaults with 0.1 Qi/block\nOption 2: Incentivize minting MAI through vaults with 0.05 Qi/block\nOption 3: Do not incentivize borrowing MAI through vaults\n",

      "content": "## Summary:\n**How can we use the idle LP Tokens earned as protocol revenue to better incentivize Qi stakers, reduce Qi emissions, and improve the health of the protocol.**\n\nAs of week 11 the protocol has earned around $1,836,864 value in QuickSwap LP tokens (MAI-QI and MAI-USDC) through the farm deposit fees (0.5%). These LP tokens are owned by Qi holders and are currently sitting in the treasury. \n\nTreasuries current QuickSwap LP token holdings:\n![Treasuries current QuickSwap LP token holdings](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmZtvzw9YkM1D6w7h5HEXVYffAR3oaVwCkGR67oUG6DT5q)\n\nTreasury multisig: 0x3feacf904b152b1880bde8bf04ac9eb636fee4d8\n\n### What could we do with the holdings?\n\nWe have the opportunity to utilize those LP tokens to farm Qi in the [mai.finance)[https://mai.finance) pools and redistribute those rewards back to Qi stakers. Deposit fee revenue is averaging just under $175,000 per week. As we earn more deposit fees we would continue to redeposit those into the pools to maximize returns.\n\n### Current farm statistics\n\nOur current farming rewards are scheduled to end on November 1st. During the time between now and then we could use 100% of the Deposit fee revenue to farm Qi. The Qi received through farming rewards would be distributed to Qi stakers (100%) and the rest held by the treasury for future use. After Nov. 1st the community can decide what will happen with the deposit fee LP tokens. \n\n![Current Farm Statistics](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmRTbV8wqL9hWYCprc6NHe8PCpWLMLiCodVPhW9VWe7Vuo)\n\n### Possible returns (all estimates based on current values): \n_Using tokens as is:_\nMAI-QI rewards: 12,806.16 Qi/week\nMAI-USDC rewards: 7,101.63 Qi/week\n*Total rewards: 19,907.79 Qi/week*\n\n_All in MAI-QI:_\nTotal rewards: 79,394.10 Qi/week\n*This would entail selling around 800,000 USDC from the MAI-USDC LPs received and buying Qi*\n\n_All in MAI-USDC:_\nTotal Rewards: 8,043 Qi/week\n*This would entail selling around 130,000 QI from the MAI-QI LPs received and buying USDC*\n\n### Voting Options:\n\n* Option 1: Farm using LP token revenue (As Received)\n* Option 2: Farm using LP token revenue (All MAI-Qi)\n* Option 3: Farm using LP token revenue (All MAI-USDC)\n* Option 4: Do not Farm using LP token revenue (Reject)",

      "content": "### Summary:\n\nThis proposal is to partner with mStable to incentivize MAI as a member of their stablecoin basket (as part of their feeder pool). Adding MAI to their feeder pool will bolster MAI’s peg, as it would provide for a stable exchange rate for MAI at a tighter spread than the USDC Swap.\n\n### What is mStable?\n\nmStable created a stablecoin index (mUSD) backed by a pool of stablecoins. Within this model, mStable has created feeder pools to encourage liquidity between stablecoins not in the index and mUSD.\n\n### Proposed incentives would be the following:\n\nmStable: 13,800 MTA per week\nQiDao: 5,250 Qi per week\n\n### Motivation:\n\n* Bolster MAI’s peg\n* Increase MAI’s visibility through marketing collaborations with mStable\n* Add yield opportunities for MAI holders\n\n___\n\nFor: Partner with mStable to provide incentives on MAI feeder pool\n\nAgainst: Do not partner with mStable to provide incentives on MAI feeder pool\n",

      "content": "# Summary:\n\nThis proposal is to reimburse Pickle Finance for deposit fees they incurred twice in their recent launch of MAI jar.\n\nPickle recently released a jar for MAI liquidity mining. Shortly after launching, they noticed there was a small issue with their jars. As a result, they had to migrate all LPs to a new jar and redeposit their MAI liquidity into our rewards page. This caused them to have to pay our deposit fee twice. \n\nPickle Finance covered the extra deposit fee through their treasury. To make it up to the community, Pickle will be rewarding users with 2x Pickle rewards for using their MAI jar next week. You can read more about it on their twitter thread\n\nGiven that all the funds from the jar were redeposited into QiDao rewards, we feel it appropriate to reimburse Pickle Finance for the extra deposit fees that their treasury covered (totalling 0.0195989 MAI-USDC LP tokens).\n\n# Motivation:\n\nNot charge Pickle Finance double deposit fees\nPromote good faith between projects on Polygon\n\nFor: Reimburse Pickle for the extra deposit fees paid\nAgainst: Do not reimburse Pickle for the extra deposit fees paid",

This would keep the Qi in circulation as it would be distributed to Qi stakers post-buyback.\n\n# Buyback to Treasury\n\nStore Qi from the buyback in the treasury in a separate account. Storing Qi removes it from circulation. This Qi could be burned at a later time if the community votes to do so. If burning is enabled later, it would make Qi a deflationary currency.\n\nPlease engage in community dialogue on the QIP Discussions channel on Discord https://discord.gg/hbU8SBxDsT\n",

      "title": "QIP 003: Decreasing the Liquidation Ratio",
      "content": "Through discussions on Discord and Telegram, we’ve seen some desires to rethink the liquidation process. Many in the community want to lower the downside of being liquidated. Right now, a risky vault is bought at ~149% collateral to debt ratio. This results in a loss of ~1/3 of the collateral value for the original vault owner (+ 100% of the debt is paid off and gained as an asset - 100% of the Matic is lost).\n\nIn order to minimize this loss, we propose lowering the liquidation ratio.\n\nIn addition to lowering the liquidation ratio, we could structure borrowing so that the minimum collateral to debt ratio at the time of borrowing is still 150% (on the front end), but the liquidation ratio is lower (125%). \n\nThis would both reduce the chances of being liquidated and manage the miMatic supply as it relates to locked collateral.\n\nAs the Protocol grows, we plan on implementing a stability pool to manage liquidation (subject to community discussion).\n",
