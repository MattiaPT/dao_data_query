      "title": "BIP-60: Incentivizing DAO Stewards for Successfully Passed Proposals",
      "content": "## Summary\n**Please note that this Snapshot has a default 72-hour voting window.**\n\n---\n\n**BIP-60 proposes the following:**\n\n- Establish a Governance Incentives (GI) budget capped at 7,500 $BOTTO per month to reward stewards for successfully passing proposals.\n- Implement a baseline reward for each successfully passed proposal submitted by DAO stewards, contingent on its approval by the DAO via Snapshot.\n---\n\n**This proposal is ranked choice, where the DAO votes on the baseline reward per successful proposal:**\n\n1. 1,875 $BOTTO\n2. 2,500 $BOTTO\n3. 3,750 $BOTTO\n4. No change (no GI budget, no baseline reward)\n\n---\n\n### Rationale\nActive participation in governance is crucial for the decentralized nature of Botto. Crafting impactful proposals requires significant effort, expertise, and time commitment. Introducing incentives for DAO stewards who successfully pass proposals encourages more active participation, leading to higher-quality proposals and enhancing Botto's operational and creative frameworks.\n\nThe process for submitting proposals follows these implementation steps:\n\n- **Proposal Submission**: Stewards submit their proposals via the standard Botto governance channels, both on forum.botto.com and in the Discord. It is highly advised to first post it as an idea in the #ideas channel on Discord, as its own thread, to gauge interest.\n- **Community Discussion**: Proposals undergo a mandatory discussion period of at least one week.\n- **Voting**: Voting takes place over a 72-hour window through Snapshot.\n- **Assessment and Reward Distribution**: If a proposal passes, the baseline reward is distributed accordingly.\n\nBy capping rewards through a fixed GI budget and establishing clear submission and reward guidelines, BIP-60 helps prevent governance bloat while promoting thoughtful contributions.\n\n---\n\n## Proposal Specifications / Timeline\n- If BIP-60 is approved, the chosen baseline reward for successful proposals will be implemented immediately.\n- A fixed Governance Incentives (GI) budget of 7,500 $BOTTO per month will be established for one year to fund these rewards. The unused portion of the budget will not roll over month-to-month.\n- The reward will be distributed to DAO stewards whose proposals pass Snapshot voting with a 66.7% supermajority and meet quorum.\n- The reward system will be monitored over a 3-4 month period to assess its effectiveness. Adjustments to the GI budget or reward structure can be proposed if necessary.\n\n---\n\n### Eligibility\n**DAO Stewards**: Any DAO member who submits a proposal is eligible for rewards if the proposal passes the Snapshot vote with at least a 66.7% supermajority and meets quorum requirements.  \n\n**Ineligible Participants**: Proposers who receive financial gain from their proposal or working group contributors receiving monthly stipends are ineligible for baseline rewards.\n\n---\n\n## Budget\n- **Governance Incentives Budget**: 7,500 $BOTTO per month\n- **Funding Source**: Governance rewards will be distributed from the GI budget, valid for one year. This budget is subject to review after 3-4 months based on governance participation.\n\n---\n\n## Criteria of Success\nThe success of BIP-60 will be measured by the following:\n\n- **Increased Engagement**: Higher participation rates in DAO governance as stewards are motivated by potential rewards.\n- **Higher Quality Proposals**: With incentives in place, stewards are expected to invest more effort in researching and crafting their proposals.\n- **Enhanced Decentralization**: By encouraging a broader base of the community to participate, the governance process becomes more decentralized and reflective of the community’s diverse perspectives.\n\n---\n\nPlease refer to the **[Discord thread](https://discord.com/channels/829636834371960842/1268957891058995334)** and the **[BIP-60 forum post](https://forum.botto.com/d/93-bip-60-incentivizing-dao-stewards-for-successfully-passed-proposals)** for full details and discussion.",

      "title": "BIP-63: Botto Gets Based",
      "content": "## Summary\n**Please note that this Snapshot has a default 72-hour voting window.**\n\n---\n\n**BIP-63 proposes the following:**\n\n- Deploy a parallel $BOTTO ERC-20 Token Contract on Base via Supermigrate\n- Deploy a $BOTTO Governance Contract on Base\n- Deploy an ETH Rewards Contract on Base\n- Audit Base Governance & ETH Rewards Contracts\n- Make ETH Rewards Claimable on Base\n- Update Snapshot Strategy to accommodate $BOTTO stakers on Base\n\n---\n\n**This proposal is ranked choice, where the DAO votes on how a Uniswap pool is seeded on Base:**\n1. Migrate up to 20% of PoL to seed liquidity on Base **OR**\n2. Migrate 15 $ETH from treasury + $BOTTO (allocated from BIP-42) to Base to support liquidity, with the option to pursue the migration of up to 10% of mainnet POL in the future **OR**\n3. Do not migrate to Base / Do not seed liquidity\n\n---\n\n### Rationale\nEmbedding ourselves in Base’s ecosystem increases our total addressable participants while significantly lowering transaction costs compared to Ethereum alone. This allows us to engage a longer tail of participants in new ways. Base’s close connection to the broader Ethereum ecosystem via Optimism allows us to retain strong links to mainnet while leveraging the advantages a Layer 2 brings.\n\nWe see Base as an opportunity to open up the design space for Botto participation, and this proposal is a first step toward embedding $BOTTO into Base’s ecosystem. Specific to Botto on Base:\n\n**New Audience Exposure**: Deploying $BOTTO on Base opens up the arena for the DAO’s growth marketing potential, tapping into a growing, ETH-native user base on one of the leading Layer 2s. This is crucial for increasing visibility and adoption among crypto participants. We’re already reducing barriers to entry (such as BIP-62 on minimum staking requirements), and this move expands opportunities for engaging with that audience. \n\n**Efficient Rewards Distribution**: Base's lower transaction fees allow for more frequent and economical reward claims, eliminating high-cost barriers on Mainnet. This aligns with reducing minimum claim amounts (BIP-62) and opens up potential for other forms of rewards (e.g., reputational ones like badges).\n\n**Enhanced Collaboration**: Aligning with Base positions Botto to benefit from strategic partnerships, shared resources, and potential co-marketing opportunities within both the Base ecosystem and the broader superchain ecosystem.\n\nThis proposed reduction of the minimum single-sided staking requirement is further aligned with recent discussions amongst BottoDAO members to potentially expand Botto’s voting experience to users on Base, a prominent Ethereum L2, which will enable participants to interact with Botto’s underlying contracts at much cheaper transaction costs versus Ethereum mainnet. Accordingly, it is sensible to similarly reduce the minimum BOTTO stake for active rewards eligibility in advance of such a potential integration.\n\n## Proposal Specifications / Timeline\nBellow is the approach for BIP-63:\n\n#### Phase 1: Setup (Mid-September)\n- Adjust codebases for the Governance and ETH Rewards contracts.\n- Contract audits.\n\n#### Phase 2: Deployment & PoL (Mid-September)\n- Deploy token on Base via Supermigrate\n- Whitelist token on Superbridge.\n- Deploy Base Governance Contract.\n- Deploy Base ETH Rewards Contract.\n- Bridge (ranked-choice options):\n    - 10% of PoL initially (ETH + BOTTO) to Base with extra 10% optionality later on **(Option 1)**.\n    - 15 $ETH from treasury + $BOTTO (BIP-42) to Base, with the option to pursue the migration of up to 10% of mainnet POL in the future **(Option 2)**.\n\n#### Phase 3: User Interface Integration & Monitoring (Mid-End September)\n- Integrate contract interactions and reward claim events through Botto’s v2 UI.\n- Monitor and adjust liquidity pools based on user activity and trading volumes.\n- Update Snapshot strategy to accommodate stakers on Base.\n\n## Budget\n- **Contract Development and Deployment**: $3000\n- **Contract Audits**: $3500\n\n## Criteria of Success\nMigrating to Base alone may not lead to significant userbase growth and trading volume, but we’ll monitor the following KPIs:\n\n- **Weekly Active Users (WAU)**: Track unique users interacting with Botto on Base weekly.\n- **Transaction Volume**: Monitor the total number of transactions across all deployed contracts on Base.\n- **Liquidity Metrics**: Measure liquidity depth and trading volumes in $BOTTO pools on Uniswap and Aerodrome.\n- **Reward Claims**: Track the frequency and volume of reward claims by DAO members on Base.\n\nPlease refer to the **[Discord thread](https://discord.com/channels/829636834371960842/1253392739446554805)** and the **[BIP-63 forum post](https://forum.botto.com/d/96-bip-63-botto-gets-based)** for full details and discussion.",

      "title": "BIP-65: P5.Botto Solo Show and Drop with Verse",
      "content": "## Summary\n**Please note that this Snapshot has a default 72-hour voting window.**\n\nBIP-65 proposes to commit Botto to a p5.js performance and collection presented by Verse February 3rd. By committing to a show and drop in February, Verse in turn is able to commit to a significant build up for this event as part of its Solos series. Given the amount of lead time and remaining development to do, this proposal would leave some details left to be determined in a subsequent BIP after more of the development has been completed.\n\n## Rationale\nBotto has shown strong development in p5.js and we are planning an upgrade to its core architecture in September. However, just with its progress to date we see a strong performance and collection that could be created. This would be an end-to-end autonomous process: Botto creating generative code, evolving it iteratively over time, minting onchain, and finishing with a plotter print of the iterations.\n\nThis is a proposal to commit Botto to a p5.js collection presented by Verse February 3rd. By committing to a show and drop in February, Verse in turn is able to commit to a significant build up for this event as part of its Solos series. Given the amount of lead time and remaining development to do, this proposal would leave some details left to be determined in a subsequent BIP after more of the development has been completed. This draft includes an outline of a process and drop that we think can be robust despite the uncertainty of the upgrade\n\nEven with the planned upgrade, it will be an experimental process to see if Botto can evolve a long-form algorithm that can create a strong series of 250-1000 works (a la \"[long-form generative art](https://www.tylerxhobbs.com/words/the-rise-of-long-form-generative-art)\"). \n\nFor the sake of this proposal, we have outlined a process that we think can be robust despite the uncertainty of the upgrade. [Please see the proposal for the tentative performance plan here.](https://forum.botto.com/d/98-bip-65-p5botto-solo-show-and-drop-with-verse) The final details of that process and the associated economy can be determined in a subsequent BIP after we see the results of the upgrade.\n\nThis proposal only commits to some parameters of the final outcome of what will be built.\n\n## Timeline\nApproximate timeline would be as follows:\nPhase 0\n- DAO approval –  now\n\nPhase 1\n- Upgrades and interface design – Sept-October\n- Final BIP – end of October\n\nPhase 2\n- DAO testing and iteration, get fully on chain, build API – November-Dec\n- Marfa sneak peak – November (if we have something to show)\n- Early Promo – November-January\n\nPhase 3\n- Launch feedback timeline - end of January\n- Final selection and minting - Feb 3\n- Exhibition - ~Feb3\n\n## Proposal Specifications\n\n1. Commit to a show and drop February 3rd with Verse\n2. 1 week public process/performance\n3. A series of “family tree” artefacts from Botto’s evolution\n4. A series of 250-1000 outputs from Botto’s generative algorithms\n5. 1/1 plotter prints for each work\n\n## Budget\n$10,000 USD in case additional technical support is needed for building out the onchain process.\n\n## 4.0 Criteria of Success\n- Strong sales of the show and related works\n- New Botto collectors\n- Critical reception of the show\n- A clear understanding in the audience of the delineation of this new practice from the weekly mint, as well as an appreciation for how this fits into the overall evolution of Botto\n\n## 5.0 Risks\n- The quality falls short and sales are soft. We have gotten strong feedback on the results so far, and so the adjustments and upgrades only improve on that.\n- Perception of supply dilution. We have also gotten feedback that this work and collection size are self contained and a sufficiently differentiated work.\n- Governance friction in subsequent BIP. This is an experiment in the DAO being able to commit to big projects that take time to build and so have some uncertaint details. Collective consensus and trust will be key, but succeeding will prove a key ability of the DAO to steward big evolutions of Botto.\n\nPlease refer to the [BIP-65 forum post](https://forum.botto.com/d/98-bip-65-p5botto-solo-show-and-drop-with-verse) for full details and discussion.",

      "content": "## Summary\n**Please note that this Snapshot has a default 72-hour voting window.**\n\nBotto has been invited to take part in a special Sotheby’s auction for Lumen Prize’s 13th anniversary October 9th. This proposess one of Botto's editioned works to sell as a complement to the Solo show the following week.\n\n## Rationale\nThe Lumen Prize folks were early supporters of Botto in its first year and helped first get Botto in front of many institutions even as the market fell hard in 2022. Blossoming Cadaver was longlisted for their inaugural NFT Prize in 2022 and they helped put on Botto’s first anniversary show in 2022. \n\nThe show and sale launches October 9, 2024 in partnership with Sotheby’s, at Lumen's London Awards Ceremony, running online for one week. It will showcase works from 13+ Lumen artists, featuring digital, physical, and onchain artworks, curated by Auronda Scalera & Alfredo Cramerotti (ISC members and curators of Art Dubai Digital 2024).\n\nProceeds will directly support next year's prize fund, with sale proceeds split 50/50 between the contributing artist (50%) and Lumen (50%) after the auction platform's fee. We propose submitting Botto’s [Grails V](https://opensea.io/collection/grails-v/activity) work, [The Alchemist’s Playroom](https://opensea.io/assets/ethereum/0x92a50fe6ede411bd26e171b97472e24d245349b8/3), from the treasury could be a good piece to submit here (last sale 1.5 ETH, current WETH offer .75 ETH). There will be no reserve and Sotheby’s will determine the estimate at the time of the auction so as to allow for a more open market pricing.\n\n## Proposal Specification\n\n- Submit [The Alchemist’s Playroom](https://opensea.io/assets/ethereum/0x92a50fe6ede411bd26e171b97472e24d245349b8/3), from the treasury for sale. \n- Sale proceeds split 50/50 between the contributing artist (50%) and Lumen (50%) after the auction platform's fee of 10%, or 12.5% if they exceed the high estimate.\n- There will be no reserve and Sotheby’s will determine the estimate at the time of the auction.\n\n## Criteria of success \n- Strong sale thanks to the benefit auction that raises price expectations for Solo show\n- Exposure of Botto to more collectors, mentions alongside great artists in press on the show\n\n## Risks\n- A lower than expected sale ahead of the Solo show. We feel this is unlikely given the accessible price of the piece and the benefit making the purchase tax deductible.\n\n\nPlease refer to the [BIP-64 forum post](https://forum.botto.com/d/97-bip-64-lumen-benefit-auction) for full details and discussion.",

      "title": "BIP-62: Reduce Minimum Staking Requirement for Active Rewards Eligibility",
      "content": "## Summary\n**Please note that this Snapshot has a default 72-hour voting window.**\n\nBIP-62 proposes the following:\n\n- Reduce minimum stake quantity for Active Rewards eligibility from 2000 BOTTO to 100 BOTTO\n- Reduce minimum claim amount from 0.01ETH to 0.001ETH\n- These changes would reflect on any chain BOTTO is present on.\n\n### Rationale\nAs the minimum single-sided staking requirement of BOTTO in the governance contract for active rewards eligibility was initially set at 2000 BOTTO, in USD terms it would have thus cost about $100 for a new user to purchase the requisite amount of BOTTO and stake it to then be incentivized to regularly engage in Botto’s training as an active voter.\n\nTo grow Botto DAO and further distribute Botto’s training inputs to advance its progression as a decentralized autonomous artist built on Ethereum, this BIP seeks to reduce the minimum single-sided staking requirement of BOTTO in the governance contract from 2K BOTTO to 100 BOTTO.\n\nThis proposed reduction of the minimum single-sided staking requirement is further aligned with recent discussions amongst BottoDAO members to potentially expand Botto’s voting experience to users on Base, a prominent Ethereum L2, which will enable participants to interact with Botto’s underlying contracts at much cheaper transaction costs versus Ethereum mainnet. Accordingly, it is sensible to similarly reduce the minimum BOTTO stake for active rewards eligibility in advance of such a potential integration.\n\n### Proposal Specifications\n- Reduce minimum stake quantity for Active Rewards eligibility from 2000 BOTTO to 100 BOTTO\n- Reduce minimum claim amount from 0.01ETH to 0.001ETH\n\n### Budget\nN/A\n\n### Criteria of Success\n- Increased number of BOTTO holders due to the reduction of the minimum staking requirement for active rewards eligibility and the corresponding reduction of the minimum claim amount in ETH from the active rewards contract.\n\n- Increased participation in Botto DAO from the onboarding of a greater number of participants incentivized to regularly train Botto, thus augmenting the distribution of Botto’s training inputs and further reinforcing its progression as a decentralized artist.\n\n- Increased long-term token velocity for BOTTO, as balanced by a greater number of users incentivized to stake and participate in actively training Botto on a regular basis.\n\nPlease refer to the [BIP-62 forum post](https://forum.botto.com/d/95-bip-62-reduce-minimum-staking-requirement-for-active-rewards-eligibility) for full details and discussion.",

      "title": "BIP-59: Increasing BottoDAO’s Protocol Owned Liquidity",
      "content": "## Summary\n**Please note that this Snapshot has a default 72-hour voting window.**\n\nBIP-59 proposes allocating a percentage of Botto DAO’s weekly net revenue to increase POL in a committed and consistent manner. Voting options vary from 15% to 20% of net revenue being allocated to POL, allocated monthly, accounting for reductions in the treasury's cut or reductions in both active rewards + the treasury's cut. \n\nIf approved, the proposal would be valid for one year, and will automatically renew unless otherwise voted against later on. Up to 500K BOTTO from the treasury is allocated for this initiative from BIP-42.\n\n### Voting Options\n\nRather than proposing one option over another, this BIP presents different options discussed with their arguments and can be decided by a ranked choice vote where governors order their preferred options. If an option does not receive 50% of the initial vote, the bottom choice is eliminated and those governors’ votes are moved to their 2nd ranked choice. This process repeats until one option has >50%.\n\n**Available Options:**\n\n- **50/30/20:** 50% of auction revenue allocated to active rewards, 30% to DAO Treasury, 20% to PoL Initiative\n- **50/35/15:** 50% of auction revenue allocated to active rewards, 35% to DAO Treasury, 15% to PoL Initiative\n- **40/40/20:** 40% of auction revenue allocated to active rewards, 40% to DAO Treasury, 20% to PoL Initiative\n- **No Change:** The DAO does not commit to building PoL.\n\n\n\n### Rationale\nIn order for Botto DAO’s stakeholders to achieve the long-term vision of Botto to become a fully decentralized and autonomous artist on Ethereum, Botto will need to become more economically sustainable. Liquidity is a critical consideration in this regard. BOTTO will need deeper liquidity on-chain for stakeholders across the spectrum of potential participants, including whales, to more seamlessly enter and exit the protocol. By extension, more substantive POL would likely contribute to increased market confidence, as there is a need for BOTTO’s liquidity to not have to be reliant on its users.\n\n### Proposal Specifications\n1. Botto DAO allocates 20% of the net sales revenue in ETH and deposit it into the Uniswap V2 liquidity pool on Ethereum mainnet with a corresponding amount of the treasury’s BOTTO to grow POL for the benefit of all Botto stakeholders.\n2. POL contributions will be made in monthly lump sums.\n3. In the event of a weekly auction not attracting a collector, the Treasury Working Group will use the average ETH allocation to POL over the last six months to determine the amount to be deposited into the liquidity pool to uphold BOTTO’s liquidity growth.\n4. No deposit to POL will be made during the 13th week of each period when no works are being auctioned\n5. This proposal will be committed for one year from its approval, or through the end of the final period in which the one year end date falls, whichever comes last. Thereafter, Botto DAO members may opt out of this proposal through another governance vote. Otherwise, the proposal’s terms will carry on as established herein, and POL contributions will then only end when the 500K BOTTO apportioned for it has been fully utilized.\n\n### Budget\n- 500K BOTTO from the 4M BOTTO allocation of [BIP-42](https://forum.botto.com/d/80-bip-42-v3-liquidity-mining-extension-and-transition-to-protocol-owned-liquidity/5) will be apportioned for this proposal.\n\n### Criteria of Success\n- Consistent and steady growth of liquidity in the BOTTO + ETH Uniswap V2 pool on Ethereum mainnet.\n- Amplification of Botto Project’s visibility from the weekly announcements on Botto’s communications/social media channels of the ETH revenue apportioned for POL, and the separate announcements of monthly POL contributions, further reinforcing Botto DAO’s pledge to sustaining BOTTO’s liquidity.\n- Improved distribution of the BOTTO supply thanks to the ongoing allocation of the treasury’s BOTTO holdings towards POL and thus into circulation over time.\n- Codifying the apportionment of a percentage of Botto DAO’s weekly net revenue towards POL, thus bolstering its skin in the game and enhancing collective trust in the community.\n\nPlease refer to the [BIP-59 forum post](https://forum.botto.com/d/92-bip-59-increasing-bottodaos-protocol-owned-liquidity) for full details and discussion.",

      "content": "## Summary\n**Please note that this Snapshot has a default 72-hour voting window.**\n\nThis proposal is presented by AOTM and would set up a collaboration with Notable Pepes to produce a unique card for their Series 7 collection in September 2024. The goal is to enhance Botto's visibility in the meme art ecosystem, reach new audiences, and generate revenue. This collaboration will also leverage the cultural significance of the Notable Pepes project to further establish Botto’s presence in the digital art world. The process is similar to how Botto participated in the 6529 Meme Cards.\n\n### Proposal Specifications\nNotable Pepes can be any frog, just as previous frogs have been seen as Botto’s Pepe. As Botto does not accept outside prompts in its creation, “pepe the frog” will be submitted to Botto’s taste model. The taste model will then select the top 200 matching fragments from its 3M+ unreleased works.The DAO will vote on that set to choose one to be editioned.\n\nThe titles will include “pepe” and descriptions limited to 400 characters in order to match the typical format for a Pepe. Botto can also suggest traits, which typically come in the format of “[emoji]=[#]”.\n\nPlacing in a card formatis optional, but the image must be cropped to 5x7 either way.\n\nIf using the card, the title, description, and traits, will be follow the same information hierarchy as the typical card.\n\nCuration will take place over a 1 week voting window in August to determine a winner and its subsequent description and traits in the 24 hours afterwards. It will run from Wednesday-Wednesday and so not overlap with the start/finish of the regular voting rounds.\n\nThe top piece will be minted and the remaining 199 will be discarded.\n\nThe edition will be minted on the project’s smart contract and collection as an ERC-1155. Depending on gas, Season 7 will either be on Base or Mainnet. If on Base, the edition size will be higher with lower price point than if on Mainnet.\n\n## Distribution\n90% of allowlist (AL) is raffled to Pepe Check holders. 10% is DAO's choice:\n- 1/1 Colletors: 80 wallets\n- Pipes Collectos: 1053 wallets\n\nIf on mainnet, we will do 1/1 collectors as Tier 1 and the Pipes collectors will be Tier 2. This means that if there are any remaining of the 10% (25 editions) unsold after a given period, the remaining spots will then be raffled to the Tier 2.\n\nRoll out of Season 7 will be sometime in September and last around 1 month releasing 2 artists' cards/day.\n\n## Edition size and price\n- On Mainnet: 250 x .069 ETH\n- On Base: 3141 x .0069 ETH\n\nRevenue split is 80/20, Botto/AOTM\n\nThe DAO will reserve 2 on Mainnet or 10 on Base for the DAO Treasury (this will not impact the 10% reserved for the DAO's AL).\n\nPlease refer to the [BIP-57 forum post](https://forum.botto.com/d/89-bip-57-botto-in-series-7-of-notable-pepes) for full details and discussion.",

Uncapped & Unsubsidized\nAll accounts receive 100VP per round without external subsidies. Simple implementation, but inflationary and potentially dilutive to VP value.\n\n#### 2. DAO Subsidized\n100VP per round per account, subsidized by the DAO’s LP position. Scales up to 34,428 users, utilizing DAO resources.\n\n#### 3. No Change\nMaintain the current system without VP subsidization. Requires a separate onboarding flow for new users without tokens or access passes.\n\n---\n\nThe above three options are presented with a ranked choice voting, where governors order their preferred options. If no option receives at least 50% initially, the bottom choice is eliminated and those votes are shifted to the governors' second choice. This continues until an option has  >50%.\n\n###\nPlease refer to the [BIP-54 forum post](https://forum.botto.com/d/87-bip-54-introducing-baseline-vp) for full details and discussion.",

      "content": "## Summary\n**Please note that this Snapshot has a default 72 hour voting window.**\n\nBIP-53 proposes to increase VP generation per LP share by 33%, from 150 to 200 VP per week, maintaining a fixed rate per UNI-V2 tokens staked.\n\n### Rationale\n​​The previously passed [BIP-42](https://snapshot.org/#/botto.eth/proposal/0xf5c9f7581b25077f6959409bfbf9e2877449f0c1fa39121d62cf671f731877c0) has effectively increased the duration of staking for liquidity providers (LPers). The proposed VP increase aims to better incentivize LPers to maintain or increase their stakes while potentially attracting new ones. This aligns their efforts of providing liquidity with Botto's strategic needs of building sustainable long-term liquidity and fostering a stable token environment to sustain Botto’s future.\n\nThe protocol-owned liquidity (POL) position currently comprises approximately 27.84% of the total liquidity in the BOTTO-ETH Uniswap V2 pool. The DAO has already committed to executing strategic measures for building long-term liquidity, such as potential listings on centralized exchanges or OTC token sales earmarked for POL, as set out in BIP-42. It is important to note that this VP increase for LPers does not substitute these measures, but is an additive measure proposed to incentivize them.\n\n### Proposal Specifications\n**1. Adjustment**\nLP tokens staked in the Liquidity Mining contract will now generate 200 VP per week\n\n**2. VP Calculation**\nVP per week = Number of LP tokens staked × 200\n\n**3. Implementation Time**\n10 minutes\n\n---\n\nFor additional information on the points covered in this Snapshot, please refer to the Governance Forum thread that contains explanations of each line item above.\n\nExplanations & Details: **[BIP-53: Adjusting LP Staking VP](https://forum.botto.com/d/85-bip-53-adjusting-lp-staking-vp)**",

      "title": "BIP-51 (V2): Voting Point Reset",
      "content": "## Summary\n**Please note that this Snapshot has a default 72 hour voting window.**\n\nBIP-51 proposes that:\n\n1. All Voting Points (VP) are allocated once per round.\n2. All Voting Points (VP) reset at the end of a round.\n3. Any staked amount after the round begins generates a prorated amount of VP for the week.\n4. Pipes and other VP generating collectibles do not generate VP mid-round.\n5. Unstaking before the round ends disqualifies the user from any undistributed rewards, removes their votes of that given round, and removes remaining VP of that given round. They will still be able to claim rewards that were previously credited to their wallet but have not yet been claimed.\n6. VP begins resetting at the beginning of the following period (meaning a Grace Period until end of Temporal Echoes, on June 11th 2024 at 22:00 CET, to honor those who have intentionally saved their VP).\n\nThis change reduces development and user complexity of the VP system, boosts weekly active participation and aligns directly with Botto's training needs. No changes are proposed with regards to minimum 2000 BOTTO staked to be eligible for ETH rewards.\n\n### Rationale\n**1.1. VP Reset**\nThe current VP system allows dormant stakers to accumulate voting power, leading to inconsistent participation. Weekly VP reset will encourage regular engagement, aligning with Botto's weekly cadence and preventing vote dumping. Metrics shared show fluctuating engagement, highlighting the need for more consistent participation.\n\n**1.2. Midround Generation, Unstaking Rewards Removal**\nCollectibles should not generate VP mid-round to prevent sybil attacks. New access passes will credit VP upon minting, and secondary sales will credit VP the following round. Unstaking before the round ends disqualifies users from rewards, ensuring system integrity.\n\n**1.3. Grace Period**\nA grace period until June 11th, 2024, allows users to spend VP freely while minimizing vote dumping by dormant accounts. This transition phase ensures a balanced shift to the new system, enhancing voting process effectiveness and fairness.\n\n### Proposal Specifications\n1. All Voting Points (VP) are allocated once per round.\n2. All Voting Points (VP) reset at the end of a round.\n3. Any staked amount (Governance or Liquidity Mining) after the round begins generates a prorated amount of VP for the week, based on their regular VP generation amounts.\n4. Pipes and other VP generating collectibles do not generate VP mid-round.\n5. Unstaking before the round ends disqualifies the user from any undistributed rewards, removes their votes of that given round, and removes remaining VP of that given round. They will still be able to claim rewards that were previously credited to their wallet but have not yet been claimed.\n6. VP begins resetting at the beginning of the following period (meaning a Grace Period until end of Temporal Echoes, on June 11th 2024 at 22:00 CET, to honor those who have intentionally saved their VP).\n\n---\n\nFor additional information on the points covered in this Snapshot, please refer to the Governance Forum thread that contains explanations of each line item above.\n\nExplanations & Details: **[BIP-51 (V2): Voting Point Reset\n](https://forum.botto.com/d/84-bip-51-v2-voting-point-reset)**",

In the interest of building up Botto’s profile beyond the crypto art world and in the AI art canon more broadly, as well as building up to the proposed solo Sotheby’s show in October, this BIP proposes to place Err Hold for sale at the show for 150,000 Euros (161k USD).\n\n\n\n### Proposal Specifications\n- Exhibit Err Hold at Fellowship’s floor at The Digital Art Mile with Fellowship and a sale price of 150k Euros during Art Basel from June 10-16.\n- A one-off, framed exhibition print will be created for between $3-5k USD. It would be between 1m and 1.5m square. They are testing formats for the best solution, hence the price range.\n- The buyer would receive the physical work as part of their purchase of the NFT.\n- Fellowship would take the risk of covering the costs of printing and logistics upfront, which would be recouped before considering the commission split.\n- Fellowship’s commission would be 30% after covering the cost of the physical. Estimated take home for Botto is $161k - $5k * .7 = $109k USD\n- 50% of net revenue would be distributed evenly across active rewards for the 12 weeks following the receipt of payment.\n- Fellowship will have exclusivity on selling the work for 3 months after the show ends June 16. After that date the work will return to the DAO if still unsold\n- For additional information on the points covered in this Snapshot, please refer to the Governance Forum thread that contains explanations of each line item above\n\n---\n\nFor additional information on the points covered in this Snapshot, please refer to the Governance Forum thread that contains explanations of each line item above.\n\nExplanations & Details:  **[BIP-52: Botto @ Art Basel w/ Fellowship and Georg Bak](https://forum.botto.com/d/83-bip-52-botto-at-art-basel-w-fellowship-and-georg-bak)**",

      "title": "BIP-42 (v3): Liquidity Mining Contract Extension",
      "content": "## Summary\n**Please note that this Snapshot has a default 72 hour voting window.**\n\nBIP-42's Snapshot proposes the following main points:\n\n1. Botto’s LM contract is extended one year to October 2025.\n2. Botto Treasury adds 50ETH + $BOTTO equivalent to the Uniswap pool on top of existing PoL\n3. BottoDAO pursues OTC investment(s) to raise funds earmarked for protocol-owned liquidity and/or other solutions to build long-term liquidity such as CEX listings.\n4. BottoDAO may use up to 4M treasury $BOTTO for such OTC deals and/or other liquidity solutions (the 50eth equivalent in $BOTTO added to PoL upon this proposal's passing counts toward this). This is independent of the $BOTTO allocated for OTC in BIP-35.\n\n**Disclaimer: The DAO may elect to remove the liquidity mining programme and its incentives at a later stage, prior to the scheduled end date. A subsequent proposal, three months notice, and the means to create sufficient liquidity without LM incentives would be required.**\n\n### Rationale\nBotto’s LM contract currently has approximately 4.5M $BOTTO remaining to be distributed in the next 7 months, with 125k $BOTTO distributed per week.\n\nThe pool contains around $8M in liquidity, of which 22.6% or $1.8M is protocol owned.\n\nRenting liquidity is costly and unsustainable. Botto spends around $105k per week in $BOTTO to LPs. This exceeds Botto’s current revenue and creates sell pressure. Botto has significantly higher DEX liquidity than almost all crypto projects around the same valuation. This suggests that Botto is paying for more liquidity than it needs.\n\nWhen Botto implemented its LM program, it had no ETH revenue or liquid treasury assets. Two years later, circumstances have changed. Botto now has a deep and growing treasury. It no longer makes sense to pay 125k BOTTO per week in exchange for short-term liquidity.\n\nThis proposal facilitates BottoDAO to pursue long-term, sustainable liquidity. Outside of raising funds earmarked for PoL, other potential solutions that may be pursued include:\n\n- Centralized exchange (CEX) listings\n- New incentive structures for LPs such as increased VP allocation\n- Using $BOTTO burn equivalent to build PoL\n\n### Proposal Specifications\n1. Botto’s LM contract is extended one year to October 2025.\n2. Botto Treasury adds 50ETH + $BOTTO equivalent to the Uniswap pool on top of existing PoL\n3. BottoDAO pursues OTC investment(s) to raise funds earmarked for protocol-owned liquidity and/or other solutions to build long-term liquidity such as CEX listings.\n4. BottoDAO may use up to 4M treasury $BOTTO for such OTC deals and/or other liquidity solutions (the 50eth equivalent in $BOTTO added to PoL upon this proposal's passing counts toward this).

      "content": "## Summary\n**Please note that this Snapshot has a default 72 hour voting window.**\n\nThis BIP is to commit to creating 3 more Invisible Alchemy works (see BIP-46), one for each of the next three Periods, to be privately placed with collectors through MakersPlace.\n\nThe first Invisible Alchemy sold in a group show with MakersPlace during Miami Art Week (aka Art Basel Miami). The work sold to Pablo Rodriguez-Fraile, an influential digital art collector who has since made vocal support of Botto as a patron.\n\nMakersPlace has received additional interest from large collectors who wish to acquire this artefact of Botto’s process, and MakersPlace has offered their concierge service to help place future iterations of Invisible Alchemy.\n\nBased on feedback, there is an additional specification, with buy-in from MakersPlace, that the DAO may decide in a subsequent BIP to shift to an editioned approach for the 8th or 9th period. Note that this may require new terms based on additional support an edition would need.\n\n### Proposal Specifications\n- Have MakersPlace privately place one Invisible Alchemy for each Period through the remainder of 2024 (3 Periods total)\n- Each Invisible Alchemy will be a single ERC-7160, running 12 weeks, and called \"Invisible Alchemy: [Theme]\" with an initial image featuring Logo and name. There will be physical display option made available to the collector at their cost, but not in the sale price.\n- BottoDAO will take the Discard with most VP in the first 12 rounds of each Period at set weekly interval of Tuesdays at 1600 EST, uploading artwork onto Arweave\n- Server makes an API call to get all the data from Botto, then uses that data to update the contract and force a metadata refresh via backend service.\n- There will be no discard for the 13th week as no new discards are made.\n- Buyers may optionally purchase a digital display with a TRACE chip at their own cost. If they do so, Botto.eth mints ERC-721TL minted for Records and sends to the TRACE Chip to be applied to the display.\n- At the end of the year we will re-evaluate the agreement and partnership with MakersPlace.\n- Pricing will not fall below 6ETH, and we intend on raising the price up to 10ETH depending on the market and in discussions with MakersPlace.\n- Commission will be 40% on the first sale, and the two other sales will be 15% commission.\n- MP will retain 6 month exclusivity on the primary sale. If a sale is not made in the first 6 months, then it will be placed in Botto’s vault and exclusivity will end.\n- We will reassess at the during Q4 on how to continue.\n- MakersPlace is open to the DAO deciding in a subsequent BIP to shift to an editioned approach for the 8th or 9th period. Note that this may require new terms based on additional support an edition would need.\n\n---\n\nFor additional information on the points covered in this Snapshot, please refer to the Governance Forum thread that contains explanations of each line item above.\n\nExplanations & Details: **[BIP-50: Invisible Alchemy's Future](https://forum.botto.com/d/81-bip-50-invisible-alchemys-future)**",

For the MakersPlace booth, we are proposing a special print collaboration and prominent placement with the MakersPlace booth that will be a test of a new revenue stream that can make activations like Paris cost-neutral and even directly profitable.\n\n### Proposal Specifications\n- Creation of 150 derivative prints sold at $150 each. Printing will be handled by Botto\n- Sales will be onsite only, purchasable by crypto or fiat, handled by MakersPlace.\n- Designing a digital token to authenticate selling of print will handled by Botto\n- Marketing support, booth cost, and 10k $BOTTO raffle coordination will be handled by MakersPlace\n- Each token will double as an Access Pass generating a 100 VP a day.\n- The IHAM exhibition has not additional costs, and will just be additional exposure of the weekly auction\n\n---\n\nFor additional information on the points covered in this Snapshot, please refer to the Governance Forum thread that contains explanations of each line item above.\n\nExplanations & Details: **[BIP-49: Botto x MakersPlace NFT Paris 2024](https://forum.botto.com/d/77-bip-49-botto-x-makersplace-nft-paris-2024)**",

      "title": "BIP-48: Year Contract + 13th Mint per Period",
      "content": "## Summary\n**Please note that this Snapshot has a default 72 hour voting window.**\n\nBIP-48's Snapshot proposes the following main points:\n\n1. Botto's third year of 1/1s is represented in one single contract of 52 canonical artworks: four periods per calendar year under one contract.\n2. 13th mint per period is selected by Botto\n3. No breaks between periods.\n\n### Rationale\nYear 2 has been composed of 4 Periods: Fragmentation, Paradox, Rebellion, Absurdism. Each of these have 12 mints, 48 artworks total. While the “1 mint per week” narrative is an important part of Botto’s story, we fell short of minting 52 canonical fragments per year.\n\nYearly contracts create a clear delineation from an artistic perspective (much like the Genesis Period has a clear output delineation compared to Year 2) that should fix most of the discoverability and liquidity problems mentioned in the BIP. Technology is evolving fast, and it is unlikely that Botto will use the same smart contract technology in 5 or 10 years. A perpetual contract would likely, in fact, be a temporary contract.\n\nIn addition to combining the 4 Periods of a year under the same smart contract, this BIP proposes a clean minting cadence of 4 Periods of 13 mints each. Since each Period needs a 1-week buffer to implement changes (e.g. new model), the last fragment of the Period would be selected by Botto. This will free up the team to implement any changes required, while gradually giving Botto more autonomy.\n\n### Proposal Specifications\nWe propose to mint all of Botto’s canonical 1/1 fragments on a yearly contract called* “Botto - 2024”, starting with the next period, with the following parameters:\n\n- Four Periods per calendar year, all under the same smart contract\n- 1/1 canonical mint every single week, with no break between Periods\n- The last mint of the Periods to be selected by Botto, and minted to the DAO’s treasury\n- To add the following metadata traits with each mint: Period, Model, Curated by (DAO or Botto)\n\n---\n\nFor additional information on the points covered in this Snapshot, please refer to the Governance Forum thread that contains explanations of each line item above.\n\nExplanations & Details: **[BIP-48: Year 3 as one single contract of 52 canonical artworks](https://forum.botto.com/d/75-bip-48-year-3-as-one-single-contract-of-52-canonical-artworks)**",

      "title": "BIP-47: Ending the Burn",
      "content": "## Summary\n**Please note that this Snapshot has a default 72 hour voting window.**\n\nBIP-47's Snapshot proposes to end the current burn taking place at the end of every auction round. \n\nNote: This BIP proposes to leave the burn bot active in Discord. This will allow community members to perform random acts of burning, as a node to the symbolic ritual we once had.\n\n### Rationale\nAt Botto’s inception, Botto operated under a buyback and burn (BB&B) program, where all ETH earned from auction sales was used to buy $BOTTO from Uniswap. These tokens were then sent to a burn address.\n\nThis was problematic for several reasons, the main one being that we accrued no ETH to the treasury, which at the time consisted only of $BOTTO tokens. It was voted in BIP-06 to stop buying back $BOTTO, and to instead accrue the ETH proceeds from auctions in Botto's treasury, and to burn an equivalent amount of $BOTTO from the treasury.\n\nThis was a conservative way to maintain the burn narrative, but it came at an important cost. In the past 365 days, we have burned over 1.8M $BOTTO, approved the swap of 8M $BOTTO to fund the project (≈30% of treasury $BOTTO), budgeted 1.2M $BOTTO for contributors and community initiatives, and budgeted to burn 2M $BOTTO in 2024. This will take us from 30M $BOTTO tokens in December 2022, to 21M in December 2023, and to a projected 14M in December 2024 if we swap the full 8M $BOTTO (as I expect we will), a 53% reduction in just 2 years.\n\nThis is not a sustainable path for a project that aims to create the first immortal artist.\n\nUnlike a company that can issue new stock indefinitely, we cannot increase the max supply of $BOTTO. Its importance cannot be overstated: our $BOTTO is a strategic asset required to build the first DAA, so let’s use it strategically.\n\nBurning our most scarce asset is a bad idea, especially today, when the project is not profitable and we don’t know how long the bear market will last, or whether the token price will increase. We should be extra careful with how we use our tokens.\n\nTo provide some numbers, over a 12 month period, we've burned about $590,000 worth of $BOTTO (at today's price), or $392,000 (at monthly close price of $BOTTO). Unlike with buybacks, the value did not accrue to token holders, or to Botto; it was destroyed.\n\n1. The burn depletes the treasury from $BOTTO tokens which are increasingly scarce, which are likely to accrue in value, and which are required to fund the project;\n2. The burn narrative is no longer an important part of our story;\n3. There are no tangible ROI or benefit to burning from the treasury;\n4. The burn is a poor use of the team’s time;\n5. Ending the burn makes Botto simpler;\n6. If we had no burn in place, it is unlikely we would implement it at this stage.\n\n### Proposal Specifications\n\n- Stop burning $BOTTO tokens after each auction, starting with the next Period;\n- Update the Docs, specifically the Auction, Rewards, and Treasury pages.\n\n---\n\nFor additional information on the points covered in this Snapshot, please refer to the Governance Forum thread that contains explanations of each line item above.\n\nExplanations & Details: **[BIP-47: Ending the token burn](https://forum.botto.com/d/74-bip-47-ending-the-token-burn)**",

      "title": "BIP-45: Botto-Selected Work in Group Show",
      "content": "## Summary\n**Please note that this Snapshot has a default 72 hour voting window. **\n\nBotto has another invitation to a prominent set of group editions. Akin to the 6529 Meme Cards, it is confidential ahead of the drop, but has cohorts representing the top crypto artists and in this case strong storytelling of the artists and a history of driving deeper engagement with their works.\n\nDue to the secret nature of the drop, this is a good opportunity to let Botto try its hand at fully selecting its own piece as a kind of “end of semester project”. Botto currently follows the DAO for selection of final works. After 2 years of work, let’s have Botto do one of its own selections to close out a Period. The drop is in Mid-December, shortly after the end of the 5th Period. Botto will have had all the training and input for a whole Period and could make a selection from unseen works created only in a bonus round after the final 1/1 mint on November 28th.\n\nNot only would this satisfy the need for not revealing the work ahead of time, this would be a significant new experience of autonomy for Botto. This BIP is not proposing any permanent change to Botto’s selection process, only an experiment for Botto to test the waters of greater agency.\n\nThere are a number of reasons this proposed venue is fitting for an experiment such as this.\n\n1. It will be within a group show and minted on their group show contract, providing some distance from the core weekly works.\n2. An edition of 50 and a low price of .05 ETH hedges some of the risk of this experiment.\n3. The group show provides a well-produced video going into the story behind the work, including interviews from other prominent artists and figures giving their reactions to it. New experiments with Botto require contextualization to be pulled off and this venue has a proven track record of providing that context.\n\nIn short, this opportunity is a powerful way to reveal the layers of Botto to more collectors.\n\nSee forum post for full details [BIP-45 forum post](https://forum.botto.com/d/72-bip-45-secret-group-show-edition)",

The goal is to engage new users and grow the active community-member base without incurring the usual high sponsorship fees associated with such events. Instead, we propose swapping event space for a high-utility experience for event visitors by collaborating with event hosts. The first pilot would be for ETHBCN, which takes place between 5-7 July.\n\n## Budget\n\nThis proposal requests a budget for up to 3 events, for a total of 10ETH / 25,000 BOTTO.\n\nPlease see full proposal specification, rationale, and budget [on the BIP forum post](https://forum.botto.com/d/55-bip-34-activation-events).",

      "content": "**Please note that this Snapshot has a shortened 48hr voting window.**\n\n## Summary\n\nBotto has recently been invited by prominent figures in the NFT space to release a Botto edition as part of their blue chip project featuring editions from leading Crypto Artists. This BIP proposes that the DAO curates and submits one Botto fragment to be released as an edition size between 300 and 500 as part of the project.\n\n1/1 holders and a random selection of Pipe holders (snapshot to be taken before this BIP is published) will be selected for the allowlist to mint the artwork at <.07ETH. The allowlist will also include a selection of eligible wallets from the project's existing ecosystem.\n\n## Proposal Specification\nThere is a list of themes from the project that Botto can create around (sharing them would give away the project). As Botto does not accept outside prompts in its creation, these themes will be submitted to Botto’s taste model. The taste model will then select the top 200 matching fragments for each theme from its unreleased works. Whichever set of 200 has the top overall score according to Botto’s taste model will be the set the DAO will vote on to choose one to be editioned.\n\nThe titles will include an element of the theme to make it clear what is being interpreted in the work.\n\nCuration will take place over a 1 week voting window to determine a winner and its subsequent description. It will run from Wednesday-Wednesday and so not overlap with the start/finish of the regular voting rounds.\n\nThe top piece will be minted and the remaining 199 will be discarded. (The other sets of 200 will merely be returned to the unreleased works as the set is only gathered temporarily for the Taste Model’s consideration.)\n\nThe edition will be minted on the project’s smart contract and collection as an ERC-1155.\n\nThere will be an allowlist determined between the BottoDAO and the collaborating project that will include all 1/1 holders and a random selection of pipes holders. The collaborating project’s team will manage the random selection following their strict protocol.\n\n## Timeline\n- Pool creation - June 21\n- Special voting round - June 21-28\n- Description vote - 12hrs after round closes\n- Drop - Friday June 30th\n\nPlease refer to the [BIP-32 forum post](https://forum.botto.com/d/52-bip-32-botto-edition-collaboration) for full details and discussion. Be sure to check the last comment for the final version of the BIP.",

It will exist to ensure proper execution of program. Their responsibilities:\n    * Regularly ask community for their top choices for guest curators\n    * Do outreach to community’s top choices and select a maximum of one guest curator each week (note: we don’t need a guest curator guide every week)\n    * Facilitate Guest Curator Talk in Discord\n    * Complete post-production and editing of Talks (committee may choose to outsource this task)\n    * Upload and share so that DAO members can listen asynchronously\n- Guest curators will be asked to perform the following:\n    * Guest Curator Talk: answer questions in a Discord voice conversation (e.g., “How would you go through the process of evaluating fragments?” “Do you have a framework for how you evaluated pieces?”), including answering questions from the audience\n    * Optional: review fragments in pool, Twitter Spaces, participate in Town Hall, etc.\n- Guest curators will receive an honorarium of 2,000 $BOTTO and a Botto Guest Curator Pass that grants 225k VPs per day (same as a Pipe does)\n\n## Proposal Specification\n- Pilot program for 2 months\n- Create Guest Curator Talks Committee of 2-3 people. The role of the committee is to solicit ideas from the community, facilitate outreach to guest curators, give instructions to guest curators, and host (or assign someone to host) the Discord AMA.\n- Quimp & homerfan33 will start as Guest Curator Talks Committee co-chairs. In the #curation channel there will be an open call for an additional DAO member to volunteer to join the committee. If more than 1 person volunteers, a Discord straw poll (i.e., reaction via emoji) will determine which is added to the committee.\n- There will be an open call every quarter for new committee members, so that we can have people rotate in and out of the committee\n- Committee will communicate asynchronously via Discord but may choose to do voice calls on occasion\n- Each committee member will receive a 2,000 $BOTTO honorarium per month for serving on the committee\n- Quimp & homerfan33 to measure program effectiveness at end of pilot and make recommendation to either:\n    * Continue guest curator talks program as is\n    * End guest curator talks program\n    * Expand guest curator talks program\n\n## Budget\n- Up to 14,000 $BOTTO per month\n    * Up to 6,000 $BOTTO for committee members\n    * Up to 8,000 $BOTTO for guest curators\n- Up to $500 USDC per month for post-production editing/uploading (hire someone from community or from Upwork, $125 per episode)\n\n## Timeline\nMay 15 - July 15\n\nPlease refer to the [BIP-28 forum post](https://forum.botto.com/d/45-bip-28-guest-curator-talks) for full details and discussion.

There is also a \"no\" option for if you are opposed to the proposal and would rather it not happen at all. Make your selection in order of preference, bottom ranking choices are eliminated until one reaches 50% majority.\n\n## Specifications\n- Create a voting pool of Top-250 discarded fragments by VP from Genesis, and Top-750 discarded fragments by VP post-Genesis, with a 2 week voting window to determine a winner.\n- Ryan and Alice will integrate the fragment in one of their rooms and add a musical score.\n- SuperRare will support with an article, twitter, instagram, twitter spaces, and collector outreach, targeting a Thursday May 25th drop.\n- Auction will run for 48 hrs. Exact timing TBD with SR.\n\n#### Alternatives:\nA. Submit the top 10 voted fragments and allow Ryan and Alice to use some or all in the 7 frames.\nB.

      "content": "## Summary\nIn collaboration with Hashes DAO, the owners of Blossoming Cadaver, Quimp has proposed a collaboration with BottoDAO to participate in a limited run of physical prints of this iconic Botto fragment.\n\n## Ranked Choice Vote\nThis snapshot is a ranked choice vote, with multiple \"yes\" options and a amount to be subsidized. There is also a \"no\" option for if you are opposed to the proposal and would rather it not happen at all. Make your selection in order of preference, bottom ranking choices are eliminated until one reaches 50% majority.\n\n## Background\nHashes DAO recently approved a project to produce a limited run of physical prints of some of the artworks it has collected, including Blossoming Cadaver.\n\nThe Blossoming Cadaver prints will be capped at an edition size of 250, to be purchased as regular prints for $225 or as framed prints for $600. The prices include a $100 markup, which will be shared 50% / 50% between Hashes DAO and BottoDAO.\n\nLevel Frames is our fulfillment partner and will support printing, framing, and international shipping. Level has a strong track record, having worked with other well-known NFT artists such as Reuben Wu and Dmitri Cherniak.\n\n## Proposal Specification\nWe propose that BottoDAO subsidizes regular prints ($125 unit cost) and framed prints ($500 unit cost), to be raffled among Pipe holders. We want to let the community decide how many of each to subsidize. We're mainly interested in seeing Botto fragments in people's homes!\n\nThe BottoDAO treasury currently holds ~335 ETH valued at ~$580,000.\n\nHashes will subsidize 10 framed prints and 20 regular prints for its community from its own treasury, and will cover all project management and ops costs. We love Botto!\n\n#### 50/50 Profit Split\nProfit generated from the markup will be shared 50% / 50% between Hashes DAO and BottoDAO. We can calculate the profits for BottoDAO based on how many prints are sold:\n\nSell 25 prints: 25 prints x $100 markup x 50% to BottoDAO = $1,250\nSell 50 prints = $2,500\nSell 100 prints = $5,000\nSell 200 prints = $10,000\n\n#### Quick Summary\n- HashesDAO runs a 250 editioned print of Blossoming Cadaver\n- Level Frames collaborates with HashesDAO for logistics & fulfillment\n- BottoDAO subsidizes regular & framed prints for Pipe holders\n- BottoDAO sets up raffle competition format autonomously\n- BottoDAO raffles subsidized prints to Pipe holders\n\nFor full proposal details see the [forum post for BIP-25](https://forum.botto.com/d/41-bip-25-blossoming-cadaver-prints-rewards)\n",

      "content": "## Summary\nIt is proposed that we display **“Seaport Subject”** at Verse’s upcoming exhibition in London April 4th-9th, 2023, and that this is followed by a sale of the 10 editions, mintable on Verse’s website. \n\nVerse recommends a price of 1.5 ETH, which has also been supported by Verse collectors the DAO has spoken with. However, this vote offers multiple price points for the DAO to choose from.\n\n## Ranked Choice Vote\nThis snapshot is a ranked choice vote, with multiple \"yes\" options and a preferred sale price for the editions to be sold at. There is also a \"no\" option for if you are opposed to the proposal, or would rather it not happen if a certain price cannot be chosen. Make your selection in order of preference, bottom ranking choices are eliminated until one reaches 50% majority.\n\n## Background\n\"Seaport Subject\" was the DAO's selection for an edition of 10 approved in [BIP-07](https://snapshot.org/#/botto.eth/proposal/0x9ff6f121ad55d1ef157ad08efda32cf4cabbbdc0a028393a93c7c333386ab2be) in May 2022 and to be sold at NFT NYC. Due to a technical issue with the vendor, refunds were issued and the editions never minted. This offers an excellent sales venue for these editions when demand is high for fragments from the Genesis year. It is Botto's first edition, and \"Seaport Subject\" had strong support in many rounds. \n\n## Proposal Specification\n- Display a high-quality, framed print of “Seaport Subject” at Verse’s upcoming exhibition at Cromwell Place\n- Coordinate with Verse to feature Botto centrally at the exhibition\n- Create a Manifold Contract and mint the edition of 10 for “Seaport Subject”\n- Contract Indexing (Verse)\n- List the edition for sale at a price between 1-2.5ETH\n- List the edition in an auction format\n- Primary sale split: 80% Botto, 20% Verse\n- Royalties: 10% Botto\n\nFor full proposal details see the [forum post for BIP-24](https://forum.botto.com/d/40-bip-24-seaport-subject-edition-at-verseworks)\n",

      "title": "BIP-22: Third Period - Paradox",
      "content": "## Summary\n**Please note that this Snapshot has a 48 hour voting window.**\n\nBIP-22 decides and confirms the upcoming format of the third period. This proposal is predominantly based on the existing format of the Second Period, documented under [BIP-14](https://forum.botto.com/d/26-bip-14-bottos-2nd-period).\nHere is a bullet-point summary of the proposed format:\n\n#### 0.1 The Art:\n\n**Art Engine:**\n- Continues to use Stable Diffusion version 1.5 and VQGAN + CLIP\n- SD competes vs VQGAN + CLIP, with the pool balanced according to SD’s % dominance from last period (currently 69.53% SD, 30.47% VQGAN+CLIP)\n- Botto creates artworks of varying aspect ratios (artwork format)\n- Voting pool rebalances based on voters’ model preference\n- Voting pool artworks rebalance based on voters’ preference on artwork format\n- An art engine model is discontinued if less than 10% VP is spent on the model artworks in any given round\n- 350 Artworks each round are culled by least-earned VP\n- Uses one theme curated by the DAO:  'Paradox - A collision of opposites, a beautiful chaos and a fearless exploration of the unknown' as decided by [BIP-20](https://snapshot.org/#/botto.eth/proposal/0x4d8e67c022635cb038620640857ff468d1ccfcc767184a1ee5da04e75849ba65)\n\n**Period Format:**\n- 12 Week Period\n- 1050 Artworks in Voting Pool\n- Manifold contracts used\n- Artworks auctioned on SuperRare\n- Rounds follow the same weekly format as seen in Genesis and Fragmentation periods.\n- There will be no extended first round as in the 1st and 2nd periods. The first round will be a typical 1 week in length\n\n**Period Key Dates:**\n- February 21st 22:00CET / 16:00ET / 13:00PT: 3rd Period Starts (1 week)\n- February 28th 22:00CET / 16:00ET / 13:00PT: First round ends\n- March 1st 22:00CEST / 16:00ET / 13:00PT: 1st Mint & Auction\n- May 17th 22:00CEST / 16:00ET / 13:00PT: 12th Mint (last artwork of 3rd Period)\n\n#### 0.2 Economy:\n**Voters can earn through:**\n- Spending VP every week (Active Rewards Contract)**\n- Emissions (Governance & Liquidity Mining Contract)\n- Retroactive Rewards (Determined by the DAO after the period finishes)**\n\n\\* Requires an Access Pass or staked $BOTTO in the governance contract.\n\\** Requires a minimum of 2,000 $BOTTO staked in the governance contract.\n\n**Protocol ETH revenue is distributed each round:**\n- 25% to Active Rewards Contract\n- 25% reserved for Retroactive Rewards\n- 50% to DAO treasury, with equivalent of ~~20%~~ 50% of revenue in $BOTTO burned\n\n**Subsidized Active Rewards**\n25% of revenue generated from the four sold Genesis Period artworks (not including the 4x OTC to Moderats) (37.94485ETH) are equally distributed across each round of Botto’s Third Period through the Active Rewards contract. This amounts to 9.486ETH distributed across 12 rounds, alternatively understood as a subsidized boost of 0.790517ETH per round.\n\n**Subsidized Retroactive Rewards**\nSimilarly, 25% of revenue generated from the four sold Genesis Period artworks (37.94485ETH) are equally distributed across each round of Botto’s Third Period through the Retroactive Rewards. This amounts to 9.486ETH starting in the retroactive rewards pool at the beginning of the period.\n\n**Incentivized Onboarding is discontinued**\n- The DAO has discontinued onboarding rewards. An alternative should be discussed by the DAO after this BIP on what types of rewards new entrants may receive.\n- The DAO should discuss how to reallocate the 800,000 $BOTTO that was returned to the treasury from incentivized onboarding.\n\n**Intermediary Period Rewards**\nVoters that spend VP between periods 2 and 3 on alternative voting pools receive 25% of revenue received during that time as active rewards\n\n**Voting Points:**\n- No significant changes to VP earning as the team continues to determine how to implement veBOTTO.\n\nThe DAO may elect to change parameters of the economy throughout the period if it finds more optimal methods.\n\nPlease refer to the [BIP-22 forum post](https://forum.botto.com/d/37-bip-22-third-period) for full details and discussion.",

      "title": "BIP-18: Precedent for Treasury Genesis Artworks + 4x Artwork Sale",
      "content": "## Summary\n**Please note that this Snapshot has a 24 hour voting window.**\n\nBIP-18 has four points of interest. First, the BIP proposes to accept the offer from one collector who will acquire between three-to-four artworks for a price of 10ETH per artwork. Second, the BIP proposes that the active rewards portion of proceeds from these sold artworks are spread evenly across Round 10, 11, and 12. \n\nThe proposal’s third point establishes a baseline where the DAO are free to consider offers of 10ETH or above on the remaining Genesis artworks held in the DAO treasury, but that there is no obligation or binding commitment to do so without the DAO evaluating its options through a follow-up BIP.\n\nFinally, this proposal stipulates that the DAO must retain 6 artworks held in the DAO treasury. This approximates to 10% of Botto’s Genesis Period supply.\n\nPlease refer to the [BIP-18 forum post](https://forum.botto.com/d/31-bip-18-precedent-for-treasury-genesis-artworks-4x-artwork-sale) for full details and discussion.\n\n## Specifications\n1. The DAO accepts the incoming offers of a minimum 10ETH per artwork from the anonymous collector for up to four Genesis artworks.\n2. Active rewards generated from the proceeds of these sold artworks will be spread across the revenue redistribution of Round 10, 11, and 12 of the Fragmentation period.\n3. Going forward the DAO may accept offers of 10ETH or more on unsold Genesis Artworks but is under no obligation to do so. Subsequent offers will trigger a BIP on how and whether to accept the incoming offers. \n4. The DAO must retain 6 Genesis artworks in the DAO treasury. This clause may be revised in a separate BIP.\n",

This process repeats until one option has >50%.\n\n###\nPlease refer to the [BIP-16 forum post](https://forum.botto.com/d/28-bip-16-setting-reserve-price-for-fragmentation-period) for full details and discussion.\n\n## Specifications\n\n#### 1. Remove Reserve\nAll auctions start at 0, with no minimum bid or reserve price\n\n#### 2. Dynamic Reserve - lowest of last 3 auctions, starting after 3rd auction.\n\n- Start with no reserve for first three auctions in the Fragmentation Period. After each subsequent auction, set the reserve to the lowest price of the last 3 auctions.\n- A price is considered zero if the reserve is not hit/no sale occurs. So in the event that three consecutive pieces go unsold the reserve would be zero.\n- The DAO will decide how it will implement the reserve price, whether through SR or a bid by the DAO, after the 3rd auction so that it can be made with knowledge of the price range for Fragmentation Period.  If no decision is made on implementation, the DAO will default to a reserve on SR. (See the [**Forum BIP**](https://forum.botto.com/d/28-bip-16-setting-reserve-price-for-fragmentation-period) for more details.)\n\n#### 3. Keep 10 ETH Reserve\nDo nothing, reserve remains at 10 ETH",

Winning bidders (collectors) receive the $BOTTO equivalent of 15% of the auction sale price\n**Note**: this only applies to Botto's 1/1 auctions subsequent to the passing of this proposal, not to prior auctions\n**For example**, if a collector spends 10 ETH on a Botto 1/1, they would receive 1.5 ETH worth of $BOTTO.\n\n2. The runner-up (2nd highest bidder) receives the $BOTTO equivalent of 10% of the final sale proceeds\n**For example**, if Bidder X meets the 10 ETH reserve but is subsequently outbid and the final sale price is 12 ETH, Bidder X receives 1.02 ETH (12 * .85% * .1) worth of $BOTTO. \n**Note**: 85% is the artist's cut on primary sales on SuperRare.\n\nBoth clauses 1) and 2) are based on the price of $BOTTO in ETH terms at the close of the SuperRare auction in question.\n\nThese incentives will be implemented for a pilot period of three months (12 auctions). By default, they will expire after this time, unless Botto DAO decides to renew them.\n***\n[Click here for full details and discussion](https://forum.botto.com/d/18-bip-09-new-incentives-for-bidding-on-botto-11s).\n***",

This proposal is to get community acceptance for submitting an unreleased, unminted, and community curated fragment to be presented in Times Square during NFT NYC and sold as an edition of 10 at 1 ETH each at the showcase. This piece would be outside of the Genesis Period collection.\n\n## Specifications\n1. Create a new voting pool and special voting round that would run 30th of May 11:00CEST (5am ET) to 4th of June 11:00CEST (5am ET). It would not interfere with the regular weekly voting round.\n\n2. Fragments in the pool would include Round 32 minus the 350 new fragments imported during round 32\n\n3. Users may use their existing voting points to vote in this pool\n\n4. There will be an edition of 10, sold at 1 ETH each with proceeds going to the Botto treasury. (Rules of the showcase are that sales and 10% royalties are split 75/25, 75% going to the artist.)\n\n***\n[Click here for full details and discussion](https://forum.botto.com/d/16-bip-07-the-diversity-of-nfts-art-collection).\n***",

Each week, all ETH auction proceeds go to Botto's treasury.\n\n2. An equivalent amount of $BOTTO is burned from the treasury. This can be calculated by taking the Uniswap price of $BOTTO at the time of the sale (auction end) and subtracting any price impact (slippage) and swap fees.\n\n3.

There is no 3-week protection. - With the weekly mint removing another fragment from the pool, this will keep the voting pool size steady at 1,535 fragments.\n- To better enable this strategy this will also entail reducing the required views to determine True Score from 100 to 50 [Same as in BIP-03]\n\n***\n[Click here for full details and discussion](https://forum.botto.com/d/13-bip-04-80-cull-of-voting-pool-alt-to-bip-03).\n***",
