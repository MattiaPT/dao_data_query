      "content": "## Simple Summary\n\n- Enhances 1inch's censorship resistance and frontend availability through advanced decentralized storage\n\n- Introduces cutting-edge zkDA rollup technology, providing a scalable common good for the entire DeFi ecosystem\n\n- Total grant funding requested: 80,000 USD\n\n\n\n  If this proposal passes, 80000 USDC will be transferred to the Operations Multi-Sig (0x45e84e10e8E85c583C002A40007D10629EF80fAF), and subsequently paid out to 0xD0dce95466eFB244cb7fE0111C1e81d841516165 after deliverables have been submitted according to the following milestones:\n\n\n\n* Milestone 1: Sharded Storage and Data Availability Nodes - 20000 USDC\n\n* Milestone 2: Data Management Layer - 20000 USDC\n\n* Milestone 3: Advanced Proof Integration - 20000 USDC\n\n* Milestone 4: API Development and Finalization - 20000 USDC\n\n\n\n\n\n## Abstract\n\nThis proposal outlines the development of a zkDA rollup with sharded storage for decentralized Web3 infrastructure. The project, supported by the Ethereum Foundation's Ecosystem Support Program, addresses key challenges in the transition from Web2 to Web3, focusing on decentralized storage and data availability. The proposed architecture uses zero-knowledge proofs for data availability and sharded storage, forming the basis for both recursive rollups and general-purpose data storage. This technology can significantly enhance the robustness and censorship resistance of decentralized applications, including platforms like 1inch.\n\n\n\n## Motivation\n\nThe project aims to solve several key problems in the Web3 ecosystem:\n\n1. Decentralized storage for DApps: Implementing a censorship-resistant system for storing and serving decentralized application frontends.\n\n2. Universal data availability: Developing an efficient mechanism for storing and retrieving any type of data, crucial for the decentralized web.\n\n3. Scalability through recursive rollups: Creating a system that allows rollups to be deployed on top of other rollups, significantly enhancing scalability for the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\n\n\nThese solutions will strengthen the 1inch network by improving the censorship resistance and availability of the 1inch frontend, providing a robust solution for storing critical data like exchange orders, and laying the groundwork for future scalability and advanced decentralized applications.\n\n\n\n## Specification\n\nThe project will be completed in 6 months, divided into 4 milestones:\n\n\n\n1. Milestone 1 (1.5 months): Sharded Storage and Data Availability Nodes\n\n  - Design and build the node engine for sharded storage\n\n  - Implement mechanisms for providing zero-knowledge proofs of data availability and storage\n\n  - Develop and test with a mock centralized contract\n\n  - Provide comprehensive documentation and performance benchmarks\n\n\n\n2. Milestone 2 (1.5 months): Data Management Layer\n\n  - Design and implement a data management layer with a minimal zero-knowledge smart contract\n\n  - Integrate this layer with the sharded storage nodes\n\n  - Develop methods for extending the minimal zk smart contract to more complex use cases\n\n  - Conduct thorough testing and provide updated documentation\n\n\n\n3. Milestone 3 (1.5 months): Advanced Proof Integration\n\n  - Upgrade the system to combine proofs of state transition with proofs of data availability and storage\n\n  - Implement the capability to stack data availability layers\n\n  - Conduct extensive testing of the integrated proof system\n\n  - Provide detailed documentation and performance benchmarks\n\n\n\n4. Milestone 4 (1.5 months): API Development and Finalization\n\n  - Develop an API for developers to interact with the data availability and storage system\n\n  - Implement features for efficient storing and retrieving of various types of data\n\n  - Conduct comprehensive testing with various DeFi use cases\n\n  - Finalize documentation and developer guides\n\n\n\n## Rationale\n\nOur project stands out due to its fully zk-native approach, leveraging zero-knowledge proofs throughout the entire system. It's supported by the Ethereum Foundation's Ecosystem Support Program, validating its potential impact on the broader Ethereum ecosystem. The solution targets petabyte-scale storage with potential for exabyte capacity, suitable for Web3 scale applications. By combining rollup technology with sharded storage and zero-knowledge proofs, we create a versatile solution applicable to both scalability and general data storage needs.\n\n\n\n## Considerations\n\nSecurity implications:\n\n- The project leverages zero-knowledge proofs for enhanced security throughout the system.\n\n- Extensive testing will be conducted at each milestone to ensure the security and reliability of the solution.\n\n\n\nGovernance implications:\n\n- The project requires a total grant funding of 80,000 USD, to be paid in installments upon completion of each milestone.\n\n- The project is supported by the broader Ethereum ecosystem, demonstrating its potential impact and alignment with ecosystem goals.\n\n- Long-term development and sustainability will be pursued through potential future collaborations within the blockchain industry and broader Web3 ecosystem.\n\n- The technology developed in this project has wide-ranging applications across various blockchain platforms and Web3 projects, offering numerous opportunities for collaboration and improvement of the overall Web3 infrastructure.\n\n\n\n\n\nTeam qualifications:\n\nThe project will be executed by the ZeroPool team, consisting of:\n\n- Igor Gulamov: ZK researcher, blockchain developer\n\n- Alexandra Gulamova: Strategy, marketing\n\n- Ivan Oleynikov: Cryptographer\n\n- Dmitry Vdovin: ZK engineer, blockchain developer\n\n- Evgenii Filippov: DevOps\n\n- Anton Pegov: Frontend developer\n\n\n\nThe team has a strong background in blockchain research and development, with a focus on zero-knowledge proofs and scalability solutions.",

      "title": "[1IP-63] The Grand Timeline Grant Proposal",
      "content": "**Author:** [stepahin](https://gov.1inch.io/profile/id/158358)\n\n## **Simple Summary**\n\n\n\nThe Grand Timeline project requests a grant from the 1inch DAO to support the development of a unique educational project that aims to create the first comprehensive visual timeline of blockchain and Web3 history. The project will serve as an engaging and accessible \"source of truth\" for the crypto community and beyond, helping to attract new people to the Web3 space and drive its mass adoption. The project is the first of its kind, not only for web3 but in general.\n\n\n\n![](https://jbm.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmVm1sgUt99XS13vu66Ut7qGrzAxhYW7RW8AL9twYC6vUF)\n\n\n\n![](https://jbm.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmY24bcPAQtkaUhJWCQKLQn6GXUTfd3DaVHqRst3xXwXLh)\n\n\n\n![](https://jbm.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmZ9VwYv64vxCVQxY6hemjcfvQsjZd6WJTwd7JGTznXcc4)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## **Abstract**\n\n\n\nThe Grand Timeline is a historical research and data visualization project that maps the entire history of blockchains and Web3 on an 8 meter / 26 feet wide static canvas, with plans to develop an interactive version in the future. The project aims to solve the problem of fragmented and difficult-to-access information about the history of Web3 by providing a comprehensive, visually engaging timeline.\n\n\n\nThe objective is to make complex information about Web3 accessible and engaging for current and potential community members, fostering greater understanding and interest in the space. The funding from 1inch DAO will enable to focus on research, design, and development, bringing the project to completion within the next 10-12 months.\n\n\n\nCurrently, the timeline has five different layers:\n\n\n\n- People\n\n\n\n- Events\n\n\n\n- Price Highs & Lows\n\n\n\n- Phases\n\n\n\n- Hacks & Scams\n\n\n\nThey are in various stages of completion, with the most significant work ahead being in the Events layer, which requires extensive research, fact-checking, prioritizing, editing, and design, editing again and review.\n\n\n\n## **Motivation**\n\n\n\nThe crypto and Web3 ecosystem lacks a quick, comprehensive \"source of truth\" that covers the full history, key players, and significant developments in an easily digestible format. Engaging with the existing content often requires significant time and effort, which can be a barrier to attracting new participants to Web3.\n\n\n\nThe Grand Timeline addresses this gap by presenting the history of Web3 in a new, visual format that captures attention and engages a broad audience, including those outside the existing crypto community. The visual appeal of the timeline will help demystify the history and development of Web3, sparking curiosity and fostering broader adoption.\n\n\n\n## **“Team” and Background**\n\n\n\nI'm Igor Stepahin, a product designer and researcher, former head of design at Gelato. The Grand Timeline started as my solo side project three years ago, documenting the entire history of Web3 and crypto. I've been working on it on and off, but now I want to focus on it full-time to complete it within a year. As the project grows, I plan to bring on an additional researcher and a frontend developer to support its development and ensure its timely completion.\n\n\n\n## Current Progress\n\n\n\nThe current version is called v.0.4, which roughly reflects that the project is halfway through. The project was started 3 years ago as a side project and was developed from time to time.\n\n\n\nNow, the Figma project is published and work continues openly\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere's the current progress of different layers of data:\n\n\n\n■■■■■□□□□□  People\n\n\n\n■■□□□□□□□□  Events\n\n\n\n■■■■■■■■■□  Highs & Lows\n\n\n\n■■■■■■■■□□  Phases\n\n\n\n■■■■■■■□□□  Hacks\n\n\n\n![](https://jbm.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmZC3EnHCgVKbQL7JwV9Jk23d92zcbKYkAUYVBTQdPD55j)\n\n\n\n“Proof of work”, the time-lapse of all progress over 3 years → [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lkVy6JzlyNY)\n\n\n\n## **Project Roadmap (10-12 Months)**\n\n\n\n1. **Website Update (2 weeks):** Improve the existing website ([grandtimeline.org](http://grandtimeline.org/)) to better explain the project's goals and progress and a quick compromise solution with a custom Figma embed directly on the website until a full interactive version is available — **This has already been completed while the proposal was being prepared and reviewed.**\n\n\n\n2. **Research and Finalization of the Events Layer (8-12 weeks):** Complete detailed research on the evolution of Web3, focusing on the DeFi era and the role of DEXs.\n\n\n\n3. **Filling the Entire Layer of People (6-8 weeks):** Complete profiling of key figures in Web3 history (target: 250-300 people).\n\n\n\n4. **Review the Static Version v.1.0 Ready for Printing (6-8 weeks):** Finalize the content of all layers and submit for community and expert review.\n\n\n\n5. **UI and Prototype of the Interactive Version (4 weeks):** Develop a prototype with an intuitive navigation system.\n\n\n\n6. **Development of the Interactive Version (8-10 weeks):** Develop and launch the web-based UI for the timeline.\n\n\n\n## **Funding Request**\n\n\n\n**Total Grant Value: $25,000**\n\n\n\n$10k upfront + $15k streamed over 5 months\n\n\n\nThe funds will be used to pay for working hours on:\n\n\n\n- Research and content development on key events, figures, and milestones in the history of DeFi and DEXs\n\n\n\n- Design and finalization of the static timeline (v.1.0)\n\n\n\n- Development of the interactive version, including UI/UX design\n\n\n\n- Community engagement and content review by crypto historians, journalists, authors, researchers and experts\n\n\n\n**Payment Structure:**\n\n\n\nIf this proposal passes, 25,000 USDC will be transferred to the Operations Multi-Sig (0x45e84e10e8E85c583C002A40007D10629EF80fAF), and subsequently paid out to 0x4A56342f27ae744755922936030a37dE993Bcdea as follows:\n\n\n\n1. An initial payment of 10,000 USDC will be made upfront.\n\n\n\n2. The remaining 15,000 USDC will be streamed over a period of 5 months.\n\n\n\n## Year Budget\n\n\n\nThe goal is to raise $100k-$150k for a year of work on the project, which will fund a full-time Designer-Researcher, Frontend Dev, and Second Researcher and will bring the project to a perfect final release. To avoid bias, the idea is to have the initiative funded by a range of different organizations from our big community.\n\n\n\n## **Current Support and Validation**\n\n\n\nThe project has already received support and small grants from Lido and TON devs, and 17 individual donations on Juicebox, total ~$17,500 within three months of publication which is a good result with zero starting audience and without influential figures behind it.\n\n\n\nNotable people in the community who have shown interest / likes / RTs: Camila Russo, Tim Copeland, banteg, Sergej Kunz & Anton Bukov, Roman Storm, Lido Team, Vlad Zamfir, Robert Leshner, Sam Kazemian, Juicebox Team, Riccardo Spagni, some Optimism gov members, Devin Walsh (Uniswap Foundation), Evgeny Yurtaev and more…\n\n\n\n## **Community Benefits**\n\n\n\n- The project has been well-received and seen as positive and educational. It has not gotten any negative comments. If 1inch sponsors the timeline, it would be linked to this popular project, which could boost how people see the 1inch brand\n\n\n\n- Clickable 1inch logo featured permanently in the sponsors/supporters section, in the current Figma work-in-progress version, in all printed versions, and in the future interactive version (this section is currently small, the place and size will be adjusted later)\n\n\n\n- The project will be updated and remain relevant for many years, with 1inch and all early supporters remaining there permanently\n\n\n\n- Some suggesting it deserves museum display. While not traditional art, it aims to reach a level of historical significance that could one day see it, along with 1inch, featured in a museum exhibitions\n\n\n\n- Already received an invitation to display the timeline on one conference next year, which also increases visibility for sponsors\n\n\n\n- The DeFi and DEXs history and events section, where 1inch plays a significant role, will definitely receive a lot of attention and be developed as thoroughly as possible (this doesn't mean there will be any bias in opinion towards sponsors)\n\n\n\n- 1inch will receive a certain number of printed copies to distribute as they wish\n\n\n\n- If the final printed version generates unexpected profits beyond covering ongoing research and project expansion costs, grants will be proportionally returned to the DAO and supporters to ensure fairness (it doesn't affect the other points)\n\n\n\n- Ultimately, we all benefit from attracting more wonderful new people to web3\n\n\n\n## **Conclusion**\n\n\n\nBy funding \"The Grand Timeline,\" 1inch DAO will support a unique public good that enhances understanding and engagement with Web3, promoting greater adoption of decentralized technologies. The project's success will reflect positively on the 1inch brand, aligning it with education and innovation in the Web3 space.\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n\n### Links\n\n\n\nWebsite [https://grandtimeline.org](https://grandtimeline.org/)\n\n\n\nArticle about [https://x.com/GrandTimeline/status/1818217503362867394](https://x.com/GrandTimeline/status/1818217503362867394)\n\n\n\nFigma [https://www.figma.com/design/pENhenndHyIMwzW2LgKzNd/](https://www.figma.com/design/pENhenndHyIMwzW2LgKzNd/The-Grand-Timeline?node-id=0-1&t=rAWSLAihqLdUDVqM-1)\n\n\n\nPortraits [https://x.com/stepahin/status/1808545844397838775](https://x.com/stepahin/status/1808545844397838775)\n\n\n\nTime-lapse [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lkVy6JzlyNY)\n\n\n\nX [https://x.com/grandtimeline](https://x.com/grandtimeline)\n\n\n\nAuthor [https://x.com/stepahin](https://x.com/stepahin)",

      "title": "1IP-62: Termination of Relationship with Hardware Wallet ",
      "content": "## Simple Summary\n\nThis proposal seeks to terminate 1inch DAO’s contract with Mr. Alexey Devyatkin and Hardware Wallet Team, and receive the compensation of the 2 million USD funding (the “Funding”) provided to Mr. Devyatkin under the [[1IP-30] 1inch Hardware Wallet production completion](https://snapshot.org/#/1inch.eth/proposal/0x4195b95089726f57caab2727aa16075794d9f817007ffac6ba40cabadaadc956) (the “Proposal”) in full. Mr. Devyatkin has repeatedly breached the commitments made in the Proposal, has failed to deliver any significant results, and has mismanaged the funds.\n\n  \n\nAdditionally, this proposal demands the immediate transfer of all deliverables to the 1inch DAO’s control, cessation of all use of the 1inch brand by Mr. Devyatkin and the HW Team, and a comprehensive report on the current development status. These demands will be enforced through a designated Representative.\n\n  \n\nWe believe it is in the best interests of the 1inch DAO and Community to pursue these actions and continue the development of the 1inch Hardware Wallet independently.\n\n  \n\nThis is a summary version of the full proposal. Please refer to [link to forum] for more details.\n\n  \n## Abstract\n\nUnder the Proposal, Mr. Devyatkin and the Hardware Wallet Team (“HW Team”) received 2 million USD to complete the product trade version (PTV) of the 1inch Hardware Wallet. This Proposal, approved by the 1inch DAO on June 12, 2023, was based on the Community's trust in Mr. Devyatkin’s ability to deliver.\n\nHowever, none of the commitments made by Mr. Devyatkin have been fulfilled. He pledged to: (1) complete the Hardware Wallet by achieving 7 Milestones, (2) making it available for sale by Q4 2023, (3) prudently use the funds to ensure high-quality output, and provide regular progress updates.\n\nMr. Devyatkin has failed to meet these commitments, violating the trust of the 1inch Community and breaching the binding agreement with the DAO. We recommend the 1inch DAO vote to recover the 2 million USD in funding and enforce the additional demands listed below.\n\n  \n\n## **Motivation**\n\nThis proposal aims to:\n\n-   Recover the Funding and transfer Deliverables to the DAO’s control to continue the 1inch Hardware Wallet development with a new team.\n    \n-   Protect the 1inch brand’s reputation by ensuring it is associated with high-quality products made by dedicated contributors, maximizing community benefits.\n    \n\n  \n  \n\n## **Conclusion of Breaches**\n\nDetailed specification of Breaches can be found in the Forum discussion [\\[link to the forum post\\]](https://gov.1inch.io/discussion/24860-1ipxx-termination-of-relationship-with-hardware-wallet)\n\n  \n\nMr. Devyatkin's mismanagement of the project constitutes a material breach of the Proposal, severely impacting the benefits the DAO was entitled to receive. His failures significantly undermine the Proposal’s expected outcomes, justifying termination and recovery of the full Funding amount. Key breaches include:\n\n  \n\n-   **Failure to Meet Milestones**: Not a single one of the seven promised milestones has been fully completed. Originally set for delivery by the fourth quarter of 2023, the project has been repeatedly delayed, with the current timeline pushed to the first quarter of 2025. This extensive delay fundamentally undermines the project's goals and the DAO’s expectations.\n    \n\n  \n\n-   **Lack of Transparency**: Mr. Devyatkin failed to provide timely and adequate progress reports to the community. Reports were only issued months after the expected completion date, without proper consultation or explanation. This lack of transparency violates the commitments made in the Proposal and erodes trust.\n    \n\n  \n\n-   **Mismanagement of Resources**: Mr. Devyatkin has failed to provide transparency regarding the use of funds, leaving the Community in the dark about the budget and its allocation. Despite receiving significant resources, no milestones have been completed, and the project is severely delayed, raising concerns about his project management capabilities.\n    \n\n  \n\nGiven these breaches, the DAO is justified in terminating the Proposal and seeking full compensation for damages caused by Mr. Devyatkin’s mismanagement.\n\n  \n  \n\n**Suggested Course of Action**\n\n  \n\n1.  **Representation**\n    \n\n  \n\n1inch DAO should engage an external legal counsel or request 1inch Foundation or other contributors to represent 1inch DAO in any further communications with Mr. Devyatkin (“Representative”). The Representative shall present Mr. Devyatkin with the demands, voted for by 1inch DAO and further communicate with Mr. Devyatkin regarding the resolution of this issue. Should negotiations fail, the Representative shall take further legal action. The Representative shall regularly report to the 1inch DAO on the status of negotiations and the proposed resolution.\n\n  \n\n2.  **Demands**\n    \n\n  \n\nTo remedy the breach of the Agreement, Mr. Devyatkin and HW Team shall comply with the following demands.\n\n  \n\n1.  **Compensation of the Funding**. Mr. Devyatkin and HW Team shall return the full amount of the Funding constituting the equivalent of 2 million USD to 1inch DAO Treasury within 10 (ten) calendar days from the ending of the Snapshot vote for the proposal (if passed). In case Mr. Devyatkin and HW Team fail to return the full amount of the Funding as set forth herein, the Representative shall take necessary enforcement actions.  \n      \n    \n\n1inch DAO Treasury Wallet Address: 0x7951c7ef839e26F63DA87a42C9a87986507f1c07.\n\n  \n\n2.  **Transfer of the deliverables**. Within 15 (fifteen) calendar days from the ending of the Snapshot vote for the proposal (if passed), Mr. Devyatkin and HW Team shall transfer any and all deliverables produced by them under the Proposal and pertaining to 1inch Hardware Wallet to the 1inch Github Repository [https://github.com/1inch/community](https://github.com/1inch/community), (“Repository”), including:\n    \n\n  \n\n-   All the software developed by Mr. Devyatkin and the HW Team under the Proposal, any source code and documentation related thereto;\n    \n-   Test application for the protocol for IOS and Android operating systems, including the source code thereof, that Mr. Devyatkin and HW Team were provided access to;\n    \n-   All other Deliverables referred to above and any other software,that Mr. Devyatkin and HW Team were provided access to;\n    \n-   All technical, assembling, engineering, certification, instructional and any other documentation and materials that directly or indirectly concern the operation and/or production of the Hardware Wallet, or that have been named by Mr. Devyatkin in the reports published in March 2024 and July 2024, that Mr. Devyatkin and HW Team have access to.\n    \n\n  \n\nBy transferring the deliverables, Mr. Devyatkin and HW Team transfer any right, title an interest in such deliverables, and shall only have the possibility to further use the deliverables if 1inch DAO provides them with the permission in line with the general procedure described below in Section (c).\n\n  \n\n3.  **License as Source-Available Project**. As per the Proposal, Mr. Devyatkin has committed to open-source the hardware wallet project ‘to the extent that it does not harm 1inch DAO, the 1inch product, or the security of the hardware or software components’. Considering the incompleteness of the project, we believe it is in the best interests of the DAO to demand the publishing of the deliverables under the BUSL-1.1 source-available license. The Change License shall be GPLv3. The Change Date shall be in 15 years. The license shall include a clause for exceptions to the BUSL License, subject to the vote of the 1inch DAO. Such choice of the license ensures best commercial interests of the 1inch DAO, while publishing the code for the Community, providing ample opportunities for contribution with 1inch DAO’s consent.\n    \n\n  \n\n4.  **Cease and Desist from  using 1inch Brand**. In the interests of integrity of the 1inch brand, Mr. Devyatkin and the HW Team shall immediately cease and desist from using 1inch brand, its elements and trademarks (“1inch Brand”), including:\n    \n\n  \n\n-   Do not use 1inch Brand in  any form of public communication, including but not limited to marketing materials, advertisements, social media posts, and any other promotional content.\n    \n-   Terminate any direct or indirect mentions of any cooperation, partnership or affiliation whatsoever with the 1inch Brand in any public communications.\n    \n-   Terminate the use of the 1inch Brand in any social media handles, accounts, corporate or private email address and other equivalent mediums.\n    \n-   Terminate the use of 1inch Brand in the production, design, and development of the Hardware Wallet or any other products.\n    \n\n  \n\n5.  **Report**. Within 15 (fifteen) calendar days from the ending of the Snapshot vote for the proposal (if passed), Mr. Devyatkin and the HW Team shall prepare a technically precise and extensive report that would explicitly describe: the purpose of each source code file, documentation, material, instruction or other item uploaded to the Repository, with respective links to the materials in the Repository. The report should also include the current stage of development and testing of each item. The report shall be posted in the Repository and/or on the forum of the 1inch DAO. The Report shall be sufficient to enable any person with required skill and knowledge to understand how the Hardware Wallet and its components can be produced, assembled and integrated.\n    \n\n  \n  \n\n## Final Words\nThe facts outlined above clearly show the urgent need for 1inch DAO to take decisive action against Mr. Devyatkin. His consistent failure to meet milestones, lack of transparency, and mismanagement of resources have severely compromised the project's success and the DAO’s interests.",

This change is motivated by the implementation of the Exclusive API, which mitigates Resolver gas price wars and makes the priorityFee cap unnecessary.\n\n## Motivation\n\nCurrent gas fee limitations that were implemented with [[1IP-43]](https://snapshot.org/#/1inch.eth/proposal/0x09d04402e676a034398615391c34df0e30a515518f93df802f29c131707f9b63) are no longer needed due to the introduction of the Exclusive API, which grants resolvers an exclusive window to execute orders without competing in gas price wars. The current priorityFee restrictions disadvantage highly gas-optimized resolvers and lead to inefficiencies.\n\nRemoving the priorityFee cap will:\n\n- Ensure a level playing field for highly gas-optimized resolvers.\n\n- Enhance the overall efficiency of the 1inch Fusion mode.\n\n## Specification\n\nThis proposal serves as a signal from the 1inch DAO to 1inch Labs and 1inch Foundation.\n\n### Elimination of the PriorityFee Cap:\n\n-  Modify the 1inch Fusion mode smart contracts to [remove the priorityFee cap](https://github.com/1inch/limit-order-settlement/blob/master/contracts/Settlement.sol#L31) linked to the block’s baseFee.\n-  Deploy a new settlement extension\n\nIf passed, this proposal signals to 1inch Foundation to update the enforcement terms for Resolvers to reflect these changes.\n\n## Rationale\n\nThe Exclusive API grants an exclusive slot for the best quote from a Resolver to execute a Fusion mode order, preventing gas price wars that mandated the priorityFee cap.\n\nThis change ensures:\n\n- Alignment with the new system where gas price optimization no longer benefits from the cap, making it redundant.\n\n- Gas-optimized resolvers are not disadvantaged by the caps.\n\n- Fair chances for all resolvers to execute orders efficiently.\n\n- Less value is lost to block builders.\n\n## Considerations\n\nThis change requires an update and redeployment of the Fusion mode settlement smart contracts. All changes should be thoroughly tested to ensure no negative impact on gas costs and order execution efficiency.",

      "content": "**Author:** [sokravtsov](https://gov.1inch.io/profile/id/150974)\n\n# Simple Summary\n\nPapaya will develop a convenient and useful tool for 1inch DAO to stream grants directly from Snapshot. There's no product like this on the market yet, and you need it. 1inch DAO has distributed over 2 million USD in grants, so you should have an easy way to start grant streaming directly from Snapshot and revoke it if the agreed conditions aren't met. \n\n\n\n# Abstract\n\nPapaya is a cool scalable money streams protocol, that makes convenient tokens streaming and subscription-based services on-chain. Imagine things like Netflix, Spotify, or OnlyFans. It can handle thousands to billions of subscribers with fixed gas costs, ensuring infinite scalability and minimal transaction fees. Our smart contract, [audited by Stronghold Security](https://x.com/papaya_fi/status/1806255443582267600), is deployed on 7 chains: Ethereum, Polygon, BNB Chain, Arbitrum, Avalanche, Base, and Scroll. [Dapp v1](https://app.papaya.finance) has been released.\n\n\n\n# Motivation\n\n- 1inch DAO will have the ability to initiate grant streaming directly from Snapshot after a vote.\n\n- 1inch DAO will be able to revoke the grant stream and secure their funds from Snapshot if the terms of the agreement are not met.\n\n- 1inch DAO can also use this tool to pay their contributors. Since large sums are often allocated, it would be better to distribute them in portions and control the process with streaming tool.\n\n\n\n# Specification\n\n![image](https://s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/assets.commonwealth.im/748cdfb2-f2a5-4231-a71b-700e1272a7c4.1721760007857)\n\nPapaya protocol will be integrated into Snapshot, allowing 1inch DAO to conveniently start grant streaming immediately after a vote. \n\n![image](https://s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/assets.commonwealth.im/ed249078-c78b-4409-a81f-7bc5d33a1ba7.1721760050902)\n\nWhen creating a proposal, you specify the recipient's address, the amount, and the duration of the stream in months.\n\n![image](https://s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/assets.commonwealth.im/0ff8b685-4297-4828-aa4f-8b869468edf7.1721760159583)\n\nThe progress of the streaming, including how much has been streamed and how much remains, will be displayed on snapshot.\n\n![image](https://s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/assets.commonwealth.im/3ab858ca-81f6-4bce-98be-808184b2c0a8.1721760201686)\n\nA proposal can be created to revoke a previously issued grant if the agreed-upon conditions are not met by the other party.\n\n![image](https://s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/assets.commonwealth.im/da848725-9cce-49f3-ad14-29e223f0af18.1721760293925)\n\nAfter the vote, the grant stream will stop and 1inch DAO will be able to save its funds from unauthorized spending.\n\n![image](https://s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/assets.commonwealth.im/5b91a7fc-2278-478c-9ebb-53c347199c02.1721760386106)\n\nFlow diagram.\n\n\n\nPapaya protocol supports multiple use cases:\n\nGrants: Gradual funding with the flexibility to revoke based on performance.\n\nPayrolls: Daily payouts to contributors, ensuring transparency and reducing end-of-month uncertainties. In the case of a long-term contract, 1inch DAO doesn't need to transfer the entire amount upfront; a stream can be started at the necessary rate.\n\n\n\n- [Website / Dapp](https://papaya.finance/)\n\n- [X](https://x.com/papaya_fi)\n\n- [Anton Bukov Speech](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zs9qmlr8TVA)\n\n- [Medium Article](https://papaya-finance.medium.com/introducing-the-papaya-money-streams-subscriptions-protocol-454faa2d7b19)\n\n- [Github](https://github.com/papaya-metaverse/Papaya/)\n\n\n\n# Rationale\n\nOur primary motivation for developing and launching the Papaya Streams Snapshot Tool is to provide the 1inch community with a secure, scalable, and user-friendly solution for managing grant distributions. \n\nTo date, we have achieved several milestones including:\n\n- Integration of Papaya protocol with 7 major blockchains: Ethereum, Polygon, BNB Chain, Arbitrum, Avalanche, Base, and Scroll.\n\n- Development and release of Dapp v1.\n\n- Completion of a comprehensive audit by Stronghold Security.\n\nBy using Papaya’s protocol, 1inch DAO will be able to distribute grants more efficiently and transparently. \n\n\n\n\n\n# Considerations\n\nOur team comprises seasoned professionals with extensive experience in web3, blockchain technology, and DeFi. The team has a strong background in computer science and has worked with leading blockchain companies.  We can develop this product within max 10 months for $200k. Once the product is ready, we ask the foundation to choose the preferred audit company and allocate the necessary funds to ensure the max grade of security of the protocol. \n\nThe implementation of the Papaya protocol will enable 1inch DAO to significantly enhance the transparency and efficiency of grant distribution, ensuring careful use of funds and the ability to revoke streaming grants if conditions are not met. This innovative tool will be developed and ready for use within 10 months, allowing you to quickly start reaping its benefits. Our product will provide convenient and comfortable management of grants and payments, with flexible fund flow regulation and daily payouts to participants. The Papaya protocol is deployed on 7 blockchains and has been audited by Stronghold Security, ensuring reliability, security, and compliance with high standards.\n\nWe would like to receive the grant funds to our multisig address 0xEd892bCBf52B4A18e793D66025e64F52dccCd5De through our streaming protocol at app.papaya.finance in USDC. Just set the stream rate to $20k/month (Total 10 months - $200k).\n\n*From our side, we will recognize that 1inch DAO supported Papaya in its early stage.\n\n****\n\nNote: The DAO Operations Multisig: \t[eth:0x45e84e10e8E85c583C002A40007D10629EF80fAF](https://gov.1inch.community/docs/governance/dao-treasury/#1inch-dao-treasury-addresses) will be used to create the papaya payment stream.

      "title": "[1IP-57] 1inch Security Grant Proposal",
      "content": "**Simple Summary**.\n\nThis proposal seeks funding from the 1inch DAO to improve the security position of the 1inch Network by purchasing 1inch Security, a DeFi compliance bundle soon to be available on the 1inch Dev Portal. 1inch Security consists of **(1) security solutions from four market-leading providers – TRM Labs, Blockaid, Blowfish and Etherscan and (2) the services of a forensic investigator.** 1inch Security will help identify and block malicious transactions, prevent loss of user funds, and protect the 1inch Network's reputation and products.\n\n\n\n\n\n**Abstract**.\n\n1inch security solution consists of two equally necessary components: (1) automated security tools and (2) a blockchain forensic investigator who can quickly react to emerging threats, investigate incidents, monitor reports from the automated tools, and take a holistic approach to security for the Network.\n\n\n\n**A.\tAutomated Security**\n\n\n\n1. TRM Labs:\n\n- Address Screening\n\n\n\n\n\n2. Blockaid:\n\n- dApp Scanning\n\n- Transaction simulation and validation\n\n- Address validation\n\n- Malicious token detection\n\n\n\n\n\n3. Blowfish:\n\n- Transaction scanning and simulation\n\n- Message scanning\n\n- Domain scanning and blocklist\n\n\n\n\n\n4. Etherscan:\n\n- Data from the leading Ethereum Block Explorer catered for labeling and fast reactive security actions.\n\n\n\n1inch Security intentionally includes overlapping services. Because each provider uses its own sources and methods to analyze blockchain data, using two providers to simulate and validate transactions, for example, solves for any lags or false results from a single provider and gives additional comfort to users. \n\n\n\n**B.\tBlockchain Forensics Investigator**\n\n\n\nBecause automated tools cannot always react in real time to emerging threats, intervention from a live person can mean the difference between massive and minimal losses due to hacks and scams. Engaging a blockchain forensic investigator who can blacklist problematic addresses immediately upon discovery, as well as investigate potential false positives using various existing forensic tools (Breadcrumbs, Chainanalysis, OSINT etc.), strengthens the automated compliance layer. \n\n\n\nThus, 1inch security silution includes the services of an experienced blockchain analyst.\n\n\n\n**Total Grant Value: $400,000 USDC.**\n\n\n\n**Motivation**.\n\nThe goal of this proposal is to protect users of 1inch Network products and services from malicious actors, and to prevent the use of 1inch Network products and services for illicit purposes. \n\n\n\nAs a leading DeFi project, 1inch Network sets an example for others. By investing in best-of-class security solutions, 1inch Network solidifies its reputation and brand in the market and beyond.\n\n\n\n**Specification**.\n\n\n\n**A. Security solutions providers.**\n\n1inch Security includes a full suite of leading security tools chosen by 1inch Limited to provide effective defense against illicit activity, scams and hacks. \n\n\n\n1. Address Screening [TRM Labs]. \n\nThis tool screens each user address at the address connect or address transfer entry point. Every interaction with 1inch dApp or 1inch Wallet App tools is monitored and screened. For Legacy Mode swaps, all user addresses that connect to the 1inch dApp are screened. For Fusion Mode and Limit Order swaps, the maker and taker for each settlement, as well as all user wallet addresses that connect to the 1inch dApp, are screened.\n\n\n\n2. dApp Scanning [Blockaid and Blowfish]. \n\nThese tools use a dApp's URL to analyze whether it is safe to use or not, identifies attack types used by a malicious dApp and which chains it operates on, as well as its other Web3 interactions. The Blowfish tool can also automatically block a harmful dApp before a user visits it. \n\n\n\n3. Transaction simulation and validation [Blockaid and Blowfish]. \n\nPrior to signing a transaction, these tools return a full simulation, including how the transaction will change the blockchain state, the execution flow of the stack, a recommended action based on whether the transaction is safe to sign or not, and reasons why the transaction was flagged.\n\n\n\n4. Message scanning [Blowfish]. \n\nPrior to showing a message signing interface to the user, this tool evaluates the message itself for markers of malicious intent. \n\n\n\n5. Address validation [Blockaid]. \n\nThis tool assesses an address for risk based on a list of addresses classified as malicious by the provider.\n\n\n\n6. Malicious token detection [Blockaid]. \n\nThis tool scans token addresses, providing an additional layer of security against malicious airdropped tokens.\n\n\n\n7. Address labeling [Etherscan]. \n\nThis tool scans token addresses, providing an additional layer of security against malicious airdropped tokens.\n\n\n\n**B.\tBlockchain Forensics Investigator.**\n\nThe forensic investigator works to improve response time and accuracy in the 1inch Network. First, the investigator monitors the DeFi space for news of any emerging threats, leverages online and community resources to identify bad actors, and requests manual blacklisting of bad actors in the 1inch Network in real time. \n\n\n\nSecond, the investigator investigates potential false positives identified by automated tools to determine whether blacklisting is justified by the evidence. Automated tools can and do flag innocent users by mistake. The investigator's efforts decrease the chances that an innocent user is locked out of the Network. \n\n\n\n**Fund Transfer Specification**.\n\nIf this proposal passes, the 1inch Network DAO will transfer $400,000 USDC to pay for 12 months of services.\n\n\n\nThe funds will be transferred from the 1inch DAO primary Treasury Wallet to the following [3 of 5] multi-sig wallet: [0x2CE28D66C10EddA4E251c0b170517281a6363C35] of 1inch Labs to further API offering for compliance needs.\n\n\n\n**Rationale**.\n\nWithout 1inch Security, users of the 1inch Network will be more vulnerable to malicious actors and the 1inch Network's reputation and brand value may suffer. In addition to protecting users, 1inch Security can identify addresses and transactions connected to illicit activities on blockchain networks. As countries continue to build regulatory frameworks around the use of cryptocurrencies, 1inch Network can show itself to be a leader in compliance and security through its use of 1inch Security.\n\n\n\n**About TRM Labs**.\n\nFounded in 2018, TRM Labs is one of the best known names in blockchain intelligence and analysis. TRM's wallet screening API allows customers to analyze data related to an on-chain transaction for AML or sanctions risks. \n\n\n\n**About Blockaid**.\n\nCo-founded by Ido Ben-Natan and Raz Niv, who served together in Israeli Cyber Intelligence, Blockaid came out of stealth in October 2023 with $33M in funding from Ribbit, Variant, Cyberstarts, Sequoia and Greylock. In September 2023, Blockaid-enabled wallets were prevented from signing transactions with hackers that took over Vitalik Buterin's Twitter account. \n\n\n\n**About Blowfish**.\n\nHeadquartered in Switzerland, Blowfish led recipients of global anti-money laundering seed funding in 2022 with $11.8 million from Paradigm and other investors. A team of blockchain industry veterans focuses on transaction security by scanning millions of transactions per week for malware and scams. \n\n\n\n**About Etherscan**.\n\nEtherscan is the leading block explorer and search, API & analytics platform for Ethereum. Built and launched in 2015, Etherscan is one of the earliest and longest-running independent projects built for Ethereum and its community, with the mission of providing equitable access to blockchain data.\n\n\n\n**Considerations**.\n\n1inch Security was configured with the specific tools and providers listed above after considering multiple options. The above tools from TRM Labs, Blockaid, Blowfish and Etherscan were chosen as the optimal bundle of services for the purpose of protecting 1inch Network users, at the most competitive price available. \n\n\n\nOffering a compliance bundle of automated tools alone was also considered. Based on experiences with automated tooling, however, the services of a forensic investigator were determined to be a critical component of an effective compliance layer. There is no substitute for a human being on the ground who can make judgment calls, follow leads, and keep an eye on all the moving and shifting parts of DeFi compliance.",

      "title": "[1IP-56] Launch a crowd and beta testing platform beta.1inch.io Grant Proposal",
      "content": "# Summary\nThis proposal is dedicated to the launch of [beta.1inch.io](https://xcrwd.io) - platform for testing web3 projects aimed to ensure quality of projects and skill growth of participants with rewards for their work. The xcrwd.io team is seeking funding of $150K. Portion of the requested funding is intended to pay for the development, the work of the community manager, and the closure of project needs. Part of the requested amount will be directed to rewards for platform contributors.\n\nThe platform is actually a synergy of 3 main components: the bugtracker, expert web3 QA community and education portal. That’s all directed to help the web3 projects to increase their products quality with the power of beta testing.\n\n# Abstract\nWe are building a crowd and beta testing platform, designed to involve web3 users to actively participate in the testing and release processes. At its core the platform has a powerful bug tracker where users can submit reports. Approved reports are rewarded, recognizing the valuable contributions of our testing community.\n\nWith receiving funding we will be glad to invite 1inch.io as one of the flagship web3 products that will be the first product available for beta-testers that will allow us to set up our platform.\n\nWith your support, we aim to transform the platform into an expert and full-fledged testing community that not only benefits from testers feedback but also actively contributes to the advancement of web3 technology. Platform underscores the principle that all valuable work should be compensated, and we are committed to ensuring that our dedicated testing community is properly rewarded for their contributions. When testers submit reports, they earn points (after report validation) that could be spent for rewards from the showcase.\n\n# Motivation\n[beta.1inch.io](https://xcrwd.io) (by xcrwd team) is a beta and crowd testing platform that addresses a crucial issue in web3 products: the stability and smooth release processes of decentralized applications (dApps). It solves the problem of ensuring that these drops are free from vulnerabilities, bugs, and security flaws. This can be achieved through the platform's provision of a QA community that is skill-confirmed. By involving a global community of testers from experienced web3 users, the platform enhances the overall reliability and quality of web3 projects by utilizing a global community of testers from experienced web users. There is a shortage of web3 QA engineers, but users are already skilled enough to assist projects with testing and releases for rewards.\nThe 1inch (and 1inch DAO), like other web3 protocols, can benefit from xcrwd.io platform in the following ways:\n\n- Enhanced security: by utilizing crowdsourced QA, the 1inch can identify and address bugs of all specter, from UI to smart contracts security;\n- Protocol improvements: feedback and insights from the xcrwd.io community can lead to valuable improvements in the 1inch protocols, making them more user-friendly, secure, and competitive;\n- Motivated beta testers community would help with increasing 1inch products quality and stability;\n- Internal 1inch product teams would get useful and detailed feedback from beta-testers and experts about product issues - structured reports with steps, screenshots/casts, logs and other useful additional information;\n- Stable releases with minimum issues and boost for delivering complex features to users - by beta and crowd testing flow for releases;\n- Crowd testing around the world: user-stories testing, corner cases testing, A/B testing, special tasks for beta-testers to check necessary for 1inch team cases at time, testing on a plenty number of devices, conditions, regions and environments, collecting feedback about features and other cases from community of beta testers, etc…;\n- Community engagement: collaborating with xcrwd.io fosters community engagement and trust. It demonstrates the 1inch commitment to transparency and security, which can attract more users and developers to the ecosystem;\n- Potential refund to DAO in future (after adding new projects to platform);\n- Potential hiring for QA (Dev, etc.) engineers from platform in future;\n\n# Specification\nThe platform will provide the power of crowd and beta testing to web3 products releases and the first one will be the 1inch itself. To do this we will implement the keys features:\n\n- The platform should support user registration through an acceptance testing, web3 authentication, and profile management:\n- Access to platform by “web3” auth: SIWE (https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4361)\n- Smooth acceptance flow: Entrance verification for new users; Users can claim fee tokens only after the probation period.\n- The ability to create, manage, and provide testing products to testers;\n- A built-in bug tracking system to report, track, and manage issues found during testing.\n- The claim contract to issue tokens for paying fee during tests based on 1inch merkle-distribution set of contracts (https://github.com/1inch/merkle-distribution);\n- The showcase where testers can spend earned points for rewards;\n- The space for communication and collaboration among testers and moderators;\n- To avoid abuse users will lose access to the platform if there are abusive actions or no activity;\n- In future we will add an NDA procedure for experts QA who would receive early-access to inner products and features;\n- Also in future we will add ERC-5192 (https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-5192) SBT expert verification;\n\nLooking ahead, we envision the implementation of SBT (ERC-5192) as a means to further empower our users. These tokens will serve as a digital badge of honor, containing records of successful bug reports and showcasing their growing QA skills. This innovative approach not only encourages active participation but also helps users build a portfolio of expertise within the web3 space.\n\n## Team\nTo date, the xcrwd.io core team includes:\n- Danya (founder, pm, front-end): 8+ years as QA Engineer (fullstack); Worked in fields as UGC, social networks, e-commerce, O2O, telecom, foodtech, streaming and now web3; strong experience in developing and optimizing teamwork processes, and setting up release management; experience of leadership in small QA and dev teams; mentoring and educating interns and new employees. https://www.linkedin.com/in/xxai\n- Max (smart contracts and backend developer): 3+ years as Blockchain engineer; Solidity, Rust, Node.js, Typescript, Substrate, Soroban; Develop production-ready DeFi products and backend infrastructure; Solo auditor at strongholdsec.io. https://www.linkedin.com/in/max-nabokov-4174221b0\n\nAnd part-time contributors:\n\nFull-stack developer (8+ years as Android & iOS Software Engineer with experience in Backend & Web. 3+ years of experience in management of teams);\nFrontend developer, (ex QA Engineer): 5 years as full-stack QA& AQA, 2 years in web3.\n\n## Roadmap\nFor now we have a demo for bugtracker app, and we are in progress with [app version 1.0](https://app.xcrwd.io) (that includes frontend, backend, auth, smart-contract, etc. for production use).\n\nAlso we are in progress with a [platform landing page](https://xcrwd.io), community space chats and acceptance tests for future contributors (beta-testers), and we are in touch with [cyberacademy.dev](https://cyberacademy.dev) founders and members as a first part of our education platform.\n\nResources:\n- Landing: https://xcrwd.io/\n- Demo: https://demo.xcrwd.io/\n- App (alpha version): https://app.xcrwd.io/\n- Claim smart contract: https://github.com/xcrwd/merkle-distribution\n- Cyberacademy: https://cyberacademy.dev/\n\n### First phase:\nIn general: develop and release v1.0 platform app as beta.1inch.io and start build community till end of Q3 2024\n\n- Development & Release:\nbugtracker, profile, reward shop, achievements & rating system; smart contract for claim native tokens for test (transactions fees); auth (SIWE: EIP-4361); Instruments for publishing education materials from partners (1inch, cyber academy, etc.);\n\n- Acceptance:\nCreate landing with information about platform capabilities; Acceptance tests for platform users; Set up chat & channel for community (telegram/discord); Initiate community building, finding/involvement members (beta-testers); Land first users (beta-testers) to platform;\n\n- BD:\nDeliver and connect platform for 1inch products as a first project for testing;\n\n### Second phase:\nIn general: platform growth\n\n- Development:\nFeatures and stability; Configure infrastructure for scaling - Prepare to add new 1inch products for testing (example 1inch mobile wallet, 1inch Portfolio, etc.)\n\n- Product & Community:\nGather a community of beta testers; Configure/stabilize processes of beta testing; Hire community manager;\n\n## Payment structure & costs\nBreakdown of the costs by groups for the project duration (till end of 2024):\n- First funding for rewards to beta-testers: $20k\n- Platform maintenance: $130k - \nv1 deliver: backend, frontend & smart contract, design: $100k;\nInfrastructure and operational efficiency: $10k;\nCommunity building (community manager, articles, activities, etc.): $20k;\n- **Total**: $150k USDC\n- **Receiving address:** 0x42985e34d66b6FfbB1A8d67646c0b75c53938a4c\n\n# Rationale\nOur research has shown that the majority of bug bounty programs focus on testing smart contracts and reviewing code for security issues, so the problem of zero-bug policies and an unsatisfactory user experience are not a top priority. At this point, platforms have a lot of issues such as: non-intuitive experience for new users, lack of community, unclear calculation of payments and impermanence in contributing for testers or white hackers.\nPlatform’s priorities are to integrate into web3 product release processes, which will result in improved product quality on a regular basis. We aim to educate and transform newbies and IT engineers into experts in web3 QA...\n\nTo access the full proposal, check out the link below.",

Content ranges from introductory talks to in-depth discussions on cutting-edge subjects such as cryptography (Zero-Knowledge Proofs, Multi-Party Computation, Fully Homomorphic Encryption), layer 2 solutions & rollups, and mechanism design. Logistics include all-inclusive meals and accommodations, facilitating an immersive and uninterrupted experience. 0xCastle is crafted not only for educational purposes, it’s also aimed at promoting collaboration across different fields and exploring the fundamentals of blockchain technology.\n\nOur decision to create 0xCastle originates from recognizing a clear need within the blockchain community for more meaningful and effective gatherings. Through our extensive participation in numerous hackathons and community events, we’ve consistently observed a gap in how these events connect participants, share knowledge, and foster innovation. Traditional venues often fall short in facilitating genuine interactions and deep dives into complex topics like blockchain technology. By choosing a unique setting like a castle and leveraging our strong technical expertise and vast network, we’re addressing these shortcomings head-on. We aim to create an environment that not only fosters learning and collaboration but also builds a strong community committed to advancing blockchain technology. Our firsthand experiences and observations have confirmed the demand for such a novel approach, where the focus is on quality interactions, in-depth exploration of topics, and collaborative problem-solving, all within a setting that inspires creativity and teamwork. This is not just about changing the venue, it’s about reimagining what a tech event can be, making 0xCastle a necessary innovation in the blockchain space.\n\nSee our vision and more information about the event on the  [website](https://0xcastle.xyz/)\n\nHave a look at our  [pitch deck](https://pitch.com/v/0xcastle-research-retreat-grant-application-7yt3nq)\n## Rationale\n\n1Inch is an established DeFi platform and has proven to contribute with cutting-edge tech to the ecosystem. 0xCastle is targeting high-profile researchers, developers and blockchain enthusiasts. Our education and research retreat covering pressing topics in Blockchain technology would be significantly enhanced by exploring the 1inch’s tech stack. As one of the driving forces in the DeFi space, 1inch’s advancements would be a good example of recent progress in this field.\n\n1Inch can provide research questions to allow participants to understand the current work in the space. Furthermore, 1inch will receive brand recognition through mentions and branding during the event. The presence of blockchain clubs such as Cambridge Blockchain Society, Cornell Blockchain, Blockchain at Berkeley, TUM Blockchain Club, KRYPTOSPHERE and many more, will offer many opportunities to expand the ecosystem.\n\nOne of our goals is to deepen the interest in DeFi among researchers by exploring the innovative solutions. The aggregation and limit order protocols developed by the 1inch team are some of the examples we would like to showcase. We would love to have 1inch significantly contribute to our DeFi education track and provide input on the events agenda. A talk and/or a workshop covering 1inch’s services, their underlying technology and insights into the latest developments would significantly enhance the value of our event. This will ensure that our discussions are directly relevant and contribute meaningfully to the 1inch ecosystem.\n\n## Considerations\n\nThe event is organized by 0xCollective, TUM Blockchain Club, and Blockchain Acceleration Foundation. Our team has extensive experience in web3, with both academic and professional backgrounds. We’ve graduated from top universities with computer science degrees, specializing in blockchain-related fields. Professionally, we’ve worked at leading blockchain companies like Quantstamp and Staking Facilities, contributing as developers, researchers, and thought leaders. Outside of formal education and careers, we’re actively involved in the web3 community through non-profit organizations, bettering our understanding of both technical and societal aspects of blockchain. Every team member has a solid grasp of web3 technologies, with most excelling in technical development and others knowledgeable in blockchain theory. Have attended countless of hackathons and won many prizes there, web3 conferences and been part of various hands on workshops during those.

      "title": "[1IP-54] Recognized Delegates Program Renewal",
      "content": "**Simple Summary**\nRenew the Recognised Delegates Program for 12 months, by allocating 100,000 USDC. This program promotes community-led governance in 1inchDAO by incentivising active participation and retaining talent.\n\n## Abstract\nInspired by the success of the original RDP, this proposal suggests renewing the Recognized Delegates Program (RDP) by 12 months and funding it with 100,000 USDC. This move will promote further decentralisation and community led governance for the 1inchDAO.\n\n## Motivation\nThe Recognized Delegates program, which was proposed last year, was able to incentivize high-quality delegates to contribute to the governance of the 1inch DAO as well as incentivize new delegates to participate in the governance of the DAO. Inspired by this success, we believe that renewing the current version of the program will continue to create positive change in the management of the 1inchDAO  \n\n## Specification\n**Overview:**\nA recognised delegate is an elected, paid position of reputable, diligent and qualified 1inch DAO members who will work closely with the team and contribute to the growth and sustainability of the 1inchDAO.\n\nRecognized delegates fall into three categories, called ‘Tiers’, based on their performance and voting weight. Irrespective of which tier a delegate belongs to, as long as a delegate fulfils the responsibilities outlined below and gets accepted via a snapshot vote, the delegate shall be considered as a ‘Recognized Delegate’\n\n**Responsibilities:**\n\nRead, understand, and provide feedback if necessary on governance forum posts.\nAlways vote in the best interests of the DAO and the community over their personal interests.\nActively vote on governance proposals and explain the thinking behind each vote when relevant.\nUnderstand the 1inch Network, its key metrics and the overall ecosystem.\nCompensation:\nThis Recognised Delegates Programme aims to attract and retain entities and individuals who will actively participate in governance on behalf of 1INCH token-holders as governance specialists. Hence we suggest compensating the delegates based on minimum participation and performance. \n\nDelegates will be compensated based on the tiers.\n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreicqbd7teykk6m6oysl3duq5zy65vvuxmndewy3okmy5r6x76v3oka)\n    \nCompensation eligibility:\nMinimum Participation: A delegate must maintain at least ‘x’% participation rate. Participation is measured as voting in any “temperature check” or a snapshot governance vote.\n\nMinimum Communication: A delegate must maintain at least ‘y’ % communication rate. Communication is measured as providing for any “temperature check” or a snapshot governance vote, a summary, a voting position, and a justification for that position. A missed vote will still require communication to avoid a lower communication rate.\n\nMinimum Delegation Threshold: To remain eligible for delegate incentives, a delegate must maintain voting weight of at least ‘z’ Unicorn Power (UP)\n\n![image](ipfs://bafkreianyr6keuyqzb3jh3v2ur2vpttespgrezwlvirssvyzijp2a57uuq)\n    \n*above calculations will be made from the time a delegate is accepted as a recognized delegate by the DAO by following the procedure outlined below\n\nProcedure:\nIn order to get accepted as a ‘Recognized delegate’ by following the process below:\n\nPhase 1: Announce your candidacy by filling the Recognized Delegate Application Template [here] and posting it to the Recognized Delegates category of the forum\n\nPhase 2: Contact relevant stakeholder to gather feedback and support\n\nPhase 3: Open a temperature check poll to gauge consensus\n\nPhase 4: Post your proposal on snapshot\n\nRecognized Delegates:\nDAOplomats and StableLab were voted in by the 1inch DAO via governance as tier 3 recognized delegates and will continue in the same position as we advance.\n\nWe suggest that new delegates, Michigan Blockchain, FranklinDAO, and Curia should be upgraded to become tier 1 delegates upon receiving sufficient voting weight in delegation. The DAO should take steps to help these groups reach T1 status\n\n## Rationale\nThis renewal will promote further decentralisation and community led governance for the 1inchDAO by retaining current talent and providing incentives for new delegates to increase their activity.\n\n## Considerations\n\nThe DAO should takes steps in order to speed up the governance process in order to keep delegates engaged in the program\n\nIn terms of budget, we suggest setting aside 100,000 USDC to run this program over 12 months. This budget includes compensation for existing delegates according to their tiers as well as a small buffer for potential new delegates who can join this program",

      "content": "Title\n-----\n\n[Ladder](https://github.com/svanas/ladder) is a free, open source crypto trading bot that automates the strategy of incremental buying or selling of a crypto asset (rather than opting for a single price).\n\nSimple Summary\n--------------\n\nWe will want to add support for [1inch limit orders](https://1inch.io/limit-order-protocol) to the ladder software.\n\nAbstract\n--------\n\nTrading crypto is a game of dealing with harsh volatility and the uncertainties of timing the market. Most traders get it wrong. Throw in human emotions and all you get is anxiety rather than profits.\n\nLadder trading is a strategy to minimize the risks and reap greater rewards. The ladder software automates the strategy while removing human emotions.\n\nAt the time of this writing, Ladder supports CEXes such as Coinbase and Bitstamp and Binance only. We are planning on adding support for DEXes.\n\nMotivation\n----------\n\nWe will want to add support for 1inch limit orders to Ladder. This will allow our users to trade on a DEX while bringing volume to the 1inch network.\n\nSpecification\n-------------\n\nWe will use the 1inch yet-to-be-released [Go SDK](https://github.com/1inch/1inch-sdk/tree/main/golang). We will test-drive this new SDK and open PRs if needed. If things are unclear, we will work with the 1inch developers and fix or document things.\n\nAbout Us\n--------\n\nLadder is developed by [Stefan](https://svanas.github.io/), a (Delphi and Rust and Go) developer and Ethereum consultant. In the past, Stefan worked for Macromedia and Adobe and 1Password. Stefan is the lead dev of a [web3 implementation for the Delphi programming language](https://github.com/svanas/delphereum). You can look at Stefan's other projects [here](https://github.com/svanas).\n\nFunding Request\n---------------\n\nWe believe we need 3 weeks to integrate the 1inch limit order protocol with the ladder crypto trading software and write a nice medium article that explains how to set Ladder up with 1inch.\n\nWe are asking for $6,000 in 1INCH tokens.",

      "title": "[1IP-51] Extend 1inch DAO with EIP-4824",
      "content": "**Author:** [amanwithwings](https://gov.1inch.io/profile/id/121115)\n\n## Simple Summary\n\nAn opportunity to publish an EIP-4824 compliant daoURI for 1inch DAO and join the ranks of Optimism Collective, Arbitrum Foundation, ShapeShift, Snapshot, Aragon, etc. in advancing the interoperability of the DAO ecosystem.\n\n## Abstract\n\n[EIP-4824](https://daostar.one/EIP) defines a standard JSON schema for publishing DAO metadata onchain. If this proposal passes, 1inch DAO will adopt EIP-4824 by deploying a new smart contract on the Ethereum mainnet to store its daoURI. **This proposal does not involve any transfer of funds or changes to 1inch’s existing smart contracts.**\n\nDAOstar, with the support of grants from the Ethereum Foundation, Optimism Collective, Arbitrum Foundation, Gnosis, etc. will assist 1inch DAO in creating its daoURI. Except for gas fees required to deploy a registration contract, the DAO will not have to bear any additional cost or resources to execute this proposal.\n\n## Motivation\n\nToday, there are over 20,000 DAOs ([source](https://deepdao.io/)), deployed using different governance frameworks, many with token holders and treasuries on multiple chains. This number is set to increase by orders of magnitude in the next few years. Additionally, with new layer-2s and cross-chain products, the number of DAO-controlled parameters is increasing day by day.\n\nBut currently, we lack a robust framework to process DAO data. While tooling providers are doing their best, it has become almost impossible to keep up with the DAO ecosystem. A good litmus test of the present situation is to check the amount of manual labor it takes to add/change data on any of the leading aggregators like Messari, DeepDAO, or Boardroom. As a result, new DAOs, DAO frameworks, and novel DAO data fail to be represented by tooling providers.\n\nEIP-4824 was authored to address this shortcoming. The standard has gained significant momentum in the last year in terms of adoption:\n\n1.  Snapshot X, the onchain governance framework from Snapshot Labs has adopted EIP-4824. Going forward, 100s and possibly 1000s of DAOs created using Snapshot X will be automatically EIP-4824 compliant.\n2.  [ShapeShift DAO](https://snapshot.org/#/shapeshiftdao.eth/proposal/0xa0961a1710084fa076d2f774dade6fcede92941d0f12d5c3eac0aaeaa6e6a059), [Unlock Protocol](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/unlock/proposal/88514909609252335816460489315313822288366112768901791852399180053604763902892?chart=2), and [LXDAO](https://daostar.org/registration/optimism:0xb2bc4c8a74c8374ca1cb529bed78572d197ac554) recently adopted EIP-4824.\n3.  Optimism Collective awarded DAOstar a Mission Proposal to ensure EIP-4824 compliance within the Optimism ecosystem. We are currently developing an alternate route to publishing daoURI’s, using Ethereum Attestation Station (EAS).\n4.  The Arbitrum Foundation awarded DAOstar a grant to streamline the adoption of EIP-4824 and the infrastructure being built on top of it. This grant will support an ambitious regulatory interoperability project that leverages EIP-4824 to build a regulatory interface for DAOs.\n\nOn top of this, DAO frameworks including Aragon V3, DAODAO (Cosmos), Moloch v2 / DAOHaus, Moloch v3 / DAOHaus, Gnosis Safe, DAOstack, KALI, Q.org, Power Protocol, and XDAO have either already adopted or have committed to adopting EIP-4824 in the short term.\n\nEIP-4824 has also provided a solid foundation for the [Grants Management Standard](https://github.com/metagov/daostar/discussions/51) piloted by Gitcoin; [Attestations Standard](https://github.com/metagov/daostar/blob/main/DAOIPs/daoip-3.md) authored by Avenue, Govern, EAS & funded by Optimism; and for much of the [Regulatory Interoperability](https://www.notion.so/daostar/Regulatory-Interoperability-WG-Open-Notes-7e32bbe94b574b36b22c121514378a12) working group’s initiatives, proving the importance of a DAO metadata standard.\n\n## Specification\n\nEIP-4824 defines a standard JSON-LD schema to publish DAO metadata onchain:\n\n```\n{\n\n\"@context\": \"http://www.daostar.org/schemas\",\n\n\"type\": \"DAO\",\n\n\"name\": \"<name of the DAO>\",\n\n\"description\": \"<description>\",\n\n\"membersURI\": \"<URI>\",\n\n\"proposalsURI\": \"<URI>\",\n\n\"activityLogURI\": \"<URI>\",\n\n\"governanceURI\": \"<URI>\",\n\n\"contractsRegistryURI\": \"<URI>\"\n\n}\n```\nA daoURI is simply a link that points to information on 1inch DAO, compliant with the above-defined schema. We make the following suggestions regarding subfields:\n\nname: 1inch DAO\n\ndescription: The 1inch Network (https://1inch.io/) unites decentralized protocols whose synergy enables the most lucrative, fastest, and protected operations in the DeFi space by offering access to hundreds of liquidity sources across multiple chains. Currently, its product offerings include the 1inch dApp, 1inch Aggregation Protocol, 1inch Liquidity Protocol, 1inch Limit Order Protocol, P2P Transactions, and the 1inch Mobile Wallet. The 1inch Network is composed of three distinct groups of stakeholders: the 1inch Foundation, the 1inch core contributors, and the 1inch DAO. Voting on the DAO is through the 1INCH token, a governance token, that was initially distributed to the community of 1inch Network users in late 2020. The 1inch DAO has control, among others, over liquidity protocol instant governance; aggregation protocol instant governance; 1INCH token; 1inch Network revenue stream; and 1inch Network DAO Treasury.\n\nmembersURI (uses Boardroon’s API): [https://services.daostar.org/api/v1/boardroom/members/1/1inch](https://services.daostar.org/api/v1/boardroom/members/1/1inch)\n\nproposalsURI (uses Snapshot API): [https://services.daostar.org/api/v1/snapshot/proposals/1inch.eth](https://services.daostar.org/api/v1/snapshot/proposals/1inch.eth)\n\nHere is a sample daoURI based on the above suggestions: ipfs://QmQMFqk15EPz4ot5vR8RW3K24t14fb4Aj9G1pujwnoBYXA\n\nDAOstar can help customize any of the subURIs or add any additional data that the 1inch community may be interested in including in its daoURI. We specifically invite comments and feedback from the broader community on this. The DAOstar [register page](https://daostar.org/register) provides a simple interface to generate a daoURI. daoURIs hence generated are automatically stored to IPFS.\n\n### Execution\n\nIf passed, 1inch DAO will execute the following call to the EIP-4824 Registration Factory (0x2Dac5DBbF1D024c1E0D9c92D3AeDa7618e15aDd7) on Ethereum Mainnet to complete the registration, setting the [1inch DAO treasury multi-sig](https://app.safe.global/balances?safe=eth:0x7951c7ef839e26F63DA87a42C9a87986507f1c07) contract as its admin:\n\nCall EIP4824RegistrationSummoner.summonRegistration(salt, daoURI, manager, contracts, data)\n\nNew clones are deployed to predictable addresses using the message sender and a bytes32 value combined as a salt.\n\nDuring registration, an additional manager can be set, possibly delegating the responsibility to a working group within the DAO or DAOstar. Setting a manager ensures that daoURI updates do not need to go through governance every single time. It can also be left blank (set to 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000) and managers can be added/removed later as needed. Managers can update daoURIs but do not have permission to add new managers or admins. We foresee daoURI updates to be infrequent.\n\nTo set more than one manager or admins (for example, the DAO treasury and a DAO working group as admins, and DAOstar as a manager), the DAO needs to make an additional transaction after the registration contract is deployed.\n\n### Roles & Access Control\n\nUpon deployment, the registration contract is initialized with a DAO address and an optional manager address. The DAO address should be the contract that can execute arbitrary onchain transactions as instructed by the DAO members through the governance process. For 1inch DAO, this is the DAO treasury multi-sig on mainnet at 0x7951c7ef839e26F63DA87a42C9a87986507f1c07.\n\nAdmin role is granted to the DAO address on initialization. This role allows the address to grant and revoke roles.\n\nAn additional Manager is set by the initialization function. This role allows the address to update the DAO URI but not to modify roles.\n\n### Simulation Results\n\nGiven a salt of 0x9729472110010000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 and a msg.sender of the 1inch DAO treasury multi-sig (eth:0x7951c7ef839e26F63DA87a42C9a87986507f1c07), the registration contract is deployed to 0xea38b005a0b1fdd4293d98c99c26593e81bbfbd1\n\nAs additional references, please refer to:\n\n1.

EIP-4824 adoption by [Unlock DAO](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/unlock/proposal/88514909609252335816460489315313822288366112768901791852399180053604763902892?chart=2) using Tally/Governor.\n\n## Rationale\n\n***\n*Information regarding the proposal rationale can be seen in the original forum post. It was pruned from this proposal to stay within the Snapshot 10,000 character limit.*\n***\n\n## Considerations and Summary\n\nIn summary, this is an extremely low-risk proposal that’ll take us one step closer to true interoperability within the DAO ecosystem. This proposal does not involve any transfer of funds or changes to 1inch’s smart contracts. It also does not require additional expenditure of resources from 1inch DAO. DAOstar stands to provide all assistance necessary to smoothen the adoption of EIP-4824.\n\nGiven the importance of standards and the improvements they bring to the web3 ecosystem, we urge everyone to provide their feedback on this proposal.",

      "title": "[1IP-50] 1inch alternative swap interface",
      "content": "**Author:** [Denis](https://gov.1inch.io/profile/id/130975)\n\n## Simple Summary\n\nIt is proposed to create an alternative open-source version of the 1inch swap interface.\n\n## Abstract\n\nThe alternative exchange interface will implement the same functions as the main 1inch exchange interface, but being an open source product, which allows each community member to make changes and put forward suggestions for improving the product\n\n## Motivation\n\nCreation of an alternative version of the interface in the development of which every community member can participate\n\n## Specification\n\nThe main technical task at the moment is to implement an interface that allows creating Fusion Swap Order and Limit Order based on token prices from open onchain or subgraph sources, such as Uniswap v2, v3, SushiSwap, PancakeSwap, and others.\n\nFor the technical implementation, Angular 17 (the current version at this moment) will be used, utilizing the new signal approach in this framework. The viem library will be used for onchain interaction.\n\nAlso, it is necessary to create a desktop version of the swap interface. For this purpose, an Electron wrapper (or similar technologies) and a distribution system through GitHub Releases will be used.\n\nRationale\n\nFor the implementation of the application, I chose from the three most popular solutions for web applications at the moment: React.js, Angular, and Vue.js. The main criteria for selection were:\n\n-   Developers' experience working with these solutions.\n-   Flexibility of the solutions.\n-   The completeness of features 'out of the box'.\n-   Support for TypeScript.\n\nBased on these criteria, I settled on Angular as this framework is my main tool. Currently, the Angular development team greatly facilitates the process of working with the framework, making it more flexible and adaptable. This framework provides a full range of solutions for implementing complete web applications, and importantly, TypeScript is native to Angular.\n\nViem was chosen as the most modern and lightweight implementation of the onchain middleware. It is well-suited for tree shaking and has very strict TypeScript support.\n\n## Considerations\n\nAlthough the main goal of the application is to fully transition to an onchain work system and to move away from various APIs, at this stage, we cannot completely abandon the use of external APIs. The only essential API, without which the application cannot function, is the API for sending fusion orders. To interact with this API, the 1inch Dev Portal will be used. Since the 1inch Dev Portal requires authorization and its security policies do not allow working with the API through web applications, setting up and maintaining a proxy is required. In turn, a completely open and unprotected proxy will become a kind of backdoor for anyone who wants to use it. This implies the need for setting up CORS policies and various security measures such as a Web Application Firewall.\n\n## Costs\n\n**Lead Developer:** The team leader's responsibilities include creating the basic framework of the application, establishing and maintaining contribution rules for the community, writing application code, writing unit tests.\n\nCost for 12 months: $72000\n\n**Part-time UI/UX Designer:** The designer's responsibilities include developing a design that differs from the main 1inch design and creating a unique style for the application\n\nCost for 12 months: $1000\n\n**Total**: $73000\n\nReceiving Address\n\nFor funding the project, the following address is proposed: 0x568D3086f5377e59BF2Ef77bd1051486b581b214.\n\nGitHub repository: [https://github.com/1inch-community/interface](https://github.com/1inch-community/interface)",

      "content": "**Author**: [STORM Partners](https://gov.1inch.io/profile/id/127476)\n\n\n## Simple Summary\n\n  \n\nProposed services will provide 1inch DAO with comprehensive legal support to face the many challenges its decentralised nature poses. Our team will cover, among others, cross-jurisdiction regulatory compliance, contractual agreements, DAO governance framework, members' liability, legal personality, asset protection, intellectual property, enforcement of rights and defence against external claims. Our legal representation, underpinned by community-guided Power of Attorney, is meant to ensure the DAO's stability, efficiency and longevity.\n\n## Abstract\n\n1inch DAO, like other decentralised organisations, encounters intricate legal challenges, necessitating legal assistance to navigate regulatory risks, protect stakeholder interests, and maintain operational resilience.\n\n  \n\nThis proposal outlines the integration of comprehensive legal and compliance services provided by STORM Partners within 1inch DAO. It encompasses regulatory compliance checks, entity structuring, governance policy development, contractual support, IP protection, and legal defence against external claims.\n\n  \n\nMoreover, the Power of Attorney is introduced to authorise STORM Partners to act on behalf of 1inch DAO in legal matters while remaining subject to the community's guidance. These measures aim to enhance safety, streamline governance processes, and foster operational efficiency, fortifying the DAO's foundations and protecting the interests of its stakeholders. \n\n## Motivation\n\n\nLegal uncertainty and ambiguity are the most significant threats to the future of DAOs. We aim to assist 1inch DAO in establishing a strong and legally sound structure to support its growth and ensure its long-term existence. Issues such as the personal liability of DAO members, the challenges of enforcing contractual rights and defending against third-party claims, the absence of a recognised legal personality, and the risky consequences of non-compliance with regulatory requirements in multiple jurisdictions only scratch the surface of the problem.\n\n  \n\nRecognising that DAOs do not exist outside the legal system is crucial. Recent court cases in the United States and Europe have clearly shown the courts' tendency to apply traditional legal principles regarding corporate liability and regulatory obligations to decentralised entities.\n\n  \n\nWhile some may consider complete anonymity as a means to avoid adverse legal consequences, this approach may be suitable for those who choose to reside in the metaverse. However, an organisation with ambitions to shape the future of finance and empower individuals to take control of their wealth must confront and address its legal challenges.\n\n  \n\nThe importance of legal assistance for 1inch DAO cannot be overstated, as it faces multifaceted dangers in its mission to disrupt traditional socio-economic paradigms:\n\n  \n\n-   **Regulatory Risks:** DAOs operate in a legally uncertain environment. They can inadvertently breach complex regulations, leading to penalties, fines, or even legal actions.\n\n  \n\n-   **Liability Concerns:** Without proper legal guidance, DAO members may find themselves personally liable for the actions or debts of the organisation, putting their assets at risk.\n\n  \n\n-   **Contractual Ambiguities:** DAOs frequently engage in smart contracts and agreements. Legal expertise is essential to ensure these contracts are enforceable and that the DAO's interests are safeguarded.\n\n  \n\n-   **Recognition as Legal Entities:** Establishing legal recognition is crucial for a DAO to enter into contracts, own assets, and protect members' rights. This often requires navigating intricate legal processes.\n\n  \n\n-   **Enforcement of Rights:** In disputes or claims, a DAO must be able to enforce its rights effectively. Legal counsel can provide strategies and representation to ensure just outcomes.\n\n  \n\n-   **Complex Governance:** DAOs' decentralised governance structures need clear legal foundations to prevent disputes, uphold community decisions, and maintain order.\n\n  \n\nSTORM Partners is the ideal collaborator for 1Inch DAO, thanks to its Web3-exclusive focus, tailored approach, and comprehensive legal services, providing a distinct advantage in navigating the complex and ever-evolving Web3 regulatory landscape.\n\n  \n\nSeeking professional legal guidance is imperative to mitigate these risks, ensuring that 1inch DAO can continue its mission of reshaping the socio-economic landscape while protecting its members and assets in a rapidly evolving Web3 environment.\n\n  \n\n## Specification\n\n  \n\nThe purpose of this engagement is to provide 1inch DAO with legal advisory services to support their activities and give effect to the resolutions passed by the community on [https://snapshot.org/#/1inch.eth](https://snapshot.org/#/1inch.eth).\n\n  \n\nThe engagement between 1inch DAO and STORM Partners will encompass a range of legal and compliance services, with detailed specifications as follows:\n\n  \n\n-   **Legal and Regulatory Compliance Advisory:** Advice on legal and regulatory matters to mitigate risks and potential liabilities arising out of the activities of 1inch DAO in multiple jurisdictions.\n\n  \n\n-   **Contractual Support:** Draft, review and manage all contractual agreements that are necessary to ensure the protection of the rights and interests of 1inch DAO within the context of its day-to-day operations.\n\n  \n\n-   **Legal Defence:** Defend the rights and interests of 1inch DAO against any claims made by external public authorities or private parties.\n\n  \n\n-   **Enforcement of Contracts and Dispute Resolution:** Assist 1inch DAO in enforcing their contractual rights and support in resolving legal disputes.\n\n  \n\n-   **Corporate Services:** Support with the incorporation and administration of legal entities (companies and foundations) in selected onshore and offshore jurisdictions.\n\n  \n\n-   **DAO Governance Framework:** Draft internal governance rules and policies in accordance with the decisions of the community to ensure sound, transparent and fair decision-making processes within the DAO.\n\n  \n\n-   **AML/CFT Compliance:** Conduct KYC/KYB verifications, wallet screening, and transaction monitoring to ensure compliance with international AML/CFT standards and applicable laws.\n\n  \n\n-   **Privacy and Data Protection:** Assist in establishing sound data protection policies and frameworks to comply with GDPR and other relevant privacy regulations.\n\n  \n\n-  ** IP Protection:** Support in protecting intellectual property by registering trademarks, patents and copyrights, drafting licensing frameworks for open-source code, and defending against illegitimate exploitation of proprietary rights.\n\n  \n\n-   **Legal Representation towards third parties:** Represent 1inch DAO as attorney-in-fact towards third parties to execute all necessary acts which may be required to make the decisions taken by the community effective.\n\n  \n\n## Rationale\n\n  \n\nThe decision to engage STORM Partners for legal advisory services and grant a Power of Attorney to this trusted partner is rooted in the critical need to address significant operational challenges that currently hinder the development of the 1inch DAO. The rationale behind these design decisions is as follows:\n\n  \n\n-   **Preserving Decentralisation and Autonomy:** 1inch DAO embodies the ideals of decentralisation and autonomy, which are fundamental to its mission. These principles are of paramount importance, but they do not preclude the necessity of navigating complex legal and regulatory landscapes. Engaging STORM Partners allows the DAO to resolve operational issues without compromising its decentralised and autonomous nature.\n\n  \n\n-   **Effective Problem Resolution:** Operational challenges, such as regulatory compliance, contractual disputes, or liability concerns, can obstruct the seamless development and operation of the project. STORM Partners' expertise in legal matters equips 1inch DAO with the capability to address these challenges effectively. This proactive approach mitigates risks and facilitates operational efficiency.\n\n  \n\n-   **Enhanced Legal and Regulatory Compliance:** Engaging a specialised partner like STORM Partners ensures that 1inch DAO remains in adherence to evolving legal requirements, reducing the risk of legal entanglements and liabilities. Foresighted legal advice enables 1inch DAO to anticipate regulations and their effects. This results in a substantial gain in value, as operational staff can take the upcoming legal developments into account to make in advance the best strategic decision.\n\n  \n\n-   **Robust Legal Representation:** By granting a Power of Attorney, the DAO secures robust legal representation in external matters. This empowers 1inch DAO to protect its interests, defend against claims, and engage in legal discussions with third parties on equal footing.\n\n  \n\n-   **Alternate Designs Considered:** Alternative approaches, such as internal legal teams or ad-hoc legal consultations, were considered. However, these approaches often lack the specialised expertise and continuous commitment that STORM Partners brings to the table. Internal teams may also divert resources from the DAO's core mission, while ad-hoc consultations might not offer the level of comprehensive legal support required.\n\n  \n\nIn summary, the decision to engage STORM Partners and grant a Power of Attorney to this trusted partner is the result of a deliberate effort to strike a balance between preserving decentralisation and addressing operational challenges. It is designed to ensure 1inch DAO's legal and regulatory compliance while empowering it with robust legal representation, ultimately benefiting the DAO's development and its commitment to its core principles.\n\n  \n\n## Considerations\n\n  \n\n#### Engagement:\n\n  \n\nThe community's approval of this proposal signifies its consent to engage STORM Partners for the performance of legal advisory services.

      "content": "**Author:** [Natalia](https://gov.1inch.io/profile/id/115612)\n\n# Simple Summary\n\nThis proposal seeks funding from the 1inch DAO for the purchase of comprehensive and dynamic support services, specifically tailored to help grow the 1inch Network ecosystem. The service proposal is designed to enhance 1inch Network customers' experiences and elevate the brand through top-tier Support services.\n\n\n\n\n\n# Abstract\n\nThe proposed Support services will be delivered in 6 service packages: \n\n1) Issue management & reporting across multiple communication channels;\n\n2) Documentation management through the maintenance of Help Center and  Educational Resources;\n\n3) Monitoring Reviews on Wallet App, Trustpilot and App Store;\n\n4) Special Investigation for complex refund cases;\n\n5) Support of the token listing and delisting process; \n\n6) Participating in yearly conferences sponsored by the 1inch Network and managing the branded booth.\n\n\n\nThe 12-month subscription fee for the above 5 service packages is approximately $890,000.00 USDC. The full annual subscription fee is to be paid starting at the 1st of the month immediately following the passing of this proposal.\n\n\n\n**Total Grant Value: $890,000.00 USDC.**\n\n\n\n\n\n# Motivation\n\n1inch Network products and services deliver significant benefits to users on their path to self custody.

This will help 1inch Network gather valuable insights into your users' experiences and proactively address any issues to maintain a positive online reputation.\n\n\n\n- [ ] Special Investigation for complex refund cases  \n\n- [ ] $140,000 per year\n\n\n\nThis service package is dedicated to the management of complex matters such as blockchain exploration and detailed refund cases. Our expert team is here to provide specialized expertise, ensuring comprehensive and rapid solutions while interacting with the 1inch Network development team.\n\n\n\n- [ ] Support of the token listing and delisting process\n\n- [ ] $80,000 per year\n\n\n\nThis service package handles the complexities of token listing and delisting, ensuring compliance with all relevant regulations and a smooth process.\n\n\n\n**Service Package Summary (12 months): $890,000.00 USDC**\n\n\n\n\n\n## Fund Transfer Specification\n\nIf this proposal passes, the 1inch Network DAO will transfer just over $890,000.00 USDC to pay for rendered services over the next 12 months.\n\n\nThe funds will be transferred from [the 1inch DAO primary Treasury Wallet](https://app.safe.global/balances?safe=eth:0x7951c7ef839e26F63DA87a42C9a87986507f1c07) to the following 3 of 5 multi-sig wallet (controlled by the Support team): **0xDE03Fc449Db249DCBC3a795AD72851Be8739B724**\n\n\n\n\n\n# Rationale\n\nIn designing the support services outlined in this proposal, our primary motivation was to create a robust and comprehensive customer support system that directly aligns with the needs of the 1inch Network ecosystem and its users. Several alternative designs and structures were considered, including various configurations of support packages and levels of service. However, the proposed five service packages were chosen as they collectively address the key areas essential to elevating user experience and bolstering the 1inch Network brand.\n\n\n\n\n\n# Considerations\n\nWithout these support services, the 1inch Network will face challenges in customer satisfaction, potentially affecting user retention and network growth. A lack of comprehensive support could lead to unresolved customer issues, negatively impacting the 1inch Network's reputation and brand value. The absence of specialized services like the bug-bounty program management and participation in conferences could also slow down the continuous evolution and improvement of 1inch Network protocols and technical documentation.",

      "title": "Commission Quarterly Research Reports with Messari Protocol Services",
      "content": "Author: Corey Duzy\n\n## Simple Summary\n\nThis proposal seeks funding for the 1inch Network to order (4) quarterly analytical reports from [Messari](https://messari.io/) for Q3-Q4’2023 & Q1-Q2’2024. Total funding value: 80,000 USDC.\n\n## Abstract\n\nWe propose that Messari continues to provide research and reporting services for 1inch in the form of quarterly reports. [Messari](https://messari.io/) is one of the most influential and respected research providers in the crypto space. One of their services is providing crypto projects with long-form research, standardized financial reporting and a platform to get important fundamental information into the hands of the broader crypto community.\n\n## Motivation\n\nThe 1inch Network has ongoing, long-term cooperation with Messari. Messari has already released five quarterly reports for 1inch in 2022-2023:\n\n- https://messari.io/report/state-of-1inch-q2-2022\n- https://messari.io/report/state-of-1inch-q3-2022\n- https://messari.io/report/state-of-1inch-q4-2022\n- https://messari.io/report/state-of-1inch-q1-2023\n- https://messari.io/report/state-of-1inch-q2-2023\n\nThese reports are significantly helpful for members of the 1inch community and the project’s investors in terms of validation of achievements, milestones and various statistical data related to the 1inch Network’s activities. \n\n## Specification\n\nMessari brings transparency to the crypto economy. They want to help investors, regulators and the public to make sense of this revolutionary new asset class. For this purpose, the Messari team keeps building data tools that will drive informed decision making and investment. They believe that crypto will democratize access to information, break down data silos, and ultimately give everyone the tools to build wealth.\n\nEach Messari quarterly report includes:\n\n- **Protocol Income Statements**. Important metrics and key performance indicators are compiled and presented to provide a clear look at project’s fundamentals to view across time periods.\n- **Deep Quantitative Analysis**. Quantitative metrics are assessed on a macro level as well on a micro level, digging deep into the numbers to provide actionable insights.\n- **Real-time Data Dashboards**. Live dashboards are made to highlight all the data available in the report.\n- **Key Events Summaries**. Important events, such as network upgrades and governance proposals are presented to provide a full scope of the project’s latest development.\n\nMessari reports have a unique distribution network:\n\n- **Newsletter**. With over 350,000  subscribers, Messari Unqualified Opinions is among the most read crypto newsletters in the world.\n- **Messari Site & Distribution Partners**. Over 500 top crypto firms and institutions use Messari Daily. Messari reports are also distributed via their own API.\n- **Social Channels**. With 320,000+ followers and over 50 million impressions per month, [@MessariCrypto](https://twitter.com/MessariCrypto) is one of the leading brands on crypto Twitter.\n- **Messari Third Party Partners**. Bloomberg, S&P Capital, and Refinitiv.\n\n## Rationale\n\n### Surfacing on-chain metrics and key developments \n\nThese reports better inform existing stakeholders through recurring, data-driven research from trusted, independent analysts. The actionable insights generated from these reports will better educate them on the economic, financial, and social health of 1inch, whether it’s a surge in trading volume across a certain market or the implications of a major upgrade or governance decision. There are compounding effects to this as various stakeholders are able to leverage our work to further their goals.\n \nExample - [Gauntlet](https://twitter.com/gauntlet_xyz/status/1664310367718350848?s=20) using our assessment of interest rate optimizations on protocol revenue to further quantify the impact.\n\n### Facilitate protocol business development\n\nThis information gets sent out to over 350,000 of our subscribers of which ⅓ comprises most of the top crypto native builders in the space. By getting high-quality information around 1inch’s mechanics and real traction, it increases the likelihood of more projects building on and integrating with 1inch.\n\nWe’ve seen our reporting frequently end up on major DAO governance forums (deploying Uniswap on [Filecoin](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/deploy-uniswap-v3-on-filecoin-virtual-machine-fvm/21309) VM and [Avalanche](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/deploy-uniswap-v3-on-avalanche/20587)) \n\n![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/sOBwdV7AlU78tAH6CqT0fTf5VBQqzPNVzhpZ7GaVJinLad67xOGtnNV0-xNpjXKvHZhQOs7Hbey8Mgs94m2GQrfOWRqgW6WBPh8bv7y8dN26DYeJTEHmXSWcqeXxvcGh8oXIFARm1TJqKBEyLU32OjA)\n\n### Institutional adoption\n\nExisting mainstream coverage of crypto is woefully lacking. Investment banking and sell-side equity research coverage of crypto fails to paint an accurate picture of the material developments in this industry. When it comes to DeFi and even more nuanced aspects of this industry, things only get worse.\n\nTo combat this we have spent significant resources getting onboarded to many of the largest traditional research platforms in the world, including the Bloomberg Terminal, S&P Capital IQ, and Refinitiv. This goes a long way to further professionalize the projects we work with to the vast majority of major funds, banks, financial service companies, and large corporations in the world. After reading these reports, these entities will better grasp the magnitude of economic activity generated by the protocol.\n\nThere are trillions of dollars in AUM represented by the consumers of these platforms, so even a small percentage of users consuming this information and acting on it can drive meaningful activity on-chain.\n\n### Distribution numbers\n\n![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/6vp2jXElN3T7FHYNwV2Dz8jkrAvuVlhAcwVgwVYZEXbCbXBxLYNnZUgL3ofhdG46qw9qf389dtsTKUPbwGCd7FKm7H8Z6jCk9YzJ1iGE4A0gj1DW_GH2RHEqFZzY7Q2VVAD4D2b1pI_FmbvIjE7lJ1Q)\n\n- Bloomberg Terminal: \n    - 325,000 users\n- S&P Global Capital IQ\n    - 12,000 enterprises\n- Refinitiv \n    - 400,000 users\n \nAdditional stats*\n\n- 5 asset managers >$100b\n- 10 asset managers >$1b\n- 5 hedge funds >$50b\n- 11 hedge funds >$1b\n- Aggregate AUM: $5.5 trillion\n- 12 large corporates \n- Market cap: $750b\n\n*numbers are only from Refinitiv as we’re working with Bloomberg and S&P to get more distribution stats.\n\n### Commitment to transparency\n\nFunding this type of reporting demonstrates a proactive commitment by 1inch to transparency and accountability, two core tenets of this industry. Doing so sends positive signals to prospective users, clients, and partners. Additionally, our work with regulators in DC has made it clear that this type of transparency is looked upon favorably and highlights decentralization by working with third-party service providers to execute crucial functions. \n\n## Considerations\n\nThe 1inch DAO should consider validating the 1inch Network metrics and results by a third party organization for another level of transparency. We suggest ordering these reports through Q2 2024.\n\n## Cost\n\nTotal funding value: 80,000 USDC (20,000 USDC for each report).\n\n## Research\n\nOur analysts spend several weeks researching and writing each report, along with an extensive internal editing and review process by the broader team. \n\n## Data Science and Engineering \n\nEach report will have its own dedicated data science and engineering resources tasked with providing all the relevant raw data. This requires ingesting large amounts of data which is housed in a data warehouse, incurring storage and compute costs. \n\n## Distribution\n\nWe have several members of the team working on distribution for these reports across all of Messari’s channels along with the third-party partners.",

      "content": "# Simple Summary\n\n\n\n* Swap all 2,575,405 $ARB tokens in the 1inch DAO Arbitrum treasury for USDC\n* Bridge the USDC to the 1inch DAO treasury on Ethereum mainnet\n\n\n# Abstract\n\nThe 1inch DAO treasury on Arbitrum received an airdrop of 2,575,405 $ARB tokens in April of 2023. This proposal calls for swapping all $ARB tokens for USDC on Arbitrum One, then bridging those USDC funds to the 1inch DAO treasury on Ethereum mainnet.\n\n\n# Motivation\n\nThe primary motivation behind this 1IP is to maximize the value from the received $ARB tokens. By swapping them for USDC, a dollar-pegged stablecoin, we can put those funds to work to grow the 1inch Network. This action strengthens the long-term financial positioning of 1inch by reducing our exposure to volatile assets.\n\n\n# Specification\n\nThis is a signaling proposal as the 1inch DAO Treasury on Arbitrum is managed by a 7-of-12 multisig – all transactions specified herein shall be manually executed.\n\n\n### Transactions\n\n\n\n* 2,575,405 ARB tokens held in the 1inch DAO Treasury on Arbitrum shall be sent to an EOA controlled by 1inch Labs\n* The 1inch Labs EOA shall swap all $ARB tokens for bridged USDC (USDC.e) using one or more of 1inch's swap protocols or other ways of swapping that would incur smaller slippage depending on the market situation.  \n* The 1inch Labs EOA shall bridge all USDC.e funds from Arbitrum to the same EOA on Ethereum mainnet using one of the trustworthy bridges available. \n* Once the bridge process is finalized, the 1inch Labs EOA shall send all USDC to the 1inch DAO Treasury on Ethereum mainnet\n\n\n### Addresses \n\n\n\n* 1inch DAO Treasury Ethereum Mainnet – [eth:0x7951c7ef839e26F63DA87a42C9a87986507f1c07](https://app.safe.global/balances?safe=eth:0x7951c7ef839e26F63DA87a42C9a87986507f1c07)\n* 1inch DAO Treasury Arbitrum One – [arb1:0x71890aC6209Fae61E9D66691c47B168B8300a7c5 ](https://app.safe.global/balances?safe=arb1:0x71890aC6209Fae61E9D66691c47B168B8300a7c5)\n* 1inch Labs EOA (Ethereum & Arbitrum One) – [0x00449963C9E6589eb88a5566fa0877871F3E568A](https://etherscan.io/address/0x00449963C9E6589eb88a5566fa0877871F3E568A)\n* USDC.e –[ arb1:0xff970a61a04b1ca14834a43f5de4533ebddb5cc8 ](https://arbiscan.io/token/0xff970a61a04b1ca14834a43f5de4533ebddb5cc8)\n\n\n# Rationale\n\nChoosing USDC over simply holding $ARB tokens reduces the financial risks associated with holding volatile assets. Best efforts should be given to get the best swap rates for such a large amount so that the trade can be executed with minimal slippage\n\nSubsequently, bridging these assets to Ethereum mainnet allows the funds to be controlled directly via 1inch DAO governance using Snapshot's reality.eth module.\n\n\n# Considerations\n\nAll DeFi transactions contain potential costs and risks that should be taken into account. These include transaction fees, bridge fees, or any slippage costs during the swap process. Potential bridge service security risks should also be assessed.",

      "title": "[1IP-43] Optimizing Fusion Mode: Smart Contract-Enforced Gas Fee Limit and Lowered Unicorn Power Threshold (re-run)",
      "content": "****\nThe initial proposal was missing a necessary onchain transaction to implement the decrease the UP requirement for Resolvers. [Detailed explanation here](https://gov.1inch.io/discussion/13404-1ip43-optimizing-fusion-mode-smart-contractenforced-gas-fee-limit-and-lowered-unicorn-power-threshold?comment=68661).\n\n\n****\n## Simple Summary\n\n- Enforce an Ethereum gas fee limit in the 1inch Fusion mode smart contracts, setting a priorityFee cap based on the block’s baseFee.\n\n- Implement a penalty system, in which violators are barred from filling Fusion mode orders. \n\n- Reduce the Unicorn Power (UP) requirement for Resolvers from 10% to 5%.\n\n\n\n## Abstract\n\nThe proposal aims to both decrease operational costs for Fusion Mode Resolvers and encourage broader participation by introducing a smart contract-enforced priority gas fee limit and a penalty system. Furthermore, by lowering the UP requirement for Resolvers, the Fusion Mode ecosystem will be more accessible.\n\n\n\n## Motivation\n\nCurrently, Resolvers face discouragingly high operational expenses, primarily due to inflated gas fees during auctions. This issue is exacerbated due to resolvers competing with each other, leading to \"resolver gas wars\". The costs of these wars are ultimately borne by participants in the 1inch Network, either through resolvers making smaller profits on filling orders or Fusion Mode users getting worse rates on their trades. \n\n\n\nIn addition, new resolvers are deterred by the high UP requirement for participation. These proposed changes directly address these issues by regulating gas costs and reducing entry thresholds.\n\n\n\n## Specification \n\n\n\n1. **Smart Contract-enforced maximum gas fee:** Implement a rule on the 1inch Fusion mode smart contracts that caps priority gas fees. All attempts to circumvent this restriction, including direct payment to a block builder’s coinbase, will result in a violation. Violations of this limit should trigger the enforcement of penalties.\n\n   - For blocks with baseFee <10.6 gwei – the priorityFee is capped at 70% of the baseFee. \n\n   - For blocks with baseFee between 10.6 gwei and 104.1 gwei – the priorityFee is capped at 50% of the baseFee.\n\n   - For blocks with baseFee >104.1 gwei – priorityFee is capped at 65% of the block’s baseFee. \n\n\n\n2. **Penalty mechanism:** Offending resolvers will be barred from filling Fusion mode orders. \n\n   - First offense – official warning\n\n   - Second offense – one (1) day block from filling orders\n\n   - Third offense – seven (7) day block from filling orders\n\n   - Fourth offense – thirty (30) day block from filling orders\n\n   - Fifth offense – three-hundred sixty-five (365) day block from filling orders\n\n\n\n3. **Decrease in UP threshold:** Propose to lower the UP requirement for Resolvers from 10% to 5% via an alteration in the DAO's governance smart contract.\n\n\n\n**Implementation**:\n\n- If successfully passed, this proposal will be implemented on October 16th.\n\n- This proposal signals to the 1inch Foundation and 1inch Labs to implement this proposal:\n\n   - 1inch Labs should deploy the changes described in this proposal\n\n   - 1inch Foundation should change the public [Fusion Mode Terms of Use for Resolvers](https://docs.1inch.io/assets/files/1inch-Network-Fusion-Swap-Terms-of-Use-for-Resolvers-434356011a6f99d6de8cb3774b615f47.pdf) and communicate these changes with Resolvers\n\n   - The 1inch Foundation should help enforce the penalties described in this proposal\n\n\n\n## Rationale\n\nRestricting the priority gas fee protects resolvers from excessive operational costs, thus maintaining long-term sustainability. The baseFee ranges described in the specification section are based on [historical data](https://dune.com/queries/3038247/5054333) and aim to allow 99.99% of transactions to get included within 15 blocks.\n\n\n\nA penalty mechanism reinforces compliance amongst the participants while preserving fair competition. \n\n\n\nLowering the UP requirement expands the number of resolvers, promoting diversity and robustness in the Fusion Mode ecosystem.\n\n\n\n## Considerations\n\nEnforcing these changes would entail updates to the Fusion mode backend and should be thoroughly tested.",

[Detailed explanation here](https://gov.1inch.io/discussion/11556-1ip41-stake-1m-dai-to-earn-yield-from-dai-saving-rate?comment=68662)\n***\n**Author**:  [Kene_StableLab](https://gov.1inch.io/profile/id/96991)\n\n### References\n\nhttps://forum.makerdao.com/t/stability-scope-parameter-changes-2-non-scope-defined-parameter-changes-may-2023/20981\n\n# Simple Summary\n\nMakerDAO recently [increased](https://twitter.com/MakerDAO/status/1662161508716150785?t=nLbUp0LaIg_Lvqczhxbw5Q&s=19) its DAI Savings Rate (DSR) from 1% to 3.49%, at the time of writing this proposal the DSR is 5%. \nWe recommend swapping $1M USDC to DAI and staking a total of $1M DAI into the MakerDAO DSR to generate a meaningful yield for the 1inch DAO.\n\n# Motivation\n\nMakerDAO is a veteran DeFi protocol focused primarily on borrowing with its native Stablecoin DAI. As the 1inch DAO’s source of revenue is on the verge of being shut off if [[1IP-28] Discontinue Swap Surplus Collection](https://snapshot.org/#/1inch.eth/proposal/0x62888ad3983a8bdb29e73596b4971a120e6d58ca56929b4a64147a723f6bccc5) passes, it is essential to ensure that our assets are utilised to generate yield for the 1inch DAO. MakerDAO provides one of the safest places to generate yield by using the native DSR for DAI.\n\n**How does the DAI Savings Rate (DSR) work?**\n\nOne of the monetary policy levers that MakerDAO Governance regulates is the DSR, which aids in balancing the supply and demand of DAI. This global parameter is often changed to account for fluctuations in the DAI economy's market circumstances over short periods of time.\n\nThe Stability Fees collected from Vaults are used to fund the DSR. For instance, a DSR of 2% might be funded if the average Stability Fees paid on CDPs is 3%\n\nThese two mechanics offer tools to ensure Dai stability throughout the short and long term.\n\nIn Multi-Collateral Dai, MakerDAO Governance selects a Rates Policy Oracle with restricted access to change the DSR in real-time within a predetermined time frame stipulated by governance as part of the governance process. Other crypto-economic safeguards for the Rates Policy Oracle include a localised emergency shutdown mechanism, which enables the Maker Governance Risk Teams to quickly move to shut down the DSR Oracle until a vote by MKR holders may replace it.\n\nThe Risk Team, or a group of Risk Teams, work together to operate the Rates Policy Oracle under the direction of Maker Governance to implement the Rates Policy in accordance with the predetermined objective.\n\n# Specification\n\nThis investment proposal will be using the 1inch Aggregator to swap 1 million USDC to DAI through the PSM and then depositing the DAI into the DSR and minting sDAI directly. \n\nIn order to achieve this, this proposal has two different payloads.\n\nThis proposal suggests using SavingsDAI (sDAI) which is an ERC20-compliant token that conforms to the ERC4626 specification.\n\nBy using sDAI, the 1inch DAO can hold sDAI directly in the 1inch Treasury to represent its DSR yield.\n\n## Next Steps\n\nIf this proposal passes, the two transaction batches will be executed to facilitate this investment.",

      "title": "[1IP-44] A Limit Order Protocol Extension for Whales | Grant Request",
      "content": "## Simple Summary\n\nThe [Shipyard Software](https://www.shipyardsoftware.org/) team is building Tanker, a Dynamic Limit Order Protocol dApp with the capability of plugging into the 1inch Limit Order protocol. We are requesting a grant to help fund Tanker’s development. Should the grant be approved, Shipyard will grant 1inch a license to integrate Tanker into its frontend (at 1inch's discretion) once development is complete. This proposal is requesting approval of a grant to build Tanker, integration of Tanker into 1inch will be at the discretion of 1inch Labs and is not part of the approval of this proposal.\n\n## Abstract\n\nTanker will be built as a protocol and a standalone frontend interface, with whale traders as its target users. The Tanker Dynamic Limit Order Protocol (DLOP) stands to benefit the 1inch platform, should they choose to integrate it, by making the platform more useful and attractive for whales. Even if Tanker is not integrated into the 1inch frontend, it will still improve execution for 1inch traders through pathfinder.\n\n## Motivation\n\n**The Problem:** Currently, whales looking to swap $50k-$500k in mid-tier tokens (on 1inch, for example) face prohibitively high slippage costs. For example, a whale trying to swap 1M MANA to ~$350k USDC would experience a whopping ~13% slippage (at the time of writing).\n\nThe only way for whales to avoid this high slippage is to break the order into chunks and sell them over time at varying prices. However, this (a) is a pain to manage and (b) creates redundant gas costs.\n\n**The Solution:** Tanker solves this problem by automating the process, both saving them time and avoiding high slippage costs. For example, the whale looking to sell 1M MANA could create a DLOP order that would break the order up for them and sell it over a chosen timeframe (at the Chainlink oracle price) to other users looking to fill smaller orders. This essentially creates a maker-taker scenario where the whale trader becomes the maker and the takers are the thousands of already existing orders. Another key component of Tanker is that it provides MEV protection for large trades of valuable but thinly-traded assets. MEV skimming is very common on such trades now. Tanker is a MEV-robust mechanism.\n\n## Specification\n\n**Go To Market**\n\nUsing the 1inch platform as an example, takers would be regular 1inch traders who may not even know they are using Tanker (there will be no disruption to their trading). It will just be another liquidity source for them available through pathfinder and 1inch API (Tanker is built for Pathfinder’s standard interface).\n\nWhales (the makers) are difficult to acquire, but they already use 1inch today. Thus, Tanker could benefit a platform like 1inch by improving execution for its traders and making it more useful for whales.\n\n**Revenue Model**\n\nUnlike a typical maker-taker scenario, whales are not making the market to seek yield, but rather to liquidate their positions. Because of this, the makers (whales) don’t demand fees and instead, the protocol can collect the fees. For revenue, Tanker will take a small percentage fee on all trades filled via Tanker.\n\nIf this grant proposal is approved, Shipyard will give 1inch a license to integrate Tanker into its front-end (at 1inch's discretion). This license will also entitle 1inch to a 50-50 spit of Tanker's protocol revenues with AdmiralDAO (the DAO that governs Shipyard Software products), should 1inch choose to integrate Tanker into its frontend at any point.\n\n**ASK**\n\nWe propose that 1inch grants the Shipyard team $250k to cover the development costs for Tanker.\n\nIf this proposal passes, the $250k will be transferred to the 1inch DAO operating multisig wallet upon passage and the operating multisig will be authorized to pay the grant to Shipyard upon delivery of the code and license described above.\n\n## Rationale\n\nShipyard Software is a team of seasoned DEX/DeFi tool builders. [Clipper DEX](https://clipper.exchange/), built by Shipyard, is integrated with the 1inch Network, and last year was involved in swaps that sent [$646k in value](https://dune.com/queries/2756057/4586056) to the 1inch DAO.\n\n## Considerations\n\nWe have spoken with various members of the 1inch Labs team and have the following assessments:\n\n* Backend: Pathfinder integration is required so 1inch’s router can incorporate Tanker’s orders, which are stored and managed by Tanker. Estimate is ~3 days active development time and is the same as integrating any other AMM.\n* Smart Contracts: None required.\n* Frontend: None required for standalone dapp. TBD if 1inch decided to integrate into its frontend.\n\n**Other FAQs:**\n\n**Q: Will the Chainlink oracle price offer enough spread such that orders will hit it?**\n\n**A:** At least half the time, the Chainlink oracle is less than or equal to the market price, and recall that there is no slippage. So orders should hit it frequently.\n\n**Q: What could a 1inch extension marketplace look like?**\n\n**A:** This proposal is not recommending that Tanker be implemented as a 1inch extension or that 1inch implements an extension marketplace at this time. However, it is an interesting idea that Tanker could be a test case for that once it is proven as a dapp. As Uniswap begins deploying hooks, it will become more and more strategic for 1inch to build an extension marketplace to compete. Tanker is a good example of what an extension for such a marketplace could be. In fact, Uniswap just announced it will be building a similar product called [TWAMM](https://blog.uniswap.org/v4-twamm-hook). Tanker is a direct alternative to Uniswap’s product, except it would be native to 1inch and fill orders using the 1inch limit order protocol and pathfinder rather than Uniswap hook pools.\n\nFor fun, we imagine a mockup like the below for Tanker if it were integrated into 1inch and for a 1inch extension marketplace:\n\n![image](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-4qst19opsMtnLVhINZliYyuodvGfD04QetXWXr3hdgt1YAhQfCVm0XjqncqORB5iNvScbCXafxYk8DzhDn0wAgCtX4ZDmpRkJRn7wE-utZTsKrH-ryPK1VzutR6O5AyWhb-uxKfZ4kEd8oc0Y-bqKs)\n\n![image](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/UsPmkX4VLDNnUbKZR_bwziR2fPMf02-6FujIhWuLXBr5D5J7jPvgNeLqvPiZKjE218K7d1rMpclashBOUUVDWLt7v3uz-yTAcBoUw65YNoft_Rnh66TcG9isuu-WqBN4IkzSjMHSrclQb4m1i1_oaF8)",

This proposal aims to secure the second part of the payment that was meant to be disbursed upon delivery of the dashboard.\n\n\n\nThe dashboard can be accessed here: https://analytics.1inch.community/\n\n\n\n## Important note\n\n\n\nWhile the majority of the features from the original proposal have been incorporated into the dashboard, some data could not be reasonably accessed via the Dune API due to the excessive amount of data and the need for frequent updates, which would exceed the current plan limits. As a result, we have removed the related features from the initial proposal and adjusted the pricing accordingly. We remain open to adding these features in the future if the necessary data becomes available.\n\n\n\n## Features\n\n\n\nHere is the list of features that were included in the dashboard along with those that were removed:\n\n\n\n### Included\n\n\n\n\n\n* Users metrics \n\n* DAU, WAU, MAU\n\n* Cumulative user count\n\n* Transactions\n\n* Daily, weekly and month trade count\n\n* Volume\n\n* Daily volume, weekly volume, monthly volume\n\n* 1inch Fusion KPIs\n\n* Total orders, volume, unique users (current + historical)\n\n* Top transactions\n\n* Top traders\n\n* Explore and compare resolvers\n\n* Compare and access all resolvers in a leaderboard view - Sort by unicorn power, staked 1Inch, all-time fees, total orders, …\n\n* Breakdown per resolver (Total orders and volume, Historical orders and volume, Historical fees, Staked 1inch / unicorn power / lockout period)\n\n* Protocol treasury balances per token.\n\n* Cumulative treasury revenue over time\n\n* List of treasury transactions\n\n* Protocol revenues (daily/weekly/monthly)\n\n* Revenue as a percentage of volume (daily/weekly/monthly)\n\n* Token price over time\n\n* Token unlock supply schedule over time\n\n* TVL\n\n* Amount of staked 1INCH (st1INCH)\n\n* Estimated gas cost in USD\n\n* Gas price in GWEI chart\n\n\n\nWe also commit to providing 1 year of hosting and maintenance for this website.\n\n\n\n### Excluded\n\n\n\n\n\n* Volume by underlying liquidity source\n\n* Breakdown of the number of trades per DEX\n\n* List and search individual transactions\n\n* Staking rewards\n\n\n\n## Cost adjustment and payment structure\n\n\n\nBy removing features, we are also adjusting the final payment. The initial cost of this project was 85k USDC, with 25k USDC paid upfront and 7.5k USDC withheld due to the feature removal.\n\n\n\nThis results in a final amount of 52.5k USDC, which we request to be sent to the following address: `0x70cd17186aae48729f12dBA63Ba5a9aBE7b4116D`.",

      "title": "[1IP-43] Optimizing Fusion Mode: Smart Contract-Enforced Gas Fee Limit and Lowered Unicorn Power Threshold",
      "content": "## Simple Summary\n\n- Enforce an Ethereum gas fee limit in the 1inch Fusion mode smart contracts, setting a priorityFee cap based on the block’s baseFee.\n\n- Implement a penalty system, in which violators are barred from filling Fusion mode orders. \n\n- Reduce the Unicorn Power (UP) requirement for Resolvers from 10% to 5%.\n\n\n\n## Abstract\n\nThe proposal aims to both decrease operational costs for Fusion Mode Resolvers and encourage broader participation by introducing a smart contract-enforced priority gas fee limit and a penalty system. Furthermore, by lowering the UP requirement for Resolvers, the Fusion Mode ecosystem will be more accessible.\n\n\n\n## Motivation\n\nCurrently, Resolvers face discouragingly high operational expenses, primarily due to inflated gas fees during auctions. This issue is exacerbated due to resolvers competing with each other, leading to \"resolver gas wars\". The costs of these wars are ultimately borne by participants in the 1inch Network, either through resolvers making smaller profits on filling orders or Fusion Mode users getting worse rates on their trades. \n\n\n\nIn addition, new resolvers are deterred by the high UP requirement for participation. These proposed changes directly address these issues by regulating gas costs and reducing entry thresholds.\n\n\n\n## Specification \n\n\n\n1. **Smart Contract-enforced maximum gas fee:** Implement a rule on the 1inch Fusion mode smart contracts that caps priority gas fees. All attempts to circumvent this restriction, including direct payment to a block builder’s coinbase, will result in a violation. Violations of this limit should trigger the enforcement of penalties.\n\n   - For blocks with baseFee <10.6 gwei – the priorityFee is capped at 70% of the baseFee. \n\n   - For blocks with baseFee between 10.6 gwei and 104.1 gwei – the priorityFee is capped at 50% of the baseFee.\n\n   - For blocks with baseFee >104.1 gwei – priorityFee is capped at 65% of the block’s baseFee. \n\n\n\n2. **Penalty mechanism:** Offending resolvers will be barred from filling Fusion mode orders. \n\n   - First offense – official warning\n\n   - Second offense – one (1) day block from filling orders\n\n   - Third offense – seven (7) day block from filling orders\n\n   - Fourth offense – thirty (30) day block from filling orders\n\n   - Fifth offense – three-hundred sixty-five (365) day block from filling orders\n\n\n\n3. **Decrease in UP threshold:** Propose to lower the UP requirement for Resolvers from 10% to 5% via an alteration in the DAO's governance smart contract.\n\n\n\n**Implementation**:\n\n- If successfully passed, this proposal will be implemented on October 16th.\n\n- This proposal signals to the 1inch Foundation and 1inch Labs to implement this proposal:\n\n   - 1inch Labs should deploy the changes described in this proposal\n\n   - 1inch Foundation should change the public [Fusion Mode Terms of Use for Resolvers](https://docs.1inch.io/assets/files/1inch-Network-Fusion-Swap-Terms-of-Use-for-Resolvers-434356011a6f99d6de8cb3774b615f47.pdf) and communicate these changes with Resolvers\n\n   - The 1inch Foundation should help enforce the penalties described in this proposal\n\n\n\n## Rationale\n\nRestricting the priority gas fee protects resolvers from excessive operational costs, thus maintaining long-term sustainability. The baseFee ranges described in the specification section are based on [historical data](https://dune.com/queries/3038247/5054333) and aim to allow 99.99% of transactions to get included within 15 blocks.\n\n\n\nA penalty mechanism reinforces compliance amongst the participants while preserving fair competition. \n\n\n\nLowering the UP requirement expands the number of resolvers, promoting diversity and robustness in the Fusion Mode ecosystem.\n\n\n\n## Considerations\n\nEnforcing these changes would entail updates to the Fusion mode backend and should be thoroughly tested.",

      "title": "[1IP42] Karma Delegate Dashboard for 1inch DAO",
      "content": "Author: @mmurthy \n## Summary\nKarma would like to implement a custom delegate dashboard that can be used by the 1inch DAO and the community to onboard delegates, get visibility into their activities, hold them accountable, improve voting participation and further decentralize the DAO.\n\n## Abstract\nKarma will set up the delegate dashboard for contributors to sign up and update their profile. Our team will work with the DAO and index all the systems where delegate activity can be tracked. This will include Snapshot, CommonWealth forum, Discord and any other systems that contributors are active in. The aggregated stats will be updated on a daily basis and displayed in the dashboard for the community to monitor. Token holders can utilize this information to find the right candidate to delegate their voting power to.\nNew addition: The dashboard will also have a new page to display recognized delegates eligible for compensation for each month.\n\n## Motivation\nEffective governance in a DAO requires a diverse group of governance participants, each bringing their unique perspectives and expertise to the table. To ensure that all voices are heard, it's crucial to remove any friction that may discourage potential delegates from signing up to participate.\nAt the same time, token holders need guidance in choosing the right delegates to represent their interests. Once elected, delegates have a duty to act in the best interests of the DAO, and transparency is key to building trust and accountability within the community. By providing visibility into their activities and decision-making processes, delegates can earn the trust of the token holders they serve.\nTo help delegates improve their participation and overall governance, it's essential to track and analyze key metrics. This data can be used to identify areas of improvement and optimize decision-making processes, ultimately leading to better outcomes for the DAO.\nAt Karma, we understand the importance of these issues and have developed a dashboard that addresses them head-on. Our platform streamlines the delegate sign-up process, provides guidance for token holders, and offers detailed metrics and insights to help delegates improve their performance. With Karma, we believe that effective governance in a DAO is not just possible, but within reach.\n\n## Specification\nThe implementation of the dashboard involves 3 steps which are explained below.\n\n**1) Indexing Contributions**\nKarma will index 1inch DAOs sources relevant to DAO governance contributions. These can include (but are not limited to):\nSnapshot voting\nSnapshot delegation\nCommonwealth Forum \nDiscord\n\n**b) Contribution Scoring (optional)**\nFor a simplified review of governance activity and possible follow-up actions (e.g. allocation of voting power), Karma aggregates different contribution data and calculates scores for each delegate.\nAn example of the scoring model used by Gitcoin can be found here: https://github.com/show-karma/reputation-scores/blob/main/src/score/gitcoin-health-score.provider.ts\nFinal scoring results can be seen here: Gitcoin DAO Contributors Leaderboard\nNote: As governance contributions vary from DAO to DAO and have different significance in them, the scoring will be customized in close coordination with the 1inch team. The scoring logic is open source so that anyone can audit and verify the scores at all times. The aggregated data is exposed through APIs and can be freely integrated with other applications as needed.\n\n**c) Insights and Delegation on custom Contribution Dashboard**\nA custom branded dashboard (hosted on 1inch DAO’s subdomain) will be set up to display delegate stats.\nFeatures of the custom dashboard include:\nDelegate onboarding flow\nAbility to link social handles (Twitter, Forum, Discord Handle)\nUpdate delegation pitch and interests\nDisplay Voting stats, history and voting reasons for each proposal\nDisplay Forum stats\nContribution Scores (optionally) \nIntegration with Snapshot delegation\nAbility for token holders to delegate directly from the dashboard\nIn Depth insights about delegates\nAuto tag inactive delegates\nimage\nimage\nimage\nExample: Optimism Delegation Dashboard\n\n**4.Recognized delegate program support**\n1inch DAO has a new recognized delegate program and we would like to expand the scope of the Karma Dashboard to track and display various metrics necessary for compensation. Below are additional features we are proposing building:\n1. Have a clear indicator on dashboard to mark delegates as recognized and display the Tier they belong to.\n2. Have a compensation page that displays all the delegates who have qualified for that month's compensation along with the following metrics\n - Total Unicorn Power held that month\n - Communication %\n - Voting %\n - Anything else that needs to be tracked for qualification.\n\n## Rationale\nWe are confident the seamless onboarding and deep insights we provide about the contributors will help attract more contributors, strengthen governance and ultimately help the DAO grow.\n\n## Considerations\nThe cost for implementing and managing the dashboard will be $20k for one year (updated from $15k because of additional scope).\nOur team has experience building large scale applications in the blockchain ecosystem for many years. We have already implemented dashboards for a number of DAOs. You can find all the custom delegate dashboard we have built at https://www.karmahq.xyz/daos.\nNote: Created this new thread to follow the proposal guidelines.

      "title": "[1IP42] Karma Delegate Dashboard for 1inch DAO",
      "content": "Author: @mmurthy \n## Summary\nKarma would like to implement a custom delegate dashboard that can be used by the 1inch DAO and the community to onboard delegates, get visibility into their activities, hold them accountable, improve voting participation and further decentralize the DAO.\n\n## Abstract\nKarma will set up the delegate dashboard for contributors to sign up and update their profile. Our team will work with the DAO and index all the systems where delegate activity can be tracked. This will include Snapshot, CommonWealth forum, Discord and any other systems that contributors are active in. The aggregated stats will be updated on a daily basis and displayed in the dashboard for the community to monitor. Token holders can utilize this information to find the right candidate to delegate their voting power to.\nNew addition: The dashboard will also have a new page to display recognized delegates eligible for compensation for each month.\n\n## Motivation\nEffective governance in a DAO requires a diverse group of governance participants, each bringing their unique perspectives and expertise to the table. To ensure that all voices are heard, it's crucial to remove any friction that may discourage potential delegates from signing up to participate.\nAt the same time, token holders need guidance in choosing the right delegates to represent their interests. Once elected, delegates have a duty to act in the best interests of the DAO, and transparency is key to building trust and accountability within the community. By providing visibility into their activities and decision-making processes, delegates can earn the trust of the token holders they serve.\nTo help delegates improve their participation and overall governance, it's essential to track and analyze key metrics. This data can be used to identify areas of improvement and optimize decision-making processes, ultimately leading to better outcomes for the DAO.\nAt Karma, we understand the importance of these issues and have developed a dashboard that addresses them head-on. Our platform streamlines the delegate sign-up process, provides guidance for token holders, and offers detailed metrics and insights to help delegates improve their performance. With Karma, we believe that effective governance in a DAO is not just possible, but within reach.\n\n## Specification\nThe implementation of the dashboard involves 3 steps which are explained below.\n\n**1) Indexing Contributions**\nKarma will index 1inch DAOs sources relevant to DAO governance contributions. These can include (but are not limited to):\nSnapshot voting\nSnapshot delegation\nCommonwealth Forum \nDiscord\n\n**b) Contribution Scoring (optional)**\nFor a simplified review of governance activity and possible follow-up actions (e.g. allocation of voting power), Karma aggregates different contribution data and calculates scores for each delegate.\nAn example of the scoring model used by Gitcoin can be found here: https://github.com/show-karma/reputation-scores/blob/main/src/score/gitcoin-health-score.provider.ts\nFinal scoring results can be seen here: Gitcoin DAO Contributors Leaderboard\nNote: As governance contributions vary from DAO to DAO and have different significance in them, the scoring will be customized in close coordination with the 1inch team. The scoring logic is open source so that anyone can audit and verify the scores at all times. The aggregated data is exposed through APIs and can be freely integrated with other applications as needed.\n\n**c) Insights and Delegation on custom Contribution Dashboard**\nA custom branded dashboard (hosted on 1inch DAO’s subdomain) will be set up to display delegate stats.\nFeatures of the custom dashboard include:\nDelegate onboarding flow\nAbility to link social handles (Twitter, Forum, Discord Handle)\nUpdate delegation pitch and interests\nDisplay Voting stats, history and voting reasons for each proposal\nDisplay Forum stats\nContribution Scores (optionally) \nIntegration with Snapshot delegation\nAbility for token holders to delegate directly from the dashboard\nIn Depth insights about delegates\nAuto tag inactive delegates\nimage\nimage\nimage\nExample: Optimism Delegation Dashboard\n\n**4.Recognized delegate program support**\n1inch DAO has a new recognized delegate program and we would like to expand the scope of the Karma Dashboard to track and display various metrics necessary for compensation. Below are additional features we are proposing building:\n1. Have a clear indicator on dashboard to mark delegates as recognized and display the Tier they belong to.\n2. Have a compensation page that displays all the delegates who have qualified for that month's compensation along with the following metrics\n - Total Unicorn Power held that month\n - Communication %\n - Voting %\n - Anything else that needs to be tracked for qualification.\n\n## Rationale\nWe are confident the seamless onboarding and deep insights we provide about the contributors will help attract more contributors, strengthen governance and ultimately help the DAO grow.\n\n## Considerations\nThe cost for implementing and managing the dashboard will be $20k for one year (updated from $15k because of additional scope).\nOur team has experience building large scale applications in the blockchain ecosystem for many years. We have already implemented dashboards for a number of DAOs. You can find all the custom delegate dashboard we have built at https://www.karmahq.xyz/daos.\nNote: Created this new thread to follow the proposal guidelines.

This grants round is based on quadratic funding to deploy the initial 50% of matching funds, a month long campaign of workshops, and irl events to measure milestones before distributing the remaining 50% as retroactive funding.\n\n\n\n## Motivation\n\n\n\nThis new format in grant distribution allows round sponsors to directly benefit from funding public goods by incentivizing grantees to build, promote and adopt partner platforms and products. Public Goods funding currently doesn't offer a direct and measurable impact on funding partners. By implementing new mechanics into the Gitcoin ecosystem, we hope to create added value for funding partners. 1inch will directly benefit from funding many of LatAm's leading web3 education and community projects, builders and teams working on regenerative solutions in their region.\n\n\n\n## Specification\n\n\n\nThis new format combines Quadratic Funding and Retroactive Funding to fund and rewards teams doing work to grow 1inch's presence in the LatAm region.\n\n\n\nReceiving wallet: 0x0bbb83Bb947b96d298e972e8Ee7534361B707925\n\n\n\nAmount: $27,500\n\n\n\n## Rationale\n\n\n\nThis new format is being pursued to create added value for funding partners because we believe funding public goods is good, but creating impact for partners funding public goods is better. Public Goods funding is still in an experimental phase and we're excited to continuously improve on distribution of grant funding and impact for our partners.\n\n\n\n## Considerations\n\n\n\nThe first consideration is the amount of added work this new format entails. The Gitcoin team will be working with round partners to create relationships with grantees and host community calls to make eligibility criteria clear and provide updates on grantee impact. We will also conduct sybil detection after the round to ensure the QF mechanism isn't being exploited.\n\n\n\n* Grantee onboarding and support: Communicate the eligibility requirement clearly to potential grantees during the application process. Provide guidance and resources to grantees on how to plan and execute the required activities. Offer support in terms of content creation, workshop facilitation, and adoption assistance.\n\n\n\n* Activity execution: Grantees, with the guidance of funding partners and round operators, will conduct the workshops, create educational materials, or adopt partner products or platforms according to the eligibility requirement. Round operators will provide hands-on assistance, guidance, and mentorship throughout the process.\n\n\n\n* Milestone based distribution based on Impact measurement: Establish key metrics to evaluate the impact and success of the eligibility requirement. Measure the number of workshops conducted, educational materials produced, and successful adoptions of partner products or platforms. Collect feedback from grantees, round operators, and funding partners to assess the effectiveness of the initiative.\n\n\n\n* Amplification from our Ambassadors\n\n\n\nTIMELINE:\n\n* Active: Define the eligibility requirement, engage with funding partners\n\n* August 1st -15th: Grantee application and selection process\n\n* August 15th - 29th: GG18 Round\n\n* September 1st - 10th: Round review with funding partners and security team\n\n* Mid September: Distribute 50% of matching funds\n\n* October 1st: Review Grantee Milestones and distribute remaining matching funds\n\n\n\nBUDGET:\n\n* $25k For Matching Pool\n\n* +10% base platform fee\n\n\n\nAdditional fees may apply if 1inch team would like Gitcoin to absorb some of the tasks related to eligibility process and grantee management relating to milestones set.\n\n***\n\n*This is a re-vote of last week's 1IP-37 as there was a bug with the initial vote that prevented some users from voting.*\n\n***",

      "content": "**Author:** [Alex](https://gov.1inch.io/profile/id/99334)\n\n# Simple Summary\n\nI want to solve the problem of lack of understanding of 1inch products. I am sure that the products of the project are underestimated and should be talked about louder and conveyed to more users. A lot of people who use 1inch mainly for token exchange don't realize that it can be done much more efficiently and get more tokens than they expected. Knowledge about DeFi is complex for many users, only a small group of people will follow through and try to understand, spending a lot of their time on it.\n\nMy goal is to simplify content and talk about DeFi and 1inch products in simple language so that new knowledge is accessible to every user. To improve and adapt the content to the needs of the community by conducting surveys on what topic they are most interested in. As 1inch is part of the wider DeFi ecosystem, it is important to provide content that helps audiences better understand this market. This will include analyzing DeFi trends, reviews of projects that partner with 1inch.\n\nCreating content related to strategies, I will offer tips on how to effectively utilize 1inch. This will include tips on risk management and optimizing returns. I will be researching the DeFi market and will provide the user with an overview of current trends, trading volumes and forecasts for this area. This will help users to understand how 1inch fits into the overall market picture and what opportunities they can get by using this platform. Also in the content, I will devote a lot of time to project security. All with examples and personal experience.\n\nCreating interactive content to grab the attention of users and improve their interaction with the platform. This can also help in collecting feedback and gaining valuable data on user preferences.\n\n# Motivation\n\nMy personal motivation is the desire to create content for the community. Before the grant offer was created, I made more than 15 tweets, more than 10 of which were educational on 1inch products with a total \"Impressions\" of 300,000. This grant is an opportunity for me to create more content about 1inch and dedicate 100% of my time to it.\n\nThe project needs a new breath, and variety of content. I will become a new adherent of 1inch bringing the ideas of the project to new masses. Together with the community, we will go through a journey of rethinking the product. We will look at it from a different angle.\n\n# Rationale\n\nWhat the proposal will include:\n\n- Creation of information threads about the 1inch project. They will be aimed at explaining the products of the project in more detail and explaining complex terms and concepts in simple words, so that even a novice user can understand the work process.\n- Creation of articles that will aim to tell about important details of the project, show your personal experience of using 1inch, give food for thought and make you start to learn more about 1inch as a product.\n- Creating step-by-step instructions for beginners.\n- DeFi education, or how to start understanding the DeFi market, using 1inch as an important tool in applying different strategies.\n- Engaging opinion leaders from the DeFi market. There are a lot of DeFi bloggers in my social circle, who are known by most who have tried to do something in the DeFi sector at least once in their lives. Incentivize them to do native threads about 1inch products and updates.\n\n\n\n### Content Examples\n\n[Refer to proposal forum discussion for examples]\n\n# Considerations\n\nIncreasing user literacy, development of the DeFi industry and decentralization. To give everyone who wants to understand the topic of decentralized finance and 1inch products an opportunity to do it for free.\n\n### Add\n\nAlso, I will generate ideas for the 1inch team by suggesting new solutions and product updates.

We aim to cultivate a decentralized contributor base through these talented groups of individuals, enabling them to start and own projects that generate value for the 1inch DAO.\n* **Onboarding Delegates** : Enhancing the quality of the DAO’s governance process involves incentivizing delegates to contribute to the DAO actively. At StableLab, we are working towards onboarding more delegates to the 1inch DAO to improve the quality of 1inch Governance and efforts towards decentralization.\n* **Building a strong developer community to grant pipeline** : The 1inch DAO stands to largely benefit from cultivating a core developer community. We believe that with a robust developer community, the 1inch DAO could incubate grants that ultimately generate value for the entire 1inch ecosystem.\n* **Treasury Management** : The 1inch DAO would benefit from standardizing its treasury management strategy. We will actively work towards finding solutions to effectively manage the 1inch treasury, with four primary goals in mind: generating yield on treasury assets, funding grants that create value for the 1inch DAO, monitoring our burn rate, and managing DAO expenses effectively.\n* **Decentralization** : Decentralizing the DAO is a gradual process that involves investing in a DAO Constitution, DAO Contributors, Delegates, and a DAO Grants Program. Through these initiatives, we aim to build a fully decentralized 1inch DAO.\n\n**KPIs for Engagement**\n\nHow should the DAO evaluate the success of the StableLab Delegate engagement?\n\n**KPI 1** : Number of proposals posted on the forum related to the program and feedback provided Community Builder Proposals and initiatives.\n\n**KPI 2** : Active efforts made to assist new recognized delegates in joining and contributing to the 1inch DAO.\n\n**KPI 3** : Initiatives led by StableLab to foster a stronger 1inch DAO developer community to grant pipeline.\n\n**KPI 4** : Proposals or steps taken to standardize the 1inch DAO Treasury management strategy.\n\n**KPI 5** : Measures taken to improve the organizational structure of the 1inch DAO, with a clear focus on decentralization and empowering the community with ownership",

      "title": "[1IP 35 ]Amendment to the Recognized delegates program",
      "content": "Authors: DAOplomats.org\n# Simple Summary\n\nThis proposal suggests amending the Recognized delegates program to make it more inclusive while maintaining quality standards \n\n# Abstract\n\nThis proposal suggests amending the existing framework into a three tiered system which will incentivize new delegates with lower voting weight to be recognized and earn their way to becoming a Tier 3 Recognized delegate\n\n# Motivation\n\nThe current version of the Recognized delegates program lacks a clear onboarding path for new delegates to earn reputation and receive delegation from delegators. Hence this proposal suggests modifying the framework to make it easier for new delegates to start contributing and earn their way up to being a tier 3 Recognized delegate.\n\n# Specification\n\nOverview:\n\nA recognised delegate is an elected, paid position of reputable, diligent and qualified 1inch DAO members who will work closely with the team and contribute to the growth and sustainability of the 1inchDAO.\n\nRecognized delegates fall into three categories, called ‘Tiers’, based on their performance and voting weight. Irrespective of which tier a delegate belongs to, as long as a delegate fulfils the responsibilities outlined below and gets accepted via a snapshot vote, the delegate shall be considered as a ‘Recognized Delegate’\n\nResponsibilities:\n\nRead, understand, and provide feedback if necessary on governance forum posts.\nAlways vote in the best interests of the DAO and the community over their personal interests.\nActively vote on governance proposals and explain the thinking behind each vote when relevant\nUnderstand the 1inch Network, its key metrics and the overall ecosystem.\n\nCompensation:\n\nThis Recognised Delegates Programme aims to attract and retain entities and individuals who will actively participate in governance on behalf of 1INCH token-holders as governance specialists. Hence we suggest compensating the delegates based on minimum participation and performance. \n\nDelegates will be compensated based on the tiers\n\nDelegate Tier\nMonthly Compensation\n1\n$100\n2\n$500\n3\n$4000\n\n\n\nCompensation eligibility:\n\nMinimum Participation: A delegate must maintain at least  ‘x’% participation rate. Participation is measured as voting in any “temperature check” or a snapshot governance vote.\n\nMinimum Communication: A delegate must maintain at least  ‘y’ % communication rate. Communication is measured as providing for any “temperature check” or a snapshot governance vote, a summary, a voting position, and a justification for that position. A missed vote will still require communication to avoid a lower communication rate.\n\nMinimum Delegation Threshold: To remain eligible for delegate incentives, a delegate must maintain voting weight of at least ‘z’ Unicorn Power (UP)\n\n\nMetrics\nTier 3\nTier 2\nTier 1\nVoting Participation\n80%\n80%\n80%\nCommunication\n80%\n80%\n80%\nDelegation threshold\n500,000\n100,000\n10,000\n\n\n*above calculations will be made from the time a delegate is accepted as a recognized delegate by the DAO by following the procedure outlined below\n\nProcedure:\n\nIn order to get accepted as a ‘Recognized delegate’ by following the process below:\n\nPhase 1: Announce your candidacy by filling the Recognized Delegate Application Template [here] and posting it to the Recognized Delegates category of the forum \n\nPhase 2: Contact relevant stakeholder to gather feedback and support\n\nPhase 3: Open a temperature check poll to gauge consensus\n\nPhase 4: Post your proposal on snapshot \n\n\n\n\n# Rationale\n\nThis amendment clarifies the procedure that delegates need to follow and allows a tiered onboarding path for potential delegates to join the program. \n\n# Considerations\n\nThe 1inchDAO should consider building a reputation dashboard so that anyone can track the voting history and performance of delegates. \nWe suggest that the program continues for a minimum of 6 months as outlined in the original proposal and for a maximum until the budget runs out\nThe DAO should consider hiring a Governance Operations Specialist who can keep a track on the performance of delegates, schedule payments and highlight code of conduct violations",

      "title": "[1IP-33] Implement Dynamic Fusion Mode Resolver Whitelist Based on Unicorn Power Threshold",
      "content": "**References**\n\n\n\n[[1IP-19] Increase the Number of Whitelisted Fusion Mode Resolver to 10](https://snapshot.org/#/1inch.eth/proposal/0x4b16ca79084d3e25768c8d419943624c0dec6865be359855687c532342e87b86)\n\n\n\n\n\n## Simple Summary\n\n\n\nThis proposal seeks to introduce a dynamic Fusion mode resolver whitelist in the 1inch Network. This whitelist would be determined by whether a resolver has received delegations of 10% or more of the total Unicorn Power in the network.\n\n\n\n\n\n## Abstract\n\n\n\nIf passed, this proposal will transition the resolver whitelist for 1inch Fusion mode from a static to a dynamic system. To qualify for the whitelist, a resolver must have received delegations equating to 10% or more of the total Unicorn Power in the network. The maximum limit of resolvers on the whitelist will remain ten (10).\n\n\n\n\n\n## Motivation\n\n\n\nThe previous move to increase the number of resolvers to ten was intended to foster competition and provide users with better rates. However, this has led to the current scenario where the number of high-quality resolvers is fewer than the spots on the whitelist.\n\n\n\nTransitioning to a dynamic whitelist based on Unicorn Power delegations encourages greater competition among resolvers as they will need to gather enough delegated UP to hit the 10% threshold.\n\n\n\n\n\n## Specification\n\n\n\nThis proposal serves as a signal from the 1inch Network DAO to 1inch Labs. If the proposal is passed, the 1inch Network DAO calls for 1inch Labs to implement a dynamic whitelist for Fusion mode resolvers, based on a Unicorn Power delegation threshold. Resolvers will need at least 10% of the total network UP in order to be whitelisted.\n\n\n\n\n\n## Rationale\n\n\n\n**User benefits:** This proposal aims to revive the competition among resolvers, ensuring that only the most efficient and committed resolvers participate in the Fusion mode, thereby enhancing service quality. Fewer resolvers reduces gas costs for settlement -- improving rates for the user.\n\n\n\n**Resolver benefits:** Limiting the number of resolvers to only the most effective ones will concentrate the rewards among fewer participants, incentivizing more Unicorn Power delegation.\n\n\n\n\n\n## Considerations\n\n\n\n1inch Fusion mode has already been audited and deployed. This proposal is anticipated to have no negative security implications as it merely seeks to adjust the number of participants in the first four minutes of the Dutch auction.",

      "content": "**Simple Summary**\n\nThe StableLab team is requesting a grant to write the first draft of the 1inch DAO Constitution and a revamp of the 1inch Governance Documentation to help support the DAO as it progresses towards decentralization.  \n\n**Motivation** \n\nAs active contributors to the 1inch DAO, this grant seeks to extend StableLab’s work to offer deeper insights into how 1inch DAO can improve.\nIn a previous grant (funded by the 1inch Foundation), the main deliverable was a Decentralization Report outlining the current state of 1inch Governance, its successes, its shortcomings, and the necessary next steps to improve the decentralisation and maturity of the 1inch DAO.\n\n**Specification**\n\nThis subsequent grant builds upon this previous work and includes new deliverables, such as:\n\n1inch DAO Governance Documentation Revamp\n1inch DAO Constitution\n\n**1inch DAO Constitution**. - $26,000\n\n1inch DAO stands to benefit significantly from the development of a Constitution, a document that serves as the primary source of direction for how the DAO operates.\nThe constitution will lay out a well-defined scope of responsibilities to be divided between 1inch Labs and 1inch DAO. By defining responsibilities, the Constitution will be able to implement accountability mechanisms and reduce incidents of conflicts arising out of decisions made under each scope. The constitution will also detail the purpose and responsibilities of what the DAO will and will not govern.\n\nAs the primary policy document for the 1inch DAO, this constitution will ensure consistency in how the DAO is managed.

      "title": "[1IP-30] 1inch Hardware Wallet production completion",
      "content": "Summary:\n========\n\nThis proposal is dedicated to the completion of the 1inch Hardware Wallet product development, which includes both software and hardware deliverables. The proposal has been coordinated with 1inch core team and is seeking funding of $2M to complete the product trade version (PTV) of the 1inch hardware wallet. With this funding, we will be able to finalize the product development, set up the manufacturing process, and pass technical and security audits for a successful launch. Our goal is to provide the DeFi community with a cutting-edge solution for handling their crypto assets in a secure, convenient and open-source way, as well as benefit the 1inch ecosystem.\n\nAbstract\n========\n\nWe are building the 1inch hardware wallet as a fully open-source project to enhance 1inch ecosystem and empower the DeFi community with a cutting-edge solution for handling their crypto assets in a simple, convenient and secure way.\n\nLaunched under the 1inch grant program (which you can read about [here](https://blog.1inch.io/the-1inch-foundation-releases-634-000-to-grantees-36a0d097f75)) the project is currently moving into the product finalisation stage. The waitlist for the product is currently hosted through 1inch subdomain - [hw.1inch.io](http://hw.1inch.io/).\n\nWe have been working closely with the 1inch core team and have already coordinated the next steps for the project's development as well as the following proposal.\n\nAs we move forward, we are seeking funds to complete the product trade version (PTV), set up the manufacturing process and undergo technical and security audits to ensure safety and a smooth sales launch.\n\nMotivation\n==========\n\n-   Launch the first hardware wallet designed specifically for the DeFi community. The wallet will feature transparent signing, data decoding, open-sourced hardware & firmware, seamless navigation, HD-wallet support, and a multi-seed wallet.\n-   Expand the capabilities of the 1inch Mobile Wallet and provide seamless integration with the hardware wallet. The 1inch Mobile App will serve as a primary dApp for the hardware wallet, allowing users to easily access a range of DeFi protocols from a single interface.\n-   Make it easy for users to backup and recover the funds. Along with 1inch hardware wallet, we are developing simple backup and recovery solutions, which allow users to export the seed phrase to an external drive.\n\nSpecification\n=============\n\nThe 1inch hardware wallet will be integrated into the 1inch, expanding the 1inch Mobile Wallet ecosystem. It will provide the safest option for storing and managing private keys in a simple, easy, and offline way. Moreover, by launching the hardware wallet under the 1inch branding, we aim to increase brand awareness and establish an additional touchpoint with the DeFi community.\n\n1inch Hardware Wallet key features:\n\n-   Focus on open-source security (users can verify and reprogram the firmware, authenticity check and more)\n-   Enhanced integration with 1inch dApp\n-   Multi-seed option, which enables users to create and control several sets of wallets with different seed phrases (HD wallet algorithm)\n-   Fully air-gapped device with QR code or NFC connection options\n-   Sleek and elegant form factor (lightweight, credit card size)\n-   Transparent transaction signing conducted with full transaction parsing and call data analysis (includes data decoding)\n-   Convenient UX/UI and essential functions (wireless, long-lasting battery, etc.)\n\nRoadmap\n-------\n\nIn 2022, the Hardware Wallet team received a grant of $175k from the 1inch Foundation to develop an MVP (Minimal Valuable Product) of the hardware wallet. The funds were allocated as follows: 15% for supplies and components required for product design, 72 % for team and contractor costs, and 13% for operational expenses. As a result, the team created a working demo board with core functions, including wallet connection and transactions signing, and documented constructed product design.\n\nAs of now, we have successfully moved from MVP to EVT1 stage and completed a working engineer prototype. The team is conducting the alpha test and working on device integration into the 1inch Mobile Wallet app.\n\n![image](https://commonwealth-uploads.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/bd9dff3f-19be-42a1-8170-0724bc3349bd.jpg)\n\nEVT1 Live Demo: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kRwbWE6GfgY\n\nThe second and third quarters of 2023 are dedicated to product refinement to the PVT (Product Validation Test, Trade Version), product acceptance, QA and manufacturing, building integrations and partnerships, international laboratory tests & certifications, and setting up sales channels.\n\nProduct milestones and deliverables breakdown:\n\n*Milestone 0:*\n\nSteps included: factory setup, warehouse maintenance, operational and services costs, purchase of 15 000 MCUs (Microcontroller units)\n\n*Milestone 1: Engineering Validation Test (EVT2)*\n\nSteps included:\n\n-   PRD finalisation, EVT1 refinement to EVT2\n-   Legal (entity setup)\n-   Design and UX/UI improvements\n\nDelivered results: PRD complete (new blueprints, product descriptions), manufactured EVT2 (photo & video, 20 devices), 1inch app test flight and flow, entity details, UI/UX screens\n\n*Milestone 2: Design Validation Test (DVT)*\n\nSteps included:\n\n-   DVT design, manufacturing\n-   Mechanical, electronic, performance verification tests from certified laboratories\n-   Backup & recovery solutions development and manufacturing\n\nDelivered results: Manufactured DVT (photos & videos, ~ 30 devices), crush test results from labs & certifications (components compliance results and pre-certifications results or agreement confirmations with labs), backup & recovery solutions manufactured\n\n*Milestone 3: Channels setup*\n\nSteps included:\n\n-   Sales funnel and logistics configuration\n-   Countries trade licensing and certifications\n-   Store, payments, warranties setup\n\nDelivered results: Sales & Trade Conditions (files), tested orders, ordering details in GitHub (including providers, countries, payments, warranties details), trade licenses status\n\n*Milestone 4: Product Validation Testing (PVT)*\n\nSteps included:\n\n-   First production run\n-   PVT design, manufacturing\n-   QA\n-   getting started and onboarding\n\nDelivered results: Manufactured PVT (photos & videos, 100 devices from different factories) = final product with packaging and supporting materials, getting started guide established\n\n*Milestone 5: Security Audit & Integrations*\n\nSteps included:\n\n-   Independent labs, EAL certification\n-   Other crypto wallets integrations\n\nDelivered results: lab results and statuses (applications filed and paid), integrations status\n\n*Milestone 6: Batch production*\n\nSteps included:\n\n-   preparation, acceptance, manufacturing, assembly, ready-to-ship\n-   price promos\n\nDelivered results: first batch of 1000 devices + limited (photos & videos), limited price promos for the community, online store\n\nNote: Some milestone stages might overlap.\n\nWe are expecting to launch the product for sales (first batch) by the fourth quarter of 2023.\n\nCosts\n-----\n\nBreakdown of the costs by groups for the project duration (6 months):\n\n-   Manufacturing and procurement costs (from beta to the first batch with limited edition) - $600k\n-   Backups & recovery solutions - $75k\n-   Development costs, inc. salaries, product management, contractors - $490k\n-   Technical performance tests verification and certifications from labs - $110k\n-   Security testing and evaluation - $85k\n-   Trade licenses, regional policies and legal establishment- $120k\n-   Patent registration - $40k\n-   Operational costs and corp services - $100k\n-   Sales and supply channels configuration- $250k\n-   Design, onboarding, community price promos - $95k\n-   Partnerships, integrations, business development - $35k\n\nTotal: $2M\n\nPayment structure\n-----------------\n\nWe suggest an upfront payment of $2 million to ensure swift progress and timely delivery. This significant initial investment is pivotal for the successful execution of this hardware project. As we have to secure contracts with component providers right from the outset, the upfront capital will be instrumental in negotiating the best prices. We can take advantage of economies of scale and secure cost-effective deals by purchasing higher-quality components.\n\nAs a start-up company, flexibility is crucial in our operations. Situations may evolve, and adjustments may be required along the way.

      "title": "[1IP 29] Recognised delegates program",
      "content": "Authors  [@DAOplomats.eth](https://daoplomats.org/)\n\n# Simple Summary\nThis proposal suggests creating a 6-month trial of a funded Recognised Delegates Programme for 1inchDAO. \n# Abstract\nThe goal of the Recognised Delegates Programme is to reduce the collective cost of governance and increase the effectiveness and efficiency of the governance process in 1inchDAO. To attract, select and retain the best talent, we suggest vetting each Recognised Delegate (group/individual) based on past performance in 1inchDAO and other DAOs and a compensation structure.\n# Motivation\nCrypto is speed-running in the history of human coordination. As DAOs evolve from their early idealistic vision to becoming more internet-native organisations, so too must the coordination mechanisms evolve. We have seen that specialisation plays a crucial role in traditional organisations. Specialisation allows organisations to maximise efficiency and effectiveness and thus increase productivity overall. All specialised positions, from Gardners to rocket scientists, do their best work when they are adequately compensated for their time and efforts. We believe that this Recognized delegates program will assist the DAO in reducing its collective cost of governance while improving efficiency and direction.\n# Specification\n\nWhat is a Recognized delegate?\nA recognised delegate is an elected, paid position of reputable, diligent and qualified 1inch DAO members who will work closely with the team and contribute to the growth and sustainability of the 1inchDAO \nEligibility:\nHave a minimum 500,000 in voting weight and a maximum of 250,000 in self delegation\nContribute to forum conversations for 3 months\nPost a public link with an audio recording where the delegates communicate their vision and values.\nGet accepted as Recognized delegates by following the process below:\nFramework for Delegates to become recognized delegates\nAt the beginning of the engagement, each delegate posts their goals and plans for the 6 month engagement with the DAO with clear KPIs.If the proposal is approved, then the DAO will accept the delegates as recognized delegates and hold them accountable to the listed KPIs\nThe delegate has to communicate their work at the end of the engagement with a report posted on the forum. \nResponsibilities:\nRead, understand, and provide feedback on governance forum posts if necessary.\nAlways vote in the best interests of the DAO and the community over their personal interests.\nActively vote on governance proposals and explain the thinking behind each vote when relevant.\nUnderstand the 1inch Network, its key metrics and the overall ecosystem.\n\n**Compensation:**\n\nThis Recognised Delegates Programme trial program aims to attract and retain entities and individuals who will actively participate in governance on behalf of 1inch token-holders as governance specialists. Hence we suggest compensating the delegates based on minimum participation and performance.\n**Fixed Compensation:**\nAll recognised delegates meeting the minimum eligibility criteria will receive $4000 in USDC each month. \n\n**Fixed comp eligibility:**\nMinimum Participation: A delegate must maintain at least an 80% participation rate. Participation is measured as voting in any “temperature check” or on-chain governance vote.\nMinimum Communication: A delegate must maintain an 80% communication rate. Communication is measured as providing for any “temperature check” or on-chain governance vote a summary, voting position, and justification for that position. A missed vote will still require communication to avoid a lower communication rate.\n\n**Minimum Delegation Threshold:** To remain eligible for delegate incentives, a delegate must maintain the voting weight of at least 500K 1inch tokens.\n\n# Rationale\nDelegation and compensation mechanisms vary across the DAO ecosystem. Some DAOs such as Maker, OP, and Hop compensate delegates as a % of their voting power, participation, and minimums. We believe that this motivates delegates to accumulate more voting power instead of focusing on positive governance practices in the DAO. Hence we suggest a minimum delegation and participation threshold to qualify for governance rewards.\nBased on delegation examples in traditional organisations, we believe that this methodology offers the best results for the DAO in the short to mid-term, given its current maturity and contributor engagement. We acknowledge that crypto is a fast-evolving space, and the ecosystem may arrive at better governance mechanisms than delegation in the future.\n\n# Considerations\nThe 1inchDAO should consider building a reputation dashboard so that anyone can track delegates' voting history and performance. A platform such as tally.xyz can also make it easy for potential delegators to delegate their tokens. \nIn terms of budget, we suggest setting aside 100,000 USDC for the pilot. We suggest using a separate operations multi-sig to administer these expenses. Any unused funds should be returned back to the DAO after the end of the trial period.",

      "title": "[1IP-28] Discontinue Swap Surplus Collection",
      "content": "**Author**: RoundElephant.eth\n\n**References**\n\n* [What is a swap 'surplus', and where does it end up when my swap is completed? | 1inch.io](https://help.1inch.io/en/articles/5583703-what-is-a-swap-surplus-and-where-does-it-end-up-when-my-swap-is-completed) \n\n* [Revenue stream | 1inch Network docs](https://docs.1inch.io/docs/governance/dao-treasury#revenue-stream)  \n\n## Simple Summary\n\n* Discontinue Swap Surplus collection to provide a more consistent user experience.\n\n* Positive slippage will instead be redirected back to the user.\n\n## Abstract\n\nThis proposal calls for discontinuing the collection of the Swap Surplus (also called positive slippage). Swap Surplus has been highly inconsistent as a revenue stream and can negatively impact a minority of users. \n\nBy prioritizing user experience and long-term growth, the 1inch Network aims to increase its market share and explore alternative revenue streams like the resolver fee mechanism of Fusion Mode. If passed, would-be Swap Surplus funds will be automatically redirected users with the ultimate goal of increasing user satisfaction and promoting the long-term success of the 1inch Network.\n\n## Motivation\n\nThe primary motivation behind this proposal is to enhance user experience on the 1inch platform. \n\nFor the DAO, the Swap Surplus revenue stream has proven to be highly inconsistent over time, with monthly collections varying significantly. In December 2021, revenue collection was approximately $2 million per month, but in recent months, it has dwindled to a few hundred thousand. \n\nFor users, the Swap Surplus collection has led to unpredictability. Though the vast majority of trades are not impacted by Swap Surplus, a small minority have experienced reduced returns of up to 10%. By discontinuing the collection of Swap Surplus revenue, we aim to create a more consistent trading experience for all users.\n\n## Specification\n\nThis proposal serves as a signal from the 1inch Network DAO to 1inch Labs. Once passed, the 1inch DAO calls for 1inch Labs to make the following changes to the protocol backend:\n\n* Discontinue the collection of Swap Surplus revenue within the 1inch Aggregation Protocol.\n\n* Automatically reroute any Swap Surplus funds back to the user during the swap process.\n\n## Rationale\n\nCalling for the discontinuation of Swap Surplus revenue collection is based on the belief that prioritizing user experience and long-term growth will ultimately yield greater benefits for the 1inch Network. With the revenue stream being highly inconsistent and its impact on users varying greatly, the potential drawbacks of continuing to collect Swap Surplus outweigh the benefits.\n\nFurthermore, the introduction of Fusion Mode opens the door for alternative revenue streams that can be more consistent and less controversial. By focusing on these new opportunities, the 1inch Network can work towards increasing its market share and ensuring a more robust and sustainable revenue model.\n\n## Considerations\n\n### Security\n\nThe proposed changes do not pose any significant security risks, as they primarily involve altering the distribution of surplus funds. By rerouting these funds back to the user, the platform remains secure and transparent, with no additional vulnerabilities introduced.\n\n### Governance\n\nIn the short term, this proposal will mean a complete cessation of revenue being collected by the DAO treasury. However, by focusing on long-term growth and user satisfaction, the 1inch Network can strengthen its position in the market, potentially leading to increased revenue in the future.",

      "title": "[1IP 27] Allocate 1M USDC stables in treasury to lending pool on AAVE V3",
      "content": "**Author: @DAOplomats.eth  (@Baer, @jengajojo)**\n\n## Simple-summary\n\nThis proposal suggests allocating 1M USDC of the current USDC balance into AAVE V3 to generate passive yield.\n\n## Motivation\n\n~95% of the current 1inch DAO treasury is in USDC, earning exactly 0% interest or fees. The only source of income is the 1inch DEX. At the same time, there is ~15.5M USDC which could potentially generate income for the DAO with relatively low risk. The current average variable yield in AAVE markets is between 1-2%\n\n\n\n## Specification\n\n**What is lending and borrowing?**\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTp9er6S73M\n\n## AAVE V3\n\nAave is a decentralised non-custodial liquidity protocol where users can participate as depositors or borrowers. Depositors provide liquidity to the market to earn a passive income, while borrowers can borrow in an overcollateralized (perpetually) or undercollateralized (one-block liquidity) fashion.\n\n\n## Expected Yield\n\nThe current average variable yield in both markets is between 1-2%, which means that the DAO can potentially earn between ~ 6000 & ~12000 USDC per month.\n\n\n**Update (13.05.23) :Current  yield in Aave is more than 3%**\n\n\n## Why AAVE?\n\nThe AAVE team has been building since 2017 and the contracts have hosted one of the highest TVLs in DeFi at the moment. This makes depositing in AAVE V3 relatively less risky than any other lending/borrowing protocol. \n\n\n## Considerations\n\n\nThere are several ways to earn a yield on idel treasury assets such as:\n\n**Yield Farming on yield aggregators such as Yearn.Finance**\n\nIn this approach, tokens are deposited into contracts which run the best risk-adjusted farming strategies to earn native tokens, which are swapped back to the original token. This strategy's upside is that yield is farmed automatically and is independent of market activity; however, this comes with slightly higher smart contract risks than the other two options. Another con here is that the Yearn.finance team is completely anonymous, which can be considered a con in some cases\n\n\n\n**Being a liquidity provider on DEXes**\n\n\nAs highlighted in the Stablenode proposal, being a liquidity provider for the native token has several advantages and disadvantages. Since this strategy is already being proposed in another RFC we won’t dive into the details here. The only con we see here is that to provide a significant proportion of the treasury to LPing would mean taking on losses in the form of slippage on top of the risks mentioned in the proposal.\n\n\n## Depositing into a Lending pool\n\nBased on the analysis provided in this proposal, we suggest that depositing in lending pools is the best risk-adjusted strategy for a large treasury allocation. In the current approach, there is no need to do any other complicated swap resulting in slippage or engaging in unnecessary smart contract risks.\n\n## Risks and Disclaimers:\n\nAAVE  Audit report\n\n- https://consensys.net/diligence/audits/2020/09/aave-protocol-v2\n- https://docs.aave.com/developers/deployed-contracts/security-and-audits\n\nDAOplomats will monitor the position and provide an update to the DAO regularly ",

These tokens are held by backers, advisors, and core contributors. Redeeming fully-vested v1INCH for the underlying 1INCH is a manual action that must be taken by the holder.\n\n\n\nCurrently, all v1INCH, no matter where it is along its vesting contract, has a flat 20% weighting compared to st1INCH. This proposal calls for a treatment of v1INCH similarly to that of st1INCH(v2) – v1INCH will have more voting power if there is more time remaining on the vesting schedule (with a 2-year maximum). Here is a breakdown of how the voting weight will change according to the unlock schedule:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n* 1-year cliff to full unlock: 22% voting power\n\n* 1.5-year cliff to full unlock: 47% voting power\n\n* 2-year cliff to full unlock: 100% voting power \n\n* 3-year cliff to full unlock: 100% voting power\n\n* 4-year cliff to full unlock: 100% voting power\n\n\n\n\n\n**Example 1**\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n* Address: 0x812D157dd6CF4aAc6bEfcEd2CE92B725cBEEc39A\n\n* v1INCH balance: 37.5M (only 12.5M is locked until June, everything else is fully vested and claimable)\n\n* VotingPower:\n\n   * Current scheme = 7.5M votes\n\n   * New scheme = 1.73M votes\n\n\n\n\n\n**Example 2**\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n* Address: 0xf2d10DBFB999cF85b0D0a81c9ae70fde5B80310f\n\n* v1INCH balance: 250K \n\n* VotingPower:\n\n   * Current scheme = 50K votes\n\n   * New scheme = 17K votes\n\n\n\n\n\n**Example 3**\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n* Address: 0x317E1b409C0809f0Dd56b8Fb84185e2982106287\n\n* v1INCH balance: 8.57M (everything is locked) \n\n* VotingPower:\n\n   * Current scheme = 1.71M votes\n\n   * New scheme = 2.49M votes\n\n\n\n\n\n**Example 4**\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n* Address: 0x03429fA2D2Ba986D5b9F619c616fE4077a297B98\n\n* v1INCH balance: 500K\n\n* VotingPower:\n\n   * Current scheme = 100K votes\n\n   * New scheme = 276K votes\n\n\n\n\n\n## Snapshot\n\n\n\nThe [1inch Network Snapshot space](https://snapshot.org/#/1inch.eth), and the[ 1inch DAO Fast-Track Signaling Subspace](https://snapshot.org/#/signaling.1inch.eth), will be updated with the following changes:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n* Remove st1INCH (v1) voting and delegation strategies\n\n* Replace existing st1INCH(v2) strategy with one that uses `Unicorn Power` instead `erc20-balance-of`.\n\n* Remove the existing 20% weighted v1INCH strategy\n\n* Add a new voting-power-weighted strategy for v1INCH using this contract: [VestedVotingPower | Address 0xfB7246C98B6e6C8529c06359B237566e5Bc4677C | Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/address/0xfb7246c98b6e6c8529c06359b237566e5bc4677c)\n\n   * This contract gives onchain mapping for the appropriate vesting contract of each v1INCH holder. \n\n   * This is an onchain expression of the logic described in the previous section.\n\n* Change the proposal validation strategy to require 100,000 Voting Weight when creating a new proposal.\n\n\n\n\n\n### Token Contracts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n* v1INCH: [0x03d1b1a56708fa298198dd5e23651a29b76a16d2](https://etherscan.io/token/0x03d1b1a56708fa298198dd5e23651a29b76a16d2) \n\n* st1INCH (v2): [0x9A0C8Ff858d273f57072D714bca7411D717501D7](https://etherscan.io/token/0x9a0c8ff858d273f57072d714bca7411d717501d7) \n\n* st1INCH (legacy): [0xA0446D8804611944F1B527eCD37d7dcbE442caba](https://etherscan.io/token/0xa0446d8804611944f1b527ecd37d7dcbe442caba)\n\n\n\n\n\n# Rationale\n\n\n\nOnchain mapping of vesting contracts to each v1INCH holder was a prerequisite for this proposal as there was no other way of determining if a holder’s v1INCH tokens were fully unvested, partially vested, or fully vested. The 1inch core contributors have deployed the VestedVotingPower smart contract that does this mapping.\n\n\n\nIt is important to note that st1INCH(v1) holders will still be able to unstake their 1INCH at any point in the future. \n\n\n\n\n\n# Considerations\n\n\n\nThis proposal will have no cost to the 1inch DAO Treasury.\n\n\n\nAs opposed to st1INCH(v2), st1INCH(v1) does not require a timelock to participate in governance – a bad actor could use this lack of a time-commitment to abuse the 1inch goverance system. This proposal will prevent that as all votes will only be cast by timelocked tokens.\n\n\n\nOnce passed, the [reality.eth proposal acceptance criteria](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmbNkL7ZpUsP2w7m1bCimkPKqJeSyUxM2K4VkxbaFB8ek5), and the [1inch DAO governance documentation](https://docs.1inch.io/docs/governance/overview), will need to be updated to reflect the change to v1INCH voting weight and the proposal validation strategy.

This allocation will be used to increase brand awareness for the 1inch DAO, leveraging the car's visibility in Kyiv and worldwide. This proposal is being made by Roman Tomera, who has a proven track record of success in investing in the cryptocurrency market and promoting crypto-related content. The car will have license plates with the text «1INCH», which in turn only confirms the idea. The car number \"1INCH\" has already been purchased and assigned to Roman Tomera.\n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreibjvhmviijfvbegogiymud5hib6tatte2dvrygbottghi66u6zexu)\n   # Motivation:\nThe 1inch DAO has an opportunity to increase brand awareness and visibility through a unique and attention-grabbing marketing strategy.\n\nWith 25,734,957 views on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/@savorskaja), 27,200 subscribers on , over 14,000 daily views of [Telegram](https://t.me/cryp_tomera) posts and 28,000 [TikTok](https://www.tiktok.com/@romantomera?_t=8b6V03vkWDV&_r=1) subscribers with a cumulative view count of 5,000,000, Roman Tomera has significant social media influence. By allocating $900,000 worth of $ARB coins from the Arbitrum DAO airdrop to purchase a Lamborghini Revuelto, the DAO can leverage the car's visibility in Kyiv and worldwide to further increase brand awareness.

      "title": "A Community First 1inch DAO NFT Marketplace",
      "content": " Simple Summary\n\nThe 1inch network has successfully positioned itself as the leading decentralized exchange and DEX aggregation platform across multiple networks enabling liquidity and while continuing to enhance capabilities (e.g. wallet, fusion engine) for their community. Because 1inch has been positioned as a leader in DeFi, and given competitor entrance into the NFT marketplace aggregator space, for 1inch to remain competitive within this space, 1inch needs to bring to market a no platform fee NFT marketplace aggregator solution that is sustainable and benefits their community of users while expanding market share to new users. Based on our deep expertise in building web3 solutions, Solidity.io is looking to help create a new NFT marketplace aggregator protocol for the 1inch network. Solidity.io will open source the 1inch marketplace to the desired specifications of the 1inch DAO in order to maintain security, decentralization, and transparency for the community.\n\n\n*Snapshot was not supporting images in this proposal, please click the link to commonwealth to view images for this proposal*\n\nBreakdown of Costs\n\nFront-end:\n\nDesign: 20k\n\nDevelopment: 70k\n\nBack-end:\n\nOrder Indexer/Orderbook: 110k\n\nNFT Indexer/CDN (content delivery network): 55k\n\nOnchain:\n\nOrder Router: 40k \n\nTotal One Time Implementation Costs: $295K (Reduction of $92k from competitor proposal ~24%)\n\nPlatform Maintenance & Ongoing Indexer Updates\n\nOngoing Costs: Estimated at 50k annual \n\nProject Milestones\n\nMilestone:\n\nMilestone 1: Project commencement\n\nMilestone 2: Wireframes complete \n\nMilestone 3: UxUI High fidelity complete \n\nMilestone 4: Onchain router architecture defined (in collaboration with the 1inch foundation)\n\nMilestone 5: Onchain router ready for testnet deployment\n\nMilestone 6: Onchain router deployed to testnet/ audit commencement\n\nMilestone 7: NFT indexer architecture (in collaboration with the 1inch foundation)\n\nMilestone 8: NFT indexer deployed to testnet\n\nMilestone 9: Centralized marketplace aggregated order book architecture (in collaboration with the 1inch foundation)\n\nMilestone 10: 1 Inch limit order protocol Integration\n\nMilestone 11: Aggregate orderbook deployment\n\nMilestone 12: NFT metadata indexer and Content Delivery Network (CDN)\n\nMilestone 13: Frontend layout complete\n\nMilestone 14: Frontend Development complete\n\nMilestone 15: Marketplace ready for Go-Live!\n\n\n\nPayment Milestones:\n\nProposal approved- $65K\n\nMilestone 3 complete - $$55K\n\nMilestone 6 complete - $55K\n\nMilestone 11 complete - $60k\n\nMilestone 14 complete - $60k\n\n\n\nAbstract\n\nA community marketplace is a natural next step for the 1Inch ecosystem. A successful community marketplace will: drive traffic to the 1Inch ecosystem and DEX aggregator product, decrease fees to community members by building a 1Inch-native marketplace with rich user experience, leverage 1Inch’s brand equity to continually acquire marketshare in the DeFi, NFT, & Web3 ecosystem more broadly. In order to compete, this marketplace must be cost competitive with fees in-line with or lower than competitors like X2Y2. \n\nThe 1inch NFT aggregator aims to provide a comprehensive platform for buying, selling, and trading non-fungible tokens (NFTs). The proposed platform seeks to simplify the process of purchasing and managing NFTs by aggregating listings from various popular marketplaces and enabling seamless exchange of NFTs with other cryptocurrencies.\n\nThe 1inch NFT marketplace aggregator offers users a streamlined experience by allowing them to browse, buy, and sell NFTs from multiple marketplaces in one place. The aggregator also offers advanced search and filtering options to help users find specific NFTs based on criteria such as price, rarity, and creator. Additionally, the platform will provide a unified wallet that allows users to store and manage their NFT collections across multiple marketplaces.\n\nGiven 1inch network’s existing platform, the NFT aggregator will also enables users to exchange their NFTs with other cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum and ANY other ERC-20 tokens. This allows for more liquidity in the NFT market and provides a pathway for NFT investors to trade their assets in a decentralized and secure manner.\n\nFor standard marketplace buy and selling, there is no platform fees.\n\nBeyond the table stakes expectations of an NFT marketplace and NFT aggregator, as part of this implementation, the 1inch NFT protocol will leverage the 1inch limit order protocol and bring true limit orders to the NFT space. \n\nFor example, I am a holder of a bored ape yacht club NFT, and the currently floor is 69E. I would like to leave my NFT unlisted to avoid creating additional depth and sell walls, but when the floor reaches a TWAP of 420E, I want my NFT to automatically be listed at any desired price (ex. 2% above a 420E floor).\n\nAnother example of limit orders, would be you are currently traveling by airplane and unable to get connected to internet and the floor of an NFT I am holding is crashing. Fortunately, on the 1inch NFT aggregator platform, I created a stop loss limit order that would allow me to automatically list my NFT if the TWAP floor hits.\n\nAligned to 1inch limit order protocol and the no platform fees model, for NFT limit orders there is also no fees.\n\nMotivation\n\nBased on the current weekly volume data and market share data, it is clear that volume is currently significantly down as compared to the NFT bull run of 2021 and 2022. Additionally, the current farming rewards associated with Blur, have skewed volume and market share. The best example of the effectiveness of aggregators was during the 2021 and 2022 bull run with market share distributed across gem, genie (now Uniswap), and via direct marketplaces (OpenSea).\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile this can be seen as a challenging market, similar could have been said in the period prior to 1inch network DEX aggregator launch. The value proposition of 1inch network is that 1inch continues to build protocols that can be shared and leveraged across the 1inch network. 1inch is able to bring very large market makers within the 1inch network to act as market makers for NFTs with the limit order capabilities, additional product overlap and connection with the existing 1inch network. This creates a pathway for exceptionally more liquidity to enter the NFT space and drive marker makers to be more decentralized.\n\nSpecification\n\nThe proposed marketplace will have the following features: \n\nLimit order creation\n1inch wallet integration (1inch Token)\nWallet connect integration Ethereum\nNative 1inch nft marketplace\nNFT aggregation from (1 inch, openSea, X2Y2, Looksrare, )\nBuy Now\nBids\nOffers\nUsers can purchase NFTs with any token in one transaction on 1inch marketplace using the wallet of their choosing\nUsers can search of nfts though set of filters.

The NFT market is expected to reach more than $232 billion by 2031.\n\nWe are looking to provide the community with an intuitive user experience for creating, collecting, and selling NFTs while empowering the user with the best-in-class power tools to make the best decision in every step of the journey.\n\nThe Marketplace will be unique from competitors by designing a cutting-edge NFT aggregator marketplace with optimized UI/UX to attract NFT/crypto traders to onboard to the platform and take action.\n\nMoreover, the 1inch community will benefit as the Marketplace will provide users with empowering analytics & browsing tools and educational content, for guiding and educating users.\n\nWe would like to request the 1inchDAO a total of $387,022 for creating an MVP of the NFT marketplace\n\n\n## Motivation\n\n1inch is currently the leading decentralized aggregator and has earned a reputation for providing the best prices on token swaps. With the boom in the NFT market, there is a new product segment which 1inch is perfectly positioned to capitalize on - the NFT aggregator marketplace. \n\nOverall, the rise of the NFT market can be attributed to a combination of factors, including the increasing adoption of blockchain technology, the growth of the digital art market, and the availability of online marketplaces that facilitate the buying and selling of NFTs.\n\nLooking at the market potential we can see that even throughout the current bear market the volume of transactions is still growing and specifically the aggregated marketplaces (e.g. Gem and Genie) are taking leading market share\n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreihvjt72nqrz7mlic3g6m2x6nk7ai4r225axktf2c6vbuhuioohg7a)\n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreicoaraethprtk5axsmwgvln2tgik637yccdijsbhq53pcgus4heiu)\n    \n\n\n\nMoreover, looking at current trends we can see that Dec 2022 is showing an improvement in total sales of NFT with market volume of nearly $2B\n\n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreicyrk622zzzjxorl76223ymw6eorlb6u54u3vpp66yaerotn66fsi)\n    \n\n\nBy implementing this proposal, 1inchDAO will expand its services and revenue channels, onboard new users to 1inch network, and add additional utilities to 1inch token\n\n\n## Specification\n\nThe proposed marketplace will have the following features \n\n\n\n* Connect Wallet\n* 1inch wallet integration (1inch Token)\n* MetaMask integration (Ethereum, Binance, Polygon)\n* NFT Aggregate API Integration\n* NFT aggregation from Ethereum, Binance, and Polygon marketplaces\n* Buy Now\n* Users can purchase NFTs with any token in one transaction on 1inch marketplace using the 1inch wallet \n* Bids\n* Users can place bids for the tokens based on their interests. They will enter the details such as the bid amount, and wallet. These bids will be stored on smart contracts and sent to the creators or sellers.\n* Sellers will be able to accept bids from the users based on the amount and preferences.\n* Based on the bids, sellers can sell the tokens on the platform. Once the seller accepts the bid, the amount from the buyer’s wallet will be transferred to the seller's wallet. The transactions and ownership details will be recorded on the blockchain.\n* Search/Filters\n* Advance search engine with user recommendations based on NFT collection volume and spam/fake collection check _(e.g., When you type the name of the collection, it gives you results that are filtered by daily volume, highest volume on top, and gives priority to the collections that have verified checkmark)_\n* Rarity rankings, sort by rarity, sort by specific traits, sort by price\n* My Watchlist\n* Create custom feeds to watch your favorite collections \n* Whale/Influencers wallets watchlists/alerts\n* Wallets leaderboard\n* Get instant alerts sent to your browser, Telegram, or Discord\n* NFT Calendar\n* Upcoming drops / Free mints / Stealth mints / Blockchain real-time scan\n* Add any collection with token address\n* Suggested NFT\n* AI powered “Matching” game or “You may also like” suggestions for NFT\n* Create a single NFT\n* The creators must also choose on what network (Ethereum, Binance, and Polygon) they want to create their NFT\n* Launchpad\n* Create and launch NFT collections (Ethereum, Binance, and Polygon)\n* Share\n* Users will be able to share the collectible with their social media accounts such as Facebook, Twitter, and Telegram\n* Basic Analytics\n* Get live floor prices, volume, and sales data on any collection, wallet, or mint\n* Deep dive into sales history, floor price, volume, and trends. Detailed live and historical charts help you find the perfect entry and exit\n* Access to metrics such as the moving averages over the last sales, profits and losses, and many other insights\n* Unique holders and numbers of transactions\n* Power tools\n* Twitter sentiment score \n* AI algorithm that fetch Twitter data and assigns score to each collection based on sentiment used in tweets\n* Calculated “true” floor price for each collection \n* AI algorithm that fetch social media data and NFT sales data, volume, historical and current listings, and assigns calculated \"true\" floor price for each collection\n* List of top tweets \n* Metrics such as assets purchased below current floor, assets never sold since mint, etc. \n* Trends on Twitter Profile Picture\n\nRevenue from NFT Marketplace: All the service fees for transactions and listing of the NFT Marketplace during the MVP phase will go to 1inchDAO treasury. Additional discussion about revenue allocation as the NFT Marketplace will evolve from the MVP phase will be discussed in due time\n\n*Receiving address for funds distribution*\n\neth: [0x27D2044A1a46FAbBC1071d8F74fDbF6a9dbFb4ae](https://etherscan.io/address/0x27D2044A1a46FAbBC1071d8F74fDbF6a9dbFb4ae)\n\nPotential Revenue channels (conservative projection) and yearly estimated revenue\n\n\n\n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreiencjawbdkzjozjettt2jyrtosvttpz7sund73alcprtq6oo7jhui)\n    \n\nAdditional benefits to the 1inch network \n\n\n\n1. Increase in 1inch user base\n2. Increase in # of wallet downloads\n3. Footprint in the NFT space \n\n\n## Rationale\n\nThe rationale for this proposal is in two folds. First, creating a new revenue channel for 1inch by joining the NFT market which presents a market cap of $11.3 billion and with a predicted compound annual growth rate of 33.7% in the following eight years NFT space will see its total market cap climb to $231 billion by 2030. \n\nSecond, with 1inch protocols and network we can offer the users the best UX for trading NFTs at the lowest transaction cost which will position 1inch at the top tier for NFT trading.\n\nThis proposal aims to develop a leading NFT aggregator marketplace with the best-in-class power tools and analytical and educational features. Competitors and business analysis have been performed to define key features of the proposed 1inch NFT marketplace. \n\nBased on research, the business gaps in the NFT marketplace field are: \n\n\n\n1. Most marketplaces are not focused on giving users intuitive analytical tools to make data-driven decisions. \n2. There are several websites for NFT analysis. Most of them have free tools and paid tools.  \n3. Users are forced to pay a monthly fee to use power tools or switch between different websites to perform analysis.  \n4. Most marketplaces provide a basic browsing experience. \n5. Most competitors offer users minimal education and guidance. \n\nThe key features that will place 1inch NFT Marketplace at the leading position are: \n\n\n\n1. Buy now – users can use ANY token to purchase NFTs in one transaction on the 1inch marketplace.  \n2. Unique and intuitive UX/UI aligned with 1inch design brand.   \n3. Educational/ empowering tools to help users make the right decision.  \n4. Developing an eCommerce community around the marketplace to drive traffic and increase the 1inch user base.  \n\n\n## Considerations\n\nThe proposed NFT marketplace is going to have three levels of security: server, application, and smart contract.\n\nSERVER SECURITY:\n\n- CIS: CIS benchmarks are internationally recognized as security standards for defending IT systems and data against cyberattacks.\n\n- PCI DSS: The Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) is a widely accepted set of policies and procedures intended to optimize the security of users personal information\n\n- AWS BEST PRACTICES: This is a standard set of compliances provided by AWS for best security practices. \n\nAPPLICATION SECURITY:\n\n- User Keys storage is encrypted. Thus, avoiding exposable data. \n\n- Use of SSL to prevent data injection. \n\n- CSRF (Cross Site Request Forgery) handling\n\n- XSS (Cross Site Scripting) \n\n- CAPTCHA (if needed)\n\n- Avoiding Direct DOM access\n\n- SSR (Server-side rendering)\n\n- SNYK Package (Used for best practices to monitor vulnerabilities).\n\nSMART CONTRACT SECURITY:\n\n- SLITHER TEST: Slither is a Solidity static analysis framework written in Python 3. It runs a suite of vulnerability detectors, prints visual information about contract details, and provides an API to easily write custom analyses. Slither enables developers to find vulnerabilities, enhance their code comprehension, and quickly prototype custom analyses.\n\n- CHAI TESTING FRAMEWORK\n\n- OPENZEPPELIN TEST HELPDESK\n\n- DEVELOPMENT & TESTING USING HARDHAT\n\n- VULNERABILITY TESTS USING ECHIDNA FUSSY TEST TOOL\n\n- SECURITY ANALYSIS USING MYTHRIL AUDIT TOOL\n\n- REENTRANCY ATTACK PREVENTION USING OPENZEPPELIN LOG AUDIT\n\nAdditionally, CERTIK audit services will be used for both smart contract audit and application audit.   \n\nVendor support:\n\nDev services will be outsourced to Blockchain App Factory (BAF). Blockchain App Factory (BAF) will take lead on the development execution of the proposed NFT marketplace with alignment with 1inch architecture and BE team. BAF has been a Web3 industry leader for years with a team of more than 500 employees, including 100+ experienced blockchain developers. They have launched over 200 innovative Web3 business applications for clients across the globe.\n\n***\n*Information regarding  **Vendor team skills** and **Ongoing operational costs post development** can be seen in the original forum post.*\n***\n**Final approval for features delivered under this proposal for the NFT Marketplace will be by the 1inch DAO**",

      "title": "[1IP-20] 1INCH Fast Track Proposal",
      "content": "**Authors:** @Bobby_StableLab , @Kene_StableLab\n**References** [1inch governance process](https://gov.1inch.io/t/1inch-dao-governance-process/1973/7)\n\n## Simple Summary\n1IP-XX introduces an alternative streamlined governance process to be used in an emergency, termed “Fast-Track Proposal”. Fast-track proposals will have a lifecycle of 72 hours due to the nature of the proposal.\n\n## Abstract\nAs 1inch DAO further decentralizes, a fast-track process will be necessary to address emergencies. These fast-track proposals will enable the DAO to take immediate action; instead of relying on the standard governance process.  \n1IP-XX outlines the domains or situations that permit a fast-track proposal and its scope to prevent malicious abuse.\n\n## Motivation\nThere will be emergencies where we will need to perform an urgent vote for the sake of the DAO. The existing [Snapshot + Safesnap proposal lifecycle](https://docs.1inch.io/docs/governance/overview) takes a minimum of 18 days, which makes rapid responses impossible. \n\n#### Specification\n\n1. Fast-track process\n2. Scope of the fast-track process\n3. Governance Council \n\n#### Fast-track Process\n\n1. Governance Thread for 24 hours\n2. Snapshot Vote for 48 hours \n\nImplementing a fast-track proposal would decrease the time to pass a proposal from 8 days to 3 days.\n\nTo indicate a fast-track proposal, community members will have to insert “[Fast-Track]” into the title of a proposal i.e., “[Fast-Track] 1IP-20: Deploy 1INCH on BASE”. This is to alert community members about the nature of the proposal. This will also introduce a new tag to the 1inch forum, “Fast-Track” to keep track of all fast-track proposals.\n\n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreif45yp27e35vuy6vk56mbjpmlinlhju6ak3ed5nnqx3f7g7g6yhoq)\n    \n\n#### Scope of the fast-track process\nThis process can be utilized under the following circumstances.\n\n1. Deploying 1INCH on new networks\n2. Changes to the Governance Process i.e. Adding abstain, raising or decreasing quorum, adding a new gov process.\n3. Changes surrounding the 1inch resolver \n\n#### Whitelisted addresses \nDue to the low governance participation in 1inch DAO, introducing a fast-track process can open the DAO to certain vulnerabilities. Malicious actors can take advantage of the fast-track process, so we recommend forming a public list of whitelisted addresses that are allowed to propose fast-track proposals.\nThese addresses/individuals will be on the forums.\nWe believe that the following community members should be on the initial whitelist:\n\n* RoundElephant:0x824732D3F4Eb94a20254cca9DE10485Ce445Bb40\n* Natalia: 0x94B85505Dd701f522cDA4F1e7Ea4bA855eef24bf\n*  StableLab: 0xea172676E4105e92Cc52DBf45fD93b274eC96676\n*DAOplomats: [Dmat-defi.pod.xyz](https://gov.1inch.io/discussion/Dmat-defi.pod.xyz)\n\nDue to its swift nature, these votes could go unnoticed; therefore, we must have a fast-track whitelist in place to prevent damaging behavior.\n\n#### How to add whitelisted addresses:\nFor a new address to be whitelisted, an already whitelisted address must nominate the new addresses. This nomination would be done in a forum post, and subsequently, go through the 1inch DAO Governance Process, and finally go to a governance vote to determine if the address or addresses should be whitelisted.\n\n#### SnapShot Subspace\nTo facilitate the fast-track process, 1inch DAO will need to set up a separate snapshot subspace. This is necessary because this snapshot currently does not allow for different lengths for different proposals.\nThe newly created snapshot subspace would have a shorter voting period of 2 days.\n \n#### Implementation\nThis is how the fast-track proposal would look in practice:\n\n1. Whitelisted member post a fast-track proposal on the 1inch forum with “[Fast-Track]” in the title\n2. Any non-whitelisted members who post a fast-track proposal to Snapshot, will have their proposals taken down.\n3. After 24 hours, it will move forward to SnapShot.\n4. 1inch token holders will now vote on a proposal via SnapShot. \n\n## Rationale\nEvery DAO needs a fast-track proposal process to cater to processes which require timely intervention; 1inch’s Governance process would require a large amount of time from discussion to voting duration to cater to an emergency. As the 1inch protocol decentralizes, the community needs this fast-track process to address time-sensitive emergencies.\n\n",

All ten resolvers will be able to participate in every stage of the Dutch auction.\n\n\n\n# Motivation\n\nCurrently, only the top five resolvers, ranked according to their Unicorn Power, are able to fill orders during the first four minutes of the Dutch auction. This proposal will increase this number of whitelisted resolvers from five to ten — this will improve competition.\n\n\n\n# Specification \n\nThis proposal serves as a signal from the 1inch Network DAO to 1inch Labs. Once passed, the 1inch Network DAO calls for 1inch Labs to increase the number of whitelisted Fusion mode resolvers from five (5) to ten (10).\n\n\n\n# Rationale\n\n**User benefits:** This proposal aims to increase the resolver competition, offering users better rates. \n\n\n\n**Resolver benefits:** This proposal aims to make becoming a Fusion mode resolver more attractive, as it reduces the individual capital requirements.\n\n\n\n# Considerations\n\n1inch Fusion mode has already been audited and deployed. This proposal will have no negative security implications as it will only change the amount of participants in the first four minutes of the Dutch auction.",

      "title": "[1IP-18] 1inch Analytics Dashboard",
      "content": "# Summary\n\nWe propose to build a dedicated analytics dashboard for the 1inch ecosystem, allowing users to analyze the protocol's main KPIs, activity, treasury, and token related metrics. This proposal is coming along after several meetings with 1inch core team. We determined the requirements scope and technical design together.\n\n# Abstract\n\nThe dashboard will allow anyone in the community to browse the protocol's treasury, KPIs, token metrics, and transactions. The dashboard will initially support the following chains:\n\n- Ethereum\n- Polygon\n- Avalanche\n- Arbitrum\n- Optimism\n- BSC Dashboard will be served on a dedicated web app.\n\n# Motivation\n\n- Make the protocol's key information as accessible and transparent as possible.\n- Help governance and users with decision-making.\n- Provide more thorough information than currently available on Dune (i.e breakdown per user, search tooling)\n\n# Specification\n\nThis dashboard will be built using the Dune API as a data source. Data from Dune will then be indexed on an intermediate database for easy and quick access. We propose to create the following subsections for the dashboard:\n\n### Homepage (Protocol KPIs)\n\nThe UI would be somewhat similar to this: [https://info.notional.finance/](https://info.notional.finance/)\n\n- Users\n- DAU, WAU, MAU\n- Cumulative user count\n- Transactions\n- Daily, weekly and month trade count\n- Breakdown of the number of trades per DEX\n- Volume\n- Daily volume, weekly volume, monthly volume\n- Average trade size (daily, weekly, monthly)\n- Median trade size (daily, weekly, monthly)\n- Volume by underlying liquidity source\n\n### 1inch Fusion\n\n- 1inch Fusion KPIs\n- Total orders, volume, unique users (current + historical)\n- Latest and top transactions\n- Explore and compare resolvers\n- Search by address\n- Compare and access all resolvers in a leaderboard view - Sort by unicorn power, staked 1Inch, all-time fees, total orders, …\n- Breakdown per resolver (Total orders and volume, Historical orders and volume, Historical fees, Staked 1inch / unicorn power / lockout period)\n\n### Treasury\n\nThe UI would be somewhat similar to this: [https://info.notional.finance/treasury](https://info.notional.finance/treasury)\n\n- Protocol treasury balances per token.\n- Cumulative treasury revenue over time (per token type)\n- List of recent treasury transactions\n- Protocol revenues (daily/weekly/monthly)\n- Revenue as a percentage of volume (daily/weekly/monthly)\n\n### 1INCH/st1INCH token section\n\nThe UI would be somewhat similar to this: [https://info.notional.finance/note-token](https://info.notional.finance/note-token)\n\n- Token price over time\n- Token unlock supply schedule over time\n- TVL\n- Amount of staked 1INCH (st1INCH) over time\n- Staking rewards\n\n### Recent Transactions\n\nThe UI would be somewhat similar to this: [https://info.notional.finance/transactions](https://info.notional.finance/transactions)\n\n- List of recent transactions (tx amount, user, main liquidity source, link to etherscan)\n- Filter for a given account\n\n### Transaction gas cost estimate\n\nSimilar to what we show on the left side of the screen here: [https://info.notional.finance/](https://info.notional.finance/)\n\n- Estimated gas cost in USD\n- Gas price in GWEI chart\n- ETH price Hosting and maintenance of the web app will be provided by the Shippooor team.\n\n# Rationale\n\nDune analytics is the current solution for surfacing most of that information.  Due to technical limitations, Dune does not allow surfacing per-user information and does not provide useful search features. Also, in general, Dune dashboards have a hard time getting the reach they deserve. Not only the information is often non-trivial to understand. but the dashboards themselves are hard to find.  1 Inch Dune account: [https://dune.com/1inch](https://dune.com/1inch) Important Dune Dashboards: [https://dune.com/1inch/main](https://dune.com/1inch/main) [https://dune.com/1inch/fusion](https://dune.com/1inch/fusion)\n\n# Considerations\n\n### Hosting and Maintenance\n\nWebsite will be hosted through 1inch subdomain (i.e info.1inch.io) Shippooor commits to 1 year maintenance. Will be renewed through governance afterward. Code will be open sourced.\n\n### Costs\n\nDune API integration work & intermediary database - $35k\n\n- Identify and expose all existing Dune queries that will provide data (historical volume, DAU, transactions, protoco, 1inch token)\n- Write new Dune queries for missing data (i.e breakdown per resolver, treasury balances/historical data)\n- Implement cron workers that will sync all Dune queries with DB through Dune API\n- Convert Dune data structures to fit DB's model\n- Design and implement a relational model that will allow to quickly query and filter the data (wallets, transactions, 1inch fusion resolvers, treasury portfolios, historical data, etc.)\n- Design and implement a production setup on AWS (or other cloud provider if needed) supporting all of the above + CI/CD. Likely going to be Amplify + Postgres on RDS\n- Setup logging and alert to help with monitoring Front-end work - $25k\n- Build an API that will serve all of the aforementioned indexed data and will allow filtering/sorting (likely going to be a GQL API with similar structure as subgraphs).\n- Build a NextJS app that will serve all of the views mentioned in specs. Design - $15k\n- Visual design and implementation work for page layouts, charts, tables, filtering, sorting, etc. Maintenance: $10k for year 1\n- Regular infra monitoring and any bug fixing that may occur\n- Minor specification changes\n\n**Total: $85k**\n\n### Payment structure\n\nWe propose to receive $25K upfront and the rest of the grant upon delivery of the dashboard. This way the 1Inch grant program takes minimal financial risk and our compensation is based on the delivery of the dashboard. We are also willing to break down the grant in multiple smaller milestones if necessary.  Receiving address: 0x70cd17186aae48729f12dba63ba5a9abe7b4116d\n\n### Timeline\n\nWe expect to be able to deliver the dashboard within 8-12 weeks from the grant approval date.\n\n### Team\n\nOur team has extensive experience in crypto, finance, and software engineering. As builders, we've completed several projects for notable projects including:\n\n- [Warden - Risk & analytics platform for DeFi](https://www.warden.finance/)\n- [Dune Analytics dashboards for Aave, Euler, Instadapp, and Uniswap](https://dune.com/shippooordao)\n- [Uniswap Data Extractooor](https://www.uniswap.shippooor.xyz/)\n- [Notional analytics dashboard](https://gov.1inch.io/discussion/info.notional.finance)\n- [Euler subgraph](https://thegraph.com/hosted-service/subgraph/euler-xyz/euler-mainnet)",

      "title": "[1IP-17] 1inch DAO Donation to Humanitarian Relief Efforts in Turkiye",
      "content": "**Author**: RoundElephant\n\n\n***\n\n**Disclaimer**: _One of the projects originally listed in this proposal, Ahbap, has ceased the acceptance of donations on Ethereum. Consequently, this proposal has been modified from its original form to exclude the Ahbap donation and now calls for this to be sent to the BanklessDAO’s Turkey Disaster Relief Fund._\n\n***\n\n\n# Summary\n\n\n\nThis proposal calls for 1inch DAO to donate $100,000 USD towards humanitarian relief efforts in response to the [devastating earthquakes that struck Turkiye (Turkey) on February 6th, 2023](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Turkey%E2%80%93Syria_earthquake).\n\n\n\n# Abstract\n\n\n\nThis 1IP proposes a donation of $100,000 from the 1inch DAO treasury towards humanitarian relief efforts responding to the devastating earthquakes that occurred on 6 February 2023 in southern and central Turkey. This donation is intended to help save the lives of the victims who are facing severe shortages of food, shelter, medical supplies, clean water access, electricity supply disruption etc., due to extensive damage caused by these earthquakes.\n\n\n\nThe donation will be split equally between Anka and BanklessDAO Turkey Disaster Relief Fund  -- both projects have been vetted by the Ethereum community and the author.\n\n\n\n# Motivation\n\n\n\nThis proposal seeks to express solidarity with those affected by this tragedy while also providing tangible support for ongoing relief efforts being carried out by non-profit organizations.\n\n\n\nBy donating funds directly to these non-profits we can ensure our contribution will be used effectively where it matters most -- supporting people impacted across Turkiye.\n\n\n\n**BanklessDAO Turkey Disaster Relief Fund** is focused on humanitarian relief for those impacted by the earthquakes. They are thoroughly vetting several NGOs to distribute funds to.\n\n\n\n**Anka** is a crypto relief fund that was created to support the people of Turkiye after the disastrous earthquakes that hit the region. They have over 50 volunteers working on the project including a team located in Turkiye. Anka is committed to transparency and accountability. \n\n\n\n\n\n# Specification\n\n\n\nSend $100,000 of [1inch DAO Treasury](https://app.safe.global/eth:0x7951c7ef839e26F63DA87a42C9a87986507f1c07/balances) funds to the following causes:\n\n* $50,000 in USDC to [BanklessDAO's Turkey Relief Fund](https://giveth.io/project/banklessdao-turkey-disaster-relief-fund)\n\n    * Ethereum (ERC20) Address --  [0x924393EA45dA424643C89f99BfDFd707b1Fed9AE](https://etherscan.io/address/0x924393EA45dA424643C89f99BfDFd707b1Fed9AE)\n\n* $50,000 in USDC to [Anka](https://ankarelief.org/)\n\n    * Ethereum (ERC20) Address -- [0xCE4d5B5933B369e9c937ffCfBB9e3aeb3d2c265B](https://etherscan.io/address/0xCE4d5B5933B369e9c937ffCfBB9e3aeb3d2c265B)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Rationale\n\n\n\nGiven current estimates of over 20,000 fatalities, over 70,000 severe injuries, and several million displaced — there is an urgent need for immediate assistance. The faster we act, the more lives we potentially save. \n\n\n\n\n\nThe donation must be made on-chain so that the funds can trustlessly be spent via a DAO vote. \n\n\n\n# Considerations\n\n\n\nFrom a security standpoint, there are no major implications associated with this proposal other than verifying that the Safesnap transaction data is correct. \n\n\n\nThough Syria was also affected by the earthquake, it is currently under international sanctions and has been omitted from this proposal. All funds will go to humanitarian efforts Turkiye.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

      "content": "Author: [@Bobbay_](https://gov.1inch.io/u/bobbay_stablenode)StableLab\n\nReferences\n----------\n\n[Governance process](https://gov.1inch.io/t/1inch-dao-governance-process/1973)\n\n[Hop example](https://forum.hop.exchange/t/temperature-check-should-hop-governance-fund-bounties-on-successful-proposals/340)\n\n[Idle Finance example](https://gov.idle.finance/t/idle-dao-governance-mining/990)\n\n[MakerDAO](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/off-chain-proposal-bounties/15363)\n\n[1inch on layer 3](https://beta.layer3.xyz/contests/1inch-dao-governance-proposals)\n\nIntroduction\n------------\n\nTo boost governance activity on 1inch, we would like to incentivize community members to present proposals and receive rewards. \n\nMotivation\n----------\n\nAn active governance culture is an essential aspect of every DAO's operations. Active governance means that the community is dedicated to improving the protocol's operations, which builds a culture of iteration around the protocol. However, governance work is continuously under or unpaid, making it an unattractive role.\n\nBy incentivizing an active governance culture at 1inch, we can attract participants to become more involved in 1inch DAO, thus enabling more opportunities for 1INCH to decentralize. 1INCH DAO tried a similar program last year using[ Layer 3](https://beta.layer3.xyz/), which was successful in attracting participants. \n\nSpecification\n-------------\n\nContents\n\n1.  Aims\n\n2.  Allocation\n\n3.  Eligibility \n\n1.  Eligible Proposals\n\n2.  Ineligible Proposals\n\n5.  Eligible Recipients \n\n6.  Distribution\n\n7.  Administration\n\n8.  Accountability \n\n9.  Reflection\n\n### Aims\n\n1INCH governance is still somewhat inactive, and in these current market conditions, it is even harder to attract governance participation. We hope some form of incentive will attract users to engage with the 1inch DAO.\n\nWe would like to present this program for 6 months at a total cost of 6,000 USDC.\n\n### Allocation\n\nThis proposal would allocate 6,000 USDC to a newly-made community multi-sig. Each successful proposal would receive 500 USDC.  At the end of each month, the community multi-sig will distribute rewards to the eligible authors. This is to reduce the unnecessary cost to the DAO.\n\nThis would incentivize a total of 12 proposals across 6 months.\n\nSince 1INCH earns protocol revenue in USDC, it is easier to distribute governance rewards in USDC. If all USDC is distributed, this would cost the DAO 6,000 USDC for 6 months. \n\n### Eligibility \n\n### Eligible Proposals\n\nAll proposals that follow the outlined [governance workflow](https://gov.1inch.io/t/1inch-dao-governance-process/1973) within 1inch DAO and successfully pass Phase 4.\n\n### Ineligible Proposals\n\n1.  Proposals requesting budgets or grants are excluded.\n\n1.  Grants are directed to the current [1inch grant program](https://1inch.io/foundation-grant-program/).\n\n3.  Proposals making minimal amendments to previous proposals (e.g. fixing only typos) are excluded from this program.\n\n4.  Proposals that have no direct, actionable outcome (e.g. establishing a mission statement) are excluded from this program.\n\n### Eligible Recipients\n\nThe original authors of a proposal are considered the eligible recipients of the reward. Those who initiate the Snapshot vote will not be eligible for a reward. If there are multiple authors of a proposal, it will be assumed that the reward will be evenly split unless explicitly stated otherwise to the community multi-sig disbursers.\n\n### Multi-sig\n\nMulti-sig address: 0x45e84e10e8E85c583C002A40007D10629EF80fAF\n\nStablelab: 0xea172676E4105e92Cc52DBf45fD93b274eC96676\n\nDAOPlaomats: 0x7C2A118717Acf3C821C584506FA5a080cfa6105C\n\nRoundElephant: 0x824732D3F4Eb94a20254cca9DE10485Ce445Bb40\n\nNatalia: 0x94B85505Dd701f522cDA4F1e7Ea4bA855eef24bf\n\n### Distribution\n\n[@RoundElephant](https://gov.1inch.io/u/roundelephant) , Natalia, StableLab and [@DAOplomats.eth](https://gov.1inch.io/u/daoplomats.eth) can form the newly made community multi-sig for these community incentives with a 2/4 signature.\n\nMulti-Sig Address: 0x45e84e10e8E85c583C002A40007D10629EF80fAF\n\nAuthors of a proposal should communicate with community multi-sig signers to provide the correct wallet information for distribution. Wallet information can be communicated in private, but all transactions are public since they are on the blockchain.\n\nDistribution will occur at the beginning of the following month.\n\nStableLab, 1INCH Core Contributors and DAOplaomats will be exempt from this program and will not be eligible to receive any rewards.\n\n### Administration\n\n1.  StableLab provides a monthly update of eligible proposals at the end of each month.\n\n2.  Community multi-sig distributes funds in the first week of the following month.\n\n3.  Any unspent funds at the end of 6 months will be sent back to the 1inch DAO treasury.\n\n### Accountability\n\nStableLab,DAOPlaomats, Jordan and Natalia will document a public record on the forum of all successful proposals providing the following information:\n\n1.  Link to Proposal\n\n2.  Summary of Proposal\n\n3.  Authors\n\n4.  Transaction Payments\n\nThis will help us review this proposal and consider whether 1INCH DAO should continue to provide governance incentives or pause the program.\n\n### Reflection\n\nThe community can review these governance incentives after 6 months to evaluate their success and whether to let it continue or pause the program.\n\nNext Steps\n----------\n\n1.  Temperature check with a poll on the forum\n\n2.  Move to a SnapShot poll\n\n[Yes]: Move forward with this program\n[No]: Do not implement this program\n[Abstain]\n\n1.  If this proposal passes the following will happen:\n6,000 USDC will be transferred to 0x45e84e10e8E85c583C002A40007D10629EF80fAF",

      "content": "Author:  @DAOplomats.eth \n\n#Simple Summary\n\nThis proposal aims to add an \"Abstain\" option in the 1inch DAO governance process, allowing members to abstain from voting.\n\n#Abstract\n\nThis proposal aims to add Adding the abstain option, in addition to “Yes” and “No”, allowing voters and delegates to participate in voting without having to take a side.\n\nMotivation\n\nThe current governance process of the 1inch DAO only allows members to vote Yes or No on proposals. This system can be limiting as it does not allow members to express their opinions accurately, particularly if they are unsure of the consequences of a proposal or do not have enough information to make a decision. Adding an Abstain option to the voting process will allow members to express their views more accurately and increase the overall transparency of the governance process.\n\n\nSpecification\n\nUnder the current governance process, the voting options are limited to ‘Yes’ or ‘No’\n\nIf this proposal is successfully implemented, the following changes will be reflected. \n\n![image](ipfs://bafkreiefyjyjslrj5rxcnbbokkkv3cymvl4vxcpy6sreilwalfzlpmgrpy)\n    \n\nProposed Changes \n\n\n|| During this period, addresses with voting power may vote for, against or abstain from voting on the proposal using the same three voting options as the Phase-3 poll:\n\n* (Yes) In favour of this proposal.\n\n* (No) Against this proposal.|| \n\n* (Abstain) Neither In favour nor Against\n\n\nThe Abstain Button is expected to be used in the following cases \n\n    Neutrality: The Abstain option allows members to remain neutral on a proposal and not take a stance, which can be useful when members are unsure of the proposal's consequences or do not have enough information to decide\n    Higher Conflict of interest:  As part of proposal hygiene, Authors of the proposals tend to abstain from voting on their proposals even though they act in the best interest of the DAO. Furthermore, Voters tend to abstain from voting if there is a high conflict of interests as a voter and the proposed implications. \n     Insufficient information: In case a proposal is moved to snapshot with insufficient information or data, a voter can choose to abstain, thus signalling their unwillingness to decide without further information or discussion\n\n\nThe proposed changes will impact any existing quorums or the requirement to pass a proposal.  \n\n\nRationale\n\n\nThis proposal aims to encourage members to participate in the voting process, which may have otherwise not participated due to a lack of clear stance on a proposal.\n\n\nConsiderations\n\nThere are no security implications with this proposal. \n\nOnce passed, the 1IPs should include ‘Abstain’ as a voting option \n\nThe Governance Doc of 1inch DAO should be updated through a GitHub pull request to update the changes ",

      "content": "\n## Simple Summary\n\n\n\nThis proposal seeks to modify the 1inch DAO governance process to allow st1INCH(v2) holders to vote on 1inch DAO Snapshot proposals. \n\n\n\n## Abstract\n\n\n\nIf passed, this proposal will allow st1INCH(v2) holders to participate in 1inch DAO Snapshot votes. \n\n\n\nLegacy st1INCH and v1INCH will have unchanged voting weights.\n\n\n\n## Motivation\n\n\n\nWith the passing of [[1IP-11] 1inch Staking Pods](https://snapshot.org/#/1inch.eth/proposal/0xece08908c3e10e5125557bc52caac70e5cdc862c391bf02f870da9d1bcc40542), and the subsequent launch of 1inch Fusion mode, st1INCH(v2) has become the primary utility token of 1inch Network. In recent weeks, st1INCH(v2) has overtaken legacy st1INCH in terms of supply. \n\n\n\nThis proposal will enfranchise st1INCH(v2) holders and should increase the number of active participants in the 1inch DAO.\n\n\n\n## Specification \n\n\n\nThe [1inch Network Snapshot space](https://snapshot.org/#/1inch.eth) will be updated to account for st1INCH(v2) voting power. Meaning, st1INCH (v2) will be added as a new “strategy” with equal voting weight to legacy st1INCH. Holders would then be able to use their respective voting weights when participating in votes on proposals. \n\n\n\n### Token Contracts\n\n\n\n* st1INCH (v2): [0x9A0C8Ff858d273f57072D714bca7411D717501D7](https://etherscan.io/token/0x9a0c8ff858d273f57072d714bca7411d717501d7)\n\n* st1INCH (legacy): [0xA0446D8804611944F1B527eCD37d7dcbE442caba](https://etherscan.io/token/0xa0446d8804611944f1b527ecd37d7dcbe442caba)\n\n\n\n## Rationale\n\n\n\nV2 stakers have demonstrated commitment to the 1inch Network and deserve an equal say in how the protocol is governed. By introducing this class of voters, we can better reflect community sentiment while ensuring that those with vested interests remain incentivized towards long-term success of the network.\n\n\n\nLegacy st1INCH will retain its voting power for the time being. It is expected that the DAO will vote to deprecate legacy st1INCH voting rights in the coming months as more of the stake migrates to the new contracts. \n\n\n\n## Considerations\n\n\n\nThere are no security implications with this proposal. \n\n\n\nOnce passed, the [reality.eth proposal acceptance criteria](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmbNkL7ZpUsP2w7m1bCimkPKqJeSyUxM2K4VkxbaFB8ek5) will need to be updated to reflect the change.

      "content": "Author: Bobbay_StableNode\n\nReferences\n\n[1inch governance process](https://gov.1inch.io/t/1inch-dao-governance-process/1973/7)\n\nSimple Summary\n--------------\n\n1IP-13 \"Governance Process Improvements\" introduces changes to the current governance process to create a more agile yet robust process.\n\nAbstract\n--------\n\nIt takes around 12 days to implement a change via governance. This is time-consuming, especially since there is no express pathway to execute proposals in time-sensitive situations.\n\n1IP-13 will reduce the current governance timeline in different ways to ensure that governance changes can be enacted swiftly without compromising security. \n\nMotivation\n----------\n\nThe current 1inch governance framework is far too long, which can hinder the DAOs ability to execute quickly.\n\nSpecification\n-------------\n\n1.  Current Process\n2.  Amendments\n3.  New Process\n\nCurrent Process\n\nThe current process can be found [here](https://gov.1inch.io/t/1inch-dao-governance-process/1973), but here is a summary.\n\nPhase 1 (Discussion) & Phase 2 (1IP formalization) have an open-ended duration, so they have no specific deadline.\n\nPhase 3 (temperature check) lasts five days. Proposals stay unchanged in this phase.\n\nPhase 4 (Snapshot Vote) lasts seven days.\n\nPhase 5 (Implementation) lasts a minimum of six days - This can be ignored since it does not involve the community.\n\nThis means that the current governance process (ignoring phase 5) totals a minimum of 12 days to pass a proposal.\n\nAmendments\n\nWe recommend the following amendments:\n\n-   Phase 3 -  Reduce from five days to three days.\n-   Phase 4  - Reduce from seven days to five days\n\nThese changes ensure enough time to cast a forum and snapshot vote without compromising security. Across other DAOs, having a Snapshot vote last around five days is common practice. It provides a grey area between 3 days (too short) and 7 days (too long).\n\nNew Process\n\n-   Phase 1 & Phase 2  - Open-ended\n-   Phase 3 -  Lasts three days\n-   Phase 4  - Lasts five days\n-   Phase 5 - Lasts seven days\n\nThis new governance process (ignoring phase 5) totals a minimum of 8 days to pass a proposal instead of the original 12 days.\n\nRationale\n---------\n\nThe lengthy process has hindered the DAOs' ability to execute promptly in the past. This reduction will still ensure a suitable amount of time for DAO members to participate in the DAO without sacrificing security. \n\nConsiderations\n\nThis will make it easier for the DAO to pass proposals that could open a security risk to malicious actors.\n\nNext Steps\n----------\n\n1.  Discuss the Proposal\n2.  Forum temperature check\n3.  Move it to a vote\n    1.  [Yes]: Implement these governance changes\n    2.  [No]: Do not implement these governance changes",

      "content": "\n## Simple Summary\nThis proposal seeks to modify 1inch Fusion to allow all five of the top resolvers to fill orders during the entire duration of the Dutch Auction.\n\n## Abstract\nIf passed, this proposal will change the way that 1inch Fusion orders are filled by allowing all five resolvers to participate in every stage of the Dutch auction. This change will increase competition amongst resolvers and ensure that users are getting the best rates. \n\n## Motivation\nCurrently, the top five resolvers are given fill priority according to their Unicorn Power. For the first minute of the Dutch auction, only the resolver with the highest Unicorn Power can fill the order. Then, the resolver with the second most Unicorn Power joins them for the second minute, and so forth... This proposal will foster a more competitive auction by giving all resolvers equal priority.\n\nThis proposal aims to increase competition amongst resolvers and thus provide better rates for users when they make swaps via the 1inch Network. \n\n## Specification \nThis proposal serves as a signal from the 1inch Network DAO to 1inch Labs. Once passed, the 1inch Network DAO calls for 1inch Labs to modify the Fusion logic to allow all five resolvers to participate in every stage of the Dutch auction.\n\n\n![](https://commonwealth-uploads.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/b073b75d-dd10-43b3-a412-0c4cf34291eb.1673961561035)\n\nAbove is the existing Fusion auction order structure. \n\nBelow is the modified Fusion auction order structure that this proposal calls for.\n\n![](https://commonwealth-uploads.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/2b41ffab-c2e6-4b18-b864-e97d73719f7e.1673961577666)\n\n## Rationale\nAllowing for pure competition amongst the five resolvers, rather than giving preferential access based on staking power, will facilitate better swap rates and faster execution times. \n\nThis change will also make it more attractive for professional market makers to become resolvers, which may lead to a greater demand for 1INCH token as they accumulate the necessary Unicorn Power.\n\n## Considerations\n1inch Fusion mode has already been audited and deployed. This proposal will have no negative security implications as it will only change the structure of the Dutch auction.\n\nAn increase in the number of resolvers participating in the Fusion auctions should reduce the likelihood of resolver collusion.",

      "title": " [1IP-11] 1inch Staking Pods",
      "content": "Author: [@Bobbay_stablenode](https://gov.1inch.io/u/bobbay_stablenode)\n\nReferences:\n\n[GitHub - 1inch/erc20-pods 7](https://github.com/1inch/erc20-pods),\n[GitHub - 1inch/farming 5](https://github.com/1inch/farming),\n[GitHub - 1inch/delegating 1](https://github.com/1inch/delegating)\n\nSimple Summary\n--------------\n\nThis proposal seeks to implement a new Staking Pod mechanic for the 1INCH token. This system will consist of:\n\n-   Incentivised time-locked 1INCH staking\n-   Permissionless delegation pods\n-   Reward distribution compatibility\n-   50% of all current, and future, 1inch DAO protocol revenue shall be distributed to stakers\n\nAbstract\n--------\n\nWith the Staking Pod system, users lock their 1INCH tokens in a staking contract to get st1INCH tokens --- the longer the lock period, the more st1INCH tokens the user gets. st1INCH tokens can be used by stakers for 1inch DAO governance, and the 1inch DAO can choose to use these token balances for reward distribution. The system is modular as anyone can launch a new Modular Delegation Pod and can use the reward functionality to incentivize certain actions and/or assign utility to the 1INCH token. 50% of all current, and future, 1inch DAO revenue shall be distributed to stakers.\n\nMotivation\n----------\n\n1INCH token is the governance token of the 1inch Network. It provides voting rights within the 1inch DAO's governance system, and users can stake it to receive a [refund 3](https://blog.1inch.io/the-extended-gas-refund-program-is-now-available-to-yet-more-users-1d48de21aae3) on their transaction fees. However, despite these functions, the amount of 1INCH tokens currently being held in [staking contracts is quite low](https://etherscan.io/token/0xa0446d8804611944f1b527ecd37d7dcbe442caba) and governance participation is even lower. We believe that this is due to a lack of incentives to participate in governance and a lack of additional utility for staked 1INCH.\n\nBy introducing Modular Staking Pods, we hope to give stakers more direct control over how their stake is used to power the 1inch Network. This change will allow them to independently select how their stake governs each of the protocols and will allow for rewards to permissionlessly be distributed based on the actions of the stakers. We envision that this will improve the goverance by aligning incentives between people who want to stake to earn rewards and those who are interested in protocol governance -- both players will have direct incentives to participate in the same system.\n\nWe believe that this proposal represents a step forward for the 1inch Network and that it will help increase adoption and usage of the network's future protocols.\n\nSpecification\n-------------\n\n![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/zPUYe5xnZHso9tGiOtK8kd_x7gLlqzORn7i-ybtqHGOlfHGQ2aP-7SS5aBvePY24anio_5v-UkG-v0E2hTL4FrQCZmyO_y6zon72z344BhOLuPwLjxFhMsQhwNlLqx-01hMcGOCpJBp7-x7KNWYgpZWt5dy08aO_w4qf2Wowr-pyyHkA35mhKx8z0cJG_A)\n\n### Staking\n\nLike the existing 1INCH staking contract, users will be able to lock their 1INCH tokens in the staking contract to get st1INCH tokens that can be used for 1inch DAO governance. However, unlike the current system, Modular Staking will require users to lock their 1INCH for a set amount of time.\n\n### Locking\n\nThe minimum and maximum lock periods are chosen by the DAO through --- for the purposes of analysis, we'll use 1 month and 2 years as the minimum and maximum staking periods respectively. st1INCH tokens grant users \"voting power\" which they can use for various use cases. The longer the locking period the more \"voting power\" resolver can get. However, the increase in power is not linear.\n\n![telegram-cloud-photo-size-2-5255863446073885266-y](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/0BNAE7QLhaYsfh_V-YuVPJtaMxt6FxxOrcFf1eU8fDESZU8cGVzjuh7slAgUsEc9ZvvQEGYHVIPbZz25i-kCpsVZ2JLALFFR6MdcBbqsc9S9t9gPK2Jj1olh_Hq0TFuX6dA9VhX4tW4d7cNXG1TrQHi4ZXXC_mhjtTCKZMKguPkhehfa5VA0RSFJPsV_kg)\n\nThere will be a minimum locking period of 1 month.\n\nNote that st1INCH voting power will decay over time according to the locking curve. Also note that users can re-lock their stake at any time to refresh their st1INCH balance. Users will be able to withdraw their stake early but will forfeit a portion of their rewards.\n\n![telegram-cloud-photo-size-2-5255863446073885267-y](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/W3oNTVwGLKp7lL_x8cDPI2KpPBmyC5EH8_O0Ma0voShuZU6bDM8-GHOUZznp7gKfFj8Y_yCeBEA_HZzjkVhn8iix8MW4XAt7tR7wnOdUnJ7PqfPj2ZarwHpVWCJfDxpVdofa7nxCgVPEElZ61Vv492lXDvmisHoVPZ8cThjDpu7ZJNEigrop94zj6oFuRg)\n\nOrange is the amount lost when a staker withdraws earlier than they originally committed.\n\nExample:\n\n-   In 2023, Sally stakes 100 1INCH and selects a 2-year lock period.\n\n-   They receive 100 st1INCH from the staking contract and this balance decays over time.\n\n-   By 2024 Sally's st1INCH balance has decayed to 22.36\n\n-   Sally then chooses to re-lock her stake for the maximum amount of time, 2-years, and her st1INCH balance is increased to 100.\n\n-   Sally chose not to re-lock, and in 2026, after the lock period, she withdraws her original 100 1INCH.\n\n### Unlocking\n\nIf a st1INCH staker wishes to unlock they will forfeit some of their tokens based on the following equation:\n\nwithdrawalAmount = (balance - votingPower) / 0.9\n\npenalty = balance - withdrawalAmount\n\nIn this setting, the maximum early withdrawal loss is 90% as the minimum locking period is 1 month\n\n### Admin Control\n\nThe 1inch DAO Treasury Address, [0x7951c7ef839e26F63DA87a42C9a87986507f1c07](https://gnosis-safe.io/app/eth:0x7951c7ef839e26F63DA87a42C9a87986507f1c07/balances), would act as admin of the staking contract with control over the following functions:\n\n-   setFeeReceiver -- this would allow the DAO to change the vault to collect the rewards for later distribution between stakers and the DAO treasury.\n\n-   setDefaultFarm -- this would allow the DAO to change the default reward distribution contract for 1INCH staking.\n\n-   setMaxLossRatio -- this would allow the DAO to change the earliest point at which people can early withdraw their stake by disallowing withdrawals with larger withdrawal fees.\n\n-   setEmergencyExit -- This is basically an abort function and would allow the DAO to end the staking scheme. All stakers can reclaim the entire amount of their original stake regardless of their remaining locking period. This would be used if the DAO wanted to migrate to a new staking contract to change key variables, like the maximum lock period.\n\n### Modular Delegation\n\nThe Modular Delegation system provides users with a set of delegation contracts that are specific to a topic. The set of delegation contracts is permissionless, meaning that anyone can deploy one and allow users to delegate their st1INCH within it.\n\nThe 1inch DAO will have the power to endorse a delegation contract and feature it in the 1inch staking UI.\n\nFor the start, we propose just two delegation topics:\n\n**Snapshot governance delegation**\n-   This will allow users to delegate their Snapshot voting power to a recognized delegate from the UI, or manually enter an Ethereum/ENS address.\n-   Nested within this is the vanilla[ Snapshot space-specific delegation contract 1](https://docs.snapshot.org/guides/delegation).\n\n**st1INCH utility delegation**\n\n-   As part of this staking upgrade, there will be a new protocol added to 1inch's suite of DeFi tools that will substantially improve the utility of st1INCH.\n-   Service providers that want to tap into the utility of st1INCH can proposition the community for delegated power.\n\n### Rewards\n\nModular Staking will have two levels of reward functionality: Generic st1INCH rewards and Modular Delegation rewards.\n\n#### Generic st1INCH rewards\n\nThe st1INCH contract will allow anyone to run a farm to distribute rewards to everyone holding st1INCH tokens.  \n\nUsers also have the ability to to join as many farms as they want as it does not required a user to move their st1inch to a specific farm. Along as a user holds st1inch in their account, they can receive rewards from multiple farms.\n\nThis proposal calls for 50% of all current, and future, 1inch DAO revenue to be distributed to stakers in the form of 1INCH.\n\n#### Modular Delegation rewards\n\nSome Modular Delegation contracts have  an integrated rewards function that anyone can run a farm atop.\n\nThe main advantage to this type of reward is that it is not limited to being proportional to a user's st1INCH holdings. Any action, onchain or offchain, can be used as the basis of reward distribution. This functionality could be used by the 1inch DAO to incentivize anything from editing 1IPs to using a new 1inch protocol (and everything in between).\n\nExample: The 1inch DAO may use the Snapshot governance delegation contract to incentivize active governance participation by boosting the st1INCH rewards of people who vote on proposals, delegate their st1INCH to active voters, etc...\n\nRationale\n---------\n\nThe rationale for this proposal is to provide a more flexible staking system that can be used to incentivize various activities within the 1inch Network. The new Modular Delegation contracts will allow for rewards to be distributed based on anything from voting on proposals to using new 1inch protocols. This will provide a greater incentive for users to participate in the network and help drive adoption of new 1inch products and services.\n\nConsiderations\n--------------\n\nThe security considerations for this proposal are mainly around the potential for abuse of the new staking and delegation contracts. It is important to ensure that there are adequate safeguards in place to prevent users from delegating their voting power to malicious actors.\n\nThe governance considerations for this proposal include the impact on revenue streams and changes to the governance processes. This proposal could potentially increase revenue for the 1inch DAO if it is successful in incentivizing more users to participate in the network. It is also worth considering how these changes will impact existing voting processes within the 1inch DAO since the existing staking contract will be deprecated.",

There is no reason not to claim the tokens, and doing so will add additional assets to the 1inch DAO Treausury.\n\nThis proposal also allows for the 1inch DAO’s interests to be represented in SafeDAO via vote delegation.\n\n## Specification\n\nDelegate Address: `Stablelab.eth` -- [0xea172676E4105e92Cc52DBf45fD93b274eC96676](https://etherscan.io/address/0xea172676e4105e92cc52dbf45fd93b274ec96676)\n***\n\n#### Safesnap Transaction Data:\n```\n[\n\t{\n\t\t\"to\": \"0x469788fE6E9E9681C6ebF3bF78e7Fd26Fc015446\",\n\t\t\"operation\": \"0\",\n\t\t\"value\": \"0.0\",\n\t\t\"data\": \"0xbd86e508736166652e657468000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000ea172676e4105e92cc52dbf45fd93b274ec96676\"\n\t},\n\t{\n\t\t\"to\": \"0xA0b937D5c8E32a80E3a8ed4227CD020221544ee6\",\n\t\t\"operation\": \"0\",\n\t\t\"value\": \"0.0\",\n\t\t\"data\": \"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\"\n\t},\n\t{\n\t\t\"to\": \"0xA0b937D5c8E32a80E3a8ed4227CD020221544ee6\",\n\t\t\"operation\": \"0\",\n\t\t\"value\": \"0.0\",\n\t\t\"data\": \"0x0087b83fcdcd74dcca41c772a2d1bfb8ba75e9c5f44ee4ca1f062385a31b0db14ab55ceb0000000000000000000000007951c7ef839e26f63da87a42c9a87986507f1c0700000000000000000000000000000000ffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff\"\n\t}\n]\n\n```\n\n***\n\n## Rationale\n\nAs part of the [stage-2 governance](https://blog.1inch.io/the-road-to-decentralization-ddee58d3b198) launch, the powers of the 1inch DAO treasury multisig owners are limited to emergency cases only.

      "title": " [1IP-09] Collect 1inch DAO Treasury Revenue in 1INCH Token in Addition to USDC",
      "content": "## Simple Summary\n\nThis proposal seeks to modify the 1inch Network DAO Treasury’s revenue collection strategy by enacting the following changes:\n\n* Switch from buying USDC with Swap Surplus revenue to buying 1INCH when the price is lower than $1.30.\n* Switch from buying 1INCH with Swap Surplus revenue to buying USDC the price of 1INCH is greater than or equal to $1.70.\n\n## Abstract\n\nCurrently, the Swap Surplus [revenue stream](https://docs.1inch.io/docs/governance/dao-treasury#revenue-stream) is collected in varying tokens and swapped to [USDC](https://etherscan.io/token/0xa0b86991c6218b36c1d19d4a2e9eb0ce3606eb48) before it is then sent to the 1inch DAO [Treasury](https://gnosis-safe.io/app/eth:0x7951c7ef839e26F63DA87a42C9a87986507f1c07/transactions/history). Once enacted, this proposal will instead swap these tokens to [1INCH](https://etherscan.io/token/0x111111111117dc0aa78b770fa6a738034120c302) as long as the market price of 1INCH is below the $1.30 to $1.70 range (see the Specification section for a detailed explanation). All swaps will be done using the [1inch Aggregation Protocol](https://docs.1inch.io/docs/aggregation-protocol/introduction) to ensure the best pricing.\n\n## Motivation\n\nBenefits to the 1inch Network DAO include:\n\n* Investing the DAO’s revenue stream into the protocol’s governance token while the governance token is lower than it was previously valued.\n* Potential upward pressure on the 1INCH token as the DAO Treasury will be a net buyer of cheap 1INCH.\n* When the token is trading at higher valuations, the Treasury will automatically de-risk by collecting revenue in stable coins.\n* Holding 1INCH within the 1inch DAO Treasury will allow the Treasury to scale its value with the performance of the token.\n\n## Specification\n\nThis proposal serves as a signal from the 1inch Network DAO to 1inch Labs. Once passed, the 1inch Network DAO calls for 1inch Labs to modify the fee collection strategy with the following changes:\n\n* When the price of 1INCH moves is below $1.30, Swap Surplus revenue shall start to be collected in 1INCH.\n* When the price of 1INCH moves above $1.70, Swap Surplus revenue shall be collected in USDC.\n\nOnce the modifications have been made and tested, 1inch Labs shall deploy them. All future modifications to these will need to be done by a 1inch DAO Governance vote.\n\n## Rationale\n\nThis proposal aims to purchase 1INCH with treasury revenue when the price is lower than ~$1.50. $0.20 bands are used on either side of this buying point in order to dampen the impact that market volatility could have.\n\nThis price point of 1INCH that triggers the switch can be changed in the future via a governance vote.\n\n## Considerations\n\n### Market Risk\n\nThe USDC stablecoin composition of the 1inch DAO Treasury puts the Treasury in a very good position during any bearish market cycles — the Treasury constantly grows in dollar value while, in contrast, projects that primarily hold their own token, have had the real value of their Treasury shrink in the last 6 months.\n\nAdding 1INCH to the Treasury composition will increase both the potential risk and potential returns. This proposal dampens the volatility by maintaining a mix of risk-on and risk-off assets.\n\n### Added Complexity\n\nIf enacted, this proposal will add complexity to the Treasury Revenue collection strategy.",

      "title": "[1IP-08] Simple diversification mechanism for 1inch DAO Treasury",
      "content": "## Simple Summary\n\nThis proposal seeks to diversify the 1inch Network DAO’s Treasury composition be enacting the following strategy:\n\n* Do not exchange a whitelisted set of tokens for USDC before sending to the 1inch DAO Treasury.\n* These whitelisted tokens shall be: ETH, WETH, WBTC, DAI, and USDT.\n\n## Abstract\n\nCurrently, all of the Swap Surplus revenue stream is collected in varying tokens and swapped to USDC before being sent to the 1inch DAO Treasury. To start the diversification process of the treasury funds, the protocol can keep some incoming Swap Surplus tokens as collected (not swapping them for USDC).\n\nThis proposal aims to whitelist the following tokens for this treasury collection strategy:\n\n* ETH\n* WETH\n* WBTC\n* DAI\n* USDT\n\n## Motivation\n\nThe 1inch DAO Treasury is 100% composed of USDC. USDC is a fiat-backed stablecoin pegged to USD managed by Circle.\n\nUSD experienced record inflation over the last 12 months, and will experience some degree of inflation for perpetuity. As such, the marginal spending power of the 1inch DAO Treasury is weakened unless the DAO deploys the funds in a manner that can outpace inflation.\n\nThese assets are viewed as risk-on diversification assets for the treasury:\n\n* ETH – the native asset of the Ethereum blockchain\n* WETH – ETH wrapped in an ERC20 wrapper\n* WBTC – Bitcoin (BTC) is the oldest and largest digital asset. WBTC is Bitcoin wrapped in an ERC20 wrapper\n\nStablecoins also have inherent risks such as smart contract risks and centralization risks. Diversifying the stable coin holdings of the 1inch DAO Treasury aims to hedge against these risks. These assets are viewed as risk-off assets for the treasury:\n\n* DAI – the decentralized collateral-backed stablecoin issued by the Maker Protocol. DAI is soft-pegged to USD\n* USDT – the fiat-backed stablecoin pegged to USD and managed by Tether\n\n## Specification\n\nTo implement this proposal, GovernanceLeftoverExchanger should transfer ETH, WETH, WBTC, DAI and USDT directly to the treasury the same way it transfers USDC. All other tokens should still be converted to USDC as they are now.\n\n## Rationale\n\nThe crypto market cap took a decline in recent months. With token valuations depressed, it may be a good time to start accumulating non-stable tokens to grow the treasury.\n\nSince exchange transactions cost some Ether to pay for the gas fees, eliminating the swapping step for these whitelisted tokens will increase the capital efficiency of this operation. It is also for this reason that large stable coins such as DAI and USDT, should be sent directly to the treasury.\n\n## Considerations\n\nThe current stablecoin composition of the 1inch DAO Treasury ensures that the Treasury is insulated from bearish market cycles. However, this also means the treasury’s funds have no way to keep pace with the rise in inflation. Adding ETH, WETH and WBTC increase both the risk and the potential rewards.\n\nThis proposal does not call for any actions to be taken with the funds currently held by the 1inch DAO Treasury.",

      "title": "[1IP-07] Integrate Balancer Boosted Pools in the 1inch Aggregation Protocol",
      "content": "## Simple Summary\n\nThis proposal calls for the integration of [Balancer Boosted Pools](https://docs.balancer.fi/products/balancer-pools/boosted-pools) into the 1inch Aggregation Protocol.\n\n## Abstract\n\nThis proposal aims to grow the kinds of liquidity sources compatible with the 1inch Aggregation Protocol by integrating Balancer Boosted Pools. To fund this development, a BAL grant from Balancer DAO and Balancer DAO will be awarded to 1inch Labs upon the successful completion of the integration. Specifically, the following\n\n1. 1inch Labs shall integrate the Balancer Boosted Pools into the 1inch smart contracts, the 1inch dApp, and the 1inch API.\n2. The integration shall be live on the Ethereum main-net no later than 3 weeks after this proposal passes the Phase-4 snapshot vote.\n3. If both conditions 1 and 2 are met, Balancer DAO and Balancer DAO will transfer 20k BAL or the equivalent in stablecoins (as determined by Balancer DAO) to 1inch Labs.\n\n## Motivation\n\nBalancer Boosted Pools are a new pool type that have been gaining traction from many DeFi protocols. These pools were previously discussed with the 1inch community on the [1inch Governance Forum](https://gov.1inch.io/t/1inch-balancer-boosted-pools/3012) as well as the [1inch Network DAO Community Call #02](https://youtu.be/OQF0wqgQXDg).\n\nGiven that this is a new pool type and requires effort from 1inch Labs, Balancer seeks to fund this integration via a payment of 20,000 BAL to 1inch Labs.\n\n## Specification\n\nAt a high level, integration of Balancer Boosted Pools would require support for Balancer’s BatchSwap function, the routing of trades through multiple Balancer pools including linear pools nested in the boosted pool and the math in the linear pools. This proposal hopes that the support for Boosted Pools is general and can later be expanded to new future Boosted Pools. The integration of Balancer’s BatchSwap function within the 1inch Network will also be able to be used for pools other than Boosted Pools which would benefit both the 1inch Network and Balancer as it would allow for cheaper execution of trades from the wider Balancer pool types. In the near future we expect to see meta pools created with the BPT of Boosted Pools, an example would be a bbaUSD/WETH pool. Routing trades through such pools would include one or more extra hop through Balancer’s BatchSwap function.\n\nWe expect that there will be many new Boosted Pools across all networks in near future, namely poos in collaboration with Ampleforth and Olympus although, below is a non-exhaustive list of currently live Boosted Pools on Ethereum L1:\n\n1. bbaUSD, containing 300mm of DAI/USDC/USDT TVL\n2. bbfUSD, [expected](https://tribe.fei.money/t/fip-90-fuse-boosted-usd-balancer-pool-bb-f-usd/4023) to contain at least 50mm of FEI/LUSD/DAI\n\nThis is contingent on the same proposal passing through the BalancerDAO.\n\nUpon satisfactory integration <sup>*Note1*</sup>, 20,000 BAL shall be sent to 1inch Labs ETH address:\n\n0x2DF104682A61241C79eBB3ce3b2C293578bF6A9D.\n\n*Note 1*: Satisfactory integration is defined as the 1inch Aggregation Protocol accurately forwarding trades through the bbaUSD and the bbfUSD pools, on Ethereum main-net, when those pools offer the optimal pricing for the end-user.\n\n## Rationale\n\nSupport for the mentioned pools will unlock $350mm of efficient TVL for the 1inch Aggregation Protocol and allow it to have access to cheap liquidity for trade routing at the moment of integration and much more TVL in the future as Boosted Pool continue their adoption. Additionally, Boosted Pools have been adapted by BeethovenX, Balancer’s Friendly Fork on Fantom and, integrating them would provide a good source for volume to 1inch on Fantom as well.\n\nBalancer Boosted Pools are in much demand from other DeFi protocols due to their innovation in capital efficiency thus, it is expected to see many more Balancer Boosted Pools with high TVL in collaboration with other DAOs, some of which were mentioned in the discussion on the forum. Supporting Boosted Pools will position the 1inch aggregator to be able to rapidly integrate any new Boosted Pools launched.\n\nThis BAL grant would be used by 1inch Labs to fund the development of this integration.\n\n## Considerations\n\nThe technical specifics of this integration will be defined by 1inch Labs. Like all new modules they have launched, a complete internal security review and audit should be performed before this change is implemented on main-net.\n\nBecause Balancer DAO is directly funding this integration, other upgrades to the 1inch Network can be made in parallel.",

      "title": "[1IP-06] Donation of 1inch DAO Treasury Funds to support Ukraine’s humanitarian crisis ",
      "content": "## Summary\n\n1inch Network was founded on core values of decentralization and open financial freedom, with a goal of improving the human condition for everyone on the planet. As one of the leading dApps in the DeFi space, it is in a unique position to extend additional assistance to people in a time of need.\n\nWith that said, this proposal seeks to donate 1 million USDC of 1inch DAO Treasury funds to support humanitarian aid within the country of Ukraine.\n\n## Abstract\n\nSince inception just over 3 months ago, the 1inch DAO Treasury has been highly successful in growing its total capital. It has accumulated close to 7 million USDC to date from a steady income stream of swap surplus funds. This proposal aims to donate 1 million USDC of these accumulated funds to provide critical humanitarian support within Ukraine’s conflict zone.\n\nSpecifically, these funds will be converted into USDT via 1inch v4 protocol, then transferred to the official wallet of Ukraine, as outlined [here](https://twitter.com/ukraine/status/1497594592438497282?s=21). These funds will then be distributed as needed to civilians for repairing infrastructure, supporting health facilities with medicine and equipment, and supporting families with food and hygiene items.\n\n## Motivation\n\n1inch Network is a global project which brings together extraordinary minds from all over the world. Both users and contributors alike are negatively affected by the recent war-time events unfolding this week, and it is the absolute duty of 1inch DAO to provide support to civilians within the conflict zone in every way possible.\n\n## Specification\n\n1. Swap 1,000,500 USDC to USDT within multi-sig on [1inch app](https://app.1inch.io/)\n2. Transfer 1,000,000 USDT from 1inch DAO Treasury multi-sig wallet to the official humanitarian wallet of Ukraine\n\n*Due to exchange rates, a slightly higher amount of USDC is required to receive 1,000,000 USDT when swapping*\n\n* 1inch DAO Treasury address: 0x7951c7ef839e26f63da87a42c9a87986507f1c07\n\n* Donation address: 0x165CD37b4C644C2921454429E7F9358d18A45e14\n\n## Rationale\n\nThis donation address has been [verified](https://twitter.com/TomicahTD/status/1497601610775769094) by the crypto community as legitimate, and has been identified as having a direct impact on the humanitarian crisis currently unfolding in Ukraine.\n\n## Considerations\n\nWith the 1inch DAO Treasury’s historical rate of growth, the donation amount of 1 million USDC will have minimal impact on the DAO’s ability to fund future developments of 1inch Network. At the same time, this amount will have a significant impact on the humanitarian relief efforts for Ukraine and its citizens.\n\nFor accountability, a screenshot and link to the transaction will be added to this proposal once the transfer of funds is complete.\n\n*****\n\n[Link to Phase-3 temperature check vote.](https://gov.1inch.io/t/1ip-06-donation-of-1inch-dao-treasury-funds-to-support-ukraine-s-humanitarian-crisis/2966)",

Specifically, it calls for the following additions:\n\n* Aggregation protocol is expanded to include derivatives \n* Add derivative aggregation to the 1inch smart contracts, 1inch dApp, and 1inch API \n* The first derivative supported will be Opium’s TURBO products (call options)\n\n## Abstract\n\nThis proposal aims to signal to the 1inch Foundation that the DAO wants to add derivative aggregation to the 1inch Protocol – specifically, the 1inch smart contracts, the 1inch dApp, and the 1inch API. Adding derivative aggregation to the protocol will require technical effort from 1inch Labs, and will require the support of 1inch Foundation. \n\n## Motivation\n\n1inch is currently the leading decentralized exchange aggregator and has made a reputation of providing the best prices on token swaps. With the rise of derivatives in the DeFi space, there is a new product niche that 1inch is perfectly positioned to capitalize on: **the aggregation of derivative products.** \n\nBy implementing this proposal, 1inch will solve the problem of fractured derivative liquidity (just like it previously solved fractured token liquidity). \n\n## Specification \n\nThis proposal serves as a signal from the 1inch Network DAO to the 1inch Foundation and 1inch Labs. Once passed, the 1inch Network DAO calls for the 1inch Foundation to allot resources to add derivative aggregation to the 1inch Protocol and dApp, and for 1inch Labs to add derivative aggregation to the 1inch smart contracts and 1inch API.\n\nOpium’s TURBO product is a short-dated call option:\n\n* Community / users can “write” covered calls by pooling their tokens in order to earn yield (collect call option premiums)\n* Takers (professional market makers) can buy the call options in order to gain leveraged exposure to the underlying asset\n\nAdding Opium’s TURBO options to the aggregation UI will require coordination with the Opium community to ensure a smooth integration.\n\n## Rationale\n\nThe architecture of the aggregation protocol has not yet been defined. \n\nOpium’s TURBO product was chosen as the first derivative supported because the Opium community was offering to help with this integration via documentation and SDKs.\n\n## Considerations\n\nThe specifics of launching an aggregation protocol will not be defined until the 1inch Foundation supports the proposal.

      "content": "[1IP-3 Forum Post](https://gov.1inch.io/t/1ip-3-formalization-vote-to-make-1inch-deflationary/2103)\n\n## Summary\nImplementing a strong deflationary mechanism to the 1inch token.\n\n## Abstract\nRemoving Single-Asset-Staking & Farming Completely. Replace with a deflationary mechanism.\n\n## Motivation\nThis eliminates sell pressure from the stakers as well, and everybody is incentivised as the supply decreases = more valuable… Holders will be more committed to hold the token, instead of farming/staking and then selling the token, which decreases the value of the token.\n## Specification \nRemoving Single-Asset-Staking & Farming Completely. Replace with a mechanism where users stake $1INCH tokens and get incentivised to access governance + instead of receiving rewards, the stakers will collectively help burn $1INCH tokens (deflationary pool). Deflationary pool which users will stake their $1INCH and will determine the burn speed/rate. Essentially the traditional staking rewards will now go into a deflationary pool and get burnt.\n\n## Benefits\nThe main benefit is that the community basically decides the burn rate, the more people who stake $1inch tokens the more it will be deflationary. If in any case, less people stake, the burn rate will slow down significantly, so it’s continuously up to the 1inch holders for it to be as deflationary as they want it. It empowers holders more, and takes rewards away from “whale” holders. It is evident that most people who stake/farm usually dump the token which currently plays a significant role in the tokens value. With this mechanism, you can have the best of both worlds, making it “stake-to-burn” rewards HOLDERS. It encourages more value to the token.\n\n## Drawbacks\nA potential drawback could be that some people may be upset in regards to removing staking / farming, especially the single asset staking. In the long term this is actually very healthy for the 1inch ecosystem. We need to start building 1inch’s future now. The distribution on 1inch currently in my opinion is successful, very successful in fact. But the staking is really decreasing the token value.\n\nImagine if it was deflationary but still rewarding holders.",

      "content": "[Original 1IP-1 Forum Post](https://gov.1inch.io/t/1ip-1-proposal-1inch-trading-incentives-discount-swap-fee-slippage-subsidies/2004)\n\n## Summary\n\n  * Introducing Exclusive Trading Incentives - Discounts , Swap Fee & Slippage Subsidies\n\n## Abstract\n\n1. Platform Fees Reduction for those who are staking 1inch in the DAO proportional to the amount of tokens that have been staked.\n\n2. Platform Fees Reduction for Achieving Certain Personal Total Trading Volume + Trading milestones on 1inch DEX\n\n## Motivation\n\nThe Feature is used by Many Centralized Exchanges like Binance etc. But when it comes to DEX there's not Much Competition .\n\n1inch DEX on other Hand is one of the Best DEX out there & can take advantage of Such Implementation which will help the Project to move in new directions & Compete against Centralized Exchanges & with other DEX'es as well .\n\n## Specification\n\n1. Platform Fees Reduction for those who are **staking 1inch** in the DAO proportional to the amount of tokens that have been staked [For 1inch Stakers]\n*Note: The exact ratio can be voted on*\n\n#### **Specific example for a 1:1 fee reduction for 1inch staked:**\n\nAnton stakes 2000 1inch tokens in the DAO\n1inch price = $5\n2000 * $5 = $10,000\n\nThis means that Anton has a 100% fee* reduction on trades >= $10,000 in value.\n\n\n2. Platform Fees Reduction for **Achieving a Certain Personal Total Trading Volume + Trading Milestones on 1inch DEX** proportional w.r.t to the 24hr Volume on 1inch DEX [For NON 1inch Stakers ]\n*Note: The exact ratio can be voted on*\n                                                                                                                               \nTrading Milestones will be Dynamic & will depend on the Total Volume Being Traded on 1inch in 24hrs & also on Daily/Weekly/Monthly Trading Frequency of the user .\n\n####  Note - \n\n* Fee Reduction %age is Dynamic & Will increase with the increased Trading Volume of user .\n\n*  Fee Reductions **will not be Permanent** & will start resetting/decreasing gradually once the user completely Stops doing trades on 1inch DEX after a certain period of time .\n\n####   *[ Optional ]*  Discount Generation - \n   * Setting up a Separate Discount Funding Contract [DFC]\n   * Split Referral Rewards & Allocate %age of those Funds that will go to DFC\n   *  Refilling of DFC on Weekly/Daily Basis\n   * Distributing Certain %age of Discounts & Cashbacks out of DFC based on most frequent & most Volume traded users over the Leaderboard .\n\n![48464d3c7ac1bbc95b7e0b46d7a9a65e1fe79d82.jpeg](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard11/uploads/x1inch/original/1X/48464d3c7ac1bbc95b7e0b46d7a9a65e1fe79d82.jpeg)\n\n## Benefits\n\n1. Offers another functionality to the 1inch token.\n2. A new benefit of 1inch token for the user of the platform instead of just those who are governing the platform.\n3. Offers long term price stability due to locking mechanism\n4. New attraction to the 1inch platform as an even cheaper way to trade\n5. More Trading Volume Surge will benefit 1inch Stakers in DAO by providing APY boost as Volume Surges .\n6. More Participation in Governance as more people holding 1inch Tokens\n\n## Drawbacks\n\n##   Sam buys $1,000,000 USDC worth of 1inch tokens\nStakes 1inch in DAO\nMakes many trades quickly to take advantage of fee reduction >= $1,000,000\nUn-stakes 1inch\nSells $1,000,000 USDC worth of 1inch tokens\n\n**Possible Solution**\n\n2 Choices -\n\n- Lock - in : Those who want to take advantage of the fee reduction from staking 1inch in the DAO need to lock in their tokens for a certain time period . \n\n     1.  Hard Lock - in   : Tokens unlocks only after full period ends .\n     2. Liquid Lock - in : Provides flexibility & Tokens Unlock slowly with time .\n\n       Note: The length of time can be voted on\n\n- 1inch LP - If Trader don't Want to Stake they can also Provide Liquidity to Top 5 1inch Liq. Pools\n\n##  Trading Useless Shitcoins for Fee Reduction\n**Possible Solution**\n\nGranting Fee Reduction on Approved Pools & Tokens at 1st & then Gradually opening it to other well known tokens too by Voting etc .\n\n##  Top [$1INCH](https://twitter.com/1inch) holders may have more advantages when collecting Trading Discount than others .\n\n**Possible Solution**\n\nIf you collect discount more than 10% of current DFC allocation  , **30%** of it will be used to buy back [$1INCH](https://twitter.com/1inch) at the market price & Redistribute them immediately to Governance Stakers etc. . This feature helps deflate the supply and increase the price of [$1INCH](https://twitter.com/1inch)  for long-term [$1INCH](https://twitter.com/1inch)  holders.",
