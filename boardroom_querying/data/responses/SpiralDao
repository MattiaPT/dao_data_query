      "content": "**Summary:**\nThe objective of this proposal is to determine whether or not we will allocate our treasury funds to invest in the Turtle DAO seed round.\n\n**Context:**\nTurtle DAO is offering a Smart Money Allocation: 2.5% $TRT allocation for $1 million with 1.5x oversubscription. As part of this allocation, 20% of the $TRT tokens will be unlocked at the Token Generation Event (TGE), followed by a four-month cliff period and the remaining tokens vesting over the course of 12 months. This structured vesting schedule aligns with our agenda of non-exploitative aggregation of assets in the treasury, ensuring long-term value retention and stability.\n\nThis investment aims to transition to the 'Eigenlayer of Liquidity.' Post this transition, Turtle DAO anticipates no need for additional outside investment due to its already profitable nature.\n\nThe Minimum Viable Product (MVP) launched on March 11th and has achieved an Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR) of $27.5M, accumulating $4M-$5M in the treasury thus far. This indicates a robust and scalable business model.\n$TRT (Turtle DAO Token) Valuation stands at a $40M Fully Diluted Market Cap (FDV), with a comparable FDV of $30M. Given the asymptotic issuance curve, 70-80% of $TRT supply is unlikely to ever enter circulation, enhancing the value and scarcity of the token.\n\n**Key Points:**\n1. Investment Terms:\n - Smart Money Allocation: 2.5% $TRT allocation for $1M\n - The investment will support the transition to the 'Eigenlayer of Liquidity,' aiming to eliminate the need for further outside investment.\n - There are already over 1.65m in hard commits and another 400k roughly in soft commits\n2. Revenue and Treasury:\n - MVP launched on March 11th, achieving $25M ARR.\n - Accumulated $4M-$5M in the treasury, indicating strong financial health.\n3. $TRT Valuation:\n - $40M Fully Diluted Market Cap.\n - Comparable FDV of $30M.\n - 70-80% of $TRT supply is expected to remain out of circulation, increasing scarcity and value.\n4. Governance and Income:\n - Investment in $TRT allows participation in governance decisions.\n - Potential for passive income through platform fees and other revenue streams.\n\n**Presentation:**\nTurtle DAO is a decentralized autonomous organization focused on creating a robust liquidity infrastructure.

This adjustment is intended to stabilize the sprMAV 's value and promote sustainability within our ecosystem.\n\n**Summary:**\nIn response to the recent depegging of our sprMAV , we propose a reduction in emissions to address this issue. By decreasing the total emissions in liquidity and staking, we aim to restore confidence in the stability of our sprMAV 's value and ensure the long-term sustainability of our ecosystem. This proposal reflects our commitment to maintaining a stable and resilient platform for our community.\n\n**Context:**\nRecent events have highlighted the need to address the depegging of our sprMAV. To mitigate this issue, we propose the following measures:\n\nDecrease in Total Emissions\nWe propose to decrease the total emissions in liquidity from the current 2100 sprMAV per day to 1000 sprMAV per day. Additionally, the emissions in staking will be decreased from 1200 sprMAV per day to 800 sprMAV per day. This adjustment aims to reduce the supply of sprMAV s entering the market, thereby stabilizing the sprMAV 's value and promoting sustainability.\n\nRetaining Distribution Percentages\nDespite the decrease in emissions, we will maintain the distribution percentages between pools as determined by the current gauge voting. \n\n**Means:**\nNo development required for implementation.\nAdjustments will be made to emission parameters as specified.",

      "title": "SIP-9 | sprMAV re-pegging plan",
      "content": "TL;DR \nThis proposal aims to address the recent depegging of sprMAV from its 1:1 MAV peg by initiating a Treasury buyback up to $150,000 worth of sprMAV from the sprMAV-MAV liquidity pool. Additionally, we propose to add a buying wall at the 0.85-0.9 of the sprMAV peg to help maintaining the peg more effectively in the future. It is important to note that liquidity providers in the sprMAV-ETH pool may experience permanent loss due to this re-pegging. To compensate for this loss, extra incentives will be directed towards this pool.\n\n**Summary**\nFollowing the recent depegging of sprMAV from its 1:1 MAV peg, this proposal seeks to rectify the situation by implementing measures to re-establish and maintain the peg effectively. We recognize that the depegging has caused concern within the community, and we aim to address this issue promptly and fairly.\n\n**Context:**\nsprMAV has experienced a deviation from its intended 1:1 peg with MAV. To address this, the following steps are proposed:\n\n**1. sprMAV Buyback up to $150,000 worth of MAV** \nTo restore the 1:1 peg, the Treasury will initiate a buyback up to $150,000 MAV worth of sprMAV tokens from the sprMAV-MAV liquidity pool. \n\n**2. Add a Buying Wall at the 0.85-0.9 of the sprMAV peg**\nTo maintain the peg more effectively, we propose to do a buying wall for sprMAV to a range of 0.85-0.9 MAV per sprMAV. \n\n**3. Compensation for Impermanent Loss in sprMAV-ETH Pool**\nRecognizing that the buyback may result in permanent loss for liquidity providers in the sprMAV-ETH pool, we propose to offer additional incentives to compensate for this loss. These incentives will be allocated from the Treasury to ensure fairness and mitigate potential losses for our liquidity providers.\n\n*We believe that these measures will help restore and maintain the peg of sprMAV while providing a fair solution for liquidity providers affected by the re-pegging.*\n\n**Means**\n- Engineering resources: No development required.\n- Treasury resources:\n    - $150,000 worth of MAV will be used to buyback sprMAV\n    - Some USDC and ETH will be used as a wall-buyback at 0.85-0.9 sprMAV peg\n\n**Voting options:**\n- Approve the re-pegging plan\n- Against the re-pegging plan\n- Abstain",

      "title": "STP-7 | Change Team Allocation unlock parameters",
      "content": "**Summary:**\nThis proposal aims to change the Team allocation parameters from a single unlock date to a linear release over two years.\n\n**Rationale:**\nAccording to the original plan, the 20% Team allocation was scheduled to be unlocked 6 months after the ITO, specifically on the 5th of October 2023. However, releasing the entire allocation at once could have created substantial sell pressure, potentially destabilizing the market for our project. Acknowledging this risk, we have not yet distributed the team allocation.\nGiven these considerations, we are now proposing a modified approach: a linear unlock spread over two years. Importantly, of the total team allocation, only 50% will be distributed in this manner over the two-year period. The remaining 50% will be reserved for the future use of the DAO, particularly for new contributors who might join our team later on. \n\nThis approach ensures both immediate and long-term alignment with the project's goals and provides flexibility for future growth and collaboration.\nThis approach also demonstrates our commitment to the long-term success and health of the project, fostering greater confidence among investors and stakeholders.\n\n**Means:**\nThe team allocation will be distributed over a period of 24 months, starting from the end of the voting phase of this proposal (if accepted by the DAO). This means that a fixed percentage of the allocations will be released each day, ensuring a steady and predictable flow of allocations into the market.\nTo facilitate this new schedule, we will utilize a protocol known as LlamaPay for the execution of this plan. LlamaPay enables us to \"stream\" the allocation of funds according to the predetermined parameters. This approach involves setting up the protocol to distribute the team's allocations in a continuous stream, aligning with the agreed-upon progressive linear schedule. By leveraging LlamaPay's capabilities, we can ensure a seamless and automated distribution process, adhering closely to the newly established monthly intervals. This method not only simplifies the distribution but also upholds the highest standards of security and efficiency in the allocation process.\n\n**Technical Implementation:**\nCreate and configure the LlamaPay Streaming parameters\nMove the funds from the team allocation contract to the Treasury Multisig\nFund and Start the LlamaPay Streaming",

      "content": "**Summary**\nBuilding upon the success of previous initiatives (STP-4 and SIP-6), this proposal aims to extend the sprMAV incentive program for staking and liquidity provision. \n\n**Context**\nThe previous sprMAV incentive program (SIP-7), in addition to the new Referral program (SPP-1), successfully attracted approximately 400k MAV, giving a total of 1,2M MAV (27.2% of the total veMAV shares). \n\nRecent improvements in Maverick's trading and routing functionalities have prompted us to contemplate a potential change: replacing the sprMAV/USDC trading pair with the sprMAV/ETH pair. As part of this decision-making process, the DAO will need to assess whether to retain the sprMAV/USDC gauge within this program. Furthermore, if we do decide to keep both liquidities (USDC and ETH pair), it's important to consider that both of them will be smaller in size and potentially less efficient, as the available liquidity will be divided between two pairs, possibly affecting their performance.\n\nWith the significant delay in the Maverick Gauge system launch for the MAV token, we find it necessary to adapt our reward distribution strategy. As previously outlined in our Medium article, our original plan was to allocate 70% of the MAV tokens to our users through airdrops, with the remaining 30% distributed gradually after the drop. However, with the Maverick airdrop postponed, we face the challenge of providing a fair and sustainable incentive program.\n\nThis adjusted approach ensures that our community continues to receive valuable incentives and rewards while accommodating the unforeseen delay in the Maverick launch. We believe this strategy maintains fairness and transparency in our distribution process, aligning with our commitment to providing the best possible experience for our users.\n**Incentivization Allocation**\nConsidering the current estimations of Spiral Maverick airdrop share, we will distribute 18% of the remaining tokens, which will consequently reduce the amount available for future incentives.\n\n*92451.920366667 sprMAV are left to be distributed as follows:*\n- 40% will be allocated to sprMAV single staking.\n- 60% to be voted for by Staked sprMAV holders between those pools:\n - sprMAV/MAV: the gauge will last\n - sprMAV/USDC: Whether to keep or remove this pool's gauge.\n - sprMAV/ETH: Whether to introduce a gauge for this pool.\n\n**Means**\n- Engineering resources: The RewarderVault smart contract will continue distributing sprMAV tokens.\n- Treasury resources: Unless the airdrop amount is insufficient to cover the pre-minted sprMAV tokens, the Treasury will not bear any expenses.",

      "content": "**Summary:**\n\nThis proposal aims to establish a dedicated marketing multisig for Spiral DAO, managed by six DAO members, requiring three signatures for transactions (a 3/6 multisig). It also outlines the budget allocation for various marketing activities.\n\n**Context:** As Spiral DAO continues to grow, there is an increasing need for focused and efficient marketing efforts. A dedicated marketing multisig will streamline decision-making and fund allocation for marketing initiatives, ensuring agility and effectiveness in promotional activities.\n\n**Rationale:** The establishment of a 3/6 marketing multisig allows for secure and efficient management of marketing funds. By involving five core team members and requiring three signatures for transactions, the multisig ensures both security and flexibility in decision-making. This structure supports rapid and responsive marketing actions, vital for the DAO's growth and engagement.\n\n**Budget Allocation:** The proposed budget for the marketing multisig is set at $13,900, to be allocated quarterly for the following activities:\n\n- **DeBank Promotions:**\n    - To promote Spiral DAO on DeBank, create reward pools, and engage in related activities.\n        - Budget:\n- **One-Time Shill:**\n    - Payments for influencers who are engaged on a one-off basis, typically for single or rare promotional activities.\n        - Budget:\n- **Community Activities:**\n    - Funding for events and activities aimed at engaging and rewarding the Spiral DAO community.\n        - Budget:\n- **Ambassadors:**\n    - Regular payments to influencers who work with us on an ongoing basis. Currently, we are actively seeking a second ambassador under Curve, who will be onboarded soon.\n        - Budget:\n\n**Means**\n- Engineering resources:\n    - Create and setup a 3/6 multisig\n    - Transfers fund from DAO multisig to the Marketing multisig\n    - Regular payement according activites\n- Treasury resources:\n    - Quarterly 13,900 $USDC transfer from DAO multisig to the Marketing multisig",

      "content": "**Summary:**\n\nThis proposal aims to establish a dedicated marketing multisig for Spiral DAO, managed by six DAO members, requiring three signatures for transactions (a 3/6 multisig). It also outlines the budget allocation for various marketing activities.\n\n**Context:** As Spiral DAO continues to grow, there is an increasing need for focused and efficient marketing efforts. A dedicated marketing multisig will streamline decision-making and fund allocation for marketing initiatives, ensuring agility and effectiveness in promotional activities.\n\n**Rationale:** The establishment of a 3/6 marketing multisig allows for secure and efficient management of marketing funds. By involving five core team members and requiring three signatures for transactions, the multisig ensures both security and flexibility in decision-making. This structure supports rapid and responsive marketing actions, vital for the DAO's growth and engagement.\n\n**Budget Allocation:** The proposed budget for the marketing multisig is set at $13,900, to be allocated quarterly for the following activities:\n\n- **DeBank Promotions:**\n    - To promote Spiral DAO on DeBank, create reward pools, and engage in related activities.\n        - Budget:\n- **One-Time Shill:**\n    - Payments for influencers who are engaged on a one-off basis, typically for single or rare promotional activities.\n        - Budget:\n- **Community Activities:**\n    - Funding for events and activities aimed at engaging and rewarding the Spiral DAO community.\n        - Budget:\n- **Ambassadors:**\n    - Regular payments to influencers who work with us on an ongoing basis. Currently, we are actively seeking a second ambassador under Curve, who will be onboarded soon.\n        - Budget:\n\n**Means**\n- Engineering resources:\n    - Create and setup a 3/6 multisig\n    - Transfers fund from DAO multisig to the Marketing multisig\n    - Regular payement according activites\n- Treasury resources:\n    - Quarterly 13,900 $USDC transfer from DAO multisig to the Marketing multisig",

      "title": "SIP-6 | New incentivization system for sprMAV Staking and Liquidity",
      "content": "**Summary:**\nThis proposal aims to establish the plan for deployment of the initial sprMAV liquidity and the incentives allocated to bootstrap it.\n\n**Context:**\nFollowing the launch of Spiral’s first liquid locker for Maverick’s MAV governance token, the protocol successfully attracted around 500k MAV TVL and fast became 25% of the total veMAV share, allowing us to draw projections on the share of upcoming MAV airdrop captured by the protocol.\n\nThe previous proposal relative to sprMAV incentivization (STP-4) introduced the distribution of preminted sprMAV tokens to MAV depositors during the Maverick Incentive Program Season 1. The distribution was stated to occur in three stages, using a hybrid model of direct distribution and progressive incentives. \n\nIn order to further bootstrap MAV deposits into the liquid locker as well as liquidity depth in the several sprMAV wrapper pools deployed, an incentive program based on sprMAV emissions backed by treasury assets and future airdrop shares was defined with the parameters detailed below :\n\n**As reminder from the SIP-3:** \n- Allocating some of the Treasury assets to the pools on Maverick as a part of Spiral’s Treasury Management strategies.\n- Allocating a portion of our COIL/USDC POL to Maverick.\n- Allocating part of our Treasury composition for accumulating MAV aiming at 4% weight to start\n\n**Additional important parts that aren’t covered in SIP-3, but should be added:**\n- As after the CRV OTC deal we’ve increased our backing dramatically, we propose to initiate a small COIL buyback to get the current price in the range of 7-10% below the new backing.\n- To address the redemption being empty, we propose to implement a new redemption pool as a liquidity backstop for COIL/USDC on Maverick and to deploy it temporary in the range of -15% of the new backing current backing. This way we would be effectively farming the Maverick Season 1 for liquidity providers.\n\nThis proposal scope is one month. However, we might change it in a few weeks to better adjust the liquidity program to better share the liquidity or to introduce the voting emission power for sprMAV.\n\n**Maverick Pools parameters** \n*sprMAV/USDC*\nFee: 0.4%\nRange: 5%\n\n*sprMAV/MAV*\nFee: 0.04%\nRange: 0.10%\n\nTreasury will seed the liquidity in all the pools in a static mode for all three pools.\nThe structure of liquidity for the booster position LP on maverick should be the following:\n\n- sprMAV/USDC should have a Both modifier tight around the current liquidity with a total range of 10-30%\n- sprMAV/MAV liquidity should be incentivized in the range of 0.9-1.05 in a static mode with a deeper concentration of liquidity around 1\n\n**Incentivization allocation**\nAs mentioned in the SIP-3, the Treasury Multisig will mint sprMAV to incentivize the initial liquidity, the first plan was to distribute 2k sprMAV per day, but after more internal discussion, we believe that 3k sprMAV a day could boost liquidity even further.\n\n- **sprMAV/USDC :** 25% - 750 sprMAV daily\n- **sprMAV/MAV :** 35%  - 1050 sprMAV daily\n- **sprMAV single staking :** 40% - 1200 sprMAV daily\n\nTo sustain this incentivization, we will mint additional sprMAV on our Spiral Treasury to cover this 90k for the next month.\n\n**Means:**\n- Human resources: Multisig signers will have to do several Tx, no code is required.\n- Treasury resources: We’ll have to acquire MAV, and USDC will be used to seed the three Maverick pools. (COIL/USDC, sprMAV/USDC, sprMAV/MAV)\n\n**Technical implementation:**\nThe Treasury multi-sig  team will have to do several Tx :\n- Mint sprMAV\n- Buyback COIL to the desired levels\n- Create and seed the sprMAV/MAV liquidity on Maverick\n- Create and seed the sprMAV/USDC liquidity on Maverick\n- Launch sprMAV incentives on these pools + single staking pool\n- Create and seed the COIL/USDC liquidity on Maverick with the redemption addition\n\n**Voting options:**\n- Yes, start liquidity and incentive\n- No, rework the proposal\n- Abstain",

      "title": "SIP-5 | Deploy SDT Spiral Locker - a liquid locker for StakeDAO Protocol",
      "content": "**Summary:**\nThis proposal aims to start a discussion on the deployment of the second Spiral Locker — a liquid locker for our partner StakeDAO governance token — SDT.\n\n**Context:**\nSpiral Locker presents the first liquid locker solution for SDT token holders. By offering a transferable and tradable wrapped version of SDT — sprSDT, users will be able to maintain liquid while benefiting from capital efficiency. The platform enables sprSDT staking for boosting power and additional incentives, delegation to various addresses, or participating as liquidity providers in the sprSDT/SDT pool on Curve for CRV emissions. \n\n> **Boost Delegation**\nThe sprSDT holders in staking can manage their boosting power themselves by delegating boosts to their own address, or they can delegate their boosts to any other address. Additionally, sprSDT holders can delegate their boosts to Concentrator to receive Concentrator rewards in SPR every two weeks. Moreover, Paladin's SDT boost market will soon be integrated with Spiral's website, enabling sprSDT holders to participate in Paladin boost marketplace and lend their SDT boosts to renters on Paladin, earning native rewards.\n\nSDT delegation in Stake DAO works in such a way that boosts linearly lose their power over time. To maintain optimal boosting power, users have the option to redelegate their boosts periodically. By redelegating, they can ensure that their boosts retain their effectiveness over time. \n\n*However, redelegating is only necessary if the boosts have been updated on the receiver. If they haven’t – the receiver will still hold an effective balance from the date of the last update.*\n\n> **Initial Liquidity and Distribution:**\nCurrently, the Spiral Treasury holds 400k locked SDT and 300k SDT (~$300k worth). The first preminted sprSDT to kick-start liquidity and incentivize initial lockers will be backed by Treasury assets. \nWe will seek a gauge for this locker on Curve and possibly FraxSwap.\n\n**Minting fee**: as always – 0%.\n**Staking:** for the first few months, Spiral DAO won’t take any fees. Later on, the fee will increase to 10%.\n\n**Means:**\n- Human resources:\n    - The Multisig team will need to perform several transactions.\n    - Dev contributors will have to polish the smart contract base for liquid lockers.\n- Treasury resources: the Treasury will cover any costs for initial incentives if they arise.\n\n**Technical implementation:**\n- The Treasury Multisig will have to perform several txs:\n    - Seed the sprSDT/SDT pool on Curve\n    - Regularly perform actions regarding SDT token management, such as claiming and voting.\n- Building products on top of StakeDAO requires a new code base, which will have to be audited, as well as some changes on the Spiral front.\n\n**Voting options:**\n- Yes, let’s deploy SDT Spiral Locker\n- No, do not deploy SDT Spiral Locker\n- Abstain",

      "title": "STP-5 | CRV OTC deal",
      "content": "**Summary:**\nThe objective of this proposal is to determine whether or not we will make an OTC deal with Curve’s founder Michael Egorov.\n\n**Context:**\nRecently, Curve got hacked for over $70M through an exploit of the old Vyper version. Part of this hack involved the CRV/ETH pool draining most of the on-chain liquidity for CRV, significantly affecting the liquidity conditions, which could lead to liquidations on various Lending platforms. \n\nFor this reason, as well as to avoid any major liquidation on CRV, which could be systemically catastrophic, the Curve founder, Michael Egorov, opened OTC deals at a discounted price of $0.4/CRV (currently, the CRV price is around 0,57$ = ±30% discount price).\n\nSo far, a list of sales denominated in CRV has been executed with buyers such as:\n\n17.5M to Oxf510\n12.5M to DWF Labs\n5M to Justin Sun\n4.25M to DCF GOD\n3.75M to Machi Big Brothers\n2.5M to Cream Finance\n2.5M to erwwer [Oxbob]\n2.5M to Ox4d3\n2.5M to c2tp.eth [for 1M FRAX]\n1.24M to 0xcb5\n\nThis is an opportunity to invest $500k to $1M into this OTC deal. This will open up a lot of new valleys:\n\n- Buying strategic assets at a nice discount price (± 30%)\n- Enhance Spiral’s network effect amidst the Curve ecosystem’s high profiles and renowned actors.\n- Support the Curve ecosystem, including ourselves and our partner (StakeDAO)\n- Aid in building our new products around the Curve ecosystem\n\nRight now, we haven’t started any deals with Michael. The DAO has to vote so that in case there is an interest from Michael, we will immediately start the deal process.\n\nThe objective is to cover the existing debt against CRV at a discounted price / increase our position in stakeDAO liquid lockers and thus get more votes for COIL/FRAXBP liquidity. Currently, we have borrowed +800k CRV on the Aave lending market. With this opportunity, we will derisk our loan position while gaining more strategic assets at a lower cost.\n\n**OTC deal Conditions:**\n\nThe conditions are yet unknown, as we haven’t started a deal process yet. But we expect them to be the following:\n\n- 3-6 months lock-up period (but we can choose what do to with these CRV during this period: holding them in a wallet, locking them for veCRV, or even staking them in the StakeDAO Liquid Locker).\n- A minimum market price of 0.8$ (±37% pump) for CRV before being able to market sell.\n\n**Means:**\n- Human resources: Treasury Multisig members will need to do several transactions for the OTC deal and for the newly acquired CRV.\n- Treasury resources: $500k-$1M of USDC will be used to buy CRV at a discount price of 0,4$/CRV (±30% market discount).\n\n**Technical implementation:**\nTreasury Multisig members will need to do several transactions :\n- Free some USDC from the strategies / AAVE\n- Make the OTC deal",

      "title": "STP-4 | Approval for the first weeks of the Initial Incentive Program for sprMAV holders",
      "content": "Summary:\nThe previous proposal to deploy MAV Spiral Locker — a liquid locker for Maverick protocol has been accepted by the DAO: https://snapshot.org/#/spiralgov.eth/proposal/0x745f995e0f220e3a3f5c8ecc707c109670d1d7beb00456b549117b53ca1e3ff1\nThis proposal covered the Initial Distribution of preminted sprMAV to users who lock their MAV in Spiral lockers for the upcoming Maverick Incentive Program. \nThe current  proposal aims to discuss details of the Initial Incentive Program.\n\n\nContext:\nA new Spiral Locker for MAV tokens will be launched soon. Maverick won’t launch its tokenomics until a few months, so there will be no MAV emissions for some time. Before that, Maverick will distribute 10 mln MAV tokens to veMAV lockers during the Maverick Incentive Program Season 1 (Medium: https://medium.com/maverick-protocol/maverick-ecosystem-incentive-program-95cf76dbfa5e) Spiral DAO aims to capture a fair portion of this airdrop and distribute it to sprMAV holders as liquid-locked sprMAV. \nThe distribution is planned to be conducted in 3 stages following a hybrid model combining direct distribution and progressive incentives. Distributing incentives this way will strengthen sprMAV/MAV liquidity and the sprMAV peg. Spiral DAO will take a 10% fee for future incentives and other DAO needs. \n\nDuring the first month of the Initial Incentive Program, Spiral DAO will distribute preminted sprMAV. This sprMAV isn’t backed by anything yet and is a projection of the expected airdrop share. If the airdrop amount the DAO receives isn’t enough to cover the Initial sprMAV distribution — it will be covered by the DAO. However, this possibility is quite low. \n\nBefore sprMAV is whitelisted on Maverick:\nWe expect that to take ~ 1-2 weeks.\nDuring this time, we propose to distribute 2,000 sprMAV/day to sprMAV single-staking to encourage Spiral Locker adoption.\n\n❗ If we project that to 2-3 months of airdrop anticipation, the total sprMAV amount emitted this way would be 180k sprMAV, effectively evaluating our share as 1.8% of the total MAV airdrop. This is a really conservative estimation, and most likely, we can get a far bigger portion. This means that Treasury won’t need to step in and cover preminted sprMAV with its own votes.\n\nAfter this period, the DAO will vote again for a more structured incentivization plan with a target of creating deep liquidity for sprMAV.\n\n\nMeans:\nEngineering resources:\nRewarderVault smart contract will start distributing 2k sprMAV per day. The ownership over smart contracts will be transferred to the Treasury Multisig. After a couple of months, the ownership will be transferred to a more slow Protocol Multisig.\nTreasury resources:\nUnless the airdrop amount is not enough to cover the preminted sprMAV, the Treasury won’t bear any expenses.",

      "title": "SIP-4 | Deploy Spiral Locker - a liquid locker for Maverick protocol",
      "content": "**Summary:**\nFollowing the previous SIP, this proposal aims to start a discussion on the deployment of the first Spiral Locker — a liquid locker for Maverick protocol.\n\nUpon locking their MAV into Spiral Locker, users would receive sprMAV — a liquid version of veMAV. sprMAV holders would be able to stake their tokens and participate in Maverick's regular voting process while remaining liquid and receiving additional Spiral DAO incentives. Furthermore, sprMAV could be deposited into the SPR-boosted sprMAV/MAV liquidity pool on Maverick, enhancing the liquidity and utilization of sprMAV. Later on, other pools with sprMAV could be added as well.\n\n**Context:**\nTo enhance the integration of Maverick into the Spiral DAO ecosystem, we propose to launch the first Spiral Locker specifically designed for Maverick protocol. Spiral Lockers would be equipped with the following key features:\n\n- Deep Liquidity:\nTo ensure minimal price impact and impermanent loss. By incentivizing liquidity provision, Spiral DAO could foster a rational market and ensure seamless entry and exit for users.\n- Retaining Voting Power & Earning Vote Incentives:\nTo address the issue of users' alienation from their voting power in existing liquid lockers, Spiral DAO's liquid lockers would enable users to retain their voting ability and autonomous access to voting incentives.\n\n**Vote** **Incentives:**\n- **Reward currency:** sprMAV voters will receive vote incentives and fee sharing for their votes in the form of SPR from auto buybacks in exchange for bribes from external protocols.\n- **sprMAV Liquidity and Staking Incentives:**\nSpiral DAO will heavily incentivize sprMAV liquidity and staking by offering native sprMAV emissions as rewards. This will encourage the formation of robust sprMAV liquidity and active participation in staking.\n- **Minting Fees and Initial Fees:**\nsprMAV will have 0% minting fees and 0% initial fees, ensuring a fair and accessible token distribution. Over a period of three months, the fees will gradually increase to 17% to support ongoing initiatives and DAO needs.\n- **Biweekly Votings:**\nSpiral DAO will conduct regular biweekly voting to engage the community and ensure inclusive decision-making processes. Those who prefer to manage their voting strategies themselves will be able to do so. There will also be an option to delegate voting power to Spiral and receive voting incentives or elsewhere.\n\nWe believe that deploying Spiral Lockers and promoting the adoption of sprMAV will bring significant value and benefits to the ecosystem. We are confident in our ability to deliver deep liquidity, empower users with voting rights, and foster a thriving community of sprMAV stakeholders.\n\n*Spiral DAO will also utilize Spiral Locker for locking MAV from the Treasury to support sprMAV liquidity and engage in liquid voting strategie*s.\n\n**Means:**\n- Human resources:\n    - The Multisig team will need to perform several transactions.\n    - Dev contributors will have to polish the smart contract base for liquid lockers.\n- Treasury resources: the Treasury will cover any costs for initial incentives if they arise.\n\n**Technical implementation:**\n- The Treasury Multisig will have to perform several txs:\n    - Seed the sprMAV/MAV pool on Maverick\n    - Regularly perform actions regarding MAV token management such as claiming and voting.\n- Building products on top of Maverick requires a new code base, which will have to be audited as well as some changes on the Spiral front.\n\n**Voting options:**\n- Yes, let’s deploy MAV Spiral Locker\n- No, do not deploy MAV Spiral Locker\n- Abstain",

      "content": "**Voting options:**\n- (Option 1) Expand on Maverick, add MAV to the Treasury Composition aiming at 4%, and start strategic acquisition of MAV tokens from the open market.\n- (Option 2) Expand on Maverick, add MAV to the Treasury Composition aiming at 4%.\n- (Option 3) Expand on Maverick, don't add MAV to the Treasury Composition.\n- (Option 4) Do not expand on Maverick.\n- Abstain.\n\n**Summary:**\nThe goal of this proposal is to expand Spiral to the Maverick Ecosystem.\n\n**Context:**\nIn a nutshell, Maverick Protocol is an innovative & incentivized automated market-making protocol. \n\nSince launching its Dynamic Distribution AMM, Maverick has supported over 2.5B trading volume, with the highest 374% protocol capital efficiency ratio (Volume/TVL). Within 4 months of launch, Maverick has become a major AMM provider in the LST market. It supported the highest trading volume in the LST market yesterday, with over 30% of the LST trading volume on chain.\n\nMaverick protocol also shares Spiral’s core vision — optimizing the market efficiency and making it available for everyone.  This is why positioning ourselves in the early stages of Maverick will be a really great move for Spiral.\n\n**The suggested expansion includes:**\n1. **Allocating some of the Treasury assets to the pools on Maverick as a part of Spiral’s Treasury Management strategies.** This will allow Spiral DAO to increase its share of the MAV token and significantly increase Treasury APR. \n2. **Allocating a portion of our COIL/USDC POL to Maverick.** This will significantly increase our liquidity and will increase the overall utilization of funds. This will also contribute to increasing the yield for our Treasury and accumulating MAV. This step will also increase our POL efficiency and might be useful for redemption mechanisms in the future.\n3. **Allocating part of our Treasury composition for accumulating MAV aiming at 4% weight to start.** veMAV wars are promising to be really big in the next couple of months at least. It looks like in the coming years it’s going to be really close to Curve by the scale, and Spiral DAO definitely should join as Spiral DAO mechanics are closely tied to the vote/incentives market. The earlier we start, the faster we will be able to get a significant share of the veMAV market and become a big player in the coming veMAV wars.\n4. **Building products around Maverick ecosystem and integrating them into the Spiral ecosystem.** There is already some development going on in this area. More on this later. Spiral will be able to get a portion of MAV airdrop from liquidity providing as well as a portion of veMAV for locking part of MAV tokens and possibly an incentive for building on top of Maverick.\n\nMaverick is also going to heavily incentivize protocols after its full launch which will also benefit our strategy both in terms of yield and possible veMAV share accumulation. Maverick Ecosystem Incentive Season 1 (Medium: https://medium.com/maverick-protocol/maverick-ecosystem-incentive-program-95cf76dbfa5e). \n\nExpanding and integrating with Maverick is also a great opportunity for Spiral to increase its influence and role in the ecosystem as well as attract a lot of attention and TVL. Spiral/Maverick integration seems like a logical step for the DAO which benefits both our and Maverick’s ecosystem efficiency and will bring a lot of value for Spiral Community.  \n\n**Means:**\n- 4% of the Treasury allocated to collecting veMAV\n- Treasury Multisig will have to do multiple transactions for allocating part of our POL as well as other Treasury assets to Maverick.\n- Dev contributors will have to work on the smart-contract base for products built around Maverick ecosystem and integrate them into our DAO.\n\n**Technical implementation:**\n- The Treasury Multisig will have to perform several txs:\n    - Allocate POL to Maverick\n    - Choose strategies and allocate Treasury assets to Maverick for yield generation and MAV accumulation.\n    - Regularly perform actions regarding MAV token management such as claiming and voting.\n- Building products on top of Maverick requires a new code base, which will have to be audited as well as some changes on the Spiral front.",

      "content": "**Summary:**\nThe purpose of this proposal is to swap part of our 80/20BAL-WETH+auraBAL LP for vlAURA with the aim of increasing the overall treasury APR.\n\n**Context:**\nCurrently, the DAO treasury has $780,86k worth of [80/20BAL-WETH+auraBAL LP on Aura](https://app.aura.finance/#/pool/1) with an average APR of 25% (paid in 19% $AURA and 6% $BAL). \n\nBy swapping part of this LP for $AURA, which we will then lock, it will be possible to obtain an APR of around 40-50% (paid in $USDC) instead of 25% with the current LP, which will increase the overall APR of the treasury. To do this, locked AURA (vlAURA) has to be delegated to Paladin's auto-voter, which offers the best current yield on the market, as you can see in the picture below.\n\nThat’s why the Spiral Contributor team is proposing to swap $200k worth of 80/20BAL-WETH+auraBAL LP for $AURA \n\n*Please note that, unlike LPs, vlAURAs are not liquid, i.e. they are locked for a period of exactly 16 weeks and 2 days before they can be \"unlocked\" or relocked.*\n\n*Just as a reminder, it’s possible to consult the DAO treasury through 3 links:*\ndApp dashboard: https://spiral.farm/dashboard\nDebank: https://debank.com/profile/0xc47ec74a753acb09e4679979afc428cde0209639\nDune Dashboard: https://dune.com/beg1/spiral-dao\n\n**Means:**\n- Human resources: the Multisig team will need to do several transactions explained above in the Technical implementation.\n- Treasury resources: there is no direct cost to the Treasury other than potential slippage and price impact by withdrawing LP and swapping them for $AURA.\n\n**Technical implementation:**\nThe Multisig team will need to :\n1. withdraw $200k worth of 80/20BAL-WETH+auraBAL LP\n2. swap 80/20BAL-WETH-auraBAL LP for $AURA.\n3. lock $AURA for vlAURA\n4. delegate vlAURA to “Paladin-voter.eth”\n5.

However, if these members become inactive or leave the server, their OG roles may no longer be necessary.\n\nBy removing OG roles from inactive members, the server can maintain an active and engaged community by incentivizing participation and rewarding members who are actively contributing. Redistributing the roles to more active users also creates a sense of fairness and encourages members to stay engaged with the server.\n\nAdditionally, having a cleaner and livelier community can attract new members and improve the overall quality of interactions and discussions within the server. It can also make moderation and management of the server easier by reducing the number of inactive or unused roles that need to be managed.",

      "content": "**Summary:**\n\nThe objective of this proposal is to determine whether or not we will allocate our treasury funds to invest in the Curvance seed round.\nhttps://docsend.com/view/miiiffqvjhr9jrsd\n\n**Context:**\n\nThe seed tokens will be locked according to the voting escrow mechanism of the project’s governance token, veCVE and will be fully unlocked after a 12-month cliff period. This means that for the first 12 months, the seed tokens will remain unavailable and cannot be transferred or sold. Once this period is over, seed investors will have full access to their tokens and can use them as they see fit, it means that (in the case we’re investing) we’ll be able to participate in governance decisions and have the ability to vote on gauge emissions and generate passive revenues for the Treasury, on top of fees sharing.\n\nGauge emissions in Curvance are a mechanism that allows approved pools to receive continuous streams of CVE rewards. The Curvance DAO votes biweekly to determine the allocation of emission rewards and which pools receive them. This incentivizes liquidity provision and helps attract new TVL to the platform.\n\nIn addition, veCVE holders will receive income from the platform fees charged on the generated yields of deposited assets. The platform fee is set at 15% and will be redistributed to veCVE holders proportionally based on the amount of veCVE they hold relative to the total veCVE in circulation, in the form of wETH.\n\nNotable investors in the fundraising round include other prominent decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) such as Frax, Olympus, Redacted, Alchemist, Harvest (treasury Bond type deal), as well as angel investors like the founder of Curve and other industry experts.\nThe participation of these DAOs and well-respected individuals highlights the confidence and support in Curvance's vision and potential for growth in the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem.\n\nPlease note that the specific investors mentioned are subject to change and may vary based on the latest information and developments in the fundraising process.\n\n***Presentation***\nCurvance is a decentralized lending and borrowing platform built on the Ethereum blockchain. It offers risk-isolated lending markets by utilizing a multi-pool model that allows stablecoin depositors to choose their preferred risk tolerance. The platform enables users to deposit their assets, earn yield through smart contract redirection, and borrow stablecoins against their collateral. With Curvance, users can unlock a portion of their locked capital, boost their yields, and explore new opportunities for capital efficiency and leverage. The protocol employs a dual oracle design for price determination and relies on a community of liquidators for asset liquidations. Curvance aims to provide users with enhanced flexibility, earning potential, and risk management in the DeFi ecosystem.\n\n* Docs: https://docs.curvance.com/cve/ \n* Pitch-deck: https://docsend.com/view/miiiffqvjhr9jrsd \n* Website: https://www.curvance.com/ \n* Twitter: https://twitter.com/Curvance\n\n**Means:**\nTreasury ressources: We would need to invest X amount of USDC into it and wait for 2 years\n\n**Technical implementation:**\nFuture CVE token allocation will be associated with a Treasury multisig.\n\n**Voting options:**\n* Invest $50k \n* Invest $75k \n* Invest $100k \n* Invest $150k\n* Invest $200k\n* Against\n* Abstain\n\nFurther information about risks, advice and Proposed investment options are on Discord.",

      "content": "Summary: \nRemove OG roles from all inactive members of the discord server.\n\nRationale: \nI propose to remove OG roles from inactive members.  However, if these members become inactive or leave the server, their OG roles may no longer be necessary.\n\nBy removing OG roles from inactive members, the server can maintain an active and engaged community by incentivizing participation and rewarding members who are actively contributing. Redistributing the roles to more active users also creates a sense of fairness and encourages members to stay engaged with the server.\n\nAdditionally, having a cleaner and livelier community can attract new members and improve the overall quality of interactions and discussions within the server. It can also make moderation and management of the server easier by reducing the number of inactive or unused roles that need to be managed.\n",

      "title": "SIP-0 | Decrease COIL single-staking APR",
      "content": "**Summary:**\nWe propose to decrease COIL single-staking APR to 90 or 100%. \n\n**Context:**\nOur Spiral DAO community have had sustained concerns about the topic we are about to discuss. Recently some members of the Curve community have reached out to us about it as well. These are concerns about the sustainability of the high single-staking APR and the OHM-like model overall for the DAO and the whole ecosystem. The problem lays in the huge APR that makes any LP in our pool inefficient for external actors.\nWe think they're onto something, and we have mentioned in the previous proposal about increasing APR that this state of things is not forever. So we're proposing some tweaks to help things stay balanced.\n\n**Rationale:**\nThe first step we want to propose is to cut down the COIL staking APR from a massive 271.828% to a more balanced 100% or even 90%.\nThis change will apply to all users who are currently staking  COIL and those who will stake in the future.\nBringing down the APR means less speedy inflation for COIL and more solid support for every COIL in the future. It also helps to spread out the value more evenly among all of our Spiral DAO users, whether they're staking or not. This change will also slow down the growth of POL, which most importantly will result in a decrease in POL share and make our bribes a lot less efficient. So we're planning some more adjustments down the line. \n\n**Voting options:**\n* Decrease COIL single-staking APR to 100%.\n* Decrease COIL single-staking  APR to 90%.\n* Keep the APR as it is.\n* Abstain\n\n**Future:**\nIf this proposal is accepted, we believe the next step should be decreasing the APR of single staking even further in the following two months to a value between 1x-3x the Treasury APR. \nBesides that, the whole model of a huge POL won’t be that efficient with this decrease in the APR. It may lead to some massive changes in our Tokenomics and possibly the change of the SPR model overall. Instead of the old value-preservation focus, we may need to start distributing some of the yields to the DAO members.",

In addition in the voting options, I will add a lower amount (100k SPR) that can also be a fair point at this early stage.\n\n*After calculating the average and median of the community votes, we obtain:*\nAn **average of 238k SPR** and a **median of 227k**, based on this I chose that 200k SPR might be the best starting point for the coming months.\n\nEach vote has to reach the minimum quorum, even if it has a majority, for it to be considered an official proposal. It is the responsibility of the proposal author to enlist voting participation from the community to reach a quorum.\n\nNote that these modifications are possible to change again in the future depending on the data of the next votes.\n\n**Means:**\n* Human resources: If the proposal is approved, this will need to adjust the Quorum Parameters on the Spiral's Snapshot.\n* Treasury resources: There is no treasury cost.\n\n**Technical implementation:**\nNo technical implementation required",

      "title": "Bug Bounty Vault Proposal by Hats Finance",
      "content": "Summary\nThis is a proposal for Spiral DAO to collaborate with Hats.finance to create an on-chain, free, non-custodial, scalable and permissionless incentives pool for hackers/auditors to protect the Spiral DAO smart contracts. The goal of the vault is to incentivize responsible vulnerability disclosure for Spiral DAO. Liquidity can be added (with $SPR and/or yield-bearing tokens) permissionless and LPs will be rewarded with $HAT tokens once the liquidity mining program is launched.\n\nBackground & Motivation\nHats.finance is a on-chain decentralized bug bounty platform specifically designed to prevent crypto-hack incidents by offering the right incentives. Additionally, Hats.finance allows anyone to add liquidity to a smart bug bounty. Hackers can disclose vulnerabilities responsibly without KYC & be rewarded with scalable prizes & NFTs for their work.\n\nSmart bug bounty programs are a win-win for everyone. They can be created easily with a few on-chain transactions (it takes less than 1 hour to set up a vault on Hats), and are free of charge. Hats will only charge a fee once an incident has been successfully mitigated. \n\nOn-chain submission: \nWith the values of Ethereum, which are lighting our way, we decided to take a different approach to bug bounty compared to the traditional and centralized bug bounty platforms.\n\nThe submitter writes a detailed vulnerability description on Hats dApp. The submission is encrypted with the project PGP key. The user hashes the encrypted description (Automatically)  and sends a transaction on-chain with that Hash (only the Hash of the encrypted report is going on-chain), While sending the encrypted message to the routing bot.\n\nThe key advantage of Hats solution compared to traditional, centralized bug bounty services:\nBug bounty vaults are loaded with the native or yield bearing token of each project. Reducing the free floating supply while giving the token additional utility.\n\nScalable bounty network — vault TVL increases with success / token appreciation of the project.\n\nOpen & Permissionless — Anyone can participate in the protection of an asset they are a stakeholder of and any hacker, anywhere in the world, can participate anonymously when disclosing exploits (no KYC needed)\n\nIn the future when providing liquidity(taking risk) every depositor could earn $HAT tokens.\n\nContinuous — As long as tokens are locked in the vault, hackers are incentivized to disclose vulnerabilities through Hats, instead of exploiting the project.\n\nAdditional advantages of deployment of the existing Spiral DAO bug bounty program on Hats Protocol:\nSpiral DAO can reach out to many more security researchers (aka white hat hackers) with a bounty on Hats protocol and each scrutiny will make Spiral DAO safer.\nSpiral DAO can fund the bug bounty vault on Hats with its own native token ($SPR or yield bearing token)\nThe bounty reward for the submitter is not paid at once to reduce the price pressure on the project token.\nSince Spiral DAO will be farming $HAT tokens with its bounty, it's a cost negative opportunity for Spiral DAO.\n\nSpecification\nIn case that the proposal gets accepted, Spiral DAO is expected to:\n1- Choose and set up a committee\n2- Send 30k $SPR tokens to the committee multisig, which will manage the funds at the bug bounty vault and initiate a payout in case of successful vulnerability reports\n\nOnboarding action items:\nChoosing a committee: The committee is preferably the public multisig contract of Spiral DAO or a multisig specifically set up to manage the bounty program.\nThe Committees responsibility:\nTriage incoming vulnerability reports/claims from auditors/hackers (get back to the reporter within 12 hours).\nApprove claims within a reasonable time frame (Max. of 6 days)\nSet up repositories and contracts under review. (A list of all contracts covered by the bounty program separated by severity)",

      "title": "Future Treasury Composition Discussion",
      "content": "Author: VaeVictis\n\nSummary:\nAs we are getting closer to the Gauges, it's important to discuss future token weights. We have 2 major questions to decide on as of right now:\n\n1)We must discuss and establish a future target Treasury composition, enabling us to rebalance our Treasury through bribes markets, OTC deals, or other methods while setting goals for the foreseeable future.\n\n2)We need to decide the future of byproducts/extra rewards. As projects sometimes incentivize additional liquidity with other reward tokens, it's important to discuss what we should do with them on a DAO base. The primary example of that may be GEAR tokens, which we already have a bit in our treasury.\n\nRationale:\n1\nThe current Treasury composition is the following.\n61.8% USDC\n14.3% CRV\n11.7% BAL\n5.2% FXS\n3.8% SDT\n3% ETH [Due to 80% BAL 20% ETH proportion]\n\nI propose to try to reach the following ratio in the nearest couple of months:\n45% Stables/USDC\n20% CRV/CVX\n15% BAL/AURA\n6% FXS\n4% SDT\n10% Other (ETH + BTC + Partnership assets)\n\nThis would potentially lead to:\n-Getting a bigger exposure towards CRV/BAL through bribes\n-Some external partnerships / Treasury swaps\n\n2\nRegarding other tokens, we propose adopting a default practice of \"not-selling and utilizing\" until the Treasury's portion is less than 1% of the total. We can then reevaluate and determine the token's necessity in our portfolio. The reasoning behind this lies in our values and that we try not to cannibalize the protocols, in case there is an ability to get a good yield on them.",

      "content": "**Summary:**\nI propose to create a governance framework for the Spiral governance, in order to have an easy-to-read and qualitative discussions on the next governance proposals.\n\n**Rationale:**\nThis post aims to define a framework for the Spiral governance, by defining several types of proposals depending on the subject discussed, voting on DAO rules, and creating templates that should be helpful for everyone trying to participate.\n\nPosting a proposal on Discord in the Governance section and discussing it there allows to get a sentiment check and some valuable feedback about the community ideas and upcoming snapshot votes. Every vote should be on Discord and archived once voted on Snapshot.\n\n**I) Required information for any proposal:**\n\n__**Discord governance post:**__\nEach proposal should be posted on Discord in the Governance section for at least 24 hours before posting on Snapshot, which allows the community to give some feedback, and propose changes. If the time period is not respected, the proposal will be automatically refused and deleted.\n\n**Discussion duration** : at least 24 hours\n**Snapshot duration** : 24 hours\n**Quorum** : no Quorum for now\n\n*Why only 24 hours ? Being agile and really fast in decision-making is crucial for long term success.*\n\n__**Proposal type, number and name:**__\nEach proposal must be easily identifiable and correctly classified.\n- Type: SIR - SGP - SIP - SPP - STP.  *This will be detailed in the second part of the proposal.*\n- Name: The name must be the same on Discord and on Snapshot (Max 10 words).\n- Number: Each proposal must have a number that represents the post order on the Discord and on Snapshot.\n**Summary:** Short description of the proposal (1-2 sentences max)\n**Rationale:** Detailed explanation of the proposal and milestones for its execution.\n**Means:** Resources needed for this proposal\n- Human resources: Special skills required (dev or others)\n- Treasury ressources: Proposal cost (in COIL/SPR and in $), % of the treasury required, etc.\n**Technical implementation: **Highlight the technical implementations of this proposal if any.\n**Voting options:** Mention the options that will be included on the snapshot vote, including an “Abstain” one.\n\n**II) Proposals types and formats:**\nWith different sections, we could define different types of proposals, depending on the subject discussed and the importance for the protocol.\n\n__***Spiral Integration Request (SIR):***__\nProposal to add an LP/Vault/etc to the bond farming.\n\n**Project Presentation:** (After summary)\n- Protocol name\n- LP/vault/etc. requested\n- Smart contract address\n- Audit(s) links\n- Chain requested\n- Relation with the project\n- Twitter/Discord/Telegram links\n\n**Metrics:** (After project presentation)\nRisk assessment:\n- Smart Contract risk: maturity, transactions, audit, bug bounty, etc.\n- Counterparty risk: holders, smart contract permission, multisig, etc.\n- Market Risk: market cap, yield, etc.\nCommunity size on Twitter/Discord/Telegram (for trusts).\n\n__***Spiral Governance Proposal (SGP):***__\nSGPs are about common governance proposals, especially the ones related to the DAO organization  to the governance process\nThis type of proposal should include, in addition to all the points mentioned in the first part:\n\n**Context:** (After summary)\nThe SGPs would concern but wouldn’t be limited to:\n- Modification of the governance framework\n- Add/Remove a signer on the treasury multisig\n- Etc.\n\n__***Spiral Improvement Protocol (SIP):***__\nSIPs are about the most important modifications on the protocol.\nThis type of proposal should include, in addition to all the points mentioned in the first part:\n\n**Context:** What’s the modification and why it’s needed.\nSIPs would concern but wouldn’t be limited to:\n- New version of the protocol\n- Modification of a smart contract\n- Updates on the initial parameters \n- etc.\n\n__***Spiral Partnership Proposal (SPP):***__\nSPPs are about how we should work with potential Partnership.\nThis type of proposal should include, in addition to all the points mentioned in the first part:\n\n**Context:** What’s the plus-value of this Partnership and what should we do ?\n- Grant program if any\n- Contributors/DAO committees rewards\n- Long term partnerships (i.e Dao Swaps)\n- etc.\n\n__***Spiral Treasury Proposal (STP):***__\nSTPs are about how should we manage the treasury.\nThis type of proposal should include, in addition to all the points mentioned in the first part:\n\n**Context:** What’s the plan? with all calculations required.\n- Treasury allocation strategy & budgets\n- Liquidity mining votes\n- etc.\n",

      "content": "**Summary:**\nLet's talk about something important — inflation. In the current state of the market our COIL single-staking APR is not enough. The initial 100% APR were a temporary solution of small-inflation and was basically a joke compared to all other OHM-like DAOs. We need to stop this disgrace and get to serious levels of inflation.\n\n**Rationale:**\nWe propose to increase the COIL single-staking APR from the current rate of 100% to 271.828% for the time being.\nThis increase will apply to all users who are currently staking COIL and those who will stake in the future\nThe APR is subject to change on the future by decision of the community.\n\nThe increased APR will help incentivize new users to join our DAO and it's also just a good way to have more COILs for everyone. It's a must-do for us to sustain a high level of POL too. Higher APR will help us remain competitive in the market, which will benefit the DAO in the long run.",

      "title": "postpone airdrop (phase 1) for 2-3 weeks",
      "content": "Background\n\nSpiral DAO plans to airdrop 3–5% of the initial token supply to existing Balancer, CRV, FXS, and SDT stakeholders as well as other DeFi users. Only users holding an amount greater than the specified threshold below are eligible for the Airdrop.\n\nAirdrop will be allocated to:\n\n42% — CRV/CVX users: vlCVX, veCRV, Convex LP\n25% — BAL/AURA users: veBAL, vlAURA, Aura LP\n7% — FXS stakeholders: veFXS\n3% — SDT stakeholders: veSDT\n7.6% — LobsterDAO NFT owners\n7.6% — Degenscore Beacon NFT owners\n8.6% — Top-1000 DeBank profiles\n\nFirst come first serve\n\nUsers will receive an equal amount of tokens (100 SPR). However, the supply for each category is limited, which is why only the first X users to claim their Airdrop will be eligible. The X for each category is roughly the following:\n\n270 — CRV/CVX stakeholders: 80 — veCRV; 90— vlCVX; 100 — Convex LP\n160 — BAL/AURA stakeholders: 45 — veBAL; 50 — vlAURA; 65 — Aura LP\n45 — FXS stakeholders\n20 — SDT stakeholders\n50 — LobsterDAO NFT owners\n50 — Degenscore Beacon NFT owners\n55 — Top-1000 DeBank profiles\n\n\nProposal\n\nWe suggest postponing the Phase 1 airdrop for 2-3 weeks. This would allow us to spread out the distribution of tokens over a longer period, potentially reducing sell pressure. Additionally, with more time to prepare, we can create a more effective and engaging marketing campaign to reach a broader audience. This could result in increased participation in the airdrop and a stronger community around the token.\n\n\nExecution\n\nIf the proposal to postpone the airdrop for 2 weeks is accepted, we will take the following steps to execute the delay:\n\nSet a new date for the airdrop that is 2 weeks after the original date.\nCommunicate the delay to our community and stakeholders through our official channels, including our website, social media accounts, and community forums.\nAdjust the timeline of our marketing campaign and notification plan to better prepare for the airdrop and reach a wider audience.\nMonitor the impact of the delay on our community and stakeholders, including engagement with our marketing campaign, user feedback, and participation levels in the airdrop.\nExecute the airdrop according to the updated plan on the new date, ensuring that all eligible users receive their tokens in a timely and efficient manner.\n\n\nSuccess\n\nWe believe that postponing the airdrop for 2-3 weeks could lead to a more successful and effective distribution of tokens, which could benefit both Spiral DAO and its users in the long term. We are committed to executing the delay plan in a timely and efficient manner and to maintaining clear and transparent communication with our community and stakeholders throughout the process.",
