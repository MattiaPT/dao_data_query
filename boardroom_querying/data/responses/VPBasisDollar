Hence the rebrand is proposed to \n- BLUE DOLLAR\n- BLUE SHARES\n(if there's more peg token in the future, it shall be BLUE [PEG-TOKEN])\n\nand token symbology will follow as :\n- blUSD\n- blSHARE\n(if there's more in the future, it will follow the standard of bl[TOKEN-SYMBOL])\n\nWe would like Signiorage Stakers and LPs to vote for the rebranding and approving the budget of 9k BSD + 9k USDC for the rebrand package that consists of:\n\n•  Design of new Logo\n•  Rebrand launching video\n•  Front end design to be in sync with the new logo\n•  A set of 40 static memes\n•  A set of 10 animated memes\n•  A follow up video that reacts to the community’s response\n\nBLUE Moodboard and the rebrand is designed by @a b 9 5:\nhttps://www.figma.com/file/bfjdwMy9ksoZ1wtrAJ8SkA/BLUE-Moodboard?node-id=0%3A1",

      "content": "This proposal can be found at https://forum.basisdollar.fi/t/bdip21-use-dao-resources-for-implementation-of-curve-stableswap-pool/\n\nBackground: Most DEXs operating on a liquidity pool (including Uniswap, ValueLiquid) operate as a constant function market maker. Curve (aka StableSwap) operates as a constant sum market maker. https://www.curve.fi/stableswap-paper.pdf\n\nFor a basket of assets operating at close to equilibrium (e.g. a basket of stablecoins):\n(a) When the token prices are closed to equilibrium (1 to 1), it’s performing close to a constant sum curve.\n(b) When the token prices are shifted away from the equilibrium, it’s performing close to a constant product curve.\n(c) The further the token prices are shifted away, the more slippage the invariant produces. This ensures that the pool can always provide liquidity even at extreme prices.\n\nRecently, Curve has permitted stableswap pool creation for pools that consists of traditional stables (USDT, USDC, DAI) and algostables.\n\nThe benefits of implementing an algostable+USDT+USDC+DAI stableswap pool on Curve are:\n(1) Expands the audience for Basis Dollar; and\n(2) Generates interest in Basis Dollar from arbitrageurs who can close the gap between the ValueLiquid and stableswap pool.\n\nHence, other projects have also started looking at implementing stableswap pools. https://medium.com/basis-cash/stableswap-pools-and-algorithmic-stablecoins-b21ab5cb555f\n\nMechanism (How will this work?):\n(1) Create the stableswap pool.  The initial peg would be 1 BSD to 1 USDC to 1 DAI to 1 USDT.\n(2) For the initial USDT in the pool, the DAO would swap some of the DAI and USDC into USDT.  For example, the initial pool would consist of 40k BSD, 40k USDC, 40k USDT, 40k DAI.\n(3) The Curve LP token will be stakeable. That Curve LP token can be staked with vesting rewards in the form of BSDS rewards.***\n\n***All BSDS rewards are currently locked into ValueLiquid contracts, therefore, there may need to be a requirement to migrate to a new BSDS token contract.  Alternatively, the rewards that the DAO receives can be distributed to the Curve LP stakers.   For the 1st phase, just implement Step (1) and (2) first.\n\nAdvantages:\n1. Expands audience/users for Basis Dollar with the new stableswap pool.\n2. Generates interest in BSD especially from arbitrageurs.\n3. The fees from transactions on the Curve stableswap pool will accrue to LP token holders. Furthermore, the LP token holders may also receive staking rewards mentioned above.\n\nDisadvantages:\n1. May require new BSDS token contract as existing BSDS emissions are locked into the ValueLiquid contracts.\n",

Reduces selling pressure of BSD and BSDS on the market.\n2. The vesting period means people will stay engaged longer (so as to claim rewards).\n\nDisadvantages:\n1. Reduces APY which may mean less interested farmers (but then again, you will have avoided the speculative farmers).\n\n",

      "content": "This is similar to the current proposal under consideration by https://mith.cash/\n\nThe idea behind this proposal is to create a disincentive for sellers of BSD on BSD trades below $1.  By corollary, this creates an incentive to:\n1. Buy BSD when BSD trades below $1.\n2. Buy or sell BSD when price is at $1 (and above).\n\nThis could be a variable tax rate:\n5% of transaction value on BSD sellers on all BSD trades below $1\n10% of transaction value on BSD sellers on all BSD trades below $0.90\n15% of transaction value on BSD sellers on all BSD trades below $0.80\n20% of transaction value on BSD sellers on all BSD trades below $0.70\n25% of transaction value on BSD sellers on all BSD trades below $0.60\n30% of transaction value on BSD sellers on all BSD trades below $0.50\n35% of transaction value on BSD sellers on all BSD trades below $0.40\n40% of transaction value on BSD sellers on all BSD trades below $0.30\n45% of transaction value on BSD sellers on all BSD trades below $0.20\n50% of transaction value on BSD sellers on all BSD trades below $0.10\n\nWhat happens to the tax?\nThe tax is only imposed on sellers of BSD (when BSD is below $1).  The tax proceeds will go to the DAO to be used for incentives e.g. to reward BSDS holders.\n\nImplementation challenge: This will likely require a change in the token code such that the tax happens based on the exchange function.  It could be that the tax always happens and a rebate is returned if the oracle price shows that BSD >= $1.\n\nAdvantages:\n1. Clear disincentive / penalty on BSD sellers when BSD is below $1.\n2. Increased demand for bonds, as BSD holders (when BSD is below $1) is faced with 2 alternatives: (a) Sell and be taxed, or (b) swap into bonds (no tax).\n\nDisadvantages:\n1. Likely requires new token contract.",

      "content": "Chungus on Telegram contributed significantly to this proposal design.\n\nBackground:\nAt present, BSD/stable pools continue to emit BSDS, even while BSD < $1.  This emission creates downwards pressure on BSD, while not helping incentivize movement of BSD to $1.\n\nProposal:\nAlign interest of BSD/stable farmers with the overall ecosystem's objective of pegging BSD at $1.  To do this, we propose:\n(1) Pause all emissions of BSDS rewards to BSD/stable pools while BSD < $1.\n(2) These paused emissions continue to accrue, that is, they will be paid out at a future date when BSD > $1. \n\nFor example, we can take block-by-block snapshots of addresses owning LP tokens in the BSD/stable pools.  This will allow distribution of accrued BSDS at a later date (similar to the model adopted by Balancer).\n\nAdvantages:\n1. Reduce downward pressure on BSDS.\n2. No loss of BSDS by BSD/stable farmers.  They are just accruing for later distribution.\n3. Aligns BSD/stable farmers with the ecosystem: Everyone gets rewarded when BSD > $1.\n4. Potentially, some BSD/stable farmers may cease LPing due to deferred rewards emissions, which means that there may be less resistance (or costs) in moving BSD towards $1.\n\nDisadvantages:\n1. BSD/stable farmers' rewards are temporarily locked up.  However, this is no different than the vesting in Sushiswap, Luaswap, and other projects.\n",

      "title": "BDIP12 (Formal vote): Reduce threshold for seignorage and bond redemption",
      "content": "Objective of this proposal:\nReduce threshold for seignorage and bond redemption from $1.05 (at present) to $1.01.\n\nBackground to this proposal:\nBasis Cash is implementing a lower threshold (albeit dynamically) because of the following issues:\n1. At $1.05, there is a range between $1.0 and 1.049 when BAC investors (staked in boardroom) do not receive seignorage incentives.\n2.  This also affects bond redemptions as bond holders need to have confidence that it reaches 1.05 before they can redeem their bonds for BAC.\n\nBy lowering the threshold, the protocols targets a more narrow peg closer to $1, which is the project’s ultimate value proposition.\n\nReferences to the contract code:\nWith reference to the contract code at https://etherscan.io/address/0xebb54967c52a39c21cbd3a91a4e6c3e175d88630#code\n\nLines:\n982 dollarPriceOne = 10**18;\n983 dollarPriceCeiling = dollarPriceOne.mul(105).div(100);\n\n1135 function redeemBonds(uint256 amount, uint256 targetPrice) external onlyOneBlock checkCondition checkOperator {\n1136 require(amount > 0, “Treasury: cannot redeem bonds with zero amount”);\n1140 require(\n1141 dollarPrice > dollarPriceCeiling,\n\n1170 function allocateSeigniorage() external onlyOneBlock checkCondition checkEpoch checkOperator {\n1178 if (dollarPrice > dollarPriceCeiling) {\n1179 // Expansion ($BSD Price > 1$): there is some seigniorage to be allocated\n\nBased on existing parameters set out in line 983, the threshold is set at $1.05 for both bond redemption and seignorage expansion.\n\nMechanism (how it works):\n\nPropose to amend threshold to $1.01 for both bond redemption and seignorage expansion.\n\nAdvantages:\n1. Positive impact for bond holders: Lower threshold for bond holders to redeem bonds. Less trapped cash. Otherwise have to wait till >1.05.\n2. Positive impact for BSDS holders: Lower threshold to start receiving BSD rewards. Otherwise have to wait till >1.05.\n\nDisadvantages:\n1. While “lowering the threshold is a must for any trustworthy algo-based stablecoin” (in BAC dev’s words), the risk of lowering the threshold has been discussed elsewhere i.e. seignorage and bond redemptions trigger expansion of BSD circulating supply and the usual risks of BSD being sold into DAI and USDC. The long-run use case of BSD e.g. as a yield farming asset, is important to develop also.",

      "content": "This is a formal proposal.\n\nAs per https://docs.basisdollar.fi/ProtocolParameters, this requires (among other things) a voting quorum of 20% and a minimum epoch length of 6 epochs (3 days).\n\nFollowing the successful passing of the indicative vote on the following proposal below, this is now being put forward as a formal proposal. https://gov.basisdollar.fi/#/basisdollar.eth/proposal/QmdgYtadcFe1iEf3yHSviDkmEhWJXB9fTaXzoNq5HXU4oD\n\nNote: We remain in a contraction phase, so the effects of this proposal won't happen until we are next in an expansion phase.\n\nTo recap the proposal:\nAs per https://docs.basisdollar.fi/ProtocolParameters, during expansion periods, inflation is capped at 4.5% or 9.0% (depending on whether there is system debt outstanding).\n\nThe rate of BSD printing may result in rapid deceleration of BSD price past $1, until it is below $1.\n\n2.5% compounded every 12 hours, doubles the amount of BSD in existence in 28 epochs (14 days).\n\nHow it works (Mechanism):\n\nAmend the following as such:\n\nWDP above 1$ where amount of $BSD in Treasury contract >= total Supply of $BSDB (Basis Dollar Bond)\nMaximum Supply Expansion: 1.25%\nExpansion Percentage: WDPrice - 1 * 100 or 1.25% (whichever is lower)\n\nWDP above 1$ where amount of $BSD in Treasury contract < total Supply of $BSDB (Basis Dollar Bond)\nMaximum Supply Expansion: 2.5%\nExpansion Percentage: WDPrice - 1 * 100 or 2.5% (whichever is lower)\n\nAdvantages:\n\n1. For those in the BSD/DAI and BSD/USDC farms, this reduces the extent of impermanent loss you face as there will be less BSD printed and therefore potentially less sold into the farms.\n\n2. Reduces inflation during an epoch where BSD > $1.\n\nDisadvantages:\n\n1. The APY on Seignorage Shares will decline as BSD inflation will be reduced. However, this may lead to normalized, sustainable long-term APY, rather than short-term capital that moves in and out.\n\n2. Due to the reduction in BSD emission when BSD > $1, there will also be less BSD available for bonds to be redeemed (ensuring that all bondholders will tend to be come long-term bondholders rather than short-term bondholders). It will take more time to clear system debt. However, this will also mean that we will be less likely to fall below the $1 peg and therefore have smaller amounts of system debt.",

The system has hit its max debt ratio of 35%.\n\nThere is currently a pre-proposal which increases the bond supply ratio.\nhttps://gov.basisdollar.fi/#/basisdollar.eth/proposal/QmS6rQyRYvHhjWQp6Da7CaAAATVMgWpFyTm5wBU84hvymt\n\nHowever, increasing the bond supply means we are introducing more volatility into the system.  The flood of BSD from bond redemptions will result in a high likelihood of us going below $1 again.\n\nThere is an alternative: All bonds presently have no expiry.  We introduce an expiry date on all bonds.  If there is interest in this approach, we can then vote on an expiry period.\n\nWhat is the effect of this?  The advantages are:\n1. Expiring bonds free the system up for the supply of new bonds, under the existing debt ratio.\n2. Because the debt cap remains, we reduce the extent of a potential flooding of BSD because there are less redeemable bonds (compared to if we increased the debt ratio).\n3. Existing bondholders will be incentivized to purchase BSD up to $1 so that their bonds are redeemable for BSD.\n4. Existing market participants will have an incentive to front run the rise in BSD prices.\n\nWhat are the disadvantages? \n1. Potential bondholders in a future contraction cycle will hold off on purchases of bonds as they will factor in the expiry risk.\n2. Current bondholders in this contraction cycle will be forced to take immediate action to push the price of BSD up to $1.

      "content": "It has been 3 weeks since launch and Basis Dollar has made a great progress. Our special thanks to the help and support of our awesome community. \n\nHowever, we fully aware that we need to step up on the marketing to push Basis Dollar to the next level. With that in mind, we have been keep on searching for right candidate to join our core team as the Marketing Director. And we glad to propose @conston for the position.\n\nProposed Compensation: \nBase Salary: US$ 4K/month, paid in BSD on the 1st of the month.\nVested Compensation: US$ 2K/month of BSDS at market price and staked in the Seigniorage for 1 year.\nTotal compensation: $72K/year.\nOverall cost to the DAO fund: $6K per month.\n\nFollowing is the quick self intro from @conston\n\nHello community members, most of you know a little bit about me based on the comments that I posted in the group.  I would like to give you a little more insight into my background.  I have a BBA from the University of Michigan's School of Business with a concentration in Finance and Marketing.  I started out my career as a cost analyst and quickly moved up to a Senior Financial Analyst.  Many of my thoughts came from spending thousands of hours developing budget forecasts or analyzing financial reports.  After my financial career, I moved into sales and marketing for large companies like United Technologies and Saturn Electronics where I reached the level of Director. I have run my own consulting business for over 20 years, I have been a part of 8 startups, and 7 cryptocurrency projects, 3 were successful and 4 were not.  It is the lessons that I take from those failures to ensure that those same mistakes are not repeated with other projects.  I also was an 'expert' rater on ICO Bench, I analyzed and rated over 190 crypto projects there.  Doing that gave me a feel for which projects would succeed and which would not.   I am joining this project because I believe this is one of the projects that can succeed and prosper.\n\nI give 100% in everything that I do, and I promise to give 100% to this project and my goal will be to ensure that it succeeds beyond our wildest expectations.\n\n\nYou can find out more about me on these social links below.\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/constontaylor/\nhttps://twitter.com/taylormade2k\nhttps://icobench.com/u/conston-taylor",

      "title": "BDIP10: Slow down bond redemption (& strengthen DAO further) when BSD > $1.",
      "content": "There is the risk of BSD reflooding market quickly during expansion phase, due to redemption of Bonds.\n\nAs per https://docs.basisdollar.fi/ProtocolParameters, when:\n(1) There is expansion and NO system debt exists, then 100% of expansion is distributed to seignorage stakers.\n(2) There is expansion and system debt exists, then 35% of expansion is distributed to seignorage stakers and 65% of expansion is made available for redemption of bonds.\n\nThe existing 35% of expansion distributed to seignorage stakers also means that BSDS holders take some seignorage that would otherwise go to bondholders for redemption.  This BSD printing received by seignorage stakers can also flood the market.\n\nI propose the following concept:  When there is an expansion and system debt exists, then:\n(1) Assign 20% of the expansion for redemption of bonds.\n(2) Assign 80% of the expansion is transferred to the DAO fund.  \n(3) Thus, 0% of expansion is distributed to seignorage stakers.\n\nOnce no more system debt exists (and there is expansion as BSD > $1), then assign 100% of expansion to seignorage stakers.\n\nHow it works (Mechanism):\n\nAmend the following to:\nWDP above 1$ where amount of $BSD in Treasury contract < total Supply of $BSDB (Basis Dollar Bond)\nExpansion Distribution:\nSeigniorage Stakers: 0%\nRedeemable: 20%\nDAO: 80%\n\nAdvantages:\n(1) Reduces the extent of bond redemptions for BSD and then having those BSD re-circulated into market.  This is the effect of shifting from 65% to 20%.\n(2) Strengthens the DAO.  This helps build up DAO assets, thus strengthening the DAO as a stabilizer.  The additional seignorage accumulating into the DAO means that the DAO also has more BSD to exchange into Bonds during contraction periods.\n(3) Removal of the 35% of seignorage that goes to seignorage stakers (even while system debt exists during an expansion period) reduces the impact of more BSD flooding the market.  If it is held in the DAO, it strengthens the DAO (and can be sold in an orderly manner).\n\nDisadvantages:\n(1) There will be a gas war as bondholders will be incentivized to spend more gas to redeem bonds on first-come, first-serve basis.  On the other hand, there was already going to be a gas war as only 65% of expansion (under existing system) is made available for redemption.  \n(2) There may be a disincentive to purchase bonds by investors (especially short-term investors) as there is a slower rate of bond redemption.  Bondholders will tend to be long-term investors.",

During contraction, use DAO assets to buy up BSD to speed up return to $1.\n2. During expansion, use DAO assets to sell BSD and BSDS to accumulate more resources for contraction.\n\nHow it works (Mechanism):\n\n1. No check during an epoch change.\n\n2. Check if spot price of BSD < $0.95 once per hour (except during epoch change).\nIf yes, use up to 2% of DAI and USDC to buy up BSD from the LPs, subject to max. purchase price is $0.95 post-slippage, no more than 1% slippage.\nThe $0.05 gap is to leave it to the market to close the remaining to $1.\n\n3. Check if seignorage emitted during last epoch AND if spot price of BSD > $1.05 once per hour (except during epoch change).\nIf yes, sell up to 2% of BSD held by the DAO for DAI and USDC (evenly, 1.0%+1.0%), subject to min. sale price is $1.05 post-slippage, no more than 1% slippage.\nThe $0.05 gap is to leave it to the market to close the remaining to $1.\n\nSell BSDS when BSD > $1.05, every hour, no more than 1% slippage.\n\nAdvantages:\n1. During expansion, builds up a pool of assets in the form of USDC and DAI in the DAO.   Maximizes the value of DAO resources as it converts BSD (which is intended to be long-term stable at $1) into USDC and DAI at prices of more than $1.  The DAO therefore collateralizes the system.\n2. During contraction, the USDC and DAI in the DAO is used to support BSD price.  \n3. Complements the bond system.  The bond system provides bonds to soak up excess BSD from the market.  The DAO's purchases of BSD during contraction helps remove excess BSD from the market.\n4. Sale of BSDS during expansion ensures community has ownership.  DAO doesn’t own system – Community does.\n\nDisadvantage:\n1. DAO competes with market participants.\n2. There is a risk that BSD remains permanently (just) under $1 in the event of a contraction cycle, if people feel that expansion will result in new flood of BSD.  Hence, limiting bond redemptions is also key.",

      "title": "BDIP09: Cap BSD inflation at 2.5% per epoch when BSD > $1",
      "content": "As per https://docs.basisdollar.fi/ProtocolParameters, during expansion periods, inflation is capped at 4.5% or 9.0% (depending on whether there is system debt outstanding).\n\nThe rate of BSD printing may result in rapid deceleration of BSD price past $1, until it is below $1.\n\n2.5% compounded every 12 hours, doubles the amount of BSD in existence in 28 epochs (14 days).\n\nHow it works (Mechanism):\n\nAmend the following as such:\n\nWDP above 1$ where amount of $BSD in Treasury contract >= total Supply of $BSDB (Basis Dollar Bond)\nMaximum Supply Expansion: 1.25%\nExpansion Percentage: WDPrice - 1 * 100 or 1.25% (whichever is lower)\n\nWDP above 1$ where amount of $BSD in Treasury contract < total Supply of $BSDB (Basis Dollar Bond)\nMaximum Supply Expansion: 2.5%\nExpansion Percentage: WDPrice - 1 * 100 or 2.5% (whichever is lower)\n\nAdvantages:\n1. For those in the BSD/DAI and BSD/USDC farms, this reduces the extent of impermanent loss you face as there will be less BSD printed and therefore potentially less sold into the farms.\n2. Reduces inflation during an epoch where BSD > $1.\n\nDisadvantages:\n1. The APY on Seignorage Shares will decline as BSD inflation will be reduced.  However, this may lead to normalized, sustainable long-term APY, rather than short-term capital that moves in and out.\n2. Due to the reduction in BSD emission when BSD > $1, there will also be less BSD available for bonds to be redeemed (ensuring that all bondholders will tend to be come long-term bondholders rather than short-term bondholders).  It will take more time to clear system debt.  However, this will also mean that we will be less likely to fall below the $1 peg and therefore have smaller amounts of system debt.",

(Mechanism of implementation)\n\nStep 1: Use all the USDC and DAI in the DAO to purchase BSD up to the price of $1 (post-slippage) from the market, subject to the following conditions:\n(i) Purchases using USDC and DAI are made every 30 minutes.\n(ii) Maximum of 1% slippage on each pair.\n\nStep 2: Where there is availability of bonds to purchase, exchange all BSD in the DAO to bonds.\n\nAll BSD not exchanged for bonds is retained in the DAO.\n\nAdvantages of this proposal:\n(1) No user funds are being used to take us to $1. Only DAO resources being used.\n(2) There is $1m worth of BSD in the pools.  $138k in buying pressure from the DAO represents 13.8% of all BSD.\n\nDisadvantages of this proposal: \n(1) Markets naturally/should front-run DAO purchases.  However, this is ok, as it means both the market and DAO working hand-in-hand to take us back to $1.\n(2) DAO resources are limited and will be used for this exercise.",

      "content": "The initial parameters of the BasisDollar project are chosen following the successful model of another project. And we believe it will have a long-term effect on the project.\n\nNote that all these parameters could be changed later with the community's votes as we don't implement them as fixed parameters.\nUnder the initial rule, if BSD price > 1$ when epoch changes, and if there are no Bonds exists (supply($BSDB)=0), Treasury contract will mint 4.5% more BSD of the total supply (at first seigniorage, it's 500k $BSD). If Bond exists and greater than BSD in Treasury (the protocol is in debt phase), Treasury contract will mint 9% more BSD of the total supply.\n\nThere are concerns from the community for not enough incentive when expansion happens. We might revisit the initial rule-following another successful project. Instead of checking BSD price, we could enforce first X epochs as an expansion with 4.5% or 9% maximum.\n\nWe ask the community to vote FOR,  and all qualified voters are LPs at BSDS pools (BSDS-DAI and BSDS-USDC pools).\n\n1. No change at all\n2. 6 first epochs with 4.5% max expansion\n3. 6 first epochs with 9% max expansion\n4. 14 first epochs with 4.5% max expansion\n5. 14 first epochs with 9% max expansion\n\nNote: Option 2 and 3 could be extended to 14 epochs (7 days) or more according to the community's proposal.\nReference: ESD has this bootstrap period for 90 epochs (30 days), DSD has it for 152 epochs (12.6 days).\n\nExample to explain the proposal:\nVote for 1:\nWhen seigniorage happens, if BSD price is lower than 1$, the expansion will not be happening, BDIP-01 doesn't benefit LPs. \n\nVote for 2:\nWhatever the price is, the protocol will keep expanding the BSD total supply by 4.5% for each epoch until 14 first epochs are over (22500 $BSD for first epoch). The expanded $BSD will be given to stakers and LPs according to BDIP-01.\n\nVote for 3: Same as option 2, but with 9% expansion.",
