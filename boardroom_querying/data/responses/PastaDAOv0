      "title": "Long Term Liquidity Incentives",
      "content": "Proposed by [@monet-supply]().\n\n### Background\n\nPASTA liquidity has improved considerably since the last [liquidity incentive program](https://snapshot.org/#/pasta.eth/proposal/QmWcGfdRQF8bWAboDuqf1S3jtwjNKyWXCgfUntyEMgrwPY) was conducted, with nearly 2 million PASTA now held in the [Uniswap v2 pool](https://v2.info.uniswap.org/pair/0xe92346d9369fe03b735ed9bdeb6bdc2591b8227e). However, this still represents less than 15% of the total token supply. \n\nOne potential issue is that regular Uniswap LP fees may not be enough to offset impermanent loss from occasional large changes in the PASTA/ETH price ratio. Adding predictable, long term incentives should help counterbalance this effect and support greater participation.\n\n### Proposal\n\nI propose initiating a new liquidity incentive program, distributing 300,000 PASTA tokens to the Uniswap v2 PASTA/ETH LP over 3 months. Funds would be distributed directly to the Uniswap Pool via a [Pasta Chef](https://github.com/Pasta-DAO/pasta-chef) contract like the first distribution.\n\nThe [PastaDAO multisig](https://gnosis-safe.io/app/#/safes/0xB449dfE00aACf406eb442B22745A25430490FE1b/balances) currently holds 1,219,000 PASTA, of which 190,000 have been committed to previously approved expenses but not yet issued (90,000 for development grants, 100,000 to be transferred to the [DAO timelock](https://etherscan.io/address/0x9bb5a48878baa8bd884ecf6bdbc3812ca2bf9b9f)). So this proposed 300,000 expense would represent roughly 30% of the multisig's remaining funding over the next 3 months. During this time, additional fees from PASTA transfers or sales should partly offset this expenditure.\n\n### Next Steps\n\nIf this proposal is approved by voters, the multisig will fund a liquidity incentive distribution mechanism with 300,000 PASTA from the treasury for a 3 month distribution period. Notice will be given to the community in [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/XAZMWBTrMH) in advance of when the rewards period begins.\n\n### Proposal Question\n\nDo you approve transferring 300,000 PASTA from the DAO multisig for this 3 month liquidity incentive program?",

      "content": "Proposed by [@monet-supply](https://twitter.com/MonetSupply).\n\n### Background\n\nIn a previous [snapshot vote](https://snapshot.org/#/spaghetti/proposal/QmbExpq8p6xez2K4Md51v8nuVoQaYcMSGhEL6zCVYXhoEm), the community signaled support in principle for contributing funds for public goods grants. [Gitcoin](https://gitcoin.co/blog/gitcoin-grants-round-9-governance-brief/) is one of Ethereum’s preeminent public goods funding mechanisms, and would be a good candidate for PastaDAO’s initial contribution campaign. \n\nVitalik Buterin also mentioned the value of ongoing grants funding in his recent [post](https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/04/02/round9.html) on Gitcoin Grants Round 9. PASTA’s ingrained transfer fee mechanism could serve as a foundation for sustainable ecosystem contributions, while retaining enough funds for community development initiatives and protocol reserves.\n\n### Proposal\n\nI propose a two part donation to Gitcoin Grants matching fund.\n\n- One time initial contribution of 150,000 PASTA to Gitcoin Grants Round 10, with the intention of PastaDAO joining as a sponsor (roughly 10% of PastaDAO's initial foodbank funding)\n- Ongoing donation of 10% of tokens earned by the protocol foodbank through the PASTA transfer fee, until such time as governance passes a further proposal to discontinue the donation\n\nNote that Gitcoin accepts funds in either DAI or ETH, so PASTA amounts shown above will be exchanged for one of these assets at the multisig signers’ discretion before funds are sent to Gitcoin. \n\nThe ongoing donation will be targeted towards matching funding for future Gitcoin rounds, with accumulated assets transferred to Gitcoin on a quarterly basis.\n\n### Next Steps\n\nIf this measure is approved by voters, the PastaDAO multisig will be authorized to convert 150,000 PASTA to DAI or ETH and transfer this amount to Gitcoin for use as matching funds in grants round 10.\n\nFurthermore, the multisig will earmark 10% of future inflows from PASTA transfer fees for Gitcoin grants matching, with funds converted to DAI or ETH at the multisig signers’ discretion and transferred on a quarterly basis. This will continue until a governance proposal discontinues the ongoing donation.\n\n### Proposal Question\n\nDo you support donating an initial 150,000 PASTA to Gitcoin Grants Round 10 matching fund, with ongoing donations of 10% of transfer fee revenues to future Gitcoin matching rounds?\n",

These will be invaluable to the DAO moving forward, and it seems fitting that these contributions are properly recognized and rewarded.\n\nPastaDAO also benefits from the previous open source development work of other protocols including Compound (governor alpha and comp token frameworks) and Uniswap (infrastructure for PASTA/ETH liquidity). Granting funds back to these organizations sets a positive example for open source development and could help build goodwill between communities.\n\n### Proposal\n\nI propose granting 120,000 PASTA from the [DAO multisig](https://gnosis-safe.io/app/#/safes/0xB449dfE00aACf406eb442B22745A25430490FE1b/balances) to the following grantees for their contribution to the PastaDAO codebase:\n\n- [@mubaris](https://twitter.com/realmubaris): 60,000 PASTA for development of the Pasta Chef and governance contracts\nAddress: mubaris.eth\nTerms: 30,000 PASTA will be released immediately upon vote approval, with the remaining 30,000 PASTA released after 3 months\n\n- [Compound governance](https://compound.finance/): 45,000 PASTA for development of COMP token and governor alpha contracts\nAddress: 0x6d903f6003cca6255D85CcA4D3B5E5146dC33925 (Compound governance timelock)\nTerms: 45,000 PASTA will be released after the price of PASTA reaches $1.\n\n- [Uniswap governance](https://uniswap.org/): 15,000 PASTA for development of Uniswap v2\nAddress: uniswap.eth (Uniswap governance timelock)\nTerms: 15,000 PASTA will be released after the price of PASTA reaches $1.\n\n### Next Steps\n\nIf this proposal is approved by voters, the multisig will be authorized to transfer 120,000 PASTA to the grantees listed above according to the specified terms.\n\nI also plan to work with the DAO on additional funding proposals for any other community development needs. Everyone is welcome to join us in [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/XAZMWBTrMH) to discuss this and future proposals.\n\n### Proposal Question\n\nDo you approve granting 120,000 PASTA from the DAO multisig to the parties listed above?",

This allows a wider group of potential users to participate in governance.\n\nThe space can also be upgraded/updated via the controller of the pasta.eth domain (currently monetsupply for convenience but this can be transitioned to DAO ownership in the future).

      "content": "Proposed by [@monet-supply](https://twitter.com/MonetSupply)\n\n### Background\n\nPASTA liquidity is relatively thin, with only 300-400,000 PASTA available in the [Uniswap pool](https://info.uniswap.org/pair/0xe92346d9369fe03b735ed9bdeb6bdc2591b8227e) over the past week. This limits the ability of old holders to exit their position, and for potential new members to join the DAO.\n\nDeeper liquidity could benefit PASTA by improving price discovery and allowing free entry and exit from the DAO, and may also increase the amount of tokens accrued to the [treasury](https://gnosis-safe.io/app/#/safes/0xB449dfE00aACf406eb442B22745A25430490FE1b/balances) if trading volume increases as a result. \n\nAdditionally, more liquidity will increase the value and impact of any DAO approved PASTA token donations, such as the public goods funding contemplated [here](https://snapshot.org/#/spaghetti/proposal/QmbExpq8p6xez2K4Md51v8nuVoQaYcMSGhEL6zCVYXhoEm).\n\n### Proposal\n\nAuthorize the PastaDAO multisig to use 100,000 PASTA tokens for liquidity incentives to be distributed over an initial 7 day period. \n\nIncentives will be drip fed directly to the Uniswap PASTA/ETH liquidity pool, so users can gain rewards simply by depositing their funds to Uniswap without needing to stake their LP tokens in an additional contract.\n\n### Next Steps\n\nIf this proposal is approved by voters, the multisig will deploy the liquidity incentive distribution mechanism and fund it with 100,000 PASTA from the treasury for a 1 week distribution period. Notice will be given to the community in [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/XAZMWBTrMH) at least 24 hours before the rewards period begins.\n\nWork on the distributor contract is ongoing, so the exact date liquidity incentives can begin remains TBD.\n\nDepending on the impact and benefits of this incentives program, the community could choose to extend or modify incentives through additional proposals in the future.",
