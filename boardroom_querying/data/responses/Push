Project TLDR (2-3 Sentences)\n\nInverter is an ‘Operations Portal’ for organizations to manage their grants programs, funding operations, and treasuries. It is a one-stop-shop for contributors to apply for funds, manage funds and maintain feedback loops with funders and community stakeholders. It is a milestones-based funding mechanism that enables due diligence primitives such as KYC verifications, entity establishment, automated invoicing, and on-chain equity activation to open pathways to loan financing.\n\n5. Proposal Category\n\nTooling\n6. Project Overview\n\nInverter dApp is inspired by the Operations Portals that are being used to fund over 1.2 trillion USD for development projects across the globe by organizations like United Nations, World Bank, and European Union. Our aim is to interconnect the novel technologies of web3 to the grounded funding infrastructures of traditional organizations to improve access to funding and inspire distributed ownership for builders and funders of the next generation of the internet regardless of their backgrounds.\n\nSimply said Inverter is an ‘Operations Portal’ for organizations to manage their grants programs, funding operations, and treasuries. It is a one-stop-shop for contributors to apply for funds, manage funds and maintain feedback loops with funders and community stakeholders.\n\nInverter Product MAIN Features TL DR\n\n(2022)Initial Release:\nMilestone-based Long term project/workstream funding and joint funding with reduced overhead\nTransparency around funded projects for communities\nOrganizations can manage and track their incoming proposals and funded proposals from one\norganizational page\nTeams can have one common proposal that can be used for applying to, streaming funding from,\nmaintaining accountability with, and receiving continuous feedback from many organizations.\nAbility to withdraw funding from a project\n(2023) Funder Treasury accounts that can run yield earning and diversification strategies with continuous payment abilities\n(2023) On-chain milestone-based investment based on KPIs and Due Diligence\n(2023) Multi-token funding with fluid funding governance\n(2023) Tax-deductible donations\n(2023) On-chain organization(DAO, Association, etc.) establishment\n(2023) Community Conviction Signaling\nInverter Development Timeline\nCurrently in Development Phase to carry out a Private Beta Launch by the end of November.\n\nBelow is a detailed project roadmap;\n\nPhase I:\nMVP Development (ongoing- Q1 2023)\n\nComplete\n\nDefining core feature set for the Private Beta Launch\n* Finalize MVP scope\n* Shape core feature sets such as user journeys, lofi mockups\n* prepare high-level solution designs for frontend\nHiFi UI designs\nOn-Going\n\nSmart Contract development\nLanding Page development\nProposal creation wizard implementation\nData management structure development for:\n* User activities\n* Project Proposal\n* Notification Services\nUser & Funder Organization Profile page implementation Regression tests (not started)\nNot Started\n\nRegression tests\nBugfix and Improvements\nTest Coverage\nKPIs for the Q4\n\nRegister 10 Organizations (DAOs and Grant Program) to the Private Beta Launch\nOnce an organization is registered on Inverter it will have its own profile page where the users can access information related to the organization. Once we register PUSH to Inverter contributors, once they press the ‘Subscribe’ button and enable notifications, will start receiving notifications related to the organization. The notifications will include but not be limited to:\n-New Grant Program Announcement\n-New Funding Announcement\n-New Proposal\n-Forum Posts\n-Updates and News on Funded Projects\n\nHave 10 Projects created on the Inverter dApp\nUsers will be able to subscribe(follow in this case) to projects that is being funded on Inverter the same way they can subscribe to an organization and receive notifications. Once the users follow a project they will be receiving notifications about the updates regarding the project.\n\nPush Protocol Proposal KPIs\n\nHave +100 users subscribe on dApp and receive Push notifications.\n\n \n![image](ipfs://QmeTbVt2SLUM6afEqPECCnSqSkV7Noh7MgwkhWLzMmm9rb)\n    \n\nOften Asked Questions & Answers\n\n- Do you have DAOs & contributors using your platform already?\nCurrently, we have 15 soft committed organizations to become funders during our beta launch. We have +10 soft committed projects to create a proposal on the Inverter dApp. We are hoping to register the Push protocol to Inverter as a funder and establish a long-standing partnership.\n\n- What’s your strategy to get DAOs onboarded?\nOur main strategy is to invite DAOs, research organizations, and grants programs, to the Inverter to test the product, go through the Inverter experience and then establish close feedback relationships with these organizations so that the roadmap of the project can address more of their pain points, needs, and desires as we continue iterating towards new features, services, and integrations. Our initial target organizations include but are not limited to DAOs such as PushDAO and AaveDAO, Climate Collective (focused on Climate projects), TE Academy, and Ecosystem Funders, which are L1s and protocols with large communities that are also incentivizing people to build on top of their infrastructures.\n\nAs such, we have already built feedback loops with our initial set of partners that have collaborated with us to address an organic demand for funding infrastructure. This includes organizations such as BlockScience, PrimeDAO, TEC, TE Academy, Climate Collective, Celo Network, and Aave. Finally, we aim to roll out two testing phases where we will invite our partners to fund some of their workstreams and grants through Inverter before we go with a broader public launch.\n\n7. Value Proposition to Push\n\nIncreased adoption of Push\n\n-We believe that it is really important for Push to integrate as many web3 projects and tools as possible. When we integrate Push to Inverter for the notification services we want to provide to funders and contributor teams, many organizations and working teams will have experienced the Push services and their benefits. We will build our internal app notification system based on Push services and encourage Push adoption for our users. With Push, users will have access to crucial information to coordinate the funding process of a project. Below is a list of some of the notifications users will receive:\n\nList of notifications\nProposal Owner\n\n“You got funded!”, element click → route to the proposal detail page\n\n“A funder withdraw its fund”, element click → route to Proposal dashboard’s “Proposal Pool” page\n\n“A Funder dropped a feedback”, element click → route to proposal detail page & scroll to the feedback area\n\n“Your milestone duration has ended, please add your proof of completion document”, element click → route to proposal details & scroll milestone section\n\nYou reached the minimum funding amount you can start streaming funds → route to trigger the funding button on the proposal overview page.\n\nProposal Funder\n\n“Your milestone x duration ended, please upload your report”, element click-> route to proposal details milestone section\n\n“A new funder join your funded proposal”, element click → route to proposal dashboard\n\nNew feedback provided to your funded proposal, element click → route to proposal feedback space\n\nYour funded proposal has a new proof of completion report, element click → route to proposal details milestone section\n\nPush Grants\n\n-After registering the Push Grants program to the Inverter, Push will have the opportunity to manage its grants program on the Inverter with the benefits provided such as increased transparency and accountability, milestone-based funding, and collaborative funding.\n\n8.

      "title": "PGIP-1: Push Grants Program v2.0 ",
      "content": "# Push Grants Program v2.0\n\nLink to proposal in forum:\nhttps://gov.push.org/t/pgip-1-push-grants-program-v2-0/957\n\n\nAuthors:\n\n-   Jaf\n-   Co-authored with  Miss Walter\n\n## Intro:\n\nEarlier this year we started our  [Push Grants Program](https://medium.com/push-protocol/push-grants-program-its-here-f2bfba29388f)  (PGP) with the goal of funding contributors to BUIDL their projects and help with the adoption and expansion of the Push Protocol ecosystem.\n\nThis first iteration of the Push Grants Program (”PGP v1.0”) was funded with a budget of $1,000,000 USD (883,955 $PUSH at the moment of the funding) equivalent of $PUSH tokens from the community treasury. Since then, the program has funded 4 grantees including Push content producers, a Bounties marketplace, a Social Hiring platform, and even a Pixel 2D multiplayer online game. And as a result of Push Protocol presence in Hackathons and events this year we have been observing an increased interest of our community and hackers in pursuing PGPs.\n\nThese past two quarters running this experiment gave us the opportunity to learn and suggest improvements to our program, and we’d like to share some improvements below.\n\n----------\n\n**What went well?**\n\n-   Support the Hackers. Participating in so many hackathons this year gave us the opportunity to meet many talented individuals and groups with superb ideas, to which integrating Push made a lot of sense. And furthermore many of these hackers work on some of the most reputable projects in the space, and they are taking all the learnings after they integrate Push to their own projects.\n-   Variety in the Grants. Being an Infrastructure protocol it’s easy to focus on development grants. However, we also met content producers with their own audiences and even provided multi-language knowledge sharing about Push in their own communities. More recently there has been more interest from educational platforms to include Push as a part of their cohorts.\n-   Playing with DAOs. There are many DAOs aiming to provide their members with all the help possible to build their projects. Collaborating with these DAOs has given the exposure of our Grants Program to many developers.\n\n**Where do we need to improve?**\n\n-   The PGP process as defined originally started with the forum, where every PGP needed to be posted following a template until enough traction was gained to go to the polling phase, and finally to voting in the Snapshot. Making the entire process sluggish in some cases.\n-   Push was offering companionship to Grantees not only in financial form but also by putting our social channels at their service to share about their projects with our community. Inviting Grantees to join us in our bi-weekly Friday Push calls, Office hours, and even highlighting them in our monthly and weekly newsletters. However, we want to do it even better. Meaning supporting projects with marketing, intros, and more. We’ll improve our support for grantees to succeed.\n\n----------\n\n## Enter Push Grants Program v2.0 (”PGP v2.0”)\n\nIn an effort to make our Push Grants Program process more useful, faster, and engaging for everyone that decides to participate in it; we are suggesting the following changes in the process:\n\n[![image](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard11/uploads/epns/optimized/1X/3bc691bfce0d411baf2d2178479f890e869cec4d_2_690x255.png)](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard11/uploads/epns/original/1X/3bc691bfce0d411baf2d2178479f890e869cec4d.png \"image\")\n\nimage1119×415 33.7 KB\n\n1.  Every Proposal starts by submitting an application through the  **Grants Proposal Form**  (which will be made public if this proposal passes) and ensuring all information is complete and accurate. This information will be publicly available on the  **Push**  **Grants public portal**.\n2.  Next step is each proposal being reviewed by the  **Push Grants Committee**. This is a group of Push members from different areas who will get together to analyze each proposal to ensure it meets the criteria, and communicate with the proposer in case adjustments needs to be made or move the proposal forward to the next stage.\n3.  Depending on the size of the grant there are different approaches to take:\n    1.  **Push**  **Rapid Grants**  (For grants not greater than $2,000 USD): This is a faster process that involves reviewing the grant, and after internal deliberation supporting the grant or asking for adjustments. The turnaround time ranges from 1 week to 2 weeks.\n    2.  **Push Grants**  (For grants not greater than $20,000 USD)**:**  still, a fast process where after the initial review the candidates will be scheduled for an interview with the Push Grants Committee to answer questions, receive suggestions, and talk about milestone tracking.\n    3.  **Push Community Grants**  (For grants greater than $20,000 USD): a slightly slower process for larger grants where after the initial review and subsequent interview, candidates are asked to post their proposal in the forum for temperature check (following the predefined guidelines from PGP v1.0 and skipping the polling phase as this step will not be necessary anymore), and if it all goes well then go to formal voting in the snapshot.\n\nWe believe implementing this new process will improve the speed at which Push Grants Proposals get executed, and create a healthy feedback loop for Push and Grantees.  \n  \n\n**Other considerations with this new process**\n\n-   Milestones verification. A very important lesson learned during this first iteration is how to implement accountability with grantees through milestone verification. All milestone goals and achievements will be clearly documented in the public portal and be used as a mechanism to confirm that the grant is on the right track. Of course, projects are living creatures, and its understandable that changes might happen, however good documentation and milestones definition should provide validation for grants.\n-   ThePush Committee. We propose the initial committee for this 2nd iteration to be formed initially by Push team members from different areas (Development, Growth, DAO, and Marketing). It will be a committee of 6 members: 1 lead and 5 reviewers. With the lead ensuring the program runs well and optimizations are taken care of as opportunities arise.\n\n----------\n\n## Conclusion\n\nAs mentioned above its in our best interest to support the Push Grants recipients to the best of our capabilities, providing them better companionship in terms of marketing, intros to other projects, development consultation, and suggesting improvements for their grants to have better chances of being approved and reaching a higher impact and exposure with our community and others.\n\nThis PGIP (Push Governance Improvement Proposal) aims to be fast tracked according to  [PIP- 08 Fast-tracking of PIP’s that get Immediate traction into Snapshot](https://gov.push.org/t/pip-08-fast-tracking-of-pip-s-that-get-immediate-traction-into-snapshot/707).\n\nIf feedback is positive and this proposal is ratified, the new Push Grants Program structure will become effective immediately, and new proposals and/or proposals in early stages in the forum.\n\nPush Grants Program v2.0 serves an even bigger purpose as it also places Push Protocol in a strategic point to start exploring more DAO2DAO collaboration opportunities, and have direct access to the most important developer groups to implement Push Protocol features.\n\nLet’s keep PUSHing.",

One of the Apps built on top of this protocol is rapidXPay. Think of this App as a decentralized PayPal but with Zero transaction cost both to payer and merchant!

The upcoming public incentivized testnet version 1.0 removes the fee completely. )\n\n![](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard11/uploads/epns/original/1X/6e7e134cb239e87de78bdda129d529a9a15e228e.png)[ethglobal.com](https://ethglobal.com/showcase/rapidx-decentralized-paypal-psqmh)\n\n![](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard11/uploads/epns/original/1X/b77f89c317e11399903cf90ff107bd8b19c17084.jpeg)\n\n### [](https://gov.push.org/t/pgp-proposal-rapidx-protocol-epns/864/9#rapidx-decentralized-paypal-ethglobal-httpsethglobalcomshowcaserapidx-decentralized-paypal-psqmh-1)[RapidX (Decentralized Paypal) | ETHGlobal](https://ethglobal.com/showcase/rapidx-decentralized-paypal-psqmh)\n\nPaypal Killer - Revolutionizing the cross border payments through web3.0 payment rails\n\nFor Hands-On, please refer to links at Section 12.\n\n\n\n5.  **Proposal Category**  \n    Defi\n    \n6.  **Project Overview**\n    \n\nOur Vision is to make sending/receiving money across the world real-time at zero transaction cost. Towards this vision, we are building the first ever Blockchain Based Incentivized Payments Protocol and also an application that is powered by this protocol. Users of the App can send/receive money from across the world for FREE and INSTANTLY. We believe that by solving real world problems, mass adoption to blockchain tech will be achieved.\n\nOur solution is built on principles of decentralization, meaning the users own the network. Users to the network are the Liquidity providers(LPs), payers, merchants, bridges and frontends. LPs can put their idle cash to work by adding liquidity to Isolated single sided currency pools. Anyone i.e, individual, HNIs, Corporates etc. can easily add liquidity in their domestic currency.\n\nCore Architecture:  \nA Cross border transaction is broken into two domestic transactions and are in turn connected by the rapidX smart contract suite. All rent seeking intermediaries are done away with. Open Banking APIs are used to connect TradFi to DeFi. Flow of funds involves following steps:\n\n1.  Payer sends fiat currency from his/her bank account to the rapidX bridge.\n2.  Bridge tokenizes the fiat currency to digital currency and submits the transaction to blockchain\n3.  Smart contract uses the rapidX adaptive AMM to convert the currency to recipient/merchant’s preferred currency.\n4.  Recipient receives the digital currency in his wallet\n5.  Recipient can convert the digital currency to fiat currency using rapidX Bridge.\n\nAdaptive AMM powers the currency conversion. Adaptive AMM ensures Auto and Self rebalancing of pools through dynamic fx conversion rate setting(formula driven) based on supply and demand of the currency. Some transactions receive cashbacks if such transactions help balancing an unbalanced pool. Smart Contract maintains a cashback incentive pool.\n\nThe rapidXPay App works seamlessly for non-blockchain native users as well. In fact having a blockchain wallet is only optional to senders (but we encourage users to create wallet to receive loyalty tokens).\n\nHow ZERO transaction fee is ensured?  \nTransaction involves following processes: On-ramp, tokenization, currency conversion and payment transmission. We strive to achieve zero costs at each of these processes.  \n(1) ZERO On-ramp/Off-ramp Fee: By using open banking APIs, we reduce/remove the on-ramp fee involved in sending the fiat currency to rapidX bridge. In the demo App, we have integrated with UPI for INR. As a result, the onramp fee is zero.\n\n(2) ZERO Tokenization Fee: Bridges earn revenue through interest rates as they custody the FIAT currency and hence are sustainable without imposing any tokenization fees.\n\n(3) ZERO Transmission fees: Polygon L2 blockchain is used which has near zero gas fee and hence the payment transmission costs are abysmal, especially when compared with TradFi payment giants such as PayPal which charge around 4%\n\n(4) Wholesale Currency Conversion rate: Now retailers can enjoy wholesale fx rates which are hitherto accessible only to big corporates. This unfair advantage is dismantled removing the competitive disadvantage to retailers/small merchants.\n\n(5) Cashbacks and Loyalty Tokens: Additionally, payers can receive cashbacks (or upfront discounts) and loyalty tokens when they undertake transactions that strengthen the protocol.\n\nProtocol revenue and benefits to LP:  \nrapidX protocol borrows the liquidity from the liquidity pool at inter-bank rate and converts the currency at wholesale rate. This small margin generates revenue to smart contract for every transaction. 50% of the revenue goes to LPs and 50% goes to treasury. The protocol strives to maintain wholesale rate for every transaction on an average but the actual rate may sometimes be higher or lower than the wholesale rate depending on the demand and supply to ensure automated pool balancing.  \nLPs earn real and sustainable yield by deploying their idle cash. LPs can earn anything between 15-25% APR assuming a utilization rate of 20-30%. Additionally, LPs and other users can mine loyalty tokens when they undertake certain activities that strengthen the protocol.\n\nGovernance:  \nDecentralized governance with voting power represented through Loyalty tokens(ERC20). Treasury is also governed through voting.\n\nCurrent Status:  \nWe have built an MVP during the ETHOnline Hackathon 2022 in September. For MVP we have implemented the Application with tokenization, smart contracts and adaptive AMM with Cash Backs. We have also implemented communication layer through PUSH notifications. Merchant getting payment confirmation notifications and Merchant sending exclusive offers to those opted in users who pay with rapidX.  \n(In MVP V1.0 imposes a very small fee. The upcoming public testnet version removes the fee completely.)  \nWe are thankful and honored to receive some prizes including from PUSH team.  \nPlease have a look at our demo video:\n\n![](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard11/uploads/epns/original/1X/6e7e134cb239e87de78bdda129d529a9a15e228e.png)[ethglobal.com](https://ethglobal.com/showcase/rapidx-decentralized-paypal-psqmh)\n\n![](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard11/uploads/epns/original/1X/b77f89c317e11399903cf90ff107bd8b19c17084.jpeg)\n\n### [](https://gov.push.org/t/pgp-proposal-rapidx-protocol-epns/864/9#rapidx-decentralized-paypal-ethglobal-httpsethglobalcomshowcaserapidx-decentralized-paypal-psqmh-2)[RapidX (Decentralized Paypal) | ETHGlobal](https://ethglobal.com/showcase/rapidx-decentralized-paypal-psqmh)\n\nPaypal Killer - Revolutionizing the cross border payments through web3.0 payment rails\n\nWe also invite you to try our demo and provide your feedback (links provided in the Relevant Links section)\n\nWhat we are doing Currently? :  \n(1) Building a Incentivized TestNet V1.0 to enable real users to try.

      "content": "Link to [Proposal Draft on Governance Forum](https://gov.push.org/t/pgp-proposal-push-epns-academy/832/15)\n\n\n1. Project Name - Push(EPNS) Academy by DoDAO\n\n2. Email -  [robinnagpal@dodao.io](mailto:robinnagpal@dodao.io)\n\n3. About You\nI have 15 years of development experience and currently working with many web3 protocol on educational efforts.\n\n4. Project TL:DR\nThe ENPS Academy will provide developers and non-technical individuals with the tools and resources they need to know about EPNS and how it can be used to best integrate it into their protocols. This academy will be beneficial for those who want to understand EPNS in greater detail and how it can be used to empower their protocols.\n\n\tWe want to create six guides which will empower developers and non-technical people to understand EPNS so they can integrate it into their protocols\n\n5. Proposal Category \n\tEducational\n\n6. Project Overview\n\n\t**Summary**\n\n\tEPNS is a solution for users not receiving notifications or updates - an issue which is currently a gap in the web3 ecosystem.\n\n\tThe ENPS Academy will provide developers and non-technical individuals with the tools and resources they need to know about EPNS and how it can be used to best integrate it into their protocols. This academy will be beneficial for those who want to understand EPNS in greater detail and how it can be used to empower their protocols.\n\n\tWe want to create six guides which will empower developers and non-technical people to understand EPNS so they can integrate it into their protocols. These guides will lay out a strong foundation and introduce the most important topics related to EPNS.\n\n\t**Why Guides?**\n\n\tENPS Academy will be built on top of the DoDAO platform. The DoDAO platform offers interactive guides that are more engaging than traditional documentation. Some of the key features of these guides include:\n\n\t1.  The ability to add questions which make learning more interactive\n\t    \n\t2.  Wallet login\n\t    \n\t3.  The ability to reward with Tokens or NFT\n\t    \n\t4.  Discord integration\n\t    \n\t5.  Adding form fields to capture user’s information\n\t    \n\t**Past Work**\n\n\tSome of our other partner academy websites\n\n\taave.academy\n\n\tprojectserum.academy\n\n\tensdomains.academy\n\n\tHere is a detailed demo of our academy websites -\n\n\tNote: Courses shown on partner academy sites are just placeholders. They will be replaced with specific partner courses.\n\n\t**Deliverables**\n\n\tAs part of the grant, DoDAO will be delivering the following six guides\n\n\t1.  What is EPNS?\n\t2.  EPNS Architecture - Talks about how EPNS works. Covers channels, notifications, smart contracts, push nodes etc.\n\t3.  Setting up a Channel\n\t4.  Notification Entities - Talk about all the major entities involved in user notifications like Channels, Subscriptions, Feeds etc.\n\t5.  Push SDK - Talks about various packages within push-sdk and how developers can use these packages\n\t6.  Showrunners Framework - How developers can use showrunners framework to build out notifications for their use cases.\n\t7. Push Governance -  **PGIP**  (Push Governance Improvement Proposals) and  **PIP**  (Push Improvement Proposals) and about Grants\n    8. Contributing to Push Academy\n\t\n    Each of these guides will be very detailed with\n    \n\t-   3-5 content steps\n\t-   10-15 questions per guide\n\t-   Nice thumbnails\n    \t\n    \t\n    \t\n\n\n7. Value Proposition to Push \n\tThe guides and courses on DoDAO’s platform are designed to be highly interactive, so that users can get the most out of their learning experience. Our goal is to create a decentralized academy website that produces graduates/ambassadors who can then educate others about Push(EPNS).\n    \n    Push Academy will provide developers and non-technical individuals with the tools and resources they need to know about Push(EPNS) and how it can be used to best integrate it into their protocols. This academy will be beneficial for those who want to understand Push in greater detail and how it can be used to empower their protocols.\n\n8. Funding Requested\nWe request a grant of $650 per guide i.e. $5200 (20,740 $PUSH as of 11/14/2022). 8 guides in total.\n\n9. Funding Breakdown and Milestones\nAll the guides will be completed in 4-6 weeks of times. We are completely flexible to update in it whatever way you want.  \n\t**Milestone 1 - Guides**  \n\t1. What is EPNS?  \n\t2. EPNS Architecture - Talks about how EPNS works. Covers channels, notifications, smart contracts, push nodes etc.  \n\t3. Setting up a Channel\n\n\t**Milestone 2 - Guides**  \n\t4. Notification Entities - Talk about all the major entities involved in user notifications like Channels, Subscriptions, Feeds etc.  \n\t5. Push SDK - Talks about various packages within push-sdk and how developers can use these packages  \n\t6. Showrunners Framework - How developers can use showrunners framework to build out notifications for their use cases.  \n\t**Mile Stone 3 - Guides**  \n\t7. Push Governance -  **PGIP**  (Push Governance Improvement Proposals) and  **PIP**  (Push Improvement Proposals) and about Grants  \n\t8.

      "content": "Link to [Proposal Draft on Governance Forum](https://gov.push.org/t/pgp-proposal-spect-epns/830/11)\n\n 1. **Project Name**\n\n\tSpect\n\n2. **Email**\n\n\t[adityachakra16@gmail.com](mailto:adityachakra16@gmail.com)\n\n3. **About you**\nWebsite: [https://spect.network/](https://spect.network/)\n\n4. **Project TL;DR**\n\n\tSpect is a highly customizable tool for DAO contributors to form circles (or sub-DAOs) that manage grants, bounties and tasks. On Spect, it is also possible to send kudos (soulbound tokens) to contributors and reward contributors on multiple EVM networks using any token. Contributors can even distribute retroactive rewards among each other in a decentralized and fair way.\n\n5. **Proposal Category**\n\n\tDAO tooling\n\n6. **Project Overview**\n\n\tProblem Statement\n\n\tAs DAOs scale to larger number of contributors, it is naturally becoming harder and harder to maintain a shared sense of context among all contributors. This has led to the formation of sub-DAOs and guilds. However, most of the current tooling to manage grants, bounties and tasks, distribute rewards and make decisions are built for monolithic DAOs instead of sub-DAOs. Moreover, these tools are point solution which means each tool serves a specific purpose. Therefore, with every addition of a new tool for a new use case, there is a loss of context among contributors.\n\n\tAbout Spect\n\n\tAt Spect, our goal is to centralize context while at the same time decentralize decision making. To do this, we have built a tool for DAOs to form circles (or sub-DAOs) that manage grants, bounties and tasks. A tool that can also be used by contributors to fund each other and build their on-chain resume with soulbound tokens.\n\n\tOur accomplishments till now\n\n\t-   **On Spect, it is now possible to create circles N levels deep**. This allows  **DAOs to easily modularize and scale**  by forming sub-DAOs and guilds with their own treasury, roles and integrations.\n\t-   It is possible to form  **highly customizable workflows**  on Spect. Each workflow gets their own filters and views! Views include Kanban, List, Gantt and Table.\n\t-   **Customizable roles!**  On Spect, it is possible to give each role  **granular permissions**  for various actions such as distributing rewards, updating project settings etc. Roles can even be  **mapped from Discord and Guild.xyz!**\n\t-   It is possible to  **reward contributors**  on Mainnet and multiple other EVM networks such as Polygon, Optimism, Arbitrum, Gnosis chain, Avalanche and BNB chain. Spect also supports  **payment using Gnosis safes**!\n\t-   **On-chain credentials!**  It is possible to give out  **non-transferrable soulbound tokens to contributors via Mintkudos**  directly from Spect.\n\t-   **Retroactive bonuses!**  Contributors in a circle can use retroactive bonuses to distribute a budget and recognize each other’s work.\n\t-   **Real-time collaboration**  in projects\n\t-   We’re live!\n\t-   Currently, we have 7 DAOs and just above 50 contributors who have created an account, out of which 12-15 are using it weekly.\n\n\tEarly Partners\n\n\tWe’re working closely with early partners such as Biconomy DAO to help build out their grant management process. We’re also running an Early Citizen’s Program with partner DAOs.\n\n\tFuture Product Roadmap\n\n\t-   Ultimate customizations, that allow circles to create forms, tables, kanbans and lists with cards containing custom properties\n\t-   Roleplace, allowing contributors to easily discover roles within circles and go through onboarding workflows to get these roles.\n\t-   Automated workflows to reduce redendant, busy-work in circles\n\t-   One-click circles, for anyone to come in and spin up a new circle with a click from templatized workflows, automations and roles.\n\n\tWhat else you should know about us\n\n\t-   We make weekly product updates on our discord server\n\t-   Our team comprises of three contributors\n\t    -   Chakra (me) - I’m a co-founder of Spect and lead partnerships and growth in Spect. I’m a full-stack software engineer with experience in both web2 and web3 technologies. Currently, I am working full time on Spect. I’m also a member of other communities such as Developer DAO.  \n\t        [adityachakra16 (Aditya Chakraborty) · GitHub](https://github.com/adityachakra16)\n\t        \n\t    -   Avp - A co-founder of Spect, leading product and technology. Full-stack software engineer with experience in both web2 and web3 technologies. Currently, also full-time on Spect and also a member of Developer DAO.  \n\t        [avp1598 · GitHub](https://github.com/avp1598)\n\t        \n\t    -   Reshma - Leads the creative direction of Spect. Also, a full-stack software engineer with experience in both web2 and web3 technologies. Currently, part-time on Spect and also a member of Developer DAO.  \n\t        [TheReshma (Reshma ) · GitHub](https://github.com/TheReshma)\n        \n\n7. **Value Proposition to Push Protocol**\n\n\tWe believe this grant will be the start of a long term relationship between Push Protocol and Spect. Currently, there are two major value propositions to Push Protocol\n\n\t1.  We are building tools to help DAOs form circles and improve internal workflows and attract more contributors through grants, bounties and well-defined roles and onboarding workflows. Spect can help Push Protocol create workflows and automate these workflows over time. Push Protocol contributors can even fund each other on Spect using Coordinape-style retroactive rewards.\n\t2.  We are looking to add push notifications on Spect where Push Protocol naturally fits in quite well. Push Protocol is automatically exposed to more DAOs and DAO contributors through Spect.\n\n8. **Funding Requested**\n\n\t$10,000 (31300 PUSH as of 10/07)\n\n9. **Funding Breakdown and Milestones**\n\n\tAt Spect, we’re focused on solving for use cases. This is why the following milestones contain information about the use case first and then some features needed to achieve them.\n\n\tMilestone 1: Push Protocol creates a seamless grant management workflow\n\n\tCurrently, circles (sub-DAOs) can setup their grant management workflows on Spect. This allows circles to do the following.\n\n\t-   Add all the approved grantees in a kanban board or a table and make sure that there is always a bird’s eye view of all the approved grantees. Grantees can provide monthly updates here and also add other comments.\n\t-   Add all milestones in a normalized way for all grantees in a kanban board or a table. This can be used to track status of different milestones and pay grantees once a milestone is completed using native DAO tokens from a multi-sig.\n\t-   Form grantee circles and relate them to the parent circle (grantor’s circle, in this case Push). This allows grantees to form their circles and manage tasks related to the grants program\n\t-   Automate the grant application to grant management setup. We’ve recently integrated Questbook such that once a grant application is approved, the applicant and milestones are automatically added on the grant management circle.\n\n\tIn the near future, we want to enable the following for circles\n\n\t-   Standardized grant application form and response tracking on Spect.\n\t-   A place to have discourse about grant applications and vote on them\n\t-   Notification on the following\n\t    -   When an application is submitted, notification is sent to stewards of the circle\n\t    -   When an application is approved, notification is sent to the grantee\n\t    -   When periodic updates are added, notification is sent to grant managers\n\t    -   When a milestone is completed, notification is sent to grant managers\n\t    -   When payment is disbursed, notification is sent to grantee\n\n\tDuring this milestone our goal is also to reach 15 DAOs and 170 contributors.\n\n\tFunding Ask - 15650 PUSH\n\n\tExpected Timeline - 2 months\n\n\tMilestone 2: Push Protocol creates onboarding workflows to various circles within it\n\n\tCurrently, on Spect, the following is possible for new contributors to onboard to a circle.\n\n\t-   Circle can have roles that are mapped from Discord or Guild.xyz\n\t-   Each role has a granular set of permissions that allows a circle member to take several actions within the circle\n\t-   Contributors can claim these roles and become part of the circle. Upon claiming, they have permissions to take actions within the circle such as disburse payments, review tasks, manage circle settings etc\n\n\tIn the near future, we want to enable the following for circles\n\n\t-   Permissioned onboarding to circles using application forms, such that when an applicant applies for a role within a circle, the existing circle members can vote or vouch for the new applicant to join the circle\n\t-   Onboarding workflow containing bounties for skill-based roles. A circle can create a set of bounties which new contributors would need to successfully complete to be onboarded to a circle. These bounties could include development work, writing content summaries etc.\n\t-   Notification on the following\n\t    -   When a new application is submitted, notification is sent to stewards of the circle\n\t    -   When an applicant completes a bounty, notification is sent to reviewer of the bounty. When reviewer accepts submission or asks for revision, notification is sent to the applicant.\n\t    -   When a new member is added to circle, other members in the circle are notified\n\n\tDuring this milestone our goal is also to reach 25 DAOs and 350 contributors.\n\n\tFunding Ask - 15650 PUSH\n\n\tExpected Timeline - 2 months\n\n\tPlease also note the following\n\n\t-   These use cases that we build for Push Protocol automatically are also available to other DAOs using Spect, thus leading to more exposure of Push Protocol itself through our notification system.\n\t-   The above milestones are in no particular order, ie, it may be the case that Milestone 2 is completed before Milestone 1. This is because both of these have common primitives and will be worked on parallely. Hence, the expected time added here (2 months) is a cumulative time containing both milestones.\n\n10. **Wallet Address**\n\n\tMulti-sig on Ethereum - 0xF1b05f78940D774Aabfb6fCAe1ec883d04036Ab7\n\n\tMulti-sig on Polygon - 0xCE02ab993338c9a977e6f93fcFdB0e39090E0Df2\n\n11. **Relevant Links**  \n\tWebsite -  [https://spect.network/](https://spect.network/)  \n\tApp -  [https://circles.spect.network/](https://circles.spect.network/)  \n\tManifesto -  [Manifesto — Spect](https://mirror.xyz/chaks.eth/us5rOm1jSsvmvqBOmef_SZSP6zzbNeo7ay-_DkacC64)  \n\tTwitter -  [https://twitter.com/JoinSpect  1](https://twitter.com/JoinSpect)  \n\tDiscord -  [Spect Community](https://discord.gg/AF2qRMMpZ9)\n\n12. **Referral**\n\n\tJaf, DAO Lead  **@ Push Protocol**\n\n",

      "content": "Link to [Proposal Draft on Governance Forum](https://gov.push.org/t/pgp-proposal-dzap-epns/734)\n\n\n#### 1. Project Name\nDZap\n\n#### 2. Email\ngrants@dzap.io\n\n#### 3. About You\n- Shivam Chopra (Co-Founder): Blockchain developer since 2017, co-Founder @propelxyz Android developer since 2013, previously @gojektech @newscorp @AndroidStarters\nEmail: shivam@dzap.io\nTwitter: shivamdev31\nLinkedin: shivamdev\n\n- Akansha Jain (COO): Managing @propelxyz. Also, an analyst and content writer.\nEmail: akansha@dzap.io\nTwitter: Akanshajain05\nLinkedIn: akansha-jain-734226154\n\n- Rajat Seth (CMO) - 4+ years of WorkEx in Media Industry (Hindustan Times & DishTV) in Content & Social Media Domain.\nEmail - rajat@propel.xyz\nLinkedIn - rajatseth03\nTwitter - Sudpines\n\n#### 4. Project TL;DR\nWith DZap one can Buy, Sell, or Send multiple tokens & NFTs in a single transaction. Basically, our goal is to unify multiple-step process into one. In the future, we are set to release Dollar Cost Averaging (DCA) and other features as well.\n\n#### 5. Proposal Category\n- Defi\n- NFT\n- DEX\n\n#### 6. Project Overview\n\n###### Parts that are complete:\n\n1. Batch Buy: Batch Buy feature enables users to purchase many tokens in a single transaction. In other words, you can buy all the tokens you need at once without having to buy them one at a time. Through Batch Buy, you can “Convert one token to multiple tokens” i.e #onetomany.\n2. Batch Sell: Batch Sell feature enables users to sell one than one token in a single transaction. In other words, you can sell any number of tokens at once without having to swap one at a time. Through Batch Sell, you can “Convert multiple token to one token”\ni.e #manytoone.\n3. Batch Send: Batch Send feature allows user to send multiple tokens to an address in a single transaction.\n\n###### Under Development:\n\n1. Dollar Cost Averaging (DCA): DCA is a long-term strategy, where an investor regularly buys smaller amounts of an asset over a period of time, no matter the price (for example, investing $100 in Bitcoin every month for a year, instead of $1,200 at once). DZap is building a Decentralised DCA approach so that user can start investing without any KYC process. We would introduce LP token and crypto basket to DCA as well.\n2. Multi-to-multi: Through this feature, user will be able to Buy/sell multiple token into other multiple tokens.\n3. NFT Aggregator: Buy/Sell/Send feature for Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs).\n\n###### Budget & Allocation:\n \n![dzap budget.png](ipfs://bafkreif7th6xh5y7pe5ayr4syhvpcjbsrerlaep6tms75wn2b6qyyb6kze)\n    \n#### 7. Value Proposition to EPNS\n EPNS is a Notification Protocol which enables users (wallet addresses) to receive notifications. Since, DZap is a B2C project and deals with token/NFT trading and investing, EPNS would be a central notification layer of DZap. We tend to following push notifications:\n\n1. Feature & other updates will be notified through EPNS.\n2. $PUSH will be set as a default token in our ‘Token List”\n3. Notification about user’s DCA position will be pushed through EPNS.\n\nEPNS community members would be given priority updates about new features going live on DZap. We will also be posting on our social channels about EPNS to spread awareness about the protocol.\n\n#### 8. Funding Requested\n###### 33,921 $PUSH \n(~ $10,000 considering the [closing price on 24 Oct 2022](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/epns/historical-data/) )\n\n#### 9. Milestones\n##### Phase 1 (Completed)\n\n- Ideation and team building.\n- UX/UI prototypes.\n- MVP of the website with “Batch Buy” & “Batch Sell” feature of tokens.\n- Aggregation of various DEX for liquidity.\n- Integration of different Blockchain & wallet options.\n- Auditing of smart contracts & Quality Assessment of the entire product.\n- Release of Beta version with commission fees at 0% i.e FREE.\n- Applying for grants and funds.\n\n##### Phase 2 (WIP). Timeline for completion: Q4 2022\n\n- Release “Batch Send” feature of tokens.\n- Release V1 of Dollar Cost Averaging (DCA).\n- Integration of dashboard with features like “User profile, notification, and transaction history”.\n- Release Batch Selling/Buying/Sending feature of Non Fungible Tokens (NFTs).\n- Aggregation of various marketplaces.\n- Second phase of auditing & quality test.\n- Prototyping “Convert Multiple tokens into other multiple tokens”\n\n##### Phase 3 (WIP): Timeline for completion: Q1 2023\n\n- Introduction of “Crypto Basket”.\n- Improvisation of features according to user feedbacks & feature requests.\n- MVP for “Cross-chain staking”\n- Third phase of auditing and quality test.\n\n##### Few Notification Usecases\n1. For DCA specifically we can use notifications for the following:\n- To notify users about their ongoing DCA & also the user can decide the interval at which notification should pop.\n- Notify users about the completion of the ongoing DCA whilst give the option of continuing the same.\n2.  User can also create price notification:\n- buy/sell a tokens at certain price\n- he may want to start/stop the DCA at certain price\n- for NFTs, sweeping floor at a certain price\n3. In DZap, Batch buy/sell/send happens immediately like any other DEX. Here, we want to use EPNS to notify the users about the stats like: most swapped token, top 10 token, batch bought/sold, NFT floor sweeps, etc.\n4. We are focussed to use the same notification patterns for both tokens/coins and NFTs (batch buy/sell/send & floor sweep of NFTs)\n\n#### 10.

      "content": "Link to [Proposal Draft on Governance Forum](https://gov.epns.io/t/codemire-epns-notifications-on-cross-ip-pvp-gamefi-ecosystem/648)\n\n\n#### 1. Project Name\nLYNC\n\n#### 2. Email\nvishwas@codemire.com\n\n#### 3. About You\n- Vishwas Bhushan: I am the Co-Founder of Codemire and have been in the NFT space for more than one and half years with the access of over 200K+ NFT community on Twitter. Have sold over 1000+ NFT artworks and know the importance of community in the web3 and NFT space.\nI have handled the Community at Wishfie with Durgesh Kaushik. I have lead the design and front end at Essentially sports. Have launched multiple hyper-casual games and scaled them up to 100K downloads in a month.\nPartnered with Animetas in Animonkeys game. Have got featured in NEAR insider, BlockTalks as one of the top $NEAR influencers. I have teamed up with JF_NFT, Real Miss NFT, and various NFT OGs to uplift the NFT artist and NFT community. I am also a core team member of OG CLUB DAO. With codemire, the vision is to deliver the best gaming experience to anyone entering the web3 space.\nEmail: vishwas@codemire\nTwitter: @BhushanVishwas\nDiscord: VISH ΞNFT#5026\n\n- Shanu Joshi: Shanu is an app, game, and blockchain developer, running a game studio for the past 3 years and have been in the Web3 space for more than 12 months.

Project TL;DR\nWe are creating the first NFT Gaming metaverse where users can play games with their NFT avatars and our main focus is more on the gaming experience.\n\n#### 5. Proposal Category\n- Defi\n- NFT\n- Gaming\n\n#### 6. Project Overview\nAt LYNC, we are letting the NFTs fight with each other for the best gaming experience. As of right now most of the game P2E games ignore the gaming experience. Our MVP is ready where multiple players can play and compete with each other with their NFTs as game avatars. Our next goal is the work on NFT lending and collateral token transaction.\nWe believe that notifications play a very important role in any gaming ecosystem, this allows gamers to stay updated and that’s why we chose EPNS to send web3 notifications.\n\n#### 7. Value Proposition to EPNS\nOur main goal is not just to create a gamefi ecosystem but our goal is to let NFT communities clash with each other by providing the best gaming experience which allows the gamers and various NFT communities to play and earn at the same time. This will result in the wide use of the EPNS by the gamers and NFT community, because as of now most of the Play to Earn ignores the power of notification and hence the power of EPNS, to create a hook effect among the community.\n\n#### 8.

As we grow closer to making EPNS a DAO, it becomes imperative to involve the community in technical decisions. \n\nThe web3 developer community is very familiar with the Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs). So following similar standards, it is proposed to use Push Improvement Proposals (PIPs) to describe the technical standards/improvements of the EPNS protocol.\n\nProposals on the Governance side will then take on a new name of **PGIP** i.e, **Push Governance Improvement Proposal**. \n\n## Conclusion\nIf this proposal gets ratified PIPs will be used to describe technical standards/improvements and PGIPs will be the go-to place for Governance proposals.\n\n",

      "content": "## Link to Forum Discussion\nhttps://gov.epns.io/t/pip-09-contributor-rewards-for-push-community-with-coordinape/725\n\n## Background\nThis proposal is to enable & allocate funds for community contributor rewards between the EPNS Internal Team and users in recognition of their contributions. Within the Coordinape dapp, the EPNS and Push Governance internal teams will allocate $PUSH tokens to regular contributors.\n\n## Proposal Description\n### EPNS Push Circle\nThe EPNS Push Circle within the Coordinape dapp is a tool for users to get recognized for their ongoing contributions. There will be a selection of EPNS internal team members who are going to allocate $PUSH tokens to the eligible users who have been added to the circle. This gives the community another way to be rewarded for their various contributions to the protocol and EPNS project as a whole.\n\n[Coordinape](https://coordinape.com/) allows users to sign in with their wallets, announce to the circle what they’ve been working on, and then receive tip allocations for their efforts. There are epochs set and admins are assigned a number of tokens at the beginning of each epoch to tip with. At the end of each epoch, Coordinape generates a report with results showing allocations per user, it does not then send those tips and the epoch allocations are not tied to users’ real balances. The tool is to enable community tipping and recognition, the actual transactions must be sent outside the tool.\n\nSince this tool requires that extra transaction flow level we also need to define how we want to develop that process.\n\n### User Addition\nFor this first iteration of Coordinape epochs, allow a vouching system where EPNS Internal Team/admins can nominate and vouch for new users from the community based on the requirements of the respective epoch & the quality of contributions. Each epoch would have a few focused roles defined such as Discord Moderator, Developer Relations Advocate, Ambassadors, etc… that could help in the growth of EPNS. This would require a process in place for users to apply and some qualifications set to make it a fair process.\n\nHowever, as the EPNS Push Circle matures, the vouching & nomination could be expanded to all the circle members.\n\n### Token Allocation\n#### We propose to allocate a total of 50,000 $PUSH tokens for a period of 6 months (1 epoch = 1 month).\n\nOut of the 50,000 PUSH, 20,000 PUSH will be transferred upfront to the team and the rest 30,000 PUSH will be locked and released to the team at the rate of 6000 PUSH per month over the next 5 months. Any unallocated amount of PUSH by the end of 6 months would be sent back to the community treasury.\n\nThe amount allocated for each epoch would be set by the admins based on the roles & the number of people added to the circle. However, to give assurance to the community and to keep the initiative attractive, the admin must ensure to allocate a minimum amount of $1000 USD worth of $PUSH tokens for each epoch.\n\nThis tool doesn’t send out tip allocations at the end of epochs or assign balances to distribute based on wallet balances. The admin users allocate the total tokens assigned per user at the beginning of each epoch.\n\nShould the community decide to fund this, allocate a set amount of tokens to EPNS Internal Team/admins and require they each send out their allocations to community members only.\n\n(ex. Team members allocated 100 $PUSH and users are only allowed to receive.)\n\n## Conclusion\nIf this proposal gets approved the suggested $PUSH Token allocation will be used to manage community contributions through our Coordinape implementation.\n\n",

      "content": "## Link to Forum Discussion\nhttps://gov.epns.io/t/pip-08-fast-tracking-of-pip-s-that-get-immediate-traction-into-snapshot/707\n\n## Background\nAt present all proposals should pass through 2 phases for them to be advanced to snapshot, adding up to a minimum duration of 10 days. This proposal aims to reduce the threshold and push a proposal that has been well received by the community directly to snapshot.\n\n## Proposal Description\nTo increase efficiency and allow for faster implementation and execution of important well-received proposals that got immediate traction within the community, this proposal intends to implement a fast-track framework for these types of proposals.\n\n#### Suggested fast-track process :\n\nStep 1 - Post the proposal in the Governance Proposals forum\n\nStep 2- Proposal must receive a minimum of 7 likes and 5 comments in favor in the first 48hrs of being added to the forum.\n\nStep 3 - The proposal will be assigned a PIP number in the discussion forum and be promoted to Snapshot without staying for discussion from the community.\n\nStep 4 - Snapshot with immediate vote open for 3 days\n\nThis allows proposals that pique the interest of the community to not lose steam and stay in limbo until it satisfies the prevalent requirements.\n\n#### Suggested scope & limitations of the fast-track process :\n\nFast-track can only act on Push Improvement Proposals (PIP).\nFast-track requires a quorum (i.e 1% of total votes- ~ 153k PUSH as of 5 July 2022 )\nProposals that don’t meet the criteria will continue the standard flow.\nThe process should take a maximum of 5 days until a proposal is fully approved and ready for execution.\n\n#### Note:\n\nAs suggested above, a proposal requires 7 likes and 5 comments to proceed to a fast-track phase. For a comment to be considered the commenter must have a trust level of Basic or above. The proposee must also answer the questions posed by Member must be answered before the proposal is moved to snapshot. Trust levels are badges that a user can earn by being active in the community and engaging with different proposals. More information on trust levels can be found [here](https://blog.discourse.org/2018/06/understanding-discourse-trust-levels/). Community discussions related to the topic can be found on the link attached\n\n## Conclusion\nIf this proposal gets ratified, Proposals with 7 likes and 5 comments(in favor) in the first 48 hours on the forum would be forwarded to Snapshot voting.\n\n",

Project TL;DR\nInshaan is first ever web3 one-stop platform specifically designed for freelancers and gig-workers, that incorporates a profile rating system as a staking model(Proof of work), commission-free escrow smart contract and gig-aggregator models for freelancers.\n\nWith Inshaan staking mechanism, all community members who are expert in their respective domain can stake and vote on the portfolio of new freelancers and help them to not only rank better on the client side but also include new metrics for evaluation.\n\nIn return if the freelancer successfully complete 3-5 projects (decided based on the amount staked) the community member will be rewarded. This helps freelancers, especially the ones who are just starting out and find it very difficult to succeed as a freelancer.\n\n#### 5. Proposal Category\nTooling\n\n#### 6. Project Overview\n**PROBLEM STATEMENT & SOLUTION**\nAll of us must have come across this dilemma once in our lifetime that “YOU NEED JOB TO GET EXPERIENCE AND YOU NEED AN EXPERIENCE TO GET A JOB”, well not any more. From the vast amount of freelancer in the ever expanding space, new freelancer finds it difficult to land a client. That’s not it, client faces equally same problem trusting a new freelancer. Not only our profile rating system will help new freelancer to index better in the marketplace, it will also help clients to trust a new freelancer.\n\nSince we can see a number of platform being developed for different community to share the work, its getting very difficult to authenticate, cross check and see reviews of that particular individual. We can have a single portfolio design where an individual can link with multiple platform and share the link of the portfolio along with reviews and previous work record so as to maintain one single point of contact.\n\nTraditionally freelancing marketplace charges huge commission(up-to 40%) in between for escrow payment solution and are really biased towards clients in case of dispute. Inshaan also offers freelancer to make commission free escrow smart contract (In stable coins) with their clients and in case of disputes, community members can participate in the dispute resolution method and get rewarded in return.\n\nMany freelancing marketplace are emerging, which is ultimately good for the community but this leads to a new issue. A gig-worker has to stay active in every platform in order to reach out to clients. We understand that marketplace is a “Chicken and Egg” kind of situation so we have build a gig-aggregator module with gig search feature which will help freelancers to extract gigs from multiple sources to start with like freelancer[dot]com, Guru[dot]com, Peopleperhour[dot]com, Linkedin hiring post, Linkedin contractual jobs, HR & founders on LinkedIn and many more coming soon.\n\n**ABOUT INSHAAN IN SHORT**\nInshaan is first ever web3 one-stop platform specifically designed for freelancer, gig-workers, that incorporates a profile rating system as a staking model, commission free escrow smart contract and gig-aggregator models for freelancer.\n\n**OUR MISSION &VISION**\nTo make a contribution to the Gig-economy by making tools for the Developers, Creators, Freelancers, Solopreneurs , Experts, Content creators, Comedians, Artists, Influencers, Vbloggers, Youtubers and professionals of any other field who is trying to do something of their own. Our Vision is to be the Earth’s most Gig-workers eccentric company.\n\n**USER JOURNEY**\nNew freelancer > connect wallet > build portfolio > search for gigs through our gig aggregator or list in profile rating system and get rating and feedback (which will help them to rank better on the client-side) > get clients > make smart contracts > solve dispute through our dispute management system in case of dispute.\n\n#### 7. Value Proposition to EPNS\na. Smart Contract, staking, start and end will be announced through EPNS.\n\nb. Inshaan will have a chat service in future between admin, freelancer & clients, the proposal notification services will be powered by EPNS (Showrunner framework).\n\nc.

Project TL;DR\nTollan Worlds is a Free-To-Play accessible metaverse where MMORPG game mechanics blend with web3-driven 2D virtual worlds. Explore diverse, story-rich gameplay, interact with gamified DeFi, socialise with other players, and earn rewards by bringing value to the community.\n\n#### 5. Proposal Category\n- Defi\n- NFT\n- Tooling\n- Educational\n- Gaming\n\n#### 6. Project Overview\nOur mission in Tollan is to create an adventurous MMORPG where in addition to completing quests, gathering together with your friends for raids, and other RPG-native elements you could also build your own story, and dungeons, and even get rewarded for it. \n    \nIn Tollan we work together with various DAOs, DeFi protocols, and NFT projects to build quests where people not only get in-game utilities for interacting with protocols but also learn something in a non-invasive gamified way, we call it Play+Learn+Earn. Our mission is to bring Web3 gaming closer to the general audience by building a utility-driven DeFi layer on top of the core gameplay. Players can get rewards for staking, providing liquidity, contributing to DAOs, or creating NFTs. \n    \nWe are currently getting ready for our first alpha test where players will be able to complete quests, interact with gamified DeFi protocols, go to co-op PVE missions and simply explore the mysterious worlds of Tollan.\n    \nLearn about DAOs, DeFi, and NFTs in a variety of gamified experiences built together with our partners and get valuable collectibles. Our mission is to bring Web3 gaming closer to the general audience by building a utility-driven DeFi layer on top of the core gameplay. Players can get rewards for staking, providing liquidity, contributing to DAOs, and creating NFTs.\n    \nWe also have Tollan Comic: \nDive deeper into the lore of Tollan Worlds with our community-made comic book. The goal is not only to get readers acquainted with aesthetics, inhabitants, and other components of our Metaverse but also to demonstrate the importance of Web3 and its values through entertaining and collaborative storytelling\n\n#### 7. Value Proposition to EPNS\nIn our MMORPG gaming world, there is always something happening, and its easy to forget about some important aspects. You are casually walking through the mountains to slay that final lizard but you suddenly remember that you have only 20 more minutes to claim your reward for staking some tokens with that miner in a gold mine a while ago. Or you forgot about your agreement with fellow Wizards, Punks, and Apes to go on a co-op mission this evening, and already turned off your PC. And finally, there is this weekly tournament, and you could really use those prize money to get some more golden melons for your next quest, but exactly on this day, you’ve decided to take a day off the metaverse. \n    \nEPNS is a game-changer for keeping track of all things that are happening around the Worlds of Tollan. With EPNS, not a single Tollaners will now miss their regular reward from integrated DeFi protocols. Not a single event will be missed due to players being offline, and nobody will now have an excuse not to play with their teammates, cause they will receive a “call-to-action” notification straight to their EPNS app or extension.\n    \nTollan is already attracting more and more DeFi and NFT users, and further, we go, more focus would be put on the general gaming audience. We want to create the most smooth and simplest way to onboard people into the metaverse and web3, and this, therefore, will draw more attention to EPNS as a core mechanism of the in-game interaction layer.\n\n#### 8.

      "title": "PIP-07 : Reduce Proposal Quorum Threshold to 1% (IN FAVOR)",
      "content": "## Link to Forum Discussion\nhttps://gov.epns.io/t/pip-07-reduce-proposal-quorum-threshold-to-1-in-favor/659\n\n## Background\nThe quorum threshold to ratify a proposal at present is 4% of the circulating supply of $PUSH (~612k as of 23 June 2022). Here we propose to make an amendment to the Push Governance proposal ratification requirements, by reducing the quorum to 1%.\n\n## Proposal Description\nQuorum is a requirement that sets the minimum number of votes IN FAVOR that must be present for a proposal to get ratified. It exists so proposals can’t be shuttled through without a sufficient number of contributors casting votes.\n\nAt present, the quorum threshold to ratify a proposal is 4% of the circulating supply of $PUSH(~612k PUSH as of 23 June 2022). This threshold is defined in the Push Governance guidelines when it was launched in September 2021, [here](https://github.com/ethereum-push-notification-service/epns-governance/blob/main/governance-lifecycle.md). However, 4% was kept, expecting a much higher level of community engagement.\n\nNow, after promoting a good amount of proposals to Snapshot, we have a better picture of the engagement we can expect. Although most of the proposals in the past have met quorum on Snapshot, there was [this proposal](https://snapshot.org/#/epns.eth/proposal/0xcbb169a53d72a61997d107501af3f43ae39c1b334e4d58c7efa33e0e87b7cc3d), that failed to meet quorum in spite of good engagement from the community.\n\nHence, by learning from the experiences of other DAOs who had to reduce quorum when not-meeting-the-quorum affected the decision-making of governance, we propose to reduce the quorum threshold to 1% (~ 153k PUSH as of 23 June 2022) as a preventive measure.\n\nWhile this preventive measure ensures that most proposals are either passed or defeated, it really doesn’t affect the governance mechanism as the proposal still is there for 7 days so proposals that have gotten significant momentum will still be decided while lowering the quorum barrier will ensure that proposals that aren’t gaining traction still can be decided in either for or against.\n\n## Conclusion\nIf this proposal is ratified, the quorum threshold percentage would be reduced to 1%. However, this proposal requires a 4% quorum to get ratified.",

One obstruction for underfunded or hobbyist developers is the gas fees op opening a notification channel.\n\n## **Proposal Description**\n\nAllow developers to request a $PUSH airdrop commensurate with the value of the gas fees they paid to create a channel. I suggest doing this on request so that only those that care about the gas cost get reimbursed.\n\nA potential flow:\n\n1. Dev creates a channel\n2. Dev shares Etherscan links to their channel creation in a google form\n3. EPNS team does a monthly accounting to send devs $PUSH relative to the market price\n4. Claiming the reimbursement requires posting the project name, description and live URL to the Discord\n\nPotential abuse-prevention metrics:\n\n1. Time-limit reimbursement applications (e.g. reimbursements must be done within 24h of the channel creation)\n2. Only reimburse 80% of the gas as $PUSH\n3. Only reimburse to the address that created the channel\n\n## Benefits of PIP-06\nThe main goal of EPNS is to integrate with protocols and applications. To that end, removing any barrier to that goal is desirable.\n\nAdditionally, since reimbursements are in $PUSH the developers would immediately have skin in the game regarding EPNS governance.\n\n## ETH Address:\nmentor.eth (0x7dbf6820d32cfbd5d656bf9bff0def229b37cf0e)\n\n-----\nThe EPNS Governance Team will inform the community with the final process after tweaks and adjustments are made to ensure the process is optimal.\nNote: the reimbursement set to 80% will not be subject to modifications.",

Email\nmishrasneha.bb@gmail.com\n\n#### 3. About You\nI am Sneha, a Blockchain Developer and full time builder. Having worked with Blockchain companies like Polygon, Buildspace and Reneverse I have the background knowledge of how the Web3 ecosystem works with ideas to contribute on both the development and business side. I have also been super involved on the community side as part of programmes like ETHWomen, BuildspaceWomen, Phoenix Guild Solidity Mentor and Buildspace India which has allowed me to tap into my network and help make things happen.\n\nEmail: same as above\nTwitter: @sneha_bb\nDiscord: lazy_panda#0274\n\n#### 4. Project TL;DR\nSocial3 is the first-ever Web3 based social hiring platform that incorporates a refer-&-earn model but for talent. With Social3, degens can hop onto the website and refer talent by locking in a fixed amount of tokens to earn a percentage of the recruiting fee on successful conversions. Social3 also maintains your social Proof-of-work by verifying NFTs achieved through different Web3 EdTech based startups such as Buildspace, Questbook, Layer3 and many others. Thus helping recruiters vet through talent with just a click.\n\n#### 5. Proposal Category\nOther: Recruitment\n\n#### 6. Project Overview\n**PROBLEM STATEMENT:**\nThere is a huge talent gap in Web3 that needs to be bridged. Although there are many solutions available, most of them are simple job boards or riddled with multiple inefficacies. Most importantly, since the web3 talent is relatively new, these platforms fail to have a vetting process to evaluate candidates based on their web3 based skills. Apart from this, they fail to leverage one of the essential tools in hiring - referrals. Web3 is notoriously famous to rely on referrals and close on candidates and skip the line.\n\nAlso, Since these platforms are just job boards, the recruiters are left with the hassle of going through a lot of email noise to filter out suitable candidates. The candidates also face the brunt of maintaining multiple applications over email threads and lack a single universal updated profile to showcase to recruiters.\n\n**ABOUT SOCIAL3 IN SHORT:**\n\nSocial3 is the first-ever Web3 based social hiring platform that incorporates a refer-&-earn model but for talent. With Social3, degens can hop onto the website and refer talent by locking in a fixed amount of tokens to earn a percentage of the recruiting fee on successful conversions. Social3 also maintains your social Proof-of-work by verifying NFTs achieved through different Web3 EdTech based startups such as Buildspace, Questbook, Layer3 and many others. Thus helping recruiters vet through talent with just a click.\n\nHere are some key features of our Protocol:\n\nConnections can refer talent by locking in tokens to earn a percentage of the recruiting fee on successful conversions. The recruiting fee is split between the platform, connection and candidate.\nCandidates can build their Web3 “LinkedIn” Profiles by sharing their NFTs and DAO tokens as well as their personal projects to create a promising profile page. This profile is the single updated profile visible across all their applications.\nRecruiters can manage and view profiles of candidates on a dashboard. Personal information to reach the candidate will only be shared with the candidate’s consent. They may also vet and filter out candidates against specific criteria.\nCandidates can learn more about the interviews, salaries and reviews of web3 based companies through our application.\n\n**NEW LIFECYCLE OF HIRING WITH SOCIAL3:**\n\n(i) Candidates/Recruiters/Connectors > (ii) Social3 > (iii) Creates social profile > (iv) Applies/refers for opportunities > (v) Recruiter views profile on a single dashboard > (vi) Recruiter filters out based on chosen criteria and makes an offer > (vii) Candidate and Connector earn crypto on successful conversion.\n\n**Work Delegation:**\nThe current tech team consists of 1 designer, 1 backend devs, 1 frontend dev and 1 smart contract dev.\n\n**Funding Ask and Breakdown:**\nStaff costs - 4000 PUSH\nThe team will comprise of\n\n1 Designer\n1 UI/UX Frontend Developer\n1 Backend Developer\n1 Solidity Developer.\nDevelopment/Platform related costs - 1500 PUSH\n\nWe will be making use of the following development tools.\n\nMoralis API\nAWS services for deployment and data storage\nSmart contract audits (at a later stage)\nMarketing - 1500 PUSH\n\nMarketing costs include :\n\nSocial media management tools\nSEO and website optimisation\nEmail marketing tools\nDesign tool subscription\nOffice/Labspace/Equipment - N.A Incubated under IIIC\n\n#### 7. Value Proposition to EPNS\nWe believe this grant will allow foster a long term relationship between Social3 and EPNS to help out with any of your hiring needs. We will be very interested to onboard you as one of the first protocols on the platform and provide you with the right talent. This also opens doors towards future collaborations such as educational initiatives around EPNS Protocol awareness and AMAs with our headstrong community of web3 professionals. We will also be heavily posting on our social channels (Discord, Twitter etc) spreading awareness of the protocol and any opportunities that shall open up.\n\n#### 8.

I have\nbeen dabbling in the web3 content space for quite a while now and am a firm believer that we are\nall gonna make it “WAGMI”.

Project TL;DR\nChainwhiz is an open-source bounty marketplace on Polygon connecting Web3 protocols and DAOs with builders, contributors, and communities. Using our platform, projects can outsource tasks of all categories(design, development, writing, etc.) as bounties and find contributors to solve the bounties in exchange for crypto payments.\n\nChainwhiz also opens up the stage for everyone to contribute to the validation process. With our solution voting mechanism, all community members can stake and vote on the best solutions submitted to the bounties. This helps projects, especially the ones with limited time and resources discover the best solutions to their bounties much faster using the voting scores (calculated after the solution voting) as a reference.\n\n#### 5. Proposal Category\nTooling\n\n#### 6. Project Overview\nChainwhiz is already up and running on the Polygon mainnet. So far, we have hosted 14+ open source bounties and 12+ active bounty hunters have received rewards in crypto for their contributions. We have recorded 70+ sign-ups in a span of 2 months. The next goal is to improve the communication system throughout our platform with the help of EPNS. Notification plays an integral part in our platform as all segments of users need to be notified of every interaction (new bounties, escrow, etc.) to get the very best out of the platform.\n\nWe will be hosting a bounty on our platform itself to implement the notification service.\n\n#### 7. Value Proposition to EPNS\n   1.  Chainwhiz could be the perfect platform to host EPNS bounties and find contributors for the \n Protocol. All the rewards for these bounties could be paid in the form of $PUSH tokens, making it accessible to a larger set of communities. \n   2. EPNS community members would be able to receive updates about new bounties going live on Chainwhiz.\n    3. Provides a unique use-case of EPNS in the landscape of DAO tooling and bounty marketplace.\n    4. In case, the bounty starts receiving solutions, it will be conveyed to the developers through EPNS\n    5. The bounty winners would be announced through the EPNS notification service.\n\n#### 8. Funding Requested\n11,455 PUSH tokens (~ $6000 & freezing the token amount considering the [closing price](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/epns/historical-data/) on 21 May 2022 )\n\n#### 9. Milestones\n\n1. Hosting a Hackathon Bounty Campaign for 2 weeks to Build the notification service using the Showrunner framework.\n2. Conduct a thorough QA of the Notification service, once build, over the Test network, ideally for 1-2 weeks, before moving to the Mainnet.\n3. We will be organizing a 1hr workshop to explain to the community how one can integrate EPNS into their dapps.\n\nHere is a detailed plan for the Hackathon Bounty Campaign, we will be hosting -\n\nA. We will post 6 bounties on Chainwhiz, itself to implement the EPNS notification service on Chainwhiz.\n\nBounty #1: Notification when a new bounty is posted\nBounty #2: Notification when a new solution is posted\nBounty #3: Notifications during the voting phase\nBounty #4: Notification for Bounty Winner Announcements\nBounty #5: Opt-In feature\nBounty #6: Twitter Thread Bounty about EPNS Notifications on Chainwhiz\n\nB. The 3 Best Implementations for each bounty will be rewarded with PUSH tokens.\n\n#### 10. Wallet Address\n0x9e61deE6CeD9EdB1A0F6b90b6eF9c0bA2fF4799f\n\n#### 11.

This proposal aims to further help grow our ecosystem of investors & traders and to stabilize the $PUSH token market with liquidity.\n\n## **Proposal Description**\n\nMaking sure the liquidity of $PUSH is stable across all exchanges is very important to grow the $PUSH community. A highly volatile and illiquid token could drive away potential users. Hence, we propose to onboard **Jump Crypto** as one of our liquidity providers and to **lend them 3% of $PUSH from our community treasury** which now has ~40 Million $PUSH solely allocated for the growth of the ecosystem.\n\n### **About Jump Crypto**\n\nJump Crypto is the crypto arm within Jump Trading Group, which is one of the largest trading firms in the world. The crypto arm has been operating for the past six years and has become core builders, partners, and traders working towards the next frontier in crypto infrastructure. Jump has supported nascent and mature crypto projects alike, growing their networks and communities through liquidity provision. Recently, Jump was behind the $320M USD ‘patch’ of the Wormhole exploit.\n\nMore on Jump Crypto here: [https://jumpcrypto.com/introducing-jump-crypto/](https://jumpcrypto.com/introducing-jump-crypto/)\n\n### Expanding the Relationship with Jump Crypto\n\nJump are the lead investors in the most recent fundraising round for $PUSH and would like to expand their support for the EPNS project by providing liquidity in the $PUSH token on exchanges. As part of this partnership, Jump will borrow $PUSH tokens as inventory to provide liquidity on existing exchange venues as well as future exchange listings.\n\n### Benefits of onboarding JumpCrypto\n\n- improve the token liquidity on exchanges\n- support listing on additional exchange venues\n\nPost onboarding, the performance of the liquidity provider would be reviewed as per the agreement conditions that would be accepted by both parties internally.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIf this proposal is ratified, a legal agreement would be signed by the two parties.",

      "content": "#### Link to the Proposal Draft on Governance Forum: https://gov.epns.io/t/pgp-proposal-thumbs-up-finance/442\n\n#### 1. Project Name\nThumbs Up Finance\n\n#### 2. Email\nthumbsupfinance.eth@gmail.com\n\n#### 3. About You\nI’ve been blogging for nearly a year and making YouTube videos for about 6 months. I’ve had the opportunity to work with protocols like PoolTogether, Index Coop, Loopring, Harvest Finance, Notional Finance, and more. My style of writing, which can be seen on my blog (linked below), aims to provide a level of detail and clarification I would want to see, but in a style that’s accessible and unpretentious. My YouTube videos feature tutorials and walkthroughs for beginner to intermediate DeFi users. Even though I’m relatively new to videography, the level of polish I’ve been able to achieve by working hard has lead many protocols, DAOs, and companies to reach out to me about content partnerships.\nEmail: thumbsupfinance.eth@gmail.com\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/thumbsupfinance 2\nDiscord: thumbsupfinance#6317\n\n#### 4. Project TL:DR\nExplainer content (blog posts, Twitter threads) about EPNS, protocol integrations, and governance.\n\n#### 5. Proposal Category\n- Marketing\n- Educational\nMy content serves to educate enthusiasts and users, while also promoting the value of the protocol itself. It can be used for cross-promotion/social content, or even internally. For example, my videos about the Data Economy Index were **[featured on their official blog](https://blog.titansofdata.org/tutorials/)**, and my walkthrough for PoolTogether **[was posted in their docs](https://docs.pooltogether.com/how-to/how-to-deposit/how-to-get-usdc-and-deposit)**\n\n\n#### 6. Project Overview\nThis grant proposal is for 5 distinct pieces of content. Each is a blog post, ranging from 500-2000 words depending on the complexity of the subject matter. And each post will include thoughtful twitter content to aid in marketing (either a well composed tweet with links, a thread that summarizes the content, or a thread that compliments the content). Here are the ideas I’d like to cover:\n-  \"What is EPNS (and why should you care)?\" - explainer plus tutorial for getting started\n-  Getting involved in EPNS governance - why + how\n- EPNS now integrates with [well known protocol X] - benefits and how to use\n- EPNS now integrates with [well known protocol Y] - benefits and how to use\n- EPNS now integrates with [well known protocol Z] - benefits and how to use\n\nRegarding costs: I suspect there may be some costs involved with using protocols to demonstrate EPNS, but I haven’t factored them into my request. Content partnerships like what I’m proposing have typically provided around $500-1000 per piece of content, and so I’m basing my proposal on those numbers. I remain open to discussing further, but I believe for the quality of work I do, everyone will feel that my valuation of my work is fair.\n\n#### 7. Value Proposition to EPNS\nEPNS is providing tremendously useful function and yet many people don’t yet know about it. My specialty is in explaining things clearly and in an inviting way. It’s the reason PoolTogether has accepted 3 grant requests from me to make content. And the reason Index Coop chose my content to win multiple Layer3 bounties and then followed up with offers for more content partnerships. Harvest Finance as well. I work hard, I produce high quality content, and I choose who I want to work with based on how much I believe in what they’re doing. And I believe in what EPNS is doing, so I know that everyone involved will be happy with the results.\n\n#### 8. Funding Requested\n2500 $PUSH\nBecause the funding is provided in $PUSH on mainnet, I will need to incur some costs should I choose to exchange any (to cover costs, or reinvest in other content), so rather than $2500 worth, I’ve proposed 2500 $PUSH, which is closer to $3000 at todays value. I am open to discussion on this.\n\n#### 9. Milestones\n“What is EPNS post” to be finished by mid-february OR two weeks after funding\n“EPNS governance post” to be finished by the end of february OR 4-5 weeks after funding\nProtocol integration posts to be completed at a rate of (at least) 1 per month, for three months following funding (i.e. 1 post in February, 1 in March, 1 in April). Depending on my availability and the hype around specific integrations, I may be able to do these in closer proximity to each other. But I prefer to do good work rather than fast work, and I am making other content as well.\n\n#### 10. Wallet Address\nthumbsupfinance.eth\n\n#### 11. Relevant Links & Attachments\nLinks to my blog, YouTube, Twitter, and newsletter can be found here: https://thumbsup.bio.link\n\n#### 12.

Along with the NFT, each recipient also receives 2400 $PUSH tokens.\n\nAs a majority of the Web3 world is at ETH Denver, the largest Web3 #BUIDLathon, we can’t think of a better opportunity to build more excitement and awareness around the EPNS protocol. The goal of EPNS ROCKSTAR Campaign aligns well with this idea. Hence we propose to select the Week #43 ROCKSTAR of EPNS winner along with the attendees of the ETH Denver event.\n\n**HYDRA - The Blimp Airdrop**\n\nDuring **[HYDRA](https://www.hydraevent.com/)**, ETH Denver’s official opening party on February 17, 2022, there will be a blimp circling in the air for 6 hours and airdropping gifts to attendees. The person who gets the blimp card with the ROCKSTAR NFT would be chosen as the winner of our Week #43 $ROCKSTAR of EPNS.

      "title": "PIP-01: Push Grants Program (PGP)",
      "content": "## Background\n\nThis proposal will detail the structure of a grants program to facilitate EPNS and other web3 communities to collaborate in the interest of decentralized notifications. The focus will be on empowering a wider network of developers and other contributors to lend their time and talents toward the advancement and adoption of the EPNS protocol. We would like this program to be driven by EPNS community members and share this proposal for your consideration.\n\nEPNS has a community treasury that amounts to ~40 million $PUSH, or almost $80,000,000 USD (as of 19th Jan 2022 ), which is available to fund growth and community initiatives, part of which we’re proposing to be used to fund this grants program. However, it is currently not easy for the community to allocate from the reserve to fund proposals. Talented individuals wanting to dedicate their time to the advancement of EPNS should be able to do so and feel confident their labor, capital, and energies will be appreciated and compensated. Push Grants hope to lay out a transparent process to connect developers/creators/innovators with the resources needed to go from idea to under development.\n\n## Proposal Description\n\nOur proposal is inspired by successful existing grants groups, specifically [AAVE](https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-aave-community-grants-program/3642) and [PoolTogether](https://gov.pooltogether.com/t/ptip-14-pooltogether-grants-committee/1069). Each has operated for 6 months+ with similar funding to that outlined here.\n\nWe propose to run the **Push Grants Program** over two quarters. We request a total Grants budget of $1,000,000 USD from the community treasury. The grants program will kick off as soon as this proposal is approved on Snapshot.\n\nPush Grants program will run in a decentralized and transparent way through the **community forum proposal process** where the **discussion** will be available to all as well. The grant applicant is required to submit a [proposal on the forum](https://gov.epns.io/c/grants/grants-proposals/19) in the [proposed template](https://github.com/ethereum-push-notification-service/epns-grant/blob/main/proposal-template.md). An application is accepted only when it gets approved on Snapshot.\n\nThe requirements for proposals to advance to a Snapshot vote, and the process thereof will be:\n\n- Proposal lives for at least 7 days on the forum.\n- Proposal post receives 10 likes and 3 comments (in favor) within those 7 days or more.\n- A poll will be added within 3 days by the EPNS governance team (EPNSgov) for/against moving to Snapshot vote.\n- A poll must get at least 10 votes in total and will be moved along with For/Against majority.\n    - **FOR**: Proposal gets advanced to Snapshot within 3 days with voting open for another 7 days.\n    - **AGAINST**: Proposers are notified and encouraged to reapply after digesting feedback received.\n- Once the proposal lands on Snapshot, 4% of circulating $PUSH supply participating with a positive result is the passing bar. (At time of writing, 19th Jan 2022, that’s less than 612k $PUSH)\n\n*⚠️ The total timeline can be as little as 15 days. All the forum requirements can be achieved congruently, with the Snapshot voting window running consecutively afterward. (EPNSgov team should complete the 3-day window in just 1 in most cases.)*\n\nApplications will be reviewed and funded on a rolling basis. The applications approved and funded within each quarter will form a funding round which will be tracked, supported, and documented. Results will be made available to the community at the end of each round, as well as at regular intervals throughout.\n\nThe EPNS governance team (EPNSgov) will be responsible for any further management and support necessary to ensure the proper operation of this initiative. This will be done in a transparent way with feedback received during the program. Including the above-mentioned tracking schedule, these duties can include: grantee payments, communications, milestones tracking, and any other duties the EPNSgov team may identify as necessary. This support will be provided by EPNS in support of this community initiative.\n\nGrant funding will be disbursed based on the milestones laid out in the grant proposal. In general, the goal will be to align long-term incentives with the interests of the EPNS community and PUSH holders.\n\n### Budget\n\n$1,000,000 USD from the community treasury. The budget is to be used strictly for the funding of proposals passed through this grants governance process, and the ongoing maintenance in support of it.\n\nShould there be any potential legal fees associated with the PGP those costs will be covered by the overall program budget. These services would be identified and managed by the EPNSgov team. Another fee incurred by the program will be gas costs. We will swap PUSH to ETH for that purpose at the beginning of every 3-month wave and as needed otherwise. Those will also be covered by the total program budget.\n\nUpon a successful passing vote on Snapshot, the $PUSH funds will be allocated to a dedicated multi-sig address for program funding. This will be a 5 person multi-sig managed by lead members of the EPNS team. They will create and manage the send tx’s to successful proposers’ addresses.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIf this proposal is ratified, Push Grants Program will begin accepting proposals for grants on a rolling basis.",

      "content": "## Background\n\nHealthy governance is one where the community is actively engaged and is contributing to the protocol. This can be done by suggesting improvements, being active on the Discord Channel, tweeting about the project, making PRs, delegating their $PUSH tokens, and also making Governance Proposals.\n\nSince the beginning of EPNS, the community has always been at the center of protocol, and with the launch of governance, it’s an important step towards complete decentralization.\n\nWe propose to incentivize proposers who have their proposal approved on Snapshot.\n\n## Proposal Description\n\nFor EPNS Governance to thrive we need meaningful proposals for the voters to show up and support as well. In an effort to attract and incentivize these kinds of proposals we’re offering an ongoing reward drop to addresses that make it through the proposal, discussion, then voting stage *successfully* (meaning an approved Snapshot vote). However, approved Push Grant proposals are excluded from this incentive program.\n\nThe reward will be **200 $PUSH** paid to the proposing address (an Ethereum wallet). As an added bonus to proposals who gain lots of support, **100 $PUSH** will be given to the user if their vote count is 50% more than the average of the prior four successful $PUSH vote totals on Snapshot (example below). \n\nThe program is meant to be offered on an ongoing basis, until and unless EPNS governance chooses to replace it. No current EPNS Team members are eligible for the incentives. \n\n> ***Added bonus example:** \nA proposal passes on Snapshot (number of individual wallet addresses are not relevant, just the $PUSH voting power).\nAssume the previous 4 passing proposals on Snapshot have **825k**, **1.09m**, **931k**, and **1.12m** $PUSH votes respectively. That’s 991k average + 50% or more would get this user a total of **300 $PUSH!  (rounded to 1,000th here)**\n$(824.31k + 1.09m + 931.12k + 1.12m)/4 * 1.5 = 1.487m PUSH$*\n>",
