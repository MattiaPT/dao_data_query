      "title": "NMDP 8: Establish karpatkey as the Treasury Manager for Nexus Mutual DAO",
      "content": "## Summary\n\nThis proposal outlines a collaboration between karpatkey and Nexus Mutual, focusing on managing the Nexus Mutual DAO Treasury.\n\nUpon approval, karpatkey will assume the role of treasury manager for Nexus Mutual’s DAO treasury. Utilising proven non-custodial solutions, karpatkey will manage the entire treasury’s assets, coordinating all actions with the Nexus Mutual DAO’s investment committee.\n\nThe asset management strategy will involve gradually diversifying out of wNXM and NXM to accumulate ETH, ETH derivatives and stablecoins. The targeted allocation will result in approximately $2M in ETH and ETH derivatives, $1.5M in stablecoins, and $3M in wNXM/NXM, totalling $6.5M under active management.\n\nKarpatkey requests a 0.5% management fee and a 20% performance fee for its services. The management fee will be applied to the net asset value (NAV) of all funds under non-custodial treasury management, while the performance fee will be based on the yield generated by karpatkey’s strategies. The Nexus Mutual DAO will make service provider payments to karpatkey in monthly instalments denominated in NXM or wNXM.\n\nNexus Mutual DAO retains the right to terminate this agreement at any time through its Governance Mechanism.\n\n## Voting Options\n\n* **Option 1**: Approve\n* **Option 2**: Do not approve\n* **Option 3**: Abstain\n\n## Specification\n\n### Services\n\nThe services karpatkey will provide, and their implementation has been previously outlined in the [Request for Comment](https://forum.nexusmutual.io/t/rfc-establish-karpatkey-as-the-treasury-manager-for-nexus-mutual-dao/1499), but are summarised below:\n\n**Asset Management Infrastructure**\n* Deploy non-custodial asset management infrastructure.\n* Implementing automated risk management tools, prioritising the safety of Nexus Mutual DAO funds.\n\n**Treasury Management**\n* Explore treasury diversification to create value and reduce concentration risk.\n  * In particular, diversifying NXM may be an opportunity to improve the DAO risk management and capacity to generate yield. It is important to ensure alignment with the DAO on the amount of NXM to include in the scope, assets, and execution steps. Doing this in tranches will enable the speed to be adjusted to the market price and ratchet mechanism.\n  * Initially, karpatkey suggests diversifying the first tranche into ETH, stablecoins and staked NXM.\n* Allocate treasury funds into DeFi strategies that offer risk-adjusted returns. karpatkey interacts only with renowned and battle-tested DeFi protocols to minimise risks (e.g. technological, market, or governance risks).\n* Provide detailed and regular reports on Nexus Mutual Treasury’s asset allocation and performance.\n\n**DAO-to-DAO Synergies**\n* Explore opportunities to expand Nexus Mutual product adoption through partnerships with other DAOs where possible.\n\n## Implementation and Reporting\n\nActive treasury management will rely on the leading non-custodial asset management infrastructure solution based on Safe, a battle-tested protocol currently holding over $100Bn in assets, and [Roles Modifier](https://docs.roles.gnosisguild.org/). Roles Modifier is a role-based access control technology based on Safe and Zodiac Modules that enables the definition of strict and granular permissions policy. More specifically, Permissions Policies consist of:\n* a set of allowlisted contract addresses;\n* a set of allowlisted functions within these allowlisted contract addresses; and\n* a function-specific set of argument constraints.\n\nBased on Nexus Mutual DAO’s preference, a new Safe will be deployed separately from the existing treasury safe. To ease the implementation, karpatkey will set up the Safe and the initial configuration. The initial deployment will include the Permission Policies reviewed and approved by the Nexus Mutual DAO. Once the Roles Modifier is fully configured and tested, karpatkey will transfer ownership back to Nexus Mutual using the set of signers in the existing treasury, and the Nexus Mutual DAO will fund the Avatar Safe. This will enable karpatkey to allocate treasury funds through the Manager Safe multisig without retaining custody of the funds. After a successful deployment, the commission destination address for the DAO would be updated to the new Avatar Safe address.\n\nContingent to further discussion with the Investment Committee, karpatkey proposes to actively manage approximately $6.5M worth of assets:\n* ETH and ETH Derivatives for $2M;\n* stablecoins for $1.5M; and\n* $3M in wNXM and NXM.\n\nkarpatkey proposes to gradually diversify out of wNXM and NXM to obtain the balances of the ETH, ETH derivatives and stablecoins specified above.\n\nAs detailed above, defining the repository of DeFi strategies will result from an educated joint discussion between Nexus Mutual and karpatkey. As an example, the following is a list of DeFi strategies with potential application to Nexus Mutual DAO treasury:\n* Stake NXM in Nexus Mutual Staking Pools\n* Liquidity provision of wNXM in AMMs to increase market depth\n* Stake ETH on reputable Liquid Staking protocols like Lido, and RocketPool\n* Supply assets to battle-tested lending markets like Aave v3\n* Provide liquidity to Impermanent Loss minimised AMMs, like rETH/ETH or DAI/USDC, in DEXes like Balancer and Curve\n* Stake assets in yield aggregators like Aura and Convex\n* Deposit stablecoins on low-risk native strategies like Maker DSR or Aave stkGHO (Safety Module).\n\n**Monitoring**\n\nThe monitoring and alerts system is designed to enhance risk management and ensure timely responses to potential threats. Alerts are configured for various metrics such as prices, collateral ratios, and liquidity. Emergency plans and automated disassembly functions are implemented to ensure quick response to any threats. In-house developed protection bots (Guardians) enable automated position adjustments in response to specific triggers, including suspected exploits, abnormal pool behaviour, rapidly decreasing collateral ratios, and other predefined risk scenarios.\n\n**Reporting**\n\nAs part of our efforts to maximise transparency and visibility to the DAOs karpatkey collaborates with, Nexus Mutual DAO will have access to a monthly report showing a detailed description of the treasury’s assets and DeFi allocations. Some of the key metrics that will be part of the report are the Net Asset Value (NAV), the value of assets allocated to DeFi positions, and the treasury annualized performance based on the analysed period. Similar reports for other DAOs can be found on karpatkey’s reports site.\n\n## Budget request\n\nThis proposal specifies the entire treasury will be managed by karpatkey non-custodially. The fee structure is explained below:\n* A **0.5% management fee** will be charged in NXM or wNXM and collected in monthly installments. This fee will be 0.5% of the Net Asset Value (NAV), which includes all assets in the [DAO Treasury](https://app.safe.global/balances?safe=eth:0x586b9b2F8010b284A0197f392156f1A7Eb5e86e9) and considers asset prices at the end of the month.\n* A **20% performance fee** of the yield generated over the last month will also be charged in NXM or wNXM on monthly installments.",

      "title": "NMDP 6: Fund, Launch the Nexus Mutual Grants & Accelerator Program",
      "content": "*BraveNewDeFi and Dopeee co-authored this proposal*\n\n## Voting Options\nMembers can select one of the following choices:\n* **For**\n* **Against**\n* **Abstain**\n\n## Overview\n\nCurrently, the Foundation and DAO teams are focused on increasing cover sales by 20x in 2024. To achieve this goal, we need more builders, risk experts, brokers, and underwriters to contribute to the Nexus Mutual ecosystem.\n\nBraveNewDeFi and Dopeee propose that members vote to fund and launch a combined Grants & Accelerator Program with $3m (49,571 NXM at time of publication), which would run for an 18-month period. The program would have clear calls to action to fund one-off projects and emerging risk businesses with the capital they need to build on top of Nexus Mutual. With more teams building within our ecosystem, the Mutual can expand distribution, develop new products, enter new markets, and improve our existing products and interfaces.\n\n## Rationale\n\nThe [Nexus Mutual DAO Treasury](https://app.zerion.io/0x586b9b2f8010b284a0197f392156f1a7eb5e86e9/overview) is well funded, with more than $20.5m available to fund DAO team operations and other community related activities that support the Mutual’s growth, adoption, and awareness. In the past, the Mutual ran a grants program that was reactive in nature, where members waited for people to suggest ideas, submit proposals, and go through the governance process. Because the previous program didn’t provide potential grantees with any potential scope, guidelines, areas where we need others to build, etc., it didn’t result in long-term success.\n\nWith the Nexus Mutual V2 protocol, it’s easier to build on top of the Mutual, launch risk management businesses (i.e., syndicates), develop new products, distribute cover, etc. Now is the right time to launch a Grants & Accelerator Program, where we can provide funding to people who can help us improve discoverability and distribution; expand into new markets and reach new users; and upgrade our existing products and interfaces.\n\nThe program BraveNewDeFi and Dopeee are proposing is proactive, with clear calls to action and RFPs for projects and risk businesses the Mutual needs to expand, grow cover sales/fees, and onboard more experts into our ecosystem. The goal is to provide funding to teams and people who want to build on top of the Mutual and expand our ecosystem in ways we cannot do by ourselves. BraveNewDeFi and Dopeee want the Grants & Accelerator Program to attract talented people with great ideas/expertise who can benefit by building on top of Nexus Mutual and underwrite cover with our Capital Pool.\n\nWith the Mutual's aggressive growth targets for cover sales, the proposed committee would want to move fast, fund great teams, and establish go-to-market strategies that allow the Mutual to start supercharging our cover sales, while ensuring members manage risk exposure. As part of this proposal and in an effort to keep the process agile, BraveNewDeFi and Dopeee want to establish a committee with the power to provide funding for grants and to teams in our accelerator program on a discretionary basis.\n\nThis committee’s core purpose will be to review responses to RFPs, select the best teams, and distribute grant funding effectively and quickly to individuals and teams working to expand distribution, sell cover, and develop new products within our ecosystem.\n\n## Specification\n\nBraveNewDeFi and Dopeee have proposed forming a committee-run grants and accelerator program for an initial 18-month period. They are requesting a maximum budget of $3m in NXM to fund the program, with $1m allocated to funding grants and $2m allocated to funding teams accepted to the Nexus Mutual Accelerator Program.\n\nAt this time, they are not requesting an operating budget, as all proposed committee members are existing contributors to either the Foundation or DAO teams.\n\nThe committee will have the discretion to approve:\n* Individual grants of up to $100k\n  * RFPs will be posted with suggested budgets outlined, with no single RFP representing more than the $100k maximum amount. Most grants will be significantly smaller than the maximum amount.\n  * Teams can also submit grant requests for ideas outside of the suggested RFP board posted on the Nexus Mutual DAO website (WIP).\n  * After a grant request is submitted the committee will review and respond within 14 days. The goal is to move quickly, while ensuring the process is competitive, so the committee provides funding to the team that can provide the most value to the Mutual.\n* Commitments of up to $500k per team upon being accepted to the Accelerator Program.\n  * Teams accepted to the Accelerator Program will make a commitment to work closely with the Foundation and DAO teams for a set amount of time to build their business, develop any new product(s), and establish a go-to-market strategy. Funding will be contingent on these agreements, which will be available on the Nexus Mutual DAO website (WIP).\n\nThis program will have an open submission window, but only 4-6 spots are available. Because the Foundation and DAO teams will be committing time, resources, and funding to those accepted, this will be a more exclusive process, where only the best applicants will be accepted.\n\nIf this proposal is approved, the grants and accelerator committee would provide quarterly updates to members to highlight the teams building within our ecosystem, the granted funded and outstanding RFPs, and gauge impact of the program over time. This program will also have a dedicated section on the Nexus Mutual DAO website, where anyone can read about the program, the grants funded, teams accepted into our accelerator program, outstanding RFPs, areas of interest, etc.\n\n### Committee Members\n\nThey've proposed a committee of five (5) members: one (1) lead and four (4) reviewers. The committee lead will dedicate a significant amount of time to organise the program, conduct outreach to potential builders/risk experts/teams that may be a good fit for the grants/accelerator program, market and create awareness around the program, coordinate with the rest of the committee to review submissions in a timely fashion, etc.\n\nThe proposed reviewers will be as follows:\n* Dopeee | Member of the Business Development team. Proposed Committee Lead.\n* BraveNewDeFi | Head of DAO Community team/Contributor to the Product & Risk team.\n* Roxana Danila | Head of Engineering team.\n* Rei | Head of DAO R&D team\n* Hugh Karp | Founder\n\n### Priorities\n\nThe priority for 2024 is 20x cover growth, and the following grants and accelerator program guidelines will create the foundation for and directly facilitate this level of cover growth.\n\nThe Grants Program will focus on the following priorities for grants:\n* Legal and Regulatory\n* Technical Product Improvements\n* Improving the User Experience\n* Distribution and Marketing\n* Integrations and Composability\n\nThe Accelerator Program will prioritise submissions for teams who are:\n* Building new risk businesses into areas outside of the Mutual’s existing product offerings\n* Developing new cover products with risk frameworks and technical expertise outside of the existing Foundation and DAO teams\n* Bringing an existing distribution network with the business they can build on top of the Mutual\n\n### What will success look like?\n\nThis program will be measured primarily based on growth in cover sales ($ volume and # sold), cover fees, and membership numbers. Other metrics aren’t as easily quantifiable, such as improving existing products, risk controls, and user interfaces, but the end result of such improvements should be growth in these core metrics.\n\nOnce Q4 2024 concludes, the grant and accelerator program can be measured by the Mutual’s overall growth in cover sales and cover fees.\n\n## Technical Specification\n\nSend the 49,571 NXM to the [Nexus Mutual Community Staking Pool multisig](https://app.safe.global/home?safe=eth:0xFA7E852Ceb3F7d0f1AC02F3b8AFCa95e6DcBdb3C).",

      "title": "NMDP 5: Create the Nexus Mutual Community Staking Pool",
      "content": "On behalf of the DAO Teams, BraveNewDeFi is sharing this proposal regarding the 57,607 NXM allocated to **Option 4: Stake it against selected risks in the Nexus Mutual protocol** from the February 2022 NMDP titled [How should we utilize the wNXM purchased during Operation TM-12?](https://snapshot.org/#/community.nexusmutual.eth/proposal/0x9030cdd6ba94ae7b6bac959ff87921d7c34221dd782fb32221fdfb8217115676)\n\n## Voting Options\n\nMembers can select one of the following choices:\n* **For**\n* **Against**\n* **Abstain**\n\n## Summary\n\nTo date, this earmarked NXM has not been allocated to stake against any risks within the Nexus Mutual protocol. As the Foundation and DAO teams work to scale cover sales and increase cover fees earned, the addition of a new staking pool with 57.6k NXM would be a significant advantage.\n\nOn behalf of the DAO teams, BraveNewDeFi is asking members to approve the creation of the Nexus Mutual Community Staking Pool, where the 57,607 NXM can be staked and used to open Protocol Cover and Bundled Protocol Cover capacity. More capacity can help the Mutual achieve our current goal of scaling cover sales\n\n## Specification\n\nMembers have already allocated 57,607 NXM for staking within the Nexus Mutual protocol in a previous NMDP in 2022. BraveNewDeFi has proposed that the [following 2/4 Safe multisig](https://app.safe.global/home?safe=eth:0xFA7E852Ceb3F7d0f1AC02F3b8AFCa95e6DcBdb3C) be used to custody the 57,607 NXM. Once the NXM is in the wallet, the signers can create a new staking pool, which would be managed by the Product & Risk team (Hugh and BraveNewDeFi) to open up capacity for Protocol Cover and Bundled Protocol Cover. The NXM in this multisig would be staked for a one (1) year period and the NXM Staking NFT would be held in the multisig.\n\nThe Safe multisig is setup with the following signers:\n* BraveNewDeFi\n* Hugh Karp\n* Roxana Danila\n* Rei Melb\n\n## Rationale\n\nIn Q1 2024, the Mutual sold $75,112,320 worth of cover and earned $549,723 in cover fees. We’ve seen popular products like Pendle Protocol Cover, Spark Protocol Cover, and the Pendle Bundled Protocol Cover products see significant demand from members, while capacity has been constrained.\n\nThese three (3) products collectively represent 40.40% of all cover sales and 61.58% of fees earned in Q1 2024. If more capacity were available, there’s no doubt the Mutual could sell more cover for in-demand Protocol Cover products such as these and others.\n\nSince Protocol Cover and Bundled Protocol Cover represent 66.67% of all cover sales and 82.34% of all cover fees earned, it would make the most sense to use the 57,607 NXM from the above NMDP to open up additional capacity on Protocol Cover and Bundled Protocol Cover products. For more information on the Mutual’s Q1 2024 cover sales, see the First Quarter (Q1) 2024 Insights Report.\n\nWith additional capacity, more cover can be sold, more cover fees can flow into the Capital Pool, and the DAO Treasury can generate more NXM.\n\n## Technical Specification\n\nSend the 57,607 NXM to the [Nexus Mutual Community Staking Pool multisig](https://app.safe.global/home?safe=eth:0xFA7E852Ceb3F7d0f1AC02F3b8AFCa95e6DcBdb3C).\n\nLaunch and manage a private staking pool with the 57,607 NXM allocated only to Protocol Cover and Bundled Protocol Cover products, as managed by the Product & Risk team.",

      "content": "Following the forum post [Grant to help scale Layer 2 cover purchases via OpenCover](https://forum.nexusmutual.io/t/nmdp-4-grant-to-help-scale-layer-2-cover-purchases-via-opencover/1432) posted on April 20, I, Jeremiah of OpenCover, am requesting a grant of 230 NXM for OpenCover to help scale and continue to grow Nexus Mutual's cover sales on L2s.\n\n## Voting Options\n\nMembers can select one of the following choices:\n* **For**\n* **Against**\n* **Abstain**\n\n## Note\n\n*This Snapshot proposal was posted on behalf ofJeremiah of OpenCover.*\n\n## Summary\n\nOpenCover has been distributing [Nexus Mutual products on Layer 2](https://opencover.com/app/?invite=NexusFam) since September 2023 to help drive onchain cover adoption. So far we have been focused on building, making 30+ Nexus products purchasable directly from Base, Optimism, Arbitrum and Polygon with more chains and products coming soon. Our goal is to make virtually all retail-facing Nexus products available on L2 (this should happen this month), list new products shortly/immediately after they are listed on Nexus (from May) and support 10+ EVM-compatible chains by the end of summer.\n\nAs of 20 April 2024, we’ve sold over 500 covers on L2 totaling $4,158,304 in protection which generated $27,799 in premiums for the mutual with a net increase in sales in the last 3 months. Our model is based on socializing gas costs across users by bundling purchases on L2 into a single aggregate cover on L1 and purchasing L1 cover at off-peak times to further minimize L1 gas costs.\n\nThe model is sustainable at scale but with L1 gas prices significantly increasing in the last couple of months, we would like to ask for a one-off grant to help us scale and continue to grow Nexus cover sales on L2.\n\n## Impact Areas\nIncreased cover purchases, adoption catalyst: Nexus products accessible on Layer 2 at no cost to the mutual (beyond this potential grant).\n\n## Specification\n\n[Historical onchain data](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1IoSThv9a8I6xJDYR2jusZ4HVZIgJlil3Ow4l12PLLNU/edit#gid=0) shows an all-time total cost of 2.99 ETH on L1 to serve 502 covers on L2.\n\nSince January, the cost was 2.31 ETH in L1 gas fees to serve 215 covers on L2 with a bundling factor of ~2.25 (OpenCover was able to deliver an average of ~2.25 covers on L2 per L1 cover). The average collected in premiums by the mutual per L2 cover sale was $123.46 and the growth rate in number of covers sold on L2 is growing at around 10% month-over-month (CAGR since Jan).\n\n## Grant Request\n\nWe would like to ask for a total grant of 230 NXM (~4.7 ETH) to support the next 4 months’ worth of operations broken down into the following: 60 NXM (retrospective commission on cover sales) + 170 NXM (forward-looking L1 gas subsidy).\n\n* 60 NXM corresponds to the commission that’s been directed to the DAO treasury from our L1 cover purchases to date (capturing these directly is on our near-term engineering roadmap but have prioritized user-facing features so far)\n* 170 NXM to support 4 months’ worth of L1 gas expenses to purchase cover from the mutual.\n\n*Ceteris paribus*, given the current monthly growth rate of L2 cover purchases we anticipate this will support at least 190 L1 cover purchases driving at least 425 cover purchases on L2 expected to generate ~52,000$ in premiums in the next 4 months.\n\nIt is understood this would be a one-time request to help us scale offering Nexus covers on L2 sustainably. We do not seek to recover any retrospective development or gas costs.",

It should do so through Enzyme FInance integration for 3.35% of the Capital Pool.\n* **No**: Nexus Mutual should not utilize a portion of the Capital Pool in Morpho-Aave V2/V3.\n* **Abstain**\n\n## About Morpho\nMorpho is a lending protocol, the third biggest on Ethereum after Aave and Compound, with +$700m currently deposited.\n\nMorpho improves the capital efficiency of positions on lending pools such as Aave and Compound by matching lenders and borrowers peer-to-peer, strictly improving APY on both sides. While offering superior rates, Morpho preserves the same user experience, liquidity, and parameters as the underlying lending protocol.\n\n## Proposed allocation strategy in Morpho\nGiven the max allocation rules exposed earlier and the degree of risk incurred by Morpho, an initial deposit of 5% of the 96,960 ETH (i.e. 4.848 ETH or 3.35% of the Total Capital Pool Liquidity) into Morpho-Aave is proposed. \n\nThis amount would be earning improved rewards from lending ETH while leaving substantial room for higher yield/riskier strategies.\n\n## Morpho smart contract risks\n\nMorpho adds extra lines of code compared to a lending pool alone. The top audit firms worldwide performed over 20 audits to limit this additional risk. Morpho Labs team also formally proved part of the protocol in a Yellow-Paper and with the help of Certora.\n\nIn more detail:\n* Morpho is the number 1 out of 300+ projects on [DeFi Safety with a 98% mark](https://defisafety.com/app).\n* [20 audits were made on Morpho contracts](https://docs.morpho.xyz/security/audits) with top-tier auditors like Trail of Bits, Chainsec, Spearbit, etc. Morpho has a recurrent partnership with Spearbit.\n* Parts of Morpho’s code were [formally verified](https://docs.morpho.xyz/security/formal-proving) in Why3 or with Certora’s automatic formal prover\n* Morpho’s logic has been formally described in the [Yellow Paper](https://yellowpaper.morpho.xyz/). The Yellow Paper also proves important properties about the improvement of Morpho compared to underlying lending pools.\n* Morpho has a large $555,555 [Immunefi Bounty](https://immunefi.com/bounty/morpho/) for smart contracts and front end\n\n## Depositing through Enzyme\nMorpho is aware of the relationship Nexus Mutual has with Enzyme Finance, the work done on the custom Chainlink oracle reporting the value in ETH back to the Capital Pool, (necessary to keep accounting the assets for possible claims) and other Enzyme features potentially important to Nexus Mutual. Therefore, depositing into Morpho could be done through a vault managed by Enzyme. The Enzyme <> Nexus Mutual integration is currently being built and audited by Enzyme and will be ready around mid-July of this year.",

      "title": "Signalling Vote: how to proceed with staking on Enzyme vault (first 50% AUM)",
      "content": "SUMMARY \nOver the last few weeks, members have reviewed and discussed a proposal that recommends restarting the Nexus Enzyme vault & diversifying ETH across staking providers. This vote is a non-binding signalling vote, which will be used to gauge members' support for either proposal or if there is demand to seek alternatives to the existing proposal.\n\nRATIONALE\nThe assets on the Nexus vault on Enzyme have been idle for the last few months. At the same time the cost of the Proof of Reserve Chainlink Oracle has been a recurring operating expense that is not being offset by any revenues or yields. With this proposal Avantgarde proposes to put back those assets to work in several phases, starting to generate staking rewards for the Nexus’s Capital Pool, while ensuring that a diversified approach minimises the risks for the Mutual. \n\nSPECIFICATIONS\nThe proposal suggests implementing risk-managed native staking by selecting node operators and monitoring risks. It aims to provide diversification beyond Liquid Staking tokens and emphasises the importance of Enzyme's ability to access a variety of node operators while maintaining consistent Proof of Reserve in ETH. The plan involves allocating 50% of the idle WETH (6,624 WETH) to Kiln initially and waiting for the integration and audit of Stakewise V3. The proposal aligns with the timeline and allows the Mutual's Engineering Team to focus on existing priorities. This Snapshot covers the first part only, i.e. 50% allocation to Kiln.\n\nEXPENSES \nAvantgarde proposes a competitive flat annual fee of 0.3% (inclusive of protocol fee) based on total assets under management, while waiving half of the fees during the interim period in which the AUM is partially deployed. This fee corresponds to around 6% of annual staking rewards at the current APY%.\n\nVOTING OPTIONS\nYou can choose from one of the following options when you cast your vote:\n\nOption A: YES, stake 6,624 WETH through Kiln\nOption B: NO, make no changes.\nOption C: None of the above.

      "title": "Signaling Vote: how to proceed with tokenomics proposals",
      "content": "## Summary\n\nOver the last month, members have reviewed and discussed two proposals that recommend changes to Nexus Mutual's bonding curve and tokenomics.\n\nThis vote is a non-binding signaling vote, which will be used to gauge members' support for either proposal or if there is demand to seek alternative proposals to the two existing tokenomics proposals.\n\n## Rationale\n\nFor the last two years, members have not been able to redeem NXM for ETH since the minimum capital requirement ratio has been below 100%. This has prevented the mutual from attracting more underwriting capital since members can buy wNXM below the bonding curve price for NXM.\n\nThe two proposals put forth potential solutions that would allow for members to redeem NXM for ETH, close the price difference between the market price of wNXM and the book value of NXM, and allow the mutual to attract underwriting capital to drive growth.\n\n## Specification\n\nTo date, members have posted two different tokenomics proposals that each provide a different solution to the current redemption lock.\n\n[Ratcheting AMM design](https://forum.nexusmutual.io/t/tokenomics-proposal-replacing-the-bonding-curve/988/1). Posted by Rei of the tokenomics working group. The proposal's TL;DR written by Rei:\n> When NXM is minted from the protocol by contributing ETH, the system price goes up; when NXM is redeemed, the price goes down. This is achieved via an internal automated-market-maker pool similar to Uniswap v2, with the mutual itself as the only liquidity provider. The mutual will continue to provide liquidity to the pool subject to assets exceeding the MCR. The MCR floor is removed and MCR is driven by Cover Amount. Minting NXM from the protocol is disabled below asset-value-per-NXM (\"book value\") and redemptions are disabled above book value. A ‘ratchet’ mechanism moves the protocol NXM price towards book value over time instead.\n\n[Modifying the existing bonding curve design](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qjGKlb9C4gpI23O0RKv-TIF-LPb6jvROi2eAdmOT-P4/edit?usp=sharing). Posted by community member ReeseWickham. The proposal's TL;DR written by Reese:\n> This proposal supports the idea that the optimal solution for Nexus Mutual’s tokenomics is the existing model, based on a bonding curve, as described in the white paper. The reason why redemptions have been disabled and other undesirable effects happened, can be traced back to a single parameter defining the minimum capital requirements. Removing this parameter would not impact mutual’s solvency or operations, it would solve redemption issues and it would make the mutual much more capital efficient and profitable. This proposal also explains how this change is technically feasible and easy to implement.\n\n### Technical specifications\n\nThe next stage is dependent on the outcome of this signaling vote. If **Option A** or **Option B** receive the majority vote, then the next stages will involve:\n\n**Technical development**. The Engineering team would develop the smart contracts necessary to implement the chosen proposal. This would include development, testing, and audits of the design. \n\n**Determine parameters of the chosen design**. Members will discuss and select the initial parameters for the chosen design and approve the implementation through an on-chain vote for the final protocol improvement proposal.\n\n## Voting options\n\nYou can choose from one of the following options when you cast your vote:\n* **Option A**: Ratcheting AMM design\n* **Option B**: Modifying the existing bonding curve design\n* **Option C**: Make no changes\n* **Option D**: None of the above.

      "content": "139k $SAFE tokens to be airdropped to the community funds multisig. Half of those will be unvesting on transferability launch, and the other half will be unvesting over 4 years.\n\nIts important that the community fund executes the claim until 27.12.22 10:00 CET (delegating to nexusmutant.eth if his gov proposal passes) or the allocation will be transferred back to the SafeDAO treasury.\n\nGiven Nexus has strong growth goals, and $wnxm is undervalued selling below book value i’d propose that the community fund sells all $safe tokens as they unlock. To avoid timing the price, i’d propose to do so in two stages.\n—\n\nIf $safe is worth above 0.7$ i’d propose to sell 50% in exchange for $wnxm\n\nIf $safe is worth above 1$ i’d propose to sell the other 50% in exchange for $wnxm\n\nThis could be extremely easily executed via gasless limit orders between the two pairs, but might be more advantageous via cowswap.\n\nAt 1bn fully diluted safe tokens, its easy to calculate the mcap → eg. $1 per safe is $1bn safe fully diluted mcap\n\nWhat to others think? Just wanted to start this conversation\n\nAs a side comment opinion: Huge fan of $safe and want nexus to be as supportive as possible, while also knowing that most airdrops are getting dumped heavily on the months following launch (as can be observed with most), and that $wnxm is still almost 50% below book value and thus provides more value for the mutual to be bought back.",

      "content": "The BootNode team has requested a grant of 50,000 USDC and 1,450 wNXM to begin the next phase of the covered vaults project.\n\nThe next phase involves is the development of the design for an ERC-4626 compliant vault that takes an existing ERC-4626 compliant vault (e.g. Yearn) and purchases Nexus Mutual coverage on behalf of all users, with coverage effectively being paid from the yield. A bundled yield-bearing plus covered vault.\n\n## Project Description\n\nTo minimize technical implementation risks for this project, BootNode has proposed a step-by-step delivery approach including the following stages.\n\nThe current proposal will focus only on Phase 2 and Phase 3: Development and testing of the complete smart-contract solution. \n\n**Phase 1: Scope definition & project planning | Complete**\nPhase 2: Iterative development\nPhase 3: User acceptance & transition\n\n## Motivation\n\n1. Purchasing and managing coverage on an ongoing basis can be cumbersome due to the need to roll-over and/or change coverage amounts.\n2. Gas for cover purchases effectively means it’s not economically viable for smaller users.\n3. Bundled products have much higher take-up rates due to the reduced user friction.\n\n## Goals\n* Implement the designed solution.\n* Write documentation.\n* Test the solution.\n*Collaborate with Nexus Mutual on deployment tasks.\n\n## Deliverables\n\n1. Open Source repository with all the code, scripts and documentation needed for deployment and configuration of new Nexus Covered Vaults.\n2. Test code.\n\n## Timeline\nThe estimated timeline for this project would be 8 and 11 weeks of work.\n\n## Grant Request\nThe grant for this phase would be paid in two installments:\n\n* 25,000 USDC as soon as the proposal is approved\n* 25,000 USDC once the deliverables are presented for review\n* 1,450 wNXM to be paid once the deliverables are presented for review\n\nMembers can review the full text of the proposal on the forum: https://forum.nexusmutual.io/t/nexus-covered-vaults-development-phase/926/1\n",

      "content": "\nFor the last several weeks, members have evaluated strategies to capture value from the ETH PoW holdings the mutual will have if a PoW hard fork occurs after the merge happens in September. \n\nTo summarize, the merge on Ethereum will transition the network to Proof-of-Stake. Some stakeholders intend to fork the network to maintain one (or more) Proof-of-work chain(s).\n\nWhen this happens, the mutual's assets will be duplicated on these other chains. The community has already signaled support to sell these assets and bring them back on the PoS chain. The question that remains is how those funds will be used once the ETH PoW assets are sold.\n\nMembers have discussed potential options and there are two clear choices outlined on the Nexus Mutual community forum: \n\n* **Option A**: Use 50% of the proceeds to buy DAI and 50% of the proceeds to buy wNXM. Send DAI to the Capital Pool and wNXM to the Nexus Treasury.\n\n* **Option B**: Use 100% of the proceeds to buy wNXM. Send wNXM to the Nexus Treasury.\n\nMembers can review the previous Snapshot signaling vote and the  full text of the proposals on the forum:\n* ETHPoW Execution, Allocation Discussion | Next Steps: https://forum.nexusmutual.io/t/ethpow-execution-allocation-discussion-next-steps/906\n* Should we grant a 3rd party the ability to sell our PoW ETH on a CEX post-merge?

      "title": "Should we give BootNode a grant to design an ERC-4626 compliant covered vault?",
      "content": "The BootNode team has requested a grant of 32,000 USDC to design an ERC-4626 compliant vault that takes an existing ERC-4626 compliant vault (e.g. Yearn) and purchases Nexus Mutual coverage on behalf of all users, with coverage effectively being paid from the yield. A bundled yield-bearing plus covered vault.\n\n**Project Description**\n\nTo minimize technical implementation risks for this project, BootNode has proposed a step-by-step delivery approach including the following stages.\n\nThe current proposal will focus only on Phase 1 (Discovery & Planning). Development and testing of the complete solution will be a separate proposal, and its budget and duration will be determined at the end of phase 1.\n\nPhase 1: Scope definition & project planning\nPhase 2: Iterative development\nPhase 3: User acceptance & transition\n\n**Motivation**\n1. Purchasing and managing coverage on an ongoing basis can be cumbersome due to the need to roll over and/or change coverage amounts.\n2. Gas for cover purchases effectively means it’s not economically viable for smaller users.\n3. Bundled products have much higher take-up rates due to the reduced user friction.\n\n**Deliverables**\n1. Product Definition Document covering business, functional and technical requirements.\n2. Action plan: technology validation, recommendations on roadmap, milestones, scope, and effort estimates.\n3. BootNode engagement proposal to create a synergetic incentive alignment mechanism (stables and tokens considerations. Goals and KPIs).\n4. If required and time allows, we can also create a prototype.\n\n**Timeline**\nThe estimated timeline for this project would be 5 weeks of analysis, design, and prototyping. If this discovery phase is successful, it should be followed by a second phase for development (not included in this proposal).\n\nThe grant would be paid in two instalments:\n* 16,000 USDC as soon as the proposal is approved\n* 16,000 USDC once the deliverables are presented for review\n\nMembers can review the full text of the proposal on the forum: https://forum.nexusmutual.io/t/proposal-nexus-covered-vaults-discovery-phase/875/1\n",

      "title": "Should We Reimburse Risk Assessors for Undue Loss From Claim 113?",
      "content": "Robert M.C. Forster of Ease (formerly, ArmorFi) posted a proposal on the forum to seek reimbursement for Risk Assessors who had NXM burned to facilitate Claim 113: a 5,000,000 DAI claim payout. The member who filed Claim 113 provided proof of loss that demonstrated a $1.4m loss, but due to the technical limitations present in Nexus V1, partial payments cannot be made, so the full covered amount was paid out to the member who filed Claim 113.\n\nRobert’s proposal seeks reimbursement for 43,940 wNXM to compensate Risk Assessors affected by this claim payout. There has been discussion on how the Protocol Cover wording (https://nexusmutual.io/pages/ProtocolCoverv1.0.pdf) can be interpreted and if there was the expectation that a partial claim could be made.\n\nAfter discussion on the forum, the following options were proposed and will be subject to a Snapshot vote:\n\n* Option A: Reimburse affected Risk Assessors 43,490 wNXM\n* Option B: Reimburse affected Risk Assessors 22,000 wNXM\n* Option C: Do not reimburse Risk Assessors\n\nThis proposal has been discussed at length on the forum, and members can refer to the two forum posts for more information when deciding their vote:\n1.

      "title": "Should the mutual withdraw our Nexus Treasury deposit of wNXM from Bancor v3?",
      "content": "The Nexus Treasury (formerly, the Community Fund) currently has 51,523 bwNXM (50k wNXM originally deposited) deposited in Bancor V3 (recently migrated from 2.1), which was originally approved by the community to provide greater liquidity and earn a return on idle governance tokens. In the past month, Bancor has turned off its Impermanent Loss (IL) protection and Liquidity Mining (LM) rewards, passing on significant losses to users. As a result, we anticipate that we’ll take a 40-50% haircut on the capital deposited.\n\nThis proposal, written by the investment team and community fund members, proposes to withdraw the funds from Bancor v3 immediately, and absorb the 40-50% predicted value loss. We don’t believe that any significant recovery will happen within the next few years, due to declining fees and the size of the (growing) deficit. Meanwhile, we’re still carrying the smart contract risk of having the funds deployed there, as well as the opportunity cost.\n\nGiven that our community fund is almost entirely in NXM and wNXM, the market decline has significantly reduced our runway. By our count, and depending on current market price, we have between $1.5-2m worth of capital in the community fund that is not already allocated for other activities. Based on the projected spend this gives us 24-36 months of runway, which is far less than we would like to see. Therefore, redeeming the capital in Bancor to add to these funds makes a material difference. Unless we anticipate that within the next 24-36 months Bancor will be able to significantly reduce the deficit, the prudent course of action is to cut our losses.\n\nAfter discussion on the forum, the following options were proposed and will be subject to a Snapshot vote:\n* Option A: Withdraw the 51,523 bwNXM deposited in Bancor V3\n* Option B: Do not withdraw the 51,523 bwNXM deposited in Bancor V3\n\nMembers can read the full proposal on the forum: Withdraw the Community Fund capital from Bancor [https://forum.nexusmutual.io/t/withdraw-the-community-fund-capital-from-bancor/876]",

      "content": "This proposal seeks a renewal of the [Immunefi](https://immunefi.com/) Matching Bug Bounty Program with the following requirements and terms:\n\n1. Projects with an active bug bounty program on Immunefi.\n\n2. Provide matching for bug bounties with a critical threat level rating.\n\n3. Cap maximum total payouts at $600k but allow matching up to $600k for projects with greater than $8m in active cover; for projects with active cover between $2m and $8m, the matching bounty will be capped at $200k per bounty payout.\n\n4. Matching ratio will adjust from $1 in matching for every $1 offered as a critical bug bounty (1:1) to $0.50 in matching for every $1 offered as a critical bug bounty (0.5:1)–would create a greater incentive for projects to increase the size of their critical bounty payouts, so long as there is demand for cover on Nexus Mutual.\n\nMatching bug bounty payouts deliver cost effective value to members when the matching payout is less than potential claim payouts on a certain percentage of a project’s active cover amount.\n\nNot all loss events lead to a 100% claim rate. While data on past claim events is thin, members can assume a matching bug bounty is most cost effective when estimated as a percentage of 10% to 40% of the active cover amount for a project.\n\nProposed matching terms are as follows:\n* Cap maximum payouts at $200k (or the remaining funding) for projects with active coverage in the $2m to $8m range; and\n* Cap maximum payouts at $600k (or the remaining funding) for projects with greater than $8m in active coverage\n\n**Members will be able to select one of the following options for this proposal:**\n\n* **Option A**: Renew the program; allocate $600k in total payouts; 0.5-to-1 matching payouts up to $600k for projects with active cover >$8m; 0.5-to-1 matching bounty payout up to $200k for projects with active cover between $2m to $8m.\n* **Option B**: Renew the program; allocate $600k in total payouts; 1-to-1 matching payouts up to $200k for projects with active cover >$2m\n* **Option C**: Do not renew the program; deny request for further funding\n\nMembers can read the full proposal on the forum: [Immunefi Matching Bug Bounty Proposal](https://forum.nexusmutual.io/t/immunefi-matching-bug-bounty-proposal/812/1)",

      "title": "Should we allocate up to 70,000 wNXM from the Community Fund to the wNXM Bancor pool?",
      "content": "Bancor's Tiago Silva created a proposal to allocate up to 70,000 wNXM from the Community Fund and deposit wNXM into Bancor's single-sided wNXM pool. This would allow wNXM from the Community Fund to earn yield and deepen liquidity for wNXM in DeFi.\n\nThe TL;DR of this proposal, as quoted from the forum:\n* Proposal seeking to allocate up to 70,000 wNXM from the Community Fund to the wNXM Bancor pool, assuming space is opened up in the pool. There is a proposal on the Bancor governance to increase the space to 10M BNT (~$25m of space for wNXM to be staked) gradually, 1M increment at a time.\n* Yields have been in the range of 2 - 15% over the last 2 weeks. Data on Liquidity Share, Turnover, and Trade Volume is presented.\n* Full impermanent loss protection provides a safe way for the Community Fund to earn additional yield on some of its idle assets.\n* Bancor’s contract safety, single-sided staking and some upcoming Bancor 3 phase 1 features are especially interesting for a fund deposit.\n\nThis proposal is a companion to one that has already passed through Bancor's Snapshot governance. \n\nThe Bancor community has approved a vote that will increase the trading liquidity limit (TLL) in the wNXM pool from 2M BNT to 10M BNT with 1M increments happening each time the pool space is filled.

      "title": "Should we give BootNode a grant to build MEV protected swaps for the mutual?",
      "content": "The BootNode team has requested a grant of 16,800 USDC and 2,300 wNXM to build an alternative/replacement for the current ETH / Token swap mechanism currently used in Nexus Mutual that will enable swapping arbitrary ERC20 pairs using Gnosis Protocol (CowSwap) to avoid sandwich attacks and other forms of MEV.\n\nThe estimated timeline for this project would be 7 weeks of development and testing, with a gap period during the audit of the smart contracts.\n\nThe grant would be paid in two instalments:\n* 8,400 USDC as soon as the proposal is approved\n* 8,400 USDC and 2,300 wNXM once the code is delivered for review\n\n**Motivation**\n1. If the protocol needs to make a relatively large claim payment/s in DAI then material amounts of ETH need to be swapped for DAI, at the moment the protocol would conduct this via Uniswap V2 only which doesn’t make use of the wider DEX liquidity.\n2. If the protocol wishes to swap assets for investments purposes, e.g. to sell stETH, then the same issues arise with the main difference being the time-sensitivity is likely much less than obtaining funds for claim payments.\n3. Existing asset swaps are quite highly exposed to MEV, in particular, sandwich attacks.\n\n**Project Description**\n\nThe new implementation maintains the same security guarantees from the current design:\n* transactions can only be initiated from whitelisted accounts,\n* trades are only allowed in the correct price range using an onchain twap oracle,\n* and within certain thresholds previously established through governance.\n\nThe new solution could co-exist with the current Uniswap implementation, incrementing the total liquidity that is available for swaps.\n\nScope assumptions and constraints:\n\n* To reduce risk and scope, no changes will be made to the oracles that are currently in use by Nexus, this means the new implementation will not support new assets. The smart contract changes will focus on the CowSwapOperator and the required changes on the Pool contract to make it work.\n* To facilitate and make possible the correct accounting of assets, token allowances, and flow of assets between the pool and the swap operator contract, this implementation will support 1 swap operation at a time. This swap operation could be canceled and replaced by new ones if desired.\n* Both full and partial orders will be supported.\n* The implementation will target version 2 of Nexus smart contracts and will not be ported back to v1.\n\nMembers can review the full text of the proposal on the forum: https://forum.nexusmutual.io/t/proposal-mev-protected-swaps/781",

      "title": "Should we pay 10 ETH from the Community Fund to compensate the affected member who submitted Claim 102?",
      "content": "After the CREAM V1 exploit, a total of five claims were filed with Nexus Mutual. Of the five, four were approved for a pay out because they met the qualifications for a successful claim payout. The member who filed Claim 102 did experience a genuine loss of funds after the CREAM V1 exploit occurred; however, the cover amount for Claim 102 is 500 ETH and the loss of funds totaled ~10 ETH. With Protocol Cover, there is a 20% or greater loss required listed under the “Material” entry in the [cover wording](https://nexusmutual.io/pages/ProtocolCoverv1.0.pdf).\n\nAt this time, Nexus Mutual is unable to pay partial claims. When claims are decided, it is a “yes” or “no” choice, so approving this claim would mean paying out 500 ETH for a ~10 ETH loss. A “no” vote would mean denying the claim and not providing a pay out. \n\nThe Nexus V2 updates will allow for partial claims to be paid when a loss of funds occurs. These updates are the main focus of the development team, and the functionality to pay partial claims will be available in the near future. \n\nAs Claims Assessors, members of the mutual have the power to exercise discretion.\n\nThe Nexus Mutant community has discussed paying the affected member for their loss of funds using assets from the Community Fund (i.e., the treasury). This would **not** result in CREAM V1 Risk Assessors having their staked NXM burned. It would require the mutual to sell Community Fund assets to acquire 10 ETH to facilitate this claim pay out. \n\nMembers who receive a claim pay out have already agreed to give the rights to any future compensation from the CREAM V1 team to the mutual, so if repayment does occur, those funds would be held in the Community Fund.\n\nUltimately, the decision to compensate this affected user for their loss of funds using assets from the Community Fund must be decided by members of the mutual. \n\nYou can review the details of [Claim 102](https://app.nexusmutual.io/claim-assessment/view-claim?claimId=102) to inform your decision. You can review the discussion about Claim 102 in the [Claims Discussion channel in Discord](https://discordapp.com/channels/496296560624140298/689385874265342056/904819854031323216).\n\nShould the Nexus Mutant community compensate the affected member who filed Claim 102 for their loss using assets from the Community Fund (i.e., treasury)?",

      "content": "Steve Larsen, CPA, CFP®, and Adam Blumberg, CFP®, from PlannerDAO applied for a grant for 1000 NXM to fund the legal work required to create the Financial Advisor DeFi Toolkit. \n\nPlannerDAO is building an all-encompassing framework and toolkit which will enable financial advisors to offer Decentralized Finance advice and guidance to their clients in a compliant and safe manner. The toolkit will include:\n\n* Education requirements for DeFi, and for the tech stack PlannerDAO chooses\n* Compliance and regulatory documentation for the advisor to file with the regulators, and have prepared in the event of an audit.\n* Sample agreements to use with clients\n* Tech stack including social recovery wallet, accepted protocols, smart contract cover\n* Error and Omissions insurance covering the DeFi advice and funds\n\nEvery client of an advisor utilizing the toolkit would have to purchase Nexus Mutual smart contract cover for the wallet, and for any protocols being utilized. PlannerDAO would, therefore, be adding distribution and education, and setting up for the possibility of adding commissions and brokerage.\n\nIn addition, PlannerDAO would look to add Nexus Mutual as somewhat of re-insurance, and as a protocol for our Errors and Omissions coverage.\n\nOverall, while Steve and Adam realize this isn’t the typical project seeking treasury funds, PlannerDAO is looking to build a long-term partnership that will onboard so many financial advisors and investors into DeFi with the requirement to use Nexus Mutual smart contract cover.\n\nSteve and Adam have proposed a 90-day timeline for completion. The grant would be paid out in three (3) installments.\n\nThe first installment of 250 NXM will be to get the attorneys started on their work of legal opinion on allowable custodial solutions and investment options. PlannerDAO will require some of the attorneys’ initial thoughts to work through tech stack, insurance and education, and the attorneys require a retainer to start work.\n\nUpon completion of the technology stack and protocol outline, based on the attorney recommendations and opinions, PlannerDAO will submit to Nexus Mutual, and request installment 2 of 350 NXM. This installment will again be for attorneys to draft recommended language to amend SEC and State disclosures and client agreements. At this time PlannerDAO can also start on Errors & Omissions insurance design.\n\nUpon completion of the entire project, PlannerDAO will submit to Nexus Mutual, and request the remaining balance of 400 NXM.\n\n[Forum Post: Financial Advisor DeFi Toolkit](https://forum.nexusmutual.io/t/financial-advisor-defi-toolkit/622)",

      "content": "This is a proposal to move forward with the Nexus Mutual community <> Hats collaboration, the second step after the passing of consideration of collaboration 3 proposal.\nhttps://snapshot.org/#/community.nexusmutual.eth/proposal/QmaJTF5hP1VKJkoK6SJF3v7sCNQJ7N6Gg9HN1XFCfXdYri\n\nHats believe that their solution is a direct continuation of the Bug bounty services discussed and proposed by @BravenewDefi back in February.\nhttps://forum.nexusmutual.io/t/creating-a-bug-bounty-service-run-by-nexus-mutual/433\n\nThe Proposal:\n\nNexus mutual community sets up a committee and deposits NXM into the Nexus Mutual Vault in Hats.\n\nSet up a committee on Hats vault - Choose trusted members of the dev team that could triage the vulnerabilities that will be sent by the hackers / auditors through the encrypted offline communication channel. This team will have visibility to vulnerabilities of the protocol and should be chosen carefully by the mutual. Availability of that team should also be taken into account as vulnerabilities that will be reported will have to be triaged in a timely manner.\n\nDeposit of 6250 NXM (roughly $500,000). We believe this is a sufficient sum to attract developers, auditors, and hackers to re the NXM smart contracts\n*Bear in mind that this is not a grant, but a deposit that incentivizes responsible disclosure of vulnerabilities in the Nexus Mutual contracts and products. At any point the Nexus Mutual community / governance can decide to withdraw the NXM from the vault.\n\nNexus mutual covered protocol 25% reward boost - Nexus mutual will reward hackers/auditors of other vaults on hats that are covered by the mutual with 25% of the reward value that will be given to the hacker in NXM tokens that would not exceed $250k in value per approved disclosure. No deposit is made by the mutual upfront. The mutual will agree to do it and will consider each case on its own. Hats will display this reward boost by the mutual on its UI with a comment (“NXM will consider the boost on a per vulnerability disclosure basis and might not choose to boost every or any vulnerability”).\nHats will boost the NXM vault with an additional 25% emission rate over other protocol vaults on hats.\n\nOnce Hats PPM (Protocol Protection Mining) program is live, the NXM governance will also automatically farm Hats tokens in return for protecting the NXM protocol. This provides additional upside to nexus mutual and it’s community members who participate in the protection mining.\n\nFuture angles of collaboration\n\nAdditional rewards to nexus mutual participants on Hats PPM (Protocol Protection Mining) in the form of NXM tokens. ~3,000 NXM tokens over the course of three months.\nAutomatic buying of nexus mutual insurance from, and for Hat vaults for\nHats finance will prioritize the onboarding of protocols that are covered by the mutual.\n\nHats audit and security measures:\n\nHats contracts has been audited by Zokyo and two individual auditors with no major findings while all the issues were fixed to the satisfaction of the auditors. The funds in the vault and their allocation to hackers/auditors is controlled by the Nexus Mutual committee alone.",

With weekly summits, always on hacking, and the best of the best in the industry joining us you’ll be among friends and passionate colleagues excited to build the Future of Finance.\n\nThe plan is for Nexus Mutual to provide sponsorship at the ’pillar level’ which will give us access to their developer community, submission of build projects ideas that can benefit our protocol, and brand exposure.\n\nOur estimated budget using community funds for our participation is $28k. This budget figure is derived from sponsorship fees, prize pool, and incidental funds to support the team’s presence at HackMoney including “producing” a 45s intro to Nexus Mutual video.\n\nUltimately, we believe that the return on investment is worthy for the continued growth of the mutual, to expand our community, as well as to attract new developers to get involved with building on top of Nexus.\n\nIn order to make the deadline for our participation, we will have to shorten our time horizon for forum post and snapshot vote down to 3 days respectively.\n\nForum Post:  https://forum.nexusmutual.io/t/nexus-mutual-sponsorship-eth-global-s-hack-money-hackathon/547",

      "content": "I’ve been thinking about official Nexus NFTs and how to implement them. Here is what I think could be really cool to gamify the experience, engage members and attract new ones : Each action in the mutual would be rewarded by a different NFT. Low-tier; becoming a member, Mid-tier; buying coverage, staking/risk assessment,  claim assessment and participating in shield mining.  Top-tier would be a elite NFT that would be unlocked once a member has all previous NFTs.  The original proposal has been amended in projected costs to account for artist commission, minting, gas and project management fees of $42,000 USD.\n\nForum Post: https://forum.nexusmutual.io/t/official-nexus-mutual-nfts-proposal/521",

Subsequently, we can analyze the contracts and display warnings of vulnerabilities (or proto-vulnerabilities, i.e., components that when put together can make a service vulnerable). The static warnings will be combined with queries on environmental conditions (e.g., approvals and balances in past transactions, state of initialization of a contract, storage contents) to produce reports that can point to security issues. We will also maintain a contact database for each covered protocol. If a vulnerability is detected in a live system, we will contact the appropriate project team.  We budget the overall project cost at a baseline of $20K/mo (in NXM),  The budgeting also anticipates bonus NXM to be paid if a vulnerability is detected that would have led to a claim payout.\n\nForum post:  https://forum.nexusmutual.io/t/dedaub-nexus-mutual-collaboration-proposal/522",
