The staking programme will run for a period of 2 years.\n\nWe believe this proposal sets forward a fair distribution where TEMP holders, Tempus SAFT investors, and the team receive NOS tokens on the same economic basis.\n\nMore details (including on timing and next steps) can be found in the below thread on the Tempus governance forum.\n\nhttps://forum.tempus.finance/t/proposal-rewarding-temp-holders-following-the-launch-of-nostra/170",

This leaves sufficient room for other TEMP holders to also deposit into the pool if they wish.\n\nWhy?\n\n- It reduces slippage on Bancor, and makes TEMP more tradable due to lower slippage.\n- TEMP is sitting idle in the Treasury, and this is a great way to put idle TEMP to “work”.\n- Due to the core value proposition of Bancor, the deposited TEMP is protected from impermanent loss - the Treasury is guaranteed to make trading fees.\n- It does not increase circulating supply as TEMP will be held by the Treasury (Treasury held tokens are excluded from the circulating supply, regardless of whether they are staked or used to provide liquidity).\n- It increases the long term cooperation between Bancor and Tempus.\n\nOf course, execution of this proposal is also subject to the passing of the Bancor proposal - more details here: https://gov.bancor.network/t/proposal-increase-temp-trading-liquidity-to-500k-bnt-from-100k-bnt/3442.",

      "title": "Who should be elected to form the initial Tempus Grants Committee?",
      "content": "Last week, TEMP tokenholders passed a proposal to establish a Tempus Grants Committee, which will be responsible for providing an ecosystem fund (https://vote.tempus.finance/#/proposal/0x65d8ed0238fdd9e46134f148be955ed0ef4228bba91746a269cd47e16b818d6c). \n\nAs mentioned in the initial proposal (https://forum.tempus.finance/t/proposal-establish-a-tempus-grants-committee/121), it is envisaged that the Tempus Grants Committee will be made up of three individuals from the Tempus Labs team (Pujeet - BD Manager, Richard - Product Manager, and Cristiano - Quantitative Analyst), plus external members of the community.  I would propose that this be limited to two individuals, bringing the Committee to a total of five members.  This figure will ensure a variety of views and expertise are brought to the table while avoiding the administrative complexities that may result from having a larger number of members. \n\nUltimately, it is the choice of TEMP tokenholders who is elected.  Please cast your vote below for which applicants you would like to see form the initial makeup of the Tempus Grants Committee. The top five applicants (in terms of number of votes cast for them) will be selected.  You may spread your voting power across any number of candidates.  Please note that by voting for the Tempus Labs team, you are voting for three individuals.  Assuming the Tempus Labs team is elected, the two top external candidates will fill the remaining two spots on the Committee.\n\nThe Committee will be re-elected every 12 months, subject to a further governance proposal on who should form part of it.\n\nMore details about the candidates can be found in the initial proposal (linked above).\n",

      "title": "Migrate DEX liquidity from Ethereum to Fantom ",
      "content": "In this proposal, I suggest migrating approximately $2m of the current liquidity deployed in Uniswap on Ethereum onto SpookySwap on Fantom.\n\n## Motivation\nSpookySwap is currently the largest DEX on Fantom with $1.2bn TVL (source: Defi Llama) with approximately $250m 24 hr trading volume on average (source: Coin Gecko).\n\nTo foster healthy growth and traction within the Fantom ecosystem as we launch and develop the products, we believe having a tradable $TEMP token on Fantom is key to enabling Fantom users to join the Tempus community. Lastly, by doing this, we also expect a net increase in $TEMP trading volume, which is generally a key criterion for CEX listings.\n\n## Proposal\nThe $TEMP token is currently one of the most liquid tokens for the market cap on Ethereum, with approximately $8.8m of TVL between the Balancer and Uniswap liquidity pools. This allows $TEMP tokens to be traded at large sizes with minimal slippage. We believe migrating the $2m liquidity from the Uniswap USDC/TEMP pool 1 to a new TEMP/WFTM pool on SpookySwap will provide sufficient liquidity for larger trades to be executed on Ethereum with minimal slippage and at the same time allow Tempus to captivate some of the vibrant Fantom community to join Tempus.\n\n## Next steps\n1. If this proposal is voted yes, we will proceed with withdrawing from the USDC/TEMP Ethereum pool and bridging across (using Multichain) the assets\n2. Convert USDC to WFTM\n3. Wait for TEMP to be whitelisted with Multichain and SpookySwap (underway)\n4. Provide liquidity to the $2m USD liquidity to TEMP/WFTM\n\nOriginal discussion: https://forum.tempus.finance/t/proposal-migrate-dex-liquidity-from-ethereum-to-fantom/125",
