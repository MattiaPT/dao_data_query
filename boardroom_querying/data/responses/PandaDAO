      "title": "Community Refund and Dissolution Proposal",
      "content": "We have noticed a lot of holders asking for refunds. As a DAO community, we follow the principles of decentralized governance.\nWhat people want, What pandas build.\n\nIt has been almost a year since PandaDAO was founded. We have escaped a lot of external market crises, but we have never discovered that the real crisis is the internal DAO governance.\n\nDevelopers have spent a lot of time building DAO governance and less time on the product side.\nPerhaps, DAOs are not suitable for highly complex coordinated development work or product incubation services.\n\nBut anyway, we are proud of succeeding in making some achievements.\nPandaDAO is the second community after ConstitutionDAO who manage to finish the refund process\n\nWe have developed AMM DEX protocol for the NFTs, which enables fragmentation of NFTs.\n\nWe have finished developing a management system for Web3 public-sentiment\n\nWe also have optimized the risk control for DAO multi-signer process by collaboration with Cobo.\n\nAnd, as it is known to all, we are the biggest DAO on Dework.\n\nBut, facing the economic depression, more and more users start looking for a refund solution. The community can’t wait any longer. \n\nTherefore, I propose as below:\n\n1. Burn Core’s token \n\nThere were 8 initial members when PandaDAO started. They were entitled to 5.57 million $PANDA individually, 44.56 million $PANDA in total.\nThe 8 members and community leaders will transfer 50 million $PANDA to the Eater Address.\n\n\n2. Remove the Uniswap liquidity pool\nIf the proposal is approved, we will remove $PANDA from the Uniswap liquidity pool and transfer all $PANDA to the Eater Address, all the rest of $ETH will be refunded according to the refund process.\n\n\n3. Treasury allocation\n\n3.1 All $PANDA Tokens will be burned by transferring to the Eater address.\n3.2 All $PEOPLE Tokens owned by treasury will be transferred to PeopleDAO multi-signer treasury and managed by PeopleDAO.\n3.3 We noticed that some invoices from our collaboration partners are still unpaid. We will solve the payments and then exchange all assets except $PEOPLE to $ETH, then put them back into the refund contract, which equals 1450-1600 $ETH in total. \n\n\n4. RPC contract \n\nERC721P 1.0 transfer work consumed quite some Gas. Meanwhile, $ETH was continually taken and exchanged to $LINK through the contract to ensure the fine function of 1.0. Therefore, there might be loss when the contract is used. Before a new protocol is put in use, the core team will continue the operation of ERC721P, to ensure a stable operation during the transfer period. Once RPC is transferred to a new contract, we will release the control right, and the RPC will spontaneously functionalize.\n\nRegardless of how the transfer work will be, it still anchors with $PANDA token, the  users will still be able to exchange RPC NFT to $PANDA and refund.\n\nAs for NFT transaction, 1% transaction fee will be set and it will be put into the refund contract. In this way, all NFT holders and token holders will be able to get more refunds. But some transaction fee settings might concern $WETH, we need to redesign the contract to a way that $WETH could be exchanged to $ETH. If we could not finish the contract redesigning, we will cancel all transaction fees for NFT deals.\n\n\n5. Codebase\n\nWe will upload the codebase of refund contract, VeToken contract, redeem contract and all related front-end and back-end codes to the official community Github right after we remove the private key of the developer and some sensitive information. And then release the Github control right.\n\n\n6. Staking contract\n\nPandaDAO offers 50 million $PANDA incentives for the Staking contract holders every year. Since there are still 100 days to go for the one-year contract, we will send 36 million $PANDA in total to the holders. Once the proposal is approved, we will take a snapshot of all staking contract holders, and allocate the incentive according to the address score.\n\n7. Refund contract\n\nCurrently, the actual circulation of $PANDA is approximately 1292859321.18, if we deduct the shares of the treasury and LP, the number will be around 600 million. If the proposal is approved, we will burn all $PANDA owned by PandaDAO multi-signer treasury, 50 million $PANDA owned by core team. All other tokens will be put as refund assets, with the amount of about 500-700 million in total.\n\nOnce we finish exchanging $ETH, we will put all $ETH into the refund contract. All individuals could exchange $PANDA to $ETH through the refund contact. All exchanged $PANDA will be burned immediately. The refund contract will be transferred to the Eater Address.\n\neach $PANDA refund=current amount of $ETH / $PANDA Circulation in the refund contract\n\n8. Official Discord and Social account\n\nOne week after the refund process, when contract control is burned, we will unregister and delete PandaDAO Discord server and all official social accounts.\n\n\nToo much time spent on governance issues, not enough time spent on development. But still, we believe in DAO miracles and the new work mode for the future.\n\nWe were the people who once walked the path to ConstitutionDAO. Thanks to all the partners who walked together with us, we hope you succeed and wish you all the best.\n\n\n\n\n\n社区退款和解散提案\n\n我们已经关注到很多人要求退款，作为一个DAO社区，我们遵循去中心化治理的原则。\nWhat people want, What pandas build.\n\nPandaDAO创建已经快1年的时间，我们躲过了大量的外部市场危机，却未曾发现，真正的危机是内部DAO治理。\n\n作为开发人员，我们花费了大量的时间在DAO治理建设上，在产品端投入了更少的时间。\n或许，DAO并不符合复杂度极高的协调开发工作或产品孵化服务。\n\n但是不管如何，我们创建了一些壮举。\n\nPandaDAO是除了ConstitutionDAO以外，第二大完成退款的DAO社区。\n\n我们也开发了NFT的AMM DEX协议，完成了NFT集合对ERC20的相互碎片化协议。\n\n我们还完成了Web3 舆情信息的集群管理系统。\n\n不仅如此，我们和Cobo合作，优化了DAO多签的风控管理。\n\n同时，我们也是Dework上最大的DAO，等等。\n\n但是，在市场萧条期，社区无法等待更久的时间，大量用户寻求退款。\n\n\n在此，我们发布以下提案：\n\n一：Core的持仓销毁计划\n\n初期的PandaDAO 总共有8 位core成员，他们平均从国库得到每个人有557万 PANDA，累计4456 万PANDA。\nPandaDAO早期的8位Core成员以及社区Leader会将5000万PANDA直接打入黑洞地址。\n\n二：Uni矿池移除计划\n如果该提案生效，我们会将PANDA 从Uni池子中移除，所有的PANDA打入黑洞地址，剩下的ETH将会执行退款程序。\n\n三：国库资产规划\n3.1 国库所有的PANDA Token将会全部打入到黑洞地址销毁\n\n3.2 国库所有People Token将会打到PeopleDAO多签国库，由PeopleDAO管理\n\n3.3 我们注意到，有部分合作方费用没有结算，我们将会把合作方费用全部结算后，把除People以外所有资产兑换成ETH，打入回购合约内，合计大约1450 - 1600个ETH。\n\n四：RPC规划\n\n因为ERC721P 1.0的迁移工作涉及到大量的Gas，而且前期1.0的使用需要持续从合约中提取ETH，并且兑换成Link充值到合约内，在整个协议运行的期间可能会产生亏损。在没有迁移到新协议之前，原先Core团队会持续运营 ERC721P，确保合约在1.0过渡期间可以稳定运行。\n在RPC从 ERC 721P 1.0 完全迁移到新合约后，我们将会销毁ERC721P 1.0的控制权，整个RPC将会自治运转。\n\n不管迁移工作如何进行，它依然锚定了PANDA Token，用户依然可以将RPC NFT兑换成PANDA，完成退款。\n\n针对NFT交易市场，RPC将会设置1%的交易手续费，并且全部转入退款合约内。让每个NFT持有者和Token holders有更多的退款。但是因为部分交易手续费涉及到WETH，我们需要在设计合约的过程中设置WETH可以被转换成ETH。如果无法在短时间内完成该合约设计，我们会取消全部NFT市场的交易手续费。\n\n\n五：代码库\n在去除开发者在代码中的一些私钥和敏感信息后，我们会将回购合约，VeToken合约，redeem合约及其各类前后端代码等将公开在社区官方Github，随后移除Github控制权限。\n\n\n六：Staking合约处理\nPandaDAO每年针对质押者提供5000万PANDA的激励。虽然合约没有满一年，还有大约100天解锁，因此我们将会针对质押者提供 3600万PANDA的激励发放。\n在提案生效后，我们会对所有的质押地址快照，按照每个地址的Score占比去分配。\n\n七：退款合约\n目前PANDA实际流通量在1292859321.18，扣除国库持有和LP的份额，实际流通数量在6亿左右。在提案生效后，我们会销毁PANDADAO多签国库持有的全部PANDA以及Core持有的5000万PANDA，合计大约5-7亿Token将会被直接退款。\n\n在兑换完成ETH后，我们将会所有的ETH打入到退款合约内，任何人可以从退款合约内，将PANDA兑换成ETH，所有兑换的PANDA将会被直接销毁，退款合约控制权将会转入到黑洞。\n\n平均每个PANDA的退款额 = 退款合约内的ETH / PANDA 当前总供应量\n\n\n八：Discord和社交账户\n在退款程序开启一周，并且合约控制权销毁后，我们将会注销PandaDAO Discord服务器和全部官方社交账户。\n\n\n\n太多时间在治理问题，\n太少时间在开发工作，\n但是，\n我们依旧相信DAO可以创造更多的奇迹，\n和新的协同工作模式。\n\n我们曾在ConstitutionDAO的路上继续前行，也希望有人能在我们的路上继续探索。",

      "title": "The Burn Scheme of PANDA held by Treasury",
      "content": "Treasury held 970298157$ PANDA till now, more than half of the total circulation. Therefore, we hereby issue a proposal to destroy part of the total tokens of the treasury after adding the expected repurchase and ensure that the necessary expenditure budget is adequate.\n\nThe positive effects of destroying an appropriate amount of tokens are as follows:\n\n1. From the perspective of market expectations, Treasury holding PANDA flows into the market in a large amount in the short term in any way, which is easy to cause the currency price to fall without sufficient new funds to replenish. A moderate amount of burning can reduce market expectations of selling pressure.\n\n2. For the same type of start-up projects, the current full circulation market value corresponding to the project valuation is on the high side. Destroying some tokens can lower valuations and further stimulate new capital inflows.\n\nThe limitations of excessive token destruction are as follows:\n\n1. From the perspective of Token & NFT Holders, we need to make a long-term and rational allocation of treasury tokens to bind the interests of contributors and value investors to the community for a long time. If too many tokens are destroyed, it will depress the space for long-term allocation of tokens, and there is no room for flexibility.\n\nConsidering the advantages and disadvantages of destruction, the specific destruction plan we put forward is as follows:\n\n1. The total amount of Treasury tokens is about $1.09 billion PANDA.\n\n2. The reserved portion is estimated to be $540 million PANDA, including possible future expenditures and incentives.\n\n3. The total destroyed portion amounts to $550 million PANDA, and the expected total amount of tokens will be destroyed except for the reserved portion.\n\n目前，国库拥有970,298,157 个 $PANDA，已经超过总发行量的一半以上。因此，我们在此发布提案，对国库已有加上预期回购后的总代币在保证必要支出预算充足的情况下进行销毁。\n\n适量代币销毁的正面效应如下：\n\n1. 从市场预期角度来看，国库持有PANDA以任何方式短期大量流入市场，在没有充足新资金补充进来的情况下，易造成币价下跌。适量销毁能降低市场对抛压的预期。\n2. 对标同类型初创项目，当前全流通市值对应项目估值偏高。销毁部分代币能降低估值，进一步激励新资金流入。\n\n过量代币销毁的局限性如下：\n\n1. 从Token & NFT Holders的角度看，我们需要对国库代币进行长期合理配置，将贡献者和价值投资者的利益与社区长期绑定。如果销毁代币量过多，将压低对代币进行长期配置的空间，且缺乏灵活变通的余地。\n\n综合销毁的利弊，我们提出的具体销毁方案如下：\n\n1. 国库代币总量约10.9亿$PANDA；\n\n2. 预留部分预计5.4亿$PANDA，包括未来可能的支出和激励发放；\n\n3. 销毁部分总计5.5亿$PANDA，代币预期总量除去预留部分都进行销毁。",

      "title": "Random Panda Club Mint Fee Refund Proposal",
      "content": "From the creation of PandaDAO to now, some people learn from our governance model, multi-signing scheme, treasury management, etc. And the community has more or less influenced the whole industry. the Core team hopes that the RPC project will have some positive impact on this industry and push the whole industry to work together to protect the funds of NFT players. Indeed, community revenue is very important, but if we can't protect the participants of the project, any Roadmap is just a loft in the air. We would rather see RPC grow in the long run than thinking about the immediate benefits.\n\nTherefore, we hereby release a proposal that, in addition to the blue chip purchase funds and the real pandas adoption fees, PandaDAO will exclude all NFT mint fees as community income and use them for permanent buyback (which can also be called a permanent refund program).\n\nBased on the design of ERC721P, the RPC NFT can be directly converted to a minimum of $50,000 PANDA. the previous community buyback proposal was for 50% of the total community revenue, but this proposal will use approximately 90% of the mint fees as a buyback process and not charge them to community revenue.\n\nMint fee processing process.\n\n1. At the end of Mint, the community will convert 90% of ETH into stablecoins. The remaining 10% ETH will be purchased for various blue chip NFTs, such as Bayc, Punks, Azuki, etc. and added to the ERC721P 2.0 liquidity pool from which RPC holders have a chance to redeem these blue chip NFTs. 2.\n\n2. In this 90% stablecoin, the community will spend $150,000-$200,000 to permanently adopt a real panda, and the community has the title rights to the panda. Each year, the community can randomly select a few people from RPC holders to get up close and personal with our adopted pandas. If the adoption fails, we will return the funds to the buy-back contract. 3.\n\n3. Excluding the adoption fee, the community will deposit all stable coins into curve and other mining pool pledges, which will be hosted by the community treasury. Whenever the stablecoin in the repurchase contract is less than $30,000, the community multi-signer will credit the stablecoin into the repurchase contract to ensure that there is enough stablecoin in the contract for everyone to exit freely. Since a large amount of stablecoin is in pledged status and can be withdrawn at any time, the community will also generate some staking revenue to cover the previous development costs of the RPC project.\n\nRefund process for RPC holders.\n1. RPC holders can exchange the anchored $PANDA based on the ERC721P protocol.\n\n2. $PANDA will be exchanged for stablecoin assets such as DAI through a community buyback agreement.\n\nAlthough this proposal will reduce the community's revenue and disposable funds, in the long run, the community will generate a lot of staking revenue and protect all project participants so that the RPC project can run for a long time, thus giving birth to various cultures, features, empowerment, etc.\n\nReference.\n1.

ERC721P operating principle: https://pandadao.medium.com/erc721p-jingzhe-code-is-law-8347c5b42748\n\n___\n\nPandaDAO从创建到现在，一些同行学习我们的治理模型，多签方案，国库管理等，而社区对整个行业或多或少有一些影响。Core团队希望RPC项目对这个行业产生一些积极的影响，推动整个行业共同保障NFT玩家的资金安全。的确，社区的营收非常重要，但是如果我们不能保护好项目的参与者，任何Roadmap都是空中阁楼。我们更希望RPC能长远的发展下去，而不是惦记这眼前的利益。\n\n\b因此，我们在此发布提案，除了蓝筹购买资金和真实的大熊猫认养费用，PandaDAO将把所有NFT mint费用不记作社区收入，用作永久性回购（也可以称为永久性退款方案）。\n\n基于ERC721P的设计，RPC NFT可以直接转换为最低 50,000 $PANDA。之前社区的回购提案是社区总收入的50%，但是该提案希望将大约90%的mint费用用作回购程序，不记作社区收入。\n\nMint费用处理流程：\n\n1. 在Mint结束后，社区会将90%ETH兑换成稳定币。剩余10% ETH 将会购买各类蓝筹NFT，比如Bayc，Punks，Azuki等，并且加入ERC721P 2.0 流动性池子，RPC持有者有几率从流动性池子中兑换出这些蓝筹NFT。\n\n2. 在这90%的稳定币中，社区将会花费15万-20万美金永久认养一只真正的大熊猫，并且社区对大熊猫具有冠名权。每年，社区可以从RPC持有者中随机抽取数人，近距离接触我们认养的大熊猫。如果认养失败，我们将会把这部分资金返回至回购合约内。\n\n3. 排除认养费用，社区将会把所有稳定币存入curve等矿池质押，由社区大国库进行托管。每当回购合约内的稳定币少于3万美金，社区多签人会将稳定币打入回购合约内，确保合约内有充足的稳定币可以让每个人自由退出。由于大量的稳定币处于质押状态，并且随时可以提取，社区也将会产生一些staking收益，弥补RPC项目之前的开发成本。\n\nRPC持有者退款流程：\n1. RPC持有者可以基于ERC721P协议，兑换出锚定的$PANDA。\n\n2. 将$PANDA通过社区回购协议，兑换成DAI等稳定币资产。\n\n虽然该提案会降低社区的营收以及可支配资金，但是从长远来看，社区将会产生大量的staking 收益，并且保护好所有项目参与者，使得RPC项目可以长久的运行下去，从而诞生出各种各样的文化，特性，赋能等。\n\n参考：\n1.

      "title": "PeopleDAO airdrop redistribution",
      "content": "## Proposal Purpose\n\nIn previous airdrop activities, airdropped token was distributed to so large amount of People holders’ addresses  that each address could receive very few tokens. With considerable amount of token unclaimed and for give those unrealized value to PeopleDAO which is an early supporter of PandaDAO, we plan to redistribute those tokens to PeopleDAO’s ERC721P whitelist addresses.\n\nAll token redistributed is 2,500,000 💲PANDA for 50 whitelist addresses’ minting fee. The distribution addresses of those whitelist for PeopleDAO is decided on their own.\n\n## Positive Effects of The Proposal \n\nWith considerate amount airdropped token for People unclaimed,  it’s a promise of PandaDAO’s credit to redistribute unrealized value.\n\nAt the same time, those token is redistribute for NFT minting which is positive move for successful launch of NFT.\n\n## Negative Effects of The Proposal\nDue to the whitelisting of free mint for the PeopleDAO community, we need to ensure that the value is distributed to the supporters of the NFT project and not to speculators. During the distribution, it should be ensured that the tokens are used in RPC projects (NFT projects) and do not cause a serious sell-off to the market.\n\n## Proposal implementation details\n1. The PandaDAO treasury will first mint 50 NTF.\n2. Based on the whitelist address provided by PeopleDAO, we will send these 50 NTFs to them\n3. the sending time will be at the beginning of WL mint.\n4. 2.5 million PANDAs will be deposited into the NFT liquidity pool afterwards\n\n## 提案原因\n\n在之前的空投活动中，由于被空投的People持有者数量巨大，以至于每个地址能领取的代币数量很少。考虑到大量的空投代币未被领取、同时为了将这部分价值重新赋予早期给予我们支持的PeopleDAO社区，我们计划将这部分代币再分配给PeopleDAO的NFT白名单持有者。\n\n累积将250万个PANDA代币再分发给50个白名单地址的持有者，他们无需再次购买token用于NFT铸造。PeopleDAO的WL由PeopleDAO社区自行安排发送。\n\n## 提案积极影响\n由于之前空投代币未被领取，再分发将兑现之前承诺的价值分配，保证PandaDAO社区的信用。\n\n同时该部分token的分发用于ERC721P的铸造，也有利于NFT项目的发行。\n\n## 提案负面影响\n由于为PeopleDAO社区提供了free mint的白名单，我们需要保证价值分发给NFT项目的支持者而非投机者。在分发的过程中，应该确保代币使用在RPC项目中（NFT项目），并且不对市场造成严重的抛压。\n\n## 提案执行细节\n1. PandaDAO国库将会先mint 50 个NTF。\n2. 根据PeopleDAO提供的白名单地址，我们将把这50个NFT发送给他们\n3. 发送时间在WL mint开始阶段。\n4. 随后往NFT 流动性池子存入 250万个PANDA\n",

      "title": "ERC721P Dedicated Budget",
      "content": "Introduction\nERC721P is an NFT project developed by the community alone, whether it is contract design or pictures all from the bottom.\nThe project involves the construction of the LP pool of NFT, which requires a large amount of $PANDA Token.\nIt has exceeded the community's daily operating budget and needs to be entered into a community Snapshot referendum, with the voting results eventually going to a multi-signer for review.\n\nProposal Details\nERC721P There are three rounds of mint in total, the first round is the Dutch Snapshot, the second round is the WL mint, and the third round is the contract LP interaction.\nCurrently only the first round is using ETH, the later ones are using $PANDA circulating in the market without treasury spending.\nThe total number of NFTs will be 10,000, of which about 8,000-9,000 will enter the market circulation and the rest will be locked in the LP pool.\nThe community will need to draw a certain amount of Panda tokens from the treasury, which will anchor the NFT price for the first round of Dutch auction.\n\nWe do not currently know the final execution of the Dutch auction, but we can ensure that every $PANDA token called by the treasury has a corresponding collateral and is not released unsecured.\nBecause all of ChainLink's consumption is in LINK tokens to offset the Gas fee, in the process of using LINK as a prophecy machine, the ERC721P contract is also able to continuously convert LINK into ETH. The ERC721P contract will be hosted by the community treasury address, and each month the community will occasionally convert ETH within the contract into LINK, satisfying The ERC721P contract will be hosted by the community treasury address, and the community will exchange ETH into LINK from time to time each month to meet the interactive needs of the ERC721P contract.\n\nPositive Impact of the Proposal\n\nERC721P because of the LP design, the entire NFT pool will continuously generate some fees, some of which will hit the LP pool and be used as the anchor price growth of NFT, and some of which will go directly to the community treasury to generate passive revenue.\nAnd the ERC721P protocol can only use PANDA tokens for interaction, increasing the utility of community governance tokens.\nAt the same time a large number of tokens are locked within the ERC721P protocol, the amount of token pledged within the PandaDAO staking contract will drop dramatically and APY gains will rise with it.\n\nProposal Negative Impact\n\nEach ERC721P corresponds to a certain number of PANDA tokens, and NFT holders have corresponding governance rights to the community, ultimately traveling their voting rights with the PANDA tokens corresponding to NFT, and the community needs to balance the positions of both NFT holders and regular Token holders. Because the ERC721P protocol has a free exit nature that prevents a bear market in NFT from coming, any holder can freely exchange ERC721P and PANDA tokens at any time. When a large number of NFTs are exchanged for Panda tokens, the tokens will suffer a massive sell-off. But because each token release has a corresponding collateral, the community will use the treasury to take on any risk of a sell-off.\n\nBudget details\nMeanwhile the first round of Dutch auction, the community will add a large amount of ETH revenue, and the community's passive revenue in other DEFI platforms will increase.\nWe plan to apply to the treasury for a spending limit of 500 million PANDA tokens, ultimately based on the number of Dutch auctions * initial anchor price.\nAlso request $20,000 to purchase LINK for random parameter acquisition for the prophecy machine.\n\nERC721P Tech Details:\nhttps://docs.pandadao.xyz/erc721p/erc721p-v1-jing-zhe-ban\n\n前言\nERC721P是社区独自研发的NFT项目，不管是合约设计还是图片全部从底层做起。\n该项目涉及到NFT的LP池建设，需要大量的$PANDA Token。\n已经超过社区的日常运营预算，需要进入社区Snapshot公投，最终将投票结果交由多签人审核。\n\n提案详情\nERC721P 总共有三轮mint，第一轮是荷兰拍，第二轮是WL mint，第三轮是合约LP交互。\n目前只有第一轮是使用ETH，后面的都是使用市场上流通的$PANDA，无需国库开支。\nNFT总数量会有1万个，其中大约8000-9000个会进入市场流通，其余的则锁定在LP池子内。\n社区需要从国库内抽取一定量的Panda代币，以此锚定第一轮荷兰拍的NFT价格。\n\n目前我们并不清楚荷兰拍最终的执行情况，但是我们可以确保，国库调用的每一个$PANDA代币，都有对应的抵押物，而不是无抵押释放。\n因为ChainLink所有的消耗都是以LINK代币去抵消Gas fee，在使用LINK作为预言机的过程中，ERC721P合约也能源源不断的把LINK兑换成ETH，ERC721P合约将由社区国库地址托管，每个月社区会不定期将合约内的ETH兑换成LINK，满足ERC721P合约的交互需求。\n\n提案正面影响\n\nERC721P因为LP的设计，整个NFT池子会源源不断的产生一些手续费，其中一部分会打入LP池子，用作NFT的锚定价格增长，另外一部分会直接进入社区国库，产生被动收益。\n并且ERC721P协议只能使用PANDA代币进行交互，增加社区治理代币的实用性。\n同时大量的代币被锁定在ERC721P协议内，PandaDAO staking合约内的代币质押量会急剧下降，APY收益也会随着上涨。\n\n提案负面影响\n\n每个ERC721P 都对应了一定数量的PANDA代币，NFT持有者对社区也拥有对应的治理权利，最终以NFT对应的PANDA代币行驶他们的投票权，社区需要兼顾NFT持有者和普通Token持有者双方的立场。因为ERC721P协议拥有自由退出的性质，防止NFT的熊市来袭，任何持有者可以随时将ERC721P和PANDA代币自由兑换。当有大量NFT被置换成Panda代币，代币会遭受大量的抛压。但是因为每一枚代币的释放都有对应的抵押物，社区将会动用国库，承接一切的抛压风险。\n\n预算详情\n同时第一轮的荷兰拍，社区将会增加大量的ETH收益，社区在其它DEFI平台的被动收益将会提高。\n我们计划向国库申请5亿 PANDA代币的开支上限，最终以荷兰拍拍卖数量* 初期锚定价格为准。\n同时申请2万美金购买LINK，用作预言机的随机参数获取。\n\nERC721P 惊蛰版技术详情：\nhttps://docs.pandadao.xyz/erc721p/erc721p-v1-jing-zhe-ban",

      "title": "Panda Staking Incentive Proposal (Panda质押激励提案)",
      "content": "In the whitepaper, we plan to give 10% of the community revenue to Token stakers.\nIn order to increase the number of Token repurchases, and the income expectations of pledgers, giving more incentives to long-term holders.\n\nWe propose here to remove the 10% VeToken earnings and shift it to community Token repurchase, which means the community Token repurchase will be increased from 40% to 50% of revenue.\nAt the same time staking incentives are distributed in a fixed number of $PANDA, the final number of which will be confirmed by community vote.\n\nVeToken working model: Each block has a corresponding score, and the current number of pledges is used to evenly divide the score of each block. At the end of the year we will count the scores of all blocks, get the score of each staking address, and finally allocate the staking incentive.\n\nExample: Suppose each block has 100 points and address A has staked 100 $PANDA and address B has staked 100 $PANDA.\nAfter 10 blocks, address A receives 500 points and address B receives 500 points.\nThen address B cancels the staking and address A keeps the staking of 100 Tokens.\nAfter 10 blocks, address A accumulated 1500 points and address B remained the same with 500 points.\n\nWe have now repurchased over 50 millions $Panda and have set the maximum cap number at 50 million $PANDA because of the large number of Token locks and future funding for ERC721P.\nFinal stakers earnings are confirmed by community vote.\n\n在白皮书中，我们计划了10%的社区收益给予Token质押者。\n为了增加Token回购数量，和质押者的收入预期，给予长期持有者更多激励。\n\n我们在此提案取消10%的VeToken收益，转变为社区Token回购，也就代表社区的Token回购将由收入的40%上调至50%。\n同时质押激励以固定的 $PANDA进行发放，最终发放数量由社区投票确认。\n\nVeToken工作模式：每个区块有对应的分值，由当前质押数量去均分每个区块的分值，在年终我们将会统计所有区块的分值，得到每个质押地址的得分，最终分配质押激励。\n\n例子：假设每个区块100分，A地址质押了100个 $PANDA，B地址也质押了100个 $PANDA。\n10个区块后，A地址得到500分，B地址得到500分。\n随后B地址取消了质押，A地址还是保持100个Token的质押。\n10个区块后，A地址累计得到1500分，B地址还是500分不变。\n\n目前我们已经回购了超过5000万个Panda Token，并且因为ERC721P的大量Token锁仓和未来的融资，我们将最大上限数设定在5000万个$PANDA。\n最终质押者的收益由社区投票确认。",

      "content": "At present, our treasury holds $4.23 million DAI. Profitable investment and effective risk management of these assets will be financially supportive for the long-term development of the community.\n\nIn the last proposal for treasury investment, we’ve put forward a detailed portfolio based on stablecoin mining. After sufficient and thorough community discussion, we further clarified the basic principle of treasury investment and strengthened the emphasis on risk management.\n\nFirst of all, the basic principles of treasury investment are as follows:\n\n1. The responsibility of the treasury is to ensure the long-term development of the project and the stable operation of the community rather than earning by gambling market’s trend. \n2. The treasury portfolio is limited to stable currency investment that are very low-risk and controllable. Any medium-and high-risk investments are not fit for it.\n3. The treasury investment is completely transparent. Investment logic and potential risks are fully disclosed to community.  Risk management plan is also prepared for extremely bad conditions.\n\nSecondly, this proposal includes a professional and comprehensive disclosure of treasury portfolio’s risk management based on diligent research as well plans for risk control. Once the proposal is passed, the stable currency investment of the treasury will be carried out as soon as possible.\n\n**Allocation details**\nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1H-jmjzEo-z87N7mbkrF7U6nmsi32IwEOk-WzH6VTSug/edit#gid=0\n\n**Underlying logic**\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZsUAPQ7l-zYzw8bDf9J3NncIl8V0XsuKxWLm96Bn8aE/edit\n\n**Risk Management**\nhttps://internetplus.notion.site/Risk-Management-of-PandaDAO-s-Treasury-1373c4f10ee9439aa8f45f583f31f27e\n\n目前国库持有423万美金左右的稳定币DAI，针对这部分资产的妥善管理将为社区的长远发展提供稳定保障。\n\n在上一次国库资金管理提案中，我们已经提出了详实的稳定币挖矿方案。在经过更充分的社区讨论后，我们进一步明确了国库投资的底线原则以及加强了对风险控制的重视。\n\n首先，国库投资的底线原则如下：\n\n1. 国库职责是保证项目的长期发展和社区的稳定运营，而非赚市场风险的钱；\n2. 国库只做风险极低且可控的稳定币投资， 中高风险投资不在此投资方案的考虑范围内；\n3. 国库投资完全公开透明且充分披露投资逻辑与潜在风险，并针对潜在风险制定风控方案。\n\n其次，经过大量的调研，本次提案针对国库资金管理方案的风险做了专业和充分披露，并有针对性地制定了风控方案。本提案通过之后，将尽快进行国库的稳定币投资。\n\n分配细节\nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1H-jmjzEo-z87N7mbkrF7U6nmsi32IwEOk-WzH6VTSug/edit#gid=0\n\n底层逻辑\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZsUAPQ7l-zYzw8bDf9J3NncIl8V0XsuKxWLm96Bn8aE/edit\n\n风控方案\nhttps://internetplus.notion.site/Risk-Management-of-PandaDAO-s-Treasury-1373c4f10ee9439aa8f45f583f31f27e",

      "title": "PeopleDAO Funding Proposal Update（PeopleDAO资助提案更新）",
      "content": "In the white paper, PandaDAO will give PeopleDAO 5% of the fundraising amount, 5% of the token and 5% of the community's annual income.\n\nHowever, due to the rapid increase in financing, it has exceeded all expectations and the token supply has also multiplied several times. To this end, the community plans to repurchase Token, and is also designing a deflation mechanism and application mechanism, which requires a lot of money. \nIf the white paper plan is followed, the main DAO will immediately extract 10% of the subDAO's treasury funds and all 5% of the community's taxes and fees in the future, whichIt will also cause some burden to the PandaDAO community and damage the rights and interests of subDAO investors.\n\nFirst of all, JuiceBox cut the handling fee in half during our financing process, and added investment in the later stage. At the same time, the Core team and Leaders cancel all future incentives, etc. Everything is for the long-term development of the community. In the early stage, PeopleDAO acted as the multi-signer of the community, safely hosted a large number of community assets, and carried out the initial publicity.\nLanguageDAO helped PeopleDAO to complete the preliminary white paper compilation and draft compilation.\n\nIn order to be better all $PEOPLE holders, the PandaDAO community post the proposal:\n\n1. The PandaDAO community will directly exchange 2.5% of the financing amount (42.5 ETH) into $PEOPLE for asset reserves.\n\n2. 0.5% of the financing amount (8.5 ETH) to fund LanguageDAO. Also to thank LanguageDAO for its early gratuitous help to PandaDAO.\n\n3. 2% of ETH (34 ETH) is funded to PeopleDAO, and thanks PeopleDAO for its early support and multi-signature management of the PandaDAO community.\n\n4. To protect PandaDAO's investors and contributors, abolish PeopleDAO's 5% annual profit tax on PandaDAO. However, in order be good all $PEOPLE holders and maintain the consensus of the community. The PandaDAO community will directly convert 5% of its profits into $PEOPLE tokens to hold every year.\n\n5. In order to benefit more $PEOPLE holders and for the development of the PandaDAO community. We will airdrop an average of 0.5% supply of $PANDA to all $PEOPLE holders. It will not cause Token selling pressure, and all $PANDA holders can also join the PandaDAO mining system.\n\n6. 2% of the total supply of $PANDA is sent to PeopleDAO, and the two parties form a community of interests.\n\n\nAll of these purposes are to maintain a closer relationship with other DAOs while protecting the rights and interests of the community.\n\n\nDumping restrictions: In order to avoid affecting the token prices of both DAO communities, PeopleDAO and PandaDAO cannot send or sell 0.25% of the total supply of each other's community tokens through incentives every quarter.\n\n***\n\n在白皮书中，我们约定给予PeopleDAO 5%的募资额，5%的Token和社区每年5%的收益。\n\n但是，由于融资额的快速增加，已经超出了所有人的预期，并且代币供应量也翻了数倍。为此，社区计划对Token进行回购，也在设计通缩机制和应用机制，为此需要投入大量的资金。如果遵守白皮书规划，主DAO会立刻抽取subDAO 10%的国库资金和未来社区所有5%的税费，对PandaDAO社区也会造成一些负担，损害到subDAO投资者的权益。\n\n首先JuiceBox在我们融资过程中，将手续费缩减一半，并且在后期追加了投资。同时Core团队和Leaders取消了未来所有的激励等。所有的一切都是为了社区更长远的发展。而前期PeopleDAO担任了社区的多签人，安全托管大量的社区资产，进行了最初的宣发。LanguageDAO帮助PandaDAO完成了前期的白皮书编译工作和草案的编译工作。\n\n为了更好的对所有$PEOPLE持有者赋能，也为了和其它DAO社区形成利益共同体，PandaDAO社区发起以下提案：\n\n1. PandaDAO社区会将2.5%的融资额(42.5 ETH)直接兑换成$PEOPLE用作资产储备。\n\n2. 0.5%的融资额（8.5 ETH）资助LanguageDAO。也为了感谢LanguageDAO早期对PandaDAO的无偿帮助。\n\n3. 2%的ETH (34 ETH)资助给PeopleDAO，也感谢PeopleDAO早期对PandaDAO社区的支持和多签管理。\n\n4. 为了保护PandaDAO的投资者和贡献者，取消PeopleDAO对PandaDAO每年5%的盈利税收。不过为了对所有 $PEOPLE持有者赋能，维护社区的共识。PandaDAO社区每年会将5%的盈利直接兑换成$PEOPLE代币持有。\n\n5. 为了让更多 $PEOPLE持有人获益，也为了PandaDAO社区的发展。我们会向所有$PEOPLE持有人平均空投0.5%的$PANDA。此举不会造成Token的抛压，同时所有$PANDA持有人也可以加入到PandaDAO的挖矿系统。\n\n6. 2%总供应量的$PANDA打给PeopleDAO，双方形成利益共同体。\n\n\n这些目的都是为了在保障社区权益的情况下，同时和其它DAO的关系更加紧密。\n\n\n倾销限制：为避免对双方DAO社区的Token价格产生影响，PeopleDAO和PandaDAO每季度不能通过激励送出或卖出总供应量0.25%的对方社区的代币。",

We initiate a new proposal to update the repurchase price range, other conditions remain unchanged, and the community will vote to confirm the final repurchase conditions.\n\nWe also explain again why we have to do the repurchase.\n\n1. The ERC721P protocol will need to lock a large number of tokens, causing severe market deflation. The treasury needs to prepare a large number of tokens for this purpose, which will be used for incentive issuance in the next few years.\n\n2. The strategic investment of institutions, organizations and individuals will also reduce the Token reserves of the community treasury.\n\n3. Long-term low prices are not conducive to community development and the market, but also to protect early secondary investors and long-term holders.\n\n4. The repurchase time is as long as one year. On the premise that the original community profit will be repurchased by 40%, the repurchase limit of 200 ETH will continue to be increased.\n\n\nOptions:\n1. Any price below 0.014\n2. Any price below 0.01\n3. Any price below 0.007\n\n***\n\n上一个提案中，我们将回购条件设置在0.007 USD以下，但是社区很难达到回购条件。我们在此发起提案，对回购价格区间进行修改，其它条件不变，由社区进行投票，确认最终回购条件。\n\n我们也再一次说明为什么执行回购。\n\n1. ERC721P协议将需要锁定大量代币，造成市场严重通缩，国库需要为此准备大量Token，用作未来数年的激励发放。\n\n2. 机构，组织和个人的战略投资也会造成社区国库Token储备减少。\n\n3. 长期低迷的价格不利于社区发展和市场，也是为了保护早期的二级投资者和长期持有者。\n\n4. 回购时间长达一年，是在原有社区利润40%回购的前提下，继续增加200 ETH的回购上限。\n\n\n选项：\n1. 0.014以下任意价格\n2. 0.01以下任意价格\n3. 0.007以下任意价格 ",

      "content": "## Token Repurchase\nAlthough we have opened the refund contract, there are still a large number of tokens circulating in the market, which has exceeded our initial expectations and caused huge selling pressure on the market.\n\nIn the future, some investment institutions may enter the PandaDAO community, but if we agree to accept the investment, it will lead to a large reduction in the $Panda stored in the community treasury.\n\nAt the same time, the long-term low price is not good for the construction of the community. In order to protect all early investors, and to protect users who bought $Panda in the secondary market to the greatest extent, the community proposed to the treasury to use 200 ETH as a repurchase.\n\nRepurchase Conditions:\n1. Repurchase period: 1 year\n2. Repurchase price:  Below 0.007 USD\n3. Repurchase Reserve: 200 ETH\n\nRepurchase process:\n1. When the above conditions are met, the core team can apply to the multisig to execute the repurchase procedure and repurchase any number of tokens within the effective time of the proposal.\n2. All repurchase procedures are initiated by the core team, executed by multiple signers, and can only be traded on DEX, not outside the multisig wallet\n\n## Token Owner Destruction\nAt the same time, we are also proposing to destroy the control owner role of Panda ERC20 Token after the security audit of the Token contract and VeToken contract is completed, so as to avoid any possibility of additional issuance of Token in the future.\n\n## Treasury Allocation\nCurrently most of the treasury assets exist in two forms\n1. $PANDA tokens, community governance tokens\n2. $ETH\n\nAnd ETH itself is a risky asset with big price volatility, which may cause a sharp decrease in treasury value in special times.\nAfter close research and consideration, we will consider replacing ETH and non-$PANDA risky assets with stable coins with low price volatility and low risk, and combine with on-chain defi blue chip projects for stable coin farming to earn stable and low-risk income. Add a significant amount of revenue to the treasury\n\nA brief description of the process\n1. the valuable $PANDA tokens will not be touched\n2. ETH and other non-$PANDA assets in the treasury will be mostly exchanged for stablecoins\n3. Select suitable defi blue chip projects and trustworthy fund custodian services for stablecoins to make low-risk stablecoin investments to increase treasury assets.\n\nBrief conclusion (the exact amount is subject to actual execution and may vary somewhat):\n1. the FRAX-DAI UNIV3 pool on frax.finance combined with UniswapV3 for a three-month lock-in period, approximately $700,000\n2. the UST-wormhole pool on the Convex platform for about $3,300,000\n3. Cobo-Wallet fund custody, about $300,000\n\nDetailed Treasury asset allocation and expected return calculation table:\nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1H-jmjzEo-z87N7mbkrF7U6nmsi32IwEOk-WzH6VTSug/edit#gid=0\n\nAllocation ideas and research: \nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZsUAPQ7l-zYzw8bDf9J3NncIl8V0XsuKxWLm96Bn8aE/edit?usp=sharing\n\nDisclaimer\n1. This proposal is implemented independently as an investment strategy for the treasury's free money only. If a proposal requiring the expenditure of funds is passed, the relevant investment will take out the corresponding share to support the corresponding proposal.\n2. The specific targets may be adjusted according to market conditions, but the general idea is the same.\n\n## Proposal Options：\n1. Agreement with Token Repurchase\n2. Agreement with Token Owner Destruction\n3. Agreement with Treasury Allocation\n4. Disagreement with Token Repurchase\n5. Disagreement with Token Owner Destruction\n6. Disagreement with Treasury Allocation\n\n***\n\n## 回购提案\n虽然我们开启了退款合约，但是还有大量的Token在市场上流通，已经超出了我们的最初预期，对市场造成了巨大的抛压。\n\n未来社区也许会有一些投资机构进入，但是如果社区同意接受投资，则会导致社区国库内存储的Token大量减少。\n\n同时，长时间低迷的价格，对社区的建设也不利。为了保障所有早期投资者，也为了最大程度保护二级市场购买的用户，社区向国库提案，希望拿出200 ETH用作回购，该回购也属于一个托底价格。\n\n回购条件：\n1. 回购时间：持续1年\b\n2. 回购价格：0.007 USD以下\n3. 回购储备金：200 ETH\n\n回购流程：\n1. 当满足上述条件时，核心团队可以向多签人申请执行回购程序，在提案生效时间内回购任意数量的代币。\n2. 所有回购程序由核心团队发起，多签人执行，只能在DEX进行交易，不可在多签钱包外执行\n\n## 合约控制权销毁\n同时，我们也在此提案，在Token合约和VeToken合约完成安全审计后，销毁ERC20的合约控制权限，避免未来以任何的可能性对Token进行增发。\n\n## 国库资金分配管理\n目前国库资产大多数都以两种形态存在\n1. $PANDA代币，社区治理代币\n2. ETH\n\n而ETH本身是价格波动极大的风险资产，可能在特殊时期造成国库价值锐减。\n估经过严密的调研和思考后，我们会考虑将ETH及非$PANDA风险资产替换为价格波动小，风险低的稳定币，并结合链上defi蓝筹项目进行稳定币挖矿来赚取稳定、低风险的收益。为国库增加一笔不菲的收入\n\n简要过程说明\n1. 宝贵的$PANDA代币不会动\n2. 国库中ETH及其他非$PANDA资产会大部分换为稳定币\n3. 针对稳定币选择合适的defi蓝筹项目、值得信赖的资金托管服务，进行低风险稳定币投资，来增加国库资产。\n\n简要结论说明（具体金额以实际执行为准，会有一定的偏差）:\n1. 在frax.finance结合uniswapV3 的 三个月锁定期的 FRAX-DAI UNIV3 池，大约 $700,000\n2. Convex平台上的 UST-wormhole 池 大约 $3,300,000\n3. Cobo-Wallet 资金托管，大约 $300,000\n\n详细分配计划与策略可见: \n\n详细国库资产分配及预期收益计算表:\nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1H-jmjzEo-z87N7mbkrF7U6nmsi32IwEOk-WzH6VTSug/edit#gid=0\n\n分配思路与调研: \nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZsUAPQ7l-zYzw8bDf9J3NncIl8V0XsuKxWLm96Bn8aE/edit?usp=sharing\n\n声明\n1. 本提案独立执行，仅作为国库闲钱投资策略，若有需要花费资金的提案通过，相关投资都会取出对应份额支持相应提案。\n2. 具体的标的，可能会根据市场情况作出一定的调整，但总体思路是一致的\n\n## 提案选项：\n1. 同意回购提案\n2. 同意销毁合约控制权\n3. 同意国库分配提案\n4. 不同意回购提案\n5. 不同意销毁合约控制权\n6. 不同意国库分配提案",

      "content": "Thank you all very much for your support of PandaDAO. This is the first incentive distribution for the community's core contributors (developers, community managers, project sponsors, etc.) for the past almost 5 months (from inception to present). However, considering that the amount of funding for PandaDAO exceeded the initial target amount by a large margin, if we were to follow the white paper's narrative of \"a linear allocation of 12% of the total token supply for one year to the core team for incentives\", it would cause a serious dumping expectation of the market, harming the interests of all investors and creating an unfair distribution of incentives to the community. And we also found that the cumbersome process of applying for funding from the treasury guardians by the DAO community would cause inefficiencies in execution and efficiency.\nThe core team incentives are as follows.\n\nthe start date of the allocation starts from last November, only the five-month incentive cycle is allocated, and then the earlier work and the April work cycle before that are not counted in this incentive.\nFor the type of tokens to be allocated, we propose to allocate $PANDA tokens and Ether in different proportions, 50% in the form of ETH and 50% in the form of $PANDA.\n3.In order to tie the interests of the core members to the community, all core members need to have a position of $3 million or more in $PANDA and the Leader needs to have a position of 8 million or more in $PANDA.\nThis proposal is a one-time proposal, and the core team's allocation plan will be cancelled, and the incentive and allocation will follow the budget of different teams to ensure the interests of the community and the long-term motivation of the core team. Incentives from April onwards will be implemented by the budget proposal.\nThe proposed changes to the community incentives are as follows.\n\nThe community will request a monthly budget of $150,000 from the treasury for development, design, marketing, mods, servers, DDoS traffic cleaning, etc. All budgets will be credited to a multi-signature wallet controlled by the core members.\nThe $PANDA within the budgeted funds cannot exceed 80% or less than 50% of the current month's budget, and the remaining portion will be distributed in stable coins or ETH equivalent.\nNo more than $150,000 in digital assets of equivalent value in the multi-signature wallet controlled by the core team, and no monthly budget overlap. And every month, all incentive allocation details (quantity, address, discord account, Tasks, etc.) will be published, and if the budget needs to be increased, the entire community Snapshot vote will be required to confirm.\nevery month, the development team and the operation team's leaders need to compete for the next month's budget schedule, both sides to form a check and balance. The core team will review the budgets of both teams and hit the multi-signature wallet jointly controlled by the team leaders of both teams, and the team leaders of both teams will allocate incentives to all those who complete Tasks.\nTo avoid centralized control of each team, each team needs to have 4-5 team leaders, and the community leaders will also join in the multi-signature wallet, which can also perfectly evaluate the incentive amount of each task.\nteam leaders of the development team contains: 1 front-end engineer, 1 system back-end engineer, 1 designer, 1 contract engineer.\nteam leaders of the operation team: 2 mods, 1 marketer, 1 product manager\nIn order to increase the diversity of the core team's job types and make it easier to listen and discuss the community, we have made the following plans for the core team.\ncore team members need to have a position of 3 million tokens or more, and their wallets need to be publicized and firmly bound to the interests of the community.\nThe core team will be expanded by adding 1 Mod Leader, 1 Product Leader and 1 Marketing Leader.\neliminate two developers from the core team and increase the voice of the operation team in the community.\nAccording to the above plan, the release rate of community tokens will be less than 16% a year, with a minimum release rate of 8% a year, which can also protect all investors and community contributors.\n\n非常感谢大家对 PandaDAO 的支持。这是第一个针对社区在过去接近5个月（从立项至今）的核心贡献者（开发者、社区管理者、项目发起人等）的第一次激励分配。但考虑到PandaDAO融资数额超出最开始预定的数额太多，如果还按照白皮书当中所叙述：『将代币总供应量的12%一年的线性分配给核心工作团队进行激励』，将会对市场造成严重的抛压，损害到所有投资者的利益，也会造成社区激励分配不公平的情况。并且我们也发现DAO社区在向国库守卫者申请资金的繁琐程序，会造成执行力和效率的低下。\n\n核心团队在此提议，取消所有团队的激励，而核心团队只分配前面五个月的激励，取消4月1日以后的所有激励，并且对白皮的激励分配重新修改和调整。\n\n核心团队激励如下：\n\n分配开始日期从去年11月份开始，仅计五个月的激励周期分配，再之前的早期工作以及四月的工作周期，不计入本次激励。\n针对分配代币种类，我们提议以不同代币比例去分配Panda代币以及以太坊，50%以ETH形式发放，50%以$Panda发放。\n核心团队总共10人，平均每个月每人的分配数量725,209个$panda和1.45个ETH。为了使核心成员和社区利益绑定，所有的核心成员的 $Panda持仓量需要大于等于300万枚，Leader的持仓需要大于800万枚。\n本次提案为一次性提案，后续会取消核心团队的所有分配计划，跟随不同团队的预算进行激励和分配来保证社区的利益以及核心团队的长期动力。从四月开始的激励，将会由预算提案执行\n社区激励修改提案如下：\n\n社区每个月向国库申请15万美金的预算，用作开发，设计，市场，Mod，服务器，DDOS流量清洗等所有开支，所有预算会打入核心成员控制的多签钱包内。\n预算资金内的$Panda不可超过当月预算的80%或低于50%，剩余部分则以稳定币或等值的ETH进行发放。\n核心团队控制的多签钱包内，不可超过15万美金等值的数字资产，不可每个月进行预算叠加。并且每个月公示全部的激励分配详情（数量，地址，discord账号，Tasks等），如发需要增加预算，需要进行全体社区Snapshot投票确认。\n每个月，开发组和运营组的leaders需要争取下个月的预算表，双方形成一个制衡。由核心团队审核双方小组的预算，打到两个小组Leader共同控制的多签钱包内，两个小组的Leaders对所有完成Tasks的人员进行激励分配。\n为了避免每个小组的集权化控制，每个小组需要有4-5名Leaders，并且社区Leader也会加入多签钱包内，也能完善的评估每个Task的激励额。\n开发组的Leaders：1名前端工程师，1名系统后端工程师，1名设计师，1名合约工程师。\n运营组的Leaders：2名Mod人员，1名市场人员，1名产品人员\n为了增加核心团队的工种多样性，更方便倾听和讨论社区的声音，我们对核心团队做了以下规划：\n\n核心团队成员的代币持仓需要大于等于300万枚，并且钱包需要公示，和社区利益牢牢绑定。\n核心团队的工种扩充，增加1名Mod Leader ，1名产品Leader和1名市场Leader，从社区里面进行竞选。\n核心团队剔除两名开发人员，增加运营小组在社区的话语权。\n按照以上的规划，社区代币的释放速度，一年会低于16%以内，最低在8%一年的释放速度，也能保障所有的投资者和社区贡献者。",

Therefore the community requested **9 ETH** from the treasury to be used as an Alpha investment principal based on Panda Media.\n\nThe Core team will select 15 people (non-core members) from the Panda Media auditor team and divide them into 3 teams with three multi-signature wallets. The multi-signature wallets run by 5 people will be invested with a minimum of 3 signatures to make it work, and each person will need to credit 0.2 ETH as principal to the multi-signature wallets too. During the operation period, funds cannot be transferred out of the multi-signature wallet.\n\nAll profits they make will be divided equally among the five individuals.\n\n1. Time period: 3 months\n2. When the profit exceeds 2x of the principal, the VC team needs to repay the principal to the community treasury and end the experiment.\n3. If loss occurs, the community and the five members's principal will share the loss in proportion to their investment.\n\nWe hope to be able to test the products developed by the community through the above tests and to be well prepared for any future investment by the community. \n",

      "content": "In the past two days, PandaDAO has got a lot of money. And there are some different voices in the community. We have always been willing to work with all communities with an open and cooperative mind, but we will always put the voice and vote of our own community first.\nWe don't want everyone to invest in PandaDAO with FOMO mentality. We want you to know what kind of products we are building and how we will use the funds we raise, and we have written all the details in the In the white paper, I hope you can read it again.\n**So we propose to open a 7-day refund window for friends who have invested in PandaDAO without rational consideration.**\n\nDetails\n1. During the refund time, everyone is free to choose whether to quit or stay (but sorry, we can't help you to bear the gas fee)\n\n2. If you want to choose a refund, please do not sell and transfer your tokens to avoid refund failure.\n\n3. Due to JuiceBox's handling fee mechanism, a small portion of your refund will be returned in $JBX (within 5%)\n\n4. During the refund period, the tokens in the treasury assets will not be distributed or moved, and the same amount of tokens will be destroyed and refunded.\n\n5. For the refund contract, the community needs to select 1 contract engineer, 1 front-end engineer, and 1 UI engineer. The cumulative development time is 7 days, and the development will be launched after the test is completed.\n\n6. Because of the opening of the refund, the token will be deflated, so we cannot determine the share of the LP pool. In order to protect all investors and other Token holders who have not refunded, and avoid malicious shorting of the treasury funds, the LP pool will will cancel.\n\nIn the end, we sincerely remind you\n1. PandaDAO is fundraising, not donation.\n2. We are not meme coins, we are a community for web3 products\n3. We will use and spend the funds you choose to invest in an open and transparent manner according to the white paper and community voting.\n4. Investment is risky, and you need to be cautious when entering the market\n\n\n\n\nPandaDAO在最近的两天当中，涌入了很多资金。而社区也出现了一些不一样的声音。我们一直愿意以开放合作的心态去和所有社区合作，但我们会把我们自己社区的声音和投票永远放在第一位。\n我们并不希望大家以fomo的心态来投资PandaDAO，我们希望您在选择的时候，知道我们在做什么样的产品，我们将会怎么使用我们筹集到的资金，而所有的细节我们都写在了白皮书当中，希望您能够再阅读一遍。\n\n**所以我们在这里提案，社区将为没有理性考虑清楚就投资了PandaDAO的朋友们开放为期7天的退款窗口。**\n\n细节\n1. 在退款窗口时间中，所有人可以自由选择是退出还是留下（不过很抱歉，额外的gas费我们没有办法帮您承担）\n\n2. 如果您要选择退款，请勿出售和转移您的代币，避免退款失败。\n\n3. 因为JuiceBox的手续费机制的原因，您的退款将有少部分比例以$JBX返还 （5%以内）\n\n4. 在退款期间内，国库资产内的Token不做任何分发和激励操作，并且销毁和退款同等量的Token。\n\n5. 针对退款合约，社区需要抽出1名合约工程师，1名前端工程师，1名UI工程师，累计开发工时7 天，开发完成测试后将上线。\n\n6. 因为退款的开启，代币会进行通缩，所以我们无法确定LP池的份额，也为了保护所有没有退款的投资者和其它Token持有人，避免有人恶意做空国库资金，LP池将会取消。\n\n最后，我们真心的提醒您\n1. PandaDAO是筹资，不是捐款。\n2. 我们不是meme币，我们是做web3产品的社区\n3. 您选择投入的资金，我们都会按照白皮书和社区投票，进行公开透明的使用和花费\n4. 投资有风险，入市需谨慎 ",

      "content": "PandaDAO融资结束时间早于Cult.DAO提案结束时间的处理方案\n\n\n### Background \nPandaDAO mentioned in the white paper and community proposal [Funding Cycle Modification](https://snapshot.org/#/panda-dao.eth/proposal/0xc102cf1776955416c279338e2d293886b720f27f94a2a73c171017faafd0b698)\nIf the funding amount touches 500 ETH, the funding will be closed within 24 hours. \n\n\n### Proposal \nAnd PandaDAO reached its planned funding of 500ETH on JuiceBox on **2022.04.04 08:57:00 UTC+8**\nSo according to the community vote, **the funding will end on 2022.04.05 08:57:00 UTC+8** \nAnd the end of voting for Cult.DAO is **2022.04.07** \n\n<br/>\n\nAnd this round of funding Cult.DAO gave a lot of support and help to PandaDAO, and Cult.DAO is also the first VC to publicly support PandaDAO. Cult.DAO's proposal : [PandaDAO Proposal for Cult.DAO](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fEPjZbiqQ7vJJ7JVnthq39Sk5bRyZ5tKtsjMS-ELiHI/edit#heading=h.xch20u28w5hf)\n<br/>\nTherefore, after discussion, we would like to initiate a proposal to reserve 13ETH of funding for Cult.DAO and we will Mint out 13ETH worth of tokens in advance before the end of JuiceBox's funding cycle.\n1. If the investment proposal for Cult.Dao is approved by vote, we will proceed with the investment proposal's plan\n2. If Cult.DAO's investment proposal is not approved, we will destroy the 13 ETH worth of tokens by putting them into a black hole. \n\n\n### 背景\nPandaDAO在白皮书与社区提案当中提到，\n[Funding Cycle Modification](https://snapshot.org/#/panda-dao.eth/proposal/0xc102cf1776955416c279338e2d293886b720f27f94a2a73c171017faafd0b698)\n如果融资金额触及 500ETH，将会在24小时内结束融资。 <br/>\n\n### 提案\n而PandaDAO于 **2022.04.04 08:57:00 UTC+8** 在JuiceBox上的融资金额达到计划的500ETH <br/>\n所以按照社区投票内容，**将于 2022.04.05 08:57:00 UTC+8** 结束融资 <br/>\n而Cult.DAO的投票结束时间是 **2022.04.07**  <br>\n\n而本轮融资Cult.DAO给予了PandaDAO很大的支持与帮助，而Cult.DAO也是第一个公开支持PandaDAO的VC。Cult.DAO的提案内容为: [PandaDAO Proposal for Cult.DAO](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fEPjZbiqQ7vJJ7JVnthq39Sk5bRyZ5tKtsjMS-ELiHI/edit#heading=h.xch20u28w5hf) \n所以，经过商讨，我们希望发起提案，为Cult.DAO预留13ETH的融资额度，在JuiceBox的融资周期结束之前，我们会提前Mint出来价值13ETH的代币。\n1. 如果Cult.DAO的投资提案投票通过，我们则会按照投资提案继续执行\n2. 如果Cult.DAO的投资提案投票未通过，我们则会将这价值13ETH的代币打入黑洞进行销毁。 \n",
