As a reminder, the goals of the curation board are to promote generative artwork, promote the DAO, and contribute to the treasury.\n\nWe have been working diligently toward excellent art releases in both November and December with well-known artists (Proof and AB). As always, we are prudent with costs, aim to maximize the impact of our spending, and seek to generate a return on investment (i.e., receive income from royalties that exceeds our investment). We achieved success in our last drop, generating a surplus of ~4.5 ETH.\n\nThe budget includes costs for project management, technical administration, live events, event management, marketing and promotion, front-end development, and a small contingency for unexpected expenses. Additionally, for these and future releases, we are allocating funds in the budget to mint one or, ideally, two pieces for the treasury DAO.\n\nFor the upcoming two drops, the curation board is seeking a total of 14.45 ETH, broken down as follows:\n\n4.10 ETH for the fall release\n9.00 ETH for the winter release plus an ambitious live event\n1.35 ETH for DAO acquisitions (2 mints from each release)\n\nOur projected revenue is in excess of 21ETH on the 14.45ETH allocation/ investment. \n\nIf anyone would like to see a detailed budget, please let us know. We also intend to provide a full accounting of revenues, expenses, and profit/loss following each release.\n\nThe name of the first artist will be revealed soon, and we are confident you will be as excited about the upcoming releases as we are.",

      "content": "One of the inherent challenges of a decentralized environment is achieving concrete results without clear leadership.  However, our DAO is not just another decentralized community.  We boast a membership of accomplished artists, investors, and professionals, all of whom are deeply committed to our collective success.\n\nRecognizing the need for a proactive approach, we're thrilled to nominate sssluke for the role of Artistic Director.  He's not only been instrumental in promoting our DAO but has also woven it into the very fabric of the digital art space.  His recent collaboration in organizing a Grailers-branded show with Unit London is a testament to his capabilities, especially since it predominantly featured artists from our community.\n\nGiven sssluke's professional background as an Art Project Manager — where he excels in negotiating with artists and setting up infrastructure — he emerges as the ideal candidate to lead our endeavors.\n\nAs a testimony to our confidence in his abilities and to maintain transparency with our community, sssluke's compensation will not follow the traditional salaried approach.  Instead, he will be compensated on a per-project basis, aligned with the revenue and exposure each project achieves.  His term will commence from the end of this snapshot vote, extending till the end of 2024, providing him with ample opportunity to manifest his vision for our community.",

Additionally, this proposal will enable sharing of the art via Twitter at the time of conversion to promote the art and grailers. This will bring attention to the DAO and Stefano. Further, it will encourage existing members who are still on the grailers legacy token to convert their pass for the art pass on our new contract. \n\nSteps: Develop front end UI and contract updates to allow for token owners to toggle the current state of their NFT to full art display or G overlay. Develop sharing mechanism for social at the time of conversion.\n\nBudget Request : Up to 2 eth allocation for development effort",

Unlike the government, we intend to minimize expenses and deliver under budget and return as much ETH as possible to the treasury. \n\n———\n\nThe goals of the Curation Board are to promote generative artwork, promote the DAO, and contribute to the treasury.  We have been working diligently toward an excellent art release in August.\n\n Among other things, the board has:\n\n-Selected an outstanding artist for the upcoming release and secured an agreement with ArtBlocks to provide the technology. \n\n-Curated artists for an October online exhibition in partnership with a top IRL gallery that will result in exposure for the DAO and revenue for the treasury.\n\n-Planned an evening presentation at a large group generative art show at a different gallery at no cost to the DAO.\n\nThe Curation Board has been operating lean and bootstrapping where possible.  We are now at a point where an infusion of capital is needed.  We view this as an investment in future revenue from the upcoming release and exhibition sales.  We will try to be under budget and return any unused ETH to the treasury. \n\nThe Curation Board is requesting 8.5 ETH allocated as follows:\n\nAugust art release:\n1.5 ETH For technical work on the Grailers website front end (expected to be lower for future releases).\n1.0 ETH for the oversight of the curation board chair.\n\nArt exhibition and sale:\n3.0 ETH for a marketing video that would also promote the DAO and other forms of promotion.\n2.5 ETH for the management work of the project lead.\n\nExtra:\n0.5 ETH for unforeseen expenses.\n\nThe board expects to raise:\n~7.0 ETH for the primary sales of the August art release plus secondary sales revenue.\n1.5 - 3.0 ETH (perhaps quite a bit higher) from the October art exhibition and sale. \n\nWe are not at liberty to divulge the name of the artist or the galleries yet, but are confident you will be impressed.",

(Could end up with a non floor)\nB - Buy a Premium RInger\nC - Do a DAO vote on collections and pick the top 5 dao voted collections and starting WETHing\n\nNOTE - Voting for option C requires a DAO member(s) to buy on behalf of the DAO.  It would require trust and discretion to bid on behalf of the DAO.   If option C is passed, a 2nd vote will be held to determine the collections and that process.  \n\nContinue discussing in the discord forum link below. ",

Exact amount will depend on exact quotes for printing and framing ICs and the price of ETH when we convert...) is to fund printing and framing of our best ICs and a 1eth budget for a LA based Grailer(s) to help with the event.\n\nTime:  We (Grailers) would take over the Vellum venue the last week of June.\n\nDescription: This is a partnership with GEN.ART, CDM, & 6529.  We are taking over the Vellum Gallery for the month of June, with Grailers' getting it the last week of June.  For our week, we'd show framed ICs and also show digital pieces from Grailers' personal collections on the remaining 10 screens.  The Curation Board recommended printing at least: #90, #93, #43, #47.  The exact number will depend on the cost to print, frame, and ship; we'll keep it around the 8eth budget, and the final list will be decided by the Curation Board.  These ICs will be official prints from Tyler, signed and numbered in their respective numbered series.  Tyler is not counting these prints against our printed allocation for the year.  Thank you!\n\nMore details on the event and potential partnership here: https://discord.com/channels/899424740131889172/973565492985999370/974348338201788416\n\nThe vote is to support allocating budget to print and frame some of our ICs for this and future events.  If the vote does not pass, we’ll still participate in the event, but will not showcase printed ICs (we’ll only show digital pieces on the screens).  If the vote passes, we’ll print and frame atleast the four ICs (#90, #93, #43, #47) and show them at the event and they’ll be available for future events as well.\n\nLonger term, we would be able to show these ICs in other venues.  Would be awesome for this to become a traveling show to help educate about ICs in their best form (printed).  First steps... ",

      "content": "Context\n\nRecently, the Grailers Season 1 Buying Committee was formed by DAO vote*. This committee is tasked with brainstorming potential new acquisitions post-Incomplete Control and is in charge of following through on making these acquisitions once the DAO backs the suggestion(s) provided by the committee. The committee is bringing the first acquisition proposal to the DAO for a vote.\n\nCommittee members include proper, 0xgav, Birdman, mathewzilla.eth, Bob Loukas, and confusedcollector.\n\n\n\nProposal\n\nRecently, works by multiple well-known generative artists have either been put up for sale or will be going up for auction in the immediate future. The buying committee has identified at least one of these pieces that we feel is both work by an iconic artist and strengthens Grailers’ brand as champions of generative art. \n\nDue to the competitive nature of acquiring these pieces, the buying committee would like to refrain from publicly mentioning the specific work we would be going after to prevent third parties from frontrunning us should this vote pass. Rest assured that the art is by a legendary artist in the space and we feel it would be a borderline necessary addition to the Grailers collection to own work by this artist. \n\nThe buying committee is asking for the DAO to allocate no more than 50 ETH for us to attempt to acquire 1 or more works by legendary generative artists. The committee will handle the logistics of acquiring the work and the announcement of the piece will happen after the fact should a) this vote pass, and then b) the committee successfully acquires the work.\n\nVote Options:\n\nYes - Allocate no more than 50 ETH for the buying committee to attempt to acquire work by the artist in question\n\nNo - Do not support and the buying committee goes back to brainstorming other potential acquisitions for the DAO\n\n\n* https://snapshot.org/#/grailers.eth/proposal/0xd22a150e4cbd0ef903e220fcd4a9ea6b45892506d10aac97d7e4006ff7b5422d\n",

      "title": "Buy more grails (season 1)",
      "content": "We love the grails.  We want more grails.  We need to get back into the business buying art.  It is a key part of our mission!  The things that worked very well for us during the IC buying period where as follows:\n- We had a clear charter - buy as many ICs as we can.\n- We had a clear budget - use all the treasury we had from minting\n- We allowed a small team to execute against this charter with enough autonomy to move quickly.\n\nLet’s take a similar approach with the introduction of “buying seasons”.  We will elect a small team to execute against a buying charter that is:\n- pre-approved by a DAO vote\n- narrow in scope with clearly defined boundaries\n- time-bound\n- within a DAO voted budget envelope\nFor more details on the conversation that lead to this proposal see #prop34-buying-more-gails\n\nThe specific proposal here would be as follows:\nEvery buying season (say, every 4 months), we vote on the following as it related to that specific buying season:\n- Elect a buying committee of 6 people to make the specific decisions on what to buy and hustle to get the best deals within the charter agreed upon above.\n- A budget for that buying season \n- Define a charter - We will take proposals from DAO members, then vote on them to pick one charter for that season.\n\nThis proposal is to vote on the process outlined above.  If the vote passes, we’ll have 3 more votes to kick off Season 1. \n1) Elect the committee.  The committee will propose a budget and a few options for our charter.  We’ll then vote on these two things.\n2) Set a budget through a vote.  The committee will propose options.\n3) Define the charter.  The committee will come up with a few proposals and we’ll vote to decide which one to pursue.  The committee will then execute the charter over the next 4 months.\n\nF.A.Q\n\nWhat is an example of a charter for a buying season? (these are just examples, we aren't voting on the chart just yet)\n“I think one charter should be buying a top tier piece from each ArtBlocks curated drop and then select playgrounds.  If we do our research pre drop, you can buy a top 20 curated piece for 5 to 10th right after mint. It won’t cost a fortune, we will always have top tier pieces from each collection, and we are committed to the art blocks community.”\nBob Loukas\n“build a legit world class FX Hash collection”\nmathewzilla.eth\n",

      "content": "BACKGROUND\nThe existing GrailersDAO NFT has a smart contract token approval bug that prevents it from being used in dApps such as LooksRare and Sudoswap. As such, we plan to use the opportunity with Stefano Contiero's artwork launch to migrate to a new contract. There are pros and cons in how this is conducted as outlined below. Your community input will be valuable in helping us make the right decision.\n\nOPTION A: Trade-in Existing NFTs for new NFTs\n+ Typically a standard approach as there will only be 1 set of NFTs in circulation and no risk of invalid purchases of old NFTs\n- Token approval bug means that approval is required for each token\n- For multiple holders, this can be arduous and will cost gas\n- May need to chase up people as requires active engagement\n\nOPTION B: Airdrop/transfer new NFTs to existing holders\n+ Gasless and smoother experience (not required to approve tokens one by one)\n+ Members are issued NFTs automatically without requiring their action\n- Risk of invalid trades of void NFTs if communication not effective\n- DAO treasury to incur gas costs to mint and airdrop NFTs\n\nOPTION C: Change cover art of existing NFTs \n+ Simple to do, no new smart contracts needed \n- Will need to live with the bug as outlined in Background",

Remove the “core team” royalties and have these go to GrailersDAO treasury going forward\n- Grailers is not run by a “core team” or a set of “multi-sigs”, it is and should be run by the DAO members so we should do away with titles that may confuse members that there is centralization. \nWir receives 4 Grailers – Birdman 3 Grailers and Stefano receives 2 Grailer in exchange for foregoing future royalties and for their past contributions in getting the DAO to where it is today.  These reflect the ratios of current payouts.\n\n2nd ACTION - \n\nHold a new election for all 7 multi-sig seats and once every 12-month elections.\n\n-  Currently the 7 multi-sigs are: 1) ConfusedCollector, 2) Wir, 3) Matthewzilla, 4) 0xGav, 5) SimonSays, 6) Proper, 7) ben.eth.  4 of 7 signers are required to approve any transaction.  The election was a discord election before we had snapshot up and running so it’s a good time now to hold another one.  \n\n- 5 day nomination window followed by a 5 day vote of all nominated.  We can start a separate channel for nominations.\n\n- Each new multi-sig elected (that’s not currently a multi-sig if any are re-elected) will receive 1.5 ETH for their service and to cover their signing gas costs.\n\n- Multi-sigs should simply be an administrative function and should serve to approve transactions for the DAO treasury wallet only as directed by DAO votes.\n\nOn the anniversary, we will hold new nominations and elections. \n \n",

      "title": "Allocate 10 Grailers to onboard Generative Artists",
      "content": "Background:\nWe’ve built an incredible community of collectors, artists, developers, builders, doers, thought leaders, and degen alpha-seekers.\nWhere do we go from here?  We all appreciate some fine generative art and want to acquire more grails.  How do we grow the treasury / DAO value in other ways beyond just selling the limited number of remaining Grailers NFTs?\n\nThere are several exciting initiatives the community is working on (discussed further in discord) including a generative art mint platform, a podcast, and others.  These are just representative examples of the types of things the Grailers community can do together.  Our 181 remaining Grailers will eventually run out so I’m hopeful we’ll use some of those remaining to build a lasting community of artists and doers where the value of the Grailers community far exceeds the value we would’ve otherwise achieved by simply selling Grailers NFTs to the highest bidder.  Think an FWB for generative art that also collects grails.\n\nWith this vision in mind, we would like to onboard select, high quality generative artists to GrailersDAO.  Having some of our favorite generative artists as part of the Grailers community and helping us shape the future of the DAO will be beneficial.\n\nProposal: (Note: The below is the only proposal; the above is just background on why we're putting forth this proposal)\nAllocate 10 Grailers (for now) for the Grailers team members to award to select, quality generative artists to onboard them to GrailersDAO.  The only thing we’d ask is for them to confirm their interest in being an active participant in the DAO.",

      "content": "We have the chance to secure our 9th (and likely final) Incomplete Control and we need to accelerate fundraising to both pay off our 8th IC and secure the 9th IC.  This proposal is to open the following two mints (in order):\n1) A Grailers only discounted mint for a short window of time (like 48 hours) for 1.8eth\n2) Open a “volume discount” mint for anyone who buys 5 (2eth/grailer) or 10 (1.8eth/grailer) grailers.\n\nDuring (1), non-grailers can still mint at 2.25.  To make this easy to implement, for both (1) and (2) you will have to pay 2.25eth to mint and the treasury will refund the difference.  It’s too hard to implement otherwise.  If any grailers bought from the current mint already, they will be refunded the difference.\n\nWe will release a form to process the discount refunds in which applicants will need to provide their Etherscan transaction.\n",

This proposal is to give the GrailersDAO multi-sigs discretion to use up to all of the available Grailers DAO Treasury to purchase Incomplete Control Golden Tokens (or ICGT Options).  This discretion would run from 9am Eastern on Nov 5 to 9am Eastern on Nov 12.  This discretion would not allow paying more than 60 ETH per Incomplete Control Golden Token or more than 45 ETH per ICGT Option.  Our target price is much lower than that and the multi-sigs may in their discretion decide not to purchase at these prices, even if ICs/Options are available.  This simply gives the multi-sigs discretion to act given we'll need to buy able to purchase quickly off secondary when good deals pop up and holding votes for each purchase would not be feasible.",
