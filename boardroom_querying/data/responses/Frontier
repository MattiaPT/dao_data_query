      "content": "The current configuration of the Frontier [Vote](https://vote.frontier.xyz/) portal stipulates that [$FRONT](https://etherscan.io/token/0xf8C3527CC04340b208C854E985240c02F7B7793f) holders must hold at least 1000 tokens within their wallets to be considered community members that can participate in voting (see [this commit](https://github.com/snapshot-labs/snapshot-spaces/commit/6fbf4681cc0f0ee082d9624b301a8fb33f85375b)). Additionally, those who provide liquidity to either Uniswap or Balancer are also counted (see the strategies available [here](https://docs.snapshot.page/strategies)).\n\nThe rationale for 1000 $FRONT is as follows:\n\n1. Current spot rate of $FRONT on the market is approximately .24 USDT. 1000 tokens, therefore, is 240 USDT and not (subjective) a large barrier to entry into Frontier community decisionmaking.\n2. The top ~450 wallets for $FRONT all hold more than 1000 tokens, give or take a few wallets at the time of writing. \n3. Higher threshold on token count means that someone who is signaling a vote has a vested interest in what we are attempting to accomplish at [Frontier](https://frontier.xyz/).\n\nThere are downsides to this approach, to be sure: \n\n1. If the [spot price](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/frontier) of $FRONT rises drastically, then the barrier of entry to becoming a Frontier voter goes down.\n2. 240 USDT is not a small sum of money in some parts of the world.\n3. Some may argue that holding 1 $FRONT should be enough to hold a vote in our community. \n\nThese are valid concerns. While we work on building out our roadmap for community development (Discord channel, long-form discussion forum, etc.), we should conclude on a minimum $FRONT per wallet count for non-trivial decisions about proposals that Core members accept or propose. \n\nDo note that this voting portal, while currently open to any $FRONT holder with a wallet balance greater than 1000, is not \"vote passes; therefore, an implementation will happen\". This is an experiment in community building that we are attempting to handle with voting, long-form discussion, and a mix of chats.\n\n**How many $FRONT held should be accepted into community voting?**\n\nVote below. Voting ends approximately one week from today. $FRONT held at block [11290000](https://etherscan.io/block/countdown/11290000) snapshot will be counted.",
