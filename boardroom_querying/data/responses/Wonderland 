      "title": "[CMP #14] Snapshot Threshold Adjustment",
      "content": "Objective:\nThis proposal aims to change the percentage required for a holder to post a CMP directly to Snapshot from 1% to 5% of the circulating supply.\n\nHigh Level Details:\nWhen the management team implemented CMPs in April 2023, it was an important step towards ensuring that members are able to present their ideas and ultimately gather support from big holders to create community proposals. The process enabled ideas to be heard, discussed, refined and ultimately posted to a snapshot vote with either a single holder or combined holders’ tokens.\n\nAn initial minimum of 1% of the then-circulating supply of wMEMO (equaling 336 wMEMO or 11,100 Volta) was required to post proposals on Snapshot and create a valid vote. The obvious purpose of the minimum threshold was to encourage discussion and prevent the spam of new votes as well as prevent governance attacks. Due to the massive decline in circulating supply after the migration period ended, the required Volta for direct snapshot posts\nis currently at approximately 2,300 tokens. While it opens up the amount of holders that can sponsor votes, it undermines the original idea behind the minimum.\n\nSince the minimum drastically dropped, we have seen an increase in votes going directly to Snapshot that seem to make no sense or relevance. Several votes were posted multiple times with little changes under x.1, x.2, x.3. It is important that holders can participate with ideas and proposals as well as vote on impactful decisions. Keeping updated and following announcements about votes on Discord usernames or repetitive votes should not be burdening\nholders who want to participate in governance.\n\nLow Level Details:\nWith this proposal, the 1% is to be raised to 5%, effective immediately after the passing of this vote. The proposed 5% currently equals approximately 11,700 Volta, similar to the amount required at the implementation of CMPs. It will naturally decline over time due to the reduction of supply via buybacks as originally intended.\n\nCMP article:\nhttps://medium.com/volta-newsletter/empowering-community-decision-making-wonderland-dao-i\nntroduces-community-member-proposals-25be610afbd8",

      "title": "[WMP #1] - End Redemptions",
      "content": "## Scope\nDiscontinue the redemption process.\n\n## Objective\nThis proposal aims to end our quarterly redemption system and utilize our simplified more profitable method of buybacks and controlled liquidity to ensure market price stability.\n\n## Proposal\nIn a prior vote, we created a management team and ensured the long-term stability of the protocol's core. The redemption procedure has become an obsolete method. In periods of uncertain management, it was established to guarantee exit liquidity. For a better outcome, we can leverage our new V3-like LPs on Kyberswap in combination with coordinated buybacks. We are always able to assure that the market price of wMEMO will trade in close proximity to its liquid backing.\n\nThe Treasury team has been able to concentrate liquidity in a manner that is favorable for the Treasury since the establishment of our LP on Kyberswap as a result of our strategic buybacks.  We have the opportunity to use this system which results in more profit for long-term holders.  We have been able to provide the same or better exit levels as during our quarterly redemption periods. The system is transparent and is available at all times to anyone wishing to exit.  It also maintains our wMEMO supply at the current level.\n\nThe current system protects redeemers with large positions from slippage.  It does not benefit the protocol nor its remaining holders.  It comes at a direct cost to holders as the whitelisted funds need to be swapped and moved.  Funds are not being allocated to return yield for at least as long as the redemption is active.\n\nWonderland adopted quarterly redemptions mostly owing to the unpredictability of past management and the frequent trading of wMEMO below its backing price. During that moment, Wonderland was unable to guarantee an exit at a reasonable price other than by issuing these redemptions. With the management transition this is no longer a problem. Treasury buybacks under backing price are lucrative, which is advantageous for all remaining holders, hence buybacks were decided to be the most effective alternative. The market price remains organically close to the backing price, allowing holders to sell anytime they choose without having to wait until the following quarter or be whitelisted. No lengthy or complicated procedures are involved. Exiting will need a straightforward DEX swap with fair value depending on the present backing price. It is a fluid system with no adverse consequences on holders, such as the freezing of funds or the temporary liquidation of holdings required for redemptions.\n\nRedemption can be a complex process for some.  It will be helpful to simplify the method used to maintain price stability.  Those following the simple \"stake and hold\" approach will earn higher returns.  It is our duty to look out for the vast majority of holders who expect us to manage this app well without their own constant micromanagement.",

He has experience with multisigs as well and has no role in Wonderland or any affiliation with other protocols. \n\nBoth are able to read and verify the needed information, are diligent and active daily.

      "title": "[WIP #32] - Wonderland DAO Amendment",
      "content": "## Scope\nThe scope of this proposal is to turn Wonderland into an organization that serves its token holders. This will be done by improving security, ensuring stability, and allowing flexibility, by creating a team of officers empowered to handle day-to-day operations with less friction.\n* Streamlines DAO governance processes to be more efficient.\n* Empowers elected officers to make decisions within their departments.\n* Establishes the Wonderland management budget.\n## Objective\nThis proposal takes into consideration legal advice and maintains stability and security. This proposal seeks to reduce governance inefficiencies that cost holders both in opportunities and profits. It will reduce attack vectors on governance that may occur, and empower an elected team to make decisions with reduced friction. It assures flexibility and responsiveness in a space where these traits are paramount.\n## Purpose\nThe purpose of this proposal is not to abolish everything the DAO has created over the past year. In fact, the opposite is true. It is the result of a deep desire to protect what Wonderland has achieved and created that led to the formulation of this proposal.\n\nAs there is much work to be done and the security and procedure of our existing governance and investment systems are compromised, Wonderland cannot afford to pause the DAO this way and engage in months-long discussions to address every miniscule detail. Instead, we can proceed with what is proposed here, being more knowledgeable this time around, and build on this revised structure.\n\nPointing out and discussing security flaws that may imminently cause a governance attack without addressing them in the same proposal is unwise. The elected team would be remiss if we delayed the protocol’s process as a precaution until the DAO reaches an agreement on all aspects of its management.\n\nIn addition to the existing team, the DAO is presented with the possibility to add a significant boost of insight and advice to ensure the protocol’s success by including one of Wonderland’s founders, Sifu, who has extensive experience with TradeFi, DeFi, hedge funds and professional contracts. Acquiring a team member with his advanced level of expertise is essential in ensuring the ongoing success of Wonderland.\n## High Level Overview\nThe following proposal was crafted after a series of in-depth discussions with legal firms around the world, which led to the realization that we have failed our holders by losing focus on the main objective of the protocol: profits for holders.\n\nAs a result of Wonderland’s abstract management, there is a high risk of malicious actors carrying out governance attacks in an effort to totalize the system. Protocol stability is negatively impacted directly by this, since these actors may accumulate voting power for a brief period of time and promote their own agendas in specific aspects of Wonderland’s day-to-day operations.\n\nMoreover, Wonderland has been subjected to long, frequent, and inefficient governance procedures, which are susceptible to manipulation. Though the team has always focused on the community and how to serve it better, unintentionally it has resulted in a system that focuses and abides by the loudest people, not the clear majority of silent “stake and chill” token holders. A long and time-consuming governance system, that promotes mob participation rather than a power by shares or delegation in Wonderland, which is host to constant conflict and disagreement between people who, estimated on votes, collectively hold a very small percentage of the shares.\n\nFurthermore, our Treasury cannot respond quickly to the fast changing market conditions, which is essential in this industry, thereby damaging its performance and putting investor value at risk. Examples from the last quarter illustrate how Treasury delays lead to big financial losses:\n#### Example I\nUwU Lend, which was one of the most controversial proposals and had to be voted on three times, resulting in Wonderland losing an average of ~$4,000 per day for every day the proposal was delayed. The Treasury Council decided to lock UwU on 8th of November and the final approval arrived on 8th of December resulting in an approximate amount of $120,000 in damages. This directly affects the liquid backing as the yield is considered liquid for the redemption price. Aside from the daily damages, the exposure of this proposal was significant and led to frontrunning. The original proposal for the lock-in UwU LP was drafted with Wonderland at the time looking at around 300% APY returns on investment. However, once the TMP actually passed, a month later, Wonderland was looking at around 150% APY return on investment prior to the lock.\n#### Example II\nAs part of Interport seed phase presale investment, Wonderland intended to invest $1,500,000 for 7,500,000 ITP at $0.2 per token. Upon approval of the proposal, Interport’s presale had already concluded and the price had changed to $0.3 per token. Ultimately, Wonderland acquired 5,000,000 ITP, resulting in an overall loss of 2,500,000 ITP, or $2,800,000 at the current valuation.\n#### Example III\nThe Swapfish investment was among the TOs’ alpha findings. However, yields dropped by over 75% during the delay. Both the alpha and Wonderland’s intention to join were announced to anyone interested. This gave others several days of yield that should have benefitted Wonderland’s holders.\n\nSeveral other positions were canceled or modified as the TMP caused frontrunning and valuable time was lost. Some strategies were never proposed, as they cannot efficiently be implemented with these processes.\n\nWonderland’s Treasury has been threatened by lengthy procedures and frontrunning opportunities that the protocol provides by informing the public space in advance of Wonderland’s investments. This tactic would be considered outrageous and unacceptable by any experienced investor. It is common for frontrunners to pay for access to such information, whereas Wonderland leaks it for free via the TMP system, confusing strategic information censorship with transparency.\n\nIt is prudent to establish a successful corporate management structure for Wonderland in order to ensure long-term stability, security, and flexibility. It will help the protocol to reach its full potential and maximize profit for holders. Corporate management structures have been developed through decades of experience and billions of dollars of investment, and have been found to be an optimal structure by regulatory agencies and think tanks around the world.\n\nFor the protocol to be successful, secure, and stable, it is essential to have a strong leadership team with decision-making authority. In the midst of a bear market where opportunities are limited, now is the time to take action and evolve to prevent further losses caused by our systematically flawed structure and establish a proven working system to achieve the wants of the vast majority: security, efficiency, stability, performance, and profit.\n\nThis year, a number of individuals from the community emerged to lead the internal process and maintain the protocol’s integrity and vision.\n\nIt is imperative to give the team the opportunity to continue with greater efficiency what they have been doing for the past year, despite their limited access. A better management system is one that aligns with real-world trends and lessons learned, rather than reinventing the wheel. The DAO should be responsible for setting the general direction of the organization, while management should be responsible for its day-to-day operations.\n## Low Level Details\nA six-department structure was designed based on Wonderland's current operations to avoid the danger of testing an unfamiliar system which could lead to negative results.\n* Communication\n* Compliance\n* Finance\n* Operations\n* Technology\n* Visionary\n### Departments Overview\n#### Communication\n@AliceInWonderland\nThe voice of Wonderland. Communications, social media, monthly Medium articles and community platforms are the scope of this department and serves as a meeting point between the various departments and the community at large.\n#### Compliance\n@NalX\nThe Compliance Department should provide advice and assistance to all managerial posts with regard to compliance with all relevant laws, regulation, and DAO rules.\n#### Finance\n@ruian\nOversee all Treasury-related activities. Responsible for the preparation of quarterly performance reports for the holders, oversight of the Treasury operations and its budget, community proposals, risk management, and approval of strategies.\n#### Operations\n@Bamchicka\nEnsure that the information is accurate, the structure is appropriate, the internal organization is effective, and that legal advice is followed in cooperation with the Compliance Department. In addition to ensuring Wonderland’s internal operations are efficient, the Operations Department will provide the rest of the departments with solutions to increase day-to-day efficiency. The Operations Department also serves as the Protocol’s information bank.\n#### Technology\n@Catalyst\nEnsure that the protocol’s technical components meet industry standards. Assurance that all technical operations are functional and properly managed. Ensure that technological resources are geared towards technological advancement and all technical improvements and suggestions are implemented in a timely manner.\n#### Visionary\n@0xSifu\nAdvise all departments in order to ensure that the vision for the Protocol’s growth is implemented and provide knowledge and guidance on delicate decisions. Analyzing and providing insight into the potential risks associated with the protocol’s financial investments to help avoid making decisions that might have unintended consequences. Whenever necessary, assisting with the negotiations with third party protocols.\n### Departments Details\nThe DAO serves as the organization’s board of directors and elects officers to handle all aspects of the organization’s management. Token holders are provided with close communication daily through Wonderland’s social platforms and discord channels, or they can opt to follow the quarterly treasury summary and market outlook and regular news articles instead. Establishing this structure will be beneficial for future restrictions and regulations as it closely resembles existing real-world corporate structures.\n\nIn order for the Protocol to fulfill its strategic mission, the Team is responsible to collectively establish and publish the operational system that demonstrates how specific activities will be handled. In order to ensure frictionless workflows, secure procedures, and adhere to legal advice to prepare for any upcoming regulations, the team will implement an internal system of operations that is as close to actual fund guidelines as possible. The revised management structure explicitly sets all internal rules.\n### Executive Decisions\nThe Officers will be responsible for managing the day to day operations of the protocol. Formerly voted WIPs shall be considered as operational guidelines.\n### Removal of an Officer\n#### By the Team\nAny team member may propose the removal of another team member by internal vote with a valid reason. Majority vote is required.\n#### By the DAO\nA No-Confidence Vote (NCV) can be proposed by a DAO member as a DAO Discussion [DD], with solid reasoning, to replace any member of the team. The DAO may initiate the forum-based removal process as follows: The NCV must be posted and remain open in the Wonderland Forum for three days before voting. At the conclusion of the discussion period, a four-day Snapshot vote will be conducted requiring 75% of voters in agreement on the final decision of removing the team member. In order to prevent exploitation of the system, team members are granted immunity for three months after their election as well as two weeks of immunity after an unsuccessful NCV. During this time, only a unanimous vote of the team can remove another member.\n### Addition of an Officer\nIn the event of a team member being ousted, unable to fulfill the duties of the position for a prolonged period of time, or resigning, the team will vote for an interim replacement and an open letter will be posted in the forum. The team holds the responsibility to conduct due diligence for each application and to approve the candidacy.\n### Management Budget\nIn accordance with industry standards, legal advice, and community feedback, a 2&10 system is suggested. The management fee will be 2% per year, and the performance fee is 10% per year of profits only, with a high watermark, defined as the price difference of wMEMO between the conclusion of each quarter and the highest liquid redemption price of wMEMO since the passing of this proposal. This budget is dedicated to cover all operational costs for running the organization.\n\nOperational costs include but are not limited to team member salaries, legal expenses, marketing, payments for required personnel within departments, technological maintenance, enhancements and security, and any other expenses required for protocol management. An expense report will be published on a quarterly basis to provide transparency on how the management fee has been utilized.\n### Term of Office\nPer community suggestion, and Officers’ agreement, members of the management team will remain in their positions until they resign, the team votes them out, or the DAO replaces them via an NCV.\n### Governance Forum\nA new subcategory, Wonderland Management Proposal (WMP) will be created, replacing the RFC and WIP sections. The DAO Discussion section (DD) may be used by any member of the DAO who wishes to post an official proposal for review by the management team. Any member of the management team can edit, refine, and promote the proposal to WMP if the proposal is deemed as beneficial for the DAO and enough participation is reached. Management may use a direct WMP to obtain DAO approval for potentially contentious or highly important decisions. It should be noted that while this will be the case for major changes, this option is not mandatory for management and operational changes. The time frame for discussion phase for each WMP prior to posting a Snapshot vote will be determined dynamically by the team based on the state of emergency, the complexity, and feedback.",

      "title": "[TMP #8.1] - Purchase LUSD and Invest in Chicken Bonds",
      "content": "## Scope:\nRequest DAO approval to purchase an additional $3mm in Chicken Bonds\n\n## Current Governance Limitations:\nWIP #28:\n\n[…] the Risk Officer will now identify and share with the Treasury Council the risks associated with each strategy prior to the council’s vote […]\nA TMP is being used to assist treasury personnel with decision making by having the DAO review the proposal, assess the risks and make the final decision.\n\n## Objective:\nPurchase $3mm LUSD and deploy through Chicken Bonds.\n\n## Rationale:\nThe Wonderland Treasury still has a lot of unallocated funds and given the current market conditions there are limited opportunities. It is believed that the nature of this proposal is relatively safe and will provide decent returns while waiting for market conditions to improve.\n\nThis is a fairly straightforward stable farm strategy with relatively low risk. In the absence of a Risk Officer, the DAO is being asked to accept the risk by providing its approval.\n\n## Plan/Strategy:\nWonderland currently has roughly $7mm in Chicken Bonds deployed and Treasury Operators (TO) are seeking DAO approval to deploy an additional $3mm (for a total of $10mm).\n\nThe purchase of LUSD will be made in small amounts (e.g. $500,000 to $1mm) to minimize slippage, and timed to take advantage of price dips in LUSD.Total allocation deployment may take a few days to take advantage of dips in the price of LUSD. The LUSD will be used for depositing and creating Chicken Bonds (using Liquity.app) as LUSD is accrued.\n\n#### Example bonding yield scenario:\nWhile a Chicken Bond has no end date, it does present a few milestones (e.g. break even date & optimal rebond date). This bond could be canceled at any time to recover the initially deposited LUSD.\n\nWonderland deposits $1,000,000 LUSD to create a Chicken Bond on December 28th.\n\nBreak-even date would be Jan 24th.\n\nRebond date would be February 11th.\n\nEstimated yield would be 25.98% Max APR under current market prices assuming continuous bonding and claiming at the rebond time.\n\nAssuming an investment of $3mm and a yield of 25.98% APR , Wonderland would achieve a yield of $2136 per day.\n\nRealized yield may fluctuate based on a wide variety of factors. The Treasury Operators will monitor the positions to maximize profitability and manage risk.\n\n## Chicken Bonds Background:\nChicken Bonds is a novel bonding mechanism which allows protocols to bootstrap liquidity at minimal cost and provides better user protection than existing bonding alternatives.\n\nBonding offers an amplified yield-earning opportunity for LUSD holders. Holders can “Chicken Out” at any time, effectively canceling their bond and claiming their principal back. This makes bonding a low risk endeavor for Wonderland aside from some minimal risks (detailed below).\n\nBonding LUSD in exchange for bLUSD will offer Wonderland a boosted yield compared to depositing LUSD in the Stability Pool.\n\n- Docs/Resources: [Official Chicken Bonds Documentation - LUSD Chicken Bonds](https://docs.chickenbonds.org)\n\n## Risks/Concerns\n#### Redemption Impact\nChicken Bonds will be considered liquid as they can be redeemed at any time by “Chickening Out” to regain the original principal deposited. Therefore, there will be no impact to the redemption price.\n\n#### Sifu Vision (SV) Exposure\nSV currently has $12mm in Chicken Bond exposure. Wonderland owns roughly 60% of SV tokens, giving us an additional $7.2mm in SV exposure to Chicken Bonds.\n\n#### LUSD Price Risk/Peg Stability\nThere is some price risk as LUSD has been trading over peg for several months (currently trading at $1.03), and could peg back to $1 (or depeg under $1). The TOs believe the likelihood of LUSD depegging below $1 is very minimal due to the overcollateralization of LUSD and lack of centralization risks.\n\n#### Smart Contract Risk\nSince Chicken Bonds deposit funds to B.Protocol and the Yearn Curve LUSD vault, users implicitly assume the smart contract risk of those external protocols when using Chicken Bonds. Chicken Bonds, Liquity.app, Yearn, and B. Protocol have all undergone audits.",

      "content": "## Objective\n\nThe goal of this proposal is to modify the current multisig appointed in [[WIP #21]](https://wl-l.ink/forum/WIP/21-Multisig-Additions).\n\n- Modify the multisig members based on legal consultation.\n- Improve the multisig efficiency.\n- Previous Discussion:\n\n## High Level Details:\n\nAs a result of [WIP #28](https://wl-l.ink/forum/WIP/28/WL-Organizational-Structure) and [WIP #30](https://wl-l.ink/forum/WIP/30-Appoint-OO), five officers have been appointed to Wonderland Core Team.\n\nAs a recommendation to reduce liability on core team members, they should not hold another sensitive position to the protocol’s security.\n\nIt is also recommended that Wonderland refrains from publicly doxing the individuals participating in the multisig, as it is not a paid position and the DAO does not cover potential security issues nor the costs to limit the risks that may arise due to this role.\n\n## Provide Low Level Details:\n\nIn order to achieve the objectives above, here is what is being proposed:\n\n1. Remove @NalX from the multisig\n - Will be removed after the new signers have been added.\n2. Add two new members to the multisig\n- One neutral party and one community member with no official or unofficial role in Wonderland (e.g. officers, treasury operators, moderators).\n3. Keep the multisig requiring three signatures to execute transactions (3/6).\n- This aims at improving execution time while sacrificing limited security.\n\nThe team has already identified two additions experienced in working with a multisig. One of them has extensive knowledge that will be useful to create complex transactions when required. This is something that current signers could not always cover and had to ask the Technical Officer for assistance. Both can read and verify the needed information, are diligent and active daily. Activity times (timezone) overlap with existing signers, so establishing an organized structure with an additional member will ensure fast and frictionless execution times.\n\nBefore anyone is added to the multisig, they will be internally doxxed to the Operations Officer.\n\nThe Operations and Financial Officer will do a preliminary verification of their identities and background and make sure they are not affiliated with other protocols that would create a conflict of interest. A more thorough verification and background check will be completed by a firm hired on behalf of Wonderland.\n\nThe personal information of the signers will be encrypted and given to our legal firm, together with the decryption key, for additional security and accountability.\n\nThese changes will improve the efficiency of the multisig, which is currently sub-optimal, while adding another layer of security and keeping identities protected.\n\n## Business and/or technical requirements\n\nIf this passes, the new members will be doxxed through the process mentioned above and added to all multisig and communication channels after verification from the legal firm. Once it is done, Nal X will be removed. This process will start after onboarding with the legal company is finished and we are officially clients.",

The vast majority of aggregated swaps on Ethereum route through Curve due to their deep liquidity. They have a TVL of $3.73bn with $3.43bn of that on Ethereum.\n\n## Risks/Concerns\n\n#### Impermanent Loss\nIf pooled stables depeg it can cause an imbalance, leading to IL. Tokens that we will be exposed to in this pool are: bLUSD, LUSD, DAI, USDC, and USDT. The Treasury Team agrees that these stables and bLUSD are relatively low risk. LUSD is overcollateralized and has no centralization risks.\n\n#### Smart Contract Risk\nSmart contract, execution and exploit risk are present as usual.\n\nCurve has been audited several times:\n- https://classic.curve.fi/audits\n",

      "title": "[TMP #12] - Deploy stablecoins on Swapfish",
      "content": "## Scope:\nRequest DAO approval to deposit a mixture of stablecoins on SwapFish (Swapfish.fi)\n\n## Current Governance Limitations:\nWIP #28:\n> […] the Risk Officer will now identify and share with the Treasury Council the risks associated with each strategy prior to the council’s vote […]\n\nA TMP is being used to assist treasury personnel with decision making by having the DAO review the proposal, assess the risks and make the final decision.\n\n## Objective:\n* Deposit up to $3.5mm into a mixture of stablecoins LPs on Swapfish. Some options include the following LPs: Frax-USDC, DAI-USDC, USDT-USDC, etc.\n\n## Rationale:\nThe Wonderland Treasury still has a lot of unallocated funds and given the current market conditions there are limited opportunities. This is a fairly straightforward stable farm strategy with relatively low risk as only stablecoins will be deployed. In the absence of a Risk Officer, the DAO is being asked to accept the risk by providing its approval.\n\n## Plan/Strategy:\nThe Treasury Operators (TO) recommend depositing up to $3.5mm spread across a mixture of stablecoin LPs on SwapFish.  \n\n## Example Yield Scenario:\nSwapFish is currently paying the following yields on stablecoin LPs: Frax-USDC (17.67%), DAI-USDC (12.28%), and USDT-USDC (10.54%). Between the three LPs, the pools total roughly $17mm. A $3.5mm investment is expected to lower the yields about 20% (e.g. 20% of 14%) due to dilution of the pools. \n\nUsing a mixture of pools to minimize dilution, TOs recommend up to a $3.5mm investment with a more conservative projected average yield of roughly 10%. This would translate to a daily yield of $959, and a weekly yield of $6,713.\n\nRealized yield may fluctuate based on a wide variety of factors including changes in the price of FISH, pool sizes, and emission rates. The Treasury Operators will monitor the positions to maximize profitability and manage risk. Emissions tokens will be dumped on a regular basis.\n\n## SwapFish Background:\nSwapFish Finance is a Decentralized Exchange protocol native to the Arbitrum blockchain. With SwapFish users can trade crypto assets as well as earn trading fees and FISH tokens. \n\n- Docs/Resources: https://docs.swapfish.fi/swapfish-protocol/protocol-overview\n\n## Risks/Concerns\n\n#### Price Risk\nThe SwapFish emissions token FISH could decline in price. To mitigate this, TOs will sell/swap the FISH tokens on a regular basis as they are farmed.\n\n#### Depeg Risk\nThere is a possibility the stable coins used could suffer from a depeg where the price drops below $1.00. The stablecoins under consideration are deemed to be relatively low risk by the TOs.\n\n#### Smart Contract Risk\nSwapFish Finance has been audited by SolidProof and reviewed by RugDoc. \nhttps://docs.swapfish.fi/security/audit-kyc-and-rugdoc-review",

It is believed that the nature of this proposal is relatively safe and will provide decent returns while waiting for market conditions to improve.\nThis is a fairly straightforward stable farm strategy with relatively low risk. In the absence of a Risk Officer, the DAO is being asked to accept the risk by providing its approval.\n\n## Plan/Strategy:\nThe Treasury Operators (TO) recommend fully looping stables, vesting the rewards for four weeks (to avoid the withdrawal penalty fee), and selling the emissions tokens (RDNT) on a weekly basis. The TOs will manage which stable is used and optimize the allocation/looping as necessary to optimize yields and limit risk within the $5mm allocation limit of the TMP.\n\n## Example Looping Yield Scenario:\nRadiant Capital is currently paying a Net APY of 22.73% on 4x leveraged DAI (fully looped) and a Net APY of 38.54% on USDT on 5x leveraged USDT (fully looped). These rewards are paid in RDNT (Radiant emissions tokens). Yield on any rewards immediately sold would be cut in half due to the withdrawal penalty. Otherwise, the rewards could be vested for 4 weeks to avoid the 50% withdrawal penalty.\n\nAssuming a more conservative realized yield of 10-20% after directional price risk, WL would achieve an average daily yield of $1,369- $2,739 on a $5mm allocation.\n\nRealized yield may fluctuate based on a wide variety of factors including changes in the price of RDNT and parameter changes on Radiant Protocol. The Treasury Operators will monitor the positions to maximize profitability and manage risk. The TOs do not plan on locking into the Radiant LP (Pool2); contrary to our UwU Lend position, WL will not be “dumping on ourselves” or SifuVision by selling RDNT emissions tokens.\n\n## Radiant Capital Background:\nRadiant Protocol is a liquidity market on Arbitrum that offers depositing, borrowing, and its lending market is forked from Aave V2 (similar to UwU Lend).\n\nDocs/Resources: https://docs.radiant.capital/radiant/ (https://docs.radiant.capital/radiant/)\n\n## Risks/Concerns\n#### Redemption/Liquidity\nFor the purposes of redemption, any tokens vesting for 4 weeks will be considered illiquid. Given the anticipated yield and short vesting time frame, this should not have a significant material impact on the liquid redemption price.\n\n#### Price Risk\nRadiant Protocol’s emissions token RDNT could decline in price and farmed tokens need to be vested for 4 weeks to not incur a penalty fee. However, the price of RDNT seems to have stabilized since October as the protocol has matured.\n\n#### Depeg Risk/Liquidation Risk\nThere is a possibility the stable coins used could suffer from a depeg where the price drops below $1.00. There is also a risk for liquidation when the total Health Factor is reduced to 1.0 or lower, due to the collateral value not covering the loan/debt value. The liquidation penalty fee is 15% on Radiant Capital.\n\n#### Smart Contract Risk\nRadiant Capital has been audited by Peckshield and the report is published and publicly available.\n\nhttps://docs.radiant.capital/radiant/contracts-and-security/audits",

      "content": "## Scope:\nOffer the DAO the opportunity to sell our entire BSGG position to Betswap.\n\n## Current Governance Limitations:\nPer WIP #27:\n\n> Any seemingly valid strategy has to be properly vetted by the Risk Officer, voted by the treasury council and go through the proper governance process when applicable.\n\nWhile the proposed investment can be voted by the Treasury Council, the above guidelines cannot be followed as expected due to the current lack of Risk Officer, a TMP is being used to assist treasury personnel with decision making by having the DAO review the proposal, assess the risks and make the final decision.\n\n## Objective:\n* Sell ~1.49bn BSGG tokens for $4.47mm\n\n## Rationale:\nWonderland currently holds 1,489,539,254 BSGG tokens.  The market value of each token is $0.00274 as of this writing.  These tokens can not be sold on the open market due to lack of liquidity and are therefore not considered part of our liquid backing.\n\nBetswap has offered us the option to OTC out of our entire position at $0.003 (which is well above market price as of this writing).  This includes a sanctioned cancellation of our Sablier stream to reclaim all tokens within it.  Doing so will increase our liquid backing from approximately $28.1k to $29.2k.  This will also increase the full backing (due to above market sale) and move the treasury closer to realizing the full $131mm figure.\n\nIt is possible for Betswap to continue growth but may never be possible for us to unload our position at a fair value without an OTC due to its size.  This puts us in a position of needing to sell tokens on every Betswap price increase, and stifles their growth perpetually.  The Treasury Team agrees that accepting the offer is our best course of action, especially considering the difficult macro market conditions being experienced.  We are also unable to stake our large supply of tokens and are being diluted.\n\n## Plan/Strategy:\nWonderland has BSGG in four places.  Avalanche, Ethereum, a Sablier stream, and Sifuvision.  The Sablier stream needs to be canceled and tokens reclaimed.  Betswap is offering to forgive the vesting schedule and buy all of our tokens.  Tokens held by SifuVision in Kyberswap LPs will need to be removed for the sale.\n\nAcceptance of this proposal will grant the Treasury Team the authority to finalize and realize this deal however is reasonably needed.\n\n## Disclosure:\nSome team members and moderators have small (<$1000) positions in BSGG mainly coming from the farming rewards and airdrop.\n",

      "title": "[TMP #8] - LUSD Chicken Bond Proposal",
      "content": "## Scope:\nRequest DAO approval to purchase an additional $4.5mm in Chicken Bonds\n\n## Current Governance Limitations:\nPer WIP #27:\n\n> Any seemingly valid strategy has to be properly vetted by the Risk Officer, voted by the treasury council and go through the proper governance process when applicable.\n\nWhile the proposed investment can be voted by the Treasury Council, the above guidelines cannot be followed as expected due to the current lack of Risk Officer, a TMP is being used to assist treasury personnel with decision making by having the DAO review the proposal, assess the risks and make the final decision.\n\n## Objective:\n* Purchase $4.5mm LUSD and deploy through Chicken Bonds.\n\n## Rationale:\nThe Wonderland Treasury still has a lot of unallocated funds and given the current market conditions there are limited opportunities. It is believed that the nature of this proposal is relatively safe and will provide decent returns while waiting for market conditions to improve.\n\nThis is a fairly straightforward stable farm strategy with relatively low risk. In the absence of a Risk Officer, the DAO is being asked to accept the risk by providing its approval.\n\n## Plan/Strategy:\nWonderland currently has roughly $2.5mm in Chicken Bonds deployed and Treasury Operators (TO) are seeking DAO approval to deploy an additional $4.5mm (for a total of $7mm).\n\nThe purchase of LUSD will be made in small amounts (e.g. $500,000 to $1mm) to minimize slippage, and timed to take advantage of price dips in LUSD.Total allocation deployment may take a few days to take advantage of dips in the price of LUSD. The LUSD will be used for depositing and creating Chicken Bonds (using Liquity.app) as LUSD is accrued. \n\n#### Example bonding yield scenario:\nWhile a Chicken Bond has no end date, it does present a few milestones (e.g. break even date & optimal rebond date). This bond could be canceled at any time to recover the initially deposited LUSD.\n\nWonderland deposits $1,000,000 LUSD to create a Chicken Bond on December 5th. \nBreak-even date would be January 3rd\nRebond date would be January 23rd. \n\nEstimated yield would be 27.24% Max APR under current market prices assuming continuous bonding and claiming at the rebond time. \n\nAssuming an investment of $4.5mm and a yield of 27.24% APR , Wonderland would achieve a yield of $3,358 per day. \n\nRealized yield may fluctuate based on a wide variety of factors. The Treasury Operators will monitor the positions to maximize profitability and manage risk.\n\n## Chicken Bonds Background:\nChicken Bonds is a novel bonding mechanism which allows protocols to bootstrap liquidity at minimal cost and provides better user protection than existing bonding alternatives. \n\nBonding offers an amplified yield-earning opportunity for LUSD holders. Holders can “Chicken Out” at any time, effectively canceling their bond and claiming their principal back. This makes bonding a low risk endeavor for Wonderland aside from some minimal risks (detailed below).\n\nBonding LUSD in exchange for bLUSD will offer Wonderland a boosted yield compared to depositing LUSD in the Stability Pool. \n\n- **Docs/Resources:** Official Chicken Bonds Documentation - LUSD Chicken Bonds\n\n## Risks/Concerns\n\n#### Redemption Impact\nChicken Bonds will be considered liquid as they can be redeemed at any time by “Chickening Out” to regain the original principal deposited. Therefore, there will be no impact to the redemption price. \n\n#### Sifu Vision (SV) Exposure\nSV currently has $9.2mm in Chicken Bond exposure. Wonderland owns roughly 60% of SV tokens, giving us an additional $5.5mm in SV exposure to Chicken Bonds.\n\n#### LUSD Price Risk/Peg Stability\nThere is some price risk as LUSD has been trading over peg for several months (currently trading at $1.03), and could peg back to $1 (or depeg under $1). The TOs believe the likelihood of LUSD depegging below $1 is very minimal due to the overcollateralization of LUSD and lack of centralization risks.\n\n#### Smart Contract Risk\nSince Chicken Bonds deposit funds to B.Protocol and the Yearn Curve LUSD vault, users implicitly assume the smart contract risk of those external protocols when using Chicken Bonds. Chicken Bonds, Liquity.app, Yearn, and B. Protocol have all undergone audits. ",

The protocol works with cross-chain messages to communicate with contracts on other chains and build transactions. Users always know the exact amount of desired tokens they will receive on another chain! No need to bridge assets, look for the liquidity pairs or worry about price volatility. We have it all covered for you! We are building an ecosystem that will bring trading in DeFi to another level! We are excited provide various outstanding opportunities for our users:\n> * Interchain swaps\n> * Stable coin liquidity utilization\n> * Arbitrage opportunities\n> * Revenue share model\n> * Integrations and partnerships \n\n## Investment Details:\nThe purchased ITP tokens will be vested over 2 years with a 6 months cliff. In other words, the first claim will be available after six months and would account for 25% of purchased tokens. The remaining vesting period is linear. At a price of $0.30/ITP token we would be effectively investing at a $45mm FDV. With an investment size of $1.5mm, WL’s exposure to Interport would be a little over 1% of its total treasury size. \n\n## Rationale:\nInterport’s objectives of making cross-chain easy aligns with Wonderland’s vision of expanding DeFi by investing in projects that lay foundations for the future. \n\nTaking part in this private raise could have significant upside for Wonderland should the project prove to be successful while having limited downside due to the amount of capital allocated (slightly above 1% for the proposed amount of $1.5mm).\n\nInterport has a finished product awaiting audit and imminent launch. We have had the opportunity to test the product and are very excited about it and the upcoming launch.\n\nInterport has a lot of potential and a favorable risk/return at current valuation. This would also help Wonderland continue the diversification of its treasury.\n\n**Conservative calculations indicate:**\nAssumption: $1 million trading volume per day, per network\nExpected result: $2.2 billion yearly volume, $4mm revenue\nValuation: P/E ~11 (based on $45mm FDV)\n\nAssumption: $2 million trading volume per day, per network\nExpected result: $4.4 billion yearly volume, $8mm revenue\nValuation: P/E ~5 (based on $45mm FDV)\n\nAssumption: $4 million trading volume per day, per network\nExpected result: $8.8 billion yearly volume, $16mm revenue\nValuation: P/E ~2.5 (based on $45mm FDV)\n\nOur investment would put Interport at a valuation of $45mm FDV.\n\nVolumes on other major DEX:\nUniswap v3 ~300mm-1bn\nPancakeswap v2 ~100-300mm\nDodo ~80mm\nCurve (eth) ~50mm\nKyberswap (Arbitrum) ~60mm\n\nTotal daily DEX volume in the current bear market is in the $1-3bn range.  In the previous bull market DEX volume was around $7-8bn daily.\n\nThis means that Interport needs to capture less than 1% market share in order to achieve favorable returns.\n\nIt is worth noting this napkin math only takes basic swaps into consideration.\nOther factors that will increase earnings include:\nArbitrage revenue from performance fees\nOptimal swap fees through routing advantages\n\n#### Token Utility:\nHaving ITP tokens, Wonderland will be able to participate in revenue share staking (single sided or LP, whichever preferred). This revenue is shared in USDT and represents 40% of protocol earnings. Staking also gives ITP tokens.\n- https://interport.gitbook.io/interport/itp-utilization-and-economics\n\n#### Team Details and Potential Conflicts:\nInterport is run by a core team consisting of the Dev Lead (DSB), project manager and tech lead (whereto) and Sifu (advisor).  Whereto is also tech lead on UwU Lend, a project we are deployed on and hold vesting tokens.  The primary TO proposing this investment (Ferengi) has met both DSB and whereto in person to discuss this project and our potential investment into it before Sifu was asked to join the project.\n\nWhereto studied finance in London, worked on models, and brokered deals for IPOs.  His first crypto project was in 2017 and he has been working in the space since then with deep experience in both finance and software development.\n\n## Risks/Considerations:\n#### Smart Contract Risk:\nWhile we would not be directly affected by Smart Contract risks because we would be holding spot tokens, any new protocol has smart contracts and exploit risks present that may reduce the native token price. Interport is currently in process of getting audited by Hacken and it will not be deployed until that has been completed to safeguard user funds.\n\nThey will be added to the documentation page as they become available:\n- https://interport.gitbook.io/interport/rocket-science/audits\n\n#### Price Risk:\nInterport is a new project in the launch phase and there is risk it may not succeed. Our entry price is significantly below market launch price (currently trading around $1.40 compared to our entry at $0.30).\n\n#### Redemption\nJust like any illiquid token, these would be excluded from the redemption value while they are locked. Additionally, given the nature of this deal, a minimum of 75% of the liquid tokens would be excluded from the redemption value.\n\n#### Disclosure:\nSome moderators and team members at Wonderland are helping at Interport and receiving a small (0.2% each) allocation (Alice, Bamchicka, Catalyst, ruian, Gin). The proposing TOs also hold exposure to Interport due to their confidence in the project’s success.\n\n#### Team members roles:\nAlice - handles announcements, point of contact for BD\nBamchicka - compiles information, assists with Discord support\nCatalyst - Discord side tech support, testing\nruian - docs editing\nGin - Discord support\n\n#### Re-vote of the TMP:\nThis TMP has been voted on in a similar form before and each previous vote showed that there was need for more information. We ask our voters to check the various links to previous discussions in the #TMP channel on discord and invite you to @ the Treasury Team to clarify further, before voting.\n",

      "title": "[TMP #7] - Community Proposal: Metavault",
      "content": "## Scope:\nRequest DAO approval to deploy funds into Metavault via MVLP on Polygon.\n\n## Current Governance Limitations:\nPer WIP #27:\n> Any seemingly valid strategy has to be properly **vetted by the Risk Officer**, voted by the treasury council and go through the proper governance process when applicable.\n\nWhile the proposed investment can be voted by the Treasury Council, the above guidelines cannot be followed as expected due to the current lack of Risk Officer, a TMP is being used to assist treasury personnel with decision making by having the DAO review the proposal, assess the risks and make the final decision.\n\n## Objective:\n* Deploy $2mm USDC into MVLP in Metavault on the Polygon chain. \n* Purchase and stake $25k of MVX\n\n## Rationale & Metavault Background:\nThe Wonderland Treasury still has a lot of unallocated stables and given the current market conditions there are limited directional opportunities. \n\nMetavault is a GMX fork on Polygon.  Their MVLP token is akin to GMX’s GLP token that has proven very popular.  GLP holds significantly more stables than MVLP so we will be able to mint MVLP at an attractive rate by supplying stables to balance the pool of tokens.\n\nFor [WIP #19](https://www.wonderlandforum.xyz/t/wip-19-earn-yield-on-part-of-our-eth-and-btc-using-glp/19323) the DAO voted in favor of investing 12.5mm in GMX/GLP. Given that the risks are similar and the size of the investment considerably less, the treasury team agrees this proposal is safe and will provide good returns while waiting for market conditions to improve.\n\nExpected returns are ~25-35% annually.  Around 30% of this is paid in Matic (Polygon’s token) and 70% in esMVX (akin to esGMX on GMX).\n\nMVLP consists of 35% stables (target weight on stables is 45%), with the rest being directional tokens, primarily BTC, ETH and Matic.  This compared to GLP at 49% stables means we will have a bit more upside (and downside) potential as the market evolves.\n\nMVX has a MC of just over $8mm.  This means a lot of potential for growth.  Polygon has over $1bn TVL, slightly more than Arbitrum where GMX is primarily housed.\n\nGMX has first mover advantage but there is a large amount of capital on Polygon to serve.\n\nThe Treasury team suggests buying $25k worth of spot tokens to stake due to the high growth potential in this project.  Our deposit into the ecosystem will boost their AUM by 25% and growth should follow as it is correlated with available liquidity.\n\nStaked MVX tokens currently receive an additional 36% APR with 6.7% coming in Matic rewards with the remainder in esMVX.\n\nThe Treasury Operators will monitor the positions to maximize profitability and manage risk.\n\nMetavault site: https://app.metavault.trade/#/dashboard\n\n## Risks:\n\n#### Smart Contract Risk:\nSmart contract risk will always be present.  This is a fork of GMX which has been through audits.  MVX has had their own audit.  Link to the audit and docs below.\n\n**Docs:**\n* https://docs.metavault.trade/audit\n* https://gmxio.gitbook.io/gmx/audit\n\n#### Price Risk:\nThis is a relatively low risk position.  If the market continues to move down we will experience some losses, though not nearly as much as if we were holding spot ETH and BTC.  Generated yields will help reduce this.\n\nMetavault may experience attacks similar to GMX, though substantially less likely.  This is done through highly leveraged positions along with market manipulation attempts.  Metavault has only $10mm AUM with WL adding (assets under management) so an attack of this type is improbable.",

      "title": "[TMP #2.2] - Authorize Treasury Council to lock UwU-ETH LP Tokens",
      "content": "## Scope:\nRequest DAO approval to authorize the Treasury Council to lock UwU-ETH LP tokens on UwU Lend using currently held/vesting UwU and future UwU rewards.\n\n## Current Governance Limitations:\nCurrently, WIP #14 requires explicit DAO approval for “long term defined lock ups”. By voting yes on this proposal, the DAO would be giving permission to lock UwU-ETH LP tokens on Uwu Lend.\n\n## Objective:\nUtilize the UwU acquired from rewards and private OTC deal to capitalize on the LP yield at the discretion of the Treasury Council.\nGrow the size of the allocation while the yield is high, since there are limited high yielding farms currently in DeFi.\nLower our cost basis on OTC tokens that were purchased.\n\n\n## Plan/Strategy:\nThe team is requesting the DAO’s permission to lock UwU-ETH LP tokens to increase the yield received in conjunction with supplying assets on Uwu Lend and reduce the cost basis of the previous deal.\n\nThe impact of selling UwU could create a significant price decline in UwU which would have a negative impact on our vesting UwU from the OTC deal and the UwU indirectly held in Sifu Vision’s (SV) wallet.\n\nThe locking period on UwU-ETH LP tokens is 8 weeks. After the 8 weeks, tokens are permanently unlocked and available to be unstaked at any time. Staked tokens (locked and unlocked) receive revenue share currently yielding 156% APR, mostly in stables.\n\nUsing our UwU rewards this way would be the most profitable option for Wonderland.\n\n## Rationale:\nIt is in Wonderland’s favor to utilize the UwU rewards while the yields are high, since there are currently limited high yielding farms in DeFi. This will also prevent the recently purchased UwU tokens from remaining idle during the full vesting period of 24 months.\n\nUtilizing the rewards will help maintain a low cost basis on our UwU by collecting revenue share in the form of a basket of tokens, majority of which is in stable coins. After doing their due diligence and strategy planning, the Treasury Operators (TO) are convinced that locking into the LP is the better choice versus selling UwU to lower the cost basis further.\n\nFurthermore, selling the rewards would impact UwU Lend’s ability to attract TVL, limiting long term yields in the LP which would otherwise benefit both SV and Wonderland.\n\nFor clarity, there will be no further acquisition of UwU other than by farming.\n\n‘Farming’ refers to activities that generate a positive yield partially or totally in UwU, e.g UwU-ETH LP, providing credit on UwU Lend, or future vaults on UwU Lend.\n\n## UwU Lend Background:\nUwU Lend is a liquidity market that offers depositing and borrowing forked from AAVE v2. Users earn interest on deposits and pay interest to borrow. The protocol was founded and is managed by Sifu.\n\nMore details available here:\n\n- Website: https://uwulend.fi/\n- Docs: https://docs.uwulend.fi/\n\n## Risks/Considerations:\n#### Price Risk:\nUwU price could decline, potentially lower than our current cost basis over time (currently $9.60 per UwU on farmed tokens). New UwU-ETH LP tokens will be locked for a total of 8 weeks preventing the sale of locked tokens during this timeframe. After the 8 weeks, tokens are permanently unlocked and available to be unstaked at any time, or left staked accumulating revenue share.\n\n#### Smart Contract Risk:\nUwU Lend code was forked from Aave v2, which has undergone numerous audits. The rewards system is forked from Geist, which has also undergone numerous audits. UwU Lend has completed its independent audit with Peckshield for all contracts, including the upcoming vaults and results will be published soon.\n\n#### Liquidity Risk:\nThe LP for UwU-ETH is incentivized and helps in the short term with price stability due to the 8 week lock. However, as the weeks pass, we will have less forecastable liquidity as providers can pull out funds. To mitigate this uncertainty, Wonderland will actively manage its UwU position to capitalize on periods of stronger liquidity and decrease its need for liquidity when uncertainty is greater.\n\n## Disclosure:\nSome moderators and team members at Wonderland are also team members at UwU (Alice, Bamchicka, Catalyst, ruian, Vayu). The proposing TOs have experience with the platform and also hold exposure to UwU Lend.\n\n## Re-vote of the TMP:\nThis TMP has been voted on, in similar form before and each previous vote showed that there was more need for clarification. We ask our voters to check the various links to previous discussions in the #TMP channel on discord and invite you to @ the Treasury Team to clarify further, before to cast your vote.",

      "title": "[1.2] - Approval to increase protocol exposure limit for UwU Lend to a maximum of 20%",
      "content": "## Scope:\nRequest DAO approval to increase the protocol exposure for UwU Lend to a maximum of 20% of the total treasury.\n\n## Current Governance Limitations:\nBy voting yes on this proposal, the DAO would be giving permission to exceed the current 10% protocol exposure limit in the Treasury Allocation Proposal (WIP #26) to up to 20%.\n\n## Objective:\nIncrease the exposure limit to UwU Lend to 20% of the total treasury. If this limit is exceeded due to directional price movement, the Treasury Council will remove assets to maintain exposure under the 20% limit.\nAllow the Treasury Council to adjust the allocations within UwU in accordance with the 20% limit.\nThis limit will include UwU tokens held and tokens in the LP.\n\n## Plan/Strategy:\nThe team is requesting a mandate from the DAO to deploy treasury assets into Uwu Lend not to exceed 20% of treasury value. The initial proposal looked at increasing the exposure up to 16% of treasury assets, but excluded the UwU and LP tokens. The percentage was increased to 20% to leave some additional wiggle room for deployment of the UwU-ETH LP position, as we acquire more UwU from farming and vesting.\n\nThe TOs plan is to allocate roughly 16% towards stablecoins. The remaining 4% will be reserved for UwU and UwU-ETH LP tokens as well as a small buffer to help adjust the position, as we acquire more UwU from farming and vesting.\n\nThe UwU-ETH LP will only be deployed if TMP 2.2 is approved by the DAO, allowing us to lock the UwU-ETH tokens for 8 week periods.\n\n## Rationale:\nThe current strategy is to maintain a sizable treasury allocation on UwU Lend farms while the yields are high, since there are currently limited high yielding farms in DeFi. Furthermore, the Treasury Operators (TO) due diligence shows that the risks of deploying on UwU Lend are lower than other protocols with comparable yields or newer, unproven protocols which may have elevated smart contract risk relative to UwU Lend. This strategy will allow the treasury to earn yield on a higher percentage of its assets with relatively low risks while keeping stable assets.\n\nIncreasing the exposure limit aims at reducing the cost basis. The TOs estimate that farming and locking into the LP is a better alternative versus selling UwU to lower the cost basis further. The impact of selling UwU could cause a significant price decline in UwU which would have a negative impact on our vesting UwU from the OTC deal and the indirect exposure to UwU through our SV investment. Furthermore, this would impact UwU Lend’s ability to attract TVL, limiting long term yields in the LP which would otherwise benefit Wonderland directly and indirectly through SV.\n\nFor clarity, there will be no further acquisition of UwU other than by farming. Further acquisition of UwU by other means would require a separate proposal.\n\n‘Farming’ refers to activities that generate a positive yield partially or totally in UwU, e.g UwU-ETH LP, providing credit on UwU Lend, or future vaults on UwU Lend.\n\n## UwU Lend Background:\nUwU Lend is a liquidity market that offers depositing, borrowing and its lending market is forked from Aave V2. Users earn interest on deposits and pay interest to borrow. The protocol was founded and is actively managed by Sifu.\n\nMore details available here:\n- Website: https://uwulend.fi/\n- Docs: https://docs.uwulend.fi/\n\n## Risks:\n#### Price Risk:\nUwU price could decline and farmed tokens need to be vested for 4 weeks to not incur a penalty fee. Our current cost basis for UwU tokens farmed so far is $9.60 and will continue to decrease as we switch from looping to supply-side. This cost basis can be lowered further by farming rewards in the UwU-ETH LP, which requires a separate approval of TMP 2.2.\n\n#### Smart Contract Risk:\nUwU Lend code was forked from Aave v2, which has undergone numerous audits. The rewards system is forked from geist, which has also undergone numerous audits. UwU Lend has completed its independent audit with Peckshield for all contracts, including the upcoming vaults and results will be published soon.\n\n#### Liquidity Risk:\nThe LP for UwU-ETH is incentivized and helps in the short term with price stability due to the 8 week lock. However, as the weeks pass, we will have less forecastable liquidity as providers can pull out funds.

This does not mean the full amount will be used.\n\n## Rationale:\n\nInterport’s objectives of making cross-chain easy aligns with Wonderland’s vision of expanding DeFi by investing in projects that lay foundations for the future.\n\nTaking part in this presale could have significant upside for Wonderland should the project prove to be successful while having limited downside due to the amount of capital allocated (slightly above 1% for 1.5mm).\n\nIt is believed that Interport has a lot of potential and a favorable risk/return at current valuation. This would also help Wonderland continue the diversification of its treasury.\n\n## Investment Details:\n\nITP tokens purchased at the seed round will be vested over 2 years with a 6 months cliff. In other words, the first claim will be available after six months and would account for 25% of purchased tokens. The remaining vesting period is linear.\n\nInterport is raising at a $30mm valuation.\n\n### Brief Summary:\nInterport is a decentralized exchange that allows you to perform Interchain swaps (cross-chain swaps) at the best rate due to cross chain liquidity aggregation contracts that source over 250 dexes and liquidity sources looking for the best price.\n\nInterport allows you to buy tokens on any supported chain without the need to bridge. Interchain swaps will be available on 6 networks including Ethereum, BSC, Polygon, Avalanche, Fantom, and Arbitrum.\n\n### More details available here:\nDocs: ITP Utilization and Economics - Interport (gitbook.io)\nWebsite: Interport.fi (website)\n\n## Risks/Considerations:\n\n### Smart Contract Risk:\n\nWhile we would not be directly affected by Smart Contract risks, any new protocol has smart contract and exploit risks present. While Interport has not yet been audited, it does plan to be audited.\n\nThey should be added to the documentation page as they become available:\n- interport.gitbook.io\n\n### Audits\nAvailable audit reports\n\n### Price Risk:\n\nGiven that this is a seed round and funds will be used to launch the project, there is always a risk that the project may not succeed. This would of course have an affect on the token price and therefore impact the profitability of the investment.\n\n### Redemption\n\nJust like any illiquid token, these would be excluded from the redemption value while they are locked. Additionally, given the nature of this deal, a minimum of 75% of the liquid tokens would be excluded from the redemption value.",

      "content": "## Scope:\nRequest DAO approval to deploy funds on Wombex Finance.\n\n## Current Governance Limitations:\nAs per [WIP #27](https://www.wonderlandforum.xyz/t/wip-27-community-rewards-proposal/19857): Any seemingly valid strategy has to be properly vetted by the Risk Officer, voted by the treasury council and go through the proper governance process when applicable.\n\nWhile the proposed investment can be voted by the Treasury Council, the above guidelines cannot be followed as expected due to the current lack of Risk Officer, a TMP is being used to assist treasury personnel with decision making by having the DAO review the proposal, assess the risks and make the final decision.\n\n## Objective:\n* Deploy $3mm USDC and $1mm DAI into Wombex Finance on Binance Smart Chain (BSC).\n\n## Rationale:\nThe Wonderland Treasury still has a lot of unallocated stables and given the current market conditions there are limited directional opportunities. It is believed that the nature of this proposal is relatively safe and will provide decent returns while waiting for market conditions to improve.\nReturns are expected to be 8-14% annually.\nThis will generate from $320,000 to $560,000 annually or $876.71 to $1,534.25 daily*.\n> *These returns are only estimates and will vary. Treasury Operators will monitor profitability and manage the position. Yields change frequently in DeFi.\nThis is a straightforward stable farm brought forth by a community member through the community proposal system. In the absence of a Risk Officer, the DAO is being asked to accept the risk by providing its approval.\n \n## Wombex Finance Background:\nWombat (https://www.wombat.exchange/, TVL $150mm on BSC) is a stableswap DEX and fork of Platypus (Avalanche; peak TVL was $1.25bn) with some modifications, particularly a different pool invariant function.\nWombex has a TVL of $73mm, and is built on top of Wombat. It operates in a similar way to Convex on top of Curve.\n\n## Risks/Considerations:\n\n#### Smart Contract Risk:\nSmart contract, execution and exploit risk are present as usual.\nWombex has been audited twice:\nhttps://docs.wombex.finance/audits\nWombat, the underlying exchange, has been audited four times:\nhttps://docs.wombat.exchange/docs/resources/security-audits.\nPlatypus, the protocol that Wombat was forked from has also been audited (see \"Audits\" menu):\nhttps://platypus.finance/\n\n### Impermanent Loss:\nIf pooled stables depeg it can cause an imbalance, leading to IL.\n",

      "content": "## Scope:\nRequest DAO approval to increase the allocation limit to UWU Lend to 20% of the total treasury for a period not to exceed 120 days unless an additional TMP to do so is submitted and approved by the DAO.\n\n## Current Governance Limitations:\nBy voting yes on this proposal, the DAO would be giving temporary permission to exceed the 10% protocol exposure limit in the Treasury Allocation Proposal (WIP #26) for 120 days or until voted otherwise by the Treasury Council or the DAO, whichever comes first.\n\n## Objective:\nIncrease the exposure limit to UWU Lend to 20% of the total treasury.\nAllow the Treasury Council to adjust the allocations within UWU in accordance with the 20% limit.\n\nThis limit will include UWU tokens held and tokens in the LP.\n\n## Rationale:\nIt is believed that it would be in Wonderland’s favor to maintain a sizable treasury allocation on UWU Lend farms while the yields are high, since there are currently limited high yielding farms in DeFi.\n\nFor clarity, there will be no further acquisition of UWU other than by farming and vesting prepaid tokens. Further acquisition of UWU by other means would require a separate TMP. ‘Farming’ refers to activities that generate a positive yield partially or totally in UWU, e.g UWU-ETH LP, providing credit on uwulend, or future vaults on uwulend.\n\n## UWU Lend Background\nUWU Lend is a liquidity market that offers depositing and borrowing and is forked from AAVE v2. Users earn interest on deposits and pay interest to borrow. The protocol was founded and is actively managed by Sifu. Wonderland is currently supplying DAI, USDT, and Sifu in the UWU Lend farms. We are borrowing DAI and USDT for looping, with a Health Rate of 1.20.\n\n## Risks/Considerations:\n#### Price Risk:\nUWU price could continue to drop and farmed tokens need to be vested for 4 weeks to not incur a penalty fee. No loss would be incurred unless the price of UWU dropped below our cost basis ($11.02 per UWU on farmed tokens).\n\n#### Smart Contract Risk:\nUWU Lend code was forked from Aave v2, which has undergone numerous audits. The rewards system is forked from geist, which has also undergone numerous audits. UWU Lend has completed its independent audit with Peckshield and results will be published soon.\n\n#### Liquidity Risk:\nThe LP for UWU-ETH is incentivized and guarantees short-term stability due to the 8 week lock. However, as the weeks pass, we will have less forecastable liquidity as providers can pull out funds. To mitigate this uncertainty, Wonderland will actively manage its UWU position to capitalize on periods of stronger liquidity and decrease its need for liquidity when uncertainty is greater.",

By voting yes on this proposal, the DAO would be giving permission for the next 120 days or until voted otherwise by the Treasury Council or DAO, whichever comes first, to lock UWU-ETH LP tokens.\n\nThe minimum locking period on UWU-ETH LP tokens is 8 weeks. After the 8 weeks, tokens are permanently unlocked and available to exit.\n\n## Objective:\nUtilize the UWU acquired from rewards and private OTC deal to capitalize on the LP yield at the discretion of the Treasury Council.\n\nGrow the size of the allocation while the yield is high, since there are limited high yielding farms currently in DeFi.\n\nLower our cost basis on OTC tokens that were purchased.\n\n## Rationale:\nIt is believed that it would be in Wonderland’s favor to utilize the UWU rewards while the yields are high, since there are currently limited high yielding farms in DeFi.\n\nThis would also prevent the recently purchased UWU tokens from remaining idle during the full vesting period of 24 months.\n\nUtilizing the rewards would also help maintain a low cost basis on our UWU by acquiring additional UWU and other tokens from the LP rewards.\n\nTo further clarify, there will be no further acquisition of UWU other than by farming and vesting prepaidpre-paid tokens. ‘Farming’ is limited to activities that generate a positive yield partially or totally in UWU, e.g UWU-ETH LP, providing credit on Uwulend, or potentially future vaults on Uwulend.\n\n## UWU Lend Background:\nUwU Lend is a liquidity market that offers depositing and borrowing forked from AAVE v2.

New tokens added to the LP will be locked for a total of 8 weeks preventing the sale of locked tokens during this timeframe. After the 8 weeks, tokens are permanently unlocked and available to exit.\n\n#### Smart Contract Risk:\nUWU Lend code was forked from Aave v2, which has undergone numerous audits.

      "title": "[TMP #2] - Authorize Treasury Council to Lock UwU-Eth LP Tokens Into ",
      "content": "## Scope:\n\nAuthorize the Treasury Council to lock UWU-ETH LP tokens using current and future rewards, until voted otherwise by the Treasury Council or DAO.\n\n## Current Governance Limitations:\n\nCurrently, WIP #14 requires explicit DAO approval for “long term defined lock ups”. By voting yes on this proposal, the DAO would be giving permission to lock the farmed UWU tokens in the LP (pool2) until voted otherwise by the Treasury Council or DAO. The minimum locking period on UWU-Eth LP tokens is 8 weeks. After the 8 weeks, tokens are permanently unlocked and available to exit.\n\n## Objective:\n\n- Utilize the UWU acquired from the farm and private OTC deal to capitalize on the LP (pool2) yield at the discretion of the treasury council.\n- Grow the size of the allocation while the yield is high, since there are limited high yielding farms currently in DeFi.\n- Lower our cost basis on OTC tokens that were purchased.\n\n## Rationale:\nIt is believed that it would be in Wonderland’s favor to utilize the UWU rewards while the yields are high, since there are currently limited high yielding farms in DeFi.\n\nUtilizing the rewards would also help maintain a low cost basis on our UWU by acquiring additional UWU and other tokens from the LP rewards.\n\nThis would also prevent the recently purchased UWU tokens from remaining idle during the full vesting period of 24 months.\n\n## UWU Lend Background:\nUwU Lend is a liquidity market that offers depositing and borrowing forked from AAVE v2. Users earn interest on deposits and pay interest to borrow. The protocol was founded and is managed by Sifu.\n\n## Risks/Considerations:\n\n#### UWU Directional Price/Locking Risk:\nUWU price could continue to drop, potentially lower than our cost basis over time. New LP tokens added to the LP (Pool2) will be locked for a total of 8 weeks preventing the sale of locked tokens during this timeframe. After the 8 weeks, tokens are permanently unlocked and available to exit.\n\n#### Smart Contract Risk:\nUWU is a fork of AAVE v2. While UWU has not undergone its own audit yet, it is forked from audited code.",

This is not a bounty system, and rewards are not paid immediately, but when profits have been locked in.\n\n## High Level Overview\nThis proposal will provide guidelines on the following:\n- Procedures\n- Eligibility\n- Reward distribution\n\n## Provide Low Level Details\n**Procedure**\nCommunity members will be able to present an opportunity via a ticket bot system.\n\nEach ticket should include, at minimum, the following details:\n\n- Project/Protocol name & official links\n- A summary of the due diligence done (e.g. founders/management details, history, etc)\n- Risk assessment and profitability estimation, including a realistic range of returns\n- Timeline for profit taking estimations\n- For seed investments, a full project plan with all standard forecasts should be included.\n\nTickets will be reviewed, answered and recorded, to be released for transparency when needed, or to settle disputes.\n\nAny seemingly valid strategy has to be properly vetted by the Risk Officer, voted by the treasury council and go through the proper governance process when applicable. Any community strategy implemented is to be managed and overseen by the applicable elected member(s).\n\nAny tickets that do not meet the minimum requirements will be discarded with the reason why it was not considered. To be reconsidered, a new ticket with the missing information should be submitted.\n\n**Eligibility requirements and reward distribution:**\nThe submitted opportunity must meet a profitability threshold of a minimum of 10% annualized ROI for the protocol - this threshold may be reviewed and changed depending on market conditions via the established DAO treasury guideline votes.\n\nTickets will be eligible on a first come first serve basis.\n\n**Reward Distribution**\nRewards for strategies must be gained within the estimated and negotiated timeline for profit taking. A reward of 3% based on applicable profits per opportunity is proposed. This main may be reviewed and changed via the established DAO treasury guideline votes.\n\nIf a strategy fails to achieve the minimum threshold within the agreed timeline, no rewards occur. If a strategy meets the goal within a delay of 25% the original agreed timeline, a reward of 1,5% shall be given.\n\nIf a strategy reaches 20% annualized ROI an additional 2% will be awarded (5% total).\n\nThese rewards will be distributed when profit is claimed and calculated on the total profit amount, before final distribution to the farm/treasury. Rewards are given in the claimed profit asset.\n\n## Business and technical requirements of the implementation of the proposal:\nA bot to record submissions will have to be created as well as proper documentation for the distribution of rewards.\n\nThese community strategies are to be disclosed on a quarterly basis once a strategy has been completed and the criteria to pay the proposer were met or after a strategy was declined and releasing it shall have minimal consequences.",

      "content": "## Scope\nThe scope of this proposal is the define an official structure for Wonderland as well as create the positions required to maintain the protocol running smoothly.\n\n## Objective:\nThis proposal aims to implement a management structure by creating a Management Team with clearly defined positions and duties. The goal of this initiative is to make Wonderland’s workload and responsibilities more transparent and efficient.\n\nMoreover, this proposal opens up the possibility of rewarding the community and volunteers for their contribution without creating fixed positions for them.\n\n## High Level Overview\nThis proposal will define the following items:\nHigh level organizational structure\nProposed Management Team structure/roles\nOfficially define the Treasury Council\nImpact of the current changes\n\n## Provide Low Level Details\nOrganizational Structure\nDAO: Ultimate decision maker setting the guidelines and vision for the protocol to operate.\nManagement Team: The Management Team is composed of key positions that ensure the stability and proper operation of the protocol on a daily basis. Management Team members are elected by the DAO and are responsible for carrying out the DAO’s vision.\nTreasury Team: The Treasury Team includes any position that is focus on investing the treasury (e. g. Treasury Operators). Investments proposed should meet the DAO’s guidelines/risk limits.\nTreasury Council: The Treasury Council is made up of knowledgeable community members that vote on proposed strategies.\nMultisig: The multisig executes the transactions voted on by the Treasury Council. WIP #21 has elected the current multisig members.\nProposed management positions\nIt is believed Wonderland would benefit from the proposed structure by having a Management Team of 6 committed and trustworthy members, to ensure the protocol is well-managed and efficiently operated at all times executing the DAO's will.\n\nStructure and terms:\n\nMembers of the Management Team should be long-standing members of the community who have demonstrated a continuous commitment and regular involvement over a period of at least three months.\nEvery six months, all management team members should be reviewed by the DAO.\nEach member is reviewed individually, through a special forum thread with a poll. In the event that the poll results show less than 70% support, a snapshot vote will be conducted.\nIf their work is deemed unsatisfactory, management team members can be removed from their positions through the governance processes or by voluntary resignation.\nAny open spot shall be temporarily covered equally by the other team members, until a new person is voted in.\nIt is proposed to place some of the currently elected officials for half a term in the positions described below, with the first evaluation scheduled after 3 months to continue the current transition.\n\nCommunications Officer - Alice in Wonderland • @AliceInWonderland\n\nThe Communication Officer serves as the face of the DAO. They are generally responsible for managing and handling communications in both directions. They are involved in various activities such as communications, PR, social media, and events.\n\nResponsibilities\nDeprecate the Senior Moderator position and assume its responsibilities.\nCorrespondence and communication with external parties for any non-treasury related topic.\nMaintaining Wonderland’s social media presence and ensuring the security of the accounts.\nPlanning and organizing regular AMAs and community events to boost brand awareness.\nProviding regular updates to the community and managing community issues.\nWhen necessary, provide factual information to reduce FUD.\nManaging the Snapshot account and publishing votes.\nMarketing of educational content on all platforms\nIn charge of holding, securing, managing, and distributing the budget of the Team. *¹\n\nOperations Officer - Queen of Hearts • TBD / Call Letter\n\nThe Operations Officer ensures that all operations are documented in detail, conducted efficiently, and with the utmost transparency.

Provide transparent info to the Communications Officer, for DAO transparency.\nEnsure that workflow and information flow are established, both within and outside the Team.\nVerification of information before communication material is officially published.\nFeedback from the community is collected and relayed to the appropriate departments.\nMonitoring of the Treasury Council, relay results/info to applicable departments.\nKeep track of internal work, document it, and organize departments’ collaboration efforts, when necessary, while ensuring deadlines are met.\nEnsure proper steps are taken once legal advice is received to ensure legal compliance and reduce liability.\n\nTechnical Officer - Cheshire Cat • @Catalyst\n\nThe Technical Officer is responsible for the maintenance and improvement of the protocol’s platforms. Furthermore, they ensure that all relevant technical information is properly documented and available for review by the DAO.\n\nResponsibilities\nMaintaining Wonderland Tech, improving it, and adding new features as necessary.\nEnsure that Wonderland’s smart contracts are functioning properly.\nCreating and maintaining bots for Discord.\nImprovements to the security of Discord and dApp.\nEnsure that routine technical tasks are completed in a timely manner.\nCommunity feedback is implemented.\nEnsure that all token statistics are displayed on an up-to-date dashboard in accordance with Treasury Council guidelines.\nThis further enhances WIP #24 by adding a Technical Officer role, responsible for managing Wonderland’s technical aspects. Additionally, they would be responsible for the funding allocated for maintaining Wonderland sites and underlying IT, up to a maximum of $10,000 per month. Please refer to WIP for more information.\n\nThe allocation will reimburse any costs incurred prior to this vote for maintaining the backend.\n\nGovernance Officer - Timekeeper • @NalX\n\nThe Governance Officer is responsible to enforce the DAO’s frameworks and ensure the proper documentation of the DAO’s vision, roles, votes, etc. They shall ensure that the DAO members have the tools necessary to engage in the governance process.\n\nResponsibilities\nMonitoring the progress of governance proposals.\nAnalyzing proposals for conflicts, risks, and compliance with previous DAO decisions.\nFollowing a vote by the DAO, ensure that official documents are amended as necessary.\nThe provision of insight regarding the compliance of the internal strategy with the DAO code.\nEnsure that the governance framework, voted policies, and legal requirements are adhered to.\nContribute to the development of proposals by the team and community.\nManaging the Wonderland Forum as an administrator, including pins, moderation, and structure.\nLead governance discussion and promote engagement.\nEnsure the legal aspects of the DAO are taken into consideration and professional opinions considered.\nUntil a formal legal budget is allocated, if legal advice is required for the DAO governance aspects, the required expenses will be voted on by the Council. Upon receipt of this approval, the DAO will be notified within 48 hours when applicable.\nAll costs for legal consults will be covered by the treasury and included in the treasury report.\n\nFinancial Officer - Caterpillar • @ruian\n\nThe Financial Officer is responsible for the organization of repeatable tasks (e.g. claiming rewards, monitoring farm, etc) in the absence of prior standardized DAO decisions or enforcing said decisions when applicable.\n\nIn addition, they are the main point of contact for external requests/offers such as venture capital investments, listing and partnerships. To ensure a smooth flow of information and risk management, they must maintain close communication with the Risk Officer and Operations Officer.\n\nResponsibilities\nPoint of contact for negotiations with 3rd parties, such as OTC deals, investment conditions, partnerships, etc.\nOrganization and management of deployed strategies and their profitability according to DAO guidelines, protocol owned liquidity pools, rewards claims and Wonderland’s farm.\nProviding assistance to the newly elected members in developing strategies.\nCreates monthly Treasury Performance reports to ensure holders are provided necessary insights into the effectiveness of the protocol.\nReview performance of elected treasury team members and monitor trading rewards.\nHelp coordinate redemptions.\nAssist is assessing community proposed strategies for risks and conflicts.\nWork with the Risk Officer to help the DAO establish proper guidelines/risk limits.\nIn order to qualify for the Financial Officer position, candidates must possess a comprehensive understanding of the protocol, as well as a general understanding of DeFi. Prior to applying for this position, an interview with the Risk Officer is requested, to ensure that the position is filled as efficiently and effectively as possible.\n\nThis ensures the execution of the DAO's guidelines and treasury deployment based on the wishes of the collective will.\n\nIt is believed these positions are required to properly ensures the execution of the DAO's vision and wishes of the collective will.\n\nCompensation\nIt is proposed that the DAO works towards standardizing necessary positions and keeping costs reasonable, yet rewarding those who step forward and help the protocol on a daily basis.\n\nThe level of commitment and trust required for each of the positions is the same. It is also necessary that all positions work together in order for the protocol to function effectively. Thus, equal compensation for all Management Team members is proposed.\n\nThese are full-time positions that require daily activity. Each Management Team member is proposed to receive 0.25 wMEMO for every 30 days of service, 50% payable in stables, based on market price, upon request. Management Team members are not eligible for trade rewards.\n\nThis would incur the DAO an additional expense of 1.25 wMEMO monthly / 15 wMEMO yearly for a management team of 5 members. It is recommended that wMEMO purchased through buybacks are used to facilitate payment.\n\nCompensation will be evaluated on a regular basis to ensure they remain reasonable and align with the latest treasury guidelines. The compensation can be changed through a DAO vote.\n\nTreasury Council - Red Guards:\nA council of 5 voting members is to be implemented. Formed by 5 long standing and DeFi knowledgeable community members. The Operations Officer monitors and documents the votes and ensures the information is forwarded to all applicable positions.\n\nCouncil members shall be voted on each quarter via open call letter and evaluated by the Risk Officer for DeFi knowledge and potential bias - if this proposal is implemented, current council members will continue to occupy the positions until the first formal council election vote, without extra compensation.\n\nIf not enough community members present themselves for council spots it will be filled up with Team and elected members, based on knowledge levels and evaluated by the Risk Officer.\n\nCouncil members may propose strategies if applicable, but need to abstain from the voting process for self-proposed strategies. An elected member will fill their place temporarily.\n\nAny proposed profit bearing strategy to be voted on should include, at minimum:\n\nProject name & official links\nA summary of the due diligence done\nRisk assessment and profitability estimation\nContrary to what was initially voted in WIP #22, the Risk Officer will now identify and share with the Treasury Council the risks associated with each strategy prior to the council’s vote, when necessary, rather than evaluating the strategy after the council’s vote.\n\nCouncil members should receive compensation in the form of 0.2 wMEMO per quarter, for their time, support and service, not applicable for Management Team members or other salary receiving elected positions.\n\nThis would incur the DAO an additional expense of 1 wMEMO quarterly / 4 wMEMO yearly for a treasury council of 5 members when no other elected team members are part of the council.\n\nConsequences of the Structure Changes to existing elected member Team and their allocation\nThe current elected Team members who are not proposed for one of the management positions will remain in their current roles. They will concentrate primarily on their community support responsibilities and other duties, such as being members of the current Treasury Council, until a DAO votes on a revised formation for the council.\n\nThe previously elected team which served as Moderation Team will be reduced and will be responsible for community engagement. A maximum monthly compensation of three thousand USDC (3,000) per team member (based on equal work) is proposed. The previously allocated budget will remain the same at twenty-five thousand USDC (25,000) monthly. The newly available portion of the allocation can then be utilized for community building, events, and rewarding exceptional community service.\n\nThis change will allow more flexibility to reward community members that contribute, without the need for a proposal to have specific community members elected to be rewarded. Everyone will be encouraged to participate as a result.\n\nMembers of the Management Team may moderate, but are not required to do so and are ineligible to receive a share of this allocation.\n\n*¹ This budget will remain at the discretion of the Communications Officer role.\n\nBusiness and/or technical requirements of the implementation of the proposal\nNone",

      "content": "Scope\nThe scope of this proposal is to establish a treasury allocation policy as a guide for elected officials to work within DAO approved guidelines.\n\nLink to previous [DAO Discussion]:\n[RFC] - Treasury Allocation Proposal (TAP)\n[DAO Discussion] - Treasury Allocation Proposal (TAP)\n\nObjective\nThe purpose of this proposal is not to specify how treasury funds should be allocated or deployed at all times. Rather, it acknowledges conditions that are predetermined to be generally accepted by holders in the current market environment. Therefore, management will have more discretion and the community’s expectations will be aligned.\n\nDue to the current market’s condition, it is believed the treasury allocation parameters should maintain moderately risky positions with a majority of stable coins.\n\nHigh Level Overview:\nGuidelines will be provided on the following components:\n\nStable coins\nDirectional\nSeed Investments\nTreasury - Farm split\nTAP and adjustment procedures.\nProvide Low Level Details:\nThe allocations below are based on the current treasury value:\n\nTreasury value for current allocations\n$129,519,680 ($108,652,438 liquid)*\n\nStable Coin Assets\nA range between 45% -75% of liquid assets. A list of Stable Coins for reference include, but are not limited to, USDC, USDT, DAI, MIM, BUSD. Community strategy % goal: eg: 10 - 15% APR\n\nBetween 50% and 80% of Stable Coin Assets should be deployed in yield-generating positions, whether possible.\nDirectional Assets\nA range between 10% - 40% of liquid assets in Blue Chip positions.\n\nNo more than 20% of liquid assets should be allocated to any one directional asset at any time.\nNo more than 10% of liquid assets should be allocated to shorting strategies at any time without further DAO approval.\n80% to 90% of Directional Assets should be deployed in yield-generating positions.\nSeed Investments\nA budget of 15% of liquid assets should not be exceeded per quarter. Capital investments in the early stages of development of a protocol or product are known as seed investments.\n\nSeed assets are also subject to redemption restrictions as per WIP 9 & 18.\n\nTo fall under “seed assets”, the investment does not require equity as a result. A Simple Agreement For Future Tokens (SAFT) investment would also qualify.\n\nExposure\nWithout explicit approval from the DAO:\n\nNo more than 10% of total treasury assets should be exposed to a single protocol.\nNo more than 10% of liquid assets should be deployed at one time when initiating a new strategy\nNo more than 5% at one time if the new strategy involves protocol exposure.\ne.g. Stake 20mm in AVAX on a liquid staking platform.\n\nProcedure for Treasury Profit vs Wonderland Farm Split\nThere is currently no formal procedure in place to determine which funds should go to the treasury and which should go to the Wonderland farm. Currently, all funds are directed to the Treasury and the council votes on the farm allocation. The following default percentages for future revenue and token allocations are proposed:\n\nUpon the realizing of profits, including seed investments\n\n75% of the profit that is generated through the use of strategies shall go to the Treasury.\n25% of the profit that is generated through the use of strategies shall go to the Wonderland farm.\nProposer shall receive their percentage reward before allocating, when applicable.\nFarm allocations are also subject to redemption restrictions as per WIP 9 & 18.\n\nNote that profits are to be calculated on a quarterly basis and the relevant elected officials will decide the rate at which the amount allocated to the farm will be distributed to ensure more stable and sustainable returns.\n\nImplementation of TAP\nAt a minimum, the team should deploy an updated TAP once every quarter, whether market conditions have changed or not, in order to maintain a stable record and establish a regular pattern of communication in this area.\n\nIt is recommended to have the new TAP done following quarterly redemptions given how the treasury could be affected by it. However, regardless of the proximity to the previous or next quarterly TAP review, a new TAP can be deployed whenever the management team believes there is a need to change the current allocations (e.g. market conditions, potential investments, etc).\n\nCouncil Adjustments\nIn order to improve the farm’s balance or health, the treasury council may adjust the split internally by vote. Following the council vote, the Risk officer will make a final determination. The available governance processes may also be used if desired.\n\nBefore being put to a vote, the team should engage the community to gather feedback on the potential changes. If a vote is passed, the team should notify the DAO members as soon as practicable.\n\nIf an asset outside of cryptocurrency or digital assets is acquired the treasury-farm split will be determined on a case-by-case basis.\n\nBusiness requirements of the implementation of the proposal:\nNo special requirements are required to implement this proposal.",

Forum posts continue to have views even after they are closed. The 10% range would allow to compensate for those, but also give flexibility when engagement may slow down depending on market conditions.\nThe number of users required for the minimum requirement excludes users involved in the proposal. Comments, likes and/or poll votes can be used towards the quorum of users.\n\nPolls and official votes should always have an option to maintain the status quo.\nIn consultation with the delegated official1 , elected officials may bypass the DAO Discussion step when submitting a proposal. If the proposal goes against or in a different direction than an already voted proposal, the DAO Discussion should not be skipped.\n\nRFCs, WIPs and TMPs are to be reviewed and approved by the delegated official1 to ensure the proposals are clear, coherent and DAO guidelines followed. When submitted by the delegated official1 they must be reviewed by another elected official for approval.\n\nMinimum requirements will be calculated by the delegated official1 and a forum post will be updated regularly to keep the DAO informed.\n1Until voted otherwise, forum moderators and administrators will act as the delegated officials enforcing the framework.\n\nTreasury Management Proposal (TMP)\nA TMP is a request to alter specific parameters regarding the management of the treasury, renew previously approved budgets, or assist treasury personnel with decision making processes when required by previous governance such as WIP 14 and the current Treasury Allocation Proposal.\n\nThese proposals are to be formally voted on by the DAO. However, unlike a WIP, the TMP does not need to go through the complete governance process. A TMP should be posted by an elected official and should explain the reason for the TMP as well as the available options proposed to the DAO.\n\nDue to a TMP bypassing the regular governance process, there needs to be certain limits to prevent the mismanagement of the treasury funds by rushing the process.\n\t•\tA TMP should not be used to modify terms of previously voted WIP that are not directly related to treasury management or where the proposal did not allow that flexibility (e.g. liquid staking, redemption, $SIFU investment, etc).\n\t•\tA TMP should not be used for seed investments or buying specific tokens.\n\t◦\tA TMP could be used to ask the DAO to make a specific asset a strategic asset without voting on how much should be bought.\n\t◦\tA TMP could also be used if the purchase of the seed investment or specific tokens meets an established treasury guideline.\n\t•\tIn a situation where there is a conflict of interest with the proposer of a strategy, the regular governance process should be followed if the Risk Officer and the elected members voting on the proposed strategy believe further discussion is required to address the conflict.\n\t◦\tIn the event that the conflict of interest comes from the elected members voting on the proposed strategy or the Risk Officer, the strategy can be voted through a TMP.\n\nIf it is unclear whether a certain treasury management situation can be dealt with using a TMP, the guidelines should be clarified and the regular governance process used.\n\nRequirements of the implementation of the proposal:\nThere are limited requirements to implement this proposal.\nCurrent voting tool’s (Snapshot) settings will have to be adjusted. Moderators and elected officials will need to adjust to the new requirements. \n    ",

The first of which will include the development of sophisticated data visualization on treasury metrics for community and potential investors. After the treasury dashboard is completed we can help out with the dApp rework - however, the scope/timeline will be specified in a separate proposal. Multifarm will also offer joint marketing efforts.\nWe will showcase the productive assets in the treasury and optimize strategies around them, with that, providing clear stats on performance that can be shared with the community in the brand identity of Wonderland. Furthermore, the dashboard will transparently illustrate all the information around quarterly redemptions, providing investors with clear information on how to proceed.\n\nProvide Low-Level Details:\nDescribe more specifically individual components of the subject, focus on the details and present information in a structured way to help the community understand the proposal.\nDevelop a custom treasury dashboard\nMultifarm will take care of the full design, frontend, and backend development of the dashboard. After which, the management can easily be handed over to the Wonderland team. Any changes required can be made by the Wonderland team through an internal login. Mulitfarm can easily add any other features required in the future.\nThe development will follow 3 phases\nDesign Phase (1 week) (5k USD)\nDashboard Development - Frontend (1-2 weeks) (20k USD)\nDashboard Development - Backend (2 weeks) (25k USD)\nTotal: 50k USD - (4-5 Weeks)\nOffer co-marketing efforts.\nTwitter thread, Discord posts, AMAs, and Medium Articles, for example.\nWe believe in creating a long-lasting relationship with partners in the space and will endeavour to contribute to that relationship & spread awareness.\nHelping with dApp revamp\nRequires separate proposal\nFurther details included as a comment in the [DD] post\n\nSummary of the value proposition:\nEverything is listed in one place in full detail, including treasury assets, yield farming, strategies and wMEMO metrics. This benefits both the team and the community who can easily find the important information needed to make decisions related to treasury and governance.\n100% Transparency, enabling a more streamlined decentralized treasury management procedure\nImmediate overview of treasury use and transactions (important given that the majority of investors cannot read etherscan or blockchain).\nEducation for the Community (explaining concepts of wMEMO, Redemptions, liquid-/backing prices, etc.)\nAllows the community a deeper understanding of the protocol and its fundamentals\nRegular updated presentations of revenues/volumes/redemptions, etc.\nVisualization of the entire ecosystem around Wonderland\nClarity of returns from yield farming and other investments. With the help of Multifarm yield farming data feeds\n\nBusiness and/or technical requirements for the implementation of the proposal:\nMultifarm will hand over the control of the backend-login upon completion of the dashboard. We will provide the core team with a self-service login, so they can manage their strategies themselves. Our infrastructure is built on Kubernetes and hosted on AWS with very high up-time.\nFor any additional work, someone from the Multifarm team can do it on behalf of Wonderland (editing the strategies, adding more changes to the dashboard, etc.) and we can charge by the dev hour for anything required.\n\nPayment Terms:\nThe initial fee of $5,000 is charged upfront to cover the Design phase upfront. After which the remainder of $45,000, for the FE ($20,000) and BE ($25,000) phases, is invoiced on completion and delivery of the respective phases. Payment in MIM/USDC/DAI or any other stablecoin of preference.\nOnce Wonderland has a legal entity, we are happy to sign an SLA stating some more specifics about deliverables and costs in the agreement between Multifarm and Wonderland.",

      "title": "[WIP #22] - Defining Risk Officer and Adding Sifu as Interim",
      "content": "[WIP #22] Forum Post: https://wl-l.ink/forum/WIP/22-Risk-Officer\n\nScope:\n\nThis proposal formally defines and introduces a new role called Risk Officer (RO).\n\nObjective:\n\nThe main goal of this proposal is to improve the current treasury deployment process defined in WIP 15 by adding a Risk Officer to limit the DAO’s risk in all proposed fund allocations.\n\nHigh Level Overview:\n\nDeploying a treasury the size of Wonderland’s doesn’t come without risks. It is proposed to implement a Risk Officer position to ensure that Wonderland is not too heavily exposed to a particular protocol, directional, smart contract risk, or poorly vetted deal.\n\nLow Level Details:\n\nRisk Officer\n\nThis proposal introduces the role of Risk Officer to do due diligence on investments, directional exposure, and deployment of DAO funds into DeFi protocols.\n\nThis role requires a deep knowledge of DeFi. They are required to evaluate the risks of deployment into farms on a host of possible protocols, vet sourced deals, and other strategies. They should also be wary of Wonderland having too much exposure to any particular protocol or directional position.\n\nAll passed proposals from the Treasury Council are forwarded to this role for evaluation. After evaluating the strategy, the Risk Officer may submit the proposal to the multisig for execution, provide suggestions to reduce risk to what they deem acceptable (e.g. reduce sizing) and have the Treasury Council revote or veto and reject the idea if the risk is not deemed manageable.\n\nThe Risk Officer is not responsible for quality or profitability of investments or strategies nor provide advice on, but is in place to ensure safety and reduce risks for holders.\n\nAny applicant for the Risk Officer position should be invested into Wonderland and have a sizable portfolio (minimum 5 wMEMO), to limit bribes and ensure interests are aligned with the protocol. The Risk Officer should able to prove they have a deep knowledge of DeFi and be doxxed, or be a well known anon personality. The Risk Officer does not vote, nor participate in development of strategies.\n\nRemoval of the Risk Officer\n\nThe removal of a Risk Officer can be done through a regular DAO proposal or through the same process established in WIP 15 for Treasury Operators, if it is believed the Risk Officer is acting against the best interest of the protocol (e.g. RO not doing their job or abusing their authority).\n\nA majority vote from within the group of all treasury operators and elected moderation team is required to initiate such a vote.\nThe individual will have a minimum of 7 days to provide an argument for maintaining their position.\nA Snapshot Vote lasting 72 hours will settle the decision.\nTreasury Operators may not propose new strategies while there is no Risk Officer appointed. Managing current investments/strategies, farms, sales and DAO led investments can continue to be managed.\n\nCompensation\n\nThis is a high skill requirement role, but it should not be time consuming. Therefore a good salary, but not exorbitant is suggested: 20k per quarter paid in a reasonably pegged (>99.8%) stablecoin the treasury has available.\n\nBusiness and/or technical requirements:\n\nTo help with the current transition and ensure the Risk Officer Position is implemented and filled as soon as possible, it is proposed that Sifu is appointed as interim Risk Officer, without compensation, until a formal proposal to establish proper candidates is completed.\n\nElected Treasury Operators and other members of the Treasury Council will have to work with the Risk Officer to put in place a way to communicate efficiently.\n\nThe Risk Officer will also ensure that communication with the multisig is efficient.",

      "content": "Name: [WIP #20] - Treasury Advisor - yieldchad\n\nScope: The position of Treasury Advisor and the election of yieldchad to that position. This proposal also further includes risk disclosures.\n\nObjective: Finalize the role of Treasury Advisor, including: expectations, requirements, strategies, compensation, risks, and tenure.\n\nProvide a High Level Overview: Yieldchad was recently elected to Treasury Manager. However, in order to reduce liability for the treasury and for yieldchad himself, it was agreed that yieldchad would withdraw from the TM position, and instead apply for an advisory role.\n\nThe Role\n\nThe idea of the Treasury Advisor is simple - the TA will look after treasury operations and advise on how to deploy the capital, while the relevant DAO representatives (potentially the Treasury Committee as laid out in WIP 15) makes the ultimate decision on whether or not to invest. Ultimately, the TA is expected to develop and suggest investment strategies, protocol partnerships, and generally look after the wellbeing of the treasury.\n\nThe TA will submit monthly reports detailing strategies deployed by the Treasury.\n\nThe role of TA will be similar to that of Treasury Manager, with a few key differences:\n\nNot on the multisig\nNot an executive decision making role – the Treasury Advisor will make recommendations which the multisig will decide whether or not to execute\nThe TA will be expected to:\n\nSubmit investment proposals on a regular basis to ensure that the Treasury is deployed and earning returns\nMonitor existing strategies to ensure safety and performance\nWork with other protocols to scout partnership and unique investment opportunities with the Treasury\nWrite monthly reports on Treasury activity\nAlways fight for the best interests of wMEMO holders\nTenure\n\nThe TA will serve an initial term starting from the end of the snapshot vote (if elected) until 31 December 2022. If no proposal to replace or remove the TA is made by 15 December 2022, the Treasury Advisor’s term shall be renewed on a rolling basis thereafter for 6 month periods.\n\nIf the TA is deemed unnecessary by the community, the TA will resign before his tenure ends per the results of WIP voting to end his term early.\n\nFor further information, please read the full WIP here: https://www.wonderlandforum.xyz/t/wip-20-treasury-advisor-yieldchad/19333",

It can do this by diverting BTC and ETH to mint GLP, a token paying 15-20% yield on the GMX platform. For more information on GMX's GLP token, read the DAO Discussion and RFC (note especially the articles referenced in the DAO Discussion).\n\nBased on feedback, the ideal position size for GLP would be $12.5m in value, to keep our risk diversified. In future, Yieldchad's hedging strategies will ideally also hedge out more of the price-risk of this strategy.\n\nAs GLP is about 55:45 BTC/ETH:Stablecoins, minting GLP by using only BTC and ETH would reduce exposure to BTC and ETH (for e.g., if you exchange $1 in BTC for $0.50 BTC and $0.50 in Stablecoins, this reduces your exposure to BTC by half). Instead, Minting GLP using a mix of stablecoins and crypto would allow Wonderland to maintain the same exposure to BTC and ETH as it currently has. Whether or not Wonderland should maintain or lower its BTC/ETH exposure is also being voted on through options Yes (A) and Yes (B).\nSnapshot Details:\n\nThe outcome of this vote will not be decided based on which option attains a simple majority.\nInstead, note whether the sum of votes for the YES options exceeds the sum of votes for the NO option. If so, Wonderland will mint GLP.\nFrom there, consider which YES option was more popular and abide by that option.\nTo illustrate, if the vote is split 32-28-40 between YES (A), YES (B) and NO, it is YES (A) that wins the vote by the process above.",

It serves only to clarify sections of the original proposal and does not change the redemption process.\n\nHigh Level Overview\n* Add the explicit notion that the party in charge of redemption should look at minimizing the impact of assets being redeemed in the best interest of holders, redeemers and affected protocols.\n\n* Clarify how assets are to be distributed.\n\n* Modify some wording of the original proposal to reduce gaps and remove some of the confusions around “VC assets”.\n\n* Add a clause for periods where there is no Treasury Manager.\n\nLow Level Details\nFor reference: https://wl-l.ink/forum/WIP/9-redemption\n\nTo address the required clarifications, “Objective 3” of WIP 9 will be modified to the proposed text below:\n\n**\nObjective 3: Assets considered as part redemption.\nIlliquid assets, assets allocated to the revenue share farm, and a portion of seeds assets** will not be added to the redemption price per wMEMO.\n\nNo additional exit fees or penalties will be enacted or deducted from the redemption price.\n\nThe redemption price and assets allocated per wMEMO should be calculated based on the circulating supply of wMEMO. The distribution of seed assets allocated for the redemption should also be calculated based on the circulating supply of wMEMO. Both, the redemption price and the redeemable assets per wMEMO will be indicated in the redemption breakdown provided prior to the whitelist period.\n\nBefore adding an asset to be redeemed “as is”, the Treasury Manager will consider the consequences of doing so in order to preserve value and limit the impact that redeeming the asset may have on the holders, redeemers and the protocol. As an alternative, the affected protocol will be offered the opportunity to buy the assets eligible for redemption through an OTC trade at market price (with the possibility of negotiating a lower price) prior to the redemption period. If a deal cannot be reached the assets can be sold OTC to someone else, redeemed or the value-equivalent of the token can be added to the stable portion of the assets being redeemed.\n\nIn the event of an unforeseen situation or issue around assets not covered by the proposal, the Treasury Manager will use their discretion in an equitable fashion for holders and redeemers with an allowance of up to 25% of the asset redeemable.\n\n**The value of up to 25% of any seed assets that are considered liquid will be added to the redemption price. The final percentage allocated will be determined by the Treasury Manager and announced as part of the redemption price prior to the redemption period.\n\nSeed assets: For the purposes of Redemption, “seed assets” are defined as both liquid/illiquid assets generated from seed funding investment from the treasury To fall under “seed assets”, the investment does not require equity as a result. A Simple Agreement For Future Tokens (SAFT) investment would also qualify.\n**\n\nUsing the current investments as an example, the Betswap and Cross the Ages investments do fall under the “seed funding investment”, but the Sifu Vision investment does not.\n\nAdditionally, to ensure the continuity of redemptions, in the absence of a Treasury Manager, for all intent and purposes, the process will be managed by other elected representatives as per WIP 15.\n\n\nLink to previous discussions:\nhttps://wl-l.ink/forum/DD/Redemption-Amend-Clarification\nhttps://wl-l.ink/forum/RFC/Redemption-Amendment",

Keeping in mind that the profits to be gained while holding are by staking wMEMO in the farm for revenue share and from market price action.\n\nThe end the confusion, it’s proposed to stop the rebases.\n\nBusiness and/or technical requirements of the implementation of the proposal:\nThe Core Team will disable the rebases and update the dApp to ensure there is no confusion as the APY, Next Reward Amount/Yield and ROI (5-day), etc. will now be obsolete.\n\nUser should will still be able to stake TIME, but should not be able to unstake. Users should be wrapping their MEMO and use wMEMO instead.",

This is not a change in the payments themselves, but the scheduling of a one lump payment to be made if this WIP passes.\n\nNotes:\nThis Mod payment will not affect the the redemption value for WIP 9.\n\nProvide a High Level Overview:\nDespite the hurdles faced internally and horrific market conditions externally, I believe that they have been able to keep conditions here healthy enough to keep the project intact. I believe that they should be compensated beyond the contract - especially also in light that they had begun work in earnest in January.\n\nFor this, I firmly believe as a retroactive and incentive compensation the MOD team should receive 75,000 USDC to be distributed by Alice as judged appropriate.\n\nLooking forward, the team has significant work ahead and Wonderland depends on this. However, given the market conditions and overall global conditions for crypto - that a peace of mind is necessary and propose to pre-fund Mod pay for 6 months and held by Alice and payments from this would be at Alice’s discretion.\n\nNote that this payment will not affect the redemption level for Q2 2022.\n\nFurther, in the case that Wonderland is wound down prior to January 15th, 2023 then Alice will return the remaining funds less amount owed to the team for the work done but not yet paid.\n\nProvide Low Level Details:\nIf the proposal is passed, Wonderland will send USDC of the amount of 225,000 USDC to the Mod Avax Address.\n\nFrom August 15th to January 15th, 2023, no more monthly payments will be made as the 150,000 USDC pre-fund was sent.\n\nJuly 15th Schedule MIM payment of 25,000 MIM payment will not be affected and paid accordingly.\n\nPrevious Related Discussions:\nhttps://www.wonderlandforum.xyz/t/rfc-mod-compensation-amendment/18492\nhttps://www.wonderlandforum.xyz/t/dao-discussion-mod-compensation-amendment/18434/46\n",

Expectation of profits through this partnership with your founder. \n\n**High Level Overview:** $SIFU Vision was created by the founder of Wonderland as a solo act, continuing the vision that I originally had for Wonderland, without the friction of conflict of interest and DAO. We currently have ~2500 holders and an active discord featuring daily communication with the team. \n\n**Low Level Details:** If this proposal is passed, Wonderland will purchase $25MM worth of $SIFU tokens at the current backing price. These tokens will be placed into a Sablier stream on ETH chain, to be vested linearly over 12 months. This means a portion of the tokens are unlocked and made available to sell every block, evenly, over one year.",

      "content": "Link to Forum Discussion: https://www.wonderlandforum.xyz/t/wip-8-defining-danis-role-at-wonderland/18239\n\nScope:\n\nDaniele has continuously used his experience and expertise in DeFi to lead and push the protocol forward as well as grow and find investments that benefit the protocol. This proposal is an opportunity for the community to officially outline Daniele’s role and responsibilities at Wonderland. Daniele should continue to incorporate his ideas and vision of Wonderland with oversight of official community election.\n\nIn the spirit of becoming more organized as a DAO, and just as we officially voted in Sifu in [WIP #1], and later SkyHopper with clearly defined roles and responsibilities, so shall we vote for our leadership positions, including Daniele Sesta, as Co-Founder & Chief Strategist of Wonderland.\n\nObjective: Daniele Sesta’s role at Wonderland should be to benefit Wonderland. This proposal’s objective is to create a clear outline for Daniele’s role and responsibilities.\n\nProvide Low Level Details:\n\nDaniele’s Role and Responsibilities as Co-Founder & Chief Strategist:\n\n1. Continue in his leadership role as Chief Strategist of Wonderland\n\nDaniele is the co-founder of Wonderland and has played a significant role in growing the community, protocol, and treasury. With his extensive expertise and popularity in the DeFi space, continuing to use these skills to benefit Wonderland is of utmost importance. As Leader and chief strategist, we hold Daniele to a high standard and look towards his Leadership and Vision for Wonderland.\n\n2. Seek out investment opportunities beneficial for Wonderland and present them to the community and/or Treasury Manager.\n\nAs Co-founder and Chief Strategist, a core responsibility of Daniele is to seek out the very best investment opportunities for Wonderland and bring them forward to the treasury manager and community\n\nHowever, as outlined in [WIP #7], Daniele Sesta is to advise and strategize in conjunction with the elected Treasury Manager, SkyHopper. This includes NO unilateral usage of Wonderland treasury funds.\n\n2.1 Disagreement with Treasury Manager\nUse of the treasury should not be made without the Treasury Manager’s consent. In case of a disagreement with the Treasury Manager, if no compromise can be reached, further consultation should be done with the rest of the team members (if required) to ensure that the involved parties are not being unreasonable.\n\nWhen judged necessary, the situation may be brought in front of the DAO for final decision. However, any use of funds overruling the Treasury Manager’s objection should be reported to the DAO as soon as possible to implement corrective measures if required.\n\n3. Properly disclose and communicate potential conflict of interest to the team and community to ensure that decisions are not made at Wonderland’s expense.\n\nGiven Daniele’s unique position as one of the main decision maker in multiple protocols, it is important to properly disclose and consult with an impartial body on decisions that could be perceived as a conflict of interest. This would to limit the FUD and animosity that could result from such decisions. Decisions made on Wonderland’s behalf should be made in favor of Wonderland. In these situation, it is not enough to rely on intentions, it is necessary to manage the perception.\n\n4. Ensure/delegate to an elected official the responsibility and implementation of passed Wonderland Improvement Proposal.\n\nIn his leadership role, it is Daniele’s responsibility to ensure and/or delegate any Wonderland Improvement Proposal that passes and be implemented as soon as reasonably possible.\n\n5. Ensure/delegate to an elected official the responsibility to ensure plans and strategies are communicated to the community.\n\ni.e., Consistent and quality communication and coordination with elected Wonderland Moderators, Treasury Manager, Developers, and Community.\n\n6. Promote and coordinate potential collaborations within the Frog Nation ecosystem beneficial to Wonderland\n\nWith the future possibility of a merge and / or funding Abracadabra in the future, clear communication and coordination of any of the above is needed. As well as taken through the appropriate governance.\n\nBusiness and/or technical requirements of the implementation of the proposal:\n\nDefining Daniele’s role maintains the status quo and no changes need to be made",

      "title": "Remove the multisig and replace it with on-chain governance",
      "content": "Summary\nOver the past few days, it was made more clear than ever that Wonderland token holders lack any form of ownership or control over their treasury assets and the protocol. The fate of the protocol is left in the hands of a few multisig signers. This poses incredible risk especially in the light of some multisig signers signaling their intention to ignore the result of off-chain proposals and even going as far as announcing that “the DAO gonna be managed by [them] directly”.\n\nI propose the following:\n- Remove all assets and protocol privileges from under the multisig’s control\n- Move all treasury assets and protocol contracts to a GovernorApha on-chain governance implementation controlled directly by TIME / MEMO holders and their elected delegates\nProposed implementation plan\n1. Bridge all funds owned by the treasury on all chains to the multisig on Avax\n2. Deploy a new GovernorAlpha instance to Avax that allows TIME / MEMO holders to wrap their tokens in a new wrapped GovernorAlpha-compatible token\n3. Use one of the existing open source frontends for on-chain governance voting and delegation. Options include Uniswap, Inverse Finance, Tally or others\n4. Transfer all treasury funds and protocol contracts ownership to the GovernorAlpha timelock contract and remove all multisig privileges\n5. Each TIME / MEMO holder may vote directly on on-chain proposals or delegate their voting power to someone they trust to make proposals and vote on their behalf\nCall for collaborators\n\nDue to the severity of the recent events, the future of the Wonderland story and how it unfolds will be remembered as a turning point in the history of crypto. In my opinion, it is up to us all in the crypto community to do our part and make sure that it is remembered as a moment where we all stood together to ease the pains of the thousands of everyday people who are hurt by this situation and to find a viable solution that puts them back in control of their own future.\n\nOn behalf of the Inverse DAO core contributors, we’re willing to contribute anything we can to help complete this transition, including our code, our time and our experience in on-chain governance. All projects that have a history in implementing on-chain governance are also encouraged to pitch in with their knowledge and resources and collaborate on this proposal to save Wonderland holders.",

And why \n    did they decide to quit?\n2.\tDid you do an analysis or research about the consequences \n    regarding the result of Yes vs No?\n3.\tWas your action based on patronage emotion on Wonderland or \n    influenced or mislead by others?\n4.\tWere you provided with enough information about the pro / con on \n    the proposal?\n\nLet’s compare the pro / con about Continuing or Winding down Wonderland on your behalf.\n\nQ:  What does it mean Winding down?  \nA:  When a project is considered fail, the project would be winding down.  The stake holders will then be allocated with the funds from the treasury that they are entitled to.  In this case, Dani and Wonderland team declared the OHM Fork Wonderland is a failure experiment which should be closed and will give every wMEMO holder back the funds from the treasury.  \n\nQ:  How does Wonderland continue to operate without a development team?\nA:  Wonderland DAO Community need to look for proposals after proposals for the replacement of operation, management teams to take over.  \nQ:  How long will it take?\nA:  Normally, it will take about 6 months to implement a new functional team from planning, setting goals for actions, implementing, executing, controlling, monitoring and final post evaluation.\nQ:  Can you guarantee the experiment to be feasible?  \nA:  If you interview any submitted proposal drafter, I’m sure they can’t guarantee either.  They will add a contract clause – if the project experiment fail, the project will be closed; the treasury will be given back to the holders.   Then why you want to waste 6 months to receive a “possibility of maybe”.  Those team are not charity organizations, they charged about 5% of your revenue.  \n\nConclusion:\n\nMany of you frogs are long holders and dreamers from very early stage of Wonderland project. \nWhat does your investment mean to you?  \nDo you really want to allow your lifeblood to feed some other unknown experiments, or should you call it a stop right now?  \nIs it a right thing to do?  Yes, you should choose the best interest of yours in terms of investment.  \n",

      "title": "Rage Quit Option",
      "content": "After today's AMA things are starting to look up. But the most important takeaway is that there are outstanding issues. Let's break these problems down into their individual components and try solve them bit by bit. Here we will focus on the rage quit option.\n\nThe voting options on this proposal will be designed to force people to read and understand for themselves. One of the biggest problems we all face right now. So please, once you have done the reading, don't go giving people a TLDR to try force them to vote with you. Every person should make their own decision.\n\n- What is the Rage Quit Option? \nBasically, it would be an option to allow wMEMO holders to swap their tokens directly with the treasury for the corresponding amount of assets at the backing value per wMEMO.\n\n- Why is it important?\nEven though some of us have undying loyalty for Dani and his projects no matter what, the fact of the matter is that he made some mistakes that in the eyes of many others is not excusable. They have lost faith in the project, they want out and for that we cannot blame them. These are the same people who will be most likely to hold the project back in the future because they don't want to be involved, they feel forced/trapped to HODL, and that will inevitably be bad for the community and our progress. So it is important to give these people the option to leave so that we can all focus on up only in the future. No holdbacks.\n\n- How can this be done without hurting the frogs who are still HODLing?\nI came across this Medium article (https://medium.com/@beeDgee/can-frogs-exiting-at-backing-bank-run-for-wonderland-a-potential-path-forward-99dfdcaa4871) that I think people should read. It explains the impact to the treasury in numbers and proves that it won't be as bad as people think.\nThough I would still suggest doing things a little differently than in the medium article:\n\n\n- The proposal\n1. Take a snapshot once this vote closes (this keeps it most fair for everyone) to determine who is eligible for the Rage Quit option, only holders of wMEMO before snapshot will be eligible. This accounts for frogs who may have panick sold at all time lows and allows them time to buy back in if their original intent was always to exit at backing regardless.\n2. Have the Rage Quit option be available during Saturday Feb 5th and Sunday Feb 6th, 2022 (UTC) to allow people a fair chance at exiting.\n3. For the duration of the Rage Quit, from start to close, remove ALL wMEMO-MIM liquidity from Sushi so that trading is effectively paused.\n4. All the wMEMO that is collected by the treasury from those who exit should be kept in a pool. All the wMEMO from people who Rage Quit then gets distributed proportionately back to all the wMEMO holders who remain after the Rage Quit period has closed. This way if half the people choose to rage quit - every single remaining wMEMO holder will basically double their position in wMEMO. This will effectively make up for any loss in treasury assets and decrease in backing per wMEMO. Because remaining holders will basically have more wMEMO despite the backing being proportionately lower. I think this is a great option because it will, in my opinion, really reward the most loyal holders most. I believe that Dani and team will get this project to be successful again and grow the treasury way past its previous highs. If that were to happen after people Rage Quit and give us their wMEMO, not only would the backing price surpass its current level but those of us remaining would all be HODLing much more wMEMO without having to pay for it. \n\n\nI think I can see a way forward here where mostly everyone can get what they want. Those who lost faith and wanna exit can exit, but they will be lining our pockets with more wMEMO by doing so. And will basically be rekking themselves when Wonderland rises up again. And at the same time, the traders and price manipulators won't play a role since during the rage quit option there will be zero wMEMO-MIM liquidity to trade.\n\nThere are still more issues ahead, but let's focus on one thing at a time. Please understand the advantages/disadvantages of each voting option for yourselves and vote knowing that you made this decision for yourself. Thanks for reading!\n\n\n\n",

      "title": "Resume Steady Buybacks below backing",
      "content": "As an investment DAO we are always looking for new investments, if we knew for a fact a company or token was valued at say, 700M (Our treasury value), but it was offered to us for 450M (our market value)... it would be a great investment. That is exactly the opportunity that we have by doing buybacks again! \n\nLast time, from what I saw we were doing large buybacks all at once, but I believe that is completely wrong. It wastes money on slippage and incentivizes selling for a quick buck. Instead, we should be steadily purchasing, in $10,000-$50,000 increments of Wmemo and BURNING it with the treasury funds. This may seem counterintuitive, however, this is the superior way to handle the redistribution question for a couple reasons. \n\n1. It allows the market to set a penalty to exit the treasury early, and the entire penalty is distributed to the people who remain in the pool. A quick example to illustrate that point:\n\n10 people hold 1 wmemo each which represent 1 cookie, but the market currently values the cookies at half a cookie, and the cookie treasury holds 10 cookies.  If the cookie treasury decides to buy back a cookie from one of the holders, there will be 9 holders left, but 9.5 cookies left, now everyone has access to 1.055 cookies. \n\n2. The slow purchase will mean if you want to capture the benefits you will have to hold longer, as opposed to large purchase where you can exit and capture that benefit immediately. \n\n3. It benefits the treasury and the holders in the longterm for the price to stay below backing if we do slow buybacks, take the example I gave above, if we keep running that until only a couple of people are remaining, they have an enormous share of the cookie pie all of a sudden. The frogs who remain the longest should be the ones who get to eat all the cookies at the end. \n\n\nI believe we should not do buybacks once we are above 90% backing, as the reward is smaller for the treasury and it can always purchase at a lower price. The exact amounts of buybacks per day should be considered by the treasury manager, but it should not be too large, or too small, as the goal is to do a steady purchase plan, reasonably our treasury could support multiple millions of dollars in purchasing per day until we are at the target price and we can resume investments. \n\nSome other Misc reasons to resume buybacks: \n\n\n1. It is one of the safest way to deploy treasury funds, after all, every time the treasury buys and burns it's making us all a profit at the eventual redemption price. \n\n2. Buybacks and trading in general creates fees for the protocol\n\n\n\n\n\n",

      "content": "Dear Frogs,\n \nWith the help of the frogs community Defi Edge and others please read a new proposal.  Wonderland with the current structure model was able to attract 1 billion $ of treasury funds and to earn 1 million $ per day for the treasury growth.\n \nMoving to a revenue sharing model will let all holders benefit from the treasury.  But due to the utility of wMEMO to be able to use as collateral, has caused multiple liquidation cascades, if wales dump wMEMO.  The problem with the rebase model has obviously failed, additionally to the liquidation cascades.  \n\nEvery user could have jump into MEMO right before the rebase and sell the tokens immediately, which has caused a depreciation of the price of wMEMO  The possible solution could be moving from rebase model to revenue share.  wMEMO won’t be used as collateral anymore.\n\nThere is no other protocol in this space available yet, with the utility to have a fund with a revenue sharing model.  There is no other project out there which could compete with Wonderland, if we bring it to the right track again.  The treasury is healthy and ready for a new CFO to take over.  The community will vote for the next best CFO.  Improve the treasury to make it more efficient.  It is earning about 1 million $ per day at the moment.  It will earn much more for us holders if we let it continue to work for us.\n \nPlease take a snapshot of the time/wmemo holders before the Sifu news and Daniele wallets were liquidated.  Wallets bought time/wmemo after the liquidation cannot vote.  Lock the treasury fund until  a new team takes full responsibility for the frog nation.\n \nMaybe Wonderland could have access to abracadabra funds to create the biggest defi fund on this planet.  \n\nAlone we are strong together we are stronger!  \n\n\n\n\n",

      "content": "Link to [WIP #2] post:\nhttps://www.wonderlandforum.xyz/t/wip-2-build-avalanche-liquid-staking-for-wonderland/4682\n\nScope:\nBuild and launch a fully fledged Liquid Staking Solution on Avalanche and afterwards on Fantom, to democratize staking and create additional income streams for Wonderland in this market.\n\nObjective:\nDiversify Wonderland treasury revenue streams by adding liquid staking to our portfolio, in line with Dani’s 2022 vision for the Frog Nation 🐸 ✊\n\nProvide a High Level Overview:\n🚨 We strongly recommend reading the RFC discussion and DAO discussion posts in their original context (with rich formatting) to see how these proposals have evolved:\n\nLink to [RFC] post:\nhttps://www.wonderlandforum.xyz/t/rfc-build-avalanche-liquid-staking-for-wonderland/4301\n\nLink to [DAO Discussion] post:\nhttps://www.wonderlandforum.xyz/t/dao-discussion-avalanche-liquid-staking-proposal/3729\n\nFrog Nation is growing rapidly: Popsicle Finance is launching on Polygon, and there are proposals on the Abracadabra forum to expand to Harmony and Polygon. Andre and Dani tease us daily about Fantom; Sushi is coming to Avalanche with the charge led by frogs; and we have the upcoming launch of the sports betting platform.\n\nIt’s been a wild ride the last few months, but it’s nothing compared to what 2022 holds in terms of growth and diversification for every frog lucky enough to be here. We consider ourselves among them, which is why we are excited to see how liquid staking fits into Dani’s vision:\n\nhttps://twitter.com/danielesesta/status/1476261740178518021\n\nAs proof of stake chains grow (and new ones launch every day), liquid staking becomes an even more critical base component to keep capital flowing while also maintaining democratisation of these chains.\n\nProvide Low Level Details:\n• Avalanche’s staking TVL is over $12B. Staking requires a minimum staking period of two weeks and a minimum staked amount of 2,000 AVAX for a validator (at current prices around $200k USD) or 25 AVAX for delegation.\n• Staked AVAX is illiquid until unstaked. Creating a protocol to free up the liquidity users would normally have locked up in staking will help DeFi on Avalanche to boom even more.\n• The annual staking reward on Avalanche is 9.82%. Based on Avalanche’s current market cap of $25.7B, the total addressable market for staking is roughly $2.5B per year.\n• Lido, one of the largest liquid staking solutions, offers liquid staking on both the Terra and Ethereum chains (but not Avalanche). Adoption is currently 17.6% and 13.4% of staking users respectively.\n• If we can capture 5% of the total addressable AVAX staking market (approximately 8% of existing staked supply), this means gross staking rewards of $125M per year.\n• If Wonderland take a 10% fee for running the liquid staking service, Wonderland’s gross revenue would be $12.5M per year.\n• At a more aggressive market share, 20% of the addressable market, Wonderland’s corresponding gross revenue would stand at $50M per year.\n\nBusiness and/or technical requirements of the implementation of the proposal:\n\nBreakdown of the timeline:\n• ✅ Research: Q3-Q4 2021\n• ✅ Initial technical specification: Q4 2021\n• 🚀 Protocol development: Q4 2021-Q1 2022\n• Fuji testnet deployment and audit: February 2022\n• Mainnet deployment: March 2022\n• Avalanche protocol development: March 2022 onwards\n• Maintenance, improvements, upgrades, and support: ongoing\n• Protocol development for Fantom 👻\n\nMore technical details of the project can be found in the original proposal in the DAO discussion:\nhttps://www.wonderlandforum.xyz/t/dao-discussion-avalanche-liquid-staking-proposal/3729\n\nCompensation structure to deliver a fully fledged liquid staking solution:\n• $1 million MIM up front as a retainer and for development costs\n• $2 million MIM on delivery\n• $1 million MIM at 1% market share\n• $1 million MIM at 2.5% market share\n• $1 million MIM at 5% market share\n\nRevenue Share for the development team:\n• 25% revenue share for the first year\n• 20% revenue share for the second year\n• 15% revenue share for each year thereafter\n\nThe liquid staking solution assumes a 90:10 split of staking rewards between users and Wonderland DAO. As the bulk of the team’s revenue now arises from revenue share, we propose that it not fall below 2.5% of total staking reward, to protect the team’s downside risk if the DAO chooses to reduce its reward share below this 90:10 split.",

This proposal is an opportunity for the community to decide whether Sifu should continue to incorporate his ideas and vision of Wonderland and manage the treasury with oversight of the multisig or if Sifu should be replaced.\n\nLink to previous [DAO Discussion] and [RFC] thread:\n[DAO Discussion] - Continued Treasury Management by Sifu\nhttps://www.wonderlandforum.xyz/t/dao-discussion-continued-treasury-management-by-sifu/1631\n[RFC] - Continued Treasury Management by Sifu\nhttps://www.wonderlandforum.xyz/t/rfc-continued-treasury-management-by-sifu/2153\n\nObjective:\nAllow the DAO to make the decision if treasury management needs to be changed.\n\nProvide a High Level Overview:\nThe treasury is the foundation of Wonderland and with its nearly $2B USD valuation it becomes a powerful tool to benefit from DeFi opportunities, acquisitions, product launches and liquidity provisioning.\nSifu has been extremely professional and competent in guiding the protocol and managing the treasury.\nBy continuing to give Sifu full autonomy over changes to code and treasury management, the long term roadmap and the strategy around the treasury remains intact.\n\nProvide Low Level Details:\nSifu is the co founder of Wonderland and has played a significant role in growing the community, protocol and treasury. With the oversight of the multisig, Sifu was able to persistently identify high value stablecoin farms throughout the ecosystem. Recent decisions on switching TIME/AVAX pairs to TIME/MIM has helped secure profits as well as continue to keep liquidity for the TIME pair high. Additionally, Sifu has managed to lock voting power for the recent CVX purchase at more than double the APR that everyone else would be receiving, working hand in hand with the overall stablecoin farming strategy.\n\nBusiness and/or technical requirements of the implementation of the proposal:\nKeeping Sifu maintains the status quo and no changes need to be made.\nIf a replacement is desired, a transitory period needs to be announced which focuses on obtaining new candidates for the community to vote on.",
