      "title": "[GP30] From Galxe to Gravity - G Tokenomics Proposal",
      "content": "## **Abstract**\n\nThis proposal aims to implement a strategic change in the tokenomics of the Galxe ecosystem by transitioning the current GAL token to a newly named Gravity token (symbol: G). Following the successful passing of Proposal GP25, this transition will involve converting GAL to G tokens at a 1:60 ratio, resulting in a total supply increase to 12,000,000,000 G tokens. Additionally, the G token will introduce new utilities to enhance the functionality and security of the Gravity chain.\n\nG token will continue to be the utility token for Galxe products. Existing token utilities will be migrated from GAL to G, and additional token utilities will be introduced further.\n\n## **Motivation**\n\nThe transition from GAL to G tokens is motivated by a desire to expand the utility and scope of the token within the Galxe ecosystem. By renaming the token to Gravity and introducing a higher supply, we aim to improve liquidity and accessibility while also aligning the token's brand with its expanded role in the ecosystem. The added utilities of serving as a gas token and a native token for the Proof-of-Stake (PoS) algorithm will further solidify the G token's integral role in the Gravity chain, enhancing the overall value proposition for users and stakeholders.\n\n## **Specification**\n\n### **Overview**\n\nThe G tokenomics proposal outlines the following key changes and additions:\n\n- **Token Migration:** Transition from GAL to G tokens at a 1:60 conversion ratio.\n- **Total Supply:** Increase the total supply of G tokens to 12,000,000,000.\n- **Utilities to be migrated from GAL:**\n    - Utility token for Galxe Quest\n        - Smart Balance\n        - Space Creation Deposit\n    - Payment token in Galxe product suites\n    - Governance token for both Gravity and Galxe\n    - Exclusive airdrop (to be upgraded from GAL Staking)\n- **New Utilities:**\n    - G token as the gas token for the Gravity chain.\n    - G token as the native token for the Proof of Stake securing the Gravity chain.\n\n### **Scope**\n\nThis proposal covers:\n\n- The technical steps required for the token conversion process.\n- Adjustments to the total supply of tokens in circulation.\n- Implementation of the G token’s additional utilities.\n\n### **Success Criteria**\n\nThe success of this proposal will be determined by:\n\n- Seamless migration of all existing GAL tokens to G tokens at the specified ratio.\n- Successful integration of the G token’s new utilities into the Gravity chain.\n- Positive feedback and adoption from the Galxe community and stakeholders.\n\n### **Timeline**\n\n- **Phase 1:** Preparation\n    - Finalize technical aspects of the token conversion.\n    - Update all relevant documentation and communication materials.\n- **Phase 2:** Implementation\n    - Execute the token migration process.\n    - Integrate new utilities into the Gravity chain.\n- **Phase 3:** Monitoring and Support\n    - Monitor the transition and address any issues.\n    - Provide support to the community during the transition period.\n\n### **Budget:**\n\nN/A\n\n### **References**\n\n[[GP25] Token Symbol and Token Contract Migration - from GAL to G](https://snapshot.org/#/gal.eth/proposal/0x8d3f386c3b0cb9fa170d4231c65f18bd45ea1402b90a70116e1101c22e62ed01)",

      "content": "Empower the Galxe community by renaming the extension and adding new features to “Galxe Quests Assistant,” a Google Chrome extension designed to optimize user participation in Galxe Quests using the Galxe Protocol.\n\n### Abstract\nI propose to rename the “Galxe Raffle Tracker” extension to “Galxe Quests Assistant” and expand its capabilities. The new extension will still allow users to track their participation, view victories, and access quests, but on a larger scale that includes all Galxe-related activities. This change will provide a more integrated and interactive experience within the Galxe ecosystem using the Galxe protocol.\n\n### Motivation\nThe Galxe ecosystem thrives due to active participation in various quests. The original Galxe Raffle Tracker solved the problem of tracking participation and winnings. My proposal for the new “Galxe Quest Helper” aims to expand its functionality to include all quests from the spaces the user is subscribed to, thereby improving the user experience.\n\n### Review\nThe proposed “Galxe Quests Assistant” extension will offer the following features:\n\n- Track user quests\nDisplay all user quests, grouped by type of affiliation and sorted by time.\nProvide users with the ability to track their participation in raffles and other community events.\n- Direct access to active quests\nProvide direct links to active quests, simplifying the participation process.\n- Notification system\nNotify users of new quests and raffle victories, ensuring they never miss out on an opportunity.\n- User-friendly interface\nSeamless integration with the Galxe ecosystem through an updated and intuitive user interface.\n\n### Volume\nThe project involves renaming and improving “Galxe Raffle Tracker” into a “Galxe Quests Assistant” extension for Google Chrome. It includes:\n- User interface\nUpdate the interface to reflect the new functionality.\n- Backend integration:\nKeep server in sync with the Galxe Protocol while expanding functionality.\n- Notification system:\nImplement notifications about victories and new quests.\n- Testing and optimization:\nTest and optimize the extension for user convenience.\n\n### Success criterion:\n\n#### Effective quest tracking\nSuccessfully track user engagement and wins across the Galxe ecosystem.\n#### Increased user engagement\nIncrease user engagement and interaction with improved functionality.\n\n#### Positive feedback from the community\nReceive positive feedback from the Galxe community regarding the usability and functionality of the new extension.\n\n### Timeline/Budget\nThe planned development period will be 1 month and will be carried out as follows:\n\nWeek 1-2: Research and Design Phase.\nWeek 3-5: Development and backend integration.\nWeek 5-8: Testing, Debugging and Deployment.\nThe estimated budget for this project is 2500 GAL tokens, covering development, design, testing and deployment costs.\n\n### Conclusion\nRenaming and enhancing the extension to “Galxe Quests Assistant” represents a significant step towards enriching the Galxe community experience. By providing a tool that encompasses all user participation, I aim to increase engagement, promote community growth, and support the vitality of the ecosystem. I invite the Galxe community to support this proposal, moving towards a more interactive and user-centric experience in the Galxe ecosystem.",

      "title": "[GP27] Transitioning to Stake-Based Voting in GAL ",
      "content": "## Abstract\n\nThis proposal suggests a transition from allowing all GAL holders to vote on proposals within the DAO to permitting only those who have staked GAL to participate in the voting process. The objective is to enhance DAO member engagement and ensure that decision-making aligns more closely with the longer-term vision of the community and Galxe ecosystem.\n\n## Motivation\n\nCurrently, all GAL holders can vote on proposals within the DAO, regardless of their level of involvement or commitment to the ecosystem. This approach may not necessarily reflect the sentiments or interests of those who are most actively engaged in the project. By restricting voting rights to staked GAL, we aim to ensure that decisions are made by individuals who have a vested interest in the success and sustainability of the ecosystem. This shift will likely result in more informed and thoughtful decision-making processes, ultimately benefiting the entire community.\n\n## Specification\n\n### Overview\n\nThe proposed change involves modifying the DAO's voting mechanism to allow only users who have staked GAL to participate in voting on proposals. This would require adjustments to the existing voting mechanism governing the DAO's operations.\n\n### Scope\n\nThe scope of this proposal includes:\n\n1. Change the voting mechanism in Snapshot.\n2. Preparing the voting power/standard instruction.\n\n### Success Criteria\n\nThe success of this proposal will be evaluated based on:\n\n1. Increased engagement and participation in the voting process by stakeholders who have staked GAL.\n2. Improved alignment between decision-making within the DAO and the long-term vision of the community.\n3. Positive feedback and support from the majority of the community members regarding the new voting mechanism.\n\n### Timeline/Budget\n\nIt will be immediately implemented once the proposal is passed.\n\n### References\n\nhttps://dao-forum.galxe.com/t/galxe-dao-governance-process/15",

      "title": "[GP25] Token Symbol and Token Contract Migration - from GAL to G",
      "content": "Author: [stevenlei](https://dao-forum.galxe.com/u/stevenlei)\n\n## Abstract:\n\nIn response to evolving market dynamics and community feedback, this proposal presents a strategic initiative to upgrade GAL’s existing token smart contract. This proposal also suggests transitioning the token symbol from GAL to G within the Galxe ecosystem. I believe the proposed changes are needed in order for GAL to strengthen its brand identity, eliminate confusion in the crypto marketplace, and bolster community engagement. If this proposal were to be adopted by the community, the Galxe team would be incentivized to work with various constituents within the Galxe ecosystem to come up with a comprehensive plan detailing timelines, technical roadmaps, and adjustments to tokenomics.\n\n## Motivation:\n\nThe motivation for proposing this initiative is driven by both strategic imperatives and market considerations applicable to the Galxe ecosystem:\n\n- **Simplified Brand Identity:** Adopting a single-letter symbol, 'G', is grounded in the aspiration for a more streamlined and instantly recognizable brand presence. By embracing this simplicity, it could enhance the community’s visibility and differentiate Galxe amidst a crowded digital asset landscape.\n\n- **Resolving Brand Confusion:** The current token symbol, GAL, creates confusion among stakeholders, leads to potential misassociations and transactional errors. Transitioning to 'G' would represent a definitive step towards clarity, reducing the likelihood of brand dilution and enhancing user experience.\n\n- **Community and Market Clarity:** Cohesive branding is key to fostering a sense of belonging and trust. By adopting a distinct token symbol, it would strengthen a distinct sense of belonging amongst all community members while facilitating the onboarding of new participants across diverse platforms and web3 experiences.\n\n- **Preparation for Future Growth:** I believe that updating the token symbol reflects a proactive stance towards aligning the ecosystem’s branding strategy with future expansions and integrations within the crypto space. This includes, with the community’s approval, potential tokenomics changes and adapting for future utilities.\n\n## Specification:\n\n### **Overview:**\n\nThe proposed upgrade includes comprehensive modifications to the existing token smart contract and adoption of a new token symbol, 'G'. These changes are proposed to achieve a paradigm shift in the community’s brand identity and market positioning.\n\n### **Scope:**\n\nThis initiative encompasses a spectrum of technical enhancements, coordination efforts with strategic ecosystem members, and planning to ensure a smooth transition process. Key aspects include codebase modifications, tokenomics adjustments, and communication strategies tailored to diverse stakeholder groups.\n\n### **Success Criteria:**\n\nThe success of this proposal can be measured through tangible metrics such as improved brand recognition, heightened market visibility, reduced instances of brand confusion, and enhanced community engagement.\n\n### **Timeline/Budget:**\n\nIf this proposal were to be approved, a roadmap detailed the phased implementation of the token symbol change and smart contract upgrade would be defined, designed, and implemented by members of the community. Working with community members participating in the proposal is crucial to ensure that technical development roadmap, marketing initiatives, and stakeholder engagement are transparently communicated within the Galxe ecosystem.\n\n### References:\n\nN/A\n\n### Comments from Galxe Team:\n\nGalxe Team has reviewed this proposal and suggested to add the following additions:\n\n- Converting the GAL token to G token on a 1:60 basis. Meaning every 1 GAL token will grant the holder 60 G tokens.\n- The total supply of G token will be changed to 12,000,000,000 tokens, which is a 60x multiplier of the current total GAL token total supply of 200,000,000.",

Galxe Raffle Tracker aims to alleviate this problem by providing users with a web3 platform to easily track their activity, thereby improving the user experience, encouraging greater participation and helping to create a more cohesive community.\n\n### Review:\nThe proposed Galxe raffle tracker will offer the following features:\n\n- Track winnings and participation in raffles in real time.\n- Direct links to active campaigns, simplifying the participation process.\n- Notifications about new campaigns and wins, ensuring users never miss an opportunity.\n- User-friendly interface that easily integrates with the Galxe ecosystem.\n\n### Volume:\nThe project includes the development of Galxe Raffle Tracker as a Google Chrome extension. It includes:\n\n- The interface design matches the visual style of Galxe.\n- Development of a backend for data synchronization with the Galxe platform.\n- Implementation of notification systems for winnings and new campaigns.\n- Testing and optimization for user convenience.\n\n### Success Criteria:\n\n- Effectively track user participation and winnings in Galxe raffles.\n- Increased user engagement and interaction in the Galxe ecosystem.\n- Positive feedback from the Galxe community regarding the usability and functionality of the extension.\n\n\n### Time frame/budget:\nThe development period is predicted to be 1 month and is distributed as follows:\n\n- Week 1: Research and design phase.\n- Week 2-3: Development and backend integration.\n- Week 4: Testing, Debugging and Deployment.\nThe estimated budget for this project is 1000 in GAL tokens, covering development, design, testing and deployment costs.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe Galxe Raffle Tracker extension for Chrome represents a significant step towards enriching the Galxe community experience. By providing a tool that makes it easy to participate in campaigns and track wins, we aim to increase engagement, promote community growth, and support the vitality of the entire ecosystem. This proposal invites the Galxe community to support the development of the Galxe Raffle Tracker, marking a move towards a more interactive and user-centric experience in the Galxe ecosystem.\n\n![WX20240323-210219.png](ipfs://bafybeidv2trjf2zqydsb6jrqbme2j67cxdglceumfclsjch5gvb4x2qjne)",

      "content": "### Abstract\nThis proposal aims to enhance the liquidity of GAL/USDC pair specifically on Uniswap by allocating 1,800,000 GAL tokens from the DAO treasury. Of this, a portion of GAL will be diversified into USDC, with the remainder added to liquidity alongside the USDC on Uniswap V3. This initiative is designed to increase liquidity, promote on-chain trading of GAL, while mitigating any GAL price impact via strategic conversion of GAL to USDC via trusted OTC partners.\n\n### Specification\n#### Overview\nThis proposal details the allocation of 1,800,000 GAL tokens for liquidity provision on Uniswap.

      "title": "[GP18] Galxe 2024 Ecosystem & Marketing Growth Budget Proposal",
      "content": "### Abstract\nThis proposal outlines the allocation and management of the 750k GAL tokens budget for the year 2024, focusing on advancing Galxe’s growth and sustainability. The budget is strategically divided into four primary categories: Conferences and Events, General Marketing Expenses, Rewards and Incentives, and Other Ecosystem Expenses. This structured allocation aims to bolster Galxe’s market presence, community engagement, and ecosystem growth while maintaining fiscal responsibility.\n\n### Motivation\nReflecting on the remarkable achievements of Galxe in 2023, where we experienced significant strides in user engagement, technological advancements, and ecosystem expansion, we are poised to build on this momentum. Last year’s successes, marked by substantial growth in our user base, impressive partnership formations, and groundbreaking product innovations, have laid a solid foundation for future endeavors.\n\nThe 2024 budget proposal is crafted with the intention of capitalizing on these triumphs, aimed at propelling Galxe into new heights of success and recognition in the Web3 space. Our proposed allocation is a strategic continuation of the proven approaches of the past year, while also introducing novel initiatives to adapt to the evolving landscape.\n\nThis budget is designed not only to sustain the growth trajectory we set in 2023 but to accelerate it.\n\n### Specification\n#### Overview\nThe budget allocation is meticulously crafted to support comprehensive growth and engagement strategies. It addresses the need for a strong market presence, community incentives, and sustainable ecosystem development.\n\n#### Scope\n1. **General Marketing Expenses**: Drive brand awareness and user acquisition.\n2. **Rewards and Incentives**: Engage and retain community members.\n3. **Conferences and Events**: Facilitate knowledge sharing, networking, and brand exposure.\n4. **Other Ecosystem Expenses**: Support operational costs and miscellaneous strategic initiatives.\n#### Success Criteria\n- **Increased brand visibility and market share.**\n  * Increase in brand awareness\n  * Increase in media and publicity coverage (PR news, articles, etc)\n  * Enhanced reach of key news, updates and announcements\n  * Side events, panels\n  * Booths in a variety of conferences\n- **Enhanced community engagement and retention.**\n  * Increase in active community members\n  * Improved engagement metrics\n  * Community events participation\n  * Community retention rate improvement\n- **Measurable growth in ecosystem partnerships and collaborations.**\n  * Iconic Events Exposures (e.g. Token 2049, Binance Blockchain Week, Consensus, etc)\n  * Increase in VIP ecosystem partnerships\n  * Increase in joint initiatives with Galxe partners\n  * Hackathon collaborations with ecosystem partners\n\n#### Timeline/Budget\nTotal budget: 750k GAL tokens\n\n- **General Marketing Expenses - 20%**\n  * PR costs\n  * Digital Advertising\n  * Regional Agency Partnerships\n- **Rewards and Incentives - 30%**\n  * Ecosystem Rewards\n  * Ecosystem Incentives\n  * End of the Year Festival\n- **Conferences and Events - 35%**\n  * Conferences/Events fees\n    * Conferences Booths\n    * Side Events\n    * Event Sponsorships\n    * Workshops\n    * Organizational and travel expenses\n  * Global Events\n    * Event Remote Sponsorship\n- **Ecosystem Expenses - 10%**\n  * Ecosystem operations\n  * Ecosystem partnerships\n- **Allowance - 5%**\n  * Redundant Budget (to be allocated to any of the criteria in case of insufficient budget)\n\nThe GAL tokens allocated for this initiative will be transacted over-the-counter (OTC), ensuring that their sale does not impact the market price and maintains market stability. Any unused funds will be rotated into the next year’s ecosystem and marketing growth budget.\n\nTo underscore our commitment to transparency and accountability, we will conclude the year 2024 with a detailed report on the success and outcomes of this budget proposal. This report will provide a thorough analysis of how the funds were allocated and utilized, along with an evaluation of the achievements against the set objectives and success criteria.",

      "content": "## Abstract\nMoso, a platform incentivizing online shopping with crypto rewards, proposes a collaboration with Galxe. This partnership aims to integrate a white-labeled version of Moso’s site into Galxe’s ecosystem, enabling Galxe users to earn GAL tokens at enhanced rates. We request an allocation of 50,000 GAL tokens from the Galxe DAO to amplify reward rates by up to 5x, reaching 100% at selected merchants. This initiative will waive Moso’s usual 10% token fee for the initial roll-out, distributing the entirety of the 50,000 tokens directly to users as shopping rewards.\n\n## Motivation\n\nThe collaboration offers a multi-faceted value proposition:\n* New Capital Inflows: Every purchase via the white-labeled platform converts fiat to GAL tokens, increasing demand and liquidity.\n* Enhanced Token Utility: Integrating Moso’s service extends the use cases for GAL, enhancing its overall token utility.\n* Market Leadership: By offering up to 100% back on purchases, Galxe will become the prime destination for crypto-based online shopping rewards. This will open the door for a whole new cohort of online shoppers being introduced to the Galxe ecosystem.\n* Community Engagement: Generous reward incentives drive community growth and engagement within the Galxe ecosystem.\n\n## Specification\n### Overview\nThe integration encompasses a Moso-powered shopping portal on Galxe’s platform, offering an exclusive reward rate in GAL tokens. The 50,000 GAL tokens will serve as a reward multiplier for Galxe users, promoting the new service and increasing platform engagement.\n\n### Scope\nCustomization of Moso’s platform to align with Galxe branding and tokenomics.\nDevelopment of an exclusive reward rate structure for Galxe users.\nImplementation of promotional campaigns to highlight the increased reward rates.\n\n### Success Criteria\n* Completion of a seamless white-labeled platform within Galxe’s ecosystem.\nDistribution of 50,000 $GAL tokens to users as shopping rewards within the first quarter post-launch.\n* Demonstration of increased $GAL token volume and liquidity post-integration.\n\n### Timeline/Budget\n* Development and Integration: Development and integration are to be completed between Dec 15th to Jan 31st.\n* Budget: 50,000 GAL tokens for user rewards, with operational costs absorbed by Moso for the initial phase.\n* Promotion and Monitoring: 1 month post-launch, with success metrics evaluated at the end of the quarter.\n\n## Conclusion\nThe proposed collaboration between Moso and Galxe presents a pioneering opportunity to redefine the landscape of crypto-based online shopping rewards. By integrating a white-labeled version of Moso’s platform into the Galxe ecosystem, this initiative will not only stimulate new capital inflows and enhance GAL token utility but will also quickly establish Galxe as a leader in the market of crypto rewards for online shopping.",

      "title": "[GP15] Galxe KOL Network 2024 Budget Proposal",
      "content": "## Abstract\nGalxe, the leading platform for building web3 communities, aims to expand its audience reach and establish a more dominant presence on various social media channels. Implementing a KOL (Key Opinion Leader) Network program is pivotal to this strategy. This proposal delineates a comprehensive plan to integrate KOLs into the Galxe ecosystem, thereby amplifying our digital footprint and forging robust connections with industry influencers.\n\n## Motivation\nGalxe faces several challenges:\n\n1. Limited Visibility: Galxe’s current visibility on digital platforms, including social media, is limited.\n2. Underutilized KOL Engagement: There is an untapped potential in leveraging KOLs to augment the platform’s user base, as well as amplify brand recognition and value.\n3. Content Quality: The educational material related to Galxe requires enhancement to engage better and attract users.\n4. Regional Outreach: Areas like Korea, Japan, Turkey, and Vietnam, known for their robust crypto communities and trading activities, are yet to fully engage with Galxe.\n\nTo address these challenges, we propose to allocate a budget from the treasury to grow the Galxe KOL Network. This program aims to attract renowned KOLs in the Web3 and cryptocurrency space to join Galxe, create content, and promote the platform & brand through their social media channels. We will engage KOLs with a substantial following and an organic, active community, ensuring their content aligns with our brand vision and values.\n\n## Specification\n### Overview\nThe general goal of the program is to invite more KOLs into Galxe’s network to have a better social media impact with more quality content generated, and build a firm relationship with different talent in the space.\n\n- Establish a stronger presence of Galxe platform & brand.\n- Establish a network of KOLs that speak for Galxe, its core vision and values.\n- Highlight key Galxe campaigns, important updates and news to a broader audience to ensure maximum exposure.\n- Generate and share comprehensive educational content about Galxe to increase user knowledge.\n\n### Scope/Implementation\nThe project team will oversee the operational processes to guarantee the KOL Network program’s quality and efficiency.\n\n1. Research and identify key KOLs with a minimum of 10K followers with a sufficiently active, organic community and consistent impressions on their social media channels.\n2. Contact and negotiate with KOLs to join thr Galxe KOL Network, outlining the terms, requirements and benefits.\n3. Have Guidelines and Agreements for KOLs to ensure a clear collaboration.\n4. Collaborate with KOLs to create high-quality content that promotes Galxe brand, platform and its unique features.\n5. The KOLs will share this content across their social media platforms and promote Galxe within their community.\n6. Maintain ongoing communication with KOLs, ensuring they have all the resources needed to succeed during the program.\n7. Continuous monitoring of content to maintain quality, frequency and compliance with any regulations.\n8. Provide transparent bi-monthly reports to the community regarding the performance of the Galxe KOL Network - number of impressions, content, and clicks.\n\nThe budget will be allocated for the following:\n\n- Cover the costs of various KOL benefits that are included in the Galxe KOL Network (as explained in [this blog post](https://blog.galxe.com/galxe-kol-network-be2574785761)).\n- In specific cases, the funds will be used as compensation for collaboration with select KOLs.\n\n### Success Criteria\nBelow are the key success criteria that this budget proposal will aim to achieve:\n\n1. KOL Network Expansion: Establish a network of over 100 KOLs by end of 2024.\n2. Boosted Brand Visibility: Significant increase in social media presence and reach a total of over 25 million impressions across various KOL social media channels (Twitter, Telegram, Youtube) by the end of 2024.\n3. Increased Platform Users: Ample growth of daily active users, active spaces, and campaigns on the Galxe platform.\n4. Community Expansion: A surge in new users, potential contributors, developers, and partners to the Galxe ecosystem.\n5. Increased KOL spaces on Galxe: The KOLs will have their own spaces to launch campaigns for their own communities, driving more users to the Galxe platform and Galxe social channels.\n6. Sustainable Relationships: Establishing lasting relationships with influencers for future collaborations.\n\n### Timeline\nThe Galxe KOL Network initiative has already commenced, and the requested budget will start being utilized in January of 2024. Key milestones involve KOL selection, outreach, content production, and promotional initiatives.\n\n### Budget\nWe are requesting 500,000 GAL tokens from the DAO treasury to fund the Galxe KOL Network budget for 2024. This budget will encompass various KOL benefits, such as campaign rewards, referral incentives, and program payments.\n\n- KOL Rewards and Incentives: For campaign participation and referrals.\n- Compensation: In line with negotiated terms, if applicable.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe Galxe KOL Network is instrumental in amplifying Galxe’s market presence, attracting a significant surge in new user growth, supercharging the growth of the Galxe ecosystem, and making Galxe one of the most well-known brands in the space in multiple regions. By collaborating with influential figures in the Web3 and cryptocurrency sectors to significantly elevate our social media influence and user engagement, we can achieve the aforementioned success criteria, and more. The allocated 500,000 GAL token budget will be pivotal in realizing these objectives, and steer Galxe towards a more prominent and strong position in this growing industry.\n\n### References\nGalxe KOL Network Blog Post - https://blog.galxe.com/galxe-kol-network-be2574785761",

      "title": "[GP13] Galxe Community Space Season 3 Rewards",
      "content": "Author: [Mani](https://community.galxe.org/u/Mani7)\n\n## Abstract\n\nThis proposal aims to secure a budget of 45,000 GAL tokens from the Galxe DAO treasury for the rewards of the Galxe Community Space's third season, running from October 9th to December 24th, 2023. The tokens will be divided into two categories: 50% for leaderboard rewards and 50% for Galxe Smart Balance.\n\n## Motivation\n\nBuilding on the success of Season 2, the objective is to sustain and elevate community involvement. The introduction of Galxe Smart Balance aims to offer additional utility and flexibility to users, thereby encouraging a more robust and long-term commitment to the Galxe ecosystem.\n\n## Specification\n\n### **Overview**\n\nThe proposed funding will serve two primary purposes:\n\n1. Rewarding active participants based on their ranking in the loyalty points leaderboard.\n2. Funding users' Galxe Smart Balance accounts as rewards, which offer flexibility for various uses within the Galxe ecosystem.\n\n### Smart Balance\n\nGalxe Smart Balance rewards hold significant value within Galxe itself, especially as a way for active users to have a seamless experience using the platform due to gas fees being covered across all chains. More importantly, it can be used to acquire Galxe Passport, Galxe Web3 Score, claim token rewards, and provide access upcoming features in Galxe 2.0 — including Galxe Premium features.\n\n### **Scope**\n\nThis proposal covers the rewards for Season 3, spanning from October 9th to December 24th, 2023. The tokens will be used exclusively for the two aforementioned categories.\n\n### **Reward Distribution**\n\n- **Leaderboard Rewards (22,500 GAL tokens)**\n    - Top 1-3 users: 1,250 GAL tokens (1st: 700, 2nd: 350, 3rd: 200 GAL)\n    - Top 4 - Top 1% (7 users): 700 GAL tokens (each user gets 100 GAL)\n    - Top 2-5% (40 users): 3,200 GAL tokens (each user gets 80 GAL)\n    - Top 6-15% (100 users): 5,000 GAL tokens (each user gets 50 GAL)\n    - Top 16-30% (150 users): 3,750 GAL tokens (each user gets 25 GAL)\n    - Top 31-50% (200 users): 3,000 GAL tokens (each user gets 15 GAL)\n    - Top 51-100% (500 users): 5,600 GAL tokens (each user gets 11,2 GAL)\n- **Galxe Smart Balance (22,500 GAL tokens)**\n    - The distribution will be communicated at a later date, based on leaderboard standings and any additional criteria introduced during Season 3. The amount of users in the leaderboard that will receive a Smart Balance allocation depends on the amount deemed to bring the most positive impact to as many users as possible, as well as considering the pricing structure of any upcoming Galxe Premium features in the future.\n\n### **Success Criteria**\n\n- Sustained or increased user engagement in loyalty campaigns.\n- Positive community feedback on the new Galxe features.\n- Growth in Galxe's user base and ecosystem.\n- Further user education about the Galxe product, features and vision.\n\n### Timeline/Budget\n\nThe budget for this proposal is set at 45,000 GAL tokens. Rewards will be distributed at the end of Season 3, during the last week of December, 2023.\n\n## References\n\n- Season 2 Proposal Snapshot Vote - **[Link](https://snapshot.org/#/gal.eth/proposal/0x2eb66b901a2acbab008cc524e75aae7beb27cd7d00a50d1a7b894d04f7c999b3)**\n- Galxe Community Space - **[Website](https://galxe.com/galxecommunity)**",

      "content": "Author: [alexkat](https://community.galxe.org/u/alexkat)\n\n## Goal:\nOur main aim is to discourage multi-accounting and enhance the uniqueness and security of user interactions across the crypto space. We aim to do this through the development of a distinctive device identification application and an NFT minting system.\n\n## Abstract:\nDevelopment of a cross-platform user application for automating the process of device identification and NFT minting. The application will collect certain device parameters, generate a unique hash, and trigger the creation of a unique NFT, which will be stored in the user’s EVM-compatible wallet.\n\n## Motivation:\nThe proposed device identification application and NFT minting system can greatly increase the security and uniqueness of user interactions throughout the crypto ecosystem. By discouraging multi-accounting, we can provide a fairer and more balanced environment for all users. In addition, by associating each device with a unique NFT, we can create a unique digital asset for each user that can be traded or sold, adding an extra layer of functionality and value to the user experience.\n\n## Details:\nOur proposed project involves the development of a cross-platform application that streamlines the process of user device identification and NFT minting. The application will collect certain device parameters, produce a unique hash, and initiate the creation of a unique NFT, which will then be stored in the user's EVM compatible wallet.\n\n### Scope:\nThe project includes the creation of a unique open source device identification application written in C++ (for Windows, OSX, Linux), Java (for Android) and Swift (for iOS). Web interface on React, Backend Nodejs.\n\n### Success Criteria:\n\n- Successful collection of specific device parameters and generation of a unique hash by the application.\n- Successful triggering of a unique NFT creation based on the generated hash.\n- Prevention of re-binding a device that already has an associated NFT.\n\n### Timeline/Budget:\n\nThe proposed project development period is 6 months with the following schedule:\n- Month 1-2: Develop and test the applications for Windows, OSX, Linux, Android, and iOS.\n- Month 3-4: Front-end development of the user \"devices\" section on the DeviceNFT website, and back-end development for the application interaction with the DeviceNFT API. \n- Month 5: Submission of the application to the Google Play Store and Apple App Store. Integration and testing of the application with the DeviceNFT website.\n- Month 6: Selection of a group of users from the DeviceNFT community for alpha testing, fixing potential errors, and the official launch of the production version.\n\nAs development and research progress, there may be necessary adjustments to the timeline. These will be communicated and justified accordingly to ensure that the project remains as transparent and accountable as possible.\n\nThe budget for the project is $20,000 worth of GAL tokens, distributed as follows:\n- $10,000 will be provided at the beginning of the project to cover the cost of initial development, testing, debugging, and optimization of the application.\n- The remaining $10,000 will be disbursed upon successful completion of the project, as demonstrated by the application's ability to meet the outlined success criteria and the successful launch of the application.\n\nThis budget will cover all costs associated with the project, including development, testing, debugging, optimization, and release of the application.\n\nUpon the successful completion of development, the data generated by DeviceNFT will be offered to Galxe for utilization in their Sybil prevention measures. This contribution will be contingent on Galxe's formal acceptance and approval of the request, facilitating a cooperative effort to enhance security within the crypto ecosystem.\n\n## Web Interface Description: \nThe DeviceNFT web interface will have a user-friendly and intuitive layout that ensures a seamless interaction between users and the platform. The interface will be based on the \"Devices\" section, designed in the form of a passport. This section will host a catalog of released NFTs (ERC721) associated with devices. It will also provide links to download the device identification app. Once the app is launched, users will be able to enter the wallet address they wish to link to their device and activate the sync button. This action will cause the program to send the hashed device ID data to the DeviceNFT API. Users can then return to the device page on the DeviceNFT website to confirm their request. Once the request is approved, an NFT mint request will be initiated and the new associated device will appear in the list of user devices. To improve the user experience, the web interface will also support the concept of adding multiple accounts (wallets) to a single device, which will be covered in a separate proposal. The design will prioritize ease of use, clarity, and appealing aesthetics, delivering a fluid and engaging user experience.\n\n## Conclusion:\nOur proposed application will automate the process of device identification and NFT creation, enhancing the user experience and making it easier for users to interact with the Web3 credential framework. By discouraging multi-accounting, the application will improve the uniqueness and security of user interactions and allow for more flexibility in transferring device ownership throughout the crypto space. The author of this proposal will oversee development and testing of the application.",

      "title": "[GP10] Community Space Season 2 Rewards",
      "content": "## Abstract\n\nThis proposal seeks to secure funding from the Galxe DAO treasury for the rewards of the Galxe Community Space's second season, which will run from July 20th to September 30th, 2023. A revised budget of 40,000 GAL tokens is being requested, which will be distributed as rewards to users based on their active participation and ranking in various loyalty campaigns within the Galxe Community Space during Season 2.\n\n## Motivation\n\nCapitalizing on the tremendous success of Season 1, which saw over 80k unique users in the loyalty points leaderboard and more than 4k users qualifying for rewards, our focus remains on sustaining and increasing this level of community engagement. The Galxe Community Space continues to serve as a key platform for loyalty campaigns aimed at encouraging user participation and promoting active engagement within the Galxe ecosystem. By rewarding users with GAL tokens, we can further enhance community engagement, strengthen loyalty, and foster a stronger sense of unity among Galxe users. The campaigns will be curated by the Galxe operational team and the Space Cadets (Galxe Contributors), ensuring that they align with the community’s needs and goals.\n\n## Specification\n\n### Overview\n\nThe proposed funding will be used to reward users who actively participate in the loyalty campaigns within the Galxe Community Space during Season 2. Participants will earn loyalty points for completing tasks in each campaign. At the end of the season, the total reward pool of GAL tokens will be distributed to the top 1000 participants based on their ranking in the loyalty points leaderboard, providing an exciting incentive to participate.\n\n### Scope\n\nThis proposal covers the rewards for Season 2 of the Galxe Community Space, which will span from July 20th to September 30th, 2023. The funds will be used exclusively for rewarding participants in the loyalty campaigns.\n\n### Reward Distribution\n\n- Top 1-3 users: 1,500 GAL tokens distributed as follows: 1st place gets 750 GAL, 2nd gets 500 GAL, and 3rd gets 250 GAL.\n- Top 4 - Top 1% (7 users in total): 1,800 GAL tokens distributed evenly, each user in this tier gets 180 GAL.\n- Top 2-5% (40 users): 5,400 GAL tokens distributed evenly, each user in this tier gets 135 GAL.\n- Top 6-15% (100 users): 8,500 GAL tokens distributed evenly, each user in this tier gets 85 GAL.\n- Top 16-30% (150 users): 8,000 GAL tokens distributed evenly, each user in this tier gets ~53.33 GAL.\n- Top 31-50% (200 users): 6,500 GAL tokens distributed evenly, each user in this tier gets 32.5 GAL.\n- Top 51-100% (500 users): 8,300 GAL tokens distributed evenly, each user in this tier gets 17.68 GAL.\n\nTotal: 40,000 GAL tokens to be distributed.\n\n## Success Criteria\n\nThe success of this proposal will be assessed based on:\n\n* Sustained and increased user engagement and participation in the loyalty campaigns.\n* Positive feedback from the community on the campaigns and rewards.\n* Growth in Galxe’s user base and overall ecosystem.\n* Enhanced loyalty and unity among Galxe users driven by the attractive rewards.\n\n## Timeline/Budget\n\nThe requested budget for this proposal is revised to 40,000 GAL tokens. The rewards will be distributed at the end of Season 2, on September 30th, 2023. The Galxe Space Cadets will continue their collaboration with the Galxe operations team to design and launch diverse loyalty campaigns during this period.\n\n## References\n\nSeason 1 Proposal - https://community.galxe.org/t/proposal-community-space-season-1-rewards/26396\nSeason 2 Blog Post - https://blog.galxe.com/embark-on-the-exciting-journey-of-galxe-community-space-season-2-ba96d487b18f\nGalxe Community Space - https://galxe.com/galxecommunity",

      "content": "# Abstract:\nDevelopment of a Chrome extension for Galxe - the largest Web3 credential platform, which automates the claiming of OATs and provides hints for ongoing campaigns on partner websites.\n\n# Motivation:\nWeb3 credential platform requires a user-friendly interface to interact with the platform. A Chrome extension will make it easier for users to claim OATs and participate in ongoing campaigns on partner websites. In addition, it can also leverage the power of Galxe ID SDK for a more seamless experience in the future.\n\n# Specification\n\n## Overview:\nThe proposed project will develop a Chrome extension that automates the claiming of OATs and provides hints for ongoing campaigns on partner websites. The extension will query the Galxe API to determine what OATs are available for a user to claim. The extension will then automatically go to the relevant campaign pages and claim the OATs. The extension will also gather partner URLs from the Galxe API and update a badge number on the extension icon when there are ongoing campaigns available on a partner website. When the user clicks the extension icon, they will be able to see information about the ongoing events.\n\n## Scope:\nThe scope of the project includes development of a Chrome extension in TypeScript that interacts with the Galxe API to automate OAT claiming and provides hints for ongoing campaigns on partner websites. The extension will be open-sourced, and available on the Chrome Web Store.\n\n## Success Criteria:\n* The extension successfully automates the claiming of OATs after querying the Galxe API.\n* The extension successfully displays a badge number on the extension icon when there are ongoing campaigns available on a partner website.\n* The extension successfully displays information about the ongoing events when the user clicks the extension icon.\n* The extension is successfully published on the Chrome Web Store.\n\n## Timeline/Budget:\nThe proposed development time for the project is 2 months with the following timeline:\n* Month 1: Extension development and testing, integration of the Galxe API, and user interface design.\n* Month 2: Debugging, optimization, and submission of the extension to the Chrome Web Store.\n\nThe budget for the project is 10,000 USD in $GAL token. It will cover the cost of development, testing, debugging, optimization, and submission of the extension to the Chrome Web Store. \n\n## Conclusion:\nIn conclusion, the proposed Chrome extension will automate the claiming of OATs and provide hints for ongoing campaigns on partner websites. This will streamline the user experience and make it easier for users to interact with the Web3 credential platform.",

      "content": "## **Abstract**\n\nWe propose the funding of 200,000 ARB tokens from the DAO treasury as a gas fee credit associated with claiming NFTs on Arbitrum chain on the Galxe platform. This proposal seeks to eliminate the cost of claiming NFTs for users, increase user participation, attract more partner campaigns, and reduce the barrier to entry for potential new users.\n\n## **Motivation**\n\nThe necessity of bearing the gas fees to claim NFTs has surfaced as a significant barrier for large-scale partner campaigns, and to broader participation on the Galxe platform. It not only discourages active user participation but also presents a high entry threshold for potential users and partners to discover the Arbitrum chain and its protocols. To foster a more inclusive environment and stimulate growth, it is important to tackle this issue head-on for a significant boost in Galxe campaign count on Arbitrum chain and user participation.\n\n## **Specification**\n\n**Overview**\n\nThis proposal aims to secure 200,000 ARB tokens from the DAO treasury to cover user gas fees associated with claiming NFTs on the Galxe platform. By doing so, we hope to ensure the seamless participation of users in various campaigns, attract more partners, and facilitate the onboarding of new users.\n\n**Scope**\n\nThe proposal applies to all NFT transactions on the Galxe platform that are conducted on the Arbitrum chain. All active and future users of the Galxe platform, along with potential and existing partners running campaigns, will be covered under this proposal.\n\n**Success Criteria**\n\nThe success of this proposal will be measured by:\n\n1. An increase in user participation in campaigns after the reimbursement initiative is implemented.\n2. A surge in the number of new users on the platform post-implementation.\n3. The growth in the number of partner campaigns launched on Arbitrum chain on the platform post-implementation.\n4. Positive feedback and increased satisfaction from users and partners due to reduced cost barriers.\n\n**Timeline/Budget**\n\nThe timeline for the implementation of this proposal is projected to be one month. The proposed budget is 200,000 ARB tokens from the DAO treasury. This figure will be allocated exclusively towards the gas fee credit for campaigns launched on Arbitrum chain on Galxe.",

      "content": "## Abstract\nThis proposal suggests incentivizing the wider use of the Galxe Passport within the Galxe Community Space and the introduction of a loyalty point threshold for reward allocation. I propose a two-fold approach: (1) Implementing benefits for Galxe Passport holders to encourage its usage without making it a requirement for participation, and (2) introducing a point threshold to ensure only the truly loyal users are rewarded, thereby reducing the impact of Sybil attacks.\n## Motivation\nThe Galxe Passport has the potential to play a pivotal role in enhancing user experience, security, and identity management within the Galxe ecosystem. Incentivizing its use can ensure more robust interaction and engagement within the Community Space. Additionally, introducing a loyalty point threshold for reward allocation will ensure that the most dedicated and engaged members of the community are rewarded, helping to foster a more active and committed user base.\n## Specification\n1. Incentivizing Galxe Passport Usage\n\nGalxe Passport holders participating in the Community Space will receive additional benefits. These benefits could include extra loyalty points. This approach promotes the usage of Galxe Passport while ensuring that it is not a prerequisite for Community Space participation.\n2. Introduction of Loyalty Point Threshold\n\nTo ensure that rewards are allocated to truly loyal users, I suggest to introduced a point threshold. Users must accumulate a minimum number of loyalty points to qualify for rewards. This system will help minimize the impact of Sybil attacks and ensure that the reward system is fair and incentivizes true engagement.\n### Success Criteria\nThe success of this proposal would be measured by:\n- The increase in Galxe Passport usage within the Community Space\n- The growth of truly engaged and active users reflected in loyalty points\n- The implementation of these initiatives should be possible without a increase in budget as they mostly involve adjustments to the existing system\n## Conclusion\nThis proposal aims to enhance the Galxe Community Space by promoting Galxe Passport usage and introducing a more refined reward allocation system. I believe these changes will create a more engaging, fair, and secure community environment.",

The focus of all events will be on Galxe’s social platform growth and engagement, Forum and DAO participation, Discord community engagement and participation, and partner space growth and partner campaign participation.\n\n### Scope\nThis proposal covers all community events and initiatives that will be undertaken within the next few months. The funds will cover the costs of prizes and rewards for these events. This proposal does not cover any operational expenses for Galxe. Any remaining funds which were not distributed as rewards during the mentioned period will be allocated as rewards for future events and programs.\n\n### Success Criteria\nThe success criteria for this proposal are as follows:\n- Increased engagement and participation in the Galxe Discord.\n- Increased engagement on Galxe’s social channels.\n- Increased participation in partner campaigns.\n- Increased participation in the Galxe DAO & Forum.\n\n### Timeline/Budget\nThe expected budget for this proposal is $45,000 in GAL tokens.

Additionally, signer Joanna from Galxe team has informed the DAO that they are unavailable to participate in Multisig transactions, which may cause operational difficulties. Therefore, it is in the best interest of the DAO to replace both signers Kelvin and Joanna with new signers to ensure and maintain the effectiveness of the Multisig.\n\n**Introducing the new signers**:\n\nBoyang - Founder of Project Twelve, P12 for short. Prior to P12, Boyang built the No.1 mobile gaming platform in China with 12 million daily active users. Boyang received his education from National University of Singapore and Yale University, majoring in Computer Science.\n\nMani - Head of Community for Galxe. Mani is a long-time crypto enthusiast and community builder with over 5 years of experience in the industry. He has worked in various community-oriented positions in the past, has built multiple communities from the ground up, and has previously contributed to multiple DAOs.\n\n**The updated Multisig signer list is as follows**:\n\nMani - Galxe Team\nBoyang - Project Twelve Steven Lei - Galxe Community \nAnne Well - Galxe Team\nShiyu - CyberConnect\nMable - STEPN\nFico - Galxe Team\nHiker - Galxe Community\nTian - Galxe Team  \n\nThese Multisig signer changes are necessary to ensure a smooth operation of the Treasury Multisig and the Galxe DAO.",

      "content": "Please refer to the Galxe Contributor Program overview [here](https://blog.galxe.com/galxe-contributor-program-5d96ac75e4ae).\n\n**Introduction**\n\nAs a massive Web3 community, Galxe relies heavily on the contributions of its community members to ensure its success and growth. In order to foster a flourishing community, it is important to recognize and reward the efforts of those who contribute to Galxe. This proposal aims to introduce a rewards model for the Galxe contributors in the official Galxe Contributor Program for their contributions in Q1 (Jan- March) of 2023, and to be reevaluated and adjusted in Q2 (April- June) of 2023.\n\n**Problem**\n\nCurrently, there is no formal program in place to reward contributors in the Contributor Program for their contributions to Galxe. This lack of recognition and incentive may discourage potential contributors from getting involved and actively participating in the community.\n\n**Proposed Solution**\n\nTo address this issue, a program that rewards contributors from the community treasury will be established to reward contributors for their contributions in Q1 of 2023. The Contributor Program members will track contributions manually and the internal Galxe team members will review them continuously to ensure accountability. The rewards will be distributed based on the results of the internal evaluation process, which identifies the amount and quality of contributions completed by each individual contributor. Rewards will be distributed in the form of GAL tokens at the end of the quarter, with a total of 10,000 GAL tokens being distributed in Q1 of 2023, to be re-evaluated in Q2 2023. Contributions will be publicly visible to everyone.\n\n**Implementation**\n\n1. Establish a system for contributors to track contributions manually.\n2. Assign a team of internal Galxe members to perpetually review contributions, using a point system to evaluate the amount and quality of contributions.\n3. At the end Q1 of 2023, distribute GAL tokens to all contributors based on their contribution performance.\n4. Make the contributions publicly visible to everyone.\n5. Re-evaluate the rewards system in Q2 of 2023 to ensure its effectiveness and make adjustments if necessary.\n\n**Expected Outcomes**\n\n- Increased engagement and participation from community members.\n- Greater accountability and transparency of Galxe platform within the program.\n- Recognition and incentive for community members who contribute to Galxe's success.\n\n**Community Involvement**\n\n- Feedback and suggestions: The community can provide feedback and suggestions for the program through a dedicated channel, such as a forum or Discord channel. The internal Galxe team will regularly review and respond to feedback and suggestions. We will evaluate the quality of the program structure based on community feedback, and make adjustments to the program if necessary.\n- Transparency: The contributions and reward distribution of the program will be publicly visible to everyone, to ensure that the community is aware of the rewards being distributed and the criteria for earning them.\n\n**Risks and Mitigations**\n\n- Risk of subjectivity in the evaluation process: To mitigate this risk, a clear set of criteria will be established to evaluate contributions, and multiple internal Galxe team members will review contributions to ensure that evaluations are fair, balanced and unbiased.\n- Risk of low participation: To mitigate this risk, the program will be heavily promoted and communicated within the community, and the rewards for participation will be clearly outlined. Additionally, regular feedback and suggestions for the program will be solicited from the community to ensure the program is meeting their needs and expectations.\n\n**Budget**\n\n10000 GAL tokens for Q1 of 2023.\n\n**Timeline**\n\n- Implementation and launch of the rewards program in Q1 2023.\n- Review and re-evaluation in Q2 2023.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe Galxe Contributor Program Rewards will not only recognize and reward contributors for their contributions, but it will also increase engagement and participation from community members, accountability, and transparency within the program. It is a vital step towards building a successful and flourishing community for Galxe.",

      "content": "[Project Galaxy](http://galaxy.eco) posted its first Project Galaxy DAO Proposal asking its community members to nominate candidates for the role of Community Treasury and multi-sig signers. The proposal received 24 nominations and the community must now vote for 9 nominees to be on the treasury committee. Candidates were asked to provide their name, Twitter handle and a summary of their involvement or future planned involvement in the Project Galaxy ecosystem. Please find the list [here](https://to.galaxy.eco/b5SLNs).\n\nThe vote will take place on snapshot from June 6th, 12pm PST to June 13th, 12 PM PST. Voters must hold the $GAL token to be eligible to vote. Voting Power is a «Weighted Voting» meaning the more $GAL a voter owns, the more voting power they have. If a voter has $GAL on both ETH and BSC, their voting power will be accumulated.\n\nVoters can also delegate their voting power to another member. [Delegate here](https://snapshot.org/#/delegate/project-galaxy.eth).\n\n- Delegation isn’t cross-chain.\n- If a voter has $GAL on both ETH and BSC and wants to delegate all their GAL on both chains, they must do it twice.\n- Delegation can’t be fractionalized.\n\nThe $GAL token is available for trading across many of the top cryptocurrency exchanges including [Binance](https://www.binance.com/el/support/announcement/ea7c702d59a84dc29e2ed7ab3ad24c38?utm_campaign=Newsletter%20from%20Project%20Galaxy%20%E2%98%B0&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter), [Crypto.com](https://twitter.com/Cryptocom_Insto/status/1531621528852307968?s=20&t=0SYd-lYtN6F4X1QkjqB3eQ), [Coinbase](https://twitter.com/CoinbaseListing/status/1522216544331132930?s=20&t=cCbCo215v6B5bnawpOHrLQ&utm_campaign=Newsletter%20from%20Project%20Galaxy%20%E2%98%B0&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter), [Kucoin](https://twitter.com/kucoincom/status/1522529853878071296?s=20&t=cCbCo215v6B5bnawpOHrLQ&utm_campaign=Newsletter%20from%20Project%20Galaxy%20%E2%98%B0&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter), [Bit.com](https://twitter.com/bitcom_exchange/status/1522546730306355201?s=20&t=cCbCo215v6B5bnawpOHrLQ&utm_campaign=Newsletter%20from%20Project%20Galaxy%20%E2%98%B0&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter), [Huobi,](https://twitter.com/HuobiGlobal/status/1522058478503620608?s=20&t=cCbCo215v6B5bnawpOHrLQ&utm_campaign=Newsletter%20from%20Project%20Galaxy%20%E2%98%B0&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) [WOO Network](https://twitter.com/WOOnetwork/status/1522534681484353536?s=20&t=cCbCo215v6B5bnawpOHrLQ&utm_campaign=Newsletter%20from%20Project%20Galaxy%20%E2%98%B0&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter), [BitMart](https://twitter.com/BitMartExchange/status/1522222084318920706?s=20&t=cCbCo215v6B5bnawpOHrLQ&utm_campaign=Newsletter%20from%20Project%20Galaxy%20%E2%98%B0&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter), [Bitget](https://twitter.com/bitgetglobal/status/1522105969731411974?s=20&t=cCbCo215v6B5bnawpOHrLQ&utm_campaign=Newsletter%20from%20Project%20Galaxy%20%E2%98%B0&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter), [Gate.io](https://twitter.com/gate_io/status/1522238586212564993?s=20&t=cCbCo215v6B5bnawpOHrLQ&utm_campaign=Newsletter%20from%20Project%20Galaxy%20%E2%98%B0&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter), [Bybit](https://twitter.com/Bybit_Official/status/1522222352322338816?s=20&t=cCbCo215v6B5bnawpOHrLQ&utm_campaign=Newsletter%20from%20Project%20Galaxy%20%E2%98%B0&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) and [Zapper](https://twitter.com/ProjectGalaxyHQ/status/1522597661001531396?s=20&t=cCbCo215v6B5bnawpOHrLQ&utm_campaign=Newsletter%20from%20Project%20Galaxy%20%E2%98%B0&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter).",
