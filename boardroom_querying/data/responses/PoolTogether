Any leftover after paying for the RNG is contributed on behalf of the POOL prize vault (przPOOL). The smaller percentage in the range is the cut at the highest tiers (high TVL) and the bigger percentage is the cut at the lowest tiers (low TVL)\n> - The minimum TVL listed is what is required for the draws to be awarded every draw period.

      "content": "This proposal follows the RFC regarding the establishment of a new vault with a charitable component. If approved the Exec Team would transfer the OP tokens to the PoolTime team for use as depositor incentives in a charitable vault.\n\nVoting Requirements\nQuorum: 100,000 votes\nApproval: Simple majority\n\nContext\nThe Exec Team service contract has ended but they still custody 87,982.847 $OP tokens. These tokens are held on behalf of the PoolTogether treasury and were accumulated through AAVE incentives during PoolTogether V4. This proposal looks to mobilize these unused tokens to incentivize depositors and grow the protocol on Optimism, while proving the concept of a charitable use case.\n\nProposal Details\n-------------------\n\nTransfer of Funds\nThe Executive Team will transfer 87,982.847 OP tokens to the PoolTime team.\n\nDevelopment and Deployment\nThe PoolTime team will develop and deploy a new application to highlight the charitable components of the vault. The ETA for this deployment is one month.\nThe launch of the charitable vault is targeted for mid-September, with the specific charity to be determined with community input.\n\nIncentive Structure\nDepositor incentives will be distributed over six months in monthly claimable promotions.\nOne-third of the vault yield will be directed to the selected charity with the remaining two thirds generating chance in the prize pool for depositors.\n  \nKey Performance Indicator (KPI)\nThe goal is to achieve an incentivized TVL of $2.2million, with $110,000 in OP incentives at a 10% APR reflecting a current price of $1.25 per OP.",

      "content": "# PTIP-89: Sunsetting PoolTogether V4\n## Simple Summary\nThis proposal outlines the plan to wind down PoolTogether V4. **The proposal requests the Executive Team to pursue their mandate to execute updated parameters for the balanceCap and Draw Percentage Rate, effectively sunsetting PoolTogether V4.**\n\nIn addition to this vote, several teams (*namely the Exec Team, PoolTogether Inc, Generation Software, and Pooltime*) present their coordinated efforts to support users with the migration to PoolTogether V5, ensuring a seamless transition with the aim of making users feel whole.\n\n## Abstract\nThis proposal will bring the sunset of PoolTogether V4 in motion. It calls on the Exec Team to pursue the sunsetting of PoolTogether V4 and use their mandate to:\n- Set the balanceCap parameter to zero: This parameter effectively avoids new deposits.\n- Execute new DPR parameters to set the effective prize rate to zero: The updated parameters will avoid the distribution of prizes.\n- Withdraw all V4 prize liquidity back to the protocol treasury on Ethereum\n\nThe proposed transition aims to optimize PoolTogether’s resources, reduce ongoing maintenance costs, and enhance the prize experience for V5 users.\n\nFor transparency, the extended action steps of our migration plan are listed in detail on [the forum](https://gov.pooltogether.com/t/ptip-89-sunsetting-pooltogether-v4/3143). \n## Motivation\n\nPoolTogether V5 is live and requires the community’s focus and attention. \n\nContrary to V5, the system of PoolTogether V4 requires maintenance, like balancing prize liquidity between chains or managing prize distribution. Every prize draw is a cost to the protocol treasury as the RNG needs funding and the results have to be bridged to all chains PoolTogether V4 is live on. \n\nAdditionally, PoolTogether V4 still locks up substantial resources: \n- $5.5M in TVL\n- $170K in prize liquidity across Optimism, Avalanche, Polygon, and Ethereum\n- 20k $OP in unclaimed incentives\n\nBy winding down PoolTogether V4, we can capture a portion of its TVL in V5, save costs on infrastructure and maintenance, remove old dependencies, and free prize liquidity. As a bonus, the sunset of V4 unlocks unclaimed OP incentives that can be repurposed to contribute to the growth of PoolTogether V5.\n\n## Specification\n\n### Overview\n\nThis proposal doesn’t require POOL token holders to take any onchain action. All necessary actions can be carried out through the existing mandates of the Execution Team. By voting `for` on this proposal, POOL holders are requesting the Executive Team to pursue their mandate to execute the above-mentioned protocol parameters.\n\nPlease visit the [the forum](https://gov.pooltogether.com/t/ptip-89-sunsetting-pooltogether-v4/3143) to review the full migration game plan.\n\n### Rationale\nThe rationale behind this proposal is rooted in the financial overhead associated with V4's maintenance. The treasury shoulders expenses related to RNG costs, bridge operations, transaction fees, and ongoing work. These costs can be redirected to support the growth and development of the V5 ecosystem.\n\nAt the same time, it’s crucial to make the users of PoolTogether V4 feel whole. Before this proposal was drafted, a [Request for Comments](https://gov.pooltogether.com/t/rfc-sunset-pooltogether-v4/3116) was presented on the forum. The Council got together to consider and discuss the possibilities at hand. PoolTogether’s team of teams came to the conclusion that our problems are best solved by replacing the PoolTogether V4 App with a Migration App. The new migration app will continue to provide anyone with access to their V4 funds going forward.\n\nSeveral teams have coordinated their efforts to ensure the best possible migration experience. \n\nThis protocol does not yet present a way to cleanly deprecate the prize pools. As a community, we still need to figure out what happens with *future* yield that is being generated, by any TVL we are unable to migrate. We will have to revisit this topic soon.

      "title": "PTIP-87 Winding down the POOL pool Snapshot",
      "content": "## Simple Summary\nThis proposal winds down the gasless voting setup of the [POOL pool Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/poolpool.pooltogether.eth) due to low engagement and potential future risk.\n\nThe proposal outlines specific steps to wind down the Snapshot, including removing delegation, restricting proposal creation, and removing pPOOL mentions from the PoolTogether platforms.\n\n## Motivation\n\nHistorically the POOL pool acted as a gasless voting mechanism for POOL holders. It also dripped additional POOL rewards to depositors in the past. Both of this is not true anymore.\n\nThe POOL pool Snapshot has very low engagement and creates unnecessary processes that complicates onchain governance.\n\nReasons for winding it down:\n- The Snapshot hasn’t reached Quorum (20%) since March 2022\n- There isn’t much demand for gasless voting as gas prices are reasonable\n- It creates unnecessary friction for onchain governance\n- It relies on humans to execute the vote\n- The POOL pool rewards have ended and are unlikely to start again\n- The pool has halved in deposits since its ATH (from 1.02m down to 519k POOL)\n- A vote is easy to swing: Due to technical limitations, the multi-sig must always vote with its full voting power. If 20% of circulating pPOOL votes for on a proposal, the full 100% of pPOOL votes will for.\n\n## Specification\n\n### Overview\n\nIf the proposal succeeds the following steps will be taken in order to wind down the POOL pool Snapshot and its functionality, as well as to inform the community:\n- Remove the POOL delegation from [Stake Prize Pool](https://etherscan.io/address/0x396b4489da692788e327E2e4b2B0459A5Ef26791) to the [POOL pool Multisig](https://app.safe.global/home?safe=eth:0x070a96fe4Ad5155eA91d409E8AFec6B2F3C729c0)\n- Set the Snapshot to only allow authors to create proposals (done)\n- Remove all authors in the [settings of the pPOOL Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/poolpool.pooltogether.eth/settings) \n- Remove pPOOL from the [PoolTogether.eth snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/pooltogether.eth)\n- Remove pPOOL mentions from Governance Documentation & Forum Posts\n- Post announcement\n- Remove the option to deposit into POOL pool [from the app](https://app.pooltogether.com/account)\n\n### Rationale\n\nThe proposal was discussed througholy on Discord and later brought as [RFC to the governance forum](https://gov.pooltogether.com/t/rfc-wind-down-the-pool-pool-snapshot/2900). \n\nThe alternative to this proposal would be to fully embrace the gasless voting setup of the POOL pool, but with the mentioned dangers down the road it's likely not feasible.\n\nObjections were made that we should not cut off voters. Since the original POOL pool implementation lots of new opportunities in community governance arised. I encourage the community to propose new governance experiments that better suit our risk-tolerance once this proposal has passed.\n\n### Technical Specification\n\nThe proposal calls the compLikeDelegate function to re-delegate the voting power of the [StakePrizePool](https://etherscan.io/address/0x396b4489da692788e327e2e4b2b0459a5ef26791) to `0x00000000000000000000000000000000000000`:\n\n```\n| # | Name | Type | Data |\n| -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- |\n| 0 | compLike | address | 0x0cEC1A9154Ff802e7934Fc916Ed7Ca50bDE6844e |\n| 1 | to | address | 0x00000000000000000000000000000000000000 |\n```\n\r\n```\nFunction: compLikeDelegate(address compLike, address to)\n\nMethodID: 0x2f7627e3\n[0]:  0000000000000000000000000cec1a9154ff802e7934fc916ed7ca50bde6844e\n[1]:  00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000\n```",

We handle custody and transaction matters where directed by governance, such as claiming rewards, and receiving tokens on networks other than mainnet. We are the goto solution for maximum security custody for the community.\n\nScope of Work\nThe Executive Team is owner of the PT V4 contracts and will be taking over the role of managing the draw percentage rate parameters previously overseen by The Finance Team. The parameters will be adjusted according to a framework designed by The Finance Team which aims to continue with prize sustainability relative to yield.\n\nWe will continue the custody of delegations for the Community Team, Grants, and Growth. Custody continues to be $300k in total.\n\nWe continue with a custody limit of $750k to put a hard cap on our total custody. Activities that approach the cap will be brought forward as an alert. Any funds over that amount will need to be approved by a vote to change the cap. This gives the community a clear picture of what our custody risk is.\n\nGoal\nOur primary focus is security. We will maintain 6/9 multi-sigs of senior contributors who are well versed in PoolTogether infrastructure, happenings, and the greater DeFi ecosystem.\n\nWe look to act in a timely and efficient manner to ensure prize liquidity never runs dry, and that Pooler and treasury funds are safe.\n\nThese pillars form our goals\n\nSecurity\nNo loss. We strive to never lose funds. This is an easily evaluated metric we strive to maintain.\n\nActing on governance directives\nA quarterly team survey evaluates our performance alignment with governance directives. The executive-team aligns with the council. Any concerns from the community are encouraged.\n\nEnsuring prize delivery\nPrizes promised are prizes delivered. We strive for no failed prize claims due to a lack of prize liquidity.\n\nActing in an organized and efficient way.\nTransactions are presented by lead as having a standard 24hr time to sign and execute. Transactions requiring more immediate attention are presented with a 12hr time to sign and execute. The team will strive to always meet these deadlines and missed time windows will be reported at quarters end.\n\nTimeline\nThe team will be funded and active for all of Q3.\n\nBudget\nAmount\tToken\n10,536\tUSDC\n3,843\tPOOL",

In that time, we will execute on an upgrade to the PoolTogether DAO's onchain Governance contracts.\n\n[ScopeLift](https://scopelift.co/team) is a 7 person team of expert EVM devs. We've had the pleasure of working with many great projects in the space, including Uniswap, Optimism, Gitcoin, Endaoment, and others. We have our own project called [Umbra](https://app.umbra.cash/), which is a tool for privacy preserving payments. Contracts we've written have processed and custodied hundreds of millions of dollars.\n\nScopeLift has extensive experience relevant to the project being proposed. We have previously received grant funding for Governance related work from Uniswap, Aave, and the Ethereum Foundation. We created [Flexible Voting](https://www.scopelift.co/blog/introducing-flexible-voting) and helped build and maintain [Seatbelt](https://www.scopelift.co/blog/seatbelt-for-governance). We are currently working with [Gitcoin](https://github.com/gitcoinco/Alpha-Governor-Upgrade) to execute a similar Governor upgrade for that DAO.",

      "title": "PTBR-2: PoolTogether <> Generation Software Inc",
      "content": "**TL;DR**\n\n*This is an announcement of the new company Generation Software, and it's initiative to provide research, development and support for the PoolTogether Protocol.*\n\n|         |        |\n| ------- | ------ |\n| Start Date | July 1st, 2023 |\n| Timeline for Deliverables | 3 months |\n| Budget | $460,000 |\n\nGeneration Software (GS) was formed to unlock new human behaviours using innovative technology. We believe that the PoolTogether V5 hyperstructure is the most accessible way to incentivize wealth building, and wish to help it achieve widespread adoption.\n\n## Our Team\n\nOur company is comprised of PoolTogether community members and ex-employees of PoolTogether Inc. who hold deep knowledge of the technology, our history, and the vision for the future. In the past we've made core contributions to the protocol, so we have direct hands-on experience.\n\n## Our Values\n\nWe are dedicated to:\n\n- The research, application and innovation of new technologies that benefit people. \n- Work in harmony and alignment, while maintaining a high degree of autonomy. We work together, but also encourage the individual to excel.\n- Continuously improve everything we do; whether it's improving the way we work, trying out new ideas, or learning new technology.\n- Contributing to the fields in which we operate. We open source our technology whenever possible, contribute to new standards and ideas, and help others who wish to learn and engage with our products.\n\n# Scope of Work\n\n## Motivation\n\nWe're an extremely knowledgable team that can accelerate PoolTogether's growth.\n\n## Goal\n\nOur goal is to deploy the PoolTogether hyperstructure to as many chains as possible, and to maximize distribution and reach of the protocol. We will support the PoolTogether community's permissionless expansion of the protocol.\n\nThis first PTBR will help get the hyperstructure off the ground. GS expects to make future PTBRs with deliverables that build on the foundation laid in this first quarter.\n\n## Deliverables\n\n### Audit & Mitigations\n\nGS will coordinate audits with Code Arena and another third party firm. We expect this to begin around July 3rd.\n\nGS will apply any mitigations to the code, and publish the smart contracts and all supporting software as open source code on Github.\n\nGS will also publish tutorials and documentation on how to use the above tools.\n\n### Deployment\n\nGS will deploy to Ethereum and Ethereum L2s, but we wish the community to help determine the order. We need to proceed one at a time as there is a significant amount of off-chain infrastructure, so each deployment will need to pass health checks before we launch the next. **It will be up to the community to launch vaults, so we will coordinate with you to determine the right launch sequence.**\n\nWe will deploy a production version of PT V5 to the following chains:\n\n- Optimism\n- Arbitrum\n- Ethereum\n- zkSync Era\n\nWe will deploy a production version of PT V5 to the following chain if mainnet is ready and our infrastructure (Defender) supports it:\n\n- Base\n\nRegardless of mainnet status, for all of the above we'll have testnet deployments.\n\nEach chain will have a similar sequence\n\n1. GS deploys core smart contracts and infrastructure for the new chain. The Prize Pool will be tuned for each chain it is deployed to.\n2. GS launches communications campaign to reach builders on that chain\n3. Community permissionlessly creates vaults\n4. GS runs health checks and moves on to next chain when successful.\n\n#### Deployment Details\n\nFor each new chain deployment:\n\n- GS will deploy the core smart contracts\n- GS will host an app to view and interact with the vaults\n- GS will host a vault factory app\n- GS will deploy supporting subgraphs\n- GS will ensure there are at least two compatible yield sources at launch, selected in collaboration with the community.\n\n**Note:** We will guarantee app and subgraph hosting until the end of 2023, but funding from future PTBRs will be required to keep them going beyond that date.\n\n#### Communications Campaign Details\n\nFor each chain, the GS team will build out a communications campaign to reach and activate partners, encouraging them to integrate yield sources, prize tokens and/or wallets. Successful campaigns will require... \n\n- Identifying the audiences we aim to reach (yield sources, protocols, token issuers, wallets) and creating a list of leads\n- Creating and distributing media including written and visual content for Medium, Mirror, Twitter, Discord and Lens.\n- Creating and distributing documentation for relevant to partners.\n- Conducting direct outreach to a list of potential partners\n\n#### Community Creates Vaults\n\nWe will support the community in launching new vaults. In particular:\n\n- Provide tutorials and documentation\n- Give guidance on which protocols would be good integrations\n- Offer assistance in the Discord #developers channel\n\n### Infrastructure\n\nAs mentioned above, there is a significant amount of off-chain infrastructure. Polish and refinement of the bots and subgraphs will continue beyond the launch date. We expect growing pains and needs to change as the system scales. By the end of September we'll have 1.0 releases for each piece of infrastructure, and will make them public, open source, and documented.\n\n- Liquidation Bot\n- Prize Claimer Bot\n- Draw Bot\n- Subgraph\n- App to view and navigate vaults\n- App to create vaults\n\n## Timeline\n\nNote that we will work with the community to determine the final chain order.\n\n| Date | Description |\n| ---- | ----------- |\n| July 17 | Completion of audit and mitigations |\n| July 24 | Launch of first chain (TBD) |\n| Aug 7 | Launch of second chain (TBD) |\n| Aug 14 | Launch of third chain (TBD) |\n| Aug 21 | Launch of fourth chain (TBD) |\n| Aug 28 | Launch of fifth chain (TBD) |\n| Sep 29 | 1.0 releases for infrastructure |\n\n# Budget\n\n| Amount | Token |\n| ------ | ----- |\n| 460,000 | USDC |",

This version will be a hyperstructure, as detailed in [this gov post](https://gov.pooltogether.com/t/the-pooltogether-prize-savings-hyperstructure/2753).\n\nOur moonshot goal is to get the hyperstructure into production.\n\n### Milestones\n\n1. Launch a new landing page for pooltogether.com\n2. Launch version 5 of the protocol: the hyperstructure\n\n#### Hyperstructure Launch Steps\n\nThe following is a breakdown of the hyperstructure launch timeline. Dates given are estimates, not hard commitments. We'll do our best.\n\n| Description | Estimated Completion Date |\n| ----------- | -------------- |\n| Initial design for the hyperstructure | **Complete** |\n| Launch alpha version on Sepolia. This includes both the smart contracts and a web app | April 1 |\n| Release code that allows anyone to liquidate yield and claim prizes | April 15 |\n| Launch beta version for final testing and polish | May 15 |\n| Code Audit | June 1 |\n| Launch new landing page | June 1 | \n| Launch the production version | June 15 |\n| Launch JS SDK | June 15 |\n| Develop an incentivized draw mechanism to ensure the prize pool is rewarded | July 15 |\n| Launch an ecosystem portal to surface third party apps | July 15 |\n| Install the draw mechanism and renounce ownership of the prize pool | August 1st |\n\n# Budget\n\n## Requested Amount\n\n| Token | Amount |\n| ----- | ----- |\n| POOL | 54,458 POOL |\n| USDC | 187,841 USDC |\n\n## Budget Breakdown\n\n### Team Members\n\nAs per [Q2 2023 Compensation Formula](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zkgljshTWmJke85LZqtlZYxmb6aZLoFQxeWx5q7mEPI/edit?usp=sharing).\n\n| Role | Yearly USD Compensation | Commitment Percentage | Quarterly USDC | Quarterly POOL | Contributor | Contributor Discord |\n| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |\n| Team Lead | $131,100 | 100% | $32,775 USDC | Covered until end of Q2 2023 | Brendan Asselstine | Brendan 🌊🏆#1830 |\n| Protocol Engineer | $211,166 | 100% | $34,750 USDC | 17,688 POOL | Pierrick Turelier | Pierrick#1350 |\n| Protocol Engineer | $202,000 | 100% | $33,936 USDC | 16,240 POOL | Dylan DesRosier | dylandesrosier#6262 |\n| Front-End Engineer | $131,100 | 80% | $26,220 USDC | Covered until middle of Q4 2023 | Chuck Bergeron | ChuckBergeron#2753 |\n| Senior Designer | $202,000 | 100% | $33,936 USDC | 16,240 POOL | Alex | alxx#6155 |\n| Junior Software Engineer | $100,000 | 100% | $20,625 USDC | 4,290 | Noah Cukiert | Ncookie#1619 |\n\n**Totals: 182,242 USDC & 54,458 POOL**\n\n## Team Expenses\n\nThe following are ballpark expenses for the quarter. Note that the security bounties are more of a reserve- if no exploits are reported it will rollover. Likewise for auditing, although our goal is to have the PT Hyperstructure on testnet and audited this quarter.\n\n| Description | Amount |\n| ----------- | ------ |\n| SAAS / Infra Services | $9000 |\n| Security Bounties | $50,000 | \n| Contractors | $20,000 |\n| Auditing | $250,000 |\n\n**Total: $329,000 USDC**\n\n# Retrospective\n\nThe previous PT Inc. Client team and PT Inc. Protocol team goals were to:\n\n- [x] V4 app updates \n- [x] Install VRF 2.0\n- [x] Upgrade V4 to use DPR\n- [x] Launch [DPR Controller App](https://tools.pooltogether.com/prize-tier-controller)\n- [ ] Launch new landing page\n- [ ] Launch hyperstructure testnet\n\nMost of these have been completed. The outstanding goals are to launch the hyperstructure and landing page, as detailed above.\n\n## Budget Surplus\n\n| Description | Amount | Token |\n| ------------- | ---------- | ---------- |\n| C4 outstanding account balance | 127,400 | USDC |\n| Held assets | 196,001 | ScUSDC |\n\n**Total: 323,401 USDC**\n\n# Appendix\n\n## Token Pricing\n\n| Token | value in USD |\n| ----- | ------------ |\n| POOL | 1.02 |",

We handle custody and transaction matters where directed by governance, such as claiming rewards, and receiving tokens on networks other than mainnet. We are the goto solution for maximum security custody for the community.\n\nWe will continue the custody of delegations for the Community Team, Grants, and SerHotMike. Custody continues to be $300k in total.\n\nWe continue with a custody limit of $750k to put a hard cap on our total custody. Activities that approach the cap will be brought forward as an alert. Any funds over that amount will need to be approved by a vote to change the cap. This gives the community a clear picture of what our custody risk is.\n\nGoals\nOur primary focus is security. We maintain a 7/11 multi-sig of senior contributors who are well versed in PoolTogether infrastructure, happenings, and the greater DeFi ecosystem.\n\nWe look to act in a timely and efficient manner to ensure prize liquidity never runs dry, and that Pooler and treasury funds are safe.\n\nThese pillars form our goals\n\nSecurity\nNo loss. We strive to never lose funds. This is an easily evaluated metric we strive to maintain.\n\nActing on governance directives\nA quarterly team survey evaluates our performance alignment with governance directives. The executive-team aligns with the council. Any concerns from the community are encouraged.\n\nEnsuring prize delivery\nPrizes promised are prizes delivered. We strive for no failed prize claims due to a lack of prize liquidity.\n\nActing in an organized and efficient way.\nA new procedure is being introduced to outline execution time expectations. Transactions will be presented by lead as having a standard 24hr time to sign and execute. Transactions requiring more immediate attention will be presented with a 12hr time to sign and execute. The team will strive to always meet these deadlines and missed time windows will be reported at quarters end.\n\nRead more RFC https://gov.pooltogether.com/t/rfc-tbr-q2-2023-executive-team/2818",

Pooltogether Executive team will swap the DAI for stETH and deposit $150,000 USD equivalent into the steth.win pool as sponsorship. The stETH sponsorship tokens and the remaining stETH will be sent back to Pooltogether treasury.\n\n### Motivations and Reasoning\nPooltogether’s treasury holdings are mostly stablecoins and POOL with the stablecoins earning a very low rate of return and tied to the price of the USD which gives limited upside. More exposure to ETH is something that has been brought up several times by the community but we’ve not pulled the trigger. We’ve also had a stETH pool recently launched by @underthesea, with 50% of the proceeds going to charity and the remainder to 2 winning depositors. This pool already has had 12 stETH in sponsorship added by Witnet. We’d like to support this community pool while increasing our ETH exposure. Recent discussions and polls on the forum have shown majority support for both increasing ETH exposure and sponsoring the community built stETH pool. See the conversations here: https://gov.pooltogether.com/t/rfc-convert-489k-dai-balance-to-steth-and-deposit-as-sponsorship-into-steth-pool-on-pooltogether/2730\nThis proposal has been decreased from the original proposed amount of $489K to satisfy the wishes of many community members to do a lesser amount. My intention is that in the event that ETH price drops in the coming months I would potentially propose some more buys with the remaining DAI.\n\nHaving this transaction done by the Executive team will simplify the process and the funds will only be in the custody of the Executive team for a short time. The Executive team multisig is a 7/11 signature safe and is capable of handling this dollar amount and transactions with no issues.\n\n### Technical Specification\nContract aDAI 0x028171bCA77440897B824Ca71D1c56caC55b68A3\nExec-Team Safe 0xDa63D70332139E6A8eCA7513f4b6E2E0Dc93b693\nTransfer 250000000000000000000000\n",

      "title": "PTIP-83: PoolTogether V4 DPR Upgrade",
      "content": "**tldr; vote YES to upgrade PoolTogether V4 to support large, infrequent prizes**\n\nThe PoolTogether Inc. team, in collaboration with the Finance Team, has nearly completed the research and development for the V4 \"Draw Percentage Rate\" upgrade. We are now ready to begin rolling out the upgrade. In this post I'll briefly describe the DPR, run through the rollout plan, and finally link to a POOL Snapshot vote that authorizes the Executive Team to upgrade V4.\n\nThe DPR is the final step in PT Inc's plan to further decentralize V4. You can read more about the whole process in the [PT Inc. Protocol Team Q4 2022 TBR](https://gov.pooltogether.com/t/tbr-q4-2022-pt-inc-protocol-team/2576#decentralizing-v4-4).\n\n# Draw Percentage Rate\n\n**tldr; the DPR allows us to have large, infrequent prizes**\n\nCurrently, prizes are awarded in daily draws. The Finance Team sets the total daily prize amount and how that amount is split across prize \"tiers\". Each tier has a certain number of prizes, so the Finance Team may decide to allocate 10% to tier 0 (the grand prize) and 90% to tier 7 (where there are 128 prizes).\n\nThe problem with the current model is that we can't allocate a portion of the yield to more irregular prizes; to prizes that may occur once per week, for example. This limits our ability to have \"headline prizes\"; giant prizes.\n\nThe upgrade improves on this by introducing the draw percentage rate.  The DPR adjust the odds of prizes occurring to ensure that, on average, the prizes will match the expected returns. This is best illustrated with an example!\n\nLet's say:\n\n- Prizes area allocated in daily draws\n- The TVL for a prize pool is $1m\n- The total prize amount is $10,000\n- The DPR is 0.000274\n\nThe Draw Percentage Rate tunes the prize odds so that the daily prizes approximately equal the expected returns.\n\n```\nExpected Returns = DPR * TVL\nExpected Returns = 0.000274 * $1m = $274\n```\n\nThe total prize amount is $10,000 so we can calculate the odds adjustment like so:\n\n```\nOdds adjustment = Expected Returns / Total prize amount\nOdds adjustment = $274 / $10,000\nOdds adjustment = 0.0274\n```\n\nThis means that the odds of all prizes will be scaled by 0.0274. The daily grand prize will only occur every (1/0.0274) or 36.5 days.\n\nThe added benefit of the DPR is that prizes will adjust based on the TVL. As long as the underlying yield APR remains the same, the prize distribution needs to be adjusted far less frequently.\n\n# Rollout Plan\n\nWe're going to roll out the upgrade progressively, in order to minimize risk and ensure there is minimal disruption to prize claiming. The upgrade may cause delays in the ability to claim, but it will not stop prize distribution.\n\nNote that these dates are tentative! If there are roadblocks we will progress more slowly, and if the rollout progresses smoothly we can move faster.\n\n| Date | Description |\n| ---- | ----------- |\n| January 3rd | Finance Team finalizes new prize distribution utilizing the DPR |\n| January 3rd | Avalanche V4 deployment is upgraded to use the DPR |\n| January 5th | Ethereum V4 deployment is upgraded to use the DPR |\n| January 9th | Polygon V4 deployment is upgraded to use the DPR |\n| January 11th | Optimism V4 deployment is upgraded to use the DPR |\n\n# Vote\n\nThis is a protocol-wide upgrade that requires the authorization of the POOL token holders. Because the Executive Team is acting on behalf of the POOL holders, we will conduct a gasless Snapshot vote to signal approval of the upgrade. If you hold POOL tokens anywhere, then please vote!\n\n# Summary\n\nWe endeavour to make this upgrade transparent, seamless, and valuable. If you have any questions about the concepts or process please don't hesitate to reach out on Discord.",

Client Team** |\n| Quarter and Year | **Q1 2023** |\n| Payout Address | **0x3927E0642C432A934a4EAA64C79bC8a1D8ac5Fb7** |\n| Total USD Value Requested | **$45,136.31 USD** |\n\n# Purpose\n\n   The PoolTogether Inc. Client team is responsible for providing client support for the protocol. This includes maintaining and expanding the flagship consumer interface at app.pooltogether.com and developing additional dapps on tools.pooltogether.com and vote.pooltogether.com. The Client team is also building tooling for developers to easily build on top of the protocol with things like tutorials, SDKs and APIs.\n\n# Goals\n    \n1. **Explore PoolTogether Ecosystem**\n    Exploring the PoolTogether ecosystem is too difficult and needs to be reworked. An updated version of the current landing page at <https://tools.pooltogether.com> will be designed and developed to highlight the possibilities of the protocol, existing interfaces and tools for the protocol and ways to build on top of the protocol.\n    \n    **Deliverable:** A redesigned Protocol Ecosystem landing page.\n    \n2. **Protocol Landing Page**\n    An updated landing page for the protocol with more of a \"protocol focus\" and less of a \"product focus\". We want to highlight governance, protocol features and the DAO more and focus less on the singular interface located at <https://app.pooltogether.com>. Some examples of \"protocol focused\" landing pages are: Liquity, Lido, Uniswap and Aave.\n    \n    **Deliverable:** A redesigned Protocol landing page.\n    \n3. **PoolTogether V4 App Maintenance & Bugs**\n    While it's fully functional there's always optimizations, upgrades and inevitable bugs. We will continue to maintain and improve the existing interface.\n    \n4. **Hiring**\n    The client team is looking to hire 1 full time engineer to help work across the stack on the various interfaces and infrastructure used by the client team and external developers. As Dylan transitions to the protocol team we will need more front end developer bandwith to help with the upcoming goals.\n    \n**Stretch Goals**\n    \n    \n5. **PoolTogether Hyperstructure Interface Alpha**\n    In conjunction with the protocol team the client team will provide a new interface for the next version of the protocol. As of now, the new interface will be more of an admin interface and less of a consumer app. We will be prioritizing functionality and simplicity for of development over user experience (it'll still be pretty though).\n    \n    **Deliverable:** No guaranteed deliverable. Depends on external factors.\n    \n6. **PoolTogether Hyperstructure Tools Alpha**\n    With the new protocol design several mini apps (tools) will be required to interact with specific pieces of the protocol. The client team will provide intuitive interfaces for each mechanism. An example from last quarter that will be expanded upon is the [liquidator](https://tools.pooltogether.com/liquidator) (NOTE: set the app to developer mode to access.)\n    \n    **Deliverable:** No guaranteed deliverable. Depends on external factors.\n    \n8. **PoolTogether Hyperstructure SDK Alpha**\n    A Typescript SDK will be developed alongside the interface. This SDK will provide a simple way for developers to build on top of the protocol without needing to know the low level details of the protocol. Some priorities are: simplicity and customizability. Tutorials and documentation will be provided similar to the existing `v4-client-js`. \n    \n    **Deliverable:** No guaranteed deliverable. Depends on external factors.\n\n# Budget\n\n## Requested Amount\n\n| Amount | Token |\n| ----- | ----- |\n| 67,083.56 | POOL |\n\n## Budget Breakdown\n\n### Team Members\n\n| Role | Yearly USD Compensation | Commitment Percentage | Quarterly USDC | Quarterly POOL | Contributor | Contributor Discord |\n| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |\n| Senior Designer | $145,000 | 100% | 0 (covered by PT Inc.) | 16,811 | Alex | alxx#6155 |\n| Software Engineer | $202,000 | 100% | 0 (covered by PT Inc.) | 24,618.14 | Dylan DesRosier | dylandesrosier#6262 |\n| Junior Software Engineer | $100,000 | 100% | 0 (covered by PT Inc.) | 6,502.32 | Noah Cukiert | Ncookie#1619 |\n| Senior Software Engineer | $250,000 | 100% | 0 (covered by PT Inc.) | 37,156.10 | **Open Role** |  |\n\nThe maximum POOL salary for the open position is being requested (see the [compensation formula spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zkgljshTWmJke85LZqtlZYxmb6aZLoFQxeWx5q7mEPI/edit#gid=0))) to keep the door open for high quality candidates. If we do not hire this quarter, we will roll the tokens over to next quarter. If we decide we don’t need to fill the role, we will return the tokens. If we hire they will likely be below the max, so we will return or roll over the remaining tokens.\n\n### Team Expenses\n\nAdditional expenses are currently being covered by PT Inc.\n\n# Retrospective\n\n## Q4 2022 Goals\n\n1. **Core App Redesign**\n   The interface found at <https://app.pooltogether.com> was overhauled, all code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/pooltogether/v4-ui).\n\n2. **V5 App Alpha**\n    An alpha version was [built](https://github.com/pooltogether/v4-ui/pull/68) but has been halted. There is more work being done designing the protocol and the UI comes second. Alongside the core app alpha some additional mini apps (tools) were required. A liquidator implementation is available [here](https://tools.pooltogether.com/liquidator).\n  \n3. **V5 JS SDK**\n   An alpha version was [built](https://github.com/pooltogether/v4-client-js/tree/new-tokenomics-alpha) but has been halted.  There is more work being done designing the protocol and the JS SDK comes second. \n   \n4. **V3 App Deprecation**\n   The [v3 interface](https://v3.pooltogether.com) was deprecated. Support for all features from the v3 site are available on <https://app.pooltogether.com> and <https://tools.pooltogether.com>.\n   \n5. **Hiring**\n    One engineering position was filled, another engineering position is still open. We also hired a Senior Designer earlier than anticipated so we've redirected the unfilled positions POOL to them.\n\n## Budget Surplus\n\n**18,004 POOL**\n\n- 25,373.03 - 7,369 POOL\n    These tokens are from the unfilled Software Engineer position will be rolled over this quarter and subtracted from the total requested amount as the position is still open. However, due to hiring a Senior Designer that wasn't initially planned for Q4 we've repurposed these funds to handle their POOL allocation. The rate used is the same as what is being requested in this document and was pro-rated to their start date for the quarter.\n\n\n# Appendix\n\n## Token Pricing\n\n| Token | USD |\n| ---- | ---- |\n| USDC | $1 |\n| POOL | $0.6728370667 |",

There have been great tutorials from users like @thumbsupfinance & Kris Kay (Defi Donut) in the past. We hope to emulate this while also updating, maintaining & translating our content. We will help crypto natives & those new to crypto find the smoothest route to go from fiat to ptUSDC. These could vary greatly between different countries and user preferences (self custody vs custodial), we hope to provide understanding which will empower users to choose the best route to deposit for them.\n\nWe hope to achieve this through providing comprehensive, structured and easy to understand tutorials as well as live support. The live support could be specific hours team members spend in the #help channel of the discord as well as private voice chats / support within the PT discord.\n\n**Goals**\n\nCreate a knowledge foundation of crypto for users to easily understand and use PoolTogether\n\nCreate & maintain guides for onboarding depositors\n\nProvide Live support for users\n\nBonus goal to pursue if we deem 1-3 to be performed to our expectations:\n\nEducate Users on how to stay safe when navigating crypto\n\nExpense Budget\nTeam Members $21,404\nCoordinape $5,000\nBounties $3,000\nTools / Subscriptions $200\nTotal $29,604\n\nFor a more detailed breakdown of our goals & reasoning please visit our governance post https://gov.pooltogether.com/t/rfc-tbr-q1-2023-education-onboarding-team/2669",

We handle custody and transaction matters where directed by governance, such as claiming rewards, and receiving tokens on networks other than mainnet. We are the goto solution for maximum security custody for the community.\n\nWe will continue the custody of delegations for the Community Team, Grants, and SerHotMike. Custody continues to be $300k in total.\n\nWe continue with a custody limit of $750k to put a hard cap on our total custody. Activities that approach the cap will be brought forward as an alert. Any funds over that amount will need to be approved by a vote to change the cap. This gives the community a clear picture of what our custody risk is.\n\nMore info on https://gov.pooltogether.com/t/rfc-tbr-q1-2023-executive-team/2667\n",

We handle custody and transaction matters where directed by governance, such as claiming rewards, and receiving tokens on networks other than mainnet. We are the goto solution for maximum security custody for the community.\n\nWe will take on a new task of custodying delegation funds for L2s. This proposal includes 300k USDC which will be represented by Grants Team (100k), Community Team (100k) and SerHotMike for the growth team. Delegation funds will be separate from prize liquidity for clarity and deposited to the multi-delegator or as undelegated tickets. This operation has the side benefit of increased prize generation for sponsorship funds that are not delegated.\n\nNote: We shall introduce a custody limit of $750k for this quarter to put a hard cap on our total custody. Activities that approach the cap will be brought forward as an alert. Any funds over that amount will need to be approved by a vote to change the cap. This gives the community a clear picture of what our custody risk is.\n\nGoals\nOur primary focus is security. We maintain a 7/11 multi-sig of senior contributors who are well versed in PoolTogether infrastructure, happenings, and the greater DeFi ecosystem.\n\nWe look to act in a timely and efficient manner to ensure prize liquidity never runs dry, and that Pooler and treasury funds are safe.\n\nThese pillars form our goals\n\nSecurity\nNo loss. We strive to never lose funds. This is an easily evaluated metric we strive to maintain.\n\nActing on governance directives\nA quarterly team survey evaluates our performance alignment with governance directives. The executive-team aligns with the council. Any concerns from the community are encouraged.\n\nEnsuring prize delivery\nPrizes promised are prizes delivered. We strive for no failed prize claims due to a lack of prize liquidity.\n\nActing in an organized and efficient way.\nA new procedure is being introduced to outline execution time expectations. Transactions will be presented by lead as having a standard 24hr time to sign and execute. Transactions requiring more immediate attention will be presented with a 12hr time to sign and execute. The team will strive to always meet these deadlines and missed time windows will be reported at quarters end.\n\n",

      "content": "https://gov.pooltogether.com/t/rfc-tbr-q4-2022-finance-team/2573\n\n# TBR-Q4-2022 - Finance Team\n\n| | |\n| --------- | ---------- |\n| Team Name | **Finance Team** |\n| Quarter and Year | **Q4 2022** |\n| Payout Address | **0xB74659A1011F6DCA3BA6F6e22a71bA8f414F36A1** |\n| Total USD Value Requested | **$44,250 USD** |\n\n# Purpose\n\nThe Finance team serves as a continuation of the previous Treasury Work Group and Interim Prize Team. The core purposes from these teams has always been to:\n\n* Ensure safety and prudence go into every decision\n\n* Drive future protocol growth\n\n* Identify sustainable solutions\n\n* Present objective data to the community\n\nAcquiring these same values, the Finance team will specially focus on DAO sustainability and transparency. With the DAO growth and the creation of multiple independent teams, the Finance team can offer a holistic view of the DAO to bring clarity on a financial perspective.\n\nAlso, with V5 on its way, new opportunities, assets and yield sources will come to the protocol. The Finance team should provide a recommendation on the new elements to make sure that the DAO is able to make informed decisions.\n\nFinally, the Finance team will monitor and implement changes to prize distributions with the purpose of growing the protocol in a sustainable manner. Example duties: monitoring prize data and sentiment, adjusting prizes and optimizing prize distributions to create the best user experience.\n\n# Goals\n\nAligned with the previously mentioned purposes, the Finance Team would have the following goals:\n\n**1. Quarterly review of DAO inflows/outflows**\n\nAs the DAO is expanding and attracting more contributors, a detailed view of incomes and expenses is required to determine the runway of the DAO and be able to plan accordingly.\n\nA quarterly report will be published giving specific and objective information on the inflows/outflows of the DAO.\n\n**2. Asset Management Analysis**\n\nProtocol’s Treasury can provide a significant yield to help achieve sustainability. Due to Governor Alpha constraints, the options from which yield could be obtained have been limited in the past. With more innovation coming to DeFi and other options to explore, the Finance team should look for safe opportunities to be able to get yield on the DAOs assets.\n\nWith the top priority of keeping funds in control of the governance contract, at least 3 different yield strategies will be presented to the DAO.\n\n**3. Protocol-Owned Liquidity solutions**\n\nGiven that the protocol is about to deploy liquidity on mainnet Uniswap V3, the team is committed to keep an eye on both this new deployment and the previous Polygon POL. It is also required to explore the possibilities to encourage depositors to migrate from Uniswap V2 to V3.\n\nAt least 1 alternative will be presented to the DAO to encourage Uniswap V2 LPers to migrate to Uniswap V3.\n\n**4. Prize distribution**\n\nPrizes are the main attraction of PoolTogether, so it is important to use them as effectively as possible to grow the protocol.\n\nMoving to weekly prizes is the main objective, as we consider that this will help unlock bigger prizes which will end up attracting more users. While doing this, we also plan to maintain sustainable prizes and keep the balance between yield inflows and prize outflows. Prize subsidy will be considered where a clear vision for growth is outlined and can be evaluated empirically for success.\n\nThe Finance Team will also build and maintain utilities (Node, Discord, WebApps, Dune) to monitor and measure prize results.\n\n# Budget\n\n## Requested Amount\n\n| Amount | Token |\n| ----- | ----- |\n| 37,170 | USDC |\n| 7,185 | POOL |\n\n## Budget Breakdown\n\n### Team Members\n\n| Role | Yearly USD Compensation | Commitment Percentage | Quarterly USDC | Quarterly POOL | Contributor | Contributor Discord |\n| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |\n| Lead | $90,000 | 55% | 10,395 | 2,010 | underthesea | underthesea#4658 |\n| Member & Communications | $90,000 | 55% | 10,395 | 2,010 | BRONDER | BRONDER#4788 |\n| Accountant / Member | | | 5,460 | 1,055 | **Open Role** | |\n| Prize Analyst / Member | | | 5,460 | 1,055 | **Open Role** | |\n| Temporary Consultant | | | 5,460 | 1,055 | **Open Role** | |\n\nIn order to cover open roles we are looking for persons with experience in accounting, research or analytics, and expertise in liquidity and risk analysis. Those will be covered on specific occasions with a maximum budget of $6,500 per role.\n\n### Team Expenses\n\nNo expenses.\n\n## Previous Budget Surplus\n\nThe Finance team inherits the 3 out of 6 multisig previously used by the TWG (BraveNewDefi, BRONDER, DaBoom, drcpu, TheRealTuna, underthesea). As a consequence, the team inherits the existing budget for transactional costs kept safely in the gnosis safe amounting to:\n\n| Description | Amount | Token |\n| ----- | ----- | ----- |\nETH for Operations | 2.19 | ETH |\n\n\nThe Finance team will also inherit the UNI V3 positions on Polygon. However, as the team has become significantly smaller, the UNI V3 positions on Polygon should be migrated to the Exec-team for custody.\n\nRegarding the previous Prize team, the Finance team will inherit and maintain the previous 3 out of 5 multisig (BRONDER, Dylan, Leighton, Ncookie, underthesea). The other 3 members outside of the Finance team will be kept as informal advisors. This will allow us to move relatively fast in events of big yield changes or other unforeseen needs to adapt the prizes. This multisig does not custody any additional funds.\n\nThere is currently ~$225,000 USDC in prize liquidity reserves that can be used as subsidy for Q4.\n\nAll of the funds not used at the end of the quarter will be rolled over to the next quarter if the team is renewed. If not renewed, all leftover funds will be returned to the PoolTogether Treasury.\n\n# Appendix\n\n## Token Pricing\n\n| Token | USD |\n| ---- | ---- |\n| ETH | $1,300 |\n| USDC | $1 |\n| POOL | $0.985298 |",

Client team is responsible for providing client support for the protocol. This includes maintaining and expanding the flagship consumer interface at app.pooltogether.com and developing additional dapps on tools.pooltogether.com and vote.pooltogether.com. The Client team is also building tooling for developers to easily build on top of the protocol with things like tutorials, SDKs and APIs.\n\n# Goals\n\n1. **Core App Redesign**\n\n   The interface found at app.pooltogether.com is in need of an update. The app started as a prototype and grew into the production app. The team has paid a Designer for a complete redesign and will be implementing this. The goal of the redesign is to be more approachable for new comers while maintaining the same (and more) level of details. Along with that, the redesign sets up the application for expanding to many more prize pools (deposit tokens, yield sources)\n\n   **Deliverable:** Deploy redesigned app in Q4\n\n2. **V5 App Alpha**\n\n   The client team has been developing an Alpha version of the app for the proposed V5 of PoolTogether. This will allow the community to have a more tangible way of testing the proposed changes. The team is working closely with the Protocol team to ensure a smooth transition from V4 to V5 in the future.\n\n   **Deliverable:** Deploy alpha app in Q4\n   \n3. **V5 JS SDK**\n\n   Alongside the alpha app, the client team will release alpha versions of @pooltogether/v4-client-js for interacting with the V5 protocol.\n\n   **Deliverable:** Deploy V5 JS SDK\n   \n4. **V3 App Deprecation**\n\n   Unfortunately the existing V3 app is expensive and difficult to maintain. To prepare for shutting down that UI we need alternative UIs for users to: withdraw & claim rewards.\n\n   **Deliverable:** Deprecate V3 app\n   **Deliverable:** Deploy V3 mini apps\n   \n5. **Hiring**\n\n    The PoolTogether client team is looking to hire 1 full time engineer to help work across the stack on the various interfaces and infrastructure used by the client team and external developers.\n\n   **Deliverable:** Hire a full time engineer\n\n# Budget\n\n## Requested Amount\n\n| Amount | Token |\n| ----- | ----- |\n| 46,624.47 | POOL |\n\n## Budget Breakdown\n\n### Team Members\n\n| Role | Yearly USD Compensation | Commitment Percentage | Quarterly USDC | Quarterly POOL | Contributor | Contributor Discord |\n| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |\n| Software Engineer | $202,000 | 100% | 0 (covered by PT Inc.) | 16,811.16 | Dylan DesRosier | dylandesrosier#6262 |\n| Junior Software Engineer | $100,000 | 100% | 0 (covered by PT Inc.) | 4,440.28 | Noah Cukiert | Ncookie#1619 |\n| Software Engineer | $250,000 | 100% | 0 (covered by PT Inc.) | 25,373.03 | **Open Role** |  |\n\nThe maximum POOL salary for the open position is being requested ( see the [compensation formula spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zkgljshTWmJke85LZqtlZYxmb6aZLoFQxeWx5q7mEPI/edit#gid=0))) to keep the door open for high quality candidates.

This includes:\n\n- Designing and developing upgrades to the protocol\n- Working with partners to support protocol integrations\n- Implementing security best practices to ensure the protocol is safe\n- Automating operational transactions to ensure the protocol runs smoothly\n\n## Merging Existing Teams\n\nThere are two existing \"teams\" that the protocol team will include: the Ethereum Operations Team and the informal security team.\n\nThe existing Ethereum Operations Team will be turned into the Protocol Team, with the only two active members being Brendan and Pierrick. The Eth Ops Team currently holds ~$250k in USDC held directly and across two Sablier streams. These funds will be re-purposed for use by the Protocol Team, and the other two signers on the multisig will be removed.\n\nThe informal security team is really just Brendan's relationship with Code Arena. Several PTIPs in the past have transferred funds to Code Arena to top-up an account used for PT protocol audits. The account is used to fund core protocol changes, and the current balance is ~$156k USDC. Brendan will be leading the protocol team, so this account will be re-purposed as the auditing account for the Protocol Team.\n\n# Q4 2022 Performance Goals and Metrics\n\nOver the next three months, the protocol team plans to improve the core PoolTogether V4. We will:\n\n- Upgrade PoolTogether V4 to make it fully decentralized\n- Continue research and development of V5\n- Hire a additional developer\n\n## Decentralizing V4\n\nThe PoolTogether protocol version 4 currently uses OpenZeppelin Defender relayers to copy information from one chain to another. This means that if someone takes control of Defender they can manipulate the protocol. We wish to upgrade the protocol so that Defender is simply automating functions that can be called by anyone.\n\nThere are several parts to the upgrade:\n\n1. Replace Draw oracle with bridges and local VRFs. [ERC-5164](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-5164) is part of our efforts.\n2. Replace TVL oracle by upgrading V4 to use the [Draw Percentage Rate](https://gov.pooltogether.com/t/pt-v4-1-draw-percentage-rate-dpr/1911). This eliminates the need to broadcast the TVL across all chains.\n3. Eliminate Timelocks. By eliminating the above attack vectors, we can improve the user experience.\n\n### Milestones\n\n1. Install VRF 2.0 on Polygon\n2. Bridge draws trustlessly to Optimism (via [ERC-5164](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-5164))\n3. Install VRF 2.0 on Avalanche\n4. Upgrade V4 Ethereum to use DPR\n5. Upgrade V4 Polygon to use DPR\n6. Upgrade V4 Optimism to use DPR\n7. Upgrade V4 Avalanche to use DPR\n\n## PoolTogether V5\n\nWith V4 locked down, we'll be able to continue work on PoolTogether V5. This new version will extend the excellent V4 prize design with strong tokenomics that incentivize protocol growth. We will also be focusing on making the protocol **permissionless** and **autonomous**. This way no one needs to ask governance permission to extend the protocol, and we will reduce the number of PTIPs required to manage the protocol.\n\n**Performance Milestones:**\n- finalize V5 design\n- deliver a public V5 testnet\n\n## Hire Developers\n\nTo realize these goals, we'll need more developers. Another goal will be to hire another developer so that we can build faster.\n\n**Goal: hire another protocol engineer**\n\n# Budget\n\n## Requested Amount\n\n| Total |\n| ----- |\n| 43683.68 POOL |\n\n## To Be Returned\n\n| Total |\n| ----- |\n| 156,400 ScUSDC |\n\n## Budget Breakdown\n\n### Team Members\n\nList every role on the team with the following template:\n\n| Role | Yearly USD Compensation | Commitment Percentage | Quarterly USDC | Quarterly POOL | Contributor | Contributor Discord |\n| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |\n| Team Lead | N/A | 100% | 0 (covered by PT Inc) | 0 | Brendan Asselstine | Brendan 🌊🏆#1830 |\n| Protocol Engineer | $211,166 | 100% | 0 (covered by PT Inc) | 18,310.65 | Pierrick Turelier | Pierrick#1350 |\n| Protocol Engineer | $250,000 (max) | 100% | 0 (covered by PT Inc) | 25,373.03 | **Open Role** | |\n\nWe will be hiring a Protocol Engineer this quarter, so we want to be ready with compensation. The above POOL is the maximum possible quarterly ownership for an employee (see the [compensation formula spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zkgljshTWmJke85LZqtlZYxmb6aZLoFQxeWx5q7mEPI/edit#gid=0)) If we do not hire this quarter, we will roll the tokens over to next quarter.  If we decide we don't need to fill the role, we will return the tokens. If we hire they will likely be below the max, so we will return or roll over the remaining tokens.\n\n## Previous Budget Surplus\n\nThe Protocol Team will inherit a significant amount of budget from the Ethereum Operations Team and Brendan's relationship with Code Arena. I estimate this budget will be sufficient for Q4 stablecoin expenses, and beyond.\n\n| Description | Amount | Token |\n| ------------- | ---------- | ---------- |\n| C4 outstanding account balance | 156,400 | USDC |\n| Held assets | 320,000 | ScUSDC |\n| Remaining in stream | 30,000 | ScUSDC |\n\nNote: Token prices at time of budget request are used for standardization. For simplicity the relevant token prices are provided below.\n\n# Appendix\n\n## Token Pricing\n\nShow the token prices used for any USD calculations.\n\n| Token | USD |\n| ---- | ---- |\n| POOL | 0.985298 |",

      "content": "#PTIP-80\n\n##Simple Summary\nWe are looking to take advantage of all the assets in the PoolTogether DAO Treasury, by selling them for ETH or getting yield from them.\n\n##Abstract\nThis proposal will send the following assets from the Treasury to the TWG Multisig to be sold and returned to the Treasury:\nUNI (for ETH)\nSUSHI (for ETH)\nBADGER (for ETH)\nCOMP (for ETH)\nAVAX (for ETH)\nTRIBE (for ETH)\nGAL (for ETH)\n\nWe will also stake the following assets (through working with the Exec Team):\nMATIC\nAAVE\n\nThe AVAX should be sent from the Exec Team to The Treasury Working group to be liquidated\n\n##Motivation\nAfter managing the stable assets from the treasury, it was the turn for non-stable assets. Instead of just holding all of the tokens, it was time for the DAO to select those that can have a long term impact and get some yield on them (or hold them). Whereas less meaningful assets will be sold for ETH.\n\nGiven the value of the assets being sold (less than $30K) and to simplify smart contract interactions (more than 10 transactions are required, so 2 PTIPs would be required if everything was done through the Governor Alpha contract), instead of doing all of the transactions through the Governor Alpha, the Treasury Working Group will take care of selling the assets for ETH and returning the obtained ETH to the Treasury.\n\n##Technical Specification\nOn-chain transactions to be performed in PTIP-80:\n\nWithdraw UNI from V3 Reserve\n\tContract: 0xd1797d46c3e825fce5215a0259d3426a5c49455c\n\tfunction: WithdrawReserve()\n\tfrom \"prizePool\": 0x0650d780292142835f6ac58dd8e2a336e87b4393\n\tto: 0x42cd8312d2bce04277dd5161832460e95b24262e\n\nWithdraw SUSHI from V3 Reserve\n\tContract: 0xd1797d46c3e825fce5215a0259d3426a5c49455c\n\tfunction: WithdrawReserve()\n\tfrom \"prizePool\": 0xc32a0f9dfe2d93e8a60ba0200e033a59aec91559\n\tto: 0x42cd8312d2bce04277dd5161832460e95b24262e\n\nWithdraw  BADGER from V3 Reserve\nContract: 0xd1797d46c3e825fce5215a0259d3426a5c49455c\n\tfunction: WithdrawReserve()\n\tfrom \"prizePool\": 0xc2a7Dfb76E93d12a1bB1Fa151b9900158090395d\n\tto: 0x42cd8312d2bce04277dd5161832460e95b24262e\n\nWithdraw COMP from V3 Reserve\n\tContract: 0xd1797d46c3e825fce5215a0259d3426a5c49455c\n\tfunction: WithdrawReserve()\n\tfrom \"prizePool\": 0xbc82221e131c082336cf698f0ca3ebd18afd4ce7\n\tto: 0x42cd8312d2bce04277dd5161832460e95b24262e\n\nSend 856.37 UNI from Governance Timelock to TWG Multisig\nContract: 0x1f9840a85d5aF5bf1D1762F925BDADdC4201F984\nfunction: transfer()\nfrom:  0x42cd8312d2bce04277dd5161832460e95b24262e\nto: 0xB74659A1011F6DCA3BA6F6e22a71bA8f414F36A1\namount:  856372424846341926258\n\nSend 3,284.53 SUSHI from Governance Timelock to TWG Multisig\nContract: 0x6B3595068778DD592e39A122f4f5a5cF09C90fE2\nfunction: transfer()\nfrom:  0x42cd8312d2bce04277dd5161832460e95b24262e\nto: 0xB74659A1011F6DCA3BA6F6e22a71bA8f414F36A1\namount: 3284532343089035803483\n\nSend 122.03 BADGER from Governance Timelock to TWG Multisig\nContract: 0x3472A5A71965499acd81997a54BBA8D852C6E53d\nfunction: transfer()\nfrom:  0x42cd8312d2bce04277dd5161832460e95b24262e\nto: 0xB74659A1011F6DCA3BA6F6e22a71bA8f414F36A1\namount: 122038867515372212081\n\nSend COMP from Governance Timelock to TWG Multisig\nContract: 0xc00e94Cb662C3520282E6f5717214004A7f26888\nfunction: transfer()\nfrom:  0x42cd8312d2bce04277dd5161832460e95b24262e\nto: 0xB74659A1011F6DCA3BA6F6e22a71bA8f414F36A1\namount: 281600941575265376483\n\nSend 41,257.89 TRIBE from Governance Timelock to TWG Multisig\nContract: 0xc7283b66Eb1EB5FB86327f08e1B5816b0720212B\nfunction: transfer()\nfrom:  0x42cd8312d2bce04277dd5161832460e95b24262e\nto: 0xB74659A1011F6DCA3BA6F6e22a71bA8f414F36A1\namount: 41257897178145893659381\n\nSend GAL from Governance Timelock to TWG Multisig\nContract: 0x5fAa989Af96Af85384b8a938c2EdE4A7378D9875\nFunction: transfer()\nFrom: 0x42cd8312d2bce04277dd5161832460e95b24262e\nTo: 0xB74659A1011F6DCA3BA6F6e22a71bA8f414F36A1\nAmount: 1500000000000000000000\nOff-chain transactions to be performed in PTIP-77 from TWG:\n\nApprove UNI\n\nApprove SUSHI\n\nApprove BADGER\n\nApprove COMP\n\nApprove TRIBE\n\nSell UNI for ETH\n\nSell SUSHI for ETH\n\nSell BADGER for ETH\n\nSell COMP for ETH\n\nSell TRIBE for ETH\n\nSell GAL for ETH\n\nSend ETH to Governance Timelock\n\n",

We strongly encourage you to check out the grants we’ve funded, which you can find in our monthly Medium articles 3.\n\nLast season, we experimented a lot with grants for delegations as an alternative to direct payments. This has been very successful! Examples include the NFT Christmas cards, the Valentine’s delegation NFT giveaway and the prizes for PoolStreaks.\n\nWe’re also supporting new initiatives by the community, such as the PoolTogether community podcast and substack 1. Another highlight was jumpstarting the Pooltogether Bounties, which are currently running hot preparing Pooltogether’s launch on Optimism.\n\nIn S2Q1, we funded grants to the amount of $88.5k and spent $15.6k on committee wages and expenses.\nIn S2Q2, we funded grants to the amount of $89.6k and spent $12k on committee wages and expenses.\n\nWe started out the last quarter with 102k POOL @$2.44 ($250k), which continually fell in Dollar value, leading to a tighter budget than anticipated.\n\nSpecification\nThe committee multisigs currently hold about $24k worth of POOL (@$0.87) and 199k USDC, across Ethereum and Polygon. We have $57k committed to open grant milestones that have not been paid out. For the first quarter of season 3, we are applying for $226k in POOL and 51k USDC in additional funding, to bring us back to a total of $500k as outlined in PTIP-14. Any amount left over at the end of the first quarter will again be rolled over to the next quarter’s funding.\nApproving this PTIP is meant to signal intent to fund both quarter 1 and 2 of season 3. The budget for quarter 2 will be requested at the end of quarter 1 through a separate PTIP, in order to limit the funds available in the multisigs at any given time.\n\nTransparency\nAs we are funded by Pooltogether governance, it is important to us that we are transparent about what we are doing. You can find our transparency resources ranging from funded projects and updates to member timesheets below. If there is anything you would like to see improved in this area, please let us know.\n\nMedium Articles & Updates - PoolGrants 3\n\nFunded Projects - Funded projects 3\n\nCommittee Time Tracking - Committee time tracking 1\n\nCommittee Members\nThe PoolGrants committee members for Season 3 will be:\n\nLead: @Torgin (continuing)\nDeputy Lead: @gabor (continuing)\n\nReviewers:\n@McOso (continuing)\n@Taliskye (continuing)\n@TangFeng (continuing)\n@tanman (new)\n@Lonser (new)\n\nThe process for choosing committee members was the same as previously.\nThere were open applications for all positions, then the lead positions were elected by the community. Following this, the leads interviewed reviewer applicants and decided who shall join the team as a reviewer.\n\nBudget:\nThe budget will remain the same as outlined in PTIP-14 1.\n\nThe budget for each quarter is capped at $500k with a maximum of $100k accounting for the operating budget.\n\nThe compensation will continue to be $100/hr for all roles.\n\nHours will be capped at 30 hrs/week split among the two leads and 6hrs/week per reviewer.\n\nIn the past, these caps have rarely been hit.\n\n",

      "title": "PTIP-74: Treasury Working Group Third Quarter Renewal",
      "content": "Simple Summary\nThe Treasury Working Group (TWG) was formed after PTIP-46 1 was passed. Last quarter, the TWG was funded with 12,820 POOL for our third operational quarter, plus 3,000 USDC for execution and reimbursement costs. Now that the TWG’s second operational quarter is complete, members are seeking renewal for a third quarter and a budget request of 52,314 POOL/quarter, as well as 2,000 USDC (to be converted to ETH) for PTIP and execution gas costs.\n\nIf this PTIP is approved, the TWG’s third quarter would begin on Wednesday (15 June 2022).\n\nAbstract\nThe TWG reviewed our third operational quarter performance and outlined our third quarter deliverables in the forum post below and within the TWG Notion page.\n\nPer our original proposal, the TWG’s core purpose is to:\n\nEnsure safety and prudence go into every decision\nDrive future protocol growth\nIdentify sustainable solutions\nPresent objective data to the community\nIn keeping with our core purpose, the TWG will focus on our core duties plus the following high level deliverables, which we’ve identified as top priority for our third quarter:\n\n\nMotivation\nThe TWG provides objective analysis and data for any governance proposal or forum post that discusses a potential use of treasury funds. During our second quarter, the TWG provided analysis on POL initiatives, received approval to experiment with Uni v3 on Polygon, advised on prize tiering to reduce subsidy but stay competitive, advocated for deployment on Ethereum rollup solutions (i.e., Optimism), and more. For a full review of our activity, Poolers can review the Treasury Working Group page on Notion.\n\nMembers of the TWG have played a vital role in governance discussions regarding prize tiering and simulation.\n\nFor our proposed third quarter, the TWG will focus on pressing issues for the DAO: namely, reviewing the new prize pool network on testnet, potential avenues for growth, infrastructure that can be used to create new products (via bounty), DAO expenditures, and POL analysis, recommendations. The main theme of our third quarter will be on sustainable practices, which concern DAO expenditures and growth initiatives (re: growing inflows to offset outflows).\n\nThe TWG will also expand the core duties of the working group, like those stated above. Over our first two quarters, members have provided sound analysis and recommendations on the proposed core duties–the community has been receptive to the past RFCs and PTIPs put forth by the TWG, as reflected in governance outcomes.\n\nWe’ll also work with other working groups within PoolTogether, such as the Marketing Working Group (MWG) to determine how the protocol can balance expense management with the Optimism launch campaign and the mutli-delegator contract to achieve growth in deposits.\n\nIn our third quarter, the TWG will deliver on our core purpose, while providing DAO members with the objective analysis and insight necessary to make informed decisions on treasury-related governance proposals.\n\nSpecification\nIn our second quarter, the TWG requested a budget of 12,820 POOL/quarter, with an allocation of 4,273.33 POOL per month that was distributed via Coordinape. Distributions were executed from the TWG Polgyon multisig: 0x8F8e905Cd8b7b0e435e1030BE250970Bf8c9ab8B\n\nOver the course of our second quarter, 4,273.33 POOL were distributed among active contributors each month.\n\nWhen our second budget was requested, POOL was ~$3.34/POOL. The TWG chose to be paid in POOL to align incentives with the DAO. The total quarterly budget was $30,000 USD, or $10,000/month. During our second quarter, the average contributor received $712.16 in POOL for their monthly contribution due to the change in POOL prices.\n\nFor our third operational quarter, the TWG is seeking $35,000 in POOL, which is equivalent to 52,314 POOL/quarter, or  17,438 POOL/month at the market price of $0.66/POOL. We still believe payment in POOL aligns incentives with the community and drives us to work for the betterment of the protocol. An increased allocation to our budget is intended to reduce the churn of contributors and provide incentives for at least 6 contributors, so we can expand the scope of the TWG’s analysis and core duties.\n\nIf this PTIP is approved, our third quarter would begin on Wednesday (15 June 2022).\n\nReview of, Request for Compensation Related to On-Chain Governance Gas Costs\nMembers spent a total of 0.48808710089 ETH in gas costs for submitting on-chain transaction executions and proposals on behalf of the TWG. This amount includes direct costs from the mainnet multisig and the reimbursement costs for members.\n\nOur initial funding was 3,000 USDC, which was converted to 0.87367 ETH. Currently, the TWG has 0.3856 ETH remaining in the mainnet multisig. As there are additional gas costs associated with submitting on-chain proposals and executing transactions on mainnet, we request a 2,000 budget in USDC that will be used to acquire ETH that is held in the TWG multisig on mainnet; some of this funding will go to reimbursing TWG members over the next quarter for executing transactions and submitting on-chain proposals. Any ETH that is not used for executing on-chain proposals can be returned to the treasury or rolled over at the end of the operational quarter.\n\nRead more in the governance thread: https://gov.pooltogether.com/t/ptip-74-treasury-working-group-third-quarter-renewal/2333",

By doing so we can offer prize distributions for all size Poolers and minimize the gas cost as a ratio of claimable prizes won. \n\nWith more options for Poolers we hope to see growth which will reduce treasury subsidy by generating more yield for prizes.  In addition this proposal seeks to spend less by reducing the total prize value per day. All in a push towards sustainability for the protocol\n\nThis proposal also sets the prizecap to a limit of one prize per day per Pooler.

      "content": "## PTIP-71 Extend POOL Pool Emissions \n### Simple Summary\nContinue POOL distribution to pPOOL stakers for 60 days and remove the early exit fee.\n\n### Motivation\n- Rewarding long-term aligned holders staked in the pPOOL \n- Further distributing the POOL token to protocol participants\n- Giving additional runway to work out our tokenomics\n\n### Overview\nThe POOL rewards for the V3 Ethereum POOL pool will run out in a day. Currently, the pool is emitting 200 POOL per day in the form of a POOL drip. Previously the pool has additionally been awarding a weekly prize of 200 POOL.\n\n### Rationale\nThe POOL pool is one of the few incentives POOL token holders currently have. Users in the POOL pool might not just care to vote in governance, but they might also care for incentives.\nOften the pPOOL represents half of the voting power brandished on any given vote. Per capita, the pPOOL sees 5:1 voters compared to on-chain. Continuing to reward these protocol participants and holders is crucial until we implement a new method of governance and vesting.\nWe should continue incentivizing POOL token holders to hold and vote by staking in the POOL pool. This proposal continues the POOL drip towards the POOL pool for 60 days at the current rate of 200 POOL per day (12,000 POOL total). As the weekly prize will not be continued, the proposal also removes the pool’s early exit fee.\n\n### Technical Specification\nTransfer on the POOL token `0x0cEC1A9154Ff802e7934Fc916Ed7Ca50bDE6844e` amount `12000000000000000000000` POOL to `0x30430419b86e9512E6D93Fc2b0791d98DBeb637b` pPOOL faucet\n\nSetCreditPlanOf on the POOL pool `0x396b4489da692788e327E2e4b2B0459A5Ef26791` Token: `0x27D22A7648e955E510a40bDb058333E9190d12D4` \n_creditRateMantissa (uint128): 0 \n_creditLimitMantissa (uint128): 0\n\n### Status\nPrevious Discussion: [RFC: Renewing pPOOL and POOL/ETH LP Uni V2 Rewards](https://gov.pooltogether.com/t/rfc-renewing-ppool-and-pool-eth-lp-uni-v2-rewards/2158)\n\n",

After settlement, the Ondo team will send back 307,693.06 POOL to the PoolTogether treasury (93,639 more than originally provided).\n\n## Abstract\n\nThe TWG proposes that the protocol send 350,559.66 USDC to Ondo to settle LaaS program debt OTC to avoid needing to rebalance on the market with low liquidity.\n\n## Specification\n\nIn order to receive the 307,693.06 POOL held within Ondo’s smart contracts now that the program has concluded, PoolTogether needs to settle the 350,559.66 USDC debt.\n\n### Rationale \n\nWhen PoolTogether deployed POOL into the LaaS program, 214,000 POOL was allocated to the variable-rate position. Fei Protocol provided 1,134,200 FEI in the fixed-rate position, with a hurdle of 5.13% APY to be satisfied at maturity.\n\nThe settlement terms highlight the difference in FEI + POOL at the conclusion of the program, where PoolTogether has an additional 93,693.06 POOL tokens, which are valued at $278,268.38 given today’s prices ($2.97 at time of writing). The DAO also received 67,828.55 TRIBE valued at $34,850.85 given today’s prices ($0.513808 at time of writing). Taking these amounts into account, the net cost to the protocol is roughly $37,440.43 when POOL and TRIBE is taken into consideration along with the senior position hurdle.\n\nSettling directly with Ondo will prevent further sell pressure on the POOL token, which would happen if POOL were exchanged for FEI directly on-chain.\n\nI spoke with Gabriel Bianconi from Ondo and reached an agreement on these terms. Upon execution of this PTIP, Ondo will send the 307,693.06 POOL back to the protocol treasury.",

      "content": "# PTIP-69\n\n## Simple Summary\n\nThe Treasury Working Group (TWG) proposes deploying WETH/POOL liquidity on Polygon to support the POOL token and broaden our community knowledge of Uniswap V3. \n\n## Abstract\n\nWe propose that the TWG be approved to execute the deployment of a Uniswap V3 position on Polygon for WETH/POOL.  The deployment would be maintained by the TWG for 90 days at which time it could be re-evaluated and potentially renewed.\n\n## Motivation\n\nThe majority of PT users now are on Polygon, and while over 100k POOL currently circulates on Polygon the liquidity is extremely shallow resulting in high slippage.  This proposal will add significant support to the POOL token on Polygon.  In addition we are looking to build community knowledge as we move towards a much greater cross-chain liquidity solution for the POOL token.  Lastly protocol owned liquidity will generate fees for the protocol.\n\n## Specification\n\nTransfer 25k POOL and 6525 GTC from the Treasury to the TWG Gnosis safe.  The TWG will then swap the GTC for ETH and bridge both POOL and ETH to Polygon.  The tokens will be added to WETH/POOL on Uniswap V3.\n\n\n### Rationale\n\nPrevious attempts for protocol owned liquidity with Olympus PRO and Ondo LaaS have been deemed unsuccessful and the protocol is looking for the most effective liquidity solution to support the token.  We have chosen to use half of the treasuries Gitcoin holdings because they represent the largest unutilized holding in the treasury.  WETH will be the base pair for its popular routing and to build some position for the treasury as the POOL token appreciates.\n\n### Technical Specification\n\ncontract: POOL 0x0cEC1A9154Ff802e7934Fc916Ed7Ca50bDE6844e\ntransfer 25000000000000000000000 \nto 0xB74659A1011F6DCA3BA6F6e22a71bA8f414F36A1\n\ncontract: GTC 0xDe30da39c46104798bB5aA3fe8B9e0e1F348163F\ntransfer 6525000000000000000000 \nto 0xB74659A1011F6DCA3BA6F6e22a71bA8f414F36A1\n\n\nRFC for reference: https://gov.pooltogether.com/t/rfc-protocol-deployed-liquidity-on-polygon-uniswap-v3/2145",

Having adequate prizes reserves ensures all prizes awarded can be fulfilled.\n\n## Abstract\n\nThis proposal on execution will transfer 400k in PTaUSDC to the executive-team safe on Ethereum mainnet.  The executive-team then will balance the prize liquidity reserves across chains.\n\n## Motivation\n\nRefilling the prize reserves is an accounts management activity for the treasury.  We do not keep all treasury V4 deposits in prize liquidity because it is managed by a multi-sig.  But we do need an amount sufficient to balance prize liquidity across chains efficiently and provide cushion for any possible demand scenarios.\n\n\n### Overview\n\nIt is estimated this liquidity provision will sustain us for two months with the current prize distribution or six months with the proposed prized distributions in PTIP-66.\n\n### Rationale\n\nBy analyzing the rate of prize liquidity depletion, the recent deposit metrics, and Aave yields we see that the prize reserves are depleting at around 6k USDC per day.  With the current reserves and outstanding claimable prizes we have around two weeks to zero, all things held equal.  Because of the nature of the cross-chain system, the fluctuating variables in prize liquidity demand, and the time it takes for governance to take action, we should act now to avoid any situation of depositors attempting to claim prizes that are not there to be claimed.\n\nThere will be no change in effective yield generated by the treasury deposits as prize reserves compared to sponsorship.\n\n### Technical Specification\n\nTransfer 400000000000 PTaUSDC (0xdd4d117723C257CEe402285D3aCF218E9A8236E1) from Treasury Timelock to Executive-Team Gnosis safe on Ethereum (0xDa63D70332139E6A8eCA7513f4b6E2E0Dc93b693)\n\n## Status\n\nRFC with poll showing consensus here: https://gov.pooltogether.com/t/rfc-prize-liquidity/2102",

Now that the TWG’s first operational quarter is complete, members are seeking renewal for a second quarter and a budget request of 12,820 POOL/quarter, as well as 3,000 USDC (1 ETH value) for PTIP gas costs.\n\nIf this PTIP is approved, our second quarter would retroactively begin on Monday (14 March 2022).\n\n## Abstract\n\nThe TWG reviewed our first operational quarter performance and outlined our second quarter deliverables in the (RFC) Treasury Working Group | Second Quarter Renewal forum post.\n\nPer our original proposal, the TWG’s core purpose is to:\n\n* Ensure safety and prudence go into every decision\n* Drive future protocol growth\n* Identify sustainable solutions\n* Present objective data to the community\n\nIn keeping with our core purpose, the TWG will focus on the following high level deliverables, which we’ve identified as top priority for our second quarter:\n1. Exploring protocol-owned liquidity solutions (POL)\n2. Identify new yield sources\n3. Prize tiering, simulation\n4. Non-stablecoin asset management\n5. Leveraging TWAB, Delegated Chance to Win for Growth\n\n### TWG Membership\n\nIn our second operational quarter, @BraveNewDeFi will be the proposed chair and, if approved, he will take on the TWG Chair role. He would be responsible for coordinating communication, posting feedback/comments on the forum, and maintaining close communication with the PoolTogether Inc. team to ensure both the TWG and the protocol are working toward the same goals.\n\nIn our next quarter, the following TWG members will remain as contributors:\n\n* underthesea\n* drcpu\n* TheRealTuna\n* BRONDER\n* BraveNewDeFi (Llama)\n* yuan-han-li (Llama)\n\nWe are also looking for an addition 1-2 members who would like to contribute to the TWG; total membership will likely be between 7-8.\n\n## Motivation\n\nThe TWG provides objective analysis and data for any governance proposal or forum post that discusses a potential use of treasury funds. During our first quarter, the TWG provided analysis on POL initiatives, which were shared and noticed outside of the DAO.\n\nMembers of the TWG have played a vital role in governance discussions regarding prize tiering and simulation. In our first quarter, we reviewed stablecoin asset management approaches and proposed PTIP: 54: Treasury Assets Management #1, which was passed by the DAO to add productive assets to our treasury and use USDC to generate interest for prizes in V4. For a full review of our first quarter performance, see the (RFC) Treasury Working Group | Second Quarter Renewal.\n\nFor our proposed second quarter, the TWG will focus on pressing issues for the DAO: namely, POL solutions that don’t come at a significant cost to the protocol and identifying new yield sources to increase yield and reduce the TVL benchmarks PoolTogether needs to reach in order to achieve profitability.\n\nThe TWG will also make some deliverables core duties of the working group, like prize tiering/simulation analysis and asset management. Now that stablecoin assets have been deployed into productive strategies, the TWG will turn our focus to the optimal use of non-stablecoin treasury assets.\n\nWe’ll also work with other working groups within PoolTogether, such as the Marketing Working Group (MWG) to determine how the protocol can leverage the TWAB contract and the mutli-delegator contract to achieve growth in deposits.\n\nIn our second quarter, the TWG will deliver on our core purpose, while providing DAO members with the objective analysis and insight necessary to make informed decisions on treasury-related governance proposals.\n\n## Specification\n\nFor our second operational quarter, the TWG is seeking $30,000 in POOL, which is equivalent to 12,820 POOL/quarter, or 4,273.33 POOL/month. We still believe payment in POOL aligns incentives with the community and drives us to work for the betterment of the protocol. An increased allocation to our budget is intended to reduce the churn of contributors and provide incentives for 6-8 contributors, so we can expand the scope of the TWG’s analysis and core duties.\n\nIf this PTIP is approved, our second quarter would retroactively begin on Monday (14 March 2022).\n\n### Compensation for On-Chain Governance Gas Costs\n\n@underthesea spent a total of 0.1574 ETH in gas costs for submitting on-chain proposals on behalf of the TWG. The relevant transactions are included here 1 and here. We request retroactive compensation for underthesea’s gas costs, as submitting on-chain PTIPs was not initially in the scope of the TWG. When we first formed, we were to provide analysis but have no execution power.\n\nGoing forward, the TWG will take on the responsibility for putting votes on-chain in the second operational quarter. There will be additional gas costs associated with submitting on-chain proposals, so we are requesting a 3,000 budget in USDC that will be used to acquire WETH that is held in the TWG multisig; some of this funding will go to reimbursing underthesea, as well. Any WETH that is not used for executing on-chain proposals will be returned to the treasury or rolled over at the end of the operational quarter.\n\n### TWG Gnosis Safe on Ethereum\n\nIn the TWG’s first quarter, funding was directed from the Polygon Executive multisig, which was on Polygon. Since this distribution will be on mainnet, funds will be held in a 3/5 Gnosis Safe with the following signers:\n\n* BraveNewDefi - 0x06223C0093Fc9FC872C8968BF13a15AE18f2484f\n* BRONDER - 0x3bc1158e5bcE8c10e5DA0EdFBB94b261eec46A76\n* underthesea - 0x93146d9978d286EE085ba68eE1786a0b6EDA64EC\n* drcpu - 0xC734011dBd90677eb42C0F93827665F0ddaed46F\n* TheRealTuna - 0xa31c2232842e631cCb2d2E4110B356Bab21E6020\n\nPTIP gas reimbursement and Coordinape funding will be distributed from this multisig. \n\n### Technical Specification\n\n1) Withdraw 3000000000 PTaUSDC from the prize pool\n2) Transfer 3000000000 USDC to TWG multisig\n3) Transfer 12820000000000000000000 POOL to TWG multisig\n\nTWG multisig address: 0xB74659A1011F6DCA3BA6F6e22a71bA8f414F36A1\n\n",

      "content": "## PTIP-59 EPNS Partnership & Exec Team Mandate\n\n### Simple Summary\n\nEPNS has reached out to us to integrate PoolTogether prize notifications into their App.\n\nThis proposal will:\n* confirm the Partnership with EPNS\n* appoint a mandate to manage the notification channel and it's delegates to the Executive Team\n\n### Motivation\n\nEthereum Push Notification Service (EPNS) is a decentralized protocol allowing Ethereum users to receive notifications for on-chain or off-chain activity. This integration will allow users to get a notification to their phone once they win a prize. The notification will forward users to the [PoolTogether App](https://app.pooltogether.com/prizes) to claim their prize.\n\nEverything for the integration is finished and EPNS already created promotion material and videos for the user journey.\nPolygon launch for EPNS is just around the corner, which would allow a grand majority of PoolTogether users to receive those notifications.\n\nEPNS has implied there are no costs involved for PoolTogether.\n\n\n### Specification\n\nTo turn the notification channel live it's required to set an EPNS wallet as [delegate to send notifications](https://whitepaper.epns.io/protocol-specs-section/epns-protocol/sending-notifications/delegation-of-notifications) on behalf of PoolTogether. A delegate is allowed to take care of all notification needs. The delegation is done through an on-chain transaction from the Exec Team Multi-Sig.\n\nThis proposal will:\n\n* confirm our Partnership with EPNS\n* appoint the Executive Team a broad mandate to manage our EPNS notification channel and its delegates, allowing them to do what is needed.\n\n### Status\nPrevious discussion: https://gov.pooltogether.com/t/epns-partnership-prize-notifications/2032",

      "content": "Simple Summary\nAdding @drcpu to the exec-team\nCorrection to total POOL funding\nClarifying compensation to be priced at funding\n\nMotivation\n@drcpu is a the doctor of V4 data. Originally @drcpu was on the exec-team but missed an opt-in due to time zone differences. This proposal will put him back on the team where he can help forecast prize liquidity and sign transactions on the gnosis safe.\n\nThe original funding budget for the executive-team was miscalculated. This proposal provides a solution and clarification to enable compensating the team as originally outlined.\n\nThe POOL part of the compensation budget was not specified if it should be priced at funding or at distribution. This proposal clarifies POOL will be priced at distribution.\n\nTechnical Specification\nThe exec-team will add @drcpu as a signer to the gnosis safe. He will be added to the team Discord channel as well.  Signing address: \n\nPOOL will be paid to the team priced at distribution. For example if POOL is $5 each team member will receive 40 POOL ($200). If when monthly compensation is distributed POOL is $50 then each member will receive 4 POOL ($200).\n\nThe total POOL budget from PTIP-53 should have been 5,664 POOL - the team received 3,240. The additional 2,424 POOL will come from the 2,500 POOL previously held by the poly-ops team. This POOL is already on the gnosis safe and this PTIP only adds clarity to complete the budget.\n\nPrevious discussion: https://gov.pooltogether.com/t/executive-team-clarifications-and-member-addition/2035\n\nPTIP-58 on forum: https://gov.pooltogether.com/t/ptip-58-exec-team-add-drcpu-clarify-compensation/2040",

This proposal will transfer sponsorship tokens to the executive team, who will distribute the tokens appropriately.\n\n## Abstract\n\nThis proposal will transfer $350k ScUSDC to the Executive Team.\n\n## Motivation\n\nPoolTogether is currently subsidizing prizes across all V4 prize pools.  Because liquidity is being consumed faster than interest builds, we need to explicitly transfer tickets into the Prize Distributor contracts.\n\n## Specification\n\n### Overview\n\nThis proposal will transfer ScUSDC tokens to the Executive Team.   The executive team will unwrap those tokens as needed and deposit them into V4 prize pools.  The Executive Team lead will decide how to balance the funds across prize pools and set up the transactions.\n\n### Rationale\n\nThis proposal is transferring $350k ScUSDC because that is approximately the amount of prizes given out over one month.  This proposal will give us another month of runway.\n\n\n# PTIP-53: Executive Team Budget\n\nThis proposal will fund the Executive Team for 6 months. The Executive Team will operate according to the structure outlined below.\n\n# Executive Team\n\nThe Executive Team controls key PoolTogether V4 smart contracts using Gnosis Safes that are deployed across Ethereum, Polygon, and Avalanche. The members and required confirmations for each Safe are identical.\n\n- [Executive Team Ethereum Safe](https://gnosis-safe.io/app/#/safes/0xDa63D70332139E6A8eCA7513f4b6E2E0Dc93b693/balances)\n- [Executive Team Polygon Safe](https://polygon.gnosis-safe.io/app/#/safes/0x3feE50d2888F2F7106fcdC0120295EBA3ae59245/balances)\n- [Executive Team Avalanche Safe](https://gnosis-safe.io/app/avax:0x6323A881Ea07f64dD8ec67B15fBB5dC6383eFAc6/balances)\n\n## Current Membership\n\nThe current executive team members are listed below.

This is so that we can quickly fix smart contracts and because PT governance does not currently extend to Polygon or Avalanche. The executive team **must** act in accordance with the wishes of governance. The wishes of governance can be expressed as an explicit order, or as a broader mandate.\n\n## Governance Orders\n\nGovernance can order the executive team to do anything. Practically, this will largely be adjusting prize distribution and replacing contracts.\n\nFor example: the prize distribution was changed recently in [PTIP-47: Prize Adjustments](https://gov.pooltogether.com/t/ptip-47-prize-adjustments/1752). POOL token holders signalled they wished the prize distribution to change, and the executive team followed through on the order.\n\n## Governance Mandates\n\nThe executive team has several broad mandates from governance, which include:\n\n- Distributing prize liquidity to Prize Distributor contracts\n- Taking emergency actions with the smart contracts\n\nThe executive team can be proactive here and act unilaterally to fulfill its mandate.\n\n# Executive Team Lead & Members\n\nThe executive team will appoint a lead that is in charge of ensuring orders are executed and mandates met. Team members will be required to verify and confirm transactions set up by the lead.\n\n## Team Lead\n\nThe executive team lead's current responsibilities include:\n\n- Executing explicit governance orders\n- Re-balancing prize liquidity\n- Requesting more prize liquidity with proposals to governance\n- Removing team members\n- Distributing compensation\n- Ensuring Gnosis Safe wallets are identical across all chains\n\nIf a team lead ceases to fulfill their role, then the executive team will need to appoint a new one and (possibly) remove the old one.\n\n## Team Members\n\nTeam members will do their best to verify and confirm legitimate transactions. The team lead will contact them when their signature is needed.\n\n# Managing Membership\n\nIt's very important that team members are available and actively participating, otherwise the executive team will cease to function.\n\n## Removing Members\n\nExecutive team members may decide to leave, ghost, or misbehave.\n\n- If a member wants to leave, then the lead can remove them from all Safes.\n- If a team member has not signed a transaction in two months, then the lead must remove them from all Safes. This is the **Ghost Rule**.\n- If a team member misbehaves, then it is up to the executive team how they wish to handle the situation.\n\nWhenever a member is removed from a Safe, the confirmation level is adjusted to maintain an approximately 2/3 ratio to membership.\n\n### Ghost Rule\n\nIf a member has not signed a transaction in two months, then they are removed from all Safes. The Ghost Rule should be checked once per month **before members are paid out**. When the ghost rule is activated the member does not receive compensation for that month and they are removed from the team.\n\n## Adding Members\n\nNew members of the executive team must be voted in by a governance order. This helps ensure the team doesn't become a cabal. Confirmations are adjusted to maintain an approximately 2/3 ratio to membership.\n\n# Compensation\n\nTo ensure we attract high-quality members, compensation should be robust. It should also be split between POOL tokens and stablecoins, so that the member earns ownership but also has cash to spend.\n\nThe Pool Grants committee has based their compensation on a rate of $100 / hour. We will do the same.\n\nI estimate that the team lead will need approximately 30 hours per month to fulfill their duties. Some weeks will be less, others more. Until we have better tooling, the lead will need to navigate explorers to calculate liquidity levels, view member activity to check the Ghost Rule, and potentially construct complex transactions (among other things!).\n\nTeam members will need to be available for signing, which can take several steps. In addition, they should take the time to verify the transaction validity (when possible). I would estimate they will need approximately 10 hours per month to fulfill their duties.\n\n| Role | Monthly Hours | Monthly Compensation |\n| ---- | ------------ | -------------------- |\n| Team Lead | 30 | $3000 USD |\n| Team Member | 4 | $400 USD |\n\nThe compensation will be split 50/50 between USDC and POOL, for simplicity.\n\nCompensation is paid once per month **after** the Ghost Rule is applied. The team lead sets up the payouts. This can be done efficiently using the Gnosis Safe batching mechanism.\n\n## Gas\n\nThe Team Lead will be the person that executes the Gnosis Safe transactions. These transactions can be costly, so the Team Lead should be compensated for gas in either USDC or POOL.\n\n## Communications\n\nThe Executive Team has a Discord channel, a Telegram Group, and we've privately exchanged email addresses. We have multiple lines of communication in case one goes down.\n\nWhen new members are added these channels will be updated to include them.\n\n# PTIP Specification\n\n### Overview\n\nThis PTIP will transfer POOL and ScUSDC to the Executive Team Safe on Ethereum:\n\n- 2748 POOL\n- $16,800 ScUSDC\n\n### Rationale\n\n#### Team Costs\n\nTeam members are paid $400 USD / month split 50/50 between USDC and POOL. Team lead is paid $3000 USD / month split 50/50 between USDC and POOL.\n\n| Role | Monthly Hours | Monthly Comp USDC | Monthly Comp POOL |\n| ---- | ------------ | -------------------- | --------- |\n| Team Lead | 30 | $1500 USDC | 404 POOL |\n| Team Members (10) | 4 | 10 x $200 USDC | 10 x 54 POOL |\n| | **TOTAL** | $3500 USDC | 540 POOL |\n\n#### Gas Costs\n\nFor the month of December [Exec Team gas costs were about $1100 USD](https://gnosis-safe.io/app/eth:0xDa63D70332139E6A8eCA7513f4b6E2E0Dc93b693/transactions/history).\n\n#### Totals\n\n| Description | Monthly Cost | 6 Month Cost |\n| -------------- | ------------------ | ---------------- |\n| USDC comp | $3500 USDC | $21,000 USDC |\n| POOL comp | 540 POOL | 3240 POOL |\n| Gas | $1100 USDC | $6600 USDC |\n\n**Total Ask: $27,600 USDC and 3240 POOL**\n",

Due to technical limitations, the multisig must always vote with its full voting power. E.g. if 20% of pPOOL vote yes on something, 100% of pPOOL votes will go to yes.\nMultisig signers\nAs the multisig is a point of centralization that holds large amounts of voting power, it is important that the signers are trusted. They could theoretically vote against the will of the snapshot vote if they collude to do so.\n\nThe current multisig setup is a 2-of-4 Gnosis safe, meaning 2 signers need to agree to vote.\nI propose increasing the threshold and instead making it a 3-of-6 multisig.\n\nThe multisig members would be:\n\n@Leighton (current)\n@Torgin (current)\n@nahbur (current)\n@rliriano (current)\n@AndyKaufman (new)\n@Tjark (new)\nAs this is a meta-vote with no on-chain footprint, a PTIP is not necessary.\nInstead, I suggest ratifying the voting multisig members using a Snapshot vote.\n\nThe current multisig members have been operating faithfully for over 6 months now but have never been formally chosen for the position by the community, so I think it’s good we ratify the full list officially now.\n\nDiscussion: https://gov.pooltogether.com/t/meta-vote-pool-pool-gasless-voting-setup/1898",

This extends the relationship started in [PTIP-30: Long-Term Partnership with C4](https://gov.pooltogether.com/t/ptip-30-long-term-partnership-with-c4/1388)\n\n## Motivation\n\nThe PoolTogether protocol is continually evolving.  As a result, we have a steady stream of new smart contract code.  Any code that holds user funds MUST be audited by a third party before being pushed into production.\n\nPoolTogether has been partnered with Code 423n4 for audits, and they've been doing a great job.

See [PTIP-41 Gov Post](https://gov.pooltogether.com/t/ptip-41-operations-overhaul/1664)\n\n## Abstract\n\nThis proposal will:\n\n- Cancel the existing Sablier 100k stream of ScUSDC\n- Create a new Sablier stream of ScUSDC of ~330k ScUSDC over one year\n- Do an up-front transfer of $40k ScUSDC to bootstrap the Ops budget.\n- Replace UNI and COMP RNG services with blockhash\n- Remove the gassy Loot Box integration from the USDC, DAI, UNI and COMP prize pools.\n\n## Motivation\n\nWith the rise in Ethereum gas prices, the Ethereum Operations Team does not have sufficient budget to run the prize pools.  Last week we had gas costs of ~2.23 ETH, or approximately $8600 USD.  We need much, much more in weekly budget.\n\nWe can reduce gas costs by removing some dead features and by reducing LINK costs for pools that don't need it.\n\n## Specification\n\n### Rationale\n\n- $10k / week, along with optimizations, should cover the weekly costs.  This would come from the old stream ($190k left) + new stream ($330k).\n- The loot box NFT is no longer being used, so we can strip it out entirely.  This should save ~150k gas.\n- The UNI and COMP prizes are low enough that a blockhash is sufficient for RNG.  This will save 4 LINK per week.\n",

      "content": "# PTIP-37\n\n## Simple Summary\n\nExtend POOL drip for UNI, COMP, Dai, USDC, and SUSHI Ethereum pools until the end of October. Extend prizes and drip for the POOL pool as well. \n\n\n## Motivation\n\nThe POOL drips for most Ethereum pools will be ending within the next 2 weeks ([see details here](https://info.pooltogether.com/faucets)). This proposal serves to maintain the status quo of POOL incentives on Ethereum. However, it only extends the status quo for a relatively short amount of additional time. This is because the V4 prize pool will be launching in mid October and a larger incentive overhaul will be warranted then. \n\n### Rationale\n\nThis proposal is positioned mostly as an administrative change. It is possible we could use this as an opportunity to adjust drip rates, simply let the current drips expire or make some other type of more aggressive change. I'm open to those suggestions but my personal thought is it's best to keep this simple and roll out bigger changes with the V4 launch.  \n\n### Technical Specification\n\n- Transfer POOL to the faucets for Dai, USDC, Sushi, UNI, COMP, POOL, \n- End sablier prize stream to POOL pool\n- Begin new prize stream to POOL pool \n\nNote that to combine this with PTIP-38 we're sending POOL to the eth ops team for disbursal.  1550 POOL will go to each of the UNI and COMP pools, and 1300 POOL will be swapped for PPOOL and deposited into the Sushi pool.\n\nFor the POOL Pool prizes the old Sablier prize stream will be cancelled and a new \"Prize Chunker\" contract used to stream prizes.\n\n\n# PTIP-38: Increase Ethereum Operations Team Budget\n\n## Simple Summary\n\nThe Ethereum Operations Team needs to increase its budget due to cost of mainnet transactions.\n\n## Abstract\n\nThis PTIP will add a new stream to the current Ethereum Operations Team.  The new stream will be 210k ScUSDC.\n\n## Motivation\n\nOver the last eight days 2 ETH has been consumed by the Defender relayer.  The relayer is:\n\n- Rewarding the prize pools\n- Running Pod batching\n- Claiming COMP for Compound Pools\n\nThe gas cost is about 1.75 ETH / week.  At current Ethereum prices that's about $5300 USD / week.\n\nThis number does not include LINK costs.\n\n$5300 x 52 = $275600, so we're going to ballpark the budget at $300,000.\n\n## Specification\n\n### Overview\n\nThis PTIP will:\n\n- cancel the old Sablier stream (stream id 100260)\n- create a new Sablier stream for 300k ScUSDC over one year\n",

Also adjust the COMP reserve as the COMP earned is a greater prize than the interest earned.\n\n**Specification**\nThis proposal will:\nIncrease POOL pool drip to 200 POOL per day.\n~~Add a 50 POOL per day drip to the GUSD pool~~\n~~Set the reserve rate on the GUSD pool to 10%~~\nAdd a 50 POOL per day drip to the Sushi pool\nSet the reserve rate on the sushi pool to 25%\nAdjust the reserve rate on the COMP pool to 100%\n\n**Overview**\nThese changes shall get us by until we revisit the distribution rates at the end of July.\n\n**Rationale**\nPOOL pool depositors are a very loyal group to the protocol and deserve earning a higher drip. This increase in drip can also help attract those earning POOL in the other pools to retain their POOL tokens and use them to earn more POOL instead of potentially selling them off. POOL pool APR should be in line with that of the deposit pools and the goal is also to attract more POOL pool depositors.\n\nGUSD is a new pool that we should be trying to grow and allowing depositors to earn POOL is the best path to growth. This pool also earns Aave for the protocol and that is the reasoning for not applying the standard 50% reserve that is used in the Compound pools.\n\nSushi pool sushi rewards end soon and in anticipation of continuing the pool we should set a new reserve rate and drip 50 POOL per day to maintain the pool.\n\nMost of the Compound prize comes from the Compound rewards. As discussed in the community call we should adjust the reserve rate to 100%.\n\nhttps://gov.pooltogether.com/t/ptip-25-pool-pool-boost-and-gusd-drip/1285/2#simple-summary-2",

      "title": "PTIP-24: Revised saving the little fish (phase 1)",
      "content": "## Simple Summary\n\n* Split the accrued COMP evenly across all winners.\n* Increase the number of weekly prize winners on Dai prize pool from 3 to 5 \n* Increase the number of weekly prize winners on POOL prize pool from 1 to 5 \n\n## Motivation\n\nNot enough small depositors are winning prizes. For PoolTogether to scale to the next level of growth (billions AUM / millions in weekly prizes) we have to find a way to get more people winning prizes. Especially people who have smaller deposits (10k or less). This needs to be done while keeping the protocol simple and not driving away the large depositors which create the large prizes.\n\n## Specification\n\nThis PTIP would do three things:\n\n1. Increase the number of weekly winners to the following\n  Dai Prize Pool: From 3 to 5 winners\n\n2. Instead of giving all the accrued COMP to the “grand prize” winner, split the accrued COMP among all winners equally for all prize pools (Dai, USDC, COMP, UNI)\n\n3. Increase the number of POOL pool winners from 1 to 5\n\n### Overview\n\nThis should be considered phase 1 of Operation Little Fish. This phase uses the levers immediately at the control of governance (i.e. no new solidity code written). It will meaningfully adjust the odds to favor smaller depositors by. **Phase 2 is in R&D and will expand on this same goal.**\n\nNOTE: the same wallet can win multiple prizes. So large whales will still win many of the prizes but far less of the total prizes than today.\n\n### Rationale\n\nPoolTogether is currently a victim of its own success. With over $200 million deposited, $100,000+ in weekly prizes, and prize pool reserves growing things are going better than ever. BUT, deposits into the prize pools have become increasingly dominated by large depositors. We’ve gone from the majority of prizes being won by large depositors to almost all of them being won by large whales. We need more depositors like the person [who deposited $73 and won $43,000. ](https://medium.com/pooltogether/pooltogether-myths-6d1a91d283a0) The core value proposition of PoolTogether is giving people the chance to get an outsized return on their money without risking it. Having more prizes means the odds of winning increase and this value proposition becomes stronger. PoolTogether becomes more FUN.\n\nThe change to the POOL pool to emphasize staking APR over a weekly prize also helps improve returns for POOL hodlers.\n\nThere are other methods to achieve this goal that the community has discussed. Specifically the idea of moving the POOL incentive to “sponsored” deposits that are not eligible to win. This idea has merit (I’ve been a proponent of it) but has some key limitations.\n\n* Adding a second token “drip” will increase gas costs for all users (TBD on exactly how much)\n* We will likely still have whales winning all the prizes, the whales will have the same % of total deposits but a smaller deposit in absolute numbers\n* We risk losing a lot of capital in the migration\n* We lose the benefits of having the value propo of “a chance to win + an APR” for depositors\n* The value prop of sponsorship becomes solely yield farming which is not competitive for us long term\n\nUltimately this is the simplest change to immediately and meaningfully help out small depositors. Phase 2 of the operation will expand on this same goal.\n\n### Technical Specification\n\n1. Set Dai prize pool number of winners to 5\n2. Split Dai prize pool rewards\n3. Split USDC prize pool rewards\n4. Split COMP prize pool rewards\n5. Split UNI prize pool rewards\n6. Set POOL Pool number of winners to 5\n\n## Status\n\nThis proposal was [extensively discussed and supported widely here](https://gov.pooltogether.com/t/ptip-22-operation-10x-saving-the-little-fishes-phase-1/1250).

      "content": "# PTIP-16: C4 Audit\n\nThis proposal will fund a [Code Arena](https://code423n4.com/) (C4) contest to audit the critical components of the PoolTogether codebase as well as new yield sources.\n\nThe audit is tentatively scheduled for June 16, but it's first-come first-served so it depends on how quickly we can run this PTIP.\n\n## Abstract\n\nThis proposal will transfer 72k USDC to the C4 team to fund the contest.\n\n## Motivation\n\nPoolTogether is continually evolving and expanding.  New smart contracts are being written and existing contracts are updated.  With these changes some significant risk.  Any smart contract that holds or has access to user funds is mission critical and must be scrutinized before being deployed.  Scrutiny must come from someone with deep knowledge of the relevant protocols as well as an understanding of smart contract attack surfaces.  Auditing firms specialize in this knowledge, so they are extremely valuable in de-risking smart contracts.\n\nThe core PoolTogether codebase has received third party audits from both OpenZeppelin and Diligence.  Both are great firms, and we’ve had positive experiences with them.  However, auditing firms are in short supply and lead times are now very long.  Additionally, our protocol has a steady stream of new smart contracts that need to be audited.  The classic ‘waterfall’ model of auditing the entire system in one shot no longer fits our process.  We also need an auditing firm that is willing to deal directly with protocols.\n\n## Specification\n\n### Overview\n\nThis PTIP funds the first C4 auditing contest for PoolTogether.  The scope of this contest includes several of the critical core PT contracts, as well as yield sources:\n\nCore PoolTogether contracts:\n\n- [YieldSourcePrizePool.sol](https://github.com/pooltogether/pooltogether-pool-contracts/blob/cbec82befa502500c63b59a9d0dabd678d3dd508/contracts/prize-pool/yield-source/YieldSourcePrizePool.sol)\n- [StakePrizePool.sol](https://github.com/pooltogether/pooltogether-pool-contracts/blob/cbec82befa502500c63b59a9d0dabd678d3dd508/contracts/prize-pool/stake/StakePrizePool.sol)\n- [ControlledToken.sol](https://github.com/pooltogether/pooltogether-pool-contracts/blob/cbec82befa502500c63b59a9d0dabd678d3dd508/contracts/token/ControlledToken.sol)\n- [Ticket.sol](https://github.com/pooltogether/pooltogether-pool-contracts/blob/cbec82befa502500c63b59a9d0dabd678d3dd508/contracts/token/Ticket.sol)\n\nYield sources:\n\n- [ATokenYieldSource.sol](https://github.com/pooltogether/aave-yield-source/blob/bc65c875f62235b7af55ede92231a495ba091a47/contracts/yield-source/ATokenYieldSource.sol) (Aave V2 Integration)\n- [YearnV2YieldSource.sol](https://github.com/pooltogether/pooltogether-yearnv2-yield-source/blob/a34857f1555908a6263d2ebd189f0cb40e1858da/contracts/yield-source/YearnV2YieldSource.sol) (Yearn V2 integration)\n- [SushiYieldSource.sol](https://github.com/pooltogether/pooltogether-yearnv2-yield-source/blob/a34857f1555908a6263d2ebd189f0cb40e1858da/contracts/yield-source/SushiYieldSource.sol) (SushiBar integration)\n- [IdleYieldSource.sol](https://github.com/sunnyRK/IdleYieldSource-PoolTogether/blob/6dcc419e881a4f0f205c07c58f4db87520b6046d/contracts/IdleYieldSource.sol) (Idle Finance integration)\n- Badger wBTC Yield Source (TBD)\n\nCode Arena has scoped the contest and recommends a 50-70k USD prize pot.  We’re going to put up 60k USDC for prizes, and allocate 10k of the pot to optimizations.  C4 takes 20% on top of the prizes to cover the cost of judging and administration.  That makes the total 72k USDC.\n\n### Rationale\n\n[Code Arena](https://code423n4.com/)  takes a community-driven approach to competitive smart contract audits. A contest is created for a codebase; there is a pot of funds for exploits, and another for optimizations.  Anyone can privately submit exploits to the contest and a skilled expert, the “judge”, curates the exploits into a final audit report.  The prizes are split among all who contributed to the audit report.  This has some major advantages:\n\n- Less resource-constrained\n- Builds a knowledgeable community around participating protocols\n\nTo bootstrap the C4 community’s knowledge of PoolTogether, we should start with a comprehensive up-front audit.  Once the knowledge has been seeded, we can start running more frequent flash contests; wherein a small piece of code (think: yield source) can have a short, dedicated contest.  I think this would be a great fit for our iterative process.\n\nIdeally, flash contests can be funded by the PT Grants Committee.\n\n### Technical Specification\n\nUSDC.transfer(0xC2bc2F890067C511215f9463a064221577a53E10, 72000000000)\n\n# PTIP-17\n\nDeposit the $4.5 million of USDC currently sitting in the [timelock](https://etherscan.io/address/0x42cd8312D2BCe04277dD5161832460e95b24262E) contract into the sponsorship of the USDC prize pool. For voting purposes, combine this action with PTIP-16.  \n\n## Motivation\n\nThis $4.2 million USDC was deposited into the time lock contract as part of the treasury diversification. It was suppose to be transferred in sponsorship tokens (in fact $1.15 million of it was) but due to transfer security constraints the remainder was not transferred as sponsorship. \n\nTransferring into sponsorship simply means this USDC will be contributing value to the protocol and growing larger prizes while we decide what else we may want to use it for. \n\n## Technical Specification\n\nUSDC Pool = 0xde9ec95d7708b8319ccca4b8bc92c0a3b70bf416\nUSDC = 0xa0b86991c6218b36c1d19d4a2e9eb0ce3606eb48\n\nUSCD.approve(USDC Pool, 4728000000000)\nUSDCPool.depositTo(\n  0x42cd8312D2BCe04277dD5161832460e95b24262E,\n  4728000000000,\n  0x391a437196c81eEa7BBbBd5ED4DF6b49De4F5c96,\n  0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000\n)\n\n",

      "title": "[Temp Check] Higher Reserve for Governance Prize Pools?",
      "content": "We've discussed updating the reserve contract to enable reserve rates to be set on a per pool basis (as opposed to globally).\n\nThe main idea is that a 5% reserve rate is likely too high for community pools and too low for governance pools.\n\n\"Reserve\" takes a percent of the prize and re-deposits it back into the prize pool as \"sponsorship\". Sponsorship is money that contributes interest to the prize but is NOT eligible to win.    \n\nBefore implementing the work, this temperature check is to see if people support a higher reserve rate for governance managed pools \n\nMore discussion here: https://gov.pooltogether.com/t/optimizing-reserve-rates/690",
