      "title": "MDP-159: DePrize Development",
      "content": "## Abstract\n\nThis proposal initiates the direct development of the DePrize system. The DePrize is a corner-stone of the MoonDAO Roadmap, and will serve as a general-purpose capital allocation mechanism that encourages competition to create efficiency within our organization, while balancing this with collaboration on overall goals and milestones via the governance in our organization. We have built many of the infrastructure pieces necessary for the DePrize, including the Teams infrastructure, Citizen identity primitives, reward allocation automation, and governance automation.\n\n## Problem\n\nOur current DAO structure does not encourage competition, the core problem is summarized from the Master Plan:\n\n\"First, we are moving away from a centrally-planned system of governance. Currently most DAOs, including MoonDAO, work as follows:\n\n1. A team creates a proposal.\n2. The whole DAO votes on whether to allocate funds towards that proposal.\n3. The team has a monopoly on the execution of that proposal.\n\nThis system does not work for a number of reasons:\n\n1. Low accountability for the team executing the proposal.\n2. Decision making watered down by low-context members.\n3. Unfocused system with omnidirectional efforts working in all different directions that cancel each other out.\n4. As the DAO scales, bureaucracy increases exponentially.\n5. It's incredibly slow, and anyone who wants to access funds needs to read lengthy documentation and participate in governance by constructing a proposal.\n\nThe central flaw of this model is that the who in the proposal is combined with the what of the proposal. There needs to be an abstraction layer between the two.\"\n\n## Solution\n\nThis proposal allocates a portion of effort across three core efforts:\n\n1. Start development on the DePrize\n2. Follow through with improving the Space Acceleration Network (which the DePrize leverages).\n3. Follow through with improving the automated retroactive rewards system (which the DePrize leverages).\n\nBy the end of the project, we'd like to have a functioning end-to-end prototype of the system.\n\n## Benefits\n\n* Large Improvements to the Citizen and Teams functionality and benefits.\n* DePrize demonstration completed by the end of the quarter\\\\.\n* Retroactives system fully developed and connected throughout the app \\\\+ deprize\\\\.\n\n## Risks\n\n* We don't execute effectively or on time.\n\n## Objectives\n\n**Objective #1:** Start the development for the DePrize\n\n**Key Results for Objective #1:**\n\n* Configure a revnet for the DePrize. Funding, competition, completion and phases worked out.\n* Connect the revnet to our retroactive system. The rectroactive system would dictate the auto-mint split dynamically.\n* Connect the retroactive system to the Citizens and Teams system to receive rewards for competing.\n* Creating an intuitive user interface for the prize model.\n\n**Member(s) responsible for OKR and their role:**\n\n* Jade, Pablo\n\n**Objective #2:** Follow through With Space Acceleration Network Development\n\n**Key Results for Objective #2:**\n\n* Continue promotion of the system through social channels.\n* Expand the system vertically to other chains (Mainnet, Base, Optimism, Polygon), we should meet people where they are to improve access.\n* Add email alerts and notifications throughout the app.\n* Deeper Discord integration for teams to post updates, and notifications to propagate to Discord.\n* Smart accounts for batching and gas-less transactions.\n* Connect the retroactive system to the Citizens and Teams system to receive rewards for competing.\n* Marketplace Discounts for Citizens.\n* Onboarding Dashboard with stages (Citizen, Get MOONEY, Lock MOONEY). At a glance new jobs, marketplace offerings, teams they're part of.\n* Network Map with the location of each of the Citizens.\n* Adding LinkedIn and other social links to the profiles.\n* Integrating badging and credentials for Citizens.\n* Improve the profile editing experience.\n* Expiration for Marketplace and Hiring board listings.\n* Improve links for Teams and Citizens.\n* Deeper integration into the community circle for Citizens to submit contributions.\n\n**Member(s) responsible for OKR and their role:**\n\n* Colin, Ryan\n\n**Objective #3:** Improve the Retroactive Rewards System\n\n**Key Results for Objective #3:**\n\n* Create a \"Claim\" button for individuals to claim their rewards.\n* Allow people to submit their final reports directly into the system.\n* Create an automation so that when a project passes it auto-populates in the projects table.\n* Deeply integrate the Citizens into the Community Circle retroactives (Citizens can easily submit to the Community Circle).\n* Better UI for the community circle and reward distributions.\n\n**Member(s) responsible for OKR and their role:**\n\n* Jade, Mitchie\n\n## Deadline\n\nQ4 2024\n\n```nance-actions\n--- nance-actions\n- type: Request Budget\n  payload:\n    projectTeam:\n      - discordUserId: \"933784170294026291\"\n        discordUsername: jade\n        payoutAddress: \"0x08B3e694caA2F1fcF8eF71095CED1326f3454B89\"\n        votingAddress: \"0x08B3e694caA2F1fcF8eF71095CED1326f3454B89\"\n        isRocketeer: false\n      - discordUserId: \"494739213137346561\"\n        discordUsername: pmoncada\n        payoutAddress: \"0x679d87D8640e66778c3419D164998E720D7495f6\"\n        votingAddress: \"0x679d87D8640e66778c3419D164998E720D7495f6\"\n        isRocketeer: true\n      - discordUserId: \"926244811177066558\"\n        payoutAddress: \"0xb1d4c1B9c8DA3191Fdb515Fa7AdeC3D41D014F4f\"\n        votingAddress: \"0xb1d4c1B9c8DA3191Fdb515Fa7AdeC3D41D014F4f\"\n        isRocketeer: false\n        discordUsername: Mitchie\n      - discordUserId: \"760130086048366663\"\n        payoutAddress: \"0x80581C6e88Ce00095F85cdf24bB760f16d6eC0D6\"\n        votingAddress: \"0x80581C6e88Ce00095F85cdf24bB760f16d6eC0D6\"\n        isRocketeer: false\n        discordUsername: name.get\n      - discordUserId: \"842541430186573894\"\n        payoutAddress: \"0xB2d3900807094D4Fe47405871B0C8AdB58E10D42\"\n        votingAddress: \"0xB2d3900807094D4Fe47405871B0C8AdB58E10D42\"\n        isRocketeer: false\n        discordUsername: ryand2d\n    multisigTeam:\n      - discordUserId: \"842541430186573894\"\n        discordUsername: ryand2d\n        address: \"0xB2d3900807094D4Fe47405871B0C8AdB58E10D42\"\n      - discordUserId: \"926244811177066558\"\n        discordUsername: Mitchie\n        address: \"0xb1d4c1B9c8DA3191Fdb515Fa7AdeC3D41D014F4f\"\n      - discordUserId: \"760130086048366663\"\n        discordUsername: name.get\n        address: \"0x80581C6e88Ce00095F85cdf24bB760f16d6eC0D6\"\n      - discordUserId: \"494739213137346561\"\n        discordUsername: pmoncada\n        address: \"0x679d87D8640e66778c3419D164998E720D7495f6\"\n      - discordUserId: \"933784170294026291\"\n        discordUsername: jade\n        address: \"0x08B3e694caA2F1fcF8eF71095CED1326f3454B89\"\n    budget:\n      - token: ETH\n        amount: \"7.5\"\n        justification: Jade\n      - token: ETH\n        amount: \"3.5\"\n        justification: pmoncada\n      - token: ETH\n        amount: \"3.5\"\n        justification: ryand2d\n      - token: ETH\n        amount: \"4.5\"\n        justification: name.get\n      - token: ETH\n        amount: \"3.5\"\n        justification: mitchie\n      - token: ETH\n        amount: \"1\"\n        justification: flex\n\n```",

      "content": "## Abstract\n\nA new version of the Juicebox protocol, featuring L2 support, is being deployed in the coming months and the team is performing security audits. This new protocol will have Arbitrum support and will be very useful for Space Acceleration Network (SAN) integration and DePrize. **MoonDAO should contribute 5 ETH to this audit in order to help ensure the security of the protocol.**\n\n## Problem\n\nJuicebox is the platform MoonDAO used to fund its inaugural mission ([https://juicebox.money/success-stories/moondao](https://juicebox.money/success-stories/moondao)), raising over 2,600 ETH. JuiceboxDAO is launching Version 4 (V4) of the protocol which features Arbitrum (and other L2) support with cross chain token insurance.\nJuicebox V4 will have many uses for SAN integration and has major potential to unify MOONEY issuance across chains as well. As with all new protocols, there can be security flaws. Two audits have already been perform on the protocol and the team has one more auditor lined up before deployment.\nFor more peripheral info about Juicebox V4, see the following blog posts:\n\n* Intro to Juicebox V4: [https://jango.eth.sucks/?id=E777B152-176F-4348-A627-64919E4C98C2](https://jango.eth.sucks/?id=E777B152-176F-4348-A627-64919E4C98C2)\n* Bannyverse ($BANNY), Bananapus ($NANA), Revnets, and Juicebox V4: [https://jango.eth.sucks/55CC1D61-7FCA-48B0-8083-AF7E361FD932](https://jango.eth.sucks/55CC1D61-7FCA-48B0-8083-AF7E361FD932)/\n* TLDR: Juicebox Ecosystem's Revenue-Capturing Tokens: [https://jango.eth.sucks/D64BFA1B-22A3-4B72-A3FE-EB051073F890](https://jango.eth.sucks/D64BFA1B-22A3-4B72-A3FE-EB051073F890)/\n* In on Juicebox V4: [https://jango.eth.sucks/703DEF83-5E38-4294-8D68-196F8AE4F686](https://jango.eth.sucks/703DEF83-5E38-4294-8D68-196F8AE4F686)/\n\n## Solution\n\nIn order to ensure the security of funds that will be put into the protocol in the future, MoonDAO should contribute 5 ETH to the audit fund: [https://juicebox.money/v2/p/742](https://juicebox.money/v2/p/742)\n\n## Benefits\n\nThe audit funding goal is $30k.

      "title": "MDP-156: Eiman’s Journey: Inspiring the Next Generation through Space and Social Change",
      "content": "## Abstract\n\nThis proposal aims to produce a five-part educational series with Jerome Moore of Explore Social Change, following Dr. Eiman Jahangir, the first Iranian American man to go to space, as he visits five Metro Nashville Public Schools. The series will document Eiman's journey to space, highlighting his background as a physician, astronaut, and advocate for social change. The series is designed to inspire students, especially those from underrepresented communities, to pursue STEM careers while emphasizing the importance of diversity and inclusion in science and space exploration.\n\n## Problem\n\nThere is a lack of representation in STEM fields, especially for students from underrepresented backgrounds. Many students don’t see people who look like them in science or space careers, which can make pursuing those fields seem unattainable.\n\n## Solution\n\nThis production will showcase Eiman’s journey, focusing on how he overcame barriers to reach space. By visiting schools in his hometown, Nashville, Eiman will engage directly with students, sharing his story and demonstrating that success in STEM is possible for anyone. The series will feature interviews, behind-the-scenes footage, and his personal reflections on social change, aiming to inspire and motivate students. Alternative solutions like standard presentations were considered but lack the lasting impact of a professionally produced series. Future directions could include expanding the series to other cities and regions.\n\n## Benefits\n\nThe series will benefit MoonDAO by:\n\n1. Promoting Diversity and Inclusion: Showcasing how individuals from diverse backgrounds can break barriers in space exploration.\n2. Inspiring Future STEM Leaders: By connecting with students, this series could lead to greater interest in space and science, creating future MoonDAO participants or supporters.\n3. Educational Content for Distribution: MoonDAO can use this content across platforms for outreach, brand awareness, and to attract educational partners.\n4. Revenue Generation: Potential sponsorship from educational institutions, grants, or partnerships with platforms like PBS, Netflix, or streaming services could generate revenue. Estimated revenue could range from $50,000 to $100,000 through licensing and partnerships.\n\n## Risks\n\n1. Logistical Risks: Scheduling conflicts with school visits or production delays could slow down the project. We will mitigate this by securing dates and confirming availability well in advance.\n2. Content Risks: If the content doesn’t resonate with students or fails to inspire the audience, the series may not achieve its objectives.

Simplicity is important for new members that would like to contribute and participate in MoonDAO without needing to read several pages of documentation. These changes would go into effect over the next quarter as we build better UIs for Citizens to vote and delegate in our incentives space, and go fully into effect for Q4 2024.\n\n## Problem\n\nThis proposal makes several changes to the project system, including:\n\n* Delegates are no longer a thing.\n* Citizens allocate to projects, not Senate members. This is a big change, but an important one.\n* Revenue Distribution section is removed, projects that want to do a revenue distribution deal can specify it in the proposal.\n* Same with IP, default to open source but if the project wants to do something different it can.\n* FAQs factored out, same with calculation\n* 5% incentives penalty for project leads missing senate meetings\n* 5% incentives penalty for projects leads if their project contributors are not posting updates in the progress channel.\n* Rocketeer changed to Project Lead\n* Moonsettler changed to Project Contributor\n\n## Solution\n\nPlease see the full changes implemented here:\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1RCuf4vtk1l4A1tJqbSrvxaCjJMk1MERN_z18JQiNvm8/edit\n\nYou can see the difference between Projects v5 and v6 here (must be signed in to see suggested edits):\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1tRBfDqT6MJSSWxN-FVvACUQfR_jmle4cJCzjcVImC-w/edit\n\n## Benefits\n\nSimplicity is the ultimate sophistication.\n\n## Risks\n\nChanging from Citizens distributing rewards versus Senate members may be bumpy at first, but will put power into the hands of many more people when it comes to directing MoonDAO and its incentives.\n\n## Objectives\n\n**Objective #1:** Change the Project requirements for Q4 in advance of building more robust automations and user interfaces for incentives.\n**Key Results for Objective #1:**\n\n* Pass the new changes, and update our documentation.\n\n**Member(s) responsible for OKR and their role:**\n\n* *pmoncada*",

      "title": "MDP-153: New Worlds 2024 sponsorship 11/1-11/2/2024 Houston, Texas",
      "content": "## **Abstract**\n\n***This is a high-level description of the idea. Please use ELI5 (explain like I’m five years old) wording and summarize things for anyone to understand what you want to achieve.***\n***T*he Earthlight Foundation (“EarthLight”) is asking the MoonDAO community to sponsor the New Worlds conference and Space Cowboy Ball at Space Center Houston (Houston, Texas) on 1-2 November 2024. This $20,000 “Spice” sponsorship level will:**\n\n* **demonstrate MoonDAO's commitment to space exploration and engagement with the space community;**\n* **give MoonDAO a forum to help EarthLight shape “space culture” as a thought leader and expand public support of space development; and**\n* **offer unparalleled visibility and networking opportunities with industry leaders and enthusiasts to grow the MoonDAO community.**\n\n## **Problem**\n\n***Describe the problem your proposal solves.***\n**Earthlight is increasing awareness and engagement within the space exploration/development community leading to permanent human communities in space. We need strong partners like MoonDAO who will enhance our efforts by combining their own resources and efforts with ours.**\n**Currently, we are working to secure sufficient financial support to maximize the impact of a two-part event:**\n\n* **the 2024 New Worlds (“NW”) conference, where we share diverse views and ideas about science, technology, philosophy, art, law, and all realms of human experience as they might manifest in space-based communities; and**\n* **the Space Cowboy Ball (“SCB”), a fundraising event and awards gala to support our DreamScopes project and honor the people creating “space culture”.  (Past awardees include Jeff Bezos, Gwynne Shotwell, and Jared Isaacman.)**\n\n**As a non-profit organization, we rely on support or donations from like-minded individuals and organizations.**\n\n## **Solution**\n\n***Describe the “meat & potatoes” of the proposal. Go into necessary detail about the work that needs to be done, alternative solutions considered, open questions, and future directions. Keep it concise.***\n**MoonDAO's monetary sponsorship of the NW/SCB event will ensure a significant presence at a leading space exploration event at Space Center Houston November 1 and 2, 2024. This includes branding opportunities, speaking slots, and networking engagements. MoonDAO will have an exclusive speaking slot and a workshop to showcase its mission and projects, engage with attendees throughout the event, and distribute promotional materials.**\n**While other sponsorships are being considered, EarthLight wants to continue solidifying its relationship with MoonDAO.  MoonDAO's unique mission and community make it an ideal partner for this event and EarthLight’s other projects and future goals. It is our expectation that MoonDAO’s support for the event is of mutual benefit to both the EarthLight Foundation and MoonDAO.**\n\n## **Benefits**\n\n***Point out the core benefits of the proposal implementation and how it will affect MoonDAO. If the proposal can create revenue please create justification for how much revenue it could generate.***\n**Increased Visibility: MoonDAO will be prominently featured throughout the conference as a sponsor, raising awareness of its mission among a targeted audience.We will include PR and social media education moments that highlight MoonDAO and how to be involved.**\n**Community Engagement: Direct interaction with space enthusiasts and professionals will help grow MoonDAO's community. Activations that increase engagement with New Worlds guests including ticket campaigns that include Citizen memberships and other opportunities to engage with MoonDAO.**\n**Networking Opportunities: Establishing connections with industry leaders and potential collaborators.Direct introductions and relationship cultivation with targeted groups and individuals in attendance at New Worlds and Space Cowboy Ball. Strategic relationship building that provides awareness of MoonDAO and potential adoption of the platform.**\n**Revenue Potential: Increased membership and potential partnerships can generate revenue as both citizens and entities. By providing individuals and groups the opportunity to get an online profile and some strategic education and engagement opportunities, we can work together with MoonDAO to increase its membership and recurring revenue.**\n**Activation Opportunities include:**\n\n* **Afternoon Hackathon the day prior to New Worlds (31 October 2024), using a current MoonDAO data set. Winner gets recognition during New Worlds as well as a team membership and $XX Mooney in your wallet.**\n    * **Registration fee for Hackathon: must be a Citizen of MoonDAO and have your profile complete.**\n* **Ticket Sales incentives in partnership with MoonDAO to New Worlds and the Space Cowboy Ball.**\n* **Booth/Table with demonstration and registration opportunities for MoonDAO.**\n\n**Specific benefits of the Spice level sponsorship include:**\n\n* **\"Sponsored By\" listing on all materials (printed and digital, pre-, during, and post-event)**\n* **Assistance with curated flight and hotel recommendations and exclusive discounted rates for MoonDAO attendees**\n* **Strategic marketing activations to enhance visibility and adoption of the MoonDAO platform**\n* **Admittance for up to 4 guests to the Thursday 31 VIP Reception (max 4 guests)**\n\n**New Worlds Conference**\n\n* **Six (6) New Worlds conference passes**\n* **Video or logo featured in on-screen rotation during the conference**\n* **Table/booth or activation opportunity in event entrance**\n* **Level 2 placement of logo/hyperlink on the event website**\n* **Promotional items in gift bag**\n\n**Space Cowboy Ball**\n\n* **VIP seating for six (6) including VIP hosted bar/reception**\n* **“Shout Out” acknowledgement during the awards ceremony**\n* **Activation opportunity in event entrance**\n* **Original collectible Thorpe Rocket Painting Tier 2 ($2,500 value limited edition artwork)**\n\n## **Risks**\n\n***Highlight any risks from implementing the proposal, how could this go wrong? How are you addressing those risks?***\n**Return on Investment: There is no guarantee of immediate revenue to MoonDAO.  This investment of MoonDAO’s resources supports long-term engagement by growing awareness and creating relationships that will foster MoonDAO’s own growth.**\n**Resource Allocation: MoonDAO will need to ensure that the organization has the necessary resources (staff, materials) to make the most of this opportunity.

Although there is a five signature approval threshold for execution of transactions, having too much influence from the Executive Branch on the Treasury could concentrate power too much in our community. I would warn the community to not add many more members from the Executive Branch on the Treasury to ensure a separation of powers between the operations team and the treasury.",

Ensure that the data is visually engaging, easy to interpret, and provides actionable insights. Include summary statistics, trend analysis, and performance indicators to give users a comprehensive overview of the key metrics that matter most.\n\n## Problem\n\nThe analytics page could use more metrics from on-chain analytics and final reports.\n\n## Solution\n\nBuild on top of the existing analytics page, add metrics, including key figures from quarterly final reports, and revive governance power tracking dashboard.\n\n<br>\n**Metrics:**\n\n1. Total Voting Power across all chains (Ethereum, Polygon and Arbitrum)\n2. Governance power over time (chart)\n3. Current projects & funding\n4.

      "title": "MDP-148: Citizens and Teams Q3",
      "content": "## Abstract\n\nThis project is a continuation of the work that was done on Citizens and Teams in Q1 and Q2 of 2024. Citizens and Teams are the foundation of the DAO network we're building, coordinated by our governance and incentives. This proposal is another step on our [roadmap](https://docs.moondao.com/About/Roadmap) towards scaling MoonDAO, polishing the work we've done so far on Citizens and Teams and supporting the follow-through with bringing the ten wonderful companies, nonprofits, and startups that are seeding this network alongside the individuals we've invited to be our first MoonDAO Citizens. Beyond follow-through, this project will also hire one more developer, and set the foundation for the implementation of the first DePrize that will heavily use the Teams framework.\n\n## Problem\n\nMoonDAO requires a business model to sustain itself long-term. Citizens and Teams are a core service for MoonDAO to create a steady and recurring revenue stream to grow our treasury. Offered as a subscription service for individuals and teams, it connects people to a network where they can get their projects funded by the MoonDAO community, buy and sell things on the MoonDAO marketplace (where MoonDAO takes a 1% fee), and can hire (or get hired) from the MoonDAO community.\n\nFurthermore, it improves the on-boarding experience within MoonDAO drastically, getting more people in the door and reinforce the network effects to make MoonDAO the #1 place in the world for an entrepreneur, dreamer, or enthusiast to get started on their journey to support a lunar economy. Lastly, it sets us up for the flagship DePrize that will be built on the foundation of Citizens and Teams.\n\nWe have done a lot of work to build a network of 10 organizations to seed the MoonDAO network with many citizens that are onboarding our private beta on a rolling basis. This project funds the continued development of the project to support those individuals as they onboard, fix bugs quickly, and follow-through with some much needed features to continue improving the system.\n\n## Solution\n\nSome high-level plans that we mean to integrate by the end of the quarter are:\n\n* **Better Payments:** Integrating a new payment method that allows someone to \"check-out\" with a credit card. Our current solution requires creating an account on MoonPay, a process that is cumbersome and not open to most people around the world. Instead, we'd like the process to look like buying anything else online, even if you've never had a wallet before.\n* **Public Application Launch:** Allow people to \"apply\" for someone to join our private beta for Citizens and Teams. We're rolling this out on an \"invite-only\" basis right now, but we'd like to have this live on the main MoonDAO website for people to demonstrate interest and start thoughtfully adding more individuals into the network.\n* **Marketplace Features:** Adding more functionality to the marketplace to allow anyone to browse multiple listings, and improve the marketplace to be easily compatible with existing sales channels like Shopify.\n* **Expand the Team:** Part of this project will be hiring and training a new smart contract developer to help long-term at MoonDAO.\n* **White-Glove Onboarding:** We want to focus on the end-user and have them drive development by being as close to them as possible as they're using the system. We want to be with them from beginning to end, listen to their pain-points and continuously solve the problems they're facing in real-time. Fixing bugs in hours v.s. days.\n* **DePrize:** Formalize the plan for the DePrize framework and set the stage for the flagship DePrize built on the Teams framework.\n* **Polish and Bug Fixing:** This project will also fund the countless \"unknown-unknowns\" that we will encounter as we continue development and fixing things day-to-day. Within scope of this project will also be to continue improving the MoonDAO App, especially the governance features and making sure those work nicely with the Citizens and Teams framework.\n* **Deeper Nance Integration:** This proposal will also focus on improving the nance automations and make them seamless to use from the Citizen and Team user interface.\n\n## Benefits\n\n* Stable, recurring revenue for the DAO.\n* Better onboarding for individual Citizens, with a better UI to interact with the DAO.\n* Better onboarding for companies, using the Teams system UI to interact with the DAO.\n* Creates a foundation for the DePrize, a cornerstone of our roadmap.\n* Better integration of Citizens and Teams with the Nance governance automation.\n\n## Risks\n\nAs with any proposal, there are risks of timelines getting extended, and work not being implemented as written here. The team on this proposal consists of people that have successfully implemented multiple proposals at MoonDAO.\n\n## Objectives\n\n**Objective #1:** Improve the Citizen and Teams system based on feedback from the beta users.\n**Key Results for Objective #1:**\n\n* Improve the payments system so someone can become a Citizen or Team with a credit card, with no account creation required.\n* Improve the marketplace to integrate directly with existing sales channels and create a unified UI where all marketplace listings can be viewed.\n* White-Glove Onboarding of each of the teams, listening closely to their pain-points and fixing bugs within 24 hours.\n* Deeper Nance integration and polish of our governance systems.\n* Polish and bug fixing on a daily basis, constantly iterating and improving on the current system.\n\n**Member(s) responsible for OKR and their role:**\n\n* *pmoncada, ryand2d, name.get, mitchie*\n\n**Objective #2:** Launch the Citizen and Teams system publicly with an application.\n**Key Results for Objective #1:**\n\n* Create an application form for new Companies and Citizens to apply for admission into the system.\n* Make a launch announcement of our work.\n* Create documentation for the system and a write-up of how everything works.\n\n**Member(s) responsible for OKR and their role:**\n\n* *pmoncada, ryand2d*\n\n**Objective #3:** Create the foundation for the DePrize.\n**Key Results for Objective #1:**\n\n* Hire a new full-time smart-contract developer to support future plans.\n* Formalize the development plan for the DePrize system.\n\n**Member(s) responsible for OKR and their role:**\n\n* *pmoncada, name.get*\n\n```nance-actions\n--- nance-actions\n- type: Request Budget\n  payload:\n    projectTeam:\n      - discordUserId: \"494739213137346561\"\n        discordUsername: pmoncada\n        payoutAddress: \"0x679d87D8640e66778c3419D164998E720D7495f6\"\n        votingAddress: \"0x679d87D8640e66778c3419D164998E720D7495f6\"\n        isRocketeer: true\n      - discordUserId: \"842541430186573894\"\n        discordUsername: ryand2d\n        payoutAddress: \"0x78176eaabcb3255e898079dc67428e15149cdc99\"\n        votingAddress: \"0xB2d3900807094D4Fe47405871B0C8AdB58E10D42\"\n        isRocketeer: false\n      - discordUserId: \"760130086048366663\"\n        payoutAddress: \"0x80581C6e88Ce00095F85cdf24bB760f16d6eC0D6\"\n        votingAddress: \"0x80581C6e88Ce00095F85cdf24bB760f16d6eC0D6\"\n        isRocketeer: false\n        discordUsername: name.get\n      - discordUserId: \"926244811177066558\"\n        payoutAddress: \"0xb1d4c1B9c8DA3191Fdb515Fa7AdeC3D41D014F4f\"\n        votingAddress: \"0x9fDf876a50EA8f95017dCFC7709356887025B5BB\"\n        isRocketeer: false\n        discordUsername: Mitchie\n    multisigTeam:\n      - discordUserId: \"926244811177066558\"\n        discordUsername: Mitchie\n        address: \"0xb1d4c1B9c8DA3191Fdb515Fa7AdeC3D41D014F4f\"\n      - discordUserId: \"760130086048366663\"\n        discordUsername: name.get\n        address: \"0x80581C6e88Ce00095F85cdf24bB760f16d6eC0D6\"\n      - discordUserId: \"842541430186573894\"\n        discordUsername: ryand2d\n        address: \"0x78176eaabcb3255e898079dc67428e15149cdc99\"\n      - discordUserId: \"494739213137346561\"\n        discordUsername: pmoncada\n        address: \"0x679d87D8640e66778c3419D164998E720D7495f6\"\n      - discordUserId: \"327806187955290112\"\n        discordUsername: Larrotiz\n        address: \"0x5640Ddc028f2436B5C0BA0305D2199556C1b5a95\"\n    budget:\n      - token: \"0xdAC17F958D2ee523a2206206994597C13D831ec7\"\n        amount: \"6000\"\n        justification: Developer ($3k/month x 2 months)\n      - token: \"0xdAC17F958D2ee523a2206206994597C13D831ec7\"\n        amount: \"6000\"\n        justification: Designer ($3k/month x 2 months)\n      - token: \"0xdAC17F958D2ee523a2206206994597C13D831ec7\"\n        amount: \"6000\"\n        justification: Sales ($3k/month x 2 months)\n      - token: \"0xdAC17F958D2ee523a2206206994597C13D831ec7\"\n        amount: \"6000\"\n        justification: TPM ($3k/month x 2 months)\n      - token: \"0xdAC17F958D2ee523a2206206994597C13D831ec7\"\n        amount: \"5000\"\n        justification: Flex budget (Primarily for legal)\n```\n\n## Proposed Actions\n\n\n**[BUDGET REQUEST]**\n29,000 0xdAC17F958D2ee523a2206206994597C13D831ec7\n\n**[TEAM MEMBERS]**\n* <@494739213137346561>\n* <@842541430186573894>\n* <@760130086048366663>\n* <@926244811177066558>\n\n*actions appended to proposal body by [Nance](https://nance.app/s/moondao)*",

      "title": "MDP-147: Change Election Process to Ranked Choice Voting",
      "content": "## Abstract\n\nIn the current MoonDAO Executive Branch Leader election process we simply use weighted voting with a super-majority. This proposal includes new language for the MoonDAO Constitution to use Instant Runoff Rank Choice Voting.\n\n## Problem\n\nIf there are more than two candidates running for election, \"first-pass-the-poll\" voting creates a game theory issue where third-party candidates are at a huge disadvantage. Using ranked choice voting you can signal your true preference without compromising or worrying about \"throwing away your vote\" on a third-party candidate.\n\n<br>\n## Solution\n\nAn in-depth explanation of Instant Runoff Ranked Choice Voting can be found here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instant-runoff\\_voting\n\nThe current MoonDAO Constitution reads as follows for the Executive Branch Leader Election:\n\n> Election\n> \n> MoonDAO members may hold an election for a new Astronaut if there is a vacancy. Candidate Astronauts may be nominated by MoonDAO members and must have been part of the Senate for at least 180 days. Each nomination must go through the senate with a super majority vote. If there are multiple nominations that go through the Senate, then the DAO will vote among the candidates using $vMOONEY with weighted voting. There may be multiple rounds of voting until a Candidate Astronaut receives super-majority votes to be confirmed as an Astronaut.\n\nThis will be changed as follows, additions have been bolded, and the removed portion strikethroughed.\n\n> Election\n> \n> MoonDAO members may hold an election for a new Astronaut if there is a vacancy. Candidate Astronauts may be nominated by MoonDAO members and must have been part of the Senate for at least 180 days. Each nomination must go through the senate with a super majority vote. If there are multiple nominations that go through the Senate, then the DAO will vote among the candidates using $vMOONEY with ~~weighted voting~~ **Instant Runoff Ranked Choice Voting**. ~~There may be multiple rounds of voting until a Candidate Astronaut receives super-majority votes to be confirmed as an Astronaut.~~\n\n\n## Benefits\n\nThis avoids MoonDAO from game-theoretically landing on a \"two-party\" system with two major candidates.\n\nSome benefits from Wikipedia are quoted below:\n\n> Instant-runoff voting has notably high resistance to tactical voting when it elects the Condorcet winner. Proponents of IRV claim that IRV eliminates the spoiler effect, since IRV makes it safe to vote honestly for marginal parties: Under a plurality method, voters who sympathize most strongly with a marginal candidate are strongly encouraged to instead vote for a more popular candidate who shares some of the same principles, since that candidate has a much greater chance of being elected and a vote for the marginal candidate will not result in the marginal candidate's election. An IRV method reduces this problem, since the voter can rank the marginal candidate first and the mainstream candidate second; in the likely event that the fringe candidate is eliminated, the vote is not wasted but is transferred to the second preference.\n\n## Risks\n\nRisks of Instant Runoff Ranked Choice voting from Wikipedia:\n\n> It does not ensure the election of a Condorcet winner, which is the candidate who would win a direct election against any other candidate in the race. IRV does not demonstrate resistance to tactical voting when it does not elect the Condorcet winner. Some critics of IRV have noted that because of its greater complexity, IRV can create distrust among voters who misunderstand it. Often such criticism is related to allegations that IRV is a kind of plural voting. In Ann Arbor, arguments over IRV in letters to newspapers included the belief that IRV \"gives minority candidate voters two votes\", because some voters' ballots may count for their first choice in the first round and a lesser choice in a later round. The argument that IRV represents plural voting is sometimes used in arguments over the \"fairness\" of the method, and has led to frequent legal challenges in the United States.\n\n\n<br>\n## Objectives\n\n**Objective #1:** Amend the Constitution to use Instant Runoff Ranked Choice Voting.\n\n**Key Results for Objective #1:**\n\n* Change the Constitution and apply this to the upcoming election in August.\n\n**Member(s) responsible for OKR and their role:**\n\n* *pmoncada*",

      "title": "MDP-145: 2nd Astronaut Support Q3",
      "content": "## **Abstract**\n\nThis proposal aims to continue and build upon advances made in Q2 with a support team surrounding Dr. Eiman Jahangir's forthcoming launch as a representative of MoonDAO. This team will perform outreach for publicity and coverage via various media platforms, including podcasts, articles, and videos, to get the word out about the launch, Eiman, and MoonDAO, increase community involvement, and plan/orchestrate on the ground activities for the launch, including things like in-person event, coverage,medical research, etc.\n\nWhile the launch date is still unknown and TBD, this proposal includes funding for on the ground activities, including travel stipends for MoonDAO members to attend the launch, payment to Eiman as a payload specialist, funds for merchandise printing as swag, and so forth. Any funds will be retained by the project until the project wraps after a successful launch. This means that unused funds will not be returned to the treasury at the end of the quarter until after launch, regardless of timing.\n\n**[See Q2 Final Report](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nncQa_f0X8M6euMpFmudFrPifHOuo6-3l1ANgzJHBAE/edit?usp=sharing)**\n\n## **Problem**\n\nRaising awareness regarding Dr. Eiman’s launch with MoonDAO. Ensuring that we establish strategies for engaging the wider space community in this launch. Ensuring that we have funding available to conduct on the ground activities and fulfillment of other deliverables should a launch date be announced.\n\n## **Solution**\n\nWe’ll assemble a team tasked with executing a multifaceted publicity campaign. This team will be responsible for doing outreach for coverage on podcasts, articles, videos, and other outlets. Concurrently, efforts will be directed towards devising innovative means of involving the MoonDAO community in Eiman’s mission, such as deciding what sorts of contributions we’ll include in his payload and organizing on-the-ground events to coincide with the launch.\n\n## **Benefits**\n\nImplementation of the proposal promises several key benefits. Primarily, it will amplify awareness of Eiman’s mission and bolster MoonDAO's visibility within the broader space community. Moreover, by fostering community engagement, the initiative aims to cultivate a sense of shared ownership and investment among MoonDAO community members, leading to increased engagement and excitement in the long term.\n\n## **Risks**\n\nPotential risks associated with the proposal include the possibility of inadequate outreach or limited community participation. This project will continue laying the groundwork but there is no certainty about launch timing or date..\n\n## **Objectives**\n\n**Objective #1:** Publicity and Coverage for Eiman's Forthcoming Launch\n\n**Key Results for Objective #1:**\n\n* Secure additional coverage on at least 5 podcasts, 3 articles in print or online publications, and 2 video interviews during Q3.\n* Reach a cumulative audience of at least 100,000 individuals across all media platforms by the end of the quarter.\n* In the event of a launch, outreach will be made to outlets where Eiman was previously a guest to share his post-launch story.\n\n**Objective #2:** Plan MoonDAO Community Engagement and Participation\n\n**Key Results for Objective #2:**\n\n* Initial planning for an on-the-ground event surrounding the launch (date TBD), with attendance from MoonDAO members, as well as I24 and the wider space community. MoonDAO members (vMOONEY holders and/or Citizens) would be eligible to receive a $1,500 stipend to join the event in Texas. We also have another $10k for incidental expenses for the group, including things like dinner, happy hour, transport, and other hosted elements.\n    * Order of priority for potential attendees is a total vMooney amount.\n* Off site launch watch- Interstate-54 is open but monitored. Guests can drive North of the gate from Van Horn proper; pass the launch site 1 on the right. Continue on that road for a couple of miles and get closer to the actual launch site. Don’t go too far. Get settled at least an hour prior to the site. Approximately 7 AM at latest. Possibly set up a car pool from Van Horn to off site launch viewing. We are thinking people would take a bus from El Paso to the off site launch viewing area.\n* Order 400 patches and 1000 stickers total  - rough estimate is $700 for patches and  $370 for stickers = $1100\n* Print 100 patches to fly to space and provide as member prizes or swag in the future.\n* Print 1000 stickers for Eiman Jahangir personal use.\n* Print 30 MoonDAO shirts (mission patch on the back and MoonDAO on the front) for individuals at launch.  (Approximately $350)\n* Print 4 flags, 2 small with and without words and 2 large ones with and without words. Will fly one to space as Zero G indicator and 1 large flag for group photo in front of booster after flight (Approximately $200)\n* Initial planning for a virtual launch day event or watch party for those who can’t be there in-person and to include the wider community.\n* Maintain interest as we await launch by fostering discussions and interactions among the MoonDAO community and wider space enthusiast communities through at least one social media post per week about this launch or Eiman.\n\n**Objective #3:** Identify Opportunities for Medical or Scientific Research\n\n**Key Results for Objective #3:**\n\n* Finalize any scientific or medical research with approval from the launch provider.\n* Identify costs for completing the research. Estimated costs of shipping to be covered.\n* Share data in an open source manner, when possible.\n\n**Objective #4:** Identify space conferences that Eiman could attend to provide publicity for MoonDAO\n\n* Compile a list of upcoming space related conferences in Q3 and Q4.\n* Determine if it would be valuable for Eiman to attend and possibly speak at these conferences\n\n**Objective #5:** Identify the payload Eiman will be taking to space as a courier/employee for MoonDao\n\n* Eiman will serve as a courier for MoonDAO on the upcoming New Shepard Flight. The goal is to identify what items he will carry in his payload for MoonDAO and what items he will carry on his person and potentially pull out as a zero G indicator.\n* Identify the hourly rate for Eiman’s work in space. He will receive payment for time in flight, actively serving as a courier, and not while on the ground or training.  Estimated rate $1000/hour with $250 being paid for the approximately 15 minute flight.\n\n**Objective #6:** Evaluating potential IP for website use.\n\n* Review photographs from Eiman’s recent photoshoot to determine if any are usable IP for MoonDAO website and advertising.\n\n```nance-actions\n--- nance-actions\n- type: Request Budget\n  payload:\n    projectTeam:\n      - discordUserId: \"926294531085856858\"\n        discordUsername: Dr. Eiman Jahangir\n        payoutAddress: \"0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000\"\n        votingAddress: \"0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000\"\n        isRocketeer: true\n      - discordUserId: \"892454397374775376\"\n        discordUsername: I24-Titan\n        payoutAddress: \"0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000\"\n        votingAddress: \"0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000\"\n        isRocketeer: false\n      - discordUserId: \"842541430186573894\"\n        payoutAddress: \"0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000\"\n        votingAddress: \"0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000\"\n        isRocketeer: false\n        discordUsername: ryand2d\n      - discordUserId: \"494739213137346561\"\n        payoutAddress: \"0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000\"\n        votingAddress: \"0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000\"\n        isRocketeer: false\n        discordUsername: pmoncada\n      - discordUserId: \"926244811177066558\"\n        payoutAddress: \"0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000\"\n        votingAddress: \"0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000\"\n        isRocketeer: false\n        discordUsername: Mitchie\n    multisigTeam:\n      - discordUserId: \"926294531085856858\"\n        discordUsername: Dr. Eiman Jahangir\n        address: \"0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000\"\n      - discordUserId: \"892454397374775376\"\n        discordUsername: I24-Titan\n        address: \"0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000\"\n      - discordUserId: \"842541430186573894\"\n        discordUsername: ryand2d\n        address: \"0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000\"\n      - discordUserId: \"494739213137346561\"\n        discordUsername: pmoncada\n        address: \"0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000\"\n      - discordUserId: \"926244811177066558\"\n        discordUsername: Mitchie\n        address: \"0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000\"\n    budget:\n      - token: \"0xA0b86991c6218b36c1d19D4a2e9Eb0cE3606eB48\"\n        amount: \"250\"\n        justification: Payment for acting as courier for MoonDAO’s payload $1,000 per\n          hour for a 15 minute flight\n      - token: \"0xA0b86991c6218b36c1d19D4a2e9Eb0cE3606eB48\"\n        amount: \"18000\"\n        justification: Stipend to community members and event organizers to attend the\n          on the ground launch event.\n      - token: \"0xA0b86991c6218b36c1d19D4a2e9Eb0cE3606eB48\"\n        amount: \"8000\"\n        justification: flex\n\n```",

      "content": "# Abstract\nMoonDAO Projects are the launch point for mission-aligned people to build on top of the foundation and network of MoonDAO.\n\nMoonDAO Projects are goal-oriented teams working on mission-aligned objectives. This document provides the framework to fund the team, support their progress, align their interests with the DAO, and provide retroactive incentives for projects that get us one step closer to a permanent settlement on the Moon.\n\nThis is a simplification of our Projects system (from 17 pages, down to 6), distilling some of our learnings into this next iteration of the projects system. Some new features:\n\n- Removing the crowdraising rules, since no one used those yet.\n\n- Removing the requirement for signatures on the document.\n\n- Changing the role of the delegate, the operations lead will do most of what the delegate used to do. Now the delegate helps throughout the project and receives 10% of the rewards as the champion of the project. If the rocketeer already has 250k vMOONEY then they don't need a delegate.\n\n- Upfront payments are subtracted on a per-project basis, rather than subtracting the total upfront from all projects.\n\n- A penalty is introduced if Moonsettlers do not update the community on their work in the progress channel every week. Same with Rocketeers that do not attend the weekly townhall meeting and give updates on the project's progress.\n\n- Project Proposal and Final Templates updated and moved to a new link.\n\n- Inclusion of the new community circle in the projects system, allocating 10% to the community circle every quarter.\n\nThe version with all the changes can be viewed here:\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1RLOvyUq5uFH7hprQytfLC-ux38-W2eICGrfeStGELgk/edit\n\nThe final version without comments can be viewed here:\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1jiIG4fatbVAK5Ga_8mn3TWawnPXMojK69OqU4rLAEU8/edit?usp=sharing\n\n# Total Cost\nNONE",

There's currently 629.0M $MOONEY in our treasury available for allocation. The plan outlined here has four major objectives:\n\n- Burning: The creation of a consistent burning schedule for the token of 3,000,000 $MOONEY per month for a year and a 14,000,000 $MOONEY burn when our second Astronaut is launched.\n\n- Financing: This proposal earmarks 300,000,000 $MOONEY for financing, and a plan to reach out to reputable institutions that might want to support our mission.\n\n- Locking: This proposal locks 179,000,000 $MOONEY for one year so it cannot be put into circulation.\n\n- Voting Rewards: This proposal earmarks 50,000,000 $MOONEY that will be distributed throughout the year to voters on MoonDAO Proposals, encouraging more people to stake their tokens.\n\n- Unallocated: 50,000,000 $MOONEY can be allocated via proposals. For example for projects, payments, marketing or other activities deemed appropriate by the community.\n\n# Total Cost\nMaximum of 579M $MOONEY",

By working on CVs, members of DeSci DAOs can easily contribute, get credited, and receive rewards for their contributions to science. The unified, open and decentralized infrastructure underpinning CVs ensures that contributions can build into a collective reputation over time, helping showcase both the individual work of a contributor and the collective efforts of a DAO.\n\nThis project outlines how MoonDAO could participate as an early adopter and collaborator to the system that allows this decentralized science to circulate and self-regulate in the open. It also places MoonDAO in a position to be an ambassador for space science in the DeSci community and have an active role in lunar research.\n\nContributors will be rewarded for their engagements on DeSci Labs in addition to the normal giving circle rewards.\n\n\nTotal Cost\n1 ETH",

However, we don’t have a simple method of onboarding an existing entity and creating an account for them at MoonDAO to participate as a private entity.\n\nThis was one of the original goals of the Project system, where each Project would be treated as a private organization, however in practice the nature of Projects makes them much more tied to MoonDAO processes and governance, with many stipulations and understanding of length documentation that needs to be comprehended before diving in as a project. Also, since Projects end and do not continue on indefinitely, there is no stable primitive to represent a group of people onchain. In contrast, entities can exist indefinitely, have no impact on governance or incentives, and can then opt-in to work on one (or many) projects and receive incentives for doing so.\n\nThis proposal aims to establish an onboarding flow for private entities to “build on MoonDAO,” such that they can create an onchain account with MoonDAO using Gnosis. Then, that account can participate as a private entity. The benefits of doing so would be clearly outlined and through a small registration fee will also be a source of income for the DAO. Entities could range from startups,  newly formed entities that do contract work for MoonDAO within Projects, nonprofits, existing companies that want to be competitors in Prizes, or create their own Projects.\n\nPreviously we tried to define a Partnership process to onboard entities using a more white-glove approach, however this still made it difficult for our partner entities to collaborate since often they don’t have an onchain way of interfacing with our governance or incentives in a simple way. So, even though we converted a few organizations, getting them to build on MoonDAO and follow through was difficult.\n\nSome potential first users of this system would be entities that we’ve onboarded as partners in the past like: Intuitive Machines, CryoDAO, DeSci Labs, Future Folklore, Lifeship, The Mars Society, Space For A Better World or other teams we are actively collaborating with and want to develop deeper relationships with like Nance, Juicebox, Gnosis, Hats Protocol, or startups that spin out of MoonDAO like Spacetime, or future “MoonDAO Labs” like entities that have their own container outside of governance.\n\nThis proposal aims to make a simple and straightforward flow for entities to build on MoonDAO without having governance requirements or complicated incentive systems built in, and instead they can opt into those systems through Projects or Prizes through their membership management portal.\n\nTotal Cost\n9.3770588275 ETH",

It uses a more objective system of recognizing contributors based on past performance in our quarterly retroactive rewards, asking them to stay involved in MoonDAO governance and allow them to perform tasks or self-start initiatives that would provide benefit and impact to MoonDAO but fall outside the scope of an existing project. We would also open a DAO-wide end of quarter Coordinape for any and all non-project contributions. This DAO-wide coordinape will have 10% set aside from the total retroactive rewards pool.\n\nThe primary benefits of this approach are:\nMeritocratic approach to governance and automatic removal if no longer delivering results\nAvoiding Senate capture or centralization by Executive Branch and ensuring higher governance participation\nEncouraging work across multiple projects\nRetention of contributors with the largest demonstrable impact\n\nTotal Cost\nNone",

When assets were tangible, trust was visible. \nBut that world has changed. \nWe believe in a world where users, creators, and enterprises manage their value with ownership and freedom, and with that in mind it would make a lot of sense for MoonDAO to partner up and  join the Ledger ecosystem. \nThe 1st step would be to test the waters through affiliate sales at this proposal. Later down the road, we can introduce a co-branded cold wallet edition, and other cool co-labs.\n\nTotal Cost\nNone",

MoonDAO needs a better system to retain the most impactful members and a mechanism to reward proactive doers for non-project contributions. This proposal will create a new, more objective system of recognizing Core Contributors based on past performance in our quarterly retroactive rewards, asking them to stay involved in MoonDAO governance and allow them to perform tasks or self-start initiatives that would provide benefit and impact to MoonDAO but fall outside the scope of an existing project (either because they are “too small” or more ambitious with an uncertain outcome or unlikely to be successful but offer a high potential impact). We would also open a DAO-wide end of quarter Coordinape for any and all non-project contributions. \n\n\nTotal Cost\nNone",

ConvertKit serves as the backbone of our email communication strategy, allowing us to maintain engagement with our ~12,400 subscribers. With a ~40% open rate and ~1-5% click-through rate, the MoonDAO Email List is indispensable for keeping our community informed of the latest campaigns and initiatives. Failure to make this payment would result in cancellation of the service and the loss of access to our email list which is a powerful communications platform which serves as a regular news source for MoonDAO.

However with delegation also comes security risks and these should be mitigated by a more centralized approach to handling secure operations in the DAO until they can be automated and decentralized, with checks and balances by the Senate and Member House to ensure that they retain the power in the community.\n\nThis proposal includes the official appointment of our first MoonDAO Astronaut through a ranked choice vote, along with some amount of budget to create a team of people to support the operations involved for core processes at MoonDAO.\n\nThe Astronaut will serve through the Constitutional 2-year term starting officially on July 1st, 2023, but the budget approach will be re-evaluated after 8 months when we select our next Astronaut.\n\nThe Astronaut's role will be directing the executive branch and more or less handling day-to-day operations, fulfilling duties as described in the Constitution, and navigating uncertainty. The Astronaut will also help with setting and updating the roadmap, vision, and priorities and executing towards those big picture objectives as voted by the members of the DAO.\n\nOther Astronaut vacancies will be added over time staggered at 8 month intervals so there would be an election every 8 months starting on July 1st 2023.\n\n\n## Total Cost\n8 ETH x month * 8 months = 64 ETH.",

However with delegation also comes security risks and these should be mitigated by a more centralized approach to handling secure operations in the DAO until they can be automated and decentralized, with checks and balances by the Senate and Member House to ensure that they retain the power in the community.\n\nThis proposal includes the official appointment of our first MoonDAO Astronaut through a ranked choice vote, along with some amount of budget to create a team of people to support the operations involved for core processes at MoonDAO.\n\nThe Astronaut will serve through the Constitutional term starting officially on July 1st, 2023, but the budget approach will be re-evaluated after 6 months.\n\n\n## Total Cost\n$88,000 DAI",

We are currently spending around $60K per quarter for project bonus, plus additional project cost which varies project by project. That said $500K in stable coin is enough for our one-year operation. \n\n## Specification:\nSwap $500k to Stable coins ($USDC, $DAI, $USDT) \nThe rest ~$700k in $ETH\n\nNo Project team & MVP.",

One member will be subsidized to sell merch IRL and on demand at the 3 main conferences in Brazil this quarter, promoting the MoonDao mission to send yan, our 2nd astronaut to space, and try to get diplomatic influence.  The merch sold on IRL events will have an exclusive polygon NFT attached to them with a floor price of 1,5 ETH marked, in the future, hodlers can purchase exclusive items and redeem discounts on MoonDao products and services. This way we can decrease the impact of the attendance at IRL events to the treasury, covering the stable coin costs at this test drive, and maybe bringing some revenue in at bigger proposals. \n\n## Total Cost\n3,000 DAI\n6.05 ETH\n386,000 $MOONEY\n\n",

      "content": "Please read the entire proposal before voting:\n\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1sNqH1z_-aUdzJkPdNOY1c5jJDaF3e2WJRHgNR7YV4qY/edit\n\n# Abstract\n\nMoonDAO wants to be part of real missions to the Moon and seeks products to engage the community and generate sustainable revenue. We propose MoonDAO joining as a partner to a DNA capsule mission to the Moon with LifeShip. The MoonDAO constitution, logo, and core documents would go in the capsule. Products would be sold and fulfilled through LifeShip for people to include their DNA and photos. LifeShip has procured the lunar mission with Firefly Aerospace for 2024 launch, designed the capsule, and will execute on the mission. This would be a statement for DAOs and governance beyond Earth, engage our community in a Moon mission, and provide a product to generate revenue.\n\nAn affiliate program would support sustainable revenue. LifeShip has Moon Kits for people to add their DNA, photos, ashes, or pet’s DNA to the mission. MoonDAO would sell these kits to generate revenue. Digital products could be sold with Mooney. MoonDAO would be a featured partner as part of the Launch Party and Moon Landing Party. This affiliate program will initially be for a 2024 launch and products can be continued to be sold for revenue generation for future launches.\n\nThis project will be for a 5 month marketing sprint to establish new products, prove revenue, and get MoonDAO represented on this mission to the Moon. \n\nLifeShip is a community-powered mission preserving the DNA of Earth’s biodiversity and humanity in space biobanks. LifeShip is saving a copy of Earth on the Moon and for future interstellar missions to populate new worlds.\n\nAdditionally, LifeShip is preparing to launch a DAO with a mission to preserve Earth and green the Universe. As part of this project, we will explore further partnerships and strategies for MoonDAO engagement and potential token stake in the launch of the LifeShipDAO.\n\n## Motivation\n\nThe motivation behind this MoonDAO project proposal is to give MoonDAO a physical presence on the Moon and a product for sustainable revenue. This would be a significant statement for DAOs and governance beyond Earth, and would engage the MoonDAO community in a unique and exciting mission. \n\n## Specification\n\nThis project involves a marketing sprint towards creating a revenue generating product for MoonDAO as part of a partnership sending a capsule to the Moon with LifeShip. The LifeShip capsule would be a coin-sized aluminum capsule. It would contain the MoonDAO constitution, logo, and core documents, as well as members’ photos, DNA, and names. \n\nThe mission would be carried out with the help of a SpaceX Falcon-9 rocket and a Firefly Blue Ghost lander, with a planned launch date of May 2024. All contents of the capsule must be delivered by August 1st 2023 to allow for time for assembly and printing the data into DNA. There is a likelihood that we will be able to extend delivery by several months. \n\nInformation gets encoded into synthetic DNA. People’s actual biological DNA gets preserved from a saliva sample. The DNA gets embedded in a Synthetic Amber Polymer in the capsule. Data also goes on a microchip in the capsule.\n\nFor the affiliate program, MoonDAO will sell the following products. Earning 50% for any sale on physical products and 50% for digital products (photos, music, videos…). Digital products can be paid for in Mooney. Physical products are to be bought in DAI.\n\n| PRODUCT                         | Retail Price | MoonDAO Share |\n|---------------------------------|--------------|---------------|\n| Send your DNA to the Moon       |          $99 |         $49.5 |\n| Send your pet’s DNA to the Moon |          $99 |         $49.5 |\n| Send ashes to the Moon          |         $399 |        $199.5 |\n| Send photos to the Moon         |          $16 |            $8 |\n\n### Marketing\n\nMarketing\nAs an affiliate reseller of DNA kits and data space, MoonDAO will be responsible for the direct sale and marketing of these products. This proposal establishes a team for an initial exploratory marketing campaign for these products. In order to maximize the revenue brought in by this project we will utilize our existing media channels, contact network, in-person engagements, and paid advertising to market these products. We will create designs for digital and physical media that can be distributed by members and incorporate the marketing of these products into other activities where appropriate. We will market the products in connection with the ZeroG flights.\n\nThe MoonDAO marketing team will also ensure compliance of marketing with MoonDAO branding and address any complaints directly related to this. Attention will also be paid to the ethical alignment of any paid advertising sources. \n\nA timeline of sales goals will also be maintained and published to ensure community awareness of the project. \n\nAffiliate relationship to continue for 2 years at these percentages and terms.\n\n## Benefits\n\nThe mission provides the following benefits:\n1. Mission aligned products to sell for revenue share\n2. Community engagement and sense of belonging for people to be part of a MoonDAO lunar mission\n3. MoonDAO brand awareness through launch parties, landing parties, PR, etc.\n4. A physical presence of sending MoonDAO contents to the Moon\n5. A platform to engage the MoonDAO community and send other digital contents to the Moon (a bounty code…)\n6. Opportunity for co branding naming rights of the capsule.\n\n## Risks\n\n1. The rocket could blow up or the lander could miss the moon or crash. If it does not make it to the Moon all content will be flown on another subsequent mission if possible.\n2. The marketing team could generate too little engagement around this mission.\n\n## Team Table\n\n| Project Stewards                             | AriBruce, Pablo, Ben Haldeman                                  |\n|----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Initial Team                                 | Ryand2d, Super.jellie (Stellie), Ballack, Pablo, Ben, name.get |\n| Sponsors                                     | AriBruce, Pablo                                                |\n| Foreign Language Representatives (optional)  | Ballack                                                        |\n| Multi-sig Signers (if Budget is needed)      | Ben Haldeman, AriBruce, Pablo, Ryand2d                         |\n\n## Total Cost\n\n#### 19,000 Dai\n#### 700,000 MOONEY\n\n",

MoonDAO supported DAODenver last year for $25,000. They have invited us again to be sponsors, and given the bear market we have decreased our sponsorship to $3,000.\n\n## Specification\n\nWe will provide a $1,000 stipend for up to five MoonDAO members based on seniority. Seniority defined as Astronaut > Guild Steward = Rocketeer > Moonsettler > Member. With tiebreaks based on when people joined the community. Please confirm your attendance with Pablo by February 14th. \n\nWe will also add $1,000 for each speaker at the event. The two speakers at this event will be Pablo and Justin.\n\nWe will also budget up to $1,000 for materials to hand out and other flexible spending or contingencies.\n\nPablo will be doing a fireside talk at DAODenver with Eric Mack (based on Eric’s availability, otherwise an alternative acceptable host will be selected), and we will also be on various panel discussions. We will also have a Table at DAODenver where we can hand out promotional materials, and we are working at incorporating a showcase, along with StudioDAO, to highlight and help fundraise for the “Ticket to Space” documentary.\n\n## Team Table\n\n| Team Steward                            | Pablo                                                          |\n|-----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Initial Team                            | DAOofSteve, pablo, justinpark01#2812, larrotiz, barney, manuel |\n| Sponsors                                | @Ballack (1 Rocketeer or Astronaut)                            |\n| Multi-sig Signers (if Budget is needed) | @Ballack, Pablo, Larrotiz, Barney, Luffy                       |\n\n## Total Cost\n\n#### $11,000 DAI\n\n",

A project member's rewards will be calculated as the quarter's total rewards multiplied by the percentage allocated to the project by the community and their percentage of an individual project as determined by each team’s Coordinape. \n\nThe DAI will be given as a lump-sum reward. The MOONEY will be streamed over the next year as long as the member remains engaged in a MoonDAO project as either a Steward or Moonsettler. This way members that work for a long time at MoonDAO will accrue rewards and we have an incentive for people to remain active at the DAO.\n\nThe amount of liquid non-Mooney assets is $581,100 (447 ETH calculated using the average, 3-month Q4 price of $1,300) and $598,829 DAI (subtracting $100k for the documentary project) for a total of $1,179,929, representing a total distribution of $58,996.45.\n\n**Note:** For Q4 2022 we will not be subtracting up-front payments since this was not factored into projects that were already started. However, going forward we will be subtracting them.\n\n\n## Voter Options\n\nPlease read the details of the reports and distribute your voting power between the projects you’d like to support with bonus incentives based on the impact of the project.\n\nYou may agree with the distribution that the Senate has provided as an averaged recommendation, or you may provide your own distribution.\n\nFor example allocation of:\n10% of tokens for Project 1 = 10% of incentives will go to Project 1\n5% of tokens for Project 2 = 5% of incentives will go to Project 2\nAnd so on\n\nYou may also view the proposal as a Google Doc for easier viewing of the table here:\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1BGBQxAqxmYr1F6eHzoIKsxAh3Z_Rjhy3Pt73YDff0nQ/edit#\n",

The DAO will vote on the proportion of those rewards that will be sent out between all the projects that were completed in Q4 2022.\n\n## Specification\n\nSee the full analysis of incentives here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-tFwiDTuiGB24Z2bAoEIUQxShtUvaTbThtNC5vu8vYE/edit#gid=94503660\n\n\n| Project Title             | In one sentence                                             | Project Proposal                                                                                                 | Final Report                                                                                     | Rocketeer Rec. |\n|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------|\n| New World's Conference    | One MoonDAO member at the New World's Conference            | https://docs.google.com/document/d/19MwM1b1elYPUWFP9M_f3G0_6A0LsBAroizr1HU3hIso/edit                             | https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qe2c7d4J91HsbhyEJdSqk90xazjzNdFkxmlkd26IGpM/edit?usp=sharing |          2.73% |\n| Mars Society conference   | Two MoonDAO members at the Mars Society Conference          | https://snapshot.org/#/tomoondao.eth/proposal/0x3dde0fa972bf66f93225e62a00a8cffa94f7c8895ee419cd6097951345b03856 | https://drive.google.com/file/d/1l4mMgx3x2B11QEDztbWx-JAZJgRAtYvf/view?usp=sharing               |          4.12% |\n| Newsletter and Onboarding | Onboarding and newsletter with 11,891 readers               | https://snapshot.org/#/tomoondao.eth/proposal/0x55e58314b14a99d3694ba450b7930fd80140fc4ff6b6ba108921a13af70d69f0 | https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LdLvamsp381YZVeJUJIhPsTlyrZ15vX03bEZ6_Jh79g/edit?usp=sharing |         19.23% |\n| Website                   | New landing page, dashboard, and documentation              | https://snapshot.org/#/tomoondao.eth/proposal/0xc6fda163ea8b6b8d278f6c3c090e1a1bb1cc5b4883ac24d65736eabdd6625de9 | https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ybijQtJIHBGH6AVdV5o_QeSbWWBOt8934o1-hVRjeLA/edit             |         25.69% |\n| Stake to Vote             | Staking to vote with vMOONEY, dev for frontend and contract | https://snapshot.org/#/tomoondao.eth/proposal/0x0ead9de8beced5fbdba9ef6ec6fcc7d993151f1cfd7e909ebd773e0266a1d447 | https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QpfPsuSzoIuLi4QQ3m5wA25M5NABhuJEEgMcoGcnvrg/edit             |         21.08% |\n| Guild Guidelines          | First iteration on rules and documentation for Guilds       | https://snapshot.org/#/tomoondao.eth/proposal/0x5e5af60a470eec6e8326bd9ae5c125180b013894a619c7af0c1a38a86e8d7bd0 | https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NqAf5ByBMkVKr5QrWF2QwqQOphwoBVISwaA8J5joomw/edit?usp=sharing |          5.23% |\n| 101xyz Courses            | MoonDAO education classes with 3,400 completions            | https://snapshot.org/#/tomoondao.eth/proposal/0x3ef76191c552314f6fc1175dcbaeda684d1729c07c18c034e599c32863c12864 | https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zTXk1VQGkhJqdgOD7J9Mfl4ONonnA9uCD7y9YtZr8Dk/edit?usp=sharing |          5.00% |\n| IAC Conference            | Four MoonDAO members at the biggest space conference.       | https://snapshot.org/#/tomoondao.eth/proposal/0x9c188ae37526d22d940d10a66c0680fc6d11b343b69367c3e27276cc13d95120 | https://drive.google.com/file/d/13TA2WNxWO26FlCAPS3Lsq1-PJACGpVZH/view?usp=sharing               |          5.15% |\n| Interim Guild Setups      | Creation of the first four guilds with interim stewards.    | N/A                                                                                                              | https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WFz_SzH8enWwbbGaf4w3jn_PvdIErCLTVtGSnm9JN7Q/edit#            |         11.77% |\n\n\nThe total rewards for Q4 2022 projects will be calculated as 5% of the liquid non-Mooney assets, paid in the form of DAI, and 15 million MOONEY. A project member's rewards will be calculated as the quarter's total rewards multiplied by the percentage allocated to the project by the community and their percentage of an individual project as determined by each team’s Coordinape. \n\nThe DAI will be given as a lump-sum reward. The MOONEY will be streamed over the next year as long as the member remains engaged in a MoonDAO project as either a Steward or Moonsettler. This way members that work for a long time at MoonDAO will accrue rewards and we have an incentive for people to remain active at the DAO.\n\nThe amount of liquid non-Mooney assets is $581,100 (447 ETH calculated using the average, 3-month Q4 price of $1,300) and $598,829 DAI (subtracting $100k for the documentary project) for a total of $1,179,929, representing a total distribution of $58,996.45.\n\n**Note:** For Q4 2022 we will not be subtracting up-front payments since this was not factored into projects that were already started. However, going forward we will be subtracting them.\n\n\n## Voter Options\n\nPlease vote between YES or NO for the total amount of incentives to be distributed to the team for Q4 2022.\n",

      "content": "## Abstract\nThe MoonDAO Email List has proven to be a successful tool for onboarding new subscribers and keeping them informed about MoonDAO's activities. In Q1 2023, we propose continuing to make the most of the email list's capabilities by continuing the weekly Mooney Monday update email, implementing the incentives for a refer-a-friend system (currently live, but without incentives), and exploring opportunities for monetization through sponsorships and affiliate marketing. These changes will further increase participation and involvement in MoonDAO, and help to generate revenue for the organization. The MoonDAO email list currently has over 11,500 subscribers with a 44% open rate, making the email list one of our largest and most powerful means of communication. See final report from Q4.\n\n## Team\nStewards: @ryand2d\n\n## OKRs\n\n**Objective #1:** Update Autoresponder Sequences + Add New Ones + Maintenance\n**Key Results for Objective #1:** \n- Update any factual changes within the two large existing autoresponder sequences with regard to governance or internal changes.\n- Create a new cold subscriber sequence and tag which will attempt to warm up any inactive members before they are tagged for deletion, in an attempt to keep the list clean and ensure we aren’t paying for inactive users.\n- Add some additional emails to the general sequence promoting the refer-a-friend system and encouraging users to share the email list with friends or on social media.\n- Adding in more content like images, screenshots, gifs, or video links within the two large autoresponder sequences to make it more dynamic and engaging instead of a wall of text (based on feedback from the survey).\n\n**Objective #2:** Weekly Mooney Monday Emails\n**Key Results for Objective #2:**\n- Start up the weekly Mooney Monday emails again with space news, and MoonDAO updates, such as those seen on the public MoonDAO emails page\n\n**Objective #3:** Create a PDF Sponsorship document\n**Key Results for Objective #3:**\n- Compiling info and statistics with info about the MoonDAO email list in a small 1-2 page PDF document with rates that we can share with Web3 or Space Organizations.\n- Create snippet codes within ConvertKit that will allow us to easily embed any text or image advertisements within the existing body of emails and allow us to swap them out or change them in the future without having to edit individual emails. \n\n\n## Total Budget\n10,375 DAI\n650,000 $MOONEY\n\nPlease read the full proposal before voting:\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1N95G5-dKzWaE7oQw2j-IoNVuu6xJrZoC-isFETiwRyM/edit#",

      "content": "## Abstract\nThe Space Engineering Guild will organize our engineering resources to take on consulting bounties from external aerospace companies, as well as incubate proof of concepts to create engineering projects for MoonDAO. The guild will also provide common resources to engineers, assess and adopt new tools to ease collaboration, educate aspiring space engineers, and vet people for technical knowhow and engineering abilities to grow our network of Space professionals.\nThe proposal itself sets the initial foundation for the Guild and is structured as a three month MoonDAO Project. This means that the members helping to set up the Guild will be included in the Project Incentive system as a project, to set up the Guild and get it to a stable place where the guild ecosystem takes on its own network effects.\n\n## Team\nSteward: pmoncada, Rod, AriBruce\n\n## OKRs\n\nGuild Objectives:​\n\n1. Clarify the ultimate vision through a technical feasibility analysis to put together a technical roadmap towards achieving our ultimate goal. (Pablo, Ari, Rod, Sean Manuel)\n- Task 1.1: Outline requirements and specifications on our Ultimate Goal of putting a self-sustaining, self-governing settlement on the Moon. (Pablo Lead)\n- Task 1.2: Conduct a broad industry analysis of companies and nations with unique Space capabilities and offerings that would help us achieve our ultimate goal and form strategic partnerships with those groups. (Ari Lead)\n- Task 1.3: (Contingent on 1 & 2) Create a full technical roadmap that works back from the ultimate goal with step-by-step milestones (e.g. one year plan, five year plan, ten year plan). (Pablo Lead)\n- Task 1.4: Bring in subject area experts to speak to the DAO (Rod Lead)\n- Task 1.5 Help advise and review reports about technical feasibility in each of the three outlined areas. (Rod Lead)\n\n2. Establish consistent Space Engineering Guild Internal Operations and toolsets/workflows for decentralized software and hardware coordination. (Pablo, Rod)\n- Task 2.1: Taking weekly guild notes, notification management (announcing when meetings are starting, collecting an agenda. (Rod Lead)\n- Task 2.2: Investigation of available tooling and options for distributed hardware workflows, and operational workflows (investigating, deciding, integrating in the MoonDAO workflow). (Rod Lead)\n- Task 2.3: Investigation and purchase of general common resources that would enable our teams to be more effective and we can make available to guild members. (Rod Lead)\n- Task 2.4: Maintenance of Kanban board for task organization and maintenance, checking in on task deliverables and contingencies. Payment operations for contributors. (Rod Lead)\n- Task 2.5: Review incoming applications and assess their backgrounds on a consistent weekly basis, and assign them a Discord role, onboarding them, and providing support for orientation of the new members. (Pablo Lead)\n- Task 2.6: Moderate and lead weekly guild discussions, making an agenda ahead of time and organizing the conversation for productive use of people’s time. (Pablo Lead)\n- Taks 2.7: Create new bounties for contingent work for the DAO. Or bounties that serve as an onboarding a technical test for new contributors. (Rod Lead)\n\n3. Conducting feasibility studies on topics and projects that are currently under-funded challenges and bottlenecks (across logistical, engineering, operations) that would accelerate a settlement on the Moon. (Phil, Pablo, Ari, Sean, Rod)\n- Task 3.1: Lunar communications infrastructure and technology. Especially how a DAO can use its governance to create nation-agnostic infrastructure. (Phil Lead)\n- Task 3.2: Bioresearch and astrobiology. Biological life support systems analysis. Radiation shielding, food, structures. How a DAO can help tackle some of these challenges. (Ari Lead)\n- Task 3.3: In-situ resource utilization. Energy, water, material use on the Moon. How a DAO can help create neutral resources to create a foundation for other settlers to build upon. (Rod Lead)\n- Task 3.4: Establish a common set of criteria for evaluating ideas that extends on the following rough criteria: (Pablo Lead)\n\n\n4. Find one space engineering firm that is willing to outsource some of their tasks to create a bounty on our DeWork page as a pilot for a revenue stream in the DAO. (Pablo)\n- Task 4.1: Find at least one partner that is mission aligned with MoonDAO and is willing to have MoonDAO’s guild to complete a bounty for them. (Pablo Lead)\n- Task 4.2: Manage the logistical, operations, and legal around matching that task with guild members and the right revenue split between the member and the company. (Pablo Lead)\n\n5. Figure out ways to converge Decentralized Science and Open Hardware to benefit the overall development of new and existing technology within MoonDAO. (Manuel Lead)\n- Task 5.1 Identify, build and implement Decentralized Science tools for scientists to contribute their research to MoonDAO. (Manu)\nBuild a Database of Patents/Papers related to the Space Tech Roadmap\nMap challenges in the academic world.\nCreate DeSci tools overview.\n- Task 5.2 More qualified space scientists should be drawn to MoonDAO. (Manu)\nFoster partnerships and collaboration with universities. Find at least one partner.\nIdentify and execute on Sponsoring- and Open Innovation opportunities (ideally to create more awareness and engagement for under-funded challenges with official stakeholders).\n- Task 5.3 More futurists should be inspired to join MoonDAO (Manu)\nFoster collaboration with Future Studies Institutes.Find at least one partner.\nCreate frameworks for Science Fiction Prototyping.\nImplement radical convergence of Science Fiction and Science Fact concepts in the ideation process.\n- Task 5.4 Drive more Rapid Prototyping/Additive Manufacturing Professionals to MoonDAO with knowledge in 3D modeling and Simulations to support the Space Engineering Guild. (Manu)\n- Task 5.5 Connect more Intellectual Property attorneys focusing on Spacetech with MoonDAO.

There is a lot of detail in this document:\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1PkwgKvHox2lury1ThKGeDvaVxEl3JILP/view\n\n## Proposal Options\n\n### Option A: $0 MoonDAO Treasury funding of the proposal\n\n- Filmmakers will design and kick-off a StudioDAO campaign as best they can with $0 funding and their personal resources.\n\n### Option B: $50K USD MoonDAO Treasury funding of the proposal (+) 600K $MOONEY for Bounties\n\n- Filmmakers will onboard a “Monthly Updates Producer/Editor” to support in delivering\nclips, teasers, activations, and social content needed to promote the project and fuel\nthe StudioDAO Campaign\n- Filmmakers will have funds for story development, and will be able to finalize\npre-production for the 1st shoot.\n- The budget amount for bounties is listed in $MOONEY, but as the price is\nexpected to change over time, it will be up to the discretion of the filmmakers to\nchange bounty rewards according to real price changes. Unused overflow will\nalways be returned to the treasury.\n\nOption C: $100K USD from MoonDAO Treasury for Launch Strategy (+) 1.5M $MOONEY for Bounties\n- Same activities as Option B\n- This funding amount will secure enough initial funding for the production of the 1st Shoot, as well as pre-production for the 2nd Shoot.\n- Footage from the 1st Shoot will be used to market the film for the subsequent rounds of crowd-raising campaigns on StudioDAO.\n- If $150K is not successfully raised by the filmmakers from all financiers and funding sources (StudioDAO campaign, grants received, additional independent investors brought in, etc), by date of the Blue Origin Launch, MoonDAO may choose to terminate their involvement in the film’s funding. The Film LLC would agree to return the balance and remainder of the original investment amount not then used up concerning production expenses. Note that the expenses used for creating the crowdfunding campaign, legal fees, script development, pre-production, and production cannot be refunded after already spent.\n- The same termination agreement, and return of any remaining balance, will apply for any other Act of God circumstance that may prevent the progress of the film’s further funding and production. In the event the film production can be resumed, and the halt on production is only temporary, the filmmakers will retain all money in the account to finish the film production and complete the film as best they can.\n- If production is halted and the agreement is terminated due to filmmakers being unable to raise enough funds from all funding sources combined, the filmmakers will license the raw footage clips to MoonDAO for their use. In addition, to the most extent possible, the filmmakers will cut a high-quality 20-minute short film from the footage that was captured up to that point in time. The filmmakers will not proceed with any MoonDAO expenses, nor with post-production expenses of the 20-minute short film without further approval from MoonDAO on how to return or allocate remaining funds.\n\n\n### Option D: $300K from MoonDAO Treasury for Launch Plus Essential Production (+) 5M $MOONEY for Bounties\n- Same activities as Option B\n- This investment amount will secure close to 75%* of the most essential production costs, which can ensure the film will be made with high confidence, and rely less on crowdfunding overall. (*38-55% of total cost)\n- At this investment amount, there will no longer be contractual termination rights for unsatisfactory funding to halt the project.\n- Should production of the film be halted by an Act of God or any other unforeseen thing, to the point where the film cannot be completed with integrity, the Film LLC would agree to return the balance and remainder of the original investment amount not then used up. In the event the film production can be resumed, and the halt on production is only temporary, the filmmakers will retain all money in the account to finish the film production and complete the film as best they can.\n",

There is a lot of detail in this document:\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1qncBHFkEbLS1XUx1UQEaHmUIIvPAIqaR/view\n\n## Total Budget\n- 25,000 Dai maximum budget for legal fees. This will be returned if the full amount is not used.\n- 5,000 Dai for MVP to the Project Steward for coordinating with the team.\n\n\n## Proposal Options\n\n### Option A: YES \n- MoonDAO wants the filmmaker team led by @furda and @cowtools to have access to Yan and other MoonDAO members (individuals who are open to being filmed) to tell the proposed story \n- MoonDAO supports the filmmaker team to partner with StudioDAO on raising funds and distribution \n- A Yes vote grants the above with no commitment of funds from the MoonDAO treasury allocated to the Film LLC (the filmmakers). Options $0-$300K will be available to vote on in Proposal Two. \n- A Yes vote grants the above along with an allocation for a $25,000 maximum in MoonDAO treasury funds to be available for potential legal fees that may or may not occur due to the film being made. While this budget is allocated for use on an as-needed basis, there are scenarios in which $0 legal fees may be incurred such as potentially with Proposal 2 Option 1 ($0 funding) as the winner. Legal fees will be required to draw up a contract between MoonDAO and the Film LLC for the options offered in Proposal 2. \n- A Yes vote grants a $5000 Minimum viable salary to the project steward. \n\nOption B: NO \n- MoonDAO does not support access and the proposed approach. \n\n",

A vote on the total amount of MOONEY they believe should be awarded in total to the contributors for their efforts over the span of the year.\n#3. A vote on the amount of DAI that should be awarded in total to the contributors for their efforts over the span of the year.\n\nWe have conducted the coordinape with each of the teams internally, and the final amounts going to each contributor will be published to the community.

      "content": "### This is a retroactive reward proposal for the MoonDAO contributors from the period of January 17th 2022 to October 1st 2022.\n\n## This proposal is broken up into three snapshots:\n\n#1. A vote on the proportion they believe each project should get at MoonDAO.\n#2. A vote on the total amount of MOONEY they believe should be awarded in total to the contributors for their efforts over the span of the year.\n**#3. A vote on the amount of DAI that should be awarded in total to the contributors for their efforts over the span of the year.**\n\nWe have conducted the coordinape with each of the teams internally, and the final amounts going to each contributor will be published to the community. This information can be found here: https://app.coordinape.com/organizations/1394, and the original Phase 2 spreadsheet to collect contributions and eligibility for projects can be found here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/1/d/1K2h4At6J_hT3rDUqaY_28hh1SvhDo7V9A9e6cbQtG_8/edit#gid=1198315761\n\n# Proposal 3 of 3: Total amount of DAI Rewards allocated for Phase 2 Contributors\n\n## Abstract\nThis vote is identical to vote (2/3) with two major differences:\n1. It will determine the amount of DAI distributed to contributors.\n2. DAI will be sent in a lump-sum, rather than streamed over the course of a year.\n\n\n## Specification\nThis vote will determine the total amount of DAI rewards allocated from the treasury to distribute to Contributors for their work in Phase 2.\n\nThe DAO will vote on the proportion of DAI allocated for Phase 2 to determine the TotalDAIDistributed as outlined below:\n\nTotal Dai Allocated = TotalNonMOONEYAssetsInTreasury * (Proportion of DAI allocated for Phase 2)\n\nWhere TotalNonMOONEYAssetsInTreasury = 1,352,220 DAI + 509,407.38855 DAI (in ETH) = 1,861,627.38855 DAI\n\nThe amount of DAI sent to each contributor will be determined as follows (pseudocode):\n\ncontributorProportion = 0\nfor each Project:\n----- contributorProportion += % allocated to project * % of GIVE the received within the project\n\nTotal DAI for contributor = Total DAI Allocated * contributorProportion\n\nWhere:\n% allocated to project is determined in vote (1/3)\n% of GIVE receiver within the project was determined on Coordinape\n\nThe total DAI for each contributor will be distributed as a lump sum.\n\nThe rocketeers have each determined a proportion that they feel is correct to distribute to the Phase 2 Contributors, this averaged out to 14.17% of the Total Dai in the treasury.\n\n# Voting Options\n\nYou may spread your voting power out over each of the available options to determine a percentage that you think is fair. For example, if spreading tokens evenly between 20% and 30% that would equate to a vote for 25%.",

The DAO will vote on the proportion of MOONEY allocated for Phase 2 from the treasury as outlined below:\n\nTotal MOONEY Distributed = TotalMOONEYInTreasury * (Proportion of MOONEY allocated for Phase 2)\n\nWhere TotalMOONEYInTreasury = 1,198,465,829 MOONEY\n\nThe proportion of MOONEY sent to each contributor from the total will be determined as follows (pseudocode):\n\ncontributorProportion = 0\nfor each MoonDAO Project:\n----- contributorProportion += (% allocated to project) * (% of GIVE received within the project)\n\nTotal MOONEY for contributor = Total MOONEY Distributed * contributorProportion\n\nWhere:\n% allocated to each project is determined in vote (1/3)\n% of GIVE received within the project is determined on Coordinape (linked above)\n\nSimilar to Phase 1 payments, this amount will be streamed to each MoonDAO member over the period of a year, as long as they are still engaged within the DAO. Engagement is defined by contributing to a MoonDAO project as a Moonsettler or Rocketeer (see more in the Project system: docs.moondao.com/project-guidelines).\n\nTherefore, it is unlikely that the full amount allocated will actually be distributed, since members may become inactive over the next year.\n\nThe rocketeers have each determined a proportion that they feel is correct to distribute to the Phase 2 Contributors, this averaged out to 20% of the Total MOONEY in the treasury. This is offered as a default option for members to choose, although they may manually decide what they think is fair.\n\n## Voting Options\n\nYou may choose the default option if you agree with the Rocketeers, otherwise you may spread your voting power out over each of the available options to determine a percentage that you think is fair. For example, if spreading tokens evenly between 20% and 30% that would equate to a vote for 25%.\n",

      "content": "## Newsletter Budget Extension\n\n**ConvertKit Pricing:** With the recent Dude Perfect video, newsletter sign-ups have exploded much more rapidly than anticipated. The original proposal did not take this into account and had a budget for up to 300 subscribers (with an original OKR of 100 sign-ups). As of Wednesday, we have passed four different pricing tiers, and are quickly approaching the next pricing tier which takes effect after 8,000 subscribers. A good problem to have for the DAO.\n\n$1,390 billed annually for up to 8,000 subscribers ← CURRENT BILLED PLAN\n$1,670 billed annually for up to 10,000 subscribers\n$2,090 billed annually for up to 15,000 subscribers\n\nryand2d has put these charges on a personal credit card which is already billed for over $1,200 $1,400. With subscribers still coming in from the video, we need to set aside money in the multi-sig for up to 15k subscribers to ensure we still have room to grow and future reimbursements can happen in a timely manner.\n\nMVP Change: ryand2d is requesting a small increase in MVP (~16%) for the additional workload not scoped out in the original proposal with the Dude Perfect video launch, this includes marketing funnel, form implementation, and analytics efforts with the website team (Larrotiz and Mitchie) for https://www.moondao.com/dude-perfect, implementation of additional emails not scoped out in original sequence (MoonDAO events, and extra follow up in Initial Onboarding Funnel), as well as crisis response after launch trying to get sending live again on Saturday when ConvertKit temporarily shut down emails due to the massive influx of subscribers from Dude Perfect that blew past our account limits. Requesting an additional $250 DAI and 25,000 Mooney, and requesting a change to the distribution of ryand2d MVP to release 50% of the MVP upon completion of the ~14 autoresponder sequences instead of waiting until after the end of the year when the project deadline has passed.\n\n## Budget Change Summary:\n\nConvertKit from $290 → $2,290 total in anticipation of further growth, return unused to the treasury\nMVP from $1,500 DAI & 150,000 Mooney → $1,750 DAI & 175,000 Mooney total\n\nTotal NEW Budget (including guaranteed payments to team members):  \n$5,040 Dai\n225,000 $MOONEY\n\nPlease read the full proposal update before voting:\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1e4gvaCwuaSl_TuNPRlBI77TjSE8myvzdQo9DP7O-YaM/",

      "content": "## MoonDAO Contributors! Please vote on the first iteration of the MoonDAO Guild Guidelines.\n\nThis document is an important milestone for MoonDAO as we create transparent and autonomous process for guild establishments and put the fate of the DAO into the hands of the MoonDAO community.\n\nBefore presenting the link to the full document, here is a quick overview of the key features of the MoonDAO Guild guideline.\n\n## MoonDAO Guilds \n\nMoonDAO Guilds are talent pools to onboard, orient, and train members to complete bounties for MoonDAO projects. \n\n## Guild Stewards\nGuilds are operated by Guild Stewards who are responsible for:\n- Onboarding and orienting new members\n- Ensuring the quality of their guild members which includes but not limited to: Interviewing their new members to ensure they have all necessary skills relevant to the guild, and provision of regular training and educational opportunities to their guild members\n- Supporting MoonDAO projects to find the right resource and help their guild members get started on MoonDAO bounties and projects\n\n## How is a MoonDAO Guild created?\n\nThis process is similar to the Project Proposal process with few modifications based on the nature of Guilds. Basically, any MoonDAO member that meets the following requirements can propose a new guild and steward the guild:\n- Obtain and hold a role of Rocketeer or MoonSettler for at least one month. Proof of work is required before someone can start a Guild.\n- Possess good knowledge and experience in their field.\n- Successfully recruit at least 3 initial members for their guild.\n- Be sufficiently differentiated from any existing guilds, this is subjective and other DAO members can weigh in.\n\n## The MoonDAO Guild guidelines\nSo, without further ado, here is the MoonDAO Guild Guideline. Please read it carefully before voting, and feel free to ask questions anywhere on the document (the document is open to comments), and we'll try to have people from the team available to answer. \n\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1Y7jJoItTdnuqbxoKAOHQeWDJKhlCB0fE/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=117773310877396900461&rtpof=true&sd=true\n\n\n## Voting\nThe Guild Guideline will be adopted if a majority of 70% of the DAO members vote \"Yes\" to adopt it.",

      "title": "MDP-32: The MoonDAO Constitution",
      "content": "#### MoonDAO Contributors! The time has come to vote on the first iteration of the MoonDAO Constitution.\n\nThis document has been a long time in the making, and it's a huge milestone for MoonDAO as we decentralize further and put the fate of the DAO into the hands of the token holders. We involved as many voices as we could into the process, and our community has deeply debated each of the articles of the Constitution. \n\nWe are very proud to present what the community has put together.\n\nBefore presenting the link to the full document, here is a quick overview of the key features of the MoonDAO Constitution and some of our reasoning behind the design decisions.\n\n# Mission Statement\n\nThe Constitution begins with our mission statement. When we started, MoonDAO's mission statement was simply \"to decentralize access to space research and exploration,\" we've expanded on that mission to include a concrete goal: \n\n\"MoonDAO’s mission is to create a self-sustaining, self-governing settlement on the Moon by 2030 to act as a launch point for humanity to explore the cosmos.\"\n\nWe've also included statements on our vision and values as we move towards that goal. These include commitments of transparency with the use of MoonDAO funds, transparency of communication, and the bottom-up nature of our organization.\n\n# Governance Staking\n\nFor the average token holder the biggest change (if this constitution is approved) is that we are moving to a *staked* governance system. What this means is that to vote on proposals you'll need to take your MOONEY governance tokens and lock them for a period of time. Your voting power will depend on how many tokens you lock, and for how long.\n\nThe reason we are doing this is because we want MoonDAO to have a long-term time horizon. Moving towards a staked governance system is beneficial to both the long-term holders (people concerned with governance are focused on longer time horizons), and for the short-term traders (the total supply of MOONEY goes down because it is locked).\n\nYou can stake your MOONEY for as little as 1 week to as much as 4 years, in return you'll receive a non-transferable vMOONEY (voting MOONEY). As an example, here is how voting power is determined for each member:\n\n100 MOONEY staked 4 years = 100 vMOONEY\n100 MOONEY staked 2 years = 50 vMOONEY\n100 MOONEY staked 1 year = 25 vMOONEY\n\nThen, on any given MoonDAO proposal we will take the square root of the amount of vMOONEY to calculate your final voting power. This change in governance solidifies our commitment that MoonDAO is not a speculative token for a one-time mission, but a long-term organization.\n\nIt's important to note that the amount of vMOONEY you have will dynamically decrease as you get closer to your unlock date. For example, if you stake 4 years, after 2 years have passed you'll have half the vMOONEY.\n\n# Submitting Proposals\n\nThe Constitution also allows for anyone in MoonDAO with more than 250,000 vMOONEY to submit proposals directly to the MoonDAO Senate. To be clear, anyone inside of the DAO can discuss and suggest proposals, however to formally submit them you'll need the co-signature of someone with greater than 250,000 vMOONEY.\n\n# MoonDAO Senate\n\nSubmitted proposals will first go to the MoonDAO Senate. This house is simply one-person-one-vote. You cannot buy your way into becoming a MoonDAO senator. The only way to earn entry is by taking on the responsibility of leading a key objective inside of the DAO. In other words, the only way in is by proof-of-work (leading a MoonDAO project).\n\nThe primary reason behind having a MoonDAO Senate is that it creates a separate, and difficult to corrupt, body of people that have high-context about MoonDAO and its operations. This is a higher entropy governance body that will review proposals before they go up to voting by the broader DAO, and ensures that proposals that are going up to the DAO are feasible to implement, make sense given the context of the DAO, fit within the DAO's core values and mission, and generally do a more in-depth audit of proposals and the risks involved.\n\n# Treasury Signers\n\nAnother added layer of security are the treasury signers, these are the seven signers that protect MoonDAO's treasury. After a proposal is approved by the Senate and Member Houses, on-chain execution of the proposal will be done by the signers. The signers also have an added power of giving a veto, if they believe that the execution of the proposal would cause long term harm to the DAO.\n\n# Astronaut Roles\n\nLastly, there is a role that is voted on by the DAO that has the power to replace members of the multisig wallet (appointments are ratified by the DAO). This role is called the \"Astronaut\" role. It is reserved for the most trusted members inside of the DAO, to protect the DAO's operations.\n\nThe reason to have a separate role that chooses the appointments of the multisig is to ensure that the wallet is always in trusted hands. Appointments must always be ratified by the DAO before they are confirmed as signers.\n\nFurthermore, the Astronaut has the ability to appoint and remove moderators that enforce the code of conduct.\n\nAs we all know, moderators can sometimes abuse their powers, so having some checks and balances with a trusted person inside of the DAO that can remove or add new moderators should help prevent abuse of power. There may be cases where members of the Senate break the code of conduct, and the Astronaut must review this enforcement. However, this removal can be appealed through the appeal process, which is available to any member that is removed from channels of communication.\n\n# The MoonDAO Constitution\n\nSo, without further ado, here is the MoonDAO Constitution. Please read it carefully before voting, and feel free to ask questions anywhere on the document (the document is open to comments), and we'll try to have people from the Constitution team available to answer. This is a huge step for MoonDAO and we're very excited to be giving more power into the hands of the community!\n\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1fjcQZflrRsM6-qynMRuFG2AYGiNFLIC7vStNZLazxFY/edit?pli=1#\n\n# Voting\n\nThe Constitution will be adopted if a majority of 70% of the DAO members vote \"Yes\" to adopt it.",

      "title": "MDP-31: Bank Account Proposal",
      "content": "## Abstract\nTo facilitate transactions between MoonDAO and entities that do not yet accept cryptocurrencies, a bank account is needed under MoonDAO’s name.\n\n## Motivation/Benefits\nTo make it easier for MoonDAO to complete fiat payments with outside organizations and facilitate logistics for MoonDAO events. Previous examples where a bank account would’ve prevented issues include facilitating purchase of Blue Origin seats or making payments for the Texas launch party. Future use of the bank account may include paying for satellite launches or funding space research for outside organizations with fiat currency.\n\n## Specification\nMoonDAO currently has established a legal entity in Macau. Under this legal entity, we will open a Macau business bank account which requires a minimum deposit of $50,000 to open. The deposit amount will be returned to the multi-sig after the minimum period of time required by the bank. The brunt of work for this project will be the legal work and logistics of opening up this account. \n\nThere are a number of potential banks we may use: \nDBS Bank (Hong Kong), Sucursal de Macau\nBanco da China, Sucursal de Macau\nBanco Comercial Português, Sucursal de Macau\nIndustrial and Commercial Bank of China (Macau) Limited\n\nOnce opened, any future projects in need of making payments through bank transfer may deposit necessary multi-sign funds to the account to make payments. Pablo and Barney will have direct access to the account.\n\n## Risks\nMoonDAO funds temporarily stored in the account will be under centralized control. Owners and managers of the account must be trusted members of the community to prevent mishandling.\n\n## Transparency\nIn order to allow the community to see MoonDAO's bank account details openly and transparently, we will publish a bank statement once a month (on discord).\nDetails about the company card: This corporate account allows us to have a physical bank card, which is of the type Debit Card. Pablo will be the primary holder of the card. The card may be moved to a future astronaut if necessary.\n\n\n## Objectives and Key Results:\n \nObjective #1: Successfully open a MoonDAO bank account\nKey Results for Objective #1: \nDeposit $50,000 from the Multisig into the account Deposit is refundable after the period required by the bank.\nSuccessfully complete payments with wire transfer and physical cards\n\n\n## Team Table (Table A)\nTeam Leads: Barney\nInitial Team: Barney, Larrotiz\nSponsors: Pablo\nMulti-sig Signers (if Budget is needed): One-time payment\nForeign Language Representatives (optional): Barney\n\n\n### Team Leader(s) Bio: Barney\n\nBarney is a Private Fund owner in Macau and also is a core contributor for MoonDAO.The Fund background provides a lot of connections in the crypto world. And I can speak Mandarin and English and Cantonese. I am also a coder. My time is very casual, right now it is full-time on MoonDAO.\n\nObjective #1: Oversee the application process and the participation at the IAC conference. \nKey Results for Objective #1: Successfully open a MoonDAO bank account\nDeposit $50,000 from Mu ltisig into the account. The deposit is refundable after the period required by the bank.\nSuccessfully complete payments with wire transfer and physical cards\n\nTeam Steward Minimum Viable Payment: 0\n\n\n## Budget Justifications\n\nRefundable deposit for 3 months - 6 months: $50000\nEstimated Physical Cards shipment fees: $80-$100\nLawyer document Fees: $300\n\n## Total Budget (including guaranteed payments to team members): \n$50400 worth of Dai\n0 $MOONEY\n\n\n## Estimated Project Timeline (Table C)\nSeptember 15, 2022: Start taking applications for bank account \nOctober 15, 2022: MoonDAO bank account approved\nOct 20, 2022: E-bank ready to go, we can start to wire online.\nNov 20, 2022: Receive Physical Cards\n\n## Deadline for the project: Nov 25, 2022\n",

      "title": "MDP-30: Guild Guidelines Proposal",
      "content": "## Abstract:\n\nThis project aims to create the Guild Guidelines that determine how a guild is established and intended to work in a transparent and auditable way, guild's scope of work, and how compensation will work for those guilds. \n\n\n## Motivation: \n\nCommunity is the most valuable asset of MoonDAO. Yet, we still lack an efficient system to onboard, educate and enable our talented members to contribute to the development of MoonDAO. \n\nMoonDAO Guilds are talent pools created to address the above problems. Currently, there are a couple of MoonDAO guilds, namely: growth guild, writing guild, development guild. Yet, they have not been operated in a systematic and effective way. There is a lack of clear definition of guild scope of works, guild member right and responsibility, regular activities (e.g. on-boarding, training, bounties, etc.).\n\n\n## Specification: \n\nThis project aims to create the Guild guideline which will help to answer the following questions:\n- What is a Guild?\n- Who can start a Guild?\n- How to start a Guild? \n- What is the Template for Guild Proposal?\n- What are the expectations for Guild Steward & guild members?\n- How do guild steward and members receive rewards for their work?\n- What Guild steward have to do when their Guild Proposal passes?\n- Can a Guild be terminated?\n- How to select Guild members and Guild stewards (when current Guild steward terms end)? \n- How does a Guild apply for a guild budget? \n- How to monitor the health and impact of a guild? \n\nUpon the completion of the guideline, roll out the document through providing multi training sessions, and set an example through establishing a new Guild\n\n\n## Benefits: \n\nSystematic and effective system for on-board, incubate, and enable new contributors to MoonDAO. This is one step closer to a decentralized and autonomous organization. \n\n## Risks: \nThe Guild guideline should be considered as a breathing document which is subject to change overtime. It is acknowledged that the Project team has limited experience running guilds.  Thus the guideline may need to be revised to reflect the best practice over time. \n\n\n## Objectives and Key Results:\n\nObjective #1: Create the Guild guideline \nKey Results for Objective #1: \n- Create EN & CN version of guild guideline that covers all questions in Specification section. \n- Ensure consistency with existing documents (e.g. Constitution, Project Proposal v.3, on-boarding process, etc.) \n\n\nObjective #2: Successfully roll out the Guile guideline \nKey for Objective #2: \n- Get snapshot approval from community\n- Successfully organize training sessions to community\n- Set an example through establishing a new Guild.\n- Support the establishment of at least 2 more Guilds. \n\n## Team Table (Table A)\n\nTeam Stewards: @Luffy @Pablo \nInitial Team: @ballack, @Damian，@Richard\nSponsors: @Barney \nForeign Language Representatives (optional): @Ballack\nMulti-sig Signers (if Budget is needed): NA\n\n\n### Team Steward #1 @Luffy54\n\nBio/background: Luffy MoonDAO core contributors from early stage.

      "title": "MDP-29: MoonDAO a leader at the International Astronautical Federation And Space Arena ",
      "content": "## Abstract\nMoonDAO has earned the respect as a leader in the crypto community and now needs to do the same within the space travel community. This project will focus on obtaining membership for MoonDAO in the International Astronautical Federation (IAF) and establishing a presence at relevant events. This is vital for MoonDAO because the biggest players in the industry (SpaceX, NASA, and major universities) are active participants in this federation. This is the perfect opportunity to attract and recruit engineers and space industry talent and to learn about opportunities to collaborate with some of the largest players. Also, this project seeks to sponsor NewSpace2022, which is a space travel event put on by https://newspace.spacefrontier.org/ \n\n## Motivation\nThe motivation is to establish MoonDAO as a respected leader, resource and inspiration within the space industry. This will attract people that are passionate about our mission of getting to the moon and decentralizing space exploration.\n\n## Specification\nThe first goal is to apply and be accepted as a member of the IAC. This will until gathering the necessary documents and filling out the necessary applications and then providing any further supplementations that may be requested from the IAC. The second goal is to select members from our community to attend Space industry events so that we can network and establish ourselves as a major player within this industry. The third goal is to send members from our community to the largest astronaut conference in the world at the International Astronautical Congress (IAC), which is being held in Paris on September 18-22, 2022. MoonDAO will send five to eight of our members selected by the stewards to this event to represent us and engage with the space travel community. The project will also locate opportunities to promote MoonDAO at this event by sponsoring and providing MoonDAO promotional items.\n\nWith regards to SpaceFrontier conference, Pablo or Favian have been invited to speak in a panel about financing space through blockchain and crypto in Seattle, Washington on September 24-26, 2022. This conference will include speakers from major space companies like Blue Origin and Axiom. The expected audience are space career individuals who would be a perfect fit to join our community.\n\nBenefits: Once we become part of IAC, we will have the benefits of being able to network with people and organizations that are in the space industry and will have direct access to resources that are already out there and that could benefit our community. By sending members of our community to these events, our community will benefit by attracting more space enthusiasts and builders to our community and legitimizing our organization.\nRisks: There is a risk that our application to IAF may be rejected, or that they demand more information. \n\n## Objectives and Key Results:\n \n### Objective #1: To elect and register five members from within our community to send to the International Astronautical Congress.\nKey Results for Objective #1: \n- Create an application for our members to apply\n- Select 5-8 members to attend IAC and Network. Attendees will be expected to connect with 5 people at this event, invite them to our discord/twitter and follow up/onboard after the conference. Attendees will also be expected to submit a report to MoonDAO about the conference and any opportunities that could benefit our community.\n- Register our representatives for the conference and cover travel arrangements\n- Create a networking mission for our representatives to follow\n\n### Objective #2: To establish MoonDAO as a member of the International Astronautical Federation\nKey Results for Objective #2: \n- Prepare all documents necessary to submit the application\n- Submit and pay for application\n\n## Team Table (Table A)\n| Team Leads                                   | Favian and Pablo                           |\n|----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|\n| Initial Team                                 | Favian and Pablo                           |\n| Sponsors                                     | Pablo and Kori                             |\n| Multi-sig Signers (if Budget is needed)      | Favian, Pablo, Larrotiz, Barney, Luffy |\n| Foreign Language Representatives (optional)  | Spanish - Favian, Pablo                    |\n\n\n## Team Leader(s) \n\n### Favian#8760\nBio: Favian is an attorney and key contributor for MoonDAO.

      "title": "MDP-28: MoonDAO Website Improvement Project",
      "content": "## Abstract\n\nThis project will focus on adding new interactive features to our website along with improvements to our documentation and visual appeal. This will be accomplished with various phases or “sub-projects”. The first phase is to create a MoonDAO online store to sell MoonDAO merchandising. Second, will be to implement $MOONEY staking for governance and LP rewards. The third phase will consist of updates to documentation. We will also create a dashboard to display key MoonDAO info. And lastly, we will revamp the landing/homepage with respect to the new additions. \n\n## Motivation/Benefits\nTo create a central place for all information pertinent to MoonDAO, attract new members with an attractive, easy to follow site, and to generate revenue through a store.\n\n## Risks\nThe risks are minimal for this project. The only risk is the loss to the treasury if the project doesn’t get completed, but the budget is already rather small. There is also the risk of tax/legal issues through store sales, but we will ensure we are following all tax guidelines.\n\n## Specification\n\n### 1. MoonDAO Store\n\nMoonDAO currently lacks any sort of revenue stream. A quick and easy way to generate income is to sell MoonDAO merchandising. The plan is to create an online store with print on demand items (shirts, hats, hoodies, etc.) with MoonDAO branding. We may have to consider trademarking the MoonDAO logos if possible to prevent copycat merchandising.\n\nThe first steps will consist of finding a quality POD supplier and ordering samples. Finding a supplier with international shipping will be key in order to accommodate our international community. Next we will set up a Shopify store to handle payments and order fulfillment. The Shopify store will exist as a subdomain (store.moondao.com).\n\nNext steps could be to add items with limited time designs or sell items as one-off physical NFTs.\n\n### 2. Documentation\n\nOnce the constitution is finished and approved by the DAO, our documentation will have to be updated to reflect all the new rules, procedures, values, etc. Much of this work can be outsourced to the writer’s guild with revisions being done by the constitution team and astronauts. \n\n### 3. MoonDAO Dashboard\n\nMuch of MoonDAO’s key information for members is currently scattered throughout different sites, Discord channels, etc. This phase consists of creating a dashboard that stores dynamic information such as events, active proposals, news, and other dynamic pieces of information by request of DAO members.\n\nThe work for this phase will consist of front-end design/implementation and the creation of workflow for contributors to add information to the dashboard. The dashboard and homepage can ideally exist separately in order for the homepage to act more as a landing page for outsiders.\n\n### 4. Landing Page Revamp\n\nThe homepage as it currently stands is basically a landing page for new users. A cooler design with a more visual experience would be ideal. @CompositeFellow, a member of our community, had the idea of making the landing page consist of a tour of MoonDAO's moon base. The goal with this is to attract new people to get involved and present MoonDAO as a more professional entity to the outside world to help with future partnerships and visibility.\n\n\n## Objectives and Key Results:\n### Objective #1: Create a store with high end MoonDAO merchandise.\n- Over 100 unique sales in the first month after launch.\n\n### Objective #2:  Rewrite and create new documentation that is accurate, easy to read, and furthers interest in MoonDAO.\n- Cover 90% of inbound questions from new members in documentation.\n\n### Objective #3:  Create an effective daily dashboard for MoonDAO members.\n- Over 100 average daily visits in the first month after launch.\n\n### Objective #4:  Create a captivating landing page.\n- Over 10% conversion rate of site visits to twitter/discord link clicks for unique, first time visits.\n\n\n\n## Team Table\n| Role                             | Contributor                               |\n|----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|\n| Team Stewards                    | @Larrotiz @Barney                         |\n| Initial Team                     | @pablo                                    |\n|  Sponsors                        | @pablo                                    |\n| Foreign Language Representatives | @Barney                                   |\n| Multi-sig Signers                | @Larrotiz @Barney @pablo @favian @ballack |\n \n\n## Team stewards Bio\n### Larrotiz\nBio/background: Larrotiz has recently graduated from the University of Michigan with a degree in computer science.

      "title": "MDP-27: Open Lunar #fundafellow Sponsorship Proposal",
      "content": "## Abstract \n\nOur friends at Open Lunar Foundation are fundraising for their research program and we have been invited to contribute as a sponsor of a researcher (or multiple). \n\nWe have previously engaged with Open Lunar to discuss governance systems for the Moon, and use their insights on the governance of MoonDAO itself. Their research fellowship program advances proposed solutions for challenges involved in living and working on the Moon, has a strong track record and as we speak they’re shortlisting from more than 75 applicants for their next round. A handful of other organizations are sponsoring a fellow through the #fundafellow campaign and we could too, and in doing so put ourselves on the map in the lunar ecosystem. \n\nCase studies, stories from fellows, videos about the work, links to prior published research and more is available here: www.openlunar.org/fellow\n\n## Specification\n\nThis proposal will support Moon Phase 3 (Provide funding to space research and exploration) part of our Roadmap to the Moon. The objective would be to collaborate with Open Lunar by funding their research fellowship program. For background, Open Lunar is a 501c3 nonprofit in California, catalyzing an open, cooperative, long term lunar future. They address risks of monopoly, facilitate international cooperation, and incentivise governance systems to ensure we put humanity’s best foot forward on the Moon. Open Lunar works at the intersections of policy and technology, and puts policy into action in order to set precedents. More here: openlunar.org.\n\nThis proposal aims at deciding whether we would support the Open Lunar fellowship program and what level of support we can provide. \n\nThe support tiers are classified as:\n  \n### Sponsor a Fellow\n$5,000\n+ Invite only access to an AMA with astronaut Chris Hadfield about the future of the Moon\n+ An advisory relationship with a research fellow\n+ Access to behind the scenes new research and events with Fellows\n\n### Cohort Champion\n$25,000\n+ Joining Open Lunar donor circle called the Zenith Group which participates in strategic updates across all of Open Lunar’s work, VIP event access and private discussions about the sector.\n\nOpen Lunar provides wraparound support with research supervision, coaching and development, group collaboration sessions, showcase events for presenting findings and more. This is all factored into their existing costs, so our contribution is contributed directly to stipends to enable fellows to access the opportunity.\n\nThis contribution would result in a long-term relationship with Open Lunar. As #fundafellow sponsors, we will be invited to: \n\n+ Tell Open Lunar what topics or key issues for lunar development MoonDAO is interested in so they can factor that into selection of fellows.\n\n+ Nominate additional possible fellows from our network whom we’d like to see shortlisted in the selection process.\n\n+ Work with Open Lunar to do marketing around our sponsorship story as a leading sponsor of their research as a cohort champion, or be connected specifically with one fellow who fits our interest set, for both storytelling and research relationship. \n\n## Vote\n\nTheir next intake of researchers is happening in August, so we need to decide by Sunday August 15th about our support. If you have questions you can DM Chelsea#6740 in Discord from their team, or email c@openlunar.org\n",

      "title": "MDP-26: Project Proposal Process Update (v3)",
      "content": "## Abstract\nAfter graduating our first class of MoonDAO projects we have learned a lot, and have implemented some of the feedback into the new iteration of MoonDAO project process. Included in this update are proposed changes to incentives for project members, a new review process for projects after they're completed, and an updated project proposal template.\n\n## Motivation\nPreviously, each Project Steward received an equal $5,000 monthly payment for stewarding a project. This ended up being problematic because some projects were really large and required a lot of work, while others were smaller in scope. There was also disagreement about whether projects were actually completed successfully, and we didn't have a method to objectively determine whether the projects were successful.\n\n## Specification\nThere are three major updates to the project system that are highlighted in yellow in the document attached below. For convenience, here is a summary of each change:\n\n1. Every member on a MoonDAO project can suggest a \"Minimum Viable Payment\" for completing their OKR. This is a guaranteed payment, but it is only a portion of the total -- since Dai and $MOONEY rewards will be done by the community after each payment period is over. Some stewards may elect to take no minimum viable payment, and others that are devoting a lot of work may elect to ask for some. The amount may vary depending on the scope of the project, and it's up to the community to decide if the amount being requested is reasonable. The payment is executed once the project is completed.\n\n2. After the project is completed, if there is a disagreement about a project OKR being completed successfully, seven MoonDAO guild members will be selected at random and they will vote on whether they believe the OKR was completed.\n\n3. The Project Proposal template was edited to include more information like motivation, benefits, drawbacks, a total budget section, and a deadline for the project.\n\nYou can read the entire Project Proposal process v3 here, with the edits highlighted in yellow:\n\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1zXXoi5yTnsnFFOYgY5UMFb7W8l3mSzcXFPr6Amb3YZY/edit#\n\nFor reference, here is the project proposal process v2:\n\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1t8WEfzA9EO0GCUX6Rvu2UG7m6qvMd6Wdwd5CikHOhlo/edit#\n\n## Benefits\nProject steward payment will more accurately reflect the amount of work done, and the community has a process for raising concerns if they believe that a project has not properly completed its OKRs. Also, the new template breaks down information about project proposals into new categories that make it easier for someone to make a decisions about whether the project is useful to the DAO or not.\n\n## Risks\nWe are iterating on project proposal systems as we go at MoonDAO. Every new policy change may have unforeseen edge cases or consequences. As a result of these policy changes, some very honest conversations will need to be had about salary expectations up front within the team and at project reviews, and this could create disagreements between members. Also, the OKR review process by seven guild members could create tension and hurt relationships between DAO members if there's a disagreement about whether work was done successfully.\n\n## Vote\nA 70% \"Yes\" vote is required for updating the project system.",

Using this legal entity to conduct our sweepstakes will provide maximum legal security to MoonDAO and its key contributors instead of assigning the full responsibility and liability on Kori. We have Bay0 and Barney0 full passport information and address (also Pablo lives right next to them) so this process is as operationally and legally secure as we could do within reason. Attached are the full details of the Macau entity we have done the deal with. The novation of the contract was supported and voted on in MDP-5.\n\nYes: Support Novation. \nNo: No Novation. \n![Screenshot 2022-05-26 at 16.11.31.png](ipfs://QmQ8jQo5Z2U4ZvMVEiLegPEoYwsJDhDEKTRNU7d2SVb3au)",

      "title": " MDP-14: Reimbursements and External Payments (11/24/2021-3/25/2022)",
      "content": "Many members of our DAO have gone forward and made payments on behalf of MoonDAO without guarantee that they would get reimbursed. This involved payments like setting up the gnosis safe, the juicebox, or other key expenses necessary to make the DAO function.\n\nSince we did not vote on a policy for reimbursements until this moment, we are going to individually vote on each payment made on behalf of the DAO. It is each member's responsibility to go through each transaction and determine if they believe that it should be reimbursed.\n\nFrom prior discussions with members of the DAO, we have determined that there are three valid forms of reimbursement in the sheet: \n- Payments that were required in FIAT (and passed on Snapshot), hence off-ramp payments had to be made by an individual. \n- Crypto payments that had been passed by Snapshot, but for whatever reason had not been deployed from our multi-sig and was instead paid by an individual \n- Payments that were made by a contributor, at their own discretion, without being passed by Snapshot, for the sake of expediency. \n\nIt is up to the voter’s judgment whether payments of this nature ought to be reimbursed.\n\nLinked below is the sheet with all requested reimbursement requests. Each reimbursement request has the following fields:\n- Approved from Prior Snapshot \n- Discord id of individual requesting reimbursement \n- Payment Recipient\n- Txn Receipt\n- Payment Amount and Currency \n- Text field describing Justification/Gain to MoonDAO\n\nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1aNHMQus8T4YPDjjvuxOmFflhMZ-CiyMlA2-_k5jdNC4/edit?usp=sharing\n\nThe community will vote on each reimbursement request a ‘yes’ or a ‘no’. The vote number corresponds to the request count on the sheet linked above. Reimbursements will then be made with Utopia. \n\nNote: If passed, $MOONEY reimbursements will be the amount of $MOONEY corresponding to the ETH value at the time of transaction.",

      "title": "MDP-13: Revised Retroactive Governance Token Allocation For Phase 1",
      "content": "## Context\nThis is a revised snapshot proposal to determine the final % of governance tokens allocated to the team for Phase 1 work, and to agree on a final plan for governance token allocation based on many meetings with the community.\n\nThe only difference between this proposal and MDP-13 is the vesting schedule of the tokens. See the Vesting section for more details.\n\nPhase 1 is defined as the work involved in going from 0 to 1 with MoonDAO. Creating the vision, goals, mission, values, marketing the project, putting up the juicebox raise and launching the token to our eventual $8.3 million dollar raise from the community. This pay period is between November 24th, 2021 and January 17th 2022.\n\nThroughout MoonDAO, no one on the team has taken a payment so far. The founding team did not take a pre-token allocation, and we have been coming up with a fair proposal such that everyone who did work during the Phase 1 period can receive $MOONEY for their efforts.\n\n## Methodology for Compensation\nIn MDP-2 we put up a Snapshot vote to get a distribution of what the community feels is the appropriate amount to distribute to the people who worked in that pay period. The vote was to determine the % of $MOONEY in our treasury that will be distributed to people, the results were as follows:\n\nMean: 12.230%, 160,087,373 $MOONEY\nMean-Median Average: 8.615%, 112,768,007 $MOONEY\nMedian: 5.000%, 65,448,640 $MOONEY\n\nWe will vote between these three options using token weighting.\n\nWe have also set up a Coordinape with all the active Phase 1 contributors, where each contributor for that pay period had tokens they could gift out to others, the distribution is included here:\n\nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1IlHGA-8AxWzPBWN2gWkm0AyYX9UdLdLponeDQXnK4Us/edit#gid=2010701096\n\n## Vesting\nOn May 1st 20% of the tokens will vest immediately, then the rest will vest equally on the first of every month until November. In other words the vesting schedule will look like this:\n\nMay 1st: 20.000%\nJune 1st: 13.333%\nJuly 1st: 13.333%\nAugust 1st: 13.333%\nSeptember 1st: 13.333%\nOctober 1st: 13.333%\nNovember 1st: 13.335%\n\nNote that November 1st has slightly more to make the total sum equal to 100% of the tokens.\n\n## Stable Token Split\nWe will allow contributors to take 25% of their governance tokens in Dai rather than $MOONEY, with a total of up to $10,000.\n\nWith a default value of 0% tokens in stables unless we are notified otherwise.\n\n$MOONEY to Dai conversion will be priced on a seven day trailing average from the point at which it is dispersed.\n\n## Voting Options\nWe will use a token weighted average between the three statistics from MDP-2. In other words if 50% of the tokens are at 5%, and 50% were at 10% then the result would be 7.5%.\n\nYou may also chose to vote \"No\" which means you do not agree to pay the members using this methodology. If \"No\" votes are over 50% then we will delay governance token allocations and use a different methodology.",

(If there are Chinese members proposal it on Discord we won’t collect that)\nHave discussion in proposal group.\nAggregate suggestions and finish the proposal draft.\nTranslate and check the final edition of proposal draft.\nWe adopt the practice of unified release of our final edition by core contributor from Chinese community @Richard, to increasing efficiency.\n\n**Profile**\nWe want to develop a website called “Space Postcards” with a simple purpose:\n\n1 - Allowing everyone to upload pictures, text, etc. that are meaningful to them,\n2 - Allowing everyone to thumb up and vote for their favorite contents,\n3 - Sending them to the moon.\n\nImagine how cool it would be if you were a basketball fan and you could send a classic Michael Jordan scene to the moon and it might get a thumbs up from Jordan himself! If you are a science fan, you can send “E=MC²” to the moon, which is a very meaningful thing!\n\nIn the future, we will establish the website to be a Web 3 platform or space enthusiast forum with space knowledge popularization, tips, etc.\n\n**Vision**\nBy establishing this website, I am proposing to achieve following effects(if everything goes well):\n\n1 - To spread MoonDAO project well-known all over the world. Like mentioned examples of basketball and science. Imagine what a huge global hype we will create if different people from various fields want their works showing up to the moon and they will canvass everywhere, which is a good publicity for us! At that time, people might not have ever heard about Bitcoin, they will definitely know about MoonDAO! The more people know about us, the more successful we will achieve!\n\n(This holder restriction is because we need want celebrities hold our token to enhance our exposure. Maybe Jaychou’s fans vote for Jaychou and then Jaychou will be picked.)\n\n2 - These following planned features can strongly enhance the Moondao community consensus and increase the practical application of our governance token $mooney.\n(1) If the chosen content owner was a long term holder or pledger of $mooney, we can mint NFT of his work as a reward.\n(2) Increasing vote ratio of $mooney holders in order to booting the sense of mission of every member and attracting more people with space dream to join us!\n(3) If want the celebrities hold the token to make some news, we can lower threshold, no need let them hold for a long term or lock up. Such as the TOP10 finalists could just have bought token but they can sell it whenever they want, TOP 10-20 need to hold token for some time.\n\n**Basic Function**\n1 - Login ( Supporting web3 wallet, email, username, twitter, google etc)\n2 - Content Upload. (To ensure quality, the limit of upload number is one for every account)\n3 - Research & Review\n4 - Detail Reviewing\n5 - Vote & Like\n6 - Comment\n\n**Concept map (see Discourse for image)**\n\n1 - Jan-Feb 2022 : Version 1.0 with basic functions launched.\n2 - Apr-Launching to the moon 2022: High quality content selection and Version 2.0 development.\n3 - Landing on the Moon!\n4 - After moon landing: Continuous marketing to enhance our IP. Make this website a web3 space theme platform or space enthusiast forum.\n\n**Cautions**\nIn order to avoid unnecessary arguments, any contents related to pornography, violence, religion, politics, etc will be rejected.\n\n**Development Team**\nSince the main core team needs to focus on the development of “Ticket to Space\" project”, as our main task, also considering the differences of time zone and work habits between Chinese and foreign teams, I recommended that the Chinese community development team undertakes the initial development of this project. After the main core team’s key work completion, we will develop together.\n\nA vote for \"Yes\" means that the DAO can use its resources to support this mission! A vote for \"No\" means that the DAO will not support this project.",

      "content": "Discourse: https://discourse.moondao.com/t/daodenver-february-15-16/34/11\n\nTranslation: https://moondao.notion.site/DAODenver-CN-version-DAODenver-February-15-16-da0a98d33ebe4a4d83065ed927fd02a8\n\nDAODenver is happening next week and we have been offered the opportunity to have a presence and use the DAODenver event as a platform for introducing the wider DAO and crypto community to MoonDAO. The objective would be for this event to result in better understanding of what MoonDAO is all about, and hopefully result in a net gain in terms its PR investment value. This sponsorship package includes:\n\n- A MoonDAO lunar new year celebration party on the full moon of 2/15.\n- VIP access to $MOONEY holders to the \"Skybox\" lounge throughout the 2-day event (a 1100 square foot space with a private bar that overlooks the entire event, planned to turn into a lounge for speakers, sponsors, and VIP ticket holders).\n- Livestreamed/recorded DAO speaking panels.\n- Livestreamed/recorded fireside chat about MoonDAO.\n- The opportunity to make a big marketing announcement for our TicketToSpace NFTs (potentially including a whitelist). We will work with our marketing team to make the most of our marketing communication at DAODenver.\n- Known as helping make DAODenver free for the wider DAO community.\n\nThis proposal includes two decisions:\n#1. A MoonDAO sponsorship of DAODenver.\n#2. Sending MoonDAO members to DAODenver and paying for their expenses (flight, lodging, per diem for food, incidentals, etc.)\n\n#1. Sponsoring DAODenver Details\nIn the effort to make DAODenver free for everyone, DAOPlanet have created a juicebox project: https://juicebox.money/#/p/daodenver\n\nWe have reached an agreement with DAOPlanet to do a treasury swap where:\n1. MoonDAO will contribute $25k of ETH to their juicebox in exchange for DAOPlanet's governance tokens.\n2. If DAOPlanet achieves their goal of raising $250,000 they will make their event free to all participants (or subsidize costs to the fullest extent possible). \n3. If DAOPlanet raises past $300,000 they will purchase $25k of $MOONEY from an AMM. \n4. If DAOPlanet does not achieve their goal of raising $300,000, DAOPlanet will purchase $MOONEY on an AMM equivalent to the overflow profit of the event, divided by 50%, up to the full $25k.\nThis means that we will have a treasury swap in our respective governance tokens, meaning that we are incentive aligned in the future.\n\n**#2. Sending MoonDAO members to DAODenver details**\nAny MoonSettler, Rocketeer, or Astronaut can ask to have their expenses paid for by the DAO for participating/attending DAODenver.\n\nThe maximum budget allowed will be $600 for flights, $200/night (max 3 nights) for lodging, and $100 per-diem for food and other incidentals (max 3 days). The expenses past that will be covered on your own dime. Members will be reimbursed for their expenses after DAODenver.\n\nThis is a maximum expense of $1500 per person the DAO sends to DAODenver.",

      "content": "Discourse link: https://discourse.moondao.com/t/mdp-2-retroactive-compensation-for-phase-1/53/7\n\nAs discussed above, this vote is to determine the amount of $MOONEY from MoonDAO’s treasury that will be used to retroactively compensate MoonDAO contributors that worked on setting up the DAO from its inception on November 24th 2021, to the end of the token sale on January 16th 2022.\n\nThis first vote will act as a temperature check to serve as a signal from the community as to what the preferences are of the $MOONEY holders. Once the signal is captured, we will put up a second “final allocation vote” with the options for total $MOONEY to be distributed for Phase 1 work.\n\nOur treasury has approximately 1.3 billion $MOONEY and the percentage chosen will be the percent of that $MOONEY treasury that will be distributed to contributors. Therefore, choosing 100% = 1.3 billion $MOONEY, choosing 0% corresponds to 0 $MOONEY.\n\nThe details of how we will distribute the $MOONEY are discussed on the above Discourse, we will use a system where contributors will receive points that they can allocate to anyone else but not themselves, this way the contributors can collectively determine the amount of compensation that will go to any individual.\n\nThe details of this system are included in the Discourse above and will be subject to another vote by the community to confirm that this system is acceptable to the community.\n\nFor this proposal we will use Weighted Voting and you can choose any number of options with your tokens. The distribution provided is made up of 5% increments, so if for example you wanted to vote for a value in between the increments you can do so by putting a portion of your tokens on one choice, and a portion on a another choice, and the average of your weighted token votes will be your decided amount.\n\nAgain, this vote is just to capture the sentiments of the community and we will then put up a second vote for the final allocation. As a reminder we will use a 4% hard cap of the circulating $MOONEY supply on any vote, meaning that no individual should use more than 50,000,000 $MOONEY tokens on a single vote.\n\nThank you for contributing to MoonDAOs governance!",

      "title": "Phase 2 Budget Proposal",
      "content": "MoonDAO's goal in 2022 is to launch one or more MoonDAO members into space. To achieve this goal we are moving part of our treasury to a stable coin pegged to the US Dollar (Dai) to protect us against volatility in the ETH-USD markets, and we will use this allocation to execute on our Phase 2 mission.\n\nSome of our partners with this mission may require payment in fiat. Before any funds are moved into a fiat account, the community will vote again to ensure that the proper protections are placed on the fiat account we use that is inline with MoonDAO's values of transparency and decentralization, without disclosing any of our partner's sensitive information. If approved, we will move this allocation into a fiat account that can be used to purchase the tickets to space and cover other associated costs.\n\nThese costs include, but are not limited to, purchasing the tickets from a company capable of sending our members to space, taxes, legal fees, insurance, lodging and training for chosen members and their chosen support team, and even, potentially, a party for MoonDAO members to celebrate achieving our Phase 2 goal.\n\nThe budget total represents the *permissible spending limit* by the DAO to achieve our Phase 2 mission. In other words, we will continue to operate in a frugal manner so that the overflow (the amount we end up not needing) can be returned to the Gnosis multi-signature treasury at the end of our Phase 2 mission.\n\nThat being said, we reserve the right to put out another budget proposal to the community if there are unexpected expenses (e.g. extra insurance, taxes, legal fees). We don't think this will be the case, but there are always unknown unknowns.\n\nDepending on the total budget chosen we will be able to purchase more or less tickets to space. A higher budget means multiple people can go to space, and we can potentially use a different NFT/MOONEY election mechanisms for each ticket. We can also spend more on outreach and design, have a bigger MoonDAO party, and even host our first podcast in space ;)\n\nYou may vote for more than one option proportional to the amount of tokens that you have. Please do not use more than 100,000,000 $MOONEY to vote (this corresponds to approximately 4% of the total $MOONEY supply). We will run through the snapshot vote and remove votes for addresses that do this.\n\nThe voting will be open for three days. Once the voting closes we will put in a transaction on our multi-sig to move the funds to Dai.\n\nThank you for being a part of our first MoonDAO proposal! We are one step closer to having a DAO colony on the moon!",
