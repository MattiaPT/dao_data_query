      "content": "## TL;DR\n\nPrevious proposal have been brought up to the Bancor DAO that set a 0.001% (1/10th of a basis point) fee on stable to stable trades for certain trading pairs.\n\nThis proposal is looking to expand on these previous proposals by setting a lower fee on the USDC-USDT trading pair on the Carbon DeFi deployment on Sei v2.\n\n## Overview:\n\nThe default taker fee on Carbon DeFi for Ethereum is 0.2% and 0.4% on the Sei v2 deployment. This means that anyone taking an order from the protocol has to pay this amount. Previous proposals:\n\nhttps://gov.bancor.network/t/proposal-expand-custom-taker-fee-on-stable-to-stable-trades/4540\nhttps://gov.bancor.network/t/custom-taker-fee-on-stable-to-stable-trades/4370\n\nhave been brought up to the Bancor DAO to lower this fee to 0.001% on stable to stable trades for certain trading pairs in order to make Carbon DeFi more competitive with stable to stable swaps that are normally lower across all DEXs (e.g. On uniswap v3, stable to stable trading pairs are typically set to 1 basis point).\n\nThis proposal is seeking to expand the custom taker fee to the USDT-USDC trading pair on Sei v2. Specifically, these two tokens:\n\nhttps://seitrace.com/token/0x3894085Ef7Ff0f0aeDf52E2A2704928d1Ec074F1?chain=pacific-1\n\nhttps://seitrace.com/token/0xB75D0B03c06A926e488e2659DF1A861F860bD3d1?chain=pacific-1\n\nWhy these two tokens? This USDC is minted on noble (https://www.circle.com/en/multi-chain-usdc/noble) which is an app chain on Cosmos that is specifically built for USDC (i.e. this is the canonical USDC on Sei v2). The USDT is minted on KAVA which is a Cosmos chain that has native USDT (also the canonical USDT on Sei v2).\n\n**FOR**: Update the taker fee to .001% on the USDC-USDT trading pair on Sei v2\n\n**AGAINST**: Take no Action",

Deploy a [vortex](https://vote.bancor.network/#/proposal/0x82b918fd7d51809102bb0c3620ce22959e49b5ccdf29228da42360e48edadd46) alongside each Carbon and/or Fastlane deployment.\n\n  a. Does not matter if the deployment is licensed or not\n\n2. That vortex will allow the vault to sell its TKN for a final target token.\n\n# Final Target Token\n\nThe goal of choosing a final target token is to ensure the fees are all in one token thereby reducing the cost of sending to the Carbon Vortex on Ethereum. The process of sending to Ethereum will be outlined in a future proposal.\n\nCareful consideration should be given to choosing the final target token.\n\nFirst Choice\n\n* ETH\n\nETH is chosen as it can be bridged to the mainnet and has deep liquidity.\n\nSecond Choice\n\n* WETH\n* To be used if it is not possible to set ETH as the final target token\n\nThird Choice\n\n* Gas token of the chain\n* To be used if it is not possible to set ETH or WETH as the final target token\n* The gas token is only an option if it has liquidity on Ethereum mainnet. Otherwise, it can be bridged to the Ethereum Carbon Vortex but not ever sold if there is no liquidity.\n\nFourth Choice\n\n* If none of these is possible, a proposal should be made.\n\n# Parameters\n\nThe goal here is to define the correct parameters that will work with most chains without the DAO being required to vote on parameters for each.\n\n**Define target token**: (Gas Token of the Chain)\n\n**Define final target token**: See section above\n\n**Define Caller Incentive:** 0.1% (this represents a reduction from current incentives)\n\n**Define Half Life:** 12 hours\n\n# Flow\n\n* Users can call a public function that does the following:\n  * Enable a TKN to Target Token trading\n  * Withdraws accumulated TKN from the Arb Bot Vault\n  * Caller gets 0.1% of TKN transferred amount (caller incentive)\n* TKN is put up for sale at an arbitrarily high price with exponential decay and defined half life.\n* To prevent abuse, calling this function will reset the auction price if over half of the TKN has been sold already\n* Users can call the public function to trade TKN for target token at any time or price point.\n* If the target token is not the final target token, it is put up for sale for the final target token at an arbitrarily high price with exponential decay and half life of 12 hours.\n  * Similar to the POL contract, this can be triggered with a bucket system ([LINK](https://gov.bancor.network/t/proposal-to-use-pol-to-reduce-b3-deficits/4502/5))\n\n# FOR\n\nDeploy the Arb Fast Lane and the Fast Lane Vault Vortex on every chain where there is a recognized Carbon deployment.\n\n# AGAINST\n\nDo nothing.",

While the author of this proposal would like to have something similar to what was done on mainnet ([link](https://vote.bancor.network/#/proposal/0xcafe6326cfc8003ed379b1a77c50644825e334476b4db21feb60bf4ef65287fb)), it might make more sense to see which stables people are interested in using and then creating the special fee tier.\n\n# FOR\n\nDeploy on SEI V2 with a taker fee of 40 BP\n\n# AGAINST\n\nTake no action",

The goal is to take fees earned and convert them to BNT via ETH and send that BNT to the token contract.\n\n# Description:\n\nParameters:\n\n* Define target token: **ETH**\n* Define final target token: **BNT**\n* Define MaxSaleAmount: **100**\n* Define MinSaleAmount: **10**\n* Define Caller Incentive: **0.5%** (this represents a reduction from current incentives)\n* Define Half Life: **12 hours**\n\nNote: ETH is proposed as it is the most common pairing of tokens on Ethereum mainnet. This should ensure mostly simple trading pairs without the need for complex arb routes.\n\nFlow:\n\nNote: For simplicity, I will describe the flow using the above parameters\n\n* The CarbonController and Carbon Vortex/Vault hold all fees generated from Carbon and the Arb Bot on Ethereum.\n  * Note: In the future, I plan to propose a mechanism for sending TKN from the arb bot vaults on other chains to the Carbon Vortex.\n* Users can call a public function to enable TKN to ETH trading\n  * Withdraws accumulated fees (CarbonController + TKN in vortex/vault)\n  * Caller gets 0.5% of TKN transferred amount (caller incentive)\n  * TKN is put up for sale at an arbitrarily high price with exponential decay and half life of 12 hours.\n  * To prevent abuse, calling this function will reset the auction price if over half of the TKN has been sold already\n  * Users can call the public function to trade TKN for ETH at any time or price point.\n* If BNT is defined as the final target token, ETH is put up for sale for BNT at an arbitrarily high price with exponential decay and half life of 12 hours.\n  * Similar to the POL contract, this can be triggered with a bucket system ([LINK](https://gov.bancor.network/t/proposal-to-use-pol-to-reduce-b3-deficits/4502/5))\n  * These are defined as MaxSaleAmount and MinSaleAmount\n* BNT received is sent to the token contract.\n\n# For:\n\nUpdate to Vortex 2.0 as outlined above\n\n# Against:\n\nTake no action",

The initial sell price should be set at two times the BNT/ETH rate on CoinGecko. At the time of writing, the rate is about 1 ETH to 3,000 BNT and the contract offers to sell ETH at that initial sell price.\n\n1) Create a public function anyone can call that will put 100 ETH up for sale (100 ETH is a DAO controlled parameter).\n2) The initial sell price should be set at two times the BNT/ETH rate on CoinGecko (this is a DAO controlled parameter).\n3) Contract offers to sell ETH at initial sell price. For example, there are 100 ETH and initial sell per ETH is 6,000 BNT then any user can send 600,000 BNT to acquire the ETH. After the ETH is offered for BNT, the price of ETH drops as defined by an exponential decay formula with a 10 day half life and anyone can buy the ETH with BNT at any time. These BNT are sent to the token contract. These parameters can be adjusted by the DAO.\n4) Once a trade ends and there are less than 10 ETH available for sale, the contract is topped up to 100 ETH. The new initial sell price will be double the price of the last ETH sold.\n\nA visual example of such behavior is shown below.\n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreicp72kzqzw6mu7gxq2seje5n7mdmpbztj3cgeix6cb2fxy2djvmj4)\n\n![image](ipfs://bafkreid4xmqatb7ntvtegvkvpsutw7zutjtpqa4gapbfbohphijm363lqi)\n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreie4qs52n7nvcsmjfedn2urwbxh2iq43ijin6x7zsqkqm2fg2olsju)\n\n![image](ipfs://bafybeia6xjejbktwh6x5difvdqbxchw6dz2fxvydhlcxlubf2sxyv7ymva)\n     \n![image](ipfs://bafkreihhhhagqtq26oe55gfydwr3c7m65u32f55kpnvtub55kmhpg7c4be)\n\n![image](ipfs://bafkreidsnepldnt3tlfgfktabhooyqwlxvyboxhy27svawh5v2cxqlxm7u)\n    \n![image](ipfs://bafkreicfx4zxx2wymoxr35ewrhgj6vfnzc5yjau6ssgdyyubum2byhzuk4)\n     \n![image](ipfs://bafkreifteiyn45udi52de4lzdohzo7swht3eqczvg23lu6hyg2qt6e4jfu)\n     \n![image](ipfs://bafkreibvv2fmmu33naffhur4toquo3eppobho4vile3tlwnj7mk7yr3xgi)\n     \n![image](ipfs://bafkreihtqbijvd5coshisuf2cg57li42xprwbchr2skb72isunrw2mfrgi)\n     \n![image](ipfs://bafkreiayd7fqn5mioe4ukiqon7zlhoy3xpurszpblqwfcfr4gui7dtsydi)\n     \n![image](ipfs://bafkreigfqtk5eo5zlsciniperfgyyevcqfsx7qa6c5gxn6scwvne66e6by)\n    \nFOR\nUse POL to Reduce B3 Deficits as outlined above\n\nAGAINST\nTake no action",

While possible, it seems a much simpler/cleaner/safer implementation is possible that will reduce:\n  * Value leakage\n  * Attack surface area\n  * Complexity\n* The new method will, in brief, start with a price from CoinGecko, multiply it by 2 (starting price) and then reduce the price based on an exponential decay formula until a taker buys TKN with ETH.\n\n# Summary of Flow\n\nThis essentially creates a reverse auction where prices start above market price and gradually fall until TKN is purchased.\n\n* Create Carbon POL contract\n* Expose a public function to withdraw surplus tokens\n  * If the pool has trading liquidity of 0 & vault balance is greater than staking balance, anyone can call a function to move surplus TKN from B3 to the Carbon POL contract\n  * Callers get an incentive of 0.2% of the TKN to call the function\n  * 99.8% of the TKN goes to Carbon POL contract\n* Determine the prices in ETH for each token\n  * Get price from Coingecko\n  * Multiply price by 2 to get initial sell price\n  * Contract offers to sell token at initial sell price for ETH\n    * For example, there are 100 TKN and oracle/CoinGecko price per TKN is 0.1 ETH.\n    * Initial price set at 0.2 ETH per TKN\n    * Any user can send 20 ETH to acquire the 100 TKN\n    * The price of TKN drops as defined by an exponential decay formula with a 10 day half life.\n    * Anyone can buy the TKN with ETH at any time.\n    * These parameters can be adjusted by the DAO\n\n# Note\n\n* There is no more min return as this is no longer traded on a DEX\n  * This solves many of the risks noted above regarding oracle manipulation, slippage and some MEV attacks.\n* These TKN are for sale only onchain, there is no UI for this (as there is no mechanism to slowly and programmatically decrease prices in Carbon).\n* The contract will have a function to see the expected return price.\n* The takers are expected to be arb bots or traders interested in buying tokens at a discount.\n* As an additional layer of protection, this proposal sets a prerequisite that no tokens have their initial price set until the public open source [arb bot](https://github.com/bancorprotocol/fastlane-bot) supports this process and can be a taker.\n  * Of course the bot can only be a taker if there is liquidity on integrated exchanges on Ethereum.\n\n# For\n\nUpdate to POL migration and conversion to ETH method as detailed above with arb bot support as a prerequisite.\n\n# Against\n\nTake no action",

      "content": "# TL;DR\n\n* Carbon has a protocol wide fee of 20 BP (basis points).\n* This fee, while appropriate for volatile pairs - is not in line with the market when it comes to stable to stable trades.\n* For reference, Uniswap added a 1 BP fee option (0.01%) - in November 2021 ([link](https://docs.uniswap.org/concepts/protocol/fees))\n* This proposal seeks to take this one step further and introduce a fee of 0.001% on stable to stable trades. This is 1/10th of a single basis point.\n\n# Summary\n\n* A new function in the contracts will allow the DAO to identify stable pairs that should have a fee that overrides the default fee (20BP) on a given pair.\n  * The initial list is further down in this proposal.\n* A new function in the contracts will allow anyone to query the fee on any pair.\n\n# Supporting Data\n\n* The current fee on stable to stable pairs in 20x that of uniswap\n* There are multiple stable to stable pairs on Carbon and they are not being interacted with frequently or at all.\n\n# Initial List of Stable Pairs to be Updated with 1/10th BP fee\n\n* USDC/USDT\n* USDC/DAI\n* USDC/FRAX\n* USDC/LUSD\n* USDT/DAI\n\n*Note: In order to be included in the list above, a stable pair needs to exist on Carbon. If I missed any, or you would like to add one (and the pair exists on Carbon), tell me in the comments.  As time goes by, the Bancor DAO can add more stable to stable pairs to this list (the contracts cannot autonomously determine which tokens are stable).\n\n\n# Implications\n\n* Gas for takers on these pairs will not change\n* Gas for takers on all other pairs will rise by ~2300 (a couple cents at today’s rates)\n\nFOR: Update the taker fee to 1/10th of a single basis point for the stable pairs listed above\n\nAGAINST: Take no Action",

Carbon fees (vortex)\n\nThe CarbonVortex can access any collected fees that are available in the CarbonController in a given token.\n\n2. CarbonVortex’s own balances\n\nFastlane arb transactions will result in sending the protocol portion to the CarbonVortex contract. These fees will be available for the CarbonVortex to interact with.\n\n### Public write function\n\nCarbonVortex will expose a public write function that can be called by anyone.\n\nFunction execute()\n\nWhen calling the function:\n\n1. Caller needs to pass token address it would like to burn (it can be a list of tokens)\n2. The function will access token fees collected on CarbonController AND CarbonVortex balance\n3. The function will trade a portion (currently defined as 98%) of the token to BNT using Bancor v3 pool\n4. Caller receive the public incentive (currently set at 2%) at the end of the transaction in TKN\n\n### Public read functions\n\nUsers can find the available fee amounts in few places\n\n1. CarbonController, function accumulatedFees(token) will return the available fees collected on Carbon for the specified token\n2. CarbonVortex balance of the token\n3. CarbonVortex, function availableFees(token) will return the sum of available fees collected in both CarbonController and CarbonVortex.\n\n# Next Steps\n\nIf this proposal passes, we should expect a second version that will also know how to handle tokens that do not have liquidity on Bancor 3.\n\n# FOR \n\nUpdate the Carbon Vortex as detailed above.\n\n# AGAINST \n\nTake no action.",

      "content": "# TL;DR\n\n* The Fastlane was originally proposed here:\n  * https://gov.bancor.network/t/proposal-improved-value-capture-and-fast-lane-poc/4142\n  * There have been some additional parameter changes since then.\n* This proposal suggests a redesign of the Fastlane smart contract to help it function more efficiently\n  * Lowering the required gas should enable more arb opportunities\n* The proposed changes\n  * Support flashloans in any token\n  * Support multiple flashloans in a single transaction\n  * Send half the TKN to the caller and half to the Carbon vortex\n    * As opposed to the old design of converting TKN to BNT, sending half to the caller and half to the token contract.\n\n# Impact of Changes\n\n* Support flashloans in any token\n  * Should lower the costs to get some TKNs and increase arb opportunities\n* Support multiple flashloans in a single transaction\n  * Should provide the contract with additional flexibility to capture more arbs\n* Send half the TKN to the caller and half to the Carbon vortex\n  * This solves multiple problems (including how to calculate how much BNT to send to the caller if we are taking loans in multiple tokens), but most importantly, gas savings.\n* No more BNT cap for fastlane callers\n  * As the caller gets rewarded in TKN not BNT\n\n### How can gas costs be reduced?\n\nTwo expensive transactions will be removed from the contract and replaced with cheaper actions.\n\nUpdated flow:\n\n1. Take a flashloan in any token\n2. Trade to close some arb opportunity\n3. Repay flashloan\n4. Send the relevant portion of tokens to CarbonVortexcontract\n5. Send the rest to the caller\n\nBy removing the requirement to trade the tokens to BNT and burn them, and replace them with a transfer, the estimated gas reduction is in the range of 250k per loan (trade is approx. 250k-300k while a transfer is approx. 40k-50k).\n\n# Implications\n\n* The Fastlane will no longer be burning BNT directly.\n* Instead, it will arb and send fees to the CarbonVortex contract (For much less gas)\n  * It will send the TKN gains from arbing to the CarbonVortex contract\n  * The CarbonVortex contract has a public function anyone can call to convert Carbon fees in the form of TKN to BNT and burn it: https://docs.carbondefi.xyz/developer-guides/fee-burner\n  * Should this proposal pass, I will propose a method to burn these TKN via a public function as well.\n* Therefore, the arb fast lane becomes siloed from BNT burning, which becomes the sole activity of the Carbon vortex.\n* The overall architecture is more efficient in terms of gas, which may result in better arbitrage engagement, better volumes and order fulfillment.\n\n# FOR  \nUpdate the Fastlane Contract as outlined above.\n\n# AGAINST \nTake no action.",

      "title": " Fast Lane Parameter Adjustment to 1,000 BNT cap for callers",
      "content": "TL;DR\n\n* This proposal is for a parameter adjustment for the fast lane\n* The original proposal is here: https://gov.bancor.network/t/proposal-improved-value-capture-and-fast-lane-poc/4142\n* A previous parameter change is here: https://gov.bancor.network/t/fast-lane-update-and-parameter-adjustment/4215\n* This proposal seeks to update the BNT cap (currently set to 100 BNT) to 1,000 BNT\n\n**Summary**\n\nThis is fairly simple and straight forward.  Gas on Ethereum spikes to huge prices (especially with the MEME coin excitement).\n\nAs a consequence, the cost to a caller in gas is very often more expensive than the 100 BNT reward.\n\nThis results in no incentive for anyone to trigger the contract => arbs are not closed => the protocol does not enjoy the benefit.\n\n\n**Proposed Solution**\n\nEdit the caller reward cap to 1,000 BNT.  This should mean that the system can continue to run even in extreme gas situation.\n\n# For\n\nUpdate the BNT reward cap for the caller to 1,000 BNT\n\n# Against\n\nDo nothing.",

Exchanging BNT to vBNT is thus a meaningless action, which thus lets us decide what to do with all these captured BNT.\n\nThat's why I propose to burn the total available BNT in the contract when it reaches exactly 2,000,420.69, in the spirit of the national holiday of Degens.  As it stands, this BNT won't be used for anything and it's basically burned already in a sense, but it doesn't reflect in the official numbers, like on etherscan shown here below. That's why we need to officially burn it to make this transparent for the community. How this burning will be managed? That I will leave to the devs, the only thing that's important is that it happens safely and is reflected in the contract.\n\n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreiga3qtmpolr62jqmpdgd3bprusgscdbdgv6xnbaiju5q7mjzb2h6y)\n    \n\nTL;DR:\n\n**Vote FOR to officially burn the total available BNT in the B3 vortex once it reaches  2,000,420.69**\n**Vote AGAINST leaving the BNT as it is.**",

As a reminder, it is not complete as it will continue to be adding additional exchanges (for example Balancer, Curve , Carbon).\n  * Fast Lane Smart Contract: https://etherscan.io/address/0x41Eeba3355d7D6FF628B7982F3F9D055c39488cB\n* Testing of the Smart Contract has been and is underway.\n* While the Fast Lane does indeed work, some parameter changes are required.\n* This proposal seeks to change the BNT split (burn and caller) from 90/10 to 50/50 in order for this system to become economically self-sustaining. The change seeks to ensure that the gas cost to reward a Fast Lane caller is not greater than the rewards themselves.\n\n# Summary\n\nAs noted above, the main functionality of the fast lane is complete.\n\nAs an example transaction, let’s look at: https://etherscan.io/tx/0x4069f5cae30d5de7e2bd0cbec541205b6a09ad0dd22e392d0c42b825c7400345\n\nWhile technical readers may be interested to see the full transaction, I would like to discuss the last two parts.\n\n![image](ipfs://bafkreicokn7okhqrq3bazq5pmvo4cghjudaclj5i44mm45f2bdec3ye6ei)\n\nThe top line in the image above is sending 116 BNT ($64) to the BNT token contract - where they are immediately burned.\n\nThe last, is sending 12 BNT ($7) to the address that informed the Fast Lane of the arbitrage - the caller.\n\nHowever, the associated gas with the tx was $13.\n\nAccordingly, this proposal seeks to change the BNT split (burn and caller) from 90/10 to 50/50 in order for this system to become economically self-sustaining.\n\n# Details\n\nThe data below only includes the data collected since the V3 fee exemption was implemented.\n\n*** Arb Stats ***\n\nNumber of Txs: 63\n\nUnique Callers: 3\n\nTotal Flash Volume: 924,380 BNT\n\nTotal BNT Burnt: 4,898 BNT\n\nAvg BNT Burnt: 78 BNT\n\n**Total Rewards Paid: 544 BNT**\n\n**Total Gas Paid: 0.998 ETH**\n\n*** LeaderBoard ***\n\nTop Burn: 227.51 BNT\n\nArb Path: ['Bancor V3', 'Uniswap V2', 'Bancor V3']\n\nTxhash:https://etherscan.io/tx/0x28955fc40e6f96c30813f8070d9d83226652c6a58556889ac2dc8f0c5e76cc18\n\n*** Interactions Count ***\n\nBancor V2: 0\n\nBancor V3: 63\n\nUniswap V2: 37\n\nUniswap V3: 12\n\nSushiswap: 14\n\nAs highlighted in bold above, the rewards paid to the caller are not sufficient to cover the gas at the moment.\n\n# Next Steps\n\nIf this proposal passes, further testing will be done with the new rates and updates will follow.\n\nAdditionally, the open sourcing of a bot that can find these are opportunities is expected shortly. Such a bot would have parameters that individual users can set based on their preferences to try to compete for the caller rewards.\n\n# FOR\n\nChange the Fast Lane BNT rewards split from 90/10 to 50/50\n\n# AGAINST\n\nTake no action",

      "content": "# TLDR:\n\n* Since the events of June 2022 the Bancor DAO has been working to reduce the deficit\n* V2.1 uses all of its revenue (network fees) to power the vortex\n* V3 uses 90% of revenue to collect BNT here: https://etherscan.io/address/0xeEF417e1D5CC832e619ae18D2F140De2999dD4fB#readProxyContract\n* DeFi involves many different ecosystem players that each perform some function and collect some payment\n* This proposes that if ANYONE in the community:\n  * Can identify value leaving the protocol\n  * Can identify a way for the protocol to recapture that value\n  * Can do so in a way where all benefits are directly returned to the protocol/LPs\n  * That community member should propose to the DAO their mechanism and anything required to allow it to run.\n    * For example, this proposal will suggest a proof of concept (POC) for Bancor Fast Lane.\n    * Bancor Fast Lane is a contract whose goal is to take the profit typically earned by external arbs and use those gains to reduce the deficit\n    * To work, Bancor Fast Lane requires a new smart contract or upgrade to V3 contracts.   Details below. \n\n# Introduction:\n\nBefore the events of June 2022, the Bancor DAO was working to make the protocol more efficient by fine tuning the trading liquidity and pool fees.\n\nAfter the events of June 2022, there have been an abundance of innovative ideas from the community on how to improve protocol efficiency. For example:\n\n* Using Almanak for parameter suggestions\n* Dynamic fees\n* Protocol level arbs\n* Changes to the behavior of the vortex (who can trigger, what to burn, reward levels)\n* Integrations\n* Programmatic ways to define V3 settings\n* Dynamic pool weights\n* And more…\n\nHowever, while many of these ideas show potential, there are some cases where small upgrades to the smart contracts can magnify the impact of the suggestion.\n\nIn such cases, it is proposed that the proposer outlines precisely how they can make the protocol more efficient and what is needed in order to do so.\n\n# Proof of Concept - Bancor Fast Lane\n\nAny member of the community can make a proposal with the following recommended elements for consideration, as demonstrated here by the Bancor Fast Lane POC:\n\nIdentify Value Leaving the Protocol\n\n* Arbs in AMMs keep prices balanced with external markets\n* Arbs perform this function to profit when prices diverge across protocols\n* This proposal suggests that instead of allowing arbs to extract value from Bancor protocol with no competition, the protocol essentially also arbs itself and uses gains to reduce the deficit\n\nIdentify a way for the protocol to recapture that value\n\n* The Bancor Fast Lane (outlined in more detail below) will arb the protocol\n* All profits generated by the Fast Lane will be converted to BNT and then burnt (excluding a fee to whoever identifies the arb and sends it to the contract).\n* In addition to making the protocol more efficient, this is likely to reduce the deficit\n\nDo so in a way where all benefits are directly returned to the protocol/LPs\n\n* The Bancor Fast Lane will not take any profits for itself. All gains are converted to BNT and burned (excluding a fee to whoever identifies the arb and sends it to the contract)\n* The finders fee will be 10% of the profit capped at 100 BNT  (These are DAO controlled parameters)\n* This will be verifiable on-chain\n\nPropose to the DAO a mechanism and anything required to allow it to run.\n\n* This proposal requires a new contract (or upgrade to V3) to allow for the flow below:\n- User finds an arb\n- User puts relevant inputs in the contract\n- Contract does a BNT flashloan\n- Contract does the trades exempt from pool fees \n(Note: an experiment will be done to test  first without an exemption from pool fees to see if this is required.  If it is found that it performs well without the exemption, an update will be shared on this post.)\n- Contract gives the wallet who called the function a finders fee (10% of the profit capped at 100 BNT -  These are DAO controlled parameters)\n- Sends the rest of the BNT to the token contract where it is burned: https://etherscan.io/address/0x1F573D6Fb3F13d689FF844B4cE37794d79a7FF1C\n\n* This proposal suggests making all V3 pool fees at least .5% (not including ETH, DAI, LINK, WBTC) as their pool fee changes are coming from Almanak ([link](https://snapshot.org/#/bancornetwork.eth/proposal/0xaa0d83aa06814e49942392a1c64220858c68fb7d8b2c86765687d373e3c39598))\n* Raising the pool fees allows the Fast Lane a significant advantage against generalized arb bots\n* It is expected to result in a decline in trading fees as LPs will not directly benefit from trades performed with 0 fees.\n* However, the arb-ing of the pools and burning of any BNT gained, is likely to result in better economic outcomes for LPs by reducing the deficit in the pools.\n\n# Fast Lane Functionality\n\n* Continuously search all pools on Bancor\n* Find potential arbitrage opportunities on:\n  * Uniswap V2\n  * Sushi\n  * Uniswap V3\n  * Curve\n  * Dodo\n  * Balancer\n    * Note: Not all of these will be live on day 1 and this list is expected to expand with time.\n* Calculate optimal trades\n  * This will start as a simple calculation that improves over time.\n  * This must account for expected gas cost and trade fees to ensure the trade is profitable.\n* Inform the contract of the trade\n\nNote: Arb performance should be expected to improve over time.\n\n# Implementation Components include:\n\n* New contract or upgrade to V3\n* Fee Changes\n  * Please see the table in the appendix\n\n# For\n\nCreate a contract allowing trades exempt from pool fees as part of the Fast Lane and move all pool fees below .5% to .5% on V3 (excluding ETH, WBTC, LINK, DAI).\n\n# Against\n\nDo nothing.",

Any other proposal that is not of imminent importance to the continuity of the project is not exempted.”\n\n## Summary\n### Plan A\n\n- If this proposal passes, then the protocol owned renBTC will be removed from the vault and converted to BNT using DeFI protocols.\n  - Note: This is likely to involve more than one transaction to reduce slippage (for example, renBTC = > WBTC => ETH => BNT)\n\n### Plan B\n\n- If there is not sufficient liquidity to do this by the time the vote concludes, this proposal suggested unwrapping renBTC and then wrapping it to WBTC. Once that is done, the same conversion to BNT and burn events will follow.\n\n**FOR**: Allow the Bancor protocol to withdraw its renBTC, convert this to BNT and burn it.\n\n**AGAINST**: Take no Action",

(hereafter, ‘Residual’), will build and maintain the BancorP2P front-end, and will not charge the Licensee, Bancor, development or maintenance fees (development is estimated to cost around $50,000 of Residual’s own capital, and maintenance is approximately $3,000/mos). Bancor will not incur any out-of-pocket licensing or whitelisting fees for hosting BancorP2P.\n\nBancor’s treasury will earn 10% of the reserves generated from borrowers connecting through BancorP2P. In other words, it will earn a portion of the APY that BancorP2P borrowers pay on loans, and in the case of loan defaults, it will earn a portion of the recovered collateral.\n\nAdditionally, revenues from existing Bancor trading tools are projected to increase due to higher trading volume. Residual projects a 30-40% increase in Bancor’s trading volume as users take advantage of interest paying deposit accounts and affordable loans available through BancorP2P. Detailed projections are available in the Forecast section below.\n\nNote, the extent of work required to be undertaken by Bancor - at its own expense - will be:\n\n* Adding hyperlinks to the Bancor website that point to BancorP2P.\n* Advertising BancorP2P to both existing and future Bancor users.\n\nAt the user level, BancorP2P will:\n\n* Empower Metamask, Wallet Connect and Coinbase Wallet users to earn APY - without relinquishing custody of their cryptocurrency to a third-party - via BancorP2P‘s Supply or Deposit function;\n* Allow users to borrow a select set of cryptocurrency types on an overcollateralized basis at reasonable APYs; and\n* Provide users the ability to leverage up, short sell certain assets, or increase purchasing power using safe, reliable and easy-to-use features.\n\nBancor’s users will also have the added bonus of combining the above benefits with the robust trading tools already offered by Bancor, thus spending more time in the Bancor ecosystem, and increasing overall engagement with the Bancor product suite.\n\nThe BancorP2P user interface will be custom designed to fit Bancor's existing brand style. Below are sample images of Residual's own front-end, ReserveLendingTM. The BancorP2P front-end will share a similar overall layout, along with custom Bancor theming across multiple webpages.

These experts will provide knowledge to the Bancor community on strategies to employ depending on Bancor’s users’ wishes and market conditions.\n\nFor\n\nOnboard Bancor as a Licensee to BancorP2P, a front-end of the ReserveLending Core. Residual will build the customized front-end for Bancor at no cost to Bancor. BancorP2P will provide Bancor users access to the ReserveLending Core in an experience simpatico with the Bancor platform today, and will earn Bancor 10% of reserves generated through BancorP2P. Bancor - at its own expense - will add hyperlinks to its website that point to BancorP2P, and will advertise BancorP2P to its users.\n\nAgainst\n\nDo not onboard Bancor as a Licensee to BancorP2P.\n\nContext\n\nIn business since 2017, Residual Token, Inc. is a Fintech SaaS company specializing in banking, Web3 and DeFi software development. Licensing software is Residual's primary source of revenue, and a live utility token, eRSDL, is used as part of its Licensing-as-a-Service (LaaS) model, which is explained in detail here: https://unfed.info/LaaS\n\nThe ReserveLending Core is a retail DeFi protocol for overcollateralized Pool-to-Peer1 lending and borrowing that is owned by Residual. The Core is based on the Compound® Protocol, which is non-custodial, meaning that Residual does not have control over supplied assets, and users are not exposed to the typical risks inherent in centralized custodial lending. The Core is also permissionless, meaning that any address is free to access the Core's liquidity pools. A review of the Core’s activity can be found here: https://dune.com/ethpanda/unFederalReserve-TVL\n\nFront-ends (interfaces) to the Core allow users to supply assets to earn APY, and optionally use their supplied assets as collateral to borrow on margin. Users across all Core front-ends share access to the same Core liquidity pools. This means that a user accessing the Core from one front-end can supply assets to a liquidity pool; while a user accessing the Core from another front-end can borrow those assets from the same liquidity pool (assuming the borrower has supplied enough collateral to satisfy this key condition to the loan).\n\nResidual hosts a front-end to the Core, branded ReserveLending™. Residual also offers front-end licenses to third parties (Licensees). Front-ends are custom-themed for Licensees, allowing for seamless integration with existing branded ecosystems.\n\nResidual will build and maintain a customized front-end for Licensees, and will not charge Licensees development or maintenance fees. Furthermore, Licensees will not incur any out-of-pocket licensing or whitelisting fees for hosting a front-end.\n\nThe extent of work required to be undertaken by a Licensee - at its own expense - will be:\n\n* Adding hyperlinks to its website that point to the front-end.\n* Advertising the front-end to both existing and future users.\n\nAllocation of Reserves\n\nThe reserves accumulated by the Core are allocated to:\n\n1. Rewards paid to Licensees\n2. License fees collected by Residual Token, Inc. (aka unFederalReserve)\n\nRewards paid to Licensees\n\nThe total allocation of Licensee rewards is divided amongst Licensees in amounts reflecting the percentage of the total TVL that is borrowed from the Core through each Licensee's front-end. Residual tracks and reports on these amounts using URL-related analytics and activity mapping. In this case, Residual will track Core activity tied to the BancorP2P front-end - using its URL - when estimating the licensing fee. Please refer to the Forecast section for detailed reward projections.\n\nLicense fees collected by Residual Token, Inc. (aka unFederalReserve)\n\nGiven that Licensees do not pay any out-of-pocket licensing fees, Residual collects licensing fees from the Core reserves. In line with the Licensing-as-a-Service (LaaS) model, part of the licensing fees will be directed to reimburse Residual for its costs and profit expectations, and part will be used to conduct open market purchases of eRSDL tokens (eRSDL tokens are digital markers representing license state, and are burned as licenses are consumed).\n\nLicensee benefits of hosting a Core front-end:\n\n* Rewards. Licensees are rewarded part of the Core reserves. A Licensee’s rewards reflect the TVL that is borrowed from the Core through its front-end. The greater the amount borrowed, the greater the rewards.\n* No out-of-pocket licensing or whitelisting fees.\n* Residual will not charge development or maintenance fees.\n* Expansion of product offerings to both existing and potential users.\n* Removal of the need to build, test, maintain and audit a similar platform in-house.\n* The Core has undergone extensive security tests and audits; most notably Trail of Bits successfully completed an audit just a few months ago.\n* In-house Core access means that a Licensee’s users no longer have to visit potentially risky third-party lending services.\n\nUser benefits of accessing the Core via a front-end:\n\n* Users can access global liquidity pools that are also accessed by users of other front-ends. As more users are introduced through new front-ends, the size of these liquidity pools is expected to grow significantly.\n* Users can earn APY by supplying assets.\n* Users can earn profits by shorting assets:\n\n1. Supply asset\n2. Borrow asset to be shorted\n3. Swap out of borrowed asset into a stable coin on a DEX/CEX\n4. Swap back into borrowed asset at a lower price\n5. Pay off borrowed asset\n\n* Users can take advantage of arbitrage opportunities:\n\n1. Supply asset\n2. Borrow asset\n3. Use borrowed asset to invest elsewhere. Profits or APY earned elsewhere should be greater than the Core spread (spread = borrow APY less supply APY, which is the effective cost of borrowing in the Core).\n\n* The Core has undergone extensive security tests and audits.\n* The front-end templates used to access the Core are designed for optimal user experience and ease-of-use.\n\nDiagram I: Global Liquidity Pool “Core” Schematic\n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreic3oya3pjnewkhreevh2xc3fhuowhpias2224etptapkq37heh7jy)\n    \nForecast\n\nThere are a variety of key performance indicators (KPIs) to consider when measuring the success of the Bancor-Residual collaboration. The key driver of value for Bancor will be the Total Value Locked (TVL) borrowed from the platform. Residual expects approximately a third of Bancor’s users to be interested in using BancorP2P's deposit capabilities alone, without necessarily leveraging themselves or executing one of the shorting strategies discussed earlier. Given where Residual has seen market rates for borrowing, Residual expects Bancor’s treasury to earn a 10% royalty on the estimated 3% reserve fee revenue (refer: Table 1). This 30bps is almost double to triple the standard 0.125% broker fee other borrowing lead-generation platforms receive.\n\nTable 1: Pro Forma Licensing Revenue for Bancor Treasury\n\n![image](ipfs://bafkreigvvf7vfn6ahc5yf2jt264xwldblk4mnfy7br5t7eu6rig5ls4xua)\n    \n\nThe figures above represent estimates made by the management of Residual for the purposes of illustrating the potential revenue stream for Bancor’s treasury. These estimates should not be relied upon as anything more than Residual’s best guess as to the volume the Bancor user base would generate. Residual started with an aggressive growth curve for 2023, assuming a general market turn-around and increased adoption of Bancor as BancorP2P and other products are added to Bancor’s offering.\n\nIn this model, for instance, Residual assumes that average borrows can reach $200 million by the end of year 2, and continue experiencing significant growth in the following years. One way to verify or validate this assumption is by extrapolating from current usage trends. If just a tenth of the current daily trade volume went into deposits and was held there, then by year-end, the outstanding borrow balance would be around $50 million.\n\nAdditional to the above projections, BancorP2P saving, lending and borrowing activity is estimated to result in a 30-40% increase in Bancor’s trading volume, thus resulting in an increase in its trading-derived revenues. The basis of this estimate is as follows:\n\nThe main use cases for borrowing off Pool-to-Peer lending platforms at present are for shorting from one of the liquidity pools and/or for leveraging into another purchase (note: debt consolidation, one-time purchases, \"quiet selling\", etc., are all considered, but are not the main drivers behind margin borrowing in crypto). Also, Cointelegraph reports that, “... utilization rates, or the percentage of stablecoins taken out as loans versus total supplied, have also fallen to around 30% to 40%... “. Thus, Residual foresees similar metrics for Bancor; whereby its users will supply onto BancorP2P, borrow stables, wBTC or ETH and use those funds to swap into new tokens through Bancor.\n\nInterest Rate Models and Pricing Oracle\n\nThe Core’s current APY model for USDC, DAI, and USDT is a JumpRate Version 2 model described in detail here: https://docs.cream.finance/lending/interest-rate-model\n\nThe model calls for the following inputs when calculating an APY:\n\nBase Rate (Borrow) that includes a floor borrow rate, and logic to increase the borrow rate depending on utilization. At a certain utilization, or percentage of borrows vs total supply, the rate “jumps” to provide a repayment and supplying incentive.\n\nThe jump rate for borrowing includes factors such as:\n\n* A multiplier based on utilization;\n* A JumpMultiplier when utilization exceeds a “Kink” amount; and\n* A Kink amount or utilization rate above which triggers the JumpMultiplier.\n\nThe existing factors for each pool that determine its utility include:\n\n* Collateral Factor: The Collateral Factor is the percentage of value that one is able to borrow against their total supply value. Looking at historical price data, Residual found a 90% collateral factor on stables to be a sensible choice. This higher collateral factor helps protect accounts’ positions from volatility of asset prices, and from liquidations. This assumption is based on Gauntlet’s simulation risk report done on the Compound protocol.

      "content": "# Voting instructions\n\nVote FOR to grant the DAO mult-sig signers the authority to migrate v2.1 POL Surplus to v3 and re-enable direct withdrawal from V2.1 per the 4 phase migration strategy detailed below.\n\nVote AGAINST to take no action.\n\n# Summary\n\nThe purpose of this proposal is to come to a final resolution to v2.1/3 migration and surplus discussion that has been ongoing for over 110 days. This topic has been extensively discussed and the proposal is in alignment with what seems to be the community consensus for a path to resolution.\n\nThe previous discussions are linked below for your ease of reference and based on @NIX 's detailed 4 part migration analysis within. For ease of reference, the historical chats are provided below:\n\nhttps://gov.bancor.network/t/proposal-move-v2-1-liquidity-to-v3/3872/229?u=infoparity\n\nhttps://gov.bancor.network/t/migrate-pol-from-v2-1-to-v3/4081?u=infoparity\n\n# 4 Phase V2.1 POL Surplus Migration and V2.1 Withdrawal Strategy\n\n## Phase 1: Cooldown Period\n- Provide a 1 week cooldown period for v2.1 LPs to make a final determination to migrate to v3 or stay in 2.1. \n\n## Phase 2: Permanently stop migrations to v3\n- Remove the ability for v2.1 to migrate to v3 permanently after the cooldown period has lapsed. This prevents gaming the system to minimize an LP's potential losses. After this phase is complete **migrations from 2.1 to 3 are permanently deprecated**.\n\n## Phase 3: Move v2.1 POL Surplus\n- Move the POL surplus for v2.1 pools in surplus per XRX's analysis (see above 4 part post in \"Summary\" section).\n\n## Phase 4: Reopen v2.1 withdrawals\n- After POL surpluses are migrated, reopen the ability to withdraw from v2.1. LPs withdrawing from v2.1 will experience **true impermanent loss**, not the additional re-balancing losses based on XRX solution.\n\n# Conclusion\nComing to a resolution on the 2.1/3 migration debate is a critical step to alleviating the v3 deficit and honoring protocol obligations for legacy LPs in 2.1. The 4 phase strategy provides a clear end to the debate, allowing the DAO to focus all resources on further improvements to v3 and the new v4 protocol which will soon be shared. Thank you for your consideration and I look forward to coming to a solution.\n",

      "title": "Proposal: Implement Almanak’s daily trading fee and trading liquidity recommendations",
      "content": "Bancor DAO Almanak Proposal #1 - \n\n## Summary\n\n[Almanak](https://almanak.co/), a revenue - optimization & risk management platform for DeFi & Gaming, has created a [Protocol Economy Assessment Report for Bancor DAO.](https://almanak.co/reports/Almanak_x_Bancor_Report_-_Protocol_Economy_Assessment_V1_September_2022.pdf)\n\nAlmanak would like to propose an ongoing long-term collaboration with the Bancor DAO, where Almanak would deliver regular actionable, data-based recommendations on protocol parameters. Approval of this proposal would grant the Bancor DAO multisig the permissions to implement daily fee and trading liquidity updates recommended by Almanak without a DAO vote.\n\nFOR:\n\nImplement Almanak’s daily trading fee and trading liquidity recommendations for the ETH, DAI, LINK, and wBTC pools over the course of 3 months (ending December 31st, 2022) without a Bancor DAO vote and to be executed by the Bancor DAO.\n\nAGAINST:\n\nDo not implement recommendations from Almanak.\n\n## Context\n\n[Almanak](https://almanak.co/) is an institutional risk management & revenue-optimization platform, engaging in performance-based, long-term partnerships through the provision of data-driven recommendations and C-level intelligence to DAOs and management teams of blockchain-based projects.\n\nAlmanak uses agent-based modeling to simulate and optimize decentralized finance protocols towards sustainable growth, competitiveness and innovation. The intelligence it provides delivers economic security, while simultaneously maximizing key profitability metrics.\n\nLearn more about Almanak by following it on[ Twitter](https://twitter.com/Almanak__) and[ Medium](https://almanak-co.medium.com/).\n\nAlmanak proposes a collaboration with Bancor DAO to design, deploy and maintain a customized protocol risk management framework that will ensure the protocol’s sustainable growth and competitiveness. The goal of this proposal is to present Almanak’s engagement offer towards the DAO.\n\n## Bancor V3 Case Discussion\n\nBancor DAO recently disabled BNT distribution due to an emergency action taken to preserve the health of the protocol and users' funds. Almanak has looked into the potential optimization levers of the Protocol in order to mitigate the potential risk of realized and unrealized vault deficits, and to maximize the Protocol’s revenues. Such optimization levers are (i) on-curve trading liquidity (TL) size, (ii) dynamic swapping and withdrawal fees, (iii) external liquidity protection pools sizes, and (iv) dynamic cool-down periods, .\n\nRecognizing the changes within the Protocol, Almanak has shifted its focus towards an optimization plan for Bancor V3 to achieve the Protocol sustainability.\n\n## Outline for a Proposed Optimization Plan\n\nThe main objective under the current conditions should be to decrease the deficit of the already existing pools. Bearing in mind the recent Protocol update, we have focused on the analysis and optimization of the following elements:\n\n### Objectives\n\n* Maximization of the Protocol’s revenue (protocol capital efficiency).\n* Minimization of the Protocol’s exposure to unrealized vault deficits.\n* Minimization of the recovery time of the Protocol’s deficit (protocol reactiveness).\n\n### Parameters\n\n* Pool swapping fees - optimization of the fees per pool (dynamic or static) to maximize the Protocol’s revenues from trading.\n* Pool depths - optimization of the on-curve trading liquidity, in order to minimize protocol’s exposure to further deficit.\n\nAlmanak proposes to execute the recovery efforts, while being mindful about maintaining a secure and stable transition towards the protocol’s new state.\n\n### Scope of work\n\n* Provide recommendations on optimizations to the each token pool’s trading fees and available trading liquidity over an initial period of 3 months on four pools : ETH, LINK, WBTC and DAI\n* use the legacy split approved Bancor DAO (90:10) between fees used for the Vortex burner and TKN LPs.\n\n## Scientific Methodology\n\nWe leverage our agent-based simulation platform to identify the best possible sets of parameters to shorten the path to recovery of the protocol. Based on the 24h-volatility, Almanak's platform simulates 7000 price trajectories to measure how agents behave in each of the scenarios.\n\nWe distinguish three relevant types of agents for the Protocol: liquidity providers, traders and arbitrageurs. Prior to an optimization run, simulation agents are being re-trained and adjusted based on the latest data from the past months. We perform overfitting tests to validate the calibration.\n\nTo measure the efficacy of the simulation and agent-based modeling solution, we run walk forward optimization and tests which not only validate our approach but help refine hyperparameters.\n\nFinally, we select the optimal pool swapping fees and on-curve trading liquidity that maximize the protocol revenue and minimize pool exposure to deficit. The results are being presented and updated every 24 hours to act re-actively upon market conditions.\n\n## Simulation Results and Optimization Recommendations\n\nAlmanak conducted optimization simulations for four main Bancor pools (ETH, LINK, WBTC and DAI). As of the time of simulation (August 2022), these four pools represent an aggregated 67% of USD volume and 45% of transactions for WITH trades, and respectively 43% and 71% for FOR trades.\n\nThe scope can be extended to more pools as required by Bancor DAO. For illustration, below are presented the results charts for the ETH pool as well as the Daily Revenue and Burning Ratio comparative analysis for the aggregated four pools.\n\n### ETH Pool\n\nChart 1: ETH Pool Unrealized Vault Deficit\n\n![image](ipfs://bafkreihoprb2ypuj4amxifxspzl4hck6zdvy5h2pgjtnwuafgjwkxehf6q)\n    \n\nVault deficit and represents the current delta between the value of assets deposited and staked by liquidity providers and the actual value available within the vault. Note that the difference between the two values was compensated via BNT distribution prior to 6/19.\n\nTo conclude, reducing the TL of a pool helps to reduce the impact on IL. Transferring funds out of TL into the vault secures LP assets, which in a first instance limits the protocol deficit. Secondly and acting with a bigger impact, these assets were only subtle to market changes as long as they were available within the trading pool. Not being part of TL anymore, LPs will need less compensation, as more assets are available.\n\nLastly, the following trend can be observed: the smaller the weighted TL size is, the higher the impact on the Protocol’s deficit. To do so, the Protocol would have to limit its TL in a volatile environment drastically to reach a smaller deficit.\n\nChart 2: ETH Pool Profit (net revenue minus realized vault deficit)\n\n![image](ipfs://bafkreiaqzubrjxhspzishdsnis7lionefxojinolrijsh3q5wxoi7riebq)\n    \n\nBy the shape of the dark coloured cells one can observe a general tendency towards smaller pool depths and higher trading fees.\n\nExtremes observed at the top right and bottom left corners represent highly volatile market scenarios which can be schematically split in two opposite configurations:\n\n- (i) when a market breakdown is imminent: profits can be maintained with high swapping fees and smaller TL.\n- (ii) when no crash is present: profits are generated through high TL and low swapping fees.\n\nThese configurations being extreme, they are less frequent in the sampled simulation distribution, therefore also indicating less robust optimization solutions. Indeed, sets at the bottom left represent less than 0.01% each on average and the top right is 0.05%. The most common and robust solutions are located in the center of the heatmap, with an average representative share of 1.2%.\n\n### Daily Revenue\n\nChart 3: Comparison of Daily Protocol Revenue – 5-Day Moving Average\n\n![image](ipfs://bafkreic4hwpk3zrmmydqafu53tokiufig6o6an34l4ha6kcioesu3dq6ja)\n    \n\nThe cumulative Daily Revenues over 30 days is USD 551,552 and USD 469,777 for the Optimized and Non-Optimized solutions respectively.\n\nWhen moving to a high-level view, revenue on a daily scale is an easier path to compare two different solutions and their impact on a particular metric. In this case, Almanak’s solution outperforms the current Bancor solution on most days. The main reason behind this is the limited TL following a volatile market. While the current Bancor solution has always historically kept all tokens on-curve available for trading , the introduced risk levers help deploy funds tactically based on market conditions and produce lower slippage and better execution in these times.\n\n### Burning Ratio\n\nChart 4: Comparison of Daily vBNT Burn – 5-Day Moving Average\n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreihnecildtwgw7vnyw4t7q6bzd2txdkrlgxeoe3hesz5asl6ihylsi)\n    \n\nThe cumulative vBNT Burn over 30 days is USD 1,180,113 and USD 1,004,115 for the Optimized and Non-Optimized solutions respectively.\n\nAs the vBNT burn is pegged to a fixed split of the incoming revenue (Chart 3), a high correlation of the burn of vBNT tokens with the latter can be observed.\n\nNote that in V3 90% are used to buy BNT but they are not yet swapped for vBNT burning (not implemented at the time of writing. The protocol is currently collecting this \"V3 BNT\" in a separate wallet. Next chart below is showing the accumulation with and without Almanak optimization.\n\nChart 5: Accumulated V3 vBNT\n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreid3f5y7fwk236dpyboiy7bn7sgfw63z4fbtdsqqoxilf5knea7bli)\n    \n\nThe accumulated “V3 vBNT” over 30 days is USD 1,180,113 and USD 1,004,115 for the Optimized and Non-Optimized solutions respectively.\n\n### Recommendation\n\nOverall, the current assessment focuses on what parameter combination limits the Protocol deficit, while increasing the profitability over the mentioned observation time. The main result brought forward by the Almanak’s protocol risk management framework is that the protocol profitability is a function of volatility and arbitrage volume, which can be actively managed through concerted tuning of the pools’ dynamic swapping fees and trading liquidity.\n\n## Implementation\n\n### Initial Phase – On-boarding and Build-out\n\nIn an initial phase, Almanak would provide recommendations for LINK, WBTC, DAI and ETH pools over a 3-month period.\n\nRecommendation would be provided daily on the following parameters:\n\n* Optimal trading fees per pool.\n* Optimal on-curve trading liquidity and strategy to shrink/grow the pool.\n\n### Execution of the Recommendations\n\nAlmanak will provide recommendations to Bancor DAO on the optimal trading liquidity and swapping fees size on a daily basis. We advocate daily recommendation as it brings better efficiency thanks to reactivity to past 24h market conditions. The main challenge is the implementation of the fee updates through the Bancor DAO's weekly voting procedure that usually spans over 72h and would therefore significantly tamper the efficiency of the recommendations. We are seeking approval from the Bancor DAO to bypass the required weekly voting procedure and instead implement daily trading fee and trading liquidity recommendations for the ETH, DAI, LINK, and wBTC pools over the course of three months.\n\nAlmanak will collaborate with the Bancor Protocol to update swapping fees and trading liquidity on a daily basis. The recommendation will be reported and displayed daily on a bespoke Bancor dashboard (see illustration below), designed by Almanak. The ETA for such a dashboard is 3 months, pending Bancor DAO’s feedback and expectations. In the meantime until the dashboard is ready Almanak will be putting our recommendations in Bancor's Discourse governance forums for the community to be kept up to date.\n\n![image](ipfs://bafkreicdg4uesv56ulpw75s2xjw6pxcdj3ktjplweev4fdmahxmr2u6yju)\n    \n\n## Further Collaboration\n\nAfter the 3-month initial phase and assuming positive feedback from Bancor DAO, Almanak would provide new proposals extending the services with new features. Almanak envisions a transparent, performance - based, long-term collaboration aimed at supporting Bancor DAO with key governance decisions with regards to protocol economy and profitability improvements.\n",

      "content": "## Voting Instructions\n### For: Perform a one time burn of 1m BNT collected in the v3 vault\n### Against: Do not burn BNT collected in the v3 vault\n\n## TL;DR\n\nBurn the BNT collected by the Bancor Vortex in the v3 vault when it reaches 1m\n\n## Intent and prior discussion\nThis proposal seeks to trigger a burn of 1m BNT once collected in the [Bancor v3 vault](https://etherscan.io/readContract?m=normal&a=0xeEF417e1D5CC832e619ae18D2F140De2999dD4fB&v=0xe2a2773a1aa412f10b9f338334f2d62b25dcd1f7#F9). At the time of writing, there is approximately ~868k BNT that has been collected so far. Given the current accumulation rate, 1m BNT can be expected to be hit within the next 30 days.\nThere have been multiple governance discussions around this topic in addition to a community call dedicated specifically to BNT vs. vBNT burning:\n[Vortex burn or wait](https://gov.bancor.network/t/feedback-request-v3-vortex-burn-the-collected-bnt-or-wait/3800/1)\n[Trial burning BNT](https://gov.bancor.network/t/proposal-14-day-trial-period-of-burning-bnt-instead-of-vbnt/3951/1)\n\n### Motivation\nThis proposal represents the community sentiment that the protocol should burn BNT as a trial to see if it will have a positive impact on BNT. DAO members have cited the fact that “burns” have a psychological effect on market participants and the same can happen if such an experiment is allowed to be carried out. For this reason, this proposal is seeking a one time burn of 1m BNT when this amount has accumulated in the Bancor v3 vault. If the community determines that this has a positive impact on the BNT token then future proposals can be expected specifying new BNT burn amounts\n\n",

The current status can be seen here: https://797.io/themerge/. More information about The Merge and how it relates to Bancor can be found in this post: https://gov.bancor.network/t/analysis-of-bancor-the-merge/4042\n\nA faction of Ethereum miners have indicated that they will create an Ethereum proof-of-work fork. This initiative appears to be an attempt for miners to squeeze additional value out of their mining equipment. While there may be some level of activity on the proof-of-work chain, the vast majority of users, developers, and protocols will continue with the proof-of-stake chain.\n\n## Course of Action\nThe end result of this is the necessity to make a decision on whether the Bancor DAO should disable the contracts on a proof-of-work fork, or do nothing. Below I've outlined the main arguments for each option.\n\n### Disabling Contracts\nThis option would include disabling all Bancor platform functions on an Ethereum fork. This option should incur little to no risk. The main argument for this is that most tokens on a proof of work fork will quickly become worthless, which would result in the Bancor platform being drained of any value that could be extracted on the forked chain. \n\n### Do Nothing\nThis option would be to do nothing in the event of an Ethereum fork. This would incur no risk to Bancor on Ethereum Mainnet, however, any value that could potentially be extracted from an Ethereum fork would be quickly lost.\n",

If this proposal passes, we can gather some results at the 30 day mark to see how 5% over the course of 30 days compared to 1% over the course of 30 days (we have this data).\n\nThe LPL pool on Bancor is unique since there is little to no liquidity on any other DEXes and therefore we have a moat. We have other tokens such as TRAC and ARCONA which have performed well on Bancor with high fees since we are the sole liquidity provider. It is therefore advantageous for us to charge a premium on swapping these tokens.\n\nThis might bode well for the long tail thesis which loosely states that the majority of long tail tokens tend to make up the largest majority of fee generation (or at least surpass those of the blue chip tokens combine).\n",

      "title": "Proposal: only DAO can receive vortex rewards",
      "content": "TLDR:\n\n- External function that triggers vortex and awards rewards to caller will be restricted to the DAO as the recipient\n- DAO will receive all vortex rewards\n- vortex cannot be zero due to gas etc. so this keeps more funds in the system by moving them to the DAO\n- In the future additional mechanisms may be needed if we observe front running etc.\n\nIn the spirit of mitigating the Bancor protocol leaking value.\n\nThe DAO currently has 0 BNT or any other assets in its treasury.\n\nThe vortex currently sets aside a reward to whoever initiates it.\n\nThe DAO can vote to restrict access to the vortex initiation function to itself.\n\nThis would assign all vortex rewards to the DAO treasury instead of anons.\n\nThis would increase funding for the DAO without decreasing protocol revenue.\n\nBetween each vortex initiation BNT is set aside off-curve, so it is effectively burned temporarily. There is no danger to the protocol functionality or tokenomics if the vortex is initiated more or less frequently due to the new access restrictions and active management.\n\nIn the future the DAO MAY choose NOT to initiate the vortex for some time if the vBNT price is unfavourable due to temporary market conditions. The lower the vBNT/BNT price when the vortex is initiated, the better the vortex is for long term protocol health.\n\nRead more about the Bancor Vortex Burner:\n\nhttps://docs.bancor.network/guides/triggering-the-bancor-vortex-burner\n\nThe reason we \"can't\" just ditch the vortex reward altogether and have 100% go towards the burn is that then someone has to call the function at a loss because of gas. If we remove the rewards altogether we have to find a reason someone would be willing to pay the gas cost to initiate the vortex, or an alternative source of funds to cover the gas.\n\nWe don't have alternative funding sources to pay gas, and there doesn't seem to be any reason for someone to altruistically call the vortex.\n\nBy definition nobody would normally initiate the vortex unless they made a profit, so in this case we may as well capture that profit for the DAO, as it was never going to go to the vortex anyway and is wasted on anons.\n\nFor a non-scientific-and-highly-variable-due-to-market-conditions-idea of the scale of this revenue:\n\n- Currently we see the vortex run every few hours so maybe 3-4 times a day\n- When anon calls the vortex they make about $20-30 after gas\n- If the DAO only calls the vortex 1 time per week (they have no competition) they can ignore the gas cost of all but 1 invocation\n- Gas costs about $100 so total reward of the vortex is about $100-150\n\nSo maybe we can expect somewhere around 25 invocations for $2-3k per week DAO revenue\n\nNOTE that technically all we need to do is set the DAO as a recipient so we MAY leave the vortex world-callable if that results in a better implementation at the smart contract level.\n\nFOR: Vortex will only be able to be receivable by the DAO\n\nAGAINST: Nothing changes",

      "content": "# TL;DR\n\nThere is a mismatch between the fee rate on v2.1 and v3. The DAO needs to decide whether to increase the v2.1 fee rate, or decrease the v3 fee rate, to align them. V2.1 has generated 2x the fees than v3. This is likely due in part to the lower fee rate, but also due to fewer integration established for v3. Decreasing the v3 fee to 0.1% (to match v2.1) aims to increase the fee revenue captured by the protocol, encourage integrations with v3, and allow for more accurate analysis between the two pools.\n\n# Key Points\n\n* Fee revenue for ETH is greater for v2.1 than for v3 despite v3 having higher liquidity.\n* ETH fee rate on v3 is 0.2% while on v2.1 the rate is only 0.1%. As per [BIP17](https://snapshot.org/#/bancornetwork.eth/proposal/0xb4dbbc5edb107d03bc43ebc23f37e996a3a04cb85ae6de2fbfe4860281e3987f)\n* Propose to decrease the ETH fee rate on v3 to 0.1% to capture additional fee revenue.\n* ETH is likely to become more highly traded as the PoS merge approaches, and could be an opportunity to capture more fees.\n\n# Discussion\n\nV2.1 is generating 3x the volume and 2x the fees with less liquidity than v3 (Table 1). While integrations could be responsible for v2.1 success, the fee rate likely plays a significant role. With a lower fee rate on v3 and the deeper liquidity, traders will be incentivized to utilize v3 pools and drive fee revenue to our LPs.\n\nTable 1. ETH pool comparison v2.1 and v3. Data as at 2022-08-08.\n\n|ETH Pool|v3|v2.1|delta|\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|Liquidity|$13,913,134|$11,141,519|125%|\n|Fee Rate|0.20%|0.10%|200%|\n|Volume - last 7d|$2,329,929|$8,480,699|27%|\n|Fees - last 7d|$2,333|$4,205|55%|\n|Trades - last 7d|332|2,364|14%|\n|Mean Trade Size|$986|$3,587|27%|\n|Mean Fee Size|$3.6|$1.8|202%|\n|Target:Source Split|51%|48%|106%|\n\nV3’s fee revenue is led by DAI, LINK and ETH (Figure 1) however v2.1 ETH fees are superior despite the higher trading liquidity on v3. The protocol needs additional volume, fees and more user integrations, all which are promoted by offering lower fees and aligning the ETH pools protocol-wide.\n\n![image](ipfs://bafkreienyi3lznqewfqz572w5erosrgd4b2anf2a5eu66ki6ullmykshva)\n\nFigure 1.

This post is to remind everyone that anyone, at any time, can make a proposal.\n\nYou don't even need to post anything in governance. That's just a formality to help people refine their ideas so that terrible posts like this don't appear.  You can set the vote to start instantly. There doesn't even seem to be a curation process. \n\nFurthermore, DAOs are not magic: even if a vote passes with 100% that doesn't mean it will just magically happen. \n\nTo prove this I will be intentionally absurd.\n\nIf you vote yes then I won't be a disappointment to my parents. \nVote no and I will continue to play Dungeons & Dragons.\n\nPlease use the link to formulate high level discussion for this post.",

      "title": "Proposal: All V3 pools to Max Approved Trading Liquidity",
      "content": "**Expected on Snapshot August 7th, 2022**\n\n# TL;DR\n\n* At the time of writing, there are 18 pools in V3 that are not at their maximum approved trading liquidity.\n* This proposal seeks to increase all the pools to the max\n* [BIP 15](https://vote.bancor.network/#/proposal/0x1e93b264bac99472fada3480eb7699b511eb23f5db14d0558648f1f66ee68889) outlined how trading liquidity is increased up to its max in the protocol\n* [BIP 17](https://vote.bancor.network/#/proposal/0xb4dbbc5edb107d03bc43ebc23f37e996a3a04cb85ae6de2fbfe4860281e3987f) outlined the max trading liquidity for each token\n* The protocol currently has deposits disabled so only migrations can increase TKN trading liquidity.\n  * NOTE: By the time this goes up for a vote it is possible deposits are enabled, but not via the UI\n\nTo solve this, a [proposal was passed by the Bancor DAO](https://vote.bancor.network/#/proposal/0x736ba431656adb798daea528ca9b84f5436c6ed384f43a296241f461bef12db1) to introduce a function to do this without deposits.\n\n# Context\n\nIncreasing trading liquidity in pools has two main effects:\n\n* Likely increase in fees - More liquidity means lower slippage, more volume from aggregators and a better deal for traders overall.\n\n* Potentially more deficit - Only the TKN that is on the bonding curve is exposed to IL/deficit\n  * If the ETH pool has 5 ETH on-curve and 20 ETH off-curve, only the 5 ETH on-curve is subject to IL/deficit while the 20 is not affected by market forces.\n\n# Parable of the Soccer Team\n\nAllow me to tell a brief story about a soccer team.  \n\nThe team didn’t play enough defense and is now losing 3-1 at halftime.\n\nDuring halftime, the team discussed options on what to do next.\n\nMany correctly pointed out that they are not playing enough defense so perhaps that's what they should focus on.\n\nHowever, a focus on defense at this point would almost guarantee they cannot win. Even though it’s counterintuitive, their best option at this stage is to press aggressively for offense.\n\n\n# Discussion\n\nIf we view the protocol as the team at halftime, I see many of the conversations in the community pushing for defense.  However, that seems to almost cement many of the existing deficits.\n\nThe logic here is that not using a pool’s maximum liquidity when it is in deficit actually reduces the ability of the pool to reach balance.\n\nWhile I understand the push to move TKN off-curve, I think the timing is wrong.  We should be putting TKN off the curve when those pools are in surplus, not deficit. \n\n# Data\n\n|Token|Percentage Increase in Trading Liquidity|Surplus %|\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|BBS|172%|-8.9%|\n|BORING|733%|-15.8%|\n|CHZ|51%|-43.5%|\n|DAO|605%|-10.3%|\n|ENS|100%|-18.7%|\n|GTC|81%|-2.2%|\n|HOT|1293%|-22.1%|\n|INST|247%|-41.5%|\n|LQTY|188%|-2.0%|\n|MFG|1642%|-6.3%|\n|MKR|64%|-68.5%|\n|RARI|107%|-4.7%|\n|RLC|33%|-6.8%|\n|RPL|142%|-45.3%|\n|SHEESHA|827%|-3.1%|\n|STAKE|16%|11.3%|\n|VITA|77%|0.0%|\n|WSTETH|144%|-4.5%|\n\n![image](ipfs://bafkreiakdszb4h7fwslidxr5nckuex5tc2p7g3oh5nr25cf7s4ar2l27qm)\n    \n    \n![image](ipfs://bafkreifiotlonbr7g25tbdgjemuglkv4lxxzsi6bdu4opbuiwjq7lsd5x4)\n    \n\nTokens Affected: 18\n\nAlso, an important consideration is that if we increase these pools to their maximum approved trading liquidity, we will have among the deepest DEX liquidity in Bancor pools for the following tokens.\n\n\n|Token|Max TKN Trading Liquidity (USD)|Uni V3 TKN Liquidity (USD)|Uni V2 TKN Liquidity (USD)|Sushi TKN Liquidity (USD)|Combined TKN Liquidity Outside Bancor (USD)*|Bancor to Outside Ratio*|\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|BBS|$38,683|$8,500|$0|$0|$8,500|455.10%|\n|BORING|$113,770|$10,000|$20,000|$0|$30,000|379.23%|\n|MFG|$224,326|$215,560|$3,024|$0|$218,584|102.63%|\n|HOT|$450,016|$458,580|$19,373|$1,000|$478,953|93.96%|",

Make sure to stake your vBNT for voting before this date and time to participate in the DAO decision.\n\nTo pass, this needs 35% Quorum and 66.7% FOR votes.\n\n## TLDR\n\n* Deposits were disabled and a proposal to ratify the decision made was voted on [here](https://snapshot.org/#/bancornetwork.eth/proposal/0xed5d4f4e1366257d88b04a01305769124271cb0163d3d0c543a1a26e6dd943e0).\n* Liquidity is needed to improve protocol health, drive trade volume and benefit from new fee-generating features. Growing pool depth / onboarding new tokens can increase fees.\n* Enabling deposits comes with risks that may not be easy to understand for less experienced users.\n* DAOs and projects willing to deposit should have a way of doing so.\n* This proposal seeks to enable deposits exclusively on-chain under two assumptions:\n  * Users that stake directly via the smart contracts are likely to be experienced DeFi users and understand the risks involved. To minimize this risk, the developer documentation shall be updated with disclaimers for any user seeking information on how to deposit.\n  * There is no risk that third parties supporting staking on Bancor with no disclaimers in place would see deposits being enabled with the change herein proposed.\n\n## Discussion\n\n* Liquidity is the key to the protocol's success and recovery and without deposits the protocol has no means of receiving new liquidity.\n* Allowing users to stake via the UI, even with disclaimers in place informing of the associated risks, may result in users staking in pools with an existing deficit without understanding what it means.\n* There have been multiple projects (CROWN, DBL, ACRE) that have applied for whitelisted status and been approved by the DAO but their pools are not yet live as a result of their inability to deposit.\n* Given continued interest from them and others, this proposal suggests we enable deposits on all pools exclusively on-chain, under the assumption that users who can send a transaction on-chain should be sophisticated enough to understand the risks associated with depositing.\n* A disclaimer will be added to Bancor’s dev docs if this proposal is approved.\n* There are no known third party front ends supporting staking directly on Bancor 3. The involved risk is that users of these platforms wouldn’t be informed of the involved risks with depositing their tokens.\n\nNote: This proposal is specifically referring to the tokens that were disabled as a result of the ILP pause and does not refer to those that were disabled for other reasons.\n\n## Voting Instructions\n\nFOR\n\nEnable deposits on all pools (excluding those that are disabled for reasons other than the ILP pause) exclusively on-chain (not via the UI).\n\n\nAGAINST\n\nTake no action.",

Make sure to stake your vBNT for voting before this date and time to participate in the DAO decision.\n\n * **FOR:** Enable deposits for CROWN and increase trading liquidity to 200k BNT\n * **AGAINST:** Do nothing\n\n##### TLDR:\n\n* Enable deposits for the CROWN token\n* Increase the trading liquidity to 200k BNT\n* The Crown DAO understands the risks & would like to proceed\n* Trading liquidity can be grown via an external trigger as outlined in [this proposal](https://gov.bancor.network/t/proposal-allow-the-bancor-protocol-to-grow-tkn-trading-liquidity-via-an-external-trigger/3762)\n\n### Overview:\n\nThe Crown DAO is eager to have a liquidity pool for CROWN tokens. While the current situation in Bancor is unfortunate, impermanent loss protection was never the main selling point for Crown - it was that single-sided liquidity frees up Crown’s treasury to fulfill its purpose: buying yield-generating gaming NFTs. As such, the DAO would like to enable deposits & begin bootstrapping the pool. Crown understands the risks associated with depositing into Bancor at the moment and would like to proceed.\n\n#### Trading Liquidity Increase\nWhen CROWN was originally whitelisted for 50k BNT trading liquidity, the price of BNT made the trading depth roughly ~$70k. Crown had originally planned to go through the whitelisting process, then attempt to increase the trading liquidity to around the $150k mark. With the current price of BNT, the 50k BNT trading depth would be around $25k, therefore Crown asks to increase the trading liquidity to 200k BNT. Note that there are already 256k CROWN tokens deposited in the External IL contract, as per our previous proposal, which can be seen in [Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/address/0xfd31662b3d54edde9b6bdd32c9c27c8e292cad57).",

      "content": "### This proposal is expected to appear on Snapshot for voting on [date=2022-07-31 time=15:00:00 timezone=\"UTC\"]. Make sure to stake your vBNT for voting before this date and time to participate in the DAO decision.\n\nTL;DR\n\n1. A recent proposal passed that let us grow the trading liquidity on pools via an external trigger.\n2. This proposal is seeking to grow the trading liquidity on the $USDT pool to its max (~$3.4m)\n\nThe Bancor DAO recently approved a proposal:\n\nhttps://gov.bancor.network/t/proposal-allow-the-bancor-protocol-to-grow-tkn-trading-liquidity-via-an-external-trigger/3762\n\nThat would allow us to grow the TKN trading liquidity on pools via an external trigger. Feedback from the community suggested that information be provided about which specific pools are going to be grown and by how much trading liquidity. This proposal is seeking to grow the trading liquidity on the $USDT pool to its max which is $3.4m (~$1.7m $USDT + ~$1.7m $BNT) as of this time of writing 7/19/2022.\n\n![image](ipfs://bafkreidpzr4go2mdmuh43jfpybow247qqcjnfoarsfsnofs7fvjgeyjlxy)   \n\nThe $USDT liquidity paired with $BNT in the V3 pool at the moment is ~38,285 $USDT tokens (as of time of writing 7/19/2022). There are currently ~1,724,414 $USDT tokens available for trading in the master vault.\n\nAt this stage, keeping the stable pools in Bancor small is counter productive to recovery efforts. They are gateway tokens for other assets listed on Bancor and the $USDT pool in particular sees a lot of action. This pool has already suffered damage due to having a deficit of ~40% and by removing liquidity from being on curve, we would be segmenting this IL permanently without it being able to recover in the future. An argument can be made that for this reason, this pool should be allowed to grow. Other tokens in similar situations should each individually be reviewed and analyzed.\n\nIt makes little sense to move tokens off-curve while their deficit is high. Consider the following simplified example:\n\nA pool is constructed with $USDT and $BNT, 1000 tokens either side (i.e. both tokens have equivalent value). Then, the value of BNT drops sharply by 50%, leaving 707.1067814 $USDT inside the pool, and a deficit of 29.28%. If the $BNT price recovers (i.e. 2×), the pool’s $USDT deficit recovers with it, back to 1000 tokens and a deficit of 0%.\n\nNow consider shrinking the pool by 50% after the sharp decline, moving 353.5533907 $USDT off-curve. During the same 2× price increase as mentioned above, the pool recovers to a depth of 500 $USDT; combined with the off-curve portion, the total $USDT is now 853.5533907, and a 14.64% deficit remains.\n\nAs a rule of thumb, shrinking the trading liquidity makes the most sense when the deficit is small or zero, or when the TKN vault balance is in surplus. Being that $USDT does not currently satisfy these considerations, and that it is a critical trading pair, there is little to argue in support of keeping the pool in its illiquid state.\n\nSince the beginning of the year volume data for this pools shows the following (v2.1 data):\n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreicevvxqll2gfsdeyuyzt7d4jrrixd2b7xfqloq2udusjtoizjvgze)\n\nAVG: $387,934.87\n\nMAX: $2,492,114.90\n\nMIN: $18,123.37\n\nWith the current liquidity on curve and with how liquidity in Bancor grows (always doubles from the current available trading liquidity on curve) then this means that the current TKN trading liquidity will grow in the following order:\n\n1. 38,285 → current\n2. 76,570 → first trigger to double the pool size\n3. 153,140 → second trigger to double the pool size again\n4. 306,280 → third\n5. 612,560 → fourth\n6. 1,225,120 → fifth\n7. 1,724,414 → sixth\n\nFor: Approve growing trading liquidity on the $USDT pool to its max\n\nAgainst: Do no grow trading liquidity on the $USDT pool",

This basically makes us the prime provider for LPL\n* Current swap fee is on UNI is also 1%, while having more than 10x less TVL than Bancor atm. Thus it should definitely not be strange to increase the current swap fee\n* An increased swap fee will help us siphon more profits from arbitrage trades and us being the prime provider, LPL trades will always flow through Bancor\n\n![image](ipfs://bafkreihi2anmtzfpxbbyisu67tncae6v4c3ggbxnp2xil4o62gdtkxtvfa)\n*Figure 1 - Current information for the LPL pool on B3:*\n\nThere are currently two pools besides Bancor on Uni V3 and V2, with 16.71k & 9.7k liquidity, respectively.\nAs seen in Figure 4 a swap of 5 ETH to LPL currently has a 34.35% impact on UNI V3 and a 4.85% impact on Bancor.\nThis confirms again that Bancor can provide the best price for LPL traders and thus set an increased fee on our pools without the risk of being undercut by the competition. \n\nI propose the following schedule for the gradual increase in the trading fee:\n\n1. 1 to 3%\n2. 3 to 5%\n3. 5 to 3%\n4. 3 to 1%\n5. Evaluation of all %, and final decision on what to do.\n\nAll steps will be performed weekly with the last week gathering all the data and analyzing the results.\n\n\n**Vote FOR to have the Trading Fee be changed according to the proposed schedule**\n**Vote AGAINST to keep the Trading Fee at 1%**\n\n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreidm3d5t37dibfnk76w3cqg6xtto2nasfxdzo5u3mb2ppmgrmdo7em)\n*Figure 2 – Weekly volume for the BNT-LPL pool (B3 only)*\n\n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreidlftlrqo2t3blkeszjyqwnhbqakgbkxdl2pdv75lwqibhy3uqrn4)\n*Figure 3 – Weekly fees for the BNT-LPL pool (B3 only)*\n\n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreiehsqyec655dmm4keq22t3ntrwjxg4pl43ggsq5hgmznzrbrzia2e)\n*Figure 4 – Comparison between 5 ETH swap on UNI V3 (Left) and Bancor (Right)* ",

      "content": "For this proposal to pass, it requires a 35% quorum and 66.7% supermajority.\n\nThis proposal is expected to appear on Snapshot for voting on [date=2022-07-31 timezone=\"Europe/London\"]. Make sure to stake your vBNT for voting before this date to participate in the DAO decision.\n\nWe originally allocated $25k for external IL protection for PDI our leading DeFi index comprised of the top assets from within the sector.\n\nhttps://gov.bancor.network/t/proposal-to-onboard-pdi-with-100k-bnt-trading-limit/3577\n\nNow that Bancor no longer mints new BNT to cover ILP it has removed the threat that new pools may impose on the BNT price. As a result, we would like to retrieve these funds so that we can put them to  better use attracting new PDI holders, through either the joint rewards programme or another channel. \n\nReasons for removing the external IL funds:\n*  IL burden on the BNT price has been significantly removed/mitigated.\n*  PDI is made up of the top assets in defi which have all moved out of their price discovery phase so it shouldn't be considered a \"new\" asset.\n* External IL funds can be used to more effectively bring new PDI holders into our Bancor pool. For example, by using the funds to participate in the joint rewards programme or providing rewards for holding PDI through other channels.\n* Given our company size it is important we minimise the opportunity cost of any allocated funds. The PDI attributed to the external IL fund can be re-purposed for a higher ROI without being concerned that the PDI pool is causing increased stress on the BNT price.\n\nFor: Approve repatriating the PDI funds in the external IL vault to the Phuture team\nAgainst: Do not approve the repatriation of the PDI funds in the external IL vault to the Phuture team",

      "title": "Proposal: only DAO can receive vortex rewards",
      "content": "This proposal is expected to appear on Snapshot for voting on [date=2022-07-24 timezone=\"America/Chicago\"].\n\nTLDR:\n\n- External function that triggers vortex and awards rewards to caller will be restricted to the DAO as the recipient\n- DAO will receive all vortex rewards\n- vortex cannot be zero due to gas etc. so this keeps more funds in the system by moving them to the DAO\n- In the future additional mechanisms may be needed if we observe front running etc.\n\nIn the spirit of mitigating the Bancor protocol leaking value.\n\nThe DAO currently has 0 BNT or any other assets in its treasury.\n\nThe vortex currently sets aside a reward to whoever initiates it.\n\nThe DAO can vote to restrict access to the vortex initiation function to itself.\n\nThis would assign all vortex rewards to the DAO treasury instead of anons.\n\nThis would increase funding for the DAO without decreasing protocol revenue.\n\nBetween each vortex initiation BNT is set aside off-curve, so it is effectively burned temporarily. There is no danger to the protocol functionality or tokenomics if the vortex is initiated more or less frequently due to the new access restrictions and active management.\n\nIn the future the DAO MAY choose NOT to initiate the vortex for some time if the vBNT price is unfavourable due to temporary market conditions. The lower the vBNT/BNT price when the vortex is initiated, the better the vortex is for long term protocol health.\n\nRead more about the Bancor Vortex Burner:\n\nhttps://docs.bancor.network/guides/triggering-the-bancor-vortex-burner\n\nThe reason we \"can't\" just ditch the vortex reward altogether and have 100% go towards the burn is that then someone has to call the function at a loss because of gas. If we remove the rewards altogether we have to find a reason someone would be willing to pay the gas cost to initiate the vortex, or an alternative source of funds to cover the gas.\n\nWe don't have alternative funding sources to pay gas, and there doesn't seem to be any reason for someone to altruistically call the vortex.\n\nBy definition nobody would normally initiate the vortex unless they made a profit, so in this case we may as well capture that profit for the DAO, as it was never going to go to the vortex anyway and is wasted on anons.\n\nFor a non-scientific-and-highly-variable-due-to-market-conditions-idea of the scale of this revenue:\n\n- Currently we see the vortex run every few hours so maybe 3-4 times a day\n- When anon calls the vortex they make about $20-30 after gas\n- If the DAO only calls the vortex 1 time per week (they have no competition) they can ignore the gas cost of all but 1 invocation\n- Gas costs about $100 so total reward of the vortex is about $100-150\n\nSo maybe we can expect somewhere around 25 invocations for $2-3k per week DAO revenue\n\nNOTE that technically all we need to do is set the DAO as a recipient so we MAY leave the vortex world-callable if that results in a better implementation at the smart contract level.\n\nFOR: Vortex will only be able to be receivable by the DAO\n\nAGAINST: Nothing changes",

As it currently stands, it’s still going through the V2.1 pool.\n\n**Reasoning** :\n\n* The VBNT V3 pool is currently bigger than the V2.1 one, meaning that v2.1 is subject to higher slippage on all swaps\n* The earnings from these swaps will be better distributed to BNT holders on B3, due to how B3 is designed ( in V2.1 it’s isolated per pool, while in V3 it’s spread across all BNT stakers)\n* It’s a good way to incentivize VBNT stakers to migrate their positions to V3. This way we don’t need a separate burner cap on the V2.1 VBNT pool, now that the vortex will be ramped up to a 100% (see [proposal](https://gov.bancor.network/t/proposal-increase-vortex-burn-to-100-for-v2-1-30-for-v3/3698))\n\nBelow the screenshots of the current V3 pool and V2.1 pool respectively:\n\n![image](ipfs://bafkreia2djf5vq3eobygm6bujeorclrkq3yi4edu6nteu4rrtx7w3ubxuu)\n\n[Etherscan link](https://etherscan.io/token/0x48Fb253446873234F2fEBbF9BdeAA72d9d387f94?a=0x649765821D9f64198c905eC0B2B037a4a52Bc373)\n\n![image](ipfs://bafkreiducraoh2pkw3c5zlyjd6kng7nqmcitqabmapxtnfglagxwym24g4)\n\n[Etherscan link](https://etherscan.io/address/0x8d06afd8e322d39ebaba6dd98f17a0ae81c875b8)\n\n**I believe the above reasoning makes this a logical choice and also preparation to completely migrate from V2.1, which will in turn make it easier for the developers to keep an organized view.**\n\n**TLDR;**\n\n<b>Vote FOR to have the vortex swaps route through the B3 pool\nVote against to have the vortex routing stay as it is.",

      "title": "Proposal: Allow the Bancor protocol to grow TKN trading liquidity via an external trigger",
      "content": "### This proposal is expected to appear on Snapshot for voting on [date=2022-07-10 time=15:00:00 timezone=\"UTC\"]. Make sure to stake your vBNT for voting before this date and time to participate in the DAO decision.\n\nTL;DR\n\n* An enhancement to the current workflow that allows for trading liquidity to be increased/decreased is being introduced. This enhancement is a function that has been developed and allows trading liquidity to grow/shrink in pools while deposits are disabled. If trading liquidity is being increased, it lets tokens that are sitting outside the bonding curve, be matched with BNT to be made available for trading. The opposite will occur if trading liquidity is decreased (tokens are moved out from the bonding curve).\n\n* In order to grow/shrink trading liquidity in pools, BNT minting (only when growing) needs to occur and this is typically triggered upon deposits. It is being proposed to the Bancor DAO to allow for this type of minting (only when growing) to happen without deposits via an alternative external trigger.\n\n* A preliminary list of pools that could potentially qualify for being grown via this external trigger are the following: \n\n$CROWN, $MFG, $PHTR, $MONA, $DAPP, $BBS, $wNXM, $DAI, $USDT, $USDC, $HOT, $BORING, $AMP, $LQTY, $MANA, $SHEESHA, $OCEAN, $UMA, $DAO, $MLN, $RLC, $RPL, $ENS, $DDX, $RAIL, $YFI, $GTC, $INST, $wSTETH, $RARI, $ANKR, $VITA, $GRT, $renBTC, $eRSDL, $IDLE\n\n* Assuming this proposal passes, then it would allow the Bancor DAO to increase the trading liquidity to its maximum capacity with the caveat that the limit to growth is still the pre-approved trading liquidity as voted on by the Bancor DAO for these tokens. See BIP17 for $BNT minting limits in B3 token pools (should be relatively up to date) https://gov.bancor.network/t/bip17-bancor-3-initial-whitelist-bnt-funding-limits-and-swap-fees/3513\n\n* There are currently no pools under consideration for shrinking their liquidity.\n\nDue to the emergency actions taken on 6/19:\n\nhttps://gov.bancor.network/t/ratification-of-emergency-actions-taken-on-sunday-19th-june-utc/3714/21\n\nBNT distribution for covering deficits in withdrawals was disabled. In addition, BNT deposits across the entire protocol were also disabled while the protocol has BNT distribution disabled. Increasing/decreasing the trading liquidity in pools (up to their specified trading liquidity limit) was triggered by deposits that are now disabled. This proposal is seeking to allow the DAO to trigger an increase of trading liquidity in pools via an external trigger and let tokens sitting outside the bonding curve be paired with BNT for trading liquidity. Note: we can also decrease trading liquidity in pools using this external trigger as well.\n\nThe Bancor DAO has already approved the trading liquidity limits for all tokens that are listed in Bancor 3. A large number of pools in Bancor 3 have TKN liquidity but have failed to grow to their full trading liquidity depth. Part of the reason for not being able to grow is that pools are required to be in a “stable” state (“ispoolstable” parameter returns true), meaning that the spot rate must be within 1% of the EMA (exponential moving average) rate. If it is not within this range then pools where “ispoolstable” returns false will not be allowed to have their trading liquidity increased.\n\nThe EMA was new to Bancor 3 and required some tuning in order to get it stable. Recent changes in Bancor 3 have allowed this to occur and even though pools might have EMA and spot rate within 1%, they are currently not able to grow their trading liquidity. The reason for this is because the “ispoolstable” check runs when an LP deposits or withdraws from Bancor. With deposits being disabled, this has made it very difficult to trigger the growth of trading liquidity in a pool.\n\nIt is worth mentioning that liquidity in a pool can only double from the previous amount. To illustrate, on Bancor 3 we need a minimum of 10K BNT in TKN liquidity in order to bootstrap a pool. This means that if a pool has been approved for 160K in BNT trading liquidity, that a deposit after the pool is bootstrapped would double the trading liquidity to 20K BNT. The next deposit would double the pool to 40K BNT, 160K BNT, etc… until the pool has grown to the BNT trading liquidity limit that has been approved by the DAO.\n\nIn order to allow for trading liquidity to grow in pools while deposits are disabled, an external function has been developed that can trigger a growth event (assuming that the spot and EMA rate are within 1% of each other). When these conditions are met, new BNT will be minted to grow the trading liquidity and given the current situation at hand (BNT distribution disabled) this proposal seeks to get approval from the Bancor DAO to allow for this type of minting to occur (grow trading liquidity in pools via an external trigger).\n\nFOR: Approved the minting of new BNT to grow trading liquidity in Bancor 3 Pools to the pre-approved limits by the DAO.\n\nAGAINST: Do not allow the minting of new BNT to grow the trading liquidity in Bancor 3 Pools",

      "title": "Ratification of Emergency Actions Taken on Sunday 19th June (UTC)",
      "content": "**This proposal is a ratification vote for emergency actions taken on Sunday 19th June (UTC) to prevent damage to the Bancor Protocol. The purpose of this vote is for the BancorDAO to determine whether the measures taken will remain in place until a long-term solution is proposed.** \n\n# Voting Instructions:\nA vote **FOR** will result in the emergency measures being left in place until a long-term solution is presented.\n\nA vote **AGAINST** will result in the steps taken to protect the protocol being reversed, thus returning the system to its vulnerable state.\n\n# Preamble\n\nA culmination of factors resulted in an emergency requiring special intervention to protect users of the Bancor protocol. The changes were applied at approximately 23:00 Sunday 19th June, 2022. Due to the emergency of the situation, these actions were taken without a prior DAO decision. The BancorDAO previously approved a proposal acknowledging that such emergency powers were necessary so that protective actions could be [expedited ahead of the formal voting](https://gov.bancor.network/t/bip21-dao-multisig-intervention-policy/3504) process, subject to a subsequent vote. Such an emergency presented itself, and actions were taken with the understanding that the BancorDAO would subsequently vote on whether the protective measures remained in place.\n\nBNT minting, normally used to cover impermanent loss insurance and deficits in withdrawals, was halted. The reason being, at the time, pending withdrawals in combination with the impermanent loss protection (see below) could have crashed the BNT price to essentially zero, leading to a situation in which the recovery of funds for all liquidity providers would have been in peril.\n\nThe route to irreversible damage, regardless of BNT printing rates (including zero inflation), can be illustrated as follows.\n\n1. A non-BNT liquidity provider exits from the protocol during a deficit - such as the case with LINK, ETH and wBTC prior to the emergency intervention.\n2. The protocol returns their tokens, including an amount of BNT as per the constant product portfolio evaluation alone, or with further compensation in newly created BNT (it makes little difference).\n3. The non-BNT liquidity provider then immediately swaps their BNT for the preferred TKN.\n4. Therefore, the relative deficit is further exacerbated; the rate of the deficit increase is faster with IL insurance (i.e. with additional BNT printing), but not contingent on it.\n5. Steps 1-4 can be executed by multiple users, and inadvertently affect the situation for others. During a sustained cascade, the downwards price pressure on BNT can move the market farther from equilibrium with each iteration.\n6. Taken to its natural conclusion, those leaving in a panic would have trampled those who were slower to react, or simply remained patient.\n\nDuring the week leading to the emergency decision, the following actions and protocol behavior were observed:\n\n1. A clear pattern in which big withdrawals were made, received BNT compensation and immediately sold the BNT tokens leading to suppression of the BNT price.\n2. A growing short position on the token as evidenced by the open interest on FTX and OKEx, that happened to coincide with these withdrawals, suggesting an opportunist was seeking to benefit from the oncoming cascade.\n\nThe forecasted effects in a worst case scenario for Bancor liquidity providers, and the protocol itself, were severe enough to warrant an emergency intervention. It should be highlighted that Bancor V3 already has changed behavior to V2.1, and many of its features were not given sufficient time to take effect. However, the lack of resilience to a mass-panic event is underscored, and mechanisms to protect the system from similar market conditions in the future will be required at the smart contract-level.\n\n# The Threat Identified\n\nThe Bancor Network offers its liquidity providers impermanent loss insurance, in return for a portion of the trading fees earned on the protocol. The impermanent loss insurance mechanism operates by reimbursing apparent losses with the BNT token, while offsetting the inflationary costs realized by destroying BNT, paid with fees collected over time.\n\nA series of events transpired that undermined the time assumption, and challenged the notion of a market at equilibrium. Some of the largest rewards accumulators disposed of the tokens hastily and irresponsibly very recently, into a market that was ill-equipped to handle the selling pressure. This created a fast deficit on the protocol with respect to its impermanent-loss protected evaluations of user positions.\n\nTherefore, at the time of intervention there was a significant relative deficit for major tokens on the Bancor protocol, and a large number of active withdrawals in cooldown. Under these conditions, the impermanent loss insurance mechanism was expected to have produced a runaway effect. The large relative proportion of the TVL of the network departing in a short time period, as projected from the withdrawals in active cooldown, had a very credible and substantial risk of resulting in an unsustainable cycle. As the relative balance of BNT inside the network continues to increase, the number of BNT tokens required to compensate liquidity providers also increases. This feedback loop had an unacceptably high probability of coming to fruition, which would have threatened not only user funds, but the protocol as such.\n\n# The Emergency Actions Taken\n\nThe protocol’s BNT minting capability with respect to the insurance mechanism was paused, effectively halting the feedback loop and preventing the runaway effects. In addition, the following protective measures were implemented:\n\n1. Deposits were disabled across the protocol. This measure prevents users from participating in liquidity provision while the protocol is in a stressed state.\n2. Withdrawals from V2.1 require migration to v3 first. This measure prevents a complex contract upgrade for the V2.1 system that would have required a longer development process, and increased the likelihood of bugs and unpredictable behavior.\n3. Withdrawals from v3 remain active, with the following modification: BNT compensation is no longer provided at withdrawal. Therefore users may withdraw their pro-rata share of the vault balance in the TKN denomination of their pool token.\n\nTherefore users may withdraw while the system remains in the paused state without receiving BNT.\n\nThese measures were implemented as temporary emergency measures to remain in effect until the DAO votes on this proposal. If this proposal is approved, the protective measures will remain in place for now, to protect the protocol until a longer-term technical solution is proposed and approved by the Bancor DAO. The community is actively investigating solutions to reactivate IL insurance; these solutions will ultimately be proposed to the DAO in order to be implemented.\n\nIf this proposal is not approved, the protective measures will be rolled-back at the conclusion of the vote, without any other protective measures in place.\n\n# The Ratification Proposal\n\nThis proposal asks the BancorDAO to ratify continuing the emergency measures put in place on 19th June, 2022, to protect the protocol from harm until a longer-term solution is proposed. If successful:\n\n1. Deposits will remain disabled across the protocol.\n2. Withdrawals from V2.1 will continue to require migration to V3 first.\n3. Withdrawals from V3 remain active, without BNT distribution. Withdrawals are pro-rata with respect to the vault balance in the TKN denomination of the pool token.\n\nIf unsuccessful:\n\n1.

The result of this program would be trading a high ‘APR’ in the UI for a reduced price of BNT. Understand that this APR is not real, it is simply diluting ourselves and the value of BNT. If we did this, we would be putting additional strain on the Bancor Protocol as the price of BNT goes down - increasing the impermanent loss in every pool. \n\nIt’s time to completely remove unhealthy liquidity mining rewards.

The schedule will be 40% burn rate immediately, 70% after 1 week, and move to 100% after 2 weeks.\nNext, increase the vortex burn to 30% on version 3. This should be done immediately. \n\nReasoning:\n1. LPs earning fees is of lower importance right now, but volatility is high and this represents a shared opportunity for the protocol and users.\n2. There are no fees if Bancor doesn't survive.\n3. Burning more vBNT counters inflationary risk. We need this now.\n4. Using the vortex to market buy BNT is good for ALL Bancor users.\n5. This action may help to restore user confidence. \n6. This may help counter the coordinated shorts against BNT.\n\nWe can collect and analyze data from the vortex increases and adjust if needed.

Utilizing arUSD, users can swap between a variety of synthetic cryptocurrencies and LP tokens and farm on synthetic yield farms that track the APR of their native chain counterparts.\n\nAvalanche is our first home, but we'll quickly expand to other networks and join Cosmos with our own blockchain solution.\n\n\n# Token Utility\n\nThe ACRE token is currently a governance token for Arable Protocol and can be further utilized as such: \n\n\n\n* collateral for [minting arUSD](https://medium.com/@ArableProtocol/today-we-will-have-a-closer-look-at-the-role-of-minters-at-arable-35e2c39a0c87) (as part of MVP launch)\n* delegating to our [validators](https://app.arable.finance/#/validators)\n* single-sided [staking](https://app.arable.finance/#/staking/0x4bc722Cd3F7b29ae3A5e0a17a61b72Ea5020502B0x0)\n* LP liquidity mining ([here](https://app.arable.finance/#/pool/0x598EBAC38cF211749b1277c9a34d217226A476Af0x0) and [here](https://app.arable.finance/#/pool/0x598EBAC38cF211749b1277c9a34d217226A476Af0x02))\n\n\n# Community and Communication\n\nArable Protocol has vibrant communities on [Telegram](https://t.me/ArableProtocol) and [Discord](http://discord.gg/arable) and we regularly publish articles on [Medium](https://medium.com/@ArableProtocol) and keep connected with our followers on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ArableProtocol).\n\nView a complete list of our resources at our [linktr.ee](https://linktr.ee/arable_protocol).\n\n\n# Available Audits\n\n[SolidityFinance](https://solidity.finance/) is in the process of auditing our MVP contracts: [https://twitter.com/ArableProtocol/status/1532212566897750016](https://twitter.com/ArableProtocol/status/1532212566897750016)\n\nOur staking contracts have already been successfully audited: [Arable Staking Smart Contract Audit by Solidity Finance](https://github.com/ArableProtocol/arable-contracts-official/blob/main/audits/Arable%20Staking%20Smart%20Contract%20Audit%20by%20Solidity%20Finance.pdf)\n\n\n# Market and Trading Data\n\nCurrently, the following pools are in operation:\n\n\n\n* ACRE/WAVAX on Pangolin (Avalanche)\n* ACRE/USDT on Pangolin (Avalanche)\n* ACRE/PNG on Pangolin (Avalanche)\n* ACRE/MATIC on Quickswap (Polygon)\n\nWe are planning on getting listed on more DEXs on other chains and considering getting listed on centralized exchanges as well.\n\n\n<table>\n  <tr>\n   <td>ACRE price at the time of writing\n   </td>\n   <td>$0.0174\n   </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td>All-Time High\n   </td>\n   <td>$0.501675 (Feb 21, 2022)\n   </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td>All-Time Low\n   </td>\n   <td>$0.01705078 (May 27, 2022)\n   </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td>Price 90 days ago (from writing)\n   </td>\n   <td>$0.164688\n   </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td>ACRE tokens in circulation\n   </td>\n   <td>164,421,775\n   </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td>Maximum supply\n   </td>\n   <td>1000,000,000\n   </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td>Current market capitalization\n   </td>\n   <td>$2,858,912\n   </td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n\n\n\n# Benefits for Bancor and its Stakeholders\n\n\n\n* Increased transaction volume from ACRE users\n* Transaction fees from swaps\n* Locked ACRE in the IL protection vault\n* ACRE airdrop to BNT holders\n\nThe Bancor community will benefit by ACRE investment locked into the IL vault, and as a good-faith partnership action, an airdrop to all BNT holders.",

      "title": " Proposal: Whitelist Doubloon (DBL) on Bancor v3 ",
      "content": "For this proposal to pass, it requires a 35% quorum and 66.7% supermajority.\n\nThis proposal is expected to appear on Snapshot for voting on [date=2022-06-19 timezone=\"Europe/Lisbon\"]. Make sure to stake your vBNT for voting before this date and time to participate in the DAO decision.\n\n**Summary**\n\n* Proposal to whitelist $DBL for IL protection\n* Proposed co-investment of 50k $BNT\n* There are no apparent security concerns that would prohibit whitelist status\n* Galleon will provide 50,000 BNT worth of DBL tokens for external IL protection\n* There is no reason to doubt the legitimacy of the Galleon project\n\nDoubloon token address: https://arbiscan.io/token/0xd3f1da62cafb7e7bc6531ff1cef6f414291f03d3\n\nProject website: https://galleon.community\n\n**Token Security**\n\nThe Doubloon token is fixed supply at 100,000,000 and the current circulating supply is:\n\nThe largest holders consist of 15% team wallet, 20% seed investors (23 total parties) and 65% community-owned DAO which are all linearly vested over a 3 year period.\n \n![image](ipfs://QmPHKupwzeKqGTcMY8vC4HTGJCeXixmhLCSMz7iz4VzVYo)\n    \nVesting tokens are released from January 2022 to January 2025 based on the following schedule:\n \n![image](ipfs://QmQmECZKJiiH9k45Yj4hNr6jFPqpUzJLMMGXa6GC9wHmGE)\n\nThe DBL token contracts do not appear to grant administrators unrestricted mint/burn permissions.\n\nProject\n\nGalleon was formed in February 2022 by Andrew from Set following our small $1m seed raise in January to launch and manage on-chain structured products.\n\nCurrently, our flagship product: The ETH Max Yield Index ($ETHMAXY) was the first stETH/ETH recursive lending product in the market with ATH TVL of $5m+ which generates revenue via its 1.95% streaming fee.\n\nWe have another 2-3 products currently being built, which include (but are not limited to):\n\n* a new recursive lending product\n* a new yield basis product\n* And a sector indices\n\nAll products are based on the Set Protocol smart contracts and generate income by charging holders a streaming fee. Additional issuance and redemption fees can be applied, however, Galleon at current does not have any deployed products that utilise these extra fees.\n\nGalleon currently has $2.2m AUM with zero being incentivised by Galleon liquidity mining or staking. Daily income fluctuates, but total cumulative income since February 2022 launch is $20k.\n\nGalleon is still very new to the structured product space being only 3-4 months old, however, we have already shown our capability with our Optimistic Governance model enabling us to identify market narratives (like recursive lending) and being first to market with innovative structured products. We also had a complete branding overhaul that dropped at the beginning of May.\n\n**Tokenomics**\n\nThe DBL token is currently a pure governance token for Galleon, nor are there any burn mechanisms in place. DBL is based on the ERC20 standard.\n\nAt this time, other than LPing with the risk of IL, there are no productive ways to use the DBL tokens (i.e. single side staking, use as collateral.)\n\n**Community and Communication**\n\nGalleons' main internal activity is on [discord](https://discord.gg/galleondao) and [discourse](https://court.galleon.community/) with reference [docs](https://docs.galleon.community/) (which we are currently in the process of moving to our notion [page](https://galleon.notion.site/Welcome-to-Galleon-3a8c6ddbc8794c05bed8d1a7fac0bb85)) and [snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/galleondao.eth) voting for GIPs. There is also [Twitter](https://twitter.com/galleondao) and [medium](https://blog.galleon.community/) channels. Galleon UI and smart contracts can be found on [Github](https://github.com/GalleonDAO).\n\nThere is also a [DuneAnalytics](https://dune.com/galleondao/ETHMAXY-KPIs) dashboard showing key metrics.\n\n**Available Audits**\n\nThe Galleon DAO farming contracts are based on forks from Uniswap with minimal changes and have not been audited.\n\nThe Set Protocol contracts have been audited by [ChainSecurity](https://www.setprotocol.com/pdf/chain_security_set_protocol_report.pdf?source=post_page---------------------------) and [Trail of Bits](https://www.setprotocol.com/pdf/trail_of_bits_set_protocol_report.pdf?source=post_page---------------------------).\n\n**Market and Trading Data**\n\n* DBL price at time of writing is $0.058\n* All-time high: $0.208386 (April 02, 2022)\n* All-time low: $0.04818511 (May 19, 2022)\n* Price 90 days ago: $0.114966\n* 21,395,553 tokens in circulation.\n* 100,000,000 maximum supply.\n* The current market capitalization is $1,230,822.\n* The DBL token is currently on MEXC exchange.\n* The majority of the volume is on Uniswap v3.\n\nOn-chain trade data:\n\nThere is currently only one 1 main liquidity pool with DBL/WETH trade volume on Arbitrum with liquidity primarily provisioned by the team. The Uniswap v3 pool is currently receiving incentives via xTokenTermimal and does not offer IL protection.\n\n**Benefits for Bancor:**\n\nAdding DBL as a whitelisted pool will allow DBL holders to make their DBL tokens productive while being protected from IL. As Galleon contributors are paid in DBL, this is an excellent way to attract the attention of a strong and active community.\n\nThe initial proposal is expected to create a pool equivalent to the AUM of the current v3 pool and lower fee for traders.\n\nGalleon will provide 50,000 BNT worth of DBL tokens for external IL protection.\n\nOur long term goal would be to work with the Galleon community to enable Bancor to feel confident in whitelisting potential existing and future Galleon products as they attract significantly more volume than DBL.\n",

      "content": "# This proposal is expected to appear on Snapshot on June 5th. If you want to participate in this decision, make certain that your vBNT is staked for voting prior to the commencement of the voting period.\n\n# TL;DR\n\n* The BancorDAO recently approved a diminishing emissions schedule for [USDT](https://gov.bancor.network/t/proposal-bancor-3-liquidity-mining-rewards-in-the-usdt-pool/3584), [USDC](https://gov.bancor.network/t/proposal-bancor-3-liquidity-mining-rewards-in-the-usdc-pool/3583), [DAI](https://gov.bancor.network/t/proposal-bancor-3-liquidity-mining-rewards-in-the-dai-pool/3585), [LINK](https://gov.bancor.network/t/proposal-bancor-3-liquidity-mining-rewards-in-the-link-pool/3582), [ETH ](https://gov.bancor.network/t/proposal-bancor-3-liquidity-mining-rewards-in-the-eth-pool/3581)and [wBTC](https://gov.bancor.network/t/proposal-bancor-3-liquidity-mining-rewards-in-the-wbtc-pool/3580) (colloquially referred to as the “primordial pools”).\n* This proposal seeks to repeal these decisions, and effectively cancel the inflationary rewards schedule for these tokens.\n* Instead, the same emissions budget is proposed to be redistributed exclusively to BNT stakers - a total of 980,000 BNT over a six-month period.\n\n# Clarification\n\n* The other established programs remain unaffected:\n  * The once only, 50,000 BNT “dual rewards” program, which creates an incentive for other projects to use the Bancor 3 autocompounding feature is unaffected. This program has been previously established, and maintained by governance with the evolving Bancor 3 deployment schedule. The [most recent](https://snapshot.org/#/bancornetwork.eth/proposal/0x8fd495a126e3e6633977c2189b2ef5e028a3f632b375e5f56cf29d82eb3e27e3) addendum, approved via Snapshot voting, imposes a deadline of August 31st for projects seeking to use the program.\n  * The [BIP18: Proposed Bancor 3 Liquidity Mining Program](https://gov.bancor.network/t/bip18-proposed-bancor-3-liquidity-mining-program/3500) established the BNT autocompounding schedule, and the overall BNT emissions budget into the future.\n\n# Motivation\n\n* The motivation for this effective repeal is that the standard rewards contracts were not designed to support this type of incentives system. The “dual rewards” program was envisioned as being the main, perhaps the only use case.\n* The misuse of the standard rewards contracts has the following issues:\n  * The liquidity providers in these pools seldom keep their BNT. It is the opinion of the author of this proposal that the stress on the BNT token caused by the rewards programs on these pools is unnecessary, and ultimately harmful.\n  * The user experience is already compromised. Due to the short duration, and number of standard rewards contracts required to facilitate the schedule outlined in the proposals being repealed here, users are required to perform multiple tasks, including recurring stake/unstake actions.\n* User confusion and frustration, and degradation of the BNT token, culminates in a situation that is decidedly worse than simply having no emissions at all.\n\n# Refocus on Sustainability\n* It is the opinion of the author of this proposal that liquidity mining emissions have run their course.\n  * Inflationary rewards programs are valuable in their ability to drive engagement, and further distribute the token.\n  * Rewards programs are not true yield.\n  * The longer we rely on BNT inflation to appease liquidity providers, the more we are contributing to the systemic misunderstanding of the value proposition of DeFi.\n* The version 2.1 rewards schedule could be viewed as the early adopter advantage - something which is only valuable if the early adoption period is ultimately concluded.\n* Bancor 3 is highly competitive, regardless of inflation rates. It has become part of the Bancor community culture to assume that inflationary tactics are necessary (they aren’t) and that liquidity will flee from the system en masse immediately (it won’t).\n* The longer the community continues to lean into the inflation paradigm, the more our project is conflated with low-brow yield farming and “ponzi” tokenomics, which erodes the reputation of the project and its community.\n\n# Bancor 3 BNT Stakers Advantage\n\n* The economic impact of distributing BNT back to those already participating in the network with their own BNT is muted compared to those participating with TKN (non-BNT).\n* Since the BancorDAO has already approved the emissions for 980,000 BNT back to network participants, this proposal seeks to reallocate that same amount with a standard rewards contract for bnBNT instead of bnTKN.\n* Further, this proposal seeks to establish the following points, which may be referred to in future governance conversations, but aren’t a binding aspect of this proposal:\n  * The standard rewards contracts used to incentivise BNT stakers is a temporary measure only.\n  * The autocompounding mechanics are superior in every regard; after the relevant contracts are deployed, and the network is stable enough to commence their operation, there is no reason to ever use the standard rewards contracts to incentivise the BNT community itself ever again.\n  * The standard rewards contracts are a bootstrapping tool; to consider BNT inflation as a means to maintain participation on the protocol - BNT and TKN liquidity providers alike - is a cheap and dangerous paradigm, and has no place in an informed conversation about the utility or value proposition of Bancor 3.\n  * All BNT emissions to anyone, including BNT stakers, is paid for by BNT stakers eventually. There is no free lunch - if you give away tokens for free, you can’t act surprised when others value it accordingly.\n* Therefore, the creation of a six-month staking contract is in-line with the community expectation.\n\n# BNT Standard Rewards Contract: Conditions\n\n* The proposed 980,000 BNT emissions distributed via a standard rewards contract to BNT stakers will commence after the whitelisting process has completed.\n* Therefore:\n  * The emissions rates towards the aforementioned tokens ceases immediately.\n  * Emissions towards BNT stakers via the proposed standard rewards contract will not commence immediately, and has no fixed commencement date as of this proposal.\n  * Rather, the commencement of the standard rewards contract for BNT stakers is defined as being the period of time following the on-boarding of the whitelist from v2.1, with the following guidelines:\n    * The protocol holdings of bnBNT are sufficient to on-board no less than 90% of the remaining BNT from v2.1.\n    * The entire token whitelist is supported on Bancor 3, with at least 50 pools having completed the bootstrapping procedure, and available for trading.\n    * This is critical both from a protocol health perspective, and also from a user experience perspective, as the rush to participate in Bancor 3 to collect these inflationary tokens may outpace the underlying utility of the network while the protocol is still in its establishing phase.\n\n# Voting Instructions\nVote FOR to repeal the prior decisions on USDT, USDC, DAI, ETH, wBTC and LINK, effectively nullifying BNT emissions on these tokens indefinitely, and reallocating the recently approved 980,000 BNT incentives budget exclusively towards BNT stakers over a six-month period.\n\nVote AGAINST to uphold the prior DAO decision to use a total of 36 separate rewards contracts to support a diminishing emissions rate on USDT, USDC, DAI, ETH, wBTC and LINK over a 6 month period, with no changes to the incentives model for BNT.\n\n",

      "title": "Proposal Addendum: Incentivize users to migrate to v3 by matching token side LM rewards with up to 50k BNT per pool",
      "content": "TL;DR\n\n* In Bancor 3, external token projects can incentivise their own communities by providing liquidity incentives in their own TKN.\n* To garner fast adoption, bring awareness to the External Liquidity Mining rewards tool, and lubricate the transition from Bancor v2.1 to Bancor 3, this proposal seeks to match the external team’s liquidity mining incentives in dollar value at the time of token commitment, up to a maximum of 50k BNT, emitted over a 24 months schedule.\n* The matched BNT will be emitted over a 24 months schedule. The 2-year duration is chosen with a long-term view in mind.\n* Bancor 3 launched on 5/11/22 in a limited capacity, with 4 pools (BNT/DAI/LINK/ETH). The remaining pools will be deployed as part of https://gov.bancor.network/t/proposal-complete-token-migration-to-v3/3624. Therefore, to provide enough time for projects and teams to deploy tokens and participate in the Dual LM Rewards program, an extension to the cut-off date is being proposed.\n\n### Procedure (To start around end of June/early July)\nThe cut off date of 8/31/22 is the date by which projects need to:\n\n1. Project needs to stake TKN into their pool and receive bnTKN\n2. Project needs to stake bnTKN into the auto compounding vault\n\nAdditionally, the following steps will take place after the above is completed:\n\n1. Message the Bancor team with the specific details about their program (start date, emission pace per second, etc)\n2. Bancor DAO msig sets the program in the contract\n3. Every vortex burn will trigger the auto compounding burn and transfer value to other bnTKN holders\n\n### External Liquidity Mining feature\n\nLiquidity Mining is a convenient tool to bootstrap liquidity with proven results. Figure 1 and 2 show the WOO pool balance increasing significantly after LM rewards were activated, and finally stabilising at a higher TVL than before the program started. Figure 3 shows the Liquidity Share for the FARM pool increasing once LM rewards were activated, and stabilising at higher values.\n\n\n![image](ipfs://QmezmxGPweVpCW6kzNZ7LXeGUZtjozCqnbrsvLgqRMSJ8P)\nFigure 1 - WOO pool balance over time. LM rewards started at the end of May 2021.\n\n![image](ipfs://QmQG7B5YwW53VnqwyQ8xg6kGUhs1d6i3VNfQ9toyfpro2W)\nFigure 2 - FARM pool balance over time. LM rewards started at the end of July.\n\n![image](ipfs://QmTJ6ubD5ZpC79uQ9jkgcqK1HUYPW3CZcTPHrpcScLz8NR)\nFigure 3 - FARM Liquidity Share on Ethereum.\n\nMatching the rewards on TKN with BNT rewards means less BNT is needed for Liquidity Mining than v2.1.\n\nSince the announcement of Bancor 3, there has been strong interest among white-listed tokens to offer LM rewards. Migration to Bancor 3 can be achieved in a single click via the Bancor app. The liquidity incentives discussed here are an important component in stimulating users to migrate from v2.1 to Bancor 3.\n\nTo accelerate the adoption, and help raise awareness for this feature, for each white-listed token that commits to their own auto-compounding rewards program, the BancorDAO will match the emissions value up to a maximum of 50k BNT.\n\nThere is no requirement that the token and BNT LM be on the same emission schedule; however, the BNT emissions will be non-negotiable and fixed over a 24-month period.\n\nTo receive the BNT rewards, LPs need to stake their LP tokens in a rewards contract. Decision on the rewards emission schedule is purposely open-ended and will be proposed and decided at a later stage by the BancorDAO.\n\nIn conclusion, the Dual LM rewards program seeks to:\n\n* Incentivise LPs to migrate from Bancor v2.1 to Bancor 3.\n* Increase awareness of the External Liquidity Mining feature.\n* Attract more LPs from different communities to stake on Bancor and get familiarised with Bancor3 features.\n* The BNT emission schedule has a long-term view in mind.\n\nFOR\n\nAccept the addendum to move the cut-off date from the end of May 2022 to the end of August 2022.\n\nAGAINST\n\nContinue with the previous dual LM rewards proposal with a cut-off date at the end of May 2022.\n",

The remaining free liquidity balance will be made available for liquidity providers (LP) who wish to stake & participate in our LM campaign.\n* The MFG liquidity balance is currently near full.\n\n![image](ipfs://QmTVHvo7JznpC8gcMSPwtR23b29LY3Q5UzNDX9Vt4cNGbT)\n\n* The MFG liquidity on other decentralized exchanges justifies proposing an increase.\n* Increasing the pool’s liquidity will improve price impact and help direct more volume to Bancor.\n* This proposal seeks to increase the trading liquidity limit in the pool from 400k BNT to 800k BNT.\n* This proposal also seeks to update the fee tier to 1%.\n* Smart MFG will incentivise the MFG pool on Bancor v3 with liquidity mining rewards.\n* We will also redirect or inform/promote this new LM campaign on our dashboard at https://rewards.smartmfg.io/. Current Uni v3 campaign ended in March and Smart MFG will prepare for the LM campaign after the release of Bancor v3. Official thread announcement found here: https://twitter.com/MFGcoin/status/1509300650970017793?s=20&t=oa2ubZoV8U_4pkkT1doBMg\n\n**Rationale**\n\nThe Deepest MFG pools are:\n* The MFG/ETH 1% Uniswap v3 pool with $275k liquidity, and $23k daily volume [1].\n\n* The MFG/USDC 1% Uniswap v3 pool with $4.68k liquidity, and $0 daily volume [2].\n\n* The MFG/DAI 1% Uniswap v3 pool with $264.84 liquidity, and $0 daily volume [3].\n\n* The MFG 0.3% Bancor v2.1 pool with $988,956 liquidity, and $$9,008 daily volume [4].\n\nThe extra liquidity would bring the total pool liquidity to at least ~$2,000,000, if the space in the pool is filled. If this happens, a proposal to increase the trading liquidity limit again should be considered.\n\n**FOR**\n1. Increase trading liquidity in the MFG pool from 400k BNT to 800k BNT.\n\n2. Set/Update Fee Tier to 1%.\n\n**AGAINST**\n1. Keep the trading liquidity in the MFG pool at 400k BNT.\n\n2. Keep existing Fee Tier\n\n[1] https://info.uniswap.org/#/pools/0x3c8e1997d9f93c989d4d7660b6ca52c451ad7554\n\n[2] https://info.uniswap.org/#/pools/0x27d02cfdf949447ccfe4d5a5dcb9c40aaf4ad7c4\n\n[3] https://info.uniswap.org/#/pools/0x3df3e64075243d35f3b60551e0fbd4c1ef3b9752\n\n[4] [Bancor: Converter 638 | Address 0x349419BcE4181d7D223442Fa48Ba9e611173A745 | Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/address/0x349419BcE4181d7D223442Fa48Ba9e611173A745)",

      "content": "# TL;DR\n\n* Proposal to whitelist CROWN\n* Trading liquidity limit of 100,000 BNT\n* Crown Capital will provide 50,000 BNT worth of CROWN tokens for external IL protection\n* There are no apparent security concerns that would prohibit whitelist status - you can see the results of the audit performed by Certik [here](https://www.certik.com/projects/crown-capital) (audit is complete but still waiting final report)\n* There is no reason to doubt the legitimacy of the Crown Capital project\n* Crown would only be added as a Bancor v3 pool once all pools have been enabled\n\nCrown token address:\n\n[0x444d6088B0F625f8C20192623B3C43001135E0fa](https://etherscan.io/address/0x444d6088B0F625f8C20192623B3C43001135E0fa)\n\nProject Website: [https://www.crowncapital.games/](https://www.crowncapital.games/)\n\n# Project\n\nCrown Capital provides index-like exposure to the upcoming wave of blockchain gaming. The Crown DAO manages a fund that invests exclusively in yield-generating gaming NFTs. The DAO operates under the leadership of an elected board of governors, who are required to be doxxed.\n\nCrown has many unique traits that make it a favorable investment vehicle in the world of gaming NFTs. Some of these traits include:\n\n* The fund will continuously reinvest earnings.\n* Crown tokens might be more favorable for tax purposes than managing NFTs yourself, depending on your tax jurisdiction.\n* Crown sources and analyzes investment opportunities as a collective.\n* The Crown treasury will hold a basket of assets, giving you index-like exposure to the market.\n\n# Token Security & Tokenomics\n\nCrown does not have an elastic supply or rebase mechanism. The Crown contracts do not have permissions that grant administrators unrestricted mint/burn capabilities. The project has been audited by Certik, which you can see [here](https://www.certik.com/projects/crown-capital), however, the final report is still pending as of writing this.\n\nThe Crown token supply is fixed at 100,000,000, of which 8,762,456 are in circulation at the time of writing. Of the supply, up to 15% will be sold in total in the Pre Seed or Seed round sales, 10% is reserved for the DAO’s treasury, and 75% will be used as rewards distribution over 5 years. The contracts and addresses with the highest concentration of Crown tokens are the DAO multi-sig and the token rewards address (85% of all tokens).\n\nCurrently Crown has completed its Pre Seed round. Next up is its Seed round. All fundraising phases have been/are open to anyone who wants to participate - there has not been any exclusivity to any of the phases.\n\n![image](ipfs://QmQZVGMar3x6B4NJufoNhH1SCGojHB35NZ3dZyGnrnxk7s)\n\nYou can see the current CROWN holders here:\n\n[https://etherscan.io/token/0x444d6088B0F625f8C20192623B3C43001135E0fa#balances](https://etherscan.io/token/0x444d6088B0F625f8C20192623B3C43001135E0fa#balances)\n\nPlease note that as of this writing, the only holders are participants in the Pre Seed round - we hope and expect additional distribution of tokens in the Seed round.\n\n# Token Liquidity\n\nCrown currently does not have a liquid market. If this proposal passes, Bancor would be its primary source of Crown liquidity.\n\n# Community and Communication\n\nThe primary communication for the Crown DAO is over Discord.\n\nHere is a list of channels:\n\n* Discord: [https://discord.gg/zdh7hE5Q ](https://discord.gg/zdh7hE5Q)\n* Website: [https://www.crowncapital.games/](https://www.crowncapital.games/)\n* Twitter: [https://twitter.com/crowncapitaldao?s=20&t=skZfMu_kyr6qns8wf7w8pA](https://twitter.com/crowncapitaldao?s=20&t=skZfMu_kyr6qns8wf7w8pA)\n\n# Benefits for Bancor\n\nCrown will provide its own IL protection, with a commitment of CROWN tokens worth half the size of the proposed trading liquidity - 50,000 BNT.\n\nCrown hopes to run its reward program through Bancor. This includes 75% of the token supply being emitted over 5 years.\n\n# External IL Schedule\nThe Crown DAO proposes a schedule, where after 1 year, 75% of unused external IL tokens are returned to the Crown DAO multisig.",

      "title": "Proposal Addendum: Incentivize users to migrate to V3 by matching token side LM rewards with up to 50,000 BNT per pool. Availabl",
      "content": "This proposal is expected to appear on Snapshot for voting on\nSunday. Make sure to stake your vBNT for voting before this date and time to participate in the DAO decision.\n\n## TL;DR\n\n* In Bancor 3, external token projects can incentivise their own communities by providing liquidity incentives in their own TKN.\n* To garner fast adoption, bring awareness to the External Liquidity Mining rewards tool, and lubricate the transition from Bancor v2.1 to Bancor 3, this proposal seeks to match external team’s liquidity mining incentives in dollar value at the time of token commitment, up to a maximum of 50,000 BNT, emitted over a 24 months schedule.\n* The matched BNT will be emitted over a 24 months schedule. The 2-year duration is chosen with a long term view in mind.\n* Bancor 3 launched on the 11th of May in a limited capacity, with 3 pools + BNT. The remaining pools will be deployed as soon as protocol security assessment allows it. Therefore, to provide enough time for projects and teams to deploy tokens and participate in the Dual LM Rewards program, an extension to the cut-off date is being proposed.\n\n## External Liquidity Mining feature\n\nLiquidity Mining is a convenient tool to bootstrap liquidity with proven results. Figure 1 and 2 show the WOO pool balance increasing significantly after LM rewards were activated, and finally stabilising at a higher TVL than before the program started. Figure 3 shows the Liquidity Share for the FARM pool increasing once LM rewards were activated, and stabilising at higher values.\n\n![image](ipfs://Qmb1HYt7ncghoAMbqW4pydtCrNo27Riut8pCtyMwxmXd5P)\n\nFigure 1 - WOO pool balance over time. LM rewards started at the end of May 2021.\n\n![image](ipfs://QmRvMMqbYP9XuqiNVX7nkD5rNNpeJ9zt3i8X7gHhwDoN9w)\n\nFigure 2 - FARM pool balance over time. LM rewards started at the end of July.\n\n![image](ipfs://QmP3v2d1wi1g4oFjiDJoPLv8MMmGpVMdgdpkn7PrSk5hUW)\n\nFigure 3 - FARM Liquidity Share on Ethereum.\n\nMatching the rewards on TKN with BNT rewards means that less BNT is needed for Liquidity Mining compared to v2.1.\n\nSince the announcement of Bancor 3, there has been strong interest among white listed tokens to offer LM rewards. Migration to Bancor 3 can be achieved in a single click via the Bancor app. The liquidity incentives discussed here are an important component in stimulating users to migrate from v2.1 to Bancor 3.\n\nTo accelerate the adoption, and help raise awareness for this feature, for each white listed token that commits to their own auto-compounding rewards program, the BancorDAO will match the emissions value up to a maximum of 50,000 BNT.\n\nThere is no requirement that the token and BNT LM be on the same emission schedule; however, the BNT emissions will be non-negotiable and fixed over a 24-month period.\n\nTo receive the BNT rewards, LPs need to stake their LP tokens in a rewards contract. Decision on the rewards emission schedule is purposely open-ended and will be proposed and decided at a later stage by the BancorDAO.\n\nIn conclusion, the Dual LM rewards program seeks to:\n\n* Incentivise LPs to migrate from Bancor v2.1 to Bancor 3.\n* Increase awareness of the External Liquidity Mining feature.\n * Attract more LPs from different communities to stake on Bancor and get familiarised with Bancor3 features.\n* The BNT emission schedule has a long-term view in mind.\n\nFOR\n\nAccept the addendum to move the cut-off date from the end of May 2022 to the end of June 2022.\n\nAGAINST\n\nContinue with the previous dual LM rewards proposal with a cut-off date at the end of May 2022.",

Additionally, a standard rewards program is proposed on the BNT pool.\n\nVoting AGAINST this proposal supports the requirement for all 150+ whitelisted tokens to become available immediately at the conclusion of the Beta testing program.\n\n### Summary\nThe Bancor DAO recently passed a proposal to end the Bancor 3 Beta.\n\nThis new proposal proposes that upon the release of V3, V3 starts with only the ETH, LINK, DAI and BNT pools that were included in the Beta.\n\nThe reason is simple. Security. Security is the most important aspect of the Bancor Protocol.\n\nThis will give additional time to researchers, DAO members and white hats to continue to monitor V3 and highlight anything unexpected.\n\nIt is for this reason that it is proposed to release V3 without any limits on those pools and continue to monitor until another proposal is posted in the coming days/weeks to release all other whitelisted pools.\n\nAnyone who has been in DeFi and Crypto for any significant amount of time will understand the risks that the Bancor DAO is seeking to protect itself and LPs from.\n\n### Auto Compounding\nIn order for BNT auto compounding rewards to be live, the protocol needs to own a sufficient amount of BNT (which are acquired when tokens are staked by users).\n\nWith a slower pool release schedule, this is likely an impossible program until more pools are added following a subsequent proposal.\n\nIn order to ensure an efficient migration of BNT liquidity, this proposal proposes that a total of 35,000 BNT be used for a standard rewards program running for 1 month.",

Multiple projects have shown interest in the program, and several DAOs have passed and ongoing proposals to participate in the program by committing DAO TKN funds, such as the Wootrade, Paraswap, 88MPH, and APWine DAOs.\n6. Given points 3 and 4 and with the sustainability of BNT emissions in mind, this proposal seeks to create a LM program with decaying BNT emissions in the wBTC pool.\n7. The proposed budget for the LM rewards on the ETH, wBTC, LINK, USDC, USDT and DAI pools for the first 6 months of Bancor 3 is 10% of the LM budget, 1m BNT.\n8. The BNT rewards allocation schedule for the wBTC pool is detailed in Table 1.\n9. wBTC pool’s weekly volume and fees are shown below in Figures 1 and 2.\n10. Bancor 3 will introduce additional use cases for the liquidity in the pools, with flashloans being the first one, in order to generate additional yield for LPs.

New wBTC LM programs, as well as modifications and extensions to the Liquidity Mining program described herein can be proposed to the DAO in the future.\n\n## Voting Instructions\n\nFOR\n\nStart LM rewards on the wBTC pool, at the rate described in Table 1, after the full launch of Bancor 3.\n\nAGAINST\n\nDo not approve this LM program.

USDC is the 4th deepest pool on Bancor with $24,965,852 in liquidity (3% of Bancor v2.1’s TVL).\n2.

Multiple projects have shown interest in the program, and several DAOs have passed and ongoing proposals to participate in the program by committing DAO TKN funds, such as the Wootrade, Paraswap, 88MPH, and APWine DAOs.\n6. Given points 3 and 4 and with the sustainability of BNT emissions in mind, this proposal seeks to create a LM program with decaying BNT emissions in the USDC pool.\n7. The proposed budget for the LM rewards on the ETH, wBTC, LINK, USDC, USDT and DAI pools for the first 6 months of Bancor 3 is 10% of the LM budget, 1m BNT.\n8.

      "title": "Proposal: Bancor 3 Liquidity Mining Rewards in the ETH Pool",
      "content": "To pass, this proposal needs 35% quorum and 80% supermajority.\n\n## TL;DR\n\n* As stated in the previous[ ETH Liquidity Mining Extension](https://gov.bancor.network/t/proposal-extension-of-liquidity-mining-rewards-on-the-eth-pool-ahead-of-bancor-3/3508/2) proposal, the rewards in the ETH pool on Bancor v2.1 shall end with the full launch of Bancor 3.\n* To bootstrap ETH liquidity and incentivise migration to Bancor 3, this proposal details a Liquidity Mining program with decaying emissions for the ETH pool which will last for 6 months.\n* Bancor V3 has proposed a total budget of 10,000,000 BNT to be used to incentivize stakers on the token side.\n* This total budget reflects the importance of transition away from large amounts of BNT emissions.\n* This proposal seeks to use 360,000 of those to incentive ETH in the months following the launch.\n\n## Discussion\n\n1. ETH is the 2nd deepest pool on Bancor with $232,003,201 in liquidity (25% of Bancor v2.1’s TVL).\n2. Sustaining liquidity in the ETH pool is essential to maintain the position of the Bancor protocol on the market.\n3. The ETH pool daily APR from fees (without BNT rewards) in the last month is shown in Figure 3.\n4. The BancorDAO approved[ BIP18](https://gov.bancor.network/t/bip18-proposed-bancor-3-liquidity-mining-program/3500) which details the Bancor 3 Liquidity Mining Program with a budget of 10m BNT for Liquidity Mining Rewards on TKN pools for the lifetime of Bancor 3.\n5. The[ Dual Liquidity Mining Program](https://gov.bancor.network/t/proposal-addendum-incentivize-users-to-migrate-to-v3-by-matching-token-side-lm-rewards-with-up-to-50-000-bnt-per-pool-available-once-per-pool-offer-open-until-the-end-of-may-2022/3512) aims to incentivise migration and bootstrap liquidity on Bancor 3. Multiple projects have shown interest in the program, and several DAOs have passed and ongoing proposals to participate in the program by committing DAO TKN funds, such as the Wootrade, Paraswap, 88MPH, and APWine DAOs.\n6. Given points 3 and 4 and with the sustainability of BNT emissions in mind, this proposal seeks to create a LM program with decaying BNT emissions in the ETH pool.\n7. The proposed budget for the LM rewards on the ETH, wBTC, LINK, USDC, USDT and DAI pools for the first 6 months of Bancor 3 is 10% of the LM budget, 1m BNT.\n8. The BNT rewards allocation schedule for the ETH pool is detailed in Table 1.\n9. ETH pool’s weekly volume and fees are shown below in Figures 1 and 2.\n10. Bancor 3 will introduce additional use cases for the liquidity in the pools, with flashloans being the first one, in order to generate additional yield for LPs. Other internal strategies to utilize the liquidity in the pools will be introduced in the next phases of Bancor 3.\nTable 1 - Proposed Liquidity Mining Rewards in the ETH pool (BNT)\n\n|Token|Month 1|Month 2|Month 3|Month 4|Month 5|Month 6|Total|\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|ETH|100000|80000|60000|50000|40000|30000|360000|\n\n\n![image](ipfs://QmaByZasYfeEVejFBX23oQ5Gj8EV8rQcJxe6qBqwvnakEb)\nFigure 1 - Weekly ETH fees since the beginning of July.\n\n![image](ipfs://QmNMf49BgDrXxX8gKyCyHWBHcmZ7nJuKUFJRNoBg8Q4vEp)\nFigure 2 - Weekly ETH volume since the beginning of July.\n\n![image](ipfs://QmXkdtz3chtUVYYHsLMFcBBu8jpyXKi42bYVk6CJtbZ9qs)\nFigure 3 - Daily APR in the ETH pool since the beginning of April 2022.\n\n## Summary\n\n1. The Liquidity Mining Rewards in the ETH, wBTC, LINK, USDT, USDC, and DAI pools will end with the full launch of Bancor 3.\n2. With the sustainability of BNT rewards in mind and considering the approved LM budget within BIP18 as well as the Dual LM program’s potential expenditure, a BNT LM rewards emission of 1m BNT over 6 months for the 6 pools mentioned above is proposed, with decaying emissions each month.\n3.

      "title": "Proposal to onboard PDI with 100k BNT trading limit",
      "content": "### TL;DR\n\n* Proposal to whitelist PDI (Phuture DeFi Index) before it launches on Ethereum mainnet\n* PDI offers exposure to the top crypto assets by market capitalisation in the decentralised finance sector, known as DeFi.\n* The proposed initial trading liquidity limit is 100k BNT\n* $25k in external IL protection in the form of PDI\n* There are no apparent security concerns that would prohibit whitelist status\n* Up to the equivalent of 50k BNT in PDI to be contributed for liquidity incentives with the equivalent value being matched by the Bancor joint rewards programme\n\n### Rationale\n\n#### The PDI token\n\nPDI marks the first index created by Phuture and begins our journey of working closely with Bancor to have all our products supported by the exchange. Our protocol has been audited by [Certik](https://www.certik.com/projects/phuture), Solidified and [C4](https://code4rena.com/contests/2022-04-phuture-finance-contest) and the reports for these audits will be available soon. In addition, the Bancor team have reviewed the token contract that is being used for all our index products and have confirmed it is fit for purpose. This is no surprise as the token contract is based on the standard erc-20 implementation. No issues have been found in our token contract across all our audits.\n\nThe token:\n\n* Is non upgradeable\n* Cannot be paused\n* Can only be minted if the minter brings the commensurate value for the amount being minted\n* Can only be redeemed (burned) by someone holding the token and is limited to the amount they hold\n* Contract is based on the standard OZ contracts\n* Token contract is viewable here:\nhttps://github.com/code-423n4/2022-04-phuture/blob/main/contracts/PhutureIndex.sol\n\nThe token is not yet live but our intentions are to be whitelisted on Bancor ahead of the launch so that we can build liquidity on Bancor from day one. Getting this proposal ratified prior to launch means we don't need to create a pool on another exchange whilst we wait for the proposal to get reviewed by the DAO.\n\n#### External IL\n\nWe are committed to providing $25k worth of PDI for external impermanent loss protection to help cover IL generated from PDI. Whilst we are happy to provide this amount of protection we believe that PDI will not suffer from huge IL costs. The reason being, that PDI is made up of the most mature and liquid tokens within DeFi and as a result is not subject to the initial price discovery that new tokens typically go through. Excess supply or demand on the index token itself will be corrected through the arbitrage loop that exists between the Bancor exchange and the Phuture platform. In fact, this arbitrage loop creates additional fees for LPs and acts as a consistent source of volume.\n\nAccording to Binance here is the impermanent loss suffered for a given percentage return:\n\n* 1.25x price change = 0.6% loss\n* 1.50x price change = 2.0% loss\n* 1.75x price change = 3.8% loss\n* 2x price change = 5.7% loss\n* 3x price change = 13.4% loss\n* 4x price change = 20.0% loss\n* 5x price change = 25.5% loss\n\nIf we look at the case where PDI doubles, that is the sum of the value of the DeFi tokens in the index in aggregate double, then a 5.7% IL would be suffered. Based on our external IL provision we could support a pool of approximately $440k. A pool of that size could potentially be supported if the entire trading limit we are asking for is taken up. This leads us to believe that this external IL fund should be sufficient in significantly reducing the burden of PDI on the Bancor protocol.\n\n#### Liquidity rewards\n\nPhuture intends to join Bancor’s incentive matching programme by supplying up to the equivalent of 50k BNT in PDI for liquidity rewards on the PDI pool, with the commensurate value being matched by Bancor. Given that Bancor is distributing the BNT rewards across a 2 year period, we intend to match this with our own rewards distribution. This will showcase Bancor’s auto compounding rewards allowing our investors to provide liquidity and receive additional rewards through one transaction.\n\nFOR\nOnboard PDI with 100k BNT trading limit, $25k external IL protection and the incentive matching programme\n\nAGAINST\n\nDon’t onboard PDI with 100k BNT trading limit, $25k external IL and up to the equivalent of $50k BNT in PDI rewards",

      "content": "# Voting instructions\n\nVote For to allow the Beta to end at 13:00 UTC, May 11 2022, +/- 24 hours, and for the rewards on v2.1 to end at 13:00 UTC, May 8 2022, +/- 24 hours.\n\nVote Against to allow the Beta to continue to 17th May 2022 and to leave the rewards program on v2.1 to remain unchanged.\n\n# TLDR\n\n* BIP16 authorized the Bancor 3 Beta test, which began on the 19th April.\n* The testing period was stipulated to continue for a maximum of 28 days, where the BancorDAO may elect to end the testing period early.\n* This proposal suggests ending the beta testing period within a 2-day window, defined as being 24 hours either side of 13:00 UTC May 11, 2022.\n* The Beta testing period includes restrictions on the TVL of the system, and a limited selection of token pairs, ETH, DAI and LINK.\n* The conclusion of the Beta testing period will remove all such restrictions, and open the system to deposits from the full range of DAO-approved, whitelisted tokens.\n* The Bancor 3 whitelist, including funding limits and trading fees was previously approved in BIP17.\n* Therefore, with the passing of this proposal, an “official launch” date for the full version of Bancor 3 will be established for the first time.\n\n# Important Note on Unclaimed v2.1 Rewards.\n\nThis proposal includes an end date for the rewards on v2.1. A snapshot of the blockchain will be taken, and any users with unclaimed rewards will be able to claim them again via a changed process on Bancor 3. The gas expense of claiming rewards after this interim period will be significantly reduced compared to v2.1.\n\n# Summary\n* The Beta program has been an outstanding success. The protocol has accumulated significant TVL, processed trades, and been subject to the scrutiny of the Ethereum community to discover bugs with up to a $1,000,000 bounty.\n* Minor problems have been identified, both due to internal monitoring systems, and as the result of professional audits - none of which have threatened user funds. Minor fixes have already been implemented, and others will be implemented with upcoming, planned contract upgrades, including and especially the 1-click migration support.\n* 3rd party integrations have already started.\n* The community can see the performance of the beta on-chain or on Dune (available in discussion link)\n* The revamped user interface for Bancor 3 is expected to be available by the proposed release date (May 11th).\n\n# V2.1 Rewards Program\n\nThe migration costs for users to move from V2.1 to V3 is greatly reduced by ending the rewards program on Bancor v2.1. Ending the rewards program and enabling migration involves multiple contract upgrades. To respect the labor, and monitoring requirements of the process, it is proposed that the rewards system on v2.1 be ended at 13:00 UTC, May 8 2022 +/- 24 hours. There will be a short interim period between the conclusion of the rewards program on v2.1, and the deployment of the new claims contract associated with the Bancor 3 release. This period where rewards will be unclaimable is expected to last 2-3 days.\nV3 Rewards Program Is Not Affected\n\nThis proposal has no effect on the rewards structure previously approved by the BancorDAO in BIP18 6, or the incentives program and its addenda concerning the dual-rewards system.",

If the pool is filled completely it will be roughly $756k in depth (with BNT at $2.16) and a proposal to increase the trading liquidity limit will be considered then.",

      "content": "The DAO has previously approved a rewards schedule, and capacity limits for the Beta testing period of Bancor 3, which are detailed in BIP16. It is important to remember the Beta has a singular purpose - to observe the behavior of the contracts in a real-world setting, and confirm the system is behaving precisely as described in the BIP15 document. \n\nThe TVL increases were proposed to increase in 4-day brackets, approaching a cumulative $63M target over 28 days. This proposal seeks to establish a slightly more pragmatic interpretation of the TVL schedule, that is, at best, ambiguous in the original wording of BIP16, and abjectly counter-productive to the objectives of the Beta testing period at worst.   \n\nCurrently\nThe TVL limit increases are expected to double at a singular moment in time, every 4 days. This can be expressed as:\n\n![flexibility 1.png](ipfs://QmVMvSnvCYjYeNWZwm57HPrhBF3BPGgPxeEMv4k1XZa9Bu)\n\nThe floor function in the exponent essentially means that the maximum capacity cannot be changed before the end of the 4-day cycle. \n\nRequested Leniency\nAs an exchange, it should come as no surprise that trading activity is an important aspect of the system that requires monitoring. Periods of low volatility, or to test the deposit logic during opportune periods in market movements, it can be advantageous to increase the capacity limits sooner. To this end, it is requested that the capacity limits can be increased within a cycle, to a maximum level defined by the lack of the floor in the exponent in the above expression: \n\n![flexibility 2.png](ipfs://QmVSxt2NCZEhn3jDugugbGrkv4MpjdJfp1sMAfCwAFoefW)\n\nIn other words, the capacity limits can be adjusted between the blue and the orange line in the following chart:\n\n![flexibility 3.png](ipfs://QmcGQxx713fdLgPDmrkhPHcmWPJXEffzHtjwPBHfWSmDsV)\n\nFOR\nAllow capacity limits to be increased within a cycle to the previously defined maximum at the end of each 4-day cycle.\n\nAGAINST\nDo nothing.\n",

This is possible because prizes are made up of the interest that accrues on all deposited funds.\n\n**The PoolTogether protocol has been live for over 2 years and distributed over $5 million in prizes to depositors.** [ **The luckiest winner so far deposited $74 and won over $40,000** ](https://decrypt.co/66354/crypto-no-loss-lottery-winner-turns-74-into-40000) **.** PoolTogether is one of the first and most widely used decentralized finance applications. It helps people save money by giving them the chance to win prizes.\n\n# Tokenomics\n\nIn February 2021, PoolTogether launched its native token called POOL. The token was created solely to govern the PoolTogether protocol, which makes it a governance token. Any changes or updates made to the protocol will be proposed and voted on by POOL token holders.\n\nAs we can see in the [POOL token contract](https://etherscan.io/token/0x0cEC1A9154Ff802e7934Fc916Ed7Ca50bDE6844e), the max supply is set to 10,000,000 POOL. According to this [PoolTogether blog post](https://medium.com/pooltogether/introducing-pool-23b09f36db48), the POOL token is being distributed to the community and contributors based on the following scheme:\n\n* 14% to all depositors up until January 14th, 2021 (17,072 unique addresses).\n* 12.44% to early core team contributors (locked for one year).\n* 7.52% to PoolTogether Inc investors (locked for one year).\n* 5% to a 14-week distribution to PoolTogether depositors (so that new users can get POOL governance tokens).\n* 2.5% to onboarding and education of new users.\n* 1% to addresses that voted in the first two snapshot governance votes AND held a PoolTogether deposit at the time of voting.\n\n![image](ipfs://QmfP6Smo5kHM4cxaGfbSapfYkiLFCDuvZWwmQB4hAJT8He)\n\nThe initial distribution accounts for 42.46% of the total supply. The remaining 57.54% is currently in the POOL Token Treasury, which will be used and distributed according to the token holders' proposals.\n\n# Community and Communication\n\nThe PoolTogether team operates an official [Twitter ](https://twitter.com/PoolTogether_) and [medium](https://medium.com/pooltogether) account. The repositories for their code is hosted on [Github](https://github.com/pooltogether). There is a [Discord ](https://pooltogether.com/discord) channel that is available to their community. The official documentation is hosted on [Gitbook](https://docs.pooltogether.com/).

      "content": "## TLDR;\n\n* This proposal seeks to whitelist the SILO token.\n* Requested Trading Liquidity of 200K BNT\n* This proposal will be run parallel to its sister proposal on SILO Governance and is contingent on Silo Governance committing 100K BNT Worth of SILO to the Pool Filling in Half the initial Liquidity.\n* The SILO Dao Agrees to not pull its liquidity for a year's time as a show of good faith.\n* There is no Reason to doubt the legitimacy of the project/team. Previous Concerns are addressed below.\n* Liquidity should be activated after April 21st since this will mark the beginning of CVX/CRV emissions and will act as a catalyst event for price. This is being done in order to avoid IL costs to the BancorDAO.\n* Silo is a lending platform focusing on single asset pools that interconnect via a bridge asset, removing the security issues seen in shared market lending.\n\nContract Address: 0x6f80310ca7f2c654691d1383149fa1a57d8ab1f8\n\nProject Website:[ https://www.silo.finance/](https://www.silo.finance/)\n\n## Project\n\nSilo is an isolated-markets lending protocol where all pools are plugged together through what is called the “Bridge” asset. Much like Uniswap pools, all lending pairs are paired with ETH and the ecosystem's native stable-coin USDs (Working Name). Silos can achieve cross collateral loans in the same way a DEX router does by going for example from WBTC -> ETH to ETH -> LINK. This novel design allows each market's risk to be isolated while also preventing fragmentation of liquidity.\n\n## Tokenomics/Security\n\nSILO does not have an elastic supply, or rebase mechanism. The SILO token has a current total supply of 103,250,000.00 SILO. Contracts are standard ERC-20 OpenZeppelin contracts. The contracts don’t have admin privileges that grant unrestricted burning of tokens.\n\nThe top 15 contracts and addresses with the highest concentration of SILO are Token Distribution contracts, wallets with 3.1122%, 0.6133%, 0.4667% of supply.\n\n![image](ipfs://QmWuHVjE6k2UBnbHZwWhpYdYyhj8fUdrZJ2c9arhP4TWw9)\n\nFigure 1 - Top 15 contract and address with the highest concentration of SILO\n\nOver the next 4 years, 1B [$SILO](https://etherscan.io/address/0x6f80310ca7f2c654691d1383149fa1a57d8ab1f8) tokens will be minted without the possibility of future inflation.

In addition it is important we seed this pool with a reasonable amount of liquidity given its concentrated curve pools are at 2 Million USD currently and with the CVX incentives going live on the 21st we should see that raise tremendously. Here are some projections for Curve Liquidity after incentives are applied:\n\n![image](ipfs://QmNWJhBZyDAwAvsD3THCrnqrQZVhyFrD7kYurcj5X2p2QG)\n\nBesides the Curve Pools we also see a substantial amount of liquidity currently in UNI V3 and the volume numbers are also incredibly lucrative:\n\n![image](ipfs://QmeYVq5VRPFZEPfxJZ33BE68emtotzscF9NSdPVxDrak5e)\n\n## Price & Stats\n\n|Silo Finance Price|$0.765466|\n|---|---|\n|Market Cap|$79,104,540|\n|Market Cap Dominance|0.00%|\n|Trading Volume|$3,289,743|\n|Volume / Market Cap|0.0416|\n\n## Community and Communication\n\nTwitter:[ https://twitter.com/SiloFinance](https://twitter.com/SiloFinance)\n\nTelegram:[ https://t.me/silo_community](https://t.me/silo_community)\n\nDiscord:[ https://discord.com/invite/silo-finance](https://discord.com/invite/silo-finance)\n\n## Audits\n\nSilo Finance is currently undergoing a variety of different audits by quality firms and individuals:\n\n* ABDK is Auditing the Protocol.\n* Quantstamp is Re-Auditing the Protocol.\n* Formal Code Reviews by known developers such as Mudit Gupta.\n\nThe Protocol is also launching an Immunify Campaign currently being finalized.\n\n## Previous Concerns\n\n[quote=\"mbr, post:96, topic:2308\"]\n\n> At the time of writing the Silo Finance [main Twitter account](https://twitter.com/SiloFinance?s=20&t=fd2OEYijjmp0JuvQ1Bss9A) has not yet acknowledged the proposal. More importantly, Silo Finance is heavily exposed to inflationary rewards programs such as those offered by the [Convex/Curve ecosystem ](https://twitter.com/SiloFinance/status/1500846825187774466?s=20&t=fd2OEYijjmp0JuvQ1Bss9A). It is poor timing for a whitelisting proposal for $SILO. The project itself is not dependent on these kinds of inflationary rewards; Silo Finance creates isolated money markets. The following activity is what is concerning:\n\n> \" *On Friday [$CVX](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24CVX&src=cashtag_click) price declined, offering a good entry. Knowing that buying with treasury would take 10 days, we decided to buy with dev fund and ask the DAO to reimburse it.* \"\n\n[/quote]\n\nI believe there was a breakdown in communication here, From reading that one might think the treasury was selling SILO to CVX but this is not the case. The CVX acquired by the treasury was purchased with USDC from the original raise and furthermore the purchase did not come out of left field. This had been discussed with the community extensively through discord (the idea was brought up by community members) and since the convex/silo ecosystem have great overlap there wasn’t any contention to this buy. As I see it there is no reason against listing, especially due to the Project’s high commitment to conservative emissions.\n\nTo further address these concerns we also propose that the Whitelisting is applied after the activation of CVX/CRV rewards. This will likely be a catalyst event for price and we would like the Pool to be activated after some price discovery has occurred to avoid IL costs to the BancorDAO.\n\n## Voting\n\n- FOR\n- AGAINST\n- ABSTAIN",

      "title": "Whitelist Lyra with 100K BNT Trading liquidity Limit",
      "content": "# TL;DR\n\n* Proposal to whitelist LYRA\n* Proposed trading liquidity limit is 100,000 BNT.\n* There are no apparent security concerns that would prohibit whitelist status.\n* There is no reason to doubt the legitimacy of the Lyra Finance project.\n* The benefit to Bancor is clear. Further integrations once LYRA is whitelisted can be pursued as well.\n\nLYRA token address: 0x01BA67AAC7f75f647D94220Cc98FB30FCc5105Bf\n\nProject Website: https://www.lyra.finance/\n\n# DAO Controlled Liquidity\n\nThe Lyra DAO intends to immediately fill the trading limit if it is approved. This would ensure that the capital in the pool is backed by the DAO and therefore would remain staked regardless of market conditions. This gives LYRA holders the confidence that they can always efficiently buy and sell their LYRA on Bancor at any time on Mainnet.\n\n# Token Security\n\nLYRA does not have an elastic supply, or rebase mechanism. The LYRA contracts do not have permissions that grant administrators unrestricted mint/burn capabilities. The LYRA token supply is fixed at 1,000,000,000, of which 102,049,103 are in [current circulation](https://api.lyra.finance/supply). The contracts and addresses with the highest concentration of LYRA tokens are predominantly the token vesting contracts, and DAO multi-sig. The team wallets and vesting contracts are discussed [here](https://leaps.lyra.finance/leaps/leap-7/).\n\n![image](ipfs://QmUeXGQogG68paATx4dxwnEg9XULezteeMxLYsvwaymQuZ)\n\n# Token Liquidity\n\nThe deepest LYRA pools are:\n\nThe LYRA/WETH 1% Uniswap V3 Pool on Optimism with $6.9mil liquidity and $36.87k Daily volume [[1](https://info.uniswap.org/#/optimism/tokens/0x50c5725949a6f0c72e6c4a641f24049a917db0cb)]\n\nThe LYRA/WETH Sushi Pool with $781.86k liquidity and $10,927 Daily volume [[2](https://app.sushi.com/analytics/1/pairs/0x52dac05fc0000e9f01ce9a1e91592bfbfce87350)]\n\nA trading liquidity limit of 100,000 BNT opens up space for at least 508,000k total liquidity, with BNT at $2.54. If the pool is filled, a proposal to increase the trading liquidity limit can be proposed\n\n# Project\n\nLyra is an on-chain Options AMM that provides 2-sided option markets on multiple Synthetix assets. Lyra is a high-performance, peer to peer options trading platform.\n\n# Tokenomics\n\nLyra’s native token, LYRA (ERC20), is a [utility](https://docs.lyra.finance/tokenomics/lyra) token. Token holders stake LYRA, to obtain xLYRA for the purpose of governance rights, inflationary rewards, boosts to liquidity provision rewards (for option market pools) of up to 2x, and trading rewards. Lyra has fully committed to decentralization with their [community rewards program](https://blog.lyra.finance/lyra-community-rewards/).\n\n# Community and Communication\n\nLyra is active on [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/P49mj6UbmC). The Lyra team also operates official [Twitter](https://twitter.com/lyrafinance) and [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtOGgWyfWRbWQibQ9BYvvIQ) accounts. Activity on [GitHub](https://github.com/lyra-finance) is frequent. The [development team](https://www.linkedin.com/company/lyrafinance/people/) and advisors are presented on the team’s Linkedin page. Michael Spain, Nick Forster, Domonik Romanowski and Jake Fitzgerald, the co-founders of Lyra are the project's main spokespeople.\n\n# Available Audits\n\nLyra has been audited three times since 2021, by reputable auditors:\n\n* [Certik](https://www.certik.com/projects/lyrafinance) (22 August, 2021)\n* [Cetora](https://certora.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/CVR/pages/60359364/Formal+Verification+Report+of+Lyra) (2 June, 2021)\n* [Iosiro](https://github.com/lyra-finance/lyra-protocol/blob/master/audits/v1/iosiro_report-lyra.pdf) (7 June, 2021)\n* Lyra also maintains an[ open bug bounty program](https://immunefi.com/bounty/lyra/).\n\n# Market and Trading Data\n\n* LYRA’s price at the time of writing is $0.215546\n* All-time high: $0.6898 (Dec 18, 2021 )\n* All-time low: $0.148 (Mar 07, 2022 )\n* Price 90 days ago: $.42\n* 102,049,103 [tokens in circulation](https://api.lyra.finance/supply)\n* 1,000,000,000 maximum supply.\n* LYRA is currently listed on centralized exchange BKEX\n* The current market capitalization is $21,497,715\n* The most recent 24-hour spot volumes range from $186.353 to $272,649\n\nBenefits for Bancor:\n\nWhite listing LYRA can benefit Bancor by bringing new traders, marketing the existence of the pool. The Bancor pool will be protocol owned liquidity and the only L1 access to the LYRA token.",

If full, the Bancor FODL pool would only have 31.50% of the liquidity in the FODL/USDC Sushiswap pool. Therefore, if it happens, a proposal to increase the trading liquidity limit again should be considered.\n\n### Volume and fee performance\n\nFODL pool weekly Volume and Fees are presented in Figures 2 and 3, respectively.\n\n![image](ipfs://QmeVdjbkHSXJawA2NDSoRkky8MkrABYWD1L78FeMGhpbvm)\n\nFigure 2 - FODL weekly volume since the end of February.\n\n\n![image](ipfs://QmYRF2FVwaSsCCVsYdkK9o5qcxinhxF5s2MybYcgZJyp9e)\n\nFigure 3 - FODL weekly fees since the end of February.\n\nThe pool would benefit from a larger trading liquidity limit to reduce swap price impact, increase volume/fees and thus improve APY.\n\nFOR\n\nIncrease trading liquidity in the FODL pool from 250k BNT to 500k BNT.\n\nAGAINST\n\nKeep the trading liquidity in the FODL pool at 250k BNT.\n\nAnalytics links available at original Governance proposal: https://gov.bancor.network/t/proposal-to-increase-the-trading-liquidity-limit-in-the-fodl-pool-from-250k-bnt-to-500k-bnt/3544",

      "title": "BIP18: Proposed Bancor 3 Liquidity Mining Program",
      "content": "# Voting instructions\n\nTo support the proposed BNT liquidity mining budget, and the emissions rate, vote FOR\n\nTo oppose the proposed protocol upgrade, and the features detailed herein, vote AGAINST\n\n# Summary\n\n* This proposal establishes an emissions program for BNT, which can be used to incentivise protocol participation for both BNT and non-BNT token holders, intended to grow the TVL of the platform, and further decentralize its liquidity provider user base.\n* A budget of 40,000,000 BNT is proposed, with a BNT:TKN incentives quotient of 3:1, or 75% to BNT liquidity providers, and 25% to TKN liquidity providers. Therefore:\n  * A total of 30,000,000 BNT is proposed to be distributed towards BNT liquidity providers via the auto-compounding rewards system, as described in [BIP15](https://gov.bancor.network/t/bip15-proposing-bancor-3/3445).\n  * A total of 10,000,000 BNT is proposed to be distributed to TKN liquidity providers via the standard rewards system, also as described in [BIP15](https://gov.bancor.network/t/bip15-proposing-bancor-3/3445).\n* The BNT auto-compounding rewards are proposed to utilize an exponential decay profile, with a half-life of 2 years (63,072,000 seconds). Therefore, under the proposed emissions scheme, the rate of rewards emission decreases predictably, achieving a halving every two years; the remaining rewards budget will be less than 1 BNT for the first time after approximately 18,133 days (49.7 years).\n* The standard BNT rewards budget is proposed for the DAO to use at its discretion over the coming years. The 10,000,000 BNT budget includes:\n  * 134,400 BNT allocated for the open beta, as described in BIP 16.\n  * All BNT “dual-mining” (in-kind) incentives, up to a maximum 50,000 BNT per asset, previously approved by the BancorDAO [see the [proposal](https://gov.bancor.network/t/proposal-incentivize-users-to-migrate-to-v3-by-matching-token-side-lm-rewards-with-up-to-50-000-bnt-per-pool/3318), and its [addendum](https://gov.bancor.network/t/proposal-addendum-incentivize-users-to-migrate-to-v3-by-matching-token-side-lm-rewards-with-up-to-50-000-bnt-per-pool/3355)].\n  * All future rewards programs and incentives for non-BNT assets, including those not yet decided, or proposed.\n\n# Understanding the BNT Rewards Distribution\n\nThe BNT supply is at approximately 262.2 M tokens. Approximately 53% (139.7 M) belongs to the Bancor Protocol, 33% (85.3 M) belong to liquidity providers, and 14% (37.1 M) is spread across the secondary markets, user wallets and centralized exchanges. It is important to appreciate how these segments of the BNT supply interact with each other, and how liquidity mining (i.e. inflationary rewards distribution) can be managed without inflicting too much economic harm.\n\n\n![image](ipfs://QmRuk7sb3BLrNRdNVGJY6HkxhMHnZkewKEawZD21fHuhfs)\n\nThe liquidity mining programs of Bancor 3 are supported through a combination of auto-compunding, and standard rewards mechanisms. The former is the result of bnBNT pool token destruction by the protocol, resulting in an effective redistribution of the orange section of the chart above, directly to the blue section. Meaning, the auto-compounding rewards program functions by slowly relinquishing network-owned, staked BNT to the BNT liquidity providers (and de facto guardians of the protocol). Interestingly, this does not affect the BNT supply at all, until a user completes a withdrawal. Since a withdrawal from a BNT stake results in the minting of new BNT, and the return of bnBNT pool tokens to the protocol’s ownership, the result is a simultaneous increase in both the gray- and orange-colored slices of the chart, with a concomitant reduction in the blue slice (as a proportion of the total BNt supply). In essence - the staked nature of BNT results in a kind of self-correcting increase in liquidity as users withdraw from the protocol, which helps to temper volatility, and preserves the integrity of the protocol. However, this effect is finite; as the blue segment gains ground over the orange segment, the ability of the protocol to keep an even keel could be compromised.\n\nIt is impossible to know for certain where the line should be drawn, and a conservative view is warranted until new economic theory can be developed that is better suited to describing the rapid inflationary fiscal policies of DeFi projects, and their financial consequences. With that said, there is little cause for alarm. The Bancor Network Token is among the most liquid assets in its weight class, and the Bancor Protocol continues to control the lion’s share of the token supply, supporting natural price discovery and protection from market dysfunction, such as “rage quits” and other problematic behaviors.\n\nTo maintain the health of the token, and by extension the health of the system, the protocol- and user-owned BNT stakes ought to be comparable in size. Unfortunately it is impossible to know precisely how the BNT markets will develop over time. Price fluctuations, combined with changing BNT funding limits by the BancorDAO, can have a dramatic impact on the relative sizes of these segments. In lieu of a reliable predictor for these influences into the future, it is acceptable to model the token distribution in the present day and forecast future distributions based entirely on liquidity mining emissions. It is from this foundation that an approximate 30,000,000 BNT auto-compounding budget is proposed. At the conclusion of the program, and all else remaining equal, the protocol-owned, and user-owned segments are expected to be roughly equivalent.\n\n\n![image](ipfs://QmNuT6HkNrVJY1TmWehtrsYzhN5qfgH1JTm11b2V8EkWGP)\n\nThe effect of standard rewards emissions should also be addressed. Unlike the auto-compounding rewards, there is no intrinsic stake that helps to maintain liquidity of the protocol. It is helpful to imagine the standard rewards (i.e. those given to non-BNT stakers) as being injected directly into secondary markets. The consequences of this remain to be seen; however, the trend is towards a diminishing liquid proportion of the token supply overall. While there are some nuances to how the equilibrium is re-established over the course of the emissions schedule (e.g. through the accumulation of BNT trade revenue, the effect of the Bancor Vortex, and staking sentiment amongst the community), the destabilizing effect is a foregone conclusion, and one that is likely to be received without too much controversy (I hope).\n\nAs before, it is impossible to describe strict guidelines for how these emissions should be managed on the non-BNT staking side of the user demographic, especially without knowledge of future shifts in the market. Therefore, similar to the case above, we can allow ourselves the assumption that the standard rewards emissions are essentially destined for the secondary market segment of the chart (gray-colored). Under this premise, it stands to reason that the total non-liquid component of the BNT supply should be similar to that which has sustained the protocol over the course of 2020. With this in mind, an acceptable non-liquid proportion of the token supply is somewhere in the range of 13-17%; targeting the upper bound allows for a 10,000,000 BNT budget for all incentives not associated with the auto-compounding rewards program. Importantly, the incentives used for the Beta release ought to be treated as though they were taken from this budget, as should all future rewards for any purpose other than rewarding BNT liquidity providers.\n\n\n![image](ipfs://QmfARARSyzVxiWFdawN93PnXo4qqqXDQbA6VxRURuNWzx7)\n\n# Program Duration\n\nOne of the most significant advantages of the Bancor 3 release is its ability to support reasonable, sustained rewards programs without pandering to the apparently insatiable inflation appetite of DeFi mercenaries. Similar to Bitcoin, the auto-compounding rewards programs on Bancor 3 can be made to follow an exponential decay curve, allowing for long-term distributions free from sudden shocks to both the token supply, and equally importantly, sudden cessation of rewards programs.\n\nHere, it is proposed that the 30,000,000 BNT auto-compounding programutilize a 2-year half-life, creating a distribution schedule with the following profile:\n\n\n![image](ipfs://QmcbC37AwbX3u1sKPQL3jw3AcSF5cgyChymL9tAkZQTYqJ)\n\nTo estimate the expected APR from liquidity mining emissions exclusively for BNT stakers, the following expression has been developed:\n\n\n![image](ipfs://QmeyfyUsnMzFRkqQ3EiJtKx1uaz4bdCCEcMX5dvP4VdxzE)\n\nwhere a is the total emissions to be received by BNT stakers, b is the Unix Timestamp at the commencement of the staking rewards program, c is the decay constant, d is the total user-staked BNT on Bancor v2.1, e is Euler’s constant (2.71828…), f is the number of seconds in one day (86400), and g is the number of days in one year (365). If this proposal is successful, the total emissions (a) can be assumed to be 30,000,000 BNT. The commencement timestamp (b) is arbitrary; it can be set to any number, including zero. The decay constant (c) can be determined from the target half-life (t1/2), which is assumed to be two years (63,113,904 seconds), as follows:\n\n\n![image](ipfs://QmWLtQuLZjeYzRgVScKtbBjWrL4QPmK98Fx4m2S1qFbrCC)\n\nThe user-staked BNT can be calculated from the Bancor Dune Analytics page, and is assumed here to be 85,000,000 BNT. Therefore, the values a-g are constants.\n\nThe variable x represents the total days elapsed of the rewards program, and y represents the proportion of user-staked BNT in v3, compared to v2.1. These two values should be considered the inputs to a function that returns the apparent APR for the same day as x. This arrangement allows for the effect of different growth velocities of Bancor3 (with respect to BNT staking) to be examined with respect to the apparent APR (z, %):\n\n\n![image](ipfs://Qme84YnL2GdpbFUGTgV3th6eW3cqdtEHn2BZzkJFfK5e4m)",

Liquidity Mining TKN rewards to TKN pools and BNT rewards to the BNT pool will auto-compound. TKN rewards to the BNT pool and BNT rewards to TKN pools can be claimed or restaked via a standard rewards contract which will accept bnBNT and bnTKN pool tokens as proof of deposit.\n\nThe BNT Liquidity Mining Rewards budget of 40,000,000 BNT and emission to BNT Liquidity Providers is detailed in [BIP18](https://gov.bancor.network/t/bip18-proposed-bancor-3-liquidity-mining-program/3500). There is an active Dual LM program whereby any TKN committed for Liquidity Mining rewards will be matched up to 50,000 BNT in the TKN pool and emitted over 24 months. A considerable number of projects and DAOs have expressed interest in the program.\n\nTo ensure that the BancorDAO is aligned with any proposal that involves using the BNT LM budget, this proposal seeks to split the “Liquidity Mining” category into two - a category for “BNT Liquidity Mining on the BNT pool’: and a category for “BNT Liquidity Mining on TKN pools”. A proposal in the former category will maintain a requirement of 35% quorum and 66.7% supermajority to pass, and a proposal in the latter must meet a requirement of 35% quorum and 80% supermajority to pass.\n\n\nThe current Quorum and Supermajority requirements are:\n\n|type|quorum|supermajority|\n|---|---|---|\n|whitelisting proposals|35%|66.70%|\n|trading liquidity limit < 1M BNT|35%|66.70%|\n|trading liquidity limit > 1M BNT|40%|66.70%|\n|liquidity mining|35%|66.70%|\n|pool fees|20%|66.70%|\n|governance and protocol|35%|66.70%|\n\n**The proposed Quorum and Supermajority requirements are:**\n|type|quorum|supermajority|\n|---|---|---|\n|whitelisting proposals|35%|66.70%|\n|trading liquidity limit < 1M BNT|35%|66.70%|\n|trading liquidity limit > 1M BNT|40%|66.70%|\n|BNT emissions for TKN|35%|80%|\n|BNT emissions for BNT|35%|66.70%|\n|pool fees|20%|66.70%|\n|governance and protocol|35%|66.70%|",

      "title": "BIP21: DAO Multisig Intervention Policy",
      "content": "# Voting instructions\n\nVote FOR to grant the DAO mult-sig signers the authority to disable swaps and liquidity provision for compromised tokens on the Bancor Network, with retroactive community approval.\n\nVote AGAINST to prohibit DAO mult-sig signers from intervening with pool functions prior to a DAO vote.\n\n# Summary\n\n1. The prerequisites for whitelisting a token on Bancor are in place to prevent attempted exploits of the Bancor protection mechanism.\n2. However, hacks and exploits, and coordinated exits (“rug-pulls”) affecting a token that has passed the vetting process can still become a threat to the system.\n3. This proposal provides a detailed policy whereby the BancorDAO can intervene in the operation of affected pools, immediately after a token has become compromised.\n4. The scope of the interventions available to the DAO authority are:\n\n  1. Adding liquidity is disabled on the affected pool.\n  2. Swaps are disabled on the affected pool.\n\n5. The DAO isn’t allowed to intervene with the withdrawal of funds, save for the adjustments to the protection mechanism.\n6. The actions of the operations multi-sig signers must then be ratified with a DAO vote. The signers must provide a short report that describes the motivation behind any actions taken, and publish it to [Discourse](http://gov.bancor.network) in a timely manner. The DAO will then vote to uphold or reverse the decision via the normal process.\n7. This format allows for action to be taken to protect the protocol in time-sensitive situations. The requirement for retroactive community approval preserves the integrity and authority of the BancorDAO.\n\n\n![image](ipfs://QmbwrWJMqJo93cTdWMqsL5hhct9DjTwoTi3tJ7Z9VLoExm)\n\n## Some Threats Cannot be Anticipated on Long Time Horizons\n\nThe [prerequisites for whitelisting a token](https://gov.bancor.network/t/whitelisting-requirements/1849) on Bancor provide a helpful filter against predictable security risks. A reasonable scope of common abuse vectors are covered that provide a high level of protection from deliberate exploit attempts, hacks, and other nefarious behavior that could allow an antagonist to siphon value from the network. However, an element of risk will always persist, where events elsewhere in the Defi ecosystem can affect the health of a pool, regardless of the community’s diligence during whitelisting.\n\nThere are an infinite number of possible scenarios where a fully-audited, vetted and community-approved token for a respectable and trustworthy project can turn malignant. For example, a large reservoir of the token could be drained from another protocol, AMM or otherwise, which could then be used to perform a very large trade on Bancor. In such a scenario, neither the token’s ERC20 contract nor the team that created it are at fault, and anticipating these types of attack vectors for all tokens on our network is simply untenable.\n\n## DAO Bureaucracy is Effective, but Slow\n\nThe BancorDAO has demonstrated an exceptional ability to govern. Processes have been created that ensure a high level of engagement and community awareness, albeit at a significant time cost. The time interval between the appearance of a well-considered and polished proposal on Discourse, and executing the relevant actions following a successful DAO vote is simply too long to be a tenable route to intercepting an apparent threat, after it is discovered. Moreover, the fact that such a proposal exists serves to advertise the exploit opportunity, heightening the risk that an antagonist might act on it. In short, the existing channels for the DAO to exercise its powers are rendered impotent in the face of an oncoming and imminent attack, or an exploit in an external contract that can damage the protocol unintentionally.\n\n## Retroactive, Time-Sensitive Decisions\n\nSome threats can be anticipated, and presents a short window of time wherein the DAO multi-sig signers can act, thus eliminating or reducing damage to the Bancor Network. With the acceptance of this proposal, the DAO is agreeing to allow the mult-sig signers to act appropriately when a perceived, avoidable risk becomes known. The actions that the mult-sig authority may take prior to a formal DAO vote are strictly limited. To prevent theft, or another problem arising from a known issue affecting certain tokens, the DAO will allow the mult-sig authority to temporarily cease swaps and liquidity provision to affected pools, as required. These actions need not be executed together; depending on the nature of the perceived threat, it may only be necessary to exercise only one of these options rather than all of them. Importantly, user withdrawals must not be inhibited.\n\n## Ratification of Actions Taken\n\nAfter the multi-sig signers have interrupted the functioning of a pool, a written report must be made available that clearly describes the rationale for the actions taken, and provide sufficient evidence for DAO members to consider whether the action was warranted. This is unlikely to be controversial. Thereafter, the report will be incorporated into a formal DAO proposal, and the actions of the mult-sig signers will be ratified via the voting process. This is especially important if the measures taken to protect the protocol are expected to persist indefinitely.\n\n## False Alarms and Reactivation\n\nIf due to a misunderstanding, or misinterpretation of the perceived threat, or it being nullified in a timely manner, the msig signers may reverse the actions taken to restore proper functioning of the pool, prior to a DAO vote. Under these circumstances, a written report must be made available, regardless of the decision reversal. The report should detail precisely why action was taken, and reasoning for its reversal. In these cases, the report should be published to the governance Discourse pages, under the Community Chatroom category (as the report is not a draft proposal, and will not result in a vote).",

In essence, the “beta” variable will be changed from ‘True’ to ‘False’. That’s it.\n  * At the termination of the beta period, all whitelisted assets will be accessible with unlimited capacity for deposits, and the front end will be activated for the first time, including migration support.\n  * Therefore, the vote to end the Beta will mark the official launch of Bancor 3.\n  * If the DAO does not vote to end it prematurely, the beta will conclude at the end of 28 days.\n\nThe Bancor Foundation has agreed to support a bug bounty of up to $1,000,000, and will run concurrently with the beta release.\n\nHigh-Level Program Details\n\n* The three tokens proposed for the Beta release are ETH, DAI and LINK.\n* The capacity for token deposits during the Beta release is limited; the unlimited staking feature of the Bancor 3 full release is inactive until the completion of the Beta program.\n* The target total BNT contribution to the network over the full duration of the Beta program is $30,000,000 (13,043,478 BNT based on a token price of $2.30 at the time of writing).\n  * Approximately $10,000,000 in BNT funding per asset, supporting $10,000,000 in TKN trading liquidity (i.e. a total of $20,000,000 per pool)\n  * To allow the protocol to exercise its new withdrawal algorithm, and observe the full spectrum of contract and user behavior, the total capacity of the system will be set to exceed the total tradable liquidity by approximately 10%.\n  * Therefore, the Beta target TVL should approach $63,000,000 ($30,000,000 BNT liquidity, $33,000,000 TKN liquidity) over the course of the program.\n* Gradual increments in deposit limits will be held for 4 days, then doubled in the next cycle:.\n\n* The network will experience 6 increments (7 total cycles) in total TVL adjustments, as follows:\n  * Cycle 1 begins with a maximum deposit limit of approximately $515,625 equivalent value of TKN, and $468,750 of BNT funding.\n    * Cycle 1 is held for a period of 4 days (total program = 4 days).\n  * Cycle 2 doubles the previous USD equivalents of the previous cycle, with $1,031,250 equivalent value of TKN, and $937,500 of BNT funding.\n    * Cycle 2 is held for a period of 4 days (total program = 8 days).\n  * Cycle 3 doubles the previous USD equivalents of the previous cycle, with $2,062,500 equivalent value of TKN, and $1,875,000 of BNT funding.\n    * Cycle 3 is held for a period of 4 days (total program = 12 days).\n  * Cycle 4 doubles the previous USD equivalents of the previous cycle, with $4,125,000 equivalent value of TKN, and $3,750,000 of BNT funding.\n    * Cycle 4 is held for a period of 4 days (total program = 16 days).\n  * Cycle 5 doubles the previous USD equivalents of the previous cycle, with $8,250,000 equivalent value of TKN, and $7,500,000 of BNT funding.\n    * Cycle 5 is held for a period of 4 days (total program = 20 days).\n  * Cycle 6 doubles the previous USD equivalents of the previous cycle, with $16,500,000 equivalent value of TKN, and $15,000,000 of BNT funding.\n    * Cycle 6 is held for a period of 4 days (total program = 24 days).\n  * Cycle 7 doubles the previous USD equivalents of the previous cycle, with $33,000,000 equivalent value of TKN, and $30,000,000 of BNT funding.\n    * Cycle 7 is held for a period of 4 days (total program = 28 days).\n* The total TVL is proposed to be managed during this time, such that each asset has approximately equal liquidity, as judged by its USD valuation, over the course of the beta release.\n  * The adjustments made during the course of the program should be such that the USD valuation targets of the liquidity of the network are prioritized; the proposed doubling schedule is with reference to the previous target USD valuation, rather than the prior token balance of the network.\n  * Therefore, volatile changes in either the TKN or BNT price are a secondary consideration to the proposed growth schedule, and the valuation of the TVL at any time will of course fluctuate with changes in the market conditions.\n\n![image](ipfs://QmZWxNa9bY5Zwoc988P7MCKHkwWsfr1J9xaS2mVaThkDS1)\n\n![image](ipfs://QmU9qRD44TiBHSK7kYPCCVxp7Fcim4Gr4fX1m9mqeykhkE)\n\nCessation of the Beta and Full-Launch of Bancor 3\n\nAt any point during the proposed 28-day program, the BancorDAO may vote to end the Beta restrictions, and begin the launch of the Bancor 3 full version.\n\n* All TVL limits are rescinded, and unlimited staking becomes active.\n* The DAO-approved token whitelist is effective immediately with unlimited staking, and BNT funding limits as detailed in [BIP17].\n* The updated front end becomes live, including the one-click migration option from v2.1 to Bancor 3. Additional front end features will be added over time.\n\nUnless the DAO votes to terminate the beta test period early, it will be concluded at the end of 28 days. More importantly, if a critical issue is discovered as a result of the bug bounty, or within the concurrent second audit, the beta release can be paused until the problem is addressed.\n\n# A Note on Implementation and TVL Targets\n\nThe behavior of the new contracts provides a potential problem with respect to imposing an arbitrary TKN capacity limit while observing a target trading liquidity. The reason is that our bootstrapping process deliberately limits the growth rate of a pool’s trading liquidity to within a power of 2, regardless of how much TKN liquidity is actually provided.\n\nFor example, suppose that the Beta launch begins and a zealous LINK provider exhausts the entire liquidity capacity at the first possible opportunity. When they do so, the pool will accept up to this limit, but not more than that (a limitation of the Beta only, not the main release). Then, the bootstrapping process begins:\n\n* A check is made to ensure that there is more than sufficient LINK to satisfy the 10,000 BNT bootstrapping requirement (see [BIP15](https://gov.bancor.network/t/bip15-proposing-bancor-3/3445)).\n* An initial rate is set, and trading is activated with 10,000 BNT and the appropriate amount of LINK..\n* This is the starting condition for all pools on Bancor 3; as new liquidity providers add liquidity, the trading liquidity is allowed to double until the BNT funding limit is reached.\n\nThe problem is that the enthusiastic first LINK user will have exhausted the TKN capacity of the Beta release in a single transaction. Therefore, no further LINK tokens can be accepted until the next cycle, 4 days later. Even then, the increase will be restricted to a maximum of 20,000 BNT in funding, rather than the USD target.\n\nTo adjust for this behavior, TKN capacity limits can be adjusted by as little as a single TKN, allowing for the doubling behavior of the available trading liquidity to take place as intended. Therefore, the USD valuations of the pools are a moving target, and single-contributions that overwhelm the fixed-growth settings of the system can be alleviated by adjusting the capacity limit by a single TKN unit as required, such that the self-limiting growth of the available trading liquidity can be observed.\n\n# Beta Release Rewards Schedule\n\nThe Beta release is proposed to be accompanied by its own rewards schedule, to assist with participation and TVL targets. This section discusses the precise schedule of limit increases, and the incentives program to encourage users to participate in the live Beta. The Beta rewards program also serves to trial the BNT rewards via bnTKN staking, in contrast to the auto-compounding mechanism. Importantly, to reach the target liquidity of the soft launch, the incentives should be competitive with those still running on v2.1.\n\nAn emissions schedule consisting of a total of 178,000 BNT (approx. $410,933 at the time of writing) distributed at a rate of 2,133 tokens per day, per staked asset (including BNT) is proposed. These rewards are proposed to be taken from the fixed rewards budget as detailed in BIP 17. Since this is a flat emissions rate for a short period of time, the apparent APR will be very high in the beginning, and will taper off logarithmically as the TKN capacity limits are lifted. In the first cycle, the projected APR will be approximately 1,000%, and will progressively halve until the end of cycle 7. It should be stressed that these numbers are impossible to predict with certainty - they are contingent on the USD valuation of the paired tokens, as well as BNT itself.\n\n|Cycle No.|Time period (days)|Apparent APR (%)|\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|1|1-4|1,042%|\n|2|4-8|521%|\n|3|8-12|260%|\n|4|12-16|130%|\n|5|16-20|65%|\n|6|20-24|33%|\n|7|24-28|16%|\n\n\n![image](ipfs://QmWTYaMHPVFUPqYvQhCSSyfA9MUUo6LAFNBZzDzE4dC5go)\n",

      "content": "# Voting instructions\n\nTo support the proposed protocol upgrade, and the features detailed herein, vote FOR\n\nTo oppose the proposed protocol upgrade, and the features detailed herein, vote AGAINST\n\n# Bancor 3 Product Specifications\n\nThe following document is organized into three sections:\n\n1. Summary of Features. This section summarizes the major features of the new release, with a focus on what the features are, with little or no explanation of how they work.\n2. Abridged Description of Bancor 3. This section is a condensed version of the remaining document sections. Minimal detail is provided, intended to serve the purpose of a fast-reference guide, rather than an instructional purpose.\n3. Comprehensive Description of Bancor 3. This section contains an in-depth explanation for all aspects of the Bancor 3 system at a high-level. In combination with the soon-to-be-published smart contract code, these sections can be studied to attain a thorough working knowledge of the theory and behavior of the Bancor 3 system.\n\n# Concise Summary of Features\n\n## Impermanent (“Divergence ”) Loss Protection\n\nLiquidity provided on Bancor 3 is immediately protected from impermanent loss, including all fee revenue accrued thereon. To enable immediate protection, withdrawals are subject to an exit fee, and a cooldown period, both of which are adjustable by the BancorDAO. At launch, these values are 0.25%, and 7 days, respectively.\n\n## Single-Side Pool Tokens\n\nLiquidity stakes on Bancor 3 are represented by single-side pool tokens. These pool tokens represent the fully protected valuation of the user’s stake, including all value accrued on the position since the stake was established. These pool tokens are fungible, composable ERC20 tokens.\n\n## Omnipool\n\nUsers are no longer required to make a choice as to which specific pool they wish to contribute their BNT liquidity to, as it is deposited into a single network pool. All trades will be routed via the BNT omnipool. BNT stakes generate single-side pool tokens, in addition to vBNT – the governance token of the BancorDAO.\n\n## Infinity Pools\n\nBancor v3 supports unlimited liquidity provision for all assets in its network. There are two major components in every pool; the trading liquidity, which is used to support exchange, and the superfluid component, which can be used for essentially any purpose. The superfluid component will be of paramount importance in upcoming phases of the Bancor 3 phased rollout. The fate of the provided liquidity is determined by the network settings, which are established via the governance process.\n\n## Bootstrapping\n\nFollowing a successful whitelisting proposal, the network will immediately begin accepting TKN stakes to its superfluid component. Trading pools are initialized and bootstrapped by the DAO msig signers, after sufficient liquidity has accumulated. At this time, the superfluid component is partitioned, such that the minimum amount of TKN liquidity is available for trading. Thereafter, the pool depth is allowed to double in size with each new staking action, independent of the size of the stake.\n\n## Automatic Shutdown\n\nThe logic contained within the functions of Bancor 3 assumes the price quoted by each of its pools is reliable. As pools become illiquid, this assumption is no longer valid. Therefore, to prevent abuse, pools with fewer than 1,000 BNT (adjustable by the DAO) tokens in their reserve following a liquidity add/remove event are automatically dismantled. During a shutdown, all TKN trading liquidity is returned to the superfluid component, and all BNT trading liquidity is removed and burned by the protocol.\n\n## Governance\n\nBancor 3 is under the exclusive control of BancorDAO. The existing governance policies and processes are inherited by the new release, and vBNT continues to serve as the voting token. All contracts, including vaults, are upgradeable, and governed by the DAO alone.\n\n## Rewards Programs\n\nStaking incentives are supported by Bancor 3 in two formats; auto-compounding, and standard. Unique to Bancor 3, the auto-compounding rewards are a “gasless” solution that does not require the user to take any additional actions, and is a true single-sided distribution that is without recourse to an intermediate swap step. The auto-compounding mechanism requires the type of reward token and staked token to be the same; in situations where the reward and stake have different identities, the standard rewards format can be used instead. The standard rewards contract is derived from the industry standard established by Synthetix and requires users to manually claim rewards in the familiar way. These rewards programs are open to all projects that wish to use them, for example, to incentivize liquidity for their own assets.\n\n## Advanced Withdrawal Logic\n\nBancor 3 utilizes an improved set of operations to increase the likelihood that users withdrawing from the protocol will receive the full value of their stake including impermanent loss compensation entirely in TKN; the new algorithm attempts to avoid reimbursing TKN liquidity providers in BNT. The logic is symmetrical, and also allows the protocol to better manage its liabilities, resulting in a more financially efficient method of providing impermanent loss insurance.\n\n## External Impermanent Loss Protection\n\nTo assist the BancorDAO with its risk management, and support whitelisting new tokens, external teams can commit to providing their own token as part of the impermanent loss coverage for their users. The external coverage dampens the potential risks to the protocol, and therefore makes whitelisting potentially volatile tokens more attractive for the DAO. Moreover, the external coverage provides greater assurance to TKN stakers that the value of their withdrawal will be realized exclusively in the TKN they provided.\n\n## Bancor Vortex\n\nThe function of the Bancor Vortex remains unchanged in the new release; however, its specific behavior is modified to be more efficient. Rather than collecting a wide variety of token types, the Vortex on Bancor 3 will collect BNT exclusively; fees earned in TKN are swapped immediately for BNT. Therefore, triggering the Vortex results in a single swap of BNT for vBNT directly, rather than a myriad of swaps across numerous TKN pools for BNT as a first step. This simplified arrangement has consequences both for the effective value burned, and an improved gas efficiency overall.\n\n## Migration\n\nThe transition from v2.1 to Bancor 3 is specifically supported, and can be performed via a “one click” process. Users with many unique stakes on a single pool will benefit from batch transfers of these positions. Gas costs are dependent on the number of unique pools a user has staked to. With the full deployment of Bancor 3 contracts, the rewards programs on v2.1 will be stopped; it no longer makes sense to incentivise liquidity there after Bancor 3 is available. An alternative rewards program will be created on Bancor 3, and serves to further incentivise users to migrate.",

      "content": "### TL;DR\n\n* This proposal seeks to increase the trading liquidity limit from 1M BNT to 2M BNT.\n\n* The ICHI liquidity on other liquidity sources justifies the increase.\n\n* ICHI to Deposit 30k ICHI ($1,344,000 at time of writing) from the ICHI Treasury into the Bancor protocol pending ICHI Governance approval\n\n* Pool volume and fees accrued are presented.\n\n* Increasing the pool’s liquidity will improve price impact and help direct more volume to Bancor.\n\n### Background & Rationale\n\n* [ICHI was whitelisted on April 26th, 2021 1](https://vote.bancor.network/#/bancornetwork.eth/proposal/Qmc1xBSwD4h2wLEQ5RhKSBUNmXQehirYfA9Vvk4xR6kaNA) with an overwhelming response of 51% quorum and 97.41% for votes.\n* I[CHI trading liquidity limit was increased to 350k BNT ](https://snapshot.org/#/bancornetwork.eth/proposal/Qma497eAYu2j5QaaXkHZQFgXsMZjUQ5pEvcSE9rGv1o2WD)on June 10, 2021 with 54% quorum and 99.85% for votes.\n* [ICHI trading liquidity limit was increased to 700k BNT ](https://snapshot.org/#/bancornetwork.eth/proposal/QmV6M52KVoV7VmGEN895yzo2dzc9fHkPVcZKfDkRdZjKSD)on August 18, 2021 with 41.48% quorum and 91.2% for votes.\n* [ICHI trading liquidity limit was increased to 1M BNT](https://snapshot.org/#/bancornetwork.eth/proposal/0xc921fe2d786897d2765e9901e39745bf593e3fbbfcf4c4314be828977c99b440) on February 2, 2022 with 49.08% quorum and 100% for votes.\n\nSince the most recent trading liquidity limit increase, ICHI released a new product to its suite of Uniswap v3 liquidity management - HODL Vaults!\n\nSince their release, ICHI has already launched its first HODL Vaults, locking in over $10M in TVL in the two weeks. HODL Vault partners include Gnosis, Nexus Mutual, and Celsius.\n\n### Trading Liquidity Limit Increase Justification:\n\nWith the recent release of ICHI’s HODL Vaults and its 4x price increase, Bancor has been able to continue to grow its TVL through the market downturn. [ICHI currently provides a 22.4% APY to this pool via xICHI rewards](https://app.ichi.org/farm). With only 19,697 of ICHI able to be deposited, an increase in trading liquidity limit to 2M BNT will enable:\n\n1. ICHI to deposit 30k ICHI to the Bancor protocol.\n2. Additional ICHI holders to deposit ICHI to Bancor protocol.\n3. Bancor to strengthen the partnership with ICHI and continue to grow TVL.\n\n### Liquidity\n\nThe ICHI pools with deepest liquidity in Ethereum DEXes are:\n\nThe oneUNI / ICHI 1% Uniswap v3 pool with $27.10m liquidity [1].\n\nThe ICHI 0.3% Bancor v2.1 pool with $12,159,707 liquidity [2].\n\nThe ICHI / wNXM 0.3% Uniswap v3 pool with $5.70m liquidity [3].\n\nThe ICHI / GNO 0.3% Uniswap v3 pool with $5.32m liquidity [4].\n\nThe ICHI / WETH 0.3% Sushiswap pool with $4,429,479.02 liquidity [5].\n\nThe ICHI / ETH 0.3% Uniswap v3 pool with $1.06m liquidity [6].\n\nThe ICHI / USDC 1% Uniswap v3 pool with $857.39k liquidity [7].\n\nThe extra liquidity would bring the total pool liquidity to at least ~$13.5m if the space in the pool is filled.\n\n![image](ipfs://Qmc8N3Qn9v842Q7ATv37HU6RdPCE9Z7hbQGMuEfJ84Mj1R)\nFigure 1 - ICHI Weekly Volume since the beginning of August 2021.\n\n![image](ipfs://Qme2e2h6gvUXN7ZKJhc34f6kE3CwXKL4K9xSpgozFUsnqF)\nFigure 2 - ICHI Weekly Fees since the beginning of August 2021.\n\nFOR\n\nIncrease trading liquidity in the ICHI pool from 1M BNT to 2M BNT.\n\nAGAINST\n\nKeep the trading liquidity in the ICHI pool at 1M BNT.\n\n[1] https://info.uniswap.org/#/pools/0x6dedf50966dbef7c5dec3607debe118f28b6bf33\n\n[2] https://etherscan.io/address/0x4a2F0Ca5E03B2cF81AebD936328CF2085037b63B\n\n[3] https://info.uniswap.org/#/pools/0x0002e63328169d7feea121f1e32e4f620abf0352\n\n[4] https://info.uniswap.org/#/pools/0xa5a4adaf57988a96e40a1a96f588455669f025b4\n\n[5] https://analytics.sushi.com/pairs/0x9cd028b1287803250b1e226f0180eb725428d069\n\n[6] https://info.uniswap.org/#/pools/0x275ef1031161d9358a7a35d5028f9d03845d4f2d\n\n[7] https://info.uniswap.org/#/pools/0xf2c055823dd744234694815c6c42f2956191ce1f",

      "title": "Incentivize users to migrate to V3 by matching token side LM rewards with up to 50,000 BNT per pool. Available once per pool.",
      "content": "## TL;DR\nThis proposal is an addendum to the original proposal for the dual LM rewards program, and the addendum that extended the cut-off date from end of March 2022 to end of April 2022.\n\n* An estimate to Bancor 3’s release for “late April/early May” has been provided in the last community call. Therefore, an extension of the Dual LM program until the end of May is justified so that teams, projects, and DAOs can commit tokens for Dual Liquidity Mining once Bancor 3 is live.\n* In Bancor 3, external token projects can incentivise their own communities by providing liquidity incentives in their own TKN.\n* To garner fast adoption, bring awareness to the External Liquidity Mining rewards tool, and lubricate the transition from Bancor v2.1 to Bancor 3, this proposal seeks to match external team’s liquidity mining incentives in dollar value at the time of token commitment, up to a maximum of 50,000 BNT, emitted over a 24 months schedule.\n* The matched BNT will be emitted over a 24 months schedule. The 2-year duration is chosen with a long term view in mind.\n\n## External Liquidity Mining feature\n\nExternal Liquidity Mining will be a new feature available on Bancor 3’s Phase 0 release. Blog post about v3 at https://blog.bancor.network/introducing-bancor-3-962a3c601c25 and Mark’s presentation on V3: Bancor 3: Dawn Phase 1 Keynote @ DCentral Miami - YouTube.\n\nLiquidity Mining is a convenient tool to bootstrap liquidity with proven results. Figure 1 and 2 show the pool balance increasing significantly after LM rewards were activated, and finally stabilising at a higher TVL than before the program started. Figure 3 shows the Liquidity Share for the FARM pool increasing once LM rewards were activated, and stabilising at higher values.\n\n\n![image](ipfs://Qmb1HYt7ncghoAMbqW4pydtCrNo27Riut8pCtyMwxmXd5P)\nFigure 1 - WOO pool balance over time. LM rewards started at the end of May 2021.\n\n![image](ipfs://QmRvMMqbYP9XuqiNVX7nkD5rNNpeJ9zt3i8X7gHhwDoN9w)\nFigure 2 - FARM pool balance over time. LM rewards started at the end of July.\n\n![image](ipfs://QmP3v2d1wi1g4oFjiDJoPLv8MMmGpVMdgdpkn7PrSk5hUW)\n1600×383 121 KB\nFigure 3 - FARM Liquidity Share on Ethereum.\n\nMatching the rewards on TKN with BNT rewards means that less BNT is needed for Liquidity Mining compared to v2.1.\n\nSince the announcement of Bancor V3, there has been strong interest among white listed tokens to offer LM rewards. Migration to V3 can be achieved in a single click via the Bancor app. The liquidity incentives discussed here are an important component in stimulating users to migrate from v2.1 to Bancor3.\n\nTo accelerate the adoption, and help raise awareness for this feature, each white listed token that commits to their own auto-compounding rewards program, the BancorDAO will match the emissions value up to a maximum of 50,000 BNT.\n\nThere is no requirement that the token and BNT LM be on the same emission schedule; however, the BNT emissions will be non-negotiable and fixed over a 24-month period.\n\nTo receive the BNT rewards, LPs need to stake their LP tokens in a rewards contract. Decision on the rewards emission schedule is purposely open-ended and will be proposed and decided at a later stage by the BancorDAO.\n\nIn conclusion, the Dual LM rewards program seeks to:\n* Incentivise LPs to migrate from Bancor v2.1 to Bancor 3.\n* Increase awareness of the External Liquidity Mining feature.\n* Attract more LPs from different communities to stake on Bancor and get familiarised with Bancor3 features.\n* The BNT emission schedule has a long-term view in mind.\n\nFOR\n\nAccept the addendum to move the cut-off date from the end of April 2022 to the end of May 2022.\n\nAGAINST\n\nContinue with the previous dual LM rewards proposal with a cut-off date at the end of April 2022.",

      "content": "This proposal is expected to appear on Snapshot for voting on March 13th, 2022 (London) . Make sure to stake your vBNT for voting before this date and time to participate in the DAO decision.\n\n## TL;DR\nThis proposal seeks to increase the trading liquidity limit in the PHTR pool from 400,000 BNT to 800,000 BNT.\nPhuture Finance will stake 6.8m PHTR (roughly $860,000) that will be made available with the increase in the trading limit. \n\n## DAO controlled liquidity\nThe PhutureDAO intends to immediately fill the new trading limit if it is approved. This would ensure that the capital in the pool is backed by the DAO and therefore would remain staked regardless of market conditions. This gives PHTR holders confidence that they can always efficiently buy and sell their PHTR on Bancor at any time.\n\n## Rationale\nFrom PhutureDAO’s perspective this trading limit increase symbolises our continued commitment to using Bancor as not only our primary liquidity provider on Ethereum, but also our commitment to using Bancor as our treasury management solution. Bancor will allow us to maintain the same composition of treasury assets through single-sided staking, keep intact the buy and hold return profile of our PHTR with IL protection and allow us to be productive with the PHTR through fee generation.\n\nAdditionally, having a deeper liquidity pool will allow us to utilise our DAO assets more efficiently to bootstrap liquidity pools (on Bancor) for index products. It is absolutely key that we have effective liquidity management solutions for our index products particularly as our catalogue of products grow. \n\nFurther, the main risk we see in providing this level of liquidity is that the IL protection will not be solely covered by TKN and actually some BNT will be required to fully cover our IL. We don't see this as a drawback as we are happy to hold some BNT on our balance sheet being that it is one of the most liquid tokens in crypto.\n\nIt goes without saying that we will be moving all our liquidity to Bancor 3 as soon as it is live. \n\n### FOR\nIncrease trading liquidity in the PHTR pool from 400,000 BNT to 800,000 BNT.\n\n### AGAINST\nKeep the trading liquidity in the PHTR pool at 400,000 BNT.",

Make sure to stake your vBNT for voting before this date and time to participate in the DAO decision.\n\n# TL;DR\n\n* Proposal to whitelist SATA.\n\n* Trading Liquidity Limit of 50,000 BNT.\n\n* There are no security concerns that could prohibit whitelist status.\n\n* There is no reason to doubt the legitimacy of the Signata project.\n\n* The benefit to Bancor is clear. Providing SATA liquidity will attract token LPs from the Signata community to swap on Bancor, and increase protocol trade volume.\n\n### Token Address: [0x3ebb4A4e91Ad83BE51F8d596533818b246F4bEe1 ](https://etherscan.io/address/0x3ebb4A4e91Ad83BE51F8d596533818b246F4bEe1)\n\n### Project Website: [Signata](https://sata.technology/)\n\n# Liquidity\n\nThe Deepest SATA pools are:\n\nThe SATA/ETH 0.3% Uniswap v2 pool with $611,162 liquidity, $10,880 daily volume [1].\n\nThe SATA/WETH 0.3% Sushiswap pool with $221,491.80 liquidity, $4,775.43 daily volume [2].\n\nThe SATA/ETH 1% Uniswap v3 pool with $25.02k liquidity, $0 daily volume [3].\n\nA trading liquidity limit of 50,000BNT opens up space for at least $242k of liquidity in the pool, with BNT at $2.42. If the pool space is filled, a proposal to increase the trading liquidity limit can be proposed.\n\n# Token Security\n\nSATA does not have an elastic supply, or rebase mechanism. The SATA token has a current total supply of 100,000,000 SATA. Contracts are standard ERC-20 OpenZeppelin contracts. The contracts don’t have admin privileges that grant unrestricted minting or burning of tokens. Token contract owner has been set to 0x00...000.\n\nThe top 15 contract and addresses with the highest concentration of SATA are the DireWolf DWS Burn contracts, the token contract deployer, null address, Uniswap v2 SATA/ETH pool, Sushiswap SATA/ETH pool, fee distribution contracts, team wallets, and wallets with 0.7195%, 0.7141%, 0.5994%, and 0.4674% of supply.\n\n\n\n# Project\n\nThe Signata project aims to deliver a full suite of blockchain-powered identity and access control solutions, including hardware token integration and a marketplace of smart contracts for integration with 3rd party service providers.\n\nSignata uses Non-Fungible Tokens to represent rights of holders, and will deploy on multiple chains to encourage adoption of the services its building. Signata is currently available in production at https://signata.net/, but an overhauled web3 application is currently in active development at https://signata-web-fpgof.ondigitalocean.app/. The new web3-connected application will replace https://signata.net/ when it has completed development and testing.\n\nThe project also maintains all token information and service information at https://sata.technology/\n\nThe project's focus is on building privacy-focused identity services for consumers. The project will be launching a full web 2.0 OpenID Connect service derived from the open source project [Keycloak](https://keycloak.org), adding web3 connectivity during user authentication and connection to Identities and Rights issued on the blockchain. Users can maintain their privacy by not revealing their wallet information directly to the services that they are connecting to, and using separate identities for each online \"persona\" they wish to use. The Signata project is also working with projects specialised in developing blockchain privacy services to expand its offerings for users.\n\nRoadmap can be found [here](https://trello.com/b/IJVDJZ39/sata-roadmap).\n\n# Tokenomics\n\nThe project's original plans for token releases were to unlock 2.5 million tokens every 3 months. Currently 37.5 million tokens are still locked in [team.finance](https://www.team.finance/view-coin/0x3ebb4A4e91Ad83BE51F8d596533818b246F4bEe1?name=Signata&symbol=SATA) according to the original schedule.\n\nAs the project decided to move its operation to a DAO instead, the majority of the currently unlocked and non-circulating supply will instead be moved to the DAO once it has been deployed (approximately 70% of the total supply). As tokens from the original token unlock schedule are unlocked in the future, they will be transferred to the DAO treasury as the locks expire.\n\n10% of the supply on Ethereum was burned as 10 million tokens were minted for the BSC-equivalent SATA token. As the project expands to more alternative chains, any supply created on those chains will be burned from BSC or ETH, depending on where the most available supply is sitting at the time of expansion.\n\n# Community and Communication\n\nSignata is active on [Telegram](https://t.me/satatoken), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/satatoken), and [Discord](https://discord.gg/pEJu4ZjnfX). The Congruent Labs team also operates official [Blog](https://blog.congruentlabs.co/), and [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/company/congruent-labs-pty-ltd/) accounts. The CongruentLabs [Github](https://github.com/congruentlabs) shows a latest commit on the Signata repository on the 2nd of February, at the time of writing.\n\n# Available Audits\n\nNo audit has been completed yet. An audit of the periphery contracts (SignataIdentity, SignataRight) to the main contract will be performed once the main product release has been completed. As the ERC20 token contract is almost a pure OpenZeppelin implementation it wasn't prioritised for audit.\n\n# Market and Trading Data\n\n* SATA's price at the time of writing is $0.3202.\n\n* All-time high: $0.7596 (5th Jan 2022).\n\n* All-time low: $0.06817 (1st Apr 2021).\n\n* Price 90 days ago: $0.2952.\n\n* 36,344,292.20 SATA in circulation, with a max and total supply of 100,000,000 SATA.\n\n* The current market capitalization is $11,659,755.\n\n* The SATA token is available on, Uniswap v2, Uniswap v3, Sushiswap and TimeX.\n\n[1] https://v2.info.uniswap.org/pair/0xbc00e708c407d7633f7504434e74c13e171de7f1\n\n[2] https://analytics.sushi.com/pairs/0x1976bf5cc90bac01e3ae21a6e5971a393638bcfa\n\n[3] https://info.uniswap.org/#/pools/0xe72d262158f402faf553179b2b4aff23dfad6d4c\n\n[4] https://etherscan.io/token/0x3ebb4A4e91Ad83BE51F8d596533818b246F4bEe1#balances",

If full, the Bancor FODL pool would only have 18.47% of the liquidity in the FODL/USDC Sushiswap pool. Therefore, if it happens, a proposal to increase the trading liquidity limit again should be considered.\n\nFOR\n\nIncrease trading liquidity in the FODL pool from 100k BNT to 250k BNT.\n\nAGAINST\n\nKeep the trading liquidity in the FODL pool at 100k BNT.\n\n[1] [FODL-USDC | SushiSwap Analytics](https://analytics.sushi.com/pairs/0xa5c475167f03b1556c054e0da78192cd2779087f)\n\n[2] [FODL-WETH | SushiSwap Analytics](https://analytics.sushi.com/pairs/0xce7e98d4da6ebda6af474ea618c6b175729cd366)",

Additionally, the TEMP token was also whitelisted on SpookySwap (Fantom) and is being actively traded on there now. Finally, we have updated our [documentation](https://docs.tempus.finance/) with an overview of our roadmap for 2022 and beyond.\n\n**Trading Liquidity Limit Increase Justification**\n\nThe TEMP-BNT pool has already amassed ~$446k (as of 28 February 2022) of liquidity, which means there is insufficient balance in the pool. Clearly, our community has more demand to participate in the Bancor pool. An increase in trading liquidity limit to 500k BNT will bring it closer in line with the liquidity available on other DEXs, enabling Bancor to strengthen the partnership with Tempus and continue to grow Bancor’s TVL.\n\nWe see Bancor being a key DEX to trade the TEMP token and looking forward to deepening our relationship for the long term.\n\n**[[Update 1/3/2022: We have also [proposed](https://forum.tempus.finance/t/proposal-fund-the-temp-bnt-pool-on-bancor-with-approx-750k-in-temp/135) to allocate $750,000 worth of TEMP to the Bancor pool upon it being increased**\n\n**Tempus News Highlights Since Last Proposal**\n\n* [Tempus Launches on Fantom](https://medium.com/tempusfinance/tempus-launches-on-fantom-6a7c8810c51d)\n* [Tempus Deep Dive](https://medium.com/tempusfinance/deep-dive-into-tempus-economics-e1e857ac8ee2)\n\n\n**FOR**\n\nIncrease TEMP Trading Liquidity to 500k BNT from 100k BNT\n\n**AGAINST**\n\nKeep TEMP Trading Liquidity at 100k BNT",

The impact of a token being exploited, or manipulated, is isolated to the respective market, rather than the protocol.\n\nEach lending market supports two assets only; the bridge token and a unique token. This design concentrates liquidity in single pools and allows for efficiency. Silo's markets are permissionless and therefore any token asset can have a borrow/lend market.\n\nMore information can be found on the Silo Finance [Gitbook](https://resources.silo.finance/welcome-to-silo/protocol-overview).\n\n# Tokenomics\n\n### Token Allocation and Release\n\nOver the next 4 years, 1B [$SILO](https://etherscan.io/address/0x6f80310ca7f2c654691d1383149fa1a57d8ab1f8) tokens will be minted without the possibility of future inflation.

      "title": "Change the fee in the DAI pool from 1.5% to 1%",
      "content": "For this proposal to pass, it requires a 20% quorum and 66.7% supermajority.\n\n### TLDR\n\n* This proposal seeks to decrease the pool fee on the DAI pool from 1.5% to 1%.\n* The increase came as a continuation of the stablepool fee experiment [1].\n* Performance of the DAI pool has lowered w.r.t. fees and volume, justifying the decrease as part of the stablepool fees experiment.\n* The goal is to increase APYs not only for the DAI pool but also indirectly to other pools which might see more volume coming from swaps that involve DAI.\n\n### Abstract\n\nThe effect on pool fees has been thoroughly analysed in the past weeks by the DAO and our team of analysts. Changing the pool fee in the TRAC pool has been a success so far, with APRs increasing for all LPs in the pool.\nThe TRAC experiment finished - resulting data can be found in the data analysis governance post [2], which showed that a 1-4% fee resulted in more fees accrued compared to 0.2% and 0.5%.\n\nThe stablepool fee experiment aimed to increase the pool fees of the USDC, USDT and DAI pools, and use the DAI pool as a control. When the experiment finished, the fees in the first two pools were increased based on data analysis, and the DAI pool fee was changed to further experiment with a stablepool fee. DAI pool’s weekly volume and fees since the end of August are shown in Figures 1 and 2. Average Daily Volume and Fees collected at different pool fees is showed - the graph doesn’t include market share above and below the swap fee changes and captures relatively long periods of time. The fee was set at 0.2% on the DAI pool during periods of higher volume/volatility. Therefore, although a good benchmark to analyse pool performance, average daily volume and fee at different swap fees shouldn’t be taken **solely** into consideration when deciding what fees to set the pools.\n\n![Screenshot 2022-02-23 at 09.29.34|690x169](upload://8cpGwdrEW18inBQtT1jVvxIoIas.png)\nFigure 1 - Weekly DAI pool volume since the end of August 2021.\n\n![Screenshot 2022-02-23 at 09.29.07|690x171](upload://tIBojouPmSlvmJ1IOGQCOQfvQC9.png)\nFigure 2 - Weekly DAI pool fees since the end of August 2021.\n\n![image|690x382](upload://y1wGLAn6jKkrPn4uueeRUvvyJ5Z.jpeg)\nFigure 3 - Average Daily Volume and Fee at different pool fees. Data until the 3rd of February.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nData on volume and fees accrued in the pool justifies a decrease in the DAI pool fee, as collected fees have lowered since the change. The decrease in the pool fee will also have an effect on token swaps that involve DAI. This decrease is part of the stablepool experiment, and the pool performance will be continuously tracked - with further modifications proposed to the DAO when needed.\n\nFor\n1. Increase the pool fee in the DAI pool from 1.5% to 1%.\n\nAgainst\n1. Keep the pool fee in the DAI pool at 1.5%.\n\n[1] https://gov.bancor.network/t/proposal-change-stablepool-fees-usdt-usdc-dai-to-1-0-1-0-and-1-5-respectively/3357\n[2] https://gov.bancor.network/t/trac-pool-fee-changes/3353",

      "title": "Proposal to Whitelist FODL Finance (FODL) with 100,000 BNT trading liquidity limit",
      "content": "For this proposal to pass, it requires a 35% quorum and 66.7% supermajority.\n\n# TL;DR\n\n* Proposal to whitelist FODL.\n\n* Trading Liquidity Limit of 100,000 BNT.\n\n* There are no security concerns that could prohibit whitelist status.\n\n* There is no reason to doubt the legitimacy of the FODL Finance project.\n\n* The benefit to Bancor is clear. Providing FODL liquidity will attract token LPs from the FODL Finance community to swap on Bancor, and increase protocol trade volume. Further integrations once FODL is whitelisted can be pursued as well.\n\n### Token Address: [0x4c2e59d098df7b6cbae0848d66de2f8a4889b9c3](https://etherscan.io/address/0x4c2e59d098df7b6cbae0848d66de2f8a4889b9c3)\n\n### Project Website: [Fodl Finance](https://fodl.finance/)\n\n# Liquidity\n\nThe Deepest FODL pools on Ethereum are:\n\nThe FODL/USDC 0.3% SushiSwap pool with $8,899,060.39 liquidity, $170,132.21 daily volume, and an extrapolated APR (not counting IL downside) from the 24hr fees of 2.09% [1].\n\nThe FODL/WETH 0.3% SushiSwap pool with $7,727,808.40 liquidity, $248,774.39 daily volume, and an extrapolated APR (not counting IL downside) from the 24hr fees of 3.53% [2].\n\nA trading liquidity limit of 100,000 BNT opens up space for at least $540k of liquidity in the pool, with BNT at $2.70. If the pool space is filled, a proposal to increase the trading liquidity limit should be proposed, as there are two much deeper FODL pools on Ethereum.\n\n# Token Security\n\nFODL does not have an elastic supply, or rebase mechanism. The FODL token has a current total supply of 1,000,000,000 FODL. Contracts are standard ERC-20 OpenZeppelin contracts. The contracts don’t have admin privileges that grant unrestricted burning of tokens.\n\nThe top 15 contract and addresses with the highest concentration of FODL are Platform position rewards timelock contract Decentralized development grants timelock contract, Team Fund timelock contract, xFODL staking rewards contract, FODL single-sided staking contract, Sushiswap FODL/USDC pool contract, Sushiswap FODL/WETH pool contract, and wallets with 1.7938%, 1.3147%, 1.2695%, 1.1937%, 0.9314%, 0.8502%, and 0.4762% of the FODL supply.\n\n# Project\n\nThe Fodl platform combines several money \"legos\" of the DeFi ecosystem - flash loans and collateral lending platforms, combined with proprietary position protection bots and cross-asset price indexing - to build a **fully decentralized leverage trading platform** .\n\nFodl enables traders to utilize leverage for their trades without paying a funding rate. This leverage is derived from existing DeFi building blocks, **Compound and Aave** . In essence, traditional DeFi borrow/lend platforms are turned into money markets providing users with leverage by margining your assets to yourself. Our motto is: Be your own funding rate!\n\nAdditionally, Fodl follows a decentralized ethos of **transparency, low fees, user autonomy and distributed revenue distribution** . All positions and calculations are handled **on-chain** using live market data, users maintain the keys to their positions and do not send funds to a central pool, or protocol, and Fodl fee revenue is distributed entirely to Fodl LPs via buybacks - essentially decentralizing all protocol revenue. Not your keys, not your coins.\n\nMore information can be found in the Fodl Finance [Gitbook](https://fodl-1.gitbook.io/fodl-1/).\n\n# Tokenomics\n\nThe FODL token serves as both a governance token for the fully decentralized protocol DAO, as well as a vehicle for fully decentralized revenue distribution. Token supply will never be changed, and supply distribution is as follows:\n\n* Total supply: 1,000,000,000 FODL\n\n* Initial DEX listing LP: 200,000,000 FODL\n\n* Initial Price: $0.025\n\n* Initial FDV: $25,000,000\n\n* Platform position rewards: 400,000,000 FODL\n\n* Treasury: Funded via Fodl buybacks\n\n* FODL LP staking rewards: 150,000,000 FODL\n\n* xFODL staking rewards: 50,000,000 FODL\n\n* Decentralized development grants: 100,000,000 FODL\n\n* Team funding: 100,000,000 FODL\n\n### Vesting Periods\n\n* The initial LP and LP Staking rewards are locked for 6 months in the LP after Project inception.\n\n* Team Fund is vesting over 18 Months linearly with a 6 months cliff.\n\n# Community and Communication\n\nFodl Finance is active on [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/GHB9vmz9hv). The Fodl Finance team also operates official [Twitter](https://twitter.com/FODLfi), and [Medium](https://medium.com/@FODL) accounts.\n\n# Available Audits\n\nFodl Finance has been audited by [Quantstamp](https://certificate.quantstamp.com/full/fodl).\n\n# Market and Trading Data\n\n* FODL's price at the time of writing is $0.218431.\n\n* All-time high: $1.11 (20th Oct 2021).\n\n* All-time low: $0.151864 (27th Jan 2022).\n\n* Price 90 days ago: $0.478049.\n\n* 251,254,342 FODL in circulation, with a max and total supply of 1,000,000,000 FODL.\n\n* The current market capitalization is $55,037,273.\n\n* The FODL token is available on, among others, Sushiswap, Quickswap, BKEX, Hoo.com, MEXC Global, LBank, Gate.io, BTSE, CoinEx, Bibox, CoinW, BingX, .\n\n[1] https://analytics.sushi.com/pairs/0xa5c475167f03b1556c054e0da78192cd2779087f\n\n[2] https://analytics.sushi.com/pairs/0xce7e98d4da6ebda6af474ea618c6b175729cd366\n\n[3] https://etherscan.io/token/0x4c2e59d098df7b6cbae0848d66de2f8a4889b9c3#balances\n",

Analysis of fee changes the DAO has made up to the present suggest we are still in the noise - in general, fee changes make zero difference to trade volumes, and understandably so. To a wide variety of users, the difference between a 0.2% and a 0.5% swap fee is essentially zero. More importantly, lower fees to drive higher volume is not commensurate with increased returns; Uniswap v3 has attained some truly remarkable volumes, but is currently running at a $20M loss. This i…\n\n[/quote]\n\nThe TRAC experiment finished and resulting data can be found in the [data analysis governance post](https://gov.bancor.network/t/trac-pool-fee-changes/3353), and showed that a 1-4% fee resulted in more fees accrued compared to 0.2% and 0.5%.\n\nIncreasing the pool fee will help siphon more profits from arbitrageurs to the protocol, most likely not affect volume and therefore increase APYs for the LPs in the pool and protocol-earned fees.\n\nFurthermore, an increase in the SNX pool APY might attract more liquidity to the pool. If the pool gets full, a proposal to increase the trading liquidity limit can be proposed, as the Bancor SNX pool is not the deepest on Ethereum.\n\nThese reasons justify an increase of the pool fee, and the pool performance will be closely observed if the proposal passes to understand if a consequent decrease in the pool fee is justified.\n\nFor\n\n1. Increase the pool fee in the SNX pool from 0.2% to 1%.\n\nAgainst\n\n1. Keep the pool fee in the SNX pool at 0.2%.\n\n[1] https://app.balancer.fi/#/pool/0x072f14b85add63488ddad88f855fda4a99d6ac9b000200000000000000000027\n[2] https://etherscan.io/address/0xb0536a57a8D8f5327C62d0fECbA23C5a27b5118b\n[3] https://analytics.sushi.com/pairs/0xa1d7b2d891e3a1f9ef4bbc5be20630c2feb1c470\n[4] https://v2.info.uniswap.org/pair/0x43ae24960e5534731fc831386c07755a2dc33d47\n[5] https://info.uniswap.org/#/pools/0xede8dd046586d22625ae7ff2708f879ef7bdb8cf",

      "content": "For this proposal to pass, it requires a 35% quorum and 66.7% supermajority.\n\nThis proposal is expected to appear on Snapshot for voting on\nFebruary 13, 2022 (London) . Make sure to stake your vBNT for voting before this date and time to participate in the DAO decision.\n\n## TL;DR\n* The pool has space for 8,721 PHTR or roughly ~$1,268.\n* This proposal seeks to increase the trading liquidity limit in the PHTR pool from 100,000 BNT to 400,000 BNT.\n* The proposed trading liquidity limit would open space for roughly 5.3m PHTR to be staked single-sided.\n* The Phuture Finance team has staked BNT in the PHTR pool to open up space for non-treasury stakes to benefit from single-sided staking and impermanent loss protection.\n* Phuture Finance would stake 5m PHTR (roughly $720,000) in the pool when the space opens.\n\n## Rationale\nDEX liquidity on Ethereum\n\nThe PHTR pools with deepest liquidity in Ethereum DEXes are:\n* The PHTR 1% pool on Bancor v2.1 with $691,526 liquidity, and an extrapolated APY from the fees accrued in the past 24 hours of 10.98% [1].\n* The PHTR/USDC 0.3% pool on Sushiswap with $129,797.20 liquidity, and an extrapolated APY from the fees accrued in the past 24 hours of 36.28% [2].\n* The PHTR/WETH 0.3% pool on Sushiswap with $93,930.28 liquidity, and an extrapolated APY from the fees accrued in the past 24 hours of 5.77% [3].\n\nThe extra liquidity would bring the total trading liquidity to at least $1,004,000 if it is full, with BNT at $2.51. This would bring the total depth of the pool to over $2mm making it by far the most liquid venue to exchange PHTR.\n\n## DAO controlled liquidity\n\nThe PhutureDAO intends to immediately fill the new trading limit if it is approved. This would ensure that the capital in the pool was backed by the DAO and therefore would remain staked regardless of market conditions. This gives PHTR holders confidence that they can always efficiently buy and sell their PHTR on Bancor at any time.\n\nFrom PhutureDAO’s perspective this trading limit increase symbolises our commitment to using Bancor as not only our primary liquidity provider on Ethereum, but also our commitment to using Bancor as our treasury management solution. Bancor will allow us to maintain the same composition of treasury assets through single-sided staking, keep intact the buy and hold return profile of our PHTR with IL protection and allow us to be productive with the PHTR through fee generation.\n\n## Additional commitment to Bancor 3\n\nPhuture intends to move all liquidity over to Bancor 3 as soon as it goes live. We are also considering participating in the Bancor LM matching programme when Bancor 3 goes live!\n\nFOR\n\nIncrease trading liquidity in the PHTR pool from 100,000 BNT to 400,000 BNT.\n\nAGAINST\n\nKeep the trading liquidity in the PHTR pool at 100,000 BNT.",

      "content": "## TLDR\n* This proposal seeks to increase the pool fees on the MKR pool from 0.2% to 1%.\n* An increased pool fee will help siphon more profits from arbitrageurs to the protocol and most likely not affect volume therefore increasing APYs for the LPs in the pool.\n* Increased APYs in the pool along with Impermanent Loss Protection will help gather interest from the mStable community to stake on Bancor and fill the remaining space in the pool.\n\n## Abstract\n\nDeepest MKR DEX pools on Ethereum are:\n\nThe MKR/WETH 60%/40% 0.26% (Dynamic fee) Balancer pool with $20,961,101 liquidity and 24hr APR (not considering IL downside) of 1.46% [1].\nThe MKR/WETH Sushiswap pool with $15,621,536.56 liquidity and 24hr APR (not considering IL downside) of 3.05% [2].\nThe MKR/ETH 0.3% Uniswap v3 pool with $15.15m liquidity and 24hr APR (not considering IL downside) of 12.55% [3].\nThe MKR/ETH 0.3% Uniswap v2 pool with $11,942,800 liquidity and 24hr APR (not considering IL downside) of 2.88% [4].\nThe MKR/ETH 0.2% Bancor pool with $6,514,402 liquidity and 24hr APR (with no IL) of 1.37% [5].\n\n## Motivation\n\nThe effect on pool fees has been thoroughly analysed in the past weeks by the DAO and our team of analysts. Changing the pool fee in the TRAC pool has been a success so far, with APRs increasing for all LPs in the pool.\nThe TRAC experiment finished and resulting data can be found in the data analysis governance post [6], and showed that a 1-4% fee resulted in more fees accrued compared to 0.2% and 0.5%.\n\nIdeally, these experiments and changes should happen for tokens that Bancor dominates the liquidity of. The reasons to pursue a higher fee in the MKR pool are:\n\n* Potentially attract more LPs to the pool, as there is space for 1,890 MKR to be staked single-sided, with no impermanent loss.\n* The majority of the MKR pools in other DEXes have a 0.3% fee set, whereas the Bancor MKR pool is set to 0.2%. As the trades on Bancor involve two hops, this situation might be ideal as the ETH pool fee is set to 0.1%, at the time of writing. However, it is worth experimenting with it in order to attract more LPs to the pool and raise awareness about Bancor with the Maker community.\n* Furthermore, the market for MKR on AAVE has 50,000 MKR ($120m) total liquidity earning 0.3% with 65% LTV (as most are borrowing 50%, around $60m) and earning 10% on stable farming >> 5-6% APY on their MKR. Raising the fee for this pool can potentially outperform AAVE and bring more MKR LPs to Bancor for set and forget experience, with no risks of liquidation and impermanent loss.\n* Increasing the pool fee will help siphon more profits from arbitrageurs to the protocol.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nTherefore, an increase in the MKR pool APY might attract more liquidity to the pool. If the pool space is occupied, the MKR pool on Bancor would have one of the deepest liquidity in any Ethereum DEX. A trading liquidity limit increase can be considered if the pool space is filled.\n\nFor\n\n    Increase the pool fee in the MKR pool from 0.2% to 1%.\n\nAgainst\n\n    Keep the pool fee in the MKR pool at 0.2%.\n",

      "title": " Extend LM rewards in the Stablepools (USDC, USDT, DAI) for 8 weeks from the 23rd February 2022",
      "content": "To pass, this proposal needs 35% quorum and 66.7% supermajority.\n\n# TL;DR\n1. The LM rewards on stablecoin pools (DAI, USDC, USDT) are extended from the 23rd February 2022 until 20th April 2022 (another 8 weeks), and can continue being extended by the DAO.Current stable tokens liquidity is essential to stay in the ecosystem to maintain the protocol momentum and support the migration of liquidity from Bancor v2.1 to Bancor 3.\n\n2. The LM rewards are being extended to maintain current stable pools protocol liquidity in anticipation of Bancor 3. Bancor should not lose the momentum and cut out the LM rewards on stablecoins.\n3. To support a flawless migration, a new liquidity mining program will be released together with the Bancor 3 release. A proposal to create a Dual LM rewards programme with BNT being emitted over 24 months has passed through the BancorDAO Governance Forum and Snapshot [1][2].\n\n# Discussion\n\n* At this stage, current protocol growth requires LM to maintain the momentum and stay competitive in the space.\n* After achieving the position of market leader in both TVL and volume, LM extension will no longer be necessary, and the voting for LM extensions may be concluded.\n* Bancor 3 will significantly reduce the pressure resulting from insurance on all the assets, and should increase the protocol revenue from trading fees.\n* A large majority of the LM rewards are re-staked to the protocol, increasing the TVL and the space available for TKN deposits with single sided exposure. If this trend continues, the LM program is more of an asset than a liability, and can be managed more assertively. Bancor 3 will feature reward auto-compounding - LM can therefore be a mechanism to increase liquidity in the pools. 33,620,099 BNT Rewards have been re-staked vs 15,359,874 BNT rewards that have been claimed.\n\n* In the long term, Bancor is aiming towards sustainable annual inflation of 2%, in order to achieve that, Bancor requires significant volume and Vortex to be applied.\n\n\n# Volume, fees, 24hr APR and weekly APR\n\nWeekly volume and fees from the USDC, DAI and USDT pools from the week of the 30th of August have been consistent. The DAO has been running experiments with the swap fee in the stablepools.\n\n\nSince January 11th, the weekly APR for the DAI, USDC and USDT have been in the ranges:\nDAI: 2% to 13%\nUSDC: 6% to 33%\nUSDT: 4.5% to 26%\n\nThis post is very similar to the previous stablepool LM extension [6], as the arguments to extend it then are very similar to the ones now ahead of B3 release.\n\nFOR\nExtend LM rewards for the USDC, USDT and DAI pools for 8 weeks from the 23rd February 2022.\n\nAGAINST\nDo not extend the LM rewards for the USDC, USDT and DAI pools.\n\n[1] https://gov.bancor.network/t/proposal-addendum-incentivize-users-to-migrate-to-v3-by-matching-token-side-lm-rewards-with-up-to-50-000-bnt-per-pool/3355\n[2] https://snapshot.org/#/bancornetwork.eth/proposal/0x41c9e56d73dcbdc3311491e7f4dd991e0683eb28d2656f039f6c02108ace5e04\n[3] https://gov.bancor.network/t/proposal-stablecoin-pools-fee-experiment-and-analysis/3292\n[4] https://gov.bancor.network/t/proposal-change-stablepool-fees-usdt-usdc-dai-to-1-0-1-0-and-1-5-respectively/3357\n[5] https://dune.xyz/queries/30793/62118\n[6] https://gov.bancor.network/t/extend-lm-rewards-in-the-stablepools-usdc-usdt-dai-for-6-weeks/3282\n",

      "title": "Extension of Liquidity Mining on WBTC, LINK and ETH pools",
      "content": "The LM rewards schedule for ETH, LINK, WBTC is due to end in less than 2 weeks. To maintain liquidity in the near term, and to sustain liquidity while Bancor prepares new products and upgrades, wherein it is proposed to extend the LM rewards program on these pools for a further 8 weeks with conditions to stop if the V3 is released.\n\n1. ETH, LINK, and WBTC will continue to receive emissions of 100-200K BNT per week, for an additional 8 weeks.\n2. Upon release of the V3, a new LM incentives program may be considered by the DAO. Therefore the current liquidity mining plan will be stopped to incentivise migration.\n\n## Discussion\n\n1. Around 75% of tokens have been restaked back into the pools; therefore, the LM rewards have increased the space for single-sided TKN deposits, resulting in growth of the network, rather than creating a sell pressure.\n2. The above 3 pools hold the majority of the protocol TVL, therefore curation of these pools is essential to maintain the position of the Bancor protocol on the market.\n3. The 3 mentioned above pools drive most of the volume on the ecosystem, and also present reasonable impermanent loss liability.\n4. The pools should be curated until the new V3 design is released so the funds are migrated without loss of significant TVL prior the protocol upgrade\n\n## Summary\n\n1. At this stage, current protocol growth requires LM to maintain the momentum and stay competitive in the space (the DAO seems aware of this).\n2. After releasing the V3 and supporting the smooth liquidity migration, LM extension will no longer be necessary, and the voting for LM extensions may be concluded.\n3. A large majority of the LM rewards are re-staked to the protocol, increasing the TVL and the space available for TKN deposits with single sided exposure. If this trend continues, the LM program is more of an asset than a liability, and can be managed more assertively.\n4. In the long term, Bancor is aiming towards sustainable annual inflation of 4%, in order to achieve that, Bancor requires significant volume and Vortex to be applied.\n5. **Extension of LM rewards on ETH, WBTC and LINK for 8 weeks will provide 1,200,000 - 2,400,000 BNTs as rewards, (depends on the multiplier).\n\nThis proposal is very similar to the one here: Proposal: Extend Liquidity Mining for BTC/ETH/LINK 2 and Proposal: Extend Liquidity Mining Rewards for WBTC, LINK and ETH pools. The arguments in favour of LM extension for the large caps pools then are still valid for a recent LM extension.",

Analysis of fee changes the DAO has made up to the present suggest we are still in the noise - in general, fee changes make zero difference to trade volumes, and understandably so. To a wide variety of users, the difference between a 0.2% and a 0.5% swap fee is essentially zero. More importantly, lower fees to drive higher volume is not commensurate with increased returns; Uniswap v3 has attained some truly remarkable volumes, but is currently running at a $20M loss. This i…\n\n[/quote]\n\nThe TRAC experiment finished and resulting data can be found in the [data analysis governance post](https://gov.bancor.network/t/trac-pool-fee-changes/3353), and showed that a 1-4% fee resulted in more fees accrued compared to 0.2% and 0.5%.\n\nIncreasing the pool fee will help siphon more profits from arbitrageurs to the protocol, most likely not affect volume and therefore increase APYs for the LPs in the pool and protocol-earned fees. The Bancor TRAC pool is a perfect example of such a situation (Figure 2 to 4). Increasing the pool fee significantly increased APY for all LPs in the pool, and attracted more liquidity making the TRAC pool the dominant source of liquidity for TRAC on Ethereum (89.1%).\n\nFor\n\n1. Increase the pool fee in the REQ pool from 0.2% to 1%.\n\nAgainst\n\n1. Keep the pool fee in the REQ pool at 0.2%.\n\n[1] https://v2.info.uniswap.org/pair/0x4a7d4be868e0b811ea804faf0d3a325c3a29a9ad\n\n[2] https://etherscan.io/address/0x483F65300b6Cb6f211aAB39229d494E59Fe24E66 ",

Tempus has integrated with DeFi blue chips such as Lido Finance, Compound, Aave, Yearn Finance and Rari Capital.\n\n* The benefit to Bancor is clear. Providing TEMP liquidity will attract token LPs from the Tempus Finance community to swap on Bancor, and increase protocol trade volume. Further integrations once TEMP is whitelisted can be pursued as well.\n\n### Token Address: [0xa36fdbbae3c9d55a1d67ee5821d53b50b63a1ab9](https://etherscan.io/address/0xa36fdbbae3c9d55a1d67ee5821d53b50b63a1ab9)\n\n### Project Website: [Tempus Finance](https://tempus.finance/)\n\n# Liquidity\n\nThe Deepest TEMP pools are:\n\nThe TEMP/USDC 0.3% Uniswap v3 pool with $5.93m liquidity, $37.64k daily volume, and an extrapolated APR from the 24hr fees of 2.32% [1].\n\nThe TEMP/WETH 80%/20% Balancer v2 pool with $4,666,180 liquidity, $53,872 daily volume, and an extrapolated APR from the 24hr fees of 1.13% [2].\n\nA trading liquidity limit of 100,000BNT opens up space for at least $462k of liquidity in the pool, with BNT at $2.31. If the pool space is filled, a proposal to increase the trading liquidity limit can be proposed, as there are two much deeper TEMP pools on Ethereum.\n\n# Token Security\n\nTEMP does not have an elastic supply, or rebase mechanism. The TEMP token has a current total supply of 1,000,000,000 TEMP. Contracts are standard ERC-20 OpenZeppelin contracts. The contracts don't have admin privileges that grant unrestricted burning of tokens. Minting is allowed but is restricted to 2% of total supply per year.\n\nThe top 15 contract and addresses with the highest concentration of TEMP are Vesting and Proxy contracts, the Balancer TEMP/WETH 80%/20% vault contract, the Uniswap v3 USDC/TEMP pool contract, team wallets, Hats Finance Vault contract, and wallets with 1.2510%, 1.2500% and 0.1801% of supply.\n\n\n# Project\n\nTempus is a future yield tokenization and fixed rate protocol.\n\nMost forms of yield farming return a variable rate of yield. This means that depositors can be subject to unpredictable fluctuations in their returns. Currently, there is no easy capital efficient way to obtain a fixed yield or otherwise speculate on the receivable rewards.\n\nThis is where Tempus steps in. Tempus has three different use cases, each of which offers a unique value proposition:\n\n1. Fix your future yield using any supported Yield Bearing Token (such as stETH, cDai).\n\n2. Speculate on the rate of future yield of any supported Yield Bearing Token.\n\n3. Provide liquidity to earn additional swap fees (on top of yield earned through yield farming protocols) by depositing any supported Yield Bearing Token.\n\n# Tokenomics\n\nTEMP is the Tempus ERC-20 native token. It serves three roles: governance, staking to receive a share in network fees, and paying protocol fees. 1 billion TEMP tokens were minted at genesis and will become available over the course of three years.\n\n### Governance\n\nTEMP holders can propose changes to the protocol via the [Forum](https://forum.tempus.finance/) and [Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/tempusgov.eth), including adjusting protocol-level fees, and treasury management.\n\nTEMP holders will also be able to vote on how to spend funds that have accrued to the Tempus Treasury.\n\n### Staking\n\nTempus will earn fees from underlying trading activity in its pools. TEMP holders will be able to enable fees on deposits, withdrawals, and swaps on Tempus.\n\nA portion of these fees will accrue to the Tempus Treasury, while some of them will accrue directly to those who stake their TEMP (Note; this is not yet released).\n\n### Protocol Fees\n\nIf TEMP holders vote to enable fees on deposits, withdrawals, and swaps on Tempus, TEMP holders will also be able to use their TEMP to pay for these fees (instead of paying in e.g. Ethereum).\n\nOf the 1 billion TEMP minted at genesis, 70M TEMP were sold (and immediately unlocked) in a fair launch auction in November 2021. The remaining 930M TEMP will unlock gradually. The Tempus team has a 36-month vesting schedule and investors and advisors have a 30-month vesting schedule starting after Tempus' mainnet launch on 15 December 2021.\n\nThe TEMP tokens allocated to the Tempus Treasury (for incentives for the benefit of the Tempus ecosystem) will also unlock over a similar timeframe. Token inflation of 2% per year can also be triggered by governance after 4 years. This is to ensure there is long-term development and community support available for Tempus.\n\n\nThe Tempus Finance treasury is currently valued at $59,263,190.60.\n\n# Community and Communication\n\nTempus Finance is active on [Telegram](https://t.me/tempuschat) and [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/6gauHECShr). The Tempus Finance team also operates official [Twitter](https://twitter.com/tempusfinance), and [Medium](https://medium.com/tempusfinance) accounts. The Tempus [Github](https://github.com/tempus-finance) shows recent and active activity with the latest commit on the tempus-app repository on the 28th of January, at the time of writing.\n\n# Available Audits\n\nTempus has been audited by [Coinspect](https://www.coinspect.com/tempus-audit) and [Code4rena](https://code4rena.com/reports/2021-10-tempus/).

      "title": "Gradually increase the trading liquidity limit in the wNXM pool from 2M BNT to 10M BNT in 1M BNT increments",
      "content": "### TL;DR\n\n* This proposal seeks to increase the trading liquidity limit (TLL) in the wNXM pool from 2M BNT to 10M BNT with 1M increments happening each time the pool space is filled.\n* The pool has space for 13,663 wNXM (~$492,885) to be staked single-sided. The proposed TLL increase would allow an additional 68,232 wNXM (~$2,440,000) to be staked, with BNT at $2.44 and wNXM at $35.76.\n* This proposal is conditional on a Nexus Mutual treasury funds deployment proposal passing through their governance.\n\n### Rationale\n\n#### DEX liquidity on Ethereum\n\nThe wNXM pools with deepest liquidity in Ethereum DEXes are:\n\n* The wNXM 1% pool on Bancor with $12,254,226 liquidity, and an extrapolated APY from the fees accrued in the past 24 hours of 8.53% [1].\n\n* The wNXM/ETH 1% pool on Uniswap v3 with $4.30m liquidity, and an extrapolated APY from the fees accrued in the past 24 hours of 4.53% [2].\n\n* The wNXM/ETH 0.3% pool on Uniswap v2 with $475,624 liquidity, and an extrapolated APY from the fees accrued in the past 24 hours of 12.15% [3].\n\nThe pool has space for 13,663 wNXM (~$492,885) to be staked single-sided. The proposed initial TLL increase of 1M would allow an additional 68,232 wNXM (~$2,440,000) to be staked, with BNT at $2.44 and wNXM at $35.76.\n\nIf the pool is filled with the initial trading liquidity limit increase and already available space, it should hold a total liquidity of at least $18,119,996, 4.21x the liquidity of the second deepest wNXM pool.\n\nFurther increments would work according to the following logic:\n\n1. If the pool’s trading liquidity limit is 10M BNT, stop the increments.\n2. If the space in the pool is full within 1 month from the previous increment, increase trading liquidity limit by 1M BNT.\n3. Return to step 1.\n\nA pseudo-code for the above logic is:\n\n```\n\nwhile (trading_liquidity < 10,000,000) % BNT\n\nif (space < 300,000 AND current_time < last_time_incremented + 1 month)\n\ntrading_liquidity += 1,000,000 % BNT\n\nlast_time_incremented = current_time\n\nend\n\n```\n\n#### Volume and fee performance\n\nwNXM pool weekly Volume and Fees are presented in Figures 1 and 2, respectively.\n\nThe pool would benefit from a larger trading liquidity limit to reduce swap price impact, increase volume/fees and thus improve APY.\n\nThe Liquidity Share of wNXM dipped in November but has been steadily recovering. The volume share of wNXM on Bancor at the time of writing is 87.7%.\n\n#### Impact of a deep wNXM pool on Bancor\n\nIf the trading liquidity limit in the wNXM pool is raised to 10m BNT, the pool would have a liquidity of at least $50m (with BNT at $2.51), making it one of the deepest pools on Bancor. Therefore, the wNXM token would become a significant part of the BNT index and thus have an increased influence in the BNT price.\n\nThe Bancor community has had a very positive relationship with the Nexus Mutual community. The Nexus Mutual team is openly receptive to pool revenue optimization, and this commitment shouldn’t be taken lightly - the most recent success case of pool revenue optimization is the TRAC pool fee experiment - which has had an incredible relative performance w.r.t. fees accrued for all LPs.\n\nFOR\n\nIncrease trading liquidity gradually in the wNXM pool from 2M BNT to 10M BNT, with 1M BNT increase at a time.\n\nAGAINST\n\nKeep the trading liquidity in the wNXM pool at 2M BNT.\n\n[1] https://etherscan.io/address/0x5A29f970788F3494f6350207fc91DaD0d6e8C184\n\n[2] https://v2.info.uniswap.org/pair/0x23bff8ca20aac06efdf23cee3b8ae296a30dfd27\n\n[3] https://info.uniswap.org/#/tokens/0x0d438f3b5175bebc262bf23753c1e53d03432bde",

      "content": "# TL;DR\n\n* Proposal to onboard Rocket Pool rETH\n* Proposed trading liquidity is 250K BNT.\n* There are no apparent security concerns that would prohibit whitelist status.\n* Rocket Pool is an established platform for Ethereum 2.0 staking\n\n### Token Address: [0xae78736cd615f374d3085123a210448e74fc6393](https://etherscan.io/token/0xae78736cd615f374d3085123a210448e74fc6393)\n\n### Project Website: [rocketpool.net](https://rocketpool.net/)\n\n# Token Security\n\nrETH is minted when stakers deposit ETH into the Rocket Pool deposit pool and rETH is burnt when stakers withdraw their ETH. The rETH token value is backstopped by ETH (based on ETH collateral) and its exchange rate continually increases against ETH (based on rewards generated by Ethereum PoS). The rETH exchange rate is updated daily by the Rocket Pool Oracle DAO. The Rocket Pool Oracle DAO is a set of bonded/incentivised actors, made up of 14 high-profile members of the Ethereum staking community. Exchange rate updates require a 51% consensus. The top 10 rETH holders currently account for ~60% of the supply. These include a few large rETH investors (who have deposited ETH into the Rocket Pool protocol), Uniswap V3, and L2 gateways. Unlike most tokens, this lack of distribution is less of a problem due to the ETH backstop and liquidity provided by the Rocket Pool deposit pool. The Rocket Pool contracts do not have permissions that grant administrators unrestricted mint/burn capabilities.\n\n\n# Project\n\nRocket Pool is the first truly decentralised Ethereum staking protocol. Rocket Pool provides a liquid staking experience for Ethereum stakers; they do not need to run a validator, and they can contribute any amount of ETH. The rETH liquid staking token accumulates value against ETH over time. Simply swapping ETH for rETH (or buying it on a secondary market) provides access to Ethereum staking rewards.\n\n\n# Tokenomics\n\nrETH is the Rocket Pool protocol’s liquid staking token. The token represents a person’s stake in Ethereum’s Proof-of-Stake plus the rewards generated over time by the protocol. Rocket Pool incentivises permissionless node operators to run Ethereum PoS validators. Each Rocket Pool node operator, brings 16 ETH that is matched with 16 ETH from the Rocket Pool deposit pool, to form the 32 ETH required for Ethereum staking. Node operators also lock RPL collateral as an insurance promise to the protocol.\n\n\n# Community and Communication\n\nRocket Pool has an active community on [Discord](https://discord.gg/rocketpool) and [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/rocketpool/). The core team also operates an official [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Rocket_Pool) and [Medium](https://medium.com/rocket-pool) account. Rocket Pool source code is open source, available on [Github](https://github.com/rocket-pool), and frequently updated by the core development team. Rocket Pool’s founder David Rugendyke has been Rocket Pool’s spokesperson for 5 years and Rocket Pool’s General Manager Darren Langley also represents the project. The core team is available for the community on Discord.\n\n# Available Audits\n\nRocket Pool has been extensively audited by high-profile smart contract audit firms:\n\n• [Sigma Prime ](https://rocketpool.net/files/sigma-prime-audit.pdf)\n\n• [Consensys Diligence ](https://consensys.net/diligence/audits/2021/04/rocketpool/)\n\n• [Trail of Bits](https://github.com/trailofbits/publications/blob/master/reviews/RocketPool.pdf)\n\nRocket Pool also has an [Immunefi Bug Bounty](https://immunefi.com/bounty/rocketpool/) program in place.\n\n# Market and Trading Data\n\n* rETH’s price at the time of writing is ~$2,438 \n* All-time high $4,814.31 (1st December 2021)\n* All-time low $2,068.89 (27th January 2022)\n* 32,546 tokens in circulation\n* Theoretical maximum supply of rETH is equal to the maximum supply of Ethereum\n* The rETH token is available on Uniswap (mainnet, Arbitrum, Optimism) and Balancer (mainnet)\n* The 24-hour spot volumes range from $34k (Uniswap mainnet) to $148k (Uniswap Arbitrum)\n\n# Benefits for Bancor\n\nThe Ethereum staking market will continue to grow strongly, due to its relatively low counter-party risk. Liquid staking tokens are an important financial primitive in DeFi and have the potential to appeal more broadly. rETH is clearly developing, in terms of circulation and trade volumes, but it represents the greater choice in the liquid staking market. The project is widely known; its significant growth in a short time (370m+ in just 6 weeks) shows its potential as a leading project in the Ethereum staking market (Rocket Pool are already #2). Liquid staking tokens intrinsically fit into the DeFi landscape; as liquidity; as lending collateral; as investment vault strategies. Integration opportunities with other protocols are numerous and exciting. Rocket Pool has been active in the Ethereum community for over 5 years. During this time, it has developed a highly engaged community within Discord and on Twitter. There are certain marketing opportunities that mutually benefit Bancor and Rocket Pool.\n3\n4 / 4\n",

      "title": "Change the fee in the MTA pool from 0.3% to 1%",
      "content": "### TLDR\n\n* This proposal seeks to increase the pool fees on the MTA pool from 0.3% to 1%.\n* An increased pool fee will help siphon more profits from arbitrageurs to the protocol and most likely not affect volume therefore increasing APYs for the LPs in the pool.\n* Increased APYs in the pool along with Impermanent Loss Protection will help gather interest from the mStable community to stake on Bancor and fill the remaining space in the pool.\n\n### Abstract\n\nDeepest MTA pools on Ethereum are:\n\nThe MTA/WETH 80%/20% 0.49% (dynamic fee) Balancer v2 pool with $2,373,024 liquidity and 24hr APR of 15.24% (2.37% from swap fees, 12.87% from Liquidity Mining Rewards) [1].\n\nThe FEI/MTA 0.3% Uniswap v2 pool with $1,306,152 liquidity and 24hr APR of 1.60% [2].\n\nThe MTA/ETH 0.3% Uniswap v2 pool with $919,915 liquidity and 24hr APR of 14.72 [3].\n\nThe USDC/MTA 1% Uniswap v3 pool with $539.26k liquidity and 24hr APR of 115.74% [4].\n\nThe MTA 0.3% Bancor pool with $380,711 liquidity and 24hr APR of 0.48% [5].\n\nThe MTA/WETH 0.3% Sushiswap pool with $261,214.50 liquidity and 24hr APR of 2.77% [6].\n\nThe MTA/ETH 0.3% Uniswap v3 pool with $181.84k liquidity and 24hr APR of 7.19% [7].\n\n### Motivation\n\nAn analysis on the effect of the pool fees on pool volume conducted on the USDT/BNT pool showed that there is not enough evidence to support a linear relationship between them (Figure 1).\n\nMark’s comment on the TRAC pool fee experiment sheds some light into the topic.\n\n\n    It’s not a bad idea. Analysis of fee changes the DAO has made up to the present suggest we are still in the noise - in general, fee changes make zero difference to trade volumes, and understandably so. To a wide variety of users, the difference between a 0.2% and a 0.5% swap fee is essentially zero. More importantly, lower fees to drive higher volume is not commensurate with increased returns; Uniswap v3 has attained some truly remarkable volumes, but is currently running at a $20M loss.\n\n\nThe TRAC experiment finished and resulting data can be found in the data analysis governance post [8], and showed that a 1-4% fee resulted in more fees accrued compared to 0.2% and 0.5%.\n\nFigure 2/3 show a decrease in overall pool volume and fees since the end of November. The pool liquidity (Figure 4) has also been steadily falling since the end of the end of November 2021. A proposal to deploy MTA funds in Fei Protocol & Ondo Finance [9] meant 418,797.01 MTA was removed on the 10th of January 2022 [10].\n\nThe pool currently has space for 2,918,641 MTA to be staked single-sided.\n\nIncreasing the pool fee will help siphon more profits from arbitrageurs to the protocol, most likely not affect volume and therefore increase APYs for the LPs in the pool and protocol-earned fees. The Bancor TRAC pool is a perfect example of such a situation (Figure 5 to 7). Increasing the pool fee significantly increased APY for all LPs in the pool, and attracted more liquidity making the TRAC pool the dominant source of liquidity for TRAC on Ethereum (89.1%).\n\nTherefore, an increase in the MTA pool APY might attract more liquidity to the pool. If the pool space is occupied, the MTA pool on Bancor would have the deepest liquidity in any Ethereum DEX. A trading liquidity limit increase can then be considered.\n\nThese reasons justify an increase of the pool fee, and the pool performance will be closely observed if the proposal passes to understand if a consequent decrease in the pool fee is justified.\n\n\nFor\n\n1. Increase the pool fee in the MTA pool from 0.3% to 1%.\n\nAgainst\n\n1. Keep the pool fee in the MTA pool at 0.3%.\n\n[1] https://app.balancer.fi/#/pool/0xe2469f47ab58cf9cf59f9822e3c5de4950a41c49000200000000000000000089\n[2] https://v2.info.uniswap.org/pair/0x9241943c29eb0b1fc0f8e5b464fbc14915da9a57\n[3] https://v2.info.uniswap.org/pair/0x0d0d65e7a7db277d3e0f5e1676325e75f3340455\n[4] https://info.uniswap.org/#/pools/0xc2d5acd2f49c0ab261c58de2da3a35a23a3abbb1\n[5] https://etherscan.io/address/0xb2f71da1b104EFae99A4BD824B27B2B102Fe3ECB\n[6] https://analytics.sushi.com/pairs/0x663242d053057f317a773d7c262b700616d0b9a0\n[7] https://info.uniswap.org/#/pools/0xa96c549fa361181a94c081597171e17d27459dbb\n[8] https://gov.bancor.network/t/trac-pool-fee-changes/3353\n[9] https://forum.mstable.org/t/tdp-28-fei-protocol-ondo-finance-laas-opportunity/727\n[10] https://etherscan.io/tx/0x337eb91d6d48756398f87b62cb962a42a60b6a3eb7c5d526d847e09e9714e13b2",

Make sure to stake your vBNT for voting before this date and time to participate in the DAO decision.\n\n# TL;DR\n\n* Proposal to whitelist POOLZ.\n* Trading liquidity limit of 50,000 BNT.\n* There are no security concerns that could prohibit whitelist status.\n* There is no reason to doubt the legitimacy of the Poolz project. One of their strategic investors is Ferrum Network, has completed 78 IDOs, with a project volume of $629,246,652 in the past 30 days.\n\n* The benefit to Bancor is clear. Providing POOLZ liquidity will attract token LPs from Poolz's community to swap on Bancor, and increase protocol trade volume.\n\n### Token Address: [0x69A95185ee2a045CDC4bCd1b1Df10710395e4e23](https://etherscan.io/token/0x69A95185ee2a045CDC4bCd1b1Df10710395e4e23)\n\n### Project Website: [Poolz Finance](https://www.poolz.finance/)\n\n# Liquidity\n\nThe Deepest POOLZ pools are:\n\nThe POOLZ/ETH Uniswap v3 pool with $75.78k liquidity and a 7 day average APY of 5.95% [1].\n\nThe POOLZ/ETH Uniswap v2 pool with $1,266,215 liquidity and a 7 day average APY of 1.41% [2].\n\nA trading liquidity limit of 50,000BNT opens up space for at least $301k of liquidity in the pool, with BNT at $3.01. If the pool fills up, a trading liquidity limit increase may be proposed.\n\n# Token Security\n\nPOOLZ does not have an elastic supply, or rebase mechanism. The POOLZ token has a max supply cap of 4,992,280 POOLZ. Contracts are standard ERC-20 OpenZeppelin contracts. The contracts don’t have any permissions that grant administrators unrestricted mint/burn capabilities. The token isn’t pausable.\n\nThe top 15 contract and addresses with the highest concentration of POOLZ are Proxy and Locking contracts, Uniswap v2 POOLZ/ETH pool, Gate.io, and wallets with 39.2935% (looks like a team wallet), 0.3008%, 0.2203%, 0.1962%, 0.1877%, 0.1803%, and 0.1628% of the supply.\n\nhttps://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/bancordao/original/2X/8/808924ca72e06cf6da5319434025d0aba35a8e89.jpeg\nFigure 1 - Top 15 contract and address with the highest concentration of POOLZ [3]\n\n# Project\n\nPoolz is a decentralized cross-chain IDO platform built on top of Web 3.0 infrastructure to enable crypto projects to raise funds before listing. The Poolz platform has already integrated with many different blockchains and is in discussions with more than 10 of the biggest blockchain networks.\n\n# Tokenomics\n\nTo be eligible to participate in the IDO whitelists, you must hold POOLZ tokens, qualify under Poolz staking criteria and participate in the tasks model. The winner wallets will be posted 24 hours before the IDO time on the Poolz website.\n\nAccording to:\n\n1. Top 100, you will get guaranteed allocation in the upcoming IDOs & Pre IDOs\n\n2. 250 staked Poolz = 250 Leaderboard points (1 Lottery tickets) - wallets that only holds $POOLZ are not counted on the leaderboard.\n\n# Community and Communication\n\nPoolz Finance is active on [Telegram](https://t.me/PoolzOfficialCommunity). The Poolz Finance team also operates an official [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Poolz__) account.

      "content": "## Proposal to increase the trading liquidity limit in the CHZ pool from 20k BNT to 50k BNT\n\nFor this proposal to pass, it requires a 35% quorum and 66.7% supermajority.\n\nThis proposal is expected to appear on Snapshot for voting on [date=2022-01-30 timezone=\"Europe/Lisbon\"]. Make sure to stake your vBNT for voting before this date and time to participate in the DAO decision.\n\n### TL;DR\n\n* The pool has been full with no trading liquidity limit increase proposal since its whitelisting in June 2021.\n* Increasing the pool size would significantly reduce the price impact in the pool, offsetting increases in the pool fee.\n* The pool is currently the shallowest in any Ethereum DEX, and has been consistently full.\n* This proposal seeks to increase the trading liquidity limit in the CHZ pool from 20k BNT to 50k BNT. If the pool is filled, a new trading liquidity limit increase may be proposed.\n\n### Rationale\n\n#### DEX liquidity on Ethereum\n\nThe CHZ pools with deepest liquidity in Ethereum DEXes are:\n\n* The CHZ/USDT 0.3% pool on Uniswap v3 with $1.48m liquidity, and an extrapolated APY from the fees accrued in the past 24 hours of 21.93% [1].\n* The CHZ/ETH 1% pool on Uniswap v3 with $364.86k liquidity, and an extrapolated APY from the fees accrued in the past 24 hours of 3.39% [2].\n* The CHZ/ETH pool on Uniswap v2 with $109,356 liquidity, and an extrapolated APY from the fees accrued in the past 24 hours of 7.93% [3].\n* The CHZ 0.2% pool on Bancor with $97,374 liquidity, and an extrapolated APY from the fees accrued in the past 24 hours of 1.19% [4].\n\nThe extra liquidity would bring the total pool liquidity to at least $237k if it is full, with BNT at $2.37.\n\n#### Volume and fee performance\n\nCHZ pool weekly Volume and Fees are presented in Figures 2 and 3, respectively.\n\nhttps://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/bancordao/optimized/2X/0/0a0a32e1ebd1fbf0786f00e22649beaf242e6e81_2_1035x259.jpeg\nFigure 2 - CHZ weekly volume since the end of August.\n\nhttps://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/bancordao/optimized/2X/8/8cd2e5843677a94a780006d872af3af7ba05f1a4_2_1035x258.jpeg\nFigure 3 - CHZ weekly fees since the end of August.\n\nThe pool would benefit from a larger trading liquidity limit to reduce swap price impact, increase volume/fees and thus improve APY.\n\nFOR\n\nIncrease trading liquidity in the CHZ pool from 20k BNT to 50k BNT.\n\nAGAINST\n\nKeep the trading liquidity in the CHZ pool at 20k BNT.\n\n[1] https://info.uniswap.org/#/pools/0xb0f4a77bde7fee134265307c5cc19abff0ba409b\n[2] https://info.uniswap.org/#/pools/0x325365ed8275f6a74cac98917b7f6face8da533b\n[3] https://v2.info.uniswap.org/pair/0xff58711683be66dad6e0e20e0043af46fc7f5f49\n[4] https://etherscan.io/address/0x6680728F13BebA75ae30cC2ea4e0C148aD59Ad32",

Make sure to stake your vBNT for voting before this date and time to participate in the DAO decision.\n\nTo pass, this proposal needs a quorum of 40% and 66.7% FOR votes.\n\n## TL;DR\n\nIncrease ICHI Trading Liquidity to 1M BNT from 700k BNT\n\n## Background\n\nICHI was whitelisted on April 26th, 2021 1 with an overwhelming response of 51% quorum and 97.41% for votes.\nICHI trading liquidity limit was increased to 350k BNT on June 10, 2021 with 54% quorum and 99.85% for votes.\nICHI trading liquidity limit was increased to 700k BNT 1 on August 18, 2021 with 41.48% quorum and 91.2% for votes.\n\nSince the most recent trading liquidity limit increase, ICHI launched Decentralized Monetary Authorities (DMAs) for ShapeShift, DODO, and BOOT. Additionally ICHI released the newest innovation in DeFi 2.0 - Angel Vaults! Since their release, ICHI has already launched its first cohort of Vaults, locking in an additional $10M in TVL in the first month. After the ICHI Angel Vault was released, ICHI’s price increased from ~$5.51 to ~$13.15 through the bear market (Nov. 29th, 2021 - Jan 24th, 2022).\n\nICHI plans to work with the Bancor core-team to partner and build both a DMA and Angel Vault for the Bancor community to help support BNT price and create a stable currency for Bancor operational use.\n\n## Trading Liquidity Limit Increase Justification\n\nICHI liquidity on Bancor is now the largest liquidity pool for the ICHI token but there is only space available for 1,270 more ICHI. With the recent release of ICHI’s Angel Vaults and its price increase, Bancor has been able to continue to grow its TVL through the market downturn. ICHI currently provides a 41.42% APY to this pool via xICHI rewards. An increase in trading liquidity limit to 1M BNT will enable Bancor to strengthen the partnership with ICHI and continue to grow TVL.\n\n## ICHI News Highlights Since Last Proposal\n\n    Are Branded Dollars The New StableCoins? | DeFi 2.0 with ICHI\n    ICHI Releases Angel Vaults: Get Comfy this Crypto Winter\n    ICHI’s Roadmap to 1B in Community Governed Value\n    ICHI enters the lending game with Rari Capital\n    ShapeShift Launches DMA with ICHI\n\nFOR\n\nIncrease ICHI Trading Liquidity to 1M BNT from 700k BNT\n\nAGAINST\n\nKeep ICHI Trading Liquidity at 700k BNT",

If the pool is filled, a new trading liquidity limit increase may be proposed.\n* The pool has space for 215,129 WOO to be staked single-sided and is the second deepest WOO pool on Ethereum.\n\n### Rationale\n\n#### DEX liquidity on Ethereum\n\nThe WOO pools with deepest liquidity in Ethereum DEXes are:\n\n* The WOO/ETH 0.3% pool on Uniswap v2 with $9,372,838 liquidity, and an extrapolated APY from the fees accrued in the past 24 hours of 13.55% [1].\n* The WOO 0.2% pool on Bancor with $7,574,455 liquidity, and an extrapolated APY from the fees accrued in the past 24 hours of 3.38% [2]\n* The WOO/ETH 0.3% pool on Uniswap v3 with $2.04m liquidity, and an extrapolated APY from the fees accrued in the past 24 hours of 3.77% [3].\n* The WOO/USDC 0.3% pool on Uniswap v3 with $642.18k liquidity, and an extrapolated APY from the fees accrued in the past 24 hours of 0.00% [4].\n* The WOO/USDC 0.3% pool on Sushiswap with $589,578.75 liquidity, and an extrapolated APY from the fees accrued in the past 24 hours of 12.06% [5].\n\nThe extra space in the pool would allow for an additional 928,217 WOO (~$600,000) to be staked single-sided, with BNT at $2.40 and WOO at $0.6464.\n\nThe pool has space for 215,129 WOO (~$139,059) to be staked single-sided. If the pool is filled with the proposed trading liquidity limit and already available space, it should hold a total liquidity of at least $9,123,296.\n\nWOO pool weekly Volume and Fees are presented in Figures 1 and 2, respectively.\n\n 1600×519 88.5 KB\n\n1600×514 134 KB\n\nThe pool would benefit from a larger trading liquidity limit to reduce swap price impact, increase volume/fees and thus improve APY.\n\nFOR\n\nIncrease trading liquidity in the WOO pool from 750k BNT to 1M BNT.\n\nAGAINST\n\nKeep the trading liquidity in the WOO pool at 750k BNT.\n\n[1] Uniswap Info\n[2] Bancor: Converter 612 | 0xc51bDa643AFBCf2D5c97678a1AbB825f48BF53d8\n[3] Uniswap Info\n[4] Uniswap Info\n[5] WOO-USDC | SushiSwap Analytics",

Make sure to stake your vBNT for voting before this date and time to participate in the DAO decision.\n\n# TL;DR\n\n* The RSR Team migrated their token contract on the 14th January. A new pool for the new RSR token contract should be created and whitelisted so the liquidity can migrate.\n* Currently the RSR pool has a trading liquidity limit of 750,000. The suggested trading liquidity limit for the new RSR pool is 750,000.\n\n#### OLD Contract Address : 0x8762db106B2c2A0bccB3A80d1Ed41273552616E8\n\n#### NEW Contract Address: 0x320623b8e4ff03373931769a31fc52a4e78b5d70\n\n#### Project Website: https://reserve.org/\n\n\n# **Project Info**\nReserve is a dual-token stablecoin platform that was launched in May 2019 following a successful initial exchange offering (IEO) on the Huobi Prime platform. The projects is backed by investors such as Peter Thiel (PayPal), Sam Altman (YCombinator), Coinbase & Digital Currency Group.\n\nThe Reserve ecosystem will initially consist of two stablecoins, one purely backed by a basket of USD fiatcoins (USDC, TUSD & USDP), and the second backed by DeFi-yield bearing tokens (e.g. cUSDC, aDAI, cBUSD). Both of these will be used by the Reserve app customer base in Latin-America as a means of escaping the hyperinflating local currencies of countries such as Venezuela & Argentina. The Reserve app currently already has 450,000+ customers who pay for their daily expenses (groceries, bills, food delivery, …) at 10,000+ merchants or service providers with our Reserve stablecoins.\n\nUltimately, Reserve aims to create a non-sovereign stablecoin that will be backed by 50+ assets across asset classes & jurisdictions. With the right configuration of assets, this currency could become non-inflatable and more robust than any existing fiat currency. Citizens of countries that experience higher-than-normal inflation rates can then fall back on this global decentralized reserve currency.\n\nReserve Rights (RSR) is the secondary, and volatile, token of the Reserve Protocol. It serves as (a) a backstop in case any of the collateral of Reserve stablecoins defaults and (b) the governance token of Reserve stablecoins.\n\nReserve Rights owner can stake their tokens on Reserve stablecoins, thereby earning a portion of the revenue that stablecoin earns.\n\n# **Token Security**\n\nThe new RSR token does not have an elastic supply, or rebase mechanism. The new contracts are standard ERC-20 OpenZeppelin contracts. The contracts don’t have any permissions that grant administrators unrestricted mint/burn capabilities.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/reserveprotocol/status/1481796233911955456\n\nFOR\nCreate new RSR pool with 750,000 BNT trading liquidity limit.\n\nAGAINST\nDo nothing.\n",

Make sure to stake your vBNT for voting before this date and time to participate in the DAO decision.\n\n### TLDR\n* There isn’t enough evidence to conclude that there is a linear relationship between pool fee and volume, given that many other factors influence volume in the pools.\n* The three stablecoins serve as an interesting experience, as we can set their pool fees to different values and evaluate the impact of the change.\n* An experiment with the stablepool fees was conducted and data from a 24-day period was analysed, suggesting that a 1% fee is ideal.\n* There is value in experimenting with a higher pool fee in one of the pools to understand if an upper limit where the APYs start decreasing can be found.\n* This proposal seeks to change the pool fee for the USDC and USDT pools to 1.0% and DAI to 1.5%.\n\n### Motivation\n\nThis proposal is a continuation of the latest [stablepool fee experiment](https://gov.bancor.network/t/proposal-stablecoin-pools-fee-experiment-and-analysis/3292). Data obtained from the experiment suggests that the revenue was maximised for the USDT pool, which had a 1% pool fee set, with a 170% increase in fees accrued compared to when the USDT pool fee was at 0.2% (Figure 1).\n\nThis proposal seeks to continue this experimentation by changing the pool fee for the USDC pool to 1.0% and DAI to 1.5%. The goal is to maximise profits for USDT and USDC, and experiment with the DAI pool to find an upper limit where we observe a decrease in fees obtained.\n\n![image|690x74](upload://rvhDkZ70OsxbQxG2r2HNdfygNdW.jpeg)\nFigure 1 - Fees accrued in the USDT, USDC and DAI pools during the 12 days before the pool fee change and 12 days after the change.\n\n![image|689x427, 75%](upload://c7N2adjz5T3wYm78cRSoxekDHsS.jpeg)\nFigure 2 - Accumulated volume in the USDT, USDC and DAI pools during the 12 days before the pool fee change and the 12 days after the change.\n\n![image|690x427, 75%](upload://gXiIS5OuWZsWNOji7oX345A2hpZ.jpeg)\nFigure 3 - Accumulated fees in the USDT, USDC and DAI pools during the 12 days before the pool fee change and the 12 days after the change.\n\n![image|690x60](upload://jOIV80amJCLGsI0nWh4gxwADdlA.jpeg)\nFigure 4 - Accumulated volume and average market share for the USDT, USDT and DAI pools during the 12 days before the pool fee change the the 12 days after the change.\n\nIn conclusion, the continuation of this experiment, alongside the results of the TRAC pool one, will hopefully provide enough data to assist in choosing appropriate fees to optimize APYs for the LPs. \n\nFOR\nChange the USDT, USDC and DAI pool fees to 1.0%, 1.0% and 1.5%, respectively.\n\nAGAINST\nKeep the stablepool fees for the USDT, USDC, and DAI pools at 1.0%, 0.5% and 0.2% respectively.",

Make sure to stake your vBNT for voting before this date and time to participate in the DAO decision.\n\n### TL;DR\n\n* The TRAC pool has been part of a pool fee experiment aiming to maximise APYs [1].\n* The pool fee has changed between 0.5% and 4% since November 2021, and volume data doesn’t suggest an obvious linear relationship between the volume and the pool fee.\n* Increasing the pool size would significantly reduce the price impact in the pool, offsetting increases in the pool fee.\n* Increasing the liquidity would therefore allow the pool fee to be increased at no or little extra cost for traders and arbitrageurs. \n* There is a significant interest from the OriginTrail community to stake TRAC on Bancor.\n* This proposal seeks to increase the trading liquidity limit in the TRAC pool from 500k BNT to 1M BNT.\n\n### Rationale\n\n#### DEX liquidity on Ethereum\nThe TRAC pools with deepest liquidity in Ethereum DEXes are:\n\n- The TRAC/ETH 0.3% pool on Uniswap v3 with $417.56k liquidity [2].\n- The TRAC/WETH pool on Uniswap v2 with $357,936 liquidity [3].\n- The TRAC pool on Bancor with $3,191,464 liquidity [4].\n\nThe extra liquidity would bring the total pool liquidity to at least $6.02m if it is full, with BNT at $3.01.\n\n#### Liquidity Share\n\nThe TRAC Liquidity Share on Bancor has been increasing ever since the pool started, currently at 83.4% (Figure 1). This data suggests that there is a significant interest from the OriginTrail community to stake TRAC on Bancor.\n\n![|602x107](upload://kWiDARPtNa5IXe2fNWetCIeAjEb.png)\nFigure 1 - TRAC Liquidity Share [5]\n\n#### Volume and fee performance\n\nTRAC pool weekly Volume and Fees are presented in Figures 2 and 3, respectively.\n\n![Screenshot 2022-01-18 at 17.49.13|690x171](upload://hCMrjDU40AOMzx01AoporJMdapq.jpeg)\nFigure 2 - TRAC weekly volume since the end of August.\n\n![Screenshot 2022-01-18 at 17.48.31|690x172](upload://bLfDms67cG12pfg9xZFnCuCbHFf.jpeg)\nFigure 3 - TRAC weekly fees since the end of August.\n\nFOR\n\nIncrease trading liquidity in the TRAC pool from 500k BNT to 1M BNT.\n\nAGAINST\n\nKeep the trading liquidity in the TRAC pool at 500k BNT.\n\n[1] https://gov.bancor.network/t/proposal-trac-bnt-fee-change-schedule-and-performance-analysis/3239\n\n[2] https://info.uniswap.org/#/pools/0xb1914469141ebb6e244e75cee3f35d43bf6b85e5\n\n[3] https://v2.info.uniswap.org/pair/0x1a58aa618df8f1ec282748fef6185c1a1cc2faa6\n\n[4] https://etherscan.io/address/0x987Caf390Fc5100dA6db7e8Ec4b651Cd3b61bc32\n\n[5] https://dune.xyz/queries/356955/679423",

      "content": "For this proposal to pass, it requires a 35% quorum and 66.7% supermajority.\n\nThis proposal is expected to appear on Snapshot for voting on Sunday 23rd January 2022\n\n# TL;DR\n\n* Proposal to whitelist PHTR (Phuture token)\n* Phuture is a decentralised asset management protocol focused on delivering quality index products to retail and institutions\n* The proposed initial trading liquidity limit is 100k BNT\n* There are no apparent security concerns that would prohibit whitelist status\n* Whitelist approval will set us up to bring our liquidity mining programme to Bancor v3\n* PHTR is listed on gate.io, coingecko, coinmarketcap and verified on etherscan.\n\n# Justification\n\n**Overview**\n\nPhuture is a decentralised asset management protocol allowing for the creation and investment of index products.\n\n* Earlier this year we raised $2.75mm in seed funding to enable us to launch our protocol and interface to the market.\n* We are in the final stages of development and our product launch is targeted for Q1 2022.\n* The protocol automatically rebalances and updates portfolios of assets to track a specific strategy set by the index manager.\n* Our end goal is to build index products that are easily accessible by the masses and help bring over the next wave of people into crypto.\n\n**Current Liquidity**\n\nThe PHTR token currently has two main pools on Sushiswap, which are USDC/PHTR and ETH/PHTR which collectively have circa $700k in liquidity. We are proposing that we whitelist the PHTR token with a trading liquidity limit of 100k BNT which would enable the Bancor pool to become the largest and most liquid pool, attracting the lion's share of the trade volume due to improved execution. We are confident that opening up one sided staking for PHTR token holders would attract a meaningful share of liquidity from our current ePHTR staking programme. This programme has around 2mm PHTR tokens staked. Thus we expect to use up the 100k BNT limit reasonably quickly.\n\nWe are currently running a liquidity mining programme for our USDC/PHTR pool on Sushiswap. Another reason for our proposal is to allow us to execute our liquidity mining programme directly on Bancor v3 by dropping PHTR rewards to participants of this pool. This would effectively act as an additional incentive to bring liquidity from the sushiswap pools over to Bancor. We expect that this would allow us to surpass $1mm of liquidity in our Bancor pool.\n\nAdditionally, our ePHTR staking programme would be the perfect destination for excess tokens in our Bancor v3 pool that are not matched with any BNT, allowing for further yield optimisation.\n\nThe ETH/PHTR pool is currently incentivised via Harvest Finance and there are no immediate plans to change this.\n\n**The PHTR token**\n\nPHTR is the governance token of the Phuture protocol and it allows its holder to participate in governance and share in the protocol’s growth both via dividends and capital appreciation. As the protocol evolves more use cases for PHTR will come to fruition and its pervasiveness within the platform will rise.\n\n* 100mm initial max supply\n* Minter role is governed by the DAO multi-sig. The minter role only exists to continue incentivising and growing the Phuture ecosystem, should the initial 100mm max supply fail to get us to self-sustainability.\n* Minting is restricted\n* Pauser role has been deactivated\n* Non upgradeable contract\n* Contract uses standard OZ contracts\n* No rebasing or elastic supply\n\nToken metrics and statistics can be found on our Dune analytics page: https://dune.xyz/OliverMehr/Phuture-Official-Dashboard\n\n[CMC](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/phuture/) \n[CG](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/phuture)\n[Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/token/0xe1fc4455f62a6e89476f1072530c20cf1a0622da)\n\n# Summary\n\nIn summary, we see the whitelisting of PHTR as the start of a long working relationship with Bancor, which can not only grow as Bancor 3 is launched but also allows us to explore other areas of collaboration with our index products in the future.\n\nFOR - Approve Whitelist + Trading Liquidity + IL protection\n\nAGAINST - Do Nothing",

      "title": "Proposal Addendum: Incentivize users to migrate to V3 by matching token side LM rewards with up to 50,000 BNT per pool",
      "content": "### This proposal is expected to appear on Snapshot for voting on [date=2022-01-23 timezone=\"Europe/Lisbon\"]. Make sure to stake your vBNT for voting before this date and time to participate in the DAO decision.\n\nTL;DR\n\n* This proposal is an addendum to the original proposal for the dual LM rewards program, at https://gov.bancor.network/t/proposal-incentivize-users-to-migrate-to-v3-by-matching-token-side-lm-rewards-with-up-to-50-000-bnt-per-pool/3318.\n* The community has expressed their wishes in the governance post of extending the dual LM rewards program cut-off date from end of March 2022 to end of April 2022.\n* In Bancor 3, external token projects can incentivise their own communities by providing liquidity incentives in their own TKN.\n* To garner fast adoption, bring awareness to the External Liquidity Mining rewards tool, and lubricate the transition from Bancor v2.1 to Bancor 3, this proposal seeks to match external team’s liquidity mining incentives in dollar value at the time of token commitment, up to a maximum of 50,000 BNT, emitted over a 24 months schedule.\n* The matched BNT will be emitted over a 24 months schedule. The 2-year duration is chosen with a long term view in mind.\n\n### External Liquidity Mining feature\n\nExternal Liquidity Mining will be a new feature available on Bancor 3’s Phase 0 release. Blog post about v3 at [https://blog.bancor.network/introducing-bancor-3-962a3c601c25 ](https://blog.bancor.network/introducing-bancor-3-962a3c601c25) and Mark’s presentation on V3: [Bancor 3: Dawn Phase 1 Keynote @ DCentral Miami - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi1geks1n8A).\n\nLiquidity Mining is a convenient tool to bootstrap liquidity with proven results. Figure 1 and 2 show the pool balance increasing significantly after LM rewards were activated, and finally stabilising at a higher TVL than before the program started. Figure 3 shows the Liquidity Share for the FARM pool increasing once LM rewards were activated, and stabilising at higher values.\n\n![|624x164](upload://qu62EcIldBqOHAPpK8CFl7Kbest.png)\n\nFigure 1 - WOO pool balance over time. LM rewards started at the end of May 2021.\n\n![|624x167](upload://xFo0nZGzgMTjffgnbcszTkgtkRn.png)\n\nFigure 2 - FARM pool balance over time. LM rewards started at the end of July.\n\n![|624x149](upload://c51flyoH9tMS2cITq1w0qnNThXx.png)\n\nFigure 3 - FARM Liquidity Share on Ethereum.\n\nMatching the rewards on TKN with BNT rewards means that less BNT is needed for Liquidity Mining compared to v2.1.\n\nSince the announcement of Bancor V3, there has been strong interest among white listed tokens to offer LM rewards. Migration to V3 can be achieved in a single click via the Bancor app. The liquidity incentives discussed here are an important component in stimulating users to migrate from v2.1 to Bancor3.\n\nTo accelerate the adoption, and help raise awareness for this feature, each white listed token that commits to their own auto-compounding rewards program, the BancorDAO will match the emissions value up to a maximum of 50,000 BNT.\n\nThere is no requirement that the token and BNT LM be on the same emission schedule; however, the BNT emissions will be non-negotiable and fixed over a 24-month period.\n\nTo receive the BNT rewards, LPs need to stake their LP tokens in a rewards contract. Decision on the rewards emission schedule is purposely open-ended and will be proposed and decided at a later stage by the BancorDAO.\n\nIn conclusion, the Dual LM rewards program seeks to:\n\n* Incentivise LPs to migrate from Bancor v2.1 to Bancor3.\n* Increase awareness of the External Liquidity Mining feature.\n* Attract more LPs from different communities to stake on Bancor and get familiarised with Bancor3 features.\n* The BNT emission schedule has a long-term view in mind.\n\nFOR\n\nAccept the addendum to move the cut-off date from the end of March 2022 to the end of April 2022.\n\nAGAINST\n\nContinue with the previous dual LM rewards proposal with a cut-off date at the end of March 2022.",

      "content": "## TLDR\n\nThis proposal seeks to increase the Bancor3 fee for INDEX trades from 0.2% to 0.5%. The v2.1 pool fee will remain unchanged at 0.2%.\n\n## Abstract\n\nSince its launch in October, the Bancor pool for INDEX has struggled to capture AUM, and remains the smallest available pool on L1.\n\n||AUM ($)|24 H vol (13jan21)|Trade size to have 0.5% price impact|\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|Sushiswap (0.3%)|$351,000|$25,000|$888|\n|Uniswap v2 (0.3%)|$323,000|$30,000|$817|\n|Uniswap v3 (1.0%)|$139,000|$46,000|$355|\n|Balancer v1 (70:30, 2%)|$684,000|$14,000|$1,430|\n|Bancor (0.2%)|$133,000|$2,400|$336|\n|||||\n\nAs such, the pool mainly receives arbitrage/aggregator trades when $INDEX price volatility is high (i.e. the pool is mispriced vs the market).\n\nEven so, the pool has managed to return the equivalent to ~1.8% APY annualised for INDEX and BNT deposits.\n\nAs Bancor research (reported in the community call on the 11th of January) found that increasing the pool fees did not have a clear effect (positive or negative) on the pool volume. Therefore there is scope for [reasonable] increases in pool fees to generate more income for INDEX deposits (and Bancor Protocol $BNT).\n\nNote, the INDEX holders have voted to deploy protocol owned INDEX and ETH to uniswap v3 in order to increase DEX liquidity. This is expected to dampen $INDEX price volatility and will have the effect of driving less arbitrage volume to the bancor pool and so reduce the volume in the pool.\n\n## Motivation\n\nBy increasing the fees to 0.5% we should increase income for the bancor protocol BNT and LP INDEX deposited in the pool. The increase due to the fee income is expected to be greater than the reduced volume due to the higher fee.\n\nMaking the fee change take effect on the v3 pool only is intended to have a number of effects:\n\n1. Encourage v2.1 LP’s to migrate to Bancor3 \n2. Encourage prospective LP’s to wait for Bancor3 before depositing INDEX and so save gas compared to depositing in v2.1 and then migrating to Bancor3.\n3. Help build the marketing message around increased income for single-sided staking with IL protection.\n\n**For**\n\nIncrease the fee in the INDEX trades from 0.2% to 0.5% for the Bancor3 trades only\n\n**Against**\n\nLaunch Bancor3 with the INDEX trade fee at 0.2% unchanged vs v2.1.\n\n\n------------------\n**Links**\n\n[Sushiswap analytics](https://analytics.sushi.com/pairs/0xa73df646512c82550c2b3c0324c4eedee53b400c) \n\n[Uniswap v2 analytics](https://v2.info.uniswap.org/pair/0x3452a7f30a712e415a0674c0341d44ee9d9786f9) \n\n[Uniswap v3 analytics](https://info.uniswap.org/#/pools/0x8c13148228765ba9e84eaf940b0416a5e349a5e7) \n\n[Balancer pool](https://pools.balancer.exchange/#/pool/0xcf19a7c81fcf0e01c927f28a2b551405e58c77e5/shares)\n\n\n[Bancor converter 697](https://etherscan.io/address/0x0a3df697e872ab920f305db00450c0a372e6c970)\n\n\n[gov.INDEXcoop.com IIP 109](https://gov.indexcoop.com/t/proposed-iip-109-deploy-protocol-owned-index-eth-liquidity-into-managed-visor-vault-on-uniswap-v3/3238)",

      "content": "**TLDR**\n\n* This proposal seeks to increase the trading capacity limit to **300K $BNT** for the **$DDX** pool (from the current **100K $BNT**).\n* It also seeks to increase the pool fees from **.2%** to **1%** since the pool has attracted the most liquidity\n* It will open up space for LPs on the TKN side (**$DDX**) and increase the depth of the pool as LPs add liquidity\n* A larger **$DDX** pool will attract more trades from aggregators and professional market makers to Bancor which ultimately leads to more fees for our platform.\n\n**For**\n\n1. A larger trading capacity limit on the pool will let LPs provide single-sided liquidity and will lead to an increase in pool depth\n2. A higher fee on this pool is warranted since it has the largest depth and will bring more fee revenue to LPs\n2. More liquidity in the **DDX-BNT** pool should lead to larger volume from DEX aggregators and professional market makers sent in our direction\n3. More volume for Bancor leads to more fees for our platform and **$BNT** holders\n\n**Against**\n\n1. We should not increase the trading capacity limit on the pool or raise its fees\n\n**Abstract**\n\nThe initial whitelisting for DDX is here:\n\nhttps://gov.bancor.network/t/proposal-onboard-derivadao-token-ddx-plus-100k-bnt-trading-liquidity/3244\n\nThere are currently **~92K $BNT** and **~81K $DDX** tokens in the BNT-DDX [pool](https://etherscan.io/address/0xaa869d9c3bee6a732819986a7193ea16e02bd1fe). This has resulted in a pool that has roughly **~600K** in liquidity. This proposal seeks to increase the **$DDX** pool's single-sided capacity by increasing the trading liquidity limit to **300K $BNT**.\n\n![image|478x307](upload://ojhtbE9tQo6rHL5YAiJ7fLMZBJf.png)\n\n**Motivation**\n\nIf we want to attract more DDX LPs to Bancor, we need to open up space in the pool so that they can provide single-sided liquidity. This would allow us to grow the liquidity in the pool and attract larger trades towards our platform which ultimately results in higher fees for Bancor. \n\nThere are currently two pools for the DDX token on Uniswap V2 and Sushiswap respectively.\n\n![image|390x500](upload://mfjR3Rn8NpIU0glMaV2wZuhispa.png)\n\n![image|690x239](upload://jqsmjqiHtcQoMENvHWJ6OirTNrE.png)\n\nWe have the majority of liquidity on Bancor due to a single DDX whale that filled up the entire pool when the token was whitelisted:\n\n![image|690x275](upload://kf7zt6a8eKVdyUrTm0ZXV7JrVNH.png)\n\nthe DDX community was very enthusiastic about onboarding DDX to Bancor but no one got a chance to stake any of their DDX tokens. There is plenty of interest that has been shown from DDX holders that would like to LP on Bancor (some are new that aren't familiar with Bancor) and I think it is a great way to onboard a new community and potentially acquire new LPs for other tokens.\n\nThe fee increase is being requested because we have the most liquidity from DEXes and also because if we were to fill this up (I have high confidence that we will) then the liquidity on Bancor will rival that of coinbase (going by their orderbook). I expect some of that trading to potentially make its way to Bancor if that happens (you can find complaints on Twitter about $DDX liquidity) and also volume to pick up as the DerivaDEX platform launches in mainnet soon ([latest update](https://medium.com/derivadex/cambrian-testnet-update-2a2cb1148195)).\n\nCurrently, the Bancor pool has no space available and LPs can’t provide single-sided liquidity on the TKN side ($DDX). I am proposing a **300K** trading liquidity limit for the $DDX pool.",

To a wide variety of users, the difference between a 0.2% and a 0.5% swap fee is essentially zero.

The 1000 and 2000 x axis values represent a 0.1% and 0.2% fee, respectively.\n\nMark’s comment on the TRAC pool fee experiment sheds some light into the topic.\n\n[quote]\nIt’s not a bad idea. Analysis of fee changes the DAO has made up to the present suggest we are still in the noise - in general, fee changes make zero difference to trade volumes, and understandably so. To a wide variety of users, the difference between a 0.2% and a 0.5% swap fee is essentially zero. More importantly, lower fees to drive higher volume is not commensurate with increased returns; Uniswap v3 has attained some truly remarkable volumes, but is currently running at a $20M loss. This i…\n[/quote]\n\nIn conclusion, increasing the pool fee will help siphon more profits from arbitrageur to the protocol, most likely not affect volume and therefore increase APYs for the LPs in the pool and protocol-earned fees.\n\nFor\n\n1. Increase the pool fee in the OCEAN pool from 0.2% to 0.5%.\n\nAgainst\n\n1.

The response from the Bancor platform, DAO, and community has been positive regarding the inclusion of SFI as a whitelisted asset. If a buy-back of SFI tokens is authorized by Saffron governance then it should be executed on-chain where the most organic liquidity is found.\n\n* TVL. As noted above, we would like to prioritize Bancor for executing the buy-back, and TVL is important to incur the smallest price impact as possible. In exchange for prioritizing the Bancor AMM for any purchases of SFI on-chain, the Bancor network will issue 2500 BNT per week in LM rewards for the SFI/BNT pair.\n\nInitial Stages of Development\n\nThis proposal is an initial introduction to the idea of having an ongoing partnership between the Saffron and Bancor governance communities and is the first major step towards putting the Saffron treasury to work on Bancor. Due to the successful governance proposal in the past we expect our future collaboration to have similar positive outcomes for SFI and BNT holders.\n\nDisclaimer: The decisions made in this proposal are subject to change in future governance votes. However, until another governance vote is made to cancel these actions, the outcome of this proposal is binding and will be followed out as strictly as possible given current market conditions.\n\nVote FOR: Start LM on SFI/BNT pool at the amounts listed above in exchange for prioritizing the Bancor pool for future SFI buy-backs\n\nVote AGAINST: Make no change",

The contracts don’t have any permissions that grant administrators unrestricted mint/burn capabilities.\n\nThe max supply for SHEESHA on Polygon is 1,000,000,000.\n\nThe top 15 contracts and addresses with the highest concentration of SHEESHA are the Uniswap v2 pool contract, Sheesha Vault contracts, token contract, and team wallets for allocation.\n\n**![|602x388](upload://kyPvSxMqKMBKGvKkKbdIR5gH3sH.jpeg)**\n\nFigure 1 - Top 15 contract and address with the highest concentration of SHEESHA [4]\n\n# Project\n\nSheesha Finance is an ambitious, one-of-a-kind, fiery DeFi multi-chain platform offering a level playing field for all investors to access a diversified portfolio of projects.\n\nFounded and supported by established investment leaders in the blockchain space, Sheesha Finance’s exceptional team has experience in over 50 token launches.\n\n‍\n\nEmerging from the multicultural and dynamic city of Dubai, Sheesha Finance is gearing up to erupt with the world’s best selection of DeFi flavours.\n\nWe all know that holding one type of crypto is never enough. When you are introduced to the multifaceted potential of crypto, who doesn’t become hungry to collect as many crypto flavours as you can?\n\nWith DeFi’s rapid growth showing no sign of slowing, attention and investment in the space increase every day. Sheesha Finance is well-positioned as the DeFi project underpinning an interconnected and thriving ecosystem.\n\n‍\n\nBecoming official partners with Sheesha Finance opens your project to top tier VC access, project incubation and ecosystem support, diverse token holders and project stability throughout your acceleration phase.\n\nLitepaper can be found [here](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6113e8db047f8269e5c69bf4/61605dc5f64e361b52ee71f0_Sheesha%20Finance%20Litepaper%20Updated-min.pdf).\n\n# Tokenomics\n\nThere are three Sheesha Finance chains, ERC20, BEP20 and MATIC.\n\nThe Ethereum/BSC SHEESHA supply was created with 100,000 tokens. 15,000 tokens on each chain were “burnt” during a smart contract migration event on both chains.\n\nWhilst the fully diluted supply is 100,000 on both chains, only 85,000 of these tokens will be accessible to the team and community.\n\nThe Polygon mSHEESHA supply was created with 1,000,000,000 tokens.\n\nDuring the LGEs, 15,000 tokens on the Ethereum/BSC chain were made available for liquidity and are staked as LP on Uniswap and Pancakeswap for 24 months from April 2021 with fees to unstake beginning at 96% and decreasing by 4% every month.\n\nSheesha Finance native token rewards are distributed every network block..\n\nVia the staking contracts each chain has available for 24 months from April 2021: - 10,000 SHEESHA token rewards for wallets staking single-sided SHEESHA tokens - 20,000 SHEESHA token rewards for wallets staking SHEESHA-LP tokens (tokens created by combining SHEESHA and ETH/BNB to an equal value on a DEX and then staked on the Sheesha platform.)\n\nAfter the end of the 24-month period from the LGE, staking rewards will continue via redistribution of unstaking fees in order to reward and incentivise the staking community.\n\nAt Sheesha Finance, we know how important it is to advocate decentralized finance and build an engaged community. So we have allocated 10,000 tokens on Ethereum/BSC and 10% of the SHEESHA Supply on Polygon for marketing. A further 10,000 tokens on Ethereum/BSC and 10% of the SHEESHA supply on Polygon are for team, legal costs, advisors, and ongoing development.\n\nThe token reserve of 20,000 tokens on Ethereum/BSC and 10% of the SHEESHA supply on Polygon is for token swaps with partner projects as we fund the revolution in DeFi.\n\nMore information on Sheesha Finance can be found on [Gitbook](https://sheeshafinance.gitbook.io/sheesha-finance/).\n\n![image|602x339](upload://9SRMc8ePum5OzXzTYmSVDs11PnP.jpeg)\n\nFigure 2 - SHEESHA token distribution.\n\n# Community and Communication\n\nSheesha Finance community is active on [Telegram](https://t.me/sheesha_finance).

Make sure to stake your vBNT for voting before this date and time to participate in the DAO decision.\n\nTL;DR\n\n* External token projects can incentivise their own communities by providing liquidity incentives in their own TKN.\n* To garner fast adoption, and lubricate the transition from Bancor v2.1 to Bancor 3, we propose to match external team’s incentives up to a maximum of 50,000 BNT, emitted over a 24 months schedule.\n\nIncentives for TKN teams to use the Auto-Compounding rewards mechanism on Bancor3.\n\nExternal Liquidity Mining will be a new feature available on Bancor 3’s Phase 0 release. Blog post about v3 at https://blog.bancor.network/introducing-bancor-3-962a3c601c25 and Mark’s presentation on V3: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi1geks1n8A.\n\nLiquidity Mining is a convenient tool to bootstrap liquidity with proven results. Figure 1 and 2 show the pool balance increasing significantly after LM rewards were activated, and finally stabilising at a higher TVL than before the program started. Matching the rewards on TKN with BNT rewards means that less BNT is needed for Liquidity Mining compared to v2.1.\n\nSince the announcement of Bancor V3, there has been strong interest among white listed tokens to offer LM rewards. Migration to V3 can be achieved in a single click via the Bancor app. The liquidity incentives discussed here are an important component in stimulating users to migrate from v2.1 to Bancor3.\n\nTo accelerate the adoption, and help raise awareness for this feature, each white listed token that commits to their own auto-compounding rewards program, the BancorDAO will match the emissions value up to a maximum of 50,000 BNT.\n\nThere is no requirement that the token and BNT LM be on the same emission schedule; however, the BNT emissions will be non-negotiable and fixed over a 24-month period.\n\n![|624x164](upload://fQXyPqDMLcbfLZd5Z4HhFoce6pG.png)\nFigure 1 - WOO pool balance over time.

      "content": "**TLDR**\n\n* This proposal seeks to increase the trading liquidity to **1M $BNT** for the **$CEL** pool from **250K $BNT**.\n* It will open up space for LPs on the TKN side ( **$CEL** ) and increase the depth of the pool as LPs add liquidity\n* A larger **$CEL** pool will attract more trades from aggregators and professional market makers to Bancor which ultimately leads to more fees for our platform.\n\n**For**\n\n1. An increase in $BNT trading liquidity will let LPs stake single-sided and lead to an increase in pool depth\n2. More liquidity in the **CEL-BNT** pool should lead to larger volume from DEX aggregators and professional market makers sent in our direction\n3. More volume for Bancor leads to more fees for our platform and **$BNT** holders\n\n**Against**\n\n1. We should not increase the trading liquidity limit on the pool or lower its fees\n\n**Abstract**\nThere are currently **~294K $BNT** and **~254K $CEL** tokens in the BNT-CEL [pool](https://etherscan.io/address/0x954F1943Af6f46971ee4C81E73f9103359F7D25d). This has resulted in a pool that has roughly **~2M** in liquidity. This proposal seeks to increase the **$CEL** pool’s single-sided capacity by increasing the trading liquidity to **1M $BNT** from the current **250K $BNT**.\n\n\n**Motivation**\n\nIf we want to attract more CEL LPs to Bancor, we need to open up space in the pool so that they can provide single-sided liquidity. This would allow us to grow the liquidity in the pool and attract larger trades towards our platform which ultimately results in higher fees for Bancor.\n\nThe top pool for CEL is on Uniswap V3 and it is paired with ETH. Pool depth is roughly **6.36M** and we should try to be as deep as this pool if not deeper.\n\n\nThere is also a decent size pool on Uniswap V2 with 1.6M in liquidity.\n\n\nCurrently, the Bancor pool has no space available and LPs can’t provide single-sided liquidity on the TKN side ($CEL). I am proposing a **1M** trading liquidity increase for the $CEL pool.",

Make sure to stake your vBNT for voting before this date and time to participate in the DAO decision.\n\n# TL;DR\n\n* Proposal to whitelist CTSI.\n\n* Trading Liquidity Limit of 50,000 BNT.\n\n* There are no security concerns that could prohibit whitelist status.\n\n* There is no reason to doubt the legitimacy of the Cartesi Project. The project was founded in 2018 and the team is [public](https://cartesi.io/en/about/).\n\n* The benefit to Bancor is clear. Providing CTSI liquidity will attract token LPs from Cartesi to swap on Bancor, and increase protocol trade volume.\n\n### Token Address: [0x491604c0fdf08347dd1fa4ee062a822a5dd06b5d](https://etherscan.io/address/0x491604c0fdf08347dd1fa4ee062a822a5dd06b5d)\n\n### Project Website: [Cartesi](https://cartesi.io/)\n\n# Liquidity\n\nThe Deepest CTSI pools are:\n\nThe CTSI/ETH 1% Uniswap v3 pool with $827,681.09 liquidity [1].\n\nThe CTSI/USDT 0.3% Uniswap v3 pool with $291,747.60 liquidity [2].\n\nA trading liquidity limit of 50,000 BNT opens up space for at least $346k liquidity in the pool, with BNT at $3.46. If the pool fills up, a trading liquidity limit increase will be proposed.\n\n# Token Security\n\nCTSI does not have an elastic supply, or rebase mechanism. The CTSI token has a max supply cap of 1,000,000,000 CTSI. Contracts are standard ERC-20 OpenZeppelin contracts. The contracts don’t have any permissions that grant administrators unrestricted mint/burn capabilities.\n\nThe top 15 contracts and addresses with the highest concentration of CTSI are Locking and Staking contracts, CTSI token timelock contracts, token distribution and team wallets, and Binance.\n\n![|602x377](upload://yBtC6GHMmgU7XnTenx0YOfNJsOX.jpeg)\n\nFigure 1 - Top 15 contract and address with the highest concentration of CTSI [3]\n\n# Project\n\nCartesi is the first OS on the blockchain, and their Layer-2 solution integrates Linux and standard programming environments to blockchain. This allows developers to code scalable smart contracts with rich software tools, libraries, and services they are used to.\n\nCartesi bridges the gap between mainstream software and blockchain, welcoming millions of new startups and their developers to blockchain by bringing Linux to blockchain applications. Cartesi combines a groundbreaking virtual machine, optimistic roll-ups, and side-chains to revolutionize the way developers create blockchain applications.\n\nWhat gives Cartesi a competitive edge as a layer-2 and optimistic rollups solution is that it allows developers to code their smart contracts and DApps directly with mainstream software components and Linux OS resources. That represents more than an incremental improvement to decentralized applications. It is a necessary step toward the maturity of the whole blockchain ecosystem. Allowing mainstream programmability means that DApp developers have an entirely new expressive power to create from simple to rather complex smart contracts. It also means opening the doors for extensive adoption of regular developers who have never programmed for blockchain, as they will create decentralized applications with a coding experience similar to desktop or web.\n\n### Key Highlights\n\n* Cartesi is a layer-2 infrastructure for blockchains that allows developers to code highly scalable smart contracts with mainstream software stacks on a Linux VM. Cartesi uses a combination of rollups and side-chains.\n\n* Mainstream programmability: Developers create smart contracts with mainstream software stacks, taking a productive leap from the limited programmability of blockchain-specific VM's to coding with software components supported by Linux.\n\n* Large scalability: Cartesi enables million-fold computational scalability, data availability of large files and low transaction costs. All while preserving the strong security guarantees of the underlying blockchain.\n\n* Privacy guarantees: Cartesi allows for decentralized games where players conceal their data and Enterprise applications that run on sensitive data, preserving privacy on DApps.\n\n* Portability: Cartesi is blockchain-agnostic and will run on top of the most important chains. The [current implementations](https://cartesi.io/en/docs/descartes/supported-networks/) already support Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, Matic (Polygon), with Elrond coming soon.\n\nMore information can be found on the official [website](https://cartesi.io/), on the [Whitepaper](https://cartesi.io/cartesi_whitepaper.pdf) and on the [CTSI Macroeconomy paper](https://cartesi.io/CTSI_Macroeconomy.pdf).\n\n# Tokenomics\n\nCTSI is a utility token that works as a crypto-fuel for Noether.\n\n* Stakers receive CTSI rewards by staking their tokens and participating in the network.\n\n* Node runners are selected randomly according to a PoS system and gain the right to create the next block.\n\n* Users of the network pay CTSI fees to insert data on the side-chain.\n\nCTSI also plays a role with Descartes Rollups.\n\n* CTSI will be used by DApps to outsource the execution of verifiable and enforceable computation to entities running Descartes nodes.\n\n* Full details can be read on the [Cartesi Network and CTSI article](https://medium.com/cartesi/cartesi-network-and-ctsi-b9a5e206fedf).\n\n# Community and Communication\n\nCartesi is active on [Telegram](https://t.me/cartesiproject) and [Discord](https://discordapp.com/invite/Pt2NrnS).

Opening space in the pool will allow for these funds to be deposited on Bancor.\n* The KeeperDAO community has already passed a [proposal](https://snapshot.org/#/rook.eth/proposal/0x621d2c8a2abf634559a6b7b360dd131c6796fe5a00aad06a14c20e19cabcbf11)(with zero objections) to stake these funds in Bancor but the space that we had previously opened was front ran. This proposal is seeking to make additional space for the $ROOK treasury.\n* A larger ROOK-BNT pool will reduce price impact and therefore attract more trades from retail users, aggregators, and professional market makers to Bancor.\n\n# Abstract\nThere is currently **~1.6M BNT** and **~35K ROOK** tokens in the BNT-ROOK [pool](https://etherscan.io/address/0xFa7b9AD60304119f59B172Ef78B98D50cb9A5c98). This has resulted in a pool that has roughly **~10.2M** in liquidity. At the moment, we won't be able to support the ROOK treasury and they won't be able to provide single-sided liquidity since there is not enough capacity. This proposal is seeking to increase single-sided capacity in the ROOK pool by increasing the trading liquidity to **2.5M BNT**.\n\n![image|484x300](upload://tQ2odIWwxyFTxX0syZMNoYzy85Q.png)\n\n# For\nIncrease pool co-investment from **2.1M BNT** to **2.5M BNT**.\n\n# Against\nKeep the pool co-investment at 2.1M BNT.\n\n[1] https://forum.keeperdao.com/t/kip-11-co-invest-rook-in-bancor-rook-bnt-pool/176/1\n[2] https://snapshot.org/#/rook.eth/proposal/0x621d2c8a2abf634559a6b7b360dd131c6796fe5a00aad06a14c20e19cabcbf11",

Our core mission is the acceleration of R&D in the extension of human life and health-span. Today, the biopharma industry booms with unprecedented late-stage investment, particularly in longevity science. However, the industry severely lacks critical early-stage funding. Moreover, incentives between patients, researchers and industry are misaligned, risking monopolization of lifespan extension.\n\nAt its core, biopharma value creation consists of intellectual property (IP) rights, domain-specific know-how, and research data. Today, R&D has become prohibitively expensive and siloed, largely due to the way IP business models incentivize the monopolization of innovation. This is done through the creation of patent thickets in protected portfolios. These IP mechanisms prevent open sharing of research data, inherently disincentivizing collaboration and transparency. They prevent the public and patients from having any real ownership in biopharma IP, despite their tax dollars funding most early-stage development. Outside of grants to fund basic research, early-stage funding for drug development is extremely limited. When drugs do finally make it to market, there exist strong incentives for price gouging.\n\nTo align incentives and vitalize early-stage funding in longevity biopharma, VitaDAO uses a combination of novel governance frameworks in decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and financial engineering tools such as algorithmic automated market makers (AMMs), all of which run on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nAs an open global cooperative that anyone can join, VitaDAO’s goal is to support and finance new therapeutics and research data in longevity science. In exchange, VitaDAO will directly hold IP and data rights in the novel early-stage therapeutics it supports and funds. We will grow a portfolio of IP and data assets, which we can make available and monetize either through novel data marketplaces or by conventional licensing and commercialisation processes in biopharma. By utilising community-guided decision-making processes, VitaDAO aims to:\n\n1. rapidly decrease funding decision lifecycles\n\n2. attract the worlds leading researchers by promoting open science principles\n\n3. democratize ownership thereof\n\nMore information can be found [here](https://www.vitadao.com/about) and on the [whitepaper](https://github.com/VitaDAO/whitepaper/raw/master/VitaDAO_Whitepaper.pdf)\n\n# Tokenomics\n\nThe lifeblood of VitaDAO is its native curation and governance token: VITA. Individuals or organizations can obtain VITA tokens by contributing work, funds, or other resources like data and IP.

      "content": "### This proposal is expected to appear on Snapshot for voting on [date=2022-01-02 timezone=\"Europe/Lisbon\"]. Make sure to stake your vBNT for voting before this date and time to participate in the DAO decision.\n\n### TLDR\n* This proposal seeks to set the USDT/BNT, USDC/BNT and DAI/BNT pool fees to 1%, 0.5%, and 0.2%, respectively, from 0.2%.\n* There isn’t enough evidence to conclude that there is a linear relationship between pool fee and volume, given that many other factors influence volume in the pools.\n* The three stablecoins serve as an interesting experience, as we can set their pool fees to different values and evaluate the impact of the change.\n* The goal is to ultimately increase APYs for these pools.\n\n### Abstract\n\nWeekly volume and fees from the USDC, DAI and USDT pools from the week of the 30th of August have been consistent (Figure 1 and 2).\n\n![|624x161](upload://oQRV53PBpJX4XdjY0QIcMNbLWgN.png)\nFigure 1 - Weekly Fees for DAI, USDC and USDT pools.\n\n![|624x160](upload://3B6TObrXycdTOz9P7yqohUVDSoC.png)\nFigure 2 - Weekly volume for DAI, USDC and USDT pools.\n\nTotal volume on Bancor for intervals ending in November 2021 can be found in Figure 3.\n\n![|375x384](upload://aPichJNYrPmfEBAo4CioC2arKo7.jpeg)\nFigure 3 - Total Volume on Bancor for intervals this year\n\nAnd since there were fee changes for all the stablepools to 0.2% in February 2021, we can look at the Bancor Volume at the 7, 14, 21 day intervals either side of the change (Figure 4).\n\n![|554x291](upload://a5QkNFf42drFanP2zHkdcb4auby.jpeg)\nFigure 4 - Volume on Bancor either side of Fee Change.\n\n### Motivation\n\nAn analysis on the effect of the pool fees on pool volume conducted on the USDC/BNT, USDT/BNT, and DAI/BNT pools showed that there is not enough evidence to support a linear relationship between them (Figure 5, Figure 6, and Figure 7).\n\nFor the DAI pool (Figure 7) there is a minor (not statistical) decrease in market share upon changing the fee 0.1% -> 0.2% as measured at the 7, 14, 21, and 30 day intervals. While the overall market share has significantly increased (300 days either side).\n\n![|576x288](upload://AndGCets4YjFm52mAFki89CGn2M.jpeg)\nFigure 5 - USDC pool fee changes with market share before and after the Fee change. The 1000, 2000 and 3000 x axis values represent a 0.1%, 0.2% and 0.3% fee, respectively.\n\n![|576x288](upload://qCCbUh18lqMCxQqthhjm9rJsSYs.jpeg)\nFigure 6 - USDT pool fee changes with market share before and after the Fee change. The 1000 and 2000 x axis values represent a 0.1% and 0.2% fee, respectively.\n\n![|576x288](upload://lh0l0cXhca91j7GVRvW9opypLIO.jpeg)\nFigure 7 - DAI pool fee changes with market share before and after the Fee change. The 1000 and 2000 x axis values represent 0.1% and 0.2%, respectively.\n\nMark’s comment on the TRAC pool fee experiment sheds some light into the pool fee topic.\n\nhttps://gov.bancor.network/t/proposal-trac-bnt-fee-change-schedule-and-performance-analysis/3239/2\n\nIn conclusion, there isn’t enough data to conclude that changing the pool fees is affecting the volume. With this experiment, the USDC/BNT, USDT/BNT and DAI/BNT pool fees will be set to different values, and an analysis and comparison between them, similar to the analysis on the TRAC pool, will be performed.\n\nIn the end, this trial alongside the TRAC pool one, will hopefully provide more data to assist in choosing appropriate fees to optimize APYs for the LPs. Further experiments may be presented to the DAO if the results from this one are inconclusive.\n\nFor\nChange the pool fees for the USDT/BNT, USDC/BNT and DAI/BNT to 1%, 0.5%, and 0.2%.\n\nAgainst\n\nKeep the pool fees for the USDC/BNT, USDT/BNT and DAI/BNT at 0.2%.",

Make sure to stake your vBNT for voting before this date and time to participate in the DAO decision.\n\n# TL;DR\n\n* Proposal to whitelist DAO.\n* Trading Liquidity of 100,000 BNT.\n* There are no security concerns that could prohibit whitelist status.\n\n* There is no reason to doubt the legitimacy of DAO Maker. The project was conceptualised in 2017 and has raised over $43 million of funds on the platform for companies.\n\n* The benefit to Bancor is clear. Providing DAO liquidity will attract token LPs from DAO Maker to swap on Bancor, and increase protocol trade volume. Further integrations include having Bancor has a first provider of liquidity for projects launched on the platform.\n\n### Token Address: [0x0f51bb10119727a7e5ea3538074fb341f56b09ad](https://etherscan.io/address/0x0f51bb10119727a7e5ea3538074fb341f56b09ad)\n\n### Project Website: [DAO Maker](https://daomaker.com/)\n\n# Liquidity\n\nThe Deepest DAO pools are:\n\nThe DAO/WETH Sushiswap pool with $768,441.44 liquidity and a 7 day average APY of 43.93% [1].\n\nThe DAO/USDC Uniswap v2 pool with $3,316,672.88 liquidity and a 7 day average APY of 15.43% [2].\n\nA trading liquidity of 100,000 BNT opens up space for at least $692k liquidity in the pool, with BNT at $3.46. If the pool fills up, a trading liquidity limit increase will be proposed.\n\n# Token Security\n\nDAO does not have an elastic supply, or rebase mechanism. The DAO token has a max supply cap of 277,524,000 DAO. Contracts are standard ERC-20 OpenZeppelin contracts. The contracts don’t have any permissions that grant administrators unrestricted mint/burn capabilities.\n\nDAO has an S4 “Very Good” safety score on [Valid Network](https://data.valid.network/explore/asset/0x0f51bb10119727a7e5ea3538074fb341f56b09ad).\n\nThe top 15 contract and addresses with the highest concentration of DAO are the GnosisSafe multisig contracts and proxies, staking and farming contracts, KuCoin, Gate.io, OKEx and the DAO-USDC Uniswap v2 pool.\n\n![|602x381](upload://xlwxLLGarE0eQ8hjd1ajVTfzGmh.jpeg)\n\nFigure 1 - Top 15 contract and address with the highest concentration of DAO [3]\n\n# Project\n\nDAO Maker is a platform that aims to redefine venture capital for the masses, by providing scalable technologies and funding support to tokenized startups. This venture capital fund was first conceptualized in 2017. It has since evolved to create low turnout frameworks, which has enabled many retail investors and individuals to become active in venture capital. When funding through DAO Maker, the risks for both parties – the investors and the startups – are significantly reduced.\n\nThe DAO Pad is a multi-investment platform that allows DAO Maker’s community members to stake DAO tokens into the DAO Maker Vault. This allows them to participate in public, private and seed rounds of funding, thereby incentivizing the most loyal and active members.\n\nDAO Maker energizes the community and encourages them to participate in the progress and expansion of the projects hosted on the platform through social mining. Social mining allows startups to leverage token holders to become successful decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs). This improves the economic output of token holders, reduces free-ridership issues and turns flippers into holders. It also offers various risk levels to accommodate a wide range of risk appetites, thereby significantly expanding the audience.\n\nMore information can be found on the official [website](daomaker.com), on the [Whitepaper](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1tPRMktnros6ifJLfvQkrT6mAmEJvUufT) and on the DAO Maker [Economics Paper](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1tPRMktnros6ifJLfvQkrT6mAmEJvUufT).\n\n# Tokenomics\n\nThe DAO Maker token (DAO) is the governance token of the DAO Maker ecosystem, which is built on the Ethereum blockchain and allows holders to exercise control over the ecosystem. Since late 2020, DAO Maker has conducted a series of dynamic coin offerings, raising a total of more than $8 million. The token aims to build a decentralized ecosystem, which will serve as a go-to platform for retail venture investing in equity and tokens.\n\nThere are about 36 million DAO coins in circulation, with a maximum supply of 312 million coins. About 20% of the max supply will be issued to the team, 5% to the advisors and future team, 24.6% for private sale and only 0.4% for public sale. The remaining 50% will go to DAO-managed foundations as customer incentives, for the ecosystem growth, among others. The distribution schedule is expected to take about 51 months.\n\n# Community and Communication\n\nDAO Maker is active on [Telegram](https://t.me/daomaker). The DAO Maker team also operates an official [Twitter](https://twitter.com/thedaomaker) account, and [Medium](https://medium.com/daomaker).\n\n# Available Audits\n\nDAO Maker contracts have been audited by [Certik](https://www.certik.com/projects/daomaker) and [Hacken](https://hacken.io/audits/#dao_maker).\n\n# Market and Trading Data\n\n* DAO’s price at the time of writing is $4.80.\n\n* All-time high: $8.71 (21st April, 2021).\n\n* All-time low: $1.24 (22nd July, 2021).\n\n* Price 90 days ago: $2.49.\n\n* 68,265,600 DAO in circulation, with a maximum and total supply of 277,524,000 DAO.\n\n* The current market capitalization is $328,749,750.\n\n* The DAO token is available on Gate.io, Kucoin, Uniswap (V2), OKEx, Sushiswap, BitZ, 1inch Exchange, Hoo, Hotbit, AEX, Bibox, Uniswap (V3), Indodax and CoinBene.\n\n[1] https://analytics.sushi.com/pairs/0x96f5b7c2be10dc7de02fa8858a8f1bd19c2fa72a\n\n[2] https://v2.info.uniswap.org/pair/0x4cd36d6f32586177e36179a810595a33163a20bf\n\n[3] https://etherscan.io/token/0x0f51bb10119727a7e5ea3538074fb341f56b09ad#balances",

Make sure to stake your vBNT for voting before this date and time to participate in the DAO decision.\n\nTo pass, this proposal needs 35% quorum and 66.7% supermajority.\n\n# TL;DR\n1. The LM rewards on stablecoin pools (DAI, USDC, USDT) are extended from the 12th January until 23rd February 2022 (another 6 weeks), and can continue being extended by the DAO.\n2. The LM rewards are extended to maintain current stable pools protocol’s liquidity in anticipation of Bancor V3.\n3. To support the flawless migration, a new liquidity mining program will be released together with the Bancor V3 release.\n\n# Discussion\n\n* At this stage, current protocol growth requires LM to maintain the momentum and stay competitive in the space (the DAO seems aware of this).\n* After achieving the position of market leader in both TVL and volume, LM extension will no longer be necessary, and the voting for LM extensions may be concluded.\n* Bancor V3 will significantly reduce the pressure resulting from insurance on all the assets, and should increase the protocol revenue from trading fees.\n* A large majority of the LM rewards are re-staked to the protocol, increasing the TVL and the space available for TKN deposits with single sided exposure. If this trend continues, the LM program is more of an asset than a liability, and can be managed more assertively.\n* In the long term, Bancor is aiming towards sustainable annual inflation of 2%, in order to achieve that, Bancor requires significant volume and Vortex to be applied.\n\n# Summary\n\n* Bancor should not lose the momentum and cut out the LM rewards on stablecoins.\n* The current LM rewards will be changed together with the release of Bancor V3.\n* Current stable tokens liquidity is essential to stay in the ecosystem to maintain the protocol momentum and support the migration of liquidity from v2.1 to V3.\n\n# Volume and fees\n\nWeekly volume and fees from the USDC, DAI and USDT pools from the week of the 30th of August have been consistent (Figure 1 and 2).\n\n![Screenshot 2021-12-28 at 12.21.53|690x178](upload://nS3ZNpTelZqV4z5gdSmY3QUQkoF.jpeg)\nFigure 1 - Weekly Fees for DAI, USDC and USDT pools.\n\n![Screenshot 2021-12-28 at 12.22.33|690x176](upload://rQgixV34XJaBAZkJ1D7k839Mas9.jpeg)\n\nFigure 2 - Weekly volume for DAI, USDC and USDT pools.",

      "title": "Onboard New RocketPool (RPL) token with 1M BNT trading liquidity",
      "content": "For this proposal to pass, it requires 40% quorum and 66.7% supermajority.\n\n### This proposal is expected to appear on Snapshot for voting on [date=2022-01-02 time=17:00:00 timezone=\"Europe/Lisbon\"]. Make sure to stake your vBNT for voting before this date and time to participate in the DAO decision.\n\n# TL;DR\n\n* The RPL Team migrated their token contract last month. A new pool for the new RPL token contract should be created and whitelisted so the liquidity can migrate.\n* Currently the RPL/BNT pool has a trading liquidity limit of 1M. The suggested trading liquidity limit for the new RPL/BNT pool is 1M.\n\n#### OLD Contract Address : 0xB4EFd85c19999D84251304bDA99E90B92300Bd93\n\n#### NEW Contract Address : 0xd33526068d116ce69f19a9ee46f0bd304f21a51f\n\n#### Project Website:[ https://www.rocketpool.net/](https://www.rocketpool.net/)\n\n# **Token Security**\n\nThe new RPL token does not have an elastic supply, or rebase mechanism. The new contracts are standard ERC-20 OpenZeppelin contracts. The contracts don’t have any permissions that grant administrators unrestricted mint/burn capabilities.\n\nMore information about the token migration can be found on the Rocket Pool's medium post.\nhttps://medium.com/rocket-pool/rocket-pool-rpl-token-upgrade-new-addresses-e96c12c55adf\n\n# **Project Info**\n\nRocket Pool is an Ethereum 2.0 staking pool. The protocol seeks to lower both the capital and hardware requirements for staking on ETH 2.0, adding to the decentralization and security of Ethereum. To achieve this, Rocket Pool allows users to stake trustlessly towards a network of node operators.\n\nRocket Pool smart contracts accept ETH deposits, assign them to node operators, and issue & track various tokens (RPL/rETH) and handle interactions with the beacon chain. They can also detect if a smart node in the network has gone down and will automatically disable it from receiving any new users until it is repaired. The Smart Node Network is a decentralised network of specialzied Ethereum nodes that run on Rocket Pool's Smart Node software. This software provides custom background processes that allow it to communicate with Rocket Pool’s smart contracts, and just as importantly, provide the network consensus required by the beacon chain.",

In this case, the events are the proposal votes.\n\nThis proposal aims to activate the snapshot plugin POAP-module and for POAPs to start being issued to voters on every future proposal on Snapshot.\n\n### GOAL\n\n* Increase governance participation with minimal cost and effort by using POAP NFTs.\n* Increase community engagement.\n* Analyse voter participation.\n\n### User Workflow\n\n1. User votes on the proposal.\n2. The plugin detects the vote and displays the “Claim POAP” button.\n3. User clicks “Claim POAP”. Then, the custom POAP is automatically sent to the voter’s wallet.\n\n### Types of Bancor POAPs:\n\n* Bancor Improvement Proposals.\n* Whitelistings.\n* Trading Liquidity Changes.\n* Liquidity Mining Changes.\n* Fee Changes.\n* Others - special events such as v3 launch, Temperature Checks, etc.\n\n### Benefits\n\n* Help promote governance participation through incentivization (vote and receive an exclusive POAP).\n* Help prove an individual’s commitment and engagement to Bancor’s future.\n* Fees are negligible as POAP uses the xDAI network.\n* Available metrics to show voter participation for each proposal.\n* Optional: reward community participation through the POAP prize raffle system (https://poap.fun/).\n\n[Example of snapshot proposal with POAP activated ](https://snapshot.org/#/sushigov.eth/proposal/QmcwEVRfidkg5U8n3Z9CWgZfb63Fdy9Gy3BPX9z6xZL7nr)\n\nMore information [here](https://medium.com/poap/what-is-poap-d7e8fdfc207d) and [here](https://docs.snapshot.org/plugins/poap).",

      "content": "## Proposal to increase the trading liquidity limit in the PSP-BNT pool to 300K BNT\n\nFor this proposal to pass, it requires a 35% quorum and 66.7% supermajority.\n\nThis proposal is expected to appear on Snapshot for voting on [date=2022-01-02 timezone=\"Europe/Lisbon\"]. Make sure to stake your vBNT for voting before this date and time to participate in the DAO decision.\n\n### TL;DR\n* The PSP-BNT pool was recently [whitelisted](https://gov.bancor.network/t/proposal-whitelist-paraswap-psp-100k-bnt-co-invest/3193) and is currently at $1,271,300 liquidity. The Paraswap DAO agreed to allocate 1.5m PSP to provide liquidity on the PSP-BNT pool.\n* The pool currently has space for 120,508 PSP.\n* This proposal aims to increase the trading liquidity from 200k BNT to 300k BNT to open up space to increase liquidity in the pool.\n\n### Rationale\n\n@tenzent proposed allocating a part of the Paraswap treasury to be deposited on Bancor, citing some of its biggest advantages, namely, single-sided staking and impermanent loss protection.\n\nThe proposal passed with 89.29% votes in favor of a 1.5m PSP allocation at the time of writing, and can be found on their [snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/paraswap-dao.eth/proposal/0x7929cea9160fd9c4c5e0905ae3071a6a759ed27a15288ec6241a566bed02d529).\n\nThe pool is now at $1,271,300 liquidity. The PSP/WETH pool on Sushiswap is the deepest source of liquidity on a DEX, at $2,583,696.64 liquidity [1]. Increase the trading limit in this pool would allow for more PSP to be staked single-sided, reducing price impact and increasing volume from aggregators.\n\nTherefore this proposal seeks to increase the trading liquidity limit in the PSP/BNT pool from 200k BNT to 300k BNT, thus opening space for 826,775 PSP extra, with BNT at $3.24 and PSP at $0.391884. The opened space in the PSP/BNT pool would allow it to have a $1.944m liquidity if the space is filled.\n\n\nFOR\nIncrease trading liquidity in the PSP-BNT pool for a second time to 300k BNT.\n\nAGAINST\nKeep the trading liquidity in the PSP-BNT pool at 200k BNT.\n\n\n[1] https://analytics.sushi.com/pairs/0x458ae80894a0924ac763c034977e330c565f1687",

The process is described in detail both on the Rari Capital DAO Improvement Proposals page, and the Fei Protocol Discourse page.\n\nOn the Fei Protocol side, the proposal is officially recognized under the title “FIP-51”, although it was launched to Snapshot as “FIP-XX”. There are two follow-up governance decisions from the Fei community related to the merger, “Amendment 1 to FIP-51”, and “FIP-XX: GFX Labs Compensation”.\n\nOn the Rari Capital side, the relevant Snapshot decisions were the “Amended Fei-Rari Merger Proposal”, “GFX Labs Compensation”, “Hold 7-Day Discussion Period on Merger”, “Exchange Rate Amendment to the RGT/TRIBE Merger Proposal”, and “Extend Merger Timeline by ~4 Days to Allow for Sufficient Discussion and Voting of Amendments”.\n\nA cursory review of these community votes suggests that the merger will indeed go ahead. The UI is already established, and the official Fei Protocol Twitter handle shared it on Christmas eve, and Rari Capital DAO announced via their Twitter handle that they consider themselves officially merged already.\n$RGT is Exchangeable for $TRIBE, and Will Be Discontinued\n\nThe interaction between these two tokens is potentially problematic while $TRIBE slowly buys-out $RGT. Since $RGT will soon not exist, all future deposits to the pool should be disabled immediately. As a precautionary measure, deposits to the $TRIBE pool should also be temporarily disabled until the token merger has completed. For now, let the “completeness” remain undefined; a follow-up proposal will be issued in the near future to reactivate deposits on the $TRIBE pool.",

      "title": "Whitelist BBS Token with External IL Protection",
      "content": "# TL;DR\n\n* BBS is a new project aimed at creating a “decentralized reddit” in which the ad revenue is fairly distributed between the people who make the message board great.\n* This means we are building a consumer application for the mass market, with blockchain sitting under the hood, and with Bancor being the chief source of liquidity and volume.\n* We will run a staking rewards campaign, rewarding stakers with more BBS tokens.\n* We will supply all the initial liquidity in BBS tokens.\n* Once Bancor releases a standard mechanism for externally covering IL protection costs, we will adopt it, covering BBS’s IL with a pool of tokens specifically allocated for this purpose.\n* We are asking for the token to be whitelisted with an initial co-investment of 100,000 BNT from a very early stage.\n\nToken Contract: https://etherscan.io/address/0xFe459828c90c0BA4bC8b42F5C5D44F316700B430#code\n\nProject Website: https://www.bbsnetwork.io/\n\n# Token Security\n\nThe token contract is a very basic OpenZeppelin ERC20 contract with OpenZeppelin’s implementation of the permit mechanism. It has no burn or pause capabilities.\n\n# Project\n\nThe BBS project is aimed at correcting this historical injustice of ad revenue distribution on social network applications. It can be thought of as a decentralized reddit, where everypost is a revenue generating NFT, and the revenue gets automatically distributed between the actors that make the revenue flow - writers, moderators, operators, and so forth.\n\n# Tokenomics\n\nThe BBS token is the native currency of the BBS network, so the fundamental model is as follows:\n\n1. Advertisers use BBS to purchase highly segmented ad space\n2. Royalties from this purchase are divided between the creators\n3. Creators sell BBS tokens to cash-out their earnings\n\nIn addition:\n\n4. Token holders can lock their tokens in a staking contract, earning further rewards\n5. Long term token stakers can vote on governance proposals concerning funds allocation, upgrades, standards and integrations - enabling all BBSs to function as a single network\n\nAs a mass market, consumer facing product, it will require a lot of liquidity. To provide this liquidity is a costly business because of the so-called “impermanent loss” (which, in this case, can be quite permanent), and it is very clear why the Bancor network will be hesitant to undertake it alone, and it makes a lot of sense for the BBS project itself to shoulder a significant part of this cost.\n\nIt is therefore that we are more than happy to adopt Bancor’s new model of handling IL protection, and to allocate a large pool of tokens specifically for this purpose.\n\nUntil this option becomes available, the DAO will handle and fund the liquidity pool on the Bancor network, burning all BNTs gained from IL protection.\n\n# Community and Communication\n\nHomepage:[ https://bbsnetwork.i](https://bbsnetwork.io)o\n\nLive Product:[ https://bbs.marke](https://bbs.market)t\n\nTwitter: @[BBSnetworkIO](https://twitter.com/bbsnetworkio)\n\nTelegram: @[BBSnet](https://t.me/bbsnet)\n\n## Top currently active message boards (14k new users in the past month)\n\n* [Star Wars Theory](https://starwarstheory.com/THEORY)\n* [The Den of Nerds](https://thedenofnerds.com/NERDY/posts)\n* [Meta-BBS ](https://bbs.market/METABBS/posts)\n* [Golden Popolitics](https://bbs.market/GOLDEN/posts)\n\n# Available Audits\n\n* [Peckshield](https://peckshield.com/): [Audit Report 2021-07](https://github.com/deweb-io/token/blob/master/docs/audit.peckshield.2021.07.pdf)\n* [Peckshield](https://peckshield.com/): [Audit Report 2021-11](https://github.com/deweb-io/token/blob/master/docs/audit.peckshield.2021.11.pdf)\n\n# Benefits to Bancor\n\n* Mass market consumer product with liquidity handled by Bancor, leading to a dominant share of the global trading volume\n* Liquidity entirely covered and managed by the DAO, which is committed to burning all BNT tokens gained from IL protection\n* Early adoption of externally supplied IL protection when available\n* Low risk of IL protection costs due to the two above clauses\n\nVote For: To whitelist BBS with a co investment of 100,000 BNT\n\nVote Against: To not whitelist BBS",

      "content": "**TLDR**\n\n* This proposal seeks to increase the trading liquidity to **2M $BNT** for the **$wNXM** pool from the current **1M $BNT** .\n* It will open up space for LPs on the TKN side ( **$wNXM** ) and increase the depth of the pool as LPs add liquidity\n* A larger **$wNXM** pool will attract more trades from aggregators and professional market makers to Bancor which ultimately leads to more fees for our platform.\n\n**For**\n\n1. An increase in $BNT trading liquidity will let LPs stake single-sided and lead to an increase in pool depth\n2. More liquidity in the **wNXM-BNT** pool should lead to larger volume from DEX aggregators and professional market makers sent in our direction\n3. More volume for Bancor leads to more fees for our platform and **$BNT** holders\n\n**Against**\n\n1. We should not increase the co-investment limit on the pool or lower its fees\n\n**Abstract**\nThere are currently **~2M $BNT** and **~104.5K $wNXM** tokens in the BNT-wNXM [pool](https://etherscan.io/address/0x5A29f970788F3494f6350207fc91DaD0d6e8C184). This has resulted in a pool that has roughly **~14.6M** in liquidity. This proposal seeks to increase the **$wNXM** pool’s single-sided capacity by increasing the trading liquidity to **2M $BNT** from the current **1M $BNT**.\n\n![image|475x302](upload://1fLtRvFLuEg3Ozoc7Lssd75je3M.png)\n\n**Motivation**\n\nIf we want to attract more wNXM LPs to Bancor, we need to open up space in the pool so that they can provide single-sided liquidity. This would allow us to grow the liquidity in the pool and attract larger trades towards our platform which ultimately results in higher fees for Bancor.\n\nThe top pool for wNXM is on Uniswap V3 and it is paired with ETH. Pool depth is roughly **7.8M**:\n\n![image|438x500](upload://xh5z6oUQnoaxsnRMpFmyyEa4DNt.png)\n\nThere is also a smaller pool on Uniswap V2 with 900K in liquidity:\n\n![image|413x500](upload://pbotoc6wlM5GbPx4l9h9qGLPlrC.png)\n\nCurrently, the Bancor pool has no space available and LPs can’t provide single-sided liquidity on the TKN side ($wNXM). I am proposing a **2M** Co-investment limit for the $wNXM pool.",

      "content": "# TL;DR\n\n* Proposal to whitelist DerivaDAO Token (DDX).\n* Proposed Trading Liquidity is **100K BNT**.\n* There are no apparent security concerns that would prohibit whitelist status.\n\n### Token Address: [0x3a880652f47bfaa771908c07dd8673a787daed3a](https://etherscan.io/address/0x3a880652f47bfaa771908c07dd8673a787daed3a)\n\n### Project Website: [derivadex.com](https://derivadex.com/)\n\n# Token Security\n\nDDX does not have an elastic supply or rebase mechanism. The [token contract](https://etherscan.io/address/0x3a880652f47bfaa771908c07dd8673a787daed3a#code#F41) appears to implement the standard openzeppelin libraries in addition to the [diamond standard](https://medium.com/derivadex/the-diamond-standard-a-new-paradigm-for-upgradeability-569121a08954).\n\nThe total token supply is capped at **100M** tokens and it is emitted over a 10-year period. The current [circulating](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/derivadao) supply is **26,094,663**\n\nThe top 5 holders of DDX are the following (To Be Determined):\n\nRank1: gnosis multisig\nRank2: team/founder\nRank3: team/founder\nRank4: investor\nRank5: team/investor/exchange\n\n![image|690x310](upload://gTlTluZcgxTk0LC90QxDH0W3ny6.png)\n\n# Project\n\nDerivaDAO is the decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) that governs DerivaDEX, a decentralized exchange (DEX) for derivative contracts built on Ethereum. It features an open order book and on-chain settlement, and leverages off-chain price feeds, matching engines, and liquidation operators to enable fast and efficient transactions of synthetic assets. \n\nDeposits and withdrawals (of USDC) are handled on Ethereum, whereas all trading and other exchange-related transactions occur on the DerivaDEX operator network. Two tranches of insurance funds, “staked” (from insurance mining) and “organic” (from USD-paid fees) are managed by the DerivaDAO and used to backstop traders against auto-deleveraging.\n\n# Tokenomics\n\n* 100,000,000 DDX are emitted over a 10-year period. There is no additional supply or inflation planned for DDX\n* 50 million DDX are emitted initially as part of the genesis supply. This is referred to as “genesis token emission” throughout.\n* 50 million DDX are emitted over a 10-year period as part of the liquidity mining supply.\n\n![newplot (1)|663x454](upload://5dDmmmioJo2dO7dW3OCAbzHAEMh.png)\n\n* 34,245,404 DDX allocated to the team and foundation \n* 15,334,596 DDX allocated to investors \n* 660,000 DDX for an advisor allocation \n\n![newplot|663x454](upload://bJcO6605RJfdUMf3ILY6e1U8KyR.png)\n\nThe DerivaDAO manages more than the supply of DDX tokens. The DerivaDAO is also responsible for managing all parameters of the exchange: listing products, determining the capitalization of the insurance fund, setting trading fees. A unique feature of DerivaDEX is the requirement for the exchange to build and maintain a healthy **insurance fund** . Unlike centralized exchanges, this DAO-managed fund will have transparent parameters set via governance.\n\nThe management of this fund’s size and implementation is the responsibility of DerivaDAO participants. This resource will be initially capitalized by the insurance mining program, and later capitalized via trading fees and liquidations. The collateral types that are accepted to the insurance fund, and the balancing of various collateral types, is subject to DerivaDAO governance.\n\n# Community and Communication\n\nThe DerivaDAO team operates an official [Twitter](https://twitter.com/DDX_Official) and [medium](https://medium.com/derivadex) account. The repositories for their code is hosted on [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/derivadex). There is a [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/uR2Kt4Q) channel that is available to their community. The official documentation is hosted on [TBD](). There is also a [governance app](https://governance.derivadex.com/) that's available to their community members for governance and a [forum](https://forum.derivadex.com/) as well.\n\n# Available Audits\n\nAll DerivaDEX code related to governance, token emission, and insurance mining has been audited by Quantstamp, including specification review, manual review of code as well as testing and automated analysis. The full code review can be found [here](https://certificate.quantstamp.com/full/deriva-dex).\n\n# Market and Trading Data\n\n* DDX price at the time of writing is $4.96\n* All-time high: $15.28  (Aug 31, 2021)\n* All-time low: $1.48 (Jul 19, 2021)\n* Price 90 days ago: $6.98\n* 26,094,663 tokens in [circulation](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/derivadao)\n* 100,000,000 maximum supply.\n* The current market capitalization is $129,441,386\n* Token Fully Diluted market Capitalization is around $496,045,426\n* The DDX token is available on DEX (Sushiswap and Uniswap) and CEX (Coinbase)",

For many, the update is trivial. The blog post has stated that RSR holders using any centralized exchange, or popular software or hardware wallet are essentially already covered:\n\n“If you are currently holding RSR in a centralized exchange or popular wallet (both software or hardware), no action will be required from your end. The Reserve team is currently in the process of contacting all relevant entities to update RSR’s contract address, which will result in your RSR balance automatically being updated to the new contract.”\n\nUnfortunately, for those participating in DeFi with the RSR token, it is not so easy:\n\n“However, if you are currently staking RSR on a decentralized platform such as Uniswap, Balancer or Bancor, you need to withdraw your staked funds before 01/13/2022 11:59 PM UTC or your funds will be irreversibly locked forever. The reason behind this is that these decentralized platforms use hardcoded contract addresses for each pool. After 01/13/2022 11:59 PM UTC, the current RSR contract (used in these pools) will no longer allow any sort of transaction.”",

Users can also interact and make transactions to the contract directly on...\n\nProject Website: **[https://sator.io ](https://sator.io/)**\n\n**Sator**\n\nSator is a decentralized application designed to scale and expand linear content (Television, Film, Music, Streamers) to a more immersive content engagement experience. Audiences are incentivized by social utility token rewards (SAO) and content-based NFTs in the Sator dApp marketplace. Content creators, producers, and content rights holders simultaneously grow audience and global reach. Sator Network (SAO) runs on Ethereum and Solana, utilizing Wormhole bridge for bidirectional transfers and cross-chain interoperability. Sator contributes to the ecosystem as a whole by pioneering NFT utility in traditional media/television/film/music content and by incentivizing centralized rights holders to diffuse value throughout the ecosystem.\n\nSator addresses the greatest pain points in content: viewership growth, viewer engagement, subscribership growth & retention. Plus, Sator is the first mechanism to align the interests of content viewers and distributors by rewarding them both for their respective contributions. Sator also pushes NFT innovation ahead by embedding show-specific NFTs with extremely unique utility, profile-display features, and experiential relevance. Sator is building a content engagement metaverse — the Satorverse.\n\n**Sator Team?**\n\nSator’s world-class team of 20+ includes top engineering talent, designers, marketers, to name a few.\n\nSator Founders met at Consensus 2017 and immediately bonded over the future of blockchain. In the years that followed, ideas and research were shared. A group of television producers asked the Sator Founders “how blockchain can help grow and retain viewership” and that catalyzed early thinking about how Sator unlocks potential at the intersection of content and crypto.\n\n**Sator Future Plan?**\n\nSator is officially running on Solana mainnet. We are available in the Google play store and apple app store.\n\nIOS link: [Join the Sator beta - TestFlight - Apple](https://testflight.apple.com/join/W7bXrXLa)\nANDROID link: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.satorio.app\n\n2022 Roadmap and Beyond\nQ1 2022\nMulti-chain expansion\nMachine learning 1.0\nMore games deployment\nNFT utility pioneering\n\nQ2 2022\nAR/VR compatible\nMachine learning 2.0\nGame engine SDK\n\nQ3 2022\nSmartTV compatible\nSAO advertising marketplace\n\nQ4 2022\n1.2mm Sator users\nFully-integrated entertainment & media metaverse\nSator becomes content buyer of TV/film/music\n\n2023\n7-10mm users\n(based on blended data analysis of social apps and crypto apps YoY growth rates)\n\nMachine Learning 1.0: Understand user behavior to improve in-app experience\nMachine Learning 2.0: Advance user metrics inform home page categories e.g. “Suggested For You”\n\n**Tokenomics**\n\nSator’s native token, SAO is built on Solana with a bi-directional bridge to Ethereum (Wrapped ERC20) through Wormhole bridge. Users engage and earn $SAO in our decentralized application, which is directly supported by SAO token.\n\nThe SAO token has a total supply of 500,000,000 tokens. Our initial circulating supply will be less than 4% of those tokens, approximately 20 million SAO. We will not burn tokens.\n\nTokens will also be distributed in a fair method, without the risk of whales dumping them on the new line of investors. Investors and team stay locked for 1 year before incremental monthly unlocks, making it impossible for investors and VCs to dump the token.\n\nThe owners and the team will only receive less than 13% of the whole token distribution, and their tokens will be freed up in a fair and calculatable structure over 4 years time, with no option to sell in the first 11 months.\n\n**Community**\n\nSator completed a successful IDO on DexLab, with lots of support from our community. Sator’s GenShards NFT offering was also completely sold out.  Sator is currently listed on Uniswap and Gate. Our community is extremely excited for a Bancor listing, and we plan for the majority of our SAO ETH liquidity to be on Bancor.\n\n**Coinvestment**\n\nAs SAO is a very new token, we propose to start with 100K BNT Co-investment and will grow this when demand is met.\n\n**Benefits for Bancor**\n\nSator’s mission and vision and both are very much in line with Bancor’s core values. DAO governance and decentralization, presenting a truly decentralized solution for as large a community as possible is just the start. Most important benefit for Bancor will be volume, as that is essentially what drives the fees that allow for Impermanent loss protection. Sator plans for Bancor to be our deepest pool on Ethereum and as a result we expect to get the most volume here.\n\nWe are confident that we can deliver value to Bancor’s users by introducing a token that will be successful thanks to our distribution, value centric tokenomics, and many use cases that SAO token will be supporting.\n\nIMPORTANT!\nETH Contract Audit\nFull disclosure on contract audit: Zokyo did an audit of our original contract code as seen here: https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6836934327004131328/\n\nThis is an audit of our original contract address on Ethereum (the contract they listed in the doc is NOT the contract address Sator token is using). \nSAO token is native to the Solana blockchain, and we used the Wormhole bridge to bridge our native SPL tokens to Ethereum. We did not audit the bridged tokens as we did not deploy a Solidity contract ourselves, we used the Wormhole UI. Our correct contract is verified on Etherscan here: https://etherscan.io/token/0x3EF389f264e07fFF3106A3926F2a166d1393086F?a=0x5c95d9bff0f672562df784a5787eea621a01dbdb#tokenInfo\n\nBy way of the Wormhole bridge, we did not traditionally deploy Solidity contract code. Wormhole bridge attested and verified our SPL tokens and bridged a percentage of our supply to ETH automatically (no contract source code that was deployed from our side). See the process of bridging here: https://wormholebridge.com/#/transfer\n\nThere was no smart contract for us to audit by way of the Wormhole UI. However, we are verified on Etherscan and the Sator team is happy to answer any questions on this.\n\nALSO IMPORTANT!\nTop token holders:\nhttps://solscan.io/token/2HeykdKjzHKGm2LKHw8pDYwjKPiFEoXAz74dirhUgQvq#holders\nPlease note that the top token holder with 77% of the total supply is the Sator team wallet. This is the mint address.\nThe majority of the other top token holders are tokens locked in Bonafida smart contracts. The contracts contain locked tokens and vest over the next ~18 months and more. Happy to answer any specific questions on our vesting schedule, or the Bonafida locked contracts. \n\n\nThank you!\n",

The project was developed by [OMG Foundation](https://twitter.com/omgnetworkhq?lang=en) core contributor Enya and has partnered with Dodo, Coin98, API3, Synapse, BAND Protocol and Anyswap.\n\n* The token was launched on the 20th of September of 2021 and therefore poses a higher impermanent loss protection risk as volatility is expected to be higher than other established tokens.\n\n* The benefit to Bancor is clear. Providing BOBA liquidity will attract token LPs from the Boba community to swap on Bancor, and increase protocol trade volume.\n\n### Token Address: [0x42bbfa2e77757c645eeaad1655e0911a7553efbc](https://etherscan.io/address/0x42bbfa2e77757c645eeaad1655e0911a7553efbc)\n\n### Project Website: [Boba Network](https://boba.network/)\n\n# Liquidity\n\nThe Deepest BOBA pools are:\n\nThe BOBA/WETH DODO pool with $191,176.12 liquidity and a 7 day average APY of 12.99% [1].\n\nThe BOBA/WETH DODO pool with $188,468.93 liquidity and a 7 day average APY of 9.95% [2].\n\nTrading Liquidity of 50,000 BNT opens up space for at least $332k of liquidity in the pool, with BNT at $3.32. If the pool fills up, it would be the deepest in any DEX.\n\n# Token Security\n\nBOBA does not have an elastic supply, or rebase mechanism. The BOBA token has a max supply cap of 500,000,000 BOBA. Contracts are standard ERC-20 OpenZeppelin contracts. The contracts don’t have any permissions that grant administrators unrestricted mint/burn capabilities.\n\nThe top 15 contract and addresses with the highest concentration of BOBA are the Boba Network Deployer and OMG Gateway, FTX, Binance, Huobi, OKEx, team wallets, and wallets with 0.8000%, 0.3956%, 0.2928%, 0.2310%, and 0.1938% of total supply.\n\n![|602x383](upload://lIS38uOXpNJtXQo80xMbvfex4p8.jpeg)\n\nFigure 1 - Top 15 contract and address with the highest concentration of BOBA [3]\n\n# Project\n\nBoba is an L2 Ethereum scaling & augmenting solution built by the Enya team as core contributors to the OMG Foundation. Boba is a next-generation Ethereum Layer 2 Optimistic Rollup scaling solution that reduces gas fees, improves transaction throughput, and extends the capabilities of smart contracts. Boba offers fast exits backed by community-driven liquidity pools, shrinking the Optimistic Rollup exit period from seven days to only a few minutes, while giving LPs incentivized yield farming opportunities.\n\nBoba’s extensible smart contracts will enable developers across the Ethereum ecosystem to build dApps that invoke code executed on web-scale infrastructure such as AWS Lambda, making it possible to use algorithms that are either too expensive or impossible to execute on-chain.\n\n# Tokenomics\n\n$BOBA will be used for governance of the Boba DAO, which will be used for community initiatives and direction for the network’s future.

      "content": "## TLDR\n* Snapshot recently added an Abstain feature, which was discussed in a [thread](https://gov.bancor.network/t/snapshot-feedback/2897) on our governance forum.\n* Choosing to ABSTAIN means that the voting power shall count towards quorum but bear no weight on the FOR and AGAINST options.\n* The Abstain feature is a highly requested one. Voters that don't want to choose a FOR or AGAINST option but still want to contribute to quorum can now do so.\n\n## Abstract\n\nThe Abstain feature was discussed extensively at https://gov.bancor.network/t/snapshot-feedback/2897.\n\nHere is an example of how FOR and AGAINST percentages, as well as Quorum, are calculated:\n\n> FOR: Number of votes casted\n> FOR Percentage: (FOR / FOR + AGAINST)\n> AGAINST: Number of votes casted\n> AGAINST Percentage: (AGAINST / FOR + AGAINST)\n> \n> ABSTAIN: Number of votes casted\n> ABSTAIN Percentage: ABSTAIN / (FOR + AGAINST + ABSTAIN)\n> \n> QUORUM: (FOR + AGAINST + ABSTAIN) / TOTAL STAKED vBNT\n> \n> Note that neither FOR nor AGAINST option is taking into account the ABSTAIN option. We as a DAO can use these to know whether a vote has supermajority requirements (66.7% or greater).\n\nWith real numbers, this would look like the following: \n> 10,000,000 TOTAL STAKED vBNT (for voting)\n> 2,000,000 FOR votes (80%)\n> 500,000 AGAINST (20%)\n> 4,000,000 ABSTAIN (61%)\n> (2,000,000+500,000+4,000,000) / (10,000,000) = 65% QUORUM\n\nA dummy proposal was created on the Bancor snapshot to test the Abstain feature and can be found [here](https://snapshot.org/#/bancornetwork.eth/proposal/0x2a060cca5341d2c8fe1e4a8883a338a243c707f82bae926f768aba1d98cc6386).\n\nFOR\nActivate Abstain feature.\n\nAGAINST\nDon't activate the feature.\n",

      "content": "# TL;DR\n\n* Proposal to whitelist DUSK.\n* Co-investment of 50,000 BNT.\n* Dusk Network is a layer-1 blockchain protocol that will enable Confidential Smart Contracts. The project's focus is to use their own bleeding edge Zero-Knowledge Proofs systems to develop (Decentralized) Financial Applications with strict on-chain data privacy at its core. \n* There are no security concerns that could prohibit whitelist status.\n* There is no reason to doubt the legitimacy of Dusk. The project has been featured in, among others, Forbes, Coindesk and CoinTelegraph and their [Github Repositories](https://github.com/dusk-network) have been acknowledged by lots of external projects and developers.\n\n### Token Address: [0x940a2db1b7008b6c776d4faaca729d6d4a4aa551](https://etherscan.io/address/0x940a2db1b7008b6c776d4faaca729d6d4a4aa551)\n\n### Project Website: [Dusk Network](https://dusk.network/)\n\n# Liquidity\n\nThe Deepest DUSK pools are:\n\nThe DUSK/USDT Uniswap v3 pool with $11.72k liquidity, $21.03k daily volume, and an extrapolated APR from the 24hr fees of 196.45% [1].\n\nThe DUSK/WBNB PancakeSwap v2 pool with $620.70K liquidity, $118.94K daily volume, and an extrapolated APR from the 24hr fees of 11.89% [2].\n\nA co-investment of 50,000 BNT opens up space for at least $332k of liquidity in the pool, with BNT at $3.32. If the pool fills up, it would be the deepest in any DEX.\n\n# Token Security\n\nDUSK does not have an elastic supply, or rebase mechanism. The DUSK token has a max supply cap of 1,000,000,000 DUSK. Contracts are standard ERC-20 OpenZeppelin contracts. The contracts don’t have any permissions that grant administrators unrestricted mint/burn capabilities.\n\nDUSK has a \"Very Good S4\" safety score on [valid.network](https://data.valid.network/explore/asset/0x940a2db1b7008b6c776d4faaca729d6d4a4aa551).\n\n# Project\n\nDusk Network describes itself as a blockchain for programmable and confidential securities, powered by Zero-Knowledge proofs and novel Private PoS leader extraction-based consensus protocol. Dusk Network is a privacy blockchain for financial applications. It is a layer-1 blockchain that powers the Confidential Security Contract (XSC) standard, and supports native confidential smart contracts.\n\nDusk Network aims to address the requirements and needs of financial markets. Central to its design is a scalable public infrastructure, direct settlement finality of transactions, and strict data privacy.\n\n* Direct settlement finality. A distributed Financial Market Infrastructure (dFMI) should provide clear and final settlement of transactions. On Dusk Network transactions are fast, take seconds to complete, and achieve immediate on-chain finality.\n\n* Privacy. Dusk Network provides full user privacy and enables decentralized applications and third-parties to adhere to strict compliance requirements whilst still offering data privacy. This increases the ability to perform business processes on-chain, leading to significant cost reduction.\n\n* Public. Users do not need the approval of a trusted authority to use the Dusk Network blockchain. Besides, only minimal processing power and modest IT resources to join. All users who possess the DUSK token can participate in the consensus.\n\n# Tokenomics\n\nDUSK tokens can be used as a utility token to initiate transactions and atomic swaps, or for the deployment of smart contracts. DUSK can also be staked to participate in consensus and serves as a means of exchanging DUSK-denominated value. In the future, the team intends to expand the use-cases of DUSK by adding it to an on-chain governance system.\n\n# Community and Communication\n\nDusk Network is active on [Telegram](https://t.me/DuskNetwork). The Dusk Network team also operates official [Twitter](https://twitter.com/DuskFoundation), and [Blog](https://dusk.network/pages/all-posts) accounts.\n\n# Available Audits\n\nDusk Network was audited by Cyber Unit on their [Prestaking Provisioner](https://github.com/dusk-network/prestaking-provisioner/blob/master/docs/audit_report.pdf) and [Prestaking Contracts]\n\n# Market and Trading Data\n\nThe DUSK token has seen a nice upward momentum in both price and volume the past few weeks. Underlining Dusk Network's focus on Zero-Knowledge Proofs is the [Endgame Paper](https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/12/06/endgame.html) from Vitalik, which confirms the importance of Zero-Knowledge for the whole blockchain industry on privacy- and scaling opportunities. Dusk Network will continue to play a leading role in the Zero-Knowledge sector.\n\n* DUSK's price at the time of writing is $0.194744.\n* 383,163,706 DUSK in circulation, with a maximum supply of 1,000,000,000 DUSK and a total supply of 500,000,000 DUSK.\n* The current market capitalization is $74,618,821.\n",

The FXS token was created from genesis with a deflationary supply of 100,000,000 FXS. Contracts are standard ERC-20 OpenZeppelin contracts with some modifications. The contracts don’t have any permissions that grant administrators unrestricted mint/burn capabilities.\n\nFXS has a \"Very Good S4\" safety score on [valid.network](https://data.valid.network/explore/asset/0x3432b6a60d23ca0dfca7761b7ab56459d9c964d0).\n\n\n# Project\n\nFrax is the first fractional-algorithmic stablecoin protocol. Frax is open-source, permissionless, and entirely on-chain – currently implemented on Ethereum and other chains. The end goal of the Frax protocol is to provide a highly scalable, decentralized, algorithmic money in place of fixed-supply digital assets like BTC.\n\nFrax is a new paradigm in stablecoin design. It brings together familiar concepts into a never before seen protocol:\n\n* **Fractional-Algorithmic** – Frax is the first and only stablecoin with parts of its supply backed by collateral and parts of the supply algorithmic. This means FRAX is the first stablecoin to have part of its supply floating/unbacked. The stablecoin (FRAX) is named after the \"fractional-algorithmic\" stability mechanism. The ratio of collateralized and algorithmic depends on the market's pricing of the FRAX stablecoin. If FRAX is trading at above $1, the protocol decreases the collateral ratio. If FRAX is trading at under $1, the protocol increases the collateral ratio.\n* **Fully on-chain oracles** – Frax v1 uses Uniswap (ETH, USDT, USDC time-weighted average prices) and Chainlink (USD price) oracles.\n\n* **Two Tokens** – FRAX is the stablecoin targeting a tight band around $1/coin. Frax Shares (FXS) is the governance token which accrues fees, seigniorage revenue, and excess collateral value.\n\nMore information on the Frax Finance project can be found [here](https://docs.frax.finance/overview).\n\n# Tokenomics\n\nThe Frax Share token (FXS) is the non-stable, utility token in the protocol. It is meant to be volatile and hold rights to governance and all utility of the system. It is important to note that we take a highly governance-minimized approach to designing trustless money in the same ethos as Bitcoin. We eschew DAO-like active management such as MakerDAO. The less parameters for a community to be able to actively manage, the less there is to disagree on. Parameters that are up for governance through FXS include adding/adjusting collateral pools, adjusting various fees (like minting or redeeming), and refreshing the rate of the collateral ratio. No other actions such as active management of collateral or addition of human-modifiable parameters are possible other than a hardfork that would require voluntarily moving to a new implementation entirely.\n\nMore information can be found in the Frax Finance documentation [here](https://docs.frax.finance/seigniorage).\n\n\n# Available Audits\n\nFrax Finance was audited by [Trail Of Bits](https://github.com/trailofbits/publications/blob/master/reviews/FraxFinance.pdf) in June 2021, and [Certik](https://www.certik.com/projects/fraxfinance) pre-launch.

      "title": "Proposal: Increase Co-Investment Limit to 1M on ARCONA Pool",
      "content": "## This proposal is expected to appear on Snapshot for voting on [date=2021-12-05 time=12:00:00 timezone=\"UTC\"]. Make sure to stake your vBNT for voting before this date and time to participate in the DAO decision.\n\n##### Contract Address: [0x0f71b8de197a1c84d31de0f1fa7926c365f052b3]\nProject website: **https://www.arcona.space**\n\n## TL;DR\n- Create extra space for ARCONA deposits.\n- Enable a limit change from 500,000 BNT up to 1,000,000 BNT minting limits on ARCONABNT pool\n- Vote “for” to enable this change, or vote “against” not to enable it.\n\n## Background Info:\n[After Facebook announced of Meta with metaverse concept], we got a big rush of new blood. It's a good chance to increase our market impact. **For the last month**, [the liquidity in the pool of the Bancor network exceeded $5.3M], [MCap increased x10 to 20M], and there are still a lot of people willing to contribute assets to the pool. This move helped strengthen the ARCONA token and expand our community.  ARCONA seems to be performing well now. ARCONA during at the month show big APY, now it's over 50%. There is no room in the pool for more ARCONA LPs. There is no active LM rewards on the ARCONA pool, and not everyone interesting add liquidity for second side(BNT) of ARCONABNT.\nTherefore, we propose to vote to increase the size of co-investment from 500 thousands BNT to 1 million BNT. The possibility of one-way staking encourages our token holders to use the Bancor protocol more actively and to increase the pool size. As liquidity deepens, so will the yield on swaps for LP. The Team working for the listing of CEX too. There are has a good chance increase price liquidity in the pool else. Now the team prepare to launch **Play to Earn** conception into metaverse reality. That's attracted a lot of new users.\nThe [Arcona XR Metaverse] team apricate participation in the results of Arcona liqudity pool, and want to do some gifts(I think NFT) to voters. When i get last info, i will update this post.\n![](upload://1QJfGwNBwD9zutZGjcJGiOK57Hp.png)\n\n[Arcona XR Metaverse]: <https://www.arcona.space>\n[After Facebook announced of Meta with metaverse concept]: <https://about.fb.com/news/2021/10/facebook-company-is-now-meta/>\n[the liquidity in the pool of the Bancor network exceeded $5.3M]: <https://etherscan.io/address/0x0c898e4e13b73364648c20d9e3c7ddb3a2a6788e>\n[MCap increased x10 to 20M]: <https://etherscan.io/token/0x0f71b8de197a1c84d31de0f1fa7926c365f052b3>\n[0x0f71b8de197a1c84d31de0f1fa7926c365f052b3]: <https://etherscan.io/token/0x0f71b8de197a1c84d31de0f1fa7926c365f052b3>",

They would like to continue to use the Bancor pool in connection with its Saas licensing fee proxy eRSDL open market purchase program, and LM would allow increased TVL and decreased slippage.\n* The eRSDL open market purchase program corresponds to the use of digital markets, denominated in eRSDL, used to record the licensing subscription of our software by various operating entities. Purchasing of eRSDL out of the market will be done at regular intervals coinciding with the level of borrowing across our products. Terms may vary.\n* UnfederalReserve has listed Bancor as a place to swap BNT on https://unfederalreserve.com/.

      "title": "Proposal: Increase TRAC-BNT fee to 0.5% from 0.2%",
      "content": "### This proposal is expected to appear on Snapshot for voting on November 28, 2021 12:00 PM . Make sure to stake your vBNT for voting before this date and time to participate in the DAO decision.\n\n# TLDR\n\n* The TRAC-BNT pool is the deepest on all Ethereum DEXes by roughly 2x, currently at roughly $5m.\n* The current swap fee is 0.2%. An increase to 0.5% by 0.3% will most likely not impact volume as price impact is now lower than other DEXes.\n* The TRAC community is very interested in staking on Bancor and would greatly benefit from the increased APR.\n* An increased pool fee will also help siphon more profits from arbitrageurs.\n\nThe TRAC pool co-investment limit was recently increased [1]. The pool is currently full with roughly $5m in liquidity.\n\nThe TRAC/ETH pool on Uniswap v2 has a liquidity of US$559,800 (down from $679,352 when the co-investment limit increase was proposed), and the TRAC/ETH pool on Uniswap v3 has a liquidity of $474.12k (down from $579.85k when the co-investment limit increase was proposed).\n\nThis shows a tremendous commitment from the TRAC holders/community with staking on Bancor and benefiting from trading fees alongside single-sided staking and impermanent loss protection.\n\nAs the pool is now by far the deepest on DEXes, the community is proposing a change of the fee from 0.2% to 0.5%. This change should not impact volume significantly, as the price impact is considerably smaller on Bancor vs other DEXes.\n\nAs an example, a 5 ETH trade to TRAC on 1inch will route through Bancor and save 5% compared to Uniswap right now:\n\n![image|489x493, 70%](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/bancordao/original/2X/8/8227004bbd7c7317a001c421d13b95375a4273ed.jpeg)\nFigure 1 - 5ETH swap for TRAC routes through Bancor on 1inch.\n\nTrades with larger amounts will accrue very significant price impact on any exchange apart from Bancor. A trade from 50ETH to TRAC on 1inch that is routed through Bancor can be found on Figure 2.\n\n![image|345x500](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/bancordao/original/2X/5/59e180fcde10d0f00e61bbd274e539d6ebf00683.jpeg)\nFigure 2 - 50ETH swap for TRAC routes through Bancor on 1inch.\n\nThe TRAC-BNT pool volume has been increasing, and had some significant volume ($12m) on the week beginning 1st of November (Figure 3).\n\n![image|690x192](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/bancordao/original/2X/5/51f5028fd9fc3b952297d0addc5c0ab1b9d0c0bd.png)\nFigure 3 - Weekly Volume for the TRAC-BNT pool.\n\n![image|690x191](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/bancordao/original/2X/5/560e10266c8d2c9ce6864b9c56e646425170248c.png)\nFigure 4 - Weekly Fees for the TRAC-BNT pool.\n\n![image|690x393](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/bancordao/original/2X/3/3fa05784f671c48c33e36cf10beaad67de8a867a.jpeg)\nFigure 5 - Weekly Volume and Fees for the TRAC-BNT pool.\n\nAs @glenn mentioned before on the co-investment increase proposal [1]:\n\n> If this becomes the deepest pool on DEXes by a large margin (once it fills up) then we should consider raising the fees on this pool to .5%. This would lead to more profit for LPs and less for arbitrageurs. We have had great success with other pools like $AMP, $wNXM, and $ARCONA (to name a few) where we have attracted the most liquidity and can therefore set a higher fee on the pool (since we have no competition from other DEXes).\n\n\n[1] https://gov.bancor.network/t/proposal-increase-co-investment-limit-to-500k-bnt-on-trac-origintrail-pool/3123\n[2] https://v2.info.uniswap.org/pair/0x1a58aa618df8f1ec282748fef6185c1a1cc2faa6\n[3] https://info.uniswap.org/#/pools/0xb1914469141ebb6e244e75cee3f35d43bf6b85e5",

They would like to continue to use the Bancor pool in connection with its Saas licensing fee proxy eRSDL open market purchase program, and LM would allow increased TVL and decreased slippage.\n* The eRSDL open market purchase program corresponds to the use of digital markets, denominated in eRSDL, used to record the licensing subscription of our software by various operating entities. Purchasing of eRSDL out of the market will be done at regular intervals coinciding with the level of borrowing across our products. Terms may vary.\n* UnfederalReserve has listed Bancor as a place to swap BNT on https://unfederalreserve.com/.

Make sure to stake your vBNT for voting before this date and time to participate in the DAO decision.\n\n**To pass, this proposal requires 35% quorum and 66.7% supermajority on the Bancor DAO Snapshot.**\n\n# TLDR\n\n* This proposal seeks to increase the Co-investment limit from **100k BNT** to **200k BNT** for the RNB/BNT pool.\n* A larger RNB/BNT pool will reduce price impact and therefore attract more trades from retail users, aggregators, and professional market makers to Bancor.\n\n# Rationale\n\nThere’s currently space for 23,053 RNB ($42,186.99) in the pool. The Uniswap v2 RNB-ETH pool has a liquidity of $1,417,443 [1], and the RNB-BNT pool on Bancor has a liquidity of $905,921.\n\nThe current co-investment limit is 100k BNT. If we increase this limit to 200k BNT, that would allow for at least an extra $400,000 worth of RNB to be staked single-sided. This would allows us to have the deepest RNB pool on Ethereum and attract more volume to Bancor.\n\n# Abstract\n\nThere are currently **~111k BNT** and **~245K RNB** tokens in the BNT-RNB [pool](https://etherscan.io/address/0x4625cf0ad5688ecb8b87a3edac0c2065a5bea85f).

      "content": "### This proposal is expected to appear on Snapshot for voting on November 21, 2021 4:00 AM .\n\n## TLDR;\n\n* This proposal seeks to Whitelist the PSP Token.\n* There are no apparent security concerns.\n* There are no Reasons to doubt the legitimacy of the project/team.\n* Co-Investment of 100,000 BNT.\n* ParaSwap routes trades to Bancor so we should see a lot of the volume flow through bancor naturally.\n\nContract Address: 0xcafe001067cdef266afb7eb5a286dcfd277f3de5\n\nProject Website: Paraswap.io\n\n## Projects\n\nParaSwap aggregates decentralized exchanges and other DeFi services in one comprehensive interface to streamline and facilitate users' interactions with Ethereum's decentralized finance.\n\n“The arrival of the PSP token marks a new milestone in the project development. Indeed, a new set of actors — PSP holders/governance participants — are joining the ballet already made of the ParaSwap team, the market makers & various services ParaSwap integrates with or integrating it. So how does this work in the long-run?\n\nAs stated, with PSP our goal is to maximize the decentralization and resiliency of ParaSwap. This will require a decentralized infrastructure able to support the pathing computation necessary for ParaSwap to function in a timely manner.\n\nIndeed, for a swap on any given pair, ParaSwap computes all/most potential routes to find the perfect mix leading to the best outcome (= best price). Yet, this path-finding process is very time sensitive: Ethereum produces a new block every 15s on average, and each new block can bring changes to prices, therefore changing the optimal route. Thus, the computation for the route optimization has to be done offchain currently to provide a satisfying user experience.\n\nSolving this challenge is a mission both for the team and the DAO: while a technical solution is required, and the team is already working on it, we know that implementing such a solution will require a network of peers providing the computing power required for the pathing computation. This is where the DAO comes into play!”\n\n![|624x351](upload://yeu7kEDCIDxzNXQoNrB4zXPuah2.png)\n\nParaswap Boasts a huge amount of Volume, with part of it being routed through Bancor when it is more profitable for the trader.

PSP tokens holders can stake on market makers to add weight to their rewards, pushing the market market to deliver more competitive rates. At the end of each epoch (14days) the rewards are splitted between market makers and stakers. The estimated APY is visible directly in the application and auto compounding with each epoch. Investors’ tokens are subject to a vesting with a minimum period of two years (+4 months lockup) and up to three and a half years for team members (+6 months lockup). Here is the token unlocking schedule:\n\n![|624x323](upload://l9L7QehzKtl55LQyngwQIL2lsI2.png)\n\n## Co-Investment Reasoning\n\nThe Initial Co-Investment is to see whether we can get a sufficient amount of liquidity to fill it before we commit to anything bigger. The Uniswap Pools are about 10 Times larger than the one proposed in this Proposal but once we can prove the space can be filled I believe we should consider upping the BNT Co-Investment to match the Uniswap Pool. There might however be some friction since the native single sided rates on Paraswap are very competitive so I'd like to see the pool fill before we consider upping it.\n\n## Price & Stats\n\n## PSP Price and Market Stats\n\n|PSP Price|$1.13|\n| --- | --- |\n|Market Cap|$96,044,150|\n|Market Cap Dominance|0.00%|\n|Trading Volume|$20,628,427|\n|Volume / Market Cap|0.1532|\n\n## Community and Communication\n\n* https://twitter.com/paraswap\n* https://t.me/paraswap\n\n## Voting\n\nFOR - Approve Whitelisting + Co-Investment\n\nAGAINST - Do Nothing",

      "title": "Proposal: Whitelist ENS with 50k BNT co-investment",
      "content": "\n# TL;DR\n\n* Proposal to whitelist ENS.\n* Co-investment of 50,000 BNT.\n* There are no security concerns that could prohibit whitelist status.\n* There is no reason to doubt the legitimacy of the Ethereum Name Service project. The project is a Blockchain household name and has received support from the Ethereum Foundation, Binance X, Chainlink, Ethereum Classic Labs, and Protocol Labs.\n* The token was launched on the 8th of November of 2021 and therefore poses an impermanent loss protection risk as volatility is expected to be higher than other established tokens. \n* The benefit to Bancor is clear. Providing ENS liquidity will attract token LPs from the Ethereum Name Service community to swap on Bancor, and increase protocol trade volume. \n* The ENS token has been trending, ranking 13th on Coinmarketcap by volume from the top 200 tokens by Market Capitalization. Driving this volume to Bancor is definitely beneficial for a small IL risk from the 50k BNT co-investment.\n\n### Token Address: [0xc18360217d8f7ab5e7c516566761ea12ce7f9d72](https://etherscan.io/address/0xc18360217d8f7ab5e7c516566761ea12ce7f9d72)\n### Project Website: [Ethereum Name Service](https://ens.domains/)\n\n# Liquidity\n\nThe Deepest ENS pools are:\n\nThe ENS/ETH 1% Uniswap v3 pool with $29.57m liquidity, $62.93m daily volume, and an extrapolated APR from the 24hr fees of 7.78% [1].\n\nThe ENS/ETH 0.3% Uniswap v3 pool with $20.26m liquidity, $176.22m daily volume, and an extrapolated APR from the 24hr fees of 9.52% [2].\n\nThe WETH-ENS SushiSwap pool with $6,541,206.18 liquidity, $65,574,864.51 daily volume, and an extrapolated APR from the 24hr fees of 10.97% [3].\n\nA co-investment of 50,000BNT opens up space for at least $471k of liquidity in the pool, with BNT at $4.71.\n\n# Token Security\n\nENS does not have an elastic supply, or rebase mechanism. The ENS token has a max supply cap of 100,000,000 ENS. Contracts are standard ERC-20 OpenZeppelin contracts, with the addition of voting capabilities and other customisations detailed below. The contracts don’t have any permissions that grant administrators unrestricted mint/burn capabilities. From the contract:\n\n> @dev An ERC20 token for ENS.\n> Besides the addition of voting capabilities, we make a couple of customisations:\n> * Airdrop claim functionality via `claimTokens`. At creation time the tokens that\n> * Should be available for the airdrop are transferred to the token contract address;\n> * Airdrop claims are made from this balance.\n> * Support for the owner (the DAO) to mint new tokens, at up to 2% PA.\n\nThe top 15 contract and addresses with the highest concentration of ENS are the token, token lock and timelock contracts, Binance, OKEx, Uniswap pools, team wallets, FTT, KuCoin and 3 wallets with 0.1240%, 0.1115% and 0.1092% of supply.\n\n![image|690x423](upload://yJergJvujnOpIM1qZ5excXtv66t.png)\nFigure 1 - Top 15 contract and address with the highest concentration of ENS [4]\n\n# Project\n\nThe Ethereum Name Service (ENS) is a distributed, open, and extensible naming system based on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nENS’s job is to map human-readable names like ‘alice.eth’ to machine-readable identifiers such as Ethereum addresses, other cryptocurrency addresses, content hashes, and metadata. ENS also supports ‘reverse resolution’, making it possible to associate metadata such as canonical names or interface descriptions with Ethereum addresses.\n\nENS has similar goals to DNS, the Internet’s Domain Name Service, but has significantly different architecture due to the capabilities and constraints provided by the Ethereum blockchain. Like DNS, ENS operates on a system of dot-separated hierarchical names called domains, with the owner of a domain having full control over subdomains.\n\n# Tokenomics\n\nThe ENS is the governance token of the Ethereum Name Service project.\n\nThe core components of ENS are decentralized and self-running (e.g., no one can take away another person’s .ETH name), but there are a few things that require some human discretion.\n\nIn its first act as a DAO, $ENS token holders will vote to formally request from the ENS root keyholders the ability to:\n\n* Govern protocol parameters, like pricing, the price oracle, and more\n* Control funds from the existing community treasury, as well as receive future revenue.\n\nMore information on the ENS airdrop can be found [here](https://ens.mirror.xyz/5cGl-Y37aTxtokdWk21qlULmE1aSM_NuX9fstbOPoWU).\n\n# Community and Communication\n\nEthereum Name Service is active on [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/AskZbFx). The Ethereum Name Service team also operates official [Twitter ](https://twitter.com/ensdomains), [Mirror](https://ens.mirror.xyz/) accounts. \n\n",

We should not increase the co-investment limit on the pool or lower its fees\n\n**Abstract**\nThere are currently **~329.4K $BNT** and **~26.3K $RPL** tokens in the BNT-RPL [pool](https://etherscan.io/address/0x22e57d3BAb0CEf2872409EfBbe4C85A837B2fafF). This has resulted in a pool that has roughly **~2.9M** in liquidity. At the moment, LPs on the TKN side (**$RPL**) can’t provide single-sided liquidity since there is no capacity. This proposal seeks to increase the **$RPL** pool's single-sided capacity by increasing the Co-investment limit to **1M $BNT**.\n\n![image|481x314](upload://lpnJIujkEQ6RjitCqRYwDiw7fD4.png)\n\n**Motivation**\n\nIf we want to attract more RPL LPs to Bancor, we need to open up space in the pool so that they can provide single-sided liquidity. This would allow us to grow the liquidity in the pool and attract larger trades towards our platform which ultimately results in higher fees for Bancor. \n\nThe top pool for RPL is on Uniswap V3 and it is paired with ETH. Pool depth is roughly **~37M** and we should try to build up liquidity for this token since it has attracted a lot of attention recently (it recently launched on mainnet):\n\n![image|419x500](upload://m97q2MPYAxxVKKKWy1Zb0XDuuuS.png)\n\nThere is also a decent size pool on Uniswap V2 (the one we should compete with):\n\n![image|413x500](upload://9KvSazX2pzxUcUsMB9dnvq0Yqax.jpeg)\n\nNote that both of these pools have a fee of **.3%** with a large amount of liquidity than what we have. Our pool is not capable of competing with either pool at our current fee (.5%) and I am also requesting that the fee be set to .2% for this specific reason.\n\nCurrently, the Bancor pool has no space available and LPs can’t provide single-sided liquidity on the TKN side ($RPL). I am proposing a **1M** Co-investment limit for the $RPL pool which should open up roughly **$3M** in additional single-sided liquidity (assuming BNT price at $4.00). If this pool fills up completely, we would have a pool that’s roughly **~8M** in depth and be more competitive with the Uniswap V3/V2 pools.\n",

      "title": "Proposal: Increase Bancor's Bug Bounty Payout on Immunefi",
      "content": "### This proposal is expected to appear on Snapshot for voting on [date=2021-11-14 time=12:00:00 timezone=\"UTC\"]. Make sure to stake your vBNT for voting before this date and time to participate in the DAO decision.\n\n**Summary** :\n\nThis proposal is seeking to increase the payout for the following [vulnerabilities:](https://immunefi.com/bounty/bancor/)\n \n**critical** level vulnerabilities from the current $100K to $250K (plus an additional $50K from armor alliance, $250K is covered by us)\n**high** level vulnerabilities from the current $12K to $50K\n**medium** level vulnerabilities from the current $4K to $10K\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nOur current bug bounty payout is severely lagging behind our competitors and we should increase our bounties in order to be more in line with other DeFi protocols. The Bancor protocol currently holds over 1B+ in assets (half of which is protocol-owned $BNT). Increasing our bug bounty should inspire more confidence from our users and potentially drive more deposits into the protocol. More importantly, a higher bounty should attract white hat hackers that could potentially alert us to any vulnerabilities before they get exploited by malicious actors.\n\nThe current language for the Bancor bounty on [immunefi](https://immunefi.com/bounty/bancor/) is the following:\n\n> Payouts for Low to High bug reports as well as the first **USD 50 000** of Critical bug reports are handled by the **Bancor** core devs directly and are denominated in USD. However, payouts are done in **BNT** . For Critical bug reports, the remaining USD 50 000 is paid by ArmorFi under the **Armor Alliance Bug Bounty Challenge** in **ARMOR** with a vesting period of up to 24 months.\n\nas compared to the [Sushiswap language](https://immunefi.com/bounty/sushiswap/) which is the following:\n\n> Payouts are handled by the **SushiSwap** team directly and are denominated in **USD** . Payouts worth USD $100,000 and below are done in **USDC** . Payouts beyond USD $100,000 up to USD 1,000,000 are made in **SUSHI** , though the first $100,000 can be made in **USDC** if requested. Payouts above USD 1,000,000 have the remainder paid in **ARMOR** under the Armor Alliance Bug Bounty Challenge with a vesting period of up to 24 months.\n\nI am proposing the following revised changes:\n\n> Payouts are handled by the **Bancor** core devs directly and are denominated in **USD** . Payouts worth USD $100,000 and below are done in **USDC, USDT, or DAI**. Payouts beyond USD $100,000 up to USD $250,000 are made in **BNT**, though the first $100,000 can be made in **USDC, USDT, or DAI** if requested. For Critical bug reports, an additional USD $50,000 is paid by ArmorFi under the **Armor Alliance Bug Bounty Challenge** in **ARMOR** with a vesting period of up to 24 months.\n\n**Motivation:**\n\nThe recent high-profile exploits on other DeFi protocols have definitely put more focus on security across several DeFi protocols. While looking at our vulnerabilities I noticed that we were on the low end as compared to our peers. Below is a comparison between us and sushiswap to get a sense of how far behind we are:\n\n![image|681x500](upload://iIqnsYOQAumiiMcA4J1CGa7ErIP.png)\nSushiswap: https://immunefi.com/bounty/sushiswap/\n\nWe can also see that Aave has implemented a $250K bounty for severe vulnerabilities that are almost certain to be exploitable:\n\n![image|690x390](upload://mR26VXXkusDkW0DoUuNVR7bwlSE.png)\nAave: https://aave.com/bug-bounty/\n\nCurve follows a similar approach with a payout of $250K for high vulnerabilities that are almost certain to be exploitable:\n\nUniswap have a payout of up to $500K for any vulnerability that leads to the loss of LP funds:\n\nBalancer takes this a step higher by offering $2M for critical severity vulnerabilities\n**For:**\n\nIncrease the payout on the following vulnerabilities:\n \n> **critical** level vulnerabilities from the current $100K to $250K (plus an additional $50K from armor alliance, 250K is covered by us)\n> **high** level vulnerabilities from the current $12K to $50K\n> **medium** level vulnerabilities from the current $4K to $10K\n\nand update the language to the following:\n\n> Payouts are handled by the **Bancor** core devs directly and are denominated in **USD** . Payouts worth USD $100,000 and below are done in **USDC, USDT, or DAI**. Payouts beyond USD $100,000 up to USD $250,000 are made in **BNT**, though the first $100,000 can be made in **USDC, USDT, or DAI** if requested. For Critical bug reports, an additional USD $50,000 is paid by ArmorFi under the **Armor Alliance Bug Bounty Challenge** in **ARMOR** with a vesting period of up to 24 months.\n\n**Against:**\n\nDo not change the payout on any of the vulnerabilities\n",

      "title": "Proposal: Whitelist Sator Token (SAO)",
      "content": "**TL;DR**\n\n• Proposal to whitelist Sator token\n\n• Sator is a social utility token powering our next generation content engagement metaverse\n\n• There are no apparent security concerns that would prohibit whitelist status\n\n• Proposing 100K BNT Co-Investment.\n\nSAO token address:\n\nSolana\n\n2HeykdKjzHKGm2LKHw8pDYwjKPiFEoXAz74dirhUgQvq\n\nEthereum\n\nhttps://etherscan.io/address/0x3ef389f264e07fff3106a3926f2a166d1393086f\n\nProject Website: **https://sator.io**\n\n**Sator**\n\nSator is a decentralized application designed to scale and expand linear content (Television, Film, Music, Streamers) to a more immersive content engagement experience. Audiences are incentivized by social utility token rewards (SAO) and content-based NFTs in the Sator dApp marketplace. Content creators, producers, and content rights holders simultaneously grow audience and global reach. Sator Network (SAO) runs on Ethereum and Solana, utilizing Wormhole bridge for bidirectional transfers and cross-chain interoperability. Sator contributes to the ecosystem as a whole by pioneering NFT utility in traditional media/television/film/music content and by incentivizing centralized rights holders to diffuse value throughout the ecosystem.\n\nSator addresses the greatest pain points in content: viewership growth, viewer engagement, subscribership growth & retention. Plus, Sator is the first mechanism to align the interests of content viewers and distributors by rewarding them both for their respective contributions. Sator also pushes NFT innovation ahead by embedding show-specific NFTs with extremely unique utility, profile-display features, and experiential relevance. Sator is building a content engagement metaverse — the Satorverse.\n\n**Sator Team?**\n\nSator’s world-class team of 20+ includes top engineering talent, designers, marketers, to name a few.\n\nSator Founders met at Consensus 2017 and immediately bonded over the future of blockchain. In the years that followed, ideas and research were shared. A group of television producers asked the Sator Founders “how blockchain can help grow and retain viewership” and that catalyzed early thinking about how Sator unlocks potential at the intersection of content and crypto.\n\n**Sator Future Plan?**\n\nSator beta is still going on for about 1 more week if you’d like to practice earning and using testnet tokens. Plus, all beta users will receive an airdrop as Thank You upon the conclusion of beta/launch of mainnet. Sator mainnet dApp launches around 11/7. Mainnet launch onward, Sator users earn crypto for engaging with content. Major TV, film, and music partnerships announce — a handful in Nov, then dozens in January.\n\n**Tokenomics**\n\nSator’s native token, SAO is built on Solana with a bi-directional bridge to Ethereum (Wrapped ERC20) through Wormhole bridge. Users engage and earn $SAO in our decentralized application, which is directly supported by SAO token.\n\nThe SAO token has a total supply of 500,000,000 tokens. Our initial circulating supply will be less than 4% of those tokens, approximately 20 million SAO. We will not burn tokens.\n\n![Pasted Graphic.png](blob:https://gov.bancor.network/542d2d0c-37f2-47ec-9215-7e5486eff9c7)\n\nTokens will also be distributed in a fair method, without the risk of whales dumping them on the new line of investors. Investors and team stay locked for 1 year before incremental monthly unlocks, making it impossible for investors and VCs to dump the token.\n\nThe owners and the team will only receive less than 13% of the whole token distribution, and their tokens will be freed up in a fair and calculatable structure over 4 years time, with no option to sell in the first 11 months.\n\n**Community**\n\nSator is currently in the middle of the whitelisting process on DexLab, with lots of support from our community. Sator’s GenShards NFT offering has also completely sold out as of last week. Sator plans to list on Uniswap on 11/7, Gate on 11/7, and Bancor shortly thereafter.\n\n**Coinvestment**\n\nAs SAO is a very new token, we propose to start with 100K BNT Co-investment and will grow this when demand is met.\n\n**Benefits for Bancor**\n\nSator’s mission and vision and both are very much in line with Bancor’s core values. DAO governance and decentralization, presenting a truly decentralized solution for as large a community as possible is just the start. Most important benefit for Bancor will be volume, as that is essentially what drives the fees that allow for Impermanent loss protection. Sator plans for Bancor to be our deepest pool on Ethereum and as a result we expect to get the most volume here.\n\nWe are confident that we can deliver value to Bancor’s users by introducing a token that will be successful thanks to our distribution, value centric tokenomics, and many use cases that SAO token will be supporting.\n",

      "title": "Proposal: Extend Liquidity Mining Rewards for WBTC, LINK and ETH pools",
      "content": "### This proposal is expected to appear on Snapshot for voting on [date=2021-11-14 time=12:00:00 timezone=\"Europe/Lisbon\"] . Make sure to stake your vBNT for voting before this date and time to participate in the DAO decision.\n\n\nThe LM rewards schedule for ETH, LINK, WBTC is due to end in less than 2 weeks. To maintain liquidity in the near term, and to sustain liquidity while Bancor prepares new products and upgrades, wherein it is proposed to extend the LM rewards program on these pools for a further 12 weeks with conditions to stop if the V3 is released.\n\n1. ETH, LINK, and WBTC will continue to receive emissions of 100-200K BNT per week, for an additional 12 weeks.\n2. Upon release of the V3, a new LM incentives program may be considered by the DAO. Therefore the current liquidity mining plan will be stopped to incentivise migration.\n\n# Discussion\n\n1. Around 75% of tokens have been restaked back into the pools; therefore, the LM rewards have increased the space for single-sided TKN deposits, resulting in growth of the network, rather than creating a sell pressure.\n2. The above 3 pools hold the majority of the protocol TVL, therefore curation of these pools is essential to maintain the position of the Bancor protocol on the market.\n3. The 3 mentioned above pools drive most of the volume on the ecosystem, and also present reasonable impermanent loss liability.\n4. The pools should be curated until the new V3 design is released so the funds are migrated without loss of significant TVL prior the protocol upgrade\n\n# Summary\n\n1. At this stage, current protocol growth requires LM to maintain the momentum and stay competitive in the space (the DAO seems aware of this).\n2. After releasing the V3 and supporting the smooth liquidity migration, LM extension will no longer be necessary, and the voting for LM extensions may be concluded.\n3. A large majority of the LM rewards are re-staked to the protocol, increasing the TVL and the space available for TKN deposits with single sided exposure. If this trend continues, the LM program is more of an asset than a liability, and can be managed more assertively.\n4. In the long term, Bancor is aiming towards sustainable annual inflation of 4%, in order to achieve that, Bancor requires significant volume and Vortex to be applied.\n5. **Extension of LM rewards on ETH, WBTC and LINK for 12 weeks will provide 1,200,000 - 2,400,000 BNTs as rewards, (depends on the multiplier).\n\nThis proposal is very similar to the one here: https://gov.bancor.network/t/proposal-extend-liquidity-mining-for-btc-eth-link/2756. The arguments in favour of LM extension for the large caps pools then are still valid for a recent LM extension.",

      "content": "### This proposal is expected to appear on Snapshot for voting on [date=2021-11-14 time=12:00:00 timezone=\"UTC\"]. Make sure to stake your vBNT for voting before this date and time to participate in the DAO decision.\n\n**TLDR**\n\n* This proposal seeks to increase the Co-investment limit to 1M BNT for the **$QNT** pool from the current 500K $BNT co-investment.\n* It will open up space for LPs on the TKN side (**$QNT**) and increase the depth of the pool as LPs add liquidity\n* A larger **$QNT** pool will attract more trades from aggregators and professional market makers to Bancor which ultimately leads to more fees for our platform.\n\n**For**\n\n1. A larger co-investment limit on the pool will let LPs provide single-sided liquidity and will lead to an increase in pool depth\n2. More liquidity in the **QNT-BNT** pool should lead to larger volume from DEX aggregators and professional market makers sent in our direction\n3. More volume for Bancor leads to more fees for our platform and **$BNT** holders\n\n**Against**\n\n1. We should not increase the limit on the pool.\n\n**Abstract**\nThere are currently **~627.5K $BNT** and **~10.7K $QNT** tokens in the BNT-QNT [pool](https://etherscan.io/address/0x11A9FE753fEe7f8Fd02eFef1a32e81217098D3D0). This has resulted in a pool that has roughly **~5.5M** in liquidity. At the moment, LPs on the TKN side (**$QNT**) can’t provide single-sided liquidity since there is no capacity. This proposal seeks to increase the **$QNT** pool's single-sided capacity by increasing the Co-investment limit to **1M $BNT**.\n\n![image|475x301](upload://qTi5aSWWwVLvlsu2IXLjgBnBteZ.png)\n\n**Motivation**\n\nIf we want to attract more QNT LPs to Bancor, we need to open up space in the pool so that they can provide single-sided liquidity. This would allow us to grow the liquidity in the pool and attract larger trades towards our platform which ultimately results in higher fees for Bancor. \n\nThe top pool for QNT is on Uniswap V3 and it is paired with ETH. Pool depth is roughly **~5.44M** and we should be able to make the Bancor pool deeper to support larger trades with low price impact:\n\n![image|451x500](upload://ia27zOzccVM1Icn1wFgtvatkSiJ.png)\n\nCurrently, the Bancor pool has no space available and LPs can’t provide single-sided liquidity on the TKN side (QNT). I am proposing a **1M** Co-investment limit for the QNT pool which should open up roughly **$2M** in additional single-sided liquidity (assuming BNT price at $4.00). If this pool fills up completely, we would have a pool that’s roughly **~10M** in depth and be more competitive with the Uniswap V3 pool.\n",

Make sure to stake your vBNT for voting before this date and time to participate in the DAO decision.\n\nThe original thread where the fees were lowered (from **.5%** to **.1%**) is here:\n\nhttps://gov.bancor.network/t/proposal-lower-mkr-bnt-fees-to-0-1/2438\n\nthis happened towards the end of June and the fee change went into effect a few weeks later. A quick look at volume and fees doesn't suggest that much changed after the lower fees (from .5% to .1%) went into effect:\n\n![image|690x186](upload://n1hiKWmBWii2AlppQ2rUEYuOPiR.png)\n\nvolumes seem to have actually gone down from three months prior (but this isn't a good comparison in my opinion). Note that April was when LM went active on this pool and the month that followed (May) was a month when DeFi volume was up across the board.\n\n![image|690x175](upload://2chzUzY9ykSrO7EOueh4xRT6R16.png)\n\nWe did have a few days towards the end of May and July when crypto markets took a tumble and BTC went down to $30K levels. \n\nThe weekly fees or this pool have hovered between 2K-4K after the change. Lower fees could also be due to a loss of liquidity in this pool after LM ended (I think it was double of current levels, around ~20m):\n\n![image|474x296](upload://859dqBrWhp5HZGbRgPLyopnp9kZ.png)\n\nI am proposing that we raise the pool fees to .2% to see if this will affect weekly fees generated by this pool:\n\n![image|690x188](upload://3l9Jfv7uwAWQRvU4tYNIXFwgHgU.png)\n\nI don't expect the liquidity in this pool to decrease since it has been at these levels for a few months and this should give us some useful data on whether a .2% fee will make it more profitable for LPs.\n",

      "content": "### This proposal is expected to appear on Snapshot for voting on [date=2021-11-14 time=12:00:00 timezone=\"UTC\"]. Make sure to stake your vBNT for voting before this date and time to participate in the DAO decision.\n\n**TLDR**\n\n* This proposal seeks to increase the Co-investment limit to **1M $BNT** for the **$MANA** pool.\n* It also seeks to increase the pool fees from **.1%** to **.2%** to be at the same level as the Uniswap (V2 & V3) and sushiswap pools\n* It will open up space for LPs on the TKN side (**$MANA**) and increase the depth of the pool as LPs add liquidity\n* A larger **$MANA** pool will attract more trades from aggregators and professional market makers to Bancor which ultimately leads to more fees for our platform.\n\n**For**\n\n1. A larger co-investment limit on the pool will let LPs provide single-sided liquidity and will lead to an increase in pool depth\n2. A higher fee will put this pool at the same level as uniswap (V2 & V3) and sushiswap while at the same time letting LPs earn more\n2. More liquidity in the **MANA-BNT** pool should lead to larger volume from DEX aggregators and professional market makers sent in our direction\n3. More volume for Bancor leads to more fees for our platform and **$BNT** holders\n\n**Against**\n\n1. We should not increase the co-investment limit on the pool or raise its fees\n\n**Abstract**\n\nThe first attempt for a co-investment increase on the MANA pool is here:\n\nhttps://gov.bancor.network/t/proposal-increase-co-investment-limit-to-500k-bnt-on-mana-decentraland-pool/1825\n\nThe proposal never made it to snapshot because the pool wasn't upgraded to a version that would allow for a portition of its fees to go towards the vortex. This is no longer the case and the pool has now been upgraded to support the vortex.\n\nThere are currently **~229K $BNT** and **~295K $MANA** tokens in the BNT-MANA [pool](https://etherscan.io/address/0xbe4B63Cbb413b5d1f71f06bA2309b3dD95712a61). This has resulted in a pool that has roughly **~2.1M** in liquidity. This proposal seeks to increase the **$MANA** pool's single-sided capacity by increasing the Co-investment limit to **1M $BNT**.\n\n![image|474x293](upload://lAyYYxYxKDHBZUUwJEOgW6EYF5G.png)\n\n**Motivation**\n\nIf we want to attract more MANA LPs to Bancor, we need to open up space in the pool so that they can provide single-sided liquidity. This would allow us to grow the liquidity in the pool and attract larger trades towards our platform which ultimately results in higher fees for Bancor. \n\nThe top pool for MANA is on Uniswap V2 and it is paired with ETH. Pool depth is roughly **9M** and we should try to build up liquidity for this token since it has attracted a lot of attention recently (game that incorporates NFTs):\n\n![image|469x499](upload://eWpY8TMJCY8VLbFrjSn9TAQYUgq.jpeg)\n\nThere is also a decent size pool on Sushiswap:\n\n![image|690x218](upload://5R2ycrk2g3nasT0As0qSMvPIUYf.png)\n\nNote that both of these pools have a fee of **.3%** and I am also requesting that the fee be set to **.2%** for this specific reason (a double hop swap from ETH-BNT and BNT-MANA has a cost of .3%).\n\nCurrently, the Bancor pool has no space available and LPs can’t provide single-sided liquidity on the TKN side ($MANA). I am proposing a **1M** Co-investment limit for the $MANA pool.\n",

This listed skyrocketed TRAC's trading volume and at the time of this writing TRAC is seeing approx **$115M** volume on it's Coinbase TRAC-USD pair alone.  This volume increase is somewhere in the range of a 40x-50x increase in volume since the **$TRAC-BNT** pool was originally created.  Since this listing there has been increased demand from the TRAC community for alternative sources of passive income and one of these demands is a larger limit for the **$TRAC-BNT** pool.  If we want to attract more TRAC LPs to Bancor, we need to open up space in the pool so that they can provide single-sided liquidity. This would allow us to grow the liquidity in the pool and attract larger trades towards our platform which ultimately results in higher fees for Bancor.  \n\nCurrently, the Bancor pool has no space available and LPs can’t provide single-sided liquidity.

At the current revenue level, this 100% will translate into approximately **$1m being used for the buyback every month.**\n* LM rewards will be considered if the KeeperDAO community is in favour of moving the buyback mechanism to Bancor.

The RAILGUN Privacy contracts do not have permissions that grant administrators unrestricted mint/burn capabilities. The RAIL token supply is fixed at 100,000,000 of which 50,000,000 are in current circulation. The contracts and address with the highest concentration of RAIL tokens are predominantly the token staking contract with 50% of the supply staked by community members\n\n\n# Project\n\nRAILGUN is a collection of smart contracts that verify zero-knowledge proofs, allowing users to make, send or receive transactions without revealing any assets, amounts, or identities. In much the same way, it also allows users to interact with smart contracts, such as those used for DEX trading, yield farming and other dApps (decentralised Apps). Layered on top of this on-chain system is a suite of adapters called Adapt Modules for existing applications on Ethereum that anyone can deploy.\n\n# RAIL Token, Voting & Distribution\n\nRAIL Token & Voting RAIL is the governance token of the RAILGUN DAO. One token (staked in the voting contract) equals one vote. Users who have not staked, or who are unstaking, will not be able to vote. Once the RAIL tokens are staked, the unstaking period is 30 days, thus there is an effective minimum time of 30 days to hold the token after a vote is cast. This means that voters have to look at least a month in advance when they choose how they vote for protocol upgrades or fees. There can be no “Vote Raiding” and voters will look beyond the next few days.\n\nThe distribution of the RAILGUN DAO governance token, RAIL, can be summarized as below:\n\n• 25% allocated to Airdrop\n\n• 25% allocated to the Foundation\n\n• 50% allocated to RAILGUN DAO\n\nTotal circulating token supply at launch will be 50 million RAIL tokens. Maximum lifetime total supply of the RAIL token would be 100 million tokens - creating more than 100 million is impossible.\n\nAirdrop tokens (25%): Ethereum addresses who have made donations on the ETH network to privacy charities and nonprofits, such as the TOR Project, the Right to Privacy Foundation, the Free Software Foundation and others, will be given an airdrop of RAIL tokens. \n\nFoundation tokens (25%): The Right to Privacy Foundation issued a grant to develop RAILGUN project and has volunteered to take custody of 25% of the RAIL tokens, in order to support the long-term benefit of the Project. The foundation is a registered charity and is not motivated by profit. These tokens will only be used for incentivizing developers and the promotion of the RAILGUN platform, including future deployments. The Foundation will not be a seller of tokens for the first DAO year.\n\n\n# Available Audits\n\nRAILGUN has been fully audited by ABDK, who are domain experts in cryptography and zero-knowledge proofs and is planned to be regularly audited as security is a top priority next to privacy. Current audits by Zokyo and Hacken are underway: For full details please click here (https://gov.bancor.network/t/2nd-vote-proposal-whitelist-railgun-rail-with-75k-co-investment/3150).\n\n\n# Market and Trading Data\n\n$RAIL price at the time of writing is $0.88\n\nAll-time high: $1.38 (Aug, 08, 2021)\n\nAll-time low: $0.31 (July 17, 2021)\n\nPrice 90 days ago: $0.77\n\n50,000,000 tokens in circulation\n\n100,000,000 maximum supply.\n\nThe current market capitalization is $44,630,040\n\nBenefits for Bancor:\nThe benefits to Bancor are far and wide. RAILGUN is essentially a privacy protocol that builds Rails to operate with platforms such as Bancor in a completely private way; allowing users to trade, & provide liquidity in complete privacy. With this whitelisting, Bancor could become the first major DEX to offer such a feature for its users, by working with RAILGUN. The goal is also to bring the deepest possible liquidity (deeper than Uniswap + Sushiswap) to Bancor, RAILGUN can offer Bancor as the premier solution to its $RAIL LP’s that want to stake single-sided, and be completely protected from IL, not found on any other DEX, bringing many RAIL LP’s to Bancor.\n",

It's a good chance to increase our market impact.** In just a 2 days, [the liquidity in the pool of the Bancor network exceeded $2.664M], [MCap increased x10 to 21.4M], and there are still a lot of people willing to contribute assets to the pool. This move helped strengthen the ARCONA token and expand our community.  ARCONA seems to be performing well now. ARCONA is now over 100% APY. There is no room in the pool for more ARCONA LPs. There is no active LM rewards on the ARCONA pool, and not everyone interesting add liquidity for second side(BNT) of ARCONABNT.\nTherefore, we propose to vote to increase the size of co-investment from 50 thousands BNT to 500 thousands BNT. The possibility of one-way staking encourages our token holders to use the Bancor protocol more actively and to increase the pool size. As liquidity deepens, so will the yield on swaps for LP.\nThe [Arcona XR Metaverse] team would like to thank everyone who voted to submit our project to Whitelist Bancor. \nhttps://imgur.com/hPTY79C.png\n\n[Arcona XR Metaverse]: <https://apps.apple.com/us/app/arcona-augmented-reality-world/id1483217647>\n[After Facebook announced of Meta with metaverse concept]: <https://about.fb.com/news/2021/10/facebook-company-is-now-meta/>\n[the liquidity in the pool of the Bancor network exceeded $2.664M]: <https://etherscan.io/address/0x0c898e4e13b73364648c20d9e3c7ddb3a2a6788e>\n[MCap increased x10 to 21.4M]: <https://etherscan.io/token/0x0f71b8de197a1c84d31de0f1fa7926c365f052b3>\n[0x0f71b8de197a1c84d31de0f1fa7926c365f052b3]: <https://etherscan.io/token/0x0f71b8de197a1c84d31de0f1fa7926c365f052b3>",

      "title": "Proposal: APW Open Market buyback In exchange for limited LM",
      "content": "**Expected on Snapshot on Nov 7**\n\n**TL;DR**\n\n* APWine (APW) has been recently whitelisted on Bancor and launched a [liquidity pool](https://app.bancor.network/eth/pool/add/0xBd106861ed0F145ee37993e2fD54056F18C08F77)\n* Now requesting 2500 BNT per week for 8 weeks to give enough liquidity for the buy back to make sense and in coordination with the upcoming v1 launch which will draw attention and demand to the APW token\n\n* If approved, APWine will direct additional liquidity and volume into the Bancor ecosystem and accelerate the benefits derived from the Bancor Vortex burner. This will be achieved by creating liquidity pairs for Future Yield tokens when Bancor v3 deploys.\n\n**Justification**\n\nAPWine is settling into the Bancor Ecosystem and aiming to facilitate the trading of unrealized yield across DeFi. The buyback program, through increased swap volume, increases the TVL within the Bancor ecosystem (by locking fees) and burns BNT (reduces the total BNT supply). As an added benefit, users are able to decrease their risk by borrowing against their staked BNT.\n\nThe APWine Team will soon deploy v1 of its protocol, creating demand for the APW token and is eagerly awaiting V3. During which, APWine is aiming to establish a deeply entrenched footprint within the Bancor Ecosystem. Our goal is to allow users to trade future yield on their Bancor LP position(s) through the custom APWine AMM.\n\nVote FOR: Start LM on APW/BNT pool at the amounts listed above in exchange for using the Bancor pool for APW buy backs\n\nVote AGAINST: make no change\n\nCheers!",

      "content": "### This proposal is expected to appear on Snapshot for voting on [date=2021-11-07 time=12:00:00 timezone=\"UTC\"]. Make sure to stake your vBNT for voting before this date and time to participate in the DAO decision.\n\n**Summary** :\n\nThis proposal is seeking to increase the payout for the following [vulnerabilities:](https://immunefi.com/bounty/bancor/)\n \n**critical** level vulnerabilities from the current $100K to $250K (plus an additional $50K from armor alliance, $250K is covered by us)\n**high** level vulnerabilities from the current $12K to $50K\n**medium** level vulnerabilities from the current $4K to $10K\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nOur current bug bounty payout is severely lagging behind our competitors and we should increase our bounties in order to be more in line with other DeFi protocols. The Bancor protocol currently holds over 1B+ in assets (half of which is protocol-owned $BNT). Increasing our bug bounty should inspire more confidence from our users and potentially drive more deposits into the protocol. More importantly, a higher bounty should attract white hat hackers that could potentially alert us to any vulnerabilities before they get exploited by malicious actors.\n\nThe current language for the Bancor bounty on [immunefi](https://immunefi.com/bounty/bancor/) is the following:\n\n> Payouts for Low to High bug reports as well as the first **USD 50 000** of Critical bug reports are handled by the **Bancor** core devs directly and are denominated in USD. However, payouts are done in **BNT** . For Critical bug reports, the remaining USD 50 000 is paid by ArmorFi under the **Armor Alliance Bug Bounty Challenge** in **ARMOR** with a vesting period of up to 24 months.\n\nas compared to the [Sushiswap language](https://immunefi.com/bounty/sushiswap/) which is the following:\n\n> Payouts are handled by the **SushiSwap** team directly and are denominated in **USD** . Payouts worth USD $100,000 and below are done in **USDC** . Payouts beyond USD $100,000 up to USD 1,000,000 are made in **SUSHI** , though the first $100,000 can be made in **USDC** if requested. Payouts above USD 1,000,000 have the remainder paid in **ARMOR** under the Armor Alliance Bug Bounty Challenge with a vesting period of up to 24 months.\n\nI am proposing the following revised changes:\n\n> Payouts are handled by the **Bancor** core devs directly and are denominated in **USD** . Payouts worth USD $100,000 and below are done in **USDC, USDT, or DAI**. Payouts beyond USD $100,000 up to USD $250,000 are made in **BNT**, though the first $100,000 can be made in **USDC, USDT, or DAI** if requested. For Critical bug reports, an additional USD $50,000 is paid by ArmorFi under the **Armor Alliance Bug Bounty Challenge** in **ARMOR** with a vesting period of up to 24 months.\n\n**Motivation:**\n\nBelow is a comparison between us and sushiswap to get a sense of how far behind we are:\n\n![image|681x500](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/bancordao/original/2X/8/832cba6ff43c1e2d8facaf157363dfabd0f9f4b7.png)\nSushiswap: https://immunefi.com/bounty/sushiswap/\n\nWe can also see that Aave has implemented a $250K bounty for severe vulnerabilities that are almost certain to be exploitable:\n\n![image|690x390](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/bancordao/original/2X/a/a02e8ad93349783939aebdcb933804519e3bd120.png)\nAave: https://aave.com/bug-bounty/\n\nCurve follows a similar approach with a payout of $250K for high vulnerabilities that are almost certain to be exploitable:\n\n![image|690x294](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/bancordao/original/2X/b/bd25488b34a2adb0053491d387a58f568a815e31.png)\nCurve: https://curve.fi/bugbounty\n\nOur friends at Uniswap have a payout of up to $500K for any vulnerability that leads to the loss of LP funds:\n\n![image|690x237](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/bancordao/original/2X/0/05348f61b8d6ce31111b26fb2105f504dcf0c857.png)\nUniswap: https://uniswap.org/bug-bounty/\n\nBalancer takes this a step higher by offering $2M for critical severity vulnerabilities:\n\n![image|532x500](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/bancordao/original/2X/e/ec81b1ce414abc123c0821bb6faef819bda6134a.png)\nBalancer: https://docs.balancer.fi/concepts/security/bug-bounties\n\n**For:**\n\nIncrease the payout on the following vulnerabilities:\n \n> **critical** level vulnerabilities from the current $100K to $250K (plus an additional $50K from armor alliance, 250K is covered by us)\n> **high** level vulnerabilities from the current $12K to $50K\n> **medium** level vulnerabilities from the current $4K to $10K\n\n**Against:**\n\nDo not change the payout on any of the vulnerabilities",

      "title": "Proposal: Increase Co-investment Limit to 2.1M BNT on the ROOK-BNT pool",
      "content": "### This proposal is expected to appear on Snapshot for voting on [date=2021-10-31 time=12:00:00 timezone=\"Europe/Lisbon\"]. Make sure to stake your vBNT for voting before this date and time to participate in the DAO decision.\n\n#### To pass, this proposal requires 40% quorum and 66.7% supermajority on the Bancor DAO\n#### Additionally, this proposal is contingent on the passing of the KeeperDAO proposal ( [Co-invest ROOK in Bancor ROOK-BNT Pool](https://forum.keeperdao.com/t/co-invest-rook-in-bancor-rook-bnt-pool/176)) to deposit a portion of their treasury in Bancor.\n\n# TLDR\n\n* This proposal seeks to increase the Co-investment limit from **1.6M BNT** to **2.1M BNT** for the ROOK/BNT pool.\n* KeeperDAO is looking to deposit a portion (**~6400 ROOK**) of their treasury on Bancor. Opening space in the pool will allow for these funds to be deposited on Bancor if KeeperDAO's proposal passes in their governance.\n* A larger ROOK/BNT pool will reduce price impact and therefore attract more trades from retail users, aggregators, and professional market makers to Bancor.\n\n# Rationale\n\n* The KeeperDAO team will start performing ROOK buybacks [1] [2]. At the current revenue level, this 100% will translate into approximately **$1m being used for the buyback every month.**\n* LM rewards will be considered if the KeeperDAO community is in favour of moving the buyback mechanism to Bancor. For now, it is essential to increase the space in the pool to allow for more liquidity and consequentially drive more ROOK volume to Bancor.\n* The space in the pool isn’t full yet but incentivising it is definitely worth it.\n\n# Abstract\nThere is currently **~1.3M BNT** and **~22K ROOK** tokens in the BNT-ROOK [pool](https://etherscan.io/address/0xFa7b9AD60304119f59B172Ef78B98D50cb9A5c98). This has resulted in a pool that has roughly **~11.2M** in liquidity. At the moment, we won't be able to support the ROOK treasury and they won't be able to provide single-sided liquidity since there is not enough capacity. This proposal is seeking to increase single-sided capacity in the ROOK pool by increasing the Co-investment limit to **2.1M BNT** .\n\n![image|482x295](upload://bkQX8KXjr80Ol9yjofmU5jXUaTd.png)\n\n\n# For\n\nIncrease pool co-investment from **1.6M BNT** to **2.1M BNT**.\n\nNote: This proposal is contingent on the passing of the KeeperDAO proposal [Co-invest ROOK in Bancor ROOK-BNT Pool](https://forum.keeperdao.com/t/co-invest-rook-in-bancor-rook-bnt-pool/176) to deposit a portion of their treasury in Bancor.\n\n# Against\n\nKeep the pool co-investment at 1.6M BNT.\n\n[1] https://forum.keeperdao.com/t/kip-4-buy-back-and-burn-100-of-ninjas-new-revenue-initiative/117\n[2] https://snapshot.org/#/rook.eth/proposal/Qmd7bLee9HB9nftay99girdf61CEimMo2U2tY1QVJ6hBFM\n",

Request currently supports Ethereum & ERC20s, Polygon, Celo, Fantom, and Near payment networks. \nThe protocol's most successful app allows businesses to pay & get paid in cryptocurrencies, whatever the payment networks. \nIn the last 6 months, Request went from >$1M to >$100M of crypto invoices paid through Request App, by +750 actors including Maker, Aave, Near, Ocean, and The Sandbox.\n\n# Token Security\n\nREQ does not have an elastic supply or rebase mechanism. The Request Network contracts do not have permissions that grant administrators unrestricted mint/burn capabilities. The REQ token supply is fixed at 1,000,000,000, of which 999,881,815 are in current circulation. The contracts and addresses with the highest concentration of REQ tokens are predominantly the Binance, Coinbase, Huobi and Kucoin wallets, and the Swiss-based Request Network Foundation’s wallets.\n\n![|602x240](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/bancordao/optimized/2X/9/972f3298f287605ecccb204f5672af5736bb0203_2_1204x480.png)\n\n# Project\n\nThe Request Network project is a blockchain payment request technology. Request Network is a decentralized payment request network, aiming to replace thousands of old school payment request databases. As with any decentralized system, Request Network is nearly impossible to compromise, as the adversary must control the majority of the network to influence its behavior. Therefore, Request Network offers a trustless payment reputation. Due to the general nature of financial databases, and the already well-established and rapidly growing need for state-of-the-art security, Request Network serves a clear purpose now and in the future. The Request Network blog features a detailed list with examples of payment networks it connects with, such as Ethereum, Polygon, Near, Fantom, and Fuse.\n\n# Tokenomics\n\nRequest Network’s native token, REQ (ERC20) is an Ethereum token that powers the Request Network, a protocol for creating and requesting payments. Transactions on Request Network are immutably recorded and requests are processed without an intermediary.\n\nREQ is required to vote in the project’s off-chain governance and serves as an anti-spam mechanism for payment requests, thanks to its burning function at each payment request creation. Therefore, the REQ token is a utility token and not merely a symbolic representation of the project. Coinbase and Binance are reputable centralized exchanges with helpful blog entries that discuss the project: https://research.binance.com/en/projects/request-network and https://www.coinbase.com/price/request\n\n# Available Audits\n\nRequest Network has been audited at least four times since 2017, by reputable auditors:\n\n* [Quantstamp ](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1rmDvEdmOGmxqU8e8iAfF96YgUc38heh3/view?usp=sharing)(Oct 2017)\n* [Verichains ](https://github.com/verichains/public-audit-reports/blob/main/Verichains%20Public%20Audit%20Report%20-%20Request%20Network%20-%20v1.0.pdf)(Mar 2018)\n* [Clement Lesaege](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1EdDfEg8PQ79fkDr70ey33kIYFqixFOaA/view?usp=sharing) (Sep 2019)\n* [Cur53 ](https://request.network/en/2020/07/07/request-encryption-audit-completed-by-cure53/)(Jul 2020)\n* Request Network also opened a [bug bounty program](https://blog.request.network/request-network-bug-bounty-live-ee3297e46695).\n\nBenefits for Bancor:\n\nBenefits for Bancor are clear. At the time of writing, Coinbase estimates the popularity of REQ at #83. Popularity is based on the relative market cap of tradable assets on Coinbase. What this means: Popular assets have a large market cap, which may imply enthusiasm for the asset. Less popular assets may be relatively undiscovered.

The supply is fixed at 10,000,000 with 2,181,385 in current circulation. The 7th largest holders are INDEXcoop community, SET labs, or DeFi pulse multisigs or vesting contracts and account for 72% of tokens.\n\nVesting tokens will be released over 3 years from October 2020 to October 2023 based on the following schedule:\n\nThe INDEX contracts do not appear to have permissions that grant administrators unrestricted mint/burn capabilities.\n\n# Project\n\nINDEXcoop was formed in October 2020 by [SET protocol](https://www.tokensets.com/) and [DeFi pulse](https://www.pulse.inc/) to launch and manage on chain structured products. Currently these take two forms:\n\n* Sector indices which mint a single RRC20 token when the underlying tokens are deposited. Examples include DeFi Pulse Index ($DPI), Metaverse Index ($MVI), Data Economy ($DATA) and $BED (Which contains Bitcoin, Ether, $DPI)\n* Leveraged product created by depositing tokens into compound and then borrowing $USDC against the collateral.These include $ETH2-FLI and $BTC2-FLI.\n\nAll products are based on Set Protocol smart contracts and generate income by charging holders a streaming fee. In addition, the leveraged products charge issue and redeem fees.\n\nINDEX coop currently has $286 M AUM with zero being incentivised by [INDEXcoop] liquidity mining or staking. Daily income fluctuates, with a minimum of $10,000 per day over the last 2 months. Total cumulative income since launch in October 2020 was $1.7 M.\n\nThe INDEXcoop has been recognised as one of the leading DeFi communities and is currently dominating the structured products / index product category within DeFI.\n\n# Tokenomics\n\nThe INDEX token is currently a pure governance token for the INDEXcoop. Nor are there any token burn mechanisms in place. INDEX is based on the ERC20 standard.\n\nAt this time, other than LP’ing with the risk of IL, there are no productive ways to use INDEX tokens (i.e. single side staking, use as collateral).\n\nINDEXcoop recently did a strategic raise with 7,775,000 USDC held in the Treasury.\n\n# Community and Communication\n\nINDEXcoop main internal activity is on [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/ezuJ6ZZ) and [Discourse](https://gov.indexcoop.com/) with reference [docs](https://docs.indexcoop.com/) and [Snapshot ](https://snapshot.org/#/index)voting for IIP’s.

INDEXcoop [UI](https://github.com/SetProtocol/index-ui) and [smart contracts](https://github.com/SetProtocol/index-coop-smart-contracts) activity can be found on GitHub.\n\nThere is also a [DuneAnalytics](https://duneanalytics.com/jdcook/Index-Coop) board showing key metrics.\n\n# Available Audits\n\nThe Index Coop’s farming contracts are based on forks from Uniswap and Compound with minimal changes and have not been audited.\n\nThe Set Protocol contracts have been audited by[ ChainSecurity](https://www.setprotocol.com/pdf/chain_security_set_protocol_report.pdf?source=post_page---------------------------) and[ Trail of Bits](https://www.setprotocol.com/pdf/trail_of_bits_set_protocol_report.pdf?source=post_page---------------------------)\n\nThe new MetaGovernance module completed an audit with ABDK on 13/11/2020.\n\n# Market and Trading Data\n\n* INDEX price at the time of writing is $35.13\n* All-time high: $67.08 (09 May 2021)\n* All-time low: $1.33 (06 November 2020)\n* Price 90 days ago: $25.30\n* 2,181,385 tokens in circulation\n* 10,000,000 maximum supply.\n* The current market capitalization is $76,624,063\n* The INDEX token is available on exchanges, including Hoo.com and Bilaxy\n* The majority of trade volume is on Uniswap v3 and Sushiswap\n\nOn chain trade data:\n\nThere are currently [4 main](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Ib_LBgLZrwQfmT3-P0HByrq9A_1bllTZmNecFN6HmvU/edit?usp=sharing) on chain liquidity pools with significant INDEX:ETH trade volume. With varying fees and volumes. Only the Sushiswap pool received any Liquidity Mining incentives (INDEXcoop have never incentivised INDEX liquidity)\n\nNone of the pools offers LP’s IL protection.\n\n|10 Oct 2021|Sushi|Balancer v1|Uni v2|Uni v3|\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|AUM (11oct21)|$1,122,000|$1,200,000|$575,000|$1,560,000|\n|28 day average 24 H|$86,099|$12,014|$36,280|$179,244|\n|Fee|0.25%|2.00%|0.30%|1.00%|\n|Daily fee|$215|$240|$109|$1,792|\n|Average Fee Income|7.0%|7.3%|6.9%|41.9%|\n|Liquidity mining|30%|0.0%|0.0%|0.0%|\n|Total Income|37%|7.3%|6.9%|41.9%|\n\n**Benefits for Bancor:**\n\nAdding INDEX as a white listed pool will allow INDEX holders to make their INDEX tokens productive while being protected from IL. As INDEXcoop contributors are paid in INDEX, this will serve as an excellent way to attract the attention of a strong and active community.\n\nThe initial proposal is expected to create a pool equivalent to the AUM of any of the current pools and lower fee for traders. If this pool is successful in being filled and capturing some volume, then increasing the BNT allocation would be proposed.\n\nLong term the goal would be to work with the INDEXcoop community to enable Bancor to feel confident in whitelisting of INDEXcoop products (Particularly $DPI, $MVI, $DATA and $BED) as these attract significantly more volume than INDEX.",

Make sure to stake your vBNT for voting before this date and time to participate in the DAO decision.\n\nTo pass, this proposal requires 35% quorum and 66.7% supermajority.\n\n# TLDR\n* The Vortex Burner rate was increased to 10% in the beginning of June [1], 4 months ago.\n* Initial Vortex Burner rate schedule specified periodic incremental increases of 5% every 6 months [2].\n* Bancor's average APR wouldn't decrease significantly with this change.\n* The benefit to increasing the Vortex Burner rate is clear - increase the speed at which BNT liquidity is locked in the protocol forever. The projected vBNT burnt at 15% justifies the early increase.\n\n\n# Discussion\n\n### Average APRs\n\nThe impact of changing the vBNT rate from 10% to 15% on the average APR for an LP can be assessed by analysing the APRs of the bigger pools in Bancor. The weekly average APRs for 89% of the TVL were accounted for, **with the total average APR changing from 7.74%+-0.85% to 7.275%+-0.803%** \n\nFigure 1 - Analysis of the Vortex Burner rate impact on the weekly average APRs for the major pools.\n\n### Projected vBNT burnt\n\nAccumulated vBNT burnt has followed a linear pattern with an R^2 of 0.9966 \n\nAssuming this linear pattern is maintained until the end of the year - when the vortex burner rate would have been increased to 15% as per the original Vortex Burner proposal [2] - 1.98m vBNT would have been burnt by then.\n\nIncreasing the rate to 15% from the 21st of October and assuming that the vBNT/BNT ratio remains constant would mean that, by the end of the year, 2.82m vBNT would have been burnt by then. **This represents a 834k difference in burnt vBNT, or roughly $1.08m (with vBNT at $1.290).**",

Corporates, large and small, not-for-profit groups and insurtech startups can all come together to provide better products and services. We aim to use blockchain technology to help make the purchase and sale of insurance more efficient, enable lower operational costs, provide greater transparency into the industry and democratize access to reinsurance investments.\n\nThe projects main deliverable is the open source GIF (Generic Insurance Framework) which enables teams to independently develop and deploy insurance products. The GIF acts as the operating system while product developers may implement any business logic appropriate to represent the insurance product.\n\nOracle providers can offer data services which can be utilized by the insurance products.\nRisk Pool Keepers can launch risk pools as collateral for insurance products. The DIP token acts as a utility token for both staking and governance.\n\nThe project is active both in the DeFi space and in the traditional insurance business, especially in the microinsurance ecosystem. The largest deployment of an insurance product is a weather-index based crop insurance product with over 18,000 farmers onboarded.\n\nThe project has won numerous awards and received funding by reputable blockchain projects, notably the Ethereum Foundation and Chainlink.\n\n### Some more aspects: \n- Among the roughly 20 projects listed in the \"insurance\" category on Coingecko https://www.coingecko.com/en/categories/insurance , we are the only project dealing with real world risks\n- We have a working product with > 18.000 policies in Africa, which is the largest insurance product on blockchain by numbers\n- This product runs on our [open GIF platform](https://gif-monitor.etherisc.com/) - we are not a \"product company\" but a platform\n- We have received support from large players in the blockchain space, most notably by [Ethereum Foundation](https://blog.etherisc.com/etheriscs-crop-insurance-initiative-in-kenya-earns-support-from-ethereum-foundation-4f951df1db86) and [Chainlink](https://blog.etherisc.com/etherisc-teams-up-with-chainlink-to-deliver-crop-insurance-in-kenya-137e433c29dc), and also from NGOs like [Climate Ledger Initiative](https://blog.etherisc.com/etherisc-earns-support-from-the-climate-ledger-initiative-cli-and-swiss-agency-for-development-2858e51cc306)\n- We have a strong network in the traditional insurance business and in the microinsurance ecosystem\n- Community grew by 100% in the last 9 months\n\n## Tokenomics\n\nEtherisc’s native token, DIP (ERC20), is required to participate in risk pools which cover the insurance risks. Investors stake DIP tokens in these risk pools and receive rewards from the premiums of policies sold. DIP is also the governance token for DAOs which run the different GIF instances on the major blockchains. Therefore, the DIP token is a utility token, and not merely a symbolic representation of the project.\n\n## Community and Communication\nEtherisc is active on [Telegram](https://t.me/etherisc_community) (> 4K members), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/etherisc) (> 10K followers), [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmeGLuoTftzViYyIL4nSHYw) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/etherisc). The project maintains a [discourse forum](https://forum.etherisc.com/) and a [blog](https://blog.etherisc.com/). All code is open sourced and available on the [Github repos](https://github.com/etherisc). The team members are presented on the [team section](https://etherisc.com/#team) on the [Etherisc website](https://etherisc.com). [Christoph Mussenbrock](https://www.linkedin.com/in/christoph-mussenbrock/), the co-founder of the project and CEO of Etherisc GmbH, is the project’s main spokesperson. The team can be contacted via email contact@etherisc.com\n## Available Audits\n\nThe Token contract has been audited by three reputable auditors:\n\n* Christoph Jentzsch, Slock.it\n* Sebastian Bürgel, Validity Labs\n* Eugen Lechner, inacta AG\n\n## Market and Trading Data\n\n* DIP price at the time of writing is $0.076161\n* All-time high: $0.46 (Mar 29, 2021)\n* All-time low: $0.00227 (Jul 11, 2020)\n* Price 90 days ago: $0.0908\n* 191,854,113 tokens in circulation\n* 1,000,000,000 maximum supply.\n* The current market capitalization is $14,611,744.\n* The DIP token is available on Uniswap, 1inch and Honeyswap.\nUniswap has a liquidity of > 10 Million DIP tokens and a bandwidth (+/- 2%)\nof > USD 20K.\n\n# Benefits for Bancor:\n\nWe believe that a listing on Bancor will attract traders and LPs to the unique offerings of the Bancor platform, i.e. single-sided staking and IL protection. A listing on Bancor has been a top priority list for many community members. In turn, Etherisc will actively promote the Bancor platform for trading. We also expect synergies between the two protocols as we are exploring to integrate our insurance products and risk pools with the Bancor Protocol.\n\n\n",

      "content": "Expected to appear on Snapshot on October 17th\n\n# TL;DR\n\n* Proposal to whitelist APW (ERC-20)\n* Requesting a 250k BNT Co-investment to start\n* Although relatively new and unheard of (outside of yield farming connaisseur circles), APWine originally launched in August of 2020, ran an open Beta in February 2021, secured investment from top tier VC firms, partnered with top tier Defi protocols such as Harvest finance, has a co-founder of Aave as an Advisor, there is no reason to doubt the legitimacy of the project.\n* The benefit to Bancor is clear. Let’s bring more of Trad-Fi into DeFi together by encouraging more liquidity in tokenized yield markets so yield farmers can hedge their risk and traders can speculate on volatile APY rates.\n* There are no apparent security concerns that would prohibit whitelist status.\n\nAPWine token address: 0x4104b135dbc9609fc1a9490e61369036497660c8\n\nProject Website: [apwine.fi ](http://apwine.fi/)\n\n# Token Security\n\nUPDATE: Admin and Upgradability rights have been burned and is [verifiable onchain](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x1113a642a303b98cb81de72d750ec6715b6ddfbe3383149c0b1ba264a5d1625a)\n\nThe APWine contracts do not have permissions that grant administrators unrestricted mint/burn capabilities. The APW token supply was fairly distributed and launched via a [liquidity bootstrapping event.](https://apwine.medium.com/apwine-balancer-liquidity-bootstrapping-event-tge-f04ea1d3855e) A Maximum circulating supply of 32,624,947 $APW will be reached given the inverse curve for [distribution](https://docs.apwine.fi/introduction/tokenomics). The addresses with the highest concentration of APW tokens are predominantly the APWine Foundation and exchange partners.\n\n# Project\n\nAPWine is a protocol that allows users to deposit their interest-bearing tokens in order to tokenize the yield generated by their interest-bearing tokens. APWine splits interest-bearing assets into Principal Tokens and Future Yield Tokens. Using the custom APWine AMM, users can sell their APYs ahead of time. By buying, selling, and/or trading FUture Yield Tokens, defi users are able to hedge their exposure to volatile yield and also speculate on arbitrage opportunities. FYT holders can claim their yield at maturity which is typically 30 days.\n\n# Tokenomics\n\nThe APW token is an ERC-20 token, with a primary focus on protocol governance through the APWine DAO. APW is also used as an incentive token for liquidity providers. Through the liquidity bootstrapping and TGE event, a fair distribution to the community was completed. The APWine DAO will be involved in future protocol focuses and potential partner integrations.\n\n# Community and Communication\n\nAPWine is active on [Telegram](https://t.me/APWineFinance), [Discord, ](https://discord.gg/AxbH7sE6sc) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/APWineFinance). Activity on [GitHub](https://github.com/APWine) is frequent, with new updates appearing every few days. The [development team](https://www.apwine.fi/) and advisors are presented on the homepage of the APWine website. Gaspard Peduzzi, the co-founder of APWine, is the project’s main spokesperson. APWine is based in Europe with and includes a global remote team.\n\n# Available Audits\n\nAPWine has been audited at least 4 times since 2020, by reputable auditors:\n\n* Quantstamp\n* Peckshield\n* APWine will also be hosting an ongoing bug bounty program\n\n# Benefits for Bancor:\n\nThe Bancor ecosystem will benefit from exposure to APW by hosting the deepest liquidity pool for APW pairs which can naturally attract yield farmers and speculators of yield. Tokenizing and trading yield is a very new (to-defi) that we expect will become a huge market in and of itself. In traditional markets, this is known as “bond stripping” or “coupon bonds” and accounts for trillions in global trade volumes. There is no shortage of volatile APY in the world of DeFi, so a simple way to hedge risk and arbitrage volatile APY rates is in high demand. We are seeking to establish deeper integrations with Bancor Protocol and all of the ecosystem partners as a priority for APWine. The APWine team has pre-emptively prepared to organize a buy-back program to coincide with the pool. \n\nWe are requesting a 250K BNT Co-investment to start and will work diligently to ensure a positive long term impact is made within the Bancor Ecosystem.\n",

The Bancor DAO can act accordingly, at will, in order to protect the health of the protocol.  The initial proposal for LM was assuming certain Eden Network metrics stay constant, and for Eden Network to keep up their end of deal.  On the contrary, these metrics have decreased, Eden fails to keep Bancor as a slot tenant consistently, and free alternatives to Eden Network have been released for the same service. In light of the presented new information, it would do the Bancor community a disservice to continue the LM rewards on the EDEN side of the BNT-EDEN pool.\n\n\nWhy 100% BNT, instead of outright cancellation of LM?\n\nAs a wise man once said, \"LM on BNT side is 1000% okay.\"",

Make sure to stake your vBNT for voting before this date and time to participate in the DAO decision.\n\n**TLDR**\n\n* This proposal seeks to increase the Co-investment limit to 2M BNT for the **EDEN** pool.\n* It will open up space for LPs on the TKN side ( **EDEN** ) and increase the depth of the pool as LPs add liquidity\n* A larger **EDEN** pool will attract more trades from aggregators and professional market makers to Bancor which ultimately leads to more fees for our platform.\n\n**For**\n\n1. A larger co-investment limit on the pool will let LPs provided single sided liquidity and will lead to an increase in pool depth\n2. More liquidity in the **EDEN-BNT** pool should lead to larger volume from DEX aggregators and professional market makers sent in our direction\n3. More volume for Bancor leads to more fees for our platform and **BNT** holders\n\n**Against**\n\n1. We should not increase the limit on the pool.\n\n**Abstract**\nThere is currently **~1.2M BNT** and **~1.5M EDEN** tokens in the BNT-EDEN [pool](https://etherscan.io/address/0x3870Ce6642959E3D844837Fd472E717736E06AAe). This has resulted in a pool that has roughly **~9.3M** in liquidity. At the moment, LPs on the TKN side (EDEN) can’t provide single sided liquidity since there is no capacity. This proposal is seeking to increase single-sided capacity in the EDEN pool by increasing the Co-investment limit to **2M BNT** .\n\n![image|483x306](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/bancordao/original/2X/a/a1d4eb4cdbf9e1d6ba093d66d07c3c04993f72d5.png)\n\n**Motivation**\n\nIf we want to attract more EDEN LPs to Bancor, we need to open up space in the pool so that they can provide single sided liquidity. This would allow us to grow the liquidity in the pool and attract larger trades towards our platform which ultimately results in higher fees for Bancor. \n\nThe top pool for EDEN is on Sushiswap and it is paired with ETH. Pool depth is roughly **~59M** and we should be able to make the Bancor pool deeper to support larger trades with low price impact:\n\n![image|652x156](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/bancordao/original/2X/8/89a9f1d7afc01f08d10a8508c8bbbb99e704d725.png)\n\nCurrently, the Bancor pool has no space available and LPs can’t provide single sided liquidity on the TKN side (EDEN). I am proposing a **2M** Co-investment limit for the EDEN pool which should open up roughly **5.6M** in additional single sided liquidity (assuming BNT price at $3.50). If this pools fills up completely, we would have a pool that’s roughly **~20M** in depth and be more competitive with the sushiswap pool.",

Make sure to stake your vBNT for voting before this date and time to participate in the DAO decision.\n\n# Proposal to Whitelist Auctus Token (AUC)\n\n# TL;DR\n\n* Proposal to whitelist AUC.\n* Proposed co-investment is 100,000 BNT.\n* There are no apparent security concerns that would prohibit whitelist status.\n* There is no reason to doubt the legitimacy of the Auctus project.\n* The benefit to Bancor is clear.\n\nAUC token address: 0xc12d099be31567add4e4e4d0d45691c3f58f5663\n\nProject Website: https://auctus.org/\n\n# Token Security\n\nAUC does not have an elastic supply, or rebase mechanism. The Auctus contracts do not have permissions that grant administrators unrestricted mint/burn capabilities. The AUC token supply is fixed at 65,829,630, of which 35,456,754 are in current circulation. The contracts and addresses with the highest concentration of AUC tokens are predominantly the contracts with options mining liquidity program rewards, Reserve and team’s wallets, and an Uniswap V3 pool.\n\n![|602x224](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/bancordao/optimized/2X/d/da185c5f4315af76ebacb36cc481649d26480ad3_2_1204x448.png)\n\n# Project\n\nAuctus started as an early mover in the DeFi space aiming to innovate the pension/retirement space in 2018. Despite shipping several products in the niche (Auctus Experts, Auctus Terminal, and Auctus Mobile), the team noticed that the world of DeFi and retirement planning did not provide a suitable product market fit. Through their early work in the DeFi space the team discovered both the opportunity and implementation of on-chain options, making them one of the first movers in the on-chain derivatives space. From there things started quickly picking up.\n\nIn May of 2020 the Auctus options protocol went live making it the first American-Style options protocol, and the second on-chain options protocol in the world (only pre-ceded by Opyn). Four months later it surpassed $1mm in TVL. While DeFi summer cooled down, Auctus saw renewed interest from the community, securing an activist investment from Hartmann Capital. In Q3/4 2020, Auctus went on to launch its options AMM, the first options Vaults, released its new token model, and became the first options protocol to launch options OTC allowing anyone to create any ERC-20 options they want.\n\nWith a near complete suite of options products the team is looking to improve liquidity, collateral capital efficiency, and data visualization in 2021, as well as integrate Auctus options into the wider DeFi ecosystem in 2021 and beyond.\n\n# Tokenomics\n\nAUC is a value accrual token that is tied to the value generated by the options network. When options traders engage with the Auctus protocol by buying, selling, writing and exercising options, or using the options vaults, fees accrued are sent to the Black Hole address which uses the accrued fees to provide liquidity for AUC on decentralized exchanges. This provides both an instant buying pressure, as well as permanent price support. Unlike the Buy & Burn Model, the Blackhole Model creates a token sink with the side benefit of providing deep liquidity over time and a minimum intrinsic network value based on the reserve assets (ETH, USDC, WBTC) deposited into the blackhole.\n\n# Community and Communication\n\nAuctus is active o [Telegram](https://t.me/auctusoptions), [Discord](https://discord.gg/9JqeMxs). The Auctus team also operates official [Twitter](https://twitter.com/AuctusOptions) accounts. Activity on [GitHub](http://github.com/AuctusProject/) is frequent, with new updates appearing every month. The development team and advisors are presented in the team section on the [Auctus website](https://auctus.org/). The Auctus website includes a contact email for general inquiries: contact@auctus.org\n\n# Available Audits\n\nAuctus core protocol has been [audited by OpenZeppelin](https://blog.openzeppelin.com/aco-protocol-audit/).\n\n# Market and Trading Data\n\n* Auctus’ price at the time of writing is $0.080563\n* All-time high: $1.09 (May 06, 2018)\n* All-time low: $0.00097544 (Nov 18, 2019)\n* Price 90 days ago: $0.080250\n* 35,456,754 tokens in circulation\n* 65,829,630 maximum supply.\n* The current market capitalization is $3,589,285\n* The Auctus token is available on multiple exchanges, including Sushiswap, Uniswap, PancakeSwap, HitBTC, Hoo, Balancer.\n* Deepest AMM pool is UniswapV3 with ~$350k in liquidity.\n* The daily spot volume avg is ~$25,000\n\n# Benefits for Bancor:\n\nAuctus users trade mainly using DEX exchanges and are very active on DeFi space, which means a high percentage of the community will try and join the Bancor ecosystem. In addition to this, the team will actively promote Bancor DEX whenever users ask where they should trade, since Bancor will become the most liquid dex venue for trading AUC.",

Make sure to stake your vBNT for voting before this date and time to participate in the DAO decision.\n\nProposal is very similar to the [previous LM rewards extension](https://gov.bancor.network/t/proposal-lm-extension-on-stable-pools-dai-usdc-usdt/2622).\n\nTo pass, this proposal needs 35% quorum and 66.7% supermajority.\n\n# TL;DR\n\n1. The LM rewards on stablecoin pools (DAI, USDC, USDT) are extended from the 28th October 2021 until 4th January 2022 (another 12 weeks), and can continue being extended by the DAO.\n2. The LM rewards are extended to maintain current stable pools protocol’s liquidity in anticipation of Bancor V3.\n3. To support the flawless migration, a new liquidity mining program will be released together with the Bancor V3 release.\n\n# Discussion\n\n* At this stage, current protocol growth requires LM to maintain the momentum and stay competitive in the space (the DAO seems aware of this).\n* After achieving the position of market leader in both TVL and volume, LM extension will no longer be necessary, and the voting for LM extensions may be concluded.\n* Bancor V3 will significantly reduce the pressure resulting from insurance on all the assets, and should increase the protocol revenue from trading fees.\n* A large majority of the LM rewards are re-staked to the protocol, increasing the TVL and the space available for TKN deposits with single sided exposure. If this trend continues, the LM program is more of an asset than a liability, and can be managed more assertively.\n* In the long term, Bancor is aiming towards sustainable annual inflation of 2%, in order to achieve that, Bancor requires significant volume and Vortex to be applied.\n\n# Summary\n\n* Bancor should not lose the momentum and cut out the LM rewards on stablecoins.\n* The current LM rewards will be changed together with the release of Bancor V3.\n* Current stable tokens liquidity is essential to stay in the ecosystem to maintain the protocol momentum and support the migration of liquidity from v2.1 to V3.\n\n# Volume and fees\n\nWeekly volume and fees from the USDC, DAI and USDT pool from the week of the 28th of June (when LM rewards were last extended) has been consistent (Figure 1 and 2).\n\n![image|690x171](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/bancordao/optimized/2X/b/b1e80f1bf57bbdf44956d7b31fdf9d3f89cc620c_2_1380x342.png)\nFigure 1 - Weekly Fees for DAI, USDC and USDT pools.\n\n![image|690x172](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/bancordao/optimized/2X/6/67e10d2bc701bae349954eacd305099512206da4_2_1380x344.png)\nFigure 2 - Weekly volume for DAI, USDC and USDT pools.",

Make sure to stake your vBNT for voting before this date and time to participate in the DAO decision.\n\nTo pass, this proposal requires 35% quorum and 66.7% supermajority.\n\n# TLDR\n\n* This proposal seeks to increase the Co-investment limit from 100k BNT to 300k BNT for the FRM/BNT pool.\n* A larger FRM/BNT pool will reduce price impact and therefore attract more trades from retail users, aggregators and professional market makers to Bancor.\n* Bancor is Ferrum Network's official Ethereum buyback platform, and both Ferrum and Bancor would benefit from increasing the depth of the pool to reduce price impact and become the most favourable option perform the FRM buybacks.\n\n\n# Rationale\n\n* The Ferrum team performs token buybacks on their preferred partners, Bancor (Ethereum), Dfyn (Polygon) and Apeswap (BSC) [1].\n* The FRM DEX pools with the deepest liquidity are Uniswap v2 ETH/FRM with $1,717,371 [2], ApeSwap FRM/WBNB with $924,113 [3] and DFyn ETH/FRM with $285,179 [4]. \n* Current co-investment is 100k BNT which, at 1 BNT = $4.03, allows for a pool liquidity of $806k.\n* A 300k BNT co-investment would allow for $2.4m liquidity to be added to the pool. The FRM/BNT pool would then become the DEX market leader by depth and it would be in Ferrum Network's best interest to use it more often to perform their token buybacks.\n* The extrapolated yearly APRs based in the past 24hr volume in the Uniswap v2 ETH/FRM, ApeSwap FRM/WBNB and DFyn ETH/FRM pools are 22.91%, 1.74% and 3.97%, respectively.\n* The space in the pool isn't full yet but incentivising it is definitely worth it. If needed, LM rewards can be considered at a later stage. For now, it is essential to increase the space in the pool to allow for more liquidity in and consequentially drive more FRM volume to Bancor. \n\n\n# For\n\nIncrease pool co-investment from 100k BNT to 300k BNT.\n\n# Against\n\nKeep the pool co-investment at 100k BNT.\n\n\n[1] https://twitter.com/FerrumNetwork/status/1443984842300039187\n[2] https://v2.info.uniswap.org/pair/0x92330d8818e8a3b50f027c819fa46031ffba2c8c\n[3] https://info.apeswap.finance/pair/0x9faa4d36d9d7158b15f408bf7357288d6ad8bc04\n[4] https://info.dfyn.network/pair/0xc208605bbceb73a431ebdf19934e5a3aef025425",

      "content": "### This proposal is expected to appear on Snapshot for voting on [date=2021-10-03 time=12:00:00 timezone=\"UTC\"]. Make sure to stake your vBNT for voting before this date and time to participate in the DAO decision.\n\n# TL;DR\n\n* Proposal to whitelist VLX.\n* Proposed co-investment is 100,000 BNT.\n* There are no apparent security concerns that would prohibit whitelist status.\n* There is no reason to doubt the legitimacy of the Velas project.\n* The benefit to Bancor is clear.\n\nVLX token address: 0x8c543aed163909142695f2d2acd0d55791a9edb9\n\n****Project Website: [https://velas.com](https://velas.com)\n\n**Project**\n\nVelas Network is an Ecosystem of Decentralized products that allow anyone to feel the benefits of blockchain technology.\n\n**What we do?**\n\nWe are building an open-sourced blockchain ecosystem of services and products, aiming to combine the best qualities of both centralized and decentralized solutions. It involves researching state-of-the-art cryptography, developing consensus protocols and designing intuitive user interfaces providing developers, enterprises and people worldwide to create and join easily accessible, transparent and community-governed ecosystem for web 3.0.\n\n**Our vision**\n\nWe believe that disruptive technologies and innovations will empower us to build a self-governed, decentralized future driven by the collective intelligence of the community.\n\n**Our mission**\n\nOur mission is to create and integrate world-changing technology products and services to improve people's lives all over the globe.\n\n**What Makes Velas Unique?**\n\n* EVM - supports all smart contracts and dApps built on the Ethereum stack.\n* Instant, low-cost transactions - extremely efficient performance at a fraction of the cost.\n* Velas Account - passwordless solution that facilitates interaction with blockchain apps to the level of Google account and PayPal-like convenience, without sacrificing on our user's security.\n* Access Management - a decentralized access management system, which allows users to control access to files on IPFS using multiple encryption types.\n* Velas Vault - a novel solution to store secrets and private keys. This enables various use cases, such as decentralized custody solutions of assets native to other blockchains (BTC, ETH, ERC-20, etc).\n* Velas Wallet - multi-currency Wallet with staking functionality.\n* MicroApps - Velas will soon support cross-platform decentralized applications where not only the code (logic) is stored on-chain, but also its user interface.\n\nTo resolve the scalability issue, we’ve built our solution based on Solana complementing it with additional features and innovations.\n\nCurrently achievable performance metrics:\n\n· 59,490 Transactions per Second\n· 400ms Block times\n· $0.00001 fee per transaction\n\nMoreover, Velas is a community-driven project. At any time our community members can vote for the next product our team will place a priority on. This feature and the fact that anyone can join our network as a validator or delegator - makes both Velas and Velas Blockchain decentralized by nature.\n\n**Tokenomics**\n\nTokenomics are the economic rules of behavior and interaction of participants in the blockchain network. Velas' consensus is based on DPoS economics. A set of rules has been established to provide participants with the most favorable conditions for interaction with each other and motivate them to act for the benefit of the network.\n\n**Basic VLX metrics:**\n\nTotal supply - 2,124,380,663 VLX;\nCirculating Supply - 1,419,198,849 VLX;\nInflation rate - 8% annually.\n\n**Available Audits**\n\nVelas has been audited at least four times since 2019, by reputable auditors:\n\n[Peppersec](https://github.com/poanetwork/tokenbridge/tree/2.6.0/audit/peppersec) (May 2019)\n\n[Smartdec](https://github.com/poanetwork/tokenbridge/tree/2.6.0/audit/smartdec) (Aug 2019)\n\n[Quantstamp](https://github.com/poanetwork/tokenbridge/tree/2.6.0/audit/quantstamp) (Jan 2020)\n\n[Quantstamp](https://github.com/poanetwork/tokenbridge/tree/2.6.0/audit/quantstamp) (Nov 2020)\n\n**Community and Communication**\n\nVelas is mostly active on, global [Telegram](https://t.me/velascommunity) group, and also international communities:\n\n⛓ Technical Group:\n\nhttps://t.me/VelasDevelopers\n\n**Who Are the Founders of Velas**\n\n[Velas Network AG](https://www.velas.com/) is an ecosystem startup based in Switzerland. It was founded in 2019 by Canadian citizen[ Alex Alexandrov](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ervichov/), a prominent blockchain and crypto entrepreneur, and investor. He is also a founder of[ CoinPayments](https://www.coinpayments.net/) --- the world's #1 payment gateway for cryptocurrencies; advisor and investor of[ Mind AI](https://mind.ai/) --- a well-known Korean AI startup. Alex is consulting the FBI, Europol and several national governments on technology, cybersecurity, blockchain, and AI implementation.\n\nThe Velas Network AG mailing address in Switzerland, and our contact e-mails:\n\n* Mailing, Dammstrasse 16, Zug 6300 Switzerland\n* Technical support email, support@velas.com\n* Press email and general inquiries info@velas.com\n\n**Benefits for Bancor:**\n\nAs seen above, VLX places a high value on growing a strong international community which could help expose new traders to Bancor. We believe our community would also be very interested in supplying liquidity to this pair, as this would be their first opportunity to take advantage of Bancor’s single-sided staking and IL protection. We often hold AMAs via Telegram and would be thrilled to conduct AMAs with Bancor. We would put out announcements in the form of Twitter, Telegram, and Medium articles for this listing and every development in the partnership. VLX is currently trading on several top tier CEXs along with Pancakeswap and Uniswap as well. If whitelisted on Bancor, the increased arbitrage and price movement could bring a lot of volume to the pair. With several existing projects on chain and over 40 projects in our pipeline we will have increasing utility, demand and volume in the days ahead and would be eager to look for more opportunities for integration.",

      "content": "# Proposal to Whitelist ShapeShift FOX Token (FOX)\n\n## This proposal is expected to appear on Snapshot for voting on Sunday, October 3, 2021 at 12:00 pm UTC\n\n# TL;DR\n* Proposal to whitelist FOX.\n* Proposed co-investment is 100,000 BNT.\n* There are no apparent security concerns that would prohibit whitelist status.\n* There is no reason to doubt the legitimacy of the ShapeShift project.\n* The benefits to Bancor are clear.\n\n### Token Address: **0xc770eefad204b5180df6a14ee197d99d808ee52d**\n### Project Website: **https://shapeshift.com**\n\n# Benefits for Bancor\n1. If the FOX/BNT pool on Bancor is incentivized with BNT and/or FOX Tokens, ShapeShift will deploy an open-source UI for providing/managing liquidity to the FOX/BNT pool on Bancor, which would pave the way for providing liquidity to any pool on Bancor via ShapeShift\n2. A deep FOX/BNT pool will drive more trade volume through Bancor. This has the potential to be the deepest FOX liquidity pool.\n3. There is currently no option to stake FOX one-sidedly and earn yield. This will be a compelling option for FOX holders and can introduce them to Bancor and the world of one-sided LPing.\n\n# Token Security \nFOX does not have an elastic supply, or rebase mechanism. The ShapeShift contracts do not have permissions that grant administrators unrestricted mint/burn capabilities. The FOX token supply is fixed at 1,000,001,337, of which 56,955,476 are in current circulation. The contracts and addresses with the highest concentration of FOX tokens are predominantly the token vesting contracts, the 16 airdrop contracts, the FOX Foundation’s cold storage, the FOX/ETH Uniswap liquidity pool and liquidity mining staking rewards contract, and the DAO’s Gnosis Safe Treasury. The token supply and distribution is detailed here: https://shapeshift.com/shapeshift-decentralize-airdrop\n\n**![|602x547](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/bancordao/optimized/2X/7/76ab9535f7361c455ebecb7027a5ddc9b1c9e9ad_2_1100x1000.png)**\n\n# Project\nSince ShapeShift’s formation in 2014, our purpose has been to empower the digital asset market in alignment with the ethos of financial sovereignty.\n\nSeven years ago, we pioneered frictionless crypto trading with no user accounts, and no custody of user funds.\n\n# ![|602x188](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/bancordao/optimized/2X/8/85948402153907dacb596f4509285e9b2348d387_2_1204x376.jpeg)\n\n* In 2017, we acquired KeepKey to bring easy cold-storage to our users.\n\n* In 2018, we built a full self-custody crypto interface that incorporated KeepKey, Ledger, and Trezor hardware wallets with integrated trading functionality across chains.\n\n* In 2019, we removed all commissions for holders of the FOX Token.\n\n* In 2020, we acquired Portis to further engage with the burgeoning web3 dapp ecosystem and released ShapeShift’s self-custody mobile app.\n\n* And by late 2020, we began integrating decentralized protocols directly into the ShapeShift crypto platform to enable immutable, borderless trading with no intermediary, removing ourselves—and our prior business model—from the process.\n\nThis evolution enabled us to return protection and dignity to our users, ending KYC and other intrusive financial surveillance practices. ShapeShift will never be a bank. The end goal has been and remains: a world where people are empowered to manage their own financial futures, without sacrificing their privacy and control to governmental and middlemen entities. A world where users can participate in and explore new voluntary forms of financial innovation.\n\nIt has become clear to us that decentralization is the only way to achieve borderless, immutable finance. Therefore, decentralizing ShapeShift is how we choose to maintain fidelity to the principles first established by Satoshi and the Bitcoin whitepaper.\n\nStarting today, our process of decentralization will occur in steps:\n\n* It means ShapeShift will, over time, go fully open-source.\n\n* It means ShapeShift will dismantle its entire corporate structure in a way that respects our shareholders and empowers our employees.\n\n* It means the ownership and governance over ShapeShift’s future moves to the broad and decentralized community of FOX Token holders, starting now.\n\nTo our knowledge, no established company has ever decentralized itself to this degree. This is new ground that we hope will inspire others as well.\n\nIt is with great enthusiasm and gratitude to the many pioneers around us that we begin this next phase of ShapeShift’s journey.\n\nWe begin this new phase from a position of strength. Since 2014, ShapeShift has grown to support a broad community of users and has facilitated a vast number of crypto transactions (as of the end of May 2021):\n\n![|602x164](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/bancordao/optimized/2X/f/f42d2dde2434f00bf63fb1dd3e5743824881381f_2_1204x328.png)\n\nWe’ve continually evolved to offer users access to a range of widely requested, innovative services and capabilities, without friction:\n\n* Trading via 0x DEX aggregation with the best rates available\n\n* Cross-chain swaps, including native BTC to ETH, via THORChain integration\n\n* Earn interest by providing FOX & ETH liquidity on Uniswap V2 (and hopefully Bancor soon :slight_smile: )\n\n* Fully non-custodial, including our secure native software wallet\n\n* Accessible with KeepKey and most prominent hardware wallets including Ledger and Trezor\n\n* Fast and private, with no account or KYC required\n\n# Tokenomics\n\n![image|690x378](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/bancordao/optimized/2X/3/33c17443ae55e6bd798e06bfd0fad66faff77428_2_1380x756.jpeg)\n\nSee https://shapeshift.com/fox/benefits and https://forum.shapeshift.com/t/workstream-fox-tokenomics/43 for more info on FOX Tokenomics\n\n# Available Audits\n[**FOX Token contract**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_oNF4OFRVPP3WsWxDVLcVnml98Ow_ZLj/view?usp=sharing)\n**[Airdrop Smart Contracts](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1TgLIEWxGTPlCoJ3_o4wneSpT_zPAZVTq/view?usp=sharing)**\n**[Staking Rewards Contract](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hQaB_hoZw4Q8_S7E8B4SjiFpskeePk92/view?usp=sharing)**",

      "content": "### This proposal is expected to appear on Snapshot for voting on [date=2021-09-12 time=12:00:00 timezone=\"UTC\"]. Make sure to stake your vBNT for voting before this date and time to participate in the DAO decision.\n\n# TL;DR\n\n* Proposal to whitelist APW (ERC-20)\n* Requesting a 250k BNT Co-investment to start\n* Although relatively new and unheard of (outside of yield farming connaisseur circles), APWine originally launched in August of 2020, ran an open Beta in February 2021, secured investment from top tier VC firms, partnered with top tier Defi protocols such as Harvest finance, has a co-founder of Aave as an Advisor, there is no reason to doubt the legitimacy of the project.\n* The benefit to Bancor is clear. Let’s bring more of Trad-Fi into DeFi together by encouraging more liquidity in tokenized yield markets so yield farmers can hedge their risk and traders can speculate on volatile APY rates.\n* There are no apparent security concerns that would prohibit whitelist status.\n\nAPWine token address: 0x4104b135dbc9609fc1a9490e61369036497660c8\n\nProject Website: [apwine.fi](http://apwine.fi)\n\n\n# Token Security\n\nThe APWine contracts do not have permissions that grant administrators unrestricted mint/burn capabilities. The APW token supply was fairly distributed and launched via a [liquidity bootstrapping event.](https://apwine.medium.com/apwine-balancer-liquidity-bootstrapping-event-tge-f04ea1d3855e) A Maximum circulating supply of 32,624,947 $APW will be reached given the inverse curve for [distribution](https://docs.apwine.fi/introduction/tokenomics). The addresses with the highest concentration of APW tokens are predominantly the APWine Foundation and exchange partners.\n\n# Project\n\nAPWine is a protocol that allows users to deposit their interest-bearing tokens in order to tokenize the yield generated by their interest-bearing tokens. APWine splits interest-bearing assets into Principal Tokens and Future Yield Tokens. Using the custom APWine AMM, users can sell their APYs ahead of time. By buying, selling, and/or trading FUture Yield Tokens, defi users are able to hedge their exposure to volatile yield and also speculate on arbitrage opportunities. FYT holders can claim their yield at maturity which is typically 30 days. \n\n# Tokenomics\n\nThe APW token is an ERC-20 token, with a primary focus on protocol governance through the APWine DAO. APW is also used as an incentive token for liquidity providers. Through the liquidity bootstrapping and TGE event, a fair distribution to the community was completed. The APWine DAO will be involved in future protocol focuses and potential partner integrations.\n\n# Community and Communication\n\nAPWine is active on [Telegram](https://t.me/APWineFinance), [Discord,](https://discord.gg/AxbH7sE6sc) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/APWineFinance). Activity on [GitHub](https://github.com/APWine) is frequent, with new updates appearing every few days. The [development team](https://www.apwine.fi/) and advisors are presented on the homepage of the APWine website. Gaspard Peduzzi, the co-founder of APWine, is the project’s main spokesperson. APWine is based in Europe with and includes a global remote team.\n\n# Available Audits\n\nAPWine has been audited at least 4 times since 2020, by reputable auditors:\n\n* Quantstamp\n* Peckshield\n* APWine will also be hosting an ongoing bug bounty program\n\n# Benefits for Bancor:\n\nThe Bancor ecosystem will benefit from exposure to APW by hosting the deepest liquidity pool for APW pairs which can naturally attract yield farmers and speculators of yield. Tokenizing and trading yield is a very new (to-defi) that we expect will become a huge market in and of itself. In traditional markets, this is known as “bond stripping” or “coupon bonds” and accounts for trillions in global trade volumes. There is no shortage of volatile APY in the world of DeFi, so a simple way to hedge risk and arbitrage volatile APY rates is in high demand. We are seeking to establish deeper integrations with Bancor Protocol and all of the ecosystem partners as a priority for APWine.\n\nWe are requesting a 250K BNT Co-investment to start.",

Since ETH is already whitelisted on Bancor and this being wrapped ETH then our security requirements should be met. \n\nNote that most of the liquidity for WETH resides on other DeFi protocols which are using it natively.\n\n![image|690x269](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/bancordao/optimized/2X/b/b3805f3a79a96c7bd98e4398fe4787d6e5a52785_2_1380x538.png)\n\n\n# Project\n\nETH doesn't conform to the ERC-20 standard and was released before it existed. In order for DAPPs to be able to use ETH, they have to interact with a representation of ETH that is compatible with the ERC-20 token standard. Most DAPPs opt to use wETH as their base token for their pools for this specific reason. There are steps being taken to make ETH conformant to the ERC-20 token standard in the future.\n\n# Tokenomics\n\nEther is used to pay gas fees on every transaction. Once migrated to Eth2, validators will stake the tokens to participate in consensus and receive block rewards.\n\nWith the Beacon Chain in production, users can deposit their ETH into the Deposit Contract to claim a validator slot on the Ethereum 2.0 network. Validators have the right to stake ETH on the Beacon Chain to participate in block production and earn staking rewards.\n\n# Community and Communication\n\nEthereum operates similarly to Bitcoin through off-chain, informal governance. In this model, developers can submit protocol upgrades, dubbed Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs), on Ethereum's open-source GitHub repository. Core Ethereum developers then discuss new proposals, with additional input from the extended community. If approved by a majority vote, core developers merge the changes into the base code. To avoid complications post-merge, node operators must update their clients to the latest software.\n\n# Available Audits\n\nThe Ethereum 2.0 Prysm client was [audited](https://certificate.quantstamp.com/full/prysm) by Quantstamp.\n\n# Market and Trading Data\n\n* WETH price at the time of writing is $3333\n* All-time high: $4,327.08 (May 12, 2021)\n* All-time low: $94.87 (Mar 13, 2020)\n* Price 90 days ago: $2554\n* N/A tokens in circulation\n* N/A maximum supply.\n* The current market capitalization is N/A\n* Token Fully Diluted market Capitalization is around N/A\n* WETH is available on many different DEXes and can also be wrapped by anyone.\n* The highest 24-hour spot volume on DEXes is $225M on Sushiswap.",

The Ferrum contracts do not have permissions that grant administrators unrestricted mint/burn capabilities. The FRM token supply is fixed at 331,718,750, of which 152,644,714.33 are in current circulation. The contracts and addresses with the highest concentration of FRM tokens are predominantly the token treasury, CEX and DEX liquidity, and early Ferrum community holders. A list of MetaMask wallets can be found [here](https://etherscan.io/token/0xe5caef4af8780e59df925470b050fb23c43ca68c#balances).\n\n# Project\n\nFerrum Network was launched by a team of crypto industry experts in June 2018 with the goal to break down barriers to entry and encourage the mainstream adoption of cryptocurrencies on a global scale. Ferrum Network is a deflationary cross-chain Blockchain as a Service DeFi company that specializes in adding token utility and advisory services to projects across the crypto space. Ferrum builds white-label blockchain solutions that empower startups and established organizations, enabling them to continue to get their core products to market faster.\n\n# Tokenomics\n\nFerrum’s native token, FRM, is required to access Monthly Holder Reward and presales. We also offer our holders a multitude of staking options that produce high APYs with rewards paid out in our rewards token FRMx. There is a considerable amount of consistent buy pressure on the token as the company conducts bi-weekly buybacks of FRM and also buys back a FRM with every sale of one of our white label products. The company averages about 10k USD worth of FRM in buybacks every week.\n\n# Community and Communication\n\nFerrum is active on Twitter, Telegram, YouTube, Medium, and TikTok. The team and advisors are presented on the [About Us](https://ferrum.network/about-us/) tab on Ferrum's website. Ian Friend, the co-founder and COO of Ferrum, is the project’s main spokesperson. Ian attends AMAs frequently and keeps the community informed by recording interviews and regular “Community Update Videos.” Ferrum also sends out a Monthly Newsletter containing all of the latest developments for the prior month. Ferrum boasts an extremely active community with over 20k in the Telegram channel and nearly 40k on Twitter.\n\n# Available Audits\n\nZokyo Audit: https://t.co/cLXerrKQwH?amp=1\n\nBenefits for Bancor:\n\n### Loyal Community\n\nFerrum prides itself on having one of the strongest and most loyal communities in crypto. Our token holders are the epitome of HODLERs. There are a multitude of ways that folks make passive income through holding FRM. Just by holding FRM you are eligible for monthly airdrops in our FRMx reward token. Holding FRM gets our community access into presales of the projects that we incubate through Ferrum Advisory Services. The more FRM you hold the greater these benefits are so the community is constantly accumulating.\n\n### Dealflow\n\nCurrently, we have well over 100 clients between our Staking as a Service solutions, Cross Chain Token Bridge, and projects that we incubate through Ferrum Advisory Services. When you take into consideration the extensive list of additional products that we are currently developing, it becomes clear that our ecosystem is destined for continued astronomical growth.\n\nOur ecosystem of partner projects is called the Iron Alliance. This is a group of over 50 founders of tier 1 projects who are always looking for opportunities such as the one Bancor provides. By partnering with Ferrum you join the Iron Alliance and immediately have access to a deep pool of potential partners and clients.\n\n### Technology Products\n\nAt Ferrum, we build white label products that empower other projects. Between our Cross-Chain Token Bridge and our white label Staking as a Service solutions, we have helped to add utility to over 100 projects across multiple chains.\n\nCross-Chain Token Bridge\n\nWith our Cross-Chain Token Bridge we could help bridge liquidity for not only Bancor but also tokens who are currently whitelisted. We can tap into the Bancor DEX LPs to supply the bridge liquidity for projects who decide to list on the bridge and are also listed on Bancor.\n\nStaking as a Service\n\nOut of our six different Staking as a Service products, one in particular stands out in regard to Bancor. We have a specific contract that can be deployed right on Bancors website that enables the staking and locking of LP tokens. For example; a set of BNT holders pair BNT/ETH and stake the LP tokens in a dashboard that we build out for Bancor in a white label fashion. You can choose to pay rewards in BNT with customizable APYs, maturity dates, early withdrawal options, etc. You can even whitelist certain addresses.\n\n### Token Buybacks\n\nThere is a considerable amount of consistent buy pressure on the token as the company conducts bi-weekly buybacks of FRM and also buys back a FRM with every sale of one of our white label products. The company averages about 10k USD worth of FRM in buybacks every week. With the whitelisting of FRM, we can commit to conducting a portion of these buybacks exclusively through Bancor and mentioning them with each announcement that a buyback is conducted through Bancor. These buybacks and announcements are currently taking place about 3-5 times a week.\n\n### Marketing Content\n\nAs mentioned earlier, Ferrum boasts a rabidly loyal community. We often hold AMAs both via Telegram and interview style AMAs on YouTube. We would be thrilled to conduct AMAs with Bancor. We are connected to many KOLs and influencers who we’re sure would love to get involved with Bancor. We would put out announcements in the form of Twitter, Telegram, and Medium articles for every development in the partnership. \n\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1I1Nh2gWUjtmPG1fOvpQXIA8eGomq-1ojDvMuC19RSmQ/edit?usp=sharing",

      "title": "Proposal: Extend Snapshot voting indefinitely with anti-tampering contingency plan",
      "content": "### This proposal is expected to appear on Snapshot for voting on [date=2021-09-12 time=12:00:00 timezone=\"UTC\"]. Make sure to stake your vBNT for voting before this date and time to participate in the DAO decision.\n\n# TL;DR\n1. Gas fees for voting on Ethereum can be volatile and expensive; this issue gave rise to the highly successful integration of [gasless voting via Snapshot](https://gov.bancor.network/t/bip12-gasless-voting-via-snapshot/1017) to Bancor earlier this year. \n2. More must be done to ensure BancorDAO's resilience to a hypothetical instance of vote tampering on Snapshot.\n       a) Extend the use of gasless voting via Snapshot indefinitely, whilst preserving the BancorDAO's right to suspend its use at any time, and for any reason. \n       b) In an suspected instance of vote tampering on Snapshot, revert to on-chain voting on Ethereum (with gas fees) as the ultimate source of truth when determining the outcome of the governance proposal(s) in question.\n\n# Voting Instructions\n\nVote FOR to implement the proposed changes to the organization of Snapshot for BancorDAO governance.\n\nVote AGAINST to keep the voting system unchanged.\n\n\n# The proposal\n\nWhereas high gas fees were previously hindering activity in the BancorDAO governance, gasless voting via Snapshot has drastically improved voter turnout in recent months, such that reaching quorum on whitelisting and LM proposals has seldom since been an issue. \n\nSo crucial is Snapshot to Bancor's infrastructue that BancorDAO has consistently ranked as [one of the most active DAOs](https://twitter.com/DeepDAO_io/status/1427519631082754049) in recent months. Moreover, in addition to bolstering protection against double-voting, a crucial anti-spam measure was introduced as per [BIP12 ADDENDUM](https://gov.bancor.network/t/bip12-addendum-reorganization-of-dao-operations-on-snapshot/1467) requiring a 7-day lockup of vBNT staked in governance for voting, preventing against the risk of nefarious actors buying and staking vBNT specifically to influence the outcome of one particular proposal. \n\nThat said, more measures must be implemented to ensure that BancorDAO is able to promptly and justly resolve a suspected instance of vote tampering involving Snapshot in the future. As such, this post consists of the following proposals: \n\n*1. To extend the use of gasless voting via Snapshot indefinitely, whilst preserving the BancorDAO's right to suspend its use by vote at any time, and for any reason.* \n\n*2. In a suspected instance of vote tampering on Snapshot, revert to on-chain voting on Ethereum (with gas fees) as the ultimate source of truth when determining the outcome of the governance proposal(s) in question.*\n\n\n **How would we know if tampering has occurred on Snapshot?**\nOne example of this could be an unusually high voter turnout compared to previous votes, clearly not reflecting the true number of vBNT staked. This would obviously indicate that hackers have compromised the Snapshot system, allowing them to create governance proposals to their own benefit at the expense of the protocol's health. \n\nTaking an extreme hypothetical scenario, this could manifest itself in a proposal to whitelist a unknown token with an immediate LM program at 1000000% APY indefinitely. This proposal could then receive 100,000,000 vBNT votes in favor with a quorum of 100% and a 100% majority. \n\nAnother scenario that would indicate Snapshot having been hacked is failure to register votes in favor of/against a given proposal, generating an outcome that is not reflective of voters' wishes. \n\nGuidelines are proposed below on how community members should escalate a response to such occurrences where they suspect them.\n\n**Does the DAO need to have a vote on Ethereum to determine if Snapshot results should be ignored?** \nYes. The security of the governance process is paramount. As such, any vote to nullify the result of a vote on Snapshot would require a **66.7% majority and** **25% quorum.** This is a lower quorum threshold than for whitelisting proposals so as to reduce friction should swift action be required. Meanwhile, it is not too low as to encourage proposals to nullify the outcome of a vote on Snapshot without apparent good reason. \n\n**Who can initiate a vote to ignore the result(s) of Snapshot votes, and via what mechanism? Would this require front end support?**\nAnybody with 25,000 vBNT staked in Governance may initiate such a vote. However, in order for the voting community to be fully informed of the facts before voting, any community member wishing to submit such a proposal would be required to firstly create a forum post outlining their proposal on [gov.bancor.network](https://gov.bancor.network/) and await feedback from other community members *before* pushing the proposal to a vote. This forum post **must include evidence of suspected voter tampering**. Any vote initiated on Ethereum to nullify a vote on Snapshot without presenting evidence of suspected voter fraud and receiving feedback from other community members, will **not** be considered legitimate even if receives a 66.7% majority and 25% quorum, and **will thus be ignored**. \n\n**Does a vote on Ethereum to nullify one vote on Snapshot cause Snapshot voting to be suspended altogether?**\nYes. Should one vote be nullified on Snapshot due to suspected voter fraud, voting on Snapshot will be suspended altogether. The BancorDAO would then request a written update on security measures from the [Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/) team before considering a new vote on Ethereum to re-instate Snapshot voting.",

Other decentralized exchanges (Uniswap/Balancer/Sushiswap) have the fees set for .3% for the RLC-ETH pair. Even if we were to raise our fees, we would still be cheaper due to the ETH-BNT pair being at .05% at the moment since most swaps will happen via the ETH path ( ETH-->BNT-->RLC) for a total of .25% overall TX fees.\n\nCurrently, the RLC-ETH pair has good liquidity on some competing DEXes:\n\n![image|646x347](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/bancordao/original/2X/3/3de57b24e88abd0d5f8f2d7fb50f22afbd875068.png)\n\nbut we are the deepest as of ~2 days ago:\n\n![image|485x312](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/bancordao/original/2X/8/8410e62f7fab1c584d2321eb7365a385cb6ef8df.png)\n \nWe can't really go much higher in terms of fees since we are going to be pricing ourselves out as compared to the competition.\n\nNote that most trades at the moment of small amounts (less than 3 ETH, $9500) end up being routed via uniswap/sushiswap. We tend to capture larger trades due to gas cost in the two hop scenario making it cost prohibitive for smaller swaps (current NFT minting and opensea don't help either).",

Since 2017, the iExec project has been building a marketplace for cloud computing resources - servers, datasets, and applications. Anyone can buy and sell computing resources in exchange for the native iExec utility token ‘RLC’. Additional features of the iExec protocol allow for confidential computing, NFT asset tokenization of computing resources, secure decentralized oracles (secured using TEE), and much more!\n\n**The ‘RLC’ utility token:**\n\n‘RLC’ is the native token to iExec. RLC are ERC-20 standard tokens. The RLC is a utility token, used to buy and sell resources provided through iExec. On the iExec Marketplace, it is the sole method of payment between application providers, server providers and data providers. Anyone can earn RLC tokens by trading these computing resources on the iExec marketplace. As the iExec network is fully decentralized, no single agent is trusted by default, and that those agents require incentives to contribute correctly.The RLC token is ‘staked’ as a security deposit, in iExec’s consensus protocol ‘Proof-of-Contribution (PoCo)’ is the protocol used by iExec for consensus over off-chain computing.\n\n**Community and Communication**\n\nThe iExec team is active and interacts with the community on various discussion channels such as [Telegram](https://t.me/iexec_discussion), [Slac](https://slack.iex.ec/), [Kakao Talk](https://open.kakao.com/o/gKyp9Mw), WeChat.

Margin Swap lets you trade a wide range of tokens with up to 5x leverage.\n\nWhat you can do on Margin Swap:\n\n* Trade Uniswap and SushiSwap assets: Marginswap uses the liquidity from other AMMs. Trades can sometimes be routed through multiple AMMs, thereby arbitraging the connected trading routes' price differences.\n* Long or short any supported assets: Go long or short any asset on cross margin using supported assets as collateral.\n* Borrow supported assets: Take overcollateralized loans and open leverage positions with one account. You can deposit collateral and take a loan in one transaction!\n* Cross margin trading: In cross margin, your total account balance is factored in calculating the liquidation threshold. Meaning margin is shared across all open positions, not isolated to a single pair.\n* Spot trading: Marginswap aggregates prices from all connected dexes using the marginswapRouter at no extra cost.\n* Supply bond: Lend the protocol supported crypto assets and earn stable yield. Marginswap also rewards Lenders with the governance token $MFI\n\nCommunity and Communication\n\n* [Twitter](https://twitter.com/marginswap)\n* [Telegram](https://t.me/marginswap)\n\nAvailable Audits\n\nhttps://github.com/marginswap/audits\n\nMarginswap was audited by Certik and a competitive audit was also commissioned.\n\nMFI Price and Market Stats\n\n|MFI Price|$0.959189|\n| --- | --- |\n|Market Cap|$6,329,995|\n|Market Cap Dominance|0.00%|\n|Trading Volume|$694,713|\n|Volume / Market Cap|0.1093|\n|24h Low / 24h High|$0.859936 / $1.06|\n|7d Low / 7d High|$0.719707 / $1.96|\n|Market Cap Rank|#1277|\n\nBenefits for Bancor:\n\nMFI is currently trading on Uniswap, Pangolin and MEXC. If whitelisted on bancor, the increased arbitrage and price movement (up or down opportunity) will bring a lot of volume to the Pair on Bancor.\nWe will also be advertising this pool and I believe our community would also be very interested in supplying liquidity to this pair, taking advantage of IL protection and the fact that they only need to supply only MFI.\n\nAlso, we would explore adding BNT to cross margin trading, making it possible for BNT holders to lend, borrow and open leverage trades using BNT as collateral on Marginswap.\n\nWhen the MFI pool on Bancor is big enough, we will add MFI to our cross margin trading and add the pair on Bancor as the liquidation Path.",

Make sure to stake your vBNT for voting before this date and time to participate in the DAO decision.\n\n# TL;DR\n\n* This Proposal seeks to extend the LM Rewards on FARM to 100 days.\n* This should help Bancor target the 52 Million USD of single sided FARM liquidity currently deposited in Harvest’s profit sharing pool.\n* The FARM Community wants to further add to the pool but the time limit on the Rewards is making it difficult to coerce some into jumping in feet first with a 100 day commitment.\n* The FARM Team has already shown a great deal of commitment by putting up part of their treasury and also pointing the buyback mechanism towards Bancor.\n* The FARM Pair already sees very high native APYs from the raw amount of trading volume the pair generates, so much so that the BNT Rewards are less than the revenue it generates.\n\n# Motivations\n\nThe FARM Community is ecstatic about Bancor and that is clearly shown by the huge amount of support and revenue they’ve brought onto the platform. As mentioned above the FARM community wants greatly to stake their tokens with us but are taken aback by the 16 day timer (as of the time of writing this) on what is a 100 day commitment. Bancor can stand to gain magnitudes in terms of liquidity and volume from this while fortifying our relationship with one of the top farming protocols in the space. Another point worth noting here is that looking at the fees already gathered on the FARM Pair the LM has already paid for itself and then some. \n![|624x237](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/bancordao/optimized/2X/a/a127039d55a540bd45651397f52db3fbb26986cc_2_1248x474.png)\n\n![|624x235](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/bancordao/optimized/2X/8/8899d98079b83e3946f48e83922deae18d41a3d5_2_1248x470.png)\n\nWe know that single sided staking is a big hit for the FARM pair and at this point Bancor is already generating way more returns for FARM depositors. The problem lies in that past apys do not guarantee future ones and this acts as a deterrent for single sided deposit given the Harvest’s own profit sharing pool gives a comparable but more stable apy. By giving FARM LPs that have now seen the effectiveness of the pool a chance to jump in, Bancor is essentially targeting about 52 Million dollars worth of liquidity in the Harvest pool. Those 52 Million could theoretically translate to huge amounts of volume to Bancor.\n\n![|624x213](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/bancordao/optimized/2X/d/d830543dbc53089333f7b6f1c8f8001c2114a751_2_1248x426.jpeg)\n\n**FARM has Generated the second biggest amount of revenue for the protocol since the pools launch.** \n\n![|209x507](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/bancordao/original/2X/c/c4b166b195cc37251cb989047cd75f069d0a3449.png)\n\nThanks to @glenn for help with data queries.\n\nFOR - Increase FARM LM Duration to 100 Days.\n\nAGAINST - Do Nothing.",

It provides the main function of encrypting and decrypting information transmission and evolves around this function, integrating de-private social, borderless payment network, decentralized file storage and sharing, decentralized finance, and governance (DAO) to help users protect their privacy, data, assets and rights on traditional social networks such as Twitter, Facebook, etc.\n\n# Tokenomics\n$MASK is the native token of MaskDAO. The DAO is the owner of the Mask Ecosystem. $MASK holders are members of MaskDAO and possess ownership of the Mask Ecosystem through the DAO. As the native token, $MASK serves as incentives to facilitate governance. Each $MASK represents one vote. Overtime, Mask Network team and ecosystem members will develop more products and services that would accrue value to $MASK. Mask Network will continue to actively engage with top Web 3.0 and DeFi projects as we have done with MetaMask, Mirror, UniSwap, Pancakeswap, Transak, Coinmarketcap etc to expand use cases for $MASK.\n \n# Community and Communication\n* [Official Website](http://mask.io)\n* [Github](https://github.com/DimensionDev)\n* [Twitter](https://twitter.com/realmaskbook)\n* [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/masknetwork)\n* [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/cKGW45g)\n* [Telegram](https://discord.com/invite/cKGW45g)\n\n# Available Audits\n[SECBIT](https://pxmcr6lqb3qzyfb7hybmvw5wzm4p5it2seyzl5prgfxlblttjsua.arweave.net/fdgo-XAO4ZwUPz4Cytu2yzj-onqRMZX18TFusK5zTKg) (Feb 22, 2021)\n\n# Market and Trading Data\n* $MASK contract address: 0x69af81e73a73b40adf4f3d4223cd9b1ece623074\n* $MASK market cap: ~$115,200,000\n* $MASK holders: 6,660\n* [CoinGecko token link ](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/mask-network)\n* [Etherscan token link ](https://etherscan.io/token/0x69af81e73a73b40adf4f3d4223cd9b1ece623074#balances)\n* Links to Dex liquidity pool\n  * [Sushiswap](https://sushiswap.vision/token/0x69af81e73a73b40adf4f3d4223cd9b1ece623074)\n  * [Pancakeswap ](https://pancakeswap.info/token/0x2ed9a5c8c13b93955103b9a7c167b67ef4d568a3)\n  * [Uniswap V3](https://v3.info.uniswap.org/#/tokens/0x69af81e73a73b40adf4f3d4223cd9b1ece623074)\n* Available on Binance, OKEx, Huobi, Coinbase, Digifinex and other 30+ CEXs\n\n# Benefits for Bancor\n* Single Sided staking and no IL risk for long term LPs can make this MASK’s deepest AMM pool. That should result in impressive volume.\n* As of Sep 1 2021, according to Coingecko $MASK market cap is $115,200,000 and average 24hrs trading volume YTD is $66,719,022 with nearly 66 thousand holders. By adding $MASK as a collateral asset, Bancor will potentially increase TVL and generate more usage.\n\n* MASK Network has an active community with more than 41 thousand followers on Twitter that will be happy to support Bancor by promoting and marketing the utility of $MASK as a collateral on Bancor on social media.\n\n* Through Mask Network, users can directly view the price trend of tokens on CoinMarketCap or CoinGecko on Twitter and conduct transactions on Uniswap and Sushiswap by connecting their wallets. It is possible to seek the similar pattern of ecosystem cooperation between Bancor and MASK.\n\n* MASK Network is also starting a Social Defi Aliance that aims to help Defi get mass adoption from regular social network users. From the Wall Street Bet Revolution to Tik Tok investors to the ultra addictive Crypto Twitter, social and finance has proven to be more than a natural fit as we’ve seen from numerous examples. Mask hopes to do this along with Bancor and the rest of the Defi community.",

The INST token contracts do not have permissions that grant administrators unrestricted mint/burn capabilities. The INST token supply is fixed at 100,000,000, of which 17,823,239 are in current circulation. The contract with the highest concentration of INST token is the DAO’s Treasury which holds around 40% of the token supply; the other current large wallets represent the token vesting contracts for team, investors and future team. The other large wallets are primarily Uniswap v3 Liquidity. The team wallets and vesting contracts can be found by highlighting the question mark under Circulating Supply on CoinGecko [here](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/instadapp).\n\n# Project\n\nInstadapp is a DeFi middleware platform that empowers DeFi protocols with powerful tooling, with a focus on creating modular functionality, being developer friendly and enabling new use cases to DeFi. Instadapp is powered through its DeFi Smart Accounts, a non-custodial smart wallet that enables access to the Instadapp platform and functions. Instadapp empowers users by enabling one-click transactions, refinancing, collateral and debt swaps and other composable DeFi operations. In July 2021 Instadapp shifted the administration and upgradability of its contract to its INST token holders.\n\n# Tokenomics\n\nInstadapp’s native token, INST (ERC20), is a governance token for Instadapp community members to utilize in voting for the future of the protocol. To bootstrap the community, there was a retroactive airdrop for those who had positions within Instadapp and/or participated in DeFi either on Mainnet Ethereum or Polygon at snapshot block #12,644,000 and #15,773,000 respectively. Instadapp smart contract wallet users (DSA v.2) can earn INST by allocating funds to DeFi applications within the Instadapp protocol, these applications currently include MakerDAO, Compound, Aave V2. Another way to earn INST is by providing liquidity to the Uniswap V3 INST/ETH pool. Through these means of acquiring INST tokens, anyone has a fair and equal chance at acquiring a stake/voice in the future of the Instadapp protocol. In essence, the INST token is not just a governance token, but also a tool to incentivize user behavior.\n\n# Community and Communication\n\nInstadapp is active on[ Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Instadapp/),[ Telegram](https://t.me/instadapp),[ Discord](https://discord.com/invite/C76CeZc). The Instadapp team also operates official[ Twitter](https://twitter.com/instadapp) and[ YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCinS9sgInaP2iVt5TTaFB_g) accounts. Activity on[ GitHub](https://github.com/instadapp) is frequent, with new updates appearing every week or so. The Instadapp team is accessible primarily through communication channels such as the Discord link listed above.

      "content": "### This proposal is expected to appear on Snapshot for voting on [date=2021-09-05 time=12:00:00 timezone=\"UTC\"]. Make sure to stake your vBNT for voting before this date and time to participate in the DAO decision.\n\n**TLDR**\n\n* This proposal seeks to increase the Co-investment limit to 350K BNT for the **MONA** pool.\n* It will open up space for LPs on the TKN side (**MONA**) and increase the depth of the pool as LPs add liquidity\n* A larger **MONA** pool will attract more trades from aggregators and professional market makers to Bancor which ultimately leads to more fees for our platform.\n\n**For**\n\n1. A larger co-investment limit on the pool will let LPs provided single sided liquidity and will lead to an increase in pool depth\n2. More liquidity in the **MONA-BNT** pool should lead to larger volume from DEX aggregators and professional market makers sent in our direction\n3. More volume for Bancor leads to more fees for our platform and **BNT** holders\n\n**Against**\n\n1. We should not increase the limit on the pool.\n\n**Abstract**\nThere is currently **~161K BNT** and **~1K MONA** tokens in the BNT-MONA [pool](https://etherscan.io/address/0xF3d9Dc93C7015C223fc58c98116803b0cD4330E8). This has resulted in a pool that has roughly **~1.4M** in liquidity. At the moment, LPs on the TKN side (MONA) can’t provide single sided liquidity since there is no capacity. This proposal is seeking to increase single-sided capacity in the MONA pool by increasing the Co-investment limit to **350K BNT** .\n\n![image|485x303](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/bancordao/original/2X/d/de3114f724d4dc0118c1b9591977222328e6c0f6.png)\n\n**Motivation**\n\nIf we want to attract more MONA LPs to Bancor, we need to open up space in the pool so that they can provide single sided liquidity. This would allow us to grow the liquidity in the pool and attract larger trades towards our platform which ultimately results in higher fees for Bancor. The MONA pool went live on 8/12 and filled up completely since then (less than 24 hours after launching):\n\n![image](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/bancordao/original/2X/c/c7c6a934873d07b87e6ef00470208e23030ccd3f.png)\n\nNote: Data is grouped weekly and 8/12 was the week of 8/9\n\nThis suggest to me that there is large demand for LPs on the MONA side to provide liquidity and we should open up space.\n\nThe top pool for MONA is on Uniswap V2 and it is paired with ETH. Pool depth is roughly **~1.5M** and we should be able to make the Bancor pool deeper to support larger trades with low price impact:\n\n![image](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/bancordao/original/2X/7/72b8118a95e2860d67bed900c2389401192097c7.png)\n\nCurrently, the Bancor pool has no space and LPs can’t provide single sided liquidity on the TKN side (MONA). I am proposing a **350K** (a **200K** increase from the initial **150K** ) Co-investment limit for the MONA pool which should open up roughly **800K** in additional single sided liquidity (assuming BNT price at $4.00). If this pools fills up completely, we would have a pool that’s roughly **~3M** in depth and outsize the UNI.",

Other users can then purchase a coverage policy to “insure” themselves against hacks, rugpools, or exploits that result in a permanent loss of funds.\n\nBridge is fully permissionless, anyone can create a Coverage Pool for any protocol. The mission of Bridge is to become a fully DAO governed protocol in the near future.\n\n# Tokenomics\n\nCurrently, BMI is utilizing a fair launch approach, distributing tokens to liquidity providers over the next 2-3 years.\n\nThe BMI token can be used to vote on the outcomes of claims; the more tokens you have, the more influence you have on whether, and how much, the protocol will pay out to successful claimants. Voting power is also influenced by the protocol’s reputation system, everyone earns or loses reputation on the same scale.\n\nIn the near future, Bridge Mutual plans relinquish full control to its DAO structure where the BMI token will be used to vote on network changes and upgrades.\n\nAfter the DAO is introduced, one of the main network upgrades that the community has been very vocal about is the token buyback and redistribution/burn of tokens (subject to community discussion).\n\n# Community and Communication\n\nTwitter - https://twitter.com/Bridge_Mutual (41K followers)\n\nMedium - https://bridgemutual.medium.com/\n\nDiscord - [discord.gg/bmi](https://t.co/bS9snlOsDo?amp=1)\n\nTelegram - https://t.me/bridge_mutual (27K active users)\n\n# Available Audits\n\nBridge has been audited two times by reputable auditors:\n\n* [Zokyo](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5fac3e348dbd5932a7578690/60da267d76850e5acfe4e4c2_Bridge%20Mutual%20SC%20Audit_%20ZOkyo.pdf)\n* Consensys (link unavailable)\n\nBridge also has an open bounty:\n\n* [Immunefi](https://immunefi.com/bounty/bridgemutual/)\n\n# Benefits for Bancor:\n\nBridge Mutual community is planning to implement buybacks immediate after the DAO launches, this process can be handled on Bancor network.\n\nMoreover, Bridge Mutual currently provides coverage against protocol hacks and exploits on Bancor, there is currently over $1M in available coverage for Bancor Network, and over $30M in coverage across all covered protocols.\n\nUsers who are confident that Bancor is a safe protocol can earn up to 100% APY in BMI tokens in exchange for insuring Bancor Network.",

      "title": "Bancor Improvement Proposal ETH/BNT Fee to 0.05%",
      "content": "**Bancor Improvement Proposal ETH/BNT Fee to 0.05%**\n\n\n## This proposal is expected to appear on Snapshot for voting on Saturday 28th August 2021 at 4:00 pm UTC. Make sure to stake your vBNT for voting BEFORE this date and time to participate in the DAO decision. \n## The effect will be active on 1st September ##\n\n\n**TL:DR**\n\n* Without testing, nobody knows the optimal fee for the ETH/BNT pool.\n* The fee has been at 0.1% for a long period of time and data on performance already exists for that time period. A higher fee of 0.15% has been reverted.\n* This proposal suggests a fee decrease to 0.05% in order to evaluate any changes in volume, fees generated, vBNT burned and fees/TVL of **all pools**\n\n**Current Fee**\n\nThe 0.1% fee associated with the ETH/BNT pool has been static for a long period of time. Certainly long enough for a wealth of data on:\n\n* Volume\n* Fees\n* vBNT\n* Fees/TVL\n\nNow that we have a baseline measurement, this proposal suggests that we decrease the fee by a very modest 0.05% in order to monitor the consequences on the measures above.\n\nIf this performance of the protocol improves, a future proposal could suggest a further decrease to zero. If performance sufferers, a future proposal could suggest a increase in the fee.\n\n**A Philosophical Argument**\n\nThe Bancor Protocol has many parameters that can be adjusted in order to fine-tune its economics. Another such example would be the Vortex Fee.\n\nThis proposal argues that in the rapidly changing world of DeFi and AMMs, we should actively be experimenting with and testing these parameters in order to consistently improve the performance of the protocol over time. This approach is similar to Toyota’s Kaizen philosophy.\n\nTo quote the great Mr Dylan, “he who is not busy being born is busy dying”.\n\n**A Rational Argument**\n\n![ethVol|690x118](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/bancordao/optimized/2X/a/a459a35f4410cbc40943faa27c2605ba4f4adc42_2_1380x236.jpeg)\n\nThe BNT / ETH pool has the most volume as shown above. This means most trades are ETH / TKN to enter the bancor ecosystem. Best case would be to attract more volume to bancor by further lowering the fees to 0.05%. If overall volume goes up but the ETH pools performance is worse than before bancor should consider compensating the ETH pool. Basically this means to subsidize the ETH pool in order to gain more volume. If this is succesful zero fees should be considered aswell.\n\n\n**Timing is essential**\n\nThe increase to 0.15% had a bad timing. It was impl. at the top in May and was rolled back at the bottom in July\n![eth|690x333](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/bancordao/original/2X/a/a20a58deda355f364dbba3244b139eb0dd006f77.jpeg)\n\nDue to bitcoins seasonality, as shown below, the fee should be lowered on September 1st and evaluated on November 1st. \n![BTC_Seasonal|540x500](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/bancordao/original/2X/f/f102941fb121ed33e9cea3a4fa0dafb7c2bd8796.jpeg)\n\n**Measure success**\n\nThere are several ways to measure success but trade count is probably the best we have. A lot of variables affect the total trades, including market volatility, gas fees, news hype, etc.\nIf we take the weekly moving average of total trades we should be able to calculate if an increase in trades is related to lower fees or overall market conditions.\n![tradecount|690x241](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/bancordao/original/2X/0/034536b693e19be9502efdb46b656b03306be54f.jpeg)\n\nThe proposal is a success if the average weekly trade count goes up more or goes down less than expected. Voting should start on the 29th of August\n\n**What happens after November 1st**\n\nIf it was a success a follow up proposal will be created to set fees to 0% and add permanent BNT rewards for the ETH pool. Aiming for 5-10% APR.\n\nIf it failed fees will be reset to 0.1%\n\n\n**Voting Instructions**\n\nTo support changing the fee to 0.05%, vote FOR\n\nTo oppose changing the fee, vote AGAINST",

      "content": "To be pushed to Snpashot on Sunday Aug 29\n\n**TLDR**\n\n* This proposal seeks to increase the Co-investment limit to 500K BNT in the ERSDL pool.\n* The eRSDL LP which was approved overwhelmingly with an initial Co-Investment of 100K was an immediate success with the UnFederal Reserve community members. The LP filled within hours of launch and sits now at over 800K in liquidity.\n* Many eRSDL community members have expressed disappointment that they didn’t have the opportunity to get into the LP and would like to if more space is available.\n* UNI is the largest LP currently for eRSDL, as well as the highest volume DEX. Making this additional Co-Investment would enable more community members to stake their eRSDL and promote Bancor as the go to DEX for swaps and trades. Furthermore, I believe increasing the co-investment will quickly result in matching eRSDL token staking to make Bancor the deepest pool available for eRSDL.\n* I am in touch with the team, and community, and am confident this increase would lead to much more exposure to Bancor in the form of promotion, swaps and BNT holders as more choose to learn and see the opportunity.\n\n**For**\n\n1. Increase Co-Investment to 500K BNT\n\n**Against**\n\n1. Make no change\n\n**Abstract**\nThere is currently 100K BNT and 1.5M eRSDL tokens in the BNT- eRSDL pool. This has resulted in a pool that has roughly 800K in liquidity. At the moment, LPs on the TKN side (eRSDL) can’t provide single sided liquidity since there is no capacity. This proposal is seeking to increase single-sided capacity in the eRSDL pool by increasing the Co-investment limit to 500K BNT.",

Protect users from malicious MEV (frontrunning, sandwich attacks, etc.) and reduce the\nnegative externalities MEV has on Ethereum\n2. Improve earnings for block producers and increase consensus-level security against block\nreorganization\n3. Tokenize access to MEV, and redistribute value to network stakeholders\n\n# Tokenomics\nTraders - stake EDEN to gain access to Eden RPC to protect and prioritize their transactions. The more EDEN staked, the better block positioning traders secure.\n\nSlot tenants - bid EDEN to secure prime block space within Ethereum blocks which is then burnt. There are three slots on a perpetual auction system.\n\nBlock producers - rewarded in EDEN for mining Eden Network blocks. In return they provide priority block space for Traders and Slot Tenants.\n\nLiquidity providers - get EDEN rewards in return for providing liquidity. Eden Network allocates a portion of newly minted EDEN for LP incentives.\n\n\n# Community and Communication\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/edennetwork\nTelegram: https://t.me/archerdao\nMedium: https://medium.com/edennetwork\nDiscord: https://discord.com/invite/NapqcSpeS4\n\n\n# Market and Trading Data\nDaily trading volume as of 20 August 2021 is 18,470,720 - 95% of liquidity is on SushiSwap.\n\n# Additional Information\nBancor has tried the services of Eden Network and is satisfied with the delivery. The tweet below shows Bancor and SushiSwap giving their users the top Ethereum block space utilising Eden Network.\n\nEden Network is a working partner with Bancor on MEV protection\n\nhttps://twitter.com/EdenNetwork/status/1423603721599168518\n\nEden Network is currently processing ~50% of the Ethereum hashrate - almost 1 in 2 blocks on Ethereum are now Eden blocks.\n\n![image|623x500](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/bancordao/original/2X/3/3bfcb77a0285e702c9535f8db40076dc2ac3eea5.jpeg)",

The POWR contract does not have permissions that grant administrators mint/burn capabilities; it is a standard implementation of ERC20 with no upgradeability meaning tokens can never be frozen.\n\nThe POWR token supply is fixed at 1,000,000,000, of which about half (500,000,000) are in current circulation. The addresses with the highest concentration of POWR tokens are predominantly the Power Ledger treasury, exchange wallets, and founding team wallets. All POWR tokens have fully vested since the ICO in October 2017.  \n\nPOWR holdings are well distributed across 51,000+ addresses.\n\n**# Projects and Clients**\n\nPower Ledger provides applications for green energy transition, including energy trading for energy communities, energy sharing plans, frequency markets, and environmental certificates trading.\n\nOur customers are energy participants, including energy utilities, energy generators, energy communities, and certificate buyers and sellers. Due to the massive transition occurring in the energy sector towards decentralization, Power Ledger serves a clear purpose now and in the future. More information about our projects is available here - https://www.powerledger.io/clients\n\nPower Ledger has 20+ enterprise customers in 9+ countries, and an international team of 40+ staff.\n\n**# Tokenomics**\n\nPower Ledger token, POWR (ERC20), is required to access the suite of Power Ledger applications. Therefore, POWR is a utility token, and not merely a symbolic representation of the project.\n\n**# Community and Communication**\n\nPower Ledger is active on Telegram, Medium, LinkedIn and Twitter.\n\nThe leadership and business development team are presented on Power Ledger website https://www.powerledger.io/company/about\n\nPower Ledger office is located at Level 2, The Palace, 108 St George’s Terrace, Perth, WA, Australia, 6000\n\nsales@powerledger.io\n\n**# Market and Trading Data**\n\n* CMC price at the time of writing is $0.29\n* All-time high: $2.01 (4 Jan 2018)\n* All-time low: $0.03 (13 March 2020)\n* 0.5 billion tokens in circulation\n* 1,000,000,000 maximum supply.\n* The current market capitalization is $127M.\n* The token is available on major exchanges, including Binance, Bithumb, Uniswap 3 pools ($1.34M pool POWR/ETH), Bittrex, Huobi, SushiSwap.\n* Uniswap has 3 pools with the largest pool in excess of $1.34M.  Bancor pool could rival that in size. \n\n**Benefits for Bancor**\n\nPower Ledger has an active community of POWR token holders who will be joining Bancor, some for the first time, and bringing in additional trading volume, marketing the existence of the pool. Power Ledger is supporting this pool to become one of the biggest ones in terms of liquidity and will be contributing 1,000,000 POWR straight away, and potentially more overtime.",

The team is creating a safe-harbor DeFI banking ecosystem targeting small to mid-sized US Treasury chartered banks and non-bank lenders. Bonded participants, full due diligence, community-approved counterparties, fully KYC/AML/BSA compliant and housed within a US 273 bank, [IFEB.bank](https://ifeb.bank). Our goal is to offer faster settlements, higher deposit rates, and lower borrowing rates.\n\nIn traditional financial markets, B2B lenders are penalized for cash that not only arrives late but as well if it arrives early. eRSDL’s solution to this is a low-latency platform that allows B2B lenders to borrow and lend short term between themselves, putting their cash to work on moderate interest rates and benefitting from those moderate interest rates when they borrow.\n\nOur First product is a DeFi lending product similar to that of Compound with 65 million TVL in supply right now which is the 12th highest TVL as compared to [DeFiPulse](https://www.defipulse.com):\n\nhttps://lending.unfederalreserve.com/\n\nKey Advisors:\n\n[Martine Niejadlik](https://unfederalreserve.medium.com/meet-our-advisor-martine-niejadlik-efdb3319cedf) Ex-COO Coinbase\n[Ralph Fatigate](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ralph-fatigate-573a253/): Advisor who designed compliance at Coinbase / Venmo\n\n[Nicholas D'Angelo](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nicholascdangelo/): Former SVP & Chief of Staff of Wells Fargo\n\n# Tokenomics\n\neRSDL itself is a utility token that represents the licensing fee and licensure to use unFed's banking products. The idea is that a portion of the borrowing costs will be passed through to unFederalReserve, where we purchase eRSDL from the market on the borrower's behalf. That amount gets held as the licensing fee. Mechanics on the fee amount, time, what to do with the token, etc. to follow via community discourse, research and voting. For non-B2B-participants, it will also provide governance rights to token holders who will vote to determine the design, development, and future of this project. eRSDL is not a security nor is it registered with the SEC. As such, none of the material presented here is an offer to purchase or sell securities. Info in this channel also contains forward-looking statements. The team is focused on maximizing the utility of the token and there can be no guarantee of any return on the purchase of the eRSDL tokens.\n\n# Community and Communication\n\nunFederalReserve is active on [Telegram](https://t.me/unfedres_staking), [Discord,](https://discord.gg/unfederalreserve) [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/unFederalReserve), and [Medium](https://unfederalreserve.medium.com/). The unFederalReserve team also operates official [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Unfederalreser1), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/unfederalreserve), and [YouTube](https://youtube.com/c/unfederalreserve?sub_confirmation=1) accounts. Activity on [GitHub](https://github.com/UnFederalReserve/community/issues) is frequent, with new updates appearing every 2–3 days. The development team and advisors are presented on the [team tab](https://www.unfederalreserve.com/team) on the unFederalReserve website. Howard Krieger, the co-founder and CEO , is the project’s main spokesperson with 20 years in the financial industry. unFederalReserve can be contacted via the appropriate channels:\n\n* Mailing, 228 Park Ave S PMB 96932, New York, NY 10003\n* Security email, [security@unfederalreserve.com](mailto:security@unfederalreserve.com)\n* Technical support email, [info@unfederalreserve.com](mailto:info@unfederalreserve.com) and Github Board: https://github.com/UnFederalReserve/community\n* Press email, [info@unfederalreserve.com](mailto:info@unfederalreserve.com)\n\n# Available Audits\n\neRSDL and ReserveLending DeFi Lending Platform has been audited at least 2 times since 2020, by reputable auditors:\n\n* https://unfederalreserve.medium.com/unfederalreserve-and-the-first-key-safety-c6503ee0cda7\n\n# Market and Trading Data\n\n* https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/unfederalreserve\n\nBenefits for Bancor:\n\nSingle sided LP staking would be very attractive to our eRSDL holders driving more token utility. They can extract additional value from eRSDL by still holding their tokens and earn fees outside of the APY in reserve lending that is very low right now. We feel this value add will bring a large % of our 13k holders to try out Bancor for this feature alone.\n\nThe Impermanent loss protection also protects users and will also promote holding their tokens for a longer period of time to get the insurance. This feature as well will attract our community to the Bancor platform growing the Bancor user base accordingly. We have many Twitter influencers as well who would also share this exciting news extending the reach beyond just the eRSDL holders.\n\nExample of how strong our social trends can be that can be put to use for the Bancor announcement:\n\nhttps://twitter.com/lunarcrush/status/1428116027649323011\n\nWe have a very good medium blog here and will post a Bancor article on its benefits upon launch to our 13k holders and 15k twitter followers further explaining the benefits of the platform.\n\nBlog: https://unfederalreserve.medium.com/\n\n# Voter Incentives\n\n3 lucky randomly selected voters will get a special Swag gift from our online Merch Store!",

The DeXe Network contracts do not have permissions that grant administrators unrestricted mint/burn capabilities. The DEXE token supply is fixed at 96,504,599, of which 3,384,373 are in current circulation. The contracts and addresses with the highest concentration of DEXE tokens are predominantly, DeXe token contract wallet, two of the Binance wallets, and earlier investors wallets.

It eliminates the risks of transferring digital wallet details such as private keys and API or any virtual currency data to a third party. Most importantly, the DeXe Network connects successful traders and followers in a transparent, verifiable way for the benefit of both groups\n\n# Tokenomics\n\nDeXe Network’s native token, DEXE (ERC20), is required to access the Dexe Network Investment platform. The platform will work based on the principles of a DAO and so all the key decisions will be made by DEXE token holders. All token holders will be able to participate in the voting on the following:\n\n1) The time-frame and adjustment of the percentage of tokens burned\n2) The quantity of rewards received for farming (increase or decrease the % of accrual)\n3) Burning tokens and gathering awards for farming\n4) Systems for insuring user funds by putting tokens on DEX\n5) Insuring funds on the platform. Ability to get up to 100% of your starting deposit compensated in case of a losing trade\n\n# Community and Communication\n\nDeXe Network is active on [Medium](https://dexenetwork.medium.com/), [Telegram](https://t.me/Dexe_network), [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/dexe.network), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/dexe-network/), [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/dexenetwork/), and [Discord](https://discord.gg/6TBdx6jr). \nVarious interesting activities are constantly being held in cooperation with renowned projects like Binance (for example) that certainly benefit all the sides. \nAlso, DeXe Network preparing the [AirDrop program](https://dexenetwork.medium.com/introducing-111pg-new-dexe-ecosystem-product-the-sniping-bot-killer-51974c2a8997#:~:text=Since%20111PG%20is,not%20miss%20anything) based on the projects [111PG](https://111pg.io/) defends (one of our ecosystem products).\n\n# Available Audits\n\nDeXe Network has been audited by Hacken in September 2020:\n\n* [Smart Contract Code Review and Security Analysis Report, Hacken](https://dexe.network/Dexe_SC_Audit_Report.pdf)\n\n# Market and Trading Data\n\n* Chainlink’s price at the time of writing is $11.08\n* All-time high: $36.57 (14th March 2021)\n* All-time low: $0.6828 (14th November 2020)\n* Price 90 days ago: $15.08\n* 3,384,373 tokens in circulation\n* 96,504,599 maximum supply\n* The current market capitalization is $37,838,955.\n* The DEXE token is available on such exchanges as Binance, Gate, Uniswap, PancakeSwap, MXC, Bitcoin.com, WazirX, and others\n* The 24-hour volumes range from $211,950 (PancakeSwap) to $4,094,185 (Binance)\n\nBenefits for Bancor:\n\n🚀 DeXe Network will add Bancor as a supported decentralized exchange on the DeXe Investment Platform (Social trading platform), so traders will have an opportunity to trade through Bancor.

Over the past few months, the relationship has strengthened, which has translated to a huge increase in the ZCN/BNT pool size (see above). This migration of 0Chainers from Uniswap to the Bancor pool has allowed ample space for Bancor to absorb majority of the total DEX liquidity, while maintaining a substantive incentive for ZCN LPs to buy and stake BNT. The response from BNT LPs has been tremendously warm and rewards have been equally profitable for both communities. Not to mention the amount of BNT that has been taken out of circulation, the impact will be directed on BNT price, ensuring the DAO that ZCN is not inflationary.\n\n**![|624x71](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/bancordao/optimized/2X/9/9a9493cc6d3ec0a0573cc249eb2385c803223a6a_2_1248x142.png)**\n\n2 - With liquidity sitting at a remarkable ~$9,000,000, and current mining reward scheduled to end in 6 days, the extension of the liquidity mining program will maintain liquidity in the short term, while also supporting Bancor as it prepares migrations to v3. 0Chain would be delighted to support liquidity mining on v3 as well with 0Chain LM rewards, and certainly both communities will be welcoming it.\n\n3 - Not only did we see Bancor network become ZCN’s go-to decentralized exchange and liquidity resource, but we will also see an exciting collaboration of our technologies. With 0Chain’s distributed Cloud storage solution and Bancor's innovative liquidity solution, together will bring forth new & important innovations into the world. In this manner, 0Chain is working on a wallet build that will use Bancor Liquidity Pools for Swaps. This will be done directly without contracts, with our SDK, or via API.\n\nWith firm belief, the extension of the LMR program on ZCN/BNT will continue to provide us with constant liquidity, as part of the long-term support for our project, and a friendly environment for Bancor LPs. BNT has become an integral part of 0Chain, and together the communities have formed new and lasting synergies, we would like to go deeper into the vortex, and continue to expand at warpspeed. The value proposition of BNT is clear!",

(See below for analytics)\n* 250,000 BNT Co-investment from the DAO to incentivize liquidity from SFI holders/stakers and work to beat the Sushi Swap & Uniswap V2 pool on trade volume (14,478 SFI holders)\n* Saffron Finance has uniquely positioned itself as the premier asset collateralization & risk tranching protocol in DeFi, has built a powerful, intuitive community, and has attracted the attention of some of DeFi & TradFi’s greatest minds (mentioned by Wharton Business School & World Economic Forum) - and is well poised to capture significant market share of the risk-tranching niche of DeFi.\n* V2 is currently Saffron’s highest priority, and is currently being audited, will be rolled out with many new features such as perpetual staking, additional stablecoin offerings, expansion of the protocol into Solana, and more… Prior to V2, Saffron has just deployed to Polygon, an extremely exciting time for the project, and a massive opportunity to become the deepest source of liquidity for the SFI token.\n\n**Project Site**: New UI -> [https://beta.saffron.finance](https://beta.saffron.finance)/\n\n**Contract address**: [0xb753428af26e81097e7fd17f40c88aaa3e04902c](https://etherscan.io/token/0xb753428af26e81097e7fd17f40c88aaa3e04902c)\n\n**Token Security**\n\nThe SFI token is capped at 100,000 and is generated every 2 weeks during the wind down of an epoch. Tokens are earned by LPs proportional to how many dollars per second (dsec) they provided to the system for the duration of an epoch. SFI token subsidy is halved every epoch until epoch 8. From that point on, the system steadily releases 200 SFI tokens per epoch, until reaching the 100,000 cap. Currently, there are 91,640 SFI in circulation. SFI tokens that are staked and assets that are deposited into the protocol cannot withdraw until the end of an Epoch, which is 2 weeks in length, as it allows interest earned to be allocated more accurately between tranches and also ensures that senior tranches are insured. Upon V2 release, while there will still be a lock up time, SFI stakers and liquidity providers will not have to stake and unstake again at the end of every Epoch. Instead it will be done automatically by the protocol.\n\nThe token has never been exploited, even though Saffron’s contracts are currently unaudited, this is being worked on aggressively. The Saffron contracts do not grant permission to any one team member to execute a mint/burn function.\n\n![SFI Circulating Supply|512x252](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/bancordao/original/2X/9/9cd255dfeba69c2b44b202921de1fd3944bceeb8.png)\n\n\n**Project**\n\nSaffron is an asset collateralization platform where liquidity providers have access to dynamic exposure by selecting customized risk and return profiles via the use of SFI pool tranches. Existing decentralized earning platforms expose liquidity providers to complex code driven outcomes (bugs, smart contract failures, exploits, etc) - Network participants must evaluate an array of catastrophic scenarios where the resulting state could wipe out their holdings or lead to significant impermanent loss. It is hard to anticipate the net effect of extreme market volatility or focused economic attacks. Saffron narrows the set of possible outcomes by giving liquidity providers dynamic exposure.\n\nLaunched in October 2020 by pseudonymous founder \"Psykeeper\", the protocol's main use case is to act as an intermediary between liquidity providers and lending protocols, where liquidity providers can provide liquidity to lending protocols through various SFI tranches.\n\nThe protocol currently offers 3 tranches for liquidity providers:\n\n**Liquidity Balancing S tranche,**\n\n**Yield Enhanced A tranche,**\n\n**Risk Mitigated AA tranche,**\n\nWhile returns of the A tranche can be meaningfully higher than the AA tranche, in exchange for enhanced return, participants of the A tranche must stake Saffron’s native tokens (SFI) to mitigate against failures on the underlying lending platforms (i.e. Compound or Aave).\n\nIn the event of a failure of an underlying lending platform, liquidity providers in the riskier tranches will be in a position of first loss, while liquidity providers in more senior tranches are effectively insured.

Between Uniswap V2 and Sushiswap, SFI LP’s have earned a combined $6k in fees today, while maintaining quite handsome Liquidity-Volume ratios. Here’s the catch, while SFI token holders have enjoyed a nice return as the token has recently rallied, there is >18% suffered in impermanent loss, which might or might not be/have been realized. This alone is enough to incentivize at least 30-50% of the liquidity sitting in Sushiswap & Uniswap V2 to move to Bancor over the next 90 days. With a co-investment of 250,000 BNT (~$965,000) we will already have close to 50% of the liquidity Sushiswap has, and will be able to firmly make our way to becoming the default platform for SFI holders/LP’s to safely store & grow their assets. (Uniswap = Vertical, Sushiswap = Horizontal)\n\n![SFI Uniswap Analytics|379x500](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/bancordao/optimized/2X/0/0ce5425fc3b66fa31c98e8d44489050d9312e7fc_2_379x500.png)\n![SFI Sushiswap Analytics|512x221](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/bancordao/original/2X/5/571862172508099883e82e49eb9dc531d6693c7d.png)\n![SFI IL Data (Sushiswap)|512x43](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/bancordao/original/2X/8/88d26bb72f12b4ec6eaebbcf1bc73a94d05d6fe8.png)\n\n\n**Saffron Finance Market Data**\n\n** SFI Price: $1,115*\n** Price Change 24hr: +18.1%*\n** 24hr low / high: $932 / $1,117*\n** Trading Volume 24hr: $3.3m*\n** TVL: $28m*\n** Market Cap: $89.1m*\n** All Time High: $3,496*\n** All Time Low: $41*\n\n**Community & Communication**\n\n[Twitter: https://twitter.com/saffronfinance_](https://twitter.com/saffronfinance_)\n\n[Discord: https://discord.gg/xmbjjpd9](https://discord.gg/xmbjjpd9)\n\n[Github: https://github.com/saffron-finance/saffron](https://github.com/saffron-finance/saffron)\n\n[Forum: https://gov.saffron.finance/](https://gov.saffron.finance/)\n\n[Official Docs: https://beta.saffron.finance/docs](https://beta.saffron.finance/docs)\n\n[Medium: https://medium.com/saffron-finance](https://medium.com/saffron-finance)\n\n**Security Audit**\n\n* Pending V2 Launch for Smart Contract Audits (currently underway)\n\n**Benefits for Bancor & Saffron Finance**\n\n* Bringing SFI holders & LP’s deeper liquidity via the Bancor Network will allow Bancor to tap into a protocol that is poised to take advantage of retail/TradFi mania as far as DeFi is concerned, the goal is, that by the time this happens, for Bancor to be the deepest source of SFI liquidity across all of DeFi. SFI stakers will be pleased to know that instead of providing (dual-sided) liquidity with their token(s), they can now come to Bancor, deposit strictly SFI if they’d like (can also deposit BNT too, if they choose!) Saffron has certainly begun picking up massive traction/attention. Bancor can tap into this by essentially becoming an octopus, pulling in another highly liquid project like Saffron, and providing a superior liquidity provisioning experience to its holders/traders. It is a wholesome game for all parties.\n* The whitelisting of SFI would allow Bancor to tap into Saffron’s passionate, strong, fast-growing community. Saffron will (if not already) attract the largest minds in DeFi, and vice versa, Saffron to tap into Bancor’s extremely developed community and grow in many ways that benefits their own community outside of the fact that SFI holders/LP’s would now have the ability to not suffer IL while acting the way they’d like in the DeFi world. (Providing liquidity)\n* Saffron has made the transition to moving to formal governance recently, now having an active forum and utilizing Snapshot for voting, which Bancor DAO participants are very familiar with. Saffron has already greatly matured since its release in October of 2020, and “fits the bill” as far as being a very unique project worth whitelisting to Bancor, and making great effort to shift liquidity away from Uniswap V2 and Sushiswap. I believe that with the incentives we can offer SFI holders and LP’s, they will come, and stay, in order to protect their yield, as well as grow, and trade their assets.\n\nProposal created by [@_krris](https://twitter.com/_krris).\n\nThank you for your consideration and time.",

Both these are somewhat dependent on v3.\n> * BNT is listed on our network and we will be connecting to more institutions and exchanges, bringing BNT liquidity support to them.\n\n\n## Justification\n1. The pool has one of the deepest liquidity in any CEX/DEX. Keeping the LM rewards active will help maintain its liquidity ahead of v3.\n2. The WOO/BNT pool has consistently been a top performer when taking into account the last 30, 60 and 90 days of volume. \n3. The synergy between Bancor and Wootrade cannot be overlooked and an extension of the LM rewards alongside the Wootrade team's promises to bring WOO LM rewards and explore other ways of adding value to Bancor would bring this partnership one step further.\n4. Utilising BNT LM rewards as a tool to build/incentivise mutually beneficial relationships with other projects is arguably one of the best use cases for it, as can be seen from the Harvest Finance buyback mechanism migration success [1].\n\nFOR \nExtend LM rewards on the WOO/BNT pool.\n\nAGAINST\nDo NOT extend LM rewards on the WOO/BNT pool.\n\n[1] https://gov.bancor.network/t/proposal-targeted-lm-campaign-for-farm-to-capture-buyback-mechanism/2556",

Make sure to stake your vBNT for voting before this date and time to participate in the DAO decision.\n\nProposal: \nTo continue Alpha LM rewards for another 12 weeks\n\nWhy not?\nLM is expensive and we have continued them for Alpha once already.\n\nBut why? \n1. Bancor has the deepest liquidity pool for Alpha out of any DEX - keeping this is beneficial for all Bancor Stakers \n\n2. Alpha Tokenomics (native staking of Alpha) is providing APY to stakers of 7%-12%. Bancor Fees are roughly 3-10%. Bancor, with additional LM rewards + Fee's provided to stakers provides a much superior APY of over 20%. This means Bancor, with some marketing, can in fact drive more users to stake Alpha on Bancor compared to any other single sided staking in the market.   \n\n3. Alpha Pool on Bancor has generated 585,936.87USD in fees in 128 days to Bancor (broken down in months as / March 116,816.4USD / April 170,484.3USD / May 190,905.8USD / June 49,272.21USD / 58,458.15USD) or 4,577.63USD per day. This is easily one of the top performing pools on Bancor and will continue to be. \n\nI have personally been staking Alpha, along with many other tokens on Bancor and continue to restake BNT consistently. Again, I understand this is quite early but believe keeping Bancor with the deepest liquidity pool for Alpha on any DEX while driving fee revenue to the protocol is key.  As an Alpha community member and Bancor fanatic (and hodler), would like to express our sincere gratitude towards the team and community members. Keep up the good work and hope you consider this proposal in due time!",

      "content": "**This proposal is expected to appear on Snapshot for voting on August 15, 2021 8:00 AM EST. Make sure to stake your vBNT for voting before this date and time to participate in the DAO decision.**\n\n**TL;DR**\n\n* Increase ICHI co-investment to 700k BNT from 350k BNT\n* Lower ICHI trading fee to 0.3%\n\n**Background**\n\n[ICHI was whitelisted on April 26th, 2021](https://vote.bancor.network/#/bancornetwork.eth/proposal/Qmc1xBSwD4h2wLEQ5RhKSBUNmXQehirYfA9Vvk4xR6kaNA) with an overwhelming response of 51% quorum and 97.41% for votes. I[CHI coinvestment was increased to 350k BNT](https://snapshot.org/#/bancornetwork.eth/proposal/Qma497eAYu2j5QaaXkHZQFgXsMZjUQ5pEvcSE9rGv1o2WD) on June 10, 2021 with 54% quorum and 99.85% for votes.\n\nSoon after, ICHI launched V2 of its platform which has supported stablecoins for the 1inch, Filecoin, Fuse, and 88MPH communities. ICHI’s oneToken Factory, audited by Quantstamp and Solidified, deployed a Decentralized Monetary Authority (DMA) for each community stablecoin with a total of $30M TVL supported by the system.\n\nICHI plans to create and bootstrap a oneBNT (stablecoin minted with BNT) for the Bancor community as soon as Bancor announces the availability of shadow tokens.\n\n**Fee Decrease Justification**\n\nThe ICHI fee was increased from 0.2% to 1% in the June 10th proposal as an experiment. This resulted in a 80-90% decrease in Bancor trading volume and a lower APR for the pool. In short, the experiment failed to increase total trading fees. As a next step, we should lower the fee to be more competitive with Sushiswap, 1INCH, and Uniswap by lowering the fee to 0.3%. This is still 50% higher than the original 0.2% fee.\n\n**Coinvestment Justification**\n\nICHI liquidity on Bancor is now at parity with ICHI liquidity on Sushiswap because of the last coinvestment increase but there is only space available for 3,898 more ICHI. [ICHI currently provides a 46% APY to this pool via xICHI rewards](https://app.ichi.org/farm). An increase in co-investment to 700k BNT will enable Bancor liquidity to surpass ICHI liquidity on other AMMs.\n\n**ICHI News Highlights Since Last Proposal**\n\n* [ICHI launches ‘Decentralized Monetary Authority’ for stablecoin issuance (CoinTelegraph)](https://cointelegraph.com/news/ichi-launches-decentralized-monetary-authority-for-stablecoin-issuance)\n* [Filecoin Now Has Its Own Stablecoin.

      "content": "**This proposal is expected to appear on Snapshot for voting on August 15, 2021 8:00 AM EST. Make sure to stake your vBNT for voting before this date and time to participate in the DAO decision.**\n\n# TLDR;\n\n* This Proposal seeks to increase the Co-Investment Limit on the UMA Pool to 500K BNT.\n* It will open up space on the TKN side (UMA) and lead to an increase in the depth of the pool as LPs add liquidity.\n* A larger UMA pool will attract more trades from aggregators and professional market makers to Bancor which will provide more fees to the platform.\n* **UMA Has agreed to match part of this co-investment with 500,000 USD worth of UMA.**\n\n## Abstract\n\nThere is currently 35K~ USD In the UMA Liquidity Pool on Bancor. This proposal seeks to increase the co-investment on said pool to 500K BNT, offering enough room for roughly 2M USD worth of space at a 4$ BNT. The UMA Team has graciously agreed to help seed the pool with an initial 500,000$ worth of UMA which comes out to around 50K UMA. With this initial liquidity the pool should have deep enough liquidity to start pulling in trades and generate a good APR. UMA is an incredibly desirable pool.\n\n## Motivation\n\nThe UMA Pool remains one of the few pools that Bancor has yet to capture the market for. Looking at competing AMMs we can see that the UMA Pair has a large number of LPers with a combined value between the pools of 5.5 Million USD denominated in UMA.\n\n![|624x233](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/bancordao/optimized/2X/c/c7a4db01fb4b2676696515ba49fc3ee62488e7ca_2_1248x466.jpeg)![|624x233](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/bancordao/optimized/2X/c/c3d1fb6ca660e1bae805100eb4269386bbd90dfb_2_1248x466.png)![|624x259](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/bancordao/optimized/2X/3/36cd563a110233facdb1f9c19b64209dc6bdae8c_2_1248x518.jpeg)\n\nFurthermore, The pair has a very healthy Liquidity to Volume Ratio which makes it a great pair for generating revenue for the platform. A 500K BNT Co-Investment, along with the help of the UMA Treasury, will help us initially match Uniswap’s Liquidity but the ultimate goal remains to dethrone Sushi. After we see this space fill, I see no reason as to why the DAO wouldn’t pass another proposal to beat out the Sushi Pool, but that can be left for another vote.\n\n## Benefits to UMAns\n\nAfter doing a little bit of digging on the pair it is clear that Bancor should be the best place for UMAns to place their tokens. UMAns will receive the great advantage of Impermanent Loss Protection as well as single sided staking. I believe this will resonate strongly with the community since everyone over there is extremely committed to their token. Single Sided Staking will allow the current Sushi UMA LPs to keep or sell their Ethereum for more UMA to have more exposure to their favorite token. And as far as Impermanent Loss, it is better to simply show you exactly what Bancor is protecting you from :\n\n![|624x384](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/bancordao/optimized/2X/1/17ecb6c881df93ffb501e2829c7bc2214e6c3335_2_1248x768.jpeg)![|624x384](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/bancordao/optimized/2X/a/a2661d13361c3e6043bb3c70dafd866791b58ed8_2_1248x768.png)\n![Screen Shot 2021-08-02 at 7.26.23 PM|690x307, 100%](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/bancordao/optimized/2X/e/e0be4dee9e9ebc9b652f2dad249f1a551900dcba_2_1380x614.png)\n\n\n## Voting Instructions\n\n**FOR**\n* Open Up Space for 500,000 BNT Worth of UMA.\n* UMA Treasury Matched 500,000$ Co-Investment.\n* Gain market share of UMA's great Liquidity and Volume.\n* Further Involve ourselves with UMA Community.\n\n**AGAINST**\n\n* No - I hate Money.",

Make sure to stake your vBNT for voting before this date and time to participate in the DAO decision.\n\n# Proposal to Activate LM rewards for LQTY\n\n### TL;DR\n\n* Proposal to activate liquidity mining rewards for LQTY.\n*  **EDIT:** Based on feedback, the proposed allocation/duration is **500 BNT/week for 12 weeks.** \n* The LQTY/BNT Pool was recently whitelisted on 6/25/2021. The previous proposal and additional information can be found [here](https://gov.bancor.network/t/bancordao-whitelist-proposal-whitelist-lqty/2440).\n* The benefits to Bancor are clear.\n\nLQTY token address: 0x6dea81c8171d0ba574754ef6f8b412f2ed88c54d\n\nProject Website: [https://www.liquity.org/ ](https://www.liquity.org/)\n\n### Project\n\nLiquity is a decentralized borrowing protocol that allows users to draw interest-free loans against ETH as collateral (akin to MakerDAO). Loans are paid out in LUSD (USD-pegged stablecoin) and need to maintain a minimum collateral ratio of 110%. Loans are secured by the [Stability Pool](https://docs.liquity.org/faq/stability-pool-and-liquidations), where users can deposit LUSD and provide up-front capital to offset uncollateralized debt. In return, they receive ETH collateral when liquidations occur and continuous LQTY rewards (our secondary token).\n\nIn addition to Liquity’s focus on capital-efficiency, the protocol is fully decentralized. Liquity contracts have no admin keys and are accessible via multiple interfaces hosted by different Frontend Operators, making it censorship resistant. The protocol is also governance-free, as all operations are algorithmic and fully automated, and protocol parameters to maintain system health were set at time of contract deployment.\n\n### Tokenomics\n\nLiquity’s native token, LQTY (ERC20), is used as a reward mechanism within the Liquity ecosystem as stated previously. Furthermore, LQTY can be staked to capture 100% of protocol fees (paid in LUSD & ETH) with no additional risks added (such as token slashing) to backstop the system. Since launch on April 5th, stakers have been paid ~$13.7M in protocol revenue.\n\n### Benefits to Bancor\n\n**Liquidity**\n\nThe LQTY/BNT Pool was recently whitelisted on 6/25/2021 (the previous proposal and additional information can be found [here](https://gov.bancor.network/t/bancordao-whitelist-proposal-whitelist-lqty/2440)) and has already attracted ~$350k in liquidity — slowly catching up to the [LQTY/ETH](https://info.uniswap.org/#/pools/0xd1d5a4c0ea98971894772dcd6d2f1dc71083c44e) pool on Uniswap V3.\n\nWith borrowing activity and protocol revenue (i.e. APR) being inconsistent due to market conditions (ranging from about 4%-36% at time of writing), LQTY stakers may want to diversify how they use their LQTY tokens — the Bancor pool with LM rewards could be the perfect place. This would be the first and only incentivized LQTY pool, making Bancor the clear choice of migration for some of the ~6M LQTY staked and the 74k LQTY currently sitting in the Uniswap pool. Users in our community have been looking for more things to do with their LQTY and providing liquidity to Bancor with single sided protection and LM rewards could scratch that itch while providing value for the Bancor ecosystem.\n\n**Volume**\n\nDue to LQTY’s fragmented liquidity, volume is heavily skewed towards the DEX with the most liquidity. On August 1st (and surrounding days), trading volume of LQTY increased significantly across Uniswap and Bancor. Here’s how the overall volume was split:\n\n![|624x229](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/bancordao/optimized/2X/1/11cafa23ae16038015b658ab85f158c1af7e0417_2_1248x458.png)\n\n![|624x299](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/bancordao/optimized/2X/d/d42bfeecacec31b1df3a437e56bfac8181ed54f1_2_1248x598.png)\n\n*Note: Daily volume of the LQTY/BNT pool can be found [here](https://duneanalytics.com/queries/83208).*\n\nUniswap attracted over $2M in trading volume while Bancor attracted $277K because Uniswap had more liquidity available. This dynamic could be flipped if Bancor were to capture a majority of the liquidity instead.\n\nIt’s also the case that users cannot make decently sized trades for LQTY since liquidity is split between Uniswap and Bancor, and driving most of the liquidity to one DEX would significantly mitigate this issue — leading to more volume as a result.\n\nLQTY is relatively young and is clearly still developing its liquidity. We believe now is the optimal time to capture it, which only benefits Bancor as LQTY continues to mature.\n\n### Duration and BNT Allocation\n\nTo provide flexibility, the Bancor DAO should decide the duration and BNT allocation if possible (Re: [this post](https://gov.bancor.network/t/draft-proposal-use-ranked-choice-voting-for-duration-and-bnt-reward-rates-of-liquidity-mining-campaigns/2515/12#this-in-my-opinion-should-be-the-general-framework-for-lm-1)). This allows an option for the DAO to not overcommit with rewards, while still being able to bootstrap the pool to their liking and leaving the door open to make a near future decision based on how successful this campaign is if passed. Preferably, the duration should be on the longer side and rewards should be competitive enough to compete with Uniswap and the LQTY staking pool to ensure:\n\n1. Bancor becomes the long-term home for LQTY\n2. Liquidity doesn’t dry up in the short-term\n3. Existing Uniswap LPs and some of the LQTY stakers migrate to Bancor\n\n**EDIT:** Based on the discussion below and data from @tenzent, the proposed duration and allocation is **500 BNT/week for 12 weeks.**",

Make sure to stake your vBNT for voting before this date and time to participate in the DAO decision.\n\n**TLDR**\n\n* This proposal seeks to increase the Co-investment limit to 500K BNT in the QNT pool.\n* It will open up space for LPs on the TKN side (QNT) and potentially increase the depth of the pool as LPs add liquidity\n* A larger QNT pool will attract more trades from aggregators and professional market makers to Bancor which ultimately leads to more fees for our platform.\n\n**For**\n\n1. A larger co-investment limit on the pool will let LPs provided single sided liquidity and will lead to an increase in pool depth\n2. More liquidity in the QNT-BNT pool should lead to larger volume from DEX aggregators and professional market makers sent in our direction\n3. More volume for Bancor leads to more fees for our platform and BNT holders\n\n**Against**\n\n1. We should not increase the limit on the pool.\n\n**Abstract**\nThere is currently 53.7K BNT and 2.1K QNT tokens in the BNT-QNT [pool](https://etherscan.io/address/0x11A9FE753fEe7f8Fd02eFef1a32e81217098D3D0). This has resulted in a pool that has roughly 315K in liquidity. At the moment, LPs on the TKN side (QNT) can’t provide single sided liquidity since there is no capacity. This proposal is seeking to increase single-sided capacity in the QNT pool by increasing the Co-investment limit to 500K BNT.\n\n![image|477x305](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/bancordao/original/2X/c/c036ad9161cc5e7ba798f8c723be262d83c7411e.png)\n\n\n**Motivation**\n\nIf we want to attract more QNT LPs to Bancor, we need to open up space in the pool so that they can provide single sided liquidity. This would allow us to grow the liquidity in the pool and attract larger trades towards our platform which ultimately results in higher fees for Bancor. The QNT pool went live with the release of 2.1 and has recently become popular due to the [coinbase listing](https://blog.coinbase.com/barnbridge-bond-livepeer-lpt-and-quant-qnt-are-launching-on-coinbase-pro-50582f1b6ed0).\n\nThe data for the QNT-BNT pool shows that its protected value has been at around 400K since early March:\n\n![image|689x269](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/bancordao/original/2X/d/d51bf72cd57660918ac02a0136b8a363e6e169b1.png)\n\nThis suggest to me that there is demand for LPs on the QNT side to provide liquidity and we should open up space (it has been filled for a while).\n\nThe top pools for QNT are on Uniswap v2 and v3 and are paired with ETH. Cumulative liquidity is roughly ~3M on other DEXes and we should be able to make the Bancor pool deeper to support larger trades with low price impact.\n\n![image|457x500](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/bancordao/original/2X/3/375e8478c99c42be9ce194db0b06ff91792820e7.png)\n![image|461x500](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/bancordao/original/2X/7/78b9eb09d10f4ecb9a276801751713768186dfb9.jpeg)\n\nCurrently, this pool is filled completely on Bancor and LPs can’t provide single sided liquidity on the TKN side (QNT). I am proposing a 500K Co-investment limit for the QNT pool which should open up roughly 1.5M in single sided liquidity (assuming BNT price at $3.00). If this pools fills up completely, we would have a pool that’s roughly ~3M in depth.",

      "content": "Extension of LM rewards plan\n\nStake vBNT for voting on this proposal before Wednesday 15st August, 2021 (UTC)\n\nTL;DR\n\n1. The LM Rewards program will be extended on ETH, LINK, WBTC.\n2. The current award rates for each pool will be unaffected.\n3. The rewards will be extended for another 90 days, however will be stopped in the day of release of V3 if V3 is deployed in 90 days.\n\n# Extension of Liquidity Mining on Current Pools\n\nThe LM rewards schedule for ETH, INK, WBTC, due to end in less than 2 weeks. To maintain liquidity in the near term, and to sustain liquidity while Bancor prepares new products and upgrades, wherein it is proposed to extend the LM rewards program on these pools for a further 12 weeks with conditions to stop if the V3 is released\n\n1. ETH, LINK, and WBTC will continue to receive emissions of 100-200K BNT per week, for an additional 12 weeks.\n2. Upon release of the V3, a new LM incentives program may be considered by the DAO. Therefore the current liquidity mining plan will be stopped to incentivise migration.\n\n# Discussion\n\n1. Around 75% of tokens have been restaked back into the pools; therefore, the LM rewards have increased the space for single-sided TKN deposits, resulting in growth of the network, rather than creating a sell pressure.\n\n2. The above 3 pools hold the majority of the protocol TVL, therefore curation of these pools is essential to maintain the position of the Bancor protocol on the market.\n\n3. The 3 mentioned above pools drive most of the volume on the ecosystem, and also present reasonable impermanent loss liability.\n\n4. The pools should be curated until the new V3 design is released so the funds are migrated without loss of significant TVL prior the protocol upgrade\n\n# Summary\n\n1. At this stage, current protocol growth requires LM to maintain the momentum and stay competitive in the space (the DAO seems aware of this).\n2. After releasing the V3 and supporting the smooth liquidity migration, LM extension will no longer be necessary, and the voting for LM extensions may be concluded.\n3. A large majority of the LM rewards are re-staked to the protocol, increasing the TVL and the space available for TKN deposits with single sided exposure. If this trend continues, the LM program is more of an asset than a liability, and can be managed more assertively.\n4. In the long term, Bancor is aiming towards sustainable annual inflation of 4%, in order to achieve that, Bancor requires significant volume and Vortex to be applied.\n5. **Extension of LM rewards on ETH, WBTC and LINK for 12 weeks will provide 1,200,000 - 2,400,000 BNTs as rewards, (depends on the multiplier).",

DIGITALAX is the first web3 fashion protocol, founded last year September 2020.\n\nIs swapping rich digital assets and collections through fashion and skins the key to unfreezing the metaverse as a coherent asset class?\n\nDIGITALAX is here to prove that web3 fashion is the missing bridge that will onboard millions of capital savvy new users into DeFi. We’ve built an entire ecosystem across digital and physical fashion, NFTs, gaming, esports and the metaverse. We are firm believers in the necessity of progressive decentralisation in order to serve the core principles of web3 and are overtime decentralising to have our token holders take over governance through a DAO.\n\n# **Major Milestones**\n* ESPA esports integrations\n  * Among Us modded content\n    * Over $160K sales in $MONA on NFT skins\n  * Minecraft Bed Wars tournaments\n    * One of the top international servers with thousands of players across Europe, India and the US\n  * Roblox Obby tournaments (Launching Soon)\n    * Partnered game for integration has a 24 million unique player reach.\n  * CS:GO mod tournaments (Launching Soon)\n  * Budding developer ecosystem with custom games and mods being built specifically to be launched through ESPA.\n    * 2D battle royales\n    * MMORPG\n    * 2D/3D platformers\n  * Over 1800 active players in the ESPA discord server.\n\n* NFT Fashion Marketplace\n  * Launched November 2020 (Before NFT hype cycle)\n    * Total of 7 sale events (auction + instant buy) with over $600K in sales total.\n    * Over 40 digital fashion designers highlighted for the sales events.\n    * DIGITALAX Treasury took 0% profit from 2/7 of the auctions and a scale of between 15-20% for the other 5.\n\n* Pioneering Engineering\n  * One of the first projects to integrate with Polygon back in early February 2020\n  * Developed and implemented the first Multi-Token bridge between Ethereum and Polygon\n    * Supports the ERC-998 standard and DIGITALAX variant ERC-998 standard (ERC-721 master tokens and ERC-1155 Child tokens)\n    * Entirely open sourced.\n\n# **Security**\nAll DIGITALAX and $MONA contracts have limited admin permissions, such as; Administrators are not able to move tokens on behalf of token holders. What they can do is update the token URIs for digitalax token metadata to ensure the quality of the NFT data and safeguard against mistakes— all metadata is stored in a dedicated IPFS gateway. Admins can also mint NFTs, but once a token holder receives that token only them or approved parties to their wallet are able to move it. The contracts and addresses with the highest concentration of $MONA tokens are predominantly the token staking contracts and DIGITALAX multi-sig treasury address. The DIGITALAX dev team performs persistent code peer reviews and unit tests across all deployed code, conforming to contribution guidelines. Each solidity contract is cross reviewed with other Solidity devs on the team to make sure there are no vulnerabilities and funds are safe. We pertain to the latest code and syntax standards and ensure our tests have decent test coverage. We check all the important methods in our code with unit tests to make sure there is no risk that value will be lost at any time. Both $MONA and DIGITALAX tokens are under the leadership of the admin team which also coordinates token rewards and token splits between the different NFT and LP staking pools we operate. DIGITALAX uses a system of primary sale prices to decide the awards that any given user receives in a staking pool.\n\nRoles are also split up across our ecosystem for additional protection against exploits and vulnerabilities, including admin roles, minter roles, verified minters that can create open source fractional 1155, and smart contract roles for special contract actions. \n\n# **Tokenomics**\n$MONA is the core ERC-20 utility for the DIGITALAX ecosystem.\n\nRecently, the $MONA token supply was increased by 1,300 tokens (Set for early August). This was a small scoped and targeted increase specifically for addressing the market opportunity of onboarding new retail and consumers and arbitraging persistent hungry buyers into the market through hybrid digital and physical fashion, incentivised with DeFi.\n\nThis adjustment in the $MONA token supply is followed by a contract freeze on any further minting.\n\n1. 1300 additional $MONA mint;\n   * 700 distributed under a vested composite NFT sale.\n   * 500 allocated to NFT staking rewards.\n   * 100 allocated for the DIGITALAX treasury.\n\nThe Vested Composite NFT product is being made available for sale from the end of July/ early August. It allows the holder to stake it in our new to-be-deployed Polygon staking contracts for a composite yield on profits from the DRIP fashion NFT sales combined with vested $MONA distribution ($MONA = DIGITALAX native ERC-20). This new product specifically gives exposure to this arbitrage between fashion, gaming and decentralised technologies.\n\n* A mix of ERC-20s are accepted on DRIP for purchases of the fashion items. 15% of the profits delivered in this dynamic ERC-20 mix will be distributed as a monthly yield to holders of the composite NFT that they have staked in the new contracts. Eligibility for this profit split allocation is supported for 6 months.\n* This NFT staking will also include vested $MONA rewards over a 3 month period.\n* 1 $MONA is included in the composite index and vested over a period of 3 months where the $MONA is staked for earning further $MONA yield from the NFT staking contracts.\n\n**$MONA Token Distribution**\n![Screen Shot 2021-07-21 at 8.47.18 PM|690x417](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/bancordao/original/2X/3/3cef728ee211dcc037073b1a6fce2f30e23607e5.jpeg)\n\n**Current Holder Distribution**\n![Screen Shot 2021-07-21 at 8.47.42 PM|690x311](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/bancordao/original/2X/6/6be1000ad6124a042338b1da04756e21f7aa4edf.jpeg)\n\n# **Community and Ecosystem**\nDIGITALAX’s community consists of designers, developers, modders, gamers, creators and crypto/DeFi enthusiasts.

      "content": "DRC (Digital Reserve Currency) has been whitelisted by the Bancor DAO on July 29, 2021. The initial co-investment limit was 30,000 BNT. The DRC/BNT pool became popular among LPs, and currently, it has almost no available DRC space. As of July 31, 2021, the available space was 8,215 DRC, which was equal to $20.5.\n\n![image|222x248](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/bancordao/original/2X/6/67344ffd7f0b4b40c75d0bf36c1d9b3ebb7c602e.png)\n\n**TLDR**\n•\tThis proposal seeks to increase the co-investment limit to 50,000 BNT in the DRC pool.\n•\tIt will open more space for LPs and will lead to an increase in the depth of the pool and the trading volume once LPs add liquidity.\n•\tA larger DRC pool will attract more trades from aggregators and professional market makers to Bancor, which will ultimately lead to more trading fees.\n\n\n**Abstract**\nThere are currently ~30K BNT and ~40M DRC tokens in the DRC/BNT liquidity pool. The pool has roughly $240K in liquidity. At the moment, LPs cannot provide any substantial DRC single-sided liquidity, since there is no capacity. This proposal is seeking to increase single-sided capacity in the DRC/BNT pool by increasing the co-investment limit to 50,000 BNT.\n\n**Motivation**\nIf we want to attract more DRC LPs to Bancor, we need to open up space in the pool so that they can provide more single sided liquidity. This would allow us to grow the liquidity in the pool and increase the trading volume, which will ultimately result in higher trading fees.\n\nSince its inception, the DRC/BNT pool data shows that it has been in high demand and has been filled up completely within 48 hours since it’s launch on the Bancor platform.\n\nThe possibility of one-way staking with the impairment loss protection encourages DRC liquidity providers to increase the pool size. The increase of the DRC pool size will ultimately lead to the increase of the trading volume on the Bancor platform. \n\nThe DRC Foundation will be actively supporting the Bancor market, explaining DRC holders the unique advantages offered by Bancor, such as low trading fees and the availability of limit orders.\n\nWe expect the trading volume for DRC to increase significantly on the Bancor platform because of its competitive advantage comparing to other decentralized exchanges, where DRC is currently traded.\n\nOverall, we believe that the increase of the BNT co-investment will benefit both DRC and Bancor ecosystems and their communities.",

      "title": "Proposal: Activate LM rewards for AMP pool for 8 Weeks + 2M BNT Co-invest",
      "content": "In collaboration with @kk182 from the AMP community and @issabobissa (who brought up the [original LM campaign](https://gov.bancor.network/t/proposal-to-activate-liquidity-mining-for-amp-and-increase-co-investment-limits-to-150k-bnt/1454) proposal a few months ago)\n\nProposal to add mid cap LM rewards to the AMP-BNT pool with an eight week duration and increase the co-investment limit to 2M BNT. Reward rates should be at similar levels to the current LM campaigns on the AAVE, SNX, BAT, WOO, etc… pools which is roughly 10K-20K BNT per week.\n\n**Vote For**:\nEnable LM rewards for an eight week duration on the AMP-BNT Pool (Conditional upon onboarding BNT to the Flexa Network, currently ongoing behind the scenes)\nIncrease the co-investment limit to 2M BNT from 1M BNT\n\n**Vote Against**:\nDo not enable LM rewards for the AMP-BNT Pool\n\n**TLDR**:\n* This proposal seeks to activate LM rewards on the AMP-BNT pool and increase the co-investment limit to 2M BNT\n* The Amp community has already been highly supportive of Bancor’s platform and the Bancor community so this would be another step in strengthening the relationship between the two communities.\n* The Amp community will be hosting an AMA in their [Discord](https://amptoken.org/discord/) featuring our very own Nate Hindman and Mark Richardson to drive awareness about the Bancor platform to their large userbase.\n* Bancor is applying to have BNT onboarded as a supported digital token on the [Flexa Network](https://flexa.network/currencies)\n* Bancor already has the deepest liquidity for the $AMP token across competing platforms, thus making it the ideal platform for more large trades from aggregators and professional market makers\n* Amp LPs are staking-natives, not farm-and-dumpers. BNT rewards are likely to be returned en-masse back into the pools.\n* Incentivizing this pool will continue to bring in even more traders and LPs to the pool that will lead to a long lasting relationship between the two communities\n\nToken Contract Address:\n\n[0xff20817765cb7f73d4bde2e66e067e58d11095c2](https://etherscan.io/token/0xff20817765cb7f73d4bde2e66e067e58d11095c2)\n\nProject Website:\n\nhttps://amptoken.org/\n\n**Overview**:\n\nAmp is a digital collateral token that offers instant, verifiable collateralization for any kind of value transfer. Projects like [Flexa](https://flexa.network/) use Amp to secure transactions and build networks that accrue value both securely and transparently. Flexa, a payments network, is the first use case of Amp's features as a collateral token. The Flexa Capacity contract is a collateral manager that uses Amp to collateralize the payments of 40,000+ merchant locations across the US and Canada.\n\n**Motivation**:\n\nThe Amp community has been very excited about the Bancor platform ever since being whitelisted. In fact, a [proposal was passed to increase the BNT co-investment](https://vote.bancor.network/#/bancornetwork.eth/proposal/Qmcs7TF7ybLprwFZxds33oWdMRSPFscSkVXVwcRGE1UH9u) due to the high demand for the Amp side of the pool and no space left. That proposal was passed back in April 2021 and the Amp community has since increased by 173% and 288% on Twitter and Reddit, respectively. At over 20,000 members on Twitter and Reddit each, a LM reward campaign would present an opportunity for newer members to learn about Bancor, use the platform, and join the community as well.\n\n**Amp’s community presence**\n\nAmp has a sizable presence especially across Twitter and Reddit:\n\n[Twitter](https://twitter.com/amptoken): 21,932 members\n[TG](http://t.me/ampchat): 2,485 members\n[Discord](https://discord.gg/T4EY6yx): 10,636 members\n[Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/AMPToken/): 24,807 members\n\nIn addition to the above, 4 more Amp Telegram community channels in other languages have popped up organically in the last few weeks: [Chinese](http://t.me/ampchinese), [French](http://t.me/ampfrench), [Indonesia](http://t.me/AmpIndonesiaCommunity), [Spanish](http://t.me/ampspanish).\n\n![|624x349](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/bancordao/optimized/2X/a/a208a31c8a1f51169340c8001d4a6add20f653bf_2_1248x698.png)\n\n**Market indicators of Bancor opportunity**\n\nThe market cap for AMP is roughly $3.3B with $67M in trading volume the last 24 hours as of time of writing.\n\n![|227x290](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/bancordao/original/2X/3/368b9b697986aff614b25a137fbe3a2143e9e47d.png)\n\nSince the beginning of the year, it has done roughly $12.8M daily volume on average (see: [historical stats](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/amp/historical_data/usd?end_date=2021-07-28&start_date=2021-01-01#panel)) on Exchanges.

There is large appetite from the AMP community to stake AMP in the Bancor pool and migrate this liquidity over. With LM rewards as an incentive, we could capture liquidity from Balancer as well as Uniswap and Sushiswap\n\n![|289x379](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/bancordao/original/2X/5/5d39d923ab63a19d4403824fc2d4f9a11ee9840a.png) Source: Uniswapv2\n\n![|624x247](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/bancordao/original/2X/4/43c01ac65602144f6343204afdfbee90d27e0656.png)\n\nSource: Analytics.sushi.com\n\nOn the Bancor platform, AMP has undoubtedly ranked as one of our top performer pools for the past weeks if not months. \n\n**Use Cases**\n\nThe current primary use case of the Amp token is to be staked in the [Flexa Capacity contract](https://app.flexa.network/) to collateralize payments on the Flexa network. Currently, the Capacity contract has 23B AMP ($1.6B) staked in it as most of the Amp community are staking natives.\n\n![|624x277](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/bancordao/original/2X/2/275275b1bd042c4706b70c0392cc58f8f2510d9f.jpeg)\n\nSource: app.flexa.network\n\nThe APY on Capacity is 3% but with LM rewards, Bancor also has an opportunity to attract some of these long term stakers looking to earn more with their Amp and invest in another community.\n\nOther:\n\n* Earn interest with Gemini (http://gemini.com/earn)\n* Earn SUSHI rewards on the AMP-ETH pool on Onsen (https://app.sushi.com/farm )\n\n**Long term strategic opportunity**\n\nBuilding ties with the AMP community could be beneficial to Bancor in the future as it could pave the way for a Bancor Pay solution integrated into the Bancor platform. This could potentially allow Bancor users to deposit supported digital tokens (AMP, BAT, COMP, LINK, ZRX, LRC plus BNT in the future if it gets onboarded) and stablecoins (USDC, GUSD, DAI) into their Bancor wallet which can be used for payments with retailers that are integrated into the Flexa network. This could be a good differentiator that sets the Bancor platform apart from other competing DEXes and would enable new functionality for the benefit of Bancor users.\n\n**Why LM for AMP now?**\n\nHaving built out extensive foundations and partnerships to serve market needs, now AMP is focused on providing new opportunities for holders and the ecosystem overall (as outlined in the Long term strategic opportunity above) and cross protocol usage of AMP to support scaling of the economy.\n\n**What does Bancor get?**\n\n* The AMP pool draws liquidity from an expanded market beyond DeFi, crypto, NFTs-- it’s the entire retail market. Flexa, and Amp consequently, gets a lot of exposure to the retail market so any collaborations with Amp will lead to more Bancor exposure to a new audience.\n* Integration with the AMP (Retail) x Bancor (DeFi) bridge enhances interoperability for BNT/AMP liquidity pool across other DeFi protocols and the overall market.\n* A transparent mechanism to convert retail consumer sentiment into loyalty towards Bancor as a DeFi protocol\n* Hype for a future opportunity to integrate a BNT x AMP payment solution\n\n**Available Audits**:\n\n[Consensys Diligence Audit Report Amp](https://consensys.net/diligence/audits/2020/06/amp/) (June 2020)\n\n[Trail of Bits: Amp Security Assessment](https://github.com/trailofbits/publications/blob/master/reviews/amp.pdf) (August 2020)\n\n**Whitepaper**:\n\nhttps://amptoken.org/whitepaper.pdf\n\n**Amp More Information**:\n[July 28: ~1m TLDR on AMP](https://blog.binance.us/all-about-amp/)\n[June 17: Digital Payments 101 (a story featuring the AMP TOKEN)](https://twitter.com/floatingratio/status/1405641894512803842)\n\n**Amp Recent Developments**:\n[August 6: AMP is coming to the cross-chain lending protocol zero1_flux](https://twitter.com/amptoken/status/1422252185434431490)\n[July 28: AMP listed on Binance](https://twitter.com/BinanceUS/status/1420353348398510080)\n[July 7: Flexa (leverages AMP) announces collab. w/ @InCommPayments, a global payments tech company with >500,000 retailers globally.](https://twitter.com/FlexaHQ/status/1412777679686864898)\n[July 2: AMP listed on Bittrex](https://twitter.com/BittrexGlobal/status/1411009353918844931)\n[June 29: AMP x RULER first collateral collab begins](https://twitter.com/RulerProtocol/status/1410020119804272645)\n[June 16: AMP listed on BitMart](https://twitter.com/BitMartExchange/status/1405274657075302404)\n[June 10: AMP listed on CoinBase](https://twitter.com/coinbase/status/1403080939111124993)",

It's developed by Enjin, an established project whose Co-founder & CTO, Witek Radomski, authored the ERC-1155 token standard.\n* The benefit to Bancor is clear. An EFI pool will bring volume and awareness to Bancor, as evidenced by the popular ENJ pool.\n* Enjin has been a long-term strategic partner of Bancor, and remains a contributor to the ecosystem over the entirety of Bancor’s product development history.\n\n### Token Address: [0x656C00e1BcD96f256F224AD9112FF426Ef053733](https://etherscan.io/token/0x656c00e1bcd96f256f224ad9112ff426ef053733)\n### Project Websites: \n* Enjin: [enjin.io](https://enjin.io)\n* Efinity whitepaper: [efinity.io](https://efinity.io)\n\n# Token Security \nThe EFI token supply is fixed at 2,000,000,000.\n\nThe token was independently audited; results from the audit report are forthcoming and will be shared before whitelisting.\n\n# About Enjin\nEnjin is the team behind Enjin Coin (ENJ). The team is expanding their existing blockchain product ecosystem with Efinity, a cross-chain NFT network powered by the Efinity Token (EFI) and built on Polkadot.\n\nEnjin was founded in 2009 by Maxim Blagov and Witek Radomski. Over the next decade, they organically grew their first product, the [Enjin Network](https://enjin.com/), to over 20 million gamers worldwide.\n\nIn 2017, the company hosted a successful ICO of ENJ, and began pioneering a vision for non-fungible tokens (NFTs). The team authored the advanced [ERC-1155 token standard](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/1155), and launched the first NFT creation platform, which features a unique token infusion mechanism that now powers billions of digital assets.\n\nEnjin's ecosystem features a full suite of products for utilizing NFTs:\n\n* Enjin Platform: NFT minting platform that features a powerful API, Wallet Daemon, SDKs (Unity, Godot, Java, with C# and C++ in development), and plugins (EjinCraft plugin for Minecraft)\n* EnjinX: blockchain explorer\n* Enjin Marketplace: NFT marketplace\n* Enjin Wallet: crypto and NFT wallet\n* Enjin Beam: QR code-based service for distributing NFTs\n* JumpNet: Fee-free, carbon-negative blockchain\n* NFT.io: next-generation marketplace for NFTs (in development)\n* Efinity: NFT blockchain built on Polkadot (in development)\n\nLeading global brands such as [Microsoft](https://enjin.io/blog/microsoft-azure-heroes) and [Binance](https://enjin.io/powered-by-enjin/binance-collectibles) are using Enjin’s NFT ecosystem to engage and grow their audiences. Over 50 game and app developers are using Enjin to create and integrate NFTs, from open-world RPGs to augmented reality and sci-fi fantasy adventures. \n\n## ENJ Liquidity Pool\n\nThe ENJ pool is a Bancor veteran. ENJ liquidity providers have been loyal members of the Bancor community long enough to witness both the [v2.0](https://enjin.io/blog/bancor-v2) and v2.1 protocol upgrades. The pool is among the most performant on the Bancor ecosystem, and has consistently maintained its status as the deepest pools on the Bancor Network.\n\nAt the time of writing, the ENJ pool has over $25.7M in liquidity, with 24H volume of $298k.\n\nENJ LPs have demonstrated a long-term commitment to the Bancor protocol, and this same community would make the EFI pool a success in the Bancor ecosystem.\n\n![Screen Shot 2021-08-04 at 9.23.34 AM|690x65](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/bancordao/original/2X/0/078548ee839091043609535e2bc02ca42912bc12.png)\n\n# The Efinity Project\nEfinity is a next-generation blockchain for non-fungible tokens (NFTs) developed by[ Enjin](https://enjin.io/). Enjin pioneered the NFT industry in 2017, authoring the advanced ERC-1155 NFT standard and launching the first NFT creation platform.\n\nBuilt on Polkadot in partnership with Parity Technologies, Efinity is purpose-built for NFTs. As a cross-chain network, it will support tokens from *any* blockchain.\n\nEfinity is environmentally friendly, scalable, and designed to enable a future where NFTs are as widespread and easy-to-use as smartphones today. It’s built for games, apps, enterprises, and individual creators to deliver their own NFTs to mainstream audiences.\n\n**EFI is the native token of Efinity, designed for transaction fees, liquidity, community rewards, and governance.**\n\n## Development Progress\n\nIn Enjin's latest [development update](https://enjin.io/blog/dev-update-july-2021), the team noted the following progress related to [Phase 1](https://efinity.io/whitepaper/roadmap) of the Efinity roadmap:\n\n\"Internally, we have an early alpha of Efinity running, with the base features for creating and interacting with tokens:\n\n* The **multi-asset pallet** for creating, minting, transferring, and burning tokens is 75% complete.\n* The [ **Paratoken standard** ](https://efinity.io/whitepaper/efinity-parachain), which will be interoperable with the entire Polkadot and Kusama ecosystem, is 50% complete\n* **Optimized batch and storage operations** will allow up to **40 million NFTs** to be minted or transferred in 1 transaction/block. The fee for minting or transferring millions of tokens is multiple orders of magnitude less than any Ethereum transaction, including ERC-1155 mints/transfers. *Note: these numbers may vary slightly when Efinity is released.*\n* A **REST API** for interacting with Efinity, which can also be done with the official Polkadot.JS wallet.\"\n\nEfinity will include various [ **unique features**](https://efinity.io/whitepaper/features), such as community governance (via voting), self-governed development (via EFI treasury), perpetual liquidity for crypto and NFTs (via Efinity Swap and marketplace price discovery), cross-chain interoperability (via Snowfork bridges), and easy on-boarding of new users (via Discrete Accounts and Fuel Tanks).\n\n# Tokenomics\nEnjin is developing a new token standard called Paratokens, which will be compatible with the entire Polkadot and Kusama ecosystem.\n\nAs the first paratoken on the Efinity network, [EFI](https://efinity.io/whitepaper/efinity-parachain) is designed for transaction fees, liquidity, rewards, and community governance.\n\nEFI also serves a purpose on Enjin’s JumpNet blockchain: by holding EFI on JumpNet (“JEFI”), users will be able to [increase their transaction limits](https://enjin.io/help/efi-to-jnet-guide) and continue enjoying instant, free NFT, and ERC-20 token transfers on-chain.\n\nThe total supply of EFI is 2,000,000,000 tokens, distributed as follows:\n\n* Public Sale: 5%\n* Seed Round: 3%\n* Strategic Round: 5%\n* Early Round: 7%\n* Staking & Pools: 15%\n* Ecosystem: 35%\n* Team: 10%\n* Company: 20% \n\n# Community and Communication\nEnjin is active on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/enjin), [Telegram](https://t.me/enjin), [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/EnjinCoin/), [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/enjinsocial), [Discord](https://enj.in/discord), [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/enjin/), [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/enjintv), WeChat, [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/enjin).\n\nWitek Radomski, the co-founder and CTO of Enjin, is the project’s main spokesperson, along with Caleb Applegate, COO.\n\nThe Enjin website includes a mailing address in Singapore, as well as the following contact e-mails:\n\n* Mailing: Enjin Pte Lte, 16 Raffles Quay #33-03, Hong Leong Building, Singapore, 048581\n* User support: support@enjin.io\n* General and business inquiries: [contact@enjin.io](mailto:contact@enjin.io?subject=Hello!) \n\n# Audits\nThe EFI token and vesting have been audited by Securing. Results from the report are forthcoming.\n\nWithin the Enjin ecosystem, independent audits have also been performed for the Enjin Wallet ([ORU Security, 2018](https://enj.in/wallet-audit)), JumpNet (Securing, June 2021), Enjin Coin ([Callisto](https://callisto.network/enjin-token-enj-security-audit/), 2019) and Enjin Coin Token Sale ([Matthew Di Ferrante](https://s3.amazonaws.com/files.enjin.com/81/enjin-coin-audit.pdf), 2017).\n\nEnjin also maintains an [open bug bounty program](https://enj.in/security).\n\n# Market and Trading Data\n* Max Total Supply: 2,000,000,000\n* Private Sale Price: $0.03-$0.075\n* Public Sale Price: $0.20\n* Token listings: EFI will be listed on exchanges beginning on August 4, including CoinList, with others TBC.\n\n# Benefits for Bancor\nThe EFI token launches on exchanges on August 4.\n\nAs one of the first liquidity pools for EFI holders, Bancor has the opportunity to capture a significant portion of its potential volume. The Bancor pool will be highly attractive to EFI token holders during their 9-month vesting period and beyond.\n\nEnjin is a long-term strategic partner of Bancor, having integrated Bancor in the Enjin Wallet in-app exchange, and featuring it on the Enjin Wallet DApp Browser (the app has been downloaded more than 2.3M times). Enjin has a robust community of supports and token holders, with several sub-communities via the 50+ games and apps that have adopted Enjin.\n\nEnjin will work with Bancor to market the existence of the EFI pool to our new EFI token holders (40,000 from the public sale alone), as well as promoting it to the large, existing community of ENJ holders (129,000+).\n\nAs one of the first long-term opportunities for EFI holders have to earn rewards on their ENJ, the Bancor pool will be highly attractive to EFI token holders during their 9-month vesting period and beyond.\n\n# Voter Incentives\n5 randomly drawn voters will receive their choice of Enjin t-shirt, hat, or mug from the [Enjin Merch Shop](https://enjin.io/about/merch-shop-all).",

Reward rate would be similar to that of the FARM/BNT pool, which will see 5k BNT/Week for 8 weeks.\n\n**TL;DR**\n\n*** Enable LM rewards at 5,000 BNT/week for 8 weeks.**\n*** 8 weeks to capture MLN LP’s from the Sushi MLN/WETH pool who are suffering >30% IL.**\n*** Priority is to grow the MLN/BNT pool to be the biggest pool for MLN liquidity.**\n*** 50/50 split rewards on BNT/MLN.**\n*** Enzyme DAO members have contributed over 10,000 MLN to the pool (>$700k) resulting in there being great confidence from the Enzyme community in Bancor’s IL protection mechanism and liquidity provision incentives.**\n\n**Primary Focus of this LM Campaign**\n\nEnzyme Finance has a strong DAO of asset managers that have taken notice of the depth of pools across the Bancor Network and has shown support for Bancor by adding over 10,000 MLN to the BNT/MLN pool increasing pool depth by 35%. The primary focus of this LM campaign will be to target LPs from the Sushi Swap MLN/WETH pool that currently has ~$3.1m in liquidity. https://analytics.sushi.com/pairs/0x2f8ac927aa94293461c75406e90ec0ccfb2748d9\n\nUnfortunately there has been IL >30% by providing liquidity to this pool on Sushi Swap, meaning this LM campaign can serve as a polarizing incentive for MLN LP’s to bring their liquidity to Bancor. Target: >$3.5m in total pool depth on Bancor (Current: $2.1m)\n\n![MLN IL ROI|690x56](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/bancordao/optimized/2X/a/a2dc5b9057544283118ca842495fcd5ae30c9ef5_2_690x56.png)\n![MLN LIQUIDITY|690x334](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/bancordao/optimized/2X/7/75726bf4d0c1889671c05ba77c6a5cc2a98b19f4_2_690x334.png)\n\n**In comparison to other LM campaigns + Benefit to MLN Holders/LP’s:**\n\nIn many ways the idea for this LM campaign was inspired by the success of the FARM/BNT LM campaign, that has managed to pull significant liquidity from Uniswap and bring it, as well as the goal of targeting the buyback mechanism to Bancor, increasing volume, which in turn generates more fees for LP’s. The goal is the same for MLN, however, there is no buyback mechanism (yet), and MLN holders are still looking for the best place to park their MLN holdings with mitigated risk, which as we know, Bancor is that place. This LM campaign would make that a no-brainer and open the door to another $1.55m of MLN liquidity sitting (suffering) on Sushi Swap, along with the increased BNT co-investment from the DAO would open up another $1.6m of MLN liquidity to be deposited. So in just upside alone, there is ~$3.1m (depth of the Sushi pool!) worth of MLN liquidity to go after, making Bancor the default source of liquidity to trade MLN. MLN fees have also shown to have picked up greatly over the last 60-90 days, and show no sign of slowing down, after having being listed on Coinbase as well as Binance, will move activity on-chain for trading, as holders steadily grow - currently at 5,475.\n\n![MLN TOP 100 HOLDERS|690x250](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/bancordao/optimized/2X/8/8f3639e346d8f765024dece52e3f873d8c43b121_2_690x250.png)\n\n![MLN FEE STATS|690x432](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/bancordao/optimized/2X/5/5cddff0d7d096b280bf16f6b117f7629245a8393_2_690x432.png)\n\n\n\n**Public Support, Team/Community Strengthening, & TAM Opportunity.**\n\nIt is no secret that Bancor V3 is well underway, and Enzyme Finance is in the process of finalizing their Sulu (V3) rollout. Both protocols are in the works shipping massive upgrades and appealing to wider and wider user bases. On Enzyme, asset managers (making up its $93m in TVL) can provide liquidity across a variety of platforms (in which they suffer great IL from, depending on the pair) Enzyme asset managers ultimately fit the ethos of the Bancor Network in the sense that they are protecting depositors assets. An ambitious partnership in the future could be LP’ing on Bancor directly from the Enzyme UI, and as treasuries (such as Unslashed Finance’s treasury) get deposited into Enzyme, they will seek vehicles to grow/protect their treasury assets, as DeFi becomes more interoperable, one vehicle could be Bancor in the not-so-distant future. A greater purpose for this LM campaign is further cementing comradery between the Bancor x Enzyme communities and acknowledging the Enzyme DAO’s support for Bancor, as their team would publicly back this proposal and vote.\n\n![MLN TVL|690x57](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/bancordao/optimized/2X/3/33fb024f75e8fde13661f90f85129c5721cb9ff4_2_690x57.png)\n\n\n\n**Voting Options**\n\n1.

This move helped strengthen the ARCONA token and expand our community. In just a week, the liquidity in the pool of the Bancor network exceeded $ 640 thousand, MCap increased x4.5 to 4.5M, and there are still a lot of people willing to contribute assets to the pool. ARCONA seems to be performing well now. ARCONA is now over 30% APY. There is no room in the pool for more ARCONA LPs. There is no active LM rewards on the ARCONA pool, and not everyone interesting add liquidity for second side(BNT) of ARCONABNT.\nTherefore, we propose to vote to increase the size of co-investment from 5 thousand BNT to 50 thousand BNT. The possibility of one-way staking encourages our token holders to use the Bancor protocol more actively and to increase the pool size. As liquidity deepens, so will the yield on swaps for LP.\n\nBy tradition, among all those who voted, regardless of how they vote, we will give away 20 rare NFT Arcona.",

This is based on your proportional ownership of the pool. However, the downside risk of providing liquidity is Impermanent Loss, which is the difference of the coins between entering into a liquidity pool position versus simply holding your coins in your wallet. As the allocation of the coins in a pool changes based on supply and demand, you can end up with more of the undesirable coin.” (From Their FAQ)\n\n(Some of the Analytics)\nScreen Shot 2021-07-21 at 6.27.19 PM\nScreen Shot 2021-07-21 at 6.27.19 PM\n1920×1076 105 KB\nTokenomics\nThe VISION Token is a “Membership” Token.

The contracts and addresses with the highest concentration of BORING tokens are the Huobi, oBTC Tunnel, oLTC Tunnel, oDoge Tunnel and Team’s wallets, Uniswap, MXC, Gate.io.\n\nWe use Triple Layer Formation to protect users’ assets:\n\nThe 1st Layer: When users mint oBTC, oLTC, oDoge, their pledged BTC, LTC, Dogecoin will become the first layer of pledging.\n\nThe 2nd Layer: Whenever one oBTC/ oLTC/ oDoge is being minted, Tunnel will pledge BORING tokens worth 25% of one BTC/ LTC/Dogecoin that has been minted. Every oBTC, oLTC and oDoge is backed up by 125% of crypto assets made up of 100% their corresponding token and 25% of BORING tokens provided by Pledge providers.\n\nThe 3rd Layer: COVER and Nsure provides Insurance service for all the assets in the Tunnel.\n\nProject\n\nBoringDAO deploys a series of decentralised bridges and tunnels that allow you to safely move your Bitcoin & other crypto assets between Ethereum & different blockchains to maximise the utilisation rate of crypto assets in the DeFi world. Currently, oBTC from BoringDAO is the 4th largest BTC-Pegged tokens and one of the largest decentralised BTC-pegged tokens in the DeFi world. BoringDAO uses a unique tunnel mechanism that encourages BORING holders to become pledge providers and participate in the minting process.\n\nThe upcoming product of BoringDAO is oPortal. oPortal is a one-stop solution for token chain-crossing, which can transfer any tokens between different blockchains. oPortal will mobilise your assets and allow every token of yours to engage in any DeFi activities on any blockchains.\n\nTokenomics\n\nBoringDAO’s native token, BORING, deeply participates in the services BoringDAO provides. In the Tunnel, users must pay BORING as a minting fee and redemption fee. In the oPortal, users must pay BORING as a cross-chain fee. BORING holders can pledge their BORING in the Tunnel and receive Pledge Provider Tokens (PP Token), which can be staked in BoringDAO’s farm and generate BORING as rewards.\n\nCommunity and Communication\n\nBoringDAO is active on Twitter, Telegram, Discord, YouTube, and WeChat.\n\nAvailable Audits\n\nBoringDAO has been audited three times since 2020 by reputable auditors:\n\nPeckShield (Dec 2020)\nCertik (May 2021)\nMarket and Trading Data\n\nBORING’s price at the time of writing is $0.0227.\nAll-time high: $0.0554(26th June 2020)\nAll-time low: $0.0225 (2nd July 2017)\n416,048,255 tokens in circulation\n2,000,000,000 maximum supplies.\nThe current market capitalization is $10,148,867.\nThe BORING token is available on major exchanges, including Huobi, Uniswap, Sushiswap, Pancake, Quickswap, DODO, Wault Finance.\nBenefits for Bancor:\n\nBoringDAO will bring more liquidity and trade volume to Bancor and, further, make Bancor the central trading platform of BORING on ERC20. In this way, Bancor would increase activeness and a more prominent reputation.\nWe invite Bancor to join our oPortal programme and build a connection to other blockchains.\nWe will cooperate with Bancor’s marketing activities on social media platforms.",

      "content": "Proposal: Whitelist OriginTrail (TRAC) + 100k Co-Invest\nTL;DR\nProposal to whitelist TRAC.\nProposed co-investment is 100,000 BNT.\nThere are no apparent security concerns that would prohibit whitelist status.\nThere is no reason to doubt the legitimacy of the OriginTrail project. The team has been together since 2011 and the TRAC token has existed since 2018.\nThe benefit to Bancor is clear and a significant amount of volume could move to Bancor quickly.\nTRAC token address: 0xaa7a9ca87d3694b5755f213b5d04094b8d0f0a6f\n\nProject Website: https://origintrail.io/ 5\n\nToken Security\nTRAC does not have an elastic supply, or rebase mechanism. The TRAC contract does not have permissions that grant administrators unrestricted mint/burn capabilities. The TRAC token supply is non-inflationary and fixed at 500,000,000, of which 358,600,000 are in current circulation. The contracts and addresses with the highest concentration of TRAC tokens include two team development fund wallets, a staking contract, the xDai Omnibridge contract, and exchange wallets for Kucoin, Bittrex, and IDEX. The token distribution can be seen at the bottom of the Q1 2020 Quarterly Report 2.\n\nProject\nOriginTrail is a neutral protocol enabling trusted data exchange between companies, organizations, and blockchains. End-to-end information is shared and secured in a fully decentralized knowledge graph network, monitored with AI and oracles. This knowledge graph network utilizes decentralized nodes and an off-chain technology stack to interface with legacy enterprise systems as well as other blockchains. Connecting and searching vast amounts of linked data between organizations (such as in supply chains) in a verified way has not previously been possible.\n\nThe project’s decentralized network has been on mainnet since December 2018. To improve interoperability, the network interacts with a number of blockchains including Ethereum, xDai, Hyperledger Fabric, and [soon] Polkadot. Adoption is catalyzed by building on globally recognized standards for sharing information and data, such as GS1 EPCIS/CBV and W3C.\n\nOriginTrail is working with several top-tier organizations. Together with GS1 (the global barcode registration body), they are developing the next generation EPCIS/CBV 2.0 supply chain standard. The British Standards Institute (BSI) is currently using the OriginTrail protocol to verify audits for 18,000 factories servicing retailers such as Walmart, Home Depot, Walt Disney, and Levi’s. Parity (Polkadot developers) joined the OriginTrail Trace Alliance in late 2020, and the OriginTrail developers were one of just six project talks selected to speak on the main stage at the recent Polkadot Decoded conference.\n\nTokenomics\nOriginTrail’s native token, TRAC (ERC-20), is the glue between all entities and is used as both a stake (to keep data holders/creators honest and data immutable) and a payment (to compensate data holders for their time and resources). Sensitive data can be set to expire and is protected using zero-knowledge methods in a privacy-by-design approach.\n\nTRAC is integral to utilizing the protocol and is used in at least 6 different ways:\n\nEngaging in the OriginTrail ecosystem. Data creators and data holders must have TRAC staked in their nodes to take part in the network. More TRAC staked in nodes means more data jobs can be published or held.\n\nPublishing data to the network. Data creators publish data jobs on the network using TRAC to compensate 3+ data holding nodes for their time and resources. The exact value of TRAC for each data job is dependent on market forces, but parameters like job length and data size affect it. This TRAC is locked in a smart contract until the job’s completion.\n\nCollateralization by Data Holders. To prevent data tampering and as a promise to hold data for a set period of time, TRAC from a data holder’s stake is also locked via smart contract for the length of the data job. Failure to provide data on-demand leads to loss of this staked TRAC to the data creator. Upon completion of the terms of the job, the data holder earns back their original stake AND the TRAC staked by the data creator.\n\nAdditional TRAC Utility is Catalyzed via TRAC Usage on the StarFleet Chain\n\nsTRAC Usage as StarFleet Chain Native Token. StarFleet Chain (SFC) is an upcoming connected blockchain developed by the team to enable cheaper data job transactions on the network. It launches in Q3 2021 and will be a Polkadot parachain. The native token is sTRAC, which is like a “wrapped” form of TRAC for use on Polkadot. No new TRAC tokens are ever created, keeping the supply constant (i.e. the total number of sTRAC + TRAC = 500 million). A bridge will exist to allow easy movement between chains.\n\nStaking sTRAC. Individuals can stake their TRAC on the StarFleet Chain network (in the form of sTRAC) to individual node runners and businesses. Stakers are then able to get a share in the profits of the data job. This locks TRAC into the network for months and years, constricting supply. More info on staking available at staking.origintrail.io 1.\n\nKnowledge Incentivization. The final use-case for TRAC is through a data ecosystem that allows data creators to sell their data on the open market. For example, the recently announced EU-sponsored Food Safety Market aims to develop an industrial data platform for food certification in Europe by 2023. There are also Data Markets being built for both pharmaceuticals and satellite imagery; this has the potential to unlock valuable proprietary siloed data previously thought unsellable.\n\nA tremendous explainer on the protocol, tokenomics, and usecases can be found at OriginTrailExplained.info.\n\nCommunity and Communication\nOriginTrail is active on Medium (blog), Reddit, Telegram, Twitter, and Discord. OriginTrail also has 101 and 102 protocol development courses in the Ivan on Tech Academy, created in collaboration with community member Amos Thomas. Activity on GitHub is frequent, with new updates appearing almost daily. The founders and advisors are presented on the About Us tab on the OriginTrail website. Bob Metcalfe, inventor of Ethernet and Metcalfe’s Law, recently signed on as an advisor. Co-founder Ziga Drev, is the project’s main spokesperson and is quite active on Twitter, as is CTO Branimir Rakic. Since the team is global, the OriginTrail website includes mailing addresses in Slovenia, Serbia, and Hong Kong. There are also multiple contact e-mail addresses:\n\nMailing Address, Ljubljana, Slovenia, Dunajska 156, 1000 Ljubljana\nMailing Address, Belgrade, Serbia, Kosovska 10, 11000 Belgrade\nMailing Address, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Winning Centre, 46–48 Wyndham St, Central\nGeneral Inquiries, office@origin-trail.com\nBusiness Development, alliance@origin-trail.com\nPublic Relations, pr@origin-trail.com\nAvailable Audits\nOriginTrail has been audited for their core ERC-20 protocol contract as well as the Starfleet boarding contract (for connections to Polkadot/Substrate networks):\n\nDLT Labs (2018)\nHosho (2018)\nQuantstamp (2021 - Starfleet Staking Contract)\nMarket and Trading Data\nOriginTrail’s price at the time of writing is $0.22\nAll-time high: $0.90 (March 17th, 2021)\nAll-time low: $0.00385 (March 13th, 2020)\nPrice 90 days ago: $0.58\n358,600,000 tokens in circulation\n500,000,000 maximum supply.\nThe current market capitalization is $79,786,863\nThe TRAC token is available on Uniswap, KuCoin, and Bitforex\nThe 24-hour spot volumes range from $28K (Bitforex) to $121K (KuCoin).\nBenefits for Bancor:\n\nWhitelisting TRAC would bring the deepest TRAC liquidity pool to Bancor. Uniswap is currently the largest LP for TRAC at a value of ~$681K. A trade of 10 ETH causes price slippage of ~5% on the current TRAC/ETH Uniswap pool. Because OriginTrail works with large multinational corporations, it is feasible to assume TRAC may have a higher frequency of large trades.\n\nExchanges have been a huge pain point for the TRAC community and we would welcome any additional sources of liquidity. Even when considering centralized exchanges, KuCoin is the most common exchange for TRAC, which many users do not like due to some trust issues with a previous hack. The community would celebrate a highly respected exchange like Bancor and be a proud partner; a significant amount of exchange volume could move to Bancor overnight. Fireblocks, a token provider for larger investors and business entities, has bought TRAC off open markets before and would probably appreciate another liquidity source as well.\n\nTRAC trading volume should also substantially increase in Q3/Q4 2021. The highly anticipated Starfleet Chain will go live as a parachain (via Polkadot) which should be a catalyst for a large increase in network activity. If Bancor were to whitelist TRAC now, they would likely become the go-to exchange for trading and generate substantial fees for those in the LP.",

Uniswap V2 and Balancer have roughly 5.3M and 1.2M in respective liquidity for the BAT-ETH pair: \n\n![image|634x269](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/bancordao/original/2X/f/f6505c91576a0ba49953121dbc41f88bfead7c48.png)\n\nThe above doesn’t count Uniswap V3 which has  an additional 775K in liquidity on the BAT pool:\n\n![image|423x499](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/bancordao/optimized/2X/8/833bac4c15f61ec1792f47120160e2529bcc49fd_2_423x499.png)\n\nThat's roughly a total of 6M in liquidity on Uniswap for the BAT-ETH pair.\n\nAt the moment we have roughly 2x the liquidity of both of these DEXes combined:\n\n![image|495x330](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/bancordao/original/2X/6/66b9a52a87a305dba23dc1a913ac910cda3077ff.png)\n\nThe fees for these pools are set at .3% for Uniswap and .6% for balancer. I am looking to set the fee for our BAT pool to .2% to match Uniswap (ETH<->BNT<->BAT two hop swap = .3%) and potentially capture some of the smaller trades that are being sent in that direction. At the moment, even though we have a large pool, Uniswap V2 seems to have very similar volume (if not larger for certain days) as compared to us.\n\n![image|690x262](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/bancordao/optimized/2X/e/e9e0fb6e1f74df6b494121df49dd3ee0558a1edd_2_690x262.png)\n\n![image|690x430](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/bancordao/optimized/2X/d/d8573c1bd1aedcfb0f3aa3ac1643ac6050fa14de_2_690x430.png)\n\nMy assumption is that when the price impact on Uniswap exceeds our current pool fee .6% (ETH<->BNT<->BAT) then aggregators will send those trades in our direction.\n\nI think this pool should be capable of more volume but I think that the current fee .5% is holding us back (we have competitors). A quick test for this, when swapping from **BNT** to **BAT** , I am seeing that any amount above 200 BNT (~$600) does not go through Bancor. 1inch essentially is using the USDT/ETH pool (and others) to swap the BNT and then sending it to some other location:\n\n![image|690x186](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/bancordao/optimized/2X/9/97b60759500220fa3a1178abfa2fe45eb61c62fd_2_690x186.jpeg)\n\nwe don’t come into the picture again until the order is roughly ~10K at 20%:\n\n![image|690x175](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/bancordao/optimized/2X/2/268efb7374a76415293438fe677d091e5b7b4dde_2_690x175.jpeg)\n\nSo roughly orders within the range of $600-$10K should hopefully be captured at a higher numbers by us after this change.\n",

The LM rewards on stablecoin pools (DAI, USDC, USDT) are extended from 28th of July until the 28th October (another 12 weeks), and can continue being extended by the DAO.\n2. The LM rewards are extended to maintain current stable pools protocol’s liquidity in anticipation of Bancor V3.\n3. To support the flawless migration, a new liquidity mining program will be released together with the Bancor V3 release.\n\n# Discussion\n\n* At this stage, current protocol growth requires LM to maintain the momentum and stay competitive in the space (the DAO seems aware of this).\n* After achieving the position of market leader in both TVL and volume, LM extension will no longer be necessary, and the voting for LM extensions may be concluded.\n* Bancor V3 will significantly reduce the pressure resulting from insurance on all the assets, and should increase the protocol revenue from trading fees.\n* A large majority of the LM rewards are re-staked to the protocol, increasing the TVL and the space available for TKN deposits with single sided exposure. If this trend continues, the LM program is more of an asset than a liability, and can be managed more assertively.\n* In the long term, Bancor is aiming towards sustainable annual inflation of 2%, in order to achieve that, Bancor requires significant volume and Vortex to be applied.\n\nSummary\n\n* Bancor should not lose the momentum and cut out the LM rewards on stablecoins.\n* The current LM rewards will be changed together with the release of Bancor V3.\n* Current stable tokens liquidity is essential to stay in the ecosystem to maintain the protocol momentum and support the migration of liquidity from v2.1 to V3.",

      "content": "**TLDR**\n\n* This proposal seeks to increase the Co-investment limit to 500K BNT in the QNT pool.\n* It will open up space for LPs on the TKN side (QNT) and potentially increase the depth of the pool as LPs add liquidity\n* A larger QNT pool will attract more trades from aggregators and professional market makers to Bancor which ultimately leads to more fees for our platform.\n\n**For**\n\n1. A larger co-investment limit on the pool will let LPs provided single sided liquidity and will lead to an increase in pool depth\n2. More liquidity in the QNT-BNT pool should lead to larger volume from DEX aggregators and professional market makers sent in our direction\n3. More volume for Bancor leads to more fees for our platform and BNT holders\n\n**Against**\n\n1. We should not increase the limit on the pool.\n\n**Abstract**\nThere is currently 53.7K BNT and 2.1K QNT tokens in the BNT-QNT [pool](https://etherscan.io/address/0x11A9FE753fEe7f8Fd02eFef1a32e81217098D3D0). This has resulted in a pool that has roughly 315K in liquidity. At the moment, LPs on the TKN side (QNT) can’t provide single sided liquidity since there is no capacity. This proposal is seeking to increase single-sided capacity in the QNT pool by increasing the Co-investment limit to 500K BNT.\n\n![image|477x305](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/bancordao/original/2X/c/c036ad9161cc5e7ba798f8c723be262d83c7411e.png)\n\n\n**Motivation**\n\nIf we want to attract more QNT LPs to Bancor, we need to open up space in the pool so that they can provide single sided liquidity. This would allow us to grow the liquidity in the pool and attract larger trades towards our platform which ultimately results in higher fees for Bancor. The QNT pool went live with the release of 2.1 and has recently become popular due to the [coinbase listing](https://blog.coinbase.com/barnbridge-bond-livepeer-lpt-and-quant-qnt-are-launching-on-coinbase-pro-50582f1b6ed0).\n\nThe data for the QNT-BNT pool shows that its protected value has been at around 400K since early March:\n\n![image|689x269](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/bancordao/optimized/2X/d/d51bf72cd57660918ac02a0136b8a363e6e169b1_2_689x269.png)\n\nThis suggest to me that there is demand for LPs on the QNT side to provide liquidity and we should open up space (it has been filled for a while).\n\nThe top pools for QNT are on Uniswap v2 and v3 and are paired with ETH. Cumulative liquidity is roughly ~3M on other DEXes and we should be able to make the Bancor pool deeper to support larger trades with low price impact.\n\n![image|457x500](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/bancordao/optimized/2X/3/375e8478c99c42be9ce194db0b06ff91792820e7_2_457x500.png)\n![image|461x500](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/bancordao/optimized/2X/7/78b9eb09d10f4ecb9a276801751713768186dfb9_2_461x500.jpeg)\n\nCurrently, this pool is filled completely on Bancor and LPs can’t provide single sided liquidity on the TKN side (QNT). I am proposing a 500K Co-investment limit for the QNT pool which should open up roughly 1.5M in single sided liquidity (assuming BNT price at $3.00). If this pools fills up completely, we would have a pool that’s roughly ~3M in depth.",

It empowers developers to interoperate between EVM or EOSIO blockchains, including cross-chain smart contract execution.\n\n## Bancor Polkadot Bridge \n\n[As mentioned in a Bancor blog update in February](https://blog.bancor.network/bringing-bancor-to-polkadot-4a9a0e996916), DAPP Network and EdgeOS will be used by Bancor itself as its cross-chain interoperability solution connecting it’s well known liquidity network to Polkadot.\n\n![|423x448](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/bancordao/optimized/2X/d/d9bdbbc344acb30661144e59afbb3b7d0eb3228f_2_423x448.jpeg)\n\n# Tokenomics\n\nThe DAPP Network’s native token, DAPP, is a utility token which must be staked to access DAPP Network services. Developers stake DAPP to DAPP Service Providers (DSPs) on the network in order to maintain infrastructure and receive a variety of DAPP services such as oracles, cross-chain bridging and IPFS. Token inflation is used to reward DSPs based on the percentage of the total staked DAPP tokens that are being staked to them.\n\n\n# Token Distribution\n\n* 50% of the token supply was distributed during a 1 year long reverse dutch auction.\n* As of today, 45% of tokens are staked for DSP service packages, and there are 8,733 unique holders on EOS.\n* 10% of the token supply was distributed among the EOS community in an “Air-HODL” (vested airdrop).\n* 10% of the token supply was distributed among launch partners, design partners, engagement partners and advisors. All tokens have already been vested and are part of the circulating supply.\n* 10% of the token supply was designated towards the [Grants and Bounties program](https://liquidapps.io/grants). Some of the challenges have been successfully completed, including a global Hackathon, while others are still open.\n* 20% of the token supply was distributed to the company and its Founders.\n\n![image|648x476](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/bancordao/original/2X/4/4d32f9adc6d683b8f046bd818eda644a88158b27.jpeg)\n\n**Source:** https://www.bloks.io/tokens/DAPP-eos-dappservices\n\n\n# Benefits to Bancor Network\n\n## Bancor as the DAPP Liquidity Hub\n\nAs more utility for the DAPP token is realized on Ethereum and developer adoption increases, Bancor will be the go-to source for DAPP which will generate trading fees for Bancor. Bancor will also serve as the liquidity hub which will be used for arbitrage against all other liquidity sources present and future. Pending decisions made through decentralized governance and independent bridge operators, DAPPBNT LP positions could even potentially serve as bridging collateral in the future.\n\n## DAPP Liquidy Mining Rewards for DAPP LPs\n\nLiquidity incentives will be offered to DAPP liquidity providers to encourage them to bridge their tokens to Ethereum and make Bancor the top liquidity source for DAPP tokens on Ethereum. This will drive all DAPP volume and fees on Ethereum to BNT token holders. As DAPP becomes more widely used by Ethereum developers and projects, they will need to come to Bancor to acquire their DAPP tokens, where we would also like to see the deepest liquidity.\n\n## Impermanent Loss Protection Covered using DAPP Tokens\n![External-Loss-Protection|690x256](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/bancordao/optimized/2X/0/0740ad6a80d5044069c246b07da94bb71ee4115d_2_690x256.png)\n\nTypically whitelisted pool IL protection is covered by the protocol, which may potentially create some risk for whitelisting tokens with lower market caps that have a lot of potential to increase in price compared to BNT initially. When this volatility occurs and an LP withdraws, BNT must be minted to cover the impermanent loss that is paid out to the LP. If this LP wants to remain 100% long on their original token, they may then swap their extra BNT for that other token, thereby causing even more impermanent loss for the rest of the liquidity still staked into the pool.\n\nTo offset this risk, an innovative smart contract has been developed that will cover all impermanent loss incurred by LPs when the value of DAPP grows in relation to BNT. Meaning that every time DAPP is unstaked from Bancor, and impermanent loss protection is due to the LP - ***the protection amount will be paid in DAPP instead of BNT, which makes this an attractive proposal for Bancor Network stakeholders.***\n\nEarning DAPP token rewards will require LPs to stake their LP tokens to a reward contract. This contract will burn any BNT that is used to pay for IL when the price of DAPP goes up against BNT, and replace it with DAPP tokens of equal value. BNT will continue to be used to cover any IL to the downside. This sharing of risk greatly benefits BNT holders due to the downside risk for IL protection being limited while the upside risk is potentially unlimited.\n\nThe idea for providing IL protection was conceptualized by Bancor and LiquidApps co-founder Eyal Hertzog before being brought to life by the DAPP Network community. More information on the concept can be found in the [BBS whitelist proposal](https://gov.bancor.network/t/proposal-whitelist-bbs-with-external-il-protection/2067).\n\nThis sharing of the burden of IL protection significantly reduces the risk being taken by Bancor for co-investing 500k BNT. We also hope that by providing our own IL protection, we are helping set a new precedent for future projects whitelisting on Bancor, which will lead to even more cost and risk savings to the network.\n\n![image|690x194](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/bancordao/original/2X/d/df836a74702c43546c6fdf7d56d7ee674c8e0b7f.png)\n\n## Open Source the Native Token IL Protection Mechanism  \n\nThe DAPP Network plans to make this innovative reward mechanism open source, so that additional projects can easily and safely follow in its footsteps.* As liquidity is injected into promising low market-cap projects and initiatives, numerous tokens will be available for trades at lower slippage on Bancor. Since these projects can use the DAPP Network’s solution to cover impermanent loss protection using their native token, the co-investment risk for Bancor is significantly reduced while the potential benefits are maintained. ***DAPP Network is proposing a win-win liquidity bootstrapping solution for all parties, which we hope will help usher in a new generation of liquidity innovation and stakeholder incentive alignment for the ecosystem.***\n\n## vBNT Voter Incentive DeFi NFT\n\nvBNT holders voting on this proposal will be incentivized with an NFT which may have a future utility that allows it to be staked by DAPP LPs to amplify their mining rewards on Bancor. This will give the NFT inherent value for DAPP LPs who wish to maximize yield. ***The code to enable this gamification mechanic will be open sourced*** to allow for other liquidity pools on Bancor to adopt it for creating their own DeFi NFT incentives to drive even more liquidity and engagement to the network.\n\nEvery voter is to be rewarded regardless of their vote.\n\nNFT rewards will only be distributed if the proposal reaches the quorum.\n\n# Token Security\n\nThe DAPP token contract is a standard ERC20 token from the OpenZeppelin library. Neither the [DAPP token contract](https://bloks.io/account/dappservices) on its originating chain, nor any token bridge contracts utilizing the DAPP token, have permissions that grant administrators unrestricted mint/burn capabilities.\n\n\n# Community and Communication\n\n* [Twitter](https://twitter.com/LiquidAppsIO)\n* [DAPP Network Telegram](https://t.me/LiquidAppsIO)\n* [Developer Telegram](https://t.me/dappnetworkdevs)\n* [Governance Telegram](https://t.me/DAPPgovernance)\n* [LiquidApps Blog](https://medium.com/the-liquidapps-blog)\n* [LiquidApps GitHub](https://github.com/liquidapps-io)\n* [DAPP Labs GitHub](https://github.com/DAPPNetworkLabs)",

What they can do is update the token URIs for digitalax token metadata to ensure the quality of the NFT data and safeguard against mistakes— all metadata is stored in a dedicated IPFS gateway. Admins can also mint NFTs, but once a token holder receives that token only them or approved parties to their wallet are able to move it. The contracts and addresses with the highest concentration of $MONA tokens are predominantly the token staking contracts and DIGITALAX multi-sig treasury address. The DIGITALAX dev team performs persistent code peer reviews and unit tests across all deployed code, conforming to contribution guidelines. Each solidity contract is cross reviewed with other Solidity devs on the team to make sure there are no vulnerabilities and funds are safe. We pertain to the latest code and syntax standards and ensure our tests have decent test coverage. We check all the important methods in our code with unit tests to make sure there is no risk that value will be lost at any time. Both $MONA and DIGITALAX tokens are under the leadership of the admin team which also coordinates token rewards and token splits between the different NFT and LP staking pools we operate. DIGITALAX uses a system of primary sale prices to decide the awards that any given user receives in a staking pool.\n\n\n# **Tokenomics**\n$MONA is the core ERC-20 utility for the DIGITALAX ecosystem.\n\nIt is primarily used as:\n\n* The unit of value exchange for Players on the DIGITALAX NFT marketplace to purchase and recharge in-game skins as authentication of their eligibility to play in ESPA casual esports tournaments.\n  * It is their income stream, as they are scored on a leaderboard and receive payouts for successful play.\n* Developers/Modders who showcase content in ESPA, and Designers who create these NFT skins receive $MONA payouts from a split of profits on marketplace sales.\n* $MONA is a payment method on the DIGITALAX “DRIP” marketplace for hybrid digital-physical NFT fashion.\n* It serves the same function for unlockable content bundles within the DIGIFIZZY Magazine.\n* DIGITALAX progresses through stages of deliberate decentralisation, whereby $MONA token and Genesis MONA NFT holders (Governance NFTs distributed at launch of the project) will govern upgrades to the project through votes on proposals across protocol development, monetary, and treasury policies.\n* Genesis MONA NFT and $MONA token holders are eligible to receive a portion of the platform’s marketplace revenue from Auctions and Instant Buy sales. The revenue distribution is derived from protocol fees collected by the platform at the point of sale for assets. This goes live in Q4 2021, upon launch of our new staking and revenue distribution contracts on Polygon.\n\n\nThe Vested Composite NFT product is being made available for sale from the end of July/ early August. It allows the holder to stake it in our new to-be-deployed Polygon staking contracts for a composite yield on profits from the DRIP fashion NFT sales combined with vested $MONA distribution ($MONA = DIGITALAX native ERC-20). This new product specifically gives exposure to this arbitrage between fashion, gaming and decentralised technologies.\n\n* A mix of ERC-20s are accepted on DRIP for purchases of the fashion items. 15% of the profits delivered in this dynamic ERC-20 mix will be distributed as a monthly yield to holders of the composite NFT that they have staked in the new contracts. Eligibility for this profit split allocation is supported for 6 months.\n\n\n**Genesis MONA NFT Distribution**\n![Screen Shot 2021-07-21 at 8.39.25 PM|375x500](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/bancordao/optimized/2X/8/88f5a6ac45cd13e8f17856769586ccef069eff64_2_375x500.png)\n\n\n**$MONA Token Distribution**\n![Screen Shot 2021-07-21 at 8.47.18 PM|690x417](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/bancordao/optimized/2X/3/3cef728ee211dcc037073b1a6fce2f30e23607e5_2_690x417.jpeg)\n\n**Current Holder Distribution**\n![Screen Shot 2021-07-21 at 8.47.42 PM|690x311](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/bancordao/optimized/2X/6/6be1000ad6124a042338b1da04756e21f7aa4edf_2_690x311.jpeg)\n\n# **Community and Ecosystem**\nDIGITALAX’s community consists of designers, developers, modders, gamers, creators and crypto/DeFi enthusiasts.

Broader retail markets are eager for a way to make sense of NFTs, DeFi and web3, but have no current realistic means to get in. DeFi for most people is an obnoxiously complex bit of Voodoo science that inspires a fear they will never be valued fairly or understood. Fashion, on the other hand, intrinsically fulfills a core set of needs and desires, inherent in how we all live, express ourselves and how we define who we are.\n\n**You can get some cool [BANCOR PHYSICAL FASHION NFTS HERE](https://drip.digitalax.xyz/collection/bancor)!!

      "content": "[Read the original proposal on Discourse](https://gov.bancor.network/t/whitelist-apy-vision-vision-token-100k-co-invest/2632)\n\n# **TL;DR**\n\n* Whitelist VISION Token by APY.vision\n* 100K BNT Co-Investment.\n* There are no apparent Security Concerns.\n* High Synergy between products.\n\n**Website** : https://v2.apy.vision/\n\n**Contract Address** : 0xf406f7a9046793267bc276908778b29563323996\n\n# **Project**\n\n“APY.vision is an all-in-one dashboard to manage your DeFi Liquidity Pools and track your Impermanent Losses/Gains in real time. We support different decentralize exchanges (ie: AMMs) such as Uniswap, Balancer, and Sushiswap. More AMMs will be supported in the future.\n\nBy providing liquidity to a pool (by contributing the pool's required tokens), you are earning a fee from all the trades (aka swaps), usually at 0.3% of the trade. This is based on your proportional ownership of the pool. However, the downside risk of providing liquidity is Impermanent Loss, which is the difference of the coins between entering into a liquidity pool position versus simply holding your coins in your wallet. As the allocation of the coins in a pool changes based on supply and demand, you can end up with more of the undesirable coin.” (From Their FAQ)\n\n(Some of the Analytics)\n![Screen Shot 2021-07-21 at 6.27.19 PM|690x386](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/bancordao/optimized/2X/5/52efd81c56945dd02cd1839c87fa611d15a84654_2_690x386.jpeg)\n\n# **Tokenomics**\n\nThe VISION Token is a “Membership” Token. In order for people to use their analytic tools they have to be either Holding VISION Tokens or LPing. For every 1 VISION Token held a wallet can track 100$ Worth of LP, and this tracking is boosted by 5X for LPers. It would not be unreasonable for the Vision Team to use Bancor Liquidity the same way.\n\nPRO offering will enable:\n* Real-time price quotes (free members get refreshed quotes every hour)\n* Remembering previous addresses\n* Grouping wallet addresses into one single account view\n* Expedited query speeds (your queries will be prioritized)\n* Viewing historical gain/losses (free members can only see current liquidity pool positions)\n* Tracking Total APY and returns with farming rewards included (a common use case for LPs that farm with staking contracts) *\n* Pool Insights advanced search (min 2000 VISION tokens)\n* Dark mode option\n* Daily summary emails *\n* Additional AMMs\n* Vote for new features (min 2000 VISION tokens)\n* Dedicated #gold channel on Discord (min 2000 VISION tokens)\n\n![Screen Shot 2021-07-21 at 8.25.48 PM|690x367](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/bancordao/optimized/2X/6/6d75c67137523cc4f2eaf7009edde4705c7e62f4_2_690x367.png)\n\n# **Token Security**\n\nThe VISION Token does not have an elastic supply or rebasing mechanism. There is a maximum of 5,000,000 VISION Tokens with 900,000 of them in circulation. The Token contract Is not upgradable and conforms to other security requirements. The token contract does have a pausibility feature but I’ve confirmed that this was used for the pre-sale.\n\n![Screen Shot 2021-07-21 at 7.48.58 PM|690x367](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/bancordao/optimized/2X/8/84f9f12ac8d35cbc2ecce872447a2ba6e4a9fdbe_2_690x367.png)\n\n\n# **Co-Investment Reasoning and Benefits to Bancor**\n\nThere are currently two pools live for the VISION Token on Uniswap and Quickswap, the bigger one being UNI. The initial Co-Investment should allow us to grow to a comparable size but assuming we see some LPs shift from UNI to Bancor we could perhaps see our pool be just as big if not bigger. It’s not unreasonable for us to assume these highly IL Conscious holders to want to be protected from the risk of IL.\n\n![Screen Shot 2021-07-21 at 6.34.00 PM|690x291](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/bancordao/optimized/2X/4/421d29f5bf57a7ca6fd3cfb578008f479477004a_2_690x291.jpeg)\n![Screen Shot 2021-07-21 at 6.34.06 PM|690x291](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/bancordao/optimized/2X/3/31472c0c19c09ceeeb602b4810938f30ab2c4d92_2_690x291.jpeg)\n\n\nI personally could not think of a project with users as well aligned with Bancor advantages as APYs and their Site is a constant source for me to draw informations on different pair’s IL Across multiple DEXs. The possibilities for further collaboration are 100% there and I think we could reach an audience highly conscious of IL.\n\nFurthermore, the Vision Pair would also be a clear beneficiary of IL Protection and Single Sided Staking by the current UNI Pair.\n\n![Screen Shot 2021-07-21 at 6.38.37 PM|690x376](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/bancordao/optimized/2X/f/f8347579786bbe001429fb71e000346252811686_2_690x376.png)\n\n# **Price and Stats**\n\n|VISION Price|$3.21|\n| --- | --- |\n|Market Cap|$2,970,267|\n|Market Cap Dominance|0.00%|\n|Trading Volume|$565,756|\n|Volume / Market Cap|0.1916|\n|24h Low / 24h High|$2.90 / $3.28|\n|7d Low / 7d High|$2.15 / $3.27|\n\n# **Community and Communication**\n\nDiscord : https://discord.com/invite/ePfGAYbqUq\n\nTwitter : https://twitter.com/ApyVision\n\nBlog : https://blog.apy.vision/",

Alchemix has a very strong community, and only one DEX liquidity pool (Sushi Swap, ALCX/ETH) this is an ideal opportunity to open up a ALCX/BNT pool, with IL protection and in the near future depending on trade volume, activate LM rewards.\n* V1 audited by Certik, V2 is in the works for launch.\n\nProject Site: https://alchemix.fi/\n\nContract Address: 0xdbdb4d16eda451d0503b854cf79d55697f90c8df\n\nToken Security\n\nALCX is the governance token for the Alchemix protocol. Its supply increases when users claim new tokens they've earned by staking liquidity in the various pools above. The total supply will continue to increase over time, in line with the emissions schedule. The ALCX governance token's distribution is carefully crafted to gradually reduce issuance over the course of three years, continuing with a long tail of fixed weekly emissions. See chart below for weekly emissions + supply curve. ALCX is not an elastic supply token or does not have a rebase mechanism.The ALCX contracts do not have permissions that grant administrators unrestricted mint/burn capabilities.\n\n![ALCX Supply Emissions|690x383](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/bancordao/optimized/2X/a/a8a0de915935c529bfec947349d887bc7864e071_2_690x383.jpeg)\n\nProject\n\nImagine a bank. You can deposit money, and the bank pays you 10-15% interest. There's a credit card attached to the account, with a credit limit of 50% of the amount you have deposited. There's no interest on the card. There are no monthly payments to make. Instead, the interest you earn on your balance pays off any debt you have, automatically, or “automagically”.\n\nAlchemix is a new kind of DeFi/lending protocol built on Ethereum. It combines aspects of MakerDAO, Yearn, Curve, and Sushi in a novel way to create \"self-paying\" loans. It is built on Ethereum, and launched in late February of 2021. The Alchemist is the primary way users interact with Alchemix. This smart contract accepts DAI deposits from users and issues debt in alUSD. It also allows users to repay their outstanding loans, either with alUSD, DAI, or their existing collateral (DAI, and most recently ETH). There is no interest on the alUSD loan. There are no liquidations. Deposited DAI is put to work earning yield in the Yearn v2 DAI vault. The earned yield pays off your alUSD debt.\n\nTo read more about how Alchemix work and platform data, read here:\n\nhttps://dyor.fi/alcx\n\nhttps://alchemix.fi/c76d1d663f6c8247b86a8fca83d5bd1b.pdf\n\n![ALCX Holders (Addresses)|690x207](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/bancordao/optimized/2X/8/886d1d3977814068751f0fa9ebf52a546007dae2_2_690x207.jpeg)\n\nCo-Investment reasoning\n\nCurrently, the only pool for ALCX is on Sushi Swap which is where the vast majority of ALCX trade volume comes from, and none of the LP’s have any protection against Impermanent Loss as Bancor can help provide. This opens the door to ~$60m of liquidity that is currently provided in ALCX tokens on Sushi Swap, and $107.3m in trade volume over the last 30 days alone, see chart below for liquidity + 30-day volume. With a co-investment of 250,000 BNT (~$737.5k of liquidity) we can become the only other competitor to the Sushi pool and even make our way towards becoming the preferred platform to trade ALCX & provide liquidity to earn trading fees in ALCX and have impermanent loss protection, which is not currently an option for ALCX LP’s.\n\n![ALCX Sushi Swap Liquidity + Volume|690x285](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/bancordao/optimized/2X/4/4e2e26671bef1d14bc44e9745eaa971af74330eb_2_690x285.jpeg)\n\n**Alchemix Market Data**\n\n*Alchemix Price | $279.32*\n\n*Price Change 24h | $-15.46 (-5.24%)*\n\n*24h Low / 24h High | $276.32 / $297.34 *\n\n*Trading Volume 24h | $2,462,549.54 *\n\n*Volume / Market Cap | 0.03108 *\n\n*TVL | $827,861,050*\n\n*Market Cap/TVL Ratio | 0.09661*\n\n*All Time High | $2,066.20 (-86.2%)*\n\n*All Time Low | $255.02 (+11.6%)|*\n\nCommunity & Communication\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/AlchemixFi?s=20\n\nDiscord: https://t.co/f1dYGqkNBq?amp=1\n\nGithub: https://github.com/alchemix-finance\n\nForum: https://forum.alchemix.fi/public\n\nOfficial Docs: https://alchemix-finance.gitbook.io/alchemix-finance/\n\nY.at: https://t.co/I3EpXuso0l?amp=1\n\nSecurity Audit\n\nInspect Alchemix’s Certik audit here: https://alchemix.fi/a208baf6ca7e0d6b0116461f05e27cd9.pdf\n\nBenefits for Bancor & Alchemix\n\n* Giving ALCX stakers access to deeper liquidity via the Bancor Network will allow Bancor to tap into a unique protocol in the lending/borrowing niche that will allow its token holders (ALCX holders) to essentially hedge their productive asset from IL with Bancor’s Impermanent Loss protection mechanism. Many users interacting with the Alchemix platform are tapping into loans and utilizing them across the entire DeFi ecosystem. It would be in Bancor’s best interest to give the wizards of Alchemix a place to park their precious ALCX and generate passive, protected yield with it.\n\n* The whitelisting of ALCX would allow Bancor to tap into Alchemix’s very strong, passionate, and rapidly growing community. Alchemix is drawing the attention of some of the space's largest players, whether it be lenders/borrowers, or non-crypto natives such as Mark Cuban, who is now publicly a fan of Alchemix for example. This would generate massive attention for both Bancor, and Alchemix. This pool would easily become the only other competitor to Sushi who is not offering what Bancor offers. Together, both platforms boast a massive ~$2.1 billion in TVL.\n\n* Alchemix has extremely interesting things in the works, for example, how they’ll be structuring their DAO, they plan to give token holders/DAO participants characters and a point system that is non-transferrable (outside of Alchemix, but they can delegate their points) which will allow/incentivize unique, consistent participation in the DAO, a co-founder of Alchemix mentions that DAO’s currently are “boring” and “don’t do enough to attract its participants to come, check in daily and interact with the DAO and continue submitting and voting on proposals.” - This is beneficial for Bancor because as token emissions of ALCX increase, and holders of the token increase, they will be looking for a place to generate yield with their tokens as the platform's popularity grows. Bancor could become the one stop shop for ALCX holders that want to provide liquidity with their tokens. - This type of activity and attention from a founder is exactly the type of commitment to growth that we would want to work with, and not only would the communities grow fond of eachother, but both parties, Bancor & Alchemix, would mutually benefit from a platform exposure perspective.\n\nProposal created by [@_krris](https://twitter.com/_krris), [@tenzents](https://twitter.com/Tenzents?s=20), [@patfitzgerald01](https://twitter.com/patfitzgerald01?s=20)\n\nThank you for your consideration and time.",

The hybrix contract does not\nhave permissions that grant administrators unrestricted mint/burn capabilities. The HY token supply is fixed at 7,000,000, of which 2,295,344 are in current circulation. The contracts and addresses with the highest concentrations of HY tokens are the deployer supply pool, the Uniswap pairs, our largest crowdfund holders, one of the Biki wallets, the Balancer supply, and two of the team’s wallets.\n![image|690x260](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/bancordao/optimized/2X/2/26f1976bd6508d7b0e138821aee43679bb01d951_2_690x260.jpeg)\n\n# Project\nThe hybrix project provides a multi-ledger API and swapping mechanism. Hybrix is a\ndistributed swapping network comprised of allocators that provides cross-ledger liquidity. The hybrix protocol enables one token to exist on multiple ledgers, which is called a unified asset. It is technically borderless, not restricted to a single distributed blockchain, DAG, or other digital ledger.\n\n# Tokenomics\nHybrix’s native token, HY (ERC20), is required to participate in being part of the swap\nnetwork as an allocator. Allocators utilize HY as a security reserve, ensuring that trades\nacross ledgers cannot be front-run. HY does not need its own blockchain, and instead uses other chains to move value. Allocators must pay matcher nodes HY to get matching swaps on their pairs. Therefore, the HY token is a useful utility token, and not only a symbolic representation of the project. Our full and detailed tokenomics document is available on our website https://hybrix.io.\n\n# Community and Communication\nHybrix is active on Reddit, Telegram, and Bitcointak. The hybrix team also operates official Twitter and Youtube accounts. Activity on Gitlab is frequent, and releases are done on Github, with new updates appearing every week. The development team and advisors are presented on the community part of the hybrix.io website. Joachim de Koning is the project’s founder and main spokesperson. The hybrix project business development is done by hy.company, which is incorporated in the Netherlands.\n\nMailing address:\n  hybrix\n  Keurenplein 41 unit E725\n  1069 CD\n  Amsterdam\n  the Netherlands\n\nSecurity email: security@hybrix.io\nTechnical support email: support@hybrix.io\nBusiness queries: contact@hy.company\nPress email: press@hybrix.io\n\n# Market and Trading Data\n* hybrix’s price at the time of writing is $2.16\n* All-time high: $12.44 (17th April 2021)\n* All-time low: $0.33 (29th January, 2021)\n* Price 90 days ago: $1.63\n* 2,295,344 tokens in circulation\n* 7,000,000 maximum supply.\n* The current market capitalization is $4,756,453.\n* The HY token is available on the following exchanges: Biki, Uniswap, Pancakeswap,\n* Luaswap, Balancer, Mooniswap, pDEX, TomoDEX\n* The 24-hour spot volume is on average: $10k\n\n# Token Audit\nWe have no token audit, as our Ethereum contract is standard ERC20, with no added bells and whistles. Our cross-chain swapping mechanism is written in hybrix scripting language Qrtz, and available in our repository. All code is open source, and our contract has been verified on Etherscan.\n\n# Benefits to Bancor\nWhitelisting hybrix with a 100k BNT co-investment would make Bancor the deepest pool of hybrix. Since we list almost solely on decentralized exchanges we expect this listing to generate a considerable amount of volume and publicity for Bancor. Aside from that we will make BNT swappable to other currencies cross-chain in the hybrix ecosystem.\n\n# Voter Incentives\nWe would be honored and glad if you would vote for our project. For three of those who vote, we will be sending you a hybrix T-shirt, and we will select one person to receive a hybrix hardware node that can be plugged in to run your own secure hybrix ecosystem.

Effect on the network of the underlying limits increase will be tightly monitored.\n\n### The anticipated positive effects are:\n\n1. An immediate increase in TVL.\n\nIncreased co-investment limits allow for additional single-sided token staking by both WBTC holders. WBTC pool currently has a limited capacity to attract WBTC in big chunks. We witnessed a higher than usual demand and requested from big market players to stake WTBC with Bancor.\n\n2. An increase in the Bancor Vortex burn rate.\n\nWBTC, similar to ETH pool has proved a minimal insurance liability during the initial phase of V2.1. Trade WBTC revenue is a  relevant contributor to Bancor Vortex burning protocol. Increasing the co-investment limit will increase trading volume and Bancor Vortex burns activity.\n\n3. Passive staking of WBTC.\n\nMore and more institutional investors are looking for a safe place to stake their WBTC,  Bancor, so far Bancor is one of the safest places with attractive WBTC denominated yield. There are no other places with risk-free decent yields on WBTC. Therefore we have seen increased demand for WBTC staking\n\n### Summary:\n\nWBTC pool is one of the most important pools on BNT. It has been proven a low IL liability with a high upside for the network. WBTC pool not only aggregates a sufficient amount of Bancor liquidity but also collects a relevant amount of fees responsible for vBNT burnt in Vortex.\nThe careful limit increase will allow luring capital from big and long term players on the market that will not only support protocol TVL but also network fees increase the Vortex burn rate.",

At the current depth of our pool (656,000 USD Worth of FARM) this would mean we would need to add 2,144,000 USD worth of FARM to our pool, which translates to 35,275 FARM.\n\n![Screen Shot 2021-07-06 at 4.10.49 PM|690x287](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/bancordao/optimized/2X/3/3921c6f4cc81ab7f61fccce5eb9fc4b90751d242_2_690x287.jpeg)\n\n# How does it compare to other LM Campaigns?\nWhere most LM on bancor before has historically seen a flat 12 week long program and 10,000-20,000 BNT minted per week (2x Multiplier after 4 Weeks), this proposal gives the DAO a lot more flexibility to cut off inflation while at the same time lowering the emissions to as low as a sixth of that of the previous minimum. This means that compared to a typical campaign where, at the very least, we are minting 240,000 BNT this LM Event only emits 40,000 - 80,000 BNT at it's highest.\n\n# What does 5,000 BNT / 8 Week Period do ?\n**This has been discussed extensively here and is in some ways our first test should the DAO Vote to Pass it.** ([Link](https://gov.bancor.network/t/draft-proposal-use-ranked-choice-voting-for-duration-of-liquidity-mining-campaigns/2515/17))\n\n5,000 BNT per week annualized on our target liquidity of 2,800,000 USD at current prices of 3.5$ per BNT translates to 34%~ APY divided between BNT and FARM (so 17% For Each Side). This APY was targeted specifically because it mirrors the incentives on Harvest’s ETH/FARM Uniswap Pair. Assuming we are successful in siphoning both the liquidity of this pair and the volume from the Buy-Back mechanism there should be no reason why the incentives should not be instead moved into Bancor.\n\n# Benefits to FARM-ers\n\nFarmers in the ETH/FARM Pool will no longer suffer from impermanent loss, on top of this their yield will be further diversified into BNT which can be compounded back into the pool or others to earn great yields. All ETH/FARM LPs will also no longer be forced to cut their position in half with ETH and will be free to use the other half of their position in other things or simply have a larger share of FARM all while earning trading fees and LM Incentives (and perhaps harvest's own incentives ?).\n\n# Goals\n> This campaign should be considered successful if : \n- The pool's depth grew larger than that of Uniswap, which has 2,800,000 USD Worth of FARM in it (35K Farm at current Prices). \n- The FARM Buyback Mechanism is moved over to Bancor.\n- **Optional** : Would be nice to see Harvest move their FARM incentives over to the Bancor Pool from Uniswap, or some other form of reciprocity.\n\n# Voting Options\n\n1.

The DRC token supply is fixed at 1,000,000,000, of which all 1,000,000,000 tokens (100% of the total token supply) are in current circulation. The ownership of DRC is well distributed among ~3,000 token holders. The contracts and addresses with the highest concentration of DRC tokens are Uniswap and Matic LP addresses. Uniswap V3 liquidity is currently provided by the DRC founder (~5% of the total token supply) and will be moved to Bancor, if the whitelisting proposal is approved by the Bancor community.\n\n![Picture1|440x224](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/bancordao/original/2X/d/d2871bb541af3645a6a45b63d8c9eb167b271779.png)\n\n**Project**\n\nDigital Reserve Currency (DRC) is a decentralized digital store of value with the fixed supply and a zero-inflation rate. The project was launched in September 2020 and did not have any security or other issues since its creation. DRC ecosystem is fully decentralized, and no one has control over DRC besides its community.\n\nDRC token has intrinsic value not only because of its fixed supply, but also because of the unique utility of providing exclusive access to the [Digital Reserve](https://drcglobal.org/platform/), a decentralized platform where users can get easy exposure to the well-balanced baskets of the most efficient Store of Value (SoV) assets to preserve their capital and hedge inflation risks.\n\n[The DRC Foundation](https://drc.foundation/) and [The DRC Foundation Fund](https://drc.foundation/fund/) have been established to support the growth and development of the DRC ecosystem. DRC is a fully transparent and compliant project, because of it’s fair token distribution model and a decentralized structure.\n\n\n**Tokenomics**\n\nThe total supply of DRC is fixed at 1,000,000,000 indivisible ERC-20 tokens. 100% of the total DRC token supply has been issued directly to the secondary market in 2020.\n\nNo DRC tokens have ever been premined or retained by the project founders or developers. DRC has a predetermined finite supply and no more additional DRC tokens will ever be minted. The scarcity of DRC was embedded into the code and nothing can change it once DRC contract was deployed into Ethereum network.

      "title": "Whitelist xSUSHI with 200k BNT Coinvestment",
      "content": "For this proposal to pass, it requires 35% quorum and 66.7% supermajority.\n\n# TL;DR\n\n* Proposal to whitelist SushiSwap xSUSHI.\n* Co-investment of 200,000 BNT.\n* There are no apparent security concerns that would prohibit whitelist status.\n* There is no reason to doubt the legitimacy of the SushiSwap project.\n* The benefit to Bancor is clear. Interest in whitelisting xSUSHI came from the recent whitelisting of wstETH, which works in a similar manner to xSUSHI. Attracting volume from the SushiBar might bring Sushi users to Bancor as well as more fees and visibility to the protocol.\n\n### Token Address: [0x8798249c2E607446EfB7Ad49eC89dD1865Ff4272](https://etherscan.io/token/0x8798249c2E607446EfB7Ad49eC89dD1865Ff4272)\n\n### Project Website: https://sushi.com/\n\nDeepest and only xSUSHI pool is xSUSHI/ETH on SushiSwap with a $12,733,899.18 liquidity (Figure 1).\n\n![image|690x82](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/bancordao/original/2X/5/5e34a24f9c741daeb434d039519be6fa3fb8f3cd.png)\nFigure 1 - Exchanges that trade xSUSHI. Taken from https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/xsushi#markets.\n\n# Token Security\n\nxSUSHI is minted when SUSHI is deposited in the SushiBar. The xSUSHI contract is a standard OpenZeppelin ERC-20 contract. The contracts don't have any permissions that grant administrators unrestricted mint/burn capabilities.\n\nxSushi doesn't have a supply cap but it's supply is limited to the capped-supply of SUSHI, thus no more than 250,000,000 xSUSHI can ever exist. The top 15 contracts and addresses with the highest concentration of SUSHI tokens are the token contract, the SushiBar contract, Binance, and several wallets. It should be noted that three private wallets in the top 5 holders collectively own approx. 16.48% of the xSUSHI tokens  (Figure 2). Finally, being able to be used as a collateral on AAVE brings some confidence on the security of xSUSHI.\n\n![image|690x308](upload://drnEj0m8tJSVU5rpEX8RfNPSvnv.png)\nFigure 2 - Top 10 holders of xSUSHI, taken from https://etherscan.io/token/0x8798249c2E607446EfB7Ad49eC89dD1865Ff4272.\n\n\n# Project\n\nSushiSwap (SUSHI) is an automated market maker, launched in September 2020 as a fork of Uniswap and aims to diversify the AMM market and also add additional features not previously present on Uniswap, such as increased rewards for network participants via its in-house token, SUSHI.\n\nThe platform takes a 0.3% cut from transactions occurring in its liquidity pools, while its SUSHI token is used to reward users portions of those fees. SUSHI also entitles users to governance rights.\n\n# Tokenomics\n\n[xSUSHI](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/xsushi) is a token similar to our SushiSwap's Liquidity Provider tokens, that you receive in exchange for staking SUSHI tokens in the Sushibar. While holding the token, it will appreciate in value, as fees from the SushiSwap exchange platform are \"served to the Sushibar\". The xSUSHI token is always worth more than a regular SUSHI token.\n\n# Community and Communication\n\nSUSHI is active on [Reddit ](https://reddit.com/r/SushiSwap)and [Discord](https://discord.gg/hJ2p555). The SushiSwap team also operates official [Twitter ](https://twitter.com/sushiswap) and [Medium](https://medium.com/@sushiswapchef/the-sushiswap-project-dd6eb80c6ba2) accounts. [Github](https://github.com/sushiswap/sushiswap) activity is frequent.\n\n# Available Audits\n\nThe xSUSHI ERC-20 token contract is a standard OpenZeppelin contract. SushiSwap contracts have been audited by [Peckshield](https://github.com/peckshield/publications/blob/master/audit_reports/PeckShield-Audit-Report-SushiSwap-v1.0.pdf), [Quantstamp](https://github.com/quantstamp/sushiswap-security-review) and others.\n\n# Market and Trading Data [1]\n\n* xSUSHI’s price at the time of writing is $7.89.\n* All-time high: $26.33 (13th Mar, 2021).\n* All-time low: $6.04 (22nd Jan, 2021).\n* Price 90 days ago: $18.47.\n* 61,321,260 tokens in circulation.\n* The current market capitalization is $483,702,420.\n* The xSUSHI token is only available on Sushiswap.\n* The 24-hour volume of the Sushiswap xSUSHI/ETH pools is $2,052,525. This volume translates to 24hr collected fees of $6,058.33. The yearly fees collected are 8.73% of the $12,733,899.18 liquidity.

      "title": "whitelist TRIBE token with 200k BNT co-investment",
      "content": "**Summary:**\n\n* Proposal to whitelist TRIBE (TRIBE), activating single-sided exposure and protection from IL.\n* Proposed co-investment of 200,000 BNT\n* TRIBE is an extremely liquid token that has no apparent security concerns that might jeopardize whitelisting\n* Fei Protocol is a highly legitimate project backed by some of the biggest names in Crypto\n* TRIBE will not add major risk to the Bancor Protocol\n\nContract address: [0x514910771af9ca656af840dff83e8264ecf986ca](https://etherscan.io/token/0xc7283b66Eb1EB5FB86327f08e1B5816b0720212B)\n\nProject Website: https://fei.money/\n\n**[Project]**\n\nFEI is a scalable and decentralized stablecoin that leverages protocol controlled value (PCV) for peg maintenance while maintaining highly liquid secondary markets. Fei Protocol consists of two tokens, the first being FEI, the stablecoin, and the second being TRIBE, the governance token, governing the PCV currently valued at $519 million.\n\nFei Protocol has developed technical and security improvements multiple times after launch such as running consistent fuzzing campaigns with ConsenSys Diligence and the code is currently undergoing another full audit by OpenZeppelin.\n\n**[ Token Distribution ]**\n\n![|624x351](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/bancordao/optimized/2X/1/107d4b27fbd778ae2ab06d68979492f063082efe_2_624x351.png)\n\nTRIBE’s IDO was one of the seminal events of DeFi in 2021, and correspondingly, TRIBE has an almost unrivaled diversity of token distribution for such a new project. TRIBE boasts 11,462 holding addresses [3], and intense activity amongst its governance process. In fact FIP-1 and FIP-6 of TRIBE were defeated with massive turnout and by tight margins, proving the meaningful diversity of ownership and opinions of TRIBE holders.\n\n![|624x268](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/bancordao/optimized/2X/3/3381d485f70a1e6876cf1e05d9d9fdc0c24eda55_2_624x268.png)\n\nAmongst the top 10 holding addresses, the largest holder represents non circulating DAO treasury. In the case of”Uniswap V2 FEI-TRIBE”, it represents the 5-year time locked tokens held by the core team and investors. Other significant holders include the staking rewards distributor contract. For all intents and purposes the above addresses do not vote, nor do they presently have any liquidity. Furthermore, the contract “Fei Protocol: Staking” represents a large number of different owners who have staked their tokens in the official liquidity mining incentives program.\n\nRead more here: https://medium.com/fei-protocol/the-tribe-token-distribution-887f26169e44\n\n**[ Tokenomics ]**\n\n![|624x351](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/bancordao/optimized/2X/a/a152986169d8651160e00e129841e0be456f38fa_2_624x351.png)\n\nTRIBE total supply is fixed at 1,000,000,000, with just under a quarter currently circulating. The team and investors are time locked for 4-5 years, ensuring their commitment to the long term wellbeing of the project. Staking rewards for the FEI-TRIBE LP would only be released over a 2 year period. Any disposition of the DAO treasury (currently non-circulating) would require DAO voting to go forward.\n\n**[ Community and Communication ]**\n\nFei Protocol has an active and passionate community of over 10,000 users centered on Discord https://discord.gg/tG8XFggz and Wechat,\n\nDocumentation: http://docs.fei.money/\n\nWe have an active Github, source code: https://github.com/fei-protocol\n\nEthereum addresses contracts, https://docs.fei.money/protocol/contract-addresses\n\naudits both procedural and smart contract focused, Audits: [https://docs.fei.money/audit\n](https://docs.fei.money/audit)An updated version of the protocol is currently undergoing another audit\n\nCommunity Forum: https://discord.com/invite/2prhYdQ5jP  & https://tribe.fei.money/\n\n**[ Token Security ]**\n\nFEI Protocol complies with both the administrative and technical requirements of whitelisting at Bancor. TRIBE has seen extremely robust DAO action and community voting is firmly in charge of the direction of the protocol. The multi-sig controlled “Guardian Protocol” as outlined by the white paper has only been used once to pause an exploited functionality and has since been upgraded and fixed per DAO voting subsequently.\n\nTRIBE token contract is not upgradeable, nor could anybody except for the holders themselves burn their own tokens. TRIBE supply is fixed at 1 Billion. Though mentioned in the white paper, the emergency inflationary buyback is not currently implemented, since FEI currently has a collateral ratio of over 275%, it is very unlikely it will ever happen. TRIBE’s token transfer can’t be paused and isn’t subject to any transfer fees or burn penalties during buying or selling.\n\nFEI Protocol has been the subject of multiple professional audits by premier firms such as Open Zeppelin and ConsenSys Diligence, and subject to further extensive auditing throughout its security updates.\n\nFEI Protocol also maintains an active bug bounty program which offers up to $1M for critical vulnerabilities to the smart contract. Our bug bounty program has been already successful in preempting major losses to protocol value. [8]\n\nYou can read about the audit specifics in the references below [5] [6] [7]\n\n**[ Benefits to Bancor ]**\n\nEnabling TRIBE IL protection and single sided exposure with a 200,000 BNT co-investment would generate a considerable amount of volume and publicity for Bancor. FEI and Bancor’s dedicated and robust communities can in turn add to each other’s exposure and utility. Whitelisting TRIBE will also pave the way for a future Bancor 3.0 integration with the FEI stablecoin, facilitating the use of a truly decentralized stablecoin.\n\n**[ Market and Trading Data ]**\n\n* TRIBE’s price at the time of writing is $0.5905\n* All-time high: $3.26 (Apr 04, 2021)\n* All-time low: $0.58 (Jun, 28, 2021)\n* 248,364,400 tokens in circulation\n* 1,000,000,000 maximum supply.\n* The current market capitalization is $148,151,795.\n* The 24-hour spot volumes range from $289,668 (Uniswap v2) to $32,216 (Gate.io).\n* The TRIBE token is available on various exchanges, including Uniswap V2 (FEI and TRIBE are the 1st and 2nd most liquid pairs on Uni V2), Gate.io, CoinEX, Hoo, MEXC\n\n![|624x175](upload://3RmqD8NXko2ryTpCdv7DZLIEJ0T.png)\n\n**[ References ]**\n\n[1] https://etherscan.io/token/0xc7283b66Eb1EB5FB86327f08e1B5816b0720212B\n\n[2] https://app.fei.money/analytics\n\n[3] https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/tribe/holders/\n\n[4]https://etherscan.io/token/tokenholderchart/0xc7283b66Eb1EB5FB86327f08e1B5816b0720212B\n\n[5] https://medium.com/fei-protocol/fei-bonding-curve-bug-post-mortem-98d2c6f271e9\n\n[6] https://blog.openzeppelin.com/fei-protocol-audit/\n\n[7] https://consensys.net/diligence/audits/2021/01/fei-protocol/\n\n[8] https://docs.fei.money/bug-bounty",

We have an in-house and outsourced marketing team who can promote the pool to a wider audience via active outreach and encourage engagement via our various social media platforms. We have also begun a rollout of weekly webinars which promotes the projects of those who we work with, including a discussion on “NFTs & the Chasm” featuring Bancor’s Nate Hindman as a panelist.

      "content": "* The Liquidity Mining program was a proven success with adding over $10,000,000 of liquidity to the BAT pool. We saw several large whales join the Bancor Protocol due to this proposal.\n\n* The program also allowed Bancor's BAT pool to have the deepest liquidity pool for BAT compared to all DEX. See below for a recent snapshot comparison. Current depth on BNT is $15,000,000+. \n\n![IMG_6392|690x434](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/bancordao/original/2X/8/84a5a081fbaea64ba228d8e11185e5c3c06014b5.jpeg)\n\n\n* By adding the LM rewards, we also saw fees increase significantly.

We grew liquidity and fees increased, as this program is intended to do. \n\nThe reasoning to extend LM on BAT is to retain this liquidity. If we do not extend LM, there are higher yielding platforms for the BAT holders to move their funds to. We will lose a significant amount of the liquidity we gained and fees will go down. \n\nVote FOR to extend LM on BAT for an additional 12 weeks. \nVote AGAINST to not re-new LM on BAT.",

Each money market is unique to an Ethereum asset (such as Ether, an ERC-20 stablecoin such as Dai, or an ERC-20 utility token such as ChainLink), and contains a transparent and publicly-inspectable ledger, with a record of all transactions and historical interest rates.\n\n**Staking**\nCurrently, Compound Finance does not support staking for the COMP token. One of the few ways to utilize the token is by supplying COMP to protocols such as Compound (roughly .90% APY the last 60 days) or CREAM (2.09% APY as of time of writing).\n\nIf we incentivize the COMP-BNT pool on Bancor protocol then this should be the most attractive option for COMP holders.\n\n**Tokenomics & Token Metrics**\n\nIn addition to being a standard ERC-20 asset, COMP allows the owner to *delegate* voting rights to the address of their choice; the owner’s wallet, another user, an application, or a DeFi expert. Anybody can participate in Compound governance by receiving delegation, without needing to own COMP. The token also includes code to query an address’ *historical voting weight* , which is useful for building complex voting systems.\n\nAddresses delegated at least 100,000 COMP can create governance proposals; any address can lock 100 COMP to create an Autonomous Proposal, which becomes a governance proposal after being delegated 100,000 COMP.\n\nA total of 10 million COMP tokens were created and distributed as follows:\n\n* 4,229,949 Users of the protocol (over 4-year period)\n* 2,396,307 Shareholders of Compound Labs, Inc.\n* 2,226,037 Founders & team(4-year vesting)\n* 372,707 Future team members\n* 775,000 Allocated for the community to advance governance through other means\n\n**Community and Communication**\n\n*Twitter*\n158.4K Followers\nhttps://twitter.com/compoundfinance\n*Discord*\n19.9K Members\nhttps://compound.finance/discord\n*Newsletter*\nhttps://compound.substack.com/\n\nThe Compound community has a large user following that has shown significant growth these past few months. Bringing these users over and making them aware of the Bancor Platform should boost our usage base.\n\n![image|689x153](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/bancordao/original/2X/0/0bd84920ef2a8deae9c4c5f5f8a88d98c52b76e9.png)\n \n**Available Audits**\n\n* [OpenZeppelin Security: Compound Alpha Governance System Audit](https://blog.openzeppelin.com/compound-alpha-governance-system-audit/)  (February 2020)\n\n* [Trail of Bits: Compound Governance Security Assessment](https://github.com/trailofbits/publications/blob/master/reviews/compound-governance.pdf) (February 2020)\n\n* [Trail of Bits: Compound Protocol Security Assessment](https://github.com/trailofbits/publications/blob/master/reviews/compound-3.pdf) (August 2019)\n\n**Market Data**\n\nThe market cap for COMP is roughly $2.2B with a $313M trading volume the past 24 hours.\n\n![image|379x500](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/bancordao/original/2X/9/9dc546aa5275edb81905c789b40ab58daa7b0b01.png)\n \nSince the beginning of the year it has done roughly  $197.9M daily volume on average (see: [historical stats](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/compound/historical_data/usd#panel)) on Exchanges. The majority of COMP currently resides on CEXes (Huobi, OKex, FTX, Binance) followed by DEXes with Sushiswap and Uniswap leading the pack.\n\n![image|189x500](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/bancordao/optimized/2X/a/aef0452005b33c5ef0f7fd53d0543e78fc6617b9_2_189x500.png)\n \nOn DEXes the largest trading pairs are COMP-ETH with Sushiswap and Uniswap having the deepest pools: \n\n![image|648x267](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/bancordao/original/2X/6/67ea6afa8165c53dbe899a49080fb41707f2cc5a.png)\n\nThere is an COMP-ETH pool on Uniswap V3 as well:\n![image|335x500](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/bancordao/original/2X/d/d4036c141f9607c5fc96159b955fe2ebae1d2feb.png)\n\nWith LM incentives from our end, I think that we could easily become the second deepest pool for the COMP token and surpass Uniswap V2/V3. Note that Sushiswap rewards the COMP-ETH pool with sushi and has a yearly ROI of 7.58% at the moment.\n\nVolume wise, the daily average for the last 30 days that the top two pools have done is roughly ~3.76M combined:\n\n![image|573x309](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/bancordao/original/2X/e/e42c26cb4ef603cefac1c09f744ee3067bec2347.png)\n \nIn the DeFi space the Compound protocol is consistently ranked in the top 10 by TVL in its platform:\n\n![image|690x325](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/bancordao/optimized/2X/3/388db089b65573749f2a546166550141d9e274f7_2_690x325.png)\n \nCompound finance is a well established protocol in the DeFi space and has been around since 2019. Since the launch of the COMP token last year, they kicked off DeFi summer and multiple projects followed suit by launching their own governance tokens. Compound has segmented themselves as one of the leading protocols in the lending space and has a large user base.\n\nIntroducing this community to Bancor should be beneficial to us and we have a chance to capture new users that will be introduced to single sided staking with impermanent loss protection. There is a potential for some of these folks to become long term LPs and even BNT token holders in the future. Future synergies between both communities can be built as BNT could be considered a collateral type that might be onboard to the Compound Protocol.\n",

      "content": "# TL;DR\n* Proposal to activate liquidity mining on QNT\n* Proposal to increase coinvestment on the QNT pool to 350,000 BNT\n* There is little DEX competition, but much volume potential\n* There is a lot of QNT liquidity on the sidelines\n\n# Justification\nThe community behind Quant Network is growing fast and it is gaining momentum. For QNT holders, currently there are almost no ways to gain interest on their QNT tokens. It can’t be used yet as collateral on platforms such as Aave or Compound, and Uniswap is the only competitor with a noteworthy QNT pool. Bancor can gain first mover advantage with their IL protection. There are no QNT pools yet on Balancer and Sushiswap.\n\nRecently QNT had its first tier 1 exchange listing, on Coinbase. This resulted in major momentum and awareness.\n\nThe QNT/BNT pool is already whitelisted for months, but the liquidity and volume is low due to the limited space. As a result, all DEX volume goes to Uniswaps QNT pool, also via DEX aggregators. \n\nTo summarize, we can:\n\n* Increase the TVL before Bancor’s v3 release\n* Steal market share from Uniswap (7-day QNT Trading Volume on Uniswap: $16.38m)\n* Bootstrap the competitiveness of Bancor’s QNT pool with temporary LM rewards\n\n# What is Quant Network’s Overledger OS?\n\nThe world’s first true universal DLT Interoperability tool oriented for enterprise. Designed to seamlessly interconnect private and public systems, networks and DLTs, Overledger is easy to implement, and eliminates the complexity of multi-DLT challenges at an enterprise level. Leading the way in distributed ledger connectivity, Overledger is the first DLT gateway that delivers interoperability across different systems, networks, and DLTs. Utilising REST APIs and a simple, portable interface, to connect users to the worlds DLTs for faster, more efficient expansion.\n\n![Overledger Network|690x278](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/bancordao/optimized/2X/3/3f0289fd0ebfd403519e3ad935c6885be1a2eacd_2_690x278.jpeg)",

      "content": "**This proposal is voting again, because previous one hasn't reach quorum.**\n\n#### Contract Address: [0x0f71b8de197a1c84d31de0f1fa7926c365f052b3]\nArcona has [passed audit of HashEx] in 2018. No one crytical issues was found, onather ones was fixed.\nProject website: **https://www.arcona.space/**\n\n## TLDR;\n- Whitelist Arcona XR Metaverse (ARCONA)\n- 5K BNT Co-Investment\n\n## Discussion\n**The Arcona® XR Metaverse** merges real and virtual worlds together creating blockchain powered layer of augmented reality all over the planet’s surface. Arcona is the digital ecosystem, marketplace connecting consumers with producers of content and services, making it easy for them to do business in cyberspace.\nArcona is disrupting the global AR market with a solution that reduces interactive projects costs from $30,000 to $ 300 and reduces the time from 3 months to 3 days. We bring simple tools to the mass market that solves the biggest problem - scalability for augmented reality technology.\n\n# Our experience\nThe creators of the **Arcona XR Metaverse** are [Piligrim XXI]. It started work in 2013 and immediately entered the international market for AR projects for the tourism industry. In Europe and Russia, we have deployed a whole network of [AR parks - large-scale interactive reconstructions of lost architectural monuments and historical events]. Our projects still have no analogues in the world in terms of scale and quality of the content.\nThe startup initially devoted a lot of effort to developing its own technology for remote positioning and 3D content management. The team brought together top-notch developers who completely closed the **technology stack, including blockchain, computer vision, artificial intelligence, neural networks, and GIS in tandem with SLAM technology**.\nIn 2017, the idea of the Arcona blockchain metaverse was born, a year later a crowdsale took place and in 2020 the platform was launched with full functionality. Published mobile application [Arcona Metaverse] is the main browser of the system for demonstrating AR projects. Arcona's digital lands have covered the entire planet. **It has sold more than 1.2 million m2** of digitized land in 20 major cities around the world. Income - over $ 500,000. Now Digital lands have entered the secondary market and can be purchased on NFT's largest selling portal, **[OpenSea]**. Arcona's AR content is hosted in over 1000 cities around the world. **More than 15,000 users** are registered in the system.\nToday Arcona is the only augmented reality metauniverse in which you can place NFT assets from different virtual worlds in the real world. You can use your NFT content right now and deploy it to your lands independently of the Arcona team. This clearly shows how NFT assets provide interoperability between the blockchain ecosystem and cyberspace.\n\n## Tokenomics\nThe main feature of **Arcona XR Metaverse is universal information AR layer – the Digital Land**, where users can independently and remotely (from the workplace) place interactive content anywhere in the world. Ready-to-use network of terrain-related markers on the entire surface of the planet. Open modular architecture allowing to integrate third-party solutions. **You can buy, sell, rent or lease the Digital Land in exchange for the ARCONA token.**\nThe ARCONA token is the equivalent of the all digital assets value of the [Arcona Metaverse]. Using the ARCONA, you can sell creative software or 3D content to landowners and users: **buy Games, Attend Special venues within the Arcona Ecosystem, Buy Professional services within the Arcona Ecosystem (coding, advertising, content creation, etc.) and Participate in ads, promotions, special events, games, etc.**\n\n## **ARCONA** – 100% Utility token.\nThe crowdsale of the project ended in July 2018 and [total supply was 15,181,707,01308544976911725\nARCONA].\n##### Tokens were distributed as follows:\n- team - 20% (Vesting: 5% for 6 months, 5% for 12 months\nand 10% for 18 months after the ICO is finalized)\n- advisors - 7%\n- bounty - 2%\n- reserve Fund - 11%\n- for Sale - 60%\n\nCurrently, all ARCONA tokens have been purchased by the community and are in circulation. A fairly even distribution of tokens among holders protects the market value of the token from manipulation by large players, which ensures stability and complete decentralization of the project.\nOther the Ecosystem Assets such as Digital land, content or scripts are nonfungible token ERC 721 standards. Property rights to those assets as well as the conditions and the cost or royalty of their use are recorded in the smart contract.\nSo, each piece of [Arcona Digital Land is an ARDL land token, ERC-721 standard]. Its smart contract contains all the main characteristics, including the identification number, geographical coordinates, information about the current and previous owners.\n#### Smart contract: [0xdf5d68d54433661b1e5e90a547237ffb0adf6ec2]\nIn June 2021, at the request of our community, the team launched ARCONA on two blockchain networks - [Binance Smart Chain] and [Minter]. **At the same time, the total volume of tokens simultaneously in circulation on all blockchains does not exceed 15M ARCONA**. Now our users have more freedom to use Arcona digital assets on a variety of sites, and the project has become more resilient to external influences. In the near future, Arcona will be deployed on several more blockchains.\n\n## Token Security\n\n1. The token contract is not upgradable.\n2. Only the token holders themselves can burn their tokens.\n3. Minting of new tokens is restricted and conform of the [security audit].\n4. Token with hard total supply.\n5. Token not apply transfer fees.\n6. Token transfers is't pausable.\n7. Contract already working 3 years after ICO.\n\n## Economic Requirements\n\nThe token is fairly distributed, you can check etherscan contract address: [0x0f71b8de197a1c84d31de0f1fa7926c365f052b3].\n\n## Community\nThe ecosystem has a major social significance. For AR project creators, it offers extremely simple tools to translate their ideas. For developers, it is a convenient platform for testing new solutions and bringing them to the market. For businessmen, this is a good way to make money on AR or promote their projects using AR technology. And numerous Arcona users, thanks to the universal platform viewer, compatible with most mobile devices, will be able to see and evaluate the latest ideas in the field of augmented reality. Such capabilities will help advance AR technologies and make the platform an industry standard. **We value our community very much and strive to create truly immersive living and business environments for everyone in the AR metaverse**. On the Arcona Marketplace, producers and consumers can exchange resources and pay for them using the platform's internal tokens. The portal can be primarily used to sell content, software and Digital Land. Arcona makes extracting real-world value from skills developed in the virtual gaming space possible. This will give millions of people an opportunity to make a living in a world more populated than any other virtual universe.\nFor our token holders, we are constantly running a variety of promotions that not only support the liquidity of ARCONA, but also bring many pleasant surprises to the participants. These are liquidity pools on different blockchains, farming programs with prize NFTs, draws of Digital Land plots and exciting quests with treasure hunt in the AR space.\n\n## Benefit to Bancor\n**The Bancor White List could be another exciting opportunity for our community** and an additional liquidity guarantee for the ARCONA token. We'd love to hear your feedback on the [Arcona Metaverse]. **Therefore, among all those who voted, we will play out our [Feod NFT domain]**. These will be beautiful 3D ARCONA coins, which will allow you to receive a digital land plot as a gift anywhere on the planet of your choice. And like any NFT in our system, you can immediately place a prize coin on your lot. **We will give away 10 [Feod NFT domain]'s** among all voting participants, **regardless of which way they vote**.\n\n## Communication\n**The Arcona team is highly engaged with its community** through a plethora of channels. We is mainly active on [Discord] and [Telegram], but we do have [Twitter], The best place to closely follow the project and read all about it is [Arcona blog]\n\n[passed audit of HashEx]: <https://marketplace.arcona.io/storage/app/media/docs/Arcona%20audit%20rus.pdf>\n[OpenSea]: <https://opensea.io/assets/arcona-digital-land>\n[Piligrim XXI]: <https://www.piligrimxxi.com/>\n[AR parks - large-scale interactive reconstructions of lost architectural monuments and historical events]: <https://fasie.ru/press/fund/piligrim-xxi-sozdal-ar-prilozhenie-dlya-vossozdaniya-utrachennykh/>\n[Arcona Metaverse]: <https://apps.apple.com/us/app/arcona-augmented-reality-world/id1483217647>\n[total supply was 15,181,707,01308544976911725\nARCONA]: <https://etherscan.io/token/0x0f71b8de197a1c84d31de0f1fa7926c365f052b3>\n[Arcona Digital Land is an ARDL land token, ERC-721 standard]: <https://etherscan.io/token/0xdf5d68d54433661b1e5e90a547237ffb0adf6ec2>\n[0x0f71b8de197a1c84d31de0f1fa7926c365f052b3]: <https://etherscan.io/token/0x0f71b8de197a1c84d31de0f1fa7926c365f052b3>\n[0xdf5d68d54433661b1e5e90a547237ffb0adf6ec2]: <https://etherscan.io/token/0xdf5d68d54433661b1e5e90a547237ffb0adf6ec2>\n[Arcona blog]: <https://www.arcona.space/blog>\n[Discord]: <https://discord.gg/rqXEwAx>\n[Telegram]: <https://t.me/arcona_digital_land>\n[Twitter]: <https://twitter.com/arconametaverse>\n[Feod NFT domain]: <https://opensea.io/assets/0x495f947276749ce646f68ac8c248420045cb7b5e/99303134810194776115737565454567211236303886079612500656884637393524948468712>\n[Binance Smart Chain]: <https://bscscan.com/token/0x8fc4532be3003fb5a3a2f9afc7e95b3bfbd5faab>\n[Minter]: <https://chainik.io/token/ARCONA>\n[security audit]: <https://marketplace.arcona.io/storage/app/media/docs/Arcona%20audit%20rus.pdf>",

      "content": "#### Contract Address: [0x0f71b8de197a1c84d31de0f1fa7926c365f052b3]\nArcona has [passed audit of HashEx] in 2018. No one crytical issues was found, onather ones was fixed.\nProject website: **https://www.arcona.space/**\n\n## TLDR;\n- Whitelist Arcona XR Metaverse (ARCONA)\n- 5K BNT Co-Investment\n\n## Discussion\n**The Arcona® XR Metaverse** merges real and virtual worlds together creating blockchain powered layer of augmented reality all over the planet’s surface. Arcona is the digital ecosystem, marketplace connecting consumers with producers of content and services, making it easy for them to do business in cyberspace.\nArcona is disrupting the global AR market with a solution that reduces interactive projects costs from $30,000 to $ 300 and reduces the time from 3 months to 3 days. We bring simple tools to the mass market that solves the biggest problem - scalability for augmented reality technology.\n\n# Our experience\nThe creators of the **Arcona XR Metaverse** are [Piligrim XXI]. It started work in 2013 and immediately entered the international market for AR projects for the tourism industry. In Europe and Russia, we have deployed a whole network of [AR parks - large-scale interactive reconstructions of lost architectural monuments and historical events]. Our projects still have no analogues in the world in terms of scale and quality of the content.\nThe startup initially devoted a lot of effort to developing its own technology for remote positioning and 3D content management. The team brought together top-notch developers who completely closed the **technology stack, including blockchain, computer vision, artificial intelligence, neural networks, and GIS in tandem with SLAM technology**.\nIn 2017, the idea of the Arcona blockchain metaverse was born, a year later a crowdsale took place and in 2020 the platform was launched with full functionality. Published mobile application [Arcona Metaverse] is the main browser of the system for demonstrating AR projects. Arcona's digital lands have covered the entire planet. **It has sold more than 1.2 million m2** of digitized land in 20 major cities around the world. Income - over $ 500,000. Now Digital lands have entered the secondary market and can be purchased on NFT's largest selling portal, **[OpenSea]**. Arcona's AR content is hosted in over 1000 cities around the world. **More than 15,000 users** are registered in the system.\nToday Arcona is the only augmented reality metauniverse in which you can place NFT assets from different virtual worlds in the real world. You can use your NFT content right now and deploy it to your lands independently of the Arcona team. This clearly shows how NFT assets provide interoperability between the blockchain ecosystem and cyberspace.\n\n## Tokenomics\nThe main feature of **Arcona XR Metaverse is universal information AR layer – the Digital Land**, where users can independently and remotely (from the workplace) place interactive content anywhere in the world. Ready-to-use network of terrain-related markers on the entire surface of the planet. Open modular architecture allowing to integrate third-party solutions. **You can buy, sell, rent or lease the Digital Land in exchange for the ARCONA token.**\nThe ARCONA token is the equivalent of the all digital assets value of the [Arcona Metaverse]. Using the ARCONA, you can sell creative software or 3D content to landowners and users: **buy Games, Attend Special venues within the Arcona Ecosystem, Buy Professional services within the Arcona Ecosystem (coding, advertising, content creation, etc.) and Participate in ads, promotions, special events, games, etc.**\n\n## **ARCONA** – 100% Utility token.\nThe crowdsale of the project ended in July 2018 and [total supply was 15,181,707,01308544976911725\nARCONA].\n##### Tokens were distributed as follows:\n- team - 20% (Vesting: 5% for 6 months, 5% for 12 months\nand 10% for 18 months after the ICO is finalized)\n- advisors - 7%\n- bounty - 2%\n- reserve Fund - 11%\n- for Sale - 60%\n\nCurrently, all ARCONA tokens have been purchased by the community and are in circulation. A fairly even distribution of tokens among holders protects the market value of the token from manipulation by large players, which ensures stability and complete decentralization of the project.\nOther the Ecosystem Assets such as Digital land, content or scripts are nonfungible token ERC 721 standards. Property rights to those assets as well as the conditions and the cost or royalty of their use are recorded in the smart contract.\nSo, each piece of [Arcona Digital Land is an ARDL land token, ERC-721 standard]. Its smart contract contains all the main characteristics, including the identification number, geographical coordinates, information about the current and previous owners.\n#### Smart contract: [0xdf5d68d54433661b1e5e90a547237ffb0adf6ec2]\nIn June 2021, at the request of our community, the team launched ARCONA on two blockchain networks - [Binance Smart Chain] and [Minter]. **At the same time, the total volume of tokens simultaneously in circulation on all blockchains does not exceed 15M ARCONA**. Now our users have more freedom to use Arcona digital assets on a variety of sites, and the project has become more resilient to external influences. In the near future, Arcona will be deployed on several more blockchains.\n\n## Token Security\n\n1. The token contract is not upgradable.\n2. Only the token holders themselves can burn their tokens.\n3. Minting of new tokens is restricted and conform of the [security audit].\n4. Token with hard total supply.\n5. Token not apply transfer fees.\n6. Token transfers is't pausable.\n7. Contract already working 3 years after ICO.\n\n## Economic Requirements\n\nThe token is fairly distributed, you can check etherscan contract address: [0x0f71b8de197a1c84d31de0f1fa7926c365f052b3].\n\n## Community\nThe ecosystem has a major social significance. For AR project creators, it offers extremely simple tools to translate their ideas. For developers, it is a convenient platform for testing new solutions and bringing them to the market. For businessmen, this is a good way to make money on AR or promote their projects using AR technology. And numerous Arcona users, thanks to the universal platform viewer, compatible with most mobile devices, will be able to see and evaluate the latest ideas in the field of augmented reality. Such capabilities will help advance AR technologies and make the platform an industry standard. **We value our community very much and strive to create truly immersive living and business environments for everyone in the AR metaverse**. On the Arcona Marketplace, producers and consumers can exchange resources and pay for them using the platform's internal tokens. The portal can be primarily used to sell content, software and Digital Land. Arcona makes extracting real-world value from skills developed in the virtual gaming space possible. This will give millions of people an opportunity to make a living in a world more populated than any other virtual universe.\nFor our token holders, we are constantly running a variety of promotions that not only support the liquidity of ARCONA, but also bring many pleasant surprises to the participants. These are liquidity pools on different blockchains, farming programs with prize NFTs, draws of Digital Land plots and exciting quests with treasure hunt in the AR space.\n\n## Benefit to Bancor\n**The Bancor White List could be another exciting opportunity for our community** and an additional liquidity guarantee for the ARCONA token. We'd love to hear your feedback on the [Arcona Metaverse]. **Therefore, among all those who voted, we will play out our [Feod NFT domain]**. These will be beautiful 3D ARCONA coins, which will allow you to receive a digital land plot as a gift anywhere on the planet of your choice. And like any NFT in our system, you can immediately place a prize coin on your lot. **We will give away 10 [Feod NFT domain]'s** among all voting participants, **regardless of which way they vote**.\n\n## Communication\n**The Arcona team is highly engaged with its community** through a plethora of channels. We is mainly active on [Discord] and [Telegram], but we do have [Twitter], The best place to closely follow the project and read all about it is [Arcona blog]\n\n[passed audit of HashEx]: <https://marketplace.arcona.io/storage/app/media/docs/Arcona%20audit%20rus.pdf>\n[OpenSea]: <https://opensea.io/assets/arcona-digital-land>\n[Piligrim XXI]: <https://www.piligrimxxi.com/>\n[AR parks - large-scale interactive reconstructions of lost architectural monuments and historical events]: <https://fasie.ru/press/fund/piligrim-xxi-sozdal-ar-prilozhenie-dlya-vossozdaniya-utrachennykh/>\n[Arcona Metaverse]: <https://apps.apple.com/us/app/arcona-augmented-reality-world/id1483217647>\n[total supply was 15,181,707,01308544976911725\nARCONA]: <https://etherscan.io/token/0x0f71b8de197a1c84d31de0f1fa7926c365f052b3>\n[Arcona Digital Land is an ARDL land token, ERC-721 standard]: <https://etherscan.io/token/0xdf5d68d54433661b1e5e90a547237ffb0adf6ec2>\n[0x0f71b8de197a1c84d31de0f1fa7926c365f052b3]: <https://etherscan.io/token/0x0f71b8de197a1c84d31de0f1fa7926c365f052b3>\n[0xdf5d68d54433661b1e5e90a547237ffb0adf6ec2]: <https://etherscan.io/token/0xdf5d68d54433661b1e5e90a547237ffb0adf6ec2>\n[Arcona blog]: <https://www.arcona.space/blog>\n[Discord]: <https://discord.gg/rqXEwAx>\n[Telegram]: <https://t.me/arcona_digital_land>\n[Twitter]: <https://twitter.com/arconametaverse>\n[Feod NFT domain]: <https://opensea.io/assets/0x495f947276749ce646f68ac8c248420045cb7b5e/99303134810194776115737565454567211236303886079612500656884637393524948468712>\n[Binance Smart Chain]: <https://bscscan.com/token/0x8fc4532be3003fb5a3a2f9afc7e95b3bfbd5faab>\n[Minter]: <https://chainik.io/token/ARCONA>\n[security audit]: <https://marketplace.arcona.io/storage/app/media/docs/Arcona%20audit%20rus.pdf>",

The mechanism for this is staking the tokenized balances (idleUSDC, idleDAI, etc.), meaning users can still exit at any time, they just stop earning IDLE at the increased levels (The long term distribution program won't start right at governance launch, but 20% of the total supply have already been reserved and sent to the LongLPFund[ 0x107A369bc066c77FF061c7d2420618a6ce31B925](http://etherscan.io/address/0x107A369bc066c77FF061c7d2420618a6ce31B925) which is managed by the governance)\n\n### Top 10 Token holders\n\nSource: https://etherscan.io/token/tokenholderchart/0x875773784Af8135eA0ef43b5a374AaD105c5D39e?range=10\n\n* Governance Fund: 0x107a369bc066c77ff061c7d2420618a6ce31b925\n\n2,600,000 IDLE, 20.00% of Total Supply\n\n* Governance Fund: 0xb0aa1f98523ec15932dd5faac5d86e57115571c7\n\n1,718,828.91 IDLE, 13.22% of Total Supply\n\n* Team Funds: 0x06a44ce4a37dba5a90267db93c144522d5c178f6\n\n1,366,196 IDLE, 10.50% of Total Supply\n\n* Idle Contracts: 0x275da8e61ea8e02d51edd8d0dc5c0e62b4cdb0be\n\n973,350.22 IDLE, 7.48% of Total Supply\n\n* Investor Funds: 0x57d2a95bea18ad894c35ce2ca89c5928f9b2f912\n\n947,700 IDLE, 7.29% of Total Supply\n\n* Team Funds: 0x9e5a7eeb2eb6bbb735c75075114090015040909f\n\n919,555 IDLE, 7.07% of Total Supply\n\n* Liquidity Mining Fund: 0x031f71b5369c251a6544c41ce059e6b3d61e42c6\n\n787,602 IDLE, 6.05% of Total Supply\n\n* Investor Funds: 0x53967e3ffdab0a0f2bce097383c34ec0a3f0b0fe\n\n403,985 IDLE, 3.10% of Total Supply\n\n* Team Funds: 0xf1bd4d3f7e0172b9dafcff91decd9f077ed01887\n\n341,549 IDLE, 2.62% of Total Supply\n\n* Team Funds: 0x2e56c44e571a8f926e2cd8cb247a7074559c64dc\n\n325,000 IDLE, 2.50% of Total Supply\n\nMore info about Idle token distribution and addresses are available here: https://developers.idle.finance/governance/distribution\n\n# Tokenomics\n\n![|602x355](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/bancordao/optimized/2X/c/cbc099b44106db64bad4c742d0cc41cfcd033f9e_2_602x355.png)\n\nThe above $IDLE emission schedule does not take account of Ecosystem Fund and LongTerm LPs Program, which will be deployed via community vote).\n\n* Maximum supply: 13,000,0000\n* Circulating supply: 1,742,607\n\n**FAQs**\n\n* Q: Is there a rebase/elastic supply mechanism?\n* A: No, there is no rebase/elastic supply mechanism within the protocol.\n<br>\n\n* Q: Is the token contract upgradable?\n* A: No, the $IDLE token is not upgradable.\n<br>\n\n* Q: Do token holders burn IDLE tokens?

      "title": "Reduce the swap fee on ETH to 0.1%",
      "content": "# TL;DR\n* Following the DAO decision on May 20, 2021, the ETH swap fee was increased from 0.10% to 0.15%.\n* We have now collected over a month of data, but which has proven difficult to analyze due to the high level of noise in market activity over this period.\n* Herein it is proposed that the fee be reduced back to 0.1%, while we work with data scientists and community members to extract meaning from the existing dataset.\n* In the future, the process of increasing the fee, and reducing it again can be repeated to continue to test the conclusions of the developing theory.\n\n# The effect of pool fees is largely unknown. \nSince the launch of v2.1, the subject of pool fees has been a polarizing issue. There are compelling arguments to make for both reducing and increasing the fee and in both cases, the foundational theory for making these decisions is virtually non-existent. Members of the BancorDAO have attracted attention to this issue, and are beginning to propose experiments that would allow future decisions to be influenced by the data gathered during these changes. This is not a simple task. \n\nRunning these experiments is complicated by the fact that we only control one variable, and the significance of its effect on trade volumes has yet to be demonstrated. To separate the signal from the noise, data should be collected over substantive periods, and then returned to some baseline level. Repeating the process several times adds confidence to the conclusions of the analysis, and contributes to the developing theory. \n\nI submit that the time interval associated with the increased ETH pool fee has been long enough that a return to 0.10% is probably overdue. Resetting this variable, and continuing to collect data is part of the process; this proposal does *not* make any judgement as to whether 0.10% or 0.15% is preferable. We simply don't know yet, and moving the fee back to where it was after this testing period is complete is an implicit requirement of the investigation. The question is *when* should the fee be moved back? \n\n# A note on analysis.\nFor some community members, the difficulty of extracting meaning from the available data might be mysterious, while others with an earned erudition in data science will likely see the challenge as the beast it really is. Regardless of where on this spectrum you find yourself, I am ambitious that the value of repeated trials is probably well-understood. I am actively speaking with potential on- and off-chain data analysts to help with the interpretation of the results gathered during these fee experiments. After these efforts yield fruit, future changes to the ETH pool fee can be more hypothesis-driven, and likely be performed on smaller time intervals. \n\n# Voting Instructions\n**To DECREASE the pool fee on ETH from 0.15% to 0.10%, vote FOR**\n**To leave the pool fee on ETH UNCHANGED at 0.15%, vote AGAINST**",

The TRU token supply is fixed at 1,450,000,000, of which 239,842,417 are in current circulation. Some tokens have been burned so in fact the total supply is now 1,442,485,442.37835615.\n\nThe contracts and addresses with the highest concentration of TRU tokens are predominantly unallocated community incentives, the token vesting contracts, two of the team’s wallets, and Binance. You can find an overview of the top wallets [here ](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1EkF1WMGtW5ulicfkQhIMu4c-jIsZaZX9byZzeOwfjkc/edit#gid=324745146) and a detailed description of the token supply [here](https://blog.trusttoken.com/truefis-tru-token-economics-7facea6651c0).\n\n# Project\n\nTrueFi is an on-chain unsecured lending and credit protocol. Users are able to lend stablecoins (for now just TUSD, but shortly USDC and other tokens) to TrueFi and earn a 10%+ yield on their deposits. Borrowers are diligenced and approved by governance to be able to borrow without collateral requirements. TrueFi will also be launching an on-chain credit score that other protocols will be able to utilize in an effort to improve credit efficiency throughout DeFi.\n\n# Tokenonmics\n\nTrueFi’s token, TRU is used for both governance and staking on the platform. TRU stakers deposit TRU into the protocol’s staking contract and are credited with stkTRU (currently, about 30% of circulating supply is being staked) which can be used for governance and approving loans. In the case of a default, stakers stand to lose a portion of their staked TRU. Stakers are also entitled to all fees generated by the protocol.\n\n# Community and Communication\n\nTrueFi is active on [Twitter ](https://twitter.com/TrustToken), [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/3tMyMqyqDj), and [Telegram](https://t.me/jointruefi).\n\n# Available Audits\n\nAll audits can be found publicly on our [Github page](https://github.com/trusttoken/audits/tree/master/TrueFi).\n\n# Market and Trading Data\n\n* ATH was $0.615301 (Feb 13, 2021)\n* ATL was $0.108493 (Nov 26, 2020)\n* Max supply of 1,442,485,442.37835615\n* TRU is available on SushiSwap and Uniswap\n* [Coingecko](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/truefi)",

The [token contract](https://etherscan.io/address/0x7f39c581f595b53c5cb19bd0b3f8da6c935e2ca0#code) appears to be a standard OpenZeppelin contract. \n\nDue to the nature of Lido stETH the amount of your balance is not constant - it changes daily as staking rewards come in. This is what's known as a rebasable token. In the case of stETH, this is reflected through a daily token balance change to reflect your earned rewards. Wrapping stETH creates a DeFi-compatible version of the stETH token which allows for easier integrations with DeFi protocols such as Bancor.\n\nLido's wstETH is a wrapped token based on stETH. stETH is a token that represents staked ether in Lido, combining the value of initial deposit + staking rewards (from ETH2 blockchain). stETH tokens are minted upon deposit and burned when redeemed. stETH token balances are pegged 1:1 to the ethers that are staked by Lido. stETH token’s balances are updated when the oracle reports change in total stake every day.\n\nwstETH does not have a fixed supply and there is roughly 1950 stETH locked in the [smart contract](https://etherscan.io/address/0x7f39c581f595b53c5cb19bd0b3f8da6c935e2ca0). The highest concentration of wstETH is locked in ARCx to mint their stable coin. The rest appear to be regular ETH holders:\n\n![image|690x389](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/bancordao/optimized/2X/9/9d221438dbdea0fcb9bb24b750046eb200a6242e_2_690x389.png)\n\n# Project\n\nLido is a staking solution for ETH 2.0 backed by several industry-leading staking providers. It makes staked ETH liquid and allows participation with any amount of ETH.\n\nWhen using Lido to stake your ETH on the Ethereum beacon chain, users will receive a token (stETH), which represents their ETH on the Ethereum beacon chain on a 1:1 basis. It effectively acts as a bridge bringing ETH 2.0’s staking rewards to ETH 1.0.\n\nAs a user’s staked ETH generates staking rewards from ETH 2.0, the user’s ETH balance on the beacon chain will increase. stETH balances will update correspondingly once per day allowing you to access on ETH 1.0 the value of your staking rewards received on ETH 2.0.\n\nUsers can use stETH in all of the same ways that they can use ETH: sell it, spend it and, since it is compatible to be used in DeFi, use it as collateral for on-chain lending. When transactions are enabled on ETH 2.0, users can also redeem stETH for ETH.\n\n# Tokenomics\n\nUsers who stake their ETH into the Eth2 contract via Lido will receive the liquid token equivalent in the form of stETH. For the sake of simplicity, this means that if you stake 1 ETH with Lido, you receive 1stETH in return.\n\nstETH allows users to participate in the DeFi ecosystem whilst still accruing Eth2 rewards earned from staking during Phase 0.\n\nstETH accrues staking rewards regardless of where it is acquired. This means that regardless of whether you acquire stETH directly from staking via stake.lido.fi, purchase stETH from 1inch or receive it from a friend, it will rebase daily to reflect Ethereum staking rewards.\n\nThis nullifies the downsides from staking into the Eth2 contract directly: illiquidity, immovability, inaccessibility. Instead of locking up your staked ETH, Lido allows you to put it to use so you don’t need to choose between Ethereum staking and DeFi participation.\n\n![image|690x427](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/bancordao/optimized/2X/4/42cd9166d95b320789abbaeab61f8cff20d1e8fd_2_690x427.png)\n\nFor more information see:\n\nhttps://blog.lido.fi/steth-the-mechanics-of-steth/\n\n### Investors\n\nLido raised $2 million in a Dec. 2020 round backed by Semantic Ventures, ParaFi Capital, Terra, KR1, Stakefish, and Staking Facilities, among others. Angel investors, including Rune Christensen of MakerDAO, Stani Kulechov of Aave, and Kain Warwick of Synthetix, also participated in the round.\n\nLido also recently (May 2021) raised $73 million in a [round](https://www.theblockcrypto.com/linked/103874/eth2-staking-protocol-lido-raises-73-million-paradigm) led by paradigm capital.\n\n# Community and Communication\n\nThe Lido team operates an official [Twitter](https://twitter.com/lidofinance), [Blog](https://blog.lido.fi/), and [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/LidoFinance/) account.

There is a Max Supply of 1 Billion Tokens with 560 Million currently in circulation. It’s supply is pretty well spread out with a presence in multiple centralized and decentralized exchanges.\n\n![Screen Shot 2021-06-24 at 5.11.11 PM|690x288](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/bancordao/optimized/2X/2/237155127ddd55406375f5c16b130a073db00b76_2_690x288.png)\n\n[quote=\"tenzent, post:1, topic:2476\"]\nThe only particular risk seems to be the Owner Privilidges one but the NEXO Team is fully doxxed and heavily compliant with regulations and regular financial audits : [Licenses & Registrations • Nexo](https://nexo.io/licenses-and-registrations)\n[/quote]\n\n\n\n# **Project**\n\nThe NEXO Token is a Utility Token that allows for Borrowing, Staking, Governance, and Boosting APRs on Stable and Crypto Pairs with more features to launch in the future. The Platforms Primary market is lending however, in which it's a leader in the centralized space.\n\n![Screen Shot 2021-06-24 at 5.09.51 PM|690x296](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/bancordao/optimized/2X/3/3202a543c96aede150f0951e243cf7d83fd000b6_2_690x296.jpeg)\n\n\"Nexo delivers the World’s First Instant Crypto-backed Loans, thus resolving a crucial inefficiency for the crypto world. Up to this very moment, no alternatives existed for digital asset owners to enjoy their crypto wealth except selling them. The innovative model of Nexo brings to the crypto community the best of both worlds - retaining 100% ownership of their digital assets while having immediate access to cash. The Instant Cryptobacked Loans are an automatic, flexible and cost-efficient way of obtaining liquidity that is secured by the value of the client’s digital assets. The whole process is completed in just a few simple clicks. No hidden fees, no capital gains taxes, no credit checks. Transparency is guaranteed through the use of blockchain technology, smart contracts and algorithmic processes executed by the Nexo blockchain oracle.\"\n\n# **Co-Investment Reasoning**\n\nNEXO is a top 100 Token and garners consistent volume with relatively low levels of liquidity on DEXs. A 250K Co-Investment will allow Bancor to become the #1 Pool and earn high yields. In the 24HR rate in the picture below it would appear that the Liquidity to Volume Ratio is 2:1 but looking at past data it’s usually more of a 1:1 with some outliers that are remarkably higher than that even.\n\n![Screen Shot 2021-06-24 at 4.49.46 PM|690x289](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/bancordao/optimized/2X/0/027addf52a2ede85602eaec2a778ce3920583a64_2_690x289.jpeg)\n![Screen Shot 2021-06-24 at 4.51.11 PM|690x321](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/bancordao/optimized/2X/f/fe70267685accb759f31cef2fbf75d78bd19edfd_2_690x321.jpeg)\n\n\n**NEXO Price and Market Stats**\n\n|**NEXO Price**|$1.58|\n| --- | --- |\n|**NEXO ROI**|1467.2%|\n|**Market Cap**|$878,202,041|\n|**Market Cap Dominance**|0.06%|\n|**Trading Volume**|$5,732,022|\n|**Volume / Market Cap**|0.0065|\n|**24h Low / 24h High**|$1.41 / $1.59|\n|**7d Low / 7d High**|$1.32 / $1.87|\n|**Market Cap Rank**|#81|\n\n# **Community and Communication**\n\n[Reddit](https://reddit.com/r/Nexo) - [Twitter](https://twitter.com/NexoFinance) - [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/600422830081646) - [Telegram](https://t.me/nexofinance) - [Github](https://github.com/nexofinance)\n\n# **Available Audits**\n\nIndépendant Audit by Callisto : https://callisto.network/nexo-token-nexo-security-audit/\n\nThe only particular risk seems to be the Owner Privilidges one but the NEXO Team is fully doxxed and heavily compliant with regulations and regular financial audits : https://nexo.io/licenses-and-registrations",

More ROOK holders can learn about Bancor\n2. Deeper liquidity can increase trade share\n3. Higher trade share = more fees.\n\n![](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/bancordao/optimized/2X/2/2ea209db41bb3aab0867005d0843216f53c4339a_2_690x418.png)\n\n![](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/bancordao/original/2X/e/e314f73a1d6418d9551e441bbacafc984695ad10.png)\n\n![](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/bancordao/original/2X/b/bf3b33fdc8383264e1397ac2dde5b9ddbaaedf7c.png)\n\nThe co-investment here would put us at 1.3M BNT since there is already a 1M minting limit on this pool. Given that there is 1.22M in BNT at the moment on this pool, does this mean that this would only open up roughly ~80K in BNT value on the TKN side?\n\nIt looks like at its peak this pool held roughly ~40K rook and we are down to ~30K at the moment:\n\n![](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/bancordao/optimized/2X/7/7a0bc02a0e099e380a36ade76f6a84548fa185b3_2_690x257.png)\n\nThis probably coincides with the LM ending on this pool.\n\nIt is good to note that the owner of this pool recently (~28 days ago) raised the fees from .2% to .5% on this pool as well:\n\n![](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/bancordao/optimized/2X/9/9c2053b7fe265dec81a57f7dceb7c2ae9cb33e6d_2_690x258.png)\n\n![](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/bancordao/optimized/2X/9/9c2053b7fe265dec81a57f7dceb7c2ae9cb33e6d_2_690x258.png)\n\n![](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/bancordao/optimized/2X/7/7d8e9f6c2b79358ceb59713662951ea69b73e7f4_2_690x257.png)\n\nSeems like it might have stunted the volume on this pool? We are only coming into the picture when the size of the trades are ~$18K - ~$19K and only getting 20% of ETH-ROOK trades routed to us:\n\n![](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/bancordao/optimized/2X/3/312fa83626b4634792edb36e6a866c744e1dc65d_2_690x168.jpeg)\n\nWe are at 50% when trade sizes are greater than ~$420K\n\n![](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/bancordao/optimized/2X/4/40073800c9b5f16fded96ef9d74ec9b96160d7b8_2_690x218.jpeg)\n\nand don’t get any larger portions send our way. You hit a 10% price impact at > $750K trade sizes and even at those levels we are still at 50%. This makes sense given that the uniswap + sushiswap combined liquidity is ~7M or roughly equal to us. With that said, we should be capturing 50% of trades at the lower levels which we are not at the moment.\n\n",

      "content": "# Proposal: Whitelist THORChain (ERC-20 RUNE)\n\n![RUNE x BNT|690x494](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/bancordao/original/2X/0/0b3d5ea504ea4cb4e7610acc54a77ff09a77666e.jpeg)\n\n**This proposal is expected to appear on Snapshot for voting on June 28, 2021 12:00 PM .**\n\n# TLDR;\n\n* Whitelist RUNE (ERC-20)\n* Great Liquidity to Volume Ratios.\n* 600,000 BNT Co-Invest in order to beat out the Sushi pool.\n* ThorChain has passed multiple Audits and has proven to be a great force/addition in the decentralized space. Their community is incredible and Thorchain has spoken of Bancor in the past.\n\nProject Site : Thorchain.org\n\nContract Address: 0x3155ba85d5f96b2d030a4966af206230e46849cb\n\n# Token Security\n\nRUNE (ERC-20) Is the ERC-20 Version of the native RUNE token on ThorChain, It does not have a rebase mechanism or elastic supply. THORChain has passed many high quality audits, and though it’s team is anonymous they have proven to be one of the best anonymous teams out there by garnering a massive community behind them to assist with liquidity provision, marketing, engineering, maintenance, support, and community management.\n\n![RUNE Top Holders (erc-20)png|690x281](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/bancordao/optimized/2X/8/84b1befcc44b2c446f0fafe87382ca1c2a80c629_2_690x281.jpeg)\n\n# Project\n\nTHORChain is a decentralised network focused on bringing liquidity to cross-chain assets. It does this using a simple Uniswap-like automated market maker (AMM) design. Some have called it “Uniswap for the multichain world”. THORChain has been live with mainnet assets since September 2020. The project is built on tried-and-tested technical and economic primitives, including Tendermint BFT, Cosmos SDK, Gennaro and Goldfeder’s Threshold Signature Scheme (TSS) and a variant on Uniswap’s constant function market making formula.\n\n(ᚱ) RUNE Powers & Secures the Network.\n\n1. Liquidity. As a settlement asset.\n2. Security. As a sybil-resistant mechanism and means for driving economic behavior.\n3. Governance. To signal priority on-chain.\n4. Incentives. To payout rewards, charge fees and subsidise gas.\n5. Amplifier. to elevate assets\n\nTo read more thoroughly how everything works: https://thorchain.org/rune#what-does-it-do\n\n# Co-Investment Reasoning\n\nCurrently, there are two major Pools in Uniswap and Sushiswap, both garnering a good amount of volume. A 600,000 Co-Investment makes the most sense in order to have greater depth than Sushi so we can pick up a greater amount of aggregator trades (600BNT = ~1.8M USD of Liquidity). It is within reason that the THORChain Team and or Community will pick this up since they have a good knowledge of what bancor is and does and have talked about it in their socials before. They are particularly fond of Bancor’s ability to insure Impermanent Loss. We are open to changing the Co-Investment as well if there are other Ideas as to a number.\n\n![RUNE Uniswap data|512x161](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/bancordao/original/2X/4/4f6497ee1a3cbe0ecf55b5950cec07a5374b9e38.png)\n![RUNE Sushiswap data|512x229](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/bancordao/original/2X/d/d69aa4ccaff3d7171e17b9ab5fbc1dcbb0eef1e9.png)\n\n\n*The day the picture was taken the Volume was quite low so I highlighted some levels to show the proportions on the candles above.\n\n## THORChain Details\n\n|RUNE Price|$6.29|\n| --- | --- |\n|Market Cap|$102,371,734|\n|Market Cap Dominance|0.01%|\n|Trading Volume|$645,471|\n|Volume / Market Cap|0.0063|\n|24h Low / 24h High|$5.82 / $6.49|\n|7d Low / 7d High|$5.28 / $6.40|\n|Market Cap Rank|#260|\n|All-Time High|$20.76 -69.6%|\n|All-Time Low|$1.55 308.2%|\n\n# Community and Communication\n\nReddit : https://www.reddit.com/r/thorchain\n\nTwitter : https://twitter.com/thorchain_org\n\nTelegram : https://t.me/thorchain_org\n\nGithub : https://github.com/thorchain\n\nOfficial Docs: https://docs.thorchain.org/\n\nCommunity Education: https://rebase.foundation/network/thorchain\n\n# Available Audits\n\nAll Audits Here : https://github.com/thorchain/Resources/tree/master/Audits\n\n* CertiK – token model and application security\n* Gauntlet – economic security & mechanism design\n* Kudelski Security – cryptography review\n* IOActive – node infrastructure\n\n# Benefits for Bancor & THORChain:\n\n* Unlocking deeper liquidity on the Bancor Network for Rune is mutually beneficial as THORChain users tend to be committed and long-term LP’s. Many users interacting with DeFi and the $RUNE asset specifically feel more comfortable having exposure to the asset strictly on the Ethereum network, it would be in Bancor’s best interest to give these HODLers a home to park their precious $RUNE and generate passive yield.\n\n* The whitelisting of $RUNE(ERC-20) would tap into one of the biggest, strongest communities in DeFi, Bancor would become the go-to for many $RUNE holders that would like to provide single-sided liquidity outside of the native THORChain ecosystem. This would generate massive attention for both Bancor & THORChain, with both combined boasting a massive ~$1.2 billion in liquidity (not considering liquidity bonded from THORChain nodes).\n* The whitelisting of the ERC-20 version of the $RUNE asset could solidify a strong bond between both project’s communities, in the sense that both communities would interact with each other's platforms and further discover new ways for providing liquidity/swapping. It’s also worth noting that Rune has previously shown an interest in bancor so the reciprocity of further collaboration is possible and one could see the Thorchain team listing us in return (Although this is not a guarantee). \n\nProposal created by [@_krris](https://twitter.com/_krris) & [@tenzents](https://twitter.com/Tenzents)\n\nThank you for your consideration and time.\n",

UNN did not have a public sale. UNN does not have an elastic supply or rebase mechanism. The UNN contract does not have permissions that grant administrators unrestricted mint capabilities. The Union token supply is fixed at 1,000,000,000, of which approximately 650,000,000 are in current circulation. The contracts and addresses with the highest concentrations of UNN tokens are predominantly the Union Treasury Wallet, Union Ecosystem Wallet, Union Supply Reserve Wallet, Uniswap lending pool, and AscendEx (formally BitMax) exchange wallets. Union core team tokens are following a vesting schedule of one year. The first token distributions to core team members will occur later this month and occur at even interval for the next six months. Union advisors are largely on a two-year vesting schedule. \n\n![image|674x500](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/bancordao/original/2X/3/3fd91c2127e0d475f3a87596d7429d2ffd1a85fb.jpeg)\n\n\n# Project\nUnion seeks to make DeFi safer and more accessible by offering full stack protection that reduces the risks and costs of DeFi. Union’s multi-token bundled protection model allows for tailored protection for composable risks. Union is not a traditional insurance company but a technology platform offering protection products. \n\nUnion soft launched its first protection product, collateral optimization protection (C-OP) about three weeks ago. [C-OP](https://c-op.unn.finance/) is a Defi derivative primitive that can be used as a standalone put option to either hedge risk or short assets. When integrated with a lending platform, C-OP allows a borrower to increase collateral factors to 100% while providing a lender the ability to greatly increase TVL with minimal additional risks. \n\nUnion’s second protection product, smart contract protection aka Union’s Crypto Default Swap (U-CDS) is currently in closed beta testing. U-CDS will simultaneously be audited next week. U-CDS are products that protect purchasers against event risk such as smart contract exploits, oracle manipulations, and rug pulls – and payout coverage is 100%. U-CDS allows project token holders peace of mind, project founders public accountability, and traders the ability to arbitrage pricing disparities based upon examined risk. \n\nUnion publishes weekly community updates on its [Medium](https://unn-finance-main.medium.com/) page. \n\n# Tokenomics\nUnion’s governance token UNN (ERC20) is not required to participate in Union’s products but is required for participation in governance and may also confer economic rewards such as reserve-share program.\n\n# Community and Communication\nUnion is active on [Telegram](https://t.me/UNNFinance), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/UNNFinance?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor), [Medium](https://unn-finance-main.medium.com/), and [GitHub](https://github.com/UNIONProtocolFoundation). In addition, Union is in the process of building out a [Gitbook](https://union-protocol.gitbook.io/union-protocol/). Union’s core team and advisors are presented on the [Union Website](https://www.unn.finance/). \n\n# Available Audits\nUnion has been audited three times in the past six months by industry leading auditors:\n* [Certik Audit](https://github.com/UNIONProtocolFoundation/union-protocol/blob/main/docs/audits/REP-Union_Protocol-29_12_2020.pdf) (December 2020) \n* [Cyber Unit Audit](https://github.com/UNIONProtocolFoundation/OC-Protection/blob/main/docs/audit/C-OPAudit_SANCTUM_MB-20210421_V1.pdf) (March 2021) \n* [Sanctum Security Audit](https://github.com/UNIONProtocolFoundation/OC-Protection/blob/main/docs/audit/C-OPAudit_SANCTUM_MB-20210421_V1.pdf) (April 2021) \n* Union also maintains an [open bug bounty program](https://immunefi.com/bounty/unionfinance/) with Immunefi (since April 2021) Union’s U-CDS will be audited prior to open beta and will also have an Immunefi bounty program.\n\n# Market and Trading Data\n* UNN’s price at the time of this writing is $0.0146 \n* All time high: $0.124 \n* All time low: $0.0118 \n* Price 90 days ago: $0.088 \n* 650,000,000 tokens in circulation (approx.) \n* 1,000,000,000 maximum supply \n* Market capitalization at the time of this writing is $9,005,798 \n* The UNN token is available on major exchanges including Uniswap, BitMart, AscendEx, and Gate.io. \n* The 24 hour trading volume at the time of this writing is $512,633.\n\n# Partnerships\nUnion has partnered with over 20 projects to integrate C-OP and/or U-CDS into their ecosystems. Projects include [Avalanche](https://www.avalabs.org/), [UniLend](https://unilend.finance/), [KSM Starter](https://ksmstarter.com/), [Prometeus](https://prometeus.io/), [Waves](https://bonded.finance/), [Moar](https://moardefi.finance/), [Prosper](https://prosper.so/), [Block Science](https://block.science/), [Bonded Finance](https://bonded.finance/), [Alphr](https://www.alphr.finance/), [Mattereum](https://mattereum.com/), [Kleros](https://kleros.io/). \n\n# Benefits for Bancor\n* C-OP can be integrated into the Bancor ecosystem to be used as a financial trading instrument which would allow Bancor users another tool for their trading strategies. \n* Bancor users can utilize C-OP in its current form as a standalone put option to either hedge risk or short assets. \n* Union will seed a pool on Bancor and drive Union LP holders to Bancor. At the time of this writing, there is just under two million dollars in total liquidity in the WETH/UNN Uniswap pool. \n* U-CDS can be integrated into the Bancor ecosystem for a protection pool against hacks and other identifiable user risks. \n* U-CDS can be integrated into the Bancor ecosystem for a protection pool to secure balances staked by Bancor users. \n* Union currently utilizes various geysers to reward LP providers. In the event Bancor can support such a program, Union would make a dedicated rewards geyser for UNN Bancor LP providers to further incentivize UNN Bancor liquidity.\n\n# Public Announcement\nBancor and Union shall jointly announce the UNN whitelisting and that their teams are working jointly towards incorporating C-OP into the Bancor platform.\n\n# Voting Instructions\n\n* Vote **FOR** to add UNN to the Bancor whitelist, with 20,000 BNT in single-sided staking capacity.\n* Vote **AGAINST** to deny UNN whitelisting status.",

The ANKR is backed by tier one team and has no plans to mint more tokens. The current token supply is set on\n\n10,000,000,000 fixed supply from which 6,996,232,711 are in current circulation.\n\nThe contracts and addresses with the highest concentration of ANKR are held by the ANKR team and sit on the exchanges.\n\n![|690x251](upload://qyVBh5m28sbvGarvt6Yc77B500e)\n\n# Project\n\nAnkr uses Cloud-Native, container-based environments to build its own architectural and resource allocation algorithm to include nearly all types of infrastructure resources. Cloud-Native allows Ankr to focus on its own technical details via integrating with various Cloud-Native solutions such as Observability & Analysis (Prometheus, Fluentd, Jaeger), Service Mesh and Discovery (Envoy, Istio), Streaming (GRPC), Application Definition (Helm) etc.\n\nUsing Ankr’s distributed cloud computing network (DCCN) platform, developers and operators using applications do not directly interact with infrastructure providers’ API’s. Instead, a local orchestrator handles resource allocation automatically. The Ankr DCCN system is deployed and distributed over the computing resources managed by Kubernetes across all geographic locations. Resources configured into clusters in Kubernetes are connected to each other via a specialized type of cluster called Ankr Hub. At this time Ankr Hubs are fully set up and controlled by Ankr and serve as nodes to relay and dispatch the computing tasks to other working clusters.\n\nWorking products:\n[Ankr - A World Powered by US ](https://app.ankr.com/apps/api) - open API\n\n[Ankr - A World Powered by US ](https://app.ankr.com/apps/market) - deploy node or maining facility\n\n[Ankr Web 3.0 infrastructure | Blockchain nodes & APIs | Ankr ](https://www.ankr.com/product) - calulaor\n\nhttps://eth2.ankr.com/ - eth 2.0 staking\n\n# Tokenomics\n\nAnkr tokens are used as the native currency on the Ankr cloud platform. That means cloud providers are being paid for their services in Ankr tokens. This ensures demand for the token. Consumers have to buy Ankr tokens in order to use the platform. Providers have to accept them in order to participate and earn money. There is no a possibility for investors to stake Ankr tokens yet. Therefor bancor would be the best place to stka ANKR tokens. In addition to that, Ankr tokens are being used as governance tokens to decide on future tokens development.\n\n# Investors:\n\n* Pantera Capital\n* AlphaCoin Fund\n* Basics fund\n* Bixin Capital\n* BlockoxFund\n* Carnaby Capital\n* Sailor Capital\n* DHVC\n* GT Blockchain Investments\n* Kosmos Capital\n* LinkVc\n* Lemniscap\n* LYVC\n* Node Capital\n* Nirvana Capital\n* OK Capital\n* Tenzor Capital LLC\n* TLDR CAPITAL\n* Torchlight Ventures\n* Lemniscap\n* MW Partners\n\nTeam\nCEO -Chandler Song, Forbes 30 under 30 engineering and investing experience (3 years) in the company for 2 years ([linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yunfansong/))\n\nCTO - Stanley W. prior Amazon software developer, lack of prior leadership exp, 1year in comp [(linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/stanley-w-5714a4163/))\n\nCOO - Ryan Fang Forbes 30 under 30 Investment Banking Analyst experience, lack of leadership exp, 2 years in comp ([linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ryan-fang-245011a2/))\n\nOverall 38 employees\n\n# Community and Communication\n\nANKR is active on [Reddit ](https://www.reddit.com/r/Ankrofficial/), [Telegram](https://t.me/ankrnetwork), and [Discord ](https://discord.com/invite/uYaNu23Ww7).

      "content": "# TL;DR\n\n* AXS Team migrated their token contract last month. There is now AXS and AXS (Legacy) listed on Bancor\n* Currently the BNT co-investment of 250k is being applied to the old AXS (Legacy) token\n* This proposal to is migrate that co-investment from the Legacy AXS token to the new token\n* Currently the AXS (Legacy) pool has far more liquidity. This will help to bring liquidity to the new migrated token\n* New Contract has been audited by Bancor Team.\n\n#### NEW Contract Address : 0xbb0e17ef65f82ab018d8edd776e8dd940327b28b\n\n#### Project Website:[ axieinfinity.com](http://axieinfinity.com/)\n\n#### Project Documentation: [https://whitepaper.axieinfinity.com/ ](https://whitepaper.axieinfinity.com/)\n\n# **Token Security**\n\nThe Axie Community continues to be a great part of the Bancor ecosystem and this is really a formality since the DAO has already approved the previous token address. The new contract has been deemed safe by the Bancor team and there are no issues that would deem it unsafe for whitelisting. Let’s get this passed quickly to ensure as little friction as possible to AXS Bancor LP providers in one of our growing number of constantly filled pools.\n\n\n# **Project Info**\n\nAxie is a battle pet universe that leverages NFTs and Blockchain technology to empower our players in new and exciting ways.\n\n\n![https___bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com_public_images_b883ea34-4ffe-4c64-8a18-32966a14ade3_2832x1788|690x435](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/bancordao/optimized/2X/8/8ce7ccafd17b497b85c0ea343616d3cd9fb08a30_2_690x435.jpeg)\n\n On the surface the game is about:\n\n\n\n * Battling fierce (but adorable) pets called Axies and earning cryptocurrency rewards.\n * Collecting super rare Axies with limited edition skins.\n * Building a land based kingdom where you can ally with friends and fight for control of resource nodes (this game mode is still in the pipeline).\n\n\n\nHowever, if you look more closely Axie is becoming its own digital nation with a complex economy and emerging tight-knight social structures.\n\n\n\nThe founding team met each other playing a game called Cryptokitties. We realized right away that NFTs would be huge, and knew that whoever could build out a fun game with an interesting in-game economy would play a major role in defining the future of gaming. Axie is our answer to that mission.\n\n\n\nWe hope that Bancor can see AXS as an opportunity to engage with an enthusiastic and dedicated new community of LPs. The Axie token is an atypical asset, representing the long tail that Bancor expressed a sincere wish to claim in its early documentation. Axie could be the gateway token to capturing the attention of a growing culture surrounding recreational blockchain utility. As our community becomes integrated within Bancor, we can help to facilitate engagement with adjacent projects, and help to drive further adoption of BNT. Our story is a cautionary one, and you will find no greater advocate for the profound value of Bancor’s IL protection than with us.",

      "content": "# TL;DR\n\n* Create extra space for ETH deposits.\n* Enable a limit change from 30 million BNT, up to 50 million BNT minting limits on ETHBNT pool\n* The limit can only be increased by 2M BMI, only if there is no space to stake ETH\n* There has to be at least 5 days break between each limit increase\n\nVote “for” to enable this change, or vote “against” not to enable it.\n\n### Background\n\nWith the acceptance of BIP5 by Governance and the recent contract upgrade, the DAO can now set hard limits for BNT co-investments by the protocol on a per-pool basis.\n\nThis proposal seeks to exercise this new feature by significantly increasing the co-investment limits on ETH from 30,000,000 BNT, to a maximum of 50,000,000 BNT.\n\nThe co-investment will be increased gradually with 2M BNT tranches. Effect on the network of the underlying limits increase will be tightly monitored.\n\n### The anticipated positive effects are:\n\n1. An immediate increase in TVL.\n\nIncreased co-investment limits allow for additional single-sided token staking by both ETH holders. ETH pool currently has a limited capacity to attract ETH in big chunks. We witnessed a higher than usual demand and requested from big market players to stake ETH with Bancor.\n\n2. An increase in the Bancor Vortex burn rate.\n\nThe ETH pool proved a minimal insurance liability during the initial phase of V2.1. Trade revenue on ETH pool is one of the main contributors to Bancor Vortex burning protocol. Increasing the co-investment limit will increase trading volume and Bancor Vortex burns activity.\n\n3. Passive staking of ETH.\n\nMore and more ETH of big players is looking for a safe harbor to part their ETH for an upcoming bear market. Bancor, so far Bancor is one of the safest places with attractive ETH denominated yield. There are other places such as Lido, but this lock ETH until the 2.0 release. Therefore we have seen increased demand for ETH staking\n\n### Summary:\n\nETH pool is one of the most important pools on BNT. It has been proven a low IL liability with high upside for the network, not only because of accommodating a lion share of TVL but also because of producing relevant revenue and causing significant Bancor Vortex Burn.\nThe careful limit increase will allow luring capital from big and long term players on the market that will support not only protocol TVL but likely to back Bancor on the media.",

      "content": "[Read the original proposal on Discourse](https://gov.bancor.network/t/proposal-experiment-to-assess-effect-of-0-1-swap-fee-on-usdt-stable-coin-pool/2421/12)\n\n**TL;DR**\n\n* There is a lack of data to inform decisions about appropriate swap fee levels\n* We can utilize Bancor as a test-bed to run experiments to collect data\n* Run a 14 day experiment lowering the swap fee on USDT stable coin (from 0.2% to 0.1%)\n* At the end of the experimental period (14 days) USDT swap fee will return to the status quo (0.2%)\n* Assess the effect on swap volumes and APY relative to other stable coins (USDC, DAI, swap fee 0.2%) to see the effect on swap fee apy\n\n**Introduction**\nThere has been much discussion on the potential for changing swap fees on large Bancor pools to drive increased liquidity, but quantitative, real-world data is lacking. Data that has been collected previously is not directly comparable to the current competitive DEX environment and liquidity pools.\n\nIn essence, the challenge in setting an appropriate fixed swap fee centers on the swap fee paradox: higher swap fees are attractive to LPs at the expense of traders, while low swap fees are attractive to traders but at the expense of liquidity and therefore slippage.\n\nThis proposal seeks to run a carefully controlled experiment to collect real world data on the effect of lowering the swap fee on a stable coin pool (USDT). Stable coins are primarily utilitarian with traders acting in a mercenary fashion seeking primarily for price stability and with little or no 'community'. Thus stable coins should be very sensitive to swap fees. The experiment is designed to use other stable coin pools (USDC, DAI) as controls to allow assessment of the effects of the changes. At the end of the experiment, pool fees will return to the status quo, and the data will be analyzed and used to support future experiments and proposals around changes to swap fees.\n\n**The Experiment**\n\nChange the swap fee on the medium sized stable coin pool USDT to 0.1% for 14 days. At the end of 14 days, the swap fee is returned to the status quo (0.2%).\n\nThis experiment will allow the effect of changing the swap fee on one stable coin to be compared to other similar stable coins (USDC and DAI) that will act as controls. By running the experiment over a short period with LM rewards activated we avoid the potential for major external events to impact the experiment and minimize the risk of liquidity flight.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nSwap fees on pools is a common topic of discussion but is mostly based on opinion rather than fact. This proposal offers a controlled, short term experiment to provide real world data that can be assessed to quantify the effect of lowering swap fees on performance.  More generally, this proposal could act as a template for proposing future experiments to help optimize the operation of Bancor.\n\n**Voting Instructions**\n\n* Vote FOR to run the stable coin experiment: Change the swap fee on USDT pool to 0.1% for 14 days. Day 14, return to 0.2%.\n* Vote NO. Do not make any changes.",

We are not the pool with the highest liquidity and hence don't have much market power. \n\n![](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/bancordao/original/2X/3/3914f0faac57c7e21273c2e2ef9eefd2db4a31e4.png)\n\nThe above doesn’t count Uniswap V3 which has 15M in liquidity on the MKR-ETH pair:\n\n![](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/bancordao/optimized/2X/d/d2d82a2d968330dec1d224ad87ab011e21a6e0be_2_445x500.png)\n\nCompare to us at ~23M:\n\n![](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/bancordao/original/2X/a/a40156d180906ddbf88cb726bd6087ffe2c27392.png)\n\nThe fees for these pools are set between .16%-.3% at the moment. I think that even at .2% that we will be pricing ourselves out as the hop from ETH-BNT trading pair would put us at .35%. If the ETH-BNT pool fees go down to their original value (.10%) then we would be at Uni/Sushi levels (Balancer v1/v2 are at .2% and .16% respectively) if we set the fees to .2% on this pool. \n\nI think that going down to .1% is better for this pair as right now anything that's above ~$800 doesn't go to us **even if you are swapping BNT-MKR** through 1inch:\n\n![](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/bancordao/optimized/2X/4/49d5e7f9d561e276d692f1d333bf8209c6229cc4_2_690x172.png)\n\nthat’s wild. It would much rather swap the BNT to ETH and go somewhere else. We don’t come into the picture again until the swap is ~550K:\n\n![](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/bancordao/optimized/2X/5/56e79f57e4b1e0179fb201bb21c373c07e0c37a2_2_690x278.png)\n\nand even then we are only getting 10% of the trade. I will emphasize again that this is BNT → MKR swap and intuitively one would expect trades between $800-$500K to come in our direction when swapping directly (that’s not happening).\n",

      "content": "Read the original proposal on [Discourse](https://gov.bancor.network/t/bancordao-whitelist-proposal-farm-harvest-finance/2444)\n\n# TL;DR\n\n* Proposal to whitelist FARM.\n* Harvest will add initial liquidity of $500,000 USD FARM\n* Harvest is seeking a co-investment of 500,000 BNT - this number was chosen to enable Bancor to be the deepest liquidity pool for FARM.\n* Harvest Finance continues to innovate and deploy new strategies, further driving value through the platform and the $FARM profit share token\n* Once the liquidity depth at Bancor exceeds the depth at Uniswap, the platforms profit share mechanism can be pointed at Bancor instead\n\nFARM token address: 0xa0246c9032bC3A600820415aE600c6388619A14D\n\nProject Website: [https://Harvest.Finance/](https://harvest.finance/)\n\nBenefits for Bancor:\n\nHarvest Finance is a leader in cutting edge strategies, and as it continues to upgrade the protocol and increase profit to FARM holders, demand for the token will continue to rise while emissions taper off to zero. The buy pressure from the profit share mechanism which continuously buys FARM from the open market with profits derived from the protocol, also helps to ensure constant volume and price support for the token. This buyback mechanism can be pointed at the Bancor FARM pool once it exceeds the liquidity size currently placed at Uniswap. This would become a very consistent and sizable fee source for Bancor LPs.\n\n# Project\n\nLaunched in August 2020, Harvest Finance is an automatic yield farming protocol that helps depositors take advantage of the latest DeFi platforms with the highest yield. With over 100+ strategies deployed, the protocol offers one of the most cutting edge and competitive portfolios of yield in DeFi while still making it simple for any user to participate. Harvest is also very ecosystem focused, regularly contributing to Gitcoin grants and collaborating with various projects such as PerpFi, Pendle, Babylon Finance, APWine Finance, CompliFi and Convex.\n\n# Tokenomics\n\nHarvest Finances native token, FARM (ERC20), is a governance and revenue sharing token that affords the holder voting rights on the protocol, and when staked, collects a prorated share of the 30% performance fee charged to protocol users. Over the past 90 days the protocol was generating $8M per month in yield farming profits, with $2.4M monthly flowing to FARM stakers.\n\nThe FARM token supply is set at 690,420, of which 554,354 are in current circulation. This was reduced by governance vote from the initial, [contract-enforced](https://etherscan.io/token/0xa0246c9032bC3A600820415aE600c6388619A14D#readContract) hard cap of 5M tokens. The contracts and addresses with the highest concentration of FARM tokens are predominantly the profit share vault and the UniSwap liquidity pools. The team wallets and vesting contracts are discussed [here](https://medium.com/harvest-finance/the-harvest-finance-project-338c3e5806fc). And the supply reduction [here](https://medium.com/harvest-finance/week-5-the-power-of-69-6c8346ec3d8d).\n![](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/bancordao/original/2X/4/41ad8d832991fd0961041f51a441482d702d0a73.png)\n\n# Community and Communication\n\nHarvest is active on [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/HarvestFinance/), [Telegram](https://t.me/Breadforthepeople), [WeChat](https://blog.chain.link/chainlink-chinese-communities/), [Weibo](https://weibo.com/chainlinkofficial), [Discord,](https://discord.gg/8WDrQZ4) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/harvest_finance). Activity on [GitHub](https://github.com/harvest-finance) is frequent, with new updates appearing weekly. The core development team is anonymous, preferring to focus on code and product security, while allowing its community members to help develop tools, strategies, and guide the day to day social operations of the protocol. Discord chat is the main hub for communicating directly with the core developers, and with 20+ channels and various languages, the Harvest community is very diverse and active. The protocol is also actively seeking talented developers and contributors, which can be seen on the Work page [here](https://harvest.finance/work). A multiSig run by key community members helps to perform various tasks such as builder payroll, and select execution of protocol functions. As Harvest continues to mature, more functions are handed off to the community, adding to its decentralization and cooperative style of management.\n\n# Available Audits\n\nHarvest has been audited multiple times, with all results posted on the Github [here](https://github.com/harvest-finance/harvest/tree/master/audits). The most recent was published by Least Authority in Feb 2021 and can be found [here](https://github.com/harvest-finance/harvest/blob/master/audits/LeastAuthority-Harvest.pdf).\n\n* Harvest also maintains an [open bug bounty program](https://immunefi.com/bounty/harvest/).\n\n# Market and Trading Data\n\n* FARM’s price at the time of writing is $60.90 ([Coingecko](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/harvest-finance), [CMC](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/harvest-finance/))\n* All-time low: $54.30 (23rd May, 2021)\n* All-time high: $458 (12th February, 2021)\n* Price 90 days ago: $245.55 (9th March, 2021)\n* 554,354 tokens in circulation (80% max supply)\n* 690,420 planned maximum supply\n* The current market capitalization is $34,343,000.\n* The FARM token is available on Uniswap, Hoo, Gate, BiKi\n* The 24-hour spot volumes $2.4M",

      "content": "### Contract Address: 0xff56cc6b1e6ded347aa0b7676c85ab0b3d08b0fa\n\nProject Website: https://www.orbs.com/\n\n### Discussion\n\nOrbs is a public blockchain infrastructure designed for mass usage applications and close integration with Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)-based Layer 1 protocols such as Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain. Orbs infrastructure is ***open and permissionless***, unlike private and permissioned blockchain solutions that are typically used for such applications. The Orbs protocol is decentralized and executed by a public network of permissionless guardians using Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus. The Orbs protocol relies on the ORBS token, which is used for the settlement of fees related to app execution and provides the system of incentives used to elect validating nodes (who are referred to as “Guardians”) in a secure and decentralized manner. The Orbs project includes a full blockchain stack designed and implemented from scratch by the core team, and is not a fork of any existing solution. The project is active on open source with over 150 repositories publicly available on [Github](https://github.com/orbs-network/website). The codebase provides an end-to-end developer experience with everything needed to create and execute blockchain applications.\n\n### Tokenomics\n\nAs the native token for the network, the Orbs platform relies on the ORBS Token to fuel network operation and provide the means to pay the fees involved with operation of the consensus layer, execution of smart contracts and consensus-based storage, which are the three primary services provided by the platform - very similar how Ethereum relies on ETH to pay for smart contract execution. ORBS Tokens are also used to participate in the network’s proof-of-stake ecosystem - where tokens holders delegate their tokens to Guardians in order to elect them for the consensus committee.\n\nThe token distribution plan, beginning from the Orbs Network’s TDE on March 28, 2019, is as follows:\n\n* 55% for long term reserves for development, ecosystem and partners, including PoS rewards (vesting over 55 months from TDE)\n* 20% Team (vesting over 36 months from TDE)\n* 5% Advisors (vesting over 12 months from TDE)\n* 20% Private Token Sale (no vesting/lockup)\n\nFor additional details (including wallet addresses for each of the pools), see here: https://www.orbs.com/orbs-token-distribution/.\n\nOrbs Guardians represent the Orbs community; they maintain the security of the network and they invest time and efforts in the network’s success. As the most significant stakeholders in the network, they are most suitable to provide applications developers the required security and availability. The Orbs Universe provides community members that are not constantly active an opportunity to contribute to the network by delegating their stake to Guardians.\n\nOrbs Guardians and Delegators are eligible to receive rewards for their contribution to the network. Guardians are responsible for the [staking rewards distribution](https://orbs-network.github.io/website/white-papers/orbs-pos-v2-the-age-of-guardians-section-rewards-distributions) to their community of Delegators. Staked tokens of both Guardians and Delegators are locked in the Orbs staking smart contract and are subject to a 14-day cooldown period prior to any withdrawal.\n\nThere is no minimum staking amount for Delegators. Guardians are required to have a self-stake of at least 8% of their total delegated stakes.\n\nA maximum annual reward equal to 12% of total delegated stake is awarded to participants in the PoS Universe. ⅓ of the rewards are guaranteed to the Guardians (i.e., up to 4% annual reward maximum), while the default values for the distribution application grant the remaining ⅔ to Delegators (up to 8% annual reward maximum). With the latest upgrades to the PoS Universe, a new automated mechanism to set the level of rewards that will be distributed to their Delegators was enabled at the protocol level and featured as part of the updated Guardian interface. The mechanism calculates the amount of rewards that each of the Guardian’s Delegators is entitled to, based on the Delegators’ stake over time and the allocated ratio. The new automated tool allows the Guardians to modify the Delegators’ rewards split, while a minimum rate of compensation to Guardians is imposed by the protocol.\n\nThe staking reward is capped at 80M Orbs Tokens annually. If a larger percentage of Orbs token holders participates, the reward is allocated pro rata according to the Guardians’ effective delegated stake.\n\n### Community and Communication\n\nThe Orbs Network is a community-based project and cannot succeed without the collective effort of all participants, including the Orbs development team, Guardians, users and token holders. The Guardians are the key players responsible for network security and operation and are also expected to build a community of Delegators that trust them to truthfully represent their and the network’s interests. Guardians typically manage their own community channels, in addition to the channels run by the project development team. The recent updates providing the Guardians with the ability to set the level of rewards that will be distributed to their respective Delegators further tightens their relationships with their communities.\n\nThe Orbs team is highly engaged with its community through a plethora of channels such as: [Telegram](https://t.me/OrbsNetwork), Kakao, [Twitter](https://twitter.com/orbs_network), [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/sswGDYGBt5), [Orbs blog](https://www.orbs.com/blog/) and others. Orbs updates these channels on a regular basis to keep its community on top of the latest news. The best place to closely follow the project and read [all about it](https://www.orbs.com/white-papers/) is the Orbs [website](https://www.orbs.com), which is available in three languages - English, [Korean](https://www.orbs.com/ko/) and [Japanese](https://www.orbs.com/jp/). Orbs entire source code is available, as an open source, on [GitHub](https://github.com/orbs-network/website).\n\nThe Orbs ecosystem consists of dozens of partners all across the blockchain industry, and provides an invaluable insight to the project’s level of deep connections, partnerships, collaborations and integrations.\n\n### Available Audits\n\nOrbs received security audits on the token smart contract in May 2018 from SmartDEC, 80Trill and Bok Consulting Pty Ltd.\n\nIn February-March 2020, Orbs received additional security audits from SmartDEC and Bok Consulting Pty Ltd. on the V.2 smart contracts.\n\nAudit reports are available at:\n\n* https://github.com/orbs-network/orbs-staking-contract/blob/master/Orbs_Staking_SmartDec.pdf\n*  https://github.com/bokkypoobah/OrbsTokenSmartContractAudit\n* https://github.com/bokkypoobah/OrbsSubscriptionSmartContractAudit/tree/alpha/audit\n* https://github.com/bokkypoobah/OrbsStakingContractAudit/tree/master/audit\n\n### Market and Trading Data\n\nhttps://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/orbs/markets/\n\n### References and Additional Links\n\nOrbs white papers - https://www.orbs.com/white-papers/\n\nOrbs GitHub - https://github.com/orbs-network/website\n\nOrbs Twitter - https://twitter.com/orbs_network\n\nOrbs Telegram channel - https://t.me/OrbsNetwork\n\nOrbs Discord - https://discord.com/invite/sswGDYGBt5\n\nOrbs Market Data - https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/orbs/markets/\n\nContact Orbs - https://orbs-network.github.io/website/contact/",

      "content": "Read the original proposal on [Discourse](https://gov.bancor.network/t/bancordao-whitelist-proposal-whitelist-lqty/2440/1)\n\n# BancorDAO Whitelist Proposal : Whitelist LQTY\n\n# TL;DR\n\n* Proposal to whitelist LQTY.\n* Proposed co-investment is 150,000 BNT to match the size of LQTY Uniswap pool\n* There are no apparent security concerns that would prohibit whitelist status.\n* There is no reason to doubt the legitimacy of Liquity Protocol.\n* The benefit to Bancor is clear.\n\nLQTY token address: 0x6dea81c8171d0ba574754ef6f8b412f2ed88c54d\n\nProject Website: https://www.liquity.org/\n\n# Project\n\nLiquity is a decentralized borrowing protocol that allows users to draw interest-free loans against Ether as collateral (akin to MakerDAO). Loans are paid out in LUSD (USD-pegged stablecoin) and need to maintain a minimum collateral ratio of 110%. Loans are secured by the [Stability Pool](https://docs.liquity.org/faq/stability-pool-and-liquidations), where users can deposit LUSD and provide up-front capital to offset uncollateralized debt. In return, they receive ETH collateral when liquidations occur and continuous LQTY rewards (our secondary token).\n\nIn addition to Liquity’s focus on capital-efficiency, the protocol is also fully decentralized. Liquity contracts have no admin keys and will be accessible via multiple interfaces hosted by different Frontend Operators, making it censorship resistant. The protocol is also governance-free, as all operations are algorithmic and fully automated, and protocol parameters to maintain system health were set at time of contract deployment.\n\nAfter launching on April 5th, 2021, Liquity now has $3B total value locked within the protocol.\n\n# Token Distribution\n\n100,000,000 LQTY were minted at genesis, and are allocated as follows:\n![](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/bancordao/original/2X/3/34a5b8f787bd76a3c1b20c57a8f00716314bd6f0.png)\n\n35.3% to the Liquity Community: 32M allocated to the Stability Pool and frontend operators, ~1.3M to reward Uniswap ETH/LUSD LPs (ended), 2M to the Community Reserve which is used to fund grants, hackathons, events, and other community-focused efforts.\n\n23.7% to Team and Advisors: ~24M allocated to current and future Liquity AG employees/advisors, which are all under a 1 year lockup and are 1/4 vested after 1 year of engagement, then 1/36 every month after.\n\n33.9% to Investors: ~34M allocated to Liquity’s early investors who supported our vision and provided the runway necessary for us to succeed long term - 1 year lockup period.\n\n6.1% to Liquity AG Endowment: ~6M allocated to Liquity AG for use by the company - 1 year lockup period.\n\n1% to Service Providers: ~1M LQTY allocated to service providers who helped Liquity in various ways before launch - 1 year lockup period.\n\n# Tokenomics\n\nLiquity’s native token, LQTY (ERC20), is used as a reward mechanism within the Liquity ecosystem as stated previously. Furthermore, LQTY can be staked to capture 100% of protocol fees (paid in LUSD & ETH) with no additional risks added such as token slashing to backstop the system. Since launch on April 5th, stakers have been paid $12.6M in protocol revenue.\n\n# Community and Communication\n\nLiquity is mainly active on [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/2up5U32), but we do have an announcement-only [Telegram](https://t.me/liquityprotocol) and [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Liquity/). The Liquity team also operates official [Twitter](https://twitter.com/LiquityProtocol) and [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEAFfXgbL5J_BgSTxG07ARw) accounts. Activity on [GitHub](https://github.com/liquity) is frequent, with new updates usually appearing on a daily basis. The Liquity team, advisors, and partners are present on the [Liquity website](https://www.liquity.org/team). Robert Lauko, the Founder and CEO of Liquity AG, is the project’s main spokesperson. The Liquity website includes a mailing address in Switzerland, and one contact e-mail.\n\nMailing: Untere Raintrasse 64, 6340 Baar, Switzerland\n\nContact: contact@liquity.org\n\n# Available Audits\n\nLiquity has been audited four times this year (2021), by reputable auditors:\n\n* [Trail of Bits Security Assessment (Jan 2021)](https://github.com/trailofbits/publications/blob/master/reviews/Liquity.pdf)\n* [Audit by Coinspect (March 2021)](https://www.coinspect.com/liquity-audit/)\n* [Trail of Bits Liquity Protocol and Stability Pool Final Report (March 2021) ](https://github.com/trailofbits/publications/blob/master/reviews/LiquityProtocolandStabilityPoolFinalReport.pdf)\n* [Trail of Bits Liquity Proxy Contracts Report (March 2021) ](https://github.com/trailofbits/publications/blob/master/reviews/LiquityProxyContracts.pdf)\n* Liquity also maintains an [open bug bounty program](https://docs.liquity.org/documentation/bug-bounty).\n\n# Market and Trading Data\n\n* LQTY’s price at the time of writing is $7.34\n* All-time high: $73.18 (April 5th, 2021 - first day of launch)\n* All-time low: $6.60 (June 17th, 2021)\n* 4,878,856 tokens in circulation\n* 100,000,000 maximum supply.\n* The current market capitalization is $35,831,645\n* The 24-hour spot volumes range from $400,000 to >$1,000,000.\n\n# Benefits for Bancor:\n\nAs of right now, the majority of earned LQTY makes its way to Liquity’s staking contract because being an LP on Uniswap seems to be less favorable at the moment. However, a Bancor whitelisting with impermanent loss protection and a potential opportunity for LM rewards could encourage existing Uniswap LPs for LQTY to migrate and could convince some LQTY holders to leave the staking pool in order to provide liquidity — making Bancor a primary hub for LQTY liquidity and volume. The team and community could also help spread awareness around the pool if approved, attracting new users to the Bancor ecosystem.",

Built on Ethereum, our platform allows users to tokenize real-world assets and subsequent lending. We’ve obtained financing licenses in four countries and operate compliantly and legally in top markets around the globe, maintaining safety as a top priority and fostering enhanced trust in the lending/borrowing process.\n\nThere are two main components to the NAOS protocol: Formation, which is our liquidity protocol, and Galaxy, which is our lending protocol. In addition to working with all major lending protocols for sources of lending capital, NAOS is designed from day one to be a self-sufficient lending protocol. Galaxy is the conduit between real-world assets and DeFi liquidity, and the protocol is designed to work behind the scenes. More details on our product roadmap can be found [here](https://medium.com/naos-finance/behold-naos-finance-product-roadmap-2c3d9fc38ab4).\n\nWe also submitted our first [MIP6 application](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/pa-drop-mip6-application-us-based-supply-chain-finance-for-large-oems/7787) with MakerDao to fund our first real world asset. We are working with a US-based supply chain finance services company that services OEMs in the electronics and semiconductor industry, and works only with OEM-directed spend. The community greenlight poll (first go/no-go decision) on May 31st was 75% yes.\n\nIn the effort to emulate the traditional banking experience on-chain, we’re also working closely with partners in oracle, insurance and retail distribution to build a RWA based DeFi ecosystem.\n\nThe development team, advisors and investors are presented on the [team](https://naos.finance/team) tab on the NAOS website. NAOS Finance is backed by top tier strategic investors including Coinbase Ventures, Huobi, OKex, Mechanism Capital, Lemniscap, Maven 11, Hashkey Capital, Collider Ventures, CMS among others. \n\n# Tokenomics\nThe NAOS Token is a governance token that serves multiple purposes in ensuring the health and growth of the network. At a high-level, the token is intended to serve two key functions:\n\nGovernance: Vote and decide on important matters such as approving an asset’s onboarding, setting the interest rate on an asset, setting token the buyback strategy, determining the reward rate for different liquidity pools and determining the utilization of ecosystem funds.\n\nStaking: We have allocated the largest portion of our token for our community to earn NAOS tokens by providing liquidity. What differentiates NAOS Finance from the other DeFi-centric protocols is that the staking pools are designed to fund real world asset lending.\n\nMore details on our Tokenomics can be found [here](https://medium.com/naos-finance/naos-finance-community-newsletter-tokenomics-a0caadfb26ce). \n\n# Community and Communication\nNAOS is active on [Telegram](https://t.me/naos_finance) and [Discord](https://discord.gg/qThcuS7FBd). The NAOS team also operates an official [Twitter](https://twitter.com/naos_finance) account. Our community consists of 65% English speakers, 15% Chinese speakers, 8% Russian speakers, 4% Korean speakers, 3% German speakers and 3% French speakers.

We will pick 10 voters, based on taking the total number of voters in order of votes received, dividing the total by 10, and picking the first voter in each group, for an airdrop of 100 NAOS tokens each. In that way, voters are treated equally regardless of which way they vote.",

      "content": "TL;DR\n\n1. The LM rewards structure on the stablecoin pools is proposed to be changed. The rewards emissions are halved, from 50k to 25k BNT per week\n2. The distribution of the rewards remains the same (70% to the BNT side, 30% to TKN side)\n3. The change is being made in order to gradually decrease rewards on pools with stable tokens.\n4. The change is now possible, due to low gas cost.\n\nDiscussion\n\nDue to Bancor V2.1 single asset exposure and IL protection, and because the stable pools do not appreciate with the rest of the market, the current APY on the TKN side of the stable pools is unsustainably high.\n\n1. The 3 stablecoin pools currently have around 15M stable assets each locked on the TKN side, which is entitled to 30,000 BNTs a month each (if 2x multiplier applied), providing around 50% APY on TKN and 70% on the BNT side.\n2. The emissions change would reduce APY to around 20-30% on TKN and around 35-40% on BNT side (all else held equal).\n3. The above APY is still among the most profitable, risk-minimised staking yield for stable assets in DeFi on the Ehtereum network.\n4. The reason for the change is stablecoin pools incur a higher than normal impermanent loss cost on the network due to the inherent divergence between the price of USD and BNT.\n5. The change is being made in anticipation of a Bancor V3.\n6. Until the new solution is live, we anticipate the gradual reduction of rewards will not cause significant outflow of capital and will decrease the emission of BNT tokens by 600K BNT, monthly.\n\nLiquidity mining halving and rewards re-distribution:\n\nProposing halving LM rewards on stable pools.\nInstead of 50,000 BNTs per week, 25,000 BNTs per week will be distributed to each pool (2x more if considering multiplier logic)\nPools considered for 30 days extension and rewards halving:\n\n* DAI\n* USDC\n* USDT\n\nThe Alternative is Not Economically Sound\n\nThe alternative approach would be to increase the investment caps on stable tokens; however:\n\n* Stablecoin pools are, at present, the single greatest cost to the protocol in terms of IL expenses. Increasing the caps would only exacerbate the problem.\n* Decreasing the emissions gradually over time poses high gas costs to the network in terms of contract upgrades.\n\nSummary\n\n* Bancor should not lose the momentum and cut out the LM rewards on stablecoins.\n* Considering the change in the rewards redistribution, the APY should still be maintained on a highly competitive level.\n* The new solution for stable tokens is around the corner. Therefore, the maintenance of stablecoin liquidity incentives is a temporary problem.",

The project seeks to fuse innovative characteristics of blockchain technology with PropTech through an intuitive mass-adoption oriented platform.\n\nRentible serves a clear purpose now and in the future as a first-mover in a massive yet untapped segment of the market.\n\nExamples for problems that Rentible seeks to remedy:\n|Problem & Real life example|Solution|\n| --- | --- |\n|Fraudulent deposit & let-and-run schemes|Online scammers using fake/stolen ID’s to extract downpayment deposits (i.e - a student from Spain moving to London and sending in advance hundreds of GBP as downpayment for a property that doesn’t exist). More than £918 million lost due to similar online property rental fraud in the UK alone over a year|\n|Accessibility & Gateway|“less-savvy” homeowners don’t know how to open a wallet such as MetaMask, yet had they received their rent in BTC in 2020, their yield would have quadrupled (if not more) in 2021. As an intuitive platform, Rentible will serve as a gateway not only for crypto enthusiasts, but also to newcomers into the cryptosphere whom are looking for an intuitive way to send/receive rent-related payments in cryptocurrency but don’t know where to start|\n|Liquidity|It is common that a person gets stuck without being able to pay rent for a week or doesn’t have available funds to put down a deposit on a flat, while on the other hand - the person can’t get an immediate loan or prefers not to sell their crypto as they expect it will appreciate. Rentible’s community pool will enable participants and token holders to put ETH for example as collateral in order to draw a short term bridge loan to gap this situation|\n|Deposit withholding|Many times landlords / agencies withhold deposits from tenants upon expiry of the agreement, often unjustifiably, and as the tenant returns to their countries (i.e. in the case of an International student), they can’t mitigate this from afar. This can be solved by automated release of deposits combined with community arbitration in case of dispute between landlord/tenant|\n|Multisig contract processing|When signing a rental agreement between several parties hosted in different regions (I.e., a homeshare with several rooms), there’s a period in which one of the parties is delayed in signing the contract leaving the other parties exposed to unexpected changes in the agreement. Automating disbursement and recording of rental-related payments (mainly for good order and trackability)|\n|High fees|Lowering costs via disintermediation and decreasing dependency on renal agencies, allowing tighter more controlled screening process for landlords|\n\n# Tokenomics\nRentible’s native utility token (RNB) is required to gain beneficial access to the platform’s functions as well as participate in the ecosystem’s network and services. Platform’s services benefited through the usage of RNB include: discounts on uploading property listings, highlighting features, calling for execution smart contracts such as deposit payments and rental agreements, verification of title deeds, discounts across 3rd party service partnerships, privileges for accessing community liquidity pool, governance, participation in arbitration protocol, and access to accelerated staking program for an initial period of 12 months. In addition, 525,000 will be moved from transaction fees to the vault and subjected to the community’s governance.\n\n# Community and Communication\nRentible is active on [Telegram](https://t.me/rentible) (1170 members), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Rentible_io) (1610 followers), [Medium](https://medium.com/rentible-io), and [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/rentible/). YouTube channel will include discussion panels and platform versions reviews as developments and mockups rollout to the public. As part of its expansion into new audiences, translations of material to Chinese already started and community building in WeChat and Weibo via local community representatives will follow. The technical community can review the work on [GitHub](https://github.com/rentible), where development activities are available open-source. RNB token has [800 holders.](https://etherscan.io/token/0x2a039b1d9bbdccbb91be28691b730ca893e5e743) Team is fully presented on the website, AMA’s are being held weekly and the community can directly reach the team via social networks and provided email addresses.\n\n# Market and Trading Data\n* Token launch date: 1 May 2021\n* Launch price: $0.023\n* All-time high $5.53 (4 May)\n* All-time low: $0.023\n* Price at the time of wiring is $0.61\n* Total Supply: 3,500,000\n* Circulating supply: 1,713,000\n* Diluted market cap is $2,157,198\n* RNB is available on Uniswap (516,127 pooled RNB) \n\n# Benefits for Bancor:\n\nSingle-Sided Liquidity will be a catalyst in driving new and existing members to move their staking to Bancor from Uniswap, as well as increased exposure via marketing efforts on the project’s channels to promote the whitelisting. As the Rentible project has a clear mainstream usability and a long term technological roadmap, trading volume is projected to increase in tandem with the platform’s growth and expansion into new locations.\n\n# Voter Incentives:\n\nCurrent RNB token holders benefit from a very generous staking program as details [here](https://medium.com/rentible-io/introducing-the-rentible-staking-program-66013cc66bbd) for early adopters on Uniswap as well as accessibility to raffles, which can be extended to Bacnor voters and contributors to the pool.",

Making us the largest DEX pool.\n* It will open up space on the TKN side (LRC) and potentially lead to an increase in the depth of the pool as LPs add liquidity.\n* A larger LRC pool will attract more trades from aggregators and make us able to handle higher amount trades.\n\n**Abstract**\n\nLoopring is one of the top 100 Tokens on the Ethereum network and sees a good amount of volume from top CEXs. Increasing the size of our pool will make us the largest pool in the DEX Space and also possibly see some of the volume move from the Centralized Space into Bancor.\n\n**Motivation**\n\nThe current pool of LRC has remained relatively full since its inception. In order to become a top DEX we should want all the top pools for all the top tokens and LRC will continue to be a top 100 token.\n\n![](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/bancordao/optimized/2X/0/03210bdaf9d2b1ee1c02a34959fd353a38455b05_2_690x285.jpeg)\n\nCurrent CEX Pools.\n\n![](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/bancordao/optimized/2X/7/791f79af8851177bb7f9edda1467355ea686b6e3_2_690x319.png)\n\n**For**\n\n1. A larger co-investment limit on the pool will let LPs provided single sided liquidity and will lead to an increase in pool depth.\n2. More liquidity in the LRC-BNT pool should lead to larger volume from DEX aggregators and professional market makers sent in our direction\n\n**Against**\n\n1. We should not increase the limit on the pool\n2. We do not need extra liquidity in our platform to support larger trades",

Holo held an \"initial community offering\" from March 2018 through April 2018. Ultimately, 177.6 billion HOT was minted through a demand-determined process, with 133.2 billion HOT (75%) allocated for public sale and 44.4 billion HOT (25%) reserved for the team and company. Team tokens were not subject to vesting or lock-up periods. So, 177.6 billion HOT is treated as if it is in circulation.\n\nOnce HoloFuel is launched, HOT tokens will be able to be swapped at a one-to-one ratio for HoloFuel tokens. In January 2019, Holo stated that instead of being immediately burned, the swapped HOT will instead be kept as a reserve currency to provide liquidity to HoloFuel holders.\n\nThe contracts and addresses with the highest concentration of HOT tokens are Binance wallets and investor wallets.\n\nhttps://etherscan.io/token/0x6c6ee5e31d828de241282b9606c8e98ea48526e2#balances\n\n![](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/bancordao/optimized/2X/5/57f8338e8303f38bebae3b86c5f2dbd8174674ca_2_602x364.jpeg)\n# Project\n\nHolo is a peer-to-peer distributed platform for hosting decentralized applications built using Holochain, a framework for developing DApps that does not require the use of blockchain technology. The goal of Holo is to serve as a bridge between the broader internet and apps built using Holochain, offering an ecosystem and marketplace in which DApps are easily accessible, as they are hosted on the internet by Holo network participants.\n\nThe Holo network will be facilitated using a token called HoloFuel, which is actively being tested on HoloPorts that were shipped to indiegogo backers in 2020 and will act as an accounting system to pay hosts for their services. A decentralised chat application and turn-based games such as chess are being tested on the current network of HoloPorts. Current testing focus is on end-user UX, developer experience, security and scalability of the decentralised network.\n\nHolo is designed to act as a bridge between Holochain, which represents the world of crypto technology, and everyday users. The project highlights several innovations that it says will \"enable a large shift in the landscape of crypto applications and currencies,\" including the ability to host P2P apps on the internet for mainstream users.\n\nThe Holo network relies on a series of hosts that provide storage and processing power for DApps built using Holochain. Hosts either install software on their computer that runs in the background and automatically allocates extra processing power to Holochain-based DApps, or they operate a dedicated machine such as a HoloPort. In exchange, hosts are paid in HoloFuel, a token that is specifically designed for microtransactions. The design of HoloFuel is expected to allow the Holo network to process billions of simultaneous transactions.\n\nThe project's business plan centers on building a P2P ecosystem of hosts and applications, comparing its intended effect on app hosting to that of Uber and[ Airbnb](https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/NASDAQ-ABNB/) on the taxi and hotel industries, respectively. Holo charges a fee on HoloFuel transactions, so its revenue model is directly tied to growing the number of applications and hosts on the Networks\n\nThe Holo network acts as a bridge between the centralized internet and Holochain, which does not rely on traditional blockchain technology. As such, it does not rely on global consensus to secure its networks. Rather, each DApp has its own set of validation rules and a local hash chain on which it can store cryptographically signed records. When data is transmitted across multiple nodes, random[ peers](https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/TSE-7066/) act as validators, receiving data and verifying that it follows the correct rules. Validators use a gossip protocol to share good data among one another and warn of bad data or blacklist bad actors.\n\n# Tokenomics\n\nHOT is the ERC20 pre-purchase credit for HoloFuel. HoloFuel is the native currency that powers the Holo hosting network.\n\nHoloFuel will have no supply limit. Rather, it is designed to be dynamic and incorporate a credit system, allowing users to have negative balances. The supply will be controlled algorithmically, contracting and expanding in response to demand and as the relationships between users with negative and positive balances change. Holo intends for this to cause the price of its tokens to remain relatively stable from moment to moment, rather than be subject to wild, speculative price swings.\n\n# Community and Communication\n\nYou can find the most up to date information on [Holo](https://holo.host/) and [Holochain](https://holochain.org/) websites.

The HOT token ERC20 contract was based on Open Zeppelin standards. The only modification made was in removing the ability to burn HOT. The ICO contract was custom, with supply bonded to demand for hardware. That contract was audited by [OneUp](https://www.oneup.company/).\n\n# Market and Trading Data\n\n* HOT Price $0.00857895\n* Market Cap $1,523,904,691\n* Market Cap Dominance 0.09%\n* Trading Volume $111,494,207\n* Volume / Market Cap 0.0734\n* 24h Low / 24h High $0.00814977 / $0.00866097\n* 7d Low / 7d High $0.00838551 / $0.00928570\n* Market Cap Rank #70\n* All-Time High $0.03126682 Apr 05, 2021 (2 months)\n* All-Time Low $0.00022020 Mar 13, 2020 (about 1 year)\n* 1.77B HOT tokens in circulation\n* 1.77B HOT max supply\n* The HOT token is available on major exchanges, including Binance.\n* The 24-hour spot volumes range from $465K (crypto.com) to $20M (Binance).\n\nBenefits to Bancor\n\nLiquidity Pool on Uniswap\n\nhttps://info.uniswap.org/#/tokens/0x6c6ee5e31d828de241282b9606c8e98ea48526e2\n![](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/bancordao/optimized/2X/1/138581db093553159e728d9308dd8531d38023ff_2_602x344.jpeg)\n\nhttps://analytics.sushi.com/pairs/0xb4f3B00d13D20409AfD9488ab991d0b40E6a5219\n\n![](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/bancordao/optimized/2X/6/6564d3f9430031147aa42c3f58d1bd10bb6fa99d_2_602x333.png)\n\nBancor can easily be the biggest pool and preferential DEX to trade HOT.\n\nVoter incentives\n\nThree lucky voters get a HOT t-shirt.

A bag of Syntropy Swag for one lucky winner.\n\nNOIA token address: 0xa8c8CfB141A3bB59FEA1E2ea6B79b5ECBCD7b6ca\n\nProject Website: https://www.syntropynet.com/\n\nProgrammable Networking: https://www.syntropystack.com/\n\n# Project\n\nSyntropy transforms the public internet into a secure and user-centric internet through a unifying layer where encryption and optimized performance are built-in and automatically enabled for anything and everything connected to it. Our technology unlocks greater scalability potential for future technologies and applications. By providing a unifying layer of security and performance across the public internet, a diverse ecosystem of applications can be established on top. Any developer can build on this unifying layer, with compatibility across millions of devices and services, including cloud, on-premise, and edge infrastructure. Syntropy was started and supported by a large, mission-driven community seeking to secure and optimize the Internet for everyone. The core technology is developed and managed by world-class network architects and software engineers, guided by a professional executive team, and supported by more than a dozen close partners, advisors, and activist investors. \n\nSyntropy Onepager: https://www.syntropynet.com/docs/onepager\n\n# Tokenomics\n\nSyntropy is powered by open-source software that enables a decentralized bandwidth sharing economy. The native token represents a standard unit of utility in this economy. The value of a token depends on the network’s bandwidth capacity and its utilization. Routers earn tokens by sharing their bandwidth with customers (i.e. users of the network). The token will be used to create connections between devices or servers, those endpoints will also need tokens to interact with the blockchain. So the more connections and endpoints will be created, more transactions will be on our blockchain and tokens used. Secondly, tokens will be used in staking to provide security for our validators Third, tokens will be used as an exchange of value to pay relay nodes for the optimised traffic they provide. Finally we have a long vision to connect different decentralised infrastructure services together through our decentralised web services platform and the token will be the engine running all blockchain related activities.\n\nSyntropy Tokenomics: https://www.syntropynet.com/docs/tokenomics\n\nSyntropy Staking: https://www.syntropynet.com/docs/staking\n\n# Market and Trading Data\n\n* NOIA’s price at the time of writing is $0.21\n* All-time high: $0.8858 (21th April 2021)\n* All-time low: $0.002947 (16th March, 2020)\n* 368,119,987 NOIA tokens in circulation\n* 1,000,000,000 maximum supply.\n* The current market capitalization is $87,831,216\n* The NOIA token is available on Kucoin, Uniswap, and Nash exchanges.\n* The 24-hour volumes among those exchanges range from $1,192,273 to $10,770,532.\n\n# How White Listing Helps The Bancor Protocol\n\nTop DEX pool is NOIA / ETH on Uniswap with a $1.92m liquidity. A co-investment of 150k BNT creates a pool with 65% of Uniswap’s liquidity from the get go. Syntropy will run a liquidity mining programme to support the Bancor pool thereby attracting existing LPs and increasing their potential APY. We are certain that NOIA / BNT can become the largest DEX pool.\n\nAcquiring users and building a community also relies on some more traditional means and methods. At this point, we are confident about the target user we need to reach, which helps us narrow down on our marketing efforts and makes us more efficient in promoting Bancor pool. Some of our marketing activities include:\n\n1. PR. We've partnered with some leading PR agencies that have experience working with developer and crypto audiences who can definitely help us with promoting Bancor pool as well.\n2. Pay-per-click campaigns. Our research has shown that developer and crypto audiences congregate on Twitter and Reddit, and we will be focusing on these networks for our initial PPC campaigns to promote Bancor listing as well. This will provide us with a constant drip of new users and increase brand awareness.\n3. Content marketing. It is central to our marketing and community building efforts. We will share news about Bancor pool on every social media platform (for example Twitter has 30k members). We are sure that our content will resonate with our audiences.\n\n# Community and Communication\n\nSyntropy is active on [Telegram](https://t.me/SyntropyNet), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Syntropynet), and [Discord](https://discord.gg/HxW6DbUeMn) (Technical Support). The Syntropy team started using Crowdcast for live video AMAs - watch the most recent event [here](https://www.crowdcast.io/e/syntropy-ama).

Needing to replace the entire system adds even more difficulty. That’s why we were adamant from the start that Syntropy be compatible with the world’s current infrastructure. Syntropy Stack pushes this grand vision into reality by allowing developers to build directly on Syntropy. Applications and tools can be easily deployed on top of our unifying layer, eventually supporting all internet-connected devices and data communication protocols. Down below you can see the amount of Syntropy Stack agent downloads during the last two months.\n\n![](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/bancordao/optimized/2X/0/04125c63b6a3cb274df5dd0300e9b6de9c9b5dcc_2_624x405.png)\n\nWe are extensively focusing our resources on business development and global adoption. Former executives [Joe Weinman](https://medium.com/syntropynet/veteran-tech-executive-joins-syntropy-to-drive-awareness-adoption-948ba4323f53), [Shawn Hakl and Roman Pacewicz](https://medium.com/syntropynet/executives-from-tech-giants-join-syntropy-to-scale-global-adoption-44b3ea066131) from tech giants such as AT&T, Microsoft, HP joined Syntropy Advisory Board to scale global adoption earlier this year. Crypto legend [Meltem Demirors](https://medium.com/syntropynet/meltem-demirors-joins-syntropy-to-launch-alliance-for-an-open-internet-fb24508c18ec) also joined the Syntropy Advisory Board to bring mass awareness and adoption of the next-gen internet. In addition to our tech, we’re dedicating $1 million in capital over five years to support and catalyze the new Alliance for an Open Internet. Furthermore, we introduced [Syntropy Builders](https://medium.com/syntropynet/introducing-syntropy-builders-951ee435cb06): a developer-focused initiative to build out the Syntropy ecosystem.

      "content": "[Read the original proposal on Discourse](https://gov.bancor.network/t/proposal-whitelist-gitcoin-gtc-250k-bnt-co-investment/2297)\n\nTLDR;\n\n-   Proposal to Whitelist GTC.\n-   Proposed Co-Investment 250K BNT.\n-   There are no apparent Security Concerns that would prohibit Whitelist Status.\n-   There is no reason to doubt the legitimacy of the Gitcoin (GTC) Team.\n-   The Volume Levels indicate a clear benefit to Bancor.\n-   The Gitcoin Community is made up of veteran open-source Devs. Capturing the attention of their ecosystem could be incredibly helpful for our Grants program and future 3rd party analytics.\n\nContract Address : 0xde30da39c46104798bb5aa3fe8b9e0e1f348163f\n\nProject Website : [Gitcoin.co 1](http://gitcoin.co/)\n\nSecurity / Tokenomics\n\nGTC does not have an elastic Supply, or Re-base Mechanism. At its base layer, GTC is a standard ERC20-style token with a 100mm supply. 50% of the token supply has been allocated to those who have provided value to the ecosystem in the past (community members, investors and the existing team), and 50% will be unlocked for the community to manage in the future. At launch, GitcoinDAO has an even split between past Gitcoin builders and participants, and future ones. The tokens reserved for future builders will be held in treasury, governed by community stewards and then ultimately the DAO. GTC is a fork of the COMP/UNI governance systems, built with a delegation prompt built into the retroactive claim process.\n\n![Community Distribution](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/bancordao/optimized/1X/2ae2cd1499a68f0ec22c9c52e2fad58bb8da9082_2_690x387.png)\n\nAll GTC allocated to Gitcoin's team members are subject to a vesting schedule of at least two years. All GTC allocated to Gitcoin's existing stakeholders are non-transferrable for at least 500 days, or longer if Gitcoin's Board of Directors determines that a longer period is necessary to comply with regulatory or other applicable restrictions.\n\nProject\n\nGTC is the Governance token for the GitcoinDAO allowing for the building and funding of digital public goods. GTC is used to work on decentralized grants, managing disputes, and governing the treasury.\n\n\"GitcoinDAO aims to be the best place to collectively build and fund our digital infrastructure. With our ecosystem partners, we want to help create the biggest and boldest experiments in open source, and and double down on what works. We are:\n\n1.  building a community that cares about public goods\n2.  designing & launching experiments\n3.  supporting & scaling them\n4.  collectively governing them\n\nIn order to facilitate this, we are working with the community to build GitcoinDAO---the decentralized organization building the vessel to the Quadratic Lands: a better world for public goods and digital democracy.\n\nHolders of the token will help guide Gitcoin's direction as we move from a partially centralized Web2.5 platform to a completely decentralized protocol. Our first step is turning over governance of Gitcoin Grants to community stewards, but over time increasingly more decisions will be left entirely in the community's hands.\n\nWant to get involved in governance? Join a workstream [here! 1](https://gitcoin.co/quadraticlands/workstream)\"\n\nCo-Investment Reasoning\n\nAs of right now GTC's Main pools are the Uni V3 and V2 Pools with V3 being the biggest pool at 2M USD TVL. A 250K BNT Co-Investment would allow us to initially overtake the V2 Pool while simultaneously probably cause a decent amount of liquidity to migrate from UNIV3 to Bancor (1.2M USD ~ GTC Space). As we can see from the pictures below GTC's Liquidity to Volume Ratios are quite lucrative particularly due to the very recent launch. This Whitelisting opportunity also brings the Gitcoin Community, which is made up of hardcore open-source devs into our ecosystem.\n\n![Gitcoin (GTC) $5.94](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/bancordao/optimized/1X/c973c2d3974987ca084896f2a6c85a04a40992e7_2_690x279.png)\n\n![$22.03k](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/bancordao/optimized/1X/4af7953783c6499661a17a9c3e9d7137b4bbf83d_2_690x237.png)\n\nCommunity and Communication\n\n[Gitcoin.co/townsquare 2](http://gitcoin.co/townsquare)\n\n[Discord.com](http://discord.com/)\n\n[Twitter](https://twitter.com/gitcoin)\n\n[Reddit](https://reddit.com/r/gitcoincommunity)\n\nMarket and Trading Data\n\n![Gitcoin (GTC)](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/bancordao/optimized/1X/2f64ac742b56f09e5fe57e21386284d0037a43c2_2_690x204.png)\n\n![Screen Shot 2021-05-31 at 8.08.49 PM](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/bancordao/optimized/1X/919ef6bdcea740c8781d5dd4ae280e341681649a_2_690x246.png)",

      "content": "[Read the original proposal on Discourse](https://gov.bancor.network/t/guidelines-for-vote-delegation-on-snapshot-bip12-addendum-2/2307/2)\n\nTL;DR\n=====\n\n-   The updated Snapshot UI supports vote delegation natively.\n-   This document includes instructions, and proposed guidelines for using this feature.\n-   Vote delegation is currently live - allowing community members to nominate other community members to vote on their behalf.\n-   This proposal seeks to permit delegates with an accumulated 25,000 vBNT to submit proposals to [Snapshot 2](http://vote.bancor.network/) for a DAO vote.\n-   Community members are encouraged to nominate themselves as delegates, and a new forum category will be created on Discourse to facilitate discussion and community engagement.\n\n### [](https://gov.bancor.network/t/guidelines-for-vote-delegation-on-snapshot-bip12-addendum-2/2307#voting-instructions-3)Voting Instructions\n\nVote FOR to allow users with 25,000 in delegated voting power to launch proposals on Snapshot.\n\nVote AGAINST to only allow users with 25,000 vBNT staked in the governance contract to launch proposals on Snapshot.\n\n[](https://gov.bancor.network/t/guidelines-for-vote-delegation-on-snapshot-bip12-addendum-2/2307#what-is-vote-delegation-4)What is Vote Delegation?\n===================================================================================================================================================\n\nThe Bancor ecosystem is controlled by its DAO. Users who contribute BNT liquidity receive the vBNT token, which can be staked in a separate contract to participate in DAO operations via voting. Voting is an essential component in maintaining and developing the Bancor project. Managing the insurance whitelist, deciding on protocol co-investments, controlling liquidity incentives, and changing the organization of the DAO are all determined exclusively by community proposals and their voting outcomes.\n\n![](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/bancordao/optimized/1X/5d83f9da0239a5166508764b59c31cc4ee452bbe_2_624x233.png)\n\nThe Bancor DAO is a superheavyweight. The rate of proposals received by the DAO is such that community members have, on average, less than a day to read and consider each one. For committed enthusiasts the burden is easy to manage; however, for some community members the process is prohibitively onerous and time consuming. Moreover, making an informed decision presupposes a level of erudition that some community members feel they do not possess.\n\nVote delegation allows community members to nominate other community members to vote on their behalf. Consider the following hypothetical. Alice and Bob have added 100 BNT each in liquidity to the protocol, and both have received 100 vBNT, which they stake in the governance contract. Alice is a diligent and highly-engaged community member, who actively participates in all governance decisions, whereas Bob is less so. Bob has a lot of respect for Alice and generally believes that their views are well-aligned. Therefore, Bob delegates his vote to Alice, which increases her voting power while offering Bob some relief from the governance process.\n\n![](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/bancordao/optimized/1X/b480b9a01d86df5cdf0d190d53bcb4a72de8347a_2_624x228.png)\n\nImportantly, *Bob does not concede his vBNT; there are no transfers of tokens between Bob and Alice*. Moreover, the process can be reversed at any time. If Alice begins to cease voting, or if Bob no longer agrees with how she votes, he can remove his delegation.\n\n[](https://gov.bancor.network/t/guidelines-for-vote-delegation-on-snapshot-bip12-addendum-2/2307#considerations-5)Considerations\n================================================================================================================================\n\nWith the introduction of vote delegation, there are three main camps of governance participants:\n\n-   Self-representation. These community members are happy reading the proposals in progress, and have a high level of understanding of the Bancor protocol, and its place in the DeFi ecosystem. They are confident in their ability to manage their responsibility to the DAO, and will likely continue to operate in much the same way as they were before the voting delegation was available.\n\n-   Delegators. Community members such as Bob in the example above, are likely to want to delegate their vote to someone else.\n\n-   Delegatees. Community members such as Alice, who are happy to shoulder the responsibility of remaining active in DAO decisions for the foreseeable future.\n\nDelegators do not necessarily need the consent of their chosen representative before transferring their voting power to them. However, it is more conducive to healthy DAO operations to provide a means by which community members can announce their ambition to represent others in governance decisions, advertise their position on certain issues, and their voting philosophy in general. Such a platform allows DAO members to compare and choose their representatives in an informed manner, with the implicit consent of those to whom they may delegate their voting power.\n\nTo this end, a [dedicated category 1](https://gov.bancor.network/c/vote-delegation/21) has been created on the [Bancor Discourse 1](https://gov.bancor.network/) page.This category serves two purposes:\n\n1.  Community members can announce their ambition to represent the voice of others in governance decisions.\n2.  Community members can search for representatives to whom they may consider delegating their voting power.\n\nThere are no stringent rules for how DAO members choose to delegate their voting power, or how community members wish to express their political views and/or campaign for votes to be delegated to them. However, some helpful guidelines are presented here that aim to make the process as open and frictionless as possible.\n\n### [](https://gov.bancor.network/t/guidelines-for-vote-delegation-on-snapshot-bip12-addendum-2/2307#those-seeking-to-delegate-voting-power-to-others-6)Those seeking to delegate voting power to others:\n\nThis category is to serve as a platform for other community members to advertise their willingness to represent others in governance. The threads contained herein will feature DAO member-created material that opines on DAO operations, their personal voting philosophy, and general thoughts on various issues affecting the protocol. From this collection of self-nominated DAO volunteers, you will have access to a range of possible delegates with whom you can discuss your own views to determine the best fit.\n\nIt is recommended that you check the voting habits of your preferred delegate on a semi-regular basis. If you feel they are not representing your personal views, or have failed to participate in the majority of decisions, it may be worth seeking a new delegate to represent you.\n\n### [](https://gov.bancor.network/t/guidelines-for-vote-delegation-on-snapshot-bip12-addendum-2/2307#those-seeking-to-represent-others-in-dao-decisions-7)Those seeking to represent others in DAO decisions:\n\nThis category is a useful platform to announce your willingness to shoulder the responsibility of representing the voice of others. There are no requirements to qualify as a delegate, save for your own self-nomination. Delegate authority is essentially automatic with the creation of a dedicated topic, and the posting of an Ethereum address or ENS domain to which votes should be delegated.\n\nIt is recommended that you maintain your thread regularly. Some inspiration for maintaining a healthy delegate thread is provided here:\n\n-   Describe your general voting philosophy.\n-   Be active in community discussion boards.\n-   Announce ahead of time how you will vote on weekly proposals.\n-   Be available to discuss governance issues on your own thread.\n\n![image](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/bancordao/optimized/1X/a23aa630d95e92ef2e6f7982400f3f60616be684_2_461x500.jpeg)\n\n### [](https://gov.bancor.network/t/guidelines-for-vote-delegation-on-snapshot-bip12-addendum-2/2307#vote-delegation-chains-are-not-supported-8)Vote delegation chains are not supported.\n\nDelegates cannot re-delegate the voting power assigned to them by others. Consider the example presented above. After Bob has delegated his votes to Alice, Alice decides to delegate her voting power to Charlie. Alice can only delegate the voting power associated with her own vBNT stake; the voting power assigned to her by Bob she will remain responsible for, until Bob changes his delegation. Therefore, it is important that delegates announce their withdrawal from DAO operations, and allow sufficient time for those who have assigned voting power to find a new representative.\n\n![](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/bancordao/optimized/1X/0f8ed56ca7a6a5d550e71c485d82ae8ffb9c6c96_2_624x164.png)\n\n### [](https://gov.bancor.network/t/guidelines-for-vote-delegation-on-snapshot-bip12-addendum-2/2307#how-to-delegate-voting-power-9)How to delegate voting power\n\nVote delegation is an on-chain event, and therefore has an associated gas cost.

      "content": "TL;DR\n=====\n\n-   Proposal to increase ICHI co-investment to 350k BNT\n-   Proposal to increase ICHI trading fee to 1%\n\nBackground\n\n[ICHI was whitelisted on April 26th, 2021 3](https://vote.bancor.network/#/bancornetwork.eth/proposal/Qmc1xBSwD4h2wLEQ5RhKSBUNmXQehirYfA9Vvk4xR6kaNA) with an overwhelming response of 51% quorum and 97.41% for votes. On May 27th, 2021, ICHI announced ICHI V2, featuring a [Decentralized Monetary Authority 1](https://medium.com/ichifarm/announcing-ichi-v2-d69cebc47d25) with audits by Quantstamp and Solidified. ICHI V2 will launch mid-June. ICHI plans to create and bootstrap a oneBNT (stablecoin minted with BNT) for the Bancor community as soon as Bancor announces the availability of shadow tokens.\n\nJustification\n\nICHI coinvestment started at 20k BNT. This was filled on the same day and resulted in a 5X increase in Bancor liquidity. However, the ICHI pools on Sushiswap, 1INCH, and Balancer are still 5-10X larger than the pool on Bancor. The difference in TVL means that most trading volume still routes through these other exchanges. The following two actions will improve the profitability and trading volume of the Bancor pool:\n\n-   Increasing ICHI co-investment to 350k BNT. More ICHI will be added and the TVL will increase to be on par with the other exchanges.\n-   Increasing the trading fee to 1%. Other smaller cap pools are getting great APYs with fees closer to 1%.\n\nThis actions should result in most ICHI liquidity being on Bancor. The math: (350k * 4.8 BNT)/.5 = $3.3M in liquidity versus ~$7M on other AMMs ($3.9M Sushiswap). The increase in ICHI incentives: the increase in Bancor liquidity will result in ~1/3 of ICHI liquidity incentives routing to dual-sided Bancor LPs (and single-sided once supported) with the next ICHI weekly adjustment. This is expected to provide an additional boost that brings 50+% of ICHI liquidity to Bancor.\n\nGovernance Participation Reward\n\n40 xICHI (staked ICHI eligible for Ichipowah voting and ICHI governance rewards) will be granted to each 'Yes' or 'No' voter who meets either of the following eligibility criteria:\n\n-   All voters who voted [on ICHI's last proposal 3](https://vote.bancor.network/#/bancornetwork.eth/proposal/Qmc1xBSwD4h2wLEQ5RhKSBUNmXQehirYfA9Vvk4xR6kaNA) and have not un-staked the 20 xICHI reward for voting on that proposal. These voters represent ~98% of the vBNT that voted on the last proposal.\n-   The top 50 (vBNT descending) voters who did not vote on ICHI's last proposal and vote on this proposal with at least 50 vBNT",

Security and balancing concerns were expressed as well.\n-   The *Introduction*, *Comments*, and *Conclusions* sections present the initial analysis before the last rounds of high DAO vote participation. The *Discussion* section collects the thoughts of the DAO in the governance forum to make them available on snapshot for an informed vote [3]. An update of the proposal is shown in the discussion.\n-   The latest voting rounds with high participation were considered in the analysis that derived the final proposed requirements for quorum and supermajority.\n-   The proposed requirement changes are the following*:\n\n> 1.  Whitelisting proposals: 35% quorum, 66.7% supermajority.\n> 2.  Co-investments < 1M BNT: 35% quorum, 66.7% supermajority.\n> 3.  Co-investments > 1M BNT: 40% quorum, 66.7% supermajority.\n> 4.

Governance and protocol changes: 35% quorum, 66.7% supermajority.\n\n*These are shown again under the *FOR* section.\n\n[](https://gov.bancor.network/t/proposal-update-quorum-and-supermajority-requirements/2115#introduction-4)Introduction\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe last proposals to whitelist tokens on snapshot have failed despite adequate engagement from voters. An improvement to the voting system is long overdue. Voting data on snapshot for all the wallets with vBNT currently staked in governance was collected [1]. With this data, an analysis of the current voter demographic was drawn to hopefully shed some light into the current voting issues to find adequate solutions for them.\n\n![image](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/bancordao/original/1X/1c4fc6759ad2be3df52969b34095a9da42d09e03.png)\n\n![image](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/bancordao/original/1X/16a7a54d080668ab231afd29505e7b8d6461a3fc.png)\n\nFigure 1 - Active Voters and Voting participation\n\n[](https://gov.bancor.network/t/proposal-update-quorum-and-supermajority-requirements/2115#comments-5)Comments\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1.  A vBNT staker in governance was considered an active voter if their corresponding wallet has cast at least one vote since the snapshot is active.\n2.  Voter participation was calculated as votes divided by total proposals.\n3.  Voter participation was taken from the moment a first vote was cast.\n4.  Some inactive voters might have staked vBNT without a chance to vote yet. This fact is further emphasized by the number of \"Active but haven't voted for 1 week\" stakers.\n5.  \"Active voters that haven't staked in x weeks\" stabilises around 3 weeks.\n6.  Average Active vote participation is 30%.\n7.  A substantial amount of vBNT stakers vote on less than 10% of the proposals.\n8.  There is a significant number of wallets with less than 10 vBNT staked in governance (Figure 1).\n\n[](https://gov.bancor.network/t/proposal-update-quorum-and-supermajority-requirements/2115#conclusions-6)Conclusions\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n-   A debate on the topic was already done and no conclusion came from it [2]. This proposal aims to bring two concrete ones and hopefully spark some debate.\n-   As a side note, in the future, a minimum vBNT stake in governance should be added to avoid wallets staking small amounts in order to get any community incentive that is given as a part of voting (88mph and ZCN are two examples of this) without contributing to quorum (Point 8).\n-   A solution to reduce the impact of whales on quorum is to change the vBNT voting power structure. A reduction to the voting power of larger vBNT stakers vs smaller ones could be considered, to level down the voting power of whales. The solution is non-trivial to implement and might incentivise bigger wallets to split their stake into smaller ones to acquire more voting power, especially if gas fees are lowered with coming L2s. Another solution is quadratic voting -- however, it brings unnecessary complexity to snapshot. The idea is interesting and should be explored if easier solutions are not enough.\n-   A recursive vote on snapshot to check inactivity for addresses that have not voted for the past 3 weeks (point 5). Addresses that do not cast a vote on the inactive check are then removed from quorum until they cast a vote or a vBNT restake is made (whichever is simpler to implement really). The tactic can also help reduce the number of active voters with low participation (point 7). The number of inactive wallets holding the most vBNT staked in governance is sufficiently high to consider this as well.\n-   Quorum on whitelisting proposals can and should be lowered to 30% given the average active voter participation (point 6).\n-   I believe the last two solutions are simple enough. The simplicity of the solutions will reduce dev time while hopefully hindering the current voting issues. A more advanced solution was suggested by [@tenzent](https://gov.bancor.network/u/tenzent) [2] and should also be considered:\n\n> Supermajority Rule : Whitelisting proposals are still 40% Quorum but, having a supermajority of 80% (FOR) lowers it to 30% for whitelisting proposals. This will counter tactical voting since in order to beat the super majority they would have to vote against rather than abstain. 30% Seems like a good number because it is not incredibly easy to reach but in proposals like LPL the community, with the help of only a few mid-size whales, has been able to achieve it (The biggest one being xBNT which we can count on for consistent and reliable voting). This rule would essentially mean that overwhelming support for tokens will be treated differently than split decisions.\n\n[](https://gov.bancor.network/t/proposal-update-quorum-and-supermajority-requirements/2115#discussion-7)Discussion\n==================================================================================================================\n\nAfter some debate since it was posted, I believe most voters agree with [@mbr](https://gov.bancor.network/u/mbr) 's thorough proposal.\n\n> ### 1\\. All Whitelisting Proposals Include a Maximum 20k BNT Co-Investment, Subject to a 30% Quorum and 80% Supermajority Requirement.\n>\n> There are good reasons for this. The lower quorum requirement makes it easier for an individual, or small group of individuals to pass a proposal. The system's vulnerability is increased, and the DAO needs to maintain its ability to manage pool sizes. It is not the case that a deliberate attack is necessarily the most pertinent threat - highly enthusiastic communities, and even our own community, can achieve the same damage without any nefarious intent. A hard limit of 20k co-invested BNT immediately following a whitelist proposal forces these new additions to be managed more carefully.\n>\n> ### 2\\. Co-investment Increases are Subject to Dynamic Quorum and Supermajority Requirements.\n>\n> At present, co-investment increases are held to a 20% quorum and 66.7% supermajority requirement, regardless of the co-investment being requested. The low quorum is partly a reflection of the difficulty in whitelisting. If whitelisting pools is made easier, it stands to reason that increasing co-investment limits ought to be harder; the reduced barrier to entry must be commensurate with strengthened security later in the pool's lifecycle.\n>\n> 1.  Co-investment increases up to and including 100k BNT are subject to 30% quorum and 80% supermajority.\n> 2.  Co-investment increases over 100k BNT are subject to 40% quorum and 66.7% supermajority.\n>\n> ### 3\\. Future Revisions to Whitelisting and Co-Investment Policy is Subject to a 30% Quorum and 80% Supermajority Requirement.\n>\n> It is conspicuous that it is easier to change whitelisting policy, than passing a whitelist proposal. Strictly speaking, this is a type of governance hack. For example, consider that an antagonist who wishes to pass a toxic token has a reduced path to acceptance by first changing the whitelisting policy. This is not acceptable, and we have an opportunity here to close this apparent loophole.\n>\n> I also want to address some of the user feedback, as well as the conversation that was hosted on our community call recently. We are absolutely committed to making Bancor the DAO to which all others are compared. This will require a comparable level of innovation as the product itself, and will be prioritized after the development pipeline is less congested. The main pain points are whale control and voter apathy - and I am working on a model to deal with both simultaneously. Rest assured that I \n\n[Read the FULL proposal on Discourse](https://gov.bancor.network/t/proposal-update-quorum-and-supermajority-requirements/2115)",

      "content": "TL;DR\n1. The LM rewards structure on the stablecoin pools is proposed to be changed. The rewards emissions are halved, from 50k to 25k BNT per week\n2. The distribution of the rewards remains the same (70% to the BNT side, 30% to TKN side)\n3. The change is being made in order to gradually decrease rewards on pools with stable tokens.\n4. The change is now possible, due to low gas cost.\n\nDiscussion\nDue to Bancor V2.1 single asset exposure and IL protection, and because the stable pools do not appreciate with the rest of the market, the current APY on the TKN side of the stable pools is unsustainably high.\n\n1. The 3 stablecoin pools currently have around 15M stable assets each locked on the TKN side, which is entitled to 30,000 BNTs a month each (if 2x multiplier applied), providing around 50% APY on TKN and 70% on the BNT side.\n2. The emissions change would reduce APY to around 20-30% on TKN and around 35-40% on BNT side (all else held equal).\n3. The above APY is still among the most profitable, risk-minimised staking yield for stable assets in DeFi on the Ehtereum network.\n4. The reason for the change is stablecoin pools incur a higher than normal impermanent loss cost on the network due to the inherent divergence between the price of USD and BNT.\n5. The change is being made in anticipation of a Bancor V3.\n6. Until the new solution is live, we anticipate the gradual reduction of rewards will not cause significant outflow of capital and will decrease the emission of BNT tokens by 600K BNT, monthly.\n\n\nLiquidity mining halving and rewards re-distribution:\n\nProposing halving LM rewards on stable pools.\nInstead of 50,000 BNTs per week, 25,000 BNTs per week will be distributed to each pool (2x more if considering multiplier logic)\nPools considered for 30 days extension and rewards halving:\n\n* DAI\n* USDC\n* USDT\n\nThe Alternative is Not Economically Sound\n\nThe alternative approach would be to increase the investment caps on stable tokens; however:\n* Stablecoin pools are, at present, the single greatest cost to the protocol in terms of IL expenses. Increasing the caps would only exacerbate the problem.\n* Decreasing the emissions gradually over time poses high gas costs to the network in terms of contract upgrades.\n\nSummary\n\n* Bancor should not lose the momentum and cut out the LM rewards on stablecoins.\n* Considering the change in the rewards redistribution, the APY should still be maintained on a highly competitive level.\n* The new solution for stable tokens is around the corner. Therefore, the maintenance of stablecoin liquidity incentives is a temporary problem.",

The TRU token supply is fixed at 1,450,000,000, of which 239,842,417 are in current circulation. Some tokens have been burned so in fact the total supply is now 1,442,485,442.37835615.\n\nThe contracts and addresses with the highest concentration of TRU tokens are predominantly unallocated community incentives, the token vesting contracts, two of the team's wallets, and Binance.

Users are able to lend stablecoins (for now just TUSD, but shortly USDC and other tokens) to TrueFi and earn a 10%+ yield on their deposits. Borrowers are diligenced and approved by governance to be able to borrow without collateral requirements. TrueFi will also be launching an on-chain credit score that other protocols will be able to utilize in an effort to improve credit efficiency throughout DeFi.\n\n[](https://gov.bancor.network/t/proposal-whitelist-truefi-tru-plus-250k-bnt-co-investment-attempt-2/2263#tokenonmics-5)Tokenonmics\n==================================================================================================================================\n\nTrueFi's token, TRU is used for both governance and staking on the platform. TRU stakers deposit TRU into the protocol's staking contract and are credited with stkTRU (currently, about 30% of circulating supply is being staked) which can be used for governance and approving loans. In the case of a default, stakers stand to lose a portion of their staked TRU. Stakers are also entitled to all fees generated by the protocol.\n\n[](https://gov.bancor.network/t/proposal-whitelist-truefi-tru-plus-250k-bnt-co-investment-attempt-2/2263#community-and-communication-6)Community and Communication\n==================================================================================================================================================================\n\nTrueFi is active on [Twitter ](https://twitter.com/TrustToken), [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/3tMyMqyqDj), and [Telegram](https://t.me/jointruefi).\n\n[](https://gov.bancor.network/t/proposal-whitelist-truefi-tru-plus-250k-bnt-co-investment-attempt-2/2263#available-audits-7)Available Audits\n============================================================================================================================================\n\nAll audits can be found publicly on our [Github page](https://github.com/trusttoken/audits/tree/master/TrueFi).\n\n[](https://gov.bancor.network/t/proposal-whitelist-truefi-tru-plus-250k-bnt-co-investment-attempt-2/2263#market-and-trading-data-8)Market and Trading Data\n==========================================================================================================================================================\n\n-   ATH was $0.615301 (Feb 13, 2021)\n-   ATL was $0.108493 (Nov 26, 2020)\n-   Max supply of 1,442,485,442.37835615\n-   TRU is available on SushiSwap and Uniswap\n-   [Coingecko](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/truefi)",

Their aims include lowering the barrier to entry to staking on Chainlink nodes, easing the amount of technical experience required to run a Chainlink node, and providing smart contract creators with the tools to easily search and identify Chainlink nodes that can suit their data requirements. LinkPool achieves these goals by offering an easy to use and intuitive staking dApp, providing node infrastructure through their eventual [Node as a Service (NaaS)](https://medium.com/linkpool/announcing-node-as-a-service-2034ee42d2d9) [2] and [managed node offerings](https://linkpool.io/#service-slides/3) [3], and their industry first [Chainlink Market ](https://market.link/)[4], the definitive listing service and search engine for the Chainlink network. They have also developed [powerful, trustless contracts](https://medium.com/linkpool/creating-trustless-pools-and-staking-for-all-266451277e3f) [5] that can fairly distribute any form of revenue between a set of wallets.\n\nThe project was born thanks to two Chainlink community members ([Jonny Huxtable](https://twitter.com/HuxtableJonny) [6] and Mat Beale) who started talking through the now defunct Chainlink Slack channel and realized that [Chainlink staking 1](https://medium.com/linkpool/staking-with-chainlink-b58eb3de6f1b) [7] was not going to be easy for the average Joe, due to the fact that it is much more difficult to manage a Chainlink oracle than to manage a PoS or PoW blockchain node. So they decided to [come up with a project ](https://s3.linkpool.io/LinkPool+Whitepaper.pdf)[8] that would allow users to deposit LINK collateral on the [LinkPool node](https://etherscan.io/address/0x240bae5a27233fd3ac5440b5a598467725f7d1cd) [9] in a secure and decentralized way so that users could experience the benefits of staking, without having to be exposed to most of the risks involved.\n\nBetween April 15, 2018 and July 31, 2018 LinkPool opened a crowdsale to raise funds in which they offered 25% of their company for sale in the form of 1000 tokenized shares in exchange for 1000 ETH. Thanks to said crowdsale they managed to raise ~705 ETH, however [they decided to proportionally distribute](https://medium.com/linkpool/crowdsale-completion-unsold-portion-distribution-and-token-transfers-dd226d06acad) [10] the \"unsold\" portion among those who had contributed ETH to the crowdsale.\n\nA lot has changed since then: on March 26, 2021, [LinkPool announced that they had redesigned both their token and their platform](https://medium.com/linkpool/staking-app-v2-and-token-migration-9b3d1672cd45) [11]. Among various reasons (listed below), this was done because [the original LinkPool token (LP)'s contract](https://etherscan.io/address/0x182d4990bb0ff595b308b3efcb93313abad575e7) [12] had integrated a biweekly airdrop mechanism that did not conform to the ERC-20 token standard. The original token also presented additional problems:\n\n-   Lack of visibility within the DeFi ecosystem\n-   Lack of liquidity: there used to be [a very feature-limited DEX](https://staking.linkpool.io/dex) [13] as the only way to acquire LinkPool tokens.\n-   Significant barrier to entry (a minimum of 0.04 LP with forced 0.04 increments)\n-   Lack of transparency: unless you were very familiar with reading and understanding Ethereum transactions, hashes, input data and block explorers, it was quite complex to know what was happening on-chain.\n-   Lack of DeFi composability: [per Jonny Huxtable](https://medium.com/linkpool/staking-app-v2-and-token-migration-9b3d1672cd45) [11], \"the importance of composability became dramatically apparent. That's why we've since rebuilt the token and platform from the ground up to provide a staking ecosystem that's not just for us but the entire Chainlink node ecosystem across multiple blockchain networks in a fully composable manner.\"\n\n[](https://gov.bancor.network/t/proposal-whitelist-linkpool-lpl-plus-250k-bnt-co-investment-limit-attempt-3/2265#tokenomics-6)Tokenomics\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe LPL token supply is fixed at 100,000,000, of which at least [25,000,000 are currently available to the general public (see: Distribution) ](https://talk.linkpool.io/t/what-are-linkpool-tokens-how-did-everything-start/27)[14]. [According to on-chain data ](https://etherscan.io/token/0x89B641464E82697ADfc6CCcbF52b93a89B791E1F#balances)[15], at least 71,450,000 LPL are currently owned and staked by LinkPool at time of posting (based on a rate of 1 linkLPLA to 1 LPL staked). 15 LP (375,000 LPL) are owned as severance by former Head of Operations and co-founder Mat Beale. [These particular tokens are fully locked until September 1, 2021](https://talk.linkpool.io/t/linkpool-operational-update/77) [16]. Some of the available supply is still dependent upon holders of the previous token migrating to the ERC-20 token. At time of posting, [3960.08 out of 4000 LP have been migrated ](https://app.linkpool.io/migrate)[17] to LPL (at the rate of 1 LP to 25,000 LPL, this is 99,002,000 LPL).\n\nThe contract with the highest concentration of LinkPool tokens is the [LinkPool Owners' Pool](https://app.linkpool.io/pools/linkpool-owners/info) [18] (the Staking Contract); at time of post this is [around 97,000,000](https://etherscan.io/address/0x0aA3d1c7838e20790A196d56899fE0Bc8B23700F) [19]. At time of writing, the BNT-LPL pool is the [fourth largest ](https://etherscan.io/token/0x99295f1141d58a99e939f7be6bbe734916a875b8#balances)[20].\n\n[Read the original proposal on Discourse](https://gov.bancor.network/t/proposal-whitelist-opium-token-with-150k-bnt-co-investment/2108/2)",

It makes staked ETH liquid and allows participation with any amount of ETH.\n\nWhen using Lido to stake your ETH on the Ethereum beacon chain, users will receive a token (stETH), which represents their ETH on the Ethereum beacon chain on a 1:1 basis. It effectively acts as a bridge bringing ETH 2.0's staking rewards to ETH 1.0.\n\nAs a user's staked ETH generates staking rewards from ETH 2.0, the user's ETH balance on the beacon chain will increase. stETH balances will update correspondingly once per day allowing you to access on ETH 1.0 the value of your staking rewards received on ETH 2.0.\n\nUsers can use stETH in all of the same ways that they can use ETH: sell it, spend it and, since it is compatible to be used in DeFi, use it as collateral for on-chain lending. When transactions are enabled on ETH 2.0, users can also redeem stETH for ETH.\n\n[](https://gov.bancor.network/t/proposal-whitelist-lido-dao-token-ldo-plus-500k-bnt-co-investment-limit-attempt-2/2264#tokenomics-7)Tokenomics\n==============================================================================================================================================\n\nThe LDO token is the [governance token](https://blog.lido.fi/introducing-ldo/) for Lido DAO.

The Bancor community was lax and the failure of these proposals caught them by surprise. We have seen a large amount (1.5m and counting) of vBNT stakes in governance since they failed. It is clear that the community wants to vote on this proposal again and there's reason to believe this proposal might pass now.\n\n[](https://gov.bancor.network/t/proposal-extend-lm-rewards-on-link-pool-for-12-weeks-attempt-2/2238#contract-complexity-means-we-must-act-now-6)Contract Complexity Means We Must Act Now\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n-   Due to the design of the liquidity mining contracts, it is very difficult, bordering on impossible, to change the amount or duration of LM rewards once they have been assigned to a pool.\n\n-   For this reason, we have an all-or-nothing decision in front of us even though it may be more desirable to choose some middle ground.\n\n-   Due to the design of the contracts, it is very difficult to *reinstate* LM rewards once they have lapsed. The YFI pool, for example, had LM rewards renewed a month ago which are still not active due to the heavy lifting required by the Bancor team.\n\n-   This means that if we do not renew these LM rewards immediately, we will not get them back for weeks and perhaps ever once V3 launches.\n\n-   This decision is urgent and requires an appropriate amount of our attention.\n\n[](https://gov.bancor.network/t/proposal-extend-lm-rewards-on-link-pool-for-12-weeks-attempt-2/2238#bancor-v3-business-positioning-and-pool-competitiveness-7)Bancor V3, Business Positioning and Pool Competitiveness\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAccording to Bancor's team recent announcement:\n\n-   Bancor V3 will be Bancor's largest and most significant upgrade to the protocol.\n\n-   V3 incorporates community feedback in the past 8 months since v2.1 went live and leverages a brand new discovery in the core AMM design that will dramatically improve the protocol's capital efficiency while reducing friction and costs for users.\n\n-   V3 unlocks a new way for passive LPs to earn even higher yields on their staked capital while being fully protected against IL. Just set, forget and earn high APRs, with no risk of IL.\n\n-   The new design will encourage more liquidity to flow into the protocol, and vastly more volume to be processed, driving sustainably high yields for Bancor LPs, and allowing the protocol to collect more revenue.\n\n-   V3 lays the foundation for Bancor to capture a much larger share of total crypto liquidity and trading revenue.\n\nBancor is on the cusp of V3. Every indication that we have says that this new version will be a massive change to the ecosystem. Meanwhile, we have seen the protocol continue to build TVL, trading volume, and general momentum on the back of LM rewards.\n\nRemoving LM rewards at this time is highly disruptive and flies in the face of every principal of [change management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Change_management). It is a change made without understanding what V3 will bring and will put Bancor's users through two significant disruptions in a short period of time. Total protocol changes like V3 should be made during periods of stability, not during the turmoil that would occur in this case.\n\nSome comments:\n\n1.  The protocol is still in a growth phase, both in TVL but especially in volume (Figure 1), since Bancor v2.1 was released.\n\n2.  LINK pool has seen an average APR of 1.76% (past 60 days), gathering $1,133,448.47 worth of fees in the past 30 days (Figure 2). To remain competitive with other protocols, LM rewards are necessary to incentivise LINK liquidity to remain staked before Bancor v3 arrives.\n\n![image](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/bancordao/original/1X/a79540e1c0ec3e358c4323b5fe1f663586b91ccc.png)\\\nFigure 1.

At this stage, LM rewards on these primary pools (ETH, wBTC, LINK, stablecoins) are allowing Bancor to stay competitive and exceed the yields offered by competitors. Swap APYs, as they exist now, are probably not enough to draw the depth of liquidity we need.\n\n2.  7,894,347 BNT LM rewards have been claimed from 2,557 unique addresses. Given a total current BNT supply of 204,096,941 (supply is elastic), these represent 3.87% of total supply.\n\n3.  20,909,923 BNT LM rewards have been re-staked from 2,095 unique addresses, far outweighing the claimed BNT.\n\n4.  A large majority of the LM rewards are re-staked to the protocol, increasing the TVL and the space available for TKN deposits with single sided exposure. If this trend continues, the LM program is more of an asset than a liability, and can be managed more assertively.\n\n5.  Inflation is a complex phenomenon and simply increasing the amount of BNT tokens does not necessarily lead to inflation. And, regardless of the amount of inflation that is occurring, we don't have enough information to say that our increased TVL, decreased slippage, and attractiveness to aggregators is not worth that inflation.\n\n[](https://gov.bancor.network/t/proposal-extend-lm-rewards-on-link-pool-for-12-weeks-attempt-2/2238#conclusionscomments-9)Conclusions/Comments\n==============================================================================================================================================\n\n[Continue reading on Discourse](https://gov.bancor.network/t/proposal-extend-lm-rewards-on-link-pool-for-12-weeks-attempt-2/2238)\n",

In order for a user to find the best price for a swap, they need to look at every exchange --- DEX aggregators eliminate the need for manually checking, bringing efficiency to swapping on DEXs.\n\nDEX aggregators work by sourcing liquidity from different DEXes, meaning that they are able to offer users better token swap rates than they could find on any single DEX, in the shortest time possible.\n\n1inch launched in August 2020 after a $2.8 million funding raise from Binance Labs, Galaxy Digital, Greenfield One, Libertus Capital, Dragonfly Capital, FTX, IOSG, LAUNCHub Ventures and Divergence Ventures.\n\nIn December 2020, 1inch raised another $12 million in Series A funding, led by Pantera Capital, with others including ParaFi Capital, Blockchain Capital, Nima Capital and Spartan Group. The funding round was conducted through a SAFT sale (simple agreement for future tokens).\n\nIn December 2020, 1inch launched its 1INCH governance token, and the 1inch Network began to be governed by a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO).\n\n[](https://gov.bancor.network/t/proposal-whitelist-1inch-with-200k-bnt-coinvestment/2163#tokenomics-6)Tokenomics\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe 1inch token launch was announced in August 2020. [According to ](https://www.theblockcrypto.com/post/86401/dex-aggregator-1inch-raises-12-million-saft-sale)Kunz, \"the 1INCH tokens are not intended to be securities [...] or an investment. The 1INCH tokens are intended to be used for their consumptive purposes on the 1inch Network, the 1INCH token protocols, and other applications that third parties may develop utilizing the 1INCH tokens and/or the permissionless blockchain-based decentralized 1inch Network.\"\n\nThe 1inch token is used to stake and participate in the governance of 1inch protocols by all holders.\n\nThe circulating supply on 1inch as of its release day on Dec. 25, 2020 is 6 percent of the total issuance, as well as .5 percent for the first two weeks of the liquidity mining program. The current total supply of 1INCH is 1.5 billion tokens.\n\nOf the total token supply, 30 percent was allocated to community incentives, and they will be passed out over the next four years in order to create an incentive for community members to be involved in protocol governance.\n\nOver a four-year period as well, 14.5 percent of the total supply will make up the protocol growth and development fund, used to issue grants, bring on developers and repay any users due to unforeseen circumstances.\n\n[](https://gov.bancor.network/t/proposal-whitelist-1inch-with-200k-bnt-coinvestment/2163#community-and-communication-7)Community and Communication\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1INCH is active on [Reddit ](https://www.reddit.com/r/1inch/), [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/FZADkCZ) and [Telegram](https://t.me/OneInchNetwork).

      "content": "[Read the original proposal on Discourse](https://gov.bancor.network/t/bip-increase-vortex-burner-to-20-active-immediately/2166)\n\nTLDR: Increase the vortex burn to 20% while LM rewards are active. Reduce it when they expire.\n\nA quorum of 20% and a 66% majority will decide the results. Be aware of the above dates and lock your vBNT in time if you wish to participate.\n\nA brief timeline of the vortex.\\\nThe initial proposal BIP9-proposing-the-bancor-vortex proposed a Vortex burn with dynamic fees. See chart below.\n\n![image](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/bancordao/optimized/1X/41c9018531650cea6b92be98c32ba2452b2393ab_2_690x364.png)\n\nUpon code design of the initial Vortex - Bancor devs made it clear to the community that a dynamic burn would take significant amount of dev resources - an easier alternative would be to create a fixed burn instead. ([BIP9-Flat-Fee 4](https://gov.bancor.network/t/bip9-addendum-the-bancor-vortex-vbnt-burner-proposal-to-switch-to-a-flat-burn-rate/1015/2))\n\nThe new proposal was initiated to switch to a flat burn, mandating a 5% initial burn with increases every 6 months for 18 months - quoted directly from the article \"The fee is increased every 6 months in 5% increments for 18 months\"\\\nAn increase of 5% at the 6th, 12th, and 18th month would lead to a burn of 20% at the end of 18 months. It's unclear why the writer's math calculated 3 increases of 5% to result in an ending 15% burn.\n\nSince inception of the Vortex - the vBNT/BNT ratio has steadily plummeted. This could be due to a variety of reasons - although the specific reason doesn't matter - very small pool size, a wave of leveraged demand that was previously unsatisfied, and high liquidity mining rewards attracts users to heavily leverage their positions repetitively through the Vortex are a few.\\\nAfter 4 months since the inception - the Vortex vBNT price has steadily found it's home around the 0.2-0.3 range.\n\nReferencing Table 1 from above - The Vortex with a price at 0.2-0.3 should be burning in the range 20-30% if under the dynamic burn structure.\n\nGiven the fact that the majority of Bancor Liquidity Pools are distributing 70-80% annualized LM rewards, plus swap fees - Burning 5% of fees is just simply too low. The Liquidity mining rewards are 15x as lucrative on their own.\\\nThe market just saw a significant downturn over recent weeks - many tokens saw dips of over 75% in a two week period. The strength of the Bancor ecosystem relies on permanent liquidity locked within it's pools. As the network generates significant inflationary BNT rewards to attract liquidity providers - we must focus our efforts NOW to ensure long run success by locking up as much liquidity as possible.\n\nIncreasing the burn rate will have a natural upward push on the price of vBNT - which ALL owners of BNT will benefit from. The higher the rate of the burn>>higher vBNT price >> cheaper leverage for users that want to leverage their vBNT. This in conjunction with the increase in amounts burned - entices more users to participate in the vortex and increases the total TVL significantly.\n\nIt is important to consider the two main selling points of Bancor:\n\n1.  Impermanent loss insurance - no other protocol allows users to provide liquidity with 100% protection against impermanent loss.\n\n2.  Single sided liquidity - no other protocol allows users to remain exposed entirely to their favorite crypto asset while earning trade fees at the same time.\n\nThese two points are significant steps in democratizing AMM services and are the true highlights of Bancor. As members of the Bancor community we all need to do a better job of highlighting these two key aspects of the network. As it stands, there's just simply no way a liquidity provider could complain about the vortex fee given the benefits that Bancor offers them.\n\nIncreases in the vortex fee to this extent will go unnoticed as power users continue to be rewarded by the DAO with significant liquidity mining rewards and/or benefit from Bancor's unique and world class design. The increased fee will also create a pathway to an eventual increase in size of the vBNT pool - allowing more users to be able to earn yield on their vBNT.\n\nImplementation of the new fees can be done in a matter of minutes.\\\n[Screenshot of Yudi Confirming this 20](https://gyazo.com/3262d47905b14c47fa8c67be1d7642b9)\n\nInstructions:\n\nVote FOR to:\n\n1.

      "content": "[Read the original proposal on Discourse](https://gov.bancor.network/t/bip-increase-vortex-burner-to-10/2202)\n\nIntroduction\n------------\n\nA discussion was started in [(BIP) Increase Vortex Burner to 20% - Active Immediately](https://gov.bancor.network/t/bip-increase-vortex-burner-to-20-active-immediately/2166/1) to debate an increase in the Vorter Burner to 20%. Fair points and analysis from several DAO members were made about, among others, vBNT/BNT rate, vBNT leverage interest, total BNT locked in the protocol, APRs from swap fees and APY from LM rewards, current volume growth and overall health of the protocol.\n\nI've included my discussion points, updated after [@BurnVictim](https://gov.bancor.network/u/burnvictim) pointed out that the date to increase the vBNT burn to 10% was counted from the moment the Vortex Burner was live.\n\nI was informed that an agreement was made with [@BurnVictim](https://gov.bancor.network/u/burnvictim) to increase the vBNT burn rate to 10% for now.\n\n[](https://gov.bancor.network/t/bip-increase-vortex-burner-to-10/2202#discussion-4)Discussion\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTrying to methodically and impartially analyse a proposal to potentially increase the current vBNT burn.\n\n### [](https://gov.bancor.network/t/bip-increase-vortex-burner-to-10/2202#projected-volume-5)Projected volume\n\nvBNT burnt is directly proportional to the protocol volume. I've calculated the projected protocol volume from April 2021 vs May 2021, using monthly volume data since December 2021, when it started rising fairly linearly. With this data, we can assess how close we are to the \"goal volume\" when the vBNT burn rate would be increased to 10% and interpolate from the 5% burn in April to obtain a \"fair\" burn rate. The vortex was activated on the 2nd of February so that date would fall in the beginning of August.\n\n![image](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/bancordao/original/1X/e76e6875a6f517c21142370dfdf7b7234ecf2d31.png)\nFigure 1 - Projected volume from April 2021 and May 2021.\n\nAssuming a linear growth in volume, we're right at the volume where a vBNT burnt to 10% would be implemented. If the vBNT burn rate were to linearly scale with volume, a fair value for it would be 10.11%.\n\n### [](https://gov.bancor.network/t/bip-increase-vortex-burner-to-10/2202#average-apr-6)Average APR\n\nOne could instead debate that vBNT burn should be analysed against average protocol APR, as to keep it *at least* steady or slightly increasing. Liquidity-weighted average of the weekly APR of top pools (54% of liquidity on the last day of the week) one week after the vBNT burn started was 4.68%, at a 5% vBNT burn rate. Current liquidity-weighted average of the weekly APR of top pools (41% of liquidity) is 13.58%. If the vBNT burn rate was 10%, this value would be 12.86%; at 15% it would be 12.15%; and at 20% it would be 11.44%.\n\n![image](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/bancordao/original/1X/2c6b1691ef5991cc83d6906da5551b8e12f1e9db.png)\n\n![image](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/bancordao/original/1X/6da47ede450e7a70a168810e198b46a7a2645546.png)\n\nFigure 2 - Liquidity-weighted average APRs for the top pools with data available on Dune Analytics.\n\n### [](https://gov.bancor.network/t/bip-increase-vortex-burner-to-10/2202#dynamic-fee-structure-7)Dynamic fee structure\n\n-   Based on the variable swap fee (Table 1), at a vBNT price of 0.2-0.3 BNT, the average swap fee to burn vBNT should be between 21.1% to 32.2%.\n-   However, since this discussion was started, the price of vBNT has risen to 0.509 BNT, at which the average swap fee should be 10.7%.\n-   The recent increase in vBNT price demonstrates how volatile it can be given enough speculation. vBNT liquidity in the vBNT/BNT pool is only at 1,952,634 vBNT, 3.13% of total vBNT supply.\n-   The initially proposed variable fee structure is dynamic and would adjust the burn fees automatically and autonomously. Unfortunately, with a fixed burn schedule, we don't benefit from such advantages. The burn fees should be set based on the current and expected vBNT price before the next adjustment. However, such a prediction is impossible to make. Hence, we should tread lightly, and increase the vBNT burn rate in a controlled way.\n\n![image](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/bancordao/optimized/1X/41c9018531650cea6b92be98c32ba2452b2393ab_2_690x364.png)\n\n[](https://gov.bancor.network/t/bip-increase-vortex-burner-to-10/2202#comments-8)Comments\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1.  We experienced substantial volatility in the month of May, which may not be observed in the coming months. Therefore, any analysis or conclusions on the increase of the vBNT burn shouldn't take for granted that volume and especially APRs will keep rising at this month's pace.\n2.  Bancor v3 with increased capital efficiency has been announced and should influence the APRs of all pools positively.\n3.  A low vBNT price isn't necessarily bad for the protocol as the swap fees accrued will purchase more vBNT and therefore burn it faster.\n4.  The vBNT burn has only started 1.5 months ago, so we don't have enough data to make better assessments.\n5.  vBNT burn was individually activated for all pools, hence data was taken one week after it started. Some pools might not have had the vBNT burn started then. This shouldn't affect the results, as one can still draw comparisons from the APRs observed for that week vs last week's.\n6.  LM reward emission shouldn't be taken into account when deciding vBNT burn. This is because not all pools benefit from it and the protocol should aim to optimise APRs with the current AMM model.\n7.  The data was taken from [Dune Analytics](https://duneanalytics.com/Bancor/bancor_1).\n\n[](https://gov.bancor.network/t/bip-increase-vortex-burner-to-10/2202#conclusions-9)Conclusions\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n-   Top pool APRs have risen in the past week to values that would allow a significant increase in the vBNT burn without compromising swap fee earnings.\n-   However, an increase in the vBNT burn rate to ultimately increase vBNT price and BNT locked forever in the protocol is too simple of a solution for a non-trivial problem.\n-   A variable fee structure benefits from advantages that a fixed one doesn't - the protocol cannot autonomously adjust the vBNT burn based on the vBNT price feedback.\n-   The analysis of the projected volume shows that a fair vBNT burn rate for the current volume would be 10.11%, assuming an increase to 10% on the 2nd of August.\n-   The community sentiment is that a 20% increase is too drastic of a change but 10% is an acceptable first step to consecutively gather more data.\n-   At the current rate of 0.509 BNT, the vBNT burn rate should be 10.7% according to the dynamic fee structure initially delineated.\n-   Bancor v3 is expected to increase pool APRs. A higher vBNT burn rate can also be discussed after observing the effects of the coming AMM model in LP earnings.\n-   Around 81% of the capital on Bancor is receiving LM rewards. An argument was made on the reduced impact that a vBNT burn rate increase would have on LP earnings whilst the rewards are active.\n-   As per protocol design, the vBNT burn rate must be consistent on all pools.\n\n[](https://gov.bancor.network/t/bip-increase-vortex-burner-to-10/2202#with-this-data-comments-and-conclusions-as-well-as-the-input-of-the-dao-members-in-the-original-thread-its-reasonable-to-propose-a-vorter-burner-rate-increase-to-10-10)With this data, comments, and conclusions, as well as the input of the DAO members in the original thread, it's reasonable to propose a Vorter Burner rate increase to 10%.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nVote FOR to:\n\nIncrease the Vortex Burner to 10% for all pools.\n\nVote AGAINST to:\n\nContinue with the plan for the Vortex outlined in the [(BIP9 ADDENDUM) The Bancor Vortex vBNT Burner: Proposal to Switch to a Flat Burn Rate](https://gov.bancor.network/t/bip9-addendum-the-bancor-vortex-vbnt-burner-proposal-to-switch-to-a-flat-burn-rate/1015)\\\nThe fee is increased every 6 months in 5% increments from the time of the original Vortex Launch.",

      "content": "For the proposal to pass, 20% of quorum and >67% FOR votes are needed.\n\n[View the original proposal on Discord](https://gov.bancor.network/t/proposal-extend-lm-rewards-on-dai-usdc-usdt-pool-for-8-weeks-attempt-2/2239#tldr-3)TL;DR\n========================================================================================================================\n\n-   Bancor v3 strategic positioning and maintaining pool competitiveness justify an extension on the LM rewards for the Stable Coin Pools (USDT, USDC, DAI) for the next 8 weeks. The [proposal 11](https://gov.bancor.network/t/proposal-extend-lm-rewards-on-stable-coin-pools-usdt-usdc-dai-for-8-weeks/2155) to extend them will most likely fail and the DAO is adamant about giving the LPs in the Stable Coin Pools (USDT, USDC, DAI) a chance to express their vote.\n\n-   A considerable voting power centralization in the past few days has been observed, enough to warrant a second proposal to be submitted.\n\n-   LM rewards impact on BNT inflation is minor. After Bancor v3 comes, LM rewards can be reassessed.\n\n-   The community synergy between Stable Coin LPs and Bancor cannot be overlooked. The second proposal will give Stable Coin LPs and BNT stakers in the protocol the option to stake their vBNT and participate in the voting process.\n\n-   The protocol doesn't currently allow the LM rewards rate to be altered so these will remain unchanged.\n\n-   Upon release of the shadow pools, a new LM incentives program may be considered by the DAO. It is a reasonable expectation that DAO will choose to incentivize these pools; however, it is under no obligation to do so.\n\n-   The launch of Bancor V3 and maintaining pool competitiveness justify an extension on the LM rewards for the stablecoin pool for the next X weeks. The [proposal 11](https://gov.bancor.network/t/proposal-extend-lm-rewards-on-stable-coin-pools-usdt-usdc-dai-for-8-weeks/2155) to extend them will most likely fail.\n\n-   The community was largely surprised by the failure of this proposal (and other large LM extensions) and there is reason to believe that this proposal may pass if pushed again.\n\n-   It is not feasible to change the duration or amount of LM rewards due to contract complexity. Further, if LM rewards end on a pool, it is very difficult to restart them.\n\n-   If these pools are going to be renewed, it must happen immediately.\n\n-   Bancor V3 has been announced and is likely to launch within the 8 week period that these LM rewards would be extended.\n\n-   Cutting LM on these pools now is a huge change made without knowing the effects of V3.\n\n-   It is bad business and user experience to make multiple large scale changes to the platform in a short period of time. It is smarter to wait for V3 then reassess.\n\n-   The effects of LM rewards on inflation have been overstated and the protocol can clearly gain ground in TVL and volume while they are active.\n\n[](https://gov.bancor.network/t/proposal-extend-lm-rewards-on-dai-usdc-usdt-pool-for-8-weeks-attempt-2/2239#justification-4)Justification\n=========================================================================================================================================\n\n[](https://gov.bancor.network/t/proposal-extend-lm-rewards-on-dai-usdc-usdt-pool-for-8-weeks-attempt-2/2239#renewed-interest-in-bancor-governance-5)Renewed Interest in Bancor Governance\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe proposal to renew liquidity mining rewards for the DAI/BNT, USDC/BNT and USDT/BNT pools is being resubmitted over concerns that the DAO's voting power has become significantly centralised, with the top wallets holding a considerable % of the quorum, whilst more than two-thirds of the total vBNT is unstaked and could be voting on Snapshot.\n\n-   Total Unstaked vBNT: 48,590,025\n\n-   Unstaked vBNT not in Vortex: 46,634,361\n\n-   Total vBNT staked for Governance: 13,827,950\n\n-   Only 22.2% of total vBNT is staked for Governance.\n\nTop two vBNT addresses own 15.9% and 11.2% of quorum, respectively, at a total of 27.1%.\n\n![image](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/bancordao/optimized/1X/786888e6c6b913c8b25440e0fdfb12af42f2f725_2_645x475.png)\n\nWe have seen, through massively increased activity on Twitter, Discord, and Telegram, that there is significant public concern about LINK/wBTC/stablecoin LM rewards failing to pass. The Bancor community was lax and the failure of these proposals caught them by surprise. We have seen a large amount (1.5m and counting) of vBNT stakes in governance since they failed. It is clear that the community wants to vote on this proposal again and there's reason to believe this proposal might pass now.\n\n[](https://gov.bancor.network/t/proposal-extend-lm-rewards-on-dai-usdc-usdt-pool-for-8-weeks-attempt-2/2239#contract-complexity-means-we-must-act-now-6)Contract Complexity Means We Must Act Now\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n-   Due to the design of the liquidity mining contracts, it is very difficult, bordering on impossible, to change the amount or duration of LM rewards once they have been assigned to a pool.\n\n-   For this reason, we have an all-or-nothing decision in front of us even though it may be more desirable to choose some middle ground.\n\n-   Due to the design of the contracts, it is very difficult to *reinstate* LM rewards once they have lapsed. The YFI pool, for example, had LM rewards renewed a month ago which are still not active due to the heavy lifting required by the Bancor team.\n\n-   This means that if we do not renew these LM rewards immediately, we will not get them back for weeks and perhaps ever once V3 launches.\n\n-   This decision is urgent and requires an appropriate amount of our attention.\n\n[](https://gov.bancor.network/t/proposal-extend-lm-rewards-on-dai-usdc-usdt-pool-for-8-weeks-attempt-2/2239#bancor-v3-business-positioning-and-pool-competitiveness-7)Bancor V3, Business Positioning and Pool Competitiveness\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAccording to Bancor's team recent announcement:\n\n-   Bancor V3 will be Bancor's largest and most significant upgrade to the protocol.\n\n-   V3 incorporates community feedback in the past 8 months since v2.1 went live and leverages a brand new discovery in the core AMM design that will dramatically improve the protocol's capital efficiency while reducing friction and costs for users.\n\n-   V3 unlocks a new way for passive LPs to earn even higher yields on their staked capital while being fully protected against IL. Just set, forget and earn high APRs, with no risk of IL.\n\n-   The new design will encourage more liquidity to flow into the protocol, and vastly more volume to be processed, driving sustainably high yields for Bancor LPs, and allowing the protocol to collect more revenue.\n\n-   V3 lays the foundation for Bancor to capture a much larger share of total crypto liquidity and trading revenue.\n\nBancor is on the cusp of V3. Every indication that we have says that this new version will be a massive change to the ecosystem. Meanwhile, we have seen the protocol continue to build TVL, trading volume, and general momentum on the back of LM rewards.\n\nRemoving LM rewards at this time is highly disruptive and flies in the face of every principal of [change management 1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Change_management). It is a change made without understanding what V3 will bring and will put Bancor's users through two significant disruptions in a short period of time. Total protocol changes like V3 should be made during periods of stability, not during the turmoil that would occur in this case.\n\nSome comments:\n\n1.  The protocol is still in a growth phase, both in TVL but especially in volume (Figure 1), since Bancor v2.1 was released.\n2.  Stable Coin Pools (USDT, USDC, DAI) pool have seen an average APR of 5.2% for DAI (past 60 days, Figure 2), 6.6% for USDC (past 60 days, Figure 2), and 5.6% for USDT (past 60 days, Figure 2) and gathered a total of $2,224,978.06 worth of fees combined in the past 30 days (Figure 3). To remain competitive with other protocols, LM rewards are necessary to incentivize Stable Coin Pools (USDT, USDC, DAI) liquidity to remain staked before Bancor v3 arrives.\n3.  Stablecoin pools are arguably the ones that represent the highest risk to the protocol from their increased impermanent loss. However, not only have rewards already been reduced for the pool but it should also be noted that these pools are closed and hence won't attract more liquidity, until shadow pools are released.\n\n![image](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/bancordao/original/1X/a79540e1c0ec3e358c4323b5fe1f663586b91ccc.png)\\\nFigure 1.

At this stage, current protocol growth requires LM to maintain the momentum and stay competitive in the space (the DAO seems aware of this).\n2.  After achieving the position of market leader in both TVL and volume, LM extension will no longer be necessary, and the voting for LM extensions may be concluded.\n3.  A large majority of the LM rewards are re-staked to the protocol, increasing the TVL and the space available for TKN deposits with single sided exposure. If this trend continues, the LM program is more of an asset than a liability, and can be managed more assertively.\n4.  In the long term, Bancor is aiming towards sustainable annual inflation of 4%, in order to achieve that, Bancor requires significant volume and Vortex to be applied.\n\n### [](https://gov.bancor.network/t/proposal-extend-lm-rewards-on-link-wbtc-eth-pool-for-12-weeks/2156#full-data-10)Full Data\n\n| symbol | time | Conversion Fees in USD | Volume in USD |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| WBTC | 12/28/2020 0:00 | $20,517.15 | $5,108,779.26 |\n| WBTC | 1/4/2021 0:00 | $21,684.90 | $5,732,179.11 |\n| WBTC | 1/11/2021 0:00 | $10,864.41 | $10,853,601.32 |\n| WBTC | 1/18/2021 0:00 | $10,827.82 | $10,817,048.34 |\n| WBTC | 1/25/2021 0:00 | $16,228.50 | $16,212,337.56 |\n| WBTC | 2/1/2021 0:00 | $18,087.18 | $13,745,101.42 |\n| WBTC | 2/8/2021 0:00 | $51,460.33 | $25,678,734.14 |\n| WBTC | 2/15/2021 0:00 | $117,315.62 | $58,540,546.30 |\n| WBTC | 2/22/2021 0:00 | $86,518.37 | $43,172,708.12 |\n| WBTC | 3/1/2021 0:00 | $133,351.78 | $66,542,580.72 |\n| WBTC | 3/8/2021 0:00 | $95,178.37 | $47,494,060.82 |\n| WBTC | 3/15/2021 0:00 | $69,342.19 | $34,601,785.21 |\n| WBTC | 3/22/2021 0:00 | $61,670.32 | $30,773,526.80 |\n| WBTC | 3/29/2021 0:00 | $59,763.88 | $29,822,202.59 |\n| WBTC | 4/5/2021 0:00 | $83,932.09 | $41,882,151.16 |\n| WBTC | 4/12/2021 0:00 | $131,927.02 | $65,831,635.96 |\n| WBTC | 4/19/2021 0:00 | $121,147.37 | $60,452,585.37 |\n| WBTC | 4/26/2021 0:00 | $96,150.60 | $47,979,191.16 |\n| WBTC | 5/3/2021 0:00 | $168,368.95 | $84,016,165.21 |\n| WBTC | 5/10/2021 0:00 | $179,203.47 | $89,422,564.58 |\n| WBTC | 5/17/2021 0:00 | $302,465.48 | $150,930,352.88 |\n| WBTC | 5/24/2021 0:00 | $49,188.47 | $24,545,056.47 |",

It has now grown to over $8B. This tremendous growth has benefitted the Bancor platform with added liquidity and trading volume. Over 27 million MATIC has been added to the Bancor platform because of the LM rewards. Before LM rewards were in place, less than 1 million MATIC were staked. This pool has grown to $58 million in liquidity at time of writing.\n\nMATIC has consistently had one of the highest trading volumes, with a max daily volume of over $50 million. Typical trading volumes are $10 million+ generating 20k+ fees daily.\n\nBancor’s growth as a top DEX will continue to benefit from the liquidity the MATIC stakers are providing, it is important we extend LM rewards for another 12 weeks to maintain the size of this pool.\n\nThank you for your consideration.

Since initial whitelisting, the Graph has added indexing and querying services for: Polkadot, NEAR, Celo, Solana, Polygon, Fantom and BSC, in addition to Ethereum and IPFS which have been supported since launch. The Graph has grown in query volume an average of over 20% month over month, and recently announced over 20 billion queries serviced for the month of April. They also recently unveiled Scalar, a high scalability payments service for compensating indexers for query requests. The Graph is well positioned to become a major querying service for the entirety of Web3.\n\nThe Graph pool has brought $23M of liquidity to Bancor and regularly supports daily volumes in the low seven figures. Interest in joining the GRT side of the pool has been high, with the GRT side frequently having very little or no space available. The LM Rewards mechanism clearly attracts GRT liquidity providers who are interested in APY. The current LM Rewards (plus fees) results in an APY of nearly 28%, far exceeding the APY for delegation in the Graph, which tends to be around 10%. With the much-anticipated unlocking of coins in June and July, it is possible that the Graph delegation APY would become even less attractive to stakers owing to additional competition. This would result in more significant interest in staking in the Bancor pool.\n\nAs the Graph expands with the growth of Web3, Bancor’s LM Reward support will attract more liquidity, providers, and volume. Thank you for considering this request for extension.",

      "content": "[Read the original proposal on Discourse](https://gov.bancor.network/t/proposal-for-350k-coinvestment-lm-rewards-on-0chain-zcn/2102)\n\nTL;DR\n\n-   Proposal to activate liquidity mining on ZCN\n-   Proposal to coinvest 350,000 BNT on the ZCN pool\n\nJustification\n\nOur first proposal on Bancor was to [whitelist ZCN 3](https://vote.bancor.network/#/bancornetwork.eth/proposal/QmWP9z3RRMkyVoxaC1vhkgPc8HqWcEuTEh63hq3MYVoVnC). This proposal received the [overwhelming support 2](https://twitter.com/MBRichardson87/status/1371128603564384259?s=20) of vBNT holders emanating from both the ZCN and the Bancor communities. Together, these voters surpassed the 40% quorum requirement and enabled 0Chain to join the exclusive family of single-sided liquidity pairs on Bancor.\n\nIt's no easy feat to achieve the level of voter participation necessary to pass such a proposal. We at 0Chain appreciate all individuals who took the time to examine our proposal, evaluate our project, and participate in the Bancor governance process by casting their vote.\n\nTo demonstrate our appreciation, we will be depositing 100 ZCN* into every address that casts a vote on this upcoming proposal, a deposit that will go to both 'For' and 'Against' addresses.\n\n**The 100 ZCN deposit will be valid for all vBNT holders staked in the Governance Contract as of blockheight 12457449 (Tuesday May 18, 2021), and will exclude the xBNT contract.*\n\n0Chain believes that the Whitelist achievement is a key milestone that represents a rich beginning in the Bancor/0Chain relationship. Not only do we see the Bancor network becoming ZCN's frontier decentralized exchange and liquidity resource, but we also see an exciting future in which we synergize our technologies; one where the combination of cutting edge liquidity and cloud storage solutions forges new ideas and introduces important innovations out into the world.\n\n![Screen Shot 2021-05-19 at 7.24.03 PM](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/bancordao/optimized/1X/80cf7124d7449a0d9c1cfd26ceca1d674ebfe7f2_2_505x499.jpeg)\n\n*Image 1 shows 97K BNT in the ZCN/BNT Pool. 77K BNT above the initial 20K co-investment (4x the initial Co-Investment).*\n\nOver the span of only a few weeks, this new relationship has gotten off to an impressive start. Image 1 above shows that the 20k BNT co-investment was met with open arms by our community. The maximum ZCN deposit limit has been hit on each \"open space\" opportunity. Additionally, we have nearly 5X'd the total BNT in the pool from 20,000 BNT to 97,576 BNT --- showing that[ at least 77,000 BNT 1](https://etherscan.io/address/0x22615044bb10521828845a06ec2176800a3c4b5e) out there belongs to long-term believers in both 0Chain and Bancor.\n\nWith the help of our new proposal, 0Chain will continue to build on this progress and ensure that the Bancor Network remains the number one ZCN exchange as we charge forward into our mainnet launch. We believe this proposal will yield the following impacts:\n\n-   TVL Increase. A 350k coinvestment in combination with liquidity mining rewards would create a major incentive to quickly migrate the remaining Uniswap Liquidity (~[$1m](https://etherscan.io/address/0xa6890ac41e3a99a427bef68398bf06119fb5e211)) to the current ZCN pool on Bancor ($1m). As of today, this coinvestment will support ~$3m in ZCN single-sided availability, and ~$6m in total liquidity. LM rewards will expand the total single-sided exposure as the BNT from LM rewards are re-staked. Altogether, this TVL increase will ensure that the ZCN Bancor pool grows (and remains) larger than the ZCN Uniswap pool.\n\n![|605.5755532866128x316](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/bancordao/optimized/1X/9c7b0f9a749eabe45af6df9ebee5f87624b4e040_2_690x357.png)\n\n*Image 2 shows the APR of ZCN pools compared to that of pools of similar liquidity size (ordered chronologically by liquidity), . The more liquidity that the ZCN pool gets, the more volume it should pull away from Uniswap*\n\n-   Bancor Revenue Increase. Image 2 demonstrates that ZCN is providing stronger APRs and Fees than pools that have substantially more co-investment and over twice the liquidity. This fee inflow correlates directly to Bancor revenue. Growing the depth of the ZCN pool will only strengthen the ROI for Bancor LPs and the network as whole. The APR of the ZCN pool also demonstrates that the inflow of fees should not dissipate even if the LM rewards were to run out at some point.\n\n-   Positive Impact on BNT Price. As shown in Image 1, the core 0Chain community believes strongly in BNT's future and holds a position in the BNT token. The DAO's sponsorship of ZCN continues to have a positive impact on BNT price: the 20K BNT co-investment in 0Chain led to an additional 80K BNT locked out of circulation. This shows that 0Chain is not an inflationary risk to the DAO, rather, it's the opposite -- the BNT inflation resulting from ZCN's co-investment has been considerably outpaced by new demand for BNT. We'd like to see this trend continue with our new proposal. It's in the best interest of all parties involved that the BNT rewards earned are re-invested back into the pools for the purpose of liquidity expansion. This reinvestment will keep BNT rewards off the open market and contained within the Bancor Network Vortex. Historical data has shown that LPs restake 80% of all LP rewards. There is no reason this should be different with the 0Chain community, given that the core contributors are also long on the BNT token. Altogether, this ensures that 0Chain, with its new co-investment and associated LM reward, continues to provide a positive impact on the token price of BNT.\n\nWe'd like to continue our rapid growth on Bancor and, for the reasons mentioned above, we believe that passing this proposal will facilitate new growth on our Bancor liquidity pool (and our Bancor revenues) and incentivize mass liquidity migration from Uniswap to Bancor. If we achieve these two milestones it will make Bancor the mainstay DeFi option for ZCN.\n\nThanks for reading.\n\nDisclaimer: I'm the Director of Operations for 0Chain and I own some $ZCN.\n\nWant to know more about 0Chain?

Non-custodial options with on-chain settlement. Choose any strike price, exercise at any moment.\n\nWriters: Write WBTC or ETH call and put options.Provide liquidity and start earning yield on WBTC or ETH. Auto diversiﬁcation of capital allocation.\n\nToken Holders: Earn protocol's fees in staking rewards. Receive liquidity mining & utilization rewards in HEGIC. Participate in staking and earn WBTC or ETH.\n\n![](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/bancordao/optimized/1X/e1c287fdabb487fdff11fad2bd493146f04c1f13_2_627x358.jpeg)\n\nHegic in Numbers\n\n[Hegic](https://www.hegic.co/) has achieved steady results in the second quarter since v888 beta launch. The protocol has surpassed the total amount of [3,200+ ETH options and 1,500+ WBTC options](https://hetoro.com/) acquired (calls and puts combined) in the first six months after the launch. All these options contracts were bought by 1,368 unique users (options buyers).\n\n*10 Oct 2020 - 10 Apr 2021*\n\nCumulative ETH Options - $150,011,713 ($3,725,533 fees generated)\\\nCumulative WBTC Options - $141,278,505 ($3,479,591 fees generated)\\\nTotal - $291,290,218 ($7,205,124 total fees generated)\n\nHegic TVL at moment of writing this report is sitting around ~ $61.2M\n\nFor detailed stats on Hegic, please visit: <https://terminal.tokenterminal.com/dashboard/Hegic>\n\nTokenomics\n\n*HEGIC Token*\\\nToken standard: ERC20\n\nHEGIC token on Etherscan: [$0.1703 | Hegic (HEGIC) Token Tracker | Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/token/0x584bC13c7D411c00c01A62e8019472dE68768430)\n\nHEGIC Token Distribution: 3,012,009,888 HEGIC tokens (fixed total supply, not mintable)\n\n-   20% (602,402,000 HEGIC): Early Contributors\n-   10% (301,200,988 HEGIC): Hegic Development Fund\n-   40% (1,204,809,000 HEGIC): Liquidity M&U Rewards\n-   25% (753,001,000 HEGIC): Bonding Curve\n-   5% (150,596,900 HEGIC): Balancer Pool\n\n*Bonding Curve*\n\nThe HEGIC token price increases as the supply of the token increases. When a new buyer has acquired the HEGIC token, each subsequent buyer will have to pay a slightly higher price for each token. As more people will discover Hegic protocol and buying continues, the value of each token gradually increases along the bonding curve.\n\n*Liquidity Mining & Utilization Rewards*\n\nThe purpose of three Liquidity M&U Rewards phases is to let the users of the Hegic protocol to become its owners. Liquidity providers and options buyers vote with their wallets for the protocol. That is why they have to be able to influence its future and own a fraction of the protocol.\n\nCommunity and Communication\n\nHegic is active on Twitter, Telegram, Discord, Github and Medium.\n\nTwitter: [https://twitter.com/HegicOptions](https://twitter.com/HegicOptions%5C)\\\nTelegram: [Telegram: Contact @HegicOptions](https://t.me/HegicOptions)\\\nDiscord: <https://discordapp.com/invite/znjdj8q>\\\nGithub: [Hegic - GitHub](https://github.com/hegic)\\\nMedium: [Hegic -- Medium](https://medium.com/hegic)\\\nDefipulse: [HEGIC | Stats, Charts and Guide | DeFi Pulse](https://defipulse.com/hegic)\\\nEmail: <help@hegic.co>\n\nAvailable Audits\n\nHegic has been audited by PeckShield and the reports are available via the Hegic Github page:\n\n[github.com](https://github.com/peckshield/publications/blob/master/audit_reports/PeckShield-Audit-Report-Hegic-v1.0.pdf)\n\n#### [peckshield/publications/blob/master/audit_reports/PeckShield-Audit-Report-Hegic-v1.0.pdf](https://github.com/peckshield/publications/blob/master/audit_reports/PeckShield-Audit-Report-Hegic-v1.0.pdf)\n\nMarket and Trading Data\n\n-   Hegic price at the time of writing is $0.2329.\n-   All-time high: $0.642 (13 February 2021)\n-   All-time low: $0.043 (21 September 2020)\n-   Price 90 days ago: $0.270\n-   425,355,246 tokens in circulation\n-   3,012,009,888 maximum supply\n-   The current market capitalization is $99,325,486\n-   The Hegic token is available on major exchanges, including Binance, [Gate.io](http://gate.io/), OKEx, BKEx, [Hoo.com](http://hoo.com/).",

      "title": "Increase ETH/BNT Fee to 0.15% ",
      "content": "TL:DR\n\n-   Without testing, nobody knows the optimal fee for the ETH/BNT pool.\n-   The fee has been at 0.1% for a long period of time and data on performance already exists for that time period.\n-   This proposal suggests a fee increase to 0.15% in order to evaluate any changes in volume, fees generated, vBNT burned and fees/TVL.\n\nCurrent Fee\n\nThe 0.1% fee associated with the ETH/BNT pool has been static for a long period of time. Certainly long enough for a wealth of data on:\n\n-   Volume\n-   Fees\n-   vBNT\n-   Fees/TVL\n\nNow that we have a baseline measurement, this proposal suggests that we increase the fee by a very modest 0.05% in order to monitor the consequences on the measures above.\n\nIf this performance of the protocol improves, a future proposal could suggest a further increase. I performance sufferers, a future proposal could suggest a reduction in the fee.\n\nA Philosophical Argument\n\nThe Bancor Protocol has many parameters that can be adjusted in order to fine-tune its economics. Another such example would be the Vortex Fee.\n\nThis proposal argues that in the rapidly changing world of DeFi and AMMs, we should actively be experimenting with and testing these parameters in order to consistently improve the performance of the protocol over time. This approach is similar to Toyota's Kaizen philosophy.\n\nTo quote the great Mr Dylan, \"he who is not busy being born is busy dying\".\n\nA Rational Argument\n\nThe chart below is a chart from Bancor's public Dune Dashboard and I suggest we use it as a base line.\n\nIf fees and APYs increase, then it is a strong signal that the change had a positive effect.\n\n*Note: this will actually be evaluated statistically by controlling for other factors such as TVL change, total Ethereum DEX volume and more factors.\n\n![Screen Shot 2021-05-06 at 10.54.20](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/bancordao/optimized/1X/4b1c58ef805d8710c360038fbcfc891b68ab633f_2_690x451.png)\n\nVoting Instructions\n\nTo support changing the fee to 0.15%, vote FOR\n\nTo oppose changing the fee, vote AGAINST",

It makes staked ETH liquid and allows participation with any amount of ETH.\n\nWhen using Lido to stake your ETH on the Ethereum beacon chain, users will receive a token (stETH), which represents their ETH on the Ethereum beacon chain on a 1:1 basis. It effectively acts as a bridge bringing ETH 2.0's staking rewards to ETH 1.0.\n\nAs a user's staked ETH generates staking rewards from ETH 2.0, the user's ETH balance on the beacon chain will increase. stETH balances will update correspondingly once per day allowing you to access on ETH 1.0 the value of your staking rewards received on ETH 2.0.\n\nUsers can use stETH in all of the same ways that they can use ETH: sell it, spend it and, since it is compatible to be used in DeFi, use it as collateral for on-chain lending. When transactions are enabled on ETH 2.0, users can also redeem stETH for ETH.\n\n[](https://gov.bancor.network/t/whitelist-lido-dao-token-ldo-plus-750k-bnt-co-investment-limit/2038#tokenomics-7)Tokenomics\n===========================================================================================================================\n\nThe LDO token is the [governance token](https://blog.lido.fi/introducing-ldo/) for Lido DAO.

      "content": "[Read the original proposal on Discourse](https://gov.bancor.network/t/proposal-increase-co-investment-limit-to-250k-bnt-on-cel-celsius-network-pool/2047)\n\nTLDR\n\n-   This proposal seeks to increase the Co-investment limit to 250K BNT in the CEL pool.\n-   It will open up space for LPs on the TKN side (CEL) and potentially lead to an increase in the depth of the pool as LPs add liquidity\n-   A larger CEL pool will attract more trades from aggregators and professional market makers to Bancor which ultimately leads to more fees for our platform.\n\nAbstract\\\nThere is currently 17.4K BNT and 19.9K CEL tokens in the BNT-CEL [pool 1](https://etherscan.io/address/0x954F1943Af6f46971ee4C81E73f9103359F7D25d). This has resulted in a pool that has roughly ~276K in liquidity. At the moment, LPs on the TKN side (CEL) can't provide single sided liquidity since there is no capacity. This proposal is seeking to increase single-sided capacity in the CEL pool by increasing the Co-investment limit to 250K BNT.\n\nMotivation\n\nIf we want to attract more CEL LPs to Bancor, we need to open up space in the pool so that they can provide single sided liquidity. This would allow us to grow the liquidity in the pool and attract larger trades towards our platform which ultimately results in higher fees for Bancor.\n\nThe CEL-BNT pool data shows that it roughly filled up completely on the week of 3/22/2021:\n\n![image](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/bancordao/optimized/1X/e01a4b44832b22278d4bcfe9a214076f0151ffd3_2_690x246.png)\n\nThis suggest to me that there is demand from LPs on the CEL side to provide liquidity and we should open up space from our side.\n\nThe top pool for CEL is on Uniswap (not much on other DEXes) and it is paired with ETH. We should strive to make the Bancor pool deeper to support larger trades (equates to lower slippage).\n\n![image](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/bancordao/optimized/1X/3afb7ea6a6d436f827991e039f9757d4211e6b12_2_690x352.jpeg)\n\nCurrently, this pool is filled completely on Bancor and LPs can't provide single sided liquidity on the TKN side (CEL). I am proposing a 250K Co-investment limit for the CEL pool which should open up roughly 1.7M in single sided liquidity (assuming BNT price at $7.00). If this pools fills up completely, we would have a pool that's roughly ~3.5M in depth.\n\nThis pool won't have too much competition from CEXes since most of the liquidity resides on DEXes\n\n![image](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/bancordao/original/1X/64e8ed96959b9b8bc3fa5d72c9398481da335a69.png)\n\nFor\n\n1.  A larger co-investment limit on the pool will let LPs provided single sided liquidity and will lead to an increase in pool depth\n2.  More liquidity in the CEL-BNT pool should lead to larger volume from DEX aggregators and professional market makers sent in our direction\n3.  More volume for Bancor leads to more fees for our platform and BNT holders\n\nAgainst\n\n1.  We should not increase the limit on the pool\n2.  We do not need extra liquidity in our platform to support larger trades\n3.  We do not need to generate fees for our platform or BNT holders",

The native token represents a standard unit of utility in this economy. The value of a token depends on the network's bandwidth capacity and its utilization. Routers earn tokens by sharing their bandwidth with customers (i.e. users of the network). The token will be used to create connections between devices or servers, those endpoints will also need tokens to interact with the blockchain. So the more connections and endpoints will be created, more transactions will be on our blockchain and tokens used. Secondly, tokens will be used in staking to provide security for our validators Third, tokens will be used as exchange of value to pay relay nodes for the optimised traffic they provide. Finally we have a long vision to connect different decentralised infrastructure services together through our decentralised web services platform and the token will be the engine running all blockchain related activities.\n\nSyntropy Tokenomics: [Syntropy Net 1](https://www.syntropynet.com/docs/tokenomics)\n\nSyntropy Staking: [Syntropy Net](https://www.syntropynet.com/docs/staking)\n\n[](https://gov.bancor.network/t/proposal-to-whitelist-noia-syntropy-150k-co-investment-and-killer-tech/2033#market-and-trading-data-5)Market and Trading Data\n=============================================================================================================================================================\n\n-   NOIA's price at the time of writing is $0.665\n-   All-time high: $0.8858 (21th April 2021)\n-   All-time low: $0.002947 (16th March, 2020)\n-   368,119,987 NOIA tokens in circulation\n-   1,000,000,000 maximum supply.\n-   The current market capitalization is $228,057,450.\n-   The NOIA token is available on Kucoin, Uniswap, and Nash exchanges.\n-   The 24-hour volumes among those exchanges range from $1,192,273 to $10,770,532.\n\n[](https://gov.bancor.network/t/proposal-to-whitelist-noia-syntropy-150k-co-investment-and-killer-tech/2033#how-white-listing-helps-the-bancor-protocol-6)How White Listing Helps The Bancor Protocol\n=====================================================================================================================================================================================================\n\nSyntropy is currently running a Liquidity Program on UNI ([Introducing the NOIA Liquidity Program on Uniswap | by Domantas Jaskunas | Syntropy | Medium 5](https://medium.com/syntropynet/introducing-the-noia-liquidity-program-on-uniswap-4c677fecce5)) which would be terminated and switched (or run in parallel) to support the Bancor pool thereby attracting existing LPs and increasing their potential APY.\n\nAcquiring users and building a community also relies on some more traditional means and methods. At this point, we are confident about the target user we need to reach, which helps us narrow down on our marketing efforts and makes us more efficient in promoting Bancor pool. Some of our marketing activities include:\n\n1.  PR. We've partnered with some leading PR agencies that have experience working with developer and crypto audiences who can definitely help us with promoting Bancor pool as well.\n2.  Pay-per-click campaigns. Our research has shown that developer and crypto audiences congregate on Twitter and Reddit, and we will be focusing on these networks for our initial PPC campaigns to promote Bancor listing as well. This will provide us with a constant drip of new users and increase brand awareness.\n3.  Content marketing. It is central to our marketing and community building efforts. We will share news about Bancor pool on every social media platform (for example Twitter has 30k members). We are sure that our content will resonate with our audiences.\n\n[](https://gov.bancor.network/t/proposal-to-whitelist-noia-syntropy-150k-co-investment-and-killer-tech/2033#community-and-communication-7)Community and Communication\n=====================================================================================================================================================================\n\n[Read the original proposal on Discourse](https://gov.bancor.network/t/proposal-to-whitelist-noia-syntropy-150k-co-investment-and-killer-tech/2033)",

The vote achieved a 58.5% vote for whitelisting, but unfortunately did not manage to attract enough votes for quorum. The Unibright community was disappointed with this outcome, and received the following feedback:\n\n-   1m Co-investment Limit was too high (even though it was lowered to 200K for the actual vote)\n-   While the information included in the proposal was extensive, it did not focus specifically on why whitelisting would be beneficial for BNT token holders.\n-   The Unibright Community need to engage with the larger vBNT holders if the proposal is to pass quorum\n\nSo, for this new proposal I will focus specifically on these aspects, rather than just repeating the previous one. It is really important that voters highlight any concerns or unseen issues so that they can be addressed before the votes goes live, because that is what the discussion forum is for -- to iron out anything before the vote goes live.\n\n[](https://gov.bancor.network/t/proposal-to-whitelist-noia-syntropy-150k-co-investment-and-killer-tech/2033#project-3)Co-Investment Limit\n=============================================================================================================================\n\n200K BNT at the time of writing is approximately $1.4m. Unibright is currently listed on two other Liquidty Pool exchanges. Uniswap has grown to $6.1m ($3.05m UBT) and has been listed there for well over a year now. More recently, UBT was added to Quickswap and within the first week it attracted nearly $2m of liquidity ($1M UBT). The value of UBT on Quickswap has since reduced, primarily due to people not wanting to be exposed to Impermanent loss.\n\nThere is definitely demand from the UBT community to partake in a BNT pool, and with a relatively low Co-Investment Limit, the pool should reach $1.4m relatively quickly and easily. that said the BNT co investment will be proposed in a different proposal so that this proposal is much more likely to pass the vote. we need to do this step by step and make it so small as possible.\n\n[](https://gov.bancor.network/t/proposal-to-whitelist-noia-syntropy-150k-co-investment-and-killer-tech/2033#project-3)Why Whitelisting is Beneficial for BNT Holders\n=============================================================================================================================\n\nThere is already proven demand from UBT traders and investors for exchanges like Bancor. The APY for Uniswap pool typically ranges from 40-60% APY, which show that there is a consistently high amount of volume and that it is providing a good return for Liquidity providers. Similarly, Uniswap represents a high percentage of the \"real\" volume. The community is well aware of the non-custodial benefits a DEX offers. With Bancor's integration with aggregators like 1inch and Paraswap, a move for traders and arbitrageurs to Bancor will be seamless and would easily take a large slice of fees from Uniswap.\n\nThe trading volume is likely to improve significantly over the coming months as both the \"Baseledger\" and \"Baseliine-as-a-Service\" tokenomics see full adoption. There are two key parts to the tokenomics that will increase volume (and therefore fees):\n\nUBT is the Gas for Enterprise Blockchain - Clients pay fiat to Provide Payments who purchase UBT on the open market from any of the exchanges where UBT is listed. If UBT is whitelisted for Bancor, there is no reason why they would not make use of Bancor. Of the initial purchase of UBT from exchanges, 50% is locked a licence fee, and 50% is used and rebought on the open market throughout the duration of the contract. This means that there are one off lump sums purchased for the initial lock, but then also there is continued buy and sell volume created by the use of UBT as a payment token for gas. This means each new client is going to be bringing more and more volume for the token (and therefore fees)\n\nUBT is the native token for Baseledger -- The purpose built blockchain for Baselining. This enterprise focused blockchain is currently being built and will involve constant buy pressure from clients, and also some sell pressure from node operators looking to cover running costs. And all this buy and sell pressure will occur through the open markets, on exchanges like Bancor (as long as it is whitelisted!). Clients pay a flat fee in fiat which is then converted on the open market into UBT tokens, that is then used to pay node operators and stakers for providing consensus. These nodes and stakers will then need to either restake or sell their rewards, again on the open market (on exchanges like Bancor, if it is whitelisted!).\n\nSo, in summary, there is currently good volume for the UBT token on Uniswap and it is generating good fees for Liquidity providers on Uniswap, but over time there are more mechanisms in the not too distant future that will come in to play that will push the trading volumes up significantly.\n\n[](https://gov.bancor.network/t/proposal-to-whitelist-noia-syntropy-150k-co-investment-and-killer-tech/2033#project-3)Engaging more with the Voters (especially the larger ones!)\n=============================================================================================================================\n\nFirstly, thank you to every voter who took the time to vote on the proposal, who asked questions and supported the proposal in any shape and form. The Unibright community tweeted and shared the proposal everywhere we could, answered questions, talked about the vote and tried to get as many votes as we could. But the biggest barrier was clearly getting enough votes to pass quorum. Feedback we received was positive, and I don't remember seeing anything negative other than the initial co-investment limit was too high. And this was acted on.\n\nSo, I guess our question is why did only 12.1% of eligible voters vote for/against the proposal? When it is a gasless vote this is surprising. What can we do? Who should we talk to? There are clearly some big voters out there who passed on the chance to vote and it would be great to try and understand why this was the case, and what can be done to persuade you to vote or engage with this proposal.\n\nThis proposal is open to any and all suggestions, so please do give any feedback that you can. Positive or negative, any is appreciated!",

They seem to be informed on IL and have asked about LPing here multiple times.\n-   Ben Yorke, part of Wootrade's team, has mentioned they would like to \"help drive volume and liquidity to potentially get the community to vote for LM rewards\".\n-   Wootrade has rewarded Uniswap and Sushiswap with WOO LM reward . A similar situation could happen with Bancor if we can bring their community over and the feature is made available in the meantime.\n\n[](https://gov.bancor.network/t/proposal-increase-co-investment-limit-on-woo-to-500k-bnt/2000#stats-3)Stats\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n![image](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/bancordao/optimized/1X/69a79c17298a86e75434eba401ce678df3320d0e_2_689x190.png)\n\n### [](https://gov.bancor.network/t/proposal-increase-co-investment-limit-on-woo-to-500k-bnt/2000#current-cexdex-pools-4)Current CEX/DEX pools\n\n![image](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/bancordao/optimized/1X/62847cfe5abf737673c83b53ff6bfc01e93e042d_2_690x382.png)\n\nAs per debate:\n\n[@glenn](https://gov.bancor.network/u/glenn)\n\n> I think we want to have higher liquidity than sushiswap but not necessarily as high as uniswap.\n>\n> ![image](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/bancordao/original/1X/1be6b2e1aed280ee215c17edadd88565d2145530.png)\n>\n> I would say go higher and start at 500K so that we can have a ~7M pool when it fills up completely.

      "content": "[Read the original proposal on Discourse](https://gov.bancor.network/t/proposal-increase-co-investment-limit-to-250k-bnt-on-mln-enzyme-finance-pool/2015)\n\nTLDR\n\n-   This proposal seeks to increase the Co-investment limit to 250K BNT in the MLN pool.\n-   It will open up space for LPs on the TKN side (MLN) and potentially lead to an increase in the depth of the pool as LPs add liquidity\n-   A larger MLN pool will attract more trades from aggregators and professional market makers to Bancor which ultimately leads to more fees for our platform.\n\nAbstract\\\nThere is currently 24.6K BNT and 1616 MLN tokens in the BNT-MLN [pool 1](https://etherscan.io/address/0x378E0279431Db7D255918b8C53b14C1aCfd90106). This has resulted in a pool that has roughly 370K in liquidity. At the moment, LPs on the TKN side (MLN) can't provide single sided liquidity since there is no capacity. This proposal is seeking to increase single-sided capacity in the MLN pool by increasing the Co-investment limit to 250K BNT.\n\nMotivation\n\nIf we want to attract more MLN LPs to Bancor, we need to open up space in the pool so that they can provide single sided liquidity. This would allow us to grow the liquidity in the pool and attract larger trades towards our platform which ultimately results in higher fees for Bancor.\n\nThe MLN-BNT pool data shows that it roughly filled up completely on the week of 3/15/2021:\n\n![image](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/bancordao/optimized/1X/c32a6d610125c2881d3469ff6fc44a5153eabc60_2_690x246.png)\n\nand only recently saw a small bump in MLN liquidity after more space was opened. This suggest to me that there is demand from LPs on the MLN side to provide liquidity and we should open up space from our side.\n\nThe top pool for MLN is on Uniswap (not much on other DEXes) and it is paired with ETH. We should strive to make the Bancor pool deeper to support larger trades (equates to lower slippage).\n\n![image](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/bancordao/optimized/1X/4c01afc7f75d7e4dd7898d30e66264b02b284acb_2_690x309.jpeg)\n\nCurrently, this pool is filled completely on Bancor and LPs can't provide single sided liquidity on the TKN side (MLN). I am proposing a 250K Co-investment limit for the MLN pool which should open up roughly 1.7M in single sided liquidity (assuming BNT price at $7.00). If this pools fills up completely, we would have a pool that's roughly ~3.5M in depth.\n\nFor\n\n1.  A larger co-investment limit on the pool will let LPs provided single sided liquidity and will lead to an increase in pool depth\n2.  More liquidity in the MLN-BNT pool should lead to larger volume from DEX aggregators and professional market makers sent in our direction\n3.  More volume for Bancor leads to more fees for our platform and BNT holders\n\nAgainst\n\n1.  We should not increase the limit on the pool\n2.

Additionally, you can also be a liquidity provider on exchanges with your xAssets, allowing you to simultaneously earn LP fees and compounding staking rewards.\n\nA full list of benefits for xTokens (a.k.a xAssets) are listed below:\n\n-   participate fully in staking returns\n-   set-and-forget investments\n-   compounding returns\n-   delegated, opinionated options for governance\n-   tax benefits\n-   liquid collateral representations of your staking positions\n\n[](https://gov.bancor.network/t/proposal-whitelist-xtoken-governance-token-xtk-plus-250k-bnt-co-investment-limit/1985#tokenomics-7)Tokenomics\n=============================================================================================================================================\n\nXTK is xToken's native token that will be used to govern the xToken project. Their token is distributed in the following [proportions](https://docs.xtoken.market/xtk):\n\n-   Community Vesting --- 50% : liquidity incentive and engagement programs, paid out over 2 -- 4 years. This includes our initial liquidity incentives launching today, as well as future liquidity and community engagement programs to be announced soon.\n\n-   Early Investors and Advisors --- 12.9% : all investor and advisor allocations vest on a 2 year linear schedule with a 1 year cliff, initiated no earlier than September 10, 2020. This means that zero investor/advisor tokens unlock before September 10, 2021 and some investor/advisor allocations don't begin unlocking until several months later.\n\n-   Current and Future Team --- 20% : all current and future team member allocations vest on a 4 year linear schedule with a 1 year cliff, initiated no earlier than September 10, 2020. This means that zero team member tokens unlock before September 10, 2021 and some team allocations don't begin unlocking until several months later.\n\n-   Growth and Ecosystem Fund --- 17.1% : this is xToken's long term treasury reserve. Any future investor allocation and all growth, development and ecosystem initiatives will be funded from this pool.\n\n![image](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/bancordao/optimized/1X/08e861f6bc71563194bb3732c493c6c327b5ed5b_2_621x500.png)\n\nThe xToken platform is heavily incentivizing users to contribute to select liquidity pools composed of their xTokens (A.K.A. xAssets). The program is incentivizing the adoption of xTokens (A.K.A. xAssets) by rewarding xAssets holders that provide liquidity to xAssets pools. Liquidity providers can stake their LP tokens to receive XTK rewards. There doesn't appear to be a native way to stake XTK tokens in the xTokens platform but they are currently incentivizing LP providers of the XTK-ETH pool on Uniswap.\n\nxToken closed a seed round in September 2020.

      "content": "[Read the original proposal on Discourse](https://gov.bancor.network/t/proposal-re-activate-lm-rewards-on-the-ren-pool/1887)\n\n### This proposal previously appeared on Snapshot, prematurely. The DAO guidelines are available in the Information and Templates section of the Discourse page. In particular, the [policies set forth by BIP3, BIP12, and the BIP12 Addendum](https://gov.bancor.network/t/a-guide-to-bancordao-due-process/1669) require all proposals to be published to Discourse prior to their submission on Snapshot, with a clearly stated timeframe for voting to begin. While there is no nefarious intent, it is important to maintain the DAO process. \n\n# TL;DR\n\n* Extend previously approved LM rewards on the REN pool for a further 12 weeks.\n* REN has attracted a liquidity pool of over $25m at the time of writing, while being amongst the top 12-13 in transaction volume on Bancor.\n\n# Voting Instructions\n\n* Vote FOR to extend LM rewards on REN for 12 weeks\n* Vote AGAINST for no change to current REN pool\n* Stake BNT in a protected pool on [http://bancor.network](http://bancor.network/)\n* Stake vBNT in the governance contract on Ethereum 1\n* Use vBNT to vote\n\n# Discussion\n\n* REN has attracted over $25,000,000 of liquidity in the REN/BNT pool.\n* The REN pool currently has more transaction volume than 6 of the other tokens currently earning LM rewards, indicating it is a major asset for BNT stakers.\n* Ren offers a suite of tokens that can be bridged in a decentralized manner such as renDOGE, renZEC, etc. And soon there will also be renSOL and renFTM. It is my contention that unifying the Ren and Bancor ecosystem presents truly interesting prospects as both projects continued their growth and innovation.\n\nREN pool, as one of the OG pools on bancor, has been deprived of its LM rewards for too long!\n\n\n\nREN is a go-to protocol for cross-blockchain liquidity and using assets from different chains in\nDeFi applications, earning yield. In less than 12 months RenVM had almost 4 billion dollars in volume, and its total value locked is 720 million dollars.\n\nAs interoperability becomes the key that connects all the different DeFi chains (Ethereum, Polkadot, Solana, BSC, Avalanche...), the demand for using RenVM and the REN token is gonna increase significantly. \n\nREN has been among the first pools on Bancor that provided LM rewards and as of now still has just sub 30 millions dollars in liquidity and 2 million dollars in daily volume. It is true that liquidity did not drop as significantly as expected with the end of the reward period, but rest assured that without the LM incentive the liquidity will slowly dribble away to platforms that will provide more incentive. We can still see REN pool doing even better than The Graph and Matic pool, which have great rewards and are recent.\n\nIt would be a shame to lose many REN providers on Bancor. Let's change that.\n\nI propose to continue the current LM rewards for another 12 weeks to keep liquidity on Bancor and attempt to encourage more deposits.\n\nThere is an auditable provenance for the community's interest in extending the LM program on REN, prior to the reorganization of the Discourse page: \n\nhttps://gov.bancor.network/t/ren-lm-extension/1444\n\n### How is helps the Bancor Protocol\n\nIt is imperative to know that the only value on REN token is to bond it into a darknode and receive a share of fees that are generated with use of RenVM. 100k REN is what needs to be bonded for a darknode and quiet frankly for a lot of people that is too much money and they could never run 1 by themselves. Bancor with its one-sided pools, full IL protection after 100 days and great rewards surpasses darknodes rewards and also enables you to be a bit more liberal with your holdings as there is no lockup in bancor protocol. \n\nIt would help Bancor, because as we are active in the REN community, so many people are looking for yield on their REN and they can not get anything without a darknode. Many people would add much more liquidity to bancor, and economics incentives are the best to spread the word of bancors amazing AMM experience. With more liquidity and demand for REN the more volume would come in as well, to further boost liquidity providers profitability.  \n\n* Decent swap fees on the REN/BNT pool. We can check historic data using [Dune Analytics](https://duneanalytics.com/Bancor/bancor_1).  I think we can argue that our average swap fees are higher than those for SNX, AAVE, OCEAN, YFI and even LINK. \n\n* The imminent creation of the Darknode Community Fund, which may see the REN community bringing further liquidity to Bancor for renFIL, renBCH. REN Community will soon have the power to support protocols that are incentivising the use of renAssets (to the tune of 5% of darknode income per epoch).  That might take the form of, for example, seeking to have renAssets whitelisted on Bancor and providing liquidity for the relevant renAsset pools.  The REN community would also be promoting the use of Bancor for swaps / trades on REN and renAssets.\n\n**![|563x296](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/bancordao/optimized/1X/2151a45591d8e2e08e3d3a5a58fb7997ea81c9f2_2_563x296.jpeg)**\n\n**![|569x299](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/bancordao/optimized/1X/926e6faadbfe0e8b63a4c11a671f73083c66460d_2_569x299.jpeg)**\n\n**![|563x328](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/bancordao/optimized/1X/4ed77c150fc3c5ea1e25c1458f883b40809e763d_2_563x328.jpeg)**\n\n**![|563x296](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/bancordao/optimized/1X/b8657cd3652c85f0b4f894121c3e4e5be099cd51_2_563x296.jpeg)**\n\n**![|624x327](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/bancordao/optimized/1X/0dfe2b677129b338c6b1a99e757437cd504ea3c3_2_624x327.jpeg)**\n\n**![|624x328](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/bancordao/optimized/1X/a208ae33928bc4d77d2e2512bf6a5c1d454b48a0_2_624x328.jpeg)**",

      "title": "Proposal: Increase Co-investment Limit to 500K BNT on MANA (Decentraland) Pool",
      "content": "# TLDR\n\n* This proposal seeks to increase the Co-investment limit to 500K BNT in the MANA pool.\n* It will open up space for LPs on the TKN side (MANA) and potentially lead to an increase in the depth of the pool as LPs add liquidity\n* A larger MANA pool will attract more trades from aggregators and professional market makers to Bancor which ultimately leads to more fees for our platform.\n\n# Abstract\nThere is currently 116.8K BNT and 625.8K MANA tokens in the BNT-MANA [pool](https://etherscan.io/address/0x16706f5561B88F4c80Ce9B35b2C02dFb0E22DD87). This has resulted in a pool that has roughly 1.6M in liquidity. At the moment, LPs on the TKN side (MANA) can’t provide single sided liquidity since there is no capacity. This proposal is seeking to increase single-sided capacity in the MANA pool by increasing the Co-investment limit to 500K BNT.\n\n# Motivation\n\nIf we want to attract more MANA LPs to Bancor, we need to open up space in the pool so that they can provide single sided liquidity. This would allow us to grow the liquidity in the pool and attract larger trades towards our platform which ultimately results in higher fees for Bancor.\n\nThe MANA-BNT pool data shows that it has roughly filled up completely on the week of 3/8/2021:\n\n![image|690x237](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/bancordao/optimized/1X/f182f9d7ca9930f890d641fb58f36f212d099f8f_2_690x237.png) \n\nThis suggest to me that there is demand for LPs on the MANA side to provide liquidity and we should open up space from our side.\n\nThe top pool for MANA is on Uniswap (not much on other DEXes) and it is paired with ETH. We should strive to make the Bancor pool deeper to support larger trades (equates to lower slippage).\n\n![image|690x311](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/bancordao/optimized/1X/2edc377ae1093d684778d4c955450156792e6a69_2_690x311.jpeg) \n\nCurrently, this pool is filled completely on Bancor and LPs can’t provide single sided liquidity on the TKN side (MANA). I am proposing a 500K Co-investment limit for the MANA pool which should open up roughly 3.5M in single sided liquidity (assuming BNT price at $7.00). If this pools fills up completely, we would have a pool that’s roughly ~7M in depth. Our pool will also be competing with CEXes that also have large amounts of MANA\n\n![image|208x500](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/bancordao/optimized/1X/01655f31bafab11ba50c67b2d1dfffd2637eda0a_2_208x500.png) \n\nIf we attract MANA LPs and grow the pool to its full capacity, we will roughly have ~2.69M  in MANA tokens (assuming price of $1.30 for MANA) which would put us in the ~9th place among CEXes.\n\n# For\n\n1. A larger co-investment limit on the pool will let LPs provided single sided liquidity and will lead to an increase in pool depth\n2. More liquidity in the MANA-BNT pool should lead to larger volume from DEX aggregators and professional market makers sent in our direction\n3. More volume for Bancor leads to more fees for our platform and BNT holders\n\n# Against\n\n1. We should not increase the limit on the pool\n2. We do not need extra liquidity in our platform to support larger trades\n3. We do not need to generate fees for our platform or BNT holders",

      "content": "[Read the original proposal on Discourse](https://gov.bancor.network/t/proposal-increase-co-investment-limit-on-ewt-to-250k-bnt/1916)\n\n# TL;DR\n\n* This Proposal seeks to increase the Co-Investment Limit on the EWT Pool to 250k BNT. Making us the largest DEX pool.\n* It will open up space on the TKN side (EWT) and potentially lead to an increase in the depth of the pool as LPs add liquidity.\n* A larger EWT pool will attract more trades from aggregators and professional market makers to Bancor which will provide more fees to the platform.\n\n# Abstract\n\nThere is currently 450K~ USD In the EWT Liquidity Pool on Bancor, with the pool accruing double digit APRs regularly. As of right now there is no space left in the EWT Pool with 50k~ BNT needed to open up any more space. This proposal is intended to increase the co-investment on said pool to 250k BNT, offering enough room for roughly 1.5M USD worth of space at a 6$ BNT.\n\n# Motivation\n\nThe current pool of EWT has grown to a large depth organically without the use of LM Rewards and there are not too many options for EWT holders to utilize their capital. The Pool on Bancor has also clearly attracted EWT holders naturally and I think their overall attitude towards their token is that of long term holders which makes it a good fit.\n\n![Screen Shot 2021-04-26 at 6.02.54 PM|690x289](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/bancordao/optimized/1X/eb1dc3e46746e939fe59af4769d9512f07866672_2_690x289.jpeg) \n\nAs we can see by the Pool in UNI the Liquidity to Volume Ratios are incredibly lucrative and consistent. If we want to take a bigger market share of EWT Fees it would make sense for us to want to have the deepest pool. A 250k BNT Co-Investment would allow us to at first match and then eventually overtake the liquidity on Uniswap.\n\n\n# Stats\n![Screen Shot 2021-04-26 at 2.30.23 PM|690x172](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/bancordao/optimized/1X/5745c3e41a51eb85dd0a8710726c51b44aee3fe4_2_690x172.png) \n\n# Current CEX Pools.\n![Screen Shot 2021-04-26 at 2.21.11 PM|690x371](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/bancordao/optimized/1X/e7aa5a88395abf8e3fa6b790b02625a84261055c_2_690x371.png) \n\n\n# For\n1. A larger co-investment limit on the pool will let LPs provided single sided liquidity and will lead to an increase in pool depth.\n2. More liquidity in the EWT-BNT pool should lead to larger volume from DEX aggregators and professional market makers sent in our direction\n3. More volume for Bancor leads to more fees for our platform and BNT holders\n\n# Against\n1. We should not increase the limit on the pool\n2.

      "content": "[Read the original proposal on Discourse](https://gov.bancor.network/t/offer-trader-incentives-via-a-pool-race/1848)\n\n**Summary:**\nCreate a campaign that incentivizes token communities to trade on Bancor in order to receive liquidity mining rewards.\n\n**Background:**\nBancor has become well-known as a platform to provide liquidity and earn passive, reliable yield with no impermanent loss. As liquidity rises, Bancor is increasing its efforts to spread awareness among users that Bancor is also an excellent place to trade tokens.\n\nPart of these efforts include bancor.network updates designed to better serve trader communities, including limit orders, historical charts and market analysis tools.\n\nAs a complement to app improvements, Bancor is launching a series of trader acquisition campaigns -- and Pool Races could be among the first to launch.\n\n**How Pool Races could work**\n\n* All pools that meet the criteria at the start date below are eligible to win:\n  * Active pools on Bancor with $1M or more liquidity\n  * Already whitelisted (at start date, this allows time for tokens to apply for white listing in order to participate)\n  * No previous or current LM rewards on the pool\n* 2 Winning pools automatically get 10K BNT per week for 4 weeks (40K BNT total):\n  * Winner 1:\n    * The pool that generates swaps from the most unique wallets.\n  * Winner 2:\n    * The pool that gets the most retweets.\n\nNote: If the same pool wins both, the pool with the highest number of traders and the second most retweeted pools both win.\n\nWhy retweets? Larger tokens will naturally have an advantage in terms of trader count, while RTs will allow lower-cap tokens to better compete.\n\n# Steps for a Pool Race:\n\n1. Receive approval from the BancorDAO\n\n2. Publish a blog post about the race (including start and end dates).\na. Pools that fit criteria (above) on start day will be included.\nb. Call to action: get your favorite token whitelisted ASAP!\nc. Alert token communities about the campaign.\n\n3. On start date of race:\na. Publish a list of qualified pools\nb. Tweet each pool (inviting retweets from respective token communities)\n\n4. At end date:\na. Calculate traders per pool and identify winner\nb. Count RTs per tweet and identify winner\n\n5. Publish winners\n6. Commence LM for winners\n7. Evaluate effectiveness and determine whether it’s worth doing again",

      "content": "[Read the original proposal on Discourse](https://gov.bancor.network/t/proposal-to-whitelist-lpl/1831)\n\n## TL;DR\n\n* Proposal to whitelist LinkPool (LPL), activating single-sided exposure and IL protection.\n* There are no apparent security concerns that would prohibit whitelist status.\n* Proposed co-investment is 1,000,000 BNT\n* There is no reason to doubt the legitimacy of the LinkPool project.\n* LinkPool would not add major risk to the Bancor Protocol.\n* Since the inception of the ERC-20 token, LPL has consistently been a top pool on Bancor in both liquidity and volume among protected and non-protected pools alike.\n\nLinkPool token address:\n0x99295f1141d58a99e939f7be6bbe734916a875b8\n\nProject Websites:\nhttps://linkpool.io/\nhttps://app.linkpool.io/\n\nhttps://docs.linkpool.io/\n\nhttps://market.link/\n\n## Project\n\n[LinkPool](https://linkpool.io/) [1] is a leading Chainlink node service provider with the goal of providing tools and services that benefit the Chainlink ecosystem. Their aims include lowering the barrier to entry to staking on Chainlink nodes, easing the amount of technical experience required to run a Chainlink node, and providing smart contract creators with the tools to easily search and identify Chainlink nodes that can suit their data requirements. LinkPool achieves these goals by offering an easy to use and intuitive staking dApp, providing node infrastructure through their eventual [Node as a Service (NaaS)](https://medium.com/linkpool/announcing-node-as-a-service-2034ee42d2d9) [2] and [managed node offerings](https://linkpool.io/#service-slides/3) [3], and their industry first [Chainlink Market](https://market.link/) [4], the definitive listing service and search engine for the Chainlink network. They have also developed [powerful, trustless contracts](https://medium.com/linkpool/creating-trustless-pools-and-staking-for-all-266451277e3f) [5] that can fairly distribute any form of revenue between a set of wallets.\n\nThe project was born thanks to two Chainlink community members ([Jonny Huxtable](https://twitter.com/HuxtableJonny) [6] and Mat Beale) who started talking through the now defunct Chainlink Slack channel and realized that [Chainlink staking](https://medium.com/linkpool/staking-with-chainlink-b58eb3de6f1b) [7] was not going to be easy for the average Joe, due to the fact that it is much more difficult to manage a Chainlink oracle than to manage a PoS or PoW blockchain node. So they decided to [come up with a project](https://s3.linkpool.io/LinkPool+Whitepaper.pdf) [8] that would allow users to deposit LINK collateral on the [LinkPool node](https://etherscan.io/address/0x240bae5a27233fd3ac5440b5a598467725f7d1cd) [9] in a secure and decentralized way so that users could experience the benefits of staking, without having to be exposed to most of the risks involved.\n\nBetween April 15, 2018 and July 31, 2018 LinkPool opened a crowdsale to raise funds in which they offered 25% of their company for sale in the form of 1000 tokenized shares in exchange for 1000 ETH. Thanks to said crowdsale they managed to raise ~705 ETH, however [they decided to proportionally distribute](https://medium.com/linkpool/crowdsale-completion-unsold-portion-distribution-and-token-transfers-dd226d06acad) [10] the \"unsold” portion among those who had contributed ETH to the crowdsale.\n\nA lot has changed since then: on March 26, 2021, [LinkPool announced that they had redesigned both their token and their platform](https://medium.com/linkpool/staking-app-v2-and-token-migration-9b3d1672cd45) [11]. Among various reasons (listed below), this was done because [the original LinkPool token (LP)’s contract](https://etherscan.io/address/0x182d4990bb0ff595b308b3efcb93313abad575e7) [12] had integrated a biweekly airdrop mechanism that did not conform to the ERC-20 token standard. The original token also presented additional problems:\n\n* Lack of visibility within the DeFi ecosystem\n* Lack of liquidity: there used to be [a very feature-limited DEX](https://staking.linkpool.io/dex) [13] as the only way to acquire LinkPool tokens.\n* Significant barrier to entry (a minimum of 0.04 LP with forced 0.04 increments)\n* Lack of transparency: unless you were very familiar with reading and understanding Ethereum transactions, hashes, input data and block explorers, it was quite complex to know what was happening on-chain.\n* Lack of DeFi composability: [per Jonny Huxtable](https://medium.com/linkpool/staking-app-v2-and-token-migration-9b3d1672cd45) [11], “the importance of composability became dramatically apparent. That’s why we’ve since rebuilt the token and platform from the ground up to provide a staking ecosystem that’s not just for us but the entire Chainlink node ecosystem across multiple blockchain networks in a fully composable manner.”\n\n## Tokenomics\n\nThe LPL token supply is fixed at 100,000,000, of which at least [25,000,000 are currently available to the general public (see: Distribution)](https://talk.linkpool.io/t/what-are-linkpool-tokens-how-did-everything-start/27) [14]. [According to on-chain data](https://etherscan.io/token/0x89B641464E82697ADfc6CCcbF52b93a89B791E1F#balances) [15], at least 71,450,000 LPL are currently owned and staked by LinkPool at time of posting (based on a rate of 1 linkLPLA to 1 LPL staked). 15 LP (375,000 LPL) are owned as severance by former Head of Operations and co-founder Mat Beale. [These particular tokens are fully locked until September 1, 2021](https://talk.linkpool.io/t/linkpool-operational-update/77) [16]. Some of the available supply is still dependent upon holders of the previous token migrating to the ERC-20 token. At time of posting, [3960.08 out of 4000 LP have been migrated](https://app.linkpool.io/migrate) [17] to LPL (at the rate of 1 LP to 25,000 LPL, this is 99,002,000 LPL).\n\nThe contract with the highest concentration of LinkPool tokens is the [LinkPool Owners’ Pool](https://app.linkpool.io/pools/linkpool-owners/info) [18] (the Staking Contract); at time of post this is [around 97,000,000](https://etherscan.io/address/0x0aA3d1c7838e20790A196d56899fE0Bc8B23700F) [19]. At time of writing, the BNT-LPL pool is the [fourth largest](https://etherscan.io/token/0x99295f1141d58a99e939f7be6bbe734916a875b8#balances) [20].\n\nLinkPool tokens (LPL) serve two purposes:\n\n1. By staking LPL in the LinkPool Owners’ Pool the user is entitled to claim a proportionate share of the fees generated by the [company’s services (see: Monetization: Products & Services)](https://talk.linkpool.io/t/what-are-linkpool-tokens-how-did-everything-start/27) [14]. Rewards are distributed as derivative tokens (lpoLINK), and a user’s lpoLINK balance will automatically increment as their LINK rewards accrue (at current rates of LINK earned, this is estimated to be around once every 12 hours). A user only needs to pay gas once to swap their lpoLINK balance for LINK, which can be exchanged 1:1 at any time. APY is calculated as: APY = (User’s Staked LPL Amount / Total Staked LPL Amount) x Total Fees generated by LinkPool. Users can estimate how much LINK LinkPool’s node is earning by checking its [metrics](https://market.link/nodes/eaa65e96-c498-4af6-a682-47ff9951f75f?network=1) [21] on Chainlink Market.\n2. After staking LPL into the Owners’ Pool, the user will also receive LinkPool Allowance tokens which provide access to future staking pools. The first of these tokens is [linkLPLA](https://etherscan.io/address/0x89B641464E82697ADfc6CCcbF52b93a89B791E1F) [22]. linkLPLA tokens will proportionally determine the amount of LINK a user will be able to stake in the LinkPool platform once Chainlink staking goes live. Initial estimates indicate that 1 linkLPLA will allow a user to stake 0.4 LINK, but these limits will progressively increase as LINK collateral demand grows.\n\n## Community and Communication\n\nOfficial announcements are made via the official [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/linkpoolio) [23] account and [Medium](https://www.medium.com/Linkpool) [24] page. LinkPool has an active community presence on Telegram (two channels: one [official channel](https://t.me/linkpoolio) [25] and an [unofficial group](https://t.me/linkpoolunofficial) [26]) and [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/LinkPool/) [27], as well as a [Discourse Forum](https://talk.linkpool.io/) [28]. LinkPool also operates official channels related to Chainlink Market ([Twitter](https://twitter.com/chainlinkmarket) [29]; [Telegram](https://t.me/chainlinkmarket) [30]). The team’s activity on [Github](https://github.com/linkpoolio) [31] is also frequent with new updates. [The development team and advisors](https://www.linkpool.io/#team) [32] are presented on the official website. Jonny Huxtable is the Co-founder and technical lead of the company. LinkPool can be reached at contact@linkpool.io.\n\n## Token Security\n\nLPL presents no apparent security concerns that would prohibit a whitelisted status. LPL does not have an elastic supply or rebase mechanism. LinkPool contracts do not have permissions that grant administrators unrestricted mint/burn capabilities.\n\n## Available Audits\n\nOn March 11, 2020, [LinkPool stated that](https://www.reddit.com/r/LinkPool/comments/fgz71m/linkpool_faq/) [33] “Audits have been performed, including an audit by [Audits.dev](https://audits.dev/), Thomas Hodges’ Smart Contract auditing project. Additional audits will be announced as time goes on.” (Thomas Hodges is a Lead Integration Engineer at Chainlink Labs.)\n\n## Market and Trading Data\n\n* LPL price at the time of posting is $X.XX.\n* All-time high: $22.24 (27 March 2021)\n* All-time low: $4.38 (26 March 2021)\n* 100,000,000 maximum supply.\n* LPL is currently trading on Bancor, Uniswap, and Bilaxy.\n* The 24-hour spot volumes between Bancor and Uniswap have historically ranged from $603,096 to $4,630,516.\n* Since inception of the ERC-20 token, LPL has consistently been a top pool on Bancor in both liquidity and volume among protected and non-protected pools alike.\n\n\n",

      "content": "[Read the original proposal on Discourse](https://gov.bancor.network/t/proposal-whitelist-beyond-finance-byn/1839)\n\n### This proposal is expected to appear on Snapshot by/on April 26th 12:00PM UTC.\n# TL;DR\n* Proposal to whitelist BYN for v2.1\n* There are no apparent security concerns that would prohibit whitelist status.\n* There is no reason to doubt the legitimacy of the Beyond project.\nCore team members are actively interacting with community & investors via AMA and announcements etc. Token contracts, tech developments are audited and disclosed with transparency. Core decision making process is executed by the DAO process through BIPs (Beyond Improvement Proposals).\n* The benefit to Bancor is clear. Integration with Beyond will open the possibility for future synthetic asset pools in various traditional asset classes, such as equities, fixed income, forex, commodities and derivatives.\n\nBYN token address: 0x4Bb3205bf648B7F59EF90Dee0F1B62F6116Bc7ca\n\nProject Website:[ beyondfinance.io](https://beyondfinance.io/)\n\n# Project\n\nBeyond Finance is a synthetic asset trading platform, which brings investment opportunities for traditional financial assets to everyone, in providing a permissionless financial service eco-system leveraging on blockchain infrastructure.\n\nBeyond Finance provides a seamless and user-friendly service to become a true exchange with competitive UI/UX and implementation of gamification function to compensate some part of the trading fee, in which users feel EASY and INTERESTING to trade.\n\nBeyond will adopt Layer 2 solution to achieve enhanced scalability (Initially, it will be launched with an on-off chain hybrid roll-up solution, and it will migrate to fully-operational Layer 2 solution once its safety and security is guaranteed).\n\n# vs. Existing Synthetic Asset Platforms\n\nBelow are key differences between existing synthetic asset trading platforms.\n\n1. Existing synthetic asset platform has its functions all scattered in different domains vs. Beyond has all functions in one single domain (beyondtrade.io) for better convenience and more intuitive UI\n2. Existing platforms tend to use crypto/blockchain jargons such as Mint/Burn, but Beyond uses easier terms (i.e. Invest/Redeem) so that anyone can understand and easily use => critical to achieve mass adoptions\n3. Existing platforms tend to have high collateralization ratio for minting (up to 500~700%) vs. Beyond has 150~300% (with orderly liquidation mechanism).\n4. Beyond Finance transparently discloses details of debt pool\n5. Beyond adopts gamification functions and broader-based asset classes for trading\n6. Many of Beyond Finance team members are from traditional finance (Investment banks & Asset management companies) and have in-depth knowledge on various asset classes\n7. These differentiating factors and mass-adoption oriented service design will help bring traffic, transaction to the platform and lead to sustainability of the project in the longer-term.\n\n# Token Security\n\nBYN does not have an elastic supply, or rebase mechanism. The Beyond contracts do not have permissions that grant administrators unrestricted mint/burn capabilities. The BYN token ERC_20 has been audited by CERTIK and confirmed with its security.\n\nAudit, Custody and Security\n\nBeyond BYN has been audited at least 1 times since 2021, by reputable auditors:\n\nCertik BYN Token Audit byn210413_3.sol BYN ERC-20 compliant audit completed.

      "content": "[Read the original proposal on Discourse](https://gov.bancor.network/t/proposal-to-whitelist-woo/1854)\n\n# BancorDAO Whitelist Wootrade Network WOO Proposal\n\nThis proposal is expected to appear on Snapshot for voting on Monday 27 April 2020 at 12:00 pm UTC\n\n## TL;DR\n\n* Proposal to whitelist Wootrade Network’s native token WOO.\n* There are no apparent security concerns that would prohibit whitelist status.\n* There is no reason to doubt the legitimacy of the Wootrade project. The team is identified and features Kronos Research co-founders Mark and Jack with funding from top VCs including Dragonfly Capital and Three Arrows Capital.\n* The benefit to Bancor is clear. Integration with Wootrade can open the possibility to, among others, bring some of its trading volume to Bancor and integrate a liquidity providing solution on Bancor through the Wootrade platform.\n\nWOO token address: 0x4691937a7508860f876c9c0a2a617e7d9e945d4b\n\nProject Website: https://woo.trade/\n\n## Token Security\n\nWOO does not have an elastic supply, or rebase mechanism. The Wootrade ERC-20 contracts do not have permissions that grant administrators unrestricted mint/burn capabilities. WOO is a capped-supply token with a total supply of 3 billion tokens and circulating supply of 432,413,779.00 WOO. The contracts and addresses with the highest concentration (top 10 and >1% of circulating supply) of WOO tokens are the token vesting contracts, one Huobi wallet, one Bitmax wallet, team wallets and a wallet with 1.86%.\n\n![|602x235](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/bancordao/optimized/1X/2f50cc8bc981525f9432da31d76777346e6a916c_2_602x235.png)\n\n## Project\n\nWootrade is a layer one darkpool trading platform infrastructure complete with deep liquidity, frontend trading GUI, and the ability to integrate into any exchange, trading desk, wallet, dApp, or other trading-related platform. Wootrade is able to leverage rebates from high volume institutional traders and market makers, giving the retail traders and B2B clients high-depth, zero-fee trading.\n\nWootrade aims to solve the liquidity, cost, and adverse selection issues of cryptocurrency trading for exchanges, institutions, and (eventually) retail traders through the use of redesigned incentive mechanics around the WOO token.\n\n## Tokenomics\n\nWootrade launched its mainnet on October 30, 2020 with 3 billion WOO tokens created at genesis. 20% was sold at private sale with vesting between six months and two years. 20% is reserved for the team, with vesting between six months and four years. 5% is reserved for advisors, vested over 4 years. 50% of the supply is reserved for ecosystem rewards.\n\nWOO tokens (ERC-20) are bought back and burned each month with portions of revenue amassed on Wootrade. It will be utilized in the decentralized governance of Wootrade, and unlocks access to zero-fee trading for the institutional and retail users on the Wootrade network.\n\n* WOO can be amassed by users and B2B clients to apply for reduced, zero, or even negative fees on the platform.\n* WOO can be used as collateral on Wootrade to trade spot / futures.\n* WOO entitles users to receive fee discounts on Kronos Research asset management products.\n* WOO will serve as a method of capturing value from numerous DeFi applications\n* WOO governance framework will involve staking tokens to accrue voting points.\n\n## Community and Communication\n\nWootrade is active on [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wootrade/) and [Telegram](https://t.me/wootrade). The Wootrade team also operates official [Twitter](https://twitter.com/wootraderS), [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/wootrade/?hl=en), [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/Wootrade), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/wootrade/about/) and [Medium](https://wootrade.medium.com/) accounts. Github activity is limited to the [Wootrade documentation](https://kronosresearch.github.io/wootrade-documents), with activity since 27th August, 2019. The [development team](https://woo.trade/team) is presented on the Wootrade website. The team integrates Kronos Research co-founders Jack Tan and Mark Pimentel.\n\nThe team's official e-mail contact is admin@woo.network.\n\n## Available Audits\n\nThe WOO ERC-20 token contract is a standard OpenZepelling contract. The Wootrade contracts have not been audited yet. \n\n## Market and Trading Data\n\n* WOO’s price at the time of writing is $0.7310.\n* All-time high: $1.10 (16th April 2021).\n* All-time low: $0.02211546 (4th January, 2021).\n* Price 90 days ago: $0.024814.\n* 376,235,705 tokens in circulation.\n* 3,000,000,000 maximum supply.\n* The current market capitalization is $278,902,173.\n* The WOO token is available on major exchanges, including Uniswap, Sushiswap, Huobi Global, Gate.io, Bitmax and Bitmart.\n* The 24-hour spot volumes range from $92,217 (Gate.io) to $11,287,288 (Bitmart).

Not your money.  ICHI turns $64B parasitic relationship scarce crypto coins have with stablecoins into a mutually beneficial one.  Every project can now have their own oneToken (ICHI stablecoin) that is minted with that community's scarce crypto + a fiat-backed stablecoin. For example, you must buy BNT to mint oneBNT (a hypothetical Bancor oneToken). You can use these oneTokens to buy or sell goods and services, pay expenses and taxes, or to create USD exposure in DeFi (decentralized finance) applications.\n\noneTokens provide the hard peg of centralized stablecoins without sacrificing decentralization nor giving up on the underlying asset.\n\noneTokens keep their value at $1, are purely on-chain, and accrue a community treasury in each oneToken's cryptocurrency.\n\n**Let’s simplify the story.** Typically, when you want to make a trade and get out of your favorite asset to ‘get stable’, you need to trade out of your favorite asset into a stablecoin. Now you’re in an either/or scenario. Whether USDT, USDC, DAI, these other stablecoins capture value for themselves and not for your favorite crypto asset. Remember, you just sold it to get stable. \n\n**Enter ICHI.** With ICHI, you can have your cake and eat it too. \n\nBy minting a oneToken - oneBNT for example - and not selling into another stablecoin, ICHI not only puts upward price pressure on BNT, but also grows a community treasury that YOU govern and control. \nYou pay in member coins to mint a coin's stablecoin. These coins remain in a community treasury because you only get back USDC when you redeem the coin's stablecoins. The coin's community decides what to do with this treasury by voting with the stablecoin itself. A common action may include selling part of the community treasury to buy more USDC and deposit it back into the stablecoin's USDC collateral. \n\n![image|690x354](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/bancordao/optimized/1X/0d1313d01c334df1994376579879ee995132e9aa_2_690x354.png) \n\n# Tokenomics\n* [5,000,000 ICHI were minted - additional minting is impossible](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x9b1e9353dca3301faa911b5073c751a8195c66c4bdfa2d34ddc7b9ba1c3c385d) (11/13/2020)\n  * ICHI token contract has no owner and no governance\n  * No way to generate new ICHI tokens\n* 56% of tokens in circulation\n* ICHI pays its core team in ICHI-BNT LP tokens\n* 100% fair launch, no pre-sale, no initial team cut\n* ICHI is currently distributed at base rate of 0.5 ICHI per block to liquidity providers\n* ICHI halvings distribute the dwindling supply of ICHI without ceasing liquidity rewards\n* ICHI’s next halving: May 8th, 2021\n\n# Community and Communication\nLearn more by visiting the [ICHI website](https://www.ichi.org/), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ichifarm), or [Telegram](https://t.me/ichifarm).

      "title": "Increase Co-investment Limit to 750K BNT on RSR (Reserve Rights Token) Pool",
      "content": "[Read the original proposal on Discourse](https://gov.bancor.network/t/proposal-increase-co-investment-limit-to-750k-bnt-on-rsr-reserve-rights-token-pool/1827)\n\n**TLDR**\n\n* This proposal seeks to increase the Co-investment limit to 750K BNT in the RSR pool.\n* It will open up space for LPs on the TKN side (RSR) and potentially lead to an increase in the depth of the pool as LPs add liquidity\n* A larger RSR pool will attract more trades from aggregators and professional market makers to Bancor which ultimately leads to more fees for our platform.\n\n**Abstract**\nThere is currently ~85.6K BNT and ~6.5M RSR tokens in the BNT-RSR [pool](https://etherscan.io/address/0x4a0737d8a87c9ffc31adf85d578339d5c7a5270d). This has resulted in a pool that has roughly ~1.1M in liquidity. At the moment, LPs on the TKN side (RSR) can’t provide single sided liquidity since there is no capacity. This proposal is seeking to increase single-sided capacity in the RSR pool by increasing the Co-investment limit to 750K BNT.\n\n**Motivation**\n\nIf we want to attract more RSR LPs to Bancor, we need to open up space in the pool so that they can provide single sided liquidity. This would allow us to grow the liquidity in the pool and attract larger trades towards our platform which ultimately results in higher fees for Bancor.\n\nThe RSR-BNT pool data shows that it was roughly filled up completely from December-January with a slow draw down in liquidity towards the latter half of January and beginning of February. It has since remained relatively stable for the past few weeks but it hasn't grown as there hasn't been space to provide single sided deposits:\n\n![image|690x232](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/bancordao/optimized/1X/456e4d46874b9772f47c8b7db4acf32c5d1e56ed_2_690x232.png) \n\nThis suggest to me that there is demand for LPs on the RSR side to provide liquidity and we should open up space from our side.\n\nThe top pool for RSR is on Uniswap (not much on other DEXes) and it is paired with ETH. We should strive to make the Bancor pool deeper to support larger trades (equates to lower slippage).\n\n![image|690x314](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/bancordao/optimized/1X/bef25b107fd396176f0d1908966afc88b011d546_2_690x314.jpeg) \n\nCurrently, this pool is filled completely on Bancor and LPs can’t provide single sided liquidity on the TKN side (RSR). I am proposing a 750K Co-investment limit for the RSR pool which should open up roughly 5.2M in single sided liquidity (assuming BNT price at $7.00). If this pools fills up completely, we would have a pool that’s roughly ~10.5M in depth. Our pool will also be competing with CEXes that also have large amounts of RSR\n\n![image|269x483](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/bancordao/original/1X/b6ce51319332c08277cc392ff2e95308b033dd9b.png) \n\nIf we attract RSR LPs and grow the pool to its full capacity, we will roughly have ~58.9M in RSR tokens (assuming price of $0.089 for RSR) which would put us in the ~3th place among CEXes.\n\n**For**\n\n1. A larger co-investment limit on the pool will let LPs provided single sided liquidity and will lead to an increase in pool depth\n2. More liquidity in the RSR-BNT pool should lead to larger volume from DEX aggregators and professional market makers sent in our direction\n3. More volume for Bancor leads to more fees for our platform and BNT holders\n\n**Against**\n\n1. We should not increase the limit on the pool\n2. We do not need extra liquidity in our platform to support larger trades\n3. We do not need to generate fees for our platform or BNT holders",

      "content": "[Read the original proposal on Discourse](https://gov.bancor.network/t/proposal-to-whitelist-zcn-bnt-with-20k-bnt-co-investment-limit/1850/2)\n\n# The following text has been truncated due to Snapshot's character limit.\n \n0Chain (ZCN)\nToken contract address: 0xb9EF770B6A5e12E45983C5D80545258aA38F3B78\nProject website:[ https://0chain.net/ ](https://0chain.net/)\n\n# TL;DR\n\n* 0Chain is a decentralized data storage network, and introduces an out-of-the-box, data regulation-compliant product set to disrupt a $1T industry.\n* The ZCN token is locked in exchange for cloud storage access.\n* The initial seed investors and team’s token vesting, representing 20% of the fully diluted token supply, has been linearly vested over 4 years (2018-2021). The single greatest private holder of ZCN has approx. 1% of the total ZCN supply.\n* There are no obvious exploits that could affect the Bancor Network, vis-a-vis developer rug pulls, or whale price manipulation games.\n* There is an existing, active liquidity provider community lying in wait, ready to move liquidity to Bancor at the first opportunity. The proposed co-investment limit allows ample space for Bancor to absorb the lion’s share of the total DEX liquidity, while maintaining a substantive incentive for ZCN LPs to buy and stake BNT to increase the pool depth thereafter.\n\n# Discussion\n\n0Chain is a layer-1 enterprise grade Decentralized Storage Network (DSN) with built-in proxy re-encryption allowing for public / private sharing of data. It adopts erasure coding (data fragmentation) technology instead of file replication to achieve security, availability and geo diversity of data. This in turn allows for companies to comply with GDPR/CCPA regulations, as data access is only possible by the data owner or entities that he or she delegates access to all the while whilst maintaining control on data fragment geography should such a business or regulatory need arise without data bloat.\n\n# Tokenomics\n\nStorage Consumers, aka Clients, can lock tokens and obtain cloud storage in return. Storage Providers, aka Blobbers, can stake ZCN and earn yield on their stake plus a service fee on data written / read by the Clients. ZCN holders can also delegate their ZCN to Blobbers, and earn a yield on their stake plus a percentage of the Blobber’s revenue. Such delegation enables further scalability of the 0Chain storage network by allowing Blobbers who can provide the adequate storage hardware but do not have the required ZCN tokens to join the storage network.\n\nUltimately, the ZCN token value is directly correlated to the amount of data stored on, and read from, the Blobber’s storage network; and thus in turn to the amount of tokens staked by Blobbers (and delegators) for availing such storage capacity. [4]\n\n0Chain decouples this storage network from consensus, which is handled by a different set of service providers. The active consensus set is made up of 100 Miners and 25 Sharders, and is shuffled every 7 days. Miners are responsible for producing blocks and Sharders are responsible for storing blocks. This active set behaves as a control layer for the storage network, facilitating handshakes between Clients and Blobbers amongst other things.\n\n0Chain decouples consensus and storage at the infrastructure layer and couples them at the economics layer albeit via different reward mechanisms; however are all ultimately token centric. This allows for a fast, scalable and lean network that is not resource intensive nor one that constrains or favors any one aspect or group over another.\n\n# Github | 17 Pub. Repos , 200+ Branches\n\n0Chain is a project which has been in development for the last three (3) years. This development went through a two-pronged process of research, third party review, and eventually code implementation.\n\nCutting edge research was done in collaboration with researchers from San Jose State University, University of Maryland, Indian Institute of Technology Madras, and Imperial College of London. Whitepapers are available 0Chain’s website [1].\n\nCode implementation over 3 years and ongoing, 17 active public repositories, 200+ branches, and more than 3000+ commits, is available on Github [9]. The code is production ready and available for download.\n\n![](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/bancordao/optimized/1X/69ff4e3b7472b88cccaf436962b39202a9cf9b4c_2_690x404.jpeg)\n\n# Community and Communication\n\nThe 0Chain community is a large proponent of DeFI, so much that the community independently crowdsourced its liquidity through a smart contract: a “Geyser” [5] that functions in a very similar manner to Bancor’s Liquidity Mining reward protocol.\n\n![image|569x404](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/bancordao/original/1X/81a7e824a1b4de046c7b5d9b44bf21f5b92fe0ef.png) \n\nThe Geyser issues a reward multiplier that increases over time as the liquidity position remains staked. Today, the Geyser currently holds over $700,000 in dual sided liquidity from community members. Since the liquidity on 0Chain’s Geyser is dual sided, it exposes the 0Chain community to IL and is a risk they happily take. However, a whitelisted ZCN on the Bancor Network would see the Geyser liquidity replicated on its Bancor pool, since it enables IL protections that Uniswap cannot, removing the risk and thus increasing staking incentives.\n\n0Chain has an active Telegram, Twitter, Newsletter and Facebook. There are two official chats: the main chat (general and tech related questions), and a “Service Provider” chat (questions related to Mining / Sharding / Blobbing).\n\nThere are several articles on Medium regarding updates, partnerships, and tech. You can also find us on Youtube, Facebook and Reddit.\n\nThe founders, Saswata Basu and Tom Austin, have 15+ years experience operating in Silicon Valley. Saswata has founded several successful startups, with previous experience at Nortel, Harris, and Intel. Tom currently teaches Computer Science at SJSU, with previous experience at Cloudflare and Mozilla [7]. The core team has more than 20 developers.\n\n# Market Data\n\nMax total supply: 400,000,000 (50% is mineable - block & interest rewards)\n\nFDV: USD $278,246,575 [8]\n\nCirculating supply: 139,123,287.67* (69.5% of minted tokens) [8]\n\n24h trading volume: USD 2.5M+ [9]\n\nExchanges: Uniswap, [Gate.io](http://gate.io/), Bitfinex, Bilaxy, Bancor, Wanswap\n\nDistribution: 25,000 ERC20 addresses.\n\n![image|690x424](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/bancordao/optimized/1X/01ce094d0541935e1f1e6f91b80ef26ae0ab5487_2_690x424.png) \n\n# Token Distribution\n\nMax Cap is 400 Million. 50% mineable and 50% pre-mint. Overall, the token distribution on a fully diluted basis is as follows:\n\n50% Asymp. declining emission over >50 years for BLOCK and Interest rewards. Block Emissions is 10.5 mil tokens in the first year of Mainnet and declines 10% yoy. Interest rewards emission is dependent on how many tokens are staked and locked by blobbers and clients respectively.\n\n10% Reserve for partnerships and development. Reserves unlock on a trigger of 90 days sustained token price of $10 per token or more. Once unlocked, reserves vest thereafter at a rate of 1% over 10 years.\n\n10% Network Security and incentives for data acquisition.\n\n15% Team [Vests linearly over 4 years 2018-2021]\n\n10% Community Sale [2018]\n\n5% Seed investors and advisors [Vests linearly over 4 years 2018-2021]\n\n# Co-Investment\n\nWe seek a co-investment of 20,000 BNT and whitelisting of ZCN for IL protection at this stage. We believe Uniswap has limited the interest from LPs due to IL as is apparent from our liquidity profile below.\n\n1. At the hype of Uniswap our total liquidity increased to $4 million. Unfortunately this growth was interrupted, as LPs soon realized that IL is a serious issue and have proceeded to downsize their positions or leave completely.\n\n![image|690x329](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/bancordao/optimized/1X/502584c3019180efec04827449fb58da49f10976_2_690x329.jpeg) \n\n[UniSwap Liquidity Profile History]\n\n2. Moreover, our volume has room to increase with our liquidity as is evident from our UniSwap volume profile history.\n\n![image|690x355](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/bancordao/optimized/1X/032328968df4da5c1683952531102a2861497007_2_690x355.jpeg) \n\n[UniSwap Volume Profile History]\n\n3. The number of transactions on ZCN today is clearly dominated by Uniswap as shown by data from etherscan below. We believe there is ample share for our nascent and recent Bancor pool to grab here.\n\n![](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/bancordao/optimized/1X/148298484ed06e4885d0220e0ed6cb0ba9cf13b7_2_690x453.jpeg)\n\n\n",

      "content": "[Read the original proposal on Discourse](https://gov.bancor.network/t/proposal-whitelist-rendoge-150k-bnt-co-investment/1791)\n\n**Proposal to Whitelist renDOGE with a co-investment limit of 150k BNT**\n\nContract Address: 0x3832d2F059E55934220881F831bE501D180671A7\n\nProject Website: https://renproject.io/\n\nProject Documentation: https://renproject.io/renvm\n\nProposed Co-Investment Limit: 150,000 BNT.\n\n# Discussion\n\nAs we know Doge has taken the internet by storm -- the actual Doge coin is not a compatible ERC-20 token. The REN Project has a currently ERC-20 compatible DOGE token, which acts as a \"mimic\" accurately reflecting the current price of Doge. The principle is the same as \"wrapping\" Bitcoin. renDOGE is pegged to a 1:1 ratio of the actual Doge coin. Bringing the renDOGE to the BNT platform with added Liquidity mining can be an educational / awareness test run to shed light on the Bancor Protocol and the use case of Defi. ***We could have first movers advantage on DOGE via DEFI***\n\n# Project\n\nThe Doge coin was started as a \"meme\" to provide users the ability to have a free and instant and cheap way to be able to transact with one another, also to draw a positive light on crypto currencies. Doge is a fork of bitcoin. Doge coin was written in C++ just like bitcoin. \n\n# Tokenomics\n\nDoge coin is currently mined by users (Proof-of-work) with a block reward of 10,000 DOGE, Doge is an inflationary currency unlike bitcoin. Dogecoin's current block time is approximately 1 minute. Significantly faster than bitcoin's 10 minute block time.\n\n# Community and Communication\n\nThis is where the DOGE coin shines, and where it can bring great awareness to DEFI and the Bancor network. Millions of mentions across all social media platforms (Facebook, Twitter, Reddit, Discord, Twitch and TikTok) the exposure we could potentially have would be worth the Co-Investment provided by the protocol alone. There was a proposal to allocate a portion of all fees to marketing efforts, I think this could serve just as well if not more. The connection between Bancor and Doge would be one giant marketing push in it of itself for Bancor. Capitalizing on the Doge Coin community would could be our silver bullet. Elon musk has repeatedly mentioned DOGE coin and how it is his favorite coin \"a coin for the people.\" Doge Coin socials have been on a consistent uptrend, and show no signs of slowing down -- the community is immense. Potentially millions of people -- arguably the most powerful community in all of crypto currency. A truly diverse community.\n\n![image|690x243](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/bancordao/optimized/1X/60334b28ef7d49d79fe598c2bed6acb0bbb4a01a_2_690x243.png) \n\n![image|690x180](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/bancordao/optimized/1X/5d46531b4080804c866cb14c2f41f85cead238cf_2_690x180.png) \n\n![image|690x173](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/bancordao/optimized/1X/e25bdf4087ecf15bb1f51cb2113adbe370fe467d_2_690x173.png) \n\n![image|690x167](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/bancordao/optimized/1X/483e5f2c99f9ae97d0e4b8e79be6f812a7f2e51d_2_690x167.png) \n\n![image|690x170](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/bancordao/optimized/1X/2246c772cfc497d6869d626eb13942cfd019fb62_2_690x170.png) \n\n![image|690x153](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/bancordao/optimized/1X/b75f70fe7ca76ac423beb2ce90d7809a750fe054_2_690x153.png) \n\n![image|619x103](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/bancordao/original/1X/576f79f768de0aeb25207045a55df8e0d7d053c8.png) \n\n![image|643x115](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/bancordao/original/1X/e3cc24c00bcc71fa34ec15e4540202ebbe639cd4.png)\n\n# Market and Trading Data\n\n**Below listed for the volume for Doge coin itself**\n**Although renDOGE has siginificantly less volume, it shouldn't serve as much because the whole point is to raise awareness to both platforms**\n**Capturing 1% of all volume would equate to $430586732.29**\n\n* Doge Coins price at the time of writing is $0.3393\n* All-time high: $0.4377 Apr 16, 2021 (6 hours ago)\n* All-time low: $0.00008547 May 07, 2015 (6 years ago)\n* Price 90 days ago: $0.007294\n* 129,210,007,256 tokens in circulation\n* The current market capitalization is $43,058,673,229\n* The Doge token is available on major exchanges, including Binance, FTX, Kraken, Huobi Global, and Robinhood\n* The 24 hour volumes range from $66,385,961,661",

Cloud-Native allows Ankr to focus on its own technical details via integrating with various Cloud-Native solutions such as Observability & Analysis (Prometheus, Fluentd, Jaeger), Service Mesh and Discovery (Envoy, Istio), Streaming (GRPC), Application Definition (Helm) etc.\n\nUsing Ankr’s distributed cloud computing network (DCCN) platform, developers and operators using applications do not directly interact with infrastructure providers’ API’s. Instead, a local orchestrator handles resource allocation automatically. The Ankr DCCN system is deployed and distributed over the computing resources managed by Kubernetes across all geographic locations. Resources configured into clusters in Kubernetes are connected to each other via a specialized type of cluster called Ankr Hub.

      "content": "[Read the original proposal on Discourse](https://gov.bancor.network/t/proposal-whitelist-the-iexec-rlc-token/684)\n\niExec RLC token contract address: 0x607F4C5BB672230e8672085532f7e901544a7375\n\n[Project website](https://iex.ec/ )\n\n# TL:DR Summary:\n\niExec is a decentralized protocol allowing for the buying and selling of computing resources in a fully decentralized way. Since 2017, the iExec project has been building a marketplace for cloud computing resources - servers, datasets, and applications. Anyone can buy and sell computing resources in exchange for the native iExec utility token ‘RLC’. Additional features of the iExec protocol allow for confidential computing, NFT asset tokenization of computing resources, secure decentralized oracles (secured using TEE), and much more!\n\n# Project Generic Description:\n\niExec has developed the first decentralized marketplace for cloud computing resources. Blockchain is used to organize a market network where users can monetize their computing power, applications, and datasets. By providing on-demand access to cloud computing resources, iExec supports compute-intensive applications in fields such as AI, big data, healthcare, rendering, or FinTech.\n\nThe iExec network is made up of computing resource providers. Computing power providers are called ‘iExec Workers’. As workers, users can connect their machines and be rewarded in RLC tokens for contributing resources to the network. Application providers can monetize their applications and algorithms. Data providers who own valuable datasets can make them available for use by applications through iExec. The iExec consensus protocol ‘PoCo’ (Proof of Contribution) provides consensus over off-chain computing and can also be used to integrate decentralized oracles with iExec.\n\nOne of the main strengths of iExec lies in trusted off-chain computing. Its representative heads the ‘Trusted Compute Working’ group within the Ethereum Enterprise Alliance. It has partnered with Intel to release a ‘trusted compute’ solution for blockchain (TEE using Intel SGX). Other iExec collaborators include Alibaba Cloud, IBM, Genesis Cloud, EDF electrical utility company, EEA, and Ubisoft. iExec was one of the contributors to the Trusted Compute Framework (Hyperledger Avalon) alongside Microsoft, Intel, ConsenSys, Envision, PegaSys, and Kaleido.\n\niExec is working with various organizations and consortiums to provide scalable, secure and easy access to the services, datasets, and computing resources.\n\nThe ‘RLC’ utility token:\n\n‘RLC’ is the native token to iExec. RLC are ERC-20 standard tokens. The RLC is a utility token, used to buy and sell resources provided through iExec. On the iExec Marketplace, it is the sole method of payment between application providers, server providers and data providers. Anyone can earn RLC tokens by trading these computing resources on the iExec marketplace. As the iExec network is fully decentralized, no single agent is trusted by default, and that those agents require incentives to contribute correctly.The RLC token is ‘staked’ as a security deposit, in iExec’s consensus protocol ‘Proof-of-Contribution (PoCo)’ is the protocol used by iExec for consensus over off-chain computing.\n\nThe iExec team is active and interacts with the community on various discussion channels such as [Telegram](https://t.me/iexec_discussion), [Slac](https://slack.iex.ec/), [Kakao Talk](https://open.kakao.com/o/gKyp9Mw), WeChat. The iExec team also runs various communications channels such as the iExec [Twitter](https://twitter.com/iEx_ec), the iExec [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/c/iExec) channel, the [iExec Blog](https://medium.com/iex-ec), the [‘iExec Academy](https://academy.iex.ec/) (content and tutorial aggregator), and the [Adoption Roadmap](https://trello.com/b/oSCT5z09/iexec-adoption-roadmap).\n\niExec Smart Contract and middleware developments can be viewed on [Github](http://ub.com/iExecBlockchainComputing).\n\nDetails of iExec executive, development, and business teams can be seen on the [‘About Us’](https://iex.ec/about-us/) page of the iExec website.\n\n[Video: iExec 2-minute Introduction:](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IESv4BNw8Q) \n[iExec: The Decentralized Future of Cloud Computing - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IESv4BNw8Q)",

Users are able to lend stablecoins (for now just TUSD, but shortly USDC and other tokens) to TrueFi and earn a 10%+ yield on their deposits. Borrowers are diligenced and approved by governance to be able to borrow without collateral requirements. TrueFi will also be launching an on-chain credit score that other protocols will be able to utilize in an effort to improve credit efficiency throughout DeFi.\n\n# Tokenonmics\nTrueFi’s token, TRU is used for both governance and staking on the platform. TRU stakers deposit TRU into the protocol’s staking contract and are credited with stkTRU (currently, about 30% of circulating supply is being staked) which can be used for governance and approving loans. In the case of a default, stakers stand to lose a portion of their staked TRU. Stakers are also entitled to all fees generated by the protocol.\n\n# Community and Communication\nTrueFi is active on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/TrustToken), [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/3tMyMqyqDj), and [Telegram](https://t.me/jointruefi).\n\n# Available Audits\nAll audits can be found publicly on our [Github page](https://github.com/trusttoken/audits/tree/master/TrueFi).\n\n# Market and Trading Data\n* ATH was $0.615301 (Feb 13, 2021)\n* ATL was $0.108493 (Nov 26, 2020)\n* Max supply of 1,442,485,442.37835615\n* TRU is available on SushiSwap and Uniswap (currently incentivizing liquidity on Uniswap and will soon be shifting that over to Sushiswap)\n* [Coingecko](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/truefi)",

      "content": "[Read the original proposal on Discourse](https://gov.bancor.network/t/proposal-increase-co-investment-limit-to-2m-bnt-on-bat-basic-attention-token-pool/1766)\n\n# TL;DR\n\n* This proposal seeks to increase the Co-investment limit to 2M BNT in the BAT pool.\n* It will open up space for LPs on the TKN side (BAT) and potentially lead to an increase in the depth of the pool as LPs add liquidity\n* A larger BAT pool will attract more trades from aggregators and professional market makers to Bancor which ultimately leads to more fees for our platform.\n\n# Abstract\nThere is currently 120.1K BNT and 567.8K BAT tokens in the BNT-BAT [pool](https://etherscan.io/address/0xd72e360Eb08B36450849dc533edC1B8dB1Bd6D91). This has resulted in a pool that has roughly 1.7M in liquidity. At the moment, LPs on the TKN side (BAT) can’t provide single sided liquidity since there is no capacity. This proposal is seeking to increase single-sided capacity in the BAT pool by increasing the Co-investment limit to 2M BNT.\n\n# Motivation\n\nIf we want to attract more BAT LPs to Bancor, we need to open up space in the pool so that they can provide single sided liquidity. This would allow us to grow the liquidity in the pool and attract larger trades towards our platform which ultimately results in higher fees for Bancor.\n\nSince inception, the BAT-BNT pool data shows that is filled up completely by the seventh week (2020-11-23):\n\n![](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/bancordao/optimized/1X/13e9ea38adf39dacc66153e12a22e921e280c651_2_689x187.png)\n\nThis suggest to me that there is demand for LPs on the BAT side to provide liquidity and we should open up space from our side.\n\nThe top pools for BAT are on Uniswap/Balancer and are paired with ETH. Cumulative liquidity is roughly 14.75M on other DEXes and we should strive to make the Bancor pool deeper to support larger trades (equates to lower slippage).\n\n![](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/bancordao/original/1X/32bb3da9f272ea30c7b4b53000f3349a25e8f768.png)\n\nCurrently, this pool is filled completely on Bancor and LPs can’t provide single sided liquidity on the TKN side (BAT). I am proposing a 2M Co-investment limit for the BAT pool which should open up roughly 14M in single sided liquidity (assuming BNT price at $7.00). If this pools fills up completely, we would have a pool that’s roughly ~28M in depth. Our pool will also be competing with CEXes that also have large amounts of BAT.\n\n![](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/bancordao/original/1X/165f2154dc1ad8e5c0e28599b2559af35de56663.png)\n\nIf we attract BAT LPs and grow the pool to its full capacity, we will roughly have ~9M in BAT tokens which would put us in the 9th place among CEXes.\n\n*For*\n\n1. A larger co-investment limit on the pool will let LPs provided single sided liquidity and will lead to an increase in pool depth.\n1. More liquidity in the BAT-BNT pool should lead to larger volume from DEX aggregators and professional market makers sent in our direction.\n1. More volume for Bancor leads to more fees for our platform and BNT holders.\n\n*Against*\n\n1. We should not increase the limit on the pool.\n1. We do not need extra liquidity in our platform to support larger trades.\n1. We do not need to generate fees for our platform or BNT holders.",

      "content": "# TL;DR\n* Proposal to activate liquidity mining on MPH\n* Proposal to coinvest on the MPH pool 350,000 BNT\n\n# Justification\nOur first proposal on Bancor to [whitelist MPH](https://gov.bancor.network/t/proposal-for-whitelisting-mph/1600) received [unanimous support](https://twitter.com/MBRichardson87/status/1377093167921520641) from vBNT holders in our respective communities that helped us reach the required quorum in a short period of time.\n\nThis was truly heartwarming and we decided to airdrop a special [“Thank you” NFT](https://twitter.com/88mphapp/status/1381183649769533441/video/1) to the 123 Bancorians who voted for it.\n\nIn our opinion, what we witnessed during the whitelisting proposal vote is illustrating a strong synergy between our communities to create additional value in both ecosystems.\n\nFrom one side, you have MPH HODLers with a fervent desire to stake more MPH and BNT in order to create the single deepest source of MPH liquidity in the DeFi space.\n\nOn the other side, there is the Bancor community who incentivizes key pools for strategic reasons with co-investments and LM rewards, while making sure the whole point is not just farming-and-dumping BNT rewards and creating useless inflationary emissions.\n\nThis and all the recent events around our whitelisting have two, equally important impacts on Bancor Network:\n\n* TVL growth. A 350k coinvestment in association with a liquidity mining rewards would create a significant incentive to migrate in a short period of time the whole Uniswap liquidity ([$6m](https://info.uniswap.org/pair/0x4d96369002fc5b9687ee924d458a7e5baa5df34e)) to the current MPH pool on Bancor ([$400k](https://app.bancor.network/eth/data)). Roughly, this coinvestment will support $2.5m in MPH single-sided availability, totalizing a $5m depth. With the addition of the LM rewards, more single-sided exposure opens up with the BNT re-staked, and the MPH Bancor pool will definitely become larger than the Uniswap one.\n* Price Support. While the 88mph and Bancor communities become thoroughly intertwined, the core supporters of Bancor and 88mph will make sure that the BNT rewards remain off the open market, and inside the Bancor Network, guaranteeing that BNT token price is not affected in any way. According to the recent data, the core-behavior of the LPs is to restake 80% of the rewards. There is no reason this should be different with the 88mph community looking for a capital-efficient solution.\n* Sustainable revenues: growing the depth of the pool will further strengthen its attractiveness and encourage an equal or larger amount of volume, and by consequence a sustainable stream of income for the LPs, while enjoying IL protection. A great way to keep them incentivized in the long term even if the LM rewards dry out at some point.\nThanks for reading.\n\n*Disclaimer: I’m the cofounder of 88mph and I own some $MPH.*\n\nNot yet familiar with 88mph?

      "content": "[Read the original proposal on Discourse](https://gov.bancor.network/t/proposal-increase-co-investment-limit-to-1m-bnt-on-amp-pool/1767)\n\n# TL;DR\n\n* This proposal seeks to increase the Co-investment limit to 1M BNT in the AMP pool.\n* It will open up space for LPs on the TKN side (AMP) and potentially lead to an increase in the depth of the pool as LPs add liquidity\n* A larger AMP pool will attract more trades from aggregators and professional market makers to Bancor which ultimately leads to more fees for our platform.\n\n# Abstract\nThere is currently ~41.9K BNT and ~9M AMP tokens in the BNT-AMP [pool](https://etherscan.io/address/0x0F4a8a06C22Ba49e98d15223A701062c40873F7a). This has resulted in a pool that has roughly $611K in liquidity. At the moment, LPs on the TKN side (AMP) can’t provide single sided liquidity since there is no capacity. This proposal is seeking to increase single-sided capacity in the AMP pool by increasing the Co-investment limit to 1M BNT.\n\n# Motivation\n\nIf we want to attract more AMP LPs to Bancor, we need to open up space in the pool so that they can provide single sided liquidity. This would allow us to grow the liquidity in the pool and attract larger trades towards our platform which ultimately results in higher fees for Bancor.\n\nSince inception, the AMP-BNT pool data shows that it has been in high demand and has filled up completely during certain intervals:\n\n![](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/bancordao/optimized/1X/2f7e3df1faa8323ff82ba7487509a3c15f3e972d_2_690x233.png)\n\nThis suggest to me that there is demand for LPs on the AMP side to provide liquidity and we should open up space from our side.\n\nThe top pools for AMP are on Uniswap/Balancer/Sushiswap and are paired with ETH/USDC. Cumulative liquidity is roughly 9.39M on other DEXes and we should strive to make the Bancor pool deeper to support larger trades (equates to lower slippage).\n\n![](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/bancordao/original/1X/f81ac1e7caf00742fbb9195a1d2057f41ea056c9.png)\n\nCurrently, this pool is filled completely on Bancor and LPs can’t provide single sided liquidity on the TKN side (AMP). I am proposing a 1M Co-investment limit for the AMP pool which should open up roughly 7M in single sided liquidity (assuming BNT price at $7.00). If this pools fills up completely, we would have a pool that’s roughly ~14M in depth.\n\nThis pool won’t have too much competition from CEXes since most of the liquidity resides on DEXes\n\n![](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/bancordao/original/1X/d226b5c5f0bd59f63fce66c726d2b752ed293690.png)\n\nNote that this pool was whitelisted in [Proposal: Whitelist AMP-BNT pool](https://gov.bancor.network/t/proposal-whitelist-amp-bnt-pool/539)\n\n*For*\n1. A larger co-investment limit on the pool will let LPs provided single sided liquidity and will lead to an increase in pool depth\n1. More liquidity in the AMP-BNT pool should lead to larger volume from DEX aggregators and professional market makers sent in our direction\n1. More volume for Bancor leads to more fees for our platform and BNT holders\n\n*Against*\n\n1. We should not increase the limit on the pool\n1. We do not need extra liquidity in our platform to support larger trades\n1. We do not need to generate fees for our platform or BNT holders",

The mStable DAO recently proposed to deploy circa US$5 million into a 50/50 Uniswap MTA/DAI pool which was later ratified by Meta governors in a vote.\n* In addition, the [Uniswap MTA/WETH pool](https://info.uniswap.org/pair/0x0d0d65e7a7db277d3e0f5e1676325e75f3340455) has $7.4m in liquidity (938,588 MTA + 1480 ETH), with a 24-hour trading volume of $3.7m.\n* An MTA/BNT liquidity pool has also been whitelisted on Bancor offering single-sided liquidity and impermanent loss protection. It currently has a liquidity depth of $62k.\n* Bancor’s phenomenal growth and launch of single-sided liquidity pools with impermanent loss protection has definitely caught the interest of the mStable community, as it offers a superior value proposition through a HODL + LP strategy while simultaneously offering impermanent loss protection\n* This proposal is seeking to increase single-sided capacity in the MTA pool by increasing the Co-investment limit to 1M BNT, and the mStableDAO is keen to seed US$1m in initial liquidity in MTA.\n* Further down the line, there is an opportunity to divert some MTA in staking contracts (~US$33m) into this liquidity pool.\n\n# Motivation\n\n* Uniswap is the primary DEX for facilitating MTA trades, with liquidity routing through the MTA/ETH pair.\n* We believe there is a huge potential to attract MTA LPs to Bancor given Bancor’s unique impermanent loss protection which offers MTA holders the ability to offer single-sided liquidity.\n* We require the help of Bancor’s governance to open up space for more MTA LPs to provide single-sided liquidity, attracting larger trades on Bancor and accruing higher swap fees to the platform.\n\n![](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/bancordao/optimized/1X/9897bd526206dae4414ad29f76061c4159d2c7bc_2_690x353.jpeg)",

      "content": "[Read the original proposal on Discourse](https://gov.bancor.network/t/proposal-for-250k-coinvestment-lm-rewards-on-ndx/1803)\n\n# TL;DR\n* Proposal to activate liquidity mining on NDX\n* Proposal to co-invest on the NDX pool 250,000 BNT\n\n![](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/bancordao/optimized/1X/de08825fa1d2b45716d8ebbe7ff6c6dbd877b27f_2_624x379.jpeg)\n\n# Justification\nOur first proposal on Bancor to [whitelist NDX](https://gov.bancor.network/t/proposals-to-whitelist-index-tokens-and-governance-token-ndx/1546) received [unanimous support](https://vote.bancor.network/#/bancornetwork.eth/proposal/QmRXjcdPUTuK7ouNgWsFw9ySEYESjrLmVu7T6mvgb4prn4) from vBNT holders that helped us reach the required quorum in a short period of time. Our other indices got approved as well but due to an upgradability pattern they don’t meet Bancor’s security standards at this point (we’re working on it).\n\nIn the meantime, we want to focus on deepening the liquidity for the NDX pool on Bancor and make it the premier place to buy NDX.\n\nFrom what we gathered by talking to our community, there is a strong alignment in values and desire to work more closely together. Some of our community members were already $BNT holders, others heard about the IL-protection for the first time and were thrilled by the opportunity to provide liquidity.\n\nAs a matter of fact, the $NDX space that was available in the pool was filled up within minutes after the pool was deployed.\n\nWe now want to bootstrap the pool and bring it to a level on par with Uniswap to kickstart the sophisticated tokenomic flywheel created by Bancor. Right now the liquidity on Uniswap is 4x the liquidity on Bancor, so Bancor is not the default place to buy NDX and liquidity providers miss out on fees.\n\nWith a larger co-investment and liquidity mining there is no rationale why several liquidity providers on Uniswap would not migrate to Bancor. I, myself am a large liquidity provider in the NDX pool on Uniswap (and on Bancor) and would certainly move my liquidity to Bancor.\n\nWe are aware that the Bancor community who incentivizes key pools for strategic reasons with co-investments and LM rewards, is concerned about it leading to farming-and-dumping of BNT rewards and creating useless inflationary emissions.\n\nI can say from my own experience of being a Bancor LP that I don’t see this as a possibility. This co-investment would roughly open-up $1,917,000 in NDX single-sided liquidity, totaling close to $4m in total depth. This would make the Bancor pool the deepest NDX pool overnight and with the liquidity mining rewards being re-staked, the liquidity would continue to grow over time.\n\nAccording to the recent data, LPs on Bancor restake 80% of the rewards. There is no reason this should be different with the NDX community looking for a capital-efficient solution. Moreover, having the deepest liquidity, the pool would also receive more volume than the Uniswap pool, creating a sustainable revenue stream of income for LPs if the LM rewards were to stop at some point.\n\nI love to see the rapprochement of the Bancor community and Molly M&A (Hegic, MPH and NDX) project and see this as the next step.\n\n[Documentation and Materials](https://docs.indexed.finance/)\n[Q2 Roadmap](https://ndxfi.medium.com/q1-retrospective-and-whats-ahead-for-q2-43f4667e648)\n[A comparison of Index projects](https://cryptotesters.com/review/comparing-defi-index-projects)\n[Interview with Dillon Kellar](https://defiprime.com/indexed-finance)",

Simply said, we allow users to bridge over their crypto assets onto the Ethereum ecosystem using a “wrapped” token method.\nCompared to other similar solutions in the market (wBTC, renBTC), our solution is significantly more permissionless, decentralised and thus safer to the user.\n\n# Features\n1. Safe: Multi-signature and BOR Tunnels provide a double guarantee of assets.\n1. Fast: oToken can be minted/redeemed within several minutes.\n1. Permissionless: User friendly, anyone can freely use BoringDAO protocol.\n1. One-click: Non-ERC20 token can be easily converted to oToken with just one click.\n1. Decentralised: BoringDAO runs in a fully decentralized way.\n1. DAO governance: The community members are the real controllers of BoringDAO.\n1. Boring tunnel mechanism (“wrapped token mechanism”)\n1. For each blockchain asset, there will be an exclusive minting tunnel operated in the form of DAO and performing bi-directional mapping between blockchain assets and tokens.\n\nEach oToken (eg oBTC) is backed by 100%+ assets and thus very safe:\n\n* Asset layer: 100% original crypto asset (eg. BTC)\n* Contract Layer: 25% - 150% $ETH, $BOR, $DAI, etc. over collateral\n* Application Layer: Insurance protocol ( Eg. Cover)\n\n![](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/bancordao/optimized/1X/4722e9da72c25b4e569a6c86c27a1a72c766f30d_2_690x342.jpeg)\n\n# Tokenomics\nBOR is the governance token & utility token of the BoringDAO ecosystem. BOR tokens are currently used (1) as collateral to secure the boring tunnel, and (2) as governance voting.\n\nTotal supply: 200,000 BOR.\nBOR tokens are designed to be fairly distributed to the community members over time (60% of supply) through Mint mining and BoringFarm.\n\n# Community and Communication\nBoringDAO started in August 2020. Since launching, we have been very fortunate. Our community growth has been rapid and we very quickly found ourselves deeply entrenched in the DeFi community.\n\nYou can find our presence in every major DeFi vertical, such as money market, DEXs, asset management, insurance. We have recently expanded beyond Ethereum, having cross deployed our protocol in BSC, and OKex chain. Currently, BOR token is traded in CEXs such as Huobi and [Gate.io](http://gate.io/).\n\n![](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/bancordao/optimized/1X/f2e59d2c92984746e06cf98c2d5dc63cd340d2b5_2_690x405.jpeg)\n\nThe Boring community which is so called ⽆聊社区 are active on Telegram, WeChat, Weibo, Discord, and forum . The BoringDAO team is a distributed and community-based team with about 10 core team members, mainly based in Taipei, Beijing, Shanghai and Cambridge. We originate from BTC miners and various yield farming communities, and we trust Bitcoin and DeFi can change the world with no doubt.\n\nTVL: USD 96m\noBTC: 771 minted.\noLTC: 23500 minted.\nTwitter: 6200 followers.\n\n# Available Audits\n[PeckShield](https://github.com/peckshield/publications/blob/master/audit_reports/PeckShield-Audit-Report) has completed the BoringDAO smart contracts audit.\n\n# Market and Trading Data\nBoringDAO’s price at the time of writing is $975.66. It’s all-time high was $975.66 (Mar 29, 2021), and its all-time low was $92.43 (Nov 16, 2020). There are 83,349 tokens in circulation, of a 200,000 maximum supply. The current market capitalization is $81,334,920. The BOR token is available on major exchanges, including Huobi Global, Gate.io and MXC. The 24-hour spot vol umes range from $2,672,537 (Huobi Global) to $36,628 (Gate.io).\n",

      "content": "[Read the original proposal on gov.bancor.network](https://gov.bancor.network/t/proposal-increase-co-investment-limit-to-2m-bnt-on-mkr-pool/1689)\n# TL;DR\n* This proposal seeks to increase the Co-investment limit to 2M BNT in the MKR pool.\n* It will open up space for LPs on the TKN side (MKR) and potentially increase the depth of the pool as LPs add liquidity\n* A larger MKR pool will attract more trades from aggregators and professional market makers to Bancor which ultimately leads to more fees for our platform.\n\n# Abstract\nThere is currently 78.6K BNT and 256.8 MKR tokens in the BNT-MKR [pool](https://etherscan.io/address/0x2131C84dA69b879Cb505BFd9aBaaAf5ec8b6e83b). This has resulted in a pool that has roughly 1.2M in liquidity. At the moment, LPs on the TKN side (MKR) can’t provide single sided liquidity since there is no capacity. This proposal is seeking to increase single-sided capacity in the MKR pool by increasing the Co-investment limit to 2M BNT.\n\n# Motivation\nIf we want to attract more MKR LPs to Bancor, we need to open up space in the pool so that they can provide single sided liquidity. This would allow us to grow the liquidity in the pool and attract larger trades towards our platform which ultimately results in higher fees for Bancor.\n\nThe top 4 pools cumulative liquidity for MKR-ETH pairs in other platforms (Uniswap/Sushiswap/Balancer) roughly totals 84.12M.\n\n![](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/bancordao/original/1X/946a2bf6489f0ad4f8b1498e30299d9d6d586d55.png)\n\nCurrently, this pool is filled completely on Bancor and LPs can’t provide single sided liquidity on the TKN side (MKR). I am proposing a 2M Co-investment limit for the MKR pool which should open up roughly 14M in single sided liquidity (assuming BNT price at $7.00). If this pools fills up completely, we would have a pool that’s roughly ~30M in depth and potentially make us the largest DEX for MKR (if we move LPs from other platforms over).\n\nThe MKR-BNT pool data shows that it has been filled completely since last year (notice the 200 MKR token threshold):\n![](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/bancordao/optimized/1X/7ee22e6ce76fecc2831e23080f9b240b1696008d_2_690x162.png)\n\nThis suggest to me that there is demand for LPs on the MKR side to provide liquidity since it hits its threshold when 2.1 launched back in October and has stay at these levels since then (~200 MKR tokens).\n\n# For\n\n1. A larger co-investment limit on the pool will let LPs provided single sided liquidity and will lead to an increase in pool depth\n1. More liquidity in the MKR-BNT pool should lead to larger volume from DEX aggregators and professional market makers sent in our direction\n1. More volume for Bancor leads to more fees for our platform and BNT holders\n\n# Against\n\n1. We should not increase the limit on the pool.",

The ANKR is backed by tier one team and has no plans to mint more tokens. The current token supply is set on\n\n10,000,000,000 fixed supply from which 6,996,232,711 are in current circulation.\n\nThe contracts and addresses with the highest concentration of ANKR are held by the ANKR team and sit on the exchanges.\n\n![](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/bancordao/original/1X/ba2b4f6a7e2934f1444483988de01ebff16e9c16.png)\n\nProject:\nAnkr uses Cloud-Native, container-based environments to build its own architectural and resource allocation algorithm to include nearly all types of infrastructure resources. Cloud-Native allows Ankr to focus on its own technical details via integrating with various Cloud-Native solutions such as Observability & Analysis (Prometheus, Fluentd, Jaeger), Service Mesh and Discovery (Envoy, Istio), Streaming (GRPC), Application Definition (Helm) etc.\n\nUsing Ankr’s distributed cloud computing network (DCCN) platform, developers and operators using applications do not directly interact with infrastructure providers’ API’s. Instead, a local orchestrator handles resource allocation automatically. The Ankr DCCN system is deployed and distributed over the computing resources managed by Kubernetes across all geographic locations. Resources configured into clusters in Kubernetes are connected to each other via a specialized type of cluster called Ankr Hub. At this time Ankr Hubs are fully set up and controlled by Ankr and serve as nodes to relay and dispatch the computing tasks to other working clusters.\n\nWorking products:\nAnkr - A World Powered by US 1 - open API https://app.ankr.com/apps/api \n\nAnkr - A World Powered by US - deploy node or maining facility https://www.ankr.com/product \n\nAnkr Web 3.0 infrastructure | Blockchain nodes & APIs | Ankr 1 - calulaor https://www.ankr.com/product \n\nhttps://eth2.ankr.com/ - eth 2.0 staking  https://eth2.ankr.com/ \n\nTokenomics:\nAnkr tokens are used as the native currency on the Ankr cloud platform. That means cloud providers are being paid for their services in Ankr tokens. This ensures demand for the token. Consumers have to buy Ankr tokens in order to use the platform. Providers have to accept them in order to participate and earn money. There is no a possibility for investors to stake Ankr tokens yet. Therefor bancor would be the best place to stka ANKR tokens. In addition to that, Ankr tokens are being used as governance tokens to decide on future tokens development.\n\nInvestors:\n * Pantera Capital\n * AlphaCoin Fund\n * Basics fund\n * Bixin Capital\n * BlockoxFund\n * Carnaby Capital\n * Sailor Capital\n * DHVC\n * GT Blockchain Investments\n * Kosmos Capital\n * LinkVc\n * Lemniscap\n * LYVC\n * Node Capital\n * Nirvana Capital\n * OK Capital\n * Tenzor Capital LLC\n * TLDR CAPITAL\n * Torchlight Ventures\n * Lemniscap\n * MW Partners\n\nTeam:\n * CEO -Chandler Song, Forbes 30 under 30 engineering and investing experience (3 years) in the company for 2 years \n\n * CTO - Stanley W. prior Amazon software developer, lack of prior leadership exp, 1year in comp \n\n * COO - Ryan Fang Forbes 30 under 30 Investment Banking Analyst experience, lack of leadership exp, 2 years in comp \n\nOverall 38 employees\n\nCommunity and Communication\nANKR is active on:\nReddit  - https://www.reddit.com/r/Ankrofficial/\nTelegram -https://t.me/ankrnetwork\nDiscord - https://discord.com/invite/uYaNu23Ww7\nTwitter - https://twitter.com/ankr?lang=en\nGitHub - https://github.com/Ankr-network\nThe team and advisors are presented on the team tab on the Ankr main website - https://www.ankr.com/about-team \n\nAvailable Audits:\nThere is only one public audit provided by ANKR that covers ETH2.0 staking contract, it did not cover ANKR token itself.\n\nBeosin 10.11.2020 https://assets.ankr.com/files/stkr_smart_contract_auditing_report.pdf \n\n\nMarket and Trading Data:\n * ANKR price at the time of writing is $0.51\n * All-time high: $0.21 (Mar 28, 2021 )\n * All-time low: $0.0007 (Mar 13, 2020 )\n * Price 90 days ago: $0.0007\n * 6,996,232,711tokens in circulation\n * 10,000,000,000 maximum supply.\n * The current market capitalization is $1,079,903,605\n * Token Fully Diluted market Capitalization is around $2,100,000,000\n * The ANK token is available on major exchanges, including Binance, Kraken, \n * Huobi Bithumb, and Coinbase Pro.\n * The highest 24-hour spot volume on CEX is on Biannce around $74 M and on DEX 700K on Uniswap.",

      "content": "[Original Proposal](https://gov.bancor.network/t/lm-rewards-for-maker-mkr/1638)\n\nProposal to add mid cap LM rewards to MKR Pool.\n\n# TL;DR\n\n* MakerDAO is one of the oldest projects in the DeFi space.\n* The MakerDAO community is risk adverse and Bancor should be a good fit for their users.\n* DAI is the oldest & largest algorithmic stablecoin and by building a relationship with the Maker community, they could potentially reciprocate and onboard BNT as a collateral type to the Maker Protocol in the future.\n\nToken contract address:\n[0x9f8f72aa9304c8b593d555f12ef6589cc3a579a2](https://etherscan.io/token/0x9f8f72aa9304c8b593d555f12ef6589cc3a579a2)\n\n[Project website](https://makerdao.com/)\n[Whitepaper](https://makerdao.com/en/whitepaper) \n\n# Discussion\n\nThe Maker protocol is an open-source project started in 2014 with the goal of creating a permissionless credit system that would allow users to take out loans collateralized by cryptocurrency. These loans are created by smart contracts that mint [Dai](https://messari.io/asset/dai), a stablecoin with a soft peg to the US dollar. The protocol was built by the Maker Foundation along with a number of outside parties and over time the foundation has worked to reduce its level of control. They have gradually ceded control to a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) known as MakerDAO which governs the protocol. The DAO is comprised of individuals across the globe that own the MKR token which affords holders the right to vote on important changes.\n\n# Staking\nCurrently, MakerDAO does not support staking for the Maker token (or as a collateral type). One of the few ways to utilize the token is by providing liquidity to protocols such as AAVE (0.04% Past 30 day Avg. APY). Neither Compound or CREAM list it as an asset that you can lend.\n\nIf we incentivize the MKR/BNT pool on Bancor protocol then this should be the most attractive option for MKR holders.\n\n# Tokenomics & Token Metrics\n\nMKR is the governance token and recapitalization source of the Maker Protocol. As a governance token, MKR is used by its holders to vote on a number of different things. The token also acts as a source of recapitalization when the Maker Protocol runs at a deficit.\n\nThe primary responsibility of MKR holders is to ensure the stability of the Dai Peg and the overall health of the Maker Protocol. It is also in MKR holders’ interest to focus on improving and growing the Maker Protocol by building out the governance processes and infrastructure that enable the effective management of the system. This includes, but is not limited to,\n\n* Establishing risk assessment standards for onboarding new Collateral and Vault types.\n* Ratifying role mandates and electing appropriate parties.\n* Establishing standards around vote types.\n* There were a total of 1,000,000 MKR at the inception of the Maker  Protocol. The current supply is roughly ~995,238.77 (see [etherscan](https://etherscan.io/token/0x9f8f72aa9304c8b593d555f12ef6589cc3a579a2)).\n\nThe total number of MKR in existence can fluctuate based on how the system runs. For instance, the total supply of MKR can increase if the system is running a deficit and needs to dilute MKR as a recapitalization source. If the system is governed well, the total amount of MKR will decrease as MKR is destroyed in exchange for excess Dai from the system’s surplus.\n\n# Community and Communication\n\n[Twitter](https://twitter.com/MakerDAO)\n124.8K Followers\n\n[Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/MakerDAO/)\n23446 readers\n\n[Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4jqZlzQHUhzqf5rMd5ywTw)\n2.67K subscribers\n\n[Telegram](https://t.me/makerdaoOfficial)\n7457 Members\n\n\nThe MakerDAO community has a large user following that has shown significant growth these past few months.

The majority of MKR currently resides on DEXes with Uniswap/Sushiswap/Balancer leading the pack followed by CEXes (Binance, Huobi, OKex)\n\n![](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/bancordao/optimized/1X/d0a706e1e1faf6323c2c3ec6733a0697fa821042_2_230x500.png) \n\nBy far, the four largest pairs are MKR/ETH with Uniswap/Sushiswap having the deepest pools:\n\n![](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/bancordao/original/1X/6d28c1d9b9f01857cfe15d7f8907d0674ecbf66f.png)\n\nWith LM incentives from our end, I think that we could easily become the deepest pool for the MKR token.\n\nVolume wise, the daily average for the last 30 days on the top three pools have done roughly ~3.8M in combine volume:\n\n![](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/bancordao/original/1X/074a8e898f30f618582e9a577d7e636231d46d6a.png)\n\nIn the DeFi space the MakerDAO protocol is consistently ranked in the top 10 by TVL in its platform:\n\n![](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/bancordao/optimized/1X/5749501aa9785a4ae80f860415960519d38d7ba8_2_690x342.jpeg)\n\n\nThe MakerDAO project is one of the oldest in the DeFi space and has been around since 2014. SCD (single collateral dai) was launched in 12/17 and was later succeeded by MCD (multi collateral dai). The DAI stablecoin has played an important role in DeFi and currently has a 3B Supply.\n\nThe MakerDAO community tends to be very risk adverse and I think that Bancor has a chance to capture their users over to our platform since we are more attractive (single sided liquidity, IL protection) than other AMMs. If we start building a relationship with the MakerDAO community then potentially in the future they might reciprocate and onboard BNT as a collateral type to the Maker Protocol.\n\n# References\n[CoinGecko, MKR](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/maker)\n[CoinGecko, DAI](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/dai)\n[Maker (MKR) Token Tracker](https://etherscan.io/token/0x9f8f72aa9304c8b593d555f12ef6589cc3a579a2)\n[Dai (DAI) Token Tracker](https://etherscan.io/token/0x6b175474e89094c44da98b954eedeac495271d0f)\nhttps://info.uniswap.org/pair/0x72ef722d2a6c3b72e6113b6f3f1c62c75aa152e5\nhttps://sushiswap.vision/pair/0xba13afecda9beb75de5c56bbaf696b880a5a50dd\nhttps://pools.balancer.exchange/#/pool/0x9866772a9bdb4dc9d2c5a4753e8658b8b0ca1fc3/\nhttps://pools.balancer.exchange/#/pool/0x987d7cc04652710b74fff380403f5c02f82e290a/\nhttps://makerburn.com/#/rundown\nhttps://makerdao.com/en/whitepaper\nhttps://awesome.makerdao.com/#audits-or-security-1\n[community-development.makerdao.com](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/faqs/mkr-token/)\n[messari.io MKR](https://messari.io/asset/maker)\n[messari.io DAI](https://messari.io/asset/dai)\nhttps://twitter.com/MakerDAO\n[reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/MakerDAO/)\n[YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4jqZlzQHUhzqf5rMd5ywTw)\n[Telegram](https://t.me/makerdaoOfficial)\nhttps://defillama.com/protocol/makerdao",

      "content": "[Original Proposal](https://gov.bancor.network/t/proposal-to-whitelist-nftp/1656)\n\n# VOTES ON THIS PROPOSAL ARE SPECIFIC TO NFTP\n\nThis proposal is part of the general proposal to whitelist Indexed Finance indices. The parent document can be found [here](https://gov.bancor.network/t/proposals-to-whitelist-index-tokens-and-governance-token-ndx/).\n\nNFTP is our most recent index. Since it was only launched last week I couldn’t include it when I first published the parent document.\n\nLike DEGEN, NFTP is an index originating from our Sigma Program aimed at deploying new indices at faster pace and without going through governance. The Sigma committee is a 3 / 5 Gnosis multi-sig that can deploy new indices and allocate rewards for their staking pools. The signers were [elected by the community.](https://forum.indexed.finance/t/sigma-committee-nominations-thread/102/23)\n\nThe NFTP Index tracks a broad category of projects in the NFT, Metaverse and community token space. Importantly, it’s not including actual NFT art or collectibles but governance tokens of NFT platforms. As such, there are no illiquidity concerns and the NFTP index follows the same architecture as DEGEN.\n\nCandidate members have circulating market capitalisations ranging from US$50 million to US$5 billion.If any constituent tokens fall out of these bounds, they are replaced via periodic re-indexing by the largest market cap tokens drawn from a list of alternatives. In this way, the index will constantly evolve to capture upside from tokens during their most rapid growth phases.\n\n* Enjin, $2.3B, 24h trading volume: $417,121,457($ENJ)\n* Decentraland $1.3B, 24h trading volume: $379,815,670 ($MANA)\n* Sand $512m, 24h trading volume: $105,367,314 ($SAND)\n* SuperFarm $327m, 24h trading volume: $60,589,691 ($SUPER)\n* Audius $475m, 24h trading volume: $80,003,395($AUDIO)\n* Axie Infinity $300m, 24h trading volume: $60,777,010 ($AXS)\n* Ethernity $352m, 24h trading volume: $9,583,742 ($ERN)\n* Gala $178m, 24h trading volume: $616,508 ($GALA)\n* Rarible $117m, 24h trading volume: $13,549,074 ($RARI)\n* NFTX $83m, 24h trading volume: $1,217,195($NFTX)\n\n# How does NFTP work?\nLike all core indices the underlying tokens represented by the NFTP tokens sit in a liquidity pool and re-balance automatically based on the market caps of the underlying tokens. A controller contract fetches the market capitalization of each token from a Uniswap price oracle and submits new target weights to the index pool based on a capitalization-rooted weighting algorithm.\n\nNFTP tokens are actually LP tokens that represent a share in the AMM pool. They can be redeemed at all times against the underlying tokens in the pool or sold on a decentralized exchange provided there is sufficient liquidity.\n\nThe only difference between Sigma indices and core indices is that they have a circuit breaker mechanism. The committee can enable and disable swaps between assets in the NFTP pool via a ‘circuit breaker’ in the event of a vulnerability in one of the constituent tokens. This is to protect the pool from being drained if one token goes to zero. Swaps being disabled don’t freeze anything: this just prevents weightings from being adjusted towards target weightings. Holders can still burn NFTP tokens back to their underlyings if the circuit breaker is enabled.\n\nDEGEN contract address: [0x68bb81b3f67f7aab5fd1390ecb0b8e1a806f2465](https://etherscan.io/token/0x68bb81b3f67f7aab5fd1390ecb0b8e1a806f2465)\n\n# Security\nThe Index Pool contract is a fork of the [Balancer Pool](https://github.com/balancer-labs/balancer-core/blob/master/contracts/BPool.sol). The primary changes made to the contract were to enable more dynamic pool management so that assets can be bound, rebound and reweighed gradually and without the need to access external liquidity.\n\nThese changes have been audited by two independent security experts: Daniel Luca, a former auditor for Consensys diligence, and Mudit Gupta, the lead blockchain engineer at Polymath.\n\n[Daniel Luca Audit](https://github.com/monoceros-alpha/audit-indexed-finance-2020-10)\n[Mudit Gupta](https://github.com/maxsam4/indexed-finance-review)\n\n# Volume & Fees\n* DEGEN market cap: $7.4m\n* TVL in the DEFI5 pool: $1.2m\n* 24h volume: $77K\n* 24h fees: $232\n\n![](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/bancordao/optimized/1X/50f38030189dbb104b5030ae4220e2158558915b_2_624x384.jpeg)",

In this way, the index will constantly evolve to capture upside from tokens during their most rapid growth phases.\n\nIt consists of smaller cap token projects which have more growth potential but also more financial risk.\n\n* RUNE ($1.2b), 24h trading volume:$51,636,331\n\n* REN ($4.5b), 24h trading volume: $341,614,509\n\n* RSR ($1b), 24h trading volume: $341,614,509\n\n* CRV ($656m), 24h trading volume: $143,302,744\n\n* 1nch ($636m), 24h trading volume: $289,894,692\n\n* OCEAN ($615), 24h trading volume: $183,133,749\n\n* ALPHA ($481m), 24h trading volume: $179,327,526\n\n* BADGER ($297m), 24h trading volume: $34,776,763\n\n* POLS ($240m), 24h trading volume: $80,034,989\n\n* MIR ($350m), 24h trading volume: $22,914,635\n\n# How does DEGEN work?\nLike all core indices the underlying tokens represented by the DEGEN tokens sit in a liquidity pool and re-balance automatically based on the market caps of the underlying tokens. A controller contract fetches the market capitalization of each token from a Uniswap price oracle and submits new target weights to the index pool based on a capitalization-rooted weighting algorithm.\n\nDEGEN tokens are actually LP tokens that represent a share in the AMM pool. They can be redeemed at all times against the underlying tokens in the pool or sold on a decentralized exchange provided there is sufficient liquidity.\n\nThe only difference between Sigma indices and core indices is that they have a circuit breaker mechanism. The committee can enable and disable swaps between assets in the [DEGEN](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24DEGEN&src=cashtag_click) pool via a ‘circuit breaker’ in the event of a vulnerability in one of the constituent tokens. This is to protect the pool from being drained if one token goes to zero. Swaps being disabled don’t freeze anything: this just prevents weightings from being adjusted towards target weightings. Holders can still burn [DEGEN](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24DEGEN&src=cashtag_click) tokens back to their underlyings if the circuit breaker is enabled.\n\nDEGEN contract address: [0x126c121f99e1e211df2e5f8de2d96fa36647c855](https://etherscan.io/token/0x126c121f99e1e211df2e5f8de2d96fa36647c855)\n\n# Security\nThe Index Pool contract is a fork of the [Balancer Pool](https://github.com/balancer-labs/balancer-core/blob/master/contracts/BPool.sol).

I’m Lito from [Indexed Finance](http://indexed.finance/). I have become a big fan of Bancor over the last couple of months as I dived deep into Bancor V2.1 and got to know the team. I even interviewed Nate and Mark for my [Cryptotesters podcast](https://cryptotesters.com/podcast/bancor) recently.\n\nAs a Bancor enthusiast and an Indexed Finance core team member I naturally want to see these two projects develop a relationship and explore partnership possibilities.\n\nBelow is my proposal to whitelist our core indices DEFI5, CC10, ORCL5 as well as our Sigma index DEGEN (soon NFT index) and our governance token NDX.\n\nWe are suggesting the default co-investment of 20,000 $BNT per pool.\n\nI am aware that pushing multiple tokens in a single proposal is generally frowned upon. Therefore, the purpose of this document is to organize and summarize the overall value proposition to Bancor and its community; however, each token will be submitted separately for a DAO decision.\n\nTo maintain a strong sense of cohesion, and to assist discussion between BancorDAO members, this parent document can be treated as a central beacon for general comments and questions. I will prepare separate posts on the governance forum for each token, and invite your specific comments and criticisms on those as well.\n\nI am super excited to be here, and I very much look forward to working with the DAO on improving these proposals, until they are fit for a final governance decision. Thank you in advance for your attention!\n\n# Links to Token-Specific Documents\n[Proposal to whitelist DEFI5](https://gov.bancor.network/t/proposal-to-whitelist-defi5/1547)\n[Proposal to whitelist CC10](https://gov.bancor.network/t/proposal-to-whitelist-cc10/1548)\n[Proposal to whitelist ORCL5](https://gov.bancor.network/t/proposal-to-whitelist-orcl5/1551)\n[Proposal to whitelist DEGEN](https://gov.bancor.network/t/proposal-to-whitelist-degen/1549)\n[Proposal to whitelist NFTP](https://gov.bancor.network/t/proposal-to-whitelist-nftp/1656)\n\n# About Indexed\nIndexed Finance is a protocol for developing passive portfolio management strategies (a.k.a ETFs). The first product developed by Indexed Finance is a set of capitalization-weighted index pools designed to replicate the behavior of index funds, which historically have [returned better and more consistent returns](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/03/15/active-fund-managers-trail-the-sp-500-for-the-ninth-year-in-a-row-in-triumph-for-indexing.html) than actively managed funds on the stock market.\n\nIndex pools simplify asset management on Ethereum the way that index funds do for the stock market: by creating a single asset which represents ownership in a diverse portfolio that tracks the market sector the index represents. Each index pool has an ERC20 index token which anyone can mint by providing the underlying assets in the pool, burn to claim the underlying assets, or swap with exchanges to easily manage their exposure to specific markets.\n\nOur three core indices are DEFI5 ($18m TVL), CC10 ($10m TVL) and ORCL5 ($400k TVL). We also recently launched DEGEN ($7m TVL as part of our Sigma program aiming at experimenting with new index ideas in a more agile set-up. NFTI, our upcoming NFT index will also be a part of Sigma.\n\nThe core difference between Indexed and something like $DPI (IndexCoop) is that our indices are 100% automated. The tokens sit in AMM liquidity pools and re-balance based on a Uniswap mkt.cap oracle. The DEFI5, CC10 index tokens etc are really just LP tokens representing a share in those AMMs. It also means the assets are constantly generating yield for their holders.\n\nIndex projects have grown tremendously in popularity over the last couple of months. They are especially attractive for crypto beginners/newcomers who don’t have the time to actively manage their portfolio and spend hours researching new projects. By having liquidity for multiple indices tracking various market sectors, Bancor will be a more attractive trading venue for this target group as opposed to ceding them to Uniswap.\n\n# NDX Tokenomics\nNDX (ERC20), is used to vote on proposals formulated by the community through our Snapshot page as well as on-chain. Our DAO is based on the same Governor Alpha contract as Compound. NDX holders can also participate in the governance of Uniswap, Compound (and more in the future) with the UNI and COMP tokens sitting in our index pools.\n\nIn the near future, pending upcoming tokenomics changes, we will be exploring more utility for the governance token such as staking, vote-locking, and more.\n\n![](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/bancordao/optimized/1X/e5343d9e2e16cf2c72b7d9560dfd235152f71a4c_2_690x267.jpeg)\n\nToday, close to a third of the total NDX supply has been distributed to the community via liquidity mining. At the time of writing there are 5252 NDX holders.\n\nThe DAO treasury (address number 2) receives 30% of the supply vested over 9 months starting from March 1st 2021.\n\nThe founder team (address n.3) has 20% of the NDX supply which are vested linearly over 9 months.\n\nMolly Wintermute from Hegic invested into Indexed at an early stage of the project and owns 100,000 NDX tokens or 1% the supply.\n\nOther than Molly there are a couple of whales in the community but no one controls more than 1% of the token supply.\n\n# Volume & Fees\n\n![](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/bancordao/optimized/1X/4fae7b7a7e4418299872e4f936d5046e89a27d03_2_690x428.jpeg)\n\nTVL in the NDX pool: $810k\n24h volume: $366K\n24h fees: $1100\nCommunity and Communication\n\nIndexed Finance is active on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ndxfi), [Discord](https://discord.gg/jaeSTNPNt9), [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdbua6FtaiD0emvvBerKRMw), [Medium](https://ndxfi.medium.com/), [Telegram](http://ndxfi/), and [GitHub](https://github.com/indexed-finance).\n\n# Audits\nThe core contracts have been audited by two independent security experts: Daniel Luca, a former auditor for Consensys diligence, and Mudit Gupta, the lead blockchain engineer at Polymath.\n\n[Daniel Luca Audit](https://github.com/monoceros-alpha/audit-indexed-finance-2020-10)\n[Mudit Gupta](https://github.com/maxsam4/indexed-finance-review)\n\n# Market and Trading Data\n\nNDX at time of writing is $6.97\nAll-time high: $27.71 (Feb 04, 2021)\nAll-time low: $1.01 (Jan 15, 2020)\n3,147,404 tokens in circulation\n10,000,000 supply\n$21,830,061\nNDX is available on Uniswap\n\n# References\n[Documentation and Materials](https://docs.indexed.finance/)\n[A comparison of Index projects](https://cryptotesters.com/review/comparing-defi-index-projects)\n[Interview with Dillon Kellar](https://defiprime.com/indexed-finance)",

      "content": "[Original Proposal](https://gov.bancor.network/t/proposal-to-whitelist-defi5/1547)\n\n# VOTES ON THIS PROPOSAL ARE SPECIFIC TO DEFI5\n\nThis proposal is part of the general proposal to whitelist Indexed Finance indices. The parent document can be found [here](https://gov.bancor.network/t/proposals-to-whitelist-index-tokens-and-governance-token-ndx/1546).\n\nDEFI5 is the flagship product of Indexed Finance with the highest TVL and the best performance across all indices in the DeFi space. Since its launch on December 22nd 2020 DEFI5’s price has increased by over 430%.\n\nIt consists of the Top 5 DeFi projects by market cap namely:\n\n* UNI ($17b), 24h trading volume:$770,422,890\n\n* AAVE ($4.5b), 24h trading volume: $320,593,781\n\n* COMP ($1.7b), 24h trading volume: $90,759,381\n\n* SNX ($2.9b), 24h trading volume: $119,708,097\n\n* CRV ($656m), 24 trading volume: $143,302,744\n\n# How does DEFI5 work?\nDEFI5 assets sit in a liquidity pool and re-balance automatically based on the market caps of the underlying tokens. A controller contract fetches the market capitalization of each token from a Uniswap price oracle and submits new target weights to the index pool based on a capitalization-rooted weighting algorithm.\n\nDEFI5 tokens are actually LP tokens that represent a share in the AMM pool. They can be redeemed at all times against the underlying tokens in the pool or sold on a decentralized exchange provided there is sufficient liquidity.\n\nDEFI5 contract address: [0x86772b1409b61c639eaac9ba0acfbb6e238e5f83](https://etherscan.io/token/0xfa6de2697d59e88ed7fc4dfe5a33dac43565ea41)\n\n![](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/bancordao/optimized/1X/2ae56e2c80a6f8191a8e5205684cf1977a1556d1_2_690x221.png)\n\n# Security\nThe Index Pool contract is a fork of the [Balancer Pool](https://github.com/balancer-labs/balancer-core/blob/master/contracts/BPool.sol). The primary changes made to the contract were to enable more dynamic pool management so that assets can be bound, rebound and reweighed gradually and without the need to access external liquidity.\n\nThese changes have been audited by two independent security experts: Daniel Luca, a former auditor for Consensys diligence, and Mudit Gupta, the lead blockchain engineer at Polymath.\n\n[Daniel Luca Audit](https://github.com/monoceros-alpha/audit-indexed-finance-2020-10)\n[Mudit Gupta](https://github.com/maxsam4/indexed-finance-review)\n\nAlthough DEFI5 doesn’t have a large market cap itself, it represents a basket of the largest and arguably most secure tokens in the entire DEFI space.\n\nApproximately two-thirds of the token supply is spread across the liquidity pool, the rewards contract, and the MATIC network bridge; the largest token holder owns 4.4% of the token supply.\n\n# Volume & Fees\n* DEFI5 market cap: $15m\n* TVL in the DEFI5 pool: $12m\n* 24h volume: $284K\n* 24h fees: $854\n\n![](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/bancordao/optimized/1X/e00409d90daaf22b8a210be0528c1ea46d7de517_2_690x431.jpeg)",

      "content": "Extension of LM rewards plan\n\nStake vBNT for voting on this proposal before Wednesday 31st March, 2021 (UTC)\n\nTL;DR\n\n1. The LM Rewards program will be extended on ETH, LINK, WBTC.\n2. The LM Rewards will be extended on USDC, DAI, USDT.\n3. The current award rates for each pool will be unaffected.\n4. Proposal has been made based on data available publicly via the Bancor Dune analytics page: https://duneanalytics.com/Bancor/bancor_1 \n\nExtension of Liquidity Mining on Current Pools\n The LM rewards schedule for ETH, INK, WBTC, USDC, DAI and USDT is due to end in less than 2 weeks. To maintain liquidity in the near term, and to sustain incentives for new LPs to become involved in the Bancor ecosystem while Bancor prepares new products and upgrades, herein it is proposed to extend the LM rewards program on these pools for a further 8 weeks.\n\n1. ETH, LINK, and WBTC will continue to receive emissions of 100-200K BNT per week, for an additional 8 weeks.\n2. USDC, DAI, and USDT will continue to receive 50-100K BNT per week, for an additional 8 weeks.\n3. The liquidity mining program for USDC, DAI, and USDT can be ended prior to the completion of the 8 week extension if the alternative shadow tokens pool redesign is deployed.\n4. Upon release of the shadow pools, a new LM incentives program may be considered by the DAO. It is a reasonable expectation that DAO will choose to incentivise these pools; however, it is under no obligation to do so.\n\nFull analysis with Graphics and discussion under the link here:\nhttps://gov.bancor.network/t/lm-rewards-extension-eth-wbtc-link-usdt-usdc-dai/1594/8\n\nSummary\n1. At this stage, current protocol growth requires LM to maintain the momentum and stay competitive in the space (the DAO seems aware of this).\n2. After achieving the position of market leader in both TVL and volume, LM extension will no longer be necessary, and the voting for LM extensions may be concluded.\n3. The new shadow tokens pool design will significantly reduce the pressure resulting from insurance on stable assets and should help to create a more sustainable system for long-term stablecoin liquidity.\n4. A large majority of the LM rewards are re-staked to the protocol, increasing the TVL and the space available for TKN deposits with single-sided exposure. If this trend continues, the LM program is more of an asset than a liability, and can be managed more assertively.\n5. In the long term, Bancor is aiming towards sustainable annual inflation of 4%, in order to achieve that, Bancor requires significant volume and Vortex to be applied.\n6. Extension of LM rewards on ETH, WBTC and LINK for 8 weeks will provide 800,000 - 1,600,000 BNTs as rewards, (depends on the multiplier).\n7. Extension of LM rewards on USDT, USDC and DAI for 8 weeks will provide 400,000 - 800,000 BNTs as rewards, (depends on the multiplier).",

You must buy that community's cryptocurrency to mint their oneToken. For example, you must buy wBTC (wrapped Bitcoin) to mint oneBTC (Bitcoin's oneToken). You can use these oneTokens to buy or sell goods and services, pay expenses and taxes, or to create USD exposure in DeFi (decentralized finance) applications.\n\nEvery ICHI is distributed through liquidity mining and every ICHI partner will need to have or start a liquidity mining program. This makes the ICHI community very friendly to AMMs.\n\n**Tokenomics:**\n\nICHI has been community owned and governed from the first block.\n\nA complete timeline of major ICHI community decisions, including links to on-chain transactions, is provided here: https://docs.ichi.farm/introduction/ichi-tokenomics\n\n**Community and Communication:**\n\nICHI does not advertise or promote its system to the general public because ICHI exists to help other cryptocurrency projects. Those other projects speak on behalf of ICHI and drive the adoption of their oneTokens (ICHI stablecoins). Read what a oneWING stablecoin means to wing.finance: https://medium.com/wingfinance/onewing-a-wing-backed-stablecoin-da106dadc4\n\n**Available Audits:**\n\nThere are two completed audits of ICHI:\n\n1. Bramah Systems:[ https://github.com/ichifarm/audit](https://github.com/ichifarm/audit)\n2. defiyield.info:[ https://defiyield.info/assets/pdf/ICHI.pdf](https://defiyield.info/assets/pdf/ICHI.pdf)\n\nRemember, no audit can catch all problems. Please review the [risks](https://docs.ichi.farm/risks/risks) section of ICHI docs to better understand all the risks.\n\n**Market and Trading Data:**\n\n* $48M Market Cap\n* $21M TVL as March 23rd, 2021\n* $8M Liquidity on ICHI token\n* Over 60% of circulating ICHI is locked in DeFi contracts\n\n**Do we really need another stablecoin project?**\n\nAll the other stablecoins are 'takers': stealing locked value for themselves. ICHI is the only one that allows communities to opt into the security and usability of a stablecoin, without stripping away the scarcity of the community's native token. ICHI is a 'maker' for other projects.",

A separate proposal will be submitted for co-investment/LM rewards if the whitelisting passes the snapshot's vote.\n* [88mph](https://88mph.app/) is an Ethereum protocol allowing you to lend your crypto assets at a fixed interest rate. By doing so, you earn upfront $MPH and protocol's revenues paid in $DAI.\n* You can think of 88mph as a deposit account with which you earn a fixed income and the bank rewards you with loyality tokens giving you shareholders rights like cash dividends and goverance power. At the end of the day, you truely own the bank.\n* Fair-launched with a product on mainnet since day 1, no presale, no exotic farming, no BS.\n* [Non-anon team](https://baconlabs.dev/) building dApps since 2017. Learn more about us in this [interview](https://defiprime.com/88mph).\n* Strong community (see Twitter, Discord, TG, Forum. Cf below).\n* Audited by PeckShield, QuantStamp, Certik, and soon by Trail of Bits. We only ship audited code. No sneaky update post-audit.\n* Governance progressively handed over to DAO in early next week 2021 (improvements and protocol's parameters).\n* Involvement with many DeFi protocols and communities under the hood.\n* Our 2021 focus revolves around smart contracts and financial risks management while making sure the TVL can be monetized with a steady growth coming from composaibility with other protocols. Our roadmap will include some products development like structured products on top of our existing zero-coupon bonds and the current improvement discussed [here](https://forum.88mph.app/) for our v3.\n\n## 88mph in 6\n\nThere are 6 different ways to get yields on 88mph:\n1. With the fixed-interest rate bonds (FIRB), allowing someone to get a fixed-interest rate on their assets by depositing them on 88mph to mint a FIRB with a maturity between 7 days and 365 days (user selects the desired maturity). We support 12 differents assets for the FIRB (stables, wrapped ETH, BTC, LINK, UNI).\n2. By using the FIRB, users get MPH rewards vested continuously to them over a 14, 30, or 270d according to the FIRB selected.\n3. By buying the floating-rate bonds (the system's debt created by the FIRB users) and receiving the interests generated by the underlying FIRBs. Effectively leverage longing the floating-interest rates of Compound, Aave, etc.\n4. MPH staking pool to get DAI rewards (100% of the protocol's revenues are distributed to our stakers, no inflationary rewards, true cash dividends).\n5.

The current DEX aggregated liquidity for the MPH:ETH pair is $8.5m.\n\n## Why should you care?\n* 88mph's community suggested to kickstart this process. As a founder, I never realized that Bancor was the most capital efficient way of providing a good trading venue for our users. The thing that surprise me is that if we move 100% of our DEX liquidity on Bancor, we'll be among the top 20 pools.\n* As we grew by 150% in terms of liquidity since January 2021, over time, we expect to see continued growth in liquidity and volume to the platform, which ultimately becomes a benefit for Bancor itself.\n\n* Our social community grew organically from 300 members to 14.5k since the launch. We'll leverage our network to drive as much attention as possible on the new pool and invite our LPs to re-stake their BNT rewards to the protocol.\n\n* 88mph recently launched its [zero-coupon bonds](https://88mph.app/zero-coupon-bonds) (ZCB) on SushiSwap with a liquidity mining incentives. If Bancor's improved onboarding mechanism is released in the following months, the launch of new ZCB represents another medium of collaboration between our respective DeFi communities in the short-terms.\n\n* Offering $MPH tokenholders with a single sided IL free alternative for capital deployment will probably rally the 88mph's community and create a long-term liquidity position with Bancor. Obviously, the end goal is to become part of its ecosystem in a meaningful way by creating the right synergies. \n\nSo, we are looking forward to establish strong links amd friendship between our respective communities (apparently, our community already [signalled interest](https://t.me/join_88mphapp) in providing liquidity on Bancor).\n\nDisclaimer: I'm the cofounder of 88mph and I own some $MPH.\n\n\n## Learn more\nWebsite: https://88mph.app/\nDocs: https://88mph.app/docs/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/88mphapp\nTelegram: https://t.me/join_88mphapp\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/jNBGTjTZ7y\nWeChat: https://imgur.com/uJkDeyC\nYoutube: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEr3cuwaggjkw8TajaPSpgg\nGitHub: https://github.com/88mphapp\nForum: https://forum.88mph.app/\nRadio: https://88mph.app/fm/",

      "content": "**DUE TO THE DELAY IN IMPLEMENTING SNAPSHOT, THE DEADLINE ON THIS PROPOSAL HAS BEEN EXTENDED BY ONE MONTH; THE OVERALL AMBITION, AND TARGETS HAVE REMAIN UNCHANGED**\n\n[Full proposal is on gov.bancor.network](https://gov.bancor.network/t/a-wager-from-the-ocean-lps/1028)\n\n# TL;DR\n\n1. The OCEAN community acknowledges that the pool has fallen short of the Bancor community expectations, and wishes to rectify the situation.\n2. We propose a new kind of incentivised solution to liquidity mining rewards, and one which is potentially generalizable to other token communities.\n3. Herein, we wish to set a defined performance metric for the pool in terms of market volume share, whereupon the LM program for OCEAN is reactivated for a period of 4 weeks.\n4. Thus, the OCEAN liquidity providers become further incentivized to actively promote the Bancor DEX as the default home for OCEAN trading in DeFi.\n5. If the goal is not met, the BancorDAO has no obligation to renew the LM rewards.\n\n# Voting Instructions\n\nTo allow LM activation on the OCEAN pool following a boost in its productivity, vote **FOR**.\n\nTo deny LM activation on the OCEAN pool regardless of its performance, vote **AGAINST**.\n\n# The Case Against OCEAN\n\nThe Bancor Network has obtained an overwhelming majority of the OCEAN liquidity in DeFi. ![|602x292](upload://4NAocV25uIRJDQeInPydT0L7CkK.png)\n##### Figure 1 | Per DEX share of OCEAN liquidity over time. Since inception, the Bancor OCEAN pool has been the most competitive in all of DeFi. Blue = Uniswap, Red = Sushiswap, Green = Bancor.\n\nTo the OCEAN community, the reasons for this are self-evident; freedom from impermanent loss and a generous contribution in BNT from the BancorDAO during a long (already extended once) liquidity mining program have made the platform a haven for OCEAN stakers. Bancor now has 82.7% of the total OCEAN liquidity. The pool is so deep, that DEX aggregators such as 1inch often route 100% of OCEAN trades through the Bancor pool, upto single-transaction values of $100,000.\n\n![|602x284](upload://yfW8aKck3XNspTbL0q9c2Pvu7Vs.png)\n\n###### Figure 2 | Bancor OCEAN performance. At the time of writing, 1inch routes trades below $75,000 exclusively through the Bancor pool.\n\nFrom the perspective of the BancorDAO, their gambit to capture the lion’s share of OCEAN liquidity provision has been a success. However, there is a systemic problem within the OCEAN economy. Token traders appear either unaware, or unwilling to use the resource Bancor has created for its primary intended function - trading. All market forces considered, the Bancor OCEAN pool should be capturing a minimum of 80% of the total OCEAN traffic; however, it has only captured about half of that.\n\n![|602x279](upload://4SRqO7BgeDWpvH7N0ICJKavCa0r.png)\n\n###### Figure 3 | DEX Share of USD Volume for OCEAN. Despite having the deepest pool, lowest slippage and best rates, the OCEAN token traders community is largely ignoring the Bancor pool. Blue = Uniswap, Red = Sushiswap, Green = Bancor.\n\nThe source of the discrepancy is demonstrably the OCEAN community itself. On-chain analysis reveals, as expected, that DEX aggregators direct the expected amount of OCEAN trades directly to Bancor.\n\n![|602x300](upload://yY2R07zsCQC26u5NCz9tP9w2P6J.png)\n\n###### Figure 4 | 1inch Exported Volume Share by DEX. Aggregators, which find the most cost-efficient trade routes, direct the overwhelming majority of OCEAN trade traffic to Bancor. Blue = Uniswap, Red = Sushiswap, Green = Bancor.\n\nThe volume on Uniswap paints an interesting picture. Because their pool is relatively poor, they receive only a minority of aggregator traffic, equal to approximately 4% of the total volume. Approximately half (51%) of the volume is from market makers (e.g. arbitrage), and the remainder (45%) is from regular OCEAN holders.\n\n![|602x279](upload://bkOwy8MlMygC8jejFaXoRjlpnsI.png)\n\n###### Figure 5 | Uniswap OCEAN Trading Volume by Source. Uniswap has a healthy balance of organic trader activity. Blue = aggregators, Red = market makers, Green = organic traders.\n\nThe situation at Bancor is dramatically different. Aggregators and market makers comprise 96% of all traffic; the OCEAN community accounts for only 4% of the volume on the Bancor pool.\n\n![|602x279](upload://oobGrgxLzmlLcEMhysVgsENtpHp.jpeg)\n\n###### Figure 6 | Bancor OCEAN Trading Volume by Source. Bancor has almost zero organic trader activity, and its entire volume share is essentially dominated by market makers and aggregators. Blue = aggregators, Red = market makers, Green = organic traders.\n\nIn summary, despite creating the best, most competitive pool for OCEAN traders in DeFi, the offering has not attracted any interest whatsoever from revenue-earning demographics. Despite significant LM investment from BancorDAO, OCEAN trading share performance has lagged behind other pools;; similar efforts spent on other pools, such as LINK, have borne fruit with a clear trend towards increased community adoption. This is due largely to the superb ability of LINK marines to communicate the utility of Bancor’s offering within their community, and build a stable LINK trading demographic to support their pool.\n\n![|602x377](upload://oalM4x6NtMYp3rBli5UYYU2sC3R.png)\n\n###### Figure 7 | DEX Share of USD Volume for LINK. As the LINK pool gains competitiveness, a clear trend towards increased traction with organic LINK traders is plainly apparent. Blue = Uniswap, Red = Sushiswap, Green = Bancor.\n\n# The OCEAN Community Reply\n\nThe OCEAN community recognizes that the arguments presented above make it fairly difficult to justify continued support of the pool, including and especially with liquidity mining incentives. However, having the scope of the issue presented to us, our resolve to contribute back to the Bancor platform and its community is only further galvanized. Therefore, we take it on ourselves to help bring awareness to our brothers and sisters in DeFi, and help bring the trading demographics that the OCEAN pool clearly deserves.\n\n# A Wager, Of Sorts\n\nThis proposal seeks to establish a basis on which the OCEAN pool may again qualify for extension of its liquidity mining program, as follows:\n\n1. We concede that the current LM rewards program will not be renewed.\n2. Our community will rally together to bring awareness to the OCEAN pool on Bancor, to drive the organic trade revenue over the coming month.\n3. Our target was developed with the assistance of the Bancor team:\n\n  1. The OCEAN pool must achieve a reasonable level of traction with its target demographic.\n  2. Traction is measured as a function of the liquidity and volume share on the OCEAN pool, as follows:\n\n![|248x42](upload://raTYjWrUnQujDsuRzehuHtZTHea.png)\n\n3. The quotient of the total DEX volume share and the total DEX liquidity share for OCEAN on Bancor bust be at least 70%.\n4. This goal must have been sustained for a minimum of 24 hours, and remain true on midnight (GMT+0) 3rd May, 2021.\n5. For example, if Bancor owns 82.7% of the OCEAN liquidity at that time, our wager is to increase its volume share to at least 57.9% (57.9/82.7=70%). As demonstrated above, this is achievable entirely through educating our fellow OCEAN token holders as to the advantages of buying OCEAN directly on Bancor, as opposed to other DEXes, or centralized exchanges.\n\n4. If we achieve this goal, the liquidity mining program is extended on the OCEAN pool for a further 4 weeks.\n5. If the target is not met, we concede the LM program.",

      "content": "# TL;DR\n\n* VIDT has no native staking function to the token, meaning holders of the VIDT token have no way to accrue more VIDT by holding the VIDT token, other than using things such as Bancor or other LP/Lending services.\n* Uniswap currently has $86,000 in liquidity for VIDT (~$176,000 total counting ETH). ~$27,000 volume per 24 hrs generating $83 in fees in the last 24 hours. This is a 17% yearly ROI, even with little liquidity. From my personal experience, VIDT holders in community channels are fearful of supplying liquidity on Uniswap due to impermanent loss.\n* There is currently no VIDT/BNT pool on Bancor, meaning if this proposal were the pass the VIDT/BNT pool would first have to be created, then achieve sufficient liquidity to become a protected V2.1 pool.\n\n# Token contract address\n\n*Contract address*: 0xfeF4185594457050cC9c23980d301908FE057Bb1\n\n*Project Website*: about.v-id. org/\n\n# Discussion\n\nV-ID is a blockchain powered document certification service. The VIDT API enables organizations to certify and secure their digital data against fraud and manipulation.\n\nWith V-ID’s Datalink architecture, V-ID is compatible with virtually any existing system to ensure data integrity without impacting workflows\n\nThe combination of the VIDT API, VIDT Private Cloud and VIDT Smart Contract will seamlessly anchor data from any publisher platform and cloud service to multiple blockchains These blockchains currently include DigiByte, Ethereum, LTO Network, Bitcoin, FTM and IBM Hyperledger.\n\nOrganizations like Airbus, AmSpec and IBM use VIDT Datalink to certify and secure digital documents like certificates, invoices, diplomas and sensor-data. [1]\n\nV-ID has long standing customers, with many having used their services for over a year, who have spent tens of thousands of dollars, or even hundreds of thousands to millions of dollars. Their largest customer has spent over 10,000,000 VIDT. All of this information is able to be confirmed using the Ethereum blockchain, and via a community made website. [2]\n\n# Tokenomics\n\nVIDT Datalink (VIDT) is what makes validations possible. V-ID appoints wallets to issuing organizations containing a balance of VIDT.\n\nEvery time an organization validates a file a VIDT transaction is made which records all necessary details (filetype, validation location, timestamp, identity). The VIDT token used in the transaction will be deducted from the validating organization's wallet. Validations are priced in a USD value which is converted to an amount of VIDT tokens, based on VIDT token price at a certain time.\n\nThe flow of VIDT tokens is as follows:\n\n1. A business using VIDT services purchases a load of VIDT from the “Main Wallet” (0x57E6B79FC6b5A02Cb7bA9f1Bb24e4379Bdb9CAc5 *)* from VIDT with a fiat currency, for validations.\n\n2. The business uses VIDT to validate files, recorded on one of the blockchains VIDT supports. This VIDT is sent to the “Validation wallet” (0xe7C54558a04F2f673Ce271B6C908839e9342a50a).\n\n3. 20% of VIDT spent on validations is burned, being sent to the “Owner Wallet” (0x8636a1100a06cad72c16c663f5ff6a893ddd1584) and then to Ethereums burn address (0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000).\n\n4. 80% of VIDT spent on validations is returned to the “Main Wallet” to be sold again to businesses purchasing VIDT for validations.\n\n5. V-ID buys back 10% of VIDT used for validation services by businesses from the open market. These “buy-back tokens” are burned, making up half of the 20% of burned VIDT tokens in step 3. These tokens are bought back, at random, from various exchanges such as Binance, KuCoin, IDEX, etc. This “Buy-back” address is not officially cited to my knowledge, but it appears to be 0x139f8878889DD20e7CcF9e0afC3DA449B8c445fB\n\n[3]\n\n# Community and Communication\n\nVIDT communication is primarily through Pim Voets (Founder and Lead Concept Design) official Medium, and they maintain an official Twitter, YouTube, Instagram and LinkedIn.

Even with 3% fees, Bancor may still be the best place to trade it if we (the project) concentrate high liquidity there as follows: \n\nThe pool's liquidity (and volume fees for APR) may greatly increase once CoTrader begin its own upcoming COT LM rewards program, on Bancor (instead of e.g. Uniswap). BNT would benefit just as much from CoTrader incentivizing with COT, since its pools are 1/2 BNT. CoTrader may gain large LD as it's a far more developed project than many quick launches that get $3-6M+ liquidity on various DEXs recently.\n\nIf there were LM rewards for COTBNT, miners could earn both LM rewards AND the already great APR fee earnings.\n\n# COT/BNT pool, Etherscan link:\nhttps://etherscan.io/token/0x19db077a54dea3fd4cbcd9d31d4db297562cbd9\n\n# COT token, Etherscan link:\nhttps://etherscan.io/token/0x5c872500c00565505f3624ab435c222e558e9ff\n\n# CoTrader Summary\n\nCoTrader.com was the first live DeFi investment funds on Ethereum mainnet since 2018. \n\nCoTrader fund managers can manage investor assets without holding them. Investors can withdraw from \"smart funds\" anytime, with proof of past ROI and performance fees automatically as trades happen via DEX, pools, and other defi dapps. \n\nCoTrader was one the first 2 companies to ever receive a Bancor grant, to build bancor.cotrader.com\n\n# Tokenomics\n\nCOT utility isn't tied to some promise to use the token in businesses offchain. Rather, its tied to onchain buy-back mechanisms integrated into its smart contracts - its smart funds platform. The COT token is tied to fund performance. Fund managers can set eg 20% as a performance fee. COT token buy-back is then done with 75% of 20% of that 20%, or 3%. 50% of the buy back is burned by sending to 0x0, 25% goes to a 51% voted platform admin, and 25% goes to a bond staking reserve. There are 20B tokens max, with over 18.886B already in circulation.\n\n# Holders\n\nCoTrader has over 50,000 holders, although, admittedly, most of them are from a (very successful) bounty program telegram bot that had over 70,000 people join and follow channels, like, retweet etc.  Most of these were real people, and we tried to prevent bots with various measures.\n\nCoTrader's more significant holders work in blockchain VCs and are seasoned fund managers. Others are not very active traders in crypto, and are holding for the very long run. This latter group liked the idea of someone doing their crypto investing for them. Newers holders are more active traders and DeFi users. \n\n# Total Locked Value (TLV) & AUM potential\n\nTLV is a DeFi KPI, and in our case, amounts to Assets Under Management (AUM). A few large AUM funds are considering using CoTrader, as we approach a market-fitting product. At our current market cap and Total Locked Value (TLV), picking up some of these would be very significant news, and may greatly affect our platform and token prospects.\n\n# Code\n\n8 version iterations of CoTrader's smart contracts are open source on GitHub, where you'll also find Bancor portal work from its grant.\n\nOver $30,000 TLV already sits inside its smart funds as navigable onsite.\n\nhttps://github.com/CoTraderCore\n\n# Audit status\n\nDue to the frequency of updates, the contract has not yet been formally audited. However, the token is a standard erc20 with a fixed supply. The team is committing to an open bounty program, the code is open source, and available on the Cotrader Github page. There have not been any hacks or exploits on the platform. \n\n# Insurance tiers\n\nAs a small market cap coin, this proposal concedes certain modifications are necessary to circumvent possible exploits, inflation, and other unwanted behaviour. We propose that the impermanent loss insurance schedule remain unmodified (i.e. 30% coverage after 30 days, and 100% after 100 days); however, the maximum co-investment from the protocol should not exceed 10,000 BNT (a 99% drop compared to large market cap assets and stablecoins). The small minting limit bottlenecks the single-sided liquidity opportunity for COT holders, thereby encouraging dedicated LPs to purchase and deposit their own BNT in the protocol to support the pool. Moreover, the high APR should also attract additional BNT from outside the COT community, from those BNT holders in pursuit of the highest possible yields. Therefore the 10,000 BNT minting cap presents a low inflation risk, without sacrificing too much opportunity.\n\n# Product View\n\n![image|444x500](upload://AhYoMS3lJ5y5wWkmCYWs25bYVsX.png) \n\n# Bancor/CoTrader business model alignment\n\nCoTrader's biz model is aligned with Bancor: We are planning to add a flagship fund for Bancor LM for the existing whitelisted tokens, and possibly for new projects' LM rewards projects.\n\nAs Bancor's unique BNT token model benefits equally (in 50/50 balance) by others projects' liquidity via e.g. their own LM programs, this Bancor voting DAO can be a natural symbiotic partner and important hub that may vet projects via Whitelisting\n\nWe believe this may kickstart a trend for projects to do their LM rewards launches on Bancor, where there are more benefits.\n\n# Social\n\nSocial channels have many 10,000s of followers, but again, mostly from the old bounty programs.\n\nTwitter has over 35k+ followers\ntwitter.com/cotrader_com\n\nFB has over 38k+ followers\nfacebook.com/ cotrader\n\nTelegram has over 8k\nhttps://t.me/cotrader\nNews channel over 4k\nhttps://t.me/cotraders\n\n\n# Market info\n\nCMC: https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/cotrader\nMessari: https://messari.io/asset/cotrader\nCG: https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/cotrader\n1inch: https://1inch.exchange/#/ETH/COT\n\n# CMC key info\n\n**COT ROI at 229%** \n(Nov 25 2020, 8:32pm PST)\n\n![image|285x500](upload://sfyD8F67m8YaKiY1tuQ14YkGjAj.png)\n\n# Product Videos:\n\nGary Bernstein (Founder) explains at major blockchain event in LA, Crypto Invest Summit 2018\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HU9tdC8sdO8\n\n# Harvard Campus Speaker\n\"The Current State of Cryptocurrency Hedge Funds Part 2\":\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iS1lgXbfWE&t=32m15s\n\n# Custom product video:\n(2018.

      "content": "# STASIS EURO (EURS) info\n\n# Token contract address:\n\n(https://etherscan.io/token/0xdb25f211ab05b1c97d595516f45794528a807ad8)\n\n# Project Website:\n\n STASIS - https://stasis.net/eurs;\n\n# Discussion\n\nEURS is the largest euro-backed digital asset, combining the benefits of the world’s second most-traded currency with the transparency, immutability, and efficiency of the distributed ledger technology. Created by stablecoin crypto-enabler platform STASIS, EURS mirrors the euro’s value on the blockchain and is supported by assurance mechanisms provided via an ecosystem of liquidity providers, custodians, exchanges, payment platforms, and others. Each token is backed 1:1 by euros held in the company’s reserve accounts.\n\nSTASIS is a trusted legit platform focused on transparency with a solid track record and vast expertise in technological, financial, and legal fields (1). Since all EURS are backed with fiat euro, there is no risk for investors and everyday users, who can always exchange their digital assets thanks to the Sellback Service (2).\n\nEURS stablecoin combines experience, trust, technology, and financial infrastructure to enable business growth, narrowing the gap between the European financial and the digital asset markets. This in-house solution utilizes multi-blockchain interoperability to shortcut financial inefficiencies, often present in old-school financial systems. The project has popular global social media accounts and multiple local communities in different countries (over 60.000 members total) and a diverse investor base that includes institutions.\n\nSince USD-backed stable coins are heavily dominating the market, Europeans/Asians are often forced into undesired dollar exposure with little on-chain hedging options. EURS stablecoin seeks to challenge the U.S. Dollar’s dominance in global financial markets. By 2021 it has become a popular tool for daily transactions, free of risks and volatility inherent in conventional cryptocurrencies. The potential of stablecoins use cases has been recognized in times of crisis, and the demand for EURS is growing steadily in the DeFi field (3).\n\n# Tokenomics\n\nEURS is the largest euro-backed digital asset in 2021. As an EIP20/ERC token, it’s the first stablecoin to introduce delegated payments on the Ethereum network. Users no longer have to pay GAS fees in order to make transactions. Instead, they can pay transaction fees in EURS or any other digital asset supported by the STASIS wallet (4) — a huge improvement in terms of user experience.\n\nSTASIS business model for EURS is simple: the project custodians pay a small yield from the reserves and STASIS ecosystem participants to share revenue from customers company refers to them. Custodians take risks that are allowed by their category 2 investment firm license as by MiFID 2. Generally, it's overcollateralized lending against liquid collateral accepted for REPO operations by ECB - meaning sovereign bonds.\n\n# Community and Communication\n\nSTASIS is active on Telegram, Twitter, Facebook and has established accounts in most popular crypto social media. The project team also operates and regularly updates a YouTube account (5). STASIS and EURS are often mentioned in global press media (6). Gregory Klumov, the founder and CEO of the STASIS EURS project, is the project’s main spokesperson (7), often sharing his view on crypto. The STASIS website includes a mailing address in lsle of Man, and a contact e-mail (8). There is also a phone number provided.\n\n# Available Audits\n\nSTASIS provides three verification streams: daily statements, weekly verification from and quarterly audits by BDO Malta. All the information is available publicly (9).\n\n# Market and Trading Data\n\n* EURS price at the time of writing is $1.20.\n* All-time high: $1.38 (May 15, 2019).\n* All-time low: $0.9808 Mar 13, 2020).\n* Price 90 days ago: $1.24.\n* 31,979,207 tokens in circulation.\n* No data on maximum supply.\n* The current market capitalization is $37,863,404.46.\n* The EURS token is available on HitBTC, Tokens net, Changelly, Bitfinex, OkCoin and other exchanges (10).\n* The 24-hour spot volumes range from $1.16 to $1.20.",

      "content": "# Proposal to Whitelist veCRV-DAO yVault (YVECRV-DAO)\n\nContract Address:\n0xc5bddf9843308380375a611c18b50fb9341f502a\n\n# TL;DR\n\nBancor affords Yearn Ecosystem participants and DeFi users, a unique opportunity to earn secondary yield on YVECRV-DAO via single-sided exposure. Further, participants will be protected against impermanent loss (IL).\n\n# Discussion:\n\nYearn Finance is a suite of products in Decentralized Finance (DeFi) that provides lending aggregation, yield generation, and insurance on the Ethereum blockchain. The protocol is maintained by various independent developers and is governed by YFI holders.\n\n# Yearn Finance Vaults\n\nCapital pools that automatically generate yield based on opportunities present in the market. Vaults benefit users by socializing gas costs, automating the yield generation and rebalancing process, and automatically shifting capital as opportunities arise. End users also do not need to have a proficient knowledge of the underlying protocols involved or DeFi, thus the Vaults represent a passive-investing strategy.\n\n# CRV DAO Token\n\nThe main purposes of the Curve DAO token are to incentivize liquidity providers on the Curve Finance platform as well as getting as many users involved as possible in the governance of the protocol. Currently CRV has three main uses: voting, staking and boosting. Those three things will require you to vote lock your CRV and acquire veCRV. CRV can now be staked (locked) to receive trading fees from the Curve protocol. A community-lead proposal introduced a 50% admin fee on all trading fees. Those fees are collected and used to buy 3CRV, the LP token for the TriPool, which are then distributed to veCRV holders.\n\n# veCRV-DAO yVault\n\nThe veCRV-DAO yVault is a vault that accepts CRV in exchange for perpetual claim on Curve DAO admin fees across all Yearn products. The vault may be interacted with on https://yearn.finance/vaults or https://crv.ape.tax/. At the time of writing, participants can exchange CRV for yveCRV and earn 1.42X the yield than if they were to solo stake CRV on Curve Finance platform. This returns about 71.39% APY. However, participants can stack their yield by providing liquidity to the WETH/yveCRV-DAO on SushiSwap. Finally, they can stake their Sushi WETH/yveCRV-DAO LP tokens on Pickle Finance. While this may be lucrative, users could experience IL potentially costing hundreds, if not thousands.\n\n# Bancor Single-Sided Exposure and Impermanent Loss Protection\n\nMost first generation AMMs require LPs to contribute equal or determinate parts of each asset represented in the pool. This is both an inconvenience and a liability for many LPs who may hold only one of the assets and/or are only interested in exposure to that single asset. Bancor v2.1 breaks this paradigm, allowing LPs to contribute and maintain 100% exposure in a single token. LPs can provide liquidity to a pool with single-sided exposure, either in an ERC20 token (“TKN”) or in BNT.\n\nBancor’s IL Insurance accrues over time, by 1% each day, until 100% protection is achieved after 100 days in the pool. There is a 30-day cliff, which means that if a liquidity provider decides to withdraw their position before 30 days passes, they’d incur the same IL loss experienced in a normal, unprotected AMM. If an LP withdraws any time after 100 days, they receive 100% compensation for any loss that occurred in the first 100 days, or anytime thereafter.\n\nBancor will afford an opportunity to DeFi users to participate in familiar, high-yield DeFi protocols in Curve Finance and Yearn Finance, while maintaining 100% exposure in a single yield-bearing token while maintaining protection from IL.",

      "title": "Proposal to whitelist API3",
      "content": "# Clarification: Whitelist, Not Liquidity Mining\n\nThe previous whitelisting attempt was inhibited by the LM rewards governance issues at the time, which have since been resolved. This proposal is **not seeking to activate liquidity mining** on API3. Rather, we are seeking to add API3 to the Bancor whitelist for the purpose of offering impermanent loss protection to API3 liquidity providers.  \n\n# API3\n\nContract address: 0x0b38210ea11411557c13457D4dA7dC6ea731B88a\n\nProject Website: https://api3.org/\n\n# Discussion\nAPI3 is a DAO-governed project that seeks to support the creation, management, and monetization of decentralized application programming interfaces (dAPIs). The API3 community will operate oracle nodes free from third party interference. The project and its community are committed to the future vision of Web 3.0.\nAPI3 is an on-chain oracle service.\n\n# Tokenomics\nThe API3 token sale occurred over 30Nov – 4 Dec 2020, raising $23,000,000 in ETH ([API3 (API3) - All information about API3 ICO (Token Sale) - ICO Drops](https://icodrops.com/api3/)). The distribution was handled via Mesa DEX, and there are approximately 20,000,000 unlocked API3 tokens in circulation. 15,000,00 API3 (15% of the total supply) are vested linearly from the end of the public distribution, 40,000,000 (40%) are vested linearly from the end of the public distribution, in addition to a 6 month lockup period. A further 25% is held for future distribution by the API3 DAO.\nDecentralized governance requires well-balanced incentive mechanisms that accurately model both positive and negative outcomes; the governing entities should be rewarded for good results and penalized for bad ones. The API3 token is designed to facilitate this through three main utilities:\n\n> 1. Staking (dAPI revenue and inflationary rewards). The staking utility provides a financial incentive for community participation, and contribution to the API3 ecosystem. The API3 DAO will set a target staked amount, and the inflationary rewards paid out to stakers will float to meet this target\n> 2. Collateral (backs insurance services that protect users). The collateral utility creates and operational risk for active participants on the platform, thus creating a selfish incentive to preserve the quality of the product, system functionality, public profile, and industry engagement.\n> 3. Governance (Voter/stakeholder representation in the API3 DAO). The governance features give API3 community member agency in the growth and direction of the project. All governing entities provide funds as collateral, again, creating a selfish incentive to govern the system to the best of their ability.\nThese three prongs of the API3 tokenomics model are one and the same – there is a single staking contract that fulfills all three of these features. Staking API3 tokens in this pool affords its user governance privileges, but also exposes them, to the risk of covering insurance claims as needed. The API3 DAO revenue is burned.

However, we realize the pool is also new, and we accept without reluctance that expecting equal footing with established communities is naive. However, from the interest of building and maintaining healthy liquidity, and to help attarct more attention to the pool, we are asking the BancorDAO to consider our whitelist launch with a mid-range BNT coinvestment limit of 500,000 BNT (approx. $2.5m).\nWe look forward to further discussions with the Bancor cmmunity. We have an active API3/Bancor discussion group on Telegram, and we are also frequent visitors to the Bancor Discord server.

      "content": "**Proposal to Whitelist Fetch.ai with a co-investment limit of 250,000 BNT**\n\nContract address: 0xaea46A60368A7bD060eec7DF8CBa43b7EF41Ad85\n\nProject Website: Fetch.ai\n\nProject Documentation: https://fetch.ai/technology/\n\nProposed co-investment limit: 250,000 BNT\n\n# Discussion\n\nFetch.ai is building technology to power the machine-to-machine economy. This includes a novel blockchain and a generic framework for building off-chain protocols using techniques from multi-agent systems. This agent framework can be used for oracles, interchain transfers, state channels and many other applications and is tightly integrated with the Fetch ledger.\n\nThe principal goal of the Fetch.ai ecosystem is to deliver a fully autonomous, agent-based digital economy. The Fetch.ai technology stack is built using principles derived from a branch of artificial intelligence known as multi-agent systems. This approach involves solving different problems from the bottom-up by creating individual autonomous software agents that perform actions in the world to accomplish their individual objectives. By combining the actions of multiple agents, it is possible to achieve outcomes that would not be possible with centralized architectures because the environments are too complex, are spatially distributed or involve multiple stakeholders. Blockchain technology involves the design of incentives to successfully coordinate the actions of multiple disinterested parties to achieve a common goal, and can already be seen as the world’s most successful implementation of multi-agent systems. Fetch.ai is working to generalize and extend the results from this established research field into new domains in finance, supply chain, mobility, smart cities and IoT applications.\n\n# Tokenomics\n\nToken Name: Fet\n\nToken Type: ERC-20\n\nSeed Sale Date: 2017 to June 2018\n\nSeed Sale Allocation: 5.24% of Total Supply\n\nPrivate Sale Date: 3rd April -10th July 2018\n\nPrivate Sale Allocation 6.38% of Total Supply\n\nFET Token Distrubtuion:\n\n![image|690x241](upload://7Bhf0DqZmDfJ1YeFrkup41pA6t8.png)\n\nToken Release Schedule:\n\n![image|690x303](upload://qjNWxtiZVjOxcrML8HhkB3R9521.png)\n\nFetch.AI tokens can be used for many purposes, the largest six of which are:\n\n## Ability to connect agents and nodes to the network\n\nFET is an access deposit token that acts as a form of stake to demonstrate desire to behave appropriately. It modulates the ability for bad actors to flood the network with undesirable nodes or agents due to the escalating cost of doing so. Fetch.AI are performing modelling and simulations on their testnets (both public and private) during the first half of 2019 to determine what this stake should be.\n\nFET has plenty of current use cases, not something that is just getting started.\n\nSee here https://fetch.ai/use-cases/\n\n## Value exchange between agents\n\nThe Fetch.AI token is required in order to allow for two agents, regardless of where they are, to perform a value exchange. The Fetch.AI token is infinitely divisible, thereby supporting transactions that have very low monetary value, but in aggregate provide new and profound level of insight and opportunity.\n\n## Access to search and discovery, and advertisement services\n\nFetch.AI tokens are needed to access, view and interact with the Fetch.AI search engine. This is a space optimized for autonomous digital entities, providing dynamic and autonomous price setting and negotiation.\n\n## Access to Fetch's multi-dimensional digital world\n\nFetch.AI tokens allow agents to view and explore its digital space geographically, semantically or economically. Some of these detailed views involve considerable computing time and communications between many nodes. These more resource intensive operations will require more tokens. Fetch's AI and ML constantly restructure this world to optimize each agent's individual view.\n\n## Ability to access and develop ledger-based AI/ML algorithms\n\nThe Fetch.AI token enables development of and access to a broad range of machine learning and artificial intelligence tasks that are available on the ledger. These may be Fetch-developed primary services such as trust and prediction models, or they may be large-scale independently developed services for network users.\n\n## For exchange into Fetch's operational fuel\n\nOperation costs in Fetch.AI are decoupled from the Fetch.AI token in a similar way to that of \"gas\" on the Ethereum network, but with additional functionality designed to increase the stability of such a fuel and look at addressing issues associated with high and low-velocity economies. Fetch's operational fuel allows access to processor time for contract execution and services for agents.\n\n# Community and Communication\n\nFETCH's Community and communication has been steadily growing.\n\nTheir telegram has 10264 members at the writing of this post.\n\nTheir Github is fairly active, with constant on going development at around 31156 contributions.\n\n[Telegram (English)](https://t.me/fetch_ai)\n\n[Telegram (Chinese)](https://t.me/fetchai_cn)\n\n[Twitter (English)](https://twitter.com/fetch_ai)\n\n[Medium](https://medium.com/fetch-ai)\n\n[Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/FetchAI_Community/)\n\n# Available Audits\n\nCertik Audit linked here.\n\nShowing good and healthy metrics.\n\nhttps://certik.org/projects/fetch.ai\n\n# Market and Trading Data\n\nFetch's price at the time of writing is $.42. It’s all-time high was $.43 8 hours ago. (3rd March 2021), and its all-time low was $0.008 (13th March, 2020). There are 746,113,681 FET tokens in circulation, of a 1,152,997,575 maximum supply. The current market capitalization is $$313,213,586. The FET token is available on major exchanges, including Binance, Bitfinex.\n\nCurrent 24 hour volume is at around 55 million USD.",

The single greatest private holder of ZCN has approx. 1% of the total ZCN supply.\n\n* There are no obvious exploits that could affect the Bancor Network, vis-a-vis developer rug pulls, or whale price manipulation games.\n\n* There is an existing, active liquidity provider community lying in wait, ready to move liquidity to Bancor at the first opportunity. The proposed co-investment limit allows ample space for Bancor to absorb the lion’s share of the total DEX liquidity, while maintaining a substantive incentive for ZCN LPs to buy and stake BNT to increase the pool depth thereafter.\n\n\n\n# Tokenomics\n\nStorage Consumers, aka Clients, can lock tokens and obtain cloud storage in return. Storage Providers, aka Blobbers, can stake ZCN and earn yield on their stake plus a service fee on data written / read by the Clients. ZCN holders can also delegate their ZCN to Blobbers, and earn a yield on their stake plus a percentage of the Blobber’s revenue. Such delegation enables further scalability of the 0Chain storage network by allowing Blobbers who can provide the adequate storage hardware but do not have the required ZCN tokens to join the storage network.\n\nUltimately, the ZCN token value is directly correlated to the amount of data stored on, and read from, the Blobber’s storage network; and thus in turn to the amount of tokens staked by Blobbers (and delegators) for availing such storage capacity. [4]\n\n0Chain decouples this storage network from consensus, which is handled by a different set of service providers. The active consensus set is made up of 100 Miners and 25 Sharders, and is shuffled every 7 days. Miners are responsible for producing blocks and Sharders are responsible for storing blocks. This active set behaves as a control layer for the storage network, facilitating handshakes between Clients and Blobbers amongst other things.\n\n0Chain decouples consensus and storage at the infrastructure layer and couples them at the economics layer albeit via different reward mechanisms; however are all ultimately token centric. This allows for a fast, scalable and lean network that is not resource intensive nor one that constrains or favors any one aspect or group over another.\n\n# Github | 17 Pub. Repos , 200+ Branches\n\n0Chain is a project which has been in development for the last three (3) years. This development went through a two-pronged process of research, third party review, and eventually code implementation.\n\nCutting edge research was done in collaboration with researchers from San Jose State University, University of Maryland, Indian Institute of Technology Madras, and Imperial College of London. Whitepapers are available 0Chain’s website [1].\n\nCode implementation over 3 years and ongoing, 17 active public repositories, 200+ branches, and more than 3000+ commits, is available on Github [9]. The code is production ready and available for download.\n\n![|602x352](upload://f7H7H59Hj9r7JMV7975NjJJIlkg.jpeg)\n\n# Enterprise Awareness & Collaboration\n\n0Chain collaborates with different entities in the Info Tech field.\n\nOn the infrastructure side, data centers are collaborating and offering one-click buy configurations for 0Chain miner and blobber rigs in the US and EU [10]. This collaboration is currently being expanded to other regions as well. These click and buy is expected to accelerate adoption beyond crypto enthusiasts.\n\nOn the tech stack, companies such as Oracle and others have been working with 0chain to address new data compliance regulations. GDPR and CCPA regulations have created a necessity for big tech to innovate the way they handle and store data whilst mitigating liability of such custody.\n\n0chain has been featured on Oracle Blog several times [6].\n\n![|577x432](upload://v4GBhcvDCcLtedJlhMf2vKuGZ6d.png)\n\n![|602x475](upload://64Y0kD2Im398X4cov0LYoxUZmzv.jpeg)\n\n# Storage Network Capacity\n\nMore than 140 blobbers have thus far committed close to 3PB of storage capacity towards 0Chain mainnet at an average of 20TB per blobber. At this rate, network capacity is estimated to exceed 10PB within a year. As more data centers and companies provide one-click server hosting (colo) solutions this rate should increase.\n\nMost blobbers are collocated in Tier 3 data centers worldwide, and thus most if not all, have 1gbps connections. This provided for an enterprise grade decentralized storage network with low latency and high availability.\n\nDevelopers can build applications to make use of this capacity. 0Chain has itself developed 0Box, a Dropbox-like dApp that makes use of this decentralized storage network. Other developers have developed video streaming dApps. Others are integrating into data marketplaces such as Kylin and Ocean. The possibilities are endless and 0Chain is just getting started.\n\nInterestingly, this network capacity lives on the edge of the internet, in data centers within cities. This makes cheap IoT storage a reality. IoT providers can now unload data with low latency to a decentralized storage network within source proximity and simultaneously sell this data on decentralized marketplaces such as Ocean via 0Chain’s Proxy Re-encryption technology without forfeiting data ownership. Cross network marketplaces are inevitable, and IoT data streams sold on such marketplaces is now becoming possible. The road ahead is exciting.\n\n![|602x272](upload://itYnvnQxmqAS4XBtr5Y5llYnAO6.png)\n\n# Community and Communication\n\nThe 0Chain community is a large proponent of DeFI, so much that the community independently crowdsourced its liquidity through a smart contract: a “Geyser” [5] that functions in a very similar manner to Bancor’s Liquidity Mining reward protocol.\n\n![|602x443](upload://51AUyReTAewVADmGIXwdJ3ZQqN9.png)\n\nThe Geyser issues a reward multiplier that increases over time as the liquidity position remains staked. Today, the Geyser currently holds over $700,000 in dual sided liquidity from community members. Since the liquidity on 0Chain’s Geyser is dual sided, it exposes the 0Chain community to IL and is a risk they happily take. However, a whitelisted ZCN on the Bancor Network would see the Geyser liquidity replicated on its Bancor pool, since it enables IL protections that Uniswap cannot, removing the risk and thus increasing staking incentives.\n\n0Chain has an active Telegram, Twitter, Newsletter and Facebook. There are two official chats: the main chat (general and tech related questions), and a “Service Provider” chat (questions related to Mining / Sharding / Blobbing).\n\nThere are several articles on Medium regarding updates, partnerships, and tech. You can also find us on Youtube, Facebook and Reddit.\n\nThe founders, Saswata Basu and Tom Austin, have 15+ years experience operating in Silicon Valley. Saswata has founded several successful startups, with previous experience at Nortel, Harris, and Intel. Tom currently teaches Computer Science at SJSU, with previous experience at Cloudflare and Mozilla [7]. The core team has more than 20 developers.\n\n# Market Data\n\nMax total supply: 400,000,000 (50% is mineable - block & interest rewards)\n\nFDV: USD $244,372,607 [8]\n\nCirculating supply: 135,178,082* (67.5% of minted tokens) [8]\n\n24h trading volume: circa USD 1M+ [9]\n\nExchanges: Uniswap, Gate.io, Bitfinex, Bilaxy, Bancor\n\nDistribution: 25,000 ERC20 addresses.\n\n![|602x419](upload://zMxRXcfpkEodZ3VcgySPVwKUmuJ.jpeg)\n\n# Token Distribution\n\nMax Cap is 400 Million. 50% mineable and 50% pre-mint.

      "title": "BIP12 ADDENDUM: Reorganization of DAO Operations on Snapshot ",
      "content": "# TL;DR\n\n* [Full proposal on gov.bancor.network](https://gov.bancor.network/t/bip12-addendum-reorganization-of-dao-operations-on-snapshot/1467)\n* A new anti-spam measure is being proposed, and will help to maintain organization of DAO operations on Snapshot.\n* The proposed change affects vBNT lockup periods on the governance contracts on Ethereum.\n* At present, vBNT is locked in the governance contract for 7 hours following a new staking event.\n* Herein, we propose to increase the locking period to 7 days.\n* Snapshot block nomination guidelines are proposed:\n  * Invalidate proposals that reference past blocks, relative to the proposal publication.\n  * Invalidate proposals that reference blocks fewer than 2 days into the future, relative to the proposal publication (emergency situations exempted).\n  * Invalidate proposals that reference blocks farther than 2 days past the conclusion of the voting period.\n\n# Voting Instructions\n\nVote FOR to increase the vBNT lockup following a new stake in the governance contracts to 7 days, and instate the proposed snapshot block nomination guidelines.\n\nVote AGAINST to leave the vBNT lockup period at 7 hours, and reject the proposed block nomination guidelines.\n\n# Summary of DAO Transition to Snapshot\n\n* The Bancor DAO has voted in support of [transitioning to Snapshot](https://gov.bancor.network/t/updated-gasless-voting-via-snapshot/1017), to support gas-free governance participation.\n* The new system on Snapshot effectively replaces the DAO decision functions of the [Vote tab](https://app.bancor.network/eth/vote/) on the Bancor app; the overall flow of Bancor governance remains unchanged.\n* The vote tab on the Bancor app will remain, and will serve two main functions:\n  * Staking/unstaking vBNT in the governance contract\n  * On-chain voting to renew/remove Snapshot authority\n* The [governance forum](https://gov.bancor.network/) remains an open discussion board where anyone can create draft improvement proposals, and engage other community members in matters related to the management of the protocol.\n* Submitting proposals to Snapshot for a DAO decision requires 25,000 vBNT staked in the governance contract on Ethereum at the time time of the submission, identical to the current format. Proposals submitted from addresses with insufficient vBNT will not appear on the Snapshot page.\n* Proposals on Snapshot will adhere to more stringent formatting rules, including and especially the nomination of a discrete block for the blockchain snapshot to occur in. Three day voting periods will also be enforced, and moderated by DAO members. Templates will be created for community use, with a view to making the process as frictionless as possible.\n* As a spam prevention, we propose increasing the current vBNT lockup period from 7 hours, to 7 days.\n\n# How Snapshot Works\n\nSnapshot will look and feel the same as our current governance. Addresses with 25,000 vBNT staked in the governance contract will have an opportunity to submit proposals to Snapshot for a DAO decision. If a user attempts to submit a proposal with fewer vBNT staked, the proposal will not appear and no one will be able to vote on it.\n\nEach proposal must nominate a specific block for the Snapshot to be taken. This block must be in the future, relative to the publication of the proposal on the [governance forum](https://gov.bancor.network/), therefore giving community members sufficient time to discuss the proposal, and stake vBNT in preparation for the vote. Guidelines for how far into the future the nominated block should be are detailed in [BIP3](https://gov.bancor.network/t/bip3-governance-changes-bip-documentation-requirements-and-new-majority-and-quorum-rules/97); 2-3 days is a good rule of thumb.\n\nBe reminded that the time requirements are mandatory. If a proposal is created, and submitted to Snapshot for a vote with less than 2 days for community engagement during the drafting phase, the proposal may be invalidated, as per [BIP3 guidelines](https://gov.bancor.network/t/bip3-governance-changes-bip-documentation-requirements-and-new-majority-and-quorum-rules/97):\n\n\"***BIP documentation must be available with sufficient time for consideration by a reasonable and intelligent person. Time sufficiency is commensurate with the complexity of proposal. Minor adjustments to the protocol parameters, required for maintaining the health of the system, are prioritized over time for community deliberation. Similarly, urgent matters requiring immediate action can expedite the sufficient time requirement. Any other proposal that is not of imminent importance to the continuity of the project is not exempted. Low-to-moderate levels of complexity must allow 2-3 days for community engagement before voting commences; moderate-to-high levels of complexity must allow 3-5 days for community engagement before voting commences.***\"\n\nIn the time between publication and the nominated future block, BancorDAO members can participate in discussions, stake vBNT in the governance contract, and participate in signature-only voting once the proposal is live on Snapshot. The voting power associated with each signature is determined at the nominated snapshot block. It is important to realize that the snapshot block is not necessarily timed to the end of the voting period. With the acceptance of this proposal, the following rules for block nomination will become law:\n\n* The nominated snapshot block cannot be fewer than 2 days into the future, relative to the proposal publication (with the exception of emergency situations).\n* Therefore, all proposals nominating a past block relative to its publication are automatically disqualified.\n* The nominated snapshot block must not exceed the conclusion of the voting period by more than 2 days.\n\n![|475x340](upload://e9Tx9zrK4naErMaqJzipApPqidk.png)\n\n# DAO ‘Membership’ and Moderation\n\nIn the common vernacular, the ability to submit proposals to Snapshot and have it visible, and available for community participation is reserved for DAO ‘members’. However, this is only a semantic change; the requirement for 25,000 vBNT to be locked in the governance contract to activate an on-chain vote on Ethereum was already working quite well. The requirement that a proposal must be supported by a DAO member with ‘significant skin in the game’ will continue essentially unchanged. The Snapshot page will be moderated, and invalid proposals removed. This practice remains auditable as all proposals are available for examination on the Bancor governance forum. \n\n# The Bancor Governance Forum is Unchanged\n\nSnapshot is for voting only. Drafting proposals and related discussions continue on the Bancor governance forum as normal, and there is no vBNT, or BNT holding requirement to participate there.\n\n# A Proposed Anti-Spam Measure\n\nAt present, new vBNT stakes in the governance contracts on Ethereum are locked for a period of 7 hours. With the move to Snapshot, we propose to increase this lock-up period to 7 days. This adds a barrier to an annoyance vector where an antagonist may stake vBNT for the purpose of submitting needless/irrelevant proposals, before unstaking and leaving. Increasing the lockup period from 7 hours to 7 days essentially makes spamming the DAO more inconvenient.",

      "content": "Proposal to Delist CHERRY\n\n# TL;DR\n\n* The Roll community money platform was compromised by an external antagonist, [as the team claims](https://tryroll.com/security-incident/) on March 14.\n* The CHERRY token and its whitelisted pool on Bancor need to be removed.\n* Herein, we propose to remove the whitelist status of the CHERRY pool, and remove the pool from the registry with immediate effect.\n* BNT and CHERRY liquidity providers will have an opportunity to remove their tokens from the pool before the whitelisting status is removed, prior to the conclusion of the vote.\n* Any tokens remaining in the pool after delisting will no longer qualify for IL protection.\n\n# Voting Instructions\n\nVote FOR to remove CHERRY from the Bancor whitelist, effective immediately after the conclusion of the vote.\n\nVote AGAINST to maintain the CHERRY pool whitelist status as-is.\n\n# Discussion\n\nThe hack on the Roll platform is extremely opaque. It has come to light that the Roll team keeps a reserve of all tokens minted on its platform. In and of itself, this is not an overt concern. However, it is now apparent that these token reserves were kept in a hot wallet. The Roll team asserts that a hacker was able to retrieve the private keys for its hot wallet, and then proceeded to sell all the tokens contained within. \n\nAmong the affected tokens was the CHERRY social currency. The legitimacy of the CHERRY project and its community is beyond question; however, the token is no longer appropriate for protected status, and its liquidity pool should be removed from the registry.\n\n# What Happens Next?\n\nThis proposal is asking for the protected status of the CHERRY token to be revoked. At the conclusion of the voting period, and if approved by the DAO, the whitelist status will be rescinded immediately. This means that any liquidity providers on the CHERRY pool will have until the conclusion of the voting period to withdraw their funds, at whatever level of insurance they have currently vested. Any deposits withdrawn after delisting will not be eligible for IL protection.\n\nThe CHERRY community is rebooting their project, with the launch of a new token, using a snapshot of token holder addresses prior to the alleged hack. Therefore, the CHERRY pool on Bancor will soon be catering entirely to speculation on a legacy asset. The pool could be allowed to persist without IL protection, although there are no obvious advantages to doing so. This proposal recommends removing the CHERRY pool from the Bancor registry.\n\n# Future Responses to Compromised Tokens\n\nIn the weeks leading up to the incident with Roll, Bancor community members began work on a draft proposal to introduce new security features to the Bancor ecosystem that could protect against these kinds of events. This proposal is being expedited as a result of the events at Roll, and will be presented on the Bancor governance forum for a discussion in the coming days.",

      "content": "Proposal to Whitelist Unibright (UBT) with a 200K BNT Co-Investment Limit\n\nContract address: 0x8400d94a5cb0fa0d041a3788e395285d61c9ee5e\n\nProject Websites: [https://Unibright.io](https://chain.link/) [https://Provide.services](https://provide.services) [https://Baseledger.net](https://baseledger.net)\n\n# TL;DR\n> Activate single-sided exposure and IL protection for UBT\n> 200,000 BNT co-investment limit \n> [Full proposal on gov.bancor.network](https://gov.bancor.network/t/proposal-to-whitelist-unibright-ubt-with-a-1m-bnt-co-investment-limit/1397)\n\n# Tokenomics\n\nUnibright’s native token, UBT (ERC20), tokenomics can be split into two parts: UBT is required to participate in the Baseledger network, and UBT is required to access both Unibright’s and Provide’s services.\n\nUnibright launched as in “input” utility token – UBT can be used to pay for various services provided on the platform, for example discounted blockchain consultancy workshops. Additionally, tokens can be locked for usage within the Unibright framework to cover transaction costs. In 2020, Provide also adopted the UBT token as a payment token, and introduced[ “Provide Payments”](https://providepayments.com/)[40]. Provide Payments introduced “[Universal Blockchain Token](https://provide.services/ubt-token-model)”[41] into the crypto vernacular, reflecting a way for UBT to be used as the base currency for all transaction costs an enterprise blockchain solution may incur. For example, Ethereum and Chainlink may be required to run their solution. The client purchases an amount of UBT each month with Fiat through Provide, which is then used to cover their costs in various other tokens. Hence the client only needs to hold/use UBT, and everything else happens behind the scenes.\n\nWith the release of Baseledger, the tokenomics loop is now complete, as UBT acts as both an “Input” and “Output” token. Previously the token model required holders to either use their UBT or hold it. Baseledger now allows all token holders to participate in the Baseledger Network – either as node operators or proxy stakers. Clients that use Baseledger will pay a flat fee per transaction in fiat, which is then converted into UBT on the open markets, and distributed to node operators and proxy stakers through a proof of stake consensus mechanism, as a reward for securing the network. This staking mechanism does not involve the creation of new tokens or inflation.\n\nIt is worth noting that the Unibright team does not hold any tokens, nor do they rely on the selling of tokens to remain in operation. Of the 150M tokens created, the team initially held 9m. These tokens have now all been distributed and it can be considered that the token supply is now completely distributed. At present, there are approximately 20,000 UBT wallets listed on Etherscan; the biggest individual wallet holds 1.13% of the supply for example.\n\nUBT is a utility token, and the team works closely with lawyers and regulators to ensure compliance with everything currently being done, or planned for the future. Their ICO was among the first in Germany, which is highly regulated by BaFin, and Unibright also completed a [REG D](https://sec.report/Document/0001741355-18-000001/)[42] form for the SEC regarding the ICO. UBT has been listed on both [IDEX for US users](https://medium.com/unibrightio/unibright-and-idex-ubt-added-to-us-audience-85c26997052f)[43] and Coinbase Custody, which gives a strong indication that UBT is compliant with all relevant Regulations.\n\n# Community and Communication\n\nUnibright communication and its community are present on Telegram, Twitter, Reddit and Medium - all links can be found on [Coingecko](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/unibright)[44]. Team members of both Provide and Unibright regularly feature on “The Baseline” Youtube show, as well as TSC meetings. The team also speaks at events and takes part in interviews and AMA’s for the community. Good examples of this would be the recent [AMA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6OqiCwd2Vs) [45] held with Patrick Lowry, CEO of Cryptology AG, and Rachel Wolfson of Cointelegraph, and then also the two part interview with [Hashoshi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IItj47F6cZ4)[46] and [Cryptofiend](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYqsFn5CVkE)[47].\n\nEngagement by the community on twitter is often highlighted as a strength, and all social platforms have seen considerable growth over the last 12-18 months. Community members also have a very active “unofficial” telegram, a community information website, Unitrooper.com, and also a blog that keeps a record of all the most important things said by the team on telegram.\n\n# Available Audits\n\nThe Unibright token is listed on various exchanges, such as IDEX US, Bittrex Global and Coinbase Custody, all of which have high standards and checking of smart contracts that involve the token. It would therefore be reasonable to assume that these exchanges checked before supporting the UBT token.\n\n# Market and Trading Data\n\nUnibright’s price at the time of writing is $1.19. It’s all-time high was $1.64 (19th Feb 2021), and its all-time low was $0.0079 (25th November, 2019). There are 150,000,000 tokens in circulation, of 150,000,000 maximum supply. The current market capitalization is $178,500,000. The UBT token is available on several major exchanges and a number of leading DEXs. In order of liquidity, the top exchanges that have listed UBT are: Uniswap, Bittrex, Quickswap, IDEX US, Kyberswap, and Hotbit. The 24-hour spot volumes range from $922,391 (Uniswap) to $203,462 (Bittrex) and $90,816 (Quickswap).\n\n",

      "content": "## Proposal to Whitelist arNXM and Armor tokens\n\n> [Full proposal at gov.bancor.network](https://gov.bancor.network/t/updated-proposal-to-whitelist-arnxm-and-armor-tokens/1520)\n\n### Voting objective:\n\nFor: add arNXM (500k BNT coinvestment) and Armor (250k BNT coinvestment) to the Bancor whitelisted tokens with only ARMOR and not BNT LM rewards\n\nAgainst: do not add arNXM and Armor to the Bancor whitelisted tokens\n\nQuorum needed: 40%\n\n### The Armor ecosystem: DeFi cover, reimagined.\n\nProject Website: `http://armor.fi/`\n\nProject Documentation: `https://armorfi.gitbook.io/armor/`\n\nArmor is a coverage broker for DeFi, that offers “pay as you grow” coverage for smart contract bugs and attacks. All Armor cover is underwritten by Nexus Mutual.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/ArmorFi/status/1369235069160800256?s=20\n\nThe benefit to the DeFi ecosystem and its users is that Armor cover is:\n\n1. permissionless (Nexus requires registration), and\n\n2. flexible with regard to coverage amounts and policy duration (“Pay as you Grow”).\n\nArmor coverage is enabled by the arNXM yield vault.\n\nThe **arCore Smart Cover System** tracks the user's funds and allows cover that is based on the exact holdings, while being billed per second with no cancellation period.\n\nThe upcoming **arShield** product offers LP/Staking cover that is paid directly from the LP/Staking rewards, offering secure staking for liquidity providers without any upfront costs.\n\nBoth arCore and arShields will utilize coverage underwritten by Nexus Mutual, and thereby, the arNXM yield vault.\n\n## arNXM tokens\n\narNXM is the yield bearing token for the arNXM vault.\n\nThe arNXM Vault accepts the Nexus Mutual wNXM/NXM tokens and puts it to work to produce yield. This is done by unwrapping and staking the wNXM (or NXM) tokens in the Nexus Mutual ecosystem.\n\nUpon deposit of wNXM/NXM, users receive arNXM in return. arNXM can be traded freely, just like wNXM, but it also accrues staking rewards. arNXM produces yield in terms of the underlying token. Holders will arNXM will enjoy:\n\n1. Additional yield from staking rewards\n\n2. Price exposure to the underlying assets (wNXM/NXM)\n\n3. Armor’s coverage for coverage providers’ for minimal risk staking\n\n![|624x232](upload://vsU4Yf6QmCE9pVrPcIJayaxCttJ.png)\n\n## Armor Tokens\n\n**Armor** is the governance token. A total of 1 billion ARMOR tokens are being distributed over two years 1: 65% to community members (including liquidity incentives), 35% to early team members with a 2-year vesting period.\n\nThe responsibilities for governance include:\n\n* Voting on updates to smart contract code\n* Voting on changes to constants used in the fee model (such as premium charge for buyers)\n* Voting on the exact time a hack took place\n* In addition, the token holders for the ArmorDAO may also vote to be given a share of the revenue made by the arCore Smart Cover and arShield systems.\n\n## Armor in numbers.\n\nFor detailed stats on `Armor.fi` (coverage, staking, premiums paid etc.), please visit: `https://duneanalytics.com/armor/armorfi`\n\n## Benefits for Bancor:\n\n### Armor Liquidity mining rewards\n\nThe token distribution model for ARMOR includes special provisions for kick-starting liquidity on decentralized exchanges. This has already been implemented on 4 popular AMMs and we want to add Bancor to that list. It is anticipated that if this vote passes, Bancor would become one of the largest, if not the largest LP for all arNXM and Armor liquidity pools.\n\n### Current AMM liquidity and trading fees\n\nOnly a month after launching, the various arNXM pools on Uniswap, SushiSwap, 1Inch and Balancer (pooled with ETH, wBTC & Dai) have already attracted about $30m in liquidity.\n\nUniswap alone has $6.2m liquidity divided over the different Armor and arNXM pools, with a trading volume of over 1m daily. The total trading volume has been around $2-4m daily, generating significant fees for the liquidity providers.\n\nThe price of arNXM is dynamically changing with respect to wNXM (which is already whitelisted on Bancor) based on change in assets under management (because of staking rewards, or during hack payouts, and debt payments). This creates opportunities for arbitrage traders due to an imbalance between arNXM/wNXM prices, which will massively increase volume for both tokens and thereby fees.\n\n### 16 million Armor in rewards\n\nArmor will offer at least 100K Armor per week in liquidity rewards for the arNXM and Armor pools to start, with 0.51% decrease per week, for a total of over 8m per each pool = 16M Armor over 2 years!\n\n**Armor rewards allocation:**\n\n70% to arNXM and Armor LPs and 30% to BNT LPs\n\nThis means 2.4M Armor tokens will be awarded to BNT LPs and 5.6M will be awarded to Armor LPs over the course of 2 years.\n\n### BNT: the DeFi insurance token trading platform\n\nDue to our symbiotic relationship with Nexus Mutual, and the recent success in stimulating growth on the wNXM pool, the addition of arNXM and Armor to the whitelist schedule could position Bancor as the default trading platform for DeFi insurance tokens.\n\nThis could be an important niche, and Bancor is uniquely poised to capture it. It is worth noting that the active Armor community - The Armor Knights - are highly motivated to make this vision a reality; many are already BNT holders, and are active participants in our DAO already.\n\nNote: the above has been proposed before recently (proposal #34, 17-20 Feb) and 100% voted in favor. We were unable to reach quorum due to high gas fees. This time, we trust that the Bancor community will help the proposal across the finish line.\n\n### Contract Addresses:\n\narNXM: 0x1337def18c680af1f9f45cbcab6309562975b1dd\n\nArmor: 0x1337def16f9b486faed0293eb623dc8395dfe46a\n\n### Available Audits\n\nThe Armor smart contracts have been audited by Haechi, and the reports are available for review via the ArmorFi GitHub page: `https://github.com/ArmorFi/Audits`\n\n## Market and Trading Data\n\n### arNXM\n\nMarket cap = Fully Diluted Market Cap: $18,995,151.23\n\nCirculating Supply: 402,354.40\n\n24 Hour Trading Volume: $482,789\n\n## Armor\n\nMarket cap: $32,438,255\n\nFully Diluted Market Cap: $574,803,229\n\nCirculating Supply: 56,433,668\n\n24 Hour Trading Volume: $1,743,243\n\n**Exchange Availability**\n\nCurrent top exchanges for arNXM and Armor are Uniswap (V2), Sushiswap, 1inch Exchange, and Balancer.\n\n## Information, sources and socials:\n\nArmor ecosystem documentation: `https://armorfi.gitbook.io/armor/`\n\nCoingecko arNXM: `https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/armor-nxm`\n\nCoingecko Armor: `https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/armor`\n\nMedium: `https://medium.com/armorfi`\n\nTwitter: `https://twitter.com/armorfi`\n\nTelegram: `https://t.me/ArmorFi`\n\nDiscord: `https://discord.com/invite/8HuTB22`",

BarnBridge delivers a range of products that allow investors of all skill levels to manage their individual portfolios and risk exposure through a secure, decentralized, and permissionless platform. At scale, BarnBridge creates an opportunity to trade in and out of any risk exposed position for any asset in the world. With infinite liquidity, the project can build an unlimited number of products and hedged strategies. The BarnBridge products are structured to mirror their counterparts in traditional finance, providing an intuitive on-ramp for institutional participation in DeFi.\n\n**Smart Yield** allows users to tranche out the yield from the debt pools of other projects, such as Aave, Compound, Cream or Yearn Finance, and normalize the risk curve via the creation of derivative assets. Users are able to buy ‘junior’ or ‘senior’ tokens, representing different tranches. Junior token holders provide liquidity and buy risk from senior bond investors. The risk is variable rate annuities going below the expected level, whereas those who buy senior bonds will have a guaranteed yield/interest rate for the life of the bond. Juniors benefit from the extra rewards generated by tokens locked by seniors in cases where the variable APY of the underlying lending protocol (including the governance token rewards) are higher than the weighted average guaranteed yields of the seniors. Junior tranches are ERC-20 fungible tokens. Senior tranches are ERC-721 (NFTs) non-fungible tokens.\n\n**Smart Alpha** is market price exposure risk mitigation using tranched volatility derivatives. Smart Alpha bonds will not be structured via traditional yield tranches; instead, they operate via various levels of market price exposure, called ‘risk ramps’. The idea is that every tranche of price exposure does not need to be flat across the entire risk curve; the first $100 of price exposure does not need to deserve the same upside and downside volatility. This is similar to having fractional ownership, but with different risk/reward for the fractions.\n\n[Podcast](https://anchor.fm/open-defi/episodes/Episode-1-BarnBridge-eqijam)\n\n# Benefits for Bancor\n\nBarnBridge has a strong community, many of whom are BNT enthusiasts and current liquidity providers. At the time of writing, if 100% of BarnBridge’s liquidity on Uniswap migrated to Bancor, the pool would be in the top 10 most liquid assets on the Bancor Network. Bancor is a highly respected project within BarnBridge circles, and the consensus on our community channels is that we would prefer that Bancor be the de facto DEX for BOND liquidity provision and trading.\n\nIn recent meetings with the Bancor team, the possibility for dual liquidity mining was discussed. When the feature becomes active, the BarnBridge DAO is interested in exploring using its own liquidity incentives on the pool, and assisting the BancorDAO in growing its TVL. This requires a BarnBridge DAO decision, but as fans of the Bancor protocol, is unlikely to encounter much resistance.\n\nBarnBridge will soon be launching its Smart Yield product, which will create jTokens. The jTokens represent an additional opportunity for extension of BarnBridge’s asset network, built upon the BNT base token. Such extensions to the Bancor network may proceed via a formal whitelisting process, or via the Origin Pool design, described in the most recent progress update. In short, the BarnBridge community is committed to creating a long-term liquidity position with Bancor, and becoming part of its ecosystem in a meaningful way. We see our two communities as having a common interest in the future of DeFi, and we are looking forward to using this first pool as a means to establishing a lasting friendship.\n\n![image|690x386, 100%](upload://iQONBQwyaRgbXKguhhxTrbU9WCo.jpeg) \n\n# Token Distribution\nThe total supply of BOND tokens is 10,000,000. Decentralization is a core feature of the protocol, and is reflected in the token allocation. Distributing tokens in a way that facilitates decentralization is critical as it gives agency to the users of the protocol and ensures governance never resides in the hands of a powerful few. Importantly, from the perspective of the BancorDAO, there are no ‘super whales’ that can threaten the insurance mechanism or rug the token’s price. The minting function is also inactivated; schemes such as those affecting PAID, and bugs such as the one that affected YAM are a non-issue for BOND. Therefore, the IL liability remains entirely dependent on market behavior, and the BOND token is an unlikely candidate for the most common variety of deliberate, or accidental rug-pull liquidity exploits.\n![image|690x351, 100%](upload://je9etsQurlMJCcGnPxhrwZ3pwnv.jpeg) \n\nTokens allocated to the Founders, Seed Investors, and Advisors are locked in a smart contract that releases the tokens on a weekly basis over a two year period. Additionally, to further decentralize the token distribution, yield farmers, liquidity providers, and those who stake the BOND token in the DAO also receive tokens on an ongoing basis until the BOND token has been fully distributed as shown in the schedule below.\n![image|690x338](upload://s1aoqxmkZEe0ob8BlCnkvtN6yLL.png) \n# Summary Articles and Links\n\n### [Introducing BarnBridge](https://medium.com/barnbridge/introducing-barnbridge-3f0015fef3bb)\n\n### [BarnBridge SMART Yield Specs Unveiled](https://medium.com/barnbridge/barnbridge-smart-yield-specs-unveiled-fc42ec527701?source=collection_archive---------8-----------------------)\n\n### [BarnBridge 2021 Roadmap: Barn Building Plans ](https://medium.com/barnbridge/barnbridge-2021-roadmap-barn-building-plans-8be17f4ab51e)\n\n### [BarnBridge Standards and Disclosures ](https://medium.com/barnbridge/barnbridge-standards-and-disclosures-c218bb29c0f6)\n\n### [BarnBridge Website](https://barnbridge.com/)\n\n### [Join the BarnBridge Discord Server!](https://discord.com/invite/FfEhsVk)\n\n### [BarnBridge GitHub](https://github.com/BarnBridge/)",

With visionaries\nlike you, we can create a platform full of opportunities across the industry’s value chain.\nCorporates, large and small, not-for-profit groups and insurtech startups can all come\ntogether to provide better products and services. We aim to use blockchain technology\nto help make the purchase and sale of insurance more efficient, enable lower\noperational costs, provide greater transparency into the industry and democratize\naccess to reinsurance investments.\n\nMore specific, blockchain can help to solve four main problems which pile up costs in\ntraditional insurance companies:\n1. Coordination (“managerial”) costs.\n2. Conflict of interest between customers and company.\n3. Information asymmetry between customers and company.\n4. Access to risk pools\n\n**Token**\n\nEtherisc will build an economic space for decentralized insurance\nThe space will have a broad set of participants, customers, service providers, risk\ncarriers, etc., the goal is to incentivize these participants to cooperate and\nbehave well, and in line with the interests of the whole space.\n\nDesigned the protocol tokens to bind participants to the platform\nand to assure the quality of the provided services. We are effectively implementing what\nis known as \"Staking\", focusing on the specifics of the risk transfer.\n\nEven with this staking, Bancor is attractive. \n\n![IMG_3965|231x500](upload://71cVhhzOCywkHYzVLFUmrKWyXSD.jpeg) ![IMG_3966|231x500](upload://2A7eywdcJdlt1DBVyxc7HXUPibr.jpeg) ![IMG_3967|231x500](upload://fyIfaAwusEsFl6qKwqQjNA8DnfC.jpeg) \n\n![IMG_3968|231x500](upload://sYjvFMEd3xVCXI5skpSOYJl1bll.jpeg) ![IMG_3969|231x500](upload://wA3KhlMX6qMzdpqTOz9AbyQ4Rfi.jpeg) \n\nThe team/community is active in Telegram with over 3,000 members: https://t.me/etherisc_community\n\nGeneric Insurance Framework (GIF) Tutorial: https://blog.etherisc.com/gif-tutorial-part-1-dc595057c1b9 \n\nDecentralized Insurance: Quantifying Risk for The Immutable: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ATDVJys8Wjo \n\nInclusive Insurance in Sri Lanka: https://blog.etherisc.com/etherisc-aon-and-oxfam-in-sri-lanka-on-a-mission-to-expand-inclusive-insurance-in-sri-lanka-696b51c98d9b \n\nMentioned in an article by Adelyn Zhou, CMO of Chainlink Labs: https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/how-blockchain-smart-contracts-are-reinventing-the-insurance-industry-2021-01-29\n\nEtherisc was founded in 2016, and in the past four years they've spent a lot of time exploring the regulatory frameworks for blockchain based insurance.\n\n**MarketData**\n\n## Etherisc DIP Token Price and Market Stats\n\n|DIP Price|$0.294873|\n\n|Etherisc DIP Token ROI|-24.6%|\n|Market Cap|$53,402,609|\n|Market Cap Dominance|0.00%|\n|Trading Volume|$1,822,190|\n|Volume / Market Cap|0.0344|\n|24h Low / 24h High|$0.294856 / $0.355095|\n|7d Low / 7d High|$0.251815 / $0.324772|\n|Market Cap Rank|#379|\n|All-Time High|$0.424327 -26.8%\nFeb 05, 2021 (14 days)\n|All-Time Low|$0.00226715 13596.1%\nJul 11, 2020 (7 months)\n\nEtherisc DIP Token Supply|Circulating Supply|175,510,489 DIP|\n|Total Supply|1,000,000,000 DIP|\n|Max Supply|1,000,000,000 DIP|",

      "content": "Proposal to Activate Liquidity Mining for AMP and Increase Co-investment limits to 150k BNT\n\nEvolution between Bancor and AMP, proposal for LM rewards on the AMP/BNT pool. Adding to a comprehensive whitelist discussion:\n\nhttps://gov.bancor.network/t/proposal-whitelist-amp-bnt-pool/539\n\n# TL;DR\n\n* Proposed activation of liquidity mining rewards on AMP.\n* Proposed increase in BNT co-investment to 150K.\n* Target single-asset exposure limit designed to surpass Uniswap liquidity in single stroke.\n* AMP community has the utmost respect for Bancor, and sees the two projects as working together to achieve a lasting, meaningful impact on the world.\n* AMP LPs are staking-natives, not farm-and-dumpers. BNT rewards are likely to be returned en-masse back into the pools.\n\n# Voting Instructions\n\nVote FOR to activate liquidity mining rewards for AMP, and increase the protocol co-investment to 150k BNT,\n\nVote AGAINST to deny liquidity mining incentives, and leave the co-investment limit at 20k BNT.\n\n# M A C R O\n\nThe Flexa Network enables crypto-collateralized payments in a real world-facing context. There is currently 19B AMP (441M USD) of spending capacity on the Flexa network [1].\n\nThis crypto is diligently compliant with regulations,[1] and led by an experienced team.[2]\n\nThe network allows for cryptocurrencies such as BTC, ETH, and others to be used to pay for goods and services, while the vendor receives payment in fiat. This ability to settle transactions in national currencies directly from cryptographic assets is solving many current weaknesses in existing payment systems. The payment network is already accepted at leading merchants including GameStop, Nordstrom Rack, Ulta Beauty, Office Depot, Regal, Lowe’s, and others. Such integration with economies outside of cryptocurrency is a profound step towards mass adoption.\n\nOnline and offline benefits are apparent, and use of the Flexa Network will bolster the utility, value and trust in the crypto ecosystem. Currently AMP can be traded on Gemini (59%), Bittrex (0.3%), and Poloniex (0.1%).[1], [3]\n\nAMP holders are excited to be involved in yield farming opportunities. Encouraging AMP token holders to stake in Bancor has potential to be the most profitable single asset exposure staking opportunity for AMP tokens available on the market (especially users using Gemini). For Bancor, there is an opportunity to attract and capture a community of token holders that are actively engaged in infiltrating real-word markets and use cases for cryptocurrency.\n\nAMP can be swapped on bilaxy (17%), uniswap (11%), sushiswap (7%), Bancor (0.7%) [3] and moonswap (0.08%),[6] who offers a Conflux L2 solution to lower txn costs for LM incentives which are live since January 14, 2021. Users providing liquidity for the cAMP-cETH pool will earn transaction fees and ongoing MOON utility tokens.[5]\n\nIt is a reasonable ambition for Bancor to grow its AMP pool be the dominant source of liquidity on any DEX. Activation of LM rewards creates a positive incentive for AMP HODLers to engage in long term liquidity provision, and become active members of the BNT community.\n\n|Total Value Locked|Amount|\n| --- | --- |\n|USD|467.1M|\n|ETH|254.7K|\n|BTC|8.1K|\n|AMP Locked|19.27B|\n|% Supply Locked|< 0.01%|\n|Blockchain|Ethereum|\n|Most Locked|$AMP|\n\n# M I C R O\n\nFlexa have been working with[ ConsenSys](https://www.consensys.net/) and[ Trail of Bits](https://www.trailofbits.com/) to develop enhancements to Flexa Capacity and Flexa network collateralization.[2]\n\n* Supply of AMP is fixed at 100B AMP\n* Flexa uses its token, “AMP”, to collateralize crypto-payments while they are confirmed on the respective digital asset networks and settles the payment in fiat to the recipient. This solves a few issues that have plagued the crypto ecosystem like slow confirmation times on networks, price volatility, and broad adoption.\n* AMP is the digital asset token used to collateralize payments on the Flexa Network, making them instant and secure. The project is built on Ethereum in accordance with the ERC20 standard for tokens. AMP can be bought and sold for fiat currency or other digital currencies.\n* Amp is a digital collateral token designed to facilitate fast and efficient value transfer, especially for use cases that prioritize security and irreversibility.\n* Amp is an open-source collateral token standard that enables instant and irreversible collateralization of any form of value transfer.\n\n* Security has dramatically improved for Flexa Capacity and its related smart contracts by moving all major collateralization interactions on-chain. The result is a faster, more reliable, and more robust system for staking and moving collateral between apps.\n* Flexa has added support for Coinbase Wallet and the WalletConnect protocol, along with MetaMask, Rainbow, Argent, Trust Wallet, Gnosis Safe and\n\nConflux.\n\n* As collateral, AMP insures the value of any transfer while it remains unconfirmed - a process which can take anywhere from seconds to hours to days. AMP tokens used as collateral are generally released when consensus for a particular transfer is achieved, making them available to collateralize another transfer. In the event that consensus is not achieved for the transfer, the AMP collateral is liquidated to cover losses.\n\n* Flexa is a payments network that enables fast and fraud-proof payments for merchants all over the world. By using AMP partitions as collateral pools, Flexa can secure payment authorizations while the underlying asset remains unconfirmed, and approve merchant transactions in close to real-time.\n* AMP facilitates instant, verifiable assurances for any pending or future value transfer, so that any actions dependent on the transfer can proceed without delay. By using Amp as collateral, individuals and entities benefit from the security and efficiency of collateral which is transparently attestable on an immutable ledger.\n* AMP is also asset-agnostic; it’s feature set is universally compatible with any form of value transfer, digital or physical, and can therefore be used to facilitate instant, irreversible transactions for any kind of asset.\n* To organize the process of staking collateral on-chain, AMP employs the concept of collateral partitions. For each entity, process, application, or transaction being collateralized, Amp designates a partition that can be accessed or managed by any number of operator addresses, enabling fine-grained control and extensibility over a virtually unlimited set of use cases.\n* Amp smart contracts and related source materials were audited by independent security researchers at ConsenSys Diligence and Trail of Bits.\n\n[1] https://amptoken.org/docs/amp-101\n[2] https://medium.com/amptoken/amp-the-new-digital-collateral-token-524bc568af92\n[2] https://app.flexa.network/\n[3] https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/amp#markets\n[4] https://defipulse.com/flexa\n[5] [https://medium.com/amptoken/to-the-moon-8df491b4522f ](https://medium.com/amptoken/to-the-moon-8df491b4522f)\n[6] https://moonswap.fi/analytics/token/cfx:acdkyd8tmezzs6cvmfwtpkg7y9k8cnhdapfcganwt9",

We realized right away that NFTs would be huge, and knew that whoever could build out a fun game with an interesting in-game economy would play a major role in defining the future of gaming. Axie is our answer to that mission.\n\nWe hope that Bancor can see AXS as an opportunity to engage with an enthusiastic and dedicated new community of LPs. The Axie token is an atypical asset, representing the long tail that Bancor expressed a sincere wish to claim in its early documentation. Axie could be the gateway token to capturing the attention of a growing culture surrounding recreational blockchain utility. As our community becomes integrated within Bancor, we can help to facilitate engagement with adjacent projects, and help to drive further adoption of BNT. Our story is a cautionary one, and you will find no greater advocate for the profound value of Bancor’s IL protection than with us.\n\n# Tokenomics\n\nToken Name: AXS\n\nToken Type: ERC-20\n\nSeed Sale Date: November 2020\n\nSeed Sale Allocation: 11%\n\nPrivate Sale Date: Summer 2020\n\nPrivate Sale Allocation 4%\n\nAXS Token Distrubtuion:\n\n\n# Token Release Schedule\n![|624x388](upload://bn2iph27pmmxZO4oON0MNqhKXFP.png)\n\n# What is AXS?\n\nAxie Infinity Shards (AXS) are the glue that binds all Axie community members together.\n\nAXS holders will be able to claim rewards if they stake their tokens, play the game, and participate in key governance votes. Players will also be able to earn $AXS when they play various games within the Axie Infinity Universe and through user generated content initiatives.\n\n## Staking\n\nPlayers will be able to lock up their tokens to receive newly created AXS. Stakers will also be required to vote and play to claim rewards.\n\n## Payment\n\nAXS will be accepted as currency within the Axie NFT marketplace. AXS may also be used to determine eligibility for participation in certain sales/auctions conducted by the Axie team.\n\n## Governance\n\nIn early 2021, the Community Treasury will go live and begin to receive revenues generated by Axie Infinity as well as a portion of staking rewards. This treasury will be governed by AXS stakers once the network has become sufficiently decentralized.\n\n## Staking AXS\n\nAXS staking acts as an incentive for holding AXS and supporting the ecosystem. Stakers receive freshly issued AXS and will be able to signal their support for various proposals to improve Axie Infinity. AXS stakers will eventually direct usage of The Community Treasury.\n\n# Community and Communication\n\n[Discord](http://discord.gg/axie)\n\n[FAQ](http://axieinfinity.com/faq)\n\n[Website](http://axieinfinity.com)\n\n[Twitter](https://twitter.com/AxieInfinity)\n\n# Available Audits\n\n[Quantstamp Audit](https://cdn.axieinfinity.com/landing-page/AXS_Audit_Report.pdf)\n\n# Market and Trading Data\n\nAXS Price March 15: $5.93\n\nAXS Price January 15:$0.53\n\n24h Volume: $100,101,852.81\n\nMarket Cap: $255,881,774.33\n\nFully Diluted Market Cap: $1,605,270,284.97\n\n# Available exchanges: Many (see below)\n\n![|624x263](upload://lTEicxLJ2AmL1SErBbvfOkpSfpu.jpeg)",
