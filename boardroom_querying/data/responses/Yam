Our aim is to ensure the robustness of the Yam Finance ecosystem by adopting these corrective measures.\n\n**Blacklisting the Flawed YIP-210**\n\n* **Purpose:** Prior to implementing the new version, it is paramount to blacklist the previous YIP-210 due to the identified math bug. This will prevent any further potential risks or damages to the Yam ecosystem.\n* **Procedure:** The blacklisting process will involve revoking all permissions associated with the flawed contract and notifying all stakeholders of this action. Additionally, any pending transactions or actions associated with this contract should be halted immediately.\n\n**Whitelisting and Execution of the Revised YIP-210**\n\n* **Purpose:** The new YIP-210 has undergone a thorough revision to correct the previously identified math bug. Whitelisting the revised contract will ensure that the Yam ecosystem benefits from the rebalancing mechanism without any vulnerabilities.\n* **Procedure:**\n  * **Whitelisting:** Upon a satisfactory review, the contract will be whitelisted, allowing it to interact securely within the Yam ecosystem.\n  * **Execution:** The YIP-210 will be executed, establishing the rebalancing strategy for the STETH/USDC ratio in the Yam treasury.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nOur primary objective remains the security and sustainability of the Yam Finance ecosystem. These corrective measures for YIP-210 are in line with this goal. We urge all stakeholders to understand the necessity of these actions and to provide any feedback or concerns they may have.",

      "title": "YIP-210 Whitelist, NFT Project Funding, Developer Payment, Bug Bounty",
      "content": "## Proposal: YIP-210 Whitelist, NFT Project Funding, Developer Payment, Bug Bounty\n\n### Introduction\nThis proposal combines several important initiatives aimed at enhancing the Yam Finance ecosystem. It encompasses the whitelist implementation of YIP-210, funding for a new NFT project called Yiqi, payment for the development of YIP-210, and a bug bounty reward. These measures will strengthen the governance system, support innovative projects, incentivize contributions, and ensure the security of the platform. Please review the details below for each component of the proposal.\n\n### YIP-210 Whitelist\nThis component seeks to whitelist the implementation of YIP-210, a contract designed to rebalance the STETH/USDC ratio on the Yam treasury. The original proposal, which was approved, can be found [here](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/yam-finance/proposal/40). Whitelisting the implementation will enable secure integration within the Yam ecosystem, ensuring the successful execution of the rebalancing mechanism. The code for YIP-210 can be found [here](https://github.com/yiqi-nft/YIP-210).\n\n### NFT Project Funding (Yiqi)\nThis proposal requests funding for the design, creation, and deployment of a new NFT primitive called \"Deposit to Mint.\" Yiqi is an innovative NFT project that allows users to deposit ETH to mint an NFT. The project features a unique treasury system that allows for pro-rata redemption by burning the NFT. It incorporates burn fees to discourage repetitive minting and burning. Additionally, it collects burn fees and royalties from secondary sales, which are deposited into the treasury to increase the pro-rata redemption value of all NFT holders. The NFT collection will be based on individual 1 of 1 Avatars representing the Chinese Zodiac with interchangeable backgrounds that promote well-being for the holder and the avatar. The funding will be used for smart contract development, artwork creation, website development, branding, marketing, and more. This project aims to revitalize the NFT ecosystem and restore confidence in the market. More details about Yiqi can be found [here](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/yam-finance/proposal/41). The code for the Yiqi NFT contracts can be found [here](https://github.com/yiqi-nft/yiqi-contracts). Some of the avatars that will be produced in the NFT project can be viewed [here](https://zodiac.super.site/).\n\n### Developer Payment (YIP-210)\nIn recognition of his outstanding contribution, this proposal includes a payment for 0xChefMike, who developed and deployed the YIP-210 proposal. 0xChefMike's expertise and dedication were crucial in bringing this initiative to life. Providing fair compensation demonstrates our appreciation and encourages further participation from talented developers within the community.\n\n### Bug Bounty Reward\nTo maintain the security and integrity of the Yam governance contracts, it is essential to incentivize community members to actively search for vulnerabilities. This proposal includes a bug bounty reward for Zach, who discovered a vulnerability in the Yam governance contracts. The vulnerability involved the votingDelay() parameter, which allowed for potential manipulation of governance votes. By offering a reward, we acknowledge Zach's efforts and encourage the community to actively participate in identifying and resolving potential security risks.\n\nBy implementing this proposal, we demonstrate our commitment to fostering a secure, innovative, and community-driven environment within the Yam Finance ecosystem. Your support for this comprehensive initiative is greatly appreciated.\n",

      "content": "# Request for Funding: \"Deposit to Mint\" NFT Project\nAuthor: @Feddas Contact: IYamFeddas.eth@skiff.com\nCo-Author: @Stockscotty\n\n## Summary\nThis is a request for funding to design, create and deploy a new NFT Primative \"Deposit to Mint\". Deposit to Mint is an innovative NFT project that allows users to deposit ETH to mint an NFT. The project features a unique treasury system that allows for pro-rata redemption by burning the NFT. There is a burn fee to discouraging repetitive minting and burning. The platform also collects burn fees and royalties from secondary sales, which are deposited into the treasury to increase the pro-rata redemption value of all NFT holders. The goal of this new primative is to align the interests of the team, holders and prospective buyers. **The treasury will be converted to Liquid Staked ETH to earn yield for Yam's Treasury.**\n\nThe theme of the NFTs will be individual 1 of 1 Avatars based on the Chinese Zodiac with interchangable backgrounds that highlight feng shui elements to promote well being for the holder and the avatar. Sample NFT image: \n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HkhiOGuEn.jpg)\n\nNFT supply is projected to be 8888 NFTs, and deposit will be .1 ETH. \nProject can be further expanded upon with additional backgrounds that are interchangable or additional seasons. \n\n## Background\nThe NFT market, once a booming space, has experienced a significant slowdown in sales and trading. The reasons behind this decline can be attributed to several factors, including unfulfilled promises by project teams, mis-aligned incentives, and an oversaturated market. Deposit to Mint offers a sustainable and inclusive solution to the current issues faced by the NFT market. By aligning the interests of all stakeholders and incorporating unique features like pro-rata redemption, burn fees, and yield generation, this project has the potential to revitalize the NFT ecosystem and restore confidence in the market.\n\n@feddas Yam contributor since 2020 who has been and still is responsible for maintaining the treasury and protecting holder's interests around the treasury.

Discord / Twitter / Forums (closed) / Github / Gsuite (closed) / Website is all under his sole control. He has removed admin access from other team members without a vote or consultation. https://snapshot.org/#/yam.eth/proposal/0x617192f236033eac7439ec0b3ef8765c7b5eaf4279609ff02b195fb248ca20a8\n2. Snapshot has also been censored by 0xE. Yam holders are no longer able to submit proposals without 0xE's approval. All proposals will be submitted to Yam's governance from now on. Any questions or discussions can be done via the link on the proposal.\n\n## I. Introduction\n\nWe are seeking proposals from competent and experienced blockchain developers to design, implement, and test a smart contract system that will execute the treasury management rebalancing strategy as described in YIP-210.\nhttps://snapshot.org/#/yam.eth/proposal/0xaee9727ec0319e77da7ac49d5e4db631a75fb034aa27748e688c4bfb8458c349\n\n## II. Project Summary\n\nYIP-210 seeks to simplify treasury management by adopting a rebalancing strategy for a portfolio consisting of 70% ETH and 30% USDC, with a rebalancing threshold of 7.5%. This strategy is intended to lower maintenance and minimize on-chain smart contract interactions with the treasury. Based on backtesting, this strategy has shown to provide superior results compared to a buy and hold strategy since 2021, with lower volatility.\n\n## III. Scope of Work\n\nThe selected contractor will be expected to perform the following tasks:\n\n1. **Develop Smart Contracts:** Design and build smart contracts to automate the rebalancing of the treasury based on the rules defined in YIP-210. The smart contracts should adjust the balances of the treasury to 70% stETH and 30% USDC.\n\n2. **Testing:** Thoroughly test the smart contracts under different scenarios to ensure they function as expected. This should include unit tests, integration tests, and stress tests.\n\n3. **Deployment:** Deploy the smart contracts to the Ethereum mainnet and provide necessary documentation for their use.\n\n4. **Maintenance and Support:** Provide ongoing support and maintenance for the smart contracts, including any necessary updates or bug fixes.\n\n## IV. Proposal Requirements\n\nProposals should include:\n\n1. Detailed technical approach explaining how the objectives will be achieved.\n2. A project timeline with key milestones and estimated completion dates.\n3. Information about the proposing team's qualifications and experience with similar projects.\n4. Examples of previous work on smart contract development, preferably with a focus on treasury management or similar financial applications.\n5. Detailed budget, broken down by task and total costs.\n6. Any risks or challenges the team anticipates and proposed mitigation strategies.\n\n## V. Selection Criteria\n\nProposals will be evaluated based on the following criteria:\n\n1. The technical feasibility of the proposed approach.\n2. The proposing team's experience and qualifications.\n3. The proposed budget and timeline.\n4. The quality of previous work.\n\n## VI. Proposal Submission\n\nPlease submit your proposal by email to iyamfeddas.eth@skiff.com no later than 5/15/2023. Proposals received after this date will not be considered. All submissions should be in PDF format.\n\nIf you have any questions about this RFP, please direct them to iyamfeddas.eth@skiff.com. We look forward to reviewing your proposal.\n\n## VII. Confidentiality\n\nAll information shared in the RFP process will be treated as confidential and will not be used for any purpose outside the scope of this process.\n",

Discord / Twitter / Forums (closed) / Github / Gsuite (closed) / Website is all under his sole control. He has removed admin access from other team members without a vote or consultation. https://snapshot.org/#/yam.eth/proposal/0x617192f236033eac7439ec0b3ef8765c7b5eaf4279609ff02b195fb248ca20a8\n2. A small group of YAM token holders who bought at a discount to treasury value tried to exploit the Treasury by allowing redemptions AND donating (to their own charity) the rest of the treasury from people who did not or forgot to claim. This small group of malicious individuals was actively supported by 0xE. https://snapshot.org/#/yam.eth/proposal/0x3db446c52f54bba28b95551dfa8f55ca0a9fda868dbec04d37a46467eb3fc1bf\n3. All proposals will go thru snapshot and or offical governance proposals from now on. Any questions or discussions can be done via the link on the proposal. 0xE is in fact in control of snapshot as well, so if there is any censoring there, we will move it to the official governance proposals. \n4. YIP-210 is a continuation of the work that was interrupted on YIP-114. Since then there has been a redemption and the treasury has been partially redeemed. This proposal will finalize the work done on YIP-114 by creating a rebalancing structure that is related to the investment risk orginally chosen back when the treasury was managed. \n5. Yam DAO has been put into a hibernation mode, to preserve the treasury and wait till there are more interested non-malicious parties in rebuilding the DAO. Feel free to contact me at IYamFeddas.eth@skiff.com if you are interested in helping. \n\n## Summary\n\nThis YIP-210 simplifies the treasury management to a rebalancing strategy for a portfolio consisting of 70% ETH and 30% USDC, with a rebalancing threshold of 7.5%. This will allow for super low maintaince and minimal on-chain smart contract interactions with the treasury.\nBased on backtesting of this strategy, it has proven to provide superior results compared to a buy and hold strategy since 2021, with lower volatility. Longer term buy and hold basis generally out performs but it ultimately depends on at which point did you buy. \n\n\n## Methodology:\n\nUsing TradingView's strategy tester, we implemented a rebalancing strategy for an ETH/USD portfolio holding an allocation of 70% ETH and 30% USDC. This strategy involves checking the portfolio balance every 30 days and rebalancing if the difference between the current allocation and the target allocation (70% ETH, 30% USDC) exceeds the rebalancing threshold of 7.5%.\nLink to the strategy and code: https://www.tradingview.com/v/hKwtzj9w/\n\n## Results:\n\nThe results obtained from the TradingView strategy tester demonstrate that our rebalancing strategy significantly outperforms a buy and hold strategy since 2021. However, it is worth noting that buy and hold generally performed better when starting from 2021 and earlier. Despite this, the lower risk associated with our rebalancing strategy makes it an attractive option for treasury management.\n\n## Next steps\n1. Complete YIP-114 by adjusting the balances of the treasury 70% ETH and 30% USDC. \n2. Invest all ETH into wstETH to earn yield.\n3. A monthly check if it is necessary to rebalance the treasury. ",

      "title": "[Fixed] YAM Redemption",
      "content": "# Summary\n\nThis proposal overrides any previous or conflicting proposals regarding redemptions and/or donations, and includes all relevant options as discussed in the linked forum thread.\n\n# Context\nThe entity known as 1tx.capital has repeatedly misrepresented the concerns of the Guardian Multisig members on forums and discords, and has previously attempted to send YAM Treasury funds that remained un-redeemed after 1 year to a wallet that was created by 1tx.capital. This by all intents and purposes is viewed by the Guardian Multisig members Hodldwon, Feddas, and Chilly, as an attack on the Treasury and was rightly blocked by the Guardian function. \n\nAdditionally, the snapshot presented here:\nhttps://snapshot.org/#/yam.eth/proposal/0x714af9e0c378f0e8c82267eded4e3f5abae978d2c2a02e4d858754c938ba9a72\nis grossly malformed as an Approval Vote, that attempts to double-count votes by combining options Pro-rata GiveDirectly and Pro-rata Gitcoin Donations. Additionally it did not include an option for Temporary Redemption, nor does it reconcile any complexity involved with accounting for the YAM Redemption or \"pro-rata\" calculations.\n\nI, Hodldwon, therefore submit this corrected snapshot proposal with all relevant options included.\n\n# Proposal\nThe Treasury assets will need to be converted to either ETH, WETH, or USDC depending on the result of this proposal. And Redemption calculations will need to consider YAM in dead addresses like 0x0000...000, dust accounts, and any YAM owned by the DAO, or Operational Multisigs. Another Snapshot should be made to determine how the Treasury should be simplified for the accounting of redemptions, or donations, before any on-chain contract is submitted to hold or distribute YAM Treasury assets, otherwise it should be blocked by the Guardian function.\n\nThis proposal is conducted as an Approval Vote, so select all Options you agree with (more info https://youtu.be/orybDrUj4vA).\n\n## Options as follows:\n1. No redemption.\n2. Redemption forever.\n3. Temporary Redemption. Return un-redeemed funds after 3 months back to YAM Treasury.\n4. For Pro-rata Split. Split un-redeemed funds between GiveDirectly and Gitcoin proportionally to votes on 6 and 7 (only valid if this receives the most votes).\n5. Against Pro-rata Split. Do not split un-redeemed funds between GiveDirectly and Gitcoin.\n6. Redeem+donate to GiveDirectly. Send un-redeemed funds after 1 year to GiveDirectly.\n7. Redeem+donate to Gitcoin. Send un-redeemed funds after 1 year to Gitcoin.\n\n### About Option 1 \"No redemption\"\nYAM DAO continues as before, but redemption of YAM for Treasury assets is no longer considered a valid proposal and all attempts at redemption will be treated as theft by the Guardian Multisig.\n\n### About Option 2 \"Redemption forever\"\nAll Treasury assets are locked in a Redemption contract forever with no chance of withdrawal other than redemption via burning YAM.\n\n### About Option 3 \"Temporary Redemption\"\nCore YAM team members and YAM holders have requested the ability to allow for Redemption, but then continue operations of the DAO afterwards. This option will allow a brief window for YAM to be redeemed for Treasury assets, before those assets are returned back to the Treasury and DAO operations can be continued.\n\n### About Option 4 \"For Pro-rata Split.\"\nIf Option 4 receives the most votes, then the votes on Options 6 and 7 will be used to calculate the allocations towards GiveDirectly and Gitcoin. If GiveDirectly receives 100 vote, and Gitcoin receives 200 votes, then Gitcoin would receive twice the amount as GiveDirectly.\n\n### About Option 5 \"Against Pro-rata Split\"\nIf some YAM holders are against donations, and against pro-rata splitting, they need an option to signal that in a vote, without contributing to either Options 6 or 7.\n\n### About Option 6 Redeem+donate to GiveDirectly https://www.givedirectly.org/\nâGiveDirectly is a nonprofit that lets donors like you send money directly to the worldâs poorest households. We believe people living in poverty deserve the dignity to choose for themselves how best to improve their lives â cash enables that choice.â\n\nThey seem to manage and own their own Eth wallet, which is publicly displayed on their website (https://www.givedirectly.org/crypto/).\nCurrently they accept:\nETH https://etherscan.io/address/0x750EF1D7a0b4Ab1c97B7A623D7917CcEb5ea779C\nUSDC https://etherscan.io/address/0x0aC59E6F995BE28c809a102670F325ad94fE5f6E\n\n### About Option 7 Redeem+donate to Gitcoin https://gitcoin.co/grants/\n\"The Gitcoin Grants Program is a quarterly initiative run by Gitcoin DAO that empowers everyday believers in web3 to drive funding toward what they believe matters, with the impact of individual donations being magnified by the use of the Quadratic Funding (QF) distribution mechanism. QF was introduced in a paper published in 2018 by Vitalik Buterin, Zoe Hitzig, and Glen Weyl.\n\nGitcoinâs mission began in 2017 by creating better incentives to support and fund open-source software developers. The mission eventually solidified to building and sustaining digital public goods. GR1, in 2019, saw 200 contributors and $38k raised. Since then, we have run two-week rounds once per quarter, with the most recent being GR15, which saw a total of $4.4M distributed to grantees. Across the first 15 grant rounds, $50.82M has been distributed in total.\n\nDuring a QF round, the community contributes to the project they feel should be funded and supported; a matching partner offers funds to match the communityâs contributions, but not in a 1:1 match. Instead, the fund matching is more aligned with the sentiment of the community as opposed to the sheer dollar value amount raised by any grantee. The number of contributions matters more than the amount funded.\"\nGiveDirectly has specific Ethereum addresses for specific assets.\n\nGitcoin DAO accepts ERC20s here:\nhttps://etherscan.io/address/0x57a8865cfb1ecef7253c27da6b4bc3daee5be518\n",

      "title": "YAM Redemption",
      "content": "Summary\n\nThis is a further proposal to clarify whether and on what basis a redemption should occur.\n\nCertain individuals have complained about the governance process of the previous snapshots. This snapshot is intended to âfixâ any issues with the previous process undertaken.\n\n7 days ago, I posted on Discord and the YAM forum with the draft proposal and invited any constructive comments on the proposal and/or process (https://forum.yam.finance/t/the-great-yamdemption-2/1785). I did not receive much comments or follow up conversation. \n\nI have received indications that certain members on the multi-sig will veto any on-chain proposal, but I have not received any satisfactory reason for them doing so based on governance processes. Instead, a member of the multi-sig, @HodlDwon has confirmed that the multi-sig is able to cancel on-chain votes âat any time, and for any reason, or no reason at allâ and even suggests that yam.finance is not the officially endorsed website for YAM. It now makes sense why YAM is -99.6% of its ATH and reinforces the need to redeem.\n\n\nThe proposal\n\nThere are four options to vote on:\n\n1. No redemption \n2. Redemption forever \n3. Donate to charity (pro rata GiveDirectly) after 1 year redemption window \n4. Donate to charity (pro rata Gitcoin) after 1 year redemption window \n\nOption 1 and 2 are standalone options and are self-explanatory. Options 3 and 4 are to be counted together and, if they were to win, the ratio of the votes will reflect the pro rata allocation of the donation to the respective charity. \n\nThe option(s) with the highest vote (i.e. Option 1, Option 2 or Options 3+4) will then go to an on-chain vote. If the token holders vote for a redemption (i.e. Options 2 or 3+4), the base of the code has already been developed by me and @E (and it was good enough for @Feddas to then use for his own proposal) so I do not expect there to be any substantial changes in order to get this up and running.\n\n\nAbout GiveDirectly\n\nFrom their blurb:\n\nâGiveDirectly is a nonprofit that lets donors like you send money directly to the worldâs poorest households. We believe people living in poverty deserve the dignity to choose for themselves how best to improve their lives â cash enables that choice.â\n\nGiveDirectly is a reputable charity that Jack Dorsey publicly endorsed and donated to last year (https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2021/03/09/twitter-ceo-will-donate-proceeds-from-the-genesis-tweet-to-givedirectly/). They seem to manage and own their own Eth wallet, which is publicly displayed on their website (https://www.givedirectly.org/crypto/). \n\nPotential Questions:\n\n- If a redemption goes on-chain, what if the multi-sig vetos the proposal? The purpose of this snapshot is to confirm the desire of the majority of token holders and the multi-sig should respect that decision. To veto the majority would confirm that the multi-sig is not acting in the best interests of YAM and that the governance of YAM is actually centralized by a small number of individuals at the expense of the majority. @HodlDwon has already confirmed that he thinks he has ultimate control over YAM. If the other members of the multi-sig agree with HodlDwon and confirm that the governance of YAM is centralized, then they should be aware of their potential personal liability for any damages/losses suffered by token holders (see comment above about YAM being -99.6% of its ATH) in the event it is deemed a security.\n\n- Why is there no option for a temporary redemption? That proposal was decisively voted down by an on-chain vote, with almost 90% of votes being against the proposal (https://www.tally.xyz/gov/eip155:1:0x2DA253835967D6E721C6c077157F9c9742934aeA/proposal/33).\n\n- Is there code for any on-chain proposal on redemption? Yes. This code has already been developed and endorsed by two core contributors of YAM, E and Feddas (Feddas himself confirmed that the code âLooks greatâ and âsubmitted itâ as an on-chain proposal with minor edits to fit his failed parameters). The code underwent a lengthy and public development process on #yam-development and no one objected to the code. Assuming token holders vote for a form of redemption, only minor adjustments will need to be made.",

Both snapshots have failed but it is likely that they will try again. \n\n**Evidence of impropriety:** \n![](https://i.imgur.com/cJnN8up.png)\n2 Snapshots that have failed: \nhttps://snapshot.org/#/yam.eth/proposal/0xe2b29b6ed210b7737c1e397b9a9449035f265475c152986182d29588f1571232\nhttps://snapshot.org/#/yam.eth/proposal/0x3db446c52f54bba28b95551dfa8f55ca0a9fda868dbec04d37a46467eb3fc1bf\n\n## Solution - \n1. **Ban / ignore all further discussion and votes that would send un-redeemed funds without approval from the holders of un-redeemed YAM.**\n2. **Update the Guardian Multisig** - We need to update the guardian multisig to include people who will stop bad actors who want to spend other YAM holder's part of the treasury but not their own. \n\n### Who should be on the Guardian Multisig\nThis proposal will be removing anyone who is currently on the guardian multisig that: \n1. Would no longer like to be a guardian\n2. Would not vote to cancel an on-chain transaction that would allow donation of other peopleâs funds but not their own.\n3. Does not respond within 48 hours. \n\nThis proposal will add anyone that would like to apply.\nAnyone is qualified if they meet either one of these criteria: \n1. Anyone who has publically spoken out agianst the theft of un-redeemed funds before the time stamp of this posting. \n2. Anyone who has voted on the past 10 snapshot proposals with these requirements:\n    a. With above 3k BOU YAM. There are many bots that auto vote every snapshot with minimal number of YAM. \n    b. Did not vote to donate un-redeemed funds to charity on either of the snapshots. \n    c. A member of the community before Oct 9th. \n\n    \n### Additional Info\nThe two wallets that are primarily trying to redeem and donate the un-redeemed treasury have bought all their YAM at a significant discount to treasury value. By going thru with the redeem, they stand to profit immediately but they want to also steal the treasury from the people who are unaware or don't keep track. \nhttps://etherscan.io/tokentxns?a=0xAbC8e9b22e8658Ac6d61d86cA035AFDb8a453da2\nhttps://etherscan.io/tokentxns?a=0x2281A3Cd35AD0314f4aAB831017930078ED461F7\n",

      "title": " YIP-201 The Great Yamdemption Revised by Feddas",
      "content": "**YIP-201 The Great Yamdemption Revised by Feddas**\n\n**Basic Summary**\nThis is an [alternate proposal from the 1tx's proposal to redeem the treasury](https://forum.yam.finance/t/the-great-yamdemption/1758)\n\nThere has been some **impropriety by 1tx, where he's been offering to pay YAM token holders to vote for donating to his charity (Watoto)** with un-redeemed treasury assets. \n![](https://i.imgur.com/cJnN8up.png)\n\nI, Feddas, have and will fight to try to create a self-sustaining long term Yam DAO, see [YIP-200](https://forum.yam.finance/t/yip-200-the-next-phase-of-yam/1747) but **I do understand that people want to redeem their YAM tokens for the Treasury.**\n\nI am proposing the same thing without donating any un-redeemed treasury assets. Any token holders at the end of the redemption period can choose to do what they want to with the treasury assets. \n\n**Motivation - Why am I proposing it?**\n1. Un-redeemed treasury funds are not anyone's to give away, they belong to the YAM token holder. They should do with it what they please. \n2. Anyone choosing to redeem has exited and given up their governance rights, they cannot decide for the others.\n\n\n**Specifications**\n\n1. Vote for all of the options you would like to see happen. The highest voted choice will be the decision. \n2. If we decide to redeem the treasury, We will need to hire a smart contract dev to fork / edit / deploy a similar smart contract [contract used by Lobis](https://etherscan.io/address/0x889dfe07caa0baf3814ddcd1b933d208d9913b5e) to redeem the treasury. Any associated costs will be voted on. Open invitation for anyone to take over this responsibility, but as the proposer, it will default to me. I would like to be ready to deploy within 30 days. \n3. I've included multiple lengths of redemption, please vote for all that is acceptable to you. The longer it is the longer it will take to resume Yam operations. In order to maintain Yam services like hosting / discord / forums allocate $500 per month during redemption to operations multisig. \n4. Before redemption any owed compensation, owed dues and approved silos must be paid out in its entirity to leave no liabilities. **Full disclosure,** this includes the remaining milestones for my silo (unable to complete due to redemption) [Silo-02: Yam Treasury Management and Maintenance Framework Silo](https://forum.yam.finance/t/silo-02-yam-treasury-management-and-maintenance-framework-silo/1693) which is part of YIP-114 and YIP-200. If the community wants me to rework YIP 114 and YIP 200 with the new treasury I will do so. \n",

The YAM DAO owns approximately [41,873 UMA tokens](https://etherscan.io/address/0x8348c5ec31d486e6e4207fc0b17a906a0806550d), worth approximately $116,400 at the time of writing, which can be used to vote and earn rewards. This grant would be paid to the *designated voter* (me) to compensate them for their time spent researching and voting with this YAM.\n\nPlease review the Forum Post [here](https://forum.yam.finance/t/uma-delegated-voting-grant-1/1737) and the specification document [here](https://forum.yam.finance/t/uma-delegated-voting-project-specification/1736)\n\nVoting YES for this proposal approves the Grant and payment based on the terms listed on the forum post.",

      "title": "YIP-115 Updating Compensation Procedures",
      "content": "## Overview\n\nThe new compensation model developed in the Re-Org has 2 main parts. The application part and the payment part. In the application part, a contributor will apply for funding with specific deliverables and milestones that they aim to meet. These could be further broken down into monthly progress updates where a portion of the compensation is paid out after work has been open sourced, documented, and reviewed by token holders.\n\nAt the most basic, a contributor says what they plan to do and then at the end of the month they describe and show what they did in a compensation request post. If the work is finished, great! If not, they can describe what caused the slow-down and how they will move forward given the issues.\n\nOnce the post is up, token holders (or some delegated party) should determine if payment is warranted. As described [here](https://rossgalloway.github.io/docs-website/docs/siloDocs/YAM%20Re-Org/Deliverables/YAM%20Replanted%20Docs/The%20New%20Yam%20DAO%20Model/optimistic-grants), this model is âoptimisticâ so it requires someone to dispute the payment request within a certain time period, otherwise it will be paid by default. If the request is not disputed then it will be added to the next on-chain proposal.\n\nCreating a flexible system that is clear, legible, and fair is key to attracting and retaining contributors. Contributors are responsible for submitting reports on time and should have clear expectations for when that needs to be. The Gov-Ops council (specifically those who write the on-chain code) are responsible for keeping the schedule and including or removing contributors. \n\nFor additional information on this vote, see the discussion thread listed below.\n\n## Specifications\n\nHere, I will propose 2 options for the timing of the flow listed above: condensed and extended. Refer to the \"Payment Flow\" section in the forum post for more information about the general flow.\n\n### Option 1 - Condensed Timeline\n\n- Contributor Compensation Reports are submitted between the 1st of the month and the 5th of the month, documenting work done in the last month(s).\n- (optional) Gov-Ops posts a reminder for contributors to submit on the 4th.\n- Gov-Ops posts the on-chain contract for review on the 6th of the month.\n- Token holders have 3 days (longer if reports are posted before the 5th) to review the reports and dispute those they disagree with. Any disputed report is excluded from the current on-chain transaction and will need to be re-submitted in the following month's review.\n- Gov-Ops has 1 day to make adjustments to the on-chain contract based on disputes and/or adjustments made in the review period.\n- The on-chain transaction is proposed on the 10th and takes 7 days to complete (2 days voting and 5 days time-lock).\n- Upon approval, Gov-Ops executes the contract and transactions.\n\nReviews of the compensation reports and on-chain contract are both done in 3 days. Contributors are paid ~ 2 weeks after submitting their reports.\n\n### Option 2 - Extended Timeline\n\nAlthough the condensed timeline seems to be preferred, I will document an extended timeline below which has some different trade-offs.\n\n- Contributor Compensation Reports are submitted between the 1st of the month and the 7th of the month, documenting work done in the last month(s).\n- (optional) Gov-Ops posts a reminder for contributors to submit on the 6th.\n- Gov-Ops posts the on-chain contract for review on the 8th of the month\n- Token holders have 14 days (8th to the 21st) to review the reports and dispute those they disagree with. During this time, contributors can provide additional information to prevent disputes going to a vote. Any late compensation reports should be disputed by default. \n- Reports that are still disputed after the review period are voted on, starting on the 22nd, until the 28th.\n- After dispute vote are complete Gov-Ops will adjust the on-chain contract to reflect the outcomes.\n- The on chain transaction is proposed on the 1st of the next month and takes 7 days to complete.\n- Upon approval, Gov-Ops executes the contract and transactions.\n\nReview of the compensation reports is done over 14+ days and review of the on-chain contract is done over 28+ days. Contributors are paid a month after submitting their reports.",

      "title": "YIP-112 vote 1 - as needed YAM minting",
      "content": "# YIP 112 - Minting YAM to Pay Contributors and Vesting Implementation\n\n## Summary\n\nThe YAM treasury does not have enough YAM to pay contributors fully for this month. This proposal recommends minting YAM to pay contributors monthly as part of the on-chain transactions. Only the amount of YAM owed to contributors would be minted in these transactions, and a new vesting procedure, using [Sablier](https://sablier.finance/), would be implemented to further align incentives (vote 2).\n\n## Rationale\n\nAs discussed in [this post](https://forum.yam.finance/t/yip-107-vesting-pool-sunset-migration-and-mint/1631) and subsequent snapshot vote, 370,000 new YAM was minted to make up for the YAM trapped in the original Vesting Pool contract. \n\nThe current balance in the treasury is 100,280, which will not cover this upcoming month's payroll obligations of ~130,000 YAM. There are a few options to proceed:\n\n1. Mint as needed to meet payroll on a monthly basis.\n2. mint a large lump sum and try to estimate how much is needed to meet a certain time frame.\n3. Pay entirely from the treasury (either in USDC or another asset, or my trading an existing treasury asset to YAM).\n\nThis proposal puts forward option 1 as the preferred choice. \n\nOption 1 negates the need to guess as how much YAM needs to be minted (an impossible task to get right) and constrains the maximum quantity to be a function of the treasury size. It focuses the discussion not on whether minting YAM is good or bad, but whether the contributions of contributors is worthwhile (option 3 also has this trait). It allows token holders fine grained control over how much YAM is created via the grants approval process. Unlike option 3, it limits treasury burn. I wrote more about why this is preferable [here](https://forum.yam.finance/t/the-dao-must-mint-more-yam/1680#contributor-compensation-3).\n\nVesting will be voted on in a second vote.\n\n## Specification\n\nIf this proposal is passed, the following process would be carried out:\n\n1. Total YAM contributor compensation amounts would be determined monthly by the Gov-Ops Council based on approved grant proposals and grant payment requests, based on the 30 day TWAP for the month in which the work was carried out. \n2. This amount would be minted in the monthly on-chain transaction by calling the `mint()` function on the YAM token contract for the amount determined in step 1.\n3. payment with or without vesting will be determined by a second vote.\n\nIf this proposal is not passed this month then no YAM will be paid this month. The owed amounts will be recorded on github and backpay will be included in the next month's on-chain proposal.\n\n## Out of Scope\n\nThe minting of YAM for any purpose other than contributor compensation is out of scope of this proposal.\n",

      "content": "TLDR\nCreate a Treasury director position that has the mandates: \nIncrease the overall value of the treasury with approved investment strategy and Yam project/silos.\nMinimize overall expenses from the treasury.\nSupport value added Yam projects/silos.\nIncrease overall value of the Yam Token and Market Cap.\nMaintain overall investment risk profile of the treasury.\n\nPaid in 100% YAM vested for 6 months. More details below. \n\nBasic Summary\nYam is completely governed by its token holders. The founders of Yam (who no longer are participating on a regular basis) created Yam as an experiment in decentralized governance of a Treasury. Since YamV3 launched, Yam has produced a few notable projects including Yam Synths and DAO House but unfortunately both projects have been shelved primarily due to the lack of resource management. Currently Yam is going through a Re-Organization to address the issue of having someone responsible for completion of work as specified/requested.\n\nYAM Re-Org Silo Creation and May Grant Application 1. What is your name? Pseudonyms are cool too. disguised_face Who is the point person is for the application? @ross, @designer 2. What is your discord/telegram handle? speaking_head Discord: Ross sweet_potato#2221, designer#6682 3. Project Name building_construction What should we call your project? YAM Re-Org and Upgrade - May 2022 Grant In this application, we intend to create the YAM Re-Org Silo (described below in queâ¦\nProblem\nWhile the Yam Re-Org is a necessary step in accountability and transparency of projects, we donât have a good system/person in place to oversee the treasury. Previously this task was left to the âtoken holdersâ but as we have seen it is more likely token holders will sell the token before they participate in governance.\n\nThe treasury has been and will be the most important piece of Yam, without it nothing else matters.\n\nSolution\nAll items listed in highest priority to lowest priority.\n\nI propose the Yam Treasury Director position with the following mandates:\nIncrease the overall value of the treasury with approved investment strategy and Yam project/silos.\nMinimize overall expenses from the treasury.\nSupport value added Yam projects/silos.\nIncrease overall value of the Yam Token and Market Cap.\nMaintain overall investment risk profile of the treasury.\nThe Treasury Director will be responsible to:\nReview and approve/deny any requests to the treasury from regular expenses to contributor compensations to new silos or projects needing funding.\nMaintain treasury investment risk profile by initiating rebalancing when needed.\nCreate guidelines that follow/supports mandates.\nThe Treasury Director will not be responsible to:\nChange the investment strategy of the treasury. Director can make the request but ultimately it needs to be processed through governance.\nIdentify potential value added projects/silos or investments. Director can make the request but ultimately it needs to be processed through governance.\nSpecifications\nTerm Limit\n3 Months term with unlimited renewals via snapshot.\nNew director can be voted in at any time, which would relieve current director.\n\nEstimated Commitment\nTime Commitment: 20 hours a month expected. Not to exceed 40 hours a month. Hours to be recorded and accounted for in monthly transparency reports.\n\nCompensation: Base rate of $85/h, 100% in 6 month vested $YAM tokens based on the 30 day avg value.",

Implementing the grants model with the current contributors while we continue to work it out has been very helpful in understanding where the pain-points are for the process, and I expect similar benefits from this working implementation.\n\n## Beta Implementation\n\nThe proposed beta implementation would begin with 3 members: @Ross, @Feddas, and @ethe .

      "title": "Treasury Redemption re-Vote",
      "content": "# Treasury Redemption re-Vote\n\nProposal by @ross, @ethe, @feddas, @Designer, @chilly\\\n7/7/2020\n\n---\n\nThere was [a snapshot vote that recently passed](https://snapshot.org/#/yam.eth/proposal/0x48be1e680491b50416595d0a9a9f3e4b233edbf6b9977623fda63b1b5af3d3fc) to allow redemption of the assets in the YAM treasury with YAM tokens, with 54% voting for, 46% voting against, and meeting 410% of quorum (2.05M YAM voting). This vote was put up without any announcement or presentation in the public governance discussion spaces of the DAO (Discord and/or Discourse Forum) and passed on a last minute push.\n\nAs a DAO, we are beholden to the will of the token holders, and so this vote passing is a big event and must be respected. With that said, we are beholden to ***all token holders*** and the fact that this vote was created in what could be considered a sneaky and underhanded way cannot be ignored. A vote of this magnitude should be thoroughly discussed and announced, with ample time for stakeholders to weigh in and vote. There are rules around creating proposals and giving sufficient notice to token holders to make a decision. An unannounced vote does not meet these criteria.\n\nInstead of making a unilateral decision that this vote is invalid, we recommend that it be re-proposed via the proper channels and announce it widely so that all token holders have the ability to weigh in and ample time to understand the issues and vote. If those who proposed the vote believe that a treasury redemption is the will of the YAM token holders then they should have no problem with a well publicized vote.\n\n## The Proposal\n\n>***How much you would receive per YAM: ~ $0.25***\n>\n>Yam is trading at a significant discount to its book value. This proposal would allow token holders who would like to exit to do so and allow long term holders to remain. The primary argument against doing so has been that it would hurt the projects future by draining the treasury to the point where development cannot continue. This is provably false for several reasons with the main being that well over 80% of the YAM supply is in wallets that do not move and can be seen as stagnant as well as not voting or delegating. This means that a very significant percentage of the treasury will remain to sustain years(at the current burn rate) of future development for those who decide to hodl.\n>\n>This is an off chain proposal to gauge if an on chain proposal should be made in order to determine if the majority of active and voting yam holders would like to have the option to redeem their yam from the equivalent ratio of the treasury assets.\n>\n>There are several simple and secure solutions for the implementation of this if chosen by the community. The most obvious and secure solution would be to utilize the exact same smart contract used by Lobis[sic] to dissolve itâs treasury holdings: <https://etherscan.io/address/0x889dfe07caa0baf3814ddcd1b933d208d9913b5e>\n>\n>Please signal you interest in being able to redeem YAM from treasury assets. I do believe it most practical to have this window open for the period of 1 week. After this time window, the assets would be transferred back to the yam treasury and redemptions closed.\n\n---\n\nThis vote will be up for a week after it is posted to the discord and socials, with another week to vote on snapshot. To ensure fairness, the snapshot block for the new vote will be set to the same snapshot block as the original vote. The votes will be announced on the discord, this forum, and via the official YAM Twitter.\n\nOne editorial note: The redemption price listed in the text above is innacurate. You can see the value and composition of the treasury [here](https://dune.com/ethedev/Yam-Dashboard). There is ~$3.16M in the treasury and the  supply of YAM is 14,692,088. That Yields a redemption value of ~$0.224 per token (as of 2022.07.19). This number will be subject to change as the value of the treasury changes, and the number of YAM increases by 12,000 weekly due to liquidity mining incentives.\n",

This vote is to ratify sending the balance of the Treasury UMA to the 2-key Contract. Methodology to send is the same as the last on-chain transaction and is laid out in the specification below.\n\n### Details\n\nAmount: 41,091.589...

      "title": "Allow Yam Redemption for Treasury Assets",
      "content": "*** How much you would receive per YAM: ~ $0.25 ***\n\nYam is trading at a significant discount to its book value. This proposal would allow token holders who would like to exit to do so and allow long term holders to remain. The primary argument against doing so has been that it would hurt the projects future by draining the treasury to the point where  development cannot continue. This is provably false for several reasons with the main being that well over 80% of the YAM supply is in wallets that do not move and can be seen as stagnant as well as not voting or delegating. This means that a very significant percentage of the treasury will remain to sustain years(at the current burn rate) of future development for those who decide to hodl.\n\nThis is an off chain proposal to gauge if an on chain proposal should be made in order to determine if the majority of active and voting yam holders would like to have the option to redeem their yam from the equivalent ratio of the treasury assets.\n\nThere are several simple and secure solutions for the implementation of this if chosen by the community. The most obvious and secure solution would be to utilize the exact same smart contract used by Louis to dissolve itâs treasury holdings: https://etherscan.io/address/0x889dfe07caa0baf3814ddcd1b933d208d9913b5e\n\nPlease signal you interest in being able to redeem YAM from treasury assets. I do believe it most practical to have this window open for the period of 1 week. After this time window, the assets would be transferred back to the yam treasury and redemptions closed.",

E believes for yam to gain further values, on a protocol level it must accomplish several milestones and be up to the level and base standards to lead by example (as uniswap aave compound optimism uma chainlink and others â¦), which from comes the main purpose of the yam dev documents that E has been working on and recently posted for further feedback collection. E believe going through this path will give yam a solid core yet a scalable and attractive model with value add long term.*\n\n### A. Yam Core Development (Planning)\n\nFor June and July, as i have already begun will continue progressing on figuring out the long term core vision of the yam protocol development plan as outlined on the [Yam Core Development](https://forum.yam.finance/t/yam-core-development/1689), [Yam Protocol Multichain](https://forum.yam.finance/t/yam-protocol-multichain/1688) and the linked docs. My main objective prior getting into any dev work is to complete forming the mentioned with further planning, specifications and timeline updates. Which from and once fully scoped, i am going to propose and proceed with to entirely start focusing on.\n\n### B. Yam Infrastructure\n\nFor the next 3 quarters (Q3, Q4 2022, Q1 2023), i will continue maintaining infrastructure, services upkeep and the onchain activity in terms of proposal contracts development, testing, deployments, proposing, execution and following up through, as well for basic assistance, data collection from snapshots and individuals to progress forward. This however does not include things that consists of feature implementation, for example the creation of another contract or a focus that it can relate to, although i will give a feedback to whichever extent of my ability in terms of ideating around a feature request. This includes the usual of being there and help facilitate things.\n\n**For June and July:**\n\n- **Goals:**\n    1. Finalize / update the core development plan.\n    2. Collect feedback from the community.\n    3. Finalize the high level specs / timeline to proceed with the development.\n    4. Maintaining monthly the mentioned specifications under âB. Yam Infrastructureâ.\n- **Comp:** E monthly rate of $9917 in USDC and $4250 in YAM tokens based on the 30day avg value.\n\n**Recurring, after finishing with (A.):**\n\n- **Goals:** Maintaining monthly the mentioned specifications under âB. Yam Infrastructureâ.\n- **Comp:** Monthly rate of $3850 in USDC and $1650 in YAM tokens based on the 30day avg value.\n\n@e: Note i am pushing to finalize the plan as mentioned in A. and sooner, to then start with it around July, taking into account any changes needed which for i would revisit this section with an update accordingly. Now focusing on both Yam Core Development (Planning) and Yam Infrastructure, then once finished with A. around July i will proceed with the upcoming development while i keep maintaining the Yam Infrastructure.\n\n# Specification\n\nProceeding with an onchain proposal to send E the related comps as specified above.",

Things have changed now that we are no longer in the middle of a bull market, in addition there have been significant changes to Yam DAO and its expenses. Taking these considerations into account to evaluate for long term success of Yam DAO is now more prudent than ever.\nb. Also there are significant limitations for a DAO managed Treasury that personal investment portfolios do not have. Due to my previous work with Yam, Iâve worked thru many of these issues and will be able to give a better comprehensive portfolio.\nMake recommendations based on results from #1.\na. Should we change strategy targets? Maybe move to a % allocation model since crypto in general is highly correlated and there are not any good counter balances to crypto within the guidelines of a DAO Treasury.\nb. What and why are the recommendations appropriate for Yam DAO and the long term future.\nCreate a framework for rebalancing and maintenance of the treasury.\na. Successful treasury management requires maintenance of the assets.\nb. Framework will be a step by step guide with necessary tools to signal for the need to rebalance the treasury and then provide the way to do it.\nc. Framework will need to be adjusted if there are significant changes to the types of assets or expenses of the DAO but general guidelines will be provided.\nSteward recommendations thru Yam governance, adjust if needed and assist in applying changes to Yam Treasury.\nNice to have: Create a framework that is not specific to Yamâs Treasury and can be applied to other treasuries potentially useful to reinvigorate Yamâs DAO house as a service.\n7. Milestones :placard:\nWhat are the steps that you plan to follow to complete this project. Is it one step or multiple? If there are multiple then please list all of them.\n\nAnswer:\n\nRequirements Doc\nEvaluate current investment strategy of a moderately portfolio targeting < 0.75 Beta and < 0.5 Correlation. Make recommendations.\nCreate a framework for rebalancing and maintenance of the treasury.\nSteward recommendations thru Yam governance, adjust if needed and assist in applying changes to Yam Treasury.\n8. YAM / Ecosystem Benefit :blush:\nWhat value does your project add to YAM and the wider ecosystem? How do we measure that benefit?\n\nAnswer:\nSeeing the rise and the correction of crypto in the lens of DAO treasury management since the start of YamV3 has been fascinating. There have been multiple DAOs / protocols who decided to ignore treasury management and are suffering now because of it. Unfortunately crypto as a whole moves in cycles until this is broken, it is prudent to plan around these cycles. In the heat of the moment it is easy to double down when you should be thinking about the worse case scenario.\n**This proposal provides a long term reusable framework that will provide regular rebalancing and flexibility to be used as a base for YAMâs DAO treasury management for many cycles to come. **\n\n9. Funding Request and Breakdown :money_with_wings:\nPlease include the total funding amount that you need and also include a breakdown of how the funds will be used across each part of the project.\n\nAnswer:\nMultiple parts of this proposal will be published publicly with request for feedback. I anticipate the need to work 25 hours a week due to the time it takes for public feedback and Yam governance timing.\n\nAccording to the milestones, my funding request will be:\n\n2 Week â Requirements Doc\na. Publish / Feedback / Snapshot Approval\n4 Weeks - Evaluate current investment strategy of a moderately portfolio targeting < 0.75 Beta and < 0.5 Correlation. Incorporate ideas around protocol owned liquidity and long term governance adjustments. Make recommendations.\na. Publish / Feedback\n8 Weeks - Create a framework for rebalancing and maintenance of the treasury.\na. Publish / Feedback\n4 Weeks - Steward recommendations thru Yam governance, adjust if needed and assist in applying changes to Yam Treasury.\na. Publish / Feedback / Snapshot Approval / On-Chain Approval\nTotal of 18 Weeks / 4.5 Months @ 25 hours a week average @ a rate of $85 per hour. Compensation to be in cadence with monthly on-chain transaction and monthly transparency reports.\n\nFunding request for part 1: Requirements Doc: $4,250. 70% Stables and 30% Yam.\n\n10. Other Information :question:\nImagine youâre a YAM holder. What else do you think we should know about your application?\n\nAnswer:\nThe long term success of Yam is dependent on Yamâs Treasury. With the turn in the market this is the optimal opportunity to create this investment framework for long term success of Yam.",

      "title": "YAM ReOrg Grant-02 Proposal",
      "content": "See link below for full post and conversation around this Grant Request\n\nThis grant application is the second grant within the existing Yam ReOrg Silo. For this grant @Ross and @Designer intend to change from a monthly to a quarterly grant period.\n\nThe purpose of the quarterly grant is to streamline the process on long-term and or ongoing Silo projects. The desired effect is a lighter governance load so both silo participants and token holders are less bogged down in unneeded governance processes.\n\n## Quarterly Grant\n\nThis quarterly (3 month) grant request serves as a funding container. It will work as follows:\n\n- Each silo participant provides an hourly range with a monthly not to exceed maximum\n- At the end of each month transparency reports are filed by the silo participants\n- Payments are paid on a monthly basis based on the actual hours worked\n- Token holders always retain the ability to stop a silo by submitting a Snapshot proposal\n\n## Why Quarterly?\n\nBesides the reduced management overhead, the advantage to the silo structure is that it provides a high level of flexibility for the silo participants to manage their own time and project. The idea is to avoid participant burn out, apathy or abandonment of projects through striking a balance between freedom and accountability. Flexible hourly commitments can encourage long-term participant involvement while providing a mechanism that allows for payment of the work the participant is able to provide each given pay period.\n\nWe think this is a good beta test for this kind of grant structure within an ongoing silo project.\n\n## Goals and Deliverables\n\nOver the 3 month grant period we will focus on refining and documenting the following:\n\n### Design of Core Reorg\n\nRe-Org Docs (YAM RePlanted) and synopsis articles.\n\n- Concise statement of the Yam ReOrg project purpose and main objectives (90% complete)\n- Article 1: What makes a good DAO - documentation that serves as a guiding target (80% complete)\n- Article 2: Goals for a new Yam DAO - success definition and specific goals (80% complete)\n- Article 3: New Yam DAO model - how grants, silos and a gov-ops council will work (50% complete)\n- Diagramming and refinement (30% complete)\n\n#### Milestone 1: \nSubstantial completion of all above to hand off for presentation work by YAM Design Studio Silo on June 27th.\n\nAfter completion of Reorg Docs, Develop Templates for:\n\n- Pre-grant application\n- Project Requirements document\n- Grant Application\n- Counter-Bid document\n- Grant objection document\n\nThese documents to be worked on as part of milestone 2.\n\n### Presentation and Consensus\n\n- Present new Yam DAO model and communication materials once completed by YAM Design Studio. (early-mid July)\n\n- Coordinate with Chilly to present documents and articles on the new supersite website, twitter, medium, etc.\n\n- Respond to questions, concerns, etc.\n\n- Formally present content for review and feedback to confirm consensus among stakeholders.\n\n#### Milestone 2: \nVote to approve new process and more forward into implementation\nSpecification and Implementation\n\n- Based on final consensus, begin the specification and implementation process\n- Implement enough structure for grants process to begin. Refine and publish templates.\n- Specify and begin to implement the Gov-Ops Council.\n- Specification and development of âGovernance Repo,â the location and process for storing and updating new grants and governance proposals.\n\n### Complementary initiatives:\n(to be worked on as time permits)\n\n- Treasury Yield Distribution design\n- Governance contract upgrades\n- Token Issuance strategy and design\n- Vision and Values documentation and ratification\n- Protocol owned liquidity strategy and design\n\nBecause much of the current work is design focused, the work follows an iterative process in which discoveries in later phases may change the design. We expect that the broad strokes of the re-org are complete and ready to be presented at the end of June, and look forward to getting additional feedback. This feedback may impact the final product and require some re-working. The same goes for the design of the complementary initiatives, although the current design for the re-org has been crafted with them in mind.\nFunding Amount Requested:\n\nTotal amount to be split 70% in USDC and 30% in YAM at the 30-day TWAP price on the first day of the month after the month for which compensation is being requested. By Contributor:\n\n### Ross:\n- Range 25 to 35 hrs/week = $8,500 minimum and $11,900 maximum per month\n- (compensation based on $85 per hr)\n\n### Designer:\n- Range 20 to 30 hrs/week = $6,800 minimum and $10,200 maximum per month\n- (compensation based on $85 per hr)\n\nWork on this grant has already begun (beginning of June) so compensation requests in July will be for the entire month.",

      "title": "Was the initial Yambassador grant application malicious?",
      "content": "## Background\nThe Yambassador silo was the first silo approved by the DAO. The original proposal and forum post was up for two weeks before being put to vote and was one of the most active posts in 2022.  Just a week after the vote was approved Ross/galloway.eth put out a proposal that would make the first grant for the silo redundant as a counter. This counter bid was put up for less than 48 hours. This proposal countered the original with a similar scope of work for substantially less money and an accelerated delivery time frame. This proposal passed and another proposal by Ross went up to Retract/ Cancel the Yambassador Grant nearly a month after its approval. This latest vote is ongoing, but it does not address the issue of reimbursing Snake for his contributions. \n\n## Moving forward\n\nThe issue is that Ross didn't just counter the proposal with his own rate. Ross made the claim that the Yambassador silo was malicious in the way that the application was written. He did not provide any evidence to substantiate this claim. He also countered the proposal with below average rates and an unrealistic time frame of two weeks. Evidence of that being it has already been two weeks since the \"Uma delegate voting testing\" proposal and Ross has increased his rate in those two weeks (70 USD/hour -> 85 USD/hour). \n\nI contend that the DAO does not believe that I was malicious by supporting Ross's counter bid. Bids and counter bids should be a part of the grant/silo approval process, but undercutting after a proposal has passed (especially by a core contributor) is in bad form. It undermines the grant and silo process as future participants in the process may hesitate to put forth new ideas and proposals.\n\nI can accept that I was outbid, but it is much more difficult to accept that the DAO is moving forward with my idea yet believe that I was malicious in proposing it. Given the circumstances I believe that I should be compensated for two weeks worth of my time researching, submitting and working on this project at 85/hr. This totals to $6,800 (70/30 Stable/TWAP YAM). The DAO can afford reimbursement, but I believe it cannot afford leaving this matter unresolved.\n\n\nSnake presents the DAO with three options\n- Yambassador was malicious.\n- Yambassador was not malicious, but no reimbursement should be made.\n- Reimburse Snake $6,800 for his work on Yambassador. \n\n",

      "title": "YAM ReOrg Silo and Grant for May 2022",
      "content": "In this application, we intend to create the YAM Re-Org Silo, as well as apply for a grant for the work we are doing on it in May, 2022.\n\nThis Silo aims to build a new framework for the YAM DAO to facilitate better transparency, accountability, and permissionless-ness. It does so by developing a new process by which projects can receive funding. It will clarify the governance process, define and limit the roles of core contributors, and provide an example structure for how funded projects can be run.\n\n## Team\n\nThe main team consists of current YAM contributors @ross, @designer, and @chilly (chilly working under another grant). Contributions from other participants during the next monthâs scope of work who are not mentioned above will be noted and added to next monthâs grant proposal.\n\nAll 3 of us have been working full time at YAM for the last year. We have been part of, and learned from, prior DAO work on governance, branding, and organization, and seen first hand what has worked and what has not.\n\n## Goals and Deliverables\n\nThe Goals of this silo is to upgrade the structure of YAM for the better. We have watched as the DAO has struggled to find its purpose and has struggled to retain mindshare and contributors. We believe that the causes of this are multi-faceted, including a lack of vision around the mission of the DAO, a lack of thought and investment in the core organizational infrastructure of the DAO, an inability to enforce accountability, and confusion around management of projects.\n\nSolving these problems is a large task to undertake and measuring success will require long term tracking. The scope of this grant proposal is to design and implement the first stages of this process to show a proof of concept, as well as educate the wider community about the changes that we are making. Over the next few months, we will work on a number of different pieces and projects that will eventually come together to provide an a complete framework of the new model as well as an example of how the DAO can use this model in the future.\n\nWe have already been working on this project for the last few months and are now ready to transition our working structure to test out the new model. You can review the prior work done by visiting https://yam.super.site and https://yam-reorg-docs.super.site 1\n\nWorking under this silo, we are requesting a grant with the following deliverables that we intend to prepare by early June, 2022 are as follows:\n\n- We will go through the full grant process over the next month. This application is the first step.\n\n- We will further refine the work started in the links above that explains the changes, outlines the process, and provides templates and expectations for creating new grant/silo proposals.\n\nThe work done last month focused on the theory and ideological underpinnings of the changes to the DAO. This month we will focus on refining and documenting the governance structure that is required to make the DAO and grants program run smoothly including:\n\n- Specifying and beginning to implement the Gov-Ops Council.\n\n- Documenting the roles for different stakeholders in governance\n\n- Begin producing in-depth documentation for different parts of the governance process as proposed.\n\n- Further formulate and develop the secondary elements that are impacted by governance decisions (Treasury yield distribution, potential governance upgrades, etc)\n\n- This work will be added to the DAOâs living documentation for those who wish to contribute in the future.\n\nSuccess should be measured by the quality of these documents and their ability to explain the value of the changes that are being made. We expect this documentation to be the foundation for further development and improvement within the DAO.\n\nWe plan to finish and publish deliverables by early June, 2022. We expect that they may exist in a semi-finished state and will require additional work in subsequent months. The deliverables are intended to show progress to YAM token holders.\n\n## Funding Amount Requested: \n\nTotal: $15,875.00, split 70% in USDC and 30% in YAM at the 30-day TWAP price on June 1st. By Contributor:\n\n- Ross - 30 hrs/week = 0.75 * $10,000 full time monthly rate = $7,500\n- Designer - 30 hrs/week = 0.75 * $11,166 full time monthly rate = $8,375\n- Chillzone - Scope of work will be folded under Yam Design Studio Silo and grant.\n\nWork on this grant has already begun (beginning of May) so these amounts are for work done over the entire month of May, even though this proposal is coming toward the middle.\n\nFurther details and discusion in the link below:\n\n",

Yambassadors will be a silo that focuses on standardizing how Yammers participate in the governance of those protocols.\n\nGrant Milestones:\n- Create a proposal contract that allows governance to interact with UMAâs DesignatedVotingFactory and create a new DesignatedVoting contract with governance as owner and me as the initial ambassador. Transfer 500 UMA from treasury to the voting contract.\n- Have the core/infrastructure team review the contract.\n- Deploy proposal contract on Ethereum.\n- Propose the contract to on-chain governance, queue and execute.\n- Participate in at least 1 UMA optimistic oracle vote or dispute.\n- Write a report on said vote and the implications if any to the DAO.\n- Propose governance call to return UMA tokens back to the treasury.\n\nFor more details follow the discussion in the forum post below.\n",

Investing would give a small amount of yield until better yields or investments could be found.\n\n## Specification\nThe YAM treasury (Yam.Finance: Treasury | Address 0x97990b693835da58a281636296d2bf02787dea17 | Etherscan) currently holds ~277.5 WETH.

      "content": "Link to Forum Post here: https://forum.yam.finance/t/yip-101-pause-rari-fuse-pool-implementation/1598\n\n## Basic Summary\n\nA proposal to create and add treasury funds to a new Rari Fuse pool that allows lending and borrowing YAM was approved with YIP-77. This proposal was never implemented due to other more pressing issues. After further discussion, @THEVDM1, @Snake, and I, as well as other contributors, now believe that creating and providing treasury liquidity to this Fuse pool is a risk for the treasury. This is due to a lack of liquidity in our Sushiswap YAM/ETH pool, which would serve as the price oracle for the pool.\nAbstract - What am I proposing?\n\n## Abstract - What am I proposing?\n\nBefore deploying funds to a YAM Fuse pool, we should work to shore up the liquidity in the YAM/ETH sushiswap pool.\n\n## Motivation - Why am I proposing it?\n\n#### Important bits from this section in the forum post:\n\n\"It is clear that the YAM/ETH Sushiswap pool has been suffering declining liquidity over the past few months and as such it provides a much weaker oracle pricing point, which is acutely relevant to the proposed Fuse pool.\"\n\n\"With declining liquidity, price impact of trading has greatly increased and this is what attackers would use to their advantage: they have the ability to greatly influence price if they are reasonably well capitalised.\"\n\n\"Money markets such as Fuse are gas intensive. This prices out smaller users. Gas analysis is done below to prove the point that even if we were to deploy this pool, the user base would be limited to sizable borrowers/lenders only. If the liquidity issue is to be addressed above it is recommended that a whitelisted Fuse fork: Markets.xyz is used on Polygon/Fantom (current deployments) to recreate the pool and its parameters in the future.\"\n\n#### \"Conclusion:\n\nDo not launch the YAM Fuse Pools initially planned as the low liquidity of the YAM/ETH pool imposes too much risk for the utility the pool would have given users.\n\n- Risk of attack through price manipulation causing a loss in treasury assets and user funds\n- Risk of poor liquidation bot coverage due to high price impact on liquidating large borrowers\n- Utility constrained by gas intensive functions required to use the pool\"\n\n## Specification\n\nThere is little that needs to be done to implement this proposal. No further work will be done on the Fuse Pools and no funds will be transferred until a new snapshot vote supercedes this one. In the mean time, contributors and community members should continue to consider ways to improve the liquidity in our YAM/ETH pool.\n",

Shift the requirements to get paid to the contributors by requiring a \"request for compensation on the forum.\" Pay in both stable-coins and YAM will be distributed monthly.\n\n---\n\n### Motivation - Why am I proposing it?\nSee [this post](https://forum.yam.finance/t/contributor-compensation-and-transparency-report-process-change-ideas/1583?u=ross) for the full discussion around the compensation model.\n\nIssues with the current compensation model from the linked post:\n\n- The YAM vesting doesn't work as intended: The idea of the YAM streams was for vesting to occur over a 3 month period. But this implies that the YAM earned for the last month would vested over the next 3 months. Instead, the YAM *to be earned* over the next 3 months is streamed in real time.\n- Accountability requires additional overhead from the HR group.\n- Transparency reports are not seen as important (based on how quickly they are filled out) and require that the HR group coordinates and pesters contributors to fill them out.\n- There is limited ability for contributors to work a flexible schedule that varies from month to month because the rates are set beforehand.\n- There are limited opportunities to do work via different models (bounties, milestone based compensation, etc).\n- YAM voters rely on a small group of contributors to make sure that work is being done efficiently and that all contributors are working effectively. \n- The DAO risks becoming an \"employer,\" which could lead to regulatory issues.\n- Doing all compensation via on-chain transactions via full governance adds overhead and complexity for paying contributors.\n\nMoving to a new model will clarify the interactions between contributors and the DAO, allow more transparency, and pave the way for a more decentralized future for YAM.\n\n---\n\n## Specifications - How am I proposing it is accomplished?\n\nThese changes will need to happen in multiple stages to realize the full benefits of the program. But each stage on its own will yield its own benefits. This proposal is for the first stage.\n\n### Goals\nBefore we get into the full specification, lets lay out what the goals of our contributor compensation program are.\n- The Process should be transparent for contributors and token holders.\n- Contributors should be held accountable for the work they do and not be able to \"game\" the system\n- Contributors should be fairly rewarded for their work.\n- Payment should be incentive aligned.\n- Payments should be for work that has already been done.\n- The process should require as little overhead as possible from contributors and token holders to achieve the above goals\n\n### Stage 1\n\nEnforce the following process for contributors who do work for that DAO:\n1. Those who wish to contribute to the DAO will post to the forum with their initial proposal. It should describe what they plan to work on, expertise, and an hourly rate (guidelines should be provided). This information can be ratified via snapshot voting, and is very similar to the current procedure where a contributor will \"apply\" to governance.\n\n2. At the end of a pay period (monthly), all contributors who have done work that month and wish to get paid will have 7 days (the first week of the new month) to submit a compensation request to the forum, outlining the work that they have done in the prior month and confirming the rate and total amount. These requests are like public timesheets.\n   - The requests will be reviewed before being added to the contributor payment transactions\n   - The requests also serve as transparency reports and give insight into what each contributor has been doing.\n   - Contributors who do not submit a compensation request by the deadline will not be paid in that month's transaction and will have to wait until a later transaction.\n\n3. Upon receipt and review of the reports, contributors will be paid in YAM and Stable-coins for the work they did at their pre-determined rate. Both the Stable-coin and YAM portion of their pay will be paid directly without using a stream. The price of YAM will be determined based on the 30-TWAP determined on the last day of that month. The work to create the on-chain proposal to pay contributors should take no more than 1 week (7 days). \n\n### Prerequisites to implement Stage 1.\n\n  - Determine hourly pay rates for existing contributors and ratify through snapshot.\n  - Create a general hourly pay scale for new contributors to use as a reference for future work.\n  - Create forum post template that contributors can use to submit requests for compensation.\n  - Create documents to clarify this process for contributors, developers, and community.\n\n### Addendum\nThe above is the scope of work for this stage of the update. Future stages could include:\n- Creating a multi-sig to pay contributors from.\n- Creating an optimistic governance process for the contributor payment multi-sig to allow more oversight from token holders.\n- Re-implementation of streams in a more incentive aligned and impactful way.",

      "title": "Polygon Multisig Signer Update",
      "content": "### Basic Summary\n\nWe need to provide liquidity to our New LSP synths on Polygon when they are ready. In order to do this we must set funds from the treasury, which lives on Ethereum mainnet to polygon, and then manage those funds there. Those funds will be managed with the existing multi-sig that we have deployed on Polygon. In order to increase security, we should upgrade the multi-sig from 2-3 to 3-5.\n\n### Abstract - What am I proposing?\n\nWhile we work on a longer term, and more decentralized solution, I propose that we send all funds that we plan to use for Polygon liquidity to our existing Polygon multi-sig (https://polygonscan.com/address/0x5553b79f4ee172e76537fd6a43629c44f6034f18) and use it to perform all actions necessary to provide liquidity for Yam Synths.\n\nAt the same time, in order to improve the security of this wallet, we should upgrade it from a 2-3 multi-sig to a 3-5 multi-sig.\n\nThe current signers for the multi-sig are @ethe, @flygoing.eth, and @HodlDwon. I propose we expand that list to include @ross and @Snake.\n\n### Motivation - Why am I proposing it?\n\nThere is easy way to extend the governance functionality that we currently use on Ethereum L1 onto polygon. There are some new solutions available that may work for the task, but they are not going to be possible to implement in the timeframe needed to perform the liquidity allocation mentioned above. We currently have a multi-sig on polygon that we can use. Because the amount of money that it will control is higher than what was previously assumed for the comethSwap program (what it was approved for), I am recommending we add 2 additional signers to increase security.\n\nAll signers are on, or have in the past been on the core team and are known around the community.\n\n### Specifications\n\nIn order to update the multi-sig, the existing signers would need to modify the existing multi-sig to add the 2 new signers.\n\n**Writer: @Ross**",

      "content": "Forum Post: https://forum.yam.finance/t/yip-91-yam-synths-polygon-liquidity-strategy/1551\n\n### Basic Summary\nWe need to provide liquidity to our New LSP synths on Polygon when they are ready (expected early November 2021). In order to do this we must set funds from the treasury, which lives on Ethereum mainnet to polygon, and then manage those funds there\n\n### Abstract - What am I proposing?\n#### Liquidity allocation\nIn continuation of the asset allocation from [YIP-83](https://forum.yam.finance/t/yip-83-re-allocation-of-assets-post-rebalancing/1518), I propose that we send 130 ETH and $1.1M in stablecoins to provide liquidity for our new synths on Polygon.\n\n### Motivation - Why am I proposing it?\nWe are launching new Synths on polygon as part of a rollout of our new DeFi-Tools product line. We need to continue bootstrapping these pools to grow the Yam Synths product. At the same time, utilizing these funds in our synths earns UMA rewards for the treasury. Yam Synths products are currently earning ~49% APR on ETH, and we can expect similar (most likely higher) returns on the funds we invest. I will have another post soon that goes over liquidity mining on polygon with the new LSP contracts. But the gist is it is easier and more capital efficient than the current model and should pay out higher APRs that currently, up to ~$20M in TVL.   \n\n### Specifications - How am I proposing it is accomplished?\nProposed Treasury Funds to be moved to Polygon multi-sig:\n130 ETH to be deployed to the 2xDPI synth\n$1.1 M USD to be deployed, split between to the Sushiswap APR Synth and 50x IL synth.\nTotal is ~$1.6M dollars based on prices from 10/22/2021",

      "content": "### Basic Summary\nWe need to provide liquidity to our New LSP synths on Polygon when they are ready. In order to do this we must set funds from the treasury, which lives on Ethereum mainnet to polygon, and then manage those funds there. Those funds will be managed with the existing multi-sig that we have deployed on Polygon. In order to increase security, we should upgrade the multi-sig from 2-3 to 3-5.\n\n### Abstract - What am I proposing?\nWhile we work on a longer term, and more decentralized solution, I propose that we send all funds that we plan to use for Polygon liquidity to our existing Polygon multi-sig (https://polygonscan.com/address/0x5553b79f4ee172e76537fd6a43629c44f6034f18) and use it to perform all actions necessary to provide liquidity for Yam Synths.\n\nAt the same time, in order to improve the security of this wallet, we should upgrade it from a 2-3 multi-sig to a 3-5 multi-sig. \n\nThe current signers for the multi-sig are @ethe, @flygoing.eth, and @HodlDwon. I propose we expand that list to include @ross and @Snake. \n\n### Motivation - Why am I proposing it?\nThere is easy way to extend the governance functionality that we currently use on Ethereum L1 onto polygon. There are some new solutions available that may work for the task, but they are not going to be possible to implement in the timeframe needed to perform the liquidity allocation mentioned above. We currently have a multi-sig on polygon that we can use. Because the amount of money that it will control is higher than what was previously assumed for the comethSwap program (what it was approved for), I am recommending we add 2 additional signers to increase security.\n\nAll signers are on, or have in the past been on the core team and are known around the community.\n\n### Specifications\nIn order to update the multi-sig, the existing signers would need to modify the existing multi-sig to add the 2 new signers.",

      "content": "Forum Post describing this Proposal: https://forum.yam.finance/t/jason-punk1004-eth-incident-and-votes/1554\n\n### Introduction\n\nPer this announcement, https://yamfinance.medium.com/3f5f74af044d, Jason, aka punk1004.eth, has been removed as a contributor to YAM and had all permissions removed from github.\n\nHere is the conclusion that the YAM core team has come to after reviewing all the evidence that was presented to us (copied from the statement made on Medium):\n\n1. There are multiple connections between the contributorâs public wallets and the exploiting (bad actor) wallets.\n2. There are multiple connections between the contributorâs public github account and the second github account that was used to do work on these other projects that had funds stolen from them.\n3. There are connections between the contributorâs github account and Ethereum wallets to other github accounts and other Ethereum wallets that have worked on, deployed, or been the recipient of funds from projects that many would consider to be scams, or at the very least, suspicious.\n4. There is circumstantial evidence including chats and a voice recording that seem to match characteristics of the contributor.\n5. The distinction of whether this contributor was personally responsible for these actions or unwittingly caught up in the actions of other individuals ultimately does not matter. Their involvement shows extremely bad judgement and is a serious security risk for YAM.\n\nThere are additional decisions that need to be made regarding the payment for previous work Jason has done and continued membership on our discord that need to be answered by the YAM community.\n\n### Abstract\nContributors are paid in both stablecoins and YAM based on their approved compensation proposals. The YAM is streamed over 3 months and the stablecoins are paid retroactively every month for work done over the past month. Jasonâs YAM stream has ended and will not be renewed. His payment in stablecoins typically would be paid in the monthly on-chain vote with the rest of the contributorâs payments.\n\nThe question here is whether the DAO thinks that Jason should receive payment for his last month of work. He has performed the work and tasks that he was given over the last month, and the exploit of which he is accused occurred on the 3rd of November, after the period of work for which he would be paid.\n\n### Motivation\nThese decisions are either beyond the scope of what the core contributors believe they should be deciding upon or are unclear on the best course of action. We feel our best way forward is to put these questions to the DAO as a whole and follow the will of the YAM token holders.\n\n### Specifications\nThe outcome of this vote will be followed by the contributors with the power to carry them out.\n\n- If the vote to pay Jason is successful, he will be paid for his work done in October in the next on-chain proposal\n- If the vote to pay Jason is unsuccessful, we will not be included the next on chain proposal.\n- If the vote fails to meet quorum then Jason will be paid for his work done in October in the next on-chain vote.\n",

      "content": "Forum Post: https://forum.yam.finance/t/yip-86-using-profit-to-buyback-and-build/1531\n\n## introduction\n\nThe goal of YAM is to build a community who will use the treasury to build new DeFi and crypto products that will generate revenues. Beyond just generating these revenues, how they are allocated is a important consideration. With the passing of [YIP-80](https://forum.yam.finance/t/yip-80-yam-treasury-rebalancing/1512), we have taken a big step creating a foundation on which we can build. Rebalancing and rationalizing the treasury is only the first step in building a strong foundation for YAM.\n\nThere have been numerous calls for a revenue/profit distribution mechanism that benefits YAM token holders, and with a solidified model for treasury management we can now reason about how a mechanism might work.\n\nAs we are still an early stage project, any distribution mechanism should only consider profit (revenues minus expenses and returns). YAM has quarterly report in which we enumerate the inflows and outflows from the DAO. The most recent one can be seen here: \n[Yam Treasury Quarterly Report - Q2 2021](https://medium.com/yam-finance/yam-treasury-quarterly-report-q2-2021-23f56a758c87)\n\nUsing this information we can develop a plan to create a sustainable model to use profits to fund further growth and development.\n\n## Methodology\n\nBeyond just looking at profits and expenses for the quarter, we also need to adjust for the overall performance of the treasury between quarters. If the treasury is shrinking then there is no profit, even if our operating revenues are larger than our operating expenses. This is important because it should incentivize YAM holders to manage the treasury in a way that limits investment risk and still rewards investment growth. It also promotes revenue growth since that should be less influenced by market cycles.\n\nThere are a few metrics we can use to determine whether the DAO is profitable: Overall growth of the treasury or the difference between product revenues and DAO expenses. I believe treasury growth is the primary metric that we should use. This means that, in the context of this buyback, if the treasury did not grow in the most recent quarter then no profits were realized, even if product revenues outpaced expenses. This is the most holistic way to approach the mechanism. \n\nWe can combine a profit buyback mechanism with our need to fund the treasury with YAM to pay contributors. This would create a system where a percentage of profits are use to buy YAM off the open market, which are then used for contributor payments and incentive programs. This model, combined with the ability of the DAO to mint new YAM, provides a framework for which YamDAO can use profits generated to fund itself while also indirectly rewarding token holders, and provide a path to even eventually remove YAM from circulation.\n\n## How it would Work\nSee the Forum post here for a full write-up of the methodology: https://forum.yam.finance/t/yip-86-using-profit-to-buyback-and-build/1531\n\n### Other factors\nThis model creates a number of levers through which governance can influence the project treasury and monetary policy while still prioritizing treasury and project growth. Governance would need to:\n\n1. Determine reasonable payroll and runway figures for contributor compensation. Because YAM may be minted for payroll, this is a parameter that needs to be managed. This includes setting maximum total salaries and the maximum amount of stablecoins that contributors can earn as a portion of their pay. \n2. Determine how much YAM is needed for incentive programs.\n3. Set a max yearly or quarterly YAM issuance rate for the treasury to limit overall YAM issuance.\n4. Determine the appropriate risk level for the Treasury per YIP-80\n5. Determine the `productProfitReinvestment` and `investmentProfitReinvestment` variables to set how much profit is used to buy YAM.\n\nThese different parameters will be in included in upcoming snapshot votes. This vote is intended to ratify the general concept and methodology, with further details determined in future votes.\n",

Thats a new model i am experimenting with currently at Yam synths and its showing good results so far.\n> Allocating a maxed out amount of $10k/month in stablecoin for this matter. Noting, currently the amount that will be paid out to resources is quite less than 10k/month, adding a flexible gap for future needs.\n\n## **Services**\n@e: While managing everything related to services that yam uses from servers, github, websites and other infrastructure requirements, in some cases there are needs to take immediate actions, where it wouldnt work with the multisig as it requires time to finalize transactions. Normally i use my personal funds to facilitate this, thats alright, but since its also resulting in extra unwanted gas costs, i would like to handle this differently.\n> Allocating a maxed out amount of $5k/month in stablecoin for this matter. Noting, currently the amount thats being used for services is less than 2k/month, adding a flexible gap for future needs.\n\n**Note:** Everything related will be treated as a multisig transaction as how its been going, transparent; for it to be included in the quarterly transparency reports.\n\n# **Specifications**\nIf this proposal succeeds, the mentioned stablecoin value will be transferred and topped up once needed from the multisig to E.",

      "content": "\n### Abstract \n\nThis is a proposal to create an new internal group of contributors who will meet monthly and is empowered to make staffing decisions, propose new hires, propose pay changes, and propose removal of contributors.\n\nThe goal of this group is to streamline the contribution process and provide a resource for all contributors to better understand what is expected of them and clear up any problems that arise. It will serve as the primary interface between contributors and governance in matters of compensation and employment.\n### Motivation \n\nThe current structure to organize contributors and keep them accountable is not clearly defined. Contributors apply directly to governance to be hired/paid but they typically discuss this beforehand with the existing contributors to determine what their proposal should look like. This process is informal and has typically been done by members of the operations guild. This proposal formalizes what is already happening and makes it clear for all parties.\n\n#### Hiring\nThe HR group will formalize the arrangement for new contributors who are looking to be hired with the support of the existing contributors. It will provide a way for the current contributors to signal to governance about whether they think a hire is necessary and beneficial.\n\n#### Compensation Changes\nIn order to streamline compensation updates for contributors, the HR group will compile and propose compensation updates to present to governance for approval. This will typically happen on 6 month intervals as streams complete, but there may be other requested updates in between.\n\n#### Firing\nThis model provides a framework for governance to get information about contributors who are not performing as specified in their proposals to be removed or have their compensation adjusted. This information is not easily available for YAM token holders. The HR group will make recommendations about compensation changes or removing contributors who are not living up the the standards of the DAO.\n### Specifications \n\nSpecifications for this are soft as this is an organizational change. Unless specifically disapproved, this group will begin work immediately.\n\n- This group will meet monthly at minimum to discuss HR and staffing needs for the DAO.\n- This group will make recommendations to governance on Hiring and HR decisions. YAM holders still need to discuss and approve these recommendations.\n- Approval from the HR group is not required to be hired by the DAO. Anyone can appeal directly to governance. Contributors who are recommended for firing can also appeal directly to governance.\n- This group with start with 4 members and 1 alternate (to break any deadlock)\n- There is a 1 year term limit for members of this group. They can serve more than 1 term, but must be ratified for future terms.\n- Group members are initially put forward by existing contributors\n   - Proposed contributors for the first term are 0xE, Natew, Chillzone, and Ross, with the alternate being Feddas.\n- Being a member of the HR group does not pay extra or have any added benefits.\n",

      "content": "See the forum post here: https://forum.yam.finance/t/yip-84-update-to-contributor-compensation-guidelines/1527\n\n### Introduction\nThis is a proposal to update the contributor compensation framework for those who are working full and part-time for YAM. It increases the % of pay that can be received in stable-coins and changes the vesting period for YAM earned.\n\nTo understand what is changing, I recommend reading this post: https://forum.yam.finance/t/analysis-of-current-compensation-model/1526\n\n### Goals\n\nI propose to create a more standard and simple model where contributors can elect to be paid mainly in stable-coins, up to a predetermined cap, while always maintaining a portion of their pay in vested YAM. The core goals of this proposal are:\n\n1. Contributors being able to pay their bills.\n2. Contributors core pay not being affected by market fluctuations (unless they want it to).\n3. Making sure contributors have some of their income exposure in Yam to help align and incentivize.\n\n### Details\n\n- Pay will continue to be broken down into 2 portions: Stablecoins and YAM.\n   \n   1. All contributors will be able to take up to 70% of their pay in stablecoins. This is their base pay and is expected to be sufficient for the contributor to pay their bills. This will be paid in the stablecoins, either DAI or USDC.\n   2. The rest is an incentive payment in YAM, which has a new vesting graded vesting of 6 months similar to how SNX rewards are vested (linear vesting begins 6 months after YAM is earned).YAM is deposited into the stream at the beginning of the 6 month period and is inaccessible for 6 months. Once the 6 month mark has been hit, the stream starts and the funds are released over the next 6 months.\n- YAM quantities paid out will be determined based on a 1month TWAP similar to how it is currently done, but streams will be funded on 6 month intervals (same length as vesting start).\n- If a contributor wants to receive a larger percentage of their pay in YAM, they can do so without vesting (30% will always be vested). We expect that contributors who do this will not sell their YAM immediately.\n\n### Implementation\n\nThis proposal is to create a framework which we will then apply the current contributors as streams end and need to be updated. After discussion, this framework will be put up for a snapshot vote. Once approved, a separate proposal will be made to apply the changes to contributors. Assuming it is approved before Oct. 1st, then it would be applied to the contributors whose streams end then. âOGâ contributors streams end in December and these changes would applied at that point.\n\nThe stream mechanism may need to be updated to allow for the 6 month delay in vesting. Dev work will be coordinated to make that happen.",

In making the following recommendations, we will use the post on [Treasury Management Framework 3](https://forum.yam.finance/t/yam-treasury-management-framework/1511) as guidance.\n\n## Action Items\nAfter Rebalancing, move:\n- ~$400,000 USD worth of ETH into uPUNKS.\n- ~$1,000,000 USD worth of ETH into uGAS.\n- ~$1,000,000 USDC into uSTONKS.\n- ~$400,000 worth of ETH, and $400,000 worth of DPI into the Uniswap v2 pool.\n- ~$80,0000 worth of ETH and $255,000 in USDC to our new fuse pools according to this [post](https://forum.yam.finance/t/yip-77-bootstrapping-yam-fuse-pools/1504/5?u=rossgalloway).\n- ~$467,000 worth of DPI, ~560,000 USDC, and ~$840,000 ETH (some existing WBTC will be included in this number) to YDS.\n- ~$10,000 worth of ETH and $100,000 USDC to the Multi-sig.\n- The rest of the ETH and DPI will live in the general treasury (or other governance controlled wallets at the discretion of @flygoing.eth).\n- Other assets (Index, UMA, xSushi, GTC, MUST) will stay where they are.\n- Stablecoins held in the general treasury wallet will be converted to yDAI per [YIP-82](https://snapshot.org/#/yam.eth/proposal/QmRwUZdc4B7qP9Kfp7GtggRVunoydMVzqLaLkM6qc58ZXr).\n\n**Writer: @Ross**",

We expect this to roughly double the amount of stable-coins in the treasury. If there is a large change in the market before the on-chain vote then these numbers may change slightly to meet the risk criteria  outlined above. \n",

      "content": "See the forum post here for the full post and discussion: https://forum.yam.finance/t/yip-81-remove-strategic-assets-from-yds/1513\n\n## Basic Summary\n\nRestructure the Yam DAO Set so that it does nor include our strategic assets.\n\n## Abstract\n\nI propose that we limit the assets within the Yam DAO Set to only those that can be easily re-balanced without worrying about strategic uses. This would change the current YDS make-up to only include ETH, Stables, DPI, and WBTC. The SUSHI, UMA, and INDEX included in the set now would be moved into the treasury proper with the rest of those tokens\nMotivation\n\n### Advantages:\n- This simplifies the re-balancing process for the Treasury and moves the onus of rebalancing our strategic assets to the larger treasury management process. \n- It will be easier for anyone to buy this SET since we can use NAV issuance to allow buyers to enter with one asset.\n- If YDS that does not contain the tokens of projects that we are working with, it will have a larger addressable market and could be marketed to DAOs as a simple diversified treasury management tool.\n\n## Specifications\n\nRemove the specified assets from the Yam DAO Set. This may entail selling to ETH to exit, and re-buying the assets for the treasury. Some assets may not need to be re-bought if YIP-80 passes, as they are already above our desired allocation percentages.\n\nYDS TokenSets Page: TokenSets - Asset Management Simplified 1\nContract: Set: Yam DAO House | 0xd83dfe003e7c42077186d690dd3d24a0c965ca4e\n\nCurrent Strategic assets in the YDS:\n~ 1810 INDEX - could be sold for USD if YIP-80 passes\n~ 2930 SUSHI - could be sold for USD if YIP-80 passes\n~ 1552 UMA - moved to Treasury\n\nAssuming both proposals pass, this will be done in conjunction with the treasury re-balancing.",

      "content": "**YIP-78 Remove The Great Yam Wall**\nForum Post here: https://forum.yam.finance/t/yip-79-remove-the-great-yam-wall/1502\n\n**Basic Summary**\nThe Great YAM Wall is bad for long term holders and sacrifices the health of the treasury for the gain of those looking to sell their YAM. We should remove it. \n\n**Abstract**\nI have written a long explanation of why the Great YAM wall is a ineffective and counterproductive mechanism here: https://forum.yam.finance/t/tear-down-the-great-yam-wall/1494\n\nTL:DR\n- The Great YAM Wall was designed around the rebasing mechanism for YAM, which is no longer active, and because of that the core principals of it are no longer valid.\n- The \"value\" of YAM comes from the community and core contributors using the treasury to build products that return value via revenues to the DAO. The GYW reduces our ability to do this by using assets that are productive to buy assets which are not productive. (YAM is not \"productive\" for the treasury because it cannot sell it or use it to make money. By using it for expenses we are further depressing the price.)\n- There is little evidence that it will make any difference to the price in the long run as those who were looking to sell anyway do so at the expense of the treasury. \n- Other one time buy back examples (sushi, dxDAO) have not been effective in impacting the price of the token at all.\n- We can design a better mechanism that benefits long term YAM holders and aligns the incentives of the community and contributors.\n\n**Motivation**\nI believe in what we are building at YAM. I know the rest of the core team do to. We view what we are doing as a marathon and not a sprint, and we should structure our decisions around that viewpoint. While the YAM price is important in the long run, selling off the treasury to make a short term impact on the price is like running a sprint in the middle of a marathon. It is pointless at best and counterproductive at worst.\n\nWe removed the rebase mechanism to pave the way for a better YAM. We should do the same with the Great YAM Wall.\n\n**Specifications**\nThere is no current in-code implementation for the Great Yam Wall now, so there is no active change that needs to be made.\n",

      "content": "**Yam Dao has been whitelisted as a âFuse Pool Creatorâ:**\nhttps://snapshot.org/#/rari/proposal/QmdNYSDUdojyAREMf2hzf2nEw7iRTSbvrSsVr4hWX2LHG5\n\nRari Capitalâs Fuse product, allows for the creation of custom lending/borrowing markets which are parameterised by the pool creators, in our case this would be Yam Dao. By creating a Fuse pool centered around the YAM token the community can reap the following benefits:\n\n**Increase token utility:**\n\nBorrow stablecoins against YAM collateral\nBorrow YAM or YAM/ETH SLP against stables to farm without price risk\nBorrow YAM or YAM/ETH SLP against stables to hedge YAM positions\n\n**Make YAM a yield bearing asset:**\n\nExisting YAM or newly minted YAM would be yield bearing if deposited into a Fuse pool maintained by Yam.\n\n**Earn yield on a portion of treasury assets:**\n\nAny Treasury assets deposited into the pool would also become yield bearing\n\n**Earn Fuse Pool admin fees:**\n\nRari have agreed to pay 20% of the initial Fuse Pool admin fee to the Yam treasury (this fee is charged at 10% of interest earned within the pool)\n\nBenefits aside, Fuse pools come with standard lending/borrow market tail risks that are common across Defi, some examples:\n\nOracle manipulation (TWAPâs are used, increasing the risk and cost of performing this attack)\nImperfect liquidation system in times of extreme volatility\n\nYam Dao has engaged with Rari to advise on setting up these pools to be as secure as possible. It is noteworthy that to date no Fuse Pool has been exploited.\n\n**Pool Specifications:**\n\nThe initial Fuse Pools would consist of the following assets:\n\nYAM\nUSDC\nDAI\nYAM/ETH SLP\n\nAs YAM and YAM/ETH LP are lower liquidity tokens and more sensitive to large price movements, two separate pools will be created to isolate this risk. The first and larger pool will include all assets listed but only allow the lower liquidity tokens as collateral, and a smaller second pool consisting only of these two tokens where they are both borrowable and allowed as collateral will be created. Both pools are necessary to reap all the benefits listed above.\n\n**Action Required:**\n\nTo create a liquid lending/borrow market for Yam token holders in the form of a Fuse Pool, bootstrapping liquidity is necessary. If we consider Yam Daoâs asset base to be treasury funds + contributor vesting poolâs YAM, we arrive at the figure of $5.36M + $907K = $6.27M at the time of writing. It is initially proposed that we deposit 8% of Yamâs asset base into the initial Fuse pools.\n\nThis is enough to create a liquid market, but not too large a sum that in a black swan event that we havenât seen before would severely impact the treasury. 8% of the current asset base would amount to $500k. The full amount would become interest earning once borrowers take out loans, and Yam dao can chose to withdraw these funds at any time in the future (less current amounts loaned out which can be withdrawn once repaid)\n\nIt is important to note that a large portion of this amount would be YAM. Which can be sourced from the existing YAM in the contributor vesting pool or can be sourced by minting new YAM. Please note that this choice is included in the voting options.\n\nThe non YAM portion would need to be sourced from the treasury. If this proposal is to be implemented, these funds would be secured by using existing treasury assets and selling Sushi and DPI tokens, as they are the most outsized positions relative to the rest of the treasury as indicated in the July treasury report.\n\n\n",

      "content": "Author: Feddas\nForum Post: https://forum.yam.finance/t/delegating-uni-and-index-governance-votes-to-get-approval-to-build-uni-kpi-options/1487\n\n## **Basic Summary**\n\nThe goal of this proposal is to delegate voting of the $INDEX tokens in the treasury to:\n\n**iyamfeddas.eth** \n\nfor Yam to help submit and approve a proposal to build KPI options for Uniswap's community treasury which holds over $2 Billion in UNI tokens. Here's the original governance forum post: \n[https://gov.uniswap.org/t/temperature-check-should-we-be-managing-systemic-risk-in-uniswaps-community-treasury-using-kpi-options/12624](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/temperature-check-should-we-be-managing-systemic-risk-in-uniswaps-community-treasury-using-kpi-options/12624)\n\n## **Abstract**\n\nYam.Finance team and UMA team is asking for help in consolidating our $UNI votes and $INDEX votes to iyamfeddas.eth so that we can:\n\n1. Assist Uniswap to divest their community treasury by utilizing KPI options.\n    1. In order to do so we need to go through their governance process. Which require 3 different votes each with higher quorum requirements (25k / 50k / 40m). \n2. $INDEX tokens can be used to vote on Defi Pulse Index meta proposals which has a significant number of $UNI votes. \n3. Can also support future initiatives that might be mutually beneficial for Yam / UMA and partners. \n\n## **Background**\n\nFeddas is directly in charge of Yam Treasuries, a treasury management as a service by Yam. Yam TreasuriesÂ has been leading the charge on treasury management for DAOs. Weâve realized that there are significant systemic risks for DAOâs treasuries. During the bear market of 2017 multiple projects were forced to sell their treasury at historically low values, which ultimately caused many of them to disband and shutter.\n\nTreasury management is mission critical for DAOs, yet the challenges and complexities are formidable. Sushi realized this systemic issue and collaborated withÂ [Yam.Finance](http://yam.finance/)Â to build a custom treasury management solution called sushiHOUSE:Â [https://forum.sushi.com/t/sushihouse-a-treasury-management-proposal/3106Â 1](https://forum.sushi.com/t/sushihouse-a-treasury-management-proposal/3106)\n\n## **Motivation**\n\nGovernance is a very challenging issue in DAOs. DAO governance participation is usually very low on the list of priorities for most stakeholders. As a long term stakeholder of a project, its not that you don't care about the governing the protocol but it's usually two reasons that keep you from participation:\n\n1. Lack of time to fully understand the proposals or even the time to read and follow.\n2. Thinking that your participation doesn't really matter. \n\nVote delegation helps solve these two issues and will directly help in building out the Yam and UMA ecosystem. \n\n## **How to Delegate your $UNI votes**\n\nStep 1: go to [https://app.uniswap.org/#/vote](https://app.uniswap.org/#/vote)\n\nStep 2: click on edit\n\n![https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/b3fdbebb-63be-4287-a81b-67166f957c8e/Untitled.png](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/b3fdbebb-63be-4287-a81b-67166f957c8e/Untitled.png)\n\nStep 3: Add Delegate +\n\n![https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/3a8038a8-8baa-4fa0-a2f9-f25a57e67d6b/Untitled.png](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/3a8038a8-8baa-4fa0-a2f9-f25a57e67d6b/Untitled.png)\n\nStep 4: Delegate to iyamfeddas.eth (all lowercase)\n\n![https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/9ec364f1-0acc-44cc-adc1-55c152c9e41b/Untitled.png](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/9ec364f1-0acc-44cc-adc1-55c152c9e41b/Untitled.png)\n\nStep 5: Confirm Transaction! Your done, now each phase of the voting can be done by Feddas.\n",

I operate in the intersection of customer success, product marketing, technical architecture, and business intelligence; all of which are needed to build incredible products. Iâve led my team from a third-world country to a global scale with international partners and backers. My skills involve full stack development, product design, and marketing. These have helped me build, launch, and scale lots of fun products in the past, for myself (as side projects) and my team.

The index value is calculated by computing the median transfer price of all CryptoPunks transferred over the last 30-days before expiry of synthetic. UMA will be providing 10,000 UMA tokens as rewards for the first two weeks after launch of uPUNKS on Yam Synths (previously known as Degenerative.finance). \n\nThis proposal will provide an additional 10,000 $YAM tokens as rewards over 2 weeks after the first 2 weeks of additional 10,000 $UMA rewards for Minters and LPers of uPUNKS to promote an active and strong market. This proposal will also implement a multi-sig for distribution of rewards weekly vs our current implementation is to distribute monthly via on-chain vote transaction. \nFor more information on uPUNKS: https://medium.com/uma-project/ulabs-cryptopunks-synthetic-token-upunk-25d9d97600c3\n\n\n### Abstract\nThis proposal will provide an additional 10,000 $YAM tokens as rewards over 2 weeks after the first 2 weeks of additional 10,000 $UMA rewards for Minters and LPers of uPUNKS to promote an active and strong market. \n$Yam rewards will be provided from the incentive mining pool that has been already setup for farming incentives. No additional YAMs will be minted beyond what has been allocated for the incentive pool. \n\n### Specifications\nThe plan for additional $Yam rewards distribution. \n$UMA Rewards will start at launch of Yam Synths new website with the launch of the uPUNKS synthetic. Announcement will be made before hand via @Yam.Finance twitter and on discord. \n\n$UMA rewards will last for 2 weeks, then afterwards anyone still staked and LPed will receive their pro-rata share of the 10,000 $YAM rewards from this proposal. \n\n* The plan for multisig weekly distribution of UMA and YAM rewards for all synthetics minted on Yam Synths website. \n* A 3 of 5 gnosis multi-sig will be created to distribute all rewards. \n* Signers of the multi-sig will consist of multiple contributors: \n@natew, @0xE, @will, @KW710, @byte\n",

These are the most popular and generally considered to be most reputable exchanges around. *note: Payout occurs only if Safu funds or the exchangeâs insurance do not cover losses.\n* (2) Hardware Wallet companies, Ledger and Trezor, including the Ledger Nano S and X, and the Trezor Model T and One. This would cover large scale exploits in their hardware or firmware and would not cover individual loss due to phishing or poor security.\n\n### Option 2: Hot New Projects MetaPool\n\nThis pool targets newer projects on Ethereum that are considered reputable and have high TVL but are less battle tested and therefore may be more risky. While they may be more risky, this may mean that there is more demand for coverage for them in the market. This list is preliminary but internal discussions considered including:\n\n * Alchemix\n*  OHM\n*  Liquity\n*  FEI\n*  Integral\n*  Reflexer\n\n### Option 3: Integrated DegenV2 MetaPool\n\nThis last option focuses more closely on YAM products, specifically DegenV2 and the constituent protocols that it uses. This option would let us insure our own users and potentially test out our products in a more limited environment. The covered protocols would be:\n\n * UMA\n * Sushiswap/Uniswap depending on where our pools live\n * Any YAM contracts that are used\n *  Any future contracts included in future versions of Degen.\n\n### Choose wisely!\n",

      "title": "YIP-62 Proposal: Treasury Providing Liquidity for Comethswap L2 $YAM/$MUST Pool on Polygon",
      "content": "**Basic Summary**\n\nComethswap is an L2 DEX on Polygon (fka Matic) belonging to the blockchain game Cometh. Yam has been running a promotional campaign with Cometh to create unique Yam-themed spaceship NFTs for use within their game based on designs submitted by the Yam Community. There will be a total of four NFT Yam spaceships.\n\nShortly after the conclusion of the promotional event, Cometh will launch a $YAM/$MUST pool on their ComethSwap DEX and incentivize it with $MUST rewards. At the same time, the Yam fleet NFTs will become available on OpenSea or via Cometh. The estimated launch is around May 3rd, 2021.\n\n**Abstract**\n\nYam and Cometh will do a token exchange where Yam will provide Cometh with $25K in $YAM tokens in exchange for $25K in $MUST tokens. Cometh will then pair an additional $25K in $MUST tokens with the $YAM it received to seed the initial liquidity for the $YAM/$MUST pool on ComethSwap. Yam will then supplement that liquidity with the $25K in $MUST tokens plus an additional $25K in $YAM tokens to bring the total pool value to $100K at the start of the incentivized liquidity mining event.\n\nCometh will incentivize the $YAM/$MUST pool with additional $MUST token rewards. Additionally, the proceeds of the Yam fleet spaceship NFT sales will be used by Cometh to market buy additional $YAM to add to the liquidity held in the pool.\n\nSince Yam does not hold $YAM tokens in its treasury, we will need to use $yUSD to purchase $YAM off the market.\n\n**Motivation**\n\nThis campaign has several benefits:\n\n- ComethSwap will become the $YAM tokenâs first listing on an L2 DEX allowing for trading with minimal gas fees. This will serve as an experiment for future L2 listings.\n- This will be Yamâs first âbuy backâ event and will serve as an experiment regarding future $YAM token buy backs for exchange listings in the future.\n- The initial market purchase of $YAM for $yUSD may have a small positive spot price impact on the $YAM token.\n- The use of the Yam fleet NFT sales revenue to purchase $YAM may create additional buying pressure on $YAM.\n- Using the proceeds from the NFT sale to supply liquidity to the ComethSwap pool allows Yam to deepen the liquidity on the DEX without the need to mint additional $YAM (inflation) or the need to expend too much in treasury funds.\n- This liquidity mining event will benefit $YAM token holders who chose to provide liquidity through earning $MUST rewards.\n- This promotion will bring added visibility and positive brand awareness for Yam and its products.\n\n**Specifications**\n\nThis proposal follows the best practices suggested by Cometh and used with other participating protocols.\n\n1.  $50k yUSD in treasury will be sold into $ETH. If it benefits the trade, the 2.  $yUSD will be unwrapped into $USDC, and then the USDC will be sold for $ETH.\n3.  The $50K ETH will be sold for $YAM through the Sushiswap liquidity pool.\n4.  $25K YAM will be provided to Cometh for initial pool liquidity in exchange for $25K MUST.\n5.  Yam will migrate the remaining $25K YAM and $25K MUST from the Ethereum L1 blockchain to the Polygon L2 blockchain.\n6.  Yam will deposit the remaining $25K YAM / $25K MUST into the 7. \n $YAM/$MUST liquidity pool on ComethSwap created earlier.\n\nTotal initial liquidity in the $YAM/$MUST pool will be $100K.\n\n**Voting Choices**\n\n1.  Yes, spend $50k yUSD from the Treasury to supply liquidity to the YAM/MUST pool on ComethSwap.\n2.  No, don't spend $50k yUSD from the Treasury to supply liquidity to the YAM/MUST pool on ComethSwap.",

Strong grasp of Defi ecosystem and UMAâs synthetic asset framework. Solid coding knowledge included. Managing digital asset portfolios and arbitrage strategies since 2016.\n\nMy last job (resigned last month) was in Portfolio Analytics within the Data Insight team at a FTSE100 London Asset Manager where I was tasked with enriching data for actionable insight in managing investments. Before this I was working at a boutique asset and wealth management firm as a Portfolio Analyst and Wealth Manager. I have also passed all levels of the CFA program (respected Masters equivalent investment analyst qualification), have a Post Grad in Financial Planning and a base degree in Investment Management.\n\n#### What Iâve done for Yam in the last month:\n\n* Designed yieldYam ð¨âð¾ð  (in development)\n  * Un-liquidatable and to be the highest UMA yielding product in the synthetic ecosystem using YAM (<3) as collateral.\n  * Huge utility for Yam holders not only for high APYs but to be used for Yam holders to not sell their Yam but hedge it for bear market conditions.\n* Built a telegram bot ð¤for Yammers to monitor their degenerative synth collateral\n  * https://github.com/thevdm1/collateral_tracking\n* Produced trading based marketing content\n* DaoHouse ð¡ business development meetings (post Sushi) as technical support\n  * Support on complex queries relating to investment management.\n\n#### Value add to Yam Team:\n\nI would like to bring a wealth of financial expertise to Yam & its product suite. My contributions will always be focused on generating revenue for Yam.ð²This is what will help the Dao sustain itself through the brutal cyclical nature of crypto. And as such this proposal will focus on my revenue generating capabilities for Yam if I am to be signed on by the community. ð \n\n#### What I am planning to do that is revenue generating for Yam (first 3 months focus):\n\n* Further develop DaoHouse and potentially design the DaoHouse index product ð¦\n  * At a 0.7% streaming fee per $10M in such an index product could generate $70k revenue p.a for Yam. Scalable product. Some work still needs to be done before the index project gets a green light\n* Continue to optimise Degenerative synths for short term rev. generation ð°\n  * My proposed change to our synth mechanics would change GCR from 3.24 to 1.29 (using uGasJun as example) substantially increasing our treasury farming rewards -> 60% (*benefit % declines at lower synth prices). And attract higher TVL because the product can become un-liquidatable, further increasing treasury rewards.\n  * Excluding special rewards for June uGas, rewards at assumed 50% APR with our $450k ETH position, the change would have earned the treasury $12k more each month until expiry.\n  * This mechanical redesign has the same effects on any risky synthetic asset.\n* In depth treasury investment analysis, structuring and management ð¼ð\n  * Optimise treasury investment return using data driven insight for decision making. By potentially improving our treasury returns even just 2% p.a from analysis and optimisations could generate Yam an extra $140k p.a. (assuming treasury at $7M)\n  * Develop a treasury wide asset management framework\n\n#### What else I am planning to do for Yam:\n\n* Technical lead under Feddas in DaoHouse business development ð ï¸\n  * Including wider support on anything relating to DaoHouse - good to support Feddas who is split between operations and DaoHouse.\n* Monthly detailed treasury analysis and reporting\n  * More in depth forecasting, scenario analysis, look-through analysis and returns reporting/attribution.\n* Design/build out new synthetic assets to support DaoHouse clients ð¨\n  * Futures that help treasury divest governance tokens\n  * Covered calls as yield enhanced exits for concentrated token holders\n* Produce investment/trading based marketing content ð\n  * E.g. medium articles/tweet threads for Degenerative and DaoHouse.\n* Solving any problems for the dao where financial expertise is in need",

      "content": "\n\nThe last few months that I have spent working part time for YAM have been great and I would love the opportunity to expand my role within the DAO.\n\n### Biography\n\nI am an architect (buildings) who has worked on projects of many different scales on both the design and construction sides of the industry.  And while this may seem like it is not relevant to the work of building a DAO, it has a number of parallels where I believe I can add unique value (See \"why\" below). I discovered crypto in 2017 and have been active within the DeFi space for about a year. I would consider myself highly versed in the workings of the Ethereum ecosystem, and while I am not a developer, I have a broad knowledge of many projects, with a particular interest in crypto-economics.\n\n### Current Role\n\nMy current role in the DAO is a bit amorphous. As described in the initial [compensation plan](https://forum.yam.finance/t/yip-yam-contributor-manifesto-and-compensation-revised-12-1-2020/1005) my role focuses on âstrategyâ with specific roles being discord moderation, strategy discussion, and SubDAO token sales, with an expected time commitment of 10 hrs/wk.\n\nIn the time since that proposal I have done work for the DAO in a number of different areas:\n\n* [Governance analysis](https://forum.yam.finance/t/yam-governance-process-analysis-and-questions/1113) and [proposed reforms](https://forum.yam.finance/t/proposed-updated-governance-process-v0-1/1141)\n* Work on UMA synths and the YAM collateral and price identifier Umips\n* Ideation and discussion around [Degenerative economics and potential token design](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ofMqEbTzrrjc11H74GQjBz-iobMta0w1DmxT3R4j8yA/edit).\n* Contributed to numerous conversations about overall DAO strategy as well as strategy around specific sub-projects\n* Business development leads for DaoHouse\n* Moderated both discord and the forums\n* Developed a number of out-there ideas including [AYM: a Yam Built Stablecoin](https://forum.yam.finance/t/aym-a-yam-built-stablecoin-and-revenue-token/1121) as well as a long analysis of our [pre-rebase token](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10Jxtn1vP-HTkBICop1LFOt5wR3ROpX8Xc-kc58ZZdkA/edit) model that Iâm pretty sure no one read.\n\nThe time is ripe for me to part ways with my previous job working for an architecture firm and come jump into Crypto and DeFi full time. **Below, I want to lay out why I think I am a good fit to contribute in an expanded role at YAM and how I would do so.**\n\n### Why?\n\nAs many have mentioned before, YAM is a great story of rags, riches, and a phoenix risen from the ashes. It is a community of diverse contributors and smart cookies. What we are building is hard to nail down. YAM isnât one thing, but a loose collection of ideas and projects that are all housed under one umbrella. This is what I love about it. It is not limited by some mandate or assumption of what it should be, but by what we choose to make it.\n\nBuilding YAM is a bit like designing and building a house. There are lots of different pieces that all have their own requirements but in the end need to work together to make a cohesive and well functioning whole. This is often called composability, and it is what I love about architecture and it is also what I love about YAM, and Defi in general. There are many different elements that all need to be understood so that they can then be fit together to become more than a sum of their parts. **I want to help YAM become more than the sum of its parts.**\n\n### How?\n\nSo how can we do that? I realize that the aspirational stuff I wrote above only works if we can get the individual components working well. That is where I will start.\n\n* Degenerative.finance: I would like to take a larger role and help steward our new synths forward. I do not have the financial chops of some of the gurus around like Jono (TheVDM1) and Theo but I have a good sense of how UMA works and would be interested in diving in more. I can help coordinate turning the financial ideas that we have into working synths and assist with the marketing and messaging of them.\n\n* Umbrella: As we gear up to launch Umbrella there seem to be a number of outstanding questions regarding how we want to position it in the market as well as optimize it for the target audience we choose. I would like to take on the challenge of diving into the protocol and working with the developers to better understand the inner workings of it and help to determine how we can make it a successful product. This will require working alongside Theo and Bruce to create a product that is beautiful and functional.\n\n* Yam Factory: This would take lower priority compared to the above 2 roles. The Yam Factory is still just an idea. It needs to be fleshed out with ideation and documentation about what it is and how it may function. If we are going to fund and incubate projects, we need to first be able to communicate to potential builders how we can do that. I would like to work on a framework and documentation around the YAM factory that lays out an MVP for it. Some work on this has been done and it will need to be dug up and considered based on what we have learned recently with Degenerative and Umbrella.\n\n* Overall Strategy: As a small and flexible organization, it helps to be able to wear many hats. And while I may focus a majority of my time on Degenerative and Umbrella, it is still important to keep the whole picture in mind. As I mentioned above, I want to help YAM become more than the sum of its parts.\n  * In that spirit, I plan to stay abreast of everything that is happening in the DAO and look for ways that we can create synergies within our products but also with other protocols.\n  * I will use the connections that I have within the space to search for new opportunities for YAM.\n  * Continue to think hard about YAM and SubDAO tokenomics.\n  * Research new projects and opportunities, including layer 2 solutions for our products.\n  * Jump in to help with whatever is needed when deadlines loom, and hopefully use some of my design skills to help out our talented design team when needed.\n  * Continue to propose crazy ideas in the hope that one day one of them wonât be as crazy as it sounds.\n\n### Requested Compensation: Yam Streamed Over 3 Month Period\n\nMaintain existing pay of 1250 YAM BoU per month (3125 $YAM)\nAdd 30hrs/week pay at $6000/month. 1/2 in YAM based on 30 day TWAP, 1/2 in yUSD\n\n### Final Words\n\nI am committed to making interesting and beautiful things and see an opportunity to do that with YAM. I look forward to working to diligently work at making YAM a powerhouse in the DeFi space with a unique value proposition and robust and vibrant community.",

      "content": "Blokku-chan, @blokku-chan\n\nForum discussion: https://forum.yam.finance/t/draft-proposal-contributor-request-for-compensation/1379\n\nHey Yam Fam! I'm applying for compensation on the work I'm doing for Degenerative V2.\n\n\n### My Role and Responsibilities\n- UX designer\n- Frontend developer\n- 3D Illustrator\n\n\n### Requested Compensation:\n$4,800 worth of TWAP Yam Streamed Over 3 Month Period\n\n\n### Biography + Skills and Experience:\nIâm the Lead of Product at a seed-stage startup. I have over 7 years of experience designing and building products. I operate in the intersection of customer success, product marketing, technical architecture, and business intelligence; all of which are needed to build incredible products. Iâve led my team from a third-world country to a global scale with international partners and backers. My skills involve full stack development, product design, and marketing. These have helped me build, launch, and scale lots of fun products in the past, for myself (as side projects) and my team. I joined crypto at the peak of the last bull-run (bought the BTC top :sob:) and since have gone down the rabbit hole, all the way to #DeFi.\n\n\n### Value add to Yam Team:\nYam operates like a decentralised version of the product studio I run. Iâve learned a lot of painful lessons from my experiences there and will be using that to help the team setup a more robust and efficient product development process. I will be sharing templates and resources we have developed in hopes of that. I also think I can greatly support Yam and itâs suite of products with awesome UX design, branding and marketing graphics.\n\n\n### What Iâve done for Yam:\nSo far, Iâve consulted on Yam on a design-to-development handoff workflow that will greatly increase our development speed (fewer âwen launch?â questions anyone?), some of which we will be trialling for Degenerative finance. Iâve also been working with Bruce on a top-secret project to reward the Yam community. Hint? It rhymes with delectables. Iâve also been working on the information architecture and wireframes for the Degenerative v2 dapp, super excited about this!\n\n**Hereâs a link to see ongoing work on Degenerative V2:**\nhttps://www.figma.com/file/M5oDCRCKgEJwe3lCdgeuDk/Degenerative-Wireframe?node-id=109%3A3969\n\n\n\n### What I am planning to do for Yam:\nIâll be designing and developing the frontend for Degenerative v2 and handoff to Indigo for implementation. Then Iâll create 3D illustrations for the website as well. \n\nLooking forward to working with the Yammy Gang on this!",

      "content": "# Title: Treasury providing liquidity for uSTONKs and additional $YAM rewards for uSTONKs and uGAS\nAuthor: @feddas\nForum discussions: https://forum.yam.finance/t/yip-treasury-providing-liquidity-for-ustonks-and-additional-yam-rewards-for-ustonks-and-ugas/1378\n\n\n# Basic Summary\nDegnerative.Finance is about to list uSTONKs synthetic that tracks an index consisting of ten stocks that are most commented on r/wallstreetbets. uGAS-JUN21 is going to switch to a quarterly expiration to increase liquidity on a single synthetic. Both synthetics will launch on March 8th. \nThis proposal \n\n* yUSD in the treasury (~$910,000) to mint uSTONKs synthetics tokens on degenerative.finance. Then provide liquidity in order to mine UMA tokens. \n* Provide an additional total of 50,000 $YAM tokens as rewards over 3 weeks after March 8th for Minters and LPers of uSTONKS and uGAS-JUN21 to promote an active and strong market. \n  * This will be a trial run for future liquidity mining rewards for synthetics on Degenerative.Finance.\n  * $Yam rewards will be provided from the incentive mining pool that has been already setup for farming incentives. No additional YAMs will be minted beyond what has been allocated for the incentive pool. \n\n# Abstract\n\nYam will offer additional 5000 $Yam Tokens first week and 10,000 $Yam next two weeks for Minting + LPing uSTONKS. Same rewards will also apply to uGAS-JUN21. \nWe will be using around $900k of the treasury to Mint and LP uSTONKS. Initially it will be high CR ~4.\n\nUsing the yUSD in the treasury for degenerative.finance has several benefits: \n* Minting uSTONKs and providing liquidity will support the ecosystem for degenerative.finance. The higher the liquidity the more the potential volume and usage for uSTONKs. \n* By providing liquidity, the treasury will receive UMA rewards. \n* Minting uSTONKs requires stablecoin USDC as collateral and LPing uSTONKs requires USDC to pair. Ultimately there is no price risk, only impermanent loss risk and liquidation risk. \n\n# Specifications\nThe plan for the uSTONKs mint+lp treasury proposal: \n1. $910k yUSD in treasury will be unwrapped into USDC. \n2. Deposit $600k USDC to mint $150k of uSTONKs at a CR of 4.\n3. Pair uSTONKs with $150k of USDC and deposit on AMM \n4. Deposit remaining $150k USDC into our general expense multisig to add collateral to our minted position in case it gets low because the price of uSTONKs goes up too much. \n5. Purchase additional $10k uSTONKs to cover any possible IL\n6. If CR hits 2 we will add $150k USDC from general expense multisig in order to protect position.  \n\nThe plan for additional $Yam rewards distribution. \n1. Rewards will start on March 8th as soon as contracts are available and up on Degenerative.Finance\n2. Additional UMA Rewards and YAM rewards will be airdropped for minting and LPing either uSTONKS or uGASJUN21\n3. UMA and YAM rewards will be distributed on the regular monthly rewards distribution which will be April 7th + 3 days on-chain proposal. \n",

      "content": "### Title: **yamHOUSE purchase of Coinshares Gold and Cryptoassets Index CGI**\n### Author: @Feddas\n### Links to additional documentation for CGI: \nhttps://coinshares.com/products-services/index-strategies\nhttps://coinshares.com/assets/index-strategies/CGCI-Methodology.pdf\nhttps://gov.indexcoop.com/t/iip-7-coinshares-gold-and-cryptoassets-index-lite-version-cgci-lv/242\n\n\n## Basic Summary\n#### yamHOUSE purchase of Coinshares Gold and Cryptoassets Index CGI\n\nyamHOUSE has been funded with yUSD and Krugman is running analysis on potentially the initial purchases of assets for yamHOUSE. This proposal allows Krugman to purchase CGI. CGI index while it seems simple and boring, it is a very big deal. Structured products like CGI with an emphasis on Growth with reduced volatility in traditional finance receives investments in the Billions. This will be an arrow in our quiver of tools to market DAO House to other communities. \n\n## Abstract\nThe CoinShares Gold and Cryptoassets Index Lite Version (CGCI-LV) is an adaptation of the original EU Benchmark Regulated index launched by the CoinShares Group in 2020 (see here: https://coinshares.com/products-services/index-strategies 30) that only includes ERC-20 tokens in order to be compatible in a tokenized index smart contract.\n\n\nSince the original CGCI is constructed using physical gold and 5 individual cryptoassets some re-engineering of the initial structure was required, whilst ensuring that the core theory and value proposition was preserved. The CGCI-LV therefore deploys the same theory but instead limits the index to 3 ERC-20 token constituents; a gold stablecoin and 2 cryptoassets.\nFor the gold basket, wrapped-DGLD (wDGLD) was chosen as the ERC-20 gold stablecoin. For the cryptoasset basket wrapped-bitcoin (wBTC) and wrapped-Ether (wETH) were selected based on being the largest and most established cryptoassets.\n\n\nAcademic research conducted in partnership with Imperial College London found that a pairing of gold and cryptoassets in a way that accounts for their risk contribution delivers a risk-adjusted return profile that is superior to holding gold or cryptoassets alone. The CGCI-LV is designed with the aim of providing diversified exposure to the alternative asset space in a way that yields a superior risk-return profile when compared to holding such assets in isolation while being orthogonal to traditional financial markets. Accordingly, the Index must:\n\n* Be comprised of a small number of liquid, investable constituent assets\n* Exhibit a relatively stable composition of asset weights that do not vary dramatically between rebalancing periods, leading to low turnover\n* Utilise some means of principled risk control leading to lower volatility\n* Be specified in a clear and unambiguous manner to facilitate validation and reproducibility\n* Hold constituent assets on a long basis only\n* Not make use of leverage.\n\n\n## Motivation\nTwo noteworthy characteristics of the returns of non-stablecoin cryptoassets are their high volatility, which brings with it a high level of risk, and their high intraclass correlation, which limits the benefits that can be had by diversifying across multiple cryptoassets. Yet cryptoassets exhibit no correlation with gold, a highly-liquid yet scarce asset which has proved to function as a safe haven during crises affecting traditional financial systems.\n\nAlthough volatility poses challenges in terms of increased uncertainty, there are also benefits to be had from its proper management through diversification and regular rebalancing (Bouchey et al., 2012, The Journal of Wealth Management. Volatility harvesting: Why does diversifying and rebalancing create portfolio growth?). This is exemplified by the so-called Shannonâs Demon approach in which two, ideally uncorrelated, assets â at least one of which is highly volatile â are periodically rebalanced to maintain an ideal target allocation. The resulting expected growth rate is greater than the arithmetic mean of the individual expected growth rates, while the variance of the returns is less than the mean of the individual variances (Poundstone, 2005. Fortuneâs Formula.).\n\nThe CGCI-LV is intended to be a low-volatility index that utilises the concept of volatility harvesting through (a) forming a basket of cryptoassets and (b) combining it with gold using weighted-risk contribution as a rebalancing mechanism. By decreasing volatility levels, it seeks to yield superior risk-adjusted returns when compared to a number of alternative strategies, including holding cryptoassets or gold alone. Further, it presents a moderate turnover, which should translate into moderate operating costs.\n\n## Size of opportunity\nThe CGCI has already gained a lot of demand and CoinShares is currently investigating opportunities to deploy the index as an investable benchmark in its passive products business. Additionally, it is anticipated that the CGCI-LV would likely be well received by the native crypto community and is expected to be picked up by CEXs to offer it to their users.\n",

      "content": "## YIP: Add 30,000 $YAM tokens to the general expense fund and convert it to a 2 of 3 multi-sig wallet. \n\nAuthor: @Feddas\n\nForum discussions: https://forum.yam.finance/t/yip-add-30-000-yam-tokens-to-the-general-expense-fund-and-convert-it-to-a-2-of-3-multi-sig-wallet/1293\n\n\n### Basic Summary\nPreviously Yam has approved a general expense fund of $5000 yUSD from the treasury: \nhttps://forum.yam.finance/t/yip-create-a-general-expense-account-and-reimburse-hodldwon-for-v3-contract-deployment-contribution/1021\nThis proposal adds 30,000 $YAM from the contributor vesting pool and converts the fund into a 2 of 3 multi-sig for small and irregular payments that would be too onerous go through a full YAM Governance proposal and vetting process. It will still be used for small general expenses, but now also for bounties, on-boarding new contributors before voting on part or full time compensation, marketing campaign costs, etc.\n\n### Abstract\n\nThis proposal would allocate 30,000 $YAM tokens to a general expense multi-sig. In order to alleviate usage of funds from the Treasury, the community has suggested to minimize the usage of funds from the treasury for expenses, and instead use the $YAM that has already been minted in the contributor vesting pool.\nWe will create a 2 of 3 multisig to review and payout any small or irregular expenditures from the general expense fund. I nominate 3 non-U.S. based long time contributors with vested interest in making sure that funds are appropriately spent: Hodldwon, 0xE and Ronin.\n\n### Motivation\nWeâve started working with some community developers and other members and asked them for a trial period. This Yam for the general expense fund would be used to incentivize these trial periods and show a commitment from Yam to compensate contributions. While they are performing tasks (before we create a full/part time contributor compensation proposal for them) we need to have access to an operating budget without going through a full governance proposal process for small, and typically irregular payments.\nWeâve also started the uGas logo contest and it has gotten a significant amount of submissions from the community. The general expense fund would also be responsible for paying contest winners for this contest and others like it. \nThe general expense fund would be responsible for: \n- Yam infrastructure expenses\n- New Contributor trials / on-boarding\n- Development / collaborative tools \n- Gas costs\n- Small misc expenses directly related to Yam\n\nIf it is possible to pay in $YAM, then it should be the first option. \nAll expenses will be documented and a transparency report will be available monthly. \nWhen funds are low in the account, a top-up request for additional funds will be made. \n\n### Specifications\nCreate 2 of 3 Gnosis Multisig wallet and as 3 non-U.S. based contributors as signers. Suggested Contributors are Hodldwon, 0xE and Ronin. \nSend 30,000 YAM from Contributor Vesting Pool and the $5000 yUSD from Yam Treasury from the previous approval to a multisig and for each disbursement, ensure audit log records include\n1) Party paid\n2) Payment reason\n",

The specific element changes the requirements for snapshot votes\n\n#### Specifications\n\nAll YAM quantities noted below are in scaled YAM (what you see in your wallet, and not BoU)\n\nThe proposed change is to create two separate types of snapshot votes: Signalling and Final.\n\nSignalling Votes are used to determine support for a proposal and to determine parameters for governance actions. We propose that these votes require 2,500 YAM to be created. There is no quorum requirement on these votes and they can take any form (yes/no, percentage, ranked choice, etc).\n\nFinal Votes are used to ratify a proposal using snapshot. They require 10,000 YAM to be created and must be in a YES/NO format. They have a minimum quorum requirement of 500,000 YAM voting âYesâ and will pass with >50% of the votes (same as on chain votes).\n\nThis will require some work within the snapshot system to implement, which I leave to devs to comment on feasibility. I have no reason to believe it is not possible, although tweaks may occur once ratified based on feedback from developers. If there are changes to the specifications based on this feedback the proposal will be brought back to be re-ratified.\n",

      "content": "### Title: **Funding YDS Investment Portfolio with Yam Treasury**\n### Author: @Feddas\n### Forum discussions: \nhttps://forum.yam.finance/t/yip-investment-portfolio-strategy-polling-voting/927\nhttps://forum.yam.finance/t/yam-investment-portfolio-update-2/948\nhttps://forum.yam.finance/t/yam-investment-portfolio-description-and-current-road-map/906\n\n\n### Basic Summary\n#### YDS is ready for testing and full deployment, and this proposal is to determine the amount of yUSD to allocate to YDS\n\nThe investment objective of the YDS is to achieve long term capital appreciation and minimize risk in order to support growth and development of the Yam Ecosystem. \nYam Investment Portfolio will be moving to an active management system through a collaboration with Tokensets. This will allow a more dynamic allocation of assets with better risk handling and analysis without loss of decentralization. \n\n### Abstract\nThere is currently approximately $2.25mm in yUSD in the treasury. Current and predicted allocations are as follows: \nGreat Yam Wall $350k\nPredicted - Operations $500k \nPredicted - Umbrella $250k\n\n#### Remaining $1,150,000 yUSD that can be allocated to YDS. \nThe current assets that are being utilized to farm Index, Sushi, and UMA will remain outside the YDS until the proper adapters are built into Set Protocol to handle these assets. \n\n#### General consensus from the community found that a moderate 3 was appropriate for our initial strategy: \n\nA moderate strategy would target a Beta (vs. ETH) of 1.5 and a correlation of 0.8\n* In a real world terms, when ETH is heads up or down, the entire portfolio should follow at maximum of 1.5x ETHâs movement. If it goes up, the gains are magnified by up to 1.5x and vice versa.  \n* With correlation of 0.8 the assets inside the set will move in the same direction as ETH 80% of the time and would be a counter trend 20% of the time. \n* All this is in efforts to minimize systemic risk while being fairly aggressive and target higher gains. \n\nFor our initial strategy our underlying assets would be similar to this: \n* 33% ETH\n* 33% wBTC\n* 33% Yielding Stablecoin or Stablecoin\n\n\n### Motivation\n#### Treasury allocation % for Yam Dao Set\n@Designerâs Yam Brand Pillar â Yam is committed to decentralized protocol ownership. It seeks to leverage its powerful and forward-looking community to both build and guide the protocol. Community decides how best to invest treasury funds to ensure the success of the project. Governance of the protocol and management of the treasury can only be performed with approval from YAM token holders. \n\nWe as the community need to decide how we should allocate the treasury to maximize utility but allowing flexibility to access funds when needed.\n\nCurrently there are multiple Yam products that are in development and will require the use of the Treasury Funds (Yam Umbrella Protection, The Great Yam Wall). These two products will require a fixed or increasing usage of the treasury and should take priority in allocation. \n\nThe advantage of Yam Dao Set is that it works in a similar way as Defi Pulse Index. The treasury will invest in Yam Dao Set, and the set will in return mint YDS tokens for the treasury that represents the value invested into the Set. The YDS tokens are fungible and can be traded on the secondary market. This allows us to be flexible in the amount invested into the set. After we get an idea of what will be required for Yam Umbrella Protection and the Great Yam Wall protocols, we will decide the allocation for YDS.  \n\n#### Yam Dao Set Manager\nThe wealth management mantra: âMost people donât plan to fail; they just fail to plan.â \nYDS Manager will be directly in charge of investing the assets inside the set according to the overall strategy Yam governance decides. His goal will be to maximize returns and minimize risk while following the guardrails set in place by Yam governance. \n\nYDS Manager will be elected by Yam governance. YDS manager should fit the following criteria: \n* Expert knowledge of cryptocurrency assets and more specifically Ethereum based Decentralized Finance. \n* Expert knowledge of tokenset contracts and how to effectively use the system to trade and manage. \n* Expert knowledge of risk management techniques and methods. \n* Undying love for all things Yam. \n\n#### @Krugman has been elected to the position of YDS Manager. \n* He is working with Tokensets to build out the functional and technical requirements noted above. \n** He will be directly involved in building the smart contracts needed. \n* Heâs one of the first social set traders on tokensets and is #2 ranked in assets under management. \n* Trading since 2013, experience in cryptocurrency, FX, futures, options and equities. \n* Been a core contributor with Yam since the beginning. \n",

      "content": "## Title: Distribution of UMA rewards for uGas minting and Yam Treasury providing liquidity\n#### Author: @Feddas\n#### Forum discussions: https://forum.yam.finance/t/distrbution-of-uma-rewards-for-ugas-and-yam-treasury-liquidity-mining-proposal-and-liquidation-bot/1138\n \n# Basic Summary\nThe community has already approved using the treasury to provide liquidity to uGas: https://snapshot.page/#/yam.eth/proposal/QmWcns71u1c34b6sM6oJy8WoMLYcwz4b16bknTGvFFXH4x\nThere are four additional decisions that need to be ratified on how best to use UMA rewards and treasury to support uGas and future synthetics.\n\n### 1. UMA rewards availability for minting uGas and LPing vs only LPing\nYam team believes that rewards for Minting uGas and LPing will provide the highest liquidity for uGas and synths. \n\n### 2. Since uGas synths expire every month, liquidity needs to be managed to ensure trading of multiple months contracts. How should we allocate UMA rewards for specific month contracts?\nYam Team believes that a weighted split of rewards on any particular month is not necessary. All rewards will be distributed to all Mint and LPers on any uGas contract. \n\n### 3. Yam community has already voted and approved allocating ~$400k worth ETH from the treasury to support uGas by minting and LPing. Which month uGas should we allocate what portion of this liquidity to? \nYam team believes itâs best that we allocate 100% of this liquidity to the next monthâs contract and roll it over on the 7th of every month. ie. on Feb 7th we will be moving Yamâs liquidity to March uGas contract. By providing all the liquidity on one month, it allows Yam to better manage risks of liquidation. If in the future the market matures, we can consider changing this. \n\n\n### 4. Create and deploy a Yam Treasury supported uGas liquidation bot. \nYam team believes that we should deploy a liquidation bot to protect, Yamâs position but also the communityâs positions. \n \n# Abstract\nuGas is the first synthetic Degenerative.Finance is launching with and creating the right balance of incentives and liquidity is important to build out the synthetic ecosystem because uGas is only the first of many synthetics. \n\nThe UMA rewards are based on the total value of minted synthetics vs total value of minted uGas. UMA distributes 50,000 UMA per week across all synthetics. Yam will receive itâs portion based on that ratio. Yam will distribute the rewards as per our medium article 10% Yam Treasury 40% dApp mining (degenerative.finance which is also Yam) and 50% to end users. After discussing with the UMA team there are a few things that need to be discussed and determined. A few key points that UMA explained: \n\nuGasâs primary use case is hedging / speculation. Need to add liquidity to at minimum a month in advance contract. Ie. Jan 1st, we should add liquidity to Febâs contract. Janâs gas usage is already starting to be known, so itâs ability to hedge or speculate is reduced. The more uGas that is minted, the more UMA rewards Yam receives to distribute. \n \n \n# Motivation\nYamâs goal is to create as large as possible uGas market by increasing minting and LP. We can do this by controlling the distribution of UMA rewards across uGas contracts. There are two variables that Yam should determine: \nDo we reward mint + LP or just LP\nYam team recommends we mint + LP for now then we re-evaluate. \nCons - Rewards based on total invested are approximately half due to the increased collateral requirement.\nPros - Mint + LP creates a neutral position in uGas, so thereâs no uGas price risk but there is impermanent loss risk and liquidation risk. Encourages more minted uGas thus creating a healthier market.\nBeginning, ending and weighting of UMA rewards for specific monthly contracts. \nYam team recommends we weigh rewards 75%/25% for the next two months uGas contracts and roll those rewards forward on the 7th of every month. \nie. Today is Jan 7th, rewards are moved to 75% Feb and 25% March until Feb 7th. \nBased on recommendations from UMA it is better to add liquidity to next monthâs contract. \nHow much of the treasury should we invest into each uGas contract to provide liquidity? Previously, we approved providing 50/50 liquidity to the future two months but because of liquidation concerns we need to re-evaluate. \nYam team recommends that the treasury deploys 100% of liquidity on Feb contract and rolls the liquidity March contract on Feb 7th + 2.5 days governance. \nThere is a risk of liquidation if uGas prices rise and or ETH prices fall. Since it requires 2.5 days to pass an emergency provision, risk of liquidation is possible. UMA noted that anyone can deposit additional collateral to our position at any time to reduce the risk of liquidation. If added, it can only be removed by owner of contract (Yam), so there needs to be a defined reimbursement process and or incentive program. \nLiquidation bots are necessary for security of the contract. Brock is currently funding and running a bot. This function should be transferred to the Yam and its treasury. \n \n \n# Risks\nThere is a chance of liquidation which we will mitigate by monitoring the position and creating a discord bot to alert everyone if there is a position that is close to liquidation. \nA primer on how liquidations, collateral ratios and pricing of uGas token. \nThere are two collateralization ratios (CR): \nGlobal CR - This is the average collateralization ratio across all token sponsors of a synthetic token. When minting uGas, you must stay above this CR. \nMinimum CR â This is the ratio that if you drop below, your collateral could be liquidated to cover your minted assets. For uGas tokens this ratio is set at 1.25. \nTo mint uGas tokens, you deposit ETH as collateral and it allows you to mint tokens up to the Global CR. For example if you deposit $10,000 worth of ETH and the GCR is 4, that means you can mint up to $10,000/4 = $2,500 worth of uGas tokens. In this example, if you minted 10 uGas tokens, if you return 10 uGas tokens, it will unlock all of your collateral no matter the price of the token at the time of return. \nPricing of uGas tokens is derived from the 2hr Time Weighted Average Price (TWAP) of the highest liquidity AMM pool. TWAP makes it resistant against flash attacks as they only effect a single or a few blocks, then natural arbitrage should return the price back to normal. \nWhatâs the risk of liquidation? If we mint with a ratio of 3.5 and the minimum CR is 1.25. uGas 2-hour TWAP would have to increase by 156% or ETH decrease by 64% to be close to minimum CR, both of which are unlikely.\n\n",

      "content": "Multisig Guardian\n\nhttps://forum.yam.finance/t/yip-multisig-guardian/1123/5\n\nBasic Summary\n\nThe Guardian role in the Compound governance module allows for the veto-ing of proposals. This is a helpful mechanism to provide an additional layer of security for the protocol to prevent governance takeovers. While this threat was greatest in the early days of the protocol when delegation was low and a vote AGAINST a malicious proposal might not have been feasible, it is still a valuable security measure to have.\n\nAs such, I propose to transition the Guardian role to a 3/5 Multisig.\n\nMotivation\n\nCurrently the Guardian is set to the YAM Deployer address, controlled by Brock. He has never had to use the Guardian, and in many ways its very existence acts as a deterrent, but it is an unnecessary single point of failure for the protocol and adds unnecessary risk to his person and the protocol.\n\nSpecifications\n\nCreate a multisig with the following signers, create new Governor with multisig as governor, update admin of Timelock to new Governor:\n\nFeddas (Full-time Ops) - 0xbdac5657eDd13F47C3DD924eAa36Cf1Ec49672cc\n\nNate (Full-time Smart Contract) - 0xEC3281124d4c2FCA8A88e3076C1E7749CfEcb7F2\n\nHodlDwon (Former Rescue Multisig Signer + Advisor/Strategist) - 0x46499275b5c4d67dfa46b92d89aada3158ea392e\n\n0xE (Full-time Full Stack Dev) - 0x8A8acf1cEcC4ed6Fe9c408449164CE2034AdC03f\n\nRonin (Chinese/English Translator + Moderator) - 0xf5f1287F7B71381fFB5Caf3b61fA0375112531BC",

      "title": "YIP-36: Use ETH in Treasury to mint and farm uGasFeb + uGasMar on Degenerative.Finance",
      "content": "**Degenerative.Finance + UMA farming of uGasFeb, uGasMar**\n\n**Basic Summary**\n\nYam is about to launch Degenerative.Finance dApp based on the UMA platform, our first few synthetics are going to be uGas tokens. For more information visit our discord chat and links below.\n\nThis proposal would use the up to the currently non-utilized ETH in the treasury (~$220,000) to mint uGasFeb / uGasMar tokens on degenerative.finance. Then provide liquidity in order to mine UMA tokens via their developer mining program: https://medium.com/uma-project/uma-announces-developer-mining-6f6fe15d5604\n\n**Abstract**\n\nDegenerative.finance beta will launch on Dec 21st and part of the treasuryâs goal is to support the Yam ecosystem which degenerative.finance is a part of. Assets in the treasury should be utilized to gain yield with risk according to our investment strategy. Using the ETH in the treasury for degenerative.finance has two benefits:\n\n1. Minting uGas tokens and providing liquidity will support the ecosystem for degenerative.finance. The higher the liquidity the more the potential volume and usage for uGas.\n2. By providing liquidity, the treasury will receive UMA rewards.\n\n**Motivation**\n\nDegenerative.financeâs uGas token is the first of a series of synthetics that Degenerative plans on rolling out to the public. Iâve included a guide on what uGas is below. Adding liquidity to the uGas tokens is important to support the infrastructure and it also gets UMA rewards.\n\nWhat is uGAS?\n\n* uGAS is a Synthetic Gas Futures Token.\n* Each uGAS token is named after the month that itâll expire at the end of (for example, the uGAS-JAN21 token will expire at 0:00 UTC, Feb 1st 2021.)\n* Once the uGAS token expires, it will settle at the median gas price of all Ethereum transactions for the past 30 days.\n* Each uGAS token represents 1,000,000 GAS, so if the median gas price over the 30 days before expiry was 70 Gwei, the uGAS token would be worth 0.07 ETH.\n\nWait, whatâs a Synthetic?\n\n* Synthetic tokens are collateral-backed tokens whose value changes depending on the tokensâ reference index.\n* In the example above, our uGASâs reference index is the 30 day median gas price.\n* Synthetics are created by depositing collateral into a smart contract and minting tokens backed by that collateral.\n\nIf you have any questions about Synthetics, feel free to drop by Yamâs discord.\n\nAdditional resources:\n\nhttps://medium.com/yam-finance/degenerative-finance-ugas-explained-458bedbc2f17\n\nhttps://medium.com/yam-finance/yam-x-uma-degenerative-finance-922bd2d5bab6\n\nhttps://medium.com/uma-project/uma-announces-developer-mining-6f6fe15d5604\n\n**Risks**\n\nThere is a chance of liquidation which we will mitigate by only minting enough tokens to have a collateral ratio of 3.5 or Global Collateral Ratio, whichever is higher.\n\nA primer on how liquidations, collateral ratios and pricing of uGas token.\n\nThere are two collateralization ratios (CR):\n\n1. Global CR - This is the average collateralization ratio across all token sponsors of a synthetic token. When minting uGas, you must stay above this CR.\n2. Minimum CR â This is the ratio that if you drop below, your collateral could be liquidated to cover your minted assets. For uGas tokens this ratio is set at 1.25.\n\nTo mint uGas tokens, you deposit ETH as collateral and it allows you to mint tokens up to the Global CR. For example if you deposit $10,000 worth of ETH and the GCR is 4, that means you can mint up to $10,000/4 = $2,500 worth of uGas tokens. In this example, if you minted 10 uGas tokens, if you return 10 uGas tokens, it will unlock all of your collateral no matter the price of the token at the time of return.\n\nPricing of uGas tokens is derived from the 2hr Time Weighted Average Price (TWAP) of the highest liquidity AMM pool. TWAP makes it resistant against flash attacks as they only effect a single or a few blocks, then natural arbitrage should return the price back to normal.\n\nWhatâs the risk of liquidation? If we mint with a ratio of 3.5 and the minimum CR is 1.25. uGas 2-hour TWAP would have to increase by 156% or ETH decrease by 64% to be close to minimum CR, both of which are unlikely.\n\n**Specifications**\n\nTo implement this proposal:\n\n1. Create smart contract to use ETH currently in the treasury to deposit as collateral. Allocation as follows:\n\n*  ETH split 50/50 for uGasFeb adn uGasMar.\n*  Take 75% of the ETH to use a collateral and 25% to pair with uGas token to LP\n\n2. Mint uGas tokens.\n3. Deposit uGas and ETH as a liquidity provider on Uniswap to mine UMA.\n",

As we move forward and learn from past choices, some fascinating dichotomies of programmable money and the people that govern them arise; the features of Yam are incompatible.\n\n=== Motivation ===\n\nYam seeks price stability by changing the supply of Yams in your wallet without trying to adjust the value in your wallet, but that hasnât worked very well. The price moves in the direction of the peg, but the problem comes when the community, who govern the protocol, seek price appreciation and not stability.\n\nToken holders want appreciation of Yam:\n\nHow do these two things all fit together? Well, they donâtâ¦\n\nThere needs to be a positive feedback loop between community governance, the YAM governance token, and value creation by Yam Treasury investments, and by all accounts the rebasing mechanism is holding us back.\n\nWe are currently developing multiple products in tandem including Umbrella, UMA-Degenerative, and YAM DAO Set (YDS). All of which have some component of revenue generation. We are also installing the machinery for our Yam Factory to hopefully create even more products. I would like the Yam community to focus on what we are building and not the rebasing function.\n\nHere are the Pros of a rebasing asset:\n\nIt can be gamified (largely due to artificial price movements and supply changes)\nItâs an interesting experiment that could lead to unique use cases that non-rebasing assets cannot do.\nStable-ish (in theory)\n\nHere are the Cons of a rebasing asset:\nMore complicated to understand and calculate profit/loss than a non-rebasing asset.\nComposability between other protocols like AMMs need to be whitelisted otherwise YAMs staked as a liquidity provider could be lost.\nAny centralized exchange needs to constantly update account balances according to the changes in supply.\nStable-ish\nhigh gas fees for calling the rebase function an syncing whitelisted pools for the balance updates (high $100âs to low $1,000âs per month just in gas fees)\n\nComposability is important for long term sustainability. We are already finding new collaborations with other DeFi protocols and we donât plan on stopping there. Potentially some of these collaborations will be hindered by a rebasing asset.\n\n== Specifications ==\n\nDeveloper light to implement. The scaling factor would be fixed at a specified time and the rebase function deactivated by calling this function:\n\nyam._setRebaser(0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000)\n\nMaking it so no address can execute rebase",

      "content": "Hi Yam Fam, I am applying as Fulltime Organizations Operations.\n\n## Role and Responsibilities\nOrganizational Ops, you make sure Yam has shared goals, ethos and people are doing their best work and donât lack in funding, tooling and infrastructure. You do that by surfacing implied goals and ethos in explicit form, helping distribute budget, oversight on overall direction and keeping up the slack where the org is lacking. \n- Distribute budget with the goal of decentralizing processes for further development, security, and governance of Yam Finance. \n- Facilitate and incentivize the creation of exceptional community proposals. \n- Work with the community to determine values and mission, and plan for short and long-term goals.\n- Engage, vet, and recruit exceptional services, vendors, and community members that wish to contribute to the Yam Finance ecosystem. \n- Track community suggestions, facilitate synthesis, and guide proposals to YIPs. \n- Identify and address problems and opportunities for the protocol.\n- Build alliances and partnerships with other organizations.\n- Contributor organization of responsibilities of all contributors. Monitoring tracking and reporting. \n- Treasury - Portfolio Monitoring, budgeting and reporting â Budget income and expense in order to create a growing Treasury. \n- Partnership development â Coordinate with other DeFi ecosystems to find Win-Win partnerships. \n\n## Requested Comp\nPer month $6,000 in stablecoin and 30,000 BoU YAM vested continuously over 1 year (2,500 BoU/month). \n\n## Biography, Skills and Experience\n\nBS in Systems Engineering with minor in Finance.\n\nWorked in Wealth Management for ~10 years. Received my securities license. Expert knowledge in risk management, mutual funds, insurance, mortgages and sales. \n\nAfter wealth management, I built and ran restaurants. Two restaurants were built from ground up, including design, construction, hiring, marketing, guest relations, accounting and all internet systems. One is a quick service restaurant 4-stars on yelp and opening a second location in 2021. I am the primary shareholder and my partner runs the operations. The other one is a full-service restaurant 4.7 stars on opentable.com. Expert knowledge in operations management from top down. Managed a team of 60 employees. \n\nMy alternative life has been in crypto since 2015. Crypto is my passion. I believe in the future of it, I eat sleep dream crypto. Created multiple crypto related products and services, from a hedge fund to physical secure crypto gift cards. Been searching for an opportunity to join a project/team like Yam. This is where my passion lies.\n\n## Value add to Yam Team\nExperience in finance, business and crypto puts me in a unique position to be operations role to create an organized framework and to fully utilize resources to achieve Yamâs mission. My goal is to create enough infrastructure so that Yam as a Decentralized Autonomous Organization can become an Autonomous that can achieve its mission. \n\n## What Iâve done for Yam\nI started with Yam since V1, assisted in the voting to save yam but didnât start contributing until V3. With my wealth management background I saw the proposal to buy $250k DPI without any thoughts to overall treasury management. To me as a token holder at that time, I was worried that without an overall portfolio plan with risk management, the treasury would be in trouble for the long term, so I volunteered. Following the guidance of the Yam team and the Yamifesto, here is a list of things that Iâve directly worked on and wrote about on the forum.\n1. Formalize Yam Treasury % Allocation for Yam Ecosystem Development (including developer pay) / Investment Strategy\n\ta. https://forum.yam.finance/t/formalize-yam-treasury-allocation-for-yam-ecosystem-development-including-developer-pay-vs-investment-strategy/742\n\tb. This started the discussion of portfolio management and a better way to manage the treasury. \n2. Formalize a treasury investing strategy and allocation.\n\ta. https://forum.yam.finance/t/formalize-a-treasury-investing-strategy-and-allocation/703\n\tb. Led to this discussion of investment strategy for the investment side of the treasury. \n3. YIP Proposal: Treasury investment strategy and allocation â Updated.\n\ta. https://forum.yam.finance/t/yip-proposal-treasury-investment-strategy-and-allocation-updated/831\n\tb. Listen respond and improve idea but continually push forward. \n\tc. I think this is when I was invited to be a âstrategistâ, before this point I was only a community member trying to help out. \n4. YIP Proposal: Treasury investment strategy and allocation - Updated 10/16.\n\ta. https://forum.yam.finance/t/yip-proposal-treasury-investment-strategy-and-allocation-updated-10-16/853\n\tb. Listening and learning what limitations and how to go about working inside the Yam ecosystem. It is easy for you or I to buy a cryptocurrency and stake/farm but doing it using a DAO with on-chain governance voting is significantly different. \n5. YIP Proposal: Treasury Investment Strategy - DPI / ETH Indexcoop Farming.\n\ta. https://forum.yam.finance/t/yip-proposal-treasury-investment-strategy-dpi-eth-indexcoop-farming/873/2\n\tb. Applying discussions from community and investment strategy from above proposals, I push forward the idea of farming Index.\n6. YAM Investment Portfolio - Description and Current Road Map.\n\ta. https://forum.yam.finance/t/yam-investment-portfolio-description-and-current-road-map/906\n\tb. A conversation on between me and another member on discord sparked the idea of a collaboration between Tokensets and Yam which eventually turned into YDS â Yam Dao Set. \n\tc. Fortunately one of our strategists is @Krugman which is #2 in Assets Under Management on Tokensets currently. Krugman was able to formalize this relationship. \n\td. I continued to update the community on current progress via discord chats and forum posts. \n7. YAM Investment Portfolio Update #1 â Voting for Investment Strategy.\na. https://forum.yam.finance/t/yip-investment-portfolio-strategy-polling-voting/927\n\tb. Krugman is an expert at technical analysis for risk management. He designed a system to manage the risk of the portfolio in YDS â Yam Dao Set. \n\tc. Proposal helps the community decide on the level or risk / return that we want for the investment arm. \n8. YIP: Create a Contributor Manager Position.\n\ta. https://forum.yam.finance/t/yip-create-a-contributor-manager-position/947\n\tb. As I was going through the process of YDS I noticed a few things that needed more structure in Yam. \n\t\ti. We had super talented contributors that have stuck around and volunteer their time because they believed in Yam. When they could they help tremendously but ultimately their time was tied up in things that they needed to do to create income. \n\t\tii. There was no structure to coordinate the efforts of contributors. Without coordination of efforts, a lot of value is wasted. \n\t\tiii. I proposed that Trent take up the efforts and be a manager of current and future contributors. \n\t\tiv. In addition, someone needs to manage a budget for paying contributors. Volunteers can only last so long without pay.\n9. YAM Investment Portfolio Update #2.\n\ta. https://forum.yam.finance/t/yam-investment-portfolio-update-2/948/1\n\tb. Update to YDS as we communicate with the set team and find out how to collaborate so it is mutually beneficial. \n\tc. I nominate Krugman to manage the set because of his past experiences. I believe he will make us money. \n\td. We also start plans to offer this as a product to other organizations. We are building a unique product that will be very beneficial for other DAOs. Once we get YDS setup, it will be very easy to market this product/service and generate revenues for Yam treasury. \n10. Modelling of Size and Effectiveness of The Great Yam Wall.\n\ta. https://forum.yam.finance/t/yip-size-and-effectiveness-of-the-great-yam-wall/959\n\tb. Ragequit was one of the reasons why I invested into Yam but because of a few issues it was side tracked. \n\tc. TotV3 and I designed the new ragequit protocol that will use the treasury to directly support the price of Yams if it goes down too much. \n\td. This post models the potential value that can be achieved out of a small portion of the treasury. \n\te. If we are to use treasury funds we should be aware of the potential impact of those funds. \n\nTL/DR:\nIâve directly worked on a number of proposals to build the Yam ecosystem. Every proposal was unprompted, I noticed a need and started the proposals then adjusted as I learned, discussed and understood. My efforts directly with purchasing ETH and Farming Index (DPI was not my initiative) have already generated $10ks+ in revenue. YDS I know will generate even more revenue for Yam. Ragequit was a community initiative but never finished, and I intend to finish it. \n\nAside from proposals, everything that I do I create a framework and discuss with the team. Iâve opened the lines of communication to the Chinese community. These frameworks are a critical component in creating an autonomous organization. âGive a person a fish and it will feed him for one day, teach a person how to fish and it will feed him forever,â this is my motto in building Yam. In order for Yam to be autonomous there needs to be clear guidance for every step of the organization. Creating a framework in the beginning of the organization before it grows to big is key to growth and sustainability. Iâve learned this lesson multiple times owning and running my own organizations.  \n\n## What I am planning to do for Yam\nOrganizing, creating, monitoring operations to ensure directed focus on accomplishing milestones that advance our Yamifesto. Building the framework and laying the foundation to create a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO). I will build long term sustainable growth of Yam and ecosystem so that anyone can operate.",

They were never promised compensation but they volunteered for several month because they believed in Yamâs mission: \n \nYam is a community run Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) innovating at the intersection of decentralized governance and programmable finance, bound by shared financial incentives with the goal of empowering people with greater economic benefits and financial well being within the emerging world of Decentralized Finance (DeFi).\n \nAs we progress through the building of Yamâs ecosystem, time requirements and dedication is necessary to build out the current and future products. \n \n### Here are the guidelines for part-time contributors to receive compensation: \nâ¢\tEach contributor has their roles and responsibilities. \nâ¢\tPart-time commitment is ~10hrs of documentable work a week. \nâ¢\tMonthly contributor reports. \nâ¢\tQuarterly reviews. \nâ¢\tWeekly discussions and or calls\nâ¢\tContributors will control their own time, if there are any issues with the weekly requirements, they are flexible. \n \n### Contributor Core Values\nâ¢\tOpen and Merit Based Discussion: Contributors should organize information to be presented to the community in an open and unbiased manner. The discussion and consideration of ideas should be based on the merits of those ideas. If you disagree with an idea or solution, describe why and how you would remedy it. \nâ¢\tSupport Ethical Growth: Contributors should be committed to growing the the long term value of the YAM DAO and the YAM token and to strengthening the community of token holders and contributors.\n \n### Compensation:\n![foo](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard11/uploads/yam1/original/1X/4c38a97a70d0156353d4d43dab1fea2509b7f3e3.png)\n \n### A short intro/bio from each of the part-time contributors:\n \nKW710 | Kristopher is the founder and owner of a commercial production and animation studio based in Los Angeles with clients ranging from startups to Fortune 500 brands.   He has worked in the Film and Television industry for 10+ years and straddles the line between the creative and business side of the entertainment and advertising industries.   His latest entertainment project is a feature documentary distributed in North America by Gravitas Ventures and in the UK by Alarm Pictures.  Kristopher is fascinated by what can happen when you cross-pollinate ideas and business models between different industries and product verticals.   What is one industry's old idea has the potential to become another industry's brilliant new innovation.   What he loves about crypto is the sandbox environment it provides for innovators and entrepreneurs to experiment with different business models and revenue structures.\n \nJim | designer is the founder/owner of a Seattle based agency with over 30+ years of branding, marketing and design experience. His firm was an early adopter of digital technologies and online design. Starting in the early 90âs as a Platinum Provider to Microsoft Jim helping design Microsoft's first internet service â a project called the MSN web platform. Other agency experience includes brand strategy and full service marketing for clients such as Microsoft, IBM, Eddie Bauer, and many others. For the past 10 years the agency has been a key partner for DHL â the global shipping company â running an extensive online customer life-cycle management program for their U.S. division. Jim received his BFA in Graphic Design from the world renown Art Center College of Design in Pasadena CA.\n \nRoss has been interested in the Ethereum ecosystem since 2017, but really fell down the rabbithole in 2018. Since then I have become a DeFi junky and find myself pondering different crypto-economic systems whenever I have spare time. I was involved in early governance conversations during the launch of YFI and have helped vet and brainstorm ideas for another upcoming defi product that will be released soon. In my day job I am an architect, where I have overseen the design and construction of numerous complex and high end projects. I started farming YAM on day 1, have my delegator POAP, and see boundless potential in what we are all building here.\n \nRonin Chow is a photographer and crypto enthusiast, holding a BE in Computer Science, and good at collecting and organising information. He has been following, researching and occasionally writing Chinese articles relevant to crypto since 2014. Delivering and promoting high-quality contents into the Chinese community is his objective.\n \nMona has been engaged in marketing work, has more than ten years of team marketing experience, previously worked in Alibaba's B2B department. Good at marketing planning, core team formation, community building.\n \n**MVC - Most Valued Contributors** - Contributors that arenât included in current compensation, but are highly valued and are part of the team. \n \nHodlDwon\nHuntingisland\nMick | GenesisBlock.com\nzashton.eth\nTeresa\nJeremy\n \n# Voting: \n1.\tApprove Part Time Contributor Compensation\n2.\tDo not approve\n",

He has spent the last decade as a retail trader and has experience with Forex, futures, options, options on futures, equities and crypto.  He entered the crypto space in 2019 and joined TokenSets as a premiere trader.  He quickly rose to the top of the leaderboards in total buyers, AUM and performance.  He regularly participates in governance across multiple DeFi protocols.\nâ¢\tWorking with TokenSets to build out the functional and technical requirements noted above.\nâ¢\tHe will be directly involved in building the smart contracts needed.\nâ¢\tWas a launch-day social trader on tokensets and is ranked #2 by total AUM. \nâ¢\tTrading since 2013 with experience in cryptocurrency, FX, futures, options and equities. \nâ¢\tBeen a core contributor with Yam since the beginning. \n\n#### A word from Aaron:  \nI am honored to be nominated and considered for the position of Yam Dao Set Portfolio manager.  Ever since entering the DeFi space in 2019 I have become very passionate about centralized finance.  That journey began with me registering as a social trader on TokenSets in early 2020 and developing some of the largest AUM and highest yielding social sets to date.  This journey has culminated in me becoming a major advocate of DeFi where I often write detailed technical write-ups of various DeFi topics and have even been inspired to start a YouTube channel where I plan on creating a hub of video tutorials to help onboard the next generation of decentralized finance users.\n\nWhile I have felt drawn to many things (teaching, writing articles, videos, etc.) my strongest passions have always been with software development and financial markets.  That fact is clear over my decade plus experience as both a full stack software developer as well as a trader and student of global markets.  This position as the Yam Dao Set Portfolio Manager gives me an opportunity to use those passions and skills to help further the goals of the Yam dao and wider Yam community.  I believe that the future of Yam is very bright and this community has much to look forward to in the years ahead.\n\nThank you for considering me for this position and the responsibilities and duties it entails.\n\n#### What Iâve done for Yam:\n[YAM Investment PortfolioDescription and Current Road Map](https://forum.yam.finance/t/yam-investment-portfolio-description-and-current-road-map/906)\n\n[YDS Purchase of $125k additional ETH and $250k wBTC and Tail Risk Management](https://forum.yam.finance/t/yip-yds-purchase-of-125k-additional-eth-and-250k-wbtc-and-tail-risk-management/1002/4)\n\n# Voting: \n1.\tElect Krugman as YDS Portfolio Manager\n2.\tDo not approve\nQuorum requirements: 200,000 BoU Yams\n",

Since the Beta underlying target is ETH, this creates a fairly aggressive portfolio, which will contain a good amount of volatility. This is balanced by the fact that we only invest a minority portion of the entire treasury into YDS.\n\n# Specifications\nUse the same OTC contracts that were developed by Brock or let YDS Portfolio Manager make the purchase when YDS is ready. \n\n# Voting: \nQuorum requirements: 200,000 BoU Yams\n",

      "content": "#### Title: YIP-25: Great Yam Wall Initial funding and deployment\n\n#### Author: @Feddas\n#### Forum discussions: \n[YIP: Size and Effectiveness of The Great Yam Wall]( https://forum.yam.finance/t/yip-size-and-effectiveness-of-the-great-yam-wall/959)\n[Specification for a Simple Ragequit-like Function](https://forum.yam.finance/t/specification-for-a-simple-ragequit-like-function/938)\n[YIP: Add RageQuit Functionality](https://forum.yam.finance/t/yip-add-ragequit-functionality/588)\n\n# Basic Summary\nA core value proposition for YAM has always been the unique value of our growing treasury model. A ragequit function has been a goal of the community as a way to create a price floor. Full implementation of ragequit will not work as it was originally envisioned primarily because capital inside the treasury will be utilized to grow and develop the Yam ecosystem. This proposal is an alternative to initial ragequit designs called the Great Yam Wall. \n\nThe Great Yam Wall will be deployed to buy Yams to keep the Market Cap value above the value of the Yam Treasury. This will effectively create a price floor for Yam as originally intended by âRagequitâ. This will directly defend the price of Yam as it is falling and will bring up the price as the Yam Treasury grows.\n\n# Abstract\nA function will be created that is callable by anyone. When called, the function calculates the necessary size to bring Yam Market Cap back above the value of the Yam Treasury and makes a purchase on the highest liquidity AMM. \n\nThis proposal will vote on what % of the entire Yam Treasury we should reserve for this function. Allocation will be in yUSD â a yielding stablecoin. \n\n# Specifications\nUpon passing of this proposal, n% of the value of the treasury will be allocated for use in the function. This function will be coded and audited before deployment. Expect this process to start after significant development of current products (Umbrella, UMA, YDS, then we will get to GYW)\n\nWhen the GYW function is called:\n1.\tIf Yam Market Cap > Yam Treasury Value there is no action\n2.\tIf Yam Market Cap < Yam Treasury Value the necessary purchase as calculated by the function will be executed on the highest liquidity YAM pair.\n3.\tYAM procured by this function will be used in the most productive way possible determined by the community via governance. This might be burning, selling, using for incentives, providing liquidity, lending, etc.\n4.\tThe value of funds allocated to this function will be re-evaluated on a quarterly basis. \n\n# Analysis of different sizes of GYW\n#### There are three scenarios where the Great Yam Wall will be used.\n1. There is a massive sale of Yams due to a black swan event.\no\tWhat is the lowest Market Cap Great Yam Wall recover from given a certain liquidity in AMM.\n2. There is a slow consistent sale of Yams below the Market Cap < Treasury Value\no\tHow much support can the wall provide?\n3. The Treasury Value grows above Market Cap.\no\tHow high can the treasury push the market cap up before it is exhausted?\n\n#### Scenario 1: There is a massive sale of Yams due to a black swan event.\nQuestion: What is the lowest Market Cap Great Yam Wall recover from given a certain liquidity in AMM. To find this, we need to find the max slippage given a liquidity and the amount of funds in the pool.\n![foo](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard11/uploads/yam1/original/1X/1ca1e00ca609e3843dc21a4d60fc4e6bca39aed7.png)\n\nAs a point of reference current Sushi ETH/YAM Liquidity is $2.8mm. Letâs use $3.38mm as liquidity in this example:\n \n![foo](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard11/uploads/yam1/original/1X/6de97913bd65d836059cc858acb9b12f9c8afa9c.png)\n\n#### Conclusion 1:\nGiven that AMM liquidity is $3.38mm and the pool size is 5%-20% of treasury:\nIf the Market Cap drops to highlighted amount, the Great Yam Wall will buy enough Yam to bring the Yam Market Cap up to Treasury Value, thus successfully defending against black swan event. Charts above can be used for other liquidity values.\n\n#### Scenario 2: There is a slow consistent sale of Yams below the Market Cap < Treasury Value\nQuestion: How much support can the wall provide?\nIf thereâs no large selloff and itâs a consistent sell pressure against Yamâs Market Cap, the wall can only buy as much as the funds in the pool.\nFor example, if the pool holds 5% of the treasury, it can buy up to 5% of the market cap @ Market Cap = Treasury Value. Without any buyers except for the Great Yam Wall, there needs to be enough sellers to sell 5% of all Yams. A tall order for even the greatest of sellers, especially if the price has already gone down so far.\n\n#### Conclusion 2:\nSince the Great Yam Wall function can only be used when Yam Market Cap < Yam Treasury Value, whatever x% of Treasury we assign to the Great Yam Wall pool will require sellers to sell off the same x% of entire Yam market.\n\n#### Scenario 3: The Treasury Value grows above Market Cap.\nQuestion: What is the max slippage that the Great Yam Wall can push Yam Market Cap up to, given an AMM liquidity?\nThis function also depends on if there are sellers or not. Worse case scenario if there is a âwall of sellersâ in front of the Great Yam Wall, then this will have the same conclusion as scenario 2.\n\nWhat happens if there are no sellers except for what is on AMM liquidity, it becomes the inverse situation of scenario 1. Letâs explore this:\n\nThe slippage table would be the same:\n ![foo](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard11/uploads/yam1/original/1X/1ca1e00ca609e3843dc21a4d60fc4e6bca39aed7.png)\n![foo](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard11/uploads/yam1/original/1X/3e4fe938f785fd7bcf9f5f2ce3987b48678be5cd.png)\n\n \n#### Conclusion 3:\nGiven that AMM liquidity is $3.38mm and the pool size is 5%-20% of treasury:\nWorse case is the same as Scenario 2.\nBest case is if there are no sellers and ONLY the Great Yam Wall is buying from the market, the final MCap would be a function of slippage given a liquidity amount and purchase amount.\n\n\n##What is the optimal solution for the size of the Great Yam Wall?\nThere are two considerations that we must make in order to determine the size:\nâ¢\tIf we earmark the funds, we do not have access to those funds to be used to develop other projects and grow the treasury value. Ultimately, the goal of Yam is to grow bigger and larger. It is best to keep the size of the wall small.\nâ¢\tThe larger the wall the larger the protection but the law of diminishing returns comes into play. If you look at the slippage table above, as the wall size gets larger, the protection does not increase as much as before.\n\n\n## TLDR: What is the best size of wall? \n## 5% to 10%\nIt is a good balance between affording plenty of protection @ $3.388mm in AMM liquidity = 25% price protection and minimizing funds being tied up.\n\n\n# Voting â Results based on weighted average of all votes: \n1.\t0% Funding to the GYW\n2.\t5% Funding to the GYW\n3.\t10% Funding to the GYW\n4.\t15% Funding to the GYW\n5.\t20% Funding to the GYW\n",

      "content": "#### Title: YIP-26: Yam Mission Statement Ratification\n#### Author: @Designer\n#### Forum discussions: \n[Yam Mission Statement Ratification](https://forum.yam.finance/t/yip-yam-mission-statement-ratification/1009)\n# Basic Summary\nThis proposal is to vote on the Yamâs Mission Statement.\n# Abstract\nThe Mission Statement is the culmination of a four-part brand definition process as documented in previous forum posts. Please review and vote on the mission statement. If you vote âNoâ, please provide a comment. Yamâs mission statement summarizes the purpose that drives the Yam DAO community. It says why Yam does what it does. When Yam considers new opportunities, it relies on the mission to make appropriate decisions.\n# Motivation\nBrands are tools that drive value: it was this premise that motivated Yam contributors to invest time developing the Yam brand. Branding is a long-term strategy that can yield measurable returns throughout the life of Yam as it grows and morphs.\n### Here are Three reasons to invest time and energy developing the Yam brand.\n#### 1. Attract Customers, Yam Members, and Ecosystem Partners\nBy clearly defining audience personas and crafting marketing messaging thatâs specifically targeted at your ideal target audiences. Significantly improve relationships with those that interact with Yamâs brand. And few things are more valuable than brand loyalty.\n#### 2. Boost Value of Organization\nNever underestimate the power of brand equity. it can have a positive effect on your YAM token price. Stronger brands realize stronger financial performance. The long-term result of branding is that the Yam DAO itself is worth more.\n#### 3. Increase Marketing Effectiveness\nWhen your brand is cohesive and well-articulated, your marketing initiatives will be too. Branding encompasses the essential âfirst stepsâ that define Yamâs core messaging, brand personality, and marketplace position. A set of guidelines and templates that come out of branding will save Yam time, money, and frustration when developing future initiatives.\n# Specifications\nAt the core of the Yam brand is the mission statement which is presented below in both a short-form and a long-form.\n# Yamâs Mission Statement - short-form\nYam is a collaborative community innovating at the intersection of decentralized governance and programmable finance. Our open, fair and ethical philosophy fosters an inclusive and energetic culture. We are a fair-launch DAO pushing the bounds of innovation and launching experiments to enable the very promise of what DeFi can become for the world: a global, permissionless financial ecosystem.\n________________________________________\n# Yamâs Mission Statement - Long-form\nYam is a community run Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) innovating at the intersection of decentralized governance and programmable finance, bound by shared financial incentives with the goal of empowering people with greater economic benefits and financial well being within the emerging world of Decentralized Finance (DeFi). Yam mission and vision is supported via three guiding pillars.\n#### Fair and Ethical Distribution\nBy the community, for the community. We are an ultra-committed community of doers embracing an open, fair and ethical philosophy. The Yam community fosters an inclusive, energetic and collaborative culture committed to building valuable products and infrastructure that benefit the Yam community.\n#### Decentralized On-Chain Governance and Treasury\nYam is committed to decentralized protocol ownership, leveraging its powerful and forward-looking community to both build and guide the protocol forward. The community decides together how best to invest the treasury and grow the protocol which can only be performed with approval from YAM holdersâ on-chain votes.\n#### Innovation: Unique economics with cutting edge experimentation\nYam seeks to enable the very promise of what DeFi can become for the world: a global, permissionless financial ecosystem. Think of Yam as an idea factory dedicated to creating new innovations and launching experiments. Yam is therefore in uncharted waters, full of unknowns and possibilities, and we like it here. In the midst of these unknowns and possibilities, Yamâs mission serves as its north star.\n#### How Yam is different\nWhile other DeFi ecosystem players subscribe to similar goals, many make various trade-offs for efficiency, security, or profit in place of decentralization and community ownership. These tradeoffs can sometimes be rationalized, but Yam will refuse to stray from our core values, and instead drive confidently forward together with our community.\n# Poll to Measure Sentiment\nVote Yes: ratifies the Yam Mission Statement\nVote No: rejects the mission statement\n",

      "title": "YIP-19v2: Simple Ragequit Like Function aka. \"Great Yam Wall\"",
      "content": "Creator\n@Feddas\n@ToTV3\n\nBasic Summary\nA core value proposition for YAM has always been the unique value of our growing treasury model. A ragequit function has been a goal of the community as a way to create a price floor from the beginning. Full implementation of ragequit will not work as it was originally envisioned primarily because capital inside the treasury will be utilized to grow and develop the Yam ecosystem. This proposal is an alternative to initial ragequit designs and would allocate n% of the value of the treasury for use in executing buybacks if Yam Market Cap < Yam Treasury Value.\n\nAbstract\nA function will be created that is callable by anyone. Function will only be available when Yam Market Cap < Yam Treasury Value. Yam Treasury Value will not include any new Yam product tokens until they are voted on to be added to this function. When called, the function calculates the necessary size of purchase to increase Yam Market Cap => Yam Treasury Value. Funds for use in this function will be earmarked and set aside by this proposal. This will effectively create a price floor for Yam as originally proposed by ragequit by providing a strong defense for YAM as price is falling or as Treasury value rises.\n\nWhen the function is called:\nIf market cap is above book value there is no action\nIf market cap is below book value the necessary purchase as calculated by the function will be executed on the highest liquidity YAM pair.\nYAM procured by this function will be used in the most productive way possible determined by the community. This might be burning, selling, using for incentives, providing liquidity, lending, etc.\n\nThe value of funds allocated to this function should increase as the treasury grows up to a maximum cap. Options for achieving this will be determined by the developers to be a simple and easy as possible.\n\nSpecifications\nVote to determine whether or not we should move forward with this iteration of \"ragequit\". Future snapshots will determine the pool amount and potential ways to use any Yams bought using this function for the benefit of the community. \n\nChinese Translation\nåºæ¬æ»ç»\nYAMçæ ¸å¿ä»·å¼ä¸»å¼ ä¸ç´æ¯æä»¬ä¸æ­åå±çèµéæ¨¡åçç¬ç¹ä»·å¼ãæ å¤ä¸å¨çåè½å·²æä¸ºç¤¾åºçç®æ ï¼ä»ä¸å¼å§ä¾¿æ¯å»ºç«ä»·æ ¼åºéçä¸ç§æ¹æ³ãå®å¨å®æ½ragequitä¸ä¼åæåè®¾æ³çé£æ ·å¥æï¼è¿ä¸»è¦æ¯å ä¸ºå½åºåé¨çèµéå°ç¨äºåå±ååå±Yamçæç³»ç»ãè¯¥æè®®æ¯åå§æå®é¡¹ç®çæ¿ä»£æ¹æ¡ï¼å¦æYamå¸å¼<Yamå½åºä»·å¼ï¼åå°nï¼çå½åºå¸ä»·å¼åéç¨äºæ§è¡åè´­ã\n\næ½è±¡\nå°åå»ºä¸ä¸ªä»»ä½äººé½å¯ä»¥è°ç¨çå½æ°ãä»å½è¯ç±»å¸åºå¸å¼<è¯ç±»å½åºå¸ä»·å¼æ¶ï¼è¯¥åè½æå¯ç¨ã Yam Treasury Valueå°ä¸åå«ä»»ä½æ°çYamäº§åä»¤çï¼é¤éå°å¶æç¥¨éè¿æ·»å å°æ­¤åè½ãè°ç¨è¯¥å½æ°æ¶ï¼å°è®¡ç®å¿è¦çè´­ä¹°éä»¥å¢å Yamå¸å¼=> Yamå½åºä»·å¼ãè¯¥ææ¡å°é¢çä¸ç¨äºæ­¤åè½çèµéï¼å¹¶äºä»¥é¢çãå½ä»·æ ¼ä¸è·æå½åºä»·æ ¼ä¸æ¶¨æ¶ï¼è¿å°ä¸ºYam æåºä¸ä¸ªå¼ºæåçè¾©æ¤ï¼ä»èææå°ä¸ºYam æåºä»·æ ¼åºçº¿ã\n\nè°ç¨å½æ°æ¶ï¼\nå¦æå¸å¼é«äºè´¦é¢ä»·å¼ï¼åä¸ä¼éåä»»ä½æªæ½\nå¦æå¸å¼ä½äºè´¦é¢ä»·å¼ï¼åå°æ ¹æ®æµå¨æ§æé«çYAMå¯¹æ§è¡è¯¥å½æ°è®¡ç®åºçå¿è¦è´­ä¹°ã\néè¿æ­¤åè½éè´­çYAMå°ä»¥ç¤¾åºç¡®å®çæææçæ¹å¼ä½¿ç¨ãè¿å¯è½æ¯çç§ï¼åºå®ï¼ç¨äºæ¿å±ï¼æä¾æµå¨æ§ï¼è´·æ¬¾ç­ã\n\néçå½åºå¢å å°æé«éé¢ï¼åéç»è¯¥èè½çèµéä»·å¼åºå¢å ãå¼åäººåå°ç¡®å®å®ç°æ­¤ç®æ çéé¡¹ï¼ä½¿å¶å°½å¯è½ç®åæè¡ã\n\nææ¯ææ \næç¥¨å³å®æä»¬æ¯å¦åºè¯¥ç»§ç»­è¿è¡â ragequitâè¿­ä»£ãå°æ¥çå¿«ç§å°ç¡®å®æ± æ°éä»¥åä½¿ç¨éè¿æ­¤åè½è´­ä¹°çä»»ä½Yamsçæ½å¨æ¹å¼ï¼ä»¥ä½¿ç¤¾åºåçã",

      "content": "Change to Rebase Sell Percentage\n\nForum Post: https://forum.yam.finance/t/yip-drop-treasure-vault-tax-rate-to-1-from-10/638\n\nBasic Summary:\nThis is a proposal to change the percentage of a positive rebase that is minted and sold to grow the treasury. Many in the community believe the amount sold on a positive rebase to be too high, and feel the treasury does not add significant value to the protocol. While I believe the treasury adds significant value for the reasons outlined below, it is worth evaluating a change to the rebase sell amount.\n\nMotivation:\nThe initial treasury purchase level was set at the time of development, and has not been updated with community input since launch. Many in the community are unclear on how the treasury provides value, which is outlined below:\n\n- Fund development of YAM, including new products\n- Create price floor for YAM\n- Invest to earn greater return\n- Use in new products to bootstrap liquidity\n\nThese goals can be better accomplished with a larger treasury, but at the same time, the current treasury of $2.8M can effectively accomplish many of these initiatives in the short term. By lowering the purchase amount for the time being we can build confidence in the treasuryâs value, and potentially increase again in the future, or find a new mechanism for raising treasury funds. \n\nIt should also be noted that we are currently in the process of leveraging the treasury in several ways that add meaningful value to the protocol, and plan to continue building on these foundations:\n\n1. Yam Dao Set Investment Arm. We will be using the treasury to directly invest in crypto and defi, please read here for more information: https://forum.yam.finance/t/yam-investment-portfolio-description-and-current-road-map/906\nFeel free to join the discussion: https://discord.com/channels/743654257642700911/775887008429506570/777321622956277802\n2. Great Yam Wall. The current \"rage quit\" solution. Will be allocating a % of the treasury to directly buy YAM from the market if the YAM Market Cap < Yam Treasury Value. When we increase the treasury it should also increase the market cap as well. https://forum.yam.finance/t/specification-for-a-simple-ragequit-like-function/938\n3. Umbrella. Will be our smart contract insurance protocol. It is currently under development and the team has some great ideas that will provide much needed insurance to defi smart contracts. We will likely seed the insurance protection by using the treasury, and the income will go to the treasury.\n\nTo illustrate the various differences, here is an example:\nCurrent YAM Supply: 8,700,000\nExample price: $1.50\nDeviation from Peg: (1.50 - 1) / 1 = .5\nRebaseLag = 20\nChange in Supply = 8,700,000 * (.5 / 20) = 217,500 YAMs\n\n1% Rebase Sell Amount: 2,170 YAMs (less than 1% market impact)\n5% Rebase Sell Amount: 10,875 YAMs (1-2% market impact)\n10% Rebase Sell Amount: 21,750 YAMs (approx. 3% market impact)\n\nSpecification:\nAdjustment to Rebaser\n\nThe final rebase sell percentage will be based on a weighted average.\n\næ´æ¹å°éæ°åºçè´­ä¹°éé¢\n\nè®ºåå¸å­ï¼ https://forum.yam.finance/t/yip-drop-treasure-vault-tax-rate-to-1-from-10/638\n\nåºæ¬æè¦ï¼\n\nè¿æ¯ä¸ä¸ªå»ºè®®ï¼æ¹åä¸ä¸ªæ­£éåºçç¾åæ¯ï¼é¸é ååºå®ï¼ä»¥å¢é¿å½åºãè®¸å¤ç¤¾åºäººå£«è®¤ä¸ºï¼å¨æ­£éåºä¸åºå®çéé¢è¿é«ï¼è®¤ä¸ºå½åºå¹¶æ²¡æä¸ºåè®®å¢å æ¾èä»·å¼ãè½ç¶æè®¤ä¸ºå½åºä¼å ä¸ºä¸é¢æ¦è¿°çåå èå¢å éå¤§ä»·å¼ï¼ä½å¼å¾è¯ä¼°å¯¹éæ°åºç¡éå®éé¢çåå¨ã\n\nå¨æºï¼\n\nåå§å½åºè´­ä¹°æ°´å¹³æ¯å¨å¼åæ¶è®¾å®çï¼èªæ¨åºä»¥æ¥æªä½¿ç¨ç¤¾åºæå¥è¿è¡æ´æ°ãç¤¾åºä¸­çè®¸å¤äººä¸æ¸æ¥å½åºå¦ä½æä¾ä»·å¼ï¼æ¦è¿°å¦ä¸ï¼\n\nYAMçåºéåå±ï¼åæ¬æ°äº§å\n\nä¸º YAM åå»ºä»·æ ¼ä¸å±\n\næèµä»¥èµåæ´å¤§çåæ¥\n\nå¨æ°äº§åä¸­ä½¿ç¨ä»¥å¼å¯¼æµå¨æ§\n\néè¿æ´å¤§çå½åºå¯ä»¥æ´å¥½å°å®ç°è¿äºç®æ ï¼ä½ä¸æ­¤åæ¶ï¼ç®å2.8Mç¾åçå½åºå¯ä»¥å¨ç­æåææå°å®æè®¸å¤è¿äºäºæãéè¿éä½è´­ä¹°éé¢ï¼æä»¬å¯ä»¥å»ºç«å¯¹å½åºä»·å¼çä¿¡å¿ï¼å¹¶å¯è½å¨æªæ¥åæ¬¡å¢å ï¼ææ¾å°ä¸ä¸ªæ°çæºå¶ï¼ä»¥ç­¹éå½åºèµéã\n\nè¿åºå½æåºï¼æä»¬ç®åæ­£å¨ä»¥è¥å¹²æ¹å¼å©ç¨å½åºï¼ä¸ºè®®å®ä¹¦å¢å ææä¹çä»·å¼ï¼å¹¶è®¡åç»§ç»­å¨è¿äºåºç¡ä¸åå±ï¼\n\n1.

Submit both ETH/DPI to Uniswap Liquidity Pool.\n2. Take Uniswap LP Tokens and stake those on Indexcoop.com which will farm Index tokens at a ~55% APY (unstable).\n\nMotivation\nOur goal is to increase the value of the Yam Treasury.\nThe larger the Yam Treasury they more we can utilize to funds to develop the Yam ecosystem.\nUsing assets already in the treasury (DPI and ETH) to gain additional yield is advantageous but we must evaluate the risks.\n\nRisks and mitigating factors:\n\n1. (Minimal Risk / High Value Loss) Indexcoop farming contract bug or exploit.\na. Indexcoop developers are the same people who created tokenset.com\nb. Farming contract is a fork of Uniswap\n2. (Minimal Risk / High Value Loss) Uniswap Liquidity Pool bug or exploit.\na. Lindy effect â Uniswap has been battle tested since 2018.\n3. (Minimal Risk / Low Value Loss) Providing Liquidity in a Uniswap Pool is subject to Impermanent Loss (IL).\na. Explained here: https://finematics.com/impermanent-loss-explained/\nb. As an LP we do collect trading fees from the pool, which can easily offset Impermanent Loss.\nc. DPI and ETH are highly correlated, which mitigates the risk of IL.\n\nRisks overall are minimal but possible.\n\nSpecifications\n\n1. Informal review of Indexcoopâs contracts.\n2. Provide Liquidity on DPI/ETH pool at Uniswap\n3. Stake Uniswap LP tokens on Indexcoop.\n4. Claim INDEX tokens every 2 weeks (or whatever timeframe devs think is best) and Hold tokens in treasury",

      "content": "You can view the discussion here: https://forum.yam.finance/t/pause-liquidity-incentives-until-yam-eth-update/821\n\n## Basic Summary\nWe are currently paying approximately 70k BoU YAMs in incentives to LPs, despite consistent negative rebases which do not utilize this liquidity. We propose to pause incentives for LPs and reinstate them on the YAM/ETH pool. By doing so, we could save as much as 164k BoU YAMs (currently 763k YAMs) of the total 925k BoU YAMs currently allocated for liquidity incentives - approximately 17.7%. The final number are dependent upon when this proposal would be executed onchain and when ETH/YAM incentives begin. \n\n\n## Abstract\nThe incentivizer contract has a simple breaker switch to turn off incentives at the end of a weeklong cycle. We would utilize this breaker to pause incentives on YAM/yUSD, in order to use our current rewards budget more effectively.\nIt is important to note, this is not reducing or removing the total amount of rewards that will be distributed. It is shifting the timing of those rewards to maximize their impact and value to the protocol.\n## Motivation\nPausing incentives on YAM/yUSD would have several benefits:\n - It would prevent the protocol from continuing to pay for liquidity it is not using.\n - Increase ease of governance participation until the LP voting is implemented\n - Does not decrease the amount allocated to LP rewards â it just shifts the timing to better align the incentive program with protocol needs and market conditions\n - If positive rebases do occur while incentives are paused and liquidity is low, we will simply see small rebases that quickly hit 5% slippage and YAM accrue to the treasury.\n## Specifications\nDue to the liquidity incentives operating on a weekly cycle, once a cycle is started it must be completed. In order to get the most benefit from this proposal, it would need to be enacted onchain by 8PM UTC October 17, meaning a on-chain proposal must be submitted by 8AM UTC October 15. \n\nIf positive quorum is reached after 24 hours, it may proceed to on-chain proposal, per YIP 3: https://snapshot.page/#/yam/proposal/QmdBiJuXFtYephsmz9mWF9WoDDrnYtAVaGAPkoB8QrF76h\n",

This will help diversify the treasury away from full exposure to yUSD tail risk, give exposure to the rise of DeFi, increase awareness by aligning with a popular DeFi info resource, and demonstrate a major use case of the treasury.\n\nMotivation\n\nYAM is currently heavily exposed to the risks of yUSD including DAI, USDC, TUSD, and USDT risk, Curve smart contract risk, and Yearn Vault smart contract risk. By allocating treasury funds to the DPI Set, we diversify some of that risk.\n\nWhile we are eliminating potential downside risk, we also get exposure to new upside. By investing in a basket of DeFi cryptocurrencies, the YAM treasury has the opportunity to grow alongside the broader DeFi markets, rather than solely relying on stablecoin yield.\n\nFinally, this showcases one of the fundamental use cases of the treasury by investing in other DeFi assets and interacting with other DeFi protocols.\n\nRisks\n\nWhile we limit the risk exposure to yUSD, but do take on price risk to the underlying DPI assets as well as TokenSets smart contract risk.\n\nSpecifications\n\nAn on-chain governance vote would use treasury funds to purchase the DeFi Pulse Index Set.",

While it has been assumed that YAM value would be linked to the Treasury, this proposal would make it official that YAM will be backed by the Treasury and immediately signal a price floor.\n\nMotivation\nWith market volatility and a complex story to tell (elastic finance), YAM price has fallen significantly since launch. This function would create a hard price floor, as arbitrage would exist if the Treasury ever exceeded market cap. It also creates a clear story that YAM holders are entitled a portion of the Treasury. (While not widely used, YFI launched with a burn mechanism that created narratives about how YFI holders are entitled to Yearn revenue and immediately established a price floor.) A vote For would immediately signal that this will become official, even if it is not yet developed, thus creating an immediate price floor based on our rapidly growing Treasury value.\n\nSpecifications\nMechanisms to be developed further in discussion with the community. This initial vote is to first determine officially whether we should or should not develop this function. This does not preclude other solutions, such as staking, from being proposed or developed. (RageQuit was originally named by MolochDAO. This proposal uses the name as a temporary shortcut; the official naming can be decided later with the community.)",

      "content": "Link to forum: https://forum.yam.finance/t/yip-sync-support-for-sushiswap-yam-eth-pool/615\n\nBasic Summary\n\nWe propose to add an additional sync call, on the YAM/ETH (YAMv3) Sushiswap pool, to the Yam rebaser.\n\nAbstract\n\nThere is currently an incentivized (via SUSHI rewards) YAMv2/ETH pool on Sushiswap. In order for those incentives to move to the YAM/ETH pool on Sushiswap, the Yam protocol must first call sync on the pool during rebases so it is safe to add liquidity to.\n\nMotivation\n\nThe fact that YAMv2 tokens can be used to liquidity mine SUSHI has contributed to the price disparity between YAMv2 and YAM, where the v2 tokens are trading at up to a 50% premium to YAMv2 tokens at times. We are expecting that once this pool is syncd during rebase, Sushiswap will be able to switch their incentives to the YAMv3/ETH pool. This would hopefully bring down the price disparity as well as allow more YAMv2 to migrate and participate in the community and governance. There is, however, no guarantee that Sushiswap will end up incentivizing a YAM/ETH pool, as that is dependent on their governance process.\n\nSpecifications\n\nAn on-chain governance proposal to call yamRebaser.addSyncPairs([0x95b54c8da12bb23f7a5f6e26c38d04acc6f81820], []) is all that is required for this.",

Once in the treasury, any transaction the treasury wishes to take also requires multiple steps to exit yUSD. By switching the treasury purchase asset from yUSD to ETH, the protocol will be able to solve the liquidity issues and allow for more future flexibility in treasury allocation.\n\nMotivation\n\nSolve liquidity issues and have more treasury flexibility.\n\nSpecifications\n\nWe would need to make modifications to the rebaser to purchase from the YAM/ETH pool and utilize a combination of the YAM/ETH TWAP Uniswap oracle and ETH/USDC TWAP Uniswap oracle to target a price of $1.00 as opposed to 1 yUSD. Additionally, we would need to turn off the YAM/yUSD incentivizer contract and deploy a new YAM/ETH incentivizer contract (with the same rewards to start).",

This means individuals farming YAM on the incentivized pool are unable to vote. In order to allow farmers to vote, modifications to the protocol will need to be made.\n\nMotivation\n\nDue to the fact that voting weight is based only on an accountâs YAM balance/delegates at the time a proposal is created, individuals in the incentivized LP pool are unable to vote. This causes a lot of difficulty for those individuals since they need to exit the pool, wait for the proposal to be created, and rejoin. It would be ideal to let these individuals vote without putting in the extra work or need to choose between voting and farming.\n\nSpecifications\n\nThe following technical changes will be required to accomplish this:\n\n    Make Uniswap pool delegate to itself\n\n    Make Incentivizer have checkpointing/delegation like YAM has\n\n    Have YAM.delegate update delegation on the Incentivizer as well\n\n    Add governance function to allow governance to make a contract delegate to self\n\n    `Incentivizer.getPriorVotes` would do `YAM.getPriorVotes(uniswapPool, proposalCreationBlock - 1) * getUserStakedLPBalanceAtBlock(user, proposalCreationBlock - 1) / getTotalStakedLPAtBlock(proposalCreationBlock - 1)`\n\n    Update governance module to use `YAM.getPriorVotes(user, proposalCreationBlock - 1) + Incentivizer.getPriorVotes(user, proposalCreationBlock - 1)` as voting weight\n\nAn audit will also be required, which the team is currently in the process of arranging.",

Each will receive a Snapshot proposal, and successful Snapshots will be grouped into a single on-chain proposal.\n\nMaxSlippage decrease - This would limit the market impact that a treasury purchase can have.

We propose to use Gitcoin Grant audit and potentially treasury funds to sponsor a bug bounty program for the YAM protocol. Rewards will be tiered based on severity of issue disclosed.\n\nMotivation\nMake Yam more secure.\n\nSpecifications\nRewards will be based on the CVSS (Common Vulnerability Scoring Standard) but ultimately subject to tokenholder vote. In the event of a vulnerability disclosure, an emergency proposal will be sent immediately for on-chain governance execution, skipping the typical forum and off-chain steps in the process in order to expedite the fix. Such a proposal would include both the fix and reward to the discoverer of the vulnerability.\n\nFunding of the bug bounty will first come from the Gitcoin Grants audit fund, though once this has been depleted, future funding will be sourced from the treasury.\n\nRewards will be scaled according to the severity of the bug.\n\nCritical - Max Reward\nHigh - 50% of Max Reward\nMedium - 20% of Max Reward\nLow - 5% of Max Reward\n\nWe will use a weighted average of the below votes to determine the Max Reward for the bug bounty.",

      "content": "Hi Yamers, my name is Jimmy I am a system engineer. YAM first come to my attention after the price crash due to bugs in a smart contract. I have been closely following YAM development including the V2 migration and this latest governance proposal.\n\nIn order for YAM to move forward, a good YIP(YAM Improvement Proposal) system is urgently needed. While I see most of the new proposal here in one or another way asking for support for their proposal on governance system and etc... I strongly believe that the first and most important thing to do now is \"TO ESTABLISH A YIP SYSTEM BEFORE MOVING FORWARD TO ANY OTHER PROPOSAL\".\n\nAfter some discussion I come to the following proposal :\n\n1) We Urgently Need To Establish A YIP System Before Proposing Any New Proposal\nThe main reason behind this is that the YIP system serve as a backbone for any new proposal before they can be agreed and implemented by the community.  Without a YIP system anyone can suggest a new proposal and things will become complicated fast before a solution can be found.\n\n2) Any New Proposal Must Obtain Simple % of Vote Before Becoming Officail Suggested Proposal\n\n3) Official Suggested Proposal Must Obtain Certain % of Vote And Cannot Exceed Certain % of Rejection Before Qualified As An Official Proposal\n\nThe 2 tiers system that I proposed above should be able to eliminate the weak proposal and allow majority community members to focus their precious time on studying only on the official suggested proposal (rather than all new proposals) before they vote to accept or reject the proposal.\n\nAs you can see I did not list specific % of vote require in 2) and 3) above, this is because I strongly believe that the community should be allowed to decide this after this proposal had been accepted.\n\nLastly, please give me your support on the YIP(YAM Improvement Proposal) System to make YAMv3 a better system.

      "content": "Abstract\nThe community was asked to delegate their YAM tokens before Aug 13, 7AM UTC in order to reach the required quorum to submit the proposal. However, the delegator snapshot was taken 55 blocks after 7AM UTC when the actual proposal was submitted. The team could have submitted the proposal in the first block mined after 7AM UTC, block #10650133. Some community members might have delegated their tokens before the deadline, but might have not been included in the snapshot. They were hurt the most.\n\nMotivation\nThe main objective of delegating YAM tokens was to reach the quorum for proposal submission. The team decided on the 7AM deadline. The team was also very vocal about keeping the tokens in the wallet and not moving them for 3 days until the voting ends. However, the second ask wasnât the priority at that time. After successful proposal submission, there would be more than enough time to coordinate with the community all the steps required before the actual voting would take place.\n\nSome community members might have realized these nuances, proactively delegated their tokens so the proposal could have been submitted and moved their YAM tokens to Uniswap LP in > 1 block after 7AM UTC but less than 55 blocks after 7AM UTC when the snapshot was taken. They would be ready to move their tokens back to their wallets once the team/community would decide on the voting specifics (e.g. when the voting would take place).\n\nThese community members were hurt the most. Not only were they not included in the snapshot, they also got severely hit by the impermeant loss. On the other hand, some community members (including insiders) might have dumped their tokens right after the proposal was submitted. Not only were they included in the snapshot and will be part of the future governance, they also handsomely profited thanks to Uniswap liquidity providers.\n\nSpecifications\nTake delegator snapshot at block #10650187, the first block mined after the deadline.\n\n\n\n\n",

This will help build excitement for the return of YAM and to seed the YAM treasury to fund the purchase of assets and future experiments to expand YAM.\n\nWhen v3 launches, there will be users who do not yet own YAM who want to purchase YAM to take part in the experiment. This demand to purchase YAM will put upward pressure on the price. By restricting the amount of YAM initially available to buy on the market through the vesting recommended in this proposal, this may improve the price heading into the initial rebases.\n\nVesting of tokens, including vesting of YAM awarded to addresses that delegates voted in the attempt to save YAMv1 and YAM awarded to liquidity providers, will also help to align incentives and to encourage longer-term engagement with all users of the YAM platform.",

This only provides assurance to the community that good faith and honest actions will not be forgotten and is duly responded.\n\nI propose the current reward in to the delegators as indicated in YIP-2 be multiplied by 3.",

All valid proposals and amendments passing with quorum at that time and not superseded by a conflicting proposal will be implemented in V3.\n\nThis timeline ensures all currently valid proposals will have time to conclude, with the exception of the proposal to create a more formal YIP process. While this idea is valuable, the governance process will necessarily change with the fully functional V3 protocol, and a proposal framework can be developed through community dialogue without a V2 vote. \n\nItem 2:\n\nWe propose the following audit details:\n\nAuditor: Peckshield Inc.\nCost: $28,000\nLength: 3.5 person-weeks\nRate: $8,000/person-week\nStart Date: Week of 8/31/2020\nCompletion: Approximately two weeks after start\n\nThis option was chosen based on auditor availability, as well as the fact that Peckshield is already familiar with the codebase due to their work on V1 to V2 migration.\n\nItem 3:\n\nWe propose the remaining funds from the Gitcoin audit grant will be used to fund future audits and a bug bounty program to be instituted at launch, at the launch teamâs discretion.\n",

      "content": "Note 1: This proposal is being resubmitted [after the original proposal was marked as 'noncompliant' due to a technicality](https://discordapp.com/channels/743654257642700911/743654718664081492/747856405704343622).\n\n[Note 2: This proposal is \"trivial to implement and would not slow down development\"](https://discordapp.com/channels/743654257642700911/747549526969286788/747611626194206913)\n\nThis proposal, if ratified, would redirect 1% of all inflows to the treasury to a [Gitcoin Grants Wallet](https://etherscan.io/address/0x232C95A72F132392171831cEcEc8c1161975c398), in order to support public goods in the Ethereum ecosystem. If ratified, every funding from the YAM treasury that went to the Gitcoin Grants wallet would be 100% used for public goods funding for the Ethereum ecosystem.  This funding would be allocated to the [*Tech* Grants](https://gitcoin.co/grants/tech?) category.\n\nThis proposal was motivated by [a tweet from Nick Dodson](https://twitter.com/iamnickdodson/status/1294264371489767424?s=21 ).  There is plenty of discussion on that thread to checkout as you weigh your votes.\n\nFor the uninitiated, Gitcoin Grants is like a crypto-style patreon, powered by [Quadratic Funding](https://wtfisqf.com), that has [delivered over $2.5mm of funding to Ethereum projects since Jan 2019](https://gitcoin.co/results).  For more on Gitcoin, checkout these reviews of Gitcoin Grants and QF \n- [Round 3 Review](https://vitalik.ca/general/2019/10/24/gitcoin.html)\n- [Round 4 Review](https://vitalik.ca/general/2020/01/28/round4.html)\n- [Round 5 Review](https://vitalik.ca/general/2020/04/30/round5.html)\n- [Round 6 Review](https://vitalik.ca/general/2020/07/21/round6.html)\n\nThere are many promising projects in the community that support public goods (like ETH1/ETH2 development, L2 research, media, education, etc).  Given Gitcoin's long history of successfully supporting public goods on Ethereum at scale, without being captured, through a tough bear market, I believe Gitcoin is the strongest contender at the current moment, in this category.\n\nThere are two main reasons that I believe this is a good idea for the YAM community:\n1.  **Karma** -- Gitcoin Grants played a part in funding the transition form v1 => v2 [see this link](https://gitcoin.co/grants/1059/yam-protocol-audit). \n2. **High ROI Community Goodwill & Publicity**.  We can shift the narrative around YAMs being a \"degen\" project to having some \"regen\" effects to the ecosystem, like funding the base layer upon which it depends.  This will make YAMs part of the broader conversation around [rainbow colored money](https://thedefiant.substack.com/p/rainbow-colored-money-the-story-behind) in the Ethereum ecosystem, and public goods funding in the information age.\n\nIf this proposal passes, I will commit to the following:\n1. 100% of the tokens that go to this wallet from the YAM contracts will be sent to public goods (minus gas fees, which I expect to be fairly negligible).\n2. Prominently listing YAMs as a co-funder of Gitcoin Grants Rounds, for each round it contributes funding.\n3. I would be happy to provide a report back to the YAM community on where the YAM funds went, once per quarter, for every quarter in which the value that the YAM system provided to Gitcoin Grants was more than $10k USD.\n\nI appreciate the consideration that the community has given to this proposal\nGitcoin Founder, [Kevin Owocki](https://twitter.com/owocki)",

This would make liquidity added to that pool safe from losing funds during rebase. This proposal does not include any additional incentives to be provided to LPs on this pool.\n\nReasoning:\nDue to the fact that Uniswap tracks token balances internally, assets that rebase (like YAM) need to explicitly call sync() during rebase or a portion of the assets pooled can be stolen after rebase. Since ETH is the top pooled asset on Uniswap, it makes sense that we would want to encourage liquidity on the ETH-YAMv3 pool as well.\nYAMv1 saw people adding liquidity on the YAMv1-ETH pool (>$100k worth at its peak), unknowingly putting those funds at risk.",

      "content": "Summary:\nThis proposal would shift governance away from YAM to instead use BPT from a balancer pool with 80% YAM/20 WETH similar to Aave's new governance system outlined here - https://medium.com/aave/aavenomics-eeab650cccc2. This proposal would also add functionality to the rebaser to call gulp() on this pool during rebase. This would make liquidity added to the pool safe from losing funds during rebase. This proposal does not include any additional incentives to be provided to LPs on this pool.\n\nReasoning:\nThis would massively increase YAM trading liquidity over the current system where people must hold YAM in their wallet to participate in governance. With a modest fee of 1% on the balancer pool, LP's can reasonably expect a three figure APY from fees alone. It would be easy to get YAM whitelisted for weekly BAL rewards as well. Calling gulp() during rebase will protect LP funds from being stolen as is typically the case with rebasing tokens on balancer. \n\nThis would be a novel approach to governance but the benefits are significant. Governance participants would see a very high APY while significantly increasing YAM liquidity for trading and it requires no incentive on the part of YAM protocol.",

There are three steps to go.\n\n1. Short-term: YAM wallet issues a new tokens named Yamily(Yamy), partly used for airdrops to YAMv2 moved to YAMv3 holders, which can increase membersâ centripetal force to the community and stimulates the price raising of YAMv3; partial tokens are used for private and crowd sale, It can greatly increase the financial income of the community,  also throw a high expectation of YAM Wallet and YAMv3âs launch to the public.\n2. Mid-term: Once the YAM wallet is launched, partial tokens be used as lottery rewards for the mining user, which can attract new users rushing into the pool, but users need to only go through the YAM wallet to enter the mining pool. There're three effects following--YAM walletâs popularity, the rapid increasing users in mining pools, and the higher price expectations of YAMv3.\n3. Long-term: Become decentralized banking system, compatible with cryptocurrency and fiat currency, link crypto financial services in the physical world, further to change the global fiat currency financial system. (The specific approach is still to be discussed)\n\nThe distribution of YAM wallet tokens: \n10% for airdrop, \n30% for sale, \n20% for mining pool lotto rewards,\n  8% for wallet development team rewards, \n  2% for proposal rewards, \n30% as the executive teamâs salary and ecosystem maintenance. \nThe time is on the clerk, executive details authorizes the project team to decide.\nI think this proposal can be a proper way to meet the interests of all community members, and will not cause the YAMv3 price to fall rapidly after the mining pool is exhausted; in the long-term development, the YAM community can also create a new Defi aspect. \nby Hanson\n",

      "content": "Trent Elmore and Brock Elmore submit the following proposal to increase delegator rewards.\n\nWhile I believe the initial proposal was well in line with the expectations set, it has become apparent that many in the community disagree with the existing reward structure. Delegators showed great faith in the team and project, took on risk in showing this support, and are extremely valuable community members.\n\nMany argue that delegators should not only be recouped for opportunity cost, but rewarded more generally for their commitment to the project. I agree and believe that, in return, it is fair that the community ask for their continued support of the project.\n\nI propose a modification to the flat + scaled approach proposed in YIP-2: All delegators with votes equal to or less than 20 votes will receive a flat 20 YAMv3 reward, while all delegators with over 20 votes will receive a 1:1 reward. This ensures every delegator receives at least a 1:1 reward, whereas the original YIP-2 allocated some delegators significantly more than 1:1 and some significantly less.\n\nRewards breakdown:\n- Equal to or Under 20 YAM Delegated: 2,100 delegators * 20 YAM = 42,000 YAMv3\n- Over 20 YAM Delegated 1:1 = 290,665 YAMv3\n- Total Delegator Rewards: 332,665 YAMv3\n\nIn total, this is a 92% (~159k) increase in delegator rewards, and delegators will receive 6.6% of the network, not including the potential community fund.\n\nRather than being immediately vested, however, these rewards will be unvested over a 1 month period, streamed on a block-by-block basis. This will promote the continued engagement of the delegator community.\n\nIn order to keep the total V3 supply in line with YIP-2 and YIP-12 potential supplies, I also propose to decrease the total LP Pool rewards from 1.1M to 940,923, following the same distribution scheme leading to ~282k in rewards the first week, decreasing by 30% each week.\n\nI also propose that any rounding necessary to bring the supply to a whole number be left to developer discretion.\n\nFinally, I propose that should this proposal be passed, additional proposals relating to delegator rewards will be considered invalid. \n\nTL;DR:\n- Delegators with equal or under 20 votes receive 20 YAM\n- Delegators with more than 20 votes receive 1:1 reward\n- Total Rewards 332,665 (92% increase from YIP-2)\n- Rewards unvested over 1 month timeframe\n- Decrease LP rewards from 1.1M to ~941k\n- Rounding discretion to developer\n- No further delegator rewards proposals\n",

      "content": "Trent Elmore, Brock Elmore, Will Price, Clinton Bembry, and Dan Elitzer propose the following measures to be implemented for the launch of YAMv3 based on discussions with the YAM community over the past two weeks. Our motivation for submitting this proposal is to ensure an efficient transition from V2 to V3 that addresses mission-critical issues in the most fair way for the largest amount of the community possible. We believe this is the best path forward, but it is up to the community to decide, this is not an exhaustive list of possible changes, and we do expect additional proposals to be submitted.\n\nAs mentioned in the Proposal Mechanics proposal, anyone can submit further proposals which may supersede and/or iterate upon the below.\n\nItem 1: Minor Protocol Updates\n\nWe propose the following protocol updates. While there are many ideas on how the Yam protocol can be improved, we find it prudent to focus on minor updates that improve upon V1 with limited overhead.\n\n- Update reserve asset to yUSD (yyCRV), which has higher yield potential than yCRV\n- Replace YAMv1/yCRV sync() call on Uniswap V2 with YAMv3/yUSD sync() call\n- Hardcode proposal (50K pre-rebase) and quorum (200k pre-rebase) thresholds\n- Make voting period 2 days instead of 3 for quicker governance action\n- Complete audit of fully functional YAMv3 protocol\n\nItem 2: YAMv3 Incentivization Distribution\n\nWe propose a single farming pool be established on the YAMv3/yUSD (yyCRV) Uniswap V2 LP pool. The first week of incentives will begin one hour after V3 launch and total 330,000 YAMv3. Incentives will be reduced by 30% each week, resulting in a total of 1.1MM YAMv3 tokens distributed to stakers. \n\nWe also propose a 1MM YAMv3 community fund, held outside the reserve in a separate community fund contract. This fund will be controlled by V3 governance, will not impact quorum requirements for voting, and can be used as the community sees fit. Uses may include but are not limited to new incentivized pools or ecosystem development initiatives.\n\nTL;DR:\n- YAM/yUSD LP Incentivized  Staking Pool, initial weekly issuance of 330k YAMv3, decreasing 30% each week, totaling 1.1MM.\n- 1MM YAMv3 Community Fund\n\nItem 3: YAMv2 to YAMv3 Migration\n\nWe propose a 1:1 migration for YAMv2 holders. A migration contract with no deadline will be created, which will allow YAMv2 holders to burn their YAMv2 tokens in exchange for YAMv3 tokens.\n\nTL;DR:\n- 1:1 migration from V2 to V3 via migration contract\n\nItem 4: Delegator Rewards\n\nWe propose utilizing a snapshot taken at the time of the #saveyam governance proposal to reward delegators utilizing a âflat and scaledâ reward model. The list of delegators can be found here: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yam-finance/yam-protocol/master/yam_delegator_snapshot_10650187_draft.json\n\nThe rewards will also be used to bring the total supply of YAMv3 to a round number, by the following calculation:\n\n (YAMv3 Total Supply) - (Community Fund) - (LP Pool Incentives) -  (YAMv2 Total Supply) = (Delegator Rewards)\n\nTotal delegator rewards will be approximately 173,588.383 YAMv3. We propose to distribute half (approximately 86,794.192) of these rewards on a flat basis to the 3,173 delegators, rewarding each delegate with approximately 27.354 YAMv3 tokens. The remaining 86,794.192 YAMv3 tokens will be distributed to delegators in proportion to their percentage of total votes delegated. This structure compensates small holders for their efforts and incurred transaction fees, as well as compensating all holders for their proportional impact.\n\nThese delegator rewards will be fully vested on V3 launch.\n\nTL;DR:\n- Approximately 173k in rewards, half distributed on flat scale to all delegators, half distributed proportional to voting contribution\n\nProposal Summary:\n\nTotal V3 Supply: 6,000,000\n\nProtocol Updates: \n- Update reserve asset to yUSD (yyCRV), which has higher yield potential than yCRV.\n- Call sync() on Uniswap V2 YAMv3/yUSD pool\n- Hardcode proposal (50K) and quorum (200k) thresholds\n- Make voting period 2 days instead of 3\n- Complete audit of fully functional YAMv3 protocol\n\nFarming and Incentives:\n- YAM/yUSD LP Pool, receiving 330k YAMv3, decreasing 30% each week, totalling 1.1M.\n- 1M YAMv3 Community Fund\n\nMigration: \n- 1:1 migration from V2 to V3\n\nDelegator Rewards:\n- Approximately 173k in rewards, half distributed equally to all delegators, half distributed according to a linear scale of voting contribution\n\nOnce again, this proposal is made by the individuals who originally launched YAM, and reflects our thoughts on how to best proceed. Ultimately, it is up to the community of YAM to decide, and proposals meeting the minimum requirements may supersede or iterate upon this proposal.\n",

      "content": "Hi Yamers, my nanme is Jimmy I am a system engineer. YAM first come to my attention after the price crash due to bugs in a smart contract. I have been closely following YAM development including the V2 migration and this latest governance proposal.\n\nIn order for YAM to move forward, a good YIP(YAM Improvement Proposal) system is urgently needed. While I see most of the new proposal here in one or another way asking for support for their proposal on governance system and etc... I strongly believe that the first and most important thing to do now is \"TO ESTABLISH A YIP SYSTEM BEFORE MOVING FORWARD TO ANY OTHER PROPOSAL\".\n\nAfter some discussion I come to the following proposal :\n\n1) We Urgently Need To Establish A YIP System Before Proposing Any New Proposal\n\nThe main reason behind this is that the YIP system serve as a backbone for any new proposal before they can be agreed and implemented by the community.  Without a YIP system anyone can suggest a new proposal and things will become complicated fast before any solution can be found. As a proof of my point there are around 40 new proposals which is to many for the community to digest at the time of my writing.\n\n2) Any New Proposal Must Obtain Simple % of Vote Before Becoming Official Suggested Proposal\n\n3) Official Suggested Proposal Must Obtain Certain % of Vote And Cannot Exceed Certain % of Rejection Before Qualified As An Official Proposal\n\nThe 2 tiers system that I proposal above should be able to eliminate the weak proposal and allow majority community members to focus their precious time on studying only on the official suggested proposal (rather than all new proposals) before they vote to accept or reject a proposal.\n\nAs you can see I did not list specific % of vote require in 2) and 3) above, this is because I strongly believe that the community should be allowed to decide this after this proposal had been accepted.\n\nLastly, please give me your support and vote to make YAM a better system. Thank you.",

      "content": "This proposal would shift governance away from YAM to instead use BPT from a balancer pool with 80% YAM/20 WETH similar to Aave's new governance system outlined here - https://medium.com/aave/aavenomics-eeab650cccc2. This proposal would also add functionality to the rebaser to call gulp() on this pool during rebase. This would make liquidity added to the pool safe from losing funds during rebase. This proposal does not include any additional incentives to be provided to LPs on this pool.\n\nReasoning:\nThis would massively increase YAM trading liquidity over the current system where people must hold YAM in their wallet to participate in governance. With a modest fee of 1% on the balancer pool, LP's can reasonably expect a three figure APY from fees alone. It would be easy to get YAM whitelisted for weekly BAL rewards as well. Calling gulp() during rebase will protect LP funds from being stolen as is typically the case with rebasing tokens on balancer.\n\nThis would be a novel approach to governance but the benefits are significant. Governance participants would see a very high APY while significantly increasing YAM liquidity for trading and it requires no incentive on the part of YAM protocol.",

This isn't even a 1:1 reward. Under this model, delegators will receive a fraction of their original delegated amount as rewards. This proposal would remove the flat-reward model specified in YIP-2, correctly quantify the amount of YAMv1 delegated, multiply this amount by 2x, and distribute them by address on a pro-rata basis. \n\nMotivation\nYAMv1 delegators are not getting sufficiently compensated for doing all they could to save YAM. Individuals who delegated, exited the YAM/yCrv pool which was yielding 100% ROI. These individuals also implicitly committed to staying out of the pool for 3 days and essentially missing out on a 300% ROI. \n\nThe official YAM twitter even indicated that the original intention was that delegators would get \"significantly more\" YAM than those who remained in the pool. \nhttps://twitter.com/YamFinance/status/1293739908721446912\nUnder the current model proposed in YIP-2, this is not the case. \n\nYIP-2 calculated delegator rewards of 173,588.383, while 242,953 YAMv1 was delegated to save YAM. The proposed rewards do not even account all the YAM that was delegated to save YAM (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yam-finance/yam-protocol/master/yam_delegator_snapshot_10650187_draft.json).\n\nProposal\n1. Correctly account for all the YAMv1 that was delegated (242,953), and multiply that by 2x. \n2.

Should this proposal be passed, past and future proposals that do not conform to these mechanics will be considered invalid.\n\nWhile the original launchers of Yam will be submitting proposals, this framework is intended to make clear that anyone meeting the minimum requirements is able to submit proposals, some of which may supersede ours. The power and value of YAM lies in the YAM community, and we are excited to see what the community brings to the table in this interim period and in YAMv3.\n\nIt should be noted that any proposal may not be implemented without approval from the YAM community. \n\nWe're also thrilled and humbled by the support we've received from many in the DeFi community that have rallied behind us. One special shout out we'd like to give is to the Balancer and Snapshot Labs teams who built and are hosting this governance portal. This was something they did not have to do but graciously offered as we sought ways to limit our influence over this process.\n\nItem 1:\n\nWe propose a 3 day minimum voting period, with a maximum voting period of 7 days. This will ensure tokenholders have adequate time to assess proposals and vote, while also ensuring an efficient process.\n\nItem 2:\n\nWe propose all proposals must have a deadline prior to September 7, 2020, to ensure adequate time for code implementation prior to audit. This means the latest that a proposal can be submitted is September 4, 2020.\n\nItem 3:\n\nWe propose that all proposals not approved by the deadline must be resubmitted in YAMv3 governance to be considered for implementation.\n\nItem 4: \n\nWe propose that a minimum of 100 YAMv2 be required to submit a proposal. This is to prevent proposal overload and ensure an efficient V2 to V3 governance process.\n\nItem 5:\n\nWe propose to utilize the 4% quorum requirement initially set in V1 for approval of YAMv2 governance decisions.\n\nItem 6:\n\nWe propose that when submitting a proposal, a block height for a snapshot of balances must be chosen. The snapshot of balances will serve as ground truth for voting power. This block must be the current block at the time of proposal start time (+/- 15 minutes). Any proposal found not to do this will be disregarded and considered invalid, even if it achieves sufficient votes.\n\nItem 7:\n\nWe propose that in the event of conflicting approved proposals, priority will be given to the proposal that was approved most recently. \n",

      "content": "YamV2 can act as the governance token and for this to gain value overtime and people holding it as an asset, we need to reduce the supply. It can be done by denominating in the ratio of 1:10\n\nExample, the total supply can be reduced 10 times, and each of them holding the token will be reduced 10 times but the value will be the same. If I have 10 tokens worth $10, I can have the same value with 1 token.\n\nIn this way, it will meet more demand, supporting the protocol as whole. We have a huge community and as investors we would like to see YamV2 gaining value upon adoption.",
