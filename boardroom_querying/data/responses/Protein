      "title": "Season 5 Proposal: A Collaborative Report Framework",
      "content": "Authors: Andrea, Roisin, Deniz\n\nThis proposal aims to ratify Protein Community’s focus and budget allocation for Season 5, from January to April 2023, setting the wheels in motion for the next phase of Protein Community as a collaborative knowledge network.\n\nThis proposal is the product of many community conversations throughout Season 4 reflecting on the value of Protein Community as a standalone initiative as well as our position within the larger Protein ecosystem.\n\n## Season 5 Focus: Defining a Collaborative Report Framework\n\nIn Season 5, we will focus the community around the creation of an insight report, made in collaboration with Protein Agency. As these reports are normally created in-house by the Agency team, this is a first for Protein and a chance to trial an experimental new way of working and collaborating.\n\nWith this new direction comes a new definition of who we are:\n>Protein Community is a tokenized community of future-focused, culture-makers seeking to define new ways to come together to create a collaborative knowledge network.\n\n### Season 5 Approach: A Shared Goal\n\nWe want our projects to be impactful and generate meaningful results. We want to create a platform that offers a rewarding experience for the members of the community and, at the same time, generates value for the wider ecosystem.\nIn order to achieve this, we aim to create opportunities to begin building a collective body of work that can generate value for our community. \n\nTo reach this, we propose:\n- A seasonal input (a theme) that will influence all of Protein Community’s initiatives for that season.\n- A seasonal output (a collective report) that is co-created by our community members and ecosystem.\n\nVoted in by our community in Season 4, the theme of the report will centre around “Community” — a Dirty Word that has been co-opted and overused to the point where some believe it has lost true meaning.\n\n### Season 5 Approach: Collaborative Creation, Research in the Open\n\nOur aim is to further decentralise the curation and production of our content and events to the community by creating opportunities to respond to briefs and pitch ideas. We will also challenge our existing methodologies to surface ideas and hone new forms of reporting and expression with all research conducted “in the open” via our existing mediums: \n\n- Protein Feed for daily discoveries and desk research\n- Protein Supplement for surfacing the most relevant topics\n- Stories of Growth podcast for expert interviews\n- Protein Forums for panel discussions and roundtables\n- Protein Socials for panels, quantitative polls and qualitative feedback\n- Members Workshops (online or IRL at Protein Studios) for deeper analysis and collective creation\n- Protein Discord for coordination, updates, and vibes ✨\n\n### Season 5: How We Work\n\nAll members will have a chance to contribute to the report by:\n\n1  - Applying for bounties set by the Editorial team\n2 - Pitching ideas to the Editorial team\n3 -  Participating in one of the Chapters\n\n#### Emergent Report Creation\nWe believe that cultural insights and behaviours can be better captured, decoded, and narrated by a distributed network of contributors.\n\nThis process is an experiment, something that we invite you all to be part of, ensuring that we will do our best to facilitate the conditions to:\n- Generate new forms of creation and coordination\n- Facilitate the forging of new relationships among our members\n- Provide the room and the conditions for unexpected ideas to emerge\n- Redistribute part of the value generated by this initiative among its contributors and part of it to our treasury ensuring that this type of projects can make us sustainable over time\n\n###### Seasonal Budget\nThe report will be assigned 100.000 $PRTN that will be distributed among the report contributors according to their contribution\n\n###### Proposal details\nVoting starts on the 6th of January and closes on the 10th\nTo pass, this proposal must be approved by 50% of the voting Members\n\n",

      "title": "Season 4 Proposal: Our very own merge",
      "content": "This formal proposal aims to solidify Protein Community’s focus and budget for Season 4, spanning from 26th September to 21st December. The original invitation proposal was shared by Will on our Forum (see the link below).\n\nThis version of the proposal is based on the immensely valuable feedback that we received from you throughout our S3 → S4 intermission via a survey, two community calls, a workshop, and forum discussion. We also tried to incorporate feedback from investors and other parts of the Protein ecosystem.\n\n## Season 4 theme\nIn Season 3 we tried to work on three objectives and had five teams to do that. In Season 4 we want to simultaneously FOCUS more on one goal, but also make it feel less as working for a COMPANY. So instead of teams we are introducing a more flexible structure with roles, projects and grants committee (addressed in [PIP18: Org Structure v1.1 proposal](https://forum.protein.xyz/t/pip-18-org-structure-v1-1-revised/149)), and propose this as a uniting theme for the season:\n\n### Develop connections and relationships across the Protein ecosystem, creating new utility for $PRTN with existing assets.\n\nWe believe this way it will be easier to achieve value for the $PRTN token: \n\n \n![Protein_Ecosystem.001 cropped.jpeg](ipfs://bafkreiatlbvpk6w4aoafzfemme4uzfjq7f6fxac6cfjlh74vukzpknh26y)\n    \n\nIn Season 4 we invite you to experiment with tangible integrations across the Protein ecosystem (Studios, Agency, Holdings) as well as focus on value alignment. This should bring exciting opportunities for community members:\n* Participate in vision workshops alongside Agency and Studios teams\n* Experiment with integrating Good Growth into existing Agency offerings\n* How to make the Community, Agency, and Agency subDAO work better together\n* Shared learning sessions i.e. Community running *WTF is Web3?* sessions for the Agency team and Agency team running similar sessions for the Community\n* Revisit our $PRTN tokenomics to uncover new utility and ensure it’s delivering maximum to value to our hodlers\n* Extend perks (discounts) that Studios members currently get to all community members and vice versa\n* Use Studios desk and event spaces to host events in support of Community projects and initiatives (e.g. GG roundtables)\n\nAlongside various initiatives such as these, this will move us towards the goal of creating an integrated Protein Ecosystem with Good Growth sitting at the centre, and increase the value of the $PRTN token.\n\nWe are still open to members suggesting and working on their own initiatives / products (on the understanding that the treasury has an abundance of $PRTN, but very limited amount of $USDC, which was previously spent on compensation of team leads / core team – this will be revised in S4).\n\n## Budgeting\n$USDC: Max of 60,000 $USDC\n$PRTN: Max of 500,000 $PRTN (0.05% of supply)\n\nWith the updated compensation framework (see [PIP18: Org Structure v1.1 proposal](https://forum.protein.xyz/t/pip-18-org-structure-v1-1-revised/149)), we aim to improve contributors’ experience by making it more flexible in terms of getting rewarded for your work. In Season 4 we’re getting rid of teams and instead invite you to either complete bounties, nominate yourself for one of the roles (within Protein project or community project) or request funding for your own projects from the grants committee. The new processes will be described in more detail on our forum and our Notion, and the core team will facilitate budgeting and scoping at the beginning of S4.\n\n## Benefits:\n* It builds on the origins of Protein Community, brings community members the opportunity to bring their talents to well-remunerated branding projects - that are already part of a B-Corp agency.\n* It would allow for a continued way for GG to influence the activities of real world organisations in the Protein Ecosystem.\n* Leveraging existing assets should increase investor interest.\n\n## Concerns:\n* For successful integration, we'll have to find alignment between $PRTN holders and external stakeholders.\n* Feels like a big change in direction, after we spent the first three seasons on Good Growth, and not all members might be interested in working with brands, etc.\n\n\nWith our [Ownership report](https://twitter.com/protein/status/1523948357911289858) around the corner, we have an opportunity to put some of these findings into practice and pioneer a model that is adaptive, positive, and equitable for a world that is increasingly uncertain, polarising, and reinforcing unequal distributions.\n\nAs we look to positively contribute to the transition to a [Good Growth](https://proteincommunity.notion.site/What-is-Good-Growth-331733daa73f4962a37759c97b9fb24b) world, we know we can do more by focusing not only on our internal processes, but also on our external impact, and using our brand as a platform for good. I know that this may represent a departure from what some of you expected when you joined, but I feel that bringing together these various sources of value - and values - presents the best opportunity for creating meaningful impact in the world and value for all of us.\n\n## Proposal details:\n* Voting starts Wednesday 21.09 at 4pm and closes on Sunday 25.09 at 11pm\n* It’s a high-impact decision, so a quorum requires the participation of at least 50 community Members\n* To pass, this proposal must be approved by 75% of the voting Members\n* Org re-design proposal will be submitted early next week and it will lay out HOW we deliver on the strategic objectives mentioned above - we believe it is important to vote on it separately\n* If the re-design proposal is approved, the seasonal budget will need to be distributed between core team, projects and bounties ASAP, and grants committee will have to start functioning before 30th September\n",

      "content": "This proposal aims to solidify Protein Community’s objectives and budget for Season 3, spanning from 1st June – 31st August. The original proposal was shared in our Forum and has been co-created with key community voices - thank you all.\n\n## Reflection & Direction\nProtein Community set out to embed something we call Good Growth into web3. This is a true north goal for us. We want the next 1,000,000 web3 dwellers to know what’s good for them, for our society and our planet.\n\nIn Preseason and Season 1, we brought together the biggest brains and hearts we knew to define a new version of growth that works for people and planet. In Season 2, our Community ran its first Recelerator program, supporting 3 Member Projects with experts from across web3 and $50,000 total grants. \n\nAfter significant reflection, brainstorming and deliberation, it’s clear our desire is to deepen our understanding and the applications of good growth across the web3 ecosystem. Let's not just ‘define’ a new version of growth, let’s make it real, tangible, embedded. **Good growth is our product.** At the same time we need to take care to avoid becoming bureaucratic, focusing too much on measurements that skew the organic process of doing good growth, and jumping into a space before being clear on the solutions and potential allies out there already.\n\n## Season 3 Objectives\n\n### PRODUCT DISCOVERY\nDevelop good growth into an effective and tangible solution enabling communities to positively impact their ecosystem.\n\n### COMMUNITY HEALTH\nEnergise members and the wider web3 ecosystem to meaningfully contribute to the future of good growth.\n\n### TREASURY HEALTH\nBuild long-term security into the Treasury and $PRTN token to ensure the longevity and sustainability of Protein Community and good growth framework.\n\n## Budgeting\n\n$USDC: Max of 70,000 $USDC\n$PRTN: Max of 500,000 $PRTN (0.05% of supply)\n\nAs part of the Governance Team's new Self-regulation framework, we aim for teams to manage their own budgets this season. As part of Season 3 we’ll be introducing several new ideas and governance initiatives to give contributors and teams more control and autonomy.\n\n## Teams and pods\n\nWithin the teams listed below are also several smaller pods imitated in previous seasons, these will continue into Season 3 - alongside new pods formed by our members. See below how key teams are going to address the aforementioned objectives.\n\nWe’re planning to launch a few pods within each of those teams and we hope that the new Self-regulation framework will empower members to form new pods if they feel necessary.\n\n## Timeline\n\n- Snapshot vote starts 27th May, 11am UTC \n- Snapshot vote ends 31st May, 7pm UTC\n\n![Protein_OKRs_-_Frame_1.jpg](ipfs://QmS46T1mppDx6XmtYSyxv2EAbRYSt2XgrEUF4v2yxU2oYr)",

Various ways of supporting artists including digital and physical exhibition spaces with guaranteed sales floor for artists, residencies, classes to help artists establish a platform, and care infrastructure such as UBI and mutual aid funds. Built by @lomedia\n\n### Wonderseed \nNon-profit organisation that works with vulnerable and at-risk young people in 3 cities in the US - many of them are former gang members - to improve their life outcomes through improving emotional intelligence with immersive experiences. They will work with young people to deliver web3 curriculum and “playbook” for how non-profits can adopt web3. Built by @iamkhayyam\n\n### Zouzoukwa\nAfrica-centric emoji set to be turned into NFTs to fundraise for further onboarding of web3 users in the Ivory Coast and expansion into other African countries. A platform to allow African creators to raise funds through contributing to the ongoing expansion of the emoji set. Built by @OPlerou\n\n## Funding\n\nFor Season 2 GG projects we can allocate a total of $50,000 in $PRTN and $50,000 USDC. The $PRTN will be used internally to reward PRTN members (e.g. for completing bounties). That should enable the selected projects to achieve significant progress in 6 weeks. \n\n## Voting timeline\n- Community Snapshot goes live 25th Feb at 4pm UTC\n- Community Snapshot ends 28th Feb at 4pm UTC\n- Town Hall Presentation on 28th Feb at 5pm UTC",

      "title": "Bring the Protein Journal back for Web3",
      "content": "# Purpose\n\nThe Protein Journal was a much-loved printed newspaper (v1) and magazine (v2) that was first published (unironically) to celebrate the launch of the iPad in April 2010. With Protein’s entry into Web3, it feels like a good opportunity to revisit and refresh the Protein Journal brand for the next generation. You can find/read the entire archive [here](https://issuu.com/proteinjournal/docs/protein__journal__1).\n\nFor context, the current series of [Protein Reports](https://www.proteinagency.com/reports) began life within the pages of the Protein Journal, but are now very much a product of [Protein Agency](https://www.proteinagency.com/), our sister brand consultancy. So as to avoid any confusion, the intention would be to keep the focus of the Protein Journal 3.0 closer to the [Protein Supplement](https://protein.substack.com/), i.e. the intersection of culture and tech, but with a Good Growth lens.\n\n# Specifics\n\nThe idea is to assemble a small editorial and design team to concept and define what and how a Protein Journal 3.0 would look and feel like and where it would live. Based on these outcomes, a final budget would be agreed, calls for submissions released and commissioning started.\n\n# Funding\n\nTBC, but no more than $5,000 USDC/PRTN\n\n# Benefits\n\n- (Re)establishes Protein as a cultural thought leader\n- Provides PRTN members opportunities to earn / write / be awesome\n- Builds Protein brand awareness / love / vibes\n\n\"A good way to showcase all the Protein work, with a side of potentially helping projects who receive a grant to attract and bring on new community members and specifically fill holes in their team knowledge or skillsets.\"\n\n\"I can see how it can follow along the different chapters of our journey and become a whole body of work.\"\n\n\"This would be a great way to re-market out Content Hub on Notion. “Community spotlight” can also be under the umbrella of this journal. I was approached by some members who want to write a piece for us but the uncertainty of the budget was a blocker.\"\n\n\"I love this, especially as a seasonal release which reflects our focuses. You can imagine this being such an amazing archive, with guest editors every season. I also love things like ‘positive news’ which is a celebration of good growth, think a section on that could work for sure\"\n\n# Good Growth\n\n- Showcase Good Growth projects supported by PRTN\n- Profile PRTN community members\n- Preach the Good Growth gospel\n- Help GG projects with new members and funding\n\n# Concerns\n\nAdditional load on the core team\n\n## Proposal Timeline\n\nSnapshot Vote starts 15th Feb 2pm UTC\nSnapshot Vote ends 18th Feb 7pm UTC ",

      "title": "Bridge to Polygon to Minimize Operational Costs",
      "content": "\n# Purpose\n\nWe want to reduce the operational costs of distributing $PRTN and other assets (ETH/USDC). As we continue to pay core team / contributors and issue grants, we want to minimize operational costs while maximising the potential of our assets. So we propose to bridge 5% of $PRTN and 20% of the Treasury to Layer2, leaving the majority for security reasons on ETH mainnet.\n\n- Primary purpose is to reduce gas transaction costs. Gas is prohibitive for maximising the $PRTN value for the community and contributors.\n- We’re seeing more and more communities create layer2 solutions to their smaller operational transactions, and more products being built with this in mind.\n- Creating liquidity on just mainnet is important to work against price volatility and for security reasons\n\nSome context / definitions first:\n### Blockchain Bridge\nA blockchain bridge is a connection that allows the transfer of tokens and/or arbitrary data from one chain to another. Both chains can have different protocols, rules and governance models, but the bridge provides a compatible way to interoperate securely on both sides.\n\n### Ethereum Mainnet\nMainnet is the term used to describe when a blockchain protocol is fully developed and deployed, meaning that cryptocurrency transactions are being broadcasted, verified, and recorded on a distributed ledger technology (blockchain).\n\n### Gas Costs\nGas refers to the fee, or pricing value, required to successfully conduct a transaction or execute a contract on the Ethereum protocol.\n\n# Specifics\n\nWe will bridge 5,000,000 $PRTN (5% of total supply) and $50,000 USDC (20% of $250,000 current treasury) to a polygon gnosis safe as a child of the Protein safe.\n\nWe will use Coinvise to import the $PRTN tokens, and then bridge the % across to polygon. \n\nWe then use this, integrated with apps ‘superfluid’ and ‘CSV airdrops’ for our transactions to send PRTN (on polygon), ETH and USDC (PoS) to members.\n\nWe’ll be able to do this more regularly and aligned with our earn to access models. Receivers get their assets on the MATIC network, which they can bridge back to mainnet if they need to.\n\nWe propose that liquidity pools will be set up on ETH mainnet, Snapshot and guild can be used with both polygon and ETH integrations.\n\n# Benefits\n\n- Members can get instantly airdropped their compensation for contributors without incurring gas fees.\n- Core team can use superfluid (operating on polygon to stream assets)\n- Transferring assets is cheaper\n\n# Concerns\n\n- Splitting the $PRTN token between ETH mainnet and Polygon could cause confusion as the $PRTN token grows\nAnswer: We’ve been advised through other community case studies that this isn’t an issue\n\n- Members having to ‘bridge’ the $PRTN back could cause confusion\nAnswer: We’ll create comprehensive education around this process\n\n- Creating liquidity on just mainnet means members have to pay gas to bridge back the tokens to mainnet and also pay gas to list them. This could cause a lack of incentive for contributions and frustration.\nAnswer: In reality this will encourage members to be more thoughtful about holding their $PRTN/continuing to build the ecosystem\n\nQ: Is this also a proposal for liquidity pools on mainchain? Or just for bridging a portion of $PRTN and USDC?\nA: It will cover both eventually, but we need to start with a more effective way of distributing PRTN as part of our “earn to access” initiative\n\nQ: Why not move it all to polygon / give everyone their current tokens on poly and ditch the old? Is it because the liquidity pools need to be on mainnnet?\nA: At this stage it’s essentially a test to make sure the transition will work for the community before we bridge the full amount. We’ve thought about it for sure, and also about minting an entirely new token on polygon. For now, it makes the most sense to bridge a smaller amount which will allow us to create even more collaboration and ownership, on a chain which is still compatible with ETH mainnet in the long term.\n\n# Good Growth\n\n- Bridging tokens is key to good growth because it allows the Protein Community to distribute tokens faster and more efficiently, creating a more diverse token economy and base\n- Moving from ETH will make our infrastructure more energy efficient and sustainable \n\n## Proposal Timeline\n\nCommunity Snapshot starts Feb 7th 9am UTC\nCommunity Snapshot ends Feb 10th 4pm UTC\nMigration begins Feb 11th",

      "content": "# Purpose\n\nIn Season 2, we’re going to be piloting a number of “mission aligned” Good Growth projects in order to make our “helping people and ideas grow” mission tangible as well as providing relevant opportunities for our members to contribute and earn. This proposal provides a number of benefits to PRTN, whilst also helping “good brands” get closer to their goals.\n\n# Specifics\n\nThe idea is to partner with [Known Source](https://www.knownsource.co.uk/), a UK based startup on a mission to “Build the marketplace for first class second hand fashion”. Unlike [Depop](https://www.depop.com/) or similar reseller marketplaces, their point of difference is they guarantee to buy back on any item purchased at any point in the future.\n\nThe proposed project is a £25k launch campaign with the opportunity for other PRTN members to join the project team - specifically a project manager and a creative. These would be paid contributions in either fiat, stable coin and $PRTN based on agreed day and/or project rates. This opportunity originally came via [Protein Agency](https://www.proteinagency.com/), our web2 brand consultancy.\n\n### The proposed financial split is a follows\n\n- 10% to PRTN Treasury (£2.5k)\n- 10% to PRTN Good Growth Grant Fund (£2.5k)\n- 80% to be split between the project team (£20k)\n\nIf successful, this model will be a central component to how PRTN grows, as it will provide a regular, stable and scalable revenues into PRTN from real-world / web2 organisations that aren’t affected by crypto price fluctuations.\n\n# Funding\n\nNone. This would be revenue generating for both the PRTN Treasury as well as PRTN members\n\n# Benefits\n\n1. Provides funds for our Good Growth Grant fund without diversifying the treasury aka selling $PRTN tokens to investors\n2. Provides earning opportunities for PRTN members to contribute to Good Growth approved brand projects\n3. Provides regular, stable and scalable revenues into PRTN from real-world/web2 organisations that aren’t affected by crypto price fluctuations\n4. Provides relevant brands the opportunity to work with PRTN members in the knowledge they are also contributing to the Good Growth Grant Fund\n5. Leverages our relationship with Protein Agency for future Good Growth projects\n\n# Concerns\n\nThere’s a potential conflict with Protein Agency, in terms of which projects go where, but this could be easily rectified by a) filtering for Good Growth, b) size of budget, as Protein Agency doesn’t usually take on projects that are under £50k.\n\n## Proposal Timeline\n\nCommunity Snapshot starts Feb 7th 4pm UTC\nCommunity Snapshot ends Feb 9th 7pm UTC",

      "content": "Before entering Season 2, we want to ensure that the PRTN community is aligned in terms of the Good Growth theme that we’re going to invest our resources in next season. In many ways this is a pilot for us, so we want to be focused to increase our chances for success. That said, we have quite a few amazing applications within each theme, so any potential contributor will be able to find something that resonates with them. \n\n### Voting is a bit different this time, as we're asking you to rank in order of importance the missions that you identify with the most (instead of choosing only one option).\n\nDon’t worry, if your chosen mission isn’t selected, we will be voting on a new mission every season, whilst continuing to support any previously selected missions. \n\nCheck out this [Miro board](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVORsNkEc=/) to find out more about all the projects\n\n## MISSION 1. Bringing personal and social wellbeing to web3\nProjects in this cluster centre on nurturing the body mind and spirit of people. They range from changing the underlying way time is processed by apps and IRL products, to events that bring human connection either through online meditation or IRL sharing vulnerability.\n\n## MISSION 2. Using web3 tools to reverse patterns of environmental destruction\nProjects in this cluster use the new tools at our disposal to organize, incentivize and fundraise for activities that decrease human impact in the world through changing the paradigm on how we view the natural world, using funds to hold companies to account and engaging our collective curiosity to fund research and conservation.\n\n## MISSION 3. Making the web3 ecosystem easier to navigate\nThese projects have realized that the process of getting into and making the most of web3 needs to be made more accessible and easy to navigate. Whether it be a web3 NFT textbook, immersive educational experiences, a listing and ranking of DAOs to work with, or connecting with the all-important developer community.\n\n## MISSION 4. Supporting new business models\nThese projects are really interested in promoting and tooling people and projects for new business models paradigms that web3 creates affordances for. They support the new job roles for creativity, and the development of business incubators for students away from the VC paradigm.\n\n## MISSION 5. Building web3 infrastructure for greater equity and sovereignty\nThese projects have designed new methods of fundraising and distribution of legacy cultural systems to bring greater equity and sovereignty to their users: members of cultural and knowledge creatives, as well as more generally creating a “union” for decentralized workers.\n\n## MISSION 6. Bringing underrepresented groups into the new economy\nProjects in this cluster are using web3 tools engage with communities that the system neglected, or making it easier for communities from beyond the anglosphere to benefit from the tools and technologies of web3. There are various BIPOC creator communities, organizations working with youth from underserved groups, and projects looking to either showcase and promote diverse cultures, provide translation services for them, or connect them to share strategies to sustainably manage their heritage sites.\n\n## Voting timeline\n- Community Snapshot goes live Feb 2 at 7pm\n- Community Snapshot closes Feb 4 at 12pm\n\nYou can find more details in this [document](https://proteincommunity.notion.site/PRTN-Season-2-Pilot-Projects-Mission-Selection-0a88c433475142ecb98e8f2f8bdf29f7)\n\nCheck out this [Miro board](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVORsNkEc=/) to find out more about all the projects\n\n### Voting is a bit different this time, as we're asking you to rank in order of importance the missions that you identify with the most (instead of choosing only one option).",

In addition, it will mean that the Protein Community will become financially independent from the Protein Mothership, giving full autonomy to our members as well as an important first step on our journey of progressive decentralisation.\n\n#### Funding:\n\nIn this seed round, we are proposing to do a small treasury diversification to a maximum of $250,000 or 5% of total $PRTN supply at a total valuation of $5m.\n\nListed investors will delegate their votes in line with how the community votes e.g. if 80% vote yes and 20% vote no, then investor tokens will be voted with a 80-yes 20-no weighting.\n\n\n---\n\n#### Proposal Timeline:\n\n06.12.21 - Proposal shared with community\n07.12.21 - Proposal feedback\n08.12.21 - Proposal Snapshot opens at 12pm UTC (midday)\n10.12.21 - Proposal Snapshot closes at 12pm UTC (midday)\n10.12.21 - Mirror announcement at 2pm UTC\n",

      "title": "Protein Community Season 1 Proposal",
      "content": "## Summary\n\nThe aim of this proposal is to get our community’s consensus and support on the top level goals, timeline and operational structure of our Season 1. If our Pre-season was laying the foundations, Season 1 is building the house. Over the next few months, we will establish our position within the Web3 landscape as an incubator of ideas that reflect our Good Growth mission by offering education, expertise and funding. \n\nSeason 1 will start on 1st November 2021 and run for a period of 60 days. Voting will take place through Snapshot using $PRTN and voting will start on the 22nd of October and close on the 25th. All founding members have 20,000 $PRTN to cast their vote. The team has shared this document with the community prior to the vote.\n\n*Below is a slightly stripped back version of the Proposal, [see the full proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xBYliPgn1D3fSgSqc7DNivGCWEAtHzCpqoA-OTSQOo0/edit#heading=h.r6f59pxnh2sd)*\n\n---\n### Goals\n\n#### 1.

This proposal will be shared with the Community and led by the core, governance and treasury teams.\n\n---\n\n### Season 1 Roadmap\n\nNOVEMBER\n \n1st - Season 1 Starts 🚀\n- Open the community up for wider onboarding / Establish membership processes\n- NFT raise\n- Establish Good Growth Framework\n- Establish working groups; with $PRTN token allocations for contributions\n- Start to create good growth directory\n- Launch education and accessibility initiatives\n- Community Brand Refresh\n\nDECEMBER\n\n- Fund and incubate our first collective project\n- Launch our Good Growth framework for others to use\n- Create and launch our open source good growth directory\n- Strategic fundraise for expanding the Protein Community ecosystem\n\n---\n\n### About Protein Community\n\nLearn about Protein’s Mission, the $PRTN token, the wider ecosystem, Core Team members and [more](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1b8YQMgR902_ndJcTnN7YKMM8LGFya_1a7xgXAIMqwf8/edit#heading=h.t7fckucndmt6)\n\n### Next Steps\n\nVote below to pass the Season 1 proposal and it will begin on the 1st November, thank you to everyone who has been part of the journey so far, and we can't wait to continue it with you!\n\n### Decision",
