      "content": "## Summary:\n\nThis proposal seeks to allocate 40M DODO tokens to engage professional market makers. The goal is to improve DODO's liquidity and market depth across major exchanges.\n\n## Motivation:\n\nDODO is currently listed on exchanges like Binance, Gate, and Kucoin. While the project is progressing well, there is potential to further enhance DODO's liquidity. Adequate liquidity is essential for reducing price volatility, lowering transaction costs, and attracting more investors.\n\nWe propose to allocate 4%, equivalent to 40M DODO tokens, from the community-allocated reserves. These tokens will be distributed to our partnered market makers, who will provide liquidity services on the exchanges where DODO is listed.\n\nThis proposal aims to significantly increase DODO's average daily trading volume, reduce bid-ask spreads, and improve trading efficiency. These improvements will not only mitigate the price impact of large trades and stabilize the market but also enhance DODO's visibility on mainstream exchanges, attracting more institutional and retail investors.\n\n## Conclusion:\n\nBy allocating 40M DODO tokens to professional market makers, we expect to significantly boost DODO's average daily trading volume and market performance, reduce bid-ask spreads, and create long-term value for all token holders.",

These tokens aim to attract more users to DODO as an aggregator and boost protocol revenue.\n\n## **Motivation**\n\nDODO has been deployed on 15 public chains to date. However, deployment alone is insufficient to capture potential users and their trading volume. To better harness the value within these networks’ ecosystems, we propose migrating tokens and launching incentive campaigns.\n\nAmong Layer 2 solutions, Base distinguishes itself with EVM compatibility, low gas fees, scalability, and integration with the Coinbase ecosystem. The Total Value Locked (TVL) on the Base Mainnet has surpassed $1.6 billion, with daily trading volumes exceeding $600 million.\n\nIntegrating DODO into the Base ecosystem will allow users to benefit from DODO’s innovative Proactive Market Maker (PMM), offering highly capital-efficient liquidity pools, SmartTrade, and other features.\n\nToken incentives effectively attract liquidity providers (LPs) and boost trading volumes for protocols in the growth phase. Providing DODO tokens as incentives on Base would significantly increase the number of DODO token holders, fostering substantial growth for the DODO community.\n\n## **Summary**\n\nIf DIP-21 is approved, the DODO protocol will migrate 20 million DODO tokens to the Base Mainnet and launch a new trading campaign with DODO rewards.",

      "content": "### **Summary**\n\nIn response to the recent surge in BTC Layer 2 activities, BTC staking protocols, and other BTCfi initiatives, the DODO team proposes the allocation and migration of 10M DODO tokens to incentivize BTC trading pairs across multiple chains, including Ethereum, Arbitrum, BNB Chain and Mantle, etc. This initiative aims to leverage DODO's innovative Pegged Asset Pool to enhance liquidity, attract significant trading volume, and generate revenues that can compensate for the incentives provided. Additionally, this strategy supports DODOchain's role as a liquidity settlement layer, facilitating future BTC trading and generating more value for DODO holders.\n\n### **Motivation**\n\n1. **Booming BTC Layer 2s, Staking Protocols, and BTCfi Activities:** The rapid growth in BTC Layer 2 solutions, BTC staking protocols, and other BTCfi activities has created a heightened demand for BTC trading pairs. Incentivizing these pairs can significantly boost liquidity and attract users involved in these emerging sectors.\n2. **Capital Efficiency of Pegged Asset Pool:** DODO's innovative Pegged Asset Pool offers excellent capital efficiency, which can attract a substantial amount of trading volume. The success of DODO's stablecoin volume demonstrates the potential for generating significant revenues to offset the incentives.\n3. **Future Value for DODOchain:** By connecting BTC Layer 2s and establishing a liquidity settlement layer, DODOchain can facilitate seamless BTC trading. Increasing TVL on various chains will significantly enhance future BTC trading on DODOchain, generating more value for DODO holders.\n\n### **Rules**\n\n1. **Allocate 10M DODO Tokens:** Allocate and migrate 10M DODO tokens to incentivize BTC trading pairs on Ethereum, Arbitrum, BNB Chain, and Mantle, etc.\n2. **Establish Incentive Programs:** Develop and implement tailored incentive programs for each chain to maximize user engagement and liquidity growth.\n3. **Monitor and Adjust:** Continuously monitor the performance of these incentive programs and make necessary adjustments to ensure optimal results.\n\nThrough these initiatives, we aim to position DODO as a leading platform for BTC assets, thereby capturing more value and offering enhanced benefits to our users and token holders.",

      "title": "DIP-19: Migration of DODO Liquidity Pool on Ethereum to DODOchain",
      "content": "## Summary\n\nFollowing the launch of the DODOchain mainnet, DODO DEX will leverage DODOchain and DODO Trade Hub to evolve into an Omni Trading DEX. To facilitate this growth and meet the demand for exchanging DODO tokens with multi-chain assets, we propose to close the DODO liquidity pool on Ethereum and migrate it entirely to DODOchain. This migration will enable users to contribute liquidity to the DODO pool on DODOchain and earn token incentives as liquidity providers.\n\n## Motivation\n\nDODO DEX currently boasts a trading volume exceeding $143 billion and a user base of over 3.4 million. The deployment of DODO DEX on the DODOchain mainnet will introduce liquidity incentives aimed at increasing the Total Value Locked (TVL) and expanding our user community. Our goal is to attract TVL and users from DODO DEX across various chains to DODOchain by offering incentives and other benefits, thereby stimulating its growth. Ensuring sufficient liquidity for trading post-migration, especially after the allocation of DODO token incentives, is essential.\n\nThe primary liquidity pool for DODO tokens on the Ethereum network is the [DODO-USDT pool](https://app.dodoex.io/pool/0x8876819535b48b551c9e97ebc07332c7482b4b2d?network=mainnet), established on September 29, 2020. It has generated over $600 million in trading volume and accrued more than $1.91 million in fees. Managed by a DODO team's multi-signature address, this pool will be transferred to DODOchain upon approval of this proposal and the subsequent launch of DODOchain.\n\nThe migration of the DODO liquidity pool from Ethereum to DODOchain offers several advantages:\n\n- Meets the exchange needs of DODO holders on DODOchain.\n- Facilitates the exchange of DODO tokens with assets across multiple chains, such as the direct trades of DODO for BTC ecosystem assets.\n- Provides liquidity providers the opportunity to earn additional token incentives and capture increased fee income.\n- Potentially increases DODO holders’ share of platform fee revenue (contingent upon future governance votes and the adoption of a new tokenomics and fee distribution mechanism within DODO DEX).\n\n## Rules\n\nWe recommend migrating the DODO liquidity pool from Ethereum to DODOchain to better serve the trading needs of DODO holders on DODOchain, enhance the ability to trade DODO tokens with multi-chain assets, and increase income opportunities for DODO liquidity providers and holders.",

      "content": "## Summary\n\nDODO is launching [DODOchain](https://x.com/DODO_Chain/status/1782431708752859395), an Omni-Trading Layer3 powered by Arbitrum Orbit. As the rollup-level liquidity layer, DODOchain unifies liquidity from various chains into one platform. It supports swaps and cross-chain transactions, streamlining the integration and movement of assets in the Omni-chain era.\n\nWith the rollout of DODOchain, the DODO team plans to deploy DODO DEX on DODOchain as an Omni-Trading DEX supporting multi-chain interoperability. To boost TVL and user growth for DODO DEX, and to attract future partners and support ecosystem development, the DODO team proposes migrating 200M DODO tokens to DODOchain. Furthermore, it is proposed that future protocol revenues of DODO DEX will no longer be used for buybacks and distributions, but instead directed entirely to the DODO community treasury until new tokenomics are launched, at which point their allocation will be determined through governance and voting.\n\n## **Motivation**\n\nFounded in August 2020, the DODO team has been committed to developing products aimed at providing users with the ultimate liquidity solutions and optimal trading price experiences. Currently deployed on 14 mainnets, DODO has facilitated over $134 billion in total trading volume, with more than 22 million transactions and 2.8 million users. Check out all of DODO's data [here](https://info.dodoex.io/overview).\n\nTo continue providing enhanced liquidity solutions and serve the increasingly multi-chain user base, DODO is launching the Omni-Trading Layer3 powered by Arbitrum Orbit, and deploying DODO DEX on DODOchain as an Omni-Trading DEX. This will allow users to exchange assets between different chains, whether EVM-compatible or non-EVM-compatible, with simple operations.\n\nAs DODO DEX is set to be deployed on DODOchain, it is essential to incentivize growth in TVL and user base, attract future partners, and support ecosystem development. Therefore, we propose migrating 200M DODO tokens to DODOchain to achieve these objectives, and suggest that future protocol revenues of DODO DEX be transferred entirely to the DODO community treasury until the launch of new tokenomics, at which point their allocation will be determined through governance and voting.\n\nThrough these initiatives, DODO DEX will be able to capture more value, and DODO tokens will have expanded use cases, bringing additional benefits to DODO holders.\n\n## Rules\n\n1. Propose to migrate 200M DODO tokens to DODOchain, to support the growth of DODO DEX TVL and user base, and to attract future partners and ecosystem development.\n2.

This campaign is about to come to an end. The campaign achieved more than $67 million daily average trading volume, more than $30 million average TVL, and more than 110k unique traders on Polygon during the campaign.\n\nBy participating in Polygon’s Liquidity Mining (LM) 2.0 campaign, DODO is able to get MATIC rewards from the Polygon network (estimated 50k MATIC per month). We propose to match these rewards with our DODO rewards, and to launch a new liquidity mining campaign for next few months until the end of the LM 2.0 campaign. To do so, we will need another 1.5 million DODO tokens to be migrated to Polygon network.\n\n## Summary\nIf DIP-14 is passed, the DODO protocol will end ongoing mining campaign on Polygon, migrate 1.5 million DODO tokens to the Polygon mainnet, and launch a new joint mining campaign with DODO and MATIC rewards.",

      "title": "DIP-13: Governance Framework Update",
      "content": "@radarbear\n\nFor a long time, DODO has used Snapshot for our DIP voting, but there were two issues that remained unsolved:\n\n- Multi-chain voting rights\n- Low voter turnout\n\n## Multi-chain Voting Rights\n\nDODO has achieved excellent results on multiple chains. Detailed data can be viewed here [DODO stats on each chain](https://dodotopia.notion.site/DODO-stats-on-each-chain-a2ac7e136b0e4d30ad4a6a291b26b537)\n\nIn principle, DODO tokens held on any chain give the holder the same voting power with no difference between different chains. In fact, only the DODO tokens on Ethereum have any governance power at all - there is no voting power provided by DODO tokens on all the other chains, which is against the original intention of our multi-chain strategy.\n\nWe therefore propose to move away from using Snapshot, and develop our own voting system instead.\n\nThe new system will be similar to snapshot, and will use off-chain signature collection to count votes. The number of DODO tokens on each chain can be counted in the vote with only one signature. This system will also publish all signatures to AR (a decentralized storage system) for everyone to verify.\n\nWith regards to the vDODO reward emission, we want to have the same yield rate for vDODO tokens on different chains, which is hard to do since the chains can’t communicate with each other. We propose to maintain the current emission of 80,000 DODO tokens per day (29.2 million per year), calculating a fixed yield rate once every to-be-determined period of time, based on the average total lock-in on all chains, and keeping the initial fixed rate consistent with the old vDODO system to ensure a smooth migration. If we were to migrate now, the fixed yield rate would be approximately 55% annualized, or 0.15% daily.\n\nFor example, let’s say that there were 60 million DODO staked initially, so the initial fixed rate would be 55%. In the second month, the staked DODO amount grows to 100 million DODO, we recalculate the fixed rate to 29.2%.\n\nWith regards to the vDODO exit fee, we propose to have a variable fee depends on the yield rate - i.e. If the yield rate drops, the exit fee will decrease accordingly.\n\nIf this DIP passes, the parameters of new vDODO emission model will be voted on in another proposal.\n\nRegarding centralization, if we want to support multiple chains, we are bound to have centralized information transfer. We will make the process as open and transparent as possible - for example, we’ll let Chainlink supply the total amount staked on each chain to determine the yield rate.\n\n## Low Voter Turnout\n\nCreating value through governance requires not only the right to vote on DIPs, but also an investment of time and thoughtful research from each voter. Many cryptocurrency users have the right to vote but lack the time and energy to meaningfully participate in governance. This has resulted in a long period of inactive DODO governance, with a large number of tokens not being used efficiently.\n\nThe main value of DODO tokens comes from governance. Governance controls the release of DODO tokens, how the protocol revenue is used, and the use of deposits already in the treasury.\n\nIf we can create enough liquidity for DODO tokens governance, we can solve this problem very well. Under the new governance framework, DODO holders will be able to delegate their voting power to a proxy. As a proxy, you can seek delegation in a variety of ways, for example:\n\n- DeFi Consulting Services can say: I will use these governance powers to improve DODO’s liquidity mining allocation, improve DODO’s TVL at the same cost, and thus positively impact the coin price. Please delegate your votes to me.\n\n- A project owner can say: I will use these governance rights to get my project recommended by the DODO home page and media publicity support, and anyone who delegates their votes to me will receive a portion of my project’s tokens in the future. Please delegate your votes to me.\n\n- The DODO team can say: We are ‘in it for the long haul’, and will pay more attention to the long-term development of DODO rather than short-term interests. We can’t promise any financial gain, but if you trust our founding team, you can delegate your vote to me.\n\nSuch an agency mechanism can:\n\n- Greatly improve governance efficiency and make DODO more decentralized\n- Improve token utilization and help DODO grow better and faster\n- Bring more intuitive and diversified economic benefits for principals\n\nIt is worth mentioning that the DODO token itself is just a typical ERC-20 token, which technically does not have the possibility of delegating the liquidity for governance power. In order to complete the above upgrade, we need to deploy new vDODO contracts and generate vDODO using DODO as collateral. Therefore, we propose that, henceforth, only vDODO tokens will grant voting rights.\n\n## Upgrade approach\n\nIf this DIP passes, we will perform the following actions:\n\n- Develop the new governance system\n- Migrate from the old vDODO contract to a new one\n\nThe current governance procedure would remain unchanged before the migration.\n\nAfter that, all DIPs will be voted using the new system.

Only 3% of DODO holders voted, as holders of DODO tokens that were staked were not allowed to vote and there were several technical issues related to the voting cut-off deadline.\n\n## Reasons \n1. DIP-12 Proposal reduced DODO rewards by 50-70% across various pools and undermines the core purpose of increasing TVL of DODO pools, the fees collected from these pools, and DODO value altogether. There have been outflows since the proposal originated. \n\n2. Holders of staked DODO positions were NOT allowed to vote (SUSHI allows LP Voting). Only a small group of DODO holders voted on the proposal. This violates principals of DAO and undermines the protocol. \n\n3. Less than 3% voted: Only 3M DODO tokens voted toward the proposal out of >100M DODO in total circulation. \n\n\n## Proposal: increase DODO rewards back to original levels\n\nRevert the DIP-12 Proposal and keep the original distribution. \n\nDIP-12:  Adjustment of Liquidity Mining Incentives on Select Pools:\nhttps://snapshot.org/#/dodobird.eth/proposal/0xc8d5d799132260d14ed28ff8b32ce16fdd5deeda2ee3cb79b54e12580c649c8c\n",

      "content": "\n## Motivations\n\nDODO has deployed on 10 different chains, 7 of which have liquidity mining incentives, with a combined TVL of around $300M and a combined daily trading volume of around $200M.\n\nCompared to Uniswap, Curve and other Dex, DODO has a lot potential for TVL growth. Following DODO’s multi-chain deployment strategy, liquidity mining incentives have been rolled out on multiple chains in order to kickstart their liquidity. However, DODO token emission has been increasing following our multi-chain expansion and token migrations. Therefore, the evaluation of the TVL and trading volume growth compared to DODO token emission is very important - the purpose of it being to increase the efficiency of token emission which we believe benefits all DODO stakeholders.\n\n## Specification\n\nIn recent weeks, we have analyzed TVL and trading volumes of all our active liquidity mining pools and compared the cost of renting liquidity with DODO. Based on this research, we propose to adjust the following liquidity mining incentives on multiple chains:\n\n- Ethereum:\n    - WETH-USDC: reduce from 2 DODO/Block to 0.25 DODO/Block\n    - WBTC-USDC: reduce from 2 DODO/Block to 0.5 DODO/Block\n- BNB Chain:\n    - DODO-WBNB: reduce from 0.3 DODO/Block to 0.15 DODO/Block\n- Arbitrum:\n    - WETH-USDC: end all liquidity mining incentives\n    - WBTC-USDC: reduce from 0.5 DODO/Block to 0.2 DODO/Block\n    - DODO-USDC: reduce from 0.3 DODO/Block to 0.15 DODO/Block\n- Aurora:\n    - USDT-USDC: increase from 0.1 DODO/Block to 0.16DODO/Block\n    - DODO-USDC: reduce from 0.1 DODO/Block + 0.007 NEAR/Block to 0.02 DODO/Block + 0.003 NEAR/Block\n    - ETH-WNEAR: new incentive pool with 0.01 DODO/Block + 0.002 Near/Block\n    - USDC-WNEAR: new incentive pool with 0.01 DODO/Block + 0.002 Near/Block\n- Polygon:\n    - USDC-USDT: reduce from 0.44 DODO/Block to 0.3 DODO/Block\n    - DODO-USDT: reduce from 0.11 DODO/Block to 0.05 DODO/Block\n- Moonriver:\n    - USDT-USDC: reduce from 0.0025 WMOVR/Block to 0.0015 WMOVR/Block\n    - DODO-USDC: reduce from 0.0025 WMOVR/Block to 0.0010 WMOVR/Block\n    - WMOVR-USDC: reduce from 0.5 DODO/Block to 0.25 DODO/Block\n    - ETH-WMOVR: reduce from 0.5 DODO/Block to 0.25 DODO/Block\n\nThe detailed pool statistics used in our analysis are attached here: https://dodotopia.notion.site/The-detailed-pool-statistics-3a042996d44d4b6c9a3d3281a07a74c8",

You can check it here: [https://community.dodoex.io/t/vdodo-tokenomics-design-update-proposal/10326](https://community.dodoex.io/t/vdodo-tokenomics-design-update-proposal/10326)\n\n## Summary\n\nThis DIP proposes to end the double reward period for the current emission of vDODO membership rewards. At the same time, we would decrease the vDODO exit fee cap from 15% to 10%. \n\n## Specifications\n\nFor the past year, DODO has provided double rewards for vDODO members. In order to implement the DODO Tokenomics Update plan, we propose to shift the DODO token reward gradually toward the new tokenomics. Governance will become a significant part of the new tokenomic system, so the reward for just holding vDODO will be reduced. More rewards will be shifted to the Membership Points system. You can find the details of the MP system in the proposal on our community forum.\n\nWe propose to reduce the vDODO membership rewards from 12 DODO per block to 6 DODO per block. At the same time, we propose to reduce the exit fee cap from 15% to 10%.\n\n## Options\n\n- Approve（reduce vDODO membership rewards to half, decrease the exit fee cap from 15% to 10%）\n- Reject（no change for vDODO membership rewards and the exit fee cap）\n\n",

      "title": "DIP-10: Migration of 2 Million DODO Tokens each to Avalanche, BOBA, and Moonriver for Future Incentives",
      "content": "# Summary\nDIP-10 proposes migrating and allocating 2 million DODO tokens each to the Avalanche, Boba, and Moonriver Mainnets to be used for liquidity mining and as other trading incentives in the future.\n\n# Motivation\n\nDODO has been deployed on 8 public chains so far. However, with deployment alone, we cannot fully capture potential users and their trading volume. We therefore propose to migrate tokens to these networks and launch incentive campaigns to more effectively capture the value in these networks’ ecosystems.\n\nAvalanche is one of the fastest growing networks in the past year. It is EVM-compatible and operates on a PoS model which features faster transactions and low gas cost.\n\nBoba is a next-generation Optimistic Rollup layer 2 network that reduces gas fees, improves transaction throughput, reduces exit periods, and extends the capabilities of smart contracts.\n\nMoonriver is an EVM-compatible parachain deployed on Kusama, a companion network to Moonbeam and provides a permanently incentivized canary network.\n\nDODO’s integration into the Avalanche, Boba, and Moonriver ecosystems will enable these ecosystems to enjoy the unique benefits and features provided by DODO’s innovative Proactive Market Maker (PMM), such as highly capital-efficient liquidity pools, SmartTrade, Crowdpooling, and more.\n\nToken incentives are an effective way to attract liquidity providers (LPs) and boost trading volume for protocols that are in the growth phase. Providing DODO tokens as incentives on these three networks would also significantly increase the number of DODO token holders, which would spur significant growth for the DODO community.\n\n# Specification\n\nDIP-10 proposes migrating and allocating 2 million DODO tokens each to the Avalanche, Boba, and Moonriver Mainnets to be used for liquidity mining and as other trading incentives in the future.\n\nSince DIP-8 was passed, DODO has acquired a significant competitive advantage in the stablecoin trading market due to our superior aggregation and low trading fees. This advantage brings DODO more users and more trading volume.\n\nStablecoin pairs are usually the most active trading pairs on public chains. Under the new fee structure introduced by DIP-8, incentivizing stablecoin pools with mining rewards is the fastest and the most cost-effective way to attract more users and trading volume, once the migration of DODO tokens to Avalanche, Boba and Moonriver is completed.\n\nIf DIP-10 is passed, the DODO team will migrate and allocate 2 million DODO tokens each to the Avalanche, Boba, and Moonriver Mainnets, and start liquidity mining rewards for their stablecoin pools first, followed by other incentive programs.\n\nNote: These 6 million DODO tokens are DODO’s budget for the Avalanche, Boba, and Moonriver Mainnets, and it is not yet certain whether they will be fully utilized. The tokens will be sourced from the 60% Community Incentives allocation, as specified in the DODOnomics whitepaper.\n\nThis concludes DIP-10. Suggestions and comments from community members are always welcome and encouraged.",

      "title": "DIP-9: Migrating 2 Million DODO to the Polygon PoS Chain for Incentive Programs",
      "content": "##  Abstract\n\nDIP-9 proposes to migrate 2 million DODO to the Polygon Proof of Stake chain for stablecoin liquidity mining and other incentive programs.\n\n## Motivation\n\nDODO expanded its protocol to the Polygon PoS mainnet on June 5, 2021 and is still seeing a good trading volume over the past two quarters without any migration of DODO tokens, and without any liquidity mining incentives. Over the last 3 months, DODO's daily trading volume on the Polygon PoS network has typically remained between $20 million and $70 million.\n\nPolygon has a strong DeFi ecosystem, including lending, trading, and cross-chain infrastructure. Polygon also has low gas fees and a large and active user base. Migrating DODO tokens to the Polygon PoS chain will not only lead to more liquidity, but will also allow us to gain more trading users and allow us to add more application scenarios and instances to attract more new assets.\n\n## Rules\n\nDIP-9 proposes to migrate 2 million DODO to the Polygon PoS chain and launch a USDC-USDT liquidity mining pool to enhance the competitive advantage of the DODO protocol in its on-chain stablecoin market and capture more trading volume and trading users.\n\nThe fees for the USDC-USDT trading pair on the Polygon chain will continue along the DIP-8 fee model - that is, the LP processing fee will be 0 and the protocol's platform fees will remain unchanged. In this case, the USDC-USDT (Polygon) pair fee will be 0.002%, of which 75% will be used to repurchase DODO and distribute to vDODO holders in the form of vDODO, and 25% will be used for the community vault.\n\nAccordingly, DODO will increase the mining reward for the USDC-USDT (Polygon) pair so that it can compensate for the reduction in fees.\n\n## Summary\n\nThe USDC-USDT (Polygon) reward is currently 0.44 DODO per block (0.22 DODO each for USDC and USDT, respectively)\n\nIf DIP-9 is passed, the DODO protocol will create the USDC-USDT (Polygon) pair and open liquidity mining on it, on the Polygon PoS chain. The low transaction fee of 0.002% will significantly increase DODO's competitiveness in the Polygon stablecoin trading market and is expected to lead to a capture of more trading volume and users.\n",

      "title": "DIP-8: Reduction of LP Fees for Major Stablecoin Trading Pairs",
      "content": "\n## Abstract\n\nDIP-8 proposes reducing the LP portion of the trading fee for the USDC-USDT (ETH) and BUSD-USDT (BSC) trading pairs on the DODO platform to improve our competitiveness in the stablecoin trading market. This proposal includes increasing the rewards for LPs to compensate for this decrease.\n\n## Motivation\n\nDODO's stablecoin trading fee is currently 0.01%. Because of this relatively low fee, the liquidity for stablecoin trades on DODO is very good, which gives us a competitive edge in the market. However, DODO's price advantage in the stablecoin trading market has been challenged by the adjustment of the Balancer DAI/USDC/USDT pool’s trading fee to 0.01% and the addition of a pool with a 0.01% swap fee to Uniswap v3.\n\n## Rules\n\nWe propose to adjust two stablecoin trading pairs on the Ether and BSC networks, namely USDC-USDT (ETH) and BUSD-USDT (BSC), by reducing the LP portion of the trading fee to 0 for these two pools, with the other portions of the fee for these pairs remaining unchanged.\n\nEver since the DIP-3 proposal was passed, **80%** of the trading fee was allocated to the liquidity provider (LP), **15%** was used to repurchase DODOs and distribute them to vDODO holders in the form of vDODOs, and **5%** was used to establish a community vault.\n\nIf this DIP-8 proposal is passed, then for the USDC-USDT (ETH) and BUSD-USDT (BSC) pools, the fee will be reduced to 0.002%, of which 75% will be used to repurchase DODOs and distribute them to vDODO holders in the form of vDODOs, and 25% will be used for the community vault.\n\nSince the LPs of both pools will no longer receive a portion of the trading fees, DIP-8 proposes to compensate the LPs by increasing the DODO token rewards for both pairs to cover the LPs’ reduction in fee revenue. Specifically, the token rewards for both pools will be increased by 10%, as follows:\n\n- The USDC-USDT (ETH) rewards will be increased from 2 DODO per block (1 DODO for USDC and USDT respectively) to 2.2 DODO per block.\n- The BUSD-USDT (BSC) rewards will be increased from 0.4 DODO per block (0.2 DODO for BUSD and USDT, respectively) to 0.44 DODO per block.\n\n## Summary\n\n- Lowering the stablecoin trading fees could improve DODO's competitiveness in the stablecoin trading market, and could allow us to gain more trading volume, bring in more users, and potentially attract more whales and professional traders - making DODO the best place for stablecoin trading.\n- LPs on USDC-USDT (ETH) and BUSD-USDT (BSC) will not receive revenue from trading fees, but they will receive more revenue from DODO tokens through the compensation plan and overall revenue will exceed what it was before fees were reduced.\n- Fee income and equity will remain the same for both the platform and vDODO. Increased liquidity will lead to increased trading volume and therefore higher dividends for vDODO holders.\n\n\n",

It enables highly scalable and low-cost smart contracts, and DODO is proud to have the opportunity to join the initial cohort to deploy dApps on the Aurora Mainnet.\n\nDODO’s integration into the Aurora ecosystem will allow Aurora’s users to enjoy the unique benefits and features provided by DODO’s innovative Proactive Market Maker (PMM), such as highly capital-efficient liquidity pools, SmartTrade, Crowdpooling, and more.\n\nToken incentives are an effective way to attract liquidity providers (LPs) and boost trading volume for protocols that are in the growth phase. Providing DODO tokens as incentives on the Aurora Mainnet would also significantly increase the number of DODO token holders, which would spur significant growth for the DODO community.\n\n# Specification\nDIP-7 proposes migrating and allocating $5 million worth of DODO tokens to the Aurora Mainnet to be used for liquidity mining and as other trading incentives in the future.\n\nNote:\nThese $5 million worth of DODO tokens are DODO’s budget for the Aurora Mainnet, and it is not yet certain whether they will be fully utilized. The tokens will be sourced from the 60% Community Incentives allocation, as specified in the DODOnomics whitepaper.\n\n# Available Options\n- Approve\n- Reject\n\nThis concludes DIP-7. Suggestions and comments from community members are always welcome and encouraged.",

      "content": "## Background\n\nDIP-3 Implemented a DODO Community Treasury that is made up of 5% of all LP fees collected from DODO liquidity pools. These Community funds are there to be used by the DODO community in various ways once consensus has been reached on what the funds should be used for. This proposal sets out a Community Governance framework to ensure that proper protocols and procedures are in place for the DODO Community Treasury.\n\n## Community Treasury Framework:\n\n- Proposals can only be submitted by the DODO community, they cannot be made by or on behalf of the core DODO team\n\n- Proposals MUST be related to the DODO ecosystem and the DODO community must see benefits or advantages for DODO / vDODO holders from the proposal. \n\n- There is a minimum proposal amount of $5,000 and the maximum proposal amount is no more than 50% of the total Community Treasury balance for any one proposal. The same proposal cannot be submitted multiple times at different amounts.  \n\n- To submit a proposal, the proposer must hold at least 100 vDODO to submit any proposal for the Community Treasury. If you do not have 100 vDODO you will need to get someone eligible to sponsor your proposal and put forward the vote.\n\n- Proposals can only be transactional in nature, they cannot propose to engage in legal agreements or any such matters that require representation to be made via contractual obligations.\n\n- Proposal voting period must be open for a minimum of 7 days to ensure that all interested parties can understand the proposal and vote accordingly.\n\n- For a proposal to be passed and fully implemented there is a minimum number of votes and voters (25) required to ensure consensus based on the proposal amount as below:\n\n  - $5,000 - $10,000 - 1.5 Million total votes required\n  - $10,000 - $20,000 - 2.0 Million total  votes required \n  - $20,000 - $50,000 - 2.5 million total votes required\n  - $50,000+ - 3 million total votes required \n\nNote: if the minimum number of votes or voters is not reached then the proposal is considered to be rejected.\n\n- Once a proposal has been passed the DODO Community Treasury Multisig will have 7 days in which to implement and action the proposal.\n\n- If a proposal is rejected, the proposal cannot be submitted again in current form for at least 90 days. A modified proposal can be suggested if there is community consensus based on the previous vote and discussion held.\n\nThe above guidelines once approved are deemed to be final unless a vote is implemented to make changes to the proposal. In this case, the normal DIP requirements and rules would need to be followed to make changes to the existing Community Treasury framework.\n\n## Available Options\n- Approve\n- Reject\n\n## Governance Vote\n\nVoting Period: Aug 25, 2021 at 1:00 PM to Aug 27, 2021 at 1:00 PM SGT (Singapore time)\n\nVoting Method: Users with both DODO tokens and vDODO tokens can vote via Snapshot. 1 DODO represents 1 vote and 1 vDODO represents 100 votes. Casting votes will not incur any gas fee.\n\nVote for the proposal by clicking on the option that you agree with the most. Feel free to post your thoughts and alternative proposals to DODO’s community forum.\n\nIf the total number of votes reaches at least 2 million, the DODO Team will implement the proposal using the option that receives the most votes.\n\nNote: If you have DODO tokens, make sure that they are in wallets on Ethereum mainnet (wallets on centralized exchanges or Binance Smart Chain will not give you votes).\n",

Benefits for vDODO token holders include but are not limited to the following: governance rights, crowdpooling and IDO allocations, trading fee discounts, dividends paid out from trading fees, vDODO membership rewards, and governance rights. \n\nCurrently, vDODO tokens are not transferable. vDODO tokens  are minted at a fixed rate of 100 DODO = 1 vDODO (100:1). vDODOs are tied to their minting addresses and therefore cannot be transferred. In order to redeem vDODO back to DODO tokens, users need to pay an exit fee, which will then be distributed to all remaining vDODO holders. \n\nThe non-transferability of vDODO restricts vDODO’s token utility and use cases. Making vDODO tokens transferable would unshackle such restrictions and allow for future use cases such as :\n\n- Collateral: vDODO tokens could be used as collateral on various lending platforms (subject to implementation)\n- Free Trades: vDODO tokens could be traded on the open market \n- Transferability: vDODO holders are free to move their tokens as they see fit without limitations\n\n# Available Options \n\nYes - vDODO tokens are transferable\nNo - vDODO tokens remain non-transferable\n\n# Governance Vote\n\nVoting Period: July 21, 2021 at 1:00 PM to July 23, 2021 at 1:00 PM SGT (Singapore time)\n\nVoting Method: Users with both DODO tokens and vDODO tokens can vote via Snapshot. 1 DODO represents 1 vote and 1 vDODO represents 100 votes.

It enables highly scalable and low-cost smart contracts, and DODO is proud to have the opportunity to join the initial cohort to build dApps on the Arbitrum Mainnet beta. \n\nDODO’s integration into the Arbitrum ecosystem will allow Arbitrum’s users to enjoy the unique benefits and features provided by DODO’s innovative Proactive Market Maker (PMM), such as highly capital-efficient liquidity pools, SmartTrade, Crowdpooling, and more. \n\nToken incentives are an effective way to attract liquidity providers (LPs) and boost trading volume for protocols that are in the growth phase. Providing DODO tokens as incentives on the Arbitrum Mainnet would also significantly increase the number of DODO token holders, which would spur significant growth for the DODO community.\n\n# Specification\n\nDIP-4 proposes migrating and allocating 5 million DODO tokens to the Arbitrum Mainnet to be used for liquidity mining and as other trading incentives in the future.\n\n**Note:** \nThese 5 million DODO tokens are DODO’s budget for the Arbitrum Mainnet, and it is not yet certain whether they will be fully utilized. The tokens will be sourced from the 60% Community Incentives allocation, as specified in the DODOnomics whitepaper. \n \n# Available Options\n- Approve\n- Reject\n\nThis concludes DIP-4. Suggestions and comments from community members are always welcome and encouraged. A governance vote on the proposal with the aforementioned options will be created on Snapshot.\n\n# Governance Vote\n\n**Voting Period:** July 14, 2021 at 1:00PM to July 17, 2021 1:00 PM SGT\n\n**Voting Method:** Users with both DODO tokens and vDODO tokens can vote via Snapshot. 1 DODO represents 1 vote and 1 vDODO represents 100 votes.

      "title": "DIP-3: Trading Fees Reallocation and Community Treasury ",
      "content": "# Summary\n\nDIP-3 is proposing to reallocate a percentage of future trading fees from liquidity pools on DODO. The fees collected will be utilized for two purposes: to buy back DODO tokens from the DODO-USDT liquidity pool on DODO and redistribute them to all vDODO holders, and to establish a multi-purpose community treasury.\n\n# Motivation\n\nIn DODO’s V2 Tokenomics, trading fee reallocation is one of the most critical token models. As DODO’s multichain deployment progresses and the DODO platform’s user base increases rapidly, the platform’s trading volume has been growing exponentially.\n\nWhile the user base and the total trading volume of the DODO platform continue to increase, it is necessary to tie platform growth together with token value capture. Reallocating a percentage of trading fees to buy back DODO tokens and then redistribute them to vDODO holders, and establish a community treasury are remarkably beneficial to DODO’s token holders and the DODO platform’s growth in the long run. \n\n# Specification \n\nThere are three types of liquidity pools available on DODO DEX: DODO Classic Pool, DODO Vending Machine, and DODO Private Pool.\n\nAlthough each liquidity pool’s trading fees on DODO are set and configured by its creator and may vary from one another, the default trading fee for a pair on DODO is 0.3%, with the exception of DODO Classic Pool’s single-sided liquidity pools, which have a default trading fee of 0.01%. \n\nDIP-3 proposes that 80% of future trading fees on DODO will be distributed to liquidity providers (LPs), and 15% will be used for the buyback of DODO tokens (to then be distributed to vDODO holders as vDODO), and the remaining 5% will be used to fund a community treasury. \n\nFor example,  assuming a liquidity pool has a trading fee of 0.3%. If DIP-3 is to be implemented, 0.24% of the total trading volume in the pool will be distributed to LPs as rewards, and 0.045% of the total trading volume will be used to buy back DODO Tokens (to then be distributed to vDODO holders as vDODO), and 0.015% of the total trading volume will be used to fund the community treasury.  \n\n# Available Options\n\nApprove: agree with the proposal of trading fees reallocation (80% to LPs, 15% for DODO tokens buyback, and 5% for the community treasury)\n\nReject: disagree with the proposal.  LPs should continue to receive 100% of trading fees accrued from liquidity pools on DODO\n\nThis concludes DIP-3. Suggestions and comments from community members are always welcome and encouraged. A governance vote on the proposal with the aforementioned options will be created on Snapshot.\n\n# Governance Vote\n\nVoting Period: June 15, 2021 at 1:00PM to June 18, 2021 1:00PM UTC+8 (Beijing time)\n\nVoting Method: Users with both DODO tokens and vDODO tokens can vote via Snapshot. 1 DODO represents 1 vote and 1 vDODO represents 100 votes.

      "content": "### **Summary**\n\nDIP-2 is proposing a deflationary mechanism for the DODO tokenomic model that consists of burning 50% of future vDODO membership exit fee tokens.\n\n### **Motivation**\n\nAs the user base of the DODO platform and the amount of DODO tokens in circulation continue to increase, it is necessary to tie platform growth together with token value capture. The goal of DIP-2 is to increase the number of DODO and vDODO token holders and to generate more benefits for them.\n\n### **Specification**\n\nCurrently, vDODO holders need to pay an exit fee to exit the DODO membership system, and the exit fee rate varies with the ratio of the total staked DODO tokens to the total DODO tokens in circulation. The exit fees are then immediately distributed to all remaining vDODO holders who have not exited.\n\nIf approved and implemented, DIP-2 could introduce an effective deflationary mechanism for the DODO token economic model. Specifically, more DODO tokens are burned over time as the number of vDODO members choosing to exit DODO membership increases, causing the total number of DODO tokens to decrease, and thus reducing selling pressure in the secondary market. However, vDODO holders would have to accept lower yields (i.e. exit fee payouts) if 50% of future vDODO exit fees were burned.\n\n### **Available Options**\n\nThere are two (2) options for the DODO community on DIP-2.\n\n1. Approve the burning of 50% of future vDODO membership exit fee tokens.\n2. Disapprove the burning of 50% of future vDODO membership exit fee tokens.\n\n### **Governance Vote**\n\n**Voting Period:** May 18, 2021 at 15:00PM to May 21, 2021 15:00PM UTC+8 (Singapore time)\n\n**Voting Method:** Users with both DODO tokens and vDODO tokens can vote via Snapshot. 1 DODO represents 1 vote and 1 vDODO represents 100 votes. Casting votes will not incur any gas fee.\n\nIf you approve of the proposal, click Option1. If you disprove of the proposal, click option2 and consider posting your thoughts and alternative proposals to DODO’s community forum. Feel free to post your thoughts and alternative proposals to DODO’s community forum.\n\nIf the total number of votes reaches at least 2 million and “Approve” receives a majority of the votes, the DODO team will implement the proposal.\n\n**Note:** If you have DODO tokens, make sure that they are in wallets on Ethereum mainnet (wallets on centralized exchanges or Binance Smart Chain will not give you votes).",

      "title": "DIP-1: DODO Booster",
      "content": "Since the inception of DODO v2.0, DODO's trading volume and trader numbers have grown rapidly. Built on the flexible Proactive Market Maker algorithm (PMM), the DODO platform now supports a variety of use cases and features, including DODO Vending Machine, DODO Private Pool, DODO Classic Pool, and Crowdpooling, among others.\n\nThe DODO team is proposing the implementation of the DODO Booster program with the aim of attracting more high quality projects to establish liquidity pools on the platform, as well as increasing user activity and trading volume to help build a sustainable community ecosystem going forward.\n\n### What is DODO Booster?\n\nDODO Booster is a liquidity incentive program that rewards liquidity providers (LPs) with DODO tokens for project token pools that meet certain criteria. \n\n### Why DODO Booster?\n\nThe DODO Booster program provides well-defined incentives that encourage project teams to launch their project tokens on, or to migrate liquidity for their tokens to the DODO platform. This directly translates to a sustainable increase in DODO's total value locked (TVL) and improved trading experience for existing users. At the same time, the Booster program can also allow and attract more people to learn about DODO's innovative products and features and eventually become frequent DODO users.\n\n### DODO Booster Liquidity Mining Details\n\n**1. Incentive Program**\n\nFor each qualified project, its DODO Booster program shall run for four (4) weeks. Each week, the DODO team will allocate the equivalent of $7,500-$45,000 in DODO tokens as mining rewards. \n\nThe DODO team shall determine each week's mining reward amount for the project token's liquidity pool based on the pool's trading volume for the week prior. These weekly reward adjustments are instituted to incentivize LPs to continue liquidity provision throughout the program period. More concretely, during the 4-week program period, the higher the trading volume for the liquidity pool for the current week, the more the liquidity mining rewards for the following week. \n\nThere are four (4) tiers of liquidity pools differentiated by their weekly/7-day trading volumes:\n\n(a) Liquidity pool with a 7-day trading volume of < $5,000,000 will be allocated the equivalent of $7,500 in DODO tokens as the base reward the following week.\n\n(b) If $5,000,000 ≤  liquidity pool's 7-day volume < $10,000,000, the equivalent of $15,000 in DODO tokens will be allocated the following week.\n\n(c) $10,000,000 ≤ liquidity pool's 7-day volume < $15,000,000, the equivalent of $30,000 in DODO tokens will be allocated the following week.\n\n(d) Liquidity pool with a 7-day trading volume of ≥ $15,000,000 will be allocated the equivalent of $45,000 in DODO tokens the following week.\n\nUnder normal circumstances, each project's liquidity pool enters the DODO Booster incentive program with an initial mining reward of $7,500 in DODO tokens for the first week.\n\nIf a project token's 7-day weekly volume remains below $5,000,000 throughout the 4-week incentive period, then the project's liquidity mining bonus will remain at $7,500 in DODO tokens each week.\n\nExample: A project (whose token is XYZ) establishes a XYZ/DODO liquidity pool on the DODO platform. In the first week, $7,500 worth of DODO tokens are distributed to the pool's LPs based on the LP's share. If the cumulative volume of the liquidity pool reaches $12 million in the first week, we will allocate the equivalent of $30,000 in DODO reward tokens in the second week. If the cumulative volume of the liquidity pool drops to $8 million in the second week, we will allocate the equivalent of $15,000 in DODO bonus tokens in the third week. If the cumulative volume of the liquidity pool reaches $15 million in the third week, we will allocate the equivalent of $45,000 in DODO bonus tokens in the fourth week.\n\nAssuming LPs are contributing a total of $800,000 to the XYZ/DODO pool during the second week, the APY is [($30,000 / 7) * 365] / $800,000 ≈ 195.54%.\n\n**2. \"Super Booster\" Mode**\n\nDepending on the new project's liquidity pool performance and contribution to ecosystem growth on DODO,  an additional 2x to 3x liquidity mining bonus via the \"Super Booster\" mode may be applied during the incentive period. This added bonus will become effective the following week and last for one (1) week.\n\nFor new projects that debuted on the DODO platform with either a Crowdpooling campaign or DODO Vending Machine, it is possible for the Super Booster mode to be applied from the very first week of the incentive period. That is, up to $22,500 (3x $7,500) worth of DODO tokens may be allocated to LPs as initial rewards during the first week.\n\nFor projects that did not debut on DODO, the Super Booster mode may be flexibly applied on a case-by-case basis, based on the project's trading data on DODO and its marketing proposals.\n\n**3. Joint Mining**\n\nThe project team may also opt to provide tokens for liquidity mining. If the project's application for DODO Booster has been approved, a joint mining campaign will be set up and LPs will be able to receive both reward tokens (DODO and the project token) when providing liquidity.\n\n**4. Applying for DODO Booster**\n\nThe primary objective of DODO Booster is to encourage projects to establish their main liquidity pool on the DODO platform (i.e. its liquidity pool on DODO has the largest share of the token's aggregate liquidity across all platforms). During its initial phase, DODO Booster shall lower the entry threshold appropriately to make onboarding projects easier. The DODO team will adjust the threshold as the program progresses.\n\nIf a project team has not yet issued its project token, it needs to meet any 2 of the following 3 conditions to be eligible to apply for DODO Booster:\n\n1. The project conducts an exclusive IDO on the DODO platform, or uses DODO as one of its initial IDO platforms (simultaneously with other platforms with the same start time).\n2. The project establishes its main liquidity pool (largest liquidity pool for the project token across all platforms) on either DODO Ethereum or DODO Binance Smart Chain (BSC).\n3. The project uses DODO as the fundraising token of choice when launching its Crowdpooling campaign on the DODO platform.\n\nIf a project team has already issued its project token elsewhere, it needs to meet any 2 of the following 3 conditions to be eligible to apply for DODO Booster:\n\n1. The project migrates its main liquidity pool (largest liquidity pool for the project token across all platforms) to either DODO Ethereum or DODO Binance Smart Chain (BSC).\n2. The project provides tokens for liquidity mining and allocates the majority of token rewards for LPs on the DODO platform.\n3. The project establishes a liquidity pool that pairs its token with the DODO token as a trading pair, i.e. a XYZ/DODO pool if the project token is XYZ.\n\n[New Project Application Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScpqNhqlAOSrHzpHvJIkI1n5FSCZ0wcFXE2QW-_YMCw13XTfw/viewform?usp=sf_link)\n\n[Application Form for Projects Already in Circulation](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfbDlgRjMCGeh48iLQmfaS1bXbrOFAKvqmpxRHd3ZfxKIzgcg/viewform?usp=sf_link)\n\nDODO Booster's list of basic application requirements is not exhaustive. During the initial phase of DODO Booster, the DODO team shall review and conduct due diligence on projects applying to enter the program. As the program matures and more projects onboard, new project applications will be reviewed and approved/rejected collectively by the community with a vDODO-based decentralized governance structure.\n\nAfter a project has been approved for DODO Booster, the aforementioned four-week liquidity mining incentive program will be set up for the liquidity pool designated by the project team.\n\nThis concludes the DODO team's proposal for the DODO Booster program. It is our hope and belief that it will help bring more projects and users to the DODO platform. Suggestions and comments from community members are always welcome and a governance vote on the proposal has been created on Snapshot. See below for more details on the vote.\n\n### Vote Rules\n\nVoting Period: 2 days, from April 17, 2021 at 11:00AM to April 19, 2021 11:00AM UTC+8 (Singapore time)\n\nVoting Method: Users with both DODO tokens and vDODO tokens can vote via Snapshot. 1 DODO represents 1 vote and 1 vDODO represents 100 votes.
