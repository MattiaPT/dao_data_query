      "title": "#77 Staking Champions League",
      "content": "Proposal to launch the Staking Champions League (SCL). \n\nMotivation\n\nAfter unstaking parameters were relaxed earlier this month, the DAO received numerous requests from the community to recognize, reward, and edify its more dedicated stakers. After careful consideration, the developers agree and seek approval for this proposal.\n\nTop 100 Champions\n\nAll MetFi NFT owners are encouraged to participate and become an Inaugural Top 100 Staking Champion. \n\nThe intent is to recognize, edify, and award the Top 100 Staking Champions on stage at Ocean Summit III. Since Ocean Summit III has not yet been scheduled and voted on (that will come later), the exact end date of Season I needs to be somewhat flexible till then. However, the intent is for this promotion (Season I) to run for as long as possible but no later than the opening day of Ocean Summit III. \n\nHow It Works\n\nOnly new $METFI staking will be counted to ensure participant fairness. The USDT value of $METFI staked will start counting when the Staking Champions League goes live on July 9, 2024, at 00:00 UTC.\n\nHow to Qualify\n\nQualify and remain qualified by fulfilling all three (3) of these actions: \n\n1)\tStay 100 USDT cycle qualified throughout the promotion period,\n2)\tDo not unstake, even partially,\n3)\tCollect volume on all $METFI that you and your personally referred members Buy & Stake in the MetFi dApp.   \n\nN.B: Staking volume can only accumulate after July 9, 2024, and the participant must also be 100 USDT cycle qualified for the volume to start accumulating. Users who were not 100 USDT cycle qualified before 9 July 2024 will be unable to accumulate staking volume before the next cycle begins.  \n\nN.B: If you skip a 100 USDT cycle or unstake any $METFI tokens during the promotion period, all accumulated volume is reset to zero, and you must start again.\n\nCalculations\n\nThe USDT value of all $METFI tokens that you and your personally referred users generate via the following activities is counted: \n\no Buy & Stake $METFI in the dApp - you and your personal referrals volume,\no Newly staked $METFI from buying and upgrading NFTs, including the 10% complimentary $METFI accompanying NFT purchases and any additional $METFI purchased and staked.\n\nAwards for Top 100 Staking League Champions\n\nRanks 100-51\nExclusive Diamond Staking Champions NFT,\nInclusion in the Top 100 Staking Champions League 2025,\nRecognition and award on stage at the Ocean Summit III 2025.\n\nRanks 50-21\nExclusive BLUE Diamond Staking Champions NFT,\nInclusion in the Top 50 Staking Champions League 2025,\nRecognition and award on stage at the Ocean Summit III 2025.\n\nRanks 20-11\nExclusive BLACK Diamond Staking Champions NFT,\nInclusion in the Top 20 Staking Champions League 2025,\nRecognition and award on stage at the Ocean Summit III 2025.\n\nRanks 10-1\nExclusive CROWN Diamond Staking Champions NFT,\nInclusion in the Top 10 Staking Champions League 2025,\nRecognition and award on stage at the Ocean Summit III 2025, plus an invitation to speak on stage.\n\nTop 10 Champions\n\nThe 10 Champions with the highest accumulated USDT value staked at the end of the promotion will share 100,000 unlocked $METFI after Ocean Summit III.\n\n#10 – 5,000\n#9 – 5,000\n#8 - 5,000\n#7 – 6,000\n#6 – 7,000\n#5 – 8,000\n#4 – 9,000\n#3 – 10,000\n#2 – 15,000\n#1 – 30,000\n\nProposal\n\nLaunch the Staking Champions League on July 9, 2024, and approve a 100,000 $METFI prize pool.\n\nVote Discussion\n\nJoin the discussion on this proposal in the MetFi DAO Discord and head to the #vote-discussion channel. \n\nVote\n\nIf the community approves this proposal with a FOR vote, the Staking Champions League will launch on July 9, 2024.\n\nPlease vote FOR to approve this proposal or AGAINST to block this proposal.",

      "content": "Proposal to deploy ISA+ recognition program.\n\nMotivation\n\nThe Influencer Star Achievers Plus (ISA+) program will incentivize community members who consistently contribute to the DAO for the purpose of recognition and edification.\n\nHow It Works\n\nThis is a very simple star-based system for everyone!\n\nTo qualify, you only need to earn one (1) star every 28 days.\n\nGenerate 100 USDT of personal activity every 28 days to receive one ISA+ star via any of the following actions:\n\no Buying and Staking $METFI in the dApp,\no Gifting MetFi NFTs\no Upgrading your own MetFi NFT.\n\nThe ISA+ cycle dates are the same as the existing Influencer Star Achiever (ISA) 28-day cycles. The MetFi dApp will be updated with a dashboard for users to track their activity and stars. \n\nStart Date: July 9th, 00:00 UTC\n\nA maximum of 1 star can be earned per cycle.\n\nWhen you qualify during a cycle, you receive one star in the next cycle. Each subsequent qualified cycle adds another star to your rank, and so on - your stars accumulate.\n\nN.B: If you skip a cycle, all your accumulated stars are reset to zero, and you must start again.\n\nProposal\n\nDeploy the ISA+ recognition program.\n\nVote Discussion\n\nJoin the discussion on this proposal in the MetFi DAO Discord and head to the #vote-discussion channel. \n\nVote\n\nIf the community approves this proposal with a FOR vote, the ISA+ program will start on July 9, 2024.\n\nPlease vote FOR to approve this proposal or AGAINST to block this proposal.",

      "title": "Unlocking Partial Unstaking",
      "content": "Dear MetFi Community,\n\nIt's been over two years since the launch of MetFi! With the recent launch of Marine Moguls and the successful completion of Ocean Summit 2, we have made remarkable progress together. Now, we believe it's time to take the next big step and transition MetFi from its protective infancy into a more mature, thriving ecosystem.\n\nWhat Are We Proposing?\nWe propose releasing the staking constraints that have been in place. Over the past two years, we’ve received hundreds of requests for this feature. Now, with the halvings passing and the introduction of MetBot, staking has naturally taken a back seat. It seems the perfect moment to allow flexibility without requiring you to burn your MetFi.\n\nWhat Does This Mean for You?\nIf the vote passes:\n•\tYou can unstake as many of your METFI tokens as you like without needing to burn your NFT.\n•\tYou will continue earning commissions.\n•\tYou will retain your Moguls and MetBot access.\n\nStaking Rewards Continue\nStaking rewards will remain unchanged. The only difference is you will have the flexibility to take profits whenever you wish.\n\nUnstaking Event\nTo prevent manipulation and front-running, we will hold a special unstaking event 2 days after the vote if the vote passes. During this special 24-hour period, you can unstake your METFI immediately. After this initial window, the staking process will revert to a 7-day waiting period, but you will have the freedom to choose how much you want to unstake, and your NFT will not be burned.\n\nAddressing Short-Term Concerns\nWe understand there may be short-term sell pressure, but the token performance over the last year suggests this change will help establish the true token value faster, setting the stage for future growth.\nTo discuss this vote, visit our Discord or Telegram Channels.\n\nA New Chapter for MetFi\nThis proposal marks the end of MetFi's initial phase and the beginning of a new, more mature era. Our treasury remains strong, and with MetBot on the horizon, the future looks incredibly promising.\n\nLet's take this important step forward together. See you on the other side.\n\nDates To Remember\n3rd of June 10am UTC – Vote Ends\n5th of June 10am UTC – Special Unstaking Period Starts\n6th of June 10am UTC – Normal Unstaking Period Starts",

      "title": "#71 MetBot Development",
      "content": "Proposal to continue developing MetBot. \n\nBackground\n\nMetBot is a high-frequency crypto trading bot that is being developed by MetFi DAO. \n\nDeveloping MetBot has not been a simple task, it has required significant time, money, and effort to reach the stage it is at now. The devs have been quietly developing and testing MetBot at their own expense for almost 10 months and are pleased with the initial results.\n\nWe are already on the 2nd version of the signal structures.\n\nLive testing on the USDT/BTC trading pair produced high two-digit returns during November and December. These are significant and promising results that now warrant further development, making this a good time to reveal more information about MetBot to the community. \n\nGoals\n\nThe goals for MetBot are:\n\n- create a new passive revenue stream for all MetFiers,\n- create a new highly desirable and commissionable product for affiliates,\n- create a profitable and sustainable high-frequency trading bot that will perform consistently in all market conditions,\n- provide full transparency on the performance of MetBot including the status of funds, and executed trades. \n\nAs always, all of the above will be on-chain and fully above board with transparent trades that can be tracked and audited by the community at any time, with no funny business or fake trades, that’s a promise. \n\nNext Steps\n\nThere is still a lot of work to do but we are well on our way. As we continue to work on the signals and trading a significant amount of time is also been spent to ensure that MetBot benefits the entire MetFi community – this includes but is not limited to potentially setting account trading limits to safeguard long-term profitability and sustainability as well as fine-tuning the affiliate rewards that Metbot generates. \n\nIf this proposal is approved and everything goes to plan the intent is to conduct a closed and limited beta test where some members of the community will be able to deposit funds and allow MetBot to execute trades on their behalf. After a successful beta test MetBot will be opened up to more MetFiers, possibly incrementally. \n\nWe will publish more information about MetBot and its integration into the MetFi ecosystem at the appropriate time.\n\nProposal\n\n1) Acquire a trading platform and connect it to the signals professionally and sustainably. This cost is 20,000 USDT one time, \n\n2) Intensify building the signals and connecting them to the trading platform to create a robust and sustainable Metbot. Development cost will be 15,000 USDT per month – till now the devs have borne this and other costs as a gift to the community.\n\nCost\n\n- 20,000 USDT one-time for trading platform,\n- 15,000 USDT per month for development. \n\nVote Discussion\n\nJoin the discussion on this proposal in the MetFi DAO Discord and head to the #vote-discussion channel. \n\nVote\n\nPlease vote FOR to approve this proposal or AGAINST to block this proposal.",

      "content": "Proposal to add an amendment to the treasury claims schedule.\n\nBackground\n\nThe treasury claims module was completed several weeks ago and is ready to deploy when it is desirable to do so.\n\nSo, the question is when is the most desirable time to deploy it?\n\nMotivation\n\nExtract the most value possible from the assets we hold for the community.\n\nAssets\n\nSeeing that our DAO primarily invests in early-stage Web3 projects, most of the projects we have invested in have not yet launched so they need time to finish building their products and bringing them to market.\n\nReleasing treasury assets for claiming now would devalue the METFI token and remove the potential for the treasury assets to mature.\n\nMarket Cycle Potential\n\nIt’s a well-known fact that the optimal time to sell any asset is when prices are high.\n\nIf history repeats itself, we should see the market significantly increase in value over the next 12-24 months \n\nWhile no guarantees of future potential values can be made, if historical market cycles repeat, the value of the assets we hold could increase significantly.\n\nThe devs strongly recommend voting in favor of this proposal with a FOR vote, as making any treasury claims this early in the cycle would most likely end up as a loss for the entire community. \n\nVote Discussion\n\nJoin the discussion on this proposal in the MetFi DAO Discord and head to the #vote-discussion channel. \n\nProposal\n\nIf the community approves this proposal with a FOR vote – the DAO will hold the treasury assets in the short term and will revisit this topic when one or more treasury assets have had time to mature.\n\nPlease vote FOR to approve this proposal or AGAINST to block this proposal.",

      "content": "Proposal to add more developers to the team. \n\nMotivation\n\nOur ecosystem continues to expand and for the DAO to continue operating efficiently the development team needs to expand.\n\nIn software and blockchain development there is a well-established concept called ‘technical debt’, also known as ‘design debt’ or ‘code debt. Technical debt accrues when in an effort to bring protocol enhancements and new products to market in a timely manner, the devs do not have the resources they would like to essentially ‘polish and perfect the code’ as much as they would like to. When this happens ‘technical debt’ begins to accumulate because at some point in time the cost (technical debt) to ‘polish and perfect the code’ becomes much greater than the cost of hiring additional developers today and this is the point we are at now. \n\nFurther, the server infrastructure is becoming significantly more complex with product releases like MetaQuiz, and with the launch later this year of MetaBid the devs want to get on the front foot now. \n\nBenefits\n\nFrom a Development perspective:\n- More polished final products faster,\n- Development of some smaller products and enhancements in parallel,\n- Lowering technical debt\n- Handling bug fixes and existing product improvements without slowing ongoing development,\n- Broadening of team knowledge with new skills,\n- Faster response times to changes,\n- Larger development capacity.\n\nFrom a DevOps perspective:\n- More proactive system monitoring,\n- Setting up of more redundant systems and backups,\n- Improving monitoring system,\n- Helping the development team with systems operations so as to free up their time,\n- Setting up virtual machines and host servers,\n- Managing self-hosted mail server,\n- Monitoring, managing, and updating BSC nodes,\n- Setting up a public system status page.\n\nAdditional Developers\n\nWe propose adding 4 Developers (2 Senior and 2 Junior) and 1 DevOps.\n\nDevOps practices enable software development (Dev) and operations (Ops) teams to accelerate delivery through automation, collaboration, fast feedback, and iterative improvement.\n\nBudget\n\nUp to 34,000 USDT per month\n\nVote Discussion\n\nJoin the discussion in the #vote-discussion channel of the MetFi DAO Discord. \n\nProposal\n\nIf the community approves this proposal with a FOR vote 4 developers and 1 DevOps will be added to the team.\n\nPlease vote FOR to approve this proposal or AGAINST to block this proposal.",

      "title": "#52 MetaQuiz Top Up",
      "content": "Proposal to top up the MetaQuiz prize pool.\n\nMotivation\n\nMaintain a minimum MetaQuiz total prize pool of 10,000 USDT so as to always make the game appealing to participants.\n\nHow it Works\n\nAt the conclusion of every MetaQuiz prize draw if the next weeks prize pool is less than 10,000 USDT a smart contract will top up the MetaQuiz prize pool. For example, if the prize pool is 9,000 USDT at the start of the next weeks draw a smart contract will immediately send 1,000 USDT to the prize pool.\n\nWith a probability factor of a 1 in 4 chance of a 1st prize been won each week, plus jackpots, plus ticket sales going to the next weeks draw we don’t expect this will be needed often, if ever but we are recommending to have this smart contract in place as a backup so that the prize is always attractive. \n\nTop up transactions will not go through 48-hour multi-sig – similar to how commissions are distributed instantly via smart contracts. \n\nTheoretically and on average with a 1 in 4 probability factor the maximum amount that would be needed each month is 10,000 USDT and that is if no one played MetaQuiz and the winner was always a Humpback.\n\nVote Discussion\n\nJoin the discussion in the #vote-discussion channel of our MetFi DAO Discord. \n\nProposal\n\nIf the community approves this proposal with a FOR vote a smart contract will maintain a minimum balance of 10,000 USDT at the start of each weeks MetaQuiz prize pool.\n\nPlease vote FOR to approve this proposal or AGAINST to block this proposal.",

      "title": "#51 Adding Liquidity",
      "content": "Proposal to add liquidity to our market maker accounts.\n\nBackground\n\nMarket makers or liquidity providers pair up buy and sell orders from traders on centralized exchanges and act as a counterparty in case no one is willing to take the other side of the trade at a specific price. \n\nFor example, if the highest METFI buy order is 2.02 USDT and the lowest sell order is 2.10 USDT there is a gap of 0.08 USDT and this is called the ‘spread’ i.e. the difference/gap between buyers sellers.\n\nIn these instances the market maker bridges that gap by buying or selling so as to give traders a good experience trading the token and not waiting for hours or days to have their orders filled.\n\nThe DAO has had a market maker performing this service since our first CEX listing and we have always provided them with the METFI tokens to trade. \n\nOur market maker trades the DAOs METFI tokens, they do not dump or sell them on to the market but rather recirculate them by buying and selling.\n\nThe DAO always owns and controls these METFI tokens. \n \nMotivation\n\nWe are expecting increased interest in METFI after MetaQuiz Beta launches later this month.\n\nProviding additional liquidity to our market maker accounts on Gate and MEXC will allow the market maker to facilitate more trades, reduce the spread and give traders a better overall experience trading METFI which should correspond with an increase in trading volumes. \n\nThis liquidity will also be used to arbitrage or equalize the prices between CEXs and DEXs and improve price stability.  \n\nLiquidity\n\nThe proposal is to send 170,000 METFI tokens from the METFI Vault to our market maker wallet.\n\nRemember, the DAO owns these tokens.\n\nVote Discussion\n\nJoin the discussion in the #vote-discussion channel of our MetFi DAO Discord. \n\nProposal\n\nIf the community approves this proposal with a FOR vote 170,000 METFI tokens will move from the METFI Vault to the market maker wallet.\n\nPlease vote FOR to approve this proposal or AGAINST to block this proposal.",

You can read about VRF and RNG and how it is impossible to be tampered with, even by the smart contract developers here: https://docs.chain.link/vrf/v2/introduction \n\n2)\tPrize Pool Split\n\nAllocate a portion of each week’s MetaQuiz ticket sales to the following week’s draw.\n\nIf approved, 50% of MetaQuiz ticket sales will still go to the prize pool however the smart contract will send some of the weekly ticket sales revenue to the current weeks draw and some to next week’s draw. \n\nTheoretically, as weeks pass by the prize pool at the start of the next week is larger making it more attractive for players to participate earlier.\n\n3)\tRewards Pool\n\nDistribute 10% of the rewards pool (5% of MetaQuiz ticket sales) to the personal referrer of the MetaQuiz ticket purchaser as a fixed bonus, similar to Fast Start Rewards but without an expiry date. The remaining 90% of the rewards pool would be distributed as MetaQuiz Rewards just as they are today.\n\nVote Discussion\n\nJoin the discussion in the #vote-discussion channel of our MetFi DAO Discord. \n\nProposal\n\nIf the community approves this proposal with a FOR vote all three (3) MetaQuiz enhancements will be deployed as soon as possible.\n\nPlease vote FOR to approve this proposal or AGAINST to block this proposal.",

      "content": "Proposal to amend proposal #45 MetFier Rewards qualifier.\n\nBackground\n\nAfter Proposal #45 was posted a few days ago a number of enhancements were suggested by the community.\n\nAfter collating the suggestions, a sentiment check was posted in our Discord and the community chose their preferred model.\n\nThis governance vote (proposal #47) reflects what the majority of community members requested so if this proposal #47 passes it will supersede Proposal #45, found here: https://dao.metfi.io/#/proposal/0xfcaa6fb9b9425538d129afbff25536b04afcccd7bb698f1d6b6a8f5c3bdc3b63\n\nHow It Works\n\nLeave the existing MetFier Rewards model as it is today without a qualifier for the rewards that MetFi launched with. This means that Matrix, Fast Start, Matching, and Token Staking Rewards DO NOT require an account to be qualified to receive these rewards.\n\nNew products (post-launch) such as MetaQuiz, MetaBid, Supercharge Rewards, and Star Achiever Rewards and all future product rewards WILL require an account to be qualified to receive these rewards.\n\nThe qualification criteria to receive rewards on the new products are as follows:\n\n1) Hold a Shrimp (or higher) NFT\n2) Generate a monthly minimum of 100 USDT of transactional activity from your wallet by:\no Upgrading your NFT\no Buying or gifting MetaQuiz tickets\no Buying or gifting MetaBid BIDs (see proposal #46)\no Gifting NFTs (including Plankton)\no Future product purchases and/or gifts.\n\nThe monthly cycle will be 4 weeks long and will start for everyone on the same date and time and there will be a countdown showing the remaining time and how much your wallet has generated and/or needs to generate for the month. \n\nQualifications will always be for the NEXT 4-week cycle. When buying or being gifted your first NFT users will be automatically qualified for the current and next cycle.\n\nThere may be additional requirements to earn commissions on specific products (see proposal #46 MetaBid).\n\nMembers will be able to automate their 4 weekly spend to ensure that they are always automatically qualified e.g. buy 10 x MetaQuiz tickets every 4 weeks – this will be an opt-in and opt-out subscription and you can always do this manually if that is your preference.\n\nVote Discussion\n\nJoin the discussion on this proposal in the MetFi DAO Discord and head over to the #vote-discussion channel. \n\nProposal\n\nIf the community approves this proposal with a FOR vote – MetFier Rewards qualifiers will be deployed as outlined in this proposal and proposal #45 will be null and void.\n\nPlease vote FOR to approve this proposal or AGAINST to block this proposal.",

Today there are a number of inactive affiliates and wallets that continue to receive MetFier Rewards via automated smart contracts.\n\nAn inactive wallet is typically a wallet that a user cannot access due to losing their private keys and/or having their wallet compromised.\n\nMetFiers Rewards continue to be distributed to inactive wallets which means USDT is literally being thrown away and left on the table with no way of recovering them.\n\nMotivation\n\nThe intent is to reward MetFiers and wallets that are active and engaged and to divert MetFiers Rewards that are now been sent to inactive MetFiers and wallets to the treasury where they can be used for the benefit of the community. \n\nWe believe it is ‘fair play’ to reward MetFiers that are actively contributing to the growth of the DAO.\n\nHow It Works\n\nThe qualification criteria are as follows:\n\n1) Hold a Shrimp (or higher) NFT\n2) Generate a monthly minimum of 100 USDT of transactional activity from your wallet by:\no Upgrading your NFT\no Buying or gifting MetaQuiz tickets\no Buying or gifting MetaBid BIDs (see proposal 46)\no Gifting NFTs (including Plankton)\no Future product purchases and/or gifts.\n\nThe monthly cycle will be 4 weeks long and will start for everyone on the same date and time and there will be a countdown showing the remaining time and how much your wallet has generated and/or needs to generate for the month.\n \nQualifications will always be for the NEXT 4-week cycle.

      "content": "Proposal to deploy a new NFT.\n\nBackground\n\nCurrently, anyone participating in the NFT ecosystem needs to buy or be gifted an NFT valued at a minimum of 100 USDT (Shrimp). For some, this is more than they would like to spend when they are only just beginning to learn about MetFi.\n\nMetFiers are great at explaining the MetFi ecosystem to others but not everyone knows a MetFier.\n\nMotivation\n\nWe believe it would be beneficial to everyone if we lowered the barrier of entry to 10 USDT.\n\nThe new NFT will be upgradeable to Shrimp and above.\n\nYou can think of Plankton as a FREE user-only NFT primarily intended to make it easier for people that stumble across MetFi, hear of it on the grapevine, or click one of our future advertisements.\n\nIt will be called Plankton because it is the most abundant life form on earth and plays a crucial role in the marine food chain. Plankton provides a crucial source of food to many small and large sea creatures. Without plankton, there would be few living organisms on Earth.\n\nHow It Works\n\nThe Plankton NFT will be positioned in the Shrimp matrix the same way as any other Shrimp except it will not be able to earn any form of MetFier Rewards but it can hold METFI and receive Multiplier Rewards 1x same as a Shrimp. \n\nOne of the goals is to enable anyone to use MetFi products and stake METFI without becoming an affiliate. \n\nPlankton can generate MetFier Rewards for affiliates placed above it in the Shrimp matrix, namely NFT upgrades, buying MetaQuiz tickets, and BIDs (see proposal 46 MetaBid).\n\nPlankton is minted in the background when a wallet that is NOT holding an existing NFT:\n\n- Buys a MetaQuiz ticket,\n- Buys MetaBid BIDs (new product, see proposal 46),\n- Is gifted a MetaQuiz ticket or BIDs.\n\nIn short, Plankton is minted for FREE when a new wallet purchases or is gifted a MetFi product that is not a Shrimp or above.\n\nMetFiers can refer Plankton NFTs via their existing affiliate links and they will be permanently linked to the referrer, just as Shrimps are now.\n\nWhen gifting MetaQuiz or MetaBid tickets to an empty wallet (no NFT) the smart contract will automatically mint a free Plankton NFT to the wallet as your personal referral.\n\nPlankton NFTs can upgrade to higher NFTs and become full-blown MetFiers whenever they want.\n\nVote Discussion\nJoin the discussion on this proposal in the MetFi DAO Discord and head over to the #vote-discussion channel. \n\nProposal\n\nIf the community approves this proposal with a FOR vote – Plankton NFTs will be deployed as soon as possible.\n\nPlease vote FOR to approve this proposal or AGAINST to block this proposal.",

      "title": "MetaBid",
      "content": "Proposal to create and deploy MetaBid.\n\nBackground\n\nThe DAO is committed to adding new, innovative, value-creating, revenue-generating products with similar characteristics to MetaQuiz – namely fun and rewarding with the native ability for NFT owners to spend staked METFI that is recycled and burned.\n\nRecycling METFI helps ensure sustainable METFI Multiplier Rewards while burning METFI ensures increasingly less METFI supply.\n\nMotivation\n\nCreate a product that anyone in the world can engage with without needing to purchase a Shrimp (or higher) NFT, increasing the likelihood of mass adoption of the MetFi protocol. \n\nWhat is MetaBid?\n\nMetaBid is an auction platform that allows participants to purchase digital and physical products at a fraction of their retail price. For example, a user may be able to buy 1 x Bitcoin for a few USDT.\n\nHow It Works\n\nRegistering for MetaBid is as simple as connecting a DeFi wallet to the platform, or being gifted BIDs from an existing MetFier.\n\nBIDs are off-chain tokens that can only be used for bidding on auction items in MetaBid. \n\nBIDs can be purchased from the MetFi platform in a similar way to any other NFT or product. \n\nThe user does not need an active NFT to buy BIDs and participate in MetaBid – they simply need to purchase 10 BIDs for 10 USDT and a Plankton NFT will be minted for new users in the background (that they can later upgrade) – see proposal 43.\n\nUnused BIDs are non-transferable and expire after 6 months.\n\n1 BID costs 1 USDT.\n\nSimilar to MetaQuiz there will be volume discounts for purchasing BIDs in bulk and staked METFI can be used to buy BIDs exactly as you do now when buying MetaQuiz tickets.\n\nAt its core there will be two (2) auction formats:\n\n1.  Regular Auction\n2.  Reverse Auction\n\nIn regular auctions, each BID increases the price while in reverse auctions, each BID decreases the price. In both cases, the user that placed the last bid is the winner. If the product is physical the winner will pay for shipping and handling (delivery) of the item, digital products will be delivered instantly.\n\nSupercharge Your NFT\n\nTo be eligible to earn MetaBid Rewards (from BID purchases) and Supercharge Rewards a user must be a qualified MetFier (see proposal 45) and own a ‘Supercharged’ NFT. \n\nSupercharged NFTs are a one-time purchasing event and your NFT supercharge powers last forever – your powers are automatically assigned to your highest NFT so when you upgrade your NFT from say a Dolphin to a Shark the supercharge powers are bound to the Shark. \n\nSupercharged NFTs cost 1,000 USDT (one-time) and come with 100 BIDs.\n\nSupercharge Rewards\n\nWhen a user in any of your matrices supercharges their NFT for 1,000 USDT this is how those funds are handled by smart contracts:\n\n- 100 USDT is assigned to each of the 10 matrices and equally distributed 10 levels up, same as MetFier Rewards i.e. 100 x 10 = 1,000.\n\n-  if you do not own an NFT 10 Humpback when you supercharge your NFT the smart contracts will identify where your NFTs would be placed in each higher matrix if you upgraded to Humpback at that precise moment in time and equally distribute Supercharge Rewards to all eligible NFTs in those higher matrices. \n\nN.B: you will not have a position in those higher matrices until you upgrade to a higher NFT – this design feature was added to ensure that the maximum number of rewards will be distributed to as many MetFiers as possible when a Supercharged NFT is purchased. \n\n-  like MetFier Rewards you will only receive Supercharge Rewards on Supercharge NFTs that are in your 3 x 10 matrix e.g. if you are an NFT 6 Shark you can earn on up to 6 matrices.  \n\n-  Matching and Fast Start Rewards apply to Supercharge Rewards.\n\nMetaBid Rewards\n\nMetaBid Rewards are earned when BIDs are purchased in any of your matrices.\n \nMetaBid Rewards have the same structure as MetaQuiz Rewards whereby 50% of the proceeds from BID purchases are assigned to distribute member rewards while the other 50% goes to the MetaBid Pool to cover the cost of the auction items. \n\nMetaBid Rewards are always based on the highest NFT/matrix that purchased the BIDs so if you have a e.g. NFT 6 Shark in your matrix 1 you will not receive MetaBid Rewards for that purchase as all rewards will be distributed to matrix 6.  \n\nVote Discussion\n\nJoin the discussion on this proposal in the MetFi DAO Discord and head over to the #vote-discussion channel. \n\nProposal\n\nIf the community approves this proposal with a FOR vote – the MetaBid auction platform will be developed and deployed.\n\nPlease vote FOR to approve this proposal or AGAINST to block this proposal.",

      "title": "Star Achiever Rewards",
      "content": "Proposal to residually reward Star Rank Achievers for their contribution and loyalty each and every month.\n\nBackground\n\nEarlier this year we released [Influencer Star Rankings](https://docs.metfi.io/rewards/recognition-ranking) to acknowledge influencers for their achievements - there are 13 influencer ranks.\n\nThe ranks are determined by each MetFiers’ NFT level and lifetime income (excluding promotional bonuses e.g. LIFTOFF, MetaQuiz prizes, and Multiplier Rewards etc). \n\nEach rank is represented by a different Star Achiever NFT. \n\nWhile influencers retain all previous Star Achiever NFT ranks, they can only hold one rank at a time within the MetFi ecosystem i.e. the highest Star Achiever Rank NFT that they have minted. \n\nYou can view [your rank](https://app.metfi.io/ranks) and mint your Star Achiever NFT when you qualify for each new rank.\n\nISA Reward Pool Contract\n\nThe ISA Reward Pool holds all METFI that is allocated to pay ISA Rewards.\n \nThe ISA Rewards Pool is replenished through the METFI recycling mechanism. Each recycling event transfers 5% of the METFI tokens in the Recycling Pool to the ISA Reward Pool.\n\nThe [ISA Rewards Pool Contract](https://medium.com/@MetFi_DAO/metfi-token-mechanics-simplified-b7b6deb5f188) was deployed at the first halving on 5 April 2023. \n\nMotivation\n\nWe’ve received numerous requests from community members to attach a financial reward to the Influencer Star Achiever Program – so we designed it to be residual and sustainable so that influencers receive a new, permanent monthly income stream.\n\nInfluencer Star Achievers (ISA) Rewards\n\nIf this proposal passes ISA rewards would be distributed to all MetFi influencers that achieve and mint a 3-Star Rank NFT or above. \n\nThe rewards will be calculated at each halving and METFI will be allocated to the Star Achievers Pool Contract, beginning 5 October 2023 when a snapshot of ranks will be taken.\n\nOnce the snapshot is taken METFI in the Star Achievers Pool Contract is allocated to each influencer that holds an eligible rank for the next 6 months until the next halving and snapshot when the process happens all over again i.e. every 6 months ISA Rewards are recalculated for the next 6 months and so on.\n\nMETFI tokens are distributed FULLY UNLOCKED to the wallet of all eligible Star Achievers.\n\nISA Reward Allocations\n\nMETFI from the ISA Pool is allocated proportionally to each rank. As there are fewer MetFiers in the higher ranks they will be receiving a higher reward per influencer.\n\nFor example:\n\nLet's assume there are 770,000 METFI in the ISA pool at the time of the halving. \n\nWe have 11 eligible ranks (Ranks 1 & 2 are not eligible) so 770,000 / 11 = 70,000 so each of the 11 ranks is allocated 70,000 METFI. \n\nNow let’s assume there are:\n\n* 500 x 3-Star Achievers\n* 50 x 5-Star Achievers\n* 5 x 10-Star Achievers\n\nThe 70,000 allocated METFI for each rank is then divided by the number of achievers within that rank. In the previous example this would mean:\n\n* Each 3-Star Achiever receives 140 METFI\n* Each 5-Star Achiever receives 1,400 METFI\n* Each 10-Star Achiever receives 14,000 METFI\n\n**ISA Rewards Distribution**\n\nThe rewards allocations are distributed to the wallet holding the Rank NFT. \n\nThe rewards are distributed in 6 equal monthly tranches starting 30 days after the halving. The influencer will have 3 days to claim their METFI tokens from within the dApp. Unclaimed tokens go to the METFI Recycling Pool.\n\nIf there are no achievers in a particular rank at the snapshot, the tokens for that rank are immediately sent to the METFI Recycling Pool.\n\nFor example:\n\nThe next halving takes place on 5 October 2023 and you are a 5-Star Achiever at the time of the snapshot so you were allocated 1,400 METFI. \n\nYou will be able to claim 233.33 METFI (1,400 / 6) on 4 November, 4th of December, 3rd of January 2024, 2nd of February, 3rd of March, and 2nd of April respectively (every 30 days).\n\nIf you do not claim your METFI within 3 days they will be recycled and you will permanently lose your claim on them, however, you will be able to claim your reward for the following month.\n\nISA Pool Top Up\n\nThe Recycling Pool and Star Achievers (ISA) Pool hold very small balances of METFI as we have not had a lot of recycling events and we aren’t expecting huge recycling volume between now and the next halving in October. \n\nIt is for this reason that we propose topping up the ISA Pool with 150,000 METFI (one-time event) so that we can kick off ISA Rewards strongly and appropriately incentivize and reward active influencers.\n\n10% METFI Bonus\n\nFurthermore, it’s good for the community when ISA Rewards are staked.\n\nThis is why a 10% METFI bonus will be given to all Star Achievers when they stake their ISA Rewards to their NFT.\n\nThis means that 90% of the ISA Reward Pool is for ISA Rewards and 10% will be allocated for the METFI bonus. Unclaimed 10% METFI bonuses are sent to the Recycling Pool. \n\nEligibility\n\nIf you do not hold a minted 3-Star Achiever NFT (or above) prior to the block before the halving snapshot you will not be eligible for ISA Rewards for that halving and you will have to wait 6 months for your next opportunity.\n\nAll ISA Rewards are locked in at the time of the halving snapshot and cannot be changed until the next halving when a new snapshot is taken.\n\nIf you initiate the unstaking process or unstake your NFT you will not be eligible to claim ISA Rewards – your unclaimed reward is permanently lost and your unclaimed ISA Reward is sent to the Recycling Pool. \n\nThe claimed tokens are fully unlocked and there are no restrictions placed on them.\n\nVoting Options\n\nYou have 3 voting options:\n\n1)\tImplement ISA Rewards + 150k one-time METFI Top Up\n2)\tISA Rewards - NO top up\n3)\tNo ISA Rewards in any form\n\nVote Discussion\n\nJoin the discussion on this proposal in the MetFi DAO #vote-discussion channel on Discord. \n\nProposal\n\nIf the community approves this proposal with a FOR vote – the DAO will execute the ISA Reward Program per the communities wishes.\n\nPlease vote for options 1, 2, or 3.\n",

      "content": "Proposal for Certik to coordinate a bug bounty on all MetFi smart contracts.\n\nBackground\n\nOur smart contracts have been audited by Certik 3 times and passed with flying colors each time.\n\nYou can read all about the Certik bug bounty program here:\n\n•\t[Certik Bug Bounty Program](https://www.certik.com/products/bug-bounty)\n\n•\t[What is a Certik Web3 Bug Bounty](https://www.certik.com/resources/blog/what-is-a-web3-bug-bounty)\n\nTLDR: Certik has a community of trusted ethical hackers that will receive a reward (bounty) for finding bugs or exploits in any of our smart contracts. If none are found the ethical hackers are not paid so they have a serious incentive to find them.\n\nMotivation\n\nBug bounties are best practices for companies in fields such as banking, insurance, and technology, in fact, most large organizations, if not all conduct bug bounty programs from time to time as do many DAOs and other Web3 protocols.  \n\nThis program has the potential to make our smart contracts and ecosystem more secure than it already is (if any bugs are found). \n\nOur Certik security score would improve and we will have a bug bounty section added to our [Certik page](https://skynet.certik.com/projects/metfi) similar to Shentu, click this link and then click the [Bug Bounty](https://skynet.certik.com/projects/shentu) tab to get an idea of how this section would look on our Certik page.\n\nCosts\n\nCertik Fee – 5,000 USDT\n\nWe propose these four (4) bug bounty rewards with the severity level of each bug determining the reward.\n\n1)\tCritical Severity – up to 50,000 USDT\n2)\tMajor Severity – up to 3,000 USDT\n3)\tMedium Severity – up to 500 USDT\n4)\tMinor Severity – up to 200 USDT\n\nN.B: 50,000 may seem like a lot of money to pay however the ethical hacker would need to find a critical bug to receive that reward and a critical bug could cost the DAO a lot more than 50,000 USDT if it was discovered by a bad actor so we think it wise to run the program, identify potential exploits and improve our Certik score.\n\nProposal\n\nPay Certik 5,000 USDT to push the MetFi Bug Bounty program to their community of ethical hackers and approve the bounty fee structure in the rewards table above.\n\nIf no bugs are found the only cost is the 5,000 USDT Certik fee.\n\nVoting Options\n\nYou have 2 options:\n\n1) FOR - approve Certik Bug Bounty and Rewards Program\n2) AGAINST - deny Certik Bug Bounty and Rewards Program\n\nThe developers strongly recommend FOR, option 1.\n\nVote Discussion\n\nJoin the discussion on this proposal in the MetFi DAO [Discord](https://discord.gg/R8Ekv6yxK9) and head over to the #vote-discussion channel. \n\nVote\n\nPlease vote FOR to approve this proposal or AGAINST to reject it.\n",

      "title": "BNB Liquidity Lock",
      "content": "Proposal to lock our BNB liquidity pool.\n\nBackground\n\nThe DAO locked it’s [old BUSD liquidity pool for 5 years](https://medium.com/@MetFi_DAO/metfi-locks-2-5m-lp-tokens-for-5-years-d788931b8806) on June 9, 2022.\n\nOn February 13th, 2023, Paxos [released a statement](https://paxos.com/2023/02/13/paxos-issues-statement) confirming that they would cease fully supporting the BUSD stablecoin, this required MetFi DAO to switch to USDT, drain the old BUSD liquidity pool, issue the METFI v2 token and while we were at it give the protocol a great upgrade.\n\nMultiSig, Treasury Lock and Veto Button\n\nWe already have strong security in place with our [MultiSig Dashboard](https://multisig.metfi.io) whereby all transactions must be signed by a majority of the [Daily Task Force](https://docs.metfi.io/governance/daily-task-force) (DTF) wallets for the transaction to even be scheduled.\n\nOnce scheduled the transaction is automatically visible on the MultiSig Dashboard, behind a 48-hour time lock so that the world has 48-hours’ notice of the transaction with the community having the ability to [veto/stop any transaction](https://docs.metfi.io/treasury/time-lock) they don’t want to leave the treasury.\n\nIf the transaction is not vetoed it is sent when the 48 hours has elapsed.  \n \nMotivation\n\nLocking liquidity is an added layer of security as it ensures that there will always be a liquidity pool to buy and sell METFI tokens while the pool is locked – this gives existing METFI token and NFT holders, and the entire crypto community a lot more confidence in MetFi DAO.\n\nFurther, many of the websites and apps tracking METFI will display an icon or message confirming that our liquidity is locked, how much is locked and for how long which would significantly strengthen our confidence scores, including our Certik score.\n\nRisks\n\nWhile there are some risks with locking our liquidity we believe that the benefits above outweigh any potential risks.\n\nLocking a stablecoin (USDT) for 5 years (again) isn’t a feasible option as a lot can happen in less than a year, never mind 5 years.\n\nLocking our METFI/BNB LP tokens for 2 years makes the most sense as BNB is the only token that BNB Chain cannot function without so it would probably take the closure of the entire Binance blockchain for us to run into any troubles with BNB.  \n\nProposal\n\nLock 100% of our METFI/BNB LP tokens for 2 years, valued at approx. 1 Million USDT today (500,000 BNB USDT value).\n\nVoting Options\n\nYou have 3 options:\n\n1) Lock BNB Pool - all other liquidity remains under 48-hour MultiSig + Veto lockup.\n\n2) Lock All Liquidity - no flexibility if anything happens to the tokens in the pool pair.\n\n3) No Liquidity Lock - leave everything as is.\n\nThe developers strongly recommend option 1, locking 100% of the BNB pool and leaving all other liquidity flexible and secure under 48-hour MultiSig + Veto lockup.\n\nVote Discussion\n\nJoin the discussion on this proposal in the MetFi DAO [Discord](https://discord.gg/R8Ekv6yxK9) and head over to the #vote-discussion channel. \n\nVote\n\nPlease vote 1 to 3.\n",

      "title": "MultiSig Time Lock",
      "content": "Proposal to temporarily remove the 48-hour multisig time lock. \n\nOverview\n\nMultisig time lock was enabled last year as a security feature. Meaning that each system transaction requires multiple signatures and after all parties sign the transaction it takes another 48 hours for it to be executed. \n\nThe community approved a significant upgrade to the platform some months ago and this deployment is earmarked for next week, tentatively between 4-7 April.\n\nDeploying the MetFi platform next week requires hundreds of transactions to be executed one after the other in a specific sequence and each one of them will be under a 48-hour multisig time lock meaning it would take years to deploy all of these transactions - we don’t think the community wants to wait years for MetFi v2.\n\nThe developers have prepared 25 scripts that need to run consecutively and are dependent on each other. It is impossible to do these upgrades with a 48-hour lockup between each of the hundreds of transactions this year so it’s best to temporarily remove it. \n\nDuring this deployment, the multisig platform itself will be redeployed to integrate the Veto button which gives the MetFi community the ability to veto/stop any multisig transaction in the future. \n\nThe whole deployment process is expected to take approx. 30 to 60 minutes which is a lot faster than years with 48-hour time lock delays - during this 30–60-minute deployment window, the platform will not be accessible.\n\nSo today we are seeking your permission to temporarily remove the 48-hour time lock so that we can upgrade to MetFi v2 quickly and efficiently. \n\nSeeing that our deployment may happen as soon as the 4th of April today is the last day to initiate this vote if we want to be ready to deploy on the 4th. \nThis vote will run for 3 days and after the vote, the removal of the 48-hour time lock needs a transaction that itself is subject to the 48-hour time lock. This means the earliest the lock can be removed is 5 days after this vote proposal was posted. \n\nAfter MetFi v2 is deployed, the 48-hour time lock will be reinstated and additionally secured with the Veto button that the community can use to stop any transactions or parameter changes, or MetFi smart contracts from executing.\n\nVote Discussion\n\nJoin the discussion on this proposal in the MetFi DAO [Discord]( https://discord.gg/R8Ekv6yxK9) and head over to the #vote-discussion channel. \n\nProposal\n\nIf the community approves this proposal with a FOR vote:\n\n•\t48-hour time lock will be temporarily removed to allow the developers to deploy all of the smart contracts in a timely manner,\n•\t48-hour time lock will be reinstated once they have deployed the code with a Veto button.\n\nPlease vote FOR to approve this proposal or AGAINST to block this proposal.\n",

      "content": "Proposal to implement the roadmap. \n\nBackground\n\nDue to recent market developments, we needed to spend most of February planning the switch away from the BUSD stablecoin as well as fixing the supply of MFI and introducing halvings as these tasks are the most time-sensitive.\n\nThis meant that the treasury claims module was set to the side which is fine seeing that we do not have any fully vested treasury assets to release at this time. We need to give these projects and assets a little more time to mature and when they do we can start releasing these assets to MetFiers who will be able to secure them in exchange for some of their staked MFI.\n\nTo date, we have been developing the ecosystem at an extremely fast pace and we think it’s time to slow down the new feature rollouts a little bit and use that time to conduct more testing and optimize the user experience.\n\nFor security, we also want to have the code audited before new functionalities go live. This means that development times will be a little longer than what we have been used to and while the schedule remains relatively aggressive the end product and user experience will be much better if this proposal is approved.  \n\nRoadmap\n\nWith all of this in mind, we propose the following roadmap:\n\nMarch\n\n* BUSD to USDT switch\n* Fixed MFI supply (coding)\n* Halving MFI distribution (coding)\n* Recycling MFI (coding)\n* Veto button of any treasury transaction\n* Certik Audit \n\nApril\n\n* Fixed MFI supply implementation – after audit\n* Halving MFI implementation – after audit\n* Recycling MFI implementation – after audit\n* CEX Listing – after audit\n* MetaQuiz product launch\n* Testing and optimizations\n \nMay\n\n* Marketplace update with historical sales information\n\nJune\n\n* Full UX (user experience) redesign\n* Onboarding Wizard - potentially with direct credit card payment integration, depending on the regulatory onramp environment\n\nJuly\n\n* Treasury Claims – swap staked MFI for treasury assets\n\nAugust\n\n* New Web3 project proposal and onboarding app with community features and feedback\n\nSeptember\n\n* Testing and optimizations\n\nOctober\n\n* Loan Offers added to the lending platform\n\nN.B: There are other ideas in the works that we will be presenting along the way.\n\nVote Discussion\n\nJoin the discussion on this proposal in the MetFi DAO [Discord]( https://discord.gg/R8Ekv6yxK9) and head over to the #vote-discussion channel. \n\nProposal\n\nIf the community approves this proposal with a FOR vote we will implement this roadmap. \n\nPlease vote FOR to approve this proposal or AGAINST to block this proposal.\n",

There are no insiders in MetFi, no VC, no ecosystem fund, and no marketing tokens. \n\nThe value of a project is equal to the number of tokens times the token price.\n \nIf you believe MetFi is a high-value project, then fewer tokens equate to a higher MFI price. \n\nWe are aiming to limit supply and add deflationary mechanisms that limit the supply at regular intervals.\n\nTokenomics Enhancement\n\nFor faster growth we propose:\n\n1.\tLimiting the total supply of MFI ever in existence to 500,000 tokens,\n2.\tHalving the base rate of the MFI rewards every 6 months,\n3.\tBurning 10% of all the tokens that will not be needed to payout MFI Multiplier rewards,\n4.\tBurning 10% of all the fees payable in MFI (unstaking, lending, all new products to come) – with burning to reduce the tokens in existence (not the rewards),\n5.\tRecycling the other 90% back to pay MFI Multiplier rewards from the 6th halving onwards so MetFiers always receive high staking rewards.\n\nAll of the unburned 500,000 tokens will be distributed directly to NFT owners through the staking contracts with the minimal exception of any liquidity that may need to be provided so that the MFI token remains tradable at all points in time and the community must approve this via a vote as needed.\n\nVote Discussion\n\nJoin the discussion on this proposal in the MetFi DAO [Discord]( https://discord.gg/R8Ekv6yxK9) and head over to the #vote-discussion channel. \n\nProposal\n\nIf the community approves this proposal with a FOR vote – we will execute points 1 to 5 above.  \n\nThis is a proposal and it is totally up to the MetFi community to approve this enhancement or stick to the old plan.\n\nPlease vote FOR to approve this proposal or AGAINST to block this proposal.\n",

      "content": "Proposal to invest in The Sandbox.\n\nBackground\n\nThere has been significant community interest in this project so please vote on whether or not MetFi DAO invests in The Sandbox and on the amount that should be invested.\n\nLands & Estates\n\nThe Sandbox metaverse consists of 166,464 LANDs that are each 96 meters long and 96 meters wide, a perfect square, and 128 meters high. \n\nLANDs that are directly next to each other can be joined to form an Estate. For example, nine 1x1 LANDs that are directly next to each other can be merged to form one 2x2 estate, and so on. \n\nThere are 4 Estate sizes:\n\n•\tSmall - 3x3 – nine LANDs\n•\tMedium - 6x6 – 36 LANDs\n•\tLarge - 12x12 – 144 LANDs\n•\tX-Large - 24x24 – 576 LANDs. \n\nLarger estates are incredibly difficult to create as the majority of Sandbox land releases are sold as individual LAND so it takes time, money, and a lot of luck to create a large estate by buying the surrounding lands as you need the adjoining land owners to sell at a fair price.\n\nIf your goal is a 24x24 estate you need to own 576 adjoining LANDs to create one 24x24 estate so if just one LAND owner won’t sell or is asking too much you could be left with a 12x12 estate at best so we don’t think buying LAND one at a time is a wise strategy under these circumstances.\n\nThere are only thirty-five 24x24 X-Large Estates in the entire Sandbox Metaverse – The Sandbox sold each of them as a 24x24 estate package so they are super rare. \n\nMetFi DAO would like to own one 24x24 Estate and build a world-class MetFi gaming experience inside of it and be one of only 35 X-Large estate owners.\n\nDuring the last bull run, a 24x24 Estate sold for millions of BUSD value and we would like to buy one now for under 1 Million BUSD value or 750 ETH or less to be more precise. \n\nIf approved, our DAO will own the largest metaverse inside The Sandbox which opens up enormous opportunities for the community, and our project as we will be very hard to miss inside The Sandbox, and casual visitors will be more likely to enter our metaverse to see what’s going on inside the MetFi DAO metaverse.\n\nAll Sandbox land will be proportionally owned by the community and held in the treasury. \n\nInvestment Options\n\nThere are 4 x ETH investment options:\n\n* 750 ETH\n* 500 - ETH\n* 250 ETH\n* 0 ETH - no investment\n\nVote Discussion\n\nJoin the discussion on this proposal in the MetFi DAO [Discord](https://discord.gg/R8Ekv6yxK9) and go to the #sandbox channel.\n\nProposal\nVote on the amount of ETH that the treasury should spend on a Sandbox estate.\n",

It would allow anyone to read the code which will give the crypto community a new level of comfort and motivation to buy our token and NFTs. It would also increase the likelihood of our DAO forming higher-level strategic partnerships faster.\n\n**Vote Discussion**\n\nJoin the discussion on this proposal in our [Discord](https://discord.gg/R8Ekv6yxK9) and go to the #vote-discussion channel.\n\n**Proposal**\n\nIf the community approves this proposal with a **FOR** vote the DAO will publish all but one set of our smart contracts on our [GitHub](https://github.com/metfi).\n\nPlease vote **FOR** to **approve** this proposal or **AGAINST** to **block** this proposal from passing.",

      "content": "Proposal to allocate up to 50% of treasury value towards purchasing A-Grade cryptocurrencies.\n\n**Background**\n\nWe are in the final stages of evaluating the next potential project investment that we hope to be sharing with you soon.\n\nWe are experiencing good deal flow however we are not seeing many potential early-stage unicorn projects that are ticking all of the boxes and preparing to launch during this bear market.\n\nThe treasury is sitting on approximately 3.1 million BUSD that we can hedge and put to work for the DAO while we wait for future project investments.\n\n**Motivation**\n\nThe market has been presenting us with many trading opportunities of A-grade tokens that we are not capitalizing on. Giving the DTF the ability to buy the dips and sell the highs (trade) would give the treasury the ability to grow in value while we continue to evaluate potential project investments.\n\n**Use of Funds**\n\nNo risky trades will be executed and only if strong buying and selling signals present themselves.\n\nThe entire 50% of treasury value will not be exchanged on any single trade or in a short period of time but rather over a longer time period with a conservative and appropriate allocation for each trade.\n\nThe DTF may also choose to allocate a portion of the treasury BUSD to dollar-cost average into tokens such as BTC, ETH, BNB, and other A-Grade tokens with a strong likelihood of delivering long-term returns to the treasury even in the event of a short-term market downturn.\n\n**Vote Discussion**\n\nJoin the discussion on this proposal in the MetFi DAO [Discord](https://discord.gg/R8Ekv6yxK9) and go to the **#vote-discussion** channel.\n\n**Proposal**\n\nIf the community approves this proposal with a **FOR** vote the DTF will have the freedom to exchange no more than 50% of treasury value towards trading and DCAing into A-Grade cryptocurrencies.\n\nPlease vote **FOR** to **approve** this proposal or **AGAINST** to **block** this proposal from passing.",

      "title": "Website Blocking",
      "content": "Proposal to block users from accessing the website within US states and territories while regulatory uncertainties in the jurisdiction prevail.\n\n**Background**\n\nSenators Cynthia Lummis and Kirsten Gillibrand introduced a new bill, the Responsible Financial Innovation Act (RFIA) in the US Senate on June 7, 2022. This is a comprehensive federal bill intended to strongly regulate the cryptocurrency sector in US states and territories.\n\nUnder Section 204 of the RFIA, all  DAOs would be considered business entities for purposes of taxation and would need to be incorporated as a business or organized under the laws of a jurisdiction. Section 205 would regulate Lending and Section 208 would regulate Staking.\n\nSome responsible, well-thought-out legislation that fosters genuine innovation could be very positive for the sector but there are no guarantees that this is what the introduced bill will deliver. The reality is that a significant cloud of uncertainty regarding DAOs and the US crypto sector will remain until the US passes the bill into law.\n\nIt’s interesting to note that the bill would determine stablecoins issued by a bank or credit union as neither a commodity nor security and that the Federal Reserve Bank will be responsible for issuing routing transaction numbers to the banks and credit unions, essentially giving all US banks and credit unions the green light to issue their own stablecoins via the Federal Reserve Bank which would result in greater centralization of the crypto sector by the same institutions that control the traditional centralized financial sector today.\n\n**Motivation**\n\nThe lack of regulatory clarity and the significance of this bill makes it very difficult for MetFi to plan even weeks or months into the future and MetFi wants to keep building and protect the community and the project from regulatory uncertainty.\n\n**Recommendation**\n\nBlock users within US states and territories from accessing the website and app until this bill is passed so that we can all review and reassess the legislation and regulatory framework upon its release.\n\n\n**Vote Discussion**\n\nJoin the discussion on this proposal in the MetFi DAO [Discord](https://discord.gg/R8Ekv6yxK9) and go to the **#vote-discussion** channel.\n\n**Proposal**\n\nIf the community approves this proposal with a FOR vote MetFi DAO will block users from accessing the website and app within US states and territories.\n\nPlease vote **FOR** to **approve** this proposal or **AGAINST** to **block** this proposal from passing.",

It would also be very beneficial to develop a suite of standardized marketing tools including overview videos and guides with **professional voiceovers** that all community members can utilize.\n\nIndividuals can continue to create their own marketing tools but it is important to have a suite of tools that **everyone can use** inside the app.\n\nDeploying these marketing tools and campaigns should result in significant growth for MetFi DAO via increased, multi-platform content distribution leading to stronger brand awareness, more powerful and consistent messaging, and more effective sharing of our vision with more people, faster.\n\n**Scope**\n\nThe agency will deliver a suite of marketing tools such as **high-quality graphics, videos with professional voiceovers, written content**, etc. that will be made available to all MetFiers so that they can share the content freely with their audiences.\n\n**Use of Funds**\n\nFunds will be spent as follows:\n\n**Agency** – outsource certain branding, marketing tasks, campaigns, and responsibilities to a professional crypto marketing agency.\n\n**Strategy** – agency delivers a branding and marketing strategy including the tools that will be created for the DAO.\n\n**KPIs** – MetFi and the agency will define and agree on the KPIs that will be used to measure the quality of the marketing tools and the success of the campaigns.\n\n**Sign-Off** – MetFi and the agency agree to the terms.\n\n**Execution** – agency executes the strategy and delivers the marketing tools that will be created.\n\n**Measuring** – MetFi will measure the KPIs to ensure that the tools and the strategy are successfully executed and achieve the desired outcomes.\n\n**Budget**  \n\nWe are seeking approval for up to **100,000 BUSD for a one-time upfront marketing fund** so that we can kick-start the process with a bang by having a number of different tools developed at the same time with a key initial focus on branding, positioning, storyboards, videos, and graphics that professionally, clearly and effectively communicate our mission and vision, including the benefits of owning MetFi NFTs and the MFI token.\n\nPlus a maximum monthly budget of **20,000 BUSD** to create more tools and execute future campaigns as we need them – **all unused BUSD will remain in the treasury and not be spent**.\n\nN.B: We do not expect that this budget will need to be increased for some time but if we do experience significant growth and find a genuine use case for increasing this budget we will seek your approval at that time.\n\n**Vote Discussion**\n\nJoin the discussion on this proposal in the MetFi DAO [Discord](https://discord.gg/R8Ekv6yxK9) and go to the **#vote-discussion** channel.\n\n**Proposal**\n\nIf the community approves this proposal with a **FOR** vote MetFi DAO will onboard a marketing agency that will develop our new marketing tools for no more than **100,000 BUSD** plus a maximum of **20,000 BUSD** per month which will be used to create marketing tools and implement the aforementioned marketing strategy.\n\nPlease vote **FOR** to **approve** this proposal or **AGAINST** to **block** this proposal from passing.",

      "content": "MetFi DAO wishes to explore opportunities for listing the MFI token on centralized exchanges.\n\n**Motivation**\n\nMFI can only be purchased in the MetFi app and on Pancake Swap which is a decentralized exchange (DEX). \n\nA user needs to create an account using a DeFi wallet such as MetaMask, add the Binance SmartChain network, import the BUSD token address, and fund it with BNB and BUSD to buy the MFI token.\n\nThis can be a challenging experience for people that are relatively new to crypto and in extreme cases, it can be a barrier to entry – and one that will be removed if you approve this proposal.\n\nCentralized exchanges make it much easier for people to buy tokens because the CEX does almost all of the work for you. Users create an account and fund it with fiat or crypto, they do not need to create wallets, securely store seed phrases, etc.  \n  \nMany people already have a CEX account with tokens in it which they can easily exchange for MFI with just a few clicks and CEXs are the starting point for most people buying crypto for the first time and seeing that MetFi intends to become mainstream it is important to be in front of a wider audience.\n\nCEXs create the majority of all trading volume and trading volume provides more robust price stability that is less susceptible to price volatility.\n\nWe already have one CEX listing approved but we are still in negotiations with T1 and T2 CEXs as we looking for the best deal and best fit for MetFi – we have been quietly working on a CEX listing for some time and we are seeking your pre-approval for funding so that we can move swiftly when we are ready to execute a CEX listing.\n\nFinally, the crypto market will view MetFi and MFI more seriously and token trackers such as CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko will receive more accurate trading volume data for their reporting.\n\n**Use of Funds**\n\nFunds will be used in two ways.\n\n**CEXs** – listing fee for CEXs to integrate MFI on their exchanges and payment for their marketing services to promote MFI to their customer base and the wider crypto market so that we get traders engaging with our token on CEXs.  \n  \n**Market Makers** – we incentivize market makers to manage the order books of the CEXs, this is standard industry practice. Treasury funds are used to provide liquidity as market makers need our liquidity to buy and sell the MFI token i.e. they make the initial market for MFI on CEXs.  \n  \nThe treasury owns **100% of the liquidity that it will provide at all times** and the treasury earns fees from the trading of MFI on CEXs.\n\n**Budget**  \n\nWe are seeking a maximum budget allocation of 300,000 BUSD – all unused BUSD will be returned to the treasury.\n\n**Vote Discussion**\n\nJoin the discussion on this proposal in the MetFi DAO [Discord](https://discord.gg/R8Ekv6yxK9) and go to the #vote-discussion channel.\n\n**Proposal**\n\nIf the community approves this proposal with a FOR vote. MetFi DAO will allocate 300,000 BUSD for CEX listings and market maker fees and not spend any of these for any other purpose.\n\nPlease vote **FOR** to **approve** this proposal or **AGAINST** to **block** this proposal from passing.",

      "content": "MetFi DAO is seeking your approval to invest in the Big Time Metaverse.\n\n**Background**\n\nWe held a community AMA with the Big Time Chief Marketing Officer, and the Director of Growth and Marketing on August 4th, 2022. The community asked them questions that they answered and seeing that there seems to be significant community interest in this project you are cordially invited to vote on whether or not MetFi DAO invests in Big Time and on the amount that should be invested.\n\n  \n**Assets**\n\nThe asset that we would be buying is SPACE which you can think of as a finite supply of land inside the Big Time Metaverse. Similar to real estate, we could rent undeveloped/raw SPACE to a 3rd party or we could develop SPACE and rent it to a 3rd party, possibly at a higher value after development.\n\nSPACE will be a critical resource in gaining exposure to the Big Time token that will be released later this year when the game moves into Beta. SPACE is Big Time’s #1 and most prized asset at this time.\n\nMetFi may wish to form a Guild where players and entities can link assets to form a powerful alliance that plays Big Time, collecting NFTs and token rewards that our treasury will share with guild players.\n\nAll NFTs and tokens that MetFi collects will be owned by the community and held in the treasury and there will be a way for MetFi NFT owners to realize profits from this investment at a later date.  \n\n\n**Investment Options**\n\nThe treasury is holding close to $5.5 Million USD value at the time of writing.\n\nThere are 4 investment options:\n\n$500,000 of SPACE plus Ruby Passes for ALL MetFi NFT owners.\n\n$250,000 of SPACE plus 20 Ruby Passes for MetFi NFT owners.\n\n$100,000 of SPACE plus 10 Ruby Passes for MetFi NFT owners.\n\n$0 – no SPACE, no Ruby Passes.\n\n**Vote Discussion**\n\nJoin the discussion on this proposal in the MetFi DAO [Discord](https://discord.gg/R8Ekv6yxK9) and go to the **#big-time channel**.\n\n**Proposal**\n\nVote on the $ amount of treasury funds that you want our DAO to invest in Big Time SPACE.\n\n$500,000\n\n$250,000\n\n$100,000\n\nNo Investment",

      "title": "Community Manager Smart Contract and Budget",
      "content": "MetFi DAO wishes to deploy a smart contract to handle monthly payments to Community Managers of its Telegram and Discord channels. It is also seeking a maximum monthly payment budget.\n\n\n## Background\nWe have been training and trialing community managers since early July. \n\nWe have settled on the initial team and we now wish to deploy a smart contract to handle payments as it is the most efficient, safest, secure, and transparent payment method for MetFi.\n\nWe are seeking a maximum monthly budget of **10,000** BUSD but we do not expect to spend anywhere near that amount in the first few months even though we expect MetFi to double in size in the next few months.\n\nWe are intentionally asking for more budget than we presently need so that we have the flexibility to increase managers’ hours and/or incentivize them, and/or recruit new managers without having to post another vote proposal to increase the budget. \n\nIf we recommend increasing the 10,000 BUSD budget in the future you will be updated on the reasons why and it will be put to another community vote.  \n  \nMost managers will initially work an 8-hour shift each day and their hours can be increased when we have more community demand. They will use the next weeks and months to serve the community and prepare for the growth that we expect to come.\n\n## Budget & Process\n\nThe smart contract will have restrictions placed on it so that in the unlikely event of an internal or external exploit no more than 10,000 BUSD could be spent in any given month.  \n  \nThe smart contract can request (call) a maximum of 10,000 BUSD from the treasury every 27 days.  \n  \nWhen payments to the managers are due the smart contract will make a call to the treasury for the total payment amount. The treasury then sends the requested BUSD to the smart contract wallet. The smart contract then sends the precise amount of BUSD to each community manager’s nominated wallet.  \n  \nThe treasury will only send what it is asked to send, up at a **maximum** of **10,000 BUSD every 27 days**. \n\nIf the call is for e.g. 6,000 BUSD that is exactly what the treasury will send and the treasury will retain the remaining 4,000 BUSD.\n\n## Use of Funds\n\n**NFTs** – each manager will be gifted **100** BUSD that they will spend to buy a **Shrimp NFT** because they each need full access to the MetFi app to perform their roles for the community. This is a one-time event for these managers, not a regular monthly event and they will provide evidence of their purchase.  \n  \n**BUSD** – the treasury will send BUSD to each manager’s nominated wallet for the hours that they have worked in the preceding month.  \n  \n**July Payment**\n\nThe total payment for work performed in **July** will be **6,351.80** BUSD.  \n  \nJuly is higher than the estimated budget for August because of the fund allocation for their NFTs.  \n  \nFurthermore, some managers worked more than 8-hour shifts at times because they started on different dates and some of the early trial managers worked more hours while there were fewer hands on deck.  \n  \nWe also wanted to fast-track their development so some of them spent more hours in training during the trial.  \n  \nFinally, one manager didn’t make the final team but that person did some very good work and may be added to the team at a later date and we want to acknowledge that effort.  \n  \n**August Payment - Estimated**\n\n**5,108.80** BUSD\n\n## Vote Discussion \n\nJoin the discussion on this proposal in the MetFi DAO [Discord](https://discord.gg/R8Ekv6yxK9) and go to the #vote-discussion channel.\n\n## Proposal\n\nIf the community approves this proposal with a **FOR** vote. \n\nMetFi DAO will deploy the smart contract and spend a maximum of 10,000 BUSD every 27 days to pay the salaries of its community managers.\n\nPlease vote **FOR** to **approve** this proposal or **AGAINST** to **block** this proposal from passing.",

      "title": "Burn 100% MetFi DAO MFI Tokens",
      "content": "MetFi DAO wants to burn **100% of the MFI tokens** that are staked to the DAO NFT #10 Humpback. At the time of writing, this is 146,963 MFI tokens valued at **$780 Million USD** and **96.21%** of the total MFI supply.  \n  \nIf 96% of all MFI tokens are burned it **may well be the largest single burn by the percentage of supply in crypto history** and **certainly one of the largest by total value.**\n\n\n## Motivations & Benefits\n\nBurning 100% of the DAOs MFI tokens will give the community and the world an accurate circulating supply and a realistic market capitalization of the MFI token. \n\nIt will also see much fewer MFI tokens being minted or bought from the liquidity pool at rebasing events as there will be no MFI tokens staked to the DAO NFT #10 Humpback and therefore no APY to generate for it.\n\nZero DAO MFI tokens mean they cannot be sold, traded, or used to vote on and influence proposals – which for the record has never occurred in the past as the code prevents this and this was intentionally baked into the code from the start.\n\nThe **community loses nothing** after the MFI are burned as they can never be used for anything.\n\nToken burns are usually followed by an increase in token price however the DAO is explicitly not making any price predictions as the market will always decide the price of the MFI token via simple supply and demand mechanics.\n\nThis proposal and the burning event should give the community significant confidence and great trust in the DAO as these tokens are valued at **780 Million BUSD** and they could be worth a lot more in future but the **DAO wants to burn every last one of them.**\n\n## Background\n\nThe DAO NFT holds 146,963 MFI tokens and that number increases every 12 hours at rebasing events, generating 1000% APY. These MFI tokens can never be spent or sold by the DAO but they can be burned and that is what the DAO is now proposing.\n\nYou may recall that MetFi DAO spent 102,300 BUSD buying additional MFI tokens that were staked to the DAO NFT #10 Humpback when the protocol was launched. That was done for two reasons:  \n  \n1. Never ask others to do something that you are not willing to do, and,\n\n2. Implement the optimal staking strategy from the very beginning, knowing full well that the MFI tokens that were purchased could never be spent, were essentially useless, and would ultimately be burned.\n\n**Now is the time to burn 100% of the DAOs MFI tokens.**\n\n## Vote Discussion\n\nJoin the discussion on this proposal in the MetFi DAO [Discord](https://discord.gg/R8Ekv6yxK9) and go to the #vote-discussion channel.\n\n## Proposal\n\nIf the community approves this proposal with a FOR vote. MetFi DAO will burn 100% of the MFI tokens that are staked to the DAO NFT and it will not generate APY moving forward.\n\nPlease vote **FOR** to **approve** this proposal or **AGAINST** to **block** this proposal.",

      "title": "Certik Audit of MetFi DAOs Smart Contracts",
      "content": "MetFi DAO wants Certik to conduct a full audit of all its smart contracts.\n\n\n## Motivations & Benefits\n\nHaving all of MetFi DAOs smart contracts audited by Certik makes sense for multiple reasons, including but not limited to:\n\n 1. Certik will verify the correctness of the smart contracts, identify bugs, errors, and risks and deliver the DAO with a custom report on how to remediate any vulnerabilities that it finds.\n 2. Once the audit is successful MetFi DAO will be listed on the CertiK Security Leaderboard that is shared publicly with the entire crypto community. The Leaderboard contains the details of the project alongside their audit reports, as well as the community’s security sentiment of the project. This will give MetFi greater exposure to the entire crypto community and an enhanced reputation and trustworthiness within it.\n 3. Certik is a USA company and one of the most trusted and experienced blockchain and smart contract auditors in the world having conducted over 1,800 audits and are recommended by Binance, OKEx, and Huobi.\n 4. MetFi DAO has been transparent from the start and will continue to be. It made a commitment to you – this is one step on that journey.\n 5. The crypto community is more likely to participate in and support MetFi after the audit.\n\n## Risks\n\nThere is an element of risk in allowing Certik to view the code – but Certik already has the code and has a great reputation and the benefits of the audit should outweigh the risk.\n\n**N.B**: this is NOT a vote to make the code public, that would require a separate vote and that would not occur before the audit is completed.\n\n## Cost & Timeframe\n\n**Cost**: **$60,000** USD value paid to a Certik crypto wallet\n\n**Timeframe**: approximately **1 month** after payment\n\n## Vote Discussion\n\nJoin the discussion on this proposal in the MetFi DAO [Discord](https://discord.gg/R8Ekv6yxK9) and go to the #vote-discussion channel.\n\n## Proposal\n\nIf the community approves this proposal with a FOR vote.

      "title": "Gather & Appraise Smart Contract Audit Proposals",
      "content": "MetFi DAO wants to gather and appraise smart contract audit proposals from the world’s most respected and trusted smart contract auditors.\n\n## Motivation\n\nFrom the very beginning, MetFi DAO has openly and honestly stated that the community will decide when the DAOs smart contracts will be audited. The DAO fully intends to honor that commitment (and all other commitments) so now seems to be a good time as any to initiate that process by gathering and appraising audit proposals that will be shared with the community.  \n  \nIt is of critical importance, now and forever, that the community is armed with all of the information that it needs to cast informed votes. It is also of critical importance that the community and the broader crypto sector have confidence in the MetFi ecosystem. Having the smart contracts audited is an important step in that direction.\n\n## Risks\n\nAs stated in the whitepaper, there is always an element of risk in allowing 3rd parties to view the code, even more so when the code is so ground-breaking and revolutionary – as one of the largest smart contract deployments in blockchain history, the smart contracts contain an enormous amount of intellectual property (IP), that took hundreds of thousands of hours to plan and encapsulate in code – the MetFi community owns and controls not just the code but the entire MetFi ecosystem and its direction.\n\nThe code will need to be shared with auditors for them to present their proposals. For this reason, only auditors in a reputable jurisdiction and a great reputation will be considered and sent the code. The fewer auditors that see the code the better.\n\nOnce the code is in the public domain, a developer can fork and deploy a copycat of MetFi DAO - the DAO anticipates that many forks will be deployed within 1-2 months of its public release so striking the optimal balance between transparency and trust is key.\n\n**N.B:** This is NOT a vote to decide if the smart contracts will be made public, and it is not a vote to pay for and proceed with the audit - the DAO merely wants to gather audit proposals at this stage.\n\n## Process\n\nAll community members are invited to submit the website link and the name of an auditor that they believe is a suitable candidate in the #auditor-suggestion channel on Discord - this channel will only be created if/after this proposal has been approved.\n\nEach candidate that you submit will be reviewed and analyzed and the best candidates will be added to a shortlist. The DAO will contact each of them separately to see if they are interested in submitting a proposal.\n\n## Vote Discussion\n\nDAO [Discord](https://discord.gg/R8Ekv6yxK9) in the #vote-discussion channel.\n\n## Proposal\n\nIf the community approves this proposal with a FOR vote a Discord channel will be created where community members are invited to submit their preferred auditors. The DAO will create a shortlist of candidates and initiate contact with them.\n\nPlease vote **FOR** to **approve** this proposal or **AGAINST** to **block** this proposal.\n\n",

      "title": "Buy wBNB and BTCB Tokens",
      "content": "MetFi DAO wants to buy 400,000 BUSD value of wBNB (Wrapped BNB) and 400,000 BUSD value of BTCB (Wrapped Bitcoin). The treasury wallet will hold all of the acquired wBNB and BTCB.\n\nTreasury holds approximately 1.2 million BUSD at the time of writing.\n\n## Motivation\n\nMetFi DAO wants to create new liquidity pools on Pancake Swap using wBNB and BTCB as they are highly liquid tokens. The treasury, as the liquidity provider, will generate additional revenue from exchange rates and trading fees. MFI needs to be more accessible to more people and creating more liquidity pools is one important step in that direction. 100% of the profits go to the treasury.\n\nWhen crypto markets experience a drop such as we are having now many of the best crypto projects delay their initial coin offering (ICO), just like traditional companies delay their initial public offering (IPO). Some launchpads have halted new project listings for an unspecified time, including metaverse and Web3 projects. \n\nIn the current environment now would be a good time for the treasury to diversify by exchanging some of its BUSD for wrapped BTC (BTCB) which is a 1:1 pegged Bitcoin on the BNB Smart Chain. BTC is the granddaddy of the crypto space and this is an opportunity to buy the dip as they say.  \nBitcoin is trading between 20,000 – 23,000 BUSD at the time of writing. BTC and therefore BTCB has significant support at these levels as it was the token’s all-time high in December 2017 and the range has been tested numerous times since. That does not guarantee that BTC cannot break down below $20,000 in the short term however the DAO believes BTC will trade above that level in the medium-long term.\n\n## Background\n\nBNB is the BNB Smart Chain native token and wBNB is a wrapped version of it making it possible to utilize in DeFi (https://www.bnbchain.org/vi/blog/what-is-wbnb/). wBNB is backed 1:1 with BNB and will always be exchangeable 1:1 for BNB. BNB powers the BNB Smart Chain as it is used to pay transaction fees (gas) across the network. It is also used to buy new project tokens on Binance Launchpad and is widely used on decentralized exchanges (DEX) to form liquidity pool trading pairs. \n\nBTCB is a BEP2/BEP20 asset wrapped (pegged) on BNB Smart Chain with a 1:1 peg to BTC locked on the Bitcoin blockchain. BTCB is operated on a centralized and trust-based model. The 1:1 peg means that the amount of wrapped BTCB is equal to the amount of BTC locked in a public address. The issuer of the wrapped BTCB tokens is Binance.\n\n## Vote Discussion\n\nJoin the discussion on this proposal in MetFi DAOs Discord and go the #vote-discussion channel. \n\n## Proposal\n\nIf the community approves this proposal with a FOR vote. MetFi DAO will use treasury BUSD to exchange 400,000 BUSD for BNB and 400,000 BUSD for BNB. \n\nPlease vote FOR to approve this proposal or AGAINST to block this proposal from passing.",

      "title": "Lock 100% of MetFi DAOs Pancake Swap Liquidity for Five (5) Years",
      "content": "MetFi DAO wants to lock 100% of its Pancake Swap liquidity for five (5) years to ensure that a rugpull event cannot occur in the next five (5) years.\n\nTreasury holdings **WILL NOT** be locked if this proposal is approved because treasury holdings fund the investments that the treasury makes on behalf of the MetFi community.\n\nMetFi DAO is owned by all MFI token holders and MetFi NFT holders - the MetFi community is now invited to vote on this proposal.\n\n## Background\nLocking MetFi DAOs Pancake Swap liquidity into a smart contract guarantees that MetFi DAO cannot be ‘rugged’ i.e., the creator of the smart contracts cannot pull the rug out from under the MetFi communities’ feet and run away with the Pancake Swap liquidity pool as that would be detrimental to entire MetFi ecosystem. If MetFi DAOs Pancake Swap liquidity is locked NO-ONE can access the locked tokens that are in the Pancake Swap liquidity pool for five (5years), ensuring that the tokens cannot be moved or spent and liquidity will always be present for anyone to trade MFI tokens.\n\nThere are around 825 MFI and 750,000 BUSD tokens in the Pancake Swap liquidity pool - totaling up to a USD value of $1.6 Million at the time of this post on June 3, 2022. PancakeSwap pools tend to fluctuate with the token price and the relationship between pooled tokens will always vary.\n\n## Motivation\nLocking MetFi DAOs liquidity for five (5) years, this early sends and very strong signal to the MetFi community, and the broader global market, that MetFi has, and is, being systematically built to last, and that MetFi DAO is 100% committed to fulfilling its vision of becoming the world\\'s #1 Metaverse and Web3 incubator and sharing the financial returns with all MetFi NFT holders.\n\nMetFi DAO sees Metaverse and Web3 projects through a corporate and institutional lens. MetFi DAO is regularly invited to participate in the world’s most promising early-stage (seed) investment rounds.\n\nMetFi DAO wants to make strategic early-stage investments into some of these projects – the ideal way to do that is to tick all of the boxes that need to be ticked - this proposal is the first of many proposals, and many boxes that will need to be ticked off by the MetFi community if MetFi DAO is to fulfil its vision on behalf of the MetFi community.\n\n## Proposal\n\nIf the community approves this proposal with a YES vote. MetFi DAO will lock 100% of the liquidity that is in the Pancake Swap pool when the vote has been decided.\n\n1.\tIf the community approves this proposal with a YES vote the DAO will move all PancakeSwap LP tokens held in the treasury to this smart contract and set parameters for a five (5) year lock.\n\n2.\tAfter five (5) years have elapsed the smart contract will automatically send all of the locked tokens to the treasury – the tokens cannot be sent to any other wallet per the smart contract parameters that will be set.\n\n3.\tThe liquidity lock will be easily verifiable on chain.\n\nPlease vote YES to approve this proposal or NO to block this proposal from passing.\n\nPancake Swap Liquidity Pool Contract: https://bscscan.com/token/0xeb5bb9d14d27f75c787cf7475e7ed00d21dc7279?a=0x051e5c7af6690f5eb33893ba91c49faff72ceebf\n\nTime lock smartcontract: https://github.com/metfi/metfi-contracts/blob/main/contracts/other/ERC20TreasuryFundsLock.sol\ndeployed at: https://bscscan.com/address/0xC0E2608bf2CE74D70bBb943E05404192B93fF22E",
