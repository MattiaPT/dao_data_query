      "content": "### Proposal\nIncrease the self-stake of Beethoven X validator by 100’000 FTM.\n\n### Motivation\nWith the passing of [BIP-67](https://discord.com/channels/885764705526882335/1239735304961921054), the DAO approved to start a Beethoven X validator for Fantom and to self-stake 100’000 FTM from DAO’s treasury. As a reminder, a validator earns additional rewards based on delegated FTM and can only receive 15 times the self-stake amount as delegations. This amount has now been filled and thus no more delegations can currently be added to the [Beethoven X validator](https://explorer.fantom.network/validator/0x417940a3050085723788439d4d69365d50c06d99).\n\nWe propose to self-stake another 100’000 FTM from DAO’s treasury, doubling the delegatable amount to a total of 3’000’000 FTM. Everything else set by BIP-67 will still stand in effect, including the plan to migrate the validator to Sonic once the chain is live.\n\n### Specification\nThe BIP will approve additional 100’000 FTM from DAO’s treasury to be added to the self-stake amount of Beethoven X validator (ID 168), which increases the maximum delegatable amount from the current 1’500’000 FTM to 3’000’000 FTM. \n\n### Impacts/Risk Assessment\nThis BIP would approve to increase the self-stake amount to our validator, which has been now running without experiencing issues.\n\n### Specification/Execution Plan\nWe use up to 100’000 FTM from treasury to increase the self-stake of our validator. This may be done in smaller batches.",

      "title": "BIP-71: Recover FTM from Validator 167",
      "content": "### Background\nOn August 1st, the keys to the wallet for validator 167, which is not the Beethoven X validator, got compromised and his wallet was drained. In addition, the attacker also unstaked all the staked FTM from validator 167. Beethoven X has delegated 1M FTM to the affected validator through sFTMx. These funds are not at risk, but are also not earning any rewards at the moment. \nOver the past week, we’ve investigated ways to unlock the 1M FTM that we have delegated. After developing and testing options, we have deployed a contract to Fantom which allows our treasury to unstake the 1M FTM without any impact to sFTMx holders.\n\n### Technical details\nWhen a delegator or staker wants to unlock the FTM pre-maturely, a penalty needs to be paid. In the normal use case when a user is withdrawing FTM, if we need to unlock early, the user who initiates the request will pay this penalty when he burns the sFTMx. In this scenario we don't have a user that pays it and if we just unlock, it would result in a drop in the rate of sFTMx per FTM. We want to avoid this scenario under all circumstances. We’ve developed a contract that will unlock the vault and in the same transaction refund the sFTMx staking contract with the same amount of FTM so that no decrease in the rate will occur. \n\nThe contract source code can be found here: https://github.com/beethovenxfi/sftmx/blob/main/contracts/VaultUnlocker.sol\nThe tests here: https://github.com/beethovenxfi/sftmx/blob/main/scripts/VaultUnlocker.ts\nThe tenderly simulation here: https://dashboard.tenderly.co/shared/simulation/d493f3fa-776a-433c-86b4-f39b6b2f5082\n\nThe penalty that is due for the withdrawal is increasing over time at roughly 170 FTM per day. In light of this, we would like to move this proposal forward as fast as possible.\n\nMotivation\nTo make sure that sFTMx holders earn yield on all the staked FTM, we’ll need to withdraw and re-stake to a different validator. \n\n### Specification\nThe treasury will use this unlocker contract https://ftmscan.com/address/0xd0f62fbe32a72cd18ab8943b52220a7af6c743f4 to retrieve the funds. The course of action will be:\n- Transfer 6k FTM to the unlocker contract to fund the recovery of the penalty\n- Transfer ownership of the three affected staking vaults to above contract\n- Call unlockVault for each of the three affected staking vaults\n- Call harvestVault on the staking contract to initialize the 7 day withdrawal\n- Retrieve left-over FTM from the unlocker contract\n\nAfter 7 days, we will withdraw the FTM from these vaults into the free pool.\n\nWe are in close contact with validator 167 and he has confirmed that he will reimburse the treasury for any penalty that it needed to pay in order to unlock the funds.\n\n### Risk/Impact\nThe current cost for the penalty of delegating sits at 3.3k FTM. While the validator has given their word that they'll reimburse any associated costs, then there is a chance that the treasury would need to cover the amount otherwise.",

      "content": "# Background\n\nThe Fantom Foundation launched a grant program https://blog.fantom.foundation/sonic-labs-innovator-fund/ to support dApps that deploy on Sonic. We were offered such a grant as a DAO and will hereby seek approval from the DAO to receive this grant. \n\nUnfortunately we are not allowed to disclose the amount of the grant but we can disclose the main points of the agreement:\n\n*Vesting Terms:*\n- Initial 25% will be paid upfront (within 14 days of the Effective Date);\n- 25% will be paid within 14 days of the deployment of the application on the Sonic Network;\n- The remaining 50% of the grant allocation will be paid monthly, with ⅙ of the amount paid until its completion from the dApps deployment on Sonic.\n\n*Launch on Sonic:*\nThe Beethoven X DAO agrees to integrate its Protocol on Sonic within 45 days' written notice from the Sonic Labs team regarding the deployment of the mainnet Sonic Network.\nIn the event of any delay in the network launch, the terms and conditions of this Agreement shall remain unchanged and fully enforceable. \n\n*Use of Funds:*\nAll grant funding provided by Sonic must be used exclusively for the development and maintenance of the application on the Sonic Network. If any portion of the funding is used to support alternative networks outside of the Sonic Network, the Beethoven X DAO is required to return the entire amount of the funding provided by Sonic under this agreement from the Effective Date. \nIn essence, if accepting this grant, the Beethoven X DAO commits to deploy on Sonic chain once it launches and use the grant only to support development and maintenance of the dApp on Sonic. \n\nThe spending of the grant will be under the discretion of the Music Directors. The grant will be sent to a dedicated Multisig to ensure it’s used only for the intended purpose as described above and agreed to in the contract.\n\n# Impact/Risks\nWe commit ourselves to deploy on Sonic chain.\n\n# Specification\nUpon acceptance of this grant, a Beethoven X Dao representative will sign the contract with the Fantom Foundation. The grant will be paid to Beethoven X Dao and held in the dedicated multisig. It will be used to support and operate the dApp on Sonic (i.e. paying for Composer salaries, infrastructure cost, etc).",

      "title": "BIP-67: Fund a Fantom Validator by Beethoven X",
      "content": "### Background\nWhen Beethoven X DAO assumed control of sFTMx, it was on our roadmap to run our own validator. Running our own validator has the advantage that we can delegate a portion of the deposited FTM from sFTMx to this validator and earn additional revenue. It was the plan to wait for the Sonic upgrade to be available for Fantom Opera before we would take on this project.\n\nNow that the upgrade to Sonic is imminent, we propose that the treasury funds such a validator. Note, even if we run our own validator, we still want to keep spreading the underlying FTM from sFTMx to multiple validators to keep the network decentralized.\n\nTo run a validator and participate in securing the network, the validator needs to stake a minimum amount of 50k FTM (so-called self-stake) and lock it for a year. It can then receive 15 times the self-stake amount as delegations and earn additional rewards on delegated FTM.\n\nA validator earns ~6% APR (currently 6.33%) on the self-staked FTM and in addition receives 15% of the rewards of delegated FTM. \n\nIn total, a validator with 50k self-stake and maximum delegations (50000x15=750k) earns 3165 FTM (50000x0.0633) plus 7121.25 FTM (750000x0.0633x0.15) = 10286.25 FTM per year (7200 USD at 0.70c)\n\nThe reward scales linearly with more FTM staked and delegated. Because more staked and delegated FTM does not need more compute or storage resources, net profit increases with more FTM staked or delegated.\n\nThe system requirements are not yet released, but if you follow the announcements and news, requirements for compute and storage are drastically decreased with the Sonic upgrade. For the Opera version of Fantom, a validator costs around 6k USD per year on AWS. We believe that the operational cost for a Sonic node is far below that.\n\nGiven the FTM we have in our treasury as well as our current delegation distribution of sFTMx, we propose to self-stake 100k FTM to our validator which will in turn allow us to delegate a total of 1.5M FTM from sFTMx. Once the validator is fully delegated, estimated revenue is 20572.5 FTM per year.\n\nWe can decide at a later point to self-stake more FTM and delegate more FTM from sFTMx to our validator with another BIP.\n\nThe validator will also be able to use the delegated FTM as voting power in Fantom governance. We propose to replicate the Fantom governance votes in Snapshot for maBeets holders to determine voting power allocation, effectively allocating the staked FTM voting power to maBeets holders.\n\n## Impacts/Risk\nSince we expect a new chain to be launched in fall, the validators for Fantom Opera will become obsolete over time. We do not know how a possible migration of staked and locked FTM will look like or whether it is even possible.\n\nThe self-staked FTM is locked for a year but could be withdrawn early by paying back a portion of the already earned rewards.\n\n## Specification/Execution Plan\nOnce the Sonic upgrade is live, we will spin up a validator node. We use 100k FTM from treasury to self-stake and gradually delegate FTM from sFTMx to the validator until maximum delegation is reached.\nOperational cost of the validator will be covered by the infra BIP.\n\nApproval of this BIP will also allow us to decommission the validator on Opera and spin up and fund a new one on the new chain once it is live.\n\n*Please see the below Discord link for discussion",

      "title": "BIP-66: Migrate DAO lzUSDC holdings to USDC.e",
      "content": "### Proposal: \nMigrate DAO Treasury’s lzUSDC/wFTM & sFTMx/lzUSDC Beethoven Pool Tokens to sFTMx/USDC.e 70/30 BPTs.\n### Motivation: \nThe Fantom Foundation has announced support for Wormhole bridged USDC.e, with plans for it to act as the canonical stablecoin on the Fantom network. Layer Zero is also winding down support for their bridged USDC. These developments will likely see USDC.e become both the most dominant and most supported USDC version on Fantom.\n\nBeethoven X DAO holds ~$240k of lzUSDC/wFTM ‘Fantom Layer of the Opera’ BPT, and ~$210k of lzUSDC/sFTMx ‘Layered & Staked Fantom Opera’ BPT. Migrating these holdings to BPTs with USDC.e will support the Fantom Foundation’s vision while moving to a version with greater long term support prospects.\n\nTreasury’s USDC.e/lzUSDC/axlUSDC ‘Trio of the Stables’ position will be maintained, in order to aid Fantom network’s migration to USDC.e while generating volume and fees for the DEX.\n### Impacts/Risk Assessment:\n - This migration would entail a shift of risk exposure from Layer Zero’s lzUSDC to Wormhole bridged USDC.e\n - DAO Treasury holdings are a significant portion of our DEX lzUSDC TVL. Therefore the migration will greatly reduce our direct volume and fees from lzUSDC pools, while increasing volume and fees from USDC.e pools\n - Alignment with Fantom Foundation’s vision will help Beethoven X to maintain positioning within the Fantom ecosystem\n### Impact on Beethoven X Treasury:\nFollowing the passing of BIPs 64 & 65 which increased the monthly amounts for contributors and infrastructure, Treasury requires an additional ~$16k of stablecoin holdings to fulfil the minimum specifications of BIP 57. This amount will be sourced from the dissolution of FLotO and conversion of it’s lzUSDC to USDC.e, leaving ~$104k of extra stablecoins from that BPT. The ~$120k of wFTM in FLotO will be converted to sFTMx and paired with ~$51k of USDC.e, leaving ~$54k of additional stablecoins above the minimum requirement of Tenets 1 & 2 of BIP 57.\n\nThese movements would result in a net increase of assets assigned as risk level 0, while reducing the amount at risk level 1. \n\nAll of the above figures are liable to change between writing and execution of the proposal, due to FTM price changes and consequent shift in the values within the BPTs being dissolved.\n### Specification/Execution Plan:\nFollowing approval of this proposal, Music Directors will break Treasury’s ‘Fantom Layer of the Opera’ & ‘Layered & Staked Fantom Opera’ BPTs. The lzUSDC will be converted to USDC.e which, alongside the sFTMx and wFTM, will be used to form USDC.e/sFTMx BPTs. A portion of the USDC.e will be redirected as stablecoin reserves, to help ensure continued adherence to the Treasury framework as outlined in BIP-57.\n\nFurther questions or discussions are welcome at: https://discord.com/channels/885764705526882335/1236447623829913622/1236447775114395658",

      "title": "BIP-65 Infrastructure Funding Extension and Cap Adjustment for April 2024 - September 2024",
      "content": "Intro:\n\nFor three 6-month cycles the Beethoven X DAO treasury has maintained a capped infrastructure cost funding (BIP-23, BIP-36 and BIP-41) for the protocol. Through this the treasury covers the infrastructure costs associated with the operation of beets.fi. This proposal seeks to continue this funding arrangement. The funding for infrastructure will be capped at $4500 USDC per month, a slight increase, allowing us to be better prepared if the market conditions continue reflecting the positive developments in bringing down infrastructure costs over the duration of the funding arrangement. In addition, we will need to migrate our subgraphs to the graphs decentralized network which is no longer free to use and Stellate prices will increase.\n\nMotivation:\n\nInfrastructure is critical for the availability of the beets.fi services and costs are directly related to the amount of trading, traffic and requests needed to be served.\n\nThe market being slow through the summer of 2023 and into Q4, is visible on the graph below and reflects less requests needing to be served. The momentum shift into 2024 and increased activity on Fantom and Optimism is also reflected. While we remain well below the infrastructure cap we propose to lift the cap to $4.5k which will cover higher load on our infrastructure plus additional cost incurred by The Graph’s decentralized network which will no longer be free. In addition, our caching provider Stellate will also raise their prices by 50% starting from May. It is hard for us to estimate how much additional cost this will incur, but we’ll try our best to keep it as low as possible.\n\nIn 2023 the joint development of the backend infrastructure together with Balancer commenced and with the integration of the Balancer chains into the backend infrastructure, it was decided that the infrastructure will be hosted in Balancer's AWS account. Therefore, the cost of this needed not be carried by Beethoven X DAO allowing us to decrease the cap from $7.5k monthly to $2.5k. Below you can see that the migration of the infrastructure in June and July resulted in a significant drop in expenses.\n\nSince the infrastructure is now running under Balancer’s AWS account, it is likely that Beethoven X DAO will be asked to pay a share of the cost, proportional to our usage. This proposal will be resubmitted / amended as and when this occurs. Regardless, the infrastructure consolidation helps reduce cost overall and should remain below the pre-consolidation levels, relative to the activity, for Beethoven. \n\nRisks:\n\nPotential risks of cost inflation due to unpredictable factors like surges in user traffic continue to exist. In case of such overspends, separate proposals will be presented for community approval.\n\nImpacts and Specification:\n\nTreasury will shoulder the new monthly infrastructure cost cap of $4500.\n\nImpact on Previous BIPs: This BIP serves as an extension and modification of the most recent BIP that concludes in March 2024.\n\nTeam: No impact.\n\nTokenomics: None\n\nOther Committees Recognized by the DAO: None.\n\nExecution Plan:\n\nThe DAO treasury will cover the infrastructure costs up to a maximum of $4500 per month for the next six months, starting in April 2024 and ending in September 2024. This represents a potential maximum expenditure of $27,000 for this period.",

      "title": "BIP-64 Treasury Funding for Beethoven X DAO Contributors",
      "content": "Introduction and Motivation:\n\nThe Beethoven DAO Treasury plays a vital role in retaining and attracting key contributors to work on and advancing Beethoven X. Through defined six-month funding cycles, facilitated by BIPs-35, -40, and -55 since October 2022, the DAO has extended support to contributors. Now, we propose to sustain this funding model, with a slight increase of $5k per month, for a total of $40k per month, from the Treasury. This extension will cover a further 6 months from April 2024 to the end of September 2024. \n\nBackground:\n\nEver since the earliest bootstrapping phases of Beethoven X, the Beethoven DAO and its contributors have been able to finance operations from the activity of the protocol. Today the DAO is instrumental in maintaining a high functioning and operational team that is active in the best interest of the protocol. \n\nThe market downturn in 2022-2023 has forced Beethoven DAO contributors to be adaptable and flexible. At times contributor count was slashed by more than 30% and contributor rates cut by 50%. Nevertheless, the contributors have endured thanks to the foresight and engagement of the Beethoven DAO. Additionally, the close and strategic relationship with the Balancer DAO and the resulting service provider agreements, have provided an additional revenue stream for the DAO, used to fund contributors. Currently, this arrangement helps offset DAO Contributor costs by up to $59k per month. These combined funding sources are essential for attracting and retaining contributors, ensuring the continued operation of the protocol. \n\nThese proposals have facilitated our continued focus on development and allowed Beethoven X DAO Contributors to maintain the headcount of approx. 9.5 FTE (full time equivalents) over the past 6 months. These resources are divided as follows: \n(1 FTE = 100%)\nMarketing, Sales and Community: 365%\nDesign: 60%\nPartnerships & Biz Dev: 70%\nDevelopment: 335%\nGovernance, Reporting & Data: 100%\nAdmin: 25%\nTotal: 955%\n\nBeethoven X's commitment to state-of-the-art technology and a decentralized, transparent, and censorship-resistant community remains unwavering. The additional funding from the Treasury, combined with the contributions from the Balancer DAO, has allowed our DAO contributors to stay dedicated to this vision. Noteworthy achievements in the past 6 months include:\n\n1. Restructuring of the Treasury and Risk Management Framework\n2. Migrating Bribes to Hidden Hand and Diversifying the Gauge Bounties\n3. Taking over sFTMx and becoming the top LST hub on Fantom\n4. Actively liaising with the Fantom Foundation and ensuring that Beethoven X is well positioned to capitalise on the exciting new developments\n5. Actively Contributing to the technical vision and further development of Balancer core technologies\n6. Actively shaping and participating in the development of Balancer v3\n7. Actively reaching out to projects to increase the number of partners on our Fantom and Optimism deployments and maintaining the current ones\n \nThe market conditions, after a strong Q4 in 2023, have remained bullish in Q1 of 2024. Market participants' confidence and optimism have increased substantially, in the post Bitcoin SPOT ETF era and run up to the BTC Halving. Beethoven X has seen corresponding improvements in key metrics across the board. During the previous funding period, we have observed increases in fees on the Fantom network. Additionally, Fantom has experienced a bullish surge thanks to planned changes which should help the ecosystem recover from the multichain incident and bear market. Through the takeover of sFTMx by the Beethoven X DAO we have been able to acquire an additional source of revenue. On the Optimism network, TVL has increased steadily and Beethoven has become a sizable hub for LST liquidity. We hope this positive sentiment will continue in 2024 and believe that relevance, volume, and activity of the protocol will steadily increase again. \n\nAs of April 3rd, the Beethoven X Treasury holds assets worth $4’857’966, with $3’469’033 in active assets (that can be deemed liquid or the treasury has full control over). Treasury assets can be viewed here:\nFantom: https://debank.com/profile/0xa1e849b1d6c2fd31c63eef7822e9e0632411ada7\nOptimism: https://debank.com/profile/0x2a185c8a3c63d7bfe63ad5d950244ffe9d0a4b60\nEthereum: https://debank.com/profile/0xea06e1b4259730724885a39ce3ca670efb020e26\n\nTreasury Proposal:\n\nThis proposal, if adopted, will extend treasury funding at $40k per month for the next six months, covering the period from April 2024 to the end of September 2024. This extension will provide us with the necessary resources to maintain and enhance the Beethoven X protocol while striving to be the leading DEX on Fantom and Optimism. The proposed increase of $5,000 per month will be allocated towards bolstering resources in pivotal areas, such as business development and marketing. \n\nAdditionally, we expect continued augmentation of the $40k by the Balancer service provider agreements, which help offset DAO Contributor costs by up to $59k per month. This proposal also foresees the continued use of any funds arising from service provider agreements (currently $59k per month) to be continued to be used for funding contributors.\n\nWe appreciate your consideration and support in ensuring the continued growth and development of Beethoven X.\n\nThank you for your time and attention. \n\nImpact for the 6 months:\n\nContributors – Step 1: DAO Contributors will receive an aggregate fixed $40k per month ($240k in total) Budget in USDC from the Treasury. In addition, Step 2, as long as the Balancer service provider agreement remains unchanged : $59k in Revenue from the service provider agreement with Balancer is paid into Treasury monthly and will be used to fund the core contributor wallet.\n\nTreasury – Treasury assumes a fixed monthly cost of $40k per month ($240k in total) in USDC and commits to passing the $59k (or any new equivalent arising from SP contracts) in USDC received service provider agreement onwards, to be used for the payment of DAO Contributors.\n\nTokenomics – No impact\n\nCommittees – No impact\n\nSpecification:\n\nEach month, $40k USDC from Treasury and, upon request, any USDC received by Treasury for service provider agreements with Balancer DAO will be sent to the wallet: 0x0EDfcc1b8D082Cd46d13Db694b849D7d8151C6D5 (or another wallet designated for the payment of contributors). No additional work or modification to status quo operations is required.\n\nExecution Plan:\n\nUpon approval, the Treasury will send $40k in USDC to the team wallet for each month spanning this proposal. Treasury will periodically transfer funds from the anticipated Balancer DAO service provider agreements to the same wallet. These authorizations will take effect immediately when the period outlined in this BIP commences. Therefore, the 1st payment will be in May 2024 to cover April 2024. This will continue with the last payment (6th payment) being the payment for the month of September 2024 in the beginning of October 2024.",

      "title": "BIP 63 - sFTMx protocol revenue distribution",
      "content": "We have considered all feedback provided for the previous sFTMx liquid staking revenue proposal and have created a plan to address the immediate concerns and provide for long-term sustainable growth with particular outlook to the launch of Sonic.\n\nAs the saying goes, you must spend money to make money. Wise and calculated investments can yield exponential returns. We have already seen the sFTMx supply grow remarkably since BeethovenX has taken over the protocol. The continuation of this trend should lead to greater sFTMx revenue and consequently, greater maBEETS bounties.\n\nThis new plan further encourages Fantom ecosystem cooperation and collaboration through the development of an sFTMx ecosystem growth program. This will vastly increase the DAO’s networking potential and its ability to harness more business development opportunities. By expanding sFTMx liquidity and supply, more revenue will be driven to sFTMx and maBEETS bounties to spin the sFTMx and maBEETS flywheel.\n\nSummary:\n\nDevelop a collaborative ecosystem growth program to expand the reach, visibility, marketing, adoption, use, and supply of sFTMx. Set treasury allocation to 10% for $BEETS buybacks and temporarily allocate 80% to maBEETS bounties until the launch of the growth program.\n\nMotivations:\n\n- Grow sFTMx liquidity, visibility, marketing, supply, use, adoption, and liquid staking revenue.\n- Increase maBEETS bounties.\n- Increase BeethovenX revenue and fees.\n- Drive Fantom ecosystem cooperation and collaboration.\n- Increase BeethovenX networking and business development power.\n- Provide partners a means to participate in the ecosystem expansion program.\n- Increase maBEETS bounties until the program is launched.\n- Increase maBEETS bounties exponentially in the long term.\n- Enhance the sustainability and longevity of the protocol through $BEETS buy-backs.\n- Capitalize on the launch of Sonic.\n\nProposal:\n\nWe propose to launch an sFTMx growth program that aims to grow its reach, visibility, marketing, adoption, use, supply and ultimately revenue of sFTMx. Currently, sFTMx does not make much revenue as a whole. We believe that investing in this growth can create a flywheel to increase the sFTMx supply and revenue exponentialy into the foreseeable future. \n\nWe propose to utilize 50% of the sFTMx revenue for this purpose as the foundational element to achieve this goal and to create an efficient and sensible framework that allows growing sFTMx liquidity, supply and revenue. The current thinking is that any project can become part of the growth program and can receive a share of the 50% revenue allocation, proportional to their utilization of sFTMx. It is important to note that Beethoven X can also become part of this program and receive a share of this allocation. In step with this plan, we look forward to the launch of Sonic and the many new opportunities the program and Sonic will open for sFTMx, maBEETS, and BeethovenX as a whole.\n\nThis proposal continues to allocate 10% of sFTMx revenue to Stader and earmarks it for the DAO treasury once the payment obligations with Stader ends. 10% will also be used to further the longevity of the protocol by acquiring more $BEETS via treasury buy-backs.\n\nUntil the growth program launches, 80% of sFTMx revenue will be distributed to Beethoven's sFTMx gauges as increased maBEETS bounties.The MDs will decide which pools to incentivize, prioritizing the growth of sFTMx and shall decide if the bounties will be distributed as minted or bought sFTMx or as sFTMx BPTs. Upon launch of the sFTMx growth program, this allocation will be reduced to 30% with the goal to increase the total sFTMx revenue long-term and therefore also increase maBEETS bounties.\n\nImpacts/Risk assessment:\n\nA short-term increase in maBEETs bounties with the goal of an even greater increase long term after the implementation of the ecosystem program. Increased BeethovenX liquidity for sFTMx in the short term. Long term, the sFTMx total supply and liquidity across all pools should substantially increase along with sFTMx revenue. More Partnerships and collaborations across the network, further strengthening the reach and power of BeethovenX business development. The buy-backs will further stock the treasury with $BEETS, increasing the protocol’s sustainability, and providing a means for replenishing any $BEETS used as part of the sFTMx expansion program as seen with BIP-62.\n\nThe risks include smart contracts and the possibility of malicious attacks.\n\nExecution:\n\nThe sFTMx fee allocations will take place as soon as possible following the adoption of this BIP. The Composers and MDs will continue to develop the details of the ecosystem program, partner outreach and the creation of educational materials. An article will be prepared and published at a later date that describes the inner workings of the program. Its commencement date will be announced when ready to launch and continued partner outreach and collaboration will follow to further growth the program. The MDs and Composers will execute the buy-backs at their discretion and remain sensitive to market timing.",

      "title": "BIP 62: Creation and operation of Equalizer gauge and incentives.",
      "content": "Summary: \n\nUse a portion of DAO Treasury FTM and BEETS to create an LP position on Equalizer DEX and bootstrap the liquidity incentives.\n\n--------------------\n\nMotivations:\n\nVisibility and marketing for sFTMx.\nPartnership and Fantom ecosystem cooperation.\nDeepening liquidity for BEETS and sFTMx.\nPossibility to grow DAO treasury although this is ancillary.\n\nBeethovenX has taken over the management of sFTMx and in the short time since then, we have seen rather impressive adoption and growth of the sFTMx Liquid Staking Token (LST). As the owners and managers of the LST protocol, the BeethovenX DAO will constantly strive to drive awareness, use, and adoption of the sFTMx token. This is not only for the sake of business, but also to support and bolster the network by growing on-chain TVL and helping to secure the network with more FTM tokens staked onto more validators. Through the hard work and dedication of the Equalizer team, their protocol has become widely used by their own following of a unique user base. We aim to tap into that unique user base and gain further visibility for the sFTMx token. We also are constantly in the pursuit of garnering cooperation and strength in unity on the FTM network. With this proposal the DAO will take yet another step closer in accomplishing all of these goals.\n\n--------------------\n\nProposal:\n\nThis proposal would grant Music Directors the ability to move treasury assets to Equalizer and create a BEETS/sFTMx classic xy=k traditional liquidity pool and gauge. It would also enable them to use treasury assets to bootstrap the first epoch’s incentives.\n\nWith this proposal the MDs will be granted an allowance ceiling cap of moving up to $100,000 USD value of treasury BEETS and FTM or sFTMx per month, never exceeding $500,000 in aggregate. The purpose of this stated ceiling is to not take away from the already allotted treasury management amounts granted in the original framework meaning these ceilings for this specific purpose are in addition to the general management amounts already allotted to the MDs. These ceilings are simply limits and do not in any way mean this much monthly discretionary value will be utilized. The MDs will use their discretion in determining the most prudent and efficient use of these treasury assets for this purpose.\n\nThe proposal also includes a first action of acquiring the sFTMx. This will be done by either minting or market buying, or a combination of the two, whichever is the most efficient. MDs will decide incentive values with the aim of maintaining an emissions APR that is deemed suitable, while also aiming for the POL to be self-sustainable by using farmed tokens as voting incentives. Excess farmed equal will be stored until a monthly evaluation takes place. At this point the MDs will decide whether to use this excess to bootstrap incentives for a larger TVL injection, compound into the position, lock the tokens to begin “incentive recycling”, or any other purpose they see fit.\n\nThe initial deposit amount would not count towards the existing $200,000 monthly discretionary treasury asset reallocation limit, nor would use of the EQUAL emissions for voting incentives count towards the $10,000 monthly incentives limit nor the $20,000 monthly non-protocol fee revenue generation limit. Swapping, compounding, locking or any other action taken with the farmed equal tokens will be similarly excluded. Similarly, any withdrawals of the POL will not be counted against the above cited framework limits. Any further deposits to Equalizer which are outside of this scope would be subject to the monthly limit unless otherwise approved by governance.\n\n--------------------\n\nImpacts/Risk Assessment:\n\nA BEETS/sFTMx pool on Equalizer would provide an additional avenue for DeFi participants to encounter and engage with both tokens. \n\nThe resulting BEETS/sFTMx protocol owned liquidity, and any additional liquidity that enters the pool would deepen liquidity for both tokens. The net effect of this would depend on the value relative to other pools with these tokens. For sFTMx, the pool would likely have minimal impact compared to existing sFTMx pools on Fantom. For BEETS, the pool would likely have greater relative impact although this would still be small compared to existing BEETS pools on Fantom. \n\nBy providing liquidity, DAO assets would be exposed to risk of impermanent loss which could be irreversible. Although the POL would receive EQUAL emissions, it is possible that the value of these does not offset the value lost.\n\nMoving Treasury assets as proposed introduces an added layer of smart contract risk specific to Equalizer protocol.\n\nIn accordance with BIP-57, being a new partner, this proposal falls under risk level 3 and in line with tenet 5 to the extent that greater awareness, exposure, and marketing of sFTMx will benefit the DAO as a whole. Any direct realized gains are viewed as ancillary and are not the sole purpose and intent of this proposal.\n\n--------------------\n\nSpecification/Execution Plan:\n\nIf this proposal passes, MDs would have the ability to deposit DAO Treasury funds within ‘Classic Constant Product AMM’ and ‘Classic Stableswap’ pools on Equalizer DEx. \n\nFTM would be converted to sFTMx which would then be paired with the equivalent value of BEETS to deposit on Equalizer. \n\nMDs would have discretion to place gauge vote incentives for the pool, and the emissions earnt by the DAO’s position would be used for voting incentives, asset accumulation, position compounding, or locking and recycling at the discretion of MDs.",

      "title": "BIP-61: Beethoven X DAO Assumes Control of sFTMx",
      "content": "### Beethoven X DAO Assumes Control of sFTMx\n\n## Background:\nsFTMx, an interest-bearing liquid wrapper for staked FTM developed by Stader, was launched in April 2022 and stands as the largest liquid wrapper for staked FTM, with approximately 7 million minted sFTMx. \n\nBeethoven X has played an active role since the launch, acting as the main liquidity hub and closely collaborating with Stader Labs to ensure adequate liquidity and peg stability of sFTMx. Despite market volatility, sFTMx has remained robust and has proven itself as a quality asset in the Fantom ecosystem.  Furthermore, the sFTMx contract has been audited by Peckshield, which can be seen here: https://staderlabs-docs.s3.amazonaws.com/audits/fantom/PeckShield-Audit-Report-StaderFTMStaking-v1.0.pdf\n\n## Transition Proposal:\nAfter a governance vote in November 2023, Stader Labs opted to wind down its operations involving sFTMx. Acknowledging the pivotal role sFTMx plays in the Fantom DeFi ecosystem, contributors from Beethoven X initiated discussions with Stader. These discussions culminated in an agreement, facilitating the transfer of sFTMx management to Beethoven X.\n\nThe Beethoven X DAO serves as the primary liquidity hub for sFTMx via the beets.fi platform and, as such, is strategically positioned to enrich and expand the sFTMx offering. This proposal seeks approval from the Beethoven X DAO for the seamless transition of sFTMx from Stader Labs. \n\n## Proposal Specifics:\n**Ownership Transfer:** Transfer ownership of the proxy contract to the Beethoven X DAO multisig wallet at 0xa1E849B1d6c2Fd31c63EEf7822e9E0632411ada7.\n\n**UI Integration:** Implement a prominent forwarding link from Stader's sFTMx UI to the Beethoven X UI, notifying users of this agreement. The forwarding link will be placed at the following URL: https://beets.fi/sftmx\n\n**Immediate Payment:** Stader Labs will receive an immediate upfront payment of $25,000 USD or its stablecoin equivalent\n\n**Revenue Share:** Stader Labs is entitled to a 10% revenue share over 48 months for revenue generated through the staking rewards fee applied by the sFTMx contract. Payments will be made monthly, starting Februrary 1, 2024, and concluding on January 31, 2028.\n\n**Announcement:** Collaborate with Beethoven X Contributors to prepare and release shared communications announcing the partnership and agreement once the governance process concludes.",

Read more\"\n\n\"Read more\" links to the official Beethoven X Twitter which gives a message to check the Discord for a list of affected LPs.\n\nThe tweet displayed an outdated Discord link which in the meantime has been compromised.\n\n## Background\n0xc74...ed2 discovered the compromised link when trying to view the the affected pools on the Beethoven discord. The server asked for verification but was really a transaction to transfer FTM as well as other tokens. Due to a sense of urgency to remove liquidity and the belief that the links were to and from a valid server, 0xc74...ed2 completed what was thought to be a verification signature.\n\nTX: https://ftmscan.com/tx/0x37a2055311ba66bf53764e8c29b4a8f9eaf8564d2a0d0cc7bd2c87701f8fecc9\n\n0xc74...ed2 found the official Discord server and reported the compromised link to franzns.\n\nTweets containing the outdated link have been removed as a precaution.\n\n## Proposal\nThis proposal, if adopted, will award 0xc74...ed2 a bug bounty for discovering and reporting the compromised link thereby preventing additional losses from future victims.\n\nBounty rationale\nWide impact potential on users\nProminent display on highly trafficked homepage\nUrgent message increases time pressure for users to act quickly to prevent loss of funds\nVanity link from official Twitter account appears authoritative\n0xc74...ed2 later helped identify other channels with the compromised link aiding in swift corrective action\n\n## Execution Plan\nIf approved, the Treasury will send the approved amount to an address of the bug reporter.",

      "title": "BIP-59 : Reimbursement for Boosted Pools Exploit on Optimism",
      "content": "### Introduction:\nStarting on the morning of 27 Aug 2023 Beethoven X experienced multiple attacks on both the Fantom and Optimism deployments, with a total loss of around $1.1M on Fantom and $320k on Optimism. There are always risks in DeFi, which can be mitigated by audits and due diligence, but never completely avoided. Multiple protocols have experienced exploits and there’s no one way to proceed if such an incident occurs. Balancer released a full technical postmortem report here: https://medium.com/balancer-protocol/rate-manipulation-in-balancer-boosted-pools-technical-postmortem-53db4b642492 and Beethoven’s perspective and time-line can be seen here: https://medium.com/beethoven-x/rate-manipulation-in-balancer-boosted-pools-a-beethoven-x-perspective-e419bbb66592.\n\n**The subject of this proposal is the Optimism deployment, Beethoven X DAO decided not to reimburse on Fantom as part of BIP-53.**\n\n----------------\n### Motivation:\nThe Optimism deployment is set up as a partnership between Beethoven X and Balancer. Following the passing of BIP-445 on Balancer (https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-445-decide-on-direction-of-restitution-for-affected-lps-in-boosted-pool-incident/5187), a 90 day information collection period was held, where affected users could apply for reimbursement. During the 90 day period multiple reminders were sent out over various channels. The collected information is presented in the following google sheet: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1oAAqh2fJnR4EwnHYiKzuJoWZfy1GxmOPTkDj2SAR71I/edit#gid=493935617, based on which the total reimbursement for the loss on Optimism would be $5861.27. \n\nThis proposal is to decide if and how to proceed with the reimbursement based on the information gathered. There has been mutual signaling with Balancer that if a reimbursement happens on Optimism, then both sides of the partnership would cover equal amounts of the value (similarly to how revenue is divided). If Beethoven X DAO decides against reimbursement, then Balancer has indicated they would cover the entire amount. Balancer has decided to reimburse in BAL tokens and has yet to decide whether they are planning to reimburse 75% or 100% of the value lost: https://forum.balancer.fi/t/rfc-linear-pool-hack-restitution/5504.\n\nThe Beethoven X contributors and Music Directors propose holding a Single choice vote with the following options:\n**YES - Beethoven X DAO covers the reimbursement equally with Balancer\nNO - Beethoven X DAO is not willing to cover the reimbursement**\n\n------------------\n### Impacts/Risk Assessment\nThe impact of the proposal depends on which option is chosen. Voting YES means Beethoven X will cover the reimbursement equally with Balancer. Since Balancer has not yet decided whether to reimburse 75% or 100% of the value lost, then Beethoven X would be covering approximately $2931 or $2198. We propose to cover the loss in USDC, since affected users were in stable pools and it will make reimbursement management straightforward. \n\nVoting NO means Beethoven X DAO is not willing to reimburse on Optimism. While Balancer would then cover the loss completely from their side, this could potentially cause disagreements between the partners in the future. \n\nFor other purposes it is difficult to assess potential impacts/risks with such a decision, since the view would be subjective to every user. In any case the decision should be considered as a separate event and not be the basis for any other potential reimbursement discussions.\n\n-----------\n### Specification/Execution Plan\nBeethoven X contributors have agreed to assist with the distribution of the reimbursement on Optimism, during which reimbursement would be airdropped to the wallets that applied for reimbursement. \n\nWith the passing of the BIP the following actions will be taken:\n\n1. Balancer will send the amount they will cover to Beethoven X Ethereum treasury in BAL\n2. Beethoven X will bridge BAL to Optimism\n3. Beethoven X will airdrop BAL (from Balancer) and USDC (from Beethoven X) to the affected wallets. Since BAL is subject to price volatility, then all of the BAL bridged to Optimism will be airdropped to the wallets proportionally to the value lost. \n\nThe reimbursement will take place within a week after BAL has been received by Beethoven X.",

      "title": "BIP-58: Moving Domains To Domainsure",
      "content": "# Motivation\nIn the past, DNS hijacks have been seen all over the DeFi landscape with two of the most recent victims being Velodrome (https://twitter.com/VelodromeFi/status/1731454836703473723) and Balancer (https://twitter.com/Balancer/status/1704281611326357567). This has urged us to revisit our strategy in terms of DNS security. \n\nBalancer has moved their DNS services to a different provider called domainSure. The offered services focus on infrastructure protection and provide a complete suite of tools and mechanisms to secure the DNS. More info on their services can be found here: https://domainsure.com/services/.\n\nI’ve had an initial contact with a representative of the provider and I am convinced that their services greatly increase our DNS security posture. The main advantage is the ability to implement specific processes for account resets or even config changes. Lax processes around account resets is what caused the DNS hijacks for both Balancer and Velodrome. \n\nI propose to onboard as an enterprise client as we will benefit from an account manager which develops a more intimate understanding of our organization, and is a single point of contact that other departments like premium support can escalate to in terms of issues or unknown requests. I believe that the enhanced concierge offering, increased security features, and more robust monitoring of the Enterprise service is worth the additional cost\n\n# Specification\nI am proposing to move our current domains beets.fi, beethovenx.io and beets-ftm-node.com to be managed by domainSure.\n\nWith the move of the above mentioned domain names to domainSure, we will also change the ownership of the domains to the Beethoven X DAO LLC.\n\nThe DNS environment on domainSure will be set up and managed by the core contributors as per best practices defined by domainSure. \n\nThe Beethoven X DAO will subscribe to the enterprise plan for beets.fi which offers the best security options and most importantly a dedicated account representative. Beets-ftm-node.com will be added under a pro plan and beethovenx.io under a defensive plan.\nThe current offer from domainSure totals to a yearly cost of $1169.99 which can be paid in crypto.\n\nPlease find the detailed offer from easyDNS below.\n\nThe contract will be signed by a core contributor as an official representative of the Beethoven X DAO LLC after passing of this BIP.\n\nhttps://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1041614770224254987/1186283528372113558/Beets.FI_Domainsure_Registration_Protection_Agreement_v1.2.pdf?ex=6592afa1&is=65803aa1&hm=8f8eaf786c4f7fb682facd55be90378f6c4d324e3c26120b4b79941f5307c494&****",

The following BIP is composed of 2 intermingled sections: Tenets and Risk.\n\n# Motivation:\nThe Beethoven X DAO Treasury should strive to fulfill a purpose in all actions taken from its usage.\n\n\nTenets are goals or intent that the treasury should fulfill and are ordered in priority. This means that Tenet 1 has a higher priority than Tenet 2 and so on. Tenet 1 and Tenet 2 also have a “prereq” attribute, meaning these Tenets must be fulfilled before any funds can be allocated to the following Tenet. Tenets become the baseline that sustains an active treasury. Any BIP that is targeting the use of treasury assets will be assessed against the Tenets and needs to fulfill at least one of them.\n\n\nThe Risk Framework is then the required guardrail to sustain a safe treasury. The risk framework defines levels from 0 to 3 (Minimal, Low, Medium, and High), with each risk level having a maximum allocation to ensure the treasury risks are diversified. If a maximum allocation of a higher risk level is not fully utilized, the remainder can be used in a lower risk level.\n\nTogether with the framework the following definitions will be used:\n- “Total Treasury”, which refers to all assets controlled by the DAO treasury\n- “Active Treasury”, is a subgroup of Total Treasury that excludes assets with specific limits set to their usage, such as BEETS held in the wallet or assets received by treasury swaps and/or grant programs.\nMaximum allocations for various risk levels will be set based on the values of Active Treasury.\n\nIn general, the music directors will assess the treasury assets every 6 months and process any necessary rebalancing steps to make sure the treasury allocation conforms with this BIP. Such actions could entail moving funds to lower risk levels or higher priority tenets.\n\n\n\n## Risk Framework:\nThe Beethoven X DAO will be implementing a Risk Framework divided by levels:\n\n### Risk Level 0: Minimal\nMaximum Allocation: None.\nMinimal Risk includes the least amount of risk that the treasury can maintain and still function. Minimal smart contract risk. Minimal surface of attack.\n\nExample: \nAssets to be held in the different Beethoven X DAO multisigs.\nAssets earmarked as part of a grant.\n\n### Risk Level 1: Low\nMaximum Allocation: 50% of Active Treasury\nLow Risk represents an entry level risk for simple or yield-bearing assets that still allows to compose them onto DeFi to accumulate yield.\n\nExample:\nAssets may be composed on non boosted Pools (Stable or Weighted) on the Balancer Ecosystem.\nAssets may be lent.\n\n### Risk Level 2: Medium\nMaximum Allocation: 30% of Active Treasury\nMedium Risk represents the allowances to increase treasury yield by interacting with the Balancer Ecosystem through the composition of smart contracts.\n\nExample:\nAssets to be composed on Pools (Stable or Weighted) with a seasoned or proven Boost.\n\n### Risk Level 3: High\nMaximum Allocation: 20% of Active Treasury\nHigh Risk represents top strategies meant to maximize return on treasury assets.\n\nExample:\nAssets may be composed on Pools (Stable or Weighted) with experimental Boost (Concentrated Liquidity, Multistrat smart contracts, New partners).\nAny borrowing/leveraging activity falls within this risk level.\n\n### Tenet 1: Bug Bounty Safeguard and Liquidity Management\n\n**Objective**\nBeethoven X DAO pledges to maintain a sufficient level of liquidity to allow payment of a critical bug disclosed via our bug bounty program as per BIP-26. Adequate funding will be earmarked and accounted for from the Treasury to ensure the correct identification and actions related to this Tenet.\n\n**Specification**\nPrereq tenet with a specified cap of $200k USD in native stables in our multisig wallet (Risk 0)\n\n### Tenet 2: Core Contributor Funding and Retention\n\n**Objective**\nBeethoven X DAO commits to maintaining Core Contributor funding at a level of 12 months or above, taking into account the rationale of BIP-40 and BIP-56. Adequate funding will be allocated from the Treasury in stable assets to the Core Contributors' wallet to ensure the continuity of development efforts and retain key contributors who drive the project's success.\n\n**Specification** \nPrereq tenet with a specified as 12 times the monthly cost of contributor and infrastructure payments, currently totalling to $450k USD is calculated as the yearly amount based on the values currently set for Contributor payments under BIP-55 ($35k per month) and Infrastructure payments under BIP-56 ($2.5k per month): 12x($35k+$2.5k)=$450k.\n\nAt least half of the cap ($225k) must be held in native stables in our multisig wallet (Risk 0). Any remainder can be held in stable assets under Risk 1 (e.g. stable pools). Any funds that are not needed for Tenet 1 can be utilized for this Tenet.\n\n\n### Tenet 3: Provide Protocol Owned Assets on Beethoven X deployments to grow treasury and/or increase protocol revenue through fees\n\n**Objective** \nBeethoven X DAO will strive to actively use protocol owned assets as a tool to maintain, sustain or increase its total revenue.\n\n**Specification**\nAssets on both Fantom and Optimism deployments can be used following the Tenet prioritization and Risk Framework\nBPT can be staked on external projects (e.g. AURA) to maximize return.\n\n### Tenet 4: Empower the Optimism Deployment through increasing  veBAL & vlAURA Ecosystem Share\n\n**Objective** \nBeethoven X DAO will strategically increase its share on the Balancer ecosystem (veBAL & vlAURA) to further empower the Optimism deployment, aligning with the objectives of BIP-44. By holding these assets, the DAO gains voting power to direct emissions and incentivize pools on the Optimism chain, which is expected to increase total value locked (TVL) and revenue for the protocol.\n\n**Specification**\nAssets can be used to hold DAO owned vlAURA orDAO owned veBAL.\n\n### Tenet 5: Deposit Treasury assets in external protocols to increase treasury revenue\n\n**Objective**\nBeethoven X DAO will judiciously allocate treasury assets to external protocols that serve the purpose of increasing treasury value.\n\n**Specification**\nDAO assets can be deposited in external projects as non-BPTs.\n\n# Impacts/Risk Assessment:\nActive treasury management will increase the risk for the Beethoven X treasury, there is no way around this issue. The tenets and risk framework will serve as a guiding point so it can be understood what is the correct r/r (revenue/risk) of a given strategy.\n\nTenet and Risk framework adherence will be actioned every six months with the Composers and Music Directors having the provision to act on an emergency situation to unwind any position deemed at risk.\n\n\n# Specification/Execution Plan:\nIf approved the Composers and Music Directors will: \nFor Tenet 1 and 2, accounting already has the assets correctly identified.\nFor Tenet 3, 4 and 5, individual strategies are already in place and if approved as a BIP, any future treasury allocation will need to be structured to follow the tenets.\n\n\n\n![image](ipfs://bafybeifljmboyginmb5mhdde2sxfccfppxemivq5lxusjxc5qnrsdj5gei)",

      "title": "BIP-55: Extending Treasury Funding for Beethoven X DAO Contributors",
      "content": "## Introduction and Motivation\nSince the adoption of BIP-40 in April 2023, Beethoven X DAO contributors have been receiving funding of $35k per month from the Treasury. This financial contribution (and it’s predecessor, BIP-35 in October 2022) from the DAO play a vital role in retaining and attracting key contributors to work on advancing Beethoven X. During this past funding period, the Balancer service provider agreements have also significantly contributed by offsetting DAO Contributor costs by up to $55k per month. Without these two sources of funding for contributors, it would be impossible to keep the protocol operating. Now, we propose to continue this funding arrangement, for a minimum of $35k per month, from the Treasury for a further 6 months from November 2023 to the end of April 2024.\n\nIn the face of prevailing challenging (but improving) market conditions, the Beethoven DAO remains steadfastly committed and highly motivated to overcome the current difficulties and continue advancing the protocol. Our unwavering dedication stems from the belief that we are well-positioned to emerge at the forefront and fully capitalise on the potential rewards that more positive market sentiment can bring.\n\n## Background\nEver since the earliest bootstrapping phases of Beethoven X, the Beethoven DAO and its contributors have been able to finance operations from the activity of the protocol. Today the DAO is instrumental in ensuring maintaining a high functioning and operational team that is active in the best interest of the protocol. \n\nPrior to BIP-40, and its predecessor BIP-35, Beethoven X underwent severe cost cutting measures throughout 2022. The contributors diligently reduced costs, decreasing headcount from 12.5 to approx. 8.5 and even implemented a 50% compensation cut across the board in July 2022. Thankfully, since BIP-35 compensations have been raised to 75% and since BIP-40 to 90% of pre-cut compensation levels. This was enabled by the Balancer service provider agreements, which provided an additional revenue stream for the DAO, which can be used for funding contributors. These proposals have facilitated our continued focus on development and allowed Beethoven X DAO Contributors to maintain the headcount of approx. 9.5 FTE (full time equivalents) over the past 6 months. These resources are divided as follows:\n\n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreieqvwv2ofuaoxas2f67kanzgegenrus23lyaygbpnpddm2ofv67lm)\n    \n\nWe expect primary DAO contributor resources to continue at this approximate level for the next 6 months.\n\nBeethoven X's commitment to state-of-the-art technology and a decentralised, transparent, and censorship-resistant community remains unwavering. The additional funding from the Treasury, combined with the contributions from Balancer, has allowed our DAO contributors to stay dedicated to this vision. Noteworthy achievements in the past 6 months include:\n- Executing Balancer Marketing & Streamlining Balancer and Beethoven Marketing Efforts\n- Successfully onboarded a full time resource to focus solely on Beethoven X Community and Marketing\n- Co-Building new Balancer frontend which will also replace the current Beethoven X frontend in the near future\n- Actively Contributing to the technical vision and further development of Balancer core technologies\n- Navigating the Multichain and BAL Boosted Pool Vulnerabilities in the Summer of 2022\n- Re-Introducing Boosted & yield bearing Pools on Optimism and Fantom\nRedesigning Gauge Voting\n- Launch of CL pools on Optimism supported by our UI\n- Strong collaboration with the Aura ecosystem\n- Integration of Balancer into our API infrastructure\n- Development of various new strategies for Beethoven X DAO treasury and maintaining them\n\nThe market conditions after a strong Q1 in 2023 remain challenging for the DAO treasury. During this previous funding period, we have observed a steady decline in fees on the Fantom network, particularly since the Multichain incident. On the Optimism network, fees reached their peak in Q2, and despite fluctuations, Q3 still witnessed higher monthly revenues on aggregate compared to Q1. On the Optimism Deployment the trend has been more positive, currently the first batch of Optimism fees for the month of October came in 60% higher than the September bi-monthly fees. The latest developments in “Uptober” also have provided welcome relief and increased the positive sentiment to the future. We sincerely hope this will carry into 2024 and see volume and activity of the protocol steadily increase again. \n\nAs of November 4th, the Beethoven X Treasury holds assets worth over $2,715,116, with $2,015,588 in assets that are not BEETS or OP tokens. Treasury assets can be seen here:\nFantom: https://debank.com/profile/0xa1e849b1d6c2fd31c63eef7822e9e0632411ada7\nOptimism: https://debank.com/profile/0x2a185c8a3c63d7bfe63ad5d950244ffe9d0a4b60\nEthereum: https://debank.com/profile/0xea06e1b4259730724885a39ce3ca670efb020e26\n\n## Proposal\nThis proposal, if adopted, will continue our funding at $35k per month for the next six months, covering the period from October 2023 to the end of March 2024. This extension will provide us with the necessary resources to maintain and enhance the Beethoven X platform while solidifying our collaboration with Balancer.\n\nIn conclusion, we emphasize the importance of maintaining financial stability during these challenging market conditions. By extending this funding proposal, we aim to secure our position and be prepared to seize opportunities in a more favourable market environment, which we anticipate will return in the near future.\n\nWe appreciate your consideration and support in ensuring the continued growth and development of Beethoven X.\n\nThank you for your time and attention.\nImpact for the 6 months\n Team – Step 1: DAO Contributors will receive an aggregate fixed $35k per month ($210k in total) Budget in USDC from the Treasury. In addition, Step 2, as long as the Beethoven X-Balancer service provider agreement remains unchanged : 55k in Revenue from the service provider agreement with Balancer is paid into Treasury and will be used to fund the core contributor wallet.\n\nTreasury – Treasury assumes a fixed monthly cost of $35k per month ($210k in total) in USDC and passes the 55k (or any new equivalent arising from SP contracts) in USDC received from the Beethoven X-Balancer service provider agreement onwards, to be used for the payment of DAO Contributors.\n\nTokenomics – No impact\n\nCommittees – No impact\n\n## Specification\nEach month, $35k USDC from Treasury and, upon request, any USDC received by Treasury for service provider agreements with Balancer DAO will be sent to the wallet: 0x0EDfcc1b8D082Cd46d13Db694b849D7d8151C6D5 (or another wallet designated for the payment of contributors). No additional work or modification to status quo operations is required.\n\n## Execution Plan\nUpon approval, the Treasury will send $35k in USDC to the team wallet for each month spanning this proposal. Treasury will periodically transfer funds from the anticipated Balancer DAO service provider agreements to the same wallet. These authorizations will take effect immediately as under BIP-40, 6x payments for 35k USDC have been completed to-date. Therefore the 1st payment will be in November to cover October 2023 and the subsequent one in the beginning of December for the month of November. This will continue with the last payment (6th payment) being the payment for the month of March 2024 in the beginning of April 2024.",

      "content": "## Introduction and Motivation\nStarting in February 2022 community member mobiusTripper built a website to display data relating to gauge voting. This site is better knows as beetswars.live. mobiusTripper has paid to keep the server active since its inception. This proposal requests reimbursement for the server costs associated with that website.\n\n## Background\nmobiusTripper built and maintained the beetswars.live website starting in 2022. The data displayed allows community members to make an informed decision regarding their gauge votes. Additionally, Beets community members onkeljoe and RzN extended the functionality to added historical graphs and an API to make the historical data publicly available. That data is now used to augment maBEETS ROI data which is displayed in the main BeethovenX website.\n\nAlthough there are free options available to host websites, a Vercel Pro account was chosen to allow the use of a dedicated domain name and provide reliable server responses.\n\n## Proposal\nThis proposal, if adopted, will reimburse mobiusTripper for the past costs to keep the beetswars.live website active. Additionally 10,000 BEETS tokens will be transferred to each of the beetswars team members (onkeljoe and RzN and mobiusTripper).\n\n## Specification\nbeetswars.live is hosted on Vercel using a Pro account. This is $20 per month. Starting in February 2022 to present that total expense to mobiustripper has been $400.\n\n## Execution Plan\nUpon approval, the Treasury will send $400 in USDC on Optimism network to the wallet specified by mobiusTripper. Also 10,000 BEETS token on the Fantom network will be transferred to mobiusTripper and onkeljoe and RzN each.",

      "title": "BIP-54: Infrastructure Funding Extension and Cap Adjustment for October 2023 - March 2024",
      "content": "## Intro\nBuilding upon the previous arrangements outlined in BIP-23, BIP-36 and BIP-41, the treasury has been responsible for covering the infrastructure costs associated with the operation of beets.fi. The prevailing conditions are as follows:\n- Infrastructure cost claims have been capped at $7.5k per month as of the last BIP.\n- Contributors are encouraged to continue finding avenues for cost reduction.\n\nThis proposal aims to extend the funding of infrastructure costs by the DAO Treasury for another six months until the end of March 2024, with a further adjusted monthly cap set at $2500. \n\n## Motivation\nDue to the joint development of the backend infrastructure together with Balancer and the integration of the Balancer chains into the backend infrastructure, it was decided that the infrastructure will be hosted in Balancer's AWS account. Therefore, this cost is no longer carried by Beethoven X DAO.\n\nBelow you can see that the migration of the infrastructure in June and July resulted in a significant drop in expenses.\n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreigia6xrayvrie4xaq2rqxbiar2utzr5eeokszat74wlo4ytcvvq3q)\n    \nCurrently the market is still slow and not many requests are being served. Once the market picks up and more requests need to be served, the cost will increase again. This is why we still ask for a cap of $2.5k which will cover higher load on our infrastructure.\n\nSince the infrastructure is now running under Balancer’s AWS account, it is likely that Beethoven X DAO will be asked to pay a share of the cost, proportional to our usage. We believe that this will be less that what we paid monthly over the last 6 months, since infrastructure consolidation helps reduce cost overall.\n\n## Risks\nPotential risks of cost inflation due to unpredictable factors like surges in user traffic continue to exist. In case of such overspends, separate proposals will be presented for community approval.\n\n## Impacts and Specification\nTreasury: Will shoulder the new monthly infrastructure cost cap of $2500.\n\nImpact on Previous BIPs: This BIP serves as an extension and modification of the most recent BIP that concluded in September 2023.\n\nTeam: No impact.\n\nOther Contractors or Consultants: None.\n\nTokenomics: None.\n\nOther Committees Recognized by the DAO: None.\n\n## Execution Plan\nThe DAO treasury will cover the infrastructure costs up to a maximum of $2500 per month for the next seven months, starting in October 2023 and ending in March 2024. This represents a potential maximum expenditure of $15,000 for this period.",

      "title": "BIP-53: Decision on how to proceed regarding the Boosted Pools incident",
      "content": "### Intro:\nStarting on the morning of 27 Aug 2023 Beethoven X experienced multiple attacks on both the Fantom and Optimism deployments, with a total loss of around $1.1M on Fantom and $320k on Optimism. Balancer released a full technical postmortem report here: https://medium.com/balancer-protocol/rate-manipulation-in-balancer-boosted-pools-technical-postmortem-53db4b642492 and Beethoven’s perspective and time-line can be seen here: https://medium.com/beethoven-x/rate-manipulation-in-balancer-boosted-pools-a-beethoven-x-perspective-e419bbb66592. The vulnerability was publicly disclosed to the user base on 22 Aug 2023.\n\n### Motivation:\nThere are always risks in DeFi, which can be mitigated by audits and due diligence, but never completely avoided. Multiple protocols have experienced exploits and there’s no one way to proceed if such an incident occurs. \n\nA discussion was started in the governance channel of Beethoven X discord regarding what steps should the Beethoven X DAO take. The discussion was not deemed sufficient to decide on how to proceed without a vote, which is why the current BIP was created.\n\nIt is important to note that even though Beethoven X suffered attacks on two different chains, then there are important differences between the deployments and thus the decided outcome may vary too. The Optimism deployment is set up as a partnership between Beethoven X and Balancer. Balancer has decided to build a facility for users to report potential losses, which also includes the joint Optimism deployment: https://snapshot.org/#/balancer.eth/proposal/0x576e698cd8649dd6a6a2456f06c4648bb0d95e35da000c51c82f243774b7ef9f. Their reasoning here is that a large portion of the liquidity might be stale (no longer actively managed) and therefore simply airdropping a full reinstitution of the funds does not seem adequate. After this system has been built, users will be given 60 days to report their loss and following decisions will be based on that information. While Beethoven X contributors will offer Balancer their assistance with this task, the Optimism reimbursement will be based on Balancer's timeline and the final decision will need to be agreed upon by both DAOs.\n  \nThe subject of this proposal is the Fantom deployment, where the loss was considerably higher and where Beethoven X DAO can decide how to proceed on its own. Similarly to Balancer’s arguments, the full reimbursement of the funds through simply airdropping to affected wallets does not seem adequate, so this vote will decide whether we should proceed by setting up a similar system to Balancer. This gives the possibility to further analyze the losses and provide various options for potential reimbursement. Voting YES means Beethoven X contributors will work on creating such a system, the actual reimbursement would be decided by the following vote. Voting NO means this system will not be created and no reimbursement will be carried out for the losses on Fantom deployment. This BIP should be considered as an isolated response to a specific event and not be considered a precedent setting.\n\n### Impacts/Risk Assessment:\nThere are no specific impacts for voting YES to this proposal, other than the work that needs to be conducted to set up the reporting system and analyze the results. Any actual decision would be decided by a following vote. \n\nVoting NO to this proposal means that no reimbursement will be carried out. It is difficult to assess potential impacts/risks with such a decision, since the view would be subjective to every user. Even though the decision should be considered as a separate event, then as an assumption one could consider decreased trust in Beethoven X to reimburse user losses in the future as a potential negative impact.\n\n### Specification/Execution Plan:\nThe passing of this BIP would mean that Beethoven X contributors will:\n 1) Build a system/facility for users to report their loss of funds. \n 2) When created, widely announce and give users 60 days to report their loss.\n 3) Analyze the data and report the findings.\n 4) Put up a following governance vote to decide on how to proceed based on the results.",

      "title": "BIP-52: Deploy BEETS POL & bribe with Treasury Earnings on Optimism",
      "content": "## This proposal has two parts:\n1) Deploy $100k of Protocol Owned Liquidity (POL) as a BEETS/rETH 80/20 weighted pool on Beethoven X / Balancer Optimism\n2) Enable redirection of a portion of Treasury revenue to vlAURA/veBAL bribes for the BEETS/rETH pool, with any additional emissions earnt by the POL also able to be used as bribes in subsequent gauge rounds.\n\n## Motivation: \nThis proposal would serve to increase BEETS liquidity on Optimism and seed the new bridged version of BEETS, while also allowing accelerated acquisition of veBAL & vlAURA by Beethoven X DAO Treasury.\n\nThe BEETS liquidity currently on Optimism was bridged using the now non-functional Multichain service, and Beethoven X / Balancer on Optimism currently hosts ~$6.5k of BEETS within a 40/40/20 liquidity pool. Deployment of a new version of bridged BEETS on Optimism was approved in BIP-49 and with technical components of that work nearing completion there will be need for liquidity in the new token.\n\nBeethoven X DAO Treasury is well positioned to provide this liquidity, and would have the ability to benefit from the positive yield effects of the veBAL / vlAURA gauge systems.\n\nBy using a portion of Optimism DEx revenue currently earmarked for purchasing AURA / BAL to instead place gauge vote bribes we can direct AURA & BAL emissions to the pool with an expectation of increased acquisition as long as net veBAL / vlAURA bribe market ROI is positive. \n\nThe bribe ROI effect is currently further aided by Aura’s OP grant distribution program, which emits additional OP to gauge pools on Aura. Beethoven X DAO Treasury could benefit from this additional earning directly, and also by using the earnt OP as bribes to accelerate veBAL / vlAURA acquisition while bribe market ROI is positive. \n\n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreigf7iertjjbk7ap2piglamhpxijr7wlglaynwt57mhmagodt2ht2e)\n\nThe above flowchart illustrates the proposed additional mechanism for acquiring AURA & BAL, whereas currently the 10% of Optimism DEx revenue is used to directly purchase AURA / BAL for locking. This process would only be followed while there is expected gain from doing so, otherwise the existing process to purchase AURA & BAL will be used.\n\n## Impacts/Risk Assessment:\n - Granting the ability to acquire vlAURA / veBAL through either purchase or gauge would allow flexibility to optimise accumulation rate per $ of Optimism DEx revenue. This could be used to accelerate accumulation and/or to free up cashflow for alternative uses.\n - The ability to accelerate vlAURA / veBAL accumulation would allow increased discretion to direct incentives to pools on the Optimism DEx, thereby potentially increasing overall Beethoven X protocol and DAO revenue.\n - The process would require an extra stage of calculation and action by DAO contributors in the fortnightly and monthly protocol fee processing cycles. This represents increased workload while also increasing uncertainty of vlAURA / veBAL acquisition rate due to added delays in realising the AURA/BAL and the changeability inherent in bribe markets relying on volatile tokens.\n - The added complexity and changeability increases the risk of negative net gain, which in practice could be reduced by MDs factoring in a buffer in bribe ROI calculations. \n - This pool would affect the dynamics of BEETS liquidity, likely increasing correlation to rETH while also deepening overall BEETS liquidity. \n - The movement of BEETS from Treasury's wallet on Fantom to Beethoven X / Aura on Optimism represents increased bridge risk for BEETS token and greater exposure of Treasury assets to Aura Finance.\n - The gauge related components of this proposal are dependent on approval by Balancer and integration of the pool with Aura.\n\n## Specification/Execution Plan:\nWith approval of this proposal, $80k of BEETS and $20k of rETH of POL will be used to seed a BEETS/rETH 80/20 pool on Beethoven X Optimism. The BEETS used for the pool will be the new version of bridged BEETS which uses Layer Zero’s OFT standard. Separately from this proposal, DAO contributors will also apply to Balancer governance for a gauge to allow direction of BAL & AURA emissions to the pool.\n\nWhen the Balancer gauge is in place, Music Director’s will have the options to:\n 1) Place bribes for the pool instead of, or in addition to, purchasing AURA & BAL directly\n 2) Use additional emissions earnt by the POL as bribes for the pool\n\nThe aim would be to acquire a greater total value of AURA & BAL through the process, and so it would only be employed during times of expected overall gain for DAO Treasury. The amount of Optimism DEx revenue used as bribes may vary from 0-100% of the portion allocated to acquiring vlAURA & veBAL, according to bribe market and pool dynamics, with an aim of optimising returns for the DAO.",

      "title": "BIP-51: Diversifying the Gauge Bounties",
      "content": "## Proposal\n\nThis proposal presents an opportunity to reassess and diversify the current reliance on bought-back BEETS as a means to incentivize maBEETS voters. The proposal seeks to replace the current model with one that rewards these holders with Beethoven X BPTs rather than BEETS tokens, essentially providing users with a basket of assets. This provides maBEETS voters with real yield and encourages it to stay. In addition to this the following BIP outlines an avenue for the use of the FTM gas monetization money as a means to bolster these incentives. In order to achieve these goals a number of actions will be required as outlined below.\n\n1) Change buy back from protocol fees\n2) Allocate quarterly reward from the FTM Gas Monetization Program\n\n## Motivation\nAs stated above, the goal of this proposal is to diversify the gauge bounties incentives. The proposal is split into different sections that all aim for this goal but in different ways.\n\n1) Change buy back from protocol fees\n\nWith the approval of BIP-24 (https://snapshot.org/#/beets.eth/proposal/0xe1489639baffe5bb8117da677349a67e80197ab6d34d5efb1b49786ca76cf83a), BeethovenX DAO started buying BEETS with 30% of protocol fees earned each month. These have been distributed as gauge vote incentives for top performing pools. \n\nAllocating 30% of protocol fees towards gauge bounties for top performing pools had a positive impact on the performance of these pools, there is no intention to change this. However, the proposal is to stop buying back BEETS with 30% of protocol fees and instead use the fees to convert into a BPT and distribute such BPT as voting incentives. Which BPT it is converted to will be up to the Music Directors discretion, but will most likely be a BPT of a top performing pool.\n\nThis change should achieve the following:\na) Add real yield as voting incentives\nb) Chain aligned voting incentives\nc) We generate TVL by converting to BPTs\nd) BPTs are value accruing, as swap fees are compounded into them\ne) maBEETS voters are more likely to stake the BPTs\n2) Allocate reward from the FTM Gas Monetization Program\n\nFantom runs a program where 15% of the gas used by enrolled dApps can be earned back via the Gas Monetization program. In addition, a quarterly bonus is paid out to the top projects as ranked by total gas usage of their included contracts. Details of the program can be seen here: https://fantom.foundation/blog/gas-monetization-introducing-the-quarterly-bonus/\n\nThe total earn rate will be volatile and subject to changing network and dApp usage but calculations using data from the last 3 months shows monthly earnings of ~27000 FTM, including the quarterly bonus. This calculation was made during an extraordinary period (Multichain incident) so future numbers may differ.\n\nThe earned rewards do not currently have a specified use and are accumulating in the DAO Treasury. This proposal would see up to 100% of the rewards from this program be used as Beethoven-X gauge vote bounties, with allocation between gauge pools kept proportional to the value of publicized gauge bounties. This allocation would include all gauge bounties -  whether posted by Beethoven-X or by third parties, although Music Directors would retain the right to exclude specific bounties from the program in cases of potential exploitation of the system. An example of such cases would be where a bounty is placed using a high nominal value of a relatively illiquid asset for which realization of the nominal value can not be reasonably expected for those receiving the bounty.\n\nThe motivation for this proposed change is to increase incentives for participation in Beethoven-X governance.\n\n## Impacts/Risk Assessment\n\nThis proposal would mean increased gauge vote incentives without diluting potential third party bounties increasing participation in the maBEETS governance system.\n\nThe use of Gas Monetization rewards in this involves a reduction in DAO Treasury retained earnings, although the change may potentially contribute to greater overall earnings through increased maBEETS participation. \nThe distribution method used may entail fees being paid to third parties (for example Votehoven), which reduces their value to the DAO by a corresponding amount. \n\n## Specification/Execution Plan\nFollowing the adoption of this BIP the Composers and Music Directors will change the methodology that was being used for buybacks in regards to maBEETS voting incentives and use the USDC fees earned to create BPTs and use these as voting incentives\nGas monetization rewards will be harvested on a monthly basis, with each month’s rewards being applied to the following month’s gauge votes and the quarterly bonus being divided equally over votes in the following quarter.\nDistribution of these added bounties would be via a mechanism decided by Music Directors, and would likely follow the same route as the existing protocol supplied maBEETS gauge bounties. For clarity, the currently used mechanism is distribution via Votehoven.",

      "title": "BIP-50: Reimburse Users of DDB Pool",
      "content": "**Proposal**\nUse DAO Treasury funds to reimburse losses to those users affected by the misconfiguration and subsequent exploit of the first incentivised iteration of the Dollar Dollar Bills pool on Optimism. \n\nThis proposal is to use USDC and/or USDT to reimburse users with the entire value of losses as priced in USDC at the time of loss.\n\n--------------------------------\n\n**Background and Motivation**\nThe affected pool (ERN / bb-rf-USDC / bb-rf-USDT) with contract address 0x7FE29a818438Ed2759e30f65c2302295711d66Fc was launched with incentives in July 2023. A misconfiguration was identified and users were instructed to move funds to a replacement version of the pool, but unfortunately the misconfiguration allowed a bad actor to exploit the pool and led to loss of user funds valued at approximately $79k. \n\nPlease see the below Post-Mortem Report for details of the events leading to the loss of user funds.\n<https://beethovenxio.medium.com/dollar-dollar-bills-post-mortem-4cf46a2ccad4>\n\nPool creation is permissionless but this particular pool was created and promoted by Beethoven-X core contributors and official communication channels, so there is arguably greater responsibility of Beethoven-X DAO for the loss to users.\n\nThe incident and a potential reimbursement plan has been discussed in public channels of Beethoven-X Discord server. Please see there for motivations raised by various DAO members, but reasons for reimbursement include maintaining trust in Beethoven-X’s execution of Balancer technology.\n\n--------------------------------\n\n**Impacts/Risk Assessment**\nThis proposal would see users affected by this incident entirely reimbursed for the value of their pooled token losses. This would likely have a significant positive impact on these affected individuals. Such a move may help to engender trust in Beethoven-X and hence aid liquidity attraction efforts; but the predominant driver of TVL will likely remain swap fees, technology, and incentives. \n\nNot reimbursing users may result in significant damage to the relationship between users and Beethoven-X DAO, and by extension with Beethoven-X as a protocol.\n\nThe DAO Treasury would be affected by a reduction of balances, with the distribution of ~$79k amounting to approximately 6.5 times the Treasury earnings from protocol swap and yield fees for the month of July 2023. As well as the reduction in nominal value, this will also affect considerations of Treasury deployment and likely mean a reduction in the percentage of Treasury funds actively deployed in liquidity pools or other revenue generation positions.\n\nThere is also a risk that enacting this proposal may in future be taken as precedent for using DAO Treasury funds to replace losses faced by users in future adverse events. This could theoretically lead to further significant drawdowns of DAO Treasury, though approval of such actions would generally go through Beethoven-X governance. If this was to occur, then Beethoven-X may lose the ability to fund ongoing infrastructure and operations.\n\n--------------------------------\n\n**Specification/Execution Plan**\nA list of affected addresses will be compiled and verified, with losses of each address calculated in USDC equivalent (using prices at time of loss) and used to determine the value of USDC and/or USDT tokens for distribution to each affected address.\n\nBeethoven-X Composers and Music Directors will coordinate and execute a series of transactions to distribute the tokens to those users affected by the exploit of the pool, with funds being sourced from Beethoven-X DAO Treasury on Ethereum, Optimism, and or Fantom.\n\n--------------------------------\n\nVote Options:\nYes, reimburse users fully with USDC/USDT\nNo, further discussion is needed",

      "title": "BIP-49: Migrating Bridged Beets on Optimism",
      "content": "## Summary\nThis proposal concerns the migration plan for BEETS token on Optimism, currently issued by the Multichain Bridge. \n\n## Background and Motivation\nSince the joint Balancer and Beethoven X deployment on Optimism, BEETS token has been bridged to Optimism to be used for liquidity bootstrapping. The current BEETS token on Optimism is a bridged token issued by the Multichain bridge, deployed in May 2022. As the Multichain Bridge was hacked and has since ceased functioning, the BEETS token on Optimism can no longer be bridged back to Fantom, and has become effectively isolated. Currently, about 2.85M BEETS tokens are bridged to Optimism (which means that on Fantom, around 2.85M BEETS are stored inside anyBEETS, the multichain bridge contract). Among the 2.85M bridged BEETS, around 1.1M is currently held by Beethoven X treasury. \n\nThis proposal seeks to migrate the bridged BEETS token on Optimism, and resume the bridging functionality between the native BEETS token on Fantom and Optimism (possibly other chains as well). \n\n## New Bridge for BEETS\nA new bridge has to be used to facilitate the transfer of BEETS between Fantom and Optimism. The proposal recommends using the OFT standard from Layer Zero to deploy a new bridged BEETS token on Optimism (l0BEETS in short). As an advantage of building on the OFT standard, Beethoven X admin maintains full control of the contracts, and is hence not vulnerable to the potential exploits that can come with third party bridging contracts or being exposed to a third party custodian. Since the OFT standard does not require liquidity for bridging, BEETS will be easily supported by Stargate to be bridged between Fantom and Optimism, and potentially other chains. \n\n## Migration of multiBEETS to l0BEETS \nSince there are around 2.85M multiBEETS on Optimism, to make it possible for users to bridge those back to Fantom, a migration contract of multiBEETS to l0BEETS has to be deployed. For such a migration, native BEETS need to be bridged from Fantom to Optimism using the new bridge to supply l0BEETS on Optimism, and then users can swap multiBEETS to l0BEETS. The proposal asks the DAO Treasury to supply this amount for migration purposes. \n\n## Specification \nThis proposal seeks to migrate bridged BEETS token to Optimism, specifically:\n1. Deploy Layer Zero bridged BEETS (l0BEETS) on Optimism.\n2. Send 2.85M BEETS from Beethoven X Dao Treasury on Fantom to Optimism for migration.\n3. Deploy contract and UI for migrating multiBEETS to l0BEETS on Optimism.\n \n## Risk Assessment \nEach bridge comes with its own risk, as clearly indicated by the Multichain incidence. From talking with various bridge teams and other protocols, the Beethoven X DAO core contributors conclude that Layer Zero is a reasonable choice for the bridging solution. \n\nThere is the possibility that the 2.85M BEETS held by the multichain bridge contract on Fantom may be released by a malicious actor and thus enter circulation. The only way to mitigate the risk is to redeploy the BEETS token on Fantom all together, which, while possible, would mean a complete overhaul of the existing masterchef contract (since BEETS on Fantom is minted by masterchef) together with maBEETS. Given that 2.85M BEETS consists of less than 1% of the current total supply of BEETS, it is currently not worth the trouble to revamp the native BEETS token. \n\nAs the multichain bridged BEETS token is controlled by multichain, it is also possible that a malicious actor mints additional multiBEETS tokens on Optimism and potentially uses the migration contract to swap to l0BEETS. This risk is partially mitigated by the migration contract only supplying a limited amount of l0BEETS; moreover, Beethoven X contributors should try to make sure all multiBEETS holders on Optimism migrate as soon as possible after the migration is available. It is also recommended that the migration is made available only for a limited period of time to further reduce this risk.",

      "title": "BIP-48: Deposit treasury ETH to Gyroscope E-CLP on Optimism",
      "content": "## Summary\nUse a portion of DAO Treasury ETH to farm a position in Gyroscope’s Elliptical Concentrated Liquidity Pool (E-CLP) for wETH-wstETH on Beethoven-X/Balancer Optimism.\n\n## Proposal\nThis proposal would grant Music Directors the ability to move treasury assets to Gyroscope E-CLPs on Optimism, being a new protocol for Treasury assets. Governance approval is required prior to Treasury funds being deposited with a new protocol. \n\nThe proposal also includes a first action of moving 53 ETH (~$100k) of the DAO Treasury ETH to the Gyroscope E-CLP wETH-wsETH position on Optimism, and staking the resulting BPT on Aura Finance in order to gain boosted BAL, and AURA emissions. Staking the E-CLP BPT on Aura Finance would only be done if the separate governance proposal to allow farming on Aura is approved.\n\nThis amount would not count towards the existing $200k monthly discretionary treasury asset reallocation limit, but any further deposits to Gyroscope E-CLPs would be subject to that limit unless otherwise approved by governance.\n\n## Motivations\nThis proposal is part of a series of BIPs aiming to get our Treasury assets back to earning following the removal of Multichain bridged assets from Fantom in early June. \n\nGranting the ability to deposit DAO Treasury assets within Gyroscope E-CLPs on Optimism allows for an additional source of trading fee earnings as well as BAL/AURA emissions via farming on Beethoven-X and Aura (pending other BIP enabling farming there). The proposed asset movement would aid synergies with Treasury veBAL/vlAURA at times when gauge voting power is directed towards the wstETH/wETH E-CLP. It also demonstrates support for protocols building on Balancer/Beethoven-X and may contribute to a stronger business relationship with Gyroscope.\n\n## Impacts/Risk Assessment\nMoving Treasury assets as proposed introduces an added layer of smart contract risk specific to Gyroscope's E-CLP technology. Gyroscope underwent auditing by Nethermind and Trail of Bits in August and September of 2022, but it is a relatively new protocol having been testing live since November 2022 with gradual ramp up to current TVL of $3.0M (as per Gyroscope website). Gyroscope smart contacts have recently undergone a further external security audit but the report of this is yet to be published. The relative newness of E-CLPs could be considered to entail a higher risk profile than more battle-tested pool architecture technologies.\n\nThis proposal also entails taking on smart contract, organizational, and market risks of holding and LPing Lido's wstETH. Lido currently secures upwards of $14B as stETH/wstETH, has a $2M bug bounty program, and has undergone multiple rounds of security auditing. stETH has been traded for more than 30 months and has a track record of tight peg to ETH over the long-term.\n\n## Specification/Execution Plan\nIf this proposal passes, MDs would have the ability to deposit DAO Treasury funds within Gyroscope E-CLPs on Balancer/Beethoven-X Optimism. \n\n53 (~$100,000) DAO Treasury wETH would be bridged from Ethereum and used to form a Gyrosocpe ECLP wETH-wsETH BPT on Beethoven-X/Balancer Optimism. If the separate governance proposal to allow deposits with Aura Finance is passed, then the wETH-wstETH BPTs will be staked on Aura finance to earn boosted BAL as well as AURA emissions. \n\nAll movements of wETH and BPTs would be within or between the DAO Treasury addresses on Ethereum [0xea06e1b4259730724885a39ce3ca670efb020e26] and Optimism [0xea06e1b4259730724885a39ce3ca670efb020e26].\n\n### Some relevant Links\nwstETH-wETH Gyro E-CLP page - https://op.beets.fi/pool/0x7ca75bdea9dede97f8b13c6641b768650cb837820002000000000000000000d5\nGyroscope Finance webpage - https://gyro.finance/\nGyroscope docs/ audit reports - https://docs.gyro.finance/gyroscope-protocol/audit-reports",

      "title": "BIP-47: Allow Treasury Farming on Aura",
      "content": "## Proposal\nGrant Music Directors the ability to deposit DAO Treasury funds with Aura Finance, and to move the current Rocket Pool BPT holdings to Aura Finance in order to earn Aura and boosted BAL emissions. \n\nFurther deposits to Aura Finance would be limited by the existing $200,000 monthly Music Director discretionary limit, or otherwise require approval by governance.\n\n## Motivation\nThe Beethoven-X governance framework requires governance approval prior to depositing treasury funds into a new protocol. Moving funds to Aura allows a higher earnings rate of BAL for a given BPT by using Aura's veBAL boost, and additionally allows the earning of AURA. \n\nEarnings of BAL and AURA can be used as strategic assets, while also increasing total treasury holdings. \n\nThis proposal will be the first in a series of BIPs aiming to get our Treasury assets back to earning following the removal of Multichain bridged assets from Fantom in early June. The focus on approving Aura first is so we can make the most of the upcoming Aura earnings boost.\n\n## Impacts/Risk Assessment\n 1. Granting the ability to farm on Aura allows for higher earn rate on treasury assets \n 2. There would be an added layer of smart contract risk, but Aura Finance has a track record securing hundreds of millions of dollars on Ethereum and their Optimism contracts are covered by a one million dollar bug bounty as well as having undergone multiple rounds of security auditing. \n 3. Moving our BPT from staking directly on Beethoven-X/Balancer to staking on Aura does not remove the assets from Beethoven-X/Balancer liquidity pools.\n\n## Specification/Execution Plan\nFollowing approval of this proposal, Music Directors will have the ability to deposit DAO Treasury assets with Aura Finance. \n\nTreasury's existing Rocket Pool BPTs will be unstaked from Beethoven-X/Balancer and then staked on Aura Finance Optimism contracts. Otherwise the existing monthly discretionary limit of $200,000 will not be altered. BAL and AURA earned will be used to increase DAO Treasury veBAL and vlAURA holdings, though this may be changed by future governance vote. \n\nAll movements of BPTs, BAL and AURA will be within or between the DAO Treasury addresses on Ethereum [0xea06e1b4259730724885a39ce3ca670efb020e26](https://etherscan.io/address/0xea06e1b4259730724885a39ce3ca670efb020e26) and Optimism [0xea06e1b4259730724885a39ce3ca670efb020e26](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0xea06e1b4259730724885a39ce3ca670efb020e26).\n\nFurther information on Aura Finance can be accessed here: \nhttps://app.aura.finance/",

      "content": "With this proposal the gauge vote results would only be applied to pools without any multichain bridged assets (based on normal gauge vote rules). Music Directors are given the rights to distribute the rest.\n\n===========\n**Motivation**\nThe Multichain bridge situation is very alarming and we share the distress it has caused to our users. While fortunately almost all of the non-native Beethoven X treasury holdings have already been previously moved off Fantom, then we have to formulate a plan for how to proceed regarding the workings of the DEX itself. Multichain's situation is still currently unclear and multiple different projects have shown interest in having their tokens more prevalent on Fantom and Beethoven X. Due to all of this the situation is changing faster than it is suitable for our regular gauge vote routine. Until everything settles into place again we propose the following actions: \n\n1) Direct the gauge vote emissions only to pools without any Multichain bridged assets. Normal gauge vote rules would still apply. \n2) Give Music Directors the rights to direct the rest of the emissions. These would be used for bootstrapping new pools when new partnerships are formed or moved towards maBEETS pool to increase the revenue of maBEETS holders. \n3) If the situation is not clear before the next vote (with scheduled start on 20th July), then collected BEETS gauge vote incentives would still be distributed through the vote process, but the exact method will be decided later.\n\n===========\n**Impacts**\nThis proposal will certainly have an impact on the DEX short-term. The long term effects are unknown, but will be closely monitored with an aim to intervene and ameliorate significant negative impacts if they become apparent. When the situation resolves and everything settles into place, the usual routine would be restarted. Short term impacts would be the following: \n1) In the light of the Multichain’s situation, the pools containing Multichain bridged assets will very likely stop receiving BEETS incentives. \n2) Larger share of emissions will be decided by the Music Directors, which will be used to bootstrap new pools or moved to maBEETS pool. \n\n===========\n**Risk assessment**\nWhile the proposal intends to lower current risks, then potential risks to be considered are: \n1) Liquidity leaves the DEX from the pools where rewards will be stopped, but the current advice stands to de-risk from liquidity pools containing Multichain bridged assets. \n2) It is unknown how the situation proceeds and when it would be possible/suitable to start the normal routine.\n\n===========\n**Specification**\nThe Beethoven X contributors have the available tools/methods to implement the actions specified in the proposal.\n\n===========\n**Execution plan**\nFollowing successful vote, gauge vote results would be only applied to pools without any Multichain bridged tokens (usual rules would apply). Music Directors will be given rights to distribute the rest of the emissions to bootstrap new pools or to direct the emissions towards maBEETS.\n\n===========\nDiscord Discussion Channel\nhttps://discordapp.com/channels/885764705526882335/1127555925176229949",

      "title": "BIP-44: Swap DAO treasury auraBAL for vlAURA/veBAL",
      "content": "This proposal would grant the Music Directors the discretion to swap current and future auraBAL holdings for AURA and/or B-80BAL-20WETH, to be staked as vlAURA or veBAL respectively.\n\n===========\n**MOTIVATION**\n===========\nWIth the upcoming launch of Aura Finance and Balancer Boost on Optimism, Beethoven-X has an opportunity to lean into our Optimism deployment and the prospect of increased total value of AURA and BAL emissions for gauge enabled pools on the chain. One way through which we can do this is by directing emissions using our DAO Treasury veBAL and vlAURA holdings.\n\nIn November 2022, as a result of BIP-28, Beethoven-X DAO Treasury acquired equal valuations of veBAL, auraBAL, and vlAURA through market purchase (and staking) of each using treasury stablecoin funds. We have continued to build our vlAURA and veBAL positions with a share of protocol revenue, and each of these are used to collect bribes to compound back into the position or direct emissions to pools on Optimism.\n\nThe DAO Treasury currently holds ~2,021 auraBAL which are staked with Aura, as well as ~20.3 auraBAL as pending rewards from our vlAURA position. The staked auraBAL earns a variable APR but carries no gauge voting rights and so does not aid us in directing emissions.\n\nvlAURA and veBAL do carry voting power in their respective gauges, with each position able to earn from gauge bribes while directing emissions to pools of our choosing.\n\nBy exchanging the current auraBAL holdings (and future auraBAL earnings) in order to build our existing positions in vlAURA and/or veBAL, we would increase our vlAURA/veBAL gauge voting power with the aim of directing a greater value of total liquidity mining incentives to pools on Optimism. We expect this would help increase TVL and earnings from our Optimism deployment.\n\n===========\n**IMPACTS**\n===========\nThis proposal would alter the DAO Treasury asset allocation, reducing auraBAL exposure while increasing vlAURA and/or veBAL exposure. This change increases our ability to direct BAL/AURA emissions to pools on our Optimism co-deployment so is expected to aid in our goal of increasing TVL and revenue from the chain.\n\nThere is no anticipated negative impact for the team, contractors, treasury, tokenomics, Music Directors, the Guide Tones, or other committee recognised by the DAO.\n\n===========\n**RISK ASSESSMENT**\n===========\nRisks of this proposal include:\ni) Changing asset allocation of Treasury carries risk of greater or lesser total returns, however this risk is to be weighed against the abovementioned potential for attracting liquidity and hence revenue for the protocol.\nii) The change in asset allocation also alters Treasury exposure to smart contract risk, with reduced exposure to technical elements of auraBAL\niii) Both vlAURA & veBAL are locked positions and so this proposal increases illiquidity of a portion of Treasury assets that would otherwise be held as auraBAL\niv) There is no significant expected risk of greater centralisation risk, since auraBAL and vlAURA mechanics are both alterable by Aura Finance contributors.\n\n===========\n**SPECIFICATION**\n===========\nThis proposal would grant Music Directors the discretion to sell current and future Beethoven-X DAO Treasury holdings of auraBAL in order to increase DAO Treasury holdings of vlAURA and / or veBAL.\n\n===========\n**EXECUTION PLAN**\n===========\nFollowing successful vote, the Beethoven-X Music Directors would sell current DAO Treasury auraBAL, and use the proceeds to purchase AURA and then lock this as vlAURA on Aura Finance. The exact swap routing will be at Music Director discretion but will aim to maximise return from the transactions while accounting for gas costs.\n\nAny and all future earnings of auraBAL will be sold in order to increase veBAL and/or vlAURA holdings, with the timing to be at discretion of Music Directors while maintaining an aim for maximal return from the transactions.\n\nThe DAO Treasury address on Ethereum Mainnet is 0xea06e1b4259730724885a39ce3ca670efb020e26, all sales of auraBAL would be from this address and result in increased holdings of veBAL or vlAURA for this address.\n\n===========\nDiscord Discussion Channel\n===========\nhttps://discord.com/channels/885764705526882335/1121360266010050641",

      "title": "Emergency Proposal to Break POL BPTs and Bridge Off Fantom.",
      "content": "Introduction:\n\nThis emergency proposal is subject to the emergency vote procedure outlined in the governance framework (BIP-29, which is summarized here: https://docs.beets.fi/dao/framework#emergency-vote-procedure). \n\nThis proposal seeks to have the Beethoven-X Fantom multisig (0xa1e849b1d6c2fd31c63eef7822e9e0632411ada7) break the DAO’s significant BPT liquidity positions in the below pools in the total amount of approximately $1,119,000, and then bridge the Multichain exposed tokens to a chain or chains where they are native. wBTC will be bridged to Mainnet.\n\nThe relevant Multichain exposed assets are DAI, USDC, fUSDT, WBTC, and WETH.\nThe BPTs the proposal would break and bridge are [with pool contracts specified]:\n\n1  -    ‘A Late Quartet’ [0xf3A602d30dcB723A74a0198313a7551FEacA7DAc] – total pool TVL as of drafting of approximately $5,703,186\n\n2  -    ‘Steady Beets, Act II’ [0xeCAa1cBd28459d34B766F9195413Cb20122Fb942] – total pool TVL as of drafting of approximately $360,874\n\n 3  - ‘Steady Beets, Act IV’ [0xF47f4D59C863c02cBFA3EeFE6771b9C9fbe7B978] – total pool TVL as of drafting of approximately $690,419\n\n 4  -  ‘Fantom of the Opera, Act II’ [0x56ad84b777ff732de69e85813daee1393a9ffe10] – total pool TVL as of drafting of approximately $810,000\n\nNB: The ‘A Late Quartet’ BPT referenced in #1 to be broken and bridged include those held directly on Beethoven-X as well as the funds farming on Liquid Driver’s Shadow Farm.\n\nThe DAO Treasury’s current holdings on Fantom can be viewed at https://debank.com/profile/0xa1e849b1d6c2fd31c63eef7822e9e0632411ada7 \nNB: #3 ‘Steady Beets, Act IV’ and #4 ‘Fantom of the Opera, Act II’ are not displayed on Debank. \n\nThe POL BPT amounts in pools 1 - 4 are:\n1 – A Late Quartet (USDC, FTM, BTC, ETH) – approximately $654,924\n2 – Steady Beets Act II (USDC, DAI) – approximately $288,384\n3 – Steady Beats, Act IV (fUSDT, DAI, USDC) – approximately $50,130\n4 – Fantom of the Opera, Act II (wFTM, USDC) – approximately $126,000\n\nMotivation:\n\nThe above listed non-native tokens on Fantom are backed by the Multichain bridge. Multiple Multichain bridges/routers have been frozen over the last week with limited communication on their plan for reinstatement and significant ongoing uncertainty about risk to other Multichain bridges. \n\nMultichain has recently stated that they are unable to provide the necessary maintenance due to inability to contact their necessary personnel, and so they have suspended the affected bridges/routers that require maintenance. Various non-Multichain bridges, such as Stargate and Bungee, have also limited the ability to bridge the affected tokens from Fantom.\n\nThere is a risk that Multichain’s Fantom bridges will be affected by similar issues, leading to their suspension and the inability to realise the backing of bridged tokens. There is also a risk that such a suspension would be permanent or have a prolonged timeline which may impact the functioning of the Beethoven-X DAO.\n\n Risk assessment:\n\nThe goal is to move DAO Treasury assets to a chain or chains where they are native, or in cases where native bridging is not feasible due to token bridging or asset availability, subject to more favorable backing conditions than with Multichain. This should ameliorate the above-referenced risks and help to ensure that the DAO is able to operate and provide POL now and into the future. wBTC will be bridged to Mainnet.\n\nThis proposal, if adopted, will also have the direct and potential indirect impacts on protocol and pool TVL explained in the Impacts section.\n\nImpacts:\n\nThe purpose of this proposal is to seek to preserve treasury assets to ensure the DAO is able to continue to operate now and into the future.\n\nIf this proposal is adopted and implemented, it will directly reduce the protocol’s TVL on Fantom by approximately $1,119,000, or 4.6%. It will also reduce the TVLs for each of the 4 pools, which could increase slippage for trading the affected assets. This proposal is also likely to cause further reductions in the protocol’s Fantom TVL.\n\nFor BPT 1 (A Late Quartet), pool TVL of $5,703,186 will reduce by approximately $655,000.\n\nFor BPT 2 (Steady Beets, Act II), pool TVL of $360,874 will reduce by approximately $288,000.\n\nFor BPT 3 (Steady Beets, Act IV), pool TVL of $690,419 will reduce by approximately $50,000.\n\nFor BPT 4 (Fantom of the Opera, Act II), pool TVL of $810,073 will reduce by approximately $126,000.\n\n Specification:\n\nThe Treasury multisig will withdraw the BPTs for pools 1 – 4 above into individual tokens and cause the 5 Multichain-affected tokens to be bridged in batches to a chain or chains where they are native, or in cases where native bridging is not feasible due to token bridging or asset availability, subject to more favorable backing conditions than with Multichain. wBTC will be bridged to Mainnet. \n\nThe transactions will be shared with the community in the onchain-data-transactions channel and the tokens will remain in the bridged chain or chains as treasury assets, which will continue to be used to fund ongoing BIP obligations and DAO operations, until there is a further governance vote approving their return to Fantom or to put them to some other use.\n\nExecution plan:\n\nIdentical to specification.\n\nIf you would like to review the discussion that took place before this Snapshot was created, please visit the Beethoven-X discord.\nhttps://discord.com/channels/885764705526882335/1113822606542508063",

      "title": "BIP-42: Increase protocol fee on yield capture of IB (interest bearing) tokens on Fantom",
      "content": "## Intro\n\nThis proposal does not include any changes to protocol fee distribution, which is currently set:\n70% to treasury allocation\n30% to gauge incentive bounties\n\nThis is a ranked choice voting proposal. Read more on this type of proposal in the Snapshot documentation:\n[Ranked Choice Voting Documentation](https://docs.snapshot.org/user-guides/proposals/voting-types#ranked-choice-voting-instant-runoff-voting)\n\n## Motivation\n\nOn any IB token deposited into a Liquidity Pool on the DEX, Beethoven X takes a fee on the yield generated. We have called pools that include IB tokens Boosted pools. Boosted pools provide a sustainable source of protocol revenue that is purely a function of TVL and thus the protocol is no longer dependent on swap volume to ensure longevity. \n\nOne of the most important metrics when considering longevity of a protocol is comparing the amount of emissions the protocol is using to incentivize their users (BEETS rewards) to the revenue the protocol receives from its services (swap fees and yield capture from IB tokens). BeethovenX has continuously been trying to progress towards a revenue positive model and IB fees are a unique method to BeethovenX (and Balancer) to do so. We believe BeethovenX should take the next step towards a revenue positive model by increasing the protocol fee on yield capture of IB tokens on Fantom.\n\nBased on the discussion, we would propose four different options for a ranked choice voting type governance vote on Snapshot:\n\n- **Option 1:** Increase protocol fee on yield capture of IB tokens on Fantom for uncapped gauge vote pools from current 25% to 50%. Others pools are not altered.\n- **Option 2:** Increase protocol fee on yield capture of IB tokens on Fantom for all gauge vote pools from current 25% to 50%. Non-gauge-vote pools are not altered.\n- **Option 3:** Increase protocol fee on yield capture of IB tokens on Fantom for all pools to 35%.\n- **Option 4:** Reject proposal and keep things in the current state.\n\n## Impacts\n\nWe would like to bring out the following aspects:\n1) BeethovenX incentivizes gauge vote pools that have a >2% contribution to total protocol fees with extra bounties. Increasing protocol fee on IB yield capture would increase contribution % of boosted pools in comparison to non-boosted pools and would possibly make it easier for them to reach uncapped status.\n2) It would increase the amount of capital used to purchase BEETS from the market to be used as gauge vote bounties.\n3) Increased protocol fees translates to more aggressive treasury and POL growth, which has been an important focus for BeethovenX.\n4) Protocol fee on IB tokens is currently set to 50% on Optimism, where IB yield capture has shown to be a considerable part of total protocol fees.\n\nThere is no anticipated negative impact for the team, contractors, treasury, tokenomics, Music Directors, the Guide Tones, or other committee recognized by the DAO.\n\n## Risk Assessment\n\nDepends on the chose option. In any case LPs would earn less through IB yield capture, but it is possible the total rewards for liquidity providers could increase through increased BEETS incentives and/or indirect positive impacts on the protocol and BEETS valuation. \n\n## Specification\n\nProtocol fee adjustments would be done during the first gauge vote based emissions change following the vote. \n\n## Execution Plan\n\nFollowing successful vote, pools would have their protocol fee on yield capture of IB tokens adjusted based on the chosen option ~at the same time gauge vote based emission adjustments go live. Any adjustments required in the future (again, based on the chosen option) would also take place ~at the same time the gauge-vote based pool emissions adjustments go live.\n\n## Discord Discussion Channel\nhttps://discord.com/channels/885764705526882335/1105959409529671801\n",

      "content": "BeethovenX community member `decentralix` has apply to be a Guide Tone. Below is their application and a description of the purpose of Guide Tones.\n\n## Application:\nName: decentralix (or simply Felix)\nDiscord Name: decentralix#9196\nConfirmation: I have read and understood the scope and the powers of the Guide Tones.\nhttps://docs.beets.fi/dao/guide-tones\n\nGood morning / afternoon / evening Ludwigs,\nI am pleased to announce my application to be a Guide Tone. Beethoven X has first sparked my attention back in November 2021 after discovering the Fantom ecosystem a few months earlier. From the beginning, I understood that Beethoven X was somehow different –the first impression I got from the design of the interface was only the beginning. I’ve come to appreciate the sophistication of the underlying BalancerV2 technology, though I am only at the beginning of fully understanding it. I have high confidence in the Beethoven team members to continue executing on the promise of building the future of decentralized finance and want to contribute my part to the project as well.\n\nWhy I am applying to be a Guide Tone:\nThough granted, I probably haven’t been the most active community member on the Discord server (more lurking and listening instead of actively posting), this role would provide me with an opportunity to deepen my involvement in the community. At the same time, it relates to a topic which is essential for a successful evolution of Beethoven X – governance and community involvement in general is fundamental for any DeFi project. As a Guide Tone, I want to facilitate the discussion of new proposals and ensure that every voice in the community is heard. I would like to truly make an impact for community members with new ideas and inputs.\nHere are also a few things about my background:\nI am currently a computer science student at University of Zurich with a professional background in traditional finance. Crypto sparked my attention almost ten years ago – I started mining Bitcoin back when I was 14 years old and continued my adventure in crypto since then until today. DeFi has since become my passion, and this is the area I want to work in looking forward. The idea of a permissionless financial system built without intermediaries fascinates me tremendously.\n\nLastly, I am a member of the Ludwig Lounge since I bought my first Early Ludwig back in January 2022. I’ve also been lucky to win Ludwig NFTs in the town hall raffles.\n\nOf course, I am more than happy to answer any questions or points that I missed in the above – both in English and German!\n\nWith love, \ndecentralix\n\nhttps://discord.com/channels/885764705526882335/1102235221526593628/1102250445394686035\n\n",

      "title": "BIP-41 Extend treasury funding for Infrastructure cost",
      "content": "# Intro\nSince July 2022 the treasury has covered the infrastructure costs for the operation of beets.fi (BIP-23 and BIP-36) The overarching requirements have been:\n+ Infrastructure cost claims are capped at $10k per month.\n+ Contributors strive towards reducing the average cost.\nThis proposal is to continue the funding of infrastructure costs by the DAO Treasury while lowering the cap to $7500 per month.\n\n##  Motivation\nThe current extension ended at the end of March 2023 at month end. With this proposal we seek to extend this arrangement for another 6 months until the end of September 2023 with a significantly lowered monthly cap due to the following reasons:\n+ Infrastructure costs have stabilized and have been significantly lowered.\n+ Due to the close cooperation with Balancer and shared infrastructure services currently in the pipeline, the monthly costs of infrastructure for the Beethoven DAO is expected to drop up to 50% in the near future.\n\nBelow is a visual representation of the monthly infrastructure costs since May 2022.\n \n![InfraCost.JPG](ipfs://bafkreifnxmginvmpsfxyajselqfx7dmpnjvxjvjkav4hnonm5evcymcmui)\n    \nSince May we can see that not only have costs reduced, but they have also stabilized in a range of $4500-$5500 k per month. The slight uptick in February is due to the deployment of the anti scam bot on discord. As a result, as part of the extension, the cap of $7.5k a month is suggested. Infrastructure costs today include but are not limited to:\n+ AWS which includes: Build pipelines, virtual machines and databases used for the backend, databases and storage for self-hosted RPC and graph-node, load balancers, s3 storage.\n+ Cloudflare and Stellate: Cloudflare offers us security services and Stellate is used as a caching layer for the backend graphql endpoint.\n+ Domains and website hosting for our frontend.\n+ NEW: The Discord Anti Scam bot which has proven to be very effective in dramatically reducing interruptive scammers on the server.\n\n## Risks\nThere is a risk that infrastructure costs can increase for different reasons i.e. user traffic increases. It is for this reason a monthly cap is applied.\n If there is a month where there is a valid overspend, a separate proposal (with support) will be raised to gain approval for the excess amount.\n\n## Impacts and Specification\n+ Treasury - Will continue to carry the monthly infrastructure cost\nImpact on previous BIPs - This proposal serves as an extension of BIP-36 that runs until the end of March 2023.\n+ Team - none.\n+ Other contractors or consultants - None.\n+ Tokenomics - None.\n+ Other committees recognised by the DAO - None.\n\n## Execution plan\nThe DAO treasury covers the infrastructure cost of Beethoven X up to a maximum of $7.5k per month, this would be for an extension of six months (starting with April) up to and including September 2023, totaling a potential maximum of $45k.\n",

      "title": "BIP 40 - Extend Core Contributor Funding from Treasury",
      "content": "## Intro and Motivation\nSince the adoption of BIP-35 in October 2022, the contributor runway has been augmented by $25k per month from Treasury. This funding has played a vital role in retaining and attracting key contributors to work on Beethoven X technology. In 2023, Treasury revenues have improved, leading to the months January and February (March) being cash flow positive for the Treasury despite the 25k outflows. This proposal now seeks to extend and slightly increase treasury funding for contributors to $35k per month from April to September.\n\nBIP-35 significantly extended the contributor runway during 2022's challenging times.  Throughout 2022, the contributors also diligently reduced costs, decreasing headcount from 12.5 to approx. 8.5 and implemented a 50% compensation cut across the board by July 2022. The treasury funding via BIP-35 enabled, in October of 2022, the increase of compensation  from 50% to 75% of pre-cut levels and this reduction has been maintained ever since.\n\nThe protocol's foundation lies in state-of-the-art technology and a caring, kind community that is decentralized, transparent, and censorship resistant. Additional runway from the treasury has allowed contributors to remain committed to this vision. Q4 2022 witnessed the return of boosted pools, frontend improvements, and Q1 2023 saw significant progress with the Reliquary rollout and a substantial amount of collaboration with Balancer DAO and Balancer Labs. Marketing and design activities have also improved in quality and quantity through the unBEETables initiative and dedication and daily attention to design, content, and detail concerning educational efforts in relation to Beethoven X and Balancer technology..\n\nSteps are also being taken to increase and diversify contributors’ revenue, funding, and compensation. In February, the contributors entered into a temporary three-month service provider agreement with Balancer Labs, generating $25k monthly revenue while further advancing Balancer and Beethoven X technology. Soon, Beethoven X will be making a proposal to Balancer DAO to serve as a service provider at the DAO level. If this proposal is approved by veBAL governance, then the service provider contract will see funds paid to the Beethoven X Treasury, followed by the transfer of funds earned through the service provider agreement to contributors. The aim is to achieve this collaboration with the Balancer DAO by the end of April 2023.\n\nQ1's positive market developments have resulted in net positive earnings to the treasury from protocol fees. Protocol fee to treasury has surpassed the $25k outlay for the team (and for infrastructure costs) for the entirety of 2023. \n\n| Month        | DAO Treasury Revenue from Protocols | Contributors & Team DAO Contribution | Infrastructure Costs Contribution | Net DAO Treasury Rev* from Protocol Fees |\n| -------------- | ----------- | --------- | --------- | ---------- |\n| Jan | 48’328 | 25’000 | 4873.55 |  18454.45 |\n|Feb|55’572|25’000|6221.74|24530.26|\n|Mar|47’896|25’000|TBA (approx. $6,000)|16896.00|\n\n\nTo provide further context, the Beethoven X Treasury as of April 6 held assets worth over $4,118,605 (6 April 2023, https://beethovenxio.medium.com/da-weekly-data-drop-1-c83c175ffdda), of which $2,518,536 are not BEETS or OP tokens. \n\nThis proposal, if adopted, will help to extend runway to 12+ months once again and continue to retain and attract contributors who are able to further develop and refine Beethoven X and Balancer technology while simultaneously educating the public about its benefits and promoting its use. Together with the Balancer DAO service provider arrangement (if adopted), these measures will reinforce a more transparent, decentralized, and censorship resistant revenue and contributor compensation arrangement and will allow the team to raise compensation above 75%.\n\nFor these reasons, this proposal seeks to increase funding to $35k per month for the next six months. \n\nThank you for your consideration.\n\nImpact for the 6 months:\n\nTeam – Step 1: Contributors will receive an aggregate fixed $35k per month ($210k in total) in USDC from the Treasury. In addition, Step 2, assuming the Beethoven X-Balancer DAO service provider agreement is adopted: Revenue from the service provider agreement with Balancer paid into Treasury will also be used to fund the core contributor wallet.\n\nTreasury – Treasury assumes a fixed monthly cost of $35k per month ($210k in total) in USDC. Assuming the Balancer DAO service provider agreement is adopted, Treasury will also receive funds from the service provider agreement with Balancer and then distribute those to the core contributor wallet upon request.\n\nTokenomics – No impact\n\nCommittees – No impact\n\n## Specification:\nEach month, $35k USDC from Treasury and, upon request, any USDC received by Treasury for the anticipated service provider agreement with Balancer DAO  will be sent to the wallet: 0x0EDfcc1b8D082Cd46d13Db694b849D7d8151C6D5. No additional work or modification to status quo operations is required.\n\n## Execution Plan:\nUpon approval, the Treasury will send $35k in USDC to the team wallet monthly over six months. Treasury will periodically transfer funds from the anticipated Balancer DAO service provider agreement to  the same wallet. These authorizations will take effect from April month-end, though the Balancer DAO payment authorizations are contingent upon the Beethoven X service provider agreement being approved by veBAL governance.\n",

      "title": "BIP 39 - BeethovenX DAO Non-Profit Member-Managed LLC - Operating Agreement Proposal",
      "content": "This proposal follows the DAO’s adoption of BIP-37:A Non-Profit Limited Liability Company for the BeethovenX DAO. I am now seeking the DAO’s approval to adopt this operating agreement, which will serve as the governing framework for the BeethovenX DAO non-profit limited liability company that we are in the process of forming under the laws of the Republic of the Marshall Islands (“RMI”). This operating agreement and the DAO’s adoption of it are required steps to form the LLC under the laws of the RMI.\n\nAn operating agreement is a governing document that provides for how the member-managed non-profit LLC functions, sets out the rules for how the community will govern and operate it,  the purposes of the LLC, its governance mechanisms, how it and its rules will be amended and modified in the future, and the LLC’s administrative functions and requirements.\n\nThe LLC will be managed by the Token Holders, meaning it will be an arm of the BeethovenX DAO but will have no direct governance over the BeethovenX DAO or its treasury assets without a Governance Resolution adopted by the Token Holders (“Token Holder” is a defined term in the operating agreement).\n\nI full version of the Operating Agreements can be found here:\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1to7eQVd8gsuH4kAT8zlZEoQXv2DSAqU_cxIM-WXL5ww/edit\n\n\n**Motivation**\nAny LLC requires rules to operate. An operating agreement sets forth those rules. I am proposing that the BeethovenX DAO adopt the above-linked operating agreement as a required next step to move forward with the formation of the BeethovenX DAO non-profit LLC under the laws of the RMI. \n\nThe draft operating agreement, in its definitions section, sets forth a number of defined terms that are applicable to how the BeethovenX DAO LLC will function as a non-profit managed by the Token Holders.\n\nArticle I involves the organization of the LLC and pertains largely to administrative matters, such as its name, registered agent and office, principal office, additional documents that may be required, and its perpetual term.\n\nArticle II sets forth the LLC’s non-profit purposes and powers, which are consistent with everything discussed as part of the proposal and governance process for BIP-37.\n\n\nArticle III pertains to the Members, which are identified as the Token Holders (who must hold a “Token,” which is defined as Reliquary NFTs), incorporates the governance resolutions already adopted by the DAO and which remain effective, including the governance framework and prior BIPs that passed and are still effective (called “Governance Resolutions”), and provides that the Reliquary smart contract (called the “Smart Contract”) will be incorporated through BeethovenX’s Reliquary weighted Snapshot strategy (the “Voting Mechanism”) as  the method for voting on and adopting Proposals (“Proposals” is also a defined term). A Token Holder’s votes, available through the Voting Mechanism, are calculated by the Reliquary smart contract’s weighting and maturity method.\n\nArticle IV pertains to a Member’s rights and duties and similarly incorporates the quorum threshold that was previously adopted along with the balance of the governance framework and other Governance Resolutions that remain in effect at present. \n\nArticle V pertains to the management of the LLC through its authorized representatives (which include, amongst others, Music Directors, Guide Tones, and core contributors). \n\nArticle VI pertains to accounting and the maintenance of certain records through the Reliquary Smart Contract, Snapshot (the Voting Mechanism), hard copy documents, and certain other records as specified.\n\nArticle VII provides that members do not need to make capital contributions, which is true. To become a member, one becomes a Token Holder, which will involve acquiring a Reliquary NFT from another address or holder, minting it from the UI, or interacting directly with the smart contract. \n\nArticle VIII pertains to transfers of membership interests by Token Holders and the admission of additional members as explained above. Any address with a Reliquary NFT will be considered a member because the address is a Token Holder. Once an address no longer has a Reliquary NFT (because it was transferred, burned, etc.), the person, organization, or entity controlling the address will no longer be a member.\n\nArticle IX pertains to the dissolution of the LLC in the manner consistent with the RMI Non-Profit Act.\n\nArticle X pertains to how to amend the LLC operating agreement, which will be by a simple majority vote once a quorum has been established, unless a higher threshold vote applies and, in that case, the higher threshold will govern.\n\nArticle XI pertains to miscellaneous matters, including the LLC’s indemnification of authorized representatives and the resolution of disputes by arbitration or otherwise under the UK Jurisdiction Taskforce’s (“UKJT”) unique dispute resolution rules, published in April of 2021, for digital asset disputes and blockchain issues. The UKJT’s Rules are available here. The adoption of these rules for resolving disputes is particularly helpful because otherwise it would be almost impossible to ascertain how or where intra-member and other related disputes would be resolved.The UKJT Rules are also developed for and uniquely suited for blockchain disputes -  the purpose of the Rules is to “facilitate the rapid and cost-effective resolution of . . . disputes, particularly those involving novel digital technology such as cryptoassets, cryptocurrency, smart contracts, distributed ledger technology, and fintech applications.”\n\n**Risks**\nThe risks are essentially the same as those that were set forth in the Proposal for BIP-37 and the issues discussed and evaluated by the community as part of the process leading to the approval of  that Governance Resolution.\n\n**Impacts** \nThere is no anticipated negative impact for the team, contractors, treasury, tokenomics, Music Directors, the Guide Tones, or other committee recognised by the DAO. After incorporation, our contributors and Ludwigs will enjoy the benefits of limited liability established by the laws of the Marshall Islands. It will be possible for any contributor providing services to the DAO to receive compensation from the DAO LLC, subject of course to DAO governance, RMI law, and the operating agreement.\n\nBy rolling out the formation of the non-profit LLC and the adoption of the operating agreement in conjunction with Reliquary, the community is streamlining this process as much as reasonably possible. And the operating agreement was drafted in a manner through which it should enable the LLC to operate in the same manner that the DAO has historically operated and consistent with its Governance Resolutions that are in effect today.\n\nMatt | Alfalfa or Spanky? will receive $5,000 USDC and $5,000 of Beets, calculated at its three-month average price from the date this proposal may pass, from the Fantom treasury for his governance consulting efforts in assisting with this formation and governance process, and for assisting with the preparation of the operating agreement and assisting in completing the formation of the BeethovenX non-profit LLC. Matt’s services have been provided not as an attorney to the DAO or to anyone else, there is no attorney-client relationship. Rather, Matt has acted merely as a contributor to the BeethovenX DAO providing governance consulting services. Matt is not anyone’s lawyer here.\n\nThe balance of the funding for this Proposal was already approved by BIP-37.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThis is the next logical and required step to implement BIP-37 and Reliquary.\n\n**Specification**\nSubmit the operating agreement to MIDAO for submission to the RMI Registrar and proceed with any remaining items required to form the BeethovenX DAO non-profit LLC under RMI law.\n\nImplement Reliquary to the Smart Contract as identified in the operating agreement and implement the Snapshot weighted strategy identified as the Voting Mechanism in the operating agreement.\n\nInclude the following acknowledgement when minting a Reliquary NFT from the UI and include an upgradeable description in the NFT smart contract that incorporates and points to a current version of the operating agreement and Governance Resolutions.\n\nBeethovenX DAO Reliquary NFT Terms\nProtocol & Entity Participation. \nUnless otherwise indicated, the defined and capitalized terms used below incorporate the same meaning as the terms used in the BeethovenX DAO LLC operating agreement (the “Agreement”), available here:______________________. The NFT is referred to as the “Token” in the Agreement.\nBy using this NFT to participate in the governance and operations of the BeethovenX, the holder of this NFT agrees to be subject to the terms of the Agreement, including as a Member of its entity structure. BeethovenX formed a nonprofit LLC under the laws of the Republic of the Marshall Islands on ____________. Participation in the governance and operations of BeethovenX includes, but is not limited to, utilizing the NFT to: (1) vote on Proposals to become Governance Resolutions, (2) attend events and otherwise communicate with the BeethovenX community, and (3) interact with the BeethovenX protocol. \nExcept as otherwise provided in the Agreement, a Token Holder’s membership interest or rights thereunder in relation to this NFT are freely transferable to another person through its conveyance. Except as otherwise provided in the Agreement, a Member shall be deemed to have resigned from the BeethovenX DAO LLC upon the disposal or transfer of this NFT.\n\nAuthorize the treasury to send $5,000 USDC and $5,000 of Beets, calculated at its three-month average price from the date this proposal may pass, to Matt | Alfalfa or Spanky?\n\n**Execution Plan** \nIdentical to the Specification.\n\n",

      "title": "BIP 38 - Funding of Reliquary implementation",
      "content": "**Intro**\n\nHey everyone\n\nThis proposal is to determine part of the implementation of the new fBEETs reliquary farm.\nThere are two options to consider:\n1. fBEETs holders will go through a period of 8 days where no farm emissions are earned.\n2. fBEETs holders that have migrated to the new farm will immediately get emissions, these emissions will be provided by the treasury. Estimated to be between 250k-300k if BEETs. \n\n**Motivation**\n\nAs a recap, the reliquary maturity model will soon be replacing the current fBEETs model. The Reliquary design ensures that over a period of time, both your farming and governance power grow as your relic matures. In Reliquary, the staked fBeets remain liquid therefore you can remove your stake at any time or sell your relic on the secondary market.\n\nThe implementation of the new model will see a change in how fBEETs earns its farm rewards.\nCurrently, the Beethoven X: Masterchef mints BEETs on a per block basis and this is allocated to various farms. Example diagram below:\n\n \n![model 1.png](ipfs://bafkreidq7lexy7lefhiibjacuka4teyjeazlp2vsp4y6ycf4c4wsskg3iu)\n    \n\nOnce we have transitioned to the new model there will be a subtle change in this flow.\nThe Beethoven X: Masterchef will always be the only contract able to mint BEETs, this will not change. BEETs that are scheduled to go to the fBEETs farm will go to the Reliquary instead  via an automated process. \n\nUsers will no longer receive fBEETs rewards through the Masterchef but through Reliquary. Here is an example diagram representing what the change looks like:\n\n \n![model 2.png](ipfs://bafkreihwihhlpt7a6phvfwc3ezs4llatgwhp3xl7x5pxsvplgwfe3p62hm)\n    \n\nThis change brings about a challenge around the initial implementation of the new model.\n\n*The “Reliquary” farm will need 8 days worth of BEETs in order to allow for a smooth and continuous flow post implementation. 8 days worth of BEETS allows for a regular harvest/transfer interval of one week and leaves 1 day of surplus emissions just in case.*\n\nThe question is how to best go about it, this proposal looks to get approval of one of the following:  \n\n**Option 1 -** \t\nTurn off the fBEETs farm rewards for a period of 8 days and allow the new farm to fill up. While it is temporary, this will mean that for those 8 days there will be no farm APR on any of the fBEETs farms.\nThis period of no rewards will coincide with the migration to the new fBEETS farm and relics, so it can be seen as a call to action. During this period, users can migrate the staked fBeets in Masterchef to the Reliquary. It is important to note, that while rewards are off, your relic will still mature and when they are turned on again your rewards will be representative of your relic level\n\nUsing a timeline, this will look like:\n1. fBeets will get reward until day (t) \n2. fBeets Reliquary will get rewards after 8 days have passed (t+9 days)\n\n \n \n![timeline 1.png](ipfs://bafkreighrwezcwreitfrehbd36zx7cmx2kld5mtfbbgqws4novf2a3txiq)\n    \n    \n\n**Option 2 - **\nUse Treasury to frontload the Reliquary. \nThis will allow farm rewards to continuously flow but the Treasury will only be able to recover the BEETs once we have come to the end of our emissions.\nIt is estimated that it will require between 250k-300k BEETs for this purpose. For reference, at the time of writing, the Treasury holds over 13.5m BEETS so it represents just over 2% of the balance held.\n\nUsing a timeline, this will look like:\n1. fBeets will get reward until day (t) \n2. fBeets Reliquary will get rewards immediately after 1 has happened (right after)\n\n \n![timeline 2.png](ipfs://bafkreifecedhg7c6yx6udgomsu657km2xgqhoku6tuz3d7w4zqsahuna5i)\n    \n\nIt is important to note, that there will be a firm cut-off time where the Masterchef emissions will end and in both instances the current fBEETs farm will stop earning rewards when minting relics goes live.\n\n**Risks** \nThe main risk identified:\n\nOption 1 -  with no emissions on the new farms, users may not migrate but rather exit their position. \n\nOption 2 - Treasury will only be able to recover the BEETs used once the masterchef has stopped emitting BEETs, this is just under 3 years away.\n\n**Impacts** \nOption 1 - Nothing.\nOption 2 - Except for the Treasury ask, there are no other impacts.\n\n**Specification** \n\nOption 1 - Nothing.\nOption 2 - Treasury is to send BEETs to the fBEETs Reliquary farm. (Contract address still to be determined).\n\n**Execution Plan** \n\nOption 1 - Nothing.\nOption 2 - Once the fBEETs Reliquary farm is available, the Treasury will send the required BEETs to fill the farm .\n\n\n\n\n",

      "title": "BIP - 36: Infrastructure Costs",
      "content": "*Intro*\n\nHi all\n\nIn July there was a governance vote that passed authorizing the treasury to cover infrastructure costs. The overarching requirement was:\n - Cost claims would be capped at $10k per month\n - Work towards reducing the average cost\n - Run it for a trial period, with it ending at October month end\n\nThis proposal is to continue with the process\n\n*Motivation*\nWe are now approaching the end of this period and would like the community to approve an extension up to the end of March 2023 Month End.\n\nIncluded is a visual representation of the monthly infrastructure costs since the start of the year.\n\n![infra.png](ipfs://bafkreihjpi2n3mcy3qphzo76p2jbnk7bp4fkl524qzae4l2mmji6rlkuny)\n\n\nSince May we can see that not only have costs reduced, but they have also stabilized at around $5k per month. As a result, as part of the extension, keep the cap at $10k a month.\n\nInfrastructure costs include but are not limited to:\n - AWS which includes: Build pipelines, virtual machines and databases used for the backend, databases and storage for self-hosted RPC and graph-node, load balancers, s3 storage.\n - Cloudflare and Stellate: Cloudflare offers us security services and Stellate is used as a caching layer for the backend graphql endpoint.\n - Domains and website hosting for our frontend\n\n*Risks*\nThere is a risk that infrastructure costs can become quite substantial. It is for this reason a monthly cap is applied. \nIf there is a month where there is a valid overspend, a separate proposal (with support) will be raised to gain approval for the excess amount.\n\n*Impacts and Specification*\n\nTreasury - Will continue to carry the monthly infrastructure cost\nImpact on previous BIPs - This proposal serves as an extension of BIP 23 that runs until the end of October https://snapshot.org/#/beets.eth/proposal/0x8759f2f5a2eef55a4438c1bc2566651cba0fda5684dcbd371dfe94aa17828b39\n\nTeam - none\nOther contractors or consultants - None\nTokenomics - None\nOther committees recognised by the DAO - None\n\n*Execution plan*\n The DAO treasury covers the infrastructure cost of Beethoven X up to a maximum of $10k per month, this would be for an extension of five months (starting with November) up to and including March 2023, totaling a maximum of $50k.\n \n\n    ",

      "title": "Team Funding",
      "content": "**Intro**\n\nEarlier this month there was a discussion in the #governance channel around the team’s reduction in headcount and current salary structure of 50%. This proposal is to request a monthly ask of $25k per month for six months ($150k total) from the Treasury to support team salary payments and in return the team will sacrifice the 20% it gets from protocol fees.\n\n**Motivation**\nOver the months, the team has been open on questions regarding runway. We have tried to be diligent and looked to save on costs where we can.\n\nOur belief has always been that the protocol is based firmly on a foundation of state of the art technology.  If we are successful in establishing a market fit for our product, we will reap the benefits.\n\nSteps we have taken to extend the current runway is that we have reduced  the team headcount from 12.5 (start of the year) to 8.5. The team had started taking reduced pay as early as April and since July everyone has been on a 50% salary: this move extended our runway to 12 months as we work on core product features.\n\nWe have put our heads down and kept working, in Q3 alone we did a revamp of a significant part of the website and released new pools that will help the longevity of Beethoven as a protocol. Key product features we are very proud of.\n\nThe unfortunate reality is that the 50% pay base is starting to have an impact on some team members. At this pay rate we may soon run the risk of losing operationally critical team members in the next few months. Not from lack of desire to be here, but out of financial necessity.\n\nIt is with this that we would like to ask the Treasury to support some of the costs, in the form of $25k per month in USDC. This would allow us to bring team members to a 75% salary without impacting the base runway of the team.\nAt 75%, the at-risk team members would have enough of a salary to sustain themselves personally and continue to contribute to Beethoven full time.\n\nThis would be for a period of 6 months (total cost would be $150k). \nWe also do not wish for this to be a blanket ask so in return we will sacrifice our 20% share of the monthly protocol fee. This will go to the Treasury instead.\n\n**Impact for the 6 months**\n\nTeam – The team will no longer take its portion of protocol fees, currently 20%. In return the team will get a fixed $25k per month ($150k in total), in USDC\n\nTreasury – The Treasury monthly allocation from protocol fees will increase to 70% (currently at 50%). It will also take on a fixed monthly cost of $25k per month ($150k in total), in USDC\n\nTokenomics – No impact\n\nCommittees – No Impact\n\n**Specification**\n\nEach month $25k USDC is to be sent to the Team wallet: 0x0EDfcc1b8D082Cd46d13Db694b849D7d8151C6D5\n\nNo other additional work is required, the 20% will be sent to the Treasury as part of the other protocol fees sent for the month.\n\n**Execution Plan**\n\nIf accepted, the treasury will start sending the team wallet $25k in USDC monthly over six months and will take 70% of the protocol fees. These changes will be effective from October month end.\n",

      "title": "cLQDR bid proposal",
      "content": "Intro\nThis proposal is for fBEETs holder to determine if BeethovenX should put forward a proposal to take over the management of cLQDR. It will talk through the management requirements and the benefits it brings to the protocol together with the potential downsides. cLQDR holders will vote on who will take over the management of it and this proposal seeks approval to submit a bid\n\nThis proposal looks at cLQDR only, it does not look to request the management of MOR. \n\nMotivation \nGrowth Defi has announced that it is leaving the Fantom network. This decision leaves a number of cLQDR holders in the lurch as there is no longer a team around to manage the product.\n\nSo what is cLQDR, how could we potentially help and what would the benefit be to us\n\n What is cLQDR\n\ncLQDR is a wrapped token derivative built on top of xLQDR and has the following functions:\nAllow users to sell their locked xLQDR position on a secondary market\nCompounds all the rewards (cLQDR goes up vs LQDR overtime) \nAs a cLQDR holder you profit from both the rewards, the bribes that xLQDR holders receive and the performance fees collected through strategies\nCreates constant buy pressure for LQDR and perpetually locks the supply it controls\nHow could we potentially help\n\nThe main aim would be to allow cLQDR holders to continue to either trade or hold their cLQDR without fear that liquidity in the market will dry up.\nAt BeethovenX we already offer the best trading experience for cLQDR and the aim is to continue providing this experience while maintaining as many of the current cLQDR rewards as possible.\n\nCurrently cLQDR holders get:\n20% performance fee from MOR vault strategies (this will no longer continue)\nRewards from Liquid Driver Revenue sharing vaults \nRewards from bribes (both layer 1 and layer 2)\n\nAs part of this set up, a 12.5% management fee is applied to the gained cLQDR and allocated to veGRO holders\n\nWhat the BeethovenX would offer:\nDelegation of all layer 2 voting power to Liquid driver. This would be the voting power xLQDR holder in gauge systems of inspirit, veHND or any other equivalent. Bribe returns will be auto-compounded into cLQDR\nRewards from Liquid Driver Revenue sharing vaults will be auto-compounded into cLQDR\nRedeployment of Pirate in C using the latest pool factory technology, this would be an updated metastable pool that allows for protocol fee on the yield.\nUse up to 25% of the LQDR master gauge voting power to direct LQDR emissions to the new pool\nReduction of the 12.5% management fee previously, going forward this would be held at 7%\nThe redeployed Pirate in C pool will form part of the \"Core Pool\" model initially outlined in BIP 24. This means that protocol fees earned from that pool would be used as voting incentives for it to attract emissions.\n For as long at Beethoven has control of cLQDR, it will also get 0.33% of base emissions (currently valued at $7.5k) for each vote cycle\n\nHow it would benefit us\n \nThere is currently over 500k LQDR in the cLQDR contract. Taking over the management and maintenance of the cLQDR would give us the right of use to that LQDR.\nThrough that process we would be able to direct a significant amount of emissions in Liquid driver’s master gauge system, which could be used to incentivise pools across both Fantom and Optimism.\n\nIt would also introducee:\nAdditional revenue through the protocol fee taken on the cLQDR liquidity pool, \nManagement fee charged for maintenance and \nIt would see us bring a sizable balance onto the Treasury Balance sheet.\n\nRisks \n\nIf BeethovenX takes over cLQDR, it has the responsibility of maintaining the peg of cLQDR in the long run, and may potentially need to incentivize liquidity of cLQDR for the purpose. \n\nImpacts \n\nTeam - Would need to develop a UI for cLQDR holders as well as the maintenance of the process. \n\nTreasury - at the time of writing, it would be taking on a little over $600k worth of LQDR \n\nLiquidity Committee - Will need to determine which pools to allocate LQDR votes towards\n\nSpecification \n\nTeam would need to:\nCreate a UI for cLQDR holders and\nDeploy a revamped version of the Pirate in C pool\n\nExecution Plan \n\nIf the community votes yes, a proposal will be made to the cLQDR community to take over the management and maintenance of their contract\n",

      "title": "fBEETS x Reliquary",
      "content": "The voting options for the below are:\n**Vote Yes** for Reliquary implementation.\n**Vote No** for Reliquary and continue to evaluate ve Locking and alternative solutions.\n\n**Intro**\n\nThe locking of fBEETS has been a long-awaited event. DeFi is constantly evolving and we must ensure that the decisions we make as a protocol are not only current but oriented towards placing Beethoven X in the best place for a successful future. After in-depth consideration, analysis, and debate, this proposal puts forward a proposition to utilize the Reliquary model instead of the previously proposed vote escrowed (ve) tokenomics for fBEETS. \n\n**Motivation**\n\nIn April of this year, the community voted in favor of a proposal to introduce a locking mechanism for fBEETS. Due to a cascade of events that affected the wider market and the release of V2, the launch of Locking was postponed.\n\nSo much has changed since then and the question now arises: given the current climate does it still make sense for us to go ahead with this initiative?\n\nAs a recap, here are the key points relating to locking\n\nPros: \n\n - Users who lock are incentivized to participate in the democracy of the protocol\n - Users can earn a boost in rewards and participate in governance\n - Protocols give extra votes for longer time-locks\n - Align the protocol and holders incentives, those who lock hope to see the protocol succeed.\n - Incentivizes larger holders to lock up as they can gain more control of the protocol.\n - Capital is “stuck”\n\nCons:\n\n - Users who lock are forced to participate in the democracy of the protocol\n - Whales and DAOs can max lock a small portion of their tokens and control a majority of a protocol\n - Not an effective mechanism to align both protocol and user incentives\n - Traders who want to sell won't lock\n - Users want to hold liquid assets, locking removes any freedom a user has\n - Users who lock first benefit most and can sell on unlocks\n - Not an efficient mechanism to reduce price depreciation\n - Inefficient use of capital\n - ve protocols quickly turn into whales just owning them\n - The largest LPs are also the largest token holders\n - Impacts your ability to de-leverage\n - Capital is “stuck”\n\nAs we peel back some of the layers on a system that has had such a profound effect on the industry as a whole, it becomes ever more clear that there are still major drawbacks that make the ve locking mechanism a questionable choice for future implementation.\n\n**Introducing the Reliquary**\n\nThe reliquary is an evolution of the Masterchef contract that also offers an alternative solution to the shortcomings of the current vote escrowed model.\n\nThrough the use of financial NFTS, the reliquary offers users the freedom and flexibility to build sustainable positions over time that align users' incentives with the desired outcomes of the protocol in a more ethical manner. An unexplored evolution, the reliquary encourages the diversity of the community by redistributing dominance hierarchies, bringing power back into the hands of the people.\n\nThe Reliquary allows users to deposit LP positions within a Relic; unlike ve mechanisms a Relic can be exited at any time. There is no locking. Instead of users needing to lock a position to gain voting power and boosted emissions, the Reliquary incorporates a concept known as maturity.\n\nRather than “force” users into a locked position, maturation through Reliquary encourages users to align with the protocol whilst keeping the user's “freedom” intact. The Relic persuades users / DAOs to earn additional incentives/governance power by cultivating a position over a given time period. The longer a position is held the more potent it becomes.\n\n**How does it work?**\n\nMaturity will be broken down into various tiers or tranches with each tier progressively unlocking more rewards. Both emissions and voting power will scale up as users approach a higher level of maturity until the maximum level of maturity is obtained. Users will not obtain maximum emissions nor voting power at the creation of the Relic, they must obtain the different levels with time, trust and patience. \n\nThere are two key differences between this and the ve model. The first is that voting power is not dictated by how long you are willing to lock your tokens for, but instead how long you’ve been a participant in a protocol. Secondly, users are not forcibly locked and can exit their positions whenever they choose.\n\nDepositing more to your position will impact the degree of maturity (impact is weighted by the amount invested compared to your entire position). However, unique to the Reliquary, user positions are stored as NFTs rather than attached to addresses. This unlocks a whole range of creative possibilities; users may hold multiple, transferable positions, merge positions together or even engage in trade on secondary marketplaces.\n\nFor a more detailed exploration of the intricacies of how the Reliquary works, take a dive deeper into the technical here:\n\nhttps://medium.com/beethoven-x/reliquary-the-new-chef-in-town-249c3a8dbf1b\n\n**What are the advantages?**\n\nLet’s keep in mind why we are here, and that is to build a system that is future-oriented, efficient, and constantly evolving with the times. Reliquary is innovative and it could provide our platform with novel opportunities that have yet to be fully explored.\n\n Here are some of the key advantages of its implementation:\n\n - Reliquary shifts the focus of an incentive model from “forced” to encouraged.\n - It solves the issue of illiquidity as positions can be exited when desired.\n - It fosters a system for protocol alignment that is more reflective of the community we are trying to cultivate\n - It brings the power back to people, those who believe in the project’s success will wait for maturity.\n - It offers every user the ability to engage and participate in governance.\n - It opens up the potential for a secondary marketplace where mature positions can be traded.\n - It is innovative and seeks to evolve the current systems we have\n - It has scope for future development; if successful all of our emissions could be channeled through this model.\n - Potential to unlock a huge amount of inefficient capital currently sitting on farms\n\n**Risks**\n\nWhat are the risks of this proposal?\n\n - Reliquary is a new piece of technology that hasn’t been battle-tested, it has several audits, but smart contract risk is always a consideration.\n - The earlier users lock, the more power they obtain\n - Change requires adoption and education. Convincing users to shift paradigms takes time and effort\n - There is no guarantee this new model will be successful, there is always the risk of failure.\n\n**Impacts** \n\nImpact on the *core team*\n\nIf a proposal is passed, it would mean that Beethoven would no longer implement the current locking initiative. Instead, the development team would look to prepare our infrastructure for the adoption of the Reliquary. The team has already done extensive research into the underlying architecture and they are confident in its adoption. The specifics for its rollout still need to be determined and hinge on the collective decision from the community.\n\nImpact on *fBEETS tokenomics*\n\nAs the Reliquary integrates a new contract, it provides an opportunity for the fBEETS pool to be remade. The composition of the pool can stay the same but there is also the potential for it to be changed depending on community consensus. Following the creation of the pool, it would be a simple migration for users and only require a few clicks to enter and deposit the BPTs into a Relic. The whole process would be seamless, built straight into the Beethoven X UI. The migration allows not only for the evolution of infrastructure but an evolution of fBEETS.\n\nThe Reliquary Masterchef will also see fBEETs farm emissions move from a per block to a per-second basis. Having emissions released on a per-second basis is a step forward in future planning as it allows for forecasting without the uncertainty of block speeds.\n\nImpact on *governance*\n\nThe maturity curve dictates a Relics position, and Beethoven X has the freedom and flexibility to choose specific time frames and levels that most effectively encourage participation. Yield and voting power can even operate on separate curves.\n\nThe most significant difference here between Reliquary and the ve model is that your governance power naturally develops/ grows are your relic matures. Under the ve model your voting power is at its strongest and then enters a natural decay unless you are actively relocking\n\nLike with ve model, Reliquary unlocks the possibility for an on-chain governance system. Instead of relying on random snapshots to reduce the chance of users gaming the governance system, every user must engage in a period of maturity to gain voting power, limiting the ability for users to buy a position to vote and sell straight after.\n\n**Specification** \n\nThis initial proposal seeks to gain approval to adopt the Reliquary model for fBEETS. \n\nThe specifics surrounding fBEETS composition would require separate proposals to be voted on. \n\nThe length to full maturity as well as the maturity profile is still to be determined, the goal is to have full maturity achievable within 8-12 weeks.\n\nThe Reliquary is a new smart contract and would thus require time for technical implementation by the development team. The specific timeframe needed to integrate this contract and ensure the utmost safety and security has been stipulated in the execution section. \n\nThe migration of fBEETS into Reliquary is only a starting point. The implementation of fBEETS and Reliquary could open up a pathway where Beethoven X could integrate all pools with the contract, allowing users to deposit every BPT on the protocol within a Relic. This would require separate community consensus and proposals following a successful implementation of Reliquary and fBEETS.\n\n**Execution Plan** \n\nWith the approval of this proposal, the team would begin the implementation of the Reliquary, transitioning away from the current fBEETS model. As mentioned above, the team will strive to implement a migration path with as little friction as possible, with the goal to have a “zap” migration.\n\nThe current timeline for the development process is approx 4 - 8 weeks from the date of the proposal passing. During this time period, we will release an article to outline the precise steps for the migration into Reliquary. In order to allow for a “fair” transition, there will be a period of approximately 1 (or 2) week(s) where fBEETS emissions will be disabled to allow everyone enough time to migrate to the new system. This procedure would be the same if implementing a ve locking model. \n\nDuring this period of development, the community is welcome to put forward any proposals to change the composition of fBEETS. As this is an underlying change to the tokenomics of fBEETS, this would require community consensus and all proposals must follow the current procedure outlined by the governance framework. \n\nIf this proposal fails to pass, the team would then continue to evaluate the ve locking model and alternative solutions that are more aligned with the community, team goals and the overall health of the protocol.\n\nThe final decision on the direction we take will be decided by community consensus.\n\n**Vote Yes for Reliquary implementation.\nVote No for Reliquary and continue to evaluate ve Locking and alternative solutions.**\n",

      "title": "Acquisition of veBAL, auraBAL, and vlAURA",
      "content": "**Intro**\n \nThis proposal contains two initiatives to acquire veBAL, auraBAL, and vlAURA via a one-time purchase to kickstart the flywheel mechanism and a modification of the current Optimism protocol fee distribution in order to continue to increase exposure to these assets without further use of current treasury funds.\n\n**Background**\n \nAura Finance is a protocol built on top of the Balancer system that provides maximum incentives to Balancer liquidity providers and veBAL stakers through social aggregation of veBAL deposits. Read more here: https://docs.aura.finance/aura/what-is-aura. To learn more about veBAL, look here: https://docs.balancer.fi/ecosystem/vebal-and-gauges.\n \nRecent discussion amongst Beethoven Ludwigs (https://discord.com/channels/885764705526882335/1010923236877422672) has involved the pros and cons of directing treasury funds to allow for active participation in the recently initiated flywheel effect that has been eagerly awaited since the deployment of Beethoven on the Optimism network. The first bribing round via Hidden Hand on Optimism using BEETS, USDC, and OP tokens to direct BAL emissions towards the Rocket Fuel pool was a massive success, resulting in an increase of TVL from ~$40,000 to north of ~$2,330,000 as of time of this writing, a substantial increase in TVL considering a bribe amount of just ~$8,300 (50,000 BEETS, 2,500 USDC, and 2,100 OP). Given that an increase in TVL will generate increased fees, and that bribe amount is directly related to generated fees (50% of Beethoven’s fees on Optimism are used as bribes), bribe amounts are only expected to continue to increase, thus further increasing TVL, and so on (hence the “flywheel” effect).\n \nThanks to the recent passage of the “Restructure of Treasury Assets” proposal (https://snapshot.org/#/beets.eth/proposal/0x2de0c116162b820bed17351164f1806106a04eb19c9499648d5725fd75b36dbe), Beethoven now has over $250,000 worth of Protocol Owned Liquidity (POL) in the Rocket Fuel pool. As such, the protocol will be actively earning BAL token emissions. However, per the agreement with Balancer Labs, any farmed BAL tokens are restricted in use to holding or sending to the Ethereum network to be converted into veBAL. While this is certainly a good thing, accumulating a substantial veBAL position using these farmed BAL tokens to actively direct BAL token emissions to Beethoven pools will take time a significant amount of time.\n \nThe treasury currently has ~$930,000 worth of stable coins between ~$720,000 of USDC in the treasury wallet and ~$210,000 of stablecoins in POL in Fantom pools. Considering that $500,000 should be available for a potential bug bounty and ~$250,000 should be available as project runway, ~$180,000 is currently not being utilized in a capital efficient manner.\n \nAdditionally, the current protocol fee distribution on Optimism is the same as on Fantom: 50% to protocol owned liquidity, 30% to bribes on Fantom, 18% to team, and 2% to eco-fund. Half of the fees collected on Optimism are first directed towards bribes on Hidden Hand for Beethoven pools (currently only Rocket Fuel); after this the above allocation occurs. The 50% allocation towards POL from the Optimism network is currently “chain agnostic,” meaning that these funds can be used to accumulate POL in Beethoven pools on Fantom, Optimism, or both, at the discretion of the Liquidity Committee, though must be used to accumulate POL in Beethoven pools. However, the 50% allocation towards POL from the Optimism network could instead be used in isolation to further increase veBAL, auraBAL, and vlAURA positions on Ethereum to promote the flywheel effect without the need to further tap into treasury funds.\n\n**Motivation**\n \nThis proposal seeks to gain community approval to direct $75,000 worth of USDC tokens in the treasury wallet on the Fantom network towards the Ethereum network in order to obtain a position in the Balancer and Aura ecosystems in order to actively participate in the flywheel effect. One third of this amount would be allocated towards the purchase of veBAL. One third would be allocated towards auraBAL, which would then be staked to earn rewards. One third would be allocated to the purchase of AURA, which would be locked as vlAURA.\n \nAdditionally, the proposal seeks to reallocate the 50% of fees on Optimism that currently goes towards the accumulation of POL in Beethoven pools instead be bridged to the Ethereum network to be evenly split towards the purchase of veBAL, auraBAL, and vlAURA on a monthly basis. This would result in a silo effect of 50% of fees collected on Optimism (effectively preventing this allocation from reaching Fantom) and reduce the total amount of POL accumulated each month in Beethoven pools; however, the treasury would still be accumulating assets, albeit in Balancer and Aura on the Ethereum network. This aspect of the proposal will allow the protocol to “dollar cost average” into veBAL, auraBAL, and vlAURA on a monthly basis without the need to further tap into treasury funds. This would not have an impact on the 30% allocation on Optimism towards bribes on Fantom. In theory, the resulting flywheel would increase fees generated on Optimism, resulting in larger amounts of fees directed towards bribes on Fantom, directly benefitting fBEETS holders.\n\n**Impacts**\n \nThe proposal would have 3 main impacts.\n \nDiversify treasury funds via exposure to both Balancer and to Aura Finance, a project that directly benefits the Balancer (and by extension, the Beethoven) ecosystem. Several DAOs have recently acquired positions in Aura, have deposited liquidity into Aura, or are discussing doing so, including Gnosis DAO, Temple DAO, Badger DAO, Aave DAO, Olympus DAO, and Redacted Cartel.\n \nProvide the opportunity to passively farm AURA, BAL, and bb-a-USD tokens via staking veBAL and auraBAL, as well as auraBAL via locking AURA. In addition to the potential upside that AURA and BAL may have, this will allow for additional capital generation for the treasury.\n \nFinally, and most importantly, the initial purchase will allow the protocol to rapidly kickstart the flywheel mechanism that recently began with the initiation of Hidden Hand bribes on the Optimism network by using veBAL and vlAURA to direct BAL emissions towards Beethoven’s pools. The shift in allocation of POL accumulation away from being confined to Beethoven pools towards accumulating positions in the above projects on Ethereum will result in the continued expansion of treasury assets that will directly benefit Beethoven on both Optimism and Fantom.\n\n**Risk Assessment**\n \nThere are inherent smart contract risks.\n \nBAL and AURA are volatile tokens, and their price may fluctuate. This is a risky proposal insofar as that the treasury is reducing its stable reserves in favor of positions in volatile tokens. However, price fluctuations in these token values should be irrelevant to the main purpose of this proposal, which is to increase the BAL emissions towards Beethoven on Optimism in order to attract liquidity and increase generated fees. Additionally, given the bear market is in full swing, the long-term trajectories of both BAL and AURA may be bullish.\n \nHaving a position in vlAURA will expose the protocol to receiving its own bribes. However, the bribes received by the protocol can simply be added to the next round.\n \nveBAL and vlAURA positions could become diluted over time. However, using the 50% of Optimism fees that are currently being allocated to POL to instead further increase these positions, as well as reinvesting any farmed tokens on the Ethereum network, will minimize any dilution of the initial position gained via the one-time purchase.  \n \nAn initial aggressive strategy using 50% of generated fees on Optimism to accumulate positions in veBAL, auraBAL, and vlAURA will be beneficial in directing BAL emissions towards Beethoven on Optimism. However, as generated monthly fees increase, this allocation may need to be revisited and shifted once again towards accumulation of POL in Beethoven’s pools. As an example, an initial reduction to 30% towards accumulation of veBAL, auraBAL, and vlAURA to allow 20% to be used for POL could be a reasonable intermediary step in the future and would be up to the community.\n\n**Specifications/Execution Plan**\n \nIf approved, the following would take effect:\n \nThe Liquidity Committee would direct $75,000 USDC from the treasury wallet and 0.5 ETH (to be used for the sole purpose of gas fees) from the Fantom network to the Ethereum network.\n \nOne third would be converted to veBAL and locked for the maximum amount of time (1 year).\n \nOne third would be converted to auraBAL and staked.\n \nOne third would be converted to AURA and locked as vlAURA.\n \nThe veBAL and vlAURA would only be allowed to vote for Beethoven pool(s) during gauge votes.  Vote allocation will be decided by the Liquidity Committee.\n\nThe veBAL and vlAURA voting power may be used to vote on Balancer Improvement Proposals and Aura Improvement Proposals at the discretion of the liquidity committee for or against proposals in a manner that aligns with the best interests of Beethoven. \n \nOnce per month, rewards would be first harvested and then allocated as follows: harvested BAL would be reinvested as veBAL and lock time would be again extended to the maximum (1 year); harvested auraBAL would be staked; harvested AURA would be locked as vlAURA; harvested bb-a-USD would be swapped for ETH to ensure ongoing coverage for gas fees on the Ethereum network.  \n \nOnce per month, 50% of protocol fees collected on Optimism (after the 50% of fees has been removed for the purpose of Hidden Hand bribes) would be bridged from Optimism to the Ethereum network and evenly split to purchase veBAL with max time lock (16.66%), purchase of auraBAL which would be staked (16.66%), and purchase of AURA to be locked as vlAURA (16.66%). These can be combined with the above harvested rewards per the Liquidity Committee in the most efficient manner possible to reduce gas costs. The rest of the allocation would remain unchanged (30% towards bribes on Fantom, 18% towards team, 2% to eco-fund).\n \nOnce per month, any farmed BAL on Optimism by the protocol will be bridged to the Ethereum network and converted to veBAL along with the above harvested tokens. Again, this will be combined with the above to reduce gas costs to the extent possible.\n \nAny bribe rewards received by the protocol due to actively voting with vlAURA will be added to the next bribing round.\n \nAny time that vlAURA expires, it will be again locked as vlAURA.\n\n**Conclusion**\n \nThis proposal aims to direct $75,000 worth of treasury stablecoins towards positions in veBAL, auraBAL, and vlAURA in order to direct BAL emissions towards Beethoven pools on Optimism. The proposal will also direct 50% of protocol fees on Optimism (after 50% reduction that is allocated towards Hidden Hand bribes) to the Ethereum network on a monthly basis to purchase veBAL (16.66%), auraBAL (16.66%), and vlAURA (16.66%).\n \nA vote “For” the proposal would direct the funds towards the Ethereum network for the above purposes.\n \nA vote “Against” the proposal would not direct funds in this manner; no funds would be transferred, and the current Optimism protocol fee distribution would remain the same.\n ",

      "title": "Increase Tarot Lend Position To 750k BEETS",
      "content": "This proposal aims to create a fly wheel affect utilizing the lending feature on the Tarot protocol. This affect will use idle BEETS from the treasury to loan in the BEETS/FTM Spookyswap V2 Tarot vault. The result will earn more beets for the treasury which can be used later for various benefits such as extending emissions, incentivizing beethovenX pools, bribes, etc.\n\n**Background:**\n\nTarot (https://www.tarot.to/) is an LP leverage farming protocol that also provides lending and borrowing services in isolated pools. Tarot is a fork of the well battle tested protocol Impermax. Neither protocol has had any major security issues. Tarot has completed a Certik audit with no critical findings and 0 unresolved issues, https://www.certik.com/projects/tarot. \n\nBeethovenX treasury had previously seeded this same tarot vault by lending 500k BEETS as per governance decree.\nhttps://snapshot.org/#/beets.eth/proposal/0x9d043f98c2c2f3bf4815b462167f94dcab4980d9071337b88f73761e6734bd5c\n\n**Treasury action:**\n\nSupply another 250k BEETS to the BEETS/FTM tarot vault.\nhttps://www.tarot.to/lending-pool/250/0xe4b58eda17f7261c6e2bf8bee87f68a18eff5739\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\nCurrently the FTM supply in that vault is 25% greater than the BEETS supply. That percentage has been a continuing trend. FTM is easy to come by. BEETS however is harder to come by and a vast majority of the BEETS supplied is from the BeethovenX treasury (88% total supplied). Because beets is harder to come by than FTM, the BEETS supply amount has stagnated and is hindering the growth of more leveraged positions in that vault. Also because BEETS is harder to come by, BEETS borrow APR for similar utilization percentages as FTM, is four times higher than FTM which also hinders the growth and leveraging of that vault.\n\nBy supplying more BEETS the borrow APR for BEETS in the vault will decrease which will in turn increase the APR on leveraged positions. This leveraged APR increase will attract more people to leverage or increase their leveraged positions. This will in turn increase the demand for BEETS and the BEETS supply APR will increase. The net result is more BEETS earned for the treasury than what currently is being earned.\n\nIt is estimated that in relatively short order, if the treasury supplied more BEETS, we will soon see the return of the current supply ratios, being 25%-33% more FTM supplied. At that time governance can revisit the topic to consider yet another increase in the amount of BEETS of supplied. \n\nOver the last month the BEETS supply APR has been averaging around 20% - 30%. It currently sits at 30% and we have seen as high as 60%.\nIn the last 40 days the treasury has earned approximately 10k BEETS from the current Tarot supply position of 500k BEETS.\n\n**RISKS:**\n\nBesides the ever present risk of exploits that are inherent to the nature of DeFi, the only foreseeable risk is that of a liquidation short fall.\n\nTarot liquidations have always worked flawlessly and efficiently with only one major short fall of bad debt involving Tomb assets when the Luna meltdown triggered massive ftm liquidations. The main culprit of this however was a rather large over leveraged position of tomb assets on Market.xyz which was liquidated violently, leaving short fall bad debt on Market.xyz. The chaos then spilled over into the tarot Tomb related vaults. The BEETS/FTM vault is much smaller in value size and BEETS is not available as a collateral asset on any other major lending markets and should theoretically be insulated from such an event. Because tarot vaults are isolated, liquidations in other vaults will not affect the FTM/BEETS vault. \n",

      "title": "Bug Bounty Program v2",
      "content": "Beginning of this year we agreed to join Balancer’s Bug Bounty program with the following in-scope contracts:\n - Vault\n - WeightedPoolFactory\n - WeightedPool2TokensFactory\n - StablePoolFactory\n - Authorizer\n\nFor any bug found in one of these contracts, the severity will determine how much of the bounty we match.\n\nOur protocol uses more than just these contracts that are covered by the Balancer program. In addition to the contracts, the webapp as well as its backend are also key components of the system which need to be protected. In light of this, we propose to create our own bug bounty program together with the bug bounty platform immunefi.com. Immunefi is a bug bounty platform for blockchain projects and brings projects and hackers together, they are well-known in the industry and are used by many projects.\n\nOur bug bounty program would have the following assets in scope:\n**Contracts**\n - Beets Token\n - MasterChef\n - Timelock (MasterChef Owner)\n - BeetsBar (fBEETS)\n - MasterChef Operator \n\n**Website and applications**\nhttps://*.beets.fi\nhttps://*.beets-ftm-node.com\n\nThese assets are currently all which make Beethoven-X Beethoven-X and they need to be protected. \n\nThe bug bounty program intends to offer the following rewards, based on severity:\n\n**Smart Contracts**\nCritical\t\t10% of value, max 500k, min 50k \tUSD \nHigh\t\t    20k USD \nMedium\t\t4k \tUSD \n\n**Websites and Applications**\nCritical\t\t20k USD \nHigh\t\t    10k \tUSD \nMedium\t\t2k \tUSD \n\nImmunefi uses the following comprehensive mechanism to classify bugs into severities: https://immunefi.com/immunefi-vulnerability-severity-classification-system-v2-2/\n\nIn addition to the bounty that is paid to the bounty hunter, a 10% fee is to be paid to immuneifi.\n\nFollowing are two examples:\n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreiceu25xn5wwtdl2m2luo5aczyemztrhqicuozlwbsxylvf2jhrpue)\n    \nThe full draft of the program can be found here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_3ORSZwl8nS2Oyt6ih11zmwzlk4P3gSJfW9mM6B0R58\n\n**Widen the scope of the joint program with Balancer**\nWe approved BIP6 to join Balancers bug bounty program with the following contracts in scope: \n- Vault \n- WeightedPoolFactory \n- WeightedPool2TokensFactory \n- StablePoolFactory \n- Authorizer\n\nIn the meantime, more contracts that are covered under balancers bug bounty program are also in use by Beethoven X, but are not in scope as per BIP6. I propose to change the scope of the joint program to:\nAll Balancer v2 contracts which are part of the Balancer bug bounty program, that are also in use by Beethoven X are in scope. This also applies to any contract released in the future by Balancer and in use by Beethoven X\n\n\nThe pros: \n- Makes the protocol safer\n- Shows the industry that we are committed to safeguarding users\n- Paying bounties results in less economic damage to the protocol if an exploit is disclosed\n\nCons:\n- There are no obvious downsides\n",

      "title": "Restructure of Treasury Assets",
      "content": "**Background**\nAt the time of writing the Treasury has around $1.2m in Protocol Owned Liquidity (on both Beethoven and Liquid Driver).\nOver the last few days there have been some discussions around restructuring Treasury Balances.\n\n**Purpose**\nThis proposal aims to allow the community to revisit what exposure the Treasury has and if it would like to move liquidity from Fantom to Optimism\n\n**Method**\nDue to the recently launched Rocket Eth pool and the recent deployment of Hidden Hand on Optimism this creates a some time sensitivity around certain actions and therefore the proposal will be split into two phases:\n\n**Phase 1**\nThe aim of part 1 is to divert TVL from Fantom to Optimism in the form of transferring the A Late Quartet, Yearn Boosted to the Rocket Eth pool. There is currently $269k in the pool, representing a little over 20% of Treasuries Protocol Owned Liquidity.\nBy doing this Treasury will still have exposure to interest bearing tokens (through rETH) and will also be able to farm BAL.\nThis allocation is not fixed and Part 2 of the proposal will allow the reallocation of this balance to other pools (for example like stETH) \n\n**Things to consider**\n - Due to the upcoming new pool factories, there is already a need to start thinking about where to move the old boosted pool balances\n - If approved, part 1 of the restructure will result in more than 20% of Protocol Owned Liquidity having full exposure to the price of ETH\n - The treasury will hold liquidity on multiple networks\n - The probability of rETH losing it's peg or having it's staking rewards slashed\n - The community can update the allocation to the pool as part of Phase 2\n - The timing of Phase 2 implementation will be dependent on when the new pool factories are deployed\n\nAs per the agreement with Balancer, all farmed BAL will be bridged to mainnet in order to mint veBAL. The will happen at least quarterly, but the liquidity committee will aim to do it monthly",

      "title": "Adjust Protocol Fee Distributions",
      "content": "This is one of at least two proposals seeking to revamp the BeethovenX incentives for its gauges, enhance its swap fees and TVL, and to set the stage for a discussion about implementing a core pools proposal similar to Balancer BIP-19: https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-19-incentivize-core-pools-l2-usage/3329\n\nThe success of the first two rounds of gauge rewards generated by Balancer BIP-19 over the last month is summarized here: https://twitter.com/0xSolarcurve/status/1551608181268291587\n\nSince June 8, in the Discord channel for this BIP-24, members of the BeethovenX community have regularly discussed numerous permutations and different aspects of  this proposal. \n\nWe, the community members, now propose to reallocate the 30% of all protocol fees that are currently being distributed to fBeets holders, via Beets purchases and distributions, to be used as core pool “training wheels” gauge rewards that incentivize fBeets holders to vote for BeethovenX’s best earning pools and those we later wish to promote. The reason for reallocating this fee is our belief that incentivizing these pools will generate substantial revenue for BeethovenX and increase the protocol’s TVL.\n\nBackground / Definitions:\n- Boosted pools - some background on boosted pools can be found here. When \n   we refer to boosted pools, we mean the pools generally described in this \n   article.\n\n- IB tokens and the fee collection improvement - IB tokens are interest-bearing \n tokens. IB tokens earn additional yield from a third-party source, separate and apart from pool trading fees and Beets or other token rewards emitted for the pool on BeethovenX. Examples of IB tokens are xBOO or sFTMx. IB tokens may be components of any pool that contains them, including boosted pools and metastable pools. Upcoming improvements will allow the IB component of pool yield to be collected as part of the swap fees for the protocol. Learn more about this mechanism here. \n\n- Core pools - our references to core pools mean boosted or metastable pools that are gauge-eligible after BeethovenX has adopted some version of a core pool proposal similar to Balancer BIP-19.\n\nWe also use the terms “gauge rewards” or “gauge incentives” – not “bribes”.\nOne of the main assumptions of this proposal is that the 30% buybacks are an overall poor value proposition for BeethovenX.\n\n30% of BeethovenX’s protocol fees are presently used to buy Beets off the market and distribute them to fBeets holders by increasing the ratio of 1 fBeet to 1 Fidelio Duetto BPT. As of this writing, because of the buybacks, 1 fBeet = 1.0245 Fidelio Duetto BPTs. This benefits fBEETS holders in the form of an increasing value of fBEETS token.\n\nHowever, the actual value increase has been minimal, with a current yield of only ~1.65%APR.\n\nWe believe that both users and Beethoven X would benefit by reallocating this fee as such: \n \n- 30% of all fees earned by the protocol instead become gauge vote incentives applied equally to Fantom of the Opera (FoTO) and Late Quartet (LQ), BeethovenX's two highest earning pools at present. This allocation will be modified to transition these same incentives to the FoTO and LQ boosted pools upon their launch as soon as reasonably possible. It also may be modified in the future, at the discretion of the Liquidity Committee and subject to dialogue and governance, as outlined below.\n\n- Incorporating the current portion of fees used for buybacks into the latest gauge vote, results in the two pools receiving roughly 9-11% of the votes. (*this is an estimate, only; actual results will of course vary).\n\n- According to calculations from the last gauge vote, this would return users roughly ~$7 for every $1000 of fBEETS voted with, resulting in a  0.7% ROI for clicking a few buttons every two weeks. \n\n- Beethoven simultaneously ensures that pools generating or likely to generate substantial revenue receive a substantial portion of gauge votes and rewards. This could instigate a flywheel effect as such:\nGauge rewards from 30% fees > TVL increases in pool > Increase in users interacting with pool > Revenue from fees increase ...\n\nWe propose that the 30% protocol fees be collected once a month. The fees will be converted to Beets and allocated as incentives for the pools outlined herein for each gauge vote.\n\nAs soon as reasonably possible after new FoTO and LQ boosted pools are available, the 30% gauge rewards and emissions will be transitioned to the new boosted pools. The manner through which the 30% and the emissions will be transitioned and applied to boosted FoTO and LQ will be within the discretion of the Liquidity Committee, which shall evaluate the proper manner to implement these “training wheels” in regular  discussions that occur in a new dedicated channel in the BeethovenX Discord server, accessible only to Early Ludwig NFT holders. The decisions of the Liquidity Committee and its discretion on these matters will ultimately be subject to the determination of fBeets governance. If a governance proposal is required on any of these issues in the future, it will be subject to open discussion and then a governance vote.\n\nAs the TVL grows and, upon the adoption of a core pool proposal and the transition of boosted  FoTO and LQ to steady flywheel gauge rewards, it will be within the discretion of the Liquidity Committee to determine when, where, and how much of the 30% should be reallocated to new core pools that then generate or appear reasonably likely to generate substantial swap fees and/or increase the protocol’s TVL. This process will then iterate and repeat with respect to additional core pools.\nPROS:\n \n-        Users are likely to receive a greater return in gauge incentives compared to fBEETS buybacks.\n \n-        Community engagement. Gauge rewards and votes are a great way of increasing engagement. Compared to earning 1-3% a year on current fBEET distributions, a bounty of gauge rewards is much simpler to entice new users to engage in our ecosystem. Fantom offers a cheap, fast and simple interface for new users to begin their gauge vote journey.\n \n-        Kicking off a flywheel effect. By incentivizing the pools that return or are likely to return the greatest revenue, the increase in gauge rewards > increase in TVL > increase in revenue.\n\n-        IB core pools. These pools will bring BeethovenX a sustainable revenue source. If we can sync the introduction of these pools with the reallocated 30%, this could ensure a fast adoption of these pools on Fantom. As the fee earned on these IB core pools is distributed in the same manner as all fees, if we changed the 30% distribution to gauge rewards, they would effectively be paying for their own gauge incentives without having to rely every two weeks on having a third-party protocol do it (from the fee on 30% fee on IB yield + 30% fee on swaps) - similar to BIP-19 on Balancer.\n \n-        By ensuring that the 30% of the protocol fees are converted to Beets to be used as gauge incentives, we will not affect the current monthly buy pressure on Beets on account of the current distribution  program.\n \nCONS:\n-        Buybacks are easier for users unwilling to engage in gauge votes.\n \n-        This reallocation could have a negative effect on third-party protocols interested in providing gauge rewards because they will now be competing against the protocol itself.\n \n-        This adds complexity to the manual collection of fees as we also now have to seed and disburse the 30%.\n \n-        We may not agree upon or implement a subsequent core pool proposal.\n \n-        The Liquidity Committee could go rogue.\n  \nSPECIFICATION\nIf approved, the following will be in effect:\n\n1.      30% of all fees earned by the protocol will become gauge incentives, initially, equally to FoTO / LQ, then their boosted versions (as soon as reasonably possible following their launch in accordance with specs. 2 & 3 below), and then additional core pools (also in accordance with specs. 2 & 3 below).\n \n2.      A new channel accessible to Early Ludwig NFT holders will be created in the Discord server for the Liquidity Committee and the community to have discourse on the method, timing, logistics, issues concerning, reallocations of, and seeding, and disbursing the 30% protocol fee as gauge rewards to, initially, FoTO and LQ. The Liquidity Committee shall communicate in this channel on a regular basis with open and continuous communications.\n \n3.      As the TVL grows and, upon the adoption of a core pool proposal and the transition of boosted of FoTO and LQ to steady flywheel gauge rewards, it will be within the discretion of the Liquidity Committee to determine when, where, and how much of the 30% should be reallocated to new core pools that then generate or appear reasonably likely to generate substantial swap fees and/or increase the protocol’s TVL. This process will then iterate and repeat with respect to additional core pools.\n \n4.      Protocol fee collection, distribution, and any subsequent gauge incentives will take place once per month, will be converted to Beets, and the Beets will be allocated as gauge rewards during each voting round to the pools per specs. 1-3 above.\n \n5.      Following the adoption of this proposal, we will open a new BIP channel for the purpose of discussing the specifics of the core pool proposal that fBeets intends to bring to an upcoming governance vote.\n",

      "content": "We propose to increase the protocol fee percentage of Beethoven X on Fantom. Currently, the protocol fee is set at 15% (which means 85% of the trading fee goes to the liquidity providers and 15% is collected as protocol fee). \n\nPros:\n1. This would lead to more assets accumulation to treasury; \n2. This would benefit fBEETS holders in terms of more buy-back and distributions; \n3. It would also increase the funds available for team salary,  and the Beethoven X-fund. \n\nCons:\nThis might make the platform appear less attractive to liquidity providers. \nIt is important to keep in mind that this is a decrease in swap fees portion of the APR alone - farming rewards and BEETS distribution, which make up the majority of rewards in most pools on Beethoven X, would be unaffected. \n \n\n",

      "title": "Approval proposal to optimism collective  ",
      "content": "We propose to authorize the draft for Balancer/BeethovenX's request for Optimism incentives:\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1lTUOyY6FrsV3YragJbab6y7kEFO0eDAHq-GW2C725No/edit?usp=sharing\n\ntldr\n\n- BEETS allocates half our share of Optimism protocol fees (25% of total protocol fees) towards bribing veBAL for the pools that generated those fees. \n- We ask for some amount of OP to use as veBAL bribes\n- On a monthly basis, the 25% protocol fees would be matched 1:1 $ value with OP and put towards bribes on the pools that generated those fees over the next month. \n\nThe 3M BEETS we have already approved for veBAL bribing would be used early on to help bring protocol fees up to a meaningful level. From there, the above flywheel would be left to do its thing. \n\n**What you are voting for:** To endorse this proposal and allocate half of BEETS share of Optimism revenue towards veBAL bribes until we vote to stop doing that. **This would only take effect if our proposal to Optimism is approved by their governance.**\n\n**Why Give Up Half of BEETS' Share of Fees:**\nThe only way we will earn fees on Optimism is by getting veBAL voters to direct BAL emissions to us. 3M BEETS and even OP will only make that happen for so long. Partners who bribe for their own pools is great and helpful but this will not get us to #1 on Optimism. We must have bribes on core pools that can generate strong fees and bring high TVL.\n\nHow do we fund these core pool bribes? I see three choices: share of protocol fees, treasury assets, or emissions from Fantom. By choosing a share of protocol fees, it ties the size of bribes with the usage of our Optimism deployment - as we gain market share we generate more fees which leads to higher bribes which leads to more BAL emissions which leads to more TVL which leads to more market share -> etc.\n\nBEETS voluntarily making this choice also protects against Balancer deciding to adjust the rev split in the future, as this effectively turns the agreement into a 25%/75% split but on favorable terms for BEETS as our bribes are paid for. veBAL only gets those bribes if they give us their votes, and every vote for Optimism is money for fBEETS holders. \n\nA final benefit is any project that parks liquidity with us gets \"free\" bribes if their pool is added to veBAL voting. This would be a very powerful market narrative in my opinion that no other Optimism exchange could match. \n\n**Can we ask veBAL to also give half their fees to bribes:**\nThe first impression many might have is this is unfair to BEETS if Balancer doesn't do the same. The key point to understand is that veBAL is funding Optimism emissions, not BEETS. Every vote to Optimism is money out of veBAL pocket and into BEETS pocket. If veBAL gave up their fees for bribes they are helping BEETS take more and more of their money. \n\nA key tenet of our proposal to Balancer to do Optimism for them is that we take the role of driving growth on Optimism, meaning we spend money to get veBAL voters to direct emissions there. We cannot ask veBAL to spend money to do that. \n",

      "title": "Using Treasury Assets for Optimism Incentives",
      "content": "**Motivation**\n\nAs many of you are aware we recently experienced some unexpected behavior in the boosted pools when UST and DEI depegged. This combined with the recent bug disclosures has altered the development priorities of Balancer Labs for the next month or two. We initially planned to launch on Optimism with veBAL gauges and voting but we should consider an alternative approach that can get us online much quicker. \n\nWe propose BeethovenX joining Balancer in allocating $250k towards Optimism incentives through traditional liquidity mining over a two month period. This would be in addition to the “up to 3M BEETS” already authorized for use in bribing veBAL. Given the record low BEETS price of late we suggest using 250k USDC from the treasury to use as BeethovenX’s half of the incentives. Balancer would match with 31,250 BAL ($250k at $8 BAL). Once veBAL integration is completed any unused funds would be returned to the treasury and bribing would begin as originally planned. The 250K USDC would either be used directly as incentive or be used to market purchase BEETS to be used as incentives, determined by the outcome of the vote. \n\nThis arrangement allows us to move quickly with the launch instead of waiting an unknown amount of time for the veBAL integration to be completed. It does carry a substantial cost which must be weighed against the value of launching as soon as possible. The liquidity committee would have discretion over where the incentives are allocated and will coordinate with their counterparts at Balancer.\n\nIf this vote fails to pass or the corresponding Balancer vote fails to pass, neither side will move forward with providing incentives. \n\n**Options**\n1. Allocate 250K USDC from treasury to market buy BEETS and used as farming incentives; \n2. Allocate 250K USDC from treasury to be used directly as farming incentives; \n3. Do not use treasury to provide farming incentives. \n\nNote that option 3 will win only if it has more votes than options 1 and 2 combined. ",

      "title": "Deployment and Managing Balancer on Optimism",
      "content": "**Introduction**\n\nIn October of last year we launched our second coming on earth using Balancer technology on Fantom. \n\nWith that we launched the first official Balancer friendly fork and since then we have been actively working on pushing the capabilities of the technology to its full extent. All of these efforts have not gone unnoticed, in this time it has strengthened the relationship we have with Balancer.\n\nThe relationship is now potentially expanding and with the prospect of Optimism launching its token and kicking off what could be an explosive summer of growth. An opportunity has once again presented itself to push the boundaries of what we can do, but this time as part of something bigger. \n\n**Proposal**\n\nWe propose that BeethovenX takes charge of an official Balancer deployment on Optimism. This will include contract deployment, front end, infrastructure, branding, marketing, communications and ongoing maintenance as required. Balancer will on their end activate gauge votes to Optimism, liquidity mining will be in the form of BAL and not BEETS.\n\nNot only this would help Balancer expand their ecosystem on a promising layer 2 scaling solution of ethereum. It will also bring about a stronger bond between us and Balancer. A partnership between the two of us, we will be seen as a protocol that is working together with one of the original DEFI bluechip protocols.\n\n**Motivation**\n\nIn order to bootstrap adoption and secure the position as a leading Optimism dex, we request an initial allocation of up to 3M $BEETS from the treasury. This will be used over the course of six months in order to provide incentives to veBAL voters to direct BAL emissions to the Optimism pools. \n\nAny farming by either protocol’s treasury on Optimism is acceptable with the condition that earned BAL rewards are either locked in veBAL or held on the balance sheet. No farming and dumping. \n\nThe Balancer optimism governance multisig would have five members, three Balancer community members and two from BeethovenX. \n\nBalancer has their protocol fee set at 50%, this is what will be used on Optimism. The fee will be shared 50/50 between Balancer and BeethovenX. The BeethovenX part of the protocol fee income will be distributed under the same rule as the protocol revenue of BeethovenX. As a reminder that is:\n- 50% to the DAO treasury\n- 30% to fBEETS holders\n- 18% to the team\n- 2% to the Beethoven X-fund\n\nWhat this means is, if we had to replicate the exact same circumstances on Optimism, as we have here on Fantom, only 60% of the current volume is required to achieve the same revenue to $fBEETS holders.\n\n*Summary*\nWe emphasize that this is a Balancer deployment on Optimism, operated and managed by the BeethovenX team. BeethovenX has no intention of leaving Fantom - all of our usual emissions are kept on Fantom. This is a unique opportunity for BeethovenX and fBEETS holders to expand to Optimism, and by acting early we can secure a large share, hopefully the majority share, of the dex market there. If it succeeds, this would be a huge win for both protocols. \n\nIn total, it will be up to approximately 3m $BEETS used in the process over the span of six months. For context, the treasury currently holds 9.4m $BEETS. \nWhile this is a sizeable portion of the $BEETS held, in return we would get:\n- Close integration with the Balancer ecosystem\n- An additional revenue stream for all Beethoven stakeholders\n- Huge upside potential from layer 2 scaling of Ethereum\n- BAL through Treasury farming\n\n**Specification**\n\nTo approve the optimism launch and authorisation to use up to 3m $BEETS for voting incentives to veBAL holders\nIf the proposal passes, both on our and Balancer’s governance, the BeethovenX team will begin working on Balancer Optimism deployment as soon as possible. \n",

      "title": "Implementing vote locking for fBEETS",
      "content": "We propose to implement vote locking for fBEETS. \n\nThe fBEETS locking has been discussed extensively on discord. \nHere is a link to a recent AMA we had and the associated slides\nhttps://discordapp.com/channels/885764705526882335/886065257255153664/953765755474808912\n\nKey points are:\n - The locking period is measured in epochs, where 1 epoch = 1 week\n - The lock duration of 12 epochs (12 weeks)\n - The start of an epoch is always at the same day and time of the week\n - Newly locked fBEETS will only be able to vote from the start of the next epoch\n - Relocked fBEETS get the benefits immediately\n - fBEETS are only unlocked at the end of the 12 epochs \n - Only locked fBEETS will be eligible for voting\n\n**Rewards**\nCurrent model\n - 100% of all fBEETS emissions go to the fBEETS farm\n - 30% of the protocol fees goes to fBEETS holders\n\nFuture model\n - 50% of fBEETS emissions will go to all fBEETS holders, regardless whether locked or not\n - 50% of fBEETS emissions will only go to lockers\n - 30% of the protocol fees will only go to lockers\n\n**Implementation requirement**\nThe implementation of the locking contract means that the emissions will be released over the course of an epoch (week). To ensure that the correct rewards get distributed, the locking contract needs to be frontloaded with the emissions for the upcoming epoch. As the masterchef can only mint on a per block basis it is not able to frontload the contract while keeping emissions to the current fBEETS farm. In order to manage the change over, we would like to borrow the first epoch (week’s) emissions from the treasury. This amounts to approximately 105k BEETS and it can only be repaid once we reach the end of the emission schedule.\n\nPro\n- Align interest of long term share holders of the protocol; \n- Reduce gaming of the voting system; \n- Likely Increase incentives for fBEETS lockers; \n\nCon\n- Locking may impact partner protocols to integrate fBEETS; \n- The synchronous unlocking time for each epoch might cause short term price instability of BEETS. \n\nFor more discussions, please go to our discord at \nhttps://discord.gg/beethovenx and discuss in the dedicated channel for BIP. \n",

      "content": "We propose to continue the bonding program at Olympus Pro to gain DAO Treasury owned liquidity. \n\nRecall that according to BIP2 and BIP9, we have used bonding program with Olympus Pro for about 3 months. 550k BEETS were used for bonding each month in exchange of A Late Quartet (FTM-USDC-ETH-BTC weighted pool) liquidity. \n\nCurrently, the bonding program has gained around 8576 A Late Quartet liquidity token (currently worth $1.12m). In other words, the treasury has gained $1.12m worth of major token liquidity. In exchange, around 1.5M BEETS were distributed (currently worth $1.18m). Overall discount around 4.33% (which includes the 3.3% fee Olympus Pro takes). \n\nOverall, the bonding program has been quite successful in diversifying the treasury assets and also offered discounted BEETS to long term holders. Owning major asset liquidity such as ftm-usdc-eth-btc enables long term prosperity of our treasury. \n\nThus, we propose to continue the bonding program for another three (3) months. Since the BEETS emission is going down, we propose to use 460k BEETS each month (around 16.4% reduction from the current 550K per month rate). \n\n",

You can vote for as many and as few pools as you wish. The aggregate distribution of responses will be used to determine the investment. \n\nRecall that only 50% of the treasury investment is up for the vote. Both the Steady Beets and Fantom of the Opera (yearn boosted) pools will receive 25% base allocation.\n\nOnce the voting is complete, the top two pools from the vote will get 25% each in addition. Note that based on the previous month voting results and feedback, we narrow down the pool choice to make it easier to decide between different investment portfolios. \n",

      "title": "OTC Selling veNFT #20 ",
      "content": "We ask our community to decide whether the treasury should sell its veNFT #20 in an over-the-counter (OTC) swap for $1M in stablecoin, as is currently offered to us. We are also open to other buyers with potential higher bids over the voting period. \n\nThe revenue of the sale will be split between the treasury holdings and also as protocol revenue sharing with fBEETS holders, while details will be postponed to further governance votes, potentially combined with discussions for fBEETS locking. \n\nThe current information of veNFT #20 BeethovenX treasury holds can be found below (note that this week's rebase has not been claimed by the treasury)  \n|                               | veNFT #20  |         \n|----------------------|------------------|\n|      SOLID locked   |    865,647.29  |   \n|      Vest Expires    |   2026-03-18   | \n\nPro:\n1. This generates an immediate income for the protocol (and eventually to the treasury and/or fBEETS holders); \n2. As the treasury is under multisig, it will not be able to actively manage the veNFT for fee farming, and thus holding the veNFT generates little income; \n3. As this will be an OTC swap, it won't cause market damage of SOLID and potentially impact other protocols and users;\n\nCon:\n1. The veNFT #20 was airdropped to BeethovenX as a \"free\" gift, and hence BeethovenX treasury does not really have any cost needs to recover from the sale; \n2. BeethovenX will lose its veNFT #20 and consequently its voting power over Solidly (in particular the BEETS/fBEETS farm on solidly would likely no longer be incentivized); \n3. In case Solidly becomes successful in the long run, BeethovenX would lose its share of the protocol (recall that solid locked in veNFT will not be diluted); \n4. The pricing of speculative assets like SOLID is extremely difficult, so it is hard to judge the fair value of the sale. \n\nPlease cast your vote under serious considerations. \nFor more discussion, please go to our discord channel at https://discord.gg/cUAUNVev\n",

      "title": "Treasury token exchange with Spookyswap",
      "content": "We propose to conduct a token exchange (BEETS <> BOO) with Spookyswap treasury, to enhance the collaboration and synergy of leading fantom protocols. \n\nPer agreement of the two protocols, the exchanged tokens will not be used for farming or governance vote, until possibly revised by future governance votes. \n\nThe swap rate will be based on weekly TWAP (time weighted average price) and will be conducted in two batches. \n\nPro:\n1. This would help diversify the treasury holdings; \n2. The token swap would align the interest of the two protocols, which helps long term collaborations of the two protocols. One such collaboration in near term is the boosted BOO-FTM 80/20 pool, for which Spookyswap has shown great interest; we envision further collaborations between the two leading dexes in the future; \n3. This would set an impactful example for other leading protocols in the fantom ecosystem to partner, which would be beneficial to the entire fantom defi ecosystem. \n\nCon: \n1. This increases the treasury exposure to a potentially volatile asset; \n2. It is hard to predict the price action of the tokens in the long run to judge the timing of the swap. \n\nOptions:\n1. Yes, treasury swap for 500k BEETS in total; \n2. Yes, treasury swap for 250k BEETS in total; \n3. No, we don't want treasury swap. \n\nPlease note that the Yes votes are counted in aggregate when determining to proceed, in other words No needs to obtain more than 50% of the votes for the proposal not to pass.",

      "title": "Joining 0xDAO partnership",
      "content": "This proposal considers whether Beethoven X should join the 0xDAO partnership and transfer its veNFT to 0xDAO. \n\n0xDAO v2 was launched last week as a yield optimizer for Solidly and offers partner protocols to exchange veNFT for oxSOLID at a 1:1 rate of the locked SOLID in veNFT (#20 in the case of BeethovenX). \n\nAt the time of writing of the proposal, the status of veNFT #20 is listed below \n|                               | veNFT #20  |         \n|----------------------|------------------|\n|      SOLID locked   |    749,145.46  |\n|      Voting Power     |    744,269.91      |   \n|      Vest Expires    |   2026-03-04   | \n\n\nPros: \n1. This would likely strengthen our relation with other 0xDAO partner protocols; \n2. This will make our veNFT position liquid by exchanging that with oxSOLID, which can be sold on market or staked to earn SOLID and OXD emissions. \n3. As a partner, we will also receive partner benefit for OXD emission, which is the governance token of 0xDAO and determines the solidly gauge vote of the SOLID owned by 0xDAO. The emission formula is complicated and please refer to \nhttps://docs.oxdao.fi/general-information/0xdao-for-launch-partners\n4. In the long run, if 0xDAO dominates SOLID, we will have a stronger position in the Solidly ecosystem. \n\nCons: \n1. We will lose the direct voting power by our own veNFT, and our voting power would be indirect through OXD (though it is possible to sell oxSOLID to get some SOLID back); \n2. At least initially, we would have less gauge voting power (unless we market buy OXD), and thus the BEETS/fBEETS pool on solidly will likely receive less SOLID emissions; \n3. Joining the partnership would expose us to additional smart contract risks of 0xDAO. \n\nNote that due to the need of active managing SOLID, oxSOLID, OXD positions, the vote outcome will also grant the treasury management of the corresponding assets. \nIn particular, if we vote to join 0xDAO, the treasury will manage oxSOLID, OXD, and SOLID positions obtained from 0xDAO; and if we vote not to join, the treasury will manage SOLID accumulated from our farming position on Solidly and also collected as protocol revenue of BeethovenX. \n\nOptions:\n1. Yes. Join 0xDAO as a partner. \n2. No. Keep managing veNFT ourselves.",

You can vote for as many and as few pools as you wish. The aggregate distribution of responses will be used to determine the investment. \n\nRecall that only 50% of the treasury investment is up for the vote. Both the Steady Beets and Fantom of the Opera pools will receive 25% base allocation (either the original version of the boosted pool). \n\nOnce the voting is complete, the top two pools will get 25% each in addition. Note that based on the previous month voting results and feedback, we narrow down the pool choice to make it easier to decide between different investment portfolios. \n",

      "content": "This is a proposal from community member Alfalfa or Spanky\n\nTarot currently has a proposal up for providing Tarot incentives for its farms (see https://vote.tarot.to/#/proposal/0x5b15bb582bd9342fdf5c5af647ac39eab7f7e52c325d39912ed9a86896566e04). \n\nOne of those farms is the Beets-FTM LP available through Spooky. We previously passed BIP-7 and authorized the treasury to seed Beets liquidity in this pool (see https://snapshot.org/#/beets.eth/proposal/0x7e5968a133f31debd4a9e4b5e14ddb44645cbf15fe0164019104f9ad6c925291). The treasury is currently supplying 50,000 Beets and earning supply APRs on them. To further align ourselves with Tarot and ramp up this farm even more (and further ramp up the %APR the treasury gets for supplying its Beets), I propose that we initiate a vote ASAP for the treasury to provide a Beets incentive to those xTarot holders who vote in favor of incentivizing the Beets-FTM LP on Tarot. We can take care of this through an airdrop program similar to what we saw last week with our own dear gauge vote. Even better, with our next gauge vote coming up very soon on BeetX, I have to imagine that passing a proposal like this will only increase the likelihood of Tarot offering a similar incentive for our own dear BeetX gauges. \n\nNote that the Tarot proposal is ongoing and will end on 17th, so there's no time to waste.\n\nPROS\n1 - A Beets incentive increases the likelihood of Tarot rewards being provided to the Beets-FTM LP farm on Tarot\n\n2 - If the Beets incentive works to provide Tarot rewards for the farm, then the extra Tarot rewards will likely further increase the usage of the Tarot farm and are likely to increase even further the Beets reward APRs that the treasury is already receiving for supplying its Beets (and theoretically will work to cancel out any Beets that we use to incentivize the vote)\n\n3 - This proposal will increase the community and collaboration between BeetX and Tarot\n\n4 - This proposal will increase the likelihood of the Tarot community providing a similar incentive for our upcoming gauge vote\n\nCONS\n1 - we lose the Tarot reward vote and wind up spending some of the treasury's Beets without receiving a direct return on investment\n",

      "title": "Treasury farming on Solidly ",
      "content": "We propose to use treasury assets to farm $SOLID at solidly. \n\nSolidly (also known as solidswap) is a new dex built by Andre Cronje with a gauge voting model for farming incentives. Beethoven X owns 2.937% of the voting power at launch, which can be used to assign $SOLID incentives to pools. While this is a good start, in the long run, the initial voting power will get diluted. It is thus desirable for our treasury to farm $SOLID and lock into our veNFT to accumulate more voting power. \n\nPro: \n1. Our holding of veNFT gives a boost (up to 2.5x) in $SOLID farming reward if we use treasury to farm;\n2. More voting power will enable BeethovenX to incentivize pools that benefit fBEETS holders and the protocol; \n3. More voting power will also earn BeethovenX potential bribes and trading fees for solidly pools;\n\nCon: \n1. Solidly as a new dAPP comes with potential smart contract risks. \n\nOptions: \n1. Use treasury to farm $SOLID without cap; \n2. Use treasury to farm $SOLID with a cap of $400k USD worth of assets;\n3. Use treasury to farm $SOLID with a cap of $200k USD worth of assets;\n4. Do not use treasury to farm \n\nNote that this is a ranked vote. \nPlease rank your preference and try to make your ranking consistent (for example 1 > 3 > 2 is an inconsistent ranking).  ",

      "title": "Continuing Olympus Pro bonding program",
      "content": "We propose to continue the bonding program at Olympus Pro to gain DAO Treasury owned liquidity. \n\nRecall that according to BIP2, we initiate a bonding program with Olympus Pro about 3 weeks ago. 550k BEETS were used for bonding in exchange of A Late Quartet (FTM-USDC-ETH-BTC weighted pool) liquidity. \n\nAt the writing of the proposal, the bonding program has gained around 2227 A Late Quartet liquidity token (currently worth around $297K). In other words, the treasury has gained $297K worth of major token liquidity. In exchange, 500k BEETS were distributed (currently worth $400K). Overall discount around 25% (which includes the 3.3% fee Olympus Pro takes).  Note that since BEETS has increased in price lately much more in comparison to the Late Quarter BPT, the actual average discount during bonding has been less.\n\nOverall, the pilot program is successful in diversifying the treasury assets and also offered discounted BEETS to long term holders. Owning major asset liquidity such as ftm-usdc-eth-btc enables long term prosperity of our treasury. \n\nThus, we propose to continue the bonding program at the same rate of BEETS supply for another two months. The liquidity token under consideration is either A Late Quartet or Steady Beets, Yearn Boosted. \n\nVoting options: \n1. Bonding for two months of A Late Quartet liquidity;\n2. Bonding for two months of Steady Beets, Yearn Boosted liquidity; \n3. Bonding for one month of A Late Quartet and one month for Steady Beets, Yearn Boosted liquidity;\n4. No, do not continue the bonding program. ",

      "content": "Motivation: In the very recent snapshot vote on treasury investment, the Symphony No. X BEETS 80 / USDC 20 pool ends up the 2nd highest option. \nhttps://snapshot.org/#/beets.eth/proposal/0xf2a38141322c4141ff474c25a68e67db158e37aacc2d698bc06a03edeee35c87 \n\nHowever, as the pool was established in the early days of the protocol. It has certain drawbacks that make it not favorable to be used as protocol-owned-liquidity. In particular, the pool has a fixed swap fee. It is better to optimize the liquidity before treasury investment. \n\nAccordingly, the liquidity committee proposes to revise the investment options into one of following pools. \n\nOption 1: fBEETS - USDC 50 / 50 pool with dynamic swapping fee (initially set at 5%)\nOption 2: BEETS - USDC 50 / 50 pool with dynamic swapping fee (initially set at 5%) \nOption 3: fBEETS - USDC 80 / 20 pool with dynamic swapping fee (initially set at 2%)\nOption 4: a new BEETS - USDC 80 / 20 pool with dynamic swapping fee (initially set at 2%)\n\nThe design of a 50 / 50 pool with 5% swapping fee is for the purpose of volatility farming, since the treasury will not stake its liquidity in BeethovenX farms, the liquidity is better designed to benefit from volatility of BEETS price. Such pool is another unique strategy enabled by Balancer tech, one could learn more about volatility farming in \nhttps://medium.com/balancer-protocol/case-study-harvesting-volatility-with-a-50-50-balancer-pool-5a6fdb8f2e41\n\nUsing fBEETS-USDC (compared with BEETS-USDC) has the following pros and cons \nPros:\n1. Using fBEETS to pair with USDC would enable treasury to hold more BEETS-FTM liquidity (underlying fBEETS);\n2. It offers direct trading liquidity for fBEETS;\n3. It might offer exciting strategy for BeethovenX to utilize the upcoming Solidswap (the plan is not finalized yet)\n\nCons:\n1. fBEETS will likely have less trading volume compared with BEETS, thus the fBEETS-USDC pair would earn less from trading fees for the treasury; \n2. It consists effectively less BEETS in the liquidity (since fBEETS only has 80% BEETS in it)\n\nAlso note that treasury holding fBEETS will take a portion of the protocol revenue share going to fBEETS holders (though the amount is negligible). \n\n25% of the treasury part of protocol revenue will be used to buy back BEETS and provide liquidity according to the winning option. \n\nRegardless of the outcome, the treasury will build up protocol-owned-liquidity for BEETS, this will benefit the protocol in the long run. It will also set an example of how flexible liquidity can be managed on BeethovenX.",

You can vote for as many and as few farms as you wish. The aggregate distribution of responses will be used to determine the investment. \n\nRecall that only 50% of the treasury investment is up for the vote. Both the Steady Beets and Fantom of the Opera pools will receive 25% base allocation. \n\nOnce the voting is complete, the top two pools will get 25% each in addition. Note that only official pools are included in this vote, we might expand the list to community pools for the next two votes. \n\n",

      "title": "Seeding Tarot BEETS vaults by treasury",
      "content": "This is a proposal from community member Alfalfa or Spanky?#7409 on discord.\n\nThe Tarot vault for Spooky's FTM/Beets pool offers a high leveraged 3x APR. However, the vault is greatly lacking in the lending supply of both FTM and Beets.\n\nI don't think this vault will get much use until enough Beets and FTM are supplied to ensure that leveraged borrowing is available. So, I think we need to \"kickstart\" the vault (for lack of a better term).\n\nI believe the use of this vault for leveraged borrowing will be a benefit to the Beethoven community. First, I believe it is likely to cause more Beets to be purchased to pair with FTM, make the LP in Spooky, and then deposit the LP into Tarot. Second, I believe it is likely to cause more Beets to be supplied as collateral on Tarot. Third, if a leveraged borrower avoids liquidation and enjoys high APR for 3x leverage (or whatever higher or lower leverage the borrower is comfortable with), then the borrower's FTM/Beets 50/50 LP will increase in accordance with that APR (or whatever lower or higher APR is available at the time). I believe the most likely result from this scenario is it will increase the amount of Fidelio Duetto BPTs and the amount of fBeets minted. Existing community members may also use leveraged borrowing through the Tarot vault to increase their overall supply of Beets and FTM and then to pair more Fidelio Duettos and mint more fBeets. Alternatively, we can single stake Beets as supply, and enjoy whatever APR is available..\n\nIn order to \"kickstart\" this vault on Tarot, I suggest that the Beets Treasury provide Beets as collateral to the vault. Some amount between 25,000 - 50,000 Beets should be sufficient. We currently have 6,459,428.4679 Beets in the treasury. We will let the market decide to fund a proportionate amount if FTM.\n\nPROS\n\n1 - the amount of our Treasury's Beets will increase in accordance with the supply APR available on Tarot\n\n2 - likely to cause more buy pressure on Beets to pair them with FTM, make the LP in Spooky, and then deposit that into Tarot (or to supply as one-sided collateral)\n\n3 - likely to cause more Fidelio Duetto LBPs (and fBeets) to be minted from borrower's rewards\n\n4 - may strengthen our relationship with Spooky by directing more TVL to Spooky's pool\n\n5 - may strength our relationship with Tarot\n\nCONS\n\n1 - additional smart contract risk\n\n2 - if leveraged borrowing maxes out, the Treasury may not be able to immediately withdraw its Beets from the Tarot supply vault. (not a big deal IMO because we are not likely to need the Beets immediately, they will eventually be released - smart contract risks aside - and we will continue to earn APR on them until they are released, including from heightened borrowing, liquidations, etc.)\n\n3 - will eventually reduce the yield available to other Beets owners (for supplying Beets as collateral). (also not a big deal IMO because the APR sucks now anyway - needs to be kickstarted).\n\nhttps://www.tarot.to/lending-pool/250/0x2e0b129d3dd14fcd676695c0a7ddef9fcc13e74e",

      "content": "In order to further increase the communities management of the treasury, we propose for the community to vote on how some of the protocol fees are applied to the POL (Protocol Owned Liquidity) model. \n\nFor a three month trial period, the request is that a monthly community vote is held to determine the allocation of 50% of the protocol fees generated in that month. \nThis would be in the form of a snapshot vote, similar to what is being done for the gauge votes for farming incentives. \n\nOnly 50% is up for the vote, as base allocation of 25% to both the Steady Beets and Fantom of the Opera pools has been made (Late Quartet is excluded from the base allocation as it is being accumulated under BIP2)\n\nOnce the voting is complete, the top two pools will get 25% each. \n\nPros: - Gives fBeets holders more control over the treasury \n\nCons: - Bad actors could hijack the vote and elect high risk, highly volatile pools \n\nPlease note that the monthly vote will only determine the allocation of that month’s fees. \n\nPre-existing balances will remain as is. If a rebalance of the treasury is required a separate vote will be had. The topic is open for discussion.\n\nOnce the three month trial has completed, the proposal will be revisited.",

      "content": "We propose to put some portion of the liquidity tokens in the treasury assets into LiquidDriver farms to acquire LQDR. Currently, the treasury holds about $180K worth of liquidity tokens (FTM-USDC and FTM-USDC-ETH-BTC) that can be used for farming on LiquidDriver. The farmed LQDR will be held in the treasury, its use will be decided by future governance votes.\n\nPros: \n1. this would put some portion of the treasury assets in further use, to accumulate LQDR;\n2. as LiquidDriver plans to work closely with BeethovenX to acquire fBEETS, getting LQDR for the treasury would help better align interests of the two protocols; \n3. in case that LiquidDriver acquires a huge portion of fBEETS in the future, holding LQDR (in the form of staked xLQDR) would give DAO treasury more voting power; \n\nCons:\n1. it exposes our treasury fund to additional smart contract risks (while the LQDR contract involved is a variant of the battle tested Sushi masterchef contract), interacting with any smart contract involves risk;\n2. it will dilute the farm on LiquidDriver.\n\nOptions (the one with majority vote wins): \n1. Yes, deploy treasury assets to the farm with a cap of 50% of liquidity tokens;\n2. Yes, deploy treasure assets to the farm with a cap of 25% of liquidity tokens;\n3. No, more discussion needed.\n\nAbout LiquidDriver: LiquidDriver is the first liquidity mining dApp providing liquidity-as-a-service in the Fantom ecosystem. They aim to bring its users more utility, rewards, and long-term benefits through their native token, LQDR, and ultimately become the leading liquidity-on-demand platform for dApps on the Fantom Opera Mainnet.",

This proposal would help decentralize the decision making process and also increase utility for fBEETS. \nThe gauge mechanism would also facilitate onboarding other project in the fantom ecosystem to host their liquidity on BeethovenX and vote for farming incentives through holding fBEETS. \n\nIf the gauge mechanism is approved, 30% of the total farming emissions will be decided by fBEETS holders every two weeks through a snapshot vote (snapshot taken at a random block to prevent gaming the system). This 30% allocation percentage might increase in the future if the mechanism turns out to be successful. \n\nfBEETS holders would have the option of allocating a percentage of the rewards to the pools. The aggregate distribution from all users vote would be used to determine BEETS incentives for the next epoch lasting for two weeks.\n\nIn addition to BeethovenX official investment pools, fBEETS holders can also request to add a community pool to the gauge vote, upon security checks and approval by the liquidity committee.\n\nQuorum Standards\nThe option with the most votes will be adopted.",

      "title": "Using Olympus Pro to gain DAO treasury owned liquidity",
      "content": "We propose BeethovenX to participate in Olympus Pro to gain DAO Treasury owned liquidity. Through Olympus Pro, users can exchange A Late Quartet liquidity token (FTM-USDC-ETH-BTC weighted pool) for BEETS using bonding.\n\nThe BEETS used in the bonding will be taken from farm emissions, and hence this will further build up the DAO treasury (in addition to the 50% protocol fee and 10% BEETS max supply). Owning major asset liquidity such as ftm-usdc-eth-btc would increase the diversity of the DAO treasury and ensure long term prosperity. This will benefit BEETS holders as treasury owners and also the protocol.\n\nDetails of the proposal:\nThe initial trial will last for a month with maximum bonding capacity of $250k worth of BEETS. Note that the amount of BEETS used is quite small compared to our current monthly farming emission.\n\nUsers will be able to acquire BEETS at a discount by vesting their A Late Quartet liquidity tokens over a 5-days vesting period. Bond discount is determined by the market.\n\nAt the end of the vesting period, the DAO treasury would own the liquidity tokens.\n\nOlympus Pro takes 3.3% fee on the liquidity token used for bonding.\nWe would launch another vote prior to the trial ending to see if the community decides to extend and / or modify.\n\nAbout Olympus Pro:\nOlympus Pro is the new industry-standard platform to help protocols acquire their own liquidity. Protocols no longer need to pay out high incentives to rent liquidity, while also guaranteeing the permanence of liquidity to facilitate transactions.\n\nOlympus Pro solves these liquidity problems by providing bonds-as-a-service for a small fee. Instead of staking their LP (liquidity provider) tokens for farming rewards, users can exchange their LP tokens for the protocol’s governance tokens at a discounted rate. This is done through a process called Bonding.\n\nYou can learn more about it here :\nWebsite : https://www.olympusdao.finance/pro\nDoc : https://docs.olympusdao.finance/main/\nTwitter : https://twitter.com/OlympusDAO\nDiscord : https://discord.com/invite/6QjjtUcfM4\nMedium : https://olympusdao.medium.com/",

      "title": "Proposal for Updated Protocol Fee Distribution",
      "content": "After long discussions in the governance chat on Discord, an updated strategy has emerged for how we as a community should manage distribution of protocol fees. The new strategy would be as follows:\n\n- 50% of protocol fees will be re-invested into LP'ing on Beethoven-X, controlled by the DAO treasury.\n- 30% will be used to buy BEETS off the market and distribute to liquidity providers.\n- 18% goes to the team to cover salaries and infrastructure costs\n- 2% will continue to go to The Beethoven Climate Fund\n\n#### Why the change:\nYou, dear Ludwigs, have made great points that our current fee distribution needs such changes for the following benefits:\n\n- Holding BEETS becomes a claim on a yield generating treasury, which is an improved value proposition.\n- The treasury will become a very large LP as time goes on which will act as a solid tailwind for future growth.\n- BEETS will grow a large diversified treasury generating a significant yield. With that we are able to distribute higher protocol fee dividends to stakers in the future.\n- Simultaneously, buying back BEETS and rewarding those who choose to lock their liquidity would benefit investors in the protocol in short terms as well as helping to stabilize the liquidity.\n\nWe believe that this proposal creates a balance for near term benefit and long term growth of Beethoven X, which would be crucial to the protocol and also its users.",
