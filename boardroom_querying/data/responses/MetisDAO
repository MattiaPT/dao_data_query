      "content": "### **Meme Factory + Sequencer Node + PFP-NFT (DN404) = Tokenized Community**\n\n![14c48e1a3cb898e9f5c223822af44003e686f974_2_690x230.jpg](ipfs://bafybeicx4vzzbmrokh65srzrnhdhyxsujoz5h6724wyhqvg3klowpmwzv4)\n\n### Introduction\n\nPUMPe is a community-driven meme factory on the Metis ecosystem, leveraging a shared Sequencer node through the DN404 token standard. Each DN404 token represents ownership in the ecosystem’s first community-owned Sequencer node and provides access to the PUMPe meme factory, enabling direct community participation in governance and value distribution. \n\n\n### Problem Statement\n\nMeme culture is driving significant TVL, trading volume, and network activity across various ecosystems. However, Metis lacks a dedicated platform for creators and traders to capitalize on this trend, missing opportunities for growth and engagement. A flagship platform is needed to anchor the meme economy on Metis.\n\n### Solution\n\nPUMPe addresses this gap by combining a meme factory with a community-owned Sequencer node. Using the DN404 token standard, PUMPe introduces new market dynamics, enabling trading, staking, and arbitrage opportunities between NFTs, tokens, and Metis value, enhancing both network activity and decentralization.\n\n### Value Proposition\n\n-   Rising NFT Floor Value: NFTs are pegged to the compounding rewards from the Sequencer Pool, with a set floor price based on Metis value.\n-   Tokenized Sequencer: The Sequencer node is tokenized, offering users a share of the rewards.\n-   Revenue Distribution: Meme factory platform fees are redistributed to NFT holders.\n-   Airdrops: NFT holders and pool contributors receive airdrops of new meme launches.\n\n> This proposal promotes governance participation, revenue sharing, and network decentralization while capitalizing on the current meme trend to drive TVL and user engagement.\n\n### Key Uniqueness Factors\n\n-   Dual Asset Standard (DN404): Combines ERC20 and ERC721 standards, creating dynamic trading between NFTs and tokens.\n-   Sequencer Node Integration: Extends beyond a typical meme factory by incorporating Sequencer node mining and fee redistribution.\n-   Cultural & Economic Integration: PFP NFTs represent both Sequencer ownership and community identity, encouraging active participation.\n-   Game Theory Design: Incorporates staking incentives, DEX liquidity rewards, and dynamic revenue-sharing models to drive engagement.\n-   Deflationary Mechanism: Re-stakes 50% of Sequencer rewards, reducing token supply and supporting token value.\n\n### Benefits for Web3 Users\n\n-   Ownership & Governance: DN404 token holders gain ownership of both the meme factory and the Sequencer node, with governance rights and revenue-sharing.\n-   Market Opportunities: Arbitrage possibilities between NFT marketplaces and DEXs.\n-   Deflationary Rewards System: Re-staking Sequencer rewards increases the floor value of DN404 tokens.\n-   DeFi Opportunities: Opens new use cases for lending and prediction markets leveraging PUMPe's interest-bearing nature.\n-   Meme Economy Participation: Enables users to capitalize on the meme super-cycle through NFT and token trading on Metis.\n\n### Benefits for the Metis Ecosystem\n\n-   Increases TVL & Trading Volume: Liquidity deployment on DEXs with each launch boosts volume and fees.\n-   Attracts Creators & Traders: Establishes Metis as a hub for meme traders, NFT enthusiasts, and creators.\n-   Facilitates New DApps: Drives new innovations like lending protocols and prediction markets.\n-   Sustainable Activity: Uses game theory to incentivize staking and liquidity provisioning.\n-   Strengthens Token Economy: Deflationary mechanics support Metis token value and long-term sustainability.\n\n### Roadmap\n\n-   Sep 15 - Oct 15: DN404 smart contract development\n-   Oct 21: Socials & website launch\n-   Oct 22: CEG application\n-   Oct 21 - 22: Preheat phase on social media\n-   Oct 23: Limited sale/donation announcement\n-   Oct 23 - Ongoing: Social awareness campaign\n-   Oct 15 - Ongoing: Platform smart contract development\n-   Oct 20 - Nov 5: Backend development\n-   Oct 25 - Nov 10: Frontend development\n-   Nov 1 - 5: DEX integration\n-   Nov 15: Mainnet launch (V1)\n\nConclusion\n\nPUMPe combines meme culture, DeFi mechanics, sequencer usage, and governance to create a community center for launches on Metis. The community tokenization model aims to be inclusive, innovative and one of the most exciting approaches for network growth.\n\nThe PUMPe revolution is happening on METIS.

      "title": "Ecosystem Proposal: Methera",
      "content": "### Project Name: Methera\n\n### Category: Cross-Chain LSD Protocol\n\n# Overview\n\nMethera is a cross-chain Liquid Staking Derivative (LSD) protocol specifically designed for METIS.\\\nOur goal is to enhance the utility of the METIS token by providing holders the opportunity and ability to use a liquid variant (yMETIS) of their METIS tokens across other blockchains without having to sacrifice their staking positions natively on Metis Andromeda. yMETIS is a solution that allows METIS holders enjoy earning staking rewards on the Metis Andromeda Network while still participating in defi activities across other Networks and protocols.\n\n## Benefits\n\nWith Methera, METIS holders can maximize their earning potential without having to lock their assets entirely, Methera offers:\n\n### Increased utility:\nMethera introduces a liquid derivative (yMETIS), allowing METIS holders to use their tokens in DeFi protocols, liquidity pools, and other ecosystems while still earning staking rewards.\\\nWhen staking with Methera, users receive yMETIS tokens on a 1:1 basis representing their staked METIS.\n\n### Multichain Integration:\nMethera's cross-chain functionality expands the METIS token's use cases beyond Metis Andromeda, boosting its visibility and adoption across multiple blockchain networks. This means new defi strategies and exciting opportunities for stakers on Metis Andromeda.\n\n### Higher Demand and Liquidity:\nAs yMETIS becomes widely accepted and used in DeFi platforms across chains, the demand for METIS increases, contributing to a higher liquidity, and seamless transfers between chains.\n\n#### Enhanced Staking Options:\nMethera empowers METIS holders by providing flexible staking options, allowing users to participate in staking and DeFi simultaneously, which is crucial for active DeFi participants who seek optimized yields.\n\n### Risk Mitigation:\nUsers can tap into liquidity and DeFi strategies with their staked assets, broadening their opportunities and minimizing the risks tied to staking on a single chain.\n\n3.  Opportunities for Growth and Development in the Metis Ecosystem\n\nMethera's success will play a key role in driving the growth of the Metis ecosystem, encouraging network expansion and adoption in the following ways:\n\n### Ecosystem Expansion:\nAs Methera integrates with other chains and dApps, it will drive developers and users to explore the Metis ecosystem, thereby increasing the number of projects building on Metis.\n\n### Incentivizing New Protocols:\nMethera will actively partner with other Metis-based protocols, providing them with defi strategies using yMETIS. This incentivizes the development and increase interaction with yield farms, lending platforms, and other DeFi services on Metis Andromeda, enriching the ecosystem.\\\nWith Methera's strategies, the Metis Andromeda network will become a competitive option for projects seeking to build cross-chain solutions.\n\n### Increased Holding Incentives:\nAs Methera enhances the utility and value proposition of staking METIS, more users will be incentivized to hold and stake the token, creating a positive cycle of demand and network participation.\n\n# Roadmap\n\n![](https://ceg.vote/uploads/default/original/2X/9/949c69d081a684c607a69c75c98e9e52ab3fd24d.png)[methera.gitbook.io](https://methera.gitbook.io/methera-docs/whitepaper/project-roadmap)\n\n![](https://ceg.vote/uploads/default/optimized/2X/2/2f1bfb5aa8f13799f5a74caf06de09eb042451b3_2_690x362.png)\n\n### [Project Roadmap | Methera Docs 2](https://methera.gitbook.io/methera-docs/whitepaper/project-roadmap)\n\nMethera aims to be a key player in the Metis ecosystem, fostering growth, enhancing the utility of METIS, and encouraging collaboration across different chains.

It is the only launchpad focused exclusively on advancing Regenerative Finance (ReFi) within the Web3 ecosystem.\n\nStartups from Metis, backed by CVP, the Howey Test, and our ReFi Starter NFT Pass screening process, can run fundraising campaigns through our platform. We collaborate with partners across 45 cities worldwide to promote projects and drive global adoption. Our launchpad delivers meaningful impact to the entire blockchain space.\n\nOur goal is to transform every token-based startup into a Regenerative World Asset.

While Web3 and crypto often face mixed perceptions, we aim to showcase them as engines of real-world change and value.\n\nOur vision is to create a collaborative hub where projects build a token economy that drives positive transaction volumes, accelerating Web3 adoption in meaningful ways.\n\n### Under Development:\n- Initial DEX Offerings (IDO)\n- Initial Locked Liquidity Offerings (ILLO)\n- Initial Concentrated Liquidity Offerings (ICLO)\n- Public Goods Donation Campaigns\n- Initial Public Goods Offerings (IPGO)\n- APY/Farming Campaigns\n- Initial Impact NFT Offerings (INO)\n- Initial RWA Offerings (IRWAO)\n- Tokenization of Real-World Assets Campaigns\n- Donation Campaigns for Bootstrap Builders on Metis \n![bc24d0f3d7ff164b708f2ef29a1165fc96ed58ac_2_690x388.jpg](ipfs://bafybeiaw7wqivkf5mbvhxblmuwn6u7sls2jr4rja2n4ifvgbwy7xvimkt4)\n    \n## Benefits for Users\nReFi Starter provides access to a pipeline of highly vetted, token-based startups. Our priority is to onboard strong teams with:\n- Solid long-term token utility and active token economy\n- Reliable proof of concept\n- Experienced technologists\n- Balanced tokenomics\n- Deep knowledge of token performance\n\nMany startups may not fully understand the responsibilities and challenges of launching a coin or token on the trading market. We ensure they are well-prepared, helping them minimize risks and build sustainable value.\n\nOur rigorous screening process verifies the identity, location, and personal information of all team members and projects deploying tokens. To further enhance security, we require each project to launch with a Locked Liquidity Pool, ensuring liquidity and stability.\n\nFor builders, we offer full support, whether they want to launch their own token or join an existing project that aligns with their expertise and values. Our platform fosters responsible growth and long-term token performance.\n\n## Benefits for Metis Ecosystem\n- Reliable Fundraising Launchpad: Conduct fundraisers with Safe Global Escrow, ensuring secure transactions.\n- Highly Vetted Projects: Access a pipeline of thoroughly screened, fully KYC-verified projects ready for market launch.\n- Stablecoin Bridge: Seamlessly bring stablecoins from other L2s into the Metis ecosystem.\n- Collaboration Hub: A dynamic cluster to find teams, form partnerships, assemble projects, contribute, and earn rewards.\n- Startup Marketplace: A platform to discover and engage with innovative startups.\n- RWA Framework with CCIP: Enable the tokenization and management of Real-World Assets (RWAs) with secure cross-chain interoperability.\n- Project Database: A comprehensive repository of entrepreneurs, hackathon builders, and projects in development.\n- Token Offering Aggregator: Integrate and aggregate token offerings from other chains into Metis, expanding opportunities for participants.\n\n## Security/Audits\n\nOur smart contracts are thoroughly tested on the testnet and will only be deployed after receiving at least two independent cybersecurity audit reports from reputable CySec firms.\n\nThis rigorous standard applies to all token startups launching through ReFi Starter, ensuring the highest level of security. Our top priority is to eliminate 100% slippage, prevent drains, and safeguard against hacks and exploits, delivering a secure experience for all users and investors.\n\nRoadmap\n\n-   Dashboard (Frontend):\n-   Create profiles\n-   Register projects\n-   Apply as a whitelisted backer\n-   Register Real-World Assets (RWA)\n-   Aggregate IDO pipelines from partner sources\n-   KYC Implementation:\n-   For both token buyers and project owners\n-   Launch Calendar:\n-   Track upcoming project launches and events\n-   Staking Mechanism:\n-   Earn rewards through token staking\n-   Token Minter Smart Contract:\n-   Includes split parameters for flexible minting\n-   Claim/Vesting Mechanism:\n-   Smart contract to manage token claims and vesting schedules\n-   Liquidity Aggregation:\n-   Integrate existing DEXs and liquidity pools on Metis\n-   NFT Smart Contract:\n-   Enable creation and management of NFTs\n-   DAO Framework:\n-   Governance voting through smart contracts\n-   ReFi Starter Token Launch:\n-   Introduce the native token for platform use and governance\n\n## Summary\n\nReFi Starter is the first Web3 launchpad focused on Regenerative Finance (ReFi), combining venture funding, climate tech, and blockchain.

      "title": "Ecosystem Proposal: Winks.fun (Twitter micro-apps) on Metis",
      "content": "> ### The Real Magic Begins When the World Uses Web3 Without Knowing They Are Using Web3!\n\n## Introducing Winks.fun: \n\nWinks are like Solana Blinks, but for EVM chains, such as Metis. Winks are Twitter-native micro-apps for on-chain actions such as such as swap, bridge, mint, burn, transfer, approve, vote, stake, bet, etc. can occur within Twitter's native web interface. No middleware needed. Coming soon to Discord and Telegram, too.\n\n> ### Winks = Web3 + Links\n\n## Value Proposition:\n\n*Why Winks.fun:*\n\n-   Traditional online actions have been locked away in apps or complex interfaces, creating app fatigue.\n-   With Winks.fun, Winks (micro-apps) can open up anywhere on the internet --- no app required.\n\n*Why Twitter:*\n\n-   Up to 60% of active unique crypto users also use Twitter, which itself has an active user base of over 350 million users.\n-   This makes Twitter a unique platform capable of being the primary distribution channel for on-chain web3 actions.\n\n### Uniqueness Factors:\n\n-   Seamless integration: Perform on-chain actions directly within Twitter's interface without the need for multiple apps or extensions.\n-   Enhanced user experience: Consolidate your Web3 interactions and reduce app fatigue with our unified platform.\n-   Anti-bot measures: Leverage Twitter's stringent anti-bot measures to ensure genuine user engagement.\n-   Multi-platform support: Future-proof your interactions with upcoming support for Discord and Telegram.\n\n### Benefits of Winks.fun for Web3 Users:\n\n-   Let's bring crypto to the people - end-to-end web3 interactions within Twitter, with any wallet.\n-   Most Web3 offerings are built for Web3 folks - so they have low adoption!\n-   Winks allows users to access Web3 dApps from within the Web2 apps they already use, such as Twitter.\n-   For users, Winks needs no additional integration, no browser plugin, no download, no popup, no new tab, no new window, and no loss of context.\n\n### Benefits of Winks.fun for the Metis Ecosystem:\n\n-   Winks will empower protocols on Metis to meet their users where they are - Crypto Twitter!\n-   DeFi, gameFi, social, prediction and consumer dapps on Metis could use Winks to exponentiate on-chain activity, witnessing improved conversions and faster user journey completion.\n-   The consumer crypto funnel of acquisition → activation → engagement → retention → monetization can be completed within Twitter via Winks.\n-   First-mover advantage for protocols on Metis, given the opportunity to deploy their specific Winks.\n\n### Roadmap:\n\n-   Winks are live on Twitter! Coming soon on Discord and Telegram.\n-   Wink-specific analytics dashboards underway.\n-   Dynamic Winks (user-personalized) underway.\n\n> ### To summarize, Winks by Winks.fun are the simplest way for protocols on Metis to deploy micro-apps on Twitter, and see massive surge in their on-chain activity.\n\n### Official Links:\n*Website:* [https://www.winks.fun](https://www.winks.fun/)\n*Twitter/X:* [x.com](https://x.com/winksdotfun)\n*Telegram: Contact* @winksdotfun",

      "title": "Ecosystem Proposal: Zapper - Onchain Explorer & DeFi Dashboard",
      "content": "# Metis x Zapper - Dashboard & Explorer proposal\n## Introduction:\nZapper provides support for Metis which offers on-chain users a DeFi dashboard feature for their wallets, NFT tracking and valuation, chain activity feed & a blockchain explorer which makes on-chain events human readable. All of this, available on web & mobile. **Exploring Metis will be more fun with Zapper!**\n\n## Benefits for users… \n\n**Why Zapper?:** At Zapper our mission is to make blockchains accessible and readable for everyone. We do so by providing our community with a long list of features that range from on-chain activity trends to the possibility of grouping multiple wallets under a bundle whatever chain those wallets may be on. These tools bring the on-chain user’s experience to the next level!\n\nBuilders will also benefit from Zapper supporting Metis chain! With 21 API endpoints, we offer a wide coverage and accessibility of data.\n\n### Did you know?\n\n- Zapper receives over 1.3M visits per month. Which would bring many new eyes to the Metis ecosystem!\n- Since supporting a new network in August 2023 (Base) we have received over 1.7M USD$ volume of swaps on Zapper. We help generate activity on the networks we support.\n\n# Detailed Proposal:\n\nIn order to provide the Metis community with the missing tools, and enhance the on-chain experience of all users, Zapper proposes to support Metis with its full list of available features.\n- **Portfolio Dashboard:** On its profile, a user can track a lot of important information such as their list of assets and up-to-date valuation, list of claimable rewards, list of open positions on different apps and much more. \n![64dcd533e4c6849b8f0219512261b5f443cf4a7c_2_624x271.png](ipfs://bafkreif3vcmn7i7za42slhtyzykofpkjkflh6zu3xnb6xuh3t23imu5qsm)\n\n- **NFTs valuation:** Through this portfolio feature, it is also possible for someone to track their NFT collection and estimated value for each piece of the collection. Estimated value is calculated by Zapper by accounting for the trait rarity of the NFT and recent sales to better estimate the real value of the NFT, not simply accounting for floor price.\n![c340c2e4ded22e510bb99c6e1930f01f2a78545a_2_623x275.png](ipfs://bafybeid36oibkgczc6laot7u6qv3kftvjlokssfyjnwyqomjdxf33c3uou)\n\n- **Activity Feed & Trends:** Zapper’s activity feed allows anyone to quickly see what is currently happening on-chain. The activity feed can be customized by chain, by category (swaps, NFT mints, NFT sales) and users can also track specific accounts on their feed. \n![c623fe8581cc2de98b3d984838a90462ff717ec0_2_624x353.jpg](ipfs://bafybeifxh3fc3bb7zarxk66dbvq5p3xdjtmvpqzsdgv5tho27yvhxsmb5q)\n\n- **Human-readable Events:** Zapper’s blockchain explorer is all about making the blockchain readable and accessible to everyone, whatever their technical background may be. Users can submit human readable interpretations of on-chain events, and Zapper will then render those interpretations to all users. \n![bea23db6fa495451ed4b18638a4d76101851ee78_2_624x171.png](ipfs://bafybeiddaf64fb2cwgk473mia5g3bmz6ovpc63hvablvqnb52be7uanux4)\n    \n- **Mobile apps:** Zapper offers mobile apps that are available both on iOS and Android. These mobile apps offer Zapper’s full list of features so that users can have the same experience on mobile or web. \n![9bd9fd5b8c2ba611049bc00294819f3e16b44c3b_2_624x393.png](ipfs://bafybeid6w47jkl3fznqv354mdh2bajbxj4sjl4qshstykyiv6gsojv3rbq)\n\n- **Social:** A Zapper user can easily follow friends and other wallets of interest. They can also be followed by other on-chain members.\n\n- **Data available via Zapper API suite:** Zapper offers access to 3rd parties to the valuations we output via our API. This access is granted per-request. Additionally, Zapper Protocol will be offering a GraphQL API for developers to access interpreted data. This API will be the primary way for developers to access onchain data from Zapper Protocol. Notable perks of this solution includes that your data will be returned in our GraphQL API, which will then be available for apps to build on. Users will also be able to contribute to this by interpreting events, contract positions, tokens and more. And these users can be rewarded for their efforts.\n\n- **Wallet Bundles:** Bundles allow users to easily track multiple wallets in a single feed and location. Users can track wallets across different chains easily by simply adding them to a bundle. \n![7915867067b2440a27ea008347766ba384804faf_2_624x291.png](ipfs://bafybeighyqe7c2jfmt6vgq2shxkpvh54qav737jrlxvq5fi6ih5aihtwrq)\n\n- **Swap & Bridge:** Zapper’s bridge feature allows users to easily bridge to and from different chains directly from the Zapper website. Same goes for the ability to swap from one token to another on Zapper .\n\n- **User notifications:** With Zapper, a user can customize notifications to be alerted of specific on-chain events. This feature is also available on mobile apps.\n\n-  **Accessibility:** In order to provide the best experience for all users, Zapper offers many options for a user to customize their experience on Zapper. For example, a user can choose from 20 different base currencies, they can choose from 16 different languages, as well as choosing between a light and a dark version of the website.\n\n- **User support:** In addition to the features made available, Zapper will also offer full user support. User support is made available through multiple channels including Discord, ZenDesk, Telegram & X (Twitter).\n\n## Budget & Timeline\nZapper is asking for a grant of 33,750$ which will cover the infrastructure cost of backfilling all of Metis blockchain history back to the first block to offer users price history for tokens and NFTs.\nThis grant will also cover the expected infrastructure cost of supporting Metis for a full year.\n\nOnce the proposal is approved, Zapper expects to have Metis fully integrated and supported within 4 weeks.\n\n### Comments & Questions\nZapper is happy to present this proposal for review and comments to the Metis community. All feedback on this proposal is welcomed.\n\n### Official Links\nWebsite: <https://zapper.xyz/>\n\nTwitter: [x.com](https://x.com/zapper_fi)\n\nDiscord: <https://zapper.xyz/discord>\n\nLink3: [zapper | Link3.to](https://link3.to/zapper)",

      "title": "Ecosystem Proposal: Yeti-Apes",
      "content": "## Introduction\n\nYeti-Apes is a pioneering web3 initiative that brings together a global community of blockchain enthusiasts to drive the development of innovative, community-centric products.\\\nAt the heart of Yeti-Apes is a unique dual-token economy designed to empower participants, encourage decentralized governance, and ensure sustainable growth. Through this model, community members can actively participate in the decision-making process, stake tokens to earn rewards, and share in the revenue generated by Yeti-Apes dApps. By aligning the interests of users and creators, Yeti-Apes not only boost user engagement but also builds a strong, self-sustaining ecosystem that continually evolves with its community's needs.\n\n## Value Proposition\n\n-   **Onboarding and User Adoption:** * The first priority is to focus on educating new users and creators about the Metis ecosystem and the Yeti-Apes platform. By providing comprehensive user guides, tutorials, and educational content, the project can ensure that users have the knowledge and tools needed to successfully navigate and contribute to the ecosystem through our first dApp - [The NFT Hub](https://thenfthub.xyz/) . Yeti-Apes plans to onboard new users to the Metis ecosystem with a seamless NFT marketplace and launch platform while providing existing communities with collaboration and interaction tools, enhancing user experience and ecosystem integration.\n-   **Dual-Token Model:** * The next priority is to implement the dual-token system, which empowers the community by offering decentralized governance. Through this model, community members can actively participate in the decision-making process, stake tokens to earn rewards, and **share in the revenue generated by Yeti-Apes dApps,** supporting long-term engagement and alignment with the project's goals.\n-   **Building Decentralized Products with Revenue Sharing:** Lastly, the focus shifts to developing decentralized products, such as [the NFT Hub](https://thenfthub.xyz/), Social Identity Platform and NFT Marketplace, with built-in **revenue-sharing mechanisms.** These products will not only provide users with valuable tools but also ensure that the community benefits from the ecosystem's success, creating a sustainable and collaborative environment.\n\n## Uniqueness Factor\n\nYeti-Apes distinguishes itself with its dual-token governance and utility model. Unlike many projects that struggle to decentralize governance, our model hands the reins to the community. $YOINTS holders have voting rights, while $YAPES functions as a utility token, ensuring a thriving internal economy.\\\n\nAdditionally, our NFT Hub stands out as a platform that integrates analytics, educational content, marketplace functions, and creator tools, all within a single ecosystem. On-chain gaming further amplifies engagement, providing an immersive, interactive experience for users, and reinforcing long-term involvement in the project.\n\n## Roadmap\nThe Yeti-Apes roadmap is a product development plan driven by community decisions, outlining the ecosystem's future developments through four main phases\n\n1.  *Initiation:* Launch the dual-token model and the first dApp, The NFT Hub, for revenue sharing and decentralized governance. Engage the community with games, incentives, and staking pools to build liquidity and ownership.\n2.  *Growth:* Develop a native NFT marketplace on Metis L2 followed by launching the new Yeti-Apes NFT collection and a Social Identity platform. Attract developers with grants for open-source projects and implement governance for the first minigames.\n3.  *Expansion:* Scale the ecosystem with resources for a Metis sequencer node and a one-click LST product. Create multi-chain liquidity for the dual-token model and run campaigns to support developers and creators.\n4.  *Sustainability:* Focus on product launches in Yeti-Apes ecosystem that improve revenue distribution and further decentralize governance for long-term growth and community-driven decisions.\n\n## Summary\nYeti-Apes is a community-driven ecosystem designed to foster innovation, collaboration, and sustainable growth. By leveraging our unique dual-token model and empowering our community with decentralized governance, we create a platform where every individual has the opportunity to shape the project's future. Through comprehensive onboarding, educational content, and the development of decentralized products, Yeti-Apes is positioned to not only drive user adoption but also ensure long-term value creation for all participants. Together, we can build a thriving, self-sustaining ecosystem where growth is powered by community engagement and shared success.\n\n### Official Links:\n[Website](https://www.yetiapes.xyz/)\n[Yeti-Apes X Account](https://x.com/YetiApes)\n[Whitepaper](https://yeti-apes.gitbook.io/yeti-apes-whitepaper/)\n\n**Communities**: https://linktr.ee/yetiapes",

      "title": "Ecosystem Proposal: WeaveVM",
      "content": "![image (1)](https://ceg.vote/uploads/default/optimized/2X/6/6cbc1a3c9d4e9a9343172f0e23f769210fce3abe_2_690x247.png)\n\n## Introduction\n\nWeaveVM is a hyper scalable storage and data availability (DA) network designed to solve the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) storage bottleneck and address the inefficiencies of slow, expensive temporary DA. As a high-performance parallel EVM network, WeaveVM is engineered to maximise scalability and transparency for Layer 1 (L1) and Layer 2 (L2) blockchains, as well as data-intensive decentralised applications (dApps). Key performance metrics include a capacity of 1 gigagas per second, 47,000 transactions per second (TPS), parallel execution, and a throughput of over 125MB/s.\n\nWeaveVM offloads storage to Arweave, enabling any chain to integrate a permanent storage layer powered by a hyper scalable network of EVM nodes with MegaETH-grade throughput.\n\n## About the Team\n\nWeaveVM is developed by Decent Land Labs, a project founded in 2019 with the mission of making Arweave storage accessible to all blockchain infrastructures. The team consists of members with experience at leading organisations, including Poloniex, Community Labs, Forward Research, Supabase, and contributors to Paradigm's Reth core codebase.\n\nWebsite: [https://www.wvm.dev/](https://www.wvm.dev/)\\\nBlog: <https://blog.wvm.dev/>\\\nDocs: <https://docs.wvm.dev/>\n\n## Overview\n\nWeaveVM is addressing the challenges of data availability and storage scalability. We are seeking approval and co-marketing support from Metis to promote WeaveVM’s integration with Metis, focusing on its potential to enhance the Metis ecosystem via integration with the WeaveVM Archiver.\n\n## Accomplishments\n\n-   **Funding**: WeaveVM raised $3 million, supported by investors such as Longhash, LD Capital, Foresight Ventures, and Arweave.\n-   **EVM precompiles and data pipeline for permanent storage**: WeaveVM is unique in that it has native bidirectional communication with Arweave, a permanent storage chain. With WeaveVM, chains and dApps can read and write to Arweave from the smart contract layer and bypass the limitations of EVM storage.\n-   **Public testnet**: Testnet has launched, with the mainnet launch expected in early 2025. Additionally, we offer an ecosystem grant to support testnet builders and encourage innovation on our platform.\n\n## About WeaveVM Archiver\n\nThe WeaveVM Archiver is an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) archive pipeline specifically designed for EVM networks. It offers the simplest way to interface with WeaveVM's permanent data feature without rollup smart contract redeployments or sequencer changes.\n\nBy integrating the WeaveVM Archiver, developers can leverage WeaveVM's permanent data storage without changes to the core architecture.\n\nThe Archiver for Metis is currently live, and can be accessed here: <https://wvm-archiver.shuttleapp.rs/info>\n\nThe code for the archiver can be found here: [GitHub - weaveVM/wvm-archiver: https://wvm-archiver.shuttleapp.rs/](https://github.com/weaveVM/wvm-archiver)\n\n## Why WeaveVM Archiver\n\n1.  A straightforward interface to WeaveVM's permanent data feature, eliminating the need for disruptive smart contract redeployments or changes to sequencers.\n2.  Continue using Metis' current architecture for data settlement and DA, reducing the need for extensive codebase modifications while benefiting from enhanced data availability.\n3.  Data is permanently archived and accessible. WeaveVM acts as a permanent, incentivized archival node that can be used for new network participants as a checkpoint.\n\n## Proposal for Co-Marketing Collaboration\n\nTo maximise the impact of WeaveVM and its Archiver feature, we propose a co-marketing collaboration with Metis. This would involve:\n\n-   Announcements on Metis communication channels to introduce WeaveVM and the Archiver\n\n### Summary\n\nWeaveVM has deployed a permanent archiver for Metis data, acting as a decentralised archival node by pushing chain data to Arweave. This requires no changes in Metis architecture. WeaveVM is seeking a co-marketing collaboration with Metis to show how it can be used to ensure long-term storage of on-chain data, and how Metis' decentralisation has improved as a result. By partnering with Metis, we can together promote a platform that aligns with the values of decentralisation, scalability, and cost-effectiveness, ultimately benefiting developers and users across the ecosystem.",

      "title": "Ecosystem Proposal - Shards App, Guild building and monetization tool for GameFi",
      "content": "## Introduction\nShards is a free-to-use SDK built for game studios that boosts in-game engagement and revenue by allowing players to create, fractionalize and trade in-game guilds. Shards is fully compatible with Metis Blockchain and ready to be integrated into any game on Metis Blockchain.\n\n## Value Proposition\nBased on our analyses and research we have discovered that nearly 80% of games lose their TVL and active users within the first 4 months of the game’s release, in many cases the slope goes down to 90% within the first 6 months.\n\nDespite being well funded by backers, venture capitalists, and receiving blockchain foundation grants, Game Studios struggle to find the best economically efficient strategy to retain in-game users.\n\nNFT sales, token launches, airdrops do not seem to be an ideal solution, and users expectations are always beyond the reach of game’s deliveries. In a bear or calm market, these strategies do not work. Often play-to-earn, users have to purchase expensive gear, lands, equipment and other in-game assets. Game studios on the other hand gravitate towards return on their investment and mainly focus on short-term cash incomes.\n\n## Uniqueness Factor\nWe have recognized that Friend.tech was one of the few blockchain projects not only to sustain the bear market but generate a revenue of $30M+ being a social platform. We have also examined the expanding integration of guilds in all major Web2 games and introduction of social platforms into Web3. Pooling these two engines, we have come up with an idea of providing guild building capabilities and allowing to fractionalize guilds and trade them.\n\nShards SDK will allow game studios to be able to implement guild building and allow users to monetise their guild and start earning while progressing in the game.\n\n## Benefits for Users\nWe cover all participants of the ecosystem, players, non-players, game studios, and the blockchain foundation.\n\nAsides from the increasing engagement, retention and spending in the app, studios actually generate revenue on these fractions. Below please find the benefits of each participant. The mechanism implies a 10% trading fee for every fractions traded, which is then distributed among the participants.\n\n- Game studio - receives a 3-4% of the total trading fee\n- Guild - receives 5% of the total trading fee (whenever their fractions are traded)\n- Shards - receives 1% of the total trading fee\n- Metis - have an option to receive 1% of the total trading fee as a revenue or for Blockchain’s prize pool and other incentives.\n\n## Benefits for Metis\nMetis’s gaming ecosystem will have a new mechanism to power up their guild system with additional benefits, such as:\n\n- **Motivated and engaged user-base** who love to compete against other players.\n- **Auxiliary liquidity source**, with the cash inflow coming from players, spectators, and frequent traders of Shards App, increasing the game’s TVL.\n- **Auxiliary monetization source**, where the studio earns from the fee generated by ecosystem participants as they create, buy and sell seats or fractions.\n- **Attract major Gaming Guilds**, who are already part of the Shards Tech ecosystem and are open to discover and explore new projects and markets.\n\n## Summary\nGaming niche is still uncovered and the potential of blockchain gaming is yet to be fully revealed, hence we see an immense potential in our partnership. Shards would like to be part of Metis Blockchain’s ecosystem and participate in scaling the gaming ecosystem of Metis bringing a sustainable TVL and growing user engagement.\n\n## Links\nWebsite [https://shards.tech/](https://shards.tech/)\nTrading Platform [https://app.shards.tech/](https://app.shards.tech/)\nWhitepaper [https://whitepaper.shards.tech/](https://whitepaper.shards.tech/)\nTwitter [x.com](https://twitter.com/shardsofficial)\n[YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@Shards_Official)",

      "content": "![657eb9c63b7f11498b5072827a072af139dfe402.png](ipfs://bafkreiea6zkebd5pzjiobjnhohjtxpzil2nz3knhvtr2u2r7laz2gtx4hy)\n\n## Introduction\n\nMerkl is an innovative platform designed to optimize and streamline liquidity mining in the DeFi space. By leveraging advanced off-chain data analysis and computing on-chain actions, Merkl enables efficient and accurate reward allocations for various DeFi activities such as providing liquidity in liquidity pools, and in lending protocols.\n\nMerkl’s building blocks are its campaigns. Campaigns make it incredibly simple for users to farm and earn competitive returns, and at the same time enable protocols to distribute incentives simply, easily and without operational hassles.\n\n### Our Mission\nOur mission is to create a seamless and efficient reward distribution system that maximizes the benefits for both users and incentive providers in the DeFi ecosystem. We aim to provide a transparent, reliable, and user-friendly platform that drives engagement and growth in DeFi.\n\n\n## Merkl features\n### For DeFi Users\n- **Competitive APRs:** With over $33M distributed, Merkl stands as an all-in-one incentivization hub offering attractive returns.\n- **No Staking Required** : You don’t need to stake any assets to earn rewards. Simply participate in the eligible activities and start earning.\n- **Gas Optimization** : Merkl’s system allows users to claim all their rewards in a single transaction, minimizing gas fees and simplifying the process.\n\n### For Protocols\n- **Easy and simple to start incentivizing** : In less than 5 minutes, anyone from your team can create a campaign.\n- **Flexibility** : Customize campaigns to suit your specific needs and goals, providing the flexibility to incentivize various behaviors and actions.\n  - **Efficient Liquidity Incentives** : Merkl enables protocols to incentivize liquidity more efficiently across various pools, including both V2 and concentrated liquidity (V3) pools, as well as lending protocols or yield aggregators\n  - **Token Snapshots** : Easily take snapshots to reward users based on their holdings at a specific point in time.\n  - **Airdrops:** Distribute tokens or rewards seamlessly to a broad user base using Merkl’s airdrop functionality.\n  - **Built-in reporting:** View in real time which users got rewarded by your campaigns and track how much of the rewards were claimed\n  - **Easy integration:** Integrate Merkl data into your app effortlessly with the fully maintained Merkl API by Angle Labs. However, you don’t have to integrate it if you don’t want to; the Merkl App will show your users everything they need, including the ability to claim their tokens directly from there.\n\n## Merkl’s Roadmap\nThe roadmap is designed to support as many Metis protocols as possible and provide new features for existing ones\n\n1. **Grant** : Merkl will apply for the grant program to enable the team to launch Merkl on Metis and support protocols from day 1.\n2. **Integration of Hercules DEX and Gamma:** Merkl will start tracking Hercules pools and Gamma vaults to support them once it launches\n3. **Public Launch**: Protocols will be able to create incentives campaigns on Merkl and users will begin earning rewards\n4. **Continuous Integration of new protocols:** Our goal is to help any Metis protocol to grow their TVL through incentives. Any protocol who is interested is welcome to reach out on our discord or reply on this proposal!\n5. **Continuous feature additions** : We’re working hard to provide new features for protocols using Merkl for liquidity mining. For example we’ll be releasing a new “bridge” feature in partnership with Jumper to enable protocols to only incentivize liquidity which has been bridged to the chain within a given timeframe.\n\n## Audits\nMerkl smart contracts have been audited by Code4rena. Find the audit report [here.](https://code4rena.com/reports/2023-06-angle)\n\n## Merkl’s Team\nWith over 5 years of experience in defi, our core team comprises 3 backend developers, a frontend developer, a solidity developer, a designer and a business developer. The Merkl team also works closely with the rest of the Angle Labs team.\n\nAs a matter of fact, Merkl started as an internal tool for Angle Labs to incentivize conctrated liquidity pools with EURA (previously named agEUR).\n\n## Conclusion\nIn short, Merkl is set to enable any protocols on Metis to grow their TVL through incentives and provide a great farming experience for Metis users, no staking needed!\n\n## Official Links: Website, Docs, Audits, Media, etc.\nApp: [https://app.merkl.xyz/](https://app.merkl.xyz/)\nTwitter: [https://twitter.com/merkl_xyz](https://twitter.com/merkl_xyz)\nTelegram: Telegram: Contact @baptistg",

      "title": "Ecosystem Proposal: Burve Protocol",
      "content": "## Introduction\nBurve Protocol is a next-generation automated market maker (AMM) and Launchpad, designed to revolutionize decentralized finance (DeFi) with innovative liquidity, launch, and lending solutions for various crypto use cases.\n\nOur platform offers fair token launches, unilateral liquidity management, and secure lending options, empowering users with advanced and customizable tools. Burve Protocol supports everything from meme tokens and in-game assets to sophisticated DeFi solutions, making DeFi accessible, fair, and transparent for all.\n\n## Our Vision\nOur vision is to power a global tokenized economy, democratizing access, liquidity, and lending to enable a more sustainable and inclusive web3 ecosystem.\n\n## Our Misson\nIn the rapidly evolving world of DeFi, Burve Protocol stands out as a beacon of innovation and inclusivity. We believe financial systems should be accessible, fair, and transparent, empowering individuals and communities worldwide.\n\nOur mission is to create a comprehensive platform where anyone, regardless of their financial background or technical expertise, can launch, manage, trade, and lend tokens with confidence and security.\n\nTo achieve this mission, we offer four key products: Launchpad, DEX, SDK, and Appchain.\n\n## Uniqueness Factor\n- **Original research base** : Burve introduces a consensus-driven AMM with advanced liquidity management and customizable bonding curves derived from original research.\n- **Advanced Liquidity Management** : Curb impermanent loss on traditional AMMs\nBurve utilizes our novel bonding curve research to manage liquidity dynamically, ensuring continuous availability and minimizing slippage. Burve solves Uniswap’s impermanent loss problem by enabling single token liquidity provision & introducing ‘liquidity clusters’ to allow for efficient transaction routing. Supports fully customizable fees for liquidity providers.\n- **Tailored Token Launches** : HODL + LOL\nWe offer launch modes that meet the demand of the crypto space for utility, digital and physical asset tokenization, and memecoins, among others. Our HODL launch mode allows for full customization of a token’s characteristics and associated curve, while the LOL launch mode is specially designed for meme token launches.\n- **No Potential Rug Pulls or Liquidity Risks**\nIn LP-based tokens, token issuers may have super admin access which can lead to rug pulls or liquidity pool withdrawals. Tokens on Burve are issued through the bonding curve and the supply is regulated solely through multi-audited bonding curve contract, no external token supply. This keeps anyone from rug-pulling or withdrawing the liquidity pool.\n- **Better Incentives for Memecoin Launches**\nCurrent memecoin launch incentives unsustainable, relying on insider trading or “buy low, sell high” strategies, causing constant fear of sell-offs by larger traders. Yet successful launchers on Burve that reach a $33K market cap can receive an instant 1000 USDT reward from Burve Treasury, referers can get 500 USDT, and early participants can enjoy up to 9x price increase. All participants not only have skin in the game but also will be rewarded for participation.\n\n\n## Benefits for Users:\n\n1. Simplified Onboarding\nLaunching a token typically demands extensive technical and financial expertise in smart contracts, liquidity pools, and understanding price and market cap. With Burve Protocol, the process is simplified to minimize effort. The LOL mode is ideal for memecoins, while the HODL mode is perfect for project and community tokens.\n\n2. Enhanced Token Trading Liquidity\nMany tokens face liquidity issues soon after launch, leading to unmatched buy/sell orders (common in order book AMMs) or one-sided liquidity shortages (common in LP AMMs requiring LP pairs). Burve uses bonding curve contracts to ensure that buy/sell orders can always be fulfilled. In both LOL and HODL modes, users don’t need to create liquidity pools or provide upfront capital, as all purchased tokens are backed by anchor tokens locked in the contract, preventing liquidity shortages.\n\n3. Reduced Rug Pull and Liquidity Risks\nLP-based tokens often risk rug pulls or liquidity pool withdrawals due to super admin access by token issuers. On Burve, tokens are issued through a bonding curve with supply regulated solely by a multi-audited bonding curve contract, eliminating external token supply. This mechanism prevents rug-pulling and liquidity pool withdrawals.\n\n4. Incentives for All Memecoin Paticipants\nCurrent memecoin launches often rely on unsustainable incentives like insider trading or “buy low, sell high” strategies, causing constant sell-off fears among larger traders. Successful launches on Burve reaching a $33K market cap earn the launcher an instant 1000 USDT reward from the Burve Treasury. Referrers receive 500 USDT, and early participants can see up to a 9x price increase. This system ensures all participants are invested and rewarded for their participation.\n\n5. Increased Discoverability\nNew token launches often go unnoticed due to limited discoverability methods like website checks or official announcements. Burve addresses this by integrating with Telegram to send instant notifications and automatically creating chat groups, enhancing discoverability for users.\n\n## Benefits for the Metis Ecosystem\n1. Simplified Token Creation\nBurve simplifies the creation of memecoins and governance tokens within the Metis community, making it accessible for anyone to launch their own tokens effortlessly.\n\n2. Fair and Secure Token Launches\nOur LP-less (liquidity pool-less), unruggable, fair, and instantly tradable token launches drive DeFi growth on Metis, acting as the fuel for the ecosystem’s expansion.\n\n3. Empowerment of Community Growth\n- For Small Projects: Burve provides an alternative funding method crucial for small projects to secure basic funding and grow their communities. Traditional ICOs and IDOs are often inaccessible due to size and volume requirements or initial liquidity needs, which Burve’s protocol effectively addresses.\n- For Larger Projects: Burve enhances token utility, tackling the ongoing challenge of aligning token prices with commercial success. Despite significant revenues in DeFi platforms, token prices often reflect a utility gap that Burve aims to close by providing better utility enhancement mechanisms.\n4. Enhancement of Metis Ecosystem and $METIS Utility\nBy facilitating diverse and secure token launches, Burve strengthens the overall Metis ecosystem and boosts the utility of $METIS, benefiting all stakeholders within the Metis network.\n\n## Roadmap\nOur initial version launched in March 2024. Moving forward in Q3 & beyond:\n\n- Support and Launch on Metis L2 and trading on Metis with bonding curves.\n- Add features like more anchor tokens for launches, fixed/adaptive max supply settings, etc.\n- Integrate other emerging and popular\n- Ongoing feature updates to enhance user experience\nEnhance project outreach via Metis Foundation support, Metis Ecosystem collaboration, KOL collaboration, and community education.\n\n## Security\n- Tokens on Burve are issued through the bonding curve and the supply is regulated solely through multi-audited bonding curve contract, no external token supply.\n- Audit Report by [Scalebit](https://1657845912-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F6RiyXfoC1Jp6FAmPYnBh%2Fuploads%2F7QuG8r0BP0MqPFZwq16Q%2FBurveProtocol_ScaleBit.pdf?alt=media&token=722a7805-2422-4348-9f80-7e470fd29630) and [Boesin](.\n\n### About Team\nOur team is led by experts with backgrounds in leading tech companies (Google, Meta, Tencent), Web3 organizations (Litentry, DIN, MakerDAO), and prestigious universities (UC Berkeley, University of Alberta, University of Stuttgart).

      "title": "Ecosystem Proposal - Shards App, Guild building and monetization tool for GameFi",
      "content": "## Introduction\nShards is a free-to-use SDK built for game studios that boosts in-game engagement and revenue by allowing players to create, fractionalize and trade in-game guilds. Shards is fully compatible with Metis Blockchain and ready to be integrated into any game on Metis Blockchain.\n\n## Value Proposition\nBased on our analyses and research we have discovered that nearly 80% of games lose their TVL and active users within the first 4 months of the game’s release, in many cases the slope goes down to 90% within the first 6 months.\n\nDespite being well funded by backers, venture capitalists, and receiving blockchain foundation grants, Game Studios struggle to find the best economically efficient strategy to retain in-game users.\n\nNFT sales, token launches, airdrops do not seem to be an ideal solution, and users expectations are always beyond the reach of game’s deliveries. In a bear or calm market, these strategies do not work. Often play-to-earn, users have to purchase expensive gear, lands, equipment and other in-game assets. Game studios on the other hand gravitate towards return on their investment and mainly focus on short-term cash incomes.\n\n## Uniqueness Factor\nWe have recognized that Friend.tech was one of the few blockchain projects not only to sustain the bear market but generate a revenue of $30M+ being a social platform. We have also examined the expanding integration of guilds in all major Web2 games and introduction of social platforms into Web3. Pooling these two engines, we have come up with an idea of providing guild building capabilities and allowing to fractionalize guilds and trade them.\n\nShards SDK will allow game studios to be able to implement guild building and allow users to monetise their guild and start earning while progressing in the game.\n\n## Benefits for Users\nWe cover all participants of the ecosystem, players, non-players, game studios, and the blockchain foundation.\n\nAsides from the increasing engagement, retention and spending in the app, studios actually generate revenue on these fractions. Below please find the benefits of each participant. The mechanism implies a 10% trading fee for every fractions traded, which is then distributed among the participants.\n\n- Game studio - receives a 3-4% of the total trading fee\n- Guild - receives 5% of the total trading fee (whenever their fractions are traded)\n- Shards - receives 1% of the total trading fee\n- Metis - have an option to receive 1% of the total trading fee as a revenue or for Blockchain’s prize pool and other incentives.\n\n## Benefits for Metis\nMetis’s gaming ecosystem will have a new mechanism to power up their guild system with additional benefits, such as:\n\n- **Motivated and engaged user-base** who love to compete against other players.\n- **Auxiliary liquidity source**, with the cash inflow coming from players, spectators, and frequent traders of Shards App, increasing the game’s TVL.\n- **Auxiliary monetization source**, where the studio earns from the fee generated by ecosystem participants as they create, buy and sell seats or fractions.\n- **Attract major Gaming Guilds**, who are already part of the Shards Tech ecosystem and are open to discover and explore new projects and markets.\n\n## Summary\nGaming niche is still uncovered and the potential of blockchain gaming is yet to be fully revealed, hence we see an immense potential in our partnership. Shards would like to be part of Metis Blockchain’s ecosystem and participate in scaling the gaming ecosystem of Metis bringing a sustainable TVL and growing user engagement.\n\n## Links\nWebsite [https://shards.tech/](https://shards.tech/)\nTrading Platform [https://app.shards.tech/](https://app.shards.tech/)\nWhitepaper [https://whitepaper.shards.tech/](https://whitepaper.shards.tech/)\nTwitter [x.com](https://twitter.com/shardsofficial)\n[YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@Shards_Official)",

      "title": "Ecosystem Proposal - VestaDAO: The Hub of Metis",
      "content": "# VestaDAO - The Hub of Metis\n \n![891bd0437cdfe522279cf9e4cc5314ae16495bd9_2_690x230.png](ipfs://bafybeibvibdltjug5ak7g2m4tkvvut4nyv2qaf5p7doycqx4mn3z4ozpiq)\n    \n\n\n## Introduction\n\n**VestaDAO’s goal is to establish itself as the hub of reliable information within the Metis ecosystem.** As more projects expand to Metis, the disconnect between consumer and dev grows. White papers and protocol docs read like a compendium of buzzwords rather than anything useful. VestaDAO is here to cut through the bullshit.\n\n---\n\nWe believe in the power of reliable, unbiased, information. Our aim is to leverage this power to not only foster community and trust, but also to return real tangible value to our token holders.\n\n**Think of Vesta as a Community Focussed Media Organization**\n\n### Problem\n  * The web 3 space (and Metis in particular) has a pandemic of shitty information with little to no oversight. How many times have you found yourself reading a project’s docs, only to realize 16 pages in you still have no idea what they do or why it might be a good thing?\n\n### Solution\n  * **Our solution is simple** - deep dives into new and existing projects with unbiased pros and cons - project by project we aim to demystify the ecosystem. We’ll build off of the interviews we’ve already conducted; but look to move away from hype focused and stick to straight facts.\n  * Starting immediately we will be releasing deep dives on projects within the metis ecosystem; these deep dive investigations will not only dive into the project itself, but also the founders, the tokenomics, and how they stack up against similar projects both within Metis and elsewhere in web3.\n\n## Value Proposition\n\nWe believe in the power of information. Our project’s success depends on becoming the hub of information within Metis - our aim is to become a force that cannot be ignored and to situate ourselves such that our stamp of approval can jumpstart any new project lucky enough to receive it.\n\nOnce we have established ourselves in such a way, we will leverage that influence with new projects who wish to receive a review from us before launch. This might be in the form of airdrops or TGE whitelists for instance.\n\n## Uniqueness Factor\n\nDespite the circumstances under which VestaDAO was formed, [see VestaDAO History](https://vdao-1.gitbook.io/vestadao-docs/vestadao-history), \nwe actually have a few things going for us:\n\n- **Impartial:** Not only is there a big gap in the market for consistent project reviews but there is even a bigger gap for coverage that is impartial. We feel it’s necessary for our success to remain without any bias when covering projects. We are bullish on Metis but won’t be holding back when researching to create a safer, more informed, and smarter community.\n\n- **Wide Open Market:** It is actually crazy that no-one has moved to fill the information void in the Metis ecosystem - with the Metis Ecosystem Development Funds (EDF) being distributed (~$15million to be distributed this year at current prices) we should begin to see a flood of new projects deploying in the near future. Given the full EDF amount allocated to project grants is almost $100million at current prices we should continue to see this in flow for several years. This creates an opportunity waiting to be taken.\n\n- **Network and Hustle:**  Our project lead, Cobi, has not been idle for a second since taking over. He earned a bunch of good faith for taking over the project and has been busy creating a network across the Metis ecosystem. This positions us perfectly to gain help and support in the early days of our plan, including privileged access to dev teams of existing projects.\n\n- **Great Community**: It’s a bit cliché to say - every community claims to be the best. Our community doesn’t just talk the talk - they believe in the future of this project. This is something that can’t be bought or faked - and something we’re not only extremely grateful for, but also a powerful tool we plan on utilizing.\n\n- **Low Market Cap**: What can we say? We’re currently a small fish - but we view this as a strength; much better growth potential and the opportunity for the most faithful of our supporters to own a significant chunk of our future.\n\n## Benefits for Users\n\n1. **Reliable Information:**\n\n  * VestaDAO aims to provide deep dives into new and existing projects with unbiased pros and cons, helping users to make informed decisions based on facts rather than hype.\n  * By cutting through the jargon and buzzwords commonly found in white papers and protocol docs, users can understand what a project truly does and its potential value.\n\n2. **Trust and Accountability:**\n\n  * Our deep dives will not only cover projects but also their founders and tokenomics, fostering transparency and trust within the community.\n  * Users will have access to interviews with project founders, providing clarity and firsthand information.\n\n3. **Community Engagement:**\n\n  * Users can participate in the community by sharing VestaDAO's deep dives and first impresions, challenging misinformation, and contributing to discussions, thereby becoming part of a trusted information hub.\n  * There are plans to gamify this engagement process, potentially rewarding active community members in the future.\n\n4. **Prioritized Alpha:**\n\n  * VestaDAO holders will get priority access to valuable insights and information uncovered during our deep dives into projects, offering them a competitive edge.\n\n5. **Exclusive Benefits:**\n\n  * Users will benefit from early access, discounts, and giveaways through partnerships like the one with Layer 2 LoFi Llamas, and potentially other partnerships in the future.\n\n6. **Governance Participation:**\n\n  * Users will have a say in important decisions, such as leadership elections, the fate of unclaimed tokens after migration, and any token holder will be able to submit a proposal and bring it to vote through VestaDAO's governance mechanism.\n\n## Benefits for Metis Ecosystem\n\n1. **Enhanced Transparency:**\n\n  * By providing clear, unbiased information, VestaDAO helps to demystify projects within the Metis ecosystem, making it easier for new and existing projects to gain trust and credibility.\n  * Encourages other projects to engage in honest marketing and communication.\n\n2. **Improved Project Quality:**\n\n  * With rigorous deep dives and transparency, VestaDAO sets a high standard for new projects, pushing them to meet these standards, thereby improving the overall quality of projects in the ecosystem.\n\n3. **Community Trust:**\n\n  * By acting as a champion for the average investor, VestaDAO aims to rebuild trust within the Metis ecosystem, which is crucial for its long-term success.\n  * Reduces the prevalence of bad actors and projects with no tangible value, fostering a healthier ecosystem.\n\n4. **Support for New Projects:**\n\n  * VestaDAO’s reviews and stamp of approval can help new projects gain visibility and credibility, potentially jumpstarting their success.\n  * Provides a platform for new projects to be scrutinized and understood, helping them to refine their offerings and align better with community expectations.\n\n5. **Informed Investment:**\n\n  * By offering thorough analyses and factual information, VestaDAO helps investors make better-informed decisions, which can lead to a more stable and prosperous ecosystem.\n  * Supports the EDF initiative by ensuring that projects funded through it are transparent and trustworthy.\n\n## Roadmap\n\n* Migrate from meme and relaunch on Hercules DEX (complete)\n* Relaunch our project reviews with new unbiased approach and hired team members (complete)\n* CEG\n* Leadership Elections - On Chain voting (complete)\n* Begin official DAO structuring to become “sufficiently decentralized”\n* Grant Proposal\n\n* NFT collection partnership (L2LL)\n* Lending/Borrowing partnership\n* Official VestaDAO NFTs of our Newsletter - Each issue will have it’s own NFT that has a chance of degrading over time like a comic book or newspaper. \n* Create additional revenue streams and share the majority of that revenue with $VDAO holders via a staking pool (rewards to be in $METIS)\n\nGrowth, consistency, and relevance is imperative for our roadmap's success. Focusing on value first and worrying about revenue later. \n\n## Summary\n\nIn summary, Vesta aims to be the hub of information on Metis. We picture our website to be one of the first places one can start when researching our beloved ecosystem. Our emphasis will stay on remaining impartial and providing \"no bullshit info\". As you see above, we have some pretty cool shit planned and won’t be forcing direct token utility outside of governance.\nNot only do our project reviews come without a bias, but now more than ever, come without any bullshit.\n\n**We aren’t afraid to ask the hard questions.**\n\nWe aren’t afraid to make enemies if it means keeping users, investors, and traders of Metis safe and more informed.\n\n# Official Links \n\nWebsite: **[Vdao.online](https://vdao.online)**\nTwitter: https://x.com/VestaDAO\nTelegram: t.me/VestaDAO \nDocs: https://vdao-1.gitbook.io/vestadao-docs",

Our near half-decade of experience as Chainlink operators equips us to significantly contribute.\n\n# Service Level Agreements (SLAs)\n\n - Kukis Global will ensure a 99.95% uptime SLA for the Metis Sequencer, effective once the network is live, excluding any test phases or issues beyond our control, like sequencer bugs.\n\n - We'll maintain both physical and encrypted backups of Metis Sequencer keys for disaster recovery, ensuring continuous operation under any circumstances.\n\n# Community\n\nAs active members of the Metis community, Kukis Global will participate in events, forums, and media engagements to promote the Metis ecosystem's growth, focusing in the EU region.\n\nKukis Global aims to facilitate METIS staking on the sequencer, striving to amass 100,000 METIS to become a leading sequencer through partner collaborations.\n\n# Anti-Slashing Commitment\n\nWhile the Metis DAO is still defining slashing conditions, our interpretation suggests that avoiding them requires focusing on:\n\n - High uptime, connectivity, and availability;\n - Access to keys and backups maintenance;\n - A pledge to uphold the sequencing integrity.\n\nTo meet these requirements, Kukis Global plans to use highly balanced infrastructure and prioritize key security, as outlined in our SLA. Additionally, we commit to ethical transaction ordering and maintaining code integrity in line with Metis DAO's directives, avoiding any actions that could undermine the network (e.g., collusion with MEV traders).\n\n# Deployment Roadmap\n\nFollowing approval by the DAO to support Metis, we will adhere to the suggested timeline. The primary steps include:\n\n**1. Deployment Phase:** Initiate the Sequencer node operation and secure a minimum of 20,000 METIS, followed by sequencer registration.\n**2. Testing Phase:** Conduct thorough Sequencer node testing with the Metis team to meet all technical and security requirements, including the setup of necessary monitoring and alerting systems.\n**3. Launch:** Officially start our Sequencer Node operations upon successful testing.\n**4. Ongoing Monitoring and Optimization:** Continually monitor node performance, with regular updates and adjustments as required for maximum efficiency and security.\nSupport Kukis Global\n\n**Please consider voting for Kukis Global**\n\n# Official Links\n* **Website**: [https://kukis-global.com ](https://kukis-global.com/)\n* **Twitter:** [https://twitter.com/KukisGlobal](https://twitter.com/KukisGlobal)\n* **Rated:** [https://explorer.rated.network/o/Kukis%20Global?network=mainnet&timeWindow=all&idType=nodeOperator](https://explorer.rated.network/o/Kukis%20Global?network=mainnet&timeWindow=all&idType=nodeOperator)",

      "content": "## Sequencer Proposal: H2O Nodes\n \n![h2onode.jpeg](ipfs://bafybeibiiln7ybxrjt73akwioqhmslbarh5fmeu7yokranwh3okfmk2vf4)\n    \n### Executive Summary\n\nH2O Nodes GmbH is a Vienna, Austria based node operator company founded in 2022 by Daniel Urstöger and Max Sherwood, currently staking >$50m in assets. Our core competency is running bare metal infrastructure, with the aim of boosting decentralization for liquid staking pools and node operator sets of new layer-1 blockchains. We would be delighted to run a decentralized sequencer for the Metis L2, contributing to its decentralization and good performance.\n\nWe currently run mainnet validators on Solana, Sui, and Ethereum, and testnet validators on Aleo, Berachain, dWallet, Supra, and NodeSet. On Ethereum we are long-time supporters of DVT, having tested the Obol and SSV implementations, and now are part of Lido’s SimpleDVT module on mainnet. We are also actively engaged running validators at scale [on Ethereum’s Holesky testnet](https://explorer.rated.network/o/H2O%20Nodes?network=holesky&timeWindow=all&idType=nodeOperator) to explore remote signers and other technologies - our performance is ranked in the top 15%.\n\n### Service Level Agreements (SLAs)\n\nWe are confident in our ability to run a Metis sequencer with a 99.95% uptime. This is based on the uptime of our most challenging chain, Solana, where we have achieved a [30-day uptime](https://stakewiz.com/validator/FCvNkHa4U3yh7AXWGGL2jWLWiSRouR8EtzY5WVTHKTHa) of 99.98%. On Ethereum, by using technologies like Vouch/Dirk or DVT, we are able to achieve fault tolerance via threshold signing, so that an issue with a single instance or key does not affect the liveness of a validator. For more “vanilla” setups, we run a number backup beacon nodes synced with a variety of clients, so that we can connect to any in case of a problem with a primary. Most of our validators are run on our own hardware in our “home” data center outside Frankfurt, but we also have access to bare metal hardware from other providers in other locations to boost geographic decentralization, if desired.\n\nOn a hardware level, our network is built with redundancy in mind so there is no single point of failure - components like switches and routers each have a backup. As DDOS protection we use Arbor as an on site solution, our firewall solution is an OPNsense cluster with IDS and IPS from Zenarmor. Physical access to the datacenter is monitored, logged and audited to industry standards. (ISO 27001, IDW PS951) The access system uses biometric data to validate access. Management access to the nodes is secured via VPN (2FA only), access to the OS is handled with Public / Private keys. For change management we have a ticket system with audit logs and a test setup which we use to verify and validate the updates.\n\nWe have comprehensive monitoring and alerting, and our team is able to respond to issues at any time. For alerting we run Atlassian OpsGenie, and as a backup we have Pager Duty. For internal monitoring tools we use check_mk, Loki, Prometheus and Grafana. We also have alerts for hardware-level warnings, as well as for the virtual machines which run the validator clients.\n\n### Benefits for Community (optional)\n\nCo-founder Max Sherwood is an active member of the communities that H2O Nodes is a part of, for example his [research highlighting the decentralization](https://ultimate.app/blog/why-solana-is-more-decentralized-than-you-think) of Solana's validator set was featured by [multiple publications](https://cointelegraph.com/news/solana-said-to-be-more-decentralized-than-people-think-but-there-s-more) and inspired the Solana Foundation to publish their first-ever “[validator health report](https://solana.com/news/validator-health-report-august-2022)” two weeks later. During the two most recent chain outage incidents on Solana, H2O Nodes were among the first validators to signal readiness for restart and were inspired to help [organize](https://hackmd.io/1DFauFMWTZG37-U7CXhxMg?view#Solana-Community-Led-Validator-Call-Agendas) a monthly Solana validator [community-led discussion](https://twitter.com/H2oNodes/status/1653457496244383745) which has now been ongoing for over one year.\n\nWe have found that organizing such validator community discussions on a regular basis have been invaluable for sharing key learnings, voicing concerns, and discussing important governance topics, and would be happy to help with the organization of such a call for Metis operators, if there is appetite.\n\nOn the technical side, we are always happy to share dashboards, performance metrics for our hardware setup, and key learnings in discord, especially during critical testnet phases.\n\n### Integration Roadmap\n\nOur current work is focused on helping bring Aleo, Berachain, dWallet, and Supra through their testnet phases and eventually to mainnet. We are also bringing on more freelancers to help boost our resources and develop deeper focuses on individual blockchains. Aside from purchasing our own hardware, we are furthering our partnerships with bare metal providers, expanding our footprint on Ethereum with the set-up of infrastructure for SSV, StakeWise, and NodeSet, and gaining experience on Ethereum testnet with fault-tolerant technologies like SSV DVT, Obol DVT, and Dirk / Vouch for eventual deployment on mainnet.\n\n### Official Links: Website, Docs, Audits, etc.\n\n* Website: [www.h2o-nodes.com](http://www.h2o-nodes.com)\n* Twitter: https://x.com/H2oNodes\n* LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/98952335",

      "content": "![100364794e6cae4e1ff55377c0910f403d2b41cf_2_586x289.jpeg](ipfs://bafybeieputmtzf4zq364mqjdnrvxbd67fkddmovy6a4mukgnrtnwgkqrlq)\n\nNodies has been a long-time supporter of Metis, and we are incredibly excited for the opportunity to become part of the Metis Decentralized Sequencer Pool.\n\n### Executive Summary\n\nNodies (https://nodies.app) is a web3 infrastructure company offering a broad range of services, including RPC, Snapshots, Validators, and Data Lake. Nodies hosts these on multi-regional, bare-metal servers, ensuring top-tier performance, high QoS, and enterprise-level SLAs. Founded by ex-AWS engineers and with over 3 years of experience in operating blockchain nodes, Nodies' RPC performance is second to none, as evidenced by our own benchmarking using open-source methodologies (link [here](https://docs.nodies.app/performance-benchmarks/optimism-benchmarks)), as well as independent testing conducted by [CompareNodes](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/comparenodes_web3-developer-rpc-activity-7155899346863992832-tBh6?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop).\n\nIn addition to RPC services, Nodies recently expanded into validator services. We currently manage validators on several networks, including Ethereum, Ripple, Planq, Pocket, Source, and Subsquid, with a TVL of over $50 million USD. \n\n### Testnet Sequencer Participant\n\nWe participated in running a testnet Metis sequencer. During this collaboration, we worked closely with the Sequencer Support Team, helping in debugging and offering crucial feedback and logs throughout the process.\n\n### Service Level Agreements (SLAs)\n\nNodies currently supports 28 chains - one of which being Metis - while constantly expanding, and has to-date served over 1 trillion RPC requests. Our infrastructure is designed with multiple redundancy layers, ensuring a 99.9% uptime across all of our services. Furthermore, we maintain servers in 4 different geographical regions to optimize latency for users worldwide.\n\n### Benefits for Community\n\nSince 2023, Nodies has been in a significant partnership with the Metis Lab Foundation, acting as their preferred provider of RPC services. We have a public [Metis RPC endpoint](https://docs.metis.io/dev/readme/connection-details), available for use by anyone in the Metis community. Our team maintains ongoing communication with the Metis core team and frequently discusses with developers of Metis dApps (such as Ormi, Unidex, and Artemis) to ensure their specific RPC needs are adequately addressed.\n\nIn keeping with our partnership with Metis, Nodies recently co-sponsored the [Bufficorns Dreamland opening event at EthDenver](https://x.com/MetisFest/status/1760836600794071345?s=20) and had a great time connecting with the Metis community!\n\n### Integration Roadmap\n\nAs we did during the Testnet Sequencer phase, Nodies will work with the Metis Sequencer Support Team to coordinate the deployment of the new sequencer node. Given our previous experience, Nodies is confident that we will have the resources necessary for a successful and prompt deployment.\n\n### Official Links: Website, Docs, Audits, etc.\n\nWebsite - https://nodies.app\n\nTwitter - https://twitter.com/nodies_infra\n\nDiscord - [https://nodies.app/discord](https://nodies.app/discord)\n\nTelegram - @giantfrog",

      "title": "Infrastructure - Sequencer Proposal: TEB",
      "content": "### Executive Summary\n\n* TEB is an Web3 advisory firm that specializes in ecosystem development and Go-To-Market strategies in Korea, providing services to 15+ blockchain projects, including Metis. TEB has been leading the promotion and branding of Metis in Korea through 1) localized content creation, 2) KOLs and media partners activation, 3) community management, and 4) offline event support.\n\n* TEB is keen to participate as a node operator for the Sequencer Pool by utilizing its validator arm B-Harvest. B-Harvest ([bharvest.io](http://bharvest.io)) is a blockchain validator within the Cosmos and Ethereum ecosystem, expanding its expertise into the development of DeFi protocols and conducting R&D on Cosmos SDK and EVM.\n\n### Service Level Agreements (SLAs)\n\n* TEB supports its blockchain layer partners in the form of node operation through TEB’s validator business arm in B-Harvest.\n* B-Harvest provides validation services for multiple dPoS networks to ensure decentralized governance. The list of networks include: Archway, Axelar, Band Protocol, Canto, Celestia, Coreum, Cosmos Hub, Injective, Kava, MultiversX, Neutron, Nibiru, Noble, Osmosis, Rarimo, Secret Network, Stride, Sui, Vega, Wemix, and Xpla.\n* B-Harvest currently has total staked assets of $83M with 25,000 delegators across Cosmos based networks, and $47M with 3,000 delegators across other L1 networks, committing to an uptime of 99.9%.\n* B-Harvest leverages both public clouds (AWS, GCP, Azure) and baremetal clouds (OVH, Vultr, Leaseweb, PhoenixNAP) across Korea, US, and Europe regions in order to distribute our servers to different locations with proper HW specs and failover plan.\n\n### Benefits for Community (optional)\n\n* Since 4Q24, TEB has acted as the Korean ambassador of Metis, building its retail presence from virtually none to a community of more than 1,500+.\n* TEB has utilized its Learn2Earn platform - [benft.io](http://benft.io) - to create contents and campaigns focusing on Metis. 25+ unique articles were written and 2 quests (eg. performing testnet transactions for the Community Testing event) were executed, which can be referred to [here](https://www.benft.io/token/metis). .\n* TEB was instrumental in securing sponsorship titles for Metis during EthSeoul and SheFi Korea. TEB staff actively supported during the events, leading booth duties and promoting Metis’s sponsor role through its KOLs and media partners.\n* TEB will continue to commit to the aforementioned community engagements. As a Sequencer however, TEB will leverage B-Harvest’s expertise in developer relations to host offline events in the nature of open lectures and hackathons to target Korean devs. This would enable TEB to expand its ecosystem builder role, additionally serving as tech advisor of Metis for the Korean community.\n\n### Integration Roadmap\n\nWe will add a few processes to the standard integration approach created internally at B-Harvest. These are as follows:\n\n1. Cloud selection and security rating\n\n  * Select an instance and cloud that meets the standard specifications recommended by Metis Sequencer and the characteristics of your sequencer.\n  \n  * Follow the standard security settings for instances on the Sequencer node, including basic OS security and administrator tiers\n\n2. Automation deployment\n\n  * Automate the Metis Sequencer setup guide as much as possible.\n  * Choose and work with infrastructure tools that match the characteristics of your sequencer, or develop your own. These can be open-sourced in the future.\n  * In addition to the Metis Sequencer nodes, the monitoring and alerting systems are included in this automation.\n\n3. Enable monitoring\n\n  * Identify basic metrics for a well-functioning sequencer, and integrate them into Grafana and Prometheus\n  * Analyze the appropriate thresholds for those metrics, and apply them to alerting\n\n4. Deploy the product\n\n  * Once all the preliminary work is done, deployment is the next step.\n  * For node configuration files, follow the usual conventions\n  * For other additional items, deploy according to your own conventions\n\n5. Further maintenance\n\n  * As issues arise during the deployment and post-deployment phase, we share and collaborate with other sequencers and the community.\n\n### Official Links: Website, Docs, Audits, etc.\n\n* Status for Cosmos Validator\n\n* [Cosmos Network Validators](https://www.mintscan.io/visualization/validators/bharvest)\n\n* Non-Cosmos Validator Status\n\n* [Sui Validator](https://suiscan.xyz/mainnet/validator/0x641c736d38b329dae7879d5164566e9256825c5fc82b2565b50d45e6a6522c1d/info)\n* [MultiversX Validator](https://explorer.multiversx.com/providers/erd1qqqqqqqqqqqqqqqpqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqq58llllsvkkv8s)\n* [Wemix Validators (26th in the list)](https://wemix.fi/staking/wonder)\n* [ChainLink Operator](https://www.chainlinkecosystem.com/ecosystem/b-harvest)\n* [Kroma Security CounCil](https://blog.kroma.network/announcing-kroma-security-council-435b540d2ab4)\n\n* [B-Harvest Introduction](https://bharvest.notion.site/B-Harvest-Introduction-d0619703867a4c43a40bd2e118f11be0)\n* Other achievements of B-Harvest:\n  * Cosmos OG Validator\n    * Main OG involved since Cosmos Hub's early testnet days\n    * 2nd place overall in Game of Stake (Validator Competition)\n    * Game of Zones, Game of Chains Never jail group\n  * R&D contribution\n    * ICF grant: Tendermint/Cosmos-SDK feature development\n      * Validator key rotation feature\n      * Double-signing protection feature\n      * Improved node peer management feature\n    * ICF bug bounty: Tendermint/Cosmos-SDK bug bounty score 1st Overall\n    * Tendermint(AiB) grant\n      * Liquidity module Implementation: First orderbook/AMM hybrid DEX\n      * Budget module Implementation: Governance-based token inflation management\n      * Farming module Implementation: Ability to manage DeFi liquidity incentives\n      * Liquid staking module Implementation: Securitization features of staking positions\n  * Other contribution\n    * Kava audit: codebase + financial models\n    * Web3 Foundation grant: Polkadot Substrate feature development\n    * Terra grant: financial model advisory, oracle node development\n    * Injective: Contributed multiple core features and found and fixed critical bugs\n    * Secret Network: 1st prize in dApp competition (CosmWasm)\n    * Celestia: 1st prize in validator competition\n  * Community meetups\n    * [DeTalks](https://bharvest.notion.site/DeTalks-Let-s-Talk-About-DeFi-323dc419dca8420dae4f25e0ea4a6462)",

Artifact was founded in 2020 with the sole objective of positively influencing the growth and development of the cryptocurrency industry. Artifact is 100% self-funded and has no outstanding debt, financial obligations, or investors.\n\nIn addition to being a Chainlink Oracle operator, our global team of seventeen people run infrastructure on over 53 blockchains. Artifact processes approximately 4 billion RPC requests per month and has $1.2 billion of USD equivalent stake across our entire platform, primarily in Ethereum, Aptos, Sui, and Avalanche.\n\nUnlike most infrastructure providers, Artifact owns and operates our own fleet of servers within our own secure racks. We have racks in multiple data centers located in the United States, Costa Rica, Ireland, and Japan. Our ability to build custom servers for our clients gives us serious competitive edge over the standardized server offerings available from cloud providers.\n\nWe take geographical decentralization very seriously and invest substantial time and money into ensuring that we operate in regions that add to diversification. As an example of our commitment to decentralization, Artifact is the only Web3 infrastructure provider in the world that operates nodes out of Central America.\n\n**Metis Experience**\n\nArtifact has years of experience with running Metis validators as well as Metis full nodes. We run multiple redundant full nodes that are positioned behind load balancers.\n\n**Service Level Agreement**\n\nArtifact currently operates on more than 53 blockchains for numerous Web3 institutions. We offer a 99.9% uptime SLA to our enterprise clients which we will extend to our Metis Sequencers. We will deploy multiple sequencer nodes in a primary/secondary arrangement across multiple physical locations to ensure hardware redundancy and enable robust failover capabilities.\n\nOur globally distributed Node Operations team is on call 24/7 and utilizes real time system monitoring and alerting to stay on top of our Metis node fleet. In addition, we have a suite of proprietary automated failover tools.\n\n**Benefits to Community**\n\nArtifact Systems is active in the Metis community. Most recently we acted as one of the lead sponsors for the Metis’s Official Opening Party for ETH Denver. In addition to assisting Metis with funding community parties, we also sponsor and host hacker houses in North America, South America, and Europe.\n\nWe will gladly spend a portion of our sequencer revenue on supporting the community through parties and hacker houses.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/MetisFest/status/1749462356969635967\n\n**Integration Roadmap**\n\nIf we are selected to operate a sequencer, Artifact will quickly take the required steps to launch our primary sequencer and sequencer hot spares on mainnet.\n\n**Artifact Pledge**\n\n**Artifact commits to provide Sequencer as a Service with the goal to ensure network stability and continuous improvement of the Metis project:**\n\n* We will be highly responsive to Metis software updates, governance proposals, and provide any and all non-client privileged data as needed.\n* We will meet or exceed the minimum required hardware and security specifications.\n* Collaborate with the Metis team, other Metis operators, and the Metis community as a whole to share best practices, tools, recommendations, and community education as needed.\n\n**Artifact will meet or exceed Metis’ Reliability Standards:**\n\n* Our Solana RPC business line has given us hands-on experience with managing highly intensive and rapidly expanding hardware requirements. As a result, we run oversized hardware on all of our chains.\n* Due to our tendency to run oversized nodes, we feel that we will maintain high standards for liveness and participation.\n* Artifact is known for providing high uptimes and has never been slashed, jailed, or “soft-slashed” for outages or quality of service on any other blockchain.\n* Artifact commits to using a diverse set of data center providers and cloud providers.\n* Artifact recognizes that most node operators utilizes the same cloud providers such as AWS, Google Could, and Hetzner. In the spirit of decentralization, Artifact does not use these providers unless specifically mandated by a client or blockchain project.\n\n**Official Links**\n\nhttps://artifact-systems.io/",

      "content": "**Executive Summary**\n\nMetis' decentralized Proof of Stake (PoS) sequencer pool, a cornerstone of its blockchain infrastructure, enhances network decentralization and stability through a multi-sequencer system. This model allows users to directly participate in sequencer benefits. MatrixedLink, a Chainlink Node Operator and Node Service Provider, proposes to run a sequencer for the decentralized sequencer pool, having been in continuous communication with the Metis Foundation.\n\nMatrixedLink has a notable track record, contributing significantly to the Chainlink Network, specifically with the creation of the first custom DON (GainsNetwork), a highly profitable Decentralized Oracle Network. Over 10 million on-chain oracle requests have been fulfilled, securing billions in Total Value Locked (TVL). Noteworthy collaborations include Chainlink, GainsNetwork, Infura, Enjin and Lido Finance, showcasing our expertise and reliability.\n\nChainlink:\nWe run infrastructure on multiple chains for Chainlink. Some of our Chainlink oracle nodes:\n- [Ethereum](https://etherscan.io/address/0x1feec90f63b1927d1078d123a57f940e680a3abf)\n- [Polygon](https://polygonscan.com/address/0x5543ff441d3b0fcce59aa08eb52f15d27294af21)\n- [Arbitrum](https://arbiscan.io/address/0x64ae501217d502be8a1d9d4a4f669fbac6a0c062)\n- [Scroll](https://scrollscan.com/address/0xdc7ef1e6caf0a4b3717133ba165d20feed0c646d)\n- [Base](https://basescan.org/address/0x02e9137940be6803d333eb1451c3834c96ca9c2d)\n- [Zksync](https://era.zksync.network/address/0xe83a339bf4d658020a08cf2ab24d2e6cb7479129)\n\nGainsNetwork:\nWe are a genesis oracle operator on the [gTrade DEX](https://gains.trade/). We have already fulfilled over 5 million oracle requests on-chain since 2021 for gTrade. By running a Chainlink Node for the platform we contribute to securing over $200m daily volume and over $200M TVL across multiple chains. \n\nInfura:\nWe are part of the [Decentralized Infrastructure Network](https://www.infura.io/solutions/decentralized-infrastructure-service) by Infura/Consensys. We contribute to the decentralization of the infrastructure layer by running RPC-nodes for this initiative. Infura is the oldest RPC-provider in the market and also powers Metamask.\n\nEnjin:\n[Enjin](https://enjin.io/) is an NFT platform project that has its own ecosystem of multiple blockchains. We run infrastructure in the form of multiple different Nodes for them, contributing to the securing of close to $500M TVL . \n\nLido Finance:\nWe are part of the Lido DVT Testnet. By running a highly performant [SSV operator](https://holesky.ssvscan.io/operator/16), we help Lido Finance test out the new DVT technology. As seen with the successful Obol Network DVT Testnet, it is expected that highly performant operators will deploy on mainnet soon.\n\nYou can read about most of our integrations on our [website](https://www.matrixedlink.io/). \n\n**Service Level Agreements**\n\nOperational Performance\n\nMatrixedLink maintains peak operational performance for its servers, ensuring meticulous management and optimization of all nodes. With a commitment to a reliable and efficient operational environment, downtime and disruptions are minimized, supporting the continuous flow of high-speed transactions. Our SLAs boast a 99.95% uptime for some validators and public endpoints, with a service response time usually within a minute, facilitated by a custom alerting solution and a red-phone system.\n\n**Benefits for community**\n\nAs a founding Node Operator of the [stake.link](https://stake.link/) DAO, MatrixedLink has contributed to the accrual of $36M TVL. In collaboration with the DAO and the Metis Foundation, we aim to deploy stake.link on Metis L2 for the Decentralized Sequencer Pool. This integration ensures that highly performant and professional Node Operators, such as ourselves, secure Metis L2, opening up opportunities for the Chainlink and Metis community. \n\n**Integration Roadmap**\n\nUpon the acceptance of this proposal, MatrixedLink will promptly initiate the implementation steps required to become an active sequencer operator on Metis L2. We are committed to a swift and efficient process.\n\n**Official Links**\n\n- [Website](https://www.matrixedlink.io/)\n- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/MatrixedLink)\n- [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/company/matrixedlink)",

      "content": "![Northwest.jpeg](ipfs://bafybeiclybspf55jpjgt7va7iy477n6pvo2akuqyfycrkljfoqwzx7pdza)\n    [NorthWest Nodes](https://www.northwestnodes.com) is incredibly honored and excited to to be a candidate for the Metis Decentralized Sequencer pool. A robust decentralized sequencer is an incredibly important next step in the evolution of rollups, and we take this opportunity very seriously. \n\n**About NorthWest Nodes**\n\nEstablished in 2021, starting in Canada and having since moved operations to Dubai, NorthWest Nodes brings decades of infrastructure, DevOps, and incident response experience into the world of Web3. Starting as the winners of Chainlinks [Oracle Olympics](https://blog.chain.link/announcing-the-winner-of-oracle-olympics-1/) competiton, the team has expanded into the world of RPC provision, monitoring support, and DevOps consultation. Described by Chainlink Labs as having \"raised the bar for Node Operations\", NorthWest Nodes prides ourselves in having some of the most robust monitoring, security, and uptime statistics possible in the world of blockchain. We have ongoing notable collaborations with Chainlink, Infura, and Truflation, and have helped secure Billions of dollars of TVL across these projects. \n\nThe company currently runs nodes on 16 chains, and has been a supporter of [Chainlink Price Feeds on Metis](https://www.metis.io/blog/chainlink-price-feeds-are-now-live-on-metis-helping-provide-our-defi-ecosystem-with-high-quality-price-data#:~:text=The%20integration%20of%20Chainlink%20Price,%2Deffective%20blockchain%2Dbased%20applications.) since the its inception. We have run a redundant Metis RPC setup for over a year, with no major incidents. We also are one of the select few nodes running the [CCIP](https://chain.link/cross-chain) network, of which Metis is slated to be added to in short order. \n\nWith highly automated resource provisioning, redundancy planning, and robust scaling solutions, we are able to meet any demands that running a sequencer can offer. We have never faced any slashing penalty in our operations, and aim to continue this spotless record. We are a self-funded company, and are managed by our founders. We have only obligations to ourselves.\n\n**Our Commitment to Metis**\n\n* We commit to meeting a 99.95% uptime with the sequencer, consistent with our other node operations, which have exceeded 99.95% in their history. Please be aware that this SLA does not encompass situations or events beyond our reasonable control, known as 'force majeure' events. These include, but are not limited to, natural disasters, acts of terrorism, civil unrest, acts of government, or any other circumstances that significantly obstruct our ability to fulfill our service obligations.\n\n* We commit to server response times as fast as possible, and can deploy resources globally to minimize all response times.\n\n* We commit to immediate incident response for all critical issues, with alerting times set to between 0-5 minutes depending on severity.\n\n* We commit to running fair transactions, and take no malicious action in the running of the sequencer.\n\n* We commit to engaging with the team and community at large to find any bugs, report any potential disruptive behavior, and do everything in our power to ensure the decentralized sequencer is a huge success.\n\n* We commit to helping redundancy of the network, by not using the most popular platforms such as AWS, GCP, or Hetzner for our operations.\n\n* We commit to supporting the chain, the ecosystem, and the community for it's lifetime.\n\n**Deployment**\n\nUpon acceptance of this proposal, we will act as follows.\n\n* Define the resources needed for node operation, monitoring, and incident response. \n\n* Build the nodes and all supporting infrastructure.\n\n* Collaborate with the Metis team and other operators on testing, monitoring, alerting, and bug-hunting to help ensure maximum performance of all operators.\n\n* Continuously monitor node performance, share feedback, and improve functionality over time.\n\n**LINKS**\n\n[Website](https://www.northwestnodes.com)\n[Twitter](https://twitter.com/NorthwestNodes)\n[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/northwest-nodes)",

      "content": "![3c27d11d3cccd6c3f7ebfb78ddede87c3febd878.png](ipfs://bafkreierpnj2d7qfhgu2th5fbeee4vmguqtwb6n3aetg7nimtqnzcer5z4)\n # Summary\n\n[Pier Two](https://piertwo.com) would be a great candidate to support the Metis Decentralised Sequencer ecosystem.\n\n**Here’s more on Pier Two:**\nPier Two operates Australian-based enterprise-grade infrastructure for institutional clients. Which includes operating infrastructure for the Metis ecosystem with Chainlink Data Feed support. Pier Two has been supporting Chainlink since testnet, and was onboarded to mainnet in 2019.\n\nOperationally, Pier Two is providing secure staking services for >USD$350M in assets across several blockchain networks, primarily Ethereum.\n\nPier Two is committed to open-source development, and has contributed to implementations of messaging standards like Discv5.\n\nSupporting Arbitrum since mainnet launch in 2021, Pier Two is one of 9 validators selected by Arbitrum to operate Arbitrum infrastructure.\n\nIn remaining at the cutting edge of industry developments, Pier Two actively contributes and participates in the EigenLayer ecosystem with AVS and LRT support.\n\nPier Two remains committed to security, reliability and support for networks we operate infrastructure. Based on the experience of Pier Two's team and alignment with the values of open source development, we believe Pier Two represents a perfect candidate for the sequencer pool. Here’s some more reason’s why: \n\n1. Metis Operational Experience\n2. Performance Feedback\n3. SLAs\n4. Community\n5. Anti-Slashing Commitment\n\nFollowing this we discuss our Deployment Roadmap.\n\n# Metis Operational Experience\n\nWe currently run two Metis full nodes for our Chainlink Infrastructure, so adding any support for the sequencer would be trivial. As a team that has been operating Chainlink infrastructure for nearly 5 years, we have a lot of experience running infrastructure that depend on consistent connectivity to load balanced RPCs. \n\n# Performance Feedback\n\nShould Pier Two be successful in this proposal, we will provide continuous feedback to the Metis team on how to improve the sequencer technology and optimise it for the Metis L2. \n\nWe believe that we can help to set standards for other Sequencer Nodes with respect to monitoring, alerting and best practices around security and operation. With our experience as Chainlink operators for nearly 5 years we believe we’re more than capable.\n\nLastly, Pier Two [has previously built discv5 in c#](https://piertwo.com/blog/discv5-explainer-series-1/) so we have a solid technical understanding of the p2p layer that is required for the Metis Sequencers to be performant and networked in the decentralised system. \n\n# **Service Level Agreements (SLAs)**\n\n1. We will maintain a 99.95% uptime SLA with the Metis Sequencer. Note that this will be once the network commences, not in any test phases, as well as anything that is in Pier Two’s control versus sequencer bugs or issues.\n2. We will maintain both cold physical and encrypted backups of Metis Sequencer keys in the event of disaster. This is in place in the rare scenario that the signers of the MPC setup that controls `MetisSequencerSet` contract settings lost access - the Pier Two sequencer could continue to operate in any event.\n\n# **Community**\n\nAs members of the Metis community we will participate in events, online forums and media to support the growth of the Metis ecosystem with the Pier Two brand. With a focus on APAC, primarily Australia, Pier Two can help build awareness of Metis across different events and be a touch point for the APAC industry connecting to Metis.\n\nPier Two is willing to work with partners of Metis to facilitate METIS staking on the sequencer. Pier Two will strive to achieve 100,000 METIS by working with partners in order be as prevalent a sequencer as possible.\n\n# Anti-Slashing Commitment\n\nWhilst slashing conditions are still to be determined by Metis DAO, from the documentation released so far in [this post](https://ceg.vote/t/governance-proposal-decentralized-sequencer-governance/1922), it would appear that in order to avoid slashing conditions sequencer operators must focus on the primary areas: \n\n1. High uptime, connectivity & availability;\n2. Maintaining access to keys + backups; and\n3. A commitment to maintaining sequencing status quo.\n\nIn order to address number one and two, Pier Two would approach the sequencer operation with as much load balanced infrastructure as possible and a focus on key security as already mentioned above in the SLA section. To address number 3,  Pier Two would commit to not ordering transactions maliciously or modify the sequencer code in any way that extracts value or isn’t aligned with the Metis DAO’s mandate (e.g. collusion with MEV traders). \n\n# **Deployment Roadmap**\n\nAfter being successfully voted in to support Metis we will operate on the DAO’s suggested timeline. But the basic steps would be to\n\n1. **Deployment Phase:** Start running the Sequencer node and acquire the minimum 20,000 METIS. This will include [registering our sequencer details](https://github.com/MetisProtocol/metis-sequencer-resources?tab=readme-ov-file) once up and running. \n2. **Testing Phase**: Engage in comprehensive testing of the Sequencer node in coordination with the Metis team to ensure compliance with all technical requirements and security standards. This will include adding any relevant monitoring and alerting around the Metis Sequencer - including the recommended [prometheus exporter paired](https://github.com/MetisProtocol/metis-sequencer-exporter) with Grafana. \n3. **Launch**: Officially commence operations as a Sequencer Node following successful.\n4. **Ongoing Monitoring and Optimisation**: Continuous monitoring of node performance with periodic updates and optimisations as needed to maintain optimal efficiency and security.\n\n**Vote Pier Two** \n\n# **Official Links**\n\n- **Website**: https://piertwo.com\n- **Twitter:** https://twitter.com/PierTwo_com\n- **Github:** https://github.com/Pier-Two",

      "content": "**Executive Summary**\n\n* A41 (www.a41.io), based in Seoul, is a blockchain infrastructure provider established in 2022.\n* As one of the fastest-growing validators last year, A41 has actively participated in 20+ blockchains including LSP (Liquid Staking Protocols) s such as Lido and mETH as an operator. Recognized as a trusted infrastructure provider with a proven track record of excellence, we deliver optimal performance and security.\n\n* Our total staked assets have reached $2.2 billion, managing 1.5% of Ethereum staking. The infrastructure team consists of six senior full-time DevOps engineers, supporting 24/7 node operation. Each team member possesses technical expertise in cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure, and blockchain engineering.\n\n**Service Level Agreement**\n\n1. We have onboarded a total of 20+ blockchains, including Aptos, SUI, Solana, ETH, Polygon, Flare, Archway, CosmosHub, dydx, Finschia, Haqq, Kyve, Medibloc, Neutron, Noble, Osmosis, Sei, Stargaze, Stride, Tenet, Zetachain, NEAR, and Injective. \n\n2. We commit to providing a 99.9% uptime Service Level Agreement (SLA) to our clients. Our baremetal infrastructure is hosted at KT Gangnam IDC (Tier IV) and KT Seocho Datacenter (Tier III) in Seoul, Korea. \n\n3. We utilize baremetal with Hardware Security Modules (HSMs), specifically YubiHSM2. Additionally, our cloud operations include backup servers and monitoring/alert systems on AWS (regions: Seoul, Tokyo, Osaka) and seven servers in the EU region via VSP (OVH). Our DevOps team ensures 24/7 monitoring and respond to errors or update nodes through the bastion host which needs two-factor authentication.\n\n**Integration Roadmap**\n\n1. As mentioned above, A41 operates as a node operator managing over 20 blockchain networks and more than 15,000 Ethereum Validators. Providing a large-scale infrastructure environment, we will securely support the operation of Metis. We have established a 24/7 monitoring environment and alert system, ensuring high levels of liveness by applying our expertise to operate the Metis Sequencer.\n\n2. We will collaborate with the Metis team and other operators to support the construction of a safer decentralized sequencing infrastructure. A41 owns two physically separated data centers in Seoul, South Korea, where we operate most chains in a bare-metal environment. This contributes to the regional decentralization of Metis and decentralization from cloud providers.\n\n**Benefits to community**\n\n* A41 actively contributes to the Metis community by (1) building brand awareness and (2) providing Go-To-Market (GTM) support for the Asia-Pacific (APAC) region, especially Korea.\n\n* During ETH Denver, A41 hosted the \"Stakeholder: Infra Open House,\" co-hosted by Metis. By representing the session on \"L2 and Rollup,\" A41 and Metis effectively co-built brand awareness. A41 aims to host a 2-day full infrastructure summit at the upcoming Token 2049 and side events in KBW. These marketing efforts aim to extend and effectively connect the Metis team with the APAC region.\n\n* In Staking Rewards, A41 has achieved the highest rating score, being recognized as an AAA verified staking operator.\n\n* Here are additional attachments to assess the performance and proven track record of A41.\n\n> Rated Network: https://www.rated.network/o/A41?network=mainnet&timeWindow=30d&viewBy=operator&page=1&idType=nodeOperator\n\n> Staking Rewards: https://www.stakingrewards.com/provider/a41",

      "title": "Ecosystem Proposal: Barsik – the mascot of Metis",
      "content": "**Disclaimer from CEG Team:** This is the second and final vote for Barsik, as the previous vote did not meet the quorum.\n\n![efea09c68101aab86fe5538fbfdf0c0a6c8dd935_2_667x500.jpg](ipfs://bafybeibwu7u3xkbqubfpolext76plz2gnirbp7gj5drqvn366a6dskj3nm)\n\n## Introduction\n**Barsik**; The Mascot of Metis Chain\n\nBarsik Community, nestled in the heart of the Metis chain, is a vibrant community\nThe internet has a soft spot for cats, and that love is translating into the world of cryptocurrency with Barsik. This purrfectly named memecoin isn’t just another cat-themed token – it’s named after Natalie’s beloved pet cat .\n\nBarsik holds court on the Metis Network, a blockchain known for its speed and affordability. Barsik is not just a memecoin, it’s a furry homage to the feline who stole Natalie’s heart.\n\n## Barsik Tools:\n\n**1. Token Locker:**\n\n- Implementing a Token Locker will enable Barsik Community to lock tokens for specific durations, promoting stability and preventing excessive sell-offs. This will instill confidence among investors and reduce volatility.\n- The Token Locker can be customized to offer various locking options, such as time-based locks, vesting schedules, and unlock conditions, providing flexibility to Barsik holders while ensuring long-term commitment.\n**2. Liquidity Locker:**\n\n- Integrating a Liquidity Locker will facilitate the management of liquidity pools associated with Barsik tokens. By locking liquidity for a predetermined period, it ensures the stability and depth of liquidity, enhancing trading efficiency and minimizing slippage.\n- The Liquidity Locker can be programmed to automatically replenish liquidity pools or release funds based on predefined criteria, optimizing liquidity utilization and promoting healthy market dynamics.\n\n**3. Multisender:**\n\n- Introducing a Multisender tool will streamline token distribution and incentivization within the Barsik Community. This feature enables efficient distribution of rewards, airdrops, and promotional tokens to multiple recipients simultaneously.\n- With Multisender, Barsik administrators can execute mass token transfers securely and transparently, fostering community engagement and participation in various initiatives. \n\n![15dff4675e9e1ba8ab195174bb83183de7b584ca_2_500x500.jpg](ipfs://bafybeidc4vhap3omigfzpou6hg26humaalweoen572tgqbk7zd5wxvae54)\n\n## Community Accomplishments:\n\nBarsik became the first memecoin on Metis to hit a $7 million all-time high (ATH), rocketing straight to the top.

Out of this satire and public outcry. \n\nLa Caca rises as a beacon from the meme world, symbolizing sarcasm and resistance.\n\nThe origins of La caca are wrapped in mystery and legend: some say it flowed from the Seine, others claim it was born in the Élysée Palace, and some believe it emerged from the La Louvre. However, we believe that La caca truly originates from the people. Just like normies, La Caca begins pure but must navigate a shitty world.\n\n## Why Us?\n\n**La caca guidant le peuple!**\n\n- La caca stands as a unique blend of satire and social commentary, engaging our nation through humor and irony.\n- We harnesses the power of memes to create a vibrant, interactive community.\nGood vibe only!\n\n## Benefits to the Metis Community\n\n- By tapping into current events and popular culture, La caca inspires resistance against injustice and hypocrisy, attracting significant traffic from the meme community.\n- This influx of interest will invigorate the Metis community, fostering engagement and solidarity.\n- Our project will act as a catalyst for community activation, uniting people around shared values and humor.\n## Why Now?\n\nIn a world rife with inequity and deceit, La caca stands as a symbol of the people’s resilience and desire for anti-censorship. Incorporating La caca into the Metis ecosystem allows us to leverage the power of memes to build a stronger, more united community.",

      "content": "# Background\nThe dynamics of Defi staking has changed rapidly and the Metis network having emerged as a promising Layer 2  set to decentralize its sequencers presents colossal opportunity for money markets and defi explorers looking to explore staking opportunities. Taking inspiration from the popular Metis quote\" “LSD will be the cornerstone of the Metis DeFi ecosystem \" Velix introduces innovative  solution: a liquid staking derivative (LSD) platform designed to simplify and enhance the staking experience of users within the Metis ecosystem. By enabling METIS token holders to participate in network security without sacrificing liquidity, Velix not only enhances financial product flexibility but also democratizes access to DeFi benefits through the Velix Protocol.\n\n## Velix Protocol Mechanism\n\nYield maximization through staking  is  at the heart of Velix's innovation, allowing  users who ordinarily would not be able to participate in sequencer mining due to minimum staking  requirements to stake their METIS tokens in exchange for veMETIS, a tokenized derivative. This process is underpinned by a sophisticated algorithm that delegates METIS tokens to high-performance sequencers, ensuring network security and consensus efficiency. veMETIS holders can further stake their tokens for sveMETIS, representing their stake and accruing rewards, thus maintaining liquidity and active participation in the DeFi ecosystem.\n\nGraphical representation of the Velix Protocol Mechanism\n \n![3f52040669345fc1a90fbffaad735e582aabef7d.png](ipfs://bafkreia2zpbe7algzfx53xldhj2xd45usokpueeum6jut3mybffnahhnzi)\n    \n## Key Components:\nThe guide outlines the simple process a user needs to go through to participate in Velix \nToken Deposit and Mint: Secure delegation of METIS tokens to sequencers via Velix, enhancing network integrity.\nLSD Issuance (veMETIS): Minting of veMETIS, enabling liquidity and seamless DeFi ecosystem engagement.\nReward Distribution: Auto-compounded rewards distributed in veMETIS to sveMETIS holders, amplifying yield potential.\n\n **Unique Features**\n\n1. Enhanced Yield through Auto-compounding, offerring a superior return on staked Metis. \n\n2. veMETIS issuance provides uninterrupted Liquidity for users, allowing for greater flexibility in utilizing staked asset (veMetis) across various DeFi applications within Metis ecosystem \n\n3. Seamless integration within the Metis ecosystem, facilitating interoperability and fluid exchange across DeFi platforms.\n\n4.Introduction of the Velix governance token to empower users to shape the protocol's future while incentivizing contributions to protocol security, efficiency and the overall democracy.\n \nTokenomics will soon be released for detailed overview\n\n### Connect with us \n[Website](https://www.velix.io/)\nTestnet (Coming soon)",

      "content": "# Introduction\nStaFi protocol is a liquid staking protocol for multiple POS blockchains. StaFi aims to solve the contradiction between Mainnet security and token liquidity in PoS consensus.\n\nUsers can stake PoS tokens through StaFi and receive rTokens in return, which are available for trading, while still earning staking rewards. rToken is a synthetic staking derivative issued by StaFi to users when users stake PoS tokens through StaFi [rToken App ](https://app.stafi.io/) . rTokens are anchored to the PoS tokens staked by users and the corresponding staking rewards. rTokens can be transferred and traded at any time.\n\nTo date, the platform has released up to 10 various liquid staking solutions including rETH (StaFi Staked ETH), rMATIC, rBNB, rATOM, among others.\n\n \n![c05754732f3ed0d3ac46c376bde004017baf2fac.png](ipfs://bafybeid3m2tlv4ac67sh3rgqmgi4pz7uvkne4uhz2vsichz5nwjbas62fi)\n    \n\n# Specification\n\n## CVP\n\nhttps://ceg.vote/t/cvp-proposal-new-metis-lst-rmetis-by-stafi/1594\n\n## Liquid Staking as a Service\n\nStaFi 2.0 will introduce LSD development frameworks and Liquid Staking as a Service (LSAAS), supporting ETH, EVM, and CosWasm. This will significantly reduce the complexity of LSD development, enabling quick deployment. The framework will also support METIS and introduce Liquid Staking as a Service (LSAAS) for METIS.\n\n*Check more details: https://mirror.xyz/0xBABf7e6b5bcE0BD749FD3C527374bEf8919cC7A9/bNtJk4LKO8DPW9so57eyLlltDdR8hkBe9jTrZNUv5UM*\n\n## rMETIS\n\nUsers can deposit METIS on the StaFi Protocol without any limitations based on their capacity. The deposited METIS is subsequently staked by StaFi’s staking contract, which autonomously selects the optimal sequencers to generate and maximize staking yields.\n\nUsers who deposit METIS on StaFi will receive an equivalent amount of rMETIS (rToken StaFi equivalent) to the value they staked. rMETIS is an erc20 and rebase token. Subsequently, users can freely trade rMETIS (rToken equivalent) or provide liquidity (LP) to earn additional yield. This additional yield can be staked alongside our reputable DEX partners on METIS.\n\n\n# More\n* Website: [https://stafi.io ](https://stafi.io/)\n* rToken App: [https://app.stafi.io](https://app.stafi.io/)\n* Document: [https://docs.stafi.io](https://docs.stafi.io/)\n* DeFilama: [https://defillama.com/protocol/stafi ](https://defillama.com/protocol/stafi)\n* Dune: https://dune.com/stafi-analysis/stafi\n* Github: [stafiprotocol · GitHub](https://github.com/stafiprotocol)\n* Audit: [security/audits at main · stafiprotocol/security · GitHub](https://github.com/stafiprotocol/security/tree/main/audits)\n* rLaunchpad: [New rToken on rLaunchpad - StaFi Protocol Governance](https://dao.stafi.io/c/newrtoken/2)",

      "content": "![dad6b8d6399a5817674da78f8a1e8afb50356afd.jpeg](ipfs://bafybeiagfi57hh6g7tal6vg7gsvpbbztfnqjxzdve7mxixnbnuqrfi64di)\n  \n## Introduction\n\n[stake.link](https://stake.link) proudly stands as a leading innovator in the realm of Chainlink staking, offering a top-tier liquid staking protocol that caters to the nuanced needs of both LINK token holders and the DeFi protocols that rely on the Chainlink infrastructure. We are excited to announce that the hallmark features that have distinguished the protocol in the Chainlink ecosystem are now set to enhance the Metis staking experience:\n\n* **Reliability Guarantees:** stake.link consists of not only the most performant Chainlink node operators, but also the most seasoned and veteran infrastructure providers and validators across all of Web3.\n* **Liquid Staking with sdlMETIS**: Our platform provides enhanced flexibility and liquidity for staked assets, making it easier for users to manage and utilize their staked assets.\n* **Full DeFi Composability:** The sdlMETIS token enables seamless integration and interaction with a broad spectrum of DeFi applications, expanding the utility and potential of staked assets.\n\nGiven that all Metis decentralized sequencer nodes to date operate as Chainlink Node Operators, and stake.link represents a coalition of the most veteran and performant 15 Chainlink Node Operators, there exists a natural and powerful synergy between the two ecosystems. This unique position allows stake.link to extend its streamlined staking experience from the Chainlink domain to the Metis ecosystem, ensuring an unparalleled staking experience for users. By leveraging our proven expertise and the strong interconnectedness of Chainlink and Metis nodes, we aim to forge a path toward enhanced staking solutions that benefit participants across both ecosystems.\n\n## Architecture\n\nstake.link’s architectural framework is strategically crafted to optimize the staking experience for our users. Initially, our platform will focus on a singular METIS pool strategy, though, the inherent modular design of our architecture allows for seamless expansion to include additional sequencers as we grow.\n\nThis flexibility not only positions stake.link to adapt and evolve within the dynamic DeFi landscape, but also enables us to tap into a variety of staking strategies over time. As we extend our reach to incorporate more sequencers, stake.link is poised to secure more and more TVL within the Metis network. Such an expansion will not only diversify the staking options available to users, but also enhance the overall staking experience across different strategies. This strategic foresight ensures that stake.link remains at the cutting edge of staking innovation, driving greater value and utility within the Metis ecosystem.\n\n## Cross-Chain Capabilities\n\nstake.link is thrilled to highlight its integration with Chainlink’s Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP), marking a pivotal advancement in the realm of blockchain technology. Initially enabling seamless LINK staking on the Arbitrum network, CCIP’s extension into the Metis network opens a new chapter for stake.link. Leveraging our extensive experience with LINK, we are now positioned to introduce the liquid staking token (LST) of METIS across a multitude of CCIP-supported networks.\n\nThis pivotal move not only broadens the scope of METIS staking, it also significantly enhances liquidity and growth prospects across DeFi and broader Onchain Finance ecosystem. By facilitating cross-chain liquidity, stake.link empowers METIS stakers to an unparalleled staking experience and ability to engage with a wider array of DeFi applications and services. This integration signifies our commitment to leveraging cutting-edge technology to provide users with safe and advanced staking solutions, and to drive forward the adoption and utility of METIS within the broader blockchain landscape.\n\n## Stats\n\n**TVL:** +$39M (March 2024)\n**Total Rewards Distributed:** +$2M\n**Multi-chain:** Ethereum Mainnet, Arbitrum (via Chainlink CCIP)\n\n## Integrations\n\n* Powered by the 15 leading Chainlink Node Operators\n* [Curve.fi](http://curve.fi/) (ETH Mainnet) +$3.6M Liquidity (stLINK/LINK)\n* Camelot (Arbitrum) +$2M Liquidity (wstLINK/LINK)\n\n## Strategy\n\nLeveraging the creation of the sdlMETIS liquid staking token, stake.link intends to build upon the robust foundation of its existing Liquid Staking Token (LST) models to streamline the user experience (UX) for both newcomers and seasoned participants within the DeFi sector. This strategic move is aimed at facilitating seamless entry and engagement with the Metis ecosystem, thereby accelerating adoption and utility across various DeFi applications.\n\nstake.link plans to integrate sdlMETIS with leading DeFi platforms to ensure wide usability. By partnering with major exchanges, lending platforms, and yield farming protocols, we aim to create a multifaceted ecosystem where sdlMETIS can be utilized for various financial services, including trading, borrowing, lending, and earning rewards. These integrations will facilitate greater exposure and demand for sdlMETIS, driving its value and utility within the DeFi landscape.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nstake.link is at the forefront of a revolutionary shift within the Metis ecosystem, embodying the essence of innovation and decentralization in liquid staking. Our mission is to bridge the divide between secure staking mechanisms and the expansive potential of DeFi, making it effortless for users to unlock the full value of their staked assets. By integrating cutting-edge technology with a user-centric approach, Stake.Link not only simplifies the staking process, but also enhances the liquidity and utility of staked tokens across a diverse range of platforms and applications.\n\nWe are committed to pushing the boundaries of what is possible within the Metis ecosystem, ensuring that Stake.Link not only contributes to its growth, but also paves the way for a more accessible DeFi landscape. As we embark on this journey, we look forward to collaborating with the Metis community and stakeholders to bring this vision to life, fostering a new era of growth and innovation.\n\n## Links\nhttps://stake.link/\nhttps://docs.stake.link/faq",

      "title": "Ecosystem Proposal: Owl Protocol - Dev suite to be used to build complete apps or integrations via a REST API",
      "content": "## Introduction\nOwl Protocol is a Web3 dev suite, that allows you to build complete apps or integrations with just a REST API, and includes onboarding with social logins for users. It is deployed with the latest features such as account abstraction, gasless transactions, and diamond upgradeable smart contracts.\n\nYou can read our simple API at docs.owlprotocol.xyz.\n\n\n## Value Proposition\nOwl Protocol brings immense value to Metis because now any developer can integrate web3, while using the latest technologies we support, meanwhile businesses can leverage their existing teams, without having to retrain or hire entire new teams. No longer do businesses create new trial or proof of concepts for web3, but rather they can integrate web3 directly into their software stack, and gain tangible, incremental improvements immediately.\n\nThis tackles a major issue we’ve seen with web3 adoption, where standalone web3 projects do not garner enough traction and ROI to justify the resources involved. One prime example is the Starbucks Odyssey project. Our approach is different, with our intuitive API, developers can add web3 features invisibly, then onboard users at their own pace.\n\n\n## Uniqueness Factor\nOwl Protocol is the only Web3 API that allows you to build advanced web3 projects completely with an API, because all of its smart contracts are deployed with the new EIP-2535 diamond upgradeable standard. These modular smart contracts remove the limitations that projects usually run into when moving beyond their proof of concept stage, where they discover that they need to redeploy everything again or implement their own upgradeability process.\n\n\n## Benefits for Users|\nOwl Protocol allows developers to invisibly create millions of smart wallets under the hood with MPC technology, and link the authentication to social logins such as Google, Apple ID, and more, allowing the easiest onboarding path for non-crypto users.\n\n\n## Benefits for the Metis Ecosystem\nThe Metis ecosystem with Owl Protocol becomes an attractive blockchain for mainstream adoption of web3 by traditional businesses, real world use cases, and non-crypto users. Developers can choose to entirely manage the user onboarding journey through social logins, and gradually introduce web3 concepts such as ownership, decentralization, and more.\n\n## Security/Audits\nDiamond Upgradeable Smart Contracts are used by other leading cutting edge projects such as Aavegotchi - https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2535 - and our specific contracts are currently in talks to be audited by the creator of the stand Nick Mudge. Our API is also scoped to each project, which limits the risk that each smart wallet is exposed to.\n\n\n## Roadmap\nOwl Protocol is already deployed on over 20 testnets and recently sponsored the Celestia Space Bazaar hackathon which was a great success.\n\n### EoM June 2024\n- First cohort of Owl Protocol chains’ mainnet deployment.\n- Metis blockchain testnet deployment.\n### July 2024\n- Metis blockchain mainnet deployment.\n- Smart Wallet SDK and UI components.\n\n\n## Summary\n**Owl Protocol aims to bring consumer dApps and web2 onboarding capabilities to the Metis ecosystem.**\n\nBuilding feature-rich web3 consumer applications (gaming, social) comparable to existing web2 platforms is inaccessible to most builders. Consumer DApps often have minimal on-chain features (eg. basic NFT) because existing developer platforms are limited, and smart contract code is difficult to upgrade.\n\nOwl Protocol allows businesses to quickly integrate web3 directly into their existing stack, improving the “time to ROI”, and providing incremental tangible improvements, rather than start from scratch with a PoC that is unlikely to impress stakeholders.\n\nThis grant and collaboration would make Metis an extremely attractive chain to develop and prove web 2.5 use cases and user onboarding. Also with the CEG program, projects already considering using Owl Protocol will be incentivized to bring their project to Metis.\n\nWebsite: [owlprotocol.xyz](owlprotocol.xyz)\nDocs: [docs.owl.build](docs.owl.build)",

      "title": "Ecosystem Proposal: 0xGasless Account Abstraction - Metis Integration partnership",
      "content": "### Greetings Metis Community,\n\nWe are thrilled to introduce 0xGasless, a state-of-the-art ERC 4337 compliant account abstraction SDK that is set to revolutionize the user experience on the Metis Andromeda chain. Our mission is to break down barriers to entry and make interacting with the Metis ecosystem seamless and accessible for all.\n\n## Introducing 0xGasless:\n\n0xGasless is a comprehensive account abstraction solution that includes a highly efficient bundler, a flexible paymaster, modular smart contract accounts, and an intuitive SDK to tie it all together. Our team has worked tirelessly to create a cost-effective and user-friendly solution that outperforms our competitors.\n\n### The 0xGasless Advantage:\n\n1. Efficiency and Cost-Effectiveness: Our optimized implementation of the ERC 4337 standard ensures that transactions are processed quickly and at a lower cost compared to other account abstraction solutions. This means users can enjoy a seamless experience without worrying about high gas fees.\n2. Flexible Paymaster: Our paymaster allows developers to customize gas payment strategies, enabling them to subsidize or completely cover gas fees for their users. This flexibility empowers developers to create unique user experiences tailored to their application’s needs.\n3. Modular Smart Contract Accounts: Our modular smart contract accounts provide developers with the tools to create feature-rich and customizable wallet experiences. From social logins to biometric authentication and session keys, developers can leverage our SDK to build wallets that cater to their users’ preferences.\n4. Seamless Integration: Integrating 0xGasless into your Metis-based application is a breeze. Our well-documented SDK and dedicated support team are here to assist developers every step of the way, ensuring a smooth integration process.**\n\n## Proposal for Metis Ecosystem:\n\n**We propose a strategic partnership between 0xGasless and the Metis ecosystem to bring the benefits of account abstraction to developers and users alike:**\n\n1. Invite new startups: We’ll funnel innovative projects into Metis: 0xGas labs incubated projects will receive guidance and support to launch on the Metis chain, unlocking their full potential.\n2. Integration Support: Our team will work closely with Metis-based projects to integrate 0xGasless into their applications. We will provide technical assistance, documentation, and resources to ensure a successful implementation.\n3. Co-Marketing Initiatives: We will collaborate with the Metis team and community to promote the adoption of account abstraction through joint AMAs, blog posts, and social media campaigns. Our aim is to educate developers and users about the benefits of 0xGasless and how it can enhance their experience on the Metis chain.\n4. Continuous Innovation: As the ERC 4337 standard evolves, we commit to staying at the forefront of account abstraction technology. We will actively contribute to the standard’s development and incorporate new features and improvements into 0xGasless, ensuring that Metis users always have access to the latest and greatest account abstraction solutions.\n\n## Measurable Milestones:\n\n1. Successful integration of 0xGasless into at least 5 Metis-based applications within the first 3 months of the partnership.\n2. Co-hosting 2 AMAs with the Metis team and community to raise awareness about account abstraction and 0xGasless.\n3. Achieving a 20% reduction in average gas costs for users interacting with 0xGasless-integrated applications compared to traditional wallet solutions.\n\n**We are excited about the potential of this partnership and the positive impact it will have on the Metis ecosystem. By combining our cutting-edge technology with Metis’s vibrant community and impressive DeFi capabilities, we can create a more inclusive and user-friendly environment for all.**\n\n**Thank you for considering our proposal. We look forward to working with the Metis team and community to bring the power of account abstraction to the masses.**\n\nBest regards,\nThe 0xGasless Team\n\nResources:\nWebsite: https://0xgasless.com\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/0xGasless\nDocs: https://docs.0xgasless.com",

LST platforms may submit proposals to Metis Governance Forum 12. A limited number of LST applicants will win the right to be paired with a decentralized sequencer node, opening up liquid staking to a pool of 20,000 to 100,000 METIS tokens per node.\n\nThis proposal aims to establish and communicate governance procedures related to the LSTs protocols.\n\n**LSTs**\n\nThe term “LST” derives from its inherently liquid characteristics, allowing users to stake their assets while maintaining flexibility in navigating the DeFi landscape and enabling opportunities for additional yield. This option is particularly appealing to those seeking alternative methods to generate returns on their assets without being bound by fixed lock periods as soon as the partial withdrawals mechanism is enabled (currently in testnet).\n\nMetis has set up a process in which node operators may be paired with Liquid Staking Tokens protocols, opening the door for the staked tokens to come from users. At this moment we foresee the following rounds of LST protocols onboarding:\n\n• Round 1 (Alpha launch) - to pair with the Metis Foundation sequencer nodes\n• Round 2 (Main launch) - to pair with the rest of the sequencers run by the community\n• Round X: Subsequent applications to become LST protocol\nUpon adding additional sequencers it is possible to execute additional rounds of LST protocol onboarding.\n\n**Round 1: Alpha launch (completed in March 2024)**\nMetis Foundation has facilitated the opening of 4 sequencer nodes, to ensure smooth transitions and network stability for Metis LST protocols.\nSelection of other nodes and 2 LST protocols occurred based on the outcome of the submitted community proposals: highest number of Metis votes received plus hitting quorum\n\n**Round 2: Main launch (to be completed in June 2024)**\nMetis Foundation will facilitate the opening of additional sequencer nodes to be paired with the LST protocols\nA governance process will occur whereby the passed proposals receiving the highest amount of METIS votes and quorum will have the opportunity to be paired with the sequencer node\n• Stage 1 - all potential LST protocols will submit their proposals on a Metis Governance Forum 12 and will be voted by the community\n• Stage 2 - The sequencer node provider will choose the qualified LST protocol which passed the voting and submit a Metis Governance Forum 12 announcement to notify the community about their decision and reasoning for that\n\n**Round X: Subsequent applications to become LST protocol**\nUpon sequencer nodes onboarding community may choose to open up external access to newly added sequencer nodes and in that case, steps listed in Round 2: Main launch will be repeated at the time of sequencer onboarding\n\n**Governance Procedures**\n\nThe following list of governance procedures covers a lifetime of the LST protocol - starting from proposing an LST protocol, covering onboarding, “offboarding” and situations leading to that.\n\n**Proposing a LST protocol**\n\nThe LST protocol will be proposed using the Metis Governance Forum 12. The proposal should be submitted using the Infrastructure proposals - LST 3 type. It will follow the process related to that type of proposal presented in the Governance Bluepaper - Roadmap (Governance (Proposal Types)). The proposal will be tagged as a “lst-protocol” proposal.\n\n**Voting procedures**\n\nVoting will happen on a Snapshot using the LST protocol Proposal suffix in the proposal’s subject. Only top LST protocols which satisfy below Voting criteria will be eligible for pairing with the Sequencer node.\n\n**Voting criteria**\n\nA quorum requirement of:\n• 20k METIS tokens\n• 500 or more wallet addresses participation\n• 80% or more approval vote to pass\n\n**Onboarding/Offboarding**\n\nOnboarding and offboarding requests will be made by the members of the community using the Metis Governance forum 12. Accepted proposals will be voted upon using the Snapshot voting platform. As described in the Community Proposal Voting Process Flow (metis.foundation) 1 the Governance Working Group will oversee Infrastructure proposals and reserve the right for the veto right on any Infrastructure proposals.\n\n**Onboarding**\n\nWhen reviewing the onboarding proposal, the primary evaluation criterion for the LST protocol candidate is the synergy between the sequencer node and the LST protocol. LST onboarding will occur in rounds, with the current round being Mainnet.\n\nEach submitted LST protocol proposal will undergo a vote. Qualified proposals will then be eligible for pairing with the sequencer node provider.\n\nAfter the voting is completed, the sequencer node will partner with the chosen LST protocol and submit an announcement to the Metis Governance Forum, informing the community about their decision and the reasoning behind it.\n\nLST protocols that are not selected initially do not need to resubmit their proposals; they will remain in the pool for subsequent rounds of pairing.\n\nOnboarding of the LST protocol includes the following steps:\n\n• Submit a CVP proposal to become a LST protocol on the Metis Governance forum 12 using Infrastructure proposal - LST 3 type\n• Template of the proposal\nTitle: LST protocol Proposal: [Project Name]\nExecutive Summary\nInformation about the project, total staked or locked assets, clients, etc.\nBackground and Integrations\nProtocol Stats\nProtocol Architecture\nStrategy\nToken Economy\nRewards Distribution\nBenefits for Community (optional)\nIntegration Roadmap\nOfficial Links: Website, Docs, Audits, etc.\nThe tag to be used is: lst-protocol\n• Discussion period - 2-4 weeks\n• Snapshot 14 proposal\n• Voting duration - 72 hours\n• Pass the vote\nSee Voting criteria above\n\n**Offboarding**\n\nGiven the inherent characteristics of LST implementation, it is not possible to “offboard” LST protocols once approved. A smart contract can be modified upon request to halt additional METIS deposits into the LST’s contract, but the automatic return of METIS already deposited into that contract is not programmatically achievable at the time of this proposal.\n\nAs new solutions become applicable to manage the potential risk posed by malicious LST protocols Metis team will evaluate their adoption into our ecosystem. It’s important to note that the risk associated with blockchain is public, and thus, the responsibility for mitigating this risk lies with the participants.\n\n**USE AT YOUR OWN RISK**",

OMO’s integration into the Metis ecosystem will allow Metis’ users to enjoy the unique cross-chain benefits offered by OMO based on Circle’s CCTP, such as highly capital-efficient liquidity pools,less attack vectors and more. What’s more, OMO’s advanced DEX aggregator can provide its users with advantageous prices, which enables members of Metis community to experience optimal trading prices and routes via the on-chain swap on Metis through OMO.\n\n## Introduction\nO3 Labs is a blockchain development collective, first launched in 2017. We’re continuously contributing to build the first ever cross-chain bridge and AMM aggregator solution where users could receive original digital assets, and O3 Labs products have been trusted by more than 200,000 users. In 2023, we launched the new product - OMO Swap.\n\n## Products\n\n**OMO Swap**\nOMO is a cross-chain aggregation protocol with no liquidity constraints and zero slippage. Users can execute ‘Orders Made Omnichain’ with limitless liquidity. It is also an innovative and open cross-chain solution. Users can do so via connection to a multitude of DEXs, achieving a one step cross-chain swap with a 0 slippage bridge at its center and highly efficient aggregated routes at its flanks.\n\n\n**Features:**\n\n- Zero-Slippage Bridge, Limitless Liquidity\nOMO was built on Circle’s CCTP, and it provides limitless $USDC liquidity with a 1:1 bridging mechanism. That’s why it was called a a zero-slippage, capital-efficient pathway.\n\n- Less Attack Vectors, Less Passive Pooling\nOMO has no liquidity stored in the bridge, which means there is no possibility that user tokens being hacked. The swaps route’s are provided by Dexs with audited smart contracts, so it’s an extremely light and flexible on-chain aggregator to activate liquidity.\n\n- All in One “Just go to Omo”\nOMO opens to developers building projects in DeFi (AMMs/NFT/Loan protocols/CEX) and anyone can integrate our SDK or API service for aggregation.\n\n## How do we support Metis?\nThrough aggregating top DEXs on Metis (eg. NetSwap) to activate liquidity, making the better use of capital. Users can seamlessly swap their digital assets with best prices and routes via OMO’s advanced aggregator!\n\nMarketing: Announcement would be posted on Twitter and our communities when OMO is launched on Metis.\n\n## Official Links: Website, Docs, Audits, Media, etc.\nhttps://app.omoswap.xyz/\nhttps://twitter.com/OMOSwapx\nhttps://docs.omoswap.xyz/",

      "content": "![5bad040745040f563ad2def03099d17284af37cb_2_690x388.jpg](ipfs://bafybeib6rwf5lmnakf3hl34yxp7x6dzmkkbg4vdquon3pv5lfchqrvprvi)\n    \n## Introduction\nThe goal of API3 is to provide developers with an easy way to access off-chain resources from within their smart contracts, without having to worry about security and trust implications. We believe DeFi and Web3 can change the financial landscape with the right infrastructure and access to meaningful real-world data.\n\n## Value Proposition\nAPI3 pioneered first-party oracles operated by data providers, removing the middleman and serving data directly to the chain. In price feeds, this means a collection of well-known data providers verifiably serves individual price updates to Metis, before being aggregated on-chain. In a first-party architecture, every data source can be verified, optimizing for transparency and increasing the security of a Price Oracle.\n\nBeyond providing next-generation Oracle technology, we focus on delivering a delightful developer experience, realized with the API3 Market. In the Market UI, price feeds can be activated and read in a permissionless fashion, with dAPIs being simple for developers to integrate.\n\nAlongside our price feeds, API3 also operates a public good Quantum RNG that provides ‘true’ entropy generated by quantum mechanics. API3 QRNG has dozens of NFT, gaming, lottery, and other types of dApps utilizing the oracle to deliver truly random outcomes.\n\nMoreover, API3 launched our decentralized price feeds in September 2023, and since then, we have grown our TVS to over $1 billion, with 25+ DeFi protocols integrated.\n\n## Uniqueness Factor\nAPI3’s OEV recapture solution, the OEV Network, will enable these protocols to recapture significant value by redirecting MEV currently leaked back to the protocol.\n\nExpanding on the above, Oracle Extractable Value (OEV) is a subset of Maximal Extractable Value (MEV) that occurs within on-chain liquidations. Currently, liquidations in lending markets are very inefficient, with significant amounts of collateral being passed to block producers (validators). The OEV Network is a solution that makes liquidations more efficient by using a dAPI price feed.\n\nThis means that, for the first time, protocols can generate value through their oracle. For larger lending markets, we estimate this equates to millions of dollars in value recapture per year, bringing significant benefits to this vertical within DeFi.\n\n## Benefits for Users\n- Transparent first-party price feeds provide improvements to transparency and security of an oracle\n- Permissionless access to price oracles through market.api3.org\n- Recapture OEV with zero further technical implementation to generate a new source of value accrual\n- Provision of builder tooling to utilize a REST API as an oracle for niche data feed requirements\n\n## Benefits for Metis Ecosystem\n- Additional of high quality infra to support the defi vertical\n- Developer engagement and support via API3 developer relations function to help builders execute\n- Support for price assets required in Metis enabling an ambitious defi strategy\n\n## Security/Audits\nAs an oracle we have undertaken many audits. You can see these in the API3 Github: [contracts/audit-reports at main](https://github.com/api3dao/contracts/tree/main/audit-reports) · [api3dao/contracts](https://github.com/api3dao/contracts/tree/main/audit-reports) · [GitHub](https://github.com/api3dao/contracts/tree/main/audit-reports)\n\n\n## Roadmap\nAPI3 has been building since late 2020. The majority of our whitepaper has been delivered, specifically our oracle node (Airnode), dAPI price feeds, and marketplace, all of which have been in production for several months. In the last six months, we optimized the data feed service and market experience for speed and scalability.\n\nSince late 2022, API3 has been working on our OEV recapture solution, known as the OEV Network. This is expected to go live in the near future.\n\nAfter this launch, API3 will be looking at enhancements to our data feeds, but this is still to be defined.\n\n## Summary\nAPI3 brings an enhanced oracle system to the Metis ecosystem, which, alongside serving price feeds, will allow DeFi protocols to recapture the thousands of dollars currently leaked to block builders through liquidation processes. This represents a new source of value accrual for DeFi builders in general, but specifically for lending and money markets.\n\n## Official Links: \nwww.api3.org 2\nwww.docs.api3.org\nwww.market.api3.org\nwww.ecosystem.api3.org\n[API3](https://github.com/api3dao) · [GitHub](https://github.com/api3dao)\ndiscord.gg/api3dao",

      "title": "Ecosystem Proposal: Cicero Finance",
      "content": "**Disclaimer**: This proposal has been shortened to fit Snapshot requirements, go to https://ceg.vote/t/cvp-proposal-cicero-finance/3344 to see full proposal. \n\n![image](ipfs://bafybeif5za6lp3m5nqwpcpw4bammisjsp2djzf252grat3v3aaozzefbai)\n\n## Capital Efficient Private Credit\nCicero is a contract-to-contract credit market for institutional borrowers. Our design will use a multiple pool approach to both mitigate risk and attract different lending appetites.\n\nOur core borrowers will be largely Web3 market makers, selected hedge funds as well off-chain opportunities such as property bonds (RWAs).\n\nAll governance decisions and underwriting will be made by staking Cicero. In addition to all governance decisions, staked Cicero can be used to reback loans in the event of defaults. To avoid governance manipulation, we will make sure of depreciating voting power (the closer you are to unstaking, the less voting power your tokens hold).\n\n\n## Mission\nCicero aims to be the destination for on-chain for institutional Web3 borrowing.\n\nOur initial borrowers will be major market makers and select hedge funds.\n\nIn this model, many can lend but only few institutions can borrow.\n\nLess counterparty risk means that lenders and token holders can have a more detailed understanding of the parties borrowing, and with this more peace of mind on how borrowed funds will be deployed.\n\nBy having multiple pools (senior and junior), lenders can deploy strategies to optimise yields based on individual risk tolerance.\n\n \n![image](ipfs://bafybeiaplr3coifh7atsr5mvrxta56rkvp4tmrfhr57juoniezbbgnha7i)\n\n## The Importance of Capital Efficiency\n\nThe ability to lend and borrow assets is a cornerstone of any financial system.\n\nAlthough overcollateralized lending is safer for the lender, it is not as capital efficient and thus limits market expansion.\n\nIn a nascent industry such as Web3/DeFi this ability to access capital is even more important so that the critical financial plumbing such as exchanges, OTC desks, and other brokerage models have the required liquidity for the market to function optimally.\n\nThese are all benefits on the borrow side, but under-collateralized models also have many benefits on the lend side as well, namely through attractive yields.\n\nDue to the fact that under-collateralized loans are a higher risk to lenders than over-collateralized models such as Aave/Compound they also justifiably offer a higher Annual Percentage Yield (APY) return on deposit.\n\nThe market rates for capital fluctuate based on market cycles, but are always attractive, especially so when there is a higher demand for working capital such as during periods of market optimism.\n\nBy judiciously lending to only the most robust businesses in the industry, LPs get the advantage of higher yields, with the added benefit of knowing they are only lending to a very select group of well-established borrowers. This does not guarantee that loans will not default, but it does limit the amount of counterparties that lenders need to monitor and track repayments. \n![image](ipfs://bafkreid2dzxslbmxjsgu6ngxsx34rlmdb2qtzzlkx56hg6pdjblhtkrlym)\n \n![image](ipfs://bafybeicy4rw7ineodbvwm5e64z3fbuqoeeneg5tz2jcdn7fesrvyyrlhsm)\n\n## Assessing risk\n\nCicero will work with trusted third parties to generate comprehensive on-chain credit scores and analysis.\n\nTrustworthy creditworthiness data is used to estimate risk profiles of borrowers without disclosing sensitive information on blockchains.\n\nAt the outset loans will be approved by the core team to create initial flows and prove the model, however as we move towards true decentralization credit committees and allocators will be selected and made up from the staking pool.\n\nModels that require a third party to approve loans can work, and do work, but without adequate financial penalty for defaults the incentive is almost always to approve loans.\n\nWe believe that a model where the users who are putting up the capital, can decide whether to fund or reject applications creates the right set of incentives to adequately underwrite loans, with the added benefits of keeping this value in the system (fees go to users, rather than an outside organisation).\n\nOf course, no underwriting is perfect and defaults do occur - however having an extremely high bar to who Cicero will onboard as borrowers and with the protocol lenders can both select and use modular risk management when deciding how to allocate funds.\n\n## A post FTX / Voyager World\n\nTo address the elephant in the room, there may be some concerns around the sustainability of undercollateralized models due to fallouts and full collapses of Voyager, Celsius and Three Arrows Capital in the previous cycle which created enormous contagion across the interlinked crypto credit markets.\n\nWhile these are valid concerns for all undercollateralized markets, we only need to look at the fact that the private credit market hit 2.1T globally in assets and committed value. This figure is larger than the entire crypto market by some margin.\n\nThis comparison to legacy markets implies an enormous growth potential for currently nascent under collateralized lending in Web3, where unsecured markets are a mainstay across all financial product segments.\n\nAs previously stated, capital efficiency is a core tenet to expanding markets, and when allocated correctly an extremely powerful instrument in any financial market.\n\n![image](ipfs://bafybeihbmfj5mugw6nzeo33enyv7xrds4vbfioxilb5cxcozavpudgguvu)\n\n## More than Governance - Value Accrual of Cicero Token\n\nThe critical role of the Cicero token will be work as backstop for the senior pool in the event of liquidations (when Cicero is staked). However incentives drive all human behaviour, and in order to create a sustainable protocol we must ensure that value is accrued and distributed back to the token holders.\n\nValue Accrual is the process by which a token ecosystem creates and maintains demand over time, while transforming that demand into captured value retained by token holders. Demand is always the precursor to value (no matter what anyone says).\n\nMost projects promise a design solution that achieves this, but very few actually deliver on promise.\n\nA multitude of value accrual mechanisms exist, however only those that directly distribute value back to the token holders offer any truly tangible benefit. We are acutely aware of this problem within token design, and have taken steps to ensure that value is not only captured, but distributed to those who help the protocol function (liquidity, staking, governance, approving loans, etc).\n\nThe simple truth is that in order for a protocol to accrue value it must have demand for the service, and then divert some of that value to the protocol and in turn the token holders.\n\n### The value accrual properties of Cicero will be the function of three inputs:\n\n1. Real yield (repayments)\n2. Token buy-backs (buy pressure)\n3. Claimable fees (in ETH)\n\n\n## Real-yield (loan repayments)\n\nIt feels ridiculous to write this, but given that DeFi was originally dominated by frothy yield farms and food tokens, profitable protocols distributing organic revenue to token holders (such as GMX) have become increasingly popular.\n\nThe obvious benefit of money markets are that they generally always have borrow side demand, and that so long as the allocators are doing are good job, then the protocol captures revenue from monthly repayments.\n\nCicero has both a senior pool and a junior pool, where the senior pool is safer and the junior pools works are first loss capital. The yield for the LPs is reflected in the risk taken (so the junior pool earns more USDC and Cicero).\n\nNative tokens can be used as an added incentive to increased yield and incentivize behaviour, but are non-essential to generating revenue.\n\nTokens are not necessary to create revenue, but they are an important tool to help the protocol reach velocity (in both sides of the loan book).\n\n## Claimable fees (in ETH)\n\nFees captured and held in treasury can be distributed to token stakers once above a certain threshold, and agreed to by stakers. In order to minimise inflation of the token, users can claim the fees in ETH, so as to not put counter-productive selling pressure on the protocol (this would be the opposite of value accrual, where value is actually being extracted from this system. This is a similar design to what GMX made so popular.\n\n## Request for CVP Status\n\nGiven our innovative and methodical approach to Defi on Metis, adherence to security best practices and commitment to community engagement, we propose that Cicero be granted Community Verified Project status. This recognition will not only validate the work we have already done, but it will help bring further visibility to the project as we settle on a destination on where to launch our protocol. Having this surety allows us to focus on the next steps of go to the market, and in turn look to bring more activity to the Metis ecosystem.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nCapital efficiency is paramount to any financial market’s ability to expand and work optimally.\n\n**-no underwriting is perfect, however creating the right incentives and equally disincentives should ensure that not only is allocation cautious, but also that the fees generated for approving loans is retained by participants in the protocol.**\n**-The beauty of money markets is that they generate real yield immediately, and should always have borrow side demand. In a healthy money market, demand should outstrip supply.**\n**-Taking appropriate care towards token accrual design is vitally important, however no amount of mechanism design can create and maintain token appreciation on its own.**\n**-The only way to achieve this is to have a product that has genuine demand, which then captures value and distributes it to its token holders.**\n**-We believe we have achieved these steps through meticulous planning and we now hope to work with the Metis community to help launch the product.**",

      "title": "Ecosystem Proposal: Metis Gas Station",
      "content": "Metis Gas Station 5 abstracts the process of paying for gas away from end users which minimizes UX friction for dApps. With GSN, gasless clients can interact with Metis smart contracts without users needing METIS for transaction fees.\n\nThis is an integration of the open-source project Ethereum Gas Station Network (GSN) to Metis L2.\n\nWe provide maintenance as well as developer support to let Metis builders have control over their abstraction tooling.\n\nWhat gives Metis Gas Station to a user?\n\nIndirect gas payment: Enabling gas-less operations for users in dApps.\n\nPay for gas in custom tokens: Allow users to pay for gas in non-native tokens.\n\nPay for gas off-chain: Allow users to pay for gas indirectly via a rollup or a credit card.\n\nProblem Statement\nWithout GSN, anyone who sends a transaction needs to have METIS to pay for gas fees. This forces new users to pass KYC and purchase the token before they can start using any dApp. This can be a major hurdle for users without prior crypto experience that are unfamiliar with the concept of needing to keep METIS in their wallet for gas.\n\nKey Features\nThere are a lot of other paymaster and account abstraction options on the market, but they have few major flaws.\n\nDevelopers are fully dependent on third-party hosting, paying extra fees and bound to only one relay option.\nOpenGSN, on the other hand, lets builders maintain and configure their own paymasters with ease.\n\nUsually these services contain heavy centralized parts and are solely hosted by one party.\nGas Station Network runs fully decentralized, and intensifies healthy market concurrency, by letting anyone provide paymaster services for a profit in a secure manner. There is no single point of failure.\n\nThis technology is being used throughout the Web3 world on most of the major EVM chains.\n\nClick here to see the status of all on-chain relayers. For example, here is a OpenGSN Paymaster that conducted more than 11,000 transactions alone.\n\nWe believe that Metis L2 will benefit greatly by bringing OpenGSN and helping founders adopt it.",

      "title": "Infrastructure - LST Proposal: Request for Additional Sequencer Node for Artemis Finance",
      "content": "## Abstract\n\nThis proposal seeks to address the growing demand for METIS staking and participation in the decentralized sequencer by requesting the addition of a second sequencer node for Artemis Finance. As the community's interest in staking METIS continues to rise, reaching the lock-up cap of 100,000 METIS for the designated sequencer node, it is crucial to accommodate the increasing staking requests from the community.\n\n## Proposal\n\nWe hereby submit this proposal to request the establishment of an additional Sequencer Node to meet the staking demands of the community after we reach the 100,000 METIS sequencer lock-up cap. This decision aims to bring numerous benefits to the METIS ecosystem:\n\n1. Expanded Participation: By adding another Sequencer Node, we can extend the opportunity for more METIS holders to participate in the industry's first Decentralized Sequencer and share in the staking rewards.\n\n2. Attraction of Non-METIS Users: The introduction of a second Sequencer Node will create a yield opportunity that can attract non-METIS users to join the Metis ecosystem and hold artMETIS, thereby expanding the community and fostering growth.\n\n3. Enhanced Security: Increasing the staked METIS amount through an additional Sequencer Node will strengthen the security threshold of the Decentralized Sequencer network, ensuring a more robust and resilient infrastructure.\n\n4. Stimulating On-chain Activity: The inclusion of more assets within the Metis ecosystem will further stimulate on-chain activity, driving engagement and promoting the overall development of the network.\n\nWe acknowledge concerns regarding centralization during the initial stages of the Decentralized Sequencer. It is important to note that the limited number of nodes available to the METIS Foundation and its closest partners is a temporary measure. Moving forward, we are committed to actively collaborating with multiple Sequencer node operators to disperse Artemis staked METIS and maintain the decentralization of the Sequencer network.\n\nWe invite the community's support and engagement in this proposal, as it will shape the future of METIS staking and contribute to the continued growth and resilience of the Metis ecosystem.\n\n## About Artemis Finance\n\nArtemis Finance is a liquid staking protocol exclusively designed for Metis Decentralized Sequencer Pools. Through Artemis Finance, METIS holders can stake their tokens and receive artMETIS, a liquid wrapper that automatically accumulates earnings. This streamlined approach simplifies the staking process and fosters a robust DeFi usage scenario.\n\nFor more information, please refer to [LSD Proposal - Artemis](https://ceg.vote/t/lsd-proposal-artemis/1693).\n\n## Key Stats\n\nDuring the past two months since the launch of Artemis, the protocol has achieved significant milestones:\n\n* Total staked amount: 125,826 METIS\n* artMETIS mint times: 37,000\n* TVL rank: 3rd in the Metis ecosystem ( https://defillama.com/chain/Metis )\n\nArtemis has effectively attracted TVL to various partners, including:\n\n* Hercules Exchange: $1,660,000 (artMETIS/METIS)\n* Shoebill Finance: $1,610,000 (artMETIS market)\n* Vector Finance: $450,000\n\nThese achievements underline the growing interest and trust in Artemis Finance as a reliable platform for METIS liquid staking.",

      "title": "Ecosystem Proposal: Router Protocol | Chain Abstraction - Zero TVL Intents based bridging",
      "content": "**Router Protocol Description**\n\nRouter Protocol is a PoS based Layer-1 blockchain that empowers developers to build intent-based modular interoperability solutions within a robust, secure and decentralised environment. Router Nitro, first flagship dApp built on Router Chain, is the most gas-optimised (50-70% cheaper vs Satellite/Squid, Wormhole/Portal & Stargate), highly capital-efficient and fast asset bridge (<20 sec) powered by Router’s innovative reverse-verification flow.\n\n**Team Members and Roles**\n\n* Ramani Ramachandran (CEO)\n* Shubham Singh (Co-founder & CTO)\n* Priyeshu Garg (Head of Research and Devrel)\n* Abhishek Somani (Head of Product)\n* Mankena Venkatesh (Blockchain Engineer)\n\n**Router Nitro product features**\n\n**Zero-TVL Intent-Based Asset Transfers**: Uses Optimistic approach to execute the transaction & a reverse verification module using Router Chain’s Stateful bridging & Contract level integration modules.\n\n \n![Screen1.png](ipfs://bafkreicknpus6qpkbcrptisyloa6xscivhfv5q4y5u3jwbppcwvvqf6w3a)\n    \n\nIntroduces an entity (forwarder or solver) to front the liquidity on the destination chain. The forwarder then reconciles their funds post verification, referencing the expected transaction on the Router’s middleware contract.\n\n**Open Network:** joining the forwarder network is open and permissionless\n\n**Fast Transfers:** most bridge transfers could be completed under 20 seconds\n\n**Capital Efficiency:** The forwarders need not lock any capital in Router smart contracts and the liquidity could be actively managed.\n\n**Security:** As a layer 1 Proof of Stake (PoS) blockchain, the Router chain is primarily run by a network of independent validators with economic incentives to act honestly.\n\n**Unparalleled Gas Efficiency:** We've managed to achieve over 50% gas savings compared to peers like Stargate, Wormhole, and Axelar.\n\n**Quick Stats:** Router Nitro public mainnet went live on 25 January 2024.\n\n**Protocol volume in last 30d:** ~$118M\n\n**Protocol txns in last 30d:** ~196k TXs\n\n**Number of chains connected:** 16\n\n**Analytics Dashboard Link:** https://explorer.routernitro.com/analytics\n\n**Website:** https://www.routerprotocol.com/\n\n**GitHub:** https://github.com/router-protocol\n\n**Twitter:** https://twitter.com/routerprotocol\n\n**Router Nitro Whitepaper:** https://www.routerprotocol.com/router-nitro-whitepaper.pdf\n\n**Audits:**\n\nhttps://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1YWw0aEVV7x1AG7IdiWzjAQnD35hsWeNs?usp=drive_link\n\nhttps://drive.google.com/drive/folders/10BcXJD3CPKvQb-rPplkiAPKWTqHWVlSE?usp=drive_link\n\n**Router CCIF**\n\nRouter CCIF is an Intent based Framework that employs a combination of Router’s Intent Adapter (think smart contracts) that abstract complex actions of multiple Dapps for the user and enable intuitive and efficient workflows that are executed in a click of a button.\n\nAs an example, consider a user who has 123 ETH on a source chain (say Ethereum) and wants to provide ETHx/ETH LP on Uniswap v3 on a destination chain (say Metis). As shown in the diagram below, Router CCIF employs Stader Adapter and Uni V3 Pool Adapter that can execute this complex set of actions in a single click.\n\n \n![Screen2.png](ipfs://bafkreif74h7fxbmvghwd2hhjapm37wnkrryaplu5r5htpioztvosuuuomu)\n    \n\nRouter CCIF with its intent adapters enables applications to execute any executable combination of workflows such as:\n\n1) Swap + Bridge (to Metis) + Swap + Add Liquidity\n\n2) Swap + Bridge (to Metis) + Add Liquidity + Stake\n\n3) Swap + Bridge (to Metis) + Liquid Stake\n\n*This flow is completely trustless and similar to how a user would usually execute this entire process with a difference that this is done by a third party solver/forwarder and the entire ownership of the underlying asset/LP is returned to the user in a single click within seconds.*\n\n**Router CCIF detailed Whitepaper:** [Router Cross-chain Intent Framework](https://www.routerprotocol.com/router-ccif-whitepaper.pdf)\n\n**Router Nitro Bridge Security**\n\nRouter has been amongst a handful of bridges which has largely remained immune from any hacks in the past. The points below illustrate the strengths of Router compared to its competitors:\n\n1. The funds of the users are almost never at risk because Router Nitro does not issue wrapped assets and the risk of settlement is borne by third-party market-makers/solver entities we call “forwarders” and not by the users.\n\n2. Router Nitro’s security model is built to minimise loss in case there is a hack. This is because at any point in time, the system has minimal locked TVL that sits in EOAs of active market-makers/solvers called forwarders.\n\n3. In order to further combat the situation where a specific chain undergoes a 51% attack or the native or related bridge of the chain itself gets hacked, we have also introduced a feature called “Community Glass Switch”. In this feature, any community member can pause the bridge by adding native tokens of the chain as a bond to make a claim that the specific chain in question should be paused to prevent damage.\n\n**Value Add/Advantages for Metis**\n\nOur novelty lies in providing the fastest and most seamless onboarding to Metis- we are the fastest bridge existing today for cross-chain transfers on a majority of chains. In order to improve user experience, we have taken a step further and implemented industry's first fully functioning intents framework “CCIF framework” that can enable full-fledged end to end execution for users coming to Metis in a single click. Further, Router Protocol will deploy its own incentives to accelerate TVL inflow into Metis chain. We intend to use “Carrots” in conjunction with any incentives we receive from Metis to supercharge transition of users to Metis and reduce friction in onboarding to Metis.\n\nThese points are explained in more detail below:\n\n* **Using Router Nitro, users can bridge funds to Metis in 5-20 seconds at a cost which is a fraction of what it would usually take compared to other bridges**. Nitro enables this via its zero TVL Intent based transfers. The risk of settlement, is therefore, completely shifted from users and borne by these active liquidity manager entities called forwarders who later submit a cryptographic proof referencing the completed transaction on the Router’s middleware contract to claim the bridged funds.\n\n* **Router CCIF is the industry first working and fully implemented cross-chain intents framework that allows applications to onboard users via a single click.** Unlike other bridge aggregators or bridges that are dependent upon external partners to enable one-click onboarding, Router’s CCIF framework can provide the complete one-click onboarding functionality end-to-end. This is done with its in-house built (and fully audited) intent adapters. Using these adapters, any application on Metis can allow users to invoke actions on its smart contracts via a single-click.\n\n* **Further, we will be implementing a special campaign for Metis users where users onboarding into Metis from other L2s/L1s will receive accelerated 3X Carrot rewards**.\n\nNote: *Carrot rewards are a form of points similar to EL Points or Kelp Miles as an incentive for users utilising Router Nitro. Tangible value of carrots are captured by multiple means:*\n\n*1. Evolution of Rabbit NFTs*\n\n*2. Future airdrops by Router ecosystem projects (StakeEase, FolioX, Lendara etc.)*\n\n*3. Tickets to win a lottery pool that is funded by a portion of weekly fees generated by the bridge*",

      "title": "Ecosystem Proposal: DAOstar | Standards & Public Goods for DAOs",
      "content": "### Summary\n\nDAOstar is the standards body for DAOs. We are a non-profit organization that builds public goods and infrastructure. We are excited about the prospect of becoming a Community Verified Project (CVP) on Metis and helping nurture its DAO ecosystem.\n\nOur first initiative in the Metis ecosystem will be centered around EIP-4824, the DAO metadata standard adopted by Snapshot, Aragon, Treasure, 1inch, etc. We will ensure that DAOs on Metis L2 have the necessary handrails required to understand and adopt the standard, thus improving the state of the DAO ecosystem on Metis.\n\n### Introduction\n\nDAOstar is a non-profit, public goods project. We are supported by the Ethereum Foundation, Optimism Collective, Arbitrum Foundation, ENS DAO, Gnosis, and several other prominent web3 organizations. At present, the DAOstar One Roundtable has [90 member organizations](https://daostar.one/).\n\nDAOstar is led by Joshua Tan, mathematician & computer scientist from Oxford; Eugene Levanthal, the present Executive Director of Metagov; and Amandeep, previously associated with DeepDAO and holding a B.Tech in Physics from IIT Delhi.\n\n### Value Proposition\n\nDAOstar exists to support DAO innovation. We offer a platform for all DAO builders to come together to hack on public infrastructure. At present, we have 7 working groups tackling important problems:\n\n|Working Group|Description|Members|\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|DAO* Delegations|Defining contracts and schemas for an on-chain delegate registry|Karma, Tally, Optimism, Uniswap, Agora|\n|Grants Innovation Lab|Conducts research, standards development, and building a community to create actionable advances for grant programs|Gitcoin, Optimism, OpenQ, DaoLens, kycDAO, Solana; led by Eugene Leventhal|\n|DAO* Attestations|Building an interoperable attestations system for DAOs and DAO tooling|Avenue, Govrn, Disco|\n|DAO* Regulatory Interoperability|Defining a regulatory API. The plan is to eventually transition into a working group on tax standards.|Joni Pirovich, Joshua Tan, Primavera De Filippi, Ori Shimony, Jake Hartnell|\n|DAO* Governor Ecosystem Standards|Supporting technical developments in the Governor Ecosystem|Tally, Scopelift, OpenZeppelin, Nouns, JokeDAO|\n|DAO* Strike Team|Development and maintenance of EIP-4824 / DAOIP-2|Issac Patka, Joshua Tan, Michael Zargham, Eyal Eithcowich, Ido Gershtein Sam Furter, Drew MacArthur|\n|DAO* Proposal Types|Standard templates for DAO proposals|Aragon, Commonwealth, CharmVerse, Metagov, Cultur3|\n\nDAOstar has published five standards, with two additional standards planned for release in Q2 2024. Having successfully developed these standards and facilitated the formation of exceptional working groups, we are more convinced than ever of the collaborative nature inherent in the DAO ecosystem. The biggest value DAOstar offers is a space where competition takes a backseat, allowing participants to embrace their builder mindset and hack together on critical public infrastructure.\n\nWith the community's support, we aim to bring the same spirit of collaborative innovation to the Metis ecosystem. We look forward to the MetisDAO as well as other organizations from the ecosystem joining the DAOstar One roundtable.\n\n### Uniqueness Factor\n\nBenefits for Users\n\nThe biggest benefits to end-users from our work are the impact our standards and infrastructure have on bettering the ecosystem. To give some specific examples:\n\n* EIP-4824 increases the transparency of DAOs. This means that it makes it easier for the end user to access information and participate in more DAOs.\n* The attestation standard creates a highly interoperable attestation ecosystem. With this, credentials and attestations earned by the end user from various attestation issuers, and DAOs, will be interoperable with each other. This makes sure that their contributions across the ecosystem are valued.\n* The grants metadata standard makes it easy to apply to new grants and to prove participation in other grant programs. This helps builders build a legitimate track record.\n\nBenefits for Metis Ecosystem\n\nThe biggest benefit for the ecosystem will be that MetisDAO, as well as other organizations in the Metis ecosystem will be able to join the DAOstar One roundtable and work together with the rest of the industry on important problems concerning DAOs. As for how specific standards positively impact the Metis ecosystem, here are a few examples:\n\n* EIP-4824 will increase the transparency, interoperability and discoverability of the DAO ecosystem on Metis. As daoURI defines a global format for publishing data on-chain, DAOs on Metis will enjoy the same level of discoverability as DAOs on Ethereum mainnet and other layer 2s.\n\n* EIP-4824 provides a base layer for building more public infrastructure. It is presently being used to build an opt-in Regulatory Interface and Tax Standard for DAOs, and a Grants Management Standard. In short, EIP-4824 will lead to long term value accrual for Metis.\n\n* The Grants Innovation Lab produces research, schemas and KPIs that will improve the state of grants at Metis. Similarly, our work around attestations and delegation will catalyze growth in the respective sectors in Metis.\n\n### Summary\n\nIn summary, DAOstar is deeply committed to enhancing the DAO ecosystem on Metis. We will accomplish this by authoring standards, maintaining public infrastructure, and providing a powerful seat at the table for DAO builders from the Metis ecosystem.\n\nWe look forward to your feedback and support, as well as being an impactful contributor to the Metis ecosystem by becoming a Community Verified Project.\n\n### Official Links\n\nWebsite: https://daostar.org/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/DAOstar_One\nDocs: https://docs.daostar.org/\nDAOstar One: https://daostar.one/\nDAOIPs: https://github.com/metagov/daostar/tree/main/DAOIPs\nHow to adopt EIP-4824: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OtvSegQKvU&t=3s",

Growing Metis’ trader base,\n2. Enabling traders using dApps in the Metis ecosystem with safe cross-chain swaps,\n3. Making Metis ecosystem more simple to use – hence more competitive.\n4. Optional new revenue stream for Metis (swap fees).\n\nXSwap’s utility is adding cross-chain capabilities to swaps, marketplaces, lending, staking protocols, iGaming, or other processes related to the trader experience.\n\nInstead of doing a swap, a bridge, and then staking/lending/buying, users do everything in one click, increasing the project's conversion (trade-made) rates.\n\n## What’s in it for Metis?\n\nProjects building on Metis, who opt-in for the cross-chain swaps, would note shorter user conversion cycles, as conversions would require fewer operations – it’d be easier to make a transaction from/to other chains.\n\nOptionally, they’d also be able to include a swapping/bridging fee that’d go to their treasury and use their own liquidity if it’s a DEX.\n\n### Metis x XSwap proposed action plan\n\n1. Co-marketing campaign in April, so Metis gets maximum exposure to new traders and the Chainlink ecosystem, as XSwap is preparing an Ape Terminal IDO, with growing marketing reach.\nThis would include posts on each project’s channels.\n\n2. Once Metis’ integration into CCIP is completed, XSwap will onboard Metis to its swap, making its L2 available to be cross-chain swapped/bridged to.\nThis will be complemented by more joint marketing and PR efforts to attract more builders and traders to the Metis ecosystem.\n\nAlong with incentivized user-activation efforts, such as a trading competition or bridging incentives – the exact scope would be agreed upon once the technical integration is operational.\n\n3. Potential further technical collaborations with Metis Ecosystem projects.\n\n**Due Diligence on XSwap**\n\nXSwap was the first project to participate in Chainlink’s BUIDL incubation program, and the first cross-chain swap ever deployed on Chainlink’s major product, the Cross Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP).\n\nIt’s set for an IDO on Ape Terminal in April, with a self-serve SDK launch in May.\n\n* 80,000+ Total audience\n* 250+ Onboarded Key Opinion Leaders\n* 12 VC investments\n* $3,000,000+ Daily Volume\n* 50,000+ Connected wallets\n\n**Links**\n\nhttps://xswap.link/\n\nhttps://docs.xswap.link/xswap\n\nhttps://twitter.com/xswap_link\n\nhttps://blog.xswap.link/",

      "title": "Ecosystem Proposal: Cede.store x Metis - Co-Marketing & Incentive Campaign",
      "content": "Gabriel here, co-founder & COO of cede.store, the first non-custodial CEX on-ramp solution for DeFi apps\n\n## Introduction\n\n- Right now, you have 3 ways to onboard liquidity:\n    - Use a bridge\n        - few solutions (especially for non-EVMs)\n        - slow, high gas fees\n        - smart contract risks\n        - only for assets already on-chain\n    - Use a FIAT on-ramp\n        - custodial\n        - need to do a new KYC\n        - high fees (2%-5%)\n        - → target newbies that bring only small liquidity (not making a chain’s TVL or volume)\n    - Withdraw from a CEX\n        - we know the majority of the crypto liquidity is within CEX\n        - almost all DeFi users have a CEX\n        - users have liquidity already onboarded on CEX that is never “working”\n        - CEX also provides access to far more networks than all on-chain bridges\n    - So on the most relevant entry point to DeFi, there’s no solution to facilitate CEX to blockchain transfers\n        - **That’s where we enter the game**\n\n## Value Proposition\n\n- Cede.store is the first non-custodial CEX on-ramp solution for any dApp/chain foundation/browser wallet.\n- The goal is to help any player incentivize their users to transfer their CEX assets to DeFi.\n\n- We can do that because we can pseudo-anonymously associate CEX accounts with a DeFi address, therefore, we can reward a user on-chain for off-chain actions.\nIdentify which DeFi users deposited assets on which network, from which CEX, which tokens, and which quantity will allow our partner to design fully personalized and accurate incentive campaigns, by rewarding the users who deserve it the most: the ones bringing real liquidity, that wasn't on Metis ecosystem yet. \n\nThe idea would be to run incentive program campaigns to reward users when they move liquidity from CEX into the Metis ecosystem!\n\n**[Metis <> Cede.store video demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WuVtet6Vr0&ab_channel=CedeLabs)**\n\n- Users can currently transfer from Binance, Gateio, OKX & Bitget to Metis using cede.store\n\n- Feel free to explore our Presentation Deck (available [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1fFrjGozRRZbMHPQDJoPjpKsabK0L73XTXjVPHYRIrpE/edit?usp=sharing) & at the end of the proposal) to get some examples regarding our previous campaigns. \n\n## Uniqueness Factor\n\n- A dApp can keep the whole user experience within its interface for a transfer from CEX to Metis.\n- The user doesn’t have to open his CEX interface and worry about copy-pasting the right destination address.\n- In addition to that, we stay fully non-custodial because the CEX access keys of the users stay within the device of the user to comply with DeFi values.\n\n## Benefits for Users\n\n- A quicker & cheaper way to fund his wallet\n- After partnering with Metis Foundation and potentially dApps building on Metis Ecosystem, benefit from rewards through incentive campaigns! The more you transfer from CEX to Metis, (and potentially to the dApp integrating our widget), the more rewards you will earn\n- Start earning exclusive rewards from our partners and be ready for a specific reward program launch on Cede's side...\n\n## Benefits for Metis Ecosystem\n\n- Cover the privileged liquidity entry point to Metis and bring new liquidity on-chain that would otherwise probably stay in CEX\n\n## Media\n- Twitter: https://twitter.com/cedelabs\n\n* All our social links: https://linktr.ee/cede_labs\n\n## Roadmap\nAs mentioned, Metis is now natively supported in cede.store extension. \nWe are happy to explore other additions if the proposal is approved and explore specific grant opportunities. \n\n## Summary\n\nCede.store is a browser extension that allows users to interact with their CEX assets on any dApp while keeping DeFi values of self-custody and wallet UX. \nThe goal is to help Metis ecosystem, which means any dApps, wallet or projects seeking for more liquidity, users or trading volume, to incentivize their users to transfer their CeFi assets to on-chain.\n\nThe idea would be to run some incentive program campaigns to reward users when they move liquidity from CEX into Metis  ecosystem, as we can track and share this data with you (which CEX, which amount and to which DeFi address)\n\nTo clarify where cede.store stands on the ecosystem, have a look to the following diagram: \n\n \n![ae555672c53e29b59f5f6ab282a6511d08f84feb_2_690x385.png](ipfs://bafybeidewu6drlegzomlzcfzn3k5fdof75vkeuxhpkmxajdqssrqncwbyi)\n    \n\n\n## Official Links: Website, Docs, Audits, etc.\n- Website: https://cede.store\n- Docs: https://docs.cede.store\n- Audits (Pen test with Hacken, we've got 10/10 security grade): https://github.com/cedelabs/cede.store/blob/main/Cede%20Labs%20PT%20Complete%20Report.pdf\n\n\n## Additional information: \n\n- Presentation Deck Metis <> Cede.store: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1fFrjGozRRZbMHPQDJoPjpKsabK0L73XTXjVPHYRIrpE/edit?usp=sharing\n\n- Current metrics (in total, with all of our supported ecosystems):\n  - 24 partners (Beginning of January: 6 partners)\n  - $2.5M total transferred (Beginning of January: $0)\n  - 1450 users (Beginning of January: 371 users)",

      "title": "Ecosystem Proposal: Blocklive | Live Events on Metis",
      "content": "### Introduction Value\nBlocklive is a platform for end-to-end onchain event management and ticketing. We embrace proof of history as a way for organizers to target and reward fans. We want to create the most powerful decentralized graph of real world human interaction.\n\n\n### Value Proposition\nOn-chain tickets, as facilitated by Blocklive, unlock capabilities far beyond the reach of traditional web2 platforms. They provide a permissionless, immutable record of a user's engagement with events, creating a digital footprint of their real-world interactions. This not only enriches the user's experience within our platform but also opens up expansive possibilities for engagement and personalization beyond it. Imagine a world where attending an event leaves a mark that could later tailor experiences, offers, and interactions in entirely new ways.\n\nThis transformation extends to artists and event organizers as well, who can leverage this data to forge deeper connections and understandings with their communities. The granularity and authenticity of onchain attendance records promise to redefine how relationships between creators and their audiences are built.\n\nBlocklive's approach turns each ticket into a composable building block for the broader ecosystem. Without needing direct coordination, a merchandise vendor could verify event attendance to offer exclusive products, or a game developer could reward players based on their real-world engagement. This seamless interoperability, powered by onchain data, paves the way for new ways to integrate between applications, setting a new standard for how we interact with the real and digital worlds.\n\nBlocklive isn't just introducing a new way to ticket events - it's unlocking a paradigm shift in how we record, interact with, and derive value from our real-world experiences through the power of blockchain.\n\n \n![6812f2d1172db970cf9284e757fd658540a5cff5.jpeg](ipfs://bafybeia2wudjy2ywjgl4on3pumbss5lho7ym2fshhfdrysnlve57actnbe)\n    \n\n### Uniqueness Factor\nDespite numerous attempts to revolutionize on-chain ticketing, success has remained elusive—until now. Blocklive stands apart by achieving what others couldn't: merging the high-quality experience event organizers and attendees demand with the innovative use of blockchain for ticketing. This combination has long been sought in the blockchain community but has yet to be realized, until Blocklive.\n\nBlocklive is the only platform that allows event attendees to RSVP or purchase tickets with a frictionless web2 flow, while behind the scenes, creating wallets and executing onchain transactions to airdrop tickets to users. We get the best of web2 and web3 and a mechanism to onboard millions of event attendees onchian.\n\n\n### Benefits for Users\nBlocklive revolutionizes the event experience for two primary stakeholders: the attendees and the organizers.\n\nAttendees of conventional ticketing services like Ticketmaster or Eventbrite experience events as fleeting moments. Once the event concludes, the only remnants are receipts or QR codes buried in email inboxes. Blocklive transforms these ephemeral tokens into lasting digital assets, converting what was once a simple email receipt into a permanent, brag-worthy record on the blockchain. More significant than the prestige of collecting these records is the opportunity for attendees to earn rewards based on their participation. This system enables access to future benefits and experiences that were previously inaccessible, enriching the event-going journey beyond the physical attendance of events.\n\nFor event organizers, the traditional toolkit for audience engagement has been decidedly narrow, often limited to generic email communications to past event attendees. Blocklive's on-chain capabilities revolutionize this dynamic, introducing the concept of on-chain retargeting. This allows organizers to recognize and reward attendees based on their verified, blockchain-stored event histories. Such granularity in targeting and rewarding offers a new depth to the organizer-attendee relationship, enabling personalized and meaningful connections that extend far beyond the event itself.\n\n\n### Benefits for Metis Ecosystem\nThe Metis ecosystem benefits through a new composable building block that is now accessible to all users and builders. Users will now have a record on Metis of their event attendance. Each event is a deployed contract onto Metis. Each attendee is a new wallet and on chain transaction with a ticket either minted directly or airdropped into the user's wallet. This brings more volume and value directly to the Metis chain. It also offers an opportunity to price tickets in METIS or other ERC20 tokens on Metis, meaning users need to bridge more assets onto the chain. They also may lock more liquidity to make it convenient to access future events.\n\n### Summary\nOverall, it is inevitable that much of the web2 world moves onchain. We hope to lead the charge for bringing live entertainment onchain and onto Metis. The specific value Blocklive brings to Metis lies in its ability to transform event attendance into a verifiable, on-chain record. This integration enhances user engagement by making each event participation a part of the user's digital identity on the blockchain. By deploying events as smart contracts on Metis, we're not just increasing the blockchain's transaction volume; we're also diversifying its use cases and proving its capacity to support complex, real-world applications.\n\n\n### Official Links: Website, Docs, Audits, etc.\nBlocklive homepage: https://blocklive.io/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/blocklive_\nWarpcast: https://warpcast.com/blocklive\nBlog: https://mirror.xyz/0xc98f5Be61ef54d8551B59E8bC428C1AFAAd77653\nDocs: https://blocklive.gitbook.io/docs",

It uses the LayerZero v2 protocols native gas refuel function, allowing users to bridge native gas across the LayerZero network. Users can bridge to all 40+ supported LayerZero chains with a single inbound transaction. Each selected destination chain is its own unique LayerZero transaction.\n\n**Proposal:**\n\nWe've been in talks with the Metis team and we would like to kick off Spring with a joint AMA between our teams.\n\nWith that! Putting forward a proposal to gauge interest for an AMA as well as to explore some partnership ideas. We're excited to hear what the community thinks.\n\nJust a quick reminder about what we do: Gas.zip is the fastest one-stop gas refuel bridge for over 164+ chains and counting. You can instantly bridge to multiple destination blockchains with just a single inbound fueling transaction. Users can bridge to Metis from ~10 inbound chains making it really easy to onboard quickly and easily.\n\nSince January, we've seen a steady uptick in users using Gas.zip to bridge to Metis. We've noticed two types of users: new people who are more exploratory and regulars who need to top up their wallets. We believe these numbers will only continue to grow as both projects keep shipping. Excited to host an AMA to discuss the overlap in users and more. \n\nIn short, we're excited about this partnership and can't wait to do some co-marketing on Twitter/X to get more people using Metis and Gas.zip together.\n\nLet us know what you think.\n\nThanks!\nNic\n\nLinks:\nWebsite: https://www.gas.zip/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/gasdotzip\nDiscord: Gasdotzip\nDocs: https://dev.gas.zip/overview",

      "title": "Ecosystem Proposal: MONKEX | The Metis OG Community",
      "content": "[Website](https://monkex.net/). [Twitter](https://twitter.com/MonkexNFT)  [Docs](https://monkex.gitbook.io/docs)  [LinkTr](https://linktr.ee/monkex)  \n![c5e6501b29044c3016ad33878309b201324a9853.png](ipfs://bafkreicvzqyz4xmbq2vmvt74mjo5fuiq4gdvxlizecjxkxb2v624tywnrq)\n\n## Overview\nAllow us to introduce you to the Monkex Coffee Shop Club, a thriving community-driven project located on the Metis Andromeda network. Launched on July 1st, 2022, we arrived on Andromeda with a mission to shake things up.\n\nThe Monkex Coffee Shop Club is more than just a community, it's a place where individuals from all walks of life can come together to share their love for the digital world. Our goal is to bring people together and to build a supportive and inclusive environment where everyone can thrive. Monkex community not only serves as a gateway to the Metis Ecosystem but also provides invaluable guidance and support for newcomers, offering advice and assistance on how to seamlessly onboard into the dynamic and ever-changing Metis ecosystem.\n\nHere on the Andromeda network, we're building something truly unique and special. Our project is developed and powered by the Metis community, made up of seasoned OG's who have been with us through thick and thin. Many of these seasoned OG's have been in crypto long enough to develop some skills in programming, marketing, project management, social media management, and more. These skill sets have the potential to drive Monkex to many places now and in the future.\n\n## Monkex Utilities\n-  Community building is our primary goal and essence.\n- Digital identities with Monkex Coffee Shop Club NFTs.\n- Central Hub where OG's reside with incredible Metis knowledge and the ability to heavily assist with onboarding and mentoring new users to Metis -Andromeda, thus accelerating their understanding and adoption of the ecosystem.\n- Celebrating the essence of Metis through memes and gifs.\n-  DEFI farming with incentivized LP.\n-   Embracing a deflationary economy with the $MONKEX token.\n-Seeking to become a decentralized community project that integrates seamlessly with Metis and in the future - Metis common.\n- Opportunity to participate in Monkex Gaming Hub.\n\n## Value proposition\nThe value of Monkex lies in its community. Blockchain technology is rapidly gaining adoption, with retail users actively engaging on-chain. However, some projects, such as memecoins or NFTs, exploit less experienced users for quick financial gains. These temporary projects ultimately harm the entire network. We are here to change that narrative and have successfully done so for nearly 2 years.\n\nMany scam tokens have been identified and community members successfully warned and assisted to navigate their way through these sometimes uncertain times. This is just one value that Monkex provides to the Metis ecosystem.\n\nThe Monkex NFT collection is another area of value and has become seminal to the Metis Ecosystem. It is recognized widely as a Metis OG digital identity and brings a level of original Metis pride to its holders. These NFT's have also since been inscripted on the blockchain, making them one of very few in the entire crypto space to have done so.\n\nAnother area of value lies in the Monkex Gaming Hub which is located on our discord. This is a hub where crypto gaming alpha is dropped and crypto gaming access is shared for Monkex members to earn through gaming. There is now a treasury where a portion of the earnings are filtered to and this is will be used (in a dao format) to explore other gaming opportunities to bring more value to Monkex holders.\n\n## Roadmap \n![e701ff955d6e6967466d6b199016f7450aebce54 (1).png](ipfs://bafkreicvpu62cxhwbpobi5ogmgjtw6xmdtcxzdv26hiv47x24vfvgilxee)\n\nOur main goal and objective is to establish a Decentralized Autonomous Company powered by the Metis community. We are nearing the completion of this and have successfully settled on-chain. Our future relies on our community, and we incentivize individuals to join us in building together. Metis is in the hands of the Metis people.\n\n## Audit Information\nWe have utilized the standardized ERC20 2 and ERC721 contracts from OpenZeppelin, which have undergone thorough auditing and are ready for use. You can find audit information on sites like cookbook.dev.\n\n## Security\nToken liquidity pool burnt on sushi.com, ensuring maximum security for our community.\nOur code is hard-coded, and we abide by the principle that the code is law.\n\n## Token utility\nOur vision is to become the deflationary index token for the Metis ecosystem. We already have a number of pairs being arbitrated between exchanges, and more incentives are in the pipeline to add additional pairs with Metis ecosystem tokens, such as Hercules $Torch.\n\nMonkex token is available on HerculesDex Genesis pools providing some great utility for its holders as well as added volume for the Metis Andromeda blockchain. Here we have autonomous management, with autonomous incentives and real yield (DEFI). Farming with real APR and 2% tax distribution back to LP providers.\n\nWhat sets us apart is that we have taken a different approach. While most tokens are inflationary and decrease in value over time as they release more of their supply into circulation, our token is deflationary. We have already burnt 1/7 of the total supply through trading mechanisms, providing protection against downside risks. This makes our token a perfect fit to become the ecosystem's index token.\n\nMonkex tokens were airdropped to many Andromeda wallets (those that had participated in the NFT scene on Metis) to ensure widespread distribution and incentivize engagement among community members. Today there are over 2850 holders and this continues to grow.\n\nMonkex token's presence brings volume to the Metis Andromeda blockchain. Arbitrage bots actively maintaining price stability across multiple exchanges, fostering a healthy trading environment while increasing the overall transaction volume on the platform.\n\nIn addition, we are actively building a community treasury, which is secured by a 7-of-7 multi-signature mechanism. This ensures that trusted individuals are involved in the governance and management of the treasury.\n\n## Conclusion\nAfter actively building our community and contributing on Andromeda for two years now, we are now applying to become a CVP. We have already proven ourselves to the Metisians and are excited about the opportunities that lie ahead. It is important to note that Monkex has operated without raising any funds, and the project has been entirely driven by community members that believe in the Metis ethos.\n\nWe firmly believe in the power and potential of Metis. It is our home, and we are dedicated to contributing to its growth and success. Join us at Monkex Coffee Shop Club, where we are shaping the future of the digital world together.\n\nThank you for your consideration!\n![6b0a8f589c6897dc46d71f8c12f06f67f5513bf9.jpeg](ipfs://bafybeigsj2utq2nj7umqoaaftmlnwhsnfir3zcog2enjaufrs4456wmyae)",

      "title": "Ecosystem Proposal: Barsik – the mascot of Metis",
      "content": "**Introduction:**\n**Barsik; The Mascot of Metis Chain**\nThe internet has a soft spot for cats, and that love is translating into the world of cryptocurrency with Barsik. This purrfectly named memecoin isn't just another cat-themed token – it's named after Natalie's beloved pet cat .\n \nBarsik holds court on the Metis Network, a blockchain known for its speed and affordability. Barsik is not just a memecoin, it's a furry homage to the feline who stole Natalie's heart.\n \n**Value Proposition:**  \nWhile Barsik might not be the absolute first cat memecoin, it has the potential to carve its own unique path on the Metis Network as its the first ever cat memecoin. Barsik could become a major contender in the ever-growing world of memecoins. \n \n**Uniqueness Factor:** \nBarsik became the first memecoin on Metis to hit a $7 million all-time high (ATH), rocketing straight to the top. To cap that, Barsik also holds the title for the fastest growing memecoin ever, amassing a massive community of 2,000 holders within days of launch attracting interest from other chains. \n\n \n**Benefits for Metis Ecosystem:** \nBy offering a piece of the \"founders' cat\" trend, Barsik entices new holders to join the Metis ecosystem.  These new users bring fresh energy and potential to the Metis network, expanding its reach and community. \n \n**Media:**\n![image|690x229](upload://xs4WYrn2qUvMaSVyjMrYVDDxdR1.jpeg)\n\n \n**Roadmap: **\n**Phase 1:**  \n**Giveaways:** There will be giveaways and charity visits sponsored by the Barsik Team.  \n \n**Partnerships:** Barsik tends to partner with like minded projects who push for a change in meme culture on Metis chain and also with Defi protocols that incentivize Barsik holders.  \n \n**Token locker:** To champion safety on Metis, our dApp will enable projects to lock their liquidity on Metis chain. \n**Multisend app:** To enable projects on Metis airdrop in bulk to holders in one transaction to save cost.  \n \n\n**Phase 2** \nBarsik’s goal here is to build a permissionless launchpad that will serve as an incubation dApp for fundraising for developers who want to build on the Métis chain. \n \n**Official Links:** \nWebsite: https://barsikmetiscat.com/ \nTwitter: https://x.com/Barsik_MetisCat",

      "title": "Ecosystem Proposal: A51 Finance",
      "content": "A51 is building a remote control for liquidity position offering a superior interface to interact with Uniswap v3 and other concentrated DEXs. Allowing LPs to have more control over their liquidity position, and helping them earn higher yield and enhancing the user experience of liquidity provider.\n\nKEY FEATURES:\n1. Rebalancing Strategy: LPs can define how their liquidity responds by selecting mode (Bull, Bear, and Dynamic) to adjust liquidity based on macro market trends.\n2. Exit Preference: Enables automatic execution of liquidity exit strategies based on set parameters.\n3. Liquidity Distribution: LPs can determine how liquidity should be distributed with options such as exponential, flat, or single tick available out of the box.\n4. Hedging: Provides LPs with the option to hedge their positions through borrowing or options trading.\n\nPROPOSAL\nGiven the extensive research that has recently been done into liquidity provision, we’re committed to equipping LPs on Metis with tools to design advanced strategies during the lifecycle of a liquidity position. In that sense, an official support from the Metis Foundation will be crucial for protocol growth and awareness. Co-marketing and fostering partnerships within Metis’ ecosystem will be expected in order for us to fully deploy A51’s potential.\n\nVALUE PROPOSITION:\nA superior interface built on top of HerculesDEX and other concentrated DEXs on Metis for active LPs. Equipping LPs with advanced tools to build autonomous strategies and have better control over their liquidity.This integration will allow LPs, in addition to setting ranges, to be able to specify when a rebalancing occurs, how the liquidity should be distributed, and how to hedge against the risks. In doing so, DEXs will get:\n\nImprove PnL for their users by offering these automations.\nAttract a diverse user base, including more experienced and strategic LPs.\nBecome the first DEX to introduce advanced liquidity management for active LPs.\n\nABOUT $A51 TOKEN:\nA51 charges a fixed base fee from LPs to use its automation layer. 50% of that goes to A51 stakers, and the other 50% initially goes to buy-back the tokens, and later will go directly to fund protocol development.Additionally A51 token will be used for governance purposes and an additional discount to be given to LPs who are holding A51 on using the protocol.\n\nAIRDROP & MOONROCK HUNT:\nIn Q1 March 2024, we kicked off a rewards program called the Moon Rock Hunt. It’s a 3-month long program based on 3 phases.The purpose is for the A51 users to earn points by using the A51 protocol:\n\n- Depositing liquidity\n- Creating and managing strategies\n- Referring A51 to their friends\n\nAfter collecting moon rocks (aka points) for 3 months, the users will become eligible for the confirmed $A51 token drop which is scheduled in Q3 2024.\nThe points earned will be converted to $A51 tokens.\n\nUSEFUL LINKS:\nWebsite: https://a51.finance/ \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/A51_Fi \nTelegram: a51_fi \nGitbook: https://a51-finance.gitbook.io/a51-finance\nAudit:https://github.com/a51finance/concentrated-liquidity-tool/tree/main/audits/Hashlock",

      "content": "Introduction\n \n![140d3191962db16e6a8025996bfad42c8efa46ad_2_517x172.jpg](ipfs://bafybeietw35p7g7rajfpy247ruprgexr2ao4ujjvri43gbvloirkdbpsjm)\n    \nEris is a groundbreaking decentralized lending and borrowing protocol, dedicated to bringing a versatile and efficient liquidity infrastructure to Metis ecosystem.\n\nWe aims to become the premier (#1) Metis native lending and borrowing platform, envisioning a space where users can effortlessly deposit any major asset and access a diverse range of supported assets for borrowing. Our mission is to establish a robust financial ecosystem within the Metis network, providing users with unparalleled flexibility, efficient capital deployment, and innovative borrowing options.\n\nEris’ Feature Set and Utility:\nEris incorporated powerful features to deliver a comprehensive lending and borrowing experience :\n\nUniversal Asset Deposits:\nEris enables users to deposit a wide array of major assets within the Metis ecosystem.\n\nMulti-Asset Borrowing:\nUsers can access a variety of supported assets and the upcoming Metis LST tokens. This feature enhances the platform’s utility, providing borrowers with a comprehensive set of options, along with expanding to the LST token utility.\n\nLiquidity Mining:\nEris introduces liquidity mining, allowing users to earn additional rewards by using Eris protocol. Incentivizes users to contribute to the platform’s liquidity, enhancing overall market depth.\n\nRevenues Sharing:\nStaking is integrated into Eris, providing users with an additional opportunity to earn rewards. Users can stake or lock up $ERS tokens and participate in the platform’s success by earning a share of generated revenues.\n\nDecentralized Governance:\nEris places governance in the hands of its community, allowing users to actively participate in decision-making processes within the platform.\n\ncTokens:\nRepresenting users’ deposited assets, cTokens accrue interest in real-time, providing a dynamic and yield-generating element to users. Additionally, protocols within the Metis ecosystem can leverage cTokens for various purposes.\n\nFlash Loans:\nEmpowering users with instant, uncollateralized loans for efficient arbitrage, liquidation, and yield farming strategies.\n\nMetis Ecosystem Integration:\nEris is closely integrated with the Metis network, making the most of its efficiency and ability to scale.\nThe platform seamlessly connects with other Metis-based decentralized applications (dApps), such as the soon-to-be-launched HerculesDEX, to optimize synergistic opportunities.\n\nCollateral Optimization:\nA sophisticated collateral management system ensures users can optimize their asset portfolios for improved financial stability.\n\nEris’ Unique Value Proposition:\nEris prioritizes community engagement through decentralized governance, ensuring that the platform evolves in tandem with user needs. Lenders who provide liquidity to Eris are interacting and providing utility to the platform and Metis ecosystem. In addition, lenders can capture the added value from the communities’ engagement through the native token $ERS. Borrowers can withdraw against collateralized assets to obtain liquidity (working capital) without selling their assets.\n\nEris’ Roadmap:\nThe roadmap is designed to advance Eris into a leading decentralized lending and borrowing platform:\n\nStrategic Partnerships with Metis Projects: \nWe’ll be unveiling major collaboration announcements with both established and upcoming key projects within the Metis network.\n\nGrant and Fundraising: \nTo support project development (LPs, lending pools, development, treasury, etc.) and onboard key players, Eris will apply for the grant program (MetisEDF) and plan fundraising campaigns.\n\nPublic Launch:\nLaunch of Eris Protocol platform\nLiquidity Provisioning and Token Generation Event (TGE)\n$ERS Staking\n\nGovernance Implementation: \nActivation of decentralized governance mechanisms, giving users a voice in shaping Eris on Metis.\n\nEris Integration with Metis dApps: \nSeamless integration with other Metis-based decentralized applications, fostering a cohesive ecosystem.\n\nCommunity-Led Initiatives: \nLaunch of community-driven initiatives, and programs to encourage participation within the Metis-Eris community.\n\nSecurity Audits: \nRegular security audits and ongoing improvements to ensure the highest standards of security for users on the Metis network\n\nContinuous Improvements: \nContinual enhancements are underway to introduce new features such as Isolated Lending Pool and ensure the highest standards for our users (liquidity optimisation, staking system improvement and many more…).\n\nSecurity and Assurance:\nEris is built upon Radiant Capital’s V1, which was audited by PeckShield and Solidity Finance (audits reports are available under this link Audits - Radiant). This choice was influenced by its secure AAVE overlay and advanced token features, such as revenue sharing, governance, and a robust liquidity mining distribution scheme.\n\nEris places a high priority on the security of its platform. It’s important to note that we adapted the code to our platform without making changes to the codebase. Additionally, we undergo thorough security audits, implement robust smart contract practices, and maintain continuous monitoring. These steps are integral to our pledge to provide users with a secure environment.\n\nMultisignature Approach: \nAdopting a multisig (multi-signature) approach to enhance security, mitigating risks associated with centralized single-key wallets.\n\nToken Utility:\nEris operates on a single-token framework with a limited supply. $ERS serves as the native utility token, offering various benefits such as governance participation, revenues sharing.\n\nLenders and borrowers have the opportunity to earn and accumulate $ERS tokens based on their involvement and contributions to the platform (=liquidity mining).\n\nEris’ Team:\nWith over 5 years of experience in the crypto space, our core team comprises two full-stack developers, a project manager and DeFi strategist, a business developer, and a graphic designer overseeing UX/UI and assets. Furthermore, we’re supported by contributors who help us with various technical and marketing tasks.\n\nOperational methodology:\nJust a heads up on our development approach – we’ve adopted a V model. This involves diving deep into functional and non-functional requirements specific to the unique features of Metis’ blockchain. We kick off with a detailed analysis, progress to a high-level system design outlining how the protocol interacts with Metis.\n\nConclusion:\nIn summary, Eris is set to redefine decentralized lending and borrowing on Metis, offering a robust, customizable, and community-driven platform. We aim to provide advanced features, promoting financial inclusivity and user empowerment.\n\nThank you for considering Eris!\n\nOFFICIAL LINKS:\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/ErisFi_\nWebsite: https://eris-finance.com/ \nTelegram: Contact @eris_finance\nDeck: https://pitch.com/v/deck-eris-qiqz4f\nTokenomics: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rrPqI4yPAoriJpixn2ClOmPa94TB3TgZ/edit#gid=1247244902",

We offer significant advantages, including:\n\n→ Low interest rates on loans\n\n→ Low minimum collateral ratios starting at 125%\n\n→ Liquidity re-utilization across DeFi protocols on Metis\n\n→ STS stakers will earn 100% of protocol revenue\n\nThis enhances capital efficiency and also fosters a robust, secure borrowing environment.\n\n \n![2-stablish.jpeg](ipfs://bafybeieu4hgj2kwojvr5sllldorrafsyk2a4ol3yxnd4hqeo2fkiceuwli)\n    \n\n## **Innovation and Community Value**\n\nStablis extends the Liquity codebase to enable multiple collateral types and ensure a broad spectrum of Metis protocols can integrate seamlessly. Our dual-token system, featuring $USDs for stablecoin loans and $STS for protocol governance and revenue sharing, incentivizes both borrowers and stability providers. Our ecosystem fosters a participatory, secure environment for users, highlighted by our commitment to audits and non-custodial principles.\n\n## **Core Features**\n\n**Chests:** A Chest is where you initiate and manage your loan. Each Chest is associated with a Metis address, and each address can only have one Chest per collateral type. If you are familiar with Vaults or CDPs on other platforms, Chests share a similar conceptual framework.\n\nChests maintain two balances: one consists of assets serving as collateral, and the other represents a debt denominated in USDs. You can modify the amounts of each by adding collateral or repaying debt. As you make adjustments to these balances, the collateral ratio of your Chest changes accordingly. You have the flexibility to close your Chest at any time by fully repaying your debt.\n\n**Stability pool:** The Stability Pool acts as the primary safeguard in upholding system solvency. Its role is to act as the liquidity source for repaying debt from liquidated Chests, ensuring a consistent backing for the total USDs supply.\n\nWhen a Chest gets liquidated, an amount of USDs equivalent to the remaining debt is burned from the Stability Pool, settling the debt. In return, the entire collateral from the liquidated Chest is transferred to the Stability Pool.\n\nStability Providers, who contribute USDs to the pool, fund the Stability Pool. Over time, Stability Providers experience a pro-rata reduction in their USDs deposits but gain a pro-rata share of the liquidated collateral. Given that Chests are likely to be liquidated just below the minimum collateral ratio, it is anticipated that Stability Providers will receive a greater dollar-value of collateral relative to the debt they settle. Any collateral received by Stability Providers is free to be traded back to USDs or other assets.\n\n**Redemption mechanism:** We implement a redemption mechanism to support USDs’ $1 soft peg. As soon as USDs goes under peg, there is an incentive for arbitrage traders to buy USDs on the open market and redeem against collateral of the Chest(s) with the lowest collateral ratio. This arbitrage creates demand for USDs and brings it back to peg.\n\nIt’s the process of exchanging USDs for any collateral type asset at face value, where 1 USDs is always considered exactly worth $1. In this process, for x USDs, users receive x dollars worth of chest collateral in return. Users have the flexibility to redeem their USDs at any time without limitations.\n\n**STS Staking:** From the moment users stake their STS in the staking vault, they will start earning real yield from the borrowing and redemption fees corresponding to their share of the total staked STS tokens at the moment the fees are generated. Also 100% of the interest fees will go directly to the STS stakers. Stakers have the flexibility to withdraw their staked assets at any time as there isn't a lock-up period in place.\n\n**Governance:** STS token holders are empowered with the right to cast their votes on important Stablis governance proposals. The main focus of these proposals will be to fine-tune borrowing fees and interest rates, ensuring that Stablis remains aligned with the ever-evolving market standards and rates. This dynamic governance structure is designed to keep our protocol competitive and responsive to the needs of our community.\n\n## **What Stablis means for Metis**\n\nBy leveraging the Metis blockchain we introduce a groundbreaking approach to unlocking more capital. It enhances the Metis ecosystem by enabling interest-free loans against yield-generating assets, thus promoting capital efficiency and financial inclusivity while significantly expanding Metis’ total value locked (TVL). Stablis' integration into Metis not only diversifies the blockchain's DeFi offerings but also attracts a broader user base seeking innovative, low-risk borrowing solutions. This symbiotic relationship fosters growth and stability within the Metis ecosystem, contributing to its overall value proposition and appeal to both developers and users.\n\n## **$STS Tokenomics***\n\n**Max supply: 100M**\n- Community Incentives: 45.7M\n- Airdrop: 0.3M\n- Public Sale: 20M\n- Team: 16M\n- Advisors: 4M\n- Treasury: 10M\n- Initial liquidity: 4M (Locked)\n*subject to change\n\n## **Pre-Launch Roadmap**\n\n \n![3-stablish.jpeg](ipfs://bafybeih7zc3gybpa7iphnexjyjj34ly6o7reqbsepipnrsvkeidrc2zprq)\n    \n## **Request for CVP Status**\n\nGiven our innovative approach to DeFi on Metis, adherence to high security standards, and commitment to community engagement, we propose that Stablis be granted Community Verified Project status. This recognition will not only validate our efforts but also enhance our visibility and trust within the broader DeFi community.\n\nWe look forward to the feedback and are happy to provide any additional information required.\n\n \n![4-stablish.jpeg](ipfs://bafybeidvvlw35jskqaddcbzqbrdu6ydti562sdogqahcsbd6cckrpb6bci)\n    \n## **Conclusion**\n\nStablis represents the forefront of LSD based borrowing solutions on Metis, with a focus on security, efficiency, and community empowerment. As such, we believe Stablis is an exemplary candidate for CVP status, promising to contribute significantly to the ecosystem's growth and stability.\n\n## **More Information**\n\nWebsite: [![](upload://gJ41wZkmEQpnzhOicvkkBOgQNkO.png)Stablis](https://stablis.finance/)\n\nTwitter: [![](upload://piznTcXs6uGyhiBABqVvXwNfyAS.png)Stablis Protocol 🌿 (@StablisProtocol) on X](https://twitter.com/StablisProtocol)\n\nDocs: [![](upload://ful5oPQWDennjUbJAqE8iB8uvrd.png)General | Stablis docs](https://docs.stablis.finance/)\n\nEmail: contact@stablis.finance",

It aims to aggregate the most attractive yield opportunities across the network, enabling users to maximize returns through various optimized strategies. MetLab emphasizes sustainability, long-term user engagement, and supports a wide range of collaterals to enhance safety and risk management.\n\nAdvantages and Excellence of MetLab:\n\nInnovative Yield Optimization: Through the concept of “Infinite Money Loops,” MetLab allows for the amplification of initial capital by leveraging yield-bearing assets and reinvesting in yield-generating opportunities.\n\nDiverse Asset Support: Accepting a variety of yield-bearing assets, MetLab creates specialized markets that enhance liquidity and offer users diversified asset management options.\n\nStrategic Integration: MetLab integrates with LP markets, broadening the financial ecosystem and enabling users to use their LP tokens as collateral for further investments.\n\nEnhanced TVL: MetLab’s approach to collateral diversification and competitive yields aims to significantly increase the Total Value Locked (TVL) within the Metis ecosystem.\n\nMetLab role for the Metis Ecosystem:\n\nTVL Gathering:\nBy utilizing yield-bearing collaterals and offering incentives, MetLab is expected to attract significant TVL to the Metis ecosystem, enhancing the network’s value and appeal.\n\nCapital Utilization:\nUsers can leverage their yield-bearing collaterals for more efficient capital use, accessing stablecoin markets or engaging in strategic asset shorting.\n\nEcosystem Bootstrap:\nMetLab’s close alignment with Metis Network and its focus on yield-bearing tokens present new opportunities for other protocols within the ecosystem, fostering innovation and growth, including yield bearing collaterals from other protocols and ability to build strategies on top of MetLab markets.\n\nOn-Chain Liquidity:\nMetLab’s operational model will generate deeper on-chain liquidity for all utilized assets, including the MET token, by increasing trading volume through leverage and deleveraging activities, hence creating more incentive for liquidity providers.\n\nSticky Liquidity:\nThe token economics of MetLab incentivize long-term liquidity provision, likely resulting in more stable MET token liquidity and therefore long term yields for lending markets.\n\nExample of Metlab leverage utilization\n\nInitial Deposit: A user starts by depositing funds into the METIS-USDT pool on the any dex. This is a primary way to generate yield on the platform.\n\nLeveraging Through MetLab: Next, the user takes the LP tokens received from the dex and uses them as collateral on MetLab. By doing so, the user can borrow additional tokens against their LP.\n\nReinvestment for Enhanced Yield: The borrowed tokens can then be redeposited back into the LP, allowing the user to farm yields on a larger amount than the initial investment. This method amplifies the earning potential through compound farming.\n\nLet’s consider hypothetical APRs for a clearer understanding:\n\n• DEX LP APR: Assume an APR of 93% for providing liquidity in a METIS-USDT pool. \n \n![e621d434909fa15e7f1b651fe1549e49d3f21ee2.png](ipfs://bafkreigfoh2qaoyaunnkifh777albehyyyxnzyrvfaogiaa4qpa52wog3q)\n    \n• MetLab Deposit Incentives: Metlab offers additional incentives for deposits, the base rate of 10% and additional 10% of emission incentives in MET token. This means, users earn additional yield on top of their LP yield, making the yield 113% APR.\n\n• Borrow Interest for USDT: Borrowing USDT to leverage your investment might come with an interest rate of 15% per year.\n\n• Attractive Deposit Rates: The interest paid by borrowers (e.g., for leveraging positions) creates attractive APR for other users, fostering a healthy lending and borrowing ecosystem.\n\nAssuming the LP value of 100,000 USD, and LTV of 80% means that the user can leverage his position to 450,000 USD value.\n\nMaking it 450k deposit and 350k borrow.\n\nEarning 113% APR for 450K, which makes 508,5k revenue.\n\nWhile paying 15% for 350k borrow, which makes 52,5k.\n\nProfit for the user would be 456k per year. Hence, effective APR for initial deposit would be 456%.\nNumbers may differ and are subject to volatility, nevertheless, the market will self-balance as users will always monitor the yields.\n\nBenefits and Engagement\n\nUser Engagement: The mechanics of leveraging and yield farming on Metlab encourage users to actively monitor and manage their investments daily. This constant engagement fosters a deep connection with the ecosystem.\n\nBuilt for the Long-Term: Leveraged yield opportunities and the token economics of Metlab incentivize users to become long-term participants in the ecosystem, enhancing loyalty and sustained growth.\n\nEcosystem Growth: By facilitating such strategies, Metlab not only benefits individual users but also contributes to the growth and vibrancy of other protocols within the ecosystem, like Heremes, Netswap, Hercules, WAGMI, and others.\n\nPlatform preview:\n \n![28bb6caea79b8ba430023e4916027489d152e048_2_690x431.jpg](ipfs://bafybeifancxkamgqhu5mfwkhohhqlwik3jgnbmlkbgj24kzawnxe4gdjra)\n    \nTimeline:\n\nToken sale - within 3 weeks of proposal pass\n\nProtocol launch - within 3 weeks of proposal pass\n\nOur links:\n\nDapp: https://metlab.xyz/\nDocs: https://docs.metlab.xyz/\nDiscord: MetLab 2\nTelegram: metlabxyz\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/0xMetLab\n\nConclusion:\n\nThe proposed partnership and initial network contribution are pivotal for accelerating MetLab’s integration within the Metis ecosystem, amplifying its benefits across DeFi, and setting a precedent for innovative financial solutions. We invite Metis Network to consider this proposal and join us in shaping the future of decentralized finance.",

      "content": "We recently listed Envio as a supported real-time data indexing framework in the Metis Developer Documentation including a tutorial, which can be viewed here:\n\nhttps://docs.metis.io/dev/tools/indexers/envio\n\nWe also held a developer workshop and did some co-marketing with Metis: https://twitter.com/MetisL2/status/1757767251237699591 1\n\nAs an ecosystem partner, Envio is looking to be listed on the Metis Ecosystem Page on the Landing Site: Ecosystem – Metis-Smart L2\n\nDescription:\nEnvio is a modern, multi-chain EVM blockchain indexing framework speed-optimized for querying real-time and historical data.\n\nCategory:\nInfrastructure / Developer Tooling / Data Indexer\n\nTarget audience:\nMetis Developers and Data Analysts\n\nUse cases:\nDapps, Wallets, Explorers, Data Analytics, Machine Learning, Notifications\n\nAdditional Background Context:\nEnvio is a supported real-time data indexing framework on Metis, which includes hyper-performant data infrastructure that is capable of syncing Metis data 100x faster than standard RPC (RPC is optional). This greatly improves the developer experience on Metis, and significantly increases application performance for improved user experience.\n\nWhat is Envio?\nEnvio is a feature-rich indexing solution that provides application developers and data analysts with a seamless and efficient way to index and aggregate real-time or historical blockchain data. The indexed data is easily accessible through custom GraphQL queries, providing developers with the flexibility and power to retrieve specific information. Envio offers native support for Metis (mainnet and testnet) and has been designed to support high-throughput blockchain applications that rely on real-time data for their business requirements.\n\nEnvio has also onboarded its accelerated data query layer, Hypersync, onto Metis at no cost to the Metis foundation. HyperSync is a hyper-performant and resilient database, providing APIs that bypass JSON-RPC for 100x faster syncing of historical data. HyperSync by default powers the indexer, with the use of RPC being optional. Using HyperSync, application developers do not need to worry about RPC URLs, rate-limiting, or managing infrastructure and can easily sync large datasets in a few minutes, something that would usually take hours or days via RPC. HyperSync is also available as a standalone API for data analytic use cases. Data analysts can interact with the HyperSync API using JavaScript, Python, or Rust clients and extract data in JSON, Arrow, or Parquet formats.\n\nWhat problem does Envio solve and what is Envio’s value proposition for Metis ecosystem?\nAt Envio, our mission is to solve the data query problem, empowering developers and data analysts on Metis with significantly faster, cheaper, and more flexible access to Metis data, and thereby reducing costs in terms of development time and increasing the responsiveness of Metis applications for improved user experience. Improved user experience = increased adoption.\n\nWe have onboarded our accelerated data query layer, HyperSync, empowering Metis developers with 100x faster sync speeds than standard RPC methods: HyperSync | Envio\n\nWe conducted a performance benchmarking exercise comparing common indexing frameworks, where we accomplished indexing 5 million Uniswap events in under 10 minutes. In contrast, it takes traditional indexers 16 hrs & 40 min to index the same events.\n\nPlease see here for reference: Race to the Blocks: Benchmarking Blockchain Indexer Sync Speeds | Envio\n\nEnvio has also included a tutorial on our no-code contract import feature, allowing Metis developers to create an Indexer and queryable API for single or multiple smart contracts in less than 5 minutes, emphasizing our priority on developer experience.",

      "title": "Ecosystem Proposal: Pumpkin - single-sided liquidity on Metis (Artichoke Fork)",
      "content": " \n![image](ipfs://bafkreigyenefxuwdveb3t4fhyhjq5t7neoaxumn2hp7bgekbcprsygc7la)\n    \n\nPumpkin is a native-based liquidity provision and liquid re-staking protocol built on the Metis Ecosystem. Within it’s core, Pumpkin is essentially a native fork of Artichoke, a protocol that has already demonstrated traction and track record on the Arbitrum Blockchain.\n\nUnlike many other protocols, Pumpkin provides a one-sided liquidity layer to any ERC-20 on top of any well-known decentralized exchange, by using a collateralized debt position in conjunction with an omnipool.\n\nAMMs, LPs and staking protocols have been widely used throughout the crypto ecosystem since inception. This is due to its simplicity and straight-forward, permissionless liquidity provision for new assets created on-chain. Regardless its widespread adoption, interacting with LPs, and staking itself, are not financially efficient and far from a flawless experience.​\n\nSeveral protocols such as Uniswap have improved LPs from V2 to V3 introducing range orders and one-sided liquidity provision. However, improvements are still not as efficient as we expected. Newer projects find really hard to build new and strong liquidity pools without giving up initial incentives.​\n\nPumpkin attempts to solve this issue by building a single-sided LP protocol (SSLP) for staking assets, without the need to provide an stable USD-pegged liquidity on the first stage of the protocol cycle.​​\n\nUSEFUL LINKS\n\nWebsite: https://pumpkinfinance.xyz 5\nDocumentation: Abstract | Abstract | Welcome to Pumpkin 4\nTwitter/X: https://twitter.com/pumpkin_fi 1\nTelegram: Telegram: Contact @pumpkin_fi 1\nAudit: publications/audit_reports/PeckShield-Audit-Report-TChoke-v1.0.pdf at master · peckshield/publications · GitHub 1\nPROPOSAL\n\nAs new and innovative liquidity protocol, Pumpkin aims to replicate what Artichoke did on the Arbitrum Blockchain. In that sense, an official support from the Metis Foundation will be crucial for protocol growth and awareness. Co-marketing will be expected from Metis in order for us to fully deploy Pumpkins’ potential.\n\nVALUE PROPOSITION\n\nSingle–sided liquidity provision built on top of HerculesDEX, using an omnipool approach with collateralized-debt positions on spNFTs (LP positions on Hercules V2 and V3), brinding deeper liquidity and more capital efficiency to the Metis Ecosystem.\n\nPumpkin is currently going through a public-sale using Hercules launchpad infrastructure: Hercules DEX | The Latest in DEX Technology. Upon completing our public sale, a PUMP/METIS LP will be deployed on top of Hercules and several Tails (omnipools’ Vaults) are going to be incentivized with the funds raised.\n\nSHORT-TERM ROADMAP\n\nMarch 30: Public IDO ends on HerculesDEX\n\nMarch 31/April 1: PUMP/METIS LP Goes Live\n\nApril 15: Pumpkin Protocol goes live with Staking\n\nApril 20: wMETIS/m.USDC Tail goes live with incentives\n\nMay: Announcing new partner Tails and deploys over Hercules\n\nMay: Peckshield Second Audit\n\nCONTACT\n\nTelegram Handle: @CXXVIII128",

      "title": "Ecosystem Proposal: Shoebill Finance - A LST Collateralizable Leverage Lending Platform on Metis",
      "content": "Introduction\n\nLiquid Staking is one of the best ways to hold a token with yield. Users can earn yields while the protocol/foundation of the original token can provide users an incentive to hold on to the token for a while longer, giving it momentum to increase in value with less selling pressure.\n\nHowever, the premise of this is that the liquid staking token should have a range of utility and value.\nShoebill Finance is the best fit to give additional utilities for the LSTs in Metis ecosystem, such as eMetis of ENKI.\n\nShoebill Finance is an LST Collateralizable Leverage Lending platform where users can maximize their yield on their LST or utilize it for other opportunities in the network ecosystem using borrowed assets via LST collateral with minimized risk of liquidation.\n\nWebsite: https://shoebill.finance 7\nNetworks: WEMIX, Manta, Klaytn\nSocial Media\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/ShoebillFinance 5\nTelegram: Telegram: Contact @ShoebillChat_ENG\nMedium: Shoebill Finance – Medium 2\nKey Features\n\nLST collateral: On Shoebill Finance, only LST tokens can be a collateral except a exceptional case, and those collateral won’t be lent to the users to get rid of a risk of bad debt.\nBorrowable original asset: After supplying LST, users can only borrow the original token which the LST is pegged to. Shoebill separated each markets to be paired only with LSTs and its pegged original token to minimize the risk of liquidation by market volatility.\nPrice oracle & Liquidation: Shoebill finance gets the price feed of the original tokens from verified oracles such as Pyth network, then calculates the price of LST from the exchange rate of the LST contract. Shoebill is tracking the price of LPs on DEXes just for reference, so the fluctuation of token price won’t induce liquidation to the users; only the accrueing borrow yield will.\nShoebill Token (SBL) Utility and Vesting Mechanism: Shoebill token will have various utilities and play a critical rol in our platform. Token holders can share platform profit as well as additional reward given as extra tokens. By just holding enough quantity of SBL, users can boost the token reward yield by supplying and borrowing LSTs and its original tokens on Shoebill. SBL holder will also receive reward share from the users who proceed ‘early-exit’ with penalty, while the half of the penalty is listed on auction to be sold with discounted SBL quantity. For the utilities, holders should stake their SBL through vesting, and the vesting mechanism will be aligned with long-term user engagement and ecosystem growth.\nValue Proposition\n\nShoebill Finance will enlarge the utility of LSTs in Metis and give the holders various options to grasp expected opportunities on expanding Metis ecosystem, and all with minimized worries of liquidation.\n\nRoadmap\n\n- Q1 2023: Launch of V1 (Done) - Shoebill Finance V1 launched on Klaytn network\n- Q3 2023: Upgrade to V2 and 1st Expansion (Done) - Shoebill Finance has been upgraded to V2, LST Collateralizable Leverage Lending Platform and expanded to WEMIX network\n- Q4 2023: 2nd Expansion and Surge (Done) - Shoebill Finance has expanded to Manta Pacific network and surged to $70M TVL by participating New Paradigm campaign which is focused on utilizing LSTs, STONE and wUSDM\n- Q1 2024: 3rd Expansion and Token Economy/Utility Launch - Shoebill Finance is working on its token economy with various utilities, and expecting expansion to Metis network as its 3rd expansion\n\nConclusion\n\nShoebill Finance is hoping to be a stepping-stone in the Metis ecosystem enhanced by Metis LST, as a DeFi maximize users’ capital efficiency.\n\nWhitepaper and Audit\n\nWhitepaper: https://docs.shoebill.finance\nAudit: Shoebill Finance - CertiK Skynet Project Insight",

      "title": "Ecosystem Proposal: Fyde - Treasury Protocol",
      "content": "### Introduction\n\nFyde pioneers a secure, non-custodial 'liquid vault' representing the cutting edge of DeFi asset management and is looking to establish a $100k pilot program with Metis.\n\nUsers deposit a variety of tokens into the vault, receiving instant diversification and gaining enhanced performance, liquidity and yield via the TRSY token (the vault wrapper token). Additionally, users are incentivised to trade TRSY, offering a reliable and efficient payment avenue. The governance token FYDE enables a series of incentives to facilitate deep and efficient on-chain liquidity for TRSY. This enables users to get both diversification and boosted on-chain liquidity in a single solution.\n\nThe protocol is stress tested and optimized by the Fyde Simulation Engine which stress tests on-chain protocols across black swan events.\n\nOur team is comprised of PhDs from Cambridge, Stanford, UCLA, portfolio managers from JPM and other bulge brackets, and builders from Synthetix, Ocean Protocol, Wintermute, and Bloomberg.\n\n### Value Proposition\n\nFyde Treasury Protocol provides a route for METIS holders to instantly diversify their holdings without having to market sell their METIS tokens.\n\nMETIS has been whitelisted by Fyde Treasury Protocol. After depositing METIS into Fyde’s liquid vault, the depositor receives TRSY which is backed by all assets in the vault. Currently if a METIS holder would like to diversify a part of their position they would have to sell METIS in the process.\n\nThe value proposition is structured largely to serve DAO treasuries / foundations / founders. Early community members, investors and core contributors can often have similar needs in terms of risk management.\n\nWe look forward to serving the METIS community and exploring how our solution complements the METIS ecosystem.\n\n### Uniqueness Factor\n\nFyde Treasury Protocol is a novel concept in DeFi. Currently, we are one of the leading solutions focused on providing a route for the diversification of native tokens (eg. METIS).\n\nWhile there are a number of protocols offering Treasury Management type solutions, they often create a mismatch where the treasury needs to sell native tokens into stables or ETH/WBTC first. This is often done at the detriment to token price and can open a protocol up to governance attacks.\n\nFyde circumvents this process by allowing protocols and teams to access treasury management solutions using their native tokens whilst being able to keep the governance rights of those tokens.\n\n### Benefits for Users\n\n* New trading Pairs:\n\nMETIS benefits from 35+ new direct trading pairs as tokens can be swapped without routing through WETH / USDT - our vault becomes the cheapest place to execute swaps at scale\n\n* No Lock-ups:\n\nDeposits are non-custodial and can be withdrawn instantly, providing flexibility to depositors\n\n* FYDE Points:\n\nMETIS is currently underweight in the liquid vault. All depositors of METIS while the token is underweight will receive 2x boosted FYDE points leading up to our TGE in Q2.\n\nSee the [Fyde app](https://app.fyde.fi/invest?assetAddress=0x9E32b13ce7f2E80A01932B42553652E053D6ed8e&panel=deposit) to deposit.\n\n### Benefits for Metis Ecosystem\n\n* Diversification:\n\nFyde enables the METIS ecosystem to diversify any concentrated METIS positions, enhancing overall resilience and allowing the ecosystem to better grow across market cycles.\n\n* Liquidity:\n\nDepositing METIS into Fyde's Liquid Vault increases liquidity and trading volume across DEXs / CEXs through new pairs.\n\n* Institutional Support:\n\nFyde is currently working on the distribution of TRSY to a number of institutional partners. These inflows will provide additional liquidity support for METIS.\n\n### Media\n\nYahoo Finance: [Fyde Treasury Secures $3.2 Million in Seed Funding Round for Crypto Treasury Management Solution](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/fyde-treasury-secures-3-2-095200966.html)\n\n[Fyde Blog Posts](https://www.fyde.fi/blog/)\n\n[Fyde Medium](https://medium.com/@fydetreasury)\n\n### Roadmap\n\nCurrent: Liquid Vault Launch\n\nLaunched V1 of the Fyde Liquid Vault, enabling deposits of native governance tokens into a diversified vault to receive $TRSY (Treasury Token).\n\nH1 2024: Swaps, TGE, POL\n\nSwaps will be enabled on the Liquid Vault. TGE of $FYDE (native gov. token) is expected to occur, enabling POL. Bonding curves to increase liquidity of $TRSY.\n\nH2 2024: MEV, LSTs/Restaking, Simulations\n\nMEV arbitrage will boost yield for Liquid Vault. Specific vaults for LSTs & Restaking will be focal point. Fyde simulation engine unveiled.\n\nH1 2025: Modular Vaults, Sim. Integration\n\nVaults will be modularized for customization and flexibility. Simulation engine vertically integrated and will play a larger role in Fyde.\n\nBeyond+: Continued Expansion\n\nContinued development of simulation engine and Fyde vaults product suit.\n\n### Summary\n\nFyde Treasury Protocol has whitelisted METIS as a core asset within the liquid vault. Fyde aims to support Metis users and the wider ecosystem to increase liquidity and stability for METIS.\n\n### Official Links\n\ndApp:[ https://app.fyde.fi/](https://app.fyde.fi/)\n\nOne Pager:[ https://docsend.com/view/sb69swsm9y6kbpgx](https://docsend.com/view/sb69swsm9y6kbpgx)\n\nDeck:[ https://docsend.com/view/uj2thhe8qpuqb6vd](https://docsend.com/view/uj2thhe8qpuqb6vd)\n\nGitbook:[ https://fydetreasury.github.io/fyde-docs/](https://fydetreasury.github.io/fyde-docs/)",

      "title": "Ecosystem Proposal: imToken Wallet",
      "content": "Jia Yung from imToken Wallet here, I do partnerships.\n\n**What is imToken** \nimToken is a non-custodial wallet that has been around since 2016. We have 15 million users and ~280k WAU that are mostly based in Asia.\n\n**Proposed collaboration**\n* imToken to support Metis on the wallet, promote MetisDAO to our users\n* In exchange, we run incentive campaigns with MetisDAO (similar to your campaign with AAVE) Would also appreciate if MetisDAO adds imToken Wallet in your ecosystem page\n\n**What's in it for MetisDAO**\n* imToken promotes Metis Journey to our users. This extends to MetisDAO projects as well, as we can promote them on our DApp browser.\n* Build your user base in Asia - Tap into our pool of users in this region\n* Long-term partnership - we see this collaboration as more than a one-time thing and would love to work in the long-term with Metis.\n\nAdding more information to the proposal \n\n**Uniqueness Factor**\n\n1. Non-custodial mobile wallet that supports custody of tokens across Ethereum mainnet, all major L2s, Bitcoin, TRON and Cosmos chain to name a few\n\n2. Native DEX (Tokenlon) in the wallet that allows users to swap tokens seamlessly or place limit orders. Currently support swaps across Ethereum, Polygon, Arbitrum and Optimism\n\n3. Users can stake their tokens easily on imToken wallet\n\n4. LON, native token of Tokenlon DEX can be staked to earn rewards, get discounts on trade fees and vote on Tokenlon Improvement Proposals\n\n**Value Proposition**\n \n![1imwallet.jpeg](ipfs://bafybeig6utzynibthfxlhonmd46zy6jktlrkau2rmcf6qjyz6bp42fovmu)\n    \n\nimToken has already supported Metis Andromeda. Users can transfer and receive their METIS tokens using imToken wallet. The bridge is supported using cBridge. If we run a Metis incentive campaign on imToken, the experience should be quite straightforward.\n\nWe want to make the experience more seamless for Metis users by doing the following\n\n* Bringing out Metis DApps (they are currently quite hidden)\n* Push notification and banner placed to promote Metis to our users\n\n**Roadmap**\nAs mentioned, Metis is now natively supported in the imToken wallet. We are happy to explore other additions if the proposal is approved\n\nWebsite: https://token.im/\nSocial media: https://twitter.com/imTokenOfficial",

      "title": "Ecosystem Proposal: Althea Finance - Unlocking LST Liquidity and Yield on Metis",
      "content": "![alt1.jpeg](ipfs://bafkreiaocz6xoakcpfdepgsfqs7z2hgj2d7r5ssamubwmeisslacpq7hdy)\n\n**INTRODUCTION:**\n\nThe much anticipated deployment of the Metis sequencer technology is set to catalyze substantial METIS token locking, spurring demand for METIS LSTs. Althea Finance harnesses the untapped potential of LSTfi yield on Metis, via a hybrid CDP Stablecoin and Yield Market platform. Enabling collateralization of yield bearing assets on Metis to mint aUSD, the Metis native stable unit of account, coupled with a yield market for speculation on yield bearing assets. This will enable optimized LST liquidity and yield on Metis. Introductory article [here](https://medium.com/@altheaprotocol/introducing-althea-finance-the-first-all-in-one-lstfi-solution-for-the-metis-ecosystem-unlocking-b81bfda14cd6).\n\n**VALUE PROPOSITION:**\n\n* With the introduction of their decentralized sequencer and $100m+ of grants, liquid staking is set to explode on Metis, with the launch of multiple METIS LSTs/LRTs.\n* This creates an urgent need for LSTfi/LRTfi solutions where holders of new METIS LSTs/LRTs can deploy their holdings to access liquidity & amplify yields\n* Althea Finance is meeting this need with the first all-in-one LSTfi/LRTfi solution for the Metis ecosystem\n* This will combine a Prisma-style LST-backed CDP stablecoin and a Pendle-style yield market in one product to unlock liquid staking yield and liquidity on Metis.\n* Finally, the THEA token at the heart of the Althea Finance ecosystem allows holders to earn revenue share, amplify rewards and participate in governance decisions.\n\n**UNIQUE FEATURES:**\n\nBringing both a stablecoin and yield market solution together under one roof will also unlock a range of exciting synergies and innovations that have not been achieved by prior standalone products on the mainnet. For example, users will be able to deploy assets from our yield-market as collateral for minting aUSD to boost yields by leveraging Althea’s proprietary interest rates market. The unique structure of Althea Finance will allow it to emerge as the central hub of the entire Metis ecosystem, by offering:\n\n* **A Stable Unit Of Account:** As a non-rebasing stablecoin with yield accrual upon redemption, aUSD can become the stable unit of account for the entire Metis ecosystem.\n* **A Foundation For Lending, Borrowing and Leverage:** As the central stablecoin for Metis, aUSD will also unlock the potential for a variety of lending, borrowing and leverage options across the chain.\n* **Secondary Debt Market:** Althea Finance will also have its own in-house secondary debt market, creating new arbitrage opportunities for users.\n* **LST Yield Aggregator:** By accepting all yield-bearing assets as collateral, aUSD will become a de facto yield aggregator for the Metis liquid staking sector.\n* **Sustainable Revenues:** Althea will have multiple revenue streams from minting fees, redemption fees and borrowing interest fees. This means it can provide a sustainable income for governance token holders and voting incentives for liquidity that don’t rely solely on the native token.\n\n \n![alt2.jpeg](ipfs://bafybeiejedv5b57eclbe25txydcilrzxdeumudhmmvoae734qmw25pp7xy)\n    \n\n**BENEFITS FOR USERS:**\n\nMetis recently made history by [introducing the first ever decentralized sequencer on an Ethereum Layer 2](https://twitter.com/MetisL2/status/1768313648982753629). This paves the way for users to start staking their METIS tokens, stimulating demand for METIS LSTs, which will be supported by [$100m of grants form the MetisDAO Foundation](https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2023/12/18/metis-ethereum-layer-2-network-creates-110m-fund-as-decentralized-sequencer-launch-nears/). In turn, the rise of METIS LSTs/LRTs will lead to a need for LSTfi solutions where METIS LST/LRT holders can access liquidity and amplify their yields.\n\nAlthea Finance will be the first all-in-one LSTfi solution for the Metis ecosystem, combining an LST-backed stablecoin with a native yield market to deliver everything Metis LST holders will need to maximize their yields and unlock liquidity. In addition the THEA token sits at the heart of the ecosystem offering rewards boosts, revenue share and governance rights.\n\nSome of the key functionality that Althea Finance will offer to Metis users is:\n\n* **A Multi-Asset CDP Stablecoin:** Holders of both METIS and METIS LSTs/LRTs will be able to mint aUSD.\n* **A Native Yield Market:** A Metis native Pendle-style yield market allows users to speculate on the future yields of LSTs and other yield-bearing assets.\n* **Revenue Share:** THEA holders who stake their tokens will receive 50% of protocol revenues from minting fees, borrowing fees, trading fees, redemption fees and more.\n* **Governance Rights:** THEA stakers will also be able to vote on key aspects of the protocols functioning, including how rewards are allocated to protocol users.\n* **Rewards Boosts:** Locking THEA tokens will also entitle holders to a multiple on any yields generated on the Althea protocol, plus revenue share and governance.\n\n**BENEFITS FOR METIS ECOSYSTEM:**\n\nTo estimate the size of the potential market for LSTfi solutions on Metis, one need only look at how the LSTfi sector has flourished on the Ethereum mainnet. [4 of the top 10 projects by TVL on the Ethereum mainnet](https://defillama.com/chain/Ethereum) are LSTfi/LRTfi projects, with a combined TVL of [$50bn+ across all LSTfi protocols](https://defillama.com/protocols/Liquid%20Staking).\n\nWith the MetisDAO Foundation [allocating $100m in grants](https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2023/12/18/metis-ethereum-layer-2-network-creates-110m-fund-as-decentralized-sequencer-launch-nears/) to fund its expansion, and LSTfi being the main focus, there is an unprecedented opportunity for first-movers to grab a similar market share. The entire value of LSTs lies in the fact that they make staked tokens and rewards liquid so that they can be used on further yield-bearing activities. Therefore as METIS LST offerings begin to go live on Metis, there will be an instant demand to put them to use.\n\nAlthea not only meets that need, but does so in a manner that will generate substantial and sticky TVL, liquidity, volume and yield, engaging DeFi users and keeping TVL on Metis. Furthermore Althea is built on tried and tested secure sustainable, and highly profitable architecture and business/revenue models from Ethereum mainnet (with our own innovative twists).\n\n**ROADMAP:**\n\nCVP and Metis grant submission, early supporters raise and IDO on Hercules DEX by end of March/early April. TGE, CDP testnet, initial audits, and mainnet launch BD and marketing kick off in April. Mainnet launch and ongoing DeFi integrations from May onwards.\n\n![alt3.jpeg](ipfs://bafybeide5q77zt2eiitfmrtxvjtdn4xwqrfadaedmodg7qat734znpi2fe)\n    \n\n**SUMMARY:**\n\nMETIS LSTs are coming to Metis! Ethereum has provided a blueprint for the potential. Users want liquidity, utility and optimized yield for their LSTs. Althea Finance brings two of the premier and proven models with an integrated Metis native CDP stablecoin and yield market. Based on proven revenue generating models, paired together to foster further unique innovation exclusive to Metis, and delivered by an experienced team. We'd love to connect with any fellow builders and active Metis ecosystem participants, so feel free to reach out on Twitter.

      "title": "Ecosystem Proposal: Halliday - Bringing Account Abstraction to Metis with the Halliday Appchain Wallet",
      "content": "Introduction:\n\nHalliday will connect Metis to commerce. We’ll solve the problem of the first dollar spent on the Metis chain by offering users a seamless onboarding experience and a one-click acquisition and management of any asset through our proprietary Orchestration Layer.\n\nAs the first Account Abstraction and native Onramp solution on Metis, we’ll make it easier than ever for new users to engage with this exciting ecosystem, regardless of their prior experience in Web3.\n\nBacked by a16z and #Hashed, we have partnered with prominent developers such as DeFi Kingdoms, Caldera, AltLayer, and Conduit. Our team comes from Stanford, Harvard, and Carnegie Mellon and has years of experience with the most recognized technology brands in the world, including Meta, Netflix, Samsung, and more.\n\nProposal for Metis:\n\nThrough its partnership with DeFi Kingdoms, Halliday plans to launch new and existing functionalities on Metis in conjunction with the game’s highly anticipated launch on the chain. In addition to our planned support of DeFi Kingdoms, Halliday would also like to extend its support to other applications building on this chain so that other developers may easily leverage the many benefits of Halliday’s product suite.\n\nAccount Abstraction\n\nAs the first “Web2 account” solution for DeFi Kingdoms across both of its existing realms (Crystalvale on DFK Chain in Avalanche and Serendale on Klaytn chain), Halliday represents the most streamlined way to play one of the world’s oldest and most successful Web3 games, unlocking a myriad of benefits for its players.\n\nApplications choosing to leverage Halliday’s Smart Account functionality will be able to access the following killer features:\n\n* Social Login: Via Halliday, users can create a “DFK Smart Account” with a single click by connecting their Google, Twitter, or email accounts and using that as a passwordless login solution to DFK. Before our integration, users could not access gameplay without already owning a Web3 wallet; now, users just need an email address to get started!\n\nHalliday works with developers to align on which of many various login solutions are activated for each application.\n\n* Passkeys / Biometric Authentication: Besides enabling Social login, Halliday allows users to create and access their wallets through a device-specific authentication (e.g., via Face or Touch ID). Halliday pioneered the space, representing one of the first wallets to enable this more secure, user-friendly alternative to passwords and EOAs. Developers working with Halliday can activate this functionality for unlimited users at no additional cost.\n* Session Keys: This is the killer feature of the DFK Smart Account – with Halliday, users can streamline how they transact on-chain by automatically signing certain types of transactions.\n\nIn DeFi Kingdoms, this vastly improves day-to-day gameplay, allowing users to instantly quest their heroes and make purchases, allowing them to focus on gameplay! There are no more annoying Metamask popups, and transferring across chains as you go to another realm becomes completely abstracted.\n\n* Gas Sponsorship: This feature allows developers to subsidize (or entirely pay for) gas fees on their platform and pay for them with any ERC-20 token. Combined with Social Login and Session Keys, the blockchain is nearly invisible to the end user, allowing them to engage with an on-chain application without any knowledge of Web3.\n\nOne-Click Onramp\n\nOnce a user creates an account and starts transacting via Session Keys and Gas Sponsorship, Halliday helps with the next step of blockchain abstraction: how to acquire native tokens. Unfortunately, the vast majority of tokens do not have a native onramp: users must first onramp to a token like ETH or USDC, and then navigate a complex sea of bridges and swaps – each requiring a unique gas payment and signature – before arriving at the intended end token.\n\nWith our first-of-its-kind one-click Onramp, Halliday simplifies the entire process. With our one-click Onramp, Halliday will permit users to onramp to any token on Metis with a single click.\n\nThis isn’t a pie-in-the-sky idea: we’re already live with DFK on both of their realms. [You can see how we enabled a one-click onramp to JEWEL on DFKChain here!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1EweA7SUoWM&feature=youtu.be)\n\nWith this functionality, we could, for example, enable DEXs on Metis to offer one-click onramps to any token they list. That would make any gas token, application-specific ERC-20, or memecoin easier to acquire than ever before.\n\nVia our existing partnership with MoonPay, we can offer this functionality to users in over 150 different countries and territories on Day One of our launch on Metis.\n\nNFT Checkout\n\nFinally, in addition to our one-click onramp, we also offer users the ability to purchase NFTs with a credit card. For projects that don’t need as many ERC-20 tokens, this feature, when coupled with Gas Sponsorship, allows users to do everything from signing up to purchasing assets to using those assets without ever having to onramp any funds, understand what tokens even mean, or even necessarily know they have a blockchain wallet!\n\nBenefits for Metis Ecosystem:\n\nHalliday’s proposed collaboration with Metis will bring the following benefits to its ecosystem:\n\n* User engagement and acquisition: As described above, Halliday’s product suite is intended to make it easier than ever for users to sign up for a blockchain application and start transacting and monetizing immediately.\n\nWe’ve already seen how our solution has attracted new users to DeFi Kingdoms, not only as players but as valuable members of the community and contributors to the economic prosperity of the entire ecosystem. We are excited to bring these same benefits to other developers building on Metis.\n\n* Attracting additional developers to the Metis ecosystem: At Halliday, we believe that removing barriers to entry to Web3 helps not just the end user but also the developer.

For a more comprehensive understanding, [please refer to the full version by clicking here](https://ceg.vote/t/governance-proposal-decentralized-sequencer-governance/1922)\n\n# Abstract\n\nAfter successful completion of the Community Testing on the testnet ([MIP-4 Proposal: Decentralize Testnet Sequencer and Activate Community Testing - Approved - CEG - Metis.io (ceg.vote)](https://ceg.vote/t/mip-4-proposal-decentralize-testnet-sequencer-and-activate-community-testing/1032/6)) we are ready to move to the next step and enable Decentralized Sequencers on the mainnet.\n\nThe purpose of this proposal is to establish and communicate governance procedures related to the Decentralized Sequencers.\n\n## Decentralized Sequencers\n\nMetis is reducing centralized risks in Layer 2 networks by launching a Decentralized Sequencer Pool for greater network decentralization and stability. Applicants aiming to be Sequencers need to support the Metis ecosystem through relevant requirements:\n\n-   Having experience in operating blockchain nodes.\n-   Possessing servers and network environments that meet the requirements (see  [Metis Developer Documentation](https://docs.metis.io/dev/decentralized-sequencer/overview)).\n-   Holding and locking a certain amount of METIS. The current lock-up threshold is 20,000 METIS, with a maximum of 100,000 METIS allowed for lock-up.\n\nThreshold and cap adjustments will be governed according to pool performance. METIS can be obtained either from the open market or through mining in the Sequencer pool by locking METIS.\n\n# Governance Procedures\n\nThe following list of governance procedures covers a lifetime of the Sequencer - starting from proposing a Sequencer, covering onboarding, offboarding and situations leading to that, slashing cases and rewards.\n\n## Proposing a Sequencer\n\nThe Sequencer will be proposed using the  _Metis Governance forum_  located at  [https://ceg.vote](https://ceg.vote/). The proposal should be submitted using the  [**Infrastructure**  proposal - Sequencer](https://ceg.vote/c/infrastructure-sequencer)  type. It will follow the process related to that type of proposal presented in the  _Governance Bluepaper - Roadmap_  ([Governance (Proposal Types)](https://metis-foundation.webflow.io/governance#Proposal)). The proposal will be tagged as a “`sequencer`” proposal.\n\n## Voting procedures\n\nVoting will happen on a  [Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/metislayer2.eth)  using the  **Infrastructure**  proposal type in the subject of the proposal.\n\n### Voting criteria\n\n-   A quorum requirement of\n    -   50k METIS tokens\n    -   500 or more wallet addresses participation\n-   80% or more approval vote to pass\n\n## Onboarding/Offboarding\n\nOnboarding and offboarding requests will be made by the members of the community using the  _Metis Governance forum_. Accepted proposals will be voted upon using the  [Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/metislayer2.eth)  voting platform. As described in the  [Community Proposal Voting Process Flow (metis.foundation)](https://www.metis.foundation/governance#Community)  the Governance Working Group will oversee  **Infrastructure**  proposals and reserve the right for the veto right on any  **Infrastructure**  proposals.\n\n### Onboarding\n\nWhile reviewing the onboarding proposal the main criteria for evaluation of the Sequencer candidate are node operating experience and proven  [SLAs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service-level_agreement).\n\nOnboarding of the Sequencer includes the following steps:\n\n1.  Submit a proposal to become a Sequencer on the  _Metis Governance forum_  using the  **Infrastructure**  proposal type ([**Infrastructure**  proposals - CEG - Metis.io (ceg.vote)](https://ceg.vote/c/infrastructure-sequencer/30))\n\n2.  [Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/metislayer2.eth)  proposal\n\n3.  Pass the vote\n\n## Offboarding\n\nOffboarding a Sequencer can occur automatically through detection of misconduct by client software or be community-initiated via a Governance proposal on the Metis Governance forum using the following steps:\n\n1.  Submit a CVP proposal to offboard a Sequencer on the  _Metis Governance forum_  using the Governance proposal type ([Governance proposals - CEG - Metis.io (ceg.vote)](https://ceg.vote/c/governance-proposals/28))\n\n2.  [Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/metislayer2.eth)  proposal\n\n-   Voting duration - 72 hours\n\n3.  Pass the vote\n\n-   See the  **Voting criteria**  above\n\nOffboarded Sequencers can appeal using the information in the Impeachments/Appealing process paragraph.\n\n## Rewards/Mining Rate Adjustment\n\n  \nThe Rewards/Mining Rate Adjustment mechanism incentivizes Sequencer participation, balancing the network’s economy, enhancing engagement, and security. It features a 20% estimated Mining Rewards Rate (MRR), crucial for proposing adjustments to maintain network efficiency and sustainability.\n\n-   **Adjustment Mechanism**: Updates to the per-block reward aim to maintain the Mining Rewards Rate (MRR) at 20%, using a dynamic system influenced by network performance, demand, and economic factors.\n-   **Governance Role**: Reward adjustments are managed through governance, with the community or groups proposing changes and voting to determine optimal reward levels for network integrity and competitiveness.\n-   **Incentive Structure**: The reward adjustment process seeks to harmonize network security, operational efficiency, and Sequencer incentives by evaluating lock-up needs, costs, and METIS tokenomics.\n\n## Product/Operations parameters changing\nAdjustments to Product/Operations Parameters are made to manage the network's technical and operational aspects effectively. This includes:\n\n1.  **Technical Updates**: Enhancing system setups for better Sequencer performance and security, pending technical review and community consent.\n2.  **Lock-up Requirements and Governance**: Adjusting METIS token lock-up thresholds to balance economic incentives with network security and open access for newcomers.\n3.  **Operational Improvement**: Upgrading operational practices for Sequencer efficiency, possibly through governance proposals informed by technology advances or feedback.\n\n## Slashing\n\nThis list outlines potential malicious or poor-performance actions by Sequencer nodes, with a default response to remove and review such Sequencers. A Governance proposal will determine the handling of these cases, inviting community input for additional rules or modifications via further proposals.\n\n### Low Severity\n\n#### Slow Sequencers\n\nSequencers with poor configuration or network conditions may produce blocks slowly, causing performance issues for the network. These nodes will be contacted and encouraged to upgrade their configuration. If a Sequencer falls behind, it cannot pack blocks and will not receive rewards.\n\n### Medium Severity\n\n#### Non-Block Production and Reelection\n\nIf a Sequencer fails to produce a block within the set threshold (60 seconds), another node triggers a reelection, which sequencers vote on, requiring a ⅔ majority. This process is automated for detection and action.\n\n### High Severity\n\n#### Multiple Node Outages\n\nIf several nodes, amounting to about ⅓ of Sequencers, go offline simultaneously due to malicious intent, they face harsher penalties, determined programmatically and further defined by community-led Governance proposals.\n\n### Critical Severity\n\n#### Malicious Execution Result Modification\n\nIf a node modifies the execution result of a block, it will fail validation by other Sequencers. This will cause a halt in its block production and interrupt the current epoch. This triggers a re-election process. The node will then be forced to produce a new block with the correct execution result. The case would be detected and acted upon programmatically.\n\n### Undefined Severity\n\n#### Sandwich Attack\nIf a node alters a block's execution result, failing other Sequencers' validation, it stops producing blocks, interrupting the epoch and triggering a re-election. The node must then correct the block, with detection and action taken automatically.\n\n## Slashing rules\n\nProgrammatic bad action handling is coded into the Sequencer client software and when these cases are detected, the Sequencers would:\n\n1.  Slash X% amount of the Sequencer’s stake depending on the offence\n2.  [if applicable] Blacklist the Sequencer from running a node\n3.  [if applicable] Kick the Sequencer out of consensus\n\n \n![Снимок экрана 2024-03-12 в 17.57.26.png](ipfs://bafkreiel6foordk77wd7i5wfwxfdb2vgqsiexef5thpizh234sxtlfnlxq)\n    \n\n## Impeachments/Appealing process\n\nSlashed Sequencers can gather evidence and arguments and appeal the slash on a  _Metis Governance forum_  using the Governance proposal type. Metis Foundation and Community can decide whether or not to refund the slashed tokens and reinstate the Sequencer.\n\nIn some cases, the affected Sequencer may apply for a reward reimbursement.\n\n# Slashed Token Handling\n\nThe slashed tokens would be locked for a year and then released into the treasury.\n\n# LST pairing\n\nThe Metis team has set up a process in which node operators may be paired with Liquid Staking Tokens protocols, opening the door for the staked tokens to come from users.

      "title": "Ecosystem Proposal: Chaineye Mini Bridge",
      "content": "Introduction\n\nChaineye Mini Bridge is designed to provide the cheapest and fastest solution for small-amount cross-chain transfers as well as native gas swaps. Launched in October 2023, the mini bridge already has a total of TX 387K, unique users 77K, and website MAU 100K by Similarweb. Chaineye Mini Bridge is rated the top 1 bridge by dappsheriff.com during Linea Voyager Campaign.\n\nProject Resources\nWebsite: https://minibridge.chaineye.tools/ 2\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Chaineye_tools\nTelegram: Telegram: Contact @chaineye\nGithub: DeFiEye · GitHub 1\nDocumentation: https://docs.chaineye.tools/\n\nKey Features\nChaineye was born from the Web3 community and we build products for the community’s needs. To better serve the community, Chaineye has built many free tools such as Onchain Map, CEX Transfer Fees, Multichain Gas, RPC List, etc. The Mini Bridge was designed specifically for retail investors with small-amount cross-chain transfer requests, including the following features:\n\nZero bridge fees: We don’t charge any bridge fees at all. This means users will get the same amount of assets on the destination chains. We are built for retail investors and we believe our community like free services. Only a minimum gas fee on the destination chain is charged.\n\nFastest transactions: Our bridge has the fastest bridging experience across all existing bridges. The bridging time largely depends on the confirmation time of source and destination blockchains. We don’t want our users to wait any longer than the evitable blockchain transaction time.\nDesigned especially for small-amount transfer scenarios such as gas refill, airdrop claiming, moving funds, etc. It helps to save huge money and time for individual investors when doing so.\n\nGas swap: Our community wants to use the destination chain directly after bridging. We get it! The gas swap feature allows users to swap a small amount of source chain ETH to the destination chain native gas token. It is very useful for those chains where ETH is not the native gas token such as BNB Chain, Polygon, ZetaChain, ZkFair, Avalanche, Map, Mantle, and Metis.\n\nFast Integration: Our team is monitoring the market closely and is ready to integrate the latest blockchains in time. Chaineye Mini Bridge currently supports a total of 24 networks including the latest Blast EVM L2 and Merlin BTC L2 blockchain.\n\nOpen API: We have opened the API docs on our documentation site. Any individuals or third parties can go through the API and seamlessly integrate Mini Bridge into their application. Chaineye Mini Bridge works in the same style for both requests from our front-end UI and API endpoints.\n\nSecurity: To prevent the potential security concern of smart contracts, we have implemented our bridge in a hybrid style - a combination of EOA and smart contracts. EOA for cross-chain transfers and smart contracts for cross-chain gas swaps. It helps to reduce the possibility of contract exploitation. In addition, we have our entire system audited and scrutinized by our security partners.\n\nRewards and Earn: Our users can enjoy a big bridge discount by participating in our various marketing campaigns. In addition, they can also earn referral rewards in ETH and $pMNB whenever their referred address makes a transfer. Everything is transparent and Chaineye Mini Bridge is built for the community.\nValue Proposition\n\nChaineye mini bridge extend its liquidity aggregation services to Metis, enabling community users on all other chains to interact with the Metis ecosystem. We are aiming to foster collaboration and engagement between our respective communities, helping Metis and Chaineye users to transfer their assets freely across any supported blockchains with lowest fees and higest speed.\n\nChaineye Mini Bridge was born from the community and built for the community. Our web3 community BitEye having over 300K active users is the largest Asian crypto community. Mini bridge will help bring BitEye to Metis ecosystem with many highlights and marketing resources which helps both sides to grow into the next level.\n\nConclusion\nIn summary, Chaineye Mini Bridge represents a paradigm shift in the realm of cross-chain transfers and swaps, offering a streamlined solution especially for retail investors navigating the complexities of many different blockchains in the crypto landscape. With its user-centric design, cutting-edge technology, and steadfast commitment to innovation, Mini Bridge is poised to serve the community to its best extent. We hope to invite Metis to join our journey as we revolutionize how the world interacts with digital assets.",

      "content": "Nomis 101\n\nPersonalized web3\nNomis.cc 2 builds a personalized web3 enabling users to leverage their onchain traction as they do with real-world credentials and social networks. Imagine the next Internet, where you can not only take advantage of decentralization, but also expect web3 products to deliver meaningful experiences based on who you are onchain.\n\nSolution\nNomis employs AI-driven mathematical modeling tech to assign a reputation score (0-100) to a wallet based on its transaction history. The higher the reputation score, the more onchain traction its owner has.\n\nFriendly: no KYC or web2 social credentials required to get your onchain reputation.\n\nDynamic: your reputation score updates as you perform onchain actions.\n\nComprehensive: your DeFi, SocialFi and GameFi activities on top TVL blockchains are taken into account.\n\nHow it works\nCollecting wallet onchain data: we collect wallet transaction history and other related data from 45 top TVL blockchains and more than 50 sources including explorers and third parties.\n\nReputation scoring: we leverage AI-driven mathematical models that evaluate wallets based on over 30 parameters and assign a reputation score from 0 to 100. Computations are 100% offchain.\n\nAssigning onchain reputation to a wallet: scores are available to developers through Nomis API.\n\nDelivering value to onchain reputation: users can take advantage of their onchain reputation within dapps and protocols integrated Nomis API to personalize their products and communities.\nTraction\n\nNomis’ sybil prevention solutions have received 20+ hackathon awards and grants from Solana Foundation, AAVE, Polygon DAO, MetaCartel DAO, and the HBAR Foundation.\n\n105k+ unique wallets have minted 120k+ Nomis Scores in form of SBT on top TVL networks.\n\nNomis is an official wallet data provider for Galxe.com.\n\nNomis is one of the top Proof-of-Humanity attestors for Linea Voyage.\n\nNomis hosts sybil-resistant quests for 20+ projects on its own platform (ScoreFront), trusted by Symbiosis, Rubic, OmniBTC, ReHold, eesee, and other top projects.\n\nTeam\nAlex Barabash, Co-Founder & CEO, is a serial entrepreneur and mathematician who led a SaaS company that provided scoring services to the HR industry and developed an AI system that automated and data-driven HR decision making.\n\nArty Shatilov, Co-Founder & CPO, is a crypto native and experienced product manager who co-founded and led product development at KickCity, an events platform on Ethereum (NFT tickets, ERC20 referral tokens), and KREO.digital, an AR/VR creative studio that worked with Huawei, Subway, Mazda and Redbull, and launched a profitable online course for AR developers.\n\nFedor Cherepanov, Ph.D., Co-Founder & CTO, is a senior software developer (15+ years of experience) with extensive experience in AI and blockchain engineering, co-authored 40+ scientific papers on AI, and holds 8 patent certificates for artificial neural network software.\n\nEngineering team: 2 UX/UI, 2 frontend, 1 backend and sc.\n\nBD & Marketing team: 3 generalists.\n\nMetis Reputation Scorer\nNomis proposes to build a wallet reputation scorer for Metis. The scorer will help Metis users to build, manage and leverage their txs history; Metis builders with\ndeveloping more personalized and engaging products;\nidentifying sybils and non-sticky users within their communities;\ndistributing airdrops and incentives in a fair, onchain reputation-based, and ROI-efficient manner;\ngetting an influx of 100k+ onchain power users (Nomis Score holders) for their project.\n\nReference: zkSync Reputation Scorer 1, evaluates wallet chain activity within the zkSync network, reflects how much a particular wallet looks like a zkSync power user (degen), and helps its projects and communities highlight and engage with onchain power users.",

      "title": "Infrastructure - LSD Proposal: ENKI",
      "content": "Executive Summary\nMetis’ decentralized Proof of Stake (PoS) sequencer pool, a cornerstone of its blockchain infrastructure, offers enhanced network decentralization and stability through a multi-sequencer system. This model permits users to partake in sequencer benefits directly. However, the complexity and high entry threshold of becoming a sequencer node—requiring a minimum stake of 20,000 METIS tokens and passing through election and whitelist verification—render it inaccessible to the average user.\n\nENKI introduces a groundbreaking Liquid Staking Derivative (LSD) protocol, setting a new standard for participation and liquidity in the Metis ecosystem. As the first of its kind, ENKI aims to revolutionize how users engage with DeFi by removing technical barriers and democratizing access to staking rewards. Our protocol is designed not only to simplify the participation process but also to enhance the rewards for all participated users. By integrating with Metis, ENKI leverages the platform’s advanced Layer 2 features to offer a seamless and efficient staking experience via the Sequencer Node Ecosystem.\n\nUser Earnings and Participation Mechanism\nENKI’s user-friendly interface and straightforward staking process mean participants need not understand the intricacies of sequencer node operations to earn passive income. Users stake METIS tokens, which are then converted into eMETIS, entitling them to staking rewards. Further restaking of eMETIS into seMETIS amplifies their earnings potential, adhering to ENKI’s unique distribution rules.\n\nUpon earnings claims, 70% of eMETIS is credited instantly, with the remaining 30% allocated to the eMETIS Vesting contract. This structure not only highlights the additional utility of ENKI tokens in enhancing profits but also promotes long-term engagement within the ecosystem.\n\nFurthermore, ENKI is committed to enhance liquidity by encouraging users to pair their eMETIS with METIS tokens, generating additional revenue streams through staking and liquidity provision within Metis ecosystem DEXs.\n\nInnovative Features of ENKI\nENKI offers a suite of features designed to optimize user experience and maximize rewards, including:\n\nSimplified Staking with eMetis&seMetis: Users can easily stake METIS tokens to earn rewards, without the need for technical know-how.\nDual Revenue Streams: By participating in ENKI, users can access staking rewards and liquidity mining benefits, enhancing their income potential.\nDecentralized Governance: ENKI token holders will have a say in the protocol’s future development and decision-making processes, ensuring alignment with community interests.\nThe interdependence between Metis and ENKI strengthens the ecosystem, with ENKI’s contributions expected to be a linchpin in Metis’ DeFi strategy. As acknowledged by Metis, “LSD will be the cornerstone of the Metis DeFi ecosystem,” underscoring the critical role of protocols like ENKI in realizing this vision.\n\nENKI Genesis Plan: Fantasy - Overview\nAs part of our launch strategy, ENKI introduced the Genesis Plan: Fantasy, designed to incentivize early supporters and participants. This program is a testament to our commitment to rewarding our community and fostering active participation from the outset. For more details on the program and how to participate, please visit here 12.\n\nConclusion\nENKI is poised to redefine the landscape of decentralized finance on the Metis platform. By bridging the gap between complexity and accessibility, we aim to usher in a new era of participation in DeFi. Our mission is grounded in the belief that everyone should have the opportunity to benefit from the innovations within the Metis ecosystem, and through ENKI, we are making this belief a reality.\n\nStay Connected with ENKI:\n\nExplore our Website: https://enkixyz.com/ 16\nExplore Testnet: https://testnet.enkixyz.com 6\nEngage on Telegram: Telegram: Join Group Chat 6\nFollow our X updates: https://twitter.com/ENKIProtocol 1\nRead in-depth on Medium: ENKI – Medium 4\nJoin us as we redefine DeFi.",

      "title": "Infrastructure - LSD Proposal: Artemis",
      "content": "Artemis Finance\nArtemis Finance is a liquid staking protocol designed exclusively for Metis Decentralised Sequencer Pools. Users can stake their METIS token on Artemis Finance and receive the liquid token - artMETIS.\n\nArtemis offers METIS holders a streamlined opportunity to participate in the Decentralized Sequencer and earn profits. Simultaneously, participating users will receive a liquid wrapper called artMETIS, which automatically accumulates earnings. This single-wrapper mechanism provides a simpler and more unified user experience, eliminating the need for additional costs to incentivize liquidity across multiple wrappers. This approach makes it easier to build a robust DeFi usage scenario.\n\nWebsite: https://artemisfinance.io/ 17\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Artemisfinance 14\n\nArtemis Advantages\nWhile earning staking rewards through participation in the Decentralized Sequencer, users can maximize the efficiency of fund deployment by engaging in various activities on the Metis chain through artMETIS.\nThe artMETIS, being yield-bearing and following a single-token model, promotes greater liquidity concentration and uniformity. Additionally, earnings are automatically reinvested, providing a more user-friendly experience.\nRooted in community-driven principles, Artemis is set for a fair launch. In the future, Artemis Token holders can stake or lock their tokens to receive a share of the protocol-generated fees. Importantly, it serves as a crucial tool for protocol governance.\n\nTokenomics (see in https://ceg.vote/t/lsd-proposal-artemis/1693)\n\nGo-to-market Strategy\nThe strategy is designed to attract more participation in Metis staking while allowing users to leverage artMETIS in the versatile world of DeFi.\n\nLaunching Campaign\nWe will be running a launching campaign to obtain market share and build a community of early adopters. A referral program and guild scheme will be introduced in the campaign. Participants who contribute to the campaign will earn loyalty points, which can be redeemed for IDO allocations and airdrop.\nStrategic Partnerships\nWe will collaborate with DeFi projects, liquidity providers, and yield optimization platforms to increase liquidity and expand the user base. Our existing liquidity partners include Dewhales Capital (an anonymous DAO of top 100 debank addresses), AlfaDAO, and Benmo Labs.\nExpanded Use Cases of artMETIS\nLaunch artMETIS/METIS pool on DEXes with liquidity farming incentives;\nList artMETIS on Pendle and enable the yield trading;\nList artMETIS on lending protocol as eligible collateral.\nEcosystem Additions and Synergies\nArtemis Finance is incubated and backed by NGAD, a foundation DAO dedicated to pioneering the future of asset growth and expanding the horizons of Liquid Staked Tokens ecosystems. NGAD’s other members protocols include Equilibria Finance and Euclid Finance, both will play pivotal roles in creating synergistic effects within the Metis Ecosystem and further bolster the growth of Artemis.\n\nThe following brief introductions to Equilibria and Euclid will provide a glimpse into their instrumental roles and value propositions. For more details, please visit the attached links.\n\nEquilibria Finance: Growth Engine for LSDFi\nEquilibria is a protocol built on top of Pendle Finance and is designed to enhance the yields of LPs through the accumulation of vePENDLE tokens. The main goal is to create a win-win scenario where all participants benefit, making yields more attractive and accessible to a broader range of users. It has reached a TVL exceeding $100M and is now available on Ethereum, Arbitrum, BNB Chain and Optimism.\n\nLSD-in-one and Growth Engine\n\nEquilibria is committed to expanding its offerings by integrating and promoting high-quality LSD and LRT assets. By assisting these assets in gaining traction within the liquidity landscape, Equilibria aims to accelerate their growth and, in doing so, enhance the broader DeFi ecosystem.\n\nWe believe our presence serves as a flywheel in value creation across the LSD ecosystem, by maximising capital efficiency and aligning economic incentives across all market players.\n\nWebsite:https://equilibria.fi/ 3\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Equilibriafi 2\nDefillama: https://defillama.com/protocol/equilibria 4\n\nEuclid Finance: New Standard for Ethereum Restaking\nEuclid Finance is a comprehensive solution that simplifies the restaking process, offers an omnichain liquid asset (elETH) representing restaked positions, and establishes a trustless and permissionless operator network. Euclid aims to enhance the accessibility, security, and decentralization of EigenLayer.\n\nEuclid has two major features that set it apart from other protocols:\n\n1. elETH is a omnichain liquid asset\n\nelETH is a yield-bearing liquid wrapper representing the restaking position. With Euclid, users can deposit their ETH and LSTs from different networks without worrying about bridging or gas fees.\n\n2. Trustless and Permissionless Operator Network\n\nEuclid enables restakers to delegate their assets to various operators. Operators must stake ECL (Euclid’s governance token) and restake ETH/LST independently, which then serve as security deposits, ensuring the operators’ eligibility and competence in fulfilling their responsibilities. This mechanism not only protects restakers’ interests but also incentivizes operators with ECL staking rewards and commission earnings from restakers.\n\nWebsite: https://euclidfinance.io/ 1\nLitepaper: Litepaper - Euclid Finance\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Euclidfi\n\nConclusion\nArtemis Finance stands ready to create a profound impact within the Metis ecosystem. With a clear vision to empower the decentralized sequencer and expand the use case of METIS, we are driven to catalyze the widespread adoption of liquid staked METIS. We are excited about the potential of Artemis Finance and will continue contribute to the continued growth and development of the Metis ecosystem.\n\nLooking forward to the possibility of working together to bring Artemis Finance’s vision to fruition.",

Omnichain Flexibility\nMint LSTs omnichain (initially, on the Ethereum & Metis Network).\nSeamlessly transfer stMETIS between different blockchain networks using the xERC20 standard 1.\n\nstMETIS Utility & Integrations\nAs we gear up for the official launch of omnichain stMETIS liquid staking on Metis and Ethereum mainnets, and subsequently on other EVM chains where METIS will flourish, our roadmap is brimming with exciting integrations and innovations:\n\nConnect Metis and Curve ecosystems\n– stMETIS integrations with Curve Finance, Convex Finance, Stake DAO, crvUSD, and other protocols\n– Additional CRV/CVX/SDT rewards for stMETIS/METIS pool\nIntegrations with lending protocols: Aave, Granary, crvUSD, Inverse Finance, Silo Finance, and others\nCross-chain stMETIS transfers with the xERC20 standard without liquidity fragmentation\nLeveraged Staking Strategies (built on top of stMETIS lending markets)\nAdditional ACFI rewards for stMETIS liquid stakers\nIntegrations with institutional crypto custodians and market-makers (Anchorage.com 1 and others)\nIntegrations with exchanges (easy METIS staking on Gate.io with stMETIS liquid staking underneath)\nACFI – Accumulated Finance Governance Token\nACFI will be launched in 2024 and operate under a carefully designed tokenomics model, shaping the distribution and utility of the native cryptocurrency.\n\n50,000,000 ACFI tokens will be distributed to liquid staking users.\n\nBy staking ACFI in stACFI, users contribute to the decentralized decision-making process that governs the development and evolution of Accumulated Finance and directly share protocol revenue (across all liquid staking tokens).\n\nLinks\nWebsite: https://accumulated.finance \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/AccumulatedFi \nDocs: https://docs.accumulated.finance \n\nConclusion\nAccumulated Finance is not just a liquid staking protocol, it’s a movement to unlock the true value of staked tokens. We are pioneering omnichain liquid staking, providing seamless interoperability for stMETIS across multiple blockchain networks.\n\nThe integration with the Curve ecosystem amplifies liquidity and utility for stMETIS holders, while our roadmap includes further enhancements, from multiple CeDeFi integrations to leveraged staking strategies.\n\nWith the upcoming launch of the ACFI governance token and rewards for liquid staking users, it’s a good time for the METIS community to integrate with Accumulated Finance, unlocking a lot of utilities for staked METIS and synergies with our ecosystem.",

      "title": "Infrastructure - LSD Proposal: Velix",
      "content": "Background\nThe dynamics of Defi staking has changed rapidly and the Metis network having emerged as a promising Layer 2 set to decentralize its sequencers presents colossal opportunity for money markets and defi explorers looking to explore staking opportunities. Taking inspiration from the popular Metis quote\" “LSD will be the cornerstone of the Metis DeFi ecosystem \" Velix introduces innovative solution: a liquid staking derivative (LSD) platform designed to simplify and enhance the staking experience of users within the Metis ecosystem. By enabling METIS token holders to participate in network security without sacrificing liquidity, Velix not only enhances financial product flexibility but also democratizes access to DeFi benefits through the Velix Protocol.\n\nVelix Protocol Mechanism\n\nYield maximization through staking is at the heart of Velix’s innovation, allowing users who ordinarily would not be able to participate in sequencer mining due to minimum staking requirements to stake their METIS tokens in exchange for veMETIS, a tokenized derivative. This process is underpinned by a sophisticated algorithm that delegates METIS tokens to high-performance sequencers, ensuring network security and consensus efficiency. veMETIS holders can further stake their tokens for sveMETIS, representing their stake and accruing rewards, thus maintaining liquidity and active participation in the DeFi ecosystem.\n\nGraphical representation of the Velix Protocol Mechanism\n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreicepqrfmaztorjzt454lp7zp4gd5bz2tighuunbt3whqjapgmh2ua)\n\nKey Components:\nThe guide outlines the simple process a user needs to go through to participate in Velix\nToken Deposit and Mint: Secure delegation of METIS tokens to sequencers via Velix, enhancing network integrity.\nLSD Issuance (veMETIS): Minting of veMETIS, enabling liquidity and seamless DeFi ecosystem engagement.\nReward Distribution: Auto-compounded rewards distributed in veMETIS to sveMETIS holders, amplifying yield potential.\n\nUnique Features\n\nEnhanced Yield through Auto-compounding, offerring a superior return on staked Metis.\n\nveMETIS issuance provides uninterrupted Liquidity for users, allowing for greater flexibility in utilizing staked asset (veMetis) across various DeFi applications within Metis ecosystem\n\nSeamless integration within the Metis ecosystem, facilitating interoperability and fluid exchange across DeFi platforms.\n\n4.Introduction of the Velix governance token to empower users to shape the protocol’s future while incentivizing contributions to protocol security, efficiency and the overall democracy.\n\nTokenomics will soon be released for detailed overview\n\nConnect with us\nWebsite https://www.velix.io/\nTelegram\nDiscord\nTestnet (Coming soon)",

      "title": "Infrastructure - LSD Proposal: StaFi",
      "content": "Introduction\nStaFi protocol is a liquid staking protocol for multiple POS blockchains. StaFi aims to solve the contradiction between Mainnet security and token liquidity in PoS consensus.\n\nUsers can stake PoS tokens through StaFi and receive rTokens in return, which are available for trading, while still earning staking rewards. rToken is a synthetic staking derivative issued by StaFi to users when users stake PoS tokens through StaFi rToken App 1 . rTokens are anchored to the PoS tokens staked by users and the corresponding staking rewards. rTokens can be transferred and traded at any time.\n\nTo date, the platform has released up to 10 various liquid staking solutions including rETH (StaFi Staked ETH), rMATIC, rBNB, rATOM, among others.\n\n \n![image](ipfs://bafybeickp7hqqvoj4lz7b3sr4677ksili57kab3ij3nsnjy2kt4ejm7req)\n\nSpecification\n\nCVP\nhttps://ceg.vote/t/cvp-proposal-new-metis-lst-rmetis-by-stafi/1594\n\nLiquid Staking as a Service\nStaFi 2.0 will introduce LSD development frameworks and Liquid Staking as a Service (LSAAS), supporting ETH, EVM, and CosWasm. This will significantly reduce the complexity of LSD development, enabling quick deployment. The framework will also support METIS and introduce Liquid Staking as a Service (LSAAS) for METIS.\n\nCheck more details: https://mirror.xyz/0xBABf7e6b5bcE0BD749FD3C527374bEf8919cC7A9/bNtJk4LKO8DPW9so57eyLlltDdR8hkBe9jTrZNUv5UM\n\nrMETIS\nUsers can deposit METIS on the StaFi Protocol without any limitations based on their capacity. The deposited METIS is subsequently staked by StaFi’s staking contract, which autonomously selects the optimal sequencers to generate and maximize staking yields.\n\nUsers who deposit METIS on StaFi will receive an equivalent amount of rMETIS (rToken StaFi equivalent) to the value they staked. rMETIS is an erc20 and rebase token. Subsequently, users can freely trade rMETIS (rToken equivalent) or provide liquidity (LP) to earn additional yield. This additional yield can be staked alongside our reputable DEX partners on METIS.\n\nMore\nWebsite: https://stafi.io\nrToken App: https://app.stafi.io 1\nDocument: https://docs.stafi.io 2\nDeFilama: https://defillama.com/protocol/stafi 1\nDune: https://dune.com/stafi-analysis/stafi\nGithub: stafiprotocol · GitHub\nAudit: security/audits at main · stafiprotocol/security · GitHub 1\nrLaunchpad: New rToken on rLaunchpad - StaFi Protocol Governance",

      "title": "Ecosystem Proposal: Renzo - The EigenLayer Liquid Restaking Hub",
      "content": "Renzo - The EigenLayer Liquid Restaking Hub\n\nIntroduction\n\nRenzo is a Liquid Restaking Token (LRT) and Strategy Manager for EigenLayer. It is the interface to the EigenLayer ecosystem securing Actively Validated Services (AVSs) and offering a higher yield than ETH staking. The protocol simplifies all complexities for the end-user and fosters seamless collaboration between them and EigenLayer node operators.\n\nWhat is EigenLayer?\n\nEigenlayer simplifies collaboration between innovators and Ethereum's stakers and node operators, enabling multiple parties who lack mutual trust to collaborate and achieve meaningful outcomes. By providing a straightforward means to leverage Ethereum's 'decentralized trust' module, Eigenlayer promotes open innovation, eliminating the necessity for protocols to establish their validator set and granting easy access to Ethereum's computational and financial resources.\n\nHow do LRT and ezETH work?\n\nFor every LST or ETH deposited on Renzo, it mints an equivalent amount of ezETH.\n\nezETH is the liquid restaking token representing a user’s restaked position at Renzo. Users can deposit native ETH or LSTs and receive ezETH.\n\n### Rewards\n\n* ezETH is a reward-bearing token similar to cTokens\n* The underlying restaking positions earn rewards which are reflected in the price of ezETH\n  * Rewards are expected in ETH, USDC and Actively Validated Services (AVSs) reward tokens.\n* This means the value of ezETH increases relative to the underlying LSTs as it earns more rewards in AVS tokens\n* To mint ezETH, simply go to [renzoprotocol.com/restake](https://app.renzoprotocol.com/restake) and stake your ETH or LSTs\n\n### Withdrawals\n\n* Depending on the restaking strategies deployed, unstaking will take a minimum of 7 days, primarily due to EigenLayer unstaking requirements, but will vary depending on each AVS.\n* If the deposits and withdrawals are balanced, the rewards are equally distributed regardless of the asset being withdrawn.\n* If the deposits and withdrawals are unbalanced, while the principal will be withdrawn in whole the rewards are different for each asset incentivizing the balance based on the[ jump rate model](https://ianm.com/posts/2020-12-20-understanding-compound-protocols-interest-rates)\n\n#### Transfers\n\n* Please note, ezETH withdrawals are not enabled. You are encouraged to supply liquidity or sell ezETH on Balancer, that offers a superior mechanism to convert ezETH into ETH for most cases. Visit the ezETH/WETH[ Balancer Pool](https://app.balancer.fi/#/ethereum/pool/0x596192bb6e41802428ac943d2f1476c1af25cc0e000000000000000000000659).\n\n### Fees\n\n* Renzo passes 100% of any EigenLayer rewards\n* Renzo is built to be prThe fees will be split between protocol reserves (treasury) and Renzo node operators\n\n \n![1.jpeg](ipfs://bafkreidvpdbme7lyla33wo7bfnx5g3rl6rshj2mn4qozhzsa7l2excufye)\n    \n\nPrimary on-ramp / off-ramp for Ethereum restaking, using a combination of smart contracts and operator nodes to secure the best risk / reward restaking strategy.\n\n \n![2.jpeg](ipfs://bafkreiblgx7drnzmndqpvxwr72gzglxih2apzoska7knkjlfhbiiynbyfe)\n    \n\nBenefits for Metis Ecosystem\n\nMetis plans to partner with EigenLayer both to adopt EigenLayer as its Data Availability provider, and to enable dual-layer liquid staking on the Metis network, a first for any L2. At the same time, Metis is rolling out a Liquid Staking Blitz, where it’s courting top liquid staking protocols to deploy both liquid-staked ETH and liquid-staked METIS on the Metis network, with liquid-staked METIS being paired with Metis’ soon-to-launch decentralized sequencer. Renzo will thus pair with EigenLayer to enable liquid restaking of both ETH and METIS on the Metis network.\n\nBenefits for Users\n\n* Users can hold ezETH in your wallet to collect rewards, swap or supply ezETH on DEXs, or participate in DeFi opportunities as ezETH is integrated into more DeFi applications\n* Users can restake as little or as much ETH as they want, or stake LSTs according to the maximum cap amount, set by Renzo\n* Renzo passes 100% of any EigenLayer points\n\nAudits\n\nRenzo has gone through comprehensive audits:\n\nhttps://github.com/HalbornSecurity/PublicReports/blob/master/Solidity%20Smart%20Contract%20Audits/Renzo_Protocol_EVM_Contracts_Smart_Contract_Security_Assessment_Report_Halborn_Final.pdf\n\nLinks\n\nWebsite: https://www.renzoprotocol.com/\n\nDocs: https://docs.renzoprotocol.com/docs/\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/RenzoPr0tocol\n\nApp: https://app.renzoprotocol.com/restake\n\nGithub: https://github.com/Renzo-Protocol\n\nBlog: https://mirror.xyz/renzoprotocol.eth",

      "content": "![f46e3e2989cd6b7339ea374c996c180ac94301e5_2_690x358.jpeg](ipfs://bafybeicwfzmzljavzjpz4qxgv75cybdhmok4d42rvcvgjvrf7ecy35zt2m)\n\n\n**Introduction**\n\nZeno is a native Perpetual DEX on Metis, powered by the cutting-edge HMX technology. The imminent launch of a decentralized sequencer framework, the projected expansion of Total Value Locked (TVL) and user base for Metis create the perfect timing for Zeno’s debut. The strategic decision to launch Zeno now is made to harness the momentum of the ecosystem’s growth, leveraging HMX’s success on Arbitrum, positioning Zeno to fulfill its aspiration to be the #1 Decentralized Leveraged Trading platform on Metis.\n    \n**Zeno’s Features:**\n\n1. **Leveraged Trading:** Zeno's leveraged trading feature is powered by HMX's technology, which has facilitated ~$14 billion in total trading volume on Arbitrum. Renowned for its versatility and comprehensiveness, this decentralized trading feature stands out in the industry by delivering an exceptional user experience. It closely replicates the perpetual trading experience on centralized exchanges (CEXes) without compromising the advantages of decentralization.\n\nZeno's leveraged trading feature incorporates several sub-features to enhance the overall trading experience, and it is the only decentralized protocol on Metis offering all these features:\n\n  1. **Cross-margin support:** Share margin balances across multiple positions to maximize capital efficiency for traders, especially during periods of high volatility.\n  2. **Multi-asset collateral support:** Use BTC, ETH, USDT and many other assets as collateral for trading, allowing users to effectively implement many trade strategies.\n  3. **Progressive web app (PWA):** Create an app-like experience for mobile users, mimicking an experience of trading on a CEX application without losing the benefits of decentralization.\n  4. **Gasless trading & order management:** Trade and manage order on Zeno through an intent-based architecture without worrying about funding wallet with gas.\n  5. **Subaccount support:** Trade using different sub accounts under the same wallet address, creating a better user-experience and convenience for position risk management.\n  6. **Python SDK API:** Allow traders to use Zeno as their preferred platform for automated and algorithmic trading, increasing the trading volume for the platform.\n  7. **Account abstraction:** Allow for one-click trading through account abstraction to mimic the experience of using a CEX.\n  8. On-chart trading: Provide users with the ability to adjust their TP/SL price by click & drag on the chart.\n\n\n \n![d1015e674b8e56015c9177e6ed98279b97b903ec_2_690x387.jpeg](ipfs://bafybeiamb72der7kln5nsu6mrlrkpblzo3xoft3z2wyvehkmwpxznixdzu)\n    \n\n2. **Swap:** Zeno allows users to swap assets on Zeno with no price impact across supported assets, including BTC, ETH, and stablecoins.\n\n3. **Market Making (ZLP):** The ZLP vault serves as the market-making liquidity for traders on the Zeno platform. The reserved liquidity in the ZLP is utilized to distribute profits to traders. Conversely, in cases where traders face losses, their collateral is seized and added to the ZLP, as counter trading profits. In exchange for taking on counterparty risks, depositors earn trading fees, borrowing fees, and swap fees generated by traders.\n\nZeno’s ZLP vault is protected by a unique combination of 7 LP-protection mechanisms, as follow:\n\n  1. **Max Utilization Limit:** Zeno reserves liquidity in ZLP for traders’ profits payout. Once the limit is reached, opening new positions are restricted, maintaining enough buffer liquidity for LPs to withdraw.\n  2. **Auto Deleverage (ADL):** Triggers automatic closing of in-profit positions based on protocol-defined criteria, limiting downside risk to LPs and supporting higher trading volume.\n  3. **Profit Reserve Buffer:** Monitors net current traders’ global PnL against the LP pool. When reaching a percentage threshold relative to TVL, auto deleveraging begins, starting with in-profit positions.\n  4. **Open Interest Limit:** Sets separate OI limits for each market's short and long sides, preventing excessive OI beyond predefined levels.\n  5. **Velocity-based Funding Rate:** Charges traders based on their position size and direction to balance long and short OI, reducing LP exposure to one market side.\n  6. **Adaptive Pricing:** Incentivize traders to open positions that help balance the long and short OI by applying premium/discount on the oracle price when traders open / close a position.\n  7. **Adaptive Trading Fees:** Fees based on trading size relative to the asset liquidity depth on CEX order book to protect LP from potential price manipulation attacks.\n\n**Roadmap:**\nQ1 2024:\n\n* Launch of Public Open Beta: We will launch Zeno with a Public Open Beta, where users can test out our product. During this phase, users who use our platform (trading, LP, swap) will qualify for an esZENO airdrop. Up to 2% of the $esZENO supply will be airdropped to Zeno users based on the total trading volume achieved by the platform.\n\nQ2 2024:\n\n* **ZENO Token Generation Event (TGE):** Users will have the opportunity to contribute their assets in exchange for $ZENO. The TGE will be done either on Zeno website or on a launchpad DEX partner (Hercules) The format will be a fair auction, where participants will all get the same price, with a minimum and maximum FDV set. Extra contribution will be refunded back to participants pro-rata.\n* **ZLP Boost:** Users can commit deposits in the form of accepted cryptocurrencies to the ZLP. The deposits committed in this phase will qualify for additional $esZENO incentives. The amount of $esZENO participants in this phase will earn will depend on the amount of deposits committed and how early the deposit is committed. Bonus $esZENO incentives will be distributed monthly for the period of 1 year. Users can withdraw deposits anytime, but the remaining bonus $esZENO rewards will be distributed among all qualifying participants still remaining in the pool.\n* **Full-scale launch:** After the LP boost is completed, the protocol will start operating at a full scale. The following happens after this phase: $esZENO emission goes live Staking feature goes live Vesting feature goes live Airdrop of $esZENO tokens to participants of the Public Open Beta\n* **API for Trading:** Release Python SDK API to allow users to automate and route trading activities through bots and algorithms via Zeno. \n* **Customized Index Market:** Implement customized onchain index market for users to trade. \n* **Progressive Web App (PWA):** Improved Zeno’s mobile UI to improve the UI/UX to be on par with using a centralized exchange.\n* **Listing on Key Data Sites:** We will list ZENO on key data sites to help broaden the awareness and reach of the protocol and the token.\n\nH2 2024:\n\n* **Centralized Exchange Listing:** Aim to secure listings on centralized exchanges to broaden Zeno's market reach.\n* **Governance:** Introduce governance features, allowing community members to actively participate in decision-making processes to help shape the future direction of Zeno.\n* **Zeno V2:** Develop and launch Zeno V2, incorporating advanced features and improvements based on user feedback and evolving market trends.\n* **Other Undisclosed Features:** Other undisclosed features to be developed and released\n\n**Value Proposition:**\n\nBy leveraging technology from HMX, Zeno’s product is already battle-tested and is proven to have a strong product market fit. HMX has facilitated an impressive $14 billion in total trading volume. This outstanding achievement is a testament to HMX's technological prowess and its ability to provide traders with a seamless and efficient perpetual trading experience.\n\n**HMX’s Statistics & Track Record as of Feb 28th 2024:**\n* Total Trading Volume: $13.90m\n* TVL: $29.0m\n* Number of assets listed: 35+\n* Total revenue distributed to users: $5.5m+\n* Total Unique Users: 5,500+\n* Total No. of Trades Supported: 150,000+\n\nZeno aspires to not only replicate but surpass the accomplishments HMX achieved on Arbitrum. With official support from the Metis team, Zeno aims to become the #1 perpetual DEX on Metis.\n\nBenefits for Users\n\n1. First full-suite battle-tested decentralized perpetual protocol: The Metis community and ecosystem will gain a battle-tested decentralized Perp trading platform with the most complete leveraged trading features, on-par with the experience of trading on centralized exchanges, allowing them to trade cryptocurrencies, FX, and commodities without concerns about centralization risks.\n\n2. Yield generating opportunity for metis community: Community members will have the chance to actively earn real yields from the revenue generated by the protocol. This presents a unique space for users to park their capital and simultaneously generate yield, enhancing their financial strategies and participation within the Metis ecosystem. The yield generating strategy may also attract additional TVL to Metis.\n\n**Security Audits:**\n\nZeno leverages HMX’s technology, whose smart contract has been audited by[ Foobar](https://twitter.com/0xfoobar),[ WatchPug](https://twitter.com/WatchPug_), and[ Cantina](https://twitter.com/cantinaxyz).

      "title": "Ecosystem Proposal: Vector Reserve (The LST Liquidity Layer for Metis - vETH and vMETIS)",
      "content": "**Introducing Vector Reserve - The LST Liquidity Layer for Metis**\n\nVector is a recently launched LST/LRT liquidity layer launched on Ethereum. Vector issues a new type of LST called a Liquidity Position Derivative (vETH). Our intention is to bring vETH to Metis AND launch an equivalent vMETIS LPD in order to become the de facto liquidity layer for LSTfi (and LRTfi) on Metis for both ETH and METIS LSTs (and LRTs). To explain how this would work for vMETIS we have provided an overview of vETH (as the mechanics would be the same).\n\n**How Vector Works:**\n\nvETH is an ETH-pegged token (like Lido's stETH for example) that is backed not by ETH, not by stETH (or any other LST) but by a mix of them, paired with each other as LP positions. Since the entire backing is made up of ETH and ETH-denominated assets, vETH cannot be left undercollateralized by ETH volatility. It is a product designed for people who want diversified, risk adjusted, optimized ETH yields, without sacrificing ETH exposure or risking Impermanent Loss (IL). What makes vETH so special is the diverse sources of yield it accrues:\n\n1. The yield from the LP positions that underly it (trading fees, arbitrage and emissions).\n2. The yield from the LSTs within the LP positions.\n3. Superfluid Staking yield (when enabled by EigenLayer)\n\nBecause vETH derives yield not only from restaking but from LP positions, the yield on vETH should drastically outperform a standard LST or LRT, whilst also creating a highly liquid, tightly pegged and fungible asset for use across DeFi. Given the upcoming Metis sequencers and Metis LST adoption, the vETH model can be easily replicated for vMETIS creating a highly liquid, high yielding METIS derivative that can power LSTfi on Metis.\n\nRegarding the Vector token (VEC), it acts as a value accrual token for the entire platform. VEC maintains a perpetually growing intrinsic value, similar to past iterations of \"reserve currencies\". However, unlike traditional reserve currencies, VEC accrues revenue from additional sources beyond merely bonding.\n\n1. VEC is backed by vETH/ETH LP (and other relevant ETH denominated LPs) - meaning the intrinsic value is perpetually growing with yield accrued.\n2. VEC sells bonds to acquire more vETH/ETH LP (or other accepted ETH denominated LPs) - growing the backing more rapidly.\n3. VEC has a transaction tax that goes towards bribing for LP provision across various DEXs - rapidly scaling VEC liquidity.\n4. 20% of yield generated by the vETH collateral reserves goes towards the VEC token, either as perpetual buyback-and-burn or by staking yield.\n\nThe future introduction of veVEC will enable veVEC holders to vote on and direct liquidity for the LST/LRT market controlled by Vector, leading to a strong liquidity and bribes market for liquidity akin to examples like Curve, Convex and Conic.\n\n**Vector On Metis:**\n\nWe are proposing 2 things that can be very powerful on Metis. The migration/replication of vETH on Metis, and the creation of vMETIS. Both of these are well within our capabilities and we bring with us a number of significant partnerships to rapidly scale LSTfi on Metis.\n\n1. We understand that the Metis team currently has a big focus on bringing LSTs (and LRTs) over to Metis to make it the home of Layer 2 LSTfi. To prevent fragmented liquidity this will require a solid liquidity layer that can build robust and sticky liquidity and DeFi (LSTfi) utility. On the side of ETH this is exactly what Vector and vETH can replicate on Metis as we have done on Ethereum mainnet.\n2. Also the upcoming sequencers will create “METIS staking” and in turn a number of METIS LST derivatives. These two will need a robust liquidity layer to avoid liquidity fragmentation, help incentivize, acquire and direct liquidity and ensure it is sticky and scalable to create the platform for METIS LSTfi. Vector will replicate the vETH model by creating vMETIS, acting as a liquidity blackhole locking in deep, sticky liquidity for METIS LSTs etc., a market akin to an omnipool/bribes model for METIS LSTs, and a platform for the growth of LSTfi utility.\n\n**Benefits For The Metis Ecosystem:**\n\nLaunching vETH and vMETIS brings a number of benefits:\n\n* Bringing established partnerships with LSTs, LRTs and DeFi platforms to help rapidly scale LSTfi on Metis\n* Solving the issue of liquidity fragmentation for ETH and METIS LSTs (and LRTs) by aggregating one liquidity layer under vETH and vMETIS respectively.\n* Creating deep sticky, protocol owned liquidity to lock and rapidly scale TVL for Metis, with lowered risk of capital flight.\n* Introducing an omnipool/bribes model to incentivise liquidity growth and create a robust set of liquidity pools for ETH and METIS LST trading.\n* Creating a highly liquid ETH and METIS LST platform for adoption across DeFi including lending markets etc. enabling further TVL growth and scale.\n\n**Current Partnerships and Integrations:**\n\nWithin one month of launch we have built an ecosystem with a number of blue chip partnerships and integrations across liquidity venues, LSTs, LRTs, and DeFi utility with plenty more to come:\n\n* https://x.com/vectorreserve/status/1760339213294403913?s=20\n\nThis includes a high level of support from some key players in the space such as Balancer and Redacted:\n\n* Balancer - https://x.com/Balancer/status/1760673085131518220?s=20\n* Redacted - https://x.com/redactedcartel/status/1760045645585686697?s=20\n\n**Rapid TVL Growth**\n\nTVL breakdown can be viewed on the DeFi Llama link below, with a brief summary outlined below:\n\n* Defi Llama: https://defillama.com/protocol/vector-reserve \n* vETH TVL: $11,500,000\n* vETH Cumulative Volume: $22,000,000\n* VEC Treasury Backing/POL: $12,000,000\n* Staked VEC: $22,000,000\n\nWe also have a detailed Dune dashboard giving an in-depth view on all protocol stats (please note this is in the process of being updated as add new collaterals and liquidity pools):\n\n* https://dune.com/whale_hunter/vector-reserve\n\n**Security First Approach With Rigorous Audits**\n\nPlease see the links below for our current Ethereum mainnet contracts as well as our current audits (with further audits and bug bounty campaigns planned).

      "title": "Ecosystem Proposal: ASPIS - On-chain Asset Management Toolkit for DAO Funds and Startups",
      "content": "Current crypto projects and funds lack an efficient tool to manage their assets and relationships with investors transparently, and investors have no real control of what is happening with their funds inside the project or fund. Investors transfer their assets at their own risk using ineffective legal contracts with no real protection or even not using any agreements at all.\n\nFounders of crypto projects are not motivated to develop their projects after they successfully raised funds and sometimes do exit scams such as rug pulls or just imitating project activity with no real search of real customers and product-market-fit. Unfortunately, investors are not protected from either of these activities now. Since the current legal system has proven to be costly, ineffective, and not safeguard investors but adding headaches to the founders, another solution needs to be discovered.\n\nInvestment DAOs can address the lack of transparency and align information asymmetry and motivations between investors and fund managers, bringing more control to investors and protecting them from malicious actions performed by bad actors.\n\nCurrent DAO constructors lack mass adoption since they are too general and do not satisfy business or community needs. To develop tailored DAO for a specific project or fund, it must create from scratch, which is costly and ineffective.\n\nTHE PROJECT\n\nASPIS presents a constructor for asset management DAOs (DAOs that store community funds such as funds or project’s treasury of tokens and raised funds). Using our intuitive UI, asset managers can deploy their DAO with all specific parameters for voting, onboarding, and offboarding rules and fees with irreversible on-chain execution.\n\nOn ASPIS, investors can track the performance and operations of the DAOs they’ve invested in and start or participate in critical decisions of the DAO, such as controlling tools for DAO managers (allowlist wallets they can interact with using DAO capital or putting limits on monthly spendings). Rage quit and safety measures are also included in basic DAO mechanics and will be adopted by all DAOs launched on ASPIS.\n\nInvestors can browse through all DAOs deployed with ASPIS constructor and choose funds and projects they want to join, knowing that all DAOs built on ASPIS are safe and have control over their invested capital.\n\nKEY ASPIS BENEFITS:\n\nFully on-chain governance. All voting happens on-chain, and all results are commissioned on-chain — for example, vote to propose a new transaction or to change contract parameters.\n\nNo coding expertise is needed. You can deploy your investment club or project without the need to develop complex DAO contracts.\n\nCustomized DAO modules. Add functions on the go as you will need them. Make your DAO transition smooth and customized to your own needs.\n\nOne-stop-shop for DAOs. Create your DAO with ASPIS Deployer, Raise funds on ASPIS DAOPad, Vote and manage your assets on ASPIS Dashboard\n\nROADMAP\n\nhttps://candidac.org/uploads/default/optimized/1X/af2ef5e2cddf3f1f7fb5992744853957879631dd_2_1380x770.jpeg\n\nPROJECT LINKS\n\nPitch: Link not found - Rebrandly 2\n\nDemo: Link not found - Rebrandly 5\n\nDemovideo: https://go.aspis.finance/demovideo 1\n\nApplication form for beta testers: go.aspis.finance/apply\n\nMedium: Link not found - Rebrandly 1\n\nInstruction how to create dao: Link not found - Rebrandly",

      "content": "Introduction\nStaFi protocol is the first liquid staking protocol for multiple POS blockchains. StaFi aims to solve the contradiction between Mainnet security and token liquidity in PoS consensus.\n\nUsers can stake PoS tokens through StaFi and receive rTokens in return, which are available for trading, while still earning staking rewards. rToken is a synthetic staking derivative issued by StaFi to users when users stake PoS tokens through StaFi rToken App 2 . rTokens are anchored to the PoS tokens staked by users and the corresponding staking rewards. rTokens can be transferred and traded at any time.\n\nTo date, the platform has released up to 10 various liquid staking solutions including rETH (StaFi Staked ETH), rMATIC, rBNB, rATOM, among others.\n\nWhat is rMETIS and How it Works\nUsers can deposit METIS on the StaFi Protocol without any limitations based on their capacity. The deposited METIS is subsequently staked by StaFi’s staking contract, which autonomously selects the optimal sequencers to generate and maximize staking yields.\n\nUsers who deposit METIS on StaFi will receive an equivalent amount of rMETIS (rToken StaFi equivalent) to the value they staked. rMETIS is an erc20 and rebase token. Subsequently, users can freely trade rMETIS (rToken equivalent) or provide liquidity (LP) to earn additional yield. This additional yield can be staked alongside our reputable DEX partners on METIS.\n\nBenefit\n\nMETIS Ecosystem\n\nIncrease TVL and Grow METIS Liquidity\nNew DeFi Use Case: stable coin and lending based on LST\nImprove the Network Security\n\nMETIS Holder and User\n\nMore Yield\nMore DeFi Use Case\n\nRoadmap and Plan\nSubmit and discuss rMETIS proposal on the StaFi rLaunchpad\nTechnical research\nDiscuss with METIS team\nrMETIS community voting\nDevelopment(Contract, FE, BE)\nLaunch on Testnet\nLaunch on Mainnet\nDeFi Partner\nDeFi Integration\n\nMore\nWebsite: https://stafi.io 3\nrToken App: https://app.stafi.io\nDocument: https://docs.stafi.io\nDeFilama: https://defillama.com/protocol/stafi\nDune: https://dune.com/stafi-analysis/stafi\nGithub: stafiprotocol · GitHub\nAudit: security/audits at main · stafiprotocol/security · GitHub\nrLaunchpad: New rToken on rLaunchpad - StaFi Protocol Governance",

      "content": "Introduction\n\nTria is: One name for all things web3 – a full-stack wallet infrastructure to seamlessly onboard natives and non-natives onto Web3 applications.\n\nProblem\n\nAs a web3 community, we are all very well-versed with the issues we currently face in Web3 user onboarding and convoluted user journeys. Metis network is no exception to that. Two big onboarding issues at hand:\n\nMetamask, Coinbase, and other Web3 wallets are too complex for non-natives\nSocial onboarding primitives such as Web3Auth, Privy, and more onboard users to one dApp at a time, creating isolated economies. (i.e., no/low composability)\nA Gmail account lets you use any Web2 application. Similarly, one metamask lets you connect to any dApp on EVM-compatible chains. But since Metamask is too complex for non-natives – we need another universally portable primitive with an easy-to-understand user journey that helps new users onboard the entire Web3 or entire metis ecosystem at once.\n\nTria\n\nAt Tria 3, we envision onboarding millions of new users onto Metis using DID-based onboarding. We are proud to say we are one of first to do this in web3 industry. Think Gmail, but for Web3. Use @metis names to log in, pay, and transact on any blockchain, dApp, and device – without ever downloading a client-side wallet – all powered by Tria’s Layer 0-based infrastructure, Super Layer 2\n\nTria’a SDKs provide a comprehensive set of tools and infrastructure for decentralized applications, enabling a Web2-like, user-friendly experience. Tria’s portable social-login accounts create interconnected economies amongst dApps, to foster stronger user acquisition and partnership opportunities.\n\nProducts\n\nOnboarding SDKs – onboarding both Web3 (EOAs) and Web2 (Socials, Email & Phone)\nUser-focused, multi-chain embedded Wallets\nTria user-facing web application\niOS and Android application\nA stealth, LLAM (large language and action models) powered crypto chatbot.\nTria is currently in stealth and raised its first pre-seed round in Q2 2023 from a total of 16 tier-one investors, angels, and advisors.\n\nTraction to date\n\nNative naming service for a couple of top 20 CMC L1s (going live in Q2-Q3)\nL1 and L2 Blockchains: Native onboarding solution to an L2 (announcing soon). In-talks along similar lines with 4 more (EVM, Polkadot, Cosmos, and Bitcoin ecosystem).\nDapps: 5+ mid-sized early customers have integrated Tria. 15+ in pipeline.\nEnterprise Customers: In late-stage discussions with entities in the United Nations to implement Tria’s DIDs in humanitarian aid.\nEcosystems: Closely working with major ecosystems on DIDs, Onboarding, UX and Infrastructure. (to name a few – Polygon, Binance, Manta, Berachain, Fuse)\nProduct Journey\n\nQ2-3 2023\n\nFundraise complete\nSuper Layer V1 development\nMulti-chain wallet development across all major platforms (iOS, Android, Web and Extension)\nAlpha Launch: IRL beta launch in Bali’s biggest co-working places\nQ3-Q3 2023\n\nSuper Layer V2 to facilitate cross-chain wallets and foster interconnected economies\nB2B SDKs development\nSocial onboarding (EOAs, Socials, Emails, and Mobile)\nHighly-customizable embedded wallet\nAA-activation and test net on major EVMs.\nQ4\n\nBackend Infra Upgrade to MPC-TSS (for enhanced security and decentralization)\nProduct UI/UX upgrades\nDevelopment of LLAMs and early SDK launches\n2024 Product Roadmap\n\nQ1’2024\n\nRevamping the entire Frontend to a new look\nAudits of SL and DID Contracts (Undergoing)\nExtend SDK support on native mobile frameworks and Unity\nWebApp controlled beta launch (with quests with partner dapps and ecosystem)\nMobile App controlled beta launch\nLLAMs controlled beta launch (Whatsapp and iMessage)\nQ2’2024 - Q4’2024\n\nFull-scale, public launch of all products\nAirdrop season (Standalone and also with partner dapps and ecosystems)\nSLV3 (Secret)\nTech\n\nSuper Layer (SL) is a symphony of Web3 excellence – intersecting client-side primitives, peer-to-peer omni-chain communication, decentralized enclaves and ephemeral computation units – all purposed toward enabling a rich and wallet-less, composable Web3 UX.\n\nLearn more at Super Layer 2\n\nOver last 9 months our focus was buildinga solid backend and over the course of the next 3 months, our primary focus is revamping and re-designing the entire front end (UI/UX).\n\nLinks\n\nDemo Dapp: https://demo-tria.vercel.app/ 7 (WIP)\nCustomer Integration: https://www.empireofsight.com/ 3\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/useTria 4\nLinkedin: https://www.linkedin.com/company/usetria\nWebsite: https://www.tria.so 3",

      "content": "Alphaday’s Utility\n\nCrypto has exploded in popularity over the last 4-5 years and there is so much going on that it’s almost impossible to keep up with everything. Our user research showed that users are overwhelmed with information and spend a lot of time jumping from one news source to another, from one social site to another, and usually have dozens of tabs open to stay up to date with everything happening in a community.\n\nAlphaday builds crypto experience dashboards for enthusiasts, developers, and projects. Users can drag and drop from hundreds of services, news and social feeds, charts, and dapp functionality to create their daily workflows inside a single dashboard. This eliminates the need to have multiple browser tabs open to get different bits of information. i.e. imagine having token prices, gas prices, twitter feed, latest news headlines, TVL, and any other information any user could possibly want all within one single dashboard.\n\nUniqueness\n\nAccording to our conducted market research on users, currently people’s regular crypto workflows consist of jumping from one browser tab to another to check prices, read news, follow twitter, participate in discussions. A typical crypto user will have 6 to 10 open tabs at any given time and people have referred to Alphaday as the ‘tab killer’ because all the information you’d need across all your different tabs is available in Alphaday. In this sense, we do not have any direct competitor that can provide 50 different types of services and functionality within one dashboard.\n\nSecurity\n\nAlphaday does not (currently) have any smart contracts deployed. However, before a newly built widget or feature is deployed for users, there are procedures we follow regarding thorough testing practices. If anything may potentially break user experience in any way, we do our best to spot it before it goes live and fix it.\n\nWhat we want to build for you\n\nWe would like to create a Metis ecosystem dashboard that aggregates the following information into a single community dashboard:\n\nThe latest Metis official announcements and blog post content.\n\nA feed of all news mentions of Metis from coindesk, cointelegraph and 20+ other news sources aggregated from across the internet.\n\nA calendar containing all Metis events including Metis Governance votes, meetups, hackathons with Metis bounties, AMAs.\n\nPodcast feed containing the latest appearances and interviews given by Metis team members.\n\nYoutube stream containing educational Metis content.\n\nMetis Document directory.\n\nMETIS token current market price.\n\nIntegration with Metis Forum to show the latest and trending discussion topics.\n\nTwitter, Discord, & Telegram Integration to show a feed of latest discussions.\n\nFAQ, tech and org whitepapers, METIS tokenomics information.\n\nMetis Careers integration to show the latest open jobs listed on Metis.\n\nMetis and Metis ecosystem TVL data (through Defillama integration).\n\nDeveloper and user tools, links, and descriptions for navigation and engagement within the Metis Ecosystem.\n\nMetis metrics including TVL, number of trades and other metrics pulled in from Dune Analytics\n\nA widget featuring the Metis roadmap with all the descriptions and links included.\n\nDeveloper and user tools, links, and descriptions for navigation and engagement within the Metis Ecosystem, including the platform.\n\nMetis user-growth, trading data and other metrics pulled in from Dune Analytics.\n\nWe should be able to build and deploy the above dashboard within 2 months so if this grant is approved we want to launch the Metis dashboard by August 2023.\n\nThereafter, we will maintain & curate the dashboard on a daily basis throughout a year, as well as improve the functionality and availability of features in our application as a whole.\n\nPlease note that we can add and remove widgets and/or contents as required by the team or community. For a brief idea about other widgets and data that we can include, please visit our Live product page (Beta) at: https://app.alphaday.com/ 8\n\nRoadmap\n\nPhase 1, Q3 2022 (completed):\n\nBeta launch with 32 widgets\nCustomizable board functionality\nMulti-widget global search\nPhase 2, Q4 2022 (completed):\n\nV1 launch\n\nWidget Library\n\nBoard Library\n\nUI/UX Update\n\nVideo & Podcast players\n\nPhase 3, H1 2023:\n\nDApp interactivity\n\nSwap, staking, Lend, Borrow\n\nSubscription model\n\nSocial Layer with Commenting system\n\nFuture Phases, H2 2023:\n\nExpansion to equities, commodities, forex, real estate\nAI-derived research analysis and reports\nAlphaday’s Audit Information\n\nGiven that we do not have any smart contracts deployed on Alphaday, auditing is deemed unnecessary.\n\nVideo Briefing\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThCd_W3rK_8\n\nRelevant Links\nLive Product: https://app.alphaday.com/ \nLanding Page: https://alphaday.com/ \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/AlphadayHQ \nDiscord: Alphaday\nGithub: Alphaday · GitHub",

      "title": "Ecosystem Proposal: MindNetwork.xyz",
      "content": "Summary: \nThis proposal outlines the integration of MindNetwork.xyz’s Zero Trust Layer into the Metis ecosystem to significantly enhance security protocols, ensuring a more robust, trustless environment for transactions and interactions within the network. By leveraging MindNetwork.xyz’s cutting-edge security framework, we aim to fortify the Metis ecosystem against a wide array of cyber threats, as well as to enable users to have clearer and better ownership over their data.\n\nIntroduction: \nMind Network is one of the first tokenized startups to apply the long-awaited ‘Holy Grail of Encryption’ to Web3. Mind Network is a Zero Trust Layer that offers a security and data privacy solution that achieves true CrossFi scale, complying with regulatory requirements while staying true to Web3 principles of asset tokenization and individual data ownership.\n\nMind Network has two components that both leverage FHE to achieve a Zero Trust Layer for the Metis ecosystem. First, it combines Fully Homomorphic Encryption with Stealth Address Protocol (FHE DK-SAP). Second, its Zero Trust Data Lake uses ZK for input/output and FHE for allowing third-party computation upon encrypted data without the need for decryption. These two components enable private and secure value transfers, solving two problems simultaneously:\n\n1.) The need for privacy with Web3 data and\n2.) The security protocol needed for Web2 and traditional finance to enter web3 while remaining compliant with regulators.\n\nCredits:\n1st Place in ETH Singapore Hackathon\nEthereum Fellowship Program & Grant\nBinance Incubation Camp Season 5\nChainlink BUILD Program\nConsensys Startup Program\n\nProposal Details:\n\nObjective: Enhance the Metis ecosystem’s security infrastructure using MindNetwork.xyz’s Zero Trust Layer.\n\nTechnology Overview: Introduction: A Quick Look - Mind Network 1\n\nImplementation Strategy: Integration can be achieved quickly.\n\nBenefits: This Zero Trust Layer for Metis will be beneficial to many DeFi projects as well as to any dapps sharing potentially sensitive user data.\n\nExpected Outcomes: Our testnet achieved ~1M transactions and 400k active wallets in <1 month. We expect strong enthusiasm within the Metis community from this new feature.\n\nContact Information: biz@mindnetwork.xyz\nX: @taoofdata",

It stands out in the DeFi space due to its unique approach to minimizing swap charges and ensuring trades without price impact. This proposal outlines the benefits zkEra Finance can take to further its mission on the Metis network.\n\nZkera Finance was launched in July on wagmi.com on zksync network.\n\nKey Features and Upgrades\n\nHigh-Frequency Trading and Leverage : By offering high-frequency trading and leverage options, zkEra Finance can attract a broader range of traders, catering to both novices and seasoned professionals.\n\nAttractive Yield Opportunities for Liquidity Providers : Leveraging market making, swap charges, and leveraged trading activities, the platform can provide lucrative yield opportunities to liquidity providers.\n\nDiversified Liquidity Pools : The introduction of diversified liquidity pools will enhance risk management and provide a more stable trading environment.\n\nContinuous Protocol Improvement : Taking inspiration from the GMX protocol, zkEra Finance should continuously evolve to adapt to user needs and market trends.\n\nLP position hedging : Giving an option to users for creating short positions against tokens in ZLP pool, whose price decline will respectfully lower the price of ZLP. In that case, with a decrease in the price of ZLP, the user compensates for the loss with the earnings from short positions.\n\nStrategic Initiatives\n\nEnhanced User Experience: Focus on simplifying the user interface to attract a broader user base, emphasizing ease of use without compromising on advanced features.\n\nMarketing and Community Engagement : Increase visibility through strategic marketing campaigns and active community engagement. Collaborations with influencers and participation in DeFi events can be instrumental.\n\nIntegration with Pyth Oracles : Continue to leverage Pyth Oracles for real-time, accurate market data, ensuring the platform’s decisions are informed by the most current and reliable information.\n\nOur stats:\n\nSince our launch in July on zkSync Era, we had continuous growth in our user base. We believe we can capitalise on Metis network even better.\n\n \n![image](ipfs://bafybeighfetwfriozltdjyvvyhvxlhcett7mgvjx5qecrpcdwsboufq5na)\n    \nSince the launch, our volumes and open interest keeps growing.\n\n \n![image](ipfs://bafybeib2thyijilxjjaaclhrwjznhxx5vnrjxvc4el4mmqldgw5wv7g6ue)\n    \n\nRoadmap:\n\nDeployment of zkera.fi 2 on Metis within 20 days given the proposal passes.\nLaunch of Utility NFT’s - within 45 days given the proposal passes.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn conclusion, zkEra Finance is excited to expand its journey on the Metis network, drawing inspiration from numerous innovative projects in the space, like Wagmi. This expansion aligns with our commitment to embracing new opportunities and collaborations within the DeFi ecosystem, furthering our mission to revolutionize decentralized finance. We look forward to contributing to and thriving in this growing network.\n\nOfficial Links\n\nWebsite : https://www.zkera.fi 3\n\nX https://twitter.com/zkerafi 1\n\nDiscord zkEra.fi\n\nDocs https://zkera.gitbook.io/",

      "title": "Ecosystem Proposal: deBridge IaaS",
      "content": "Introduction\n\nWe’re building deBridge and DLN. deBridge is a secure cross-chain infrastructure for high-performance interoperability. By removing the bottlenecks and risks of liquidity pools, deBridge enables DeFi applications to scale faster with ultra capital-efficient and deep liquidity transfers across chains.\n\nDLN is a high-performance cross-chain trading infrastructure built on top of deBridge. DLN pioneered cross-chain intents and 0-TVL design enabling the fastest cross-chain trading of any assets with zero slippage, and without liquidity at risk (0 TVL).\n\n\n \n![image](ipfs://bafybeibfja7sbutj3glb2vvg237fr4ymsweg65x3ixmlkooh3nlxzcti7i)\n    \nAbout deBridge IaaS\n\ndeBridge IaaS (Interoperability-as-a-Service) is a turnkey solution for both EVM and SVM blockchain ecosystems, permissionless and permissioned, solving all three pillars of interoperability simultaneously including transfers of authenticated messages, cross-chain asset custody, and native high-performance value exchange.\n\nFeatures and opportunities include:\n\ndeBridge Messaging\nDLN Cross-Chain Exchange\ndePort Asset Custody\nWe’re excited to bring these deBridge IaaS features and possibilities to the Metis ecosystem and enable bidirectional interoperability between Metis and all other chains supported by deBridge, facilitating onboarding of liquidity and users for Dapps built on Metis.\n\nUnique Value Proposition for Metis\n\nBridging solutions under the classical AMM model poses a lot of risks and bottlenecks, especially when it comes to cross-chain capabilities and scaling DeFi as a whole, and we offer a great alternative with notable USPs:\n\n1. Capital Efficiency\nSince DLN is not under the classical AMM model, traders incur zero slippage on any order size. Instead, there’s just an 8bps spread (at a market quote). Additionally, the quote shown on the destination chain is a guaranteed rate because there’s no slippage incurred. In contrast, solutions under the AMM model can only show the theoretical maximum that a user can receive, which disregards the slippage tolerance and the amount a user receives on the destination, which tends to be much less than the metric shown. We believe this is an inefficient model and user experience.\n\nThis capital efficiency also opens up the opportunity for Metis to enable efficient liquidity incentivisation, where the cost of bridging into Metis can be reduced to zero cost as users can be rebated the cost. We’re currently doing this for the Optimism ecosystem with the 100K OP grant we received, more information can be found here: OP Horizon is now live! \n\n2. Fast settlement\nWith our unique, high-performance intent-based approach, we also enable lightning-fast settlement time, with most of our trades being settled within 20 seconds. This is a massive improvement in cross-chain UX, as users now don’t have to wait 5 to 15 minutes for their assets to get bridged.\nAnalytics on DLN’s settlement time: https://twitter.com/AlexSmirnov__/status/1658137477222133762\nDemo video of a DLN trade: https://twitter.com/AlexSmirnov__/status/1649478527522144256\n\n3. Security\nHaving a 0 TVL model is also a very favorable model from a security perspective, as the risk is not being borne on passively locked multi-million dollar liquidity pools. This means that the attack surface layer of our model is highly minimized.\nOver time, the DeFi space has witnessed the security risks associated with the TVL model, as they are honeypots at risk of getting drained.\n\n4. High–performance cross-chain interactions\nDLN infrastructure allows attaching any call data/instruction to the trade, which the market maker will be obliged to execute at the moment of fulfillment. That opens a whole new spectrum of applications and enables projects to build powerful UX which abstracts away the entire infrastructure stack. For instance, users can initiate a $1,000 cross-chain trade into Metis and have a long perp position opened at the moment of settlement, having this interaction executed in seconds.\n\n5. Scalability\nDLN is a much more favorable solution as it’s more rapidly scalable. It’s able to finally facilitate over 7-8 figure orders simply because the model is not capped to the size of a liquidity pool. If there is a significant volume in a certain direction, private market makers will be able to efficiently fulfill that demand as they can re-balance liquidity very quickly, which is not feasible in classical bridges with statically locked liquidity.\n\nLiquidity in DLN is also much more capital efficient as takers (e.g. private market makers) have full custody of their liquidity in DLN. This enables a vast range of rebalancing capabilities where liquidity can be reapplied to order settlements to maximize yield opportunities.\nExample of a $1 million USDC trade from Polygon to BSC (only an 8bps spread):\n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreidgzs56fsyeu2egewmq7ktrkg2erjus5gi5u33yi3sh4r44fzm7j4)\n    \nResources:\n\nApp: https://app.dln.trade/\nWebsite: https://dln.trade/ and https://debridge.finance/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/DLN_Trade and https://twitter.com/deBridgeFinance\nDiscord/Discourse/Community: deBridge\nGithub: deBridge.Finance · GitHub\nSecurity Audits – 26 to date: GitHub - debridge-finance/debridge-security: deBridge security audits\nTechnical/Economic Documentation: https://docs.dln.trade/ and https://docs.debridge.finance/",

      "content": "![image](ipfs://bafybeiec2phxwvmpew3y3rdzo2gevr2k3tt5nsbuwyn4ijwxi7epxnljtu)\n\nBasic Information\nOmniBTC is the ultimate cross-chain swap and lending platform that unifies all on-chain liquidity using interoperability protocols such as LayerZero, Wormhole, and Celer Network, etc, and allowing users to swap and lend any token on any chain without interacting with multiple protocols, DEX, and bridges.\n\nWe offer a few key features and benefits:\n\n-OmniSwap(Cross-chain Swap): Users can swap Token A in Chain A for any other assets on Optimism with one click. We realize the cross-chain swap by integrating with multi-interoperability protocols.\n\n-OmniLending(Cross-chain Lending): Users can easily deposit any chain’s token into our pools and borrow other assets on any chain. We got 10M TVL just after serval months of release.\n\nBesides, OmniBTC was granted by Sui Foundation, Optimism Foundation, Web3 Foundation, and DoraHacks.\n\nData Overview\n1. Product Usage\n1.1 Basic Data\nData as 3rd, Jan\n\nOmniSwap:\n\n-Total Trading Volume: 168M+\n\n-Total Transactions: 1.1M+\n\n-Monthly Trading Volume: $15M+\n\n-Monthly Trading Transactions: 65K+\n\n-Total unique addresses that interact with Protocol: 333,920\n\nOmniLending:\n\n-TVL: $19M\n\n-Total Supply:$12.5M\n\n-Total Borrow: $6.6M\n\n1.2 TOP Transactions\nOur hottest trending pair is Optimism, Arbitrum, BEVM(BTC Layer 2). We integrated BEVM this middle Nov and soon accomplished a $10M transaction volume with just one BEVM chain.\n \n![image](ipfs://bafybeidfnjcffawe3ata6rfu2vrbib3axaadwupdckiarxf4cwrzavsjde)\n    \n2. Social Media\n-Twitter Follower:88.6K\n\n-Discord Member:21K\n\n-Medium Subscriber:1.1K\n\nHow do Metis and OmniBTC integration benefit each other?\n\nImprove Ecosystem Activeness: OmniBTC will bring Metis to more exposures like our community. Incentive them to bridge to Metis and activate the whole ecosystem. Also as the platform, users who need to engage Metis will benefit us to take their Defi needs. Moreover, we support 18+ hottest chains like BTC Layer 2 BEVM, Solana, Starknet…After supporting Metis, we’ll expand the bridge space for users to better shuttle with different ecosystems, and bring more interactions to Metis.\n\nMarketing Cooperation Exposure: Though it’s not as important as ecosystem flourishing, marketing, and exposure also make something. Helping each other to bring things to more users and cooperating to launch more interesting incentive campaigns can also grow the community.\n\nCommunity Expansion: There’s no doubt Metis is on a fast expansion and development, we’d love to be one of it and partner with other projects to build Metis together.\n\nBasic Info\nWebsite: https://www.omnibtc.finance/ 1\nOmniSwap:https://app.omnibtc.finance/swap\nOmniLending: OmniBTC\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/OmniBTC\nGithub: OmniBTC · GitHub\nGitbook:https://omnibtclabs.gitbook.io/omnibtc/\nMedium:OmniBTC – Medium\nDiscord:OmniBTC",

      "title": "Ecosystem Proposal: AirLyft",
      "content": "Introduction\nAirLyft is a decentralised growth, loyalty, and onboarding platform for projects to establish, expand, and engage their community. It is a feature-rich platform to incentivise on-chain/off-chain actions hosted by the projects for the community. AirLyft automates the validation, reward creation, and distribution, thereby saving hours of marketing & development effort.\n\nValue Proposition\nFor the value proposition on why we want to build on the Metis Ecosystem, firstly we are here not just to help grow Metis as a community but AirLyft caters to the entire Metis Ecosystem which means that with this integration, any dApps building on Metis (DeFi, GameFi, Metaverse, NFT, or any category) can also avail and leverage this integration for their growth purpose. We aim to introduce a better way to decentralized growth, loyalty, onboarding, and community engagement in the Metis Ecosystem. Being a multichain platform, we also help users and Web 3 projects on different blockchains onboard onto Metis and participate actively in the ecosystem. Hence AirLyft acts like a gateway for projects and blockchain lovers to be part of your awesome ecosystem by creating a perfect onboarding flow for projects.\n\nUniqueness Factor\nAirLyft has a unique reward locking mechanism that enables projects to use their existing tokens/NFTs as rewards by locking them safely on-chain. For locked tokens, users have a guarantee that they will receive the reward if they win, and projects don’t have to worry about distribution.\n\nAirLyft is the sole growth platform that allows users to create their own fungible and non-fungible tokens and distribute them as rewards. These can be used as on-chain proof of participation which opens up several opportunities for the project to incentivise its community.\n\nAirLyft interacts with smart contracts for validating user activity. Organizations can simply create learn-to-earn campaigns at AirLyft & can reward users based on the activities they perform at the organization’s dApp. For example, a Uniswap-kind DEX can ask users to stake, add liquidity or swap certain tokens, add these as tasks of a contest, and AirLyft verifies all actions on-chain.\n\nIn total, the platform supports more than 35 different tasks that projects can ask users to do. Including Twitter, Telegram, Discord, REST APIs, Blockchain explorers, and integrations with indexers through GraphQL.\n\nAirLyft has an exposable API & webhooks that projects can leverage for custom features. For example, launchpads can use our webhooks to whitelist users for performing some social actions.\n\nAirLyft is the only platform in the market that allows projects to verify actions on multiple blockchains in a single campaign.\n\nThe platform also supports multiple reward amounts, types as well as different distribution strategies, in a single campaign. For example, a project can give 0.1 ETH to the top 5 winners, 10 USDC to the next 10, and a participation NFT to a random 100.\n\nBenefits for Users\nLet’s take a look in-depth at the problem first. In the present blockchain industry, companies are excellent at creating products, but when it comes to marketing and expanding their community, these products fail to obtain the necessary momentum, which causes the growth curve to eventually flatten out significantly. The following are some of the issues:\n\nBots or multiple accounts are used by a few users to gain an unfair advantage in contests, which demotivates the real community members from participation.\n\nProduct Adoption is very low which is only 2% of the conversion. It takes hours to design & develop a contest that will captivate participants and teach them about the project at the same time i.e. Learn To Earn campaigns.\n\nValidating user’s actions on the blockchain, and connecting them with actions on other social media channels is a laborious task.\n\nCollecting the wallet addresses of winners & distributing rewards is a cumbersome activity which takes almost 80% of the marketing and community team effort.\n\nOnce users win a reward, they usually swap the same with other assets as they are unaware of the token applications.\n\nWeb3 users are scattered across blockchain/ecosystem silos & it is difficult for projects to attract and onboard users active on different chains.\n\nAnd many more… AirLyft comprehensively addresses the challenges associated with campaign management by offering a unified platform equipped with a robust user interface. This platform enables seamless creation, release, and tracking processes, alleviating concerns related to the aforementioned issues. Our objective is to streamline your entire campaign workflow, allowing you to focus solely on result analysis. By automating tasks such as verification, validation, distribution, and adoption, AirLyft aims to optimize efficiency and save up to 90% of your marketing and community team’s time. Furthermore, a significant value proposition for users lies in the enhanced product adoption facilitated by our platform. This ensures that activities extend beyond the social aspect of the platform to encompass blockchain integration, providing a comprehensive and impactful solution\n\nRoadmap\nWe have defined a set roadmap for AirLyft on the Metis Ecosystem which includes the development and integration of AirLyft on the blockchain.\n\nMilestone 1:\n\nDeliverables Summary: Integration of Metis into “Ecosystems” and development of the ability to read on-chain data on Metis Chain, with wallet connection capability.\n\nDeliverables:\n\nIntegrate Metis into the supported Ecosystems list that allows projects to select Metis as their ecosystem and participants to filter Metis projects directly.\n\nDevelop the ability to create quests based on Metis Smart Contracts by putting conditions on smart contract read functions directly from AirLyft.\n\nAllow projects to create quests that support actions like “Hold X amount of Tokens” and assign points (Fuel & XP) to users.\n\nIntegrate the wallet in AirLyft so that users can sign a message and verify ownership, these wallet addresses will be used for verifying on chain quests.\n\nAllow users to trade Fuel for various off-chain Rewards like coupons, vouchers or whitelists.\n\nExtend the whitelist feature to support the Metis Network addresses for whitelisting and allow projects to configure campaigns with preconditions such as the owner of a certain wallet, email etc.\n\nDevelopment of certificate authority module to issue certificates on-chain to users for participation to prevent bot check mechanism.\n\nMilestone 2:\n\nDeliverables Summary: Development and deployment of “Air Token” Rust contracts on the Metis network, allowing projects to create and distribute NFTs over Metis.\n\nDeliverables:\n\nDevelop an “Air Token Controller” smart contract and associated UI on AirLyft to enable the creation of tokens as proof of participation and attendance NFTs directly on the Metis Network.\n\nDevelop distribution features in the contract of on-chain NFT distribution based on the distribution strategies.\n\nDevelop functionality for Metis projects to upload the custom token base URI or use our default base URI for their proof of participation.\n\nExtend the claim feature to support Metis Network’s digital assets.\n\nAllow the claiming of proof of participation NFTs by the participants on AirLyft.\n\nMilestone 3:\n\nDeliverables Summary: Develop & deploy “Air Pool” smart contracts. These enable projects to lock tokens & digital assets to use in their giveaways.\n\nDeliverables:\n\nDevelop and deploy ‘Air Pool’ smart contracts for Metis Network assets. With this, projects can create reward pools, lock their tokens, and utilize this reward pool to execute on-chain reward distribution of these assets directly on the Metis Network.\n\nExtend support for the reusability of these reward pools. This would help projects lock Metis Network assets once in a reward pool and reuse portions of the pool across multiple campaigns.\n\nExtend refund support of leftover rewards directly to the source wallet by signing a transaction on the Metis Network. In case there are rewards in a pool which were not utilized for a campaign, projects would have the ability to withdraw these assets using the source wallet.\n\nCreate support for Metis tokens which would include their reward locking, distribution, refund and all related activities.\n\nDevelop a feature for the creation of multiple reward distributions in the same event. For instance, projects can giveaway multiple tokens including NFTs in the same giveaway campaign.\n\nREST and Block Explorer API Integration support for the Metis Network for projects to create further engaging campaigns.\n\nProvide support for the in-house indexing protocols supported by Metis to create engaging on-chain actions.\n\nProvide Leaderboard and SHOP functionalities to redeem rewards in the form of merchandise, coupons, secret codes, tokens, and many more.\n\nSummary\nAligned with Metis’ overarching theme, “A BLOCKCHAIN FOR EVERYONE,” AirLyft is dedicated to providing an inclusive platform for all. In collaboration with Metis, we share a common goal of expediting the transition to Web3, fostering a world that is both accessible and decentralized. Our commitment extends to introducing the concept of enhanced product adoption through versatile integrations. Recognizing the importance of comprehensive support for the entire blockchain community, we have developed a product with a multi-support foundation. This approach ensures utility for all Dapps, whether in the realms of DeFi or GameFi, irrespective of their ecosystem. We firmly endorse the belief that seeking support should not only benefit the foundation but also contribute to the growth of Dapps across the blockchain.\n\nTeam:\nWe are a team of 6 people, with a combined experience of over 70 years! 5 are working full time & 1 part-time.\n\nOfficial Links:\nWebsite: https://www.airlyft.one\nDocs: https://docs.airlyft.one/\nAudits: Kyte.One audits by Hacken\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/airlyftone",

      "content": "![image](ipfs://bafybeiec2phxwvmpew3y3rdzo2gevr2k3tt5nsbuwyn4ijwxi7epxnljtu)\n\nBasic Information\nOmniBTC is the ultimate cross-chain swap and lending platform that unifies all on-chain liquidity using interoperability protocols such as LayerZero, Wormhole, and Celer Network, etc, and allowing users to swap and lend any token on any chain without interacting with multiple protocols, DEX, and bridges.\n\nWe offer a few key features and benefits:\n\n-OmniSwap(Cross-chain Swap): Users can swap Token A in Chain A for any other assets on Optimism with one click. We realize the cross-chain swap by integrating with multi-interoperability protocols.\n\n-OmniLending(Cross-chain Lending): Users can easily deposit any chain’s token into our pools and borrow other assets on any chain. We got 10M TVL just after serval months of release.\n\nBesides, OmniBTC was granted by Sui Foundation, Optimism Foundation, Web3 Foundation, and DoraHacks.\n\nData Overview\n1. Product Usage\n1.1 Basic Data\nData as 3rd, Jan\n\nOmniSwap:\n\n-Total Trading Volume: 168M+\n\n-Total Transactions: 1.1M+\n\n-Monthly Trading Volume: $15M+\n\n-Monthly Trading Transactions: 65K+\n\n-Total unique addresses that interact with Protocol: 333,920\n\nOmniLending:\n\n-TVL: $19M\n\n-Total Supply:$12.5M\n\n-Total Borrow: $6.6M\n\n1.2 TOP Transactions\nOur hottest trending pair is Optimism, Arbitrum, BEVM(BTC Layer 2). We integrated BEVM this middle Nov and soon accomplished a $10M transaction volume with just one BEVM chain.\n \n![image](ipfs://bafybeidfnjcffawe3ata6rfu2vrbib3axaadwupdckiarxf4cwrzavsjde)\n    \n2. Social Media\n-Twitter Follower:88.6K\n\n-Discord Member:21K\n\n-Medium Subscriber:1.1K\n\nHow do Metis and OmniBTC integration benefit each other?\n\nImprove Ecosystem Activeness: OmniBTC will bring Metis to more exposures like our community. Incentive them to bridge to Metis and activate the whole ecosystem. Also as the platform, users who need to engage Metis will benefit us to take their Defi needs. Moreover, we support 18+ hottest chains like BTC Layer 2 BEVM, Solana, Starknet…After supporting Metis, we’ll expand the bridge space for users to better shuttle with different ecosystems, and bring more interactions to Metis.\n\nMarketing Cooperation Exposure: Though it’s not as important as ecosystem flourishing, marketing, and exposure also make something. Helping each other to bring things to more users and cooperating to launch more interesting incentive campaigns can also grow the community.\n\nCommunity Expansion: There’s no doubt Metis is on a fast expansion and development, we’d love to be one of it and partner with other projects to build Metis together.\n\nBasic Info\nWebsite: https://www.omnibtc.finance/ 1\nOmniSwap:https://app.omnibtc.finance/swap\nOmniLending: OmniBTC\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/OmniBTC\nGithub: OmniBTC · GitHub\nGitbook:https://omnibtclabs.gitbook.io/omnibtc/\nMedium:OmniBTC – Medium\nDiscord:OmniBTC",

      "title": "Ecosystem Proposal: deBridge IaaS",
      "content": "Introduction\n\nWe’re building deBridge and DLN. deBridge is a secure cross-chain infrastructure for high-performance interoperability. By removing the bottlenecks and risks of liquidity pools, deBridge enables DeFi applications to scale faster with ultra capital-efficient and deep liquidity transfers across chains.\n\nDLN is a high-performance cross-chain trading infrastructure built on top of deBridge. DLN pioneered cross-chain intents and 0-TVL design enabling the fastest cross-chain trading of any assets with zero slippage, and without liquidity at risk (0 TVL).\n\n\n \n![image](ipfs://bafybeibfja7sbutj3glb2vvg237fr4ymsweg65x3ixmlkooh3nlxzcti7i)\n    \nAbout deBridge IaaS\n\ndeBridge IaaS (Interoperability-as-a-Service) is a turnkey solution for both EVM and SVM blockchain ecosystems, permissionless and permissioned, solving all three pillars of interoperability simultaneously including transfers of authenticated messages, cross-chain asset custody, and native high-performance value exchange.\n\nFeatures and opportunities include:\n\ndeBridge Messaging\nDLN Cross-Chain Exchange\ndePort Asset Custody\nWe’re excited to bring these deBridge IaaS features and possibilities to the Metis ecosystem and enable bidirectional interoperability between Metis and all other chains supported by deBridge, facilitating onboarding of liquidity and users for Dapps built on Metis.\n\nUnique Value Proposition for Metis\n\nBridging solutions under the classical AMM model poses a lot of risks and bottlenecks, especially when it comes to cross-chain capabilities and scaling DeFi as a whole, and we offer a great alternative with notable USPs:\n\n1. Capital Efficiency\nSince DLN is not under the classical AMM model, traders incur zero slippage on any order size. Instead, there’s just an 8bps spread (at a market quote). Additionally, the quote shown on the destination chain is a guaranteed rate because there’s no slippage incurred. In contrast, solutions under the AMM model can only show the theoretical maximum that a user can receive, which disregards the slippage tolerance and the amount a user receives on the destination, which tends to be much less than the metric shown. We believe this is an inefficient model and user experience.\n\nThis capital efficiency also opens up the opportunity for Metis to enable efficient liquidity incentivisation, where the cost of bridging into Metis can be reduced to zero cost as users can be rebated the cost. We’re currently doing this for the Optimism ecosystem with the 100K OP grant we received, more information can be found here: OP Horizon is now live! \n\n2. Fast settlement\nWith our unique, high-performance intent-based approach, we also enable lightning-fast settlement time, with most of our trades being settled within 20 seconds. This is a massive improvement in cross-chain UX, as users now don’t have to wait 5 to 15 minutes for their assets to get bridged.\nAnalytics on DLN’s settlement time: https://twitter.com/AlexSmirnov__/status/1658137477222133762\nDemo video of a DLN trade: https://twitter.com/AlexSmirnov__/status/1649478527522144256\n\n3. Security\nHaving a 0 TVL model is also a very favorable model from a security perspective, as the risk is not being borne on passively locked multi-million dollar liquidity pools. This means that the attack surface layer of our model is highly minimized.\nOver time, the DeFi space has witnessed the security risks associated with the TVL model, as they are honeypots at risk of getting drained.\n\n4. High–performance cross-chain interactions\nDLN infrastructure allows attaching any call data/instruction to the trade, which the market maker will be obliged to execute at the moment of fulfillment. That opens a whole new spectrum of applications and enables projects to build powerful UX which abstracts away the entire infrastructure stack. For instance, users can initiate a $1,000 cross-chain trade into Metis and have a long perp position opened at the moment of settlement, having this interaction executed in seconds.\n\n5. Scalability\nDLN is a much more favorable solution as it’s more rapidly scalable. It’s able to finally facilitate over 7-8 figure orders simply because the model is not capped to the size of a liquidity pool. If there is a significant volume in a certain direction, private market makers will be able to efficiently fulfill that demand as they can re-balance liquidity very quickly, which is not feasible in classical bridges with statically locked liquidity.\n\nLiquidity in DLN is also much more capital efficient as takers (e.g. private market makers) have full custody of their liquidity in DLN. This enables a vast range of rebalancing capabilities where liquidity can be reapplied to order settlements to maximize yield opportunities.\nExample of a $1 million USDC trade from Polygon to BSC (only an 8bps spread):\n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreidgzs56fsyeu2egewmq7ktrkg2erjus5gi5u33yi3sh4r44fzm7j4)\n    \nResources:\n\nApp: https://app.dln.trade/\nWebsite: https://dln.trade/ and https://debridge.finance/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/DLN_Trade and https://twitter.com/deBridgeFinance\nDiscord/Discourse/Community: deBridge\nGithub: deBridge.Finance · GitHub\nSecurity Audits – 26 to date: GitHub - debridge-finance/debridge-security: deBridge security audits\nTechnical/Economic Documentation: https://docs.dln.trade/ and https://docs.debridge.finance/",

      "title": "Metis CEG Program: Metis Data Aggregator Dashboard on Alphaday",
      "content": "Alphaday’s Utility\n\nCrypto has exploded in popularity over the last 4-5 years and there is so much going on that it’s almost impossible to keep up with everything. Our user research showed that users are overwhelmed with information and spend a lot of time jumping from one news source to another, from one social site to another, and usually have dozens of tabs open to stay up to date with everything happening in a community.\n\nAlphaday builds crypto experience dashboards for enthusiasts, developers, and projects. Users can drag and drop from hundreds of services, news and social feeds, charts, and dapp functionality to create their daily workflows inside a single dashboard. This eliminates the need to have multiple browser tabs open to get different bits of information. i.e. imagine having token prices, gas prices, twitter feed, latest news headlines, TVL, and any other information any user could possibly want all within one single dashboard.\n\nUniqueness\n\nAccording to our conducted market research on users, currently people’s regular crypto workflows consist of jumping from one browser tab to another to check prices, read news, follow twitter, participate in discussions. A typical crypto user will have 6 to 10 open tabs at any given time and people have referred to Alphaday as the ‘tab killer’ because all the information you’d need across all your different tabs is available in Alphaday. In this sense, we do not have any direct competitor that can provide 50 different types of services and functionality within one dashboard.\n\nSecurity\n\nAlphaday does not (currently) have any smart contracts deployed. However, before a newly built widget or feature is deployed for users, there are procedures we follow regarding thorough testing practices. If anything may potentially break user experience in any way, we do our best to spot it before it goes live and fix it.\n\nWhat we want to build for you\n\nWe would like to create a Metis ecosystem dashboard that aggregates the following information into a single community dashboard:\n\nThe latest Metis official announcements and blog post content.\n\nA feed of all news mentions of Metis from coindesk, cointelegraph and 20+ other news sources aggregated from across the internet.\n\nA calendar containing all Metis events including Metis Governance votes, meetups, hackathons with Metis bounties, AMAs.\n\nPodcast feed containing the latest appearances and interviews given by Metis team members.\n\nYoutube stream containing educational Metis content.\n\nMetis Document directory.\n\nMETIS token current market price.\n\nIntegration with Metis Forum to show the latest and trending discussion topics.\n\nTwitter, Discord, & Telegram Integration to show a feed of latest discussions.\n\nFAQ, tech and org whitepapers, METIS tokenomics information.\n\nMetis Careers integration to show the latest open jobs listed on Metis.\n\nMetis and Metis ecosystem TVL data (through Defillama integration).\n\nDeveloper and user tools, links, and descriptions for navigation and engagement within the Metis Ecosystem.\n\nMetis metrics including TVL, number of trades and other metrics pulled in from Dune Analytics\n\nA widget featuring the Metis roadmap with all the descriptions and links included.\n\nDeveloper and user tools, links, and descriptions for navigation and engagement within the Metis Ecosystem, including the platform.\n\nMetis user-growth, trading data and other metrics pulled in from Dune Analytics.\n\nWe should be able to build and deploy the above dashboard within 2 months so if this grant is approved we want to launch the Metis dashboard by August 2023.\n\nThereafter, we will maintain & curate the dashboard on a daily basis throughout a year, as well as improve the functionality and availability of features in our application as a whole.\n\nPlease note that we can add and remove widgets and/or contents as required by the team or community. For a brief idea about other widgets and data that we can include, please visit our Live product page (Beta) at: https://app.alphaday.com/ 4\n\nRoadmap\n\nPhase 1, Q3 2022 (completed):\n\nBeta launch with 32 widgets\nCustomizable board functionality\nMulti-widget global search\nPhase 2, Q4 2022 (completed):\n\nV1 launch\n\nWidget Library\n\nBoard Library\n\nUI/UX Update\n\nVideo & Podcast players\n\nPhase 3, H1 2023:\n\nDApp interactivity\n\nSwap, staking, Lend, Borrow\n\nSubscription model\n\nSocial Layer with Commenting system\n\nFuture Phases, H2 2023:\n\nExpansion to equities, commodities, forex, real estate\nAI-derived research analysis and reports\nAlphaday’s Audit Information\n\nGiven that we do not have any smart contracts deployed on Alphaday, auditing is deemed unnecessary.\n\nRelevant Links\nLive Product: https://app.alphaday.com/ 4\n\nLanding Page: https://alphaday.com/ 2\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/AlphadayHQ 1\n\nDiscord: https://discord.com/invite/8KSmPyT5k8\n\nGithub: Alphaday · https://github.com/AlphadayHQ",

      "title": "Metis CEG Program: Tria - Onboard millions onto Metis with Web2-like UX",
      "content": "**Introduction**\n\nTria is: One name for all things web3 – a full-stack wallet infrastructure to seamlessly onboard natives and non-natives onto Web3 applications.\n\n**Problem**\n\nAs a web3 community, we are all very well-versed with the issues we currently face in Web3 user onboarding and convoluted user journeys. Metis network is no exception to that. Two big onboarding issues at hand:\n\n* Metamask, Coinbase, and other Web3 wallets are too complex for non-natives\n* Social onboarding primitives such as Web3Auth, Privy, and more onboard users to one dApp at a time, creating isolated economies. (i.e., no/low composability)\n\nA Gmail account lets you use any Web2 application. Similarly, one metamask lets you connect to any dApp on EVM-compatible chains. But since Metamask is too complex for non-natives – we need another universally portable primitive with an easy-to-understand user journey that helps new users onboard the entire Web3 or entire metis ecosystem at once.\n\n**Tria**\n\nAt [Tria](https://www.tria.so/), we envision onboarding millions of new users onto Metis using DID-based onboarding. We are proud to say we are one of first to do this in web3 industry. Think Gmail, but for Web3. Use @metis names to log in, pay, and transact on any blockchain, dApp, and device – without ever downloading a client-side wallet – all powered by Tria’s Layer 0-based infrastructure, [Super Layer](https://tria.so/sl)\n\nTria’a SDKs provide a comprehensive set of tools and infrastructure for decentralized applications, enabling a Web2-like, user-friendly experience. Tria’s portable social-login accounts create interconnected economies amongst dApps, to foster stronger user acquisition and partnership opportunities.\n\n**Products**\n\n1. Onboarding SDKs – onboarding both Web3 (EOAs) and Web2 (Socials, Email & Phone)\n2. User-focused, multi-chain embedded Wallets\n3. Tria user-facing web application\n4. iOS and Android application\n5. A stealth, LLAM (large language and action models) powered crypto chatbot.\n\nTria is currently in stealth and raised its first pre-seed round in Q2 2023 from a total of 16 tier-one investors, angels, and advisors.\n\n**Traction to date**\n\n* Native naming service for a couple of top 20 CMC L1s (going live in Q2-Q3)\n* L1 and L2 Blockchains: Native onboarding solution to an L2 (announcing soon). In-talks along similar lines with 4 more (EVM, Polkadot, Cosmos, and Bitcoin ecosystem).\n* Dapps: 5+ mid-sized early customers have integrated Tria. 15+ in pipeline.\n* Enterprise Customers: In late-stage discussions with entities in the United Nations to implement Tria’s DIDs in humanitarian aid.\n* Ecosystems: Closely working with major ecosystems on DIDs, Onboarding, UX and Infrastructure. (to name a few – Polygon, Binance, Manta, Berachain, Fuse)\n\n**Product Journey**\n\n*Q2-3 2023*\n\n* Fundraise complete\n* Super Layer V1 development\n* Multi-chain wallet development across all major platforms (iOS, Android, Web and Extension)\n* Alpha Launch: IRL beta launch in Bali’s biggest co-working places\n\n*Q3-Q3 2023*\n\n* Super Layer V2 to facilitate cross-chain wallets and foster interconnected economies\n* B2B SDKs development\n  * Social onboarding (EOAs, Socials, Emails, and Mobile)\n  * Highly-customizable embedded wallet\n* AA-activation and test net on major EVMs.\n\n*Q4*\n\n* Backend Infra Upgrade to MPC-TSS (for enhanced security and decentralization)\n* Product UI/UX upgrades\n* Development of LLAMs and early SDK launches\n\n**2024 Product Roadmap**\n\n*Q1’2024*\n\n* Revamping the entire Frontend to a new look\n* Audits of SL and DID Contracts (Undergoing)\n* Extend SDK support on native mobile frameworks and Unity\n* WebApp controlled beta launch (with quests with partner dapps and ecosystem)\n* Mobile App controlled beta launch\n* LLAMs controlled beta launch (Whatsapp and iMessage)\n\n*Q2’2024 - Q4’2024*\n\n* Full-scale, public launch of all products\n* Airdrop season (Standalone and also with partner dapps and ecosystems)\n* SLV3 (Secret)\n\n**Tech**\n\nSuper Layer (SL) is a symphony of Web3 excellence – intersecting client-side primitives, peer-to-peer omni-chain communication, decentralized enclaves and ephemeral computation units – all purposed toward enabling a rich and wallet-less, composable Web3 UX.\n\nLearn more at *[Super Layer](https://tria.so/sl)*\n\nOver last 9 months our focus was buildinga solid backend and over the course of the next 3 months, our primary focus is revamping and re-designing the entire front end (UI/UX).\n\n**Links**\n\n*Demo Dapp:* https://demo-tria.vercel.app/ (WIP)\n*Customer Integration*: https://www.empireofsight.com/\n\n*Twitter*: https://twitter.com/useTria\n*Linkedin*: [https://www.linkedin.com/company/usetria](https://www.linkedin.com/company/usetria/mycompany/)\n*Website*: [https://www.tria.so](https://www.tria.so/)",

      "title": "Metis CEG Program: zk.Link",
      "content": "zkLink is a multi-chain infrastructure solution for high-performance ZK applications. zkLink’s flagship Layer 3 solution, Nexus, is based on zero-knowledge technology that aims to empower the next generation of decentralized trading products by improving performance while reducing the costs of trading DApps such as order book DEXs, AMMs, NFT marketplaces, and more.\n\nzkLink solves the problems related to liquidity fragmentation, multi-chain DApp deployment composability, blockchain navigation complexity and lastly, cross-chain transaction security. Using our SDK and zkSNARKS, zkLink connects various Layer 1 and Layer 2 ecosystems together, enabling native DeFi assets on distinct ecosystems to communicate between each other. This allows developers to easily facilitate multi-chain activity and DApp deployments in an efficient and secure manner.\n\nHow does zkLink ensure the security and privacy of user transactions?\n\nThe straightforward answer here is zero-knowledge-proof technology, in which our protocol employs zk-SNARKs to shield transaction information. While transactions are verified and recorded on the blockchain, details like sender, recipient, and transaction amount remain private.\n\nIn comparison to a classic ZK-Rollup architecture, zkLink employs a new type of ZK proof that simultaneously deploys the rollup contracts on multiple L1 blockchains and L2 networks at the same time. zkLink sends ZKPs to the Layer 2s who then submit the ZKPs to Ethereum, which are then verified by Ethereum smart contracts. Therefore, the transaction finality on a zkLink Nexus L3 rollup is ultimately achieved on Ethereum, which is widely recognized for its security guarantees. This is why we’re called a multi-chain ZK-Rollup.\n\nHow does zkLink simplify the user trading experience?\n\nzkLink offers interoperability by facilitating seamless token transfers across different blockchains and ZK-Rollup Layer 2s, eliminating the need for users to navigate complex processes when trading on multiple platforms. zkLink also provides a unified platform that aggregates liquidity from various chains, allowing users to access broader pools of liquidity and engage in more efficient trading experiences without worrying about slippage.\n\nValue Proposition of zkLink & Metis integration\n\nMulti-Chain Interoperability\ndApps developed on zkLink’s TS-zkVM or future TS-zkEVM will be able to seamlessly transact on Metis, leveraging assets from any other integrated chains on zkLink.\n\nLower Costs\nzkLink creates liquidity pools on every integrated chain. For regular token deposits and withdrawals, zkLink optimizes costs by executing orders in batches, resulting in significantly lower withdrawal costs per transaction. This cost-efficiency enhances the overall economic attractiveness of utilizing Metis and zkLink for decentralized trading.\n\nPrevious Work & Key Metrics\n\nThe Dunkirk Test: the crypto industry’s first-ever emergency shutdown and user asset recovery test\na. 71,050 Addresses claimed faucet\nb. 50,504 Performed asset recovery\nc. 329,400 Total Transactions\nd. 110,000+ zero-knowledge proofs were generated\n\nzkLink Nexus: the first ever cross-rollup Layer 3 solution launch\n\nzkLink Pioneer Program - a incentive program for community members to build and contribute to the zkLink ecosystem through free marketing efforts\n\nCommunity Growth:\na. 90+ Strategic Partnerships\nb. 16 Integrated Networks\nc. 2M+ Alpha Mainnet Txns\nd. 3 Ecosystem Dapps\ne. 52K+ Blocks Created\nf. 220K Mainnet Unique Wallet Addresses\n7. 500K+ Testnet Unique Wallet Addresses",

The LI.FI widget, SDK and API are used by >120 B2B integrations, among them big players such as Metamask and Phantom routing a large share of their bridging through LI.FI. Apart from that, LI.FI runs [Jumper](https://jumper.exchange/) as a direct interface to provide smart cross-chain routes to anyone.\n\nProject Links:\n\n* Website: https://li.fi/\n* Jumper: https://jumper.exchange/\n* Twitter: https://twitter.com/lifiprotocol\n* Github: https://github.com/lifinance\n* Documentation: https://docs.li.fi/\n\nKey Features\n\nProduct & Tech\n\nLI.FI is committed to facilitating swaps across the multi-chain ecosystem. We maintain the bridges, DEXs, and DEX aggregators integrations we already support.

      "content": "![image](ipfs://bafybeid46nz42ptfuaxulcqfzevfc4m7f5wublzmu5pu5royz2tmyjc5zi)\n    \nConnext is a modular interoperability protocol that allows near-instant and cost-effective crosschain transactions with best-in-class security. Through the use of an intent layer built atop the canonical bridges themselves, Connext is able to resolve the security-speed dichotomy often found in crosschain protocols.\n\nOur simple yet powerful interface allows developers to build crosschain applications that can interact with multiple domains (blockchains and/or rollups) simultaneously, resulting in powerful dApps that can securely interact with users, tokens, and other applications on any chain - just like on the web.\n\nProtocol Architecture & Security\nConnext utilizes a modular hub-and-spoke architecture, which derives its security from Ethereum L1 and plugs into the battle-tested canonical messaging bridges that underpin the security of each Ethereum-connected domain.\n\nMessages in Connext are added to a Merkle root generated on each spoke domain, which are then optimistically aggregated into a singular root on Ethereum L1. In the event that fraud is attempted, the system automatically falls back to using the canonical messaging bridge for each chain ecosystem.\n\nFor example, a message passed between Polygon and Optimism is secured by a proof posted to Ethereum and verified by the Polygon PoS bridge and Optimism roll-up bridge. Similarly, a message passed within the Cosmos ecosystem is verified by IBC.\n\nThis mechanism gives developers the best possible trust guarantees for whichever chains they want to build on. For fraud to occur in our Polygon to Optimism example, there would need to be a compromise of Polygon or Optimism’s canonical bridges and Connext’s failsafe mechanisms.\n\nConnext Vision, Objectives, and Value\nConnext aims to bring several key benefits to the Metis ecosystem, including:\n\nFast and cost-effective bridging of ETH, USDC, USDT, METIS, and more between major blockchains and L2s\n\nPowerful crosschain tooling, allowing developers to build crosschain-native applications and DAOs\n\nSupport for xERC20 tokens, allowing for fast, zero-slippage crosschain transactions of supported tokens\n\nKey Resources\nWebsite: https://www.connext.network\nDocs: https://docs.connext.network\nAudits: https://audits.connext.network\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/ConnextNetwork\nDiscord: https://discord.g/connext\nBlog: https://blog.connext.network",

      "title": "Metis CEG Program: Artemis Finance to Launch on Metis",
      "content": "## **Introducing Artemis Finance**\n\nArtemis Finance is a liquid staking protocol designed exclusively for Metis Decentralised Sequencer Pools. Users can stake their METIS token on Artemis Finance and receive the liquid token - artMETIS.\n\nAs a member protocol of NGAD, Artemis Finance is committed to contributing to the dynamic growth of the $METIS ecosystem and fostering the development of the on-chain economy.\n\n## Value Proposition\n\n**Liquid Staking Solution for Metis**\n\nArtemis allows you to earn staking rewards by delegating your METIS to sequencers. In exchange, you receive a receipt token - artMETIS that represents your staked positions.\n\n**Innovative Use Case**\n\nartMETIS serves as a versatile asset within the Metis ecosystem. It will be utilized in various protocols such as trading, lending, and a wide range of DeFi use cases.\n\n**Decentralized Sequencing with Capital Efficiency**\n\nCapital efficiency is a crucial factor in advancing decentralized sequencing. By optimizing resource allocation, Artemis paves the way for a truly decentralized ecosystem.\n\n## **The Benefits to Metis Network**\n\nArtemis is committed to enhancing the liquidity and making Artemis more robust and appealing to LST enthusiasts. We strive to provide users with increased asset availability for trading and investment, strengthening Artemis's position as a leading permissionless Layer 2 network.\n\n1. **Increasing TVL and Growing METIS Liquidity** Artemis strives to bring a significant amount of TVL and liquidity to the Artemis ecosystem. Through the METIS locked on Artemis, stakers will be entitled to earn additional staking rewards which will attract more METIS holders to enter into the market. This infusion of funds will enhance the overall liquidity of Metis.\n2. **Broadening User Adoption** The key idea behind Artemis is to align METIS holders and sequencers to make the best possible use of their assets and maximize incentives to all participants. Moreover, Artemis will use the well-built networks of KOLs and influencers to drive more attention and interest towards Metis. Their influence can attract new users and investors to the platform, further increasing TVL and participation within the ecosystem.\n3. **Building a Strong Online Presence** We will produce regular blog posts, videos, and infographics to educate the community about our platform and its unique features, and encourage discussions, knowledge sharing, and collaboration. We collaborate with influencers who have tweets or RTs of LST content and other related protocols to amplify the reach of the content.\n\nWe are dedicated to introducing new users and innovative features to the ecosystem, creating a hub for exploration and growth. Artemis's incentives not only fuel our growth but also act as a catalyst for the broader Metis ecosystem's expansion.\n\n**Migrate Existing Projects and Liquidity Partners**\n\nNGAD is a foundation DAO dedicated to pioneering the future of asset growth and expanding the horizons of Liquid Staked Tokens (LST), and has successfully incubated Equilibria Finance and Euclid Finance.\n\n**Equilibria Finance: Growth Engine for LSDFi**\n\nEquilibria is a protocol built on top of Pendle Finance and is designed to enhance the yields of Liquidity Providers (LPs) through the accumulation of vePENDLE tokens on our platform.\n\nKey Stats：\n\n* We managed to lock approximately 7.8 million PENDLE tokens(= $10 M) on our platform, which account for 24% of the total vePENDLE supply.\n* Our TVL as of Jan 2024 is $80M across 4 networks.\n* references:[DUNE](https://dune.com/lxx1233/equilibria-finance), [Defillama](https://defillama.com/protocol/equilibria)\n\n**Euclid Finance: Bring ETH and BTC LST Protocols to Metis**\n\nOur objective is to extend the staking rewards from the ETH mainnet or BTC to Layer 2 networks, enabling participation for Layer 2 users. Given its status as the most innovative and decentralized Layer 2 network, Metis is exceptionally well-positioned to be the central and pioneering network for our OmniChain Liquid Staking Token (LST). Therefore, we propose to bring the ETH and BTC LST protocols to the Metis ecosystem, anticipating that ETH restaking and BTC staking will become prominent narratives. The potential market size and user engagement are incredibly promising and will bring substantial TVL and user interaction to the Metis Network. This could propel Metis to become the leading Layer 2 platform in key market matrices.\n\n**Benefit to Metis ecosystem projects:** Artemis's initiatives extend beyond its own growth, serving as catalysts for the broader expansion of the ecosystem. Through incentivizing user participation, liquidity provision, governance engagement, and protocol support, we aim to establish a self-sustaining cycle of growth. This comprehensive strategy benefits the entire Artemis community by fostering a vibrant and thriving ecosystem. Additionally, Artemis stands to gain from Equilibria’s multi-chain expertise. The presence on various chains, including Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, Optimism, and more, allows Artemis to tap into a wider audience and diverse user base. This multi-chain approach promotes innovation through cross-chain interactions and introduces novel ideas and projects to the Artemis ecosystem.\n\n## **Roadmap**\n\n1. Development & Testnet launch;\n2. Completed the contract audits;\n3. IDO Launch & Prelaunch Campaign;\n4. Full launch on Metis with restaking features;\n5. Listing artMETIS on DEs and provide liquidity and incentives;\n6. Onboarding & widen Strategy partners.\n\n**Audits:** Will be complete by Peckshield before Prelaunch campaign in Feb.\n\n**Summary**\n\nArtemis is committed to extend staking rewards from ETH mainnet and BTC to Layer 2 networks, positioning Metis as the central hub for our OmniChain Liquid Staking Token. Artemis is dedicated to delivering interoperable solutions, contributing to Metis' growth and eagerly anticipating community support for a successful collaboration.\n\n**Contact Us;**\n\nEmail: [market@equilibria.fi](mailto:market@equilibria.fi)\n\nSocial **Links:**\n\nTwitter/X: https://twitter.com/Artemisfinance\n\nWebsite:https://artemisfinance.io/",

      "content": "![image](ipfs://bafybeiaxngcxppo6jr4gmkwtkdwqxbnqocjb52mvvrhzsrvet34s6gxpmq)\n    \nOmni is a restaking secured blockchain purpose built to connect all of Ethereum’s rollups, empowering developers to build apps across all L2s.\nWith the launch of rollups, the Ethereum ecosystem has solved the problem of expensive transactions. However, this has come at the cost of fragmentation. Now users, their capital and applications are scattered across an array of rollup solutions. Through leveraging new technologies like restaking, Omni solves this fragmentation by providing by far the most secure and simple way to deploy cross-rollup applications for Ethereum developers.\n\nThe Open Liquidity Network\nFor our next testnet, we are working with a number of projects (Injective, Flow, Sei, Sushi, and more) to embrace existing open standards, such as xERC-20 (see more below), and push for new ones. These standards will allow tokens to be natively accessible across all EVM chains. We will be spinning up a number of gamified apps on our testnet to test these standards ahead of our mainnet launch.\n\nProposal for Metis\nWe want Metis to give us support to mint a testnet xERC20 (new open token standard pioneered by EIP-7281) version of $METIS on Arbitrum, Optimism and Polygon rollups (all in testnet environment) so that we can load test our network ahead of launch.\n\nWe will run missions on testnet dApps for users to move these xERC20 tokens across the rollups. We have a suite of apps specifically designed to do this in a gamefied way to help bring Metis additional attention.\n\nThere is no dev work needed on the Metis end, just support to test our network with a testnet xERC20 version of $METIS. We are also happy to add reLSTs, LSTs, etc, as there are potentially many opportunities for Metis-native tokens to reach new networks.\n\nPractically, the only work on the Metis side would be a couple tweets and quote tweets to announce the partnership.\n\nBenefits\nOpen standards like xERC-20 allow tokens to be natively deployed on any EVM chain. This removes the need for wrapped/bridge tokens. This means that liquidity becomes unified across all chains. Users would be able to access their native $METIS on any chain that supports it. This opens doors for all kinds of seamless interoperability.\n\nRelevant Resources\n\nOmni\nWebsite: https://omni.network/ 1\nDocs: https://docs.omni.network/\nBlog: https://blog.omni.network/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/OmniFDN\n\nxERC-20\nWebsite: https://www.xerc20.com/ 1\n\nThe Open Liquidity Network\nhttps://x.com/OmniFDN/status/1743287906184159439?s=20",

Replete does so by leveraging cross-chain infrastructure powered by LayerZero and the various bridging routes provided by Stargate.\n\nReplete is designed to not require supply side liquidity on connected chains, this allows the protocol to scale to more chains and cover more routes for users. This means that users can supply from and borrow to any connected chain while retaining the various benefits of a single liquidity pool.\n\nThis proposal is intended to formalize the relationship with Metis and present the protocol to the community and fine folks governing MetisDAO as we seek feedback and actors to test the protocol.\n\n**How does Metis benefit from Replete?**\n\nDirectly it benefits Metis by being one of the partners utilizing the Stargate bridge. Bringing revenue to LPs in the form of bridging fees and helping increase incentives for providing liquidity.\n\nUsers wanting to supply to Replete earn on liquidity provided across all connected chains instead of solely Metis. In other words, a supplier on Metis earns from all connected markets as their assets are made available across connected blockchains.\n\nAdditionally, with enough demand and provided the Metis token follows OFT standard, Replete can add a market for Metis token. Unlocking for Metis stakeholders a liquidity avenue that users can redeploy (at the cost of interest) on either Metis or any connected chain.\n\nPerhaps more interesting is that Replete helps users to discover Metis as one of the first routes supported, meaning that users that want to explore Metis can do so without having to swap to bridgeable assets, dramatically improving user experience and facilitating a new route for users to be onboard to Metis.\n\n**How does Replete benefit from Metis?**\n\nMetis is one of the chains that was pre-emptively selected to deploy Replete to. That decision is based on the aspirations of Metis governance, which is a source of inspiration for core contributors to Replete Finance.\n\nWith utilization of the protocol comes also revenue, deploying to Metis is a potential source of revenue that is distributed to suppliers and Replete treasury.\n\nAdditionally, becoming a Community Verified Project (CVP) grants Replete Finance exposure to the vibrant Metis community. Ideally, in the future, translating to users whom can participate in the incentive programs and become part of the Replete DAO.\n\nHowever, at this stage of the protocol, it is simply to present Replete and seek help from the Metis community in spotting flaws, giving feedback and honest to god criticism when something is broken once testnet is launched.\n\n**Token Utility**\n\nAt present Replete does not have a token nor will a user ever be required to have a token to use the protocol. At TGE the tokens associated with the Replete Protocol are used to govern Replete. Users whom have Replete tokens, can vote and decide on the outcome through Replete Improvement Proposal (RIP).\n\nMoreover, at launch, the token can be staked to secure the protocol through a safety module, which provides security to the protocol and insures (to an extent) the position of suppliers. Note that this is optional and more will be disclosed prior deployment to mainnet.\n\nIn terms of emission the vision is to reward those who provide value at different stages during the evolution of the protocol. That is to say, that testing the protocol during testnet is something that provides value to the protocol.\n\nWe want to stress that there is **__NO REPLETE TOKENS IN CIRCULATION AS OF YET :rotating_light:__**.\n\n**Roadmap**\n\nReplete has been in development for the majority of 2023 and core contributors decided early on to not create a whitepaper. The flexibility allowed the contributors to focus and reiterate on ideas while fine tuning what Replete is becoming as it inches closer to testnet and launch.\n\nThat being said, Replete has had a total of three pivots to reach the current stage of maturity and contributors are more comfortable disclosing advancements as the vision and the route of becoming a self-sustainable DAO becomes clearer.\n\nAs for the roadmap, with V1 the goal for Replete is to be deployed on a multitude of chains and provide valuable experience for users on each of them. The expansion to chains is not solely rooted in expanding the surface area of operations but is also a more practical approach for features contributors have in mind for the protocol with V2.\n\nWhilst V1 is geared towards expansion with V2 optimizing revenue sources is the vision, as the goal is for the Replete DAO to be able to stand on its own legs. Without being too vague, sizeable engineering efforts have been made to make these a reality and more will be disclosed once contributors are closer to deployment.\n\nIn terms of deliverables, the aim is to launch to Metis Goerli testnet in ~February 2024. Followed by mainnet after successful completion of a security audit. Replete aims to be the one of the most connected liquidity markets in the industry by supporting over 8 chains at launch. From there, the deliverables are to connect more markets and support more assets until V2 is ready for release.\n\n**Security**\n\nDuring the testnet phase no auditors will be engaged, this is because testnet functions as an environment for testing the protocol and for contributors to spot and fix errors prior submitting the code to auditors.\n\nNeedless to say, the protocol will not launch to mainnet unless a security audit is conducted by an accredited auditor, as it is ultimately important the protocol is as safe as possible for users to use. This means that the audit and the period of testnet dictates when exactly Replete is integrated to Andromeda mainnet.\n\n**Learn more about Replete**\n\nFeel free to leave your feedback on Candidac or reach out on Discord with any questions you may have.\n\n* Website: https://replete.fi/\n* Discord: https://discord.com/invite/E3NVGCeEvX\n* Twitter/X: https://twitter.com/RepleteFinance\n* Docs: [https://docs.replete.fi/](https://docs.replete.fi/intro/introduction)",

      "title": "Metis CEG Program:  Star Protocol – Omni-chain Name Service Provider Launching .metis",
      "content": "**Introducing the Metis Omni-chain Domain Name System ‘.metis’**\n\nStar Protocol is an omni-chain name service provider currently deployed on 29 networks with over 370,000 unique wallet addresses using their existing omni-chain name service. The following information outlines their approach for launching a Metis domain name system.\n\n**.metis Top-Level Domain Launch**\n\nWhile the Star Protocol operates on Metis network already, allowing cross-chain compatibility for existing domain holders, Star proposes the launch of an official Metis DNS. This initiative involves introducing an updated .metis top-level domain.\n\n**Universal Identity Layer on Metis**\n\nRecent proliferation of web3 DNS has resulted in fragmented systems across Layer 1 (L1) and Layer 2 (L2) networks, lacking interoperability and omni-chain compatibility.\n\nUsing Layer Zero technology, Star protocol seamlessly interacts across multiple blockchain networks, ensuring its compatibility with a wide spectrum of DNS applications. This cross-chain capability not only extends the reach of the protocol's services but also fosters a more interconnected and comprehensive community.\n\nWith over 500,000 registrations and 370,000+ active wallet addresses, Star's extensive reach highlights its significance within the evolving web3 ecosystem.\n\n**Leveraging Network of Partners.**\n\nStar Protocol will leverage the technical capabilities of [Consensys](https://x.com/star_protocol/status/1714925565000749516?s=20), given their existing partnership through the Scale Accelerator program. Combined with the distribution effects of their 282 partnerships within the L1 & L2 network ecosystem. Leading to increased exposure and utility of .metis on supported dApps across multiple networks.\n\n**Unique characteristics of Star Protocol**\n\n**Advanced omni-chain interoperability:** Employs an interconnected DNS to facilitate a streamlined user experience across Web3.\n\n**Omni-chain resolution API**: Streamlining DNS integration into Metis dApps for omni-chain resolution to abstract 0x hash addresses and facilitate send/receive functionality.\n\n**End-to-end TLD registration, management, UI & UX design**: A dedicated website for the Metis DNS will be created. The Star team will establish a unique X/Twitter Channel, a Discord space, and customized roles for .metis holders. This setup will coordinate campaigns with various Metis ecosystem projects. Moreover, a specialized business development team and budget will oversee .metis operations.\n\n**Dedicated network of partners** Star Protocol will leverage Consensys’ technical capabilities and our 282 L1 & L2 network partnerships to boost .metis exposure and utility on dApp integrations like Syncswap & Dmail.\n\n**Preview**\n\n1. Live UI example for Star's existing Kroma Network DNS; https://kromans.domains (Updated based on design & branding guidelines of Metis Network)\n\n![Star1.jpeg](ipfs://bafkreiex3pgojx54ll76ywvsgczjlnge4sq4x6f7zxawcfplokxi6osm7u)\n\n2. Platform Diagram\n\n \n![Star2.png](ipfs://bafkreiatdkxuiccirmsz5pz7h5mlgfmikcjh2nrsh75oc6pfqwfk4gtxea)\n    \n\n\n**Audit Report**: Completed by Secure3.io (Founders of CertiK) > https://secure3.io/audit/StarEvm\n\n\n**The Benefits to Metis Network**\n\nStar's proposal aims to enhance the user experience on the Metis Network by implementing an omnichain name service that leverages distribution affects of the existing Star ecosystem.\n\n**Benefits to user;** Enabling necessary infrastructure for Metis network identity solutions. In the form of personal DID's and unique web3 user names for .metis holders to improve user experience within the Metis ecosystem.\n\n**Benefit to Metis ecosystem projects;** Seamless integration with an omni-chain API combined with Improved user onboarding and retention by leveraging name resolution directly into user interfaces within project dApps.\n\n\nIntegration Examples\n\n**Wallet** - Abstract away 0x hash address to resolve ‘.metis’ TLD. Send/receive directly to the ‘.metis’ TLD\n\n**Explorer** - Resolve names on the Metis blockchain explorer replacing all 0x hash addresses of domain holders.\n\n**Marketplace** - Enable ‘.metis’ domain holders to trade their domains.\n\n\n**Roadmap**\n\n1. ‘.Metis’ registration and management (Phase 1)\n2. UI website design and integration with support for multiple Web3 wallets. (Phase 2) Wallets Currently Supported; Metamask, OKX Web3, Bitkeep, C98 Super Wallet\n3. Cross-chain bridge integration with LayerZero Labs (Phase 3)\n4. Metis Native/3rd Party Integrations; Explorer & Wallets (Phase 3)\n5. Reward System Integration (Phase 4)\n6. NFT Marketplace listing for trading .Metis domains. Can be incorporated with the native/3rd party marketplace first and then into the Star Name Service Omnichain Marketplace later) (Phase 4)\n\n\n**Summary**\n\nStar Protocol proposes to deploy an omnichain name service on the Metis network with the .metis TLD with live launch scheduled for as soon as the Metis communities approve the respective governance proposals.\n\n**Contact Us;**\n\nEmail; team@star.co\n\n**Links;**\n\nTwitter/X; https://twitter.com/star_protocol\n\nDiscord; https://discord.com/invite/KqR8Tr57Kw\n\nWebsite; https://sns.so/",

      "content": "**Thrilled to announce that our Node API is live on Metis Mainnet and globally available for all builders out there!**\n\n \n![06bf51adf231567b04fd6da58097555944f0679a.jpeg](ipfs://bafkreigudnk7eeqd6ju6fs3p23ut3gkhx4o3yigrh3k7lgsox3zyzcjona)\n    \n\n**Briefly about us**\nWe're NOWNodes - a web3 development tool that provides instant access to blockchain nodes, block explorers and powers websocket connections via the API. We support over 95+ blockchain networks including Metis. Our API serves as a gateway between developers of decentralized applications and the ledger data.\n\n**Tech Utilities and Features**\nWe offer hosting services for Metis RPC full blockchain node. This means developers and businesses don't have to go through the complex and resource-intensive process of setting up and maintaining their own Metis nodes. It is essential for big exchanges and crypto wallets as they can seamlessly use Metis on-chain data and integrate Metis easier and faster - without hosting and running their own node instances.\n\nOur Metis Node API supports all official RPC methods and has scalability of more than 10K requests per second. This is sustained and supported by extended hardware capacities and sufficient uplink metrics for the input and output requests.\n\nWe provide full documentation and global access to Metis on several plans - including free tier that lasts for one month. It means that you can access Metis RPC Full Nodes with no payment. Each builder can access our 24/7 engineering and nodeOps support to perform instant possible troubleshooting.\n\n**🎶UNIQUE - is what you are**\nWe know how frustrating rate limits may be for developers and crypto enterprises. Being limited in the number of API requests means the disruption of the payments and transactions of Metis. This is one of the reasons why we implemented zero RPS limit to the Metis RPC Full Nodes on all paid plans.\n\nOur nodes are distributed globally to serve users from different regions: Europe + Middle East, America and Asia. Using our decentralized infrastructure for the API service, we manage to provide close-to-zero latency for selected networks.\n\nHaving a secure environment for blockchain interactions, we never share the names of our users with the community unless partners are willing to do so. This makes us different from other blockchain node providers that may include this obligation into Terms and Conditions. Additionally, we neither can't nor don't want to know what kind requests you're sending to your Metis node. \n\n**The Roadmap**\nCurrently, we entered the Phase 1 with the global launch of Metis Node API on Mainnet. Depending on the ecosystem development, our next steps will be to deploy and release Metis API instance on Testnet and bring more publicly available tools for builders. \n\n**Official Links**\nOur Website - https://nownodes.io/\nOur Partners - https://nownodes.io/partners\nMetis at NOWNodes - https://nownodes.io/metis\nMetis Documentation - https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/13630829/TVmFkLwy#a6cbcd04-f682-45fe-ba79-4f79d2bc5411",

      "title": "After a Successful DAO Vote, we decided to Launch the 1 Phase of the $gMETIS Distribution",
      "content": "Background\nMetisDAO governance is considering altering Metis Gold allocation rate, a newly approved function where 1% of bridge volume fees are converted to $gMETIS. $gMETIS has the potential to increase bridge transaction volume and reward holders, but will $METIS face market cap reduction if a derivative token supply is increased, or will the increase in bridge volume contribute to greater value for users. \n\n- Proposal\nIncrease $gMETIS from 1% of bridge volume fees to 2% bridge volume to further incentive bridge usage and reward the METIS community. Maintain $gMETIS biannual rewards distribution timeline to incentive bridge prioritization and bolster market sentiment. Currently, for every $1M of bridge volume, $10,000 will be allocated to the $sGOLD treasury. This proposal is suggesting to contribute $20,000 to $gMETIS for every $1M of bridge volume, which will later be distributed to bridge users based on wallet activity. A majority vote of 51% or greater is required for the protocol to implement this new addition. \n\n- What is $gMETIS and when is the first distribution?\nMetisDAO has voted to implement $gMETIS rewards for the first distribution which is live for users from January 18, 2024 to January 30, 2024. Each $METIS holder is eligibility if their wallet is older than 7 days and they have made a txn with $METIS. $Gmetis distribution rate will be based on wallet solvency levels and bridge volume. \n\nIf you haven't already, check [HERE](https://metis.gl/) if you are eligibility for the Phase 1 $gMETIS Rewards Distribution. \n\n- Execution\nIf this proposal receives a majority vote of 51% of greater, $gMETIS treasury allocation rate will be increase from 1% to 2% to further reward bridge users and hopefully increase overall bridge volume. \n\nIf the new rewards allocation rate is accepted it will be implement in the 2024 Q1 distribution. \n\nDon't forget to check if you are eligible for the Phase 1 $gMETIS distribution if you have been an active $METIS trader and bridge user. \n\n![1__IFHN00I3ribcq4RDn2LMQ.jpg](ipfs://bafkreifouzvf6xyrdoewtbevii4fwqxdgnyrcgtvllj6epq3g2ohhpjnnu)",

      "title": "After a Successful DAO Vote, Metis decided to Launch the 1 Phase of the $gMETIS Distribution",
      "content": "Background\nMetisDAO governance is considering altering Metis Gold allocation rate, a newly approved function where 1% of bridge volume fees are converted to $gMETIS. $gMETIS has the potential to increase bridge transaction volume and reward holders, but will $METIS face market cap reduction if a derivative token supply is increased, or will the increase in bridge volume contribute to greater value for users. \n\n- Proposal\nIncrease $gMETIS from 1% of bridge volume fees to 2% bridge volume to further incentive bridge usage and reward the METIS community. Maintain $gMETIS biannual rewards distribution timeline to incentive bridge prioritization and bolster market sentiment. Currently, for every $1M of bridge volume, $10,000 will be allocated to the $sGOLD treasury. This proposal is suggesting to contribute $20,000 to $gMETIS for every $1M of bridge volume, which will later be distributed to bridge users based on wallet activity. A majority vote of 51% or greater is required for the protocol to implement this new addition. \n\n- What is $gMETIS and when is the first distribution?\nMetisDAO has voted to implement $gMETIS rewards for the first distribution which is live for users from January 18, 2024 to January 30, 2024. Each $METIS holder is eligibility if their wallet is older than 7 days and they have made a txn with $METIS. $Gmetis distribution rate will be based on wallet solvency levels and bridge volume. \n\nIf you haven't already, check [HERE](https://launchpad-metis.com/) if you are eligibility for the Phase 1 $gMETIS Rewards Distribution. \n\n- Execution\nIf this proposal receives a majority vote of 51% of greater, $gMETIS treasury allocation rate will be increase from 1% to 2% to further reward bridge users and hopefully increase overall bridge volume. \n\nIf the new rewards allocation rate is accepted it will be implement in the 2024 Q1 distribution. \n\nDon't forget to check if you are eligible for the Phase 1 $gMETIS distribution if you have been an active $METIS trader and bridge user. \n\n![1__IFHN00I3ribcq4RDn2LMQ.jpg](ipfs://bafkreifouzvf6xyrdoewtbevii4fwqxdgnyrcgtvllj6epq3g2ohhpjnnu)",

      "title": "CVP Proposal: Launch HYVE on Metis as the first onchain job marketplace",
      "content": "### Introduction\n\nHYVE is currently the largest native web3 job platform, catering to freelancers worldwide. As a platform, HYVE currently accepts over 200 different currencies (including METIS on ETH mainnet) and supports transactions on 7 different blockchains (ETH, BNB, Fantom, Polygon, AVAX, Cronos, Aurora, and soon Metis). Payment is done through escrow contracts, ensuring a swift and safe collaboration.\n\nThe latest update on HYVE brought digital items; meaning users can now create all sorts of downloadable content and sell it, creating passive income streams for creators on the platform. Anything downloadable goes, from ebook and audiobooks to notion templates and website templates and even to games, courses, icon packs and many others.\n\nGenerally, HYVE charges a 2.5% fee on all transactions - which we will waive for Metis users for a limited time!\n\n### HYVE on Metis\n\n- We will deploy HYVE on METIS, making HYVE _the first job marketplace on METIS._\n\n- In addition to integrating METIS, _we will also integrate 5-10 tokens from the METIS ecosystem_, as voted by the community.\n\n- Users will be able to find jobs and _get paid in METIS or other coins on the METIS blockchain._\n\n- _For at least 1 year after METIS has been implemented, we will waive the 2.5% fee usually applied to transactions._ This will make it free for you to find jobs or hire people, while enjoying all the benefits of the escrow payment system.\n\n- _HYVE is already in touch with the METIS team and has integrated METIS token (but not the blockchain) as a payment option a few months ago._ Integrating METIS blockchain would be the next logical step in our collaboration.\n\n### Audit\n\nHYVE is audited by CERTIK - https://skynet.certik.com/projects/hyve\n\n### Roadmap\n\nHYVE has completed its initial roadmap a while ago, but has been pushing full steam ahead - our plans for 2024 can be found here: https://latest.hyve.works/diary-log-year-24-068/\n\n### Summary\n\nHYVE will be the first decentralised on-chain job marketplace on METIS, and will waive fees for METIS users. HYVE is audited, and has been live for several years on other chains.\n\n### Links\n\nWebsite: https://www.hyve.works/ \n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/join_hyve\n\nCoingecko: https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/hyve\n\nTelegram: @hyveworks",

      "title": "MIP-4: Decentralize Testnet Sequencer and Activate Community Testing",
      "content": "**Abstract**\n\nThis is a proposal to decentralize the Testnet sequencer and activate Season 1 of Community Testing. Five innovative DeFi dApps will be at the forefront of this activity, facilitating activities and competitions throughout Season 1.\n\n**Purpose**\n\nThe purpose of this proposal is to properly decentralize the sequencer infrastructure deployed on Testnet, and to activate Community Testing to help Metis developers stress-test the new architecture.\n\n**Background**\n\nRollups were born to scale Ethereum while leveraging its security and decentralization. To do so, rollups must be able to inherit these guarantees from the underlying blockchain (Ethereum), and they can only do it by implementing 2 key components: A decentralized proving system, and a Decentralized Sequencer. Most rollups are currently working on launching or improving their fraud-proof mechanisms, but no one, until now, was working on the other key 50%: decentralizing the Sequencer. Metis has been working on both.\n\nLater in 2024, Metis will launch a decentralizing zero-knowledge proof system. This will enhance security, decentralization, and will shorten the finality-time, which has historically been the main pain point for Optimistic Rollups. But, let’s come back to January. Metis is soon to launch the first-ever Decentralized Sequencer. This will eliminate the single point of failure that all Ethereum L2s are currently subject to, and it will enable:\n\n* Enhanced censorship-resistance\n* 24/7 liveness\n* Enhanced security\n* Revenue sharing\n\nIt’s certainly an exciting time for the Metis ecosystem, and the best thing is:\n\nAll community members can directly contribute to the deployment of the Decentralized Sequencer, without needing any coding knowledge, by participating in Community Testing.\n\n## Proposal\n\nMetis proposes Season 1 of Community Testing to kick off on Monday, January 15, focused on incentivizing interactions with dApps.\n\nEach dApp will have different actions that can be performed by users to earn points, such as swaps, opening long/short positions, and more, depending on each of the participant decentralized applications (dApps). The dApps that will be participating in Season 1 are:\n\n* League.Tech\n* Tethys Finance\n* Midas Games\n* Netswap\n* Hummus Finance\n\n#### [League.Tech](https://league.tech/)\n\nThe upcoming SocialFi platform on Metis that built on top of existing participants like Friend.tech, but also introduces innovative features on top, such as a unique shorting mechanism, dynamic reputation and badge system, League creation and betting, and a three-tiered access model.\n\n#### [Tethys Finance](https://tethys.finance/trade)\n\nPerpetual contracts trading platform (Perps DEX) that allows users to trade BTC, ETH, AAVE, and METIS with up to 50x leverage. Additionally, liquidity providers can stake TLP, and bet against the traders.\n\n#### [Midas Games](https://www.midas.game/)\n\nOn-chain prediction market games, starting with a new lottery game!\n\n#### [Netswap](https://netswap.io/#/home)\n\nDecentralized Exchange and Launchpad enabling swaps, and allowing users to provide liquidity in V2 pools.\n\n#### [Hummus Finance](https://www.hummus.exchange/)\n\nSingle-sided AMM focused on Stable Swaps. Users can swap stable crypto assets with minimal slippage, and liquidity providers can provide funds with minimal impermanent loss risk. Hummus recently added weighted pools, allowing liquidity providers to pair stables with BTC, ETH, and METIS too, thus creating deeper liquidity.\n\n**Mechanics**\n\nThe rules for Community Testing are quite simple. Everyone can participate in it, and users will earn points based on which and how many actions they’ve performed in the different dApps. However, there are some important mechanics to take into consideration for a successful performance:\n\n**Token Mint**\n\nThe following table describes the amount of Testnet tokens distributed to the users depending on how early they joined the airdrop (distributed in different tokens):\n\n|Earliness|<100 users|<500 users|<2000 users|<10000 users|Remaining users|\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|$ Amount|10,000|5,000|2,000|500|200|\n\nSimply put, the first 100 users will receive $10,000 in Testnet tokens; the first 500 participants, $5,000 in Testnet tokens; the first 2,000 participants, $2,000 in Testnet tokens; the first 10,000 users, $500 in Testnet tokens; and all users joining later will receive $200 in Testnet tokens\n\n**Points**\n\nAll participants will be able to earn the same amount of points by completing each action.\n\nBut there’s a twist!\n\nIf the dollar amount held by a participant is larger than their points amount, their points will be replaced by their Testnet dollar amount. So, you want to make it early to the Community Testing Token Mint!\n\n**Repeated Actions**\n\nFor repeated actions, each time a participant completes an action after their first attempt, they will receive 75% the amount of points as the previous attempts. This will encourage completion of all tasks on all participant dApps, given the first tries will be the ones worth the most points.\n\nHowever, it’s important to keep in mind that potential rewards will be proportional to the participants’ ranks, based on points. Participants will be encouraged to earn as many points as possible.\n\n**Boosters**\n\nEach day, the official Metis handle will share a riddle or question that will offer a specific boost. Some will offer a fixed amount of points, some will offer a 1.25x boost for the participant’s points, and some will have different benefits. Turn notifications on for @MetisDAO on [X](https://twitter.com/MetisDAO)!\n\n## TL;DR\n\nThe proposal aims to decentralize the Testnet Sequencer and activate Community Testing. Assuming the community votes YES, Season 1 of Community Testing will begin on Monday, January 15. Season 1 will incentivize interaction with dApps, and will help the Metis developers stress-test the Decentralized Sequencer. We encourage the Metis community to go over the proposal comprehensively Today, and get ready to vote Tomorrow!\n\nVote will be up from Thursday, Jan 11th 2024, and will be live for 72 hours.",

      "content": "# Abstract\n\nThis is a proposal to update the Community Verified Projects (CVP) process to ensure that projects launching within the Metis Ecosystem get sufficient promotional support from the Metis Ecosystem through the CVP program as a core part of Community Ecosystem Governance (CEG).\n\n# Purpose\n\nThrough community feedback received by the team regarding the current CVP processes, we are proposing a change that will update the CVP to allow for more decentralized operation and decision making power by the community on choosing projects to promote within the Metis Ecosystem.\n\n# Proposal\n\n* Enabling the community to submit a proposal directly on the [Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/metislayer2.eth) (community member submitting the proposal should have at least 10 METIS)\n  * The previous system only allows a Snapshot proposal to be created by the governance team\n* No mandatory requirements to submit a proposal, only recommended guidelines\n  * The previous system had [mandatory requirements](https://docs.candidac.org/community-verified-projects/proposal-requirements) that were reviewed and approved by the governance team before a Snapshot proposal was created\n* No manual review by the governance team\n  * The previous system had a manual review process that approved or rejected projects based on successfully fulfilling the [requirements](https://docs.candidac.org/community-verified-projects/proposal-requirements)\n* Voting Period - 72 hours\n* A quorum requirement of 10k METIS tokens and 500 addresses participating\n  * The previous system had no quorum requirement\n* \\>80% approval vote to pass\n  * No change from the previous system\n* Transferring Metis Governance forum from https://candidac.org to https://ceg.vote\n  * The previous location for the Metis Governance Forum was https://candidac.org.\n* Addition of their project into a list of approved CVP - https://projects.ceg.vote [in-development]\n  * The previous system had a CVP verified badge on the [Metis Ecosystem](https://metis.io/ecosystem) page\n* Introduction of an Offboarding Process\n  * The previous system did not have an offboarding process\n\n## Offboarding Process\n\nThe community may begin the process of removing the project if it uncovers malicious events that harm the ecosystem.\n\nExamples of the events:\n  * Website unreachable\n  * Socials deleted (Twitter, Discord, Telegram, etc.)\n  * Liquidity is removed, resulting in a significant price impact (>80%)\n  * Discovery of security risk through a contract vulnerability\n  * Inactive groups\n  * No project activity\n\n### Process\n\n1. A proposal is created for the project offboarding in the Metis Governance Forum, the proposal needs to specify the reason for the offboarding\n2. A Snapshot is created and the offboarding follows the quorum, approval, and time requirements of the onboarding process\n3. If the proposal passes, then the project will be removed from the https://projects.ceg.vote [in-development] page\n\nThis is a large proposal that will make a significant change to the current CVP process. I hope that this proposal makes the CVP program more impactful to both the projects and the community.",

      "content": "![5b2706abb3cadc4e9c2938a2a86b9e3d5edb860c_2_1380x776.jpeg](ipfs://bafybeihpkujy5lkti6qqczwhn5oixlk6qnnni2zreyxkx3crb7lbhi6pfq)\n    \n\n## Introduction\n\nSolidly is a cutting-edge concentrated liquidity DEX. It has achieved significant improvements over existing solutions:\n\n**1. Concentrated Liquidity**\n\nSolidly offers a concentrated liquidity AMM, which increases capital efficiency in comparison to traditional AMMs by factors of thousands. The intuitive UX allows users to provide liquidity in preset ranges such as \"Narrow\", \"Balanced\", \"Wide\" and \"Full Range\". Expert users can also provide their liquidity in custom ranges, in whichever liquidity shape they desire. Talks are being held with several ALMs who will incorporate Solidly into their automated management suites.\n\n**2. JIT Protection**\n\nA long-standing issue of CLAMM Dexes such as Uniswap V3 has been so-called \"JIT liquidity\". It's the predatory practice of big funds providing liquidity in 2-tick ranges, extracting all fees from honest and loyal LPs. Solidly completely solved this issue with its innovative in-house merkle processor, which automatically filters out any JIT attacks as they occur.\n\n**3. Gas Savings**\n\nOne of the big features of Solidly is its gas savings against existing DEX solutions. Solidly has achieved up to 42% swap gas savings, and up to 60% for mints & burns (rebalancing) vs Uniswap V3. This allowed it to achieve highest capital efficiency of any CLAMM DEX on mainnet as of today. It may be less important on Metis, but it's still a factor. Whenever L1 gas spikes, so does L2, and that's when the competitive factor increases even more.\n\n**4. IL Reduction**\n\nAn issue as old as DEXes itself: IL. Many retail users are wary of providing liquidity because of the high IL they incurr on traditional solutions. Solidly employs a variable & automatic pool fee mechanism, which frontruns toxic CEX flow before it arrives on-chain. This leads to higher fees for LPs and reduced IL due to toxic flow. In a showcase in October it provably demonstrated on-chain to even front-run veteran MEV bots.\n\n## Uniqueness factor\n\nUnique features of Solidly:\n\n1. **Lowest gas CLAMM DEX** in the world, proven on-chain and via various test suites.\n\n \n![2.jpeg](ipfs://bafybeicjtnpkfkyvbkohdomqgatov2nrxwrmizbygonlqung2ezx2iotnq)\n    \n\n2. **The Solidly Flywheel**\nSolidly emits $SOLID token on a weekly basis according to the pools that veSOLID lockers voted for. Currently this amounts to over $240k USD per week in incentives. Voters earn 20% of fees from the pools they vote for, thus they're incentivized to vote for pools which provide them the highest returns. This in turn allocates SOLID emissions to these hyper-efficient pools, which then in turn again deepen their liquidity, leading to a positive filtering of high-value pools.\n\n3. **Solidly bribing mechanism**\nProtocols that are looking to create or deepen liquidity of their token pairs can do so by either attaching liquidity incentives to their pools directly, or alternatively by bribing voters to vote for their pool(s). Multiplier effects possible.\n\n4. **Merkle Rewarder**\nSolidly has created its in-house solution for distributing all reward types (LP fees, LP emissions, LP bribes, Voter bribes, Voter fees). This gives Solidly the unique value proposition of being able to incentivize custom liquidity ranges among filtering out predatory JIT attacks.\n\n6. **SolidSync Omnichain Bridge**\nSolidly has recently unveiled its in-house crosschain messaging aggregator. It uses a x of y of z secure signature setup, which accompanies all of its chain deployments. Solidly has recently launched its first deployment using the SolidSync bridge on Fantom, it became the #2 DEX by volume within 40 hours, outcompeting year-long solutions due to high efficiency deltas.\n**SolidSync was granted early mainnet access by Chainlink and it's used in a 2/3 setup with CCIP, LayerZero and Axelar.** Find out more about SolidSync in this X thread: https://twitter.com/SolidlyLabs/status/1738609337738662269\n\n7. **Perpetuals**\nThrough its exclusive and strategic stake in SYMMIO, Solidly will offer cutting-edge intent-based perpetuals trading. Deployment is expected to happen in Q1 2024. More info [here](https://www.symm.io/).\n\n## Value Proposition\n\nSolidly provides a cutting edge platform for high-efficiency liquidity provision. The Solidly flywheel ensures that emissions and incentives get allocated in the most effective way and to ensure deep liquidity in the healthiest and most volume-generating trading pairs. Furthermore it enables protocols to deepen the liquidity of their pools in a highly efficient and automated way with a friendly UX, allowing for multi-week and future-dated incentives, [something which Lido Finance is currently actively using on Ethereum mainnet](https://twitter.com/SolidlyLabs/status/1742628525360681232). Through its strategic partnership with Symmetrial, Solidly will enable intent-based perp trading on Metis for the most cutting-edge on-chain perp experience.\n\n## Benefits for Users\n\nSolidly will enrich the Metis community and ecosystem with its innovative solutions and friendly UX. It's not just another copy-paste fork, it's a truly unique protocol which has been building through all the bear and has seen astronomic growth in the past weeks.\n\n![3.png](ipfs://bafkreih6josafmeipi4tdzdsci3ovga2d5a7wds3hlyv4dlgpqpchx2zhq)\n\n## Roadmap\n\nJan 2024 - Deployment Solidly CLAMM DEX & SolidSync omnichain crosschain message aggregator\n\nMar 2024 - Deployment Perp Engine\n\n## Audits\n\nSolidly has been triple audited and will start its 4th audit with [Cyfrin next Monday](https://twitter.com/SolidlyLabs/status/1742261026819637663) (Jan 8th 2024).\n\nFind all past audits here:\n\nhttps://github.com/SolidlyLabs/Solidly-Audits/tree/main/Solidly%20V3\n\n## Summary\n\nSolidly proposes to deploy the Solidly CLAMM DEX, SolidSync omnichain messaging aggregator and Solidly Perp engine to Metis.\n\n## Official Links\n\nWebsite https://solidly.com\n\nTwitter https://twitter.com/SolidlyLabs\n\nGitHub https://github.com/SolidlyLabs\n\nDocs https://docs.solidly.com",

      "title": "Metis CEG Program: WAGMI",
      "content": "![Wagami Logo.png](ipfs://bafybeief4f36tnoyvkl5cd4cmsxlncvcfgkh3tfixyteg4a2xdemkjor6a)\n    ## Introduction\n\nThe **WAGMI** protocol is a limited TVL decentralised exchange with advanced liquidity provision strategies and GMI mechanics. Here is what we focus on:\n\n#### 1. Concentrated Liquidity utilization\n\nThe **WAGMI** Protocol incorporates the concept of concentrated liquidity. **WAGMI** employs advanced strategies for liquidity provision to optimize returns for users. Unlike earlier versions where liquidity was distributed uniformly across the price curve, concentrated liquidity enables liquidity providers (LPs) to allocate their capital within custom price ranges. This results in more efficient use of capital and greater fee earnings for LPs, as well as deeper liquidity for traders around the mid-price.\n\n#### 2. Active Liquidity Management\n\n**WAGMI** continuously monitors market conditions and employs an auto-rebalance mechanism to adjust strategy settings, aiming to ensure higher rewards at all times, irrespective of market shifts.\n\n#### 3. Interoperability\n\nBy leveraging the omni layer technology, the protocol can interact with multiple blockchain networks, ensuring compatibility with a wide range of DeFi applications and assets. This cross-chain functionality not only broadens the scope of the **WAGMI** protocol's services but also promotes a more inclusive and connected DeFi ecosystem.\n\n#### 4. Composability\n\nBy offering a wide range of financial services and tools under a single umbrella, the platform enables users to create and execute complex strategies with ease. This modular approach allows for the seamless integration of new DeFi products and services, fostering innovation and growth within the ecosystem.\n\n## Uniqueness factor\n\n### Unique features of WAGMI:\n\n**1. Advanced Liquidity Provision Strategies:** **WAGMI** employs advanced strategies for liquidity provision to optimize returns for users.\n\n**2. GMI Mechanics:** The protocol introduces a system where users can acquire GMI tokens and benefit from profits shared among GMI holders from multi-pools within a larger GMI pool.\n\n**3. Automated Management and Rebalancing:** **WAGMI** continuously monitors market conditions and employs an auto-rebalance mechanism to adjust strategy settings, aiming to ensure higher rewards at all times, irrespective of market shifts.\n\n**4. User-Friendly Liquidity Management:** Users don't need to manually select pools for higher yields as the protocol manages liquidity and selects price ranges in pools to maximize yields, alongside diversifying funds among different pools for security.\n\n**5. Multi-Pool Structure:** Within GMI, there are multiple multi-pools, and each multi-pool consists of multiple V3 pools, creating a nested structure of liquidity pools.\n\n**6. Cross-Blockchain Deployment:** The protocol was initially deployed on the Zksync Era mainnet, then on Fantom Opera, and Kava with enhanced features. Metis will be the first network to support both the **WAGMI** dApp and an extra Perps Trading platform.\n\n**7. Profit Sharing Among GMI Holders:** Profits generated from all multi-pools within GMI are shared among GMI holders according to their share of GMI, serving as a diversification tool and incentive for users.\n\n## Value Proposition\n\nThe **WAGMI** protocol is designed to maximize the utilization of liquidity under management, optimizing returns for liquidity providers. By employing advanced liquidity provision strategies and an auto-rebalancing mechanism, the protocol ensures that the funds are allocated in a way that they generate higher yields, regardless of market shifts. The sophisticated liquidity management, represented through its GMI mechanics, simplifies the process for users, who no longer need to manually ascertain which pool is currently more profitable. The protocol's multi-pool structure and cross-blockchain deployment enhance liquidity access and diversification, fostering a more rewarding and secure environment for users. Through such measures, the **WAGMI** protocol significantly benefits its users by making liquidity provision in a user-friendly endeavor.\n\nFurthermore, while **WAGMI** has already deployed on the Kava Network, Metis will be the first network to host the **WAGMI** dApp with an additional Perps Trading platform on it. Perps Trading is one of the biggest drivers of ecosystem growth in all of DeFi.\n\n#### Benefits for Users\n\nThe Metis community will gain a popular, battle-tested decentralised exchange with numerous opportunities for DeFi users.\n\nIn addition, having the option to trade $METIS (and other tokens) with leverage creates a new and exciting user experience.\n\n#### Roadmap\n\n* January 2024 - deployment of **WAGMI** DeFi suite on Metis (GMI, LP strategies and leverage included)\n\n#### Audit\n\nAll **WAGMI** components have been thoroughly checked by various audit companies:\n\nhttps://github.com/RealWagmi/wagmi-leverage/tree/main/audit\n\nhttps://wp.hacken.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Wagmi_SC-Audit-Report_21092023_SA-1594.pdf\n\nhttps://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-real-wagmi\n\nhttps://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-10-real-wagmi\n\n\n#### Summary\n\n**WAGMI** proposes to deploy its decentralised exchange and perps trading protocol on the Metis network, with live launch scheduled for as soon as both the **WAGMI** and Metis communities approve the respective governance proposals.\n\n## Official Links\n\n**Website** https://wagmi.com\n\n**X** [https://x.com/popsiclefinance](https://x.com/popsiclefinance?s=21&t=-fMUS-Nal-oXZ2lLPO0yjg)\n\n**GitHub** https://github.com/RealWagmi\n\n**Docs** https://docs.wagmi.com",

      "title": "Metis CEG Program: Vega Protocol - Provides consensus ecological for the Metis ecosystem",
      "content": "## Introduction:\nVega is the first ecological protocol bases on the Metis chain that combines tokens and inscriptions. It will build a creative and vibrant galaxy ecosystem with the backdrop of constellations, bringing forth new ecological opportunities for Metis.\n \n \n \n![c4cdecd1b77e76e522aeff12e57be560653dc0b3.png](ipfs://bafkreifu764hu7hgn4kwfmdbalmjkzyxak5pukmiqgc6wibv4dfa4vr3t4)\n    \n    \n    \n$Vega is an autonomous token on the Metis chain, designed as a meme token with a constellation theme to create a galaxy ecosystem. It is born for the Metis ecosystem, aiming to generate abundant liquidity and strengthen consensus growth for Metis.\n\n## What is Vega doing:\n\nVega is a project specifically focused on on-chain liquidity for Metis, with a dedicated focus on the entire project ecosystem. Its goal is to become the first ecosystem token on the Metis chain. Additionally, Vega is committed to providing market share and collaboration opportunities for various ecosystem projects.\n\n \n![fff1a6080161129067ddcd6a886b616f8d810121.jpeg](ipfs://bafybeiaun73b744qftykws3bitdlui22pnjhlsqvmpr44uxfzdhywj4j2e)\n    \n\n\n## Support for Metis:\n\nVega's main responsibility is to establish and promote collaboration and development among projects within the Metis ecosystem. We will focus on building bridges between various projects, providing more market liquidity and on-chain cooperation opportunities for the Metis ecosystem. By creating a collaborative framework among projects, Vega will offer more opportunities and resources to foster the prosperity and growth of the Metis ecosystem. Vega's social media channels are now live, and you can find our tasks, roadmap, and more details there.\n\n## For Metis:\n\nVega will introduce airdrop, snapshot, and burning mechanisms specifically tailored for Metis. Specifically:\n\n1. **Airdrop**: Vega will distribute tokens to specific Metis addresses through airdrops. This will provide Metis community members with opportunities to participate in the Vega project and incentivize them to hold and support the development of Vega tokens.\n\n2. **Snapshot**: Vega will take snapshots on the Metis chain, recording the addresses and balances of Metis holders at specific points in time. These snapshots will be used for airdrops, rewards, and other participation mechanisms, providing additional earnings and rights for Metis holders.\n\n3. **Burning**: Vega will repurchase and burn Metis tokens. This means that a portion of Vega tokens' supply will be repurchased and destroyed, reducing the circulating supply and increasing the scarcity and value of the tokens.\n\n4. **Points**: With the goal of supporting the development of the Metis ecosystem, Vega has implemented a task-driven points system. Users can earn points by completing tasks or inviting others, which can be exchanged for airdrops. We aim to collaborate with more on-chain ecosystem projects, creating more market opportunities through active participation. Points serve as important credentials for early adopters. Additionally, invitees can also earn points based on their activity level, with more invitations and interactions resulting in more points.\n\n \n![07c0cdbcbdbbd6aef3f843ed459f2df967eb65de.png](ipfs://bafkreierzgytopnhekmbyt6dj6raq4enzxr3ci5mnk6bjow7ehjojk67rm)\n    \n\n\n## Vega Inscription Protocol:\n\nVega has prepared a new inscription strategy, and a new inscription protocol is about to be launched. Airdrops, snapshots, and token holders are all within the scope of the inscription.\n\n \n![57499f8404c17c717c4e16b71b23bc02b83beee9.png](ipfs://bafkreiexnozzm2v62kwv3he2r3v5arr73a675okywrqquct6qtwsbve5za)\n    \n\n\nThe release of the inscription protocol will bring more market opportunities for Metis ecosystem projects.\n\n## Vega Vision:\n\nVega aims to provide Metis community members with more opportunities to participate and benefit through airdrops, snapshots, and burning mechanisms. Holding and engaging with Vega tokens will enable users to enjoy various rewards and benefits from the Metis ecosystem, thereby enhancing consensus growth and development.\n\n## **Vega** Objectives:\n\nThrough its efforts, Vega expects Metis to become a more vibrant and innovative ecosystem. Vega will bring transformation and opportunities to the entire ecosystem, driving comprehensive development of Metis. We look forward to collaborating with Metis to create a more prosperous blockchain ecosystem.\n\n**Twitter:** https://twitter.com/protocol_vega\n\n**Website**:https://www.vegaprotocol.top\n\n**Whitepaper:** https://vega-1.gitbook.io/vega-protocol/overview/vega",

      "title": "Metis CEG Program: League.Tech, SocialFi on Metis",
      "content": " \n![d214977cc91098cd95ad9e64ff669c8e9172127d.jpeg](ipfs://bafkreichqchta7f7aoinfrc63smufs4hujlx7nmvqeizx6rg2cmxesfjz4)\n    In the landscape of Web3 SocialFi platforms, the current challenge is the need for the user-friendly experience characteristic of popular Web2 social media platforms like X and Instagram. League.Tech sets out to not only bridge this gap but also address fundamental design flaws related to user retention, platform engagement, and incentives within the creator economy.\n\nOur innovative approach not only enhances user engagement and retention but also provides a novel solution to the prevalent issues faced by content creators and consumers in current Web2 economies. Simply put, content creators are incentivized to engage more deeply with their followers, while followers are rewarded for their loyalty to a creator. Fostering a symbiotic relationship wherein both content creators and followers can derive benefits within the League.Tech ecosystem.\n\nThis comprehensive solution marks a pivotal step towards enriching the creator economy by amalgamating the best features of Web2 user experiences with the potential of Web3.\n\n* Website: [League Tech](http://www.league.tech)\n* Social Media: [X/Twitter](https://twitter.com/LeagueTechSoFi)\n\nKey Features:\n\n* Tiered Access: Ensures inclusivity, a premium user experience, and an opportunity for rewards sharing.\n* Unique [key shorting](https://medium.com/bandprotocol/short-selling-without-counterparty-using-bonding-curve-c499e35c3dc2) Mechanism: Introduces a direct way to take a short position from the bonding curve without introducing counterparty risk, fees, thus resulting in expedited price discovery.\n* Dynamic Reputation Badge System ([Nuvo](http://www.nuvosphere.io)): Have fun with badges and avatars for completing specific tasks while simultaneously building trust and credibility within the ecosystem.\n* League Creation and Betting: Like-minded content creators come together to create “Leagues”, within these leagues users will compete with each other for rewards. May the best, win!\n\nValue Proposition:\n\nLeague.Tech aims to be the de-facto Metis SocialFi platform. By introducing an elegant Web2- esque social media experience within a Web3 SocialFi platform, League.Tech will not only be able to take significant marketshare within the DeFi native userbase, but will be able to expand very quickly to more traditional brands, markets, and users who are not currently users of blockchain platforms. The specific features of the dApp were designed to promote on chain activity and fee generation. League.Tech will directly infuse the Metis L2 chain with significant on chain transaction activity, generate substantial fees, and ultimately bring a strong foundational platform that will spur collaboration across the Metis ecosystem.\n\nLeague Tech Design & Functionality:\n\n \n![1.png](ipfs://bafybeidji5db55shcxhadegtc7un42as3ccdcgt6nwel7p53scycdjo6ii)\n![2.png](ipfs://bafybeigpqrdeqwmzmd7jhgdk6mg5ilkeeuytubhtaztdflkucmrp3jq5tq)\n\n \n![3.png](ipfs://bafkreid5qooyihhghfdozbic5mf2oh6vrdeel3md6o7d2ndecophhydrn4)\n    \n     \n![4.png](ipfs://bafkreicer5ojhuhsmnfoxvisniujp3ipym7mbgtnul7mxqxwtkjfojrlwm)\n    \n\nRoadmap:\n\n* Q4 2023 Seed Round\n* Q4 2023 MVP Launch\n* Q4 2023 GTM Phase 1\n\n* Q1 2024 League Creation\n* Q1 2024 zkREP Alpha\n\n* Q2 2024 Series A\n* Q2 2024 Perpetual Condition Rewards\n* Q2 2024 GTM Phase 2\n* Q2 2024 Business Onboarding\n\nIn Summary:\n\nLeague.Tech will disrupt the SocialFi space by bringing Web2 social media’s ease of use and design to Web3. Current platforms such as Friend.Tech and Stars Arena lack more in-depth ways for content creators to engage with their users. Without a key shorting mechanism there is no way for proper price discovery to occur, preventing new users without significant means from participating. While the competition may be successful within the realm of crypto native users, they lack the reputation credibility system that scales beyond speculative crypto trading. Users of traditional social media have come to rely on such systems (trust scores and account verification, among others) as a way to grow their follower base and feel comfortable promoting the platform to others.\n\nPitch Deck:\n\nhttps://docsend.com/view/bppfmkhawc47bqn7\n\nAudit:\n\n[Quantstamp](https://quantstamp.com/) is currently auditing our core blockchain contracts.",

      "content": "![41cf768fc9feae7f4c58234e05d20b2a729d53bd.png](ipfs://bafybeieqa3c42end2z2e65zsfio4gxvmtodreou3cox7jv4fbx6pqjtppm)\n    ## About Us\n\nWe are thrilled to announce the upcoming launch of *Midas* — an exciting new gaming suite built on the [Metis blockchain](https://www.metis.io/)!\n\n*Midas* offers a variety of on-chain prediction market games, starting with an exciting new lottery game. The *Midas Lottery* will allow users to buy tickets with $METIS tokens for a chance to win $METIS prize pools.\n\n## Benefits to Metis\n\nOur goal is to advance blockchain (“on-chain”) gaming by demonstrating how Metis’ scalability and low transaction fees can enable the next evolution of fun and fair prediction games.\n\n## Benefits to Users\n\nAs a community-driven platform, *Midas* aims to showcase the capabilities of the high performance Metis network by integrating games with features and benefits below.\n\n**1. $METIS Prizes**\n\nAll Midas games offer the chance for users to win rewards in $METIS tokens. Match enough numbers on our lottery to take home exciting prizes! As Midas grows, our prize pools and jackpot sizes will continue expanding.\n\n**2. Fairness You Can Trust**\n\nMidas integrates provably fair random number generation powered by API3's QRNG technology. This creates full transparency around gameplay outcomes. Players can verify game integrity on-chain.\n\n**3. Fast and Responsive Gameplay**\n\nBy building on Metis, Midas games achieve lightning fast speeds with reliable transaction finality. No more lag or costly gas fees getting in the way of non-stop entertainment.\n\n**4. Community-Driven Platform**\n\nWe also plan to incorporate community feedback into our open product roadmap over time. This will allow Midas users to help shape future developments and new games they want to see on the platform. Be part of the journey!\n\n## Technical Specifications\n\nAs a direct fork of the well-established PancakeSwap Lottery, Midas Lottery inherits a strong foundation, further enhanced by the integration of API3's QRNG technology.\n\n**1. Forking PancakeSwap Lottery**\n\nMidas lottery is a clean fork of the PancakeSwap Lottery, a trusted and proven blockchain-based lottery system. This means that the core functionalities, security protocols, and architectural framework of Midas Lottery are directly replicated from PancakeSwap's system.\n\n**2. Integration of Quantum Random Number Generation (QRNG)**\n\nThe primary modification in this fork involves the replacement of the Chainlink VRF (Verifiable Random Function) with a API3's QRNG, tailored to operate seamlessly on the Metis blockchain. This alteration ensures compatibility and optimal performance within the Metis ecosystem, aligning with its unique capabilities and requirements.\n\n**3. Security and Audit Credentials**\n\nWhile Midas Lottery itself has not undergone a separate audit, it benefits significantly from the robust security measures established by its predecessor, PancakeSwap Lottery.\n\nPancakeSwap's lottery system has been subjected to comprehensive audits conducted by industry-leading security firms, PeckShield and SlowMist. The audit reports can be reviewed at the following links:\n\n* [PeckShield Audit Report on PancakeSwap Lottery](https://github.com/peckshield/publications/blob/master/audit_reports/PeckShield-Audit-Report-PancakeswapLottery-v1.0.pdf)\n* [SlowMist Audit Report on PancakeSwap Lottery](https://github.com/slowmist/Knowledge-Base/blob/master/open-report/Smart%20Contract%20Security%20Audit%20Report%20-%20PancakeSwap%20Lottery.pdf)\n\nThese audits provide an in-depth evaluation of the system's security, smart contract integrity, and overall reliability. \n\n## Roadmap\n\nPost-launch of the Midas Lottery, our roadmap focuses on broadening the gaming experience, introducing new player rewards, and empowering community involvement.\n\n**1. Introduction of New Games**\n\nWe are excited to expand our game portfolio with at least four additional games. Each game will uphold our commitment to provable fairness and on-chain gaming.\n\n**2. Staking Program with Shared House Fees**\n\nOur upcoming staking program will enable community members to earn from the platform's earnings, creating a meaningful stakeholder experience and fostering a deeper connection with the platform.\n\n**3. Launch of a Referral Program**\n\nTo expand our community, we will introduce a referral program. This initiative will reward affiliates, accelerating our user base growth and enhancing community engagement.\n\n**4. Development of Community-Driven Governance Tools**\n\nWe are committed to decentralizing decision-making by developing governance tools. This will allow our community to directly influence the platform’s direction, reflecting a user-centric approach.\n\n## Preview\n \n \n![Midasimg1.png](ipfs://bafkreiaqdfautsvxcye5xajt5w2iogmxzbqav3jmzbigaexohhsu6eqfte)\n    \n    \n![Midasimg2.png](ipfs://bafybeicv3lp42dkb5uoobybq27sfmsouur2cxgu3eb5b43mhidr52iatnm)\n    \n\n\n> Our vision — bringing on-chain gaming to the Metis ecosystem where transactions are fast, fees are cheap, and the community is vibrant.\n\n## Contact Us\n\nFor inquiries, partnerships, and collaborations, please contact us at info@midas.game.\n\n[Website](https://www.midas.game/) | [Twitter](https://twitter.com/midas_games) | [Medium](https://medium.com/@midasgames)",

      "content": "# AraFi - The Metagovernance protocol\n\n\n![9a77e9813cbd81973ac44d43552c2e3f25f6c049.jpeg](ipfs://QmQe6SHVFoCGwMJcN1WoDAM66c4F5zg7mmUcJjYUkeCZvK)\n    \n\n## **`Introduction:`**\n\nAfter close to two years of engaging with the Metis community and collaborating with numerous exceptional individuals and teams, the team at AraFi is thrilled to formally express our desire to become an integral part of this dynamic community. You may be more familiar with us under our previous name, Aerarium. However, as of December 7th, we have undergone a rebranding and are now known as AraFi. This change marks a significant milestone in our journey, and we look forward to contributing more meaningfully to this vibrant community.\n\nAraFi, an innovative meta-protocol, is aiming to transform DeFi on Metis by maximizing returns and streamlining governance for stakeholders. As an Omni-Chain governance aggregator, it addresses issues related to fragmented liquidity and complexity of multiple DeFi protocols. AraFi, operating within the Metis ecosystem, is paving the way for a more cohesive DeFi environment by streamlining yield and enhancing governance processes.\n\n\n- Website: [Arafi.app](https://beta.arafi.app/)\n- Social Media: [Twitter](https://twitter.com/AraFiEco)\n\n## **`Key Features:`**\n- Metis DeFi Wrapper Tokens (aAssets): AraFi's integration of these tokens enables seamless interactions and enhanced yield optimization across various DeFi platforms. These wrapped assets will be liquid enabling users access to some of the best yield on Metis.\n\n- Locked Governance through Snapshot: AraFi facilitates fair governance by allowing stakeholders who lock their tokens to actively participate in decision-making processes.\n\n## **`Value Proposition:`**\nAraFi aims to redefine the DeFi space by focusing on enhancing liquidity, promoting TVL growth, simplifying DeFi operations, and advancing DeFi adoption. AraFi's unique approach to enhancing liquidity and providing competitive yields through its boosted liquidity pools and Hermes gauge utilization promises significant growth to Metis’s TVL. By serving as a framework for DeFi protocols, it simplifies operations and encourages widespread adoption of DeFi solutions.\n\n## **`Functionality of AraFi:`**\nAraFi's key features include our wrapped assets (aAssets) and AraFi's Locked Governance Token (vlARA). Each of these contribute to optimizing yield, bolstering security, and promoting user engagement. By providing additional yield and farming opportunities, and a participatory governance model, AraFi creates a more dynamic and efficient DeFi ecosystem.\n\n## **`aAsset Sample Flow`**:\n\n \n![823df1a2b57a566d7fd9efb3f8b8ded3833f5f35.png](ipfs://QmRxzTS9BeCcfNyn33Vxs8bhWDeRQ7iaQAFKoLzRZWYQB2)\n    \n\n## **`Roadmap:`** \n \n- **`Q4 2023  Beta Launch`** - The initial release of our product features synthetic wrappers, aAssets, for two Metis ecosystem tokens: Hermes and Maia. In conjunction with this, we'll also soft launch the ARA governance system. The beta launch marks a significant step in our journey to build a fully functional and democratized DeFi ecosystem.\n\n- **`Q4 2023 Liquidity Expansion`** - Introduction of ARA/METIS trading pair alongside Hercules launch on Metis, enhancing community engagement and diversifying our treasury.\n\n- **`Q1 2024 Product alignment`** - Upgrading our product suite with bHermes boosted vaults, complementing Hermes' new features.\n\n- **`Q2 2024 Addition of Custom Gauge System`** - Implementing omni-chain custom gauges in our governance model with Ulysses, giving token holders more influence over ARA emissions.\n\n- **`Q2 2024 Inflation Control and Token Emission`** - Addressing economic sustainability by controlling inflation and reducing $ARA total supply to preserve value.\n\n- **`Q3 2024 FrontEnd Overhaul`** - Revamping the platform interface for improved navigation and aesthetics, simplifying DeFi interactions for a more accessible and rewarding user experience.\n\n## **`Conclusion:`**\nAraFi serves as a bridge between various DeFi protocols, enhancing efficiency, and encouraging active governance. It ensures continuous value growth and optimizes yield for stakeholders. Its strategic alignment within the Metis ecosystem amplifies its influence in the DeFi space. As AraFi continues to expand and collaborate, it is well-positioned to build with its innovative approach and strategic partnerships.\n\n## **`Whitepaper:`** https://docs.arafi.app/\n\n## **`Audit:`** \nFor our audit we have chosen [Blaize.Security](https://twitter.com/BlaizeSecurity). They provide smart contract auditing services and operate with the most up-to-date technologies to build a safe environment for blockchains and dApps. \nBlaize has over 5 years of experience working with different blockchain ecosystems and has successfully delivered more than 145 crypto projects.\n\nFind the audit report here: [Blaize Audit Report](https://github.com/AraFiEco/mediapack/blob/main/audit/Blaize_AuditReport_Sep2023.pdf)\nBlaize Website: https://blaize.tech/security/",

      "title": "Metis CEG Program: Steer Protocol",
      "content": "## Introduction\n\nSteer is a **decentralized computing protocol** built with the goal of addressing the challenges of infrastructure and data in building, securing, and deploying web3 dApps including Automated Liquidity Management for Concentrated Liquidity (CL) pools and more.\n\nWith Steer Protocol, Metis community can -\n\n1. Build on-chain automation using **20+ programming languages.**\n2. **Connect them to secured data sources** off-chain or on-chain using the Steer data marketplace,\n3. **Execute on-chain** using Steer infrastructure.\n\nSteer Protocol Currently offers two solutions -  \n\n1. **Off-chain compute** platform that can be leveraged by protocols or devs to build web3 dApps including Automated Liquidity Management, Automating Loan Payments, Asset Management, Automated Governance, Automating Cross Chain Actions, Automatic Trading Strategies, Automating Protocol Operational Tasks like reward distribution, airdrops, and more. \n2. We have built **Active Automated Concentrated Liquidity Management** that uses Steer Protocol off-chain compute infra with a combination of **multi-position automated strategies in a non-custodial, permission-less open ecosystem to manage liquidity on Concentrated Liquidity pools**. Currently, Steer automated strategies are deployed on concentrated liquidity pools across 12 chains, 8 AMMs, and over 260+ CL pools including Maia Dao on the Metis chain.  \n    \n    Steer Protocol ALM (Active Liquidity management solution) stands out by combining the power of off-chain computing with multi-position automated strategies, all within a secure and deterministic multi-layer execution framework. This unique approach not only enhances investment returns but also prioritizes the security of all participants in the ecosystem.\n    \n\nThis proposal aims to achieve Community Verified Project (CVP) status, with the primary goal of facilitating builders and the broader Metis ecosystem community in rapidly and securely developing and utilizing products using Steer Infrastructure.\n\n### **Technicals On** Concentrated Liquidity ****(CL) & Steer Protocol ALM Solution\n\nConcentrated liquidity presents a host of challenges that DeFi platforms and liquidity providers must navigate adeptly. Properly managing liquidity pools is paramount, as imbalances can lead to inefficient trading and reduced capital efficiency. Additionally, mitigating impermanent loss (IL) is a crucial concern, as it can erode the value of assets within a pool. Implementing effective incentive programs to attract liquidity providers and ensure a vibrant ecosystem is another challenge, as striking the right balance between incentives and sustainability can be intricate. In essence, concentrated liquidity demands a delicate and strategic approach, encompassing smart pool management, IL mitigation strategies, and sustainable incentive structures to foster a thriving DeFi environment.\n\nSteer Protocol addresses all these issues via Smart Pools. When an automated active liquidity management strategy is added to concentrated liquidity pools it's called a smart pool. LP’s deposit into these smart pools and the underlying strategies manage liquidity based on the strategy, reinvest fees for auto compounding, spread the liquidity similar to the CEX order book for traders, and keep the liquidity in-range based on the current price of asset, creating a healthy environment for all stakeholder interacting with CL pool. \n\nOn top of it, the Steer Protocol provides detailed analytics for monitoring liquidity smart pool performance, allowing for informed decision-making. Moreover, Steer Protocol offers the flexibility to run incentive programs to attract liquidity through its in-house staking feature or via Angle Merkl reward integration.  \n\nUnder each smart pool, Steer Protocol uses an optimized position manager contract to mint and manage LP positions. An automated strategy paired with the vault runs off-chain to determine how much to rebalance and where to make positions on the pool. Funds are provided by liquidity providers, whose deposits are minted as ERC-20 LP tokens representative of their deposit. These strategies are publicly open and can be developed or published by anyone.\n\nHere is the link to our strategies - https://docs.steer.finance/concentrated-liquidity/official-apps/keltner-channels\n\nThe technical implementation of Steer's solution involves the following steps:\n\n1. The LP’s deposits the base assets into a smart pool.\n2. Steer's smart vaults deploy the assets to the AMM v3 pool.\n3. The depositor has minted ERC-20 LP tokens representative of its deposits.\n4. Steer's off-chain computations monitor market conditions and rebalance & mint positions to ensure maximum depth and fees.\n5. The LP tokens can be redeemed for the deposited base assets at any time.\n\n### Distinguishing Factors from Other Liquidity Managers:\n\n- **Multi-position Strategies With Secured Off-chain Compute -** Unlike rival protocols that limit users to just 2-3 positions, Steer Protocol masterfully manages an extensive array of positions simultaneously for ALM at a low gas cost due to off-chain compute. **The resulting benefits will positively impact all stakeholders, as traders get lower slippage, liquidity providers can earn higher fee returns, and AMM can benefit from increased trading volume.**\n- **Minimize or outperform IL**: Steer Protocol ALM is able to keep the value of the deposit close to that of holding the initial assets, and often outperform it.\n- **Trustless & transparency**: Steer Protocol ALM only autonomously manages the liquidity but can never remove it. All executions of Steer Protocol ALM can be monitored on-chain with full transparency.\n- **Open Ecosystem**: Steer Protocol provides LPs an option to create/deploy automated strategies on any concentrated liquidity pools via Steer SDK, so LPs don't have to wait for an ALM to add those pools. Be your own market maker.\n- **Advanced Analytics**: Steer Protocol offers a wealth of insightful analytics that delve into the performance of automated strategies within Concentrated Liquidity (CL) pools. So that any analysis of the risks and rewards.\n- **Secured Execution:** Steer Protocol uses off-chain computing that relies on deterministic execution by all nodes and consensus to do any on-chain execution of strategies. On top of it, each smart vault has other security parameters added as well like Twap, slippage, max supply, and other checks.\n\n## Alignment with Metis\n\nSteer Protocol's off-chain computing capabilities present a valuable resource for the Metis ecosystem, offering numerous potential use cases beyond its existing functionalities. An illustrative example is automated active concentrated liquidity management, showcasing just one facet of the myriad possibilities.\n\nOur current collaboration with Maia DAO has enabled us to support active Concentrated Liquidity (CL) management on the Metis chain, specifically within their Uni V3-style pools. We are now poised to expand our offerings, inviting the Metis community to leverage our compute platform for the creation of innovative products that can further enrich the Metis ecosystem.\n\nThe growth of liquidity-related activities, encompassing traders, liquidity providers, and automated market makers (AMMs), along with the broader Metis ecosystem and the protocols built upon it, has been progressing at a relatively modest pace. We hold a strong conviction that the Steer Protocol can serve as a catalyst, igniting the development and adoption of a diverse range of products within this ecosystem.\n\n## **Audit:**\n\nSteer Protocol has been rigorously audited by Omniscia and Zellic on Feb 10, 2023 and May 2, 2023 respectively.\n\nYou can find the audit reports here:\n\nZellic: https://steer.finance/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/FILE_2279.pdf\n\nOmniscia: https://omniscia.io/reports/steer-protocol-core-implementation-636b8fca6693a100164bf02f/\n\n## Steer Team\n\nOur global team has a proven competence in building and scaling products as well as companies in both web2 and web3 space with an average of 10-14 years of experience. Our executive team has previously worked together for 6+ years and has scaled various startups in the blockchain space from the ground up. Our overall team has strong product, business, operation, and marketing backgrounds with a lot of trusted execution between each other. \n\n## Reference\n\nFor more information regarding Steer Protocol and Steer Protocol ALM, feel free to\nlook at our docs and join our community.

      "title": "Special Proposal to Metis Community: Migrate Data Availability to Ethereum Mainnet",
      "content": " \n![Data Availibility 4.jpg](ipfs://bafybeiahrd5dwirb4qga2ymyr6grjksxmn2qveslwyhctixuukmior5eve)\n    ## Author: Metis\n\n## Date: 2023-09-27\n\n---\n\n## Summary\n\nMetis proposes to change the method it uses to process transactions from Layer 1 Ethereum – from an off-chain storage layer to convert to its original traditional Optimistic Rollup format.\n\n## Motivation\n\nIn the spring of 2022, Metis partnered with a project called Memo Labs to create an off-chain storage layer. This storage layer has enabled Metis to avoid having to push all data to Layer 1 Ethereum; fewer data pushed to Ethereum has led to lower cost to transact on the Metis Layer 2 network.\n\nMigrating to an Optimistic Rollup architecture will simplify the launch of a breakthrough venture: the Metis sequencer pool. Pushing all transactions to Ethereum streamlines the entire process, which would make it easier for Metis developers to launch this sequencer pool.\n\nAn important function of Optimistic Rollups is a concept known as data availability. Data availability ensures that the network’s transaction data are available to be reconstructed by validators and users at any time. This is typically done by batching transaction data to Layer 1.\n\nRelying on a third party such as Memo Labs can have an adverse impact on data availability, as not all transaction data are published to Layer 1 – only the location of the data stored in Memo Labs. Migrating to Metis’ original Optimistic Rollup format would mark a heightened commitment to data availability, and to Ethereum’s ethos, while still enabling transaction fees that are in line with other Layer 2 networks, and much less expensive than on Layer 1 Ethereum.\n\n## Metis Sequencer Pool\n\nMetis will soon become the first Layer 2 network to decentralize its sequencer by launching a first-of-its-kind sequencer pool. Opening up sequencer duties to many independent parties would eliminate the single-point-of-failure risk that a single sequencer entails.\n\nBy decentralizing sequencer duties across a much broader network, Metis will move beyond the industry standard of relying on a single sequencer entity, ensuring continuity of operations, robust network performance, and enhanced security. It will propel Metis closer to achieving the three challenges of what Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin called the [Blockchain Trilemma](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/blockchain-trilemma): decentralization, security, and scalability.\n\nThe sequencer pool will also bring new opportunities to Metis users. It will enable single-staking opportunities for METIS previously unavailable on our Layer 2 network; to become eligible to be a sequencer, interested parties will need to stake METIS.\n\nTo make that sequencer pool and the opportunities that it will bring possible requires high levels of data availability and simplicity – higher than what is currently available under the existing off-chain storage layer model. Migrating to the Optimistic Rollup model would address both of those challenges.\n\n## Community Implications\n\nThis move does come with a drawback: transaction fees would go from being [lower than on any other Layer 2 network](https://l2fees.info/) thanks to the Metis Smart Layer 2 approach, to being in line with other L2s. The Metis community could, at a later date, propose that Metis return to its Smart L2 approach after we launch and successfully roll out the sequencer pool. Note that for any such move to be considered, additional steps would need to be implemented to ensure [optimal levels of data availability and security](https://docs.metis.io/dev/protocol-in-detail/metis-l2-explained#how-do-you-deal-with-the-data-availability-problem-speaker-listener-dilemma).\n\nThe need to retain Optimistic Rollup architecture would drop once the sequencer pool is up and running, since the initial challenges of (primarily) simplicity and (secondarily) data availability required would have already passed. If Metis switches to Optimistic Rollup architecture and then retains that format, ​​the[ call data](https://betterprogramming.pub/solidity-tutorial-all-about-calldata-aebbe998a5fc?gi=b80a5c0190b4#:~:text=The%20calldata%20is%20a%20data,is%20always%2032%20bytes%20long.) pushed to Memo Labs in the past would require an extra step to access. This would not impact on-chain transaction verification, user experience, or the smooth operation of the network.\n\nHowever, a blockchain is typically designed to make records of all data easily accessible to anyone who wants to go back and review any network activity. The community could ask Metis to provide a snapshot enabling easier access to all historical call data, complete with timestamps and other key details. Then after Ethereum migrates to [EIP-4844](https://www.eip4844.com/), the community could propose that Metis evaluate the developer time and cost required to upload historical call data from Memo Labs to Ethereum, and decide how to proceed from there.\n\nFor now, though, the proposal before the community is a simple YES or NO (or ABSTAIN) on Metis migrating to Optimistic Rollup format to support full data availability.\n\n## Main Advantages for converting to Optimistic Rollup format\n\n– Removes a layer of complexity in Metis architecture, thus facilitating the successful launch of the sequencer pool.\n\n– Enables full data availability, which would help the launch of the sequencer pool.\n\n– Sequencer pool will enable Metis to stop relying on a single entity to handle sequencer duties for the entire network, enabling more decentralization and security upgrades.\n\n– Sequencer pool will enable single-staking opportunities for METIS not currently available in the ecosystem.\n\n## Main Disadvantage for converting to Optimistic Rollup format\n\n– Would move transaction costs from lowest among all Layer 2 networks to in line with other L2s, pending a possible switch back to Smart L2 format once the sequencer pool is operational.\n\n## Next Steps\n\n1. Gather community feedback on this proposal.\n2. Once consensus is reached, move this proposal to the Snapshot stage for a community vote.\n3. If the Snapshot outcome is 51% YES, implement the proposed changes to Metis’s Data Availability, migrating it back to Ethereum Mainnet",

      "title": "Metis CEG Program: CVP Vote: Gamma",
      "content": "Welcome to another episode of our great CEG program. Aiming in giving the community the power to vote on Metis partnerships, we are pleased to present to the community an awesome Project and a candidate of this episode's VCP;\n\n### Introduction\nGamma is a protocol for non-custodial, automated, and active management of concentrated liquidity. Gamma currently supports fourteen blockchains and twelve decentralized exchanges. The protocol manages approximately $75m in TVL and over 300 pairs that utilize various automated strategies and incentive programs. \n![image.png](ipfs://bafybeieajmz5mhvj54kr5ovvw677hqnoktagohvwhewdadn22ozym3ves4)\nWith this Community Verified Project (CVP) application, we hope to take the first step in participating in the Metis ecosystem.\n\n### Tech Utility\nGamma is known as a Concentrated Liquidity Manager (CLM) or Concentrated Liquidity Market Maker (CLMM). This is a class of protocols that are designed to deal with the unique challenges posed by concentrated liquidity. These challenges include managing liquidity pools correctly, mitigating impermanent loss (IL), deploying incentive programs, and more.\n\nGamma’s key feature is the vault. Gamma’s vaults allow users to deposit liquidity into supported liquidity pools in a non-custodial manner and utilize proper strategies. These strategies optimize performance by maximizing fee production, minimizing impermanent loss, and creating optimum liquidity conditions for the supported pool and traders using those pools. Vault performance is viewable on our analytics suite. Gamma also supports several in-house and 3rd party platforms for protocols to reward incentives to liquidity providers, including our own “GammaChef” rewarder platform and Angle Merkl. Finally, Gamma offers protocol liquidity and treasury management services to various projects. \n![87f.png](ipfs://bafybeieixtd3poybs74ususfcmez227vw7rsmgas7sf7o7gos7bg7de7te)\n     \n![9dbf0b.png](ipfs://bafybeihykyfwyz4lx452qlwvcscn42qx72ykvpynfmygbiimd75kwhvere)\n\nThese applications are all critical to the health of the Metis ecosystem by creating stable and efficient channels for liquidity to flow into the ecosystem.\n\n### About Us\nGamma is a global team developing concentrated liquidity solutions since its creation. Gamma has collaborated with various AMMs and blockchains to supply backend liquidity management services and support. The team comprises business development, strategy, frontend, backend, data analytics, marketing, social media, documentation, and community management.\n\n### Security\nWe have been through three significant audits by ConsenSys Diligence, Arbitrary Execution, and Certik. All major issues have been mitigated and resolved. We have several other security measures, including active monitoring, TWAP checks, deposit caps, and routine stress testing.\n[Audit links](https://docs.gamma.xyz/gamma/learn/audits)\n[Contracts](https://docs.gamma.xyz/gamma/learn/scans)\n\n### Uniqueness Factor\nGamma will be the first to bring concentrated liquidity management to Metis. Our cross-chain and AMM model experience allows us to integrate and assist projects on Metis efficiently. Gamma has extensive experience in the liquidity sector and has created a sustainable funding path to support the project indefinitely.\n\n### Alignment with Metis\nConcentrated liquidity has proven to be significantly more capital-efficient than older liquidity models. By bringing concentrated liquidity management to Metis, we are leveling the playing field with other blockchains and providing the Metis ecosystem with critical infrastructure. Gamma benefits by gaining more experience with another innovative blockchain and opening up a whole ecosystem of potential partnerships.\n\n### Current Deployment Status\nGamma has begun building infrastructure to deploy on Metis. Gamma is currently in discussions with projects that support concentrated liquidity on the Metis blockchain. Gamma has begun deploying backend and frontend infrastructure with Metis, and any contract deployment will be added to this section as added.\n\n### Integration Roadmap\n- September 2023: Setting up critical Metis infrastructure\n- October 2023: Deployment of backend and support for a concentrated liquidity AMM\n- November 2023: Frontend support on Gamma.xyz with analytics\n\n### Thank you for your consideration!",

      "title": "Metis CEG Program: CVP Vote: Algebra Protocol Integration for HerculesDEX on Metis",
      "content": "Welcome to another episode of our great CEG program. Aiming in giving the community the power to vote on Metis partnerships, we are pleased to present to the community an awesome Project and a candidate of this episode's VCP;\n\n### Introduction\nWe present a proposal for the integration of Algebra Protocol, a prominent player in concentrated liquidity, with Hercules DEX on the Metis blockchain. Algebra’s expertise and innovative technology will enrich the upcoming Hercules DEX ecosystem. With a track record of over 2 years in providing concentrated liquidity solutions and partnerships with DEXes (20 in total) like Quickswap, THENA, and Camelot, Algebra brings a wealth of experience to this collaboration.\n\n### Rationale for Collaboration\nThe partnership between Algebra and Hercules DEX is a strategic move. Leveraging Algebra’s experience in integrating with Camelot—a foundational component of Hercules DEX—and its adeptness in concentrated liquidity, this collaboration is poised to enhance Hercules DEX’s functionality. Algebra’s unique implementation of redirectional fees will be integral to Hercules DEX’s architecture, elevating user experience and liquidity provision.\n\n### Algebra’s Unique Features\nAlgebra Protocol has innovatively evolved the concept of concentrated liquidity initially introduced by Uniswap. The Algebra V1 version offers the following distinct features:\n- Dynamic Fees: Tackling the challenge of liquidity concentration, Algebra’s dynamic fee structure simplifies investment choices for liquidity providers. A single pool based on volatility and pool volume streamlines earnings, particularly during volatile market periods, mitigating impermanent loss concerns.\n- Built-in Farming: Algebra introduces built-in farming, allowing liquidity providers to not only earn rewards from farming but also gain fees from their liquidity positions, creating a dual revenue stream.\n\n\nIn addition, Algebra will bring an active liquidity manager like Gamma or an equivalent solution. This innovation ensures that positions in pools are actively managed, eliminating the need for users to manually adjust and replace liquidity. Alongside adaptive fees, which generate higher fees, this added feature enhances the overall efficiency of liquidity provision.\n\n### Transitioning to Algebra [Integral](https://medium.com/@crypto_algebra/algebra-integral-empowering-decentralized-exchanges-with-modular-architecture-199d7a540efe)\nWhile the initial phase involves powering Hercules DEX with Algebra V1, the collaboration is poised for evolution. Algebra’s next iteration, Algebra ‘Integral,’ aims to provide increased partner & user flexibility. This version functions as an engine for DEXes, striking the optimal balance between gas efficiency & functionality. Its modular architecture allows seamless integration & removal of specific modules, reducing the need for liquidity migration and decreasing the gas costs.\n\n### Introducing Plugins\nA pivotal feature of Algebra ‘Integral’ is its introduction of a customizable architecture via plugins. These plugins enable the alignment of protocol pools and individual pools with specific smart contracts. Utilizing hooks, plugins influence pool behavior before or after specific actions, enabling extension, enhancement, or modification of standard functionality.\n\n### Audits and Security\nAlgebra Protocol’s robustness is further fortified by comprehensive audits and real-market testing facilitated by its numerous DEX partnerships. The protocol’s security is validated by audits from reputable firms including ABDK, Hexens and MixBytes:\n- ABDK Audit: [Link](https://algebra.finance/static/ABDK_Algebra_Audit-b4a20379efce1d26b7fbe9127582df6a.pdf)\n- ABDK Audit v2: [Link](https://algebra.finance/static/ABDK_Algebra_Audit_v2-12e19519a284a6c99b72c0163d9166da.pdf)\n- Hexens Audit: [Link](https://algebra.finance/static/Hexens_Algebra_Audit-0918594cb7666296d9f57295d9274270.pdf)\n- Hacken Audit: [Link](https://algebra.finance/static/Hacken_Algebra_Audit-317911476f86c632be77388fa51852c0.pdf)\n- MixBytes Periphery Audit: [Link](https://algebra.finance/static/Mixbytes_Periphery_Audit-f14ebd5021ff66c1adcf9577a4fccdc5.pdf)\n- MixBytes Farmings Audit: [Link](https://algebra.finance/static/Mixbytes_Farmings_Audit-97042ebae64ce361a8b69e22f72dd70a.pdf)\n\n### Thank you for your consideration!",

      "title": "Metis CEG Program: CVP Proposal: Elk Finance",
      "content": "Welcome to another episode of our great CEG program. Aiming in giving the community the power to vote on Metis partnerships, we are pleased to present to the community an awesome Project and a candidate of this episode's VCP;\n\n\n### Introduction\nElk Finance, a pioneering force in the DeFi landscape, has created a secure custom bridging & cross-chain messaging solution that reduces fragmentation and enhances interoperability in the world of decentralized finance. With ElkNet, our flagship product, we provide a secure and efficient multi-chain operation platform for various blockchain projects on Metis. As we venture into the next phase of our journey, we are excited to announce our deployment on the Metis chain. Elk is live now on [Metis](https://app.elk.finance/swap/43114/AVAX/ELK), so go check it out!\n\n### Proposal Details\nBackground and Motivation: The future of DeFi is undeniably multi-chain. As numerous blockchains emerge, the challenge lies in transferring value and information seamlessly between them. Elk Finance’s ElkNet offers a transparent and secure bridging solution, eliminating custodial risks and reducing vulnerabilities. Our deployment on the Metis EVM chain is a strategic move to tap into the vast ecosystem of Metis, benefiting both our users and the Metis community.\n\n### Benefits for Metis Ecosystem:\n- Interoperability with ElkNet: Our cross-chain capabilities ensures seamless transfers between Metis and other supported chains. Not only this, but any project will be able to permissionlessly create a bridge to/from Metis to any other chains of their choice with our Bridge-as-a-Service infrastructure. This will attract other projects to Metis from our (currently) 27 other blockchains (and counting). Currently, users can bridge the ELK token from any of the other 27 ElkNet connected blockchains to Metis to participate in the ecosystem (and can even trade some ELK for gas automagically in case they are new to the chain).\n- Farms-as-a-Service (FaaS) We will launch our [audited](https://4126527139-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-MW_PNk7A0t0ux_cdlkt-887967055%2Fuploads%2FxBjhL7OeboLi4NgCfNZW%2FBiPole%20FaaS%20Audit.pdf?alt=media&token=767206ee-bec0-42f8-8dca-c5b669a6c855) Farms-as-a-Service contracts on chain so that any user/project can use our UI to create custom farms that can reward up to 15 different tokens from a single farm, no coding required (currently live on Avalanche, Polygon, Fantom, and BitTorrent Chain on the [ElkDEX](https://app.elk.finance/swap/43114/AVAX/ELK)\n- Increased Trading Volume: Elk Finance’s deployment promises additional liquidity on the Metis chain, enhancing the overall trading experience. This is incentivised by ELK token staking as well as a $METIS-$ELK farm, not to mention user created farms using FaaS. Elk will be deploying a Uniswap v3 DEX and UI within the next month or so, which will introduce greater functionality.\n- User Growth: The Metis community will gain exposure to Elk Finance’s robust user base, driving more users to Metis-based projects.\n\n\n### Why ElkNet?\n- Security - ElkNet is a safe method of moving value across blockchains. ElkNet minimizes common bridging risks (double spends, etc.) The system introduces optimistic delays and periodic verification of transfer messages to detect inconsistencies in the blockchain (e.g., reorganization) or suspicious activities, preventing further processing of such transfers.\n- Low Cost - ElkNet is efficiently gas optimized and requires only two on-chain transactions per cross-chain transfer, minimizing gas costs for users and operators.\n- Fast - ElkNet is as fast as the underlying blockchains it supports. In most cases, transactions go through in mere minutes. The transfer is completed after finality is confirmed on the source chain. The transfer speed between two chains is unaffected by other chains or congestion.\n- Compatibility - Its unique design allows ElkNet to be compatible with all blockchains, whether they are EVM or not. Our design would enable Metis to reap the benefits of any chain ElkNet is connected to, allowing the project to easily proxy its token on EVM and non-EVM blockchains. ElkNet also plays nice with other bridging solutions, and is very modular, so you don’t need to commit to just one bridging solution.\n- Unique Opportunities for Partnerships - Having a token present on multiple blockchains allows for unique partnerships with projects on a variety of chains, allowing more opportunities for business development and marketing.\n- Decentralized - ElkNet will be secured by a set of decentralized nodes that collectively verify messages and transfers and work together to post transactions on the target chain. The decentralized nature of the system also helps provide censorship-resistance and long-term viability.\n- Transparency - Using a reservoir system allows users/projects to follow transactions on and off-chain, and ensures a simple but adaptable mechanism for bridging. Transfers are easily executed by users where the only interaction is with ElkNet, the origin blockchain, and destination blockchain that the user is bridging between.\n- Customizability - Applications and bridges built on top of ElkNet can customize their bridging interface as they see fit. The liquidity for any proxy token can be present on any decentralized exchange (DEX), allowing the interface to direct the user wherever they like. Our Bridge-as-a-Service infrastructure will be completely permissionless, so no need to ask anyone before creating your bridge!\n- Unique Features - Features such as the “swap for gas” option, allow users to arrive on new chains with the ability to instantly interact with the chain’s ecosystem. Cross-chain messaging allows ElkNet to communicate with any blockchain it is connected to. ElkNet is the hub of the ecosystem and ensures that transfers from/to all chains are handled without issue.\n- Minimal Maintenance - Since the ElkNet is becoming an independent network operated by decentralized nodes, developers building on top of ElkNet need not maintain their own nodes. Similarly, ElkNet supports easy cross-chain price arbitrage, allowing prices to stay consistent on all blockchains. Using ElkNet for arbitrage represents another potential opportunity for Metis to capture profit.\n\n### Grant Utilization:\nThe $5K USD grant will be allocated to make up a portion of our deployment costs. Elk has already spent funds launching our DEX on Metis, and would like to recoup a portion of our development costs through this grant. We believe that the functionality we bring to Metis will exponentially outweigh the initial cost of the grant.\n\n### Conclusion\nElk’s deployment on the Metis EVM chain marks a significant milestone in our journey. We are committed to delivering a seamless and secure experience for all users and are optimistic about the synergies this collaboration will bring. We humbly seek the support of the Metis community in this endeavor and look forward to a fruitful partnership.",

      "content": "Welcome to another episode of our great CEG program. Aiming in giving the community the power to vote on Metis partnerships, we are pleased to present to the community an awesome Project and a candidate of this episode's VCP;\n\n### Wanchain: We Are All Connected\n\n[Wanchain](https://www.wanchain.org/) is comprised of a sustainable Layer 1 EVM-compatible blockchain with monero-style privacy features and a network of decentralised blockchain bridges connecting more than 25 public networks, including both EVMs and non-EVM blockchains. Wanchain empowers developers to build truly decentralised cross-chain applications to power the future of Web3.\n\n### What problem is Wanchain solving?\n\nBlockchain technology represents a new paradigm, but too many blockchain networks are repeating the mistakes of the past. Each blockchain — or, in some cases, cluster of blockchains — exists as a siloed, isolated network.\n\nWanchain, along with our partners, is solving this problem by standardising one of the most important areas in blockchain: cross-chain communications. We are focused on enabling code and nodes on a blockchain to call code deployed on a different blockchain, and where appropriate, receive a response.\n\nToday, Wanchain provides developers the ability to transfer assets from one blockchain to another blockchain, the ability to send and receive messages across blockchains, and the ability to initiate actions across blockchains. These capabilities allow for more complex scenarios involving multiple blockchains.\n\nWanchain’s solutions work in the context of public Ethereum blockchains, consortium blockchains, optimistic rollups, zk rollups, non-Ethereum Virtual Machine blockchains and other blockchain-like systems.\n\n### What is Wanchain XFlows\nZero slippage native-to-native cross-chain transformations that are:\n- Fast\n- Cheap\n- Decentralised\n- Non-custodial\n- Permissionless \n\n\n![5ab30fda57862627cd0dd0306e6af6248e5e54c9_2_1035x582.jpeg](ipfs://bafybeiempf3xjd6cjl3tyr3wxb6hktktyjhekr4mc37rnswwzwll3hdk2a)\n\n### Planned XFlows Assets/Routes to support on Metis\nBTC\n- Bitcoin\n- Avalanche (as BTC.b)\n- BNB Chain (as BTCB)\n- Ethereum (as WBTC)\n- Metis (Metis bridge)\n- Wanchain (as wanBTC)\n\nETH\n- Ethereum\n- Arbitrum (Arbitrum bridge)\n- Metis (Metis bridge)\n- Optimism (Optimism bridge)\n- Polygon (Polygon bridge)\n- Wanchain (as wanETH)\n\nUSDC\n- Arbitrum (from Circle)\n- Avalanche (from Circle)\n- BNB Chain (as Binance-peg USDC)\n- Ethereum (from Circle)\n- Metis (Metis bridge)\n- Optimism (Optimism bridge)\n- Polygon (Polygon bridge)\n- Tron (from Circle)\n- Wanchain (as wanUSDC)\n\nUSDT\n- Arbitrum (Arbitrum bridge)\n- Astar (from Tether, via Polkadot as xcUSDT)\n- Avalanche (from Tether)\n- BNB Chain (as Binance-peg USDT)\n- Ethereum (from Tether)\n- Metis (Metis bridge)\n- OKX (from Tether/OKX)\n- Optimism (Optimism bridge)\n- Polygon (Polygon bridge)\n- Tron (from Tether)\n- Wanchain (as wanUSDT)\n\n### Tech Utility\nYou do not need to own/buy WAN tokens to use the platform. XFlows enables native-to-native cross-chain transformtions of BTC, ETH, USDT and USDC. For example, users will be able to move USDT from Arbitrum to Metis directly, without needing to pass through Ethereum.\n\n### Security\nWanchain uses a combination of secure multi-party computation (sMPC) and Shamir’s Secret Sharing to conduct the crosschain transactions. There’s also several other security layers, including:\n- Bridge nodes are permissionless\n- Bridge nodes are re-elected monthly\n- All bride nodes need to stake assets, which overcollateralise bridged assets (ie. if there is any hack or exploit, the bride nodes can be slashed to protect the end user)\n\nWanchain’s VP of Engineering, Dr. Weijia Zhang, is also the Head of China and Chair of the Interoperability workgroup at the [Enterprise Ethereum Alliance](https://entethalliance.org). We are co-authors of the EEA’s crosschain security guidelines, so Wanchain is the first place where these best-practices are implemented.\n\n### Uniqueness Factor\nNo other cross-chain solutions offers specific package of assets/routes.\n\n### Other important information\n- XFlows is already deployed on Testnet\n- XFlows is already deployed on numerous other EVM/non-EVM networks\n- Live product: [https://bridge.wanchain.org/](https://bridge.wanchain.org/)\n- Recent roadmap: [We Are All Connected: Wanchain 2023 and Beyond | Wanchain](https://medium.com/wanchain-foundation/we-are-all-connected-wanchain-2023-and-beyond-bebe9bc54c03)\n- Estimated Mainnet integration date: August 1, 2023",

Aiming in giving the community the power to vote on Metis partnerships, we are pleased to present to the community an awesome Project and a candidate of this episode's VCP;\n \n### Introduction \nOpenOcean is the most efficient DEX aggregator, a cross-chain swap aggregator, and Web 3 middleware developer in the crypto space, offering a suite of tools across 23+ networks and 300+ deep liquidity sources. OpenOcean is building a one-stop trading platform, to bring users the best swap return for decentralized crypto trading.\n\n### OpenOcean’s competitive edge on Metis\nOpenOcean empowers traders to execute efficient swaps at the best available swap rates by integrating the major liquidity sources in the Metis. OpenOcean also introduces its advanced smart routing algorithm and TradingView suite to Metis. Regardless of what you’re trading or the size of your trades, you’ll enjoy the same great benefits when swapping on the OpenOcean platform, including access to the best swap rates, highest capital efficiency, and a professional trading-overview with detailed charts and indicators.\n\nLet’s go through a showcase below trading on OpenOcean via the Metis. When traders try to swap 1,000 m.USDT/METIS, OpenOcean helps save $7 on the purchases compared to using a Dex directly. Even without direct Dex or pool support for the token pair, OpenOcean can still help traders to make swaps, such as m.USDT/MAIA. This example shows that OpenOcean can still help to find the best price across multiple-exchanges and save the end user time and money.\n\nBuild with OpenOcean on Metis — API & SDK are available\nOpenOcean offers a detailed and easy-to-use [API & SDK](https://docs.openocean.finance/dev/aggregator-api-and-sdk) for individuals or project builders to develop workflow price quotes, token swaps, transfers, and price tracking. Our docs have all the information you need to start building and help you with the integration process. Our tech team is always on hand and standing by to help with any integration-related issues through our [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/cxK6CCYcGp) support system or via Telegram.\n\nOpenOcean has succesfully launched  dex aggregation protocol on Metis Andromeda on June 12th, 2023. OpenOcean has successfully aggregated and indexed the deep liquidity sources on Metis, including Hummus, Netswap and Hermes. Through the aggregation, both Metis and OpenOcean users can obtain the most competitive swap rates available on Metis.\n\nLooking Forward for the Community's approval to become a CVP\n\nThank you for your consideration!",

      "content": "Welcome to another episode of our great CEG program. Aiming in giving the community the power to vote on Metis partnerships, we are pleased to present to the community an awesome Project and a candidate of this episode's VCP;  \n\n## Introduction\nHercules is a community-first next-generation DEX bringing customizable liquidity infrastructure to expand the Metis ecosystem. It aims to become the ecosystem hub by offering builders all the resources required to get started, bootstrap liquidity, and uphold their growth on the network.\n\nBuilt upon [Camelot’s](https://app.camelot.exchange/) ethos and leveraging its advanced tech stack, Hercules brings cutting-edge features that enable a high degree of flexibility for both users and builders.\n\n## Hercules’ Feature Set and Utility\nHercules is a feature-rich DEX allowing a multitude of real yield options to the community:\n1. clAMM abstraction: Simplified integration of concentrated liquidity (clAMM) into the DEX flywheel to increase its adoption and efficiency.\n2. dAMM: Dynamic AMM supports volatile pairs like UniV2 and also includes support for correlated assets such as stable pairs.\n3. Directional fees: Customize swap fees based on the direction (buying or selling) to optimize liquidity strategies for protocols.\n4. Liquidity position NFTs: Yield-bearing spNFTs add composability and enhance capital efficiency.\n5. Precise user’s profile: Protocols can benefit from Nitro pools to reward their most loyal and committed LPs by setting specific requirements.\n6. Customized launchpad: A custom-built platform offering several token launch strategies including fair-launch, referrals, discounts, airdrop, whitelist, etc.\n7. Swap referral: The platform offers a whitelisted referral system to share swap fees to partner-integrators.\n8. Dual-token design: Two tokens, TORCH and xTORCH, enable flexibility for vesting and DEX profit sharing in the form of USDC and ETH.\n9. Deflationary mechanisms: Integrated burn mechanism in xTORCH and TORCH buybacks ensure long-term growth and sustainability.\n10. Ownership stake: Protocol owned-liquidity (POL) gets a share of Hercules benefiting from reducing emission cost, increasing their treasury, or building new flywheels.\n\n## Hercules Unique Value Proposition\n- Community-first approach and real yield protocol: We prioritize the community by offering customized incentive structures aiming for sustainable tokenomics with a dual token model.\n- Flexible platform for builders: Our custom-built platform provides a high degree of flexibility for builders to launch their project, bootstrap liquidity and target specific user profiles through Nitro Pools.\n- Cutting-edge features and composability: HerculesDEX offers advanced features such as dAMM, clAMM, directional fees, liquidity position NFTs, customized launchpad, swap referral system, dual-token design, built-in deflationary mechanisms. These features enhance flexibility, capital efficiency, and incentivize participation.\n- Sustainable liquidity and ecosystem grants: The platform ensures long-term sustainable liquidity for the Metis network by offering extra layers of utility (aka, plugins) and grants to builders commitment to expand the Metis Andromeda network.\n\n## Hercules’ Roadmap\nHercules’ roadmap is built primarily to help the Metis ecosystem achieve deep on-chain liquidity:\n- Metis Ecosystem Genesis Pool (EGP)\n- Pre-launch Partners Announcement (Olympic Circle)\n- Hercules Genesis Pool (HGP)\n- xMetis Staking Infrastructure\n- Public Launch\n- Liquidity Provisioning and TGE\n- Hercules Grants\n\n## Audit Information\nHercules is built upon the Camelot battle-tested and audited codebase by Paladin, one of the most reputable firms in the business. The audit reports are available under this [link](https://docs.camelot.exchange/references/audits).\n\n## Security\nHercules adds an additional layer of security by adopting multisig (multi-signature) to avoid the problems often associated with centralized single-key wallets. This ensures that funds stored on a multi-signature address can only be accessed when two or more signatures are provided simultaneously.\n\n## Token Utility\nHercules is based on a dual-token framework with limited supply. The two tokens are a unique feature of the DEX and play the following roles:\n- TORCH is Hercules’s native emission token.\n- XTORCH, its counterpart, is a non-transferable escrowed governance token.\n\nBesides governance, users are able to allocate xTORCH to special contracts, called Plugins, to unlock extra utilities. The process consists of staking xTORCH into a central contract that will assign the deposited amount to a plugin chosen by the user.\n\nThis allows substantially greater composability, and to be able to integrate community or partners’ plugins while being able to leverage the allocated xTORCH with additional utilities (governance, airdrops, launchpad, yield booster…).\n\n## Conclusion\nOverall, HerculesDEX is poised to drive the Metis ecosystem forward by offering innovative solutions, fostering community engagement, and providing a robust and flexible platform that spearheads growth for projects and provides new opportunities for builders and users alike.\n\nThank you for your consideration!",

      "title": "Metis CEG Program: CVP Proposal: Furucombo",
      "content": "Yet another warming episode of our great CEG program. Aiming in giving the community the power to vote on Metis partnerships, we are pleased to present to the community an awesome Project and a candidate of this episode's VCP;\n\n## Introduction\nFurucombo is a multi-chain DeFi aggregator designed to simply, optimize, and automate DeFi trading for all users, new and advanced. Our product started as a tool built for endusers to create their DeFi strategies with drag-and-drop cubes, but has now evolved into a DeFi portal to help you optimize your crypto.\n\n## Feature Set and Utility\nWe will offer two main products on the Metis chain, create mode and our lending dashboard. Create mode is our drag-and-drop interface in which protocols and actions are represented by cubes. You can chain these cubes together to create complex transactions, or do many trading actions and execute them in one transaction.\n\n### Our create mode will launch with the following features:\n- Stargate (Token Bridge)\n- Aave (Deposit, Withdraw, Borrow, Repay, Flashloan)\n- Maia DAO (Swap Token)\n- Hummus Exchange (Swap Token)\n- Utility Features (Multi-send & Send Token)\n\n\nAdditionally, we will launch with our new feature, the Lending Dashboard. This allows users on Aave to manage their positions from our interface, and gain access to advanced strategies that wouldn’t otherwise be possible through utilizing flashloans.\nThe strategies available from the Lending Dashboard include:\n- Collateral Swaps (swap deposited assets without first repaying your debts, requiring no up-front funds)\n- Debt Swaps (swap borrowed assets without first repaying your debts, requiring no up-front funds)\n- Leverage (borrow funds from your collateral, and redeposit to increase leverage)\n- De-Leverage (withdraw your position without any upfront funds using your collateral to repay the debt and unlock the remaining principal)\n\n### For more background on our functionality, please see the following tutorials:\n- [Introduction to Create Mode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dhov_aEMbMw)\n- [Introduction to Flash Loans (Arbitrage)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_8dCe763fU)\n- [Advanced Flash Loans (Position Management)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2xmBBMTY7PE)\n- [Lending Dashboard](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ev7cDY7KZ4A)\n\n### Unique Value Proposition\nWe believe our unique product offers many benefits to users, new and old. Our protocol improves on ease of use as users can perform trades from just one interface, instead of having to jump to different protocols to perform their trading actions. It allows users to unlock the composability of DeFi through chaining transactions together. Through these chained actions it allows for more advanced trading actions using flashloans, which otherwise wouldn’t be possible without knowing how to code. Lastly, Furucombo is very active in the DeFi space, continually updating our product and expanding our horizons. We will continue to expand our development and any integrated chain and protocol will see added benefit.\n\n### Roadmap\nFurucombo continues to work hard at adding protocols and features that will add to the robustness and composability of every DeFi ecosystem. We will continue to work with the Metis team to ensure that our product is cutting edge, and will continue to deliver value to the users of Metis. If there is an integration you would like to see us add, please reach out to us on our Community Discord.\n\n### Audit Information & Contracts\nThe Furucombo proxy has been extensively audited and tested, and has been live since 2020 while receiving numerous upgrades. Our proxy contract can be closed at any time in the event of any malicious activity, and the Furucombo team is on call 24/7 in the event that the team needs to take action. The protocols that Furucombo integrate are based on blue chip protocols (or are forks of) and therefore pose very low risk (such as Uniswap, Aave, etc.) Our audit page can be found on our docs page via the link above.\nWe will also post a list of the contracts once we are live on Metis. We will also update them on our contracts page located on our docs page via the link above.\nFurthermore, as security is our most paramount concern, we also have an active bug bounty with ImmuneFi in which anyone can submit a bug report and make a claim if an exploit is found. You can find more information about our bug bounty on our docs page via the link above.\n\n### Conclusion\nWe are excited to be working with Metis and look forward to the support of the community. We hope that you see the value in what we are building, and can’t wait to bring these features live on chain for you all to use. We look forward to a long and prosperous partnership between our communities and protocols.\n\nThank you for your consideration!",

Aiming in giving the community the power to vote on Metis partnerships, we are pleased to present to the community an awesome Project and a candidate of this episode's VCP;\n\n*Abstract*\nMetisSafe is a multi-signature wallet that allows users to create and manage multiple wallets with different levels of security. It is a decentralized application that runs on the Metis blockchain.\n\n*Tech Utility*\nMetis Safe is an Ethereum-based smart contract wallet that needs a minimum number of persons to authorize a transaction before it can take place (M-of-N). If you have three primary stakeholders in your firm, for example, you may configure the wallet to need consent from all three persons before the transaction is sent. This ensures that no single person may jeopardize the funds.\n\n*Unique Value Proposition*\nMetis Safe is providing DAOs, DACs and users on Metis with a secure and easy to use multi-signature wallet.\nThe contracts and the wallet are open source and can be audited by anyone.\n150+ wallets are created, securing more than 25M$ in crypto assets.\nWe are developer friendly, providing a free and open-source API for developers to integrate MultiSig transactions via Metis Safe into their applications. trusted by DAC portal, Beefy Finance, and many others.\nMetis Safe won the first place for Web3 integrations in the Metis Ethereum Hackathon that took part in late 2021\n\n*Smart contract audits*\nThe MetisSafe smart contracts are a fork of the safe-global (previously GnosisSafe) and are available on GitHub and have been audited by G0 Group.\n\n*Smart contract links on Metis Andromeda*\nGnosisSafeL2: 0xfb1bffC9d739B8D520DaF37dF666da4C687191EA\nGnosisSafeProxyFactory: 0xC22834581EbC8527d974F8a1c97E1bEA4EF910BC\nCompatibilityFallbackHandler: 0x017062a1dE2FE6b99BE3d9d37841FeD19F573804\nCreateCall: 0xB19D6FFc2182150F8Eb585b79D4ABcd7C5640A9d\nGnosisSafe: 0x69f4D1788e39c87893C980c06EdF4b7f686e2938\nMultiSend: 0x998739BFdAAdde7C933B942a68053933098f9EDa\nMultiSendCallOnly: 0xA1dabEF33b3B82c7814B6D82A79e50F4AC44102B\nSignMessageLib: 0x98FFBBF51bb33A056B08ddf711f289936AafF717\nSimulateTxAccessor: 0x727a77a074D1E6c4530e814F89E618a3298FC044\nAlong with the wallets that are created by the factory, cloning the GnosisSafeL2 master contract.\n\n*Roadmap*\nQ1 2022:\nDeployment of the metis safe smart contracts on Metis Andromeda and Stardust\nDevelopment of the Metis Safe web wallet\nLaunch of the Metis Safe web Wallet\n\nQ2 2022:\nCommunity building\nIntegration of Metis Safe into other applications\n\nQ3 2022:\nUI and Backend improvements\nAdding safe apps support\nAdding support for the metis safe contracts on the gnosis safe backend codebase\n\nQ4 2022:\nLaunch of the Metis Safe on Metis Goerli Testnet\nPrice support for tokens on the metis network\nDeveloping better community outreach and support\n\nQ1 2023:\nUI and backend upgrades\nInfrastructure expansion\nMore safe apps per community requests\nIntegrating into Nuvo\n\nQ2 2023:\nTeam expansion and hiring\nAdding Spending Modules support\nDevelopment of the Metis Safe mobile wallet\n\nQ3 2023:\nMetis Safe mobile wallet launch\n\nQ4 2023 and later:\nCommunity proposals and voting\nOngoing development, integrations and support\n\nGrant MetisSafe CVP?

      "title": "Metis CEG Program: CVP Proposal: Athena Finance",
      "content": "Welcome to another exciting episode of our great CEG program. Aiming in giving the community the power to vote on Metis partnerships, we are pleased to present to the community an awesome Project and a candidate of this episode's VCP;\n\nAthena Finance is an innovative project developed by the experienced Vector Finance  team, aimed at revolutionizing the decentralized finance landscape on the METIS network. Our primary objective is to optimize DeFi yields on METIS by aggregating protocol tokens, beginning with the premier stableswap there: *the Hummus Exchange*. We are excited to bring our expertise and vision to the METIS ecosystem, enhancing its growth and expanding its ecosystem.\n\n*Athena Finance’s Feature Set and Utility*\nOur protocol provides a comprehensive suite of features that allows users to:\nConvert and stake protocol tokens like HUM for optimized yield generation\nDeposit assets on Athena to receive boosted yield from the underlying protocol\nParticipate in voting gauges using our native protocol token, ATH\nAutocompound pools for all staking pools on Athena, with third-party pools following after\nUtilize delegated voting pools for a seamless DeFi experience\n\n*Athena’s Unique Value Proposition*\nAt present, METIS lacks a dedicated aggregator protocol. Athena Finance aims to fill this gap by initially aggregating HUM and subsequently expanding to other protocols and DeFi strategies in the future. This strategic approach will ensure that Athena Finance stands out as a pioneering force within the METIS ecosystem.\n\n*Athena’s Roadmap*\nThe following milestones comprise Athena Finance’s roadmap for the next year and beyond:\n- Liquidity provisioning event and token generation\n- Public launch\n- Autocompounding pools\n- Delegated voting pool\n- Smart converter\n- Aggregating new DeFi protocol tokens\n- Creating unique DeFi strategies native to METIS\n\n*Athena’s Audit Information*\nGiven that the Hummus Exchange’s contracts are forked from Platypus Finance, Athena Finance’s smart contracts inherit the audit initially conducted for Vector Finance at its launch.\n\n*Security*\nBoth Vector and Athena Finance place utmost importance on security. On the METIS network, all core protocol contracts will be governed by a multisig, ensuring robust security. Additionally, we commit to implementing industry-leading security practices concerning deployer and multisig security. We also pledge to subject any innovative products to rigorous peer-review before deployment, ensuring a secure and reliable experience for our users.\n\n*ATH Token Utility*\nThe Athena token (ATH) serves as the backbone of our protocol, playing a vital role in incentivizing user engagement. The ATH token encourages users to convert and stake protocol tokens such as HUM on our platform by offering rewards in ATH. Furthermore, users can lock ATH tokens to receive a share of the protocol’s fees, and participate in the decision-making process on aggregated protocols through our gauge system, ensuring active community involvement.\n\n*Conclusion*\nIn summary, Athena Finance, a project developed by the experienced Vector Finance team, is poised to help grow the DeFi landscape on the METIS network. Our protocol offers a diverse set of features, including token conversion and staking, boosted yields, voting gauges using ATH tokens, autocompounding pools, and delegated voting pools. Athena Finance’s unique value proposition lies in its ability to fill the existing gap in the METIS ecosystem by aggregating HUM and other protocol tokens, while continuously innovating and developing unique DeFi strategies.\n\nOur comprehensive roadmap includes liquidity provisioning, public launch, and the development of additional features such as smart converters and new DeFi strategies native to METIS. As a security-first organization, both Vector and Athena Finance adhere to the highest standards in smart contract security and multisig governance. Finally, the ATH token plays a central role in our protocol, incentivizing users to engage with our platform and actively participate in the community’s decision-making process.\n\nWe believe by listing Athena Finance as a community verified project, the METIS network will significantly benefit from our building experience, innovation, and commitment to a secure and robust DeFi ecosystem.\n\nThank you for your consideration!\n\nBuilt for the people, run by the people.\n\n-Team Metis",

      "title": "Metis CEG Program: CVP Proposal: Maia DAO",
      "content": "\nWelcome to another exciting episode of our great CEG program. Aiming in giving the community the power to vote on Metis partnerships, we are pleased to present to the community an awesome Project and a candidate of this episode's VCP,\n\nMaia DAO is a decentralized finance (DeFi) yield powerhouse, dedicated to providing a comprehensive ecosystem for various native DeFi financial instruments. Launched fairly through bonds in January 2022 on the Metis Network, the $MAIA token is genuinely community-owned, fostering a robust trading hub.\n\nFeatures:\n- Maia Decentralized Strategy Vaults \n- Hermes Omnichain AMM and YLM (Yield and Liquidity Marketplace) \n- TALOS Transparent Automated Liquidity Omnichain Strategies\n- Ulysses Omnichain Liquidity Protocol\n- Concentrated Liquidity Automated Market Maker Uniswap V3 Maia \n- Community AMM \n- Commonwealth Forum \n- Snapshot Governance \n\nUtility: The Role of $MAIA\nServing as both a utility and governance token, $MAIA, when locked as vMAIA, drives the coordination mechanisms within the Maian ecosystem. This approach facilitates decentralized decision-making and entitles token stakers to a portion of the profits generated by the Maia DAO Treasury.\n\nAs a DAO, Maia continuously strives to enhance its decentralized governance structure and processes. Leveraging OHM’s Staking & Bonding Mechanics during the initial distribution phase, emissions were distributed through rebases, capping the supply at 180,000 $MAIA. Moving forward, $MAIA will only be emitted through strategic bonds proposed via governance.\n\nBy offering exposure to yield-bearing tokens and a curated set of strategies, Maia optimizes liquidity provision and bribe collection within the Hermes Protocol. Each $MAIA token is backed by a basket of blue-chip and revenue-generating assets held in the treasury, such as ETH, stablecoins, and vote-escrowed Hermes or veHERMES (aka bHERMES). This backing ensures a fair minimum value for each $MAIA token.\n\nWith $MAIA, users can\n- Stake their $MAIA into sMAIA\n- Exercise voting rights to control a share of Maia DAO’s Voting Power\n- Earn bribes based on their MAIA Voting Power\n- Receive a portion of Maia’s Treasury Revenue\n- Maximize returns from upcoming Maia Vaults\n\nUniMaia clAMM:\nIn conventional AMMs, liquidity providers must deposit equal quantities of two assets into a liquidity pool, such as ETH and DAI. However, concentrated liquidity AMMs enable providers to focus their liquidity within specific price ranges, resulting in higher trading fee earnings than traditional AMMs. This innovative solution addresses the liquidity fragmentation issue in conventional AMMs and allows users to achieve greater returns on their assets.\n\nThe introduction of a concentrated liquidity AMM on the Metis L2 Network offers several advantages. Primarily, it delivers a more efficient trading experience for users, attracting additional traders and liquidity providers to our network. As a result, our network’s liquidity will increase, leading to higher trading volume and revenue for our ecosystem. With the upcoming Aave deployment on Metis, we are well-positioned to capture a significant portion of on-chain liquidations.\nFurthermore, the concentrated liquidity AMM on the Metis L2 Network creates new revenue sources for our ecosystem and its community members.\n\nHow does it work?\nUtilizing Uniswap’s built-in protocol fee switch, our deployment allocates 10% of generated trading fees as follows:\n- 3% to veHermes Lockers\n- 3% to Maia Stakers\n- 4% to Maia DAO Treasury\nThis distribution benefits all community members by generating and sharing revenue, enabling our DAO to remain competitive sustainably.\n\nConclusion: \nIn summary, the concentrated liquidity AMM on the Metis L2 Network represents a transformative development for our ecosystem and community members. We are confident that this inventive product will draw more traders and liquidity providers to our network, boost liquidity, and establish new revenue sources for all participants. We appreciate your ongoing support and eagerly anticipate offering even more groundbreaking DeFi products (V2) in the future.\n\n![0631614ce0d2066a0365e53d2c19d27c4577e919_2_1035x577.jpeg](ipfs://bafkreigqwb7gm7uoi5g25tsw67knbwgayrxvs4kzm6ntrgnjp4n6fgmsom)\n    \nMake Maia DAO a CVP?

      "title": "Metis CEG Program: CVP Proposal: Frontier Wallet",
      "content": "Welcome to another exciting episode of our great CEG program. Aiming in giving the community the power to vote on Metis partnerships, we are pleased to present to the community an awesome Project and a candidate of this episode's VCP,\nFollowing an educative Twitter spaces through Metis ambassadors, We present;\n\nFrontier Wallet, an advanced non-custodial chain agnostic crypto & NFT wallet with DeFi aggregation capabilities - Multichain Wallet+DeFi Aggregation layer. Frontier supports 28 chains including Metis and the top 50+ DeFi protocols natively (and many more coming up) on DeFiPulse. Our mission at Frontier is to make DeFi, simple, secure, and mobile, hence we currently have an Android and iOS App and are soon launching a Browser extension, Progressive Web App (PWA), and a MacOS app that would allow users, across all platforms (mobile and desktop) to view, track and manage their multiple wallets and Defi portfolios seamlessly from a single interface. Other than performing typical wallet functions like send, receive, store, swap, and buy cryptos & NFTs, Frontier lets its users stake tokens on multiple chains across various validators, bridge tokens across chains, lend & earn, borrow, participate in liquidity pools, create CDPs and trade on token derivatives all in-app acting as a one-stop wallet for all DeFi needs.\n\nKey Metrics:\nFrontier App Users:: 650,000\nWallets Tracked: 8,108,300+\nWeekly Transaction Volume: 25 to 31 million\nDaily Active Users: 5,100+\nWeekly Active Users: 60,000+\nTime Spent on Frontier: 7 minutes per day\nMedia Mentions: 107\nTwitter Followers: 135.5k+\nFrontier Announcement Telegram Channel Members: 12k+\n\n\n\nUse Cases:\nManage DeFi Positions - Engage with multiple protocols & dapps on mobile without setting up separate wallets in a user-friendly way. Native integration of Compound, Aave, Alpaca Finance, Uniswap, Odds etc allow for efficient investment within multiple asset classes with one single step. You can view and manage your Defi positions within the wallet. Stake, Swap, Bridge, Buy, Send, Receive, Lend, Borrow, Farm, all in one place.\n\nMultichain Wallet - Frontier supports tracking & managing multiple assets across blockchain networks. Users can import their wallets and transact in-app within Frontier (Read + Write). Trust, Coinbase Wallet, Rainbow, Argent are natively integrated within Frontier, allowing for complete transaction origination and conclusion within Frontier.\n\nSwapping & Bridging - Swap & bridge tokens with the best available exchange rates across DEXs and bridges.\n\nManage NFTs - Users can store their NFTs and can use the in-app DeFi browser to access trending NFT marketplaces like Openseas, Super rare, etc. We adding more features to use their NFTs for DeFi.\n\nSmart DeFi Notifications - Users can always stay informed about their DeFi, NFT and Gamefi positions cross chains with the Frontier apps notifications feature. Apart from receiving regular wallet notifications, users also receive liquidation alerts, so that liquidations due to the sudden price drop (as experienced on March 12th, 2022) can be avoided.\n\nFiat On-off ramp - Users can convert their fiat into crypto and vice versa in-app seamlessly with our Moonpay, Coinbase, Binance Connect & other onramp integrations offering our users multiple on-ramping options.\n\n\n\nFrontier addresses three major problems existing in the DeFi space:\nAddress Fragmentation- DeFi is certainly coming of age with all the newer chains, protocols, and dapps, the user journey continues to be fragmented, and several. DeFi has currently 84 Billion+ USD of Total Value Locked (TVL as of 25th July 2022), however, there isn’t one single app that allows you to manage your assets. Frontier, however, bridges this gap in DeFi space.\n\nPlatform dependency- The current existing apps that are there, are forcing users to platform dependency. Our users can engage with multiple protocols and dApps on mobile without setting up a separate wallet.\n\nMobile DeFi- Building DeFi on mobile is complex and requires core knowledge of mobile and blockchain development, it’s extremely challenging to find developers with the combination of the right skills. The missing mobile piece will drive the next billion and many more, perhaps a lot more innovation.\n\n",

With 200k+ users, and support for 600+ integrations, it’s finally time for CTC (CryptoTaxCalculator) to integrate with Metis. This will allow Metis Users to import their transactions into CTC by simply pasting in their wallet address.\n\nTech Utility:\nIf you’ve KYC’d anywhere, you’ll need to calculate your taxes. We’ve already built auto-categorisations and suggestions for 600+ integrations and 25+ countries. Allowing you to easily import all of your transactions into one platform, even if you’ve interacted across multiple chains or exchanges.\n\nUnique Value Proposition:\nWe value ourselves on truly supporting DeFi. Whether you’ve just been hodling ETH, or using stETH as collateral to buy more ETH, which then bought an NFT, which you then deposited into an LP and are now staking that LP token to farm rewards daily, your transactions will be correctly imported into CTC. Simpy try importing your wallets into us and any of our competitors, you’ll see the difference straight away. Whether it’s our pricing oracle with covers 300k+ currencies, or our reconciliation view which gives you smart suggestions based on what smart contracted you interacted with and how, there’s a mountain of innovation at CTC.\n\n Make CryptoTaxCalculator a CVP?

      "content": "Welcome to another exciting episode of our great CEG program. Aiming in giving the community the power to vote on Metis partnerships, we are pleased to present to the community an awesome Project and a candidate of this episode's VCP,\nFollowing an educative Twitter spaces through Metis ambassadors, We present;\n\nRubic, a Cross-Chain Tech Aggregator for users and dApps.\nOur vision is that Rubic’s new umbrella SDK will aggregate the best Web3 cross-chain tech - from signals and oracles, NFT bridges, in ready-made templates for DEXs, Lending/Farms, and more. This will help developers easily make their Web3 dApps cross-chain, regardless of what their function is.\n\nWhen Rubic began back in 2020, our team was using integrated bridges as a solution for Cross-Chain swaps, but our development team has since come up with the idea of swapping different assets between different chains. Later, when we started researching this idea, we found out that there are no projects who had similar technology. This was an important moment for our project. Our team decided that we must increase the convenience factor for our users by creating this solution.\n\nRubic’s protocol offers easy trading for more than 15,500+ assets across Ethereum, BNB Chain, Polygon, Avalanche, Fantom, Arbitrum, Gnosis, Fuse, Celo, Klaytn, Velas, Optimism, Moonbeam, OKC, Boba, Tron, Moonriver, Cronos, Kava, Syscoin, Oasis and Bitcoin networks networks, using our custom and unique Cross-Chain Protocol. Utilizing liquidity pools and our own smart contracts, Rubic provides an extremely easy-to-use Cross-Chain solution for all traders and users of Web3. Cross-Chain swaps are currently available between 22 major networks right now, and Metis brings it to 23:\n\nRubic has completed the integration of the Metis network into our Cross-Chain Swap service. This enables users of the Ethereum, BNB Chain, Polygon, Avalanche, Fantom, Arbitrum, Gnosis, Fuse, Celo, Klaytn, Velas, Optimism, Moonbeam, OKC, Boba, Tron, Moonriver, Cronos, Kava, Syscoin, Oasis and Bitcoin networks to easily complete swaps to and from any token in the Metis ecosystem.\n\nThe integration of the Metis network also includes the integration of the NetSwap DEX into our protocol. In the future, we will also integrate other DEXs on the Metis network which will allow us to also be a DEX aggregator for On-Chain swaps on the Metis network.\n\nRubic Relay Widget:\nThe Rubic Relay Widget has the full functionality of Rubic.exchange, and enables users to buy and sell tokens on any website. This means that users of any project can buy that project’s tokens without having to leave their website. Integration is both simple and fast!\nThe current list of partners that have integrated our Widget consists of 60+ projects.\n\nRubic SDK:\nRubic has developed a fundamentally new Cross-Chain Routing integration function for partners and users, where integration is completely free.\n\nMake Rubic a CVP? Let your vote speak!\n\nBuilt for the people, Run by the people.\n\nTeam Metis\n",

      "content": "Welcome to another exciting episode of our great CEG program. Aims in giving the community the power to vote on Metis partnerships, we are pleased to present to the community an awesome Project and a candidate of this episode's VCP, \nFollowing an educative Twitter spaces through Metis ambassadors, We present;\n\nReach, an end to end developer tool. We are an EVM compatible programming language, specialized compiler and deployment tool that drastically lowers the barrier to entry into blockchain development.\n\nReach is modeled with syntax and semantics similar to Javascript, allowing developers to do more with less code. The Reach compiler and verification engine ensures the safety of project code, saving time and money. With protocol-agnostic deployment tools, Reach allows you to launch on the blockchain of your choice.\n\nUnique Value Proposition:\nReach makes it possible for web2 full-stack developers to become web3 developers at a fraction of the time and development cost (over 50% reduction in cost, over 40% reduction in time to build, and over 50% reduction in number of lines of code when compared to traditional blockchain development).\n\nThe next killer DApp will never be built unless thousands more Web2 developers obtain the skills and confidence to build elegant, sophisticated Web3 applications. High quality, rigorous blockchain development curriculum is hard to come by. It can take several months, if not years, to master. Reach has a comprehensive, multi-tiered developer curriculum offering that takes novice Reach developers to accredited Reach developers in the matter of weeks. Traditional MOOC success (graduation) rates are a mere 7%. Reach courses have a 30% graduation rate; 5x more than other training courses. Comprehensive and engaging training courses designed by Reach, ensure students develop the foundational blockchain development knowledge to build stellar DApps that tackle complex real world challenges.\n\nReach has a community of 7,800+ developers\n\nCompletely open source platform and documentation for anyone to access\n\nAn end to end platform that includes a language, compiler with auto-formal verification for security checks, and a network deployment tool that allows the developer to choose where to deploy.\n\nMulti-chain capabilities. Build once, deploy anywhere. Create interoperable applications.\n\n25+ companies have decided to build their businesses using Reach\n\nMulti-level education & curriculum offering:\n- Quarterly developer programs to onboard new developers to Metis and teach them to deploy safe and secure applications to the protocol\n- Bi-weekly retention challenges to keep the community engaged and building on Metis\n- In 4 - 12 weeks we can take web2 developers to full fledged Reach accredited blockchain developers with an ability to build production quality DApps\n- High success/retention rate in graduates, thanks to our team’s engagement and robust mentorship programs\n\nAbsolutely buzzing right? Make Reach a CVP? Let your vote Speak!!!\n\nBuilt for the people, run by the people.\n\n-Team Metis\n\n\n\n",

It accomplishes this through rehypothecation of unborrowed assets & in-house MEV capture.\nGranary is looking to become the cornerstone of DeFi lending by being the most capital efficient money market in DeFi, while also creating positive feedback loops between users, investors and the protocol itself.\n\nTech Features and Utility:\n- Granary is crosschain and currently live on Metis, Ethereum, Optimism, Avalanche, Fantom and Harmony\n- Granary is vertically integrated within the Byte Masons ecosystem and composable to the major DeFi protocols.\n- Granary utilizes our rehypothecation engine Reaper.Farm and puts unused borrow-side assets to work.\n- Granary is set to launch its token -$GRAIN by the end of Q4 2022, which will be accompanied with a brand new, intuitive UI.\n- Granary is the sole arbiter of its MEV capture with in-house liquidations; this, coupled with our rehypothecation engine allows us to limit marketing spend, which is extremely non-dilutive compared to our competition.\n\nValue Proposition:\nOur main goal is to be the most capital efficient lending protocol of DeFi but more importantly usher in actual competition with traditional banks.\nDeFi lending protocols are highly resistant to change, with problems in governance. They are also extremely capital inefficient, with problems with low borrow-side demand, and mercenary liquidity that siphons and dilutes users and stakeholders. Granary solves this by focusing on MEV capture and rehypothecation.\n- Currently, major DeFi protocols have revenues averaging 0.3% of AUM and their cost to revenue averages to $8.59 per dollar.\n- Our technology and experience allows up to 6% of AUM in revenue and our cost to revenue is $0.98 per dollar.\n\nSatisfied with the experience Grana brings to our Ecosystem?

Through Hidden Hand users can earn extra yield on their favorite governance tokens via bribes.\n\nProtocols deposit a bribe into the Hidden Hand smart contract, which are sent back to users as a reward for their voting power. Voters can review the bribes available, or search for a proposal. Once they decide where to commit their voting power, they can determine what portion of their holdings to vote with. After the voting period ends, the incentive pool is distributed to voters based on their share of the overall votes contributed\n\nThrough Hidden hand, voters can earn rewards for actively participating in governance and projects can ensure their most important proposals receive the necessary attention from their community.\n\nFor voters there is no cost to using Hidden Hand, instead the Redacted protocol generates revenue by taking a fee from each bribe.

      "content": "Yet another exciting episode of our great CEG program that aims in giving the community the power to vote on Metis partnerships, we are pleased to present to the community an awesome Project and a candidate of this episode's CVP,\nFollowing an interesting and educative broadcast on our CEG Youtube, We Present;\n\nUniDex: a DeFi aggregation layer & derivatives exchange. At its core, UniDex aims to resolve common pain points DeFi traders have with inefficiencies in swap rates, tools available, and general approach to the UX when compared to CeFi counterparts. We deliver a meta-aggregation strategy allowing trades to always get the best rate on the market without worrying if your favorite dex aggregator is using the latest and most optimized routing method. We also extend this to perpetual-trading protocols allowing traders to access their favorite perp platforms like perpetual protocol (which UniDex has got a grant from), GMX (long-time partner ever since the initial project xvix finance), and more across many networks.\n\nUniDex also delivers a best-in-class leverage trading experience with its leverage trading protocol managed by the UniDex team. Our leverage protocol allows users to trade any asset they truly wish to get exposure to.\n\nFor example, this means you can trade common crypto pairs like ETH & METIS, forex pairs like EURUSD & GBPUSD, stocks like TSLA or the QQQ ETF, or even commodities like gold & silver. These all trade against a single pool for peak capital efficiency and allow poolers to take the process in market making enabling stakers to receive losses & liquidations from traders. Leverage is flexible ranging from 1x-500x with some pairs having a lower limit and all pairs having no minimum leverage.\n\nHighlights:\n- Processed over 500m in volume in 4 months during a bear market\n- Superior Dex Aggregation with the most amount of aggregators connected\n- 1.5m in TVL but carrying multiple times the volume\n- Most amount of unique assets listed across any derivatives leverage protocol\n- IPFS uncensorable access to the protocol\n- Distributed over $500,000 in protocol fees for #RealYield with 0 incentives\n\nProtocol Features (Spot trading):\n- Superior Dex Aggregation allowing for the best rate always\n- Cross chain yield generation for token holders\n- Deployed on 12 different networks\n- Allows for aggregated limit orders\n\nProtocol Features (Leverage):\n- Trade any asset including exotic pairs like BTC/XAU pairs\n- Flexible leverage up to 500x with mechanisms similar to CEXs  (such as adding to existing positions )\n- Fair and predictable funding rates\n- Single staking USDC, ETH, METIS, or FTM\n\nToken mechanics:\n- Deployed on four networks (ETH, FTM, BOBA, METIS)\n- Hold → Fee distributions no staking required 0 smart contract risk\n- RealYield\n- Deep liquidity\n\n\nUpcoming Roadamp\n\nShort term:\n- Limit orders for leverage\n- Removing the size limit in favor of global limits for each pair on each side (targeting this week)\n- Stats page overhaul + pool page (targeting next week)\n- UI improvements for trading (targeting next week)\n\nMid term targets include ( 2+ Months )\n-Cross-chain pooling\n- Looking into deployments on ZkEVM / ZkSync\n- Multi Token pooling\n- First few market first pairs like OSRSgp/USD and custom indexes\n\nLonger term ( 4+ Months )\n- Supporting 0 slippage swaps cross chain between the pools (for example DAI from) Fantom to USDC on Metis with no slippage) This could double as an efficient bridge but also allow very competitive arbitrage strategies.\n- More conditional orders such as trailing stop losses.\n\nAbsolutely buzzing right?! You’re just a vote away to make UniDex a CVP.\n \nLet your vote Speak!\n\nBuilt for the people, run by the people.\n\nTeam Metis",

      "content": "Welcome to another exciting episode of our great CEG program that aims in giving the community the power to vote on Metis partnerships, we are pleased to present to the community an awesome Project and a candidate of this episode's VCP,\nFollowing an interesting and educative broadcast on our CEG Governance Youtube, We Present:\n\nMultifarm, offers a full-stack service to create treasury dashboards and custom dashboards for blockchain protocols. The Multifarm Dashboard technology is trusted by top brands such as Olympus DAO, Polygon DAO, Maia DAO, and Alchemix. Our dashboards are easy to understand, fully customizable and benefit protocols and users alike. \n\nOur vision is to play a fundamental role in building reporting and analytics infrastructure across all chains with the goal of becoming known as an industry leader in the space. We aim to achieve this ambition by optimizing the value added by our services. This includes our flagship product, the treasury dashboard, as well as professional data visualization for Defi (Yields, Emissions, Bribing optimization, etc.).\nWe believe that data visualization plays an important role in the core decision-making process and that every protocol can benefit from a more sophisticated reporting standard. Our partnership with the Metis Ecosystem will greatly expand our layer-2 coverage and is an integral step in our roadmap\n\n\nTech Utility and Features:\nThe partnership will include Multifarm providing internal dashboards to protocols building on Metis. This will include a 12-month membership with any necessary maintenance. We also offer public-facing dashboards (Yield, treasury, custom).\nThe dashboard will contain graphs and tables tracking treasury metrics, providing clean and timely data visualization for core teams to enhance and optimize their monitoring, tracking, and reporting of assets, thereby, enabling a more informed decision-making process.\nThe internal treasury dashboard would be accessible through a premium login exclusive to the team of each protocol. Teams would simply import the respective wallets or portfolio addresses they would like to track after which the app will automatically populate the dashboard\n\nUnique Value proposition:\nWe believe this is a unique offering that will exponentially provide value as new projects build on Metis.\nThe goal is to get new protocols to choose to build on the Metis layer-2 chain over other chains which will increase the number of users, developers, and dApps on the chain. Ultimately, increasing TVL. The dashboard offering serves as a non-monetary incentive in addition to the emissions Metis is giving out to protocols based on TVL.\nFurthermore, we have deep connections in the industry with leading protocols and will refer, where there is a good fit, other protocols and DAOs to Metis and vice versa. Thus, forming a mutually beneficial alliance and acting as the direct linkage\nWe also offer co-marketing for Metis and new protocols. This will include reaching out to our respective audiences & engaging over Discord, Twitter, and Medium. We believe in creating a long-lasting relationship with partners in the space and will endeavour to contribute to that relationship and spread awareness.\n\nMultifarm.fi  aim to create a long-lasting relationship with Metis, being their Core Analytics Partner and main provider of analytical infrastructure to the ecosystem.\n\nExecutive summary of the Partnership:\n- Multifarm is offering our treasury dashboards for all protocols building on Metis\n- Multifarm becomes Metis analytics core partner\n- Makes Metis more attractive for protocols to choose to build on that chain\n- Multifarm gets a solid flow of leads to partner with going forward\n- Multifarm will act as the direct link to current/future partnered protocols we walk them through the Metis ecosystem.\n\nSatisfied with the experience Multifarm brings to our Ecosystem? Let your vote speak!\n\nBuilt for the people, run by the people.\n\n-Team Metis",

      "title": "Metis CEG Program: CVP Episode 18 vote: RelayChain",
      "content": "Welcome to another exciting episode of our great CEG program that aims in giving the community the power to vote on Metis partnerships, we are pleased to present to the community an awesome Project and a candidate of this episode's VCP,\nFollowing an interesting and educative broadcast on our CEG Governance Youtube, We Present:\n\nRelaychain, a portal between blockchains that facilitates cross chain token transfers between a dozen of the world’s leading EVM blockchains. The innovative bridge has been securely transporting user funds since February 2021. Relay is a faithful partner to Metis and has successfully bridged tens of millions in dollar value to the network in cooperation with multiple ecosystem partners. In the upcoming v2 iteration, the bridge will quickly integrate non-EVM blockchains, introduce a bridge user lottery, offer partner rewards for liquidity, token purchases, and begin the release of the Battle of the Blockchains game.\n\nRelayChain is currently connected with several chains like Ethereum, Avalanche, BSC, Polygon, Metis, Moonriver, Moonbeam, IoTeX, Shiden, MultiVAC, HECO and Harmony\nWe are also working to deploy on more chains including Arbitrum, Optimism, ZK sync, Starknet, Near, Cosmos and Solana\n\nBRIDGE DESIGN:\nThe original architecture of the bridge utilized smart contracts and relayers to complete the bridging process. The v2 design will achieve bridging throughthough the use of “sends” and “listeners.” The result is a faster, more secure, and less expensive bridging process.\n\nThe bridge is capable of transferring tokens with two mechanisms: #1 liquidity bridging #2and mint/burn functions.\n\nThe bridge will handle stables and major coin bridging, but any smaller project token can be quickly added for a small fee.\n\nLiquidity Rewards, veRELAY and RELAY Token Utility\n\nWith the new v2 bridge, stablecoin and major token (ETH, wBTC) liquidity will be community provided. Users will deposit their tokens to the bridge and earn yield on those deposits. Users will also be able to stake RELAY to accumulate veRELAY. The veRELAY will boost the earned yield.\n\nThe RELAY token is at the center of the project and holds multiple utilities that will reward users: Earn veRELAY, stake to earn a portion of bridge revenues, buybacks/burns, and also utility within the BOTB game.\n\nUnique Features\n\nV1 Gas token drop. If a user bridges with a “virgin” wallet that has never used the destination blockchain, they will receive enough of the native gas token to complete their first fee transactions. This avoids users becoming “stranded” on a new chain.\n\nV2 Bridging is a critical component of blockchain interoperability. While it is a pleasant experience, it’s not inherently a “fun” experience. RelayChain plans to change this by adding a few features:\n- The first will be a lottery/ jackpot component, where using the bridge will give an entry for a random prize drawing.\n- The other entertaining activity will be the community developed P2E game, Battle of the Blockchains.\n- Purchase gas token on destination chain\n- Token dashboard showing all bridgeable assets in an easily viewable format\n- Easy to use SDK for partner integration\n- Semi-Automated token onboarding\n\n\nAwesome Right, You're a vote away to make Polarys a CVP.\n\nBuilt for the people, run by the people.\n\n-Team Metis",

      "content": "Welcome to  another exciting episode of our great CEG program that aims in giving the community the power to vote on Metis partnerships, we are pleased to present to the community an awesome Project and a candidate of this episode's VCP,\nFollowing an interesting and educative broadcast on our CEG Governance Youtube, We Present:\n\nPolarys, Focusing on bringing utility NFTs to everyday businesses. Polarys aims to propose the easiest Web3 onboarding suite for Web2 users, businesses, creators and entrepreneurs.\nIn order to do so, Polarys built a suite made of 3 products built on Metis Andromeda :\n- Multi-chain Minting Engine\n- Marketplace\n- Wallet\nUsers don’t need to have any code or crypto knowledge to onboard. Polarys focuses on utility NFT and provides an end-to-end solution.\n\nMulti-chain Minting Engine\nMint from Eth, BSC, Polygon, Avax, FTM, Solana or with Fiat to Metis Andromeda. This custom built minting engine allows\n- Any crypto or non-crypto user to be onboarded to Metis\n- Fiat users to be onboarded on-chain without noticing it\nKey features of the AMME:\n- Users don’t need to bridge funds to Metis prior to minting\n- IRL purchases from users at stores will trigger transactions on Metis chain without users knowing they are using it\n\nMarketplace\n- Although Polarys aims to build its custom marketplace, we partnered with Chainstarters to built a white-label solution for Polarys. This allows us to propose a fully-working marketplace out of the box and accelerates our go-to-market.\n- Chainstarters also provides support for Fiat, Ether and Polygon\n- We are working with Chainstarter team to launch their tokengating feature which is crucial for further development of Polarys goal.\n\nWallet\n- Same as for the marketplace, Polarys aims to build its custom wallet solution. Our MVP will be built with Magic.Link which is already integrated with Chainstarters\n- Magic.Link allows Polarys to work with a 1-click wallet solution, removing the hassle of crypto wallet onboarding for Web2 users.\n\n\nUnique Value Proposition\n1. We offer an end to end support along the full lifecycle of utility NFTs, with easy onboarding into web3 and Metis ecosystem in particular. Our offering is made of 3 key parts:\n- Our automated multi-chain minting engine allowing any user to buy an NFT with USDC from ETH, Polygon, AVAX, BSC, FTM and mint it on Metis without needing to bridge the funds\n- A marketplace for selling and reselling utility NFTs, powered by Chainstarters \n- A one-click wallet to enable any non-crypto user to get their wallet set up and get their NFTs in it\n\n2. We focus on utility NFTs only (not only collectibles) that give holders access to tangible rewards from everyday businesses. We aim to be THE reference for utility NFTs from trusted businesses that people use every day online and in real life. One concrete example that we are working on as a proof of concept on our MVP is a coffee shop (in Belgium) that will create on Polarys a collection of 100 NFTs, “Coffee for life”, giving holders access to shipment of a bag of premium coffee shipped to their homes (worldwide) once a month for as long as they hold the NFT\n\n3. We have 2 entities, one in the UK and one in Lithuania and are in the process of getting a crypto exchange and wallet authorisation in the EU. This will enable us to compliantly swap crypto for fiat and hold crypto for our business customers, thus removing here one of the biggest hurdle for crypto adoption from everyday businesses. Concretely this means that any business that launches on Polarys will not have to handle any crypto on their finances.\n\nAwesome Right, You're a vote away to make Polarys a CVP.\n\nBuilt for the people, run by the people.\n\n-Team Metis\n\n \n\n\n",

Vault incentives are rewarded to vaults that have a MAI debt balance and maintain a healthy collateral to debt ratio (CDR). A healthy CDR is defined as 25% to 270% above liquidation ratio.\nEvery 2 weeks, Qi holders are able to vote on which collateral types will receive 180k Qi/week of vault incentives.\n\nQiDao Vaults features\n- Deposit crypto assets as collateral\n- Mint MAI at 0% interest\n- Earn Qi incentives for borrowing\n- Repay loan (0.5% repayment fee)\n- Withdraw collateral\n- Transfer vault to another wallet if you wish\n\nQi Boosting features\n- Lock Qi from 1 week up to 4 years\n- The longer your lock the more voting power and reward boost you receive\n- Must lock to receive weekly revenue share based\n\nAbsolutely buzzing right?

Our goal is to offer simple, creamy stableswaps (USDT, USDC, DAI) with deep liquidity to the METIS community, allowing them the ability to capitalize on stable-based opportunities in a timely and cost effective manner. HUM is the native token to Hummus Exchange.\n\nFeatures;\n- Single Sided Staking\n- Gamified Staking Boost through veHUM\n- Flexibile Liquidity Pool\n-  Low Liquidity Fragmentation\n\nHummus for Stakers;\n- Stake USDT/USDC/DAI without the risk of impermenant loss\n- Earn HUM tokens and trading fees as staking reward\n- Ability to stake HUM to receive veHUM\n- Stake veHUM to enjoy a BOOST in staking rewards\n- Withdraw the exact same number of tokens initially deposited (plus rewards)\n- Participate in Hummus governance with veHUM\n\nHummus for Traders;\n- Swap to and from USDT/USDC/DAI with minimum slippage\n- Capital Efficiency\n- Easy scalability of liquidity pools with new tokens\n\nHummus offers single sided staking which removes the risk of impermenant loss to the staker. It is common in liquidity provision to be required to pair two assets together. As the value of one asset, the other, or both, fluctuates, the liquidity value of the staker adjusts to maintain a balance. This creates the risk of impermenant loss, where one or both assets fluctuate significantly, leaving the staker with substantially less or one asset and substantially more of another. The impermenant part of the loss comes with the theory that if the staker were to hold the depressed asset for long enough and it’s price recovers, the loss is erased. Instead of pools of token pairs and bundles, Hummus Exchange uses accounts of tokens to record assets and liabilities, allowing single-sided liquidity provision, removing the risk of impermenant loss completely.\n\nExchange incentivizes users to stake their stablecoins into the protocol, with no risk of impermenant loss, creating deep stablecoin liquidity. The gamification of veHUM encourages the long-term staking of stablecoins within the protocol, minimizing volatility in liquidity. This liquidity is then enjoyed by the METIS ecosystem at large as a delicious and easy avenue for moving between stablecoins while preserving capital.\n\nSatisfied to make Hummus a Community Verified Project?

Memo has developed an interactive and intuitive APIs that facilitate developers and validated nodes to store and access data via this interface, with our state-of-art technology and friendly incentive mechanism supporting high data availability and security.\n\nMemo allows Metis to tranfer transactional data to its decentralised storage layer without having to directly store the transactional data on the ethereum network. Its sequencer first stores a large volume of transactional data on Memo's decentralised storage layer and then publishes the storage index of the transactional data on ethereum. This integration has cause a drop in trasaction fees significantly making Metis now the cheapest of all L2s\n\nThe Memo token (MetaMemo) which is cryptographically compliant,will serve as the main token for storage,retrieval and download services.  Consumers in need of cloud computing services are billed in the native token, this fee generated eventually goes to keepers and providers. This in effect incentivizes the nodes to continuously secure the network as proportion of revenue generated is reimbursed to storage providers and matchers,keepers who are constantly mapping storage availability to those in need of storage services.\n\nThe protocol has been designed in such a way that anyone who wants to call any storage function to store data,retrieve data or download data would need to pledge /stake token to be able to have access. This is designed that way to regulate the behaviors of keepers and provider nodes to always advocate reliable services.The token will in future give rights to holders to participate in the governance of the protocol and decide on future governance mechanisms.\n\nAbsolutely buzzing right?

      "content": "As an essential part of our great CEG program that aims in giving the community the power to vote on Metis partnerships, we are pleased to present this week's CVP voting to the community.\nAfter an exciting Livestream on our CEG Governance Youtube;\n\nTethys Finance proved to be  the first decentralized Metis-native all-in-one trading platform. Tethys Finance has set out to build the most innovative and secure trading platform for the Metis community. The idea was pretty simple: what if you could do all the Swapping, Farming, Staking, Borrowing, Lending, Leveraged Farming and even more on one platform? And that’s how Tethys Finance was born.\n\nCurrently, most DeFi projects focus on one of the above. Swapping and liquidity providing is the Holy Grail for every DEX out there, but this product lineup leaves users looking for other platforms when it comes to farming or lending. As a result, DeFi has a bottleneck that newcomers have to immerse themselves into the Defi ecosystem and trust multiple projects with their funds simultaneously, thus increasing the risks.\n\nHowever, Tethys Finance provides experienced users and newcomers with a seamless, user-friendly experience for every product in the lineup. By incorporating Swapping, Liquidity providing, Farming, Lending, Borrowing and Bridging into one platform, Tethys Finance provides the community with an advanced, native, decentralized exchange app to handle all kinds of trading needs.\n\nDeveloping cutting-edge technology and pushing boundaries of what can be accomplished with DeFi as well as staying lean and taking care of the community, are the core values of our team. With speed, the lowest transaction cost out of all L2s and security offered by Metis Andromeda network, Tethys Finance Team is eager to continue developing the project for years to come.\n\nAbsolutely buzzing right?  Make Tethys a CVP?  Let your vote Speak!!!\n\nBuilt for the people, run by the people.\n\n-Team Metis",

Our mission is to empower individuals to participate in their favorite projects by reducing the barrier of entry to a minimum. In that view, we have decided to support Metis Network and we’re already lucky to count 14 Metis projects including MetisDAO itself, Tethys Finance, NetSwap, Mini Metis, or Maia DAO\n\nSnapshot’s current architecture relies on off-chain factors to let individuals sign messages instead of having to realize a costly (or not so costly in the case of Metis) on-chain transaction. Therefore, we’re not really based on any singular chain but we support most EVM-compatible chains for which there is demand. We’re very happy to see the quick growth of the Metis ecosystem and we’d like to continue working with the team to ensure users have a smooth and appealing experience when it comes to participating in decentralized governance.\n\nSnapshot has no token, and there’s no need for one to participate.\n\nWhile many platforms seek to copy Snapshot’s success, Snapshot has weathered competition in part due to its mission to be a public good for the web3 ecosystem. No value extraction, no data harvesting, no ads, no nothing. We’re very proud of that mission and even prouder to see more and more projects in the ecosystem embrace that vision.\n\nExcited to have Snapshot as part of our CVP?
