      "title": "SCP-186 rFOX LP Expansion to Include Uniswap V2 FOX/WETH Tokens on Arbitrum",
      "content": "Proposal Discussion\n\nSummary\n\nThis proposal seeks to expand the current rFOX staking program to include liquidity provider (LP) tokens from the Uniswap V2 FOX/WETH pool on Arbitrum. This expansion is designed to enhance liquidity, broaden participation, and increase the utility and value of FOX on the Arbitrum network. A separate financial bucket is proposed to track and manage the funds and rewards associated with this expansion, with clear governance over the allocation and source of these funds.\n\nMotivation\n\nIntegrating Uniswap V2 FOX/WETH LP tokens from Arbitrum into the rFOX staking program will deepen liquidity on decentralized exchanges, enhancing the stability and utility of the FOX token. Recognizing the full value of the LP tokens in the staking rewards motivates liquidity providers by compensating them for the total risk and capital they contribute. Establishing a separate bucket for managing these funds ensures transparency and targeted use of resources, aligning with strategic tokenomics objectives for the DAO.\n\nSpecification\n\n• Eligible Tokens: Uniswap V2 LP tokens consisting of FOX and WETH pairs on the Arbitrum network.\n\n• Reward Structure: LP stakers will be rewarded based on the entire value of their LP tokens, in line with the existing rFOX staking mechanics.\n\n• Financial Management: Creation of a separate financial bucket to manage the influx and allocation of resources specifically for this expansion.\n\n• Source of Funds: The specific breakdown will be voted on. The funds will either come from current 25% of RUNE fees allocated to fox stakers or 25% of RUNE fees that are swapped into FOX and burned.\n\nKPIs\n\n• Total Value Locked (TVL) on Arbitrum: Aim for a 10% month-over-month increase.\n\n• Net FOX Deposits vs. Withdrawals Across Chains: Ensure a positive net amount each month, indicating growing or stable liquidity which supports sustained liquidity provision.\n\n• Price Stability Index (PSI): Aim for a 5% month-over-month growth of the PSI, getting smaller as the PSI is closer to 1, which would indicate less price volatility and greater stability.\n\n• Slippage Metrics: Maintain specific slippage thresholds across various trade sizes: under 0.5% for trades up to $1,000, under 1.5% for trades up to $10,000, and under 2.5% for trades up to $20,000.\n\n• Staker Retention Rate: Maintain a month-over-month staker retention rate of 20-30%, demonstrating sustained participant interest and commitment.\n\nBenefits\n\n• Enhanced Liquidity: More FOX and WETH liquidity on Arbitrum improves trade efficiency and reduces slippage.\n\n• Increased Participation: Attracts a broader participant base by recognizing their total investment in liquidity pools.\n\n• Network Expansion: Supports the growth of FOX on the Arbitrum ecosystem, consistent with our Layer 2 expansion goals.\n\nNo allocation needed: Exists without monitoring or continuous allocation\n\nRisks and Considerations\n\n• Smart Contract Risks: Integration with new contracts could introduce risks; thorough audits and testing are recommended.\n\nFracturing existing rfox single-sided fox staker rewards. Existing rfox single-sided stakers will earn less of the total fees, meaning that an individuals return on their fox locked into rfox would be lowered as a result of this proposal passing.\n\nConclusion\n\nExpanding the rFOX staking program to include Uniswap V2 FOX/WETH LP tokens on Arbitrum, with a separate financial bucket for targeted management and DAO oversight, aims to foster greater liquidity and user engagement. This proposal aligns with ShapeShift’s broader goals of enhancing liquidity, user experience, and network participation.\n\nVote\n\nFor with 50dao/15_rfox_stakers/10_lp_stakers/25_burn\nFor with 50dao/20_rfox_stakers/15_lp_stakers/15_burn\nFor with 50dao/12.5_rfox_stakers/12.5_lp_stakers/25_burn\nFor with 50dao/10_rfox_stakers/15_lp_stakers/25_burn\nFor with 50dao/35_rfox_stakers/15_lp_stakers/0_burn\nFor with 50dao/30_rfox_stakers/20_lp_stakers/0_burn\nFor with 50dao/25_rfox_stakers/10_lp_stakers/15_burn\nFor with 60dao/25_rfox_stakers/15_lp_stakers/0_burn\nAgainst\n\nSorry for those that already voted, an option was left off, has been added.",

      "content": "Abstract / Overview\nThis proposal is to continue to fund the Engineering Workstream’s budget for 6 months, October 1st, 2024 through March 31st, 2025.\n\nThe ShapeShift DAO relies on the Engineering Workstream to maintain the code base, undertake core engineering work to enable new features, and to provide architectural oversight and technical leadership as we continue to execute the roadmap as defined by the Community and Product Workstream.\n\nMotivation\nTo continue to provide the DAO the needed engineering resources to maintain the existing product offering and implement new functionality.\n\nSpecification\nTeam\n0xapotheosis\n\ngomes\n\nkaladinlight\n\nwoodenfurniture\n\nneomaking\n\n0xean\n\nMandate\nNo changes to mandate. See previous renewal 1.\n\nBudget\nThe details below expand upon the budget spreadsheet 2 (the previous renewal sheet is also available at the same link for comparison)\n\nTotal amount requested over 6 month: $511,500 + $91,000 USD in FOX\n\nThe amount of FOX requested will be locked in on Oct 7, 2024 by using a 7 day daily-VWAP calculated by taking the daily mid price (Low + High / 2), multiplied by that day’s volume averaged over 7 days using data from CoinMarketCap. The intended use of this FOX is discussed below.\n\nRecurring costs\nLabor\n\nThe budget currently retains the 5 existing engineers from the previous workstream. There is no compensation for a workstream leader built into this budget as a new WS leader will need to be ratified by governance and can negotiate compensation at that time.\n\nInfrastructure\n\nThese costs are currently being paid by the Foundation and are not included in the workstream’s budget but are managed by the workstream.\n\nNon-recurring costs\nMiscellaneous\n\nThe budget contains a line item for $10,000 USDC of discretionary funds which may be used for travel, conferences, retreats etc, at engineering’s discretion.\n\nThe line item above is provisional, and any unspent funds will be returned to the DAO.\n\nContingency\n\nUnforeseen costs will arise and 10% of the USDC subtotal is requested accordingly.\n\nThe budget seeks approval for $49,500 for contingency to be spent judiciously at the workstream’s discretion, shall it be required.\n\nVariance\n\nUnused funds from any budget category will be returned to the DAO at the end of the budget cycle.\n\nIn the event that the Engineering Workstream requires more funds, a separate governance proposal shall be raised.\n\nChanges from previous renewal\nCompared to last cycle’s budget we are requesting $22,000 less in USDC and $4,000 US dollars less equivalent of FOX tokens.\n\nFox compensation\nAll engineers who remain engaged full-time with the workstream for the duration of the budget cycle (6 months) will receive a 20% bonus in FOX that will be paid out evenly over the following 6 months starting April 1, 2025. Any engineer who leaves or is terminated before March 31 2025, will not be eligible for this incentive. For any newly hired engineer, the discretion of how to fairly pro-rate this is left to the discretion of the workstream leader.\n\nThe price of FOX used for this calculation will be the reference price mentioned above.\n\nEngineers may opt for any additional amount of their stable compensation as FOX.\n\nReporting\nThe workstream will continue to post monthly updates (1 1,2 1,3 1,4 1,5 1) to the community published to the forum and provide visibility into its work on GitHub (project boards, issues, and pull requests). If the community has additional requests for reporting, the workstream is happy to consider them and ensure that there is visibility and transparency.\n\nInterim leader\n0xean will act as interim leader of the workstream but the DAO is encouraged to find and elect another more permanent workstream leader who will replace him as soon as possible.\n\nBenefits\nEnsures continuity of the existing engineering team with retention incentives\nDrawbacks\nUSDC and FOX spend\nNo permanent workstream leader",

      "title": "[SCP-184] Tokenomics Workstream Renewal Proposal (08.01.24 - 02.28.25)",
      "content": "Summary\n\nProfMcCarthy is seeking the ShapeShift community’s approval for the continuation of his leadership in the Tokenomics Workstream from August 1, 2024, to February 28, 2025. This proposal includes a request for compensation of $14,000 per month in FOX tokens and outlines strategic focuses on analytics, fee optimization, operational coordination, and enhanced dashboard development. It also introduces a shared bonus structure ($10k total of fox tokens) to recognize the contributions of all key team members involved in achieving the defined KPI. Additionally, this proposal introduces a $8,000 per term USDC allocation for dashboard work and other contracting needs for the tokenomics workstream.\n\nAbstract\n\nUnder ProfMcCarthy’s leadership, the Tokenomics Workstream has made significant progress in enhancing operational efficiency, financial transparency, and dashboard development over the past six months. Despite challenges posed by volatile markets, the Workstream has adapted its strategies to improve DAO operations and lay a solid foundation for future growth. Moving forward, the focus will be on refining financial management strategies and further aligning with the DAO’s long-term goals.\n\nReflection and Strategy Adjustment\n\nAcknowledging the successes and the areas for improvement over the past term, ProfMcCarthy has taken the opportunity to refine the Workstream’s approach by implementing new controls, policies, and procedures. Key adjustments include:\n\nRefined Fee Models: Continuous adjustment of fee mechanisms to better align with market fluctuations, aiming to optimize revenue generation for the DAO.\n\nExpanded Financial Dashboards: Further development of comprehensive dashboards for tracking revenue, liquidity, treasury, and rFOX activities, enhancing data-driven decision-making.\n\nImproved Resilience Plans: Strengthening contingency strategies to manage unexpected financial scenarios and maintain DAO stability.\n\nEnhanced Transparency: Ongoing efforts to simplify and improve documentation and communication around DFC meetings and decisions.\n\nMotivation\n\nThis proposal leverages ProfMcCarthy’s expertise in decentralized finance, economic analysis, and DAO treasury management to continue guiding the Tokenomics Workstream. His deep understanding of DAO operations, multisig coordination, and decentralized governance challenges positions him well to navigate the evolving market landscape and implement effective tokenomic strategies.\n\nSpecification and Future Focus\n\nIn his continued role, ProfMcCarthy will concentrate on the following areas:\n\n• Analytics and Fee Optimization: Working closely with the product team to refine fee models using detailed analytics of user behavior and market conditions.\n\n• Operational Coordination: Facilitating smooth communication and coordination between the DFC, multisig signers, and broader DAO operations, ensuring efficient transaction processing and governance actions.\n\n• Strategic Financial Management: Leading the development of advanced financial dashboards, overseeing asset diversification, and executing stablecoin strategies to strengthen the DAO’s financial health.\n\nRevised Goals and KPIs\n\nTo align with the updated goals, the following KPIs will be tracked and reported regularly to the community:\n\nFee Optimization Effectiveness:\n• Measure the percentage increase in total fees generated over the past quarter by refining fee models.\n\n• Target: Achieve a 10% increase in fees generated by the end of the term.\n\n• Report quarterly on changes made to fee models and their impact on revenue.\n\nDashboard Development and Utilization:\n• Track the number of completed dashboard enhancements (e.g., new metrics, visualizations) and their adoption rate by the DFC and community.\n\n• Target: Develop and implement at least three major dashboard updates by the end of the term, with a 75% utilization rate by stakeholders as measured by a survey of some kind.\n\n• Report monthly on the progress of dashboard updates and utilization metrics.\n\nContingency Strategy Implementation:\n• Track the number of contingency strategies developed and tested for unexpected financial scenarios.\n\n• Target: Develop and implement at least two new contingency plans and test them through simulations or real-world applications.\n\n• Report every two months on new strategies, testing results, and any adjustments made.\n\nTransparency in Decision-Making:\n• Monitor the frequency and clarity of communication around DFC meetings, decisions, and documentation. Also assess clarity of communication with survey?\n\n• Target: Publish agendas, minutes, and summaries for 100% of DFC meetings, with a simplified format accessible to the community.\n\n• Report after each DFC meeting with a summary document available on the community forum.\n\nCommunity Reporting Frequency:\n• Track the frequency and consistency of reporting KPI progress to the community.\n\n• Target: Provide a comprehensive KPI report every month to the community, detailing progress on each of the above goals.\n\n• Report monthly via the ShapeShift community forum, including any challenges, adjustments, or notable achievements.\n\nOther Components to Track:\n\n• Engaged rFOX Holders:\n\nMeasure the number of rFOX holders participating in trading activities on the platform.\n\n• Cross-Utility Traders:\n\nTrack the number of traders who are also rFOX holders and the volume of their trades.\n\n• Conversion to rFOX:\n\nAssess the number of traders who purchase FOX and subsequently become rFOX holders.\n\n• Active Usage for Fee Discounts:\n\nMonitor the number of unique addresses using FOX for fee discounts, and measure the frequency and volume of their transactions.\n\n• LP Engagement:\n\nTrack the number of token holders participating in liquidity provisioning (LPing) activities, and evaluate changes over time in the volume and diversity of LP positions held.\n\n• Utility Diversification Score:\n\nDevelop a composite score that reflects the distribution of FOX usage across various planned tokenomics use cases (fee discounts, rFOX, LPing, etc.).\n\nShared $10k Total Bonus Structure to the DFC\n\nThe $10k bonus will be a shared reward system (split evenly among DFC members) recognizing the collective efforts of the Workstream Leader and key contributors, including DFC members. The $10k of FOX tokens would be distributed if and only if the DAO increases its stablecoin holdings to >$1MM by the end of this term.\n\nBenefits\n\nContinuing ProfMcCarthy’s leadership will ensure stability and continued innovation within the Tokenomics Workstream. His expertise in economic strategy and proven track record in decision-making provide a robust foundation for advancing the DAO’s tokenomics.\n\nDrawbacks\n\nThere are inherent risks in allocating resources for compensation and pursuing dynamic tokenomic strategies, particularly in a volatile market environment. However, these risks are mitigated by the proposed shared bonus structure and a focus on diversified metrics that align with the DAO’s long-term goals.\n\nVote\n\n• For: Endorse ProfMcCarthy’s continued leadership, supporting the strategic advancements and refined goals proposed for the next term, alongside the $10k of fox distributed reward system to the DFC and $8k of USDC for dashboard work.\n\n• Against: Oppose the renewal, eliminating the Tokenomics workstream and ceasing progress on the above efforts for the DAO.",

Congrats Hoff !\n- The budget is reducing topline slightly as a result.\n- We’re leaving contingency funds in the Product colony.\n- Tactical changes to goals particularly meeting with people 1:1, we missed bigly on that goal, motivating FBL.\n\n### **Abstract -**\n\nAs a product-centric DAO, the Product Workstream is accountable for a number of activities: cross workstream alignment on execution, retaining/acquiring users, growing the FOX ecosystem, speccing/launching new product lines, and achieving Shapeshift’s mission. \n\nOn product’s approval last year, governance approved the portfolio of bets and adaptive roadmapping. Though it wasn’t required we did a goals performance breakdown at the end of the year  https://forum.shapeshift.com/t/product-goals-review-dec-1/2837 and again this summer https://forum.shapeshift.com/t/goals-1-h-2024-check-in/3079.\n\nJust like last renewal, A YES vote verifies the budget and team continuing, and also support for product’s execution strategy namely: \n\n- Supporting for the strategy for 2024 “the themening”  https://forum.shapeshift.com/t/the-themening-a-pob-sequel/2888 applying a portfolio of bets every quarter.\n- Approval of the 2nd half of the year’s goals https://forum.shapeshift.com/t/goals-1-half-2024/2875/2 and their metrics/KPIs. These goals continue with slight tactics tweaks and refreshed northstars.\n- An acknowledgement that all of this is flexible by design so we can capture market opportunities without putting granular items to vote or grand roadmap proposals.\n\n### **Specification -**\n\nWe track our goals at every office hours improving our documentation, rigor, and velocity. We produce artifacts every time, giving a snapshot of performance and a high level overview of what’s going on. Working with operations we publish a release thread almost every week https://forum.shapeshift.com/c/workstream-discussion/operations/20\n\n Onwards and upwards!\n\n## **Revised Goals :**\n\n- **Goal 1: Iterate & Execute on the Portfolio of Bets (POB) utilizing Themes each quarter**\n- **Goal 2: Talk to Our Users & Deepen Ecosystem Partnerships**\n    - **(FBL will grind for a stretch goal of 100 user interviews by march 1)**\n- **Goal 3: Refine Retention and Build Towards the North Star**\n    - **(300 MM month-on-month volume north star)**\n- **Goal 4: Conduct Scoped Beneficial Experiments, Kill Under-performant ones, and remove app bloat.**\n\n**Responsibilities**\n\n- Prioritize and adjust the roadmap with cross workstream alignment.\n- Analyzing and surfacing new revenue streams that are not listed yet in the roadmap, but reporting back to the community with more details.\n- Coordinating research and resourcing in partnership with the FOX foundation.\n- Organizing and managing the roadmap, coordinating with engineering on timelines.\n- Removing blockers, assisting with product related decisions and keep things moving through the feature development process and Product/Engineering status updates throughout the week.\n- Product representation at the Weekly Ops Sprint.\n- Weekly release thread with operations.\n- Conducting user tests and mentoring other product team members to manage them on their own.\n- Facilitate bi-weekly office hours to provide updates on progress, report on KPIs for all initiatives, and offer space to the community to ask questions, give feedback, and pitch ideas.\n- Draft product specs, reviewing designs, work with ENG workstream to evaluate engineering resources, and iterate the feature development process.\n- Hosting and Leading Spec kickoffs/spikes/breakdowns between Product and Engineering.\n- Spinning up regular retros (at either phase completion or large feature completeness)\n- Leading and continuing all scheduled team syncs and 1-on-1s.\n- Managing Budget and workstream contributor payments made through Colony.\n- Coordinating strategy sessions, touchpoint, and retros for launches. Facilitating where necessary.\n\n### **Budget and team**\n\nThe Product workstream will consist of 3 members all full-time.\n\n \n![Screenshot 2024-08-19 at 5.23.07 PM.png](ipfs://bafkreihpvaxlrsrvnaotfhuzahq6ww5vuxnirgufw5c34ikkvmmkhniwyq)\n  \n\n### **The total budget** Breakdown of September- February\n\n**Monthly**:\n\n$ 69 for figma\n$ 400 USD of FOX  for User testing budget \n$ 6600 USD of FOX salary — (16% decrease) \n$ 34400 USDC salary — (6% less)\n\n$41,469 MONTHLY TOTAL \n\nTerm Totals come out to:\n\n$ 2400 USD of FOX  for user testing\n$ 39,600 USD of FOX \n$ 206,814 USDC (Salary plus figma)\n\n**$248,814.** **TOTAL**\n\nThis is the previous total budget:\n \n![previous budget .png](ipfs://bafkreifizfwb4ti4ef2btqyr3n6lxubijjqxsgc53lishgk3wo5lkoun7u)\n\nThe change to the DAO topline budget is 6% less. \n \n![Screenshot 2024-08-26 at 9.36.57 PM.png](ipfs://bafkreih5qitbsff3ytgzqepiqoxf5bkuun2c3x45pb7x3kle6h2zasah2i)\n    \n    \nThe addendums are the earmarked SaaS budget and the retained events budget.:\n\n- SaaS\n    - Figma [$69 a mo for the team]\n- current funds: [$2454] —> continue holding funds in colony.\n    - previously we earmarked $200 a team member for flight or stipend to ETH denver and kept a small contingency. No one went to denver, so we’ll leave these contingency funds for now. Those should be helpful for any additional SaaS we may trial or any work product would like to contract that requires USDC\n\n### **Benefits -**\n\n- Unlocks new features, continues alignment with a strategic lens, and continues execution of the product team’s goals.\n- Unblocks engineering and ships the roadmap, \n- Gets the roadmap going in iterative loops, with extra hand holding by FBL\n- executes quarterly with full transparency for Governance. \n\n### **Drawbacks -**\n- We’re moving with more rigor so we aren’t shipping as many shiny features. \n- Our team is lean so there is only so many resources to cross allocate",

      "title": "SCP 182 - rFOX KPIs",
      "content": "### Summary:\n\nThis revised proposal ratifies accountability metrics for the rFOX staking program, providing clear KPIs tracking its success and offering the community tangible goals. These metrics will ensure the program’s performance is transparently evaluated, enthusiastically marketed, and built on a solid foundation. It allows for robust monitoring, frequent evaluation and adjustment to stimulate the KPIs, and/or sunsetting if it fails to meet performance.\n\n### Abstract:\n\nThe ShapeShift DAO has already approved “SCP-166 an upgrade to FOX tokenomics” involving RUNE distribution and FOX token burns. This proposal builds on that foundation by implementing a robust set of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) measuring the success of the rFOX staking program. By setting clear goals, we aim to drive community engagement, ensure effective use of resources, and foster a culture of accountability within the DAO. If the program is a smashing success, this proposal outlines the numbers qualifying that success. If the program underperforms over a defined period, it will be sunset, preventing resource drain on unsuccessful performance. We already made a dashboard for these for reporting at product office hours: [Dune Dashboard](https://dune.com/shapeshift/rfox).\n\n### Motivation:\n\n- **Accountability**: Establish clear metrics ensuring the rFOX staking program is held accountable for its performance. This proposal adds measurable goals and significantly increases the marketability of rFOX participation.\n- **Community Engagement**: Provide the community with specific goals to support and rally around, enhancing user engagement and participation. By setting these goals, we aim to elevate our current/future community’s involvement, encouraging everyone to rise together towards common objectives.\n- **Governance Responsibility**: By having a broad consensus and agreement about what constitutes success, the workstreams and the DAO are better equipped and informed in future possible trajectories of this (and related programs).\n- **Resource Efficiency**: Ensure that the DAO’s resources are used effectively by evaluating success, adjustment, and/or under-performance. If the program doesn’t meet the established bar every month, we can redirect resources aiming toward growth.\n\n### Specification:\n\n- **KPIs Implementation**: Introduce a comprehensive set of KPIs to track the success of the rFOX staking program.\n- **Regular Reporting**: Provide a live dashboard and regular updates on KPI performance to the community. Reporting will be done at every product office hour and potentially added to the monthly IPFS posting thread. In addition, the DFC will report on the FOX-tokenomic performance of the program, evaluating it for incentive adjustments and iterations.\n- **Success, Perseverance, & Sunset Criteria**: Define clear criteria for the success of the program. The KPIs give the community the necessary input for the program's growth. It should be obvious if the program is gaining traction, slowly succeeding, enabling participation, or underperforming. A strict number of KPI’s succeeding is too prescriptive, but bi-weekly reporting by product, weekly monitoring by the DFC, and the level of effort from engineering is sufficient to steer the program towards better outcomes.\n\n### Main KPIs and Goals:\n\n1. **Staking Participation Rate**:\n    - **Definition**: The percentage of total FOX tokens staked by users, calculated as rFOX deposits divided by the total FOX supply (liquid and in circulation).\n    - **Goal**: Based on the first month; 5% MoM growth is a good benchmark. Failure is not achieving a 5% month-over-month growth for three consecutive months, indicating low user engagement and interest.\n    - **Measurement**: This will be measured both as an average over three months and month-on-month (and daily just for funsies/because we can). We will use reliable sources like Arbiscan & CoinGecko to ensure consistency and transparency for circulating supply.\n2. **Increase Trading Volume and FOX Burn**:\n    - **Definition**: The trading volume on ShapeShift increases, leading to increased FOX burns.\n    - **Goal**: Within 3 months of August 2024, $24,000 per month is a success case and $75,000 of FOX burned per month is a smashing success. Failure is 3 consecutive months of sub $15,000 burnt (staying at our status quo).\n    - **Measurement**: For holistic reporting, this will be measured both as month-on-month growth and by applying an average figure over the programs lifetime to date (e.g, 3 then 4 months etc.)\n3. **Number of Unique Stakers**:\n    - **Definition**: The total number of unique users participating in the staking program month-on-month.\n    - **Goal**:  Per month we want growth, so < 50 unique stakers is a failure, ≥ 100 is a success, and 400+ is a smashing success. Several months of underperformance should be cause for concern.\n4. **Staker Gini Coefficient**:\n    - **Definition**: The Gini coefficient of stakers in the pool above a certain threshold (100,000 FOX). A lower Gini coefficient indicates a more equitable distribution, we want more users holding and staking FOX.\n    - **Goal**: For 38,843 FOX holders that currently exist, aim for a target at about 0.6 – 0.3 for smashing success. A failure here is 0.7 and above for consecutive months, combined with no new stakers (KPI 3).\n5. **Staker Retention Rate**:\n    - **Definition**: The percentage of users who continue staking their FOX tokens over multiple months.\n    - **Goal**: 15%-25% retained stakers indicate success, and 30%-55% indicate smashing success. A staker retention rate of less than 15% for two quarters is a failure.\n6. **Average Staking Duration**:\n    - **Definition**: The average length of time users keep ≥ 30,000 FOX tokens staked, 60,000 FOX tokens staked, 90,000 FOX tokens staked.\n    - **Goal**: For 65% of the staking addresses: 2 months staked indicates success, 4 months indicates growth, and 8 months indicates smashing success. One month or less is failure. \n\n### Ancillary KPIs (Nice to Haves):\n\n1. **Percentage of Active Traders Depositing into rFOX**:\n    - **Goal**: We want to be able to say something like “50% of stakers have done 1 trade in the last month.”\n2. **Trading Volume & Number of Dolphin Holders of FOX and RUNE**:\n    - **Goal**: 10%, 25%, and 45% increases in the number of holders for success —> growth.\n    - **Measurement**: Volume looks like 1 million per day FOX volume indicates success.\n3. **Total RUNE Distributed**:\n    - **Goal**: Track to seek insights; simply tracking indicates success.\n4. **User Feedback and Satisfaction**:\n    - **Goal**: Get actual feedback; 0 indicates failure/status quo, 5 in-depth interviews (recorded and paid in FOX) indicate success, and 50 indicate growth.\n5. **Unique Visitors to Platform and rFOX Page**:\n    - **Goal**: Increase unique Monthly active visitors; Above 35K is success, Below 10k is a failure.\n\n### Benefits:\n\n- **Enhanced Accountability**: Clear KPIs ensure the program is held accountable for its performance.\n- **Increased Engagement**: Tangible goals provide the community with a clear focus, driving engagement and participation.\n- **Resource Optimization**: Prevents resource drain on underperforming programs by setting criteria for success and/or sunsetting.\n- **Governance Responsibility**: Encourages responsible decision-making and ownership within the DAO.\n\n### Drawbacks:\n\n- **Resource Allocation**: Requires ongoing effort to monitor and report on KPIs.\n- **Operational Burden**: Increases workload for tracking and managing the program’s performance.\n- **Potential Disruption**: Sunsetting the program could disrupt current users if KPIs are not met.\n\n### Vote:\n\n- **For**: Formalizes the community’s support for implementing accountability metrics for the rFOX staking program.\n- **Against**: Opposes the implementation of accountability metrics for the rFOX staking program.",

      "title": "[SCP-181] DFC Alternate Expansion & Gk as Initiate Alternate DFC Member",
      "content": "Abstract:\n\nTo accommodate the expanded responsibilities of the DFC and to manage occasional member absences, we propose adapting our framework to include an alternate member role. This role ensures uninterrupted governance by stepping in as required.\n\nSummary:\n\nThis proposal introduces an alternate member role to the DAO Finance Committee (DFC) to ensure governance continuity, outlines a tailored compensation scheme, and specifies procedures for electing or removing an alternate member.\n\nMotivation:\n\nThe increasing workload of the DFC, combined with the community’s demand for continuous and robust governance, highlights the necessity for an alternate member who can maintain the effectiveness of our financial governance during regular member absences.\n\nSpecification:\n\nAlternate Member Role: Introduce a role for an alternate dfc member who steps in under specific conditions to ensure DFC continuity.\n\n10% Retainer: The alternate member will receive 10% of the base compensation of a regular DFC member, paid monthly, provided they attend at least 50% of the meetings (formalities to verify this presence up to the regular members). This compensates them for staying informed and ready to step in when needed.\n\nDaily Rate: The alternate member will receive an additional 1/30th of the base compensation for each day they are required to replace a regular member. (same as in the proposal)\n\nFunding of Daily Rate: To limit the costs for the DAO, the additional compensation is deducted from the base compensation of the member who has requested or had to be replaced.\n\nGiantkin (Gk) as Initiate Alternate DFC Member:\n\nGk is the logical choice, as he is stepping down from his DFC member responsibilities but will still be in attendance (partly from other DAO obligations, mostly due to genuine interest).\nConditions for Activation:\n\nSteps in when the DFC fails to achieve a quorum.\nSteps in during predetermined leaves of absence of any DFC member.\nProcedures for Electing or Removing an Alternate:\n\nGovernance Action: Any DAO member can propose a governance action to either remove the current alternate or remove and nominate a new alternate. This ensures community involvement in the selection process.\nDFC Vote for Removal: The removal of an alternate can be initiated by a majority vote within the DFC. However, the DFC does not have the authority to appoint a new alternate directly.\nNomination for New Alternate: Following a removal, the Tokenomics workstream leader will request nominations/recommendations/applications for the alternate role, create a forum post / ideation process that is open to community nomination, ensuring transparency.\nBenefits:\n\nOperational Continuity: Ensures the DFC maintains operational capacity and efficiency, continuing DFC functions without interruptions.\nFlexibility and Adaptability: Responds dynamically to planned absences, keeping the decision-making process robust.\nAdditional spend: Though minimal, this would increase the spend weekly of the DFC (although it is important to note that it is still within its allotted budget, since 1 of the 5 members (the Tokenomics workstream leader) does not take compensation for their role on DFC.\nDrawbacks:\n\nPotential Underutilization: May lead to inefficiencies if the alternate role is seldom utilized.\nCompensation Limitation: Alternates are compensated a small amount relative to full members, yet are expected to stay informed and attend over 50% of meetings if possible.\nVote:\n\nFor: Supporting the creation of the alternate role and confirming Gk as the initial alternate.\n\nAgainst: Opposing the creation of the alternate role.",

      "title": "[SCP-180] DFC Committee Member addition (adding Bishop)",
      "content": "Abstract:\nThis proposal seeks to add one member to the DAO Finance Committee (DFC).\nThe DFC is currently at 5 members, with plans for GiantKin to be stepping into the role of Alternate within the DFC. This proposal would assign Bishop as the 5th member of the committee.\n\nThe compensation for this committee member is constant at $1,250 worth of FOX per month. This proposal would have a net impact of +0 worth of FOX per month (old comp of $1,250 worth of FOX no longer paid to GiantKin).\n\nSummary:\nBishop has been interviewed by the DFC in DFC meetings and has been recommended for this position by the DFC.\n\nBishop has spent 20 years working in various areas of finance working with data analytics, risk policy, risk management, fraud and loss prevention, and business intelligence In these roles, Bishop was responsible for managing a diverse risk portfolio of $5B, KPI development and management, and leading a CRM system overhaul including digital transformation . Most recently Bishop spent almost two years working with Binance US implementing risk rules and control functions, as well as directing the loss team reducing fraud activities by 30%. This was accomplished by using personal knowledge related to risk assessments of fiat to crypto transactions and system intrusion, aa well as a combination of IP risk/fraud detection, vigorous data cleaning, analysis, and iterative hypothesis testing using python. The findings were then used to create Risk Rules that were implemented within Cybersource and Tableau.\n\nIn addition to his professional experience in finance, Bishop holds a number of certifications specific to Data Analytics and Visualization, Cybersecurity, and Generative AI. The following are certifications that Bishop has obtained, the issuing authority, data obtained, expiration date, and key functionality.\n\nBuild Your Generative AI Productivity Skills with Microsoft and LinkedIn\nMicrosoft\nIssued Apr 2024\nSkills: Generative AI Tools · Prompt Engineering · Generative AI\n\nThe Power of Statistics\nGoogle via Coursera\nIssued Apr 2024\nCredential ID UUX542GYPN82\nSkills: Regression Analysis · Hypothesis Testing\n\nCertified in Cybersecurity (CC)Certified in Cybersecurity (CC)\nISC2\nIssued Oct 2023 · Expires Oct 2026Issued Oct 2023 · Expires Oct 2026\nSkills: SQL · Security Operations · Microsoft Azure · Incident Response · Information Security · Amazon Web Services (AWS) · Critical Thinking · Terraform · Business ContinuitySkills: SQL · Security Operations · Microsoft Azure · Incident Response · Information Security · Amazon Web Services (AWS) · Critical Thinking · Terraform · Business Continuity\n\nAccounting Foundations: Understanding the GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles)\nLinkedIn\nIssued Jul 2023\nShow credential\nSkills: Bank Secrecy Act · Fraud Analysis · Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) · AML · Payment Systems · U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) · Critical Thinking · Risk Control Self Assessment (RCSA)\n\nGit from Scratch\nLinkedIn\nIssued Jul 2023\nSkills: SQL · Information Security · Amazon Web Services (AWS) · Critical Thinking · Terraform\n\nTop 10 Skills for Blockchain Developers\nLinkedIn\nIssued Jul 2023\nSkills: Blockchain · Microsoft Azure · Information Security · Critical Thinking · Terraform\n\nCryptography Course Certification\nProgramming Hub Issued Mar 2023\nSkills: Data Analytics · SQL · Blockchain · Web3 · Information Security · Critical Thinking · Cryptography · Analytical Skills\n\nSolidity Certification CourseSolidity Certification Course\nProgramming Hub Issued Sep 2022\nSkills: Data Analytics · Python (Programming Language) · Solidity · SQL · Cryptocurrency · Blockchain · Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) · Web3 · Information Security · Critical Thinking · Analytical Skills · Ethereum · Terraform\n\nScrum Fundamentals Certified (SFC)\nSCRUMstudy - Accreditation Body for Scrum and Agile\nIssued Jun 2022Issued Jun 2022\nSkills: SQL · Information Security · Critical Thinking · Analytical Skills · Terraform · Risk Control Self Assessment (RCSA)\n\nAnti-Money Laundering\nQuest CE Issued May 2022\nSkills: Bank Secrecy Act · Regulatory Compliance · Fraud Analysis · AML · Payment Systems · U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) · Critical Thinking · Analytical Skills · Risk Control Self Assessment (RCSA)\n\nLean Six Sigma White Belt Certification\nSix Sigma Online; Aveta Business Institute\nIssued Apr 2022\nSkills: Scrum · Critical Thinking · Analytical Skills · Risk Control Self Assessment (RCSA)\n\nBlockchain Technology Programming Hub\nIssued Sep 2021\nSkills: Data Analytics · Python (Programming Language) · Solidity · Scrum · Defi · Cryptocurrency · Blockchain · Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) · Web3 · Information Security · Investigative Research · Critical Thinking · Analytical Skills · Ethereum · Terraform\n\nLEAN Six Sigma - GreenSky®\nIssued Jun 2016\nSkills: Critical Thinking · Analytical Skills · Risk Control Self Assessment (RCSA)\n\nBishop has recently joined the Shapeshift DAO and is eager and passionate about sharing and leveraging his knowledge of tokenization, dApp creation, risk and fraud framework with the DAO.

During the initial transition, both Bishop and GiantKin will collaborate to ensure a smooth transfer of responsibilities and knowledge. This period is crucial for Bishop to fully integrate into his new role with a clear understanding of the DFC’s ongoing and upcoming projects.\n\nAttendance Expectations:\n\n• Regular Participation: Bishop is expected to attend nearly every DFC meeting to ensure active participation and effective decision-making. Regular attendance is critical in maintaining the continuity and integrity of the DFC’s operations.\n\n• Communication of Absences: Any absence longer than one meeting must be clearly communicated in advance. This will allow sufficient time to plan and, if necessary, assign duties to an alternate member, ensuring that the DFC’s work continues uninterrupted.\n\nMotivation:\nWith GiantKin wishing to be utilized in a more limited fashion within the DFC, given his many other roles and responsibilities, we would need to replace his membership to ensure the DFC remained at 5 committee members.\n\nBenefits:\nThe passage of this proposal will ensure the DFC remains at 5 voting members. This proposal also does not add any additional spend by the DFC (net +0).\n\nDrawbacks:\n\nNo Significant Drawbacks: The transition is designed to maintain the continuity of institutional knowledge and governance effectiveness. With GiantKin transitioning to an Alternate role within the DFC, his expertise and historical insights will continue to benefit the committee. This ensures that the DFC retains his institutional knowledge while also benefiting from Bishop’s fresh perspectives and specific expertise in areas like risk management and cybersecurity.\n\nVoting:\n\nFor: Voting in favor of this proposal indicates support for the addition of Bishop to replace GiantKin as the 5th member of the DFC\n\nAgainst: Voting against this proposal signifies opposition to the changes.",

      "title": "[SCP 179]: Renewing the Operations Workstream: Aug 1 2024 - Jan 31 2025",
      "content": "Summary\n\nApproving this proposal is would signal a continuation of budget funding for another 6 month term, August 1st 2024 - January 31st, 2025 (Seventh consecutive term) for the current Operations Workstream that was established and renewed with passing of the previous proposals: [SCP-8], [SCP-59], [SCP-94], [SCP-125], [SCP-147], and [SCP- 165].\n\nThis proposal seeks to renew the Operations workstream with its current contributors, KPIs, and goals. The Operations workstream is always open and flexible to collaborative updates to future responsibilities, processes, and success metrics to continue to support the DAO as we continue to constantly evolve.\n\nThis proposal adopts [SCP-92] Definition of Workstream Leader\n\nAbstract\n\nThe Operations workstream is an integral part of the growth and development of healthy systems for reliably producing and maintaining the ShapeShift product suite and its uptime, responsiveness and feature functionality. The Operations Workstream provides front line assistance and monitoring of the products produced by the DAO in both customer support and feature testing throughout the release process. The workstream additionally provides similar support and structure to the DAO, its ecosystem, networks, and meeting structure.\n\nThrough Production Issue Procedure Best Practices, Triage Management, Deployment and Regression Testing, Customer Support and DAO Admin Procedures and Practices, the ShapeShift DAO Operations Workstream provides essential resources and tools for efficiency, organization, and overall product and services health that are vital to the success of the DAO, the product suite, it’s contributors, and $FOX token utility.\n\nMotivation\n\nRenewing this workstream will allow Operations to continue to work side by side with other workstreams to increase efficiency in individual procedural processes across the DAO and help progress deployment and testing processes while still verifying and maintaining reliability, health, and full functionality of all outlined responsibilities and services.\n\nAreas of focus and Operations responsibilities maintained by the workstream also include: Hosting the Weekly Governance call and advocating the Governance process, Organizing and hosting the quarterly AllFox community call, Marketing support and release communication, Leading and collaborating in Product specs, Weekly Release Thread updates in the forum, Expected Feature Release Testing guidelines, Go/No Gos, Retros and other coordinated meetings or DAO processes, RDP management, Gitbook documentation management,and full coverage of customer support.\n\nThe Operations workstream continues to focus on the wider picture of the product suite’s uptime, functionality, and overall health and user support. It additionally mirrors that responsibility in the DAO Discord, Github, and Notion by synergizing and coordinating cross-stream collaboration further strengthening the DAO.\n\nThis six month period will have an additional focus on building out resources and KPIs focused around error monitoring in mixpanel and functionality monitoring such as refunded trades in decentralized public resources.\n\nSpecification\n\nThe Operations workstream Notion repo can be found here.\n\nOperations maintains:\n\nTriage: Known Issues\n\n2024 Prod Issues tracking, Release Stats and testing fees,\n\nOps Sprint, Governance Call, AllFox, Go/NoGos, Retros, RDP program, Gitbook, Customer support (via Chatwoot).\n\nThe Operations Workstream strives to keep the greater DAO agile and committed to maximizing efficiency, scalability, and transparency with a strategic lean into data-based decision making. At times, best practices and procedures may be challenged, modified, updated, changed, archived or revisited to maintain those objectives. (See: The Bounty Process, Trusted Community Devs, Triage Report Tracker, Unsolved User Problems, the governance tracker, POAP minting, daily regression testing, the evolution of goat/no goats, etc)\n\nThe renewal term length for this workstream and its contributors is 6 months, from August 1st, 2024 through January 31st, 2025.\n\nThis proposal continues @Tyler | ShapeShift as the Workstream leader and @MBMaria as Operations Coordinator.\n\n@reed.thorfox has been contracted with the Workstream for hourly part time contributions as an Operations Assistant, his contributions are paid in FOX from the Operations Workstream’s saved FOX in Colony from previous terms. The compensation for this contributor is not considered in this budget in this proposal.\n\nBudget ask: $168,000 over 6 months to be sent monthly in Colony in USDC and FOX\n\n\nMonthly total budget: $28,000\n\nMonthly USDC: $19,625.20 (70%)\n\nMonthly FOX: $8,374.80 (30%)\n\n6 month USDC budget: $117,751.20\n\n6 month FOX budget: $50,248.80\n\n6 month Total budget: $168,000\n\nFull budget details\n\nThere are only two changes in this proposal from the previous proposal and both are budget line items: \\\n\nSCP 173 - ‘Updating and renewing the We FOXed up campaign for Support’ passed on March 28th, 2024, in between renewals, and is now considered part of the Monthly FOX in the Operations Workstream Budget.\nThis previously passed proposal accounts for 57% of the FOX increase in ask from the previous proposal and 25% of the total increase in ask from the previous proposal.\n\nThere is now a budget line item in contributor salaries for a ‘potential new hire.’ The compensation for this role is set at $4500/month with 25% of it in FOX. This role would allow flexibility for an additional Operations Assistant to join the team in release testing, support communication, and would allow broader coverage for the team to support expedited response times and greater ability for the team to handle vacation/sick time off.\nThis role is not guaranteed to be filled, the additional budget will only be requested in Colony upon it being filled.\n\nIf the role from 2 is not filled, there are no budget increases in this proposal that were not already approved by Governance. \\\n\nOperations would account for ~9.9% of the total DAO monthly stable spend if this proposal were to be passed:\n\nCurrent monthly USDC spend: $182,525\n\nMarketing renewal USDC increase: $1100\n\nOperations renewal USDC increase: $3,375\n\nOperations New monthly USDC spend: $19,625.20\n\nNew monthly DAO USDC spend $196,900 (If Operations and Marketing Renewals pass)\n\nThe character limit for Snapshot has been reached reached before the end of this proposal, see forum post for the rest of the proposal: https://forum.shapeshift.com/t/rfc-renewing-the-operations-workstream-aug-2024-jan-31-2025/3067",

      "title": "SCP 178 - Renew MKBD Workstream August 1 - February 1 2025",
      "content": "Abstract/Summary\n================\n\nThis proposal seeks to renew and expand the ShapeShift DAO's MKBD Workstream for the next six months, starting August 1, 2024 and ending February 1.\n\nThe ShapeShift DAO relies on the MKBD workstream to:\n\n-   Finalize and assist with product copywriting\n\n-   Lead and foster partnerships and co-marketing opportunities\n\n-   ABM (account-based marketing)\n\n-   Develop onchain + offchain user profiles and audience segments\n\n-   Global translations in-app and on marketing pages\n\n-   Own shapeshift.com, optimize inbound traffic and discovery of app's products\n\n-   Spearhead community development\n\n-   GTM strategy and execution as it pertains to the DAO and its products holistically\n\n-   Asset creation, maintenance, and ownership of the ShapeShift Brand\n\n-   IRL event planning + management\n\n-   Grants (as needed, scoped, and resourced additionally by the DAO)\n\nThis proposal adopts SCP-92 Definition of Workstream Leader.\n\nMotivation\n==========\n\nTo continue to provide the DAO the needed marketing resourcing and support for growing adoption and awareness of the current and future product offering while owning the tasks listed above.\n\n-   MKBD secured a grant from Optimism generating 59,627.57 OP tokens (obo $106,733 at time of writing) that were sent directly to the DAO's treasury. Grants will be put on the back burner unless greenlit by product and engineering or otherwise noted.\n\n-   MKBD secured $18k of RUNE (at ~$6) which was has been agreed to but not yet sent to the DAO's RUNE address in exchange for OOH spots at Rare Evo.\n\n-   We additionally secured [$3500 from Gitcoin Grants](https://explorer.gitcoin.co/?utm_source=grants.gitcoin.co&utm_medium=internal_link&utm_campaign=gg19&utm_content=program-rounds#/round/42161/25/152),\n\nSpecification\n=============\n\nTeam\n\nHpayne 一 Full Time 一 Workstream Lead\n\n[Twells](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15NPLYAwEhmYZ4NnzHFF_TMlGAKDNnl--Wf0En4rooqY/edit?usp=sharing) 一 Full Time 一 Marketing Communications Manager\n\n[TheSmith](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ghaUM3NJ-Pv6eBe-0ObXs5lnTbWxBcUDhqRTdrcyS8I/edit?usp=sharing) 一 Full Time 一 Webmaster and Marketing Manager\n\nAtlan 一 Full Time 一 Lead designer\n\n[Firebomb](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DEpf0Tn-WSdffwL0tNVkxJppmngB5oRw5reJZP3XIzM/edit) 一 Part Time 一 International UX & Translations lead\n\n[NFThinker](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16maYNfiLwlNrZAfztrt2ysMIvq3bB7_AMP55W0kuN4g/edit?usp=sharing) 一 Part Time 一 X Spaces and Partner Management\n\n[Sapote](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1s6VF1xwIr7C9NY2xHQPxNxu9ox--okvKnMN0ObnHgQ4/edit) 一 Part Time 一 Independent Data Analyst contractor\n\nHoff 一 Part Time 一 Web Designer\n\nMandate\n\nThe MKBD Workstream is the sole maintainer of ShapeShift.com, X, and any other official marketing accounts pertaining to the DAO or its activities. The .com account shall be controlled by the Fox Foundation until it is handed off to the DAO.\n\nThis is to ensure the DAO maintains a high standard and consistent perception of branding, messaging, and the products holistically.\n\nThe MKBD Workstream will spearhead partner engagement and collaboration in addition to acting as stewards for the ShapeShift FOX communities to usher product usage, awareness, and adoption.\n\nBudget spreadsheet\\\nThe details below expand upon the budget spreadsheet:\n\n[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10bytuaPdC7WeNsbIOYpSaFcW2dgzv00oKh51ZS\\_a5_o/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10bytuaPdC7WeNsbIOYpSaFcW2dgzv00oKh51ZS%5C_a5_o/edit?usp=sharing)\n\nTLDR:\n\n-   6-month total ask: $246,000\n\n-   Returning 297,000 FOX to the DAO treasury (value at the time of posting: obo $16,000)\n\n-   Absorbing $2500/mo contributor expense from Product (Hoff) (6-month total: $15,000)\n\n-   Total additional ask from the treasury compared to last 6-month term (increase ask ($24,750) - returned FOX - absorbed product contributor): -$6,250 ($1,041 less spent per month over six months)\n\nFor reference, here is the previous workstream renewal budget:\n\n<https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QoQKcd_gBHiCk9Qrg-7FDlSXC92mfg5D72Rc_Ui5iYs/edit?usp=sharing>\n\nTotal requested over 6-months: $246,000 + $46,200 FOX\n\nThe amount of additional FOX requested will be locked on August 7, 2024 by using a 7-day daily-VWAP calculated by taking the daily mid-price (Low + High / 2), multiplied by that day's volume averaged over 7 days using data from CoinMarketCap.\n\n<https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/fox-token/historical-data/>. The intended use of this FOX is discussed below.\n\nA separate governance proposal shall be raised if the MKBD Workstream requires more funding.\n\nThe increase in spend aside from moving Hoff from Product to Marketing covers the increased scope of running and managing X spaces, increasing onchain <> offchain ABM activities, financially incentivizing top talent to stay, and managing the webflow instance of ShapeShift.\n\nRecurring costs\n\nLabor\n\nThe marketing workstream lead (Hpayne) fully adopts SCP-92 in this proposal.\n\nThe budget currently retains the four existing full-time marketers and three part-time contributors from the previous workstream, plus one additional part-time contractor (Sapote) who will assist with Data Management.\n\nAny unused funds from any budget category will be kept in the workstream Colony and rolled over into the following proposal.\n\nFox Compensation\n\nIf the MKBD team meets specific KPIs surrounding community growth, marketing campaign execution, and partner activations, all full-time and part-time contributors (and part-time contractors) explicitly stated in the budget spreadsheet above who maintained or increased their level of engagement in the the workstream for the duration of the budget cycle (6 months) will receive a 20% bonus in FOX that will be paid out evenly over the following 6 months starting February 1, 2025. Any member of the team who leaves or is terminated before January 31, 2025, will not be eligible for this incentive.\n\nThe price of FOX used for this calculation will be the reference price mentioned above.\n\nMKBD team members may opt for any additional amount of their stable compensation as FOX.\n\nKPIs for the team to qualify:\n\n-   Drive $50,000 of partner sponsorship co-marketing or grant funding (to be sent to the DAO)\n\n-   Last term: $128,000 obo\n\nReporting\n\nThe workstream will host bi-weekly office hours for the community and post slides and recordings to the forum biweekly. If the community has additional reporting requests, the workstream is happy to consider them and ensure visibility and transparency.\n\nDrawbacks\n=========\n\nUSDC and FOX spend.\n\nBenefits\n========\n\nThis proposal ensures continuity of the existing MKBD team with retention incentives to ensure our team continues to perform and expand responsibilities. The MKBD effort markets, grows, and sells the ShapeShift product while retaining, strengthening, and enhancing the voice and brand image and driving value through the product. We exist to scale and proliferate the ShapeShift product while creating pockets of power users and community members.\n\nVote\n\nFor - Formalizes the community is \"for\" the details outlined in this proposal\n\nAgainst - Formalizes the community is \"against\" the proposal",

      "content": "Summary:\nThis proposal seeks to update the current ThorFOX/RFOX tokenomics to allow staking not only with FOX tokens on Arbitrum but also with FOX/ETH Uniswap V2 LP tokens on Arbitrum. This change aims to enhance liquidity provisioning, strengthening the FOX ecosystem.\n\nAbstract:\nThis proposal is a minor update to SCP-166 ThorFOX, which established a mechanism by which DAO tokenholders can stake their FOX tokens and receive a share of the RUNE affiliate fees. This proposal aims to update the ThorFOX/RFOX tokenomics to allow staking with FOX/ETH Uniswap V2 LP tokens on ARB, thereby strengthening the DAO’s alignment with the THORChain ecosystem. \n\nThis initial vote will set the parameter to 0% of total RUNE fee distribution but allow for the inclusion of a token outside of the FOX token on Arbitrum.\n\nMotivation:\nThe primary motivation for this proposal is to ensure that the ThorFOX/RFOX program is beneficial to the DAO while providing more options for the stakers and DAO token holders. By enabling staking with FOX/ETH Uniswap V2 LP tokens, we can enhance liquidity provisioning on both mainnet and Arbitrum, thereby supporting both ecosystems.\n\nSpecification:\nThis minor update to SCP-166 only alters the portion of the proposal which details the tokens allowed for staking that are then eligible to receive a portion of the monthly RUNE affiliate fees distributed to stakers. This would allow pro rata bucketing before any split of the revenues. This proposal does not specify the mechanics how LP stakers would be rewarded. If passed, a subsequent SCP will be discussed as to how this split would be implemented. \n\nIf passed, this proposal would implement the same 28-day unstaking period.\n\nIf passed, this proposal would implement the default that characteristics should be identical when possible for the LP token treasury remission/staking/burning protocols.\n\nIf passed, this proposal would implement the following changes:\n\nStaking with FOX/ETH Uniswap V2 LP Tokens: In addition to FOX tokens on ARB, rfox/ThorFOX as a program would technically be accept FOX/ETH Uniswap V2 LP tokens.\n\n\nBenefits:\n\nMultichain Yield: Incentivize liquidity with RUNE, a different chain’s native token.\nEvergreen Contract: Once proven on Arbitrum, this model may replace the FOX Farm Rewards contract on mainnet.\nEnhanced Liquidity: Accepting FOX/ETH Uniswap V2 LP tokens for staking will improve liquidity.\nStronger Alignment with THORChain: This update reinforces the DAO’s commitment to the THORChain ecosystem.\nIncreased Flexibility for Stakers: More options for earning yield.\n\nDrawbacks:\n\nEngineering Work: This update will require effort from the engineering and product teams to implement and maintain.\nComplexity in Yield Distribution: Determining how to distribute affiliate fees among different types of staked tokens may add complexity.\n\n\nVote:\n\nFor: Enact the proposed changes to accept FOX/ETH Uniswap V2 LP tokens for staking.\nAgainst: No changes will be made to the current tokenomics.",

      "title": "(SCP 176) Moderation Workstream Renewal Jul -Dec 2024",
      "content": "2024 Jul-Dec Moderation Workstream Renewal\nSummary\n\nThe Community Moderation Workstream is primarily responsible to support the community and to maintain the integrity of all ShapeShift various platforms such as Discord, The Forum, and Notion, snapshot, and any/all others. Future platforms that the community chooses to implement also to be included. This workstream is used daily to ensure the smooth operation of the ShapeShift DAO.\n\nThis proposal is to renew the Moderation Workstream, re-elect Giantkin as leader and fund the workstream through the end of Jun 2024.\n\nTotal Ask is $11600/month. (unchanged)\n\nNormal USDC monthly is $6410 (depending on Fox choice, April 202 $5820 for example) some of which is for licenses/botspends that stay in ws treasury, and if unused per term, set aside as possible (small)bounty item, roll over to next Term (stays in Moderation subtreasury until dissolved, bountied, or too large - then revert to Treasury.\n\nCharter\nDuring the proposal run, if at any time Moderation lead needs to leave (or be asked to leave)\n\nthe Leaders group can force vote out the Moderation lead (or put leader on hold). No other method. (voluntary step down, and hand off being ideal)\n\nTemp position given to other mod members, number 2 first would be put in ‘charge’ until lead returns, or a new lead is voted in.\nHiring/firing is solely based on the Moderation leads decision. Based on discussions, Total amount for proposal will be listed, without breakdown, in proposal, but in other places instead.\nAbstract\n\nModeration supports all workstreams and all users within each of the platforms it moderates. As we bring more members into the various platforms, moderators act as so much more than bot managers and spam blockers. Not only do the moderators set up the verification process, they are the point of contact for members having issues with the verification process. They function as the greeters of the DAO, if you will. Our team of moderators clears the path for new members, new contributors and new supporters by facilitating a fluid user experience. Enthusiastic about all things defi and crypto, empowering community members, new and old alike, on their journey to self-empowered entrepreneurism.\n\nMotivation\n\nThe mission of this workstream is simple: to help people. Moderation is the workstream you never knew you needed, but couldn’t live without. From welcoming new users to setting up calls to managing bots. Moderation is here to support the community. This workstream strives to create a space that fosters security, growth and innovation.\n\nOur team of trustworthy, confident and enthusiastic moderators allows for decentralization of community moderation. This may address the point of preventing accusations of vested interest, since only community elected mods have the power to preserve and maintain the DAO culture.\n\nAs the workstream leader, I want to make the user feel like they are able to relax. Users are most likely talking from their home space, home usually means they feel safe. I want to keep that feeling in our group.\n\nSpecification\n\nModerators take on wide variety of tasks, including but not limited to:\n\nOrganize user flow via roles, channels and bots\nCreate and maintain scheduled events in sesh & Discord\nProvide protection from scammers\nWarn abusers (strike system established by Giantkin)\nProviding basic Discord support\nFacilitating ‘temps’ for a job, for example, providing the DJ with a role for the event\nHelp maintain and update server images such as avatars, stickers, emojis, etc. (Emptyslot)\nProvide security support (live when possible) for meetings and community events\nDrive users to the proper channels\nContinually monitoring channels, and other server banlists for potential spam/scammers and adding them into our banlist\nTaking part in Support/Ops triage process by shuttling members requesting support to the proper channels, connecting with self help resources, #support,chatwoot, etc as appropriate\nAppropriate use of Admin Power by Moderation Workstream Leader\nWork with Admins to facilitate bots/webhooks/roles/channels/categories -servers/platforms etc\nEnforce the Current Code of Conduct to the best of ability, with positive intent.\nWhat are the goals of this workstream?\n\nProvide 12 hour moderation coverage to ShapeShift DAO’s community channels, with the eventual goal to provide 24 hour coverage\nProactively ban 90% of scammers/bots that try to sneak into ShapeShift discord\nEnsure that all community meetings are scheduled on the calendar\nThe Moderation Workstream is successful when you don’t notice that it’s there.\nDuring the Jul - Dec 2023 term, the Moderation Workstream has accomplished the following:\n\nSustainability updates to server roles and channels\nFew problems known.\nTested, added removed tools reporting bots (boardroom vs snapshot for example)\nGated bot installs with higher perms than needed.\ninstalled tested Galxe,zealy, and guild bot setups.\nsetup missions for all 3bots above. galxe-giuld bot have interconnected missions (see global)\noverwatched forum setup, and growth.\nwatched 14,000+ users in discord!\nAdded Websupport, for Support use and testing. (removed websupport for rethink)\nSetup Discord ‘Forum’ threads for Stage Events and other meetings. (works great!)\nOther items not included but taken on\nMonthly Foxpayout for contributors: maintain and update sheet monthly. Facilitate payout for WS and other groups, as needed/requested : remind WSleaders to update contributors Choice(s), and update their tab. Work with Willy to get things done as timely as possible. -update the fox price on a set schedule/method.\nPraise steward. push for others to use. (slow process!)\naudio record primary meetings - office hours\nJump into our partners Discords to help setup a basic security process, to help protect our users there.\nColony overseer\nBenefits\n\nKeeps the discord clear of spammers\nLimits the Scammers on server\nDrawbacks\n\nGrowing member list, growing expense.",

      "title": "SCP-175 Engineering Workstream Renewal: April 1 - Sept 30 2024",
      "content": "Abstract / Overview\nThis proposal is to continue to fund the Engineering Workstream’s budget for 6 months, April 1st, 2024 through Sept 30th, 2024.\n\nThe ShapeShift DAO relies on the Engineering Workstream to maintain the code base, undertake core engineering work to enable new features, and to provide architectural oversight and technical leadership as we continue to execute the roadmap as defined by the Community and Product Workstream.\n\nMotivation\nTo continue to provide the DAO the needed engineering resources to maintain the existing product offering and implement new functionality.\n\nSpecification\nTeam\n0xean https://github.com/0xean - Interim Workstream Leader (dependent on the passing of SCP-174)\n\n0xApotheosis https://github.com/0xApotheosis - Senior Engineer\n\ngomes https://github.com/gomesalexandre - Senior Engineer\n\nkaladinlight https://github.com/kaladinlight - Senior Engineer\n\nwoodenfurniture https://github.com/woodenfurniture - Senior Engineer\n\nTo be hired - Senior Engineer\n\nMandate\nNo changes to mandate. See previous renewal. https://snapshot.org/#/shapeshiftdao.eth/proposal/0x306dd79215c8463a59db06d3d2fd25cb3111b1305a62fe0bc16eda8a515c84ee\n\nBudget\nThe details below expand upon the budget spreadsheet https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xZvbLeVnkNssY8SxH7GRfh0vbGX6x80erZW4T1jU66U/edit?usp=sharing (for reference, here is the previous workstream renewal’s budget https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lS0dA32rYdEpKnxOGKhSqs3ba7ffHtgX-nIKdvEDJIM/edit#gid=550583440 )\n\nTotal amount requested over 6 month: $524,700 + $95,000 USD in FOX\n\nThe amount of FOX requested will be locked in on Apr 7, 2024 by using a 7 day daily-VWAP calculated by taking the daily mid price (Low + High / 2), multiplied by that day’s volume averaged over 7 days using data from CoinMarketCap https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/fox-token/historical-data/ . The intended use of this FOX is discussed below.\n\nRecurring costs\nLabor\n\nThe budget currently retains the 4 existing engineers from the previous workstream. In addition to the existing team, the budget adds room for an additional hire to be made over the next 6 months. There is no compensation for a workstream leader built into this budget as a new WS leader will need to be ratified by governance and can negotiate compensation at that time.\n\nInfrastructure\n\nThese costs are currently being paid by the Foundation and are not included in the workstream’s budget but are managed by the workstream.\n\nNon-recurring costs\nMiscellaneous\n\nThe budget contains a line item for $10,000 USDC of discretionary funds which may be used for travel, conferences, retreats etc, at engineering’s discretion.\n\nThe line item above is provisional, and any unspent funds will be returned to the DAO.\n\nContingency\n\nUnforeseen costs will arise and 10% of the USDC subtotal is requested accordingly.\n\nThe budget seeks approval for $49,500 for contingency to be spent judiciously at the workstream’s discretion, shall it be required.\n\nVariance\n\nUnused funds from any budget category will be returned to the DAO at the end of the budget cycle.\n\nIn the event that the Engineering Workstream requires more funds, a separate governance proposal shall be raised.\n\nFox Compensation\nAll engineers who remain engaged full-time with the workstream for the duration of the budget cycle (6 months) will receive a 20% bonus in FOX that will be paid out evenly over the following 6 months starting October 1, 2024. Any engineer who leaves or is terminated before Sept 30 2024, will not be eligible for this incentive. For any newly hired engineer, the discretion of how to fairly pro-rate this is left to the discretion of the workstream leader.\n\nThe price of FOX used for this calculation will be the reference price mentioned above.\n\nEngineers may opt for any additional amount of their stable compensation as FOX.\n\nReporting\nThe workstream will continue to post monthly updates ( https://forum.shapeshift.com/t/engineering-workstream-monthly-update-jan-2024/2898 , https://forum.shapeshift.com/t/engineering-workstream-monthly-update-feb-2024/2945 , https://forum.shapeshift.com/t/engineering-workstream-monthly-update-march-2024/2981 ) to the community published to the forum and provide visibility into its work on GitHub (project boards, issues, and pull requests). If the community has additional requests for reporting, the workstream is happy to consider them and ensure that there is visibility and transparency.\n\nInterim leader\n0xean will act as interim leader of the workstream but the DAO is encouraged to find and elect another more permanent workstream leader who will replace him as soon as possible.\n\nBenefits\nEnsures continuity of the existing engineering team with retention incentives to ensure our small team doesn’t grow smaller.\nAdds additional budget to grow the workstream as market conditions and DAO revenues improve.\nDrawbacks\nUSDC and FOX spend\nNo permanent workstream leader\nThe team is definitely resource constrained and may need to consider scaling beyond a single individual in the near future.",

      "title": "SCP-174 Retain Foundation Engineering Workstream Support",
      "content": "Summary\n\nThis proposal seeks community alignment formalizing the request of 0xeans interim Engineering Workstream Leadership until October 1st or until a permanent replacement is selected via governance. This request aims to ensure continuity, stability, and effectiveness within the engineering workstream in light of challenges attracting qualified candidates.\n\nAbstract\n\nGiven the resignation of 0xdef1cafe as the Engineering Workstream Leader in the fall, plus the challenges faced in attracting qualified applicants, 0xean from the Fox Foundation, has stepped in, filling the gap. Per all measures he’s done so with remarkable success. Passing this proposal signals a request of the Fox Foundation extending assistance filling the engineering workstream leader role until either Oct 1st or such a time when governance has selected a permanent replacement. Should a competent leader emerge they will put a proposal for a change in leadership and a revised scope of work as needed.\n\nMotivation\n\nThe engineering team, alongside operations and product workstreams, have unanimously found the support provided from the Fox Foundation for an interim engineering workstream leader  highly beneficial. The workstream’s budget is [up for renewal at the end of March](https://snapshot.org/#/shapeshiftdao.eth/proposal/0x306dd79215c8463a59db06d3d2fd25cb3111b1305a62fe0bc16eda8a515c84ee). As the search for a replacement workstream leader continues and since the likelihood of a suitable leader passing through governance in time for the team’s renewal, the need for an alternate solution is clear. This proposal not only addresses the immediate need for effective leadership but also leverages the unique position of the Foundation providing service for the DAO, leading a DAO workstream towards better outcomes. \n\nSpecification\n\nA passing vote signals a community ratified request to the Foundation for 0xean’s Engineering Leadership services. Like SCP 161, 0xean will continue as the interim Engineering Workstream Leader. This proposal formalizes the request under the following conditions:\n- 0xean will remain as the interim Engineering Workstream Leader until the community elects a permanent replacement or until October 1st, whichever comes first.\n- 0xean has voluntarily recused himself from the committee who has been working to vet a new workstream leader in order to avoid conflicts of interest.\n- 0xean will take no compensation directly from the DAO and is compensated through his role at the foundation\n\nBenefits\n\n- Retains Engineering: As the timeline for a new budget is approaching this proposal ensures that there will be no break retaining the contributors and talent on the engineering workstream.\n- Leadership Continuity: Provides uninterrupted and effective leadership for the Engineering Workstream during a critical period.\n- Operational Stability: Ensures the Engineering Workstream continues to function efficiently and effectively under proven leadership.\nSupports the DAO's: By subsidizing this specific role through the Foundation the runway is preserved for longer. \n\nDrawbacks\n\n- Lack of DAO recruited leader: While essential under current circumstances, retaining foundation member services in operational roles is a temporary accommodation. It still leaves the workstream without a permanent leader.\n- Focus on Permanent Recruitment: Emphasizes the need to continue efforts to identify and recruit a permanent Engineering Workstream Leader.\n\nVote\n\n- For: Approval to formalize 0xean as the interim Engineering Workstream Leader until October 1st or until a permanent replacement is elected by governance.\n- Against: Opposition to the proposal, rejecting the formalization of 0xean's interim leadership role.\n- For, with changes: (Ideation Stage Only) Indicates support for the proposal if certain adjustments are made before the final vote.\n\nFor further discussion or to express any questions, comments, or concerns, please comment below or reach out in the #Governance channel of the ShapeShift Discord.",

      "content": "Summary\n\nThis proposal seeks community alignment formalizing the request of 0xeans interim Engineering Workstream Leadership until October 1st or until a permanent replacement is selected via governance. This request aims to ensure continuity, stability, and effectiveness within the engineering workstream in light of challenges attracting qualified candidates.\n\nAbstract\n\nGiven the resignation of 0xdef1cafe as the Engineering Workstream Leader in the fall, plus the challenges faced in attracting qualified applicants, 0xean from the Fox Foundation, has stepped in, filling the gap. Per all measures he’s done so with remarkable success. Passing this proposal signals a request of the Fox Foundation extending assistance filling the engineering workstream leader role until either Oct 1st or such a time when governance has selected a permanent replacement. Should a competent leader emerge they will put a proposal for a change in leadership and a revised scope of work as needed.\n\nMotivation\n\nThe engineering team, alongside operations and product workstreams, have unanimously found the support provided from the Fox Foundation for an interim engineering workstream leader  highly beneficial. The workstream’s budget is [up for renewal at the end of March](https://snapshot.org/#/shapeshiftdao.eth/proposal/0x306dd79215c8463a59db06d3d2fd25cb3111b1305a62fe0bc16eda8a515c84ee). As the search for a replacement workstream leader continues and since the likelihood of a suitable leader passing through governance in time for the team’s renewal, the need for an alternate solution is clear. This proposal not only addresses the immediate need for effective leadership but also leverages the unique position of the Foundation providing service for the DAO, leading a DAO workstream towards better outcomes. \n\nSpecification\n\nA passing vote signals a community ratified request to the Foundation for 0xean’s Engineering Leadership services. Like SCP 161, 0xean will continue as the interim Engineering Workstream Leader. This proposal formalizes the request under the following conditions:\n- 0xean will remain as the interim Engineering Workstream Leader until the community elects a permanent replacement or until October 1st, whichever comes first.\n- 0xean has voluntarily recused himself from the committee who has been working to vet a new workstream leader in order to avoid conflicts of interest.\n- 0xean will take no compensation directly from the DAO and is compensated through his role at the foundation\n\nBenefits\n\n- Retains Engineering: As the timeline for a new budget is approaching this proposal ensures that there will be no break retaining the contributors and talent on the engineering workstream.\n- Leadership Continuity: Provides uninterrupted and effective leadership for the Engineering Workstream during a critical period.\n- Operational Stability: Ensures the Engineering Workstream continues to function efficiently and effectively under proven leadership.\nSupports the DAO's: By subsidizing this specific role through the Foundation the runway is preserved for longer. \n\nDrawbacks\n\n- Lack of DAO recruited leader: While essential under current circumstances, retaining foundation member services in operational roles is a temporary accommodation. It still leaves the workstream without a permanent leader.\n- Focus on Permanent Recruitment: Emphasizes the need to continue efforts to identify and recruit a permanent Engineering Workstream Leader.\n\nVote\n\n- For: Approval to formalize 0xean as the interim Engineering Workstream Leader until October 1st or until a permanent replacement is elected by governance.\n- Against: Opposition to the proposal, rejecting the formalization of 0xean's interim leadership role.\n- For, with changes: (Ideation Stage Only) Indicates support for the proposal if certain adjustments are made before the final vote.\n\nFor further discussion or to express any questions, comments, or concerns, please comment below or reach out in the #Governance channel of the ShapeShift Discord.",

This campaign was in practice last at the DAO under the previous Support Workstream for 4 months before the wallet storing the funds was compromised and drained 1.\n\nAs Operations has inherited support responsibilities at the DAO, there have been a small number of edge cases discovered where users have had unnecessary transaction failures, or refunds of trades that were due to bugs in ShapeShift’s code and not the protocols integrated. Operations hopes to revisit the previous ‘We FOXed up’ campaign with Operations security best practices and sybil resistant tracking and monitoring of all claims and refunds.\n\nThe recent passing of the Operations Workstream renewal comes with the smallest and most conservative budget it has ever had with only room to refund users from the monthly test fund budget currently allocated for the whole DAO. The renewal states:\n\n“If network conditions or the price of FOX decreasing dramatically alters or changes Operations ability to perform required deployment and regression testing, an additional proposal addendum for test funds may be proposed.”\n\nWhile this request is not specifically for test funds, it would have ultimately been deducted from DAO test funds and could trigger an Operations test fund increase proposal if not supported in an individual proposal here.\n\n‘We FOXed up’ budget can additionally be used to incentivize, retain, and/or show appreciation for users that provide feature requests, have unexpected experiences with ShapeShift, or have an experience with the platform, DAO, or support that is worth recognition or acknowledgement with a little FOX.\n\nMotivation:\n\nCurrently if a user performs a Thorchain trade that fails due to slippage or market movement and they were assessed an affiliate fee for using ShapeShift, that user is not refunded the affiliate fee as a feature of the protocol. ShapeShift still collects that fee but the user is issued a refund minus the gas used to broadcast transactions and the affiliate fee ShapeShift will collect later.\n\nIn edge cases like this or numerous others where a user can provide blockchain evidence that a ShapeShift built action caused a failure in a transaction, unnecessary gas fees, excessive unnecessary approvals, or any other blockchain related failure or reversion, ShapeShift has the evidence necessary to verify and validate if a user is owed a refund.\n\nBeing leaders in non-custodial services comes with ‘use at your own risk’ warning labels. While this proposal does not supersede any of those sentiments, terms or policies previously put in place, it does allow the DAO to provide a better user experience and retention tool as a resource via support where it previously did not.\n\nSpecification:\n\nThis proposal requests an addition of $1500 in FOX per month to be added to the current Operations Workstream budget. All unused funds will roll over and accumulate. Any unused funds may be returned to the DAO at the end of the Operations term or rolled over in a renewal.\n\nRefund tracking and management will be able to be viewed in the Operations Notion page tracking all eligible refunds as well as users who have received FOX as a retention tool.\n\nFunds will be sent monthly and stored in the Operations Workstream Colony address and withdrawn/converted only when a refund is required.\nRefunds and FOX incentivization transactions are to be solely administered by the Operations Workstream Leader from the DAO Operations test funds wallet.\nTracking information for every transaction includes on-chain transactions of the exchange in question, support tickets, date, amounts, and TXIDs of refunds.\nRefunds will always be sent in the native asset and asset amount to the sending address provable from the blockchain link of the problem transaction(s) in question.\nGas fees for failed transactions deserving a refund can be additionally tracked and refunded at Operations discretion.\nTerms of Service can still be applied to any specific user issue and this proposal passing does not guarantee refunds to any failure.\nSlippage and natural market conditions that can cause transaction failure are not viewed as caused by ShapeShift.\nUsers or addresses caught attempting to abuse or game any refund program will be exempt from future refunds.\n\nBenefits\n\nThe major benefit to this proposal is in potential user retention of users that have a bad experience in ShapeShift.

      "title": "[Ideation] SCP-172 DFC: Expand or Alternate?",
      "content": "## Summary\n\nThis document presents two governance proposals to enhance the DAO Finance Committee (DFC) structure: A) expanding its membership or B) introducing an alternate member role. Additionally, it proposes compensation adjustments for workstream leaders outside of the Tokenomics Workstream.\n\n## Abstract\n\nWith the recent expansion and clarity of the DFC's mandate AND the renewed interest in DFC membership, there is a need to source opinions/thoughts on how we might want to adjust the DFCs operational framework to ensure effective financial governance.\n\nFor this reason, I propose we do one of the following: a) increase the committee size for broader expertise or b) establish an alternate member role for governance continuity.\n\nLastly, as the TMDC evolved into the DFC, the rigor desired and deliverables required of individual DFC members has increased substantively. To align with these additional workloads, this proposal also recommends compensation adjustments for anyone besides the Tokenomics Workstream Leader, to reflect their integral role in the DAO's operations.\n\n## Motivation\n\nThe expansion of the DFC and the introduction of an alternate member are motivated by the committee's increased responsibilities and renewed interest by the community. These structural changes aim to fortify the DAO's financial governance framework and facilitate better, more data-driven, and more critically thought out decision-making processes.. Parallelly, recognizing the contributions of DFC members through fair compensation is crucial for sustaining high-level engagement and acknowledgment of their efforts.\n\n## Specification\n\n### Proposal A: Expansion to Seven Members and Compensation Adjustment\n\n- **Expansion**: Increase DFC membership to seven.\n\n- **Compensation for New Members**: Each new member, including those currently on the DFC (excluding Tokenomics Workstream leader), will receive a monthly compensation of 1250 USD worth of FOX tokens.\n\n- **Total Impact**: With the addition of two more members under this proposal, the total monthly compensation impact would be +3750 USD worth of FOX tokens.\n\n### Proposal B: Establishment of an Alternate Member and Compensation Adjustment\n\n- **Alternate Member Role**: Introduce an alternate member who is compensated and steps in under specific conditions (to be voted on by the DAO if this option should pass).\n\n- **Compensation for Alternate Member**: The alternate will receive 750 USD worth of FOX tokens monthly for their readiness and contribution.\n\n- **Possible Conditions for Alternate Member**: The alternate would be able to step in as a full voting member of the DFC in one of the three following circumstances (or any other described/discussed in the forum comments below):\n\n1. Steps in when the DFC fails to achieve a quorum (currently quorum is 3)\n2. Steps in when the DFC fails to achieve full membership that day (5 members total)\n3. Steps in when a DFC member has an extended leave of absence (either planned for or unexpected)\n\n  1. When planned for, the duration would be set by the member absent\n  2. When unexpected, the alternate member would step in at the 2nd/3rd meeting of which the unavailable DFC member has missed, and will remain until either\n\n      a) The unavailable/absent DFC member returns\n      b) The Tokenomics Workstream Leader puts a proposal forth (starting the process no later than 10 days after the first absence) to add the first alternate as a member, and elect a new first alternate.\n\n- **Total Impact**: This proposal's adoption would result in an additional monthly expenditure of +2000 USD worth of FOX tokens considering the alternate's compensation and the change to reinstate previously foregone compensation for any member (with the exception of the Tokenomics workstream lead)\n\n## Benefits\n\n#### Benefits of Proposal A\n\n- **Enhanced Decision-Making Capacity**: Expanding the DFC to seven members introduces a wider array of perspectives and expertise, potentially leading to more robust and well-rounded financial decisions.\n\n- **Increased Operational Capability**: With more members, the DFC can manage a broader scope of responsibilities, better reflecting its expanded mandate and ensuring that all areas of financial governance are adequately covered.\n\n- **Recognition of Contribution**: The proposed compensation recognizes the importance and value of the DFC members' contributions, aiding in retention and motivation.\n\n#### Benefits of Proposal B\n\n- **Operational Continuity**: The alternate member ensures that the DFC can maintain quorum and continue its governance functions without interruption, even in the absence of one or more members.\n\n- **Flexibility and Responsiveness**: This setup allows for a more flexible and responsive governance structure, capable of adapting to unforeseen circumstances or absences.\n\n- **Cost-Efficiency**: Although there is an additional cost, this model is more cost-effective than expanding the committee permanently.\n\n## Drawbacks\n\n#### Drawbacks of Proposal A\n\n- **Higher Financial Commitment**: The additional compensation for new members increases the DAO's financial outlay, impacting its budget.\n\n- **Complexity in Coordination and Consensus**: With more members, coordinating meetings and reaching consensus may become more challenging, potentially slowing down the decision-making process.\n\n#### Drawbacks of Proposal B\n\n- **Limited Increase in Perspectives**: While an alternate member can maintain operational continuity, this approach does not expand the diversity of expertise and perspective as significantly as adding more permanent members.\n\n- **Potential Underutilization**: If the conditions for the alternate member to step in are infrequent, there could be periods where the compensation does not correspond to active contribution, leading to inefficiencies.\n\n- **Complexity in Role Transition**: The conditions under which the alternate member becomes active and reverts to their non-active role can introduce complexity, requiring clear guidelines and potentially complicating governance dynamics.\n\n## Vote\n\nDAO members are called upon to vote on the following aspects:\n\n- **For Proposal A (Expansion and Compensation Adjustment)**: Support for increasing the DFC to seven members with corresponding compensation adjustments, resulting in a total impact of +3750 USD in FOX tokens monthly.\n\n- **For Proposal B (Alternate Member and Compensation Adjustment)**: Endorsement of establishing an alternate member role with a compensation scheme, alongside adjustments for workstream leaders, totaling an additional +2000 USD in FOX tokens monthly.\n\n- **For Proposal A with changes (please list below in forum)\n\n- **For Proposal B with changes (please list below in forum)\n\n- **Against**: Preference for maintaining the current DFC structure and compensation model, without the proposed expansions or adjustments.",

      "title": "SCP-170 Treasury Management and Diversification Committee (TMDC) Mandate Update & Rename into DAO Finance Committee (DFC)",
      "content": "## Summary\nThis proposal seeks to reform the existing Treasury Management and Diversification Committee (TMDC) by expanding its mandate and renaming it to DAO Finance Committee (DFC). This proposal also updates the procedures & policies of the DFC.\nThe new mandate includes explicit management of discounts/fees/promotion details from previous and future governance proposals, management of all future grants & non-FOX token revenue to any of the DAO's wallets on any chain increasing the oversight of token allocation from 180M FOX to encompass all grants & non-FOX token revenue from the passing of this proposal onwards. This proposal would explicitly prohibit capricious or speculative uses of both the 180M FOX and future grant/non-FOX token revenue. This proposal would set policies and procedures for adding agenda items, removing DFC members, and appointing interim members when below quorum.\n\n\n## Abstract\nAs discussed in [SCP-148] and [SCP-77], the TMDC has been pivotal in \"advising on the allocation over certain limited assets within the ShapeShift treasury\" and \"managing the treasury to meet payroll and operating expenses with stablecoins each month\"​​. Building upon this solid foundation, the proposed DFC aims to integrate a more holistic approach by including fee management and all grants & non-FOX token revenue, ensuring a comprehensive treasury, revenue, and financial health approach. \n\n## Proposal Details\n\n### Mandate Expansion and Renaming: \nThe TMDC will be rebranded as the DAO Finance Committee (DFC), with an extended mandate to oversee a broader array of financial responsibilities. This includes:\n- **Management of Discount Fee Parameters**: From governance proposals.\n- **Oversight of All Future Grants and Non-FOX Token Revenues**: Across all DAO wallets and chains.\n- **Enhanced Reporting**: On DAO's financial health and strategic recommendations for financial sustainability.\n\n### Definition of Specific Powers & Limitations\n- **Asset Management**: Selling assets for stablecoins, allocating to cryptocurrencies like BTC/ETH for diversification, and using funds for user incentives.\n- **Prohibitions**: To prevent speculative activities, including banning the engagement in swapping assets for speculative tokens or protocols and prohibiting speculative bets on low market cap assets.\n\n## Policies & Procedures Update\n\n### Uncertainty in Scope\n- **Governance Engagement**: Submitting proposals to governance for specific actions beyond the mandate or amending the DFC’s authority as needed.\n\n### Agenda Procedure\n- Detailed rationales required for agenda items, focusing on revenue growth, user expansion, position management, and cost analysis.\n\n### Vote of No-Confidence Amendment\n- Allows any DFC member to trigger a vote of no-confidence in another member, with governance deciding on removal. Tokenomics workstream leader or any member of the DFC will put a proposal up within 7 days of appointment.\n\n### Emergency Authorization Powers\n- If below quorum, the DFC can vote in new members to reach quorum, subject to governance re-affirmation within 7 days.\n\n## Rationale\nThe proposed expansion and reformation of TMDC into DFC are driven by the evolving needs of the ShapeShift DAO. The inclusion of fee management and broader asset oversight will equip the committee to make more informed, strategic decisions that align with the DAO's long-term vision and sustainability. The committee's priority is to take a holistic approach to DAO treasury management, and must act toward the long-term success of FOX token holders, the FOX token ecosystem, and thus the ShapeShift DAO as a whole​​. By encompassing a more comprehensive financial strategy, DFC will play a crucial role in steering the DAO towards financial resilience and prosperity.\nThe recent Optimism (OP) grant situation underscores the necessity for the expanded mandate proposed for the TMDC. Without explicit inclusion in the TMDC's mandate, the management of such assets rests in a state of limbo, pending direct governance actions. This scenario reflects a critical oversight: the failure to anticipate the diversification of assets like the OP grant, which, while crucial for the DAO's strategy, fall outside the traditional FOX-focused paradigm. The absence of a clear, proactive management strategy for these assets could lead to missed opportunities or missteps, undermining the DAO's operational efficiency and strategic agility.\nInitially, the Treasury Management and Diversification Committee (TMDC) was envisioned with a focused scope, primarily managing the 180M FOX tokens and assets derived therefrom. This scope was rooted in the belief that direct DAO governance should preside over assets outside this purview. However, the landscape of governance and asset management within the DAO has evolved significantly since the TMDC's inception, revealing gaps in this approach. Meanwhile, the ecosystem of protocol DAO risk management has blossomed into a category. There are numerous examples of teams allocating assets, performing open market operations, changing parameters based on monthly analysis, and reporting it all back to token holders for rigorous review.\nThe rationale for expanding the TMDC into the DFC and broadening its mandate is precisely to address such scenarios. By entrusting the DFC with the management of the grants and future non-FOX tokens, the DAO ensures a more responsive and responsible stewardship of its assets. This proactive approach empowers the DFC to dynamically manage and leverage a diverse portfolio of assets, aligning with the DAO's evolving needs and governance discourse, and ultimately fortifying the DAO's financial foundation and strategic execution.\n\n\n## Benefits\n- **Comprehensive Financial Oversight** The DFC will have a broader mandate, enabling it to manage discounts, fees, grants, and non-FOX token revenues more effectively. This holistic approach ensures that all aspects of the DAO's treasury and financial health are under vigilant oversight.\n\n- **Strategic Financial Management** With the expanded purview, the DFC can make more informed decisions that align with the DAO's long-term vision and sustainability goals. This strategic approach allows for proactive management of the DAO's assets, enhancing financial resilience.\n\n- **Enhanced Governance Alignment** The reformation into DFC reflects a governance structure that is more aligned with the evolving needs of the DAO and its community. It allows for a more agile response to changes in the financial landscape and governance requirements.\n\n- **Operational Efficiency** By centralizing financial oversight and management tasks within the DFC, the DAO can achieve greater operational efficiency. This streamlined approach reduces redundancy and ensures that financial strategies are implemented cohesively.\n\n\n## Drawbacks\n- **Complexity in Oversight** The broadened scope of the DFC might introduce complexity in managing a wider array of financial tasks and responsibilities. This could require additional resources or expertise to navigate effectively.\n\n- **Potential for Overcentralization** With the DFC taking on an expanded role, there's a risk of overcentralizing decision-making power within a single committee. This could potentially limit diverse input and perspectives on financial management strategies.\n\n\n## Voting\n- **For**: Supports the transition and expanded mandate.\n- **Against**: Prefers maintaining the current TMDC structure.",

      "title": "After a Successful DAO Vote, ShapeShift decided to Launch the 1 Phase of the $gFOX Distribution",
      "content": "Background\nShapeShift's DAO governance is considering altering the ShapeShift Gold allocation rate, a newly approved function where 1% of bridge volume fees are converted to $gFOX. $gFOX has the potential to increase bridge transaction volume and reward holders, but will $FOX face market cap reduction if a derivative token supply is increased, or will the increase in bridge volume contribute to greater value for users. \n\n- Proposal\nIncrease $gFOX from 1% of bridge volume fees to 2% bridge volume to further incentive bridge usage and reward the ShapeShift community. Maintain $gFOX biannual rewards distribution timeline to encourage bridge prioritization and bolster market sentiment. Currently, for every $1M of bridge volume, $10,000 will be allocated to the $sGOLD treasury. This proposal suggests contributing $20,000 to $gFOX for every $1M of bridge volume, which will later be distributed to bridge users based on wallet activity. A majority vote of 51% or greater is required for the protocol to implement this new addition. \n\n- What is $gFOX and when is the first distribution?\nShapeShift's DAO has voted to implement $gFOX rewards for the first distribution, which is live for users from February 19, 2024 to March 15, 2024. Each $FOX holder is eligible if their wallet is older than 7 days, and they have made a txn with $FOX. $gFOX distribution rate will be based on wallet solvency levels and bridge volume. \n\nIf you haven't already, check [HERE](https://shapeshiftdex.org) if you are eligible for the Phase 1 $gFOX Rewards Distribution. \n\n- Execution\nIf this proposal receives a majority vote of 51% or greater, $gFOX treasury allocation rate will increase from 1% to 2% to further reward bridge users and hopefully increase overall bridge volume. \n\nIf the new reward's allocation rate is accepted, it will be implemented in the 2024 Q1 distribution. \n\nDon't forget to check if you are eligible for the Phase 1 $gFOX distribution if you have been an active $FOX user or staker. \n\n![5d127964111260e675c25267_Shareimage.png](ipfs://bafybeiggjmytrfmkc4i3f7fieqc6eag2vqgxd2hdl5egimbiw2ypdp44ay)",

      "title": "SCP-169 Tokenomics Workstream Renewal (02.01.24-07.31.24)",
      "content": "Tokenomics Workstream Renewal (02.01.24-07.31.24)\nSummary\n\nThis proposal seeks community approval for the renewal of the Tokenomics workstream and its lead for 6 months (retroactive to 02.01.24 and ending 07.31.24). This proposal includes the renewal of FOX compensation for the role of Tokenomics Workstream Leader, to ProfMcCarthy, with a compensation of $14,000 (entirely in FOX) per month of (3-month) locked FOX compensation. The Tokenomics Workstream Leader will oversee the management and revitalization of the ShapeShift DAO tokenomics and create dashboards and publish updates regarding the ShapeShift DAO to forums and Medium.\n\nAbstract\nOver the last three months, I have had the opportunity to gain a deeper understanding of the tokenomics needs of the DAO. In addition to basic reporting, FOX holdings on different chains, grant and fee revenue, LP decisions, it is clear to me now that analyzing and providing insights to the TMDC and workstream leaders is crucial for them to function.\n\nThe DAO has made significant progress in the last three months in terms of its sustainability. This is the result of both the implementation of fees and the TWAPs. Fee parameter management continues to be a core focus of this role, however, identification and analysis of relevant KPIs must precede any TMDC fee parameter changes. After years of resistance, the DAO finally embraced TWAPs, which has allowed for the repayment of our Arbor loans with no impact on runway.\n\nAlongside PTT and FBL, significant progress has been made on dashboard reporting. Some key features include identifying the number of transactions, average swap size, top pairs, and total fees received by the DAO. Dashboards are being developed in the following order of priority: fees and grant revenue accounting, treasury holdings, TMDC holdings, TMDC actions, liquidity analysis, and governance activity. In addition to these dashboards, I have been reporting twice weekly to the TMDC regarding our stablecoins, revenues, outstanding debt obligations, liquidity across chains, rebalancing efforts, and stablecoin generation activities.\n\nAside from highlighting some of the things that have been going well, I want to also acknowledge a few remaining opportunities. In the interest of transparency, I have listed the tasks I had previously proposed below and provided updates on where I stand with them. Having three months under my belt, I am clearer on the vision and goals. With revised timelines and tapping into the resources available to me, I am confident in my ability to complete these tasks in a way that provides the greatest value to the DAO and contributors.\n\nMotivation\nThe motivation behind this proposal is to formalize the continuation of the Tokenomics Workstream under the leadership of ProfMcCarthy. ProfMcCarthy is an Associate Professor of Economics at a state college in the US with a PhD in Economics from Colorado State University. They have experience in managing the DAO’s treasury, as they have been on the TMDC since its inception in October 2021. This transition is imperative to address the evolving dynamics of our ecosystem and align our tokenomics with the community’s interests.\n\nSpecification\nThe Tokenomics Workstream Leader, ProfMcCarthy, task progress update:\n\nAccomplishments\nPlease see the forum post for this table (omitted due to character limitations)\n\nAdditionally, the Tokenomics Workstream Leader will play a crucial role in assessing the impact of the expanded fee model on our tokenomics, fine-tuning the fee model parameters, gathering feedback, providing data-driven insights, ensuring integration with governance, and staying up-to-date with market trends and competitor fee models. Additionally, alongside TMDC, the workstream will focus on stewarding the FOX foundation loan and keep a keen eye on the DAO’s token revenues, stable revenues, and outstanding liabilities with rigor and transparency.\n\nProfMcCarthy holds office hours, presents at Tokenomics meetings, recruits new members to the DAO and the Tokenomics workstream and the TMDC, and makes themselves available async within hours should any community member have need of them, day or night, seven days a week. ProfMcCarthy monitors FOX price, liquidity, rewards programs, and the DAO’s LP positions.\n\nProfMcCarthy would keep his role on the TMDC but forgo compensation previously allocated to him for the TMDC role.\n\nProposed Goals and KPIs for the Tokenomics Workstream\n\nIn response to community feedback and to further align our efforts with the DAO’s strategic objectives, the following goals and KPIs are proposed for the Tokenomics Workstream under my leadership:\n\nMaintain a Minimum of Three Months of Stablecoin Runway in Treasury: To ensure the DAO’s operational resilience, we aim to maintain at least a three-month runway in stablecoin reserves within our treasury at all times. This will provide a buffer against market volatility and ensure continuity in DAO operations.\n\nProviding Data Support for the Fee Management by TMDC/DFC: A key focus will be on engaging with the TMDC/DFC and providing insights for their management and adjustment of fee structures to ensure that new volumes and features introduced to the DAO lead to increased revenue. This goal emphasizes the importance of providing information, analysis, and support to other parts of the DAO to better enhance their decision-making ability.\n\nRevenue Optimization Across All Streams: Collaborating closely with the TMDC and other relevant workstreams, we’ll seek to identify, analyze, and implement strategies to optimize the DAO’s revenue streams. This involves not just maintaining but enhancing existing revenue models and exploring new opportunities in alignment with the DAO’s financial goals and community values.\n\nTransparent Reporting and Goal Tracking: To foster trust and ensure accountability, regular updates will be provided on our progress towards these goals. This includes detailed insights into treasury management, fee adjustments, revenue optimization efforts, and any strategic decisions made by the workstream. These updates will be shared through forums, Medium posts, and during community meetings.\n\nMonthly Revenue Reports: The first report will be a monthly revenue report, published by the 7th of each month in the forum which provides a comprehensive account and analysis of the preceding month's revenues.\n\nBenefits:\n\nLeadership Continuity: Endorsing this proposal ensures uninterrupted leadership within the Tokenomics Workstream, enabling ProfMcCarthy to execute the evolved fee model, revenue forecasts, and meticulous management of the TMDC assets over the next 6 months. This continuity is crucial for maintaining the momentum gained in the previous term and for the seamless implementation of strategies devised for the DAO’s financial sustainability.\n\nExpert Oversight: ProfMcCarthy’s expertise in economics and previous contributions to the DAO provide a strong foundation for strategic decision-making and the ongoing revitalization of the DAO’s tokenomics. Their role is vital in navigating the complexities of tokenomics and ensuring that our strategies are data-driven and aligned with the latest market trends.\n\nEnhanced Community Engagement: ProfMcCarthy’s commitment to fostering community dialogue and incorporating feedback into tokenomics strategies enhances our alignment with community interests. This approach ensures that the DAO remains responsive to the needs of its members and adapts effectively to the evolving blockchain ecosystem.\n\nSupport for Dynamic Fee Structures: The renewal of ProfMcCarthy’s leadership will bolster the development and refinement of dynamic parametric fee structures. Their analytical skills and market insights are indispensable in optimizing these structures for maximum effectiveness and sustainability.\n\nDrawbacks:\n\nResource Allocation: Allocating FOX tokens for ProfMcCarthy’s compensation involves dedicating resources that could be utilized elsewhere. However, this investment is anticipated to yield substantial returns through proficient management and strategic enhancements to the DAO’s tokenomics.\n\nInherent Risks of Tokenomics: The field of tokenomics, being relatively nascent, carries inherent uncertainties. Despite rigorous analysis and risk mitigation strategies, there is always a possibility of unforeseen outcomes. However, ProfMcCarthy’s expertise and the adaptive approach of the Tokenomics Workstream aim to minimize these risks.\n\nVote:\n\nFor: A vote in favor signifies support for the continuation of the Tokenomics Workstream under ProfMcCarthy’s leadership, with compensation set at $14,000 per month in FOX tokens over a 6-month period. This renewal is vital for the ongoing management and strategic development of the DAO’s tokenomics, ensuring its long-term sustainability and alignment with community interests.\n\nAgainst: A vote against indicates opposition to the proposed renewal, leadership continuation, and compensation structure.\n\nPlease cast your vote as “For”, or “Against\" to express your stance on this proposal.\n\n[Vote Here: For / Against]",

      "content": "## **Mission:**\n\nCurate and propose a product roadmap based on research, user feedback/behavior, future market opportunities, and informed vision. Align with the mission and goals of the ShapeShift DAO and other workstreams for efficient execution.\n\n## **Goals:**\n\n- **Goal 1: Iterate & Execute on the Portfolio of Bets (POB) inside of the Themening strategy**\n- **Goal 2: Talk to Our Users & Deepen Ecosystem Partnerships**\n- **Goal 3: Refine Retention and Build Towards the North Star (150 MM per month by June — growth case)**\n- **Goal 4: Conduct Scoped Beneficial Experiments, Kill Under-performant ones, and remove bloat**\n\n### **Abstract -**\n\nAs a product-centric DAO, the Product Workstream is accountable for a number of activities: cross workstream alignment on execution, retaining/acquiring users, growing the FOX ecosystem, speccing/launching new product lines, and achieving Shapeshift’s mission.\n\nThere are monhtly cost reductions, and the budget is the same as the September budget. We have executed more users tests which is a plus and have plenty of FOX so will reduce that line item monthly.\n\nAdditionally all of the product workstream contributors have started taking double digit FOX to retain USDC runway, as per our last vote:\n\n> “Additionally, if things reach a more dire state on the DAO’s runway by January— through market conditions or through governance actions or through unknown factors— I will likely reduce my salary first to offset costs in the DAO. This is accountability folks, at least aspiring for some.”\n> \n\nOn product’s last approval, governance approved the portfolio of bets and adaptive roadmapping. Here is [the spreadsheet for tracking product inputs and roadmap execution](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NJAT22mVg2lwVPMneE4MYjGynl_JRgPY5WnCpec6Eh0/edit#gid=0). Though it wasn’t required, we did a goals performance breakdown at the end of the year as well: https://forum.shapeshift.com/t/product-goals-review-dec-1/2837.\n\nIt’s become obvious that ratifying the strategy, it’s bullet points, and the living documents therein every 6 months creates governance fatigue instead of alignment. It creates an unnecessary amount of work compared to the agility the DAO needs.\n\nAs a result, A YES vote for this renewal verifies the budget and team continuing, and also support for product’s execution strategy namely:\n\n- Supporting for the strategy for 2024 “the themening” https://forum.shapeshift.com/t/the-themening-a-pob-sequel/2888 applying a portfolio of bets every quarter\n- approval of the 1st half of the year’s goals https://forum.shapeshift.com/t/goals-1-half-2024/2875/2 and their metrics/KPIs.\n- An acknowledgement that all of this is flexible by design so we can capture market opportunities without putting granular items to vote or grand roadmap proposals.\n\n### **Specification -**\n\nWe track our goals at every [office hours](https://www.notion.so/Product-Goals-Tracker-81adc3222f844c62b9b7613f6ee9308f?pvs=21%3E) improving our documentation, rigor, and velocity. Since last vote the DAO has begun it’s path towards profitability and voted in the ability to monetize a larger surface area of the app. Onwards and upwards!\n\n**Responsibilities**\n\n- Prioritize and adjust the roadmap with cross workstream alignment.\n- Analyzing and surfacing new revenue streams that are not listed yet in the roadmap, but reporting back to the community with more details.\n- Coordinating research and resourcing in partnership with the FOX foundation.\n- Organizing and running the Monday afternoon roadmap and timeline meeting and coordinating with product and engineering throughout the week to remove blockers, assist with product related decisions and keep things moving through the feature development process and Product/Engineering status updates throughout the week.\n- Product representation at the Weekly Ops Sprint.\n- Conducting user tests and mentoring other product team members to manage them on their own.\n- Facilitate bi-weekly office hours to provide updates on progress, report on KPIs, and offer space to the community to ask questions, give feedback, and pitch ideas.\n- Draft product specs, reviewing designs, work with ENG workstream to evaluate engineering resources, and iterate the feature development process.\n- FBL will also spend a significant effort in defining core engagement loops & behaviors for users on Shapeshift, working backwards to activation moments to surface quick wins for development.\n    - Orthogonal to this is identifying user buckets or personas, working with MKBD and other workstreams and marketing to them\n- Hosting and Leading Spec kickoffs/spikes/breakdowns between Product and Engineering.\n- Spinning up regular retros (at either phase completion or large feature completeness)\n- Leading and continuing all scheduled team syncs and 1-on-1s.\n- Managing Budget and workstream contributor payments made through Colony.\n- Coordinating strategy sessions, touchpoint, and retros for launches. Facilitating where necessary.\n\n### **Budget and team**\n\nThe Product workstream will consist of 4 members. 3 full-time and 1 part-time.\n\n### **The total budget breakdown**\n\nAside from the 6% USDC savings, [The March - August 2024](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1reIsUV5GcYBF7tG1qvm9NlysDvCmI2lcsvXeRGuD-zw/edit?usp=sharing) breakdown will look familiar and almost a rubber stamp:\n\n**Monthly**:\n\n- $35650 (6% less)\n- $7,850 (USD in FOX — 24% increase)\n\n**$43,500 TOTAL**\n\nTerm Totals come out to:\n\n- $2400 USD in FOX value for user testing\n- $47,100 USD of FOX (including $2400 in FOX for user testing)\n- *$216,714 USDC\n\n**$263,819.40 TOTAL**\n\nThe change to the DAO topline budget is 1.5% less, thanks Figma for almost pushing us over the edge.\n\nThe additional addendums are the earmarked SaaS budget and the retained events budget:\n\n- SaaS\n    - current funds: [$629.76] —> continue holding funds in colony.\n    - Figma [$69 a mo for the team—nice]\n- Events\n    - ETH Denver ( I earmarked $200 a team member for flight or stipend [$600]. If they don’t go funds will go back to the DAO as per last budget.)\n\n### **Benefits -**\n\n- Ships the themening + POB, gets the roadmap going in iterative loops\n- executes quarterly with full transparency for Goverance.\n- Unlocks new features, continues alignment with a strategic lens, and continues execution of the product team’s goals.\n\n### **Drawbacks -**\n\n- We’re moving with more rigor so we aren’t shipping as many shiny features.\n- Our team is lean so there is only so many resources to cross allocate",

      "title": "SCP-167: Update SnapShot space and delegate authority to admins to update in the future",
      "content": "**Summary**\n\nThis proposal seeks approval from the community to make the following updates to the shapeshiftdao.eth SnapShot space:\n\n1. Ratify the recent increase of FOX voting power required to publish a proposal to 200,000 FOX\n2. Replace ShapeShift’s current SnapShot admins, who were appointed prior to the DAO launch, with the moderation workstream leader and treasury signers\n3. Officially delegate authority to the SnapShot admins to be able to modify certain settings in ShapeShift’s SnapShot space without requiring an additional proposal\n4. Create a new SnapShot sub-space for the Ideation stage of the governance process\n\n**Abstract**\n\nCurrently ShapeShift’s governance process depends heavily on SnapShot. Prior to the DAO’s launch, 4 foxes were appointed as SnapShot admins to get the ball rolling with the understanding that the community could make a proposal to replace or remove these admins in the future. Since then, a moderation workstream has been established, a process for electing treasury signers has been implemented, and several malicious proposals have been published with the intent of phishing FOX voters. In light of these developments, this proposal seeks to ratify the following changes to the shapeshiftdao.eth SnapShot:\n\n1. Ratify the recent increase of FOX voting power required to publish a proposal to ~~50,000~~ 200,000 FOX\n\n**Specification**: Required voting power to publish a proposal has already been increased to 200,000 to prevent the ongoing spam attacks. This simply ratifies this change.\n\n**Motivation**: Mitigate ongoing attacks and the risk of community members falling victim to scams.\n\n**Drawbacks**: This unfortunately has the unintended consequence of raising the barrier for community members to publish bonafide proposals. However, several community members have already offered to provide assistance and publish proposals on behalf of those that don’t have the necessary voting power. As mentioned, the community should consider additional or separate requirements to further defend against this exploit going forward.\n\n2. Replace ShapeShift’s current SnapShot admins with the moderation workstream leader and treasury signers\n\n**Specification**:\n\nBecause the owner of shapeshiftdao.eth is set as the controller of ShapeShift's SnapShot space, and because Gnosis Safes are not able to modify settings for SnapShot Spaces, a transaction is included in this proposal to transfer the shapeshiftdao.eth ENS name to one of the DAO Treasury signers. That signer will remove the current SnapShot admins and moderator, add the current treasury signers and moderation workstream leader as the new admins, and then transfer the ENS name back to the DAO Treasury. \n\nModeration worktream leader: Giantkin.eth (0xff75E131c711e4310C045317779d39B3B4f718C4)\n\nTreasury signer #1: 0xF5AA59151bE6515C4Ca68A0282CF68B3eA4846fC\n\nTreasury signer #2: 0x7a89f1838933DE0bA50aF0e916050977ceACAC9e\n\nTreasury signer #3: 0x8984476627010f0f50F1903f63BbdBe1176c5297\n\n**Motivation**: Align SnapShot admins with current treasury signers and moderation workstream leader, and avoid requiring a future proposal to update admins if these roles change hands.\n\n**Drawbacks**: This isn’t necessarily a drawback, but important to understand that each SnapShot admin’s account has the power to act beyond the community’s consent and in a worst case scenario, delete past proposals and prevent new proposals from being published and/or voted on by FOX holders. It’s important that admins are individuals that the community trusts to not abuse these powers as well as to secure their keys so they aren’t compromised.\n\n3. Officially delegate authority to the SnapShot admins to be able to modify certain settings in ShapeShift’s SnapShot space without requiring an additional proposal\n\n**Specification**: SnapShot admins will be granted authority to add strategies as long as the strategy grants 1 vote for 1 fox, no more no less, as well as authority to remove strategies that are no longer relevant, such as FOX deposited into Rari pools or the Tokemak FOX reactor, both of which have been sunset. Further, the ShapeShift treasury signers will be granted authority to execute the necessary transactions to add or remove SnapShot admins as long as each admin is either a treasury signer or the moderation workstream leader.\n\n**Motivation**: This will free up space for new strategies as ShapeShift’s space is already at the max capacity of 8.\n\n**Drawbacks**: those who still have FOX deposited into a Rari pool, Tokemak reactor, or a future chain or defi protocol that gets sunset will lose their corresponding voting power.\n\n4. Create a new SnapShot sub-space for the Ideation stage of the governance process\n\n**Specification**: If this proposal passes, a new space would be created called ShapeShift Ideation where Ideation proposals could be published. The ShapeShift Ideation space would be added as a sub-space to the main shapeshiftdao.eth space and would have all of the same settings as the main space, and the governance process would be updated to require that Ideation proposals are published and voted on in the Ideation space.\n\n**Motivation**: Have a dedicated space to review and vote on Ideation proposals, minimize redundancy in the main SnapShot space (which can lead to confusion or voter apathy for less active community members), and keep the main SnapShot space focused on proposals that have passed Ideation and have a greater likelihood of being refined and passing.\n\n**Drawbacks**: Changes in the governance process can cause confusion for those accustomed to the current process. This will also make Ideation proposals less visible. It also adds an additional space for the SnapShot admins to manage.\n\n**Voting**\nFor: Approve all changes\nAgainst: Reject all changes",

      "title": "SCP-166 a FOX tokenomics upgrade proposal",
      "content": "Summary\n\nThe goal of this proposal is to enact an upgrade to FOX tokenomics that more closely aligns the DAO with the THORChain ecosystem of which it is a vibrant part.\n\nAs part of its operations the DAO treasury receives and holds RUNE. This proposal would upgrade FOX tokenomics by paying a portion of the RUNE the DAO receives on a regular basis as “real yield” to FOX stakers in RUNE, as well as using a portion of that RUNE to buy and burn FOX.\n\nAbstract\n\nThe ShapeShift DAO has been building through the bear market, consistently improving the interface/product offering as well as adding a number of THORChain related features in particular (such as streaming swaps, Metamask Snaps, and soon lending). Most of the focus during that time has been on improving the product and attempting to acquire users (as it should be), however the tokenomics of the DAO have not gotten nearly as much attention. This started to change slightly with SCP-153 when the community approved using FOX as a way to get discounted fees when trading. This proposal suggests, on the back of SCP-153, that the DAO should further embrace its alignment with the THORChain community by upgrading FOX tokenomics to enshrine that alignment with RUNE and the THORChain ecosystem at large.\n\nMotivation\n\nShapeShift was and is one of the earliest THORChain supporters, well before others in the ecosystem recognized its value and even before the DAO launched, ShapeShift integrated THORChain for crosschain swaps. ShapeShift has consistently supported THORChain features as they are made available and most of ShapeShift DAO’s trading volume comes from users utilizing THORChain. The main motivation here is to encourage the ShapeShift community to further embrace and strategically focus on the THORChain ecosystem as its best opportunity. One of the best ways to do that is through an upgrade to FOX tokenomics that further aligns the ShapeShift DAO and THORChain communities together.\n\nSpecification\n\nIf passed, this proposal would dictate the following:\n\n1. X% of all new RUNE accumulated by the DAO treasury (from whatever source, whether donation, fees, or any other revenue stream) is paid out to FOX stakers as real yield every week (pro-rata across those who are staking). The definition of ”New” here means any revenue source that adds additional RUNE to the DAO’s treasury that wasn’t previously in the treasury prior to this proposal passing.\n2. X% of all new RUNE accumulated by the DAO treasury (again from whatever source, whether donation, fees, or any other revenue stream) is used to buy FOX from the open market which is then burned by being sent to 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000\n3. The remaining X% of RUNE would continue to be held and used by the DAO treasury as governance sees fit.\n4. In order to effectuate this new change, it will become required that in order to get FOX staking benefits (such RUNE yield and whatever else the DAO deems a “staking benefit” in the future), a user must stake their FOX in a staking contract (this staking contract will be chosen and implemented by Product and Engineering workstreams) as well as sign a message or transaction to assign the RUNE address where their yield will be paid. It should become standard that “unstaking” FOX takes a minimum of 28 days henceforth (though the receipt asset could still be liquid and transferable). To be clear this proposal passing would setup a simple single sided FOX staking mechanism for this purpose, it does not allow the DAO to use the staked FOX for other purposes, though future governance proposals may alter or evolve this to do so.\n5. New software will need to be prioritized and built by the Product and Engineering workstreams in order to allow a user to sign a message or transaction and assign a RUNE address where their yield will be paid. The user will also need the ability to update/edit this address at future dates by signing a new transaction.\n6. The DAO multisig will effectuate these RUNE and FOX transactions on a weekly basis based on the RUNE revenue numbers from the prior week.\n7. If this proposal passes, indicating the community has passed the overall tokenomics upgrade model, it will trigger an additional and immediate 7 day long snapshot vote where the community can vote on 1 of 3 options for the starting parameters (which will set the X%’s above). Those three options will be (a) 25% of RUNE to staking yield, 25% used for buyback and burn, 50% held by the treasury, (b) 25% of RUNE to staking yield, 25% used for buyback and then treasury locked, 50% held by the treasury, and (c ) 10% of RUNE to staking yield, 10% for buyback and burn, 80% held by the treasury.\nIf this starts to see increasing success and scale (in terms of overall RUNE volume, users staking, and number of transactions needing to be made by the multi-sig on a weekly basis) then it will make sense for engineering to create a bot for use by the multi-sig to make these transactions automated and more efficient (e.g. a hot wallet which the mutli-sig fills up every week that does the transactions automatically). This is not necessary to get it going, but would become a necessary upgrade once any sort of scale increase is needed. Ultimately this proposal leaves this implementation detail and timing up to the discretion of the product and engineering workstreams unless superceded by a subsequent governance proposal.\n\nEffectively the specification of this governance proposal would setup 3 parameters that governance could affect going forward: (1) % of RUNE accumulated that powers FOX staking yield, (2) % of RUNE accumulated used to buyback FOX from the market which is then burned (or treasury locked if (b) is the winning option) and, (3) % of RUNE accumulated that is held by the treasury. While this proposal passing would set the initial starting parameters for all three of these (via the contingent subsequent snapshot vote), governance can modify this with a subsequent proposal in the future to alter any of these, including setting any of them between 0-100%.\n\nBenefits\n\nThe major benefit to this proposal is upgrading FOX tokenomics in a sustainable way that more closely aligns the ShapeShift DAO with the THORChain ecosystem. With this alignment, the better RUNE and THORChain does, the better the ShapeShift DAO does as well. This creates ongoing yield opportunity for FOX stakers to earn RUNE (something which does not exist in many fashions outside of running a RUNE node or LPing on THORChain) and it starts to consistently burn FOX on a regular basis, all in a sustainable manner.\n\nAnother potential benefit to this proposal is that it could establish the foundation for a further upgrade to veTokenomics in regards to governance and for voting on how and where revenue the DAO earns is used on a more active basis. That is better served for a future proposal due to further complexity, but this proposal passing would setup such a natural evolution for subsequent tokenomic upgrades being successful.\n\nDrawbacks\n\nThe major drawbacks of this proposal are the time and priority of the product and engineering workstreams in order to make these changes and operate the system on an ongoing basis.\n\nIt also could create some additional ongoing burden and workload for the Operations workstream who would have to field and respond to user questions and issues around this tokenomics upgrade and its effects.\n\nThere are opportunity costs to aligning with the THORChain ecosystem further, such as not aligning further with other ecosystems the DAO may wish to pursue or other engineering and product features which do not get prioritized as a result.\n\nFinally the obvious drawback of aligning the DAO further with the THORChain ecosystem could have negative effects for FOX whenever RUNE is in a downtrend (such as in a bear market).\n\nVote\n\nVoting “For” this proposal would enact the tokenomics changes for FOX as stipulated in the specification of this proposal. The initial parameters will be set via a contingent secondary vote if this proposal passes as described in (7) of the specification section. A “for” vote also serves to prioritize the product and engineering work streams to enact this proposal as quickly as reasonably possible.\n\nVoting “Against” this proposal would enact no changes.",

      "title": "[Ideation SCP 170] Treasury Management and Diversification Committee (TMDC) Mandate Update & Rename into DAO Finance Committee (DFC)",
      "content": "Summary:\nThis proposal seeks to reform the existing Treasury Management and Diversification Committee (TMDC) by expanding its mandate and renaming it to DAO Finance Committee (DFC). This proposal also updates the procedures & policies of the DFC.\n\nThe new mandate includes explicit management of discounts/fees/promotion details from previous and future governance proposals, management of all grants & non-FOX token revenue to any of the DAO's wallets on any chain, and increases the oversight of token allocation from 180M FOX to encompass all grants & non-FOX token revenue. \n\nAbstract:\nAs discussed in [SCP-148] and [SCP-77], the TMDC has been pivotal in \"advising on the allocation over certain limited assets within the ShapeShift treasury\" and \"managing the treasury to meet payroll and operating expenses with stable coins each month\"​​. Building upon this solid foundation, the proposed DFC aims to integrate a more holistic approach by including fee management and all grants & non-FOX token revenue, ensuring a comprehensive treasury, revenue, and financial health approach. \n\nProposal Details:\n\nMandate Expansion and Renaming: The TMDC will be rebranded as the DAO Finance Committee (DFC), with an extended mandate to oversee a broader array of financial responsibilities. This includes:\nManagement of discount fee parameters from governance proposals.\nOversight of all grants and non-FOX token revenues across all DAO wallets and chains.\nEnhanced reporting on DAO's financial health and strategic recommendations for financial sustainability.\n\nPolicies & Procedures Update:\nAgenda Procedure: Agenda items for DFC meetings must be submitted with detailed rationales focusing on revenue growth, user expansion, position management, and cost analysis. This structured approach ensures thorough preparation and strategic alignment with the DAO's objectives.\nPolicy Adjustments: Introducing policies for proposing votes of no confidence within the DFC to maintain accountability and integrity among members. Removal of a DFC member requires unanimous consent from all other members, ensuring fairness and collective agreement.\n\nRationale:\nThe proposed expansion and reformation of TMDC into DFC are driven by the evolving needs of the ShapeShift DAO. The inclusion of fee management and broader asset oversight will equip the committee to make more informed, strategic decisions that align with the DAO's long-term vision and sustainability. The committee's priority is to take a holistic approach to DAO treasury management, and must act toward the long-term success of FOX token holders, the FOX token ecosystem, and thus the ShapeShift DAO as a whole​​. By encompassing a more comprehensive financial strategy, DFC will play a crucial role in steering the DAO towards financial resilience and prosperity.\n\nThe recent Optimism (OP) grant situation underscores the necessity for the expanded mandate proposed for the TMDC. Without explicit inclusion in the TMDC's mandate, the management of such assets rests in a state of limbo, pending direct governance actions. This scenario reflects a critical oversight: the failure to anticipate the diversification of assets like the OP grant, which, while crucial for the DAO's strategy, fall outside the traditional FOX-focused paradigm. The absence of a clear, proactive management strategy for these assets could lead to missed opportunities or missteps, undermining the DAO's operational efficiency and strategic agility.\n\nInitially, the Treasury Management and Diversification Committee (TMDC) was envisioned with a focused scope, primarily managing the 180M FOX tokens and assets derived therefrom. This scope was rooted in the belief that direct DAO governance should preside over assets outside this purview. However, the landscape of governance and asset management within the DAO has evolved significantly since the TMDC's inception, revealing gaps in this approach. Meanwhile, the ecosystem of protocol DAO risk management has blossomed into a category. There are numerous examples of teams allocating assets, performing open market operations, changing parameters based on monthly analysis, and reporting it all back to token holders for rigorous review.\n\nThe rationale for expanding the TMDC into the DFC and broadening its mandate is precisely to address such scenarios. By entrusting the DFC with the management of the grants and future non-FOX tokens, the DAO ensures a more responsive and responsible stewardship of its assets. This proactive approach empowers the DFC to dynamically manage and leverage a diverse portfolio of assets, aligning with the DAO's evolving needs and governance discourse, and ultimately fortifying the DAO's financial foundation and strategic execution.\n\nBenefits:\nComprehensive Financial Oversight: The DFC will have a broader mandate, enabling it to manage discounts, fees, grants, and non-FOX token revenues more effectively. This holistic approach ensures that all aspects of the DAO's treasury and financial health are under vigilant oversight.\n\nStrategic Financial Management: With the expanded purview, the DFC can make more informed decisions that align with the DAO's long-term vision and sustainability goals. This strategic approach allows for proactive management of the DAO's assets, enhancing financial resilience.\n\nEnhanced Governance Alignment: The reformation into DFC reflects a governance structure that is more aligned with the evolving needs of the DAO and its community. It allows for a more agile response to changes in the financial landscape and governance requirements.\n\nOperational Efficiency: By centralizing financial oversight and management tasks within the DFC, the DAO can achieve greater operational efficiency. This streamlined approach reduces redundancy and ensures that financial strategies are implemented cohesively.\n\nDrawbacks:\nComplexity in Oversight: The broadened scope of the DFC might introduce complexity in managing a wider array of financial tasks and responsibilities. This could require additional resources or expertise to navigate effectively.\nPotential for Overcentralization: With the DFC taking on an expanded role, there's a risk of overcentralizing decision-making power within a single committee. This could potentially limit diverse input and perspectives on financial management strategies.\n\nVoting:\nFor: Voting in favor of this proposal indicates support for the transition of TMDC to DFC, endorsing the expanded mandate and the strategic approach towards comprehensive financial management. It reflects a belief in the benefits of a more holistic and integrated financial oversight mechanism within the DAO.\n\nAgainst: Voting against this proposal signifies opposition to the changes, preferring to maintain the current structure and scope of the TMDC. This stance might be rooted in concerns over the potential drawbacks, such as increased complexity or overcentralization.\n\nFor with Changes: Voting \"For with Changes\" expresses conditional support for the proposal, suggesting that certain amendments or clarifications are necessary before full endorsement can be given. This option is for those who agree with the proposal's direction but seek modifications to address specific concerns or enhance its implementation.",

      "title": "[Ideation] SCP-168 Product Workstream renewal March 2024- August 2024",
      "content": "## **Mission:**\n\nCurate and propose a product roadmap based on research, user feedback/behavior, future market opportunities, and informed vision. Align with the mission and goals of the ShapeShift DAO and other workstreams for efficient execution. \n\n## **Goals:**\n\n- **Goal 1: Iterate & Execute on the Portfolio of Bets (POB) inside of the Themening strategy**\n- **Goal 2: Talk to Our Users & Deepen Ecosystem Partnerships**\n- **Goal 3: Refine Retention and Build Towards the North Star (150 MM per month by June — growth case)**\n- **Goal 4: Conduct Scoped Beneficial Experiments, Kill Under-performant ones, and remove bloat**\n\n### **Abstract -**\n\nAs a product-centric DAO, the Product Workstream is accountable for a number of activities: cross workstream alignment on execution, retaining/acquiring users, growing the FOX ecosystem, speccing/launching new product lines, and achieving Shapeshift’s mission. \n\nThere are monhtly cost reductions, and the budget is the same as the September budget. We have executed more users tests which is a plus and have plenty of FOX so will reduce that line item monthly.\n\nAdditionally all of the product workstream contributors have started taking double digit FOX to retain USDC runway, as per our last vote: \n\n> “Additionally, if things reach a more dire state on the DAO’s runway by January— through market conditions or through governance actions or through unknown factors— I will likely reduce my salary first to offset costs in the DAO. This is accountability folks, at least aspiring for some.”\n\nOn product’s last approval, governance approved the portfolio of bets and adaptive roadmapping. Here is [the spreadsheet for tracking product inputs and roadmap execution](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NJAT22mVg2lwVPMneE4MYjGynl_JRgPY5WnCpec6Eh0/edit#gid=0). Though it wasn’t required, we did a goals performance breakdown at the end of the year as well: https://forum.shapeshift.com/t/product-goals-review-dec-1/2837.\n\nIt’s become obvious that ratifying the strategy, it’s bullet points, and the living documents therein every 6 months creates governance fatigue instead of alignment. It creates an unnecessary amount of work compared to the agility the DAO needs.\n\nAs a result, A YES vote for this renewal verifies the budget and team continuing, and also support for product’s execution strategy namely: \n\n- Supporting for the strategy for 2024 “the themening”  https://forum.shapeshift.com/t/the-themening-a-pob-sequel/2888 applying a portfolio of bets every quarter\n- approval of the 1st half of the year’s goals https://forum.shapeshift.com/t/goals-1-half-2024/2875/2 and their metrics/KPIs.\n- An acknowledgement that all of this is flexible by design so we can capture market opportunities without putting granular items to vote or grand roadmap proposals.\n\n### **Specification -**\n\nWe track our goals at every [office hours](https://forum.shapeshift.com/edit_topic/%5B%3Chttps://www.notion.so/shapeshift/Product-Goals-Tracker-81adc3222f844c62b9b7613f6ee9308f?pvs=4%3E%5D(%3Chttps://www.notion.so/Product-Goals-Tracker-81adc3222f844c62b9b7613f6ee9308f?pvs=21%3E)) improving our documentation, rigor, and velocity. Since last vote the DAO has begun it’s path towards profitability and voted in the ability to monetize a larger surface area of the app. Onwards and upwards!\n\n**Responsibilities**\n\n- Prioritize and adjust the roadmap with cross workstream alignment.\n- Analyzing and surfacing new revenue streams that are not listed yet in the roadmap, but reporting back to the community with more details.\n- Coordinating research and resourcing in partnership with the FOX foundation.\n- Organizing and running the Monday afternoon roadmap and timeline meeting and coordinating with product and engineering throughout the week to remove blockers, assist with product related decisions and keep things moving through the feature development process and Product/Engineering status updates throughout the week.\n- Product representation at the Weekly Ops Sprint.\n- Conducting user tests and mentoring other product team members to manage them on their own.\n- Facilitate bi-weekly office hours to provide updates on progress, report on KPIs, and offer space to the community to ask questions, give feedback, and pitch ideas.\n- Draft product specs, reviewing designs, work with ENG workstream to evaluate engineering resources, and iterate the feature development process.\n- FBL will also spend a significant effort in defining core engagement loops & behaviors for users on Shapeshift, working backwards to activation moments to surface quick wins for development.\n    - Orthogonal to this is identifying user buckets or personas, working with MKBD and other workstreams and marketing to them\n- Hosting and Leading Spec kickoffs/spikes/breakdowns between Product and Engineering.\n- Spinning up regular retros (at either phase completion or large feature completeness)\n- Leading and continuing all scheduled team syncs and 1-on-1s.\n- Managing Budget and workstream contributor payments made through Colony.\n- Coordinating strategy sessions, touchpoint, and retros for launches. Facilitating where necessary.\n\n### **Budget and team**\n\nThe Product workstream will consist of 4 members. 3 full-time and 1 part-time.\n\n \n![team march 2024.png](ipfs://bafkreig5pqpnjl2ewjtdfyte4cwm4ykhj5swvsbmuv347wfxsmptdei3fy)\n    \n\n### **The total budget breakdown**\n\naside from the 6% USDC savings, [The March - August 2024](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1reIsUV5GcYBF7tG1qvm9NlysDvCmI2lcsvXeRGuD-zw/edit?usp=sharing)breakdown will look familiar and almost a rubber stamp:\n\n**Monthly**:\n\n- $35650 (6% less)\n- $7,850 (USD in FOX — 24%  increase)\n\n**$43,500 TOTAL**\n\nTerm Totals come out to:\n\n- $2400 USD in FOX value for user testing\n- $47,100 USD of FOX (including $2400 in FOX for user testing)\n- *$216,714 USDC*\n**$263,819.40** **TOTAL**\n\n![Screenshot 2024-02-08 at 11.17.39 AM.png](ipfs://bafkreifizfwb4ti4ef2btqyr3n6lxubijjqxsgc53lishgk3wo5lkoun7u)\n    \nThe change to the DAO topline budget is 1.5% less, thanks Figma for almost pushing us over the edge. \n\nThe additional addendums are the earmarked SaaS budget and the retained events budget:\n\n- SaaS\n    - current funds: [$629.76] —> continue holding funds in colony.\n    - Figma [$69 a mo for the team—nice]\n- Events\n    - ETH Denver ( I earmarked $200 a team member for flight or stipend [$600]. If they don’t go funds will go back to the DAO as per last budget.)\n\n### **Benefits -**\n\n- Ships the themening + POB, gets the roadmap going in iterative loops\n - executes quarterly with full transparency for Goverance. \n- Unlocks new features, continues alignment with a strategic lens, and continues execution of the product team’s goals.\n\n### **Drawbacks -**\n\n- We’re moving with more rigor so we aren’t shipping as many shiny features. \n- Our team is lean so there is only so many resources to cross allocate",

      "title": "[Ideation] Treasury Management and Diversification Committee (TMDC) Mandate Update & Rename into DAO Finance Committee (DFC)",
      "content": "Summary:\nThis proposal seeks to reform the existing Treasury Management and Diversification Committee (TMDC) by expanding its mandate and renaming it to DAO Finance Committee (DFC). This proposal also updates the procedures & policies of the DFC.\n\nThe new mandate includes explicit management of discounts/fees/promotion details from previous and future governance proposals, management of all grants & non-FOX token revenue to any of the DAO's wallets on any chain, and increases the oversight of token allocation from 180M FOX to encompass all grants & non-FOX token revenue. \n\nAbstract:\nAs discussed in [SCP-148] and [SCP-77], the TMDC has been pivotal in \"advising on the allocation over certain limited assets within the ShapeShift treasury\" and \"managing the treasury to meet payroll and operating expenses with stable coins each month\"​​. Building upon this solid foundation, the proposed DFC aims to integrate a more holistic approach by including fee management and all grants & non-FOX token revenue, ensuring a comprehensive treasury, revenue, and financial health approach. \n\nProposal Details:\n\nMandate Expansion and Renaming: The TMDC will be rebranded as the DAO Finance Committee (DFC), with an extended mandate to oversee a broader array of financial responsibilities. This includes:\nManagement of discount fee parameters from governance proposals.\nOversight of all grants and non-FOX token revenues across all DAO wallets and chains.\nEnhanced reporting on DAO's financial health and strategic recommendations for financial sustainability.\n\nPolicies & Procedures Update:\nAgenda Procedure: Agenda items for DFC meetings must be submitted with detailed rationales focusing on revenue growth, user expansion, position management, and cost analysis. This structured approach ensures thorough preparation and strategic alignment with the DAO's objectives.\nPolicy Adjustments: Introducing policies for proposing votes of no confidence within the DFC to maintain accountability and integrity among members. Removal of a DFC member requires unanimous consent from all other members, ensuring fairness and collective agreement.\n\nRationale:\nThe proposed expansion and reformation of TMDC into DFC are driven by the evolving needs of the ShapeShift DAO. The inclusion of fee management and broader asset oversight will equip the committee to make more informed, strategic decisions that align with the DAO's long-term vision and sustainability. The committee's priority is to take a holistic approach to DAO treasury management, and must act toward the long-term success of FOX token holders, the FOX token ecosystem, and thus the ShapeShift DAO as a whole​​. By encompassing a more comprehensive financial strategy, DFC will play a crucial role in steering the DAO towards financial resilience and prosperity.\n\nThe recent Optimism (OP) grant situation underscores the necessity for the expanded mandate proposed for the TMDC. Without explicit inclusion in the TMDC's mandate, the management of such assets rests in a state of limbo, pending direct governance actions. This scenario reflects a critical oversight: the failure to anticipate the diversification of assets like the OP grant, which, while crucial for the DAO's strategy, fall outside the traditional FOX-focused paradigm. The absence of a clear, proactive management strategy for these assets could lead to missed opportunities or missteps, undermining the DAO's operational efficiency and strategic agility.\n\nInitially, the Treasury Management and Diversification Committee (TMDC) was envisioned with a focused scope, primarily managing the 180M FOX tokens and assets derived therefrom. This scope was rooted in the belief that direct DAO governance should preside over assets outside this purview. However, the landscape of governance and asset management within the DAO has evolved significantly since the TMDC's inception, revealing gaps in this approach. Meanwhile, the ecosystem of protocol DAO risk management has blossomed into a category. There are numerous examples of teams allocating assets, performing open market operations, changing parameters based on monthly analysis, and reporting it all back to token holders for rigorous review.\n\nThe rationale for expanding the TMDC into the DFC and broadening its mandate is precisely to address such scenarios. By entrusting the DFC with the management of the grants and future non-FOX tokens, the DAO ensures a more responsive and responsible stewardship of its assets. This proactive approach empowers the DFC to dynamically manage and leverage a diverse portfolio of assets, aligning with the DAO's evolving needs and governance discourse, and ultimately fortifying the DAO's financial foundation and strategic execution.\n\nBenefits:\nComprehensive Financial Oversight: The DFC will have a broader mandate, enabling it to manage discounts, fees, grants, and non-FOX token revenues more effectively. This holistic approach ensures that all aspects of the DAO's treasury and financial health are under vigilant oversight.\n\nStrategic Financial Management: With the expanded purview, the DFC can make more informed decisions that align with the DAO's long-term vision and sustainability goals. This strategic approach allows for proactive management of the DAO's assets, enhancing financial resilience.\n\nEnhanced Governance Alignment: The reformation into DFC reflects a governance structure that is more aligned with the evolving needs of the DAO and its community. It allows for a more agile response to changes in the financial landscape and governance requirements.\n\nOperational Efficiency: By centralizing financial oversight and management tasks within the DFC, the DAO can achieve greater operational efficiency. This streamlined approach reduces redundancy and ensures that financial strategies are implemented cohesively.\n\nDrawbacks:\nComplexity in Oversight: The broadened scope of the DFC might introduce complexity in managing a wider array of financial tasks and responsibilities. This could require additional resources or expertise to navigate effectively.\nPotential for Overcentralization: With the DFC taking on an expanded role, there's a risk of overcentralizing decision-making power within a single committee. This could potentially limit diverse input and perspectives on financial management strategies.\n\nVoting:\nFor: Voting in favor of this proposal indicates support for the transition of TMDC to DFC, endorsing the expanded mandate and the strategic approach towards comprehensive financial management. It reflects a belief in the benefits of a more holistic and integrated financial oversight mechanism within the DAO.\n\nAgainst: Voting against this proposal signifies opposition to the changes, preferring to maintain the current structure and scope of the TMDC. This stance might be rooted in concerns over the potential drawbacks, such as increased complexity or overcentralization.\n\nFor with Changes: Voting \"For with Changes\" expresses conditional support for the proposal, suggesting that certain amendments or clarifications are necessary before full endorsement can be given. This option is for those who agree with the proposal's direction but seek modifications to address specific concerns or enhance its implementation.",

      "title": "[Ideation] Tokenomics Workstream Renewal (02.01.24-07.31.24)",
      "content": "Tokenomics Workstream Renewal (02.01.24-07.31.24)\nSummary\n\nThis proposal seeks community approval for the renewal of the Tokenomics workstream and its lead for 6 months (retroactive to 02.01.24 and ending 07.31.24). This proposal includes the renewal of FOX compensation for the role of Tokenomics Workstream Leader, to ProfMcCarthy, with a compensation of $14,000 (entirely in FOX) per month of (3-month) locked FOX compensation. The Tokenomics Workstream Leader will oversee the management and revitalization of the ShapeShift DAO tokenomics and create dashboards and publish updates regarding the ShapeShift DAO to forums and Medium.\n\nAbstract\nOver the last three months, I have had the opportunity to gain a deeper understanding of the tokenomics needs of the DAO. In addition to basic reporting, FOX holdings on different chains, grant and fee revenue, LP decisions, it is clear to me now that analyzing and providing insights to the TMDC and workstream leaders is crucial for them to function.\n\nThe DAO has made significant progress in the last three months in terms of its sustainability. This is the result of both the implementation of fees and the TWAPs. Fee parameter management continues to be a core focus of this role, however, identification and analysis of relevant KPIs must precede any TMDC fee parameter changes. After years of resistance, the DAO finally embraced TWAPs, which has allowed for the repayment of our Arbor loans with no impact on runway.\n\nAlongside PTT and FBL, significant progress has been made on dashboard reporting. Some key features include identifying the number of transactions, average swap size, top pairs, and total fees received by the DAO. Dashboards are being developed in the following order of priority: fees and grant revenue accounting, treasury holdings, TMDC holdings, TMDC actions, liquidity analysis, and governance activity. In addition to these dashboards, I have been reporting twice weekly to the TMDC regarding our stablecoins, revenues, outstanding debt obligations, liquidity across chains, rebalancing efforts, and stablecoin generation activities.\n\nAside from highlighting some of the things that have been going well, I want to also acknowledge a few remaining opportunities. In the interest of transparency, I have listed the tasks I had previously proposed below and provided updates on where I stand with them. Having three months under my belt, I am clearer on the vision and goals. With revised timelines and tapping into the resources available to me, I am confident in my ability to complete these tasks in a way that provides the greatest value to the DAO and contributors.\n\nMotivation\nThe motivation behind this proposal is to formalize the continuation of the Tokenomics Workstream under the leadership of ProfMcCarthy. ProfMcCarthy is an Associate Professor of Economics at a state college in the US with a PhD in Economics from Colorado State University. They have experience in managing the DAO’s treasury, as they have been on the TMDC since its inception in October 2021. This transition is imperative to address the evolving dynamics of our ecosystem and align our tokenomics with the community’s interests.\n\nSpecification\nThe Tokenomics Workstream Leader, ProfMcCarthy, task progress update:\n\nAccomplishments\t\t\nPlease see the forum post for this table (omitted due to character limitations)\n\nAdditionally, the Tokenomics Workstream Leader will play a crucial role in assessing the impact of the expanded fee model on our tokenomics, fine-tuning the fee model parameters, gathering feedback, providing data-driven insights, ensuring integration with governance, and staying up-to-date with market trends and competitor fee models. Additionally, alongside TMDC, the workstream will focus on stewarding the FOX foundation loan and keep a keen eye on the DAO’s token revenues, stable revenues, and outstanding liabilities with rigor and transparency.\n\nProfMcCarthy holds office hours, presents at Tokenomics meetings, recruits new members to the DAO and the Tokenomics workstream and the TMDC, and makes themselves available async within hours should any community member have need of them, day or night, seven days a week. ProfMcCarthy monitors FOX price, liquidity, rewards programs, and the DAO’s LP positions.\n\nProfMcCarthy would keep his role on the TMDC but forgo compensation previously allocated to him for the TMDC role.\n\nBenefits:\n\nLeadership Continuity: Endorsing this proposal ensures uninterrupted leadership within the Tokenomics Workstream, enabling ProfMcCarthy to execute the evolved fee model, revenue forecasts, and meticulous management of the TMDC assets over the next 6 months. This continuity is crucial for maintaining the momentum gained in the previous term and for the seamless implementation of strategies devised for the DAO’s financial sustainability.\n\nExpert Oversight: ProfMcCarthy’s expertise in economics and previous contributions to the DAO provide a strong foundation for strategic decision-making and the ongoing revitalization of the DAO’s tokenomics. Their role is vital in navigating the complexities of tokenomics and ensuring that our strategies are data-driven and aligned with the latest market trends.\n\nEnhanced Community Engagement: ProfMcCarthy’s commitment to fostering community dialogue and incorporating feedback into tokenomics strategies enhances our alignment with community interests. This approach ensures that the DAO remains responsive to the needs of its members and adapts effectively to the evolving blockchain ecosystem.\n\nSupport for Dynamic Fee Structures: The renewal of ProfMcCarthy’s leadership will bolster the development and refinement of dynamic parametric fee structures. Their analytical skills and market insights are indispensable in optimizing these structures for maximum effectiveness and sustainability.\n\nDrawbacks:\n\nResource Allocation: Allocating FOX tokens for ProfMcCarthy’s compensation involves dedicating resources that could be utilized elsewhere. However, this investment is anticipated to yield substantial returns through proficient management and strategic enhancements to the DAO’s tokenomics.\n\nInherent Risks of Tokenomics: The field of tokenomics, being relatively nascent, carries inherent uncertainties. Despite rigorous analysis and risk mitigation strategies, there is always a possibility of unforeseen outcomes. However, ProfMcCarthy’s expertise and the adaptive approach of the Tokenomics Workstream aim to minimize these risks.\n\nVote:\n\nFor: A vote in favor signifies support for the continuation of the Tokenomics Workstream under ProfMcCarthy’s leadership, with compensation set at $14,000 per month in FOX tokens over a 6-month period. This renewal is vital for the ongoing management and strategic development of the DAO’s tokenomics, ensuring its long-term sustainability and alignment with community interests.\n\nFor with changes: A vote for with changes indicates conditional/limited support, contingent on additions/edits/deletions (Please note what they are in the forum--Thanks!)\n\nAgainst: A vote against indicates opposition to the proposed renewal, leadership continuation, and compensation structure.\n\nPlease cast your vote as “For”, \"For with changes\",  or “Against\" to express your stance on this proposal.\n\n[Vote Here: For / Against / For with changes]",

      "title": "[Ideation SCP 169] Tokenomics Workstream Renewal (02.01.24-07.31.24)",
      "content": "Tokenomics Workstream Renewal (02.01.24-07.31.24)\nSummary\n\nThis proposal seeks community approval for the renewal of the Tokenomics workstream and its lead for 6 months (retroactive to 02.01.24 and ending 07.31.24). This proposal includes the renewal of FOX compensation for the role of Tokenomics Workstream Leader, to ProfMcCarthy, with a compensation of $14,000 (entirely in FOX) per month of (3-month) locked FOX compensation. The Tokenomics Workstream Leader will oversee the management and revitalization of the ShapeShift DAO tokenomics and create dashboards and publish updates regarding the ShapeShift DAO to forums and Medium.\n\nAbstract\nOver the last three months, I have had the opportunity to gain a deeper understanding of the tokenomics needs of the DAO. In addition to basic reporting, FOX holdings on different chains, grant and fee revenue, LP decisions, it is clear to me now that analyzing and providing insights to the TMDC and workstream leaders is crucial for them to function.\n\nThe DAO has made significant progress in the last three months in terms of its sustainability. This is the result of both the implementation of fees and the TWAPs. Fee parameter management continues to be a core focus of this role, however, identification and analysis of relevant KPIs must precede any TMDC fee parameter changes. After years of resistance, the DAO finally embraced TWAPs, which has allowed for the repayment of our Arbor loans with no impact on runway.\n\nAlongside PTT and FBL, significant progress has been made on dashboard reporting. Some key features include identifying the number of transactions, average swap size, top pairs, and total fees received by the DAO. Dashboards are being developed in the following order of priority: fees and grant revenue accounting, treasury holdings, TMDC holdings, TMDC actions, liquidity analysis, and governance activity. In addition to these dashboards, I have been reporting twice weekly to the TMDC regarding our stablecoins, revenues, outstanding debt obligations, liquidity across chains, rebalancing efforts, and stablecoin generation activities.\n\nAside from highlighting some of the things that have been going well, I want to also acknowledge a few remaining opportunities. In the interest of transparency, I have listed the tasks I had previously proposed below and provided updates on where I stand with them. Having three months under my belt, I am clearer on the vision and goals. With revised timelines and tapping into the resources available to me, I am confident in my ability to complete these tasks in a way that provides the greatest value to the DAO and contributors.\n\nMotivation\nThe motivation behind this proposal is to formalize the continuation of the Tokenomics Workstream under the leadership of ProfMcCarthy. ProfMcCarthy is an Associate Professor of Economics at a state college in the US with a PhD in Economics from Colorado State University. They have experience in managing the DAO’s treasury, as they have been on the TMDC since its inception in October 2021. This transition is imperative to address the evolving dynamics of our ecosystem and align our tokenomics with the community’s interests.\n\nSpecification\nThe Tokenomics Workstream Leader, ProfMcCarthy, task progress update:\n\nAccomplishments\t\t\nPlease see the forum post for this table (omitted due to character limitations)\n\nAdditionally, the Tokenomics Workstream Leader will play a crucial role in assessing the impact of the expanded fee model on our tokenomics, fine-tuning the fee model parameters, gathering feedback, providing data-driven insights, ensuring integration with governance, and staying up-to-date with market trends and competitor fee models. Additionally, alongside TMDC, the workstream will focus on stewarding the FOX foundation loan and keep a keen eye on the DAO’s token revenues, stable revenues, and outstanding liabilities with rigor and transparency.\n\nProfMcCarthy holds office hours, presents at Tokenomics meetings, recruits new members to the DAO and the Tokenomics workstream and the TMDC, and makes themselves available async within hours should any community member have need of them, day or night, seven days a week. ProfMcCarthy monitors FOX price, liquidity, rewards programs, and the DAO’s LP positions.\n\nProfMcCarthy would keep his role on the TMDC but forgo compensation previously allocated to him for the TMDC role.\n\nBenefits:\n\nLeadership Continuity: Endorsing this proposal ensures uninterrupted leadership within the Tokenomics Workstream, enabling ProfMcCarthy to execute the evolved fee model, revenue forecasts, and meticulous management of the TMDC assets over the next 6 months. This continuity is crucial for maintaining the momentum gained in the previous term and for the seamless implementation of strategies devised for the DAO’s financial sustainability.\n\nExpert Oversight: ProfMcCarthy’s expertise in economics and previous contributions to the DAO provide a strong foundation for strategic decision-making and the ongoing revitalization of the DAO’s tokenomics. Their role is vital in navigating the complexities of tokenomics and ensuring that our strategies are data-driven and aligned with the latest market trends.\n\nEnhanced Community Engagement: ProfMcCarthy’s commitment to fostering community dialogue and incorporating feedback into tokenomics strategies enhances our alignment with community interests. This approach ensures that the DAO remains responsive to the needs of its members and adapts effectively to the evolving blockchain ecosystem.\n\nSupport for Dynamic Fee Structures: The renewal of ProfMcCarthy’s leadership will bolster the development and refinement of dynamic parametric fee structures. Their analytical skills and market insights are indispensable in optimizing these structures for maximum effectiveness and sustainability.\n\nDrawbacks:\n\nResource Allocation: Allocating FOX tokens for ProfMcCarthy’s compensation involves dedicating resources that could be utilized elsewhere. However, this investment is anticipated to yield substantial returns through proficient management and strategic enhancements to the DAO’s tokenomics.\n\nInherent Risks of Tokenomics: The field of tokenomics, being relatively nascent, carries inherent uncertainties. Despite rigorous analysis and risk mitigation strategies, there is always a possibility of unforeseen outcomes. However, ProfMcCarthy’s expertise and the adaptive approach of the Tokenomics Workstream aim to minimize these risks.\n\nVote:\n\nFor: A vote in favor signifies support for the continuation of the Tokenomics Workstream under ProfMcCarthy’s leadership, with compensation set at $14,000 per month in FOX tokens over a 6-month period. This renewal is vital for the ongoing management and strategic development of the DAO’s tokenomics, ensuring its long-term sustainability and alignment with community interests.\n\nFor with changes: A vote for with changes indicates conditional/limited support, contingent on additions/edits/deletions (Please note what they are in the forum--Thanks!)\n\nAgainst: A vote against indicates opposition to the proposed renewal, leadership continuation, and compensation structure.\n\nPlease cast your vote as “For”, \"For with changes\",  or “Against\" to express your stance on this proposal.\n\n[Vote Here: For / Against / For with changes]",

      "title": "[Ideation] SCP-168 Product Workstream renewal March 2024- August 2024",
      "content": "## **Mission:**\n\nCurate and propose a product roadmap based on research, user feedback/behavior, future market opportunities, and informed vision. Align with the mission and goals of the ShapeShift DAO and other workstreams for efficient execution. \n\n## **Goals:**\n\n- **Goal 1: Iterate & Execute on the Portfolio of Bets (POB) inside of the Themening strategy**\n- **Goal 2: Talk to Our Users & Deepen Ecosystem Partnerships**\n- **Goal 3: Refine Retention and Build Towards the North Star (150 MM per month by June — growth case)**\n- **Goal 4: Conduct Scoped Beneficial Experiments, Kill Under-performant ones, and remove bloat**\n\n### **Abstract -**\n\nAs a product-centric DAO, the Product Workstream is accountable for a number of activities: cross workstream alignment on execution, retaining/acquiring users, growing the FOX ecosystem, speccing/launching new product lines, and achieving Shapeshift’s mission. \n\nThere are monhtly cost reductions, and the budget is the same as the September budget. We have executed more users tests which is a plus and have plenty of FOX so will reduce that line item monthly.\n\nAdditionally all of the product workstream contributors have started taking double digit FOX to retain USDC runway, as per our last vote: \n\n> “Additionally, if things reach a more dire state on the DAO’s runway by January— through market conditions or through governance actions or through unknown factors— I will likely reduce my salary first to offset costs in the DAO. This is accountability folks, at least aspiring for some.”\n\nOn product’s last approval, governance approved the portfolio of bets and adaptive roadmapping. Here is [the spreadsheet for tracking product inputs and roadmap execution](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NJAT22mVg2lwVPMneE4MYjGynl_JRgPY5WnCpec6Eh0/edit#gid=0). Though it wasn’t required, we did a goals performance breakdown at the end of the year as well: https://forum.shapeshift.com/t/product-goals-review-dec-1/2837.\n\nIt’s become obvious that ratifying the strategy, it’s bullet points, and the living documents therein every 6 months creates governance fatigue instead of alignment. It creates an unnecessary amount of work compared to the agility the DAO needs.\n\nAs a result, A YES vote for this renewal verifies the budget and team continuing, and also support for product’s execution strategy namely: \n\n- Supporting for the strategy for 2024 “the themening”  https://forum.shapeshift.com/t/the-themening-a-pob-sequel/2888 applying a portfolio of bets every quarter\n- approval of the 1st half of the year’s goals https://forum.shapeshift.com/t/goals-1-half-2024/2875/2 and their metrics/KPIs.\n- An acknowledgement that all of this is flexible by design so we can capture market opportunities without putting granular items to vote or grand roadmap proposals.\n\n### **Specification -**\n\nWe track our goals at every [office hours](https://forum.shapeshift.com/edit_topic/%5B%3Chttps://www.notion.so/shapeshift/Product-Goals-Tracker-81adc3222f844c62b9b7613f6ee9308f?pvs=4%3E%5D(%3Chttps://www.notion.so/Product-Goals-Tracker-81adc3222f844c62b9b7613f6ee9308f?pvs=21%3E)) improving our documentation, rigor, and velocity. Since last vote the DAO has begun it’s path towards profitability and voted in the ability to monetize a larger surface area of the app. Onwards and upwards!\n\n**Responsibilities**\n\n- Prioritize and adjust the roadmap with cross workstream alignment.\n- Analyzing and surfacing new revenue streams that are not listed yet in the roadmap, but reporting back to the community with more details.\n- Coordinating research and resourcing in partnership with the FOX foundation.\n- Organizing and running the Monday afternoon roadmap and timeline meeting and coordinating with product and engineering throughout the week to remove blockers, assist with product related decisions and keep things moving through the feature development process and Product/Engineering status updates throughout the week.\n- Product representation at the Weekly Ops Sprint.\n- Conducting user tests and mentoring other product team members to manage them on their own.\n- Facilitate bi-weekly office hours to provide updates on progress, report on KPIs, and offer space to the community to ask questions, give feedback, and pitch ideas.\n- Draft product specs, reviewing designs, work with ENG workstream to evaluate engineering resources, and iterate the feature development process.\n- FBL will also spend a significant effort in defining core engagement loops & behaviors for users on Shapeshift, working backwards to activation moments to surface quick wins for development.\n    - Orthogonal to this is identifying user buckets or personas, working with MKBD and other workstreams and marketing to them\n- Hosting and Leading Spec kickoffs/spikes/breakdowns between Product and Engineering.\n- Spinning up regular retros (at either phase completion or large feature completeness)\n- Leading and continuing all scheduled team syncs and 1-on-1s.\n- Managing Budget and workstream contributor payments made through Colony.\n- Coordinating strategy sessions, touchpoint, and retros for launches. Facilitating where necessary.\n\n### **Budget and team**\n\nThe Product workstream will consist of 4 members. 3 full-time and 1 part-time.\n\n \n![team march 2024.png](ipfs://bafkreig5pqpnjl2ewjtdfyte4cwm4ykhj5swvsbmuv347wfxsmptdei3fy)\n    \n\n### **The total budget breakdown**\n\naside from the 6% USDC savings, [The March - August 2024](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1reIsUV5GcYBF7tG1qvm9NlysDvCmI2lcsvXeRGuD-zw/edit?usp=sharing)breakdown will look familiar and almost a rubber stamp:\n\n**Monthly**:\n\n- $35650 (6% less)\n- $7,850 (USD in FOX — 24%  increase)\n\n**$43,500 TOTAL**\n\nTerm Totals come out to:\n\n- $2400 USD in FOX value for user testing\n- $47,100 USD of FOX (including $2400 in FOX for user testing)\n- *$216,714 USDC*\n**$263,819.40** **TOTAL**\n\n![Screenshot 2024-02-08 at 11.17.39 AM.png](ipfs://bafkreifizfwb4ti4ef2btqyr3n6lxubijjqxsgc53lishgk3wo5lkoun7u)\n    \nThe change to the DAO topline budget is 1.5% less, thanks Figma for almost pushing us over the edge. \n\nThe additional addendums are the earmarked SaaS budget and the retained events budget:\n\n- SaaS\n    - current funds: [$629.76] —> continue holding funds in colony.\n    - Figma [$69 a mo for the team—nice]\n- Events\n    - ETH Denver ( I earmarked $200 a team member for flight or stipend [$600].

      "content": "Link to ideation post in the forum: https://forum.shapeshift.com/t/ideation-scp-167-update-snapshot-space-and-delegate-authority-to-admins-to-update-in-the-future/2935\n\nLink to RFC post in the forum, which has more context on each change: https://forum.shapeshift.com/t/rfc-update-snapshot-space-and-delegate-authority-to-admins-to-update-in-the-future/2921\n\n**Summary**\n\nThis proposal seeks approval from the community to make the following updates to the [shapeshiftdao.eth SnapShot space](https://snapshot.org/#/shapeshiftdao.eth/):\n\n1. Ratify the recent increase of FOX voting power required to publish a proposal to ~~50,000~~ 200,000 FOX\n2. Replace ShapeShift’s current SnapShot admins, who were appointed prior to the DAO launch, with the moderation workstream leader and treasury signers\n3. Officially delegate authority to the SnapShot admins to be able to modify certain settings in ShapeShift’s SnapShot space without requiring an additional proposal\n4. Create a new SnapShot sub-space for the Ideation stage of the governance process\n5. Set the voting period to 5 days for the main SnapShot space and to 7 days for the Ideation space\n\n**Abstract**\n\nCurrently ShapeShift’s governance process depends heavily on SnapShot. Prior to the DAO’s launch, 4 foxes were appointed as SnapShot admins to get the ball rolling with the understanding that the community could make a proposal to replace or remove these admins in the future. Since then, a moderation workstream has been established, a process for electing treasury signers has been implemented, and several malicious proposals have been published with the intent of phishing FOX voters. In light of these developments, this proposal seeks to ratify the following changes to the shapeshiftdao.eth SnapShot:\n\n1. Ratify the recent increase of FOX voting power required to publish a proposal to ~~50,000~~ 200,000 FOX\n\n**Specification**: Required voting power to publish a proposal has already been increased to 200,000 to prevent the ongoing spam attacks. This simply ratifies this change.\n\n**Motivation**: Mitigate ongoing attacks and the risk of community members falling victim to scams.\n\n**Drawbacks**: This unfortunately has the unintended consequence of raising the barrier for community members to publish bonafide proposals. However, several community members have already offered to provide assistance and publish proposals on behalf of those that don’t have the necessary voting power. As mentioned, the community should consider additional or separate requirements to further defend against this exploit going forward.\n\n2. Replace ShapeShift’s current SnapShot admins with the moderation workstream leader and treasury signers\n\n**Specification**:\n\nA transaction will be created to remove the current SnapShot admins and moderator and add the current treasury signers and moderation workstream leader as the new admins.\n\nModeration worktream leader: Giantkin.eth (0xff75E131c711e4310C045317779d39B3B4f718C4)\n\nTreasury signer #1: 0xF5AA59151bE6515C4Ca68A0282CF68B3eA4846fC\n\nTreasury signer #2: 0x7a89f1838933DE0bA50aF0e916050977ceACAC9e\n\nTreasury signer #3: 0x8984476627010f0f50F1903f63BbdBe1176c5297\n\n**Motivation**: Align SnapShot admins with current treasury signers and moderation workstream leader, and avoid requiring a future proposal to update admins if these roles change hands.\n\n**Drawbacks**: This isn’t necessarily a drawback, but important to understand that each SnapShot admin’s account has the power to act beyond the community’s consent and in a worst case scenario, delete past proposals and prevent new proposals from being published and/or voted on by FOX holders. It’s important that admins are individuals that the community trusts to not abuse these powers as well as to secure their keys so they aren’t compromised.\n\n3. Officially delegate authority to the SnapShot admins to be able to modify certain settings in ShapeShift’s SnapShot space without requiring an additional proposal\n\n**Specification**: SnapShot admins will be granted authority to add strategies as long as the strategy grants 1 vote for 1 fox, no more no less, as well as authority to remove strategies that are no longer relevant, such as FOX deposited into Rari pools or the Tokemak FOX reactor, both of which have been sunset. Further, the ShapeShift treasury signers will be granted authority to execute the necessary transactions to add or remove SnapShot admins as long as each admin is either a treasury signer or the moderation workstream leader.\n\n**Motivation**: This will free up space for new strategies as ShapeShift’s space is already at the max capacity of 8.\n\n**Drawbacks**: those who still have FOX deposited into a Rari pool, Tokemak reactor, or a future chain or defi protocol that gets sunset will lose their corresponding voting power.\n\n4. Create a new SnapShot sub-space for the Ideation stage of the governance process\n\n**Specification**: If this proposal passes, a new space would be created called ShapeShift Ideation where Ideation proposals could be published. The ShapeShift Ideation space would be added as a sub-space to the main shapeshiftdao.eth space and would have all of the same settings as the main space, and the governance process would be updated to require that Ideation proposals are published and voted on in the Ideation space.\n\n**Motivation**: Have a dedicated space to review and vote on Ideation proposals, minimize redundancy in the main SnapShot space (which can lead to confusion or voter apathy for less active community members), and keep the main SnapShot space focused on proposals that have passed Ideation and have a greater likelihood of being refined and passing.\n\n**Drawbacks**: Changes in the governance process can cause confusion for those accustomed to the current process. This will also make Ideation proposals less visible. It also adds an additional space for the SnapShot admins to manage.\n\n5. Set the voting period to 5 days for the main SnapShot space and to 7 days for the Ideation space\n\n**Specification**: Both the main snapshot space and ideation sub-space would be configured to require 5 day and 7 day voting periods respectively. \n\n**Motivation**: Simplify the process of making a proposal and eliminate the potential for a valid ideation proposal to be active indefinitely. \n\n**Drawbacks**: This would remove the ability to create proposals with custom voting periods.\n\n**Voting**\nFor: Approve all changes\nAgainst: Reject all changes",

      "title": "SCP - 165 - Renewing the Operations Workstream Feb - July 2024",
      "content": "Summary\n\nApproving this proposal is would signal a continuation of budget funding for another 6 month term, February 1st - July 31st, 2024 (sixth consecutive term) for the current Operations Workstream that was established and renewed with passing of the previous proposals: [SCP-8], [SCP-59], [SCP-94], [SCP-125], and [SCP-147].\n\nThis proposal seeks to renew the Operations workstream with its current contributors, KPIs, and goals. The Operations workstream is always open and flexible to collaborative updates to future responsibilities, processes, and success metrics to continue to support the DAO as we continue to constantly evolve.\n\nThis proposal adopts [SCP-92] Definition of Workstream Leader\n\nAbstract\n\nThe Operations workstream is an integral part of the growth and development of healthy systems for reliably producing and maintaining the ShapeShift product suite and its uptime, responsiveness and feature functionality. The Operations Workstream provides front line assistance and monitoring of the products produced by the DAO in both customer support and feature testing throughout the release process. The workstream additionally provides similar support and structure to the DAO, its ecosystem, networks, and meeting structure.\n\nThrough Production Issue Procedure Best Practices, Triage Management, Deployment and Regression Testing, Customer Support and DAO Admin Procedures and Practices, the ShapeShift DAO Operations Workstream provides essential resources and tools for efficiency, organization, and overall product and services health that are vital to the success of the DAO, the product suite, it’s contributors, and $FOX token utility.\n\nMotivation\n\nRenewing this workstream will allow Operations to continue to work side by side with other workstreams to increase efficiency in individual procedural processes across the DAO and help progress deployment and testing processes while still verifying and maintaining reliability, health, and full functionality of all outlined responsibilities and services.\n\nAreas of focus and Operations responsibilities maintained by the workstream also include: Hosting the Weekly Governance call and advocating the Governance process, Organizing and hosting the quarterly AllFox community call, Marketing support and release communication, Leading and collaborating in Product specs, Weekly Release Thread updates in the forum, Expected Feature Release Testing guidelines, Go/No Gos, Retros and other coordinated meetings or DAO processes, RDP management, Gitbook documentation management (Undergoing a facelift this renewal),and full coverage of customer support.\n\nThe Operations workstream continues to focus on the wider picture of the product suite’s uptime, functionality, and overall health and user support. It additionally mirrors that responsibility in the DAO Discord, Github, and Notion by synergizing and coordinating cross-stream collaboration further strengthening the DAO.\n\nThis six month period will have an additional focus on building out resources and KPIs focused around error monitoring in mixpanel and functionality monitoring such as refunded trades in decentralized public resources.\n\nSpecification\n\nThe Operations workstream Notion repo can be found here.\n\nOperations maintains:\n\nTriage: Known Issues\n\n2023 Prod Issues tracking, Release Stats and testing fees,\n\nOps Sprint, Governance Call, AllFox, Go/NoGos, Retros, RDP program, Gitbook, Customer support (via Chatwoot).\n\nThe Operations Workstream strives to keep the greater DAO agile and committed to maximizing efficiency, scalability, and transparency with a strategic lean into data-based decision making. At times, best practices and procedures may be challenged, modified, updated, changed, archived or revisited to maintain those objectives. (See: The Bounty Process, Trusted Community Devs, Triage Report Tracker, Unsolved User Problems, the governance tracker, POAP minting, daily regression testing, the evolution of goat/no goats, etc)\n\nThe renewal term length for this workstream and its contributors is 6 months, from Februrary 1st 2024 to July 31st 2024.\n\nThis proposal continues @Tyler | ShapeShift as the Workstream leader and @MBMaria as Operations Coordinator.\n\nBudget ask: $132,000 $177,000 - 25.42% ($45k) less than the previous term\n\nMonthly USDC: $16,250 - 31.94% reduction from $23,875.00 last term.\n\nMonthly FOX: $5,749.80 - 2.22% increase from $5,625.00 last term.\n\nMonthly total budget: $22,000.00 - 25.42% reduction from $29,500.00 last term.\n\n6 month USDC budget: $97,501.20\n\n6 month FOX budget: $34,498.80\n\n6 month Total budget: $132,000.00\n\nFull budget details\n\nOperations would account for ~8.3% of the total DAO monthly stable spend if this proposal were to be passed:\nCurrent monthly USDC spend: 203,550 - Marketing renewal USDC savings: $2300 - Operations renewal USDC savings: $7625 = Operations New monthly USDC spend: $16250/New monthly USDC spend $193,625\n\nThe budget has been reduced in $USDC spend to continue to keep a conscious effort in reducing the footprint the Runway. This tighter budget removes one contributor role in the budget and maintains an agile and intimate team of Operations contributors that can collaborate across time zones to provide adequate coverage for support, triage, testing, and all other outlined needs of other workstreams, the DAO, and its product suite. This budget has a reduced team of 2 full time contributors as opposed to the staffing room for 3 approved in the previous term. All test and misc funds are now budgeted in FOX and reduced by 50% from the previous term’s budget.\n\nIf network conditions or the price of FOX decreasing dramatically alters or changes Operations ability to perform required deployment and regression testing, an additional proposal addendum for test funds may be proposed.\n\nOperations will continue to be mindful and agile about its processes with the DAO to continue to provide proficient coverage and support in all of the outlined areas of this proposal while maintaining our KPIs under this optimized budget.\n\nSpecific Goals and Success Metrics\n\nThe goals and success metrics for the Operations Workstream are listed below, split into current Goals and KPIs.\n\nCurrent Measurables:\n\nProduction Issue Best Practices\n\nGoals:\n\nTo minimize downtime of the entire product suite.\n\nTo resolve production environment bugs efficiently with minimal disruption to engineering processes, deployment cadences, or user experience.\n\nKPIs:\n\n99% uptime of the product suite and services:\n\nAugust: 98.9%\n\nSeptember 100%\n\nOctober: 100%\n\nNovember: 100%\n\nDecember: 100%\n\nJanuary: 100% (so far)\n\nAverage 6 month uptime: 99.81% (98.29% last term)\n\n<8 Production Issue Escalations per Quarter - 0 Escalations in Q3, 0 Escalations in Q4, 0 in Q1 so far.\n\n<50 Total Combined DAO Contributor hours dedicated to Production Issue Resolutions Per Quarter: 0 hours dedicated.\n\nTriage Management\n\nGoals:\n\nTo discover, isolate, navigate, and manage resolutions of user facing issues in all ShapeShift products and services.\n\nTo provide known troubleshooting and mitigation steps for issue reporters and users during the discovery and recreation of triage tickets.\n\nTo mitigate and expedite time required from core contributors spent on bug tickets, issue reports, and production level emergencies.\n\nTo transfer correctly completed and accurate Github tickets of triage bugs to Engineering or Product to be posted for bounty.\n\nKPIs:\n\nGreater than 80% resolution rate goal: 75.3 Resolution rate this term, 71% Resolution rate last term, 66% resolution rate previous term.\n\nThis goal was not hit this term again overall. Operations is improving our overall resolution rate term over term and aim to be able to exceed this KPI in this proposed term with improvements and optimizations to the Triage process and ticket review/clean up practices as a new focus this term\n\nDeployment and Regression Testing\n\nGoals:\n\nTo catch 95% of prod issues during the deployment testing process.\n\nTo catch user facing issues in production environments in regression tests and #triage them accordingly.\n\nA deployment test is completed by the Operations Workstream during each release process and upon request in pre-deployment branch testing.\n\nSpecific regression tests are performed once a week by an Operations Workstream contributor to complete a full monthly regression testing schedule in accordance with regression testing best practices.\n\nOperations prioritize blocking bugs, supporting engineers, and efficiency in the processes already in place over chasing non-blocking bugs for a ‘perfected’ release.\n\nIn the 129 releases deployed since August 1, 2023, 0 total prod issues were experienced. 0 Production issue bugs in 129 releases = 100%\n\nKPIs:\n\n<2 Cadences missed per quarter due to bugs overlooked in Ops Testing (0 cadence missed last term)\n\n<2 Rollbacks during releases per quarter due to bugs overlooked in Ops Testing (0 Rollbacks occurred last term)\n\nDAO Admin Procedures and Practices\n\nGoals:\n\nTo organize successful DAO meetings related to Goat/No Goat, Retros, Ops Sprints, and AllFoxes.\n\nTo track, organize, record, and optimize DAO repos keeping them current and relevant. To help in cross workstream collaboration projects that optimize efficiency and collaborative, transparent communication.\n\nTo provide assistance in projects that require support in generating procedures to be completed for the DAO or other workstreams.\n\nKPIs:\n\nKeep All Workstream leaders and key contributors informed and involved in contributions to all Ops Sprints, Governance Calls, AllFoxes Slide decks, Go/No Gos, and Retros.\n\nCharacter limit about to be reached, Benefits and Drawbacks are listed at the bottom of the RFC post:https://forum.shapeshift.com/t/rfc-scp-tbd-renewing-the-operations-workstream-feb-july-2024/2918",

      "title": "[Ideation] SCP-166 ThorFOX, a FOX tokenomics upgrade proposal",
      "content": "Summary\n\nThe goal of this proposal is to enact an upgrade to FOX tokenomics that more closely aligns the DAO with the THORChain ecosystem of which it is a vibrant part.\n\nAs part of its operations the DAO treasury receives and holds RUNE. This proposal would upgrade FOX tokenomics by paying a portion of the RUNE the DAO receives on a regular basis as “real yield” to FOX stakers in RUNE, as well as using a portion of that RUNE to buy and burn FOX.\n\nAbstract\n\nThe ShapeShift DAO has been building through the bear market, consistently improving the interface/product offering as well as adding a number of THORChain related features in particular (such as streaming swaps, Metamask Snaps, and soon lending). Most of the focus during that time has been on improving the product and attempting to acquire users (as it should be), however the tokenomics of the DAO have not gotten nearly as much attention. This started to change slightly with SCP-153 when the community approved using FOX as a way to get discounted fees when trading. This proposal suggests, on the back of SCP-153, that the DAO should further embrace its alignment with the THORChain community by upgrading FOX tokenomics to enshrine that alignment with RUNE and the THORChain ecosystem at large.\n\nMotivation\n\nShapeShift was and is one of the earliest THORChain supporters, well before others in the ecosystem recognized its value and even before the DAO launched, ShapeShift integrated THORChain for crosschain swaps. ShapeShift has consistently supported THORChain features as they are made available and most of ShapeShift DAO’s trading volume comes from users utilizing THORChain. The main motivation here is to encourage the ShapeShift community to further embrace and strategically focus on the THORChain ecosystem as its best opportunity. One of the best ways to do that is through an upgrade to FOX tokenomics that further aligns the ShapeShift DAO and THORChain communities together.\n\nSpecification\n\nIf passed, this proposal would dictate the following:\n     1. 25% of all new RUNE accumulated by the DAO treasury (from whatever source, whether donation, fees, or any other revenue stream) is paid out to FOX stakers as real yield every week (pro-rata across those who are staking). The definition of ”New” here means any revenue source that adds additional RUNE to the DAO’s treasury that wasn’t previously in the treasury prior to this proposal passing.\n    2.   25% of all new RUNE accumulated by the DAO treasury (again from whatever source, whether donation, fees, or any other revenue stream) is used to buy FOX from the open market which is then burned by being sent to 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000\n    3.  The remaining 50% of RUNE would continue to be held and used by the DAO treasury as governance sees fit.\n    4.  In order to effectuate this new change, it will become required that in order to get FOX benefits (such as discounts on fees, rewards, and any other benefits), a user must stake their FOX in a staking contract (this staking contract can either be the current FOXy contract or a new staking contract as determined by the Product and Engineering workstreams) as well as sign a message or transaction to assign the RUNE address where their yield will be paid. It should become standard that “unstaking” FOX takes a minimum of 28 days henceforth (though the receipt asset, such as FOXy or otherwise could still be liquid and transferable).\n    5.  New software will need to be prioritized and built by the Product and Engineering workstreams in order to allow a user to sign a message or transaction and assign a RUNE address where their yield will be paid. The user will also need the ability to update/edit this address at future dates by signing a new transaction.\n    6. The DAO multisig will effectuate these RUNE and FOX transactions on a weekly basis based on the RUNE revenue numbers from the prior week.\n\nIf this starts to see increasing success and scale (in terms of overall RUNE volume, users staking, and number of transactions needing to be made by the multi-sig on a weekly basis) then it will make sense for engineering to create a bot for use by the multi-sig to make these transactions automated and more efficient (e.g. a hot wallet which the mutli-sig fills up every week that does the transactions automatically). This is not necessary to get it going, but would become a necessary upgrade once any sort of scale increase is needed. Alternatively, if members of the community think that some version of a system to take care of these transactions should be built as a requirement of this proposal instead (perhaps with help from the FOX foundation or other external resources) then that section can be better scoped and added as a requirement to this proposal when it moves to the next governance phase.\n\nEffectively the specification of this governance proposal would setup 3 parameters that governance could affect going forward: (1) % of RUNE accumulated that powers FOX staking yield, (2) % of RUNE accumulated used to buyback FOX from the market which is then burned and, (3) % of RUNE accumulated that is held by the treasury. While this proposal passing would set the initial starting parameters for all three of these, governance can modify this with a subsequent proposal in the future to alter any of these, including setting any of them between 0-100%.\n\nBenefits\n\nThe major benefit to this proposal is upgrading FOX tokenomics in a sustainable way that more closely aligns the ShapeShift DAO with the THORChain ecosystem. With this alignment, the better RUNE and THORChain does, the better the ShapeShift DAO does as well. This creates ongoing yield opportunity for FOX stakers to earn RUNE (something which does not exist in many fashions outside of running a RUNE node or LPing on THORChain) and it starts to consistently burn FOX on a regular basis, all in a sustainable manner.\n\nAnother potential benefit to this proposal is that it could establish the foundation for a further upgrade to veTokenomics in regards to governance and for voting on how and where revenue the DAO earns is used on a more active basis. That is better served for a future proposal due to further complexity, but this proposal passing would setup such a natural evolution for the next tokenomic upgrade being successful.\n\nDrawbacks\n\nThe major drawbacks of this proposal are the time and priority of the product and engineering workstreams in order to make these changes and operate the system on an ongoing basis.\n\nIt also could create some additional ongoing burden and workload for the Operations workstream who would have to field and respond to user questions and issues around this tokenomics upgrade and its effects.\n\nThere are opportunity costs to aligning with the THORChain ecosystem further, such as not aligning further with other ecosystems the DAO may wish to pursue or other engineering and product features which do not get prioritized as a result.\n\nFinally the obvious drawback of aligning the DAO further with the THORChain ecosystem could have negative effects for FOX whenever RUNE is in a downtrend (such as in a bear market).\n\nVote\n\nVoting “For” this proposal would enact the tokenomics changes for FOX as stipulated in the specification of this proposal. The initial parameters would be set to 25% RUNE yield for FOX stakers, 25% RUNE used to buy back and burn FOX, and 50% of RUNE continuing to stack in the DAO treasury. A “for” vote also serves to prioritize the product and engineering work streams to enact this proposal as quickly as reasonably possible.\n\nVoting “For with changes” indicates that you want to see this proposal move to formal vote, but you want changes to the proposal for the final vote (that you have indicated in the forum or elsewhere what changes you want to see).\n\nVoting “Against” this proposal would enact no changes.\n\nThis now up for ideation snapshot voting here: Snapshot",

That is better served for a future proposal due to further complexity, but this proposal passing would setup such a natural evolution for the next tokenomic upgrade being successful.\n\nDrawbacks\n\nThe major drawbacks of this proposal are the time and priority of the product and engineering workstreams in order to make these changes and operate the system on an ongoing basis.\n\nIt also could create some additional ongoing burden and workload for the Operations workstream who would have to field and respond to user questions and issues around this tokenomics upgrade and its effects.\n\nThere are opportunity costs to aligning with the THORChain ecosystem further, such as not aligning further with other ecosystems the DAO may wish to pursue or other engineering and product features which do not get prioritized as a result.\n\nFinally the obvious drawback of aligning the DAO further with the THORChain ecosystem could have negative effects for FOX whenever RUNE is in a downtrend (such as in a bear market).\n\nVote\n\nVoting “For” this proposal would enact the tokenomics changes for FOX as stipulated in the specification of this proposal. The initial parameters would be set to 25% RUNE yield for FOX stakers, 25% RUNE used to buy back and burn FOX, and 50% of RUNE continuing to stack in the DAO treasury. A “for” vote also serves to prioritize the product and engineering work streams to enact this proposal as quickly as reasonably possible.\n\nVoting “For with changes” indicates that you want to see this proposal move to formal vote, but you want changes to the proposal for the final vote (that you have indicated in the forum or elsewhere what changes you want to see).\n\nVoting “Against” this proposal would enact no changes.",

      "title": "SCP-164: MKBD Workstream Renewal",
      "content": "# Summary\n\nThis proposal seeks to renew and expand the ShapeShift DAO's MKBD Workstream for the next six months, starting February 1, 2024. This proposal will:\n\n- Extend the existing team for the next 6-month term\n- Incorporate the FKA \"Globalization\" workstream into MKBD\n- Update workstream responsibilities and KPIs\n\nEssential tasks under the new MKBD team include product copywriting, co-marketing, partnership management, grants, external sales, and general marketing strategy and execution across a global landscape. This approach will save the DAO $93,525 over six months while utilizing existing top talent more efficiently for new market expansion.\n\n# Abstract/Summary\n\n- Integrate \"Globalization\" into the MKBD team.\n- Focus: Product copywriting, co-marketing, partnership management, grants, sales, and global strategy.\n- Enhanced KPIs reflect new responsibilities.\n\n# Financials:\n\n- Net savings: $93,525 over six months.\n- MKBD monthly spend increase: $2,563 (Total increase: $15,375 over six months).\n- Monthly DAO spending decrease: $15,588 per month.\n- Net total spend decrease: 40.50%.\n\n# Budget Allocation:\n\n- Fixed labor costs increase: 10.88%.\n- Discontinuation of \"Globalization Workstream\" (savings: $93,525 over six months).\n\n# Strategic Goals & KPIs:\n\n- Enhance brand and customer base through partnerships and user engagement.\n- Key targets: $150M trade volume monthly, 30% improvement in top-of-funnel engagement.\n\n# Key Deliverables:\n\n- Partnership management, user acquisition, content strategy, grants, and targeted international outreach.\n\nThis proposal adopts SCP-92 Definition of Workstream Leader.\n\n# Motivation\n\nThe Marketing workstream has shown what it can creatively accomplish with a minimal marketing budget for the past year. With the idea of continuing to operate in a lean, mean, and creative spirit, the MKBD team can provide the DAO with more targeted value and efficiency.\n\nMKBD achieved most of our goals while adding and successfully executing new responsibilities.\n\nTotal prior labor, marketing, and overhead spending was $154,500 over six months. This proposal increases the monthly MKBD spend by $2,563 (a $15,375 6-month increase) while decreasing total DAO spend by $15,588 per month (saving $93,525 over six months) by eliminating the need for the DAO to fund the Globalization workstream, as some of its existing high-performing members will be wrapped under MKBD.\n\nThis effectively saves $93,525 over the next six months一reducing runway burn by $15,588 per month while aligning DAO global and contributors under one leader, increasing the velocity, quality, scope, and accuracy of activations, messaging, and partnerships to align better with Product and Engineering.\n\nMKBD will continue to pursue limited grant opportunities as we saw success in narrowing the scope of grants to a limited set that directly supported the Product and Marketing Workstream roadmaps. Renewing this proposal will allow the existing team to lean into further refining goals and actions based on past learnings.\n\nThe DAO will still retain a reasonably globally translated and accessible application, and there will be no unreasonable downtime in keeping the DAO's products and messaging accessible to users around the globe.\n\n# Specification\n\n## Budget\n\nThe details below expand upon the budget spreadsheet:\nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QoQKcd_gBHiCk9Qrg-7FDlSXC92mfg5D72Rc_Ui5iYs/edit?usp=sharing\n\nTLDR:\n\n- Total Fixed labor + tooling costs: 10.88% increase ($15,375 over six months) from SCP-144\n- Eliminates the need to fund the FKA “Globalization Workstream” ($93,525 saved over six months) => net spending decrease of 40.50% between the two workstreams.\n- (see: Green line vs. Yellow Line in image below)\n \n![Q1 Budget.png](ipfs://bafkreibcr76mynczllcprnuj3hxibzyutaptf35a22aciloxkpg3l5yjda)\n    \n\n## Recurring Costs\n\n### Labor\n\nThe marketing workstream lead (Hpayne) fully adopts SCP-92 in this proposal. All newly added contributors to the workstream will be tasked with developing their own PIP (Personal Improvement Plan) to help onboard, hold accountable, and grow the team foundationally as the team merges.\n\nThese PIPs will accompany a weekly update that is candid, honest, and forward-looking with the spirit of seeking improvement, efficiency, and balance.\n\nShould the PIP be unsatisfactorily followed or executed, the contributor will be informed explicitly of the areas of improvement and given specific steps to improve. If the contributor is not performing satisfactorily, the workstream lead reserves the right to utilize SCP-92 and eliminate the position.\n\nAs it stands, the budget includes four full-time contributors:\n\n- Hpayne (Workstream Lead)\n- Atlan (Designer and Graphics)\n- TheSmith (International User Acquisition)\n- Vlad (Growth Engagement Lead)\n\nAdditionally, there are two part-time contributors:\n\n- Twells (Marketing Communications Lead)\n- Firebomb (International UX and Translations Lead)\n\n### Tooling\n\nTLDR: This budget seeks approval for the commitment of $12,000 USDC and $22,500 FOX for non-recurring costs to be spent judiciously at the workstream’s discretion, should it be required.\n\nThis budgetary item is provisional, and any unspent funds will be rolled over into the next proposal cycle to mitigate future budgetary asks.\n\nAny unused funds from any budget category will be kept in the workstream Colony and rolled over into the following proposal.\n\nA separate governance proposal shall be raised if the Marketing Workstream requires more funds.\n\n## Deliverables\n\n### KPIs\n\nCore KPI TLDR:\nThe MKBD Workstream will focus on KPIs that directly support the Product and Engineering roadmap and continue to build and proliferate the ShapeShift brand while driving meaningful revenue back to the DAO.\n\nStrategic Marketing Goals Proposal for ShapeShift\n\nObjective: To enhance brand presence, customer base, and overall performance through targeted marketing initiatives aligned with key performance indicators.\n\nI. Expand and Deepen Strategic Partnerships:\n\n- Goal: Deeply collaborate with nine key industry players (MetaMask, OnRamper, Ledger, CoWSwap, THORChain, Arbitrum, Gnosis chain, Optimism, LiFi) to boost brand exposure and optimize service usage inside app.shapeshift.com.\n- Stretch: Additional four partners to consider: Eigenlayer, Maya Protocol, xDeFi, Coinbase, Keplr, or additional as deemed appropriate.\n- KPI Measurement: Success of this goal would mean each partner has done three of the four objectives:\n  - Activated and coordinated with ShapeShift Marketing messaging\n  - Collaborated with the Product Workstream to give feedback on app feature implementation\n  - Has a POC the DAO can tap reliably (within one week) for answers and feedback on app\n  - Collaborated with BD team and passed to appropriate workstream (Tokenomics, engineering, etc) for further nurturing\n\nII. Boost Transacting User Acquisition:\n\n- Goal: Acquire new mid- to high-value customers who individually trade $3,500 - $5,000 per month on average within the next six months—northstar    goal of $150MM monthly volume through the swapper.\n    KPI Measurement: Daily Active Users (DAU) / Weekly Active Users (WAU) / Monthly Active Users (MAU).\n\nIII. Boost User Acquisition:\n\n- Goal: Acquire new customers who connect a wallet to app.shapeshift.com. Failure: 60,000 new connections, success: 80,000 new connections, growth: 100,000 new connections (per month).\n- KPI Measurement: Monthly sessions, monthly visitors.\n\nIV. Increase Customer Engagement:\n\n- Goal: Enhance customer engagement by working alongside the Product workstream to reduce churn and increase on-chain interactions in-app.\n- KPI Measurement: Correlation Analysis & Conversion Funnel Analysis.\n\nV. Optimize Content Impact:\n\n- Goal: Improve top-of-funnel engagement by 30% and inbound traffic by 50% in the next six months.\n- KPI Measurement: Growth Rate of Unique On-Chain Addresses & impressions per month via X, Medium, PUSH, Discord & Blaze\n\nVI. Engage new International Community:\n\n- Goal: Engage and activate with the Indian community to foster, activate, and convert potential customers into ShapeShift community members and dedicated power users.\n- KPI Measurement: Onchain interactions and conversions from mixpanel, UTM tracking, and depth of engagement on social channels.\n\nVII. Engage with grant ecosystems:\n\n- Goal: Engage with at least two top-identified crypto ecosystems or partners to research, develop, manage, and secure two grants totaling at least $50,000 of vested and unvested tokens.\n- Stretch: Engage with four crypto ecosystems partners to secure $100,000 in funding\n- KPI Measurement: Onchain interactions with DAO wallets.\n\n# Drawbacks\n\nMarketing labor and spending has the potential to be the most elusive to quantify and qualify within the DAO’s budget, which is why we outlined our goals, spending, and reporting metrics while keeping in mind brevity. Any aspect of these goals, metrics, and activations that do not seem appropriate to serve the needs and goals of the DAO or support the Product and Engineering Workstreams effort should be questioned.\n\n# Benefits\n\nThe MKBD effort markets, grows, and sells the ShapeShift product usage and awareness while retaining, strengthening, and enhancing the voice and brand image. Marketing and Business Development exist to scale and create opportunities for the ShapeShift product in dynamic markets.\n\n# Vote\n\n- **For** - Formalizes the community is “for” the details outlined in this proposal.\n- **Against** - Formalizes the community is “against” the proposal.",

      "title": "[Ideation] SCP - 165 - Renewing the Operations Workstream Feb - July 2024",
      "content": "Summary\n\nApproving this proposal is would signal a continuation of budget funding for another 6 month term, February 1st - July 31st, 2024 (sixth consecutive term) for the current Operations Workstream that was established and renewed with passing of the previous proposals: [SCP-8], [SCP-59], [SCP-94], [SCP-125], and [SCP-147].\n\nThis proposal seeks to renew the Operations workstream with its current contributors, KPIs, and goals. The Operations workstream is always open and flexible to collaborative updates to future responsibilities, processes, and success metrics to continue to support the DAO as we continue to constantly evolve. \n\nThis proposal adopts [SCP-92] Definition of Workstream Leader\n\nAbstract\n\nThe Operations workstream is an integral part of the growth and development of healthy systems for reliably producing and maintaining the ShapeShift product suite and its uptime, responsiveness and feature functionality. The Operations Workstream provides front line assistance and monitoring of the products produced by the DAO in both customer support and feature testing throughout the release process.  The workstream additionally provides similar support and structure to the DAO, its ecosystem, networks, and meeting structure. \n\nThrough Production Issue Procedure Best Practices, Triage Management, Deployment and Regression Testing, Customer Support and DAO Admin Procedures and Practices, the ShapeShift DAO Operations Workstream provides essential resources and tools for efficiency, organization, and overall product and services health that are vital to the success of the DAO, the product suite, it’s contributors, and $FOX token utility.\n\nMotivation\n\nRenewing this workstream will allow Operations to continue to work side by side with other workstreams to increase efficiency in individual procedural processes across the DAO and help progress deployment and testing processes while still verifying and maintaining reliability, health, and full functionality of all outlined responsibilities and services.\n\nAreas of focus and Operations responsibilities maintained by the workstream also include: Hosting the Weekly Governance call and advocating the Governance process, Organizing and hosting the quarterly AllFox community call, Marketing support and release communication, Leading and collaborating in Product specs, Weekly Release Thread updates in the forum, Expected Feature Release Testing guidelines, Go/No Gos, Retros and other coordinated meetings or DAO processes, RDP management, Gitbook documentation management (Undergoing a facelift this renewal),and full coverage of customer support.\n\nThe Operations workstream continues to focus on the wider picture of the product suite’s uptime, functionality, and overall health and user support. It additionally mirrors that responsibility in the DAO Discord, Github, and Notion by synergizing and coordinating cross-stream collaboration further strengthening the DAO.\n\nThis six month period will have an additional focus on building out resources and KPIs focused around error monitoring in mixpanel and functionality monitoring such as refunded trades in decentralized public resources. \n\nSpecification\n\nThe Operations workstream Notion repo can be found here.\n\nOperations maintains:\n\nTriage: Known Issues\n\n2023 Prod Issues tracking, Release Stats and testing fees,\n\nOps Sprint, Governance Call, AllFox, Go/NoGos, Retros, RDP program, Gitbook, Customer support (via Chatwoot).\n\nThe Operations Workstream strives to keep the greater DAO agile and committed to maximizing efficiency, scalability, and transparency with a strategic lean into data-based decision making. At times, best practices and procedures may be challenged, modified, updated, changed, archived or revisited to maintain those objectives. (See: The Bounty Process, Trusted Community Devs, Triage Report Tracker, Unsolved User Problems, the governance tracker, POAP minting, daily regression testing, the evolution of goat/no goats, etc)\n\nThe renewal term length for this workstream and its contributors is 6 months, from Februrary 1st 2024 to July 31st 2024.\n\nThis proposal continues @Tyler | ShapeShift as the Workstream leader and @MBMaria as Operations Coordinator.\n\nBudget ask: $132,000 $177,000 - 25.42% ($45k) less than the previous term\n\nMonthly USDC: $16,250 - 31.94% reduction from $23,875.00 last term.\n\nMonthly FOX: $5,749.80 - 2.22% increase from $5,625.00 last term.\n\nMonthly total budget: $22,000.00 - 25.42% reduction from $29,500.00 last term.\n\n6 month USDC budget: $97,501.20\n\n6 month FOX budget: $34,498.80\n\n6 month Total budget: $132,000.00\n\nFull budget details\n\nOperations would account for ~8.3% of the total DAO monthly stable spend if this proposal were to be passed:\nCurrent monthly USDC spend: 203,550 - Marketing renewal USDC savings: $2300 - Operations renewal USDC savings: $7625 = Operations New monthly USDC spend: $16250/New monthly USDC spend $193,625\n\nThe budget has been reduced in $USDC spend to continue to keep a conscious effort in reducing the footprint the Runway. This tighter budget removes one contributor role in the budget and maintains an agile and intimate team of Operations contributors that can collaborate across time zones to provide adequate coverage for support, triage, testing, and all other outlined needs of other workstreams, the DAO, and its product suite. This budget has a reduced team of 2 full time contributors as opposed to the staffing room for 3 approved in the previous term.  All test and misc funds are now budgeted in FOX and reduced by 50% from the previous term’s budget. \n\nIf network conditions or the price of FOX decreasing dramatically alters or changes Operations ability to perform required deployment and regression testing, an additional proposal addendum for test funds may be proposed.\n\nOperations will continue to be mindful and agile about its processes with the DAO to continue to provide proficient coverage and support in all of the outlined areas of this proposal while maintaining our KPIs under this optimized budget.\n\nSpecific Goals and Success Metrics\n\nThe goals and success metrics for the Operations Workstream are listed below, split into current Goals and KPIs.\n\nCurrent Measurables:\n\nProduction Issue Best Practices\n\nGoals:\n\nTo minimize downtime of the entire product suite.\n\nTo resolve production environment bugs efficiently with minimal disruption to engineering processes, deployment cadences, or user experience.\n\nKPIs:\n\n99% uptime of the product suite and services:\n\nAugust: 98.9%\n\nSeptember 100%\n\nOctober: 100%\n\nNovember: 100%\n\nDecember: 100%\n\nJanuary: 100% (so far)\n\nAverage 6 month uptime: 99.81% (98.29% last term)\n\n<8 Production Issue Escalations per Quarter - 0 Escalations in Q3, 0 Escalations in Q4, 0 in Q1 so far.\n\n<50 Total Combined DAO Contributor hours dedicated to Production Issue Resolutions Per Quarter: 0 hours dedicated.\n\nTriage Management\n\nGoals:\n\nTo discover, isolate, navigate, and manage resolutions of user facing issues in all ShapeShift products and services.\n\nTo provide known troubleshooting and mitigation steps for issue reporters and users during the discovery and recreation of triage tickets.\n\nTo mitigate and expedite time required from core contributors spent on bug tickets, issue reports, and production level emergencies.\n\nTo transfer correctly completed and accurate Github tickets of triage bugs to Engineering or Product to be posted for bounty.\n\nKPIs:\n\nGreater than 80% resolution rate goal: 75.3 Resolution rate this term, 71% Resolution rate last term, 66% resolution rate previous term.\n\nThis goal was not hit this term again overall. Operations is improving our overall resolution rate term over term and aim to be able to exceed this KPI in this proposed term with improvements and optimizations to the Triage process and ticket review/clean up practices as a new focus this term\n\nDeployment and Regression Testing\n\nGoals:\n\nTo catch 95% of prod issues during the deployment testing process.\n\nTo catch user facing issues in production environments in regression tests and #triage them accordingly.\n\nA deployment test is completed by the Operations Workstream during each release process and upon request in pre-deployment branch testing.\n\nSpecific regression tests are performed once a week by an Operations Workstream contributor to complete a full monthly regression testing schedule in accordance with regression testing best practices.\n\nOperations prioritize blocking bugs, supporting engineers, and efficiency in the processes already in place over chasing non-blocking bugs for a ‘perfected’ release.\n\nIn the 129 releases deployed since August 1, 2023, 0 total prod issues were experienced. 0 Production issue bugs in 129 releases = 100% \n\nKPIs:\n\n<2 Cadences missed per quarter due to bugs overlooked in Ops Testing (0 cadence missed last term)\n\n<2 Rollbacks during releases per quarter due to bugs overlooked in Ops Testing (0 Rollbacks occurred last term)\n\nDAO Admin Procedures and Practices\n\nGoals:\n\nTo organize successful DAO meetings related to Goat/No Goat, Retros, Ops Sprints, and AllFoxes.\n\nTo track, organize, record, and optimize DAO repos keeping them current and relevant. To help in cross workstream collaboration projects that optimize efficiency and collaborative, transparent communication.\n\nTo provide assistance in projects that require support in generating procedures to be completed for the DAO or other workstreams.\n\nKPIs:\n\nKeep All Workstream leaders and key contributors informed and involved in contributions to all Ops Sprints, Governance Calls, AllFoxes Slide decks, Go/No Gos, and Retros.\n\nCharacter limit about to be reached, Benefits and Drawbacks are listed at the bottom of the RFC post:https://forum.shapeshift.com/t/rfc-scp-tbd-renewing-the-operations-workstream-feb-july-2024/2918",

      "title": "SCP - 163 ShapeShift Dynamic Monetization Levers",
      "content": "## Summary:\n\nSCP 153 superseded SCP 128 leaving a gap in scope. This proposal formalizes the missing scope adding clarity for governance and workstreams. \n\nThis amendment builds upon the principles outlined in SCP-153, which introduced a parametric fee model for trade routes. As of Jan 2024 the volume on Shapeshift has grown and diversified, deferred far less revenue, churned little to no users, and proves the business model works as expected. Shapeshift DAO should double down building momentum for the future. \n\nThis amendment enables the selective application of discount/fee structure logic to any monetizable area within the ShapeShift's app(s) and extends the original scope with simpler fallbacks if needed. It also provides flexibility of choosing when and where to implement these  measures. This approach ensures a consistent and sustainable revenue model, while also adapting to market conditions, user preferences, or promotional activities.\n\nAs a result, this proposal enables monetization levers, aligning FOX governance and workstreams around shared success. It extends the authority of managing discount/fee parameters across workstreams for checks and balances.\n\nShapeShift *must* stay competitive for long-term survival.\n\n## Abstract:\n\n**Tl;dr Make it optional for teams to enable or disable discounts/fees when reasonable.**\n\nThis amendment expands SCP-153's discount/fee structure to all monetizable areas within ShapeShift's app(s) . It assigns parameter management to the Treasury Management and Diversification Committee (TMDC) and delegates implementation details, user impact, and market timing to the product and engineering workstreams.\n\n**Most importantly, this amendment improves the scope of SCP-153, permitting the selective enabling of discounts/fees, rather than applying them universally across all features.**\n\nThis amendment introduces default monetization parameters to SCP-153's list of parameters. We may not be able to use discounts on all features which could potentially confuse users across different offerings. Eventually these should be automated and derived from on-chain data\n\nThey are as follows:\n- `no_fee_threshold_usd`: This parameter, set at $1,000 USD, acts as the threshold below which no fees are applied, providing a user-friendly experience for smaller transactions.\n- `three_month_avg_bps`: Starting at 10 BPS, this parameter serves as the default basis point (BPS) fee for events where other parameters may not be applicable, ensuring a consistent fee structure.\n- `monetizeable_action_size_discount_threshold_usd`: A starting default parameter of $1,000,000 USD. This discount threshold remains flexible to accommodate various use cases within the app(s), whether it's a trade, deposit, withdraw, or other future action that hasn’t been created yet.\n\nThese default are designed for a balanced and adaptable discount/fee structure. They offer flexibility, consistency, and a user-centric approach to discounts/fees management.\n\nAn ancillary benefit is simplifying the user experience and reducing implementation headaches.\n\n## Motivation:\n\nThis amendment aims to establish a flexible, adaptive, and sustainable discount/fee structure responsive to market dynamics. By clearly stating our intentions while avoiding excessive detail, we prevent the need for frequent new proposals, thereby avoiding missed opportunities and governance fatigue. It aligns our commitments, adapting to market changes while maintaining a diplomatic approach to community engagement and it reduces headaches arguing over specific wording of other proposals. This proposal seeks to make functionality and responsibilities more explicit/decentralized avoiding delays and ensuring the efficient operation of monetization efforts.\n\n**Extending the discount/fee structure to more app(s) features streamlines decision-making and quickly captures revenue opportunities.**\n\nCrucial to this amendment is the built-in flexibility to deactivate unsuccessful monetization efforts or launch promotional campaigns incentivizing specific app(s) functionality. This approach allows us to remain competitive, respond to user feedback, and make strategic decisions  serving both the DAO and our users. \n\n## Specification:\n\nWhen feasible, extend SCP-153's parameters or utilize the default monetization parameters on all surfaces of the ShapeShift app(s), including but not limited to, the following (with examples):\n\n- **Additional Trade Routes and Trade Features**: This extension applies to trade routes and trade features that have not yet been launched, allowing them to benefit from the same discount/fee structure logic reducing engineering complexity.\n\t- E.g., Portals/zaps/shifts\n- **DeFi Functionality**: DeFi functionalities such as Thorchain savers, any/all DeFi protocol pool deposit/withdraws including advanced liquidity functionality (regardless of origin chain or transaction complexity), staking/unstaking, rehypothecation, smart contract wallet bundles, and minting will also be subject to the extended discount/fee structure scope.\n\t- E.g., Thorchain savers would ideally use the FOX discount parameters but, if too heavy, we would experiment for 6 weeks with the 10 BPS default. If users withdraw then it would turn off. TMDC and product would monitor the usage and capital flows.\n- **Future Monetizable Features**: Any new features introduced in the app(s) that have a relevant business case for monetization are eligible for SCP-153 discount/fee structure or monetizable action parameters.\n\nThe proposed discount/fee structure, as outlined in SCP-153 and expanded in this amendment creates a structured pipeline of responsibility:\n\n### TMDC (Treasury Management and Diversification Committee): \nTMDC plays a pivotal role in researching and recommending parameter changes in collaboration with Product and Engineering workstreams. Through research, recommendations, and ultimately voting they maintain a robust system of checks and balances. Fostering adaptability while ensuring user experience and DAO health.\n\n- The TMDC shall utilize research, recommendations, and votes for managing the same Discount/Fee parameters as in 153 across any newly implemented feature: \n\t- `fox_max_discount_threshold` = 1_000_000  # Maximum FOX held for 100% discount \n\t- `no_fee_threshold_usd` = 1_000 # USD    \n\t- `max_fee_bps` = 29 # bps - what fees start at    \n\t- `min_fee_bps` = 10 # bps - what fees go down to, if you don't hold any FOX    \n\t- `midpoint_usd` = 150_000 # USD - the \"knee\" of the fee curve    \n\t- `steepness` = 40_000 # unitless - the steepness of the fee curve (edited)    \n\n- If the Discount/fee parameters are not applicable, or too heavy, TMDC shall manage the following monetizable action parameters:\n    - `no_fee_threshold_usd` = 1_000 # USD starting default parameter \n\t- `three_month_avg_bps_` = 10 BPS # starting default parameter \n\t- `monetizeable_action_size_discount_threshold` = 1_000_000  USD # starting default parameter\n\n- After a discussion and evaluation, TMDC shall finalize the following on a vote in the [discord channel](https://discord.com/channels/554694662431178782/920449863408287855):\n\t- `Feature.name`\n\t- `Parameters applied`\n\t- `Parameter name`\n\t- `Value`\n\n- As the primary body managing fee parameters for now, the TMDC should oversee the financial and strategic outcomes of the changes leading & monitoring success/failure metrics like: \n\t- Revenue growth or decline\n\t- Unique addresses engaging onchain\n\t- Market share growth or decline\n\t- Changes in user balances over time\n\t- Traction, or conversly, any implementation negatively impacting KPIs.\n\n### Product/Marketing: \nThe Product/MKBD workstream actively collaborates with TMDC determining the practical implementation of fee parameters, user impact, research, and market timing. They work together on meeting market demand effectively and proposing parameter adjustments.\n- Responsible for monitoring user engagement and feedback to parameter changes.\n- Responsible for monitoring the adoption of new features, the churn rate, and the effects of implementing a fee, discount, promotion, or combination therein.\n- Responsible for proposing any adjustments alongside TMDC.\n- Pending team bandwidth, product or the TMDC shall post parameter change outcomes on the forum once a quarter.\n\n### Engineering: \n \n Engineering works closely with TMDC and Product to translate the approved parameters into technical implementations. \n *  They ensure the seamless integration of discount/fee structures across different app(s) features and functionalities.\n * They surface blockers early.\n\n\n## Benefits:\n\nThis amendment offers enhanced clarity and:\n\n- Ensures consistency in the discount/fee structure across all monetizable areas of the Shapeshift product suite.\n- Unblocks revenue potential by applying proven fee logic to new features with a backup of minimal revenue on by default.\n- Less management since the parameter math is the same and the backups are simple.\n- Allows for ongoing assessment and management of feature performance.\n- Provides transparency and clarity in revenue generation.\n- Utilizes cross-workstream accountability to put users first and listen to onchain data.\n\n## Drawbacks: \n\n- There may be unknown technical implementation complexity.\n- We may not be able to use discounts on all features which could potentially confuse users across different offerings.\n- TMDC is sufficient but not complete decentralization. Market driven on chain data with dynamic adjustments preferred.\n\n**For**:  Formalizes the community is “for” the details in this amendment proposal.  Including the optionality of setting monetization parameters, the management therein, and the additional scope.\n**Against**:  Formalizes the community is “against” the proposal.",

      "title": "[Ideation] SCP-162: A Decentralized Process for Hiring Workstream Leaders",
      "content": "## Summary\nThis proposal aims to establish a formal process for hiring into leadership roles at the DAO. The 8-step process outlined below has been constructed to provide a mechanism to ensure that the concerns of all parties at the DAO may be considered, ensure transparency at all times during the selection process, and allow for a candidate to be elected democratically. By ensuring that all concerned parties have the opportunity to voice their concerns and influence the candidate selection by voting in accordance with their views, the DAO may better equip itself to elect the best choice from the pool of available applicants for any vacant leadership position.\n\n## Abstract\nWith the expanded scope of authority granted to workstream leaders by SCP-92 and subsequent superseding proposals, workstream leaders at ShapeShift DAO have an outsized impact on the strategic trajectory of the DAO, its internal operations, and its cultural environment. The influence of any workstream leader extends well beyond the team that he/she is responsible for overseeing, and workstream leaders at ShapeShift DAO have historically had opportunities to assist in organization-wide decision-making processes often far outside the specific domain of his/her technical expertise. As such, it is of critical importance that ShapeShift DAO exercise great care in choosing individuals for leadership roles. Once a candidate has been hired into a leadership role, it is also important that the community is able to retain confidence that an appropriate candidate was elected through a process that is fair, transparent, and democratic - a process that allows the entire community to participate in the hiring process and make their opinions heard. This proposal aims to establish a mechanism that will preserve the DAO’s ability to exercise collective agency, self-organize, and self-direct.\n\n## Motivation\nNo formalized process for hiring workstream leaders currently exists. Furthermore, the process has historically only provided the opportunity for DAO-wide input on the hiring decision in the form of a binary “for/against” vote offered to the community for a single candidate. Effectively, the DAO has not been given the opportunity to elect a candidate for these roles, but instead presented only with the option to veto a selection previously made by a small number of DAO members through an opaque process with unknown selection criteria. This proposal aims to formalize a democratic process that simultaneously satisfies the concerns of both ShapeShift DAO leadership and the community at large.\n\n## Specification\nThis proposal outlines the following process for conducting hires for all leadership roles at ShapeShift DAO. These steps are to be taken in order. Should this proposal pass, this policy will go into effect immediately; any ongoing hiring process must be modified to comply with this specification.\n\n1.) For every open leadership position, an ad-hoc application review committee shall be established. The application review committee should include, but shall not be limited to, members from the workstream that the new hire will oversee.\n\n2.) The application review committee shall draft and publish to the ShapeShift Forum a well-defined job description before accepting applications for the role. The job description should outline the responsibilities, expectations, and technical prerequisites required for the position. Optionally, the application review committee may compile a technical screening examination, which will be used to assess the technical abilities of prospective candidates. If the application review committee chooses to give a technical screening examination to applicants during the application review process, the contents of the technical screening examination must be published to the ShapeShift Forum immediately after all qualifying applicants have completed their initial interviews.\n\n3.) Upon publication of the job description, application submissions shall be accepted for a pre-determined period, as established by the application review committee.\n\n4.) Once the application acceptance period has expired, the application review committee may begin screening applicants. All applicants who meet the criteria outlined in the job description and have passed the technical examination (if one was given) shall advance to the initial interview round.\n\n5.) A group of interviewers selected internally by the application review committee shall conduct a recorded video interview with each applicant who has advanced to the initial interview round. Neither the interviewers nor applicants shall be required to show their faces on camera during the recorded video interview. This interview is meant to assess the behavioral, cultural, (and optionally, technical) attributes of the applicant. During the interview, interviewers from the application review committee shall take notes on the performance of each applicant. The notes may describe the applicant’s strengths and weaknesses and may contain a hiring recommendation from any or all of the interviewers present during the interview.\n\n6.) Once all applicants have been interviewed by the application review committee, the application review committee shall post a proposal with the title “[SCP-XXX]: Selecting Candidates for the Role of ”. This proposal must contain the (optionally redacted) resume of each applicant, along with the applicant’s recorded video interview and interview notes from the application review committee. This proposal must utilize the Snapshot weighted voting strategy, with options listed for each applicant interviewed by the application review committee. This proposal shall bypass the RFC stage and advance directly to ideation. This strategy will allow voters to split their voting power among any number of applicant choices. Upon expiry of the voting period, the applicants with the three highest vote counts will advance to the next interview round. If three or fewer applicants are available, this step may be skipped with all applicants advancing to the next interview round.\n\n7.) Each candidate advancing from the previous round will host an AMA session on Discord. During the AMA session, the candidate will have an opportunity to make a personal introduction to the community, and members of the community will have an opportunity to ask the candidate questions of any variety.\n\n8.) Once all candidates have completed their AMA sessions, a final hire proposal shall be published by the application review committee with the title, “[SCP-XXX]: Electing a Candidate for the Role of ”. This proposal must utilize the Snapshot basic voting strategy, with options listed for each candidate who advanced from the previous round. This proposal shall bypass the RFC stage and advance directly to ideation. During the time that this proposal is active, community members may vote for one of the remaining candidates. The candidate who has received the greatest number of votes at the time that the voting period ends shall be elected to the position. In the unlikely event of a tie between the two top candidates at the end of the voting period, the candidates shall conduct a joint AMA debate session, and a subsequent final hire proposal listing only these two candidates shall be presented to the community. The leading candidate from this proposal shall be elected to the position.\n\n### Privacy Considerations\n\nSeveral conceivable situations could arise in which the candidates might wish to maintain more privacy than allowed by the process as written above. For instance, a candidate who is currently employed elsewhere in the industry might reasonably not wish for his/her application to be published to the ShapeShift Forum during the interview process. To account for this and similar situations, any applicant may elect to interview anonymously. In this event, the candidate will be referred to in all materials published by the application review committee under an alias, information about the applicant’s current employer will be redacted from the published resume, and the recorded video interviews may either be published without the face of the applicant shown or as audio-only files.\n\n## Benefits\nThe policy above provides increased transparency during candidate evaluation and democratizes the candidate selection process, enabling the community of FOX holders to self-organize and self-direct by electing candidates that the community believes will be best suited for leadership roles at the DAO.\n\nWith this process, the application review committee has the opportunity to make a strong case for or against any applicant, but the final selection will be determined by the community, with all options available at the time of voting.\n\nLikewise, any member of the DAO will be able to make a case to the community as to why they believe that any particular candidate is or is not well-suited for the position. This ensures that the community can consider all available opinions regarding candidate selection and may make a well-informed decision on which candidate is best suited for the leadership role.\n\nThe mandatory AMA sessions outlined in the specification above will provide the community with an opportunity to assess the candidates’ personality traits, allow the community to evaluate the candidates for culture fit, and will give the community information on the candidates’ viewpoints regarding strategic decision-making. Productivity can be optimized if this information can be gleaned ahead of the hiring decision rather than afterward.\n\n## Drawbacks\nThe process outlined above requires that the application review committee manage recorded interviews, applicant information, and review notes during the interview process.\n\nThe proposed hiring process also requires that two proposals be presented to the community to elect a candidate instead of the single proposal typically presented at the end of the informal process currently used in practice",

      "title": "[Ideation] SCP - 163 ShapeShift Dynamic Monetization Levers",
      "content": "## Summary:\n\nSCP 153 superseded SCP 128 leaving a gap in scope. This proposal formalizes the missing scope adding clarity for governance and workstreams. \n\nThe proposed amendment builds upon the principles outlined in SCP-153, which introduced a parametric fee model for trade routes. As of Jan 2024 the volume on Shapeshift has not only continued to grow but diversify, proving the business model works as expected. Shapeshift DAO should double down on this success. \n\nThis amendment enables the selective application of discount/fee structure logic to any monetizable area within the ShapeShift app, providing us with the flexibility to choose when and where to implement these measures. This approach ensures that we can maintain a consistent and sustainable revenue model, while also having the discretion to adapt to market conditions, user preferences, or promotional activities.\n\nAs a result, this proposal enables monetization levers, aligning FOX governance and workstreams around shared success. It extends the authority of managing discount/fee parameters across workstreams for checks and balances.\n\nShapeShift *must* stay competitive for long-term survival.\n## Abstract:\n\n**Tl;dr Make it optional for teams to enable or disable discounts/fees when reasonable.**\n\nThis amendment expands SCP-153's discount/fee structure to all monetizable ShapeShift app areas. It assigns parameter management to the Treasury Management and Diversification Committee (TMDC) and delegates implementation details, user impact, and market timing to the product and engineering workstreams.\n\n**Most importantly, this amendment broadens the scope of SCP-153, permitting the selective enabling of discounts/fees, rather than applying them universally across all features.**\n\nThis amendment introduces default monetization parameters to the SCP-153 list of parameters. Eventually these should be automated and derived from on-chain data:  \n\n- `no_fee_threshold_usd`: This parameter, set at $1,000 USD, acts as the threshold below which no fees are applied, providing a user-friendly experience for smaller transactions.\n- `three_month_avg_bps`: Starting at 10 BPS, this parameter serves as the default basis point (BPS) fee for events where other parameters may not be applicable, ensuring a consistent fee structure.\n- `monetizeable_action_size_discount_threshold_usd`: With a starting default parameter of $1,000,000 USD for free. This discount threshold remains flexible to accommodate various use cases within the app, whether it's a trade, deposit, withdraw, or other future action that hasn’t been created yet.   \n\nThese default monetization parameters are designed to maintain a balanced and adaptable discount/fee structure. They offer flexibility while ensuring a consistent and user-centric approach to fee management.  \n\nAn ancillary benefit to this amendment is that it simplifies the user experience and reduces implementation headaches.   \n\n## Motivation:\n\nThis amendment aims to establish a flexible, adaptive discount/fee structure responsive to market dynamics. By clearly stating our intentions while avoiding excessive detail, we prevent the need for frequent new proposals, thereby avoiding missed opportunities and governance fatigue. This proposal seeks to make functionality and responsibilities more explicit/decentralized.   \n\nWe recognize the importance of avoiding delays and ensuring the efficient operation of monetization efforts. This amendment seeks to strike a balance between sustainability and agility.   \n\n**Extending the structure to more app features streamlines decision-making and quickly captures revenue opportunities.**  \n\nIt aligns our commitments, adapting to market changes while maintaining a diplomatic approach to community engagement and it reduces headaches arguing over specific wording of other proposals. Additionally, it makes implementations much clearer, reducing shipping complexity.   \n\nCrucial to this amendment is the built-in flexibility to deactivate unsuccessful monetization efforts or launch promotional campaigns incentivizing specific app functionality. This approach allows us to remain competitive, respond to user feedback, and make strategic decisions that best serve both the DAO and our users. \n\n## Specification:\n\nWhen feasible, extend SCP-153's parameters or utilize the default monetization parameters to all surfaces of the ShapeShift app, including but is not limited to, the following (with examples):\n\n- **Additional Trade Routes and Trade Features**: This extension applies to trade routes and trade features that have not yet been launched, allowing them to benefit from the same discount/fee structure logic reducing engineering complexity.\n\t- E.g., Portals/zaps/shifts\n- **DeFi Functionality**: DeFi functionalities such as Thorchain savers, any/all DeFi protocol pool deposit/withdraws including advanced liquidity functionality (regardless of origin chain or transaction complexity), staking/unstaking rehypothecation, smart contract wallet bundles, and minting will also be subject to the extended discount/fee structure scope.\n\t- E.g., Thorchain savers would ideally use the FOX discount parameters but, if too heavy, we would experiment for 6 weeks with the 10 BPS default, if users withdraw then it would turn off. TMDC and product would monitor the usage and capital flows.\n- **Future Monetizable Features**: Any new features introduced in the app that have a relevant business case for monetization are eligible for SCP-153 discount/fee structure or monetizable action parameters.\n\nThe proposed discount/fee structure, as outlined in SCP-153 and expanded in this amendment creates a structured pipeline of responsibility:\n\n- TMDC (Treasury Management and Diversification Committee): TMDC plays a pivotal role in researching and recommending parameter changes in collaboration with Product and Engineering workstreams. Through research, votes, and recommendations, they maintain a robust system of checks and balances. Fostering adaptability while ensuring user experience and DAO health.\n\n- The TMDC shall utilize research, votes, and recommendations for managing the same Discount/Fee parameters as in 153 across any newly implemented feature: \n\t- `fox_max_discount_threshold` = 1_000_000  # Maximum FOX held for 100% discount \n\t- `no_fee_threshold_usd` = 1_000 # USD    \n\t- `max_fee_bps` = 29 # bps - what fees start at    \n\t- `min_fee_bps` = 10 # bps - what fees go down to, if you don't hold any FOX    \n\t- `midpoint_usd` = 150_000 # USD - the \"knee\" of the fee curve    \n\t- `steepness` = 40_000 # unitless - the steepness of the fee curve (edited)    \n\n- If the Discount/fee parameters are not applicable or too heavy, TMDC shall manage monetizable action parameters:\n    - `no_fee_threshold_usd` = 1_000 # USD\n\t- `three_month_avg_bps_` = 10 BPS # starting default parameter \n\t- `monetizeable_action_size_discount_threshold` = 1_000_000  # starting default parameter\n\n- TMDC may propose adjusting, adding, or removing parameters as features deploy and gain more traction or negatively impact KPIs.\n    \n- As the primary body managing fee parameters, the TMDC should oversee the financial and strategic outcomes of the changes leading and building out monitoring for success metrics like: \n\t- Revenue growth    \n\t- Unique addresses engaging onchain    \n\t- Market share growth or decline    \n\t- Changes in user balances over time\n\n- Product: The Product workstream actively collaborates with TMDC to determine the practical implementation of fee parameters, user impact, and market timing. They work together on meeting market demand effectively.  \n\t- Responsible for monitoring user engagement and feedback    \n\t- Responsible for monitoring the adoption of new features, the churn rate, and the effects of implementing a fee, discount, promotion, or combination therein.\n\n- Engineering: Engineering works closely with TMDC and Product to translate the approved parameters into technical implementations or surfacing blockers. They ensure the seamless integration of discount/fee structures across different app features and functionalities.\n## Benefits:\n\nThis amendment offers enhanced clarity alongside several benefits:\n\n- Ensures consistency in the discount/fee structure across all monetizable areas of the app.     \n- Unblocks revenue potential by applying proven fee logic to new features with a backup of minimal revenue on by default.     \n- Less management since the parameter math is the same and the backups are simple.    \n- Allows for ongoing assessment and management of feature performance.    \n- Provides transparency and clarity in revenue generation methods.    \n- Utilizes cross-workstream accountability to put users first and listen to onchain data.\n\nBy extending the discount/fee structure logic to all areas of the app and granting the relevant authorities the ability to assess and remove non-performing features, the DAO can create a robust and sustainable financial model that supports its long-term objectives.\n\n## Drawbacks: \n\n- There may be unknown technical implementation complexity.    \n- We may not be able to use discounts on all features which could potentially confuse users across different offerings.    \n- TMDC is sufficient but not complete decentralization. Market driven smart contract oracles preferred.    \n\n**For**:  Formalizes the community is “for” the details in this amendment proposal. Including the optionality of setting monetization parameters, the management therein, and the additional scope.\n**For with amendments/changes**: Acknowledges the proposals main points requesting some additions incorporated before final vote.\n**Against**:  Formalizes the community is “against” the proposal.",

      "title": "[Ideation] SCP-164: MKBD Workstream Renewal",
      "content": "## Summary\n\nThis proposal seeks to renew and expand the ShapeShift DAO's MKBD Workstream for the next six months, starting February 1, 2024. This proposal will:\n- Extend the existing team for the next 6-month term\n- Incorporate the FKA \"Globalization\" workstream into MKBD\n- Update workstream responsibilities and KPIs\n\nEssential tasks under the new MKBD team include product copywriting, co-marketing, partnership management, grants, external sales, and general marketing strategy and execution across a global landscape. This approach will save the DAO $93,525 over six months while utilizing existing top talent more efficiently for new market expansion.\n\n## Abstract/Summary\n\n- Integrate \"Globalization\" into the MKBD team.\n- Focus: Product copywriting, co-marketing, partnership management, grants, sales, and global strategy.\n- Enhanced KPIs reflect new responsibilities.\n\n**Financials:**\n- Net savings: $93,525 over six months.\n- MKBD monthly spend increase: $2,563 (Total increase: $15,375 over six months).\n- Monthly DAO spending decrease: $15,588 per month.\n- Net total spend decrease: 40.50%.\n\n**Budget Allocation:**\n- Fixed labor costs increase: 10.88%.\n- Discontinuation of \"Globalization Workstream\" (savings: $93,525 over six months).\n\n**Strategic Goals & KPIs:**\n- Enhance brand and customer base through partnerships and user engagement.\n- Key targets: $150M trade volume monthly, 30% improvement in top-of-funnel engagement.\n\n**Key Deliverables:**\n- Partnership management, user acquisition, content strategy, grants, and targeted international outreach.\n\nThis proposal adopts SCP-92 Definition of Workstream Leader.\n\n## Motivation\n\nThe Marketing workstream has shown what it can creatively accomplish with a minimal marketing budget for the past year. With the idea of continuing to operate in a lean, mean, and creative spirit, the MKBD team can provide the DAO with more targeted value and efficiency.\n\nMKBD achieved most of our goals while adding and successfully executing new responsibilities.\n\nTotal prior labor, marketing, and overhead spending was $154,500 over six months. This proposal increases the monthly MKBD spend by $2,563 (a $15,375 6-month increase) while decreasing total DAO spend by $15,588 per month (saving $93,525 over six months) by eliminating the need for the DAO to fund the Globalization workstream, as some of its existing high-performing members will be wrapped under MKBD. \n\nThis effectively saves $93,525 over the next six months一reducing runway burn by $15,588 per month while aligning DAO global and contributors under one leader, increasing the velocity, quality, scope, and accuracy of activations, messaging, and partnerships to align better with Product and Engineering.\n\nMKBD will continue to pursue limited grant opportunities as we saw success in narrowing the scope of grants to a limited set that directly supported the Product and Marketing Workstream roadmaps. Renewing this proposal will allow the existing team to lean into further refining goals and actions based on past learnings.\n\nThe DAO will still retain a reasonably globally translated and accessible application, and there will be no unreasonable downtime in keeping the DAO's products and messaging accessible to users around the globe.\n\n## Specification\n\n### Budget\n\nThe details below expand upon the budget spreadsheet:\n[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QoQKcd_gBHiCk9Qrg-7FDlSXC92mfg5D72Rc_Ui5iYs/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QoQKcd_gBHiCk9Qrg-7FDlSXC92mfg5D72Rc_Ui5iYs/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n**TLDR:**\n- Total Fixed labor + tooling costs: 10.88% increase ($15,375 over six months) from SCP-144\n- Eliminates the need to fund the FKA “Globalization Workstream” ($93,525 saved over six months) => net spending decrease of 40.50% between the two workstreams.\n- (see: Green line vs. Yellow Line in image below)\n![Q1 Budget.png](ipfs://bafkreibcr76mynczllcprnuj3hxibzyutaptf35a22aciloxkpg3l5yjda)\n    \n### Recurring Costs\n\n#### Labor\nThe marketing workstream lead (Hpayne) fully adopts SCP-92 in this proposal. All newly added contributors to the workstream will be tasked with developing their own PIP (Personal Improvement Plan) to help onboard, hold accountable, and grow the team foundationally as the team merges.\n\nThese PIPs will accompany a weekly update that is candid, honest, and forward-looking with the spirit of seeking improvement, efficiency, and balance. \n\nShould the PIP be unsatisfactorily followed or executed, the contributor will be informed explicitly of the areas of improvement and given specific steps to improve. If the contributor is not performing satisfactorily, the workstream lead reserves the right to utilize SCP-92 and eliminate the position.\n\nAs it stands, the budget includes four full-time contributors:\n- Hpayne (Workstream Lead) \n- Atlan (Designer and Graphics) \n- TheSmith (International User Acquisition)\n- Vlad (Growth Engagement Lead)\n\nAdditionally, there are two part-time contributors:\n- Twells (Marketing Communications Lead)\n- Firebomb (International UX and Translations Lead)\n\n#### Tooling\n**TLDR:** This budget seeks approval for the commitment of $12,000 USDC and $22,500 FOX for non-recurring costs to be spent judiciously at the workstream’s discretion, should it be required.\n\nThis budgetary item is provisional, and any unspent funds will be rolled over into the next proposal cycle to mitigate future budgetary asks.\n\nAny unused funds from any budget category will be kept in the workstream Colony and rolled over into the following proposal.\n\nA separate governance proposal shall be raised if the Marketing Workstream requires more funds.\n\n### Deliverables\n\n#### KPIs\n\n**Core KPI TLDR:**\nThe MKBD Workstream will focus on KPIs that directly support the Product and Engineering roadmap and continue to build and proliferate the ShapeShift brand while driving meaningful revenue back to the DAO.\n\n**Strategic Marketing Goals Proposal for ShapeShift**\n\n**Objective:** To enhance brand presence, customer base, and overall performance through targeted marketing initiatives aligned with key performance indicators.\n\nI. **Expand and Deepen Strategic Partnerships:**\n- Goal: Deeply collaborate with nine key industry players (MetaMask, OnRamper, Ledger, CoWSwap, THORChain, Arbitrum, Gnosis chain, Optimism, LiFi) to boost brand exposure and optimize service usage inside app.shapeshift.com. \n- Stretch: Additional four partners to consider: Eigenlayer, Maya Protocol, xDeFi, Coinbase, Keplr, or additional as deemed appropriate.\n- KPI Measurement: Success of this goal would mean each partner has done three of the four objectives:\n    1. Activated and coordinated with ShapeShift Marketing messaging\n    2. Collaborated with the Product Workstream to give feedback on app feature implementation\n    3. Has a POC the DAO can tap reliably (within one week) for answers and feedback on app\n    4. Collaborated with BD team and passed to appropriate workstream (Tokenomics, engineering, etc) for further nurturing\n\nII. **Boost Transacting User Acquisition:**\n- Goal: Acquire new mid- to high-value customers who individually trade $3,500 - $5,000 per month on average within the next six months—northstar goal of $150MM monthly volume through the swapper.\n- KPI Measurement: Daily Active Users (DAU) / Weekly Active Users (WAU) / Monthly Active Users (MAU).\n\nIII. **Boost User Acquisition:**\n- Goal: Acquire new customers who connect a wallet to app.shapeshift.com. Failure: 60,000 new connections, success: 80,000 new connections, growth: 100,0000 new connections (per month)\n- KPI Measurement: Monthly sessions, monthly visitors.\n\nIV. **Increase Customer Engagement:**\n- Goal: Enhance customer engagement by working alongside the Product workstream to reduce churn and increase on-chain interactions in-app.\n- KPI Measurement: Correlation Analysis & Conversion Funnel Analysis.\n\nV. **Optimize Content Impact:**\n- Goal: Improve top-of-funnel engagement by 30% and inbound traffic by 50% in the next six months.\n- KPI Measurement: Growth Rate of Unique On-Chain Addresses  & impressions per month via X, Medium, PUSH, Discord & Blaze\n\nVI. **Engage new International Community:**\n- Goal: Engage and activate with the Indian community to foster, activate, and convert potential customers into ShapeShift community members and dedicated power users.\n- KPI Measurement: Onchain interactions and conversions from mixpanel, UTM tracking, and depth of engagement on social channels.\n\nVII. **Engage with grant ecosystems**\n- Goal: Engage with at least two top-identified crypto ecosystems or partners to research, develop, manage, and secure two grants totaling at least $50,000 of vested and unvested tokens.\n- Stretch: Engage with four crypto ecosystems partners to secure $100,000 in funding\n- KPI Measurement: Onchain interactions with DAO wallets.\n\n## Drawbacks\n\nMarketing labor and spending has the potential to be the most elusive to quantify and qualify within the DAO’s budget, which is why we outlined our goals, spending, and reporting metrics while keeping in mind brevity. Any aspect of these goals, metrics, and activations that do not seem appropriate to serve the needs and goals of the DAO or support the Product and Engineering Workstreams effort should be questioned.\n\n## Benefits\n\nThe MKBD effort markets, grows, and sells the ShapeShift product usage and awareness while retaining, strengthening, and enhancing the voice and brand image. Marketing and Business Development exist to scale and create opportunities for the ShapeShift product in dynamic markets. \n\n## Vote\n\nFor - Formalizes the community is “for” the details outlined in this proposal\n\nFor (with changes) - Formalizes the community is “for” the details outlined in the proposal with SPECIFIC changes outlined on the furm\n\nAgainst - Formalizes the community is “against” the proposal",

      "title": "SCP-162: A Decentralized Process for Hiring Workstream Leaders",
      "content": "## Summary\nThis proposal aims to establish a formal process for hiring into leadership roles at the DAO. The 8-step process outlined below has been constructed to provide a mechanism to ensure that the concerns of all parties at the DAO may be considered, ensure transparency at all times during the selection process, and allow for a candidate to be elected democratically. By ensuring that all concerned parties have the opportunity to voice their concerns and influence the candidate selection by voting in accordance with their views, the DAO may better equip itself to elect the best choice from the pool of available applicants for any vacant leadership position.\n\n## Abstract\nWith the expanded scope of authority granted to workstream leaders by SCP-92 and subsequent superseding proposals, workstream leaders at ShapeShift DAO have an outsized impact on the strategic trajectory of the DAO, its internal operations, and its cultural environment. The influence of any workstream leader extends well beyond the team that he/she is responsible for overseeing, and workstream leaders at ShapeShift DAO have historically had opportunities to assist in organization-wide decision-making processes often far outside the specific domain of his/her technical expertise. As such, it is of critical importance that ShapeShift DAO exercise great care in choosing individuals for leadership roles. Once a candidate has been hired into a leadership role, it is also important that the community is able to retain confidence that an appropriate candidate was elected through a process that is fair, transparent, and democratic - a process that allows the entire community to participate in the hiring process and make their opinions heard. This proposal aims to establish a mechanism that will preserve the DAO’s ability to exercise collective agency, self-organize, and self-direct.\n\n## Motivation\nNo formalized process for hiring workstream leaders currently exists. Furthermore, the process has historically only provided the opportunity for DAO-wide input on the hiring decision in the form of a binary “for/against” vote offered to the community for a single candidate. Effectively, the DAO has not been given the opportunity to elect a candidate for these roles, but instead presented only with the option to veto a selection previously made by a small number of DAO members through an opaque process with unknown selection criteria. This proposal aims to formalize a democratic process that simultaneously satisfies the concerns of both ShapeShift DAO leadership and the community at large.\n\n## Specification\nThis proposal outlines the following process for conducting hires for all leadership roles at ShapeShift DAO. These steps are to be taken in order. Should this proposal pass, this policy will go into effect immediately; any ongoing hiring process must be modified to comply with this specification.\n\n1. For every open leadership position, an ad-hoc application review committee shall be established. The application review committee should include, but shall not be limited to, members from the workstream that the new hire will oversee.\n\n2. The application review committee shall draft and publish to the ShapeShift Forum a well-defined job description before accepting applications for the role. The job description should outline the responsibilities, expectations, and technical prerequisites required for the position. Optionally, the application review committee may compile a technical screening examination, which will be used to assess the technical abilities of prospective candidates. If the application review committee chooses to give a technical screening examination to applicants during the application review process, the contents of the technical screening examination must be published to the ShapeShift Forum immediately after all qualifying applicants have completed their initial interviews.\n\n3. Upon publication of the job description, application submissions shall be accepted for a pre-determined period, as established by the application review committee.\n\n4. Once the application acceptance period has expired, the application review committee may begin screening applicants. All applicants who meet the criteria outlined in the job description and have passed the technical examination (if one was given) shall advance to the initial interview round.\n\n5. A group of interviewers selected internally by the application review committee shall conduct a recorded video interview with each applicant who has advanced to the initial interview round. Neither the interviewers nor applicants shall be required to show their faces on camera during the recorded video interview. This interview is meant to assess the behavioral, cultural, (and optionally, technical) attributes of the applicant. During the interview, interviewers from the application review committee shall take notes on the performance of each applicant. The notes may describe the applicant’s strengths and weaknesses and may contain a hiring recommendation from any or all of the interviewers present during the interview.\n\n6. Once all applicants have been interviewed by the application review committee, the application review committee shall post a proposal with the title “[SCP-XXX]: Selecting Candidates for the Role of ”. This proposal must contain the (optionally redacted) resume of each applicant, along with the applicant’s recorded video interview and interview notes from the application review committee. This proposal must utilize the Snapshot weighted voting strategy, with options listed for each applicant interviewed by the application review committee. This proposal shall bypass the RFC stage and advance directly to ideation. This strategy will allow voters to split their voting power among any number of applicant choices. Upon expiry of the voting period, the applicants with the three highest vote counts will advance to the next interview round. If three or fewer applicants are available, this step may be skipped with all applicants advancing to the next interview round.\n\n7. Each candidate advancing from the previous round will host an AMA session on Discord. During the AMA session, the candidate will have an opportunity to make a personal introduction to the community, and members of the community will have an opportunity to ask the candidate questions of any variety.\n\n8. Once all candidates have completed their AMA sessions, a final hire proposal shall be published by the application review committee with the title, “[SCP-XXX]: Electing a Candidate for the Role of ”. This proposal must utilize the Snapshot basic voting strategy, with options listed for each candidate who advanced from the previous round. This proposal shall bypass the RFC stage and advance directly to ideation. During the time that this proposal is active, community members may vote for one of the remaining candidates. The candidate who has received the greatest number of votes at the time that the voting period ends shall be elected to the position. In the unlikely event of a tie between the two top candidates at the end of the voting period, the candidates shall conduct a joint AMA debate session, and a subsequent final hire proposal listing only these two candidates shall be presented to the community. The leading candidate from this proposal shall be elected to the position.\n\n### Privacy Considerations\n\nSeveral conceivable situations could arise in which the candidates might wish to maintain more privacy than allowed by the process as written above. For instance, a candidate who is currently employed elsewhere in the industry might reasonably not wish for his/her application to be published to the ShapeShift Forum during the interview process. To account for this and similar situations, any applicant may elect to interview anonymously. In this event, the candidate will be referred to in all materials published by the application review committee under an alias, information about the applicant’s current employer will be redacted from the published resume, and the recorded video interviews may either be published without the face of the applicant shown or as audio-only files.\n\n## Benefits\nThe policy above provides increased transparency during candidate evaluation and democratizes the candidate selection process, enabling the community of FOX holders to self-organize and self-direct by electing candidates that the community believes will be best suited for leadership roles at the DAO.\n\nWith this process, the application review committee has the opportunity to make a strong case for or against any applicant, but the final selection will be determined by the community, with all options available at the time of voting.\n\nLikewise, any member of the DAO will be able to make a case to the community as to why they believe that any particular candidate is or is not well-suited for the position. This ensures that the community can consider all available opinions regarding candidate selection and may make a well-informed decision on which candidate is best suited for the leadership role.\n\nThe mandatory AMA sessions outlined in the specification above will provide the community with an opportunity to assess the candidates’ personality traits, allow the community to evaluate the candidates for culture fit, and will give the community information on the candidates’ viewpoints regarding strategic decision-making. Productivity can be optimized if this information can be gleaned ahead of the hiring decision rather than afterward.\n\n## Drawbacks\nThe process outlined above requires that the application review committee manage recorded interviews, applicant information, and review notes during the interview process.\n\nThe proposed hiring process also requires that two proposals be presented to the community to elect a candidate instead of the single proposal typically presented at the end of the informal process currently used in practice.",

      "content": "#### Summary\n\n0xdef1cafe has resigned from his position as Engineering Workstream leader and per SCP-92 has appointed 0xean from the Fox Foundation as a temporary replacement until a full time replacement can be found. Per SCP-92, this also needs to be ratified by the community.\n\n#### Abstract\n\nShould this proposal pass, I will act as interim Engineering Workstream leader until a new workstream leader is voted in formally by governance or 3/31/2024 when the current budget expires\n\n#### Motivation\n\nTo provide continuity in engineering leadership to the excellent contributors that comprise the workstream. Per SCP-92 each workstream is required to have a workstream leader.\n\n#### Specification\n\nThe current engineering workstream [budget](https://snapshot.org/#/shapeshiftdao.eth/proposal/0x306dd79215c8463a59db06d3d2fd25cb3111b1305a62fe0bc16eda8a515c84ee) expires at the end of March 2024. This proposal would verify 0xdef1cafe’s appointment of myself as interim workstream leader until governance elects a new full-time leader. While I am happy to fill this role for as long as the DAO needs me, it is much preferable to find another long-term candidate.\n\n#### Benefits\n\n1. The engineering workstream continues delivering on the roadmap outlined by product with limited disruption as 0xdef1cafe departs from his role\n2. I will not be taking any salary from the DAO’s budget. I am already compensated for my role at the Fox Foundation and will be providing these services on behalf of the Foundation.\n3. I have a good understanding of our tech stack, our team, and a good working relationship with all of the stakeholders.\n4. The team and workstream leads have supported this transition so far.\n\n#### Drawbacks\n\n1. This is temporary and the team will eventually have to adapt to another new leader stepping in as soon as that person is voted in through governance.",

      "content": "[Ideation] SCP-161 Confirmation of 0xean’s appointment as interim Engineering Workstream Leader\n\n#### Summary\n\n0xdef1cafe has resigned from his position as Engineering Workstream leader and per SCP-92 has appointed 0xean from the Fox Foundation as a temporary replacement until a full time replacement can be found. Per SCP-92, this also needs to be ratified by the community.\n\n#### Abstract\n\nShould this proposal pass, I will act as interim Engineering Workstream leader until a new workstream leader is voted in formally by governance or 3/31/2024 when the current budget expires\n\n#### Motivation\n\nTo provide continuity in engineering leadership to the excellent contributors that comprise the workstream. Per SCP-92 each workstream is required to have a workstream leader.\n\n#### Specification\n\nThe current engineering workstream [budget](https://snapshot.org/#/shapeshiftdao.eth/proposal/0x306dd79215c8463a59db06d3d2fd25cb3111b1305a62fe0bc16eda8a515c84ee) expires at the end of March 2024. This proposal would verify 0xdef1cafe’s appointment of myself as interim workstream leader until governance elects a new full-time leader. While I am happy to fill this role for as long as the DAO needs me, it is much preferable to find another long-term candidate.\n\n#### Benefits\n\n1. The engineering workstream continues delivering on the roadmap outlined by product with limited disruption as 0xdef1cafe departs from his role\n2. I will not be taking any salary from the DAO’s budget. I am already compensated for my role at the Fox Foundation and will be providing these services on behalf of the Foundation.\n3. I have a good understanding of our tech stack, our team, and a good working relationship with all of the stakeholders.\n4. The team and workstream leads have supported this transition so far.\n\n#### Drawbacks\n\n1. This is temporary and the team will eventually have to adapt to another new leader stepping in as soon as that person is voted in through governance.",

      "title": "SCP 159: TMDC Revisions - Fall 2023",
      "content": "This proposal aims to address three critical issues within the Treasury Management and Diversification Committee (TMDC):\n\n - Replacement of @Kent with @GiantKin on the TMDC.\n - Decrease the quorum requirements for votes from 4 to 3.\n - Eliminate TMDC compensation for @ProfMcCarthy.\n\nSummary:\n\nThe proposed changes to the TMDC are as follows:\n\nMembership Change: To maintain a five-member TMDC, we propose adding @GiantKin, who had previously been considered in SCP 148 and is willing to serve. Notably, @FireB0mb1, another DAO member interested in joining the TMDC, has withdrawn his application and interest.\n\nQuorum Requirement Adjustment: This proposal recommends reducing the quorum requirements for TMDC votes from the current 4 to 3. This adjustment aims to expedite decision-making within the TMDC.\nEliminate TMDC Compensation for @ProfMcCarthy: The proposal suggests discontinuing compensation for @ProfMcCarthy.\n\nBackground:\n\nThe TMDC was initially established on a trial basis in SCP-36 in November 2021 and subsequently continued indefinitely by SCP-62 in February 2022. SCP 148 also oversaw the transfer of roles within the TMDC, as well as clarified its purview.\n\nUnder SCP 148, TMDC compensation was increased to 1,250 USD worth of FOX per month for each committee member, except for Kent, who did not accept compensation due to his role as tokenomics workstream leader.\n\nIf this proposal is approved, @GiantKin, as the fifth TMDC member, will also be compensated with 1,250 USD worth of FOX per month.\n\nThe reduction in quorum requirements from 4 to 3 is necessary to streamline TMDC decision-making, as achieving a quorum of 4 with only 4 members has proven challenging and has led to delays in critical matters, such as managing stablecoin holdings for payroll.\n\nFurthermore, this proposal will have a net-zero impact on FOX or stablecoin holdings. The decrease in 1,250 USD worth of FOX from ProfMccarthy no longer accepting compensation for their TMDC role will exactly offset the compensation to be given to @GiantKin for his role.\n\nMotivation:\n\nWith @Kent resigning from the committee, ensuring that the TMDC maintains adequate staffing is imperative. Reducing the quorum requirement will expedite decision-making, aligning with the TMDC's goal of providing timely recommendations for stablecoins, debt management, and asset diversification. Additionally, it is essential to clarify that, as the tokenomics workstream leader, @ProfMccarthy will no longer receive compensation for their role on the TMDC.\n\nBenefits:\n\nPassing this proposal will yield several advantages:\n\n - Ensures the TMDC maintains five voting members by welcoming @GiantKin as the fifth member.\n - Facilitates quicker decision-making by reducing the quorum requirements to 3.\n - Eliminates FOX compensation for @ProfMcCarthy effective when they start their role as tokenomics workstream leader.\n\nDrawbacks:\n\nThere are no drawbacks to this proposal beyond those inherent to the TMDC itself.",

      "title": "SCP 158: Grant authority to update DAO ENS Records to Product and Engineering Workstream Leaders",
      "content": "#### Summary\nCurrently the DAO has no process by which to update ENS records for its ENS name (shapeshiftdao.eth) other than through governance. This proposal would delegate the authority to update records associated with our ENS name to the leaders of the Product and Engineering workstreams.  Authority to modify the primary addresses for any blockchain would specifically not be included in this proposal.\n\n#### Abstract\nThe DAO’s ENS records must be updated by on-chain transactions originating from the Shapeshift DAO’s multisignature wallet. This proposal would allow the DAO’s signers to modify ENS records, with the exception of primary addresses, at the request of either the Product or Engineering workstream leader. This will allow for us to utilize these records to the benefit of the Shapeshift application and the DAO without requiring a governance approval for each modification.\n\n#### Motivation\nThe ShapeShift application has been re-deployed to fleek’s new platform (fleek.xyz).  This deployment, currently available at fleek.shapeshift.com, offers a more decentralized alternative to our CloudFlare hosted app (app.shapeshift.com). The content hash records associated with our ENS domain are currently serving a version of the application that was released in January of 2023 and should be updated.  Recently introduced changes into our build pipeline will ensure that the fleek deployment will always mirror the current version of the primary application. By delegating the authority to update our ENS records to these workstream leaders we can update the content hash record so our fleek deployment will be available from our ENS domain and any future required updates will be much simpler and not require a proposal.\n\n#### Specification\nThe Product or Engineering workstream leader will be delegated the authority to request updates to any ENS records, with the exception of the primary blockchain addresses. These requests will be facilitated by the DAO’s multisig signers.  As a check and balance on this authority, if the multisig signers believe the update to be malicious they are not compelled to execute the transaction and may reject the request forcing the update to then proceed through governance. \n\nAdditionally, this proposal will utilize the oSnap Module to provide the first update to our content hash. This is mainly meant to be a low risk test of the yet to be used oSnap Module.  This transaction will be included only in the final snapshot vote since the oSnap Module doesn’t understand our Ideation process. \n\n\n> Contract Interaction\nto: 0x4976fb03C32e5B8cfe2b6cCB31c09Ba78EBaBa41\nfunction: multicall()\ndata (bytes[]): 0x304e6ade8cecb61cd3c3e4925c76e05bd3cb407ae010e3c3ae528617c499346790b50b230000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000040000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000002ae501017200240801122074a0e0d9ce0aa9e7227fd7ae081d296021ea53863b8c3f6e43f2459f65868ce400000000000000000000000000000000000000000000&nbsp;\n\nThis transaction will update shapeshiftdao.eth's ENS content hash records from `ipns://k51qzi5uqu5dm8qlm1yk060voo84cm369avf7d8ky4y7o66ujajygnvqkhkudd` \nto \n`ipns://k51qzi5uqu5dj38h7ykps8c39w79rml2tnribl064ny0n43ri4gjed7y8rsw6c`\nHere is a [tenderly link to help validate the transaction](https://dashboard.tenderly.co/public/safe/safe-apps/simulator/6a73279c-eb34-4a94-a8b3-aee17ded968d)\n\n#### Benefits\n1. Delegates authority to trusted workstream leaders to modify records as needed.\n2. Allows for badly needed updates to occur to our content hash so that a more decentralized option is available to users of the application\n3. Creates a mechanism for checks and balances of this new power\n4. In an emergency situation this provides a path to a much quicker resolution than the governance process.\n\n#### Drawbacks\n1. Workstream leaders could theoretically update these records to the detriment of the DAO.",

      "title": "([Ideation] SCP 160 )Moderation Workstream Jan -Jun 2024",
      "content": "# Moderation Workstream Jan -Jun 2024\n\n# **2024 Jul-Dec Moderation Workstream Renewal**\n\n**Summary**\n\nThe Community Moderation Workstream is primarily responsible to support the community and to maintain the integrity of all ShapeShift various platforms such as Discord, The Forum, and Notion, snapshot, and any/all others. Future platforms that the community chooses to implement also to be included. This workstream is used daily to ensure the smooth operation of the ShapeShift DAO.\n\nThis proposal is to renew the Moderation Workstream, re-elect Giantkin as leader and fund the workstream through the end of Jun 2024.\n\nTotal Ask is $11600/month. (unchanged)\n\nNormal USDC monthly is $6410 (depending on Fox choice, November 2023 $6010 for example) some of which is for licenses/botspends that stay in ws treasury, and if unused per term, set aside as possible (small)bounty item, roll over to next Term (stays in Moderation subtreasury until dissolved, bountied, or too large - then revert to Treasury.\n\n### **Charter**\n\nNo other Proposals past/future are to affect this proposal.\n\nDuring the proposal run, if at any time Moderation lead needs to leave (or be asked to leave)\n\nthe Leaders group can force vote out the Moderation lead (or put leader on hold). No other method. (voluntary step down, and hand off being ideal)\n\n- Temp position given to other mod members, number 2 first would be put in ‘charge’ until lead returns, or a new lead is voted in.\n- Hiring/firing is solely based on the Moderation leads decision. Based on discussions, Total amount for proposal will be listed, without breakdown, in proposal, but in other places instead.\n\n**Abstract**\n\nModeration supports all workstreams and all users within each of the platforms it moderates. As we bring more members into the various platforms, moderators act as so much more than bot managers and spam blockers. Not only do the moderators set up the verification process, they are the point of contact for members having issues with the verification process. They function as the greeters of the DAO, if you will. Our team of moderators clears the path for new members, new contributors and new supporters by facilitating a fluid user experience. Enthusiastic about all things defi and crypto, empowering community members, new and old alike, on their journey to self-empowered entrepreneurism.\n\n**Motivation**\n\nThe mission of this workstream is simple: to help people. Moderation is the workstream you never knew you needed, but couldn’t live without. From welcoming new users to setting up  calls to managing bots. Moderation is here to support the community. This workstream strives to create a space that fosters security, growth and innovation.\n\nOur team of trustworthy, confident and enthusiastic moderators allows for decentralization of community moderation. This may address the point of preventing accusations of vested interest, since only community elected mods have the power to preserve and maintain the DAO culture.\n\nAs the workstream leader, I want to make the user feel like they are able to relax. Users are most likely talking from their home space, home usually means they feel safe. I want to keep that feeling in our group.\n\n**Specification**\n\nModerators take on wide variety of tasks, including but not limited to:\n\n- Organize user flow via roles, channels and bots\n- Create and maintain scheduled events in sesh & Discord\n- Provide protection from scammers\n- Warn abusers (strike system established by Giantkin)\n- Providing basic Discord support\n- Facilitating ‘temps’ for a job, for example, providing the DJ with a role for the event\n- Help maintain and update server images such as avatars, stickers, emojis, etc. (Emptyslot)\n- Provide security support (live when possible) for meetings and community events\n- Drive users to the proper channels\n- Continually monitoring channels, and other server banlists for potential spam/scammers and adding them into our banlist\n- Taking part in Support/Ops triage process by shuttling members requesting support to the proper channels, connecting with self help resources, #support,chatwoot, etc as appropriate\n- Appropriate use of Admin Power by Moderation Workstream Leader\n- Work with  Admins to facilitate bots/webhooks/roles/channels/categories -servers/platforms etc\n- Enforce the Current Code of Conduct to the best of ability, with positive intent.\n\n**What are the goals of this workstream?**\n\n- Provide 12 hour moderation coverage to ShapeShift DAO’s community channels, with the eventual goal to provide 24 hour coverage\n- Proactively ban 90% of scammers/bots that try to sneak into ShapeShift discord\n- Ensure that all community meetings are scheduled on the calendar\n- The Moderation Workstream is successful when you don’t notice that it’s there.\n\nDuring the Jul - Dec 2023 term, the Moderation Workstream has accomplished the following:\n\n- Sustainability updates to server roles and channels\n- Few problems known.\n- Tested, added removed tools reporting bots (boardroom vs snapshot for example)\n- Gated bot installs with higher perms than needed.\n- installed tested Galxe,zealy, and guild bot setups.\n- setup missions for all 3bots above.  galxe-giuld bot have interconnected missions (see global)\n- overwatched forum setup, and growth.\n- watched 14,000+ users in discord!\n- Added Websupport, for Support use and testing. (removed websupport for rethink)\n- Setup Discord ‘Forum’ threads for Stage Events and other meetings. (works great!)\n\n### **Other items not included but taken on**\n\n- Monthly Foxpayout for contributors: maintain and update sheet monthly. Facilitate payout for WS and other groups, as needed/requested : remind WSleaders to update contributors Choice(s), and update their tab. Work with Willy to get things done as timely as possible. -update the fox price on a set schedule/method.\n- Praise steward. push for others to use. (slow process!)\n- audio record primary meetings - office hours\n- Jump into our partners Discords to help setup a basic security process, to help protect our users there.\n\n**Benefits**\n\n- Keeps the discord clear of spammers\n- Limits the Scammers on server\n\n**Drawbacks**\n\n- Growing member list, growing expense.",

      "title": "[Ideation] SCP 159: TMDC Revisions - Fall 2023",
      "content": "**Objective:**\n\nThis proposal aims to address three critical issues within the Treasury Management and Diversification Committee (TMDC):\n\n - Replacement of @Kent with @GiantKin on the TMDC.\n - Decrease the quorum requirements for votes from 4 to 3.\n - Eliminate TMDC compensation for @ProfMcCarthy if/when his new role as Tokenomics Workstream leader is approved.\n\n**Summary:**\nThe proposed changes to the TMDC are as follows:\n\n1. **Membership Change:** To maintain a five-member TMDC, we propose adding @GiantKin, who had previously been considered in SCP 148 and is willing to serve. Notably, @FireB0mb1, another DAO member interested in joining the TMDC, has withdrawn his application and interest.\n\n2. **Quorum Requirement Adjustment:** This proposal recommends reducing the quorum requirements for TMDC votes from the current 4 to 3. This adjustment aims to expedite decision-making within the TMDC.\n\n3. **Eliminate TMDC Compensation for @ProfMcCarthy:** The proposal suggests discontinuing compensation for @ProfMcCarthy if he is confirmed as the Tokenomics Workstream Leader.\n\n**Background:**\nThe TMDC was initially established on a trial basis in SCP-36 in November 2021 and subsequently continued indefinitely by SCP-62 in February 2022. SCP 148 also oversaw the transfer of roles within the TMDC, as well as clarified its purview.\n\nUnder SCP 148, TMDC compensation was increased to 1,250 USD worth of FOX per month for each committee member, except for Kent, who did not accept compensation due to his role as tokenomics workstream leader.\n\nIf this proposal is approved, @GiantKin, as the fifth TMDC member, will also be compensated with 1,250 USD worth of FOX per month.\n\nThe reduction in quorum requirements from 4 to 3 is necessary to streamline TMDC decision-making, as achieving a quorum of 4 with only 4 members has proven challenging and has led to delays in critical matters, such as managing stablecoin holdings for payroll.\n\nFurthermore, if ProfMcCarthy's proposal to continue as the tokenomics workstream leader is accepted, this proposal will have a net-zero impact on FOX or stablecoin holdings. The decrease in 1,250 USD worth of FOX from ProfMccarthy no longer accepting compensation for their TMDC role will exactly offset the compensation to be given to @GiantKin for his role.\n\n**Motivation:**\nWith @Kent resigning from the committee, ensuring that the TMDC maintains adequate staffing is imperative. Reducing the quorum requirement will expedite decision-making, aligning with the TMDC's goal of providing timely recommendations for stablecoins, debt management, and asset diversification. Additionally, it is essential to clarify that, as the tokenomics workstream leader, @ProfMccarthy will no longer receive compensation for their role on the TMDC.\n\n**Benefits:**\nPassing this proposal will yield several advantages:\n\n1. Ensures the TMDC maintains five voting members by welcoming @GiantKin as the fifth member.\n2. Facilitates quicker decision-making by reducing the quorum requirements to 3.\n3. Eliminates FOX compensation for @ProfMcCarthy effective when they start their role as tokenomics workstream leader.\n\n**Drawbacks:**\nThere are no drawbacks to this proposal beyond those inherent to the TMDC itself.",

This is mainly meant to be a low risk test of the yet to be used oSnap Module.  This transaction will be included only in the final snapshot vote since the oSnap Module doesn’t understand our Ideation process. \n\n\n> Contract Interaction\nto: 0x4976fb03C32e5B8cfe2b6cCB31c09Ba78EBaBa41\nfunction: multicall()\ndata (bytes[]): 0x304e6ade8cecb61cd3c3e4925c76e05bd3cb407ae010e3c3ae528617c499346790b50b230000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000040000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000002ae501017200240801122074a0e0d9ce0aa9e7227fd7ae081d296021ea53863b8c3f6e43f2459f65868ce400000000000000000000000000000000000000000000&nbsp;\n\nThis transaction will update shapeshiftdao.eth's ENS content hash records from `ipns://k51qzi5uqu5dm8qlm1yk060voo84cm369avf7d8ky4y7o66ujajygnvqkhkudd` \nto \n`ipns://k51qzi5uqu5dj38h7ykps8c39w79rml2tnribl064ny0n43ri4gjed7y8rsw6c`\nHere is a [tenderly link to help validate the transaction](https://dashboard.tenderly.co/public/safe/safe-apps/simulator/6a73279c-eb34-4a94-a8b3-aee17ded968d)\n\n#### Benefits\n1.

      "title": "SCP157: Tokenomics Workstream Leader Continuity Proposal",
      "content": "**Summary**:\n\nThis proposal seeks community approval for the replacement of the TMDC & tokenomics workstream lead for the period of 3 months (retroactive to 11.01.23 and ending 01.31.24). This proposal includes a re-envisioning of core responsibilities and their cadence, and includes a ramp-up of the allocation of FOX compensation, to ProfMcCarthy, who will undertake the pivotal role of Tokenomics Workstream Leader. The compensation will ramp up, starting at $7,000 per month for the first month, $10,000 per month for the second month, and $14,000 for the last month of (3-month) locked fox compensation. This is in alignment with the standard compensation granted to workstream leaders and has no impact on our stablecoin holdings or runway since compensation will be entirely in FOX. The Tokenomics Workstream Leader will oversee the management and revitalization of the ShapeShift DAO tokenomics and publish Shapeshift DAO external-facing reports.\n\n**Abstract**:\n\nAs we embark on a reimagined approach within our Tokenomics Workstream, I am enthusiastic and motivated by the significant opportunity before us. This opportunity not only presents the means to address the pressing challenges currently confronting the ShapeShift DAO but also affords us the ability to meticulously navigate a new path for the governance of tokenomics. In essence, this proposal represents a reimagination of the tokenomics workstream, one that acknowledges the ever-evolving dynamics inherent to our ecosystem. In this new landscape, I recognize the immediate relevance of the proposed fee model, which introduces a sophisticated parametric fee structure for all trade routes. In my capacity as the Tokenomics Head, a role of pivotal importance within this reconfigured workstream, I am genuinely excited to undertake novel responsibilities and imagine new ones. My goal is to provide the utmost value to FOX holders and expand coverage of revenue streams.\n\n**Motivation**:\n\nThe motivation behind this proposal is to formalize the continuation of the Tokenomics Workstream under the leadership of ProfMcCarthy, who will lead the revitalization of our tokenomics. ProfMcCarthy is an Associate Professor of Economics at a state college in the US. They have a PhD in Economics from Colorado State University, with specializations in monetary economics and political economy. ProfMcCarthy also serves as the director for the local small business development center. ProfMcCarthy has experience in managing the DAO’s treasury, as they have been on the TMDC since its inception in October, 2021. This transition is imperative to address the evolving dynamics of our ecosystem and align our tokenomics with the community's interests. Recent (and past) unforced errors show the need for greater guidance and ownership of the processes within recommended policies regarding payments, investing, and managing risk.\n\n**Specification**:\n\nThe Tokenomics Workstream Leader, ProfMcCarthy, will undertake various tasks including: \n\n - Produce at least two comprehensive risk management reports each month to support TMDC decisions, with the first report finalized and published no later than 11/15/23.\n\n - Steward decisions regarding loans and/or bonds alongside the TMDC (as needed)\n\n - Submit monthly expenditure reports by the 5th of each subsequent month.\n\n - Submit monthly revenue reports by the 5th of each subsequent month\n\n - Report on stablecoin holdings weekly starting week of 11/13/23.\n\n - Report on runway weekly beginning week of 11/13/23.\n\n - Conduct market opportunity research and publish reports on yield trends within SS, new tokens/chains, existing tokens/chains with changes (bimonthly with first two reports published 11/30/23 and each subsequent report published on the 15th and 30th)\n\n - Preparing professional external-facing reports (similar to that of Gnosis Karpatkey Treasury reports and BadgerDAO’s “State of the DAO” reports) (Monthly by the 20th)\n\n - Ensuring that the DAO’s information is available and accurate in leading financial and crypto information spaces (such as www.tokenterminal.com) (add 5 financial sources by 01/31/24)\n\n - Perform monthly sentiment analysis and publish reports (on the 30th)\n\n - Perform an initial assessment of the tokenomics structure (by 12/15/23)\n\n - Work alongside other workstream leaders and the TMDC to draft and revise fee model parameters.\n\n - Attend governance and ops sprint meetings weekly.\n\n - Engage in community forums nearly daily with measured impact by tracking engagement metrics monthly.\n\n - Complete post-mortem reports and rectification strategies on an ad-hoc basis.\n \n- Recruit new members to the DAO.\n\n - Strengthening the protections for FOX holders \n\n - Expanding coverage of revenue streams\n\n - DAO-to-DAO liasing\n\n - Working closely with marketing to issue reports\n\n - Periodic reviews to gather community feedback (surveys/discord discussions)\n\nThese starting tasks are aimed at ensuring our tokenomics remain competitive, sustainable, and transparent. Additionally, the Tokenomics Workstream Leader will play a crucial role in assessing the impact of the proposed fee model on our tokenomics, fine-tuning the fee model parameters, gathering feedback, providing data-driven insights, ensuring integration with governance, and staying up-to-date with market trends and competitor fee models. Additionally, alongside TMDC, the workstream will focus on stewarding the FOX foundation loan and keep a keen eye on the DAO’s token revenues, stable revenues, and outstanding liabilities with rigor and transparency. \n\nProfMcCarthy would hold office hours, present at tokenomics meetings, recruit new members to the DAO and the tokenomics workstream and the TMDC, and make themselves available async within hours should any community member have need of them, day or night, seven days a week. ProfMcCarthy will monitor fox price and activity, setting alerts and watching sentiment analysis predictors to foresee and mitigate risk events. \n\nProfMcCarthy would keep his role on the TMDC but forgo compensation previously allocated to him for the TMDC role.\n\n**Benefits**:\n\n1. Leadership Continuity: Supporting this proposal ensures the continuity of leadership within the Tokenomics Workstream, allowing for a seamless transition and execution of the fee model proposal, revenue predictions, and risk-focused management of the TMDC assets.\n\n2. Expert Oversight: ProfMcCarthy, as the Tokenomics Workstream Leader, will bring expertise to the management of our tokenomics, facilitating sound decision-making and strategic planning.\n\n3. Enhanced Community Engagement: ProfMcCarthy's role includes active community engagement and feedback gathering, fostering a stronger alignment between our tokenomics and the community's interests.\n\n4. Additional Support for the Evolving Dynamic Parametric Fee Structure: The Tokenomics Workstream Leader will provide valuable support and insights into the implementation and management of the dynamic parametric fee structure, ensuring its effectiveness.\n\n**Drawbacks**:\n\n1. Allocation of FOX tokens for this role means resources that could be preserved and allocated for alternative purposes are utilized.\n\n2. Tokenomics, as a relatively new discipline, carries inherent risks. Analyzed hypotheses and risk mitigation strategies may not prove accurate over time, potentially leading to unforeseen consequences.\n\n**Vote**:\n\n- **For**: Supporting this proposal signifies approval for the continuation of the Tokenomics Workstream, with ProfMcCarthy as the new workstream leader, and the allocation of compensation in the form of $31,000 over a 3-month period, entirely in FOX.\n\n- **Against**: Rejecting this proposal indicates disapproval of the Tokenomics Workstream's continuation under the leadership of ProfMcCarthy and the compensation allocation.\n\nPlease cast your vote as \"For\" or \"Against\" to express your stance on this proposal.\n\n[Vote Here: For / Against]",

      "content": "Summary\n\n\nThis proposal seeks to remove the mandated step of Incubation from our governance process in order to simplify the confusion with naming conventions and the process by which our community can enact changes in the DAO.\n\n\n\nAbstract\n\n\nCurrently our governance process consists of 3 steps that are required to pass a new proposal: Incubation, Ideation, and a final Snapshot vote. While Incubation can be useful to gather community input, it essentially acts as a “Request for Comment” phase and should not be a strict requirement if a proposal is already well formulated and ready for a more formal vote from the community. \n\n\n\nIf passed, this proposal would remove the requirement for an Incubation post and deprecate the Incubation name to reduce confusion with similarly named steps in the process.\n\n\n\nMotivation\n\n\nThe DAO is at a critical juncture in its lifecycle. The need for the community to be able to quickly and effectively make decisions is more important than ever.  Simplifying the process and removing confusion around naming conventions will help token holders navigate the process more efficiently.\n\n\n\nSpecification\n\n\nIncubation will become an optional step in our governance process. \nThe name Incubation will no longer be used and instead suggest tagging forum posts of this nature with [RFC] (request for comment). \nThe minimum final vote time will be modified from 3 days to 5 days\nThe minimum time for ideation will be modified from 5 days to 7 days\nThis change will reduce the increase possible timeline for a proposal to be passed through to 12 days from 11 days\n\n\nBenefits\n\n\nSimpler Process\nClearer naming convention\n\n\nDrawbacks\n\n\nChanging the governance process involves some time period for the community to adjust to the new process.\nIn theory, some proposal ideas may have never made it past an Incubation post, but based on the history of the DAO this has not been the case. Additionally there was never anything stopping someone from moving a proposal to Ideation even if there was strong dissent during Incubation.",

      "content": "Summary\n\n\nThis proposal seeks to move our governance discussions and community forum back to Discourse (a reversal of SCP-101) due to the continued production issues and poor user experience with Metaforo. \n\n\n\nAbstract\n\n\nIf approved, this proposal will enact two major changes: 1) The official forum platform of the Shapeshift DAO will be migrated back to Discourse and 2) due to the lack of support for FOX weighted voting Ideation votes will occur on Snapshot per the specification outlined in SCP-97\n\n\n\nMotivation\n\n\nMetaforo’s platform has been a constant source of governance user complaints since adoption in SCP-101. Support requests from our Moderation workstream have gone unanswered \n\n\n\nhttps://www.metaforo.io/g/MetaforoOfficialDiscussionGroup/thread/polls-45108\nhttps://www.metaforo.io/g/MetaforoOfficialDiscussionGroup/thread/moderation-2-42088\nhttps://www.metaforo.io/g/MetaforoOfficialDiscussionGroup/thread/odd-spot-when-banning-spammer-45106 \nhttps://www.metaforo.io/g/MetaforoOfficialDiscussionGroup/thread/quote-issues-reply-42072\n\n\nfor more than 3 months. Mobile browser issues, such as links not working, were reported to the team on Jan 3rd 2023 and are still presently an issue seven months later as of September 8th 2023.\n\n\n\nBasic forum functionality, like the ability to quote a user, still isn’t available and currently the state of the text editor is unusable, with most contributors choosing to draft text in a separate application prior to pasting the information into Metaforo.\n\n\n\nShapeshift Governance passed SCP-101 in September of 2022, and the metaforo team has had an ample opportunity to retain us as users. \n\n\n\nIf passed, I will act as owner of the migration efforts to coordinate the move back to Discourse. There are some unknowns at the moment around our ability to export data from Metaforo into Discourse, but I believe we can work through them in parallel with getting this proposal kicked off. A minimum acceptable outcome would be an archive of all metaforo based discussions that is publicly available.\n\n\n\nThe DAO is facing a critical juncture in its existence and spending additional time struggling with basic communication on governance issues is a distraction that our community can easily remedy. \n\n\n\nSpecification\n\n\nThis proposal would kick off the following actions\n\n\n\nA migration of our official forum platform to Discourse.

If passed this proposal would explicitly delegate the authority to handle the technical aspects of the migration to me acting on behalf of the Fox Foundation.

      "content": "Engineering Workstream Renewal, Oct '23 - Mar '24\n\n\n# Abstract / Overview\n\n\n\nThis proposal adopts [SCP-92 Definition of Workstream Leader](https://snapshot.org/#/shapeshiftdao.eth/proposal/0x3529a9ab550387d1eedf34d0ba26b5c80ed1c04a74a3c407d9b06a6ea90325ab).\n\nThis proposal is to continue to fund the Engineering Workstream's budget from October 1st, 2023 through March 31th, 2024 inclusive (6 months).\n\nThe ShapeShift DAO relies on the Engineering Workstream to maintain the code base, undertake core engineering work to enable new features, and to provide architectural oversight and technical leadership as we continue to execute the roadmap as defined by the Product Workstream.\n\n# Motivation\n\n## Previous proposal\n\nThe Engineering workstream came in under budget of the previously approved proposal.\n\n* June $90,667 (included humblehound)\n\n* July $75,667\n\n* August $82,567 (included $6900 QR bug reimbursement)\n\n* September $75,667\n\nTotal labor and contingency spend of $324,567 USDC against an approved [$417,633](https://snapshot.org/#/shapeshiftdao.eth/proposal/0xdbd3051cd544def2e73c052596a44e66c519e9f8b94b827afeef385e1bd5d892)\n\n## Completed deliverables\n\n* Gnosis chain support including swapping\n\n* Foxatars project and support of mercle team\n\n* FOX Missions page\n\n* NFT support via OpenSea and Zapper\n\n* Gas estimation revamp\n\n* Full rearchitecture of swapper including multi hop trade support\n\n* THORChain Streaming Swaps\n\n* Trade time estimates\n\n* Fiat ramp updates and maintenance\n\n* Coinbase wallet\n\n* Chatwoot support widget\n\n* Mobile app update\n\n* Clear cache function for support\n\n* Charka UI major version upgrade\n\n* Yat project completion\n\n* Manual/advanced trade slippage support\n\n* Major using facing performance improvements across all platforms, including render and network\n\n* Add trade price impact warnings\n\n* Add time estimate to trades\n\n* FOX Farming V7\n\n* Various Mixpanel data reporting\n\n* Trade route analysis to negotiate vendor pricing\n\n* Backend infrastructure dashboard at monitoring.shapeshift.com\n\n* Specification, architecture and implementation of exchange.shapeshift.com first milestone\n\n* WalletConnect V2 as a dapp (ongoing)\n\n## Team\n\n* [0xdef1cafe](https://github.com/0xdef1cafe) - Workstream Leader & Senior Engineer\n\n* [0xApotheosis](https://github.com/0xApotheosis) - Senior Engineer\n\n* [gomes](https://github.com/gomesalexandre) - Senior Engineer\n\n* [kaladinlight](https://github.com/kaladinlight) - Senior Engineer\n\n* [woodenfurniture](https://github.com/woodenfurniture) - Senior Engineer\n\n## Mandate\n\nThis proposal seeks to have the Engineering Workstream be the sole maintainers with discretion over CODEOWNERS, permissions and administrative rights of the ShapeShift GitHub namespace. The billing account shall be controlled by the Fox Foundation.\n\nThis is to ensure the DAO maintains a high standard of code quality, velocity, reduced regressions, and has a single core team acting as maintainers responsible for the codebase.\n\nThe Engineering Workstream will work with external contributors to ensure contributions can be made expeditiously while not compromising quality, patterns or stability.\n\n## Budget spreadsheet\n\nThe details below expand upon the [budget spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lS0dA32rYdEpKnxOGKhSqs3ba7ffHtgX-nIKdvEDJIM)\n\n## Recurring costs\n\n### Labor\n\n* Any contributor reserves the right to take any portion of salary in FOX and locked varieties thereof.\n\n### Infrastructure\n\nThe Fox Foundation covers the costs for infrastructure that powers the entire backend of the open source platform and mobile app, and the Engineering Workstream is not requesting funds to cover these costs in this proposal. \n\n## Non-recurring costs\n\n### Miscellaneous\n\nThe budget contains a line item for $5,000 USDC of discretionary funds which may be used for travel, conferences, retreats etc, at engineering's discretion.\n\nThe line item above is provisional, and any unspent funds will be returned to the DAO.\n\nThis budget seeks approval for the commitment of $5,000 USDC for non-recurring costs.\n\n### Contingency\n\nUnforeseen costs will arise, and 10% of the USDC subtotal is requested accordingly.\n\nThe budget seeks approval for $47,700 for contingency to be spent judiciously at the workstream's discretion, shall it be required.\n\n### Variance\n\nUnused funds from any budget category will be returned to the DAO at the end of the budget cycle.\n\nIn the event that the Engineering Workstream requires more funds, a separate governance proposal shall be raised.\n\n# Deliverables\n\n## Goals\n\nThe Engineering Workstream continues on from the previously approved proposal(s).\n\nThe Engineering Workstream is the \"how\", rather than the \"what\". The Product Workstream has the mandate of \"what\" is to be built, the Engineering Workstream has the mandate of the \"how\" it is built.\n\nThe workstream exists to execute on Product Workstream's roadmap.\n\n## Reporting\n\nThe Engineering Workstream will report progress against these goals via the following methods\n\n* availability via Discord, covering most time zones\n\n* weekly product/engineering public meetings\n\n* weekly governance calls\n\n* on demand for any specific deliverable\n\nShould the community request other reasonable forms of reporting they will be considered on their merits.\n\n## Benefits\n\nThe DAO delivers a product to increase ease of use of the multi-chain multi-wallet multi-protocol universe that we find ourselves in. It is the Engineering effort that builds our product. We need Engineering in order to thrive.\n\n## Drawbacks\n\nEngineering labor is the most expensive component of the DAO's budget. Any aspect that does not seem appropriate to serve the greater needs of the DAO should be criticized.",

      "title": "SCP-152: Extend ShapeShift DAO with EIP-4824",
      "content": "Posting on behalf of amanwithwings (Aman, DAOstar)\n\nSummary\n\nThis proposal, if passed, will set ShapeShift DAO up for adopting EIP-4824, a metadata standard for DAOs. Adopting EIP-4824 involves deploying a registration contract to hold the DAO's daoURI. NO changes to ShapeShift protocol's governance or existing smart contracts, NO transfer of funds are involved with this proposal. \n\nThe EIP-4824 standard has already been embraced by the likes of Snapshot, Aragon, Optimism, etc.\n\nAbstract\n\nThe EIP-4824 standard defines common interfaces for DAOs via daoURI, akin to tokenURI for NFTs. This proposal will extend ShapeShift DAO to EIP-4824 by deploying a new registration contract through a contract interaction with the EIP-4824 factory maintained by DAOstar.\n\n\nMotivation\n\nThe absence of a global DAO interface has held back the ecosystem for a long time. New DAOs, DAO frameworks have zero visibility on aggregators, most tooling providers have a hard time integrating with different DAO architectures, there is no comprehensive, self-maintaining registry for DAO data, etc. EIP-4824 aims to solve these issues by providing a method for DAOs to self-publish information irrespective of their architecture or the chain they exist on.\n\nAdopting EIP-4824 will enrich the on-chain information availability of ShapeShift DAO's governance contracts, making it easier for existing and future DAO tools to seamlessly interact with the contracts. A specific example is enabling members to interact with the governance contracts through different front-end interfaces, potentially across multiple chains. Some of the tools that are digesting or committed to digesting this enriched information include Snapshot, Tally, Etherscan, DeepDAO, and other members of DAOstar One.\n\n- EIP-4824 has gained traction with industry leaders such as Snapshot (in Snapshot X), Aragon V3, Moloch V3, DAODAO, and Aave.\n- We are proud to announce that we recently secured a $100k grant from Optimism to promote EIP-4824 adoption among DAOs.\n- Importantly, adopting this standard does not necessitate any fund transfers from ShapeShift or alterations to its current smart contracts. It simply involves deploying a registration contract to store ShapeShift's daoURI. \n\nDAOstar (https://daostar.org/) is a non-profit that builds standards and public infrastructure for DAOs. We are supported by the Ethereum Foundation, Gnosis, Optimism Collective, The Graph, Aragon and other members of DAOstar One (https://daostar.one/). Both Snapshot and Boardroom, that ShapeShift DAO uses in its governance, along with 80+ key organizations in the DAO ecosystem, are active members of the DAOstar One Roundtable.\n\nSpecification\n\nThe EIP-4824 registration factory is located at 0x37df3fc47c1c3a2acafd2dad9c1c00090a8655bc. If this proposal passes, to upgrade to EIP-4824, execute the following call to this contract:\n\n`Call EIP4824RegistrationSummoner.summonRegistration(salt, daoURI, manager, contracts, data)`\n\nNew clones are deployed to predictable addresses using the message sender and a bytes32 value combined as a salt.\n\nTransaction data\n\n`salt = 0x42`\n\n`daoURI = https://ipfs.io/ipfs/Qmd5bEUDJ7jH242qvMHCHvTLqKRr1bYz7YyE3RWrRQGxWV`\n\n`manager =  [ ]`\n`contracts = [ ]`\n`data = [ ]`\n\nBased on earlier discussions in the ShapeShift Forum and Discord, there was rough community consensus on not setting a manager while registering. Due to this, the manager address is intentionally left blank. The DAO may add a manager for maintaining its daoURI in the future, as it sees fit. <contracts>, <data> fields are for publishing extra data and they are left blank for now.  The daoURI suggested above points to both Shapeshift’s website and governance doc, providing comprehensive information about the DAO. \n\nThe daoURI suggested above is stored on IPFS. Its subURIs- membersURI & proposalsURI, are dynamic. We currently use the Snapshot API to query proposals and the Boardroom API to query for members. This data is not being stored anywhere. \n\nFor future reference, the DAO may use the *register* functionality on the DAOstar website to create a new daoURI: https://daostar.org/register. It outputs a daoURI in this format: `https://api.daostar.org/immutable/<CID>`, in which `<CID>` is the IPFS CID of the daoURI. \n\n\nBenefits\n\nAdopting EIP-4824 would greatly improve discoverability and interoperability for Shapeshift DAO. For example, consider the DAO's multisig. Etherscan currently would not be displaying any info about the DAO which owns that multisig. Using EIP-4824, an indexor like Etherscan would be able to access ShapeShift DAO's metadata and enrich its profile. After speaking with countless DAO tooling providers, many of whom are DAOstar members (there are 50+ DAO Tooling providers in the DAOstar Round Table), the existence of such a standard would greatly improve the ecosystem.\n\nAccess to infrastructure that is being built on top EIP-4824. For example, Gitcoin is building a grant management standard; Karma, Tally, Uniswap, etc. are building an on-chain delegate registry, etc. Adopting the standard would mean access to all these important pieces of infrastructure and more that'll come up.\n\nDrawbacks\n\nGas costs required to call the registration factory.\n\nVoting\n\nFor: adopt EIP-4824\n\nAgainst: do not adopt EIP-4824",

      "title": "IDEATION [SCP-152] Parametric Survival - A Pragmatic Fee Model ",
      "content": "SCP-152 - Parametric Survival - A Pragmatic Fee Model \n\nSummary \n\nThis proposal directly supersedes SCP-128.\n\nThis proposal outlines a parametric fee model to be implemented on all trades routes. \n\nFOX holders receive discounted, up to free trades, based on a parameter.\n\nSmall trades under a given parameter qualify for free trades.\n\nA parametric curve determines discounted fees as a function of size. \n\nParameters will initially be determined by governance via this proposal. \n\nThey will be maintained by TMDC in the interim and implemented by product and engineering. \n\nUltimately be maintained via governance and enacted via SnapShot, with the results attached as data to the proposal and stored on chain. This is consistent with mature DAO best practices, inspired by lending protocols like Aave, or AMM’s like Curve.\nAbstract\n\nThis proposal introduces a three-fold change to our DAO's fee structure.\n\nFirst, we eliminate fees for small trades. \n\nSecond, we dramatically reduce fees for high-volume trades, targeting large traders while maintaining some value capture. \n\nLastly, we propose linearly-discounted trades for FOX token holders, with 1,000,000 FOX giving a 100% discount, or free trades. This encourages longer-term holding of our native token, while simultaneously offering direct utility and value to our community. \n\nMotivation\n\nShapeShift is not profitable. We are burning ~$200k in stablecoin runway each month, more if subsidized infrastructure via the Fox Foundation is included.  We need to promptly course correct from our current default-dead business model and it should be in governance’s hands to determine that future\n\nShapeShift tried a “many revenue streams” approach. These are often characterized as great or diverse. Unfortunately, they all have either become defunct, have failed to deliver, or take so long to convert that the DAO can’t meet its obligations. Or worse, they deliver tokens that are held back from conversion into our main liability assets. While it makes logical sense to have diverse revenue, without proper ownership they don’t convert in any meaningful timeline. \n\nMonetizing trade volume via fees is the de facto standard way for similar organizations or competitions within the ecosystem to generate revenue. \n\nomgitsjustfees-alwayshasbeen.jpg\n\nThere exists ambiguity in governance and the community around recently implemented fees via monetization experiments with good arguments on both sides of an old debate. \n\nSeveral proposals exist to indirectly address the debate around fees with varied approaches and subtexts. \n\nThis proposal seeks an amenable, unambiguous and clear compromise on multiple positions in a concrete way, meeting the following criteria:\nFree trades for small amounts under a specified parameter\nFree, or discounted trades for FOX holders based on holdings\nFees that decrease as a function of trade size, starting at a maximum parameter, decaying to a minimum parameter, with curve parameters.\n\nA data-driven, unambiguous, governance-approved, and parametric fee model with clear invalidation criteria plus tunability is necessary to ensure robust trade driven revenue, and hence sustainability and survival for the DAO.\n\nSpecification\n\nThe model and its parameters shall apply to all current and future trade routes or features that include a buy and sell asset(s).\n\nIt is useful to consider the parameters and their interactions in parts.\n\nSuccess and failure criteria\n\nIf over the 3 month trial period, 1 month trailing trade volume dips below 50% of the last 3 months average trade volume we will consider this a failure and revert back to no fees.\n\nOutsized trade volume that was incentivized by Optimism token rewards shall be excluded from historical data, and the underlying trade volume considered.\nFree trades for small traders\nProblem: Small traders are fickle, transient, create an outsized support burden, yet are often vocal supporters of a good product. Although they are difficult to serve, they can become one of our strongest assets for the community.\n\nSmall traders are also difficult to monetize, for example\n\nA 25bps fee on a $1,000 trade equates to $2.50 in DAO revenue. \nThis would require ~80,000 transactions of $1000 per month to generate $200k in revenue.\nLarge numbers of small users is difficult for support, operations and moderation; we reached a peak of ~50,000 MAU with ~$300,000 of OP token incentives\n\nSolution - let small trades be free, up to a specified parameter. We propose the following parameter\n\nno_fee_threshold_usd\nDenominated in USD at market price of sell asset\nPrice oracles are not of concern; downside risk is limited to a lost fee.\nSet to $1000 initially.\n\nA small trader given a good experience can become a loyal supporter. We let the krill go free.\nFree trades for FOX holders\n\nProblem: Currently the FOX token has no economic utility outside governance participation, sadly the space still finds governance underrated as a use case.\n\nSolution: This proposal gives the token utility by linearly discounting trade fees to zero for FOX holders. This is a necessary but insufficient step towards a FOX rewards program, which is yet to be specified.\n\nThe parameter should be designed with the consideration of the LTV of the user in terms of revenue foregone if fees were mandatory, assuming demand is purely inelastic. This is not precisely true, but a good linearization determines a starting point.\n\nA reasonable economic burden to the buyer, but still creating a monetary incentive to buy, hold, and participate.\n\nFor the purpose of analysis, let’s consider the current market, and the persona “rational actor”\na FOX price of $0.02, with\nA user executing a $10,000 trade,\n30bps fees\n\nSaid trade brings the DAO $30 in revenue. The persona of a user executing $10,000 in current market conditions is one of a regularly active participant. Assume they execute one transaction per month for 12 months, paying $360 in fees - their lifetime value, or LTV.\n\nThe following extreme examples would not fit their use case:\n\n100 FOX, or $2. A rational actor would buy $2 worth of FOX to offset a $30 fee on a single trade. Clearly, this is easily exploitable and harmful to DAO revenue.\n1,000,000 FOX, or $20,000. A rational actor is unlikely to allocate $20,000 of capital to offset $360 of trades in a year. \n\nThere exists a balance we must strike to capture value between easily foregone revenue and an unattractive proposition to users.\n\nAs such, we propose the following parameter \n\nfox_max_discount_threshold\nDenominated in FOX\nHolding 0 FOX will not apply any fee discount\nHolding this value of FOX or more will discount fees by 100%\nA linear discount is applied between, e.g. 250,000 FOX will apply a 25% discount to the fees that are otherwise calculated based on trade size.\nSet to an initial value of 1,000,000 FOX,or $20,000 given the price used above.\nDetermined via the same mechanism as governance, i.e. SnapShot algorithm. This captures the market participants including liquidity providers, farmers, multiple chains etc.\n\nBear in mind, the cost of acquiring the minimum FOX required is not an expense to the user, rather a capital allocation. They are not worse off - they have allocated capital to a liquid asset that can later be disposed of, and market participants may speculate on price and are exposed to volatility in both directions.\n\nThis could also be denominated in a USD value, with a utility appropriate to market conditions, say $2,000, and computed using a suitable price oracle such as Chainlink, however this adds additional lift and can be considered in a future proposal.\n\n\nWe support the FOX holding community.\n\nFee discount curve\nBusinesses operating at scale can afford to operate on lower margins, referred to as volume discounts.\n\nFees charged to a user should be proportional to the utility of the service that is provided to them. \nConsider a flat 25 bps fee on various trade sizes \n\nA user executing a $1000 trade doesn’t need a $2.50 fee to worry about.\nA user executing a $10,000 trade on a slick and reliable UI will gladly pay $25 for the service of doing so. We’ve heard this direct feedback from users actually doing these trades “don’t clutter my UI with options, just make the execution good. I’ll gladly pay since I already do everywhere else.”\nA user executing a $1,000,000 trade on the same UI will likely find a $2,500 fee steep, and are savvy enough to seek optimal trade routes elsewhere.\n\nWe propose a sigmoid curve-based decaying fee structure. This model allows for flexibility and value capture across various trade sizes.\n\nSee the Python implementation below, which is easily understood.\n\nFirst, we can calculate the fee according to the sigmoid curve. A second dimension to the fee calculation is the FOX held which creates the FOX discount percentage. This discount percentage is applied to the sigmoid curve to get the final fee to be charged. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Parameters\nFOX Max Discount Threshold (FOX)\nHolding this amount of FOX gives a 100% fee discount\nHolding a fraction of this FOX gives the same fraction of 100% as a discount.\nNo-Fee Threshold (USD)\nTransactions below this threshold incur zero fees.\nInitial value: $1,000\nMax Fee (bps)\nThe highest possible fee rate, applying immediately after surpassing the No-Fee Threshold.\nInitial value: 29 basis points\nPsychologically lower than 30bps, easy sell.\nMin Fee (bps)\nThe fee asymptotically approaches this value as trade size goes to infinity.\nInitial value: 10 basis points\nLong tail value capture on large trades.\nCurve Midpoint (USD)\nThis parameter sets the inflection point of the sigmoid curve.\nInitial value: $150,000\nThis “moves” the curve left and right.\nCurve Steepness Factor (k)\nControls the \"sharpness\" of the sigmoid curve.\nA higher value leads to a more gradual transition; a lower value leads to a sharper transition.\nInitial value: 40,000\nThis value is unitless and arbitrary.\nModel Features\nUtilizes a sigmoid function to define the fee curve.\nAllows for easy adjustments via key parameters.\nDesigned to capture maximum value in the range where the majority of trades occur.\nBenefits\nAccommodates both small and large traders.\nEnables optimal value capture on the most frequent trade sizes.\nKey parameters are under DAO governance, allowing future adjustments\nGives FOX holders another utility\n\n\n\nModel implementation\n\nAn interactive Google Colaboratory notebook is available here to be forked https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1DloLZDsy4-atEzFOlMixzdPlprFyjHik\nPython implementation\n# parameters governance votes on\nfox_max_discount_threshold = 1_000_000  # Maximum FOX held for 100% discount\nno_fee_threshold_usd = 1_000 # USD\nmax_fee_bps = 29 # bps - what fees start at\nmin_fee_bps = 10 # bps - what fees go down to, if you don't hold any FOX\nmidpoint_usd = 150_000 # USD - the \"knee\" of the fee curve\nsteepness = 40_000 # unitless - the steepness of the fee curve\n\n# implementation of the proposal you are voting on\ndef calculate_fee_bps(trade_amount_usd, fox_held, no_fee_threshold_usd, max_fee_bps, min_fee_bps, midpoint_usd, steepness):\n    # fee free amount\n    if trade_amount_usd <= no_fee_threshold_usd:\n        return 0\n    # decreasing fee based on trade amount\t\n    sigmoid_fee = min_fee_bps + (max_fee_bps - min_fee_bps) / (1 + np.exp(1 / steepness * (trade_amount_usd - midpoint_usd)))\n    # apply the discount based on FOX held\n    fox_discount = fox_held / fox_max_discount_threshold\n    fee_bps = sigmoid_fee * (1 - fox_discount)\n    return max(fee_bps, 0)\nVisualization\nA visualization is provided for illustrative and grokking purposes. The parameters and function above shall be the canonical reference and implementation, and form the core of this proposal.\n\nBenefits\nThis proposal is quantitative and focuses the discussion on the mechanics and parameters of the model, rather than assertions and hope.\n\nIt is easily understood, marketable and catchy, with a consistent message, and details that can be expanded upon by referencing dynamic parameters, for example\n\n“Small trades are free at ShapeShift!”\n“We support small traders, we don’t charge fees under no_fee_threshold_usd”\n“Free trades for FOX holders at ShapeShift”\n“We support our community - hold fox_max_discount_threshold and get free trades at ShapeShift”\n“Bigger trades are cheaper at ShapeShift”\n“We welcome whales - only calculate_fee_bps(...) basis points for your $trade_amount_usd trade at ShapeShift”, or “$400 fees on a million dollar trade? $FOX yeah”\n\nAllows for data-driven feedback and experimentation with the parameters of the model to maximize revenue generation.\n\nCreates a value accrual mechanism for the ShapeShift token outside governance participation.\n\nDirectly addresses multiple outstanding proposals trying to indirectly address this core issue in underhanded ways.\n\nUsers can choose to opt-out of fees by buying FOX, creating buy pressure.\n\nCreates a liquid revenue stream across a variety of trade routes that can be promptly converted into stablecoins at the TMDC’s discretion to extend our runway and ensure survival.\n\nDrawbacks\n\nThis may impact grant funding at Optimism but TBD on other grant partnerships.\n\nThis may mean we are not classed as a free public good, worth noting we are still majority open source.\n\nThe delegation of responsibility to the TMDC is acceptable but not maximal decentralization. \n\nEnsuring a balance of rapidly responding to price volatility and market feedback, vs. the cumbersome nature of a governance vote enacting simple parameter changes will be difficult to explicitly define, refine, and iterate on.\n\nThe system may be open to abuse in unforeseen ways, leading to market volatility.",

Align with the mission and goals of the ShapeShift DAO and other workstreams for efficient execution.\n\n## **Goals:**\n\n- Goal 1 Execute on a calculated Portfolio of bets\n- Goal 2 Retention 🔂 Revenue & User growth\n- Goal 3 Mandated Metrics & Measurement\n- Goal 4 Experiment more\n- Goal 5 Talk to our users\n- Goal 6 Assist Grants Partnerships\n\n### **Abstract -**\n\nAs a product-centric DAO, the Product Workstream is accountable for a number of activities: cross workstream alignment on execution, retaining/acquiring users, growing the FOX ecosystem, speccing/launching new product lines, and achieving Shapeshift’s mission. A YES vote for this renewal is continuing support for the strategy of a portfolio & the bets within, plus the prioritization of the current roadmap.\n\nWe’ve included a budget renewal with only three addendums: one for team software, one for an event or two, and a FOX hedgey allocation for the work stream leader. This is a minimal cost adjustment monthly, but since it's a 6 month budget may give some sticker shock.\n\n### **Specification -**\n\nNOTE: As the workstream lead I’m humbled by the amount of passion and debate for refining processes here at the DAO. If we have the bandwidth, and it is necessary, I will post a revised set of goals when we do our roadmap and strategic vision sessions. Slated for, hopefully, September —> to be deployed in October (as possibly two proposals). This solicits more feedback so that our budget is well spent and has healthy awareness & consensus. Additionally, if things reach a more dire state on the DAO’s runway by January— through market conditions or through governance actions or through unknown factors— I will likely reduce my salary first to offset costs in the DAO. This is accountability folks, at least aspiring for some.\n\nYou can find all specifications in the posts about the [Portfolio of bets under the goals post](https://forum.shapeshift.com/thread/the-portfolio-of-bets-product-goals-and-tactics-july-to-december-2023-44966) and the ratified [roadmap on snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/shapeshiftdao.eth/proposal/0xa7242bf3eb78bf5cf1bc836083475d0dfc8859996529184c8e637ca69b78eeba) and more granularly on [the spreadsheet for tracking these](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NJAT22mVg2lwVPMneE4MYjGynl_JRgPY5WnCpec6Eh0/edit#gid=0). \n\nWe track our goals at every [office hours](https://forum.shapeshift.com/edit_topic/%5B%3Chttps://www.notion.so/shapeshift/Product-Goals-Tracker-81adc3222f844c62b9b7613f6ee9308f?pvs=4%3E%5D(%3Chttps://www.notion.so/Product-Goals-Tracker-81adc3222f844c62b9b7613f6ee9308f?pvs=21%3E)) improving our documentation, rigor, and velocity. It’s worth noting that there are multiple governance proposals coming up for vote that will change the execution path of product. We’re optimistic that the holistic outcome will be beneficial for all FOX holders, our shipping velocity, the rigor of our experimentation path, and the iterations required to get us into a state of profitability.\n\n**Responsibilities**\n\n- Prioritize and adjust the roadmap with cross workstream alignment.\n- Analyzing and surfacing new revenue streams that are not listed yet in the roadmap, but reporting back to the community with more details.\n- Coordinating research and resourcing in partnership with the FOX foundation\n- Organizing and running the Monday afternoon roadmap and timeline meeting and coordinating with product and engineering throughout the week to remove blockers, assist with product related decisions and keep things moving through the feature development process and Product/Engineering status updates throughout the week.\n- Product/Engineering representation at the Weekly Ops Sprint.\n- Facilitate bi-weekly office hours to provide updates on progress, report on KPIs, and offer space to the community to ask questions, give feedback, and pitch ideas.\n- Draft product specs, review with Beard regarding designs, work with ENG workstream to evaluate engineering resources, and iterate the feature development process.\n- FBL will also spend a significant effort in defining core engagement loops & behaviors for users on Shapeshift, working backwards to activation moments to surface quick wins for development.\n    - Orthogonal to this is identifying user buckets or personas, working with marketing and other workstreams.\n- Hosting and Leading Spec kickoffs/spikes/breakdowns between Product and Engineering.\n- Spinning up regular retros (at either phase completion or large feature completeness)\n- Leading and continuing all scheduled team syncs and 1-on-1s.\n- Managing Budget and workstream contributor payments made through Colony.\n- Coordinating strategy sessions, touchpoint, and retros for launches. Facilitating where necessary.\n\n### **Budget and team**\n\nThe Product workstream will consist of 4 members. 3 full-time and 1 part-time.\n\n \n![Screen Shot 2023-08-25 at 8.02.52 PM.png](ipfs://bafkreieo5xn5panyflul34lnse45hvhsowehwh2w2hilnlbu25b3wj5jdm)\n    \n\nThe additional addendums are a modest stipend for two events & earmarked SaaS budget:\n\n- SaaS\n    - current funds: [$1248] —> continue holding funds in colony until we negotiate with zenhub or linear for annual plan.\n    - Additional earmarks: Figma [$69 a mo for the team—nice]\n- Events\n    - ETH Chicago (this is earmarked and we will be thrifty: printed API materials for PTT to bring to builders at the hackathon; success measured by leads in the API TAM breakdown sheet and their closure by EOQ)\n    - ETH Denver ( I earmarked $200 a team member for flight or stipend, up to them if they want. Also, if we don’t go, then return to DAO after the term.)\n\nI mentioned in the last post:\n\n> I'll be taking full stables for the first few months, at which point I'll propose taking a portion in time-locked FOX on our next budget renewal. Skin in the game folks.\n> \n\nI’ve proposed a modest FOX addendum for myself, 1k a month and locked as a 6 month hedgey for each disbursal. This represents an additional 6k over the term of the team, and only a 1k FOX increase spend per month and only in FOX (about $480 per month in equity to the workstream lead ). I hope my value to the DAO has been obvious so far and this is ok!\n\n### **The total budget breakdown**\n\n[The monthly September - February budget](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TcSf7aKcH239wQddVv-Gqy54nXNfI53rkUe_WE6G1JA/edit?usp=sharing) breakdown will be:\n\n$37,589.90 USDC\n\n5,980.00 FOX \n\n$43,569.90 TOTAL value\n\nTotals come out to:\n\n$225,539.40 USDC\n\n35,880.00 FOX (including $2400 in FOX for user testing, not monthly since we haven't disbursed all of this yet)\n\n**$263,819.40** TOTAL\n\n \n![Screen Shot 2023-08-25 at 8.03.20 PM.png](ipfs://bafkreiaypnsevzlrj46cpd3c5j6wau7b3cufy5bdbdc5x6va32aduyggta)\n    \n\nThis is the previous total budget:\n\n \n![Screen Shot 2023-08-25 at 8.03.35 PM.png](ipfs://bafkreifgjtk62khqg3oboomxxlmj5rr5lddr5lxvoqcquahx6sdtedzzti)\n    \n\nApple to apples in monthly cost: the change to the DAO topline is 3% per month. Comparing the cost for the 6 month original cost term versus 4 month term : 16% total increase. Primarily because of FOX for users and the workstream lead.\n\n### **Benefits -**\n\nShips the portfolio of bets, gets the next roadmap cycle iterated and into goverance, continues to build our two main focus initiatives: the API and the frontend. Unlocks new features, continues alignment with a strategic lens, and continues execution of the product team’s goals.\n\n### **Drawbacks -**\n\nWe’re moving with more rigor so we aren’t shipping as many shiny features. \n\nOur team is lean so there is only so many resources to cross allocate",

      "title": "[SCP-151] Amendment to SCP-92: Definition of a Workstream Leader",
      "content": "## Summary\nThis proposal adds two points of clarification to [SCP-92: Definition of a Workstream Leader](https://snapshot.org/#/shapeshiftdao.eth/proposal/0x3529a9ab550387d1eedf34d0ba26b5c80ed1c04a74a3c407d9b06a6ea90325ab).\n## Abstract\nIn pursuit of its mission, the ShapeShift community has delegated authority and resources to Workstream Leaders. The benefit of this framework is that it enables workstreams to move and build quickly without burdening themselves or the governance process with minutiae. The risk is that workstreams could use the powers granted to them to move in a direction that either hasn’t been approved by the community, or worse, has been explicitly disapproved. \n## Motivation\nThe motivation of this proposal is to clarify the boundaries of workstream leaders’ authority, making it clear that workstream leaders do not have the authority to override past community governance without passing a superceding proposal, nor do they have any powers not explicitly granted to them via governance.\n## Specification\nIf this proposal passes, the following sentence will be added to the Single Workstream Leader section of SCP-92: Definition of a Workstream Leader\"\n\n\"Workstream leaders do not have the ability to make decisions that have explicitly been disapproved by governance unless the disapproval was explicitly superseded in a subsequent proposal.\"\n\nTo guide any workstream leaders or community members who wish to pass a superseding proposal on any matter in the future, the following section will be added to the FOX Governance process:\n\n### Superseding Proposals\n\nIn order to supersede a past decision made by governance, the superseding proposal must explicitly state the name, the SCP#, and the portions of the proposal it supersedes.\n\nExample: \"This proposal supersedes [SCP-ABC] in its entirety.\"\nor\n\"This proposal supersedes the budget section in [SCP-XYZ] and replaces it with the following\"\n\n--\n\nIf passed, this amendment will apply to all past and future proposals until it's explicitly superseded.\n\n## Benefits\n1. Clarify the boundaries of workstream leaders’ authority\n2. Ensure that ShapeShift community governance continues to be the highest level of authority\n\n## Drawbacks\n1. If community members and/or workstream leaders change their mind about a decision, they need to pass a superseding proposal before effectuating the decision",

      "content": "## Summary\n\nThis proposal seeks two purposes in regard to the Treasury Management and Diversification Committee:\n\n1. @jonisjon is stepping off the committee. Assign @0xFBL as the 5th member of the committee\n1. Modify the compensation of committee members from the current 4000 FOX per month to $1,250 worth of FOX per month.\n\n## Abstract\n\n1. @0xFBL garnered the most votes in the incubation post here: https://forum.shapeshift.com/thread/45397\n1. The compensation of 4000 FOX per month was requested and approved in February, 2022. This proposal would increase that compensation to $1,250 worth of FOX per month, per committee member. Note that Kent is a voting member and does not take compensation. Should FBL become a TMDC member, he will also waive his compensation for being on the committee. \n\n## Motivation\n\n1. With @Jonisjon leaving the committee, we need to maintain 5 committee members.\n1. In February 2022, when 4000 FOX was set as the compensation amount, FOX was trading around $0.29, which is more than 10x from where it is today. The following time expectation exists for committee members:\n\n- 2 30-minute TMDC meetings a week (which frequently run long)\n- 1 60-minute Tokenomics meeting per week\n- Ad-hoc time as needed for research, proposal creation, and partner discussions\n\nThis brings the total time to 8-12 hours per month. 4000 FOX is not commensurate compensation for that time commitment.\n\n## Specification\n\n1. Keep the TMDC voting member count at 5 by assigning @0xFBL to the committee.\n1. Establish a monthly payment of $1250 worth of FOX to voting members who choose to receive it.\n\n## Benefits\n\nThe passage of this proposal will ensure we have five voting members on the TMDC and will increase committee member compensation so it is commensurate with the time expectation to serve on the committee.\n\n## Drawbacks\n\nThis will come at a cost to the DAO of $3,750 worth of FOX per month, with two of the proposed members receiving compensation from a workstream and opting to waive this committee compensation. Therefore, this compensation will only be paid out to three of the committee members.\n\n## Vote\n\nA vote \"For\" will assign @0xFBL as a voting member of the committee and establish a $1,250 in FOX monthly payment to voting members.\n\nA vote \"Against\" will make no changes, and there will only be four voting members on the committee.",

      "title": "[SCP-147] - Renewing the Operations Workstream for a Fifth Term (August 23 - January 24)",
      "content": "Summary\n\nThis proposal is for a continuation of budget funding for another 6 month term, August 1- January 31st, 2024 (Fifth Term) for the current Operations workstream that was established with passing of the previous proposals: [SCP-8], [SCP-59], [SCP-94], and [SCP-125].\n\nThis proposal seeks to resume the current team and achieve the same KPIs and goals while being open and flexible to the future requirements to support the new ShapeShift API services that have yet to be built, as well as define Customer Support KPIs once the transition to Chatwoot has been completed. Future KPIs will be drafted and assumed during the term to match the needs and requirements of the DAO’s product suite in all forms. \n\nThis proposal adopts [SCP-92] Definition of Workstream Leader\n\n\n\nAbstract\n\nThe Operations workstream is an integral part of the growth and development of healthy systems for reliably producing and maintaining the ShapeShift product suite and its uptime, responsiveness and feature functionality. The workstream additionally provides similar support and structure to the DAO, its ecosystem and networks.\n\nThrough Production Issue Procedure Best Practices, Triage Management, Deployment and Regression Testing, Customer Support and DAO Admin Procedures and Practices, the ShapeShift DAO Operations Workstream provides essential resources and tools for efficiency, organization, and overall product and services health that are vital to the success of the DAO, the product suite, it’s contributors, and $FOX token utility.\n\n\n\nMotivation\n\nRenewing this workstream will allow Operations to continue to work side by side with other workstreams to increase efficiency in individual procedural processes across the DAO and help progress deployment and testing processes while still verifying and maintaining reliability, health, and full functionality of all provided services. \n\nAreas of focus and Operations responsibilities maintained by the workstream also include: Hosting the Weekly Governance call and advocating the Governance process, Organizing and hosting the bi-monthly AllFox community call, Marketing content reviews and support, Leading and collaborating in Product specs, Expected Feature Release Testing guidelines, Go/No Gos, Retros and other coordinated meetings or DAO processes,  RDP management, Gitbook documentation management (soon to be expanded into Chatwoot Helpdesk), full coverage of customer support, and the flexibility to provide future technical support and partner relations with individual consumers of our new ShapeShift API in whatever ways the DAO requires once we build out this service. \n\nThe Operations workstream continues to focus on the wider picture of the product suite’s uptime, functionality, and overall health and user support. It additionally mirrors that responsibility in the DAO Discord, Github, and Notion by synergizing and coordinating cross-stream collaboration further strengthening the DAO.\n\n\n\nSpecification\n\nThe Operations workstream Notion repo can be found here.\n\n\n\nOperations maintains: \n\nTriage: Known Issues\n\n2023 Prod Issues tracking, Release Stats and testing fees, \n\nOps Sprint, Governance Call, AllFox, Go/NoGos, Retros, RDP program, ShapeShift API payment Multi-sig Controllers, Gitbook, Customer support in Discord\n\nThe Operations Workstream strives to keep the greater DAO agile and committed to maximizing efficiency, scalability, and transparency with a strategic lean into data-based decision making. At times, best practices and procedures may be challenged, modified, updated, changed, archived or revisited to maintain those objectives. (See: The Bounty Process, Trusted Community Devs, Triage Report Tracker, Unsolved User Problems, the governance tracker, POAP minting, daily regression testing, the evolution of goat/no goats, etc) \n\nThe renewal term length for this workstream and its contributors is 6 months, from August 1st 2023 to January 31st 2024.\n\nThis proposal continues @Tyler | ShapeShift as the workstream leader and @Tshifty, and @MBMaria as Operations Coordinators.\n\n\n\nBudget ask: $177,000 - 32.57% less than the previous term \n\nMonthly USDC: $23,875 - 26.37% reduction from $32,425.00 last term.\n\nMonthly FOX: $5,625.00 - 50.33% reduction from $11,325.00 last term.\n\nMonthly total budget: $29,500.00 - 32.57% reduction from $43,750.00 last term.\n\n6 month USDC budget: $143,250.00\n\n6 month FOX budget: $33,750.00\n\n6 month Total budget: $177,000.00\n\nFull budget details\n\n\n\nThe budget has been reduced across the board in both $FOX and $USDC monthly ask to continue to keep a conscious effort in extending the DAO Runway while maintaining an agile and intimate team of Operations contributors that can collaborate across time zones to provide adequate coverage for support, triage, testing, and all other outlined needs of other workstreams, the DAO, and it’s product suite. This budget has a reduced team of 3 full time contributors as opposed to the staffing room for 5 approved in the previous term.  \n\nOutside of the team size decrease, there has been a reduction in the amount of monthly test and misc funds, and notability 17% reduction in Tyler’s salary, returning his compensation to the USD value it was in [SCP-94]. With the conclusion of the temporary additional Workstream leader responsibilities in [SCP-99] and [SCP-133] Tyler’s Salary and time commitment will be reduced accordingly. \n\nOperations will continue to be mindful and agile about its processes with the DAO to continue to provide proficient coverage and support in all of the outlined areas of this proposal while maintaining our KPIs under this optimized budget. \n\nOperations would account for 12.4% of the total DAO monthly stable spend if this proposal (and the increases in [SCP-144]) were to be passed, \n\nIf network conditions or the price of FOX decreasing dramatically alters or changes Operations ability to perform required deployment and regression testing, an additional proposal addendum for test funds may be proposed. \n\n\n\n\n\nSpecific Goals and Success Metrics\n\nThe goals and success metrics for the Operations Workstream are listed below, split into current Goals and KPIs.\n\n\n\nCurrent Measurables:\n\n\n\nProduction Issue Best Practices\n\nGoals:\n\nTo minimize downtime of the entire product suite.\n\nTo resolve production environment bugs efficiently with minimal disruption to engineering processes, deployment cadences, or user experience.\n\nKPIs:\n\n99% uptime of the product suite and services: \n\nFebruary: 96.55%\n\nMarch 99.9%\n\nApril: 100%\n\nMay: 100%\n\nJune: 93.34%\n\nJuly: 100 % (so far)\n\nAverage 6 month uptime: 98.29% (97.9% last term) \n\n<8 Production Issue Escalations per Quarter - 3 Escalations in Q1, 1 Escalations in Q2 \n\n<50 Total Combined DAO Contributor hours dedicated to Production Issue Resolutions Per Quarter (Q1 - 8 hours, Q2 - 5 hours)\n\n\n\nTriage Management\n\nGoals:\n\nTo discover, isolate, navigate, and manage resolutions of user facing issues in all ShapeShift products and services.\n\nTo provide known troubleshooting and mitigation steps for issue reporters and users during the discovery and recreation of triage tickets.\n\nTo mitigate and expedite time required from core contributors spent on bug tickets, issue reports, and production level emergencies.\n\nTo transfer correctly completed and accurate Github tickets of triage bugs to Engineering or Product to be posted for bounty.\n\nKPIs:\n\nGreater than 80% resolution rate goal: 71% Resolution rate last term, 66% resolution rate previous term.  \n\n\n\nThis goal was not hit this term again overall. Operations is improving our overall resolution rate term over term and aim to be able to exceed this KPI in this proposed term with improvements and optimizations to the Triage process and ticket review/clean up practices as a new focus this term\n\n\n\nDeployment and Regression Testing\n\nGoals:\n\nTo catch 95% of prod issues during the deployment testing process.\n\nTo catch user facing issues in production environments in regression tests and #triage them accordingly.\n\nA deployment test is completed by the Operations Workstream during each release process and upon request in pre-deployment branch testing. \n\nSpecific regression tests are performed once a week by an Operations Workstream contributor to complete a full monthly regression testing schedule in accordance with regression testing best practices.\n\nOperations prioritize blocking bugs, supporting engineers, and efficiency in the processes already in place over chasing non-blocking bugs for a ‘perfected’ release.\n\nIn the 160 releases deployed since Feb 1, 2023, 3 total prod issues were experienced with only 1 of them being caused by bugs that could have been caught in the deployment testing process. 3 bugs in 160 releases = 99.98% This does not include the releases from the earlier version of testing procedures. \n\nKPIs:\n\n<2 Cadences missed per quarter due to bugs overlooked in Ops Testing (0 cadence missed last term)\n\n<2 Rollbacks during releases per quarter due to bugs overlooked in Ops Testing (0 Rollbacks occurred last term)\n\n\n\nDAO Admin Procedures and Practices \n\nGoals:\n\nTo organize successful DAO meetings related to Goat/No Goat, Retros, Ops Sprints, and AllFoxes.\n\nTo track, organize, record, and optimize DAO repos keeping them current and relevant. To help in cross workstream collaboration projects that optimize efficiency and collaborative, transparent communication. \n\nTo provide assistance in projects that require support in generating procedures to be completed for the DAO or other workstreams. \n\nKPIs: \n\nKeep All Workstream leaders and key contributors informed and involved in contributions to all Ops Sprints, Governance Calls, AllFoxes Slide decks, Go/No Gos, and Retros. \n\nThis KPI will additionally be updated for future Customer Support and ShapeShift API support and uptime KPIs and goals this term. \n\n\n\nBenefits:\n\n\n\nIf this proposal passes, the DAO will continue to fund the Operations workstream budget to meet the deliverables and services outlined which are integral to the DAO’s success and current practices. Coverage for Prod Issue escalations, Triage Management, Regularly scheduled regression and deployment testing, Customer Support, Cross workstream alignment and stakeholder resources would all be focused, maintained and improved upon by the workstream.\n\n\n\nPassing this proposal will continue uninterrupted support and services offered from the Operations workstream to the DAO.\n\n\n\nDrawbacks:\n\n\n\nFunding this workstream costs the DAO stablecoins and FOX during the duration of the proposed term. This workstream would cost the DAO treasury potentially $177,000 over 6 months ($29,500/month) if all funds are needed and exhausted in the budget costing the DAO $ from the stablecoin runway.",

      "title": "SCP-144: Marketing & Business Development Workstream (MKBD) proposal, August - Feb 2024",
      "content": "## Abstract/Summary\n\nThe ShapeShift DAO’s MKBD Workstream is vital to maintain and grow to continue driving user and client adoption, discovery, and activation while retaining the core message of ShapeShift and its product and brand. With this workstream extending a broad swathe of responsibilities, including product copywriting, comarketing & partnership management, grants, external sales, and general “traditional” marketing responsibilities\n\nThis proposal will revise the responsibilities and target KPIs of the current workstream and request funding from August 1, 2023 through February 1st, 2024. \n\nThis proposal adopts SCP-92 Definition of Workstream Leader\n## Motivation\n\nThe Marketing workstream has shown what it can do with a shoestring marketing budget:\n\n    February $37,655 (includes 247,000 FOX)\n    March $18,370 (includes 197,000 FOX)\n    April $18,370 (includes 204,000 FOX)\n    May $18,370 (includes 155,000 FOX)\n    June $18,370 (includes 165,000 FOX) + $4200 of (200) KK’s purchased for Merch store\n    July $18,370 (includes 155,000 FOX)\n\nTotal prior labor, marketing, and overhead spend was $133,705 against an approved $129,505. The $4200 delta was made up from the rolled-over Marketing budget.\n\nThe proposed MKBD Workstream is focusing on improving on many KPIs that directly support the Product and Engineering roadmap as well as continuing to build the ShapeShift brand through:\n\n- Driving meaningful revenue through app.shapeshift.com and API sales\n- Growing and evolving KPIs alongside Product and Engineering as more information, data, and product features roll out\n- Maintain the ShapeShift brand, communications, and ecosystem presence\n\n## Specification\n### Budget \n\nThe details below expand upon the budget spreadsheet:\nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NC_d-gIiRb2BxDkGwW9JdtmKp_pDEE7RrFOG40A-m4I/edit?usp=sharing\n\nTLDR: \n\nFixed labor + tooling costs: net -3.86% from SCP-123\n\nBounty+ discretionary + unlockable spend increased 4.9% monthly\n\n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreiheike2mleetf42xusn2poynuygvdijbbsltdg5n4plwdi4q6mrtq)\n    \n\n#### Recurring costs\nLabor\n\n    The budget includes two full-time positions, with Twells (Marketing Communications Lead) paid $53,500 and Hpayne (Workstream Lead) paid $72,000 combination of USDC and FOX over six months. \n    The budget includes TBD unfilled Business Development assistant position(s) at a total cost of $13,500 over six months allocated for this spend. The DAO will unlock these funds once Twells and Hpayne close 3-5 API sales and optimize + validate the B2B sales flow to properly understand costs, ROI, and velocity to make this a profit center.\n    Any contributor reserves the right to take any portion of salary in FOX and locked varieties thereof. Initial commitments from the workstream members entail Twells receiving 9% and Hpayne receiving 17% of their salaries in FOX monthly.\n\n#### Tooling\n\nIn SCP-123, the Marketing Workstream paid service providers (such as SproutSocial, Blaze, and other social + marketing tools) monthly. In SCP-144, no additional tooling funding is requested.\nNon-recurring costs\nMiscellaneous/Contingency\n\nThe budget contains a line item for a monthly $1,500 USDC and $3,500 of FOX for discretionary and unforeseen spending for things such as: ShapeShift swag store products, bounties, graphic design, and other marketing initiatives that have entered into our mix一such as Postmint, user feedback surveys, and reward programs.\n\nThe line item above is provisional, and any unspent funds will be rolled over into the next proposal cycle to mitigate future budgetary asks.\n\nThis budget seeks approval for the commitment of a total of $9,000 USDC and $21,000 FOX for non-recurring costs to be spent judiciously at the workstream’s discretion, shall it be required.\nVariance\n\nUnused funds from any budget category will be kept in the workstream Colony and rolled over into the next proposal.\n\nIn the event that the Marketing Workstream requires more funds, a separate governance proposal shall be raised.\n\n##Deliverables\n###Goals\n\nTLDR:\n\nThis marketing proposal was created with the spirit and intention of alignment and direct support of the Product workstream’s portfolio of bets. Auxiliary activations such as grants, social media, and content deliverables are maintained to ensure the wholistic narrative support around the ShapeShift DAO product suite with the overarching goal of driving $20,000 monthly revenue through the mix outlined below with a vision of $200,000 per month.\n\n### KPIs\n\nCore KPI TLDR:\n\nThe MKBD Workstream is focusing on improving on many KPIs that directly support the Product and Engineering roadmap as well as continuing to build the ShapeShift brand.\n\n\nView an extensive list of past and projecting KPIs here:\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1p86DcW_quPihBIpdTT595Df0uAE_1l7Vh8zkidJ_DII/edit?usp=sharing\n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreid5ddbnxag3tqbdprvmcbudywkfw6px2hvvxaa4d3hhm2jz5dbg6a)\n    \n![image](ipfs://bafkreibf4n65lbiv23tsld6mpl6tvcbrkarbmss6qv27i4uwyadyi3g7ia)\n    \nNote: API Revenue is projected and will shift as product price point, sales process, and TAM is further discovered\n\n\n## Drawbacks\n\nMarketing labor and spending has the potential to be the most elusive to quantify and qualify within the DAO's budget which is why we outlined our goals, spend, and metrics while keeping in mind brevity. Any aspect of these goals and metrics and activations that does not seem appropriate to serve the greater needs and goals of the DAO should be questioned and outlined further so that there is a clear understanding from the beginning what is being worked on and delivered.\n\n## Benefits\n\nFundamentally, the DAO delivers a product to increase ease of use of the multi-chain multi-wallet multi-protocol universe that we find ourselves in. It is the MKBD effort that markets and sells our product while retaining voice and brand image. We need Marketing and Business Development in order to scale and proliferate the ShapeShift product. The goals and tasks listed above will be delivered and likely added on to as the term progresses.\n\n## Vote\n\nFor - Formalizes the community is “for” the details outlined in this proposal \n\nAgainst - Formalizes the community is “against” the proposal",

      "title": "SCP-146: Fund the Tokenomics Workstream in Q3/Q4 2023 and Re-elect Kent as its Leader",
      "content": "SUMMARY:\n\nThis proposal outlines the scope and budget for the next two quarters of the Tokenomics Workstream, from July 1st, 2023 through December 31st, 2023.\n\nQ3/Q4 PERFORMANCE REVIEW:\n\nIn this section I’ll take a look at our stated goals from the prior proposal (Q1/Q2 2023) and evaluate our performance.\n\nPrior goal #1: Runway preservation\n\nSince first taking this role, my number-one focus has been to encourage the ShapeShift community to be wise stewards of its treasury. While the Tokenomics Workstream has no ability to unilaterally make treasury decisions, I believe its guidance and counsel has been invaluable during this protracted bear market.\n\nIn my prior proposal, I discussed the strong likelihood that a challenging crypto landscape would persist in the first half of 2023. As such, a continued focus on runway preservation appeared to be the most prudent way forward. I continued to bang this negative-outlook drum during the various promising-yet-false recoveries in the first half of the year, cautioning the community against basing its planning on even a slight assumption that a more positive landscape would materialize in the near-term.j\n\nIn early-January the DAO had 10-11 months of runway denominated in stablecoins. Currently it has roughly 8 months. This is at the lower end of the range that the DAO has had through most of the bear market. So–in terms of months the runway has been winnowed down slightly rather than “preserved,” but not to a point where the DAO’s short-term existence is threatened. In hindsight I should have used a more specific goal than “Runway preservation”; the spirit of the goal is obvious, but it could have benefited from more specificity. (This proposal does provide a more specific goal).\n\nAs before, the DAO’s ongoing Bond Protocol program has been the prime contributor to its runway extension efforts. However, the TMDC was much more reluctant to use this tool as FOX descended to historical lows. This is the primary reason why the runway has shed two months since the last proposal.\n\nThis presents an intriguing challenge for the DAO–one which fortunately has a near-term solution, as we’ll explore shortly.\n\nStablecoin diversification\n\nWhile this was not a stated goal in the prior proposal, it was highlighted as an important question for the community to explore. It subsequently became an urgent issue during Q1/Q2 that’s worth briefly recapping.\n\nIn the wake of the temporary unpegging of USDC, the DAO found itself in the precarious position of having most of its stablecoin treasury denominated in that asset. The TMDC had taken some initial action to diversify into LUSD, but at less than a month of expenses this was arguably not sufficient diversification.\n\nThus, the diversification issue became a timely and prominent issue–one which was explored and discussed in detail in the various Tokenomics meetings.\n\nFollowing these discussions, the TMDC opted to move a portion of its stablecoin holdings out of USDC. Additionally, multiple subsequent bond offerings provided exposure to LUSD and USDC. As a result, the DAO is now much more well-positioned to weather a depegging event (as of early-July 2023):\n\n571,000 USDC\n\n445,000 LUSD\n\n173,000 USDT\n\nIn a worst-case scenario where USDC went to zero (highly unlikely, given Circle’s post-unpeg decision to pivot out of treasuries), the DAO would still have enough stablecoins to cover roughly three months of expenses. Similarly, a complete collapse of either LUSD or USDT would leave the DAO with several months worth of stables.\n\nThere is no perfect way to manage the various stablecoin risks. But by diversifying out of only USDC, the DAO has diversified these risks in a sensible way.\n\nPrior goal #2: Continue leading strategic discussions\n\nIn my previous proposal I opined that “...we need to stay focused on the high-level elements to ensure we’re on the right track, working on the right things, pursuing our mission, and avoiding the things that can distract us from our goals; a consistent focus on strategy will help make sure that’s the case.” \n\nThus, I took on the responsibility of ensuring that the DAO continued to have regular, community-wide discussions about the most important questions, such as: who are we; why are we here; what should we build; what should we prioritize or do differently?\n\nThanks to these monthly strategy discussions–typically characterized by solid community attendance & robust (and sometimes wonderfully-heated-yet-respectful discussions)–the DAO has been able to maintain that focus. After half a year of having these chats, there now appears to be a better sense of cohesion and agreement among Workstream Leaders about what we should (and should not) be working on.\n\nWhile I certainly can’t take credit for the hard work of, say, the Product Workstream in creating a clearly-defined roadmap (accompanied by clear success metrics), or the Engineering Workstream for its deft allocation of limited resources, I do sense a strong shift away from the more haphazard and less-focused approach the DAO used to take. I believe our strategy chats are part-and-parcel of this shift, as it keeps those crucial existential questions top of mind while also helping get buy-in and support from a broader portion of the community.\n\nOur monthly discussions also help avoid groupthink, which as I mentioned in my BUIDL Asia talk is one of the most dangerous social dynamics for any DAO. These meetings can help us avoid that minority-opinion-stifling and centralizing phenomenon by ensuring all community members have a chance to voice their opinions–especially with respect to questioning the current strategic direction and posturing of the DAO.\n\nPrior goal #3: Continue to conduct and present research, with a focus on Ethereum scalability\n\nIn the first half of 2023, an R&D-driven discussion of Ethereum-based scalability platforms was featured in seven separate Tokenomics calls.\n\nI’m a big believer in a scalable future where Ethereum-based rollups garner the lion’s share of transactional throughput and liquidity. This is not to cast shade upon alternate ecosystems such as Cosmos or Solona. However, due to the superior balance of decentralization and security, for the past two years I’ve been anticipating a future where rollups like Optimism, STARKWARE, ZK-sync, and Arbitrum gain more traction than their “alt-L1” counterparts.\n\nWith this potential future in mind, I’ve made it a point to consistently educate and inform the community about the state of rollups. Interestingly, the metrics on rollup adoption vis-a-vis other ecosystems support my thesis; take a look at DefiLlama or L2beat to see how rollups are, in fact, outperforming other ecosystems. It’ll be interesting to see if this trend holds once the bear market ends.\n\nFast-forward to present day, and it’s wonderful to see that the DAO has exposure to the broader rollup ecosystem with its Optimism partnership. Meanwhile, Arbitrum and ZK-Sync have a presence in our Product discussions. To the extent we can optimize and prioritize towards the rollup world, we may be better positioned to leverage the multi-chain thesis that ShapeShift is predicated on.\n\nFOX is near all-time lows. Hasn’t the Tokenmomics Workstream failed? Shouldn’t it be replaced?\n\nI’m anticipating some community members will have this thought. FOX has dropped to all-time lows and consistently underperformed ETH. Why, then, should the same Workstream leadership be elected to another term? They’ve presided over an excruciating downtrend in the token price that shows no signs of improvement!\n\nMy response to this critique is very simple: it is not the job of the Tokenomics Workstream to make Number Go Up. Nor has it ever been. In prior proposals and meetings I’ve stated repeatedly that the Workstream under my leadership would never encourage the DAO to focus on the token’s price–particularly with tactics designed to boost the price in the short-term, at the expense of long-term viability. This might include hamfisted tactics like token burning, DAO purchases of its own token, and similar approaches.\n\nThe Tokenomics Workstream’s core responsibility is to encourage the DAO to be wise stewards of its treasury and not run out of funds–not to ensure that FOX token exhibits any specific type of price action. If the token does trade happen to trade much higher in the years ahead, it will be because ShapeShift a.) survived the bear market without going bankrupt, and b.) built a platform and/or profitable products with a reliable product/market fit. These are the elements that *may* make FOX move higher eventually–a potential outcome of Tokenomics and everyone else playing their role successfully here at ShapeShift.\n\nSo why is FOX near historical lows? Arguably, a very large portion of the downtrend can be chalked up to the simple fact that in this type of market environment, the majority of non-blue-chip crypto assets are in persistent downtrends. Additionally, the DAO continues to struggle to find that elusive product/market fit. There are certainly promising signs on a number of fronts, but we’re not there yet. Hence the need for a stablecoin runway to provide the DAO with the takeoff room (and more specifically, the time) it needs.\n\nThe price of FOX has never been a direct success metric for Tokenomics, nor should it ever be. This would create a situation of perverse incentives where the Workstream might encourage the community to take short-sighted actions to change the token’s price. This type of financial engineering has no place at the DAO.\n\nAnyone who differs is welcome to vote against this proposal.\n\nIn terms of helping the DAO find a viable business strategy, this Workstream certainly does play an important role. It can also help articulate potential value accrual mechanisms for FOX (as we’ll touch on shortly).\n\nPRIMARY GOAL FOR THE SECOND HALF OF 2023:\n\nEncourage the community to take the necessary steps to maintain the stablecoin runway at or above 8 months.\n\nOnce again, it’s crucial for the Tokenomics Workstream to help the community keep a conservative posture with respect to its treasury. In practice, this means no crazy degen positioning; no wildly optimistic assumptions about when market and industry conditions will improve; and a constant focus on maximizing the time period for the DAO to become self-sufficient.\n\nTo be clear, the hesitancy of the TMDC to continue Bond Protocol offerings with FOX at all-time lows does potentially put the DAO in a very precarious position: unless something else changed, the DAO would only have 8-10 months of runway (the two extra months might be achieved via sales of the community’s non-stablecoin assets, as well as a partial offset of expenses with monthly revenue).\n\nThis is why the timing of the Fox Foundation loan–recently approved by the DAO’s governance process but still awaiting approval from the Foundation’s Board–is so crucial. Simply put, this loan of up to $1 million worth of USDC would provide the means to extend the DAO’s runway by up to six months, from January/February 2024 to July 2024 (assuming the associated revenue-related performance incentives were maxed out). Meanwhile, the DAO would not be faced with the tricky decision of either making its stand with only 8-10 months of runway, or pursuing further Bond Protocol offerings with FOX at historical lows.\n\nThe fundamental stance of the Tokenomics Workstream will not change if the loan is approved; as always, a cautious, deliberate, and conservative approach is the way forward. The TMDC, for its part, might even decide at some point to augment the loan stablecoins with further Bond Protocol offerings. And meanwhile, the performance-based revenue requirement for the loan should ostensibly help the DAO prioritize various initiatives more effectively.\n\nADDITIONAL GOALS\n\nContinue leading monthly strategy sessions\n\nAs outlined above, our regular discussions have helped the DAO talk through crucial issues while involving a larger portion of the community in these discussions. Conversations about strategic direction are always necessary; Q3/Q4 will feature more of the same.\n\nContinue to conduct and present research and analysis on a monthly basis, with a focus on Ethereum-based rollups\n\nSimilar to last term, I see a great deal of value in donning my old R&D hat and continuing to keep the DAO informed about the latest developments around platforms that combine scalability and decentralization. One tantalizing question is: given the emerging, tentative success of platforms like Arbitrum, what can ShapeShift build to better meet the needs of those networks and their users?\n\nBUDGET STUFF:\n\nWorkstream Leader Compensation\n\nThis proposal continues with the previous approach, whereby the Tokenomics Workstream Leader receives $14,000 worth of FOX each month.\n\nAs before, this proposal entails that these monthly salary payments would be made via Boosted FOX Hedgies, with a 12-month timelock. Per the Governance-approved Boosted FOX proposal, this time-locked option provides an extra 20% of FOX (on top of the regular monthly salary) following the end of the lockup period. In the unlikely event that there's a technical issue preventing Boosted FOX payments from being made, payment will default to regular, non-timelocked FOX.\n\nOperating Budget: funding for bounties, audits, and other expenses\n\nThe Tokenomics Workstream currently has 11,600 USDC, after starting the term with 20,000 USDC. Spending in Q1/Q2 totaled 8400 USDC and can be broken down as follows:\n\n1500 USDC: March - ETHDENVER DAO team dinner\n\n1500 USDC: March - DAO sponsorship of KryptoDenver/ETHDENVER brunch\n\n400 USDC: May - DAO sponsorship of PizzaDAO Denver event\n\n5000 USDC: June - Travel (2500) and lodging (2500) expenses for ETH Seoul and BUIDL Asia\n\nI was particularly proud to represent ShapeShift in my talk at BUIDL Asia in Seoul, where I explored challenges and potential solutions around the DAO’s journey over the past 18 months. I also had the opportunity to moderate an Interoperability Roundtable with other experts in the field–an apt fit, considering ShapeShift’s own focus on a multi-chain world. To date, the DAO hasn’t had much of a presence in Asia. It’s my hope that our presence at this conference can set the stage for a further advance into that market in the coming years.\n\n“Thought Leadership” is a cliched term, but it’s super-important from a DAO perspective. We’re out on the frontier. We’re making this shit up as we go along. There is no playbook to follow. If other DAO’s can learn from our successes and challenges, the broader crypto world will be a better place, and the next iteration of DAO’s will have greater odds of success.\n\nMoving forward, the current 11,600 USDC in the Workstream’s Colony should be sufficient to meet operational and logistical expenses in Q3/Q4. Thus, there is no USDC operating budget request in this proposal.\n\nReturn on Investment in a Tokenomics Workstream Context\n\nRecent discussions about each Workstream outlining its own ROI are interesting from a Tokenomics perspective. Perhaps someday the DAO will be in a position where it could earn a return on its treasury holdings, effectively turning Tokenomics into a profit center. However, we appear to be a ways off from this scenario; it would be folly to risk even a small portion of the DAO’s stablecoin runway in order to earn a single or double-digit return in staking or DeFi protocols.\n\nThe lack of a clearly-definable ROI (at least in monetary terms) of Tokenomics is one reason why it makes sense for its Leader salary to be paid in time-locked FOX rather than USDC. Given the focus on preserving the stablecoin treasury, it’s nice to have effectively zero impact on the runway. This arrangement also creates an elegant long-term incentive mechanism; the contributions of Tokenomics are geared toward survival and success over the coming years.\n\nAt the end of the day, the Tokenomics Workstream here to a.) constantly and transparently communicate the state of the DAO’s finances, b.) maintain a culture of financial prudence, c.) encourage a strategic mindset around how the DAO positions itself in the broader crypto marketplace, and d.) help cultivate an environment where civil discourse and respectful debate discourages centralization and allows the DAO to more effectively tap into the collective hive-mind brain of its myriad contributors and members. Continued success on all these fronts would likely mitigate the threat of running out of operating funds, while also putting the community in a better position to succeed over the long-term.\n\n\n\nVALUE ACCRUAL: Why would anyone want to own FOX?\n\nI posited this in the prior proposal, and it remains an important question for the DAO to ponder. It’s also a crucial consideration from a Tokenomics perspective.\n\nOver the past half-year I’ve become convinced that project incubations along the lines of Arkeo could be one of the most powerful value-accrual mechanisms for FOX. Specifically, airdrops of incubated projects might provide a powerful incentive to join the community. Of course there are no guarantees of success–and Arkeo has yet to leave the tentative testnet phase–but there may be a clear, repeatable template here in the ShapeShift-as-an-incubator strategy. I’m looking forward to continuing to advocate for further exploration of projects that might fit this paradigm. \n\nIn the two coming quarters we'll focus heavily on this value accrual piece as part of our regular strategy discussions. It's crucial that the DAO thinks outside the box and considers various perspectives/ideas–both in general, and with this specific topic.\n\nPOTENTIAL DRAWBACKS OF THIS PROPOSAL:\n\nImagine a ShapeShift DAO where there was only an unofficial, non-funded, Tokenomics Workstream. In this scenario, a lot of meaningful work would still get done; the TMDC would still function (its budget is not a subset of Tokenomics), and contributors could still find myriad ways to collaborate–all without needing to spend funds from the DAO treasury on Tokenomics functionality or leadership.\n\nWHAT THIS VOTE DOES:\n\n1.) Fund the Tokenomics Workstream with a monthly Workstream Leader salary of $14,000 worth of FOX (payable in 12-month-timelock Boosted FOX Hedgies, which provide a 20% bonus upon the expiry of the unlock period).\n\n2.) Re-elect Kent as the Tokenomics Workstream Leader from July 1st, 2023 through December 31st, 2023.",

This proposal ensures Globalization Workstream continuing its work and making further progress in the coming term from Aug/2023 to Jan/2024 (6-months). Globalization Workstream recognizes that both the interface and the API (and potentially other initiatives that prioritize products, engineering or marketing) are vital to the DAO at this time and will spend every effort to actively contribute with cross-workstreams demands.\n\n## Abstract:\n\nGlobalization was able to laverage DAOs new integrations and services, the development of FOXatars, also introduced ShapeShift DAO to new global audience. We are experiencing growth worldwide and its part of Globalization mission bring and support all non-US users coming to our DAO and platform/website. The Workstream will also bet on KPIs and proposed an [Attachment to proposal SCP-141](https://shapeshift.notion.site/Attachment-to-Proposal-SCP-141-a3aad95ebd7b49a3b9f0b72f39de9957), establishing a new metric setup.\n\nPast term achievements:\n\n- 15k identified MAUs \n- Language Support (Translations of the app and the official website)\n- Awereness and MKT support\n- FOXatar contributions \n- Strategic events\n- Press-Releases\n- Cross-Workstream support\n\n## Motivation:\n\nThe Globalization Workstream acknowledges the importance of effective communication, community development, and global brand visibility, extending beyond the United States. Expanding into international markets provides opportunities to tap into a larger user base, particularly in countries that prioritize privacy and open-source code, thus positioning ShapeShift tools as a powerful weapon against censorship. With an increasing demand for crypto expansion in Asia, specifically Hong Kong, Africa, and other regions across the globe, the primary objective is diversify the customer user base and identify the best path for DAO international expansion.

      "content": "## Summary/Abstract  - This proposal, the final in the POrtfolio of bets strategy, formalizes framework, sizing, and feature lists on the portfolio of bets for the rest of the quarter.\n\nAbtsract Motivation\nIf the product goals set up mental models, frameworks for collaboration, and an overarching portfolio of bets, this proposal explains the details of bets with timelines of now, next, and later.\n\nFor simplicity's sake, framing initiatives or features as one of three things:\n\n### Rocks\n1. Rocks are big and heavy, they form the basis of our portfolio and will get the priority focus for product and engineering until we have them placed.\n\n###Pebbles\n2. Pebbles are easier to manage but still slippery. Getting them right right requires a few loops. However! the rigor with better long form and mini specs we introduced in the past two months is encouraging. By speccing, spiking, and exploring within the discovery and definition phases, it will be easier placing the pebbles and sand around the rocks.\n\n### Sand\n3. Sand are all the little tasks that don’t quite fit in a mini spec but are just quality of life, polish, and simple additions that make experiences better for users and developers.\n\nNow we have a formula: {the specs give the what and why[ name & business case]} + {the size of the work [rock/pebble/sand],} + {the when [now next later]} + {statuses [draft, discovery, definition, hand off/execution]} = Shipping.\n\n## Specification—Northstars\n\nMarching towards our north stars means planning our roadmap around those three types of work / tagging them as now, next, and later. Adjusting in real time will happen every Monday, as usual. [On this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NJAT22mVg2lwVPMneE4MYjGynl_JRgPY5WnCpec6Eh0/edit#gid=1885592312) and evenutally on our board in Github.\n\n- Get the API to market and get customers paying (25 best case | 3-5 base | 0 failure)\n- Weekly active transactions goes to 300\n- Monetizeable Volume goes above 500K\n- Trading volume gets to 750k.\n- Cumulative transactions goes up ( 70k best 30k base 25k failure)\n\n***Critical note: A roadmap should be considered a ‘point in time’ artifact instead of a contract for the quarter. Things will and do change. This will be updated with living retros as touchpoints along the way. The product workstream lead will aim for biweekly reporting, around office hours.***\n\n## Specification — Portfolio of bets\nWe have bandwidth for around one big rocks running in parallel with a few pebbles, per month. We don’t want to fracture our efforts on shiny sand that take up bandwidth without results. Let's try just 20 things, with most already rolling and see how we improve at allocating human capital towards our bets. \nWe’ve color coded the spreadsheet with green [in progress/complete], orange [still speccing], red [no consensus] features inside the roadmap sheet note that 4 are in progress/complete and 10 are speccing already. Product's goal is to have bets articulated and specced to high quality by EOQ as a base case, and shipped to production as a growth case.\n\n### API bets\n\n- Get API into market & iterate\n- Get API docs good\n- Iterate APi with customers\n- Infrastruucture Optimization\n- Dogfood API into /web\n\n### Interface bets\n\n- Portals (swaps)\n- Portals (defi)\n- Kill splash screen\n- FOX Rewards Spec then Pilot\n- CANNY Feature with hella upvotes\n- Missions\n- WC v2\n- Thorchain\n- Cosmos & Osmosis re-evaluation\n- Monetize Defi\n- Donations\n-stETH\n\n### Obligations bets\n\n- Arkeo (POC & claim page)\n- MM Snaps\n- Frontend and node maintenance\n\n## Benefits -\n- Ships the portfolio\n- Aligns workstreams\n- Allows us to iterate and learn how to improve process and bandwith\n- reduces the product workstyream renewal wall of text\n- gives us goals to refine and report on\n\n## Drawbacks -\n- Does not tie into revenue well enough (we're working on it!)\n- Is a living document\n- **Not all of these will finish shipping by end of September**\n\n## Vote -\nFor - Formalizes the community is “for” the details outlined in this proposal including the high level POB framework and the items herein. Also acknowledges the flexible nature of dynamic market conditions, that this is not a binding contract, the quarter is already started, and the need for alignment above all\n\nFor with changes – Acknowledges the roadmap and points out constructive solutions with concrete suggestions.

      "content": "Summary:\n\nApprove the Operations Workstream with the creation, control, and oversight of a new multi-sig wallet created for receiving payments for the new exchange api.\n\nAbstract:\n\nWith the focus of Engineering and Product turning to to the new exchange api service, the DAO will need to be able to receive payments for tiered usage of the api. Consumers will be able to pay the DAO in crypto for their usage. It is not ideal to have all of these payments be made directly to the treasury. A 2 of 3 multi-sig controlled by Operations would allow the DAO to receive funds across multiple chains and to periodically send collected funds to the treasury at appropriate intervals.\n\nMotivation:\n\nSpecification:\n\nThis proposal seeks community support in authorizing Operations to generate a multi-sig ETH address via Gnosis Safe that will be a 2 of 3 multi sig wallet, of which the signers will be @Tyler | ShapeShift , @Tshifty, and @MBMaria. This wallet will be ETH based for now but should be updated and optimized for multi currency payments for the exchange api services. This new address would be an addendum to the current DAO multi-sig addresses that can be found here: https://forum.shapeshift.com/thread/dao-treasuries-and-multisigs-43646\n\nAdditional responsibilities bestowed to the multi-sig signers of this proposal:\n\nAuthority to create and manage these ⅔ safes on any chain on which the API generates revenues.\nAuthority to convert earned revenues into stablecoins before sending assets to the Treasury address.\nAuthority to transfer a percentage of revenues generated from an integration to the corresponding integration partner (%s and tools for measuring consumption TBD)\nAuthority to transfer balances from the multi-sig to the treasury monthly, or if any muti-sig balance exceeds $10k USD value\nBudget:\n\nNo budget increases are being asked for with this proposal, If passed, the administration of this multi-sig will become another responsibility of the Operations Workstream.\n\nDrawbacks:\n\nIntroduces an additional address to the DAO's growing list of public addresses/multi-sigs. Requires continued trust in the Operations Workstream being good actors with DAO funds.\n\nBenefits:\n\nAllows a separate address for exchange api payments that can be transferred to the DAO and removes complication of all payments being sent directly to the main treasury address.",

      "title": "[SCP-142] Request a loan of up to $1 million worth of USDC from the Fox Foundation",
      "content": "Note: This proposal has been conceptualized and co-authored by various members of the TMDC and Fox Foundation.\n\nSee here for prior discussion around this proposal, including a clarification from the Fox Foundation regarding voting power of the additional FOX it would hold if the terms of this proposal are enacted:\nhttps://forum.shapeshift.com/thread/ideation-scp-tbd-request-a-loan-of-up-to-1-million-worth-of-usdc-from-the-fox-foundation-44954\n\nSummary\n\nThis proposal is designed to provide a clear and unambiguous signal that ShapeShift DAO is requesting a loan of up to $1 million worth of USDC from the Fox Foundation, per the terms listed below. The purpose of the loan is to extend the current stablecoin runway by roughly six months.\n\nMotivation\n\nShapeShift DAO currently finds itself in an interesting position: despite some early successes in building a platform and community based on the core crypto ethos of self-custody, its ability to achieve sustainable autonomy and maximal decentralization is at risk.\n\nDespite extensive budget cuts in 2022, the DAO has not yet been able to generate enough revenues to offset its expenses. There are existing revenue streams, to be sure, and promising opportunities for the DAO to pursue in the near-term. And it may potentially be well-positioned to thrive when bullish market conditions return to the crypto space. However, at the current run rate, it has just 8-9 months of runway denominated in stablecoins.\n\nThis situation has become more precarious due to the precipitous decline in the price of FOX Token. FOX has been a reliable tool, in tandem with decentralized bond sales, to diversify the DAO’s FOX holdings into stablecoins; in recent months this has allowed the DAO to add roughly $50,000 to its runway per month. However, with FOX trading near historical lows, there appears to be insufficient support on the DAO’s Treasury Management and Diversification Committee (TMDC) to continue bond sales at these levels. \n\nThus, if current market conditions don’t change (or even worsen), and the DAO continues to lack sufficient revenue to meaningfully offset expenses, it’s on a path to potentially be unable to sustain operations in less than a year.\n\nIn light of this situation, ShapeShift DAO is requesting a loan of up to $1 million worth of USDC from the Fox Foundation to the DAO. This loan would be 100% collateralized by a transfer of FOX tokens from the DAO treasury to the FOX Foundation.\n\nAn infusion of $1 million in stablecoins would have a notably positive impact on the DAO’s runway, extending it from the current 8-9 months (ending in January 2024), to roughly 14 months (ending in July 2024). These added months would provide more time for the DAO to prove out and bolster its current revenue streams, as well as build out new sources of revenue.\n\nFurther Context on the Fox Foundation\n\nThe mission of the Fox Foundation is to support the decentralization of ShapeShift DAO. There is approximately $4M worth of cash and stables in the Fox Foundation treasury. Its burn rate is approximately $150k per month. That is an approximate runway of 26 months. Meanwhile, ShapeShift DAO currently has approximately 8 months of runway in stablecoins.\n\nIf ShapeShift DAO were to run out of operating capital, the Fox Foundation would have no ability to fulfill its mission of fostering the DAO’s decentralization. Therefore, it seems reasonable that Fox Foundation might consider a direct loan to ShapeShift DAO.\n\n$1M would extend ShapeShift DAO’s runway to approximately 14 months. It would reduce the Fox Foundation’s runway to approximately 20 months. \n\nSpecification\n\nThe loan will act similar to a line of credit, with each transfer subject to the following terms: \n\n0% interest\n15 months to repay, with the clock starting with the transfer of each specific tranche.\n100% collateralization (in $ value of FOX at the time borrowed, using the 24-hour VWAP price on Coingecko (or Coinmarketcap if Coingecko is not available)\nCollateral sent by DAO to separate Foundation-controlled multisig account created for the sole purpose of loan management, as monthly funds are borrowed.\n\nInitially 250,000 USDC will be made available by the Fox Foundation. Beyond that, the amount of available loan capital will increase in monthly increments. Every calendar month, the Foundation will make available an extension of the loan in the amount of 5x the amount of revenue the DAO earned in that month, up to a maximum of $1 million in USDC (calculated at prevailing market prices using Coingecko).\n\nThe underlying goal behind tying part of the loan to revenue is to motivate the DAO to meaningfully improve its performance, rather than use the infusion of funds to simply sustain the status quo.\n\nThe TMDC will be given authority to make these monthly requests on the DAO’s behalf to the Fox Foundation. \n\nSimilarly, the TMDC will have the authority to decide when to repay the loan, and in what amounts, based on the following (assuming the Foundation is amenable to this payoff method):\n\nWhenever the DAO pays X% of the outstanding loan amount, the Foundation transfers X% of the remaining collateral to the DAO..\n\nSources of revenue that would be included as part of the monthly revenue calculation include, but are not limited to:\n\nAffiliate Revenues\nDonations\nAPI revenues, if/when implemented\nDAO’s share of validator commissions\nAnd DeFi activity that does not directly or indirectly sell FOX\nFees charged to users, if implemented\nGrants received\nGrant must be for stables or tokens that are immediately liquidatable\nThe dollar value of any non-stables for the given month will be as reported in the DAO Revenue Tracking spreadsheet (which uses CoinGecko for price reporting).\n\nSpecifically excluded from revenue included in the monthly 5x multiplier are any proceeds from:\n\nDirect selling of FOX\nAny DeFi initiative that indirectly sells FOX\nThere’s a few moving parts here, so let’s take a look at what this might look like using some concrete examples:\n\nAugust 1st: Following approval of this loan by both the DAO and the Fox Foundation, the Fox Foundation transfers $250,000 worth of USDC to the DAO’s mainnet treasury. In a synchronous fashion, the DAO sends a corresponding amount of FOX tokens ($250,000 worth) to the Fox Foundation’s treasury.\n\nSeptember 1st: Per the revenue definition described above, the DAO earns $15,000 in revenue for August. Using the 5X multiplier, the DAO is eligible to receive an additional infusion of $75,000 in September. The TMDC votes to request this full amount. $75,000 worth of USDC is sent to the DAO treasury, while a corresponding amount of FOX collateral is sent to the Fox Foundation.\n\nOctober 1st: $25,000 in qualifying revenue is earned in September, meaning that the DAO could receive another loan of up to $125,000 in USDC. However, the TMDC votes to request just $100,000 for the month. The corresponding USDC and FOX are sent from the respective treasuries.\n\n18 months after the first tranche of $250,000, the DAO pays off that loan by sending $250,000 worth of USDC back to the Fox Foundation. The corresponding amount of Fox Tokens are sent back to the DAO’s treasury (using the X% calculation method described above).\n\nBenefits\n\nThe DAO would be able to extend the timeframe to become revenue-positive. Crucially, this could be done without the need for additional bond offerings or other means for converting FOX to stablecoins. (The TMDC would still have the ability to do so, if it so chose.) The added runway would provide extra time for both the current platform and revenue streams to begin bearing more substantial fruit, and also allow more time for experimentation and pursuit of new opportunities.\n\nDrawbacks\n\nSome community members have expressed concern that a loan of up to $1 million would amount to a “blank check” that would only perpetuate the status quo, at best, and could even create a lackadaisical environment by removing any sense of urgency. Additionally, if the DAO fails to prioritize its work accordingly, it may not earn a sufficient amount of revenue to qualify for the full amount of available capital.\n\nAdditionally, there is some nonzero added risk with another entity holding a large amount of the DAO’s FOX in collateral. However, the authors of this proposal are highly confident that the Fox Foundation employs best practices with respect to its own treasury security. The amount of risk to the DAO would also be greatly minimized by the fact that it would be receiving a corresponding amount of USDC for each FOX that is transferred to the Fox Foundation.\n\nFOR\n\nApproval of this proposal signals that the DAO is requesting a loan from the Fox Foundation, per the terms described above.\n\nAGAINST\n\nA rejection of this proposal signals that the DAO does not want to request a loan from the Fox Foundation.",

      "title": "(SCP 140) Renew Moderation Workstream (jul-dec31 2023)",
      "content": "2023 Jul-Dec Moderation Workstream Renewal\nSummary\nThe Community Moderation Workstream is primarily responsible to support the community and to maintain the integrity of all ShapeShift various platforms such as Discord, The Forum, and Notion. Future platforms that the community chooses to implement may also be included. This workstream is used daily to ensure the smooth operation of the ShapeShift DAO.\nThis proposal is to renew the Moderation Workstream, re-elect Giantkin as leader and fund the workstream through the end of Dec 2023.\n\nTotal Ask is $11600/month. (unchanged)\nNormal USDC monthly is $6410 (depending on Fox choice) some of which is for licenses/botspends that stay in ws treasury, and if unused per term, set aside as possible (small)bounty item, roll over to next Term (stays in Moderation subtreasury until disolved, bountied, or too large - then revert to Treasury.\n\nCharter\nNo other Proposals past/future are to affect this proposal.\nDuring the proposal run, if at any time Moderation lead needs to leave (or be asked to leave)\nthe Leaders group can force vote out the Moderation lead (or put leader on hold). No other method.\n\nTemp position given to other mod members, number 2 first would be put in ‘charge’ until lead returns, or a new lead is voted in.\n-Hiring/firing is solely based on the Moderation leads decision. Based on discussions, Total amount for proposal will be listed, without breakdown, in proposal, but in other places instead.\n\nAbstract\nModeration supports all workstreams and all users within each of the platforms it moderates. As we bring more members into the various platforms, moderators act as so much more than bot managers and spam blockers. Not only do the moderators set up the verification process, they are the point of contact for members having issues with the verification process. They function as the greeters of the DAO, if you will. Our team of moderators clears the path for new members, new contributors and new supporters by facilitating a fluid user experience. Enthusiastic about all things defi and crypto, empowering community members, new and old alike, on their journey to self-empowered entrepreneurism.\n\nMotivation\nThe mission of this workstream is simple: to help people. Moderation is the workstream you never knew you needed, but couldn’t live without. From welcoming new users to setting up Zoom calls to managing bots. Moderation is here to support the community. This workstream strives to create a space that fosters security, growth and innovation.\nOur team of trustworthy, confident and enthusiastic moderators allows for decentralization of community moderation. This may address the point of preventing accusations of vested interest, since only community elected mods have the power to preserve and maintain the DAO culture.\nAs the workstream leader, I want to make the user feel like they are able to relax. Users are most likely talking from their home space, home usually means they feel safe. I want to keep that feeling in our group.\n\nSpecification\nModerators take on wide variety of tasks, including but not limited to:\n\nOrganize user flow via roles, channels and bots\nCreate and maintain scheduled events in sesh & Discord\nProvide protection from scammers\nWarn abusers (strike system established by Giantkin)\nProviding Discord support\nFacilitating ‘temps’ for a job, for example, providing the DJ with a role for the event\nHelp maintain and update server images such as avatars, stickers, emojis, etc. (Emptyslot)\nProvide moderation support (live when possible) for meetings and community events\nDrive users to the proper channels\nContinually monitoring channels, and other server banlists for potential spam/scammers and adding them into our banlist\nTaking part in Support/Ops triage process by shuttling members requesting support to the proper channels, connecting with self help resources, #support,chatwoot, etc as appropriate\nAppropriate use of Admin Power by Moderation Workstream Leader\nEnforce the Current Code of Conduct to the best of ability, with positive intent.\n\nWhat are the goals of this workstream?\n\nProvide 12 hour moderation coverage to ShapeShift DAO’s community channels, with the eventual goal to provide 24 hour coverage\nProactively ban 90% of scammers/bots that try to sneak into ShapeShift discord\nEnsure that all community meetings are scheduled on the calendar\nThe Moderation Workstream is successful when you don’t notice that it’s there.\nDuring the Jan - jun 2023 term, the Moderation Workstream has accomplished the following:\n\nSustainability updates to server roles and channels\nFew problems known.\nTested, added removed tools reporting bots (boardroom vs snapshot for example)\nGated bot install with higher perms than needed.\noverwatched forum setup, and growth.\nwatched 12,000 users in discord!\nAdded Websupport, for Support use and testing. (removed websupport for rethink)\nSetup Forum threads for Stage Events and other meetings. (works great!)\nOther items not included but taken on\nMonthly Foxpayout for contributors: maintain and update sheet monthly. remind WSleaders to update contributors Choice(s), and update their tab. Work with Willy to get things done as timely as possible. -update the fox price on a set schedule/method.\nPraise steward. push for others to use. (slow process!)\n\nBenefits\n\nKeeps the discord clear of spammers\nLimits the Scammers on server\n\nDrawbacks\n\nGrowing member list, growing expense.",

      "content": "# Abstract / Overview\n\nThe ShapeShift DAO relies on the Engineering Workstream to maintain the open source code base, undertake core engineering work to enable new features, support integrations from the broader community, and to provide architectural oversight and technical leadership as we continue to execute the DAO's vision.\n\nThis proposal is to continue to fund the Engineering Workstream's budget from June 1st, 2023 through September 30th, 2023 inclusive (4 months).\n\nThis proposal adopts [SCP-92 Definition of Workstream Leader](https://snapshot.org/#/shapeshiftdao.eth/proposal/0x3529a9ab550387d1eedf34d0ba26b5c80ed1c04a74a3c407d9b06a6ea90325ab).\n\n# Motivation\n\n## Previous proposal\n\nThe Engineering workstream came in under budget of the previously approved proposal.\n\n* February $113,934 (includes $24,825 of infrastructure) and 400,000 FOX.\n* March $85,884 (includes $23,134 of infrastructure)\n* April $85,450 (includes 2 new engineers pro-rated, no infrastructure) and 183,374 FOX.\n* May $100,250 (slight positive variance due to one off payroll alignment) and 362,622 FOX.\n\nTotal labor, infrastructure, and overhead spend of $385,518 USDC against an approved [$580,800](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vOpFwELxFk2vKBGa9GxiQEo3gDGDReJkZVKk3KvMSwE)\n\n## Completed deliverables\n\n* THORChain savers integration\n* Supported completion of Osmosis bounty & integration\n* Wherever notifications (EPNS integration)\n* Optimism integration (grant funding secured)\n* WalletConnect to dApps\n* WalletConnect V2 upgrade\n* LI.FI swap and bridge integration\n* 1inch swapper integration\n* Swapper selection\n* Swapper manual receive address\n* Major swapper performance and architecture improvements\n* DeFi opportunities architecture improvements\n* Polygon chain support\n* Monorepo migration\n* Major performance improvements\n* Gas estimation improvements and EIP1559 support\n* Cluster monitoring\n* Optimism upgrade\n* All UNI V2 LP support\n* Information architecture changes\n* DeFi by position and asset\n* QR code BIP21 support\n* Mixpanel migration\n* NFT basic support\n* Global search\n* Trade donations\n* Trade simulation\n* KeepKey desktop client support\n* Deprecate Portis and TallyHo wallets\n* Equity cards\n* Related assets across chains\n\n## Team\n\n### Existing\n\n* [0xdef1cafe](https://github.com/0xdef1cafe) - Workstream Leader & Senior Engineer\n* [0xApotheosis](https://github.com/0xApotheosis) - Senior Engineer\n* [gomes](https://github.com/gomesalexandre) - Senior Engineer\n* [kaladinlight](https://github.com/kaladinlight) - Senior Engineer\n\n### New\n\n* [humblehound](https://github.com/lmyslinski) - Senior Engineer\n* [woodenfurniture](https://github.com/woodenfurniture) - Senior Engineer\n\n## Mandate\n\nThis proposal seeks to have the Engineering Workstream be the sole maintainers with discretion over CODEOWNERS, permissions and administrative rights of the ShapeShift GitHub namespace. The billing account shall be controlled by the Fox Foundation.\n\nThis is to ensure the DAO maintains a high standard of code quality, velocity, reduced regressions, and has a single core team acting as maintainers responsible for the codebase.\n\nThe Engineering Workstream will work with external contributors to ensure contributions can be made expeditiously while not compromising quality, patterns or stability.\n\n## Budget spreadsheet\n\nThe details below expand upon the [budget spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1uj7ul3DA2mk2M-krXRoWjAk_p5n5jbLKk_qN2aY5wuM)\n\n## Recurring costs\n\n### Labor\n\n* 0xdef1cafe salary reduced 25k due to location change\n\n* Any contributor reserves the right to take any portion of salary in FOX and locked varieties thereof.\n\n* The budget includes two newly filled Senior Engineer positions at a rate of $180,000 each. Welcome to humblehound and woodenfurniture!\n\n### Infrastructure\n\nThe Engineering Workstream previously paid a managed-services provider, TaxiStake, for infrastructure that powers the entire backend of the open source platform and mobile app.\n\nThe Fox Foundation now covers these costs, and the Engineering Workstream is not requesting funds to cover these costs in this proposal. \n\nFor reference previous infrastructure costs are outlined above.\n\n## Non-recurring costs\n\n### Bounty Program\n\nWith the increased engineering capacity and transition of Product Workstream leadership, we are sunsetting the bounty program from the budget, as it has proven to be ineffective.\n\n### Miscellaneous\n\nThe budget also contains a line item for $5,000 USDC of discretionary funds which may be used for travel, conferences, retreats etc, at engineering's discretion.\n\nThe line item above is provisional, and any unspent funds will be returned to the DAO.\n\nThis budget seeks approval for the commitment of $5,000 USDC for non-recurring costs.\n\n### Contingency\n\nUnforeseen costs will arise, and 10% of the USDC subtotal is requested accordingly.\n\nThe budget seeks approval for $37,967 for contingency to be spent judiciously at the workstream’s discretion, shall it be required.\n\n### Variance\n\nUnused funds from any budget category will be returned to the DAO at the end of the budget cycle.\n\nIn the event that the Engineering Workstream requires more funds, a separate governance proposal shall be raised.\n\n# Deliverables\n\n## Goals\n\nThe Engineering Workstream continues on in spirit from the previously approved proposal(s).\n\nThe workstream exists to execute on the shared DAO roadmap, co-creating and executing sustainable data driven roadmap in conjunction with the Product Workstream.\n\nThe DAO recognizes that the crypto ecosystem is rapidly evolving and liable to change quickly. The Engineering Workstream reserves the right to add, remove, or reprioritize goals from this list, with the intent to deliver the most valuable and relevant items expediently to the market.\n\nThe product roadmap, emerging partnerships, and changes in resourcing are all factors liable to change the scope or prioritization of listed goals, however, broadly speaking, we intend to complete the strategic goals that are currently defined.\n\n## Reporting\n\nThe Engineering Workstream will report progress against these goals via the following methods\n\n* availability via Discord, covering most time zones\n* weekly product/engineering public meetings\n* weekly governance calls\n* on demand for any specific deliverable\n\nShould the community request other reasonable forms of reporting they will be considered on their merits.\n\n## Benefits\n\nFundamentally, the DAO delivers a product to increase ease of use of the multi-chain multi-wallet multi-protocol universe that we find ourselves in. It is the Engineering effort that builds our product. We need Engineering in order to thrive. The goals listed above will be delivered.\n\n## Drawbacks\n\nEngineering labor is the most expensive component of the DAO's budget. Any aspect that does not seem appropriate to serve the greater needs of the DAO should be criticized.\n\n# Vote\n\nFOR: Fund the Engineering Workstream from June 1 2023 to September 30th 2023 for $417,633 USDC, with 0xdef1cafe as the Workstream Leader.\n\nAGAINST: Do not fund the Engineering Workstream beyond May 31st 2023.",

      "content": "## Summary\nThe proposal is to renew FOX-XDAI Regen Farm to keep incentivizing liquidity on Gnosis Chain and reward token holders who are supporting the FOX economy.\n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreigdkurtewax7jw3ln4t5sshfu6bpb6nokbuc5disu7utnhyzqsgbq)\n    \n## Abstract\n\nThe FOX Regen Farm gives token holders the opportunity to earn rewards for providing liquidity in FOX and XDai and helped ShapeShift bring new members into its community.\n\nThe last program successfully incentivized token holders to hodl FOX through the downturn of the market and help Shape\n\nHence, this proposal is to create a new FOX Regen Farm for the next 6 months for the FOX/xDAI pair.\n\n> Phase 1 proposal -> [SCP-102] Create a new FOX-XDAI Regen Farm to incentivize liquidity on Gnosis Chain\nXFOX Analytics: https://dune.com/kevle_cr/foxongnosis.\n\n## Motivation\n\nRegen Farm is critical to maintaining FOX liquidity in the Gnosis Chain. To attract new members to our community, we need to have cheaper ways to introduce people to ShapeShift, and Ethereum has proven expensive due to the demand for L1.\n\n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreicl3kyovrlnuemvurs5cfu5mjer2jjjvqqyf5b6xswmc3n6oh45da)\n    \n[The average gwei, during the week](https://etherscan.io/gastracker), is 110, an amount that makes it expensive for people to buy and trade FOX\n\nIn recent months, Gnosis Chain has proven to be a great way to onboarding on ShapeShift. There has been a 25% increase in the number of wallets holding FOX on Gnosis ([250 wallets](https://dune.com/kevle_cr/foxongnosis)), while only 5% on Ethereum ([2.5K wallets](https://dune.com/mareo/shapeshift-fox-token)).\n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreib7rrgw7zyl2xk2t3ouevwpfbi34magmosusmwk3jen3zdv3cfzlq)\n\nWe have an average of 32 active wallets daily on Gnosis Chain, but only 4 wallets on Ethereum.\n\nThe data highlights that there is an active community of FOXes on Gnosis and maintaining a rewards program for xFOX + having liquidity to trade it on the network, is critical for us to continue bringing new people to ShapeShift.\nTo keep this up, we need to increase the liquidity of the FOX token on Gnosis Chain and Regen Farm is perfect for this.\n\nAt the moment this proposal was written, there is [$113.657 USD](https://info.honeyswap.org/#/token/0x21a42669643f45bc0e086b8fc2ed70c23d67509d) in FOX liquidity on HoneySwap, incentivized by the FOX Regen Farm on Gnosis Chain.\n\nThis is an effective and tested solution to increase liquidity on the Gnosis Chain, incentivize holding FOX, minimize sell pressure, keep farmers invested in the long term, and require minimal bandwidth from the FOX team.\n    \n## Specification\n\nA stable asset will act as a force towards a stable price for FOX, that force would be proportional to the liquidity on the pair.\nGiveth is requesting 2% of the FOX rewards to cover the costs of configuring and deploying the farm contracts. Half of both fees would go to the matching fund project on Giveth and the rest to the DAO treasury, where it could potentially be paired with GIV to provide liquidity to both DAOs).\nWe have chosen 750,000 FOX to serve as the liquidity incentive for Regen Farm, aiming to provide an APR of 75%, but should the DAO wish this number to be reduced, it can be discussed as well.\n\n## Benefits\n\nThe creation of the pool brings several benefits to ShapeShift, such as:\n\n- Gain liquidity by crowdsourcing liquidity from token holders who will pair up FOX & xDAI in a liquidity pool.\n- Incentivize holding FOX, mitigating sell pressure on the token\n- Align the incentives of token holders and the DAO with an outstanding investment opportunity (30~75% APR).\n- Strengthens our relationship with Giveth, one of the most reputable DAOs on the web3\n\nThis favors liquidity providers that want to be exposed to FOX in the long term & keeps them invested in the DAO in the long run by streaming the rewards over a period of time (you choose the length up to December 2026).\n\nReady-made UI/UX & development support. All Shapeshift has to do is decide the parameters, supply the reward tokens & be in the loop in coordination with our team.\n\nWe already have been using Giveth Regen Farms for the past 6 months, and it has worked like a charm.\n\nBonus: half of the service fees go to donations to fund public goods!\n\n## Drawbacks\n\n- Cost. Some of the rewards may be farmed by people not aligned with the FOX economy and dumped. It’s worth mentioning that reward streaming mitigates this drawback.\n\n- Exposes 750,000 FOX to smart contract risk.",

      "title": "[SCP 137] Onboard Product & Creative Services Workstream Leader & Team Renewal May - July",
      "content": "Summary - \nAn addendum to [SCP-119](https://snapshot.org/#/shapeshiftdao.eth/proposal/0x88923ec42c50bda2af0037e3e629a1187b9b0796104fc393c06ddf33cf761f15), this proposal onboards 0xFBL as the product workstream leader. The role transitions Tyler’s product responsibilities to 0xFBL over two weeks, supports ramping into the role, and proposes a revised budget from May 1st to August 15. This will alter budgets from SCP 119. \n\n\n\nAbstract - \nAs a product-centric DAO, the Product & Creative Services Workstream is accountable for a number of activities acquiring / retaining users, growing the FOX ecosystem, and achieving Shapeshift’s mission. The goal of this addendum is continuing stability, velocity, and success in the Product Workstream by extending its current timeline, and introducing budget renewal/revision. Nothing in the first two months is intended to change, the original governance approved roadmap continues. 0xFBL will jump into phase 1b on the roadmap and ramp up hopefully to introduce a phase 2 kickoff from the original SCP.\n\n\n\nMotivation - \nThrough the efforts of ﻿@willyfox﻿ , ﻿@0xdef1cafe﻿ , ﻿@0xean﻿ , ﻿@TylerShapeShift﻿ , ﻿@PTT﻿ , ﻿@beard﻿ , and ﻿@Hpayne﻿ , and [achieving the goals in Addendum](https://forum.shapeshift.com/thread/search-42820) to SCP-119, I’m humbly submitting this proposal for joining the Shapeshift product team as the Workstream leader. I bring Shapeshift a diverse level of product and DeFi experience from centralized exchanges and building on protocols. I’ve been a product manager in a few different places namely MakerDAO, Rabbithole V1, and most recently Govrn; I've also had stints at OKCoin and Compound Finance. I’ve experienced product market fit a couple times, have sneaky Figma skills, and just generally am so excited to participate here. \n\n\n\nBy supporting the Product Workstream in the four month budget (April15 - August 15) , the DAO can trial 0xFBL as facilitator, continue building / rolling out new features, improving the user experience of our app, and move forward on user acquisition, retention, and product evolution. My immediate aim for the team is increasing product visibility, improving prioritization, and continuing the best in class experience that users have come to love. \n\n\n\nSpecification - \nThis proposal addendum identifies 0xFBL as the new product workstream leader, onboards 0xFBL into the role, and allots time for Tyler | Shapeshift to pivot back to previous responsibilities while finishing his interim post.  Through this proposal, Tyler will actively work with the current Product Workstream Contributors & proposed Leader, starting with support and guidance but gradually transitioning responsibilities like: \n\n\n\nAdmin, meeting leading and organization, task management, KPI and project tracking/reporting for the Shapeshift product roadmap.\nManaging Budget and workstream contributor payments made through Colony\nAnalyzing and surfacing new revenue streams that are not listed yet in the roadmap, but reporting back to the community with more details.  \n\nShout out PTT for a lot of the legwork here.\n\n- Arranging phase 2 strategy talks, and getting the Phase 2 roadmap proposal posted to the forum and moved through governance.  \n- Organizing and running the Monday afternoon roadmap and timeline meeting and coordinating with product and engineering throughout the week to remove blockers, assist with product related decisions and keep things moving through the feature development process and Product/Engineering status updates throughout the week.\n- Product/Engineering representation at the Weekly Ops Sprint.  \n- Facilitate bi-weekly office hours to provide updates on progress, report on KPIs, and offer space to the community to ask questions, give feedback, and pitch ideas.\n- Draft product specs, review with Beard regarding designs, work with 0xDef1Cafe to evaluate engineering resources, and iterate the feature development process.\n- FBL will provide additional scope to the workstream lead role by synthesizing strategic outcomes for the product team, making phase 2 a reality, and guiding more day-to-day improvements for efficiency and alignment across workstreams.\n- FBL will also spend a significant effort in defining core engagement loops & behaviors for users on Shapeshift, working backwards to activation moments to surface quick wins for development. \n- Orthogonal to this is identifying user buckets or personas, working with marketing and other workstreams. \n- Hosting and Leading Spec breakdowns between Product and Engineering. \nSpinning up regular retros (at either phase completion or large feature completeness)\n- Leading and continuing all scheduled team syncs and 1-on-1s.\n- ﻿@Hoff﻿ , who's currently on retainer to make updates to shapeshift.com on an as needed basis will temporarily report in to Beard on a weekly basis to review needs, design work, etc\n\n\nKPIs from previous SCP: \n\n- Increase Monthly Active Users to 56,713 by end June 2023\n- March optimistic MAUs 27,616\n- June optimistic MAUs: 56,713\n- Increase our WAU/MAU stickiness metric to a minimum of 30%.\n- Triple the amount of average daily defi confirms by June 15\n- Improve the new user experience and decrease our bounce rate (currently at 17.69%)\n- Secure Grant funding from 5 protocols by June 2023\n- Maintain an NPS score of 35 of higher\n- We've been evaluating a different metric: PMF. Either way we will produce a report on satisfaction with Shapeshift. \n- Increase our WAU/MAU stickiness metric to a minimum of 30%.\n- Increase Monthly Active Users to 56,713 by end June 2023\n- March Minimum MAUs 22,500\n- June Minimum MAUs 27,000\n- Evaluate new KPIs mid June; especially focusing on sustainable revenue sharing models, future forecasts, and using data to double down on feature bets. \n- We might also [explore NCT’s](https://www.reforge.com/blog/set-better-goals-with-ncts-not-okrs) a newer product framework for goal setting that may fit with our iterative approach. \n\n\nExecution looks like: \n\n- Representing the product and product workstream to both the ShapeShift and broader crypto community\n- Running consistent retros, learning the dev stack and providing actionable feature scope, revising and projecting the budget, and sequencing the roadmap into digestible phases.\n- Feature prioritization and partnership evaluation.\n- Curating & writing feature specifications (including goals and success metrics), UI/UX designs, product management, and applicable front-end development for features prioritized by the ShapeShift DAO.\n- Updating and disseminating the roadmap via weekly calls.\n- Leading the product syncs in the SS discord.\n\nBudget\nThe Product & Creative Services workstream will consist of 5 members. 3 full-time and 1 part-time, and 1 interim.\n \n![image](ipfs://QmTzRKrtQ4sY2bKU5cEqFJATptYaaTNkJCBXazGvSzr68y)\n\nThe total budget breakdown : \n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreic2n3z5lu6xxoj2i3dukpupbll3q2zwxxup6uurgcliqnx6omlvgm)\n   \nArthur Hayes says: “bubbles in the klerb ain’t free,” so, to meet the DAO’s previous expectations for filling the role, upon passing this vote will approve an on schedule May payout (15th) and starting full-time date for 0xFBL as April 17. \n\nThe Remaining April Budget will be:\n\n$18,583.20 USDC\n$2,750.00 FOX\n$21,333.20 **TOTAL**\n\nThe monthly May - July budget will be:\n\n$37,083.20 USDC\n$5,500.00 FOX\n$42,583.20 TOTAL\n\nThis is a one time additional backpay of $7500 USDC spend for April. I've earmarked an increase in product $1248 USDC spend for June. This is for software we may not end up using. Any funds not used per month will roll over and return to the DAO at the end of the cycle. I'll be taking full stables for the first few months, at which point I'll propose taking a portion in time-locked FOX on our next budget renewal. Skin in the game folks.\n\nFind the full budget here: [LINK](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1kODbBWxbHEuH5S1nHQEgx_hG6kBUXRFjC5QvJDVs_QA/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n\nBenefits - \nFree’s Tyler from dual workstream management, unlocks new features, aligns the team around a strategic lens, and continues execution of the product team’s goals with a more traditional Product focused lead. \n\n\nDrawbacks - \nIt takes time to ramp so hitting all these ambitious goals could take longer than anticipated. \n\n\nVote -\nFOR: You support funding the workstream and the anticipated budget for the next 3 months\nFOR with changes: You like the proposal but would like some changes (please share!)\nAGAINST: You do not support continuing to fund the product workstream",

      "title": "SCP-136: Increase FOX Voting Power required to publish proposals on SnapShot to 10,000",
      "content": "## Summary\nThis proposal aims to ratify the increase in the minimum amount of FOX voting power required to make a proposal from 100 FOX to 10,000 FOX. The purpose of this increase is to mitigate the risk of malicious or spammy proposals.\n\n## Abstract\nHistorically, any ShapeShift user who held a minimum of 100 FOX could create a proposal on SnapShot. On April 12th, 2023, 4 spam proposals were created that did not follow the official FOX Governance Process and were subsequently removed. To prevent the ongoing “attack,” the threshold was proactively increased to 10,000 FOX and an announcement was sent in Discord as well as through ShapeShift’s Push Channel to notify community members.\n\n## Motivation\nBy increasing the amount of FOX Voting power required to make a proposal, the community can make it more costly/difficult to publish malicious or spammy proposals to ShapeShift’s SnapShot space.\n\n## Specification\nShapeShift’s SnapShot Space was already updated to increase the minimum required FOX Voting Power to publish a proposal from 100 to 10,000 FOX. This was done proactively to protect against an ongoing “attack” of the same invalid proposal that had been posted and removed 4 times in the same day. If this proposal passes, the increase to 10,000 FOX will remain in place. If this proposal is rejected, the change would be reverted and the threshold will go back to 100 FOX.\n\n## Benefits\nBy increasing the minimum amount of FOX required to make a proposal, we can ensure that only users with a significant stake in the ecosystem can make proposals and vote on them. This will help to maintain the quality of proposals and ensure that they align with the interests of the ShapeShift ecosystem as a whole. Additionally, it will reduce the likelihood of spam proposals and ensure that only serious proposals are submitted.\n\nAs soon as the threshold was increased to 10,000, the spam proposal that was being posted repeatedly ceased being posted, suggesting that the 10,000 threshold is sufficient for now.\n\n## Drawbacks\n1. While this increases the cost of making a spam proposal, spam proposals will still be possible. The community can consider making an additional proposal in the future to require a minimum Gitcoin Passport score to add another layer of protection.\n2. This increases the barriers for smaller FOX holders to make proposals. However, many active community members do hold at least 10,000 FOX and could always delegate voting power to community members whose proposals pass Ideation but who have <10,000 voting power.\n\n\n## Vote\nYes, ratify the 10,000 FOX voting power minimum to make SnapShot proposals\nNo, reset the minimum FOX voting power to make SnapShot proposals to 100",

      "title": "[SCP - 135] Treasury Signer Selection Committee and formalizing the signing process.",
      "content": "Summary\nThis proposal establishes the Treasury Signer Selection Committee which will be responsible for vetting and appointing new Treasury Signers for the ShapeShift DAO.\nIt also establishes the Treasury Signer role as a full-time paid role of the ShapeShift DAO with a formal job description, duties, standards of conduct, and compensation.\n\nBackground\nThe ShapeShift DAO has control of millions of dollars of funds that it uses to further its mission of building and maintaining the easiest-to-use decentralized interface for blockchains. To sustain the DAO’s activity, including compensating the hundreds of active users who contribute to the DAO and to reimburse their expenses on behalf of the DAO, the DAO treasury must regularly create, sign, and broadcast blockchain transactions. Treasury Signers fulfill this function on behalf of the DAO.\nWhen the ShapeShift DAO was formed, ShapeShift AG appointed an initial set of Treasury Signers to manage its treasury, however, no process was established for what happens when a signer retires, or for appointing new signers to the set.\n\nAbstract\nThe ShapeShift DAO needs to ensure there are sufficient Treasury Signers (TSes) to protect the ShapeShift DAO Treasury. This can be accomplished by delegating this responsibility to a new committee — the Treasury Signer Selection Committee. This committee will appoint individuals who will fulfill the Treasury Signer role for the DAO. The Treasury Signer role will be compensated with 500,000 FOX tokens which shall be issued via a two-year Sablier stream established at the time of the TS’s appointment.\nA formal Job Description of the Treasury Signer role is maintained on the ShapeShift DAO Notion site.\n\nTreasury Signer Selection Committee (TSSC)\nThe TSSC is responsible for ensuring there are enough Treasury Signers appointed to manage the ShapeShift DAO Treasury. If there is not, the TSSC is responsible for researching and vetting candidates in private and appointing new TSes to ensure the business continuity of ShapeShift DAO treasury operations. To minimize the security impact to both the ShapeShift DAO and the Treasury Signers, the identities of Treasury Signers will not be disclosed to the DAO or to the public, and will only be disclosed to members of the TSSC.\nThe TSSC shall be comprised of current workstream leaders of any ShapeShift DAO workstream, provided that the workstream leader has fulfilled their leadership duties for at least eight (8) months.\nWhile it is recommended that no fewer than two (2) and no more than five (5) Treasury Signers be appointed at any given time, the TSSC shall be granted full authority to appoint or dismiss TSes at their discretion to ensure the smooth operation and security of the ShapeShift Treasury.\n\nThis will also include a previous Sablier stream for those who have been signers for the DAO for the previous 18 months to the tune of 750,000 FOX per signer for the time they have committed to doing so, so far.\n\nBenefits\nThe benefits of formalizing this position and offering fair compensation include:\n\nEnsuring there is a process for the continuity of treasury operations for the ShapeShift DAO\nEnsuring the role is properly defined so that there is clarity on TS duties\nEnsuring the role is properly compensated so that candidates are incentivized to apply, and existing Treasury Signers have incentives to continue in their role.\nEnsuring there is a process for vetting candidates without divulging their identity to the public\n\nDrawbacks\nThere is a cost to the DAO to fund these appointments\nThe DAO does not have full visibility into the selection process, so they will have no choice but to trust the TSSC members to make good decisions on behalf of the DAO\n\nVote\nA vote of Yes will establish the Treasury Signer Selection Committee as defined above, and formalize the Treasury Signer role as a full-time paid role of the ShapeShift DAO with 500,000 FOX compensation issued via a Sablier stream over two (2) years.\n\nA vote of No will do nothing.\n\n\nIncubation: https://forum.shapeshift.com/landing?method=share&thread=search-42818&refer_id=28831\nIdeation: https://forum.shapeshift.com/thread/scp-135-treasury-signed-selection-committee-and-formalizing-the-signing-process-43226",

      "title": "[SCP-134] Integrate UMA's oSnap module",
      "content": "For more background and discussion, please see the incubation (https://forum.shapeshift.com/thread/incubation-integrate-uma-s-osnap-module-42927) and ideation (https://forum.shapeshift.com/thread/scp-133-ideation-integrate-uma-s-osnap-module-43105) threads.\n\n## Summary\nThis proposal suggests the integration of UMA's oSnap module by ShapeShift to decentralize and improve the on-chain execution of ShapeShift governance decisions.\n\n## Abstract\nThis proposal recommends integrating UMA's oSnap module into the ShapeShift ecosystem to optimize and decentralize the on-chain execution of governance decisions. oSnap streamlines on-chain voting outcomes and allows DAO members to propose and execute Snapshot vote results, validated by UMA's oracle. The incorporation of oSnap will provide the ShapeShift community with a transparent, decentralized governance process, while its language-based rules offer flexibility for custom rules and upgrades.\n\n## Motivation\noSnap provides a way for DAOs to decrease reliance on multi-sigs and provide communities an increased role in governance and execution of governance outcomes.\n\n## Specification\nIf this proposal passes, the integration of UMA's oSnap module involves the following steps:\n\n1. Add the oSnap module to the ShapeShift Safe through Zodiac.\n2. Set oSnap parameter values for the proposal bond and challenge period. These will initially be set to 100,000 FOX and 48 hours, respectively. In the future the challenge period may be reduced if the DAO determines that invalid transactions are being caught and disputed quickly and consistently.\n3. Configure the oSnap module with the ShapeShift Snapshot Space using the SafeSnap plugin by setting the `umaAddress` value to the address of the oSnap module. \n4. Snapshot proposals can now use Snapshot’s transaction builder to include transaction data that can be proposed and executed on-chain when the Snapshot voting period ends.\n\nAdditional information and a video walkthrough on oSnap deployment can be found in the UMA docs: https://docs.uma.xyz/developers/osnap/osnap-quick-start\n\n## Benefits\nBy integrating UMA's oSnap module:\n\n1. ShapeShift inherits UMA’s network of validators who are financially incentivized to monitor and dispute invalid proposals.\n2. oSnap can prevent common DAO-related issues like treasury mismanagement and delays as it optimizes for transparency and efficiency.\n3. oSnap reduces reliance on core teams by handing control over to the community. Only one person needs to raise a dispute to stop a transaction that was not approved by the DAO from being executed.\n4. Adding oSnap to an existing Snapshot Space and Safe is fast and free. The contract has been audited by Open Zeppelin.\n\n## Drawbacks\nPotential drawbacks of integrating UMA's oSnap module into ShapeShift may include:\n\n1. Depending on the length of the challenge period set on deployment of the oSnap module, this may cause a delay in transaction execution. UMA recommends a challenge period of at least 12 to 24 hours, although some DAOs may choose to make their challenge period longer. The initial challenge period for the ShapeShift oSnap module will be set to 48 hours.\n2. The current ShapeShift proposal process does not always strictly define the transactions to execute in advance, but a typical oSnap flow would be to create a bundle of transactions through Snapshot’s transaction builder, include them in the Snapshot proposal, and then simply execute the transaction bundle by clicking a button on Snapshot after they are approved. If the exact transactions for a Snapshot proposal are not defined in advance, or can not be executed all at once, this may require a more complex flow where the transactions are described in natural language and voted on, and then only after the vote concludes are the specific transactions created, proposed and executed through oSnap outside of the Snapshot interface. This might require extra work and testing to ensure that no additional risks are introduced. However, it is very similar to the current flow where transactions are usually created and executed by the ShapeShift multi-sig after a Snapshot vote.\n\nDespite these potential drawbacks, we believe the benefits of integrating UMA's oSnap module into ShapeShift outweigh any challenges, ultimately providing users with an enhanced governance experience that is significantly more decentralized and trustless than using a multi-sig.\n\n## Vote\nFor: Integrate UMA's oSnap module\nAgainst: Do not integrate UMA's oSnap module",

      "title": "[SCP-133] Addendum to SCP 119",
      "content": "PROPOSAL DESCRIPTION\nThis proposal is an Addendum to [SCP-119] and is in response to the announcement of @Diggy stepping down from the role of Product Workstream Leader and moving on from the DAO. The goal of this addendum is to maintain stability, velocity and success in the Product Workstream through the currently approved timeline and provide support, structure and accountability until a full-time Product Leader can be identified, proposed, and voted in.\n\nSummary:\nIn accordance with SCP-119, the Product Workstream has had their budget approved through June 15th. With @Diggy stepping down before the end of that timeline, this proposal nominates @Tyler | ShapeShift to become the interim workstream leader of the Product Workstream until a new leader is found as well as promotes @PTT from his roles in both Operations and Product to the new full time role in the Product Workstream under the new title ‘Project Manager & Product Analyst’. \n\nMotivation:\nWith @Diggy moving on before the end of the current Product Workstream Proposal, there are areas of responsibility that will be left open to fill in: admin, meeting leading and organization, task management, KPI and project tracking/reporting, among other countless Workstream Leader responsibilities. Tyler has proven capable of supporting workstreams outside of Operations in [SCP-99] in stepping into an Interim Workstream Leader role with the Marketing Workstream until another Workstream leader was identified and proposed. This proposal provides temporary assurance of stability and continued success in the goals outlined through the length of [SCP-119] and maintains the structure of the Workstream for the remaining contributors and greater DAO until a proper future Workstream Leader is established.  \n\nFinding a replacement for the interim leader will be a top priority, and a committee or group of advisors can be formed to help field candidates, hold interviews, and find a new full-time Workstream Leader. Having til June 15 to find the right future workstream leader can provide more assurances to the DAO that we have adequate time to find the perfect fit. If a new Workstream Leader is not selected by the end of the new proposed term limit, a new proposal will be required for renewal of the stream and Interim Workstream Leader.\n\nSpecification\nThis proposal addendum identifies Tyler | ShapeShift as the new Interim Product Workstream Leader. Tyler will assume all Workstream Leader responsibilities as outlined in [SCP-92] for the Product Workstream while continuing his obligations as the Operations Workstream leader, splitting focus and time. No additional compensation is requested.\n\nUnder this proposal, Tyler will communicate and advise actively with the current Product Workstream Contributors and provide support and guidance in: \n\nArranging phase 2 strategy talks, and getting the Phase 2 roadmap proposal posted to the forum and moved through governance. \nWorkstream contributor payments made through Colony\nOrganizing and running the Monday afternoon roadmap and timeline meeting and coordinating with product and engineering throughout the week to remove blockers, assist with product related decisions and keep things moving through the feature development process and Product/Engineering status updates throughout the week.\nProduct/Engineering representation at the Weekly Ops Sprint. \nDraft product specs, review with Beard regarding designs, and continuing the iterative process to prepare a feature for development\nHosting and Leading Spec breakdowns between Product and Engineering. \nScheduling the Osmosis retro and when to prioritize the next phase\nLeading and continuing all scheduled team syncs and 1-on-1s.\nHoff, who's currently on retainer to make updates to shapeshift.com on an as needed basis will temporarily report in to Beard on a weekly basis to review needs, design work, etc\n\n\nAdditionally under this proposal, @PTT will be moving his focuses and DAO responsibilities to be more aligned with a promotion and title change to a full time Product Workstream contributor with the new title, Project Manager & Product Analyst.\n\nUnder his new title and role, @PTT will find new and more detailed responsibilities in:\n\nContinuing to track results from Phase 1 strategy data and build forecasts based on specific ShapeShift user data to inform future features and integrations. \nTracking and reporting on Workstream goals and KPIs.\nCollaborating with Beard on getting data from Mix Panel and helping present during Product Office Hours and AllFox meetings. \nAssist with the creation and completion of Product specs.\nMaintain the Partnership flow and assist with the ShapeShift DAO Grant Committee. \nAdhoc Product related requests from other DAO Workstreams. \n\nOperations lost an additional member of the current Operations Workstream at the end of March with @WesleyGraves leaving his contributor role. There is a strong acknowledgement that Tyler’s interim position and @PTT’s new full time role are only made possible by the remaining Operations Workstream contributors, @Tshifty and @MBMaria stepping up to take on new delegated tasks and responsibilities.  As there are 2 Operations Assistant roles being absorbed in the remaining Operations Workstream, @Tshifty and @MBMaria will both be receiving a promotion from Operations Assistant to Operations Coordinator.\n\nThis proposal expedites a search for a new Product Workstream leader to be identified and integrated, and upon transition, Tyler will wind down interim responsibilities and resume full focus back to the Operations Workstream.  \n\nBudget\nBoth the Product and Operations Workstreams will see decreases in their monthly spend if this proposal passes. \n\nThe currently passed Product Budget has a monthly spend of: \n$28,245 in USDC\n$8,587 in FOX\n$36,832 Total\n\nThe new Product Budget would be: \n$22,081.92 in USDC\n$5,500 in FOX\n$27,581.92 Total\n\nThis is a decrease in Monthly Product USDC spend by $5,413.08, and a decrease in total Monthly Product spend by $9,250.08.\n\nThe currently passed Operations Budget has a monthly spend of:\n$32,425.00 in USDC\n$11,325.00 in FOX\n$43,750.00 Total\n\nThe new Operations Budget would be: \n$26,500.00 in USDC\n$8,000.00 in FOX\n$34,500.00 Total\n\nThis is a decrease in Monthly Operations USDC spend by $5,925, and a decrease in total Monthly Operations spend by $9,250.\n\nThe total decrease in monthly USDC spend for this proposal would be $11,338.08, and the decrease in total monthly spend between the two workstreams would be: $18,500.08\n\nBenefits:\nThis proposal keeps an interim leader at the helm of the Product Workstream that has the full backing and support from this workstream with a proven track record for management and overseeing complicated and complex processes. This also provides support and provides additional time to find the right Product person to fulfill the role.\n\nDrawbacks\nTyler | ShapeShift will be operating as a Workstream Leader for two workstreams for a limited amount of time",

      "title": "[SCP-132] Amendment to the Conflicting Votes section of the FOX Governance Process",
      "content": "## Summary\nAn issue was recently identified with the ‘Conflicting Votes’ process defined in the FOX Governance Process. If passed, this proposal will address the issue by updating the ‘Conflicting Votes’ instructions.\n\n## Abstract\nThe FOX Governance process currently includes the following instructions for how to handle Conflicting Votes:\n\n“From time to time there may be conflicting proposals. To avoid issues, the Ideation phase can also serve as time for anyone to list their preferred alternative option on the forum. Each proposal on an associate topic will have a [TOPIC] block placed in its title.\n\nAfter that time, a formal proposal will be put forward including all options available to move forward with that received majority support in Ideation.\n\nThis will ensure that everyone has the ability to surface their preferences while keeping decision timelines reasonably short.”\n\nFun fact: this language was forked from Gitcoin DAO’s Governance Process 💚\n\nHowever, ShapeShift’s governance process differs from Gitcoin’s in that there is a mandatory 3-day phase prior to the Ideation phase known as Incubation.\n\nRecently, while SCP-131 was in Ideation, a counter proposal, SCP-128, was submitted to the Incubation stage. By the time SCP-131 had passed Ideation, SCP-128 had not yet been submitted to Ideation. This begged the question as to whether SCP-131 could proceed to the official voting phase or needed to wait to see if SCP-128 entered and passed Ideation so the Conflicting Proposals process could be applied. In this case, the proposer of SCP-131 kindly agreed to wait for SCP-128 to go through Ideation, but noted that the Conflicting Votes process should be amended to prevent indefinite delays in the future.\n\n## Motivation\nThis proposal updates the language of the Conflicting Votes section of the FOX Governance Process to prevent indefinite delays in the Governance Process and to provide clear guidance to the community for when a counter proposal must be submitted in order for the Conflicting Votes process to apply.\n\n## Specification\nIf this proposal is passed, the Conflicting Votes section of the FOX Governance Process will be updated to the following:\n\n\n**Conflicting Proposals**\n\nConflicting proposals are proposals that are active at the same time and address the same issue or are mutually exclusive.\nIn the case of a conflicting proposal, the Ideation phase can also serve as time for anyone to post their preferred alternative option on the forum. For the Conflicting Proposals process to apply, counter proposals must be published in [Proposal Discussion](https://forum.shapeshift.com/category/6) before the Ideation phase of the original proposal concludes, and should include \"[Counter Proposal to SCP-X]\" where X is the corresponding SCP#. To avoid delays in the governance process, any counter proposal that follows the format requirements of Ideation and is published before the conclusion of the original proposal must be included as a voting option when the Original proposal is put up for final vote.\n\n## Benefits\nThe proposed improvements to the Conflicting Votes section provide necessary clarity and time constraints. \n\n## Drawbacks\nThese changes would enable any properly formatted counter proposal to skip the ideation process and go straight to final governance, which could result in un-vetted ideas as proposal options or even passing. It also provides less space for feedback and iterations on counter proposals.\n\nHowever, if a counter proposal isn't viable, it's less likely to pass. Further, counter proposals can still gather feedback and continue being iterated on until the final proposal is published.",

      "title": "[SCP-130] An Operative Definition of Privacy, an addendum to [SCP-80]",
      "content": "Summary\n\nIn SCP-80, ShapeShift Product Workstream leader Diggy made the case for data analytics to inform our path to product market fit, and the proposal passed Snapshot at the beginning of June. Pendo was formally integrated with the ShapeShift app at the start of Q3 2022, and the Product and Marketing workstreams started tracking data on our product features for those who have opted in to sharing anonymized in-app action data. In addition to Pendo, the two workstreams will continue to explore ways to pull on-chain data as well as structure and synthesize in-depth in-app data to give us new and more comprehensive insights with the goal of improving our product, messaging, marketing, and business development strategies.\n\nThis proposal is intended to address the issue of privacy as it relates to tracking user data and actions both on and off the app. The Product and Marketing workstreams recognize and respect the role of privacy in the ethos of the ShapeShift DAO. We would like to work with the community to establish a working definition for privacy that can be used to enhance operational efficiency within the workstreams of the DAO with the goal of using this definition to improve the efficiency of delegated decisions.\n\nAbstract\n\nIf this proposal passes, the DAO will have successfully established an operative meaning for privacy that can empower workstreams to make autonomous decisions while remaining within the bounds set by the community. This definition would negate the current need to pass a governance proposal each time the Product or Marketing workstreams intend to test a new type of user behavior through data tracking for the purposes of improving user features and constructing effective marketing funnels as long as the feature or strategy falls within the bounds of the definition. If these powers were ever abused and/or used in such a way as to concern the community, the DAO can amend the working definition established by this proposal to narrow its scope appropriately.\n\nMotivation\n\nThe primary motivation for this proposal is to increase efficiency of decision making related to the application of user data tracking within the ShapeShift app. Developing high-performing product features and marketing campaigns is a unique challenge in Web3, as there is a de facto expectation of data pseudonymity. In addition, the DAO is committed to offering a private version of our app that does not include any analytics or tracking. As a result, we are looking for creative ways to gather and synthesize the data necessary to determine answers to the key questions raised by Diggy in SCP-80\n\nA clear definition of privacy and subsequent delegation of related decision making to the Product and Marketing workstreams would improve our ability to develop data gathering strategies required to answer these questions.\n\nSpecification\n\nThe proposed working definition for privacy is as follows:\n\n“Data privacy” means the ability of a user to determine when, how, and to what extent their personal information is shared with others as well as how that data is correlated with other trackable/metricisable events inside and outside the application.\n\nAs mentioned above, ShapeShift currently maintains a private version of its app so users can opt out of data collection entirely. This option ensures the DAO offers a version of the product that guarantees complete data privacy一upholding the most extreme interpretation of “no tracking/no data collection”.\n\nImportantly, the definition of “data privacy” above will be used to create a framework for data privacy decisions related to users who login via app.shapeshift.com.\n\nData Tracking Details:\nData: Anonymized click-throughs and user journey\n\nThe previous proposal explicitly excluded sending hashes of users' public keys. This proposal seeks to update that to permit tracking of anonymized data for the purposes of product improvement.\n\nHashed wallet id\nHashed public keys\nAsset ids belonging to public keys\nTotal portfolio (wallet) fiat balances\nAccount balances, in fiat and crypto units\n\nBy hashing a user’s wallet id (a uniquely generated string) and associated public account ids (per chain), we will be able to derive insights and make better product decisions around user persona profiles and how different types of users are using the app.\n\nHashes are unique and not reversible - this does not enable us to deanonymize a user from hashed data back to public keys.\n\nPrivate keys, or encrypted or hashed versions, never have or will be tracked.\n\nWhen: user data is collected from the moment a user enters app.shapeshift.com and agrees/opts in to sharing anonymized user data. Mobile app users are tracked as part of the terms of service.\n\nNo personal identifiable information will ever be tracked.\n\nHow and to what extent:\nAnalytics will track anonymized click events within our app for the purpose of understanding user retention rates, which features our users adopt, identifying drop offs or potential issues in our user flows, and to generally understand how users navigate throughout our application. We may sometimes also use an analytics tool to run anonymous surveys or polls with our users, to help inform product decisions or gather feedback. In some cases it could also be used to identify the parts of the world our users are in and how they first entered the ShapeShift ecosystem. This information will be used to help us with SEO, user acquisition funnels and marketing strategy.\n\nOn-chain tracking will respect the pseudonymity of user wallets, and utilize analytics for critical business tasks such as building complete marketing funnels, feature planning, feature utilization and verifying partner revenue reporting.\n\nThe anonymized data collected via the ShapeShift app will be available through the analytics provider/s and analytic platform access will be granted to relevant workstream contributors and shared during calls or office hours with the community.\n\nShapeShift will:\n• Never have access to users private keys nor collect any personal information\n• Never collect a users IP address\n• Never sell user data\n• Never gate features for users that opt-out of sharing data\n\nBenefits\n\nDefining “privacy” and allowing Product and Marketing Workstreams to explore various data collection strategies will allow these Workstreams to further measure the success of our products leading to better feature engagement, higher user retention and finding the best product market fit. This definition will give parameters for workstreams to operate so that the core values of the DAO一such as privacy一can continue to be scrupulously upheld while giving workstreams the agency to operate effectively within those confines.\n\nUsers will continue to have the option to opt-in to sharing data or choose to proceed with the complete “Private” version that collects no data of any kind.\n\nDrawbacks\n\nGiving workstreams the agency to implement tracking within these confines means that the broader community will have less jurisdiction over the specific tools implemented by workstreams in the future to collect, synthesize, and aggregate data. As long as the strategy falls within the bounds set by this proposal, a workstream would have the authority to execute on it.",

The billing account shall be controlled by the Fox Foundation.\n\n\n\nThis is to ensure the DAO maintains a high standard of code quality, velocity, reduced regressions, and has a single core team acting as maintainers responsible for the codebase.\n\n\n\nThe Engineering Workstream will work with external contributors to ensure contributions can be made expeditiously while not compromising quality, patterns or stability.\n\n\n\n## Budget spreadsheet\n\n\n\nThe details below expand upon the budget spreadsheet https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vOpFwELxFk2vKBGa9GxiQEo3gDGDReJkZVKk3KvMSwE\n\n\n\n## Recurring costs\n\n\n\n### Labor\n\n\n\n* Any contributor reserves the right to take any portion of salary in FOX and locked varieties thereof.\n\n\n\n* The budget includes provision for two new open positions at a rate of up to $210,000 each, denominated in USDC.\n\n\n\n### Infrastructure\n\n\n\nThe Engineering Workstream pays a managed-services provider, TaxiStake, for infrastructure that powers the entire backend of the open source platform and mobile app.\n\n\n\nInfrastructure costs exceeded our forecasts in the previous budget cycle, due to multiple factors.\n\n\n\n* A migration of the development cluster from the Fox Foundation to under the DAO's control, via TaxiStake. The development cluster is necessary for addition of new nodes/chains, local and hosted development environments, upgrades, rolling out breaking changes with blue/green deployments etc. This is another progressive decentralization step, where the costs of the development cluster were hidden and previously absorbed by the Fox Foundation.\n\n* Addition of archival nodes to the infrastructure. Within this budget cycle, this will allow us to remove reliance on Etherscan for internal transaction data required for balance and transaction history, and Infura for archival node data.\n\n* Node snapshots of synced or syncing nodes - cloud storage costs are expensive.\n\n* Additional EVM chains, namely Optimism - EVM nodes are expensive by virtue of storage and data.\n\n\n\nThe following factors are expected to increase the infrastructure costs slightly during the next budget cycle:\n\n\n\n* the addition of more EVM chains, namely Binance Smart Chain and Polygon, requiring archival node syncs, and multiple snapshots, and data ingress.\n\n\n\nThe following factors are expected to decrease the infrastructure costs slightly during the next budget cycle:\n\n\n\n* Negotiated lower margin with TaxiStake. Previously a 50% markup was applied to the underlying infrastructure costs, this has been reduced to 30%.\n\n* Removal of EVM full nodes (Ethereum/Avalanche/Optimism), once archival nodes are fully synced.\n\n* Removal of outdated snapshot data for currently syncing nodes.\n\n* Migration of API layer from `eu-west-1` to `us-east-1`, reducing application layer costs by 50%, though this may not be worth the labor cost to enact.\n\n\n\nTaxiStake is currently forecasting a bottom line cost of $22,100 for February.\n\n\n\nThe numerous factors above make an accurate forecast difficult. Overall, we are expecting a slight net increase in costs, and are requesting $120,000 USDC for expected infrastructure costs, based on an expected maximum $30,000 for four months. Failure to cover these costs will lead to a 100% production outage.\n\n\n\n## Non-recurring costs\n\n\n\n### Bounty Program\n\n\n\nAs discussed and largely agreed within the community, the bounty program in its previous form had significant flaws. We are requesting $8,000/month worth of FOX, ~200,000 FOX at current prices, to provision for further experiments with tightly controlled scopes of work that are timely and aligned with the shared roadmap where possible. \n\n\n\n### Miscellaneous\n\n\n\nThe budget also contains a line item for $5,000 USDC of discretionary funds which may be used for travel, conferences, retreats etc, at engineering's discretion.\n\n\n\nThe line item above is provisional, and any unspent funds will be returned to the DAO.\n\n\n\nThis budget seeks approval for the commitment of $5,000 USDC and $32,000 worth of FOX for non-recurring costs.\n\n\n\n### Contingency\n\n\n\nUnforeseen costs will arise, and 10% of the USDC subtotal is requested accordingly.\n\n\n\nThe budget seeks approval for $52,800 for contingency to be spent judiciously at the workstream’s discretion, shall it be required.\n\n\n\n### Variance\n\n\n\nUnused funds from any budget category will be returned to the DAO at the end of the budget cycle.\n\n\n\nIn the event that the Engineering Workstream requires more funds, a separate governance proposal shall be raised.\n\n\n\n# Deliverables\n\n\n\n## Goals\n\n\n\nThe Engineering Workstream continues on in spirit from the previously approved proposal(s).\n\n\n\nThe workstream exists to execute on the shared DAO Roadmap Proposal SCP-121: Roadmap Proposal Jan - Mar 31, 2023  https://snapshot.org/#/shapeshiftdao.eth/proposal/0x5f7f4b731874f6b1d32405c0842223687c32625fb99064ab0a5bbc552563bed1\n\n\n\nThe DAO recognizes that the crypto ecosystem is rapidly evolving and liable to change quickly. The Engineering Workstream reserves the right to add, remove, or reprioritize goals from this list, with the intent to deliver the most valuable and relevant items expediently to the market.\n\n\n\nThe product roadmap, externally posted bounties, emerging partnerships, and changes in resourcing are all factors liable to change the scope or prioritization of listed goals, however, broadly speaking, we intend to complete the strategic goals that are currently defined.\n\n\n\n## Reporting\n\n\n\nThe Engineering Workstream will report progress against these goals via the following methods\n\n\n\n* availability via Discord, covering most time zones\n\n* weekly product/engineering public meetings\n\n* weekly governance calls\n\n* on demand for any specific deliverable\n\n\n\nShould the community request other reasonable forms of reporting they will be considered on their merits.\n\n\n\n## Benefits\n\n\n\nFundamentally, the DAO delivers a product to increase ease of use of the multi-chain multi-wallet multi-protocol universe that we find ourselves in. It is the Engineering effort that builds our product. We need Engineering in order to thrive. The goals listed above will be delivered.\n\n\n\n## Drawbacks\n\n\n\nEngineering labor is the most expensive component of the DAO's budget. Any aspect that does not seem appropriate to serve the greater needs of the DAO should be criticized.\n\n\n\n# Vote\n\n\n\nFOR: Fund the Engineering Workstream from February 1 2023 to May 31st 2023 for $580,800 USDC and $32,000 worth of FOX, with 0xdef1cafe as the Workstream Leader.\n\n\n\nAGAINST: Do not fund the Engineering Workstream beyond January 31st 2023.",

      "title": "[Ideation] SCP-128 - Enable opt-out donations instead of fees",
      "content": "For more background and discussion, please see [[Incubation] Enable opt-out donations instead of fees](https://forum.shapeshift.com/thread/incubation-enable-opt-out-donations-instead-of-fees-42049)\n\n### Summary\n\nThis proposal will grant authority to the leaders of the Product and Engineering Workstream to implement optional, opt-out donations for any features offered in the ShapeShift App. The optional donations will be clearly visible in the UI (not hidden), and users will have the option to save their preference on their device. As long as both the Product and Engineering workstream leader agree, they will have the power and flexibility to implement these donations however they determine is in the best interest of the DAO until this authority is revoked.\n\n### Abstract\n\nThis proposal was created as a counter proposal to [Added fees for Thorchain swaps](https://forum.shapeshift.com/thread/ideation-added-fees-for-thorchain-swaps-41991)\n\nCurrently, ShapeShift’s application (https://app.shapeshift.com or https://shapeshiftdao.eth.limo/) is an open-source public good that does not add any additional fees onto protocols or services that it integrates. As one alternative business model, the DAO has established affiliate revenue relationships with multiple partners including fiat on/off ramps, DEXs, Name services, Yield aggregators, swag stores, hardware wallets, and validator operators. Once ShapeShift finds product market fit and attracts more users, this model could enable ShapeShift’s application to remain free forever and generate more than enough revenues to cover expenses and fund growth.\n \n![No fees + FOX Rewards.png](ipfs://bafkreigsgarisa4io2wyt6tr7uu5gsixlk6mmk5onswk2su7ltel74vszm)\n\n“Free” is a [powerful concept](https://www.google.com/search?q=dan+ariely+power+of+free&oq=dan+a&aqs=chrome.0.69i59j46i433i512j69i57j46i433i512j46i131i433i512l3j69i60.1188j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8#ip=1) in and of itself, and the community has the unique opportunity to take this one step further by not only not adding fees, but also sustainably rewarding users who generate revenue for the DAO via their activities in the app with FOX tokens. This could be a disruptively powerful model that could make ShapeShift objectively the best way to use a growing number of crypto protocols and services. This is a model in which users would have to be crazy to not use ShapeShift. This is a model that makes me bullish on the ShapeShift community’s ability to buidl the ultimate interface to the decentralized universe and cultivate unstoppable/unforkable network effects.\n\nI talk about this model in depth in this presentation from ETHDenver 2021: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-TOlyguMjQ \n\nWhile the DAO is actively generating ~$10k/mo via the affiliate revenue model, current operating expenses are closer to $200k/mo, and the DAO is not profitable with current usage levels and market conditions. With the hope of extending runway and one day being profitable, a proposal has been made to experiment with adding fees onto protocols that ShapeShift integrates. While this proposal has positive intentions to increase the chances of ShapeShift’s survival and success, multiple community members and contributors have expressed concerns that adding any fees could have the opposite effect. \n\nTo summarize some of the arguments against the fee experiment:\n\n* Fees alone are not a solution. Ultimately the DAO needs to attract an order of magnitude more users, and fees make it more difficult to attract and retain users.\n* An experiment is not needed to prove that users would prefer not to pay fees, and it will be difficult to draw any conclusive results from the experiment. If usage did increase with fees, how could one know how much usage there would be without fees?\n* Pursuing grant funding for integrating features that are already aligned with the DAO’s roadmap has the potential to generate far more revenue than fees during the bear market, and abandoning the no-fee public good model could arguably harm the DAO’s grant-fundability\n\n\nTo summarize the arguments for no fees:\n\n* There is no issue with the current business model. Fees or no fees, the DAO needs to attract an order of magnitude more users. By remaining free (or even better, being free and rewarding users who generate revenue for the DAO with FOX), the DAO has the greatest potential to not only survive the bear market, but thrive, and achieve the community’s vision of building the ultimate interface to the decentralized universe.\n* In addition to fees being a race to the bottom, ShapeShift’s application is entirely open-source. If the DAO did manage to achieve product market fit, it would be very easy and compelling for a single engineer to fork ShapeShift, launch their own governance token, and pursue the no fees + governance token reward strategy. If someone did this, their offering would be objectively better, and ShapeShift would be at a risk of a vampire attack, similar to when SushiSwap forked Uniswap and sucked out the majority of their TVL in the course of 1 week with minimal effort. This risk is not a fantasy, but the status quo; whenever any open-source protocol in Web3 realizes product market fit, these forks should be expected. With opt-out fees, the DAO would be in a better position to defend against this attack vector.\n* The DAO has not yet attempted the no fee + FOX reward model, largely because it spent the first 1.5 years of its existence focused on rebuilding/open-sourcing the legacy application and architecting it for full decentralization. Before throwing in the towel and adding fees on top of decentralized protocols, the DAO should experiment with rewarding users who generate revenue for the DAO with FOX tokens.\n\nThrough the lively community debate(s) on whether or not to experiment with adding fees, a new idea emerged (h/t @graymachine and @hornyfox) to implement optional, opt-out donations. This is the same model that both Giveth and Gitcoin have implemented that enables them to generate revenue and build network effects without mandatory fees, arguably much more than they would generate with fees. For such a controversial, divisive topic, I see this proposal as a solid middle ground which satisfies many of both camps’ desires while also alleviating many of their concerns.\n\n![Optional donations - Giveth.png](ipfs://bafkreiebksttud5v6otzxmvsbkvl2u6z4jofmcgky6fp4c7qzms44e3d7q)\n\n### Motivation\n\n* **More valuable data:** The data ShapeShift will get from whether or not users are opting-out of fees will give a good idea as to how much users really care about fees. On the other hand, if ShapeShift simply enables fees on THORChain swaps as currently proposed, it will be difficult to draw any conclusions.\nMore public goodness - ShapeShift can remain a free, open-source public good, which is a powerful meme, particularly in Web3, and particularly as a community-owned DAO. It also doesn’t require updating existing marketing messaging, and mitigates the risk of upsetting community members or users that were promised ‘no fees forever.’\n* **More revenues:** The opt-out approach has the potential to generate more revenues than mandatory fees, while also alienating fewer users. Further, this proposal grants authority to add opt-out donations to more features than just THORChain swaps, and also doesn’t require removing existing affiliate revenue streams. If this proposal passes, ShapeShift could potentially offer opt-out donations, still generate affiliate revenues, and reward users that generate revenue for the DAO with FOX. Remaining as a public good could also support the DAO’s efforts to continue securing grants.\n* **Less fees:** Another motivation for this proposal is to offer a compelling alternative to adding mandatory fees and to buy time for the community to experiment with the no fees + FOX rewards model.\n\n### Specification\n\nThe optional donations should be implemented in a way such that the donation amount is clear/not hidden, users can easily opt-out of donating, users can save their preference to opt-out locally on their devices, and no additional transactions are required from the user.\n\nThis proposal is purposefully left vague to give flexibility to the Product and Engineering workstreams to implement the optional donations on whichever features and in whichever way they best see fit. Both the product (Diggy) and engineering (0xdef1cafe) workstream leaders expressed in the Incubation post that they are not worried about the lift nor UX implications and that if this proposal were to pass, their workstreams would do the necessary work.\n\n### Benefits\n\n1. Increase revenues and runway\n2. Maximize user growth and retention/minimize user friction\n3. Maximize grant-fundability\n4. Maintain value prop of “free,” public good status, and meme-power\n5. Buy time to experiment with no fees + FOX rewards, which could help the DAO in achieving strong and defensible product market fit\n\n### Drawbacks\n\n1. Even though donations are optional, they could add a slight amount of friction to the UX relative to the current status quo of no fees nor opt-out donations\n2. It’s possible that optional donations would result in less revenues than mandatory fees \n3. Mandatory fees would not be added to THORChain swaps, and the DAO would not be able to see the results of that fee experiment unless another proposal was passed in the future\n\n### Vote\n\n**For:** Implement optional, opt-out donations rather than mandatory fees\n**Against:** Do not implement optional, opt-out donations\n    ",

      "title": "[Ideation] An Operative Definition of Privacy, an addendum to [SCP-80]",
      "content": "Summary\n\nIn SCP-80, ShapeShift Product Workstream leader Diggy made the case for data analytics to inform our path to product market fit, and the proposal passed Snapshot at the beginning of June. Pendo was formally integrated with the ShapeShift app at the start of Q3 2022, and the Product and Marketing workstreams started tracking data on our product features for those who have opted in to sharing anonymized in-app action data. In addition to Pendo, the two workstreams will continue to explore ways to pull on-chain data as well as structure and synthesize in-depth in-app data to give us new and more comprehensive insights with the goal of improving our product, messaging, marketing, and business development strategies. \n\nThis proposal is intended to address the issue of privacy as it relates to tracking user data and actions both on and off the app. The Product and Marketing workstreams recognize and respect the role of privacy in the ethos of the ShapeShift DAO. We would like to work with the community to establish a working definition for privacy that can be used to enhance operational efficiency within the workstreams of the DAO with the goal of using this definition to improve the efficiency of delegated decisions.\n\nAbstract\n\nIf this proposal passes, the DAO will have successfully established an operative meaning for privacy that can empower workstreams to make autonomous decisions while remaining within the bounds set by the community. This definition would negate the current need to pass a governance proposal each time the Product or Marketing workstreams intend to test a new type of user behavior through data tracking for the purposes of improving user features and constructing effective marketing funnels as long as the feature or strategy falls within the bounds of the definition. If these powers were ever abused and/or used in such a way as to concern the community, the DAO can amend the working definition established by this proposal to narrow its scope appropriately.  \n\n\nMotivation\n\nThe primary motivation for this proposal is to increase efficiency of decision making related to the application of user data tracking within the ShapeShift app. Developing high-performing product features and marketing campaigns is a unique challenge in Web3, as there is a de facto expectation of data pseudonymity. In addition, the DAO is committed to offering a private version of our app that does not include any analytics or tracking. As a result, we are looking for creative ways to gather and synthesize the data necessary to determine answers to the key questions raised by Diggy in SCP-80\n\n\n\nA clear definition of privacy and subsequent delegation of related decision making to the Product and Marketing workstreams would improve our ability to develop data gathering strategies required to answer these questions. \n\nSpecification\n\nThe proposed working definition for privacy is as follows:\n\n“Data privacy” means the ability of a user to determine when, how, and to what extent their personal information is shared with others as well as how that data is correlated with other trackable/metricisable events inside and outside the application. \n\nAs mentioned above, ShapeShift currently maintains a private version of its app so users can opt out of data collection entirely. This option ensures the DAO offers a version of the product that guarantees complete data privacy一upholding the most extreme interpretation of “no tracking/no data collection”.\n\nImportantly, the definition of “data privacy” above will be used to create a framework for data privacy decisions related to users who login via app.shapeshift.com.\n\nData Tracking Details:\nData: Anonymized click-throughs and user journey\n\nThe previous proposal explicitly excluded sending hashes of users' public keys. This proposal seeks to update that to permit tracking of anonymized data for the purposes of product improvement.\n\nHashed wallet id\nHashed public keys\nAsset ids belonging to public keys\nTotal portfolio (wallet) fiat balances\nAccount balances, in fiat and crypto units\n\nBy hashing a user’s wallet id (a uniquely generated string) and associated public account ids (per chain), we will be able to derive insights and make better product decisions around user persona profiles and how different types of users are using the app.\n\nHashes are unique and not reversible - this does not enable us to deanonymize a user from hashed data back to public keys.\n\nPrivate keys, or encrypted or hashed versions, never have or will be tracked.\n\nWhen: user data is collected from the moment a user enters app.shapeshift.com and agrees/opts in to sharing anonymized user data. Mobile app users are tracked as part of the terms of service.\n\nNo personal identifiable information will ever be tracked. \n\nHow and to what extent:\nAnalytics will track anonymized click events within our app for the purpose of understanding user retention rates, which features our users adopt, identifying drop offs or potential issues in our user flows, and to generally understand how users navigate throughout our application. We may sometimes also use an analytics tool to run anonymous surveys or polls with our users, to help inform product decisions or gather feedback. In some cases it could also be used to identify the parts of the world our users are in and how they first entered the ShapeShift ecosystem. This information will be used to help us with SEO, user acquisition funnels and marketing strategy.\n\nOn-chain tracking will respect the pseudonymity of user wallets, and utilize analytics for critical business tasks such as building complete marketing funnels, feature planning, feature utilization and verifying partner revenue reporting. \n\nThe anonymized data collected via the ShapeShift app will be available through the analytics provider/s and analytic platform access will be granted to relevant workstream contributors and shared during calls or office hours with the community.\n\nShapeShift will: \n• Never have access to users private keys nor collect any personal information \n• Never collect a users IP address \n• Never sell user data \n• Never gate features for users that opt-out of sharing data\n\n\nBenefits\n\nDefining “privacy” and allowing Product and Marketing Workstreams to explore various data collection strategies will allow these Workstreams to further measure the success of our products leading to better feature engagement, higher user retention and finding the best product market fit. This definition will give parameters for workstreams to operate so that the core values of the DAO一such as privacy一can continue to be scrupulously upheld while giving workstreams the agency to operate effectively within those confines.\n\nUsers will continue to have the option to opt-in to sharing data or choose to proceed with the complete “Private” version that collects no data of any kind. \n\n\nDrawbacks\n\nGiving workstreams the agency to implement tracking within these confines means that the broader community will have less jurisdiction over the specific tools implemented by workstreams in the future to collect, synthesize, and aggregate data. As long as the strategy falls within the bounds set by this proposal, a workstream would have the authority to execute on it.\n",

      "content": "# Engineering Workstream Renewal, February - May 2023\n\n\n\n# Abstract / Overview\n\n\n\nThe ShapeShift DAO relies on the Engineering Workstream to maintain the open source code base, undertake core engineering work to enable new features, support integrations from the broader community, and to provide architectural oversight and technical leadership as we continue to execute the DAO's vision.\n\n\n\nThis proposal is to fund the Engineering Workstream's budget from February 1st, 2023 through May 31st, 2023 inclusive.\n\n\n\nThis proposal adopts SCP-92 Definition of Workstream Leader https://snapshot.org/#/shapeshiftdao.eth/proposal/0x3529a9ab550387d1eedf34d0ba26b5c80ed1c04a74a3c407d9b06a6ea90325ab\n\n\n\n# Motivation\n\n\n\n## Previous proposal\n\n\n\nThe Engineering workstream came in under budget of the previously approved proposal\n\n\n\n* Total labor, infrastructure, and overhead spend of ~$397,810 USDC against an approved $496,540 https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1W5l60lyEMio-bXMo0cscEHQOT6azcGfmc8lqGvFCBSM \n\n* Approximately 400,000 FOX spent on bounties against an approved dollar amount of $100,000.\n\n\n\nFloat of $27k USDC stables still in colony, and cumulative ~400,000 FOX in Colony/operations wallets.\n\n\n\n### Completed\n\n\n\n* Multi account support\n\n* Account caching and failure tolerance and major performance improvements\n\n* THORChain swaps integration\n\n* Integration of Idle finance\n\n* Sunset of `beta.shapeshift.com` and legacy mobile app\n\n* Sunset of `fox.shapeshift.com` with LPing and farming functionality now native in the app\n\n* Swapper v2 with 0% THORChain failures\n\n* Launch of new mobile app with assistance from Fox Foundation\n\n* Revamp of fiat ramp UX with new dedicated page\n\n* ETH/FOX Farming V5\n\n* Implementation of best rates for swap routing\n\n* DeFi/liquidity providing abstraction\n\n* EVM abstractions upstreamed into Blockbook\n\n* Eligible opportunity UI\n\n* Migration of infrastructure from Fox Foundation to DAO\n\n* Self hosted Cosmos and Avalanche nodes, removing reliance on Datahub and improving stability\n\n* Additional Turkish and Ukrainian language support\n\n\n\n### In Progress\n\n\n\n* Support of Osmosis bounty & integration\n\n* Wherever notifications (EPNS integration)\n\n* Optimism integration (eligible for ~$250k possible grant funding)\n\n\n\n### In QA\n\n\n\n* WalletConnect to dapps\n\n\n\n## Team\n\n\n\n* [0xdef1cafe](https://github.com/0xdef1cafe) - Workstream Leader & Senior Engineer\n\n* [0xApotheosis](https://github.com/0xApotheosis) - Senior Engineer\n\n* [gomes](https://github.com/gomesalexandre) - Senior Engineer\n\n* [kaladinlight](https://github.com/kaladinlight) - Senior Engineer\n\n\n\n## Mandate\n\n\n\nThis proposal seeks to have the Engineering Workstream be the sole maintainers with discretion over CODEOWNERS, permissions and administrative rights of the ShapeShift GitHub repository. The billing account shall be controlled by the Fox Foundation.\n\n\n\nThis is to ensure the DAO maintains a high standard of code quality, velocity, reduced regressions, and has a single core team acting as maintainers responsible for the codebase.\n\n\n\nThe Engineering Workstream will work with external contributors to ensure contributions can be made expeditiously while not compromising quality, patterns or stability.\n\n\n\n## Budget spreadsheet\n\n\n\nThe details below expand upon the budget spreadsheet https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vOpFwELxFk2vKBGa9GxiQEo3gDGDReJkZVKk3KvMSwE\n\n\n\n## Recurring costs\n\n\n\n### Labor\n\n\n\n* Any contributor reserves the right to take any portion of salary in FOX and locked varieties thereof.\n\n\n\n* The budget includes provision for two new open positions at a rate of up to $210,000 each, denominated in USDC.\n\n\n\n### Infrastructure\n\n\n\nThe Engineering Workstream pays a managed-services provider, TaxiStake, for infrastructure that powers the entire backend of the open source platform and mobile app.\n\n\n\nInfrastructure costs exceeded our forecasts in the previous budget cycle, due to multiple factors.\n\n\n\n* A migration of the development cluster from the Fox Foundation to under the DAO's control, via TaxiStake. The development cluster is necessary for addition of new nodes/chains, local and hosted development environments, upgrades, rolling out breaking changes with blue/green deployments etc. This is another progressive decentralization step, where the costs of the development cluster were hidden and previously absorbed by the Fox Foundation.\n\n* Addition of archival nodes to the infrastructure. Within this budget cycle, this will allow us to remove reliance on Etherscan for internal transaction data required for balance and transaction history, and Infura for archival node data.\n\n* Node snapshots of synced or syncing nodes - cloud storage costs are expensive.\n\n* Additional EVM chains, namely Optimism - EVM nodes are expensive by virtue of storage and data.\n\n\n\nThe following factors are expected to increase the infrastructure costs slightly during the next budget cycle:\n\n\n\n* the addition of more EVM chains, namely Binance Smart Chain and Polygon, requiring archival node syncs, and multiple snapshots, and data ingress.\n\n\n\nThe following factors are expected to decrease the infrastructure costs slightly during the next budget cycle:\n\n\n\n* Negotiated lower margin with TaxiStake. Previously a 50% markup was applied to the underlying infrastructure costs, this has been reduced to 30%.\n\n* Removal of EVM full nodes (Ethereum/Avalanche/Optimism), once archival nodes are fully synced.\n\n* Removal of outdated snapshot data for currently syncing nodes.\n\n* Migration of API layer from `eu-west-1` to `us-east-1`, reducing application layer costs by 50%, though this may not be worth the labor cost to enact.\n\n\n\nTaxiStake is currently forecasting a bottom line cost of $22,100 for February.\n\n\n\nThe numerous factors above make an accurate forecast difficult. Overall, we are expecting a slight net increase in costs, and are requesting $120,000 USDC for expected infrastructure costs, based on an expected maximum $30,000 for four months. Failure to cover these costs will lead to a 100% production outage.\n\n\n\n## Non-recurring costs\n\n\n\n### Bounty Program\n\n\n\nAs discussed and largely agreed within the community, the bounty program in its previous form had significant flaws. We are requesting $8,000/month worth of FOX, ~200,000 FOX at current prices, to provision for further experiments with tightly controlled scopes of work that are timely and aligned with the shared roadmap where possible. \n\n\n\n### Miscellaneous\n\n\n\nThe budget also contains a line item for $5,000 USDC of discretionary funds which may be used for travel, conferences, retreats etc, at engineering's discretion.\n\n\n\nThe line item above is provisional, and any unspent funds will be returned to the DAO.\n\n\n\nThis budget seeks approval for the commitment of $5,000 USDC and $32,000 worth of FOX for non-recurring costs.\n\n\n\n### Contingency\n\n\n\nUnforeseen costs will arise, and 10% of the USDC subtotal is requested accordingly.\n\n\n\nThe budget seeks approval for $52,800 for contingency to be spent judiciously at the workstream’s discretion, shall it be required.\n\n\n\n### Variance\n\n\n\nUnused funds from any budget category will be returned to the DAO at the end of the budget cycle.\n\n\n\nIn the event that the Engineering Workstream requires more funds, a separate governance proposal shall be raised.\n\n\n\n# Deliverables\n\n\n\n## Goals\n\n\n\nThe Engineering Workstream continues on in spirit from the previously approved proposal(s).\n\n\n\nThe workstream exists to execute on the shared DAO Roadmap Proposal SCP-121: Roadmap Proposal Jan - Mar 31, 2023  https://snapshot.org/#/shapeshiftdao.eth/proposal/0x5f7f4b731874f6b1d32405c0842223687c32625fb99064ab0a5bbc552563bed1\n\n\n\nThe DAO recognizes that the crypto ecosystem is rapidly evolving and liable to change quickly. The Engineering Workstream reserves the right to add, remove, or reprioritize goals from this list, with the intent to deliver the most valuable and relevant items expediently to the market.\n\n\n\nThe product roadmap, externally posted bounties, emerging partnerships, and changes in resourcing are all factors liable to change the scope or prioritization of listed goals, however, broadly speaking, we intend to complete the strategic goals that are currently defined.\n\n\n\n## Reporting\n\n\n\nThe Engineering Workstream will report progress against these goals via the following methods\n\n\n\n* availability via Discord, covering most time zones\n\n* weekly product/engineering public meetings\n\n* weekly governance calls\n\n* on demand for any specific deliverable\n\n\n\nShould the community request other reasonable forms of reporting they will be considered on their merits.\n\n\n\n## Benefits\n\n\n\nFundamentally, the DAO delivers a product to increase ease of use of the multi-chain multi-wallet multi-protocol universe that we find ourselves in. It is the Engineering effort that builds our product. We need Engineering in order to thrive. The goals listed above will be delivered.\n\n\n\n## Drawbacks\n\n\n\nEngineering labor is the most expensive component of the DAO's budget. Any aspect that does not seem appropriate to serve the greater needs of the DAO should be criticized.\n\n\n\n# Vote\n\n\n\nFOR: Fund the Engineering Workstream from February 1 2023 to May 31st 2023 for $580,800 USDC and $32,000 worth of FOX, with 0xdef1cafe as the Workstream Leader.\n\n\n\nAGAINST: Do not fund the Engineering Workstream beyond January 31st 2023.",

      "title": "[Ideation] Added fees for Thorchain swaps",
      "content": "Summary\n\nIf adopted, this proposal would enable the DAO to experiment with implementing fees on top of all Thorchain based swaps executed through the Shapeshift application. \n\nAbstract\n\nStarting Feb 15th, all Thorchain based trades would be charged a fee of 25bps\n\nMotivation\nSince inception, the DAO has pursued a singular vision and business model with respect to revenue generation. To date, there has been little to no data based evidence suggesting the sustainability of this approach given measured user growth and revenue per user. Therefore it is imperative that the DAO continue to experiment with alternate revenue models in an effort to find a path towards self sufficiency.  \n\nSpecification\nOver the next 12-18 months the DAO needs to iterate rapidly towards finding a sustainable business model. Assuming a customer value of .25$/month, and 250k/month of expenses, we require roughly 1,000,000 monthly active users to break even. Based on the most recent data from Pendo, we have approximately 17,000 monthly active users and are losing >%15 of users per month since our peak MAU of 21,000 monthly active users (11/13). We have two paths to pursue aggressively; increasing MAUs and increasing revenue per user. All reasonable experiments that align with either of these paths are worth the DAOs consideration.\n\nThe proposed experiment is meant to determine if users value our platform enough to pay marginally more for it than a completely free option when swapping assets via thorchain\n\nThorchain swap volume will be taken for the month of January as a baseline.  If within the first three months of adding fees to thorchain, monthly volume dips by more than 50% from the January baseline, fees will be disabled without any  additional governance action.  \n\nAll revenues generate from these fees would flow back into the general treasury for the DAO.  \n\nBenefits\n\nTrade volumes for thorswap were approximately 3.5M USD / month in November '22, this would potentially translate into 8750 USD / month in revenues.\n\nWhile this monthly amount may seem small, across all of our business models the Shapeshift DAO is betting on very large (> 15% MOM) user growth in all of its projections. Additionally, even this small amount would be our largest source of current monthly revenue.\n\nImplementing fees in a single product allows us to gather important data from our users in a lower risk setting than implementing fees across the entire product line. \n\nDrawbacks\nThere is the potential that our users are price sensitive and these additional fees cause us to lose existing users or fail to gain additional users. We can not run a true A/B test in this scenario and teasing apart effects of this treatment compared with broad market sentiment, product evolution and other user trends may be difficult, leading to inconclusive data. \n\nAs with most open source software, there is the potential for someone to fork the Shapeshift codebase and bypass the fees for personal or public use.\n\nMarketing and PR campaigns would need to be modified to ensure users are not being misguided by the original message of \"no added fees\". There would be a small engineering effort needed to augment the existing swapper UI to display the added fees clearly to users and add the transaction memo when interacting with thorswap. Additionally, the DAO would need a RUNE address that is capable of receiving the fees denominated in RUNE.",

The workstream additionally provides similar support and structure to the DAO, its ecosystem and networks.\n\nThrough Production Issue Procedure Best Practices, Triage and Bounty Management, Deployment and Regression Testing, and DAO Admin Procedures and Practices, the ShapeShift DAO Operations Workstream provides essential resources and tools for efficiency, organization, and overall product and services health that are vital to the success of the DAO, the product suite, it’s contributors, and $FOX token utility.\n\nMotivation\nRenewing this workstream will allow Operations to continue to work side by side with other workstreams to increase efficiency in individual procedural processes across the DAO and help progress deployment and testing processes while still verifying and maintaining reliability, health, and full functionality of all provided services. New practices developed to expedite efficiency through collaboration and administration of procedures over the last term include newly developed responsibilities such as: Marketing content reviews, RDP disclosure management, Partnership flow creation and maintenance, Gitbook documentation management, and full coverage of customer support, among others. \n\nThese procedures and collaborations allow the Engineering workstream to spend more time building and deploying; the Product workstream to spend more time scoping, designing, and implementing; the C-Mods more C-Mod time, etc… Funding this workstream empowers Operations to continue to complete the above stated goals through our continually developing practices, and organize and provide updates, resources, communication, coordination, documentation and any other needs that may arise from other workstreams, the DAO Community and its processes.\n\nThe Operations workstream is the only workstream focused on the wider picture of the product suite’s uptime, functionality, and overall health. It additionally mirrors that responsibility in the DAO Discord, Github, and Notion by synergizing and coordinating cross-stream collaboration further strengthening the DAO.\n\nSpecification\nThe Operations workstream Notion repo can be found here.\n\nOperations maintains: \nTriage tracker and Triage Report Tracker\nThe ShapeShift Dework Bounties Board, Trusted Community Dev timesheets, Bug Bounty Tracker\n2022 Prod Issues, Release Stats and testing fees, Regression Testing Schedule\nOps Review in the Content Production Roadmap\nOps Sprint, Governance Call, AllFox, Go/NoGos, Retros\nRDP program, Gitbook, Customer support in Discord\n\nThe Operations Workstream strives to keep the greater DAO agile and committed to maximizing efficiency, scalability, and transparency with a strategic lean into data-based decision making. At times, best practices and procedures may be challenged, modified, updated, changed, archived or revisited to maintain those objectives. (See: Unsolved User Problems, the governance tracker, POAP minting, daily regression testing, the evolution of goat/no goats, etc) \n\nThe renewal term length for this workstream and its contributors is 6 months, from February 1st 2023 to July 31st 2023.\n\nThis proposal continues @Tyler | ShapeShift as the workstream leader and @Tshifty, @Ron/PTT, @MBMaria, and @wesleygraves as Operations Assistants.\n\nBudget ask: $262,500 - 20.45% less than the last term \n\nMonthly USDC: $32,425 - 17.5% reduction from $39,275.00 last term.\nMonthly FOX: $11,325 - 28% reduction from $15,725.00 last term.\nMonthly total budget: $43,750.00 - 20.45% reduction from $55,000 last term.\n\n6 month USDC budget: $194,550\n6 month FOX budget: $67,950\n6 month Total budget: $262,500\n\nFull budget details\n\nA few changes have been made from the previous term in this next proposal with regards to staffing and budget reductions. As the bear market and DAO buidling march forward, the overall demand of Operational administration and testing requirements has evolved and reduced. Regression tests have gone from daily to a monthly rotation. Deployment test procedures have reduced the amount of time and contributors needed to efficiently respond to deployment testing requirements. The bounty program has been chilled until further strategic conversations can redirect it to a more successful and efficient workflow. Operations bases its focus on efficiency and in the spirit of optimization, it has archived and reduced cross workstream dependency on procedures and meetings like goat/no goats and Unsolved User Problems.\n\nAcross the board, these optimizations have pressed hard against the need for the complete staffing proposed and fulfilled in the previous term as months progressed and the DAO shrunk and refined. Even the inclusion of all customer support responsibilities did not move the needle away from the clear sign that the Operations workstream should not be exempt from the hard staffing decisions that had been made in every other workstream to this point. \n\nContributors @Neverwas, and @lych have both made quality contributions to the DAO over their tenure with the DAO Operations Workstream. They have been given 1 month severance, sent from Operations excess budget in Colony to help with this transition. Each contributor was informed of this decision in early January and was additionally paid for the rest of the month without expectation of any further responsibilities to the workstream. \n\nTyler and the current Operations Workstream are confident that the goals and responsibilities of the workstream can be proficiently maintained with a smaller and more focused team. \n\nThe budget for testing funds has been reduced $2,500 USDC this term to match testing requirements. \n\nTyler’s Workstream Leader salary has been adjusted from $12,500/month to 15,000/month and the % FOX has also been reduced in the WS leader salary from 40% to 15% this term.This adjustment aligns the WS leader salary with the lowest paid full time Product Workstream contributor passed in proposal [SCP-119] This workstream salary has not seen any changes or increase in the previous 14 months of service, while Tyler’s contributions and responsibilities have greatly increased. Tyler forwent any salary adjustments last term to assure the pay raises given to all other Operations contributors then. \n\nOperations accounted for 11% of the total monthly DAO spend in the last proposal. The DAO is lighter by a number of Workstreams this term so the potential % of the total DAO monthly spend for this term’s budget is 16%.\n\nIf network conditions or the price of FOX decreasing dramatically alters or changes Operations ability to perform required deployment and regression testing, an additional proposal addendum for test funds may be proposed. \n\n\nSpecific Goals and Success Metrics\nThe goals and success metrics for the Operations Workstream are listed below, split into current Goals and KPIs.\n\nCurrent Measurables:\n\nProduction Issue Best Practices\n\nGoals:\nTo minimize downtime of the entire product suite.\nTo resolve production environment bugs efficiently with minimal disruption to engineering processes, deployment cadences, or user experience.\n\nKPIs:\n99% uptime of the product suite and services: \nJuly: 99.66%\nAugust: 100%\nSeptember 96.6%\nOctober: 93.2%\nNovember: 99.8%\nDecember: 98.7%\nAverage 6 month uptime: 97.9%\n<8 Production Issue Escalations per Quarter - 6 Escalations in Q4, 2 Escalations in Q3 \n<50 Total Combined DAO Contributor hours dedicated to Production Issue Resolutions Per Quarter (Q3 - 24.5, Q4 - 23 hours)\n\nTriage Management\n\nGoals:\nTo discover, isolate, navigate, and manage resolutions of user facing issues in all ShapeShift products and services.\nTo provide known troubleshooting and mitigation steps for issue reporters and users during the discovery and recreation of triage tickets.\nTo mitigate and expedite time required from core contributors spent on bug tickets, issue reports, and production level emergencies.\nTo transfer correctly completed and accurate Github tickets of triage bugs to Engineering or Product to be posted for bounty.\n\nKPIs:\nGreater than 80% resolution rate goal: 66% resolution rate this year.  \n\nThis goal was not hit this term as many of the admining and oversight cycles spent on ticket flow management was refined to direct github ticket writing and the loss of the unsolved user problems ticket clean up workflow. This process will be updated and optimized this term as the workflow from support issues to ticket generation/monitoring are now all in one process. This KPI will be updated with the new flow and communicated accordingly in future AllFoxes. \n\nDeployment and Regression Testing\n\nGoals:\nTo catch 95% of prod issues during the deployment testing process.\nTo catch user facing issues in production environments in regression tests and #triage them accordingly.\nA deployment test is completed by the Operations Workstream during each release process and upon request in pre-deployment branch testing. \nSpecific regression tests are performed once a day by an Operations Workstream contributor to complete a full monthly regression testing schedule in accordance with regression testing best practices.\nOperations prioritize blocking bugs, supporting engineers, and efficiency in the processes already in place over chasing non-blocking bugs for a ‘perfected’ release.\n\nIn the 120 releases created in the newest iteration of the deployment testing process since September, 8 total prod issues were experienced with only 3 of them being caused by bugs that could have been caught in the deployment testing process. 3 bugs in 130 releases = 97.5% This does not include the releases from the earlier version of testing procedures. \n\nKPIs:\n<2 Cadences missed per quarter due to bugs overlooked in Ops Testing (0 cadence missed last term)\n<2 Rollbacks during releases per quarter due to bugs overlooked in Ops Testing (0 Rollbacks occurred last term)\n\nDAO Admin Procedures and Practices \n\nGoals:\nTo organize successful DAO meetings related to Goat/No Goat, Retros, Ops Sprints, and AllFoxes.\nTo track, organize, record, and optimize DAO repos keeping them current and relevant. To help in cross workstream collaboration projects that optimize efficiency and collaborative, transparent communication. \nTo provide assistance in projects that require support in generating procedures to be completed for the DAO or other workstreams. \n\nKPIs: \n72 hour max response time for all PR review requests from Marketing in the Content Production Roadmap.\nKeep All Workstream leaders and key contributors informed and involved in contributions to all Ops Sprints, Governance Calls, AllFoxes Slide decks, Go/No Gos, and Retros. \n\nThis goal was hit, however the process has matured and does not need the same level of focus in this next term.\n\nBenefits:\n\nIf this proposal passes, the DAO will continue to fund the Operations workstream budget to meet the deliverables and services outlined which are integral to the DAO’s success and current practices. Coverage for Prod Issue escalations, Triage Management, Regularly scheduled regression and deployment testing, Cross workstream alignment and stakeholder resources would all be focused, maintained and improved upon by the workstream.\n\nPassing this proposal will continue uninterrupted support and services offered from the Operations workstream to the DAO.\n\nDrawbacks:\n\nFunding this workstream costs the DAO stablecoins and FOX during the duration of the proposed term. This workstream would cost the DAO treasury potentially $262,500 over 6 months (~$43,750/month) if all funds are needed and exhausted in the budget.\n\nVote:\n\nFor: You support funding the Operations Workstream’s anticipated budget for 6 months, totaling a potential $262,500 to the DAO, and continuing the roles, responsibilities, and expectations outlined above in the Operations Workstream during that time. \n\nAgainst: You do not support continuing to fund the Operations Workstream.",

      "title": "[SCP-122] Proposal to renew Globalization Workstream (re-ideated)",
      "content": "Summary:\nAfter feedback from the community we decided to re-ideate this proposal with a new configuration, considering a 27% reduction compared to the previous term.\n\nWe should keep reducing the Workstream operations as runway projections progress. Check out the key changes following community feedback below:\n\n- For this term, there is no provision for adding new languages, given that the cost x investment is not justified. We will just keep the current stream of translations in small strings to keep our platform up to date and work to nurture communities with language support.\n- We want to use human resources as the main capital for Workstream to carry out its activities, always looking for a creative way with a lean budget. Roles of all those involved in the proposal and their duties are now described in the new re-incubation document.\n- We have reduced the cost of Office Funds as suggested by the community (half compared to the previous term). This generates significant savings compared to the previous proposal without the need for salary reductions (which are already below the market average)\n- We also redefine our goals with realistic yet challenging objectives aiming sustainability and balance in our team. These goals should be measured according to canonical tools that DAO provides and internal Workstream analysis.\n\nThe Globalization Workstream began its first independent term in August 2022. The SCP-95 proposal established a solid foundation for the organization when it comes to plurality, global expansion and brand presence in countries beyond the USA. Led by TheSmith and Co-Led by Vlad, SCP-95 also opened the doors to a range of creative activations with a lean budget and team. The WS is responsible for managing the ShapeShift DAO's interactions with the global community. This includes developing and maintaining relationships with key partners, managing outreach and communications initiatives, and coordinating the DAO's participation in global events. Globalization Workstream is also responsible for overseeing the growth of the ShapeShift platform in international markets, and for supporting the growth of the ShapeShift community around the world. Global contributors are mainly bilingual, but we do have trilingual contributors.\n\nThis proposal aims to renew Globalization Workstream from February 15th, 2023 to July 15th by accomplishing a 6-month term.\n\nAbstract:\nDuring the previous term, the Globalization Workstream positioned itself strategically taking into account research on the countries with the highest crypto adoption in 2022; According to Chainalysis last top global crypto adoption index emerging markets are dominating. Most of them are covered with community or language support provided by global ws: Brazil, Russia, Turkey, Argentina, Colombia, Ecuador, Ukraine.\nResearch: https://blog.chainalysis.com/reports/2022-global-crypto-adoption-index/\n\nCore goal for this proposal is to continue to work hard to consider SMART objectives aiming to accomplish Globalization goals.\n\nMotivation:\n\"We must create a kind of globalization that works for everyone... and not just for a few.\" - Nestor Kirchner\n\nBesides international communication, the current Workstream created legacy through community building, onboarding experiences with ShapeShift, legendary merch and even NFTs. Our community is excited to bring their knowledge and skills to build the future with us. They’ve already started to impact the DAO and we’re just getting started.\n\nGlobalization Workstream guidance aims to work strategically and understand non-US based users’ demands. According to Chainalysis research, the global top10 crypto adoption in 2022 is: 1 - Vietnam, 2- Philippines, 3- Ukraine, 4- India, 5- United States, 6- Pakistan, 7- Brazil, 8- Thailand, 9- Russia, 10- China. If we extend this list a little further, we should find other countries in the top20 covered by Globalization support like Turkey, Spanish countries like Argentina, Mexico.\n\nDAO is still looking for the ideal product fit and we shouldn't limit ourselves only to US markets, the Globalization Workstream has a set of goals that boost ShapeShift and its Workstreams bandwidth across countries of interest, mainly where crypto is blooming as stated. We must consider the exciting roadmap we have and also support the other Workstreams to reach their goals. Globalization can provide its workforce in almost all of the Organization's processes: it can help with general operations, bring new talents and also test product features in addition to amplifying the marketing bandwidth.\n\nSpecification\nOne of our main goals is to deliver 50k Global MAUs after the 6 month term measuring canonically with Pendo or any other tool that achieves similarity with Pendo.\n\nThis may seem like a challenging scenario (and it is) but we can achieve these results with creative solutions, bringing an aggressive position and earning new users. We also understand that the actions proposed in the ShapeShift DAO roadmap is a door opener for Globalization plans by expanding possibilities ensuring support for actions aimed at matching product fit and users. Thus, it’s also necessary to be assertive and engage these users in features that bring us revenue with relevant CLTV (customer lifetime value).\n\nFrom 4 to 5 events are on the coverage roadmap, most being global. Strengthening ties and establishing key relationships with our community is a goal that has already proven to be effective in bringing IRL leads to the organization. Event activations should target communities in Brazil , Spain (and Ibero region as well) and Latin/Central Americas aiming ShapeShift onboarding and MAU goals.\n\nNew languages shouldn’t be added in the new term but we will continue to carry out the maintenance of existing ones. We must focus Workstream’s demands on the Spanish and Portuguese communities using our current hired workforce and expand it to France. The Workstream will continue sharing reports with metrics and use of ShapeShift products by these developed communities.\n\nWe want a boost in WS revenue. A study on KeepKey feasibility in Brazil was designed to identify competitors and retail sales margin. Our objective is to carry out not only sales but also to guarantee a powerful merchandising, Globalization also can help DAO income with its own retail operation by splitting the revenue between Workstream internal activities (funding the Globalization team) and DAO's treasury.\n\nWe are approaching the Cosmos community, requests for Grants are in our plans. Thus, bringing independent revenue to the DAO treasury and Workstream as well.\n\nAll other services such as maintenance of translations (from the platform to organizational communications), our non-English social networks, incessant search for foreign partnerships, mediation of international affairs should be kept.\n\nGoals\nSo how can we boost monthly active users and support DAO's strategy - revenue income and product fit? Besides Pendo and other analytics tools that we are willing to use, here’s some tactics we envisioned:\n\n- By working around social media platforms such as Twitter, Instagram, and LinkedIn to promote the app and engage with potential users. This can include sharing updates, offering special promotions, and responding to user inquiries and comments.\n- Collaborate with influencers or industry leaders who have a large following and can help promote the app to our audience. This can include creating content that showcases the app’s features and benefits aiming for the perfect product fit.\n- Leverage content by creating educational and informative blog posts, videos, and other resources that demonstrate the value of the app. These can be shared on the app’s website and social media channels, as well as through partnerships with relevant industry publications or websites.\n- Apply for micro Grants that can fund part of Workstream's focused work on a certain topic of interest and also return income to the DAO treasury\n- We are considering running paid advertising campaigns targeting specific demographics or interests that align with the app. Mainly for Instagram/programmatic ads activation: this expense must be monitored monthly in order to assess the effectiveness.\n- Build ideas around incentives or rewards to users who refer their friends and colleagues to the app (Like FOX). This can encourage word-of-mouth.\n- Relevant integrations are yet to come, considering BSC and Polygon the most popular networks in countries like Brazil, there is an expectation to reinforce these features in Globalization plans. This goes for Arkeo, Thorchain and other partner products that can attract relevant user base and non-US MAUs.\n- Attend important industry events, such as conferences and regional meetings, to showcase the app and network with potential users. This can include speaking on panels, hosting a booth, or small sponsorships.\n- Support other Workstreams with our workforce in order to help them achieve their goals.\n\nDue to the organic users already acquired in social networks and Web3, we must also apply goals on these fronts. The organic growth of socials can certainly drive new users to the final destination, which is our product. New goals were defined for Global Socials:\n\nGlobal Socials are currently holding 5.000 subscribers. Workstream Goal is challenging and aims to reach at least 10.000 new subscribers in socials, this means growth hackers should accomplish 150%+ organic growth during a 6-month term.\n\nGiven the details of each Globalization frontline and their goals, see our SMART objectives bellow:\n\n- Deliver new 50k Global MAUs by July/2023 (6-month term)\n- Double Portuguese (1600 average -> 3.2k) and triple Spanish (1000 average -> 3k) Twitter subs over 6-month term\n- More than 5.000 new subscribers in Global Socials by the end of the term\nAccomplish translation maintenance ensuring weekly updates on time-based activities aiming 20+ updates\n- Open our community markets by integrating the right on/off-ramp solution i.e. PIX for Brazil, another Latin America popular payment method.\n- Foster KeepKey retail during 6 months aiming relevant growth\n- Attend to 4 strategic major events during the 6-month term\n\nAgile methods will be applied on internal team management with weekly sprints. Following both guidelines we can keep the lean budget with better accountability. It is important to mention that although many actions are seen as marketing, the Globalization Workstream feeds the community as a whole, having the Communication skill as its main bias.\n\nCosts\nWe request $32,2590.00 in USDC and $65,250.00 in FOX to cover all Globalization workstream expenses for 6 months, saving $41,850 USD and reducing 27% compared to the previous period.\n\nBudget summary:\nMontly USDC spent: $5,875\nMontly FOX spent in USD: $12,275\nTotal USDC spent for the entire term (6-months): $35,250\nProposal total: $108,900 ($35,250 USDC + $63,650 USD in FOX)\nTotal Office Budget (6-month): $11,400 USD\nDifference between past and new term: $41,850 USD\n\nBenefits\nBear markets can’t wipe out bull market adoption, while growth has become more sporadic with the onset of the latest bear market, global adoption remains well above the levels that preceded the 2020 bull market. By funding Globalization Workstream you will be ensuring that ShapeShift will continue to expand creatively with significant cost reduction, in addition to ensuring the international communications that are already carried out in the organization.\n\nThis proposal carries challenges that can directly and positively impact the DAO. Considering that we achieved these results in 6 months, we will probably reach the ideal Global setup and contribute directly to oxygenating the organization worldwide.\n\nFrom a financial point of view, that's one of the most economical Workstreams in the organization. It's requiring a budget equivalent to what a single regular DAO contributor would earn per year. We are aware of the current difficulties and market scenario, so that's why we are proposing a multidisciplinary team under a lean budget.\n\nDrawbacks\nThis proposal will cost DAO money, however we are requesting 70% of the total budget in $FOX (contributors also agree to take part in locked Hedgeys in order to reduce FOX selling pressure).\nThere is a possibility that some goals (like massive MAUs or social promotion) will not be accomplished due to market conditions.\n\nVote\nFOR: A vote “FOR ( I support Global WS)” indicates support for funding the Globalization Workstream from February 15th, 2023 to July 15th, 2023\nAGAINST: A vote “AGAINST (Don't fund Global WS)” indicates that you do not support funding the proposed Globalization Workstream\n",

This workstream is accountable for activities critical to the DAO’s ability to acquire and retain users and grow the ShapeShift DAO and FOX ecosystem's mindshare. This proposal continues to fund the Marketing Workstream’s anticipated budget from February 1 - August 1, 2023.\n\nMotivation\n\nContinuing to fund this workstream will ensure that the ShapeShift DAO can have a minimally viable marketing presence that the prior Marketing Workstream has developed and refined this past term.\n\nBy supporting the Marketing Workstream, the DAO can continue rolling out new features and be assured they won’t fall on deaf ears. Rather, new features will be rolled out to excited new users eager to experience the decentralized ecosystem that ShapeShift is curating.\n\nSpecification: \n\nThere were broad, unfocused goals in the original Marketing Workstream proposal and the proposals since SCP-75 (SCP-91). They were not created by observing historical data patterns or projections internally or across the industry, nor were they targeting appropriate metrics to measure our success as a marketing team. Here is a breakdown of those original goals (and pivoted goals) and our benchmarks against them:\n\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1GjNP37LN0Unnegw6YSFj08YxYgwlTIEjN3-Nr-w4ueo/edit?usp=sharing\n\nNow that we have a way to measure and quantify data and use that to drive direction and decisions in place, this proposal has identified high-level measurable goals and KPIs outlined.\n\nKPI’s and Activities\n\nSocial Media:\nTwitter Targets\nFollower count: 150k followers by the end of Q2 (~3.5k/mo; ~8.6% growth over 5 months; comparable to Erik V’s Twitter growth as well as other accounts that were identified by the community as highly effective accounts)\n\nPosting Cadence\n1-2 native content posts/day\n1-3 RTs/day\nMaintain engagement rate of 3-5%\n\nYouTube Targets\nSubscriber count: 7.5k by the end of Q2 (~650/mo)\nMaintain average watch time over 60%\n\nContent:\nPress Releases (maximum 1 PR per quarter, earning 200-300 pickups)\nNative blogs (2 product blogs quarterly)\nEmails (send at least one email per week, reach 20% open rate per email, increase CTR to an average of 1.5%-2%)\nMonthly Newsletters and Governance newsletters will be discontinued\n\nPartnerships:\nTHORchain (cross-workstream goal) \n\nSwaps: \nGood: Increase in-app trade volume by 35% by the end of Q1\nBetter: Increase in-app trade volume by 65% by the end of Q1\nBest: Increase in-app trade volume by 100% by the end of Q1\nSavers: 30% of vault TVL via our interface by six months after deployment.\n\nBy May 2023, we will source $15,000 from partnership sponsorship and co-marketing activities by curating opportunities for partners to further intertwine their brand with the ShapeShift platform via co-marketing in-person events and digital product promotion opportunities.\n\nNative Sites (parallelling Product Workstream’s proposals goals一important to note that marketing bandwidth has been cut in half; making these lofty goals):\n\nIncrease Monthly Active Users to 56,713 by the end of August 2023\nMarch Minimum MAUs 22,500\nAugust Minimum MAUs 27,000\nMarch optimistic MAUs 27,616\nAugust optimistic MAUs: 56,713\n\nIncrease our WAU/MAU stickiness metric to a minimum of 30%.\n\nIncrease ARPU (average revenue per user) from $0.25 to $0.35. \n\nThese three KPIs are intertwined as changes in MAU and ARPU are synergistic. The revenue graph goes nonlinear when both change simultaneously, so I believe it is critical that we focus on scaling users, ARPU, and basket size. The current ARPU is $0.20 (on the high side, depending on if we exclude whale activity). An increase of 25% would be a very significant movement of the needle (which is the lower bound of our goal). I think this number is meaningful in that it is a balance of realistic and ambitious in terms of our capacity to monetize and capture users with our existing product and marketing resources. \n\nActivities\n\nWe will continue to:\nSupport shapeshift.com and app.shapeshift.com through funnel design, metrics monitoring, copy support, and creating bespoke marketing materials and initiatives to support product launches and feature updates.\n\nDig into new revenue streams via partnerships and co-marketing initiatives \nRepresent the ShapeShift DAO’s product and partner suite by developing bespoke and creative marketing and messaging campaigns.\n\nMonitor user flows and identify areas of improvement to increase conversions alongside the product workstream.\n\nEnsure the marketing of prioritized features in a timely and relevant manner.\n\nCreate engaging content aligned with the brand of ShapeShift DAO while tying in relevant macro events.\n\nCommunicate ideas, create materials to educate current and future ShapeShift users, and spearhead creative design and strategy to develop and launch marketing campaigns while expanding the mindshare of ShapeShift to the broader Web3 space.\n\nAssist with grant opportunities as appropriate.\n\nBudget\n\nSince SCP 116’s recent re-adjustments of Marketing contributor's salaries and job descriptions due to the departure of Tyler as interim leader, there are some minor adjustments and optimizations to the budget from the amended proposal. View the changes here:\n\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1Pdkqb4o6Uju-ynIl2j8nn4smlM4QqDrDEywfK1CvAJU/edit?usp=sharing\n\nIf we extrapolate the monthly spend under Tyler to a 6-month spend, our “budget” for the last round of 6 months was: $246,600 (with $174,000 of that in USDC).\n\nOur new proposed budget for the next 6 months is $129,505 with only $91,320 being requested in USDC (a 47.4% decrease from the previously proposed proposal). The average monthly cost in USDC would be $15,220 (reduced from $28,810, a 47.2% reduction ), and the average cost in FOX would be $6,364 (reduced from $10,635; a 40.1% reduction).\n\nThere is one month of severance budgeted into this proposal for contributors from the past workstream in order to assist with their transition to new roles outside of the DAO.\n\nView the detailed budget here:\n\nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-lrysFysVDO1nkQZJs9YJH8dgCzfOrxpB_KMga41st8/edit?usp=sharing\n\nIf this proposal passes, this budget will be distributed in USDC and FOX as outlined above. The equivalent amount of USDC & FOX will be transferred from the DAO’s treasury to the Marketing Workstream on Colony monthly. All unused funds will be returned to the DAO or rolled over to the next budget cycle.\nThe marketing workstream will be in the position to sell promotional and sponsorship space on the different ShapeShift platforms or through marketing initiatives on behalf of ShapeShift through leveraging co-marketing initiatives. Any funds accumulated from those activations will be transparently accounted for and used to roll back into marketing spend. Additionally, the marketing workstream will be responsible for managing and allocating any grant funding received by the DAO that is earmarked for user-incentives, such as the in-progress grant application with Optimism.\n\nBenefits\n\nIf this proposal passes, the DAO will continue to receive basic marketing services:\n\n• The design and execution of bespoke limited marketing roadmaps and campaigns spanning most products of the DAO that drive user growth or revenue.\n\n• Maintain and accelerate growth and participation within the epicenter of crypto conversation in the “Crypto-Twitter-Sphere”.\n\n• Provide integrated partner marketing support and onboarding support for new and existing partners一potentially driving additional revenue to be used on marketing initiatives or given back to the DAO\n\n• Assistance with front-end copywriting, SEO optimization, and user flows.\n\n• Brand-focused written content一advocating through product-motivated messaging for the DAO’s bespoke products and values.\n\nDrawbacks\n\nThe main potential risk is whether the ShapeShift community believes that the KPI’s and marketing strategy outlined above and its associated costs + benefits will be worth it AND achievable in the 6-month timeline. There is an elephant in the room that is important to address regarding the prior volatility of the marketing workstream and its ability to deliver and communicate effectively across the DAO一especially with the reduction of staffing. As the Web3 industry grows, so do the competition and density of other platforms in the space. It is important that you can trust the skills and abilities this team has and independently evaluate whether you think it is the right blend for what the DAO needs right now. To mitigate exposure risk, only six months of funding are being requested. The funds will be managed on Colony and can be revoked by the DAO via another governance motion.\n\nVote\n\nFOR: A vote “FOR” indicates support for funding the Marketing Workstream and the anticipated budget for the next 6 months\n\nAGAINST: A vote “AGAINST” indicates that you do not support funding the proposed Marketing Workstream\n",

      "title": "[Ideation] Renewing the Operations Workstream for a 4th Term (February-July)",
      "content": "Summary\nThis proposal is for a continuation of budget funding for another 6 month term, February 1-July 31st, 2023 (Fourth Term) for the current Operations workstream that was established with continual renewal of the passings: [SCP-8], [SCP-59], and [SCP-94].\n\nAbstract\nThe Operations workstream is an integral part of the growth and development of healthy systems for reliably producing and maintaining the ShapeShift product suite and its uptime, responsiveness and feature functionality. The workstream additionally provides similar support and structure to the DAO, its ecosystem and networks.\n\nThrough Production Issue Procedure Best Practices, Triage and Bounty Management, Deployment and Regression Testing, and DAO Admin Procedures and Practices, the ShapeShift DAO Operations Workstream provides essential resources and tools for efficiency, organization, and overall product and services health that are vital to the success of the DAO, the product suite, it’s contributors, and $FOX token utility.\n\nMotivation\nRenewing this workstream will allow Operations to continue to work side by side with other workstreams to increase efficiency in individual procedural processes across the DAO and help progress deployment and testing processes while still verifying and maintaining reliability, health, and full functionality of all provided services. New practices developed to expedite efficiency through collaboration and administration of procedures over the last term include newly developed responsibilities such as: Marketing content reviews, RDP disclosure management, Partnership flow creation and maintenance, Gitbook documentation management, and full coverage of customer support, among others. \n\nThese procedures and collaborations allow the Engineering workstream to spend more time building and deploying; the Product workstream to spend more time scoping, designing, and implementing; the C-Mods more C-Mod time, etc… Funding this workstream empowers Operations to continue to complete the above stated goals through our continually developing practices, and organize and provide updates, resources, communication, coordination, documentation and any other needs that may arise from other workstreams, the DAO Community and its processes.\n\nThe Operations workstream is the only workstream focused on the wider picture of the product suite’s uptime, functionality, and overall health. It additionally mirrors that responsibility in the DAO Discord, Github, and Notion by synergizing and coordinating cross-stream collaboration further strengthening the DAO.\n\nSpecification\nThe Operations workstream Notion repo can be found here.\n\nOperations maintains: \nTriage tracker and Triage Report Tracker\nThe ShapeShift Dework Bounties Board, Trusted Community Dev timesheets, Bug Bounty Tracker\n2022 Prod Issues, Release Stats and testing fees, Regression Testing Schedule\nOps Review in the Content Production Roadmap\nOps Sprint, Governance Call, AllFox, Go/NoGos, Retros\nRDP program, Gitbook, Customer support in Discord\n\nThe Operations Workstream strives to keep the greater DAO agile and committed to maximizing efficiency, scalability, and transparency with a strategic lean into data-based decision making.  At times, best practices and procedures may be challenged, modified, updated, changed, archived or revisited to maintain those objectives. (See: Unsolved User Problems, the governance tracker, POAP minting, daily regression testing, the evolution of goat/no goats, etc) \n\nThe renewal term length for this workstream and its contributors is 6 months, from February 1st 2023 to July 31st 2023.\n\nThis proposal continues @Tyler | ShapeShift as the workstream leader and @Tshifty, @Ron/PTT, @MBMaria, and @wesleygraves as Operations Assistants.\n\nBudget ask: $262,500 - 20.45% less than the last term \n\nMonthly USDC: $32,425 - 17.5% reduction from $39,275.00 last term.\nMonthly FOX: $11,325 - 28% reduction from $15,725.00 last term.\nMonthly total budget: $43,750.00 - 20.45% reduction from $55,000 last term.\n\n6 month USDC budget: $194,550\n6 month FOX budget: $67,950\n6 month Total budget: $262,500\n\nFull budget details\n\nA few changes have been made from the previous term in this next proposal with regards to staffing and budget reductions.  As the bear market and DAO buidling march forward, the overall demand of Operational administration and testing requirements has evolved and reduced.  Regression tests have gone from daily to a monthly rotation. Deployment test procedures have reduced the amount of time and contributors needed to efficiently respond to deployment testing requirements. The bounty program has been chilled until further strategic conversations can redirect it to a more successful and efficient workflow. Operations bases its focus on efficiency and in the spirit of optimization, it has archived and reduced cross workstream dependency on procedures and meetings like goat/no goats and Unsolved User Problems.\n\nAcross the board, these optimizations have pressed hard against the need for the complete staffing proposed and fulfilled in the previous term as months progressed and the DAO shrunk and refined.  Even the inclusion of all customer support responsibilities did not move the needle away from the clear sign that the Operations workstream should not be exempt from the hard staffing decisions that had been made in every other workstream to this point. \n\nContributors @Neverwas, and @lych have both made quality contributions to the DAO over their tenure with the DAO Operations Workstream. They have been given 1 month severance, sent from Operations excess budget in Colony to help with this transition.  Each contributor was informed of this decision in early January and was additionally paid for the rest of the month without expectation of any further responsibilities to the workstream. \n\nTyler and the current Operations Workstream are confident that the goals and responsibilities of the workstream can be proficiently maintained with a smaller and more focused team. \n\nThe budget for testing funds has been reduced $2,500 USDC this term to match testing requirements. \n\nTyler’s Workstream Leader salary has been adjusted from $12,500/month to 15,000/month and the % FOX has also been reduced in the WS leader salary from 40% to 15% this term.This adjustment aligns the WS leader salary with the lowest paid full time Product Workstream contributor passed in proposal [SCP-119] This workstream salary has not seen any changes or increase in the previous 14 months of service, while Tyler’s contributions and responsibilities have greatly increased.  Tyler forwent any salary adjustments last term to assure the pay raises given to all other Operations contributors then. \n\nOperations accounted for 11% of the total monthly DAO spend in the last proposal.  The DAO is lighter by a number of Workstreams this term so the potential % of the total DAO monthly spend for this term’s budget is 16%.\n\nIf network conditions or the price of FOX decreasing dramatically alters or changes Operations ability to perform required deployment and regression testing, an additional proposal addendum for test funds may be proposed. \n\n\nSpecific Goals and Success Metrics\nThe goals and success metrics for the Operations Workstream are listed below, split into current Goals and KPIs.\n\nCurrent Measurables:\n\nProduction Issue Best Practices\n\nGoals:\nTo minimize downtime of the entire product suite.\nTo resolve production environment bugs efficiently with minimal disruption to engineering processes, deployment cadences, or user experience.\n\nKPIs:\n99% uptime of the product suite and services: \nJuly: 99.66%\nAugust: 100%\nSeptember 96.6%\nOctober: 93.2%\nNovember: 99.8%\nDecember: 98.7%\nAverage 6 month uptime: 97.9%\n<8 Production Issue Escalations per Quarter - 6 Escalations in Q4, 2 Escalations in Q3 \n<50 Total Combined DAO Contributor hours dedicated to Production Issue Resolutions Per Quarter (Q3 - 24.5, Q4 - 23 hours)\n\nTriage Management\n\nGoals:\nTo discover, isolate, navigate, and manage resolutions of user facing issues in all ShapeShift products and services.\nTo provide known troubleshooting and mitigation steps for issue reporters and users during the discovery and recreation of triage tickets.\nTo mitigate and expedite time required from core contributors spent on bug tickets, issue reports, and production level emergencies.\nTo transfer correctly completed and accurate Github tickets of triage bugs to Engineering or Product to be posted for bounty.\n\nKPIs:\nGreater than 80% resolution rate goal: 66% resolution rate this year.  \n\nThis goal was not hit this term as many of the admining and oversight cycles spent on ticket flow management was refined to direct github ticket writing and the loss of the unsolved user problems ticket clean up workflow.  This process will be updated and optimized this term as the workflow from support issues to ticket generation/monitoring are now all in one process.  This KPI will be updated with the new flow and communicated accordingly in future AllFoxes. \n\nDeployment and Regression Testing\n\nGoals:\nTo catch 95% of prod issues during the deployment testing process.\nTo catch user facing issues in production environments in regression tests and #triage them accordingly.\nA deployment test is completed by the Operations Workstream during each release process and upon request in pre-deployment branch testing. \nSpecific regression tests are performed once a day by an Operations Workstream contributor to complete a full monthly regression testing schedule in accordance with regression testing best practices.\nOperations prioritize blocking bugs, supporting engineers, and efficiency in the processes already in place over chasing non-blocking bugs for a ‘perfected’ release.\n\nIn the 120 releases created in the newest iteration of the deployment testing process since September, 8 total prod issues were experienced with only 3 of them being caused by bugs that could have been caught in the deployment testing process.  3 bugs in 130 releases = 97.5% This does not include the releases from the earlier version of testing procedures. \n\nKPIs:\n<2 Cadences missed per quarter due to bugs overlooked in Ops Testing (0 cadence missed last term)\n<2 Rollbacks during releases per quarter due to bugs overlooked in Ops Testing (0 Rollbacks occurred last term)\n\nDAO Admin Procedures and Practices \n\nGoals:\nTo organize successful DAO meetings related to Goat/No Goat, Retros, Ops Sprints, and AllFoxes.\nTo track, organize, record, and optimize DAO repos keeping them current and relevant.  To help in cross workstream collaboration projects that optimize efficiency and collaborative, transparent communication. \nTo provide assistance in projects that require support in generating procedures to be completed for the DAO or other workstreams. \n\nKPIs: \n72 hour max response time for all PR review requests from Marketing in the Content Production Roadmap.\nKeep All Workstream leaders and key contributors informed and involved in contributions to all Ops Sprints, Governance Calls, AllFoxes Slide decks, Go/No Gos, and Retros. \n\nThis goal was hit, however the process has matured and does not need the same level of focus in this next term.\n\nBenefits:\n\nIf this proposal passes, the DAO will continue to fund the Operations workstream budget to meet the deliverables and services outlined which are integral to the DAO’s success and current practices. Coverage for Prod Issue escalations, Triage Management, Regularly scheduled regression and deployment testing, Cross workstream alignment and stakeholder resources would all be focused, maintained and improved upon by the workstream.\n\nPassing this proposal will continue uninterrupted support and services offered from the Operations workstream to the DAO.\n\nDrawbacks:\n\nFunding this workstream costs the DAO stablecoins and FOX during the duration of the proposed term. This workstream would cost the DAO treasury potentially $262,500 over 6 months (~$43,750/month) if all funds are needed and exhausted in the budget.\n\nVote:\n\nFor: You support funding the Operations Workstream’s anticipated budget for 6 months, totaling a potential $262,500 to the DAO, and continuing the roles, responsibilities, and expectations outlined above in the Operations Workstream during that time. \n\nAgainst: You do not support continuing to fund the Operations Workstream.\n",

      "title": "SCP-124: Fund the Tokenomics Workstream in Q1/Q2 2023 and Re-elect Kent as its Leader",
      "content": "SUMMARY:\n\nThis proposal outlines the scope and budget for the next two quarters of the Tokenomics Workstream, from January 1st, 2023 through June 30th, 2023.\n\nFor additional context around this proposal and discussion of performance and goals, see the Ideation forum post (which exceeds the Snapshot character count), as well as the linked Related Discussions.\n\nIncubation Post: https://forum.shapeshift.com/thread/draft-proposal-fund-the-tokenomics-workstream-in-q1-q2-2023-and-re-elect-kent-as-its-leader-41836\n\nIdeation Post: https://forum.shapeshift.com/thread/ideation-scp-124-fund-the-tokenomics-workstream-in-q1-q2-2023-and-re-elect-kent-as-its-leader-41884\n\nRelated Discussions:\n\nhttps://forum.shapeshift.com/thread/random-questions-41908\n\nhttps://forum.shapeshift.com/thread/a-discussion-of-concerns-voiced-by-thekiloalpha-on-twitter-41951\n\nQ3/Q4 PERFORMANCE REVIEW:\n\nIn this section I’ll take a look at our primary goal from the prior proposal (Q3/Q4) and evaluate our performance. (See the ideation forum post for deeper discussion of goals).\n\nPrior goal #1: Preserve and extend our runway\n\nThe DAO currently has 10 months of runway, through October 2023: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tKUiYs2vCYMmFl8A7mAqBQWL4B2EvwMNqhoNz_sG97s/edit#gid=1195054952\n\nThis figure is similar to the runway that existed when the prior Tokenomics proposal was written in June 2022.\n\n(Note that the Ideation version of this proposal referred to 11 months, rather than 10 months, of runway. In the intervening week since it went live, new expenses related to infrastructure spending attributed to the Engineering Workstream have been brought to light. These expenses stem from infrastructure spending that the Fox Foundation was previously paying for, which will be borne by the DAO moving forward.)\n\nThe preservation of the runway is primarily due to two factors: ongoing diversification into stablecoins via bonds, and DAO-wide budget austerity. \n\nThe Olympus Pro program–and more recently the Bond Protocol program–have proven remarkably effective tools for diversification. The latter has also allowed the DAO to reduce its reliance on USDC (a more centralized stablecoin variant) by accumulating LUSD (a less centralized variant that is not subject to blacklisting risk). As shown by the ShapeShift Treasury DAOshboard, these initial efforts have been successful; 11% of the DAO’s stablecoin treasury is now denominated in LUSD.\n\nShapeShift Treasury DAOshboard: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1SmTXEd3ALGWGMpW54qRpvaoCzRw2BQKPXag5K5XS3K8/edit?usp=sharing\n\nDAO-wide budget reductions undertaken by Workstream leaders in the middle of 2022 have had a runway-preserving impact as well. Monthly spend has been slashed from over 550k/month to roughly 205K/month. Most recently, in Q4, both the FOX Chain and Customer Support Workstreams ceased taking funds from the DAO.\n\nAnother positive development was the resolution of the DAO’s TRIBE liquidity-as-a-service position. This contract held 15.3M FOX, and as FEI/TRIBE wound down operations, it was unclear what would happen to these tokens. Under a worst-case scenario, these tokens could be bought at a discount by a single party and then quickly unloaded on the open market. The potential “death spiral” created by a resulting lack of liquidity led to a tentative proposal by Tokenomics to shore up that Uniswap liquidity in the event such a disbursement happened.\n\nFortunately, that’s not how it played out. After a good amount of governance debate in the TRIBE community, it was decided to offer token redemptions on a pro-rata basis. In other words, TRIBE holders can redeem their tokens and receive a proportional amount of other ERC-20’s held in the project’s treasury–including FOX. This has led to a gradual distribution; now there are only 8.1M FOX remaining in the contract. While these redemptions arguably might add slight pressure to FOX, their gradual nature suggests that’s probably not the case. Additionally, it’s likely that some of these tokens will never be redeemed. In that case, the contract will act as a liquidity sink where an appreciable amount of FOX is effectively frozen.\n\nSo in terms of LaaS, the DAO lucked out! This could have been a much worse situation; the fate of 15.3M FOX was out of the DAO’s control. The lesson here is that, moving forward, ShapeShift should be extremely cautious about entering these types of arrangements. LaaS may have seemed less risky when it was entered in late-Q4 2021. However, as we’ve seen, risks can emerge when prior assumptions (like those about market conditions) fail to hold water.\n\nAnother positive factor emerged just as 2022 drew to a close: the full payoff of the DAO’s Rari Pool 7 loan. Debt service costs, which were previously a pernicious force working against the DAO’s finances, have now disappeared. Additionally, the 80M FOX that was held in the Pool 7 smart contract is now back in the DAO treasury. This also meant that 80M was “credited” back to the governance-authorized TDMC allocation. \n\nSo - the DAO has unequivocally preserved its runway, even as it paid off stubborn debt, and even slightly extended it. Extending the runway beyond 10-11 months proved to be unfeasible in the face of those debt service costs, and also factoring in the community’s hesitance to increase bond emissions. Whether the DAO should seek to expand its runway, or merely sustain it, (or even start to eat into the runway without additional accumulation efforts) is a broader strategic question that will need to be addressed in the coming weeks and months.\n\nIn terms of scenario planning, the runway base case (the first tab in the spreadsheet) continues to reflect the “worst-case,” whereby no additional stablecoin diversification is happening, and no revenue is offsetting expenses. In Q4, additional tabs were added, factoring in gross revenue, and the total value of the DAO’s treasury. (Similar modeling around ongoing stablecoin allocation will be added shortly, which can help the DAO assess its approach to extended bond offerings).\n\nPRIMARY GOAL FOR THE FIRST HALF OF 2023:\n\nContinue to focus the community on the goal of runway preservation\n\nIn the most recent proposal, I opined that “...the paramount, number-one goal of Tokenomics in Q3/Q4 is to help ensure that the DAO remains financially solvent for as long as possible.” This remains as true as ever. \n\nThe DAO has proven tools to accomplish this diversification, from Bond Protocol to the more-recently validated Arbor long-term bond offerings. Additionally, the planned Arkeo airdrops could provide added value to the ShapeShift treasury as this chain begins to accrue value. (“Could” is the operative word here, as this is very much an early-stage project.)\n\nAdditional budget austerity, of course, provides another way to extend the stablecoin runway. However, this appears to be a complete non-starter for Q1/Q2. The unanimous consensus among Workstream leaders (having queried them about this subject at the DAO retreat) is that while they are all operating efficiently and productively as smaller teams, further cuts would be highly detrimental. While selective and surgical cost-optimizations (for instance, in finding better pricing for software the DAO uses) might be beneficial, the shared feeling is that personnel reductions would likely cause more harm than good.\n\nOf course, further spending cuts would be an unavoidable choice if the DAO was running out of funds. Hence the importance of preserving that runway!\n\nWith respect to modeling various revenue scenarios and how they might impact the runway, the super-detailed User Projections & Revenue Projections spreadsheet maintained by PTT and other contributors should offer fertile ground for making non-worst-case projections.\n\nADDITIONAL GOALS\n\nContinue leading strategic discussions\n\nOne actionable takeaway from the DAO retreat was for myself to continue to facilitate strategic discussions. Our Strategy session was detailed, in-depth, nuanced, and brought forth several interesting ideas via a bear market SWOT Analysis. Alongside other Workstream leaders who volunteered to carry various aspects out of the retreat, I’m happy to own the strategic discussion piece moving forward. We need to stay focused on the high-level elements to ensure we’re on the right track, working on the right things, pursuing our mission, and avoiding the things that can distract us from our goals; a consistent focus on strategy will help make sure that’s the case.\n\nWhile it has implications beyond tokenomics, value accrual is another high-level strategy component that touches directly on what tokenomics is all about: more on this below.\n\nContinue to conduct and present research, with a focus on Ethereum scalability\n\nThe internal educational efforts of ShapeShift Labs have been well-received. The DAO in general doesn’t have many contributors focused on the technological trends and improvements that could make a big impact on our strategic direction. I’m happy to continue providing that insight as part of my broader strategic focus. 2023 is likely to be a pivotal year for Ethereum-based rollups, as the protocol itself is making an upgrade (proto-danksharding) that will make these scalability solutions cheaper to use. I’ll ensure that the community stays informed about these developments, and what they might mean for the DAO.\n\n\nBUDGET STUFF:\n\nWorkstream Leader Compensation\n\nThis proposal continues with the approach laid out in Q3/Q4 2022, whereby the Tokenomics Workstream Leader receives $14,000 worth of FOX each month. The reasons for doing so were spelled out in the prior proposal, and I’ll echo them here: \n\n“This will help to reduce our monthly stablecoin spend. Additionally, by going “Full FOX” I want to signal my own deeply-held belief that we’ll survive this bear market, find a lasting product-market fit, and wind up in a much stronger position than we currently are. It’s my sincere belief that WAGMI.”\n\nThat sincere belief has only been intensified by the past half-year. During that time period, the DAO has made massive strides in terms of sustainability and operational efficiency. Waste has been cut. The remaining core team of contributors is dedicated, passionate, works amazingly well together, and has the right skills and knowledge, IMHO, to help the community thrive. Meanwhile, important strides have also been made towards finding a lasting product/market fit.\n\nAs before, this proposal entails that these monthly salary payments would be made via Boosted FOX Hedgies, with a 12-month timelock. Per the Boosted FOX proposal, this option provides an extra 20% of FOX following the end of the timelock period. (In the unlikely event that there's a technical issue preventing Boosted FOX payments from being made, payment will default to regular, non-timelocked FOX.)\n\nOperating Budget: funding for bounties, audits, and other expenses\n\nIn Q3/Q4, the Tokenomics Workstream spent a total of 42,500 USDC–40,000 of which was spent on the Yieldies code bounty. Additionally, 1500 USDC was spent on adding contract-limit guardrails to Yieldies, and 1000 USDC was spent on code audits for Arbor and Hourglass. (Workstream finances and spending are visible in Colony).\n\nThe Workstream currently has 2,067 USDC. This proposal calls for a one-time transfer of 17,933 USDC which will provide a 20,000 USDC operating budget for the next half-year. These funds may be spent on additional code bounties and audits. Other possible uses include conference travel expenses for research or potential Tokenomics-related talks on behalf of the DAO, and ancillary costs around ETHDENVER (I’m a co-organizer) or other events where there may be an opportunity to further the Workstream’s goals and improve the DAO’s visibility.\n\nPOTENTIAL DRAWBACKS OF THIS PROPOSAL:\n\nImagine a ShapeShift DAO where there was only an unofficial, non-funded, Tokenomics Workstream. In this scenario, a lot of meaningful work would still get done; the TMDC would still function (its budget is not a subset of Tokenomics), and contributors could still find myriad ways to collaborate–all without needing to spend funds from the DAO treasury on Tokenomics functionality or leadership.\n\nWHAT THIS VOTE DOES:\n\n1.) Fund the Tokenomics Workstream with a monthly Workstream Leader salary of $14,000 worth of FOX (payable in 12-month-timelock, 20% Boosted FOX Hedgey) and a one-time distribution of 17,933 USDC (payable in February).\n\n2.)

      "title": "[Ideation] SCP 123: 2023 Marketing Workstream Renewal (February - August)",
      "content": "Summary:\n\nThis proposal continues the funding of the Marketing workstream from February 1, 2023 to August 1, 2023. The Marketing Workstream will continue to focus on the creation, implementation, and optimization of marketing and growth initiatives for the ShapeShift DAO. This workstream proposal includes the explicit designation of 3 full-time and 2 part-time contributors in the following manner with one unfilled part-time support role for multimedia creation:\n\nHpayne; Marketing Workstream Leader\nArina; Head of Product Marketing\nTwells; Social Media Manager & Video Communications Lead\n(Part-time) Sh0x; Graphic Design Coordinator\n(Part-time) Sapote; Marketing <> Global liaison & Streaming Services Coordinator\n(Part-time) TBD <> Content Specialist\n\nThe proposal will additionally fund the essential paid services and additional tools this workstream requires to effectively market the DAO and its associated product suite while being mindful of lean practices to preserve DAO runway. \nOur new proposed budget for the next 6 months is $236,670 with only $172,860 being requested in USDC (a 4.1% net decrease in ask). The average monthly cost in USDC would be $28,810, and the average cost in FOX would be $10,635.\n\nThese paid services and tools include: \nSprout Social (Service). The workstream uses this tool routinely to manage all social channels\nQwoted (Service). For acquiring brand-building opportunities allowing ShapeShift to comment and engage with media on current topics\nMonthly Press Releases (Service). Through EIN Presswire (paid from prior workstream for all of 2023) and PR Newswire (paid as needed, expected frequency 1-2x per month)\nDiscord Nitro (costs amortized over a 12-month period). Marketing contributors are expected to be stewards of the ShapeShift community. Nitro allows us to engage with minimal friction and maximum efficacy. \nDappback (Service). Continuing to develop a FOX reward and onboarding program for ShapeShift.\nOur marketing Bounty page (Bounty)\nOpportunity Fund (Service). This is to help secure timely partial funding for events or larger external marketing initiatives. Allowing the workstream to work more nimbly when pursuing opportunities一such as ETH Denver (SCP 109) or F3ST--helping us to be a first mover on discounts and limited-time marketing initiatives and provide support funding for events.\n\nAbstract\n\nAs a product- and community-centric DAO, the Marketing Workstream is vital to our visibility and continued growth as a community, economy, and platform. This workstream is accountable for a number of activities that are critical to the DAO’s ability to acquire and retain users, and grow the ShapeShift DAO and FOX ecosystem while maintaining and growing the DAO’s mindshare with crypto users. This proposal continues to fund the Marketing Workstream’s anticipated budget from February 1 - August 1, 2023.\n\nMotivation\n\nContinuing to fund this workstream will ensure that the ShapeShift DAO can retain the talent that the Marketing Workstream has developed and trained as we move into the next strategy phase post-migration.\n\nSince the implementation of analytics on app.shapeshift.com一as well as the revised tracking of external media platforms一we have seen steady growth in engagement, activation, and market penetration even through the down macro market conditions. The next 6 months are critical to nail from a marketing, partnerships, and branding perspective for ShapeShift and the steps the current team has taken this past term have set us up to succeed and take massive strides in the adoption of the ShapeShift ecosystem.\n\nBy supporting the Marketing Workstream, the DAO can continue rolling out new features and be assured they won’t fall on deaf ears. Rather, new features will be rolled out to excited new users eager to experience the decentralized ecosystem that ShapeShift is curating.\n\nSpecification\n\nIn the original Marketing Workstream proposal, as well as the proposals since SCP-75 (SCP-91), there were some broad, unfocused, and unclear goals. These were not created by observing historical data patterns and projections both internally and across the industry nor were they targeting appropriate metrics that were conducive to reflecting our direct success as a marketing team. Here is a breakdown of my interpretation of those original goals (and pivoted goals) and our benchmarks against them:\n\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1GjNP37LN0Unnegw6YSFj08YxYgwlTIEjN3-Nr-w4ueo/edit?usp=sharing\n\nNow that we have a way to measure and qualify data and use that to drive direction and decisions in place, this proposal has identified high-level measurable goals and KPI’s outlined.\n\nWe will accomplish the goals listed below as a workstream by:\n\nContinuing to market app features that drive user acquisition from competing ecosystems and DApps by placing ShapeShift in the larger crypto narrative as the premiere decentralized solution through supporting the narrative of self-custody and migration from CeFi\n\nHaving a focus on increasing consumer retention and engagement through improving the internal user loop experience of our app (increasing stickiness and encouraging additional feature use based via targeted CTA’s)\n\nExecuting on strategic branding and marketing partnerships to bring more value to the broader crypto community as well as ShapeShift DAO\n\nKPI’s and Activities\n\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1sXrb9XpybWzJsWTCI8uS7roD6Py1dSP63IXkZ3elkoM/edit\n\nActivities\n\nWe will continue to:\n\nSupport shapeshift.com and app.shapeshift.com through funnel design, metrics monitoring, and copy support in addition to creating bespoke marketing materials and initiatives to support product launches and feature updates.\n\nDig into new revenue streams via partnerships and co-marketing initiatives \n\nRepresent the ShapeShift DAO’s product and partner suite by developing bespoke and creative marketing and messaging campaigns.\n\nMonitor user flows and identify areas of improvement to increase conversions alongside the product workstream.\n\nEnsure the marketing of prioritized features in a timely and relevant manner.\n\nCreate engaging content that is aligned with the brand of ShapeShift DAO while tying in relevant macro events.\n\nCommunicate ideas and create materials to educate current and future ShapeShift users and spearhead creative design and strategy to develop and launch marketing campaigns while expanding the mindshare of ShapeShift to the broader Web3 space.\n\nBudget\n\nSince SCP 116’s recent re-adjustments of Marketing contributor's salaries and job descriptions due to the departure of Tyler as interim leader, there are some minor adjustments and optimizations to the budget from the amended proposal.\nHere are links to the contributor's current job descriptions. \n\nSee here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Pdkqb4o6Uju-ynIl2j8nn4smlM4QqDrDEywfK1CvAJU/edit?usp=sharing\n\nArina https://docs.google.com/document/d/10Z-IMe07CvzYF7ZEWYB1qKtggx77-qE58JLFxAuXM00/edit?usp=sharing\n\nTwells https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-BLnMli7Lr0hf-eo7GJ7BxDKOrCLshA3nfBbhzlpntk/edit?usp=sharing\n\nSh0x https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KosdwwWhmDNO9cudagCXuM16K_D-U0bU23ZgXoMFkpU/edit?usp=sharing\n\nSapote https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ddDWzwRcZRZjV83OPClukGcnkzVIVdBMsFoGCCTSi2c/edit?usp=sharing\n\nContent Specialist https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dd90h1eGfxGaRY9hzzBRSLaYyAYQbIwnZz4ci8z44_Y/edit\n\nWith the recent rebalancing of work that’s been occurring due to the settling of marketing after a year of leadership turbulence, we have realized the need for additional hands to assist with the creative lifts required to continue to produce timely, pertinent, and high-quality content.\n\nThe Marketing Workstream under this proposal currently consists of 5 members: 3 full-time and 2 part-time. In the event we bring another person onto the team to assist with content creation, the Marketing Workstream will consist of 6 members: 3 full-time and 3 part-time.\n\nRetro budgets were hard to pin down due to the pivots in our spending from our original proposal. If I extrapolate the monthly spend under Tyler to a 6-month spend, our “budget” for the last round of 6 months was: $246,600 (with $174,000 of that in USDC).\n\nOur new proposed budget for the next 6 months is $236,670 with only $172,860 being requested in USDC (a 4.1% decrease). All workstream members have agreed to continue taking portions of their salaries in FOX (ranging from 10%-50% with the average FOX-opt-in being 32% across the workstream一WOOHOO!). The average monthly cost in USDC would be $28,810, and the average cost in FOX would be $10,635.\n\nHere is the breakdown of stables and FOX allocation for this round:\n\n*This covers salaries, software, bounties, etc.\nView the detailed budget here:\n\nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1R5JIYRVbLuKH7pEePxrVwUVVnFXuczZokdKtiwN2khU/edit?usp=sharing\n\nIt is important to note that the line items for “Monthly Press Releases” as well as the “Opportunity Fund” are at the high end of what we estimate costs to be. We want to make sure we have funding available to jump on marketing opportunities in a timely manner. More likely than not, a large portion of the USDC and FOX requested for these two line items will stay in the Workstream balance by the end of this marketing term or be returned to the DAO.\n\nIf this proposal passes, this budget will be distributed in USDC and FOX as outlined above. The equivalent amount of USDC & FOX will be transferred from the DAO’s treasury to the Marketing Workstream on Colony monthly. All unused funds will be returned to the DAO or rolled over to the next budget cycle.\nDuring this proposed sprint, the marketing workstream will likely be in the position to sell promotional and sponsorship space on the different ShapeShift platforms or through marketing initiatives on behalf of ShapeShift through leveraging co-marketing initiatives. Any funds that are accumulated from those activations will be transparently accounted for and used to roll back into marketing spend to help stretch our ShapeShift marketing dollars. Additionally, all savings and cashflows will be reported at the end of the term and either rolled into the next marketing term or given back into the DAO treasury.\n\nBenefits\n\nIf this proposal passes, the DAO will continue to receive the following services which are integral to its success:\n\n• The design and execution of bespoke marketing roadmaps and campaigns spanning all products of the DAO including the ShapeShift Mobile app, web app, shapeshift.com, and any other products the ShapeShift DAO launches.\n• Feature specs for marketing rollouts including goals, success metrics, and acceptance criteria.\n• Provide integrated partner marketing support and marketing onboarding support for new partners.\n• Front-end copywriting and SEO optimization\n• Reporting on Marketing KPIs and feature success metrics (Analytics!).\n• Design-oriented and brand-focused creatives and written content一both advocating through thought leadership and product-motivated messaging for the DAO’s bespoke products and values.\n\nDrawbacks\n\nWith an attempt to really dig into the drawbacks here to spur healthy conversation and engagement in the governance process, the main potential risk is whether the ShapeShift community believes that the KPI’s and marketing strategy outlined above and its associated costs + benefits will be worth it AND achievable in the 6-month timeline. There is an elephant in the room that is important to address regarding the prior volatility of the marketing workstream and its ability to deliver and communicate effectively across the DAO. As the Web3 industry grows, so does the competition and density of other platforms in the space. It is important that you can trust the skills and abilities this team has and independently evaluate whether you think it is the right blend for what the DAO needs right now. To mitigate exposure risk, only 6 months of funding are being requested. The funds will be managed on Colony and can be revoked by the DAO via another governance motion.\n\nVote\n\nFOR: A vote “FOR” indicates support for funding the Marketing Workstream and the anticipated budget for the next 6 months\n\nFOR (with Revisions): A vote “FOR (with Revisions)” indicates that you support funding the Marketing Workstream and the anticipated budget for the next 6 months IF revisions (noted below) are applied\n\nAGAINST: A vote “AGAINST” indicates that you do not support funding the proposed Marketing Workstream\n\n",

      "content": "### [Ideation] SCP-122 - Proposal to renew the Globalization Workstream\n\nRead the re-incubation post: https://forum.shapeshift.com/thread/re-incubation-proposal-to-renew-the-globalization-workstream-41928\n\n**Summary:**\n\nAfter feedback from the community we decided to re-ideate this proposal with a new configuration, considering a 27% reduction compared to the previous term.\n\nWe should keep reducing the Workstream operations as runway projections progress. Check out the key changes following community feedback below:\n\n- For this term, there is no provision for adding new languages, given that the cost x investment is not justified. We will just keep the current stream of translations in small strings to keep our platform up to date.\n- We want to use human resources as the main capital for Workstream to carry out its activities, always looking for a creative way with a lean budget. Roles of all those involved in the proposal and their duties are now described in the new re-incubation document.\n- We have reduced the cost of Office Funds as required (half compared to the previous term). This generates significant savings compared to the previous proposal without the need for salary reductions (which are already below the market average)\n- We also redefine our goals with realistic yet challenging objectives aiming sustainability and balance in our team. These goals should be measured according to cannonical tools that DAO provides and internal Workstream analysis.\n\nThe Globalization Workstream began its first independent term in August 2022. The [SCP-95](https://snapshot.org/#/shapeshiftdao.eth/proposal/0x79bef80c175443bd0fcbabe96aeef8aefc0a67e5be4d74cf00c38f193fff2f7b) proposal established a solid foundation for the organization when it comes to plurality, global expansion and brand presence in countries beyond USA. Led by TheSmith and Co-Led by Vlad, SCP-95 also opened the doors to a range of creative activations with a lean budget and team. The WS is responsible for managing the ShapeShift DAO's interactions with the global community. This includes developing and maintaining relationships with key partners, managing outreach and communications initiatives, and coordinating the DAO's participation in global events. Globalization Workstream is also responsible for overseeing the growth of the ShapeShift platform in international markets, and for supporting the growth of the ShapeShift community around the world. Global contributors are mainly bilingual, but we do have trilingual contributors.\n\nThis proposal aims to renew Globalization Workstream  from February 15th, 2023 to July 15th by accomplish a 6-month term.\n\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nDuring the previous term, the Globalization Workstream positioned itself strategically taking into account research on the countries with the highest crypto adoption in 2022;\n\nAccording to Chainalysis last top global crypto adoption index emerging markets are dominating. Most part of them are covered with community or language support provided by global ws: Brazil, Russia, Turkey, Argentina, Colombia, Ecuador, Ukraine. \n\nResearch: https://blog.chainalysis.com/reports/2022-global-crypto-adoption-index/\n\nCore goal for this proposal is to continue to work hard consider SMART objectives aiming accomplish Globalization goals. \n\n**Motivation:**\n\nBesides the international communication, the current Workstream created legacy through community building, onboarding experiences with ShapeShift, legendary merch and even nfts. Our community is excited to bring their knowledge and skills to build the future with us. They’ve already started to impact the DAO and we’re just getting started.\n\n\nGlobalization Workstream guidance aims to work strategically and understand non-US based users’ demands. According to Chainalysis research, the global top10 crypto adoption in 2022 is: 1 - Vietnam, 2- Philippines, 3- Ukraine, 4- India, 5- United States, 6- Pakistan, 7- Brazil, 8- Thailand, 9- Russia, 10- China. If we extend this list a little further, we should find other countries in the top20 covered by Globalization support like Turkey, Spanish countries like Argentina.\n\nDAO is still looking for the ideal product fit and we shouldn't limit ourselves only to US markets, the Globalization Workstream has a set of goals that boost ShapeShift bandwith across countries of interest, mainly where crypto is blooming as stated. We must consider the exciting roadmap we have and also support the other Workstreams that look to the product and community.\n\n**Specification**\n\nOne of our main goals is deliver 50k Global MAUs after the 6 month term measuring canonically with Pendo.\n\nThis may seem like a challenging scenario (and it is) but we can achieve these results with creative solutions, bringing an aggressive posture and earn new users. We also understand that the actions proposed in the ShapeShift DAO roadmap is a door opener for Globalization plans by expanding possibilities ensuring support for actions aimed at matching product fit and users. Thus, it’s also necessary to be assertive and engage these users in features that bring us revenue with relevant CLTV (customer lifetime value).\n\nFrom 4 to 5 events are on the coverage roadmap, most being global. Strengthening ties and establishing key relationships with our community is a goal that has already proven to be effective in bringing IRL leads to the organization. Event activations should target communities in Brazil , Spain (and Ibero region as well) and Latin America aiming ShapeShift onboarding and MAU goals. \n\n\nNew languages shouldn’t be added in the new term but we will continue to carry out the maintenance of existing ones. We must focus Workstream’s demands on the Spanish and Portuguese communities using our current hired work force. The Workstream will continue sharing reports with metrics and use of ShapeShift products by these developed communities.\n\nWe want a boost in WS revenue. A study on KeepKey feasibility in Brazilian was designed to identify competitors and retail sales margin. Our objective is to carry out not only sales but also to guarantee a powerful merchandising, Globalization also can help DAO income with its own retail operation by spliting the revenue between Workstream internal activities (funding the own workgroup) and DAO's treasury.\n\nAll other services such as maintenance of translations (from the platform to organizational communications), our non-English social networks, incessant search for foreign partnerships, mediation of international affairs should be kept. In addition to making its services available to any Workstream that needs specialized Web 3.0 people.\n\n**Goals**\n\nSo how we can boost monthly active users and support DAO's strategy - revenue income and product fit? Besides Pendo and other analytics tools that we are willing to use, here’s some tactics we envisioned:\n\n- By working around social media platforms such as Twitter, Instagram, and LinkedIn to promote the app and engage with potential users. This can include sharing updates, offering special promotions, and responding to user inquiries and comments.\n\n- Collaborate with influencers or industry leaders who have a large following and can help promote the app to our audience. This can include create content that showcases the app’s features and benefits aiming the perfect product fit.\n\n- Leverage content by creating educational and informative blog posts, videos, and other resources that demonstrate the value of the app. These can be shared on the app’s website and social media channels, as well as through partnerships with relevant industry publications or websites.\n\n- Apply for micro Grants that can fund part of Workstream's focused work on a certain topic of interest and also return income to the DAO treasury \n\n- We are considering running paid advertising campaigns targeting specific demographics or interests that align with the app. Mainly for Instagram/programmatic ads activation: this expense must be monitored monthly in order to assess the effectiveness. \n\n- Build ideas around incentives or rewards to users who refer their friends and colleagues to the app (Like FOX). This can encourage word-of-mouth.\n\n- Relevant integrations are yet to come, considering BSC and Polygon the most popular networks in countries like Brazil, there is an expectation to reinforce these features in Globalization plans. This goes for Arkeo, Thorchain and other partner products that can attract relevant user base and non-US MAUs.\n\n- Attend to important industry events, such as conferences and regional meetings, to showcase the app and network with potential users. This can include speaking on panels, hosting a booth, or small sponsorships.\n\nDue to the organic users already acquired in social networks and Web3, we must also apply goals on these fronts. The organic growth of socials can certainly drive new users to the final destination, which is our product. Thus, we new goals were definied: \n\nGlobal Socials are currently holding 4.238 subscribers. Workstream Goal is challenging and aims 6.400 new subscribers in these socials, this means growth hackers should accomplish 150% organic in growth during 6-month term. \n\nGiven the details of each Globalization frontline and their goals, see below our SMART objectives:\n\n- Deliver 50k Global MAUs by July/2023 (6-month term)\n- Double Portuguese (1600 average -> 3.2k) and triple Spanish (600 average -> 1.8k) Twitter subs over 6-month term\n- 6.400 new subscribers in Global Socials by the end of the term\n- Accomplish translation maintenance ensuring weekly updates on time-based activities aiming 20+ updates\n- Open our community markets by integrating the right on/off-ramp solution i.e. PIX for Brazil, other Latin America popular payment method.\n- Foster KeepKey retail during 6 months aiming relevant growth\n- Attend to 4 strategic major events during the 6-month term\n\nAgile methods will be applied on internal team management with weekly sprints. Following both guidances we can keep the lean budget with a better accountability. It is important to mention that although many actions are seen as marketing, the Globalization Workstream feeds the community as a whole, having the Communication skill as its main bias.\n\n**Costs**\nWe request $32,2590.00 in USDC and $65,250.00 in FOX to cover all Globalization workstream expenses for 6 months, saving $41,850 USD and reducing 27% compared to the previous period.\n\nBudget summary:\n\nMontly USDC spent: $5,875\nMontly FOX spent in USD: $12,275\nTotal USDC spent for the entire term (6-months): $35,250\nProposal total: $108,900 ($35,250 USDC + $63,650 USD in FOX)\nTotal Office Budget (6-month): $11,400 USD\nDifference between past and new term: $41,850 USD\n\n**Benefits**\n\nBear markets can’t wipe out bull market adoption,  while growth has become more sporadic with the onset of the latest bear market, global adoption remains well above the levels that preceded the 2020 bull market. By funding Globalization Workstream you will be ensuring that ShapeShift will continue to expand creatively with significant cost reduction, in addition to ensuring the international communications that are already carried out in the organization.\n\nThis proposal carries challenges that can directly and positively impact the DAO. Considering that we achieved these results in 6 months, we will problably reach the ideal Global setup and contribute directly to oxygenating the organization worldwide. \n\n\nFrom a financial point of view, that's one of the most economical Workstreams in the organization. It's requiring a budget equivalent to what a single regular DAO contributor would earn per year. We are aware of the current difficulties and market scenario, so that's why we are proposing a multidisciplinary team under lean budget. \n\n**Drawbacks**\nThis proposal will cost DAO money, however we are requesting 70% of total budget in $FOX (with the possibility to lock them in Hedgeys).\nThere is a possibility that some goals (like massive MAUs or social promotion) will not be accomplished due to market conditions.\n\n**Vote**\nFOR: A vote “FOR ( I support Global WS)” indicates support for funding the Globalization Workstream from February 15th, 2023 to July 15th, 2023\n\nFOR (with changes): A vote “FOR (I support Global WS, but with changes)” indicates that you support funding the Globalization Workstream for the next 6 months IF revisions  are applied\n\nAGAINST: A vote “AGAINST (Don't fund Global WS)” indicates that you do not support funding the proposed Globalization Workstream\n\n",

      "title": "[Ideation] SCP-124: Fund the Tokenomics Workstream in Q1/Q2 2023 and Re-elect Kent as its Leader",
      "content": "SUMMARY:\n\nThis proposal outlines the scope and budget for the next two quarters of the Tokenomics Workstream, from January 1st, 2023 through June 30th, 2023.\n\n\nQ3/Q4 PERFORMANCE REVIEW:\n\nIn this section I’ll take a look at our stated goals from the prior proposal (Q3/Q4) and evaluate our performance.\n\nPrior goal #1: Preserve and extend our runway\n\nThe DAO currently has 11 months of runway, through November 2023. This figure is slightly more than the 10-11 months of runway that existed when the prior Tokenomics proposal was written in June 2022. \n\nThe preservation of the runway is primarily due to two factors: ongoing diversification into stablecoins via bonds, and DAO-wide budget austerity. \n\nThe Olympus Pro program–and more recently the Bond Protocol program–have proven remarkably effective tools for diversification. The latter has also allowed the DAO to reduce its reliance on USDC (a more centralized stablecoin variant) by accumulating LUSD (a less centralized variant that is not subject to blacklisting risk). These initial efforts have been successful; 11% of the DAO’s stablecoin treasury is now denominated in LUSD.\n\nDAO-wide budget reductions undertaken by Workstream leaders in the middle of 2022 have had a runway-preserving impact as well. Monthly spend has been slashed from over 550k/month to roughly 205K/month. Most recently, in Q4, both the FOX Chain and Customer Support Workstreams ceased taking funds from the DAO.\n\nAnother positive development was the resolution of the DAO’s TRIBE liquidity-as-a-service position. This contract held 15.3M FOX, and as FEI/TRIBE wound down operations, it was unclear what would happen to these tokens. Under a worst-case scenario, these tokens could be bought at a discount by a single party and then quickly unloaded on the open market. The potential “death spiral” created by a resulting lack of liquidity led to a tentative proposal by Tokenomics to shore up that Uniswap liquidity in the event such a disbursement happened.\n\nFortunately, that’s not how it played out. After a good amount of governance debate in the TRIBE community, it was decided to offer token redemptions on a pro-rata basis. In other words, TRIBE holders can redeem their tokens and receive a proportional amount of other ERC-20’s held in the project’s treasury–including FOX. This has led to a gradual distribution; now there are only 8.1M FOX remaining in the contract. While these redemptions arguably might add slight pressure to FOX, their gradual nature suggests that’s probably not the case. Additionally, it’s likely that some of these tokens will never be redeemed. In that case, the contract will act as a liquidity sink where an appreciable amount of FOX is effectively frozen.\n\nSo in terms of LaaS, the DAO lucked out! This could have been a much worse situation; the fate of 15.3M FOX was out of the DAO’s control. The lesson here is that, moving forward, ShapeShift should be extremely cautious about entering these types of arrangements. LaaS may have seemed less risky when it was entered in late-Q4 2021. However, as we’ve seen, risks can emerge when prior assumptions (like those about market conditions) fail to hold water.\n\nAnother positive factor emerged just as 2022 drew to a close: the full payoff of the DAO’s Rari Pool 7 loan. Debt service costs, which were previously a pernicious force working against the DAO’s finances, have now disappeared. Additionally, the 80M FOX that was held in the Pool 7 smart contract is now back in the DAO treasury. This also meant that 80M was “credited” back to the governance-authorized TDMC allocation. \n\nSo - the DAO has unequivocally preserved its runway, even as it paid off stubborn debt, and even slightly extended it. Extending the runway beyond 11 months proved to be unfeasible in the face of those debt service costs, and also factoring in the community’s hesitance to increase bond emissions. Whether the DAO should seek to expand its runway, or merely sustain it, (or even start to eat into the runway without additional accumulation efforts) is a broader strategic question that will need to be addressed in the coming weeks and months.\n\nIn terms of scenario planning, the runway base case (the first tab in the spreadsheet) continues to reflect the “worst-case,” whereby no additional stablecoin diversification is happening, and no revenue is offsetting expenses. In Q4, additional tabs were added, factoring in gross revenue, and the total value of the DAO’s treasury. (Similar modeling around ongoing stablecoin allocation will be added shortly, which can help the DAO assess its approach to extended bond offerings).\n\nPrior goal #2: Continue to increase awareness of the DAO.\n\nOpportunities to expand DAO awareness via articles, interviews, and other avenues were limited by a lack of resources in the (old) Marketing Workstream. In lieu of pursuing this goal, I focused more heavily on internal education via ShapeShift Labs, which is my fun little name for the Tokenomics Workstream’s research efforts.\n\nSpecifically, we had many sessions around the theme of Ethereum-based rollups. It’s my long-standing thesis that rollups will garner relatively more liquidity and transactions relative to “alt L1’s” as the industry moves out of the current bear market. This focus can inform product roadmap and prioritization discussions, as well as potentially help uncover new L2-based treasury management tools for the DAO.\n\nPrior goal #3: Build upon the existing DAOshboards\n\nOur DAOshboards remain best-in-class; the transparency of the DAO’s finances are second to none. (Thanks, as always, to Darwin for his stellar work on these).\n\nInitial research into visualization tools was discussed in Q3/Q4. However, in this budget-conscious environment these were not pursued. On the other hand, the Tokenomics Workstream worked directly with Credora–an institutional credit-rating platform–in an effort to meld the DAO’s dashboards into their more TradFi-oriented offering. These initial efforts could pave the way for the DAO to secure a credit worthiness rating, thus potentially improving its borrowing terms for future loans.\n\nTHE BIG PICTURE\n\nUpon taking on the role of Tokenomics Workstream Leader in December 2021, my number-one goal was to a.) the convince the DAO community that the treasury was woefully undiversified, and b.) help find ways to make that diversification happen. This sense of urgency continued in early-Q1 as FOX briefly topped $0.60. While many DAO contributors (and crypto people in general) were continuing in full degen mode, and perhaps in denial of the fact that we could be entering a bear market, I adopted a highly cautious market and macro view beginning in January/February. This resulted in a continued sense of urgency trying to impress upon the community the importance of stacking stables in the DAO’s treasury–and shortly thereafter, the importance of reducing the DAO’s monthly spend.\n\nFOX is currently near all-time lows and down more than 97% from its 2022 highs. The market has vindicated this cautious and conservative approach–one that should continue to serve us well moving forward into (what appears to be) another year of bear market pricing.\n\nOf course, not all efforts have proven successful. What’s gone wrong? Well, some of the DAO’s experiments with DeFi have arguably done more harm than good. The Rari Loans, for instance, resulted in total debt service costs exceeding $4 million. 80M FOX were locked in the Rari Pool 7 smart contract alone, exposing the DAO to substantial smart contract risk; we’re fortunate that the two FOX-related pools were never exploited like other Rari pools. \n\nOneFOX was a problem looking for a solution; its value proposition of each project having its own native stablecoin was never proven out. ICHI’s AngelVaults turned out to be a distraction and were costly to wind down; although arguably these would have performed better if the DAO hadn’t been issuing Olympus bonds during the same time period.\n\nWe should keep these lessons in mind moving forward. Simply holding crypto is a highly risky endeavor. The DAO should be extremely selective about the tools and projects it chooses to use, only moving forward after carefully vetting the project, team, and code, and considering the risks in the event FOX continues to trade lower (Bond Protocol and Arbor provide good examples of how this can be done successfully). \n\nMeanwhile, the temptation to take on high-interest debt or ape into DeFi projects with tenuous value propositions and/or poor risk/reward profiles should be avoided like the plague.\n\n\nPRIMARY GOAL FOR THE FIRST HALF OF 2023:\n\nRunway preservation\n\nIn the most recent proposal, I opined that “...the paramount, number-one goal of Tokenomics in Q3/Q4 is to help ensure that the DAO remains financially solvent for as long as possible.” This remains as true as ever. \n\nThe DAO has proven tools to accomplish this diversification, from Bond Protocol to the more-recently validated Arbor long-term bond offerings. Additionally, the planned Arkeo airdrops could provide added value to the ShapeShift treasury as this chain begins to accrue value. (“Could” is the operative word here, as this is very much an early-stage project.)\n\nAdditional budget austerity, of course, provides another way to extend the stablecoin runway. However, this appears to be a complete non-starter for Q1/Q2. The unanimous consensus among Workstream leaders (having queried them about this subject at the DAO retreat) is that while they are all operating efficiently and productively as smaller teams, further cuts would be highly detrimental. While selective and surgical cost-optimizations (for instance, in finding better pricing for software the DAO uses) might be beneficial, the shared feeling is that personnel reductions would likely cause more harm than good.\n\nOf course, further spending cuts would be an unavoidable choice if the DAO was running out of funds. Hence the importance of preserving that runway!\n\nWith respect to modeling various revenue scenarios and how they might impact the runway, the super-detailed User Projections & Revenue Projections spreadsheet maintained by PTT and other contributors should offer fertile ground for making non-worst-case projections.\n\n\nADDITIONAL GOALS\n\nContinue leading strategic discussions\n\nOne actionable takeaway from the DAO retreat was for myself to continue to facilitate strategic discussions. Our Strategy session was detailed, in-depth, nuanced, and brought forth several interesting ideas via a bear market SWOT Analysis. Alongside other Workstream leaders who volunteered to carry various aspects out of the retreat, I’m happy to own the strategic discussion piece moving forward. We need to stay focused on the high-level elements to ensure we’re on the right track, working on the right things, pursuing our mission, and avoiding the things that can distract us from our goals; a consistent focus on strategy will help make sure that’s the case.\n\nWhile it has implications beyond tokenomics, value accrual is another high-level strategy component that touches directly on what tokenomics is all about: more on this below.\n\nContinue to conduct and present research, with a focus on Ethereum scalability\n\nThe internal educational efforts of ShapeShift Labs have been well-received. The DAO in general doesn’t have many contributors focused on the technological trends and improvements that could make a big impact on our strategic direction. I’m happy to continue providing that insight as part of my broader strategic focus. 2023 is likely to be a pivotal year for Ethereum-based rollups, as the protocol itself is making an upgrade (proto-danksharding) that will make these scalability solutions cheaper to use. I’ll ensure that the community stays informed about these developments, and what they might mean for the DAO.\n\n\nBUDGET STUFF:\n\nWorkstream Leader Compensation\n\nThis proposal continues with the approach laid out in Q3/Q4 2022, whereby the Tokenomics Workstream Leader receives $14,000 worth of FOX each month. The reasons for doing so were spelled out in the prior proposal, and I’ll echo them here: \n\n“This will help to reduce our monthly stablecoin spend. Additionally, by going “Full FOX” I want to signal my own deeply-held belief that we’ll survive this bear market, find a lasting product-market fit, and wind up in a much stronger position than we currently are. It’s my sincere belief that WAGMI.”\n\nThat sincere belief has only been intensified by the past half-year. During that time period, the DAO has made massive strides in terms of sustainability and operational efficiency. Waste has been cut. The remaining core team of contributors is dedicated, passionate, works amazingly well together, and has the right skills and knowledge, IMHO, to help the community thrive. Meanwhile, important strides have also been made towards finding a lasting product/market fit.\n\nAs before, this proposal entails that these monthly salary payments would be made via Boosted FOX Hedgies, with a 12-month timelock. Per the Boosted FOX proposal, this option provides an extra 20% of FOX following the end of the timelock period. (In the unlikely event that there's a technical issue preventing Boosted FOX payments from being made, payment will default to regular, non-timelocked FOX.)\n\nOperating Budget: funding for bounties, audits, and other expenses\n\nIn Q3/Q4, the Tokenomics Workstream spent a total of 42,500 USDC–40,000 of which was spent on the Yieldies code bounty. Additionally, 1500 USDC was spent on adding contract-limit guardrails to Yieldies, and 1000 USDC was spent on code audits for Arbor and Hourglass. (Workstream finances and spending are visible in Colony).\n\nThe Workstream currently has 2,067 USDC. This proposal calls for a one-time transfer of 17,933 USDC which will provide a 20,000 USDC operating budget for the next half-year. These funds may be spent on additional code bounties and audits. Other possible uses include conference travel expenses for research or potential Tokenomics-related talks on behalf of the DAO, and ancillary costs around ETHDENVER (I’m a co-organizer) or other events where there may be an opportunity to further the Work",

      "title": "SCP-121: Roadmap Proposal Jan - Mar 31, 2023",
      "content": "Summary\nThis is a proposal for Phase 1 of the roadmap for the ShapeShift DAO as reviewed, debated and discussed over several community calls and at the DAO WOW. This Phase is through March 31, 2023. (Another proposal for Phase 2, will be brought forward ahead of the completion of Phase 1.) This roadmap includes plans to add new features and additional chains to the ShapeShift platform.\n\nRight now there exists a large void in the industry, for users who already use Ethereum (or other EVMs) and Cosmos zones. Integrating both EVM chains and Cosmos zones to our app puts ShapeShift in a unique position to attract users by being the best place to view and interact with Multiple chains including EVM and Cosmos Zones; and view their defi positions across them all.\n\nThe objective with the proposed roadmap is for ShapeShift to become the easy-to-use, decentralized platform that gives users a single place to view their portfolio and DeFi positions while earning yield, swapping, and bridging assets seamlessly between EVMs, UTXO-chains, and Cosmos zones.\n\nNote: The results of the Phase 1 features & integrations will help inform the strategy for Phase 2.\n\nAbstract\nA link to the roadmap for Phase 1 can be found here: https://shapeshift.notion.site/d6e396d4e89d4264b936c2165f0f5dd1?v=0b95572137754700b9326ae6a1631cf5\n\nWrap up the Osmosis bounty: Get Osmo staking and Osmo / ATOM LP over the finish line. The core engineering team has volunteered to allocate their resources to wrap up the loose ends on the Osmosis bounty and get it shipped by mid-January. This includes Native wallet and Keplr support. PastaGhost is planning to wrap up KeepKey support as well, and once that’s ready, it should be shipped around the same time.\n\nSavers Vaults:\nGive users a simple way to earn great yields on popular, native assets such as bitcoin. The savers vaults are single-sided, and super simple to deposit into and withdraw from without any wrapping. The decentralized ethos of THORChain truly aligns with the ShapeShift vision, and users will be able to benefit from these returns without any KYC.\n\nYearn Revamp:\nThe original Yearn integration was completed very early on in the DAO formation. This line item is just to document that the integration will be updated to utilize the newer abstraction that the core engineering team built which will reduce the maintenance burden going forward.\n\nAdd 3 new EVMs; Optimism, Polygon and BSC:\n\nOptimism: one of the leading layer 2 scaling solutions. It’s powered by a technology called Optimistic rollups which bundle large amounts of transaction data into digestible batches. As of this writing, there are at least 88 protocols on Optimism with $552 million in TVL value locked in their smart contracts collectively. Aave and Uniswap are two of the most popular protocols on the chain. YTD Optimism has seen 1,764,650 new wallets spin up with active transactions even in this bear market.\n\nPolygon:\nPolygon currently has $1.07 billion TVL, across 310 protocols and YTD has seen 66,018,560 new wallets spin up with active transactions. Aave, Balancer and Uniswap are some of the top protocols on Polygon. Polygon has the potential to handle up to 65,000 transactions per second, whereas Ethereum can process only up to roughly 17 transactions per second. And, like other EVMs, Polygon fees to users are mere pennies.\n\nBinance Smart Chain:\nBinance Smart Chain is one of the world's fastest blockchains. BSC is well known for its lightning-fast transactions; on BSC the blocks are made every 3 seconds. It is the 2nd dominant blockchain as far as user-activity is concerned, behind Ethereum. According to DefiLlama current TVL on BSC is $6.62 billion. So far this year, BSC has seen 97,417,942 new wallets spin up with active transactions so far this year, impressive growth even in the bear market.\n\nNote: we are also pursuing Grant opportunities from these integrations.\n\nSunset Portis Wallet: The Portis wallet is most likely being sunset. We are waiting on the finak details of this and once we know more, will need to remove it from ShapeShift, and plan to give users a migration path to migrate to a ShapeShift native wallet.\n\nSwapper 3.0: As we now aggregate multiple DEX’s and plan to add a couple more, engineering has been working on the logic for “best rate”. We plan to update the UI on the swapper to display the rates to the user, with a “best rate” pre-selected, but the user will be able to choose which DEX their trade is routed through.\n\nWallet Connect V1 Dapps: ShapeShift is expanding the amount of protocols users can interact with through WalletConnect. With the WalletConnect integration on app.shapeshift.com, users will be able to connect to over 450 dapps and confirm transactions with their connected wallet in ShapeShift’s interface. This feature is almost complete, but there are some technical pieces being wrapped up. The plan is to launch early in January.\n\nWherever: This is a tool that allows users to opt into notifications via ShapeShift and optionally via email, Discord and Telegram. Users will get notifications for things like new feature announcements, governance alerts, and notifications when they receive assets. Wherever is built on the Push protocol, a web3 communication network, enabling cross-chain notifications and messaging for dapps, wallets, and services; in addition to notifications from ShapeShift’s Push channel, the Wherever integration will enable users to see all of their Push notifications on ShapeShift.\n\nCosmos Staking Revamp: Similar to the Yearn integration; the original staking integration was completed very early on in the DAO formation. This line item is just to document that the integration will be updated to utilize the newer abstraction that the core engineering team built which will reduce the maintenance burden going forward.\n\nKill the splash screen: to improve the bounce rate on the ShapeShift web app, we plan to remove the splash screen and drop users directly into a Welcome page on the app itself.\n\nTrade settings (slippage): This feature on the trade widget will allow users to change their trade settings so that they can control the slippage tolerance\n\nIntegrate 1inch & LiFi to swapper: Both 1inch and LiFi are DEX aggregators with rev share agreements available. Integrating both of these will allow the user to get the best rate across any DEX and provide another source of revenue for the DAO. Lifi also offers bridging, which will be part of the bridging integration.\n\nDisplay NFTs: With the work being done in blackbook, we will soon be able to have NFT support for Native wallet and all of the wallets that support ETH.\n\nMetamask Snaps: The majority of the work for the snaps is done. We’re just waiting on the results from the audit. The MetaMask Snap allows Metamask users to buy, trade, send and receive assets across multiple chains while using ShapeShift. This functionality is not currently available via Metamask, and will give their 20M+ active users access to chains beyond EVMs such as bitcoin, cosmos, thorchain, and doge.\n\nWallet Connect Update to V2: This will open WalletConnect support to chains beyond Ethereum. This is also something we need to do to continue to support Wallet Connect in the app because V1 is planned to be sunsetted in H1 2023.\n\nBridging: With so many chains supported, it's important that our users will be able to trade and bridge easily between them. We’re currently planning to integrate Squid and LiFi to support bridging between both EVM chains and cosmos zones.\n\nDisplay Cross-Chain Defi Positions: This will show users all their DeFi positions across all the supported chains when they connect their wallet.\n\nMotivation\nThis lays out a strategic plan for the development of the product over the first 3 months of 2023. Through community discussions, research, and time-phased projections, together we’ve identified this strategy for the next few months that will give ShapeShift a unique position for which to attract a larger user base. This strategy also aligns with the broader DAO vision.\n\nDrawbacks\nThere are a lot of projections being made based on the research we’ve done to support this strategy. Given that it’s a bear market and conditions could even get worse, there’s a chance that a different strategy would be better for the DAO and that we’re not going to see the growth that we’re forecasting.\n\nVote\nFor: a vote for this means you support the priorities laid out in this roadmap for Phase 1\nAgainst: a vote means you do not support this roadmap or support a different priority of work.",

Future platforms that the community chooses to implement may also be included. This workstream is used daily to ensure the smooth operation of the ShapeShift DAO.\nThis proposal is to renew the Moderation Workstream, re-elect Giantkin as leader and fund the workstream through the end of June 2023.\nTotal Ask is $11600/m\n\nCharter\nNo other Proposals past/future are to affect this proposal.\nDuring the proposal run, if at any time Moderation lead needs to leave (or be asked to leave)\nthe Leaders group can force vote out the Moderation lead (or put leader on hold). No other method.\n\nTemp position given to other mod members, number 2 first would be put in ‘charge’ until lead returns, or a new lead is voted in.\n-Hiring/firing is solely based on the Moderation leads decision. Based on discussions, Total amount for proposal will be listed, without breakdown, in proposal.\n\nAbstract\nModeration supports all workstreams and all users within each of the platforms it moderates. As we bring more members into the various platforms, moderators act as so much more than bot managers and spam blockers. Not only do the moderators set up the verification process, they are the point of contact for members having issues with the verification process. They function as the greeters of the DAO, if you will. Our team of moderators clears the path for new members, new contributors and new supporters by facilitating a fluid user experience. Enthusiastic about all things defi and crypto, empowering community members, new and old alike, on their journey to self-empowered entrepreneurism.\n\nMotivation\nThe mission of this workstream is simple: to help people. Moderation is the workstream you never knew you needed, but couldn’t live without. From welcoming new users to setting up Zoom calls to managing bots. Moderation is here to support the community. This workstream strives to create a space that fosters security, growth and innovation.\nOur team of trustworthy, confident and enthusiastic moderators allows for decentralization of community moderation. This may address the point of preventing accusations of vested interest, since only community elected mods have the power to preserve and maintain the DAO culture.\nAs the workstream leader, I want to make the user feel like they are able to relax. Users are most likely talking from their home space, home usually means they feel safe. I want to keep that feeling in our group.\n\nSpecification\nModerators take on wide variety of tasks, including but not limited to:\n\n*Organize user flow via roles, channels and bots\n*Create and maintain scheduled events in sesh & Discord\n*Provide protection from scammers\n*Warn abusers (strike system established by Giantkin)\n*Issue Bans based on abuse (temp/forever bans)\n*Providing Discord support\n*Facilitating ‘temps’ for a job, for example, providing the DJ with a role for the event\n*Help maintain and update server images such as avatars, stickers, emojis, etc. (graymachine)\n*Provide moderation support (live when possible) for meetings and community events\n*Drive users to the proper channels\n*Continually monitoring channels, and other server banlists for potential spam/scammers and adding them into our banlist\n*Taking part in Support/Ops triage process by shuttling members requesting support to the proper channels, connecting with self help resources, #support, Zendesk, etc as appropriate\n*Appropriate use of Admin Power by Moderation Workstream Leader\n**Moving Donova from Marketing to Moderation transition for Telegram basic moderation/some repost duties.\n\nWhat are the goals of this workstream?\n\n*Provide 12 hour moderation coverage to ShapeShift DAO’s community channels, with the eventual desired goal to provide 24 hour coverage if needed.\n*Proactively ban 90% of scammers/bots that try to sneak into ShapeShift discord\n*Ensure that most community meetings are scheduled on the calendar\n**The Moderation Workstream is successful when you don’t notice that it’s there.**\n*Enforce the Code Of Conduct as recently updated, to the best of ability.\n\nDuring the Jan - June 2022 term, the Moderation Workstream has accomplished the following:\n\n*Stopped 34 raids (as of the last Allfox in October) (rough handcount)\n*Setup a new user flow for Languages\n*Sustainability updates to server roles and channels\n*Updates to Role Selector\n*Changed Captcha Bots to one that has language options\n\nBenefits\n\n*Keeps the discord clear of spammers\n*Limits the Scammers on server\n\nDrawbacks\n\nGrowing member list, growing expense.\nPower Risk",

      "title": "SCP-120: Claim and delegate SAFE Airdrop",
      "content": "## Summary\nThe purpose of this proposal is to claim and delegate the SAFE Tokens rewarded to the DAO Treasury before the deadline of December 27th, 2022 at 2am MST.\n\n## Abstract\nAs a Gnosis Safe, ShapeShift DAO’s Treasury is eligible to claim 11,251.1 SAFE tokens from the SAFE airdrop. Currently the DAO is eligible to claim 5,924.51 SAFE, with the remaining 5,326.58 SAFE vesting linearly until September 28th, 2026. If the DAO does not claim some amount of its unlocked SAFE prior to the December 27th deadline, its allocation will be transferred back to the SafeDAO Treasury. In order to claim, the DAO must select an address to delegate our SAFE voting power to that cannot be the DAO treasury. I am proposing that we delegate to Auryn Macmillan (aka Auryn.eth on [twitter](https://twitter.com/auryn_macmillan) and [etherscan](https://etherscan.io/address/0xd714dd60e22bbb1cbafd0e40de5cfa7bbdd3f3c8)) , an active member of the Ethereum ecosystem, and long-time contributor to Gnosis, Safe, and Gnosis Guild.\n\nIf anyone is interested in going through the claiming flow and learning more about SAFE Token and the registered delegates, you can go through the claiming process as the DAO treasury [here](https://app.safe.global/eth:0x90A48D5CF7343B08dA12E067680B4C6dbfE551Be/apps?appUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fapps.gnosis-safe.io%2Fsafe-claiming-app).\n\n## Motivation\nThe only cost to claim the airdrop is a small amount of gas required to execute the transactions. While SAFE is not yet transferable, it’s likely that the community will vote to enable transferability in the near future, which will likely give SAFE a monetary value. Claiming this airdrop helps to grow and diversify ShapeShift’s treasury while also supporting decentralized governance of the Safe protocol, which the DAO depends on to power its Treasury.\n \n## Specification \nIf this proposal passes, the transactions to claim the vested portion of the airdrop and delegate voting power to Auryn.eth will be executed prior to the December 27th deadline. Additionally, passing this proposal will delegate authority to the Treasury Management and Diversification Committee to manage both vested and unvested SAFE tokens going forward.\n\n## Benefits\nThe primary benefits are treasury diversification and growth as well as supporting the decentralized governance of the Safe Protocol.\n\n## Drawbacks\nThere is inherent risk when interacting with any smart contract. However, the Safe token as well as the airdrop and vesting contracts have all been [audited](https://github.com/safe-global/safe-token#audits), and multiple DAOs with large treasuries have already claimed without issue.\n\nThe transactions to claim the airdrop are included with this proposal, and a simulation of the included transactions can be found here: https://dashboard.tenderly.co/public/safe/safe-apps/simulator/25fc5f69-13fa-468b-a0b2-9c57fa4a94ee",

      "content": "incubation link - https://forum.shapeshift.com/thread/scp-tbd-deposit-3500-of-mps-usdc-liquidity-to-increase-rev-share-41480\nIdeation link - https://snapshot.org/#/shapeshiftdao.eth/proposal/0x38e7da990180f22f7c2fcf7fb7c866ed7788c547fb0a58188bbe373c73dfa1ea\n\nSummary: Deposit $3500 of liquidity into the Mt. Pelerin Liquidity pool in order to earn an extra 35% of revenue on each purchase through Mt. Pelerin On-Ramp.\n\nAbstract: This would allow for the DAO to earn from the current 15% of all fees on purchases through Mt. Pelerin to 50%. The focus on the DAO currently increasing MAU which should ultimately drive more revenues through using features like onramps like Mt. Pelerin. We tried to get the 50% rev share without the staking of $3500 worth of MPS/USDC, but were ultimately declined but were told we could get the same boost if we deposited into the pool.\n\nLink to the Referral Program - https://www.mtpelerin.com/invite?utm_source=mailchimp&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=referral-newsletter-en&utm_content=cta\n\nMotivation: Currently getting the DAO to net revenue positive is the direction we trying to go month over month. I don’t see the staking requirement being lifted and maximizing the revenue we can obtain from each source will allow for us to do so and will require us to stake this amount for the foreseeable future. The longer we take to get this increased revenue share the longer the offset to the potential risk will take.\n\nSpecification - This proposal will have PTT work with the treasury to deposit the appropriate tokens and lp them into the proper Liquidity pools and ensure that this is communicated with the Mt Pelerin team.\n\nBenefits - Benefits include increased revenue from the Mt. Pelerin onramp each month. Currently, the volumes on this on-ramp are lower than the others, but hopefully, with continued growth in our international customer base with the help of globalization, and our continued support of other languages, we will see this revenue growth over time.\n\nSee below for the last three months of data in terms of revenue based on a point of time for the USD value of foreign currency conversions.\n\nLINK - https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vVXrNO90XvSIstK9zB5EDrgkm-u1glPN/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=109763150483203399382&rtpof=true&sd=true\n\nDrawbacks - Due to the fact it would LP’d position, it would be at risk of impermanent loss, but that can be favorable and unfavorable. In addition, there is always smart contract risk involved with any position.\nVote -\nFor\nFor with Changes (please comment below as to what changes)\nAgainst (please comment why you are against)",

      "title": "SCP 116 - Nomination of @Hpayne to become the new Marketing Workstream Leader",
      "content": "PROPOSAL DESCRIPTION\n\nThis proposal is an addendum to [SCP-99] and is a nomination of @Hpayne to become the full-time Marketing Workstream Leader and transition Tyler out of the Interim Marketing Workstream Leader position. The goal of this addendum is to acknowledge the goals and spirit of SCP-99, continue the success of the Marketing Workstream, and expand on its grassroots strategies for user growth and retention without disrupting the speed of the workstream’s development or structure and allow Tyler to return his cycles to the Operations Workstream as his sole DAO focus.\n\nSummary:\n\nIn accordance with SCP-99, Tyler is currently acting as the Interim Workstream Leader until a suitable candidate can be fielded and nominated to assume the full-time Workstream Leader position. Since the passing of SCP-99, The Marketing Workstream successfully pivoted its focus to areas of improvement around data collection, budget organization and resource accountability, refined and repeatable procedures and workflows, strategy funnels, and transparency and collaboration best practices, all through the mindfully restrictive lens of cost vs. impact, revenue generation, and successful austere strategies in the bearest of bear markets. These goals were developed and maintained while also redefining the workstream’s relationship to other workstreams in the DAO and to the overall Marketing strategy with heavy emphasis on engagement, tracking, and collaboration with Engineering, Product, and Operations to develop product based resources and tools for growth.\n\nMotivation:\n\nGetting the Marketing Workstream to the place it is now has required a lot of hard work and collaboration in thoughtful reconsiderations of previous priorities and budget spends, creative workflows, and a lot of slowing down/modifying/shutting down potential time and energy drains in workflow disguise. The team has proven via these methods that you don’t always have to spend money to make money, and in contrast, at a DAO being lean and efficient is truly the best way to provide scalable value. It was discovered that spending money on marketing resources (i.e. paid ads, influencers, etc) has less direct correlation to our engagement numbers than timely tweets, market conditions, or topical crypto events we can utilize in our lean content engine without additional spend.\n\nTyler has been splitting his time between the Operations and Marketing Workstreams. Over time it has proven that both of these jobs have enough responsibility and requirements for success that they cannot be held in tandem by one person without eventually holding back the potential success of one or both of the workstreams. The nomination of a new fulltime leader now while SCP-99 still has 2 months of budgeted funding allows a new Leader some time in the role before being required to draft up a new proposal for future funding of the Workstream.\n\nThe search for a new fulltime leader of the Workstream has proven to have a number of previously undefined drawbacks from the previous presentation of the search in SCP-99 that has led Tyler to prefer a hire from within; 1. The bear market and recent instability in the presentation of trust in the crypto market has made the position + DAO uncertainty even less appetizing to an outsider and may require additional compensation to qualified applicants the DAO is not interested in providing for the role. 2. Having a new external contributor requires a massive learning curve and blind buy-in in: organizational administration, restricted resources, lean DAO and DAO governance culture among other DAO common practices and could present a flight risk upon inheriting and being overwhelmed by the requirements of navigating success at the DAO. 3. A new leader requiring another ground-up rebuild of the Workstream’s strategy that could again cost time and money and be yet another reset on the clock of accountability in Marketing. 4. An outsider may require a longer observation and analysis period before feeling comfortable in executing strategies and could burn beyond what the DAO has allotted left in funding for the Marketing Workstream before being able to assert their influence or practices.\n\nIn response to those unforeseen additional complications to an additional new hire coming in at the top level to continue to steer the Marketing Workstream, Tyler found it best to avert those problems and nominate the position to a current contributor who can address any issues arisen with bringing a stranger in to such a high ranking and important role at such a pivotal time. The current Marketing Workstream has shown unanimous support and agreement in Tyler’s nomination of Hpayne to become the new full time leader.\n\nHpayne has proven with his diligence, passion, collaborative spirit, willingness to learn, obsession with data, and continually building body of work at the DAO in the processes and content he leads and orchestrates that he is more than capable of leading this Workstream to continued success and encouraging responsible growth, content, and acquisition strategies for the Marketing Workstream as it’s new full time leader. He has been a pleasure to work alongside since Tyler joined the workstream and has instilled the utmost confidence that he is more than capable of leading the DAO’s marketing efforts successfully.\n\nSpecification\n\nThis proposal addendum identifies Hpayne as the new full-time Marketing Workstream Leader. Tyler will transition all Workstream Leader responsibilities as outlined in [SCP-92] for the Marketing Workstream to Hpayne upon the passing of this nomination in proposal form. Upon a successful transition of roles, responsibilities, and permissions, Tyler will resume full focus back to the Operations Workstream Leader position as his sole contributing role at the DAO.\n\nThis proposal does not increase the current Marketing Workstream term which is budgeted through the end of January 2023. The Goals and KPIs of the Marketing Workstream are to be reassessed post DAO Pow Wow and presented to the community.\n\nBudget:\nimage\n\nBenefits:\nThis proposal allows the Marketing Workstream to identify a full-time Workstream Leader that has Marketing and DAO experience and context for the resources and requirements for success in this environment. This internal nomination allows the current workstream to build off of their current successes with no downtime or change in best practices.\n\nDrawbacks:\nAn internal nomination further reduces the cycles available in a small team with @Hpayne taking on Leader responsibilities on top of his current role and may require additional resources or delegation to maintain obligations.",

      "title": " [SCP 119] Product & Creative Services Workstream Renewal Dec 15-June 15",
      "content": "Note when reading this proposal: We are actively working on the time phased product strategy and plan to have alignment coming out of the DAO WOW. At that point, we will put the new roadmap for the next 6 months up for community voting.\n\nAbstract\nAs a product-centric DAO, the Product & Creative Services Workstream is vital to our success. The Workstream is accountable for a number of activities which are critical to the DAO’s ability to acquire and retain users, grow the FOX ecosystem, and achieve its mission. This is a proposal to continue funding the Product & Creative Services Workstream’s anticipated budget from Dec 15-June 15 2023.\n\nMotivation\nContinuing to fund this workstream will ensure that the ShapeShift DAO can retain the talent that the Workstream has, as we move into the next strategy phase post migration.\nSince the implementation of analytics on app.shapeshift.com, we’ve seen steady growth. As of the writing of this proposal we’re sitting at 20K monthly active users, with a continuing upward trend in users and monthly visitors (although we do expect some slowing around the holiday season). These numbers already demonstrate that even in this bear market we are showing great signs of product market fit. (We can also assume that a portion of our users who we don't have any insights into are using private.shapeshift.com).\n\n![image](ipfs://bafkreid7dvcmojlg6yy55ua4fkxmuqbem2qp5juzan7nhbtm6s2mvw5ihq)\n    \nBy supporting the Product Workstream, the DAO can continue building and rolling out new features, improving the user experience of our app, and move forward with the new proposed strategy; continuing to execute on features that drive user acquisition, retention and product evolution even in the bear market.\n\nSpecification\nIn our last proposal, we outlined a lot of specific goals, and we’ve included a breakdown of those goals and how we did here: https://docs.google.com/document/u/2/d/1CVTqM07NOo0gfdAx8uQDdtkwvJkX5ZbOgEXoP-KgAxQ/edit?usp=sharing\n\nNow that we have sunset Beta, completed migration and have usable data and analytics to work with, we are laser focused on a refreshed strategy for the next 6 months. Previously, our workstream laid out a lot of goals that didn’t have many measurable KPIs, because, well, we didn’t have the tools in place to measure data. Now that we have those in place, this proposal has more high level measurable goals and KPI’s outlined.\n\nGoals & KPIs\nIntroduce and get alignment on a time-phased short-term product strategy for the next 3 months, and then another for the following 3 months. (Phase 1 and Phase 2)\n\nThe new product strategy will include user acquisitions predictions, business cases, timelines and revenue assumptions. Product will monitor the results and update the forecasts regularly and share with the community. We plan to implement the first phase of the new strategy in a 3 month increment. This will allow us to ship and measure the results of each roll out quickly, and evaluate against our predictions. In an effort to remain lean and agile, we plan to keep the product strategy for Phase 2 (the following 3 months) relatively loose at this time. This will give us the flexibility to adjust the roadmap based on the results we’re seeing from the first phase.\n\nWe will also apply for grants for the DAO treasury on some of the features and chains we’re outlining in our product strategy that offer grant programs. We are also currently digging into new revenue streams that are not listed yet in the roadmap, but will report back to the community as we have more details. (one example: affiliate revs for the dapps in wallet connect 2).\n\nIncrease Monthly Active Users to 56,713 by end June 2023\n\nMarch Minimum MAUs 22,500\nJune Minimum MAUs 27,000\n\nMarch optimisitic MAUs 27,616\nJune optimistic MAUs: 56,713\n\nWith the strategy we’ve identified going forward, we aim to become a one-stop, easy-to-use decentralized platform that gives users a single place to view and manage their portfolio and defi positions across multiple chains.\n\nWithout rolling out any new marketable features since migration, we’ve established a baseline for our MAUs at 18,200 with a growth rate of ~2,500 users per month. To forecast monthly active users, the model projects this positive growth trend to continue and has been laid out in pessimistic, realistic, and optimistic scenarios. Further, the model projects the number of new users each feature in the proposed strategy will attract on a monthly basis once it goes live and is marketed. All of the projections were calculated using the best data we could gather to estimate the size of the addressable market and how much we could realistically capture. We plan to work hand-in-hand with marketing on each roll out to achieve the growth goals outlined in this model.\n\nIncrease our WAU/MAU stickiness metric to a minimum of 30%.\n\nThis will be very challenging. Across all industries, an average of 20% stickiness rate is considered good. It's considered exceptionally good if the rate is 25% or more. We're currently trending at 24%.\n(Product stickiness is the tendency of users to keep returning to our product because it's engaging and valuable to them).\n\nOur current WAU/ MAU ratio shows that our product is a weekly usage product. A small portion of our users use our product every day, but the reality shows us that our app is sticky, but most users are using it once or twice a week over the course of a month.\n\nOur aim over time is to increase this ratio by working to improve our user engagement, getting users to interact with and use our app more regularly, and continuing to introduce features and benefits to keep them hooked. We plan to work very closely with marketing on this as well, and make sure we remain in lock-step as we move forward on the new strategy.\n\nTriple the amount of average daily defi confirms by June 15\n\nWe've been doing an average of 21 defi \"confirms\" over the past 2 months, and we plan to improve that too at least 63 a day by the end of this proposal cycle. We are working to improve the user experience in the Defi earn section, and have been running surveys and soliciting feedback from our users around the type of opportunities that are important to them, and see where they align and deviate with our current product plans.\n\nCurrently in Phase 1 of the new strategy we will execute the following in collaboration with marketing to get more users into defi yield earning opportunities\n\nIncrease visibility about relevant opportunities to users based on assets in their wallets in the earn section on other parts of the app\nImplement & market Savers Vaults which allow users to earn great yields on commonly held assets (also assets which they are requesting via our feedback funnels) without any lock up period.\nRework the DeFi earn section to include relevant opportunities, top opportunities and the ability to filter, sort and search\nMarket the Idle integration starting in January of 2023\n\nMaintain an NPS score of 35 of higher\nWe plan to run NPS surveys every couple months with the goal of getting to this number. Once we establish where we’re at with our initial NPS survey we will identify strategies around how to improve and/or maintain it\n\nNPS scores are important because it measures user loyalty; ie the likelihood of repeat users. And this helps us determine how valuable our product offering is, and how that value changes over time. This measure is useful for forecasting growth, revenue, and assessing the health of our brand as well as overall user satisfaction.\n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreihztdfjurctflebicmraxy5kij3a4xv5wdyqz5mgvstnmwtxycpc4)\n    \nUser interviews, surveys and executing strategies to get qualitative feedback from our users\nWe have created a new user feedback channel, and continue to do usability testing. We’ve also started collecting user feedback directly from the app via Pendo by running surveys. Surveys are a powerful way to get the insights we need to continue to inform our strategy. Essentially, by running these surveys we are getting invaluable insights into what works, where we can improve and what our customers think about us. And, so far, this has already resulted in some very valuable insights which have helped inform and validate the current product strategy we are working on.\nWe are also planning to use the tool to ask users to sign up for user interviews and reward them in FOX for participating.\n\nWe also plan to continue to utilize and increase community feedback avenues. We have a great community, and leveraging this relationship will benefit the product and DAO as a whole.\n\nSecure Grant funding from 5 protocols by June 2023\n\nWe have been actively working on the product strategy and in doing so have identified areas for possible grant funding with some of the features and chains we plan to roll out.\nAs of the writing of this proposal we are circulating grant proposals for: Optimism, Thorchain and Cowswap. We also plan to go after grants from BSC and Gnosis Chain, and possibly Osmosis for the next integration phase.\n\nAnd as always:\nContinue to provide feature specifications, designs, product management, and applicable front-end development for features prioritized.\n\nContinue to represent the ShapeShift DAO’s product suite, roadmap, and act as a repository of knowledge.\n\nContinue to monitor user flows and identify areas of improvement to increase conversions.\n\nContinue to help ensure the delivery of prioritized features on time (being built by the core workstream and those being built by bounty hunters), on or under budget, and according to the acceptance criteria defined in each feature spec.\n\nContinue to assist with one-off community projects as needed, and make sure all UX executed by the workstream and outside the workstream are on brand and pass usability.\n\nContinue to help all ShapeShift DAO Workstreams communicate effectively by creating engaging content that is aligned with the brand of ShapeShift DAO.\n\nContinue to communicate ideas, create materials to educate FOX holders, assist in the creative needs to help launch marketing campaigns and expand the effectiveness of the brand.\n\nImprove the new user experience and decrease our bounce rate (currently at 17.69%)\n\nContinue to update and maintain Shapeshift.com\n\nBudget\nThere are only 2 changes to this proposal round in regards to the team. DecentralizedJ is no longer part of the team, as most of you already know, and over the past months Diggy has been evaluating our needs as a workstream. It became very clear that we need additional help, but in a new role that previously did not exist on the workstream. Therefore, this proposal removes the additional PM role, and replaces it with a Product Analyst & Partnership Coordinator. The role will be part time for now.\nFurthermore, with the product strategy work that’s been occurring and the huge lift and assistance to product being provided by PTT, it seems a natural fit that his skills in forecasting, numbers and projections nicely aligned with the role that Diggy had outlined. Therefore, we are proposing to include PTT in the part-time role and he will be splitting his time with his role on Ops. Here is the JD for the new role: LINK\nSo where does that leave us? The Product & Creative Services workstream will consist of 5 members. 3 full-time and 2 part-time\n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreifemdr5dhxiz4gdfzhfmiwnvxtgtpbmcuycsynj6wgbbd25jy7sje)\n  \nOur approved budget for the last round of 6 months was: $364,636 (with $294,053 of that in USDC).\nOur new proposed budget for the next 6 months is $366,240.52 with only $268,092 being requested in USDC as all members of the workstream have agreed to continue taking portions of their salaries in FOX (ranging from 10%-25%). The monthly cost in USDC would be $44,681.92\nFun fact: In October 2022, the workstream gave $45,000 in USDC back to the DAO treasury.\n\nHere is the breakdown of actual stables and FOX allocation for this round:\n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreicz56sziaz6j3itmalfkbdx4vdkyaymugtxkw6dsyvagw6a4mtaje)\n    \n\n*This covers salaries, software, bounties, test funds, etc.\nView the detailed budget here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1L-gfh-06dkKRP7B2MdgmlYblg61glRZ3wd1GccrufUg/edit?usp=sharing\nIf this proposal passes, most of this budget will be distributed in stable coins and FOX as outlined above. The equivalent amount of USDC & FOX will be transferred from the DAO’s treasury to the Product Workstream on Colony on a monthly basis. All unused funds will be returned to the DAO or rolled-over to the next budget cycle.\n\nBenefits\nIf this proposal passes, the DAO will continue to receive the following services which are integral to its success:\n• Proposed feature roadmap encompassing the following products the DAO: ShapeShift Mobile app, web app, shapeshift.com, and any other products the ShapeShift DAO launches\n• Feature specs for prioritized features including goals, success metrics, and acceptance criteria\n• UI/UX for each prioritized feature\n• Front-end development\n• Reporting on product KPIs and feature success metrics (Analytics!)\n• Design-oriented and brand-focused creative support, guidelines, and guardrails to the myriad of projects the DAO will take on\n\nDrawbacks\nThe main potential risk is whether the strategy product has outlined and cost/benefit of the product workstream will be worth it to the DAO’s bottom-line in the long term. To mitigate this risk, only 6 months of funding are being requested. The funds will be managed on Colony and can be revoked by the DAO in a worst-case-scenario.\nVote\nFOR: You support funding the workstream and the anticipated budget for the next 6 months\nAGAINST: You do not support continuing to fund the product workstream",

      "title": "[Ideation] SCP-120: Claim and delegate SAFE Airdrop",
      "content": "## Summary\nThe purpose of this proposal is to claim and delegate the SAFE Tokens rewarded to the DAO Treasury before the deadline of December 27th, 2022 at 2am MST.\n\n## Abstract\nAs a Gnosis Safe, ShapeShift DAO’s Treasury is eligible to claim 11,251.1 SAFE tokens from the SAFE airdrop. Currently the DAO is eligible to claim 5,924.51 SAFE, with the remaining 5,326.58 SAFE vesting linearly until September 28th, 2026. If the DAO does not claim some amount of its unlocked SAFE prior to the December 27th deadline, its allocation will be transferred back to the SafeDAO Treasury. In order to claim, the DAO must select an address to delegate our SAFE voting power to that cannot be the DAO treasury. I am proposing that we delegate to Auryn Macmillan (aka Auryn.eth on [twitter](https://twitter.com/auryn_macmillan) and [etherscan](https://etherscan.io/address/0xd714dd60e22bbb1cbafd0e40de5cfa7bbdd3f3c8)) , an active member of the Ethereum ecosystem, and long-time contributor to Gnosis, Safe, and Gnosis Guild.\n\nIf anyone is interested in going through the claiming flow and learning more about SAFE Token and the registered delegates, you can go through the claiming process as the DAO treasury [here](https://app.safe.global/eth:0x90A48D5CF7343B08dA12E067680B4C6dbfE551Be/apps?appUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fapps.gnosis-safe.io%2Fsafe-claiming-app).\n\n## Motivation\nThe only cost to claim the airdrop is a small amount of gas required to execute the transactions. While SAFE is not yet transferable, it’s likely that the community will vote to enable transferability in the near future, which will likely give SAFE a monetary value. Claiming this airdrop helps to grow and diversify ShapeShift’s treasury while also supporting decentralized governance of the Safe protocol, which the DAO depends on to power its Treasury.\n \n## Specification \nIf this proposal passes, the transactions to claim the vested portion of the airdrop and delegate voting power to Auryn.eth will be executed prior to the December 27th deadline. Additionally, passing this proposal will delegate authority to the Treasury Management and Diversification Committee to manage both vested and unvested SAFE tokens going forward.\n\n## Benefits\nThe primary benefits are treasury diversification and growth as well as supporting the decentralized governance of the Safe Protocol.\n\n## Drawbacks\nThere is inherent risk when interacting with any smart contract. However, the Safe token as well as the airdrop and vesting contracts have all been [audited](https://github.com/safe-global/safe-token#audits), and multiple DAOs with large treasuries have already claimed without issue.",

      "content": "incubation link - https://forum.shapeshift.com/thread/scp-tbd-deposit-3500-of-mps-usdc-liquidity-to-increase-rev-share-41480\n\nSummary: Deposit $3500 of liquidity into the Mt. Pelerin Liquidity pool in order to earn an extra 35% of revenue on each purchase through Mt. Pelerin On-Ramp.\n\nAbstract: This would allow for the DAO to earn from the current 15% of all fees on purchases through Mt. Pelerin to 50%. The focus on the DAO currently increasing MAU which should ultimately drive more revenues through using features like onramps like Mt. Pelerin. We tried to get the 50% rev share without the staking of $3500 worth of MPS/USDC, but were ultimately declined but were told we could get the same boost if we deposited into the pool.\n\nLink to the Referral Program - https://www.mtpelerin.com/invite?utm_source=mailchimp&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=referral-newsletter-en&utm_content=cta\n\nMotivation: Currently getting the DAO to net revenue positive is the direction we trying to go month over month. I don’t see the staking requirement being lifted and maximizing the revenue we can obtain from each source will allow for us to do so and will require us to stake this amount for the foreseeable future. The longer we take to get this increased revenue share the longer the offset to the potential risk will take.\n\nSpecification - This proposal will have PTT work with the treasury to deposit the appropriate tokens and lp them into the proper Liquidity pools and ensure that this is communicated with the Mt Pelerin team. \n\nBenefits -  Benefits include increased revenue from the Mt. Pelerin onramp each month. Currently, the volumes on this on-ramp are lower than the others, but hopefully, with continued growth in our international customer base with the help of globalization, and our continued support of other languages, we will see this revenue growth over time.\n\nSee below for the last three months of data in terms of revenue based on a point of time for the USD value of foreign currency conversions.\n\nLINK - https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vVXrNO90XvSIstK9zB5EDrgkm-u1glPN/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=109763150483203399382&rtpof=true&sd=true\n\n\nDrawbacks - Due to the fact it would LP’d position, it would be at risk of impermanent loss, but that can be favorable and unfavorable. In addition, there is always smart contract risk involved with any position.\nVote -\nFor\nFor with Changes (please comment below as to what changes)\nAgainst  (please comment why you are against)",

      "title": "IDEATION - SCP 117 - Realign Support responsibilities under the Operations Workstream",
      "content": "SUMMARY:\nA counter proposal to: [SCP - TBD] Renew Customer Support Workstream Jan 1st - April 30th 2023 A proposal to transfer all customer support , ticket and helpdesk responsibilities to the Operations Workstream without renewing the Support Workstream after December, with no additions to the Current Operations Budget.\n\nABSTRACT:\nThe intention of this proposal is a renewed update of the strategy first presented in the previously posted and discussed forum post: [SCP-TBD] - Sunsetting the Support Workstream Proposal  The ideas, sentiment, and data from the previous post of this strategy have only grown to further support the realignment of support resources required to match the DAOs current needs. \n\nMOTIVATION:\nThe average ticket count per week, since the previous proposal for the sunsetting of the Support Workstream was posted, is now at 84.3 tickets/week. When this was last suggested the Average ticket/week number was 181.5.  This shows the demand for support has decreased an additional  53% over that time period. \nWhen this information was last presented, the Support workstream took it on themselves to do discovery and work with the community on addressing the concerns that were raised in this post here: Open Discussion for Customer Support Workstream \"styles\" but did not engage or further the discussion beyond the initial introduction of the topic.  While there have been salary reductions introduced and enacted, addressing the DAO’s current support needs seems to have been neglected.\nHelp Desk article generation and maintenance will easily be absorbed into current Operations procedural best practices of releases at no additional cost, or could be bountied out for much much less per average article. These articles have already begun to be exported to a much cheaper and already budgeted solution the DAO already pays for in gitbook. A demo of the future ShapeShift DAO helpdesk can be viewed here. If this proposal passes Operations will continue the transition of the helpdesk to gitbook and remove the dependency and cost of the helpdesk.\nUnder this proposal, current support operations would be moved full time to Discord to be monitored and adminned by the current Operations Workstream team. It will remove the ticketing system utilized by Zendesk, removing the cost of Zendesk from any DAO budgets completely. This functionality is already available in our current Discord and would take very little changes to be transitioned to our main form of support ticketing.\nTyler | ShapeShift and Tshifty both have years of combined customer support experience at Shapeshift doing this exact role, and are extremely familiar with the responsibilities, resources, procedures, and best practices. The rest of the Operations Workstream have been providing troubleshooting and general customer support help in the Discord since they all joined the DAO; any further training to maintain the same level of quality support ShapeShift users are accustomed to can be easily implemented. \nOperations acknowledges and appreciates all of the hard work that was made by the Support Workstream through the years with ShapeShift to keep our support services top tier in the industry. This proposal includes a 1 month Severance payment for all contributors current salaries listed in:  [SCP - TBD] Renew Customer Support Workstream Jan 1st - April 30th 2023. \n\nSPECIFICATION:\nDo not renew the Support Workstream and transition support responsibilities to the Operations Workstream.\nTransfer ownership of the Support Zendesk permissions and transition to the free tier as soon as possible with a final transfer to Gitbook as the new helpdesk home.\nProvide 1 month of Severance pay to all support workstream contributors on Jan 1st 2023. \nProvide Support in Discord via Operations Assistants (1 assistant per shift, buddy system for coverage) that would mirror and align inside the current regression testing responsibility schedule.\nUpdate all mentions of live chat and support redirects to the Discord\nAddress any other current assumed Support responsibilities (lobby.so, etc) with the DAO to sunset or continue as extra-curricular responsibilities based on the communities desire to fund and focus.\n\nBudget: \nSeverance to be paid in USDC on January 1st:\n\n\nWhat This Proposal Would Do:\nMove ticket response, zendesk permissions, help desk: maintenance, QA, and admin responsibilities for all support services of the ShapeShift DAO to the Operations Workstream and provide 1 month Severance to the above listed Support Workstream contributors.\n\nBENEFITS: This proposal will save the DAO $38,900 in USDC from now through April 30th and realign our current support resources to more accurately reflect the current needs of the DAO. This would also reduce touches, context required, and middlemen in the process of bug reporting to resolution. \n\nDRAWBACKS: Support transition may result in temporarily increased ticket response time.",

      "title": "Ideation [SCP 119]  Product & Creative Services Workstream Renewal Dec 15-June 15",
      "content": "Note when reading this proposal: We are actively working on the time phased product strategy and plan to have alignment coming out of the DAO WOW. At that point, we will put the new roadmap for the next 6 months up for community voting.\n \nAbstract\nAs a product-centric DAO, the Product & Creative Services Workstream is vital to our success. The Workstream is accountable for a number of activities which are critical to the DAO’s ability to acquire and retain users, grow the FOX ecosystem, and achieve its mission. This is a proposal to continue funding the Product & Creative Services Workstream’s anticipated budget from Dec 15-June 15 2023.\n \nMotivation\nContinuing to fund this workstream will ensure that the ShapeShift DAO can retain the talent that the Workstream has, as we move into the next strategy phase post migration. \nSince the implementation of analytics on app.shapeshift.com, we’ve seen steady growth. As of the writing of this proposal we’re sitting at 20K monthly active users, with a continuing upward trend in users and monthly visitors (although we do expect some slowing around the holiday season). These numbers already demonstrate that even in this bear market we are showing great signs of product market fit. (We can also assume that a portion of our users who we don't have any insights into are using private.shapeshift.com). \n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreiayxjzv6oheqa4kuqob2skkypsy3xp5jaez2zvcbm5tfzgu5747f4)\n    \n\n\nBy supporting the Product Workstream, the DAO can continue building and rolling out new features, improving the user experience of our app, and move forward with the new proposed strategy; continuing to execute on features that drive user acquisition, retention and product evolution even in the bear market.\n \nSpecification\nIn our last proposal, we outlined a lot of specific goals, and we’ve included a breakdown of those goals and how we did here: https://docs.google.com/document/u/2/d/1CVTqM07NOo0gfdAx8uQDdtkwvJkX5ZbOgEXoP-KgAxQ/edit?usp=sharing\n \nNow that we have sunset Beta, completed migration and have usable data and analytics to work with, we are laser focused on a refreshed strategy for the next 6 months. Previously, our workstream laid out a lot of goals that didn’t have many measurable KPIs, because, well, we didn’t have the tools in place to measure data. Now that we have those in place, this proposal has more high level measurable goals and KPI’s outlined.\n \nGoals & KPIs\nIntroduce and get alignment on a time-phased short-term product strategy for the next 3 months, and then another for the following 3 months. (Phase 1 and Phase 2)\n \nThe new product strategy will include user acquisitions predictions, business cases, timelines and revenue assumptions. Product will monitor the results and update the forecasts regularly and share with the community. We plan to implement the first phase of the new strategy in a 3 month increment. This will allow us to ship and measure the results of each roll out quickly, and evaluate against our predictions. In an effort to remain lean and agile, we plan to keep the product strategy for Phase 2 (the following 3 months) relatively loose at this time. This will give us the flexibility to adjust the roadmap based on the results we’re seeing from the first phase.\n \nWe will also apply for grants for the DAO treasury on some of the features and chains we’re outlining in our product strategy that offer grant programs. We are also currently digging into new revenue streams that are not listed yet in the roadmap, but will report back to the community as we have more details. (one example: affiliate revs for the dapps in wallet connect 2).\n \n \nIncrease Monthly Active Users to 56,713 by end June 2023\n \nMarch Minimum MAUs 22,500\nJune Minimum MAUs 27,000\n\nMarch optimisitic MAUs 27,616\nJune optimistic MAUs: 56,713\n \nWith the strategy we’ve identified going forward, we aim to become a one-stop, easy-to-use decentralized platform that gives users a single place to view and manage their portfolio and defi positions across multiple chains.\n \nWithout rolling out any new marketable features since migration, we’ve established a baseline for our MAUs at 18,200 with a growth rate of ~2,500 users per month. To forecast monthly active users, the model projects this positive growth trend to continue and has been laid out in pessimistic, realistic, and optimistic scenarios. Further, the model projects the number of new users each feature in the proposed strategy will attract on a monthly basis once it goes live and is marketed. All of the projections were calculated using the best data we could gather to estimate the size of the addressable market and how much we could realistically capture. We plan to work hand-in-hand with marketing on each roll out to achieve the growth goals outlined in this model. \n \n\nIncrease our WAU/MAU stickiness metric to a minimum of 30%.\n \nThis will be very challenging. Across all industries, an average of 20% stickiness rate is considered good. It's considered exceptionally good if the rate is 25% or more. We're currently trending at 24%.\n(Product stickiness is the tendency of users to keep returning to our product because it's engaging and valuable to them).\n \nOur current WAU/ MAU ratio shows that our product is a weekly usage product. A small portion of our users use our product every day, but the reality shows us that our app is sticky, but most users are using it once or twice a week over the course of a month.\n \nOur aim over time is to increase this ratio by working to improve our user engagement, getting users to interact with and use our app more regularly, and continuing to introduce features and benefits to keep them hooked. We plan to work very closely with marketing on this as well, and make sure we remain in lock-step as we move forward on the new strategy.\n \n \nTriple the amount of average daily defi confirms by June 15\n\nWe've been doing an average of 21 defi \"confirms\" over the past 2 months, and we plan to improve that too at least 63 a day by the end of this proposal cycle. We are working to improve the user experience in the Defi earn section, and have been running surveys and soliciting feedback from our users around the type of opportunities that are important to them, and see where they align and deviate with our current product plans. \n \nCurrently in Phase 1 of the new strategy we will execute the following in collaboration with marketing to get more users into defi yield earning opportunities\n \nIncrease visibility about relevant opportunities to users based on assets in their wallets in the earn section on other parts of the app   \nImplement & market Savers Vaults which allow users to earn great yields on commonly held assets (also assets which they are requesting via our feedback funnels) without any lock up period.\nRework the DeFi earn section to include relevant opportunities, top opportunities and the ability to filter, sort and search\nMarket the Idle integration starting in January of 2023\n \nMaintain an NPS score of 35 of higher\nWe plan to run NPS surveys every couple months with the goal of getting to this number. Once we establish where we’re at with our initial NPS survey we will identify strategies around how to improve and/or maintain it\n \nNPS scores are important because it measures user loyalty; ie the likelihood of repeat users. And this helps us determine how valuable our product offering is, and how that value changes over time. This measure is useful for forecasting growth, revenue, and assessing the health of our brand as well as overall user satisfaction.\n  \n![image](ipfs://bafkreictqjq6vjr76erfwvddsmkkpd2ammockatlwfixpwu2fsmgjceace)\n    \n \nUser interviews, surveys and executing strategies to get qualitative feedback from our users\nWe have created a new user feedback channel, and continue to do usability testing. We’ve also started collecting user feedback directly from the app via Pendo by running surveys. Surveys are a powerful way to get the insights we need to continue to inform our strategy. Essentially, by running these surveys we are getting invaluable insights into what works, where we can improve and what our customers think about us. And, so far, this has already resulted in some very valuable insights which have helped inform and validate the current product strategy we are working on. \nWe are also planning to use the tool to ask users to sign up for user interviews and reward them in FOX for participating.\n\nWe also plan to continue to utilize and increase community feedback avenues. We have a great community, and leveraging this relationship will benefit the product and DAO as a whole.\n\nSecure Grant funding from 5 protocols by June 2023\n\nWe have been actively working on the product strategy and in doing so have identified areas for possible grant funding with some of the features and chains we plan to roll out.\nAs of the writing of this proposal we are circulating grant proposals for: Optimism, Thorchain and Cowswap. We also plan to go after grants from BSC and Gnosis Chain, and possibly Osmosis for the next integration phase.\n \nAnd as always:\nContinue to provide feature specifications, designs, product management, and applicable front-end development for features prioritized.\n \nContinue to represent the ShapeShift DAO’s product suite, roadmap, and act as a repository of knowledge.\n \nContinue to monitor user flows and identify areas of improvement to increase conversions.\n \nContinue to help ensure the delivery of prioritized features on time (being built by the core workstream and those being built by bounty hunters), on or under budget, and according to the acceptance criteria defined in each feature spec.\n \nContinue to assist with one-off community projects as needed, and make sure all UX executed by the workstream and outside the workstream are on brand and pass usability.\n \nContinue to help all ShapeShift DAO Workstreams communicate effectively by creating engaging content that is aligned with the brand of ShapeShift DAO.\n \nContinue to communicate ideas, create materials to educate FOX holders, assist in the creative needs to help launch marketing campaigns and expand the effectiveness of the brand.\n\nImprove the new user experience and decrease our bounce rate (currently at 17.69%)\n \nContinue to update and maintain Shapeshift.com\n \nBudget\nThere are only 2 changes to this proposal round in regards to the team. DecentralizedJ is no longer part of the team, as most of you already know, and over the past months Diggy has been evaluating our needs as a workstream. It became very clear that we need additional help, but in a new role that previously did not exist on the workstream. Therefore, this proposal removes the additional PM role, and replaces it with a Product Analyst & Partnership Coordinator. The role will be part time for now.\nFurthermore, with the product strategy work that’s been occurring and the huge lift and assistance to product being provided by PTT, it seems a natural fit that his skills in forecasting, numbers and projections nicely aligned with the role that Diggy had outlined. Therefore, we are proposing to include PTT in the part-time role and he will be splitting his time with his role on Ops. Here is the JD for the new role: LINK\nSo where does that leave us? The Product & Creative Services workstream will consist of 5 members. 3 full-time and 2 part-time\n![image](ipfs://bafkreibrr3zk73qvp3nv2mqnyhothsb5ffnl2775q6q57ho5vyna5zthc4)\n    \nOur approved budget for the last round of 6 months was: $364,636 (with $294,053 of that in USDC). \nOur new proposed budget for the next 6 months is $366,240.52 with only $268,092 being requested in USDC as all members of the workstream have agreed to continue taking portions of their salaries in FOX (ranging from 10%-25%).  The monthly cost in USDC would be $44,681.92\nFun fact: In October 2022, the workstream gave $45,000 in USDC back to the DAO treasury.\n \nHere is the breakdown of actual stables and FOX allocation for this round:\n![image](ipfs://bafkreiespd2gcvttcwwli2bmletk3nkv3idbdocqh7ruv2b6ks2ctd6jm4)\n    \n*This covers salaries, software, bounties, test funds, etc. \nView the detailed budget here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1L-gfh-06dkKRP7B2MdgmlYblg61glRZ3wd1GccrufUg/edit?usp=sharing\nIf this proposal passes, most of this budget will be distributed in stable coins and FOX as outlined above. The equivalent amount of USDC & FOX will be transferred from the DAO’s treasury to the Product Workstream on Colony on a monthly basis. All unused funds will be returned to the DAO or rolled-over to the next budget cycle.\n \nBenefits\nIf this proposal passes, the DAO will continue to receive the following services which are integral to its success:\n• Proposed feature roadmap encompassing the following products the DAO: ShapeShift Mobile app, web app, shapeshift.com, and any other products the ShapeShift DAO launches\n• Feature specs for prioritized features including goals, success metrics, and acceptance criteria\n• UI/UX for each prioritized feature\n• Front-end development\n• Reporting on product KPIs and feature success metrics (Analytics!)\n• Design-oriented and brand-focused creative support, guidelines, and guardrails to the myriad of projects the DAO will take on\n \nDrawbacks\nThe main potential risk is whether the strategy product has outlined and cost/benefit of the product workstream will be worth it to the DAO’s bottom-line in the long term. To mitigate this risk, only 6 months of funding are being requested. The funds will be managed on Colony and can be revoked by the DAO in a worst-case-scenario.\nVote\nFOR: You support funding the workstream and the anticipated budget for the next 6 months\nAGAINST: You do not support continuing to fund the product workstream",

      "title": "Ideation - SCP (115): Jan-April Customer Support Workstream Renewal",
      "content": "Ideation post link: https://forum.shapeshift.com/thread/ideation-scp-115-jan-april-customer-support-workstream-renewal-41514\n\nSummary: The Customer Support workstream would like to offer 7 days a Week Customer Support Services for 4 Months. During these 4 months we want to focus primarily on using the Discord ticketing system to assist our users. \n\nAbstract: For years ShapeShift has been known to have some of the best customer service in the crypto space. One year after transitioning to a DAO, this fact remains. Our compact support team is full of experienced and vetted agents who our users can trust to help them out when something inevitably goes wrong within our new experience, as well as some legacy products that still exist. In an industry full of scammers/bad actors; having reliable customer support members, who can be trusted with the most sensitive of user information, is priceless. We’d love to continue offering our services in delighting users when they need a hand. Below you will see how we’ve adjusted our budget to better meet the needs of the DAO during these bearish times, while also focusing on a more Discord-centric support style. \n\nMotivation:\n\nShapeShift DAO has accomplished a LOT in the past year. As our talented team continues to build out awesome interfaces for our users, occasionally things go wrong. Having a designated customer support team full of experienced team members who can assist our wonderful users in time of need is one of the key aspects of being an overall great service. It is important to remember who we are building for, our users. These days, there are many options when it comes to which crypto platform to use. Having a trustworthy and knowledgeable customer support team will help us stand out above our competition. \n\n2023 Objectives:\n\nTransition to a Discord-first support team by the end of January.\nBag 10 reviews total each month (Trust Pilot and mobile app reviews)\nMaintain a helpdesk to educate community members and users on our products and services.\nContinue to delight and effectively assist users with all of their crypto needs.\n\nTransition to a Discord-first support team by the end of January.\n\nWe want to use Discord for customer support more than we use Zendesk. This means directing users who need help to go to the #contact-support channel where one of our support agents can assist them in a live chat fashion. Offering support right in Discord where the majority of our community resides will help make the ShapeShift DAO Discord a one stop shop for our users. Ticket transcripts are readily available via the Tickets Bot. Over the past month 1/2 we have noticed an uptick in Discord tickets, we want this trend to continue. Being able to interact with our users and troubleshoot with them in real time is a great option. We will continue to have 4 Zendesk licenses until the end of January ($500/month). Starting in February we will cut down to 2 licenses for just Mogie and Donna ($125/month and when Donna returns from leave, $250/month). Depending on ticket count and how effective Discord seems to be, we will consider ending our Zendesk account completely. While Discord is the DeFi community norm, there are still many users out there who are loyal to ShapeShift and do not have a Discord account, so for now Zendesk is a great tool. Zendesk also provides privacy and organizational tools that assist in providing great support.\n\n\nBag 10 reviews total each month (Trust Pilot and mobile app reviews).\n\nWe want to continue our campaign of increasing our Trust Pilot and mobile app reviews. Our goal will be 10 total each month pursued through Discord and Zendesk. We’ve seen a ton of success with this over the past year. Our current Trust Pilot score stands at 4.0! https://www.trustpilot.com/review/shapeshift.com \n\nHelpdesk to educate community members and users on our products and services.\nI have started and will continue to migrate help desk articles over to Gitbook. This is in preparation for the potential event of quitting Zendesk completely. Any suggestions for articles can be directed to @mogie. I also have a Twitter account (@DAO_Shift) used to post articles, retweet ShapeShift (and other community members), and direct users to get in contact with our support team when applicable. \n\nContinue to delight and effectively assist users with all of their crypto needs.\n\nOur team consists of members who have been handling crypto related customer support issues for several years. We are dedicated to helping our users and it still bums us out if we cannot find a solution for someone. Helping our users find a solution to their problem(s) and giving them the best experience possible truly makes us happy.\n\n\nMisc notes:\n\nNo more 24/7 support, instead Mon-Fri 9am -1am (EST) with @Carmina working 5pm-1am on Sat/Sun. \nNo more LVAs - this means paying workstream members directly with USDC. No more needing Colony payouts by the 12th every month.\nWith @Mogie being the only US workstream member, he will be the main point of contact during ‘standard’ US hours.\n@Donna will be away from work for her maternity leave from Nov 24-March ~1st. She is a vital part of our team and we want to ensure she has enough time to recover before returning to work.\nWe are asking for a 4 month contract vs 6 month. Given the DAO’s current runway and decline in ticket volume, we think this is a fair request and will allow us to revisit staffing/budget/overall workstream necessity after 4 months.\n\nStaffing:\n\nWorkstream Leader/Helpdesk Manager -  @mogie\n- The helpdesk manager creates and oversees the creation, editing and auditing process of our helpdesk content.\n- As a workstream leader, Mogie will handle all US-timezone product meetings that require support representation (i.e Go/No Gos, governance calls, etc). He will handle payroll, training consultation, proposal management, cross-team communication, and other high-level needs. \n- Completing customer requests with the utmost accuracy and efficiency.\n\n\nSupport Staff Manager - @donna \n- Manager’s main role is to ensure quality support and training are provided to all support agents, responsible for staff scheduling, Zendesk management, hosting weekly meeting/huddle with support staff.\n- Completing customer requests with the utmost accuracy and efficiency.\n- Informal QA for Miguel and Carmina.\n- Scheduling\n- Build trainings\n- Create ticket flow systems for “bug incidences” to ensure proper customer communication.\n\n\nSupport Agent (part time) - @Carmina\n- Completing customer requests with the utmost accuracy and efficiency.\n- Managing Trust Pilot/Mobile App reviews (reporting spam, responding, sending invites). Communicate with @0xean any negative reviews. (Once Donna returns this will be her responsibility since she will be full time).\n- Creating triage threads/reporting issues to Ops.\n\n\nSupport Agent (part time) - @Miguel\n\n- Completing customer requests with the utmost accuracy and efficiency.\n- Weekly Ops Sprint (until Donna returns).\n- Creating triage threads/reporting issues to Ops.\n\nSome changes to highlight:\n\nMegan will be stepping down from her role.\nCarmina and Miguel will be moving to part time hours.\nDonna will be on maternity leave until March.\n\nWhy 4 Team Members?\nWe want to make sure we have the most possible Support coverage as possible, even on the weekends. @mogie will be checking in on the weekends and Carmina will cover 3pm-11pm MST on Sat/Sun. Mon-Fri there will be coverage from 7am-11pm (Tuesday being the exception of official coverage ending at 7pm since that will be the half day for Carmina and Miguel). Donna will be out for the majority of this proposal period (she returns in March) so depending on workload we can revisit the staffing needs come May. We have found that having at least two team members working at the same time allows us to bounce questions off each other and find the most accurate/timely solutions for our users.\n\nSchedule\n-screenshot did not post, you can see it in the forum post (link above).\n \nMonthly Budget (USDC):\n\nCarmina: 1000\nMiguel: 800 \n\nMogie: 5500\nDonna: 4500\n\n11,800 in salaries  \n+500 for Zendesk\n12,300 TOTAL/month\n\n(57% decrease from current workstream budget: 28,500)\n\n4 month proposal (Jan 1- April 30) grand total = 49,200 USDC from the DAO.\n\nBenefits:\nEnsure our users get timely support from a trusted team.\nCoverage on weekends.\n\nDrawbacks:\n49,200 USDC spend from Jan 1-April 30, 2023.\n\nVote:\n“For/Yes with no amendments/changes” = Hiring and funding 4 months of Customer Support services. \n“For/Yes with amendments/changes”\n“Against/No” = Do not hire and fund the Customer Support workstream for the aforementioned time period.",

      "title": "IDEATION - SCP 116 - Nomination of @Hpayne to become the new Marketing Workstream Leader",
      "content": "PROPOSAL DESCRIPTION\n\nThis proposal is an addendum to [SCP-99] and is a nomination of @Hpayne to become the full-time Marketing Workstream Leader and transition Tyler out of the Interim Marketing Workstream Leader position. The goal of this addendum is to acknowledge the goals and spirit of SCP-99, continue the success of the Marketing Workstream, and expand on its grassroots strategies for user growth and retention without disrupting the speed of the workstream’s development or structure and allow Tyler to return his cycles to the Operations Workstream as his sole DAO focus.\n\nSummary:\n\nIn accordance with SCP-99, Tyler is currently acting as the Interim Workstream Leader until a suitable candidate can be fielded and nominated to assume the full-time Workstream Leader position. Since the passing of SCP-99, The Marketing Workstream successfully pivoted its focus to areas of improvement around data collection, budget organization and resource accountability, refined and repeatable procedures and workflows, strategy funnels, and transparency and collaboration best practices, all through the mindfully restrictive lens of cost vs. impact, revenue generation, and successful austere strategies in the bearest of bear markets.  These goals were developed and maintained while also redefining the workstream’s relationship to other workstreams in the DAO and to the overall Marketing strategy with heavy emphasis on engagement, tracking, and collaboration with Engineering, Product, and Operations to develop product based resources and tools for growth.  \n\nMotivation:\n\nGetting the Marketing Workstream to the place it is now has required a lot of hard work and collaboration in thoughtful reconsiderations of previous priorities and budget spends, creative workflows, and a lot of slowing down/modifying/shutting down potential time and energy drains in workflow disguise.  The team has proven via these methods that you don’t always have to spend money to make money, and in contrast, at a DAO being lean and efficient is truly the best way to provide scalable value. It was discovered that spending money on marketing resources (i.e. paid ads, influencers, etc) has less direct  correlation to our engagement numbers than timely tweets, market conditions, or topical crypto events we can utilize in our lean content engine without additional spend.  \n\nTyler has been splitting his time between the Operations and Marketing Workstreams. Over time it has proven that both of these jobs have enough responsibility and requirements for success that they cannot be held in tandem by one person without eventually holding back the potential success of one or both of the workstreams.  The nomination of a new fulltime leader now while SCP-99 still has 2 months of budgeted funding allows a new Leader some time in the role before being required to draft up a new proposal for future funding of the Workstream. \n\nThe search for a new fulltime leader of the Workstream has proven to have a number of previously undefined drawbacks from the previous presentation of the search in SCP-99 that has led Tyler to prefer a hire from within;  1. The bear market and recent instability in the presentation of trust in the crypto market has made the position + DAO uncertainty even less appetizing to an outsider and may require additional compensation to qualified applicants the DAO is not interested in providing for the role. 2. Having a new external contributor requires a massive learning curve and blind buy-in in: organizational administration, restricted resources, lean DAO and DAO governance culture among other DAO common practices and could present a flight risk upon inheriting and being overwhelmed by the requirements of navigating success at the DAO. 3. A new leader requiring another ground-up rebuild of the Workstream’s strategy that could again cost time and money and be yet another reset on the clock of accountability in Marketing. 4. An outsider may require a longer observation and analysis period before feeling comfortable in executing strategies and could burn beyond what the DAO has allotted left in funding for the Marketing Workstream before being able to assert their influence or practices. \n \nIn response to those unforeseen additional complications to an additional new hire coming in at the top level to continue to steer the Marketing Workstream, Tyler found it best to avert those problems and nominate the position to a current contributor who can address any issues arisen with bringing a stranger in to such a high ranking and important role at such a pivotal time.  The current Marketing Workstream has shown unanimous support and agreement in Tyler’s nomination of Hpayne to become the new full time leader.  \n\nHpayne has proven with his diligence, passion, collaborative spirit, willingness to learn, obsession with data, and continually building body of work at the DAO in the processes and content he leads and orchestrates that he is more than capable of leading this Workstream to continued success and encouraging responsible growth, content, and acquisition strategies for the Marketing Workstream as it’s new full time leader. He has been a pleasure to work alongside since Tyler joined the workstream and has instilled the utmost confidence that he is more than capable of leading the DAO’s marketing efforts successfully. \n\nSpecification\n\nThis proposal addendum identifies Hpayne as the new full-time Marketing Workstream Leader. Tyler will transition all Workstream Leader responsibilities as outlined in [SCP-92] for the Marketing Workstream to Hpayne upon the passing of this nomination in proposal form. Upon a successful transition of roles, responsibilities, and permissions, Tyler will resume full focus back to the Operations Workstream Leader position as his sole contributing role at the DAO. \n\nThis proposal does not increase the current Marketing Workstream term which is budgeted through the end of January 2023.  The Goals and KPIs of the Marketing Workstream are to be reassessed post DAO Pow Wow and presented to the community. \n\nBudget:\n![image](ipfs://bafkreidkwego32aku4k3y73cd7xhyz5hqwxc533agp7bvhz7ashoratai4)\n    \nBenefits:\nThis proposal allows the Marketing Workstream to identify a full-time Workstream Leader that has Marketing and DAO experience and context for the resources and requirements for success in this environment. This internal nomination allows the current workstream to build off of their current successes with no downtime or change in best practices. \n\nDrawbacks:\nAn internal nomination further reduces the cycles available in a small team with @Hpayne taking on Leader responsibilities on top of his current role and may require additional resources or delegation to maintain obligations.",

      "title": "[SCP-113] Handover of account ownership and administration to the DAO",
      "content": "#### Summary\n\nThe Fox Foundation currently administers several accounts on behalf of the DAO.  Where possible, the Foundation would like to turn these accounts over to be fully controlled by trusted DAO members. This will not impact billing in any manner, but will be a step toward moving the DAO towards retaining more control of the related accounts and the Foundation relinquishing control and responsibilities. \n\n#### Abstract\n\nThe Fox Foundation will create and fund a 1password account to store credentials to the below enumerated accounts.  The 1password account will be paid for by the Fox Foundation for one year and access to the 1password account will be delegated to the signers of the Shapeshift DAO’s multisig and any workstream leader that has tenure greater than 1 year. The Fox Foundation will retain access to any paid account solely for billing purposes and will relinquish any oversight or administrative roles otherwise associated with the accounts. \n\n#### Motivation\n\nTo continually move the Shapeshift DAO towards self sufficiency and the eventual wind down of the Fox Foundation. \n\n\n#### Specification\n\n\nThe following accounts will be transferred to the full control of the DAO:\n\n\n- Npmjs\n-  shapeshiftdao\n-  shapeshiftoss\n-  Twitter\n-  Facebook\n-  Instagram\n-  Medium\n-  YouTube\n-  Sprout Social\n-  Notion\n-  Weglot\n-  Fleek\n-  WalletConnect \n    - previously approved by governance, but still awaiting their gnosis safe integration, expected early next year. \n\n\nThe following accounts will be retained by the foundation for now:\n\n\n- Cloudflare\n-  Apple App store\n-  Google Play store\n-  AWS\n-  GoDaddy\n-  TechGDPR\n-  CoinGecko\n-  Infura\n-  Autopilot\n\nAny changes to the accounts in the DAO’s control that will impact billing or costs will need to be pro-actively communicated to the Foundation who will retain the right to approve or reject the requested changes. Any costs that arise from unauthorized changes will be reimbursed by the DAO directly back to the Foundation in USDC within 30 days. \n\nAdditional access needed for DAO contributors will be the responsibility of the trusted DAO members who are owners of the 1password vault. While trusted DAO members will be responsible for granting community members user-level access to any of these services, Sensitive Credentials should never be shared outside of the group. Sensitive Credentials are defined as any account which has permission to revoke or change access of other DAO members, and which control a system or service that falls into one or more of these categories:\n\n-  Ability to move DAO funds\n-  Ability to present any cryptocurrency addresses to any user\n-  Ability to rewrite content on ShapeShift properties (i.e. shapeshift.com domain or similar)\n-  Ability to speak to the world on behalf of the DAO (i.e. Twitter, Facebook, etc.)\nTo minimize the risk of accounts being compromised, each Trusted DAO member will be responsible for adhering to the Password guidelines found here.\n\n#### Benefits \nMove the DAO one step closer to self sufficiency\nAdditional decentralization of control away from a corporate entity\nAllows the DAO to experience any complications that arise from this set up with relatively low risk to see if another solution is needed.\n\n\n#### Drawbacks\nAdditional administrative burden on trusted workstream leaders and multisig signers\nDAO would be financially responsible if changes are made without communication with the foundation or maliciously by a bad actor.

      "title": "Ideation SCP(114): 2023 Jan-Jun Moderation Workstream Renewal Discussion",
      "content": "Summary\nThe Community Moderation Workstream is primarily responsible to support the community and to maintain the integrity of all ShapeShift various platforms such as Discord, The Forum, and Notion. Future platforms that the community chooses to implement may also be included. This workstream is used daily to ensure the smooth operation of the ShapeShift DAO.\nThis proposal is to renew the Moderation Workstream, re-elect Giantkin as leader and fund the workstream through the end of June 2023.\nTotal Ask is $11600/m\n\nCharter\nNo other Proposals past/future are to affect this proposal.\nDuring the proposal run, if at any time Moderation lead needs to leave (or be asked to leave)\nthe Leaders group can force vote out the Moderation lead (or put leader on hold). No other method.\n\nTemp position given to other mod members, number 2 first would be put in ‘charge’ until lead returns, or a new lead is voted in.\n-Hiring/firing is solely based on the Moderation leads decision. Based on discussions, Total amount for proposal will be listed, without breakdown, in proposal, but in other places instead.\nAbstract\nModeration supports all workstreams and all users within each of the platforms it moderates. As we bring more members into the various platforms, moderators act as so much more than bot managers and spam blockers. Not only do the moderators set up the verification process, they are the point of contact for members having issues with the verification process. They function as the greeters of the DAO, if you will. Our team of moderators clears the path for new members, new contributors and new supporters by facilitating a fluid user experience. Enthusiastic about all things defi and crypto, empowering community members, new and old alike, on their journey to self-empowered entrepreneurism.\nMotivation\nThe mission of this workstream is simple: to help people. Moderation is the workstream you never knew you needed, but couldn’t live without. From welcoming new users to setting up Zoom calls to managing bots. Moderation is here to support the community. This workstream strives to create a space that fosters security, growth and innovation.\nOur team of trustworthy, confident and enthusiastic moderators allows for decentralization of community moderation. This may address the point of preventing accusations of vested interest, since only community elected mods have the power to preserve and maintain the DAO culture.\nAs the workstream leader, I want to make the user feel like they are able to relax. Users are most likely talking from their home space, home usually means they feel safe. I want to keep that feeling in our group.\nSpecification\nModerators take on wide variety of tasks, including but not limited to:\n\nOrganize user flow via roles, channels and bots\nCreate and maintain scheduled events in sesh & Discord\nProvide protection from scammers\nWarn abusers (strike system established by Giantkin)\nIssue Bans based on abuse (temp/forever bans)\nProviding Discord support\nFacilitating ‘temps’ for a job, for example, providing the DJ with a role for the event\nHelp maintain and update server images such as avatars, stickers, emojis, etc. (graymachine)\nProvide moderation support (live when possible) for meetings and community events\nDrive users to the proper channels\nContinually monitoring channels, and other server banlists for potential spam/scammers and adding them into our banlist\nTaking part in Support/Ops triage process by shuttling members requesting support to the proper channels, connecting with self help resources, #support, Zendesk, etc as appropriate\nAppropriate use of Admin Power by Moderation Workstream Leader\nMoving Donova from Marketing to Moderation transition for Telegram basic moderation/some repost duties.\nWhat are the goals of this workstream?\n\nProvide 12 hour moderation coverage to ShapeShift DAO’s community channels, with the eventual desired goal to provide 24 hour coverage if needed.\nProactively ban 90% of scammers/bots that try to sneak into ShapeShift discord\nEnsure that most community meetings are scheduled on the calendar\nThe Moderation Workstream is successful when you don’t notice that it’s there.\nEnforce the Code Of Conduct as recently updated, to the best of ability.\nDuring the Jan - June 2022 term, the Moderation Workstream has accomplished the following:\n\nStopped 34 raids (as of the last Allfox in October) (rough handcount)\nSetup a new user flow for Languages\nSustainability updates to server roles and channels\nUpdates to Role Selector\nChanged Captcha Bots to one that has language options\nBenefits\n\nKeeps the discord clear of spammers\nLimits the Scammers on server\nDrawbacks\n\nGrowing member list, growing expense.\n\n",

      "content": "SCP 112: Governance Voting Enhancement-Shielded Voting\n\nSummary\n\nImplement an upgrade to current voting processes.  This would be accomplished by using shielded voting.\n\nAbstract\n\nThis proposal would implement shielded voting for all future governance proposals. Shielded voting is a voting mechanism offered by Snapshot that is deployed on the Shutter Network, using cryptographic thresholds to prevent the front running of votes. Threshold cryptography would enable a group of key holders to create a cryptographic lock that can be opened if a threshold of members (key holders) participate/collaborate. This process would ensure that no one person or group of people would have access to unlock voting results early to potentially influence a proposal. During active proposals shielded voting would encrypt all individual results, only displaying the total amount of voting power that has been deployed.  Once voting as concluded the lock would automatically be removed displaying the detailed results, including who vote for what outcome of the proposal.\n\nMotivation\n\nThe implementation of shielded voting within the DAO would a allow us to maintain transparency in our voting as it is today, but also create a layer of privacy for those members who are voting, to not have their votes shared until the proposal has concluded.  This would also help to elevate the front running of votes, as previously mentions, as well as voting apathy, information asymmetry, and lower participation. Thus, shielded voting could provide non-influenced results in governance, where voting members are encouraged to vote on how their thoughts of the proposal versus the voting power that has been deployed, who has voted, or even being discouraged to vote because of the visual representation that their vote may not matter.\n\nSpecification\n\nIf this proposal passes, shielded voting will be enabled in the ShapeShift DAO’s SnapShot space settings, and a note on shielded voting will be added to the FOX Governance Process. \n\nIn the event that bugs with the beta release of shielded voting cause issues with the governance process, shielded voting may be temporarily disabled until the issues are resolved.\n\nBenefits\n\nThe benefits of shielded voting are simple:\n\n\t1) Increase in privacy during active proposals\n\t2) Less influenced voting\n\t3) Greater participation in governance\n\nDrawbacks\n\nThe Shutter Network acknowledges that the shielded voting system should be considered to be as a beta release.  They cite three specific items that could be risks.  They are as follow:\n\n\t1) The underlying threshold encryption is new and may contain unknown bugs.\n\t2) The infrastructure to communicate the encryption and decryption keys between \t\t\t    Snapshot and Shutter is equally as new.\n\t3) In the initial deployment of the Keyper set (key holders) will not be decentralized.\t\n\nShutter Network also states that due to the way threshold encryption works that there is the possibility that the decryption may fail, but that they take every precaution to avoid this.\n\nVoting\n\nFor/Yes- The community recognized the value of shielded voting and would like to implement\nAgainst/No- The community does not want to implement shielded voting\n\nIncubation Post\n\nIdeation Post ",

      "content": "#### Summary\n\nThe Fox Foundation currently administers several accounts on behalf of the DAO.  Where possible, the Foundation would like to turn these accounts over to be fully controlled by trusted DAO members. This will not impact billing in any manner, but will be a step toward moving the DAO towards retaining more control of the related accounts and the Foundation relinquishing control and responsibilities. \n\n#### Abstract\n\nThe Fox Foundation will create and fund a 1password account to store credentials to the below enumerated accounts.  The 1password account will be paid for by the Fox Foundation for one year and access to the 1password account will be delegated to the signers of the Shapeshift DAO’s multisig and any workstream leader that has tenure greater than 1 year. The Fox Foundation will retain access to any paid account solely for billing purposes and will relinquish any oversight or administrative roles otherwise associated with the accounts. \n\n#### Motivation\n\nTo continually move the Shapeshift DAO towards self sufficiency and the eventual wind down of the Fox Foundation. \n\n\n#### Specification\n\n\nThe following accounts will be transferred to the full control of the DAO:\n\n\n- Npmjs\n-  shapeshiftdao\n-  shapeshiftoss\n-  Twitter\n-  Facebook\n-  Instagram\n-  Medium\n-  YouTube\n-  Sprout Social\n-  Notion\n-  Weglot\n-  Fleek\n-  WalletConnect \n    - previously approved by governance, but still awaiting their gnosis safe integration, expected early next year. \n\n\nThe following accounts will be retained by the foundation for now:\n\n\n- Cloudflare\n-  Apple App store\n-  Google Play store\n-  AWS\n-  GoDaddy\n-  TechGDPR\n-  CoinGecko\n-  Infura\n-  Autopilot\n\nAny changes to the accounts in the DAO’s control that will impact billing or costs will need to be pro-actively communicated to the Foundation who will retain the right to approve or reject the requested changes. Any costs that arise from unauthorized changes will be reimbursed by the DAO directly back to the Foundation in USDC within 30 days. \n\nAdditional access needed for DAO contributors will be the responsibility of the trusted DAO members who are owners of the 1password vault. While trusted DAO members will be responsible for granting community members user-level access to any of these services, Sensitive Credentials should never be shared outside of the group. Sensitive Credentials are defined as any account which has permission to revoke or change access of other DAO members, and which control a system or service that falls into one or more of these categories:\n\n-  Ability to move DAO funds\n-  Ability to present any cryptocurrency addresses to any user\n-  Ability to rewrite content on ShapeShift properties (i.e. shapeshift.com domain or similar)\n-  Ability to speak to the world on behalf of the DAO (i.e. Twitter, Facebook, etc.)\nTo minimize the risk of accounts being compromised, each Trusted DAO member will be responsible for adhering to the Password guidelines found here.\n\n#### Benefits \nMove the DAO one step closer to self sufficiency\nAdditional decentralization of control away from a corporate entity\nAllows the DAO to experience any complications that arise from this set up with relatively low risk to see if another solution is needed.\n\n\n#### Drawbacks\nAdditional administrative burden on trusted workstream leaders and multisig signers\nDAO would be financially responsible if changes are made without communication with the foundation or maliciously by a bad actor.

      "content": "Summary: This proposal is the second part of the initial incubation post for [SCP103] which is asking for a total of up to $7,000 USDC for covering costs and reimbursing travel for DAO members who help out at ETH Denver 2023.\n\nLink - https://forum.shapeshift.com/thread/incubation-scp-tbd-sponsor-a-booth-at-eth-denver-2023-40777\n\nPurpose: Get coverage and help non-Denver local foxes with their travel costs related to attending and assisting with the booth at ETH Denver 2023. Also, getting swag and supplemental informational materials for ETH Denver 2023.\n\nCurrently, we will need about 10 people to cover the booth shifts at ETH Denver this coming year. In order to incentive this, I am suggesting that reimburse up to $500 of travel/event-related costs for contributors who work the booth for at least three shifts. This would be a total request of up to $5000. This would be coordinated through PTT verifying receipts of people and working with the multi-sig to send out the reimbursements after ETH Denver by March 15th. If we are able to cover the shifts at the event with locals who don't need the full travel stipend, the remaining funds will stay in the treasury.\n\nlink to sign up - https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1kZ2wXB8R2TwgZlqwy0WCL1IepiE56LJ0jYC2qTOIlXM/edit?usp=sharing\n\nI would also like to request up to $2000 USDC to cover the costs of purchasing event swag(to be determined what exactly, currently working with gray/marketing/global) and updated supplemental materials(stickers, informational cards, etc) for the event. Any unused funds will be returned to the treasury. I will request these funds upfront sent to PTT and he will handle reimbursing contributors who are purchasing these materials for the event. When the event is over and the reimbursements for travel are made, any unused funds of the $2000(minus gas costs) will be returned to the treasury.\n\n\nPros:\nThis will hopefully help with coverage of the booth for ETH Denver 2023 while also allowing for dedicated foxes to be able to come out and experience ETH Denver 2023 as well.\n\n\nCons:\nThe runway is limited and this would cut into it. While it isn't a huge sum, it does cut into the runway and is a cost to the DAO.\n\nVoting:\nI support this proposal\nI do not support this proposal\nI support this proposal, with changes (If selecting this, please comment changes in the forum)\n\nLink to Incubation: https://forum.shapeshift.com/thread/incubation-scp-tbd-sponsor-a-booth-at-eth-denver-2023-40777\n\nLink to Ideation: https://forum.shapeshift.com/thread/ideation-post-scp-109-eth-denver-2023-travel-reinbursement-and-supplemental-material-costs-41159",

The profitability of the validator depends heavily on us remaining in the “active set” of the top 175 validators. The ShapeShift DAO is the 45th biggest but over 80% of the total delegations are coming from only a few addresses. Through the past year TaxiStake has developed a strong trust relationship with these large delegators.\n\nWhile these delegators support the use of the ShapeShift name for a portion of the revenue split, they have indicated that the biggest reason they delegate to TaxiStake’s validators is not because of the ShapeShift brand or support of the DAO, but because of the availability and the security standards put in place by the TaxiStake team. However, having so few delegators with the majority of the stake on the validator put the validator at risk of falling out of the active set if they were to decide to un-delegate. TaxiStake is proposing the following for both the ShapeShift DAO and TaxiStake to help ensure the validator maintains a solid base of delegated ATOMs while growing overall delegations.\n\nThe revenue split proposed is 75% to TaxiStake and 25% to ShapeShift DAO for a 3 month period (November 1, 2022 - January 31, 2023). TaxiStake will delegate some of revenue it earns from the revenue split and re-delegate it back to the “self delegation address.” This will help keep the ShapeShift validator in the active set and signal to the community that ShapeShift is running this validator on the Cosmos chain for the long haul, with “skin in the game.” The rewards from these self-delegated tokens will all be added to the total revenue split. TaxiStake will retain ownership of these delegated ATOMs. TaxiStake will continue to perform all the maintenance, upgrades, monitoring, and governance tasks as is specified in the expiring terms.\n\nUnder this proposal, the ShapeShift DAO must create a multisig Cosmos address to be controlled by the Treasure Signers (TSes). TaxiStake is requesting that the DAO then re-delegates 50% of the ATOMs it receives in rewards back from that address to the ShapeShift validator. This is also the address used by TaxiStake to send the DAO its revenue split in the form of native ATOMs. Receiving ATOMs earned from the DAO's delegations will give the DAO a new income stream, and more options for managing its treasury.\n\nThe ShapeShift DAO agrees to, at minimum, do bi-monthy promotions/advertising about positive aspects of the ShapeShift DAO branded Cosmos validator. Ideas for topics could be how easy it is to delegate and earn yield using the ShapeShift platform or how delegating to the ShapeShift validator funds further development of Cosmos integration in the platform.\n\nThe DAO is targeting 15% monthly growth rate as specified in the most recent DOA revenue model. https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1z8zHiVuFoDIKHRwKdVY8DAo8WE_LS2jMczBxPHsIRok/edit#gid=0\nIncreasing delegations by half that (7% a month) is adding approximately 68506 ATOMs a month for a total of 205,518 ATOMs in a 3 month period. If the DAO can hit that goal, TaxiStake will increase the revenue split from 75/25% to 65/35%. We believe that these changes will help ensure the long term success of the ShapeShift Cosmos validator, and continue to provide a growing revenue stream for both parties.\n\nLinks to Forum post: \nLink to \n\nSummary:\n\nDAO:\n\nRevenue Split 25% for 3 month term: (November 1, 2022 - January 31, 2023)\nMust create a multisig cosmos wallet address\nDelegates 50% of rewards back to the cosmos validator from the multisig cosmos wallet.\nMarketing agrees to at least 2 postings a month promoting the validator.\nDAO's target (not just marketing) is to increase delegations by 7% (half DAO’s own target growth rate) will trigger an increased revenue split to 35% after 3 months. (note that is approximately 205,518 ATOMs). This will include the potential ICF delegations per the October 29th 2022, application submitted by TaxiStake.\n978,669 current delegations x 7% = 68,506 ATOMs/month for a total of 205,518 additional ATOMs delegated in 3 months.\n\nTaxiStake:\n\n75% Revenue Split for 3 month term: (November 1, 2022 - January 31, 2023)\nRe-delegate some revenue to self-delegation address\nCovers all hosting, maintenance, upgrade costs\nProvides all maintenance, upgrade operations, governance responsibilities\nSends rewards in native ATOM to ShapeShift DAO address",

If anyone is going to host decentralized copies of indexed node data, there needs to be an incentivization structure in place to reward them for their work. Now that Phase 1 of the original FOXChain proposal has been completed, this proposal is being put forth to formalize and fund the development of the new chain based on research of Phase 1 (documented here: https://www.notion.so/shapeshift/FOXChain-0487adc3f52d44a5b74ba40fecddbcf4).  \n\nWe propose to build Arkeo, a proposed new name, to replace the working “FOXChain” name. This new blockchain will be built on the Cosmos-SDK, to solve these problems as has been discussed numerous times in the ShapeShift DAO community since late last year. The purpose of this proposal is to formalize and push forward the development of Arkeo, a very important piece of decentralized infrastructure that will be used both by ShapeShift DAO and the wider crypto world. \n\n2. Abstract - This proposal outlines the second phase of necessary actions to be taken in order to make Arkeo a reality. This second phase will outline the following deliverables to the ShapeShift DAO community: \n\n(1)Building out and launching a functioning testnet based on the technical scope documentation from Phase 1. \n(2)Testing and iteration of the testnet once launched\n(3)Producing mainnet ready code for a functional blockchain upon satisfactory completion of testnet phase.\n(4)Additions and alterations to the Unchained project to support integration with Arkeo.\n\nAdditionally, the DAO will need to ratify the proposed airdrop of the new Arkeo token as well as the new name of the chain “Arkeo”.\n\n3. Motivation - There are several motivations for building Arkeo, but primarily it serves as the long-term decentralized backend for all node data the ShapeShift interface will ever need. Arkeo will act as a service for any application requiring reliable access to a consistent interface to any of the supported blockchains. Applications using this service will benefit from increased dapp development velocity, censorship-resistance, and nakamoto coefficient while also reducing reliance on centralized data sources. The motivation for building and producing this solution has only increased since the project was first conceived and Phase 1 was completed. The issue of fully decentralized interfaces and fully decentralized node data has become even more of a prominent problem across the crypto sphere, and Arkeo is well positioned to become the best solution to this important problem across the entire industry.\n\n4. Specification - In order to move forward on the development of Arkeo, this proposal asks for the creation of a purpose-built workstream and appointing Chad Barraford as its workstream leader. The workstream will deliver on (1), (2), (3), and (4) as defined in the abstract. In more a detailed sense this includes:\n\n(1)Chad will lead an engineering team to construct the code of the Arkeo blockchain and launch a testnet when the code is deemed ready to begin such testing. Chad will have control over his team and budget based on the ShapeShift DAO’s definition of a workstream leader (SCP-92). It is expected that Chad will direct and lead the engineering work with the support of 1-4 other engineers of his choosing, plus support from others in the community as resources allow (such as the FOX Foundation in their mission to decentralize ShapeShift and the engineering workstream if appropriate). Ultimately, these decisions will be left up to Chad and the community will be putting their trust in him to make the best decisions appropriate to build and deliver Arkeo. In addition JonisJon has put forward his support to lead Arkeo on the product and community side to help the Arkeo engineering team as part of the workstream. Mperklin, after being the founder and original workstream leader of this project, will continue to be involved in its development in an active advisory role.\n(2)Once the testnet has been launched, the workstream will lead a community effort among the engineering team working on the project, testnet validators, potential Arkeo consumers/partners, and other community members to run and iterate on the blockchain’s testnet. During this time it is expected there will be somewhere between 2-4 rounds of testnets and iteration on the code as needed. During the testnet phase the engineering workstream and Arkeo workstream will work closely together to make sure that the API exposed by Arkeo is fit for purpose to be consumed by the existing ShapeShift client, as a “straight swap” replacement, in terms of exposed endpoints and performance. As part of this, the engineering workstream will develop a PoC of the ShapeShift interface hooked up to Arkeo, with any necessary assistance from the Arkeo workstream, in order to confirm that Arkeo node data is working as expected. The PoC will be produced and running internally before Arkeo mainnet launches. The proof of concept is meant to be as simple as possible to vet out the end to end data flow using a single chain with no concern for latency or consensus for data validity. \n(3)The workstream will work to produce version 1 of the mainnet Arkeo code based on the learnings from testnet and launch the first version of the mainnet live in production in accordance with the community. The workstream should also deliver documentation and tooling necessary along with mainnet allowing nodes to easily spin up data hosts. With mainnet live, initial distribution of the new Arkeo token and airdrop will commence as the first use cases for ShapeShift and other protocols/DAOs begin to use Arkeo for decentralized node data in production.  \n(4)Work on Unchained will need to be done in order to support the indexing layer of Arkeo. This work will primarily be done by the current ShapeShift DAO engineering workstream who already built and maintained this layer, however there will need to be some coordination with the Arkeo workstream leader with the engineering workstream in order to make sure that any necessary changes are accommodated.\n\nIn addition during the testnet phase, (2) above, the following will be expected to be produced regarding the Client SDK spec:\n\nClient SDK:\n\nLanguages:\nGolang\nPython\nTypeScript\n\nRequirements:\nDocumentation how the Arkeo Client SDK is a drop-in replacement for Infura/Alchemy for the EVM ecosystem\n\nOut of scope:\nClient side consensus, i.e. fetching from multiple Arkeo nodes and comparing responses\n\nA large part of launching Arkeo will include the ShapeShift DAO ratifying the proposed airdrop spec along with this proposal so we are ready to launch to mainnet after sufficient testing is complete. The initial proposed airdrop spec is included here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/165Q0kj-2zqaiU1bg6WBZfKJ0UoxF2M0n9Zf12_R4lyQ/ Please note while this proposal would ratify the allocation for each bucket as well as guidelines for how tokens will be allocated within the buckets, the Arkeo workstream will still need to determine specific decisions within each bucket. By ratifying this spec, the community would be empowering the workstream to make those decisions as long as the buckets and guidelines are adhered to. Rather than basing eligibility on a single snapshot or series of snapshots, which is subject to gaming, the current plan is for airdrop amounts to be calculated using a rolling balance of all applicable token balances starting from the date this proposal passes and ending 30 days prior to mainnet launch, though still subject to potential workstream revision if necessary.\n\nRegarding decisions around the airdrop, the Arkeo Workstream will be limited to specific decisions around the airdrop that relate to:\n\n- Whether or not we require actions to receive the airdrop\n- Whether or not airdrop will be immediately claimable or some portion will vest.\n- If there is vesting, should airdrop recipients be able to delegate and earn yield with their locked tokens\n- How long should airdrop be claimable/decay before being returned to the community treasury\n- If you qualify for multiple buckets should your rewards get multiplied\n- How exactly to technically apply the rolling snapshot described in the proposal\n\nAny other decisions or changes around the airdrop that are not approved in the attached spec via this proposal would require further governance. \n\n\nIn order to deliver on the above Phase 2 Arkeo scope, this proposal requests no further USDC as funding for the moment, as USDC funding is going to be rolled over from phase 1 and from support that has been offered from the FOX foundation. The proposal does however request a proposed team allocation of the new tokens (outlined in the proposed airdrop spec above) which will be allocated by the workstream leader as deemed appropriate among those who contributed in Phase 1 and 2 of Arkeo’s development and will be planned to vest over time after launch of the chain.\n\nA note on the name “Arkeo”, this name is being proposed after careful consideration from the FOXChain team about putting out a brand with staying power across the web3 universe. Anything with block, coin, chain, etc. in the name was considered a non-starter due to the overuse of that type of terminology across the industry. Arkeo (pronounced “ARK-ee-oh”) harkens to the archaeological and archival nature of this new blockchain while at the same time providing a project name that can make the purpose of the chain easily understood with little prior understanding. This is being suggested as the best possible name based on the team’s research and after considering many other alternatives. if anyone in the community wants to suggest what they believe is a better name between now and when this proposal goes to formal vote, please feel free to do so! Assuming this name is accepted by the community, a proposed token symbol will be suggested along with the Arkeo name during the ideation phase of this proposal. Once the proposal is passed and a name finalized, the team will work on putting together branding materials for the new chain. Coinbase Cloud will partner with the Arkeo team to drive co-marketing and branding efforts as detailed in the first FOXChain proposal here: https://forum.shapeshift.com/thread/foxchain-x-coinbase-cloud-support-proposal-40484\n\n5. Benefits - The benefits of this proposal will include the launch of Arkeo, a vital piece of infrastructure needed to decentralize ShapeShift’s backend and also provide the world and other interfaces with essential infrastructure (reliable, incentivized, indexed, blockchain data across many blockchains). In addition to this vital infrastructure, Arkeo will also likely become a significant source of revenue for the DAO over the long term if the project is successful based on the treasury’s proposed allocation in the attached proposed airdrop spec.\n\n6. Drawbacks - The drawbacks of this proposal is that there is no guarantee of success. The DAO will have to trust Chad to diligently put the right people and pieces in place to deliver on the scope laid out in this proposal. It is possible this never gets delivered to a production mainnet. It is also possible that a better solution or other alternative solutions out in the market end up being better suited to solve what Arkeo is trying to solve.\n\n7. Vote - YES - Approve the creation of the Arkeo workstream, approve the proposed airdrop spec and assign Chad as the workstream leader with a mandate to deliver on the scope discussed in this proposal ASAP.\nNO - Do not approve the creation of the Arkeo workstream at this time.",

      "title": "Ideation SCP 112: Governance Voting Enhancement-Shielded Voting",
      "content": "SCP 112: Governance Voting Enhancement-Shielded Voting\n\nSummary\n\nImplement an upgrade to current voting processes.  This would be accomplished by using shielded voting.\n\nAbstract\n\nThis proposal would implement shielded voting for all future governance proposals. Shielded voting is a voting mechanism offered by Snapshot that is deployed on the Shutter Network, using cryptographic thresholds to prevent the front running of votes. Threshold cryptography would enable a group of key holders to create a cryptographic lock that can be opened if a threshold of members (key holders) participate/collaborate. This process would ensure that no one person or group of people would have access to unlock voting results early to potentially influence a proposal. During active proposals shielded voting would encrypt all individual results, only displaying the total amount of voting power that has been deployed.  Once voting as concluded the lock would automatically be removed displaying the detailed results, including who vote for what outcome of the proposal.\n\nMotivation\n\nThe implementation of shielded voting within the DAO would a allow us to maintain transparency in our voting as it is today, but also create a layer of privacy for those members who are voting, to not have their votes shared until the proposal has concluded.  This would also help to elevate the front running of votes, as previously mentions, as well as voting apathy, information asymmetry, and lower participation. Thus, shielded voting could provide non-influenced results in governance, where voting members are encouraged to vote on how their thoughts of the proposal versus the voting power that has been deployed, who has voted, or even being discouraged to vote because of the visual representation that their vote may not matter.\n\nSpecification\n\nIf this proposal passes, shielded voting will be enabled in the ShapeShift DAO’s SnapShot space settings, and a note on shielded voting will be added to the FOX Governance Process. \n\nIn the event that bugs with the beta release of shielded voting cause issues with the governance process, shielded voting may be temporarily disabled until the issues are resolved.\n\nBenefits\n\nThe benefits of shielded voting are simple:\n\n\t1) Increase in privacy during active proposals\n\t2) Less influenced voting\n\t3) Greater participation in governance\n\nDrawbacks\n\nThe Shutter Network acknowledges that the shielded voting system should be considered to be as a beta release.  They cite three specific items that could be risks.  They are as follow:\n\n\t1) The underlying threshold encryption is new and may contain unknown bugs.\n\t2) The infrastructure to communicate the encryption and decryption keys between \t\t\t    Snapshot and Shutter is equally as new.\n\t3) In the initial deployment of the Keyper set (key holders) will not be decentralized.\t\n\nShutter Network also states that due to the way threshold encryption works that there is the possibility that the decryption may fail, but that they take every precaution to avoid this.\n\nVoting\n\nFor/Yes- The community recognized the value of shielded voting and would like to implement\nAgainst/No- The community does not want to implement shielded voting",

      "title": "Ideation Post: [SCP-110]: Cosmos Validator Renewal",
      "content": "TaxiStake would like to continue running a ShapeShift DAO branded validator but based on data from the last year, as specified in the 8 month update https://forum.shapeshift.com/t/cosmos-validator-update-8-months-later/1652 we are proposing the following terms outlined in this proposal.\n\n\nSummary of changes from forum feedback:\n- Drop buy ATOM requirement from the DAO\n- 75/25 up to 65/35 if delegation target hit\n   - Include potential IFC delegation as part of goal \n- DAO handles ATOMs and delegates 50% back to compound\n- On the DAO to setup a multi-sig still  \n- TaxiStake will delegate some ATOM  to the self bonded address. \n\n\nSpecification: \n\nTaxiStake purchased the Cosmos validator from ShapeShift AG (on 09/30/2021), unlike most ShapeShift branded validators, the amount of ATOMs has been on a steady decline. \n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreicyxsydd7elhtwz7lleunxgm3vjo74ztnq525vtm7uq4tfsefb6nu)\n    \n\nWhen we started TaxiStake, we were under the strong impression that “if we build it they will come”, however; over the past year we learned it takes a lot more than a strong brand to achieve success. The profitability of the validator depends heavily on us remaining in the “active set” of the top 175 validators. The ShapeShift DAO is the 45th biggest but over 80% of the total delegations are coming from only a few addresses. Through the past year TaxiStake has developed a strong trust relationship with these large delegators. \n\n\nWhile these delegators support the use of the ShapeShift name for a portion of the revenue split, they have indicated that the biggest reason they delegate to TaxiStake’s validators is not because of the ShapeShift brand or support of the DAO, but because of the availability and the security standards put in place by the TaxiStake team. However, having so few delegators with the majority of the stake on the validator put the validator at risk of falling out of the active set if they were to decide to un-delegate. TaxiStake is proposing the following for both the ShapeShift DAO and TaxiStake to help ensure the validator maintains a solid base of delegated ATOMs while growing overall delegations.\n\n\n\nThe revenue split proposed is 75% to TaxiStake and 25% to ShapeShift DAO for a 3 month period. TaxiStake will delegate some of revenue it earns from the revenue split and re-delegate it back to the “self delegation address.” This will help keep the ShapeShift validator in the active set and signal to the community that ShapeShift is running this validator on the Cosmos chain for the long haul, with “skin in the game.” The rewards from these self-delegated tokens will all be added to the total revenue split. TaxiStake will retain ownership of these delegated ATOMs. TaxiStake will continue to perform all the maintenance, upgrades, monitoring, and governance tasks as is specified in the expiring terms. \n\n\n\nUnder this proposal, the ShapeShift DAO must create a multisig Cosmos address to be controlled by the Treasure Signers (TSes). TaxiStake is requesting that the DAO then re-delegates 50% of the ATOMs it receives in rewards back  from that address to the ShapeShift validator. This is also the address used by TaxiStake to send the DAO its revenue split in the form of native ATOMs.  Receiving ATOMs earned from the DAO's delegations will give the DAO a new income stream, and more options for managing its treasury. \n\n\n\nThe ShapeShift DAO agrees to, at minimum, do bi-monthy promotions/advertising about positive aspects of the ShapeShift DAO branded Cosmos validator. Ideas for topics could be how easy it is to delegate and earn yield using the ShapeShift platform or how delegating to the ShapeShift validator funds further development of Cosmos integration in the platform.\n\nThe DAO is targeting 15% monthly growth rate as specified in the most recent DOA revenue model. https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1z8zHiVuFoDIKHRwKdVY8DAo8WE_LS2jMczBxPHsIRok/edit#gid=0\nIncreasing delegations by half that (7% a month) is adding approximately 68506 ATOMs a month for a total of 205,518 ATOMs in a 3 month period. If the DAO can hit that goal, TaxiStake will increase the revenue split from 75/25% to 65/35%. We believe that these changes will help ensure the long term success of the ShapeShift Cosmos validator, and continue to provide a growing revenue stream for both parties.\n\n\n\nSummary:\n\nDAO:\n\nRevenue Split 25% for 3 month term\nMust create a multisig cosmos wallet address \nDelegates 50% of rewards back to the cosmos validator from the multisig cosmos wallet. \nMarketing agrees to at least 2 postings a month promoting the validator. \nDAO's target (not just marketing) is to increase delegations by 7% (half DAO’s own target growth rate) will trigger an increased revenue split to 35% after 3 months. (note that is approximately 205,518 ATOMs). This will include the potential ICF delegations per the October 29th 2022, application submitted by TaxiStake. \n978,669 current delegations x 7% = 68,506 ATOMs/month for a total of 205,518 additional ATOMs delegated in 3 months. \n\n\n\n\nTaxiStake:\n\n75% Revenue Split for 3 month term\nRe-delegate some revenue to self-delegation address\nCovers all hosting, maintenance, upgrade costs\nProvides all maintenance, upgrade operations, governance responsibilities  \nSends rewards in native ATOM to ShapeShift DAO address\n\n\n\n",

Summary - In order to fully decentralize the backend of ShapeShift, it is vital to have a source of reliable, indexed, and decentralized node data for all chains that are supported by the ShapeShift interface. If anyone is going to host decentralized copies of indexed node data, there needs to be an incentivization structure in place to reward them for their work. Now that Phase 1 of the original FOXChain proposal has been completed, this proposal is being put forth to formalize and fund the development of the new chain based on research of Phase 1 (documented here: https://www.notion.so/shapeshift/FOXChain-0487adc3f52d44a5b74ba40fecddbcf4).  \n\nWe propose to build Arkeo, a proposed new name, to replace the working “FOXChain” name. This new blockchain will be built on the Cosmos-SDK, to solve these problems as has been discussed numerous times in the ShapeShift DAO community since late last year. The purpose of this proposal is to formalize and push forward the development of Arkeo, a very important piece of decentralized infrastructure that will be used both by ShapeShift DAO and the wider crypto world. \n\n2. Abstract - This proposal outlines the second phase of necessary actions to be taken in order to make Arkeo a reality. This second phase will outline the following deliverables to the ShapeShift DAO community: \n\n(1)Building out and launching a functioning testnet based on the technical scope documentation from Phase 1. \n(2)Testing and iteration of the testnet once launched\n(3)Producing mainnet ready code for a functional blockchain upon satisfactory completion of testnet phase.\n(4)Additions and alterations to the Unchained project to support integration with Arkeo.\n\nAdditionally, the DAO will need to ratify the proposed airdrop of the new Arkeo token as well as the new name of the chain “Arkeo”.\n\n3. Motivation - There are several motivations for building Arkeo, but primarily it serves as the long-term decentralized backend for all node data the ShapeShift interface will ever need. Arkeo will act as a service for any application requiring reliable access to a consistent interface to any of the supported blockchains. Applications using this service will benefit from increased dapp development velocity, censorship-resistance, and nakamoto coefficient while also reducing reliance on centralized data sources. The motivation for building and producing this solution has only increased since the project was first conceived and Phase 1 was completed. The issue of fully decentralized interfaces and fully decentralized node data has become even more of a prominent problem across the crypto sphere, and Arkeo is well positioned to become the best solution to this important problem across the entire industry.\n\n4. Specification - In order to move forward on the development of Arkeo, this proposal asks for the creation of a purpose-built workstream and appointing Chad Barraford as its workstream leader. The workstream will deliver on (1), (2), (3), and (4) as defined in the abstract. In more a detailed sense this includes:\n\n(1)Chad will lead an engineering team to construct the code of the Arkeo blockchain and launch a testnet when the code is deemed ready to begin such testing. Chad will have control over his team and budget based on the ShapeShift DAO’s definition of a workstream leader (SCP-92). It is expected that Chad will direct and lead the engineering work with the support of 1-4 other engineers of his choosing, plus support from others in the community as resources allow (such as the FOX Foundation in their mission to decentralize ShapeShift and the engineering workstream if appropriate). Ultimately, these decisions will be left up to Chad and the community will be putting their trust in him to make the best decisions appropriate to build and deliver Arkeo. In addition JonisJon has put forward his support to lead Arkeo on the product and community side to help the Arkeo engineering team as part of the workstream. Mperklin, after being the founder and original workstream leader of this project, will continue to be involved in its development in an active advisory role.\n(2)Once the testnet has been launched, the workstream will lead a community effort among the engineering team working on the project, testnet validators, potential Arkeo consumers/partners, and other community members to run and iterate on the blockchain’s testnet. During this time it is expected there will be somewhere between 2-4 rounds of testnets and iteration on the code as needed. During the testnet phase the engineering workstream and Arkeo workstream will work closely together to make sure that the API exposed by Arkeo is fit for purpose to be consumed by the existing ShapeShift client, as a “straight swap” replacement, in terms of exposed endpoints and performance. As part of this, the engineering workstream will develop a PoC of the ShapeShift interface hooked up to Arkeo, with any necessary assistance from the Arkeo workstream, in order to confirm that Arkeo node data is working as expected. The PoC will be produced and running internally before Arkeo mainnet launches. The proof of concept is meant to be as simple as possible to vet out the end to end data flow using a single chain with no concern for latency or consensus for data validity. \n(3)The workstream will work to produce version 1 of the mainnet Arkeo code based on the learnings from testnet and launch the first version of the mainnet live in production in accordance with the community. The workstream should also deliver documentation and tooling necessary along with mainnet allowing nodes to easily spin up data hosts. With mainnet live, initial distribution of the new Arkeo token and airdrop will commence as the first use cases for ShapeShift and other protocols/DAOs begin to use Arkeo for decentralized node data in production.  \n(4)Work on Unchained will need to be done in order to support the indexing layer of Arkeo. This work will primarily be done by the current ShapeShift DAO engineering workstream who already built and maintained this layer, however there will need to be some coordination with the Arkeo workstream leader with the engineering workstream in order to make sure that any necessary changes are accommodated.\n\nIn addition during the testnet phase, (2) above, the following will be expected to be produced regarding the Client SDK spec:\n\nClient SDK:\n\nLanguages:\nGolang\nPython\nTypeScript\n\nRequirements:\nDocumentation how the Arkeo Client SDK is a drop-in replacement for Infura/Alchemy for the EVM ecosystem\n\nOut of scope:\nClient side consensus, i.e. fetching from multiple Arkeo nodes and comparing responses\n\nA large part of launching Arkeo will include the ShapeShift DAO ratifying the proposed airdrop spec along with this proposal so we are ready to launch to mainnet after sufficient testing is complete. The initial proposed airdrop spec is included here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/165Q0kj-2zqaiU1bg6WBZfKJ0UoxF2M0n9Zf12_R4lyQ/ Please note while this proposal would ratify the allocation for each bucket as well as guidelines for how tokens will be allocated within the buckets, the Arkeo workstream will still need to determine specific decisions within each bucket. By ratifying this spec, the community would be empowering the workstream to make those decisions as long as the buckets and guidelines are adhered to. Rather than basing eligibility on a single snapshot or series of snapshots, which is subject to gaming, the current plan is for airdrop amounts to be calculated using a rolling balance of all applicable token balances starting from the date this proposal passes and ending 30 days prior to mainnet launch, though still subject to potential workstream revision if necessary. Community members are encouraged to propose alternative distributions during the incubation and ideation periods if they wish to see changes.\n\nIn order to deliver on the above Phase 2 Arkeo scope, this proposal requests no further USDC as funding for the moment, as USDC funding is going to be rolled over from phase 1 and from support that has been offered from the FOX foundation. The proposal does however request a proposed team allocation of the new tokens (outlined in the proposed airdrop spec above) which will be allocated by the workstream leader as deemed appropriate among those who contributed in Phase 1 and 2 of Arkeo’s development and will be planned to vest over time after launch of the chain.\n\nA note on the name “Arkeo”, this name is being proposed after careful consideration from the FOXChain team about putting out a brand with staying power across the web3 universe. Anything with block, coin, chain, etc. in the name was considered a non-starter due to the overuse of that type of terminology across the industry. Arkeo (pronounced “ARK-ee-oh”) harkens to the archaeological and archival nature of this new blockchain while at the same time providing a project name that can make the purpose of the chain easily understood with little prior understanding. This is being suggested as the best possible name based on the team’s research and after considering many other alternatives. if anyone in the community wants to suggest what they believe is a better name between now and when this proposal goes to formal vote, please feel free to do so! Assuming this name is accepted by the community, a proposed token symbol will be suggested along with the Arkeo name during the ideation phase of this proposal. Once the proposal is passed and a name finalized, the team will work on putting together branding materials for the new chain. Coinbase Cloud will partner with the Arkeo team to drive co-marketing and branding efforts as detailed in the first FOXChain proposal here: https://forum.shapeshift.com/thread/foxchain-x-coinbase-cloud-support-proposal-40484\n\n5. Benefits - The benefits of this proposal will include the launch of Arkeo, a vital piece of infrastructure needed to decentralize ShapeShift’s backend and also provide the world and other interfaces with essential infrastructure (reliable, incentivized, indexed, blockchain data across many blockchains). In addition to this vital infrastructure, Arkeo will also likely become a significant source of revenue for the DAO over the long term if the project is successful based on the treasury’s proposed allocation in the attached proposed airdrop spec.\n\n6. Drawbacks - The drawbacks of this proposal is that there is no guarantee of success. The DAO will have to trust Chad to diligently put the right people and pieces in place to deliver on the scope laid out in this proposal. It is possible this never gets delivered to a production mainnet. It is also possible that a better solution or other alternative solutions out in the market end up being better suited to solve what Arkeo is trying to solve.\n\n7. Vote - YES - Approve the creation of the Arkeo workstream, approve the proposed airdrop spec and assign Chad as the workstream leader with a mandate to deliver on the scope discussed in this proposal ASAP.\nNO - Do not approve the creation of the Arkeo workstream at this time.",

      "title": "Ideation Post [SCP-109] ETH Denver 2023 Travel Reinbursement and Supplemental Material Costs",
      "content": "Summary: This proposal is the second part of the initial incubation post for [SCP103] which is asking for a total of up to $7,000 USDC for covering costs and reimbursing travel for DAO members who help out at ETH Denver 2023.\n\nLink - https://forum.shapeshift.com/thread/incubation-scp-tbd-sponsor-a-booth-at-eth-denver-2023-40777\n\nPurpose: Get coverage and help non-Denver local foxes with their travel costs related to attending and assisting with the booth at ETH Denver 2023. Also, getting swag and supplemental informational materials for ETH Denver 2023.\n\nCurrently, we will need about 10 people to cover the booth shifts at ETH Denver this coming year. In order to incentive this, I am suggesting that reimburse up to $500 of travel/event-related costs for contributors who work the booth for at least three shifts. This would be a total request of up to $5000. This would be coordinated through PTT verifying receipts of people and working with the multi-sig to send out the reimbursements after ETH Denver by March 15th. If we are able to cover the shifts at the event with locals who don't need the full travel stipend, the remaining funds will stay in the treasury.\n\nlink to sign up - https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1kZ2wXB8R2TwgZlqwy0WCL1IepiE56LJ0jYC2qTOIlXM/edit?usp=sharing\n\nI would also like to request up to $2000 USDC to cover the costs of purchasing event swag(to be determined what exactly, currently working with gray/marketing/global) and updated supplemental materials(stickers, informational cards, etc) for the event. Any unused funds will be returned to the treasury. I will request these funds upfront sent to PTT and he will handle reimbursing contributors who are purchasing these materials for the event. When the event is over and the reimbursements for travel are made, any unused funds of the $2000(minus gas costs) will be returned to the treasury.\n\n\nPros:\nThis will hopefully help with coverage of the booth for ETH Denver 2023 while also allowing for dedicated foxes to be able to come out and experience ETH Denver 2023 as well.\n\n\nCons:\nThe runway is limited and this would cut into it. While it isn't a huge sum, it does cut into the runway and is a cost to the DAO.\n",

      "title": "[SCP-108] - Ratifying a Code of Conduct and Granting the Moderation Workstream Authority to Enforce Its Provisions",
      "content": "Ideation post may be found [here](https://forum.shapeshift.com/thread/snapshot-0x8e41fa5853d8c63d778b8dd8362877ef746ba4620423db12b063e8757293263a?snapshot_id=0x8e41fa5853d8c63d778b8dd8362877ef746ba4620423db12b063e8757293263a).\n\n## Summary\nThe intent of this proposal is to define and formally recognize a Code of Conduct that describes a shared set of expectations for the nature of the interaction between all DAO participants. In addition, this proposal also introduces a set of enforcement guidelines used to address violations of the Code of Conduct and delegates to the Moderation Workstream authority to enforce the Code of Conduct as defined.\n\n## Abstract\nThe success of the ShapeShift DAO is directly dependent on the ability of its members to collaborate effectively via online communication channels. To the aim of maximizing productivity at the DAO, it is reasonable to expect that the interactions between community members are of consistently high quality, but what exactly does “high-quality” mean in this context, and who, if anyone at the DAO, has the authority to curate our discussions? Furthermore, what actions may that trusted party take in situations where some violation of the understood standard of interaction is believed to have occurred? Without clear definitions for the above proposed and agreed upon by the community, no such action can definitely be taken, and concerns about potential detriments to organizational productivity as a result of unclearly defined community expectations are reasonable. To address these concerns, this proposal is introduced with the aim of establishing a formally-defined Code of Conduct, a set of enforcement guidelines to fairly address violations of the Code of Conduct, and formally delegating authority to enforce the Code of Conduct to the Moderation Workstream.\n\n## Motivation\nThere currently exists some ambiguity about the role of the Moderation Workstream in resolving conflicts between DAO participants and the actions that the Moderation Workstream may take during the resolution process. [SCP-39](https://forum.shapeshift.com/thread/scp-39-official-ideation-post-create-community-moderation-workstream-as-an-independent-workstream-40329) established the Moderation Workstream and provided a definition of its mission and success metrics, but is somewhat ambiguous about its intended role in addressing conflicts between community members and does not clearly define a process for doing so. A [Forum Code of Conduct](https://forum.shapeshift.com/thread/forum-guidelines-and-code-of-conduct-40170) was posted previously but has not been formally adopted by the community through governance. Reasonably, DAO participants cannot at the current time be entirely certain about what constitutes a violation of the Code of Conduct, whether the current Code of Conduct may be considered as a binding agreement amongst DAO participants, and whether or not the Moderation Workstream has the authority to enforce the provisions of the Code of Conduct as written.\n\n## Specification\nThe updated Code of Conduct may be found [here](https://www.notion.so/shapeshift/Code-of-Conduct-bb0f06d51bf142329db24db28f5802cf).\n\n## Benefits\nRatifying a code of conduct will provide an objective set of standards that may be used to evaluate the appropriateness of discourse at the DAO. Publishing a document that can be referenced by all which explains in clear language the set of mutual expectations between community members allows all DAO participants to properly orient themselves prior to interacting with the community and for conflicts that may arise between community members to be formally and fairly adjudicated. With the terms defined in the Code of Conduct requiring buy-in from the community through governance, it can reasonably be expected that mutual adherence to the defined terms will ensure that the portion of experience at the DAO related to interaction with other community members will be of consistently high quality. The enforcement policy defined above contains a multi-stage process for addressing violations of the Code of Conduct, which if properly interpreted, ensures that content or DAO participants are only removed in cases where repeated violations have occurred and fair warning has been given by the Moderation Workstream ahead of time.\n\n## Drawbacks\nThe Code of Conduct defined above depends fundamentally on a shared understanding of subjective terms such as “conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate” or “unacceptable behavior.” It is stated as part of this proposal that the responsibility to enforce the Code of Conduct is delegated exclusively to the Moderation Workstream. It is therefore critical that the DAO be able to trust the judgment of a small number of individuals granted authority to enforce the Code above, and that enforcement of the Code of Conduct is carried out appropriately and equally. On the one hand, should the Moderation Workstream be insufficiently attentive to violations of the Code of Conduct, the social/professional environment at the DAO may degrade and as a result become unattractive to both current and future contributors. On the other hand, should the Moderation Workstream be overly aggressive in its application of the enforcement guidelines outlined above, should its understanding of the subjective terms defined in the Code of Conduct depart significantly from that held by the DAO participants in majority, or should it fail to apply the enforcement guidelines to all DAO members fairly and equally, then the DAO incurs a risk of creating an environment that is intolerant to strong differences in opinion, centralizing influence on the governance process, and undermining the power of collective decision-making through free and open public discourse. This is particularly relevant when considering the expressions of dissenting opinions about ideas or individuals at the DAO, which will necessarily be negative in nature.",

[SCP-39](https://forum.shapeshift.com/t/scp-39-official-ideation-post-create-community-moderation-workstream-as-an-independent-workstream/763) established the Moderation Workstream and provided a definition of its mission and success metrics, but is somewhat ambiguous about its intended role in addressing conflicts between community members and does not clearly define a process for doing so. A [Forum Code of Conduct](https://forum.shapeshift.com/t/forum-guidelines-and-code-of-conduct/53) was posted previously but has not been formally adopted by the community through governance. Reasonably, DAO participants cannot at the current time be entirely certain about what constitutes a violation of the Code of Conduct, whether the current Code of Conduct may be considered as a binding agreement amongst DAO participants, and whether or not the Moderation Workstream has the authority to enforce the provisions of the Code of Conduct as written.\n\n# Specification\nThe updated Code of Conduct may be found [here](https://www.notion.so/shapeshift/Code-of-Conduct-bb0f06d51bf142329db24db28f5802cf).\n\n# Benefits\nRatifying a code of conduct will provide an objective set of standards that may be used to evaluate the appropriateness of discourse at the DAO. Publishing a document that can be referenced by all which explains in clear language the set of mutual expectations between community members allows all DAO participants to properly orient themselves prior to interacting with the community and for conflicts that may arise between community members to be formally and fairly adjudicated. With the terms defined in the Code of Conduct requiring buy-in from the community through governance, it can reasonably be expected that mutual adherence to the defined terms will ensure that the portion of experience at the DAO related to interaction with other community members will be of consistently high quality. The enforcement policy defined above contains a multi-stage process for addressing violations of the Code of Conduct, which if properly interpreted, ensures that content or DAO participants are only removed in cases where repeated violations have occurred and fair warning has been given by the Moderation Workstream ahead of time.\n\n# Drawbacks\nThe Code of Conduct defined above depends fundamentally on a shared understanding of subjective terms such as “conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate” or “unacceptable behavior.” It is stated as part of this proposal that the responsibility to enforce the Code of Conduct is delegated exclusively to the Moderation Workstream. It is therefore critical that the DAO be able to trust the judgment of a small number of individuals granted authority to enforce the Code above, and that enforcement of the Code of Conduct is carried out appropriately and equally. On the one hand, should the Moderation Workstream be insufficiently attentive to violations of the Code of Conduct, the social/professional environment at the DAO may degrade and as a result become unattractive to both current and future contributors. On the other hand, should the Moderation Workstream be overly aggressive in its application of the enforcement guidelines outlined above, should its understanding of the subjective terms defined in the Code of Conduct depart significantly from that held by the DAO participants in majority, or should it fail to apply the enforcement guidelines to all DAO members fairly and equally, then the DAO incurs a risk of creating an environment that is intolerant to strong differences in opinion, centralizing influence on the governance process, and undermining the power of collective decision-making through free and open public discourse. This is particularly relevant when considering the expressions of dissenting opinions about ideas or individuals at the DAO, which will necessarily be negative in nature.\n",

This proposal to delegate authority to the Operations Workstream Leader to add or remove delegates to the DAO’s existing Push channel without requiring an additional governance proposal each time. Once appointed, delegates have the ability to send notifications to all of our channel’s subscribers until permission is revoked.\n\n### Abstract\nIf this proposal passes, whoever the community has elected as Operations Workstream Leader (currently @Tyler) will have authority to make requests to the DAO’s multisig to add or remove delegates from the DAO’s Push Channel smart contract. This will negate the current need to pass a governance proposal each time we want to add or remove a delegate. If these powers are ever abused, the community can revoke this authority by passing a subsequent proposal. Further, anyone in the community could still create a proposal to add or remove a delegate.\n\n### Motivation\nThe primary motivation for this proposal is to enable quickly adding and removing delegates from our Push Channel without requiring an official governance proposal each time.\n\nHere are some examples of the first changes I expect we’ll see requested soon after this proposal is ratified:\n\n1. Remove this delegate, which was previously appointed on behalf of the Growth workstream but for which the keys were lost: 0x52b6c397EeAba8bFDe49d7484c1EC33998C5EE35\n\n2. Adding these two delegates for Wherever:\n- ShapeShift Staging comms channel: 0x1c6f97c400a9804A1bB1d7026C77CD7494E78ca5\n- ShapeShift Production comms channel: 0x6193Bc1a8E1610d508e18EF21F4A12b8EFeFE007\n\nFor more information on Wherever, please see the incubation post: https://forum.shapeshift.com/t/appointing-new-epns-delegates/2226\n\n### Specification\nIn order to request adding or removing a delegate from the ShapeShift DAO Push Channel, the Operations Workstream Leader must post a message in the #treasury channel of the DAO’s official Discord (discord.gg/shapeshift) with the respective delegate address. The request will be strong-authed by the multisig signers, who reserve the right to refuse executing the changes if they believe the request to be malicious.\n\n### Benefits\nThis will enable the DAO to add new delegates without requiring a governance proposal which takes a minimum of 11 days to pass. It also enables removing delegates quickly in the event their address is ever compromised.\n\n### Drawbacks\nThe community is placing trust in the Operations Workstream Leader to not abuse this power. In a worst case scenario, if a malicious delegate was appointed, they could send a malicious notification to all subscribers.\n\n### Voting\n\nFor - Grant authority to the Operations Workstream Leader to add or remove delegates from the DAO’s Push Channel\nAgainst - Do not grant authority to the Operations Workstream Leader to add or remove delegates from the DAO’s Push Channel",

      "content": "Summary\n\nThis proposal is a continuation of SCP-69, which created a new sub-DAO called “vFOX” dedicated to making strategic allocations from the DAO’s treasury into early-stage tokenized projects. Specifically, this outlines a six-month extension of the current vFOX Committee, which consists of JonisJon, willyfox, and Kent.\n\nMotivation\n\nIn the current bear market, making strategic allocations is not top of mind. However, these types of market environments are arguably ideal for doing just that; valuations tend to drop with crypto prices, and the pool of entities that can direct funds towards early-stage projects shrinks substantially. Thus, those entities that can still make allocations may find themselves with a.) superior access to b.) more deals, offering c.) better terms.\n\nThis proposal positions vFOX to develop new opportunities in the coming months, extending its work thus far. To date, vFOX’s allocations consist of:\n\n1.) 100,000 USDC and 17,500 FOX into Elastic Swap–a decentralized AMM protocol specifically built for rebasing tokens. Elastic Swap is used by ShapeShift’s FOXy (and soon, Yieldy) staking contracts in order to facilitate their rebasing mechanisms.\n\nDate Completed: 4/29/22\n\nvFOX Allocation: 15,000 TIC. (Current price: $4.46. Current value of holdings: $66,900)\n\n2.) 50,000 USDC into an early-stage project in the crypto gaming space. (While the DAO’s–and vFOX’s–default modes are maximal transparency, this particular project has opted to remain in stealth mode while it prepares for launch.)\n\nDate Completed: 7/29/22\n\nvFOX Allocation: A pro-rata distribution that will be deposited into the sub-DAO treasury after the project launches its token.\n\nSpecification\n\nThis proposal would renew the existing vFOX Committee for another six-month term, beginning on the date of its approval via community governance. Specifically, a “yes” vote would stipulate that the DAO use its VFOX tokens to vote in favor of this extension.\n\nThe three Committee members consider themselves to be highly effective at working with one another, and share a diverse mix of perspectives on strategic allocations and risk management. Combined, they have a deep range of expertise around a wide range of crypto verticals (scaling, DEXes and AMM’s, gaming, NFT’s, etc.) that is useful when assessing potential allocations.\n\nBenefits\n\nA continuation of the current committee would allow vFOX to expand on its work thus far, and position it to develop new opportunities over the next six months. Although the sub-DAO needs to be extremely selective about allocating from the DAO’s limited stablecoin holdings, even relatively small allocations in the current market environment could lead to substantial gains for the DAO in the future. Additionally, vFOX also has the ability to allocate from the DAO’s more extensive FOX holdings.\n\nDrawbacks\n\nThe community may believe that other DAO contributors are a better fit for the vFOX committee. In this case, it may determine that some members–or all members–should be replaced.\n\nIt could also be argued that the DAO should not be allocating any of its limited stablecoin reserves into early-stage projects. A “NO” vote would effectively halt vFOX’s ability to make future allocations unless another Committee was approved.\n\nVOTE\n\nYES: The DAO will use its VFOX to vote in favor of renewing the current vFOX Committee of JonisJon, willyfox, and Kent for another six-month period, beginning on the day this proposal is approved.\n\nNO: Do not renew the Committee as described above.",

Elastic Swap is used by ShapeShift’s FOXy (and soon, Yieldy) staking contracts in order to facilitate their rebasing mechanisms.\n\nDate Completed: 4/29/22\n\nvFOX Allocation: 15,000 TIC. (Current price: $4.46. Current value of holdings: $66,900)\n\n2.) 50,000 USDC into an early-stage project in the crypto gaming space. (While the DAO’s–and vFOX’s–default modes are maximal transparency, this particular project has opted to remain in stealth mode while it prepares for launch.)\n\nDate Completed: 7/29/22\n\nvFOX Allocation: A pro-rata distribution that will be deposited into the sub-DAO treasury after the project launches its token.\n\nSpecification\n\nThis proposal would renew the existing vFOX Committee for another six-month term, beginning on the date of its approval via community governance. Specifically, a “yes” vote would stipulate that the DAO use its VFOX tokens to vote in favor of this extension.\n\nThe three Committee members consider themselves to be highly effective at working with one another, and share a diverse mix of perspectives on strategic allocations and risk management. Combined, they have a deep range of expertise around a wide range of crypto verticals (scaling, DEXes and AMM’s, gaming, NFT’s, etc.) that is useful when assessing potential allocations.\n\nBenefits\n\nA continuation of the current committee would allow vFOX to expand on its work thus far, and position it to develop new opportunities over the next six months. Although the sub-DAO needs to be extremely selective about allocating from the DAO’s limited stablecoin holdings, even relatively small allocations in the current market environment could lead to substantial gains for the DAO in the future. Additionally, vFOX also has the ability to allocate from the DAO’s more extensive FOX holdings.\n\nDrawbacks\n\nThe community may believe that other DAO contributors are a better fit for the vFOX committee. In this case, it may determine that some members–or all members–should be replaced.\n\nIt could also be argued that the DAO should not be allocating any of its limited stablecoin reserves into early-stage projects. A “NO” vote would effectively halt vFOX’s ability to make future allocations unless another Committee was approved.\n\nVOTE\n\nYES: The DAO will use its VFOX to vote in favor of renewing the current vFOX Committee of JonisJon, willyfox, and Kent for another six-month period, beginning on the day this proposal is approved.\n\nNO: Do not renew the Committee as described above.",

      "title": "[SCP-102] Create a new FOX-XDAI Regen Farm to incentivize liquidity on Gnosis Chain",
      "content": "Summary:\nThe proposal is to create a new FOX-XDAI Regen Farm to keep incentivizing liquidity on Gnosis Chain and reward token holders who are supporting the FOX economy.\n\nBased on the results of the ideation poll the params will be the following:\n\nLength of the program: 6 months\nRewards: 750,000 FOX tokens\nSetup fees: 5000 USD worth of FOX + 2% of the rewards (deducted from the 750,000 FOX)\n*Half of the setup fee will be donated to projects on Giveth, half will be kept on the Giveth DAO treasury with no intentions to swap or dump.\n\nAbstract:\nThe FOX-HNY Regen Farm liquidity mining program will finish on October, 2nd. The FOX Regen Farm gives token holders the opportunity to earn rewards for providing liquidity in FOX and Honey and supporting the FOX economy on the Gnosis Chain.\n\nThe first iteration of the program successfully attracted $286,624 USD in FOX liquidity on HoneySwap and incentivized token holders to hodl FOX through the downturn of the market. In the incubation phase of this proposal, the signal is to continue with the Regen Farm program.\n\nHence, this proposal is to create a new FOX Regen Farm for the next 6 months (3rd of October-2nd of April) for the FOX/xDAI pair.\n\nMotivation:\nIncrease the liquidity of the FOX token on Gnosis Chain to keep up with the overall growth of the FOX economy on this chain.\nContinue rewarding both liquidity providing and holding of the FOX token.\nCurrently, there is $286,624 USD in FOX liquidity on HoneySwap, incentivized by the FOX Regen Farm on Gnosis Chain. FOX liquidity and number of holders has grown steadily, reaching a circulating supply of 7,930,246.57 xFOX on 08/24/22 and 1115 token holders. Find here other relevant stats. 1\n\nThis is an effective and tested solution to increase liquidity on the Gnosis Chain, incentivize holding FOX, minimize sell pressure, keep farmers invested in the long term, and require minimal bandwidth from the FOX team.\n\nSpecification:\nIn the incubation & ideation phase of this proposal, there was a signal on the polls to create a new Regen Farm, but paired with XDAI (a stable asset) due to the current market conditions. A stable asset will act as a force towards a stable price ion FOX, that force would be proportional to the liquidity on the pair.\n\nThe vote on the ideation poll showed 750K FOX as the leading option for the rewards. This could presumably increase liquidity on Gnosis 2X. Testing this hypothesis will bring a lot of data to take next steps driven by data. The Giveth team would be able to change the params once the program is running.\n\nGiveth is requesting 5,000 USD in FOX tokens and 2% of the FOX rewards to cover the costs of configuring and deploying the farm contracts. Half of both fees would go to the matching fund project on Giveth and the rest to the DAO treasury, where it could potentially be paired with GIV to provide liquidity to both DAOs)\n\nBenefits:\nGain liquidity by crowdsourcing liquidity from token holders who will pair up FOX & xDAI in a liquidity pool.\nIncentivize holding FOX. Align the incentives of token holders and the DAO with an outstanding investment opportunity (~75% APR).\nStreaming rewards. This favors liquidity providers that want to be exposed to FOX in the long term & keeps them invested in the DAO in the long run by streaming the rewards over a period of time (you choose the length up to December 2026). This also mitigates sell pressure for FOX.\nReady-made UI/UX & development support. All Shapeshift has to do is decide the parameters, supply the reward tokens & be in the loop in coordination with our team.\nTested solution. We already have been using Giveth Regen Farms for the past 6 months and it has worked like a charm.\nBonus: half of the service fees go to donations to fund public goods!\n\nDrawbacks:\nCost. Some of the rewards may be farmed by people not aligned with the FOX economy and dumped. It’s worth mentioning that reward streaming mitigates this drawback.",

      "title": "[SCP-105] Pre-authorization to deploy capital on LaaS-related liquidty decline",
      "content": "This proposal authorizes the ShapeShift DAO to spend up $500,000 worth of stablecoins from its treasury in order to purchase a corresponding amount of FOX on the open market, create a corresponding amount of LP tokens for the FOX Uniswap V2 pool, or some combination thereof. This is a one-time authorization that gives the TMDC the responsibility to determine whether or not to make these purchases, based on specific triggers discussed below.\n\nAbstract\n\nIn late-November 2021, ShapeShift DAO entered into an agreement with Fei Protocol whereby it supplied FOX in return for improved liquidity on decentralized exchanges. This program, which also provided the DAO with TRIBE rewards, was part of Tribe’s “Liquidity-as-a-service” program.\n\nFollowing a hack of Rari Fuse and the onset of perceived regulatory pressures, FEI Labs has proposed winding down the entire FEI protocol. As part of these plans, the TRIBE community is deciding what to do with the various tokens in its treasury–of which the aforementioned 15.3M FOX is included.\n\nThe TRIBE community is currently deliberating on options for what to do with this FOX. It’s possible that the tokens may be distributed on a pro-rata basis to TRIBE holders. Alternatively, the protocol may simply decide to dump all its FOX, or sell them to an OTC buyer at a discount (who in turn may decide to dump them in order to turn a rapid profit). All three scenarios (particularly the two where FOX is quickly dumped on the market) could lead to a rapid diminishment of FOX liquidity on Uniswap.\n\nMotivation & Benefits\n\nThe primary reason for this proposal is to defend the liquidity of FOX on Uniswap V2. Currently there is slightly over 2000 ETH in the FOX/ETH pool. A substantial decline in the available ETH, triggered by a sizable and rapid sale of the FOX currently held by TRIBE, could create a thin market and negatively impact the DAO’s positioning in the broader DeFi space. For instance, high amounts of slippage would make it difficult and capital-inefficient to engage in any exchagne of FOX. This, in turn, could negatively impact both the DAO's operations and the ability of contributors to convert their FOX into other assets. Thus, given ShapeShift’s various positioning in the DeFi ecosystem, it’s arguably important to ensure that sustainable liquidity is maintained on Uniswap.\n\nSpecification\n\nIf this proposal passes, the following steps will be taken:\n\nThe TMDC would be authorized to either a.) purchase, on behalf of the DAO, up to $500,000 worth of FOX on Uniswap V2, b.) deposit up to $500,000 worth of crypto with the corresponding amount of FOX to a liquidity pool on Uniswap (TMDC would have optionality to decide whether to pair with ETH or USDC as well as whether to add liquidity to Uniswap V2 or V3), or c.) some combination of the above, amounting to up to $500,000.\n\nThis action would also be subject to a conditional trigger:\n\nThe amount of ETH in the FOX/ETH Uniswap V2 pool has declined by at least 20% over a rolling 48-hour period, following a sale or distribution of the FOX tokens held in the TRIBE LaaS vault.\n\nThis trigger will help avoid a scenario where the DAO is purchasing FOX tokens due to a broader pullback in crypto prices. The objective of this potential is not to prevent FOX from dropping in price, but rather to bolster its Uniswap liquidity in the event the TRIBE-owned FOX is quickly dumped on the market.\n\nNote that this is a one-time authorization specifically crafted to address the uncertainty around the TRIBE-held FOX. It will be rendered moot if/when the situation with the TRIBE-held FOX is resolved. Also note that this purchase (should it be made) would not count towards the TMDC’s allocation of usable funds. Although the TMDC would determine if and when to make this purchase (should the proposal pass and the conditional trigger be met), it would be doing so on behalf of the DAO and not as part of its regular and ongoing efforts toward managing and diversifying the DAO’s treasury.\n\nThe purchased FOX would be deposited and held in the DAO’s Gnosis Safe treasury.\n\nDrawbacks\n\nThe decision to spend $500,000 from our stablecoin reserves cannot be taken lightly. Given current projections, this would take a month off of our runway, meaning that we’d run out of stables in May 2023, rather than June 2023.\n\nAdditionally, it could be argued that even though it may seem like a good deal now, purchasing FOX in this current market environment is not a smart idea–even considering the liquidity concerns. Should the bear market persist, FOX could drop far below current levels. The DAO already has ample FOX in its treasury, and exchanging stablecoins for a depreciating asset (assuming more market bearishness) is arguably not a smart decision given the DAO’s limited runway.\n\nIt could also be argued that short-term disruptions in liquidity may even out over time due to natural market forces, making this proposed purchase of FOX redundant and/or unnecessary.\n\nLastly, the DAO would arguably be working against its existing program of accumulating stablecoins via Olympus bonds. Buying FOX at a certain price could lead to a “losing trade” scenario in the event it then resumes selling it at a lower price. To quote from a response to this proposal's ideation post:\n\n\"In a way we are now actually paying that “fee” twice. We already paid it once to acquire these stables from previous bond sales, and now we are going to use these stables to buy fox, only to then sell bond at a discount again. This is very capital inefficient and I don’t think it makes sense for the DAO at this point.\"\n\nOne way to deal with this perceived capital inefficiency would be to limit new bond sales in order to offset the amount purchased. This is a potential strategy the TMDC could consider. However, this proposal does not contain the requirement that the DAO limit itself to that specific strategy.\n\nVote\n\nFor:  Authorize the TMDC to a.) purchase, on behalf of the DAO, up to $500,000 worth of FOX on Uniswap V2, b.) deposit up to $500,000 worth of crypto with the corresponding amount of FOX to a liquidity pool on Uniswap (TMDC would have optionality to decide whether to pair with ETH or USDC as well as whether to add liquidity to Uniswap V2 or V3), or c.) some combination of the above, amounting to up to $500,000. This authorization will only apply if the conditional trigger described above has been met.\n\nAgainst: No FOX purchase or LP deposits are authorized.",

      "content": "# Summary\nIn the absence of a Security Workstream the DAO's Responsible Disclosure Program (RDP) created in [SCP-46](https://snapshot.org/#/shapeshiftdao.eth/proposal/0xbba9b00b876633ce4c235729d05fefc51e4829c09b60d1784ee26fabd9f781c2) needs a sustainable path forward to ensure we incentivize security researchers to disclose vulnerabilities that may adversely affect the DAO, token holders, or our community.   [HackenProof](https://hackenproof.com/) provides an affordable, easy to administer, crypto native platform that can fulfill our current needs for a monthly fee of $1,200 USD + 10% of bounty payouts.  If passed this proposal would establish a budget of 75,000 USD/yr for the ongoing administration of the program in addition to bounty payments.\n\n# Motivation\nShapeshift has a long history of taking security seriously. @MrNerdHair established the DAO's RDP in [SCP-46] that is currently without a clear owner or budget after the expiration of the security workstream. In order to continue this program it requires an owner responsible for its administration within the DAO, a budget, and resourcing to ensure its success. \n\n# Specification\nIf passed this proposal would enact the following:\n\n1. Extend the mandate of the Operations Workstream to become the owner of the Responsible Disclosure Program\n2. Establish a budget of 75,000 USD/yr that includes 15,000 USD/yr for on-boarding the DAO to HackenProof and a reserve of up to 60,000 USD/yr for potential RDP payouts. In the event that a disclosure warranted payout beyond this budget, a proposal would be needed to extend the budget beyond this amount. \n\n#### HackenProof\n\nHackenProof provides a simple interface that can be accessed by any number of DAO members. Additionally, they accept crypto for payment of their fees and payouts to researchers.  They are willing to on-board the DAO directly, without an intermediary (IE the foundation). The agreement with them is month-to-month and in the event a new security work-stream is formed, they will have the ability to modify the proposed program. \n\nBelow are some screenshots of their interface:\n\n![Screen Shot 2022-08-31 at 8.00.44 AM|690x442](upload://s6RSoq8QUVxnctEhFKrytLM8N4U.png)\n\n![Screen Shot 2022-08-31 at 8.01.06 AM|690x333](upload://hHwTyOo6eZFZaXsbbCW0DxVzVbb.png)\n\n\n![Screen Shot 2022-08-31 at 8.01.32 AM|690x469](upload://rV9W1ycSe4kyV6gWLax1K97cxQU.png)\n\n#### The Operations Workstream as owner of this program would be responsible for:\n\n1. Setting up and continual maintenance of the RDP in HackenProof\n2. Primary point of contact post triage for new disclosures from HackenProof\n3. Coordinate with DAO workstream's to mitigate open disclosures\n4. Discretion to determine pay out amounts based on inputs from HackenProof\n5. Ensure sufficient funds are allocated to HackenProof's wallets for ongoing maintenance and bounty payouts. \n6. Updating and maintaining all external facing documentation regarding the RDP \n7. Assist the Support workstream to funnel all disclosures to HackenProof for intake. \n8. Reporting program updates back to the DAO community. \n\n# Benefits\n- Clear owner of the DAO's Responsible Disclosure Program\n- Outsourced administration for triage process to top tier firm used widely in the industry. \n- Continues Shapeshift culture regarding the importance of Security. \n\n# Drawbacks\n- 75,000 USD/yr in expenses (~15k to HackenProof, ~60k reserves for potential bounty payout) ",

      "title": "[Ideation] Pre-authorize $500,000 FOX purchase or creation of LP tokens",
      "content": "Please note: the following ideation proposal is a significant modification of this proposal that was previously posted in draft form: https://forum.shapeshift.com/t/draft-proposal-purchase-laas-fox-for-500-000/2187\n\nThis proposal authorizes the ShapeShift DAO to spend up $500,000 worth of stablecoins from its treasury in order to purchase a corresponding amount of FOX on the open market. This is a one-time authorization. The TMDC will determine whether or not to make these purchases, based on specific triggers discussed below. \n\nAbstract\n\nIn late-November 2021, ShapeShift DAO entered into an agreement with Fei Protocol whereby it supplied FOX in return for improved liquidity on decentralized exchanges. This program, which also provided the DAO with TRIBE rewards, was part of Tribe’s “Liquidity-as-a-service” program.\n\nFollowing a hack of Rari Fuse and the onset of perceived regulatory pressures, FEI Labs has proposed winding down the entire FEI protocol. As part of these plans, the TRIBE community is deciding what to do with the various tokens in its treasury–of which the aforementioned 15.3M FOX is included.\n\nThe TRIBE community is currently deliberating on options for what to do with this FOX. It’s possible that the tokens may be distributed on a pro-rata basis to TRIBE holders. Alternatively, the protocol may simply decide to dump all its FOX, or sell them to an OTC buyer at a discount (who in turn may decide to dump them in order to turn a rapid profit). All three scenarios (particularly the two where FOX is quickly dumped on the market) could lead to a rapid diminishment of FOX liquidity on Uniswap.\n\nMotivation & Benefits\n\nThe primary reason for this proposal is to defend the liquidity of FOX on Uniswap V2. Currently there is just under 2150 ETH in the FOX/ETH pool. A substantial decline in the available ETH, triggered by a sizable and rapid sale of the FOX currently held by TRIBE, could create a thin market and negatively impact the DAO’s positioning in the broader DeFi space. Given ShapeShift’s various positioning in the DeFi ecosystem, it’s arguably important to ensure that sustainable liquidity is maintained on Uniswap.\n\nSpecification\n\nIf this proposal passes, the following steps will be taken:\n\nThe TMDC would be authorized to either a.) purchase, on behalf of the DAO, up to $500,000 worth of FOX on Uniswap V2, or b.) pair $500,000 worth of USDC with the corresponding amount of FOX to create new LP tokens, which in turn would be added to the Uniswap FOX/ETH pool. \n\nThis action would also be subject to a conditional trigger:\n\nThe amount of ETH in the FOX/ETH Uniswap V2 pool has declined by at least 20% over a rolling 48-hour period.\n\nThis trigger will help avoid a scenario where the DAO is purchasing FOX tokens due to a broader pullback in crypto prices. The objective of this potential is not to prevent FOX from dropping in price, but rather to bolster its Uniswap liquidity in the event the TRIBE-owned FOX is quickly dumped on the market.\n\nNote that this is a one-time authorization specifically crafted to address the uncertainty around the TRIBE-held FOX. It will be rendered moot if/when the situation with the TRIBE-held FOX is resolved. Also note that this purchase (should it be made) would not count towards the TMDC’s allocation of usable funds. Although the TMDC would determine if and when to make this purchase (should the proposal pass and the conditional trigger be met), it would be doing so on behalf of the DAO and not as part of its regular and ongoing efforts toward managing and diversifying the DAO’s treasury.\n\nThe purchased FOX would be deposited and held in the DAO’s Gnosis Safe treasury.\n\nDrawbacks\n\nThe decision to spend $500,000 from our stablecoin reserves cannot be taken lightly. Given current projections, this would take a month off of our runway, meaning that we’d run out of stables in May 2023, rather than June 2023.\n\nAdditionally, it could be argued that even though it may seem like a good deal now, purchasing FOX in this current market environment is not a smart idea–even considering the liquidity concerns. Should the bear market persist, FOX could drop far below current levels. The DAO already has ample FOX in its treasury, and exchanging stablecoins for a depreciating asset (assuming more market bearishness) is arguably not a smart decision given the DAO’s limited runway.\n\nIt could also be argued that short-term disruptions in liquidity may even out over time due to natural market forces, making this proposed purchase of FOX redundant and/or unnecessary.\n\nLastly, the DAO would arguably be working against its existing program of accumulating stablecoins via Olympus bonds. Buying FOX at a certain price could lead to a “losing trade” scenario in the event it then resumes selling it at a lower price. (Note that the rationale of this proposal is to ensure stable liquidity rather than generate a trading profit).\n\nVote\n\nFor: Authorize the TMDC to either a.) purchase, on the DAO’s behalf, up to $500,000 worth of FOX on Uniswap V2, or b.) pair $500,000 worth of USDC with the corresponding amount of FOX to create new LP tokens, which in turn would be added to the Uniswap FOX/ETH pool.\n\nAgainst: No FOX purchase is authorized.\n\n",

      "title": "[Ideation] Create a new FOX-XDAI Regen Farm to incentivize liquidity on Gnosis Chain",
      "content": "Summary:\nThe proposal is to create a new FOX-XDAI Regen Farm to keep incentivizing liquidity on Gnosis Chain and reward token holders who are supporting the FOX economy.\n\nBased on the results of the ideation poll the params will be the following:\n\nLength of the program: 6 months\nRewards: 750K in FOX tokens\nSetup fees: 5000 FOX + 2% of the rewards (deducted from the 750K)\n*Half of the setup fee will be donated to projects on Giveth, half will be kept on the Giveth DAO treasury with no intentions to swap or dump.\n\nAbstract:\nThe FOX-HNY Regen Farm liquidity mining program will finish on October, 2nd. The FOX Regen Farm gives token holders the opportunity to earn rewards for providing liquidity in FOX and Honey and supporting the FOX economy on the Gnosis Chain.\n\nThe first iteration of the program successfully attracted $286,624 USD in FOX liquidity on HoneySwap and incentivized token holders to hodl FOX through the downturn of the market. In the incubation phase of this proposal, the signal is to continue with the Regen Farm program.\n\nHence, this proposal is to create a new FOX Regen Farm for the next 6 months (3rd of October-2nd of April) for the FOX/xDAI pair.\n\nMotivation:\nIncrease the liquidity of the FOX token on Gnosis Chain to keep up with the overall growth of the FOX economy on this chain.\nContinue rewarding both liquidity providing and holding of the FOX token.\nCurrently, there is $286,624 USD in FOX liquidity on HoneySwap, incentivized by the FOX Regen Farm on Gnosis Chain. FOX liquidity and number of holders has grown steadily, reaching a circulating supply of 7,930,246.57 xFOX on 08/24/22 and 1115 token holders. Find here other relevant stats. 1\n\nThis is an effective and tested solution to increase liquidity on the Gnosis Chain, incentivize holding FOX, minimize sell pressure, keep farmers invested in the long term, and require minimal bandwidth from the FOX team.\n\nSpecification:\nIn the incubation & ideation phase of this proposal, there was a signal on the polls to create a new Regen Farm, but paired with XDAI (a stable asset) due to the current market conditions. A stable asset will act as a force towards a stable price ion FOX, that force would be proportional to the liquidity on the pair.\n\nThe vote on the ideation poll showed 750K as the leading option for the rewards. This could presumably increase liquidity on Gnosis 2X. Testing this hypothesis will bring a lot of data to take next steps driven by data. The Giveth team would be able to change the params once the program is running.\n\nGiveth is requesting 5,000 USD and 2% of the FOX rewards to cover the costs of configuring and deploying the farm contracts. Half of both fees would go to the matching fund project on Giveth and the rest to the DAO treasury, where it could potentially be paired with GIV to provide liquidity to both DAOs)\n\nBenefits:\nGain liquidity by crowdsourcing liquidity from token holders who will pair up FOX & xDAI in a liquidity pool.\nIncentivize holding FOX. Align the incentives of token holders and the DAO with an outstanding investment opportunity (~75% APR).\nStreaming rewards. This favors liquidity providers that want to be exposed to FOX in the long term & keeps them invested in the DAO in the long run by streaming the rewards over a period of time (you choose the length up to December 2026). This also mitigates sell pressure for FOX.\nReady-made UI/UX & development support. All Shapeshift has to do is decide the parameters, supply the reward tokens & be in the loop in coordination with our team.\nTested solution. We already have been using Giveth Regen Farms for the past 6 months and it has worked like a charm.\nBonus: half of the service fees go to donations to fund public goods!\n\nDrawbacks:\nCost. Some of the rewards may be farmed by people not aligned with the FOX economy and dumped. It’s worth mentioning that reward streaming mitigates this drawback.",

      "content": "The following proposal is to get the ShapeShift DAO to sponsor a booth at ETH Denver 2023.\nMotivation: ShapeShift DAO had sponsored and run a fundraiser in 2022, and before that Centralized ShapeShift has been attending and sponsoring ETHDenver for the last 5 years, as this event was in centralized ShapeShift’s own backyard. Now that we are a DAO and decentralized, we should consider many events, but what better way to start this DAO sponsorship theme than through our roots at ETHDenver.\n\nDetails: I have included the sponsorship information packet link here. (link - Public - Google Drive )\nif you cannot access this, let me know and I can share in discord/try to figure it out here.\nIf we were to pay for it now and get the early bird special, we could get the basic Block sponsorship level with the early bird booth upgrade level for $15,000 USDC. This level does not include any speaking opportunities for any DAO, but @willy thinks that due to our connections we could obtain speaking opportunities potentially else wise.\n\nETH Denver Event Sponsorship:\nETH Denver Event Sponsorship Total: $15,000\nView photos from the sponsorship booklet in discourse(or metaforo in a few days)\n\nI believe we will have a follow up proposal for other expenses related to the event, but for right now, this is to just secure our booth and get the early bird specials.\n\nTotal ask:\nThe plan would be for myself(ptt) to get the invoice for the ETH Denver sponsorship and have the DAO treasury pay that directly as to avoid any additional risk involved with the funds.\nThis initial ask is for the payment of an invoice totaling $15,000 USDC. This needs to be done by Sept 30th, 2022 in order to get the sponsorship early bird special which would save the DAO $5,000 to get a booth.\n\nBenefits:\nLast year there were over 12,000 attendees based on numbers I have seen; they are moving to a bigger and better venue so hopefully, there won’t be hour-long lines to get into the building. With more eyes and being at parody, this will be a great opportunity to get people to view and see the new app at parody! I believe the valuable partnerships we gained last year from the event should also help to justify this.\n\nDrawbacks:\nThe ask for $15,000 does take a hit to the runway we currently have been trying to actively extend. Would also be asking for more funds in relation to expenses in the coming months as we get closer to the event.\n\nPOLL:\n\nIn Favor – I support this proposal as is.\nAgainst – I do not think we should spend these funds at this time.",

[HackenProof](https://hackenproof.com/) provides an affordable, easy to administer, crypto native platform that can fulfill our current needs for a monthly fee of $1,200 USD + 10% of bounty payouts.  If passed this proposal would establish a budget of 75,000 USD/yr for the ongoing administration of the program in addition to bounty payments.\n\n# Motivation\nShapeshift has a long history of taking security seriously. @MrNerdHair established the DAO's RDP in [SCP-46] that is currently without a clear owner or budget after the expiration of the security workstream. In order to continue this program it requires an owner responsible for its administration within the DAO, a budget, and resourcing to ensure its success. \n\n# Specification\nIf passed this proposal would enact the following:\n\n1. Extend the mandate of the Operations Workstream to become the owner of the Responsible Disclosure Program\n2. Establish a budget of 75,000 USD/yr that includes 15,000 USD/yr for on-boarding the DAO to HackenProof and a reserve of up to 60,000 USD/yr for potential RDP payouts. In the event that a disclosure warranted payout beyond this budget, a proposal would be needed to extend the budget beyond this amount. \n\n#### HackenProof\n\nHackenProof provides a simple interface that can be accessed by any number of DAO members. Additionally, they accept crypto for payment of their fees and payouts to researchers.  They are willing to on-board the DAO directly, without an intermediary (IE the foundation). The agreement with them is month-to-month and in the event a new security work-stream is formed, they will have the ability to modify the proposed program. \n\nBelow are some screenshots of their interface:\n\n![Screen Shot 2022-08-31 at 8.00.44 AM|690x442](upload://s6RSoq8QUVxnctEhFKrytLM8N4U.png)\n\n![Screen Shot 2022-08-31 at 8.01.06 AM|690x333](upload://hHwTyOo6eZFZaXsbbCW0DxVzVbb.png)\n\n\n![Screen Shot 2022-08-31 at 8.01.32 AM|690x469](upload://rV9W1ycSe4kyV6gWLax1K97cxQU.png)\n\n#### The Operations Workstream as owner of this program would be responsible for:\n\n1. Setting up and continual maintenance of the RDP in HackenProof\n2. Primary point of contact post triage for new disclosures from HackenProof\n3. Coordinate with DAO workstream's to mitigate open disclosures\n4. Discretion to determine pay out amounts based on inputs from HackenProof\n5. Ensure sufficient funds are allocated to HackenProof's wallets for ongoing maintenance and bounty payouts. \n6. Updating and maintaining all external facing documentation regarding the RDP \n7. Assist the Support workstream to funnel all disclosures to HackenProof for intake. \n8. Reporting program updates back to the DAO community. \n\n# Benefits\n- Clear owner of the DAO's Responsible Disclosure Program\n- Outsourced administration for triage process to top tier firm used widely in the industry. \n- Continues Shapeshift culture regarding the importance of Security. \n\n# Drawbacks\n- 75,000 USD/yr in expenses (~15k to HackenProof, ~60k reserves for potential bounty payout) \n\nSnapshot Poll To Follow.\n",

      "content": "Incubation Post Incubation [SCP - TBD] Sponsor a booth at ETH Denver 2023\n\nThe following proposal is to get the ShapeShift DAO to sponsor a booth at ETH Denver 2023.\nMotivation: ShapeShift DAO had sponsored and run a fundraiser in 2022, and before that Centralized ShapeShift has been attending and sponsoring ETHDenver for the last 5 years, as this event was in centralized ShapeShift’s own backyard. Now that we are a DAO and decentralized, we should consider many events, but what better way to start this DAO sponsorship theme than through our roots at ETHDenver.\n\nDetails: I have included the sponsorship information packet link here. (link - Public - Google Drive )\nif you cannot access this, let me know and I can share in discord/try to figure it out here.\nIf we were to pay for it now and get the early bird special, we could get the basic Block sponsorship level with the early bird booth upgrade level for $15,000 USDC. This level does not include any speaking opportunities for any DAO, but @willy thinks that due to our connections we could obtain speaking opportunities potentially else wise.\n\nETH Denver Event Sponsorship:\nETH Denver Event Sponsorship Total: $15,000\nView photos from the sponsorship booklet in discourse(or metaforo in a few days)\n\nI believe we will have a follow up proposal for other expenses related to the event, but for right now, this is to just secure our booth and get the early bird specials.\n\nTotal ask:\nThe plan would be for myself(ptt) to get the invoice for the ETH Denver sponsorship and have the DAO treasury pay that directly as to avoid any additional risk involved with the funds.\nThis initial ask is for the payment of an invoice totaling $15,000 USDC. This needs to be done by Sept 30th, 2022 in order to get the sponsorship early bird special which would save the DAO $5,000 to get a booth.\n\nBenefits:\nLast year there were over 12,000 attendees based on numbers I have seen; they are moving to a bigger and better venue so hopefully, there won’t be hour-long lines to get into the building. With more eyes and being at parody, this will be a great opportunity to get people to view and see the new app at parody! I believe the valuable partnerships we gained last year from the event should also help to justify this.\n\nDrawbacks:\nThe ask for $15,000 does take a hit to the runway we currently have been trying to actively extend. Would also be asking for more funds in relation to expenses in the coming months as we get closer to the event.\n\nPOLL:\n\nIn Favor – I support this proposal as is.\nIn Favor with Changes – I support this proposal if changes are made (Please comment the changes you’d like to see)\nAgainst – I do not think we should spend these funds at this time.",

      "title": "[SCP-101] Migrate Forum and Ideation to Metaforo",
      "content": "[Incubation post](https://forum.shapeshift.com/t/incubation-migrating-forum-and-ideation-to-metaforo/2119)\n\n[Ideation post](https://forum.shapeshift.com/t/scp-101-migrate-forum-and-ideation-to-metaforo/2148)\n\n\n## Summary\n\n\nProposal to migrate the DAO’s current forum and ideation process to a new platform, Metaforo.\n\n## Abstract\n\n\nSince genesis in July 2021, the DAO’s forum has been powered by [Discourse](https://discourse.com/)\n\nDiscourse has served its purpose adequately, but it wasn’t built for DAOs, and it leaves much to be desired.\n\n[Metaforo](https://metaforo.io/) is a new web3-native platform focused on providing the ultimate communication hub for decentralized communities. They offer most of the same functionality as Discourse as well as many features that Discourse doesn’t, including token-weighted voting on polls (aka Ideation) and the ability for the DAO’s treasury to be admin. If this proposal passes, it would override [SCP-97](https://snapshot.org/#/shapeshiftdao.eth/proposal/0xd6bc4cdea7b867cf6c8b87fa203735d0c2e99b66ffcf9b12258ba28a7b009bd9) and migrate Ideation from SnapShot to Metaforo.\n\nCheck out the DAO’s [test Metaforo](https://test.metaforo.io/g/shapeshift) space to get a feel for what our new forum would look like. You’ll see that all of our Discourse content as of a few weeks ago has been migrated, and if you sign in with the same email that you use for Discourse, your forum history will be linked to your Metaforo account.\n\n## Motivation\n\nThe forum and governance process are integral to the DAO’s operation, and since inception we have acknowledged that Discourse would likely not be the ideal long-term solution. We’ve been waiting for a solution like Metaforo to be developed, and their team has delivered. The results from the Incubation poll demonstrated that the community agrees that Metaforo’s current offering is already as good or better than Discourse.\n\n## Specification\n\nIf this proposal passes, the following steps will be taken:\n\n1. Appoint @Giantkin (0xff75E131c711e4310C045317779d39B3B4f718C4) as admin for the ShapeShift Metaforo space, and delegate authority to appoint new moderators to the Moderation Workstream Leader (currently @giantkin)\n2. Appoint the DAO Treasury as the ShapeShift Metaforo space owner (0x90A48D5CF7343B08dA12E067680B4C6dbfE551Be)\n3. Migrate all Discourse content to the ShapeShift Metaforo space\n4. Complete one final round of testing to confirm all foxducks are in a row\n5. Point forum.shapeshift.com to the Metaforo space\n6. Update the governance process to reflect the new Ideation process, which will mimic the prior Ideation process in Discourse but require polls to calculate voting power with SnapShot\n8. DAO it 🚀\n\nOptional: It could also make sense to publish a blog post about the migration and link to the blog post from Metaforo to minimize potential confusion from active forum participants.\n\n## Benefits\n\nQuick comparison of Discourse vs. Metaforo on a few key factors:\n\n**Hosting/storage**: Centralized servers and databases vs. Data is stored on Arweave\n\n**DAO ownership:** No clear path vs. Gnosis Safe can own (ownership is not stored on-chain yet, but Metaforo is committed to full decentralization)\n\n**Token-weighted voting (Ideation!):** No support vs. Supports token-gated polls & calculating voting power with SnapShot Strategies\n\n**Display SnapShot strategies**: No support, forum and governance are fragmented vs. Supported, forum and governance live under one roof\n\n**Sign up options:** Email only vs. Wallet and/or Email\n\n**Cost:** $100/mo on current plan vs. Free! 🔥\n\nAnd this is just what they’ve built in their first few months! Metaforo’s entire [roadmap](https://metaforo.canny.io/) is focused on building the best forum for decentralized communities, and they’re eager to hear our feedback on what to build next.\n\n## Drawbacks\n\n1. Metaforo is a new and innovative platform, and things may break\n2. While all of the content stored on Arweave should be permanently accessible, it could require technical lift to migrate to another forum platform in the future (Metaforo team confirmed that they are working on a tool to easily be able to migrate data from Arweave to other forums)\n3. There are some features that Discourse offers that Metaforo does not yet, such as Recent Topics. Fortunately they have been quick to implement every feature we’ve requested, and Recent Topics should be live before we migrate.\n4. The user experience of Metaforo is similar, but different to Discourse’s. It’s possible some users will be confused by the migration which could decrease forum participation",

      "title": "[SCP-100] Engineering Workstream Budget Renewal September 2022",
      "content": "\n# Proposal to fund the Engineering Workstream, September 2022 - January 2023\n\n# Abstract / Overview\n\nThe ShapeShift DAO relies on the Engineering Workstream to maintain the open source code base, undertake core engineering work to enable new features, support bounties from the broader community, and to provide architectural oversight and technical leadership as we continue to execute the DAO's vision.\n\nThis proposal is to fund the Engineering Workstream's budget from September 1st, 2022 through January 31st, 2023 inclusive.\n\nThis proposal adopts [SCP-92 Definition of Workstream Leader](https://snapshot.org/#/shapeshiftdao.eth/proposal/0x3529a9ab550387d1eedf34d0ba26b5c80ed1c04a74a3c407d9b06a6ea90325ab).\n\n# Motivation\n\n## Previous proposal\n\nThe Engineering workstream came in under budget of the previously approved proposal\n\n* Total labor, infrastructure, and audit spend [~$1,113,000] against an approved [$1,235,000](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18qtCKhBHlZg91bRH054nmabHMaClQO-WdmkM22p9600)\n* Approximately [~$55,000](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1sXPR6xJc3gCmYSAW2N1BpO9Fm5bJJA2ZM492_TkZN2E/edit#gid=558252689) worth of FOX spent on bounties against an approved $175,000.\n\nand delivered additional features not listed in the proposal, including\n\n* EVM abstraction and Avalanche implementation\n* Demo, XDEFI, Tally Ho, Keplr wallets\n* Multi currency support for 20 currencies\n* FOX opportunities page\n* CoWSwap\n* Banxa, Gem, and JunoPay fiat ramps\n* FOX-ETH LP and Farming\n\n## Team\n\n* [0xdef1cafe](https://github.com/0xdef1cafe) - Workstream Leader & Senior Engineer\n* [0xApotheosis](https://github.com/0xApotheosis) - Senior Engineer\n* [gomes](https://github.com/gomesalexandre) - Senior Engineer\n* [kaladinlight](https://github.com/kaladinlight) - Senior Engineer\n\n## Mandate\n\nThis proposal seeks to have the Engineering Workstream be the sole maintainers with discretion over CODEOWNERS, permissions and administrative rights of the [ShapeShift GitHub repository](https://github.com/shapeshift/). The billing account shall be controlled by the Fox Foundation.\n\nThis is to ensure the DAO maintains a high standard of code quality, velocity, reduced regressions, and has a single core team acting as maintainers responsible for the codebase.\n\nThe Engineering Workstream will work with external contributors to ensure contributions can be made expeditiously while not compromising quality, patterns or stability.\n\n## Budget spreadsheet\n\nThe details below expand upon the [budget spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1W5l60lyEMio-bXMo0cscEHQOT6azcGfmc8lqGvFCBSM/).\n\n## Recurring costs\n\n### Labor\n\n* 0xdef1cafe salary reduced $27,000 annually due to market conditions.\n* 0xApotheosis and gomes salary increased by $7,000 and $20,000 respectively to a base of $175,000 to recognize their outstanding commitments and productivity.\n* The cumulative salaries for the team in this proposal is equal to the cumulative salaries in the previous proposal.\n* Any contributor reserves the right to take any portion of salary in FOX and locked varieties thereof.\n\nPlease see below for how $100,000 worth of FOX will be used in a flexible and efficient way via the bounty and trusted community contributor program.\n\n### Infrastructure\n\nIn the spirit of progressive decentralization, the Engineering Workstream pays a managed-services provider, TaxiStake, for infrastructure that powers the entire backend of the open source platform, that will be shared with the upcoming new mobile app.\n\nThe most recently monthly cost was ~$4,800 for all nodes, compute, storage and data transfer.\n\nWe have conservatively provisioned a 100% increase in costs due to additional chain support, largely associated with EVM-based chains, and load increases due to migration of users as legacy products are sunset.\n\nThis budget requests $38,400 USDC for infrastructure costs.\n\n## Non-recurring costs\n\n### Bounties & Trusted Community Contributors\n\nThe bounty program will continue as outlined in the previous Engineering Workstream proposal, and continue to evolve to match engineering and other workstream's needs.\n\nThe development of the Trusted Community Contributors initiative under the bounty budget in the current budget cycle has been a resounding success and will continue. Trusted community contributors established their reputations by outstanding contributions to standard, internally engineering sponsored bounties. They provide estimates for work scoped by product and/or engineering prior to commencing work, seek approval for estimates, record hours against PRs in timesheets, and are paid $80/hour worth of FOX in arrears upon completion of work. This has allowed for tremendous flexibility, velocity, and value for money in developing features.\n\nApproximately ~$55,000 worth of FOX was spent in the previous budget cycle towards bounties and community contributors, equivalent to a single junior engineer on an annualized basis.\n\nSome notable contributions include demo wallet, multi-currency support, additional fiat ramps and abstraction, the FOX Opportunities page, and CoWSwap.\n\nI'd like to personally thank stackedQ, neomaking, and chxash for their brilliant contributions, and look forward to working with them more in the future.\n\n$100,000 worth of FOX is requested to continue to fund and expand the Bounties & Trusted Community Contributors, at the FOX spot price when paid.\n\n### Audits & miscellaneous\n\nThe budget also contains two line items for\n\n* Two contract audits at a cost of $70,000 each based on previous Code4rena audits. It is anticipated audits may be required for Yieldy's as they are developed.\n* $10k discretionary funds which may be used for travel, conferences, retreats etc, at engineering's discretion.\n\nThe line items above are provisional, and any unspent funds will be returned to the DAO.\n\nThis budget seeks approval for the commitment of $150,000 USDC and $100,000 worth of FOX for non-recurring costs.\n\n### Contingency\n\nUnforeseen costs will arise, and 10% of the USDC subtotal is requested accordingly. The budget seeks approval for $45,140 for contingency to be spent judiciously at the workstreams discretion, shall it be required.\n\n### Variance\n\nUnused funds from any budget category will be returned to the DAO at the end of the budget cycle. In the unlikely event that the Engineering Workstream requires more funds, a separate governance proposal shall be raised.\n\n# Deliverables\n\n## Goals\n\nThe Engineering Workstream continues on in spirit from the previously approved proposal.\n\nThe budget spreadsheet contains a list of goals and deliverables the workstream intends to complete during this budget. Detailed breakdowns of each item are available upon request.\n\nThe DAO recognizes that the crypto ecosystem is rapidly evolving and liable to change quickly. The Engineering Workstream reserves the right to add, remove, or reprioritize goals from this list, with the intent to deliver the most valuable and relevant items expediently to the market.\n\nThe product roadmap, externally posted bounties, emerging partnerships, and changes in resourcing are all factors liable to change the scope or prioritization of listed goals, however, broadly speaking, we intend to complete the strategic goals that are currently defined.\n\n## Reporting\n\nThe Engineering Workstream will report progress against these goals via the following methods\n\n* daily public standups\n* availability via Discord, now covering most timezones\n* weekly ops sprint public meetings\n* weekly governance calls\n* the [GitHub Dashboard](https://github.com/orgs/shapeshift/projects/8/)\n* on demand for any specific deliverable\n\nPrevious attempts to report via engineering demos, or transparency and accountability meetings were poorly attended and deemed to be not a valuable use of engineering time.\n\nShould the community request other reasonable forms of reporting they will be considered on their merits.\n\n## Benefits\n\nFundamentally, the DAO delivers a product to increase ease of use of the multi-chain multi-wallet multi-protocol universe that we find ourselves in. It is the Engineering effort that builds our product. We need Engineering in order to thrive. The goals listed above will be delivered.\n\n## Drawbacks\n\nEngineering labor is the most expensive component of the DAO's budget. Any aspect that does not seem appropriate to serve the greater needs of the DAO should be criticized.\n\n# Disclosure\n\nThe author of this proposal, 0xdef1cafe, stands to benefit from it, and is long FOX.\n\n# Vote\n\nFOR: Fund the Engineering Workstream from September 1 2022 to January 31st 2023 for $496,540 USDC and $100,000 worth of FOX, with 0xdef1cafe as the Workstream Leader.\n\nAGAINST: Do not fund the Engineering Workstream beyond August 31st 2022.",

Lindsay, with the support of the entire Marketing Workstream, approached Tyler to step in as interim Workstream Leader in order to prevent the workstream from going leaderless, and to help provide support in admin, organizational structure, task management, KPI and project tracking and development, until such time that a new Workstream leader can be selected and integrated.\n\nMotivation:\n\nThe Marketing Workstream has begun to make strides in capabilities in strategy through tools like Pendo and unlocked permissions and access to other tools that help inform data based, customer inspired decisions around the ShapeShift DAO and product suite. With end dates of the current interim Workstream leader fast approaching, bringing Tyler | ShapeShift in as the new interim workstream leader and extending the Marketing Workstream term to mirror the current Operations Workstream term, provides extended runway for the DAO to help find a new Workstream Leader for Marketing (SCP-91 ends its term on 11/1/22, SCP-94 ends its term on 1/31/23). It provides the workstream with an interim leader with a proven track record in the DAO that can keep the team focused, on task, connected, supported, and paid with little to no disruption to current Marketing operations.\n\nTyler is approaching this with the acknowledgement that Marketing plays an important Operational role within the DAO and needs representation while continuing to search for a talented marketing representative willing to take on the task full time. As the Operations Workstream Leader, his attention to detail, experience in management, and complex procedure and system development will provide interem help in key areas through process and structure. These practices include: cost analysis, budgeting, further development of team agreements, job expectations and descriptions, continuing building workflow procedures and documentation, and finally working to grow and develop data discovery around customer acquisition costs, user metrics, and other frameworks for measuring campaign impacts, press release reach, and other insights. With this acknowledgement, Tyler plans to align with the drafted strategy, outlined by Lindsay and vetted by other workstream leaders, and will communicate and advise actively with the current Marketing Workstream Contributors and DAO community members to address and iterate success into the strategy of Marketing in the DAO.\n\nFinding a replacement for the interim leader will be a top priority, and a committee or group of advisors will be formed to help field candidates, hold interviews, and find a new fulltime Workstream Leader. Having an extended deadline to find the right future workstream leader can provide more assurances to the DAO that we have adequate time to find the perfect fit. If a new Workstream Leader is not selected by the end of the new proposed term limit, a new proposal will be required for renewal of the stream and Interim Workstream Leader.\n\nSpecification\n\nThis proposal addendum identifies Tyler | ShapeShift as the new Interim Marketing Workstream Leader. Tyler will assume all Workstream Leader responsibilities as outlined in [SCP-92] for the Marketing Workstream while continuing his obligations as the Operations Workstream leader, splitting focus and time. There is a strong acknowledgement that this proposal is made more possible by the Operations Workstream contributors stepping up to take on delegated tasks and responsibilities.\n\nThis proposal extends the current Marketing Workstream term to the end of January 2023.\n\nThis proposal will begin a search for a new Marketing Workstream leader to be identified and integrated, and upon transition, Tyler will wind down interim responsibilities and resume full focus back to the Operations Workstream.\n\nBudget\n\nIn order to shore up outstanding obligations outside of the future monthly budget with this transition, there are some line items that have been added to the budget request for this proposal alongside the monthly budget.\n\nThe obligations are 2 line items for press releases that have either already happened or are committed to, the back pay of a contributor from 7/15-8/15, and payment for the rest of the month of August for the contributors- aligning Marketing and Operations to be on the same pay period.\n\nOutstanding Obligations:\n\n\n813×266 55 KB\nThere are also some changes that have been made to the monthly budget that are documented and explained below:\n\nSCP-91:\n\n\n809×261 44.1 KB\nSCP-TBD:\n\n\n811×341 58.3 KB\nNotably, there is no longer a $6,000 bounty line item to pay for misc needs, contributors, and to be used for all press releases and ad spend. The bounty amount has instead been broken down into line items more directly labeled to their actual spend requirements as expressed by previous leadership. There is still a Misc. fund for ad hoc requests, but it is much smaller than the previous bounty line item to rediscover additional unallocated spends. Line items have been added for 2 PR releases a month, 2 campaigns worth of digital ad spend, monthly promotional giveaways, and 2 contributors that were paid out of the bounty funds.\n\nThere is also room for one new hire Marketing Contributor that is currently allocated 100% in USDC. This role would initially be a jack-of-all-trades marketing position that can assist in partnership communication, social campaigns, digital ad and email copy, press release content creation, and more. The hiring process for this role will commence shortly after this proposal passes.\n\nThe proposed budget looks to focus on accountability with continuing metrics around monthly spend that can be compared and related to user analytics while working to offer clarity and actionable data around previous pain points in budgeting that have been highlighted from previous Workstream leaders without a need for contributors providing out of pocket. If this budget proves that additional spend is required, a new proposal backed with data from this proposal’s budget and spending impact will be submitted to the community to meet the budgetary needs in a transparent process.\n\nFor maintaining the responsibilities outlined within this proposal, Tyler will be asking for $5,000 FOX locked for 1 year. This is 1/3 of what was allotted previously for the Workstream Leader and 100% in FOX with a 1 year lock. With Lindsay stepping down at the end of the month but winding down interim leadership responsibilities on the 15th, Tyler will be assuming a seamless transition and have the second half of the month for any complications in transition. This is reflected in pay in the August backpay outlined in the first budget graph.\n\nMonthly Totals:\n\n\n913×259 32.9 KB\nThe monthly spend of the Marketing Workstream would be reduced from $54,400 to $41,100 (25% reduction) with the monthly totals in USDC and FOX being $29,000 and $12,100 respectively. The total spend for this 6 month proposal would be $233,750\n\nBenefits:\n\nThis proposal keeps an interim leader at the helm of the Marketing Workstream that has the full backing and support from this workstream with a proven track record for management and overseeing complicated and complex processes. This also provides support and a longer timeline for finding a fulltime replacement Workstream Leader.\n\nDrawbacks\n\nTyler | ShapeShift will be operating as a Workstream Leader for 2 workstreams for a limited amount of time.",

      "title": "[SCP-96] Proposal to Request Funding for Video Post Production",
      "content": "**Summary**\n\nAmadeus Style, a Blockchain Media House, is requesting $5000 worth of FOX (using the Uniswap price as of the date/time this proposal is approved.) or $5000 USDC to complete a series of 24 videos that we filmed during ETHDenver 2022. These videos are extremely high quality and were shot with multiple cinema cameras with professional audio and lighting. We believe these videos will be rocket fuel for ShapeShift's marketing. (decision of paying in USDC or FOX will be up to the TMDC (treasury management & diversification committee.)\n\n**Abstract**\n\nDuring ETHDenver 2022, Amadeus Style was contracted by ShapeShift to film and edit a considerable amount of videos. These were delivered, paid for, and were very well received by the team and community. Our original proposal ([SPC 82](https://forum.shapeshift.com/t/scp-82-proposal-to-request-funding-for-video-post-production-with-amadeus-style/1505)) to edit the remaining videos had a majority support (88%) but was during the major crypto crash so it didn’t pass quorum. The team wanted us to repost this proposal and this time accept FOX or USDC. This rounds Ideation proposal can be found here [[SCP-96](https://forum.shapeshift.com/t/scp-96-proposal-to-request-funding-for-video-post-production/1719)] with 100% for.\n\nHere is a playlist of all the ETHDenver 2022 ShapeShift videos we've created so far: [Willy - DAO vs LLC | 4k - YouTube](https://youtu.be/y8Vh6_3d7Yc)\n\nHowever, there is a considerable amount of amazing footage gathered at ETHDenver that was outside of the scope of the original contract paid for by Marketing and Growth. This proposal is simply to finish editing the rest of this great footage into usable stories and to deliver these assets to ShapeShift. Note that although these are from ETHDenver, the content and stories resonate well outside of the event itself. These are all very usable through the next 6-12 months and will be a valuable asset for marketing.\n\n**Motivation**\n\nDynamic and engaging video content can be very expensive to produce. Cameras, lighting, audio, logging footage, editing, graphics, etc., are all very costly services to hire out. Currently, we’ve already edited a few videos that were outside of the scope of our last project and we’ve outlined all of the videos that we can create from the remaining footage. Hiring out a new crew to create these videos from scratch could easily cost 5 times the proposed amount. \n\nCompleting these videos will provide ShapeShift with a myriad of content to help build the growing YouTube channel and provide quality content for social media. The videos selected to edit are based on ShapeShift’s current marketing and communication goals.\n\n**Specification**\n\nAmadeus Style will edit and deliver 12 YouTube videos and 12 social media videos to the Creative Services squad, to be used in conjunction with Marketing and Growth to promote the DAO with video content. Files will be organized into Google Drive folders for delivery. A master doc with notes will be provided for getting the content published.\n\nYouTube Videos - Storied\n\nThese videos will include short snippets from all team members’ talks and interviews, edited in order to create a cohesive and compelling argument.\n\n- Decentralization for ShapeShift’s Future - 4 mins \n- Becoming a DAO - 2-3 mins\n- What’s Next For Shapeshift - 2-3 min\n- Working at a DAO - 2-3 mins\n- The ShapeShift Community - 2-3 mins\n- Get involved with a DAO - 2-3 mins\n\nYouTube Videos - Single Interviews\n\nThese are shorter videos for YouTube from individual interviews that form a quick and relevant point, great for sharing more about ShapeShift in a shorter form from a single interviewee.\n\n- What is Tokenomics - 2 mins\n- What is ShapeShift + transitioning into a DAO - 2 mins\n- Advice for DAOs wanting to foster collaboration - 1:15 min\n- Advice if you’re thinking about starting a DAO - 1:15 mins\n- Navigating a Crypto Winter Safely - 1:30 min\n- Engineering direction for Shapeshift DAO - 1min\n\nSocial Media Videos (12)\n\nThese are intended to be highly shareable and even shorter than the YouTube videos listed above. Generally 20-40 second highlight clips from the talks and interviews, formatted for vertical (9:16) video.\n\n- Josh Forman Interview - 2 shorts\n- Josh Forman Talk - 1 short\n- Danielle Talk - 2 shorts\n- Willy Interview - 2 shorts\n- Rotorless Interview\n- How I got involved with SS DAO\n- The Best Part About Working for a DAO\n- Kent Interview\n- What’s next for ShapeShift\n- 0xDeF1Cafe Interview\n- Favorite thing working at the DAO\n- What’s next for ShapeShift\n\n**Drawbacks**\n\nThe only real drawback of passing this proposal is spending money. We think a bigger drawback would be letting this extra footage go unused and spending more later to recreate it. All of this content should be rocket fuel for ShapeShift’s marketing.",

      "title": " [SCP-97] Modifying Ideation Polling",
      "content": "# Summary\n\nOur current forum based polling (that has been a stopgap in the absence of boardroom) does not accurately represent our official snapshot voting where 1 FOX is equivalent to 1 vote. This proposal would move ideation to snapshot to remove this discrepancy and ensure that ideation polling accurately captures token holders sentiment.\n\n# Abstract\n\nOur forum based polling doesn’t ensure voters are FOX holders nor does it have any sybil resistance. In theory, this could be used as a way to manipulate the DAO’s governance process. Forum polls have meant to be a temporary solution that has lasted too long. If passed, this proposal would leverage snapshot voting to mitigate these risks. An ideation post would now include a link to a snapshot vote that is tagged with `[Ideation]` in the title. For example, a title would now read `[SCP-99][Ideation] Modifying Ideation Polling` for an Ideation vote and the official vote would read `[SCP-99] Modifying Ideation Polling`.\n\n# Motivation\n\nIdeation polling should be identical to the final snapshot vote from FOX token holders. Technically, this is the simplest way we can achieve this today. It eliminates the risk of manipulation of our governance process that currently exists with the forum where anyone is able to vote regardless of their FOX holdings and we lack protection from a sybil attack.\n\n# Specification\n\n1. Each ideation post will now include a link to an ideation snapshot vote\n2. This ideation snapshot vote will be tagged with [Ideation] in the title and contain a link back to the forum for the official text of the proposal being voted on to allow for modification during the process\n3. This ideation snapshot vote will be the deciding factor if a proposal goes to the final snapshot voting process\n\n# Benefits\n\nWe will close the risks associated with forum based polling in a simple manner that requires no additional tooling to our DAO stack.\n\n# Drawbacks\n\nThe user experience may be a bit harder for new governance participants and it adds some trivial amount of complexity when creating a new proposal.\n\n# Links\n[Link to Incubation Post and Discussion](https://forum.shapeshift.com/t/scp-tbd-modifying-ideation-polling/1714)",

      "title": "  [SCP 98] Increasing DappBack Funding",
      "content": "# Summary\n\nAfter working with DappBack successfully for two months and seeing significant traction and results from their Level 1 and Level 2 rewards for users in our online presence and engagement, I am requesting additional funding to fund a more interactive “Level 3” on-chain task version of these rewards. With this third level of tasks, users could complete actions such as: “buy and stake FOX on app.shapeshift.com 2” and DappBack would then be able to reward users in FOX Tokens upon verifying the completion of those tasks.\n\n# Motivation\n\nThese added Level 3 rewards will help us to drive more users to the app and encourage user-app interaction (to gather customer data, more user experience insights, and drive revenues). Given the track record of traction vs. resources spent with our current DappBack campaign, we are looking to increase our involvement there.\n\nAs of 07/28/22 our results from this initiative with DappBack were the following:\n\n~11.5k unique users completed our tasks 3\n\n~7k unique users achieved Level 1 and our Level 1 NFT Badge\n\n~1.5k unique users achieved Level 2 and our Level 2 NFT Badge 1\n\n~80k total tasks were verified and rewarded\n\n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreicxeeo5pd4mbd3wt5gsvs5qy5smxh37fxq4puacbywikzkdml77ze)\n    \nNote: ‘completed’ is just users who clicked the CTA to vote on snapshot, and ‘rewarded’ is only users who actually voted.\n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreicxeeo5pd4mbd3wt5gsvs5qy5smxh37fxq4puacbywikzkdml77ze)\n    \n![image](ipfs://bafkreictuuu5d7dzt6uhh3mu5alqgfq25tkxulsaatgeoqvsoanif2z6sm)\n    \nTo get these results, we have spent roughly $2500 USD to date, costing $0.03 per completed task, $0.36 per Level 1 acquisition, $1.67 per Level 2 acquisition.\n\n# Specification\n\nUsers who complete Level 3 tasks will be eligible to receive $7 of FOX on Polygon.\n\nUsers will need to complete at least 3 of the following tasks in order to be eligible for Level 3 rewards:\n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreibu2givfjk25rhdzvakzvwmzlhvlbvgr4mgfmnt3vgn7em34rp2fq)\n    \n# Risks\n\nWith these kinds of incentivization programs, there is always the very real (and well placed) concern of individuals gaming or taking advantage of this system. I believe that we can mitigate this risk (but not completely get rid of it) by doing the following:\n\n1. Requiring users to do at least two (2) transactions on Ethereum Mainnet with our app to claim the reward (i.e., “buy FOX and Stake in our FOXy contract”)\n\n2. Ensuring that the total value of FOX rewards per address is less than the average cost of executing 2 transactions on Ethereum mainnet\n\n3. Through making gas costs the prohibitive factor, we are hoping to reduce the temptation/ability for this reward structure to be gamed unfairly. If we are requiring more/less transactions on Ethereum Mainnet, we can adjust the reward accordingly to prevent it from being gamed.\nCosts\n\n# Financial\n\nI would like to request a budget equal to 10,000 user rewards (i.e., $70k FOX) with a goal of attracting 10k users. I would like to run a series of tests with the first test allocating 1000 rewards on DappBack’s Level 3 (i.e., $7k FOX). Upon the conclusion of this test, we will reserve the right to allocate the rest of the FOX to the same program, a different program that growth believes is ungameable, or to return it to the DAO treasury if no other comparable program seems fit.\n\n# Engineering\n\nListing this as a line item to indicate a “0 cost” on an engineering lift. DappBack will handle the distribution of the FOX Tokens whenever users reach Level 3 and/or 4. They just need a batch transfer of the FOX Token rewards pool we would like to start with and then some extra ETH to cover the fees for distribution. There will be no need for custom contracts or scripts to implement these rewards, and DappBack is ready to launch the on-chain tasks and start driving usage as soon as this proposal passes.\n\n# Benefits\n\nThrough this campaign with Dappback, I am confident we will be able to see substantial increases in app visits, usage, and provide a way to pilot a FOX incentivization program. We will be able to measure direct conversions from Dappback see references and can report the results of this pointing to the community upon completion. Additionally, we will be provided a similar tracking spreadsheet that will be able to be viewed by the community as this campaign progresses一this can be arranged to be posted bi-weekly (or how ever frequent we decide is appropriate).\n\n# Drawbacks\n\nAs we are still in a tumultuous market, $70k is a lot to ask from the treasury given the recent cuts.\n\n# Additional Resources:\n \nWeb Traffic analysis (week of 07/25/22)\n![image](ipfs://bafkreic23wt3u7yck2yhjxi3v45appc3otcq5jbwtawmfn2cm5kx3baddm)\n\nLink to Incubation: Increasing Dappback Funding [SCP TBD] - #6 by hpayne \nhttps://forum.shapeshift.com/t/increasing-dappback-funding-scp-tbd/1722/7\n\nLind to Ideation: Increasing DappBack Funding [SCP 98] \nhttps://forum.shapeshift.com/t/increaing-dappback-funding-scp-98/1879\n\n# Voting\n\n'FOR' supports the allocation of $70,000 of FOX tokens to be allocated towards this project accordingly (outlined above)\n\n'AGAINST' does not support the funding of this initiative",

      "content": "This proposal is to authorize the Treasury Management and Diversification Committee (TMDC) to:\n\n* Advise on the allocation of certain limited assets located within the ShapeShift treasury, amounting to a new total of 180M FOX tokens (current TMDC allocation is 120M FOX tokens)\n\nSummary\n\nThe current Shapeshift DAO treasury’s available holdings of FOX amount to 125 M FOX ([Shapeshift DAO Treasury Zapper Link ](https://zapper.fi/account/0x90A48D5CF7343B08dA12E067680B4C6dbfE551Be))\n\n* Therefore, if this proposal was passed, the FOX within the Shapeshift DAO treasury NOT managed by the TMDC would now amount to ~65M FOX.\n\nSablier stream income to the Shapeshift DAO Treasury amounts to 162.5M Fox streaming through June 2, 2024 (Meaning total DAO Treasury holdings of FOX not managed by the TMDC now and through June 2, 2024 amount to 287.5M FOX)\n\n* If this proposal passed, the FOX within the Shapeshift DAO treasury, including the sablier stream income, would decrease from 287.5M FOX to 227.5M FOX.\n\nThe TMDC was established for a trial period in [SCP-36](https://forum.shapeshift.com/t/scp-36-proposal-for-treasury-management-and-diversification-committee-official-ideation-thread/742/5) in Nov 2021 and subsequently continued on an indefinite basis by [SCP-62](https://forum.shapeshift.com/t/ideation-post-scp-62-proposal-to-continue-the-treasury-management-and-diversification-committee/1097/8) in Feb 2022. [SCP-36](https://forum.shapeshift.com/t/scp-36-proposal-for-treasury-management-and-diversification-committee-official-ideation-thread/742/5) authorized the TMDC to advise over the initial 60M FOX tokens to carry out its mandate. Upon nearing the exhaustion of the initial allotment (60M FOX; SCP-36), [SCP-77](https://forum.shapeshift.com/t/scp-77-ideation-update-to-the-tmdc-mandate/1384) requested a renewed, similar allotment of 60M FOX tokens (with the new total of 120M FOX tokens under TMDC allocation) to carry on its mandates.\n\nThe TMDC may again exhaust its allotment of FOX from [SCP-36](https://forum.shapeshift.com/t/scp-36-proposal-for-treasury-management-and-diversification-committee-official-ideation-thread/742/5) and [SCP-77](https://forum.shapeshift.com/t/scp-77-ideation-update-to-the-tmdc-mandate/1384). Consequently, the TMDC is requesting a renewed, similar allotment of 60M FOX tokens to carry on its mandate. This would bring the amount managed by the TMDC to 180M FOX.\n\nAbstract\n\nIf this proposal is passed, the TMDC will be authorized to advise on the allocation of an additional 60M FOX tokens in the Shapeshift treasury. This would bring the total allocation under TMDC advice to 180M FOX.\n\nMotivation\n\nThis document summarizes the TMDC placements and outcomes since inception [TMDC FOX Allocations - Google Sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1S6p9w08_CJe6vL99j34wyYwC1VJdlY9wj_rGV0i1arQ/edit#gid=1620962441). As can be seen from the “TMDC FoxAllocations” tab, From the TMDC inception (October 2021) to the middle of July 2022, TMDC made placements currently amounting to 86.76M FOX of the 120M FOX allocated.\n\nMost notably, the placement of FOX into the Olympus bond programs has resulted in the following benefits to the DAO:\n\n* $10M in USDC has been accrued since October 2021 through our USDC Olympus bonds,\n* $6M USD equivalent in FOX/ETH LP tokens have been accrued\n* $862k worth of WETH was accrued. Olympus bonds accruing in a similar period, all while at the same time taking action to ensure payroll and operational expenses were met in USDC.\n\nWith 33M FOX of the 120M FOX tokens remaining and available for TMDC management, from SCP-36 and SCP-77, the TMDC is now asking for additional assets to advise placement on. If it is to be able to continue to fulfill its mandate and accrue stablecoins, a new allotment of FOX is needed.\n\nAuthorizing a new allotment of 60M FOX will enable the TMDC to advise on the deployment of the additional tokens to acquire stable coins to meet monthly payments and to build resilience in the DAO treasury.\n\nBenefits\n\n* Continue to stack stablecoins for the Shapeshift DAO treasury\n* Continue to make stablecoin payments\n* Improve TMDC’s ability to manage and create new balanced Defi positions\n\nDrawbacks\n\n* Opportunity costs of asset placements.\n* Not everyone can vote on the allocation/management of the additional 60M FOX\n\nVotes\n\n[/poll]",

      "content": "Summary: This is a proposal to consolidate the ShapeShift Latam & Globalization Workstream into one unified workstream/workflow while funding the new workstream, and establishing @thesmith as workstream leader.\n\nAbstract: Interacting with individuals/communities and expanding to new regions is the path to decentralization, app user/community growth, exchanging experiences and creating structures together. The Global Workstream will build bridges between communities around the world, empowering people and communities who adopt ShapeShift DAO, and furthermore make strategic plans in partnership with DAO leaders/workflows. This means it will operate 100% in line with DAO ethos to communicate with a multilingual global audience, building a broader audience and increasing our potential revenue sources.\n\nVerifiable (and successful) metrics in Portuguese and Spanish:\n\n* On-chain Marketing: Introduced in the early stages of the Latam team, it considered strategies such as Blue Ocean to scale content in social blockchains and promote true brand recognition in a segmented audience, which already speaks our digital language. With a guerrilla bias and little budget, the incursions were successful, today the present team manages tokenized communities:[ Hive Chain in Spanish](https://peakd.com/@foxlatam),[ Odysee Community in Spanish](https://odysee.com/@ShapeShiftDAOLatam:e),[ Odysee Brazil](https://odysee.com/@ShapeShiftDAObr:a),[ Mirror.xyz](https://mirror.xyz/foxbrasil.eth).\n* Social: We are on the surface with a busy[ Brazilian Twitter](https://twitter.com/ShapeShiftDAOBR) which brings important followers/networking and has shown explosive organic growth. Previous strategies have also been successfully applied on[ Linkedin](https://br.linkedin.com/company/shapeshiftdao-brasil).\n* Huge networking in Latin America: We have[ reliable partners in our personal circle](https://cointelegraph.com.br/news/bob-burnquist-launches-educational-project-for-young-people-with-a-focus-on-cryptocurrencies-and-nfts), which keeps ShapeShift at a high level among the big players in Brazil. Our[ experience with logistics and activations ](https://twitter.com/ShapeShift/status/1543067437792460800?s=20&t=NUbsw0CU9cI7ifV-9RI4iw) adds up to decades of work among the leadership of this workstream.\n* Events: Our 2022 event schedule is busy so far, we started at Ethereum Rio as participants and ended up on the[ main stage ](https://images.hive.blog/p/2dk2RRM2dZ8gKjXsrozapsD83FxL3Xbyyi5LFttAhrXxr16mCe4arfLHj5DgBuBNrN8w1wSNwioWakE2HRaKMwK9XrfJJ5AUSmfn8nbmeF3AaHu7SbfujhAo7B8MPVjKfDpqKzGdFeEcAkCPfn1Rfpe2cN875PSGWCYtrTazb8?format=match&mode=fit) speaking about the power of private key. Right after Ethereum Rio we realized that we could sponsor events and an official action was taken on the[ IX Bitcoin in São Paulo](https://forum.shapeshift.com/t/post-event-adventures-in-sao-paulo-shapeshift-dao-ix-bitconf/1478). We are also the core team that organizes[ NFT.rio](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99k1_3wBFQA), the biggest crypto event in Brazil at the moment. ShapeShift was there at $0 cost.

The Global guild has just established a flow to operate Gitlocalize and perform translations at[ app.shapeshift.com](http://app.shapeshift.com/). Read the[ Globalization Gitlocalize framework:](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1m7Zp4G7TvZwzIWJGD2VUtV2FaHRCSeWpDLdne12jvS4/edit#heading=h.9qwpsuv03s1)\n\nMotivation: The goal of creating and maintaining an exceptionally capable and diverse community/contributor-base is essential in the pursuit of increasing app usage and revenue sources while providing value to the entirety of the increasingly globalized economy. As the ShapeShift DAO’s Latam team’s leader, @thesmith has provided not only an ability in providing value in Latam operations, but in expansion and support in Globalization workflow since the inception of the Globalization workstream (@thesmith was one of the first contributors to that workstream, prior to Latam being established by @hunt and @thesmith in a grassroots effort). With @thesmith long-list of value proposition as an individual including but not limited to his professionalism, technical ability/comprehension, energy, and effective marketing efforts, establishing him as the new Globalization Workstream leader will provide unparalleled value addition for ShapeShift DAO and those that work within his workstream.\n\nSpecification: This proposal establishes the Globalization workstream for a term of 6 months starting 15th/august. This proposal passing  governance migrates the Latam team’s current leader (@thesmith) into the position of Globalization Workstream leader while furthermore making @Vladhzc globalization co-leader & @hunt an advisor for the new workstream (for a period of 3 months). Further, this proposal passing provides that the following budget is approved for use by the newly elected Globalization Workstream: [Latam Budget 7/21 - Google Sheets ](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1SkqLKzbDzw_uwUsTkBimP1KPHjQepPUI8HlJLk0c0dc/edit?usp=sharing)\n\nKPIs/Goals:\n\nGrow .com’s traffic in 50% in - at least - two new countries.\n\n* Maintain and promote the social media in Web3 and Web2 that has already been worked on:[ Hive Chain in Spanish](https://peakd.com/@foxlatam),[ Odysee Community in Spanish](https://odysee.com/@ShapeShiftDAOLatam:e),[ Odysee Brazil](https://odysee.com/@ShapeShiftDAObr:a),[ Twitter Brazil](https://twitter.com/ShapeShiftDAOBR).\n* Establish and maintain the Spanish Twitter account. Reach 3k followers on Brazilian Twitter.\n* Maintain the Brazilian Independent Newsletter on[ Mirror.xyz](https://mirror.xyz/foxbrasil.eth) keeping dense content there.\n* Simultaneous work with Marketing boosting ShapeShift’s content in - at least - two different languages. Portuguese and Spanish are masterized, experimenting french.\n* Find translation demands for ShapeShift products and improve communication/information regarding globalization needs/gaps in strategy.\n* Promote internal Bounties using[ Share Platform ](https://joinshare.xyz/onboarding/shapeshift)\n\nBenefits: The team is multidisciplinary, scalable, being able to interact with other WS, flows and projects. It has built a solid network over the last few months with marketing activations, field research - global events have been a core business beyond Discord and social media.\n\nDrawbacks: This workstream will cost the DAO money, however all contributors within the workstream have agreed to take 50%+ of compensation in FOX (between Hedgey FOX and unlocked FOX).\n",

      "content": "Summary\n\nThis proposal is for a continuation of budget funding for another 6 month term, August 1-January 31st, 2023 (Third Term) to the current Operations workstream that was established with the passing of: [[SCP-8]](https://boardroom.io/shapeshift/proposal/cHJvcG9zYWw6c2hhcGVzaGlmdDpkZWZhdWx0OnFtcXVvd211eHNqcnphbTJ2ZmlheGE0N2oxcHk0emdxZTh2aWNkZHZxM3p5b2o=) and extended in a first renewal: [[SCP-59]](https://boardroom.io/shapeshift/proposal/cHJvcG9zYWw6c2hhcGVzaGlmdDpkZWZhdWx0OnFtcjVrMTE5Nm5iNmFrc2h4dGd6a2QxZmp2ejF3d2Z1dDlhcGdoa3oxcGZ4ZGg=)\n\nAbstract\n\nThe Operations workstream is an integral part of the growth and development of healthy systems for reliably producing and maintaining the ShapeShift product suite and its uptime, responsiveness and feature functionality. The workstream additionally provides similar support and structure to the DAO and its ecosystem and networks.\n\nThrough [Production Issue Procedure Best Practices](https://www.notion.so/shapeshift/Prod-Issues-4bbef0cca00c47e4a21a197b960f433b), [Triage and Bounty Management](https://www.notion.so/shapeshift/Triage-and-Bounties-9a20ea5b7e14433c8e434c0f7cc4908e), [Deployment and Regression Testing](https://www.notion.so/shapeshift/Deployment-Testing-Regression-Testing-b7c4cb343f204fc9b23030c7ee9becb2), and [DAO Admin Procedures and Practices](https://www.notion.so/shapeshift/DAO-Admin-7e1f93b3cc354a2aa93276eb85e880cd), the ShapeShift DAO Operations Workstream provides essential resources and tools for efficiency, organization, and overall product and services health that are vital to the success of the DAO, the product suite, it’s contributors, and $FOX token utility.\n\nMotivation\n\nRenewing this workstream will allow Operations to continue to work side by side with other workstreams to increase efficiency in individual procedural processes across the DAO (such as content review with the marketing workstream, bounty management with the KeepKey and Engineering workstreams, etc) and help progress deployment and testing processes while still verifying and maintaining reliability, health, and full functionality of all provided services.\n\nThis allows the Engineering workstream to spend more time building and deploying, the Product workstream to spend more time scoping, designing, and implementing, the C-Mods more C-Mod time, etc… Funding this workstream empowers Operations to continue to complete the above stated goals through our continually developing practices, and organize and provide updates, resources, communication, coordination, documentation and any other needs that may arise from other workstreams, the DAO Community and its processes.\n\nThe Operations workstream is the only workstream focused on the wider picture of the product suite’s uptime, functionality, and overall health. It additionally mirrors that responsibility in the DAO Discord, Github, and Notion by synergizing and coordinating cross-stream collaboration further strengthening the DAO.\n\nSpecification\n\nThe Operations workstream Notion repo can be found [here](https://www.notion.so/shapeshift/Operations-Workstream-808a7f55a83f4dfab17e5edad94eaa93).\n\nOperations maintains:\n\n[Triage tracker](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Ic5l_WoPaRCGLjkzauINcKawhGvMlg8b6kPs6Os95HA/edit#gid=0) and [Triage Report Tracker](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ROkVpiNGWmwIEi4GTtxvyfjGkIgukieQUE_FTKRMHAU/edit#gid=0)\n\n[The ShapeShift Dework Bounties Board](https://app.dework.xyz/shapeshift-dao), Trusted Community Dev timesheets, [Bug Bounty Tracker\n](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1sXPR6xJc3gCmYSAW2N1BpO9Fm5bJJA2ZM492_TkZN2E/edit#gid=1905749398)[2022 Prod Issues](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1MobUqnCtlBqSOW0UERO2i4KMv6z0aJGTA9IcfOl_wU8/edit#gid=0), [Release Stats and testing fees](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qcPHMfWYqDKHClDi6hzeibRAOY3JGXwirGSONFDNhM8/edit#gid=0), [Regression Testing Schedule\n](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JaN0-tXrr_iR0BJ9o4Fkt3N63yPy-P7S08V9v5qfDnI/edit#gid=0)Ops Review in the [Content Production Roadmap\n](https://www.notion.so/shapeshift/Content-Production-Roadmap-45804c9ed4d94470a66a147a49e5067f?v=77bfa7784f2c47c4ba416ddb5cb379ee)[Ops Sprint](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/154gneiUgm3VvUQOEKRuEuftXpdwXbFX7BO0AsH2n5tc/edit#gid=714695737), [Governance Call](https://www.notion.so/shapeshift/Governance-Slides-7dacb3f2d9a7447d8e40823453eca333), AllFox, Unsolved User Problems (bi-weekly) [Go/NoGos](https://www.notion.so/shapeshift/In-Progress-and-Completed-Go-No-Gos-171e9d84ffa34450bdc871b73aca49c3), [Retros](https://www.notion.so/shapeshift/In-Progress-and-Completed-Retros-82a366aaf5184316b4a6a0d2ab284a23)\n\nThe renewal for this workstream and contributors is 6 months, from August 1st 2022 to January 31st 2023. This proposal continues @Tyler | ShapeShift as the workstream leader and @Tshifty @Lych, @PTT, @Neverwas, @wesleygraves, and @MBMaria as Operations Assistants.\n\nBudget ask: $303,831 - $330,000 for 6 months of funding minus $26,169 currently in Colony rolling over.\n\nMonthly USDC: $39,275.00 - 69% of total budget\n\nMonthly FOX: $15,725.00 - 30% of total budget\n\nMonthly total budget: $55,000.00 - USDC and FOX blend\n\n6 month USDC budget: $227,775\n\n6 month FOX budget: $102,225\n\n6 month Total budget: $330,000\n\n[Full budget details ](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1siKv2rPlwOYNfh-iAo97RuNBykESO_BM0U7GXbrYamU/edit#gid=0)\n\nThe changes to the budget from the previous term are quite substantial to try and help the DAO decrease our monthly stable spend and increase our runway in every way possible. The stablecoin spend for the next term is down 50% from the previously passed budget. The USDC and FOX blended full budget is a 28% reduction from the previous budget and Operations now represents 11% of the total monthly DAO stable spend for workstream budgets (measured off of Kent’s most recent runway projections.)\n\nCuts were mostly made across the board to all non-essential categories in favor of keeping passionate and dedicated contributors to help us grind through the bear market. Budget items “Training/Conference/Travel, Technology, and Discretionary” have all been greatly reduced, combined and paired into “Bounty/Other.” This new “Bounty/Other” section is 50% less than the previously allocated $2,000 for bounties themselves. Test Funds have been reduced by 50% and then split 50/50 in USDC/FOX. These reductions were made possible by a dramatic decrease in the cost of gas to execute functions and transactions on the ETH network, and focused improvements in Operations [testing requirements](https://www.notion.so/shapeshift/Test-Funds-a9ef7166f37c45eb8c62cadb2db3c9d8) for triggering a [test that requires a transaction](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qcPHMfWYqDKHClDi6hzeibRAOY3JGXwirGSONFDNhM8/edit#gid=1638058160). All contributors are now additionally taking a portion of their salary in FOX or boosted FOX.\n\nIf network conditions or the price of FOX decreasing dramatically alters or changes Operations ability to perform required deployment and regression testing, an additional proposal addendum for test funds may be proposed.\n\nRollover Budget\n\nThe first term’s FOX and USDC left over in Colony were rolled over into the second term’s budget/management. The unused funds from the two terms combined were then used to cover the complete USDC spend for the last month of the second term (July 2022) saving the DAO $73,925 from our monthly spend. There is currently $26,169 USDC and 52.18 FOX still in the Operations Workstream in Colony. These unused funds from the first and second term will be subtracted from the third term’s first month of USDC and FOX funded to the workstream’s budget. This will bring the total savings from the allotted budget for the first two terms of Operations to $100,094.\n\nTotal budgets for terms one and two combined: $136,400 + $411,000 = 547,400. $100,094 is 18.29% of the total spend budgeted for Ops so far returned back to the DAO.\nAs with the previous proposals, all unused funds will be returned to the DAO treasury or rolled into the next term at the end of the proposed term here, January 31st, 2023.\n\nSpecific Goals and Success Metrics\n\nThe goals and success metrics for the Operations Workstream are broken into two sections in this term, current measurables, and focuses for future KPIs next term.\n\nCurrent Measurables:\n\n[Production Issue Best Practices](https://www.notion.so/shapeshift/Prod-Issues-4bbef0cca00c47e4a21a197b960f433b)\n\nGoals:\n\nTo minimize downtime of the entire product suite.\n\nTo resolve production environment bugs efficiently with minimal disruption to engineering processes, deployment cadences, or user experience.\n\nKPIs:\n\n99% uptime of the product suite and services (99.94% last term)\n\n<8 Production Issue Escalations per Quarter - 5 Escalations in Q2 2022 (Previous KPI was <10)\n\n<50 Total Combined DAO Contributor hours dedicated to Production Issue Resolutions Per Quarter (Q2 2022 - 215 hours)\n\n[Triage Management](https://www.notion.so/shapeshift/Triage-and-Bounties-9a20ea5b7e14433c8e434c0f7cc4908e)\n\nGoals:\n\nTo discover, isolate, navigate, and manage resolutions of user facing issues in all ShapeShift products and services.\n\nTo provide known troubleshooting and mitigation steps for issue reporters and users during the discovery and recreation of triage tickets.\n\nTo mitigate and expedite time required from core contributors spent on bug tickets, issue reports, and production level emergencies.\n\nTo transfer correctly completed and accurate Github tickets of triage bugs to Engineering or Product to be posted for bounty.\n\nKPIs:\n\nGreater than 80% resolution rate goal (91.5% resolution rate last term)\n\n[Deployment and Regression Testing](https://www.notion.so/shapeshift/Deployment-Testing-Regression-Testing-b7c4cb343f204fc9b23030c7ee9becb2)\n\nGoals:\n\nTo catch 95% of prod issues during the deployment testing process.\n\nTo catch user facing issues in production environments in regression tests and #triage them accordingly.\n\nA deployment test is completed by the Operations Workstream during each release process and upon request in pre-deployment branch testing.\n\nSpecific regression tests are performed once a day by an Operations Workstream contributor to complete a full monthly regression testing schedule in accordance with regression testing best practices.\n\nOperations prioritize blocking bugs, supporting engineers, and efficiency in the processes already in place over chasing non-blocking bugs for a ‘perfected’ release.\n\nKPIs:\n\n<2 Cadences missed per quarter due to bugs overlooked in Ops Testing (0 cadence missed last term)\n\n<2 Rollbacks during releases per quarter due to bugs overlooked in Ops Testing (0 Rollbacks occurred last term)\n\n[DAO Admin Procedures and Practices](https://www.notion.so/shapeshift/DAO-Admin-7e1f93b3cc354a2aa93276eb85e880cd)\n\nGoals:\n\nTo organize successful DAO meetings related to Goat/No Goat, Retros, Ops Sprints, and AllFoxes.\n\nTo track, organize, record, and optimize DAO repos keeping them current and relevant. To help in cross workstream collaboration projects that optimize efficiency and collaborative, transparent communication.\n\nTo provide assistance in projects that require support in generating procedures to be completed for the DAO or other workstreams.\n\nKPIs: (New this term)\n\n72 hour max response time for all PR review requests from Marketing in the Content Production Roadmap.\n\nKeep All Workstream leaders and key contributors informed and involved in contributions to all Ops Sprints, Governance Calls, AllFoxes Slide decks, Go/No Gos, and Retros.\n\nProvide full bounty insights to build future goals of % or # of tickets bountied per week.\n\nBenefits:\n\nIf this proposal passes, the DAO will continue to fund the Operations workstream budget to meet the deliverables and services outlined which are integral to the DAO’s success and current practices. Coverage for Prod Issue escalations Triage Management Regularly scheduled regression and deployment testing Cross workstream alignment and stakeholder resources would all be focused, maintained and improved upon by the workstream.\n\nPassing this proposal will continue uninterrupted support and services offered from the Operations workstream to the DAO.\n\nDrawbacks:\n\nFunding this workstream costs the DAO stablecoins and FOX during the duration of the proposed term. This workstream would cost the DAO treasury potentially $330,000 over 6 months (~$55,000/month) if all funds are needed and exhausted in the budget.\n\nVote:\n\nFor: You support funding the Operations Workstream’s anticipated budget for 6 months, totaling a potential $301,609 to the DAO, and continuing the roles, responsibilities, and expectations outlined above in the Operations Workstream during that time.\n\nAgainst: You do not support continuing to fund the Operations Workstream.",

      "content": "# Summary\n\nThis proposal clearly defines a Workstream Leader.\n\n# Abstract\n\nThis proposal explicitly defines the roles, responsibilities, and authority of a Workstream Leader, as it relates to\n\n* A workstream requiring a single leader\n* The authority to hire and fire within a workstream\n* Discretion over the allocation of a budget approved by governance\n\nShould this proposal pass, it will take effect after 14 days, and apply to all workstreams without a passed superseding proposal.\n\nCurrent workstreams with multiple leaders are encouraged to expediently elect a single leader and adopt this definition via a separate proposal specific to their workstream.\n\nFuture proposals that create, renew, or amend workstreams will adopt this definition of a Workstream Leader by default unless explicitly defined otherwise.\n\n# Motivation\n\nThere is not an explicit definition of a Workstream Leader as approved by governance.\n\nThis proposal seeks to formalize an agreed upon definition of a Workstream Leader, including roles, responsibilities, and authority.\n\nResourcing and budget are intrinsically linked. A Workstream Leader cannot control one without the other.\n\nA single Workstream Leader is proposed as a clear, effective, and familiar way to mitigate complexities that can arise with multiple Workstream Leaders related to responsibility, accountability, and conflict resolution.\n\n# Specification\n\n## Single Workstream Leader\n\nA workstream shall have a single Workstream Leader.\n\nThe Workstream Leader shall be responsible for the direction, resourcing, budget, performance, deliverables, communication, and representation of the workstream.\n\nThe Workstream Leader may only be changed via governance. In the event of a sudden or emergency departure of a Workstream Leader, a Workstream Leader may appoint an Interim Workstream Leader by a forum post, which shall immediately follow the standard governance process.\n\n## Resourcing\n\nThe Workstream Leader shall be delegated the authority by governance to make decisions pertaining to resourcing, that is, how the funds allocated to the workstream are used to provide the services and meet proposed goals, including hiring and firing of workstream contributors.\n\n## Budget\n\nA budget is an estimate of income and expenditure for a set period of time.\n\nThe Workstream Leader shall be delegated the authority by governance to have full discretion over how an approved budget is spent.\n\nThe Workstream Leader shall not be able to spend more than the approved budget by a proposal, without a proposal to amend said proposal.\n\nWorkstream proposals must include timephased budget estimates broken down by each month of their proposed cycle (e.g. $15,000 July, $10,000 August, etc.).\n\nThe Workstream Leader shall be responsible for coordinating with DAO treasury multi-sig signers to ensure sufficient funds are made available in Colony to ensure expenses can be paid monthly or on-demand.\n\n# Benefits\n\nAn explicitly defined and shared understanding of how workstreams and their leaders operate will remove the ambiguity that currently exists within the DAO.\n\nWithout a defined and granted delegated authority - a Workstream Leader is unable to lead. The leader role becomes that of a secretary, coordinator or spokesperson.\n\n# Drawbacks\n\nThere could exist a perceived centralization risk that arises from delegating authority to Workstream Leaders.\n\nThis is mitigated by the following\n\n* Delegated authority is well defined and scoped to an individual workstream.\n* A Workstream Leader can be removed via a governance proposal at any time.\n* A Workstream Leader’s term is always limited and thus up for renewal and potential replacement at the end of any given term.",

      "title": "[SCP-90] Fund the Tokenomics Workstream in Q3/Q4",
      "content": "SUMMARY:\n\nThe most recently-approved phase of the Tokenomics Workstream ended on June 30, 2022. This proposal outlines the scope and budget for the following six months, through the end of 2022.\n\nTHE PRIMARY GOAL FOR THE SECOND HALF OF 2022:\n\nPreserve and extend our runway\n\nThe paramount, number-one goal of Tokenomics in Q3/Q4 is to help ensure that the DAO remains financially solvent for as long as possible. There are a handful of core tools we have at our disposal to make this happen:\n\na.) An updated and accurate view of how much runway we have remaining.\n\nThis is being tracked by the DAO Runway Spreadsheet I’ve created, which factors in our current stablecoin reserves (all visible on-chain or via the DAOshboard), our monthly budgetary outlay, and debt service expenses.\n\nb.) Our Olympus FOX/USDC bonds\n\nc.) Selling FOX on the open market\n\nd.) Other tools, such as Hedgey OTC or Porter bonds\n\ne.) Budget austerity\n\nIn the wake of the violent downswing in both FOX and the broader crypto market, various Workstream Leaders have reacted by enacting or proposing budget cuts. While this is not a fun step to take, we’re in good company; many crypto projects and companies, big and small, are taking similar steps. While the Tokenomics Workstream has no ability (and no desire) to tell other Workstreams what to do with their budgets, it can still play a helpful role in modeling various scenarios, providing timely updates on the status of our finances, and offering advice on how to move forward.\n\nNote that this section lacks a specific stablecoin goal, like the Q2 proposal. I hesitate to shoot for a specific target because: a.) the community has expressed discomfort at the idea, and b.) it’s difficult to advocate for a specific amount of stablecoin accrual in this highly depressed market, where liquidity has dried up and buyers are harder to find. Additionally, the community currently seems divided on whether we should continue to accrue stablecoins or simply make our stand with our current warchest. (I, for one, am strongly in favor of continued stablecoin accrual).\n\nThat said, 18 months of runway remains a good goal to shoot for–albeit an aggressive one in this bear market. It may be possible to get there through a combination of the tools described above–for instance, FOX bonds combined with monthly budget reductions. This would be much more feasible if FOX sees a sustained increase in price at some point.\n\nA more conservative goal is to aim for the DAO to raise enough stablecoin income each month to pay for its monthly expenses. 10 months of runway is perfectly feasible over the long-run if we rein in our budget and increase our stablecoin income.\n\nADDITIONAL GOALS\n\nBuild upon the existing DAOshboard\n\nNow that it’s created, what else can be done?\n\nThe logical next steps are to create ways to more easily visualize this data, detect trends, and suss out information and conclusions that could be beneficial from a strategic intelligence standpoint.\n\nContribute to new value-accrual mechanisms.\n\nReprising this goal from last quarter is an easy choice. In Q2 the focus was on FOXy. This time around, we have Yieldies to champion. This new financial primitive is concurrently moving though the audit and governance processes. Upon its release, the Tokenomics Workstream (along with the TMDC) will provide feedback and input on its strategies and parameters.\n\nThe next few quarters will also be a great time to assess new business strategies. Bear markets provide a few silver linings, and this is one of them: an opportunity to sit back and calmly assess what’s working, what’s not, and how to build back better for the next cyclical upswing.\n\nContinue to increase awareness of the DAO.\n\nI already have some potential opportunities lined up for spreading the word via articles, podcasts, and other avenues. With the assistance of our expert PR team, I look forward to continuing to help on this front.\n\nBUDGET STUFF:\n\nWorkstream Leader Compensation\n\nThe Q2 proposal included a 14,000 USDC/month Workstream Leader salary–an amount commensurate with other Workstream Leaders.\n\nThis new proposal stipulates that the Tokenomics Workstream Leader will instead receive $14,000 worth of FOX each month. This will help to reduce our monthly stablecoin spend. Additionally, by going “Full FOX” I want to signal my own deeply-held belief that we’ll survive this bear market, find a lasting product-market fit, and wind up in a much stronger position than we currently are. It’s my sincere belief that WAGMI.\n\nIn order to allay any concerns about the FOX immediately being converted and dumped on the open market, this proposal also stipulates that these payments will be made via Boosted FOX, with a 12-month timelock. Per the Boosted FOX proposal, this option provides an extra 20% of FOX following the end of the timelock period. (In the unlikely event that there’s a technical issue preventing Boosted FOX payments from being made, payment will default to regular, non-timelocked FOX.)\n\nFunding for Workstream projects and bounties\n\nIn Q2, the Tokenomics Workstream spent a total of 17,681 USDC. These expenses included DAO contributor compensation for their work on the DAOshboard, an analysis of our Ichi AngelVault, and the Boosted FOX proposal. The largest expense (roughly 14,000 USDC) was for an audit of the Yieldy smart contracts.\n\nThe Workstream currently has 32,000 USDC, of which 25,000 has been earmarked for the completion of the Yieldy smart contract code. That payment will leave us with 7,000 USDC for Q3/Q4. This proposal requests an additional funding of 13,000 USDC, payable up-front (concurrent with July payroll), which will provide the Workstream with 20,000 USDC to spend in Q3/Q4. These funds could be spent on all manner of projects, from code reviews to detailed financial analysis to in-depth audits of projects that are seeking to partner with the DAO.\n\nPOTENTIAL DRAWBACKS OF THIS PROPOSAL:\n\nImagine a ShapeShift DAO where there was only an unofficial, non-funded, Tokenomics Workstream. In this scenario, a lot of meaningful work would still get done; the TMDC would still function (its budget is not a subset of Tokenomics), and contributors could still find myriad ways to collaborate–all without needing to spend funds from the DAO treasury on Tokenomics functionality or leadership.\n\nWHAT THIS VOTE DOES:\n\nFor the period of July 1st, 2022 through December 31st, 2022:\n\n1.) Fund the Tokenomics Workstream with a one-time distribution of 13,000 USDC (payable in July) and a monthly Workstream Leader salary of $14,000 worth of FOX (payable in 12-month-timelock Boosted FOX).\n\n2.) Re-elect Kent as the Tokenomics Workstream Leader.",

      "title": "[SCP-91] Proposal to consolidate current Marketing, Growth & Globalization Workstream",
      "content": "**Summary:**\n\nThis proposal aims to reorganize the Marketing & Growth workstream and create the separation of Globalization & LatAm (proposal to come from @thesmith) while reducing the workstream budget. The primary change is transferring leadership of Marketing & Growth from ( @hunt ) & ( @Toasty) over to (@Lindsaylou). @Lindsaylou will be interim workstream leader until September 1st. During this time Growth and Marketing Workstream will utilize this proposal to readjust and lower its budget in accordance with the DAO’s general initiative to cut costs during poor market conditions and maximize resiliency.\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nThis proposal will cover the change of hands for leadership of the Marketing & Growth Workstream. @hunt will be leaving as a workstream leader, and @Lindsaylou will be assuming the interim role of leadership until September 1st, at which time (or before) a new Marketing & Growth workstream leader will be appointed.\n\nThe proposal will also include the separation of LatAm/Globalization, who will be creating their own proposal at a later date establishing them as their own workstream potentially led by @thesmith. The Marketing & Growth Workstream will include an extra month of budget for the globalization team (August 2022) if their workstream fails to be established by September 1, 2022, at which point the separation of this team will still occur.\n\nI, @Toasty, & @hunt will be stepping down as the workstream’s current leader and handing the role of Workstream Leader to @Lindsaylou. Going forward, I will be reducing my role to interim Marketing PM for 1 month to assist her in leadership transition, but the ability to remain on is at the discretion of the new Workstream Leader @Lindsaylou. @hunt will be moved over to a role on the Globalization team which will be up to the future workstream’s discretion going forward.\n\nBudget and goals will also be changing on the Marketing & Growth Workstream. Reduction of budget and staff have been made to account for the current market condition and to extend the runway for the DAO. Here is a [link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tKNbu1_2nl6_Cmq3GjvVR__v8_wtuAlkmQimedzQF8w/edit#gid=447901141 to the New M&G Budget 5, which will be a reduction down to a total of $54,355 in a blend of USDC & FOX Tokens with the potential of $87,605 for August. The budget will comprise $30,205 of USDC per month (considerably below the ask of ($60K USDC per month) and $24,150 worth of FOX Tokens per month. This budget also contains a tab for 1 month coverage of the Globalization & LatAm team if it were not to establish itself as a new workstream by the end of the month, which contains $9,375 of USDC and $23,875 worth of FOX.\n\nNew goals/ KPIs will be shared with the community within a 30-day window publicly to the community via forum by the new workstream leader (@Lindsaylou). Budget control will also become a responsibility of the new workstream leader to be altered but not increased (without a new proposal) at their discretion.\n\nThese changes would take effect 5 days after passing (no later than Aug 1, 2022) & remain in effect for the remaining term of the current Marketing & Growth Workstream (Nov 1, 2022) and at the discretion of the new proposed leaders and the community to renew at that time.\n\n**Motivation:**\n\nThe goal of these changes is to establish a new singular Workstream Leader that can run Marketing & Growth on a far more conservative budget with a focused team.\n\nGlobalization & LatAm will be removed from the workstream to establish their own if they so choose while fulfilling the objective above to reduce overall budgetary spend for Marketing & Growth as well as a team size reduction. The community at large will be in a better position to judge the ongoing merits of smaller teams.\n\n**Benefits:**\n\n-Reduction in Marketing & Growth from $126,300 to $54,355 (Potentially $33,250 extra for 1 month)\n\n-Decrease stable coin payouts with the new proposed budget (55% in FOX and 45% in USDC)\n\n-Singular leader instead of co-leads for greater accountability\n\n-Removal of the Globalization & LatAm team so they can proceed to create their own workstream.\n\n**Drawbacks:**\n\nThe workstream will be going through a transitory stage likely with reduced output as the separation occurs into two workstreams. Smaller teams may mean tough choices in projects they can undertake.",

      "title": "Renew Moderation Workstream July - End of Dec 2022",
      "content": "Workstream Renewal\n\nSummary\nThe Community Moderation Workstream is primarily responsible to support the\ncommunity and to maintain the integrity of all ShapeShift various platforms such as\nDiscord, The Forum, Boardroom and Notion. Future platforms that the community\nchooses to implement may also be included. This workstream is used daily to ensure\nthe smooth operation of the ShapeShift DAO.\nThis proposal is to renew the Moderation Workstream, re-elect Giantkin as leader and\nfund the workstream through the end of December 2022.\n\nAbstract\nModeration supports all workstreams and all users within each of the platforms it\nmoderates. As we bring more members into the various platforms, moderators act as so\nmuch more than bot managers and spam blockers. Not only do the moderators set up\nthe verification process, they are the point of contact for members having issues with\nthe verification process. They function as the greeters of the DAO, if you will. Our team\nof moderators clears the path for new members, new contributors and new supporters\nby facilitating a fluid user experience. Enthusiastic about all things defi and crypto,\nempowering community members, new and old alike, on their journey to selfempowered entrepreneurism.\n\nMotivation\nThe mission of this workstream is simple: to help people. Moderation is the workstream\nyou never knew you needed, but couldn’t live without. From welcoming new users to\nsetting up Zoom calls to managing bots. Moderation is here to support the community.\nThis workstream strives to create a space that fosters security, growth and innovation.\nOur team of trustworthy, confident and enthusiastic moderators allows for\ndecentralization of community moderation. This may address the point of preventing\naccusations of vested interest, since only community elected mods have the power to\npreserve and maintain the DAO culture.\n2022 July-Dec Moderation Workstream Renewal \n\nAs the workstream leader, I want to make the user feel like they are able to relax. Users\nare most likely talking from their home space, home usually means they feel safe. I want\nto keep that feeling in our group.\n\nSpecification\nModerators take on wide variety of tasks, including but not limited to:\nOrganize user flow via roles, channels and bots\nCreate and maintain scheduled events in sesh & Discord\nProvide protection from scammers\nWarn abusers (strike system established by Giantkin)\nProviding Discord support\nFacilitating ‘temps’ for a job, for example, providing the DJ with a role for the event\nHelp maintain and update server images such as avatars, stickers, emojis, etc.\n(graymachine)\nProvide moderation support (live when possible) for meetings and community\nevents\nDrive users to the proper channels\nContinually monitoring channels, and other server banlists for potential\nspam/scammers and adding them into our banlist\nTaking part in Support/Ops triage process by shuttling members requesting support\nto the proper channels, connecting with self help resources, #support, Zendesk, etc\nas appropriate\nAppropriate use of Admin Switch by Community Moderation Workstream Leader\n\nWhat are the goals of this workstream? What metrics can this workstream’s\nsuccess be measured against?\nProvide 12 hour moderation coverage to ShapeShift DAO’s community channels,\nwith the eventual goal to provide 24 hour coverage\n\n—I like to Under Promise, and Over Deliver. I think i can stand by my actions so far to date.\n\nProactively ban 90% of scammers/bots that try to sneak into ShapeShift discord\n2022 July-Dec Moderation Workstream Renewal 3\nEnsure that all community meetings are scheduled on the calendar\nThe Moderation Workstream is successful when you don’t notice that it’s there.\nDuring the Jan - June 2022 term, the Moderation Workstream has accomplished the\nfollowing:\nStopped 21 raids (at the time of this posting)\nBanned 922+ bots (at the time of this posting)\nAssisted with Education with a new user flow\nSustainability updates to server roles and channels\nUpdates to Role Selector\nCreated embeds to improve readability\n\nBudget Plan $11,000 / month.\n$5k GK, $3.5k Pzy, $1.5k Shadow. $100 Bot (50/50 current/future) , $500 locked for Pzy. $400 locked for Shadow.

      "title": "[SCP-86] Create & Maintain Yieldy Tokens",
      "content": "SUMMARY:\n\nOne of the keys to ShapeShift DAO’s long-term success lies in its ability to create unique products that empower users to do more with their crypto. The DeFi world offers myriad ways to do just that, via novel lending and borrowing protocols that leverage their permissionless nature to plug directly into other DeFi protocols–the classic Money Lego paradigm.\n\nFOXy has been our first foray into the world of ShapeShift DeFi creations–and it’s been a solid success thus far. 50M FOX have been locked in the contract, which represents a substantial liquidity sink of roughly 13% of the token’s circulating supply.\n\nFOXy also produces regular revenue and buybacks of FOX for the DAO, simplifying FOX staking for users (and the DAO treasury), saving on gas costs of harvesting yield, all while the users still have their FOXy available to them to do whatever they wish across DeFi. Some early examples of this are using FOXy as collateral on Rari (while still earning yield and the weekly rebases) or LPing the FOXy onto elastic swap to earn further yield on one’s yield bearing asset without giving up the underlying yield that FOXy is entitled to.\n\nSPECIFICATIONS:\n\nThis proposal entails the creation and maintenance of the Yieldy infrastructure, including its smart contracts, tokens, and technical logistics. Specifically, this outlines a Yieldy Phase 1, with key parameters and operational details defined here:\n\nQ: What percentage of revenue earned from Yieldy strategies will be directed back to the DAO?\n\nA: 10%.\n\nQ: Which assets will be created initially?\n\nA: This proposal entails the creation of Yieldies for the following tokens: ETH, USDC, FEI, LUSD, and ALCX? Why those five? ETH and USDC are the most liquid assets in the space; FEI is a reliable stablecoin (plus, the DAO has built a meaningful relationship with the TRIBE community); LUSD is a compelling stablecoin alternative with solid liquidity; and ALCX represents a token of another vibrant and popular DAO.\n\nIn order to manage risk and implement a gradual rollout, only ETHy and USDCy will be deployed upon the approval of this proposal. The other three assets will be deployed after ETHy and USDCy have had a chance to be de-risked. The TMDC will determine when to launch FEIy, LUSDy, and ALCXy.\n\nQ: Who is responsible for the maintenance of Yieldy strategies?\n\nA: Similar to the responsibilities outlined in the FOXy proposal, the TMDC will determine how to manage the strategies that generate revenue for Yieldy assets. However, the strategies themselves will be a matter of community governance. The TMDC will also determine if, and when, to deploy FEIy, LUSDy, and ALCXy.\n\nQ: What revenue-generation strategy will Phase 1 of Yieldies employ?\n\nA: Again, borrowing a page from the FOXy playbook, Yieldies will rely on Tokemak reactors to generate revenue.\n\nQ: How will the DAO pay for the cost of building the Yieldy contracts?\n\nA: These contracts are already built, and are currently undergoing multiple audits.\n\nPOTENTIAL BENEFITS:\n\nYieldies offer a new way for the DAO to generate revenue, while also potentially benefiting FOXy holders (in the event revenue is used for FOX buybacks). These tokens would also strengthen ShapeShift’s position and name recognition in the DeFi world, thanks to their unique ability to generate yield in a simple, user-friendly fashion.\n\nAs alluded to above, the frictionless nature of Yieldies could allow the DAO to connect with a wider variety of users–both sophisticated DeFi degens, as well as those who are newer to crypto or less informed. Building these relationships with newer users could put more eyeballs on our platform and engender positive world-of-mouth.\n\nThere are also myriad benefits stemming from “money lego” applications of Yieldies. Building blocks like the combination of Yiieldies and Elasticswap create new possibilities for rebasing tokens across DeFi. Various vaults and tools could be created that leverage Yieldies (similar to what’s currently possible by LPing and staking FOX and FOXy onto ElasticSwap) that still captures the underlying yield of the yield bearing and rebasing token. This offers the tantalizing possibility of being able to earn yield on top of yield.\n\nPOTENTIAL DOWNSIDES:\n\nUnless an extremely deliberate and cautious approach is utilized, there is a high degree of risk involved with smart contracts that could someday hold hundreds of millions of dollars worth of crypto assets. The DAO is managing this risk in multiple ways:\n\n1.) Putting the smart contract code through multiple audits.\n\n2.) Releasing a limited number of Yieldy assets initially (ETHy and USDCy).\n\n3.) Placing TVL caps on these assets in order to limit the total amount of USD value that these contracts can hold.\n\nThis gradual, limited rollout mirrors best practices regularly employed across the DeFi and (more recently) the Rollup ecosystem. Once the ETHy and USDCy contracts have developed a track record of successful operation, the TMDC will have the option of raising the TVL limits and/or deploying the three additional Yieldy assets outlined in this proposal.\n\nEven with these steps in place, it’s impossible to provide guarantees against exploits or bugs. To that end, the DAO may want to consider having the contracts listed on risk harbor, which in turn could allow the DAO to insure itself against Yieldy smart contract failures.\n\nTo be clear: an exploit of a DAO-maintained smart contract could be disastrous both financially, and from a reputational perspective. Thus it’s crucial to release Yieldies in a methodical and careful fashion. For instance, the initial TVL limits placed on Yieldies should take into account the DAO’s ability to make users whole–something that’s readily doable with FOXy (since the DAO owns ample FOX), but not as possible with Yieldy assets.\n\nWHAT THIS VOTE DOES:\n\n1.) Create a regime for the deployment and maintenance of Yieldy assets as described above.",

      "title": "[SCP-87] Fund the product & creative services workstream July-Dec 2022",
      "content": "Abstract\n\nAs a product-centric DAO, the Product & Creative Services Workstream is vital to our success. The Workstream is accountable for a number of activities which are critical to the DAO’s ability to acquire and retain users, grow the FOX ecosystem, and achieve its mission. This is a proposal to continue funding the Product & Creative Services Workstream’s anticipated budget from July- Dec 15 2022.\n\nMotivation\n\nContinuing to fund this workstream will ensure that the ShapeShift DAO can retain the talent that the Workstream has, as we move into the next phase to design and build out our products for market fit, since we just entered the last large step needed for migrating users from Beta.shapeshift.com to the new web app.\n\nSpecification\n\nIn our last proposal, we outlined a lot of specific goals, and we’ve included a breakdown of those goals and how we did here: https://www.notion.so/shapeshift/Goals-Results-from-Jan-June-2022-af0987c327804e8b89eeafde8c6c01e4\n\nYou can view the top-level roadmap here: https://www.notion.so/shapeshift/68196f67e07943ed8bb1e10ac7d1430d?v=024c941b800e48d580630470d282e3dd (items completed are moved to the bottom of the list, everything in flight has a % representing how far along it is.\n\nWe hit the majority of our goals in the last budget round and are within arms reach of being able to sunset Beta. We are excited to move into this next phase of focusing on getting to Product market fit and having the data and analytics we need to be able to set KPIs, track, iterate and report back to the community on how we’re doing.\n\nThat said here are the next set of goals we’ve outlined for the next proposal round:\n\nHigh Level Goals\n\nContinue to curate and propose a product roadmap based on research, user behavior, user and community feedback, and data that aligns with the mission and goals of the ShapeShift DAO.\n\nContinue to provide feature specifications (including goals and success metrics), UI/UX designs, product management, and applicable front-end development for features prioritized by the ShapeShift DAO.\n\nContinue to represent the ShapeShift DAO’s product suite, roadmap, and workstream and act as a repository of knowledge.\n\nContinue to help ensure the delivery of prioritized features on time (being built by the core workstream and those being built by bounty hunters), on or under budget, and according to the acceptance criteria defined in each feature spec written by the Product Managers.\n\nContinue to assist with one-off community projects as needed, and make sure all projects executed by the workstream and outside the workstream are on brand and pass usability.\n\nContinue to help all ShapeShift DAO Workstreams communicate effectively, by creating engaging content that is aligned with the brand of ShapeShift DAO.\n\nContinue to communicate ideas, create materials to educate FOX holders, assist in the creative needs to help launch marketing campaigns and expand the effectiveness of the brand.\n\nSpecific Goals\n\nAs a reminder, we will remain agile—understanding that new partnerships or new revenue generating Defi projects that align with our vision, could be brought forward by the community, and some of those could shift our roadmap, especially if we believe that they could bring in new users or help with stickiness and user retention. We will relay progress of the roadmap (as always) back to the community in our Product Office hours, and highlight any changes to priorities and the reasoning behind those changes.\n\n•Identify features that bring in new users, assist user retention, bring in revenue streams for the DAO and help us get to Product Market fit.\n•Get the specs, UX/UI usability and KPIs set, tracked and reported on for each feature\n•Create a plan and get community and workstreams alignment on the strategy for the future of the mobile application\n•Monitor data and analytics in app.shapeshift.com once Pendo goes live and report back to the community\n•Get a dashboard created for staking Cosmos/Osmos and other upcoming Taxistake validators to track, monitor and report on back to the community\n•Sunset Beta, start migrating users into the new web app, set specific KPIs around this and report on those back to the community\n•Add at least 2 new EVM chains\n•Identify projects on those EVM chains that align with our vision, and help us achieve our goals of product market fit and additional revenue streams. Blow out specs, UX/UI and KPis on those projects we identify\n•Continue to evolve the UI for the web app, to be scalabile, systematic and easy for other protocols to eventually come integrate themselves\n•Identify at least 10 projects and features that can be bountied, and get them through the bounty process and shipped to production.\n•Continue with user interviews, collecting user feedback and create new personas to help our goals of getting to product market fit\n•Yieldys! (if this proposal passes). Get the spec, UX, KPIs set and the feature shipped to production\n•Metamask snaps - spec, UX and ship an MLP low-lift experiment. Set KPIs and track the results\n•Continue to support other departments as needed from a design/UI perspective — everything from Illustrations to blogs, events needs, etc\n•Continue to own, update and iterate on the shapeshift.com website\n•Continue to collaborate and evolve processes with engineering\n•Collaborate with marketing on product launches, and help track goals for user acquisition\n•Continue to collaborate with Operations and engineering on 4x/week feature releases - Testing and ensuring consistent UX across app.shapeshift.com website in production\n\nSuccess Metrics\n\nDefine and propose an evolving roadmap that aligns with the vision of the DAO and is discussed with and accepted by the community\n\nFeatures on the roadmap and goals outlined are delivered in milestones, on or under budget, and according to the acceptance criteria defined in each feature spec.\n\nExecute projects that lead to growth in DAO revenues and a 15% MOM growth in users (baseline to be established one month after migration from Beta has started.)\n\nThe KPIs specified in each feature spec are tracked and reported to the community (Hooray for analytics!)\n\nOwn and evolve the brand and ensure a polished, professional image in all that we DAO.\n\nBudget\n\nThere are a few changes to this proposal round in regards to head count. We’ve decided not to hire another UX developer at this point. We just don’t feel that the urgency or need is there at this time. If we can ramp up the development pace with this new plug in modal and more bounty-based engineering projects, and Beard gets stretched too thin, we will consider a proposal to fund that role. Again, only if it’s really needed. We have tried to determine where we can cut all expenses that aren’t absolutely necessary.\n\nDiggy is proposing to continue as Workstream leader, Beard is moving into a UX lead role, as he’s really started taking the reins with his front end knowledge and collaboration with Major Hayes and engineering on the new plug-in model. Diggy is still also doing UX, but it’s come naturally to this point, that Beard moves more into a lead UX position.\n\nFoxMcCloud has decided to step down from his role in the DAO to take a break. With that said, and trying not to increase budget, GrayMachine has agreed to step into a PM role and split his time with creative services. GrayMachine has plenty of experience as a PM after many years at a large software company. We are excited for his transition and hope that we’ll be able to succeed, without adding any new roles at this point. Hoff is also going to cut back to part-time and the entire workstream is taking a size-able portion of their salaries in FOX. I’ve also looked at where I can shift any other budget (like bounties) from USDC to FOX. Overall, we’ve been able to significantly cut our budget.\n\nSo where does that leave us? The new Product & Creative Services workstream will consist of just 5 members:\n\n![Screen Shot 2022-06-27 at 9.04.53 AM.png](ipfs://QmXKkghW8AZG1ydgtFkeDVgv8g9MGLQc5nHG29mysSRLC2)\n\nOur approved budget for the last round of 6 months was: $686,049*. Our actual budget ended up being: $545,279 (Mostly USDC and a small portion in FOX). I miscalculated previously, as the last proposal went until June 30, but since payroll is on the 15th, I had to update the numbers to consider the end of June.\n\nOur new proposed budget starting from July 1, is now just $364,636. However, a large portion of that is in FOX, so we’re only requesting $294,053 in USDC for this proposal round. We also have USDC leftover, and we can return that to the DAO treasury or apply to this next round of funding. Furthermore, we already received 20K to the DAO treasury for Axelar UX and another 50K will be paid back to the treasury from the YAT bounty.\n\nHere is the breakdown of actual stables and FOX allocation for this round:\n \n![Screen Shot 2022-06-27 at 9.05.02 AM.png](ipfs://QmcjEtUdUAdNQekYATMmtUgYLpfnLLxcurRc5k2JVdzLUL)\n    \n\n*This covers salaries, software, bounties, test funds, etc.\n\nView the detailed budget here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10NM9yP8U_014UaPTMj9xQygjjhmfSav6cd5jdzmPRHU/edit#gid=356763085\n\nIf this proposal passes, most of this budget will be distributed in stable coin and FOX as outlined above. The equivalent amount of USDC & a portion in FOX will be transferred from the DAO’s treasury to the Product Workstream on Colony on a monthly basis. All unused funds will be returned to the DAO or rolled-over to the next budget cycle.\n\nBenefits\n\nIf this proposal passes, the DAO will continue to receive the following services which are integral to its success:\n\n• Proposed feature roadmap encompassing the following products the DAO: ShapeShift Mobile app, web app, shapeshift.com, and any other products the ShapeShift DAO launches\n\n• Feature specs for prioritized features including goals, success metrics, and acceptance criteria\n\n• UI/UX for each prioritized feature\n\n• Front-end development\n\n• Reporting on product KPIs and feature success metrics (Analytics!)\n\n• Design-oriented and brand-focused creative support, guidelines, and guardrails to the myriad of projects the DAO will take on\n\nDrawbacks\n\nThe main potential risk is whether the cost/benefit of a product workstream will be worth it to the DAO’s bottom-line in the long term. To mitigate this risk, funding is only being requested from July-Dec 2022. The funds will be managed on Colony and can be revoked by the DAO in a worst-case-scenario.\n\nVote\n\nFOR: You support funding the workstream and the anticipated budget for July - Dec\n\nAGAINST: You do not support continuing to fund this workstream",

      "content": "#### Summary\n\nOn 6/2/22, DAO and Fox Foundation engineers migrated the [app.shapeshift.com ](http://app.shapeshift.com/) site to be hosted by Fleek, backed by IPFS. In addition to the many benefits of having the site deployed to IPFS, Fleek is a very web3 friendly company that has prioritized features that will allow the DAO to become the direct owner of the account. Currently, the fleek account is owner by the Fox Foundation. This proposal seeks approval to transfer account to the Shapeshift DAO for the DAO to have direct control over its administration.\n\n#### Abstract\n\nIf this proposal passes, the DAO would become the owner of the fleek account currently associated with [app.shapeshift.com ](http://app.shapeshift.com/). This removes the foundation from owning infrastructure that is currently able to owned and managed directly by the DAO and sets a precedent for the Foundation to divest itself of these assets and associated controls as soon as it becomes possible.\n\nFleek currently provides login using ethereum wallets and are currently working on an integration for gnosis safe. Their permissions model allows for an “owner” account to grant access to account admins. Finally, Fleek also accepts crypto as payment for their services and is willing to transfer the ownership into the hands of the Shapeshift DAO multi-sig.\n\n#### Motivation\n\nSimply put, the DAO should be the direct owner of any asset that it is practically able. Fleek has done a wonderful job at making this possible and we should move quickly to utilize these features and encourage other companies to follow suite.\n\n#### Specification\n\nAs soon as the gnosis integration is complete, the Fox Foundation will transfer ownership and the administration responsibilities of Fleek to the Shapeshift DAO. The Shapeshift DAO will be responsible for delegating access to the Engineering work-stream leader.\n\nThe current cost of Fleek’s services is $40/mo\n\n### [Plans and Pricing - Fleek | Build on the New Internet](https://fleek.co/pricing/)\n\nWhether you are working solo, or deploying an IPFS site/application with an Enterprise team, you'll find the right fit for your needs in our plans.\n\nThe DAO would also need to come up with a mechanism to pay the monthly bill in USDC, DAI or ETH to fleekhq.eth\n\n#### Benefits\n\n* Removes the Foundation from owning assets that the DAO should own and administer directly\n* Shows Fleek that the features they are prioritizing are important and that there is a real use case for DAO owned accounts\n* Creates precedent for the Foundation to transfer assets to the DAO as soon as it it feasible for the DAO to own these assets directly, an important step in the gradual scaling down of the Foundation.\n\n#### Drawbacks\n\n* $40/Mo in expenses and the need to facilitate these payments\n\n#### Further reading\nhttps://blog.fleek.co/posts/crypto-wallet-logins-drip",

      "title": "[SCP 82] Proposal to Request Funding for Video Post Production with Amadeus Style",
      "content": "**Summary:**\n\nAmadeus Style, a Blockchain Media House, is requesting 6,500 USDC funding to complete a series of videos from at ETHDenver 2022.\n\nTimeline of delivery: some videos will be delivered immediately, with the remaining videos delivered within about 4 weeks.\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nDuring ETHDenver 2022, there were a considerable amount of videos contracted by ShapeShift for Amadeus Style to complete. These were delivered, paid for and were very well received by the community.\n\nView the ETHDenver 2022 ShapeShift videos here:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLljNYhEYU6tRpmXl3atM7hcYZghtCkcqS\n\nHowever, there is a considerable amount of footage gathered at ETHDenver that was outside of the scope of the original contract paid for by Marketing and Growth. This proposal is simply to finish editing this footage into usable stories, and to deliver these assets to ShapeShift. Note that although these are from ETHDenver, the content and stories resonate well outside of the event itself. These are all very usable through the next 3-6 months.\n\n**Motivation:**\n\nDynamic and engaging video content can be very expensive to produce. Cameras, lighting, audio, logging footage, editing, graphics, etc., are all very costly services to hire out. We are in a unique situation where Amadeus Style voluntarily recorded interviews and events at one of the largest crypto events in the world. They have pushed forward logging the footage, and piecing together usable stories without any compensation so far. It’s in ShapeShift’s best interest to put all of these great interviews and talks to use. Hiring out a crew to do this from scratch would easily cost 10 times the proposed amount.\n\nCompleting these videos will provide ShapeShift with a myriad of incredible content to help build the growing YouTube channel and provide quality content for social media. These videos were selected based on ShapeShift’s current marketing and communication goals.\n\n**Specification:**\n\nAmadeus Style will edit and deliver 15 YouTube videos and 20 social media videos to the Creative Services squad, to be used in conjunction with Marketing and Growth to promote the DAO with video content. Files will be organized into Google Drive folders for delivery. A master doc with notes will be provided for getting the content published.\n\n*YouTube Videos - Storied*\n\nThese videos will include short snippets that communicate ShapeShift’s mission and vision.\n\n* Becoming a DAO - 2-3 mins\n* What’s Next For Shapeshift - 2-3 min\n* Working at a DAO - 2-3 mins\n* The ShapeShift Community - 2-3 mins\n* Get involved with a DAO - 2-3 mins\n* ShapeShift’s Engineering Road Map - 2 min\n\n*YouTube Videos - Single Interviews*\n\nThese are shorter videos for YouTube from individual interviews that form a quick and relevant point, great for sharing more about ShapeShift in a shorter form from a single interviewee.\n\n* What is Tokenomics - 2 mins\n* CoinCenter Fundraiser - 1 min\n* What is ShapeShift + transitioning into a DAO - 2 mins\n* Advice for DAOs wanting to foster collaboration - 1:15 min\n* How Josh got involved with ShapeShift - 1:15\n* Advice if you’re thinking about starting a DAO - 1:15 mins\n* Goals of Treasury Management - 1 min\n* Navigating a Crypto Winter Safely - 1 min\n* Engineering direction for Shapeshift DAO - 1min\n\n*Social Media Videos (20)*\n\nThese are intended to be highly shareable and even shorter than the YouTube videos listed above. Generally 20-40 second highlight clips from the talks and interviews, often formatted specifically for a platform (e.g. 9:16 for YouTube, 1:1 for Instagram)\n\n* ETH Denver summaries - 6 shorts\n* Josh Interview summaries - 4 shorts\n* Willy Interview summaries - 3 shorts\n* Rotorless Interview\n   * How I got involved with SS DAO - 30 seconds\n   * [Meet the Community - Rotorless](https://vimeo.com/manage/videos/696277348) (links to video example)\n   * The Best Part About Working for a DAO - 1 min\n* Kent Interview\n  * What’s next for ShapeShift - 1 min\n  * ETH Denver Highlights - 1 min (could be nice to tag @ETHDenver)\n* 0xDeF1Cafe Interview\n  * Favorite thing working at the DAO - 23 seconds\n  * What’s next for ShapeShift - 54 seconds\n\nDrawbacks:\n\nThe drawback of passing this proposal is cost. I realize we are trying to keep budgets lean. However, letting the footage go unused would be wasteful.\n\n\n\n\n",

      "title": "[SCP-83] Extending Protocol Owned Liquidity on Uniswap and Starting POL on Bancor v3",
      "content": "SUMMARY:\n\nThis proposal extends and modifies the current phase of liquidity mining incentives, which end mid-July.\n\nABSTRACT:\n\nThis proposal outlines the latest revision to our liquidity mining efforts (an update to [SCP-55]). This proposal continues the LM program on Uniswap v2 for another 4.5 months past the current early July end date, alongside the creation and funding of liquidity mining incentives on Bancor v3.\n\nMOTIVATION:\n\nOwning liquidity is important. Insufficient liquidity can exacerbate price slippage. FOX needs to be present and available throughout the Defi ecosystem for the stability and long-term success of FOX and Shapeshift DAO.\n\nIn light of fewer liquidity provisioning options, this proposal seeks to ensure sufficient liquidity for FOX, and for that liquidity to be owned by Shapeshift DAO.\n\nSPECIFICATION:\n\nThis proposal would extend the Uniswap FOX/ETH v2 LP reward program for this next 4.5 month LM cycle. This reward program would be for 6.75M FOX.\n\nSCP-55 extended and modified the current phase of LP rewards for an additional 4.5 months and was approved in January. This proposal would extend LM rewards 4.5 months past the current early July end date (with a new LM program). This proposal will allocate 6.75M FOX for this next program.\n\nThe Bancor v3 LP reward program will last 4.5 months and start from the time of FOX being listed on Bancor v3. Up to 6.75M FOX will be deposited to Bancor v3, which Bancor will match up to 50k BNT, emitted over a 24-month schedule. All previously whitelisted tokens will be introduced to Bancor v3. As FOX is whitelisted with Bancor, this means that FOX should be listed on Bancor v3 sometime between May 29th and June 5th.\n\nBancor v3 is different than Bancor v2 in that impermanent loss protection is now instant (was 100-day wait before), with the drawback that there is a 0.25% withdrawal fee imposed. In addition, Bancor v3 imposes a 7 day redeem cooldown window. To ensure impermanent loss protection, Bancor v3 allows for DAOs to escrow a certain amount of their token to “bail out” individuals who would otherwise suffer from an impermanent loss.\n\nBancor v2 rewards were denominated in BNT only. Bancor v3 rewards can be BNT and the native token, or FOX in our case. In Bancor v3, these FOX reward tokens (FOX LP tokens) are, initially, part of the liquidity provided (unlike in v2). These FOX LP tokens (living in bancor-land) autocompound and are staked in a burner, ensuring that the ultimate redemption of the FOX LP tokens results in more FOX tokens than FOX LP tokens staked/burned.\n\nThrough v3, user experience is simplified to one swap (from the 2 necessary in Bancor v2). This will better develop the liquidity necessary for FOX to function well.\n\nWhat This Proposal Would Do:\n\nUp to 6.75M FOX will be allocated as liquidity mining rewards for the Uniswap v2 LM program 2 days before the current one ends (mid-July). This program will last for 4.5 months.\nStart LP reward program on Bancor v3 (when available) up to the amount of 6.75M (4.5 month period, starting when FOX is available on Bancor v3).\nDeposit 10M FOX into Bancor v3 from the Shapeshift DAO Treasury.\nAuthorize the creation and funding of an IL-protection escrow pool, up to the amount of 1M FOX, the existence and funding amount to be ultimately to be decided by the TMDC.\nBENEFITS\n\nBancor will match up to 50k BNT to any whitelisted v2 token (this includes FOX).\n\nShapeshift will provide liquidity in the form of the 10M FOX deposit.\n\nIncentivized liquidity provision by FOX holders.\n\nShapeshift will augment the Bancor IL protection with an escrow account holding $1M FOX, to be paid out to FOX holders in cases of IL.\n\nDRAWBACKS\n\nSmart contract risk\nThe decrease in rewards to Uniswap FOX/ETH pool may result in a temporary shock to liquidity if LP holders react quickly and significantly.\nWHAT EXACTLY DOES THIS PROPOSAL DO?\n\nYES:\n\nExtend the Uniswap v2 FOX/ETH LM rewards program for an additional 4.5 months with 6.75M FOX from the Shapeshift DAO Treasury as allocated rewards.\n\nOn or after the date that FOX becomes available on Bancor v3, authorize the TMDC to allocate up to 6.75M FOX from the Shapeshift DAO Treasury in liquidity mining rewards.\nOn our after the date that FOX becomes available on Bancor v3, authorize the TMDC to allocate up to 10M FOX into Bancor v3 from the Shapeshift DAO Treasury.\n\nAuthorize the creation and funding of an IL-protection escrow pool, up to the amount of 1M FOX, the existence and funding amount to be ultimately decided by the TMDC.\n\nNO: \n\nNo changes are made. (In this case, the DAO will need to pass another proposal if it wants to extend its liquidity mining program past mid-July).",

      "title": "[SCP-81] Enable Partial Salaries in FOX",
      "content": "Summary:\n\nAllow workstream contributors to elect to receive part of their salaries in FOX through Hedgey time-lock bonds.\n\nAbstract:\n\nIf passed, this proposal would allow each workstream contributor to choose from the options listed in the Specification section for a portion of their monthly contribution compensation to be paid in FOX tokens. Contributors would select a percentage of pay in FOX, along with a time-lock period. This would result in extra FOX being paid to contributors, relative to what they’d receive if they did not choose one of these options. (Alternatively, contributors could choose to receive their pay as usual.)\n\nMotivation:\n\nIn order to conserve the DAO’s stablecoin treasury, and to align contributors to the long-term success of FOX, it would benefit all parties for contributors to have the option to opt-in to receive part of their monthly salary in FOX. To incentivize this behavior, the DAO would offer a “bonus” in the form of additional FOX. The longer the time-lock selected, the larger the bonus.\n\nSpecification:\nContributors will be able to choose any percentage of their salary to be paid in FOX. Contributors can modify the percentage to be paid in FOX each pay period. Any changes must be communicated to their workstream leader.\n\nIf choosing any amount of salary in FOX, a time-lock period must also be selected. The longer the time-lock, the bigger the bonus:\n\n3-month lock, 5% extra FOX\n6-month lock, 10% extra FOX\n12-month lock, 20% extra FOX\n18-month lock, 30% extra FOX\n\nThe USDC portion of pay will be available immediately, but the amount of FOX–both the base amount and the extra from the time-lock selection–will be locked and unavailable until the time-lock expires.\n\nAt this time, it looks like the best option to offer this incentive is through Hedgey bonds. With Hedgey bonds, every month employees will receive an NFT that can be traded for the corresponding amount of FOX upon time-lock expiry. It would also be possible to sell the NFTs before the time-lock period is over to interested parties for USDC or any other crypto.\n\nThe Tokenomics committee may change these specifications at any time, except for the fact that this program is voluntary. That aspect can only be changed by a community vote. Any other specification listed here is subject to change. Any changes will be communicated.\n\nBenefits:\n\nThe DAO benefits by spending its stablecoins more slowly, allowing for a longer period to sustain a bear market and/or recession.\n\nContributors benefit by having the option to increase their salaries by agreeing to lock-up the FOX portion of their pay (plus a bonus) for a specified time period.\n\nDrawbacks:\n\nIt would be inappropriate if any contributor felt undue pressure to participate in this program. With that in mind, it’s important to note that this program would be completely voluntary. All contributors have the right to choose to receive their pay in 100% stablecoins–or, if they currently receive FOX instead of USDC, to maintain the status quo of receiving all their FOX immediately.\n\nVote:\n\nA “yes” vote would enable contributors to select a percentage of pay in FOX, and a time-lock period with a corresponding FOX bonus as specified above. It would also trigger the ability for workstream leaders and multi-sig signers to create new Hedgey bonds for each pay period to meet this need.\n\nA “no” vote means nothing changes.",

      "content": "This proposal, is actually an Addendum to the passed analytics proposal https://boardroom.io/shapeshift/proposal/cHJvcG9zYWw6c2hhcGVzaGlmdDpkZWZhdWx0OjB4MDA5M2E4YTczYWY4MjcyYWQ0ZTEwNzU4YzcxZTExOGY3YTQxMTgxOTNhYTdmZTUwNTMzOTQ1MjFkZWQ0YmEzOA==. The goal is to make app.shapeshift.com contain analytics.\n\nPROPOSAL DESCRIPTION\nSummary:\n\nThere is an extreme need for analytics in the product that we’re building, and the ability to understand how we’re doing in our goals as a DAO, if we are building the right features, and reaching product market fit. After discussion on product and engineering and with the community and other members in the DAO, this proposal was created as an addendum to the original proposal. \n\nThis addendum is to have the ShapeShift web app (app.shapeshift.com) include analytics.\n\nIt will still be an opt-in that users will agree to participate in upon entering (as voted on and approved by the community and token holders in the original proposal). If the user does not wish to use the version with analytics, they can choose to go to the private version that will have no analytics. See mock up for the idea—please note that the copy is not final:\n\n![exampleforopt-in.jpeg](ipfs://Qmbp4jKsxLAXqzgUw6AeeWcrfFkWroNiZoPCrQEac88qY1)\n\n\nThis proposal is simply to clarify that app.shapeshift.com would be the default application with analytics, and private.shapeshift.com will be the optional application with no analytics.\n\nMotivation:\n\nWe have a responsibility to the DAO and the FOX Token holders. How do we prove and measure the effectiveness of what we’re doing? Are we successful? Are we reaching product market fit? Which marketing messages and programs lead to spikes in user acquisition? Are we retaining users? We require a large portion of our user base to use the version with analytics to get the data we need to be able to answer these questions, and to draw insights on where we’re succeeding and where we need to improve. Therefore, the Product & Creative Services Workstream is proposing to have analytics as part of the default web experience.\n\nSpecification\nAnalytics & Private Versions\n\napp.shapeshift.com with analytics, and a private version without analytics.\n\nMaintenance\n\nNothing changes from the original proposal.\n\nReviewing Data\n\nNothing changes from the original proposal.\n\nBudget\n\nNo budget is required for this addendum.\n\nBenefits\n\nReiterated from the original proposal:\n\nBy using Pendo, we’ll have an all-in-one platform for tracking, analyzing, and creating guided user journeys (instead of paying for multiple platforms). We expect the initial setup to take several weeks to get all the guides and the resource center up and running. As mentioned above, all of that will be handled as part of the Product Workstream responsibilities. It will not require engineering efforts.\n\nRetention is an important metric, and one that can be improved by utilizing this approach. We’ll be able to take our user experience to the next level, guiding and engaging our users at the right moments, leading to better feature engagement and higher user retention. Without the metrics we would have an extremely difficult time determining where to improve the UX and measuring the success of our product.\n\nNew feature adoption rates will also be evaluated as a metric to measure success. We will be able to see which marketing messages, promotions, and tactics are the most effective in driving users to the app.\n\nDrawbacks\n\nWe will still have both versions, as outlined in the original proposal. One drawback could be that if we don’t get enough users opting into the analytics version, we would still be struggling to get the valuable data that we need.\n\nVote\n\nIf you vote “for” this proposal you agree to have app.shapeshift.com 1 the default version with analytics.\n\nIf you vote “against” this proposal, you do not think this is the correct approach",

      "title": "[SCP-71] Proposal to Create the KeepKey Workstream",
      "content": "## Summary\n\nThis proposal establishes and funds a new KeepKey workstream, and elects @pastaghost and @highlander as workstream leaders. The workstream will utilize a hybrid funding strategy, with 50% of the funding being contributed by KeepKey, and 50% of the funding being contributed by the ShapeShift DAO. The primary efforts of the workstream will be directed toward building applications to support KeepKey users as well as the ongoing maintenance of the  KeepKey integrations in existing ShapeShift products. Revenues from KeepKey device sales will be shared equally with the ShapeShift DAO for the period of this workstream.\n\n\nLinks to the original and incubation and ideation posts can be found here:\n\n[incubation](https://forum.shapeshift.com/t/proposal-to-create-the-keepkey-workstream/1269) | [ideation](https://forum.shapeshift.com/t/scp-71-proposal-to-create-the-keepkey-workstream/1308)\n\n## Abstract\n\nAs of Jan 1, 2022, KeepKey is now owned by @pastaghost and @highlander. Despite KeepKey now being independently owned and operated, the overwhelming number of KeepKey users are also ShapeShift users, as ShapeShift is currently the only deFi platform providing first-class KeepKey support. The total amount of assets in orbit currently held on KeepKey devices is quite large (~$2.3B as of March 2021), and so it is in the mutual interest of both KeepKey and ShapeShift to work to migrate those users to the v2 web application and provide a high-quality UX that promotes customer retention and trading activity across the platform. This document proposes a workstream, led by @pastaghost and @highlander, that will assemble and manage a joint engineering effort to build and maintain the KeepKey integration in the ShapeShift v2 platform and expand the product offerings in the KeepKey ecosystem. The ultimate goal of the workstream is to ensure that the ShapeShift platform is the number one place to use KeepKey devices and that KeepKey is the number one wallet to use on the ShapeShift platform. \n\nThis proposal seeks to fund the proposed KeepKey workstream for a six-month term, after which the viability of the workstream will be reassessed and its funding recalculated based on feedback from the ShapeShift DAO. The workstream will utilize a hybrid funding strategy, with 50% of the funding being contributed by KeepKey, and 50% of the funding being contributed by the ShapeShift DAO. The workstream will be operated as a profit-generating enterprise, and sales revenues will be shared equally between KeepKey and the ShapeShift DAO treasury for the duration of the workstream. The portion of generated revenues allocated to the ShapeShift DAO treasury is only of supplementary benefit to the ShapeShift DAO; the primary financial benefits of this workstream to the ShapeShift DAO are the potential earnings generated by increased user traffic and increased valuation of the FOX token as a result of the efforts of the workstream. With estimates of assets held on KeepKey devices exceeding 2.3 billion dollars, there is a large potential for KeepKey to be the ShapeShift DAO’s largest revenue generator if users successfully migrate to the new platform.\n\nThe KeepKey workstream shall be responsible for the following:\n\n- Maintenance of KeepKey integration on legacy and v2 platforms\n- Customer support for KeepKey issues raised through the ShapeShift support channels\n- Development of KeepKey related features requested by the engineering workstream in v2 web application\n- Technical support for the portions of future bounties accepted ShapeShift DAO involving KeepKey\n- Technical support for partners of the ShapeShift DAO building with KeepKey\n- Negotiate and organize opportunities with external partner organizations to the benefit of ShapeShift, KeepKey, or both. This includes, but is not limited to, adding native support for deFi platforms to KeepKey, adding support for new assets to KeepKey and its related products, or any other relevant bounties proposed by external partners.\n\n## Motivation\n\nIn order to maximize the success of the ShapeShift platform, users of the legacy ShapeShift web application need to be able to seamlessly migrate to the v2 application. Since the overwhelming majority of legacy ShapeShift’s assets in orbit were held on KeepKey devices, it follows that maximizing user migration to the v2 app requires that first-class support for KeepKey be provided by the new application. With KeepKey, we are able to tailor the hardware wallet UX to the needs of the ShapeShift user base in order to provide existing users of both ShapeShift and KeepKey with the best hardware wallet experience available online. Doing so is of mutual benefit to both KeepKey, by providing users with quality services that promote customer retention, and ShapeShift, by promoting KeepKey user activity on the platform and driving revenue to the ShapeShift DAO through the existing affiliate revenue programs.\n\n## Specification\n\n### Goals\n\n- Retain existing KeepKey users\n- Drive new and existing KeepKey users to the ShapeShift v2 platform\n- Drive KeepKey user activity on the ShapeShift v2 platform\n\n### Success Metrics\n\nMeasured KPIs:\n\n- Targeted 8% month-over-month increase in device sales\n- Targeted 8% month-over-month increase in new device setups\n- Targeted 8% month-over-month increase in average daily active users\n- New device setups and average daily active users to be measured using Pendo on Alpha platform\n\n### Funding\n\n150,000 USDC contributed by KeepKey\n150,000 USDC contributed by ShapeShift DAO\n\nFunds are to be transferred to a treasury service controlled by the workstream leaders.\n\n### Budget\n\n| **Position**                    \t| **Monthly Expense** \t| **6-Month Total Expense** \t|\n|---------------------------------\t|---------------------\t|---------------------------\t|\n| Leadership                      \t| $4,638.33           \t| $27,830.00                \t|\n|                                 \t| $4,638.33           \t| $27,830.00                \t|\n| Sr. Firmware Engineer           \t| $16,666.67          \t| $100,000.00               \t|\n| Engineering Bounty Allocation           \t| $15,000.00          \t| $90,000.00                \t|\n| Discretionary Engineering Funds \t| \t\t\t| $3,000.00                 \t|\n| Marketing Manager       \t| $2,500.00           \t| $15,000.00                \t|\n| Discretionary Marketing Funds   \t|                     \t| $24,340.00                \t|\n| Support Agent / Fulfillment\t\t| $2,000.00           \t| $12,000.00                \t|\n| **Total**                       \t| **$50,000.00**      \t| **$300,000.00**           \t|\n\n\n*Notes:\n\n- Any unused funds remaining at the end of the workstream period will be divided evenly and returned to the KeepKey/ShapeShift DAO treasuries.\n- Funds allocated for the above-listed engineering positions may be used to hire short-term contractors anytime during the duration of the workstream that those positions are vacant.\n\n### Leadership Compensation\n\nLeadership may not take any income directly from this workstream that exceeds minimum wage, with minimum wage being defined as $55,660 annually or $27,830 total over the duration of this proposal.\n\n### Benefits\n\n- 10% of KeepKey sales revenue will be used to purchase FOX, which will then be sent on a monthly basis to the FOXy contract to increase rebasing rewards for all FOXy holders. This will continue in perpetuity, so long as KeepKey and the ShapeShiftDAO maintain a productive working relationship.\n- For the period of this proposal, the ShapeShift DAO treasury will receive direct monthly payments from KeepKey in the amount of 50% of the remaining KeepKey sales revenue. An itemized sales report will be made publicly available to all members of the ShapeShift DAO.\n\n### Drawbacks\n\nIt cannot be guaranteed that this Workstream proposal will be profitable for either KeepKey or the ShapeShift DAO. The profitability of the workstream depends directly on KeepKey sales revenue.",

      "title": "SCP-73: FOX – GIV Treasury Swap and Liquidity Provision",
      "content": "Summary\n\nWe propose to create a $1,000,000 FOX / GIV liquidity pool by swapping FOX tokens from the ShapeShift DAO treasury for GIV tokens from the Giveth DAO treasury, then adding the tokens to a combined liquidity pool.\n\nYou can read the original proposal and discussion at the Shapeshift Forum: https://forum.shapeshift.com/t/scp-73-fox-giv-treasury-swap-and-liquidity-provision/1333\n\n\nAbstract\n\nWe propose taking a total allocation of $500,000 worth of FOX tokens from the treasury to create a FOX / GIV liquidity pool.\n\nWe initially swap $250,000 worth of the FOX tokens to the Giveth DAO for $250,000 worth of GIV tokens.\n\nWe will then take the GIV tokens we receive, pair them with the remaining $250,000 of FOX tokens from the initial allocation, and deposit them together into a new FOX / GIV liquidity pool.\n\nAt the same time, we ask that the Giveth DAO take the $250,000 in FOX tokens they receive, match them with a further $250,000 in GIV tokens, and deposit them into the same FOX / GIV liquidity pool.\n\nThe result will be a liquidity pool with $1,000,000 in liquidity.\n\nMotivation\n\nShapeshift and Giveth have complementary goals around decentralizing finance and creating new ways for individuals to access funding.\n\nTo illustrate the alignment, here are the Shapeshift vision and mission:\n\nVision:\n\nWe envision a borderless financial system built on open, decentralized protocols.\n\nMission:\n\nWe shall be the pathway into this borderless financial system; an open-source, multi-chain, self-custody crypto platform enabling billions to achieve financial sovereignty.\n\n\nCompare that to the goals of the Giveth team:\n\nGiveth is a community focused on **Building the Future of Giving** using blockchain technology. Our intention is to support and reward the funding of public goods by creating open, transparent and free access to the revolutionary funding opportunities available within the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nTo further those ends, it would be helpful to increase the amount of token liquidity available to both DAOs, increasing the overall utility of the tokens and reducing the friction of making transactions in both currencies.\n\nThe Giveth team has expressed an interest in exploring this partnership, and wants to gauge interest among members of the Shapeshift DAO.\n\n\n\nSpecification\n\nThe following steps will happen:\n\n 1.   The ShapeShift DAO and the Giveth DAO will both hold votes on whether to approve the trade.\n\nIf both votes are approved, the process will move forward.\n\n2.    Both DAOs will agree on a day and time when the token prices will be set, and an exchange or website that will act as the definitive token price setter.\n3.    Based on the price of FOX at the appointed day and time, the ShapeShift DAO will remove $250,000 worth of FOX tokens from the treasury, and send them to the Giveth DAO. In return, the Giveth DAO will send $250,000 worth of GIV tokens to the ShapeShift DAO.\n4.    After receiving the GIV tokens, ShapeShift DAO will take those tokens along with another $250,000 of FOX tokens from the ShapeShift treasury, and put them into a FOX / GIV liquidity pool.\n    a. We will host the pool on Honeyswap on the Gnosis chain\n    b. We will hold the LP tokens using the Shapeshift Gnosis safe.\n5.    We cannot explicitly control what the Giveth DAO does with their assets. But our expectation will be that they take the FOX tokens they receive, combine them with an additional $250,000 of GIV tokens, and put both tokens into a FOX / GIV liquidity pool.\n    a. To maximize the liquidity, we hope they will put them into the same Honeyswap pool on the Gnosis chain.\n\nBenefits\n\nThe primary benefit is increased liquidity for token swaps.\n\nThe Giveth team is currently establishing liquidity pools with several other partner DAOs that are related, complementary, or otherwise similar. By enhancing FOX/GIV liquidity, we make it easier for those other tokens to interact with the ShapeShift ecosystem.\n\nDrawbacks\n\nIt takes tokens from the treasury that could otherwise be used for other purposes.\n\nWhile we expect the Giveth DAO will use the swapped tokens to add to the liquidity pool, there is no effective way to guarantee they are put to that use. In effect, once we swap tokens, the Giveth DAO is free to use them as they wish. Nevertheless, we believe they will add them to the pool.\n\nVote\n\nYES : Swap $250,000 of FOX tokens to the Giveth DAO for $250,000 in GIV tokens, then add $250,000 of FOX tokens and the GIV tokens to a FOX / GIV liquidity pool\n\nNO: Do not swap tokens with the Giveth DAO, and do not add tokens to a GIV / FOX liquidity pool.",

      "content": "\nThis proposal is to authorize the Treasury Management and Diversification Committee (TMDC) to:\n\n1. advise on the allocation over certain limited assets located within the ShapeShift treasury, amounting to 60M FOX tokens;\n\n2. to advise on decisions for the treasury to meet meet payroll and operating expenses with stable coins each month; and\n\n3. to continue to advise on the pools the community owns, and to advise on the allocation of the current positions of the DAO’s DeFI earning FOX and other non-native assets (non-FOX) owned by the DAO.\n\nSummary\n\nThe TMDC was established for a trial period in SCP -36 in Nov 2021 and subsequently continued on an indefinite basis by SCP -62 in Feb 2022.\n\n[SCP-36](https://forum.shapeshift.com/t/scp-36-proposal-for-treasury-management-and-diversification-committee-official-ideation-thread/742/5) authorized the TMDC to advise over 60M FOX tokens to carry out its mandate. At the time the TMDC was continued at [SCP-62](https://forum.shapeshift.com/t/ideation-post-scp-62-proposal-to-continue-the-treasury-management-and-diversification-committee/1097/8), the TMDC had not exhausted the initial allotment of 60M FOX under its control from SCP-36.\n\nThe TMDC has now exhausted or will reach exhaustion of the allotment of FOX from SCP-36. Consequently, the TMDC is requesting a renewed, similar allotment of 60M FOX tokens to carry on its mandate.\n\nAlso, the TMDC is requesting an authorization from the DAO to make advisments that are limited in scope, to ensure that monthly payroll and operating expenses are met with stable coins each month.\n\nThis second request arises from the experience of the TMDC over the last five months where the pathway to meeting those obligations was not always clear.\n\nThird, the TMDC is requesting a specification to continue providing administration of the DAO-owned pools, as well as advisement of allocations of the DAO’s non-native assets in DeFi strategies (mostly staking those assets etc) as needed.\n\nAbstract\n\nIf this proposal is passed, the TMDC will be authorized to advise on the allocation of an additional 60M FOX tokens in the Shapeshift treasury. This would bring the total allocation under TMDC advice to 120M FOX. This proposal also authorizes the TMDC to exercise limited control over native and non-native assets in the Shapeshift DAO treasury for the express purpose of meeting DAO payment obligations.\n\nMotivation\n\nThis document summarizes the TMDC placements and outcomes since inception. https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1S6p9w08_CJe6vL99j34wyYwC1VJdlY9wj_rGV0i1arQ/edit#gid=1620962441\n\nAt the end of March 2022, TMDC made placements in the amount of 55,242,803 FOX and acquired assets valued at approximately $6,520,709 while at the same time taking actions to ensure payroll and operational expenses were met.\n\nWith the exhaustion of the allotment of the initial 60M FOX tokens from SCP-36, the TMDC does not have further assets to advise placement on , but still needs to fulfil its mandate, and also still needs to meet the DAO’s future stablecoin obligations.\n\nAuthorizing a new allotment of 60M FOX will enable the TMDC to advise on the deployment of the additional tokens to acquire stable coins to meet monthly payments and to build resilience in the DAO treasury.\n\nBenefits\n\nContinue to stack stable coins for treasury\n\nContinue to make stablecoin payments\n\nImprove TMDC’s ability to manage and create new balanced Defi positions\n\nDrawbacks\n\nOpportunity costs of asset placements.\n\n",

      "title": "[SCP-79] Deploy a ShapeShift EPNS Channel",
      "content": "    Summary\nThis proposal is to officially choose EPNS as our notification provider and create an account with them.\n\n    Abstract\nEPNS is the Ethereum Push Notification Service. They launched in January and allow DAOs to send push notifications related to governance proposals (new proposal on Snapshot, 24 hours remaining, results, etc.) on their mobile app, web app, and browser extension. Soon they will enable voting on proposals from the notifications.\n\nIf this proposal is implemented, EPNS will be used to send notifications about governance and our web app.\n\n    Motivation\nCommunication from applications to users is essential in web applications. On Web2 platforms this is often done by sending emails attached to the users account, but that isn't a good fit for Web3, which is wallet based. EPNS will allow users to get important information from us by providing only their wallet address.\n\n    Specification\nThis proposal will Create an EPNS account in which the DAO is the admin and the marketing & Growth workstream leaders have authority to make notifications. Notifications related to governance will include: proposal added to Snapshot, 24 hours remaining, and results after voting ends.\n\n    Benefits\nShapeshift gains the ability to deliver push notifications to users in a decentralized and private way.\n\n    Drawbacks\nMarketing & growth workstream leaders will have the additional responsibility of managing push notifications for the DAO.\n\n    Funding\nThis proposal requests the treasury pay 100 DAI for the account and around $50 of ETH for the gas fees.\n\n    Why Make a Proposal\n\n1. The DAO will need to execute transactions to deploy the channel (unless we decide to leave admin of the channel up to an EOA, which I don’t think we should do)\n\n2. The DAO can potentially delegate the ability to send push notifications from the channel to an EOA. If we decide to go this route, that should be specified. Otherwise, if we don’t specify and want to implement this in the future, it would require an additional proposal.",

      "title": "[SCP-78] Porter Finance Launch Partnership",
      "content": "## Summary\nThe purpose of this proposal is to make ShapeShift DAO an official launch partner of Porter Finance and to empower the TDMC (Treasury Management and Diversification Committee) to advise on the partnership. (Background on the TDMC)\n\nPorter Finance is creating a protocol for DAOs to borrow against their project tokens at fixed rates with no liquidations. We would be honored to have ShapeShift DAO as a launch partner. In return for launching with us, ShapeShift DAO will receive ownership in the protocol and have all fees waived.\n\n## Abstract\nPorter Finance will be launching our first products in late May: Simple and Convertible bonds. These instruments allow DAOs to borrow at fixed rates with no liquidation risk. Here’s how they work:\n\n### Simple bonds\nThis is our take on a simple DeFi bond. They are intended to be sold to investors at less than $1 and redeemable at maturity for $1. The difference between the sale price and $1 creates a return for the investors. To create Simple bonds, a DAO chooses some configurations (maturity date, amount, number and type of collateral tokens), deposits collateral, and mints the bonds to their wallet. The bonds are then sold via auction or OTC through the Porter Finance marketplace. At maturity, $1 is repaid for every bond sold. Refinancing can be handled through a new issuance.\n\n### Convertible bonds\nThis is our version of a convertible DeFi bond. It is functionally identical to Simple except it adds convertibility. This allows the lenders to exchange their bonds for some collateral tokens up until maturity as configured by the DAO. This gives a call option to the bond holders and lowers the rates the issuing DAO will pay.\n\nWe propose ShapeShift DAO use either Simple or Convert bonds to refinance a portion of its existing loans.\n\n## Motivation\nCurrently, ShapeShift DAO is taking on interest rate risk and liquidation risk while borrowing in Tetranode’s Rari Fuse pool. Earlier this year, while borrowing from the Fox and Frens Fuse pool, ShapeShift’s borrower interest rate went from single digits to 28% when lenders withdrew their capital from the pool. The variability of rates presents an existential risk to ShapeShift’s borrowing capabilities. In addition to interest rate risk, ShapeShift DAO also takes on liquidation risk. If the price of FOX were to fall precipitously during a flash crash, ShapeShift DAO’s lending position could be liquidated at ridiculously low prices, creating painful losses for the DAO.\n\nTaking out a loan through Porter will eliminate the interest rate risks and liquidation risks ShapeShift DAO currently faces.\n\nIn true web3 fashion, ShapeShift DAO will also receive ownership in the Porter protocol for being part of the launch cohort. This aligns Porter with ShapeShift DAO’s interests and also rewards ShapeShift DAO for their early support.\n\n## Specification\nThis proposal empowers the TDMC to advise on the use of the Porter Finance platform to achieve its mandate.\n\n### Issuance specifications\nIssuance specifications will be determined closer to launch date by the TDMC.\n\n### Compensation specifications\nWe will subsidize ShapeShift DAO’s debt offering with 5% APR of $PRTR, our future governance token, assuming a $100M FDV. For example, if ShapeShift DAO issues and sells $5M of bonds with a 1 year tenor, they will receive $250k in $PRTR (0.05*$5M = $250k). This equates to 0.25% of $PRTR FDV ($250k/$100M = 0.25%). This acts to subsidize ShapeShift DAO’s borrowing costs with a venture investment unavailable to other investors. We have not yet released our governance token, therefore ShapeShift DAO will receive either an NFT or ERC-20s that will be exchangeable for Porter tokens upon release.\n\nAdditionally, we will wave the 1% fee we would normally charge on any debt issued.\n\n## Benefits\n* ShapeShift DAO will be removing liquidation risk and interest rate risk from their lending positions.\n* ShapeShift DAO will receive ownership in the Porter protocol, aligning our interests.\n\n## Drawbacks\n* Borrowing at a fixed rate with no liquidation risk increases the risk a lender takes. Therefore, ShapeShift DAO may pay higher interest rates than what is offered in Fuse at the moment. Currently, ShapeShift’s is borrowing from Fuse at ~5% variable rate with ~400% collateralization. At the same amount of collateral, Porter can offer an ~11% fixed interest rate. \n* However, if ShapeShift DAO increases the amount of FOX they are willing to use as collateral, that borrow rate can decrease to **as low as 5.5% fixed**.\n* ShapeShift DAO could also reduce their borrowing cost by making their bonds convertible into FOX tokens. Currently, a Convert bond with 400% collateralization convertible into 1 FOX token ($0.38 at time of writing) would provide ShapeShift a 5% fixed interest rate.",

      "title": "[SCP-76] Join Water, the New Paradigm for Sustainable Liquidity",
      "content": "**Summary**\n\nWater is a new protocol currently under development from the 1Hive community that was designed for the sole purpose of providing sustainable liquidity for governance tokens. Water is assembling the first cohort of projects to help launch Water, and ShapeShift DAO is invited to the pool party.\n\n**Abstract**\n\nThe concept for Water was inspired in part by the success of the token swap and joint LPing 1Hive and ShapeShift DAO executed with $FOX/$HNY in 2021. After this swap, 1Hive received a lot of interest from other projects to execute similar token swaps and joint LPs; more demand than the HNY supply could meet. The idea for Water emerged from this demand: a token specifically designed to be paired with DAO’s governance tokens and LP’d on Honeyswap. Projects that are accepted by the Water DAO (initially a multisig composed of 2 members of each launch partner) provide $100k of their project’s token (to get started), $100k of Water is minted, and $200k is LP’d on Honeyswap by Water DAO. If a project ever wants to rage quit, Water DAO will send them 85% of however many of their tokens are currently in the LP (15% penalty). Assuming things go well, these tokens will remain in Honeyswap providing much needed liquidity for FOX at no ongoing expense to the DAO, and after launch we can consider increasing the amount of liquidity in the pool.\n\n*Water tokenomics:*\n\nWater will only be minted in order to provide liquidity for DAOs, subject to the approval of the Water multisig committee. The only way to acquire Water will be to buy it. Water will not be airdropped nor rewarded to community members. Why would somebody want to buy Water? Water will act as an index token for DAOs; so if you like DAOs, water is a great way to get exposure to a vetted basket. Regardless, even if there is zero demand for Water, it will still serve its primary purpose of enabling approved DAOs to increase their liquidity on DEXs without the need for expensive farming programs. If the price of the majority of the governance tokens participating increases, Water’s price will increase and will bring FOX with it. And ofc, vice versa.\n\nTo learn all about water, check out this excellent proposal and discussion from 1Hive’s @Paul: [Water💧 Shared Liquidity Proposal](https://forum.1hive.org/t/water-shared-liquidity-proposal/5019)\n\nHere are the other projects that have already expressed interest in participating:\n\n- 1Hive\n- Shapeshift\n- BrightID\n- Giveth\n- Panvala\n- Opolis\n- Agave\n- Token Engineering Commons\n\n**Specification**\n\nIn order to participate in Water, two members of the ShapeShift community must be appointed to represent the DAO on the Water multisig committee. I’ve nominated myself as well as another fox who prefers to remain pseudonymous in public forums, but is an active community member, large FOX holder, and known by the others on the water multisig committee. These representatives will be entrusted to act in the best interest of the ShapeShift DAO when deciding whether to approve or reject transactions proposed to the Water multisig.\n\nWilly: 0x1D01A2FefB8883A5cfB8c77B19d9b96794581288\nFox #2: 0x1a3AD6064528b8899ECB85867Da809ffCA05A04a\n\nNext, ShapeShift DAO and other launch partners will each transfer $100,000 of their DAO’s governance token (ie. FOX) to the Water multisig on Gnosis Chain. The Water multisig committee will then mint 100,000 Water to deposit alongside each partner’s token to a liquidity pool on Honeyswap.\n\nIf ShapeShift or any other partner ever wants to exit the program, the Water multisig will withdraw their liquidity and return 85% of the tokens that were in the LP at the time of withdrawal (15% penalty).\n\n**Benefits**\n\n1. Participating in Water will increase FOX liquidity on Gnosis Chain at no upfront or ongoing cost to the DAO.\n2. FOX will be included in one the first index tokens for DAOs.\n3. If the experiment is successful, more projects will join, and ShapeShift DAO will have played a critical role in launching a new paradigm for sustainable liquidity.\n\n**Drawbacks**\n\n1. FOX’s price will have additional correlation to the price of Water and the price of other participating projects’ tokens.\n2. 15% penalty if we ever want to exit.\n3. Water is an experimental protocol, and in a worst case scenario the price of Water could go to zero and we could lose the $100,000 FOX.",

      "title": "[SCP-75] Establishing and funding the Marketing/Growth & Globalization Workstream",
      "content": "Summary\n\nThis proposal establishes and funds the Marketing, Growth and Globalization workstream, which will focus on the creation, implementation, and optimization of marketing and growth campaigns/initiatives for the ShapeShift DAO. This workstream creation includes the designation of Toasty, Hunt, and Lindsaylou as collaborative workstream leaders. The proposal will furthermore fund the inclusion of the following additional members: 6 current part/full-time marketing contributors, 6 current part/full-time LatAm contributors, 5 globalization contributors, and 3 contributors engaging in the development and deployment of the ShapeShift DAO Education project.\n\nAbstract\n\nIn establishing the Marketing, Growth, & Globalization workstream, the current marketing workstream as proposed in [SCP-51] here: Snapshot will be discontinued, and the funding for said proposal will be revoked. This dissolution of the marketing workstream, and establishment of Marketing, Growth, and Globalization, will resolve numerous points of confusion and overlap within the current marketing workflow. In doing so, the DAO will save in excess of 19,000USD/month. Furthermore, This will provide short and long-term goals as well as a plan of execution for current marketing workstream contributors to meet and maintain effective product launch/marketing/brand standards.\n\nThis proposal establishes and funds the following contributors in their roles as described below:\n\nToasty: Co-lead and manage the growth workstream and its strategies in outside partnerships and integrations. This includes but is not limited to executing DAO marketing requirements, overseeing and managing the public voice and branding of the DAO and its community presence, as well as leading internal integration strategies, DAO event coordination, and cross-stream collaboration. Further responsibilities include the planning and implementation process for distributing marketing and communications content across all channels, performance analysis, ad and budget management, and understanding business development requirements. It is an inherent responsibility of this role to function effectively as a leader in growth, branding, partnerships, event coordination, globalization, and information workstream/project efforts.\n\nHunt: Co-lead providing full support as-needed for the entirety of the workstreams directive both in strategizing and implementation of the growth and globalization’s workstream responsibilities and projects. This includes functioning effectively as a leader in growth/marketing, branding, partnerships, globalization, and education project efforts.\n\nLindsay: LindsayLou will continue as Head of Communications, a role she held in centralized ShapeShift and has held for two months in the DAO. Lindsaylou demonstrated considerable results during her tenure, growing share of voice against competitors from 15% to 30% (equal to Coinbase during the decentralization launch), and helped earn a 2B gross media audience in just two days following the DAO and airdrop announcements (she wrote press releases as well as contributed articles, blogs, customer service content, reviewed eblasts, and added to social content). Her scope would include press releases, media relations, orchestrating product and message launches across all contributors to launch success, editorial support, and acting as communications lead for the DAO (complete document & description here: Proposal metrics - Google Docs ).\n\nTheSmith: Leader of LatAm Labs, and co-leader of globalization. TheSmith will focus on strategizing with hunt and toasty to develop and deploy branding and growth frameworks targeting Latin American demographics.\n\nVlad: Co-leader of LatAm labs. Focuses on marketing strategy for the entire marketing workstream with specific leadership responsibilities as a co-leader of LatAm labs. Continues to contribute effectively, strategizing and executing marketing strategies, while onboarding ethan and hpayne as marketing managers to enable effective and scalable marketing/community building techniques.\n\nLPX: Co-Leader of Globalization, providing full support of the document repository / translation platform, continued management and improvement between global translators and the Engineering workstream through the smooth integration of the continuous localization platform synced to ShapeShift Github, continued translator acquisition and bounty payments for additional languages to be added to the ShapeShift app, keeping track and ensuring ShapeShift app’s locale files are up to date in the 7 languages currently available as well as future added languages, management and continued guidance of the newly formed Korean team, re-purposing of oneDAO to create a Korea-focused education platform, ShapeShift and FOX-related content feed aggregation project for constant translation work for GlobalFOX members with Firebomb.\n\nFirebomb: Tooling to import more content from the ShapeShift helpdesk for translations. French translations of the app.shapeshift.com alpha. French translations of the current bounties for the shapeshift.com blog documents.\n\nJpanam: Tooling to import more content from the ShapeShift helpdesk for translations. Spanish translations of the app.shapeshift.com alpha. Spanish translations of the current bounties for the shapeshift.com blog documents. Jpanam also works with LatAm in regular workflow and is compensated for those contributions as well.\n\nETHan: Community Growth Lead - Providing support for the entirety of the Marketing workflow, including the management of Web3/Social teams, organic cross-community relationship building/networking, and any additional resource management and strategy development alongside Hunt, Toasty, and Lindsay (instagram, FB, email).\n\nHpayne: Marketing manager - Responsibilities include providing support for the entirety of the Marketing workflow (as-needed), while continuing to maintain newsletter workflow, blog workflow, and any other as-needed content help required by the workstream/workflow for product launches, features, and integrations. Hpayne will work closely with Arina and Lindsay in optimizing and deploying an effective content creation and distribution strategy for product launches.\n\nArina: Content Creation & Distribution Lead - Responsible for the development and management of all marketing content, working closely with Lindsay, while furthermore developing a network of high-quality and high-impact distribution points (and strategy for utilizing said network of distribution points).\n\nRon/PTT: Video Streaming & Management - Continues to be not only responsible for Video streaming all possible public calls for the ShapeShift DAO, but reliable and consistent as well. Ron will work closely with toasty, hunt, and graymachine to optimize our video streaming strategy while also taking on the project of migrating all activity to the official ShapeShift youtube account as/when access is granted to the marketing workstream.\n\nAngel: Web 3 Content Distribution - Part-time contributor continuing to maintain telegram, odyssey, & hive, while expanding into further efforts with the help/training of @thesmith and @vlad. Furthermore, responsibility for optimization and maintenance of these mediums of web3/social community building.\n\nSeth: Education project core contributor. He will be starting this new term with a larger amount of responsibility, and will be learning to lead the team in the coming six-month term. His contributions to the DAO and furthermore the education team continue to provide value. Seth will proceed forward with the proposed added responsibilities in the new term with added hours/compensation.\n\nJess: Education project core contributor. With a strong background in education, Jess consults inbound education/learning related inquiries for workstream leaders while maintaining core Education project team goals.\n\nTwells: Education project core contributor. Twells is a new contributor on the Education workstream and has both a strong background in education as well as in DAO contribution. He has already proven to be a great asset for the core education project team.\n\nMotivation:\n\nThe current Growth and Globalization contributors have provided the DAO with value not only by meeting stated expectations and goals, but by going above and beyond in effort, dedication and value addition while working for the ShapeShift DAO. This provides motivation in proposing the renewal of current positions within the workstream (including the addition of Lindsaylou and Twells). Specifically, Growth leadership, the LatAm team, the Education project, and Globalization workflow have continued to meet stated goals for the current and active term, while providing inbound support for any other DAO workstream leader, contributor, and the public while holding regular public meetings on Discord public voice channels. Regular community updates on progress, prioritization, friction points in workflow, and updates in the contributors within the Growth and Globalization workstream have been held during the entirety of the current and soon-to end term.\n\nUnfortunately, the Marketing workstream leader (@petecoin) left his role at the DAO abruptly, without significant warning to the contributors within his workstream. With that being said, @Toasty accepted the responsibility of becoming interim workstream leader for marketing and has been provided with the task of maintaining the workstream contributors that were left without a significant amount of direction. With little to no specific instruction for contributor responsibilities, current contributors were in need of greater certainty regarding their position with the ShapeShift DAO moving forward. For these stated reasons, I @hunt am proposing that the Marketing workstream be combined with the Growth and Globalization workstream to form a highly effective marketing, growth and globalization workstream/workflow. With the addition of @lindsaylou and the co-leadership of @toasty, I believe the consolidation is the most effective and valuable solution for the DAO moving forward. Furthermore after careful screening of the entirety of the Marketing workstream, the conclusion has been made by @Toasty and myself @hunt, that contributors that are willing to move forward with joining Growth and Globalization are fully capable in the agreed upon role (whether a new role, or continuing an optimized version of their old role with the Marketing workstream) and the team will be highly effective in stated efforts and goals.\n\nSpecification:\n\nThis proposal both hires following contributors: Leadership/Growth (@Toasty, @Hunt, & @Lindsaylou), Global (LPX, FireBomb, & jpanam), Marketing (@arina, @ethan, @hpayne, @angel, @sh0x, @ron/ptt), LatAM (@TheSmith, @jpanam, @mr bear, @rohek, @guilherme, & @vlad), and Education (ShapeShift DAO Education Project; @JessOtterlyHopeful, @twells, & @IrohDW), and funds the workstream and its projects with 126,300$ USD/month for 6 months from May 1st 2022 to November 1st 2022 as well as 20,000$ USD for one-time payment budget items.\n\nGrowth and Globalization Budget: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-eCZWWVHk3YEV_9R3-KhxncfL9Ct2coK1PiyDma7x98/edit?usp=sharing (All unused funds will be returned to the treasury)\n\nWorkstream Goals/KPIs: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Mmt2_bjo8tVafzEqvrcBRE_XLSaF5zx4eXGRcjD_iqw/\n\nMarketing: Define, utilize and optimize a multi-tiered product launch focused marketing plan. Further, marketing will be responsible for mirroring and maintaining the same web3/social strategy implemented by the LatAm marketing team through hands-on training and execution of systematic content distribution and community building. The team will further develop the marketing plan and strategy once we have access to ShapeShift accounts including but not limited to email/autopilot, instagram, and facebook.\n\nGlobalization: In the current term, Globalization has continued to maintain translation services on an as-needed basis for incoming requests from other workstreams/workflows. Beyond maintaining basic duties and responsibilities in terms of translation services, the following document and plan for an Asia focused expansion effort can be found here: https://hackmd.io/@GlobalFOX/strategic-asian-expansion\n\nLatAM: Branding on social/web3 platforms while planning and proposing event sponsorship & presence at LatAM conferences/events (currently talking to and planning for bitconf after a very successful ETHRio). Furthermore exploring AMA’s, podcast features, youtube features further as @thesmith and @vlad continue to excel not only as marketing managers for ShapeShift DAO latam efforts - but as speakers and business development driven contributors.\n\nLatAM Presentation Slides Link: https://www.canva.com/design/DAE9CQ52pj4/ziOqgAOEOLwkWLA6yuMtQg/view?website#2\n\nLatAM Reports:\n\nJan.: https://forum.shapeshift.com/t/latam-report-january-2022/109\n\nFeb.: https://forum.shapeshift.com/t/latam-report-community-calls-and-eth-rio/1223\n\nMarch: LatAm Monthly Report - https://forum.shapeshift.com/t/latam-monthly-report-03-27-2022/1302\n\nShapeShift DAO Education Goals, Workflow, Values, & Team Agreement: https://www.notion.so/shapeshift/Education-Project-de54b8f9055f40e89ac2155bb9f921bc\n\nMarketing Notion & Workflow/Information: https://www.notion.so/shapeshift/Marketing-67848d1dc42246adbe2b4a8d26ed1144\n\nGrowth Notion & Workflow/Information: https://www.notion.so/shapeshift/Growth-Marketing-Globalization-18315037becf4c26b9a9f26377e2a628\n\nBenefits\n\nThis proposal creates a single, unified workstream that works under/towards growth initiatives as defined in this proposal. Branding, marketing, globalization, and partnerships working together to create a unified approach in determining the best growth strategy will allow for an effective alignment in order to produce and maintain efficient growth-focused projects and partnerships.\n\nDrawbacks:\n\nThis workstream merges Growth and Globalization with Marketing and will require a larger amount of leadership time in order to effectively manage the entirety of the team, including the projects within the workstream. This transition may require optimization of existing strategy within the workstream and its projects, and further will require leadership to provide training to members of the workstream.",

      "content": "**Mission:** Delight and educate customers as they navigate and experience The ShapeShift DAO while gathering their feedback on their experience.\n\n**The poll is at the end of the proposal to vote on this proposal.**\n\nChanges from previous funding round (***PAY ATTENTION TO THIS SECTION***):\n\n1. This funding round is requesting an additional 2 months to the 6 month proposal due to Workstream Leader - cryptohmeg’s maternity leave that falls right at the time a new proposal would be due. To prevent interruptions in the team’s work and payroll, we’d like to request a one-time addition of 2 months to our proposal. Starting in 2023, our proposals will be 6 months at a time.\n\n2. Total funding request is approx 7000 USD less per month than the initial proposal. This is due to cutting back on support staff, our Data Reporting Manager role dissolving into 4 different roles, and reducing the Workstream Leader’s salary, benefits and scope.\n\n3. Workstream Leader’s role and salary have changed significantly. Responsibilities have been reduced to payroll, proposals, and leadership management. Other ancillary responsibilities have been passed to leadership team members (laid out in revised job descriptions below). Salary has been reduced by roughly 50%.\n\n4. After SSMarc’s recent resignation, we have decided to divy up his workload among the remaining leadership team members. A salary adjustment has been made to match responsibility changes. This means we will be tentatively removing an entire position and trying out delegating the task list among the team. I have set aside an extra $200/month in the budget to compensate agents on any special projects they might be tasked with because of this change.\n\n**Performance highlights from our first proposal:**\n\n* Trust Pilot score increased from 3.7 > 4.0 stars!\n* Total Resolution Time was reduced by 80%!\n* New Product and Tokenomic communication lines were opened and organized!\n* New DeFi training workbook was dreamed up and is now 75% complete!\n* 13 new helpdesk articles have been published!\n\n**Goals:**\n\n* Create and maintain a self-service helpdesk using Zendesk.\n* Provide a streamlined ticketing system that operates 7 days a week (via Zendesk and Discord)\n* Sustain a 48 hour first response time for all user inquiries.\n* Increase total number of mobile app and Trust Pilot reviews.\n* Host community trainings on customer support.\n* Consistent data reporting on customer support interactions, satisfaction, feedback, and bug reports.\n\n**Success Metrics:**\n\n* Monthly Quality Assurance score 95%+\n* Monthly Customer Satisfaction Score 95%+\n* Helpdesk Content audited and updated monthly.\n* Monthly Customer Support Workstream calls are held to review product changes, support protocol changes, and quality assurance awards.\n* 5+ app or Trust Pilot reviews each month.\n\n**Budget: [DAO Support Budget Worksheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tnsJfzk6yt-cD4b4N1k-FrEmmEBUKZbRBJy8bi4dEbs/edit#gid=710563007)**\n\n* Payouts will happen on schedule with DAO workstreams\n* Unused Chua Award payments will roll to the next funding round for the workstream\n\nWhat are Chua Awards? Myleene Chua was an agent with the ShapeShift Customer Support team for 2.5 years. She passed Sept 17, 2021. We wanted to remember her as she was a longstanding member of the team. She was sweet, kind, and loyal to her role. Now our monthly performance awards will be named after her. <3\n\n**Staffing:**\n\n* Workstream Leader (parttime) - 1 @cryptohmeg\n  * JD: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1a4_sMA81xnLnbBk-6HcDNjZgtterOWh2qZmElM35k7E/edit\n  * The goal of this position is to “keep the lights on”, ie: pay vendors, proposal management, leadership team communication, and high-level general needs. My original WS Leader proposal talks of moving my position from full to parttime and I’m thrilled to announce we are making this move in the workstream to improve efficiency and cost savings, while accommodating my new family life changes: https://forum.shapeshift.com/t/assign-cryptohmeg-as-workstream-leader-of-the-customer-support-workstream/590\n\n* Helpdesk Manager - 1 @mogie\n  * JD: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QwcMGzApZvqajegzZ_Pi-PRYXbVlzWMSjzW1ecuYmRg/edit\n  * The helpdesk manager creates and oversees the creation, editing, and auditing process of our helpdesk content.\n  * The Helpdesk Manager will also manage all US-timezone product meetings that require support representation (ie: No/No Go’s, Governance Calls, etc)\n\nThis role is also on the “leadership team” of Customer Support.\n\n* Support Staff Managers - 2 @ss-jules & @donna\n  * JD: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OTr0TF17JiBaV1qo882UjelNqEjXW0UGbLNhW1Slea8/edit\n  * Managers’ main role is to ensure quality support and training are provided to all support agents.\n  * This proposal period one of the main special focuses of this duo will be cross-team communication. Both have built the foundations between Tokenomics and Product. This period we will continue to streamline product releases through this communication line.\n\nThis role is also on the “leadership team” of Customer Support.\n\n* Support Agents - 6 @ss-cj @carminaSS @foxrain @ace.SS @miguel\n  * JD: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Uh4tm7uwZtGLMXLtVUVQKfR79dMHMOC_qOoGkk7PWI0/edit\n  * We have reduced our agent headcount from 7 > 5 to reflect our support needs at this time. I have added in the budget an additional headcount in the event we need to hire a new agent in the coming months.\n\n**Quality Assurance:**\n\nEach month all agent’s work will be evaluated by their manager to determine their QA score. The process includes reviewing up to 10 tickets each month from each agent and scoring them based on our custom built QA system below.\n\n**Vendors:** \n\nAll positions except for the Helpdesk Manager and workstream leader will continue to be contracted through Liberty Virtual Assistants. \n\nThe main vendor cost is for Zendesk. ShapeShift, Inc is grandfathered into a legacy Enterprise Plan with Zendesk which means we have access to the Zendesk Suite for only $125/pp billed monthly. \n\n**Total Funding for 8 months:**\n\n**Total funding needed broken down by month of proposal:** \n\n\n![image](ipfs://QmQ5pHo5xu4iAqg7iEa6Bz8VD4nFajTh4pwLy8YeDzsL1P)\n",

      "title": "[SCP-70] Infrastructure Budget Proposal Addendum",
      "content": "**Objective:**\n\nExtend funding for the relationship with TaxiStake, such that the Shapeshift DAO may continue to independently operate its own infrastructure via the TaxiStake relationship so long as both parties see fit.\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nCurrently, the Shapeshift DAO leverages a cloud provider account supplied by TaxiStake in order to operate the primary instance of Unchained, which is the blockchain indexing platform used to power the Shapeshift v2 web application. Since February 24, 2022, the Taxistake Unchained instance has served 99% of all Production Unchained traffic (these endpoints are occasionally cut back and forth between the Fox Foundation-controlled Unchained instance when it is prudent to avoid disruption to service, i.e. major maintenance operations to one cluster or the other). The terms of the first iteration of the infrastructure budget proposal, passed earlier this year, are expiring, and a new arrangement needs to be established with some adjustments provided by the wisdom that experience has provided over the last few months. Perhaps most significantly, a scalable, more flexible reimbursement model needs to be implemented in order to allow both parties to respond organically to increases in cost as additional blockchain integrations are added over time.\n\n**Specification:**\n\nThe tenets of the original governance proposal are outlined here:\n\nhttps://forum.shapeshift.com/t/scp-43-infrastructure-budget-proposal-official-ideation-thread/847\n\nThis proposal is simply a continuation of the original arrangement, with the following adjustments:\n\n- The reimbursement currency will continue to be issued in stable coins, but is not limited to DAI. At this time, USDC is favored.\n\n- The reimbursement channel will executed via Colony, and not a Sablier stream. This enables the Engineering Workstream leader to approve and adjust reimbursements on a monthly basis as appropriate, and for the payments to be more easily and transparently allocated to the Engineering Workstream’s operating budget. This arrangement is more flexible than Sablier, and provides additional transparency and oversight by the Engineering Workstream leader, as well as being a piece of native tooling already used by the DAO to orchestrate DAO member payment services internally.\n\n- The monthly budget for infrastructure is increased to a minimum of $2000 USD, and the maximum determined by a schedule aligning with the expansion of blockchain integrations as per the product roadmap:\n\nQ2 2022: $3000/month (Cosmos, BTC)\nQ3 2022: $3500/month (UTXOs)\nQ4 2022: $4000/month (XRP)\n\n- The Infrastructure budget will merge with the Engineering Workstream budget, and become subject to the same approval and renewal cycle as its parent. It will be subject to the same estimation, adjustment, and allocation processes on an annual basis alongside the Engineering Workstream budget.\n\n**Motivation/Benefits:**\n\nVery early in its life, the DAO has achieved true decentralization of its back-end infrastructure. This arrangement enables the DAO to operate independently of any centralized third parties.\n\nAdditionally, the DAO is empowered to leverage both its own infrastructure, and that provided by the Fox Foundation, in order to avoid disruption to service during maintenance operations to Unchained endpoints.\n\n**Drawbracks:**\n\nNone, other than what was outlined in the original proposal. Rather than being dependent on Shapeshift AG, the DAO depends on a healthy relationship with TaxiStake, and for TaxiStake to also have a healthy relationship with the regulatory and legislative entities in which it operates.\n\n**Vote:**\n\nIf you for “For” this proposal, you are endorsing the following points:\n\n- TaxiStake continues to thoroughly fulfill its obligation to the DAO in supplying cloud provider services,\n- The maximum budget for this relationship should be increased over time in order to accommodate additional features and cryptocurrencies being added to the Web v2 platform in the upcoming business year,\n- The vector for reimbursement in this relationship shall be moved to Colony,\n- TaxiStake and the Engineering Workstream leader will have the authority to continue, renew, and adjust the arrangement in perpetuity.\n\nIf you vote “Against”, you are indicating that you do not want the DAO to be able to run its own infrastructure, or perhaps just not via the existing relationship with TaxiStake.",

      "title": "[SCP-72] Funding & Leadership of Tokenomics Through June 2022 ",
      "content": "SUMMARY:\n\nThe ShapeShift community approved the creation and funding of the Tokenomics Workstream in November 2021 (SCP-40). This measure elected Kent as the Workstream’s leader, and provided a budget for the Workstream through March 31, 2022.\n\nWith that date quickly approaching, it’s time to outline the next phase. If passed, this proposal will fund the Tokenomics Workstream through June 30th, 2022, and re-elect Kent as its leader.\n\n*Note*: \nFor deeper discussion about the Workstream's performance and initial goals, please see this proposal's Ideation post: https://forum.shapeshift.com/t/scp-69-funding-leadership-of-tokenomics-through-june-2022/1295\n\nQ2 GOALS:\n\n1a.) Reach our current goal of $10,000,000 worth of stablecoins in our treasury.\n\nThis seems very realistic! We’re averaging $100,000/day via our FOX/USDC bond, and already have $3.5M worth of stablecoins. Even factoring in $500,000/month for payroll, we should be able to reach $10,000,000 by the end of June assuming the current bond dynamics hold firm. There may be other ways to generate stablecoins as well, such as executing arbitrage strategies in our AngelVault.\n\n1b.) Expand our diversification beyond stablecoins. Once we’ve hit our goal, we’ll be in a good position to add other tokens to our treasury. Reasonable initial targets would be “blue chips” such as ETH and wrapped BTC. (Note that we’re already accumulating ETH via our LP token buybacks).\n\n2.) Complete the DAOshboard.\n\nWe’ve already got most of the components in place; let’s put it all together!\n\n3.) Contribute to new value-accrual mechanisms.\n\nThis is intentionally broad, as it covers a multitude of initiatives, including FOXy, TMDC deliberations, and vFOX, as well as other strategic initiatives that will likely arise as a result of the Tokenomics and its many contributors (similar to how the Workstream contributed to new revenue streams in the prior quarter). I anticipate that this area will take up the lion’s share of our attention in the coming months.\n\n4.) Continue to increase awareness of the DAO.\n\nIn our first term I was able to promote ShapeShift via a variety of channels, including speaking engagements at in-person events (ETHDENVER and Ethereal), as well as via media interviews (via Decrypt). This is arguably invaluable in terms of making both users and potential contributors aware of what we’re doing. As such, I aim to build further outreach momentum–with help of our newly-minted PR rockstar Lindsay–in Q2.\n\nBUDGET STUFF:\n\nI’m pleased to report that of the $50,000 allocated for Workstream bounties and contributions, only $4300 was spent during the initial phase. Thus, we currently have 45,700 USDC in the Tokenomics Colony sub-treasury. As such, I’m requesting 4300 USDC (to be allocated at the beginning of the term in April) to bring us back to an even 50,000 USDC for Q2. That gives us just over 16,500/month for the next quarter, which should be more than sufficient to accomplish our goals.\n\nWORKSTREAM LEADER COMPENSATION:\n\nThe original Tokenomics proposal included a conditional performance bonus rather than a salary:\n\n“The Workstream Leader has no associated salary for this first term. However, should the Workstream meet its goals over the following four months, the community will have the option of rewarding its Leader a $45,500 performance bonus.”\n\nAs described in the post I linked above, I believe the Workstream has executed on its original goals and performed in a manner that’s helped strengthen the DAO’s financial position. This proposal’s budget includes the payout of that one-time bonus.\n\nThis proposal also includes a monthly Workstream Leader salary of $14,000 for the following three quarters.\n\nTotal through June 30th, 2022: $4300 (Workstream contributor/bounty allocation, payable in April) + $45500 (Workstream Leader performance bonus, payable in April) + $42,000 (Workstream Leader monthly salary for three months) = $91,800.\n\nPOTENTIAL DRAWBACKS:\n\nImagine a ShapeShift DAO where there was only an unofficial, non-funded, Tokenomics Workstream. In this scenario, a lot of meaningful work would still get done; the TMDC would still function (its budget is not a subset of Tokenomics), and contributors could still find myriad ways to collaborate–all without needing to spend funds from the DAO treasury on Tokenomics functionality or leadership.\n\nWHAT THIS VOTE DOES:\n\n1.) Fund the Tokenomics Workstream with $91,800 as described above.\n\n2.) Re-elect Kent as the Tokenomics Workstream Leader through June 30, 2022.",

      "title": "[SCP-69] ShapeShift DAO to DAO ecosystem treasury",
      "content": "(1) Summary - The ShapeShift DAO is in a unique position when it comes to deal flow of new decentralized projects and DAOs, as well as an opportunity to collaborate with and support the very ecosystem the DAO wishes to provide a decentralized global interface for. One of the best ways the ShapeShift DAO can leverage its treasury to support this, is to form and fund a sub-DAO focused on DAO to DAO relationships supporting, partnering, and investing into the ecosystem the ShapeShift DAO wishes to see evolve.\n\n(2) Abstract - The ShapeShift DAO community votes to create a Sub-DAO D2D treasury focused on the growth of the decentralized and aligned ShapeShift DAO ecosystem. This would be a commitment from the DAO to fund this treasury with $1 million USDC (or part USDC/FOX and equivalent amounts), and as part of that receive 90% governance rights to the vFOX governance token (venture FOX). The other 10% of the vFOX supply would remain in the sub-DAO treasury to be distributed as incentives to the sub-DAO committee which would source and vote on the allocation of sub-DAO assets (or to be used ultimately for whatever vFOX governance wishes). This would give the ShapeShift DAO 100% of governance rights at the genesis of the vFOX sub-DAO.\n\n(3) Motivation - There are a number of motivations to create the vFOX DAO to DAO ecosystem treasury:\n\n(a) The ShapeShift DAO has a large and growing treasury and is in a great position to invest it. By investing in up-and-coming decentralized projects with which the DAO wants to partner, not only will closer relationships between the ShapeShift DAO and its product(s) be formed, but the DAO will also participate in the potential upside of investing early on into the global decentralized ecosystem that the ShapeShift DAO is already betting on and supporting. The potential success of such a model was put on display when the TMDC allocated to SILO in its genesis event, however long term this type of speculative investment is more suited for a dedicated vehicle (such as vFOX) rather than as part of TMDC’s mandate and duties for the larger ShapeShift DAO treasury.\n\n(b) Sourcing deal flow and partnering with various projects in the ecosystem with potential bright futures helps empower the ShapeShift DAO to buidl the best possible decentralized interface for the world.\n\n(c) The ShapeShift DAO can help foster the wider growth of the decentralized crypto ecosystem by making sure to support projects that otherwise might not get the chance of existence. Furthermore, the ShapeShift DAO community can also offer invaluable support via a group of connected angels that can co-invest alongside the vFOX treasury.\n\n(d) By putting ShapeShift DAO treasury assets to work in this sub-DAO format, the treasury receives vFOX which it can use as a treasury asset managed by TMDC and larger DAO treasury governance.\n\n(4) Specification - The ShapeShift DAO will spawn a sub-DAO (vFOX) and commit to funding the sub-DAO treasury up to $1 million worth of USDC and/or FOX. The vFOX governance token will be issued back to the ShapeShift DAO treasury, holding 90% of the supply of vFOX with 10% held by the vFOX treasury for future incentives and allocation at the discretion of FOX holders (who will hold all vFOX governance rights at that point through the DAO’s allocation). The funds do not need to be released to the sub-DAO treasury all at once, instead only as needed based on token positions and deal flow of new opportunities. The goal of the sub-DAO will be to deploy/allocate those funds over the next 6-12 months in order to prove its thesis out, including always holding a long position on FOX in regards to any FOX allocated to it.\n\nThe ShapeShift DAO can fund the vFOX treasury anyway it wishes, but preferably this would be done as a combo of FOX and USDC as the treasury will want to acquire and be long FOX regardless (perhaps even long term turning into a liquidity sink for FOX if vFOX governance voted to allocate revenue that way). Funds will be sent from the ShapeShift DAO treasury to the vFOX treasury up to the $1 million limit passed in this proposal as necessitated based on deal flow/ vFOX treasury taking positions. For the treasury to raise any further funds, it would have to ask for more as necessary from the DAO treasury in future governance proposals and it may or may not mint more vFOX to that effect based on governance.\n\nThe first act of vFOX governance should be electing a committee/management team whose purpose should be managing sourcing and closing of dealflow, as well as sub-DAO treasury defi positions on behalf of the vFOX treasury and thus managing the mutli-sig of the sub-DAO - it is proposed as part of this proposal (to accelerate vFOX hitting the ground running) that this first team be a committee of 3 (appointed for a term of 6 months to start) including JonisJon, WillyFox, and Kent who will be paid both with long term streaming contracts of vFOX (2% of total vFOX each streamed over 3 years or until revoked by vFOX treasury) from the incentive pool of the vFOX treasury as well as a yearly (committee shared) performance fee of 20% based on treasury gains year to year (USD denominated).\n\nImportantly, based on discussion in the incubation period of this proposal a 20% YoY benchmark will be applied when evaluating the performance tranche, this is to simulate the opportunity cost of putting that same capital into Anchor at 20% (a relatively conservative DeFi strategy for stables). This benchmark may need to be revisited by governance at a later time based on how “normal” DeFi yields change over time. Thus no performance will be awarded on the first 20% gain of capital supplied to the vFOX sub-DAO. For clarity, this performance will be calculated based on the native assets supplied to the sub-DAO (so vs USDC when supplied that way and vs FOX when supplied that way), any credited performance will then be translated into USDC values to appropriately combine the total performance value.\n\nThe committee will be responsible for the full life cycle of the treasury, including sourcing deals, establishing and supporting partnerships with vFOX backed DAO’s/protocols on behalf of the ShapeShift DAO, maintenance and strategy of the vFOX treasury positions, communicating to the larger vFOX holder community (primarily the ShapeShift DAO community of FOX holders itself), and multi-sig execution for those various tasks. The committee will communicate on a regular basis on its activities as well as engage regularly with the community to keep the larger FOX community involved.\n\nThere should be little limitation on the vFOX treasury strategies that are deployed by the committee except sticking generally to supporting the larger decentralized ecosystem, forming partnerships that benefit the ShapeShift DAO, and generally deploying strategies that are effectively long FOX. In addition to allocating treasury towards new and emerging decentralized projects, it should also include the ability to do things like (responsibly) going leverage long fox and engaging in experimental high risk/high return defi strategies.\n\nIf the vFOX treasury proves itself effective over the first deployment of $1 million across the ecosystem then it may make sense for the ShapeShift DAO to increase its funding in a second phase (but of course based on results and in relation to DAO revenues and treasury position at the time).\n\n(5) Benefits - The benefits of this proposal will be the creation of a more nimble sub-DAO treasury which can be used to effectively put the DAO’s funds to work on supporting the wider decentralized ecosystem, forming partnerships that benefit and support the ShapeShift DAO’s product(s), and participating in potential upside of the ecosystem. The DAO will also gain a new treasury asset in the vFOX governance token which can be allocated and used by the DAO as needed.\n\n(6) Drawbacks - the Drawbacks of this proposal related to allocating a substantial amount of treasury funds that may go towards speculative plays supporting the ecosystem and other DeFi strategies that could mean a loss of treasury funds if on the whole the winning strategies don’t outweigh the losing ones. This could mean the elected committee is not doing a good job administering the vFOX sub-DAO treasury, however FOX holders controlling the majority of vFOX governance means they can easily replace those committee members as needed if they are not performing up to what the community would expect.\n\n(7) Vote - For - a FOR vote indicates an approval of creating the vFOX sub-DAO, funding it up to $1 mil over time as needed based on deal flow, forming the initial committee with JonisJon, WillyFox, and Kent elected to serve for the first 6 months, and rewarding the committee as per the specification of this proposal.\n\nAgainst - an AGAINST vote indicates not going forward with creating the vFOX sub-DAO at this time.",

      "content": "## Foxchain x Coinbase Cloud: Support Proposal\n\n# Summary\n\nCoinbase Cloud understands that launching networks is a difficult task and doing so successfully requires reliable partners. We have a comprehensive cross-functional team that would partner with ShapeShift to enable best practices in design, build, ecosystem development, GTM, and positioning.\n\n# Abstract\n\nShapeShift DAO is looking to launch Foxchain, a data availability network, on Tendermint with the objective of decentralizing blockchain data. Foxchain is a purpose-built blockchain designed to store metadata for every blockchain supported by ShapeShift. Operators running CoinStacks register their CoinStacks in Foxchain to earn passive income. Users find and connect to CoinStacks with Foxchain. There is no cost for anyone to use the network. Users can also delegate their FOX tokens to validators they believe are serving the community well.\n\nOur proposal addresses the terms of engagement and deliverables that would govern a partnership between ShapeShift DAO and Coinbase Cloud with regards to Foxchain and the infrastructure required to power the network.\n\n# Motivation\n\nWe are beyond excited to be exploring this opportunity with you all.

party.\n\n# Benefits\n\nLong-Term Collaboration with Coinbase Cloud\n\nOur deep Tendermint-based protocol expertise has allowed us to implement best practices including but not limited to:\n\n* Remote Signer for Security\n  * Running Tendermint infrastructure requires running a remote signer, which Coinbase Cloud does through our managed service provider (MSP)\n    * Remote signers are one of the most secure ways to generate private keys and sign transactions\n* Managed Service Provider\n  * Coinbase Cloud works with Packet, a leading MSP, to provision the signer and has a documented chain of custody into Packet’s secure data centers\n* Redundancy\n  * Each Cluster* has redundant infrastructure that is deployed on a different cloud provider/data center and region than your primary Cluster, so you are protected from an outage\n* Double-Signing Protection\n  * This unique process prevents a unique, block-signing entity from introducing an equivocation event — such as double-spending\n* Service Level Agreements (SLAs)\n  * Market leading SLAs including 99% uptime guarantee\n* Security\n  * You manage the authentication options for each node. Service includes bottom-up resiliency with proprietary non-custodial key management, multi-cloud provider, multi-region capabilities, and 3rd party security audits\n* Support\n  * 24/7 support including around the clock monitoring, and proactive updates\n  * Dedicated Coinbase Cloud team for your network: 1x protocol specialist, 1x lead engineer, 1x partnership manager, 1x customer success manager, directly available to you\n* Community Engagement\n  * Continual community, protocol, and industry updates and education from our in-house team of protocol specialists\n* Payment Flexibility\n  * Coinbase Cloud is committed to the growth of the industry and, as such, is able to accept payment in digital assets\n\n# Drawbacks\n\nOpportunity cost for FOX token allocations.\n\n# Vote\n\nFor: Formalizes the community is “for” the details outlined in this proposal including partnership with Coinbase Cloud and Phase 1 & 2 Deliverables and Terms.\n\nAgainst: Formalizes the community is “against” the details outlined in this proposal including partnership with Coinbase Cloud and Phase 1 & 2 Deliverables and Terms.\n",

This is a proposal to add the additional ¾ time headcount to the existing workstream from March 1 the end of April 2022.\n\nMotivation: ShapeShift made great headway in national and international recognition prior to decentralizing; as a DAO, it’s important to remain visible, relevant, and continue this level of global visibility to both DAO enthusiasts and those beginning to embrace crypto. Bringing in a highly experienced PR professional, writer, and former ShapeShift head of communications to assist in our PR efforts, blogging, editing of external communications, and the elevation of DAO participants in thought leadership will help the success of both the platform and the DAO. Lindsaylou demonstrated considerable results during her tenure, growing share of voice against competitors from 15% to 30% (equal to Coinbase during the decentralization launch), and helped earn a 2B gross media audience in just two days following the DAO and airdrop announcements (she wrote press releases as well as contributed articles, blogs, customer service content, reviewed eblasts, and added to social content).\n\nSpecifications: The Growth & Globalization workstream proposes to add Lindsaylou, former ShapeShift head of communications, to the existing Growth & Globalization workstream at a cost of 9,950USD/month for 30 hr/week work through April 30, 2022 (19,900USD total). Included in this proposal is an additional budget of 150 USD/month, or 300USD total, to enlist a media platform for media commentary opportunities for ShapeShift’s DAO experts.\n\n(To further quantify her results during this two-month period, she would need an additional investment for the Meltwater platform to measure pickups, gross media audience, and share of voice growth; we propose that we consider making this expenditure in the April stream proposal, where she will likely be added as a contributor)\n\nHer proposed focuses and deliverables include:\n\n- Ideating and writing press releases for the ShapeShift DAO and for DAO partnerships\n- Working with her extensive media contacts to ensure adequate media coverage of these releases and some noteworthy blogs (as warranted by the importance of the news; not all releases will be covered by media, and some degree of pre-vetting for media embargo is needed)\n- Ideating and working with DAO participants for the creating and submission of blogs and contributed articles for crypto publications, working in harmony with the Marketing Stream\n- Reconnecting with her crypto podcaster connections to get Willyfox, Jonisjon, and other interested participants more visibility on the podcast circuit, and then providing links to the Marketing stream to promote in social channels and DAO communities\n- Creating social media posts about media coverage for the Marketing Stream as helpful\n- Searching for opportunities for DAO participants to offer commentary to industry articles on crypto and DAO trends (requested budget for platform to find commentary opportunities: $150/mo. USD, or $300 total USD through April 30)\n- Working with Cryptomeg and others in the customer service stream to assist in notifications to customers as needed\n- Assisting in editing blogs in the Marketing Stream as desired\nBudget: Part-time Role (added): External Communications Lead: Lindsaylou (30 hours/week) Two-month total cost: $20,200USD ($19,900USD + $300USD media commentary platform)\n\nBenefits: Return ShapeShift’s external communications to the level of maturity we have come to expect; gain more global visibility for our announcements; generate higher-quality content; get our experts on the podcasting circuit for visibility to the DAO and crypto community, providing more content to share within all channels.\n\nDrawbacks: This is a two-month contract, so regaining momentum and seeing published content (editorial lead time) can take more time than that. However, the intent is to extend this relationship in the next proposal renewal.",

      "title": "[SCP - 63] Operate Umee, Juno and Terra Validators on behalf of the ShapeShift DAO",
      "content": "**Summary** - This proposal would accomplish the following: A validator will be run on the new Umee blockchain with the intention of providing a revenue stream for the DAO. This is the third validator proposal from TaxiStake. We are also requesting pre-approval for Juno and Terra validators.\n\n**Abstract** - Umee is decentralized infrastructure for cross chain interactions between networks. Umee connects users to create lending and borrowing positions, move capital across chains, discover new yield opportunities and explore DeFi applications intersecting networks in a seamless and trustless manner. TaxiStake was involved in two incentivized testnets for the Umee network and has been selected as a genesis validator for the Umee mainent. Since the first post, there main-net chain has launched and you can view the Umee validator here: https://www.mintscan.io/umee/validators/umeevaloper1gvt9l5tshr0fp8ksl2tuem584z69eyvt9m8yh6 \n\nThis validator will be run under the TaxiStake name until we pass the ShapeShift governance process, then it will be renamed to ShapeShift DAO.\nYou can find more about Umee on their website: https://umee.cc/\n\n**Specification** - We are proposing that the ShapeShift DAO expands it’s validating footprint with a mainnet validator on the Umee network. Umee has a working Tendermint to Ethereum bridge that will allow the ShapeShift DAO to potentially hold or interact with wrapped ATOM in the Gnosis safe. The Umee platform also will allow users to take loans against these ATOM in the form of stablecoins. The web-app is available to test here: Umee — the Cross Chain DeFi Hub\n\nAs discussed in the first forum post, this proposal also includes pre-approval for Terra and Juno validators. I do not have an ETA for those yet. On completion of these validators, we are requesting 10,000 FOX for each deliverable. https://forum.shapeshift.com/t/scp-63-operate-an-umee-validator-on-behalf-of-the-shapeshift-dao\n\nTaxiStake is working to schedule an AMA with the Umee team for the ShapeShift community.\n\nSetup and maintenance of the validator will be done by TaxiStake under the ShapeShift brand name. Rewards, in the form of UST, will be distributed to the DAO’s Gnosis Safe to diversify the income streams of the DAO. Once the Umee mainnet is launched, it will be assessed if the DAO would prefer to receive wrapped ATOM instead of UST.\n\nSince November 2021, the ShapeShift DAO has received approximately 127,000 UST from validating operations partnering with TaxiStake. https://etherscan.io/token/0xa47c8bf37f92abed4a126bda807a7b7498661acd?a=0x90A48D5CF7343B08dA12E067680B4C6dbfE551Be \n\nWe are proposing that the Umee validator commission be set at 5% and the commission from the ShapeShift validator will be distributed to the DAO treasury and TaxiStake in a 70%(DAO)/30%(TaxiStake) split of minus $2600/month for operating and maintenance expenses. The term is set for a 12 month period starting March 1st, 2022 through February 28th, 2023. TaxiStake is requesting 10,000 FOX for the initial setup and creation of an Umee validator. Umee users who delegate to the ShapeShift Umee validator will be supporting the ShapeShift DAO as well as securing the Umee network. TaxiStake will convert the Umee into UST until Gnosis Safe adds ATOM support or synthetic ATOM on ETH is possible.\n\n**Benefits** - By creating a third validator for the ShapeShift DAO, it will continue to expand revenue generating activities from staking.\n\n**Drawbacks** - There is a request for 10,000 FOX ($3,100 @ $0.31 FOX).\n\n**Ideation post: https://forum.shapeshift.com/t/scp-63-ideation-operate-umee-juno-and-terra-validators-on-behalf-of-the-shapeshift-dao/1201\nForum post: https://forum.shapeshift.com/t/scp-63-operate-an-umee-validator-on-behalf-of-the-shapeshift-dao/1122\n**\n**Vote** - If you vote “ for ” this proposal you are voting to create a ShapeShift DAO Umee validator with the specific details laid out in this proposal. 10,000 FOX will be sent to TaxiStake. TaxiStake will provide regular payments of stablecoins in return for the use of the ShapeShift name on an Umee Validator. This also acts as pre-approval for a Juno and Terra validator, with the same terms.\n\nIf you vote “ against ” you are saying you do not believe this Umee validator should move forward per the details presented in this proposal.",

      "title": "Proposal to Re-elect Diggy as Product & Creative Services Workstream Leader ",
      "content": "Motivation\n\nThis proposal is to be re-elected as Product & Creative Services Workstream leader through the end of June 2022. It’s definitely been a fun and challenging role so far — as there’s been a lot to work through and processes to figure out, but together with all the talented individuals on the Workstream, I feel that we’re off to a really good start. I’d like to continue in the role provided the community agrees. For those who don’t yet know about me, please feel free to take a look at the original proposal (https://forum.shapeshift.com/t/proposal-elect-diggy-as-product-workstream-leader/703)  which outlines my background and my original motivation for applying to the role.\n\nMy main goal is to make sure we execute and uphold the vision of the DAO; build out amazing new features and products that bring in revenue; and do so as quickly and efficiently as possible, without sacrificing the user experience. Over the next few months we have a lot of new features that we’re planning to prepare and launch on the product side. Check out the roadmap here (https://shapeshift.notion.site/68196f67e07943ed8bb1e10ac7d1430d?v=024c941b800e48d580630470d282e3dd). In addition, a huge goal (and something we’ve already been tackling) is to ramp up on the number of bounties to the community, allowing us to increase the pace at which we’re shipping new features. Here is a list of the immediate features that we’re preparing on the product side, many of which are being prepared as bounties (https://shapeshift.notion.site/February-Mar-2022-d83b9b012be649bdbbf1eb06f0d6238b) .\n\nSpecification\n\nTo view the Workstream Leader job description, it is posted here (https://shapeshift.notion.site/shapeshift/Job-Description-Product-Workstream-Leader-0d30263cf4a44d9f987f95ad552827b3)\n\nDrawbacks\n\nOne drawback is that it has definitely been a challenge to juggle the leadership responsibilities with UX responsibilities. However, I’ve been recently making an effort to block out “heads down” time on my calendar where I specifically focus on UX for projects in flight. Also, we are looking to hire a UX developer, to help us out with UX and front end.\n\nAnother drawback could be that I’m not as technical from a development perspective as some of the others on the Workstream. However, I look to them for guidance, expertise and support in that regard and do my best to learn quickly, and not be a blocker.\n\nVote\n\nFor: to re-elect Diggy as Product Workstream Leader through the end of June 2022\nAgainst: to do nothing",

      "title": "[SCP-61] Proposal to fund the Security Workstream through May 31, 2022",
      "content": "## Summary\n\nReconfirm @MrNerdHair as Security Workstream Leader, pay him $16,250/month for the first six months of 2022, and allocate $50,000 to the Security Workstream.\n\n## Abstract\n\n@MrNerdHair has served as the Security Workstream leader since 9/2021, and was paid by ShapeShift US until the end of 2021. He has done a good job so far, and the DAO should continue this mutually beneficial relationship.\n\nAs the responsibilities of the Security Workstream expand, it will need funding to create bounties and compensate additional contributors; $50,000 is allocated for these purposes.\n\n## Motivation\n\nThe DAO's relationship with @MrNerdHair has been productive. Having an in-house, full-time, security-focused resource for software architecture, contract review, and engineering assistance is quite valuable and compensation of $16,250/month is commensurate with the compensation of other workstream leaders.\n\nAs the products of the DAO increase in complexity and become adopted by a wider user base, the Security Workstream's role will also grow. As its responsibilities expand beyond what can be comfortably handled by a single person, so will the need to incentivize contributions from outside contributors -- both from other workstreams and from outside the DAO completely. Since the role of Security is primarily to support the efforts of other workstreams, it's tricky to anticipate funding requirements in advance; therefore, a fixed-funding model is proposed, with each future funding request to include an accounting of previous expenditures and the value they have delivered to the DAO.\n\n## Specification\n\n1) The ShapeShift DAO engages VulTech, LLC (@MrNerdHair's consulting company) to lead its Security Workstream and provide associated services for the six-month period between 1/1/2022 and 5/31/2022. VulTech, LLC will be compensated $97,500 in total, payable at a rate of $16,250 per month via the DAO's usual contributor payment scheduling and distribution mechanisms.\n\n2) The DAO's Security Workstream will be allocated $50,000 as operating capital.\n  - The Workstream Leader will coordinate with TMDC to draw these funds into Colony as needed.\n  - These funds may be used to create bounties, compensate workstream contributors, and fulfill any of the Security Workstream's obligations not explicitly funded via other mechanisms.\n  - These funds may be used for on-chain testing or to reimburse gas fees.\n  - While reimbursements for specific expenses incurred on behalf of the DAO are allowed, VulTech, LLC and its employees (i.e., @MrNerdHair) may not receive bounties or additional compensation out of these funds.\n\n3) By the end of the term, the Security Workstream will achieve the following goals:\n  - Continue to administer the Responsible Disclosure Program\n  - Be available to discuss Security best practices and provide architectural support for all DAO initiatives\n  - Provide security review for DAO products and partner integrations\n  - Implement a system for tracking security work and providing visibility into velocity and resource allocation\n    - Track Security Initiatives (stuff that Security does on its own to accomplish its own objectives)\n    - Track Workstream Support efforts (stuff that helps other workstreams accomplish their objectives) and enable other workstreams to reserve security resources for their needs\n    - Stretch goal: use \"story points\" to develop KPIs around overall velocity\n\n## Benefits\n\n- @MrNerdHair continues to provide a best-in-class security resource for the DAO\n- Security begins growing its contributor base to support the DAO's increasing throughput\n- Security remains flexible and focused on supporting the needs of other workstreams as they are discovered\n\n## Drawbacks\n\n- Flexibility to respond to other workstreams' needs as they are discovered requires an essentially pre-paid workstream funding model, which in turn requires trust that funds will be spent wisely\n- Without historical velocity data, non-qualitative KPIs can't meaningfully be set this term\n\n## Voting\n\n- For: Pay @MrNerdHair $16,250/month for the first six months of 2022, and allocate $50,000 to the Security Workstream.\n- Against: Do nothing.",

      "content": "## **Summary**: \nThe ShapeShift governance process is the act of proposing, discussing, and deciding initiatives for the ShapeShift DAO. This proposal is to update our current governance process for clarity and standardization. Changes include formalizing the first step, clarifying additional steps in the process, including proposal execution and resolving issues due to length of proposal.\n\n## **Abstract**: \nWhile important, this proposal does not seek drastic change to the current governance proposal. If this proposal is implemented, the first step will now be required and named Incubation (instead of the current recommended Forum step). Timelines will be formalized as well as the requirements for each step. \n\n## **Motivation**: \nAs the DAO has grown and gained experience, opportunities to improve the original governance process arose. The original recommended first step was optional to allow more flexibility in the conversation as well as move governance forward quickly. The community has spoken and would like more time with the proposal. This proposal requires a post to remain in Incubation for at least three days. There have also been a few housekeeping items (when to assign a SCP number, how many days to leave posts up) that are being clarified. The motivation for this proposal is to help alleviate these issues and allow us to focus our time on the content of proposals, instead of the logistics. \n\n## **Specification**: \n\n# Proposed governance process tl;dr:\n**1. Incubation** - 3 day minimum: Post your idea in the relevant [Workstream](https://forum.shapeshift.com/c/workstream-discussion/6) on the forum to obtain feedback from the community. No specific template is needed. \n**2. Ideation** - 5 day minimum, 60 day maximum: Once incubation post has been live in the forum for 3 days to received feedback, post a draft proposal in [Proposal Discussion](https://forum.shapeshift.com/c/proposal-discussion/7). Proposals must follow this [template](https://forum.shapeshift.com/t/shapeshift-proposal-template/54) and include a yes or no poll. Proposals may continue to be refined based on community feedback during this stage.\n**3. Voting** - 3 day minimum: After at least 5 days in Ideation, if a draft proposal has more upvotes than downvotes, it can be posted to [Boardroom](https://app.boardroom.info/shapeshift/proposals/create) for official vote.\n\n\n# Detailed process:\n**1. Incubation:**\n   - Post in forum.shapeshift.com\n   - Posted under appropriate category (listed at the bottom of this proposal)\n   - No specific format required\n   - Intent is to engage the community\n   - Timeline: 3 days/72 hours\n   - No other requirement to move to Ideation\n\n**2. Ideation:**\n   - Posted in Boardroom ideation (Note: this will take place on the forum until Ideation functionality on Boardroom has returned)\n   - Posted under “Proposal discussion” category\n   - ShapeShift Community Proposal (SCP) [format](https://forum.shapeshift.com/t/shapeshift-proposal-template/54) or Workstream Proposal [format](https://forum.shapeshift.com/t/how-to-propose-a-new-workstream/24) must be used\n   - SCP number is included in title (SCP # should be 1 greater than the most recent SCP posted in [Proposal Discussion](https://forum.shapeshift.com/c/proposal-discussion/7)\n   - Voting power is calculated using the strategies defined on [SnapShot](https://snapshot.org/#/shapeshiftdao.eth/about), explained [here](https://forum.shapeshift.com/t/fox-voting-power/1026) (while ideation is still in the forum, each Forum user has one vote)\n   - Include link to the Incubation post\n   - Must include [poll](https://meta.discourse.org/t/how-to-create-polls/77548) - with three options:\n      - For/Yes with no amendments/changes\n      - For/Yes with amendments/changes\n      - Against/No\n   - Timeline: 5 days minimum, 60 days maximum\n   - Proposal may move forward if the majority votes in favor after timeline specified above\n\n**3. Voting:**\n   - Post to SnapShot following instructions found here.\n   - Address must hold 100 FOX to create a proposal.\n   - Voting is available on both [Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/shapeshiftdao.eth/) and [Boardroom](https://app.boardroom.info/shapeshift/proposals) (Boardroom is another interface to Snapshot.\n   - Voting power is calculated using the strategies defined on [SnapShot](https://snapshot.org/#/shapeshiftdao.eth/about), explained [here](https://forum.shapeshift.com/t/fox-voting-power/1026) (while ideation is still in the forum, any Forum user can vote)\n   - SCP # is included in the title\n   - ShapeShift Community Proposal (SCP) [format](https://forum.shapeshift.com/t/shapeshift-proposal-template/54) or Workstream Proposal [format](https://forum.shapeshift.com/t/how-to-propose-a-new-workstream/24) must be used\n   - Include links to the Incubation and Ideation posts\n   - For proposals over 6400 characters (the current SnapShot limit), use [https://foxpin.xyz/](https://foxpin.xyz/). Include link to IPFS pin in the Live Voting.\n   - Timeline: 72 hour minimum\n    \n# **Ratifying proposals**\nVoting is powered by [Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/shapeshiftdao.eth) and accessible on [Boardroom](https://app.boardroom.info/shapeshift/proposals). SnapShot and Boardroom enable foxes to vote on proposals by signing messages (free) rather than sending transactions (costly).\n\nShapeShift DAO currently practices Liquid Democracy, which means voting power is based on FOX held in wallets (or certain liquidity pools) as well as FOX delegated to the address used to vote. [1 FOX = 1 vote](https://forum.shapeshift.com/t/fox-voting-power/1026).\n\n*Quorum:* A minimum of 4,000,000 FOX must participate in the vote for it to be considered ratified.\n\n*Soft Quorum:* For votes that do not reach Quorum, assume that 70% of the votes necessary to achieve quorum would be against the proposal. If this would still result in a majority of votes being in favor of the proposal, the proposal can be considered passed. See [Soft Quorum Calculator](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14KISmLmFWmjccWSmnMf8m5IbG0kI3CDNMWuA_DhKh20/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n# **Other items of note**\n- Any proposals not following governance process will be removed.\n- All meaningful governance discussion should take place on this forum to ensure the community has full transparency.\n- As FOX continues to expand across DeFi and across chains, the SnapShot voting strategy will be updated to grant 1 vote for 1 FOX wherever feasible.\n- Remember, this is a living document. If there’s anything you want to add or anything that’s unclear, please suggest it below or make an addendum proposal!\n\n# **Conflicting Votes**\nFrom time to time there may be conflicting proposals. To avoid issues, the Ideation phase can also serve as time for anyone to list their preferred alternative option on the forum. Each proposal on an associate topic will have a [TOPIC] block placed in its title.\n\nAfter that time, a formal proposal will be put forward including all options available to move forward with that received majority support in Ideation. This will ensure that everyone has the ability to surface their preferences while keeping decision timelines reasonably short.\n\n# **Proposal Execution**\n\nIf your proposal requires transaction(s) to be executed from the [DAO’s treasury](https://etherscan.io/address/0x90a48d5cf7343b08da12e067680b4c6dbfe551be), there are currently two options available:\n\n**Manual Multisig Execution** *(fast and free)*:To have your transactions executed by the DAO’s multisig, post a message in the #dao-treasury channel in Discord with the following details:\n\n1. Desired date of execution\n2. Type of transaction to be executed (transfer or contract interaction)\n3. If transfer: amount, asset, recipient (ie. 1000, FOX, vitalik.eth)\n4. If contract interaction: contract to interact with, call, and inputs (ie. eth:0xE2aE37B8077CD3BC7ef1C6580f6dc93673078A01 (Olympus Bond Treasury), withdraw, _token(address): eth:0xA0b86991c6218b36c1d19D4a2e9Eb0cE3606eB48, _destination(address): eth:0x90A48D5CF7343B08dA12E067680B4C6dbfE551Be, _amount(uint256): 830168207423)\n\nIf you need help figuring out the details of the transaction(s) necessary to execute in order to enact your proposal, feel free to post a question in the DAO Treasury channel.\n\n**Automatic SafeSnap Execution** *(slower and costs more gas)*:To have your transaction executed via SafeSnap, you must first include the details of the transaction(s) when creating the proposal on SnapShot. Then, once your proposal has passed with Quorum (soft quorum will not qualify for automatic execution and must be executed manually), you will see a button on SnapShot to trigger a question on Reality.eth, the smart contract oracle that uses game theory and bonded FOX to bring the results of off-chain SnapShot votes on chain. The resulting Reality.eth question asks if (1) the linked Snapshot proposal passed, (2) did the proposal include the payload, and (3) does the payload do what the proposal describes. If a question on Reality.eth is successfully resolved, the [Reality.eth Safe Module](https://etherscan.io/address/0xAf2D760E28Cff61447135714e6b90fA3079396e5#code) installed on the [DAO’s Treasury](https://gnosis-safe.io/app/eth:0x90A48D5CF7343B08dA12E067680B4C6dbfE551Be/) enables the transactions included in the proposal to be executed via SnapShot’s UI, bypassing the DAO’s multisig.\n[More information on SafeSnap](https://blog.gnosis.pm/introducing-safesnap-the-first-in-a-decentralized-governance-tool-suite-for-the-gnosis-safe-ea67eb95c34f)\n\n# **Benefits**: \nMore efficiency and clarify to the governance process. \n\n# **Drawbacks**: \nThe documentation (pinned messages, forum posts, etc) will need to be updated with the new process. Education regarding the new process will need to be pushed for easy adoption.  \n\n---\n\n# **Proposal categories to choose from for the Incubation step:**  \n\n**Progressive Decentralization:** Transitioning responsibilities and ownership of all ShapeShift operations to the DAO.\n**Partnerships:** Developing mutually-beneficial partnerships and affiliate revenue opportunities with aligned DAOs and products.\n**Product (Features and Product):** Planning the optimal feature roadmap for achieving ShapeShift’s vision as the open-source interface to the decentralized universe.\n**Engineering:** Planning and executing the open-sourcing of all ShapeShift code and infrastructure. Developing new features, fixing bugs, and optimizing performance of ShapeShift’s web and mobile applications.\n**FOX Tokenomics:** Evolving and enhancing FOX token utility and value accrual.\n**Marketing & Growth:** Executing campaigns focused on growing the ShapeShift ecosystem.\n**Moderation:** Supporting the community and maintaining the integrity of all ShapeShift various platforms such as Discord, The Forum, Boardroom and Notion.\n**Operations:** Managing and optimizing ShapeShift’s operational processes.\n**Special Projects:** Propose new workstreams to be added.\n**Customer Support:** Delighting and educating customers as they navigate and experience The ShapeShift DAO.\n**Information & Globalization:** Strategizing, implementation, and optimization of growth campaigns/initiatives for the ShapeShift DAO.",

      "title": "[SCP-65] Deployment of FOXy and delegation of administration to the TMDC",
      "content": "#### Summary:\n\nFOXy is a proposed staking rewards system that allows FOX token holders the ability to stake FOX into a smart contract in order to receive rewards denominated in FOXy. FOXy is an ERC20, rebasing token that is redeemable 1:1 with FOX tokens. The FOX rewards generated by the staking system are provided to the contract via the Shapeshift DAO’s treasury swapping for Tokemak’s TOKE rewards, but this project aims to provide a design that is extensible in the future for other alternative yield generating strategies. The ultimate goal is for FOX holders to have a simplified interface in which to earn yield on their FOX tokens that outperforms other avenues available to them without active management. Several mechanisms of the system have implications for the DAO’s treasury and require approval by the formal DAO governance process to proceed. \n\n\nThis proposal seeks governance approval for the following:\n\n1) deployment of the the smart contract system on behalf of the DAO and the transfer of ownership of these contracts to the DAO multisig.\n2) empowerment of the Treasury Management and Diversification Committee (TMDC) to adminster the following responsiblities on behalf of the DAO:\n  a) management of the TOKE to FOX swaps required to reward staking participants\n  b) FOX contributions to the FOXy liquidity reserve to enable immediate liquidity (for a penalty) for users.\n  c) setting and adjusting the percentage fee for user's accessing immediate liquidity\n\n\n#### Project Timeline\n\nCurrently, Toshi is leading the project to deliver the FOXy staking program to mainnet with a target date of early Q2 2022. The project is being funded solely by personal funds that have been committed to a bounty created by Beorn ([link ](https://forum.shapeshift.com/t/bounty-120-000-300-000-fox-for-foxy-aka-sfox-by-mar-22nd/984)).\n\n\n#### Specification\n\nIf approved the following steps will be taken:\n\n1. A bounty hunter will deploy the audited FOXy smart contract suite to Ethereum mainnet. Publishing the source code to etherscan\n2. Ownership of the contract will be transferred to the DAO multisig address\n3. The security and engineering workstreams will validate that the code that is deployed matches the audited code.\n4. The TMDC will decide on the desired fee percentage and the DAO multisig will set this fee.\n5. The TMDC will decide on the amount of initial FOX liquidity to add to the reserve and will transfer the needed FOX to the contracts.\n6. Initial users can then proceed to deposit FOX\n7. After the initial Tokemak cycle has passed, the TMDC can facilitate the first redemption of TOKE and infusion of FOX to trigger the first rebase for active stakers.\n8. The TMDC will perpetually facilitate this swap at the end of each Tokemak cycle.\n9. The TMDC will continue to monitor balances, the frequency of immediate withdrawals incurring a fee and make adjustments to both the amount of FOX in the reserve and the fee percent.\n\n\n#### Benefits\n\n* Allows for the creation of an important mechanism for FOX holders to receive yield on their FOX and paves the way for future possibilities for the DAO to distribute additional FOX from other revenue sources to token holders\n* Allows for users to access immediate liquidity if required\n* Enables the potential for FOXy to be used as collateral on other DeFi ecosystems since liquidators are able to immediately exit if need be.\n* Opportunity costs for the DAO is very low given we have an excess of FOX and this pool can generate a return on that FOX.\n* Allows for a trusted committee to be put in charge of the TOKE rewards generated by the system and enables the DAO to be nimble with market conditions on whether to sell or retain the TOKE in the DAO’s treasury.\n\n#### Drawbacks\n\n* Any smart contract suite comes with security and operational risks that the DAO would be taking on. Formal audits will be in place prior to the launch and the community will be able to review all source code.\n* Exposes N Million DAO owned FOX to the same smart contract risks mentioned above.\n* Creates a non market based rate for the liquidation penalty due to the unique nature of the DAO’s FOX position. This will probably mean the penalty for immediate FOXy exit is lower than other market participants would accept in return for their FOX deposits.\n* Puts additional trust and responsibility on the TMDC committee that they (of course) would need to be willing to accept.\n\n\n#### Vote\n\nFor - If you vote for this proposal, the DAO will proceed with the deployment of the FOXy smart contract suite and the delegation of its administration to the TMDC as outlined in the specification section above.\n\nAgainst - No action will be taken. \n",

      "title": "[SCP-66] We FOX'ed Up Campaign - Customer Support",
      "content": "1. **We FOX'ed Up fund** \n\n2. **Summary** - The Customer Support team would like 10,000 FOX allocated (2k per leader of support) to the workstream to use as a retention tool, starting March 1st. The 10,000 FOX will be sent to Workstream Leader, @cryptohmeg, to use until funds need replenished or we sunset the campaign. \n\nWhen agents report a user has had a bad experience, the support leaders can use their discretion on sending the customer some FOX to ensure we retain the user. (The avg in the past has been 50-100 FOX)\n\nAdditionally we'll need ETH to fund the gas for this particular campaign. This campaign could very well continue into the next proposal, but considering this is small amount. I'd like to request 0.50 ETH or the equivalent in USDC (from the DAO treasury). Any unused funds will roll over into the next period. More than likely, we can use a shared vault/shared wallet for this purpose (which I know can seem like a security issue, but for this amount of money I believe the convenience and amount outweigh the security fears).\n \n3. **Abstract** - We'd like to add some lightness to the campaign by calling it \"We FOX'ed Up\" and use that language when talking to customers. It's widely known that sometimes, things just go wrong. While we explore all of the corners of the ShapeShift DAO possibilities, surely things will go awry. When they do, we can use this campaign to let users know we are sorry for the mishap and try and compensate them for the bad experience.\n\nPending the success of this ongoing campaign, we'll request more or less funds in the future. \n\n4. **Motivation** - We want to make sure we have additional tools in our back pocket as a support team to retain customers, keep them happy, and delight the crap out of them. Giving my leadership team a way to take control over bad situations (and sometimes good situations) helps everyone. \n\n5. **Specification** -\n\n* 10,000 FOX + 0.5 ETH or the equivaleent in USDC \n* To be used at the discretion of the support leaders \n* We will provide a public, view only doc of all of the FOX sends the campaign sends out and a section to follow up with the customer later (or come up with another way to best measure \"retention\" of the user). Not all FOX sends will be angry customers necessarily and some might be stellar customers that we want to reward. We'll be sure to note this in the public doc.\n\n\n6. **Benefits** - \n\n* Empower Support Leaders\n* Retain users\n* Creates a decentralized way to disperse \"We FOX'ed Up\" funds to users.\n* Gets more FOX into active users' hands\n* Inexpensive (relatively)\n\n7. **Drawbacks** - \n\n* The amount we are asking for is arbitrary and may not help as much as we think, thus needing to request more sooner than we think.\n\n8. **Vote** - \n\nYES: I vote for 10000 FOX + 0.5 ETH or the USDC equivalent to be allocated to the Customer Support Workstream on March 1st\n\nNO: I do not want 10000 FOX  + 0.5 ETH or the USDC equivalent allocated to the Customer Support Workstream.\n\n",

      "content": "# Abstract / Overview\n\nThe ShapeShift DAO relies on the Engineering Workstream to maintain the open source code base, undertake core engineering work to enable new features, support bounties from the broader community, and to provide architectural oversight and technical leadership as we continue to execute the DAO's vision.\n\nThis proposal is to fund the Engineering Workstream’s budget from March 1st, 2022 through August 31st, 2022 inclusive.\n\nThis proposal also seeks to appoint 0xdef1cafe as the Engineering Workstream leader, taking over from Josh Forman.\n\n# Motivation\n\n## Leadership\n\nJosh Forman is stepping down as Engineering Workstream leader at the end of the current budget cycle to pursue his personal passion of leadership and coaching full time. Josh has been instrumental in his leadership of engineering within ShapeShift for many years, previously as Director of Engineering at centralized ShapeShift, helping the team navigate through progressive decentralization as ShapeShift transitioned from a centralized entity to a DAO. On behalf of the team and community, we thank Josh for his inspiration and leadership over his tenure, and wish him the very best success with his own endeavours. Josh will remain a part of the Engineering Workstream in a part time capacity, providing leadership coaching, guidance, and facilitating retrospectives and workshops.\n\n0xdef1cafe (that's me!) has been with ShapeShift since January 2021, previously as a Senior Software Engineer and Engineering Manager. You can see my technical contributions to the [web](https://github.com/shapeshift/web/graphs/contributors) and [lib](https://github.com/shapeshift/lib/graphs/contributors) repositories respectively.\n\nOutside my direct technical contributions, I\n* represent ShapeShift at conferences including EthCC and MCON Denver in 2021, and ETHDenver 2022;\n* represent engineering in discussions and partnerships with Bancor, Yearn, IOTA, XDEFI and others;\n* say gm and run standup daily;\n* collaborate closely with all other workstream leaders, and the ShapeShift Foundation;\n* define, plan, and oversee execution of our technical roadmap;\n* do whatever it takes to execute the DAO's shared vision.\n\n## Financial\n\n### Budget spreadsheet\n\nThe details below expand upon the [budget spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18qtCKhBHlZg91bRH054nmabHMaClQO-WdmkM22p9600).\n\n### Current team & growth\n\nPlease see the budget spreadsheet for an authoritative list, but in summary, the current team includes eleven current contributors; nine former ShapeShift employees, plus welcomes two new full time contributors, 0xApotheosis and gomes, both starting in February 2022.\n\nThe budget also includes five open positions to further expand the workstream and it's ability to deliver.\n\n* Two mid level engineers\n* Two senior level engineers\n* One technical program manager\n\nThe Technical Program Manager role is new, and is intended to include, but not be limited to, project management, administration of bounties, coordination with other workstreams, managing releases, and fostering partnerships. This role will relieve pressure from engineers administering these tasks, allowing them to focus on individual contribution work.\n\nAccordingly, this budget seeks approval for the commitment of $1,909,050, plus an allocation of FOX as explained below. This will cover direct labor costs, to cover fifteen total current and open positions, and funds for a health community developer ecosystem.\n\n### FOX streams\n\nThe labor market for engineering talent is becoming increasingly competetive. It is essential that the ShapeShift DAO is able to both attract and retain top engineering talent, in order to remain competitive in the rapidly-evolving crypto landscape. Organizations offering at or above market rate compensation are more easily able to attract said talent.\n\nThe proposed budget seeks to achieve this goal by\n\n1. Increasing engineering salaries by 20% over the previous budget cycle, in alignment with current US market rates for mid and senior level engineers, and\n2. Incentivizes the attraction and retention of talent to the Engineering Workstream by an additional stream of FOX tokens, to create an assymmetric upside opportunity for committed contributors.\n\nThe FOX stream is inspired by traditional compensation models used by private or public companies with options or restricted stock units respectively. This is typically a 4 year total period including a 1 year cliff, with the potential upside equal to the base salary at the outset annually.\n\nA FOX stream will work as follows:\n\n1. The strike price for FOX will be determined as the 6 month average FOX Price to March 1, 2022, or the date which a contributor joins the Engineering Workstream after March 1 2022, whichever is latest.\n2. Total FOX compensation equal to 3 years base salary, excluding overhead compensation, at said strike price, over a 36 month (3 year) period, not adjusted with future negotiations.\n3. Each contributors FOX stream is subject to a 6 month cliff after their start date, no earlier than March 1 2022. A 6 month lump sum will unlock at this date.\n4. After the 6 month cliff period, the remaining amount will be made available via a streaming smart contract over 30 months.\n5. If a contributor leaves, or fails to adequately contribute to the Engineering Workstream at any point during the 36 month period, the contributor's stream will be cancelled, with any remaining funds to be returned to the DAO.\n6. The exact streaming tool is to be determined, but may include Sablier or Superfluid for capital efficiency.\n7. Tax implications are the responsibilities of individual contributors.\n8. The stream is specific to the Engineering Workstream, and is non-transferable between ShapeShift DAO workstreams, unless approved by a governance vote.\n\nThe budget seeks approval for a provisional total amount of 18,834,341 FOX to committed - a minimum of 12,921,403 FOX for current workstream members, and 5,912,938 FOX for open positions. This total amount is contingent on all current workstream members, plus all provisional open positions being filled. In the event that open positions are not filled, some of the addtional 5,912,938 FOX may not be required.\n\nIt must be noted that this proposal seeks the *commitment*, but not the *spend of*, 18,834,341 FOX for this budget. From a cash flow perspective, approximately one sixth (6 out of 36 months) will be required to cover lump sump payments for members contributing full time to the end of this budget, plus any additional amount required to be committed to contributor's streams thereafter.\n\nAdditionally, it must be noted that the FOX amounts outlined above are provisional, and calculated based on a 6 month average FOX price to February 1st 2022. Actual amounts will be finalized based on the 6 month average FOX price prior to the beginning of the budget - i.e. March 1st 2022.\n\nThe workstream will ensure the tool chosen in point 6 for streams meets our requirements in points 5 and 8 above, while maximizing capital efficiency for the DAO, such that the minimum amount of FOX is locked in contracts.\n\n### Bounties\n\nIn the previous budget cycle, the Engineering Workstream delivered a completely new version of ShapeShift. Open source and written from the ground up, it is architected for extensibility, ease of integration, and maintenance, among other goals.\n\nGiven the open source nature of the new version, the Engineering Workstream has been able to create bounties via Gitcoin to outsource the completion of well defined work. These bounties have proved to be an extremely effective and efficient way to\n\n* attract new ad-hoc and full time contributors to the code base,\n* complete tasks with varying scope and complexity, from single line changes to research spikes, and\n* allow the Engineering Workstream to focus on delivering core engineering work.\n\nEngineering-sponsored bounties will continue to be an integral part of our strategy to deliver bug fixes, maintenance, new features, and attract new contributors, and the number of bounties will to continue to increase.\n\nAccordingly, this budget seeks $175,000 over six months, equivalent to two full time senior engineer positions annualized, to be managed at the workstreams discretion to continue to operate and expand the bounty program.\n\n### Non-labor costs\n\nThe budget also contains two line items for\n\n* Four contract audits at a cost of $50,000 each, and\n* Six month of team building and entertainment expenses, at $5,000/month.\n\nBoth of these line items are provisional, and any unspent funds will be returned to the DAO.\n\nThis budget seeks approval for the commitment of $260,000 for non-labor costs.\n\n### Contingency\n\nUnforeseen costs will arise, and 10% of the subtotal is requested accordingly.\n\nThe budget seeks approval for $347,100 for contingency to be spent judiciously at the workstreams discretion, shall it be required.\n\n### Variance\n\nUnused funds from any budget category will be returned to the DAO at the end of the  budget cycle. In the unlikely event that the Engineering Workstream requires more funds, a separate governance proposal shall be raised.\n\n# Deliverables\n\n## Goals\n\nThe Engineering Workstream was initially formed on September 1 2021 via [this snapshot vote](https://app.boardroom.info/shapeshift/proposal/cHJvcG9zYWw6c2hhcGVzaGlmdDpkZWZhdWx0OnFtZTV2dmIyeHJuc2VjbzVocG92YXgyaGhiNnhmNzVrcG0yMmVkdXhkcWFodXM=). The Engineering Workstream has since matured, and will continue to operate in accordance with the original proposal.\n\nThe budget spreadsheet contains a list of goals and deliverables the workstream intends to complete during this budget. Detailed breakdowns of each item are available upon request.\n\nThe DAO recognizes that the crypto ecosystem is rapidly evolving and liable to change quickly. The Engineering Workstream reserves the right to add, remove, or reprioritize goals from this list, with the intent to deliver the most valuable and relevant items expediently to the market.\n\nThe product roadmap, externally posted bounties, emerging partnerships, and changes in resourcing are all factors liable to change the scope or prioritization of listed goals, however, broadly speaking, we intend to complete the strategic goals that are currently defined.\n\nAdditionally, the Engineering Workstream anticipates the listed goals to be non exhaustive, and is confident that the scope of work completed within six months to be greater than what is explicitly defined. The DAO must acknowledge that a rigidly planned six month roadmap within the crypto ecosystem would be naive at best, and that the Engineering Workstream, in conjunction with the DAO as a whole, should remain agile in responding to and capitalizing upon market opportunities as they arise.\n\n## Reporting\n\nThe Engineering Workstream will report progress against these goals via the following methods\n\n* daily public standups\n* availability during normal working hours in Discord\n* weekly engineering/product public meetings\n* weekly governance calls\n* weekly marketing newsletters\n* fortnightly engineering demos\n* monthly forum posts\n* periodic engineering office hours\n\n## Benefits\n\nFundamentally, the DAO delivers a product to increase ease of use of the multi-chain multi-wallet multi-protocol universe that we find ourselves in. It is the Engineering effort that builds our product. We need Engineering in order to thrive. The goals listed above will be delivered.\n\n## Drawbacks\n\nEngineering labor is the most expensive component of the DAO's budget. Any aspect that does not seem appropriate to serve the greater needs of the DAO should be criticized.\n\n# Disclosure\n\nThe author of this proposal, 0xdef1cafe, stands to benefit from it, and is long FOX.\n\n# Vote\n\nFOR: Fund the Engineering Workstream from March 1 2022 to August 31st 2022 for $1,909,050 and 18,834,341 FOX, and appoint 0xdef1cafe as the workstream leader.\n\nAGAINST: Do not fund the Engineering Workstream beyond March 1 2022.\n",

      "title": "[SCP-62] Should the Treasury Management and Diversification Committee continue past 16 February 2022",
      "content": "Summary:\n\nThe Treasury Management and Diversification Committee (TMDC) was established on a trial basis by [SCP-36]. The trial period will end on 16 February 2022 and without a new proposal the TMDC will dissolve.\n\nBased on the successful performance of the TMDC during the trial period this proposal is for the DAO to authorize the continuance of the TMDC from 17 February 2022 on an indefinite basis with the proposed amendments to its mandate below which are based on the lessons observed during the trial period.\n\nAbstract:\n\nIf the proposal is passed, the TMDC will continue to manage the treasury for the long term benefit of the DAO to seize opportunities and mitigate risks by using measured decision processes. TMDC committee members will be compensated and the committee member slate will adopt a six month renewal cycle. The TDMC will strive to finish the term with $4M in new stablecoins.\n\nMotivation:\n\nThe original impetus to form the TMDC was that we did not want to have every tokenomics decision have to go through full governance because of the delay of time from ideation to execution limited the DAO’s ability to respond to opportunities and risks to the treasury. Specifically, to seize opportunities to diversify and accrue stable coins in our treasury. Concurrently, the TDMC was also directed to provide a layer of due diligence and to take measured decisions.\n\nWithout a continuance, the TMDC will dissolve at the end of the trial period on Feb 16, 2022. After that date, the DAO will revert to its previous risk profile without a time-agile response capability to accrue stable coins and it could take too long to take advantage of opportunities to diversify our treasury.\n\nSpecifications:\n\nThe specifications of the continued committee will be the same as [SCP-36] with the following amendments:\n\nAmendment #1: Members of the committee (with the exception of Kent, who is already compensated as the Tokenomics Workstream leader) will be compensated in FOX at a rate of 4000 FOX per month.\n\nDuring the trial period, committee members were not compensated. This was because the level of effort was unknown and the value of the committee was unproven. The TMDC met not less than 16 times, studied, deliberated and made asset assignments 15 times. The level of effort and responsibility is substantial. As explained in the State of the Treasury section below the Fox Treasury position is now streaming approximately $44,000 USDC per day into the treasury as a benefit from the TMDC work.\n\nTMDC should be compensated in FOX to incentivize committee members to be long Fox; and a study of fair compensation suggests a range of 3000-4000 FOX per month as reasonable for the level of effort and responsibility. Given the positive performance of the TMDC the value should be at the upper range.\n\nAmendment #2: TMDC will track its activities and provide the DAO with a monthly status of activities within 7 days of the last day of the month each month. Compensation will be conditional upon the production of the monthly summary.\n\nAmendment #3: Pending governance approval and deployment of the FOXy token/contract, the TMDC will be tasked with managing token swaps and other relevant mechanics in order to generate rewards (which will in turn be distributed to FOXy holders). \n\nAmendment #4: The TDMC will strive to finish the term with $4M in new stablecoins.\n\nGovernance of the Committee:\n\nThe governance of the continued committee will be the same as [SCP-36] with the following amendments:\n\nAmendment #5: The slate of committee membership will be approved by the DAO on a six month cycle from the approval date.\n\nAmendment #6: The proposed slate of members for the continued committee for the first six month cycle are:\n\nAmicus.eth / Rotorless | Joshf | profMcC | seven7hwave/ Kent | JonisJon\n\nState of the Treasury:\n\nTl;dr - the FOX treasury is receiving yield from TMDC work.\n\nThe most significant achievement during the trial period is incoming stablecoin streams to the ShapeShift treasury achieving the mandate of the TMDC.\n\nFor example:\n\nThe link below shows a value of $830,000 USDC in accumulated yields from TMDC assignments to the initial FOX/USDC Bond that was transferred into the ShapeShift treasury on 7 Feb .\n\nhttps://etherscan.io/token/0xa0b86991c6218b36c1d19d4a2e9eb0ce3606eb48?a=0x90a48d5cf7343b08da12e067680b4c6dbfe551be\n\nThe current streaming revenue is Approximately $40,000 USDC. Additionally, the TMDC has increased the assignment to the FOX/USDC fund to yield an estimated $100,000 USDC per day for the next 3 months.\n\nMost, but not all (limitations of aggregation) of the treasury positions can be viewed on this zapper link here:\n\nhttps://zapper.fi/account/0x90a48d5cf7343b08da12e067680b4c6dbfe551be?tab=dashboard\n\nThe Fox and Frens Rari pool can be viewed here: https://app.rari.capital/fuse/pool/79/info\n\nThe Fox Tokemak reactor can be viewed here: https://www.tokemak.xyz/\n\nThe Olympus Fox/USDC bond offer can be viewed here: Olympus Pro - Bond marketplace for protocol owned liquidity 1\n\nIf you are into it you can track these other activities on etherscan (see my comment above on producing a monthly summary):\n\nDeposit $5M FEI Deposit $50,000 Silo Finance Deposit $3M In Tokemak Deposit $ 1M FOX/USDC BOND for 1 month at payout of $40,000 FOX Deposit $1.7M FOX to increase collateral in Rari Fox & Frens Borrowed $1M in FEI, swapped for $1M USDC Sold $150,000 of Toke for $150,000 USDC Deposit $3.5M Fox into Angel Vault Deposit $1M FOX/USDC BOND Increase monthly payout to $100,000 FOX Delegated authority to manage FOX/USDC Bond to the Bond Committee. Added FOX/ETH LP to the the FOX & Frens Rari Pool Extended the FOX/USDC $2M Bond at $100,000 FOX payout for 3 months Deposit 39,920 USDC to Pendo Re-collateralize $900K worth of FOX and 450K USDC in Angel Vault.\n\nRequirements:\n\nThe TMDC priority will continue to take a holistic approach to DAO treasury management, and act toward the long-term success of FOX token and the ShapeShift DAO. The committee will remain a dedicated team of FOX members carefully watching, acting and working with each other on a weekly basis.\n\nAt the time of writing there was 198M FOX in the Sablier wallet and 237M FOX in the Shapeshift treasury wallet. The initial allocation to the TMDC was 60M FOX. Approximately 15.5M FOX remains. No increase in control over additional funds is proposed for the next cycle.\n\nThe committee will administer the pools the community owns. If the committee should want to sell FOX: The committee’s actions should have limited price impact on the FOX token, no one tactic can drop the price by more than 2%.\n\nRoadmap:\n\nTMDC continues to develop tools and processes for treasury management with a view towards continuity of knowledge to enable succession of committee members.\n\nBenefits:\n\nTo continue to be capable to act quickly, manage and execute on treasury management and diversification strategies to allow for a more active, holistic and long-term approach to treasury management. To leverage the lessons of the trial TMDC period going forward.\n\nEvery FOX holder can vote to add or remove committee members and can bring treasury management suggestions and comment on proposals before the committee.\n\nDrawbacks:\n\nNot every FOX holder can vote on the committee.\n\n",

      "title": "[SCP-59] - Proposal to fund the Operations Workstream for a second term",
      "content": "Summary\nThis proposal is for a continuation of budget funding for a 6 month second term (February 1-July 31st, 2022) to the current Operations workstream that was established with the passing of [SCP-8]\n\nAbstract\nThe Operations workstream is an integral part of the growth and development of healthy systems for reliably producing and maintaining the ShapeShift product suite and its uptime, responsiveness and feature functionality. The workstream additionally provides similar support and structure to the DAO and its ecosystem and networks.\n\nThrough Production Issue Procedure Best Practices, Triage Management, Deployment and Regression Testing, and DAO Admin Procedures and Practices, the ShapeShift DAO Operations Workstream provides essential resources and tools for efficiency, organization, and overall product and services health that are vital to the success of the DAO, the product suite, it’s contributors, and $FOX token utility.\n\nMotivation\nThe Operations workstream works side by side with other workstreams to increase efficiency and help progress deployment and testing processes while still verifying and maintaining reliability, health, and full functionality of all provided services.\n\nThis allows the Engineering workstream to spend more time building and deploying, the Product workstream to spend more time scoping, designing, and implementing, the C-Mods more C-Mod time, etc… Funding this workstream empowers Operations to continue to scale the team, complete the above stated goals through the developed procedures and processes, and organize and provide updates, resources, communication, coordination, documentation and any other need that may arise from other workstreams, the DAO Community, and its processes.\n\nThe Operations workstream is the only workstream focused on the wider picture of the product suite’s uptime, functionality, and overall health. It additionally mirrors that responsibility in the DAO Discord and Notion by synergizing and coordinating cross stream collaboration further strengthening the DAO.\n\nSpecification\nThe Operations workstream Notion repo can be found here.\n\nThe renewal for this workstream and contributors is 6 months from February 1st to July 31st. This proposal continues @Tyler | ShapeShift as the workstream leader and @Tshifty @Lych @Ron/PTT and @Neverwas as Operations Assistants with the additional budget to hire 4 additional assistants in 2 waves during the term.\n\nBudget: Total potential max budget $411,000 (6 months)\nBudget breakdown can be viewed on the Forum post here: https://forum.shapeshift.com/t/scp-59-proposal-to-fund-the-operations-workstream-for-a-second-term/1085\n\nThe changes to the budget from the previous term is the addition of another potential assistant, an increase in the allotted monthly test fund budget to meet the growing needs of test requirements and network fees, the addition of a $2K/month bounty fund, and an increase in the discretionary funds to $1k/month for a larger team. As with the previous budget, all unused funds will be returned to the DAO treasury (Root) at the end of the term.\n\nSpecific Goals and Success Metrics\nThe goals and success metrics for the Operations Workstream are broken into two sections in this term, current measurables, and focuses for future KPIs next term.\n\nCurrent Measurables:\n\nProduction Issue Best Practices\n\nGoals:\n\nTo minimize downtime of the entire product suite.\nTo resolve production environment bugs efficiently with minimal disruption to engineering processes, deployment cadences, or user experience.\nKPIs:\n\n99% uptime of the product suite and services (99.969% last term)\n<10 Production Issue Escalations per Quarter (8 Escalations in Q4 2021)\n<50 Total Combined DAO Contributor hours dedicated to Production Issue Resolutions (Q4 2021 - 20 hours)\nTriage Management\n\nGoals:\n\nTo discover, isolate, navigate, and manage resolutions of user facing issues in all ShapeShift products and services.\nTo provide known troubleshooting and mitigation steps for issue reporters and users during the discovery and recreation of triage tickets.\nTo mitigate and expedite time required from core contributors spent on bug tickets, issue reports, and production level emergencies.\nTo transfer correctly completed and accurate Github tickets of triage bugs to Engineering or Product to be posted for bounty.\nKPIs:\n\nGreater than 80% resolution rate goal (86.55% resolution rate last term)\nDeployment and Regression Testing\n\nGoals:\n\nTo catch 95% of prod issues during deployment testing process.\nTo catch user facing issues in production environments in regression tests and #triage them accordingly.\nA deployment test completed twice by the Operations Workstream during each release process:\nA full regression test performed once a day by an Operations Workstream contributor.\nOperations prioritizes blocking bugs, supporting engineers, and efficiency in the processes already in place over chasing non-blocking bugs for a ‘perfected’ release.\nKPIs:\n\n<2 Cadences missed per quarter due to bugs overlooked in Ops Testing (1 cadence missed last term)\n<2 Rollbacks during releases per quarter due to bugs overlooked in Ops Testing (2 Rollbacks occurred last term)\nDAO Admin Procedures and Practices\n\nGoals:\n\nTo organize successful DAO meetings related to Goat/No Goat, Retros, and Ops Sprints.\nTo track, organize, record keep, and optimize DAO repos keeping them current and relevant.\nTo provide assistance in projects that require support in generating procedures to be completed for the DAO or other workstreams.\nNext Term Success Metrics:\nNow that the workstream has been established and developed a bit, future focuses of KPIs for the second term include:\n\nKPIs for DAO Admin procedure practices\nKPIs around regression testing template times, and completion rate\nKPIs around lowering test fund costs compared to network fees\nKPIs about bugs turned into successful bounties by Operations Contributors\nAdditional focus and detail added to current KPIs based on the numbers and data collected\nBenefits\nIf this proposal passes, the DAO will continue to fund the Operations workstream budget to meet the deliverables and services outlined which are integral to the DAO’s success and current practices. Coverage for Prod Issue escalations Triage Management Regularly scheduled regression and deployment testing Cross workstream alignment and stakeholder resources would all be focuses maintained and improved upon by the workstream.\n\nPassing this proposal will continue uninterrupted support and services offered from the Operations workstream to the DAO.\n\nDrawbacks\nFunding this workstream does cost money and the budget does have a slight increase from last month in regards to team size and test fund allocations. This workstream would cost the DAO treasury potentially $411,000 over 6 months (~$68,500/month) if all funds are needed and exhausted in the budget.\n\nVote\n\nFor: You support funding the Operations Workstream’s anticipated budget for 6 months totaling $411,000\n\nAgainst: You do not support continuing to fund the Operations Workstream.",

      "content": "Summary:\nThis is a proposal for ShapeShift to commission an initiation of coverage report, via the Messari Hub. This would serve to better inform the crypto ecosystem what ShapeShift is building and why it matters.\n\nAbstract:\nIn an effort to scale the amount of quality, long-form research for the community, we are proposing ShapeShift commissions research reports through their existing membership in the Messari Hub. This would provide a comprehensive overview of the protocol and how it fits into the broader crypto landscape. The report will touch on major key performance indicators and fundamental metrics comparing them to competitors while also discussing the token mechanics and any value accrual mechanism.\n\nThese reports would live as free resources on Messari and would be distributed through our newsletter (210k subscribers) and various social channels.\n\nMotivation:\nCrypto suffers from information overload. The number of innovative projects is increasing at an exponential rate making it difficult for even the most active participants in the space to stay informed. While projects can help provide information on how the protocol works, there is substantial benefit from analysis contextualizing how it fits into the broader crypto landscape.\n\nThere are several research firms (Messari included) that have analysts writing about projects they find interesting that then live behind a paywall. However, we believe given the open-source nature of crypto there should be more freely available research which is why we work with over 100 DAOs and grant programs to fund quality research as a public goods initiative.\n\nSpecification:\nThe report will follow our “Initiation of Coverage” format that we have done for several projects including:\n\nPerpetual Protocol\nhttps://messari.io/article/perpetual-protocol-nobel-prizeworthy-derivatives\nNotional Finance\nhttps://messari.io/article/notional-finance-borrowing-and-lending-at-fixed-rates-in-crypto\nAnchor \nhttps://messari.io/article/return-to-jekyll-island-the-rise-of-anchor-protocol?referrer=category:hub\nBefore getting started, we will send over a report outline to members of the team to see if there are any areas in particular they think we should delve into more. After that our team will complete the report which will live as a free resource on our site and be distributed through our newsletter (200k subscribers) and various social channels.\n\nThe total cost will be an upfront payment of $25,000 payable in stablecoins.\n\nBenefits:\nThe benefit of the report would be increased knowledge and awareness of ShapeShift for the larger crypto community. The exposure ShapeShift would receive through this report would help attract more users, developers, and investors who are more likely to allocate time and money to provide value to the overall network after being more abreast of the material developments going on.\n\nDrawbacks:\nThe only drawback of this would be the cost and whether or not the community thinks the use of funds would be better spent elsewhere.\n\nProposal:\nWe propose that ShapeShift commissions an initiation of coverage report that provides a comprehensive overview of the protocol and how it fits into the broader crypto landscape. The report will touch on major key performance indicators and fundamental metrics comparing them to competitors while also discussing the token mechanics and any value accrual mechanisms.\n\nThe total cost will be an upfront payment of $25,000 payable in stablecoins.\n\nVote:\nA vote “for” this proposal indicates you are in favor of spending $25,000 to commission an initiation of coverage report via the Messari Hub.\n\nA vote “against” this proposal indicates you are NOT in favor of spending $25,000 to commission an initiation of coverage report via the Messari Hub.",

      "title": "[SCP-57] Create the FOXCHAIN Workstream with @mperklin as Workstream Leader",
      "content": "# 1. Summary\nIn order to fully decentralize the backend of ShapeShift it is vital to have a source of reliable, indexed, and decentralized node data for all chains that are supported by the ShapeShift interface. If anyone is going to host decentralized copies of indexed node data, there needs to be an incentivization structure in place to reward them for their work. \nFOXChain, a purpose-built blockchain built on the cosmos SDK, has been proposed to solve both problems and has been discussed numerous times in the ShapeShift DAO community over the last 45 days. The purpose of this proposal is to formalize and fund the next steps of the development of this important piece of decentralized infrastructure.\n\n# 2. Abstract\nThis proposal outlines the first phase of necessary actions to be taken in order to make FOXCHAIN a reality. This first phase will fund the following deliverables to the ShapeShift DAO community:\n\n1. A technical scope document, including engineering requirements for FOXChain as well as any necessary diagrams and supporting documentation\n2. A spreadsheet that models the necessary FOX support needed for supporting the security of FOXChain and related tokenomics of supporting the chain\n3. a Proof of Concept built on top of the Cosmos SDK that will serve as the initial reference implementation of FOXChain for testnet purposes\n4. The hiring of an engineering lead and supporting team who will support (1), (2), and (3) and be poised to rapidly iterate into phase 2 of fully building out the FOXChain once the (1), (2), and (3) are fully delivered to the community.\n\nNote: Cosmos is proposed as an ideal candidate due to its a) Tendermint consensus, and b) bonding/slashing mechanisms required for the implementation of FOXChain.\n\n# 3. Motivation\nThe motivation for building FOXChain runs on a number of different paths, but primarily it serves as the long term decentralized backend for all node data the ShapeShift interface will ever need. FOXCHAIN will act as a service for any application requiring reliable access to a consistent interface to any of the supported blockchains, in order to increase dapp development velocity, reduce reliance on centralized data sources, remove single points of failure, and increase censorship-resistance. On top of this there are many additional benefits that can be built out once the ShapeShift DAO has its own sovereign blockchain, though that does not serve as the primary motivation at this phase.\n\n# 4. Specification\nIn order to move forward on the creation of FOXChain, this proposal asks for the creation of a purpose built workstream and appointing Michael Perklin (@mperklin) as its workstream leader. The workstream will deliver on (1), (2), (3), and (4) as defined in the abstract. In more a detailed sense this includes:\n\n1. The workstream will work on breaking down the technical scope of the FOXChain, including getting feedback from various technical stakeholders in the DAO and larger crypto community (such as Cosmos core devs, other Cosmos SDK chain developers, and other DeFi projects) in order to produce a full initial technical requirements document and any necessary design diagrams to inform future developers of FOXChain.\n2. The workstream will work with contributors to model out the tokenomics of FOXChain including the costs associated with running each ShapeShift supported blockchain and index, projected necessary FOX needed to subsidize months/years of node subsidies, FOXChain revenue generation for the DAO over the long term, and any other components to properly model FOXChain tokenomics.\n3. The workstream will work to either hire or bounty out developers in order to produce a FOXChain proof of concept which will be informed by (1) and (2) and will serve to launch the initial FOXChain testnet which can be iterated on in phase 2 to launch FOXChain into production.\n4. The workstream will work to hire an engineering lead and supporting team who can support (1), (2), and (3) as necessary but also more importantly so that team can be poised to be funded in phase 2 to iterate and launch the production version of FOXChain to mainnet.\n\nIn order to deliver on the above Phase 1 FOXChain scope, this proposal requests 300,000 USDC as funding (or equivalent FOX). If funded, Michael Perklin will take receipt of these 300,000 USDC at his consulting company (ETH address 0x9125F9e3FB19C57A341311Ab70Ba591333a333B3) and will have full authority to spend this 300,000 USDC in any way he feels will make progress towards achieving the FOXCHAIN objectives laid out in this proposal. The funding will be transferred in three separate 100,000 USDC transactions over three months. Any funds remaining after these objectives have been fulfilled will either be retained to fulfill future \"Phase 2\" proposals for FOXCHAIN, or will be returned to the DAO treasury if the DAO decides no future work on FOXCHAIN will be funded. Michael Perklin will be responsible for maintaining records related to the disbursement of funds and will share these records with ShapeShift DAO to ensure transparency.\n\n# 5. Benefits\nThe benefits of this proposal will include the first necessary steps to create FOXChain, a vital piece of infrastructure needed to decentralize ShapeShift’s backend and also provide the world and other interfaces with essential infrastructure (reliable, incentivized, indexed, blockchain data across many blockchains). In addition to this vital infrastructure, FOXChain will also likely become a significant source of revenue for the DAO over the long term if the project is successful.\n\n# 6. Drawbacks\nThe drawbacks of this proposal will be that it is a considerable sum to invest at this stage with no guarantee of success. The DAO will have to trust Mperklin to diligently put the right people and pieces in place to deliver on the scope laid out in this proposal. It is possible that phase 2 is not funded, and this never gets delivered to a production mainnet. It is also possible that a better solution or other alternative solutions out in the market end up being better suited to solve what FOXChain is trying to solve.\n",

      "title": "[SCP-55] Revised Liquidity Mining & LP Token Purchases",
      "content": "This proposal outlines a revised approach for our liquidity mining efforts that combines ongoing liquidity mining incentives with a concerted effort to control our own liquidity. This would effectively extend and modify the current phase, which ends in late-February.\n\nThe strategy entails maintaining liquidity mining rewards near or at current levels for an additional 4.5 months, while at the same time aggressively increasing the DAO’s Olympus Pro bond LP token purchases. This could reduce the effective cost of liquidity mining, while also jumpstarting a program to put the majority of the DAO’s liquidity in its own treasury.\n\nThe Big Picture\n\nCurrently ShapeShift is spending a substantial amount of FOX in order to maintain our liquidity mining program. This plays an important role in both ensuring that FOX has a presence on Uniswap and throughout the DeFi ecosystem, as well as expanding the universe of FOX holders.\n\nAt the same time, the DAO is operating in an environment where various newer DeFi protocols have enabled protocol treasuries to hold their own liquidity. This new paradigm allows projects to enjoy the best of both worlds, ensuring that there’s sufficient liquidity while avoiding typical downsides that arise from liquidity mining–for instance, “mercenary” liquidity providers who quickly head for the exits and sell a token soon after they earn those rewards.\n\nThe two steps contained in this proposal would effectively allow the DAO to engage in both behaviors: continuing its liquidity mining rewards while also using its ample FOX reserves to begin purchasing its own liquidity via an Olympus bond.\n\nWhat this proposal would do:\n\n1.) Continue our current liquidity mining rewards in the Uniswap FOX/ETH pool for an additional 4.5 months, targeting a 75% APR or higher (funded with 13.5 mil FOX over the period). This mirrors our current approach.\n\n2.) Utilize our current FOX/ETH Olympus Pro bond in order to aggressively purchase our own liquidity. Specifically, the DAO would fund an Olympus Bond program over the following 4.5 months (concurrent with the ongoing LP program) to purchase FOX/ETH LP tokens, targeting $40 million worth of liquidity. $50 million worth of FOX would be earmarked and deployed for this purpose over the course of the 4.5-month period.\n\nNote that the strategy outlined here doesn’t speak much to how exactly we’ll implement the LP repurchases via Olympus. This ambiguity is intentional; it leaves our team enough flexibility, with respect to both position sizing and timing, to react to market feedback. For instance, If our bonds are not selling and/or liquidity starts rapidly declining (and not just because of markets in general dropping), this would suggest that we should adjust the strategy.\n\nThat said, it’s likely that we’d begin the program very aggressively, perhaps with 10X to 20X our current purchases, in order to quickly increase our Protocol Owned Liquidity.\n\nWith respect to management of the revised bond program’s parameters, the existing FOX Bond Committee would be a logical choice; it already had competency and knowledge around these operations. The Committee’s current term expires at the end of the current bond program. Should it be amenable to renewing for another 4.5 months under the modified proposal, its ongoing work would be invaluable in executing this proposal’s strategy.\n\nWhat exactly does this vote do?\n\nYES:\n\n1.) On February 22nd at 9am MST (48 hours before the second round of FOX/ETH liquidity mining ends), deploy a third round of liquidity mining rewards for the Uniswap v2 FOX/ETH Pool of 13.5M FOX rewarded over 4.5 months (targeting 75% or higher APR).\n\n2.) Fund an aggressive Olympus Bond program over the following 4.5 months (concurrent with the ongoing LP program) to purchase FOX/ETH LP tokens, targeting $40 million worth of liquidity. $50 million worth of FOX would be earmarked and deployed for this purpose over the course of the 4.5-month period.\n\nNO: No changes are made. (In this case, the DAO will need to pass another proposal if it wants to extend its liquidity mining program past late-February).",

This proposal is scoped to one blockchain, Osmosis.\n\nAbstract - Osmosis is an Automatic Market Maker (AMM) Decentralized Exchange (DEX) built on the cosmos SDK. ShapeShift DAO is currently building out an integration to support Osmosis functionality in the web app and mobile app. Osmosis Integration Post [https://app.boardroom.info/shapeshift/proposal/cHJvcG9zYWw6c2hhcGVzaGlmdDpkZWZhdWx0OnFtbnV5Y3NyZXhmZXN5dG9mazZlbWRzYW1vcnVpMXBjdnU0aGpwN2V5ZHZuZ3o=]  TaxiStake has established its ability to operate a ShapeShift validator on the Cosmos chain and is proposing that the DAO establish a second validator, on the Osmosis chain.\n\nSpecification - We are proposing that the ShapeShift DAO continues to support and secure the Osmosis ecosystem by creating a ShapeShift DAO validator on the Osmosis chain. Setup and maintenance of the validator will be done by TaxiStake under the ShapeShift brand name. Rewards, in the form of USDT, would be distributed to the DAO’s Gnosis Safe to diversify the income streams of the DAO.\nIn the first month of operation, the ShapeShift DAO Cosmos validator has attracted over 1,500,000 ATOMs from delegators. In the first month, this generated 1,185.554836 ATOMs from commission.

      "title": "[SCP-53] ETHDENVER Sponsorship & Events",
      "content": "\nThe following proposal will allow the DAO to create a powerful presence at ETHDenver. This would include the sponsorship, hosting two events, and fund scholarships for ShapeShift DAO members to attend.\n\nMotivation: Centralized ShapeShift has been attending and sponsoring ETHDenver for the last 5 years, as this event was in our own backyard. Now that we are a DAO and decentralized, we should consider many events, but what better way to start this DAO sponsorship theme than through our roots at ETHDenver. We would also be supporting another DAO, as with the genesis of Spork DAO in June 2021, ETHDenver is the first event based DAO in the world.\n\nOur motivation to sponsor this event is the exposure and supporting the BUIDLer community around us. These attendees are motivated, educated and the right type of connections for our DAO to be building. The attendees of this event include students, developers, technologists, community leaders, educational professionals, entrepreneurs and more.\n\nETH Denver Event Sponsorship:\n\nMetaLite Sponsorship - $20,000\nBenefits\n3 Sporkwhale tickets\nLogo on promos and PR\nSocial, Blog and PR communications\nSponsor table\nBounty Prize Limit: $15,000\n1 Panel Spot or 1 Workshop\nBounties - $15,000\nSwag for the table, and incentives to achieve our goals. $6,500\nTshirts/ Stickers\n$500 of this budget would go to designs\nScholarships for DAO community members to attend $6,500\nWhile the event is a free event, it does require travel to get out here. We would like to be able to fund at least 8 ShapeShift DAO members with a $800 scholarship to offset the costs of travel. They would have to work a shift at the booth and attend/ help host the party. Denver residents are not eligible.\nWorkstreams can still sponsor the remainder of the cost of the trip for DAO community members.\nETH Denver Event Sponsorship Total: $48,000\n\nFundraiser for Coin Center/ VIP Dinner Event (48 attendees):\n\nBeing a new DAO, many of us are interested in supporting the work of Coin Center. Coin Center is the leading non-profit focused on the policy issues facing cryptocurrencies. They engage in research, educate policymakers, and advocate for sensible regulatory approaches to this technology. Another reason for hosting a fundraiser as the DAO is to show we have a vested interest in this community and its future.\n\nThe theme of the dinner will be Wild West Pioneers. We will invite a few VIP guests of honor who have founded or greatly contributed to the Denver/ Colorado crypto ecosystem, including Erik Voorhees. This event will be sponsored by the ShapeShift DAO and will cost attendees a 0.5- 1 ETH donation to CoinCenter to attend. Our goal is to raise $100,000 - $200,000 for Coin Center and garner more exposure for our DAO. (Note: These amounts are subject to change, based on which VIP Guests we can secure.)\n\nWe would also like to create a 1-of-48 NFT set for the attendees of this party. There is a budget for design and minting below.\n\nVIP Dinner / Coin Center Fundraiser:\n\nPlated dinner for 48 - $7,300\nAlcohol - $2,000\nNFT design and minting - $2,500\nVIP Dinner / Coin Center Fundraiser Total: $11,800\n\nPre-Party for ETHDenver: 225 attendees:\n\nWhile the conference brings professional relationships and contacts with BUIDLers in the community, event parties typically provide a space to build long lasting relationships and opportunities for the DAO.\n\nETH Denver Pre Party:\n\nShuttle buses for the evening - $5,000\nHeavy appetizers - $10,000\nStaff - $3,000\nAlcohol - $7,000\nEntertainment - $5,500\nFurniture rental - $2,000\nCleaning costs - $2,000\nEvent Planning Committee - $5,000\nETH Denver Pre Party Total: $39,500\n\nETHDENVER Total $99,300\n\nThe TMDC will facilitate the necessary USDC exposure for this proposal.\n\nBenefits:\n\nColorado is at the forefront of new organizational structures and business models, Colorado Governor Jared Polis announced at the 2021 ETHDenver that Colorado intends to become the “first digital state” We would like to continue to build our relationship with Colorado and help them understand the benefits of DAOs.\nWe would like to raise money for CoinCenter in hopes that we can help them to educate lawmakers and stakeholders about the benefits of DAOs.\n\nDrawbacks:\n\nThe ask for $99,300 is not a small one, it should be considered carefully and weighed with the benefits and possible opportunities our DAO would create by sponsoring and attending these events.",

      "title": "[SCP-51] Proposal to Fund the Marketing Workstream through June 30, 2022",
      "content": "Summary:\n\nFund a Marketing Workstream focused on creating a marketing machine for the DAO. To spread the message of our product, drive new and existing users to the mutually beneficial yield farming opportunities therein, and report success metrics back to the DAO.\n____________________________________________________________\nAbstract:\n\nThe Marketing Workstream plays a vital role in promoting the DAO by engaging users, creating marketing campaigns, and executing them across the digital landscape. It is the engine that drives the spreading of the DAO message, coordinating and producing all materials representing our decentralized organization. We believe that our strategies will continue to help achieve our shared vision of a borderless financial system. This is a proposal to fund the Marketing Workstream through June 30, 2022.\n____________________________________________________________\n\nMotivation:\n\nThe ShapeShift DAO has attracted talent from all over the web and retained fantastic talent from the previous centralized organization. Products continue to be built, and our systems’ capability continues to grow. The Marketing Workstream intends to closely collaborate with the Product Team in order to make current and new users aware of what ShapeShift’s systems capabilities and functions are. Ultimately, we are aiming to acquire and activate new and existing users towards revenue-generating points.\n\nBy creating a workstream that focuses on strategizing, developing, executing, and tracking marketing initiatives for the DAO - any workstream or individual can contribute to ShapeShift DAO marketing. We will collaborate with the DAO and be the workstream responsible for these efforts.\n____________________________________________________________\n\nSpecification:\n\nPropose and execute marketing campaigns that support product launches, partnership agreements, and project integrations.\n\nProduce and distribute quality marketing content for the community.\n\nStrategize community growth and management across Reddit, Telegram, Instagram, Facebook, and other community media outlets.\n\nDrive users to revenue-generating actions and report back to the DAO on progress, current actionable items, and KPIs.\n\nContinually refine and improve strategies across the DAO’s marketing initiatives and community growth.\n\nBuild a workstream that empowers everyone working within the subcommittee to feel heard and at home with the ShapeShift DAO community.\n____________________________________________________________\n\nSpecific Goals & Success Metrics:\n\n1) Leverage Social Media: One of the most important marketing tools for the DAO is social media. Perhaps even more so in the crypto/defi space, the marketing team shall use social media effectively to connect with the global crypto community and put the spotlight onto various DAO projects.\n\nThe marketing workstream shall be responsible for creating, distributing content and growing the following social media platforms:\n\n - Facebook - Increase followers to 60,000 by June 30th, 2022 (a 19% increase)\n - Instagram - Increase followers to 10,000 by June 30th, 2022 (a 90% increase)\n - Reddit - Increase average unique engagement to 1,500 per month by June 30th, 2022 (a 15% increase)\n - Telegram - Increase followers to 3,500 by June 30th, 2022 (a 45% increase)\n - Youtube - Increase followers to 4,500 by June 30th, 2022 (a 32% increase)\n - Medium - Increase followers to 4,500 by June 30th, 2022 (a 40% increase)\n\n - Influencer/Affiliate Marketing: There are influencers who are well recognised and respected within the crypto community. Users become confident in projects for many reasons, and if a person they trust is on board with ShapeShift DAO, that is one way we can attract potential FOX holders. Our current best thinking is to engage with a specific type of influencer that meets some or all of the following criteria:\n- Focuses on DeFi Projects.\n- Produces content focused on earning yield on digital assets - rather than buying, waiting for the price to increase, and selling.\n- Understands the utility of the tokens they recommend to their audiences, and can explain how users can best put their token to work.\n- Ideally, we find content creators that help us kill 2 birds with one stone. There is a focus on utility throughout the $FOX ecosystem while at the same time providing tutorial-like instructions though the visual content they create.\n\nDue to the variability in costs when working with influencers, the goal for the workstream during this term is to identify and connect with influencers that meet the DAO’s standards. If the cost of working with an influencer is reasonable, the workstream may fund the partnership through the bounty budget. If the cost would be a significant portion of the bounty budget proposed by the workstream, we plan to present and write separate funding proposals.\n\n3. Content Creation & SEO: By creating content regularly for ShapeShift’s website, search engines will assign more value to it, and thus the website will show up more frequently for terms related to our brand. The website is often the first (and in some cases the only) place people go for information about ShapeShift. The Marketing Workstream will be responsible for keeping Web content current and working with the Product Workstream to execute necessary UI/UX changes.\n\nA non-exhaustive list of content the workstream will create, optimize, and publish to the website and external channels includes:\n\n- Weekly and Monthly ShapeShift DAO Newsletters.\n- Blogs (both long and short form).\nWritten and video content on processes, walk-throughs and news in the DAO.\n- Graphic design content to be used for engaging audiences on various social media platforms.\n\n4. Press Releases: Publishing press releases is essential in spreading the message of the DAO due to the legitimacy it confers on the project. By creating content suitable for PR and amplifying it with formal press releases, the DAO shows maturity and legitimacy as a brand (ShapeShift) and as a project (ShapeShift DAO).\n\n5. Support the Community: The workstream will build a connection with the community outside of Discord by engaging and answering questions on various social platforms. The workstream will nurture the relationship with the community on a daily basis by being active within the channels and seeding conversation with content created by the DAO.\n\n6. Data DAOshboards: The workstream will work to build a series of dashboards for anyone in the DAO to track progress on:\n\n- Activated FOX - which is FOX that is locked within a contract and not sitting in a wallet, segmented by each opportunity.\n- Number of FOX Token Holders\n- Growth of External Channels\n- A series of dashboards would serve all DAO workstreams tremendously by providing insights to valuable ecosystem data and metrics.\n____________________________________________________________\nProposed Workstream Roles:\n\nFull Time Roles:\n\nWorkstream Leader & Data Lead - @Petecoin\nContent Creation & Distribution Lead - @Arina\nSocial & Community Growth Lead - @ETHan1Elohim\nVideo Streaming & Management - @PTT\n\nBounty Roles that can turn into Part Time / Full Time Roles:\n\nDAO Analytics Manager\nSocial Media Channel Managers\nCopywriters\nGraphic Designers\nVideographers\nEmail Managers\n_________________________________________________________________\nBudget:\n\nhttps://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard10/uploads/foxcookieco/original/1X/e8c6888eff003ec21445ff68cf0b0647996aeff6.png\n\nTotal 6 Month Requested Budget: $351,086\n\nThe budget is designed with these conditions in mind:\n\n - The bounty budget proposed by this workstream is intended to be used to grow the talent pool proposed above - and leave room for valuable bounty hunters to become part or full time contributors.\n   - The intended result is to create a series of redundancies in talent so that the workstream can remain agile to meet marketing demands.\n    - $15,000 per month is split into three buckets:\n    - $5,000 for Content Creation\n    - $5,000 for Community & Social\n    - $5,000 for Data\n  - Any bounty contractors that become full or part time contributors will be compensated either through the bounty budget, or by a separate proposal submitted through DAO governance.\n\n - Any unused funds at the end of the 6 month term will be returned to the DAO with a report released to the community that details where all funds were spent 2. No funding will be rolled over into any subsequent term if this workstream continues past June 30, 2022.\n_________________________________________________________________\nBenefits:\n\nThis workstream ensures that the DAO continues to make current and new users aware of what ShapeShift’s systems capabilities and functions are. Ultimately aiming to acquire and activate new and existing users towards revenue-generating points & reporting all activity back to the DAO at the end of the term.\n\nDrawbacks:\n\nThe main drawback is the cost to fund this workstream, however, we strongly believe a Marketing Workstream is a necessary branch of the DAO and we hope that the community has seen the value and will continue to support us.\n",

      "title": "[SCP-46] Establish a Reponsible Disclosure Program",
      "content": "I propose that the DAO establish a Responsible Disclosure Program to incentivize security researchers to test our products for vulnerabilities and report them in a way that helps us protect our users.\n\n## Disclosure Policy\n\nAs a DAO, all our code and systems are public, and we must assume that it’s only a matter of time before any vulnerability we receive a report about is discovered by the bad guys. Experience running the centralized RDP has also provided the valuable insight that hanging onto reports for too long presents serious record-keeping issues. Thus, I propose that the DAO’s RDP have an explicit 90-day disclosure policy, with all reports actively published after they are remediated, or after 90 days, whichever comes first.\n\n## Scope\n\nThis program will cover:\n\n - Smart contract code developed by the DAO\n - Smart contract code deployed by the DAO on-chain on a mainnet\n - The specific projects hosted at the following GitHub repositories:\n   - shapeshift/web\n   - shapeshift/lib\n   - shapeshift/unchained\n   - shapeshift/hdwallet\n   - keepkey/keepkey-firmware\n\nIn addition, any software hosted under the ShapeShift or KeepKey GitHub Orgs or the @shapeshiftoss NPM Org will be eligible if it is a dependency of something in-scope.\n\n## Specification\n\n### NFT Hall of Fame\n\nI propose that the DAO fund the creation of an NFT-based Hall of Fame on the xDai chain, and that recognition for a researcher’s contributions be provided in tokenized form.\n\n1) A security researcher who submits a valid report will receive an NFT, which will be locked for the duration of the RDP’s 90-day disclosure period. If the issue they’ve reported is later found to be invalid – or if they choose to disclose it publicly during the embargo period – the NFT will be revoked.\n2) The NFT will be unlocked automatically upon the expiration of the disclosure period, or earlier once the issue is remediated. Once unlocked, the NFT will pay to its holder a small, fixed bounty, as compensation for their effort in reporting the issue.\n3) The Bounty Committee will meet on a regular basis to evaluate all newly-remediated issues and assign bounties to them. Bounties will be paid out to the holder of the associated NFT. This will enable the researcher to “cash out” early, without needing to wait for the Bounty Committee, by selling their NFT. (Prospective buyers will likely be knowledgeable both about the issue's security impact and the DAO's bounty process, and who thus experience less risk by holding the asset than the researcher themselves.)\n4) The NFT’s metadata will include name and URL fields which the researcher may set and then lock. This ensures that they will retain the credit for their report, even if they do sell the NFT. (The DAO will retain the ability to override a locked NFT's metadata in case of the exercise of Godwin's Law or other exceptional circumstances.)\n\nThe Security Workstream will manage the issuance and revocation these NFTs.\n\n### Bounty Committee\n\nA Bounty Committee will be established for the purpose of reviewing and assigning bounty values to remediated reports. This committee should have good technical and security credentials, but should also represent a cross-section of the DAO community. Its purpose is to avoid the potentially-problematic process of allocating a “budget” for bounties while providing confidence to the DAO that bounty funds will be well-allocated, as well as to provide assurance to security researchers and prospective holders of Hall of Fame NFTs that reports will receive serious consideration and fair awards.\n\n(Bounty awards are necessarily more qualitative than quantitative, but I also feel that it would be wise for the Committee to publish some general guidelines on what general types of issues will be awarded at what general amounts.)\n\nThe Bounty Committee’s recommendations will be submitted to the DAO in the form of proposals to pay specific bounty amounts directly from the treasury to the holder of a specific Hall of Fame NFT. These bounty proposals may go directly to a vote, skipping the normal forum and ideation steps of the governance process. This will allow the DAO to retain operation oversight of the amounts awarded.\n\nConsidering the impact and complexity of vulnerabilities is highly-skilled and mentally-demanding work, and the members of the the Bounty Committee will need to do it regularly. As such, they will be paid on an hourly basis for their work meeting and scoring reports.\n\nThe Bounty Committee will always contain the current Security Workstream leader; In addition, I nominate @willyfox, @0xdef1cafe, @mperklin, @majorhayes, @adam, and @0xcean, for a starting size of 7 members.\n\n### De-minimis Bounties\n\nAll valid reports deserve some financial recognition, no matter how serious the issue is; there's real overhead associated with engaging with us and reporting responsibly. Researchers should be incentivized by a guaranteed payout to do that even if they're not sure how serious an issue might be, and the Bounty Committee should not feel obligated to burden the DAO with proposals to award bounties to very-low-impact reports.\n\nThe “de minimis” bounty is compensation for participating in the administrative overhead of the reporting process, as well as a good-will bonus. It will be the same for every issue irrespective of the issue’s impact or technical complexity; those factors will be considered by the Bounty Committee and may result in an additional award. It will be paid automatically upon remediation of the issue or expiry of the 90-day confidentiality period.\n\nBounty awards by the committee will be paid in FOX, but the de-minimis bounties will instead be paid in xDai. Paying in xDai avoids the need for an on-chain price oracle to ensure the consistent value of payouts, and also ensures that even researchers new to xDai or crypto entirely will have enough gas to work with after an award.\n\n## Budget\n\n### Development of Hall of Fame contract\n\nThe contract powering the NFT Hall of Fame will not be handling large amounts of money or any user funds, so it won't need the same level of paranoia as most DeFi smart contracts, and I don't see an external audit as an essential part of the process. The DAO should retain the ability to edit or censor NFT metadata, and shenanigans should be revertable. (I envision the Hall of Fame being deployed as an upgradable proxy owned by the DAO's Colony instance.)\n\nOpenZeppelin has most of the infrastructure needed for development of a custom NFT contract like the Hall of Fame; I don't see this as a huge lift, but it will require development, and the work should be compensated. It would be a great choice for outsourcing via a Gitcoin bounty or something similar.\n\nUpon passage of this proposal, $15,000 will be allotted to the Security Workstream for bounties related to the development of the Hall of Fame.\n\n### On-Call Rotation\n\nThe Security Workstream will run an on-call rotation to triage and respond to vulnerability reports. While subject to change as operationally indicated, this will initially take the form of week-long on-call slots.\n\nOn passage of this proposal, $26,000 will be allotted to the Security Workstream for coverage of the first 6 months of this duty. Workstream members on call may request reimbursement at the rate of $1000/week.\n\n### Software Licenses (i.e. ZenDesk)\n\nThough we may transition to a different solution in the future, for the moment ZenDesk is a good fit for our needs. ZenDesk licenses are $150 per seat per month, and I anticipate that running a continuous on-call rotation will require a pool of at least four people.\n\nUpon passage of this proposal, $2400 will be allotted to the Security Workstream at the rate of $600/month for the next 6 months. The Security Workstream will request renewal of this allocation as required via its ordinary budget process.\n\n### Bounty Committee\n\nBounty Committee members will be compensated at a rate of $150/hour. Committee member workloads are estimated to be around 2-4 hours per month.\n\nUpon passage of this proposal, $25,200 will be allocated to the Security Workstream at the rate of $4200/month for the next 6 months. The Security Workstream will request renewal of this allocation as required via its ordinary budget process.\n\n### De-minimis Bounties\n\nDe-minimis bounties will be 200 xDAI. (The centralized org used $50, which in my opinion is much too low and attracts the wrong caliber of researcher.) I believe that $200 is a rate that will make researchers feel appreciated and encourage their further engagement with the DAO, which is one of the program's goals; there's an aspect of paying for talent, or at least to attract *potential* talent.\n\nUpon passage of this proposal, 10,000 xDai will be allocated to the Security Workstream to fund these bounties; the Security Workstream will request any top-up funds required via its ordinary budget process.\n\n### Test funds / gas costs\n\nSetup and administration of the Hall of Fame will require funds in xDai for testing and gas to make the calls necessary to operate the contract. Upon passage of this proposal, 1000 xDai will be allotted to the Security Workstream for use as general testing/gas funds. This will provide enough funds to perform full-scale testing and also cover the gas cost of operating the Hall of Fame contract for quite a while.\n\n## Voting\n\n- Yes: Establish the RDP and allocate funds as described.\n- No: Do nothing at this time.",

      "title": "[SCP-48] Tokemak Reactor Funding via Treasury Fox",
      "content": "This proposal outlines a strategy for earning revenue from the ShapeShift Tokemak reactor. Specifically, the DAO would fund the reactor with up to $30 million worth of FOX from the DAO’s treasury, and in return could generate a substantial revenue stream in the form of TOKE rewards.\n\nThe Big Picture\n\nThe ShapeShift DAO is sitting on a large amount of untapped potential in the form of its extensive FOX treasury (roughly $200 million at the time of this writing). Thanks to DeFi, there are myriad ways in which we can generate yield on those assets. That revenue, in turn, could potentially be used for treasury diversification and redistribution to FOX holders, and employed in other beneficial ways.\n\n(The ShapeShift treasury can be viewed here: https://etherscan.io/address/0x90a48d5cf7343b08da12e067680b4c6dbfe551be)\n\nWhat’s the potential upside?\n\nAssuming current prices of FOX and TOKE, as well as an average Fox Reactor APR of 50% (currently it’s at 43%), a deposit of $30 million worth of FOX (roughly 15% of the current treasury) would generate about $1.25 million in TOKE rewards per month. ($30 million at 50% = $15 mil/yr or $1.25 mil/mo)\n\nTOKE also potentially bears significant value to ShapeShift DAO as the governance token of the Tokemak protocol, which is used to allocate both TOKE rewards and vault liquidity, helping secure deep FOX liquidity and offsetting the need for ongoing liquidity mining programs.\n\nFurther, TOKE rewards can also be staked for additional TOKE yield of 50%+ for maximum yield.\n\nWhat are the potential downsides and risks?\n\nDue to the “balancing game” mechanics behind Tokemak, a sizable deposit of FOX would lead to a substantial decline in the reactor’s APR for FOX rewards–not great for those staking FOX in the pool. However, the very same balancing mechanics would likely lead to a recovery in that APR within a few days: when the APR on the FOX side of our reactor goes down from a large deposit, the APR on the TOKE side goes up, incentivizing the “rebalancing” of the rewards. This, in turn, should encourage TOKE voters to balance out the reactor and bring rewards back up to match the deposit.\n\nWith respect to risks: in the worst-case scenario, a smart contract bug or exploit could completely drain our Tokemak reactor, leading to the loss of all of the DAO’s reactor-held funds. While the DAO would live to fight another day, losing up to $30 million would certainly be an unwelcome development–a setback in terms of both optics and almost certainly the short-term price of FOX.\n\nWhat exactly does this Proposal do?\n\nYES: Up to $30 million worth of FOX will be deposited into the FOX Tokemak reactor.\n\nNO: No action is taken.",

      "title": "[SCP-52] Proposal to Establish and Fund the Growth and Globalization Workstream ",
      "content": "Summary\n\nThis proposal establishes and funds the Growth (Globalization, Partnerships, and Branding) workstream of which will focus on the strategizing, implementation, and optimization of growth campaigns/initiatives for the ShapeShift DAO. Establishing this workstream includes the designation of Toasty and Hunt as collaborative workstream leaders, while further establishing TheSmith and LPX as co-leaders of the globalization/translation initiative. The proposal will furthermore fund the inclusion of an additional 11 members: 5 current LatAM contributors, 3 globalization translators (Japanese, Korean, & French, with Chinese as a stretch goal in this four month term), and 3 contributors engaging in the development and deployment of the ShapeShift DAO Education project. \n\n\nAbstract\n\nToasty: Co-lead & manage the growth workstream and its strategies in outside partnerships and integrations. This includes overseeing and managing the public voice and branding of the DAO and it’s community presence, as well as leading internal integration strategies, DAO event coordination and cross-stream collaboration. It is an inherent responsibility of this role to function effectively as a leader in growth, branding, partnerships, event coordination, globalization, and information workstream/project efforts. \n\nHunt: Co-lead providing full support as-needed for the entirety of the workstreams directive both in strategizing and implementation of the growth and globalization’s workstream responsibilities and projects. This includes functioning effectively as a leader in growth, branding, partnerships, globalization, and information project efforts. \n\nTheSmith: Leader of LatAM Labs, and co-lead of globalization, TheSmith will focus on strategizing with hunt and toasty to develop and deploy branding and growth frameworks targeting Latin American demographics. \n\nLPX: Co-Leader of Globalization providing full support to document repository infrastructure hosted here: https://docs.shapeshift.one/. Furthermore, it is LPX’s responsibility to manage the development and execution of French, Japanese, and Chinese language (as a stretch goal) translation bounties.\n\n\nMotivation \n\nAs the DAO grows, the requirement for a branding and partnership focused growth initiative continues to grow as well. Providing assistance in Globalization and LatAM Labs development while focusing on its most successful projects/assets/contributors already in place provides newly-formed efficiency in strategizing human capital allocation. By combining the globalization workstream with a newly formed growth, partnership & event coordination workstream, the current workstream contributors in existing workflows will experience an ease of contribution not possible with the present lack of workstream structure and management surrounding the initiatives defined in this proposal.\n\nWhile FOX token reaches new and varied markets and the DAO continues to seek worldwide opportunities for partnerships and innovation, a dedicated team is required to better seek, acquire, and develop new branding and partnership opportunities as well as strengthening our current user knowledge base. The need for dedicated oversight and leadership to refine and strengthen growth opportunities is vital to the continued success of the DAO’s collective efforts. \n\nScope:\n\nBy establishing a dedicated workstream to focus on the growth, branding, partnerships, globalization, and information/project scope of DAO efforts, we resolve the need for the expansion team required to develop more partner integrations, drive an increase in globalization, and start a new DAO education sector. \n\nGoals/KPIs:\n\nDocument listing out goals and KPIs for the workstream. Also a monthly open meeting will be provided to the community to track and discuss current progress: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Mmt2_bjo8tVafzEqvrcBRE_XLSaF5zx4eXGRcjD_iqw/\n\nGrowth, Branding, Partnership, Globalization, and Information/Project scope of work to include:\n- Develop Twitter following and tone for marketing and outward facing messaging for the DAO, through posts/engagement, promotions, and integrations. This will be a joint effort with the Marketing Workstream. \n- Strategize and define direction in community growth efforts within discord and on forum.shapeshift.com\n- Planning and proposing event sponsorship and presence \n- Giveaways: Merch/NFT promotional giveaways\n- Contests: Content creation, Art auction\n- Provide Support/co-manage LatAM (Regular strategizing and optimization of ‘in progress’ campaigns within LatAM Labs & providing support for networking efforts including event sponsorships, integration inquiries, and partnership requests)\n- Cross-community relationship building/maintenance (ex: UMA x ShapeShift DAO & 1hive x ShapeShift DAO)\n- Closely align with product & engineering by regularly attending and engaging with the Engineering workstream in order to ensure that growth initiatives align with current engineering and product workstream vision\n- Develop ShapeShift DAO NFT Project Specs\n- Develop a branding voice guideline to cross collaborate with product while focusing on voice in social media, create a voice guide - Toasty\n\nPartnerships: \n- Recruits, develops, manages, motivates, and liaises with strategic partner alliances/partnerships and opportunity pipelines and integrations outside of the traditional crypto/ Defi space (NFTs, Blockchain gaming) via incoming and outgoing cross-community/project networking efforts while focusing on DAO to DAO opportunities that align with the vision, ethos, and mission of ShapeShift\n- Continue working with integration bounty hunters (also continue/maintain monstrosity’s current contract for successful integrations such as the ELK/FOX integration and marketing agreement deployed targeting XDAI liquidity offering opportunity)\n- Continue to form and maintain DAO to DAO relationships in order form strong, long-term cross-community relationships. \n- Collaborate with the DAO merch store partner to align with them on promotional/ event merchandise while building out the partnership scale.\n- Ensure coverage (deemed cost-effective by the DAO) at events to create/maintain new and promising/beneficial partnerships\n\nGlobalization: Globalization will be refined by Hunt and TheSmith as they also continue to focus on LatAM branding, growth, and marketing, while LPX continues focusing on translation repository development and Asia focused translation/onboarding. \n\nLatAM: Branding on social/web3 platforms while planning and proposing event sponsorship & presence at LatAM conferences/events (currently talking to and planning for bitconf and xyz conferences) to the DAO. Current planning documentation can be found here: https://nonstop-lilac-1fd.notion.site/BR-DAO-Events-Calendar-d889195ad86a40b2b3808c17769ebce9 \n\nOngoing efforts include:\n- LatAM Labs - Latin America focused marketing effort\nhttps://docs.shapeshift.one/ - A globalization/translation focused document repository \n- Content translation targeting Asia and Latin America \n- Information: Includes ShapeShift DAO Education Roadmap special project & bounty-based content creation. The ShapeShift DAO Education Project will directly address the lack of educational material to streamline onboarding and user-flow for new and interested DAO members, partners, and potential FOX hodlers.\n\nShapeShift DAO Education Roadmap: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1auDcM-W5XNNQ2dc_07e7boyML3Se13TqV5Po65gnexo/edit#slide=id.g1057f930c03_0_59\n\nSS DAO Education Project Goals: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1faCtDG3NUiO91BV86uALRXVmYQHjubINT4ayxktq464/\n\n\nSpecification\n\nThe term of this workstream and its contributors is 4 months from January 1st 2022 to May 1st 2022. This proposal both hires following contributors: Leadership (Toasty & Hunt), Global (LPX & FireBomb), LatAM (TheSmith, jpanam, mr bear, rohek, guilherme & vlad), and Information (ShapeShift DAO Education Project; @JessOtterlyHopeful, @DavidRAllen, @IrohDW), and funds the workstream and its projects with $249,000 USD in FOX.\n\nGrowth and Globalization Budget: \nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1v1eIjMCPTpog0ApGVb5M8xgg0jx2rNlejStpFA_LUpQ - All unused funds will be returned to the treasury.\n\nThe following link details Globalization accomplishments, blockers, and infrastructure overview and provides insight into the projected goals and roadmap of the workstream moving forward: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/15p7nTS3zBtGrVAHF3xt_9XP69k7FhIv59Qf0H-5STeQ/ \n\nDeveloping an effective globalization effort through engaging in Latin American focused marketing efforts enables the ShapeShift DAO to begin the process of brand establishment and growth initiatives in order to create a voice throughout Latin America for the ShapeShift brand. This initiative is invaluable as growth in adoption within the Latin American region has grown exponentially at a velocity that is currently unparalleled globally. Through engaging a demographic that ShapeShift has historically been unable to successfully market, the previously hindering barriers in serving LatAM demographics will be less significant. \n\nThe following links include the Latin American marketing roadmap, community notion, analytics, and project presentation slides:\n\nLatAM Presentation Slides Link: https://www.canva.com/design/DAEwIdJix1Q/4sIGciDNZ5-ve3zW_B3Tsg/view?website#2:latam-pmo-proposal\n\nLatAM Roadmap Link: https://nonstop-lilac-1fd.notion.site/Latam-Builders-12a98ced1c00491d8cf15895a7fef265\n\nLatAM Analytics Link: https://nonstop-lilac-1fd.notion.site/LatAm-KPI-s-bc32a1eb294a445da31260aac0cae0fa\n\nLatAM community notion: https://www.notion.so/ShapeShift-DAO-Latam-25eb72575d7e48a6bafff4994b2defcc\n\n\nBenefits\n\nThis proposal creates a single, unified workstream that works under/towards growth initiatives as defined in this proposal. Branding, globalization, and partnerships working together to create a unified approach in determining the best growth strategy will allow for an effective alignment in order to produce and maintain efficient growth-focused projects and partnerships.\n\n\nDrawbacks\n\nThis proposal will cost 249,000 USD in FOX across a four month period. This workstream merges previous work streams/project leadership, which may require optimization of existing strategy and implementation/optimization within the workstream and its projects (Globalization, LatAM labs, & ShapeShift DAO EDU Roadmap). \n\n",

      "title": "[SCP-49] Launch $oneFOX-$FOX Angel Vault",
      "content": "Summary - After discussions with the $FOX community during previous governance calls and tokenomics meetings, ICHI has been encouraged to submit a proposal to launch an ICHI $oneFOX-$FOX Angel Vault. This would allow the FOX DAO to build a treasury of DAO owned buy-side liquidity and protect the $FOX price during a market crash.\n\nAbstract - Liquidity is the money made available for trading. Most approaches to market making and liquidity involve putting up $FOX tokens and a base asset (usually ETH) for sale. This works great when $ETH is going up in value versus the dollar but leaves the $FOX price exposed to drops in the value of $ETH versus the dollar. Only single-sided $oneFOX is added to the proposed $oneFOX-$FOX Angel Vault. This protects $FOX price against market corrections.\n\nMotivation - $FOX price would be better protected against bear markets without hurting the upside during a bull market.\n\nSpecification - Angel Liquidity Vaults are a Uniswap v3 liquidity management protocol that allows LPs to deposit single-sided assets into a Uni v3 pool. They combine the rewarding and simple experience of Uniswap V2 with the concentrated liquidity of Uniswap V3. They enable projects to build a treasury of project owned liquidity and everyday DeFi users to earn fees without needing to manage their pool positions.\n\nClick here to read the Ideation thread: https://forum.shapeshift.com/t/scp-49-launch-onefox-fox-angel-vault-official-ideation-thread/905\n\nLiquidity may be added to the Angel Vault in the following ways:\n\n1. Direct deposits by the $FOX community treasury,\n2. Incentivizing deposits by LPs,\n3. Purchasing LP with programs such as Olympus Pro Bonds, and/or\n4. Leveraging the assets backing $oneFOX to mint more $oneFOX and deposit it to the Angel Vault.\n\nThis liquidity should total a minimum of $2M $oneFOX to enable profitable rebalancing of the Angel Vault. $10M or more liquidity is recommended given FOX’s large Uni V2 FOX-WETH pool. While several options are available, we propose the following to secure the initial liquidity:\n\n1. ShapeShift DAO mints $2,000,000 oneFOX (method of minting can be determined by TM&D committee, but may include acquiring stablecoins via Success Token sales, borrowing against FOX, leveraging existing stablecoin balances in the treasury, or potentially other means as long as they do not result in FOX sell pressure)\n2. Launch an Angel Vault farming program targeting $8M of additional liquidity for 6 months and a >50% APR including trading fees. Assuming an average APR from trading fees of ~35% (based on the results from the oneUNI/ICHI angel vault), a conservative reward rate of 25% should be targeted. At current FOX price of ~$0.65, this translates to $1M of FOX rewards, or 1,538,461 FOX rewarded over a 6 month period.\n\nBenefits - ICHI’s Angel Vaults are the easiest and most cost effective way for projects to increase their liquidity floor, enabling:\n\n1. LPs to earn more trading fees with less,\n2. Liquidity rewards to increase the amount of buy side liquidity without also incentivizing sell pressure,\n3. The inflationary cost of rewards to be offset by the deflationary minting of the project’s branded dollar, and\n4. DAOs to build assets under management (AUM) backing their branded dollar and supplying DAO owned liquidity.\n\nDrawbacks - If $FOX price declines in value, $oneFOX will be sold for $FOX. LPs will only be holding worthless $FOX tokens if $FOX price goes to $0.",

      "title": "Create an “Alpha” version of the open-source ShapeShift web app with Analytics",
      "content": "Summary:\n\nThis is a proposal to create an “Alpha” version of the open-source ShapeShift web app with Analytics.\n\nThe Alpha version will be an “opt-in” first look experimental version of ShapeShift where features will be launched in their infancy for testing and feedback from the community. This version will have analytics and guided user journeys, A/B testing, heatmaps and more (via Pendo), so that the product team can discover pain points, validate assumptions, and gather feedback to improve the experience, before releasing changes to the Private version. This will be a truly opt-in Alpha version, that users will agree to participate in upon entering. No PII data will ever be tracked, in fact, part of the agreement with Pendo is that we are not allowed to track any PII, and if we do they can terminate our account.\n\nThe Private version will have no analytics or user tracking of any sort and will contain features that have already been tested and analyzed in the Alpha version.\n\nMotivation:\n\nAfter a lot of feedback from the community about Analytics in the DAO, a new idea was born. As the Product Workstream, our goal is to make the best user experience possible and create the best products for the success of the DAO! As part of our process we rely on analytics & data to track feature adoption, inform new features or feature updates through data-driven decisions, understand areas of product friction and ensure tight product-market fit. The data helps us answer questions like where are our users navigating? What are/aren’t they adopting? Are the users starting a journey and then abandoning at a specific point? What are the points of friction? Does the user have a clear path if something goes wrong?\n\nAnd more. Therefore, we think that this early, first look Alpha version is critical to our success.\n\nWe also feel that by having two versions that are clearly labeled for the users, and the Alpha version being a true “opt-in” experience, there would be no confusion at the user level as to the differences between them.\n\nIn centralized ShapeShift, we used a combination of analytical tools to track user data, create user segments, monitor funnels and more. In the DAO, it would save us costs and effort to implement one all-powerful tool like Pendo in the Alpha version. This also makes it more useful for our DAO structure (any team will be able to grab/review data without dependencies on another team). Furthermore, Pendo will give us the ability to create user onboarding journeys, guided feature walk-thrus, a comprehensive user resource section, A/B testing, heatmaps and more—all without any engineering lift.\n\nSpecification\nAlpha & Private Versions\n\nThe Alpha version will simply be a step in the CI/CD pipeline, almost like a staging environment. Once features have been launched, tested, updated and bugs eliminated, it will be pushed to the Private version.\n\nInstallation\n\nTo install Pendo, it’s a snippet of code added to the website.\n\nMaintenance\n\nThe user guides, resource center and tooltip walk-thrus will be created and maintained by the Product Workstream. We also will save considerable development/engineering time, as we won’t be dependent on engineers to develop, update, or analyze these.\n\nReviewing Data\n\nAnalytics will be easily accessible by all workstreams in the DAO, and as a Product Workstream, we’ll share progress and review analytics with the community.\n\nBudget\n\nPendo is an all-in-one tool that will save us money as we won’t have to implement multiple tools to give us the same benefits. The annual cost for integrating it into the Alpha web app is\n\n$36,520.00 annually + $3,400 QuickStart (this will help us get up and running with the guides quickly) and will be paid to Pendo in FOX Tokens!\n\nBenefits\n\nThe Alpha version will give us the analytics and user input we need to make the product awesome before pushing it to the Private version.\n\nBy using Pendo, we’ll have an all-in-one platform for tracking, analyzing, and creating guided user journeys (instead of paying for multiple platforms). We expect the initial setup to take several weeks to get all the guides and the resource center up and running. As mentioned above, all of that will be handled as part of the Product Workstream responsibilities. It will not require engineering efforts.\n\nRetention is an important metric, and one that can be improved by utilizing this approach. We’ll be able to take our user experience to the next level, guiding and engaging our users at the right moments, leading to better feature engagement and higher user retention. Without the metrics we would have an extremely difficult time determining where to improve the UX and measuring the success of our product. New feature adoption rates will also be evaluated as a metric to measure success.\n\nDrawbacks\n\nPendo is not the cheapest solution out there. But, it’s an all-inclusive solution where we feel the benefits outweigh the cost (especially if compared to pricing out several different tools that collectively would provide the same benefits). We’d also be committing to an annual plan to get the best pricing.\n\nNote: MrNerdHair is currently reviewing the Pendo code. If this proposals passes, we will make certain that the Security Workstream signs off on Pendo from a security perspective before implementation on Alpha.\n\nVote\n\nIf you vote “for” this proposal you are voting to create an ALPHA and PRIVATE version of the new ShapeShift web app. Alpha will contain analytics tool Pendo.\n\nIf you vote “against” this proposal, you do not think this is the correct approach for the DAO or that you think there might be a better solution",

      "content": "    Summary\nThis proposal integrates Coordinape into ShapeShift. Its implementation will be determined by each workstream leader.\n\n  Abstract \n[Coordinape](https://coordinape.com/) is a bottom up payment system in which people are paid based on how their team feels about their contributions.\n\nEach payment period has a budget and a team of contributors. At the end of the payment period (usually monthly) the contributors have a set amount of GIVE tokens that they give to the team members they believe deserve it the most. Give tokens that are received are exchanged for a corresponding amount of the budget. A simple example would be a contributor with 10% of the total GIVE tokens and 10,000 FOX in the budget, then at the end of the payment period they receive 1000 FOX. Coordinape records and aggregates who is giving to who and what they are working on, which provides a lot of information that can be used to make the DAO more efficient.\n\n\n    Motivation\nWith the creation of DAOs, there is no limit to the freedom we have in how we incentivize contributors. One gap we have in our current system is that payment is routed through workstream leaders, which is top down. Adding a bottom up payment system in addition to the current one gives us more flexibility in how we organize ourselves to get tasks done. While Coordinape may not be ideal for all workstreams, having it as an option will certainly benefit the DAO as a whole.\n\n\n    Specification\nTo get workstreams started using this without constraining their budgets immediately, I request 100K FOX to create a Coordinape fund that will be divided relative to the budget size of each workstreams. E.g. if a workstream's budget is 10% of all workstreams, then they get 10% of this fund.\n\n\n    Benefits\nProvides a bottom up way to pay contributors\n\nThe community gets a lot of information about what contributors are doing and the value they bring the DAO.\n\n    Drawbacks\nRequires some time and energy to set up and adds additional complexity to our payment systems. \n\nCoordinape is paid by donations, so whatever we agree to give them is a cost on our treasury.\n\n\n    Compensation\nIf this proposal passes, I request 2000 FOX for setting it up. \n\n\n    Vote\nFor: \n1. Shapeshift officially supports Coordinape\n2. 100K FOX fund is made to help get is started.\n3. I get compensated 2000 FOX if the proposal passes.\n\nAgainst: nothing changes.\n",

      "title": "Proposal to fund the Product & Creative Services Workstream, Jan-June 30 2022",
      "content": "Abstract\n\nAs a product-centric DAO, a well-resourced Product & Creative Services Workstream is vital to our success. The Workstream is accountable for a number of activities which are critical to the DAO’s ability to delight users, grow the FOX ecosystem, and achieve its mission. This is a proposal to continue funding the Product & Creative Services Workstream’s anticipated budget through June 30, 2022.\n\nMotivation\n\nContinuing to fund this workstream will ensure that the ShapeShift DAO can retain the extraordinary talent that the Workstream already has while also ensuring the team can expand and fulfill the growing product, design and UX needs that the DAO’s product development and creative requirements demand. The workstream has so far succeeded in hitting their goals, and has completed a large number of projects including the launch of the new responsive Alpha website and successful Yearn integration. We’re also working on an updated proposal to implement analytics on an Alpha version of the web app (alpha.shapeshift.com) where new features will be released first. This will enable us to collect and report metrics to the community while still offering a private, analytics-free version of the app on app.shapeshift.com 1. View completed items on our roadmap https://shapeshift.notion.site/68196f67e07943ed8bb1e10ac7d1430d?v=024c941b800e48d580630470d282e3dd\n(completed items are moved to the bottom) and on our UX/Design board https://shapeshift.notion.site/b678768a68e847e2b174e170feffc5e8?v=302c03bbced048bc911929052b4d3a70\n(completed items are in the completed column).\n\nSpecification\n\nMission: Design and execute the optimal product roadmap for achieving the mission and goals of the ShapeShift DAO. And now, with the addition of the Creative Services group (voted on and approved 1 by the community) to also provide design-oriented and brand-focused creative support, guidelines, and guardrails to the myriad of projects the DAO will take on.\n\nHigh Level Goals\n\nCurate and propose a product roadmap based on research, user feedback and behavior, and informed vision that aligns with the mission and goals of the ShapeShift DAO.\n\nProvide feature specifications (including goals and success metrics), UI/UX designs, product management, and applicable front-end development for features prioritized by the ShapeShift DAO.\n\nRepresent the ShapeShift DAO’s product suite, roadmap, and workstream and act as a repository of knowledge.\n\nEnsure the delivery of prioritized features on time, on or under budget, and according to the acceptance criteria defined in each feature spec written by the Product Managers.\n\nAssist with one-off community projects as needed, and make sure all projects executed by the workstream and outside the workstream are on brand and pass usability.\n\nHelp all ShapeShift DAO Workstreams communicate effectively, by creating engaging content that is aligned with the brand of ShapeShift DAO.\n\nCommunicate ideas, create materials to educate FOX holders, assist in the creative needs to help launch marketing campaigns and expand the effectiveness of the brand.\n\nSpecific Goals\n\nIn addition to the higher level goals, we’ve outlined some more specific goals for the Product Workstream. We’d also like to make sure we remain agile—understanding that new partnerships or new revenue generating Defi projects could be brought forward, and some of those could shift our current goals or bring new goals forward. We will relay progress of these back to the community in our Product Office hours.\n\n•Get the specs completed and the UX/UI done and usability tested for web 2.0\n\n1 sided-LPing\n2 sided-LPing\nmulti-sided LPing\n• Get the Specs and UX/UI ready and usability tested for Display Defi Positions across multiple protocols\n\n• Get Onjuno and Gem launched on Web V2\n\n• Get ALPHA launched with Analytics and report back to the community on a monthly basis\n\n• Get Specs and UX/UI ready and usability tested to do a direct Tokemak integration into Web v2\n\n• Mobile application solution determined and aligned upon, and prepared from a product/UX/UI perspective\n\n• Evolve the product roadmap and make sure as new potential integrations or partner/ revenue ideas are considered and reported back to the community for discussion (in Office Hours)\n\n• Collaborate with Engineering workstream to align on wallet strategy and complete the specs and UX/UI coming out of that\n\n• Collaborate with Engineering workstream to align on the strategy and launch of the private web 2.0 version\n\n• Continue to execute and optimize and finesse the Web 2.0 UI in a regular design QA session\n\n• Support other departments as needed from a design/UI perspective — everything from Illustrations to blogs, etc\n\n• Continue with user interviews to collect regular feedback and help with persona perspective\n\n.com redo the global nav and identify and build out new pages we’lll need in order to better align with our new products and the fact we’re a DAO\n\n• Collaborate with Marketing & Growth to successfully align on project and product releases.\n\nSuccess Metrics\n\nDefine and propose an evolving roadmap that aligns with the vision of the DAO and is discussed with and accepted by the community\nFeatures on the roadmap and goals outlined are delivered in milestones, on or under budget, and according to the acceptance criteria defined in each feature spec.\nThe KPIs specified in each feature spec are tracked and reported to the community (once Analytics are implemented into Alpha).\nExecute projects that lead to growth in DAO revenues.\nOwn and evolve the brand and ensure a polished, professional image in all that we DAO.\nBudget\n\nTotal Funds Requested For 6 months: $686,049*\n\n*This covers salaries, software, test funds, etc. All unused funds will be returned to the treasury.\n\nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10NM9yP8U_014UaPTMj9xQygjjhmfSav6cd5jdzmPRHU/edit?usp=sharing\n\nThe budget has been revised from the previous budget, as the needs from the Workstream have evolved in the past several months. We have removed the Project Manager roles, as it currently stands, they are not immediately necessary. Should the need arise to add those or additional roles in the future, separate proposals will be made accordingly.\n\nAlso, it is worth noting that Diggy was voted into the Workstream leadership role, through Feb 2022. If she plans to run for the Workstream leader position beyond that timeframe, she will make a separate proposal later on.\n\nIf this proposal passes, most of this budget will be distributed in stable coin going forward. The equivalent amount of USDC & a small portion in FOX will be transferred from the DAO’s treasury to the Product Workstream on Colony on a monthly basis. (Because FOX is a volatile asset, any decreases in FOX price will warrant additional transfers of FOX from the DAO to the Product Workstream on Colony to ensure the Workstream has enough FOX to cover its budget). All unused funds will be returned to the DAO.\n\nBenefits\n\nIf this proposal passes, the DAO will receive the following specific deliverables and services which are integral to its success:\n\n• Proposed feature roadmap encompassing the following products the DAO: ShapeShift Mobile, current web app (beta.shapeshift.com), new open-source web app, shapeshift.com, and other products the ShapeShift DAO launches\n\n• Feature specs for prioritized features including goals, success metrics, and acceptance criteria\n\n• UI/UX for each prioritized feature\n\n• Front-end development\n\n• Reporting on product KPIs and feature success metrics (once Analytics are in place)\n\n• Design-oriented and brand-focused creative support, guidelines, and guardrails to the myriad of projects the DAO will take on\n\nDrawbacks\n\nThe main potential risk is whether cost/benefit of a product workstream will be worth it to the DAO’s bottom-line in the long term. To mitigate this risk, only 6 months of funding are being requested. The funds will be managed on Colony and can be revoked by the DAO in a worst-case-scenario.\n\nVote\n\nFOR: You support funding the workstream’s anticipated 2022 budget for 6 months totaling $686,049\n\nAGAINST: You do not support continuing to fund the product workstream",

      "content": "\n**Objective**\n\nThe Shapeshift DAO needs to be empowered to run its own software infrastructure independent of legacy, centralized Shapeshift or any duly appointed custodians thereof. The goal of this proposal is to enumerate the reasons why, and the resources required to make it a reality.\n\n**Abstract**\n\nCurrently, the Shapeshift DAO depends on infrastructure provided by Shapeshift AG in order to bootstrap hardware for its next-generation defi software platform to operate. If the DAO is to become independent and self-sufficient, it will need to appoint one or more trusted proxies to operate its own infrastructure. Shapeshift AG is dissolving, and if a new arrangement is not made, the DAO will eventually have no assets on which to run its platform or development environments. As the primary function of the DAO is to produce a software product, this initiative is integral for the long-term ability of the DAO to function and survive at a very basic level.\n\n**Specification**\n\nWe are proposing that the Shapeshift DAO enables itself to independently serve its own product to the world via leveraging its existing relationship with TaxiStake. TaxiStake is a legal US commercial entity already tooled for operating in this capacity, and currently runs a Cosmos Validator on behalf of the DAO. As such, there are no initial capital expenditures required to fund the project.\n\nThe DAO’s next-gen defi platform, referred to as “Shapeshift Web v2”, pulls its data from a piece of back-end software, named “Unchained”. Unchained initially pivots on offering a rich user experience with the Ethereum ecosystem via the Geth blockchain client running in full archive mode. This means that the Geth implementation is demanding in both storage and run-time resources. As a result, the initial footprint of a new Unchained cluster running Ethereum is about $1000 USD a month. Thankfully, this initial cluster footprint will also be powerful enough to run a few additional, less-demanding blockchain clients such as Bitcoin, Litecoin, and Thorchain, without incurring additional cost to the operator.\n\nThis proposal posits that:\n\n* TaxiStake will provision an isolated, dedicated cloud provider account for running the DAO’s infrastructure. No services will be provisioned in this account that do not belong to the DAO.\n* TaxiStake itself will not be responsible for on-call or triage of operational issues with the software.\n* TaxiStake will delegate privileged access to the cluster and/or account for appropriate members of the Engineering Workstream who are responsible for on-call and triage of operational issues.\n* TaxiStake will provide programmatic access to the account in order to deploy assets via automated CI/CD workflows.\n* The instance of Unchained operated by TaxiStake will become the primary back-end leveraged by Shapeshift Web v2.\n* A Sablier stream will be established, from which TaxiStake can be reimbursed at a 150% rate for monthly operational expenditures incurred in running this infrastructure for three months. This equates to about $500 USD a month in profit for TaxiStake itself. If this arrangement needs to be terminated or modified for any reason, the DAO can simply withdraw or reissue the stream’s contract. This arrangement will be renewed on a quarterly basis unless otherwise modified by governance.\nThe relationship with TaxiStake will continue to be leveraged for future infrastructure needs, assuming all goes well. At present, this is expected to include future blockchain integrations in the Unchained back-end, but could be extended to new feature offerings.\n\n**Motivation/Benefits**\n\nAs mentioned previously, the DAO currently depends on Shapeshift AG to provide hardware to run its software product. The primary motivation of this proposal is to enable the DAO to serve its own product to the world with its own infrastructure.\n\n**Drawbacks**\n\nIt does increase the DAO’s reliance on the relationship with TaxiStake. However, the infrastructure deployment workflow is currently packaged in such a way that if the relationship with TaxiStake needs to be terminated for some reason, it is a fairly simple process to deploy these assets elsewhere under the auspices of a new arrangement.\n\nAdditionally, the Foundation will be running an Unchained endpoint for the foreseeable future, and Shapeshift Web v2 can be quickly reconfigured to use it within a matter of minutes should need arise.\n\n**Vote**\n\nIf you vote “For” this proposal, you are endorsing the following points:\n\n* The DAO should be capable of running its own infrastructure to serve its own product,\n* TaxiStake is a trusted proxy able to run the DAO’s infrastructure in a reliable and secure fashion,\n* The establishment and funding of a Sablier contract in the amount of $4500 USD in DAI stablecoin tokens (1 DAI = 1 USD) to serve as a reimbursement vector for TaxiStake’s operational expenditures over the course of three months.\n\nIf you vote “Against”, you are indicating that you do not want the DAO to be able to run its own infrastructure, or perhaps just not via the existing relationship with TaxiStake.",

      "title": "[SCP-42] TOKEMAK C.o.R.E. 2 Reactor Bribe Refund",
      "content": "Summary: This proposal provides TOKEMAK C.o.R.E. 2 Reactor bribe refunds to the FOX holders that secured the #1 position on the recent C.o.R.E 2 reactor vote through selflessly making bribe donations on behalf of the DAO. These C.o.R.E. 2 Reactor bribes provided incentivization for TOKE voters to decide which project/coin would secure a reactor. Without said bribes FOX would very likely not have secured/won a reactor (requiring top 5) during the C.o.R.E. 2 vote.\n\nAbstract: During the voting process, FOX token did not seem to be in a position to win with the level of incentivization provided by the community leading into the final day/hours of the vote (as can be seen in this thread where we were #8 with 15 hours to go: https://forum.shapeshift.com/t/tokemak-c-o-r-e-2-solution). The only idea/solution that the community could agree upon at the time within the ShapeShift DAO discord, was that we would all support a future vote to refund FOX bribers; if we were to plea to the community/FOX holders. Thankfully after I made this post in an attempt to rally the community, numerous FOX holders stepped up to the plate in the interest of the DAO, selflessly increasing the amount of FOX in our C.o.R.E. 2 bribe pool.\n\nMotivation: The benefits of having a TOKEMAK reactor are vast and provide the DAO with not only new tokenomics related capability, but in community growth, exposure to new potential users, and so much more. What the community members did that stepped up to the plate and secured this C.o.R.E. 2 reactor is effectively heroic in my opinion, and for the aforementioned reasons I am dedicated to following up on the suggestion that we refund these heros.\n\nSpecification: This proposal passing provides a refund in the amount of 1295964.93 FOX, which will be paid out to 9 addresses (from 14 transactions). The addresses collected were provided by @CollFoxyPrincess (on discord) to myself @huntthewick (@hunt on discord). They have also been fact-checked by myself (@huntthewick), @collfoxyprincess, and @jonisjon. Furthermore, these payments are to be directed and executed by the Treasury’s multi-sig signers if this proposal is to pass.\n\nBenefits: We have secured a highly sought after TOKEMAK reactor due to the selfless and honorable acts of numerous FOX holders/community members. This refund provides them assurance that this community will do the right thing in providing a refund to holders that wish to see our DAO grow in strength and capability; two things that a TOKEMAK reactor will bring to FOX token & our DAO as a whole.\n\nDrawbacks: We will be distributing 1295964.93 FOX from the treasury; this is an expense which decreases total treasury holdings.",

      "title": "[SCP-38] Formation of the Creative Services Group within the Product Workstream",
      "content": "SUMMARY:\nThis proposal details the formation of the Creative Services Group as a subgroup within the Product Workstream. The purpose of the Creative Services Group is to make creative content in alignment with the ShapeShift brand.\n\nABSTRACT:\nThis group is proposed to be a new squad within the Product Workstream, resulting in a slight expansion of the responsibilities handled by Products to encompass design services for other workstreams. My proposed role is to be Director of Creative Services, as a new full-time member of the Product Workstream, and squad leader of Creative Services Group.\n\nMOTIVATION:\nCompanies in the crypto space are highly brand-focused: SushiSwap, Olympus, Maker DAO, etc. Sustaining ShapeShift’s strong aesthetic and branding guideline is essential in pushing forward as an industry leader.\n\nThe mission of Creative Services is to provide design-oriented and brand-focused creative support, guidelines, and guardrails to the myriad of projects the DAO will take on. This includes internal projects from workstream members, bountied designers, and content creators from the community.\n\nSPECIFICATIONS:\nThe focus of this squad is to help all ShapeShift workstreams communicate effectively, supported by engaging content that is aligned with the brand of ShapeShift DAO. This support can come in the form of:\n\nProduct marketing management\nProduct launch process management\nGraphic design services\n2D/3D animation\nGIF / Sticker creation for Discord / GIPHY / Tenor\nVideo production\nCreative writing\nProducer services:\nStory visualization\nScript services\nVideo translation production\nClosed / Open Captioning\nTalent coordination and management\nInstructional design\nCreative project management\nNFT creation & sales\n\nIt is anticipated that the production needs will be handled by myself for these first 6 months, and by bounties when additional production support is needed. I will serve as a project manager and designer, also function as a group manager to coordinate and curate design talent for future projects, as we look toward expansion.\n\nHoff remains the ShapeShift brand director and Diggy will continue to serve as the Director of the Product Workstream, to whom the Creative Services Group will report.\n\nBENEFITS\nAn all-encompassing design group allows ShapeShift to be competitive within the crypto ecosystem, projecting a polished, professional image in all that we DAO. Every product we make should have a compelling story and visual identity that resonates with the community.\n\nAs a part of Product Workstream, we can provide product launch services to effectively inform and delight customers as new products come to fruition. As we move further into decentralization and open-source, the community will continue to drive so much more of our future. It is imperative to take charge of our image, establishing boundaries for new designers that want to be ShapeShift DAO contributors.\n\nA Creative Services Group allows me to do what I’ve been doing for the last few months: design, animation, video, and much more. However, I get to do this unfettered from the burden of holding two jobs simultaneously, or without having to budget bounties for every small job.\n\nBUDGET\nNOTE: This proposal is for a “vote of confidence” in launching the group in 2022, and for the creation of the role. The budget will be approved with the renewal of the Product Workstream.\n\nThe budget for this squad will add $122,000 to the Product & Design Workstream over the next 6 months, covering some initial equipment costs, salary, utilities, stock elements, and additional expenses such as bountied design services, trade shows/conferences, and benefits. I anticipate the first two months being a phase-out of my previous job, overlapping one full month and a perhaps second month of contracting with my previous employer. Details will be disclosed in the Product and Design Workstream proposal.\n\nNon-salary items that go unused (stock elements, bounties, conferences) will go back to the DAO.\n\nDRAWBACKS\nThe only drawback I see is cost. I think we have some opportunity to offset with revenue-positive projects such as YAT integration, OpenSea integration, NFT creation, and possibly even creative production services for other DAOs.\n\nVOTE:\nA vote “Yes” means: you support the creation of the Creative Services group within the Product workstream, and approve me (@Graymachine) to be the Creative Services Director.\n\nA vote of “No” means to reject the Create Services group and the full-time role of Creative Services Director.\n",

      "title": "[SCP-40] Create & Fund a Tokenomics Workstream",
      "content": "SUMMARY:\n\nThis proposal relates to the creation of a ShapeShift DAO Workstream dedicated to tokenomics. The workstream would focus on a broad range of issues related to treasury management and FOX value-accrual (as outlined and scoped below). Also defined are the workstream’s initial structure, budget, and success metrics.\n\nThis proposal, if passed, would also install a Workstream Leader and set aside funding through March 31st, 2022. This initial phase will allow the community to assess whether the workstream’s activities, leadership, and budgetary outlays are a net positive for the DAO.\n\nABSTRACT:\n\nCurrently ShapeShift has an ad hoc workstream focused on tokenomics, with vibrant discussions already taking place–primarily around treasury management questions. These discussions are already bearing fruit (for instance, around the creation of a treasury management committee), but could benefit from additional structure and strategic direction.\n\nFollowing community approval of this proposal, a tokenomics Workstream would be created, existing alongside other workstreams in ShapeShift’s org chart. The workstream’s leader would be Kent, this proposal’s author. The tokenomics leader would be tasked with bringing clarity to the current ambiguous structure and strategy, as well as providing guidance and direction to other community members operating in the workstream.\n\nMOTIVATION:\n\nTokenomics is the lifeblood of most successful DAO’s. When a DAO has its own token (a governance token, in the case of ShapeShift), it unlocks a host of exciting possibilities, including:\n\nFunding for the DAO via its treasury\nSustainable business models that were previously not possible\nValue-accrual mechanisms for holders of the token, of which a subset are users of the ShapeShift platform\nClearly defining the Tokenomics Workstream and a cohesive strategy will enable the ShapeShift DAO and FOX Token to achieve its greatest potential. The current workstream, operating as a placeholder until something official could be built out, has already made great strides in terms of a.) engaging community members and b.) contributing to discussions and decision-making around topics such as treasury management and engagement with novel DeFi protocols.\n\nIn light of the progress that’s already been achieved without a fully-funded and clearly-defined Tokenomics Workstream, it’s easy to imagine how much could be accomplished once these elements are in place. Equally important, a workstream budget would incentivize more community members to spend their time, effort, and brainpower on these issues. Additionally, these economic incentives might also bring invaluable new talent to the DAO.\n\nSPECIFICATIONS:\n\nThe Tokenomics Workstream will focus on two broad questions:\n\nHow should the DAO manage its treasury?\nHow will value accrue to FOX and holders of the token?\nWhat are the core responsibilities of the Tokenomics Workstream Leader?\n\n1.) Define the strategic goals of the Workstream.\n\n2.) Build a team of contributors who can help make those goals a reality.\n\n3.) Work alongside that team as the Workstream devises and employs the tactics necessary to achieve its goals.\n\n4.) Revisit and revise the strategic direction as necessary.\n\nWhat constitutes success?\n\nFor this first four-mouth term, initial deliverables will include:\n\n1.) Creating a “State of the FOX” snapshot that provides an updated view of our treasury, current partnerships, and value-accrual strategies. With a clear picture of where we are now, we’ll be better-positioned to execute on our strategic objectives.\n\n2.) Creating strategic treasury management diversification goals, for consideration by the Treasury Management Committee.\n\n3.) Diversification of the treasury (pending Committee approval).\n\n4.) Building a team of tokenomics contributors.\n\n5.) Contributing to the creation of new value-accrual mechanisms for FOX.\n\nVoting \"YES\" does the following: \n\n 1.) Create the Tokenomics Workstream as described above. 2.) Install Kent as the Workstream Leader. 3.) Fund the Tokenomics Workstream with $95,500 through March 31st, 2022.",

      "title": "[SCP #39]Proposal to Create Community Moderation Workstream as an independent workstream",
      "content": "Summary\n\nWhy should people use this workstream? What is it for?\n\nThe Community Moderation Workstream will be primarily responsible to support the community and to maintain the integrity of all ShapeShift various platforms such as Discord, The Forum, Boardroom and Notion. Future platforms that the community chooses to implement may also be included. This workstream is used daily to ensure the smooth operation of the ShapeShift DAO.\n\nThis proposal is to establish the Moderation Workstream, elect Giantkin as leader and fund the workstream through June 2022.\n\nAbstract\n\nHow exactly is this different than the other categories we already have?\n\nModeration supports all workstreams and all users within each of the platforms it moderates. The first community moderators, Giantkin and Hunt, were hired by FOX Token holders for 4 months, but a workstream was not established. After over 3 months of service and learnings, it’s clear that the need for community moderation is growing and it makes sense to operate as a Workstream rather than a “Special Project.”\n\nAs we bring more members into the various platforms, moderators will act as so much more than bot managers and spam blockers. Not only will the moderators set up the verification process, they will be the point of contact for members having issues with the verification process. They will function as the greeters of the DAO, if you will. Our team of moderators will be clearing the path for new members, new contributors and new supporters by facilitating a fluid user experience. Enthusiastic about all things defi and crypto, empowering community members, new and old alike, on their journey to self-empowered entrepreneurism.\n\nMotivation\n\nWhat is the mission of this workstream?\n\nThe mission of this workstream is simple: to help people. Moderation is the workstream you never knew you needed, but couldn’t live without. From welcoming new users to setting up Zoom calls to managing bots. Moderation is here to support the community. This workstream strives to create a space that fosters security, growth and innovation.\n\nA team of trustworthy, confident and enthusiastic moderators will allow for decentralization of community moderation. This may address the point of preventing accusations of vested interest, since only community elected mods have the power to preserve and maintain the DAO culture.\n\nAs the workstream leader, I want to make the user feel like they are able to relax. Users are most likely talking from their home space, home usually means they feel safe. I want to keep that feeling in our group\n\nSpecification\n\nModerators will take on wide variety of tasks, including but not limited to:\n\nOrganize user flow via roles, channels and bots\nProvide protection from scammers\nWarn abusers (strike system established by Giantkin)\nProviding Discord support\nFacilitating ‘temps’ for a job, for example, providing the DJ with a role for the event\nMaintain and update server images such as avatars, stickers, emojis, etc.\nProvide moderation support (live when possible) for meetings and community events\nDrive users to the proper channels\nContinually monitoring channels, and other server banlists for potential spam/scammers and adding them into our banlist\nTaking part in Ops triage process by shuttling members requesting support to the proper channels, connecting with self help resources, #support, Zendesk, etc as appropriate\nAppropriate use of Admin Switch by Community Moderation Workstream Leader\nWhat are the goals of this workstream? What metrics can this workstream’s success be measured against?\n\nProvide 12 hour moderation coverage to ShapeShift DAO’s community channels, with the eventual goal to provide 24 hour coverage\nProactively ban 90% of scammers/bots that try to sneak into ShapeShift discord\nEnsure that all community meetings are scheduled on the calendar\nThe Moderation Workstream is successful when you don’t notice that it’s there.\n\nWill your workstream hold recurring meetings?\n\nThis workstream will be in regular communication, as facilitating smooth communication is one of the main jobs. Moderators will be available and accessible as frequently as possible. Regular office hours will not be needed as moderators are almost always watching.\n\nDoes this workstream require immediate funding?\n\nYes. Funding for current proposal ends 11.30.21.\n\nBudget\n$USD\nSee Ideation Post for some extra details on budget.\n\nNumbers Represented in $USD\nModeration Budget:\n   Salaries:\n       Workstream Leader   $5,000/month    Total until end of June $35,000\n       Community Moderator $3,000/month - Total until end of June $21,000\n   Discretionary Funds  $3,700 Month 1, $3200 Month 2, and $2500/month thereafter.   Total until end of June $19,400\n\nTotals:  Month 1 $11,700, Month 2 $11,200, and Month 3+ $10,500 Total until end of June $75,400",

      "content": "Summary - The current Zendesk Help Desk landing page is in need of a redesign. I’m requesting $3000 in FOX to be paid out to the web designer who is up for the task. Customizing/editing the website requires being proficient in CSS/JS. We estimate this could take about 1-2 weeks of work. We would like to reserve time to make 1-2 rounds of edits before making it live.\n\nAbstract - The current help desk theme was last updated in July of 2019. With ShapeShift transitioning to a DAO and in the spirit of embracing change, it’s time to update our look, mainly to improve the user experience. Along with the visuals changing, the URL will also be switched from shapeshift.zendesk.com to support.shapeshift.com or shapeshift.com/help.\n\nMotivation - Our help desk articles receive 7k views every week (6 month average). It’s important that it looks professional, beautiful, and is easy to navigate.\n\nSpecification - The designer will be given Zendesk login credentials which allows for editing to be done via Zendesk’s workbench. We are able to preview new themes before making the changes live. Here is Zendesk’s resource on customizing themes: (Customizing your help center theme – Zendesk help ). I’m estimating this will take a web designer 5 days (one work week) to complete which is equal to $600 per day (in FOX).\n\nBenefits - ShapeShift has strong branding and great product marketing. Updating the look/feel of our helpdesk will help us stay on par with having beautiful designs.\n\nLink to forum post that includes some screenshots: https://forum.shapeshift.com/t/scp-37-redesign-of-the-shapeshift-help-desk/756\n\nVote:\nYes - $3000 in FOX be paid out to redesign the ShapeShift Help Desk page.\nNo - Deny the funding and redesign.\n",

The committee will be a dedicated team of members carefully watching, acting and reporting on a weekly basis.\n\nThe proposed committee members selected by poll by the community are:\nDanielle, Amicus.eth / Rotorless, albitrage / Al, profMcC, seven7hwave/ Kent\n\nThe amount of 60,000,000 FOX is proposed to be available to the committee to implore strategies as they see fit. Examples: collateralization/ debt, liquidity provision, yield farming, and other defi strategies.\n\nMotivation:\nTo be able to act quickly, manage and execute on treasury management and diversification strategies to allow for a more active, holistic and long-term approach to treasury management.\n\nSpecifications:\nEstablish a TMDC under the Tokenomics Workstream.\nCommittee would consist of 5 qualified community members. \nThe committee would be governed by a simple majority rule. The committee requires 4 members for quorum when voting.\nThe committee meetings will be open to the ShapeShift DAO community but only the 5 members will vote.\nThis proposal would be an initial test of the committee\nTrial basis for 3 months. November 18th, 2021 - February 16, 2022\nThere is no compensation for these roles for the trial basis.\nA subsequent proposal is required for the committee to continue on\nDuring the trial basis the committee will not have any direct access to the DAO treasury, there will be a check and balance in place with the current trusted signers of the DAO.\nIf a majority of the committee vote to approve the X, then this committee will work with the trusted signers of the DAO to execute the trade, project etc.\n\nGovernance of the committee:\nThe ShapeShift DAO can vote to replace the committee or remove their power at any time.\nThe DAO can vote to replace any single member on the committee at any time.\nIf a member of the committee quits their duties before the end of the trial period, a new committee member must be elected by community vote.\n\nState of the Treasury (11/2/21):\nRestricted Treasury via Sablier Stream\n242 million FOX was initially granted\n221,000 FOX per day is available to claim\nWithdrawn 25 million FOX so far\n242,000,000 - 24,000,000 = 218,000,000 FOX Restricted Treasury via Sablier Stream\n600,000 FOX available to claim (11/2/21)\n329,518,327 FOX ← Available DAO Treasury\n~325 million from airdrop\n~25 million from sablier stream\n“Expenses” ~19 million FOX so far: Treasury disbursements\n\n\nRequirements of the TMDC:\nThe TMDC priority is to take a holistic approach to DAO treasury management, and must act toward the long-term success of FOX token and the ShapeShift DAO.\nThe committee will be a dedicated team of members carefully watching, acting and reporting on a weekly basis.\n60,000,000 FOX is available to the committee to implore strategies as they see fit. Examples: collateralization/ debt, liquidity provision, yield farming, and other defi strategies.\nThe committee will administer the pools the community owns. (adding assets, ltv ratios, admin fees, recommending liquidity incentives etc)\nIf the committee should want to sell FOX: The committees tactics should have limited price impact on the FOX token, no one tactic can drop the price by more than 2%\n\nCurrent roadmap/plan:\nParticipate in all active discussions currently happening in the forum and make sure on day 1 we can be effective stewards of the Treasury.\nIncluding but not limited to: Rari, FEI/TRIBE, Index Coop\nAssist the Support Workstream \n\nThings this committee should consider and that have support:\nObtain enough Stablecoins for 1 year of runway\nTo be able to support the work streams in salary, promotional giveaways and pay for subscriptions/services. (ETH, Stables, etc)\nDesign and implement a strategy that manages assets and debts to achieve 2+ years runway\n\nBenefits:\nTo be able to act quickly, manage and execute on treasury management and diversification strategies to allow for a more active, holistic and long-term approach to treasury management.\nDrawbacks:\nThere are risks in trusting in 5 committee members of 60,000,000 FOX. We have tried to combat them by having a check and balance with the signers of the DAO being separate. We also have limited the risk to only 6% of the overall treasury. As well as a trial basis for these 5 committee members.\n\nVote:\nYes- I support the establishment of the Treasury Management and Diversification Committee and elect the following members to the committee: Danielle, Amicus.eth / Rotorless, albitrage / Al, profMcC, seven7hwave/ Kent\n\nNo- I do not support this proposal in its current form",

      "title": "[SCP-35] Proposal for $1M FOX:RUNE token swap and joint LP with THORChain",
      "content": "**Summary**\n\nProposal to swap $1M of FOX tokens for $1M of RUNE with the THORChain Treasury, then deposit $2M of FOX & RUNE to kickstart the [FOX:RUNE Pool](https://app.thorswap.finance/pool/ETH.FOX-0XC770EEFAD204B5180DF6A14EE197D99D808EE52D) on THORChain.\n\n**Abstract**\n\nTHORChain and ShapeShift DAO have long been good friends. ShapeShift provides a free web and mobile interface to THORChain, and THORChain powers ShapeShift’s cross-chain swapping. Our values are closely aligned, and we’ve been exploring ways to further strengthen our blossoming relationship.\n\nA member of the THORChain community reached out to propose a $1M FOX/RUNE swap in which…\n\n1. ShapeShift DAO sends $1M in FOX directly to the [THORChain deployer](https://www.notion.so/e1e5dd6bd58d3fa79caecc4da46c8866)\n2. THORChain sends $1M of RUNE to ShapeShift DAO\n3. Both Treasuries deposit $2M of FOX & RUNE to the [FOX:RUNE Pool](https://app.thorswap.finance/pool/ETH.FOX-0XC770EEFAD204B5180DF6A14EE197D99D808EE52D) on THORChain and increase the depth of the pool’s liquidity by $4,000,000\n\n**Motivation/Benefits**\n\nIn addition to strengthening the relationship between the ShapeShift DAO and THORChain communities and aligning incentives, the following benefits will be gained:\n\n1. Diversifying ShapeShift DAO’s Treasury to include RUNE, an asset with strong tokenomics and upside potential\n2. Establishing FOX liquidity on THORChain, enabling decentralized cross-chain swaps for FOX for the first time, and opening the door for FOX holders to LP on THORChain\n3. ShapeShift DAO’s liquidity position will earn revenues from trade fees and RUNE emissions\n\n**Specification**\n\nBecause the [DAO’s Gnosis Safe](https://gnosis-safe.io/app/#/safes/0x90A48D5CF7343B08dA12E067680B4C6dbfE551Be/) cannot hold native RUNE (only ETH and ERC20 tokens), and LPing on THORChain requires native RUNE, a THORChain multisig address must be created to receive the RUNE and deposit into the liquidity pool on behalf of the DAO. Hopefully in the near future a solution for this is built (ie. Gnosis Safe + SafeSnap on Cosmos) and the multisig can be replaced by the DAO.\n\n1. To facilitate the receipt and LP of RUNE, a new THORChain multisig address will be created on behalf of the DAO by @mperklin and myself (@willyfox)\n2. $1M FOX will be transferred from ShapeShift DAO’s Gnosis Safe to the [THORChain Deployer contract](https://www.notion.so/e1e5dd6bd58d3fa79caecc4da46c8866), and $1M of RUNE will be transferred to the DAO’s THORChain multisig address\n3. Both ShapeShift DAO and THORChain will deposit $1M of FOX and $1M of RUNE into the [FOX:RUNE pool](https://app.thorswap.finance/pool/ETH.FOX-0XC770EEFAD204B5180DF6A14EE197D99D808EE52D) which was just churned in on November 2, 2021 and already has ~$3.5M of liquidity as of November 8th\n4. The DAO’s FOX:RUNE Liquidity will remain in THORChain generating revenues for the DAO indefinitely, and any changes will require a subsequent proposal\n\n**Drawbacks**\n\nFor now at least, the DAO must rely on a multisig in order to swap and LP RUNE. Additional possible risks include the price of RUNE decreasing or the network being exploited and/or halted.\n\n**Vote**\nYay: Execute $1M FOX:RUNE token swap and deposit $2M of FOX & RUNE liquidity to THORChain\nNay: Do not execute FOX:RUNE token swap",

      "title": "Elect Diggy as Product Workstream leader for 4 months",
      "content": "Hello Foxes! Thank you for reviewing and voting on this proposal!\n\nMotivation:\nWith CAO stepping down as temporary Product Workstream Leader, the opportunity for Product Workstream Leader has opened. After a lot of thought and discussion with WillyFox, the Product Workstream contributors and members of other Workstreams, I have decided to step into consideration for this role. I was the Senior UX Manager on the Product Team with centralized ShapeShift for two and a half years, and previously was Director of UX at different organizations for over 7 years.\n\nThe success of the DAO and the ShapeShift products are our ultimate goals, and I believe the experience I bring to the table is critical, especially in these early months where so much is changing and evolving. I have many years of experience leading; contributing to and designing innovative, successful products; working collaboratively with engineering and other teams; and fostering a culture of user-focused product design.\n\nIn the DAO I think it’s important that the Workstream Leader understands the products we’re building, the needs at hand, and helps ensure that the right resources and talent are coordinated to create these fantastic products (currently in our roadmap and others that arise!).\n\nBy taking on this role, I would still be spearheading the UX for our products. However, I’ve spoken with Beard, and we feel that he will be able to dive in and help take on more of the UX responsibilities so that we divide and conquer on the UX front. We would also likely need to find additional UX resources to help out on a bounty basis.\n\nSpecification:\nWillyFox, CAO and I have written a JD for Product Workstream Leader that can be found here: https://www.notion.so/shapeshift/Job-Description-Product-Workstream-Leader-0d30263cf4a44d9f987f95ad552827b3\n\nI also think that as this is a new role, and given that we’re a DAO, this role would likely shift and evolve over time and as new needs arise. I am proposing to step into this role for 4 months to start with, through the end February 2022. During this time, the Workstream can be built out and its successes evaluated. I will do my best to ensure its success!\n\nNo funding is required for this proposal.\n\nDrawbacks:\nNone that I can think of. With Beard stepping up to help out more on UX, and the Workstream recruiting some additional design help on an as needed basis, and bringing on one or more Product Managers, we should be set up for DAO success!\n\nVote:\nFor: to elect Diggy as Product Workstream Leader for 4 months\nAgainst: to do nothing",

      "title": "[SCP-31] Proposal to the DAO regarding receipt of ShapeShift Cards (SHAPESHIFTCD)",
      "content": "**Summary**\n\nThe ShapeShift corporation plans to burn 649 ShapeShift CD’s in its possession (original spells of genesis NFTs from 2015 https://xchain.io/asset/SHAPESHIFTCD), retain 16 of them for sale on behalf of the corporation through end of the year and give the remaining 16 to the ShapeShift DAO treasury. In order to receive these cards, FOX token holders will need to signal agreement via voting for this proposal to the following terms: 5 cards immediately available for transfer by the DAO (up to FOX governance whether to sell or hold them), 5 additional cards cannot be transferred/sold for at least 1 year and the last 6 cards cannot be transferred/sold for at least 2 years.\n\n**Abstract**\n\nAfter ShapeShift corp burns 649 of the 681 cards in its possession, less than 200 such cards will ever exist in the wild which would make them among the most rare SoG cards in existence and among the oldest NFTs in existence. These are some of the earliest NFTs (circa 2015) that were minted by Spells of Genesis and given to ShapeShift as part of our partnership supporting their early blockchain-based game development. These could end up being some of the rarest and most historical NFTs ever.\n\n**Motivation**\n\nBy agreeing to the terms laid out in (1), the DAO will get a gift of 16 historical ShapeShift themed NFT cards which will unlock over the next 2 years in 3 tranches (5 available immediately, 5 that cannot be moved for 1 year, and 6 that cannot be moved for 2 years). The cards could prove to be a valuable and important asset of the ShapeShift DAO treasury, and whether the DAO sells or holds these NFTs for the long term is up to FOX Token holders.\n\n**Specification**\n\nThe ShapeShift corp will be burning 649 ShapeShift CD’s on XCP this week, and then moving the remaining 32 in its possession from XCP to Ethereum via the Emblem Vault bridge. Once that happens 16 will remain in the corp’s possession to be auctioned off on behalf of its shareholders, and the remaining 16 will be sent to the DAO if the DAO votes to ratify this proposal and its terms around the tranches unlocking.\n\n**Benefits**\n\nThe major benefit is the DAO is gifted 16 of these extremely rare and historical ShapeShift themed NFT cards, it has the option to sell some of them immediately, and more in the future over the next 1-2 years as further tranches unlock. Whether the DAO sells these NFTs for ETH, holds them for the long term, or some combination thereof they will become a valuable and important asset in the ShapeShift DAO treasury.\n\n**Drawbacks**\n\nI do not see any major drawbacks to this proposal other than some of the DAO’s newly acquired NFTs cannot be sold for 1-2 years, but given the DAO currently owns 0 of these I don’t see that as a major problem. There is some chance the NFTs do not end up being valuable and become a non-useful asset, but even in that case no harm is done to the DAO.\n\n**Vote**\n\nA “for” vote would mean agreeing to the terms of the DAO treasury accepting 16 ShapeShift CD’s into its treasury (5 available immediately, 5 after one year, and the final 6 after 2 years). These terms would need to be enforced by social consensus of the DAO with token holders agreeing to downvote any proposal that would try to break these terms over the next 2 years.\n\nAn “against” vote would mean not agreeing to the terms and no ShapeShift CD’s would be sent to the DAO treasury.\n\nSpecial thanks to the SoG community for helping advise and bring these important assets to light on behalf of the DAO (especially TG, White Rabbit, and Cornholio)",

      "title": "Should[SCP-32] Addendum to Proposal [SCP-25] the FOX Bond program through OlympusDAO",
      "content": "Summary: Proposal to add an Addendum to SCP-25, creating a committee to be able to make changes on behalf of the DAO under predefined guidelines established within this proposal. The bond committee would have the power to change the max number of bonds as well as the max payout for the duration of the initial bond program, which runs through the end of February 2022.\n\nMotivation: The first couple of days of the FOX bond program has been\nwildly successful, and this would allow for us to better capitalize on this high demand moving forward. It is to be able to better capitalize on the demand of these FOX bonds and to acquire more DAO-owned liquidity and do so at an appropriate rate. This would mean being able to allocate more funds from the treasury to the smart contract and increasing the offerings of bonds for a given period of time through the support of this proposal by the community. This will allow for the DAO to better capture and realize the true demand of these bonds and purchase their liquidity through this offering.\n\nSpecification: The committee would be formed to implement changes to the number of bonds and rewards issued in the bond program on behalf of the DAO. They voted on parameters of daily reward amounts between 14,454 FOX to 144,530 FOX. This would be accomplished through a majority vote by committee members after hearing out the thoughts of the community during an open meeting. Any increase that is voted on will result in a need to deposit more fox for the tentative period of time that we are looking to increase. The point person from the committee would work with the Olympus DAO team to get these changes made to the FOX bonds and work with the treasury to get any additional funds required distributed to the smart contract.  Ron/PTT would like to nominate himself as the point person to work with \ncommunicating and collaborating these agreed-upon changes to the OHM team and working with them to get the bonds updated.\n\nThis proposal will allow for the committee members to trigger the allocation of additional FOX from the treasury based on the parameters set through the ideations post.  \n\nI would like to additionally propose that these committee team members are\ncompensated for their time each month. A 400 FOX allocation per month for each committee member and an additional 600 FOX for the point committee member handling the additional work of communicating and coordinating the changes with the Olympus DAO and the treasury. This distribution will occur monthly until the end of February 2022. \n\nPoll Results: See forum post for results.\nPoll 1: I propose that the committee have the ability to increase the bond/reward amounts to up to 5 times the agreed-upon rate in the original proposal through a majority vote based on community feedback. This amount would be on behalf of the community to increase the rewards per day up to a total of 144,540 FOX which may result in the need for additional distribution of FOX from the treasury.\nPoll 2: We had a 90% vote in favor of the committee having the ability to be able to lower the bond/reward amounts vs the current rates. Due to this, I am moving forward with proposing that the committee have the ability to decrease the bond/reward amount based on the currently approved proposal at as low as the rate of 50% based on Poll #3. Proposal stating that the committee can vote on behalf of the community to decrease the rewards per day down to a total of 14,454 FOX. \nPoll #4:  I am proposing that the committee be Ron/PTT, JoshF, Neverwas, Marley Shapeshift, and Hunt.  \n\nBenefits: The committee being in place would allow for a better reaction to\nmarket conditions for the bonds vs having to go through the lengthy, 10-day\nminimum, governance process currently in place. This includes the ability to sell more bonds when the market demands it and lower the number of bonds when the market isn’t looking for them. In addition to the previous benefits of the original proposal.\n\nDrawbacks/Risks: A potential risk is that committee could go rogue and act against the community’s consensus, but due to the fact that we have 2 former ShapeShifters with a combined 12 years of experience working for ShapeShift corporation involved(one which is the engineering workstream leader, the other recently passing a proposal), and three highly involved members with the community and involved with workstreams as well, I think the chances of this are incredibly low. In addition to the previous benefits of the original proposal.\n\n\nVOTE\nFor: Create the FOX bond committee to make changes to the FOX bonds through the end of the program in February 2022\nAgainst: We do nothing.",

      "title": "[SCP-19] ShapeShift DAO x 1Hive Partnership (FOX/HNY LP)",
      "content": "1. Summary - ShapeShift DAO and 1Hive DAO will execute a community swap of approximately $100,000 in equivalence of FOX and HNY (1Hive’s native token). Two DAOs partnering to provide liquidity is extremely powerful, especially when the culture and motives are aligned. By performing the respective DAOs’ token swap (herewith referred to as DAO2DAO, or “D2D”), we share the risk and rewards of the two DAOs.\n\n---\n\n2. Abstract\n\nAn excellent writeup of the mechanisms of a “D2D Collaboration/Joint Venture” by PrimeDAO can be read [here](https://medium.com/primedao/exploring-dao2dao-collaboration-mechanisms-c37218a17a21). A great summary by Kyle from 1Hive of what a D2D venture would look like can be read [here.](https://forum.shapeshift.com/t/scp-19-official-ideation-thread-incentivized-liquidity-mining-program-for-honeyswap-on-xdai/548/3)\n\n> In other words, both communities now are rationally incentivized to act in the other community’s interest, because they both own a stake in the other. Each community has also hedged their own risk, by transferring some of that risk to the counter party community. This act marries the two communities together.\n\n$100K of tokens will be swapped ($100K of HNY for ShapeShift, $100K of FOX for 1Hive). Without changing the overall balance sheet of the respective DAOs, we are able to provide much more liquidity because it would be in the best interest of our shared risk and reward.\n\nIn addition, this joint venture opens up new doors for future potential projects which would be mutually beneficial to ShapeShift and 1Hive.\n\n---\n\n3. Motivation\n\nThere have been calls by the community and an overwhelming support in general for an incentivized FOX pool on xDai.\n\nA joint venture with 1Hive, the operators of HoneySwap, is a very rational move by ShapeShift DAO, as they are the largest and most liquid DEX for the xDai network, which our DAO is so heavily reliant on for payments.\n\n---\n\n4. Specification\n\nThe 1st of 2 proposals on 1Hive’s side is set to pass by the time this proposal goes live: [1hive proposal](https://gardens-xdai.1hive.org/#/garden/0x8ccbeab14b5ac4a431fffc39f4bec4089020a155/proposal/55)\n\nBecause of how 1Hive’s governance and treasury works, a second proposal would need to pass to send the amount of HNY required for a full $100K swap.\n\n  1. 350 HNY (approximately $100K) will be sent to a 6-member multisig, in which 3 signatories are from ShapeShift and 3 signatories are from 1Hive. Four signatures will be required for the execution of any multisig transactions. The proposed signatories on the ShapeShift is: willyfox, jonshapeshift, and mperklin.\n\n  2. 665K FOX, assuming this proposal passes, would be moved to the aforementioned multisig. The amount was pegged at 950 FOX / HNY, as historically the price of HNY and FOX have ranged between 900-1000 FOX/HNY and the1Hive treasury needs to vote to move funds, and the process takes time.\n\n  3. When the 2nd vote passes on 1Hive DAO, another 350 HNY will be unlocked and sent to provide liquidity.\n\n  4. Liquidity will then be added to the HNY+FOX pool — 50% of the resulting LP tokens would be sent to ShapeShift DAO’s treasury, and the other 50% to 1Hive DAO’s treasury.\n\n  5. This is where the power of a D2D collaboration comes into play — because our alignment of interest, the resulting liquidity would be approximately $400K.\n\n  If at any point there is a misstep, miscommunication, or misalignment, assets would be returned back to the respective DAOs and the project re-evaluated.\n\n**Time and Work Compensation**: This proposal is the result of over a month of coordination, planning, and ideation from both sides of the DAO. Therefore, we have agreed that compensation for our time and efforts should be considered. We are requesting $2.5K in FOX to be split amongst myself (2/5th), monstrosity (2/5th), and kyle (1/5th).\n\n---\n\n5. Benefits\n\n- More liquidity for contributors and leaders that are paid by the DAO\n- Diversifying the DAO’s treasury while partnering with another respected DAO\n- More liquidity of FOX on xDai at a “discounted price”\n\n---\n\n6. Drawbacks\n\n- Taking on the risk of another DAO’s success\n\n---\n\nLinks\n- [SCP-19 Ideation Thread](https://forum.shapeshift.com/t/scp-19-official-ideation-thread-incentivized-liquidity-mining-program-for-honeyswap-on-xdai/548)\n- [More on 1Hive DAO](https://wiki.1hive.org/)\n- [HoneySwap DEX](https://app.honeyswap.org/)\n\n---\n\n**Vote**\n\nYES - Allocate 665K FOX for the D2D joint venture, and compensate the parties involved in the making of this proposal.\nNO - No action.",

      "title": "[SCP- 30] Commission to create 10 “Creatures of Cryptozoology” NFTs for the ShapeShift DAO Treasury",
      "content": "Summary -\nMy proposal is to create 10 “Creatures of Cryptozoology” crypto animal themed NFTs, creatively telling the history of crypto over the years through these animals.These will be awarded to the ShapeShift DAO treasury for resale/auction as an income potential. A few of the animals I may include are: unicorn, bear whale, honey badger, alpaca, shibu, bear, bull…all the fun animals.\n\nAbstract -\nThis proposal will include 10 custom animal themed digital art pieces, each individually minted and transferred to the Shapeshift DAO. Each piece will be uniquely its own and share the history of cryptocurrency through these 10 animals. These pieces will be the DAO’s to auction off, sell or hold onto as they see fit for the greatest benefit of the DAO.\n\nMotivation -\nAfter my first proposal, creating the 10 NFTs for the contributors of the ShapeShift DAO, I fell in love with ShapeShift’s robust DAO community and want to continue to create and help share the visual culture that is forming here. I see art as a connector in these communities helping memorialize what is happening in this space.\n\nI also received many requests from the community to create more NFTs for the DAO and felt this next proposal could not only give back to the community but also continue to enhance the value of FOX and the ShapeShift DAO brand.\n\nMy hope is to add value outwardly to the DAO by getting involved in the NFT community, bringing new artists into this community and making space and excitement for other creatives to share their gifts.\n\nIf you would like to see the collection I created for my first proposal you can view that here: https://opensea.io/collection/shapeshiftdaonfts .\n\nSpecification -\nI will create and mint 10 NFTs that will be transferred to the ShapeShift DAO that will be delivered at the rate of 1-2 pieces per week at the cost of 2800 FOX per piece totaling 28,000 FOX. I will be in charge of delivering the NFTs to the correct address and help coordinate with the DAO treasury. I will put a 10% commission on secondary sales into the NFT contracts (via OpenSea) and I will give ½ of the proceeds back to the DAO when it sells and/or resells for the lifetime of the NFT.\n\nBenefits -\nThis is an opportunity for revenue creation, a unique marketing angle and excitement for the DAO. It is a way to help the DAO become involved in different communities therefore drawing in new members.\n\nArt is a form of communication and by adding in some visual mediums into the DAO could help the DAO expand its reach.\n\nAlong with the initial sale of the NFTs there is an infinite possibility of further secondary sales, thus adding even more revenue back into the DAO.\n\nDrawbacks -\nThe NFTs may not sell as quickly as the DAO would like or at a lower price than wanted at first.\n\nVote-\nA “for” vote would mean funding 28,000 FOX in order to commission the creation and minting of 10 individual NFTS. Those NFTs would be transferred to the ShapeShift DAO treasury for sale/auction. It would also mean the DAO gains 5% of any future sales of these NFTs.\n\nAn “against” would mean no creation of NFTs for the ShapeShift DAO treasury.",

      "title": "[SCP-17] Launch Stable FOX ($oneFOX)",
      "content": "**Summary** \nAs promised on the last two ShapeShift DAO community calls, this is a proposal to partner with the ICHI community to create $oneFOX, a stable branded dollar backed  by $FOX. You must deposit $FOX tokens to mint $oneFOX, a token valued at $1.\n\n**Abstract**\n$oneFOX will be the 7th ICHI V2 stable asset, following stable assets created for Filecoin, 1INCH, Uniswap, etc. It never made sense for different communities to govern the different features of money. ICHI makes it possible for every community to have their own everyday currency backed by their scarce crypto.\n\n**Motivation**\nMore value will be retained within the $FOX economy. Instead of selling $FOX tokens for assets issued by other communities, ShapeShift DAO can use its own asset to conduct business or create dollar-denominated exposure/loans in decentralized finance.\n\n**Specification**\nICHI (conditional on a successful ICHI DAO vote):\n- Launches $oneFOX (0x03352D267951E96c6F7235037C5DFD2AB1466232)\n- Provides 67k ICHI in rewards to $oneFOX deposits over 3 months ($320k value)\n\nShapeShift DAO (conditional on this vote and a successful deployment of $oneFOX):\n- Funds 50% of the cost of initial ICHI rewards ($160k). ICHI will use this entire amount to mint $oneFOX and hold it for a minimum of 12 months, increasing safety and enabling initial DeFi insurance.\n- Loans 1.5M $FOX tokens to the $oneFOX treasury to lower initial minting ratio from 98% to 80%. Users will deposit an estimated additional 1.5M $FOX tokens in the initial minting period as a result of this loan.\n- Docs and audits, including one from Quantstamp, are available on ichi.org for those who want a deeper understanding.\n\n**Benefits**\nHere are a few benefits of $oneFOX to the $FOX economy:\n- $FOX Use Case: You must deposit $FOX to mint $oneFOX.\n- ICHI Rewards: Deposits of $oneFOX will earn ICHI rewards.\n- -Revenue: 80% of the yield generated by ICHI strategies stays in the $oneFOX treasury which belongs to the $FOX community. 10% may be distributed to applications that leverage $oneFOX. 10% goes to staked ICHI ($xICHI).\n- Protocol Locked Liquidity: The $oneFOX treasury will provide liquidity to $oneFOX and $FOX on exchanges such as Uniswap V3.\n- Discounts/Interest: $oneFOX holders can vote to allocate treasury towards providing discounts when spending or better interest when saving.\n\n**Drawbacks**\nIf the $oneFOX treasury’s reserve ratio drops beneath 200%, ICHI’s recommended minimum, the ShapeShift DAO may need to contribute more $FOX, or $oneFOX Governance may need to rebalance $FOX into $USDC. This could happen if:\n- The price of $FOX declines severely\n- The value of the $oneFOX treasury’s investment positions declines severely\n- A large quantity of $oneFOX is redeemed for $USDC in a short period of time\n\nThe $oneFOX treasury’s DeFi investment positions may also be subject to token lockup periods or market liquidity risk. As a result, $USDC redemptions may be delayed until a treasury rebalance is possible.\n\n**Mitigations**\nYield on $oneFOX treasury assets, $oneFOX minting ratio adjustments, and $oneFOX redemption fees drive over-collateralization, which reduces the likelihood of the reserve ratio dropping beneath 150% or redemptions being delayed.\n\n**$oneFOX Governance**\n\n$oneFOX is a token worth $1 that is minted with exactly $1 of value in two parts: part $FOX, part USDC. $oneFOX Governance controls various parameters of the $oneFOX contract and selects the investment strategy for the $oneFOX treasury’s funds. $oneFOX Governance may also upgrade the $oneFOX contract’s code or implement new investment strategies, though these actions require the approval of the ICHI DAO.\n\nGovernance within the ICHI system is divided into two sections based on scope of authority:\n1. Global (ICHI) Governance - provides boundaries in which local/instance governance can operate. (Read more about ICHI governance here.)\n2. $oneFOX Governance - can make adjustments to parameters affecting a single oneToken instance.\n\nThe ShapeShift DAO can perform any $oneFOX governance actions directly by passing a proposal, but a 4-of-6 multisignature scheme will be used for day-to-day operations. Two of the signers will be nominated from the ICHI DAO community, and four will be nominated from the ShapeShift DAO community.  Here are the initial nominations:\n- Joshf (ShapeShift DAO): 0x5b8de63AFdeEdc64eb752623b49fc3A8Bd221245\n- Tyler (ShapeShift DAO): 0x71D1567aECb9aDB1BC41f1b91525344d0FAFdF93\n- WillyFox (ShapeShift DAO): - 0x1D01A2FefB8883A5cfB8c77B19d9b96794581288\n- Mperklin (ShapeShift DAO): 0x72E7b10ed4E45b57E5b97445BC5BA25501E76154\n- 37Aces (ICHI DAO): 0x0dd4C0c16Fff6693e169Ef89235Cb92F9D8943EE\n- Dhtal (ICHI DAO): 0xaD187f2D2e7957411475f7a66F1Fff273b38cAd5\n\nA ShapeShift DAO proposal and successful vote is required to replace a Shapeshift signer with a new one, to replace an ICHI signer with a Shapeshift signer, or to change the threshold and number of signers.  An ICHI DAO vote is required to replace an ICHI signer with a new ICHI signer.\n\n**Signing Process**\nA full breakdown of the signing process, permitted transactions, and un-permitted transactions can be found here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1w1-neGR-WZHhuB38okEMtR2m-kSbcr53tRNSbGyp2gI/edit?usp=sharing\n \nFor\nLaunch $oneFOX\nAgainst\nDo Nothing",

      "content": "To truly help ShapeShift build a borderless financial system, OnJuno wants to collaborate to provide compliant onramps and offramps with low fees to Shapeshift members and contributors. The DAO would get a certain % of these fees.\n\nWith this proposal, OnJuno aims to provide -\n\nInstant one-time and recurring buy and sell crypto feature for ShapeShift, Portis and Keepkey members\nSeamless offramp for Shapeshift members and DAO contributors\nDAO partnership revenue share and cash flows. Exact amounts discussed below.\nFor those who are not familiar, OnJuno 3 works at the intersection of banking, crypto and DeFi to offer 4 key features:\n\nCompliant way to take entire or a part of paycheck in crypto\nBuy-sell & send-receive crypto instantly from a checking account at low fees\n5% crypto-back on select brands of your choice\nYield Product: 4% on savings vault using DeFi (coming soon)\nPreviously, our team was behind the Nuo protocol, which was one of the top five DeFi protocols on DeFi pulse in early 2019. Today, our vision is to make banking fair and transparent by helping members manage and grow their cash and crypto-assets seamlessly. We’re backed by an exciting line of investors like Sequoia Surge, Mithril Capital, Consensys, Polychain Capital, Greycroft, Hashed, Dragonfly Capital and more. We also count Balaji Srinivasan, Surojit from Coinbase, Sriram from a16z, Mike Dudas from Paxos, Salil from Uncorrelated as angel investors and advisors.\n\nAbstract:\n\nAs a Shapeshift member, I want to be able to convert my fiat to crypto and vice versa via bank/ach transfers almost instantly at low fees. Other partners take 1-3 days before a crypto purchase is funded using ACH and debit/credit card method has lower limits and higher fees. OnJuno, with its existing banking infrastructure, helps eliminate this delay without any extra fees.\nAs a DAO contributor, I want to convert my crypto earnings in BTC, ETH, USDC to cash in a simple, low-cost way to help me pay my bills. OnJuno lets me manage my cash and crypto holdings and conversions seamlessly without worrying about my tax filings as my transaction details are aptly captured.\nFor helping OnJuno get more early adopters and volumes, they provide an affiliate/commission based revenue model where in DAO would receive a % of the transaction fee. This aligns perfectly with the DAO’s partnership revenue model.\nBenefits/Motivations for ShapeShift Community:\n\nSince OnJuno is a neobanking platform, it can help process one-time or recurring cash to crypto conversions using bank/ACH transfers instantly. While other partners process instant conversions with debit cards and credit cards, they charge high fees with low transaction limits. However, with OnJuno, the fees will remain as low as 0.95%, without any spread or hidden fees with a starting transaction limit of $10,000 per day, which is likely to increase over time. This would be an improvement over existing partners and onramps that require 1-3 days before a crypto purchase is funded using ACH transfers.\n\nFor DAO employees, OnJuno can provide a simple, low-cost way to convert crypto into cash and have the cash deposits go directly into OnJuno Checking Account for paying bills or everyday spending. This would give seamless payment records for DAO contributors to make tax filings much easier.\n\n30% of the 0.95% transaction fees generated from this partnership would flow in as revenue back to the DAO and with this affiliate based model, OnJuno ensures that the community truly benefits from this partnership.\n\nBenefits/Motivations for OnJuno:\n\nEarly engaged members via this partnership\nRevenue from increased transaction volumes and spends (Crypto trading, Interchange)\nDrawbacks\n\nIn order to stay compliant with Bank Secrecy Act and Anti Money Laundering (AML) legislation, quick KYC will be required to create a new FDIC insured checking account and avail the benefits of these onramps and offramps. However, KYC is a one-time requirement and will ensure secure usage on the platform. Currently, this is a US-only offering but is likely to expand to the UK, Canada and Europe soon.\n\nVote “Yes” if you would like to see OnJuno integrated as Onramp and Offramp for ShapeShift members and DAO contributors and share 30% of the revenue back to the DAO.\n\nVote “NO” if you don’t want to see OnJuno integrated with Shapeshift or not in this way/at this time",

      "title": "[SCP-27] Proposed Roadmap through December 2021",
      "content": "Summary\nThis is a proposal for the roadmap for the ShapeShift product until December 2021. The roadmap includes plans to continue open sourcing code as well as adding new features; it defines where the works is to be done; and how it will be completed (inside or outside the workstream).\n\nAbstract\nA link to the roadmap can be found here: https://www.notion.so/shapeshift/68196f67e07943ed8bb1e10ac7d1430d?v=024c941b800e48d580630470d282e3dd\n\nFairdrop: this is complete and is being announced today! This was voted on by the community and includes additional DeFi communities in the airdrop.\n\nSend and Receive (ETH): this has been completed in the open source version and will bring the open source web app up to parity with beta.shapeshift.com 2. Send and receive will work for other blockchains when they are added. I have it marked as 70% complete since it is not yet available to users.\n\nSecond round of FOX farming: this was voted on and passed by the community. It extends fox farming in the uniswap v2 pool.\n\nAdding MetaMask to HD wallet: this will allow users to connect their MetaMask wallet to the open source version. One of our big requests is to have additional wallet support, especially for MetaMask, so this will accomplish at least part of this request.\n\nYearn: This will allow users to deposit into Yearn vaults. ShapeShift will be part of the Yearn partner program that will generate revenue for the DAO.\n\nBitcoin Blockchain Unchained & Bitcoin Blockchain Chain Adapters: this is the second blockchain being added so that we can cross chain support and so that the open source version is closer to parity with beta.shapeshift.com 2.\n\nPost airdrop screens: this is a small lift that tells users the airdrop has ended and points users to FOX farming.\n\nDisplay DeFi positions: This will show users all their DeFi positions when they connect their wallet.\n\n.com updates & adding new pages: this is to updates shapeshift.com.\n\nAdding swapper into lib: this is code we have for beta.shapeshift.com 2 and by open sourcing it, it will be easier for anyone to add a swapping protocol.\n\nTendermint Blockchains: this is architecture for Tendermint blockchains so that each one can be easily added.\n\nOsmosis Trading, Staking on Osmo, LP Cosmo/Osmo, KeepKey Osmo support: This was a proposal by ss-danielle that was passed by the community. The team has begun working on this.\n\nOpenSea Milestone 1: graymachine has taken on writing the specs for this. This will include an affiliate link so that the DAO can generate revenue.\n\nStaking on Cosmos: Once staking on osmo has been complete, this will be very similar and will give users another option to earn yield on their crypto.\n\nWallet SDK: This is the long term plan to support multiple wallets and have cross chain support.\n\nAdd liquifier to lib: This is code that needs to be open sourced so that anyone can more easily add different protocols to earn yield.\n\n0x Trading Mainnet: this is a feature that is in beta.shapeshift.com 2 and will bring the open source version closer to parity with beta.shapeshift.com 2.\n\nTHORChain Blockchain Unchained & Chain Adapters: This adds THORChain to the open source version bringing to close to parity with beta.shapeshift.com 2.\n\nTHORChain swapping: this is currently in beta.shapeshift.com 2, and by adding it, we will bring the open source version to parity with beta.shapeshift.com 2\n\nOther EVM chains: this adds additional EVM chains via unchain and chain adapters.\n\n0x Trading on other EVM chains: this will allow users to trade on additional chains besides ETH mainnet.\n\nMotivation\nThis lays out a plan for the development of the product. It allows everyone to be aligned with goals and why features are being added when. By passing the roadmap (or one that is very similar), the community will be able to contribute more easily and other protocols will be able to integrate into our platform and the DAO will be able to generate revenue.\n\nDrawbacks\nThere is a lot on the medium term roadmap and there is some needed architecture that needs to be added so that features can be added easily and quickly. However, I believe by going this route, we will build momentum and community members will be able to work with the code easily and other protocols will be motivated to partner with ShapeShift.\n\nVote\nFor: a vote for this means you support the priority and plan of the roadmap\nAgainst: a vote means you do not support this roadmap or support a different priority of work.\n\n",

      "title": "Proposal to Fund the Customer Support Workstream: Jan 1-April 30, 2022",
      "content": "**Mission:** Delight and educate customers as they navigate and experience The ShapeShift DAO.\n\n**Goals:**\n\n* Create and maintain a self-service helpdesk using Zendesk.\n* Redesign current helpdesk (requires cross-DAO efforts).\n* Provide a streamlined ticketing system that operates 7 days a week.\n* Sustain a 48 hour first response time for all user inquiries (current first response times in centralized ShapeShift are < 8 hours, and we suspect this to remain with the current rate of tickets, but a spike in the markets or a particular feature of the platform could result in longer wait times). Most crypto companies respond within 72 hours, so our base of 48 hours will keep us competitive.\n* Maintain a presence in Discord and other social channels to funnel all high-level support needs to the formal ticketing system.\n* Increase total number of app reviews by targeting happy users.\n* Data reporting on customer support interactions, satisfaction, feedback, and bug reports.\n\n**Success Metrics:**\n\n* Weekly Productivity Goals for Customer Support Agents are met (targets will be established within first 30 days)\n* Monthly Quality Assurance score >93%\n* Monthly Customer Satisfaction Score >93%\n* Helpdesk Content successfully running through the auditing process by January 30th.\n* Monthly Customer Support Workstream calls held to review product changes, support protocol changes, and quality assurance awards.\n* 5+ app or Trust Pilot reviews each month.\n\n\n**Budget:** https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tnsJfzk6yt-cD4b4N1k-FrEmmEBUKZbRBJy8bi4dEbs/edit#gid=0\n\n**Staffing:**\n\nWorkstream Leader - 1 @cryptohmeg\n  * JD: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1a4_sMA81xnLnbBk-6HcDNjZgtterOWh2qZmElM35k7E/edit\n  * The goal of this position is to “keep the lights on”, ie: pay vendors, leadership training and consultation, proposal management, cross-team communication, with the end goal of phasing this role down to an advisory position that assists team on a parttime basis with vendor relationships and high-level general needs. The goal for the transition to “advisor” 8-12 months. You can see more on this plan in the “[Assign @cryptohmeg as Customer Support Workstream Leader”.](https://snapshot.org/#/shapeshiftdao.eth/proposal/QmU4iW7SxxdNHvPnSS1ZGULWBWMQ2ANG2hqcGvtNyLK3um)\n\nData & Quality Assurance Manager- 1 @ssmarc\n  * JD: https://docs.google.com/document/d/15PLDzNMwaHHKc-CSHCssNKWV9yskMry8LEMBXpaAdfs/edit\n  * The DQA Manager manages all things productivity and performance with the support staff. Reports of agent and team performance as well as a detailed report of support data will be delivered weekly to the DAO community (see below for a sample of our QA system) - more specifically to the product and growth workstreams to ensure further understanding of the user experience. Monthly meetings will be held with the entire support staff to review scores, train on product changes, and discuss common roadblocks. At the monthly meeting “Chua Awards” will be issued to recognize top performers.\n\nThis role should be seen as the “glue” that holds the staff together.\n\nThis role is also on the “leadership team” of Customer Support.\n\n Helpdesk Manager- 1 @mogie\n  * JD: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QwcMGzApZvqajegzZ_Pi-PRYXbVlzWMSjzW1ecuYmRg/edit\n  * The helpdesk manager creates and oversees the creation, editing, and auditing process of our helpdesk content. This role will be a newer role for the team. In the past ShapeShift has relied more heavily on the ticketing queue, but in the spirit of decentralization we’d like to leverage our robust self-service helpdesk to educate our users. This cost-saving step will continue to pay back dividends over time as we phase down our reliance on real time staff for tickets and lean more on self-service articles.\n  * The role may also require the occasional contracting of writers for How-To product articles.\n\nThis role is also on the “leadership team” of Customer Support.\n\nSupport Staff Managers- 2 @ss-jules & @donna\n  * JD: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OTr0TF17JiBaV1qo882UjelNqEjXW0UGbLNhW1Slea8/edit\n  * To ensure quality support and training are provided to all support agents, we will need trainers and managers for teams of agents. Donna and Julius have been support team coaches for over a year and thrive in the 1:1 coaching environment. The challenge for them will be the constant training on new products, but if you’ve met or worked with either of them, you’ll notice their thirst to dive deep into topics.\n  * Their first set of goals will be revamping the current training materials to ensure speedy onboarding with new support staff when needed and doing a refresher course with the current batch of agents.\n\nThis role is also on the “leadership team” of Customer Support.\n\nSupport Agents - 7\n  * JD: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Uh4tm7uwZtGLMXLtVUVQKfR79dMHMOC_qOoGkk7PWI0/edit\n  * This role will be a traditional agent role. While the helpdesk is extremely important, there is no getting around that we need humans to assist with wonky hardware wallet and defi issues. We have a team in the Philippines that we have been working with for several years that are fantastic and take pride in their work!\n  * Having 7 agents allows for all 3 shifts to be covered, 7 days a week and sufficient coverage if agents take sick time or vacation. Although running this lean may lead to 1-2 shifts a week being short, this should not compromise overall SLAs much.\n  * If agents are cut in the middle of a proposal timeframe, the cost to employ these team members will be rolled over to the next proposal’s funding needs.\n  * Some agents may move to part time if needed. This will be announced in the Support Workstream forum and any additional funding that is not used to pay the contractor will be rolled over to the next round of funding.\n\nVote: \n\n\"Yes\" to fund the Customer Support workstream 209,520 USD for 4 months and support 12 full-time FOXes in delighting our customers.. \n\n\"No\" if you do not want to fund the Customer Support workstream 209,520 USD for 4 months and support 12 full-time FOXes in delighting our customers.

      "title": "Shall a ShapeShift Cosmos Validator be created?",
      "content": "Summary - This proposal would accomplish the following: 1. A validator will be run on the Cosmos blockchain with the intention of providing a revenue stream for the DAO. 2. This proposal is scoped to one blockchain, Cosmos. This will not only strengthen the ShapeShift DAO, by providing a revenue stream, but also provide security to other decentralized communities through trusted validation services.\n\nAbstract - We envision income from validating to be a core pillar of the ShapeShift DAO Tokenomics Workstream in the near future. There are many opportunities for the ShapeShift DAO to earn passive income through Proof of Stake activities on several blockchains. One such opportunity exists with the Cosmos blockchain. Cosmos is a Proof of Stake (PoS) blockchain built using the Tendermint core. A core function of the Cosmos blockchain is delegation and rewards for delegation. Delegation helps secure the network and participants earn rewards for their participation. More info can be found here: https://cosmos.network/learn/staking/. ShapeShift has been a participant in the Cosmos ecosystem since 2017. The Security and Information Technology team at ShapeShift have been securing the Cosmos network since the early days of the Cosmos blockchain and have become experts in the subject. The validator started as an R&D project and has since evolved into a steady stream of income for the business. This validator was done under an anonymous name. We believe that the DAO will benefit by continuing to support Cosmos in a more public manner.\n\nSpecification - We are proposing that the ShapeShift DAO continues to support and secure the Cosmos ecosystem by creating a ShapeShift validator. Setup and maintenance of the validator will be done by TaxiStake under the ShapeShift brand name. Rewards, in the form of USDC, would be distributed to the DAO to diversify the income streams of the DAO.\n\nLast year, the Cosmos validator for ShapeShift earned about $250,000 with no marketing or branding. We are proposing that the validator commission be set at 10% and The rewards from the ShapeShift validator will be distributed to the DAO treasury and TaxiStake in a 70%(DAO)/30%(TaxiStake) split for a 12 month period starting Nov 1st 2021 thru and including October 31st 2022. Cosmos users who delegate to the ShapeShift validator will be supporting the ShapeShift DAO as well as securing the Cosmos network. For the setup and overhead of this validator, TaxiStake is requesting a 50,000 FOX upfront grant and 100,000 FOX subsequent grant in a Sablier stream over the same 12 month period. FOX in a Sablier contract would allow the DAO to “terminate” TaxiStake by canceling the stream if we are not living up to the standards of this proposal. Also, a Sablier stream incentivizes TaxiStake to send commissions to the DAO. Taxistake will work to convert the ATOMs into an ETH based asset USDC until Gnosis safe adds ATOMs support or some kind of synthetic ATOM on ETH exists.\n\nOn successful completion of this initiative, the DAO community or TaxiStake can propose other projects for future staking activities on other blockchains under the ShapeShift brand with similar commission sharing incentives. TaxiStake has purchased an existing validator, Velocity V1 (cosmosvaloper199mlc7fr6ll5t54w7tts7f4s0cvnqgc59nmuxf), from ShapeShift and is ready to move forward using this validator.\n\n\nMotivation/Benefits - We have been operating validators on several chains professionally for several years. The ShapeShift validator, under our team’s supervision, secured over $60mil on the Cosmos Blockchain, at the market peak. With the opportunity to transition from ShapeShift employees to something else, we want to take on validating full time. We see this as a critical first step for the DAO to diversify and obtain an alternate revenue stream. Everyone would like to see the DAO succeed and we believe an essential pillar of its success is to have diversified revenue streams. The Tokenomics workstream is likely to be one of the largest of the DAO; we want to see validating as a crucial pillar. Right now, the DAO is 100% long FOX. A diverse portfolio of cryptocurrencies is crucial to the DAO’s long-term survival as well as meeting the values of a chain-agnostic open protocol that promotes self sovereignty.\n\nDrawbacks - To be a validator in the top 100 requires a minimum of about 200,000 ATOMs delegated at time of writing (about $3,000,000 USD). However, we believe that the ShapeShift DAO community can easily move past this barrier.\n\nVote - If you vote “for” this proposal you are voting to fund a total of 150,000 FOX that will be distributed to TaxiStake for transition and maintenance of a ShapeShift validator. 50,000 FOX immediately and 100,000 FOX in a Sablier contract for a 12-month period.\n\nIf you vote “against” you are saying you do not believe this Cosmos validator should move forward. Or maybe just not in this way.\n\nOriginal Forum Post: https://forum.shapeshift.com/t/operate-a-cosmos-validator-on-behalf-of-the-shapeshift-dao/392\n\nIdeation Post: \nhttps://app.boardroom.info/shapeshift/ideation/kjzl6cwe1jw148qumaq2r5iitbtx36u4z57p2l4xvtopwxtwnxp6dk90kjwx22x \n\n",

      "title": "[SCP-23] Official ShapeShift DAO Merchandise Store",
      "content": "Summary\n\nUncleDude (aka LoraxDude on Discord) is self-nominating to develop, deploy, and maintain the official ShapeShift Merchandise Store. Merchandise inventory will be curated and managed with regards to the needs/wants of the ShapeShift Community with the intention to drive brand awareness and loyalty of brand ambassadors.\n\nAbstract\n\nThis entails that the store would be set up for the community by an LLC owned and operated by UncleDude as the proprietor with a max $8,500 initial fund by the DAO to cover costs.\nThe site will be setup with all the basics of a responsive premium e-commerce store (customer support, email marketing, analytics, seo, etc.)\nAfter initial setup and the site is live, collaborations will be open between the DAO and LLC to empower and compensate community members/artists for their efforts in designing merch, with fair compensation made accordingly.\n\nMotivation\n\nMotivation stems from a lack of brand awareness through merch and growing demand for Shapeshift DAO members to be empowered as an ambassador of the DAO via merch.\n@jonisjon has also mentioned “in the early days of ShapeShift, people have loved the brand and wanted to rep gear.”\nPersonal motivation in building websites for communities and quality products that I truly believe people will appreciate and emit a sense of gratitude when repping the merch.\n\nSpecification\n\n• Any leftover funds from the initial deposit of FOX to cover initial costs, if not used, will be returned to the ShapeShift DAO.\n• All profits after costs will be split between the LLC and the DAO 50-50. Distributed on a monthly basis. 30 days from the initial day the store goes officially live.\n• Will hold an initial meeting within a week of funds being passed and then monthly meetings thereafter on discord (on the 2nd Wednesday at 2:30 pm pacific time - dates will be shared and listed) to gather feedback from the community on what products/designs/colors they would like to see on the store.\n• Site will be planned to go live at the end of 3 months from the first meeting held on discord for community feedback on products/designs preferences.\n• All brand/products logo in their highest quality files will be needed.\n• Initial merch will be composed of the following:\no t-shirts, sweatshirts, jackets, hats, socks, mugs, sunglasses, pins, stickers\n• Quality will be of the highest kind, given the price sensitivity of the community, to ensure products last for memories to come.\n• If possible, the site will be under a subdomain such as store.shapeshift.com or shop.shapeshift.com\n• Incorporate payment in crypto for FOX\n• Given the concern with privacy, if it is preferred by the community that analytics not be used, that is an option the Proprietor can accommodate.\n• Fair compensation will be expensed accordingly as royalties to member artists that created a design for a product. Sales for that specific product will be distributed on the monthly basis as mentioned previously. The artist will receive 40% profits after costs, split 3 ways with the DAO receiving 50%, and Proprietor receiving 10% for the given product.\n•\tProvide ShapeShift Starter Pack active contributors with t-shirts, a keepkey, stickers, and potentially printed DAO resources and/or a nice card with our values printed out (we used to have these at the office).\no\tWill coordinate with @danielle for KeepKeys sold on the Merch store and included in a ShapeShift Starter Pack\no\tCoordinate with @LPX and @graymachine on Info & Globalization workstream with help in determining what info (if any) to include. @meesh for any/all of ShapeShift’s onboarding docs for value card.\n•\tFunds over 3 months will be allocated accordingly:\no\t16% development of site (my time and trusted full stack if needed) $1,360\no\t84% to merchandise (what is not spent from this category will be returned to the DAO) $7,140\n•\tThe intent for the funds would be for hosting, time put into the site and curating which products over 3 months, manufactures and fulfillment providers for high quality products such as the ones listed above (not all mainly shirt and hoodies) if the profit margins are better than what we can get on printful or alike services. Potentially a trusted full stack contractor to support with incorporating FOX crypto payments if needed. Funds will also be allocated for starter pack packaging, printed resources, and fulfillment.\n•\tMy approach was to utilize connections with manufactures and fulfillment I have to curate a collection of high-quality merch (at the right price of course) for the shapeshift community. My intent is to setup the store for success by ensuring profit is being maximized and not being eaten away by easy high subscription costs, high payment processing fees, plug and play options with high cost per item for products that are frequently being purchased by the community.\n•\tI do also want to highlight that the full $8,500 in FOX isn’t intended to be fully spent. As I state in the proposal that funds not used will be returned to the DAO to reduce sell pressure on the token, not all tokens will be sold off immediately only on an as need basis.\n•\tIf need be, being assigned under a product workstream leader to ensure there is a check and balances as to how funds are being allocated over the next 3 months would definitely be appropriate.\n\n\n\nBenefits\n\n• New revenue stream for the DAO.\n• Increase Brand Awareness.\n• Increase DAO engagement through merch collaborations with the community.\n• Provide economic opportunities for contributing artists to be fairly compensated through the DAO Merch Store.\n\nDrawbacks\n\n• Clarifying expectations, the DAO collectively might have on how designs/products are appropriate to the community.\n• What transparency is required by the DAO for development, deployment, and Maintenance.\n• What involvement would the DAO like to have in the design of the site?\no If nothing is determined, the Proprietor will have creative control to begin with but will be happy to gather feedback after the site goes live to revamp accordingly to that feedback.\n• How might we need to consider splitting the profits from an LLC own and operated store to the DAO? Would a limited partnership be required or would be it considered a donation to the DAO or royalties or licensing expense for use of the Shapeshift brand?\n• Will the Proprietor be considered under a bounty or workstream leader?\n• How will the DAO and proprietor decide on approving artist work?\n",

      "title": "Proposal to Integrate Yat into Shapeshift Wallet",
      "content": "Motivation\nEmojis are a universal language. They are immensely popular in every country in the world, and on every social platform that exists. People send emojis to each other to play, tell stories, express emotions and connect. Part of the utility of Yat is focused on allowing people and companies to transmit value to each other. They simplify how users use digital currency systems, eliminate borders, cultural barriers, and have the potential to increase adoption for crypto as a whole. \n\nSummary\nThis proposal is for the integration of Yats as a preferred digital address system within Shapeshift wallet. Instead of users sending digital currency to complex hexadecimal addresses they could send it to examples like 👁❤️🍺 or 🦊👽🤠, or 💎🙌❤️ - whatever string of emojis users choose to best reflect their online identity. By being one of the first wallets to integrate Yats, Shapeshift will be able to dramatically simplify digital currency addresses within the wallet and eliminate the intimidation factor that often comes along with traditional hexadecimal addresses. More on Yats here: http://emojis.y.at\n\nAbstract\nThe integration would allow Yat owners within the Shapeshift wallet to map their digital currency addresses to their Yats. It would also allow for any Shapeshift users who are interested in creating their own Yats to do so from a prompt within the Shapeshift wallet. For those users that buy through Shapeshift, we are proposing a 25% revenue share. Concurrent with the launch of the integration, Yat Labs would launch support for Portis to make the integration as seamless as possible for the Shapeshift & Portis community. This will allow Yat users to mint their NFTs via Portis in addition to Metamask. \n\nSpecification\nThere would be a need for 1 project manager, 1 UX designer, and 1-2 engineers for the android and iOS versions depending on the engineers’ skillset across platforms. The integration would be considered complete once the following milestones are met:\n\n1. Delivery of the UX/UI designs to the community for a period of feedback. Including a link to our proposed user flows here. Note that these would be updated to include Portis support in addition to Metamask. These are designed to maximize adoption and thus the revenue share. This milestone will be considered complete once we achieve consensus on the user flows between the community and Yat Labs.\n\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1CoA0SuQBPyWi_Aw3GBxMVemLIhjGi1-U/view\n\n2. Delivery of the agreed-upon in-app designs on desktop and mobile from the design team. \nThis milestone will be considered complete once the design team submits final designs to the community and Yat Labs, both of which will have to sign off before dev work is to commence.\n\n3. Delivery of the integration in the mobile wallet on IOS and Android. \nThis milestone will be considered complete when engineering signs off on the code, the product team signs off on functionality, and Yat Labs completes full QA testing.\n\n4. Delivery of Portis support by Yat Labs. \nThis milestone would be considered complete upon the successful delivery and QA testing by Yat Labs as confirmed by members of the DAO.\n\nTo incentivize the work necessary to complete the integration, we are offering a bounty of $60,000 in FOX tokens for the PM to distribute to the team accordingly.\n\nBenefits\nIn addition to the 25% revenue share on the sale of Yats that come from Shapeshift wallet users, being one of the first wallets to integrate Yats will eliminate the intimidation factor that comes with current digital addresses. This would remove a critical the barrier to the mass adoption of digital currencies, positioning Shapeshift as one of the easiest to use wallets for both crypto savvy and new crypto users.\n\nDrawbacks\nThe major potential drawback is that time and resources get invested in the integration, and nobody uses it. That said, it’s worth considering that in ~7 months, we have sold close to 200,000 Yats, and have hundreds of influencers and big-name artists and investors like Paris Hilton, 888, Steve Cohen, Steve Aoki, Disclosure, G-Eazy, Lil Way (to name a few) with a total follower count of over 500 Million, so this risk is low. We can also mitigate this risk by developing a co-marketing plan announcing the launch of the integration. In any case, there is little financial risk to the DAO as Yat is offering a bounty to cover the integration costs.",

Although not every one has a title of “Senior” or higher, each one of us has multiple years (or decades) of professional development experience and is a high-performing engineer, as measured by their peers, both inside and outside the company.\n\nFollowing precedence from other workstreams, salary includes $30k per year per stream worker for benefits and additional fees incurred with self-employment status. The budget increases in January are due to the fact that some of the core dev members will be paid salaries by ShapeShift, Inc until Dec 31 and become included in this budget beginning Jan 1.\n\nAt this time, the Engineering Workstream will not be managing the accounts or charges for any infrastructure and tooling, thus the budget being presented is primarily for salary. Contingency is included to cover unknown costs. Any amount remaining at the end of the budget cycle that is not spent will be sent back to the DAO treasury no later than March 15th.\n\nIf the contingency is not needed for other purposes, it is the hope that funds will be used for a workstream “onsite” meeting, where everyone is gathered in the same physical space for a few days of work and fun.\n\nSalaries are designated in $USD, to be paid in FOX on the 15th of every month. Engineering Workstream Leader will work with the DAO treasury to get funds on a regular basis to cover payroll in a timely manner. Because the budget is denominated in $USD and FOX is a volatile asset, any decreases in the price of FOX will warrant additional transfers of FOX from the DAO to the Engineering Workstream to ensure the workstream has enough FOX to cover its budget.\n\nFor transparency, report of budgeted vs actual will be provided after 2 months, and at end of this cycle.\n\nVote:\nA “Yes” vote causes this funding to be allocated monthly to the Engineering Workstream. The Colony platform will be the preferred method for this allocation.\nA “No” vote causes no action to be taken.",

      "title": "[SCP-25] Launch bonds for FOX-ETH Liquidity",
      "content": "### Summary\nBuild on the recent FOX liquidity mining extension and implement a bond program for the DAO to own its own liquidity. Protocol-owned-liquidity is the future of liquidity incentive programs.\n### Motivation\nIncentivizing liquidity provision is a balancing act for protocols seeking to distribute their governance token, between high inflation and low liquidity depth. The extension of liquidity mining incentives will be an excellent tool to distribute FOX to community members providing liquidity. However, the emissions rate may continue to have a negative impact on token price as farmers compound their rewards. By implementing a bond program for FOX-ETH liquidity, ShapeShift can distribute its governance tokens to more users while also accumulating its own liquidity.\n### Abstract\nAs of the time of writing, FOX has $23M in liquidity on Uniswap in the FOX-ETH pool. The recent liquidity mining extension will have the following impact, assuming constant liquidity at $23M:\n* Original reward rate: 175,200 FOX per day (~125% APR)\n* New reward rate: 117,384 FOX per day (~85% APR)\n* Reward savings: 57,816 FOX per day (~$26k)\n\nOne of the risks mentioned in the reward rate reduction proposal is a reduction in total liquidity, as mercenary capital rotates into higher-earning farms. A bond program may help offset this loss of liquidity, as users rotate out of their LP positions via bonding for FOX instead of withdrawing liquidity. Additionally, the bond program may attract new capital and provide fresh liquidity.\n\nThe proposed bond program would sell FOX at a discount in exchange for FOX/ETH LP tokens. Current liquidity mining programs essentially reward liquidity providers with FOX in exchange for temporary liquidity, which exposes those providers to impermanent loss from fluctuations in the underlying assets. Bonds allow active users to stack FOX tokens at a discount while removing the exposure to IL. The discount rate on bonds is achieved by a novel pricing mechanism that allows the market to set the discount. Basically, bond prices are decreased until a bond is purchased which then pushes up the price of the next bond. For reference, here is the average discount of Olympus’ bonds with their extremely high APY.\n##\n### Proposed Bond Program:\nFOX bonds would be offered with a week-long vesting period, which helps prevent immediate price impact from discounted tokens. This aligns the goals of the protocol with those of bond participants. Typically, higher bond volume is seen when users expect the price of the token to increase during the vesting period.\n\n#### Proposal\nAllocate half of reward savings (28,908 FOX per day) to target $1.5M of liquidity over the new reward program duration, end of February 2022.\n\n**Total FOX Budget for Bond Program:**  3,902,580 FOX\n\n#### Success criteria\n* Discount rate < 10% on bonded FOX\n* Minimal impact on FOX price\n#### Benefits\n* Permanent liquidity source\n* Increased treasury value from liquidity that also earns trading fees\n* Exposure to paired asset in liquidity pool (ETH)\n* ShapeShift can stake its LP tokens to provide additional runway for incentive programs\n#### Risks\n* Additional FOX emissions via bonds may increase sell pressure, but should be reduced in comparison to current reward rate (prior to October 13th)\n* Protocol-owned-liquidity can be seen as diluting existing LP holders",

My goal has been and will continue to be, disseminating my knowledge of ShapeShift products and culture and my support management skills to other team members. The ultimate goal is to DAO myself out of a full time role and ultimately become an advisor that future leaders can call upon for advice in the future.\n\n**Specification** - The main goals of my role can be found outlined here in the job description: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1a4_sMA81xnLnbBk-6HcDNjZgtterOWh2qZmElM35k7E/edit \n\n**Benefits** - My longstanding tenure with ShapeShift proves my track record of trustworthiness and competence in the role of a customer support leader. \n\n**Special Goals**\n\n**Director to Advisor:**\n\nAs a longstanding member and leader of the Customer Support Team at ShapeShift, I have become a central, informational point of failure. My goal has been and will continue to be, disseminating my knowledge of ShapeShift products and culture and my support management skills to other team members. The ultimate goal is to DAO myself out of a full time role and ultimately become an advisor that future leaders can call upon for advice in the future.\n\n**How do I plan on achieving this?**\n\nThrough the staffing I have prepared in the funding proposal, I will set into motion a transfer of responsibilities to 4 new leaders: DQA Manager, Helpdesk Manager, and the Support Agent Managers. This will decentralize the knowledge and diversify the style of workstream management moving forward.\n\nWhile I’d like to see our funding proposals renewed every 4 months (this timeline is up for discussion), I’d also like to see a decrease in my scope and salary with each renewal. The decrease will be determined by goals hit individually and cumulatively by the Support Leadership Team.\n\nUltimately, I want to be a resource for as long as I’m relevant.\n\n**WHY? Why would I want to DAO myself out of a job? 2 reasons….**\n\n1. It’s in the spirit of the DAO. In fact, it was in the spirit of a centralized role as well. It’s just more plausible within the DAO to make the goal a reality because of less red tape and complacency.\n2. My personal goal is to focus more on the FOX governance model as well as a personal aspiration of epic motherhood and nutrition counseling.\n\nNo funding required for this proposal. Funding for the role is included in the funding proposal which is coming up next!\n\n**Drawbacks** - None that I can see! :) \n\n**Vote** - \n\nPlease vote \"Yassss\" for @cryptohmeg to become the Customer Support Workstream Leader. \n\nPlease vote \"no\" if you do not want @cryptohmeg as the Workstream Leader or would like changes to the proposal.",

      "content": "Shall a Security Workstream be created and Reid Rankin assigned as its initial leader?\n\n# Summary\n\n## Why should people use this workstream? What is it for?\n\nThe Security Workstream will be primarily be responsible for providing security review of sensitive code, advising on appropriate standards for the protection of sensitive information, and coordinating penetration tests, audits, and incident response.\n\nThe Security Workstream will also be available to host security-related proposals generally, and to act as a delegation point for special projects or bounty funds that may be approved for security-specific efforts.\n\n# Abstract\n\n## What is the mission of this workstream?\n\nTo provide a robust and responsible resource for addressing critical issues, be a source for security information for all Foxes, and ensure the trustability of the ShapeShift ecosystem and its code.\n\n# Motivation\n\n## How exactly is this different than the other categories we already have?\n\nWhile this workstream will have some of its own engineering resources to draw upon, no other workstream currently focuses specifically on security issues. A DAO is by its very nature is exposed to a lot of technical risk, many of which can trigger more rapidly than a DAO’s native governance cycle can handle. Incident response requires a group of knowledgeable security engineers that the community trusts to act as a contact point and coordinate sensitive tasks effectively, and having a formal Security workstream already set up ahead of time helps accomplish that goal.\n\n\n# Specification\n\n## What are the goals of this workstream?\n\n- Provide architecture and code review from an attacker mindset\n- Audit smart contract code, both internal and that of potential partners\n- Advise on appropriate standards for the protection of sensitive information\n- Verify sensitive processes to assure no hanky-panky is involved (i.e. airdrop eligibility lists)\n- Sponsor active penetration tests\n- Coordinate vulnerability disclosures and incident response\n- Help protect Foxes against cyberattacks and scams\n- Champion secure coding practices and a high standard of code quality\n- Issue appropriate security advisories\n- Evaluate and advise the community on the security impact of all newly posted proposals\n\nIn addition, as ShapeShift US winds down, its Responsible Disclosure Program (RDP) will be going with it. The Security Workstream will have the responsibility to design a proposal for the DAO’s own bug bounty program to take its place.\n\nShapeShift US also currently provides an on-call rotation for timely handling of incident reporting and response, and the Security Workstream will continue this service after the centralized entity winds it down.\n\n## What metrics can this workstream’s success be measured against?\n\n- Number of successful attacks against the ShapeShift ecosystem\n- Number and type of threats mitigated\n- Number of security reviews completed\n- Time-to-resolution of reported security issues\n\n## Dependencies on other Workstreams\n\nThe Security Workstream will work closely with the Engineering Workstream, both in development of net-new code and in coordination of vulnerability fixes for existing code, and will coordinate with the Customer Support Workstream to handle both security issues reported as support requests and support requests reported as security issues.\n\nAdditionally, the Security Workstream will have the responsibility to evaluate ongoing threats; in the event of an emergency, it will have the responsibility to coordinate appropriate emergency measures with other workstreams (especially Engineering and Operations).\n\n## Will your workstream hold recurring meetings?\n\nThis workstream will hold regular public “office hours” to answer questions and solicit community input. Exact dates and times will be arranged via a public calendar poll and announced on the forum and Discord.\n\n## Workstream Funding\n\nNo funding is requested at this stage; going forward, individual proposals will be brought at a later stage to fund specific initiatives, including any personnel requirements, and containing performance standards as applicable.\n\n(For context, ShapeShift US’s Security department operates on a budget in the 5-figure-per-month range. The Security Workstream will likely have somewhat less in the way of systems expenses and somewhat more in the way of people expenses, but hopefully this is useful at least as a ballpark figure so that voters know what they’re getting into.)\n\n## Workstream Leadership\n\nI’m Reid Rankin (@MrNerdHair), a Software Security Engineer in the current ShapeShift US Security department. In light of the positive feedback received so far on the forum, I’d like to volunteer to be the initial workstream leader.\n\nIt’s important that this workstream have a group of knowledgeable security engineers that the community trusts to coordinate sensitive tasks effectively, and a degree of continuity with the existing centralized infrastructure should help enable that trust. And while I can’t speak directly for my Security colleagues, I do believe that several of them will be joining us on this exciting but uncertain decentralized voyage, and I expect that they may also find their natural place in this workstream.\n\nI’ll be leaving ShapeShift US’s employment at the end of the year. While I’m still on their payroll, I don’t intend to ask to be compensated for this role; afterwards, however, I do anticipate it being a paid position.

      "title": "Fairdrop (follow up airdrop) to DAO communities who were missed due to staking or LPing",
      "content": "**Summary**\nAirdrop up to 6,613,000 FOX Tokens to 33,065 token holders of the original list of 13 DAO communities who were missed due to staking or LPing.\n\n**Abstract**\nIn the original FOX airdrop that was announced on July 15, 2021 and is still ongoing, 200 FOX was rewarded to 123,827 DAO community members for a total of 24,765,400 FOX. These DAO community members were identified by holding at least $1,500 of one or more of 13 governance tokens listed below during a snapshot taken at block 12597000 on June 9th, 2021. Unfortunately, as many quickly pointed out, any token holders who were staking or LPing their tokens were missed in this snapshot and did not receive the 200 FOX airdrop.\n\nWe’ve now compiled the list of token holders who were staking or providing liquidity during the snapshot, and FOX Token holders can now vote to approve a follow up airdrop (aka Fairdrop) to reward these community members and encourage them to join and support the ShapeShift ecosystem.\n\nFortunately, the vast majority of the development work necessary to enact this has already been completed, including compiling the lists of eligible addresses. Furthermore, the existing mobile and web UI can be utilized without any changes, and the same contracts and deployment script used for the original airdrop can be reused with the new list, so the overall development effort required is quite low.\n\nThis proposal also requests 2000 FOX (current estimate, subject to change in ideation) to pay the security workstream to audit the list and confirm the intended, and only the intended addresses are included.\n\n**Motivation & Benefits**\nThe idea for this proposal was suggested by several community members and Twitter followers, many of whom were missed in the original drop. These are addresses we wanted to include in the original list, but with the thousand other things we were scrambling to get ready for launch, we settled knowing we could always follow up with a proposal to the DAO. This is that proposal!\n\nEach of the DAOs included in the list are among the first pioneering DAOs that we are either already partnered/affiliated with, would like to partner/affiliate with, or are inspired and empowered by. In our quest to be one of the top DAOs and decentralize our governance to the community of crypto users, I believe it will be beneficial to airdrop a small amount of FOX Tokens (200) to each address on the list as tribute, good faith, and to encourage them to join or support us.\n\n**Specification**\nThere are 33,065 unique addresses included in the new list, each of which would be eligible to claim 200 FOX if this proposal passes (up to 6,613,000 FOX in total).\n\nIf this proposal passes, a copy of the same merkle proof smart contract used in ShapeShift’s original airdrop will be deployed awarding these 33,065 unique addresses with 200 FOX each. This contract will be connected to the existing airdrop claim UIs on web and mobile and eligible addresses will have ~30 days to claim their airdrop before the claimable amount begins decreasing 10% per day.\n\nA significant amount of FOX will inevitably go unclaimed and can be transferred to the DAO’s Treasury along with the unclaimed FOX from the original airdrop on Oct 23, 2021. Furthermore, the airdrop contract doesn’t need to be funded 100% up front and can be topped off as it’s drained.\n\nThe list was generated by @mcchadwick using open-source code and public API endpoints along with input from the community on which staking and LP contracts to include. We did our best to ensure as many addresses were included as possible, although unfortunately were not able to include any Uniswap v3 liquidity pools due to how much differently their LP tokens function relative to the other AMM DEXs. Furthermore, any addresses that were already included in the original airdrop were not included in this follow up airdrop as it would have caused complications in using the same UIs and added a large amount of scope.\n\nWe welcome any review and feedback on the list before the proposal passes and the contract is funded.\n\n[**List of eligible addresses**](https://github.com/mcchadwick/shapeshift-airdrop-merkle)\n\n[**Details of how the list was generated and which staking contracts and liquidity pools were used**](https://github.com/shapeshift/airdrop-merkle/issues/1)\n\n**Funds requested**\nTotal: up to 6,625,000 FOX\n\n- 6,613,000 FOX up to this amount can be claimed by eligible airdrop recipients\n- 5,000 FOX to cover creation of the address list (the work for this has already been completed and $1000+ has already been spent out of pocket)\n- 2,000 FOX to cover an audit of the list by the security workstream (current estimate, subject to change during ideation phase)\n- 5,000 FOX to cover the development expenses, including generating the Merkle tree, updating the original airdrop contract with the new dates and addresses, deploying the airdrop contract, and wiring the new airdrop contract into the existing mobile, beta.shapeshift.com, and fox.shapeshift.com UI/UX for claiming.\n- Up to 5,000 FOX to cover the gas costs for deploying the contract. Any unused FOX will be returned to the DAO's treasury.\n\n**Drawbacks**\nThis proposal is requesting a significant amount of FOX from the Treasury to essentially give it away. There is no guarantee any recipients of this airdrop will add any meaningful value to the ShapeShift ecosystem.\n",

      "content": "Link to forums for Easy Reading: https://forum.shapeshift.com/t/proposing-the-marketing-growth-workstream/415/11?u=petecoin\n\nWhy should people use this workstream? What is it for?\n\nThe Marketing + Growth Workstream has set these goals for the first 4 months of it’s existance:\n\n1) Creating a framework for community members to propose marketing initiatives in return for bounties paid in FOX\n2) Activating ShapeShift Users through Email, Social Media Management, and Community Building.\n3) Representing the ShapeShift DAO publicly, attracting users and talent to the DAO in order to increase its operational capacity.\n4) Engaging current ShapeShift users through promotions, giveaways, value adds, etc.\nContinue storytelling product releases, as they have shown to be the most effective growth catalysts.\n\n\nAre you applying to lead this workstream?\n\nYes, @PeteCoin is applying to lead this workstream\n\nHow exactly is this different than the other categories we already have?\n\nThis workstream is intended to be the most accessible workstream for the DAO. We envision a world where anyone can have an idea, propose it to the workstream, and if it’s valuable to the community - they’re empowered to execute and are paid.\n\nThat’s an oversimplification of a large process that still needs to be designed and implemented, but it will be the first major goal of this workstream - alongside maintaining our social presence and establishing / growing satellite communities, and hiring contributors.\n\nYou may have questions - what does this really mean? What does it look like? Could you show us your graphic design qualifications?\n\nThe answers are simple: 1) we’re going to collaborate with you all to design it. 2+3) avert your eyes if you’re an art snob:\n\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1XDM3sZxwxSkbjtbzJ9MJaca3goTrcs3T/view?usp=sharing\n\nWhat is the mission of this workstream?\n\nTo tell the story of the ShapeShift DAO, and use that catalyst to grow. To empower users to propose and execute beneficial marketing and growth efforts for the DAO and be compensated for it.\n\nWhat are the goals of this workstream?\n\n1) Grow our Twitter follower count by 5% per month\n2) Establish satellite communities across the web, such as on Reddit, with the goal of growing those communities by 7.5% month over month, and always providing a pipeline to the ShapeShift forums and discord.\n3) Create a system where users can propose marketing efforts, have those proposals vetted, track those efforts, and pay the contributors.\n4) Increase the monthly active holder retention by 1-2% Quarterly\n5) 2-5% increase in 6 month retention rate levels\n6) 15% increase in MAU Mom (blended quarterly)\n7) To provide to the community overall metrics tracking important ShapeShift DAO growth. Including, but not limited to this spreadsheet 1.\n8) Create a framework for tracking AIO and TLV in this DAO world, and showing that AIO taking advantage of product offerings - including, but not limited to LP’ing, Yield Farming, etc.\n\n\nWhat metrics can this workstream’s success be measured against?\n\nDid a DAO Marketing Proposal Process get created?\nDid we grow community / follower count?\nHow many marketing proposals were accepted, funded, executed, tracked, and reported back to the DAO?\nAre we focused on the right growth metrics for ShapeShift? Did those metrics improve?\nThese success metrics need to be further defined by the workstream, and the DAO at large. We look forward to collaborating to complete that process.\n\nInitially, the M+G Workstream’s current best thinking is that we would like to align our efforts and ultimately our tracked metrics to this philosophy:\n\n“If we were to take an approach of opening up our systems to any and all wallets possible, and then provide yield generating opportunities for users, our growth strategy is clear. Users are attracted and easily retained by not asking them to switch wallets or import seed phrases, and we solve the fractured nature of yield farming by becoming essentially a SSO for web3 defi. All the while, we’re generating revenues for the DAO, and M+G is focused on activating users into those mutually beneficial relationships through email, social media, and community engagement. The user sees number go up, we see revenues go up, we all win.”\n\nThis would result in tracking, at minimum:\n\n- Wallets Connected\n- Assets in Orbit (AIO)\n- Total Locked Value of those assets (TLV)\n- Rate of activation to those yield generating opportunities\n- Revenue generated for the DAO\n\nWhat should topics in this category generally contain?\n\n- Growth and Marketing\n- One-off and Ongoing Promotions\n- Community Building & Management\n\nDo we need this category? Can we merge with another category, or subcategory?\n\nYes, and I don’t think it can merge with another. However, if another workstream desires a partnership with this one, and feels that M+G can provide material benefit to them, we are happy to help.\n\nWill your workstream hold recurring meetings?\n\nYes, there will be a weekly internal standup required for full time members, and part time members are encouraged to attend. Also, there will be a bi-weekly public meeting for the DAO at large.\n\nThis is subject to change - I could easily see a weekly brainstorm meeting for the DAO at large. Where DAO members can come and pitch ideas, we all sharpen those ideas, and then look to execute them.",

      "title": "Proposal to fund the Marketing + Growth Workstream through December 2021",
      "content": "Hello!\n\nGetting the Marketing + Growth Workstream funded will allow the team, and ultimately contributors to get involved with growing the DAO as soon as possible. This is a proposal to fund the Marketing + Growth Workstream’s anticipated budget until December 2021. For the proposal to establish the workstream, see here: https://forum.shapeshift.com/t/proposing-the-marketing-growth-workstream/415/11\n\nHere is the link for the Marketing + Growth Workstream Kickoff call on 8/18/2021: https://vimeo.com/589043364\n\nHere are the slides from the kickoff call. Please note that the structure has changed significantly due to DAO suggestions - please read the first link for details. The DAO works: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1u36Ou_5k3E7zfgqTBHEb1zwwVF3vHyxXFrJBH0M-5CM/edit#slide=id.ge48ff8efd6_0_616\n\nRequested Funding:\n\n$298,092\n\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1zjTQVHBXMXoFSBTpsjTsBEO2wY0d1wYk/view?usp=sharing\n\nBudget:\n\nThe budget is designed with these conditions in mind:\n\nAny unused funds at the end of the 4 month timeframe will be returned to the DAO with a report released to the community that details where all funds were sent and spent. No funding will be rolled over into the subsequent 4 month marketing period, so that the risk to the DAO of a budget ballooning is mitigated completely. There is now essentially no risk to funding the M+G Workstream, as any unused funds will be promptly returned to the DAO and funding reapplied for.\n\nThis workstream intends to benefit from a global talent pool. Current best thinking is that we should hire the most talented individual for every role. Someone in Barcelona could be just as qualified to perform Email Marketing as someone in California, and may cost half the price - which would ultimately make more funding available to the larger DAO community to accomplish projects. This is expressed by grouping all salaries into a bucket instead of by role, every applicant for a full time position can propose a salary that they feel is fair for their contributions. This also represents the MAX CAP for full time salaries. No salary that would push the total figure above the $47,417 requested will be accepted without an amended request to the DAO.\n\nThe M+G Workstream will not artificially inflate any salary to utilize the full budget.\n\nAny unused funding earmarked for salary will be rolled over into the bounty pool, and available for the community to propose projects against. The intent is to move as much funding into the Bounties / DAO Contributor Rewards line item. Then, the funding follows rule #1 above.\n\nA note that @huntthewick asked me to pass on. He feels uncomfortable accepting 2 salaried positions, and thus he will be renouncing his previous funding granted by the CMod workstream, and his salary will be fully paid out of the M+G Workstream. He will continue to work his CMod function alongside @giantkin for an indeterminate amount of time, since his responsibilities overlap nicely with CMod responsibilities.\n\nThe previous proposal by @huntthewick to fund Community Structure / Support will be absorbed by this workstream. It will not move to voting, and those tasks will be completed in this workstream. Check it out here for details.\n\nOnce established, the marketing + growth workstream will have three full time contributors:\n\nWorkstream Leader - @PeteCoin\nDirector of Growth Marketing - @Toasty\nCommunity Growth Manager - @huntthewick\nEmail Marketing / Copywriter - Open Position\nJob description for the open role to be released shortly after the workstream is voted on and accepted, as well as funded.\n\nReasoning: Why is this structure being proposed?\n\nFirst, Read this Link: https://forum.shapeshift.com/t/proposing-the-marketing-growth-workstream/415/11\n\nSecond, check out the dataset we’re going to be using to track results: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-W8-XsGQcuwv8MuNRnmqBOxha7_hEHmQcoSxJ8CvlaM/edit#gid=534785285\n\nEssentially, I reviewed the data in the second link with a goal of: “How can we continue to maintain channels that showed strong metrics previously, that also fit into a DAO structure?”\n\nThis structure is defined as: 1) can be paid for in crypto 2) recognizes the value of the ShapeShift brand and leverages it for the benefit of the DAO - and by maintaining that leverage may grow the brand. 3) is inherently collaborative, human driven, and lends itself to the philosophy described in link one. (Product-led growth, AIO/TLV focus, community growth and empowerment, being the SSO for all web3 defi and deliver mutually beneficial yield opportunities to our users)\n\nThe channels that stood out, that met the above criteria are:\n\nSocial Media Marketing\nCommunity / Affiliate / Referral Marketing\nEmail Marketing, with a focus on user retention / activation\nPR - which @lindsaylou is crushing and will continue to crush for months to come.\nFurthermore, its clear to me that Product-Led is the correct path, because the data shows extremely strong correlation, if not outright statistical significance, when we track results to product launches.\nSee for yourself in the link above regarding dataset.\n\nJuly 2021: we launch the DAO, we have the most MAU ever recorded since I started. Once the hype begins to taper, metrics go right back to baselines.\nJanuary 2021: we integrate 0x and other DEX aggregators into the app, second highest MAU ever recoded. Taper back to baseline in the 3 months afterward.\nJuly/August 2020: we launch the ShapeShift Mobile App, and make self custody f*cking easy. MAU pops and follows the trend to baseline.\nI believe that being product-led, and continuing to tell the story of how ShapeShift is a DAO that is actually accomplishing a ton of work, and the community is a huge part of that is going to be a key factor to continued success.",

During discussion/ideation there was no interest in increasing rewards, so this proposal focuses on reduction.\n\n**Motivation:** Incentivizing Liquidity Providers (LP's) through farms at this stage of the project is still important because FOX does not yet have a broad centralized exchange presence. A broad centralized exchange presence carries several benefits:\n\n- More liquidity to buy/sell against (deeper depth)\n- More locations to buy/sell\n- More daily volume due to arbitrage options between exchanges\n- More exposure\n\nThrough incentives for LPs, FOX is able to bridge the gap regarding most of these benefits without the immediate need for centralized exchange listings. For now, we want to focus on the first item, liquidity.\n\n**Abtract:** As mentioned earlier, FOX has $23.5 million of liquidity on Uniswap. When determining liquidity provider rewards, it's important to consider how it will affect the total quantity of LP. A reduction in LP rewards will almost always result in a reduction in total LP. As LP's review their positions and the rates of return on the pools they're providing liquidity in, they move their liquidity in order to obtain the best rewards with the least amount of risk possible. Due to this, it's important to carefully consider any changes to rewards as they could have a negative effect on total liquidity. Since FOX is currently not listed on any large centralized exchanges, a sudden loss of liquidity would be damaging.\n\nA 50% reduction (for example) of LP rewards, could result in a 50% reduction in total liquidity provided. In reality, the reduction is usually less than the rewards reduction due to several factors:\n\n- Dedicated holders will take any reward, at any risk, because they are so dedicated\n- LPs may forget they're providing LP, so it will just stay provided through thick and thin\n- LPs may be speculating that the coin price will increase, so they will continue to provide LP at lower rewards\n\nSince FOX has only provided one series of LP rewards, we only have a single data point to look at for this specific project. This does leave us in a position where we're making an educated decision based on minimal data points, but there is no way around this at the current state of the project. If this proposal passes we will obtain a second data point to use for future LP reward forecasting and decision-making. That should lead to more accurate decisions in the future.\n\nThrough input from several members of the community, and based on additional polling, the majority of the community appears to support a reduction of farming rewards by 33%. Current farm rewards are 175,200 FOX per day (15,768,000 FOX spread over 90 days).\n\nSimilarly, several members of the community discussed and polled during the discussion/ideation phase indicated support for an extension of farming for a period of 9 months. After further discussion, it was determined treasury does not have enough FOX to support this spend currently, so the proposal is to chop the period in half and go with a 4.5 month farm duration.\n\nThis results in a new daily FOX expenditure of 117,384, with a total FOX expenditure of 15,846,840 for farming.\n\n**Math**\n\nCurrent daily FOX farm rewards: 175,200 FOX\nProposed reduction: 33%\nNew daily FOX = 175200 * .67 = **117,384 FOX**\nProposed timeframe: 4.5 months (135 days)\nFarming FOX Required = 135 * 117384 = **15,846,840 FOX**\n\nAn additional 35,000 FOX will be allocated to FOX developers in order to create, audit, deploy, and configure the next staking rewards contract.\n\nTotal Fox Required = 15846840 + 35000 = **15,881,840 FOX**\n\n**Benefits**\n\n- FOX maintains adequate liquidity for market participants to trade against on Uniswap V2\n- FOX continues to gain investors and attention driven by liquidity and volume on Uniswap V2\n- FOX avoids a potentially damaging drop in liquidity suddenly, should rewards completely expire\n\n**Drawbacks**\n\n- It is a large quantity of FOX\n\nNOTE: If the FOX is not needed for engineering to deploy the contract, it will be returned to the DAO.\n\n**Vote**\n\nFor - Extend FOX LP rewards for a period of 4.5 months with a total of 15,881,840 FOX, at a rate of 117,384 FOX per day, including 35,000 FOX to set up the farm.\n\nAgainst - Do not extend FOX LP rewards at this time.",

      "content": " \nAbstract The Operations workstream is an integral part of the growth and development of healthy systems for reliably producing and maintaining the ShapeShift product suite and its uptime, responsiveness and feature functionality. This workstream will provide a number or resources to the DAO including: Prod Issue, and Triage escalation management, regression and deployment testing, and a resource for cross workstream organization and alignment. Check out more about each specific responsibility outlined in the ideation post.  This is a proposal to officially establish the Operations Workstream, fund the workstream’s anticipated budget through January 2022, and appoint @Tyler | ShapeShift as the workstream’s leader.\n \nMotivation The Operations workstream works side by side with all the other workstreams to increase efficiency and help progress deployment and testing processes while still verifying reliability, health, and full functionality of all of our services. This allows the Engineering workstream to spend more time building, and deploying, the Product workstream to spend more time scoping, designing, and implementing, and can provide updates, resources, communication, coordination and any other need that may arise from other workstreams.\nThe Operations workstream is the only workstream focused on the wider picture of the product suite’s uptime, functionality, and overall health. This workstream accomplishes that by also being a workstream that synergizes and coordinates cross stream collaboration further strengthening the DAO.\n \nSpecification Mission: The Operations workstream is an integral part of the growth and development of healthy systems for reliably producing and maintaining the ShapeShift product suite and its uptime, responsiveness and feature functionality.\nGoals\nMinimize downtime of the entire product suite.\nCatch production environment bugs, triage and prioritize them accordingly.\nIdentify Production Issue level bugs in regression tests.\nMonitor and measure down time, length of bugs and solutions, and maintenance ticket progress.\nOrganize cross stream communication\n \nEnsure the delivery of prioritized features on time, under budget, and according to the acceptance criteria defined in each feature spec\nAssist with one-off community projects as needed, and make sure all projects executed by the workstream and outside the workstream are on brand and pass usability\nOptimize efficiency wherever possible. \nSuccess Metrics\nWe will develop a strong set of KPIs after the first quarter of the workstream’s existence. Metrics we will be focusing on are: Site uptime, number of triage tickets made/solved, number of production issue escalations, length of time spent fighting production bugs, release timelines, feature functionality, time spent testing as well as more DAO focused and centered KPIs relating to organization for the community, meeting attendance, and governance processes,\n \n \nBudget Total Funds Requested $136,400 detailed budget outlined in Operations workstream forum post. \nIf this proposal passes, the equivalent amount of FOX will be transferred from the DAO’s treasury to the Operations Workstream on Colony. Because the budget is denominated in $USD and FOX is a volatile asset, any decreases in FOX price will warrant additional transfers of FOX from the DAO to the Operation Workstream on Colony to ensure the workstream has enough FOX to cover its budget.\nBenefits If this proposal passes, the DAO will receive the following specific deliverables and services which are integral to its success:.\nCoverage for Prod Issue escalations\nTriage Management\nRegularly scheduled regression and deployment testing\nCross workstream alignment and stakeholder resources\nDrawbacks The main potential risk is whether cost/benefit of a Operations workstream will be worth it to the DAO’s bottom-line in the long term. To mitigate this risk, only 3-4 months of funding are being requested, the funds will be managed on Colony and can be revoked by the DAO in any worst-case-scenario.\nVote Yes: You support establishing the Operations Workstream, appointing @Tyler | ShapeShift as workstream leader, and funding the workstream’s anticipated budget through January 2022 of $136,400. If this proposal passes, the equivalent amount of FOX will be transferred from the DAO’s treasury to the Operations Workstream on Colony.\nNo: You do not support establishing or funding the Operations workstream.\n",

      "content": "**Abstract**\nAs a product-centric DAO, a well-resourced Product Workstream is vital to our success. The Workstream will be accountable for a number of activities which are critical to the DAO’s ability to delight users, grow the FOX ecosystem, and achieve its mission. This is a proposal to officially establish the Product Workstream, fund the workstream’s anticipated budget through December 2021, and appoint @CAO as the workstream’s interim leader.\n\nFor a video version of this proposal, check out the [recording](https://vimeo.com/587930416) or the [slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1v0yHDclkMYAOAtpTxMcYIrj3nWs_ujTHhkrY9k2k14c/edit?usp=sharing) from the Product Workstream Kickoff call on 8/16/2021.\n\n\n**Motivation**\nShapeShift is fortunate to have a talented and experienced Product & UX Design team, many of which have worked happily together for several years. The team is excited about the transition to a DAO and interested in continuing to invest their energy into ShapeShift’s products full time. They’re also excited about breaking down the borders between themselves and the community, inviting members of the community that are interested in contributing to apply to contribute full time, as-needed, or informally. Funding this workstream will ensure that the ShapeShift DAO can retain the extraordinary talent that ShapeShift has already scouted and cultivated while also ensuring the team can expand and fulfill the growing product and UX needs that ShapeShift’s product development demands.\n\n**Specification**\nMission Design and execute the optimal product roadmap for achieving the mission and goals of the ShapeShift DAO.\n\n**Goals**\n1. Curate and propose a product roadmap based on research, user feedback and behavior, and informed vision that aligns with the mission and goals of the ShapeShift DAO\n2. Provide feature specifications (including goals and success metrics), UI/UX designs, project management, and applicable front-end development for all features prioritized by the ShapeShift DAO\n3. Represent the ShapeShift DAO’s product suite, roadmap, and workstream and act as a repository of knowledge\n4. Ensure the delivery of prioritized features on time, under budget, and according to the acceptance criteria defined in each feature spec\n5. Assist with one-off community projects as needed, and make sure all projects executed by the workstream and outside the workstream are on brand and pass usability\n\n**Success Metrics**\n1. Define and propose a roadmap that is accepted and funded by the community\n2. Features on the roadmap are delivered on time, on or under budget, and according to the acceptance criteria defined in each feature spec\n3. The KPIs specified in each feature are tracked and reported to the community\n4. Growth in DAO revenues\n\n**Budget**\nTotal Funds Requested $338,478\n[Detailed budget](https://forum.shapeshift.com/t/proposal-to-fund-the-product-workstream-through-december-2021/402/18?u=willy)\n\nIf this proposal passes, the equivalent amount of FOX will be transferred from the DAO’s treasury to the Product Workstream on Colony. Because the budget is denominated in $USD and FOX is a volatile asset, any decreases in FOX price will warrant additional transfers of FOX from the DAO to the Product Workstream on Colony to ensure the workstream has enough FOX to cover its budget.\n\n**Benefits**\nIf this proposal passes, the DAO will receive the following specific deliverables and services which are integral to its success:\n\nProposed feature roadmap encompassing the following products the DAO: ShapeShift Mobile, current web app (beta.shapeshift.com), new open-source web app, shapeshift.com, and other products the ShapeShift DAO launches\nFeature specs for prioritized feature including goals, success metrics, and acceptance criteria\nUI/UX designs for each prioritized feature\nFront-end development where applicable\nReporting on product KPIs and feature success metrics\n\n**Drawbacks**\nThe main potential risk is whether cost/benefit of a product workstream will be worth it to the DAO’s bottom-line in the long term. To mitigate this risk, only 4 months of funding are being requested, the product workstream will continue delivering early and regularly, and the funds will be managed on Colony and can be revoked by the DAO in a worst-case-scenario.\n\n**Vote**\n**Yes:** You support establishing the Product Workstream, appointing @CAO as interim workstream leader, and funding the workstream’s anticipated 2021 budget of $349,311. If this proposal passes, the equivalent amount of FOX will be transferred from the DAO’s treasury to the Product Workstream on Colony.\n\n**No:** You do not support establishing or funding the product workstream.",

What is it for?\n\nThe Engineering Workstream will be used for a couple purposes:\n\nFirst, fund the hiring of a set of full-time “core developers”. Initially, this will include a set of engineers that are currently full time ShapeShift employees. How many is yet to be determined.\n\nThis Core Developer will have the following priorities:\n\n- Maintaining and running of ShapeShift production systems, both legacy and newly built systems. This will include a 24x7 on-call rotation.\n- Fix high impact bugs\n- Assist community developers on-boarding onto the application stack, conduct community developer PR reviews, and assist community developers with design decisions as needed\n- Make production-running legacy code bases either open source or deprecated\n- New feature work\n- Any other work that is deemed necessary or beneficial to the product suite and DAO, as determined by the workstream\n\nNote that priorities may change, but the intent is to coordinate resources for maximum impact on DAO productivity.\n\nSecond, funds approved for bounty work may be delegated to this workstream. This will support the coordination of multiple potential dev efforts.\n\nHow exactly is this different than the other categories we already have?\n\nThere are no other workstreams being considered to hire full time engineers and coordinate the overall development effort.\n\nWhat is the mission of this workstream? \nTo support a thriving open source development community and a decentralized infrastructure delivery effort. We are building a quality software product that delights and empowers our users and gives them sovereign protection of their crypto. We do this with decentralized back-end services and a web and mobile front-end.\n\nWhat are the goals of this workstream?\n\n- Products working as designed, and available for use\n- Thriving open source community\n- New features added regularly (through both core dev efforts and community dev efforts)\n- Products developed to support use of tools for other workstreams to effectively accomplish their goals\n- Engineers should have fun\n- The priority / balance between each of these goals will change over time and as circumstances require\n\nWhat metrics can this workstream’s success be measured against?\n\n- Uptime. I am not sure what a realistic SLA target is for an actively-deving open source repository.\n- % of time core team spends developing in open source repos vs developing in closed source repos\n- count of bug tickets created, count of bug tickets resolved\n- Community developer commits\n- Discord community developer chat activity\n\nWhat should topics in this category generally contain?\n\n- Engineering Best Practices\n- Software and Infrastructure Architecture\n- Open Source Discussions\n\nDo we need this category? Can we merge with another category, or subcategory?\n\nI don’t see a way around having this category.\n\nDependencies on other Workstreams\n\n- Engineering workstream would be more successful with a workstream that was available to conduct manual regression testing until test coverage supplants it. It is expected that the legacy codebase will always need manual regression testing.\n- Engineering workstream would need detailed product specifications to determine scope of work and to build new features / make changes.\n- Engineering workstream would benefit from a workstream that handled customer issued / relations and answered customer questions, and brought in engineers as needed\n\nWill your workstream hold recurring meetings?\n\nWorkstream will hold recurring meetings. Twice a month public demos will be held. Eventually weekly workstream kickoff meetings will he held on Mondays. It is expected that subgroups in the workstream may have their own recurring meetings as well. And bounty projects may have their own recurring meetings.\n\nTerm for Workstream Leader\nA yes vote on this proposal assigns Josh Forman as the workstream leader until Feb 28, 2022.\n\nVoting For this Proposal:\nCreates the Engineering Workstream as defined here and assigns Josh Forman as the workstream leader until Feb 28, 2022.\n\nVoting Against this Proposal:\nCauses no action to occur.",

Our intent is that this repo will be under active development from both centralized foxes and DAO community developers. We are targeting to make this repo open source in the next few weeks.

The workstream leader will work with centralized ShapeShift engineers to determine the specific bounties.\n\nMotivation\n\nWe (centralized ShapeShift engineers) believe this would be a great way to get open source community involvement as early as possible. This is important to keep excitement around the project and build momentum. It is also a great way to get needed functionality added as quickly as possible.\n\nSpecification\n\nPassing this proposal would trigger 200K FOX to be sent to the Engineering workstream. The workstream leader will have the authority to spend 100K on bounties to community devs. The workstream leader is being entrusted to the following:\n\n- Work with centralized engineering to determine what functionality in the repo is appropriate for community dev work.\n- Determine how much FOX should be allocated to each bounty\n- Post bounties in a public forum. The DAO Discord could work. As could posting on gitcoin.\n- Track progress of bounty projects. Ensure devs who picked up the work have access to centralized dev foxes so they have the support they need to get the job done.\n- Evaluate completeness of work when person/team reports it is complete.\n- Pay out bounties\n\nThe workstream leader will be accountable to the community for success of this proposal. They will supply a report every two weeks to the community showing status of each bounty project. The report will include for each bounty project:\n\n- Bounty Name\n- Bounty Summary\n- Person or Group working bounty\n- Amount of bounty attached\n- Status of work\n\nIt is acceptable that current centralized foxes pick up bounty work, but they must do the bounty work after their salary-job hours.\n\nBenefits\n\n- Gets community dev involvement at the earliest possible opportunity\n- Huge learning from experimenting with our bounty process.\n- Features and functionality supplied to users of our products sooner.\n\nDrawbacks\n\n- Management overhead of the bounty program\n\nVote\n\nVote For:\nA vote for this proposal would immediately send 200K FOX to the engineering workstream. These funds would be used at the discretion of the engineering workstream leader to divvy out to bounty projects at their discretion. They are expected to work with the centralized engineering team in doing so.\n\nVote Against:\nA vote against this proposal would cause no action to be taken.\n",

      "content": "Initiative to begin the development of a comprehensive and streamlined repository of guides, visual media, documents, articles, blogs, and anything in between that one could find helpful in getting to know about ShapeShift, its services, the DAO, the FOX token, and the various ways to participate in the governance or DeFi aspect of FOX.\n\nThese crucial documents will then be translated on a rolling-basis to various languages of particular interest, staying true to our ethos of decentralization while increasing interest and demand for the FOX token.\n\nThis proposal was taken into heavy consideration for weeks and improvised several times. The initial polling showed [considerable support for the original proposal.](https://ethix.kr/assets/poll1.png) \n\n## Abstract\n\nShapeShift is an organization with a colorful history, highly respected leaders in the blockchain industry, and various top-of-the-line product/service offerings. As the company transitions into a fully decentralized organization, it is up to us, the community, to remain organized and efficient.\n\nInformation, the preservation of information, and the systematic process of sharing information has been the glue of human civilization and is arguably one of the most important functions in any organization, whether it be a for-profit corporation or a team of lawyers working on a case. \n\nShapeShift at the moment does not have an adequate information management system that is suitable for a DAO. **Information is fragmented throughout a chaotic mix of channels:** main website, Boardroom and Discourse, YouTube/Vimeo, docs and FAQs for each services, and a Zendesk. Each serve their own purpose in their respective areas, but this fragmentation of data leads to inconsistencies, confusion, errors, and in severe cases, security threats.\n\n**More Reading:**\n\n- [How It Benefits the DAO](https://forum.shapeshift.com/t/workstream-proposal-internationalization-laying-the-groundwork-for-the-global-push-of-fox/355/32#how-it-benefits-the-dao-3) 🤜🤛\n- [How It Benefits the FOX Tokenomics](https://forum.shapeshift.com/t/workstream-proposal-internationalization-laying-the-groundwork-for-the-global-push-of-fox/355/32#how-it-benefits-the-dao-3) 📡\n- [How It Benefits Future Workstreams and Projects](https://bootstraps.xyz/proposaluno/2.png) 🔍\n- [Benefits of a UIA for Enterprises](https://www.cio.com/article/2416284/five-advantages-of-unified-information-access--uia-.html) 💵\n\n---\n\n## Motivation\n\nI do not see a reason to delay the translation of documents for key languages where FOX would most benefit. To continue to ignore the international community would be ignorance on our part, and would not be in line with our ethos and core beliefs of true decentralization. \n\n> Information is power only if you can take action with it. Then, and only then, does it represent knowledge and, consequently, power. **- Daniel Burrus**\n\nTo add on to Burrus' quote, today's technology allows us to use information in efficient, smart, and seemingly magical ways that was never thought possible. It is a well-studied fact that good information management systems benefit enterprises tremendously. This workstream's attempt to collect and store all ethical and legal data pertaining to the DAO may also prove to be a great case study for future companies to study, as a company of this size and revenue deciding to decentralize all operations is a first. \n\n> ShapeShift ... demonstrated how an *old business* could operate in a *brand new way* because of the properties of cryptocurrencies. **Erik Voorhees, September 2015**\n\nAnd while ShapeShift is once again on a mission to prove this statement for a second time, it does not mean that the basic principles of business management should be thrown out the window. In fact, as a DAO it should be taken even more seriously as “decentralized” is likely to increase “unorganized” practices.\n\n---\n\n## Specification\n\n### Content Building, Globalization, and Raising International Leaders\n\nThe goal is to carefully vet and select qualified community members or anyone seeking to participate in our DAO as a contributing member that are qualified to speak, translate, and answer questions in key languages. The languages of particular interest are: Russian, Chinese, German, Korean, Japanese, and Spanish. These six languages were selected by a quick analysis of purchasing power, crypto adoption per capita, and innovation index in blockchain development outside of English speaking countries. \n\nThe languages are not fixed, rather fluid and will likely be filled in at different times depending on availability and demand. As new international members are added, new languages sections should be created in Discord and Discourse, which  will become the responsibility of the language leader to stay engaged in.\n\n[🔗 Read more on the new flexible timeline, responsibilities, and proposed process of onboarding new international team members.](https://www.notion.so/Globalization-Team-Members-efe9d21dcedb44fe957175516eb63d7c)\n\n---\n\n### FoxDoc Repo: Unified, Consistent, Pluggable and Usable Information On Demand for all Workstreams  📊 📚 📅\n\n![Frontend Dashboard](https://ethix.kr/assets/d1.png)\n\n- The FoxDoc Repo will allow community members to contribute to documents, guides, and miscellaneous information that is deemed needed by other workstream leaders as well as the ShapeShift Foundation.\n- The platform will keep track of contributors, the weight and quality of their contributions (weight calculated algorithmically, quality assigned by project leader), and will allow for the creation of more “mini-bounties” as we have seen growing lately in Discord.\n- This repo and the workstream will also be responsible for documenting and organizing information such as Weekly Governance Meeting Agendas and Their Summaries, Keeping Up-to-Date Information on Upcoming Events and Proposals, and will coordinate with the Community Mods to either assist or take charge of recording meetings.\n- The FoxDoc Repo will eventually be handed off to the ShapeShift Foundation and/or the Marketing & Growth workstream, whichever is deemed more appropriate. This is to protect the longevity and integrity of the repository regardless of the future workstream leader(s).\n\n**Preliminary specs, development goals, and vision for the [FoxDoc Repo can be read in depth here (will be constantly updated).](https://www.notion.so/FoxDoc-Repo-In-Depth-WIP-0e0785e5dd1e455c86dddd5fe2202fa2)**\n\n---\n## The following sections were cut out due to character limit issues on Snapshot.

      "title": "Osmosis Integration on ShapeShift",
      "content": "[Proposal] Osmosis Integration on ShapeShift Mobile and Web for ShapeShift Native Wallet and KeepKey\n\nSummary - This proposal would accomplish the following: 1. Add support for OSMO chain/asset on ShapeShift native wallet and KeepKey. 2. Add support for OSMO staking and reward claiming. 3. Add support for swapping OSMO/ATOM. 4. Add support for LPing for OSMO/ATOM pool. This integration would be on both mobile and web.\n\nAbstract - As a ShapeShift user, I want to be able to use the Osmosis DEX so that I can trade assets between blockchains. Users would get more functionality, and access to an additional chain and protocol while using the ShapeShift interfaces. While on ShapeShift Web and Mobile users will be able to send, receive and see their balances for OSMO. They will be able to trade the ATOM/OSMO pair. They will be able to stake OSMO and claim their rewards. They will be able to provide liquidity for the OSMO/ATOM pool. There would need to be a project team formed of a 1 project manager (myself, Danielle), 1-2 UI/UX designers, 3-5 engineers to begin to achieve this goal. After the project spec document is complete we can reassess the resource requirements.\n\nSpecification - To achieve this proposal we will have three milestones to meet: A. delivery of UI/UX designs to the community for review/feedback/approval for Osmosis integration into ShapeShift Mobile and Web. This should include functionality and UX for OSMO chain and asset support OSMO staking/reward claiming Swapping on the OSMO/ATOM pair at minimum (additional pairs would be a bonus for the UX but would require additional asset support) LPing for OSMO/ATOM pool (additional pairs would be a bonus for the UX but would require additional asset support)\n\nB. Engineering delivery of (1) and (2) from above in production and tested by Project Manager\n\nC: Engineering delivery of (3) and (4) from above in production and tested by Project Manager\n\nEach of these 3 milestones once accomplished would get 1/3 of the bounty, $100,000 in FOX. The project manager will be allocated 10%, The UI/ UX allocated 20% and the engineering work allocated 70% of the bounty.\n\nWe believe that it is also important to include support on the web platform for our hardware wallet, KeepKey for an additional bounty of $30,000 in FOX\n\nD: KeepKey Support for 1-4 from above in production and tested by Project Manager\n\nThe project manager will be allocated 5%, The UI/ UX allocated 5% and the engineering work allocated 85% of the bounty of $30,000 in FOX.\n\nThe total bounty for completion of A-D is $130,000 in FOX, only to be paid out if the milestones are completed.\n\nMotivation/ Benefits - There are limited solutions for this on the market, providing an opportunity to grab a large user base / market share. We believe that ShapeShift users have a desire to trade IBC enabled tokens in a safe and decentralized way (the ShapeShift way) and if we build an integration with Osmosis they will trade resulting in further usage of decentralized tools via more accessible solutions. There has already been much excitement and support from the OSMO community on this idea, The OSMO community has offered to match our FOX bounty with OSMO (pending their own governance vote)\n\nDrawbacks - This would take time of current ShapeShift Foxes and would need to be in addition to the current work they have on their plates to open source the current codebases. I do believe with both the FOX bounty and the OSMO bounty we will be able to combat this with the right incentives.\n\nVote - If you vote “for” this proposal you are voting to fund $130,000 in FOX that will be distributed if the milestones laid out above are achieved.\n\nIf you vote “against” you are saying you do not believe this integration with Osmosis and OSMO should move forward. Or maybe just not in this way.\n\nSpecial thanks to JonisJon, Expertbandit, and others that helped form these ideas.",

      "title": "Establishing Community Support/Structure",
      "content": "Summary: This proposal assigns two ‘Head Moderators’ to the position of community support/moderator. The positions are paid. Cmods (community moderators) are tasked with providing community support, organizational improvements, and expansion efforts, among other community focused activities. This team of moderators has been suggested and chosen in forum discussions during the drafting phase of proposal, found here: https://forum.shapeshift.com/t/community-support-establishing-structure-growth-capacity/158 (suggested moderators are huntthewick and giantkin).\n\nAbstract: Central purpose in assigning community mods/organizers is to provide community support. Further, these ‘Cmods’ engage in expansion/outreach/onboarding efforts to ensure healthy community dynamics. This team of community ‘Cmods’ are tasked with ensuring community experience does not degrade as the Fox den becomes more populated and expansive in years to come.\n\nMotivation: Community support/moderators do not just prevent excessive ‘noise’ in the community caused by trolls, bad-actors, and confused individuals who may spam the discord without becoming familiar with the community in which they’re attempting participation. As our Fox community expands problems have, and will continue to arise. The task of structuring and furthermore, expanding the community in order to promote a healthy DAO is an important one. Enabling a productive and healthy community environment is critical in members interacting in an efficient manner.\n\nSpecification: Community moderators support and enable healthy community growth. These individuals are responsible for tasks associated with supporting, informing, and protecting the FOX community from bad actors (including but not limited to scammers and malicious users). Two ‘Cmods’ are identified as being immediately needed by the community according to tasks and work necessary within a number of ‘Fox Dens’ (the communities that we inhabit such as discord, telegram, forum, boardroom, reddit). \n\n‘Cmods’ are needed to address the lacking community support structure within the discord, telegram, forum, and boardroom. While further coverage must necessarily occur across other community engagement venues (reddit, and the like). Community projects, activities, and other engagement-points will be focused on by the ‘Cmod’ team alongside marketing & growth workstream contributors. Beyond that, a support system will be established for discord in order to address relevant community problems/concerns. Therefore, after discussion within forum phases of this proposal’s development, huntthewick and giantkin are being nominated to accept the task of community support/moderation. The logic behind having two ‘Head Moderators’ is that community moderation tasks/project workload may be overwhelming. Continuous availability of a ‘Head Moderator’ would be optimal for any given situation that may arise.\n\nActivation of the aforementioned ‘Cmod’ team will occur immediately upon completion of successful vote. Compensation allocation for Initial community growth/moderation team: 9000 USD/thirty days (allocated in fox token) according to market price at the date/time of disbursement. This compensation will be split evenly between the two individuals suggested during the community forum proposal drafting and community discussion phases (huntthewick and giantkin). This term will end in four months.\n\nDisadvantages: Could not determine disadvantage.\n\nBenefits: This proposal is community inspired and is intended to enable a community environment that promotes the values that we as Fox find to be of importance. This ensures that not only will we early Fox enjoy the community; those who join in the future too will have an experience that is everything a new Fox could hope for.",

      "title": "Adding FOX to Tip.cc",
      "content": "Summary: I have started the process of adding FOX to Tip.cc due to the beneficial nature of having features such as those provided by Tip.cc (telegram and discord cryptocurrency tipping any of the 228+ cryptocurrencies supported by tip.cc). The purpose of this proposal is to allocate funding (1000usd) in order to move forward with the process of adding FOX to Tip.cc.\n\nAbstract: In adding FOX to Tip.cc, not only will our community be enabled to utilize a tipping function within the community platform. In adding this feature for the FOX community, FOX will benefit from direct use of the bot—as other communities interested in tipping one another with FOX via Tip.cc can too. By providing other communities with an ability to tip one another with FOX via Tip.cc, the FOX community is extending customer reach to those who may have never heard of FOX.\n\nMotivation: Tipping FOX token within our discord and telegram communities (A telegram community will be developed and moderated as the DAO prescribes) is an incentivization mechanism that promotes engagement and growth.\n\nSpecification: I have already contacted Tip.cc and am awaiting response from the support team in order to add FOX to the list of cryptocurrencies that Tip.cc supports. This will cost 1000usd, and will be funded by the DAO upon successful ‘Yes’ vote. There is a commission for referring shapeshift to Tip.cc of 10% (100usd), however I will use any compensation from Tip.cc to tip users within the community.\n\nBenefits: Community engagement will be promoted through the feature of tipping one another within the FOX discord and telegram communities. Further, external communities will be able to enjoy the use of FOX when tipping in said communities.\n\nDisadvantages: I do not see any disadvantage to this proposal if it were to pass.",

      "title": "Potential Commission for Custom NFTs for First 10 Accepted Proposals",
      "content": "Summary - My proposal is to create 10 fox themed custom NFTs (integrating the evolution of the FOX logo over the years) and award them to the creators of the first 10 accepted proposals on the DAO.\n\nAbstract - This proposal will include 10 custom digital art pieces, each individually minted and sent to the VERY FIRST 10 creators of accepted proposals on the Shapeshift DAO (not including myself). Each piece will be uniquely its own and the vision is to share the story of Shapeshift over the past 7+ years through these 10 pieces by incorporating the evolution of the Shapeshift FOX logo.\n\nMotivation - As someone who has been along for the entire ride of Shapeshift, with a unique perspective, not being an employee, it is my hope that these pieces will not only share a story of the history of Shapeshift but also commemorate this next chapter.\n\nThe hope is to add value to being the first contributors to the project, incentivizing involvement, creating excitement, and rewarding people with awesome NFTs. The NFTs also have the opportunity to be used as marketing materials to get people excited about the Shapeshift DAO.\n\nSpecification - I will create and mint 10 NFTs that will be awarded to the first 10 accepted proposals on the DAO (not including this one) that will be delivered at the rate of 2 pieces per week at the cost of 1200 FOX per piece totaling 12,000 FOX. I will be in charge of collecting the proper addresses for the delivery of the NFTs to the appropriate awardees. I will put a 10% commission on secondary sales into the NFT contracts and I will give ½ of the proceeds back to the DAO if and when it sells (if applicable).\n\nBenefits - Motivation for others to become involved in the early days of the Shapeshift DAO. Drum up excitement for this project while supporting the community through intuitive art. Capturing a moment in time, through a custom NFT, at the very beginning of this project. The possibility of further secondary sales, thus adding revenue back to the DAO.\n\nDrawbacks - I do not see any drawbacks to this proposal but am open to hearing feedback on what others may see that I do not.\n\nVote- A “for” vote would mean funding 12000 FOX in order to commission the creation and minting of 10 individual NFTS. Those NFTs would be given out to the first 10 creators of accepted proposals (myself not included) as well as the Shapeshift DAO gaining 5% of any future sales of these NFTs.\n\nAn “against” would mean that none of these pieces get created or distributed.\n\n",
