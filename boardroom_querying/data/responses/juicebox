      "title": "JBP-515: Juiceworks Chapter 2",
      "content": "## Synopsis\n\n*Juiceworks was successful in helping a number of projects get off the ground over the previous 4 months:*\n\n\\- Welshare Health has raised over 222 ETH https://juicebox\\.money/@welshare\n\\- Biohacker DAO has raised over 46 ETH https://juicebox\\.money/@biohackerdao\n\\- Gardens has raised over 12 ETH https://juicebox\\.money/v2/p/697\n\nWith Filip's recent departure from leading Juiceworks, I (Jango) have come in with the intent of building on the early success. We can't replace Filip, he's one of a kind and a big reason why Juiceworks has been working. We can however learn what tactics have been working and propose a re-staffed future that plays to the strengths of those of us carrying the project onward.\n\nI've pulled in Zeugh – JuiceboxDAO's original community manager, and 0xGogo – longtime Juicebox DAO community member who most notably pulled off the Noun Comics creation and marketing using a 175 ETH budget from NounsDAO. They will join Chromuh.eth and Palmer who have worked with Filip over the past 4 months.\n\nThe five of us will continue delivering Juiceworks as the organization that helps make Juicebox projects work. We will do so with a budget of $7,850 per ruleset, that will be accounted for as a $WORKS revnet as soon as V4 is deployed. We want JuiceboxDAO to benefit from the success of $WORKS, we're grateful for the operating capital it has provided thus far and might continue to provide.\n\n## Motivation\n\n**Juiceworks helps make Juicebox projects work. We do so by focusing on the following 6 pillars:**\n\n* **Lead generation:** Find and join emerging mission-oriented communities, understanding where they're coming from and what their needs are.\n    * **Lead:** Palmer\n    * **Subpillars:**\n        * **Outbound:** Directly get in touch with everyone working on an interesting crypto project.\n        * **Inbound:** Create well-placed posts online and at events that attract questions from project creators.\n* **Partnerships:** Connect with organizations whose work creates mutual positive feedback loops with our mission, creating inroads for more effective capital allocation and cross pollinated marketing.\n    * **Lead:** Chromuh\n    * **Subpillars:**\n        * **Deal Flow:** Find partners who want to use Juiceworks as a filter for great investible community-driven projects.\n        * **Discovery:** Find partner ecosystems that provide quality project leads that can be developed into the next big success. MoonDAO comes to mind as an example, likely other DeSci hubs.\n        * **Presence:** Be present in town halls and forums of other communities, fostering mutually-beneficial relationships that could become quality leads down the road.\n* **Marketing:** Position Juicebox V4 as the most secure and trusted tool to launch and grow Web3 projects, and Juiceworks as an approachable platform to get started.\n    * **Lead:** Gogo\n    * **Subpillars:**\n        * **Attract:** Attract new users by creating a sense of curiosity and credibility.\n            * **Founder-Led Code Walkthroughs:** Begin with video walkthroughs of the Juicebox V4 code by the founder. These will emphasize security and transparency and be chopped into short clips for social platforms.\n            * **Educational Content:** Posts about the importance of security in crowdfunding, leveraging the trust built by Juicebox. Focus on practical insights into creating a safe project, targeting Web3 creators who value a secure foundation.\n        * **Convert:** Convert interested audiences into users and investors by validating Juiceworks as an authentic and trusted platform.\n            * **Show Real People Behind the Brand:** Introduce Juiceworks as its own entity with real faces behind it, distinguishing it from the anonymity of JuiceboxDAO. Show that there is a team genuinely working on helping creators.\n            * **Partnerships with Web3 Influencers:** Collaborate with influencers who can showcase how Juicebox V4 simplifies the process of launching projects, especially focusing on security and ease of use. Their trust in the platform will transfer to their audience. Examples of influencers include people who have used Juicebox, created projects, or are planning on doing something cool with V4, but who also have influence in their respective ecosystem.\n        * **Retain:** Retain users and create loyalty by providing a high-quality experience and clear pathways for community involvement.\n            * **Interactive Q&A Sessions:** Use Banny to conduct Q&A sessions where creators can get personalized help, making it both informative and fun. These sessions should communicate security and clarity without overwhelming users with complexity.\n            * **Highlighting User Milestones:** Celebrate creator milestones within the community. Make sure they feel acknowledged and valued, which helps retain and build long-term loyalty.\n        * **Tone & Branding:** Authentic, Informative, and Personable: The tone is mostly serious, focused on security and clarity, but with moments of lightness to make the brand approachable. The branding will be distinct from Juicebox but will borrow certain visual elements for continuity.\n        * **First Steps:**\n            * Prepare founder-led code walkthrough videos.\n            * Design a visual content series emphasizing the core values of security, transparency, and clarity.\n            * Launch initial content on Instagram and other key platforms to attract and build trust, establishing Juiceworks as the go-to brand for secure and transparent project launches.\n* **Community & Education:** Welcome folks into Juiceworks and offer guidance to folks newer to web3 and/or fundraising, helping clarify and simplify each step.\n    * **Lead:** Zeugh\n    * **Subpillars**:\n        * Organized notes and documents.\n        * CRM for triaged project support so that we can provide more focused and streamlined attention when needed.\n        * In real life project support and community building.\n* **Finance:** Help communities, campaigns, and businesses attract capital using sustainable models that fit their needs.\n    * **Lead:** Jango\n    * **Subpillars:**\n        * **Investible:** Through their projects, people want to attract capital. Meanwhile, capital allocators want to attract great people that can operate toward visionary mission. Project finances should make it easier for money to find people.\n        * **Customization:** Each project brings its own dynamic to the table, its financial architecture should be designed to work in the context of its operations, while reusing as many familiar/simple patterns as possible.\n        * **Sustainability:** Work to achieve Juiceworks' own financial sustainability and growth so it can continue to help others succeed.\n\nPalmer and Chromuh will be available to meet directly with project creators to form fundraising strategies as needed.\n\nThe Juiceworks discord currently has 41 private channels with projects who are either in the process of planning their project or has already launched. I've met with a few reputable ones who are coming up on showtime, and have glanced over the threads of the others left behind by Filip. There's a ton of promise that I wasn't totally aware of prior to taking over as admin on Juiceworks, and I'm confident we can add to this by focusing more on marketing and in-real-life relationship building.\n\nWe will use juiceworks.eth – a multisig operated by the team – as a trusted project owner on behalf of organizations who prefer to hold off on operating on their own. This will give Juiceworks leverage over collecting tokens generated from paying protocol fees.\n\nOnce the $WORKS revnet is live, we will be advising projects launched through the Juiceworks ecosystem to route 5% of their inbound funds to $WORKS.\n\n## Specification\n\n*$7,850 to Juiceworks per cycle, to be spent as follows:*\n\n$1.5k to 0xGoGo.eth\n$1k to Zeugh.eth\n$1.5k to Chromuh.eth\n$1.5k to Palmer\n$1.5k to jango.eth\n$750 on ad spend by 0xGogo\n$100 on transaction operations on projects' behalf.\n\nA one time 2m $JBX allocation will be managed by 0xGogo.eth for marketing purposes.\nWe will also ask to be sent 5m $JBX each time a Juiceworks project reaches $100k in raised funds. Valid up to three projects, expires December 31, 2024. This will override the previous commitment from Juiceworks' previous proposal, from the time of this proposal's approval.\n\n## Rationale\n\n*As we are operating pre $WORKS revnet, we want to maintain a balance of paying folks in ETH for time, and rewarding incentives for successful outcomes.*\n\n## Risks\n\n*The biggest risk I'm currently managing is a personnel risk. A staff of 5 is a lot, I'm curious how folks will find and own their projects while working together to achieve our goals. I've told everyone I'm running this as a business that I intend to model as a revnet, and will adapt plans as needed to make sure we achieve our goals.*\n\nI am also cognizant of the fact that other JuiceboxDAO members will likely be helping with the Juiceworks mission by virtue of being helpful to Juicebox projects. Over time, I will continuously restructure Juiceworks' finances to support what's working and the people most crucial to the mission. The most important thing for me is to get the project profitable and self sustaining.\n\n## Timeline\n\n*Next cycle.*\n\n```nance-actions\n--- nance-actions\n- type: Payout\n  uuid: c3be1351ade54cfa87fd51c91c13f6c0\n  payload:\n    amount: \"7850\"\n    type: project\n    project: 687\n    address: \"0xAF28bcB48C40dBC86f52D459A6562F658fc94B1e\"\n  governanceCycles:\n    - 86\n    - 87\n    - 88\n    - 89\n    - 90\n    - 91\n    - 92\n    - 93\n  pollRequired: false\n- type: Transfer\n  uuid: 1a60bdbe450d43f48579aac76ac05a0c\n  payload:\n    chainId: 1\n    to: \"0xD1F6bE4e4cd3AeB48c8F7EA4a8922e5e48ce4D9D\"\n    amount: \"2000000\"\n    contract: \"0x4554CC10898f92D45378b98D6D6c2dD54c687Fb2\"\n    decimals: 18\n  governanceCycles:\n    - 86\n  pollRequired: false\n- type: Transfer\n  uuid: 00b7225951004c5a8d1",

This is an address tied to a [spritz.finance](https://www.spritz.finance) virtual debit card created by jigglyjams. This will be used to cover offchain expenses that are currently being funded by filipv and require reimbursement. The debit card number has been sent to filipv who controls the services, now we must fund it with USDC so we can start charging items to it. This amount should cover 4-5 months of offchain fees. Any remaining fees will remain on the debit card and be used for future months.\n\nIf the debit card through spritz is a success then we should propose another transfer in the future\\. If there are any issues we should reassess and find a new service\\. Another potential option is [raincards.xyz](https://www.raincards.xyz) which jigglyjams also recently signed up for\\.\n\n## Rationale\n\nThis is much less work than reimbursements. See spritz.finance fees [here](https://app.spritz.finance/fees).\n\n## Risks\n\nspritz.finance could prevent movement of funds\n\n* jigglyjams has been using it for Nance for 1 month and it is working very well\n\n## Timeline\n\nASAP\n\n```nance-actions\n--- nance-actions\n- type: Transfer\n  uuid: 5fe76e9ccbf6480b894ad63398baec48\n  payload:\n    chainId: 1\n    amount: \"450\"\n    to: \"0x341c46344f57a3bad101385e901ccf886af71153\"\n    contract: \"0xA0b86991c6218b36c1d19D4a2e9Eb0cE3606eB48\"\n  governanceCycles:\n    - 83\n  pollRequired: false\n\n```",

I also refit our existing integration tests while we made extensive changes to the protocol.

      "content": "## Synopsis\nThere were incorrect fees taken out of payouts to projects between starting from July 25, 2023. This proposal returns the incorrect fees to the projects.\n\n## Motivation\nOn July 29, 2024 Jigglyjams discovered that improper fees were being taken out of payments from the Juicebox treasury to other Juicebox projects ([Discord message](https://discord.com/channels/775859454780244028/915334655144787998/1267512080781676626)).\n\nWhen Juicebox DAO migrated to new `JBETHPaymentTerminal`'s the previous terminals were not see as feeless addresses. As a result all `distributePayoutsOf` from Juicebox to other projects NOT using the same terminal as Juicebox incurred an incorrect 2.5% protocol fee\n\nIn order to prevent this from happening in the future, [JBP-506](https://nance.app/s/juicebox/506) specifies the setting of all `JBETHPaymentTerminal`'s to feeless.\n\n## Specification\nSee https://github.com/jigglyjams/juicebox-fee-discrepancy for fee calculations and extended research\n\nThe following `pay` transactions shall be executed to resolve the improper fees. For the work done, jigglyjams is requesting a 15% finders fee which shall be sent to [@jigglyjams](https://juicebox.money/@jigglyjams).\n\n| ProjectId |                     Project Name & Link                       | Excess Fees Charged (ETH) | Finders fee (ETH)    |   After fee (ETH)     |\n| :-------: | :----------------------------------------------------------:  | :-----------------------: | :---------------:    | :-----------------:   |\n|       387 | [@wagmi-studios](https://juicebox.money/@wagmi-studios)       |    *1.055030557777181604* |     N/A fees owed    |       N/A fees owed   |\n|       397 | [@peel](https://juicebox.money/@peel)                         |      8.892181052298771322 | 1.333827157844815698 | 7.558353894453955624  |\n|       421 | [@exhausted-pigeon](https://juicebox.money/@exhausted-pigeon) |      2.059416717385266471 | 0.30891250760778997  | 1.750504209777476501  |\n|       470 | [@breadfruit](https://juicebox.money/@breadfruit)             |      1.605713071553927699 | 0.240856960733089154 | 1.364856110820838545  |\n|       477 | [@nance-app](https://juicebox.money/@nance-app)               |      1.970929431515883919 | 0.295639414727382587 | 1.675290016788501332  |\n|       488 | [Bananapus](https://juicebox.money/v2/p/488)                  |      1.761242616497408637 | 0.264186392474611295 | 1.497056224022797342  |\n|       549 | [Sablier V2 Interop Dev](https://juicebox.money/v2/p/549)     |      0.059078174758318802 | 0.00886172621374782  | 0.050216448544570982  |\n|       552 | [@juicecast](https://juicebox.money/@juicecast)               |      1.306116252162166165 | 0.195917437824324924 | 1.110198814337841241  |\n|           |                               **TOTAL**                       |     17.654677316171743015 | 2.648201597425761448 | 15.006475718745981567 |\n\n**NOTE:**\n@wagmi-studios still owes @juicebox ~1.09 ETH due to a [previous error in bookkeeping](https://docs.juicebox.money/dev/resources/post-mortem/2023-02-22/#wagmi) from February 22, 2023 thus these fees were not taken into account\n\n## Rationale\nThis seems like the proper thing to do\n\n## Risks\nThere is a risk that incorrect values were calculated.

      "title": "JBP-505: Nance Grant for Better Multisig Queuing ",
      "content": "## Synopsis\n\nUpdate Nance interface and API to relieve burden of multisig ops queuing from filipv.\n\n## Motivation\n\nNo one should be doing this burdensome administrative work. Its time consuming and not fun.\n\nPayment will be use to support development time from @nance-app.\n\n## Specification\n\nNance features needed to alleviate multisig ops:\n\n1. **Milestone based actions**\n    * update frontend actions to allow for a checkbox to mark a proposal as milestone based\n    * update frontend to allow for any DAO member to click a button that will trigger a Discord poll asking the DAO if the milestone has been met\n    * update backend to support the status of actions that have been approved (most likely a new table)\n    * update backend to check for milestone based polls and tally the results\n    * update backend to move status of action upon completion of poll\n    * update backend to add timeout for triggering of poll so a DAO member can only trigger a poll once per cycle\n2. **Action to occur at future governance cycle**\n    * update frontend actions to allow for proposer to add a specific governance cycle number on when the action should occur\n    * update backend to accept an action with a governance cycle start that is different than current governance cycle\n3. **Multi governance cycle transfer action**\n    * *required for https://nance.app/s/juicebox/488 support*\n    * update frontend to include a governance cycle start and count for `Transfer` actions\n4. **Send transaction thread describing relevant proposals**\n    * update backend to compile current governance cycle transactions (currently in a script state, needs to be functionized)\n    * update backend to send reconfiguration to Tenderly for simulation (currently in broken state)\n    * write backend tests for Tenderly transaction sending\n    * update backend transaction message to show all relevant proposals\n    * update backend transaction message to show the difference in funding distribution limit\n5. **Queue transactions from nance.app with gas reimbursement enabled**\n    * *to eliminate subsequent reimbursement transactions, this is a never ending cycle unless we reimburse gas from safe*\n    * add gas amount parameter to safe transaction when queuing from nance.app (see https://docs.onchainden.com/pay-gas-from-safe/overview)\n    * write backend test for proper accumulation of distribution limit and payouts\n    * write shared function to calculate distribution limit and payout allocations\n6. **Decide upon reimbursement plan for off-chain subscriptions (Notion, Gmail, Figma)**\n    * explore options on how to implement the lowest administrative methods of reimbursements of offchain expenditures\n    * define a plan on how to implement above decision\n    * create `Reimbursement` action\n    * update frontend to support `Reimbursement` action\n    * define reimbursement process so all DAO members know how to act upon a reimbursement\n7. Action to cancel a previous proposal\n    * Create a new table that tracks active actions\n    * Create active action API endpoint\n    * Search active actions on frontend and allow for a user to select an action they want to cancel\n    * On passing, remove the selected action from the active actions table\n\n## Timeline\n\nPay initial deposit of $5,000 to @nance project to secure developer time. Pay subsequent $500/cycle to @nance upon completion of above (ONLY IF WE COMPLETE ONE BUTTON QUEUING #DOGFOODING).\n\n```nance-actions\n--- nance-actions\n- type: Payout\n  uuid: a084d6c0049441cd9ff4e731bb56a6fd\n  payload:\n    type: project\n    count: \"1\"\n    amountUSD: \"5000\"\n    project: 477\n    address: \"0xAF28bcB48C40dBC86f52D459A6562F658fc94B1e\"\n\n```",

Town hall recordings total ~8 GB of data right now, so 20 GB should cover a few years of meetings.\n\n```nance-actions\n--- nance-actions\n- type: Transfer\n  uuid: 561995340381445cb791be846f7799ed\n  payload:\n    chainId: 1\n    to: \"0x30670D81E487c80b9EDc54370e6EaF943B6EAB39\"\n    amount: \"0.05\"\n    contract: ETH\n- type: Transfer\n  uuid: f4b02e190ebe4a52a9ec4f93f3b9ab6a\n  payload:\n    chainId: 1\n    to: \"0x823b92d6a4b2AED4b15675c7917c9f922ea8ADAD\"\n    amount: \"0.05\"\n    contract: ETH\n- type: Custom Transaction\n  uuid: 454cdde5f99247e2a9e88d5130aa0708\n  payload:\n    contract: \"0xfa391de95fcbcd3157268b91d8c7af083e607a5c\"\n    value: \"100000000000000000\"\n    tenderlyStatus: \"false\"\n    args:\n      - value:\n          type: BigNumber\n          hex: \"0x01d7\"\n        type: uint256\n        name: _projectId\n      - value:\n          type: BigNumber\n          hex: \"0x016345785d8a0000\"\n        type: uint256\n        name: _amount\n      - value: \"0x000000000000000000000000000000000000EEEe\"\n        type: address\n        name: _token\n      - value: \"0x30670D81E487c80b9EDc54370e6EaF943B6EAB39\"\n        type: address\n        name: _beneficiary\n      - value:\n          type: BigNumber\n          hex: \"0x00\"\n        type: uint256\n        name: _minReturnedTokens\n      - value: true\n        type: bool\n        name: _preferClaimedTokens\n      - value: >-\n          \n          https://jbm.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmTPQXW4E6Hy2adEbpNGQ93dwaVL6wZBUEG1ZcQuB4QT5X\n        type: string\n        name: _memo\n      - value: \"0x000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000\\\n          00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000b3bcbb7900\\\n          000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000\\\n          000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000100000000000000000000\\\n          000000000000000000000000000000000000000000a00000000000000000000000000\\\n          000000000000000000000000000000000000001000000000000000000000000000000\\\n          0000000000000000000000000000000002\"\n        type: bytes\n        name: _metadata\n    functionName: function pay(uint256 _projectId, uint256 _amount, address _token,\n      address _beneficiary, uint256 _minReturnedTokens, bool\n      _preferClaimedTokens, string _memo, bytes _metadata) payable returns\n      (uint256)\n\n```",

      "content": "## Proposal\n\n1. Pay [Juiceworks](https://juicebox.money/v2/p/687) $6,410 per cycle for 7 cycles to help Juicebox project creators and expand Juicebox outreach.\n2. Up to three times within the first year after this proposal's approval, each time a Juiceworks-supported project raises more than 50 ETH, send Juiceworks 5m JBX.\n\n## The Goal\n\nIncrease the number of Juicebox projects launched each month as much as we can, with a focus on projects with large fundraising goals (over 100 ETH). For more, see [our website](https://juiceworks.xyz/).\n\n## The Plan\n\nI've recruited two people to help me with Juiceworks:\n\n* [Chromuh](https://x.com/0xchromuh) is a creative technologist, artist, and designer. He's studying communication design.\n* Palmer has a background in sales, finance, and social media marketing.\n\nOn Monday, July 1st, we'll begin a week of training. I'll walk them through everything they need to know to help Juicebox projects in daily 2-hour meetings. Juiceworks members will also take on 2-3 hours of daily independent study. During this week, Juiceworks members will join my meetings with project creators. Right now I'm working with 5 prospective Juicebox projects – this will give them an opportunity to understand what real projects need help with.\n\nFrom then on out, we'll be:\n\n1. Responding to inbound requests and messages in the Juicebox Discord server – both contact requests from juicebox.money and Discord messages.\n2. Putting together a CRM to organize and bring more transparency to this process.\n3. Scaling up online outreach. We'll either continue running existing accounts or make new accounts on X and Farcaster. We'll regularly post educational materials and reach out to prospective project creators.\n4. Following the creation of new Juicebox projects and reaching out to their creators (if we can find them) if we aren't already in contact with them.\n5. Upgrading materials on the [User Docs](https://docs.juicebox.money/user/) and [JuiceboxDAO YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/juiceboxdao).\n6. Working with Rene and Artizen projects to make the [Artizen + Juicebox Match Fund](https://nance.app/s/juicebox/494) a success.\n\nWe're open to other suggestions.\n\n```nance-actions\n--- nance-actions\n- type: Payout\n  uuid: 437f857e75474f80a00d833182608d54\n  payload:\n    type: project\n    count: \"7\"\n    amountUSD: \"6410\"\n    project: 687\n    address: \"0xAF28bcB48C40dBC86f52D459A6562F658fc94B1e\"\n\n```",

      "title": "JBP-503: $15,000 for CCIP Sucker development",
      "content": "## Synopsis\n\n*Wrapping up the deployment of the V4 protocol has been more demanding than first imagined and funded in [JBP 487](https://nance.app/s/juicebox/487) due to the more-recent inclusion of a CCIP Sucker contract that will allow us to use Chainlink's infrastructure to connect Juicebox treasuries across any chain, not just the ones we build specific native support for. This work has been largely built and tested by Nowonder and 0xBa5ed, with Jango carrying project management along.*\n\n## Motivation\n\n*We previously had built Sucker contracts that connected Optimism to Mainnet, Base to Mainnet, and Arbitrum to Mainnet. These all used the native bridges of the respective ecosystems, which allows for certain \"bare metal\" efficiencies.*\n\nRecently, after Chainlink's CCIP infrastructure came out of beta, we hypothesized using it to solve for arbitrary subsequent suckers connecting any number of other EVMs so we wouldn't have to go through them one-by-one post-deploy. After some quick prototyping, we deemed this a viable option, and are now approaching a tested production candidate.\n\nThis has been delicate work that still requires attention to arrive at a definitive end. JuiceboxDAO should recognize the value in this specific work, acknowledging that it does not add risk of instigating a forever series of expenses on top of JBP 487. \n\nThe production work can be seen here: https://github.com/Bananapus/nana-suckers/pull/40\n\n## Specification\n\n*One time payouts of $6,600 worth of ETH to nowonder and 0xBas5ed. $1800 payout to jango through Breadfruit.*\n\n## Rationale\n\n*We're at the finish line, we don't need ongoing funds. I just want to make sure we recognize the work and strategy.*\n\n## Risks\n\n*New infrastructure always has unknowns. We are doing what we can to communicate and scope these risks as we go along to not create a forever expense.*\n\n## Timeline\n\n*Next cycle.*\n\n```nance-actions\n--- nance-actions\n- type: Payout\n  uuid: 6330c8c1916b4d558ab20923d7462adb\n  payload:\n    type: address\n    count: \"1\"\n    amountUSD: \"6600\"\n    address: \"0x73ACD3C8e41524fF083a03067a765030E5385bAd\"\n- type: Payout\n  uuid: fabde367d14841e7b9ac90a3a5d732e0\n  payload:\n    type: address\n    count: \"1\"\n    amountUSD: \"6600\"\n    address: \"0xb045708e396E20071324C1aed2E4CFB90A0764FE\"\n- type: Payout\n  uuid: 31129cb146364611b65e5bb1211e6453\n  payload:\n    type: project\n    count: \"1\"\n    amountUSD: \"1800\"\n    project: 470\n    address: \"0xAF28bcB48C40dBC86f52D459A6562F658fc94B1e\"\n\n```",

      "content": "## Synopsis\n\nThis governance proposal outlines funding the integration of the V4 Juicebox (omnichain) contracts on juicebox.money (JBM).\n\n## Motivation\n\n> For an overview of the project plan and technical details, see Rationale section.\n\nSince being funded in Oct 2023, the #protocol team has been hard at work on Bananapus, a.k.a \"The Juicebox V4 Contracts\".\n\nThere are currently two web applications being built on the new contracts: [Bannyverse](https://mint.banny.eth.sucks/) and [Revnet](https://revnet.app).\nBut JBM remains the primary gateway into Juicebox, and thanks to Strath and Wraeth’s recent work, the UX continues to improve.\n\nBut sooner or later, JBM will need to migrate to V4. We propose that the time is now.\n\nV4 contracts will be a huge win for juicebox.money. It will eventually allow projects to be launched and operated across multiple chains, allowing users to pay projects on gas-efficient chains and use the tokens they gain across all other chains the project is launched on. [See more](https://snapshot.org/#/jbdao.eth/proposal/0x7577b6e8c53ccd3d26b484adac66195cc5486a3a3c5f8c8d4520c277b9c0a9d3). L2/Multichain Juicebox has been a (if not, the most) heavily requested feature by the Juicebox community (see **Appendix** section at the end of this document).\n\nAeolian and Johnny D, as the developers behind the V2/V3 Juicebox contracts integration on juicebox.money, understand the depth of the task.\n\n## Specification\n\nUS$12k per cycle for 7 cycles to @v4-frontend-developers Juicebox project.\n\n## Rationale\n\nIntegrating V4 into JBM is no small feat. We propose a 3-phase implementation plan.\n\nThis proposal doesn't make guarantees about timelines or completion of specific milestones. We'll endeavor to complete work as quickly and effectively as possible, but the complexity and uncertainty inherent in this implementation means that milestones are hard to define and timelines are inaccurate. We commit to providing weekly status updates in Discord. If JBDAO is unhappy with the progress, anyone is free to submit a cancellation to this proposal.\n\n**Phase 1: V4 mainnet support**\nGoal: get V4 working on JBM, on mainnet. The initial phase aims to support V4 projects launched on mainnet, close-to feature parity with the existing JBM. This allows us to set a technical foundation for Phase 2, and usher incoming JB projects to V4 as soon as possible.\n\nJBM V4 mainnet projects will be indicated as \"beta\".\n\n**Phase 2: L2**\nGoal: allow projects to launch on L2, and have an L2 project page.\nThis phase brings JBM into the world of L2s. Projects will be able to launch on a single L2, and collect payments and manage their treasuries on a single L2.\n\nThis is possible on Revnet.app today, built by Aeolian. See these links for an example: https://revnet.app/sepolia/net/2, https://revnet.app/opsepolia/net/2).\n\nIt does not enable full cross-chain/omnichain functionality; we'll support projects with a single treasury on a single chain, not projects with multiple treasuries across multiple chains. This will come in Phase 3.\n\n**Phase 3: Omnichain**\nGoal: expose the full power of V4, with omnichain support. \nWhile we’ve teased out some of the technical details and UX with the Revnet project, there’s still much to investigate and solidify. If we make it to this phase, we're committed to working with UX specialists alongside #protocol team to find the best path forward.\n\nGiven the complexities and unknowns at hand, it’s difficult to commit to accurate timelines. This proposal commits to fulfilling Phase 1, and spending any remaining time on Phase 2.\n\n##### **Phase 1 technical implementation plan**\n\nIn recent weeks, we have devised a plan to deliver Phase 1, outlined as follows:\n\n1. Remove underused/legacy features from JBM ([Done](https://github.com/jbx-protocol/juice-interface/pull/4354))\n2. Reduce reliance on database in favor of subgraph ([Done](https://github.com/jbx-protocol/juice-interface/pull/4366))\n3. Complete Ethers V5 -> V6 upgrade ([In review](https://github.com/jbx-protocol/juice-interface/pull/4305), credits Wraeth)\n4. Reorganise codebase to be version-first ([in progress](https://github.com/jbx-protocol/juice-interface/pull/4367))\n5. Prepare codebase for wagmi and V4\n    1. Scope all existing React providers to existing pages\n    2. Remove providers from global scope (e.g. Supabase)\n    3. Remove all uses of the database, besides Project Search. Then purge unused data.\n6. Create proof-of-concept V4 project page, at juicebox.money/v4/mainnet/:projectId\n    1. Using [wagmi](https://wagmi.sh/) library, [juice-sdk-v4](https://github.com/Bananapus/juice-sdk-v4), making any upgrades to juice-sdk-v4 as necessary.\n7. Flesh out core V4 project page features\n    1. Rewrite all v2v3 components to be v4-compatible\n8. Implement V4 project settings\n9. Implement project creation in V4\n\nNote that the UI will remain roughly the same as v2/v3, with accommodations made for V4 as necessary.\n\n##### **Phase 2 technical implementation plan**\n\n1. Upgrade Juice SDK to use latest wagmi/viem (Done)\n2. Support L2 in Juice SDK (Done)\n3. Subgraph deployments to all supported chains (outside this proposal's scope)\n4. Create 'aggregator' API endpoints to aggregate subgraph queries across chains (e.g. build one endpoint to get all JB projects across chains)\n5. Add ability to 'hotswap' subgraph URLs based on the given chain\n6. Add support to L2 routing (/base/p/2, /arbitrum/p/69)\n7. Add \"switch network\" to all transaction buttons\n8. Add UI to indicate a project's chain.\n\n## Risks\n\n\\- We may discover the feasibility to be more complicated than anticipated\n\\- Changes in contracts may result in drawn out frontend development times\n\n## Timeline\n\nASAP, ending in 7 cycles.\n\n### Appendix\n\n**![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXeIggMUc4fqFqFMtjX7fZN9rp--BXzSOYrs1dqo9TjQkN5ow7r2XbMwELqFKChjPKmEcHsc9RipidqCHA-9Oy6VzmvUE_vEaxfDPuVM-mLpPJBBwK0JiLFVysC7XoYRB9Ek0tU4Na6kjOnE80OaaTJEnw?key=lzr-dou-7LUnMX28YqWDpg)![Screenshot_2024-06-14_at_10.53.03_pm.png](https://nance.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmbfAD1kqf2D85bsxhQ49GY92uK56kptM1rZA1awp3fidT)![Screenshot_2024-06-14_at_10.54.57_pm.png](https://nance.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmZnmLhTE1AjA4AY5NyvPa6no1XdV5DXUfGfhhhL2Ye5rE)![Screenshot_2024-06-14_at_10.53.55_pm.png](https://nance.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmTezkw36BXQKiG2L2UePoa2WxKMqRT3RdSiU5ou1NYhxx)**\n\n```nance-actions\n--- nance-actions\n- type: Payout\n  uuid: a95c56a36102471bac6ebe2dcec92c42\n  payload:\n    type: project\n    count: \"7\"\n    amountUSD: \"12000\"\n    project: 689\n    address: \"0xAF28bcB48C40dBC86f52D459A6562F658fc94B1e\"\n\n```",

      "content": "![](https://nance.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmQHPpXkPe1P1zDYZbadSikzzdXWQvrbkSUNy3bmnSpUZy)\n\n## Synopsis\n\nFollowing the resounding success of Season 3, the collaboration between Juicebox and [Artizen](https://artizen.fund/) continues with Season 4 of the [Juicebox Project Accelerator Fund](https://artizen.fund/index/mf/juicebox-project-accelerator-fund). Building on the momentum, both Juicebox and Artizen will each contribute $20,000, creating a $40,000 Match Fund aimed at fostering innovative, community-driven projects from top creators. This proposal not only supports new projects through the Accelerator Fund but also enhances Juicebox protocol usage by processing all Ethereum-based sponsorship transactions for all Artizen match funds via Juicebox. This dual approach ensures a substantial increase in the number of transactions and the overall engagement within the Juicebox ecosystem. The previous season attracted 21 amazing projects qualified for the fund and raised an impressive total of Ξ62.69 ($199,083), demonstrating the vibrant potential of this initiative.\n\n## Rationale\n\nArtizen, a match funding platform for breakthroughs in human creativity, has been instrumental in distributing nearly $2 million to more than 1,000 projects, featuring talents like Jessica Chastain and Radiohead’s Jonny Greenwood. Our past collaboration with Juicebox for Season 3 of the Accelerator Fund successfully leveraged a Ξ6 contribution to raise Ξ62.69, of which Ξ13.81 flowed through the Juicebox platform. A renewed Juicebox x Artizen Match Fund for Season 4 anticipates not just sustaining but doubling the number of submissions and funding, driven by our niche community of creators eager to participate and win part of the $40,000 match fund.\nTo further strengthen our collaboration and streamline sponsorship transactions, we propose that all sponsorship contributions made in Ethereum for Artizen be processed and collected via Juicebox. This includes:\n\n* **Juicebox Project Accelerator on Artizen**: All sponsorship transactions will be collected through Juicebox.\n* **All Artizen Match Funds**: Sponsorships will be processed via Juicebox.\n\nBased on the success of Season 3, we anticipate processing at least 120 ETH or $360,000 through Juicebox. Please note that sponsorships made via credit card and bank transfers using USD will not be processed via Juicebox. By migrating all crypto sponsorship transactions to Juicebox, we add significant value to the Juicebox ecosystem, enhancing transparency and fund management. Artizen and Juicebox will go above and beyond to onboard and educate selected projects. Specifically, we'll provide 1:1 support for creators so they understand the value of Juicebox and Artizen to their projects.\n\n**How Artizen works:**\n\n* Creators submit their projects.\n* The community votes on these submissions.\n* The most voted projects are shortlisted.\n* These projects then sell artifacts (NFTs) to raise funds.\n* The match fund is distributed proportionally based on the number of artifacts sold.\n\n## What’s in it for Juicebox?\n\nSeason 3 was a big success, with approximately 350 submissions and nearly $200,000 awarded to qualifying projects. For Season 4, Artizen anticipates doubling these key metrics. The expected outcomes include:\n\n* **At least 50 high-quality projects launching on Juicebox.**\n* **Enhanced access to a community of over 20,000 creators who will launch on Juicebox for transparent fund management.**\n\nAdditionally, by migrating all Ethereum-based sponsorship transactions for all Artizen match funds to Juicebox, we anticipate a significant increase in the use of the Juicebox protocol. This integration will drive more activity and engagement within the Juicebox ecosystem, expanding its reach and impact. To qualify for funding, projects must:\n\n* Launch on Juicebox for transparent fund management.\n* Adopt a community-centric, token-based, or NFT approach via Juicebox.\n* Propose innovative, transformative ideas in any creative field.\n\nSelected projects will receive financial support, technical advice, and access to Juicebox's broad network of creators.\n\n## Big Vision\n\nIn the long term, our vision is to leverage Juicebox to raise the largest endowment in the world for human creativity. The goal is to raise billions and use the yield to fund breakthroughs in art, science, technology, and culture. We're collaborating with leaders in the crypto industry, like Sam Williams, the founder of Arweave, to design the tokenomics. Juicebox will serve as the backbone for this mission, ensuring robust, transparent, and scalable management of the endowment fund. By creating this substantial financial reservoir, we aim to catalyze unprecedented advancements and support a global renaissance of human creativity.\n\n## Rough Timeline\n\n* **May 2024**: Launch Season 4 of the Juicebox Project Accelerator Fund.\n* **June 2024 - July 2024**: Open call for project submissions.

      "title": "JBP-490: Juicebox Project Accelerator Fund for Season 4 of Artizen",
      "content": "![](https://nance.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmPeyVLcbLWh4SSEH8bEFFsYnpTG2a9eSSTFY9tQGBTmqN)\n\n## Synopsis\n\nFollowing the resounding success of Season 3, the collaboration between Juicebox and [Artizen](https://artizen.fund/) continues with Season 4 of the [Juicebox Project Accelerator Fund](https://help.artizen.fund/en/articles/8440213-juicebox-project-accelerator-fund). Building on the momentum, both Juicebox and Artizen will each contribute $20,000, creating a $40,000 Match Fund aimed at fostering innovative, community-driven projects from top creators. The previous season attracted 21 amazing projects qualified for the fund and raised an impressive total of Ξ62.69 ($199,083), demonstrating the vibrant potential of this initiative.\n\n## Rationale\n\n[Artizen](https://www.artizen.fund/), a match funding platform for breakthroughs in human creativity, has been instrumental in distributing nearly $2 million to more than 1,000 projects, featuring talents like Jessica Chastain and Radiohead’s Jonny Greenwood. Our past collaboration with Juicebox for Season 3 of the Accelerator Fund successfully leveraged a Ξ6 contribution to raise Ξ62.69, of which Ξ13.81 flowed through the Juicebox platform. A renewed Juicebox x Artizen Match Fund for Season 4 anticipates not just sustaining but doubling the number of submissions and funding, driven by our niche community of creators eager to participate and win part of the $40,000 match fund.\n\n**How Artizen works:**\n\n* Creators submit their projects.\n* The community votes on these submissions.\n* The most voted projects are shortlisted.\n* These projects then sell artifacts (NFTs) to raise funds.\n* The match fund is distributed proportionally based on the number of artifacts sold.\n\n**What’s in it for Juicebox?**\n\nSeason 3 was a big success, with approximately 350 submissions and nearly $200,000 awarded to qualifying projects. For Season 4, Artizen anticipates doubling these key metrics. The expected outcomes include:\n\n* At least 50 high-quality projects launching on Juicebox.\n* Enhanced access to a community of over 20,000 creators who will launch on Juicebox for transparent fund management.\n\n\n**To qualify for funding, projects must:**\n\n* Launch on Juicebox for transparent fund management.\n* Adopt a community-centric, token-based or NFT approach via Juicebox.\n* Propose innovative, transformative ideas in any creative field.\n\nSelected projects get financial support, technical advice, and access to Juicebox's broad network of creators.\n\nRough timeline:\n\n* April 2024: launch season 4 of the Juicebox Project Accelerator Fund.\n* May 2024 - June 2024: Open call for project submissions. Both Artizen and Juicebox communities review and vote on submissions during this period.\n* July 2024 - August 2024: Selected projects compete for match funding and cash prizes by selling cultural Artifacts as open edition NFTs.\n\n## Specification\n\n* Send $20,000 (\\~6 ETH) from the JuiceboxDAO multisig to the Artizen Juicebox project\n* Artizen will match an additional $20,000 (\\~6 ETH) into the Artizen Juicebox project\n* All funds will be paid from Artizen Juicebox project, into individual creator Juicebox projects\n\n## Further Reading\n\n1.

      "title": "JBP-488: Renew recurring payout for zhape.eth",
      "content": "## Synopsis\n\nRenew recurring payout for zhape.eth.\n\n## Motivation\n\nI want to continue contributing to JuiceboxDAO, help expanding the adoption of Juicebox protocol, and support the coordination in our ecosystem.\n\n## Specification\n\nPay zhape.eth US$500 equivalent of ETH and 250,000 JBX each funding cycle, for total 8 FCs. JBX payments can be made every 2 cycles to reduce burden for the multisig. \n\n## Rationale\n\n### What I have done in the last payout period\n\n1. As the Town Hall of Juicebox DAO has turned on a slower tempo, I have made just a handful of summaries during last payout period: [https://docs.juicebox.money/town-hall/](https://docs.juicebox.money/town-hall/) and [https://docs.juicebox.money/zh/town-hall/](https://docs.juicebox.money/zh/town-hall/).\n2. At the beginning of each governance cycle, I post threaded Chinese tweets, and share summaries of those new proposals so that people can get the gist of them before they want get more engaged, in a hope to help increase governance involvement from more token holders.[https://twitter.com/zhape1112](https://twitter.com/zhape1112)\n3. I translated some articles concerning JBX, Retailism and Revnets into Chinese on [https://zhape.eth.limo/](https://zhape.eth.limo/) and shared them with cn community. Recently I am also trying to share some of my thoughts / perspectives into blogposts.\n4. A mod in the JuiceboxDAO Discord CN channels. I have been sharing updated info of Juicebox ecosystem with our members, as well as answering their questions and etc. I have been trying to smooth out communication and support efforts in proposal submitting, in order to get their opinions heard and move them closer into our community activities.\n\n### What I plan to do in the new payout period\n\n1. Town hall these days are not happening regularly, I should not try to get compensated for this job. But I will follow closely all the updates in our ecosystem, and relay them to other community members, so that they can get most up-to-date info about the developments in our ecosystem, and join our discussions on a timely basis if they feel interested.\n2. I want to write more about all the different working mechanisms in our ecosystem, because I want people in the rest of the world can understand more about Juicebox and appreciate its meaning to our common future. Also, as now it seems JuiceboxDAO will be more aligned with the development of Bananapus and Revnets in the future, I want to help tell those stories, support users' more active interaction with applications like Bannyverse, Defifa, Croptop, Revnet and etc.\n3. As the proposal to stop $JBX new issuance has been approved and executed by the DAO, I want get more involved in the discussions for our future improvements to the tokenomic model. This is a pivotal moment in DAO's development, I want to be a part of these efforts to make Juicebox great.\n4. Support all the needs of our community members, such as proposal making, internal communication, governance involvement enhancement, and etc. Try to host some sessions to exchange information or opinions with CN community members when the timing is right.\n5. I feel my job as a moderator in our Discord CN server is quite meaningful, I want to keep on working to help deepen mutual understanding, reconcile relationship, serve to help those members' voices heard, and work for their reasonable benefits.\n\n## Risks\n\nI am not responsible for my job, or I fail to deliver what I promised.\n\n## Timeline\n\nIf approved, this proposal will take effect from FC #72, and end after FC#79.\n\n## Proposed Actions\n\n\n1. *Juicebox Payout* [zhape.eth](https://etherscan.io/address/0x5706d5aD7A68bf8692bD341234bE44ca7Bf2f654) $500 for 8 cycles\n2. *Transfer* 250000 [0x4554CC10898f92D45378b98D6D6c2dD54c687Fb2](https://etherscan.io/address/0x4554CC10898f92D45378b98D6D6c2dD54c687Fb2) to [zhape.eth](https://etherscan.io/address/0x5706d5aD7A68bf8692bD341234bE44ca7Bf2f654)\n\n*actions appended to proposal body by [Nance](https://nance.app/s/juicebox)*",

Juicehammer prevents spam, scams, and impersonation in the JuiceboxDAO Discord server. It currently uses fuzzy text matching to mute users with suspicious names, and perceptual hashing of profile pictures to block users which impersonate contributors. This payout should be sent upon the delivery of:\n\n1. Muting users which spam across many channels.\n2. Content-based spam prevention with simple text heuristics.\n3. Content-based spam prevention with a neural network spam classifier. I'll continue to collect data and upgrade this over time.\n\nI'm confident we can get to >90% spam prevention with these upgrades.\n\n### Juicearizer\n\nSend `filipv.eth` $5,000 and 2m JBX upon the delivery of a Discord bot which lets anyone summarize town halls (or any other meetings) without my help. Recordings, transcriptions, and summaries will automatically be uploaded to a GitHub repository using git LFS. This will replace the JuiceboxDAO Notion, allowing us to close it down and stop paying for that subscription.\n\n## Proposed Actions\n\n\n1. *Juicebox Payout* [filipv.eth](https://etherscan.io/address/0x30670D81E487c80b9EDc54370e6EaF943B6EAB39) $821 for 6 cycles\n\n*actions appended to proposal body by [Nance](https://nance.app/s/juicebox)*",

      "title": "JBP-487: $NANA Go-To-Market",
      "content": "## Synopsis\n\nJuiceboxDAO ($JBX holders) should fund a 30 day go-to-market of the new $NANA (Juicebox v4) omnichain system during the month of April 2024, including audits, bug bash contests, a hackathon, and stress test for the revnets and bannyverse ecosystems built on the Juicebox core foundation. Meanwhile, we'll be driving traffic to testnet web client experiences and APIs as we begin marketing what we've been up to and as we prove out a bug-free dress rehersal of production environments across chains. Committing time and budget now will turn out cheaper than risk-mitigation on the fly over time.\n\nIt will do so by allocating a basket of Banny NFTs, $BANNY and $NANA tokens, ETH, and $JBX.\n\nAuthored by Jango.\n\n## Motivation\n\nMany long standing JB ecosystem research, prototyping, and implementation are about to set sail. It's a great time to recruit cross-functional staff from active DAO members, and committed auditors, hackers, and users from outside, to get everything ready to ship.\n\n#### Goals\n\n* Run $NANA and $BANNY omnichain testnet revnets for 7 consecutive days bug free.\n<br>\n* Get people to play with omnichain revnets and bannyverse mints on testnets through clients such as the revnet app, juicescan, and the bannyverse minter, and through contract APIs directly.\n<br>\n* Spend a month code complete, focusing entirely on security, risk mitigation, documentation, and stress testing integrations with audits, a bug bash contest, and a hackathon soliciting hooks and peripheral components that may inform the core hook design tweaks.\n<br>\n* Grow the launch anticipation through distribution of cherished cultural Bannys to those who're putting in the love.\n<br>\n* Actively communicate the extent of what is being deployed to the outside world, in thoughtful ways with stories that resonate.\n<br>\n* Complete a thorough subgraph database for applications to use.\n<br>\n* By giving away a chunk of JBDAO's assets to folks who will steward their narrative, it's doing a service to the portion of the assets it's keeping.\n\nWe will fund this effort with a few different asset types. Remember that once the $BANNY revnet is deployed in production, JuiceboxDAO will use 40 ETH to buy Naked Bannys from it and will receive $BANNY alongside.\n\n#### Budget\n\n* 16 Alien Bannys (out of 30 Alien Bannys it will have, costing 30 ETH of the 40 ETH JBDAO will spend.)\n<br>\n* 48 Pink Bannys (out of 80 Pink Bannys it will have, costing 8 ETH of the 40 ETH JBDAO will spend.)\n<br>\n* 92 Orange Bannys (out of 200 Orange Bannys it will have, costing 2 ETH of the 40 ETH JBDAO will spend.)\n<br>\n* 40m $BANNY tokens (out of 60m $BANNY tokens it will have, from premint of 20m and from contributing 40 ETH)\n<br>\n* 79k $NANA tokens (out of 37,000,000 $NANA it will have from the premint)\n<br>\n* $151k USD of ETH\n<br>\n* 16.5m $JBX\n\nWe will use this budget to compensate security and marketing efforts.\n\n#### Staffing & Allocation\n\n* 4 Alien Bannys, 12 pink Bannys, 12m $BANNY, 32k $NANA, $24k of ETH, 12m $JBX split to contract crew (jango, DrG, 0xBa5ed, nowonder) to manage the month of stress tests – bug finding contest, test writing, and a hackathon. We'll be full throttle for the month. The NFTs, $BANNY, and $NANA assets are only cherished if the infrastructure being tested holds.\n    * Auditors and hackathonists will be asking questions about how things work, and throw potential findings are us all month. We need to be responsive to these and make adjustments on the fly if needed.\n    * We need to continue throwing everything we've got at the codebase, including more edge case unit testing and integration testing for each component.\n    * We'll be putting up new deploys weekly that reflect that week's findings.\n    * $24k of ETH and 12m $JBX paid upfront to Emergency Devs multisig (0xd0a12b8279614A46b75Dc23DBB3245094a3f2A49) for further distribution amount stated participants. Bannys, $BANNY, and $NANA allocated to this same multisig once acquired after a successful deploy.\n<br>\n* 2 aliens, 2 pink Bannys, 2m $BANNY, 4k $NANA, $8k of ETH to great documentation for those learning, auditing, hacking, and otherwise using the core omnichain stack and peripheral components (filip, jango).\n    * API docs for each component\n    * Overview doc for each component\n    * Multichain architecture docs\n    * Integration guides\n    * New user docs\n    * Update the old docs\n    * $8k of ETH to 0xb9459B4248f585909EA6fB9E91C4576A84750fC2. Bannys, $BANNY, and $NANA allocated to the same address once acquired.\n<br>\n* 3 aliens, 6 pink Bannys, 3m $BANNY, 6k $NANA, $9k of ETH to help collect/organize client-side bugs, tell the story of whats going on with $NANA and $BANNY, the Banny NFTs' underlying infra, and making internal happenings accessible to the outside world (matthew & brileigh & sage). Ramp up content production, maybe quick hitting interviews with builders, etc. Lets make sure everyone knows what's happening, and the public's interaction points work beautifully.\n    * Attract hackers and testnet users to come play on the new omnichain infra.\n    * Explain wtf $BANNY and $NANA are and how they fit into $JBX, using visuals and narratives.\n    * Help inwardly focused developers and community members share their POVs on the systems with the outside world, making the project more relatable.\n    * Help collect bugs on the UI/UX side of things as users play with it all.\n    * $6k of ETH to Juicecast JB project, and $3k of ETH to sagekellyn.eth upfront. Bannys, $BANNY, and $NANA allocated 2/3 to Juicecast, 1/3 to Sage once acquired.\n* 4 aliens, 14 pink Bannys, 50 orange Bannys, 5m $BANNY, 5k $NANA, $70k of ETH as rewards for bug bashers, auditors, and hackathonists managed by contract crew. Contract crew is assessing auditors and will be responsible for allocating these funds, while contract crew also manages the hackathon. We will pay auditors 70k (50%) upfront and give them an option of 70k after their work is complete OR receiving a basket of assets listed above. If ETH is chosen instead of the assets, we're proposing JBDAO contribute another 70k worth of ETH and take back the allocated basket of assets into its treasury. Part of the fun for bug hunters is learning how all these assets fit into the stack they're auditing.\n    * \\~8800 lines of code, done by 2-4 indy auditors separately (we'll post info about who they are asap), with mitigation report deliverables and a commitment to work with contract crew to revise anything that needs love. Auditor candidates include: vnmrtz ([https://github.com/Elpacos/audits](https://github.com/Elpacos/audits \"https://github.com/Elpacos/audits\")), 0xWeiss ([https://github.com/maarcweiss](https://github.com/maarcweiss \"https://github.com/maarcweiss\")), Chimay ([https://github.com/chinmay-farkya](https://github.com/chinmay-farkya \"https://github.com/chinmay-farkya\")), Nirlin ([https://code4rena.com/@nirlin](https://code4rena.com/@nirlin \"https://code4rena.com/@nirlin\")), and 33Audits ([https://github.com/leeftk](https://github.com/leeftk \"https://github.com/leeftk\")).\n    * $70k of ETH upfront to Emergency Devs multisig (0xd0a12b8279614A46b75Dc23DBB3245094a3f2A49). Bannys, $BANNY, and $NANA allocated to this same multisig once acquired after a successful audits and deploys.\n<br>\n* 1 Alien, 3 Pinks, 20 Oranges, 10m $BANNY, 10k $NANA, $15k USD of ETH, and 1m $JBX as a raffle/airdrop or other recruiting/growth effort by brileigh and matthew.\n    * testnet + social incentives e.g. add 🍌 to your display name, follow `/banny` channel, complete testnet transaction\n    * meme incentives e.g. share your custom banny, share your banny meme\n    * edu incentives e.g. share a thread and/or infographic on how revnets and/or $BANNY works\n    * $degen in-app tips for completing testnet transactions, share your banny meme or art\n    * interface bugs and UI/UX incentives e.g. find a bug on revnet.app or banny minter\n    * hackathon recruiting/rewarding, running ads for examples of stuff that can be built. even if people dont join the hackathon, it shows what JB is to people.\n    * $15k of ETH and 1m $JBX upfront to juicecast.eth\n* 2 alien Bannys, 5 pink Bannys, 10 orange bannys, 2m $BANNY, 10k $NANA, $16k USD of ETH, and 2m $JBX split to Revnet implementers (aeolian, jango) for tightening the omnichain revnet experience, which are heavily depended on for the financial aspects of $NANA and $BANNY. Revnet already has a milestone based budget that stays in effect, with next milestones being after production deployment.\n    * Revnet.app currently works well for single-chain revnets (dash and create flow). we need to extend this to omnichain revnets.\n    * As testnet feedback rolls in, we need to iterate and tighten.\n    * $8k of ETH to Breadfruit JB project, and $8k of ETH to aeolian.eth upfront. 1m $JBX to breadfruit.eth and 1m $JBX to aeolian.eth upfront. Bannys, $BANNY, and $NANA allocated to this spread after a successful deploys.\n<br>\n* 6 pink Bannys, 12 orange bannys, 6m $BANNY, 12k $NANA, and $9k USD of ETH, and 1.5m $JBX split to omnichain interop builders (0xBa5ed, Jango, and filip). The bulk of the omnichain components have already been built and funded through the most recent bananapus proposal, however the odds and ends of the omnichain components are proving demanding and require more funding to get stuff across many chains.\n    * We've currently got a working prototype of merkle proof generation server that allows users of a revnet on one chain to suck into another chain. We need to tighten this server for production and include it into revnet and juicescan interfaces in a way that is smoothbrain for casual users who'll be testing during the month.\n    * $4k of ETH to 0xba5ed.eth, $2.5k of ETH to Breadfruit JB project, $2.5k of ETH to filipv.eth upfront. 0.8m $JBX to 0xba5ed.eth, 0.35m $JBX to breadfruit.eth, 0.35m $JBX to filipv.eth upfront. Bannys, $BANNY, and $NANA allocated to this spreadafter a successful deploys.\n\n#### Contract repositories bein",

      "title": "JBP-484 - Stop the issuance of $JBX token and put an end to $JBX inflation（停止$JBX代币发行，从而停止$JBX通胀)",
      "content": "## Synopsis 概要\n\nStop the issuance of $JBX token by setting the issuance reduction rate as 0% and the discounted weight as 1, in order to put an end to the inflation of $JBX.\n\n将 issuance reduction rate 设置为 0，将权重系数 weight 设置为 1，从而停止 $JBX 代币发行，以此停止$ JBX 通胀。\n\n## Motivation 动机\n\nCurrent issues:\n\n$JBX has been in the face of a hidden danger with unlimited inflation, rendering FDV impossible to be estimated or controlled, which makes it the case that very few sophisticated investors are considering $JBX as an option to put their funds to. This problem has been manifested quite obviously in the liquidity pool of $JBX, where most of the price increases came from transactions by Buyback Delegate (abbr.: BBD) instead of independent investors. With the implementation of BBD, the market price of $JBX did get elevated to some extent, but as it is getting closer to its issuance rate, the investment value of $JBX is also decreasing in tandem. It will be very unrealistic to see new incoming investors in the foreseeable future.\n\nThe merits of this change:\n\n1\\. $JBX will not have inflation after its issuance is stopped\\, which will in turn boost the investment value of $JBX by a very large margin\\.\n\n2\\. Increased investment value of $JBX can attract more involvement into the ecosystem\\, realizing an effect of self\\-marketing\\, which will be favorable for the further expansion of our community\\.\n\n3\\. Increased price of $JBX helps incrementing treasury funds\\, which will be favorable for accruing funds to support the long\\-term building of the project\\.\n\n4\\. The treasury can still take in $JBX through reserved rate\\, when necessary\\, $JBX in the treasury can be sold to increase its ETH assets\\, hence elevating $JBX's redemption value\\.\n\n<br>\n当前的问题：\n\n一直以来$JBX面临着无限通胀的隐患，从而导致FDV无法预估和控制，因此有经验的投资人不会考虑对$JBX进行投资。这一问题，很明显的表现在他的流动性上，目前的价格抬升大部分只是由于BBD执行带来的，而非由独立投资人购买达成。随着BBD的执行，目前$JBX有所抬升，随着$JBX加个越来越靠近issuance rate，$JBX的投资价值进一步减弱，预计很难有投资人愿意进入。\n\n改进的好处：\n\n1\\. 停止$JBX发行，$JBX将不再通胀，会大幅提升$JBX的投资价值\n\n2\\. $JBX投资价值提升，可以吸引更多人进入，可以形成self\\-marketing的作用，有利于社区壮大\n\n3\\. $JBX价格提升，有利于国库资金提升，有利于积累资金长期支持项目建设\n\n4\\. 国库依然可以通过reserved rate来回收$JBX，在必要的时候国库可以通过卖出$JBX来提升国库$ETH储备，从而提升赎回价格\n\n## Specification 执行细节\n\nAfter the proposal is approved, set \\`weight\\` to \\`1\\` and \\`discountRate\\` to \\`0\\`, thus completely putting an end to the issuance of $JBX token starting from next cycle.\n\n投票通过后，可立即将issuance reduction rate设置为0，将权重系数weight设置为1，从而从下一周期开始停止$JBX代币发行\n\n## Rationale 理据\n\n1\\. Only some configurations will be required\\, leaving the current process intact\\, the $JBX distribution to projects paying protocol fees thereafter will rely upon the execution of BBD\\.\n\n2\\. The treasury will still be able to carry out its accrual of $JBX through the control of reserved rate\\, and the redemption value can be ensured by swapping $JBX in the treasury into $ETH\\.\n\n1\\. 只需要修改配置，并不改变现有流程，修改后$JBX发行将依赖于BBD来达成\n\n2\\. 金库依然可以通过控制reserved rate来进行$JBX积累，赎回价格可以通过出售国库的$JBX为$ETH来保障\n\n## Risks 风险\n\nAfter the issuance is stopped, there will only be inflow of reserved $JBX to the treasury through the execution of BBD and no other assets will be taken in, which might leave the redemption value of $JBX unable to be secured. This risk can be mitigated through swapping $JBX in the treasury into $ETH in the future. Overall, I think the risks of this proposal are foreseeable and can be put under proper control.\n\n停止 issuance 之后，将只有通过 BBD 的执行获得的保留 $JBX 会流入国库，其他资金将不再流入国库，可能导致赎回价无法得到保障。对于这一风险，可以通过售出国库中的 $JBX 为$ ETH 来解决。总体来说，我认为这个方案的风险是可预见，并且是可控的。\n\n## Timeline 时间线\n\nCome into effect right after this proposal gets approved.\n\n提案获得批准之后立即生效。",

We’ve seen a lot of growth and had a few viral projects surpass expectations, as the market heats up these insane volume spikes will likely continue to happen, bringing a tonne of new users into the JB ecosystem.\n\nAs with any application across the web, a meaningful and enjoyable user experience is key to building trust (especially important in crypto) as well as ensuring high user conversion and retention rates. What we currently have works, but there is much to be improved upon to ensure users get the best possible experience across the app as it continues to grow (outlined below).\n\n##### Points to address\n\n* Checkout experience\n* NFT minting experience\n* Improvement and optimisation of JBM mobile user experience\n* Conversion rate optimisation (what stops people from paying a project?)\n* Project page UX — clarity, usability, navigation, language.\n* Activity feed\n* Landing page trending project improvements\n* Refinement of overall JBM user experience based on critical feedback and data of the past 3-4 months\n\n##### Timeline Breakdown\n\n**Phase 1 – Evaluation**\n\n* Evaluation — gathering data & feedback\n* User interviews + usability testing\n* Research, planning and analysis of data & testing results\n* Defining the most critical points to address based on the data\n* Solution mapping\n\n**Phase 2 – Design**\n\n* Design for most critical improvements based on the data from Phase 1\n* High-fidelity design refinement and feedback\n* Development handoff\n\n**Phase 3 – Development**\n\n* Development of improvements based on data-backed UI designs\n* Code QA\n\n**Phase 4 – Launch**\n\n* Usability testing & feedback\n* Launch latest update\n\n(Repeat phases 2-4 as necessary for each improvement over the 6 Cycles)\n\n### **Specification**\n\nPay US$7900 (in ETH) per Cycle to JuiceTech for 6 Cycles\n\n### **Rationale**\n\nHaving actively contributed to Juicebox (via Peel DAO) and helping build JBM over the last \\~1.5 years Strath & Wraeth are some of the few people that possess an in-depth understanding of the Juicebox protocol and its complex interface requirements — this allows us to work fast and efficiently to align user needs and protocol features.\n\n**A few examples of our previous work include:**\n\n* Complete design and build of new [juicebox.money](http://juicebox.money) website\n* Iconic brand refresh for Juicebox — including updated logo, typography, colours, style guide and app design system.\n    ![JB BRAND](https://nance.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmVYMAMYU2kbPVGiYyQx8NapL5rp8VjbSNBB1VshWnArms)\n* Design and build of new JBM project page and new checkout system.

      "title": "JBP-482 - Allow PonziDAO to Recover Funds",
      "content": "## Synopsis\n\nApprove [PonziDAO's project](https://juicebox.money/p/ponzidao) in the rescue terminal, allowing them to recover ~4.5 ETH from a permanently locked cycle.\n\n## Motivation\n\nFrom nizo, the project's owner:\n\n> We created a juicebox to raise funds within a small French NFT telegram community, and invited members to participate in a NFT degen adventure. We weren't very familiar with the process, and after Cycle 1 we intended to stop funding, but some people kept sending, and we've been unable to access funds ever since. That adventure is now over, and we're in the process of reimbursing users, but those 4,5 ethers are still lost in space, and we seem to have no solution for recovering them.\n\nThe funds are locked in a cycle which is permanently locked. Redemptions are disabled, meaning that if JuiceboxDAO does not allow PonziDAO to rescue the funds, the funds will be locked permanently.\n\n## Specification\n\nCall `toggleRescue(...)` on the mainnet `TerminalV1Rescue` contract [`0xE05605882C3F34B4Ef3586D70dE294f3f9654Ee8`](https://etherscan.io/address/0xE05605882C3F34B4Ef3586D70dE294f3f9654Ee8), specifying the PonziDAO project ID (140).\n\n## Rationale\n\nThis will allow PonziDAO to recover the funds through the [v1.1-recovery frontend](https://github.com/jbx-protocol/v1.1-recovery) with the process simulated [here on Tenderly](https://dashboard.tenderly.co/explorer/fork/b30de472-2b55-4844-a88f-00c15145c9fd/transactions).\n\n## Risks\n\nThis would be the second time JuiceboxDAO has completed a v1 rescue, but this could still establish a dangerous precedent. The funds are permanently locked, and we may be missing context – the community may have locked the funds intentionally.\n\nHowever, if JuiceboxDAO doesn't act, the funds are locked forever and cannot be recovered, as redemptions from the project are disabled.\n\n## Timeline\n\nTo be executed within the 14 days following the proposal's approval.\n\n## Proposed Actions\n\n\n1.

      "title": "JBP-472 - $6.5k Juicebox Denver Launchpad",
      "content": "## Synopsis\n\n*Provide $6.5k DAI for a \"Juicebox Launchpad\" during ETH Denver, used for:*\n\n\\- $5k for a JB hub space from Feb 22 \\- March 5 where community members and invitees can hold workshops\\, make stuff\\, have game nights\\, arts and crafts\\, hangouts\\, cooking seshs\\, etc\\. The space will be stocked with juiceboxs and bananas\\. Jango will manage this budget and has already locked in a space that is conveniently located and comfortable\\.\n\n\\- $1\\.5k for JB/banny t\\-shirts and hats\\. Sage will manage this budget\\.\n\n## Motivation\n\nETH Denver is a pre-eminent Ethereum conference, and many JB community members have signaled their intent to be present.\nWhile the conference has an \"actual\" agenda, the majority of its substance happens at side events around town where several communities get together to hang, talk, think, sketch, build, and dream.\nGiven community presence, JB should have a comfortable default space that folks can invite people to for formal and informal gatherings, while also serving as a home base as we mingle with other Ethernauts in town. We should especially be looking to connect with folks who have built projects on Juicebox over the years, or helped the mission in other indirect ways.\n\nAs we gather in person, we should celebrate our culture with merch and goody bags as we did in New York for the ice cream pop up. Those images and tank tops remain iconic.\n\n## Specification\n\n*Send jango.eth $5k stable USD coins (DAI or USDC).*\nSend sagekellyn.eth $1.5k stable USD coins *(DAI or USDC).*\n\n## Rationale\n\n*Straight forward.*\n\n## Risks\n\n*IRL event incidentals always turn out more expensive than anticipated. Those coming to Denver should not expect this budget to cover their individual costs.*\n\n## Timeline\n\nAsap\n\n## Proposed Actions\n\n\n1. *Transfer* 1500 [0xA0b86991c6218b36c1d19D4a2e9Eb0cE3606eB48](https://etherscan.io/address/0xA0b86991c6218b36c1d19D4a2e9Eb0cE3606eB48) to [sagekellyn.eth](https://etherscan.io/address/0x90eda5165e5E1633E0Bdb6307cDecaE564b10ff7)\n2. *Transfer* 5000 [0xA0b86991c6218b36c1d19D4a2e9Eb0cE3606eB48](https://etherscan.io/address/0xA0b86991c6218b36c1d19D4a2e9Eb0cE3606eB48) to [jango.eth](https://etherscan.io/address/0x823b92d6a4b2AED4b15675c7917c9f922ea8ADAD)\n\n*actions appended to proposal body by [Nance](https://nance.app/s/juicebox)*",

By leading recent campaigns including Juicecrowd (JC01) and Free Alexey & Roman, Matthew and Brileigh have demonstrated that they are uniquely positioned to drive protocol adoption and project success. The DAO should continue to fund these efforts and allocate JBX to M+B so that incentives are properly aligned moving forward.\n\n## Recent Work\n\n### 🌪️ Free Alexey & Roman\n\n![Free Alexey & Roman project page on juicebox.money](https://nance.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/Qmadp9ozUPHqYVhxqGqEPbZ2TY3CdiSTVKHZgjsANgmH18)\n[https://juicebox.money/@free-pertsev-and-storm](https://juicebox.money/@free-pertsev-and-storm)\n\nM+B worked closely with the [WeWantJusticeDAO](https://wewantjusticedao.org/) team and JBDAO members (TJL, Wraeth, Filip, Aeolian, and others) to launch a project to raise funds for Alexey Pertsev and Roman Storm’s legal defense.

Working with a hand-picked cohort of eight projects, the JC01 campaign raised over $269k USD (119 ETH) from 200+ individual payments.\n\n![Juicecrowd (JC01) homepage](https://nance.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmQHW5gUwdWGdXqbMVZHpckiwD1dHZUp1oecrt384MsdRs)\n[https://www.juicecrowd.gg/](https://www.juicecrowd.gg/)\n\n![Juicecrowd on The Dapp List](https://nance.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmNuUyUe3SvRgotcadx5hjfJHgdkckkK34u5ZX8yhtfJuW)\n[https://thedapplist.com/project/juicecrowd](https://thedapplist.com/project/juicecrowd)\n\nM+B successfully submitted Juicecrowd to [The Dapp List](https://thedapplist.com/project/juicecrowd) and earned [Top Project of The Week](https://newsletter.thedapplist.com/p/product-updates-42).

Our efforts via [@juicebox_money](https://twitter.com/juicebox_money) (Twitter/X), [@juicebox](https://warpcast.com/juicebox) (FC), and our personal accounts have significantly contributed to this. The [@juicebox_money](https://twitter.com/juicebox_money) follower count has nearly tripled and earned over 120k impressions in both December 2023 and January 2024.\n\n![JBM Twitter analytics](https://nance.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmfY4c8kP7p1HXsoLvTRHcZmHDL1jHFrXVy23o3jMfzRZ8)\n[https://twitter.com/juicebox_money](https://twitter.com/juicebox_money)\n\nIn addition to promoting projects gaining traction on Juicebox (e.g. [CryoDAO](https://juicebox.money/@cryodao), [MijaniDAO](https://juicebox.money/@mijanidao)), JBM Twitter has also been an excellent outlet for JBX education like the post below which helps explain the Buyback contract and how it benefits JBX holders:\n\n![Twitter post about the Buyback contract and MijaniDAO](https://nance.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmQxi9KHcjYdU3rngcefBqRN9n6CYajooi5UUE8s97vwgj)\n[https://x.com/juicebox_money/status/1745612160871346676](https://x.com/juicebox_money/status/1745612160871346676?s=20)\n\n## Upcoming Work\n\n### 🌪️ Free Alexey & Roman\n\nThe campaign for Alexey Pertsev and Roman Storm’s legal defense is scheduled to run until February 22nd, but [WeWantJusticeDAO](https://wewantjusticedao.org/) has expressed interest in extending the campaign. We will continue to lead the campaign and work closely with their team, including (but not limited to):\n\n* Managing the Free Alexey & Roman [Discord](https://discord.gg/MesT6EPpeJ)\n* Posting campaign updates from [@FreeAlexeyRoman](https://twitter.com/FreeAlexeyRoman) on Twitter and [@juicebox](https://warpcast.com/juicebox) on Farcaster\n* Releasing Juicecast episode 34 with [Ameen Soleimani](https://twitter.com/ameensol) from [WeWantJusticeDAO](https://wewantjusticedao.org/) and clips\n* Leading campaign outreach to seek donations from notable developers, influencers, companies/organizations, and DAOs. Some examples of current leads in progress include Coinbase, Arbitrum DAO, Seed Club, Tally, and Alchemix DAO.\n\n### 🧃 JBX ecosystem education\n\n* Produce much more educational material on $JBX, Buyback contract, treasury-backed tokens, and ecosystem projects\n* Release upcoming Juicecast episodes: Haz & Bryce (Brume Wallet) and Jango\n* Applied to speak at ETH Denver 2024 about Juicebox, treasury-backed tokens, and Revnets\n\n## Expenses\n\nFor the last year, M+B have incurred the following recurring expenses as contributors to JBDAO:\n\n* Twitter Premium+ ([@juicebox_money](https://twitter.com/juicebox_money)) = $16.00 USD per month\n* Twitter Premium+ ([@FreeAlexeyRoman](https://twitter.com/FreeAlexeyRoman)) = $16.00 USD per month\n* Adobe CC suite (2 seats) = $109.98 USD per month\n* Riverside Pro = $29.00 USD per month\n* Canva Pro (1 seat) = $14.99 USD per month\n* MailerLite Growing Business plan = $10.00 USD per month\n* CapCut Pro = $7.99 USD per month\n\n## Specification\n\nAdd $4500 USD recurring payout from ruleset 69 to ruleset 76 (inclusive) to project ID 552 ([https://juicebox.money/@juicecast](https://juicebox.money/@juicecast)) and transfer 10M JBX from the multisig to `juicecast.eth`.\n\n## Rationale\n\nWe are proposing to renew our payout to reflect our continued workload and commitment to the Juicebox ecosystem. The USD amount per ruleset has been lowered by 25% with a JBX allocation included to align incentives as we help campaigns succeed.\n\n## Risks\n\nMatthew might lose his streak in the gm channel (currently 677).\n\n## Timeline\n\nThis proposal should take effect in ruleset 69 (nice) and last eight (8) rulesets.\n\n## Proposed Actions\n\n\n1. *Juicebox Payout* [Juicebox Project 552](https://juicebox.money/v2/p/552) $4,500 for 8 cycles\n2. *Transfer* 10000000 [0x4554CC10898f92D45378b98D6D6c2dD54c687Fb2](https://etherscan.io/address/0x4554CC10898f92D45378b98D6D6c2dD54c687Fb2) to [juicecast.eth](https://etherscan.io/address/0x2fBdC6075f5b8046380D0542A7bd7f22EBFE36fc)\n\n*actions appended to proposal body by [Nance](https://nance.app/s/juicebox)*",

      "content": "## Synopsis\n\nGive the JuiceboxDAO multisig permission to process a project's fees if at least 60% of signers explicitly agree to do so.\n\n## Motivation\n\nJuicebox projects have the option to *hold fees*, allowing them to pay out ETH and keep the fees locked within the terminal until the ETH is re-added. This is useful for projects which would like the option to give a full refund later on, but some projects enable this feature without needing it, allowing fees to build up. The more ETH a project pays in fees at once, the greater the slippage on any resulting $JBX purchases grows. This means that the project will receive less $JBX than they otherwise would, and that JuiceboxDAO will receive less reserved $JBX from the transaction.\n\nSome projects may not want to process fees, or be unable to due to external circumstances (like [CryoDAO](https://juicebox.money/@cryodao) has been lately).\n\nJuiceboxDAO should have a simple process in place for managing this in-between governance cycles, which can cause responses to take too long.\n\nFrom Kai (CryoDAO):\n\n> this is smart for a number of reasons - one for us is the uncertainty of the transaction builder / manually processing the fees without being fully aware of how it all works\n> if we could say \"hey juicebox we're ready to process fees now pls go ahead\" that would be awesome\n\n## Sunset Clause\n\nThis proposal should only apply until January 1st, 2025.",

      "content": "## Synopsis\n\nProvide $20,500 initial funding for Juicebox V4 frontend public goods, including an SDK and barebones source-of-truth interface.\n\n## Motivation\n\nA number of dapps are set to run on Juicebox v4, including revnet.app, defifa.net, one day juicebox.money, and likely more.\n\nWhen developing dapps, two sets of tooling are useful:\n\n* **a source-of-truth interface**, that accurately presents all of a Juicebox project's information. This allows developers to cross-check their own apps against a trusted source.\n* **an SDK**, to maximise time-to-market and developer efficiency.\n\nThese both exist for Juicebox V3: juicebox.money is the source of truth, and we now have a V3 SDK used in production by juicecrowd.gg. These **will not** support Juicebox V4 for the forseable future.\n\nI propose we build similar tools for Juicebox V4.\n\n**Tooling specification**\n\n* Develop **juicescan.io**, a barebones, feature-minimal browser for Juicebox V4 projects. It will show every possible detail about a Juicebox project, intended to be a source of truth for developers and analysts. It will only support the core juice-contracts-v4 and no extensions for the initial build.\n*  Develop **juice-sdk-v4**. An SDK comprised of 2 packages:\n    * **core**, a thin wrapper on **viem** that provides utilities for working with Juicebox in any Javascript environment (server or client-side, any framework)\n    * **react**, a set of React hooks and components that make building a Juicebox dapp in React easier.\n\n**Can we do without these tools?**\nWithout these tools, the following outcomes are likely:\n\n* if there's no way to check if a dapp is presenting accurate information, developers will be using Etherscan, which is very tedious when working with Juicebox contracts.\n* without an SDK, developers must learn the Juicebox contracts deeply. Aside from the extra time required, there's a risk of incorrect implementation, leading to bugs down the road.\n\n\nIt is possible to proceed without these tools. But we aren't setting ourselves up to win.\n\n## Specification\n\nAllocate US$20k to this project, across the following payout schedule.\n\n\\- US$10\\,000 to codalabs\\.eth \\(aeolian\\) up\\-front\n\\- US$5\\,500 to codalabs\\.eth \\(aeolian\\) upon release of SDK\n\\- US$5\\,000 to codalabs\\.eth \\(aeolian\\) upon release of juicescan\\.io\n\n**SDK release criteria**\nMust be feature-parity with juice-sdk-v3 and support all features reasonably required for a general juicebox Dapp.\n\n**juicescan.io release criteria**\n\\- must show all the juicebox project info\\, accurately\n\\- must support all networks that the juicebox v4 contracts are deployed on\n\\- no juicebox extensions required initially \\(buy\\-back\\-delegate\\, NFTs\\, etc\\)\n\nIt will be the discretion of the JuiceboxDAO multisig to determine if these criteria are met.\n\n## Rationale\n\nMilestone-based payout is to incentivize successful delivery of the project.\n\n**NOTE: these are estimates.** A base rate of $2,500 per week for initial development, and $500 per week for minor fixes and improvements yields the following:\n\n* **Juice-sdk =>** 2500 \\* 3 + 500 \\* 8 = 11,500\n* **Juicescan =>** 2500 \\* 2 + 500 \\* 8 = 9000\n\nTotal = $20,500\n\n## Risks\n\n\\- Without ongoing funding\\, tooling may not have long\\-term support \\(both tools will be free and open\\-source\\, however\\)\n\\- Tooling may not provide developers with all the resources they need initially\\.\n\n## Timeline\n\nImmediately.\n\n## Proposed Actions\n\n\n1. *Juicebox Payout* [codalabs.eth](https://etherscan.io/address/0x1bb1e3F6818FeB7c1F1674e6E7D6c30BA2725643) $10,000 for 1 cycle\n\n*actions appended to proposal body by [Nance](https://nance.app/s/juicebox)*",

      "content": "## Synopsis\n\nPay $6,175 per FC to maintain the juicebox.money website (JBM).\n\n## Motivation\n\nJBM is an essential and valuable asset to Juicebox DAO and JBX. It remains the primary gateway to the Juicebox protocol.\n\nBut like the Juicebox protocol, JBM has reached a stage where large updates are scarcely needed. We believe that, given the great work done by the JB and Peel teams to date, JBM will continue to serve the DAO mission statement in improving market conditions, as long as it is kept alive and reliable: \"*help people confidently fund, operate, and scale programmable treasuries on Ethereum.\"*\n\nWe propose that 2 developers - aeolian + johnnyd - take responsibility for keeping JBM alive moving forward.\n\nResponsibilities are limited to the following:\n\n* Fixes to critical JBM bugs. We define a 'critical bug' as a bug with some or all of the following characteristics:\n    * Site unavailability/outages\n    * Has directly caused (or could cause) loss of funds (project owner or payer)\n    * Inhibits the user performing core Juicebox functionality successfully and accurately (e.g. creating a project, paying a project, redeeming tokens).\n    * Grossly misleads users (e.g. showing incorrect/inaccurate data)\n    * Medium-to-high-severity security vulnerabilities\n* Management of JBM operating expenses, including:\n    * Infura ($200/m, varies by traffic, has been as high as $400/m)\n    * Vercel ($40/m)\n    * Supabase (\\~$40/m)\n    * Fathom ($140/yr)\n    * Namecheap ($60/yr)\n    * Heroku (\\~$20/m)\n    * Postmark ($25/m, currently on free tier)\n    * TOTAL => \\~$342/m => \\~$175/cycle\n* Communicating with DAO members and users specifically regarding bugs, potential bugs, or security vulnerabilities.\n\nNote that there is **no specific feature work** being proposed here. Any future feature development will be proposed to JBDAO with scoped budgets.\n\n## Specification\n\n* US$6,175 per cycle for 20 cycles to [JB Project#609 ](https://juicebox.money/v2/p/609)\n* 5,000,000 (5 million) $JBX to aeolian.eth\n* 5,000,000 (5 million) $JBX to johnnyd.eth\n\n## Rationale\n\n* JBM should be kept alive for as long as possible, to be ready and available for future project creators.\n* Aeolian and JohnnyD are highly knowledgeable and efficient in the JBM codebase, and have a proven track record of timely bug fixes. They are competent across the entire JBM feature set.\n* Have JBM’s frontend devs focus purely on reliability, as opposed to new features. Let the JB protocol and JBM do its thing, reliably.\n* **Budget:** $3,000 per cycle to each johnnyd and aeolian, + \\~$175 per cycle for operating expenses.\n* Reduce JBDAO’s JBM expenditure.\n\n## Risks\n\n* The responsibilities outlined above fail to be met over the next 20 cycles.\n* JBM will become less relevant over time without strategic product investment.\n\n## Timeline\n\nThis proposal should take effect immediately. It should be active for 20 cycles.\n\n## Proposed Actions\n\n\n1. *Juicebox Payout* [Juicebox Project 609](https://juicebox.money/v2/p/609) $6,175 for 20 cycles\n2. *Transfer* 5000000 [0x4554CC10898f92D45378b98D6D6c2dD54c687Fb2](https://etherscan.io/address/0x4554CC10898f92D45378b98D6D6c2dD54c687Fb2) to [aeolian.eth](https://etherscan.io/address/0xE16a238d207B9ac8B419C7A866b0De013c73357B)\n3. *Transfer* 5000000 [0x4554CC10898f92D45378b98D6D6c2dD54c687Fb2](https://etherscan.io/address/0x4554CC10898f92D45378b98D6D6c2dD54c687Fb2) to [johnnyd.eth](https://etherscan.io/address/0xf0FE43a75Ff248FD2E75D33fa1ebde71c6d1abAd)\n\n*actions appended to proposal body by [Nance](https://nance.app/s/juicebox)*",

      "content": "\n## Specification\n\nWithin each 30-day period, allow the multisig to reimburse up to 0.3 ETH for transactions which send JuiceboxDAO's payouts or reserved JBX.\n\nThese amounts are to be paid out at the multisig's discretion, and are not guaranteed to people who send payouts/tokens. Multisig signers should exercise their best judgement when signing or executing reimbursement transactions. For any larger reimbursements, a proposal will still be required.\n\n## Motivation\n\n[JBP-354 - Authorize Gas Reimbursements for 180 Days](https://www.jbdao.org/s/juicebox/354) expired on September 13th, 2023. Since then, the multisig has not been able to reimburse gas fees associated with sending payouts/reserved tokens from JuiceboxDAO's project.\n\nGas fees can become expensive, but writing individual reimbursement proposals takes time and attention. By putting a reasonable reimbursement process in place, the DAO can make operations smoother.\n\n## Risks\n\nThis proposal gives power and responsibility to the multisig, which can go wrong.\n\n## Timeline\n\nApprove these reimbursements for 180 days from the time this proposal is approved on Snapshot.",

      "title": "JBP-461 - Reduce and Renew Wagmi Studio (Sage)  Payout",
      "content": "## **Synopsis**\n\nReduce and renew payout of $3,800 per FC for 10 cycles to Sage for continuation of on demand illustrations and artwork for Juicebox and a one time payout of 10 million JBX\n\n## **Motivation**\n\n**What problem does this solve? Why now?**\n\nThe art and illustrations continue to be an important part of the Juicebox identity and we should continue to use the visuals for promotion and visibility purposes. My illustrations are on almost every visual thing posted about Juicebox, the newsletter, twitter posts, the website. I hope to continue to spread Banny and friends across the crypto community and beyond. I believe (maybe i’m biased) but the art/illustrations/character design brings people in, and makes people interested and curious about the protocol. I plan to continue collaborating with Peel, the visibility team and other members of the JB community to make art for JB, Juicecrowd and other promotional material.\n\nJBX have potential to be a great and popular coin especially with Banny and frens backing it and helping bring attention to JB through the art. Would love to host brainstorm sessions at the end of Town Halls or every other town hall to continue to explore how to spread Banny.\n\nI hope to dive deep in with the other JB members on how to think big and expand the Banny brand. We have a good character that has Pepe potential. We just need to figure out how to harness it.\n\n**Specification**\n**How exactly will this be executed? Be specific and leave no ambiguity.**\n\n• Continue to add new illustrations/gifs to the tenor/giffy keyboard (Every download Giphy Sticker Extension on phone!)\n• Continue to make illustrations that will be used by the visibility team /discord / twitter \n• Continue to work with Peel creating illustrations.\n• Connect with other orgs and work on collaborations and get Banny/Juicebox out into the world (Would love to work with visibility team to brainstorm on who we should reach out to) \n• Produce merch for ETH Denver and have back stock for other conferences that can be shipped to people repping JB \n• Have more NFT drops (that can be potentially redeemable for merch)  and other small projects like releasing a monthly drawing set that can be used for phone backgrounds etc \n• I don’t know anything about stripe and crypto integration but I want to get a merch shop up and running ASAP\n\n## **Rationale**\n\nPeople love Banny and friends and it’s important to continue to spread these characters around the ecosystem! Juicebox is complex and the art/illustrations can aid tremendously in conveying information and adding a visual break for project owners that are trying to understand/grasp the features.\n\nArt isn’t just an afterthought in Juicebox; it’s a fundamental pillar alongside its amazing contracts and front-end. It's the visual identity of Juicebox, and maintaining its appeal is crucial for attracting new followers.\n\n## **Risks**\n\n**What might go wrong?**\n\nI don't create the art/illustrations people want.\n\n## **Timeline**\n\n**When exactly should this proposal take effect? When exactly should this proposal end?**\n\nEffective immediately for the next 10 funding cycles starting GC 64\n\nSample of the work I've created over the past proposal\n\n![samples.png](https://nance.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmcowAHiPo5JeKvZhmpyCszaVvdk32ZQj4WrqZQk1b3hJr)\n\n<br>\n\n\n## Proposed Actions\n\n\n1. *Juicebox Payout* [Juicebox Project 387](https://juicebox.money/v2/p/387) $3,800 for 10 cycles\n\n*actions appended to proposal body by [Nance](https://nance.app/s/juicebox)*",

      "title": "JBP-457 - Renew recurring payout for zhape.eth",
      "content": "## Synopsis\n\nRenew recurring payout and reserved token beneficiary for zhape.eth.\n\n## Motivation\n\nzhape.eth hopes to keep on contributing to JuiceboxDAO, in areas of visibility, community alignment, governance, and etc.\n\n## Specification\n\nPay zhape.eth US$1,500 equivalent of ETH and 500,000 JBX each funding cycle, total 8 FCs, keep his status as a reserved token beneficiary.\n\n## Rationale\n\n### What I have done in the last payout period\n\n1. Town Hall summaries. I have always been thinking that the JuiceboxDAO Town Hall is a very important window to peek into the ongoing development efforts and directions of our community. I have been trying my best to compile the content of this meeting into reports, adding context, history backgroud, images and links, to help other members who are not fully updated to ongoing matters grasp the gist of the topics discussed in these meetings. I use simple languages and re-organize the content if needed so that readers may find easier to understand.\n    During last payout period from August 15th till December 1st, I have made 13 summaries, which can all be found here: [https://docs.juicebox.money/town-hall/](https://docs.juicebox.money/town-hall/)\n2. Chinese version of town hall summaries. With the language barrier, it is not very easy for our Chinese speaking community members to join our conversation, grab information and understand more about Juicebox ecosystem and JuiceboxDAO, so I want to compile also the CN version so that they can get a routine update on what has been going on, and jump into the rabbit hole of Juicebox if they wish. The corresponding town hall cn versions are here: [https://docs.juicebox.money/zh/town-hall/](https://docs.juicebox.money/zh/town-hall/) .\n    Also I have been trying to post CN tweets to briefly introduce the town hall subjects in their respective threads.\n3. Tweets of ongoing governance activities. At the beginning of every governance cycle, I will compile threaded Chinese tweets, on one hand to call out governance engagement, and on the other, to provide abstract information for every proposal, so that members can get the gist of them and thus do their own research easier.\n    And when temp check ends and Snapshot voting begins, I will follow up with a tweet to give updates about discussions and relevant proposal changes.\n    I have been doing this out of the thoughts of lowering the participation barrier for Chinese speaking members, so that hopefully they want to get more involved in our community activities.\n    These tweets can be found in [https://twitter.com/zhape1112](https://twitter.com/zhape1112), and with the help of re-tweeting from our official account [https://twitter.com/juiceboxETH](https://twitter.com/juiceboxETH), hopefully they can reach out to people interested in Juicebox.\n4. Translation on the Juicebox project on Crowdin. I have been trying to keep the Chinese version of our website updated with the changes made.\n5. A mod in the JuiceboxDAO Discord CN channels. I have been sharing updated info of Juicebox ecosystem with our members, as well as answering their questions and etc.\n\n### What I plan to do in the new payout period\n\n1. Work together with Filipv in order to automate the making of town hall summaries and proposal abstracts.\n2. Support Filipv to build a tool to summarize periodic JBDAO Discord activity in Chinese, so as to bring updates in our ecosystem to the Chinese speaking community in a timely manner.\n3. Make Chinese content to introduce more about Juicebox protocol, its mechanism and what it is most suitable for.\n4. Try to make content about our new fronts in Revnet and Bananapus, help users to understand and actively engage with applications like Bananapus, Defifa, Croptop, Juicecrowd, and etc.\n5. Support all the needs of our community members, such as proposal making, internal communication, governance involvement enhancement, and etc. Try to host some sessions to exchange information or opinions with cn community members.\n\n## Risks\n\nI am not responsible for my job, or I fail to deliver what I promised.\n\n## Timeline\n\nIf approved, this proposal will take effect from FC #63, and end after FC#70.\n\n## Proposed Actions\n\n\n1. *Juicebox Payout* [zhape.eth](https://etherscan.io/address/0x5706d5aD7A68bf8692bD341234bE44ca7Bf2f654) $1,500 for 8 cycles\n2. *Transfer* 500000 [0x4554CC10898f92D45378b98D6D6c2dD54c687Fb2](https://etherscan.io/address/0x4554CC10898f92D45378b98D6D6c2dD54c687Fb2) to [zhape.eth](https://etherscan.io/address/0x5706d5aD7A68bf8692bD341234bE44ca7Bf2f654)\n\n*actions appended to proposal body by [Nance](https://nance.app/s/juicebox)*",

We have worked closely with the team on every aspect of the campaign and need to see it through to fruition, including post-campaign and the possibility of deadline extensions. There is significant reputational risk to abandoning the campaign mid-way and our efforts have been essential to its success so far. The next Juicecrowd campaign (JC02) will launch soon after in January 2024 and we are ready to iterate based on learnings from the first edition.\n\n## Recent work\n\n### 🍊 Juicecrowd & collaboration with Peel\n\nM+B have worked closely with Peel to launch Juicecrowd, a new app built on the battle-tested Juicebox contracts that makes it easy to crowdfund onchain.

We will keep pushing this forward and will provide updates.\n\n### 📚 Educational and devrel content\n\nJuicebox can feel complex and hard to understand for new project creators and developers entering the ecosystem. Both of these audiences needs to feel confident in Juicebox in order to create a project or develop an extension, respectively.

The [Hold Fees Error](https://docs.juicebox.money/dev/resources/post-mortem/2023-07-24/) is an example.\n5. **Helping out JuiceboxDAO.** For example: before we disabled fees on v1/v1.1/v2, I distributed payouts from all projects where the fees generated from the distribution would generate more funds for JuiceboxDAO than the gas fee incurred.\n\n## Full List\n\n| Tx Hash                                                            | Amount               | Description                                                  | Value                |\n| ------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------- |\n| 0x8Bc12fEf1f8EFe25fE96fb9B407c46159e82201C                         | 0.00352545           | Deploy revnet multisig                                       | -

The buyback delegate has been working as intended for several cycles.\n\nIn [JBP-447 - Enable Redemptions Again (0% -> 70%)](https://nance.app/s/juicebox/447), I proposed re-enabling redemptions at a 70% rate (as suggested by DAO members). This proposal failed to pass a temperature check, but was generally well-supported. I still think we should turn redemptions back on.\n\n## Specification\n\nUpdate JuiceboxDAO's redemption rate to 70%.\n\n## Rationale\n\nThe redemption rate was 90% before we temporarily disabled it. A 70% redemption rate makes more sense now because:\n\n1. Fee payers now get more JBX because of the buyback delegate. Even at a 70% redemption rate, redeemers will receive more funds now than they did before.\n2. Because of the buyback delegate, ETH from fees will not be routed to JuiceboxDAO's project. We should be slightly more conservative with the ETH made available for redemptions, and encourage DAO members to hold their JBX for longer.\n",

      "content": "Pay filipv $4,000 (after fees) per cycle for 10 cycles, and send him 10m JBX from the multisig.\n\n## Why\n\nI (filipv) have consistently delivered valuable work for JuiceboxDAO. This proposal would reduce my payout to account for the possibility of JuiceboxDAO paying me indirectly through other proposals and treasuries.\n\nWork done for Bananapus, Revnet, and [Emergency Developers](https://nance.app/s/juicebox/450) objectives could be compensated separately and should not be considered when assessing this payout.\n\n## Planned Work\n\nI will continue doing what I think would be the most meaningful to further the objectives laid out in the [JuiceboxDAO Foundation](https://docs.juicebox.money/dao/foundation/), one thing at a time, until I run out of things to do. This is likely to change, but right now this will likely be:\n\n1. Finish language updates to [v4 contracts](https://github.com/Bananapus/juice-contracts-v4/pull/37). I am in the process of updating almost every variable name and comment in the protocol contracts. You can see the [proposed changes here](https://github.com/filipviz/juicebox-v4-naming/blob/master/v4.pdf), and reviews in recent town halls. Once this is done, I plan on going through a similar process to update the NFT delegate and Bananapus contracts.\n2. Once the Bananapus contracts have been finalized, I plan to create a new frontend for them. The [beta version](https://github.com/Bananapus/beta-frontend) was functional, but the contracts and the way we want to interact with them have changed enough to require a new frontend, incorporating learnings from the first one.\n3. Once v4 is wrapped up, I'll probably document it. I'll probably rewrite a good portion of the [Juicebox Docs](https://docs.juicebox.money/).\n4. Many things I'm sure will come up with Revnets.\n\nI also want to make:\n\n- A system which uses AI to summarize Discord server activity to improve transparency into Juicebox ecosystem projects.\n- AI tools to make Juicebox easier to understand for new project creators (new versions of [`bannygpt`](https://github.com/filipviz/bannygpt-v0) and other tools like it).\n\nI also plan to build several tools as part of the [Emergency Developers Project](https://nance.app/s/juicebox/450):\n\n- Alerting for rapid balance changes in any terminals.\n- Alerting for rapid movements in price feeds.\n- Alerts for changes in Juicebox contract ownership.\n- Periodic fork/simulation testing of key functions (maybe pay, redeem, create project) for projects at random.\n- (Maybe) watch new blocks for \"suspicious\" interactions with Juicebox contracts (such as repeated internal transactions, unusual gas usage, lots of reverts).\n\nTo be clear, some of this work might be compensated separately. None of it has been so far, except for a one-time $5,000 payout from Bananapus for creating the beta frontend.\n\n## Recent work\n\nSince my previous payout proposal, I've:\n\n1. Made new independent projects, and maintained and provisioned existing ones.\n\n- Created several tools to speed up other work, like [`human-readable-abis`](https://github.com/filipviz/human-readable-abis), which helps me while working with contracts and on frontends, and [`local-transact`](https://github.com/filipviz/local-transact), which has helped out in situations where a frontend wasn't available to execute a transaction (this helped address the [Artizen issue](https://snapshot.org/#/jbdao.eth/proposal/0x309216a7a0de3672ad37e6ce1300807fd5a4bda11c67f0155575ed17ba86853a), for example).\n- Created tools to keep DAO members up to date. [`fwd-discord-threads`](https://github.com/filipviz/fwd-discord-threads) forwards Discord threads from one channel to another\n- Maintained and updated [`juicebox-heartbeat`](https://github.com/filipviz/juicebox-heartbeat) as project metadata has changed. This powers the `#💓｜heartbeat` and `🤖-juice-notifications` channels in JuiceboxDAO and Peel's Discord servers.\n- Started a [new version](https://github.com/filipviz/juicy-reimburser/blob/master/distributions.js) of [`juicy-reimburser`](https://github.com/filipviz/juicy-reimburser) which reads directly from an RPC instead of the subgraph. I've been using this to manage multisig reimbursements.\n- Maintained [`juicebox-tweeter`](https://github.com/filipviz/juicebox-tweeter), a Twitter feed which sends updates when new Juicebox projects are made. This is not currently in use.\n\nPrevious projects have continued to pay off – the town hall summaries I generate with [`greg`](https://github.com/filipviz/greg), for example, are well-received.\n\n2. Fixing bugs and making improvements to juicebox.money and other projects throughout the ecosystem.\n\n- I made [sim.revnet.app](https://sim.revnet.app/), an interactive Revnet simulator to help project creators envision how a Revnet could work for their project. I also wrote [this Revnet explainer](https://sim.revnet.app/about.html) to introduce people to the concept.\n- I've fixed a number of bugs on juicebox.money. You can see these on [GitHub](https://github.com/jbx-protocol/juice-interface/commits?author=filipviz) and in the `#🐞｜bugs` channel in JuiceboxDAO's Discord server.\n- Added a legal notice/disclaimer shown to users before they connect their wallets to juicebox.money. The content was drafted by me and reviewed by Robert Leonhard from [Open Esquire](https://openesq.tech/). I've paid Rob out-of-pocket to review various JuiceboxDAO-related documents.\n- Various changes to help project creators work with Juicebox (like [this PR in Pinnable](https://github.com/PinnableXYZ/Pinnable/pull/9)) .\n- I made [this yellow paper](https://github.com/rev-net/whitepaper/blob/master/whitepaper/revnet.pdf) to introduce people to Revnets.\n- I wrote the `README` files for all of the Bananapus contracts. I plan to document them once they have been completed.\n- I maintain and improve [docs.juicebox.money](https://docs.juicebox.money/) from time to time. You can see my contributions on [GitHub](https://github.com/jbx-protocol/juice-docs/commits?author=filipviz).\n\n3. Onboarding and helping project creators. Over the past 7 cycles, I've spent a great deal of time working with project creators on a variety of projects.\n\n- I've worked with Rene throughout the process of establishing the Juicebox Project Accelerator Match Fund and the [Artizen](https://juicebox.money/@artizenfund) Juicebox project. This has already been well worth the time, and I expect this partnership to pay off strongly in the long run. TJL has also helped throughout this process.\n- I've been speaking and working with projects in the Accelerator Fund. This is a good deal of work, but has led to the creation of several projects already (and more soon). There are 78 projects in this cohort, which means a lot of time emailing, calling, and explaining.\n- I've worked with various contributors to a project interested in funding the legal defense of Roman Storm through Juicebox. Although the project hasn't launched just yet, they are actively developing specialized features they'll need. I expect this to be fruitful. Matthew, Brileigh, and TJL have also helped throughout this process.\n- I helped projects like [$Pepe sponsors Hibernian FC](https://juicebox.money/v2/p/546), [Legends](https://juicebox.money/v2/p/548), and [Dream DAO](https://juicebox.money/v2/p/581) over Discord and Twitter once their projects had already been created.\n- I've spoken with many other project creators and community members along the way – I try to help out as many people as I can. You can see this in the `#❓｜support` and `#🚀｜project-creators` channels of the JuiceboxDAO Discord server.\n\nSome projects did not work out though:\n\n- Bobo's Big Top DAO. I spent a lot of time helping this project, which failed to garner any support. Lesson learned.\n- The Will4US campaign, which was interested in funding a political campaign on Juicebox. This didn't pan out – the project was looking for a larger commitment of customized development which JuiceboxDAO and Peel weren't able to provide.\n- KennedyDAO, a project to partially fund Robert Kennedy Jr.'s presidential run on Juicebox (not directly associated with the Kennedy campaign). This project didn't have enough contributors willing and able to get it off the ground.\n\nThese cycles have seen mixed success. Part of this is up to chance, but I've also learned from the experience and will try to work with better projects moving forwards.\n\n4. Operations.\n\n- I queue, coordinate, and execute most multisig transactions.\n- I'm heavily involved with JuiceboxDAO governance. I wrote 16 out of the 33 proposals in the previous 7 cycles (48% of them) – of note were:\n  - [JBP-419: Reduce Multisig to 6/9](https://www.jbdao.org/s/juicebox/419): After several close calls, I proposed reducing the size of the multisig to ensure governance outcomes could be signed and executed on time.\n  - [JBP-434: Governance Process – Amendment 10](https://www.jbdao.org/s/juicebox/434): I drafted and proposed an amendment to the governance process which made it far easier for newcomers to read, and included \"Abstain\"/\"Against\" votes in the Snapshot quorum.\n  - [JBP-437: Fund RevNet Development](https://www.jbdao.org/s/juicebox/437): This proposal provided the initial funding for [RevNet](https://sim.revnet.app/about.html) development.\n  - [JBP-438: Juicebox Project Accelerator Fund](https://www.jbdao.org/s/juicebox/438): Although it took another round of governance to get this proposal approved, this partnership with Artizen has led to 78 projects being brought into JuiceboxDAO's ecosystem. Not all of them have launched projects yet, but many of them are participating in the first Juicecrowd cohort.\n- I manage the DAO's software subscriptions – Figma, Notion, Google, and other things as they come up.\n- I manage and moderate the DAO's Discord server, and help out with Discord servers for project creators and projects within the ecosystem.\n- I'm involved with the implementation of most governance proposals.\n- I regularly clean up roles, permissions, and content across Discord, GitHub, Figma, and other services. This keeps things up-to-date and saves the DAO money.\n\n5. Security. I have been on-hand to respond to and mitigate issues as they've come up. I've also handled comms and post-mortems, some of which you can read here: [1](https://docs.juicebox.money/dev/resources/post-mortem/2023-07-24/) [2](https://docs.juicebox.money/dev/resources/post-mortem/2023-10-26/). You can also see several bug-fixes I've contributed to in the `🐞｜bugs` channel.\n\n6. Miscellaneous. I do many other things which haven't been included in this proposal. I also made a [YouTube guide](https://youtu.be/ZG4RJYvH8TQ?si=NJcgmgflmq65_WdS) for the Juicebox Project Accelerator Fund entrants, contributed code and ideas to various projects (you can see some on [GitHub](https://github.com/filipviz)), and do my best to learn new and relevant things over time. I am now moderately proficient in [Go](https://go.dev/) and I study machine learning every day.\n\n## Proposed Actions\n\n\n1. *Juicebox Payout* [filipv.eth](https://etherscan.io/address/0x30670d81e487c80b9edc54370e6eaf943b6eab39) $4,103 for 10 cycles\n\n*actions appended to proposal body by [Nance](https://nance.app/s/juicebox)*",

      "title": "JBP-450 - Fund Juicebox Protocol Emergency Developers",
      "content": "## Synopsis\n\nPay Dr Gorilla, Ba5ed and Filip to look after the protocol, be on-call for bugs and related emergency communications, maintain communication of technical nuances with precision in documentation as doubts arise, and generally attend towards technical risk mitigation. If all goes well, we won't be needed much during these next 20 cycles, at which point the DAO will have even more confidence that the protocol is self sufficient.\n\nWe'll support our work by building a few simple security workflows:\n\n1. Alerting for rapid balance changes in any terminals.\n2. Periodic fork/simulation testing of key functions (maybe pay, redeem, create project) for projects at random.\n3. Alerting for rapid movements in price feeds.\n4. Maybe we can watch new blocks for \"suspicious\" interactions with JB contracts (repeated internal txs, unusual gas usage, lots of reverts).\n\nThe folks being paid through this proposal will be spending most of their time on Applications and R&D efforts funded outside of this payout, like Bananapus.\n\n## Motivation\n\nThe Juicebox Protocol works. Necessary or suggested changes to it have become scarce, but the risk of unknowns and memories of sleepless nights remind us that insurance is still valuable to recognize as the DAO shift most of its resource allocation to growth.\n\nIn my view there are three paths to growth:\n\n* Don't spend. Let all value accrue to $JBX as it grows on its own.\n* Spend on iterative strategized growth efforts.\n* R&D and artful experimentation that open up new possibilities.\n\nThese are all more important to allocate to right now than protocol development, though making sure we have staff in place to keep things from going to 0 in extreme circumstances should remain a priority.\n\n## Specification\n\n* *$9k / cycle for 20 cycles to Juicebox Protocol Emergency Developers*\n* 15m $JBX upfront to *Juicebox Protocol Emergency Developers (0xd0a12b8279614A46b75Dc23DBB3245094a3f2A49)*\n\n## Rationale\n\n*Much smaller comp (3k per dev / FC) compared to active contract dev expenditures throughout the DAO's lifetime, but longer cycle duration that acknowledges the perpetual nature of this work. After 20 cycles, I'll feel confident that we can reassess.*\n\n## Risks\n\n*3 people will formally monitor the protocol and be on-call to address mishaps. This gives us redundancy and presence around various time zones, but there's risk of uncaught emergencies that aren't mitigated in time before worsening.*\n\n## Timeline\n\n*Next FC.*\n\n## Proposed Actions\n\n\n1. *Juicebox Payout* [Juicebox Project 1](https://juicebox.money/v2/p/1) $9,000 for 20 cycles\n2. *Transfer* 15000000 [0x4554CC10898f92D45378b98D6D6c2dD54c687Fb2](https://etherscan.io/address/0x4554CC10898f92D45378b98D6D6c2dD54c687Fb2) to [0xd0a12b8279614A46b75Dc23DBB3245094a3f2A49](https://etherscan.io/address/0xd0a12b8279614A46b75Dc23DBB3245094a3f2A49)\n\n*actions appended to proposal body by [Nance](https://nance.app/s/juicebox)*",

      "title": "JBP-449 - Reimburse Filip and Jango for fees incurred while resolving Artizen issue",
      "content": "## Background\n\nOn 2023-10-26, an issue with juicebox.money led to the [Artizen project](https://juicebox.money/@artizenfund) being configured incorrectly. To address this, I deployed a new project, set it up to match what Nene (Artizen's founder) intended, and worked with him to point his ENS at the new project (so that the `https://juicebox.money/@artizenfund` URL would point to it instead of the [old project](https://juicebox.money/v2/p/580)).\n\nIn doing this, I paid various gas fees. This proposal would reimburse those gas fees.\n\nTo make the new project's balance equal to the old project's balance, I paid the new project 3.02 ETH and Jango paid the project 3 ETH. I've configured the [old project](https://juicebox.money/v2/p/580) to pay out its 6.02 ETH back to the JuiceboxDAO multisig, and transferred that project to the multisig. These funds will be returned once the current cycle expires on January 31st 2024.\n\nThis proposal would also reimburse jango and I for these amounts. To be clear, the multisig will get this money back on January 31st.\n\n## Specification\n\nReimburse filipv (filipv.eth) a total of 3.310219392586055 ETH.\n\nReimburse jango (jango.eth) a total of 3.001606179028399407 ETH.\n\n## Transactions\n\nI executed the following transactions:\n\n| Tx Hash

      "title": "JBP-446 - Fund JuiceTable (TokenTable) team to co-develop with the RevNet Core Team",
      "content": "## Synopsis\n\n*State what the proposal does in one sentence.*\n\nAllocate a total of $18,000 for JuiceTable (TokenTable) team to co-develop Revnet with Revnet Research Group across three check marks, delivering token unlocker contract and telegram bots tailored to project creators and contributors on Revnet. \n\n## Motivation\n\n*What problem does this solve? Why now?*\n\n**Thesis 1: Integrating JuiceTable Token Unlocker Contract on Revnet**\n\nRevnet introduced an innovative approach to a revenue-sharing network, incentivizing various participants to grow with the network. However, we believe, as JuiceTable originally proposed, that a pay-over-time or vesting feature, can greatly improve the network health and investor confidence. \n\nIn traditional business, different vesting schedules were implemented to incentivize stakeholders, including founders, investors, and employees, to “stay longer” in the business. Therefore, instead of a lump-sum payout in the beginning, stocks are distributed over a period of time to prevent selling pressure from stakeholders, or lack of motivation for founders. Token unlocker smart contract aims to address this issue. \n\nPossible integration leads to the possibility of the following three scenarios:\n\n*   When founders redeem their tokens for eth, partially or entirely, they will receive eth through a certain unlocking schedule.\n*   When investors redeem their tokens for eth, partially or entirely, they will receive eth through a certain unlocking schedule.\n*   When customers redeem their tokens for eth, partially or entirely, they will receive eth through a certain unlocking schedule. \n\nVarious types of participants can have different unlocking schedules due to the difference in their stakes and potential impact it can cause for the entire network.\n\nJuiceTable originated from 2023 BuildGuidl x Juicebox [hackathon](https://snapshot.org/#/filipv.eth/proposal/0xcecf8f9a92cea21c55d7cdde739b1b48101b75b24f8edb945feb0cd7aad7f9c2) with a goal to address the issue of lacking vesting capability for existing Juicebox Protocol. Now, thanks to the great composability and flexibility of Revnet, we would like to make it a reality and allow our customized unlocking schedule to actually benefit the innovative Revnet protocol.  \n\n**Thesis 2: Build a frontend for Revnet on Telegram**\n\n**What is Telegram Bot? **\n\nChatbots on Telegram have become a new trend in crypto trading and adds powerful features onto the already popular messaging app Telegram among crypto communities. Mostly, successful telegram bot offers a super user-friendly alternative to existing decentralized finance (DeFi) applications.\n\nTapping into the 800 million monthly active users on Telegram, in which many of them are regular crypto users, these bots gain tremendous amounts of traction. According to [Binance Research](https://www.binance.com/en/blog/ecosystem/binance-research-exploring-the-landscape-of-crypto-bots-on-telegram-5142846021889281836), user metrics of Telegram bots hit a record high in July, with over 6K unique daily users. Daily trading volume via Telegram bots reached a record high on July 23, 2023, exceeding $10M. Till today, Banana Gun, one of the most used crypto trading bot, is one of the largest [gas guzzlers](https://etherscan.io/gasTracker) on ethereum. \n\n**Telegram Bot for Revnet (and potentially Juicebox)**\n\nWe all love Juicebox Protocol for its openness, its vibe, and most importantly, its battle-tested smart contracts for projects to create and manage crowd-fundraising using crypto. Now, as we are deep into the bear market, we see a downward trend for the usage of Juicebox Protocol. This phenomenon can lead to a decrease in the popularity of Juicebox among different crypto communities, and also a decline in the protocol revenue, mainly from the membership fee when users withdraw funds from their treasury. \n\nHowever, with telegram bots simplifying the onboarding and contributing process, we might be able to change that. \n\n<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Increased Access for Project Creators </span>\\\nJuicebox Protocol can help people raise funds for different purposes. Yet, many of them may not know how to use it. For example, for those who come from less privileged areas, they might have very limited access to desktops and thus it is impossible for them to create a project on Juicebox. Therefore, a mobile-first approach with telegram bot can be very important to bring them onboard to Juicebox Protocol and hopefully help them with their fundraising needs. Thus, a bot can help users easily create a project on their phone using telegram. \n\n<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Better User Experience for Contributors </span>\\\nFor contributors, a bot can help them create or import their wallets to facilitate the process of fund transfer. Also, project creators can easily share their projects to different group chats, channels and everything, helping contributors discover new active projects. With the trading bot feature “auto sniping” new Juicebox projects, we might be able to bring back the old days. \n\n**JuiceTable team**\n\nWe are a team of four currently building the TokenTable protocol. We are already pretty excited about this idea, as proven by the Buildguidl Hackathon earlier this year with our demo on JuiceTable. Now, with the deployment of Revnet, we would like to make this vision come true. \n\nAs to the telegram bot development, we already have extensive experiences making telegram bots. Please refer to our sister product EthSign to see how you can view and sign documents using telegram bots. Feel free to try on ethsign.xyz and link your telegram handle with your wallet or check out a demo video here. \n\nThe team consists of the following four of us:\n\nClaire: Product and Design Queen\\\nJack: Smart Contract Magician\\\nJordan: Frontend Wizard\\\nLJ: Project Manager\n\n## Specification\n\n*How exactly will this be executed? Be specific and leave no ambiguity.*\n\nFor telegram bot, we will start with developing a telegram bot for the Revnet. Once we get more familiar with the settings, we will develop a generic one for Juicebox Protocol. \n\nFor the JuiceTable unlocker contract, we will work with the Revnet team to integrate with the existing contract design. Once we get more familiar with the settings, we will deploy the smart contract to L2s.\n\nOur development team can assist with other development needs when the Revnet team sees fit. \n\n## Rationale\n\n*Why is this specification appropriate?*\n\nThis specification is appropriate because we have done extensive research on these topics and already communicated with the Revnet team.\n\n## Risks\n\n*What might go wrong?*\n\nWe are pretty confident with the expected delivery. The risks might be a delay of delivery due to holidays. The payout is event-triggered so if there is a delay in delivery, there can be a delay of payout. \n\n## Timeline\n\n*When exactly should this proposal take effect? When exactly should this proposal end?*\n\n**Payout #1 - Sprint 1 Detailed Planning (2 weeks)**\n\nWeekly check-in with Revnet team\n\n**Deliverables: **\n\n*   **Telegram Bots**\\\n    Figma Wireframes \\\n    Product documentations\n*   **Unlocker Contract**\\\n    Requirement document \n\n**Payout #2 - Sprint 2 Product Development (2-3 weeks)**\n\nWeekly check-ins with Revnet team\n\n**Deliverables:**\n\n*   Telegram Bot development\n*   Unlocker Contract Integration with Revnet\n\n**Payout #3 - Sprint 3 Testing and Deployment (2 weeks)**\n\nWeekly check-ins with Revnet team\n\n**Deliverables:**\n\n*   Telegram Bot active for Revnet\n*   Unlocker active for Revnet\n*   Product docs, marketing material published\n*   Presentation on Juicebox TownHall Meeting\n\n\n## Proposed Actions\n\n\n1. *Juicebox Payout* [0x162FbD38FC295Fd71443B2F35eF507D403508e3a](https://etherscan.io/address/0x162FbD38FC295Fd71443B2F35eF507D403508e3a) $6,000 for 1 cycle\n2. *Juicebox Payout* [0x162FbD38FC295Fd71443B2F35eF507D403508e3a](https://etherscan.io/address/0x162FbD38FC295Fd71443B2F35eF507D403508e3a) $6,000 for 1 cycle\n3. *Juicebox Payout* [0x162FbD38FC295Fd71443B2F35eF507D403508e3a](https://etherscan.io/address/0x162FbD38FC295Fd71443B2F35eF507D403508e3a) $6,000 for 1 cycle\n\n*actions appended to proposal body by [Nance](https://nance.app/s/juicebox)*",

      "title": "JBP-442 - Renew & (smol) Increase Payout for Nance Project",
      "content": "## Synopsis\n\nRenew and increase funding to the nance Juicebox project for $12,000 per funding cycle for 7 cycles **(total $84,000)**\n\n## Motivation\n\n**TL;DR**\n\nNance is a powerful tool that eases governance processes and lowers the administrative overhead of managing a Juicebox project. With this payout renewal, we plan to bring new communities into the Juicebox ecosystem. We will focus on partnerships and business development (BD) as well as building features that allow communities to progressively move from a simple Snapshot+Discord system to governance with cycles, Safe, Juicebox and, finally, on-chain governance. We will focus that effort in ecosystems where Juicebox and Nance are still not present to maximize the growth.\n\n### Team update\n\nNicholas parted ways from Nance in July to pursue other projects. In order to help fulfill his role (and more) Zeugh has joined the team.\n\nZeugh has already hit the ground running in his mixed role of project management, business development, and design.\n\n### What got built?\n\nHere are some updates on what gone done since our last proposal, [JBP-405](/s/juicebox/405)\n\n**Business Development and Growth:**\n\n1.  **Start of BD Mapping Effort** - We have mapped different types of users, needs and approaches to be applied with the goal of bringing Nance as a solution to their governance. The focus so far has been understanding the best type of clients to pursue, aiming at the best ratio between new features needed and new visibility in ecosystem we are not present.\\\n    **![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/2wIbOF641oQRC9VxpwzclKC1obU6-JltSVuWh0JjEegZVnF4PqKUuUrytsCl-YPDR_DSPMRYWz-8GVPJUEQjCYbwYgymueUGbzo-fI4FevUh4AqH9vM-71O35VhksK1FSms2fRAWR887x9jfStc1d5g)![](https://nance.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmQAUwq3k2zEKG6ztkhqb88XShDg5UzHuWPdQC5StBSyUe)**\n2.  **New client acquisition** - [AgroforestDAO](https://agroforestdao.web.app/) and [Africa DeFi Alliance](https://africadefialliance.org/) are two new clients that came from our first effort in growth. Both have Nance defined as their governance integration system, and plan to launch Juicebox projects in the future. For now, they are operating with more basic systems, and will have different uses for Juicebox and Nance as they evolve. Both projects are in ecosystems where Juicebox has a small presence thus we will make good use cases to spread Juicebox to these new areas via Nance.\\\n    \\\n    *AgroforestDAO Goerli Project*\\\n    ![](https://nance.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmYxnCokJ7YJEsYR5qVCgAUSGM4FGCZE2zC5LTMehANVPJ)\\\n    ![](https://nance.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmbgtoWwbnBCcgCCJC4WbUbk8bCFJhtBfWP6U4Vr1uuvR5)\n3.  **System Architecture mapping for Tutorials** - We created a first analysis of the Nance system, which will be used to make simple tutorials on the new website. This mapping came from the onboarding of the new users described above. It will be used to continue our growth and breakdown what Nance does so we can clearly explain to new DAOs how we can help them manage their governance process.\\\n    **![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/6bcH7IB6eNurcer4xJoB0DMyBAC54utTifrudwXmRKBtQsM-cU2EbtAFxqJs5anbqlijuvFgt3uSZZOSWKaSEd_D3Ll8A_OpcfLvAhs88AF9nSgMzUch3xVy7Y4SD8v7t2KLqWtnS_4FP6uOF2ule7A)**\n4.  **Partnership reachouts** - We've established connections with Snapshot, Aragon, Excelsior Labs, TheDAOist, RnDAO and Collab.land DAO, presenting our product, understanding their systems and mapping for future possible partnerships. This work is in different stages with different partners.  \n\n**Product Development and Improvements:**\n\n1.  **Multicall proposal queuing system** - This feature gathers all of the payout and transfer requests from the most recent governance cycle, displays them in a clean easy to review manner, and allows multisig members to queue transactions. Also has built in Tenderly simulation before queuing.\\\n    \\\n    *Reconfigure juicebox project, only showing changed payouts (also capable of showing all payouts and project metadata)*\\\n    ![](https://nance.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmNr3d1uvvC4h3Ggakf7WASZsUyM1ehbcgcCsH2EUjciEe) \\\n    \\\n    ![](https://nance.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmaGjoUaAj57D3A8TgEuyCSPgP4Hc5W6hwWyDL8RZtXiLF)\n2.  **Create space UI** - The create space UI allows for other DAOs to create their own space at [https://nance.app/create](/create). It has Discord, Snapshot, Juicebox project search, and Safe App integration to allow for a user to easily configure everything they need for Nance to run their governance. Recently, jacopo was utilized this page to setup a governance process for <https://slice.so> ([Discord](https://discord.gg/cKRZgJYnqU), [Nance space](/s/Slice)).\\\n    \\\n    ![](https://nance.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmcKi9Aot79EZTiyctg6bmpXg98cs2t5gXgDw7HYbjqE2Y)\n3.  **Homepage and contact form** - The new homepage launched a few weeks ago and helps explain what Nance does and who is using it. Check it out at [https://nance.app](). We also have a contact form that will post to Discord to help with the acquisition of new Nance users.\\\n    ![](https://nance.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmbqYZdgnCCkEKWJUsDpFNKdJqjQm2gw47Xegp4jcLPoEv)\\\n    \\\n    ![](https://nance.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmQDLd3zUSKcHVNkfcY5rkcnw9vzLMPra64wbGYF4oAcao)\n4.  **User interface guide** - This helps new users gain insight into how to use nance as proposal viewer and proposal writer. Built with [driver.js](https://driverjs.com).\\\n    ![](https://nance.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmZt4aghbe9mopoks4ibodH7swqJLzGoBrUwe4tLWzTH5o)\n5.  **Auto generate Table of Contents for proposals** - helpful for navigating long proposals\\\n    ![](https://nance.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmZQGKHVzpHktPC3DAH49HmWwPD6NnXT55go5dHnUq2WsZ)\n6.  **View multiple governance cycles** - You can now view proposals from multiple governance cycles at a time\\\n    ![](https://nance.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmTwNhrz5YENSrZvHTNfAvWMrzT1owtdLkEHwd2SA6qnAK)\n7.  **More filter vote options -** Filter Snapshot vote viewing by For or Against (feature requested by aeolian)\n8.  **Improved search** - The proposal search abilities improved by adding a better mySQL relevance calculation\n9.  **Speed optimizations** - We were able to greatly improve the speed of nance.app by adding proper data caching on both the frontend and backend as well as removing bulky API calls.\n10. **Database migration to hosted Dolt** - The Nance dolt database is now hosted on <https://hosted.doltdb.com> for $50/month. This is a much more robust and reliable system than the self hosted dolt instance we were using before.\n11. **Nance.app is Safe App compatible** - (feature request by jango)\n\n### What are we planning on doing?\n\n**Business Development:**\n\n1.  **Governance Podcast** - Nothing makes DAO nerds look at you as much as sh\\*tting in their face by showing their governance actually sucks and they are suffering for no reason. We will make a Twitter podcast hosted every 2 weeks by Zeugh, talking to DAO builders and members to understand different governance mechanics in DAOs, map their pros and cons and study how to improve them. Zeugh has already hosted web3 podcasts in the past and got some nice traction with FounderTalk and BRweb3. We will make the summaries of those calls into a database of analysis so we can visualize the different setup possibilities. The goal is to work with different communities so we can position Nance and the Juicebox Ecosystem closer to others working with systems that could benefit from using our tools. \n\n2.  **Initialize RevNet token burning** **model** - We would like to work closely with the RevNet/Retailism team in order to land on a solid token burning model for Nance usage. Need more details on RevNet operating model but excited to explore this world. A part of our vision so far is making sure that projects partnering with JBDAO can run for free on the tokens JBDAO has for supporting Nance development so far, and bringing value back in that treasury with a system of tokens bought/staked/burned (or similar) as needed for usage of the system.\n\n3.  **Nance Demos and Office Hours** - Zeugh will be available at Nance Discord/Nance Twitter/JB Discord in different times of the week for support with Nance and governance in general. He will also be hosting demo sessions for new space creators and answering async questions about Nance to have a fast feedback loop on first new clients.\n\n4.  **Onboarding Docs** - Creating the \"How it Works\" session of nance.app, explaining the system in both a simple and technical version. This is a continuation of the effort described in \\*\\*Business Development and Growth \\*\\*point 2.\n\n5.  **DAOs reachout (3 Waves)**- We will create new touchpoints with 90 new DAOs in the next 3 months, divided in 3 waves.\n\n    1.  Personal reach out:\n\n        10 DAOs over 2 weeks, reaching out to founders and builders in our network that can benefit from nance and help us understand what pains we can help solve outside a JBDAO model. \n\n    2.  Good match reach out:\n\n        20 DAOs that we consider a good fit, over 4 weeks, reaching out through Zeugh bizdev network to DAOs that we consider good matches for our service, with the goal of building them a Nance Space and improving their governance by Snapshot <> Discord integration at first moment\n\n    3.  Easy-fit cold out reach:\n\n        60 DAOs, 6 weeks, reaching out to DAOs we have no connection with through discord and twitter, offering them the self onboard to integrate Snapshot and Disc through Nance by themselves and making ourselves available for support if needed. Goal here is to try product market fit independently from our influence.\n\n6.  **Integration Partnerships** - We are on the move to integrate Jokerace to our system, and we will actively pursue partnerships and integrations with more systems that can benefit from the seamless flow of Nance and/or the governance cycle structure. The goal is to bring users of other products to the network and let the magic of Juicebox, Nance and Revnets show them that they found the right place. First goal is Jokerace, followed by Aragon and Collab.land.\n\n**Product Development and Improvement:**\n\n1.  **Launch a Juicebox Project** **action** - A Nance action to create a Juicebox project will help bring new DAOs into the Juicebox ecosystem by providing a simple template for them to launch their own Juicebox project. We will have a short list of templates for users that want a Juicebox project but do not want to think about all of the intricacies of reserve rate, reduction rate, or redemption rate. These are things that a more advance user can opt into later if they please. A basic project with a 14 day funding cycle, basic token rules, a 3 day reconfiguration delay, and promote the concept of having more than 1 payout on the project.\n2.  **Launch a Jokerace action** - Jokerace is a very popular platform created by [David Phelps](https://twitter.com/divine_economy) and [Sean McCaffery](https://twitter.com/seanmc_eth) and partial funded by Juicebox from [JBP-211](/s/juicebox/211). They have a new system that allows contest creates to attach rewards that are distributed to the top submissions. We plan to create a Nance action that launches a Jokerace with the reward of a Juicebox project (launched by the efforts from point 1). This will be another great way to spread Juicebox to those outside of the ecosystem.\n3.  **Link Discord for tagged alerts** - When submitting a proposal, user's will be able to link their Discord and opt in to tagged alerts for expiring payout proposals.\n4.  **Edit space** - Currently no way to edit a space setting in the UI, this is one of the first thing users need help with after creating a space. This is essential for onboarding new users in a seamless fashion.\n5.  **Edit Juicebox Project Settings** - This will allow for a Nance space to submit a proposal that edits the settings of their Juicebox project (to support all features under Advanced tab on <https://juicebox.money> settings page) \n6.  **Continue performance improvements** - We plan to continue our efforts of speed optimizations and bug squashing on the frontend and backend. This is another essential component of making a good experience for new Nance users. Without it new users may deem the app too slow and look for alternatives.\n\n## Specification\n\n*Note: The [nance juicebox project](https://juicebox.money/v2/p/477) is owned by a 2/3 multisig with jigglyjams, twodam, and zeugh as the signers.*\n\nThe main use of the funds will be to pay our contributors:\n\n1.  jigglyjams - $4,500/cycle\n2.  twodam - $5,000/cycle\n3.  zeugh - $2,500/cycle\\\n    \\===================\\\n    **TOTAL request $12,000/cycle**\n\n## Risks\n\nThe nance team may fail to do this job properly\n\n**Mitigations:**\n\n*   The Nance team of zeugh, twodam, and jigglyjams have been meeting regularly (Nancehall is every week alternating between 1AM and 1PM UTC, [see nance discord for details](https://discord.gg/eHv5kwbgGE)) to further speed up the development process of the platform\n*   Zeugh's experience in the DAO space over the last year gives us a really good position to get Nance in the hands of many DAOs\n*   Twodam is always working on new features and optimizations of the frontend\n*   Jigglyjam is always thinking about more scalable bot solutions, improving Discord alerts, and optimizing manual administrative processes\n\n## Timeline\n\nThis proposal shall take effect in GC#59\n",

      "content": "## Synopsis\n\nJuicebox projects will be able to offer cross-chain incentives by end of November, with multi-cycle queuing, staking rewards, and a few more accounting/integration benefits alongside.\n\nThe Bananapus end game spec is now clear: It will deploy a slightly updated version of the Juicebox protocol onto ETH mainnet and Optimism, and collect 2.5% protocol fees into its $NANA revnet (<https://revnet.eth.limo>) operated by the $JBX multisig. It will include its flagship staking mechanism called Tentacles that facilitate cross-chain financial alignment between networks and organizations.\n\nThe remaining todo's and the necessary budget to staff us through the finish line safely are also clear. This proposal is for a $120,000 grant to pay for NANA testing and audit contests, and an invitation to the Juicebox community to support its go-to-market moment.\n\n## Motivation\n\nFor updates and quick links, keep up with [https://bananapus.eth.limo.](https://bananapus.eth.limo)\n\n### Technical todo list:\n\n#### **Finish Juicebox V3 fork**\n\nTLDR: The fork will allow for multi-cycle queuing, multi-currency accounting within a cycle, bring-your-own price feed, and a handful of other accounting and integration optimizations.\n\nNeed: The following PRs need to be tested and thoroughly reviewed: <https://github.com/Bananapus/juice-contracts-v4/pulls>.\n\nStaff: Lead by nowonder and Jango, supported by nowonder and DrGorilla.\n\nBudget: $40k, managed by Jango.\n\n#### **Finish staking mechanism**\n\nTLDR: Staking allows the distribution of rewards between networks and organizations across chains.\n\nNeed: The following repos aren't yet tested in production and need to be reviewed by external developers after internal touchups:\n\n*   Staking: <https://github.com/Bananapus/bananapus-721-staking-delegate> - Create a staked position\n*   Periodic reward claiming: <https://github.com/Bananapus/bananapus-distributor> - Distribution rewards to stakers of particular tokens who check in on a periodic basis.\n*   Tentacles: <https://github.com/Bananapus/bananapus-tentacles> - Claim rewards across chains.\n\nStaff: Lead by 0xBa5ed and Jango, supported by nowonder and DrGorilla.\n\nBudget: $40k, managed by Jango.\n\n#### **Finish baseline Bananapus.com**\n\nTLDR: bananapus.com is the webclient that give access to the Bananapus staking mechanism for rewards and tentacle management.\n\nNeed: Shore up the reliability and user experience of the site. The repo is at <https://github.com/Bananapus/bananapus.com>\n\nStaff: Lead by filip, needs help.\n\nBudget: $20k, managed by filip.\n\n### Organizational todo list:\n\n*Misc organizational overhead has the remaining budget of $20k, managed by Jango.*\n\n#### Finalize revnet specs\n\n\\*For an intro to revnets, see <https://revnet.eth.limo/about/> \\*\\\n\\\nThe $NANA revnet on Ethereum mainnet will have the following specifications. These are subject to change and need finalization:\n\n|                         |                                                                                                                      |\n| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| **Property**            | **Value**                                                                                                            |\n| Initial issuance        | 1,000 $NANA / ETH                                                                                                    |\n| Issuance reduction rate | 2.5% every 28 days                                                                                                   |\n| Premint                 | 37,000,000 $NANA to dao.jbx.eth ($JBX currently has a \\~37,000 ratio between its issuance rate and its total supply) |\n| Boost                   | 30% operated by dao.jbx.eth for 3 years.                                                                             |\n| Exit tax curve          | 10%                                                                                                                  |\n\nThe $opNANA revnet on Optimism will have the following specifications:\n\n|                         |                                                                                                                                                         |\n| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| **Property**            | **Value**                                                                                                                                               |\n| Initial issuance        | 1,000 $opNANA / ETH                                                                                                                                     |\n| Issuance reduction rate | 2.5% every 28 days                                                                                                                                      |\n| Premint                 | 37,000,000 $opNANA to dao.jbx.eth ($JBX currently has a \\~37,000 ratio between its issuance rate and its total supply)                                  |\n| Boost                   | 30% operated by dao.jbx.eth for 3 years, initially set at 20% to $opNANA stakers, and 10% to $NANA:OP (mainnet staked $NANA on Optimism via a tentacle) |\n| Exit tax curve          | 10%                                                                                                                                                     |\n\n## Specification\n\n*$120k grant to NANA JB project.*\n\n \n\n## Risks\n\n*NANA technical components will only go live when everyone feels very good about it.

The buyback delegate has permission to mint JBX, meaning any errors or edge cases could lead to runaway minting and redemption of some or all of the funds from JuiceboxDAO's project. To prevent any potential loss of funds, we should temporarily disable redemptions.\n\n## Specification\n\nSet the redemption rate to 0% in the upcoming cycle.\n\n## Risks\n\nThis proposal doesn't include a timeline for re-enabling redemptions, leaving it to a future proposal instead.\n",

      "title": "JBP-436 - Update Reserved Allocation (September 2023)",
      "content": "## Synopsis\n\nUpdate the reserved list to include active JuiceboxDAO contributors. For organizations that work with JuiceboxDAO, send reserved tokens to their multisigs instead of individuals.\n\n## Motivation\n\n1.  Sending reserved JBX to multisigs instead of individuals allows those organizations to use their JBX more creatively – to distribute as an added incentive, to build a stockpile, to vote collectively, or to do something else.\n2.  Allocating reserved issuance to align incentives with active contributors will become even more important as the buyback delegate is implemented, which may significantly increase reserved issuance.\n3.  Simplifying this list makes it easier to verify relevant multisig transactions.\n\n## Risks\n\nSending JBX to multisigs gives these organizations more to manage, even if minor. This distribution is only a loose approximation.\n\n## Specification\n\nUpdate reserved JBX distributions like so:\n\n| Recipient           | Percentage |\n| ------------------- | ---------- |\n| dao.jbx.eth         | 32%        |\n| Peel (6)            | 24%        |\n| Nance (2.5)         | 10%        |\n| Juicecast (2)       | 8%         |\n| WAGMI Studios (1.5) | 6%         |\n| drgorilla.eth       | 4%         |\n| filipv.eth          | 4%         |\n| breadfruit.eth      | 4%         |\n| jb.0xba5ed.eth      | 4%         |\n| zhape.eth           | 4%         |\n\n## Rationale\n\nSince there are now fewer recipients, I've slightly increased the allocation to dao.jbx.eth (from 30% -> 32%).\n\nThe list was updated to only include current contributors, with 4% per individual. Organization allocations were calculated based on the following list:\n\n| Org           | Members                                        |\n| ------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |\n| Peel          | 6: TJL, peri, aeolian, Strath, wraeth, johnnyd |\n| Nance         | 2.5: jigglyjams, twodam, Zeugh (part-time)     |\n| Juicecast     | 2: matthewbrooks, brileigh                     |\n| WAGMI Studios | 1.5: Sage, mieos (part-time)                   |\n\n## Timeline\n\nImplement in the cycle following this proposal's approval.\n",

These include:\n\n*   Redesign, build, and deployment of the new project page.\n\n*   Redesign, build, and deployment of new project settings, including an overhaul of project configuration.\n\n*   Addition of new project creator tools/features such as:\n\n    *   Rich text editor (usage seen in the last several projects), and\n    *   Project updates (usage seen in several projects inc. <https://twitter.com/juanlarrazabal/status/1691117660699000834>).\n\n*   Redesign of the create flow inc. thoughtful education contributions such as:\n\n    *   Improved flow and layout,\n    *   Educational side panel,\n    *   Draft/save project, and\n    *   Preview project.\n\n*   Addition of an automated bug bot for Linear tracking and management.\n\n*   Considerable growth exploration efforts including [Gamewallet](https://www.gamewallet.gg/) (delayed), [ETHGlobal](https://www.notion.so/Peel-Renewal-Proposal-September-23-2eb418b4bf17417db9cdeef5e0111369?pvs=21) & [Devfolio](https://devfolio.co/) partnerships (in progress).\n\n*   Tons of smaller improvements and bug fixes.\n\nDuring the research and exploration of the ‘[apps framework](https://www.notion.so/Juicebox-Apps-Ecosystem-dfd59363bc894f328897e37a3b2bec54?pvs=21)’ and implementation of further features, we have uncovered new, deep learnings that have helped us understand the future of Juicebox.money. In summary, we have identified that:\n\n1.  The largest demand lies in fundraising, however, projects aren’t getting successfully funded. This is due to the underpinning funding mechanism being a mix of reward-based, donation-based, and token-based. These combinations do not instill ‘investor’ confidence, and we’ll continue to struggle to get projects successfully funded.\n2.  The complexity of [Juicebox.money](http://Juicebox.money) and the *multiple* value propositions make it extremely difficult for users to discover, understand, and use. We try to do many things poorly, instead of one thing well.\n\nSee full breakdown of analysis here: <https://grand-popcorn-c81.notion.site/Juicebox-Observations-Analysis-de898d70057f40b9bfebe001657e9d58?pvs=4>\n\n### The next 7 cycles & beyond\n\nPeel's short-term future focuses on stabilizing JBM, allowing for a smooth, bug-free experience — and its long-term future focuses on producing value-driven dApps built upon the Juicebox protocol.\n\n#### Responsibilities:\n\n1.  Commit to stabilizing JBM in the short to medium term, including:\n\n    1.  Critical bug management, and\n    2.  No new feature development, and\n    3.  Support critical contract versions and updates, and\n    4.  Support of new pay terminals (e.g. USDC, etc.).\n\n2.  Build and maintenance of Juice-SDK.\n\n3.  The design and build of the first few dApps to both cater to users' needs and kickstart the dev builder ecosystem, and\n\n4.  Focus on restructuring JBM to:\n\n    1.  Create clearer messaging around building dApps atop the protocol, and\n    2.  Eventually augmenting [Juicebox.money](http://Juicebox.money) to a suite of smaller dApps that reflect current functionality 1:1.\n\n5.  Ongoing individual dApp build in the medium to long term (on a per proposal basis).\n\n#### Goals:\n\n1.  Growth of the protocol by attracting more developer applications.\n2.  Growth of the JBDAO treasury ($).\n3.  Finding PMF across a range of smaller dApps.\n\n#### Example dApps:\n\n*   Token design & issuance\n*   Payroll\n*   NFT minting & sales\n*   Reward-based crowdfunding\n*   Token-based seed funding\n\nIn summary, we would be looking to take the learnings from JBM, and split them into focused dApps, where we can better serve the user's value proposition, rather than forcing them into the ‘everything app’.\n\nSee *full* breakdown of the proposal here: <https://grand-popcorn-c81.notion.site/Peel-Labs-A-new-era-of-Juicebox-fb044d2ad473437a880e82e254200f47?pvs=4>\n\n<span style=\"color: rgb(186, 55, 42);\"><strong>Note: The contents of this proposal would likely not see <em>all</em> of the mentioned dApps built, but rather a subset of the most impactful ones, in collaboration with the DAO.</strong></span>\n\n## Specification\n\nRenew payouts at $60,000 per FC to Peel (V3 project handle @peel) for 7 funding cycles.\n\n## Rationale\n\nWe believe finding a level of PMF is critical to the protocol and Juicebox’s success. We have struggled to do so, but believe we’ve landed on a promising area given our learnings to date. With the primary focus on simplifying & focusing, we believe it will make it easier to;\n\n1.  Market & attract users to Juicebox,\n2.  Educate users on product functionality, and\n3.  Fulfill user needs and value propositions.\n\nIn line with @jango’s comments \\[1] last proposal, Peel would like to focus on kickstarting more value-driven focused apps for users outside the immediate protocol ecosystem (\\~6 users):\n\n\\[1] <https://discord.com/channels/775859454780244028/1108207351686770771/1108782991385301244>\n\n## Risks\n\n*   Peel fails to help drive value to the DAO.\n*   Peel doesn’t find PMF with new direction.\n*   Peel’s projects don’t meet community expectations.\n\n## Timeline\n\nThis proposal should take effect immediately. It should be removed after 7 cycles.\n",

      "title": "JBP-437 - Fund RevNet Development",
      "content": "## Synopsis\n\nAllocate $75k towards RevNet (Revenue Network) development across three checkpoints.\n\n## Motivation\n\nIn principle, Juicebox allows anyone to bootstrap and operate a project over time with transparent guarantees and incentives, and to strike a balance between centralization and decentralization according to their needs.\n\nIn practice, Juicebox has proven highly effective for bootstrapping projects, but outside of JuiceboxDAO itself (and projects closely working with it), fewer projects have gone on to sustainably operate using it. Although many factors are likely at play, one possible explanation is that:\n\n1.  For projects ultimately aiming to operate in a centralized manner, the overhead of operating on Juicebox isn't worth it once the project has been funded. This makes sense – Juicebox's mechanisms are very useful for building trust while bootstrapping these projects, but once they are established, the risk of smart contract exploits, onboarding difficulties for new crypto users, ETH's volatility, and the burden of onchain management often lead these project owners to migrate to fiat banking or manually managing funds through a multisig. This is not due to Juicebox's shortcomings; rather, it is a byproduct of operating within the Ethereum ecosystem.[1](#user-content-fn-1)\n2.  Projects ultimately aiming to operate in a decentralized manner typically want to avoid having a project owner at all. Even if ownership can decentralize over time (e.g. via a multisig), the burden of governance and operation through a single point of failure (the project NFT) can prove cumbersome.\n\nThis issue applies to almost all governing and operative frameworks on Ethereum – even with tools like Governor Bravo, governance frequently becomes burdensome, and funding allocations can fail to reflect community wishes. These and other issues lead to community apathy and disengagement.\n\nRevNets[2](#user-content-fn-2) pose a solution to this problem: if a project operates entirely according to pre-determined rules and incentives, governance is no longer necessary, and a community can focus on their actual objectives instead of worrying about self-governing.\n\n## How RevNets Work\n\nRevNets are built on top of and extend the Juicebox protocol. RevNets are Juicebox projects, and anyone can deploy one. Like Juicebox projects, anyone can pay a RevNet with ETH and mint its tokens. RevNets start out minting 1 token per ETH, or if they use USD accounting, 1 token per USD worth of ETH.\n\nA RevNet's token issuance evolves over generations which last a pre-defined length of time (28 days, for example). Three parameters determine how its tokens are issued:\n\n1.  The **Entry Curve**. The cost to enter the network increases over time, incentivizing people to join sooner. The entry curve defines how much more expensive tokens become each generation. With a 5% entry curve, 5% fewer tokens are minted per ETH each generation.\n2.  The **Exit Curve**. Leaving the network (by burning tokens) reclaims some ETH from the network. The closer an exit curve is to 100%, the more ETH goes to the last participants to exit, and less ETH goes to the first participants to exit. This incentivizes participants to stay in the network longer. You can visualize and experiment with different exit curves [on Desmos](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/q9jwaefswq).\n3.  The **Boost**. For a pre-determined length of time (140 days, for example) after a RevNet's creation, a percentage of newly generated tokens are allocated to a specific address. This address could be a developer multisig, a staking rewards contract, an airdrop stockpile, or something else. When the boost period ends, this allocation drops to 0.\n\nRevNet creators can optionally pre-mint a number of tokens for themselves at the time of the network's creation. **RevNets have no owner.** Once they are deployed, their parameters are locked in place. Funds can only leave the network when people exit.\n\n## Why Use RevNets?\n\nSome options offer more centralized control, which can be helpful for bootstrapping project development, but can lead to issues on the path to decentralization. Other options prioritize decentralization, which can make it difficult to get a project off the ground.\n\nRevNets solve both of these problems: the network begins decentralized, but the boost can be used to incentivize bootstrapping efforts as needed. They also:\n\n*   Don't require governance.\n*   Treat all participants equally. [Devs, investors, and customers are all incentivized](https://jango.eth.limo/?id=3EB05292-0376-4B7D-AFCF-042B70673C3D) to participate in the growth of the network.\n*   Are impossible to rugpull.\n\nAs long as a network continues to grow, the amount of ETH that current participants can reclaim by exiting will continue to rise. The most a participant can lose is difference between the ETH they entered with and the amount of ETH they can get back by exiting at that time.\n\nRevNets won't be the best model for starting a hardware store, or for fundraisers where the owners need to maintain control. But for experimental software projects, ownerless social media networks, or new protocols like Juicebox, it offers a completely new type of model – one that might be able to out-compete traditional ones.\n\nRevNets are obviously experimental and there's no guarantee that this will work, but we think it's worth experimenting with.\n\n## What We're Building\n\n1.  A fully-featured frontend for creating, joining, exiting, and exploring RevNets. So far, peacenode has been leading the designs on [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/77qCG4RaG0T1qfDHpRS2zI/Retailismo) and Aeolian has begun implementing the [`revnet-app`](https://github.com/rev-net/revnet-app). A work-in-progress prototype is available on [revnet-app.vercel.app](https://revnet-app.vercel.app/net/1223).\n2.  A collection of Ethereum smart contracts to extend the Juicebox protocol, allowing anyone to create or interact with customized RevNets. Further contract development may include lockup or other helper contracts for managing boost allocations, or something else.\n\nRob from Open Esquire has been hanging around the Discord server and providing input – we'd like to secure his services in addressing RevNet's legal needs.\n\n## Specification\n\n1.  In the cycle following this proposal's approval, send $25,000 USD worth of ETH to the RevNet multisig[3](#user-content-fn-3) to fund ongoing development.\n2.  In the first cycle once both a production-ready frontend and the core RevNet contracts are deployed, send $25,000 USD worth of ETH to RevNet.\n3.  In the first cycle once $100,000 USD worth of ETH flows through RevNets (not including RevNet's own network), send $25,000 USD worth of ETH to RevNet.\n\nThese distributions should only be made with approval from at least 60% of the JuiceboxDAO multisig. The initial distribution will be sent to the RevNet multisig, but future distributions may be sent to the RevNet multisig, a Juicebox project, or a RevNet network as dictated by RevNet multisig signers.\n\n## Timeline\n\nWe're planning a four-week sprint to get the first version of a RevNet frontend out and to have contracts deployed, and to keep moving from there. If you're interested in helping out, join the [Retailism Discord server](https://discord.gg/6Zr7Rtv6Ea).\n\n## Risks\n\n1.  We're building complex software. There's always a risk of exploits, and this is particularly true of smart contract development.\n2.  For a variety of reasons, people might not want to use RevNets for their projects.\n3.  RevNet's economic models are untested, and might not work well in practice.\n4.  Development may take much longer than expected – it's hard to accurately project development timelines.\n\n## Further Reading\n\n1.

My illustrations are on almost every visual thing posted about Juicebox, the newsletter, twitter posts, the website. I hope to continue to spread Banny and friends across the crypto community and beyond. I believe (maybe i’m biased) but the art/illustrations/character design brings people in, and makes people interested and curious about the protocol. As Peel continues to explore making new interfaces and dapps for JB there will be a continued need for new illustrations and designs. I am currently working on the illustrations for the new educational section for the create flow. \n\n\\*\\* \\*\\*\n\n## Specification\n\n• Continue to make illustrations that will be used by the visibility team /discord / twitter / websites \n\n• Create and promote google form where people can input illustrations they want/need - that way to keep requests organized and I don't lose them in the Discord channel\n\n• Continue to work with Peel creating illustrations\n\n• Create a Slice store or use a made to order website where people can buy JB merch (Stickers/Hats/coozies/socks) \n\n• Continue to add new illustrations/gifs to the tenor/giffy keyboard \n\n \n\n\\*\\* \\*\\*\n\n## Rationale\n\nPeople love Banny and friends and it’s important to continue to spread these characters around the ecosystem! Juicebox is complex and the art/illustrations can aid tremendously in conveying information and adding a visual break for project owners that are trying to understand/grasp the features. \n\nArt isn’t just an afterthought in Juicebox; it’s a fundamental pillar alongside its amazing contracts and front-end. It's the visual identity of Juicebox, and maintaining its appeal is crucial for attracting new followers.\n\n## Risks\n\nWhat might go wrong?\n\nI don't create the art/illustrations people want. \n\n## Timeline\n\nWhen exactly should this proposal take effect? When exactly should this proposal end?\n\nEffective immediately (GC 57)  for the next 7 funding cycles \n\n \n\n**Examples of recent work:**\n\n \n\n![](https://nance.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmZwo9zthvqGtNEjL8unigQWdcnJh8gqL3hVhdHWJKpCoz)![](https://nance.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmTzjEBbragB5LV7uyJwy8SZe5sNr7PjjepmhCmRWWSP32)![](https://nance.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmVGa93k2Lq6nx3bLZzcT7DudvcVSVvHGM8pNgUeeFWMqa)![](https://nance.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmcmuQA97mDXX4PaztYoVVpc5f2o7ptTT8tbwKydJoYd8R)![](https://nance.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmdDcgreXqu6kRCrzUiVDFGoe7zC5yJjd35b7KQzVNiMh1)![](https://nance.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmQgEkp3aF5oWxfrdFK1EVQ27qDAog2qJCjV6WFEGAY6Hm)![](https://nance.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmXFaQBuhNtqTJud5dkWoSd6E5bNcEaoGvkixyvYbrne3y)![](https://nance.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmPDyBccYCC8nqNRR76weacgrEUfWYpfi6GGbgQo1vvzms)![](https://nance.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmWxij4ddoLZiWzzrGBvCFC7Vh1Md1MituZxrkknBpHjX6)![](https://nance.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmTcFGhAvGm7m7TMsY8ySXSFJkz2GR912NJcwb6TDLXpRS)![](https://nance.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmXHKorrmZ9fDhYr4ZTw43HEGpJr5hvUgCECnHfCcNo6s7)![](https://nance.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmT6CNoDndNmbuQNbz8Rz8u4m8LcAky9D97AujvxuYWtuS)![](https://nance.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmfXUpFffH3N3R5HWKwCTFDK5ZYk7p2JQHQTBMFYJy9o2E)![](https://nance.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmXpMPkFWP5dJMA25UqLJc2yiRCbmv3jMAEP3xk3kgYLs3)![](https://nance.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmYm68QFs6oZwNBG48cTAa3JWA9CjfVVQMAzpkpw3ZLkon)\n",

      "title": "JBP-424 - Renew 0xBA5ED",
      "content": "## Synopsis\n\nRenew the recurring payout for 0xBA5ED for 8 funding cycles. \n\n## Motivation\n\n0xBA5ED has been the third set of eyes that protects the protocol against any contract level errors that could lead to a major loss of funds. Without him code would be checked by 2 contributors which (although they are immensely good at their job) makes it easier for a small oversight to go unnoticed. \n\nIt would be hard for JuiceboxDAO to hire a replacement for 0xBA5ED as there is a high demand for smart-contract developers and a steep learning curve to learning all the intricacies of the Juicebox protocol.\n\nLast proposal I [reduced my payout with 20%](https://discord.com/channels/775859454780244028/1108872388499734528/1110356343023489034) to account for my focus shifting to Bananapus, because of this focus shift my role at Juicebox has temporarily become an assisting role while I lead the contract development for Bananapus. \n\nI expect the majority of the contract work at Bananapus to come to an end in the next 3 funding cycles and my focus to return to JBDAO. \n\n**I will not include any Bananpus work in this proposal.**\n\n\\- **Buyback delegate**: I have done multiple thorough reviews in which I have found some potential issues and improvements. Some of which I have implemented myself, others were implemented by the other members of contract-crew. \\\n\\- **Metadata library**: This is a very low level library that is hard to review, I have reviewed this multiple times, and have helped improve the code base for readability and patched the issues that were found. \\\n\\- **Terminal V3.1.1**: This upgrade was done to resolve some low severity bugs, I reviewed the terminal changes and proposed some changes. \\\n\\- **Other**: Various other smaller reviews, discussions on ideas/plans.\n\nWhat I hope to work on in the next cycles:\\\n\\- **Juicebox \"V4\"**: Various small additions to the core protocol will add more flexibility to the protocol along side naming changes that are more suitable for an L2 environment. More info [here](https://discord.com/channels/1096829416287510598/1096829418112045113/1141421567562223698) and [here](https://discord.com/channels/1096829416287510598/1096829418112045113/1141751624717565952)\\\n\\- **Multi-datasource**: To allow for delegates to be combined, for example combining the buyback delelgate and NFT rewards when a user pays.\\\n\\- **OpenGSN**: Finishing the OpenGSN integration for mainnet (and L2s) to allow projects to automatically perform distributions and execute multisig transactions. \n\nThe above are just some things I would like to work on and I think may be useful to the DAO/Protocol. However I will focus my time on what the DAO finds most important.\n\n## Specification\n\nFor the next 8 funding cycles pay (0xBA5ED) \\`0xb045708e396E20071324C1aed2E4CFB90A0764FE\\` $8,000 per funding cycle and keep him on the list of beneficiaries of reserved JBX.\n\n## Rationale\n\nSmart-contract developers are hard to hire because its new, niche and there is a high demand. 0xBA5ED is an experienced smart-contract developer and is comfortable with and has a good understanding of the Juicebox codebase.\n\n## Risks\n\n\\- Reduced quality or less code shipped than before.\\\n\\- 0xBA5ED could stop contributing.\\\n\\- Contract work at Bananapus could take longer than expected which leads 0xBA5ED to be in an assisting role for a longer time.\n\n## Timeline\n\nProposal will take effect immediately\n",

      "content": "## <span class=\"md-plain\">Synopsis</span>\n\n<span class=\"md-plain\">Renew recurring payout and reserved token beneficiary for zhape.eth.</span>\n\n## <span class=\"md-plain\">Motivation</span>\n\n<span class=\"md-plain\">zhape.eth hopes that he can continue to contribute to JuiceboxDAO, in the areas of visibility, community alignment, governance and translation synchronization, etc.</span>\n\n## <span class=\"md-plain\">Specification</span>\n\n<span class=\"md-plain\">Pay zhape.eth US$2,000 equivalent in ETH per funding cycle for 7 FCs, and keep him as a reserved token beneficiary. Arrange an one-time transfer of 1,000,000 JBX from the DAO's multisig to jbx.zhape.eth.</span>\n\n## <span class=\"md-plain\">Rationale</span>\n\n### <span class=\"md-plain\">What I have done in the past payout period</span>\n\n1.  <span class=\"md-plain\">Town Hall summaries. I have always been thinking that the JuiceboxDAO Town Hall is a very important window to peek into the ongoing development efforts and directions of our community. I have been trying my best to compile the content of this meeting into reports, adding context, history backgroud, images and links, to help other members who are not fully updated to ongoing matters grasp the gist of the topics discussed in these meetings. I use simple languages and re-organize the content if needed so that readers may find easier to understand.</span>\n\n    <span class=\"md-plain\">During last payout period from May 18th till August 15th, I have made 13 reports (the one on Juily 4th was not recorded), which can all be found here: </span><span class=\"md-link md-pair-s\" spellcheck=\"false\"><a href=\"https://docs.juicebox.money/town-hall/\">https://docs.juicebox.money/town-hall/</a></span>\n\n2.  <span class=\"md-plain\">Chinese version of town hall summaries. With the language barrier, it is not very easy for our Chinese speaking community members to join our conversation, grab information and understand more about Juicebox ecosystem and JuiceboxDAO, so I want to compile also the CN version so that they can get a routine update on what has been going on, and jump into the rabbit hole of Juicebox if they wish. The corresponding town hall cn versions are here: </span><span class=\"md-link md-pair-s\" spellcheck=\"false\"><a href=\"https://docs.juicebox.money/zh/town-hall/\">https://docs.juicebox.money/zh/town-hall/</a></span><span class=\"md-plain\"> .</span>\n\n    <span class=\"md-plain\">Also I have been trying to post CN tweets to briefly introduce the town hall subjects in their respective threads.</span>\n\n3.  <span class=\"md-plain\">Tweets of ongoing governance activities. At the beginning of every governance cycle, I will compile threaded Chinese tweets, on one hand to call out governance engagement, and on the other, to provide abstract information for every proposal, so that members can get the gist of them and thus do their own research easier.</span>\n\n    <span class=\"md-plain\">And when temp check ends and Snapshot voting begins, I will follow up with a tweet to give updates about discussions and relevant proposal changes.</span>\n\n    <span class=\"md-plain\">I have been doing this out of the thoughts of lowering the participation barrier for Chinese speaking members, so that hopefully they want to get more involved in our community activities.</span>\n\n    <span class=\"md-plain\">These tweets can be found in </span><span class=\"md-link md-pair-s\" spellcheck=\"false\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/zhape1112\">https://twitter.com/zhape1112</a></span><span class=\"md-plain\">, and with the help of re-tweeting from our official account </span><span class=\"md-link md-pair-s\" spellcheck=\"false\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/juiceboxETH\">https://twitter.com/juiceboxETH</a></span><span class=\"md-plain\">, hopefully they can reach out to people interested in Juicebox.</span>\n\n4.  <span class=\"md-plain\">Translation on the Juicebox project on Crowdin. I have been trying to keep the Chinese version of our website updated with the changes made.</span>\n\n5.  <span class=\"md-plain md-expand\">A mod in the JuiceboxDAO Discord CN channels. I have been sharing updated info of Juicebox ecosystem with our members, as well as answering their questions and etc.</span>\n\n### <span class=\"md-plain\">What I am going to do in the next payout period</span>\n\n<span class=\"md-plain\">I want to keep working on the all the above-mentioned areas, because I think they are still going to create value for our ecosystem and community.</span>\n\n<span class=\"md-plain\">I will also try to do whatever would help add value to our ecosystem and community.</span>\n\n## <span class=\"md-plain\">Risks</span>\n\n<span class=\"md-plain\"> I am not as responsible for my job, or I fail to deliver what I promised.</span>\n\n## <span class=\"md-plain\">Timeline</span>\n\n<span class=\"md-plain md-expand\">If approved, this proposal will take effect from FC#56, and end after FC#62.</span>\n",

As long as JB devs continue to dev, there will be a need for materials that explain to the outside world why this all matters and how it might be useful. Matthew and Brileigh are the team best suited to producing this content.\n\n \n\n## Recent work\n\n### **🍊 Collaboration with Peel**\n\nThe frontend team at Peel is shipping new product features and bug fixes weekly and M+B have worked closely over the last three months to announce updates and keep the community better informed about [juicebox.money](http://juicebox.money/)**.** M+B have also contributed to website copy, helped bug test new features, and worked with TJL on outbound campaigns (e.g. hackathon pitch).\n\n*   Announced new Project Page ([YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUVi49oAcRQ) + [Docs](https://docs.juicebox.money/blog/project-page-updates/)), Project Updates & Bookmarks ([Discord](https://discord.com/channels/775859454780244028/875385915290292225/1131301417802547270), [YouTube,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y8ZIlrzcfrM) [Docs](https://docs.juicebox.money/blog/project-update-feature/)), and Rich Text & Images in Project Descriptions (upcoming)\n*   Bug tested new features prior to official announcements (e.g. WYSIWYG editor <https://discord.com/channels/939317843059679252/1131087407421337621/1135974024875356241>)\n*   Website copy for Success Stories section (e.g. <https://juicebox.money/success-stories/constitutiondao>),\n*   Kickstarter/Indiegogo/GoFundMe comparison articles (e.g. <https://docs.juicebox.money/blog/kickstarter-vs-juicebox/>) featured in [juicebox.money](http://juicebox.money) footer\n*   Use Case articles (e.g. <https://docs.juicebox.money/blog/jb-for-fundraising/>) featured in [juicebox.money](http://juicebox.money) footer\n*   Writing copy and editing for Hackathon pitch deck (<https://discord.com/channels/939317843059679252/1062534711878094888/1133205858923319306>), WYSIWYG editor template (<https://discord.com/channels/939317843059679252/1131087407421337621/1133607286623965275>), Create Flow educational materials (upcoming)\n\n![](https://nance.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmZ4zMc7sEJPZErdKzS9ggM7GfPajcAuG9zUDWrUWrQarg)\n\n<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUVi49oAcRQ>\n\n \n\n### 📚 **Educational Content**\n\nJuicebox can feel complex and hard to understand for new project creators, contributors, and devs. Each of these audiences needs to feel confident in Juicebox in order to create a project, contribute to a project, or develop an extension.\n\nM+B have consistently produced high-quality educational material that helps make Juicebox more comprehensible, breaks down primitives, and gives users confidence that there are trustworthy people behind the protocol.\n\n*   Juicebox for Fundraising on [YouTube](https://youtu.be/LvmWu895s6g) and [Docs](https://docs.juicebox.money/blog/jb-for-fundraising/)\n*   Juicebox for Non-Profits and Charities on [YouTube](https://youtu.be/FfXhLQ_rtEU) and [Docs](https://docs.juicebox.money/blog/jb-for-charity/)\n*   Juicebox for Open-Source Software and Developers on [YouTube](https://youtu.be/U_TWyTHp304)\n*   Kickstarter vs Juicebox on [YouTube](https://youtu.be/XDhaGvKFDNQ) and [Docs](https://docs.juicebox.money/blog/kickstarter-vs-juicebox/)\n*   Indiegogo vs Juicebox on [YouTube](https://youtu.be/XDhaGvKFDNQ) and [Docs](https://docs.juicebox.money/blog/indiegogo-vs-juicebox/)\n*   GoFundMe vs Juicebox on [YouTube](https://youtu.be/njfYtlHm2dg) and [Docs](https://docs.juicebox.money/blog/gofundme-vs-juicebox/)\n*   Solidity Sesh ep1 (Buyback Delegate) with Jango, DrGorilla, and Viraz on [YouTube](https://youtu.be/ZFZ03Jj5mKM)\n*   Solidity Sesh ep2 (Payment Terminals) with Jango on [YouTube](https://youtu.be/CWkmCh0wjdg)\n*   Juicebox delegate contract demo with Jango for Buidl Guidl Hackathon on [YouTube](https://youtu.be/GKI_fbxkg44)\n*   June 28th Twitter Space with Jango for Buidl Guidl Hackathon on [YouTube](https://youtu.be/tj9kw8D-UVQ)\n\n![](https://nance.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmQ6PQ7mc72prPUhEqXhVSFJdzkizaXnpToArF2DcwRZnV)\n\n<https://www.youtube.com/@JuiceboxDAO/videos>\n\n \n\n### 🎙 **The Juicecast**\n\n[The Juicecast](https://podcast.juicebox.money) is a cultural anthropology of crypto and DAOs featuring interviews with community members in the Juicebox ecosystem and beyond.

Newcomers to town hall often mention JBDAO YouTube as one of their first introductions to Juicebox and the metrics support this.\n\nOver the last 90 days, nearly half (14/30) of the top tweets by # of impressions that mentioned [@juiceboxETH](https://twitter.com/juiceboxETH) or linked to [juicebox.money](http://juicebox.money) were authored by M+B or related to content produced by M+B.\n\nFor transparency, all metrics related to our contributions can be found in the spreadsheet [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1m_XAUugouzRsYraL0Yskk-wme_jkhplcUlv-wcoXQ5Y/edit?usp=sharing).\n\n \n\n## **Upcoming work**\n\n**🍊** Working closely with the Peel team to bug test and announce new features, develop in-app educational materials, and produce content that helps users use Juicebox with confidence\n\n📚 Educational content like the use case videos that help build Juicebox mental models as well as evergreen content that breaks down core Juicebox primitives like Cycles and Payouts\n\n💻 Dev-facing content like Solidity Sesh that helps bring new devs into the ecosystem to build on top of Juicebox\n\n🎙️ Hosting and producing [The Juicecast](https://anchor.fm/thejuicecast) as a cultural anthropology of Juicebox and a storytelling vehicle for builders within the ecosystem and beyond\n\n📰 Based on temp check feedback, going forward we will reevaluate lower performing initiatives and put more energy towards new experiments\n\n \n\n## Expenses\n\nFor the last year or so, M+B have incurred the following expenses as contributors to JBDAO:\n\n*   Adobe CC suite (2 seats) = 109.98 USD per month\n*   Riverside Pro = 29.00 USD per month\n*   Canva Pro (1 seat) = 14.99 USD per month\n*   MailerLite Growing Business plan = $10.00 USD per month\n*   CapCut Pro = 7.99 USD per month\n*   Screen Studio license = 89.00 USD one-time\n*   Reincubate Camo = 79.99 USD one-time\n\n \n\n## Specification\n\nAdd $6000 USD recurring payout from Cycle 55 to Cycle 61 (inclusive) to Project 552 (<https://juicebox.money/@juicecast>) from the V3 treasury.\n\nIf JBP-418 is approved, add a $9000 USD recurring payout to Project 552 (<https://juicebox.money/@juicecast>) from Cycle 55 to Cycle 59 (inclusive) instead.\n\n \n\n## Rationale\n\nWe are proposing to renew our payout to reflect the continued workload and output that we have established over the last several months.\n\n \n\n## Risks\n\n*   Matthew might lose his streak in the gm channel (currently 507)\n*   The Juicecast might be deemed a security by Gary Gensler\n\n \n\n## Timeline\n\nThis proposal should take effect immediately and last seven (7) funding cycles, starting in Cycle 55 and ending in Cycle 61 (inclusive).\n",

      "title": "JBP-420 - Renew Filip",
      "content": "It's worth continuing to pay $8,400 per cycle and sending an additional 3m JBX to filipv for:\n\n1.  Continued development of independent projects. Over the last 7 cycles, I made:\n\n*   [`juicebox-tweeter`](https://github.com/filipviz/juicebox-tweeter), a tool to send out Twitter notifications when new projects are created on Juicebox.\n*   [`juicebox-heartbeat`](https://github.com/filipviz/juicebox-heartbeat), the tool which powers `# 💓｜heartbeat` in JuiceboxDAO's Discord and `# 🤖-juice-notifications` in Peel's Discord.\n*   [G.R.E.G.](https://github.com/filipviz/greg), a tool which processes, transcribes, and summarizes town hall audio and can be used for other meetings.\n*   [`jb-chat-cli`](https://github.com/filipviz/jb-chat-cli), a CLI proof of concept for using LLMs to guide Juicebox project configuration.\n*   [`discord-summaries`](https://github.com/filipviz/discord-summaries), a tool which fetches activity across a Discord server and summarizes it using LLMs.\n*   [`bannygpt`](https://github.com/filipviz/bannygpt), a website which uses LLMs to assist Juicebox project creators.\n*   (Still WIP) [`bananapus.com`](https://github.com/Bananapus/bananapus.com), a frontend for the `bananapus-721-delegate`. This will be live soon.\n*   (Never shipped) I created a merkle claiming [frontend and server](https://github.com/Bananapus/bananapus-rewards) for Bananapus.\n\nI'm getting better at programming over time and hope to spend more time doing this going forwards. My planned work includes (in order):\n\n*   Finishing and publishing the `bananapus.com` MVP.\n*   Significantly upgrading `bannygpt` with a more capable LLM, a larger context window, better data, and a more user-friendly interface. I will also experiment with various embedding models to see if they yield any improvement over the current model ([Sentence Transformers](https://www.sbert.net/) `all-MiniLM-L6-v2`). I plan to continue studying LLMs and to incorporate them in more sophisticated projects in the future – some examples are: a natural language Juicebox project risk assessor, project creator assistance built into juicebox.money, and an LLM to help developers explore Juicebox's technical docs.\n*   Making `discord-summaries` more configurable and building a frontend for it. It should function as a mostly automated SaaS product. Initial feedback suggests that this will be very useful for JuiceboxDAO members.\n\n2.  Contributions to projects within the Juicebox ecosystem. Within the past seven cycles, I :\n\n*   Added a [\"How it Works\" page](https://github.com/BallKidz/defifa-interface/pull/70) and [updated the copy throughout](https://github.com/BallKidz/defifa-interface/pull/86) Defifa's [website](https://defifa.net).\n*   Created a [PR to update copy](https://github.com/blunt-fund/interface/pull/1) throughout [blunt.fund](https://blunt.fund/).\n*   Submitted [several pull requests](https://github.com/jbx-protocol/juice-interface/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Afilipviz+) to juicebox.money, including copy updates, bug fixes, a new [legal resources page](https://juicebox.money/legal) for project creators, and multiple legal improvements suggested by Robert Leonhard from [Open Esquire](https://openesq.tech/) (who I have retained to provide legal advice pertaining JuiceboxDAO). I have learned enough about the law to write basic drafts which I can send to Rob (or another legal expert) to finalize.\n\n3.  Onboarding and helping project creators. Outside of projects related to JuiceboxDAO, I have personally helped out the project creator associated with every project [currently trending on juicebox.money](https://juicebox.money/projects). Over the past 7 cycles, I have helped the project creators associated with:\n\n*   [MijaniDAO](https://juicebox.money/@mijanidao)\n*   [Edu3Labs DAO](https://juicebox.money/v2/p/531)\n*   [Bobo's Big Top DAO](https://juicebox.money/@bobosbigtop)\n*   [$Pepe sponsors Hibernian FC](https://juicebox.money/v2/p/546)\n*   [Legends](https://juicebox.money/v2/p/548)\n*   [DomainDAO](https://juicebox.money/p/domaindao)\n*   [Thirsty Thirsty](https://juicebox.money/v2/p/507)\n\nI also helped the [Buidl Guidl](https://juicebox.money/@buidlguidl) project and projects made by Hackathon entrants through my role running the Hackathon. This is based on a quick scroll through juicebox.money, and I may be forgetting some projects. I also worked on several projects which didn't come to fruition, respond to most messages from `https://juicebox.money/contact`, and have ongoing email correspondence with several project creators. I plan to keep helping project creators going forwards.\n\n4.  Operations.\n\n*   I queue, coordinate, and execute most multisig transactions.\n*   I'm heavily involved with DAO governance. I wrote 13 of the 28 proposals in the previous 7 cycles – of note were [Shut Off v1.1/v2 JBX Minting](/s/juicebox/403), [Sponsor Buidl Guidl NFT Delegate Hackathon](/s/juicebox/401), [Implement Buyback Delegate; Deploy JBX Liquidity Pool](/s/juicebox/408), [Migrate to JBETHPaymentTerminal3\\_1\\_2](/s/juicebox/411), and several proposals made this cycle.\n*   I manage the DAO's software subscriptions – Figma, Notion, Google, and other things as they come up.\n*   I manage and moderate the DAO's Discord server, and help out with Discord servers for project creators and projects within the ecosystem.\n*   I'm involved with the implementation of most governance proposals.\n\n5.  Ongoing management and improvement of [docs.juicebox.money](https://docs.juicebox.money). You can see my contributions on [GitHub](https://github.com/jbx-protocol/juice-docs/commits/main).\n\nSome [messages from](https://discord.com/channels/775859454780244028/1060606131946401802/1111334907235553380) the most recent Code4rena contest:\n\n> *I can't overstate how much I like these docs*\n>\n> *yeah docs are really good*\n>\n> *wow the docs are great*\n>\n> *The project has excellent docs.*\n\nJango likely wrote much/most of the docs being described here though.\n\n6.  Running events.\n\n*   I proposed and helped to run the Code4rena audit of the Buyback Delegate (although Dr. Gorilla did most of the actual work responding to questions).\n*   I proposed and helped to run the Delegate Hackathon (although Jango did most of the actual work responding to questions).\n\n7.  Security.\n\n*   Helped Jango mitigate and wrote the postmortem for the issue described here: [v1 Payouts Post Mortem](https://docs.juicebox.money/dev/resources/post-mortem/2023-06-05/).\n*   Remediation and postmortem for the issue described here: [2023-07-24 – Hold Fees Calculation Error](https://docs.juicebox.money/dev/resources/post-mortem/2023-07-24/).\n*   Various frontend bug fixes.\n\n8.  Miscellaneous.\n\nOver the past seven cycles, I've participated in several Twitter spaces, been a guest on the DAO Deep Dives podcast, and gave a guest lecture about Juicebox at NYU. I've worked on some other things omitted from this proposal for brevity – you can see more in the `# ☝｜standup` channel and on [GitHub](https://github.com/filipviz).\n\nIf JBP-418 is approved, this should be a $12,600 payout for 5 cycles instead.\n",

      "content": "## Synopsis\n\n*Pay Sagekellyn.ETH  a one time payout of 4k to produce as much merch as possible to get in the hands of the people! The one time payout of 4K will be to cover cost of production and distribution. The goal is to have a bunch of merch to bring the ETH NYC to handout to people to spread Banny and friends to the world! *\n\n \n\n## Motivation\n\n*What problem does this solve? Why now?*\n\n*It's important to get as much merch out into the hands of the people as possible! Be that through hackathons, global ETH events, or just to the people that are currently contributing. Stickers are cheap, small and transport easily, so they are a great way to gorilla market Juicebox. We hope to collaborate with JB hackathons to get merch into the hands of people participating in these events too.*\n\n*We need to get as many beautiful stickers, tank tops, funky hats, etc in the hands of anyone who wants one. people should trust me to design these goods and Mieos to help distribute them. Last ETH NYC with the help of ZomBae, Mieos and countless others we were able to hand out hundreds of stickers, ice cream, shirts and introduce a ton of people walking around NYC to Juicebox. We want to do it again! *\n\n*I plan to be in NYC for ETH NYC in September and hope to have a bunch of merch printed and ready to hand out to people during the event. I know that merch doesn't directly correlate with project creation but if the JB merch becomes its own identity and brand then it can become a successful project in itself.*\n\n \n\n \n\n## Specification\n\n*How exactly will this be executed? Be specific and leave no ambiguity.*\n\n*a one time payout of 4000$ to Sagekellyn.eth to pay for the production and shipping costs of merch. This includes shirts, hats, stickers, socks etc. that will be all free in order to spread more awareness to Juicebox.  Hoping to do a massive run of sticker packs (maybe 7-10 different stickers), a big run of hats (2-3 variations) , and a smaller run of shirts (maybe 60 shirts) since they require more specificity with sizes and harder to ship and more expensive. I will create a form that people can input their info (happy to ship to local post offices/drop boxes so people don't have to give actual address) - We can work this out over the next week to find the best means of distribution. All merch will be on a first come first serve basis with 50% saved to be brought to NYC.  Any left over will be sent out to people as well. *\n\n \n\n## Rationale\n\n*Why is this specification appropriate?*\n\n*We've tried to do merch runs before that always seem to fall short. I think the problem is that we are asking people to pay and it gets complicated with ETH and physical goods. So get rid of the payment part and lets just mass ship merch to people. Not to toot my own horn but we got some killer illustrations out there that deserve to be printed and on peoples computers, water bottles and bodies! *\n\n \n\n## Risks\n\n*What might go wrong?*\n\n*People might not want merch*\n\n \n\n## Timeline\n\n*When exactly should this proposal take effect? When exactly should this proposal end?*\n\n*GC-55 one time payout*\n",

      "title": "JBP-414 - Renew DrGorilla.eth (contract engineering)",
      "content": "**Synopsis**\n\n*State what the proposal does in one sentence.*\n\n*   Keep DrGorilla.eth in JuiceboxDAO recurring payouts, without compensation change, for another 8 cycles, under the quality of software engineer focused on contract and blockchain engineering.\n\n**Motivation**\n\n*What problem does this solve? Why now?*\n\nDrGorilla.eth has been poking holes into the protocol for a lil less than 2 years now, as software engineer (working mostly on the smart contract side). Offering to renew DrG's payout (and, therefore, to keep using gorilla's code) solves 2 issues:\n\n*   software engineers (and especially blockchain/solidity focused ones) are hard to find and to keep\n*   Juicebox has been growing into a big codebase, with a pretty steep learning curve, increasing the need to have developers at ease with the shadiest corners of it (DrG loves shady corners)\n\nDrGorilla.eth has been working on the following piece of codes recently (and might forget some other minor projects/non-core thingies) - as the previous similar proposals, some projects were scheduled, others not, and some others were dropped. DrG roles is first and foremost reactive (to business needs) then proactive (improvement/safety and coding creativity driven).\n\n*   Juice metadata library (author) + implementation in existing delegates: this is a core piece in supporting multiple delegate as it allows having data passed to specific delegate (ie this takes multiples data for multiple delegate then build a small \"dictionary\" which can then be used to easily find these data). This project is done.\n\n*   Buyback delegate (author): This pay datasource and delegate allows to use an Uniswap V3 liquidity pool as source for a project token. This gives payers (individuals or other project) the best rate between funding cycle weight and Uniswap, while sustaining secondary market price (if under the minting rate). This project is done.\n\n*   C4 BBD (author/victim): Code4arena audits can be painful, as it requires answering lots of questions and reviewing lots of not-so-funny findings. DrG lead and supported this C4 audit of the Buyback delegate.\n\n*   Delegate registry (author): As new needs/use-cases arise, DrG has been extending the delegate registry (which provide a list of delegate to the frontend, to determine which one is from a \"trusted\" deployer)\n\n*   Terminal 3.1.1+3.1.2 (reviewer/tester): See JBP-140 (\n\n    <https://www.jbdao.org/s/juicebox/410)>\n\n    \\- DrG has been mostly helping in review and testing the new terminals \n\n*   721 (reviewer/tester): DrG has been doing a similar role of reviewing and testing the latest development.\n\nDrGorilla.eth offers to pursue working on (if no other more urgent needs come up):\n\n*   Multi-datasource and -delegate supports: the metadata library was a first step (as it solves the metadata problem), other issues still need a solution (eg how to reconciliate multiple weight? How to determine delegate allocation from the datasource? etc)\n\n*   Optimise the multi metadata lib: while the current version is fairly gas efficient, DrG is convinced having a low-level language (aka Yul) might gives a bit more saving. As the protocol peripheral contracts interactions grows, every marginal gain in gas *needs to* be actively hunted down.\n\n*   New token supports: terminals *should* be allowing them easily, 2 things needs to be tested and might require extra-work: oracle (and limitations/safety guards) and inter-terminal interaction (for project having ETH and USDC for instance, how to process this in delegates? Are redemptions correctly computed? etc)\n\n*   Protocol safety: on top of overall availability for protocol emergencies, we still lack resistant monitoring and alerting tool (this has been taken over from previous proposal, BBD/C4 having been prioritized by DrG in the meantime)\n\n*   Resume the \"smart treasury\" effort: a vault-terminal was being built, a while ago (AppleJuice Terminal) but never crossed the finish line. Having dormant ETH (or other token) doesn't make much sense, DrG would like to resume effort for having, at least, a way to stack ETH (while keeping redemption unchanged)\n\n*   Any other need which will arises (in the extreme unlike event the previously mentioned projects all came to an end before 7fc, DrG keeps a list of \"nice to have\"/LT todo's in the Contract Crew Github project -\n\n    <https://github.com/orgs/jbx-protocol/projects/5>\n\n    \\- this hasn't been updated recently tho)\n\n**Specification**\n\n*How exactly will this be executed? Be specific and leave no ambiguity.*\n\n*   Renew DrGorilla.eth payout of 15000$/cycle (transferred to the Exhausted Pigeon project (421), home of the gorilla), for a standard 8 cycles duration\n*   Execute a one-time transfer of 2m $JBX from the multisig balance to DrGorilla.eth\n\nNB: If JBP-418 is approved, pay Exhausted Pigeon (421) 22500$/cycle for 5 cycles instead\n\n**Rationale**\n\n*Why is this specification appropriate?*\n\n*   \"We are not rekt\" && \"We use DrG code\" => \"code good\": under this logic fallacy, DrG tries to express his obsession for safe and efficient coding practices. And column-aligning source code (which is obviously prettier). By having acquired an extensive protocol knowledge (as part of the protocol came from his keyboard), DrG is a good asset for JuiceboxDAO.\n*   Compensation is inlined with Sr blockchain SWE freelance market rates (a bit below average, a tad less than 200$/h) - DrG asked chatGPT which agreed: <https://chat.openai.com/share/e332b52e-645f-4f46-8fad-09a696a80e33>\n*   Having a $JBX allocation increases the exposure to the JuiceboxDAO treasury, better aligning long-term incentives (DrG is open to deploying a vesting contract for these, if the DAO sees it as needed during debates/temp check)\n\n**Risks**\n\n*What might go wrong?*\n\nDrGorilla might disappear or starts producing low quality code.\n\nDrGorilla might start acting like an actual gorilla (again), and subsequently throw faeces on people.\n\n**Timeline**\n\n*When exactly should this proposal take effect? When exactly should this proposal end?*\n\nNext cycle start.\n",

      "title": "JBP-419 - Reduce Multisig to 6/9",
      "content": "## Synopsis\n\nMake JuiceboxDAO's multisig a 6/9 multisig with updated membership.\n\n## Motivation\n\nIt has become more difficult to get transactions signed and executed in time, which has led to several close calls in executing governance. In the event of an exploit or another situation where the multisig needs to move fast, this could pose a major risk.\n\nIn my view, a larger multisig may actually *decrease* DAO security by spreading the burden of verification, making signers feel less individual responsibility for ensuring that transactions have been properly queued. When queuing transactions for [JBP-384](https://snapshot.org/#/jbdao.eth/proposal/0x622de9370ec22833962b5630680f93dd9e1b8380af9a42d747a166337a7ab229), I set the memo for the v2 `reconfigureFundingCyclesOf(...)` transaction as:\n\n> Verification check. If you see this, directly message Filip a cowboy emoji.\n\nI only received cowboy emojis from twodam and 0xBA5ED. This was a complex multisend transaction and may not have been representative, but it seems likely that most multisig members are not carefully verifying each part of every transaction.\n\n## Context\n\nThe last multisig membership update was completed on nonce 175.

If this proposal passes, multisig ownership will be updated to include 9 addresses which receive the most votes. The threshold shall at all times remain at the lowest possible number greater than the total number of multisig owner accounts times 0.6.\n\nProspective multisig signers may designate another address which they prefer to the one listed in this proposal.\n\n## Risk\n\nThere may be risks associated with being on the multisig.\n\nA smaller multisig is more susceptible to internal collusion.\n\n## Timeline\n\nTo be completed within 21 days of this proposal's approval.\n",

      "content": "## Synopsis\n\nSponsors nowonder to explore developer relations with [Sablier](https://sablier.com/) by way of developing a [Sablier](https://sablier.com/)[ v2](https://sablier.com/) Juicebox [Treasury Extension](https://docs.juicebox.money/dev/build/treasury-extensions/), and to generate Juicebox educational materials by building and documenting in the open.\n\nnowonder [(Juicebox/BuidlGuidl Delegate Hackathon Winner)](https://twitter.com/Juicebox_Money/status/1684668585766002688?s=20) will be the project manager and will allocate resources appropriately towards the success of the project.\n\n## Motivation\n\n1.  Build relations with a group building interesting financial primitives that may be useful in the future\n2.  Extend JB Educational materials on building Treasury Extensions \n3.  Explore the vibes surrounding new experimental primitives:\n\n[Streaming payrolls](https://docs.sablier.com/concepts/protocol/streaming) via Juicebox Projects.\n\n[Cancelling a stream](https://docs.sablier.com/contracts/v2/guides/stream-management/cancel) could be useful if we imagine a JB Project that wants to pay it's contributors for upcoming work, if the contributor isn't meeting their obligations, a stream could be cancelled with the remaining funds being transferred back to the project. This feature is optional. \\\n\\\n[Transferring a stream](https://docs.sablier.com/contracts/v2/guides/stream-management/transfer) could be useful in the event that a contributor cannot meet their obligations, and wants to transfer their workload and payout to someone else without needing to call a vote. This is also optional.\n\n## Specification\n\nAs suggested by Jango ([here](https://discord.com/channels/775859454780244028/1115701926978408478/1134196686693072957), and [here](https://discord.com/channels/775859454780244028/1115701926978408478/1134473996105154700)),\\* \\*JuiceboxDAO will pay out $2150 worth of ETH to [Sablier V2 Interop Dev](https://juicebox.money/v2/p/549) to begin development (the extra $150 to cover deployment fees), and another $2000 worth of ETH upon completion.\n\n### Completion / MVP:\n\n*Estimated duration: 2 weeks*\\\n\\\n*FTE: 80 Hours*\n\n*   A [Treasury Extension](https://docs.juicebox.money/dev/build/treasury-extensions/) enabling JB Project Operator Config/Management (CRUD) of Sablier v2 streamed payouts\n*   E2E tests to confirm functionality and security\n*   Documented building process (a technical write-up)\n*   Posit the features to some Juicebox Projects and record their feedback\n*   Show off our work to Sablier and record feedback\n\n*Note: There may be other features to explore, like a pay delegate that streams Project Tokens. If I finish the MVP deliverables in time, I'll continue to expand on and experiment with features/extensions in this same vein.*\n\n## Risks\n\nAt worst, we create educational materials on Treasury Extensions and build relations with a protocol that's developing financial primitives.\n\n## Timeline\n\nThis cycle / ASAP\n",

Jango and Dr. Gorilla have resolved this issue and made several other minor improvements in the new [3.1.2 payment terminals](https://github.com/jbx-protocol/juice-contracts-v3/pull/51). JuiceboxDAO should migrate to this terminal once it is reviewed and deployed.

Errors may occur during the migration process.\n2.  This process has a time contraint – it must be implemented before the buyback delegate, which must be fully implemented by September 19th, 2023.\n3.

      "content": "## Synopsis\n\nIt's worth continuing to pay $12,000 per cycle and sending an upfront additional 2,000,000 JBX to Breadfruit for:\n\n1.  Jango's continued contributions to the core protocol's stability and extensibility.\n\n    1.  Lead co-author of the 3.1.1 and 3.1.2 terminals.\n    2.  Lead co-author of 721Delegate version 3.2 and 3.3.\n    3.  Co-author of Buyback delegate.\n    4.  Reviewer of JBDelegateMetadataLibrary.\n\n2.  Jango's continued contributions to protocol education and integration across the ecosystem.\n\n    1.  Work with Peel and client teams to help ensure the protocol is being interacted with correctly.\n    2.  Help with templates and comms that make hackathons more approachable for devs. Lots more I can do here.\n\n3.  Jango's being on-call to help lead the DAO through protocol emergencies.\n\n    1.  No emergencies lately, but we did have a few postmortems that I contributed quick research, troubleshooting, and sensible solutions to, adopted in 3.1.1 and 3.1.2 terminals and juicebox.money fixes.\n    2.  It’s still safer to assume that something unexpected is likely to happen, which might require timely attention from people with a wide understanding of how Juicebox protocol and JuiceboxDAO works.\n\n## Motivation\n\nLots of works-in-progress right now. I've spent the past 4 months trying to understand how to best deploy projects I've been helping build -- like Croptop and Defifa -- as efficient public networks. This exercise kept me tugging at the JB protocol foundation to find designs that give its core levers some meaningful shape.\n\nAt the same time, I watched DrGorilla, Viraz, 0xBa5ed, Jacopo, Nicholas, and several hackathon participants give their efforts to create powerful contract stuff, my friends at Peel, Defifa and Blunt give their efforts to create intuitive and welcoming UXs for folks to interact with the powerful contract stuff, Juicecast and Juicenews try to give a personal dimension to what the heck all this powerful contract stuff is all about, many folks try to describe the powerful contract stuff in documentation, and a handful of projects try to leverage all this community effort to give a powerful juicy shape to their projects.\n\nInso doing, I've helped identify, fix, and navigate the DAO through important bugs, authored core improvements to the core protocol, and have been left with a handful of persisting takeaways.\n\nTechnical takeaways:\n\n*   BuybackDelegate is crucial for efficient treasury designs. It needs to be lean and mean, and I think it'll be a common feature of treasury designs. This has been a long and delicate body of work by the entire contract crew, and is at the finish line. Special shouts DrGorilla as the lead author.\n*   Data Sources need to have the ability to pass arbitrary data to the delegates it invokes. This was implemented in terminal 3.1.1.\n*   Multi-delegate is immediately needed so that delegates like the 721Delegate can be used on a project that also has the BuybackDelegate installed. This standard is currently being applied to the upcoming BuybackDelegate, as well as an upcoming 721Delegate version.\n*   Treasuries that manage all money access through redemptions are just as interesting as those which rely more on payouts. JuiceboxDAO should align its membership fee with redemption alongside payouts. This was implemented in terminal 3.1.1.\n*   I'm excited to continue researching and experimenting with unowned project designs. They have intriguing cultural properties and may have solid regulatory standing.\n*   I'm very optimistic on the Bananapus multi-chain strategy of building organization tentacles across chains. As chains pop up left and right, its increasingly clear organizations need to be able to exist across them. There's been some exciting recent prototype progress.\n*   The DAO should support getting multi-token projects right. This is an under-used and under-explored, but highly in demand part of the protocol. We should explore product potential in juicebox.money, and also put pressure on the JBPrices contract extensibility to see if there are any improvements to be made that only reveal themselves when putting the code into practice.\n\nCultural takeaways:\n\n*   JB Pipeline:\n\n    *   Banny is by far the most effective top-of-funnel – double down.\n    *   Juicecast + onboarding calls + townhalls + jbdao-as-a-community add the human touch and are great middle chunk of the funnel – we can do more here with events and hackathons.\n    *   JBM as the iconic application for the ecosystem is a strong bottom of the funnel – continue delightfully teaching the specifics of how the protocol can be used and interpreted.\n    *   The protocol will always close out the deal at the end of the funnel – keep it safe, open, and well documented.\n    *   The funnel inevitably leads towards a value set defined by how the JuiceboxDAO treasury and governance are programmed.\n\n*   I’m looking forward to experimenting with Retailism, and am curious to study what might be its implications to JuiceboxDAO. What I was previously calling Tend Toward Zero might be shaping up more like Tend Toward Retailism.\n\n*   I’m looking forward to being able to work on projects — like Croptop and Defifa — without having to question the efficacy of the JB protocol foundation. There ended up being plenty of core work to do these past 4 months, and there may as well be these upcoming 4, but the goal is for it not to last much longer into the future. Nonetheless, I’m grateful to JuiceboxDAO for affording me a consistent payout as I help it navigate this more-unstructured complicated creative work of the moment.\n\n*   I hope my compensation soon reflects a future where I’m working for JuiceboxDAO more through my work on other projects instead of for it directly. I think it’s the most valuable thing I can contribute. Plus, we happen to be stewarding a network technology capable of economically appreciating the contribution of workers, customers, and investors alike.\n\nPersonal takeaways:\n\n*   I work with brilliant people that inspire me in so many different ways. Thank you all for your leadership helping shape this DAOs direction, and for giving me space to contribute my pieces. Thank you for consistently taking time to give feedback, and for taking into consideration all of the feedback that comes your way. Thank you for your confidence to be creative, to bring your points of view, and to leave things better than how you found them, despite our very delicate and unforgiving onchain environment and amorphous organizational structure. I don't know how we all got here but it's a god damn miracle. \n*   Lots to do.\n\n## Risks\n\nBreadfruit is operated by Jango, a fragile human being that could go poof.\n\n \n\n## Timeline\n\nNext funding cycle\n",

      "title": "JBP-408 - Implement Buyback Delegate; Deploy JBX Liquidity Pool",
      "content": "## Summary\n\nThis proposal involves:\n\n1.  Migrating JuiceboxDAO's project to the [`JBETHPaymentTerminal3_1_1`](https://docs.juicebox.money/dev/api/contracts/or-payment-terminals/jbethpaymentterminal3_1_1/).\n2.  Creating and funding a Uniswap v3 ETH<>JBX pool.\n3.  Deploying and adding a [buyback delegate](https://github.com/jbx-protocol/juice-buyback) for this pool to JuiceboxDAO's project.\n\n## Motivation\n\n### Buyback Delegate\n\nThe [buyback delegate](https://github.com/jbx-protocol/juice-buyback) contract is intended to maximize the number of project tokens payers receive from a project. If tokens are cheaper to buy from Uniswap than to issue from the project, payments go to Uniswap; otherwise, payments issue tokens from the project. This optimizes token acquisition for payers, drives the secondary market price towards the project's issuance rate, and reduces new token issuance.\n\n### Liquidity Pool\n\nThe current ETH<>JBX pool on Uniswap is a shallow pool which is for v1 JBX. The DAO should deploy a v3 JBX pool with sufficient liquidity to support the buyback delegate.\n\n### JBETHPaymentTerminal3\\_1\\_1\n\n`JBETHPaymentTerminal3_1_1` enforces JBX membership fees during redemptions when redemption rates are less than 100%, which slightly offsets the risk posed by high redemption volumes. It also addresses a minor bug and optimizes gas usage, which is important as all projects interact with JuiceboxDAO's ETH terminal when paying fees.\n\n## Steps\n\nReasonable modifications may be made to the following implemention details:\n\n1.  Multisig to set the JuiceboxDAO project's terminal to the [`JBETHPaymentTerminal3_1_1`](https://etherscan.io/address/0x457cD63bee88ac01f3cD4a67D5DCc921D8C0D573) (on the `JBDirectory`) and perform a terminal migration to the `JBETHPaymentTerminal3_1_1` at the same time via a multisend transaction.\n2.  Multisig to create a ETH<>v3 JBX pool on Uniswap v3 with a 1% fee, an initial price of 1,300,000 JBX/ETH, a minimum price of 10,000 JBX/ETH, and a maximum price of 2,000,000 JBX/ETH, and to deposit 10 ETH and 13,000,000 JBX into the pool. Allow the multisig to update this position at their discretion (9/14) in the 90 days following this proposal's approval.\n3.  Deploy a buyback delegate for use with [v3 JBX](https://etherscan.io/address/0x4554CC10898f92D45378b98D6D6c2dD54c687Fb2) and the new liquidity pool.\n4.  Adjust JuiceboxDAO's project to incorporate the buyback delegate and the `JBETHPaymentTerminal3_1_1`.\n\n## Justification\n\nMigration to `JBETHPaymentTerminal3_1_1` must take place before the delegate is added, as terminal migrations would necessitate the redeployment of the buyback delegate.\n\nThe proposed ETH<>JBX liquidity pool rates have been calculated based on the current issuance rate of 56,855 JBX/ETH. Assuming a successful passage of the [proposal to re-open redemptions](https://www.jbdao.org/s/juicebox/407) at a 90% redemption rate, initial redemptions would occur at \\~1,728,180 JBX/ETH. The present Uniswap rate is approximately 1,316,650 v1 JBX for 1 ETH.\n\nThe pool should be on Uniswap v3 because buyback delegate work began before Uniswap v4 was released, and the work that an upgrade would entail wouldn't be worth the minor upside (small gas savings under certain circumstances).\n\nThe steps pertaining to the buyback delegate itself are self-explanatory given this proposal's motivation.\n\n## Risks\n\nUnless the buyback delegate is removed, JuiceboxDAO will not receive ETH from fees until JBX's issuance cost is less than its Uniswap price. This would require substantial fee throughput and may never materialize. JBX will accumulate among project creators and reserved rate beneficiaries, which could render the delegate's removal unlikely or impossible (as they would likely vote against its removal).\n\nThis proposal also has:\n\n*   **Smart Contract Risks**: Even though the buyback delegate contract has been audited, there's always the risk of overlooked vulnerabilities.\n*   **Economic Risks**: The DAO may lose funds by providing liquidity non-optimally, and may face arbitrage risk from its liquidity position or the project via redemptions. This proposal could have unintended economic consequences, like a drop in the price of JBX due to higher than expected sell pressure.\n*   **Dependence on Uniswap**: The proposal relies heavily on the function of Uniswap, which could pose a risk if there are unexpected issues or changes to Uniswap.\n*   **Shallow Liquidity**: The liquidity pool might not be deep enough for the buyback delegate to reach sustainability. The DAO may need to deposit more funds down the line.\n*   **Multisig Risk**: This proposal allows the multisig to make discretionary transactions, which risks the multisig acting against the best interests of the DAO.\n*   **Operational Risks**: This proposal's implementation requires a coordinated effort from DAO members. Mistakes could be made.\n*   **Dependence on Contract Crew**: This proposal relies on the diligence and good faith of contract crew members.\n*   **Risk of Runaway Issuance Reduction**: The current issuance reduction rate (0.5%) may delay or outpace secondary market price alignment.\n\n## Timeline\n\nThe proposal should be implemented within 60 days following approval, under the discretion of the contract crew and the multisig.\n",

      "title": "JBP-407 - Increase redemption rate and re-open redemption on JuiceboxDAO treasury",
      "content": "## Synopsis\n\n Increase the redemption rate of JuiceboxDAO V3 treasury (<https://juicebox.money/@juicebox)> from 0% to 90%.\n\n## Motivation\n\n1.  Current redemption rate is 0%, which means an effective lock-down of redemption, while a redemption rate greater than 0% will open it up;\n2.  To give $JBX holders an option to ragequit, which has always been one of our most propagated metrics in the protocol to defend the interest of token holders;\n3.  To hopefully provide a price floor for $JBX on AMM exchange.\n\n## Specification\n\nReconfigure the Redemption Rate of JuiceboxDAO V3 project to 90%.\n\n## Rationale\n\n1.  As of the time of writing this proposal, the secondary market price of $JBX on Uniswap is around 3,176,780.00 JBX / ETH, which has deviated very far away from the cost of most contributors (donors) or owners of projects (when distributing funds out of Juicebox in exchange for $JBX). This can be, on one hand due to the pessimistic general market emotion, but on the other due to the fact that redemption which correctly reflects the backing value of $JBX has been effectively closed for a relatively long time. \n2.  The current balance of V3 treasury is 1,276.7297 ETH. Current total supply of $JBX is 2,089,776,033.3412  JBX. At a 90% reademption rate, the redemption value will be around 1,818,688.30 JBX / 1 ETH.\n3.  The current Uniswap liquidity pool is very illiquid, where 1 ETH can easily increase the price of JBX to/above its redemption value, I don't see any overwhelming imminent risk of arbitrage existing here.\n4.  The redemption rate had served a very good price floor for JBX in the first half of year 2022, I don't see the perspective contrary to it currently.\n5.  Return of reasonable price token prices can help to ensure the interest of contributors and project owners, in turn reinvigorating our governance involvement.\n\n## Risks\n\n1.  There can possibly be very high redemption demand due to the pessimistic market emotion, which definitely also affects the decisions of $JBX holders.\n2.  As the AMM LP pool is very shallow, there can be big holders choose to redeem, no matter what the difference between redemption value and secondary price. \n3.  \\*\\*Revelation of conflict of interest: zhape.eth has bought a considerable amount of JBX in the secondary market in the second half of last year and first half of this year, so my opinions might be biased towards my own interest. I should abstain from voting supportive of this proposal, although I also declare that i try my best to respect and abide by the JuiceboxDAO Foundation (<https://docs.juicebox.money/dao/foundation/)> and behave honestly following my heart.\\*\\*\n\n## Timeline\n\nIf approved, effective in the upcoming funding cycle.\n",

      "content": "## Synopsis\n\nRenew funding to the nance Juicebox project for $11,000 per funding cycle for 7 cycles **(total $77,000)**\n\n## Motivation\n\n### What we've done in last payout\n\nUpdates from previous proposal, [JBP-364](https://www.nance.app/s/juicebox/364):\n\n1.  **Attaching \"actions\" to a proposal** - This eases the burden on multisig members by clearly defining proposal actions that must be executed shall a proposal pass. The custom transaction action form built by twodam works very well for any multisig transactions that need to occur.\n2.  **Further improve proposal metrics** - to be implemented at a later date\n3.  **Create nance instance UI** - implemented a prototype, need improve UX and login with Discord to make it easy to use\n4.  **Explore different funding options -** once create nance instance is done this will be much more feasible to implement\n5.  **Integrate accounting -** to be implemented at a later date\n6.  **Public Read/Write for dolt -** since all changes to the SQL database are pushed to dolthub, the data is always available to be read publicly, writing publicly coming soon \n7.  **Documentation and about page -** coming first week in July...\n8.  **Improve forkability -** the github project page readme has been updated for ease of forkability such that anyone can host their own instance of the nance api\n9.  **Improve mobile site -** layout updates implemented\n\nNew features not specified in previous proposal:\n\n1.  **Voter profile page -** this page will display votes, created proposals and other stats of specified voter, try [https://www.jbdao.org/u/jigglyjams.eth?space=jbdao.eth](/u/jigglyjams.eth?space=jbdao.eth)\n2.  **Proposal Navigator -** this is shown at the bottom of all proposals, letting you easily navigate to the next proposal during temperature check or voting\\\n    **![](https://nance.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmPn5EJVpVhhEQqkEEgUVGqaerMQEY3x6QodqDfwrxjA1v)**\n3.  **Sign in with Ethereum (SIWE) -** In order to support private drafts (a frequently requested feature), SIWE was a required. After a lot of hold up trying to implement user sessions with cookies, we are nearly complete with merging in this feature.\n4.  **Proposal forking -** While viewing a proposal, you will now see a \"Fork Proposal\" button. This will prepopulate a new proposal with the previous proposal content, allowing you to edit before submitting.\n5.  **Genericizing frontend -** Frontend for nance is now deployed at both <https://jbdao.org> and [https://nance.app]()\n6.  **Onboard ThirstyThirsty -** Nance reminders are running in [ThirstyThirsty discord](https://discord.com/channels/914177743535636581/1063449668371107932) and proposals can be submitted, viewed, and voted upon at [https://nance.app/s/thirstythirsty](/s/thirstythirsty) \n7.  **Tenderly multicall simulation -** this allows nance to conglomerate transactions using gnosis safe multicall and ensure the calls will be successful (very useful for what we will focus on next #2)\n\n### What we will focus on next payout\n\n1.  **OpenZeppelin Governor integration (first client will be bananapus)** - Submit a Juicebox reconfiguration to a deployed OpenZeppelin Governor contract\n2.  **Multicall proposal queuing system -** Over the past few funding cycles we have observed filipv conglomerating several proposal transactions into a single multisig transaction using multicall. In order to ease this process we have designed a new approach that will allow multisig signers to select which proposals actions they want to be included in a single safe transaction. This should alleviate some of filipv's work. Jigglyjams has multicall working in Tenderly simulations (see here) and is able to output the transactions to a JSON file that can then be uploaded to Gnosis Safe UI. The next steps are to implement the frontend to choose which transactions are conglomerated. See sample flow below for details:\\\n    **![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1113532388488777788/1118728601915887646/image.png)\\\n    ![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1113532388488777788/1118728692609319054/image.png)**\n3.  **Create nance space UI -** This is essential to the growth of nance. Without a create space UI it is very difficult to onboard new members. Jigglyjams made a very simple UI but it required a user to copy paste many Discord IDs into the browser in order for nance to have all of the information it needs to do its automation. Adding sign in with Discord and using Discord's add a bad and channels API we can make it a much better experience to onboard a new organization.\n\n## Specification\n\n*Note: The [nance juicebox project](https://juicebox.money/v2/p/477) is owned by a 2/3 multisig with jigglyjams, twodam, and nicholas as the signers.*\n\nExpenses to operate nance are quite low **(\\~$140/month)**:\\\n![](https://nance.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmQqVAq5u3K6joqk6WvdofMfBFnX8Ja5UgwBPYHkopsHfG)\n\nThe main use of the funds will be to pay our contributors:\n\n1.  jigglyjams - $4,000/cycle (used to cover time and expense)\n2.  twodam - $5,000/cycle\n3.  nicholas - $1,500/cycle\\\n    \\===================\\\n    $10,500 (total contributors payout)\\\n    \\+ 500 (overflow to be kept in the project for operation(service) and future expenses)\\\n    \\===================\\\n    **TOTAL request $11,000/cycle**\n\nAll overflow funds ($500 per cycle) will stay in the nance juicebox project to be used at a later date for future expenses (more devs, new branding, expanded hosting requirements etc.)\n\n## Risks\n\nThe nance team may fail to do this job properly\n\n**Mitigations:**\n\n*   jigglyjams, twodam, and nicholas are very dedicated to the mission of nance: ***helping communities make decisions***\n*   the nance team of nicholas, twodam, and jigglyjams have been meeting regularly (Nancehall is every other week alternating between 1AM and 1PM UTC, [see nance discord for details](https://discord.gg/eHv5kwbgGE)) to further speed up the development process of the platform\n\n## Timeline\n\nThis proposal shall take affect in GC#52\n",

      "title": "JBP-400 - Utilise JB Twitter account for product, growth & acquisition purposes",
      "content": "## Synopsis\n\nAdd additional management of the Juicebox Twitter account to the Peel team to better leverage potential growth opportunities, and subscribe to Twitter Blue.\n\n \n\n## Motivation\n\nWith the Peel team consistently executing new JBM features, updates, and changes, we would like to accompany the frequent shipping efforts by creating and proliferating visibility content through our largest, and most underutilized channel, Twitter.\n\nThis has become increasingly important as we attempt to update and inform our users/community with the latest news and activity on the product through which the majority of members have interacted with the protocol through.\n\n \n\n## Specification\n\n1\\. Provide additional admin responsibilities of the Juicebox Twitter to team Peel to provide consistent and predictable updates on the state, updates, and features of the Juicebox.money product, along with occasional marketing tweets focused on growth/acquisition. Examples of such updates include:**\n\n1.  Upcoming features, changes or improvements:\n\n    *   \"A new and improved project page layout is coming soon to Juicebox.money. Making it easier than ever to get your project funded. Keep your eyes peeled 👀 \\[Teaser image/video]\"\n\n2.  Deployed/launched features of changes:\n\n    *   <span class=\"css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0\">\"You can now keep your project contributors up to date by sharing rich markdown updates directly to your project page on Juicebox.money. Now available to all Juicebox project owners: [Link to article to read more + image/video of feature]\"<br></span>\n\n3.  Community/user feedback and engagement\n\n    *   Poll on using 'X' feature\n\n4.  Growth/acquisition tweets:\n\n    *   \"On average, projects that add NFT rewards receive a 22% higher average contribution amount. Check out all our NFT projects \\[Link to explore w/ 'NFT' tag enabled]\"\n\n2\\. Subscribe to Twitter Blue for A$135/year to increase engagement and be prioritized in the algorithm.\n\n \n\n## Rationale\n\nThe Juicebox official Twitter account currently has 16.8K followers and has declining performance statistics (<https://socialblade.com/twitter/user/juiceboxeth)>. The current Juicebox Twitter strategy is to retweet ecosystem tweets (which would still remain in place) however tweets are known to perform better than retweets in regards to engagement and impressions, and native tweets open up the opportunity for other accounts to retweet and see the tweet increase impressions factoring in the follower count of the account that is retweeting.\n\nTwitter Blue users have seen higher engagement and impressions than non-subscribed accounts.\n\nBy introducing an additional Twitter strategy and upgrading to Twitter Blue, on top of the current re-tweeting strategy, we open up new opportunities to reach, inform and acquire new and existing users.\n\n \n\n## Risks\n\n*   Peel team may worsen the declining performance of the Twitter account\n*   The additional strategy may fail to gain traction\n*   The A$135 cost may not produce a sufficient return\n\n \n\n## Timeline\n\nEffective from FC#50 for 7 funding cycles.\n",

      "content": "## Synopsis\n\nRenew Peel’s recurring payout at US$60,000 per funding cycle (FC). Peel is the team that builds and maintains juicebox.money.\n\n## Motivation\n\nIn our last proposal, Peel presented a product roadmap for juicebox.money: <https://grand-popcorn-c81.notion.site/Product-framework-dc8da04f5b7e4197bd27ebbf5fa43e9b>.\n\nSince our last proposal, we have executed on this roadmap as planned. Here's what we've delivered:\n\n*   juicebox.money complete rebrand\n*   Redesigned homepage (+ addition website pages like /about)\n*   Account profiles (+ profile pages)\n*   Project watchlists/notifications\n*   Significant improvements to project search + project customization (tags, cover photos)\n*   Support for new NFT Rewards contracts (JB721Delegate v3.2)\n*   Significant page speed improvements site-wide\n*   Tons of smaller improvements and bug fixes\n\n## Specification\n\nContinue payouts of US$60,000 per FC to Peel (V3 project handle @peel) for 7 funding cycles.\n\n## Rationale\n\n*Why is this specification appropriate?*\n\nWe believe continuing to improve juicebox.money is crucial to the Juicebox Protocol's success.\n\nNext up on the juicebox.money roadmap:\n\n*   New project page (currently in final phases of design)\n*   Project settings overhaul\n*   Expansion of rewards (investigate digital + physical goods)\n*   Research and initial implementation into plugin/app's architecture/design (<https://grand-popcorn-c81.notion.site/Juicebox-Apps-Ecosystem-dfd59363bc894f328897e37a3b2bec54>)\n\nFor more, see <https://grand-popcorn-c81.notion.site/Product-framework-dc8da04f5b7e4197bd27ebbf5fa43e9b>.\n\nOther rationale:\n\n*   A pre-tempcheck poll to JuiceboxDAO contributors revealed that core contributors were happy for Peel to continue at the payout amount (9 votes in favor) <https://discord.com/channels/775859454780244028/1108207351686770771/1108207356455694368>\n\n## Risks\n\n*What might go wrong?*\n\n*   Peel fails to help drive value to the DAO.\n*   Peel doesn’t use funds effectively.\n*   Peel’s projects don’t meet community expectations.\n\n## Timeline\n\nThis proposal should take effect immediately. It should be removed after 7 cycles.\n\n\n---\n[Discussion Thread](https://discord.com/channels/775859454780244028/873248745771372584/1109260197823787098) | [IPFS](QmNSRVRV7G6zntShsoUQuv6Wsy3RhHEJXWTT9XNdGjB6zn)",

      "title": "JBP-397 - Sponsor T-Shirts for Water Polo Events",
      "content": "## Synopsis\n\nMCSA (<https://juicebox.money/@mcsa)> is hosting the regional Junior Olympic Qualification Water Polo Tournament on June 2-4 and June 16-18 in Northern California. For the June 2-4 there are 127 teams entered and for June 16-18 I anticipate over 100 teams as well. Traditionally, I have made shirts for the 1st-3rd place teams as an award for their placement.  Currently I place the Juicebox logo on every schedule for every event that I host.  View the Marin County Cup schedule by going [HERE](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10SSecb_pa2WlFrnK-PzVe9CcVhGCF0VPpogKFsqxhPI/edit#gid=1070730429)\n\n## Motivation\n\nI DO NOT think this will move the needle much but I do think it will create awareness and will point people to the website to at least check it out. Keep in mind that every youth water polo club is a 501(c) non profit and most are always looking to fundraise.\n\n## Specification\n\nSpecs: 11 divisions (10u-18u), 18 shirts x 3 (1st -3rd) = 594 shirts. Budget of $5 per shirt = $2970.\n\n\\*\\*I am requesting $1000 from Juicebox Dao to help offset the costs.  \\*\\*\n\nSend to <https://juicebox.money/@mcsa>\n\n \n\n## Rationale\n\nTrying to bring more awareness to the general public about Juicebox.  \n\n \n\n## Risks\n\nThere may not be an ROI that is measurable. \n\n## Timeline\n\nNext FC\n\n\n---\n[Discussion Thread](https://discord.com/channels/775859454780244028/873248745771372584/1109230898915856464) | [IPFS](QmTdo4Aumc98SHjcyn3pcjHDmTFstLyQq3Ybzies4PaFLU)",

      "title": "JBP-395 - Reduce and Renew Wagmi Studio Payout",
      "content": "## Synopsis\n\n*State what the proposal does in one sentence.*\n\nPayout to Wagmi Studios for ongoing art and promo work.\n\n## Motivation\n\n*What problem does this solve? Why now?*\n\nWagmi is coming to an end at Juicebox and for our last proposal we hope to use the next 7 cycles to create cohesiveness throughout all branches of Juicebox. We hope to achieve this through the creation of new art and illustrations, intended for pivotal touchpoints such as the Twitter banner, YouTube banner, Discord invite background, Discord image, the docs. (And possibly hand draw icons for the website like ETH symbol, twitter, tools, etc) Additionally, we aim to update the existing illustrations to align with the newly adopted color palette, such as blog illustrations, error pages, the 404 page, etc. I believe that art/illustrations can make a website stand out against competition and JB has that advantage, it’s important to lean into the juicy side of things!\n\nTo ensure the optimization of our visual assets, we plan to remove the outdated GIFs from sources like Tenor and Giffy and replaced with new updated versions in hopes to enhance their accessibility across various platforms including Twitter, Instagram, and the iPhone library (and android?) to continue to turn Banny into the meme he deserves!\n\nWe will make fresh illustrations that will serve as a valuable resource for the visibility team, and for video production to continue to have fun cover art. By compiling an extensive library of art and illustrations that fit within the new branding style, the Juicebox team will have a large selection of options to choose from, facilitating their endeavors in the future.\n\nWe feel that fostering a sense of cohesion throughout the Juicebox ecosystem is extremely important, solidifying the brand's renewed identity and trajectory. It is worth noting that the funny and weird art and illustrations linked to Juicebox play a pivotal role in attracting and captivating a vast audience. Wagmi hopes to create an expansive library of art that can be used to perpetuate the existing love for Juicebox, while also reinforcing its unique and compelling brand narrative.\n\nOnce this proposal runs out we plan to move from a recurring payout to an as-needed position since all of the major updates will be completed.\n\nWagmi also will continue to:\n\n• Work with the visibility team to create art for marketing campaigns and other forms of outreach\n\n• Collaborate with members of Peel to help with the redesign of the [Juicebox.money](http://Juicebox.money) website\n\n• Create meme worthy illustrations and characters\n\n \n\n## Specification\n\n*How exactly will this be executed? Be specific and leave no ambiguity.*\n\nRecurring payout in the amount of: $5,000/Funding Cycle\n\n\\=\n\n$5,000 Sage {Art, Illustration, Design}\n\n \n\n## Rationale\n\n*Why is this specification appropriate?*\n\nOur previous work to help justify our continued support.\n\n• New illustrations for [Juicebox.money](http://Juicebox.money) site\n\n(see examples below to see some of the new illustrations created that fit with the new branding style)\n\n• Art for blog and other parts of the JB website.\n\n• Illustrations for Merch\n\n• Worked on the visual design aspect of the locked JBX NFT project which will bring better incentives to governance and exposure to Juicebox\n\n• Using and teaching others features like Project payer address to sell NFT’s into Treasury\n\n• Created 40+ emojis and over 85+ stickers which gives life to the JB Discord\n\n• Created logo, iconic Banny and other Juicebox characters featured on the website\n\n• Creating high quality cultural assets for iconic moments in JB history and for yearly events.\n\n• Collaborating with Lexicon Devils to create a unique digital hangout/education center in Crypto Voxels for Juicebox\n\n• Educational videos to help explain the more technical features of JB\n\n• WAGMI worked on the marketing collateral and assets for the big Morgensterns Ice Cream Event. Which we hope to make art and illustrations for future collaborations!\n\n##  \n\n## Risks\n\n*What might go wrong?*\n\n*Wagmi Studios not being able to deliver on great art, digital assets, and culture fomentation*\n\n \n\n## Timeline\n\n*When exactly should this proposal take effect? When exactly should this proposal end?*\n\n*Execute for FC 50 for 7 funding cycles*\n\n \n\n**Examples of some of Wagmi's recent work:**\n\n \n\n*![](https://nance.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmU6ZNbMomC8CwRG6dueQ466X4VYWttqrS2tYiUU66DtVC)\\*\\*![](https://nance.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmV8RS82YVsCWr8dEAZY85KTZmjkLrANabHMFm4UaQHrbV)![](https://nance.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmbCz6gn5Hx1hmUTLrTfntZJqaSQpuPaUHUhRFEQsbpzj7)![](https://nance.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmWHoshH66DwCrSLj1t54DxLwNWPiq1iAceUzU8pMZPiyb)![](https://nance.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmZA1wirR4EifpC5YeBfZfsFDP9jeDRAwRyt9cNKEmAKaG)![](https://nance.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmUgZEP9YP6yC2DuTjWfbF7G6qY31YS8Hj3UgV2Aak3QZz)![](https://nance.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmU4jzPNViJbTnSWKqWf8rdQAFFyGkwQHJXGThshk7VP2D)![](https://nance.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmVcCS7kGjHLsVFU1S6xkBkWUuGCZcAzCYb6bSbrK55Ktd)![](https://nance.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmedUoNmQjRXfkhtgueCPkADEzS5p8cDRYvkeMSJEQzo2A)![](https://nance.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmRpotV6jq51d9YFdNF2Xp6nLVCGvAESSZsBF7Xgz5J2Y5)![](https://nance.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmS99g6M7Nf67hTSX4AZH3MWQbB87pJSRvreCMfkKZhFTi)*\n\n \n\n\n---\n[Discussion Thread](https://discord.com/channels/775859454780244028/873248745771372584/1109108847043424286) | [IPFS](QmP1p5YQxptUUNC2Zwc2jARMBkeh7nQyyPnLRCzSTggRFL)",

After making sure that I fully digest all the things, I would compile the gist and match with relevant context, such as links, images, screenshots, so that people who are not in the loop can understand relatively easily.\n\n    During last payout period, from Feb. 1st till May 17, I have finished 14 summaries of town halls in 7 FCs, they can be found here: <https://docs.juicebox.money/town-hall/> .\n\n2.  Chinese versions of Town Hall summaries. With the language barrier, it is not very easy for our Chinese speaking community members to join our conversation, grab information and understand more about Juicebox ecosystem and JuiceboxDAO, so I want to compile also the CN version so that they can get a routine update on what has been going on, and jump into the rabbit hole of Juicebox if they wish. The corresponding town hall cn versions are here: <https://docs.juicebox.money/zh/town-hall/> .\n\n3.  Tweets of governance activities. When every new governance cycle begins, I will edit and post a tweet in Chinese to remind the beginning of our temp check for new proposals, as well as including threaded tweets to give a concise explanation for every proposal, so that even members with language barrier can understand each proposal at a glance.\n\n    And when temp check ends and Snapshot voting begins, I will follow up with a similar tweet to give updates about discussion gists and relevant proposal changes.\n\n    This work I have been doing is out of the thoughts of lowering the participation threshold for Chinese speaking members, so that hopefully they want to get more involved into our community.\n\n    These tweets can be found in <https://twitter.com/zhape1112>, and with the help of re-tweeting from our official account <https://twitter.com/juiceboxETH>, hopefully they can reach out to people interested in Juicebox.\n\n4.  I have been diligently working on Juicebox's project on Crowdin, and constantly keeping our website fully translated. Luckily I was able to catch up with website revamp efforts by Peel, so when we officially announced a new website, there was always a Chinese version ready by the side.\n\n    ![](https://nance.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmWzR1NNp6Q7xGrH5FxAdamhWqvTHRH9qT2SbF24f4s1fF)\n\n5.  Educational videos/blog post in CN\n\n    *   A walkthrough of different stages of a Governance Cycle of JuiceboxDAO in Chinese, which can be found \\[here]\\(<https://youtu.be/A0RVHJYo_Wc)>. ![](https://nance.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmWB35steawiASnKAw2EmgUcJ8dFRj4UjmxqMcKUoR1o62)\n    *   A guide to migrate JBX V1 and V2 tokens to JBX V3 token at \\[here]\\( <https://youtu.be/lYZPzrmNEWk>)![](https://nance.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmPxXdL3XkTu85JophPjmTwmqNXesh5MWZfwpk2ZZBruwg)\n    *   A blogpost of JBX migration guide in Chinese: <https://docs.juicebox.money/zh/updates/jbx-v3-migration-guide/>, which is not a translation to our English guide, but one that I wrote after personally went throught the process twice.\n\n6.  Acted as a moderator in our Discord CN channels, sharing up-to-date information of Juicebox, answering questions of our members, coordingating their efforts to make proposals.\n\n### What I plan to do in this payout period\n\n1.  Keep working on all the above-mentioned areas.\n2.  Now we have many exciting new fronts like Bananapus, Blunt, Croptop, Fair Lunch etc., which are all very fascinating and imo might bring big changes to our ecosystem, and it also seems that we might be on track to start the discussions about JBX tokenomics in the near future, I want to explore any other way to possibly help propagate the ecosystem, the protocol and the new features/extensions, while at the same trying to encourage and support more involvement of other community memebers in our discussions and governance activities.\n\n## Risks\n\nI am not as responsible for my job, or I fail to deliver what I promised.\n\n## Timeline\n\nIf approved, this proposal will take effect from FC #49, and end after FC#55.\n\n\n---\n[Discussion Thread](https://discord.com/channels/775859454780244028/873248745771372584/1108960574928330843) | [IPFS](QmQTeTPUNAxzqjXcGwdYa3xAbXg2Cp5tc6XvbKmqxVkAUe)",

      "content": "## Synopsis\n\nReduce and renew the recurring payout for 0xBA5ED for 7 funding cycles, from $10,000 to $8,000 per funding cycle.\n\n## Motivation\n\nMy recurring payout has come to an end, this proposal will allow me to keep working full-time on Juicebox. Since my last proposal I have worked on various things. Here are some of the things I have worked on:\n\n\\- Reviewed and optimized juice-721-delegate(/NFTRewards) V3.2\\\n\\- Integrated JBOwnable into juice-721-delegate(/NFTRewards)\\\n\\- Helped with JBTerminal3\\_0\\_1 and JBTerminal3\\_1 testing and review\\\n\\- Wrote tests and simulations for V1, V1.1 and V2 deprecation\\\n\\- DefiLlama adapter for Juicebox V1, V2 and V3\\\n\\- Wrote a color library for the token resolver\n\nHere are some things that I could work on in the next 7 cycles:\\\n\\- Improve developer experience by writing a solidity library that simplifies working with the Juicebox Protocol\\\n\\- Create a multi-delegate that gives more flexibility to extensions (and allows projects to use multiple extensions at the same time)\\\n\\- Research and work on improving protocol limitations such as multi-cycle fundingcycle guarantees\\\n\\- Juicebox adapter so it can use Uniswap V3 TWAP price feeds instead of Chainlink \n\nThe above are just some things I would like to work on and I think may be useful to the DAO/Protocol. However I will focus my time on what (I feel) the DAO finds most important.\n\n## Specification\n\nFor the next 7 funding cycles pay (0xBA5ED) \\`0xb045708e396E20071324C1aed2E4CFB90A0764FE\\` $8,000 per funding cycle and keep him on the list of beneficiaries of reserved JBX.\n\n## Rationale\n\nSmart-contract developers are hard to hire because its new, niche and there is a high demand. 0xBA5ED is an experienced smart-contract developer and is comfortable with and has a good understanding of the Juicebox V3 codebase.\n\n## Risks\n\n\\- Reduced quality or less code shipped than before\\\n\\- 0xBA5ED could stop contributing\n\n## Timeline\n\nThis proposal should take effect immediately.\n\n\n---\n[Discussion Thread](https://discord.com/channels/775859454780244028/873248745771372584/1108872388499734528) | [IPFS](QmXUYkryNPpChKgSSYwUzCK9kmKv4WCCR5ybJ4KkDYQhBB)",

Send filipv 3m JBX from the multisig.\n\n## Recent Work\n\nAlthough this list is not comprehensive, some recent highlights:\n\n*   Add a [Project NFT Settings page](https://github.com/jbx-protocol/juice-interface/pull/3521) to juicebox.money, allowing project creators to customize their project NFT's theme or use a custom token URI resolver.\n*   Maintaining and improving the documentation, including its recent rebrand, new [legal resources](https://docs.juicebox.money/user/resources/legal/), [DAO resources](https://docs.juicebox.money/dao/reference/jbx/), [frontend documentation](https://docs.juicebox.money/dev/frontend/metadata/), and much more. For a full account, see [GitHub](https://github.com/jbx-protocol/juice-docs/graphs/contributors).\n*   Updated copy and terminology throughout the frontend and docs – see these commits: [1](https://github.com/jbx-protocol/juice-interface/pull/3130) [2](https://github.com/jbx-protocol/juice-interface/pull/3168).\n*   Created `juice-doc.sh`, a script which generates markdown API documentation (using `forge doc`) and organizes it for Docusaurus. With a recent rewrite, it now re-formats the documents and adds contract addresses and all relevant internal links. Creating API documentation for new repositories used to take days – now it takes \\~3 seconds.\n*   Created the [Contact page](https://juicebox.money/contact).\n*   Created the [Multisig Process](https://docs.juicebox.money/dao/multisig/).\n*   Created our current gas reimbursement system, and `juicy-reimburser`, a CLI tool to automatically build reimbursement transactions for Safe or Disperse to make the process more efficient and accurate. It also accounts for transactions to distribute payouts and reserved tokens from a Juicebox project.\n*   Worked with Jigglyjams to manage ongoing multisig operations.\n*   Added API docs for the new 3.0.1/3.1 contracts, `juice-721-delegate`, the [Delegate Registry](https://docs.juicebox.money/dev/extensions/juice-delegates-registry/), Nicholas' [NFT Token Resolver](https://docs.juicebox.money/dev/extensions/juice-token-resolver/), `juice-v3-migration`, and many other contracts and updates.\n*   Ongoing administration and maintenance of the Discord server – set up the new Heartbeat channel (with payments, Twitter mentions, and GitHub activity), the requests channel, and other updates.\n*   Manage permissions and administration of other services – GitHub, Figma, Notion, and so on.\n*   Created and maintained various analytics dashboards and queries on [Dune](https://dune.com/juicebox).\n*   Manage DAO subscription billing (Figma, Notion, Google Workspace).\n*   Educational/onboarding activities: Twitter spaces with Fringe Finance, Origami, and ThePASS, as well as onboarding calls and support for project creators of Orb Club DAO, FlipDAO, The Ibn Inglor Project, and several projects that have yet to launch. Additionally, I've helped developers get involved with JuiceboxDAO and Peel – Ethsign, Mensari, GuardianUI, and a Nounish project which is still getting started (see the `\\#auction` channel in Discord).\n\nFor more recent work, see my [GitHub](https://github.com/filipviz).\n\n## Planned Work\n\nAlong with continued contributions to the focus areas above, I plan to spend more time helping the groups building on top of Juicebox – Nance and Bananapus in particular, and others as opportunities arise.\n\n*   I expect to continue facilitating JuiceboxDAO operations and helping with other things as needed.\n*   I have been working on [tools for Bananapus](https://github.com/Bananapus/bananapus-rewards), and plan to continue creating tools to facilitate L2 operations.\n*   I plan to work on a Nounish Bidder project built with Juicebox (see the \\`#auction channel)\n*   I would like to help Nance out with API documentation at some point.\n*   I plan to continue contributing to Peel and [juicebox.money](https://juicebox.money).\n\nSome of these projects may be funded by their respective organizations at some point, but I have not submitted any proposals to them so far.\n\n## Specification/Timeline\n\nReduce recurring payout to filipv.eth to $8,400 per cycle, and extend the payout until FC#55.\n\nDistribute 3m JBX from the multisig to filipv.eth within a month of this proposal's Snapshot ratification.\n\n\n---\n[Discussion Thread](https://discord.com/channels/775859454780244028/1104101733560492052) | [IPFS](https://nance.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmT8Mi1tqBjApM4b9whdTshHgqAYBRYsL6Wx6zCpCsqvbX)",

      "content": "# Fund a Code4rena Audit of the Buyback Delegate\n\n<pre><code>author: filipv\ndate: 2023-04-04\n</code></pre>\n\n## Synopsis\n\nAllocate $35k worth of ETH to sponsor a Code4rena audit of the Buyback Delegate contract. The Buyback Delegate will route incoming payments to JuiceboxDAO's project to a Uniswap liquidity pool if doing so would result in the payer receiving more JBX than they would receive from by paying the project. Both payers and reserved rate recipients will benefit from better-priced JBX tokens.\n\nThis proposal will not ratify the deployment or usage of the Buyback Delegate – only an audit of the smart contract.\n\n## Motivation\n\nAn audit will help improve the security, efficiency, and reliability of the Buyback Delegate – JuiceboxDAO's previous Code4rena audits have been effective.\n\n## Specification\n\nWithin the next two months:\n\n1.  Multisig to swap ETH from its balance for 35,000 USDC.\n2.  Multisig to send USDC to an address provided by Code4rena.\n\n## Rationale\n\nThe multisig holds 160.04182 ETH, making it easier to use that ETH instead of pulling ETH from one of the DAO's projects.\n\n## Risks\n\n1.  Audits are not guaranteed to mitigate all risks, and this audit has a comparatively modest budget.\n2.  Token slippage – if ETH's price goes down relative to the price of USD before the multisig is able to swap ETH for USDC, the audit will be more expensive in real terms.\n3.  The DAO may decide not to use the Buyback Delegate, which would mean the contract would only be useful for other Juicebox projects. No other projects have expressed interest in using the Buyback Delegate so far.\n\n## Timeline\n\nTo be executed within two month's of this proposal's ratification on Snapshot. The Code4rena audit is slated to start on May 15, 2023 at 20:00 UTC and to end on May 18, 2023 at 20:00 UTC.\n\n\n---\n[Discussion Thread](https://discord.com/channels/775859454780244028/873248745771372584/1104090921013887077) | [IPFS](QmUSKiQBFmDBq2wJkY8PHetiLzF7hcadU4RHyH1ffDoZZT)",

      "title": "JBP-384 - Turn Off JuiceboxDAO's v1 and v2 Projects",
      "content": "## Synopsis\n\n1.  Announce that the DAO is deprecating v1/v2, and help projects migrate as needed.\n2.  Migrate [JuiceboxDAO v1](https://juicebox.money/p/juicebox) from v1 -> v1.1. This allows payments to be paused.\n3.  Set fees to 0% on v1 and v2.\n4.  Pause payments to the DAO's v1 and v2 projects.\n\n## Motivation\n\n1.  The DAO will no longer have to keep JBX issuance in sync between its v1/v2/v3 projects.\n2.  The DAO will no longer have to configure or update the v1/v2 projects.\n3.  Peel can move towards deprecating v1/v2 on [juicebox.money](https://juicebox.money). This will increase development speed.\n4.  (Possibly) – other projects such as the Juicebox Subgraph could be simplified by deprecating v1/v2.\n\n## Specification\n\n1.  Multisig to call [`TerminalV1.migrate(...)`](https://etherscan.io/address/0xd569D3CCE55b71a8a3f3C418c329A66e5f714431#writeContract#F7) with a `_projectId` of `1` and a `_to` of `0x981c8ECD009E3E84eE1fF99266BF1461a12e5c68`, the address of [`TerminalV1_1`](https://etherscan.io/address/0x981c8ECD009E3E84eE1fF99266BF1461a12e5c68).\n2.  Multisig to turn off v1 fees by calling [`TerminalV1.setFee(...)`](https://etherscan.io/address/0xd569D3CCE55b71a8a3f3C418c329A66e5f714431#writeContract#F12) with a `_fee` of `0`.\n3.  Multisig to turn off v1.1 fees by calling [`TerminalV1_1.setFee(...)`](https://etherscan.io/address/0x981c8ECD009E3E84eE1fF99266BF1461a12e5c68#writeContract#F12) with a `_fee` of `0`.\n4.  Multisig to turn off v2 fees by calling `JBETHPaymentTerminal.setFee(...)` with a `_fee` of `0` on the v2 terminal at [`0x7Ae63FBa045Fec7CaE1a75cF7Aa14183483b8397`](https://etherscan.io/address/0x7Ae63FBa045Fec7CaE1a75cF7Aa14183483b8397).\n5.  Multisig to configure a v1.1 cycle with payments paused (such that `((_fundingCycle.metadata >> 32) & 1) == 1`), an unlimited payout using the \\`V1Allocator\\`, and all other parameters as they are now.\n6.  Multisig to configure a v2 cycle with `pausePay` enabled and all other cycle parameters as they are now.\n\nThis specification should only take place as described once fork/simulation testing confirms that projects will continue to be able to use v1, v1.1, and v2 if they choose to do so. If testing reveals that this is not the case, parts of this specification may be delayed or removed, and a new proposal will be required with updated details.\n\n## Risks\n\n1.  Excluding JuiceboxDAO's project and ConstitutionDAO (which cannot pay fees, as funds can only leave the project through redemptions), v1 and v1.1 projects currently hold \\~104 ETH, which could yield \\~2.6 ETH in fees. The v2 payment terminal currently holds \\~41 ETH, which could yield \\~1 ETH in fees. The DAO will not receive that ETH, and those project creators will not receive JBX.\n2.  An alternative may be simpler: setting a maximum discount rate on v1, turning off token issuance on v2, and releasing a deprecation announcement (without actually disabling the projects).\n\n\n---\n[Discussion Thread](https://discord.com/channels/775859454780244028/873248745771372584/1104193487106211931) | [IPFS](https://nance.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmcG53AF2j7FmQJh1EJJyFqNg8UxM5bSXaJ5QzxKxtk7pk)",

      "title": "JBP-385 - Claim and Distribute some of JuiceboxDAO's $NANA and $BLUNT; Distribute Greenlight Tokens",
      "content": "## Synopsis\n\nJuiceboxDAO has 28,438,932.6187 NANA tokens from funding [Bananapus](https://juicebox.money/v2/p/488), 13,271,501.8756 BLUNT tokens from funding [Blunt](https://juicebox.money/v2/p/490), and 21,500,320 Greenlight Tokens from funding [StudioDAO](https://juicebox.money/@studiodao).\n\nThe first two projects plan to use on-chain governance, meaning JuiceboxDAO's balance will only be reflected if it claims this token.\n\nThe multisig should claim JuiceboxDAO's balance in the first two projects as ERC-20s, and evenly distribute 40% of those tokens to active contributors to allow them to participate in the governance process of these projects. The multisig should also evenly distribute 40% of its Greenlight Tokens to those contributors.\n\n## Motivation\n\nThe DAO holds significant balance in all of these projects but has no plan to utilize those tokens.\n\n## Specification\n\n1.  Multisig to call `JBTokenStore.claimFor(...)` with a `_holder` of `0xAF28bcB48C40dBC86f52D459A6562F658fc94B1e` (the multisig's address), a `_projectId` of `488` (Bananapus' project), and an \\`\\_amount\\` of \\`28438932618707937346300000\\`.\n2.  Multisig to call \\`JBTokenStore.claimFor(...)\\` with a \\`\\_holder\\` of \\`0xAF28bcB48C40dBC86f52D459A6562F658fc94B1e\\`, a \\`\\_projectId\\` of `490` (Blunt's project), and an \\`\\_amount\\` of \\`13271501875610543177900000\\`\n3.  Evenly distribute 40% of the claimed amounts between DrGorilla.eth, jango.eth, 0xba5ed.eth, filipv.eth, 0xviraz.eth, brileigh.eth, matthewbrooks.eth, zhape.eth, sagekellyn.eth, mieos.eth, 0x3C6233fA507eDfB5F58615CB11f3FEf34Dc754Ee (project owner of dao dev inc), mcsa.eth, codalabs.eth, peri.eth, squarechainlabs.eth, strathmckay.eth, timjl.eth, and johnnyd.eth.\n\nOf the \\~28,438,932 $NANA being claimed, \\~11,375,573 $NANA will be distributed in the manner above, with each address receiving \\~631,976 $NANA.\n\nOf the \\~13,271,501 $BLUNT being claimed, \\~5,308,600 $BLUNT will be distributed in the manner above, with each address receiving \\~294,922 $BLUNT.\\\nOf the \\~21,500,320 Greenlight Tokens held by the DAO, \\~8,600,128 Greenlight Tokens will be distributed in the manner above, with each address receiving \\~477784 Greenlight Tokens.\n\n## Rationale\n\nThis is a simple way to allow the JuiceboxDAO, Peel, and WAGMI Studios communities to contribute to and participate in the governance process of emerging Juicebox projects, but saves the majority of the tokens for JuiceboxDAO's future use.\n\n## Timeline\n\nTo be executed within 2 months of this proposal's Snapshot ratification.\n\n\n---\n[Discussion Thread](https://discord.com/channels/775859454780244028/873248745771372584/1104123377658122422) | [IPFS](QmYTroMZ8YjUPdyMG1dft5muoDK9d4GvJoE2mhfkRgXVBH)",

Call [`JBV3Token.migrate()`](https://etherscan.io/address/0x4554CC10898f92D45378b98D6D6c2dD54c687Fb2#writeContract#F6).\n\n## Rationale\n\n1. Allows the `JBV3Token` contract to migrate the DAO's v1 JBX.\n2. Allows the `JBV3Token` contract to migrate the DAO's v2 JBX.\n3. Allows the `JBV3Token` contract to migrate the DAO's v1 `Tickets` ERC-20 JBX.\n4. Migrates the tokens approved in steps 1-3.\n\n## Risks\n\n\nAlthough the v3 migration contracts were tested and [audited](https://hackmd.io/@berndartmueller/2023-01-juice-v3-migration), there are always risks of bugs and vulnerabilities when interacting with smart contracts.\n\n\n## Timeline\n\n\nTo be executed within 90 days of this proposal's Snapshot ratification.\n\n\n\n---\n[Discussion Thread](https://discord.com/channels/775859454780244028/873248745771372584/1096857694800990333) | [IPFS](https://nance.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmQJmfUKxSYhixxWjCrjzY7SBK7semJmwinCb521oTrbM4)",

      "content": "\n```text\nAuthor: filipv\nDate: 2023-04-15\n\n```\n\n\n## Thesis\n\n\nUpdate JuiceboxDAO's reserved token recipients on each of its projects as described below. If ratified, this proposal will supersede previous proposals related to reserved JBX.\n\n\n## Motivation\n\n\nThe DAO's reserved JBX is not accurately being sent to current contributors.\n\n\n## Summary\n\n\nContinue to reserve 30% for [dao.jbx.eth](https://etherscan.io/address/0xaf28bcb48c40dbc86f52d459a6562f658fc94b1e), and evenly split the remainder between current reserved JBX recipients, with the following modifications:\n\n- Add [timjl.eth](https://etherscan.io/address/0x960fd7cd779161cd425bd8d6cd21121c0326a079), who is now working with Peel.\n- Remove burtula.eth, as she is no longer working with WAGMI studios.\n- Remove zom-bae.eth, as she is no longer working with JuiceboxDAO.\n- Remove jmill.eth, as he is no longer working with Peel.\n- Remove 0xblaz.eth, as he is no longer working with Peel.\n- Remove gulan.eth, as he is no longer working with JuiceboxDAO.\n- Remove felixander.eth, as he is no longer working with JuiceboxDAO.\n\n## Specification\n\n\nThe multisig should queue the next cycle such that 30% of reserved JBX is sent to dao.jbx.eth, and 3.5% of reserved JBX is sent to each of the following addresses:\n\n1. 0xstvg.eth\n2. 0xviraz.eth\n3. aeolian.eth\n4. brileigh.eth\n5. drgorilla.eth\n6. filipv.eth\n7. jango.eth\n8. jb.0xba5ed.eth\n9. jb.daodevinc.eth\n10. jigglyjams.eth\n11. johnnyd.eth\n12. matthewbrooks.eth\n13. mieos.eth\n14. peri.eth\n15. sagekellyn.eth\n16. strathmckay.eth\n17. timjl.eth\n18. twodam.eth\n19. wraeth.eth\n20. zhape.eth\n\n## Risks\n\n\nThis proposal follows established patterns, but significantly changing the reserved rate or the distribution of reserved tokens might lead to a more effective outcome.\n\n\nThe DAO will continue to reserve a large chunk of JBX for its own reserves, despite not having successfully utilized most of that JBX so far.\n\n\nThis is the third time creating a proposal along these lines. Re-proposing something until it passes is not a healthy practice.\n\n\n\n---\n[Discussion Thread](https://discord.com/channels/775859454780244028/873248745771372584/1096858452992720966) | [IPFS](https://nance.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmbZKMawKrKgccC7VLkvkmVoFk7pyiichJggftziSAu3JV)",

All funds are being returned, and once these transfers take place, ETH/JBX balances will be similar (see **Rationale**) to what they would have been if the mistakes never took place.\n\n\n## Motivation\n\n1. These discrepancies are currently unresolved, potentially reducing confidence in the DAO.\n2. While returning funds to JuiceboxDAO, WAGMI Studios sent 2.18181 ETH to the multisig instead of returning it to the [@juicebox](https://juicebox.money/) project.

      "title": "JBP-368 - $75,000 to Bananapus for over 40% of experiment.",
      "content": "**Synopsis**\n\nInvest $75,000 in the initial cycle of the Bananapus juicebox. Bananapus is an offshoot community from JuiceboxDAO's contract devs to experiment with more high-risk token ops that could make Juicebox projects harder to kill and easier to grow. Its main focus is trying to implement a particular integrative solution to cross-chain Juicebox-based organizations, onchain governance based on staked positions, and token distribution strategies.\n\n \n\n**Motivation**\n\nThe next big problems JuiceboxDAO needs to solve are:\\\n\\\n1\\) replacing multisig ownership with a great onchain governance UX.\\\n2\\) becoming accessible on L2 EVMs.\\\n3\\) distributing JBX in a manor which incentivizes network propagation.\\\n\\\nThese are all high risk for JBX to experiment directly with. JuiceboxDAO has spent the better part of its past year's budget on risk management -- contract dev, testing, versioning, fixing, UX for it all. See [here.](https://jango.eth.limo/31469E9F-8C0D-49E9-8003-0077674708A6/) In an effort to cut down on risk management expenses going forward, the DAO should instead fund and take part in another community that'll attempt to implement solutions to these delicate needs. Bananapus will take on those risks and capitalize on opportunities that may come from being a first mover, with the thesis that these needs might be best solved in a single mechanism that can be shipped in scoped chunks. JuiceboxDAO can later adopt what it likes into JBX if proven safe and useful.\\\n\\\nBananapus will be initially governed onchain through the NANA ERC-20 token and a Governor contract. It will then:\\\n\\\n1\\. build a Juicebox treasury that uses a NANA payment terminal, issuing artful NFT gov tokens as the 721Delegate-like NANA-denominated tiers -- essentially staking and unstaking: ERC-20 paid in, NFT minted out. NFT redeemed, ERC-20 reclaimed -- and move to NFT governance. See [here](https://jango.eth.limo/277497FC-E946-4685-A812-B0C0DC0962C1/) for ideas of how this concept may be exposed to users in web clients.\\\n\\\n2\\. create a component that distributes a reserved rate allocation (or any inbound coin) to be claimable by holders of a subset of 721Delegate-like tier holders. These claimed rewards can be vested, and fortified if the recipient unstakes before a certain future date.\\\n\\\n3\\. use these components together to create a way for project token stakers on L1 to not only receive distributions from other L1 projects, but also those of projects running on L2 instances of the Juicebox protocol, and vice versa. There are a few implementation ideas in discussion.\\\n\\\nThese are all high risk and somewhat pie-in-the-sky, but I think they can work. Each component can be of generalizable high use for projects.\\\n\\\nI think JuiceboxDAO should be steady in how it relates with this experiment: \\\n\\\n1\\. invest initially because the people involved -- jango, drgorilla, 0xba5ed, viraz, hopefully others soon -- have proven trustworthy and the treasury design is aligned with JBX interests. In other words, scoop some NANA and consider participating in Bananapus governance of its juicebox. Fund development inso doing. Invest more over time if it's working.\\\n\\\n2\\. acknowledge that Bananapus has potential to be a DAO that manages a meaningful responsibility if it figures out how to effectively deploy the Juicebox protocol on other EVMs. Acknowledge that this may not reflect directly on JBX unless JBX continues being a useful community to create a vibrant ecosystem, in which case NANA will always have incentive and desire to route NANA to be claimed by JBX stakers, else it'll be forked and outcompeted. \\\n\\\n3\\. most likely Bananapus will find some issue along the way and spend too much time debugging or re-architecting, in which case JuiceboxDAO might not want to continue committing its resources to this particular experiment. Now that the protocol's versioning seems steady, it makes sense to reduce ongoing payouts to developers who attempt to build solutions to the next big problems directly onto JBX, and instead fund offshoots that offload most risk for others to take.\n\n4\\. If Bananapus succeeds in proving out its thesis, JBX can choose to either a) continue aligning with NANA and promote its growth, or b) fork the playbook and compete with NANA directly. \n\nThe Bananapus treasury will run in 6 week funding cycles, with 0 payouts, 0 discount rate, 100% redemption rate, a 7-day ballot, and a 30% reserved rate => 10% to bananapus.eth (the onchain Governor), and 20% to dao.jbx.eth. We will try to get to a point where these reserved chunks can soon be claimable directly by NANA and JBX stakers. The treasury will issue 1m NANA / ETH.\n\nOur goal will be to deploy on an L2 with a 1st Cycle synced with mainnet Bananapus's 2nd Cycle in 6 weeks time. The syncing isn’t necessary, but it makes operations cognitively simpler for governing token holders.\n\nBananapus's 1st L2 Cycle will be similar: synced 6 week cycles. 0 payouts, 0 discount rate, 100% redemption rate, 7-day ballot, 30% reserved => 10% to the L2 Bananapus Governor, 10% to L1 Bananapus Governor, and 10% to ecosystem DAOs of the L2 being used. The treasury will issue 1m opNANA\\[polyNANA,zkNANA] / ETH. It will use a 5% protocol fee. These numbers are all subject to change.\n\nOur goal by the end of mainnet Cycle 2 will be to have moved governance from the NANA ERC-20 to staked NANA NFTs using a new 721StakingDelegate component that's very similar to the now-familiar 721TieredDelegate.\\\n\\\nBananapus will be highly experimental and will have no guarantees. \\\n\\\nI'm also excited for Bananapus to build collaborations with Peel, Nance and WAGMI once we get some bits of tooling off the ground. \n\n \n\n**Specification**\n\nSend $75,000 of ETH to the Bananapus treasury, to be deployed by Saturday, April 15 2023. This will mint NANA for JuiceboxDAO both as a financial contributor and reserved rate recipient.\n\nGive JuiceboxDAO the power to exercise redemption of its NANA at any time without a new proposal if and only if there is a proposal to NANA governance that proposes a payout from the Bananapus treasury that suggests a takeover. The redemption value of JuiceboxDAO’s NANA should be higher than its initial $75k investment if this is the case. See below for the math.\\\n\\\nAlso send 20 million JBX to bananapus.eth if JuiceboxDAO ever chooses to adopt a NANA-based component for JBX.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\\n\\[Math]\\\n\\\nAssuming 30% reserved rate, with 20% going to dao.jbx.eth, 1m NANA / ETH issuance rate, 50% governance quorum.\\\n\\\n**action 1:**\\\n\\~40 ETH paid by dao.jbx.eth => 40m NANA issued, 28m NANA to dao.jbx.eth, 12m reserved which includes 8m to dao.jbx.eth.\\\n\\\n**resulting state 1:**\\\ndao.jbx.eth now has 36m NANA of a total 40m NANA.\\\n\\\n**action 2:**Imagine an exploiter (exploit.eth) trying to capture the Bananapus treasury by going after over 50% of tokens.\\\nX ETH paid by exploit.eth => Xm NANA issued, 0.7Xm NANA to exploit.eth, 0.3Xm reserved which includes 0.2Xm to dao.jbx.eth. Where X guarantees 50.01% of circulating NANA to exploit.eth.\\\n\\\n**resulting state 2:**\\\nTotal NANA supply of (40+X)m.\\\ndao.jbx.eth now has (36+0.2X)m NANA.\\\nexploit.eth now has 0.7Xm NANA. Set Y = 0.7Xm.\\\n\\\nsolve for Y, where Y = 50.01% of (40+X)m:\\\nY = 0.5001(40 + X)m\\\nY = 20.004m + 0.5001Xm\\\n\\\nreplace Y and solve for X:\\\n0.7Xm = 20.004m + 0.5001Xm\\\n0.7X = 20.004 + 0.5001X\\\n0.1999X = 20.004\\\nX = \\~100.07\\\n\\\nGiven the treasuries new balance of 140.07 ETH and a 100% redemption rate, dao.jbx.eth could redeem its 56.014m NANA out of total 140.07m NANA (\\~40%) for 56 ETH.\n\nA 7 day reconfiguration delay would give the DAO 7 days to execute this retrieval of funds before the NANA treasury can be rugged.\n\n \n\n**Rationale**\n\nEasy and transparent.\n\n \n\n**Risks**\n\nBananapus will likely not work. At most the DAO is risking $75,000 of ETH.\n\n \n\n**Timeline**\n\nNext funding cycle\n\n\n---\n[Discussion Thread](https://discord.com/channels/775859454780244028/873248745771372584/1093979487688994996) | [IPFS](https://nance.infura-ipfs.io/QmZ4cnEJLPUou5xXeisGSqQ24iTPFVdtL2mvmuAHbMsae9)",

Deploy a project with a funding goal, an optional funding cap, and an optional deadline.\\\n2\\. People can contribute to your project, and get refunds at any time until the goal is reached. \\\n3\\. If the goal is not reached, the project dissolves and funders can access their funds.\\\n\\\nIf the project does succeed, its ownership is passed on to an address specified when the project was deployed, who can then create new cycles for it.\\\n\\\nThis is modeled using Juicebox funding cycles with a custom project owner, pay delegate, and redeem delegate.\\\n\\\nWe also added a community growth model. For successful projects, a membership fee is taken into the Blunt juicebox treasury, which issues BLUNT tokens back out to the project owner. The fee is 3.5% if the raise is less than $100k, and linearly decreases to 1.5% as the raise approaches $20M.\\\n\\\n\\*\\*Blunt's treasury \\*\\*\\\n\\\n0 Payouts\\\n0 Discount rate\\\n100% Redemptions\\\n30 days cycles with 3-day delay\\\n\\\n1m BLUNT / ETH\\\n30% Reserved\\*\\*\\\n-> 12% to the Blunt Governor\\\n9% to M2E (jacopo)  \\\n6% to JBDAO\\\n3% to Peel\\\n\\\nThere also been a premint of 30,000,000 BLUNT for jacopo, and 10,000,000 BLUNT for Jango.\\\n\\\n**BLUNT Governor**\\\n\\\n66% quorum\\\n7 day voting delay, meaning voting for a proposal starts 7 days after it has been submitted.\\\n7 day voting period, meaning proposals have 7 days to reach quorum from the day voting starts.\n\n \n\n## Specification\n\n*Send $35k worth of ETH to the Blunt project, which will be created by Saturday April 15, 2023.*\n\n \n\n## Rationale\n\n*Easy and transparent*\n\n \n\n## Risks\n\n*Blunt will likely not work.*\n\n \n\n## Timeline\n\n*Next cycle*\n\n\n---\n[Discussion Thread](https://discord.com/channels/775859454780244028/873248745771372584/1093979488456544306) | [IPFS](https://nance.infura-ipfs.io/QmPAXtiEwaRZ9AKHjWdcWbhsknhGeNHjeVvDFYChbS46QC)",

      "title": "JBP-370 - $12k recurring Jango payout through Breadfruit",
      "content": "**Synopsis**\n\nAllocate $12,000 per Cycle to Breadfruit (ID 470), operated by Jango, for continued protocol risk management work. This includes contributions to documentation, advising both hired and freelance auditors and integrators who are digging into the protocol’s specs, and being on-call to help lead the DAO through any protocol emergencies.\n\nIn this renewal, Jango's payout is being reduced from current $21k / cycle, as is his intent to develop new contracts for JuiceboxDAO. The gameplan is to continue manage current risk instead of opening up new pockets of unscoped risk as JuiceboxDAO.\n\n**Motivation**\n\nJuiceboxDAO has now finished \\[its versioning efforts]\\(<https://jango.eth.limo/31469E9F-8C0D-49E9-8003-0077674708A6/>). There are no known bugs the DAO is actively working to fix, or core features the DAO is actively working to build. I believe the DAO’s core purpose is now to continue increasing the likelihood of the protocol’s safety and stability for integrators and users.\\\n\\\nI plan on continuing helping the DAO with this risk mitigation work by:\n\n1.  contributing to documentation intended to clearly, accurate, and accessibly reflect how the protocol works.\n\n    1.  clarify current juicebox protocol architecture and how information can be accessed.\n    2.  write more documentation on how certain extensions can be leveraged.\n    3.  document already-existing extensions to provide examples that others can follow.\n    4.  contribute to more boiler plate starter packs for extension developers.\n    5.  help prototype how LLMs might help curious users and devs traverse the juicebox protocol documentation.\n\n2.   advising both hired and freelance auditors and integrators by the DAO to review protocol components over time.\n\n    1.  help clients integrate the protocol’s functionality safely, and advise towards UXs that reduce risk and flex capability.\n    2.  help auditors traverse the protocol’s user journeys to discover undocumented behaviors.\n    3.  help protocol extension developers as they’re specifying and implementing functionality.\n\n3.  being on-call to help lead the DAO through any protocol emergencies.\n\n    1.  it’s safer to assume that something unexpected is likely to happen, which might require timely attention from people with a wide understanding of how Juicebox protocol and JuiceboxDAO works.\n\n         \n\n**Specification**\n\n1.  *Send *$12,000* of ETH to Breadfruit (ID 470) for 8 Cycles. Breadfruit will serve as an independent contractor to JuiceboxDAO.*\n2.  *2m JBX to breadfruit.eth upfront.*\n3.  *Change the reserved token allocation current going to jango.eth to breadfruit.eth.*\n\n**Rationale**\n\n*Easy and transparent.*\n\n**Risks**\n\n*Breadfruit is operated by Jango, a fragile human being that could go poof.*\n\n**Timeline**\n\n*Next funding cycle*\n\n\n---\n[Discussion Thread](https://discord.com/channels/775859454780244028/873248745771372584/1093979489056333887) | [IPFS](https://nance.infura-ipfs.io/QmTgccagNTrz6UZ5DAP55zCmigkNrfqS4s6KercuA9wfy1)",

      "title": "JBP-364 - Reoccuring payout for nance project",
      "content": "## Synopsis\n\nFund the nance Juicebox project $11,000 per funding cycle for 7 cycles (total $77,000)\n\n## Motivation\n\nOver the past few months twodam, jigglyjams, and nicholas have been collaborating and built the following features:\n\n1.  **Proposal content search** - this is major improvement and was not possible using notion (only titles could be searched)\n2.  **Proposal editing on jbdao.org** - editing proposals on jbdao.org ensures that the original author is the only one that can edit (as they must sign a message on submission)\n3.  **IPFS image hosting for proposal uploads** - when you paste an image here in the proposal editor, it is pinned to ipfs (using <https://nft.storage>), this is another major improvement over notion as the images will show up properly when the proposal is pushed to snapshot\n4.  **Auto push to dolt** - dolt provides git like functionality for mySQL databases, this allows us to roll back the database if there are ever any technical issues, a github action is used to query for new proposals and push to dolthub in the event there is a new proposal (<https://www.dolthub.com/repositories/jigglyjams/juicebox>)\n5.  **Better proposal stats** - (mostly done by twodam) the beautiful main proposal page now features stats on how many unique addresses have voted on a proposal\\\n    ![](https://bafkreiczmdpwbei7vbsrdizyev4ngcg3mtttsi3mkslsna4rzmggqd3pji.ipfs.nftstorage.link/)\n6.  **API endpoint to create a nance instance** - this endpoint creates a new database and nance config file for an organization, still need to develop the frontend to properly interact with it\n7.  **Tenderly simulation submission** - this sends all reconfigureFundingCyclesOf transactions to a Tenderly fork and advances time by 6 days to ensure that configurations can be properly distributed, this helps mitigate silly reconfiguration bugs (developed in collaboration with Dr.Gorilla.eth, thanks fren)\n8.  **Reconfiguration helper** - this has become an essential part of the multisig reconfiguration process by showing the different project updates in a user friendly way, this replies on the nance-api to retrieve the recurring payouts submitting through proposals ([https://www.jbdao.org/juicebox](/juicebox))\n9.  **Discord transaction threads** - this feature saves us a lot of time by automatically showing in Discord any new payouts or payouts that have been removed from the next funding cycle\\\n    ![](https://bafkreigjjkhavs2wqoxcpjd6momjmmjh7mrqws4raae4aj4eoegq4qm6li.ipfs.nftstorage.link/)\n10. **Discord bookkeeping** - this shows all payouts for an upcoming governance cycle along with how many payouts have been sent for a given proposal\\\n    ![](https://bafkreica3du3gkecld3trxkrwisxl3mqknw5ibetaiifg7ewpoazvci35m.ipfs.nftstorage.link/)\n\nThere are some new features that we have in the pipeline that we are excited to build:\n\n1.  **Attaching \"actions\" to a proposal** - this will allow a proposal author to add actions to perform on the passing of a proposal (see mockup below), this will help ease efforts from the multisig whom normally has to hunt down the author to find out exactly what they wanted to perform after the fact\\\n    ![](https://bafkreib5zbtoomfvchfffxom4ky5h6optf7zmp4obythitstlpwtqfuqay.ipfs.nftstorage.link/)\n2.  **Further improve proposal metrics** - add average voter turnout and voter turnout per funding cycle (simple mockup below), this will allow the DAO to understand how many voting members are coming out for each governance cycle and begin ot understand what causes more DAO engagment\\\n    ![](https://bafkreidbyrkrjyqdgxjm2k5awmvtuzoa55gaatesb4wnwnlhi4ftr6pxza.ipfs.nftstorage.link/)\n3.  **Create nance instance UI** - in order to spread nance to more DAOs, we need a simple UI to create a nance instance, the API endpoint ot setup the database is there, we need to tie it together with a tight UI that makes it easy for anyone to test out using nance\n4.  **Explore different funding options** - finding a governance business model is hard when there are so many good free things out there, nicholas has some awesome ideas on how to keep nance an open source, publically funded good; gitcoin, optimism, or other large DAOs have the potential to keep us paying our devs\n5.  **Integrate accounting** - there is a lot to explore in the bookkeeping and accounting world still, we are very interested in integrating accounting tools with nance so DAOs can have a one click export of all of their JB and multisig transactions\n6.  **Public Read/Write for dolt** - this will move nance to a true decentralized database\n7.  **Documentation and about page** - this is necessary in order to explain nance to outsiders and apply for new grants (this will also help with explaining how to self host a nance instance)\n8.  **Improve forkability** - refactor nance-auto, nance-api, and jbdao.org frontend to be easily forkable for other organizations, extract hooks (snapshot, juicebox)\n9.  **Improve mobile site** - make jbdao.org more mobile friendly\n\n## Specification\n\nThe nance juicebox project will be own by a 2/3 multisig with jigglyjams, twodam, and nicholas as the signers.\n\nExpenses to operate nance are quite low **(\\~$100/month)**:\\\n![](https://bafkreigtkham3nj72mm5g4uu4fqxdrrknidf4tonim6obpevvf33pupnzu.ipfs.nftstorage.link/)\n\nThe main use of the funds will be to pay our contributors:\n\n1.  jigglyjams - $4,000/cycle (used to cover time and expense)\n2.  twodam - $5,000/cycle\n3.  nicholas - $1,500/cycle\\\n    \\===================\\\n    $10,500 (total contributors payout)\\\n    \\+ 500 (overflow to be kept in the project)\\\n    \\===================\\\n    **TOTAL request $11,000/cycle**\n\ntwodam's recurring payout from [JBP-323](/p/323) shall be cancelled once the $5,000 is properly configured to be received from the nance juicebox project\n\nAll remaining funds will stay in the nance juicebox project to be used at a later date to pay devs.\n\nBy the end of these cycles all proposals shall be submitted through jbdao.org or some custom frontend, **notion shall no longer be used**. This will ensure that nance works well enough to provide the service that it set out to build.\n\n*Note: the nance juicebox project will be setup before the end of voting and the payout shall be directed to that project once it is setup*\n\n## Risks\n\nThe nance team may fail to do this job properly\n\n**Mitigations:**\n\n*   jigglyjams has been heavily involved over the past 9 months and very much enjoys this work and being apart of JB\n*   the nance team of nicholas, twodam, and jigglyjams have been meeting regularly to further speed up the development process of the platform\n\n## Timeline\n\nThis proposal shall take affect in GC#45\n\n\n---\n[Discussion Thread](https://discord.com/channels/775859454780244028/873248745771372584/1088928832209309697) | [IPFS](https://bafkreicpn5ql6pgaumhp7vtdaes2czkpc2noaelfcgqobby5pbc2phw6ny.ipfs.nftstorage.link)",

      "content": "\n```text\nAuthor:jusdao.eth\nDate: (2023-3-23)\n```\n\n\n## Synopsis\n\n\nAllocate grants to support the development of Juicebox Chinese community. 拨款支持 Juicebox 中文社区的发展。\n\n\n## Motivation\n\n\nMany young people do not know that they can use the infrastructure of web3 to start their own business. Since October last year, the Hong Kong SAR government has supported the development of the Web3 ecosystem, and there is a compliant policy environment there.The Garage Web3 project holds workshops and provides training so that young people can learn to use Web3 tools such as DAO, NFT, TOKEN, and DeFi. 很多年輕人不知道可以利用web3的基礎設施開啟創業之路，去年十月以來，香港特區政府支持發展 Web3 生態圈，在當地有合規的政策環境。車庫Web3項目舉辦Workshop，提供培訓，讓年輕人學會使用DAO、NFT、TOKEN、DeFi等Web3工具。\n\n\nPaid from the treasury 1k USD equivalent of ETH to the project treasury of The Garage Web3 DAO ([https://juicebox.money/v2/p/462](https://juicebox.money/v2/p/462)).从 金库支付 1000美元等值的 ETH 到 車庫web3 DAO 项目金库（[https://juicebox.money/v2/p/462](https://juicebox.money/v2/p/462))。\n\n\n## Specification\n\n- Build a list of speakers, supervised by community votes, to avoid reputational risks.建立講演者列表，由社區投票進行監督，避免聲譽風險\n- A workshop is held in each financing cycle, with about 25 participants in each session.每一個融資週期舉辦一次workshop，參加人數25人左右。\n- Incubation and curation of CN projects. We might be holding some launchathon, and select the winners by voting in the categories of influence, numbers of members, contribution received, etc; 中文项目的孵化及展示。我们会考虑举办一些项目创建大赛，通过投票的方式在影响力、成员人数及筹款金库等方面选出优胜者；\n\n## Rationale\n\n\nThe vision is to build the project into a self-sustaining one in the Juicebox ecosystem, instead of always asking for support from JBDAO. So, the main focus will be how to get some revenue and ultimately stand on its own 这个项目的展望是要把自身打造成一个 Juicebox 生态内自给自足的一个项目，不计划长期需要 JBDAO 的支持。因为，主要的关注点在于如何获得一些收入来最终能成形成自力更生的一个项目。\n\n\n## Risks\n\n\nThere might be poor management.  We need to recruit some folks good at those categories along the way. 可能会有管理不善的风险。我们需要在发展的过程中招揽一些精于这些范畴的人。\n\n\n## Timeline\n\n\nTo be executed in the FC#45, if this proposal is approved. 如果提案通过，则在 #45  周期执行。\n\n\n\n---\n[Discussion Thread](https://discord.com/channels/775859454780244028/873248745771372584/1088315720888229918) | [IPFS](https://bafkreidjqpi766c3qcvjxkpze7e5m2s2yczsdtituzs67bdo6pu6xqkuwq.ipfs.nftstorage.link)",

      "content": "\n```javascript\nAuthor: wraeth\nDate: 2023-03-01\n```\n\n\n## Thesis\n\n\nSet the official [**Juicebox Logo**](https://jbm.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmehKhWy8VatMY1hDXPuMzEKFS8jvgBwJT1ofxwDAyZaxo) as the logo of the [**dao.jbx.eth**](https://app.ens.domains/name/dao.jbx.eth/details) ENS.\n\n\n## **Background**\n\n\nJuicebox.money (**JBM**) has recently released a feature that prominently displays Ethereum Naming Service (**ENS**) icons on its site. As dao.jbx.eth is the primary ENS for the Juicebox project, I believe that it would be beneficial to use the official Juicebox logo for this ENS. Not only would this increase the trust of the official Juicebox transactions, but it would also improve the user experience on the site. Additionally, it would encourage other users to interact and use their own custom ENS icons, and eventually profile icons (a future JBM feature).\n\n\n## **Proposal**\n\n\nI propose that the logo of dao.jbx.eth be updated to the official Juicebox logo. This will require updating the image associated with the ENS domain. The new logo will be more recognizable and will help to increase the visibility of the Juicebox project.\n\n**This proposal states that the multisig will upload the new logo before the end of April (before May 1st), otherwise the proposal expries and a new proposal will be required for submission.**\n\n**ENS**: [**dao.jbx.eth**](https://app.ens.domains/name/dao.jbx.eth/details)\n\n\n**Logo image**: [**https://jbm.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmehKhWy8VatMY1hDXPuMzEKFS8jvgBwJT1ofxwDAyZaxo**](https://jbm.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmehKhWy8VatMY1hDXPuMzEKFS8jvgBwJT1ofxwDAyZaxo)\n\n\n![](https://jbm.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmehKhWy8VatMY1hDXPuMzEKFS8jvgBwJT1ofxwDAyZaxo)\n\n\n## **Benefits**\n\n- Increased trust in the visual elements of the ENS\n- Improved user experience on the Juicebox site\n- Encourages users to interact and use custom ENS icons\n- Increases visibility of the Juicebox project\n\n## **TLDR**\n\n\nBy updating the logo of dao.jbx.eth to the official Juicebox logo, we will be able to improve the user experience and increase the visibility of the Juicebox project.\n\n\n\n---\n[Discussion Thread](https://discord.com/channels/775859454780244028/873248745771372584/1081366022826754189) | [IPFS](https://bafkreifiwfjpxsj3hb7pm2g7erkhrlzcrs6mores5izrdlyrn6xrkrar6u.ipfs.nftstorage.link)",

      "content": "\n```text\nAuthor: filipv\nDate: 2023-03-02\n```\n\n\n## Thesis\n\n\nAuthorize the multisig to reimburse Ethereum gas fees for deploying Juicebox contracts, distributing JuiceboxDAO payouts, and distributing reserved JBX.\n\n\n## Motivation\n\n\nDeploying contracts is expensive, but writing individual reimbursement proposals takes time and attention. By putting a reasonable reimbursement process in place, the DAO can give contract devs more confidence when deploying contracts.\n\n\nAs the DAO migrates operations to its v3 treasury, it should offer payout distribution reimbursements to ensure that the v1 allocator payouts described in [JBP-316](https://www.jbdao.org/p/316) take place.\n\n\nThese reimbursements should help to make DAO operations smoother.\n\n\n## Specification\n\n\nWithin each 30-day period, allow the multisig to reimburse up to 10 ETH for deploying Juicebox contracts, and 1 ETH for distributing JuiceboxDAO payouts or distributing reserved JBX.\n\n\nThese amounts are to be distributed at the multisig's discretion, and are not guaranteed to individuals deploying Juicebox-related contracts or distributing funds/tokens. Multisig signers should exercise their best judgement when queuing, signing, or executing reimbursement transactions.\n\n\nFor any larger reimbursements, a proposal will still be required.\n\n\n## Rationale\n\n\nReimbursements will most likely be far below these amounts, but setting these thresholds gives the multisig some leeway to deal with unexpected events.\n\n\n## Risks\n\n- This proposal follows the trend of giving more power and responsibility to the multisig, which can go wrong. We should automate this with [`juice-opengsn`](https://github.com/jbx-protocol/juice-opengsn) as soon as possible.\n- Contract deployers might be less careful if they think that refunds are guaranteed.\n\n## Timeline\n\n\nApprove these reimbursements for 180 days from the time this proposal is ratified on Snapshot.\n\n\n\n---\n[Discussion Thread](https://discord.com/channels/775859454780244028/873248745771372584/1081366022986149899) | [IPFS](https://bafkreieth57z3jqnka56jmmiry2sue5rflbdenaljzdkcutv7szyzuitza.ipfs.nftstorage.link)",

      "content": "<pre>Author: Nicholas<br>Date: 2022-03-10</pre><h2>Synopsis</h2><p>Extend the multisig&rsquo;s permission to set the TokenUriResolver till theend of April 2023.</p><h2>Motivation</h2><p>The TokenUriResolver gives metadata to JB Projects. After significant <a href=\"https://github.com/jbx-protocol/juice-token-resolver/pull/1\">review and improvement</a> from the contract crew, the v1 token resolver is finally <a href=\"https://testnets.opensea.io/collection/juicebox-projects-4q1ka34blj?search[sortAscending]=false&amp;search[sortBy]=CREATED_DATE\">working on testnet</a> and ready to ship. This proposal will extend the permission the DAO gave the multisig to set and change the TokenUriResolver in <a href=\"p/321\">JBP-321.</a></p><h2>Specification</h2><p>Grant the multisig permission to set and change the tokenUriResolver. Nicholas, Jango, DrGorilla, Ba5ed, and Viraz will communicate with the multisig to update the tokenUriResolver until the end of the specified term as they deem necessary.&nbsp;</p><p>Transfer ownership of the TokenUriResolver contract to a 3/5 multisig (eth:0xcDC51dBC9bF8Dac4A6882a937B1BDbB25cF04E1C) composed of Nicholas, Jango, DrGorilla, Ba5ed, and Viraz, to deploy iterative upgrades to the DefaultTokenUriResolver &ndash; which provides the default metadata to projects that do not set custom resolvers &ndash; until the end of June 2023. As owner of this contract, the multisig will only be able to update the default resolver with richer visuals, metadata, and theme customization.&nbsp;</p><h2>Rationale</h2><p>Finalizing the v1 of the token resolver has taken longer than anticipated and was deprioritized several times as it does not directly generate revenue or adoption of JB. Nevertheless, in the past few weeks a flurry of dev activity has led to 1) a version of the contracts that we are ready to launch, and 2) <a href=\"https://github.com/jbx-protocol/juice-svg-template\">several</a> <a href=\"https://github.com/xBA5ED/solcolor\">ancilliary</a> <a href=\"https://github.com/nnnnicholas/juicebox-1155\">contracts</a> that will support further onchain token metadata development.&nbsp;</p><p>This proposal extends the multisigs permission to set the TokenUriResolver &ndash; a permission which has not been used thus far &ndash; so that this element of the protocol can be brought to fruition. It also grants a new multisig composed of the contract crew an extended time limit to update the default renderer, because there are several improvements that can be made to the default metadata without changing the core TokenUriResolver contract.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2>Risks</h2><p>The tokenUriResolver could be used to deploy bad metadata that is deceptive or underwhelming. In the extreme worst case, the tokenUriResolver could enable malicious wallet interaction in unsafe NFT metadata browsers &mdash; though OpenSea and other major marketplaces have protections in place to remove this threat vector.</p><p>The default resolver could be changed to something unanticipated. This risk is mitigated by the fact thath the main token resolver can always be changed by the primary JBDAO multisig.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Note: The tokenUriResolver is a low stakes parameter of the protocol.&nbsp;Granting open ended permission to the multisig to update it poses no major threat to the security or usability of the protocol, and gives JBDAO&rsquo;s devs the opportunity to improve the tokenUriResolver contract iteratively.</p><h2>Timeline</h2><p>Grant open ended permission to the multisig to update the tokenUriResolver, as directed by the above devs, until the end of April 2023.</p><p>Give ownership of the token resolver to the multisig eth:0xcDC51dBC9bF8Dac4A6882a937B1BDbB25cF04E1C for them to update the default resolver until the end of June 2023. Ownership may then be passed back to the JBDAO multisig, or the owner may be set to 0x0000 as the contract crew sees fit.&nbsp;</p>'\n\n---\n[Discussion Thread](https://discord.com/channels/775859454780244028/873248745771372584/1083901761577816135) | [IPFS](https://bafkreid7den2nnzmry76uct3gixq5rr2pxiftoztlzfs3ovhclmy3nxsvm.ipfs.nftstorage.link)",

      "content": "\nStatus: Draft\n\n\n```text\nAuthor: aeolian\nDate: (2023-02-24)\n```\n\n\n## Synopsis\n\n\nRenew Peel’s recurring payout at US$60,000 per funding cycle (FC). Peel is the team that builds and maintains juicebox.money.\n\n\n## Motivation\n\n\nJuicebox is at a crossroads. With JuiceboxDAO’s limited runway, it is imperative that funds are allocated to people and projects that are taking clear steps to making JuiceboxDAO a sustainable organization.\n\n\nPeel is on a mission to connect 1,000,000 creators to 100,000,000 backers to contribute $1,000,000,000.\n\n\nThe Peel team has proven its ability to execute (Appendix 1). We now endeavor to take it to the next level by focusing on a single goal: **driving revenue to JuiceboxDAO**.\n\n\nWe outline our product strategy and vision for Juicebox in [https://grand-popcorn-c81.notion.site/Product-framework-dc8da04f5b7e4197bd27ebbf5fa43e9b](https://grand-popcorn-c81.notion.site/Product-framework-dc8da04f5b7e4197bd27ebbf5fa43e9b).\n\n\nOur strategy **was not** formulated on a whim. It has emerged after many user interviews, focused workshops and discussions with you, the JB community.\n\n\nHigh-level goals:\n\n1. Evolving the Juicebox brand into an attractive, trustworthy and desirable brand.\n2. Creating brand alignment with a clearly branded ecosystem of products.\n3. Expansion of JBM functionality into new funding verticals to capture new markets/opportunities.\n4. Introduction of management tools to increase product engagement and value post-fundraising/launching.\n5. Introduction of product marketing channels such as email to onboard, education and re-engage users.\n\nFor a complete roadmap on how we get there, see [https://grand-popcorn-c81.notion.site/Product-framework-dc8da04f5b7e4197bd27ebbf5fa43e9b](https://grand-popcorn-c81.notion.site/Product-framework-dc8da04f5b7e4197bd27ebbf5fa43e9b).\n\n\nSome [juicebox.money](http://juicebox.money) features that are included in the roadmap:\n\n- Enhanced project discovery: e.g. search, project tags, project recommendations\n- Account profiles: your JB hub ([MVP live now](https://juicebox.money/account/jango.eth))\n- Project watchlists: get notified about project activity via email\n- Project update notifications: projects can share updates and announcements with their community.\n- Revamping of Project Settings: 10x usability\n\nSuccess is not guaranteed. But failing to plan is planning to fail. We are asking for the JB community’s support to give us the best chance at helping JB succeed.\n\n\n## Specification\n\n\nContinue payouts of US$60,000 per FC to Peel (V3 project handle @peel) for 12 funding cycles.\n\n\n## Rationale\n\n\nA US$60,000 payout is unchanged from our last proposal.\n\n\nHere is a breakdown of how we are currently using these funds.\nFTE = Full-time equivalent; IC = individual contributor; DRI = directly responsible individual\nOur current capacity is as follows (see Juicebox funding distribution):\n\n- 1 lead/DRI @ $14,000 per FC\n- 5 FTE ICs @ $9000 per FC\n\nBeyond this, Peel must budget for infrastructure including but not limited to Infura, Vercel, TheGraph, Tenderly, Heroku, and Fathom Analytics.\n\n\n## Risks\n\n- Peel fails to help drive value to the DAO.\n- Peel doesn’t use funds effectively.\n- Peel’s projects don’t meet community expectations.\n- Peel fails to communicate development progress and product updates.\n\t- Note: Peel is committing to giving more regular product updates in JB Townhall, the JB Discord, as well as broader announcements (with help of the Visibility team)\n\n## Timeline\n\n\nThis proposal should take effect in FC 44 (should be executed during FC 43)\nPeel should be removed from recurring payouts from FC 51 (after 7 cycles).\n\n\n## Appendix\n\n\n### 1. Evidence of execution \n\n\nSince our last payout, we’ve been in bolt-tightening mode, while also adding select new features along the way.\n\n- Provided 24/7 support to project creators and JB community.\n- Immediately prioritized contract-crew needs, to integrate new contract features and support new versions of JB contracts.\n- Continued enhancements to core functionality:\n\t- Project creation iterations.\n\t- NFT rewards enhancements (multi-selection, videos).\n\t- Safe page for multisig-owned projects.\n- Overhauled much of our infrastructure and code base in order to provide value to users quicker and more reliably long-term.\n\t- Provided end-to-end upgrade support for V1 and V2 projects.\n\n### 2. Peel projects\n\n\nPeel commits to owning and maintaining the following projects:\n\n- juicebox.money and goerli.juicebox.money.\n- The Juicebox Subgraph, on TheGraph.\n\nOther future Juicebox-related projects that require Peel’s involvement should be considered in a separate payout proposal.\n\n\n### 3.

      "content": "\n```text\nAuthor:mieos\nDate: (2023-01-29)\n```\n\n\n## Synopsis\n\n\n_State what the proposal does in one sentence._\n\n\nPayout to Wagmi Studios for ongoing art and promo work. \n\n\n## Motivation\n\n\n_What problem does this solve? Why now?_ \n\n\nJuicebox is in its last 10 months of runway and we really need better marketing and visibility in order to increase this runway. Wagmi wants to shift direction and start helping out with marketing and visibility through art/illustrations/infographics really any way to help elevate existing projects such as the youtube channel, the podcast, the blog and the website itself. WHY NOW? Up till now, marketing and vis were less valued by the DAO, We were the let other successful projects do JB’s marking. But now that the bear market is fully upon us we are feel the DAO’s shift to marking. \n\nJuiceboxes new NFT rewards is a huge new product that need successful use cases that help build project creators intuition about how they might leverage the new Juicebox tool. WAGMI is working on delivering a few killer concepts that bring people into JB and end up using the Rewards to participate through the sale of classic banny sticker and emojis \n\n\nWagmi also will continue to:\n\n\n• Work with the visibility team to create art for marketing campaigns and other forms of outreach\n\n\n• Help members of the JB ecosystem with art/illustrations ex: Juicecast new artwork and future NFT’s for the Juicecast podcast \n\n\n• Collaborate with members of Peel to help redesign the [Juicebox.money](http://Juicebox.money) landing page/ hero section. \n\n\n• Collaborate with Merch squad to come up with cool designs to continue to promote juicebox through stickers, clothing and other goods.\n\n\n## Specification\n\n\n_How exactly will this be executed? Be specific and leave no ambiguity._ \n\n\nRecurring payout in the amount of: $6,500/Funding Cycle\n\n\n=\n\n\n$5000 Sage {Art, Illustration, Design, UI}\n\n\n$1000 Mieos {Art, Art Direction/Curation, Communications, Connect of dots, Pusher-man}\n\n\n$500 to WAGMI Treasury to pay for gas to publish NFT’s to promote the NFT rewards and get more Banny’s into the world\n\n\n## Rationale\n\n\n_Why is this specification appropriate?_\n\n\nOur previous work to help justify our continued support. \n\n\n• Art for blog and other parts of the JB website.\n\n\n• Worked on the visual design aspect of the locked JBX NFT project which will bring better incentives to governance and exposure to Juicebox \n\n\n• Using and teaching others features like Project payer address to sell NFT’s into Treasury\n\n\n• Created 40+ emojis and over 85+ stickers which gives life to the JB Discord\n\n\n• Created logo, iconic Banny and other Juicebox characters featured on the website\n\n\n• Creating high quality cultural assets for iconic moments in JB history and for yearly events.\n\n\n• Collaborating with Lexicon Devils to create a unique digital hangout/education center in Crypto Voxels for Juicebox\n\n\n• Educational videos to help explain the more technical features of JB\n\n\n• WAGMI worked on the marketing collateral and assets for the big Morgensterns Ice Cream Event. Which we hope to make art and illustrations for future collaborations! \n\n\n• Working on JuiceBox NFT Martketplace. [https://bleeding-edge.juicebox.wtf/user](https://bleeding-edge.juicebox.wtf/user)\n\n\n We collaborated with Jango, Tankbottoms, NatashaPankina, Viraz, Mr. Goldstein and others to create a Locked JBX voting NFT that will be beautifully unique in all of web3. \n\n\n## Risks\n\n\n_Wagmi Studios not being able to deliver on great art, digital assets, and culture fomentation_ \n\n\n## Timeline\n\n\n_When exactly should this proposal take effect?

      "title": "349 - Ratify the Multisig Process",
      "content": "\n```text\nAuthor: filipv\nDate: 2023-02-23\n\n```\n\n\n## Synopsis\n\n\nRatify the proposed [Multisig Process](https://docs.juicebox.money/dao/multisig/) (full text below).\n\n\n## Motivation\n\n\nThe Multisig recently made several mistakes. By agreeing upon a consistent process for implementing proposals, we can reduce the likelihood that this will happen again.\n\n\nFor additional context, read the [current multisig process](https://www.jbdao.org/p/98).\n\n\n## Specification\n\n1. Ratify the proposed [Multisig Process](https://docs.juicebox.money/dao/multisig/).\n2. Revoke [JBP - 98 Ratify Multisig Process](https://juicetool.xyz/snapshot/jbdao.eth/proposal/0xaff54a1eebc16329758c925ff0fbbeb73718a0d06918609b1e8bbbf9c7cada68), [JBP-237 - Gas multisig reimbursements](https://juicetool.xyz/snapshot/jbdao.eth/proposal/0x39525013b3da5a95c47d8e3301f36c70c3dc25e1c304f63421a602b6c2f31db6), and [JBP-236 - Juicebox Subscription Reimbursements](https://juicetool.xyz/snapshot/jbdao.eth/proposal/0x70a706e6149aa8041fbb6f1cc820c7532b23ba289dff9e33f32fb207cc2d1736).\n\n## Rationale\n\n\nThe new Multisig Process does away with the need for the proposals which are being revoked.\n\n\n## Risks\n\n- People may use the process to justify something it wasn't intended to do.\n- There may be oversights within the process.\n\n## Timeline\n\n\nTo be implemented immediately upon this proposal's Snapshot ratification.\n\n\n---\n\n\n---\n\n\n# JuiceboxDAO Multisig Process\n\n\nThe JuiceboxDAO Multisig, [`0xAF28bcB48C40dBC86f52D459A6562F658fc94B1e`](https://etherscan.io/address/0xAF28bcB48C40dBC86f52D459A6562F658fc94B1e), is responsible for interpreting and executing the outcomes of the [Governance Process](https://docs.juicebox.money/dao/process/).\n\n\n## Rules\n\n1. Multisig signers must agree to execute the will of JBX token holders, as expressed through the Governance Process.\n2. The Multisig threshold must be at or above 60% of signers at all times.\n3. The Multisig can reimburse gas fees paid to execute previous Multisig transactions.\n4. In an emergency, the Multisig can execute transactions according to the [Juicebox Emergency Procedures](https://docs.juicebox.money/dao/security/emergency/).\n\n## Process\n\n\nDuring Offchain Snapshot voting, the Multisig should internally decide which signer(s) will be responsible for queuing project reconfigurations and any other necessary transactions. The Multisig should also designate a backup signer in the event that the first signer is unable to fulfill the following steps.\n\n\nLess than 12 hours after Snapshot voting finalizes, the designated signer(s) should queue all necessary transactions, create a Discord thread for each transaction, and then notify other Multisig members by tagging the `@Multisig` role. Each thread should contain a link to the relevant proposal(s), a transaction simulation, and a plain-language description of the proposed changes. If appropriate, the thread should also contain a link to a Juicetool configuration diff or other resources.\n\n\nOver the following 12 hours, each signer should independently verify and sign the proposed transactions. If a signer finds errors in or is unsure about a proposed transaction, that signer should voice their concerns in the appropriate Discord thread, tagging the signer which queued that transaction. Those signers should then work together to queue transactions which resolve those concerns (in the same manner as described above).\n\n\nThe last signer to approve the queued transactions (thereby meeting the threshold) should also execute or batch execute those transactions after approving them. If the queued transactions have still not been executed within 24 hours of the next reconfiguration delay cutoff, the designated signer should execute them.\n\n\n\n---\n[Discussion Thread](https://discord.com/channels/775859454780244028/873248745771372584/1078287770293899284) | [IPFS](https://bafkreiabdtopfcj3f766c6bmwicnfq4haworwwys36pfckzvbznfgg4zq4.ipfs.nftstorage.link)",

The proposal specified that $20,000 would be paid to dao-lawfirm up front, and that $20,000 would be paid to dao-lawfirm upon the delivery of the tasks laid out in the proposal. tankbottoms contributes to dao-lawfirm and was working on these tasks.\n\n\ndao-lawfirm delivered a terms of service and several draft opinion letters, but never completed the remaining deliverables. 10 months have passed and the DAO has not received further updates as to the status of this work.\n\n\nAdditionally, tankbottoms has been accused of fraud by his collaborators at MovementDAO, another organization he works with. He also has not been in contact with JuiceboxDAO since December of 2022. Although we don’t have a complete picture, it seems safer to revoke DAO approval for any further legal spending with dao-lawfirm — at least until we get further clarification.\n\n\n\n---\n[Discussion Thread](https://discord.com/channels/775859454780244028/873248745771372584/1076504060850618398) | [IPFS](https://bafkreidhycb45tvgn4kmpkfemt3lf2za3zawwvkwbekx6245ykaw544hau.ipfs.nftstorage.link)",

      "content": "\n```text\nAuthor: Lexicon Devils DAO\nDate: (2023-01-27)\n```\n\n\n## Synopsis\n\n\nRenew Lexicon Devils recurring payout to continue to run Forming, create Juicebox promotional content including JB inspired art, NFTs, vox models, music, as well as manage and maintain the Voxels JBX HQ parcel.\n\n\n## Motivation\n\n\nFORMING is a virtual concert series ran by Lexicon Devils hosting web3 centric musicians and showcasing how Juicebox protocol can be utilized to host events by transparently paying out artists as well as contributors. Twitter interaction and event attendance has doubled over the past couple months and we plan to continue this momentum by fine tuning the hype machine that is Forming. The following steps are listed under specification that have been taken that have helped this increase in visibility.\n\n\n**FORMING GC40**\n\n- Doubled engagement through socials with events centering native crypto communities such as Allstarz, Songcamp, LEP, & Voxels ([*example deck](https://docsend.com/view/9a4bdpw3mbw9tyar)* of what partnerships may look like)\n\n[Juicebox Learning Center Stats](https://www.voxels.com/parcels/6182/stats)\n\n\n\nhttps://ibb.co/Nnn9hYY\n\n\n[Juicebox Transit Center Stats](https://www.voxels.com/parcels/6188/stats)\n\n\n\nhttps://ibb.co/S3nbrF2\n\n- Funds raised through NFT sales using Juicebox as the mechanism by which it’s all possible\n- Launched FORMING mixtapes, editing shows into a listenable only mix and streamable from Soundcloud\n- Stood up cross-channel promotion from Youtube, Soundcloud and Twitter, to generate more attention to Forming + Juicebox\n\n**FORMING GC42**\n\n- Three, 4 Week Twitter Campaigns centered around the monthly concert series FORMING in direction collaboration with partnered communities & projects\n- Utilizing JBV3 NFT Rewards, Event/Artist specific NFTs for each collaboration with collectible appeal are revealed pre-show to incentivize performers to promote & profit from the upside of distributing the event widely\n- Community Specific Voxel Installations & complimenting Wearables\n- RSVP / Join mailing list on website to be white listed for wearable airdrop\n\n## Specification\n\n\n$8350 USD into the Lexicon Devils Juicebox every two weeks. Posted below is text and a graphic showing this funding breakdown:\n\n\n15.8% ($1319) - Germs - Vox Model / Treasury\n\n\n15.8% ($1319) - Wacko - Vox Architect / Visionary\n\n\n15.8% ($1319) - Darby - Host / Graphic Design\n\n\n15.8% ($1319) Xtine - 3D Design / Filming + Editing\n\n\n7.9% ($659) Terminalman - Web Design / Developer\n\n\n8.9% ($745) -  Lexicon Devils Treasury (reserve for production costs, Forming fund, etc.)\n\n\n20% ($1670) - deposited into the Forming Juicebox for artist payout.\n\n\n## Rationale\n\n\nHaving a dedicated fund going towards the arts and sponsoring cultural events strengthens the ties between artists & engineers, deepening the creative talent pool of not only the Juicebox ecosystem but Ethereum at large. Juicebox is a prime example of a DAO who sets the cultural tone, and is in touch with the current zeitgeist of crypto & DAOs. It’s a natural next step for the Lexicon Devils & Juicebox partnership to continue leading the scene in making creative spaces online for artists & engineers, a cultural schilling point for a new era of the internet.\n\n\n## Risks\n\n\nLexicon Devils and FORMING audience fail to understand or adopt JBX. Bear market fud too dominant and crypto skepticism too great; creating an uphill battle that makes expanding our outreach almost impossible. This would result in failure to provide impactful marketing creating greater Juicebox awareness, stagnant turn outs, and minimal directly measurable benefit to Juicebox protocol.\n\n\n## Timeline\n\n\nThis proposal should take effect immediately and last six funding cycles, starting in GC41 and ending at GC47.\n\n\n\n---\n[Discussion Thread](https://discord.com/channels/775859454780244028/873248745771372584/1071219197025206363) | [IPFS](https://bafkreib6glgmfvzzguk6nuwgcepupmphjpks5awkjj6wwkunsmzzqsm4y4.ipfs.nftstorage.link)",

      "content": "\n```text\nAuthor: 0xBA5ED.ETH\nDate: 2023-02-10\n```\n\n\n## Synopsis\n\n\nRenew and the recurring payout for 0xBA5ED for 7 funding cycles_._\n\n\n## Motivation\n\n\nMy recurring payout has come to an end, this proposal will allow me to keep working full-time on Juicebox. Since my last proposal I have worked on various things, I will highlight the two largest ones that have not had any previous explainers into what they do and what issue they solve. \n\n\n### [OpenGSN](https://opengsn.org/) integration ([Github](https://github.com/jbx-protocol/juice-opengsn))\n\n\nThis gives projects the ability to pay for transactions, for JBDAO this can be used to further automate governance by automatically distributing funds each FC and executing multisig transactions once enough signatures have been collected. This way we no longer need to do reimbursements. ([Discussion with jigglyjams on integration with nance](https://discord.com/channels/775859454780244028/1067584825407569993))\n\n\nThere are however many more ways this can be utilized, such as having a project pay the gas fees for on-chain governance, paying for gas when a user pays the project a certain amount of ERC20 etc. (there are some more ideas on Github). \n\n\nThese contracts are nearly ready, they need some more tests and need to be reviewed. Then we just need to wait for the OpenGSN team to finalize their contracts and signal that they are ready for production (as their contracts are currently in a final beta stage). I will be giving a demo of this next town hall.\n\n\n### JBOwnable ([Github](https://github.com/jbx-protocol/juice-ownable))\n\n\nRight now external contracts (such as NFTRewards) are owned by an address, usually this address is the same as the owner of the project. But if the owner of the project changes for whatever reason, the external contracts still belong to the old owner. The old owner would need to figure out all contracts they need to transfer ownership of, and transfer them to the new owner. \n\nWith JBOwnable we still keep all the old functionality but we add the option to give ownership of a contract to a project instead of to a static address. The address that owns the project also owns all contracts that are part of that project. So if the project ever gets transferred to a new owner, all JBOwnable contracts will follow automatically. \n\n\nThis contract is currently being reviewed and should be ready for production soon.\n\n\n**Some of the other things I have worked on are:**\n\n- JB721Delegate (NFTRewards) ([Github](https://github.com/jbx-protocol/juice-721-delegate/commits?author=xBA5ED))\n- JBV3Migration ([PR #4](https://github.com/jbx-protocol/juice-v3-migration/pull/4)) ([PR #10](https://github.com/jbx-protocol/juice-v3-migration/pull/10))\n- Git Bytecode Verifier ([Github](https://github.com/xBA5ED/git-bytecode-verifier)) ([Discord](https://discord.com/channels/775859454780244028/1062234601688412261/1072979050269773826))\n- Code reviews for contract-crew\n\n## Specification\n\n\nFor the next 7 funding cycles pay (0xBA5ED) `0xb045708e396E20071324C1aed2E4CFB90A0764FE` $10,000 per funding cycle and keep him on the list of beneficiaries of reserved JBX.\n\n\n## Rationale\n\n\nSmart-contract developers are hard to hire because its new, niche and there is a high demand. 0xBA5ED is an experienced smart-contract developer and is comfortable with and has a good understanding of the Juicebox V3 codebase.\n\n\n## Risks\n\n- Reduced quality or less code shipped than before\n- 0xBA5ED could stop contributing\n\n## Timeline\n\n\nProposal will take effect immediately\n\n\n\n---\n[Discussion Thread](https://discord.com/channels/775859454780244028/873248745771372584/1073644941244366938) | [IPFS](https://bafkreictn4xam52vrdd3ehqlpv4qieygmfcbqcrtalzt4kjb4w7shjp7ey.ipfs.nftstorage.link)",

      "content": "\n```text\nAuthor: zhape.eth\nDate: (2023-02-09)\n```\n\n\n## Synopsis\n\n\nto renew the recurring payout and reserved token beneficiary for zhape.eth.\n\n\n## Motivation\n\n\nzhape.eth hopes to continue contributing to JuiceboxDAO in the respects of community alignment, translation and visibility etc.\n\n\n## Specification\n\n\npay zhape.eth US$2,000 in equivalent of ETH each funding cycle for 7 FCs.\n\n\n## Rationale\n\n\n### What I have done in the last payout period:\n\n1. Town hall summaries. I have been compiling summaries for town halls of JuiceboxDAO every week, trying to give more backgrounds or contexts for the topics on these meetings so that someone curious might easily have some ideas what’s happening in our community in the past week. I think in some sense the development of Juicebox can also be revealed to the outside world in a chronicle way.\n\n\tI have made 14 summaries in the past 7 funding cycles from Nov. 1st, 2022 till Jan. 31, 2023, and here is where they can be found:  [https://info.juicebox.money/town-hall/](https://info.juicebox.money/town-hall/)\n\n2. Chinese versions of town hall summaries. I have been trying to relay the essential information to our Chinese speaking community members, same as the English versions. This is where they can be found: [https://info.juicebox.money/zh/town-hall/](https://info.juicebox.money/zh/town-hall/)\n3. Continue working on [https://crowdin.com/project/juicebox-interface](https://crowdin.com/project/juicebox-interface) to help translate the Chinese version of JBM in a timely manner.\n\n\t![](https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/377699e7-5e81-48e5-aa68-6f940b5901ca/Untitled.png?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Content-Sha256=UNSIGNED-PAYLOAD&X-Amz-Credential=AKIAT73L2G45EIPT3X45%2F20230214%2Fus-west-2%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20230214T000039Z&X-Amz-Expires=3600&X-Amz-Signature=d019b019b42b7f4bd0419c4a0eef11c87c32f6a446117376095edb6be208ee4a&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&x-id=GetObject)\n\n4. Used my personal twitter account ([**https://twitter.com/zhape1112**](https://twitter.com/zhape1112)) to help spread some information about Juicebox ecosystem.\n\t- When a new governance cycle starts, prepare concise summaries of ongoing proposals in Chinese, and notify different stages of governance (temperature check, Snapshot voting), so that Chinese speaking members can get the gist of these proposals and hopefully join our governance.\n\t- Shared some projects that might be interesting to other community members or outsiders, such as ConstitutionDAO2, Defifa World Cup, Defifa NFL Playoffs, etc.\n\t- Shared some blog posts and town hall CN summaries, in a hope to attract more interest from the outside world.\n5. Tried to make 2 tutorial videos on about how to create a project ([https://youtu.be/oNLYDGmWcSU](https://youtu.be/oNLYDGmWcSU))and make some followup setting([https://youtu.be/DvUeWS_zzG8](https://youtu.be/DvUeWS_zzG8)) on Juicebox in Chinese.\n6. Acted as mod in Chinese channels, answered questions and share the going-ons in the ecosystem with our cn speaking members.\n7. Did some other translations of blog posts and posted them to corresponding Chinese pages.\n\n\t![](https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/65d81a0d-cf64-4302-9838-7a1e64d92ff5/Untitled.png?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Content-Sha256=UNSIGNED-PAYLOAD&X-Amz-Credential=AKIAT73L2G45EIPT3X45%2F20230214%2Fus-west-2%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20230214T000041Z&X-Amz-Expires=3600&X-Amz-Signature=0b39dcf288d213de8f2ae40ccf21d767bf9addec4bbd4887423492267ff9cca7&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&x-id=GetObject)\n\n\n### What I plan to do in the next payout period\n\n1. Carry on with pretty much of all the above-mentioned work, unless some of them are deemed not as necessary in the future.\n2. I want to spend more time to learn and improve my ability in contents creation, such as video tutorials, short videos, articles and etc.  Though I think relaying information in a timely manner will also be important, I am hoping I can create some of my own contents that can be of value to our community and ecosystem.\n3. I created a JBXCN project in a hope to get some grants from JuiceboxDAO to help fund some aspects of development in Chinese specific areas/regions. This project has been temporarily put on hold completely due to my lack of in-depth high level planning in these efforts. I want to keep trying planning and experimenting, hopefully with kind helps extended from other DAO contributors or members, as I will definitely ask for help and support in this effort that only can be accomplished with team work.\n\n## Risks\n\n\nI am not as responsible for my job, or I fail to deliver what I promised.\n\n\n## Timeline\n\n\nIf approved, this proposal will take effect from FC #42, and end after FC#48.\n\n\n\n---\n[Discussion Thread](https://discord.com/channels/775859454780244028/873248745771372584/1073103266868633670) | [IPFS](https://bafkreibpbir2qdgj5zuygipufaloyvzlzzjix6q3oatahofnuv27d43kf4.ipfs.nftstorage.link)",

      "title": "JBP-341 - Finish versioning migration",
      "content": "\n```text\nAuthor: jango & filipv\nDate: 2023-02-06\n```\n\n\n## Proposal\n\n\nAfter migrating to Controller3.0.1 to patch the original bug described in this postmortem, JuiceboxDAO should now complete its migration to Terminal3.1 and Controller3.1 in order to permanently fix all known risks and inefficiencies. \n\nThe DAO should also send a special transaction to distribute FC#11 payouts to make up for a bug that surfaced from the migration to Controller3.0.1.\n\nLastly, the DAO should permit projects to be made and registered in the Directory through the new JBController3.1.\n\n\n## Motivation\n\n\nThe Controller migration to 3.0.1 patched the reserved rate bug outlined in the postmortem, while still keeping old interfaces for backward compatibility to Terminal 3.0. This allowed the DAO to fix the reserved rate bug was quickly. JuiceboxDAO should now use the best contracts available while offering them to new projects. \n\n\n### JBController3.1 migration\n\n\nChanges how reserved tokens are stored and accounted to remove a class of potential user bugs that can occur when reconfiguring a funding cycle from one reserved rate to another. It removes backward compatibility with JBController, which JBETHPaymentTerminal3.0 requires out of the project’s controller.\n\n\n### JBETHPaymentTerminal3.1 migration\n\n\nIs resilient to payment failures between projects. When one project pays another during a transaction to distribute funds, funds will be returned to the original project’s treasury if the payee’s payments are paused or if there’s a bug in their pay extensions.\n\n\nThe 3.1 terminal also has a new affordance for adding to a project’s balance bypassing the refunding of held fees, and allows calls to `distributePayoutsOf` and `useAllowanceOf` to pass in metadata to log in events.\n\n\n### Payout distribution bug patch\n\n\nThe original migration from Controller 3.0 to 3.0.1 also caused a reset to the DAO’s distribution limit for Funding Cycle #11. This proposal recommends sending a special one-time batched transaction to distribute the funds by first swapping back to the old 3.0 controller where the FC#11 distribution limit was specified, then distributing the available funds, then swapping back to the patch Controller 3.0.1. This is a one-time transaction and should be done before the migration to Controller 3.1. \n\n\n### Setting controller privilege\n\n\nJBController3.1 was created and deployed in order to make reserved issuance more robust, and specifically to solve [an issue with v3 JBX migration](https://info.juicebox.money/updates/v3-jbx-postmortem/). JuiceboxDAO migrated to this controller as part of [JBP-335](https://juicetool.xyz/snapshot/jbdao.eth/proposal/0x5b11df589ac1c3bfd40bce63351099e0223d12a1aaf5bd9439a5ba61bb302437), but new projects cannot be deployed with the updated JBController unless it is added to a list of trusted controllers, which can be done by calling [`setIsAllowedToSetFirstController`](https://info.juicebox.money/dev/api/contracts/jbdirectory/write/setisallowedtosetfirstcontroller/). \n\n\n## Specification\n\n- Step 1: The multisig should call [`setIsAllowedToSetFirstController`](https://info.juicebox.money/dev/api/contracts/jbdirectory/write/setisallowedtosetfirstcontroller/) in JBDirectory ([`0x65572FB928b46f9aDB7cfe5A4c41226F636161ea`](https://etherscan.io/address/0x65572FB928b46f9aDB7cfe5A4c41226F636161ea)) with the forthcoming JBController3.1. Await contract address confirmation from drgorilla, jango, 0xba5ed, and viraz. This allows new projects to be created and registered in the directory using the new controller.\n- Step 2: Within Funding Cycle #11, the multisig should batch call special distribution functions to 1) swap back to the old 3.0 controller where the FC#11 distribution limit was specified using `setControllerOf` in the Directory, 2) distribute the available funds from the Terminal3.0 that JuiceboxDAO currently uses, then 3) swap back to the patch controller 3.0.1 using `setControllerOf` in the Directory. This is in order to fulfill the distribution of the cycle #11.\n- Step 3: Queue Funding Cycle #12 on JBController3.0.1 (JBDAO’s current controller) to have `allowControllerMigration` and `allowTerminalMigrations` flags set to true.\n- Step 4: Within Funding Cycle #12 after distribution of payouts, the multisig should migrate to JBETHTerminal3.1 and JBController3.1 using the convenience wrapper Operator _befor_e submitting a subsequent cycle rule revisions for Funding Cycle #13, which should be made on JBController3.1. Await Operator contract address confirmation from drgorilla, jango, 0xba5ed, and viraz. This will get JuiceboxDAO on the up-to-date terminal and controller. Neither JBController3.1 or JBETHPaymentTerminal3.1 are backwards compatible. They must be upgraded together, otherwise some functionality will not work until the other is also upgraded.\n- Step 5: On JBETHPaymentTerminal3.0, set JBETHPaymentTerminal3.1 as feeless by calling `setFeelessAddress`. This allows payouts from one terminal to the other as project pay each other without incurring fees. Also, on JBETHPaymentTerminal3.1, set JBETHPaymentTerminal3.0 as feeless.\n\n## Timeline\n\n\nSee the specification.\n\n\n\n---\n[Discussion Thread](https://discord.com/channels/775859454780244028/873248745771372584/1072257970085302292) | [IPFS](https://bafkreifenrgaz5wtlgx6soef3k4raeztrqtqiyla74lup74l2ct6tnqgbe.ipfs.nftstorage.link)",

      "content": "\nStatus: Draft\n\n\n```text\nAuthor: Matthew, Brileigh\nDate: (2023-01-27)\n```\n\n\n## Synopsis\n\n\nRenew Matthew and Brileigh’s recurring payout for seven (7) funding cycles to continue producing The Juicecast, educational materials for project creators, and Juicenews.\n\n\n## Motivation\n\n\nJuicebox needs compelling, practical, and on-brand materials to attract new project creators, improve understanding of the protocol, and ultimately drive adoption. Juicebox faces the same problem as Pied Piper from HBO’s Silicon Valley: the team built a powerful tool with huge potential for mainstream adoption yet most of the public struggled to understand how and why they should use it. An effective way forward for Juicebox is to create pragmatic resources for end-users: step-by-step tutorials, use case videos, conversations with successful projects, and consistent ecosystem updates.\n\n\n## Recent work\n\n\n📰 **Ecosystem Updates**\n\n\n[Juicenews](https://juicenews.beehiiv.com/) is a weekly newsletter capturing all of the latest developments in the Juicebox ecosystem including recent podcast and blog articles, protocol updates, tutorials and guides, governance recaps, and town hall summaries.\n\n- e.g. [Juicenews for January 24th, 2023](https://juicenews.beehiiv.com/p/juicenews-jan-24-2023)\n\n📚 **Educational Content and Docs**\n\n\nWe have recently begun producing tutorials and step-by-step guides to help project creators better understand the protocol and easily build and maintain their projects.\n\n- How to Sell NFTs on Juicebox on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pgpK3LofDSU) and [Docs](https://info.juicebox.money/blog/how-to-sell-nfts/)\n- How to Migrate a Juicebox Project From V1/V2-V3 on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=az6Xu8_UsH8&t=9s) and [Docs](https://info.juicebox.money/blog/v3-migration/)\n- How to set a Juicebox project handle using an ENS address on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6YuVL7Yoxgw) and [Docs](https://info.juicebox.money/blog/set-ens/)\n- How to receive Juicebox donations at a .eth address on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k31kISgsoO0) ([article by Nicholas](https://info.juicebox.money/blog/juicebox-donate-with-ens/))\n\n![](https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/a1ba27e2-746e-4eae-b0c4-d3db55df0a7c/cover-img.png?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Content-Sha256=UNSIGNED-PAYLOAD&X-Amz-Credential=AKIAT73L2G45EIPT3X45%2F20230131%2Fus-west-2%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20230131T000709Z&X-Amz-Expires=3600&X-Amz-Signature=d65d5ec9f9eaee0c9907a8715f1d73659a02e490b0d5787e790c5a62b69e21f4&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&x-id=GetObject)\n\n\n[https://youtu.be/pgpK3LofDSU](https://youtu.be/pgpK3LofDSU)\n\n\nWe have also created articles about successful projects as case studies of what can be built on Juicebox.

Upcoming work\n\n\n🎙️ We’ll continue co-hosting and producing [The Juicecast](https://anchor.fm/thejuicecast) as a storytelling vehicle for projects and communities built on the protocol. We’ll also handle production tasks for NFT Tokenomics Office Hours with Nicholas and Jango.\n\n\n📚 We’ll continue making essential tutorials and step-by-step guides for project creators, and will also begin producing use case videos to help build JB mental models. Here are a few videos and guides in the pipeline:\n\n- How to reconfigure your project on Juicebox\n- How to offer refunds for your Juicebox project\n- Project Create Flow (short 3-5min videos on each step of the project creation flow on [juicebox.money](http://juicebox.money))\n- Juicebox for x (e.g. JB for content creators, JB for open-source software, JB for non-profits, etc.)\n\n📝 We’ll work together with Filip to improve the Project Creator docs experience and implement the following changes:\n\n- Migrate tutorials and project highlight/config articles from the Blog to the Project Creator docs\n- Integrate video tutorial links into the Project Creator docs and implement some visual improvements for a friendlier experience\n\n👀 We’ll increase our content distribution to improve searchability:\n\n- cross-post tutorials, project highlights, and config articles to Medium\n- cross-post Juicecast episodes to [Mirror.xyz](http://Mirror.xyz)\n- launch Juicecast project with NFTs by Sage (in progress)\n\n📰 In addition to continuing to release Juicenews on a weekly basis, we will work with Filip to begin [posting protocol updates as Discord announcements](https://discord.com/channels/775859454780244028/1065343529838182511/1065343698583429202) to keep community members informed and up-to-date.\n\n\n## Specification\n\n\nAdd $3000 USD recurring payout from FC41 to FC47 to matthewbrooks.eth from the v3 treasury\n\n\nAdd $3000 USD recurring payout from FC41 to FC47 to brileigh.eth from the v3 treasury\n\n\n*Please note that this payout will be routed to a Juicecast project once NFT assets are finalized in collaboration with Sage. Once ready, Matthew and/or Brileigh will inform the bookkeeper to transfer this payout to the Juicecast project instead of the addresses listed above.\n\n\n## Rationale\n\n\nWe are proposing to renew our existing payout to reflect the continued workload and output that we have established over the last seven funding cycles. We are converging on more effective and pragmatic strategies and are asking for JBDAO’s support to continue bringing greater visibility to the Juicebox ecosystem.\n\n\n## Risks\n\n\nMatthew might lose his streak in the gm channel in JBDAO Discord (currently 311).\n\n\n## Timeline\n\n\nThis proposal should take effect immediately and last seven funding cycles, starting in FC41 and ending in FC47 (inclusive).\n\n\n\n---\n[Discussion Thread](https://discord.com/channels/775859454780244028/873248745771372584/1068673950965579807) | [IPFS](https://bafkreihwhp5d3jqfhhq4bif45ncv2cuzdhct2mj6wti323ssc4vt3dd724.ipfs.nftstorage.link)",

Created the [Emergency Procedures](https://info.juicebox.money/dao/security/emergency/), [Contributor Opsec Guide](https://info.juicebox.money/dao/security/opsec/), and the [Services List](https://info.juicebox.money/dao/security/services/), as well as a GPG encryption video tutorial for DAO contributors.\n2. When all project pages went down due to an Infura issue, I set up a new Infura gateway and helped to monitor + mitigate. Also got refunds! Peri also set up a third gateway.\n3. When a bookkeeping issue could have led to contributors not receiving payouts, created several proposals ([1](https://juicebox.notion.site/Reallocate-ETH-From-v1-v3-Cover-v2-Expenses-4b9056d44d7b4a1080ca2682d72ffb56) [2](https://juicebox.notion.site/Unless-the-ETH-is-Allocated-to-v3-Leave-ETH-in-Multisig-Cover-v2-Expenses-fc223e974d7c425791e0cea613984b34)) to cover those funds and move ETH from the multisig into the v3 project.\n4. Got the Emergency Procedures [ratified](https://juicebox.notion.site/Ratify-Emergency-Procedures-2af8454c7da946bc8e6c71f54a0f2d8b), which enabled DAO members to mitigate a high severity issue with v3 JBX issuance.\n5. Set up the [backup Telegram](https://t.me/jbx_backup). If you haven't joined, please do so!\n6. Updated GitHub organization settings, repository settings, third-party permissions, membership, teams, etc.\n7. Updated permissions and settings across Discord, Notion, and several other tools.\n\n### Frontend\n\n1. Implemented [automatic connecting for Gnosis Safes](https://github.com/jbx-protocol/juice-interface/pull/2732) and got Juicebox listed as a default app in the new Safe interface.\n2. [Upgraded project CSV export tools](https://github.com/jbx-protocol/juice-interface/pull/2632), implementing [juice-accountant](https://github.com/filipvvv/juice-accountant) into the frontend. Project can now export spreadsheets with participants, payouts, payments, redemptions, or additions to balance at any block number (with USD conversions).\n3. Built [juicy-spider](https://github.com/jbx-protocol/juicy-spider), a Juicebox project indexer/search using [Sepana](https://sepana.io/), as well as several suggested search algorithms. Peri has been doing the intense work of building this type of indexing and searching into juicebox.money.\n4. Contributed to [this PR](https://github.com/jbx-protocol/juice-subgraph/pull/22) which added funding cycle configuration and init events to the Subgraph.\n5. Added [One day reconfiguration delays](https://github.com/jbx-protocol/juice-interface/pull/2796) to the create flow.\n6. Updated [SEO meta tags](https://github.com/jbx-protocol/juice-interface/pull/2806), rewrote the [How it Works section](https://github.com/jbx-protocol/juice-interface/pull/2805), rewrote the [Homepage FAQs](https://github.com/jbx-protocol/juice-interface/pull/2804), updated the [Navbar](https://github.com/jbx-protocol/juice-interface/pull/2807) and made several other modifications and improvements to website copy/formatting.\n7. Did not get merged, but built a [wallet creation flow](https://github.com/jbx-protocol/juice-interface/pull/2803) into juicebox.money ([demo](https://youtu.be/LVJqg8w5l-8)).\n\n### Analytics\n\n1. Created the [v2/v3 Project Dashboard](https://dune.com/juicebox/v3), which provides trend analytics on payments, project balance, payouts, project tokens, and NFTs.\n2. Created the [Town Hall Dashboard](https://dune.com/juicebox/townhall), which provides trend analytics on project creations, fees, payments, JBX, and cashflows across the protocol.\n3. Created the [JBX Overview Dashboard](https://dune.com/juicebox/jbx).\n4. Created the [DAO Creation Overview](https://dune.com/juicebox/creation), which shows DAO creation across several tools over time. Aeolian [described this dashboard](https://discord.com/channels/775859454780244028/875492319669932053/1041979989718994975) as \"like the best thing ever.\"\n5. Created several other dashboard and queries at DAO members' requests, such as [Recent Recipients by Version](https://dune.com/juicebox/recent-recipients), [Network Effect](https://dune.com/juicebox/network), and many individual queries (131 queries as of the time of this proposal).\n\n### Documentation\n\n1. Rewrote the project creator documentation (see Education.1).\n2. Updated DAO documentation, including governance guides and new media guidelines.\n3. Broke the blog down into several categories, and created a new [landing page](https://info.juicebox.money/blogs/).\n4. Technical maintenance — upgrades, bug fixes, maintaining the blog's search engine, and other tasks.\n5. Improved the SEO and performance of the docs, and built tools to automate image conversions and other tasks moving forwards.\n\n### Community\n\n1. Created the Defifa Discord server, with token-gated channels for each NFT tier and custom-built Twitter & minting feeds. Wrote copy, embeds, etc.\n2. Managed JuiceboxDAO's Discord server. Permissions, moderation, channels, etc.\n3. Helped to run town halls. Recorded and archived them.\n4. Ongoing maintainence of Notion and other tooling.\n\n### Education\n\n1. Rewrote the project creator documentation. New introduction section; new configuration guide; guides on custody, governance, community management, visibility, and analytics; two Discord server templates, and guides on how to use them; adding the legal guide; and an updated brand kit.\n2. [Project Creation Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2s2OyxG_rvo) on YouTube.\n3. Spoke on a DAO workstream panel and conducted a Juicebox workshop at DAOhaus' DAOcember event.\n4. Prototyped website/content for [Juice CNTR](https://github.com/filipvvv/juice-cntr) — a website for Chinese-speaking project creators.\n5. Various onboarding calls, helped out several project creators.\n\n### Multisig\n\n1. Created and implemented [gaswoman](https://github.com/filipvvv/gaswoman), a node.js program which automatically builds gas reimbursements for a Safe multisig. We used this to conduct our first gas reimbursement since June of 2022.\n2. Queued and managed most transactions that were not project reconfigurations. Made sure things got signed and executed in time.\n\n### Partnerships\n\n1. Started and developed partnership with [Sepana](https://sepana.io/), and helped JuiceboxDAO get added to Sepana's closed private beta. This is leading towards a massive improvement in discoverability and UX on juicebox.money — thanks to Peri's help, users will soon be able to search project descriptions and titles, and can have customized weighted search queries based on balance, trending scores, or other information. This also opens the door for project tags and other metadata improvements, as well as [simplifying the subgraph](https://discord.com/channels/939317843059679252/1035458515709464586/1067192160786579466).\n2. Started and developed partnership with [Dune](https://dune.com), and helped JuiceboxDAO get added to Dune's closed private API beta. Although we haven't built with this yet, it enables us to add detailed on-chain analytics to juicebox.money in the future using Dune's engine.\n3. Began work on partnership with cupOjoseph from [Feather](https://featherdapp.com/). If implemented, this may help us add fiat payments and oauth2 login to juicebox.money.\n4. Explored partnerships with Polygon, Aragon, Addressable, Karma, Stripe, and several other groups — often in collaboration with other DAO members.\n5. Created the artwork, [website](https://retirement.army), Discord server, and copy for the MONKEY RETIREMENT ARMY project, which was a test for managing a Juicebox project with PartyBid v2. Nicholas started the partnership and Peri helped to manage the party.\n6. Continued discussions with ARCx regarding frontend analytics and growth. Strath has been leading this lately.\n\n### Miscellaneous\n\n1. Managing [billing](https://juicebox.notion.site/Recurring-Multisig-Payout-for-Figma-and-Notion-380114a35d584f74b8e83d1583d6ab14).\n2. Improvements to the [Governance Process](https://juicebox.notion.site/Governance-Process-Amendment-8-Earlier-Temp-Checks-Clarify-Execution-b83b36f2c9ed4397846a74b5acb0adbd).\n3. Update [Reserve Token Allocation](https://juicebox.notion.site/Update-Reserved-Token-Allocation-Maintain-DAO-Reserve-570bd48f648b4333a8aecae03ec17c66)\n4. Update [Snapshot Strategies](https://juicebox.notion.site/Update-Juicebox-Snapshot-Strategies-c90de157c9b74060bf7399e92f463c05) to account for v2/v3 JBX.\n\n## What I'm working on now\n\n- A parser which reads a Solidity repository and generates documentation in the style of the current Juicebox docs. This will help to document NFT rewards and other projects as they are developed.\n- Better notification services to help JuiceboxDAO and project creators engage with their communities. Starting with email notifications, Discord bots, and Telegram bots.\n\n## What I would like to do next\n\n- Continue work on the items listed above, as well as new things that will come up.\n- Learn more about frontend development and JavaScript. I haven't dedicated too much time to learning, and there are signficant gaps in my knowledge.\n- Continue automating simple work. I often have to delay larger projects (like the ones I'm working on now) because I get caught up in day-to-day tasks. Going forwards, I would like to minimize this when possible.\n- Emphasize longer-term strategy for me and other DAO members.\n- There are several YouTube videos I would like to make.\n\n\n---\n[Discussion Thread](https://discord.com/channels/775859454780244028/873248745771372584/1068487694935674881) | [IPFS](https://bafkreiedxhm5unb4xzatm5v5fgcuc4volninvfi22mid7mj5av54hgnkce.ipfs.nftstorage.link)",

      "content": "\nStatus: Discussion\n\n\n```text\nAuthor: Nicholas\nDate: 2023-01-27\n```\n\n\n## Synopsis\n\n\nRenew payout to _dao dev inc._ for 7 FCs. Direct payout to _dao dev inc_’s new Juicebox project. Accept revised Terms of Engagement with _dao dev inc._\n\n\n## Motivation\n\n\nIn the past 7 cycles I’ve worked on:\n\n\n### Partnerships, Recruiting, and Creative Direction\n\n- Rants For You - Gabriel Haines\n\t- Goal: Demonstrate utility NFT application for content creators\n\t- I conceived of the project, its setup and format, sold Gabriel on trying it, and launched 100% of the Juicebox config on his behalf. I also bought several specific rants to make the project happen on social media. I did the first artworks, Brileigh did the second, and Sage has prepared a third.\n- NFT Tokenomics Office Hours\n\t- Goal: Improve NFT tokenomics across projects on the protocol.\n\t- I had the idea, I started the show, I made the art, and I host it on Twitter Spaces with Jango. I record the intros and Matthew and Brileigh edit and post the show. The show is very good imho.\n\t- Thus far failed experiments monetizing via NFTs.\n- Partybid x Juicebox Demo - Monkey Helpers\n\t- Goal: Demonstrate PartyBids can issue NFTs on Juicebox\n\t- I had the idea for configuring the sale of NFTs via a PartyBid. I setup the PartyBid and Filip did a big job creating the JB project, art, twitter and discord.\n- JBDAO Publications\n\t- Providing creative input into Juicenews and Juicecast, occasional tutorial videos or blogs\n- Nance/Juicetool\n\t- Goal: Make good on the latent potential of Nance / Juicetool.\n\t- Slowly helping to consolidate what Jiggly and Twodam have built into a simple coherent turnkey governance solution: process + frontend/backend. They were already essentially headed this direction, but I clarified need and am working through designs with both of them.\n- Krause Haus Bounty\n\t- Facilitated development of Acidicsantana's Krause Haus project. We had lengthy dm convos leading up to the project, and occasional correspondence during planning, to tune his ideas for bounties into something achievable short term, with a clear concept, and specific tactics for maximizing impact and feasability.\n- Lexicon Devils\n\t- Helped with v3 migration, and provide consistent feedback and pitch treasury configs and partnerships to increase revenues and engagement. Attempting to connect with underground NFT scene but in practice impact has been minimal, they've mostly done their own thing.\n- JBX CN\n\t- Conceived of project seeking to attract Chinese language devs and project creators to a JBDAO-connected hub project, and ideated on next steps and remit with Filip and Zhape. Very limited progress thus far, despite good concept. Communication and alignment needs work. Still promising.\n- ConstitutionDAO2\n\t- I kicked off the convo in PeopleDAO discord and played role in the early planning stages: assessed internal social needs, successfully pitched NFT centric raise as distinct from CDAO1. Lots of talk with Nucleo as well.\n- Smaller experiments: Juicepill Mark Nadal, Web3 Galaxy Brain Ad Spots.\n- Ongoing BD, Partnership, and project facilitation convos: Llama, Code4rena (and related Audit Fund candidates), Build Guild, JokeDAO, Blunt Finance, PartyDAO, Seed Club, Gitcoin, Aragon, Mfers, PolygonDAO, Zora/Public Assembly, Lenster, Endaoment, Qwestive, NounsDAO periphery, SharkDAO. This takes a lot of effort and time.\n\n### Internal Comms\n\n- Town Hall moderation with Filip\n- Consistent honest voice in governance, even when it's hard, despite political inexpedience of this posture. Goal: set an example that we say what we think, for the health of the DAO and quality of life of its contributors.\n- Occasional Discord support for project creators\n- Helping organize visibility efforts\n\n### External comms\n\n- Lots of tweeting about Juicebox\n- Rep JB to an extent on twitter spaces (Den, FrankenPunks, Mfers, others idk)\n- In person & 1-on-1 online jb shilling to Ethereum builders\n- ENS Tutorial: [https://info.juicebox.money/blog/juicebox-donate-with-ens/](https://info.juicebox.money/blog/juicebox-donate-with-ens/)\n- Talk at UMichigan that 0xSTVG organized\n\n### Operations\n\n- Governance process stewardship\n- Delicately managing interpersonal conflicts to avoid unneeded drama, at times\n\n### Protocol + Product\n\n- Wrote (and have yet to deploy) v1 token uri resolver\n- Lots of frontend feedback, bug reports, and product design input\n\t- Cmd + k Project Search\n\t- Push for no-UI advanced features\n\nIn the next 7 cycles I’d like to focus on product and application development via production/creative direction and execution roles where appropriate. Focuses: Creative direction of experiments and project support,  NFT Tokenomics experiments, Partnerships, Internal/External Comms.\n\n\n## Specification\n\n\nPay $8000 of ETH to v2 [project 412](https://juicebox.money/v2/p/412) (dao dev inc) for 7 cycles (GC 41 through 48 inclusive). \n\n\nBy approving this proposal, JuiceboxDAO confirms that it has read and agrees to _dao dev inc._’s revised Terms of Engagement (ipfs://QmSfynSWotZmkwv8vc7MAjofewj1rJa1woWxyDRVrBEQXE). \n\n\n## Rationale\n\n\nJuiceboxDAO needs visibility and product applications badly. We’re spending more than we make and most outsiders don’t understand any of Juicebox’s core mechanisms or affordances. My job is demonstrating these and focusing on shipping tasteful solutions for the most promising endeavors that are open to incubation support from JBDAO.\n\n\nThis proposal ALSO introduces revised Terms of Engagement that\n\n- Clarify that the Terms are between JuiceboxDAO and _dao dev inc._\n- Clarify that the Terms apply if the DAO votes to approve the proposal according to the present Governance Process\n- Clarify that the IP created during this contract is persistently licensed to the DAO, removing some confusing language.\n- Clarify that _dao dev inc._ is not indemnifying JuiceboxDAO for use of its Services.\n\nPointing funds at a Juicebox project will increase dogfooding of JBDAO, encourage more folks to do the same, and at the expense of 2.5% of the payout’s total value from _dao dev inc._’s perspective\n\n\n## Risks\n\n\nI do not perform meaningful work during this recurring payout period. \n\n\n## Timeline\n\n\nStarts in GC 41 and active through GC 47 inclusive. \n\n\nMust be renewed before the start of GC 48.  \n\n\n\n---\n[Discussion Thread](https://discord.com/channels/775859454780244028/873248745771372584/1068626502326943744) | [IPFS](https://bafkreietl47nbftol2uxfjufh4oavgt373sfbqgnjzljasymoebtecfqaq.ipfs.nftstorage.link)",

      "content": "\n```text\nAuthor: @JZ\nDate: 2022-01-26\n```\n\n\n## Synopsis\n\n\n_Set up a referral program to incentivize people to refer new people to create Juicebox projects_\n\n\n## Motivation\n\n- **Drive** **growth:** Juicebox has a strong community with a great product, there could be huge potential to unlock project creation growth if we deploy a referral program\n- **Drive project success:** with the right model, a referral program can incentivize project onboarders to help projects raise funds post-launch\n\n## Specification\n\n- Create a juicebox project for Juicebox referral trial: [https://juicebox.money/v2/p/410](https://juicebox.money/v2/p/410)\n- Deposit 3000 USD worth of ETH to the Juicebox referral project trail\n- If the ETH isn’t rewarded within first 4 month, put it back to Juicebox treasury\n\n**Overview**\n\n- Anyone can generate a unique referral link\n- There is no limitation of how many referrals each person can generate\n- To be treated as a referral, the referee needs to create a juicebox project on juicebox.money that raised at least 0.5 ETH.\n\n**Reward structure**\n\n- For affiliates/referrer: 10% of the JBDAO fee collected from the referred project for the first 4 months\n- For Qwestive: 1% of the JBDAO fee collected from the referred project for the first 4 month as platform commission fee (Details see in Fee for Qwestive section)\n- Rewards will be distributed once every 2 weeks\n\n**Fee for Qwestive**\n\n- Unlimited referrals\n- No upfront cost, pay-as-you-go model, 10% commission of rewards sent to affiliates. (e.g. if there are 0.1 ETH rewards sent to affiliates, Qwestive will have a fee of 0.01 ETH)\n- Qwestive will create a juicebox project as one of the payout address on the juicebox referral project, calculate the fee for distribution\n\n**Video demo:**\n\n\n[https://www.loom.com/share/00259b4eeaed47fba64be81a186c667e](https://www.loom.com/share/00259b4eeaed47fba64be81a186c667e)\n\n\n**Pitch:**\n\n\n[https://www.canva.com/design/DAFXTeyOX6s/lTed4338tZ56oEiwr1LKcQ/edit?utm_content=DAFXTeyOX6s&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link2&utm_source=sharebutton](https://www.canva.com/design/DAFXTeyOX6s/lTed4338tZ56oEiwr1LKcQ/edit?utm_content=DAFXTeyOX6s&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link2&utm_source=sharebutton)\n\n\n## Questions\n\n1. How would the implementation looks like?\n\t1. The only work will be injecting a script and send us an event when the referee connect the wallet. On the other hand, Qwestive team will also happy to do a PR for peel to review as well if it makes things easier\n2. How would JBDAO handle distribute reward to the affiliates?\n\t1. There are 2 options\n\t\t1. Option 1: Use disperse - Rewards can be distributed once every funding cycle via disperse to list of affiliates & rewards. In the meantime, Qwestive will be implementing similar feature on Qwestive platform directly, which should be ready around mid/end of Feb\n\t\t2. Option 2: Use juicebox project to distribute rewards - A project can be created on Juicebox, and JBDAO to fund it for some smallish budget ($3k). if the eth isn't rewarded within 4 months, put it back in the jbdao treasury. The reward can be distributed once every 2 weeks, just adding all affiliates wallet & reward amount in distribution list\n\t2. I will recommend go with option 1, as Qwestive will implement the reward distribution feature inside, so a multi sig solution can work better, without no extra work to manually logging the referral reward every 2 weeks\n\n## Rationale\n\n\nWith 10% of JBDAO fee for the first 4 month, it can create the incentive to get referrers to continuously help projects be active and raise funds. \n\n\n## Risks\n\n\nThere could be a case that project creators game the system and refer themselves, however we do have the practice to mitigate this:\n\n1. The reward distribution is not automatic, so there are time to stop the reward if we identify something suspicious\n2. Qwestive is also developing practice like device fingerprints, to make sure it will be flagged if someone refer themselves\n\nBottomline is even this happen, it will still be ROI positive activities\n\n\n## Timeline\n\n\nQwestive plan to get launched on ETH around mid~end Feb, once the proposal passes, we will start planning the implementation\n\n\n\n---\n[Discussion Thread](https://discord.com/channels/775859454780244028/873248745771372584/1068097166364647435) | [IPFS](https://bafkreibkocane7p75ggrsnyx64rxo4pszhpu33tzs5dc2jbl5lk62c5jgq.ipfs.nftstorage.link)",

      "content": "\nStatus: Discussion\n\n\n```text\nAuthor: DrGorilla.eth\nDate: (YYYY-MM-DD)\n```\n\n\n## Synopsis\n\n\nOffer to renew DrGorilla.eth (contract engineer) recurring payout, with the same amount and duration as the previous one ($18500/fc for 7 fc)\n\n\n## Motivation\n\n\nThe previous proposal mentioned the following projects and here are the latest related statuses:\n\n- swap allocator: this project is now done.\n- bridge allocator & L2: these have been post-poned by a couple of months, the protocol still being in the process of migrating to V3. The bridge allocator is designed and currently in draft, L2 is ready to be deployed.\n- \"others\": see below\n\nHere are other project I've coded/take part in during these last 6 fc which are now over:\n\n- Buyback delegate: I coded it for V2 and now refactored it for V3, it is now ready for use, when $JBX is migrated\n- Delegates registry: This is an onchain registry for deployers associated with delegates. Use-case is for frontends to easily validate a new delegate\n- I created the UnumDAO opt-in contract, allowing ConstitutionDAO2 contributors to easily swap their CDAO2 NFT for an unumDAO one\n\nHere are some of my on-going projects:\n\n- V3 eth terminal monitoring/alerting system: without it, in the event of a hack, we might not notice anything (and take appropriate actions) for a long time - this is part of an on-going effort we're leading with @filipv in creating emergency procedures.\n- Juice distributor: this is a staking contract, gathering reserved token from multiple project and allow staker to receive a weekly basket. This is an early stage project (we discussed the design, I've coded some test and I'm now starting to implement - this is TDD for the coding geeks)\n- NFT reward: this is an ever moving contract, as we gather more feedback and idea, and push new versions accordingly\n\nYou can track (this is another mini-project I'm doing) all the contract crew work and status here: [https://github.com/orgs/jbx-protocol/projects/5](https://github.com/orgs/jbx-protocol/projects/5) - note not all project's from this proposal are listed, as I started tracking them roughly 2-3fc ago...\n\n\nThis list is non-exhaustive (I might forget some along the ways) and does not take into account projects where I'm not considering myself as \"core\" but still give a hand (reviewing, testing, etc).\n\n\nEdit 27/01: This projects list size, in the light of the latest issue we faced, will be reduced in the future, in order to avoid having multiple projects interfering with each other - quality over quantity.\n\n\n## Specification\n\n\nContinue the current scheme while modifying the recipient address: send 18500$ worth of ETH to the V3 Juicebox project 421 ([https://juicebox.money/v2/p/421](https://juicebox.money/v2/p/421)), each FC, for a total of 7FC.\n\n\nThis should have been the project 420, but DrGorilla.eth is a stupid ass monkey and burned the 420…\n\n\n## Rationale\n\n\nAt some point in the future, we might not need any on-chain addition. As mentioned, our current pipeline is not at this point yet, hence this proposal.\n\n\n## Risks\n\n\nDrGorilla might:\n\n- stop producing quality code (potentially leading to a loss of treasury fund)\n- disappear\n- just start being an overall jerk (without prejudging of the actual jerk status)\n\n## Timeline\n\n\nImmediate execution\n\n\n\n---\n[Discussion Thread](https://discord.com/channels/775859454780244028/873248745771372584/1068495612183576617) | [IPFS](https://bafkreiglxms3xvfwsuirdsiqofumyh4zhn7fp3d5r5gfb52b3pyimrjt5i.ipfs.nftstorage.link)",

Please find details of my previous proposals here\n\n\n\n[link_to_page](b166c993-5353-416e-a473-4d717419c2f9)\n\n\n[link_to_page](38f2e6ca-b592-453c-9469-1954ca54fa14)\n\n\n[link_to_page](80cb5a65-a0a6-4cc3-9047-59440a52dc87)\n\n\n## Motivation:\n\n\nSince my[ ](/38f2e6cab592453c94691954ca54fa14)last recurring proposal ended, here is the work I have done in chronological order:\n\n- Worked on writing contracts + tests  and post audit changes for V3 Migration including the v1 & v2 allocators ([Commits](https://github.com/jbx-protocol/juice-v3-migration/commits?author=viraj124))\n- Code reviews and writing tests and docs for juice buyback ([Commits](https://github.com/jbx-protocol/juice-buyback/commits?author=viraj124))\n- Help with royalty support for juice-delegate v1.2 version ([PR](https://github.com/jbx-protocol/juice-721-delegate/pull/110))\n- Updated/Fixed tests, and code review for sorting tiers by a category instead of contribution floor in juice-delegate v1.2 version ([PR](https://github.com/jbx-protocol/juice-721-delegate/pull/113))\n- Research how different protocols out there are handling staking & fee distribution for synergies around jbx/jb-ve-nft with juice-distributor\n- PR reviews for juice-delegate-registry, unum-optin & blunt-finance\n\n## Risks:\n\n- Code quality isn’t up to the mark\n- Unable to deliver according to the timelines\n- Viraz could go AWOL\n\n## Specification:\n\n\nFor the next 7 funding cycles renew Viraz’s [**0xviraz.eth**  ⇒(`0x2dda8dc2f67f1eb94b250caefac9de16f70c5a51`)] recurring payouts for $4000 per funding cycle in the JuiceBox DAO.\n\n\n## Rationale:\n\n\nThe exposure that I have gained technically past year after joining the DAO as a contributor has been immense and I have enjoyed learning from the other contributors and implementing those learnings into what I have done. I feel I have taken the feedback I was given throughout and implemented that in some capacity & I want to keep contributing and keep having a positive impact & also learn from the shortcomings I have made while shipping out stuff.\n\n\nThe next things on my todo are mostly related to the priorities the DAO has which include shipping juice-distributor, juice-ve-nft, add support/lead on some bits at least for the development of multiplex data source, and add support/lead on some bits at least to the development of the jb L2 efforts since I feel that is going to add a lot of value, especially with all the scaling effort happening around the Ethereum ecosystem. Besides that also will also potentially resume work on experimental things like apple-juice, etc., depending on the dao priorities, and of course help with any other code reviews and tests so we can ship faster.\n\n\n## Timeline:\n\n\nEnter Recurring Payouts starting at FC 41 for the next 7 funding cycles until FC 47.\n\n\n## Copyright Disclaimer:\n\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n\n\n\n---\n[Discussion Thread](https://discord.com/channels/775859454780244028/873248745771372584/1068502660631769108) | [IPFS](https://bafkreidkby762vfn7mtjnhfgzuajlndzsq3gsxswlcscar4retm3del3sq.ipfs.nftstorage.link)",

To ensure the contracts are safe to use and do not impose any security threats, Bernd was asked by Jango to audit the `JBV3Token.sol` and `JBV3TokenDeployer.sol` contracts in the [https://github.com/jbx-protocol/juice-v3-migration](https://github.com/jbx-protocol/juice-v3-migration) repository.\n\n\nBernd conducted the audit over the course of the last ~2 weeks and provided the dev team with an audit report ([https://hackmd.io/@berndartmueller/2023-01-juice-v3-migration](https://hackmd.io/@berndartmueller/2023-01-juice-v3-migration)).\n\n\nThe security audit identified 0 critical issues, 0 high severity issues, 1 medium severity issue, 6 minor issues, and 6 informational issues.\n\n\n## Specification\n\n\nSend a one-time payment of 6,000 $ worth of ETH + 100k JBX from dao.jbx.eth to 0x6A897b32996D342535791a74B8a40E75DDf2486e\n\n\n## Rationale\n\n\nBernd audited the Juice V3 migration contracts in regard to security vulnerabilities and bugs and crafted an audit report. In return, Bernd asks for compensation of 6,000 $ in ETH + 100k JBX from dao.jbx.eth for the time and resources spent auditing.\n\n\n## Risks\n\n\nThere could still be unidentified vulnerabilities or bugs in the contracts in the scope of the audit.\n\n\n## Timeline\n\n\nImmediate effect\n\n\n\n---\n[Discussion Thread](https://discord.com/channels/775859454780244028/873248745771372584/1062448069972594748) | [IPFS](https://bafkreigfrxmbm4yqno6hndegjovmjk2gt6ny3nbv3oq3tdrh57yrrke6ca.ipfs.nftstorage.link)",

      "content": "\nStatus: Draft\n\n\n```text\nAuthor: Onni\nDate: (2023-01-13)\n```\n\n\n## Synopsis\n\n\nProject aims to shore up existing Comms resources by shoring up some best practice resources and supplying them to existing efforts and projects.\n\n\n## Motivation\n\n\n_What problem does this solve? Why now?_\n\n\nJuicebox is need of increased exposure among both developers and project creators. We are at a juncture whereby those demographics must grow to prevent Juicebox from becoming an insular exercise at best or dying at worst. Likewise, creators are having trouble bringing new members into their projects; these resources will also aid in that cause.\n\n\n_How exactly will this be executed? Be specific and leave no ambiguity._\n\n\nJB Treasury pays Onni 1762.50 USD (in ETH) at start and 1762.50 USD (in ETH) at completion. Second payout at discretion of Multi-Sig (with understanding that media placements may not publish until later date.) \n\n\n## Rationale\n\n\nWe all seem to agree that added visibility is necessary, but the speicifics spark debate. This proposal aims to focus on building a foundation by employng some established techniques; moving forward, they can be evolved into more Web3 native techniques, like a Comms versioning.\n-- Media List (Deliverable: 30 A&B quality media contacts compiled into sharing spreadsheet.)\n-- Bulk Up Email List (Deliverable: 2x increase in subscribers)\n-- Press Release Tool Kit (Deliverables: Templates and Instructions for members to use.)\n-- Metrics Round Up (Deliverable: Deck utilizing dashboard and other metrics to illustrate stats re ROI, cost per user, etc.)\n-- Initial outreach to media (Deliverable: 3 placements for Juicebox or Juicebox projects on third party media.)\n-- Press Kit (Deliverable: Media Resource Kit)\n\n\n## Risks\n\n\nOnni may not execute. Additionally, there may be no additional audience for Juicebox (but doubtful).\n\n\n## Timeline\n\n\nWork will begin immediately and will take about four weeks. Media placements may be longer as we can not control when an outlet choses to run a story or stream a podcast.\n\n\n\n---\n[Discussion Thread](https://discord.com/channels/775859454780244028/873248745771372584/1064048057441845288) | [IPFS](https://bafkreigsb5uctvcuxrx26mxsxjvtijeah4xuras7umbr33e4ivdb7waudy.ipfs.nftstorage.link)",

      "title": "JBP-326 - Renew payout to Jango, no changes.",
      "content": "\nStatus: Draft\n\n\n```text\nAuthor: jango.eth\nDate: (2022-1-12)\n```\n\n\n## Synopsis\n\n\nI'm convinced JuiceboxDAO and the protocol that it stewards should tend toward zero expenditures and changes in order to a) encourage self-sustainable experiments atop it that have self-contained opportunities and risks, and b) minimize ops overhead for clients facilitating protocol interactions, documentation authors, and JBX holders who manage the treasury.\n\n\nI'm excited to build atop the work I've helped orchestrate over the past year stabilizing an extensible protocol and supporting inter-connected full-stack strategies across the JB ecosystem to make Zero a sustainable and productive outcome.\n\n\n## Motivation\n\n\nAfter carrying the load designing and implementing the core protocol, documentation, DAO operations, and project onboarding/strategizing for much of the early part of this past year, I've now had big chunks of these day-to-day responsibilities offloaded to amazing contributors that have taken them on and expanded their efficacy far past what I could've managed alone.\n\n\nIt's allowed me to spend the last half of 2022 leveraging my full-stack understanding of JB and its creative potential to fill the more high-level role of helping cross-project strategy, prioritization, and focus:\n\n- Lead the design and implementation of `JB721Delegate` contract, and coordinated with Peel, StudioDAO, Defifa, and others over many months to make it available and useful to all.\n- Lead the design and implementation of the protocol's versioning strategy to reduce risk for project owners and protocol extension developers now and into the future, and coordinated with Peel, Nance, and others over many months to make trusted migration paths clear for all.\n- On-call for resolving worst-case emergency scenarios involving the reliability of the protocol. Luckily nothing major has happened, but the constant vigilance can still weigh heavy especially as new code and experiences make it to production.\n- Generally just try to be up-to-date with ongoing conversations and hot-topics around the ecosystem, identifying patterns that can serve as solutions across various problem sets, and connecting dots where I see symbiotic opportunities.\n\n \n\n\nMy motivation is now threefold:\n\n\nFirst, I plan to encourage the technical implementation and ratification of remaining core componentry that had versioning efforts as pre-requisites:\n\n- JBX buyback delegate, so contributors to JuiceboxDAO can receive the best available rate for JBX.\n- Delegate registry, so projects can make use of multiple pay/redeem delegates at the same time, and web-clients safely expose these extensions to the public.\n- veNFT research and implementation, to pave a sturdier path towards on-chain DAO governance.\n- Multi-chain research and implementation, to pave a sturdier path towards multi-chain Juicebox protocol that keeps JBX interests in mind.\n- Front-end incentivization research and implementation, to incentivize self-sustaining access points to the Juicebox protocol.\n\nEach of these efforts are meant to be a) generalizable for any Juicebox project, and b) give projects tools leverageable for new revenue streams and self-sustainability.\n\n\nSecond, I plan to encourage JuiceboxDAO to assess its expenditure and token issuance strategies more critically, and help projects design treasury configurations that make opportunities/risks clearer to capital allocators. I imagine a world where JuiceboxDAO's greatest assets are the project tokens it holds from contributions to Peel, WAGMI, Lexicon Devils, etc. I think it's important for JuiceboxDAO to begin treating our expenditures more like bets, it'll help us identify tools and strategies missing from the Juicebox toolset that contribute to capital allocator confidence.\n\n\nLastly, I plan on spending more time contributing to the development and sustainability of independent projects such as Defifa, Peel, Blunt, WAGMI, Nance, StudioDAO, etc -- with more to come. I plan on tapering my JuiceboxDAO payout requests as my work on the core protocol and strategy subside, and take on new risks/opportunities with my time. So many ecosystem projects are brilliantly staffed and have so much potential, I want to help make these successful regenerative treasuries and feel my full-picture and full-stack understanding of the Juicebox ecosystem can help continue expanding opportunities for all despite nudging JuiceboxDAO toward zero.\n\n\n## Specification\n\n\nRecurring payout of $21,000 to project ID 55 for 6 cycles.\n\n\n## Rationale\n\n\nStandard process.\n\n\n## Risks\n\n\nTrusting Jango with execution.\n\n\n## Timeline\n\n\nNext possible funding cycle.\n\n\n\n---\n[Discussion Thread](https://discord.com/channels/775859454780244028/873248745771372584/1063116018244919456) | [IPFS](https://bafkreifmzjgjfuezxxm65ow6ae2qioe2inbfx5kdzalkei3zdh4u67jhyu.ipfs.nftstorage.link)",

      "content": "\n```text\nAuthor: Nicholas\nDate: 2022-12-30\n```\n\n\n## Synopsis\n\n\nExtend the multisig’s permission to set the TokenUriResolver till the end of February.\n\n\n## Motivation\n\n\nThe TokenUriResolver gives metadata to JB Projects. The first iteration is ready to ship. This proposal will extend the permission the DAO gave the multisig to set and change the TokenUriResolver in [JBP-267](https://juicetool.xyz/snapshot/jbdao.eth/proposal/0x44ca6ed9c0ea0bcaac4a6cc96127de3185e2eac2cf1a8b47c2f026680a6c6c4c) - Give the Multisig permission to set tokenUriResolver.\n\n\n## Specification\n\n\nGrant the multisig permission to set and change the tokenUriResolver. Nicholas and Jango (and other members of the contract crew) will communicate with the multisig to update the tokenUriResolver over time as they deem necessary.\n\n\n## Rationale\n\n\nThe tokenUriResolver is a low stakes parameter of the protocol. Granting open ended permission to the multisig to update it poses no major threat to the security or usability of the protocol, and gives JBDAO’s devs the opportunity to improve the tokenUriResolver contract iteratively.\n\n\n## Risks\n\n\nThe tokenUriResolver could be used to deploy bad metadata that is deceptive or underwhelming. In the extreme worst case, the tokenUriResolver could enable malicious wallet interaction in unsafe NFT metadata browsers — though OpenSea and other major marketplaces have protections in place to remove this threat vector.\n\n\n## Timeline\n\n\nGrant open ended permission to the multisig to update the tokenUriResolver until the end of February. \n\n\n\n---\n[Discussion Thread](https://discord.com/channels/775859454780244028/873248745771372584/1058518047897419777) | [IPFS](https://bafkreigyenj2xxx5coubrtcgwldw7sgqyo5hgnllinidmh34d6hyic4d3e.ipfs.nftstorage.link)",

Multisig discretion in execution should be clarified. Links to Notion should be replaced with links to Juicetool.\n\n\n## Motivation/Rationale\n\n- Temperature checks can feel rushed right now. Authors can submit proposals before temperature checks begin, but feedback is usually sparse until temperature checks formally open. Enabling voting upon a proposal’s submission encourages early discussion (and earlier submission), which will lead to better proposals.\n- Multisig discretion is not explicitly formalized in the governance process.

      "content": "\n```text\nAuthor: Nicholas\nDate: 2022-12-13\n```\n\n\n## Synopsis\n\n\nRevoke [**JBP-308 - ConstitutionDAO2 Fundraiser**](https://juicetool.xyz/snapshot/jbdao.eth/proposal/0xc17147882387bb66baa7642b1dde58f15bda1d79a52f176edc6aeba29cac66de). \n\n\nTransfer the ~127 ETH (that has already been moved from JBDAO’s v1 treasury to the JBDAO multisig to fulfill JBP-308) to the JBDAO V3 treasury instead of ConstitutionDAO2. \n\n\n## Motivation\n\n\nSotheby’s has delayed the Constitution 2 auction to an unannounced future date. The ConstitutionDAO2 fundraise is debating pausing donations and activating redemptions. Until the future of the ConstitutionDAO2 fundraise is clear, the $150k grant should be reversed and funds taken from the JBDAO V1 treasury into the multisig should be moved to the JBDAO V3 treasury, instead of the ConstitutionDAO2 project. \n\n\nWhat’s more, the specification of JBP-308 is not executable as written. The original plan was to pause donations to CDAO2 on Dec 12, 2022 — several days before the GC#37 is executed. JBP-308 specifies that $150k should move from JBDAO v1 to the multisig, then into the WAGBTC raise. This would not be possible as that project intended to pause donations by that time. This makes the proposal not executable as written and places the multisig in the awkward position of having to approximate the language of the proposal — an action that should be avoided. \n\n\nShould the auction’s new date be announced, the WAGBTC team can make a new grant proposal to JBDAO.\n\n\n## Specification\n\n\nThe JBDAO multisig should `addToBalance` 127**.**481413342253837412 ETH to the JBDAO v3 treasury.\n\n\n## Rationale\n\n\n$150k (127**.**481413342253837412 ETH) was transferred from JBDAO v1 treasury to the multisig when Distribute was called during GC#37 ([Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x5b227dc72edcfffc346908d6c3e9cb063c94c4ecae2b4e1341531c6389b99d27)). The exact amount of ETH transferred to the multisig to fulfill JBP-308 should instead be transferred from the multisig into the JBDAO v3 treasury using the `addToBalance` function as soon as this proposal passes, or anytime during GC#38. \n\n\n## Risks\n\n\nThe ConstitutionDAO2 fundraise could take place sooner than they are able to pass a new governance proposal for the same grant amount. \n\n\n## Timeline\n\n\nGC38\n\n\n\n---\n[Discussion Thread](https://discord.com/channels/775859454780244028/873248745771372584/1052324413556674590) | [IPFS](https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmNd8vEDeG2MXePi8smdVtcFENMgk5hjksmZmp8yvNGQxZ)",

      "content": "\n```text\nAuthor: Zeugh\nDate: (2022-12-16)\n```\n\n\n## Synopsis\n\n\nSend the Thirsty Thirsty Tier 1 membership NFTs to Juicebox contributors and community that've been involved with the ThirstyThirsty partnership.\n\nKeep the 19 bottles of collector Pinot Noir that come with the Tier 1 membership NFTs in a JBX cellar to be pulled with one month advance by JBX community for a future IRL event or gathering. \n\n\n## Motivation\n\n\nWe have 19 Tier 1 Membership NFTs that belong to JuiceboxDAO and are completely useless while they just sit like that. The original goal of those was distribution, and it never happened. TT is now implementing governance with 1 vote per NFT held. The NFTs should be distributed to enthusiastic JBX individuals who have or would like to participate more with TT so they can vote and write proposals. \n\n\nThirsty Thirsty reconnects JBX folks back to Nature & healing through food & wine experiences. Thirsty Thirsty can become an impactful player in the ReFi & Impact DAO communities while making IRL remediation happen in land sites around the world. TT's IRL locations and experiences can provide IRL respite for the internet beings of JBX for restoration, inspiration, and meaningful relating.\n\nThirstyThirsty is an awesome community and it's growth in connection to Juicebox ecosystem brings us closer to other interesting projects like Endaoment and SeedClub.\n\n\n## Specification\n\n\nOut of the 19 NFTs we have I propose the following distribution:\n\n- 14 NFTs to be distributed one to each of the JB members who were directly involved with the [previous proposal on this distribution](https://juicetool.xyz/snapshot/jbdao.eth/proposal/0x91563a522c8cdccab5fd1c9d2f6f1908b05153693eba93aa96bb2f58790123d8) or directly engaged with Thirsty Thirsty in our partnerships:\n\n\t```text\n\t  Sage\n\t  Zom_bae\n\t  Felixander\n\t  Jigglyjams\n\t  Burtula\n\t  0xSTVG\n\t  Kenbot\n\t  Rakelle\n\t  Filipv\n\t  Jango\n\t  Zeugh\n\t  Peri\n\t  Nicholas \n\t\tGulan\n\t```\n\n\n\t\n\n\n- 5 NFTs will remain in the JBX treasury to be distributed to JBX community that gets involved and/or supports to Thirsty Thirsty community digitally or IRL\n\n## Rationale\n\n\nThis proposal rewards the members of JuiceboxDAO who engage with the project Thirsty Thirsty and makes it possible for them to access the full potential of their community. Thirsty Thirsty brings the JB influence further to new creators and creatives at the intersection of hospitality, ecological farming, and web3.\n\n\n## Risks\n\n\nThe receivers might never use it and just drop on secondary.\nThe broader community may never get to taste this wine associated with the NFTs.\nGovernance is new and folks may not participate fully. \n\n\n## Timeline\n\n\nThe proposal should be executed on the execution period of the current GC.\n\n\n\n---\n[Discussion Thread](https://discord.com/channels/775859454780244028/873248745771372584/1053415523184025630) | [IPFS](https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmSGK2v74phWs2UPz92mbFCeYhz8pcNp963CneQstbXUkr)",

      "title": "JBP-310 - Distribute 15M JBX to Reserved List addresses",
      "content": "\nStatus: Discussion\n\n\n```text\nAuthor: Nicholas\nDate: (2022-12-13)\n```\n\n\n## Synopsis\n\n\nDistribute 400k JBX from the multisig to each of the 25 addresses on the Reserved list (except the multisig itself), for a total of 10M JBX. \n\n\nAllocate 5M JBX to be distributed from the multisig according to a Ranked Choice Vote amongst an open list of candidates. \n\n\n## Motivation\n\n\nReserved rate issuance allows JuiceboxDAO to give consistent contributors part of JBX token supply issuance. Builders are issued reserved JBX when their work leads to more issuance. \n\n\nJBX issuance to the reserved list has been very limited due to the compounding effects of a previously aggressive discount rate (issuance today: 61,000 JBX/ETH) and relatively little issuance in general, due to slow revenues since early 2022.\n\n\nAs a result, JuiceboxDAO builders have received very little JBX, despite being on the reserved list for many months. \n\n\nTo give its builders a stronger voice in the DAO they are building, this proposal seeks to distribute JBX to active contributors, and experiment with a small scale JBX distribution by token holder vote.\n\n\n## Specification\n\n\nDistribute 400k JBX from the multisig to each of the following 25 addresses (total 15M JBX):\n\n- burtula.eth\n- jmill.eth\n- jigglyjams.eth\n- 0xstvg.eth\n- 0x2DdA8dc2f67f1eB94b250CaEFAc9De16f70c5A51 (Viraz)\n- filipv.eth\n- zom-bae.eth\n- jb.daodevinc.eth\n- zhape.eth\n- peri.eth\n- drgorilla.eth\n- matthewbrooks.eth\n- jango.eth\n- sagekellyn.eth\n- felixander.eth\n- jb.0xba5ed.eth\n- wraeth.eth\n- twodam.eth\n- aeolian.eth\n- mieos.eth\n- johnnyd.eth\n- gulan.eth\n- brileigh.eth\n- strathmckay.eth\n- 0xblaz.eth\n\nDistribute 5M JBX according to a Ranked Choice Vote. Anyone will be allowed to add their address to the candidates list until Dec 24,2022 at 00:00 UTC. Nicholas will coordinate the details of the Ranked Choice Vote of these candidates, to be voted on by JBX holders, and the DAO will execute its outcome by the end of January 2023. \n\n\n## Rationale\n\n\n15M JBX represents 7.15% of the total v1 $JBX in the multisig (209.5M JBX).\n\n\nFor context, 15M JBX is 0.7% of the total JBX outstanding across all versions (JBX v1/2/3). The multisig currently holds 10% of all v1 $JBX and is tending toward 15% according to the current reserved rate (30% of the 50% of tokens reserved).\n\n\nThis specification will achieve the goal of distributing a modest portion of the DAO's JBX holdings to active DAO contributors to increase governance access and further decentralize JBX ownership.\n\n\n## Risks\n\n\nThe JBX could go to the wrong addresses. \n\n\nSome contributors or ecosystem members not on the list may feel left out.\n\n\nThis proposal could distribute too much of the DAO's JBX; however, given the current reserved rate configuration, **the DAO multisig will always tend toward 15% of all tokens issued, thus replenishing the coffers**. The multisig currently holds 10% of all v1 $JBX, so it is already tending upward.\n\n\n## Timeline\n\n\nThe multisig should execute the proposal before the end of January 2023. If this timeline passes without the proposal being executed, this proposal should be canceled. \n\n\n\n---\n[Discussion Thread](https://discord.com/channels/775859454780244028/873248745771372584/1052301913879744552) | [IPFS](https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmVQ9zQjC7MvHobL4hY5ozeVNh2M4NQdvdLQGEuMPyNZ4x)",

      "content": "\n```text\nAuthor:Mieos\nDate: (2022-12-15)\n```\n\n\n## Thesis\n\n\nWAGMI is currently working on a designing new merch, new stickers/gifs for discord/twitter that will be accessible on the giffy keyboard (you can use some Banny stickers on imessage now!)\n\n\nWAGMI also plans to work with Peel to add new illustrations to the website to help give the website a refresh. \n\n\nWAGMI is working on creating NFT rewards for banny stickers/gifs where partial proceeds will be sent back into the Juicebox treasury. \n\n\nMove WAGMI to V3 \n\n\n## Motivation\n\n\n_Why now? What problems does this solve?_\n\n\nWAGMI continues to be a vital part of JB by adding art and illustrations that bolsters the website/protocol and brings attention and interest to the project. When Juicebox is brought up in conversation it is never without a comment about the hilarious and fun art that comes along with it. WAGMI wants to continue to bring life and entertainment to the protocol. \n\n\n## Specification\n\n\nRecurring payout in the amount of: $8,500/Funding Cycle\n\n\n=\n\n\n$6000 Sage {Art, Illustration, Design, UI}\n\n\n$1500 Burtula {This payout with be for wrapping up current artworks and after 3 FC’s re-assessed \n\n\n$1000 Mieos {Art Direction/Curation, Communications, Connect of dots, Pusher-man}\n\n\nWAGMI Treasury will be moving to V3 for this proposal as well\n\n\n\n## Rationale\n\n\n• Worked on the visual design aspect of the locked JBX NFT project which will bring better incentives to governance and exposure to Juicebox \n\n\n• Using and teaching others features like Project payer address to sell NFT’s into Treasury\n\n\n• Created 40+ emojis and over 85+ stickers which gives life to the JB Discord\n\n\n• Created logo, iconic Banny and other Juicebox characters featured on the website\n\n\n• Creating high quality cultural assets for iconic moments in JB history and for yearly events.\n\n\n• Collaborating with Lexicon Devils to create a unique digital hangout/education center in Crypto Voxels for Juicebox\n\n\n• Educational videos to help explain the more technical features of JB\n\n\n• WAGMI worked on the marketing collateral and assets for the big Morgensterns Ice Cream Event. Which we hope to make art and illustrations for future collaborations! \n\n\n• Helping with UI for Juicebox High \n\n\n• Working on JuiceBox NFT Martketplace with Tankbottoms. [https://bleeding-edge.juicebox.wtf/user](https://bleeding-edge.juicebox.wtf/user)\n\n\n We collaborated with Jango, Tankbottoms, NatashaPankina, Viraz, Mr. Goldstein and others to create a Locked JBX voting NFT that will be beautifully unique in all of web3. \n\n\nMOVING FORWARD: \n\n\n• Collaborate with Peel and other front end people to add new art and illustrations to refresh the JB website. \n\n\n• Focus efforts on meme-ing banny/other characters through merch, more stickers/illustrations\n\n\n• Continue to add value to other projects around the ecosystem though support, education, and unique high quality cultural assets.

Only one transaction is required per month.\n\n## Risks\n\n\nThis is a temporary solution and is not very scalable. The subscription costs may go over the $500 maximum in the specification.\n\n\n## Timeline\n\n\nBilling details should be switched to a debit card operated by filipv within two weeks of this proposal’s Snapshot ratification. These payouts should take place until the soonest of:\n\n1. The DAO no longer having to pay for Figma and Notion.\n2. Another proposal amending or replacing this proposal.\n3.

All token redemptions are also moving to the v3 treasury. Thus, any funds accumuated on v1 should be able to move to v3 without further questions.\n\n\n## Specification\n\n\nRoute $100k from JuiceboxDAO v1 treasury to the v1 => v3 allocator, located at `0x1eb759829b1a3d55193472142f18df3091bcac4b`, per funding cycle until all funds have been reallocated from v1.\n\n\n## Rationale\n\n\nThe allocator was built with this single purpose in mind.\n\n\n## Risks\n\n\nThere is smart contract risk when utilizing additional components. There's also governance risk that there might still be commitments from the v1 treasury that don't get upgraded to v3 in time.\n\n\n## Timeline\n\n\nThe next Funding cycle.\n\n\n\n---\n[Discussion Thread](https://discord.com/channels/775859454780244028/873248745771372584/1053373367740272671) | [IPFS](https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmURud7721k2uWtYLwiyLW48P14aSypzvefCreC2kZZz38)",

Reduce Renew payout to $2500 per FC\n\n\n## Motivation\n\n\nMy recurring payout is set to expire after FC #37\n\n\n## Specification\n\n\nUpdate 12/4/22 - Payouts to mcsa.eth\n\n\n## Rationale\n\n\nI continue to stay focused on lead generation, onboarding, social media presence, business development/partnerships.\n\n\n**Business Development/Partnerships**\n\n\n_University Blockchain Clubs_\n\n\n_**note: during this recurring duration I will be continuing to contact university groups but will focus on art, film, and business groups per a collab/strategy meeting with Jango**_\n\n\n**Highlights September - November**\n\n\n_Update 11/30/22 - University of New South Wales - met with the people who run the society.  Looking to set up a Juicebox project for club governance as well as funding hackathons._  \n\n\nStanford Blockchain Club - Nicholas and Jango spoke about the technical architecture of Juicebox.  In person project set up in progress.\n\n\nUniversity of Michigan Blockchain club - Nicholas, Filip and I spoke about project creation, new features of Juicebox, DAO contributing, DAO governance.\n\n\nConnected with Colombia University Blockchain club.  They know Juicebox and are interested in us giving a prompt for their University hackathon in 2023 called [Lions Den.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb77onn5F0w)\n\n\nConnected with two recent graduates from the London School of Economics through \"cold emailing\" Cambridge Blockchain.  Set up a meeting which included Nicholas, Filip and myself to talk about [Fyde.fi](https://www.fyde.fi/) an on chain treasury management system.  They want to run on JB.\n\n\nWorking with LCLim and Ser (discord names) on their film [The Shiba and the Whale - A Doge Anime](https://juicebox.money/v2/p/316)\n\n\nWorking with [Burrito DAO](https://twitter.com/BurritoDAO), an artist collective, about starting a Juicebox.  DMs are available if anyone wants to see them.\n\n\nWorking with [Black Label Art Culture](https://twitter.com/bl_artcult) on using NFT rewards for their artist reveals and gallery showings.\n\n\nOnboarded [G-Play Studios](https://gplaystudios.live/)\n\n\nOnboarded [K-Group DAO](https://juicebox.money/@kgroupdao)\n\n\nOnboarded [MP3 Radio](https://juicebox.money/v2/p/203)\n\n\n**Partnerships I missed from my last proposal:**\n\n- Talked with UCI, set up a meeting but couldn’t get the meeting on November 21st to work.  Aiming for January.\n- Cal Berkeley Blockchain - in talks\n\nSince September I have taken part in 31 appointments for onboarding or business development.\n\n\n**Social Media**\n\n- Started the [Defifa](https://twitter.com/Defifa420) twitter account.\n- Tweeted NFT per day leading up to the mint (scheduled out to auto tweet per day)\n- Tweeted the hour countdown up until the end of mint (scheduled out to auto tweet per hour)\n- Defifa daily stats through the minting phase\n- Continued activitiy about defifa, stats, facts and pointing system\n- [Defifa point tracking document](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1k6n52ItzJUYC-DcrI-xBfdssm8QWDdIxDTPF6iPF0vw/edit#gid=0)\n- Also produced Defifa stickers.  Handed off to Jango.\n\nDefifa420 twitter handle stats\n\n\n![](https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/4d9495b2-926f-4f47-857c-143a6541e633/Screenshot_2022-11-22_at_3.18.50_PM.png?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Content-Sha256=UNSIGNED-PAYLOAD&X-Amz-Credential=AKIAT73L2G45EIPT3X45%2F20221206%2Fus-west-2%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20221206T000030Z&X-Amz-Expires=3600&X-Amz-Signature=617beb56625fb55d5890054433dcada989a0df46cdf94fd6fe062697a89c84ae&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&x-id=GetObject)\n\n\n![](https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/518485cc-24e3-46c1-b8c1-e4a82f487bf2/Screenshot_2022-11-22_at_3.19.26_PM.png?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Content-Sha256=UNSIGNED-PAYLOAD&X-Amz-Credential=AKIAT73L2G45EIPT3X45%2F20221206%2Fus-west-2%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20221206T000030Z&X-Amz-Expires=3600&X-Amz-Signature=bb7a43c590f2e92ecef6342fcf01fe97f544bdeaaa9be1252a17bef9df4ebdba&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&x-id=GetObject)\n\n\nGenerally staying well informed of all the things going on in the Juicebox ecosystem.  This allows me to create concise and informative weekly recap threads.  The threads also served (imo) as the foundation for the Juicenews Newsletter.\n\n\n**Lead Generation**\n\n\nI continue to evangelize Juicebox via social media.  When I describe lead generation I am specifically talking about twitter DMs, Instagram DMs, joining discord groups in order to find pepole that are interested in building on Juicebox.  In this next duration I will be focused on generating leads in the non-profit fundraising space.\n\n\n**Frontend and Protocol Testing**\n\n\nThrough my onboarding continually am doing different reconfigurations and testing.  I offer suggestions to the Peel team and the protocol gurus.  I did extensive testing of the NFT rewards contract after a “call to action” from Jango - [https://discord.com/channels/775859454780244028/987105293810938007/1035196863755845652](https://discord.com/channels/775859454780244028/987105293810938007/1035196863755845652) \n\n\nMet with @Strath McKay to go over creation flow back in September.  Was able to go over the creation flow after it was initially created to give feedback.  \n\n\n## Risks\n\n\nI stop doing the work.\n\n\nAnother risk that I want to make the DAO aware of is that each project is in a different stage of development.  I try and work with people who have an MVP or at least a roadmap but not all projects are organized.\n\n\n## Timeline\n\n\nStart Funding Cycle #38.  End Funding Cycle #42\n\n\n\n---\n[Discussion Thread](https://discord.com/channels/775859454780244028/873248745771372584/1046884345069191168) | [IPFS](https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmNS5ay972DoWNMAvmT6vrJ4j2iMWU4FnpfmK9DPFfvKfd)",

      "content": "\n```text\nAuthor: filipv\nDate: 2022-11-28\n```\n\n\n## Thesis\n\n\nInstead of adding 1,205.31527829 ETH in the multisig to the v1 treasury balance, add 150 ETH to the v2 treasury to cover the DAO’s recurring payouts and add the remaining 1,055.31527829 ETH to the v3 treasury balance.\n\n\n## Motivation\n\n\n**The DAO’s v2 treasury does not currently hold enough ETH to fulfill the DAO’s FC#36 payout obligations. Contributors receiving a payout from the v2 treasury did not receive their full payout for this funding cycle, and will not receive the rest of their payout unless ETH is transferred from the multisig to the treasury.**\n\n\n[JBP-284](https://juicetool.xyz/snapshot/jbdao.eth/proposal/0x97c53018287a63f88c4905b52ddd55ad0833e25311d3b0b226989e37abdcdeb9) allocated 1,205.31527829 multisig ETH to the v1 treasury. If this ETH were deposited into the v1 treasury, it would generate 30.13 ETH in fees upon leaving the treasury, which would in turn erroneously issue 30.13 ETH worth of JBX to the reserved list and the multisig.\n\n\nThis would also make DAO operations more complex: the sooner that the DAO can fully migrate to its v3 treasury, the simpler the DAO’s operations will be. Adding these funds to the v3 treasury will allow the DAO to begin migrating payouts and other distributions to its v3 treasury sooner, reducing the future complexity of governance and multisig operations.\n\n\n## Specification\n\n\nInstead of adding 1,205.31527829 ETH to the v1 treasury’s balance, the multisig shall:\n1. Add 150 ETH to the DAO’s v2 treasury balance.\n2. Add the remaining 1,055.31527829 ETH to the DAO’s v3 treasury balance.\n\n\n## Rationale\n\n\nCalling the `addToBalanceOf` function will not mint any project tokens, meaning balances will be accurate.\n\n\n## Risks\n\n- The v1 contracts have held large amounts of ETH without any exploits or hacks. The v3 contracts might contain an exploit we are not yet aware of.\n- This change will make it more difficult to enable v3 redemptions in a timely manner.\n- These funds will not be available for redemption by v1 JBX holders until a v1 → v3 token migrator is deployed. This may take several months.\n\n## Timeline\n\n\nAdd 150 ETH to the DAO’s v2 treasury balance within 3 days of this proposal’s Snapshot ratification. The rest of the specification is to be executed within 36 days of this proposal’s Snapshot ratification.\n\n\n\n---\n[Discussion Thread](https://discord.com/channels/775859454780244028/873248745771372584/1046845330240581684) | [IPFS](https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmPCgTi7cR8JmtRWVHhGRbU8jmfuA62WQFbYJNeq7BJ7ar)",

      "content": "\n```text\nAuthor: matterturbulent\nDate: (2022-12-04)\n```\n\n\n## Synopsis\n\n\n![](https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/16a7eada-a444-45cd-9d65-38e7a9df933d/1_%281%29.png?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Content-Sha256=UNSIGNED-PAYLOAD&X-Amz-Credential=AKIAT73L2G45EIPT3X45%2F20221206%2Fus-west-2%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20221206T000030Z&X-Amz-Expires=3600&X-Amz-Signature=7a640f6b85b9b87ea6faa091e8540246019149d3be118856db27c44ff9a24b0f&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&x-id=GetObject)\n\n\n**E Pluribus Unum — Out of Many, One**\n\n\n15 Web3 groups (and counting) have come together to fundraise and bid on a private copy of the US Constitution going up for auction at Sotheby’s on December 13. This movement—called UnumDAO is the spiritual sequel to ConstitutionDAO, with many of the orgs being born from or inspired by the movement last year. We are utilizing the private multisig application Nucleo to obfuscate a portion of the donations to make our bid more competitive, and we plan to raise the remaining funds publicly on Juicebox. We’re prepared to show the world how far crypto has come in one year and to give our community and industry a positive signal. The goal is to start with the Constitution, and then continue acquiring important civic artifacts in order to create a “People’s Museum,” totally controlled by governance NFT holders, rotating to new locations, and educating the public about the history and innovations of democracy. \n\n\nWe are proud to partner with Juicebox given its status as the go-to decentralized platform for projects to raise funds in Web3. We are requesting a $150,000 USD grant from Juicebox at the initiation of the fundraise to seed it. Additionally, we want to use the holdFees flag to enable us to refund donors in full should we lose the auction.\n\n\nIf bid fails then all funds become refundable, including the grant. All donors have the opportunity to reclaim funds within a 30 day window. After the 30 day window UnumDAO gains ownership of the remaining the funds for use in acquisition, curation, and care of other civic artifacts. \n\n\n## Motivation\n\n\nThis proposal will cement the partnership between JuiceboxDAO and “ConstitutionDAO2,” while simultaneously kickstarting the fundraiser. We recognize that Juicebox plays an essential role in the ecosystem, championing the value of decentralization. Juicebox is an essential tooling in Web3 and unlocks the ability for regenerative projects to establish their governance communities. This proposal represents a middle ground between shutting off fees and leaving them as is. \n\n\n## Specification\n\n\n1) $150k distribution worth of ETH from the v1 treasury will go to the JuiceboxDAO multisig. The multisig will then pay the withdrawn amount to the ConstitutionDAO2 Juicebox treasury. The projectId is to be determined and will be explicitly specified by MatterTurbulent, the proposal submitter. \n\n\n2) Utilization of the holdFees flag will set aside fees but not immediately process them in the JuiceboxDAO treasury. Should the UnumDAO win the auction the fees will get processed. Should UnumDAO lose the auction then the fees will get sent to the ConstitutionDAO2 Juicebox treasury for 30 days allowing individuals to get a full refund. After the 30 days concludes and the refund ability closes, 2.5% of the remaining funds sill get sent to JuiceboxDAO treasury. The leftover stays in the ConstitutionDAO2 project treasury, for use by UnumDAO in the continuance of its mission. \n\n\n4) Vocal support from Juicebox as a partner in the movement.\n\n\n## Rationale\n\n\nSotheby’s valued the Constitution copy at $20 - $30 million USD. If Juicebox fees are 2.5% and gives the project fundraiser a $150,000 grant then the fundraiser has to raise at least $6 million for Juicebox fees to exceed the initial $150,000 put in.\n\n\n## Risks\n\n\nIf the fundraiser undershoots $6 million but still wins the Constitution in the auction then JuiceboxDAO will not receive more fees than the initial amount of the grant. \n\n\n## Timeline\n\n\nWithin the next couple of days the fundraiser will go live and JuiceboxDAO should make the 150k donation upon initiation of the fundraiser. Should UnumDAO lose the auction we expect to do the refund based on the reasonable timeline for such activity. All donors have the opportunity to reclaim their funds within the 30 day window. Throughout the auction leading up to Dec 13 the coalition will advocate for Web3 to once again come together and buy a Constitution. Except this time we will win. \n\n\n\n---\n[Discussion Thread](https://discord.com/channels/775859454780244028/873248745771372584/1048378419404083260) | [IPFS](https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmS4TixbgeixaVxu3RJ2FnJ9Qgw65gDxMv1czCX8mt2SQc)",

      "title": "JBP-307 - Fund blunt finance experiment",
      "content": "\n```text\nAuthor: jango.eth\nDate: (2022-12-02)\n```\n\n\n## Synopsis\n\n\n$35k to Blunt Finance jb project. \n\n\nJacopo has prototyped a fundraising-specific project bootstrapper that we’re calling [blunt.finance](http://blunt.finance), which lets projects automate some fundraising-specific parameters encoded into funding cycles. There’s a chance this project can evolve into being a core component of growth-oriented juiceboxe projects.  \n\n\n## Motivation\n\n\nThe technical purpose of Blunt finance is to experiment with creating fundraising-specific funding cycles, where:\n\n- a funding target can be specified. If not reached, a subsequent funding cycle is automatically configured to give contributors refunds. Else the project’s ownership is transferred to the rightful owner to be operated as any other juicebox project.\n- a funding cap can be specified. If reached, the fundraise will not accept more funds or issue more tokens.\n- all contributors during the funding cycle receive a share of a Slicer ([https://github.com/slice-so/contracts-core](https://github.com/slice-so/contracts-core)), which can have reserved token distributions routed to during future funding cycles. Slicers can include vesting properties.\n\nThe prototype is finished — see repo and README here [https://github.com/jbx-protocol/blunt-finance](https://github.com/jbx-protocol/blunt-finance), the prototype web app here [https://dev.blunt.finance/](https://dev.blunt.finance/) and dev logs here [https://astonishing-moss-f4f.notion.site/Dev-log-dcf7404ac3ca4159a68e4881cfbc36a5](https://astonishing-moss-f4f.notion.site/Dev-log-dcf7404ac3ca4159a68e4881cfbc36a5). Next moves are:\n\n1. to integrate into the workflow of prospective jb projects by working with JuiceboxDAO, Peel, and those contributors encouraging jb project creations.\n2. to help capital allocators in retail and VC better understand the Juicebox protocol and its affordances, attempting to create an appetite for moving more money through the protocol to ambitious projects and communities, while maintaining confidence and governance over the risk profile being assumed when doing so.\n3. to continue iterating on the technical specs of the extension given feedback on the prototype.\n\n## Specification\n\n\n$35k routed to Blunt finance project ID (TBD, will establish by 12/8).\n\n\nFunds will be used to pay dev stream (routed directly to those who submit PRs onto the Blunt finance Github repository, as managed by Jacopo) and possibly audits. We intend to keep much of the funds in the treasury for future spend on finding product market fit. \n\nAlongside this grant, the Blunt finance treasury will be open to fundraising from anyone else on the internet.\n\n\n## Rationale\n\n\nBlunt finance project will use its own protocol in its jb treasury. This is a great way to incentivize experimental network componentry development, and Jacopo and the Slice community have been alongside the Juicebox community for a long time.\n\n\nThe number is $35k because the DAO has been implicitly trying to figure out what happens when it moves $35k around to the network's edges with its grants to Studio DAO and Defifa.\n\n\n## Risks\n\n\nBlunt finance has execution risk. Though Blunt reduces the Juicebox protocol onboarding to fewer parameters hypothesized to make fundraising more approachable, there’s a chance introducing a new concept, contracts, and web domain confuses folks more than it helps.\n\nThere’s also a risk contributors reprioritize their time into more worthwhile endeavors. \n\n\n## Timeline\n\n\nNext gov cycle \n\n\n\n---\n[Discussion Thread](https://discord.com/channels/775859454780244028/873248745771372584/1048344022655189012) | [IPFS](https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmSuWEK165gmcrEzopFj1EEKk1j6upqtxBMZTZuAuUkKxG)",

      "content": "\nStatus: Draft\n\n\n```text\nAuthor: jango.eth\nDate: (2022-12-2)\n```\n\n\n## Synopsis\n\n\nThis proposal is to refund Jango for 952 DAI covering the DAO's Figma and Notion expenses.\n\n\n## Motivation\n\n\nJango used to pay for Figma and Notion expenses from a personal credit card, and submit retroactive payouts from the DAO for reimbursement. Jango has since passed on this responsibility to CogniDAO, but the DAO has not yet approved a proposal to fund CogniDAO to cover these liabilities. Jango has thus paid CogniDAO on the DAO's behalf to cover these expenses, including a 10% CogniDAO service fee. Jango will pay the 10% fee, and is asking only for the reimbursement only of the Figma and Notions invoices.\n\n\nThis proposal is in reaction to DAO not passing a proposal to fund CogniDAO for its expenses during the previous governance cycle. See [JBP-298](https://juicetool.xyz/snapshot/jbdao.eth/proposal/0xe7c5001043feb87f176d0f70bd31c16819dc44771ee68bec093e63bbc0bfec2a).\n\n\nCogniDAO thus feels in debt to JuiceboxDAO, and Jango has volunteered to fill the void.\n\n\nJango has previously been compensated retroactively for CC expenses on the DAO's behalf. See [JBP-236](https://juicetool.xyz/snapshot/jbdao.eth/proposal/0x70a706e6149aa8041fbb6f1cc820c7532b23ba289dff9e33f32fb207cc2d1736). This proposal should be treated similarly, while noting Jango has used CogniDAO as an intermediary.\n\n\nJango will also not ask for reimbursements in the future. If the DAO wishes to have a Figma and Notion account, it must figure out a way to pay for these through a service such as CogniDAO.\n\n\n## Specification\n\n\nConvert the DAO’s multisig ETH into 865 DAI sent to jango.eth from DAO's multisig.\n\n\n## Rationale\n\n\nIn the future, proposals of this nature are best addressed proactively instead of retroactively.\n\n\n## Risks\n\n\nThere's risk of continuing the standard for retroactive payments for services.\n\n\n## Timeline\n\n\nNext GC.\n\n\n\n---\n[Discussion Thread](https://discord.com/channels/775859454780244028/873248745771372584/1048331050662764604) | [IPFS](https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmbhnvKV1PNQZ6ej7ZPftWzMKTcSnKo45h78JLEaPrswSz)",

Contributors receiving a payout from the v2 treasury did not receive their full payout for this funding cycle, and will not receive the rest of their payout unless ETH is transferred from the multisig to the treasury.**\n\n\n[JBP-284](https://juicetool.xyz/snapshot/jbdao.eth/proposal/0x97c53018287a63f88c4905b52ddd55ad0833e25311d3b0b226989e37abdcdeb9) allocated 1,205.31527829 multisig ETH to the v1 treasury. If this ETH were deposited into the v1 treasury, it would generate 30.13 ETH in fees upon leaving the treasury, which would in turn erroneously issue 30.13 ETH worth of JBX to the reserved list and the multisig.\n\n\nThe proposal to [Reallocate ETH From v1 → v3](/4b9056d44d7b4a1080ca2682d72ffb56) attempts to solve this problem by reallocating that ETH to the v3 treasury. However, some community members may not want to add this ETH to the v3 treasury because:\n\n- It may take several months to deploy a v1 → v3 token migrator, meaning this ETH will not be available for redemption by v1 JBX token holders.\n- The DAO multisig and the v1 JuiceboxDAO treasury have both held large ETH balances for extended periods of time, giving confidence that the associated smart contracts are secure. The v3 treasury is not as “battle tested”.\n\nThis proposal is a middle ground for those community members. It prevents erroneous issuance of v1 JBX without preemptively depositing this ETH into the v3 treasury.\n\n\n## Specification\n\n\nIf the proposal to [Reallocate ETH From v1 → v3](/4b9056d44d7b4a1080ca2682d72ffb56) is not ratified by the DAO, revoke the following sentence from the Specification of [JBP-284](/a9cee4d520c845f9924a1278c211df1f):\n\n\n`Multisig to add the resulting ETH to the balance of the JuiceboxDAO v1 treasury.`\n\n\nand add 150 ETH to the DAO’s v2 treasury balance.\n\n\n## Rationale\n\n\nIf the DAO sufficiently supports the proposal to [Reallocate ETH From v1 → v3](/4b9056d44d7b4a1080ca2682d72ffb56), this proposal is no longer necessary.\n\n\n## Risks\n\n\nLeaving ETH in the multisig could be risky if there were any multisig collusion. By not adding this ETH to the v3 treasury, future DAO operations may be more complicated than they would otherwise be.\n\n\n## Timeline\n\n\n150 ETH to be added to the DAO’s v2 treasury balance within 2 days of this proposal’s Snapshot ratification. The remainder of this proposal’s specification is to be executed within 36 days of this proposal’s Snapshot ratification. If the proposal to [Reallocate ETH From v1 → v3](/4b9056d44d7b4a1080ca2682d72ffb56) is ratified, this proposal shall be considered revoked in its entirety.\n\n\n\n---\n[Discussion Thread](https://discord.com/channels/775859454780244028/873248745771372584/1046849860986474497) | [IPFS](https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmcZa9AnLAFHEg7KWg8U4cGmxCEb75B66PhZJ2xBitKnc8)",

The above Retool tool automatically syncs with CogniDAO’s banking partner and allows for transactions to be easily addable to the juicebox configuration flow. \n\n\nThe overall goal is for CogniDAO to be a self sustaining juicebox project. The project aims to provide 2 solutions;\n\n\n- Pay fiat expenses as an agency on behalf of the DAO\n- Provide a legal vendor for VAT based contributors\n\nThe current contribution in the specification can be thought of as funding this projects research and development with the end goal for the project to become self-sustaining.\n\n\n## Specification\n\n\n_How exactly will this be executed?

      "content": "\n```text\nAuthor: filipv\nDate: 2022-11-28\n```\n\n\n## Thesis\n\n\nUpdate the reserved list.\n\n\n## Motivation\n\n\n[**JBP-292 - Update Reserved Token Allocation; Reduce DAO Reserve**](https://juicetool.xyz/snapshot/jbdao.eth/proposal/0xd1f415648ce2ee72a907a59a1d7681d2814033bdf236a28f934233d0f1dad43f) was rejected by the DAO, meaning the reserve list still does not match the list of individuals currently contributing to the DAO.\n\n\nOne potential reason for JBP-292’s rejection was an decrease in the reserved allocation to the DAO. This proposal aims to update the reserved list while maintaining the DAO’s reserved allocation.\n\n\n## Specification\n\n\nFor all versions of the DAO’s projects:\n\n\nReserve 30% of JBX for `dao.jbx.eth` and evenly split the remaining 70% between:\n\n- burtula.eth\n- jmill.eth\n- jigglyjams.eth\n- 0xstvg.eth\n- 0x2DdA8dc2f67f1eB94b250CaEFAc9De16f70c5A51 (Viraz)\n- filipv.eth\n- zom-bae.eth\n- jb.daodevinc.eth\n- zhape.eth\n- peri.eth\n- drgorilla.eth\n- matthewbrooks.eth\n- jango.eth\n- sagekellyn.eth\n- felixander.eth\n- jb.0xba5ed.eth\n- wraeth.eth\n- twodam.eth\n- aeolian.eth\n- mieos.eth\n- johnnyd.eth\n- gulan.eth\n- brileigh.eth\n- strathmckay.eth\n- 0xblaz.eth\n\nAny “leftover” percentage which cannot be evenly divided shall be designated to dao.jbx.eth.\n\n\n## Summary\n\n\nAdded:\n\n- strathmckay.eth\n- 0xa13d49fCbf79EAF6A0a58cBDD3361422DB4eAfF1 (blaz)\n\nRemoved:\n\n- natasha-pankina.eth\n- zeugh.eth\n- tankbottoms.eth\n\n## Rationale\n\n\nThis specification largely matches the existing process, but has an up-to-date list of contributors.\n\n\n## Risks\n\n\nThis might not be the most effective use of reserved JBX. Many proposals to distribute the DAO’s reserved JBX have been rejected in the past.\n\n\n## Timeline\n\n\nTo be queued for the soonest funding cycle possible after this proposal’s Snapshot ratification.\n\n\n\n---\n[Discussion Thread](https://discord.com/channels/775859454780244028/873248745771372584/1046833500348756058) | [IPFS](https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmPa16jAzUn4P4Kb66QGGcxuNuRha6yLVZ9fWrZ2TawByN)",

Why now?_\n\n\nThere is still a lot to be done with the nance platform but juicebox has already paid a substantial amount for jigglyjams to develop it. This lower payout will be to finalize some dolt database managment items as well as jigglyjams efforts towards creating a juicebox native subscription system that nance and other similar projects can use. Once this subscription (simple smart contract + open dolt database, some more details [here](https://discord.com/channels/775859454780244028/955977240787685416/1033106157151207486)) is deployed, jigglyjams would like to use that system to receive smaller maintenance payments for the nance platform.\n\n\nThis payment will also go towards jigglyjams helping with multisig reconfigurations and maintenance.\n\n\n## Specification\n\n\n_How exactly will this be executed? Be specific and leave no ambiguity._\n\n\nAdd jigglyjam’s V2 juicebox project (id: 188) to the funding distribution of juicebox dao’s V2 treasury for the amount of $1,000 in ETH.\n\n\n## Rationale\n\n\n_Why is this specification appropriate?_\n\n\njigglyjams would like to decrease their payout in order to incentivize the search for other paying users of the nance platform.\n\n\n## Risks\n\n\n_What might go wrong?_\n\n\njigglyjams may fail to do this job. Mitigation: jigglyjams has been heavily involved over the past 6 months and very much enjoys this work and being apart of JB.\n\n\n## Timeline\n\n\n_When exactly should this proposal take effect?

JuiceboxDAO is committed to a [progressive migration to v3](https://juicebox.notion.site/Versioning-last-stretch-47c94118e2824d2494338d4bee6d8797), for both the DAO and the protocol. Adding this ETH to the v1 treasury would be counterproductive towards this goal.\n\n\n## Specification\n\n\nInstead of adding 1,205.31527829 ETH to the v1 treasury’s balance, the multisig shall add that ETH to the DAO’s v3 treasury balance.\n\n\n## Rationale\n\n\nNot only will this support progressive migration to the v3 treasury—it will add funds to the v3 treasury with which to manage future payouts.\n\n\n## Risks\n\n- This change will make it more difficult to enable v3 redemptions in a timely manner. These funds will not be available for v1 redemption.\n- The v1 contracts have held large amounts of ETH without any exploits or hacks.

I did a[ poll in the discord ](https://discord.com/channels/775859454780244028/879851197857677372/1041419136963727463)to check the sentiment regarding my contributions, 75% voted for me to increase my payout to $10k.\n\n\nSome of the things I have worked on since the previous proposal:\n\n- NFT-Rewards ([commits](https://github.com/jbx-protocol/juice-721-delegate/commits?author=xBA5ED))\n- JBX Protocol V3 ([commits](https://github.com/jbx-protocol/juice-contracts-v3/commits?author=xBA5ED))\n- Aztec connect bridge* ([commits](https://github.com/xBA5ED/juice-aztec-connect-bridges/commits/0xBA5ED/juicebox)) (WIP)\n- Ghost/private payer ([commits](https://github.com/jbx-protocol/juice-private-payer/pull/1/commits)) (WIP)\n\n* Allows for zero-knowledge private payments, redemptions and donations\n\n\nIn future FCs I would like to work on:\n\n- Finishing WIP extensions (Aztec, AppleJuice, Ghost payers etc.)\n- L2/Side-chain versions of Juicebox\n- Doing more research on/prototyping of standardising extensions\n- Various extensions for Juicebox (especially gasless payments and gas refunds)\n- Do more exploring regarding [JBFOSS](https://discord.com/channels/775859454780244028/876252266594721873/1034486197017378938)\n\nThe above are just some examples of things I would really like to work on, however I ofc can't do all of these in the next 6 FCs (one L2 version of Juicebox may take more than 6 FCs). I always try to work on what (I think) the DAO feels is the highest priority.\n\n\n## Specification\n\n\nFor the next 6 funding cycles pay (0xBA5ED) `0xb045708e396E20071324C1aed2E4CFB90A0764FE` $10,000 per funding cycle and keep him on the list of beneficiaries of reserved JBX.\n\n\n## Rationale\n\n\nSmart-contract developers are hard to hire because its new, niche and there is a high demand. 0xBA5ED is an experienced smart-contract developer and is comfortable with and has a good understanding of the Juicebox V3 codebase.\n\n\n## Risks\n\n- Reduced quality or less code shipped than before\n- 0xBA5ED could stop contributing\n\n## Timeline\n\n\nProposal will take effect immediately\n\n\n\n---\n[Discussion Thread](https://discord.com/channels/775859454780244028/873248745771372584/1043208729673351209) | [IPFS](https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmYzAxa9NnWwrs2mq8FWYUWEHCwVkf2rff5Nt5fXFikVgY)",

Although these ambiguities have not yet led to any conflict, our Governance Process should accurately reflect our day-to-day practices to avoid potential controversies.\n\n## Specification\n\n- Ratify this governance process: [https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmWkf5yW2gmhbdZoXTLxTDvMJNMFqBT5A8rD19EvVnjhyr](https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmWkf5yW2gmhbdZoXTLxTDvMJNMFqBT5A8rD19EvVnjhyr)\n\n- Update Governance Process at [https://info.juicebox.money/dao/process](https://info.juicebox.money/dao/process)\n\n- Update other documentation accordingly.\n\n- Follow the updated governance process.\n\n## Rationale\n\n- More recent proposals should take precedence as they are more likely to accurately represent the DAO’s present wishes.\n\n- Proposals which receive more affirmative votes should take precedence over proposals with lower engagement, as they are more likely to represent the wishes of the DAO.\n\n- The effective date of proposals should be clear to give executors confidence and prevent any misinterpretations.\n\n## Risks\n\nA controversial proposal with high engagement might take precedence over a less controversial proposal with lower engagement if they conflict and are approved in the same funding cycle.\n\n## Timeline\n\nThe updated governance process should take effect upon this proposal’s Snapshot approval.\n\n\n---\n[Discussion Thread](https://discord.com/channels/775859454780244028/873248745771372584/1037776890095738890) | [IPFS](https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmexQza3b3QNi8B2Hsb82pZvJDuRtz97L47qmVTs8SCLEw)",

I have been trying to keep the translated rate at at least 95% or higher at this interval.\n\n- I began to experiment with my Twitter account ([https://twitter.com/zhape1112](https://twitter.com/zhape1112)) to build some kind of outlet for Chinese contents about JuiceboxDAO:\n\n\t- to keep members posted of different stages of new proposals voting stages(temp check and Snapshot voting) every funding cycle, and provide short summaries to these proposals, hopefully to help boosting community involvement;\n\n\t- to help broadcasting some other activities of the DAO, e.g. the Audit Fund project NFT minting and JBX airdrop, so that CN members can choose to join if they wish.\n\n\t- to experiment sharing of our blogposts Chinese translations, by make a hashtag #Juicebox博客分享（#Juicebox blogs sharing）\n\n\t- to experiment the sharing of new projects on Juicebox by hashtag of #Juiceboxprojectssharing, explain what those project configurations can affect the potential contributors in an objective as possible way. No shilling.\n\n### What I am going to do：\n\nBasically I will keep on doing what I am doing right now, probably add or reduce some workload depending on the development of things.\n\n- Keep compiling Town Hall summaries, trying to improve it along the way. Sincerely hoping to get some feedback from people, esp. in the English version. \n\n- Be a responsible mod to the CN channels.\n\n- Keep working on Crowdin for the translation of our website.\n\n- If the DAO approves, I want to translate the rest of our blog posts in chronological order, and share them out on Twitter, or on some other website like Medium, Substack or Mirror by setting up a dedicated account for Chinese contents.\n\n- Keep sharing Juicebox related information in Chinese with my Twitter, though I don’t have too many followers, but some of the content can reach quite deep into our ecosystem with the retweets by our official account. \n\n- Any other work beneficiary to JuiceboxDAO.\n\n## Risks\n\nI am not as responsible for my job, or I fail to deliver what I promised.\n\n## Timeline\n\nIf approved, this proposal will take effect from FC #35, and end on FC#41. \n\n\n---\n[Discussion Thread](https://discord.com/channels/775859454780244028/873248745771372584/1037762918810386472) | [IPFS](https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmdhUeVs4bAFCHzHSBwQiaPQB37eXMJuWGRKM6fFXWc3Un)",

      "content": "\n```plain text\nAuthor: aeolian\nDate: (2022-11-04)\n```\n\n## Synopsis\n\nRenew Peel’s recurring payout at US$60,000 per funding cycle (FC). Peel is the team that builds and maintains juicebox.money.\n\n## Motivation\n\n[juicebox.money](http://juicebox.money) continues to be Juicebox’s gold-standard frontend. And Peel is the team behind it.\n\n**Some highlights since our last payout renewal:**\n\n- Implemented a mainnet-ready NFT Rewards (including subgraph support).\n\n- Shipped ground-up rework of the project creation experience.\n\n- Shipped a frontend for Juicebox V3, backwards-compatible with Juicebox V2 and V1 (including subgraph support).\n\n- Shipped a Safe UI to improve the multisig signer experience.\n\n- Implemented a V3 upgrade path for V2 projects (behind a feature flag, pending general availability).\n\n- Zero-to-one SEO improvements (proper link unfurling for projects, Google indexes projects, etc.).\n\n- Experimental projects like [juice-pay](https://twitter.com/aeolianeth/status/1566619754340970496).\n\n- A ton of smaller features, improvements and bug fixes.\n\n**Next up:**\n\n- **Lovable project discovery**: in an effort to increase payments, we want to get people contributing to more projects on JB. This means improved project searching, improved project share-ability, and more. User activity feeds, bookmarking and notifications are also on the cards.\n\n- **Over-optimize on mobile:** many people visit the site on their phone. Let’s make sure this is optimal. \n\n- **Improve project owner experience:** continued improvements to project creation, plus additional tools for project owners (for example, analytics, permissions).\n\n- **Multi-token funding.** Fund your Juicebox treasury with USDC, DAI, ETH, and more ([GitHub](https://github.com/jbx-protocol/juice-interface/issues/1438)). This continues to be on the horizon but will be prioritized with contract crew.\n\nPeel commits to owning and maintaining the following projects:\n\n- [juicebox.money](http://juicebox.money) and [goerli.juicebox.money.](http://goerli.juicebox.money)\n\n- [The Juicebox Subgraph](https://github.com/jbx-protocol/juice-subgraph), on TheGraph.\n\n- [juice-hooks](https://github.com/jbx-protocol/juice-hooks) - a React Hooks library for the Juicebox V2 protocol.\n\n- [juice-sdk](https://github.com/jbx-protocol/juice-sdk) - a Javascript SDK for the Juicebox V2 protocol.\n\nOther future Juicebox-related projects that require Peel’s involvement should be considered in a separate payout proposal.\n\n## Specification\n\nContinue payouts of  US$60,000 per FC to Peel (V1 project handle `@peel`).\n\n## Rationale\n\nA US$60,000 payout is unchanged from our last proposal. Here is a breakdown of how we are currently using these funds.\n\n> FTE = Full-time equivalent; IC = individual contributor; DRI = directly responsible individual\n\nOur current capacity is as follows (see [Juicebox funding distribution](https://www.juicebox.money/p/peel)):\n\n- 1 lead/DRI @ $14,000 per FC\n\n- 5 FTE ICs @ $9000 per FC\n\nBeyond this, Peel must budget for infrastructure including but not limited to Infura, Vercel, TheGraph, Pinata, and Fathom Analytics.\n\n---\n\nRelevant links:\n\n- Peel proposals: [https://github.com/peeldao/proposals/tree/main/proposals](https://github.com/peeldao/proposals/tree/main/proposals)\n\n- Peel ‘Proposals’ Discord channel: [https://discord.com/channels/939317843059679252/940041243491201055](https://discord.com/channels/939317843059679252/940041243491201055)\n\n## Risks\n\n- Peel doesn’t use funds effectively.\n\n- Peel’s projects don’t meet community expectations.\n\n## Timeline\n\nThis proposal should take effect in FC 35.\n\nPeel should be removed from recurring payouts from FC 42 (after six cycles), unless superseded by another proposal.\n\n\n---\n[Discussion Thread](https://discord.com/channels/775859454780244028/873248745771372584/1037857057199640628) | [IPFS](https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmTMhbp1SZHhjqpTaS8UF9zro3dBaRy69XDEoV2j2sGzhU)",

      "content": "\n```plain text\nAuthor: DrGorilla.eth#8862\nDate: 2022-11-04\n```\n\n## Synopsis\n\nRenew the recurring payout of DrGorilla.eth as contract engineer\n\n## Motivation\n\nPrevious renewal here for context: \n\n- Based on the previous renewal, I’ve met the following targets:\n\n\t- develop new treasury extensions: I have done a few ones of my todo list (NFT Reward mostly, I’ve helped a bit in Defifa but rather a marginal help tbh, various allocator, including the one mentioned in the below implementation) and still work on others\n\n\t- Find bugs: I’ve found quite a few ones (including _after_ NFT Reward Code4rena) while helping the effort to address the ones discovered by C4 wardens\n\n\t- Juicebox on L2/Sidechain: This is now designed as an allocator (for now) which still need to be build based on the swap allocator (Nomad being still recovering from its tragic hack)\n\n\t- Help integration of new juicy features, via discord, on a daily-ish basis\n\n\n- I’m offering to continue working on this new set of domains:\n\n\t- Pursuing extension development: first the swap allocator (swapping a given payout to another token → get paid in dai without having a dai terminal for instance) then the bridge allocator (bridging a payout to another chain). The swap one is almost done tested, the bridge should be fairly easy to implement\n\n\t- Juicebox on L2: When NFTReward/Defifa are shipped (which is now-ish), this will free some more time to deploy “somewhere else”\n\n\t- find bugs - always, then smash them - hard\n\n\t- Other project (mostly extensions) are listed in my todo (which I’m updating sometimes, kinda): [https://discord.com/channels/775859454780244028/786985806396784690/974974959560585256](https://discord.com/channels/775859454780244028/786985806396784690/974974959560585256)\n\n## Specification\n\nContinue the current scheme wihle modifying the recipient address: send 18500$ worth of ETH to the address resolved by exhausted-pigeon.eth (the parent company of DrGorilla.eth), each FC, for a total of 6FC, from the V2 treasury.\n\n<u>Upgradibility</u>: The target address might be updated to an allocator during this proposal’s life.\n\nTo avoid burdening the dao with a new vote to change the address, I suggest the following process, part of this proposal: “_DrGorilla.eth will transmit the new address in the multisig channel, for inclusion in the next funding cycle reconfiguration. This will be sent as a message signed by the DrGorilla.eth address private key. Upon verification of this signed message, the beneficiary addresses of DrGorilla in the payout group 1 (ETH payout) will be updated - the reserved address remains unchanged_”.\n\n## Rationale\n\n<u>Why keeping the ape?</u>\nI have been an active contributor in Juicebox for more than a year.\n\nI have been involved in designing and testing V2 and V3 as well as plenty of extensions, answering 2 audits, finding new bugs, addressing them,  developing new functionalities, processing code4arena contests, etc. I am at ease in Juicebox ecosystem code and mechanisms, which is much needed to safely ship additional features and to challenge the status quo when (imo) needed (including the bitmap mechanism in NFTReward, for a potentially huge gas saving, or the cloning pattern to avoid increasing the gas burden on users minting NFT). \n\n<u>Why keeping the payout unchanged?</u>\nAfter an informal contributor poll and a quick research (data easily available on Twitter, other DAO’s forums, Google), this salary is expected for a contract engineer with a similar experience level (I coded part of the NFTRewardDeployer in bytecode [https://github.com/drgorillamd/clone-deployed-contract](https://github.com/drgorillamd/clone-deployed-contract)).\nI’ve met previous objectives and have a set of updated ones of similar complexity.\n\n## Risks\n\nDrGorilla might disappear, stop producing quality code (potentially leading to a loss of treasury fund) or just start being an overall jerk.\n\n## Timeline\n\nImmediate effect\n\nProof of ownership: \nDrGorilla.eth current address signing the message (without “ ”): “exhausted-pigeon.eth”\n\n{\n\"address\": \"0x6860f1a0cf179ed93abd3739c7f6c8961a4eea3c\",\n\"msg\": \"0x6578686175737465642d706967656f6e2e657468\",\n\"sig\": \"7ca1922689acb24bbce0c7648db83b6d64d22081b2743e558572768cfbafbcd900475b0f97de69d7b469ebdf9dae89c2980a52408326bc41956cc01ee3f8e0fa01\",\n\"version\": \"3\",\n\"signer\": \"MEW\"\n}\n\n\n---\n[Discussion Thread](https://discord.com/channels/775859454780244028/873248745771372584/1038057677047210024) | [IPFS](https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmZtHLubiFNbhvRPhoooLB8nKsA9vYXws8yrLuK1dmEK1i)",

      "content": "\n```plain text\nAuthor: Lexicon Devils\nDate: (2022-11-04)\n```\n\n## Synopsis\n\nRenew and increase Lexicon Devils recurring payout to continue the Forming concert series as well as maintenance to the Voxels JBX HQ parcel.\n\n## Motivation\n\nFORMING is a virtual concert series ran by Lexicon Devils showcasing artists and how Juicebox protocol can be utilized to host events by transparently paying out musicians as well as contributors. As Forming matures as a presence in the metaverse, it has become clear more resources are needed to run a cohesive and consistent program. This proposal would insure the proper funds to payout the LD production crew to continue running the FORMING program as well as continuing to pay out the selected monthly artists. This would entice more artists, musicians and web3 communities to directly interact with Juicebox through Forming. We will continue to experiment with NFT rewards and other Juicebox features to further show how Juicebox can be used to manage any creative project. Creating content and tutorials that relate more directly to musicians and artists interested in web3 to make Forming, thus making Juicebox a platform for the “underground” of NFTs.\n\n## Specification\n\n$8350 USD into the Lexicon Devils Juicebox every two weeks for the next 6 FC’s\n\nPer FC budget:\n- $1750 to Forming\n- $6600 to Lexicon Devils Production Crew\n\n## Rationale\n\nHaving a dedicated fund going towards the arts, sponsoring cultural events strengthens the ties between artists & engineers, deepening the creative talent pool of not only the Juicebox ecosystem but Ethereum at large. Juicebox is a prime example of a DAO who sets the cultural tone, in touch with the current zeitgeist of crypto & DAOs. It’s a natural next step for the Lexicon Devils & Juicebox partnership to continue leading the scene in making creative spaces online for artists & engineers, a cultural scheilling point for a new era of the internet.\n\n## Risks\n\nLexicon Devils and FORMING audience fail to understand or adopt JBX. Bear market fud too dominant and crypto skepticism too great creating an uphill battle making expanding our outreach almost impossible. This would result in failure to provide impactful marketing creating greater Juicebox awareness, small turn outs, lackluster experiences, and minimal actual benefit to Juicebox protocol.\n\n## Timeline\n\nAs soon as snapshot passes.\n\n\n---\n[Discussion Thread](https://discord.com/channels/775859454780244028/873248745771372584/1038195366836838600) | [IPFS](https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmZtFYNyPoDss2pYopuCcY8Dy4RMGLtfsH9fhNsd4x578W)",

This will allow users to see queued reconfigurations and updated funding cycles in project activity feeds and other services. Ported all metadata unpacking libraries to AssemblyScript to allow funding cycle metadata to be viewed directly on the subgraph.\n\n### Frontend\n\n- [Implemented AddToBalance events](https://github.com/jbx-protocol/juice-interface/pull/2176) into the project event feed.\n\n- Created [juice-rss](https://github.com/filipvvv/juice-rss), an RSS notification service for Juicebox Projects. A live instance is available at [https://juice-rss.deno.dev](https://juice-rss.deno.dev). RSS is a popular notification service which can be used with IFTTT, Zapier, and other services to generate email notifications, Discord messages, or other integrations.\n\n### Documentation\n\n- Ongoing technical maintainence of the [juice-docs](https://github.com/jbx-protocol/juice-docs). This includes building the [new home page](https://info.juicebox.money/), implementing Algolia DocSearch, fixing bugs, package maintainence, and more.\n\n- Documenting NFT Rewards. This is a work in progress, and will be a focus for the next week or two. Current work is live on [https://info.juicebox.money](https://info.juicebox.money).\n\n- Creating guides and tutorials, including:\n\n\t- [**Launch a Custom Ethereum Treasury With Juicebox (CONFIGURATION GUIDE)**](https://youtu.be/kWxaFn4iwug) (~500 views).\n\n\t- [**Juicebox: Make an Ethereum Treasury and a Token in 5 Minutes**](https://youtu.be/pJszOKMxYNE) (~300 views)\n\n\t- Configuration guide at [https://info.juicebox.money/user](https://info.juicebox.money/user)\n\n\t- Guides for [Snapshot](https://info.juicebox.money/user/governance/snapshot), [Gnosis Safe](https://info.juicebox.money/user/governance/gnosis), and [Discord](https://info.juicebox.money/user/community/discord/dao/).\n\n### Community Alignment\n\n- Discord server management.\n\n- Webhook service for Discord announcements. Used for the first time yesterday.\n\n- “Community management” work. Answering questions, responding to inquiries, etc.\n\n- Running town halls in collaboration with @nicholas. Recordings, agendas, etc.\n\n- Maintaining Notion, including the proposals database (Notion janitor).\n\n- Maintaining DAO YouTube channel.\n\n### Bookkeeping\n\n- [juice-accountant](https://github.com/filipvvv/juice-accountant) automatically generates accounting CSVs for a [Juicebox](https://juicebox.money/)\n project: it retreives and processes token holders, payments, redemptions, and distributions, then generates CSV files with fiat conversions in the currency of your choice. This is helpful for any project creator that wants to do accounting or pay taxes.\n\n- [juice-fees](https://github.com/filipvvv/juice-fees) generates accounting CSVs for fees paid by every Juicebox project, with fiat conversions in the currency of your choice.\n\n- [safe-refunds](https://github.com/filipvvv/safe-refunds) generates a CSV of a Gnosis Safe's executed transactions, executors, and gas fees. This was created for calculating gas refunds for the Juicebox multisig, but can be used by any project creator (or anybody else) using a Gnosis Safe.\n\n- [Various accounting/bookkeeping work](https://github.com/filipvvv/juice-accounting) including a balance sheet and several other documents.\n\n### Miscellaneous\n\n- Various governance work, including an amendment for this funding cycle. Governance should be pretty stable at this point. Authored 51 proposals to date. Can hopefully taper this off over time as well.\n\n- Multisig work. Updating membership, queuing/verifying transactions, and other operations. @twodam does most of this.\n\n- Explored various fiat options. Not quite at fruition yet.\n\n- Helped several project creators. Discords, project configurations, marketing strategy, put them in touch with lawyers, etc.\n\n- Resolving various Etherscan verification issues.\n\n- Represented the DAO by speaking on several podcasts and events, including:\n\n\t- [**The Flexible Way to Fundraise for Your Next Web3 Project | Filip from Juicebox**](https://podcasts.apple.com/sk/podcast/the-flexible-way-to-fundraise-for-your-next-web3/id1614643326?i=1000581786444)\n\n\t- [**DAO News Report: July 20, 2022 – featuring Filip from Juicebox**](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/dao-news-report-july-20-2022-featuring-filip-from-juicebox/id1630815761?i=1000570565500)\n\n\t- **Internet of People Podcast (being released in December)**\n\n\t- DAOPlanet NYC\n\n\t- Several Twitter spaces\n\n- Good deal of work on this [legal tool](https://daolabs-docs.on.fleek.co/legal/intro/start.md) for Juicebox projects. Not done yet. The intro section is good though, I will move it to the project creator docs. Pretty insane time committment on this one.\n\n- Work on [DAO Terms of Service](https://info.juicebox.money/tos).\n\n## Upcoming Priorities\n\n- Finish documenting NFT rewards.\n\n- Learn Dune.\n\n- Project configure and init in frontend.\n\n- Get fiat payments working for JBM.\n\n- Better notification services.\n\n- Upgrade project search (and maybe indexing).\n\n- Continue other projects above.\n\n- Start closing down Notion.\n\n- Revamp project creator docs. Wiki style.\n\n- Focus on project creator tooling and distribution.\n\nAlso potentially interested in onboarding experience on juicebox.money—looking at [Metamask onboarding library](https://docs.metamask.io/guide/onboarding-library.html).\n\n## Specification\n\nIncrease the distribution from the DAO’s v2 treasury to filipv from 6,000 USD/FC to 6,500 USD/FC.\n\n## Risks\n\nThe funds might be better utilized elsewhere.\n\n## Timeline\n\nUpdate this payout in the first funding cycle after this proposal is ratified on Snapshot. Remove this payout in FC#42.\n\n\n---\n[Discussion Thread](https://discord.com/channels/775859454780244028/873248745771372584/1038240325472366612) | [IPFS](https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmdbbVtcsP5T3TTUHx17b3fdcDC1FC3XxD6Ua6zbR8wRgs)",

Contributors which would have otherwise stewarded such a process are no longer active Juicebox contributors. Juicebox should aim to resolve any outstanding governance proposals.\n\n## Specification\n\n- Multisig to unwrap 1,205.31527829 wETH in exchange for ETH.\n\n- Multisig to add the resulting ETH to the balance of the JuiceboxDAO v1 treasury.\n\n- Revoke the entirety of JBP-186 - Launch Treasury Management.\n\n## Rationale\n\nJuiceboxDAO’s v2 and forthcoming v3 treasury do not have the balances necessary to support redemption (and as such have redemption disabled). Until a v1 -> v2/3 token migration can take place, the DAO should concentrate the majority of its ETH in its v1 treasury to support redemption.\n\n## Risks\n\nRevoking this proposal leaves the DAO with no clear plan for treasury management, which leaves the DAO with high exposure to ETH (and its volatility).\n\n## Timeline\n\nEffective upon this proposal’s passing. To be executed within the following 30 days.\n\n\n---\n[Discussion Thread](https://discord.com/channels/775859454780244028/873248745771372584/1037776889537904700) | [IPFS](https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmZ358oXUmMbcCbKj2TL6M9p774oTFY5kqBes4sKMgAE2S)",

Thirsty Thirsty’s [Tier 1 Membership NFT](https://thirstythirsty-nft.herokuapp.com/) costs 0.4 ETH, meaning the DAO purchased **19 memberships**—none of which have been distributed.\n\nEach membership comes with:\n\n- 1 bottle of Collector Pinot Noir EXCLUSIVE to Thirsty Thirsty, made by Phelan Farm (Rajat Parr) + NFT art by Marleigh Culver as the wine label.\n\n- Launch Party access to Thirsty Thirsty’s NFT NYC lunch.\n\n- VIP Winery access.\n\n- Digital workshops and healings.\n\n- Future TT event access/member benefits for NFT holders.\n\n- Fine art NFT by Marleigh Culver.\n\n- VIP dining access at top restaurants.\n\n- VIP Private Chef access.\n\n- First access to TT travel experiences (ex: Harvest Experience, Ceremony in Amazonas).\n\n## Specification\n\nOne membership NFT each to:\n\n- Sage\n\n- Zom\n\n- Felixander\n\n- Jigglyjams\n\n- Burtula\n\n- 0xSTVG\n\n- Kenbot\n\n- Rakelle\n\n- filipv\n\n- …\n\nAny remaining memberships should be distributed to the DAO multisig for future use.\n\n## Rationale\n\nThe DAO should roughly prioritize:\n\n- Contributors who could not come to DevCon.\n\n- Community members who could not come to DevCon.\n\n- Contributors who went to DevCon.\n\n- Community members who went to DevCon.\n\n- Random anons.\n\n## Risks\n\nThese memberships might be more effectively utilized in the future or in a different way (e.g. prizes in a competition, donated to charity, and so on).\n\n## Timeline\n\nIf possible: to be distributed once Thirsty Thirsty has Juicebox NFT rewards.\n\nOtherwise, to be distributed within 90 days of this proposal’s Snapshot ratification.\n\n\n---\n[Discussion Thread](https://discord.com/channels/775859454780244028/873248745771372584/1037776890489995386) | [IPFS](https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmfPovtaS1B6ehHkUYUVNS5JaSdFio3wwhGrdWVW6hBe74)",

      "content": "\n## Synopsis\n\nRenew and increase Matthew and Brileigh’s recurring payout to continue producing high quality content including The Juicecast, Juicenews, articles on the JB blog, and YouTube videos.\n\n## Motivation\n\nJuicebox needs to continue developing content creation strategies in order to improve visibility, attract new project creators, and drive protocol growth. The best way to achieve this is through informative storytelling centered around projects being built on Juicebox, leveraging the network effect of successful JB projects while educating and inspiring new project creators.\n\nWe are a DAO content duo with experience producing web3 native content for orgs such as RAW DAO, JuiceboxDAO, and NounsDAO. Our contributions have helped build brand awareness, community, and engagement through fresh, original content that doesn’t feel too corporate. Matthew’s precision and attention to detail is balanced out by Brileigh’s speed and energy, allowing them to work together to hold each other accountable and keep the juice flowing.\n\n### Recent work\n\n🎙 [The Juicecast](https://anchor.fm/thejuicecast) is a cultural anthropology of Juicebox featuring interviews with community members building and maintaining projects using the protocol. We are responsible for all production tasks from interview prep, scheduling guests, co-hosting, editing, audio engineering, and Twitter campaigns.\n\nHere are the episodes that we have recently published:\n\n🎬 [Kenny from StudioDAO](https://anchor.fm/thejuicecast/episodes/Ep--9---Kenny-from-StudioDAO-e1mhmv7)\n\n🃏 [Sean from JokeDAO](https://anchor.fm/thejuicecast/episodes/Ep--12---David-Phelps-from-JokeDAO-e1p7oq6)\n\n🤽🏾 [Steve from Marin County Swim Association](https://anchor.fm/thejuicecast/episodes/Ep--11---Steve-from-Marin-County-Swim-Association-e1oet1l/a-a8n8de1)\n\n🗳️ [David Phelps from JokeDAO](https://anchor.fm/thejuicecast/episodes/Ep--12---David-Phelps-from-JokeDAO-e1p7oq6)\n\nEpisodes that have been recorded and not yet published:\n\n🍰 Jacopo from [Slice](https://slice.so/)\n\n📜 Five guests (so far) for the ConstitutionDAO deep dive multi-part retrospective podcast\n\nWe’ve started cross-posting podcast content as custom 4k waveform visualizers to [JBDAO YouTube ](https://www.youtube.com/c/JuiceboxDAO)for better visibility and searchability, helping us to better leverage the network effect of guests who appear on the podcast:\n\n![Custom 4k visualizer for Juicecast episode 7](https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/070de5e7-993c-4b2e-9339-aae7591075d9/MoonDAOVisualizer.gif?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Content-Sha256=UNSIGNED-PAYLOAD&X-Amz-Credential=AKIAT73L2G45EIPT3X45%2F20221025%2Fus-west-2%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20221025T001815Z&X-Amz-Expires=3600&X-Amz-Signature=36c45976b71f26af22800e95bcf35393b9a9bdb8eb1ac31d867b58bfd5854184&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&x-id=GetObject)\n\nWe’ve also recently started embedding chapter metadata into episodes to help listeners navigate to timestamps more easily in supported applications (e.g. Apple Podcasts, Overcast).\n\nIn addition to the audio Juicecast, we have recently started recording video interviews with high-profile guests to help bring new audiences into the Juicebox ecosystem:\n\n- [Bottom-up governance and the Guild + JokeDAO + Juicebox modular stack with David Phelps](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_29qSArUz8&t=3s)\n\n- The creator economy and how web3 is falling short with Robin Schmidt (SuperMassive)\n\n![The creator economy and how web3 is falling short with Robin Schmidt (SuperMassive)](https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/5d41c3a1-24f2-4970-a3a2-41cbb4c665ba/SuperMassive-still.png?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Content-Sha256=UNSIGNED-PAYLOAD&X-Amz-Credential=AKIAT73L2G45EIPT3X45%2F20221025%2Fus-west-2%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20221025T001815Z&X-Amz-Expires=3600&X-Amz-Signature=e441b3d87880aa1e0983e366605df9d0381ba635debdeba0eb37318fa3e23b70&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&x-id=GetObject)\n\n✍🏻 In addition to the [Juicecast](https://anchor.fm/thejuicecast), we have contributed to the [JB blog](https://info.juicebox.money/blog) by writing about projects as case studies of what can be successfully built on Juicebox. These articles have been paired with configuration how-to articles to give new project creators a concise breakdown of how past projects were configured and inspire them to create projects with similar structures. Our goal with these articles is also to give project creators space to talk about their work while helping them achieve better visibility.\n\nWritten content that we have published on the JB blog:\n\n🚀 [MoonDAO, a worldwide collective decentralizing space exploration and research](https://info.juicebox.money/blog/2022-10-11-moondao)\n\n🌜 [How MoonDAO was configured on Juicebox](https://info.juicebox.money/blog/2022-10-18-moondao-config)\n\n🧊 [Lexicon Devils, A Metaverse Architecture Guild Running on Juicebox](https://info.juicebox.money/blog/2022-07-14-lexicon-devils/)\n\n🏗 [How Lexicon Devils is configured on Juicebox](https://info.juicebox.money/blog/2022-09-27-lexicon-devils-config)\n\n🎸 [How FORMING is configured on Juicebox](https://info.juicebox.money/blog/2022-10-04-forming-config)\n\n🎞 [StudioDAO, A Decentralized Movie Studio Flipping the Script on Funding Films](https://info.juicebox.money/blog/2022-09-07-studiodao)\n\n🎬 [How StudioDAO and its sub-projects are configured on Juicebox](https://info.juicebox.money/blog/2022-09-20-studiodao-config)\n\n📰 EXTRA, EXTRA! In August we launched [Juicenews](https://juicenews.beehiiv.com/), a weekly newsletter capturing all of the juicy goodness that JBDAO contributors bring to the ecosystem including recent podcast and blog articles, video tutorials, governance recaps, and town hall summaries.\n\n### Upcoming work\n\n🎙️ We’ll continue co-hosting and producing [The Juicecast](https://anchor.fm/thejuicecast) as a storytelling vehicle for projects and communities built on the protocol. Here are a few episodes that we have in the pipeline:\n\n📜 A retrospective deep dive series on ConstitutionDAO (3+ episodes)\n\n🎸 FORMING, a hyper-verse concert series by Lexicon Devils\n\n🍊 The frontend wizards of Peel managing a DAOified product team on Juicebox\n\n🕹 How G-Play Studios is making P2E GameFi more competitive and addicting \n\n🌐 Metaverse interoperability with Jin from OpenVoxels\n\n✍🏻 Alongside [The Juicecast](https://anchor.fm/thejuicecast), we’ll continue writing long-form content on the [JB blog](https://info.juicebox.money/blog) that uplifts projects, leverages their communities to spread the JB meme, and demonstrates clear use cases for the protocol. Here are a few articles that we have in the pipeline:\n\n📜 A ConstitutionDAO post-mortem: the story behind raising $42M on Juicebox + config article\n\n🎨 TileDAO: a community-owned NFT project built on Juicebox + config article\n\n🍰 Slice: a decentralized commerce protocol running on Juicebox + config article\n\n🍊 PeelDAO, a DAOified product team building and running on Juicebox + config article\n\n🗞️ We’ll continue editing and publishing a weekly edition of [Juicenews](https://juicenews.beehiiv.com/), web3’s juiciest newsletter jam-packed with recent podcast and blog articles, video tutorials, governance recaps, protocol updates, and town hall summaries.\n\n## Specification\n\nAdd $3000 USD recurring payout from FC#34 to FC#40 to matthewbrooks.eth from the v2 treasury\n\nAdd $3000 USD recurring payout from FC#34 to FC#40 to brileigh.eth from the v2 treasury\n\nOnce v3 is live on mainnet, Brileigh and Matthew will create a JB project and inform the bookkeeper to transfer this payout to the project instead of the addresses listed above.\n\n## Rationale**:**\n\nWe are proposing an increased recurring payout to reflect the added workload and output that has emerged over the last seven funding cycles. Since the start of our previous recurring payout, we have built up a comprehensive content strategy and are asking for JBDAO’s support to continue bringing greater visibility to the Juicebox ecosystem. \n\n## **Timeline:**\n\nThis proposal should take effect immediately, starting in FC#34 and ending in FC#40.\n\n\n---\n[Discussion Thread](https://discord.com/channels/775859454780244028/873248745771372584/1033143716283678851) | [IPFS](https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmQXBcyGa9yBUKs2MsHhoficmfifoqv97CtPZRzfkSsVL5)",

      "title": "JBP-278 - Renew Felixander’s Recurring Payout",
      "content": "\nAuthor: Felixander\nDate: 2022-10-24\n\n## Thesis:\n\nRenew Felixander’s recurring payout of $3,000 per funding cycle, concluding at FC#41.\n\n## Abstract:\n\nJuicebox has produced excellent content in the past several months that it didn’t have before. Due to the addition of new content creators since my time starting here, we are in the amazing position of regularly having high-quality and informative content being produced and shipped. An area where content creation is lacking, however, is around building the bannyverse brand and characters, and forging partnerships, artistic and otherwise, to drive distribution of the amazing content that we regularly produce. I will build out the bannyverse to grow artistically rich and off the wall, and will create partnerships that both build our brand as well as bring readers and hopefully project creators into our ecosystem.\n\n## Motivation:\n\nThis recurring payout renewal will allow Felixander to work on these projects with 100% of his energy.\n\n## Risks:\n\nMe not delivering on the work, me not securing partnerships or building the brand, me moving to Hawaii and drinking pina coladas rather than responding to discord messages.\n\n## Specification:\n\nExtend Felixander’s payout for seven more funding cycles, expiring at FC#41.\n\n## Rationale & examples of work:\n\nIn the previous recurring payout period, I have delivered a lot of content ranging from project profiles, project configuration guides, zany artistic banny stuff like the comic I made in conjunction with Burtula, some short fiction, and some short audio files profiling projects. A list of all of my work this past payout period can be found [here](/4cbccc86206842a192c9cea87370e755). (Still happy and plan to produce content like this from time to time btw, just refocusing my role to where I can make greater impact.)\n\nWith this proposal I will pivot my energy to lean heavily into two areas I’m passionate about: artistic expression in bannyverse and driving distribution by forging partnerships with other communities, which is currently a critical need at JB. By producing excellent bannyverse content, and building out the bannyverse in ways that grab attention, and are just downright awesome, we can build the banny brand and drive eyeballs to JB. Examples of this include but are not limited to creating a bannyverse short fiction series, producing more comics and art in partnership with ComicsDAO and other web3 organizations, creating NFT sale opportunities of bannyverse lore/bannies, and creating hype around the bannyverse and banny as a mascot, dropping sick memes, and so on. In this vein I have already made some headway, creating the banny comic with Burtula (edition 2 is in the works, and edition 1 will be featured as a ComicsDAO ad page), and manning the banny twitter, who has been bouncing around the twittersphere for the last few weeks. I’ve also produced a number of banny memes, and look forward to making them even more ridiculous as time goes on. I’m also keen on a bannyverse advent calendar via nouns-style NFT banny sale, and I’ve got a ton of other ideas that I can’t wait to pursue and bring to fruition. The goal of this, beyond simply creating amazing art, is also to bring people into the JB ecosystem, where they can access our community and our amazing content and newsletter. On the distribution side I also plan to reach out to other orgs and media to hype projects, like defifa, to try to generate press and engagement for JB.\n\n## Gratitude:\n\nPutting my efforts into more artistic and forging-partnerships directions is a dream come true for me. Feeling like the DAO has my back and entrusts me with such an important role means a lot to me. The open and honest feedback from you all in temp check means a lot to me, too. I can’t tell you how happy I am to move in this direction should the DAO support me on this, and how seriously I am committed to growing JB and the bannyverse. Thank you all for your support!\n\n\n---\n[Discussion Thread](https://discord.com/channels/775859454780244028/873248745771372584/1033044667698262096) | [IPFS](https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmTEmnxNyWCNM2Z7pq7hxXDom9S1ppzDtRbMytJnCcgJGq)",

Further success relies on maintaining highly involved multisig membership.\n\n```plain text\nSigning frequencies for the last 61 transactions:\n(filipv)      0xDc6D...9651                         61\n(Dr. Gorilla) drgorilla.eth, 0x6860...Ea3c          58\n(twodam)      jbx.twodam.eth, 0xD782...21b8         56\n(seanmc)      seanmc.eth, 0xc109...cC94             54\n(johnnyd)     johnnyd.eth, 0xf0FE...abAd            52\n(zeugh)       zeugh.eth, 0xf725...0041              50\n(dhyon)       0xA0Ba...c77c                         46\n(jango)       jango.eth, 0x823b...ADAD              43\n(mieos)       mieos.eth, 0xe787...EFd1              41\n(tankbottoms) 0x468f...7409                         39\n(Peri)        peri.eth, 0x63A2...5834               24\n(aeolian)     aeolian.eth, 0xE16a...357B            17\n(Austin)      jbx.austingriffith.eth, 0xAd69...fb15  4\n(Gulan)       gulan.eth, 0xF828...BAea               3\n(Aaron)       0x352e...2D09                          0\n```\n\n## Specification\n\nConduct a weighted Snapshot vote with the following options:\n\n- No\n\n- Abstain\n\n- 0x123a3c28eb9e701c173d3a73412489f3554f3005 (jmill)\n\n- 0x25910143c255828f623786f46fe9a8941b7983bb (jigglyjams)\n\n- 0x468f178672C86bFA02e5E1B0413C3ccf55A37409 (tankbottoms)\n\n- 0x2DdA8dc2f67f1eB94b250CaEFAc9De16f70c5A51 (Viraz)\n\n- 0x5706d5ad7a68bf8692bd341234be44ca7bf2f654 (Zhape)\n\n- 0x63A2368F4B509438ca90186cb1C15156713D5834 (peri)\n\n- 0x679d87d8640e66778c3419d164998e720d7495f6 (pmoncada)\n\n- 0x6860f1A0cF179eD93ABd3739c7f6c8961A4EEa3c (Dr. Gorilla)\n\n- 0x823b92d6a4b2AED4b15675c7917c9f922ea8ADAD (jango)\n\n- 0xA0Ba480a2222bB18c010f97144cFb9A687a8c77c (Dhyon)\n\n- 0xAd69cDE6AFB7Ca67BcAbD033962b5D45cfedfb15 (Austin Griffith)\n\n- 0xb045708e396E20071324C1aed2E4CFB90A0764FE (0xBA5ED)\n\n- 0xc109636a2b47f8b290cc134dd446Fcd7d7e0cC94 (seanmc)\n\n- 0xD78285eef93E13D1F96062265b68099C480121b8 (twodam)\n\n- 0xDc6Dd6Bc601448541A4862a91De1B86291839651 (filipv)\n\n- 0xE16a238d207B9ac8B419C7A866b0De013c73357B (Aeolian)\n\n- 0xe7879a2D05dBA966Fcca34EE9C3F99eEe7eDEFd1 (mieos)\n\n- 0xf0FE43a75Ff248FD2E75D33fa1ebde71c6d1abAd (JohnnyD)\n\n- 0xF8284136B169213E4c50cE09f3E1D9A9b484BAea (Gulan)\n\nAny vote other than a “no” or an “abstain” will be counted as a “yes” for standard governance purposes. If this proposal passes, multisig ownership will be transferred to the 14 volunteers which receive the most votes. If the proposal passes and fewer than 14 volunteers have received votes, only those who have received votes will be included on the multisig. The threshold shall at all times remain at the lowest possible number greater than the total number of multisig owner accounts times 0.6.\n\nAddresses listed in this proposal are not binding. Prospective multisig signers may designate another address which they prefer to the one listed herein.\n\nNote that current multisig members 0x352e85EC1b6c1D422AD868A2b2f3151ED2B12D09 (Aaron Wright) and 0xf7253A0E87E39d2cD6365919D4a3D56D431D0041 (Zeugh) are not included in this list.\n\n## Rationale\n\nA weighted vote allows for the multisig’s updated makeup to reflect the will of the community.\n\n## Risks\n\nThese individuals may inherit certain risks associated with being on the multisig. There might be many new multisig members. It may take time for them to adapt. Updated configurations will have to be queued quickly to allow for signing. Safe does not allow for the addition or removal of more than one member in a given transaction.\n\n## Timeline\n\nThe multsig’s membership shall be fully updated no later than four weeks after this proposal’s passing.\n\n\n---\n[Discussion Thread](https://discord.com/channels/775859454780244028/873248745771372584/1028073713394008124) | [IPFS](https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmduNYKK3LeVzfycqEFNrZCXfBkWpo7aXckgN5QRUJyqdt)",

      "content": "\n```plain text\nAuthor: jango\nDate: 2022-10-07\n```\n\n## Thesis\n\nVersioning strategy work, extensions roll-outs, and JBX strengthening and operational convergence with our v3 treasury are necessary projects. They are delicate however, and  successful implementations are more likely when attended to by folks who have full context of their technical, financial, and social implications. The DAO should renew jango’s recurring payout to continue researching and developing these efforts.\n\n## Motivation\n\nRight now we're at the climax of operational overhead due to versioning stuff. The work now is to reduce it all back down to our v3 treasury, creating stability for developers building projects and extensions, and for the JBX token.\n\n## Specification\n\nContinue payouts of $21k per FC to project #55 from the Juicebox DAO’s v2 treasury until Jango launches a V3 treasury for project #55 and Juicebox DAO has funded its v3 treasury sufficiently (≥$100k) to fulfill this commitment. At that time, Jango will let the bookkeeper know to remove the payout to project #55 from Juicebox DAO’s v2 treasury and add it to the v3 treasury. \n\n## Rationale\n\nJango wants to experiment moving project #55’s main treasury to V3 ASAP.\n\n## Risks\n\nIt’s a lot of money that could be better spent elsewhere, or kept in reserves to spend at later times.\n\n## Timeline\n\nImplement this payout as soon as possible, and remove this payout 90 days from this proposal’s passing.\n\n\n---\n[Discussion Thread](https://discord.com/channels/775859454780244028/873248745771372584/1028061881618923590) | [IPFS](https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmV7iGPAhXMm61t9VAbei9i6qsJFPyxxYS7Cxn51n6b5X4)",

      "content": "\n```plain text\nAuthor: Dr. Gorilla\nDate: 2022-09-29\n```\n\n## Synopsis\n\nClaim the $SAFE token (the governance token of Safe, prev Gnosis Safe) from the multisig & delegate the voting power to a JuiceboxDAO contributor\n\n## Motivation\n\nThe airdrop is claimable until the 27th December 2022 and consist of 2 parts: 3817.86 imediately redeemed and 3817.3 vested over the 4 next years.\n\nWhile the future value of $SAFE is unknown, the governance role it entails is key for the ecosystem. This airdrop would then be used to vote on future governance process. To avoid multisig burden, the voting power would be delegated, while claiming, to [0xBA5ED](https://www.notion.so/4f50b0a2c585420ea3b4a373b152dad2) (who’s already a registered delegate).\n\n## Specification\n\nUsing the $SAFE claiming app in the multisig, claim the first airdrop part and delegate the whole voting power to 0xBA5ED\n\n## Rationale\n\nClaiming an airdrop has one financial and two non-financial costs:\n\n- Financial: gas used, which should be less than the potential airdrop gross value (important to note the airdrop is non-transferable for an initial period, the $safe balance would therefore be stuck in the multisig).\n\n- Non-financial:\n\n\t- Adding a risk: it is a contract interaction, with the multiple vectors it implies. Doing so from the Safe frontend, via the built-in official app is a way to reduce the attack surface (ie similar to every interaction we do every FC)\n\n\t- Voting burden: reading proposals, debating, forming one own opinion on various topic, for such an important tool, is time- and mental ressources-consuming. It therefore requires some type of giga-brain as 0xBA5ED is. \n\n## Risks\n\nsmall operational/contract risk (care must be taken for every contract interaction arising from the multisig, regardless of the target)\n\n“voting power risk” as 0xBA5ED would be the only representative. This should be discussed during temp check, as multiple delegate is an option to mitigate this risk, or a governing process might be built if the DAO wants to express a vote for every Safe proposals (a delegation system should still be kept, as to not clog the Dao Safe multisig).\n\n## Timeline\n\nasap\n\n\n---\n[Discussion Thread](https://discord.com/channels/775859454780244028/873248745771372584/1025558290056355881) | [IPFS](https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmYnw4HoG7fQt7cdGfkNVcy5GXuaRrwhDNCM68eTdUzEEp)",

(Unincorporated Nonprofit Association) is designed, and operated by StudioDAO, Backlot LLC. but is 100% owned by its members.\n\nThis structure allows us to create a crypto-native DAO with a scoped down governance pipeline that wraps JB V3 into an appealing UX and value prop for filmmakers and fans. And importantly allows the DAO to launch with a true fair drop for this new format of creative collective.\n\nStudioDAO innovates in the following areas to accomplish this:\n\n\t- NFT based membership in StudioDAO, unifying multiple sub-communities across Juicebox entry points\n\n\t- DAO Approval of Juicebox configurations as defined by CSV templates enforces Network rules.\n\n\t- Contractual relationships with Filmmakers that deliver backend participation in community funded films. Revenue is deposited in the U.N.A.’s juicebox and funds the U.N.A.’s Green-light grants, creating a regenerative loop of filmmaking and film distribution revenue.\n\n\t- DAO structure that supports on-chain and IRL activity, with a path to true decentralization.\n\n\t- A carefully defined feature set that supports global participation via NFT Rewards.\n\n\t- StudioDAO is unique in its approach to utilize the Juicebox protocol for long term community development, operation while building the potential for fully autonomous DAOs in the future.\n\n## **Motivation**\n\nStudioDAO’s trajectory as a carefully incubated project is gaining momentum, and is in need of resources to continue to build and launch.\n\nStudioDAO is preparing for launch rapidly after the availability of NFT Rewards. We have completed the design/UX for our MVP at[ ](https://www.figma.com/proto/eB8zIMdEEevyx5bxwMGtIK/%F0%9F%8E%AC-StudioDAO-MVP-Sketches?node-id=510%3A4639&scaling=scale-down-width&page-id=468%3A4030&starting-point-node-id=510%3A4639)\n\n[https://www.figma.com/proto/eB8zIMdEEevyx5bxwMGtIK/🎬-StudioDAO-MVP-Sketches?node-id=510%3A4639&scaling=scale-down-width&page-id=468%3A4030&starting-point-node-id=510%3A4639](https://www.figma.com/proto/eB8zIMdEEevyx5bxwMGtIK/%F0%9F%8E%AC-StudioDAO-MVP-Sketches?node-id=510%3A4639&scaling=scale-down-width&page-id=468%3A4030&starting-point-node-id=510%3A4639)\n\nBacklot will be implementing that for launch in sync with the launch of V3 on Goerli.\n\nThese essential steps have been backed by a prior JBDAO x StudioDAO proposal.\n\n## Next Steps\n\nStudioDAO’s team is planning the next steps to launching a highly integrated app that coordinates filmmakers and fans in a productive, fun, regenerative DAO with multiple reasons to return often and engage.\n\nKey next steps for launch of the DAO include:\n\n- Integrate snapshot voting to allocate regular green-light treasury grants into studiodao.xyz\n\n- Integrate NFT Reward purchase, display and utility into[ studiodao.xyz](http://studiodao.xyz/) and collaborate with Peel to develop a new JB primitive that ALL NFT rewards project owners can use to develop engaged and decentralized communities.\n\n- Complete the connection of real world contractual relationships to our on–chain community and membership\n\n- Expand our on-boarding efforts to test and grow our network effects\n\n- Celebrate our first season filmmakers properly\n\n- Showcase JB V3 and generate excitement with its broad and creative appeal.\n\n## **Specification**\n\nStudioDAO needs support to iterate our MVP, integrate NFT sales and token based governance on site, expand the DAOs first slate of films and begin to manage the value and power of the DAOs green-light treasury.\n\nOur initial output is very efficient and demonstrates the massive latent power of the Juicebox X StudioDAO collaboration\n\nStudioDAO requests an additional $30,000 to elevate our effort and maintain our momentum\n\n\t- 5K for continued Front End development\n\n\t- 5K for continued UX development\n\n\t- 5K to support expanded filmmaker launch slate (current plan is 4 films ready to launch in first 2-4 weeks of operation)\n\n\t- 15K to complete legal contracts development, and financial operations needed to on-board filmmakers responsibly.\n\nIf the proposal passes, JuiceboxDAO will payout $30k to StudioDAO.eth to support these efforts.\n\nAny leftover funds in the treasury after the execution of these steps will be used to support the StudioDAO mission.\n\n## Funding the Green-light treasury\n\nDuring this FC we will plan for a larger proposal that can cold start the expanded slate we anticipate in November.\n\nMany interesting use cases emerge for token driven allocation of treasuries, we will engage the JB DAO broadly in this effort to determine road map and drive towards fully decentralized processes that capitalize on JB V3s expanded capabilities\n\n## **Rationale**\n\nStudioDAO is utilizing Juicebox to create a groundbreaking entertainment experience that empowers film fans like never before.\n\nStudioDAO demonstrates long term, real world value creation and a use case for Juicebox that will onboard 1000s of influential new users including the filmmakers who are ready to bring the DAO to life.\n\n## **Risks**\n\nThis project is complex. Technical, legal, operational or creative issues may limit our ability to execute and successfully launch StudioDAO.\n\n## **Timeline**\n\nNow\n\n\n---\n[Discussion Thread](https://discord.com/channels/775859454780244028/873248745771372584/1027996172410953789) | [IPFS](https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmcvREzTZDCXE25D1Qcf8vXRA6mHfnTgwyjMK1FcugqGug)",

      "content": "\n```plain text\nAuthor: jigglyjams\nDate: 2022-10-06\n```\n\n## Synopsis\n\n_What’s the idea?_\n\nRenew recurring payout to jigglyjams at $5,000 per cycle for 4 cycles (a total of $20,000)\n\n## Motivation\n\n_What problem does this solve? Why now?_ \n\nGovernance automation is essential to the long lasting success of Juicebox. The nance project has made major strides in automating juicebox DAO’s governance but there is still more work to be done. Just in the past few weeks twodam and jigglyjams have been heavily collaborating on building a stand alone tool for juicebox governance (see alpha [https://juicetool.xyz/nance/juicebox](https://juicetool.xyz/nance/juicebox)). This helps clarify to proposal submitters what fields are necessary for proposal submission and helps automate payout proposal configurations.\n\nThe amount of time that high payout members of the DAO are doing low level tedious work is still much too high. Automatic reconfigurations of both the V2 and V3 treasury have been successfully performed by nance, saving a lot of time and headache for multisig members. The configuration of the V1 treasury is still very tedious and must be automated to prevent unintended costly mistakes.\n\n## Specification\n\n_How exactly will this be executed? Be specific and leave no ambiguity._ \n\nAdd jigglyjam’s V2 juicebox project (id: 188) to the funding distribution of juicebox dao’s v2 treasury for the amount of $5,000 in ETH\n\n## Rationale\n\n_Why is this specification appropriate?_\n\nSince jigglyjam’s first recurring payout proposal (JBP-221) the following things have been accomplished:\n\n- Automatic translations of proposals during voting phase using deepl API and storage in GitHub (see [https://github.com/jigglyjams/juicebox-governance/tree/main/GC32/translation/zh](https://github.com/jigglyjams/juicebox-governance/tree/main/GC32/translation/zh))\n\n- Backup of proposals and voting results in GitHub (see [https://github.com/jigglyjams/juicebox-governance/blob/main/DATABASE.md](https://github.com/jigglyjams/juicebox-governance/blob/main/DATABASE.md))\n\n- Adding columns to notion db that support payout routing information\n\n- Automatic Gnosis transaction queuing of payout reconfigurations for JB treasuries V2 & V3 (this saves the multisig signers a lot of time!)\n\n- Many bug fixes and overall tightening of the notion → discord → snapshot flow of information\n\n- **gnance.eth has submitted 86 proposals to snapshot** and many more to discord\n\n- jigglyjams has assisted peeldao by contributing to the juice-sdk’s (see [https://github.com/jbx-protocol/juice-sdk-v3/pull/1](https://github.com/jbx-protocol/juice-sdk-v3/pull/1))\n\n- jigglyjams has assisted in the great herding of the multisig\n\nWith the continuation of jigglyjam’s recurring payout the following tasks are to be accomplished:\n\n- Automatic configuration of V1 treasury - _jigglyjams will collaborate with twodam to make this a great experience for the DAO and multisig members_\n\n- Automatic synchronization of all JB’s juicebox treasuries\n\n- Migrate away from notion - jigglyjams plans to slowly migrate juicebox off of notion as a proposal storage system. A prototype is still in need of building but jigglyjams plans on using dolt (git for sql databases) to version and store the governance database. Initially juicetool will submit proposals to both notion and the new governance storage system, when the new system is fully running and the dao is comfortable with its abilities we will shut off the connections to notion.\n\n- Make nance more accessible to other juicebox projects - the ease that nance provides to juicebox dao will attract other daos to the platform. Accomplishing the task above (migration off of notion) with twodam and juicetool will be a major catalyst to expand to other juicebox projects\n\n- Stats on the number of proposals that have passed through nance\n\n## Risks\n\n_What might go wrong?_\n\njigglyjams may fail to do this job. _Mitigation:_ jigglyjams has been heavily involved over the past 5 months and very much enjoys this work and being apart of JB\n\n## Timeline\n\n_When exactly should this proposal take effect? When exactly should this proposal end?_ \n\nThis proposal shall take effect in the GC#33 reconfiguration and remain until GC#36\n\n\n---\n[Discussion Thread](https://discord.com/channels/775859454780244028/873248745771372584/1027956900106621018) | [IPFS](https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmaniFgTi1cp18nJ1xokDtfs5znmnFQUJAr35CJZvZR713)",

      "title": "JBP-272 - Fund the NFT Rewards Smart Contract Audit",
      "content": "\nStatus: Discussion\n\n```plain text\nAuthor: Nicholas\nDate: (2022-10-04)\n```\n\n## Synopsis\n\nSend $73.8k worth of ETH to the [NFT Rewards Audit Fund](https://juicebox.money/@auditfund) Juicebox project, which is fundraising for a Code4rena audit of the NFT Rewards Contracts that will cost $72k, plus 2.5% in JB fees, for a total of $73.8k. \n\nFund a JBX distribution of 3 million JBX to be divided between donors to the Audit Fund before the fundraising deadline (approx. Oct 17).  \n\nThis proposal would also serve as a pilot integration of Juicebox and Code4rena, who have asked how they might use Juicebox Protocol to allow anyone to fundraise for C4A smart contract audits.\n\n## Motivation\n\nThe NFT Rewards contracts are complex and deeply integrated with the Juicebox Protocol's various affordance, allowing features such as tiered NFT rewards, NFTs that are a claim on overflow, and NFT governance tokens that can directly control Juicebox projects in onchain governance. While NFT Rewards are only attached to a given JBP Funding Cycle, it would be best if the contracts are free of bugs and vulnerabilities.\n\nIn recent weeks, C4A reached out to Nicholas to ask how they could use JBP to permissionlessly create fundraising pools for any protocol or smart contract on Ethereum. Their goal is to enable anyone to donate to an audit pool, which can be spent on C4A code contests. They have observed that many DAOs want to audit each other for technical dependency vigilance. Individual stakeholders, users, and observers of smart contracts may also want to pitch in to fund an audit, without supporting the whole cost of the audits alone.\n\nThis proposal is part of a pilot project to move this integration partnership forward via measured experimentation on mainnet. The [NFT Rewards Audit Fund](https://juicebox.money/@auditfund) is a JB project raising funds to pay for the NFT Rewards contracts audit. It is accepting donations from the public. The goal is to raise $73.8K, then disperse the funds as DAI to C4A to kick off the NFT Rewards audit contest. If JBDAO supports the present proposal, then it will put $73.8k back into the treasury without generating any new tokens (`addToBalance()`). If this proposal passes, donors to the initial fundraise will be able to redeem their tokens to receive a refund for their original donation — courtesy JBDAO, who will have picked up the bill.\n\nTo kick off the contest on Oct 18, C4A needs to receive the funds by Oct 17. In order to incentivize supporters of the NFT Rewards audit fund in advance of this deadline, if this proposal is approved, JBDAO will distribute 3 million JBX (1.4% of JBDAO’s current JBX position) to donors who pay the project before Oct 17 16:00 UTC. 1 million JBX will be split evenly between wallets that donated within each of the `>0.1 to < 1eth`, `>1eth to <10eth`, and `>10eth` tiers. This incentivizes larger donors who will share the JBX incentive with fewer fellow tier members.\n\nThis experiment allows us to locate and solve roadblocks in the rollout of a JBP x C4A integration partnership. These are being actively documented and discussed in [Discord](https://discord.com/channels/775859454780244028/1024114191419834468). This project will simultaneously get NFT Rewards audited by C4A, the protocol devs' preferred auditing solution of late, AND contribute to a genuine experiment that pushes partnership discussions forward and identifies and creates solutions to problems along the way. For instance, DrGorilla is [writing an allocator](https://github.com/jbx-protocol/juice-extensions-collection/blob/4f54fdcb47a8e8c152c4970af0c2fcf07dff10b5/contracts/Allocator/example/swapAllocator/SwapAllocator.sol), which will allow any JB Project to do payouts in DAI, because C4A requires that contests be funded in stablecoins. Note: This particular feature may or may not ship in time for the NFT Rewards audit.\n\n## Specification\n\nPay $73.8k from JBDAO v1 to 0x6052faf32b26edbbcfadb5527654e458fe7c0e35 (v2/256 project payer that does not mint tokens)\n\nSend 3 million JBX from the multisig to safe.auditfund.eth. Nicholas, Jango, and the JB multisig will coordinate to make the tokens available to eligible addresses according to the donation tiers described above.\n\n## Rationale\n\nThis is a project payer address that points funds at @auditfund (v2 project 256) without minting any new tokens. This will allow the v1 JBDAO treasury to pay the v2 @auditfund.\n\n## Risks\n\nProject 256 could be misconfigured and the redemption could somehow go not as planned. Partnership talks could also evaporate.\n\n## Timeline\n\nAdded to current cycle payouts on JBDAO v1 and v2.\n\n\n---\n[Discussion Thread](https://discord.com/channels/775859454780244028/873248745771372584/1026966074907951144) | [IPFS](https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmPNynXqw4mAea35eQpGW9EgduN9PFc1MX89vtr33eypWh)",

Ecosystem conditions have evolved significantly, meaning this original plan may no longer be as applicable.\n\n## Specification\n\n- Revoke [JBP-186: Launch Treasury Management](https://snapshot.org/#/jbdao.eth/proposal/0xfce85632456d2cb91cd8361c0f79707de7a4ef4608912ab0d01c9d8abb5619d5).\n\nMultisig to:\n\n- Swap 400 wETH for Lido stETH.\n\n- Swap 400 wETH for Rocket Pool rETH.\n\n- Swap 422.33 wETH for Maker DAI\n\nThis specification shall utilize wETH already in the multisig—not treasury ETH.\n\n## Rationale\n\n- stETH and rETH are relatively decentralized yield-bearing assets with high liquidity and volume locked.\n\n- DAI is a relatively decentralized stablecoin with high liquidity and volume locked.\n\n## Risks\n\nJuicebox DAO will inherit risks inherent to stETH, rETH, DAI; as well as their communities, market fluctuations, and their smart contracts and any vulnerabilities therein. Juicebox DAO may also miss out on upside of its current portfolio (almost entirely ETH).\n\n## Timeline\n\nThe swapping timeline and strategy shall take place at the discretion of the DAO’s multisig signers.

      "title": "JBP-268 - StudioDAO MVP launch grant",
      "content": "\n```plain text\nAuthor:Kenbot.eth\nDate: (2022-9-22)\n```\n\n## Synopsis\n\nJuiceboxDAO helps people confidently run programmable and community funded treasuries from startup to scale, openly on Ethereum. \n\nTo fulfill on this mission JuiceboxDAO should support the development of experimental DAOs built using Juicebox protocol primitives.\n\nStudioDAO is an experiential media collective that intends to grow into the first million person green-light committee.\n\nStudioDAO enables a future where the production of ambitious creative projects is limited only by our ability to build and share value in a coordination platform inhabited by a million true fans.\n\nStudioDAO innovates in the following areas to accomplish this:\n\n- NFT based membership in StudioDAO, unifying multiple sub-communities across Juicebox entry points.\n\n- DAO Approval of Juicebox configurations as defined by CSV templates enforces Network rules.\n\n- Contractual relationships with Filmmakers that deliver backend participation in community funded films. Revenue is deposited in the U.N.A.’s juicebox and funds the U.N.A.’s Green-light grants, creating a regenerative loop of filmmaking and film distribution revenue.\n\n- DAO structure that supports on-chain and IRL activity, with a path to true decentralization.\n\n- A carefully defined feature set that supports global participation.\n\n- StudioDAO utilizes the Juicebox protocol for long term community development and operation.\n\n## Motivation\n\nStudioDAO is preparing for launch rapidly after the availability of NFT Rewards.\n\nWe have V.01 of our MVP at [http://app.studiodao.xyz](http://app.studiodao.xyz/) which aggregates your ticket balance from juiceboxes that are a part of the studiodao network on rinkeby.\n\nThe MVP user journey is described[ ](https://www.notion.so/Defifa-8644f449958e4d9bb632cb5a46708fb6)in this [figma](https://www.figma.com/file/GIRjhdz7wh64XUAaQee5kp/MVP-Product-Journey?node-id=0%3A1).\n\nThis effort will show a new use case for Juicebox. Creating a meta-community with a long term proposition incorporatIng Juicebox token generation from a diversity of sources into a single community, and the connection of real world contractual relationships to this on–chain community.\n\nThe visibility of the creatives who are prepared to participate will also bring attention to the innovation of the juicebox platform and community. Our first filmmakers are ready to begin their adventure with StudioDAO & Juicebox as soon as we can launch the MVP.\n\n## Specification\n\nStudioDAO needs support to complete our MVP, launch our first films and begin to operate community governance of the green-light treasury.\n\nOne immediate need is for a dedicated front-end developer to clean up the current app and to lead the development of an opinionated StudioDAO UX.  This opinionated UX will integrate Juicebox NFT sales and the Green-light treasury snapshot components into a single experience.\n\nThis work will happen in coordination with efforts at Peel and JB as mutually agreeable.\n\nStudioDAO requests $35,000 to support this effort.\n\n- 20,000 to support the development of the MVP\n\n\t- 5K for front end development\n\n\t- 5K for UX development\n\n\t- 5K for Filmmaker NFT Rewards GTM efforts\n\n\t- 5K for Filmmaker Pipeline Development\n\n- 15,000 to fund the Green-light treasury\n\n\t- Enable our regenerative loop to operate for our earliest members\n\nAs soon as the StudioDAO U.N.A. Juicebox is deployed, JuiceboxDAO will payout $35k to the StudioDAO U.N.A. Juicebox, generating Green-light Power for JBDAO to participate in StudioDAO U.N.A. governance.\n\nAny leftover funds in the treasury after the MVP launch will be used to support the StudioDAO mission.\n\n## Rationale\n\nStudioDAO is utilizing Juicebox to create a groundbreaking entertainment experience that empowers film fans like never before. StudioDAO demonstrates long term, real world value creation and a use case for Juicebox that will onboard 1000s of influential new users including the filmmakers who are ready to bring the DAO to life.\n\n## Risks\n\nThis project is complex. Technical, legal, operational or creative issues may limit our ability to execute and successfully launch StudioDAO.\n\n## Timeline\n\nNow. \n\n\n---\n[Discussion Thread](https://discord.com/channels/775859454780244028/873248745771372584/1022718642493865984) | [IPFS](https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmXgWj6QdU4C9TekzvxbonSc9kE4Thgvi8fycccn4F25Qj)",

The purpose of Movement has been clarified: to facilitate non-profit entities. The development group with which I work has formalized DAOLABS, a for-profit development company building on-chain tools for either non-profit or for-profit activities. DAOLABS is building a core ‘treasury’ application, which is powered by the Juicebox Protocol. Its other applications include NFT tooling, accounting, and crypto on- and off-ramps. The revenue model is not finalized; however, access to the application will likely be predicated on holding a JB project NFT, or being involved with Juicebox-related governance. The Juicebox Protocol, as well as its brand and community, is and will continue to be an important part of our tooling.\n\n\t### [JBP-157 - One-time payout to dao-lawfirm.eth](https://snapshot.org/#/jbdao.eth/proposal/0x335de9498378f42516408abf6a9379b61cc202b03d02be06793ba9c8021801e9)\n\n\tWhile no funds were provided to me, I did champion this activity, and as such, am responsible for an update. The DAO paid the first $20,000 to the firm. I requested the second $20,000 be retained by the DAO. The legal documents procured for the [Legal Tool site](https://daolabs-docs.on.fleek.co/) are well valued beyond $20,000. I personally paid the firm out of pocket for these documents.\n\n\tThe law firm delivered a draft opinion regarding the Banny character and its proposed uses: See [Opinion Letter Regarding Use of Banny](https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmT9kMS7kfzHnTjXSgZCzfcJMSnTrCB1nqnPoSf1XpKdSj/ex/Juicebox-Opinion-Letter-Banny.pdf).\n\n\tThe law firm also delivered a draft [privacy policy](https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmT9kMS7kfzHnTjXSgZCzfcJMSnTrCB1nqnPoSf1XpKdSj/ex/20220522-Privacy-Policy.pdf), which was predominantly legal boilerplate and was not particularly useful for Juicebox, due to the fact that the Juicebox Protocol previously stored no personal information, and after adding Fathom analytics, anonymizes all personal information. The privacy policy from Fathom was and is sufficient.\n\n\tThe core activity was to research, create, and distribute an opinion letter regarding the JB mechanics. A [Draft Opinion Letter Regarding Securities](https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmT9kMS7kfzHnTjXSgZCzfcJMSnTrCB1nqnPoSf1XpKdSj/ex/Opinion-Letter-No-Attribution.pdf) was created; however, the Juicebox Protocol mechanics are complex, and without an internal cryptocurrency expert (the Law firm’s usual advisor was unavailable), the draft did not correctly articulate Juicebox mechanics and how they relate to securities. Moreover, I underestimated the amount of time which would be required for an individual to provide technical information, to re-articulate the mechanics, and to provide edits/feedback on the draft. In the end, I intended for JB to be provided with actionable “do”s and “don’t”s instead of the usual “this is what the law says and doesn’t say, and where it doesn’t say it, do nothing”. As a result of the senior legal time spent researching and articulating the dimensions of securities infrastructure, I decided that surveying existing DAO-securities-cryptocurrency approaches and providing a succinct solution would be productive.\n\n\t### [JBP-227 - Renew tankbottom’s recurring payout](https://snapshot.org/#/jbdao.eth/proposal/0xed90329c4a99a238f9d3582bac701cb93bc24a4ed9d235bf80a3814ea9c43dc4)\n\n\tThe following activities were promised to be orchestrated or developed by me on July 15, 2022:\n\n\t**1. Continued design and UX work regarding additional features for the Juicebox application.**\n\n\tNatasha Pankina has continued to design JB-related application features within [Figma](https://bit.ly/3BJ32R4). Many aspects of additional on-chain utility and governance features for DAOs have been explored. A full-parity [Juicebox front-end application has been implemented in Svelte](https://github.com/DAOLABS-WTF/juice-interface-svelte), as well as a streamlined [Juicebox project page](https://github.com/tankbottoms/tiles-wtf-gallery).\n\n\tAdditionally, an [Accounting tool](https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmT9kMS7kfzHnTjXSgZCzfcJMSnTrCB1nqnPoSf1XpKdSj/accounting-walkthrough.mov) has been created.\n\n\tSvelte is compiled, smaller, and faster than ever (with the newly released SvelteKit). Apple uses Svelte for their [Apple music beta website](https://www.reddit.com/r/sveltejs/comments/v7ic2s/apple_beta_music_uses_svelte/).\n\n\t**2. Continued development of NFT tooling both UX and Cloud Functions.**\n\n\t- [NFT Creation Workflow](https://daolabs-nft-tooling.on.fleek.co/) - [Select Create Token](https://daolabs-nft-tooling.on.fleek.co/user)\n\n\t- [Cloud functions to support rich NFT creation](https://github.com/DAOLABS-WTF/juice-interface-svelte/tree/main/functions/src/routes)\n\n\t- [Zora-style quick Edition mint](https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmT9kMS7kfzHnTjXSgZCzfcJMSnTrCB1nqnPoSf1XpKdSj/edition-workflow.mov)\n\n\t- [NFT creation - Image workflow](https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmT9kMS7kfzHnTjXSgZCzfcJMSnTrCB1nqnPoSf1XpKdSj/image-workflow.mov)\n\n\t- [NFT creation - Music workflow](https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmT9kMS7kfzHnTjXSgZCzfcJMSnTrCB1nqnPoSf1XpKdSj/music-workflow.mov)\n\n\t- [NFT creation - Video workflow](https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmT9kMS7kfzHnTjXSgZCzfcJMSnTrCB1nqnPoSf1XpKdSj/video-walkthrough.mov)\n\n\t- [NFT creation - p5.js workflow](https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmT9kMS7kfzHnTjXSgZCzfcJMSnTrCB1nqnPoSf1XpKdSj/p5.js-walkthrough.mov)\n\n\t- [NFT creation - PFP workflow](https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmT9kMS7kfzHnTjXSgZCzfcJMSnTrCB1nqnPoSf1XpKdSj/pfp-example.mp4) - note the assets for each layers are mixed SVG and PNG files - @cookieslayer is a total Stacy\n\n\t**3. Continued development of NFT; multi-token treasury smart contracts.**\n\n\t- [NFT extension contracts](https://github.com/DAOLABS-WTF/juice-contracts-v3/tree/feat/extensions/contracts/extensions)\n\n\t- [DAI Treasury delegate](https://github.com/DAOLABS-WTF/juice-contracts-v3/tree/feat/extensions/contracts/extensions)\n\n\t- [Juicebox Typescript Update](https://github.com/jbx-protocol/juice-contracts-v3/compare/main...DAOLABS-WTF:juice-contracts-v3:main)\n\n\t**4. Continued development of 3rd party payment processing service for Juicebox contributions (to result in a new treasury for fiat onramp fees).**\n\n\tThe [New Wallet component](https://identity-develop.web.app/) supports BOLT and Wyre credit card processing and cryptocurrency BETA on-ramps. It also hosts other crypto-wallet features, such as:\n\n\t- Multi-party computation (Shamir’s) for seed/private key online storage;\n\n\t- user backup strategies via QR codes and camera scanning;\n\n\t- alternative sign-in strategies using Google, Github, Username and Password, and SMS;\n\n\t- support for both n seed phrases, derivation of any of the n seed phrase (yay, totally), and private key importing accounts; and,\n\n\t- Gnosis Safe management.\n\n\t**5. Continued development of Legal Resources online documents and materials.**\n\n\tThe creation of a [legal template generation tool for Juicebox](https://legal.juicebox.wtf/) with over $20,000 of legal agreements includes support for [UNAs](https://legal.juicebox.wtf/legal/unas/README.md), [WA/DE LLCs](https://legal.juicebox.wtf/legal/llcs/README.md), [C-Corporations](https://legal.juicebox.wtf/legal/ccorp/README.md), [Trusts](https://legal.juicebox.wtf/legal/trusts/README.md), and other structures.\n\n\tThe website includes Juicebox Project creator help pages for [Project Planning](https://legal.juicebox.wtf/legal/intro/project.md), a [Legal Primer](https://legal.juicebox.wtf/legal/intro/primer.md), a [For-profit guide](https://legal.juicebox.wtf/legal/intro/for-profit.md), [a Non-profit guide](https://legal.juicebox.wtf/legal/intro/non-profit.md), and a bonus [Securities overview](https://legal.juicebox.wtf/legal/intro/securities.md).\n\n\t**6. Continued development of on-chain Banny for veBanny and Bannyverse - https://app.bannyverse.xyz for the Bannyverse application.**\n\n\t- [veBanny on-chain contracts](https://github.com/tankbottoms/vebanny-bannyverse-on-chain/tree/csc-auction/solidity/contracts), and [veBanny and BannyVerse on-chain assets](https://github.com/tankbottoms/vebanny-bannyverse-on-chain)\n\n\t- veBanny Token detail viewable [here](https://vebanny-token.on.fleek.co/?banny=20&lock=5), and complete character grid [here](https://vebanny-token.on.fleek.co/secret.html) and [on-chain font generation of lock periods, demonstrable](https://vebanny-token.on.fleek.co/backgrounds.html)\n\n\t- [BannyVerse source code](https://github.com/tankbottoms/bannyverse-app), viewable [here](https://app.bannyverse.xyz/)\n\n\t**7. Continued support of legal opinion, agreements and other legal documents for the DAO, and for its members.**\n\n\t- See [Legal-Tools](https://legal.juicebox.wtf/)\n\n\t- Previously delivered, July 18th, 2022: [Juicebox TOS](https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmT9kMS7kfzHnTjXSgZCzfcJMSnTrCB1nqnPoSf1XpKdSj/ex/terms-of-service.md)\n\n\t**8. Bonus Activities**\n\n\t- [Tiles.wtf](https://github.com/tankbottoms/tiles-wtf-gallery) - currently [minting](https://tiles.wtf/dao?network=mainnet) all previous OG Tiles owners on a new contract, then minting new v2 mints. see [Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/address/0x8a97426c1a720a45b8d69e974631f01f1168232b)\n\n\t- The following accounting letter has been distributed to various accounting firms as a precursor to an evaluation meeting (or prepaid senior accountant meeting): [Juicebox Memo](https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmT9kMS7kfzHnTjXSgZCzfcJMSnTrCB1nqnPoSf1XpKdSj/ex/20220916%20DAOLABS-Accounting-Privacy.pdf). In summary, the accounting of funds contributed to JBX via specific routes (i.e. project member protocol fee vs. directly to Juicebox for JBX) may be accounted for differently. The assessment of the type of entity (setting aside the fallacy that no-entity is exempt from laws) types determines the treatment of accounting for the funds currently held in the protocol or multisig. The goal is to understand what methods I may use to account for and compute an estimated tax liability. To that end the following [accountants](https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmT9kMS7kfzHnTjXSgZCzfcJMSnTrCB1nqnPoSf1XpKdSj/ex/20220922-DAOLABS-Professional-Services-CPA-Tracker.pdf) have been contacted.\n\n\t- The goal is compute the liabilities as if Juicebox was legally recognized as a 501(c)3 - Public Good, and thus entitled to prepare a [F990](https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmT9kMS7kfzHnTjXSgZCzfcJMSnTrCB1nqnPoSf1XpKdSj/ex/20220916-DAOLABS-Accounting-Privacy-f990-2.pdf) so that a DAO proposal would be prepared with specificity to minimize conjecture and assumptions. [KelliWorks](https://www.kelliworks.com/about) is interested and we are meeting on September 27, 2022 face to face to discuss.\n\n\t_Obviously, the above was the combined effort of everyone I work with a DAOLABS, and @filipv for endlessly editing legal docs._\n\n## Specification\n\n- Remove the [JuiceboxDAO v1](https://juicebox.money/p/juicebox) payout to tankbottoms.eth [`0x5d95baEBB8412AD827287240A5c281E3bB30d27E`](https://etherscan.io/address/0x5d95baebb8412ad827287240a5c281e3bb30d27e)\n\n## Rationale\n\n- Removing this payout will reduce the amount of funds being paid out from the DAO treasury.\n\n## Risks\n\n- This is a large payout.\n\n## Timeline\n\n- As soon as the proposal is ratified.\n\n\n---\n[Discussion Thread](https://discord.com/channels/775859454780244028/873248745771372584/1022986530379288616) | [IPFS](https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmZoT8tVZeN19MRmvE7UiJVvLe4d2SqVLeVdAHZqcQhJwd)",

      "content": "\n```plain text\nAuthor: gulan\nDate: (2022-09-25)\n```\n\n## Synopsis\n\n_State what the proposal does in one sentence._\n\nTransfer treasury funds from v1 treasury to v2 treasury to cover ongoing payouts from the v2 treasury.\n\n## Motivation\n\n_What problem does this solve? Why now?_ \n\nThe v2 treasury was initially funded by JBP-210 with $200,000 USD in eth and has continued to collect fees and contributions. The expenditures have exceeded the income from fees and contribution and a new top off is required. This proposal will transfer an additional $200,000 USD.\n\nAdditionally, with the great progress of Naunce by @jigglyjams, Juicebox’s funding cycle configurations are automatically created for v2, and thus Juicebox governance has an incentive to move as many payouts from v1 to v2 as possible. It can be argued that we should transfer more than $200,000. Let me know in the discussion.\n\n## Specification\n\n_How exactly will this be executed? Be specific and leave no ambiguity._ \n\nTransfer @$200,000 from Juicebox v1 treasury to Juicebox v2 treasury.\n\n## Rationale\n\n_Why is this specification appropriate?_\n\nIf we do not do the specification, we will not be able to payout the v2 projects obligations and would be forced to “default” on the projects obligations or move payouts from v2 to v1. \n\nThe $200,000 value is arbitrary and I invited debate/feedback on this value in the discussion.\n\nAdditionally, snapshot ends on the Friday before the configuration is executed. It might make sense for the DAO to allocate this transfer from the multisig balance. Although this would cause issue’s to previous allocations. ——- I will strike this argument following discussion.\n\n## Risks\n\n_What might go wrong?_\n\nThe price of eth could drop substantially in the future and the $200,000 may not be enough. Additionally, the transfer specified in this proposals likely needs to come before the v2 payout occurs in FC#32 otherwise, there may not be enough funds in the treasury to payout the obligations. \n\nIf this proposal is not met, an emergency proposal may be required to ensure obligatory funding.\n\n## Timeline\n\n_When exactly should this proposal take effect? When exactly should this proposal end?_ \n\nThis transfer will occur in FC#32\n\n\n---\n[Discussion Thread](https://discord.com/channels/775859454780244028/873248745771372584/1022756023590723624) | [IPFS](https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmTypNqzjXUwfBiBy4avesLeHX26Poagy73bu6vXZyrqrC)",

This is also a branding opportunity for JB. \n\nNicholas is working on an onchain svg rendered tokenUriResolver (WIP [Github](https://github.com/nnnnicholas/juice-tokenUriResolver)) It will look more-or-less like the screenshot below by default for each project. Project owners will be able to entirely override this visualization (and accompanying text metadata) with their own uri resolver logic if they want to. The aesthetics and functionality are under active development and I expect the tokenUriResolver to be updated several times over the next few months.\n\nFun aside: this uses @peri’s Capsules font, which he created and deployed onchain at [https://cpsls.app](https://cpsls.app) \n\n![](https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/836e4381-6d97-4ae1-88e9-f883be1d1836/F6C4D347-3D56-4431-863F-98761B5014CE.jpeg?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Content-Sha256=UNSIGNED-PAYLOAD&X-Amz-Credential=AKIAT73L2G45EIPT3X45%2F20220927%2Fus-west-2%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20220927T000030Z&X-Amz-Expires=3600&X-Amz-Signature=db4b0ed494c5c70193c324903208f4c5bceaa3a463220fcd500d98cb9bfec521&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&x-id=GetObject)\n\n## Specification\n\nGrant the multisig permission to set and change the tokenUriResolver. Nicholas and Jango (and other members of the contract crew) will communicate with the multisig to update the tokenUriResolver over time as they deem necessary. \n\nThis permission is revoked in 3 months and this permission can be reproposed if necessary. \n\n## Rationale\n\nThe tokenUriResolver is a low stakes parameter of the protocol. Granting open ended permission to the multisig to update it poses no major threat to the security or usability of the protocol, and gives JBDAO’s devs the opportunity to improve the tokenUriResolver contract iteratively. \n\n## Risks\n\nThe tokenUriResolver could be used to deploy bad metadata that is deceptive or underwhelming. In the extreme worst case, the tokenUriResolver could enable malicious wallet interaction in unsafe NFT metadata browsers — though OpenSea and other major marketplaces have protections in place to remove this threat vector.\n\n## Timeline\n\nGrant open ended permission to the multisig to update the tokenUriResolver for a period of 3 months.\n\n\n---\n[Discussion Thread](https://discord.com/channels/775859454780244028/873248745771372584/1022986781542596701) | [IPFS](https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/Qmdpz5m7Ei1V38Sd3yrJ8jV4s2Afssf675MZLR22voTZJu)",

      "content": "\n```plain text\nAuthor: gulan\nDate: 2022-05-\n```\n\n## Thesis\n\n_What’s the idea?_\n\n- To provide a clear default limit for ongoing recurring proposals that do not specify a cycle expiration\n\n- To limit reserve rate allotments to 2 decimal places in accordance with the current UX configuration restrictions\n\n## Motivation\n\n_Why now? What problems does this solve?_\n\n- JBP-197 clearly limited the active recurring payout proposals to seven cycles, but did not address future proposals. The Juicebox community/governance implementer’s have relied on authors to specify the final cycle where the payouts will sunset, however sometimes this specification is still missed. In the cases where the proposal does not specify a sunset cycle, the bookkeeper, @gulan,  has limited the payouts to 7 cycle in alignment to the ‘90 day’ informal expiration policy. This proposal seeks to codify the 7 cycle limit when authors do not specify a sunset clause.\n\n\n- The Juicebox ’Reserved JBX’ list regularly changes and proposals have done a great job at specifying allotments. However, as it stands the Juicebox UX does not allow for more that 2 decimal places. In cases where this limitation has not match the proposal specification, the configurer @twodam has informally rounded the allotments. This proposal seeks to codify the rounding to two decimals where authors include 3 decimal places.\n\n## Specification\n\n_How exactly will this be executed? Be specific and leave no ambiguity._\n\n- When proposal authors do not specify a sunset clause in a recurring payout proposal, the bookkeeper shall limit the number of payout cycle’s to a maximum of 7. \n\n\t- This proposal shall not be used to limit the creativity of authors in anyway (e.g. authors can create payouts for shorter or longer than 7 cycle).\n\n\t- This proposal shall only be used in case where the author does not mention a sunset clause.\n\n- When proposal authors specify a change to the ‘Reserved JBX’ list that includes three decimal places (e.g. 0.123’, the bookkeeper shall round down the third decimal to 0 and reallocate any remaining percentage to the juice-box multisig (dao.juicebox.eth).\n\n- This proposal should be reconsidered if necessary when:\n\n\t- Bookkeeping Automatons (currently being worked on by @jigglyjams) flow has eliminated its need\n\n\t- The UX & Contract team has allowed for more decimal places to be configured for the reserve list\n\n## Rationale\n\n_Why is this specification the best way to address this thesis?_\n\nThe best method’s to avoid the above situations is to provide authors with feedback during the drafting stages. However, even with feedback, authors may not modify proposals to reflect required changes by the time proposal moves to snapshot and is locked. The above specification is a catch all for these situations. \n\nThe current grey area is awkward for the bookkeeper as no specific proposal requires the limitation but instead the bookkeeper relies on informing questioners of historical precedent. \n\n## Risks\n\nThe bookkeeper could use the authority of this proposal to falsely modify proposals to punish their enemies or reward their friends. \n\n## Timeline\n\n_When exactly should this proposal take effect? When exactly should this proposal end?_\n\n- This proposal shall take effect immediately upon passing snapshot\n\n- A new proposal to rescind all or parts of this proposal should be considered when clause 3(a) or 3(b) is met. However, a proposal to rescind all or parts can be considered at any time.\n\n\n---\n[Discussion Thread](https://discord.com/channels/775859454780244028/873248745771372584/1017938560856358952) | [IPFS](https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmNqZ6P67XZCMcjdcw8PPjMfLW2TCD2h4wJSMHTF15EcYB)",

      "content": "\n```plain text\nAuthor: jango.eth\nDate: (2022-9-8)\n```\n\n## Synopsis\n\nAs JuiceboxDAO looks to encourage and support game-changing projects and capital formation schemas to form leveraging the Juicebox protocol, it should consider sponsoring accessible in-real-life gatherings hosted by contributors intimately familiar with the protocol and its potential applications to big-picture ideas, and attended by passionate builders, designers, and capital allocators.\n\nThe Thirsty Thirsty community and I are curating programming in a house in Bogota for ceremony, celebration of our agricultural lineage, and design sprints focused around how we might sustainably fund land-based projects using Web3 primitives, around the time of DevCon.\n\nOctober 10 is Indigenous Peoples Day. Participate in a Rapé ceremony with a small group of 10ish invitees hosted by our Indigenous partner and friend Juanda, followed by an open farm-to-table breakfast. \n\nOptionally, invitees can secure a bedroom in our house for the week as their home-base for DevCon. We will host this ceremony for the small group, and then open up design sprints, gatherings, and stock the kitchen with local food and drinks for broader groups of our Web3 builder friends. The space will regularly remain open for programming from others who are building projects leveraging the Juicebox protocol.\n\nWe're booking for a week, and asking for a $35,000 grant to cover expenses for invitees.\n\n## Motivation\n\nA few weeks ago at the FWB festival in Idyllwild I met Bruxa, an incredibly passionate hospitality professional who is evolving her organization, Thirsty Thirsty (thirstythirsty.org), to being community-owned using Web3 tools. We quickly bonded over big ideas of funding mechanisms to sustain land-based projects that bring people together over delicious ingredients and big-picture impact, and our complicated Brazilian heritage. \n\n> \"Thirsty Thirsty is an ancestral remembrance project disguised as the coolest food and wine club on Earth. Through celebrating ancestral agricultural lineages, we regenerate the planet and our interconnectedness – deliciously.\"\n\nBruxa has relationships with hospitality pros and farmers around the world. One of which, Juanda, is an Indigenous jungle guide passionate about Amazonas food-ways and wisdom in the Colombian zone. Per his recommendation, Juanda will host a Rapé ceremony for a small group of invited people on the morning of October 10th in Bogota, followed by a farm-to-table breakfast prepared by a local top chef in Bruxa's network. \n\n> 🐍 Rapé is a traditional “snuff” in Amazonas. The ceremony provides clarity, concentration, and third-eye activation before a hunt.\n\nWe're planning to book a beautiful house for the ceremony, which will also have 5 rooms for folks to call home-base for the week. We'll hold formal and informal design sprints with whoever is around. The focus is to design and build funding mechanisms to sustain land-based movements. \n\nWe're **raising a minimum of $35,000** to carry out the event to its fullest capacity, and are encouraging **another $10,000 earmarked to be spent to kickstart funding** for what we build together on-site. Assuming a 10 person ceremony, this comes to an upfront $3,500 per person. This funding proposals to JBDAO, alongside other individual contributions the jb project might receive, will cover invitee's costs on their behalf: [https://juicebox.money/v2/p/228](https://juicebox.money/v2/p/228).\n\n**$2,500** to Juanda for producing & hosting. Goes to support his build of Amazonas location.\n**$10,000** for rent and the production of all culinary events and special programming.\n**$12,500** to pay the production staff at Bruxa’s discretion.\n**$10,000** to pay for Thirsty Thirsty XP memberships that’ll be leveraged as prizes throughout the week. Any leftovers will be designated to JBDAO for discretionary use.\n\nInvites will be prioritized to JuiceboxDAO contributors interested in helping build fundraising experiments during the week. No more than half invitees will be JuiceboxDAO focused to make sure there’s space for valuable people from around the ecosystem to take part alongside. Reach out to Jango if interested.\n\n\n_Although JuiceboxDAO shouldn’t expect it, any funds that prove to be in excess of our needs will be returned to the DAO._\n\n🐍 Check out [Juanda’s instagram](https://www.instagram.com/juandamazonas/) for jungle inspiration.\n🥂 Check out TT’s past event photos [here](https://www.thirstythirsty.org/events) for vibes. \n\n## Specification\n\nJuiceboxDAO will route **$35,000 worth of ETH** from its V2 treasury to [Project ID 228](https://juicebox.money/v2/p/228).\n\n## Rationale\n\nProject ID 228 will be used entirely to pay for all ingredients that will make the event a success. Invitees are asked to donate $3,500 worth of ETH each to the treasury if they decide to participate — this grant from JuiceboxDAO will reduce this burden for participants.\n\n## Risks\n\nRunning events involve lots of moving parts and exposure to environmental uncertainties, there are many unforeseen things that could go wrong in the process. Our partnership with Thirsty Thirsty is meant to mitigate these risks and ensure we’re paying established hospitality professionals and event producers to do the best they can with new information that may arise along the way.\n\n## Timeline\n\nThis one time payment should be encoded as soon as possible.\n\n\n---\n[Discussion Thread](https://discord.com/channels/775859454780244028/873248745771372584/1017806413105467523) | [IPFS](https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmZSVZFrR8V7fE5LPetw79d81bmiVnxMY8hYx8hMARhTKV)",

      "content": "\n```plain text\nAuthor: jango.eth\nDate: (2022-09-09)\n```\n\n## Synopsis\n\nJuiceboxDAO should support the development of experimental projects built using Juicebox protocol primitives, especially those that will offer generalized components that reduce the work and uncertainty of subsequent projects that wish to operate similar experiments.\n\nThe Defifa experimental project is built using the forthcoming NFTRewards infrastructure that’ll be deployed alongside the V3 protocol. It creates a team-based NFT tournament to accompany the 2022 World Cup, where each token’s redemption value is readjusted depending on the team’s performance.\n\nThe game is spec’d [here](/8644f449958e4d9bb632cb5a46708fb6) and conversation has been unfolding [here](https://discord.com/channels/775859454780244028/1012501341626699896). I’m very confident it can be built in time for the tournament given a month of attention from a dedicated front-end developer, contract developer, and designer supported by the usual cast of JuiceboxDAO contributors.\n\nJango will be the project manager and lead contract architect, and will try to allocate resources appropriately towards the success of the project.\n\n## Motivation\n\nThe protocol’s infrastructure, the World Cup’s timing, and the current JuiceboxDAO personnel are ripe for the construction of Defifa. The NFTRewards extension is ready to be published, the World Cup is right around the corner in late November, and there’s a clear urge for experimenting with templated single-purpose treasuries that are owned by a set of fixed contractual rules instead of a governing entity.\n\nThis experiment will be generalizable such that it can be reused for subsequent tournament-style competitions. The website and contracts constructed for Defifa will focus on this one-time event, and will be built with generalization in mind to accommodate future iterations.\n\n## Specification\n\n\nJuiceboxDAO will payout $30,770 (comes to ~$30k after JBX fees) worth of ETH from its v1 treasury into the multisig as soon as possible.\n\nAs soon as the V3 treasury is deployed, JuiceboxDAO will send over the ETH balance from the payout to the to-be-deployed “Build Defifa” V3 treasury, owned by a 1/N multisig initially managed by Jango and JuiceboxDAO. \n\nThe Defifa game will likely include a mechanism to payout a portion of its raised funds to the “Build Defifa” treasury, which JuiceboxDAO can reclaim funds from given its project token position from this grant. Do not count on this.\n\nThese funds are not meant to double-compensate workers already being supported by JuiceboxDAO — those being compensated for working on Defifa should not also include this work in future payout proposals to JuiceboxDAO.\n\nAny leftover funds in the treasury after the game’s construction will be used to support future Defifa instances.\n\n## Rationale\n\nPayouts to contributors are best managed from a Juicebox treasury.\n\n## Risks\n\nThe event’s timing is concrete, we have a tight deadline. If for any reason the project is not completed in time, we will complete the infra and use it for a future tournament style event.\n\n## Timeline\n\nAs soon as possible.\n\n\n---\n[Discussion Thread](https://discord.com/channels/775859454780244028/873248745771372584/1017839136352256102) | [IPFS](https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/Qmf4T8MxfrKpAwkSBTgKCLnbjWjdPEH3uwrt7xYyoxiuX3)",

This is a mitigation review, in which C4A wardens will review the Juicebox V3 code, which patches the vulnerabilities discovered in [JBP-206 Sponsor Code4rena Audit](https://juicetool.xyz/snapshot/jbdao.eth/proposal/0x3bc54466f651d559b9e4ff45d1576085ec057fcb5bf6b85afacc5806b9c5a6f4). \n\nIt is important that JBDAO fund a security audit of the V3 changes before they are deployed to mainnet.

      "content": "\n```plain text\nAuthor: filipv\nDate: 2022-08-26\n```\n\n## Thesis\n\nRemove translation payouts.\n\n## Motivation\n\n- Nothing has been translated for over a month.\n\n- Nothing translated on DeWork has ever been publicly distributed (except for documents distributed by Zhape and Twodam).\n\n- Countries reflected in [juicebox.money analytics](https://app.usefathom.com/share/eryrrjsv/juicebox.money) do not necessarily reflect the Juicebox community. Hong Kong, India, Japan, Taiwan, and Singapore contain major VPN servers used by popular providers.\n\n- Zhape, Twodam, and other contributors are independently translating [juicebox.money](https://juicebox.money/) and other important documents into Chinese. This system is preferred, as those contributors produce high-quality translations and can exercise reasonable discretion.\n\n## Specification\n\nRevoke _JBP-183 - Zótico’s reccuring payout update_. Remove all payouts to `0x6212ce06Dcac01706e6Be5310C3228ede1A02ADf`.\n\nRemove any outstanding translation budgets.\n\n## Risks\n\n- This proposal will probably be controversial.\n\n- [juicebox.money](https://juicebox.money/) will not be as inclusive.\n\n- Having translations on hand would be very useful in the case of a major publicity event within a country which speaks one of the languages mentioned above.\n\n\n---\n[Discussion Thread](https://discord.com/channels/775859454780244028/873248745771372584/1012881260655423539) | [IPFS](https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmcupVM35QMsLPc37jzQPkmNijcV2qA4nbLEjk1LiSWodS)",

My initial recurring payment has come to an end, this proposal will allow me to keep working full-time on Juicebox.\n\n## Motivation\n\nI have worked on a large variety of things since my last proposal, here is a small list of the most important things:\n\n- Work on NFT-Rewards ([commits](https://github.com/jbx-protocol/juice-nft-rewards/commits?author=xBA5ED))\n\n- Work on VeBanny ([commits](https://github.com/jbx-protocol/juice-ve-nft/commits?author=xBA5ED))\n\n- Work on AppleJuice ([commits](https://github.com/drgorillamd/applejuice-terminal/commits/feat/AJPayoutRedemptionTerminal?author=xBA5ED))\n\n- Work on on-chain governance ([repo](https://github.com/xBA5ED/juice-kickstart-governance))\n\n- Started writing formal verification for V2 ([commit](https://github.com/jbx-protocol/juice-contracts-v2/commit/886eb82ce60095adfa65d68a00684cb3cb1d6a02))\n\nDuring EthCC I took a course by [Certora](https://www.certora.com/) on how to do formal verification. The normal cost for having contracts formally verified is $70,000 per week ([source](https://governance.aave.com/t/continuous-formal-verification/6308#pricing-12)). However I am now able to work on this for Juicebox, potentially saving a large amount of money.\n\nIn the future FC's I would like to work on:\n\n- Finishing the WIP extensions\n\n- [Standardising extensions](https://discord.com/channels/775859454780244028/1009283720273989762/1009283721775546470)\n\n- More extensions (gasless payments, llamapay integration)\n\n- L2/Side-chain versions(/extensions) of Juicebox\n\n- Formal verification of more Juicebox contracts\n\n## Specification\n\nFor the next 6 funding cycles continue to pay (0xBA5ED) `0xb045708e396E20071324C1aed2E4CFB90A0764FE` $8000 per funding cycle and keep him on the list of beneficiaries of reserved JBX.\n\n## Rationale\n\nSmart-contract developers are hard to hire because its new, niche and there is a high demand. 0xBA5ED is an experienced smart-contract developer and is comfortable with and has a good understanding of the Juicebox V2 codebase.\n\n## Risks\n\n- Reduced quality or less code shipped than before\n\n- 0xBA5ED could stop contributing\n\n## Timeline\n\nRenew recurring payouts starting at funding cycle 30 for 6 funding cycles.\n\n\n---\n[Discussion Thread](https://discord.com/channels/775859454780244028/873248745771372584/1012784141042974720) | [IPFS](https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmbqFxAxBXGLckCzmVBoyU48ktLpktRBfQgTcGjHqm9h98)",

Considering the contest is aiming to engage and support communities in the JB ecosystem and potentially bring in more, We would like to ask for 1 extra ETH to the winning project from the JB treasury._\n\n## Motivation\n\n_100TM is a project focused on creating sustainable cities, and one thing a sustainable city needs is creativity! You can learn more about us and our mission in our_[ _notion_](/8ed34651d345446b9d239dd4027b8841) _and_ [_discord_](https://discord.gg/fU2CcrhQ)_. In the web3 space there's no crowd more creative than JB, so we feel like supporting projects in the JB ecosystem to leverage both our and their growth is going to be to the benefit of everyone involved._\n\n**context:**\n\n100TM is an initiative toward leveling up the standard of living for everyone. We're designing Earth Cities that are nature-focused with sustainability at its core. The cities of the future are nothing without creative people and solutions. So we want to supercharge them.\n\nWe believe that communities should have self-governance mechanics, so we're choosing the winner by giving voting tokens to anyone who verifies and sends their wallet address in our Discord.\n\nThe community projects will be submitted to [@jokedao_](https://twitter.com/jokedao_) \nThe deadline for submissions is Sep 8th.\n\nAfter submissions are closed, you'll be able to vote on the projects you want us to invest. Just join our Discord to get the voting tokens.\n\nAs voting is an essential part of governance, all voters for the winning project will get to participate in a raffle for 0.1 ETH, so make sure to vote! Voting starts Sep 8th, winner gets announced on sep 10th!\n\nThe winner also gets a spotlight on the [@100tmln](https://twitter.com/100tmln) server, for an AMA session on Sept 10th to tell us what their project is all about. That's when we'll hold the raffle for the voters so be there!\n\n## Specification\n\nMultisig should deposit 1 ETH on the winning project’s treasury.\n\n## Rationale\n\n_That’s how we execute the proposal._\n\n## Risks\n\n_Contest might be a flop._\n\n## Timeline\n\n_Proposal should be a one time only payment on September 10th_\n\n\n---\n[Discussion Thread](https://discord.com/channels/775859454780244028/873248745771372584/1012784140342526063) | [IPFS](https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmfXhaCDEL7Xtw8kBqfAwo5vtqhLiMR2eXoHEShSubpjDS)",

      "content": "\n```plain text\nAuthor: jigglyjams\nDate: 2022-08-26\n```\n\n## Thesis\n\nAdd gnance.eth (0x50e70c43a5DD812e2309eAcea61348041011b4BA) as a delegate to the Juicebox gnosis-safe (0xAF28bcB48C40dBC86f52D459A6562F658fc94B1e). This will allow nance to automatically queue transaction to the multi-sig. No abilities to execute the transactions will be held by gnance.eth.\n\n## Motivation\n\nWe want to make things easier for the multi-sig signers. Every funding cycle twodam must manually enter any new payouts and reserve rate distributions into the project reconfiguration. This can be a tedious task and automating it will free up additional time of important contributors.\n\n## Specification\n\nThere is not an official app to add delegates to a safe (gnosis only provides an API endpoint for it). There is however an open source project that implements one, [https://gnosis-delegator-soptq.vercel.app/](https://gnosis-delegator-soptq.vercel.app/), with source code, [https://github.com/Soptq/gnosis-safe-delegate-dapp](https://github.com/Soptq/gnosis-safe-delegate-dapp).\n\n**Major Note: the app only supports MetaMask at the moment**\n\nIf approved, one of the multi-sig signers will need to follow the following steps:\n\n- Go to [https://gnosis-delegator-soptq.vercel.app/](https://gnosis-delegator-soptq.vercel.app/)\n\n- Connect MetaMask wallet\n\n- Load Gnosis Safes\n\n- Add 0x50e70c43a5DD812e2309eAcea61348041011b4BA, label ‘nance’\n\n- Sign transaction\n\n- Done!\n\n(jigglyjams can create a video of the above if any of it is unclear)\n\n## Rationale\n\nSee motivation.\n\nMore information on multi-sig delegates here: [https://safe-docs.dev.gnosisdev.com/safe/docs/tutorial_tx_service_set_delegate/](https://safe-docs.dev.gnosisdev.com/safe/docs/tutorial_tx_service_set_delegate/)\n\n## Risks\n\nSigners may not have MetaMask making this proposal a little harder to implement. If that is the case, jigglyjams will submit a PR to the project to add more wallet support.\n\n## Timeline\n\nTo be implement before FC#31 begins so that nance can automatically submit transactions for FC#31\n\n\n---\n[Discussion Thread](https://discord.com/channels/775859454780244028/873248745771372584/1012868423329513514) | [IPFS](https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmZBtqnVx8aK59gQHfEwuVWNCfPFKrmSszwyKBN3tAmfyX)",

Because of this, less JBX is going to project creators, contributors, and the DAO.\n\n## Specification\n\n- Configure [JuiceboxDAO v1](https://juicebox.money/p/juicebox)’s discount rate to `5` (a discount rate of 0.5%).\n\n- Configure v2 [JuiceboxDAO](https://juicebox.money/@juicebox)’s discount rate to `5000000` (a discount rate of 0.5%).\n\n## Risks\n\nThe discount rate rewards earlier JBX recipients. Reducing the discount rate reduces this reward.\n\n## Timeline\n\nThe discount rate should remain at 0.5% until this proposal is revoked or superceded by another proposal.\n\n\n---\n[Discussion Thread](https://discord.com/channels/775859454780244028/873248745771372584/1012881009181741146) | [IPFS](https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmZdVbqDebCLQHbf6syT8h9SCEVxFGPtcDfkTEmSAsLQ2s)",

Not only will this proliferate the Juicebox protocol and decentralize its frontend—it will allow me to more earnestly approach focus areas which I believe are important for the future of the Juicebox protocol (which would not be as useful when applied to current offerings).\n\n- Some of the work I have done for Juicebox in the past (including some work related to governance, tooling, and bookkeeping) is either completed, no longer necessary, or managed by other DAO members (this is a great thing).\n\nTO BE CLEAR: I will still be contributing to Juicebox DAO. Juicebox is not paying me to work on Movement. This payout is for the continued work I will be doing for Juicebox DAO.\n\n## Specification\n\n- Remove the [JuiceboxDAO v1](https://etherscan.io/enslookup-search?search=filipv.eth) payout to filipv.eth ([`0x30670d81e487c80b9edc54370e6eaf943b6eab39`](https://etherscan.io/enslookup-search?search=filipv.eth)).\n\n- Add a 6000 USD/FC payout to filipv.eth ([`0x30670d81e487c80b9edc54370e6eaf943b6eab39`](https://etherscan.io/enslookup-search?search=filipv.eth)) to [JuiceboxDAO](https://juicebox.money/@juicebox)’s v2 treasury.\n\n## Risks\n\n- This may not be the best utilization of time.\n\n- This endeavor favors the long-term over the short term.\n\n- I may fail to perform.\n\n## Timeline\n\nThis payout should be removed in FC#36. \n\n_Note: This proposal supersedes JBP-205._\n\n\n---\n[Discussion Thread](https://discord.com/channels/775859454780244028/873248745771372584/1007799793659170896) | [IPFS](https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/Qmb3onNPwmz58ECytYUzhDJqNkthtDUHVDVrwo1GZBg888)",

Our management would include curating voxel experiences and continued modular design of the parcel as well as continue running FORMING as a monthly musicial event in Voxels and other Metaverse platforms.\n\n## Motivation\n\nThe Lexicon Devils team consists of metaverse architects, graphic designers, 3D artists, and musicians capable of utilizing multi-mediums and platforms to promote Juicebox\nProtocol with continued events, parties, and interactive experiences that can demonstrate specific capabilities of the protocol and introduce more Web3 enthusiasts. We also want to create enjoyable events for the Juicebox community to hang out at and provide NFT merch to wear and share.\n\n## Abstract:\n\nLexicon Devils has built, designed and curated the Metaverse headquarters for\nJuicebox Protocol. We have continued to update, alter and manage the space along\nwith hosting regular events featuring art shows and live streamed musical\nperformances. We want to use the space to continuously promote ongoing Juicebox news, media and events and use FORMING to allow us to run events there and other Metaverse platforms that relate back to the Juicebox protocol.\n\n## Rationale\n\n**What have we done?**\n\n3 Events each month with opening/closing nights featuring DJ’s and Twitter Spaces interviews and a main event musician booked each month. We continuously improved the Juicebox HQ parcel and installed a replica of the Morgenstern’s location coinciding with the Juicebox NFTNYC event. We created our FORMING series, paying out 5 artists using Juicebox with original animations, music and production.\n\n**What are we going to do?**\n\nLexicon Devils is a team of 7 creatives and promoters operating at a collective total of 110 hrs a week. This $6600 will be for compensating time, energy and labor. We will be putting 3 ETH into the FORMING Juicebox (Varied amounts each time to encourage participation) over the funding cycle and experimenting with NFT Rewards for additional crowd funding of each FORMING pay cycle. We have recently acquired parcels across various other Metaverse platforms, we want to expand FORMING events to run across those and increase the overall exposure to Juicebox as a tool that can be useful to groups in any Metaverse. We will continue updating the Voxels parcel. \n\n## Risks\n\nLack of attendance to some events / indirect, ambient value that doesn't materialize in\ndirect engagement with the Juicebox protocol. We fail to do our jobs, maintaining a continuous timeline of events.\n\n## Specification\n\nContinued bi weekly payments of ETH valued at US $6600 into the Lexicon Devil’s Juicebox. \n\n## Timeline\n\nAs soon snapshot vote passes. \n\n\n---\n[Discussion Thread](https://discord.com/channels/775859454780244028/873248745771372584/1007783934983147611) | [IPFS](https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmfHxPUtoHA2LVoLDXRH8i1KCNQbxLhdApMqfR5eCCX3S1)",

What problems does this solve?_\n\nJuicebox V2 is live on mainnet, it provides more functionality and possibility. There is need for <u>updating dune dashboards</u> to sync up with new features, for example: NFT Rewards, Treasury Extensions.\n\nWith the current process of preparing reconfiguration, it take hours/FC for me to review and submit the reconfiguration. There is need to <u>write tools and improve process</u>, so we can have more automatic system, reduce dependency on certain people (jango or me for now) to do this job. If we go further, we could automate bookkeeping too, make this a tool and provide to projects on juicebox protocol.\n\nJuicebox have no official announcement channel for new features, although we do have regularly town-hall meetings and individuals who will tweet about features, there are still some people wondering the status of specific feature or questions like “what’s happening”.

      "content": "\n```plain text\nAuthor: Zotico\nDate: 2022-08-12\n```\n\n## Thesis\n\nWith the new guidelines ([link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1y0SyTL89M3Hek_RRugng6T0jpJd1uoBR1q3rLZchmkM/edit?usp=sharing)) for translation, the amounts paid to translators in each cycle should not exceed $1,000. The proposal is for this amount to be deposited each cycle in the multisig translation wallet so that payments can be made.\n\n## Motivation\n\nWith the approval of the budget proposal, we will make translation spending more predictable, which will help manage DAO's resources.\n\nBearing in mind the recent discussions on translation, we created a new guidelines document together with the translator community and other process change proponents, in order to arrive at a more efficient process. These changes are in the document ([link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1y0SyTL89M3Hek_RRugng6T0jpJd1uoBR1q3rLZchmkM/edit?usp=sharing)).\n\nWith these changes, spending on translations becomes more predictable, which allows us to improve the process and reduce the burden of financial management. The total cost for the work performed by the translators should not exceed $1000 per cycle. If translators produce more than $1000 in one cycle, the remaining amount will be paid in later cycles, respecting the rules described in the guidelines. This proposal is for the value to be added as a recurring payment of $1000 per cycle to the multisig. This money will be used for translation expenses, and can be audited more easily than in the previous process, observing the movement in the multisig (0x835F397D5cD21eBAe820FDC3fc6eAC98520534ee).\n\n## Specification\n\nA payout of $1000 to the multisig: 0x835F397D5cD21eBAe820FDC3fc6eAC98520534ee per 14 cycle.\n\n## Rationale\n\nThis way of managing makes the costs more predictable, while maintaining incentives to production. I believe it this is the simplest way to keep costs at a predictable since it will just be another payment included in future cycles.\n\n## Risks\n\nThis budget limitation can cause a the payment to a translator who translates a lot in one cycle to take a few cycles to be paid in full and this will incur a long-term “debt” to the DAO.\n\n## Timeline\n\nThis proposal shall take effect as from its approval and end within the defined period.\n\n\n---\n[Discussion Thread](https://discord.com/channels/775859454780244028/873248745771372584/1007783431763140698) | [IPFS](https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmP2xyRyg8YGZqEYknyXFU2cVx7aWhoSRFaRHf9XWorYmy)",

      "content": "\n```plain text\nAuthor: zhape.eth\nDate: 2022-08-10\n```\n\n## Thesis\n\nTo renew the recurring payout and reserved token beneficiary for zhape.eth.\n\n## Motivation\n\nI have made some contributions to the DAO since my recurring payout was approved, and I hope I can go on contributing to Juicebox DAO and be a part of the contributor family. \n\n## Specification\n\nPay zhape.eth US$1500 in equivalent of ETH each Funding Cycle, for 6 FCs.\n\n## Rationale\n\n### What I’ve done during this payout period：\n\n- As I personally feel that the weekly Town Hall meeting is one of best windows to get the most up-to-date information about the current situation of our DAO and the Juicebox protocol,  I have been compiling a summary / transcript of the Town Hall, and trying to make the content more reader friendly by adding some relevant images, links or other contexts. What I have done about this can be found here:  [https://hackmd.io/@zhape/jbx_town_hall_archive](https://hackmd.io/@zhape/jbx_town_hall_archive)\n\n- And considering that we have a quite large base of Chinese speaking members, I have also been making a Chinese version of Town Hall recap, sharing it in the CN channel, so that anyone who is interested can also have some ideas about what our community has been up to lately.  The history of all the recaps can be found here: [https://discord.com/channels/775859454780244028/935431085561630721/978201195774619668](https://discord.com/channels/775859454780244028/935431085561630721/978201195774619668)\n\n- Some of the Chinese translations to blog posts have been finished for a long time, but they have been lying in the database without being uploaded to our website for actual use. I proofread some of them, complied them into Markdown format, before committed and pushed them onto our GitHub repository so that they are now synced on our website. The ones I have proofread and uploaded can be found here: [https://www.notion.so/juicebox/6396660ce0b541069716b9f0782968bc?v=766b0977b1e94fddb8d71bcdd8298277](https://www.notion.so/juicebox/6396660ce0b541069716b9f0782968bc?v=766b0977b1e94fddb8d71bcdd8298277)\n\n- Acted as a moderator in the CN channels, but due to the current market conditions, there have not been too many activities in the Chinese community, so there have not been too much work in this respect. \n\n### What I am going to do：\n\n- Keep doing the compiling of Town Hall recap, if this job’s recognized as useful by the DAO.\n\n- Compiling a Chinese version of Town Hall recap, which is not a simple translation to the English one, but instead a kind of story telling in my own words, so hopefully will be more acceptable to our Chinese speaking members. Actually I have been experimenting this model for a few Funding Cycles.\n\n- Keep working towards making the Chinese content as high quality as I can:\n\n\t- Help making sure any new Chinese translator are capable of proper translation before they can claim a job, because except for language skills, they need to at least roughly understand the mechanism of Juicebox so as to understand properly the docs or blog posts.\n\n\t- Do one more step of proofreading to the finished jobs as I have been doing above, as some of the jobs are done poorly even with a revision mechanism at this moment. As it seems we don’t have extra budget for this proofreading, I am willing to give up any extra pay for this.\n\n\t- Help uploading the finished translations onto [info.juicebox.money](http://info.juicebox.money).\n\n\t- Try to help improve the work flow of Chinese translation.\n\n- Keep working as a moderator of CN channel, to answer questions of CN members or help them get questions answered, help proposal drafting and/or project onboarding if there is any.

      "title": "JBP-240 - Peel recurring payout renewal",
      "content": "\n \n```plain text\nAuthor: aeolian\nDate: (2022-07-26)\n```\n\n## Thesis\n\nRenew Peel’s recurring payout at US$60,000 per funding cycle (FC). Peel is the team that builds and maintains juicebox.money.\n\n## Motivation\n\nThe Juicebox protocol needs a gold-standard frontend.\n\nOther Juicebox frontends will come and go. But for the Juicebox protocol to continue to grow, there must be one frontend that stands the test of time.\n\nSuch a frontend must be built with security, longevity, and usability in mind. It must be built with (very) tight collaboration with the Juicebox contract crew. And it must balance new features with the need to support all past Juicebox projects.\n\n[juicebox.money](http://juicebox.money) is Juicebox’s gold-standard frontend.\n\nAnd Peel is the team behind it.\n\nPeel is delivering. We are a team of six engineers and two UX designers on the grind to keep the juice flowing.\n\nSome highlights since our last payout renewal:\n\n- Shipped a frontend for Juicebox V2, backwards-compatible with Juicebox V1.\n\n- Overhauled our infrastructure to address critical security, reliability, performance and SEO issues. Our underlying tech stack is now NextJS, running on Vercel.\n\n- Launched NFT Rewards and JBX staking (veBanny) on Rinkeby test net.\n\n- Built a V2 upgrade path for V1 project token holders (behind a feature flag, pending general availability).\n\n- Added a variety of user-requested features including Payable Address deployments, payment memo stickers, and a juicier home page (featured on [Bankless](https://newsletter.banklesshq.com/p/crypto-treasury-management-juicebox)).\n\nBut we are not done. Here’s what’s on our horizon:\n\n- **Multi-token funding.** Fund your Juicebox treasury with USDC, DAI, ETH, and more ([GitHub](https://github.com/jbx-protocol/juice-interface/issues/1438)).\n\n- **Usability overhaul.** We want to create the best possible experience for Juicebox project owners. This means a seamless project creation experience, intuitive project management tools and settings, and improving owner confidence when submitting transactions ([1](https://github.com/jbx-protocol/juice-interface/issues/1390), [2](https://github.com/jbx-protocol/juice-interface/issues/1327)).\n\n- **Better distribution.** We're solving long-awaited social media and SEO issues related to juicebox.money. Better link unfurling and juicier Google results coming soon ([GitHub](https://github.com/jbx-protocol/juice-interface/pull/1555)).\n\n- **Robust versioning UX.** The Juicebox protocol contracts are always evolving with bug fixes and security patches. We must devise a contract versioning support strategy for the frontend ([GitHub](https://github.com/jbx-protocol/juice-interface/issues/1440)).\n\nPeel commits to owning and maintaining the following projects:\n\n- [juicebox.money](http://juicebox.money) and [rinkeby.juicebox.money](http://rinkeby.juicebox.money) (or a future preferred testnet).\n\n- [The Juicebox Subgraph](https://github.com/jbx-protocol/juice-subgraph), on TheGraph.\n\n- [juice-hooks](https://github.com/jbx-protocol/juice-hooks) - a React Hooks library for the Juicebox V2 protocol.\n\n- [juice-sdk](https://github.com/jbx-protocol/juice-sdk) - a Javascript SDK for the Juicebox V2 protocol.\n\n## Specification\n\nContinue payouts of  US$60,000 per FC to Peel (V1 project handle `@peel`).\n\n## Rationale\n\nA US$60,000 payout represents an additional $14,000 per funding cycle.\n\n> FTE = Full-time equivalent; IC = individual contributor; DRI = directly responsible individual\n\nOur current capacity is as follows (see [Juicebox funding distribution](https://www.juicebox.money/p/peel)):\n\n- 1 lead/DRI @ $14,000 per FC\n\n- 3.4 FTE ICs @ $9000 per FC\n\nWe are requesting more budget to scale to the following:\n\n- 1 lead/DRI @ $14,000 per FC\n\n- 5 FTE ICs @ $9000 per FC\n\nThis enables us to:\n\n- Scale up our UX efforts to 1 FTE (currently, we have no one focused on UX).\n\n- Scale up our engineering team from 3.4 FTE to 4 (to account for existing contributors increasing their responsibilities)\n\nOur development team has scaled sufficiently. We won’t be expanding our recurring contributor base in the foreseeable future.\n\nBeyond this, Peel must budget for infrastructure including Infura, Blocknative, Vercel, TheGraph, Pinata, and Fathom Analytics.\n\n---\n\nRelevant links:\n\n- Peel proposals: [https://github.com/peeldao/proposals/tree/main/proposals](https://github.com/peeldao/proposals/tree/main/proposals)\n\n- Peel ‘Proposals’ Discord channel: [https://discord.com/channels/939317843059679252/940041243491201055](https://discord.com/channels/939317843059679252/940041243491201055)\n\n## Risks\n\n- Peel doesn’t use funds effectively.\n\n- Peel’s projects don’t live up to expectations.\n\n## Timeline\n\nThis proposal should take effect in FC 28.\n\nPeel should be removed from recurring payouts from FC 35 (after six cycles), unless superseded by another proposal.\n\n\n---\n[Discussion Thread](https://discord.com/channels/775859454780244028/873248745771372584/1002107727390187571) | [IPFS](https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmNMj9rE5RGgBVJ1enLe8oLCd88BaCJpFKULMqqU8cPJNn)",

A small JBX grant to each team will diversify governance power and increases these active builders’ sense of belonging in the JBDAO community. \n\nTo be eligible for the JBX grant, teams will have to fill out a hackathon feedback form. Teams that do not fill out the form will not be eligible for the distribution.\n\nBy measuring the grant recipient’s participation in future votes, we will also be able to test whether hackathon participation is a meaningful qualifier for receiving JBX grants in future. This will be relevant information if we run more hackathons and give JBX rewards in future.\n\n## Specification\n\n- Create a feedback form for hackathon participants ([done](https://notionforms.io/forms/post-hackathon-questionnaire)). \n\n- Teams that complete the form (at least one member) by the end of FC#27 will be eligible for the 50k JBX airdrop. @Zom_bae and @nicholas will keep track of who has filled out the form and will communicate this information to the multisig at the end of FC#27.\n\n- Multisig distributes 50k JBX to each project that has fulfilled the above criterion during FC#28.\n\nNine teams participated; the max distribution is 450K $JBX. JBDAO multisig has 213M $JBX.\n\nFailure state: If for any reason this proposal is not executed before the end of FC#29, this proposal is canceled and the JBX is de-allocated. \n\n## Risks\n\n- We could mess up the distribution transaction\n\n- Participants could insta-liquidate the JBX\n\n- Participants could not participate in governance\n\n- Reserved list members could feel slighted\n\n## Timeline\n\nMultisig should execute the transaction to distribute 50k $JBX to each team that has completed the feedback form at the start of FC#28. Zom and Nicholas will communicate this list to the multisig at the end of FC#27.\n\n\n---\n[Discussion Thread](https://discord.com/channels/775859454780244028/873248745771372584/1000191139653107793) | [IPFS](https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmXanPVK2Q5RQ5Dg9DMDtqCc2dYKykEBXTqWyD8UYtDJoM)",

Vote requirements in gnosis shall remain the same.\n\n## Rationale\n\nThere is no formal policy in place for the reimbursment of gas fees for multisig members for multisig executed transactions. This process formalizes the existing process and adds gulan to the multisig as an additional option in transaction creation and will ensure the tracking of transaction status’s and records.\n\n## Risks\n\nThe preferred address of the user may change. \n\nThe price of ETH could change between configuration and execution resulting in either too much or too little eth being sent to the multisig for reimbursement. Like all multisig transfer, this will either require the multisig to use unallocated funds from the multisig wallet to cover the increase, or create unallocated funds that sit in the mutisig wallet that could be better utilized in the treasury or other investments.\n\n## Timeline\n\n ASAP if passed via snapshot\n\n\n---\n[Discussion Thread](https://discord.com/channels/775859454780244028/873248745771372584/1002665926656798820) | [IPFS](https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmaqAv58MPmTWyTdV2GdnfzAyFg3sDJnJJno7Q26QcDzc7)",

I did no receive payouts for FC#26 or FC#27. The one time JBX compensation futher alligns my incentives to the overall health of the DAO. As bookkeeper I generally try to avoid snapshot voting as doing so may put strain on persons who I otherwise attempt to advise, and avoid even the appearance of any type of maliciousness in the execution of bookkeeping. As a result of this, I have not fully participated in airdrops. I was also not included in the 1 mil airdrop in JBP-153.\n\n## Risks\n\nI could stop doing the work or the money could go to something better or in a treasury.

      "content": "\n \n```plain text\nAuthor: Jango\nDate: (2022-07-15)\n```\n\n## Thesis\n\nJuiceboxDAO should be prepared to migrate to updated `JBController`s as needed for security purposes. Its project ownership structure around a 9 of 14 multisig is sufficient to prevent unwarranted changes from taking effect without consent from protocol contributors especially concerned with risk and security.\n\nThis should be assumed until a proposal is approved to explicitly turn the `allowsSetController` flag to false.\n\n## Motivation\n\nJuiceboxDAO recently sponsored a Code4rena contest to find issues with the protocol’s codebase. The response was overwhelmingly positive with no existential changes needed, however there are a handful of security adjustments the DAO will be better off making soon, all of which re-enforce that the protocol will work as documented. These may involve migrating controllers.\n\n## Specification\n\n- Configure funding cycle #6 to `allowSetController` in the funding cycle’s metadata.\n\n- Allow the multisig to submit a transaction to migrate controllers.\n\n- Allow the multisig to submit a transaction to migrate ETH payment terminals.\n\n## Rationale\n\nIt is important for the multisig to have discretionary powers over protocol contract migrations so it can act quickly if security vulnerabilities are discovered. This can be relaxed once the protocol stabilizes after further security reviews and audits, so as to restore full control to direct votes by JBX members.\n\n## Risks\n\nThere is smart contract risks any time we introduce new code to depend on, however this already the case with the current code we depend on. The purpose of this proposal is to mitigate risks disproportionately to introducing new risks. \n\n## Timeline\n\nThis discretionary power should last until a future proposal is approved to flip the metadata flag back to `false`.\n\n\n---\n[Discussion Thread](https://discord.com/channels/775859454780244028/873248745771372584/997582472386728016) | [IPFS](https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmcAMqjkVutm1Upph5QriabUENb6FCTThStPXTe9o2NBJx)",

      "content": "\n \n```plain text\nAuthor: Tankbottoms.eth\nDate: 2022-07-15\n\n```\n\n## Thesis\n\nRenew Tankbottoms' $16,000 recurring payout until FC#33 to support efforts in the following arenas: frontend, backend, smart contract development, ux designs, application features, and legal support both with dao, its law firm and with online documentation.\n\n- continued design and UX work regards to additional features for the Juicebox application\n\n- continued development of NFT tooling both UX and Cloud Functions\n\n- continued development of NFT, multi-token treasury smart contracts\n\n- continued development of 3rd party payment processing service for Juicebox contributions (to result in a new treasury for fiat onramp fees)\n\n- continued development of Legal Resources online documents and materials\n\n- continued development of on-chain Banny for veBanny and Bannyverse - [https://app.bannyverse.xyz](https://app.bannyverse.xyz/) for the Bannyverse application\n\n- continued support of legal opinion, agreements and other legal documents for the DAO, and for its members.\n\n## Motivation\n\nJuicebox needs Tank because he provides value in UX, front-end design, back-end cloud functions and smart contracts. Tankbottoms additionally understand legal documents and statues and applies this knowledge to support legal efforts by the service provider for the DAO, documents and templates the DAO may use and distribute to its members, and ultimately provide a legal resources section to info.juicebox.money.\n\n## Specification\n\nDistribute $16,000 USD worth of ETH to tankbottoms.eth each funding cycle.\n\n## Rationale\n\nOver the last 6 funding cycles, tankbottoms has worked with the dao-lawfirm.eth to better focus the legal arguments and rational for the DAO and its onboarding of its contributors for a legal opinion letter. Tankbottoms has been contributing (with natasha-pankina.eth leading on the UX) within Figma for the Juicebox application from restructuring how the treasury tooling expands to additional features, vesting, nft creation (images, music, p5.js, video), nft marketplace, nft on-chain tooling, off-chain tooling (represented in cloud functions), non-metamask account access, 3rd party payment processing, and Ethereum purchasing.\n\nTankbottoms has also been writing a new Legal Resources section for info.juicebox.money which breaks out all the types of project types, incorporated or unincorporated, to include descriptions, templates, and downloadable resources to better help projects understand how to structure their projects.\n\nTankbottoms developed and supported the work with the dataSourceDelegate handling DAI treasuries, nft rewards, payment tiers, tokenUriResolver for both onchain assets and off-chain assets, Banny onchain assets for veBanny, Bannyverse, as well as the BannyVerse.xyz application.\n\nThere certainly are other things forgotten since this is being written 30 mins before the submission cutoff.\n\nStuff to look at.\n\n- [nft creation workflows](https://bleeding-edge.juicebox.wtf/minter)\n\n- [sign-on, Ethereum wallet auto-creation](https://identity-6f036.web.app/)\n\n- [figma ux designs](https://bit.ly/3OZjKB4)\n\n- [app.bannyverse.xyz](https://app.bannyverse.xyz/)\n\n- [github bannyverse.xyz](https://github.com/tankbottoms/bannyverse-app)\n\n- [vebanny on-chain](https://rinkeby.looksrare.org/collections/0x4c1d6F380419a5Dd599126e22dcf1638FE6d40b2)\n\n- [github banny-on-chain](https://github.com/tankbottoms/vebanny-bannyverse-on-chain)\n\n- [legal supplement](https://github.com/jbx-protocol/juice-docs-v2/tree/feature/legal-supplement)\n\n- [additional upcoming potential JB features](https://github.com/cptspacecadet/juice-contracts-v2/branches)\n\nOver the next 6 funding cycles, Tankbottoms will ...\n\n- develop the full nft cloud function processing backend\n\n- continue development of the nft creation workflow\n\n- ship veBanny on-chain resources and assets\n\n- support any additional nft efforts for the DAO\n\n- finish Legal Resources section for info.juicebox.money\n\n- help dao-lawfirm.eth deliver all the opinion letters\n\n- work on a website which allows for credit/debit card payments to Juicebox projects\n\n- possibly figure out a legal framework for the DAO and its partners\n\n## Risks\n\n- Massive payout, especially since Ethereum is tanking. (see what I wrote)\n\n- Keeping payouts in the v1 treasury may increase managerial/bookkeeping work.\n\n- Tankbottoms may do nothing and the DAO gets no meaningful value from the payout, or worse, Tankbottoms stirs shit and creates more distractions which causes the DAO to expend more resources to managing the ensuing cluster.\n\n- Tankbottoms is a complete idiot.\n\n## Timeline\n\nUnless superceded by another proposal, remove this payout to tankbottoms.eth in FC#33.\n\n\n---\n[Discussion Thread](https://discord.com/channels/775859454780244028/873248745771372584/997647977273376808) | [IPFS](https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmeuqV1ojgsvWYBX1hvLthjdzuNiPkLbihi7MBabp2X8pJ)",

      "content": "\n \n## **Thesis:**\n\nJuicebox needs to explore content creation strategies in order to improve visibility, attract new project creators, and drive protocol growth. We are proposing to achieve this through accessible, entertaining, and educational case studies of successful and emerging projects being built on Juicebox. By leveraging the network effect of JB projects and their communities, we can help spread the _juicy_ word and achieve wider adoption.\n\nWe both have experience producing web3 native content for DAOs including podcasts, interviews, articles, blog posts, and Twitter Spaces. Our contributions have helped build brand awareness, community, and engagement through the production of high-quality, fresh content that doesn’t feel too corporate. We have been committed members of the Juicebox ecosystem since March and would like to become dedicated contributors in this fruity menagerie.\n\n## **Abstract:**\n\nWhile Juicebox is dedicating most of its resources to development, we also need to find ways to reach new users and increase project creation. One of the most difficult challenges facing Juicebox is mental models: what is Juicebox and how do we explain it to users who aren’t already familiar? One of the ways that we can approach this problem is through case studies of existing JB projects, which works both to promote use cases of the protocol and support projects currently being built on top of it.\n\nWe are proposing a recurring payout to contribute to storytelling, education, and improving Juicebox’s visibility through a series of podcasts and articles. Together, these materials will spread more awareness about JB projects, inspire new project creation through the success of past projects, and help explain how JB works to newcomers with concrete examples and use cases.\n\n## **Motivation:**\n\nOver the last few months, we have consistently produced content about Juicebox and contributed to discussions about growing the protocol’s visibility. Balancing JB’s headless brand approach with the need for a solid marketing strategy is challenging and we feel a sense of urgency to increase the intensity of our output to help drive protocol growth. \n\nWe would like to direct our attention fully towards JB as dedicated contributors carrying increased responsibility within the DAO. To reflect this increased intensity and commitment, JBDAO should recognize these efforts with a recurring payout that will allow us to devote the time needed to carry out the proposed _delicious_ deliverables.\n\n## Recent Work:\n\n🎙 [The Juicecast](https://anchor.fm/thejuicecast) is a cultural anthropology of Juicebox featuring interviews with community members building and maintaining projects using the protocol. We are responsible for all production tasks from interview prep, scheduling guests, co-hosting, editing, audio engineering, and Twitter campaigns. We have taken a portion of our payouts and invested in more audio equipment—additional microphones, audio software, acoustic treatment—to ensure that our productions are very high quality.\n\nHere are the podcasts that we have already published:\n\n🦈 [The Nouns ecosystem and sub-DAOs with Dropnerd from Shark DAO](https://anchor.fm/thejuicecast/episodes/Ep--5---Dropnerd-from-SharkDAO-e1i7i5q/a-a7ssqvd)\n\n🕵️‍♂️ [A deep-dive into the Juicebox sleuths DrGorilla and Zhape from Moody’s DAO](https://anchor.fm/thejuicecast/episodes/Ep--6---DrGorilla-and-Zhape-from-Moodys-DAO-e1irban/a-a7vg8g1)\n\n🚀 [The crypto space race with Pablo and Kori from Moon DAO](https://anchor.fm/thejuicecast/episodes/Ep--7---Pablo-and-Kori-from-Moon-DAO-e1jcuei/a-a81oklt)\n\n🏗 [Lexicon Devils and metaverse architecture](https://anchor.fm/thejuicecast/episodes/Ep--8-Peacenode-and-Wackozacco-from-Lexicon-Devils-e1l3k94/a-a884kvo)\n\n✍🏻 In addition to the [Juicecast](https://anchor.fm/thejuicecast), we have contributed to the JB blog by writing about projects as case studies of what can be successfully built on Juicebox. Our goal with these articles is to increase the searchability and visibility of projects in order to help them succeed, and to educate readers about what Juicebox makes possible.\n\nWritten content that we have published on the Juicebox blog:\n\n🏗 [Lexicon Devils: A metaverse Architecture Guild](https://info.juicebox.money/blog/2022-07-14-lexicon-devils)\n\n🦈 [SharkDAO: A Sub-DAO Raising Funds to Participate in the Nouns Ecosystem](https://info.juicebox.money/blog/2022-07-18-sharkdao)\n\nIn addition to our role as content creators, we have made an effort to contribute to Juicebox in other ways. Miscellaneous tasks so far have included:\n\n🏦 Maintaining the [Ongoing Contributor Payouts](/c51c3d59c21445988f17c9332b7163dc?v=5c457b4e49f84dceb3fca8b10aa66132) table on Notion\n\n🥈 A worthy competitor to Zom_Bae in the gm channel\n\n## Future work:\n\n🎙️ We’ll continue producing the [Juicecast ](https://anchor.fm/thejuicecast)as a storytelling vehicle for projects and communities built on the protocol. Going forward, we would also like to cross-post this content to YouTube/Vimeo to better optimize searchability and increase the reach of projects as well as the podcast itself. Here are a few podcast episodes that we have in the pipeline:\n\n🧃 Reflections on 1 year of the Juicebox protocol with Jango, Peri, and early contributors\n\n🃏 Bottom-up, on-chain governance with JokeDAO\n\n📜 A retrospective 2-part deep dive on ConstitutionDAO\n\n🍊 The frontend wizards of Peel managing a DAOified product team on Juicebox\n\n✍🏻 Alongside the [Juicecast](https://anchor.fm/thejuicecast), we’ll continue writing long-form content that uplifts JB projects, leverages their communities to spread the JB meme, and demonstrates clear use cases for the protocol. Here are a few articles that we have in the pipeline:\n\n🚀 How MoonDAO is decentralizing space exploration and research through Juicebox\n\n🎨 TileDAO: a community-owned NFT project built on Juicebox\n\n📜 A ConstitutionDAO post-mortem: the story behind raising $42M on Juicebox\n\n## **Risks:**\n\n- Not producing enough content to justify the increased payout amount\n\n- Recurring payouts should be weighed seriously given market conditions\n\n## **Specification:**\n\nAdd $1500 USD recurring payout from [FC#27](https://www.notion.so/cc27c26909ce4f608aa73b20c8e41c00) to [FC#33](https://www.notion.so/dac5c02da79c490b8078ccc24261fcd0) to matthewbrooks.eth\n\nAdd $1500 USD recurring payout from [FC#27](https://www.notion.so/cc27c26909ce4f608aa73b20c8e41c00) to [FC#33](https://www.notion.so/dac5c02da79c490b8078ccc24261fcd0) to brileigh.eth\n\n## **Rationale:**\n\nOur previous trial payouts were $1000 USD each for [matthewbrooks.eth](https://www.notion.so/f2e36c73f12a4fddaceb4bcb35c6c9ff) and [brileigh.eth](https://www.notion.so/082e9b5acc1c457d9f379f8815505e1c) per FC for all podcast related production tasks. To recognize our increased output, we are requesting $1500 USD each per FC to allow us to devote the time needed to JB. This rate is taking into account current market conditions while also reflecting our added workload. \n\nWe are confident that we can bring long-term value to the JB ecosystem as dedicated contributors building a storytelling machine that 🍌 ap-peels 🍌 to new project creators, increases visibility, and builds stronger community.\n\n## **Timeline:**\n\nThis proposal will take effect from [FC#27](https://www.notion.so/cc27c26909ce4f608aa73b20c8e41c00) to [FC#33](https://www.notion.so/dac5c02da79c490b8078ccc24261fcd0).\n\nThroughout and especially towards the end of this recurring payout, we will look back honestly at what has worked, what hasn’t, and determine the direction that will be most beneficial to JB going forward.\n\n\n---\n[Discussion Thread](https://discord.com/channels/775859454780244028/873248745771372584/997582471388471407) | [IPFS](https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/Qmc1p6S2g5368da54ECXibwZTFiMRncVBNz4CNWWuJSfJp)",

      "content": "\n \n```plain text\nAuthor: Jango\nDate: (2020-07-15)\n```\n\n## Thesis\n\nThe new Juicebox protocol is public and already being used by over a hundred projects. As much as I’d like for the work to be complete so I can move on to building _on_ the protocol instead of building out the protocol itself, recent efforts to audit/secure the codebase, create well-known procedures to migrate a project’s ops between treasury versions, and create templates for its extension have proven the time for that is not yet now. \n\nJuiceboxDAO should continue investing in vulnerability mitigation, the ability for projects to evolve given the availability of new features and the exposition of new risks, and the documentation of extensions through examples deployed to production to solve real needs. I’d like to continue leading these efforts alongside our cast of developers and communicators, and would appreciate support from the DAO inline with how it has been supporting over this past chapter, both financially and in work throughput (shouts DrGorilla and all other engineers for being such good partners for testing and prepping ideas for show time).\n\n## Motivation\n\nThe development of the protocol is headed in the right direction and I’m optimistic that we’re tending towards stability and self-serving documentation and operations. My goal is to get us there safely and with broad alignment from the Juicebox community. The motivation for this proposal is out of necessity to adhere to the DAO’s governing guidelines, I’d like for the DAO to continue entrusting me to work towards a point where my work is no longer needed, whatever that takes. Any momentary expansion of responsibilities and workload is with this goal in mind.\n\n## Specification\n\nContinue payouts of $21k per FC to project #55 from the Juicebox DAO’s v2 treasury.\n\n## Rationale\n\nIt’s been working so far. This allocation has thus far supported the construction and deployment of the Juicebox V2 protocol, the Juicebox technical documentation, the mitigation of consequences from discovered bugs and inefficiencies, and the transition of ops from our v1 treasury to our v2 treasury. \n\n## Risks\n\nIt’s a lot of money that could be better spent elsewhere, or kept in reserves to spend at later times.\n\n## Timeline\n\nAs soon as possible.\n\n\n---\n[Discussion Thread](https://discord.com/channels/775859454780244028/873248745771372584/997578518500225164) | [IPFS](https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmUg2kTV7iHGXiDfmBc3YdfvyYj7Xbx59WBw7TL4qaFzAa)",

Otherwise a payout to the multisig will need to be created during the next upcoming funding cycle.\n\n\n---\n[Discussion Thread](https://discord.com/channels/775859454780244028/873248745771372584/995117709371125881) | [IPFS](https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmcYtqpa3nh3qFvXHKGo1tb7y7n4BwBjN7KLmzm2ouFNro)",

      "content": "\n \nAuthor: Felixander\n\nSponsor: tankbottoms\nDate: 2022-07-15\n\n## Thesis:\n\nJuicebox needs to continue making inroads into project-creator outreach through mixed media content. Felixander wants to continue in the role of building out Juicebox’s blog and embarking on architecting and populating Juicebox High, the juiciest repository of knowledge for prospective project creators. The DAO should renew Felixander’s payout with an added increase of $1000 per funding cycle, to reflect the greater commitment that Felixander has put into both the blog and marketing efforts in general, for a total of $3000 per funding cycle.\n\n## Abstract:\n\nJuicebox is in an excellent position to expand its messaging and to try to equip potential project creators with all tools necessary to create excellent projects. A major area of this expansion in messaging will center around Juicebox High, which will serve as the eventual home of the blog, project creation use-case scenarios, project-creation tooling explanations, tips and tricks, and archival material highlighting previous noteworthy projects. Juicebox is also in a unique position to establish a more clear and user-friendly onboarding flow by updating its project creation page and copy, and by linking out to various engaging resources. Felixander has been working in all of these efforts, and looks forward to continuing this work, for instance (examples below) by building out JB High with mixed media resources such as articles, videos, and infographics, among much more!\n\n## Motivation:\n\nThis recurring payout renewal will allow Felixander to continue to work on these projects, and hopefully to have them complete in time for his next payout renewal in FC 34. A lot of the beginning work has been completed or is in progress, such as ideating the need for JB High, creating awesome infographics with the artistic help of Sage (thank you Sage!), establishing a need for smoother onboarding/project creation flow by reaching out to several core contributors. Now is the time to put a lot of the pieces together and build the thing. I want to build the thing.\n\n## Risks:\n\nI might just never do this work, or fuck off to Hawaii and sit on the beach side (you are all welcome to join if that happens!), or I may do the work badly. I hope you all have enough faith in me in this endeavor, but nothing is certain and that’s definitely a risk.\n\n## Specification:\n\nExtend Felixander’s payout for seven more funding cycles, expiring at FC#33. Increase Felixander’s payout to $3000 per funding cycle from the current $2000 per funding cycle.\n\n## Rationale & examples of work:\n\nI’ve been spearheading a lot of this, and so I feel like I’m in a great position to finish this work, and I also feel like it falls squarely into my areas of expertise. To be clear this is a team effort, and I can’t thank enough everyone who has helped me so far, but I have a vision for how JB High can work and what needs it can fill, and so far people seem to have been receptive to it, so I want to build that. In terms of the blog, my recent market-facing blog posts are continually dominated the blog traffic, and recent data on fathom suggests that those posts have had a positive SEO impact. So I think I am at least competent at the job, and looking forward to execute. I have added a higher payout and truth be told am self-conscious about this, since I know we are in a bear market. I am open to keeping my payout as it was, at $2000 per FC, if enough feel like that is more appropriate. The reason I am asking for an increase is that my role and commitment has increased significantly. For a recap of the work I’ve done and am doing, see below:\n\n\n- Streamlining workflows - creating translation shared glossary to ensure that all our translated content meets professional criteria. I’ve been working on this with the translation team on and off for a while. [Document here.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LUt1jDaeuWQMFeUJhnal7Ja_BE6PkiFHcA65u932IEk/edit?usp=sharing) The goal is that this would eventually be published on JB High as a resource for all translators of web3 content (whether they work with us or not).\n\n- Creating infographics with Sage to help make engaging content around JB tooling. Examples [here](https://discord.com/channels/775859454780244028/868159148544634880/994350885989777590), and [here](https://discord.com/channels/775859454780244028/984526928516116580/985955145160458260) (also will post partial clip of this last one below!).

JB in the Words Of etc. The most recent article on Mieos can be found [here](https://info.juicebox.money/blog/juicebox-in-the-words-of-mieos). The next interview to drop will be Mr. Goldstein, and that will be published next week!\n\n- Creating market-facing JB tooling explainers, JB platform explainers, and articles designed to increase SEO and engagement on the JB website. Examples of articles can be found [here](https://info.juicebox.money/blog/the-power-of-token-minting-explained) (this was the first of a 5-article series, with more to come!). Regarding SEO, here is the last 30 days of activity. You can see that the blog posts are doing well. SEO is a crawl, not a sprint, but these numbers are encouraging.\n\n\t- My articles were published July 2nd. For image 2, in the last 30 days, the two market-facing articles have been the most-trafficked. Numbers are very small but encouraging.\n\n\t![](https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/b3ba1074-03d5-4c15-9760-8d8efa4dde8f/Screen_Shot_2022-07-14_at_3.29.05_PM.png?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Content-Sha256=UNSIGNED-PAYLOAD&X-Amz-Credential=AKIAT73L2G45EIPT3X45%2F20220719%2Fus-west-2%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20220719T000031Z&X-Amz-Expires=3600&X-Amz-Signature=5ab4219ac6bcc9e80828b58681dcd6cb2489efdf4a92e2b2bedeab2f61882a75&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&x-id=GetObject)\n\n\t![](https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/95d35e2b-b8b0-417e-a065-9e0826b3a462/Screen_Shot_2022-07-14_at_3.29.25_PM.png?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Content-Sha256=UNSIGNED-PAYLOAD&X-Amz-Credential=AKIAT73L2G45EIPT3X45%2F20220719%2Fus-west-2%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20220719T000031Z&X-Amz-Expires=3600&X-Amz-Signature=121e9163b3b2a468463ecd18ef9d84119150dff1b740387471df36eb37b727d1&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&x-id=GetObject)\n\n## Timeline:\n\nThis is a recurring payout renewal so it will renew my payouts at a new amount.\n\n## Gratitude:\n\nThis is my first payout renewal request, and I want to take a moment and thank you all for welcoming me into the community, and for being patient with many n00b questions that I had. Tank you so much tankbottoms for sponsoring! Particularly want to thank filipv, who onboarded me onto JB, and has been a mentor through and through. And also huge shout out to Wagmi, which was my first real web3 family.

      "title": "JBP-216 - Streamlining translations at JB",
      "content": "\n \n### Thesis\n\nJuicebox needs to streamline efficiency and save ETH where possible in the bear market. There are opportunities to do this where translations are concerned. Felixander will put a system into place to efficiently translate important documents and website interfaces. Felixander is a good candidate for this effort as he has previous experience working with translators IRL, both in a managerial capacity and also as a translator.\n\n### Specification\n\nThe translation workflow has recently come under some scrutiny because of what appears to be inefficient operational and bookkeeping strategies. An overhaul of the translation department to rely less on human oversight and more on procedural automated steps will both save ETH, save the room for human error, and ensure quality translations are happening expediently. Specifically, moving translations to Crowdin so that they can be automated and so that we can have more control over what specifically is allowed to be translated is essential. This would also include shutting down DeWork as a translation platform. Additionally, having a review-system in place to ensure that translations are checked for accuracy is needed. Chinese-language translation, which needs special care and expediency to service the large number of Chinese JB members, would receive priority attention. Lastly, a system whereby translators can receive work without them having to fight amongst themselves will go a long way in promoting a prosocial environment within the translators channel.\n\n### The workflow\n\nThe main things Juicebox should be prioritizing for translation is the website front-end (mostly done) and the “Learn” section of the [info.juicebox.money](http://info.juicebox.money). Most of the front-end interface has already been translated, but most of the “Learn” section has not. These are the two entry points to Juicebox and should be translated in the major languages. We have a lot of the website translated, but should still consider adding major world languages like Hindi and Japanese (market research will dictate which languages to focus on). This is a one-time work project, not an ongoing workflow. My suggestion is that we hire one excellent translator from each of these languages to translate the entire front-end and “Learn” section, and then review that carefully with other translators of the same language. The “Learn” section is currently not translated in any language, and we should decide which languages we want that translated into.\n\nOnce that is complete, most ongoing translation at JB will cease until we are in a better market where justifying such ongoing payment makes more sense. The only ongoing work after the front-end is translated would be Chinese, so that we can further support the Mandarin-speaking members of our community.\n\nOver the long-term, this will save a lot of the translation budget, which is valuable ETH in such harsh market conditions. Also, it will trend toward near-zero oversight, meaning that current payouts around translation can be reduced and eventually eliminated. In the short term, this system will cost far less than the current system.\n\n### Specific changes to be discussed:\n\n- Felixander will manage translations to ensure that only the most pertinent documents are translated and uploaded expediently\n\n- Felixander will work to do an accounting of what current translation jobs are finished, incomplete, ready-to-be-published, etc., to make sure that we can maximize the work that has been done so far\n\n- Felixander will give information to bookkeeping department regarding payouts and work completed, so that an efficient ETH disbursement workflow can take place for translators to be paid.\n\n- Felixander will put a review process in place to ensure that translations are reviewed and that translations are high quality.\n\n- We should decide which languages are the most important to be used to translate the JB front-end “Learn” section and main interface. The front-end has several languages already, but the “Learn” section should be translated at least into some of the major languages\n\n### Point of consideration for future translation jobs\n\nSome ongoing translation will happen from time to time, but the idea is that this work is not ongoing indefinitely, but rather project based. For instance, Felixander is working on some blog posts that are meant to market JB, or the current blog posts by JohnnyD that explain NFT tooling, should be translated into major non-English languages. This can be achieved easily through Crowdin on a per-need basis.\n\n### Requesting payout increase amount\n\nTruth be told, I’m not sure how much work this project will entail, and thus I am hesitant to assign an amount to it. I would like to get started on this, put a good system in place, and at that time try to determine the commitment required for the role. At that point I’ll write another proposal that is up for a vote.\n\n### The context\n\nThis is a discussion proposal. The goal is for the community to discuss and come to agreement on the ideas in this proposal. If there are ways to take part of this proposal to improve existing translation procedures, then all the better. If we decide that this proposal should replace the entire existing translation department, then so be it. The goal is to have meaningful discussion openly and transparently to improve a system that does not appear to be working properly.\n\n### By the numbers\n\nThe “learn” section currently has about has about 4,000 words in it between the Overview, Risks and Glossary sections (arguably the most important sections to have in other languages. That equates to a $400 translation job at $0.10 per word per language. This work would need to be review, which at the current rate of $0.05 per word would come out to $600 per language. If we are putting these into five languages, we would have a budget of about $3,000 to execute this task.\n\nMy blog articles (five article series) so far are about 4000 words in total, which means that translations plus review would come out to about $600 per language. If we are doing Hindi, Russian, Chinese, Japanese and French, that would come out to $3,000 in total to translate those articles into each of those 5 languages.\n\nTo put all this into perspective, the last cycle of translators’ budget was over $5,000, over $4,000 of which was for work that has zero utility for us and that is currently being audited. With that amount of money we could have nearly translated both the entire pertinent “learn” sections of Juicebox as well as most of the market-facing blog articles. Instead, we have not done either as far as I am aware.\n\n\n---\n[Discussion Thread](https://discord.com/channels/775859454780244028/873248745771372584/992564427226365972) | [IPFS](https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmYa4n23b3dR5mTKzjQCCn5sYNQ6metgrvxMBBpA8K8enK)",

      "content": "\n \n```plain text\nTitle: Create Recurring Payout for jigglyjams\nAuthor: jigglyjams\nDate: 2022-06-29\n```\n\n## **Thesis:**\n\nThe governance process is essential to the operation of a DAO. Juicebox DAO needs governance automation in order to ensure proposals are carried from idea to execution in an accurate and timely manner. Jigglyjams developed a platform called nance and it successfully carried proposals through the stages of governance for the past 5 funding cycles, making jigglyjams the most qualified member to perform this task. To further the development of nance, JuiceboxDAO should pay jigglyjams $4,800 per funding cycle for FC#26-32.\n\n## **Abstract:**\n\nIf you are reading this proposal, you understand how important governance is to JuiceboxDAO. In order for JB to adapt and change for the better, members of the DAO have the unique opportunity of proposing, discussing, and voting on what changes to execute upon. Each stage of governance has different requirements and thus uses a different type of communication platform. JB's governance tech stack is built on Notion, Discord, Snapshot, and Gnosis Safe.\n\n## **Motivation:**\n\nIn the past, filipv and stevie g were the governance facilitators for the DAO and would manually shuttle data between the gov tech stack. With the development of nance, this is no longer necessary.\n\nWhen a proposal is submitted to Notion, nance detects it, posts in Discord, and starts a discussion thread in order for DAO members to provide their opinions. At the start of the Temperature Check phase of governance, nance creates a simple Discord reaction based poll for each of the active proposals. At the end of the Temperature Check phase, nance counts the Discord reactions and submits all proposals that have passed to Snapshot for the Offchain Voting phase of governance. Once Offchain Voting is complete, nance checks Snapshot votes and updates the Notion database, and then sends a message with the results to Discord. See [flow diagram](https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmZ4kNCBqCYUoNj7FNYGU1PdhUeiBzq3ur8LmgABjrwWxv) for more details and [#governance-automation](https://discord.com/channels/775859454780244028/955977240787685416) channel in discord for active updates on the platform.\n\nAutomating this process has had several positive effects:\n\n- Freeing up DAO members to perform higher level tasks\n\n- Alerting members of the DAO when and what needs their attention\n\n- Removing human errors in the counting of polls and votes\n\n- Kicking off each stage of governance at the correct time\n\nFurther development of the nance platform is needed in order to bring stability to the code, to add new features (such as codifying payout requests per [jango's request](https://discord.com/channels/775859454780244028/879851197857677372/991004185275293746), adding automatic translation per twodam’s/zhape’s recommendation), and to enhance the platform to be capable of running automated governance for other DAOs.\n\nJigglyjams has been working nights and weekends over the past 3 months, and in July is beginning to commit further to the nance platform. July 6 - August 6 jigglyjams will be winding down commitments at his day job and devoting 20 hours/week to nance. After August 6 jigglyjams will be committing full time to the development of nance.\n\n## **Specification:**\n\nAdd jigglyjams.eth to the JuiceboxDAO recurring payouts at $4,800 for FC#26-32\n\n## **Rationale:**\n\nJigglyjams is taking on risk by leaving his full time job in order to develop the nance platform. The development of nance will be beneficial to JB and the greater DAO ecosystem.\n\n## **Risks:**\n\nThe DAO may not feel that they get the request amount of value out of the nance platform.\n\n## **Timeline:**\n\nThis proposal shall take effect following the FC#26 Snapshot vote and shall end after FC#32\n\n%FC26-32,payout@$4800=>jigglyjams.eth%\n\n\n---\n[Discussion Thread](https://discord.com/channels/775859454780244028/873248745771372584/991935316615233626) | [IPFS](https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmaJeKCsuqkGviU5QUPMXZSZBYm8GnXUrSdt6XsUvQXkx6)",

Send to Jango Bango (project ID 55).\n\n## Abstract:\n\nNow that V1 ⇒ V2 project token migration is being deployed, we can start putting funds into the V2 treasury to manage payouts from.\n\nMove $200k worth of ETH from our V1 treasury to the V2 treasury to manage payouts from, and move the payment directed at jango.eth to be directed at the Jango Bango V2 project.\n\n## Motivation:\n\nI want to start personally managing my stash from a v2 project. I think the DAO is also ready to move payout operations from its v2 treasury.\n\n## Risks:\n\nSlightly more management. We are already managing two reconfigure transactions every 2 weeks (one for v1 treasury and one for our v2 treasury). We only manage payouts from the v1 treasury, so this will add a vector of complexity, but it is one that is inevitable on our journey to deprecate V1. We might as well start sooner so that we can finish sooner.\n\n## Specification:\n\nStep 1:\n\n\tIn the v1 reconfig for FC#25:\n\n\t- Move $200,000 from the v1 treasury to the multisig.\n\n\t- Remove payout to jango.eth.\n\n\tIn the v2 reconfig for FC#4:\n\n\t- Add a payout of $21,000 to project ID 55 (Jango Bango).\n\n\nStep 2: Multisig `addTobalance` the commensurate amount of ETH to the Juicebox DAO v2 treasury anytime during the DAO’s FC#4 on v2 so that the payout can be distributed.\n\n## Rationale:\n\nThe multisig must coordinate between v1 and v2 treasuries. It’s not worth writing and testing componentry to automate this since v1 is being deprecated.\n\n## Timeline:\n\nSee specs.\n\n\n---\n[Discussion Thread](https://discord.com/channels/775859454780244028/873248745771372584/987372909293109248) | [IPFS](https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmSM2zUpxaCGVWRLg6r9VDCMJKuWRvZf9TSUZhT8VU6ndW)",

      "content": "\n \n```plain text\nTitle: Sponsor Development of jokedao v2\nAuthor: seanmc\nDate: 2022-06-16\n```\n\n## Thesis\n\nPay the [jokedao Juicebox project](https://juicebox.money/#/v2/p/39) $40,000 USD to fund 10 weeks of development of V2 of the jokedao platform.\n\n## Abstract\n\nThis proposal’s goal is to provide grant funds to jokedao to enable continued development of [jokedao.io](http://jokedao.io) - the on-chain governance platform that they are building as a public good. Funds will be distributed as milestones are met.\n\n## Motivation\n\nDAO governance *can* be fun, and jokedao has created the platform to enable that. v1 currently has full functionality to mint voting tokens, create contests where anyone can propose, as well as a UI to use those things. v2 will build out the full capacity of jokedao’s extensible contracts, so that it is a truly accessible, powerful public good that DAOs to come use to make decisions and cohere.\n\n## Risks\n\nHonestly the biggest risk is that we run out of funding - give us funding and we _will_ deliver (for evidence of this check out what we [currently have](https://jokedao.io/?linked_contest=0x3aCD536121141BDA3E8C0910E21802DA5Be3fCae&linked_network=polygon) as well as what we’re working on currently [here](https://github.com/seanmc9/JokeDaoV2Dev/tree/next/ui-revamp) and [here](https://sparkling-brook-1496.on.fleek.co/)).\n\n## Specification\n\n### Milestone 1\n\n_Estimated duration: 2 weeks_\n\n_FTE: 240 hours_\n\n- Develop content moderation module\n\n- Enable downvoting, randomization of options with 0 votes, uploading of all times of content (video, music, etc.), ability of contest creators to determine which proposals are visible to a community to vote on\n\n### Milestone 2\n\n_Estimated Duration: 4 weeks_\n\n_FTE: 480 hours_\n\n- Develop tournament module\n\n- Let voters pick between two or more different options in a ‘tournament’ style that gradually creates brackets of winners, so that any given voter doesn’t need to sort through hundreds of proposals but instead can emergently create consensus by only evaluating individual items closely\n\n### Milestone 3\n\n_Estimated Duration: 4 weeks_\n\n_FTE: 480 hours_\n\n- Develop grants proposal module\n\n- Enable proposals to be transactions that can be executed upon completion of the Contest\n\n[_Final UI Prototype_](https://www.figma.com/file/36Qylp4x6N4pK3wXpHCj5A/Untitled?node-id=0%3A1)\n\n\nUpon completion of **milestone 1:**\n\n- Transfer $8,000 USD worth of ETH to the multisig in the next Juicebox DAO funding cycle.\n\n- Multisig to pay the [jokedao Juicebox project](https://juicebox.money/#/v2/p/39) $8,000 USD worth of ETH.\n\nUpon completion of **milestone 2:**\n\n- Transfer $16,000 USD worth of ETH to the multisig in the next Juicebox DAO funding cycle.\n\n- Multisig to pay the [jokedao Juicebox project](https://juicebox.money/#/v2/p/39) $16,000 USD worth of ETH.\n\nUpon completion of **milestone 3:**\n\n- Transfer $16,000 USD worth of ETH to the multisig in the next Juicebox DAO funding cycle.\n\n- Multisig to pay the [jokedao Juicebox project](https://juicebox.money/#/v2/p/39) $16,000 USD worth of ETH.\n\n## Rationale\n\nThe jokedao Juicebox project is already configured to pay out directly to the developers, enabling transparent payroll and runway. Also, when DAOs do emerge from people making decisions together using jokedao, we have no doubts at all with regards to where we’ll send them for treasury management - it is abundantly clear that Juicebox is the place to go for material, comprehensive support for projects that want to be sustainable.\n\nFor Juicebox, anyone can set up a contest to crowdsource user ideas and preferences, and Juicebox could even incentivize these with rewards for voters and winning ideas—saving the expense of user research, drawing attention to the protocol as user-focused, and embracing unique web3 functionality to build a stronger community of Juicebox supporters. Projects like MetricsDAO and Backdrop already are using us for these purposes, and we have a number of projects looking to use us after our site relaunch, including Women Build Web3, Developer DAO, Buidl Guidl (Austin Griffith), Mintsong, Doge NFT, and DreamDAO.\n\nJust as importantly, however, Juicebox could use contests to handle its grants program: anyone could submit a grant proposal through jokedao (rather than airtable), and token holders could vote on their favorites to approve. This again would be a way to incentivize the community to support Juicebox while helping Juicebox collect better data. We're in talks with Seed Club, Forefront, Radar, CityDAO, Radicle, ZKSync, and Gitcoin about developing a grants module they could use for their own grants program as well.\n\n## Copyright Disclaimer\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n\n\n---\n[Discussion Thread](https://discord.com/channels/775859454780244028/873248745771372584/987416705447911455) | [IPFS](https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmZJ7JQMw1QD9oi7wrqfUvC79dE1kYM9ADZemaCV3cePni)",

      "content": "\n \n```plain text\nTitle: Zeugh’s recurring payout for community management and growth\nAuthor: Zeugh\nDate: June 16th\n```\n\n### Summary\n\nCreating a recurring payout of $3900/cycle to Zeugh, for his works community, onboarding, visibility and growth for juiceboxDAO. \n\n\nThis payout will stay for 7 cycles, for a total of $21000 over the course of 98 days, with possible changing, cancelling or extending being only possible trough a new DAO vote. \n\n### Abstract:\n\nFor the past 3 months I’ve focused my efforts on\n\n- Visibility for Juicebox Protocol, recently being the most active person about the protocol on twitter (data from last week [https://twitter.com/safaryclub?s=21&t=Ibcn9uFqBVefDsbHOGQURQ](https://twitter.com/safaryclub?s=21&t=Ibcn9uFqBVefDsbHOGQURQ)), taking JB presence into IRL events, hosting twitter spaces with web3 founders and generally helping promote it\n\n- Support for new members and project creators both on discord, twitter and public chats\n\n- Research of community and growth practices on the DAO ecosystem, which supported the creation of the models being used now to launch the community of ComicsDAO\n\n\n\nFor the next 3 months I will be focusing on:\n\n- Restructuring our community self-onboarding process with web3-native education tooling and better user experience\n\n- Providing support for questions and onboarding on our server and wherever else needed based on the experience with juiceboxDAO and having launched 7 projects myself\n\n- Increasing juicebox visibility trough presence in both digital and physical spaces as well as relations with other DAO ecosystems\n\n- Doing a new clean up of the discord and tooling flow, being mostly channels, roles, bots, verification and security for discord and a better integration with task management for the general tooling\n\n- Improving the analysis of our community data with report generating tools to improve our understanding of user journeys and from there work a better member retention experience\n\n- Supporting new juicebox projects on building their communities by being present in their servers, analyzing their users goals and journeys and providing tips and feedback on what and how to improve.\n\n### Motivation:\n\nOur current process of getting new visibility (mouth to mouth/project to project) paired with the complexity of onboarding yourself to the DAO community, to the governance and to the product, makes our growth slower than what I’d consider ideal. \n\nAlthough it was worth it letting it follow this course during the bull market, I believe the new moment asks for us to improve how we get seen by more people and make it easier for them to join and launch by themselves and help their projects succeed.\n\nI’ve already been doing some of this work in AMA, twitter spaces and irl events and now I want to focus on improving the whole flow from discovery to learning to joining, focusing on project creators but also for people who want to take part on projects already launched.\n\nThis will be done trough:\n\n- Improvement of the self-onboarding flow as described above, using the tooling from DoDao and [101.xyz](http://101.xyz) as support for this where it’s needed, but also with a more paced flow in the onboarding channels\n\n- Active search of new projects in-building that can be benefit from using juicebox, trough the network of projects and project creators that I’ve been getting myself into, offering support and demo for new projectists\n\n- Active search on currently live projects that can benefit from using juicebox and researching the alternatives at the same time, by asking running projects how do they currently manage their treasuries and, if possible to be improved to JB, showing them how it could be done.\n\n- Supporting the early community launch of projects hosted on JB, by providing a broad view of what makes a good community build from 0, ideating on goals and mechanics for rewarding to the members and providing resources and feedback where needed.\n\n- Analyzing our member journeys to map points of improvement to UX and churn, using tools like Kazm and Ahoy to have more clarity on our touch points and where is improvement more important\n\n\nThere are also other areas of current work that will be kept up like the improvement of the current server structure, improvements on our tools for task and information management across members and the constant support for new members and the available helping ~~hand~~ brain for any issue to be solved in the community.\n\n### Specifics:\n\nRecurring payout of $3900 for 7 cycles(25-31) should be made to project 13 of Juicebox v2: [https://juicebox.money/#/v2/p/13](https://juicebox.money/#/v2/p/13)\n\n\n### Risks:\n\nThe improvements in structure that are planned might fail to deliver value as communities are human based and can behave in unpredictable manners, specially in an uncertain market.\n\nThe demand on community support and creation might exceed time availability if we get too many new projects\n\n### Rationale:\n\nThe payout for $3900 going trough the JB project 13 on v2 will be 65% directed to me, 5% reserved for tooling costs and 30% for CanuDAO JB treasury for tooling and community research.\n\n### Timeline:\n\nProposal: June 16th\n\nAll-time: Support for new members, supporting new project with community, irl and online presence talking about JB in events, networking and hosting twitter spaces on relevant community and web3 topics, \n\n \n\nPhase 1: Improvements on current server and task structure\n\nPhase 2: Improvement of the self-onboarding flow\n\nPhase 3: Implementing Analysis tools and defining success KPI for community growth\n\n\nExpiration: September 24nd\n\n## Copyright Disclaimer\n\nCopyright and related

      "title": "JBP-213 - CanuDAO bot development funding proposal",
      "content": "\n \n### Summary:\n\nCanu is going through a technological shift of focus and is seeking to continue the research and development of discord native bots for communities within JB and the like. Canu’s existing bot offers include gm bot, govbot, canuhelper, metabot, soon to be introbot, and a plethora of other bots currently in our pipeline.\n\n### **How have you contributed to the DAO?**\n\n• Currently developing AutoGov and Canuhelper update to incorporate JB V2 data stack.\n\n• Developed and maintains gov bot, gm bot, canuhelper for the JB discord server\n\n• Work closely with key JB admins on understanding bot usage, pain point, and improvement suggestions.\n\n• User research and ideation lead to the creation of Nance - which is now spun off into its own project outside of Canu.\n\n### **Additional Information**\n\n**What is Autogov?**\n\nAutogov is Canu’s newest project to develop a one-stop-shop for everything governance.\nFrom source of truth to voting and executing. Everything will be done through AutoGov. Either via our web-interface or discord. \n\nAutoGov presents some significant technical challenges and usability risk, and Canu will need full cooperation with JB to fully realize its vision.\n\n**What is CanuHelper**\n\nCanuHelper is the helper for JB projects. \nGet all of your JuiceBox data directly on discord, all the info from your treasury, your cycle data as well as getting alerts for payments, redeems and distributions! Great to help your community keep up with your treasury.\n\nCanuHelper is ongoing upgrades to interact with JB V2.\n\n### How do you want to contribute to the DAO going forward**?**\n\n• Continue the development of AutoGov and improving Canuhelper functionality, which includes a Canu dashboard and V2 incorporation.\n\n• Update existing bot infrastructure (particularly gm bot and canuhelper) to reduce downtime and potential bugs.\n\n• Introducing more technical bots such as Github bot per suggestion of Aeolien.\n\n• Increase Canu’s activity in bot ideation, design, prototyping, and productization\n\n• Continue to work closely with JB to receive feedbacks from the community on bots and tools\n\n• Provide technical models and prototypes for JB to try out and gauge product interest\n\n• Work closely with JB projects in providing technical support and development on bots and tools\n\n### **What does success look like for someone taking on your role?**\n\n•  We want to help reduce the operational pain points of navigating between discord and the large amount of different websites.\n\n •  We want to minimize the friction within discord servers and reduce existing churn through the integration of automated bots and tools that can uplift the community experience.\n\n•  JB can focus on growing its protocol and community while not worry about the increase amount of administrative and operation overhead caused by the technical difficulties - Canu will help mitigate that. \n\n• When you no longer need to scroll up to find the needed comments, click on 5 links just to get to the correct call out, and know exactly what is going on which ever channel you go to.\n\n• JB entrust Canu with discord-native bot development and its maintenance.\n\n• Other JB curated DAOs and projects can enjoy the freeware offered by Canu.\n\n### **Under what criteria should the community reassess this payout?**\n\n• When the communication between Canu and JB reduces, when Canu slowed down its product updates. And when @LazerVike decided to hang the cleats.\n\n### Timeline:\n\nProposal: June 16th\n\nAll time: Canu product improvement for JB and JB Projects - working closely with JB to understand UX throughout JB, regardless of seniority. Improve Canu products based on feedbacks and provide general counsel in Canu - JB development interactions.\n\nPhase 1: Delivery of CanuHelper V2 integration\n\nPhase 2: AutoGov MVP \n\nPhase 3: AutoGov integration and improvement\n\n\nExpiration: September 24nd\n\nThis Proposal will last from FC#25 to FC#31.\n\n### Risks:\n\nThe risks are not respecting the ETH. Over-payment for a service someone else could do better for less. Payout for unnecessary human capital\n\n### **Payout recipient:**\n\n@canuDAO\n\n### **Payout amount (needs revision, will advise jango and filipv on this):**\n\n$ = 4000 total per FC, for 3 MOs\n\nSpecifics:\n\n$1000 Phytann (bot development and maintenance: currently migrating Canuhelper data to support V2 JB front end, exploring Canuhelper Dashboard, bot hosting infrastracture)\n\n$1000 Lucas (Full stack dev: main focus was Canu website front end, now working on autogov front end interface and other related front end features)\n\n$700 Lazervike (product and user research, bot ideation and planning, Canu POC for the product team, roadmapping, provide monthly Canu updates)\n\n$1300 Canu internal admin work, graphic design, operational costs, as well as treasury allocation\n\n\n---\n[Discussion Thread](https://discord.com/channels/775859454780244028/873248745771372584/987052324511940698) | [IPFS](https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmYoKcxXChCY398kBFoTDYikwjNeYZ6695VUZFPJ7qib4U)",

      "content": "\n \n```plain text\nTitle: Allow Juicebox DAO v2 treasury to set a new terminal for V1 token exchanges\nAuthor: jango.eth\nDate: 2022-06-17\n```\n\n## Thesis:\n\nWe’re looking to start v1 JBX ⇒ v2 JBX exchanges.\n\n\nIn order to do so, we need to give ourselves to ability to attach a new payment terminal to our v2 treasury. This is a `allowSetTerminals` flag in funding cycle metadata that needs to be set to `true`. Once this reconfiguration takes effect, we need to send a tx to set the terminal, and send a tx in the terminal to specify that we are willing to accept v1 JBX in exchange for v2 JBX.\n\nWe’ve also yet to issue a v2 JBX. We can do so at any time once this proposal passes. In the time being, our v2 tokens will continue being tracked in the `JBTokenStore`. \n\nAs the v1 v2 token parity is granted, the snapshot strategy would then be adapted, allowing v2 token holder to have the same voting power as v1 holders (total voting power would be cumulative).\n\n## Abstract:\n\nWe have a payment terminal in place that projects can attach if they wish to receive their v1 tokens in exchange for their v2 tokens. In order to attach the terminal, projects must explicitly allow setting new terminals to their project. \n\nThis proposal is for JuiceboxDAO to explicitly set this flag to true, to attach the terminal, and to begin accepting v1 JBX in exchange for v2 JBX.\n\n## Motivation:\n\nWe’ve finished writing, reviewing, testing, and documenting a payment terminal to accept v1 tokens in exchange for v2 tokens. Any project that is on both v1 and v2 can use this. Time to attach it and get the tokens flowing through.\n\n## Risks:\n\nWhenever we’re deploying new contracts and prompting people to interact with them, we are opening up smart contract risk vectors assumed by token holders. Tests, documentation, and a simple to use user interface should mitigate these risks.\n\n## Specification:\n\nReconfiguration for FC#25:\n\n- set the `allowSetTerminals` metadata property to `true`.\n\nDuring FC#25:\n\n- Send the `setV1ProjectId` on the `JBV1TokenPaymentTerminal`.\n\n- Call `JBDirectory.setTerminalsOf(...)` to include the current ETH payment terminal and the V1 token terminal.\n\nAnytime once the proposal passes:\n\n- Issue v2 JBX ERC20 token.\n\n- Add the v2 JBX balance to the current snapshot strategy (add a second `contract-call` to  `JBTokenStore.balanceOf(voter, 1)` in the current Snapshot delegate strategy)\n\n## Rationale:\n\nAll steps are standard operating procedure for attaching a new terminal.\n\nThe only opinionated step is to issue V2 JBX ERC-20s, which we do not have to do. The reason for doing so would be to allow for similar functionality as we had with v1 JBX, but we could postpone this decision. \n\n## Timeline:\n\nSee specs.\n\n\n---\n[Discussion Thread](https://discord.com/channels/775859454780244028/873248745771372584/987454839862738994) | [IPFS](https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmVm3m9dVVigrujEDovJS3C4XTnV7sPViGUpJcvYNZrRGA)",

The governance process can let through proposals that the community is not truly enthusiastic about.\n\n- Emergency governance processes are a major outstanding avenue for abuse, and have not been utilized.\n\n- Unclear proposals often lead to confusion and additional work on the multisig’s part.\n\n- The Juicebox DAO Governance Process has inconsistencies and unclear language.\n\n## Risks\n\n- Without a translation buffer, authors could change their proposals just before they go to offchain voting, bypassing the temperature check stage.\n\n- The DAO may miss out on executing controversial but valuable proposals.\n\n- An unforseen event could arise in which emergency governance would be useful.\n\n- Proposals may be more burdensome to write, especially for newcomers.\n\n- Consistency updates could lead to confusion for those used to something else (e.g. Juicebox DAO → JuiceboxDAO).\n\n## Specification\n\n- Ratify this governance process: [https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmdmtcMzPYzfPESPz4hJbqFxsPBqkFKqQcDR7wEgk7AKzt](https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmdmtcMzPYzfPESPz4hJbqFxsPBqkFKqQcDR7wEgk7AKzt)\n\n- Update governance process at [https://info.juicebox.money/resources/juicebox-dao/governance-process](https://info.juicebox.money/resources/juicebox-dao/governance-process)\n\n- Update other documentation accordingly.\n\n## Rationale\n\n- Translators are currently writing proposal summaries, and do not need a full 24 hours to make a translation. There is a possibility of leveraging DeepL’s API to roughly translate proposals automatically.\n\n- A JBX quorum is less susceptible to manipulation. The quorum only measuring affirmative votes prevents the possibility of a proposal passing quorum because you voted no.\n\n- It is difficult to envision a scenario where emergency governance could address a major existential issue, especially given the protocol-level limits on reconfigurations.\n\n- Multisig work and bookkeeping could be simplified with improved proposal specificity.\n\n- Ambiguities lead to confusion and disagreement, especially for newcomers.\n\n## Timeline\n\nThe updated governance process should take effect during the first temperature check after this proposal’s passing on Snapshot.\n\n## Copyright Disclaimer\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n\n\n---\n[Discussion Thread](https://discord.com/channels/775859454780244028/873248745771372584/986445670242209872) | [IPFS](https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmXeJ84JhGSJSJRNVf8WXYChY7igBcm7e4iHmE6A92wMSY)",

With the launch of V2, I propose that we execute on the original proposal of developing a bug bounty of 50 ETH through [Immune.fi](http://Immune.fi), however updated to focus exclusively on V2 protocol (contracts). The program creates an opportunity for devs who discover bugs in the protocol to report them for a reward proportional to bug severity. Without such a program, devs who find bugs can only be sure to profit by executing exploits. \n\n## Risks\n\n- Capital - Juicebox has passed through 2 traditional audits. If there are no bugs, then there is no need for a bug bounty. \n\n- Insufficient size - If a dev finds a bug in V2, they may be motivated to sit on it until a large project raises a massive amount of funds on V2 in the future, when they can exploit it, rather than collecting a portion of the meagre 50 ETH bounty proposed here. Hopefully we can expand the program in future governance proposals to mitigate this risk. \n\n- A bug is exploited in the frontend, and this proposal does not cover frontend bugs\n\n- Implementation details such as which address to send ETH to are left to @nicholas and @Mr. Goldstein. The proposal could fail or underperform because of this lack of specificity in this proposal.\n\n## Specification\n\nFinalize [Immune.fi](http://Immune.fi) bug bounty sponsorship with 50ETH (<1% of the treasury).\n\nDetailed next steps (from ImmuneFi docs):\n\n- Fill out Immunefi questionnaire (currently waiting to receive)\n\n- Immunefi begins drafting up a bug bounty program based on answers to those questions\n\n- After modifications are done, the process is handed over to Immunefi’s launch specialist\n\n- The launch specialist works with JBDAO to figure out the launch time and bounty PR/marketing details\n\nFees\n\n- 10% Immunefi performance fee (charged on top of the payout) for vulnerabilities found paid to ImmuneFi\n\n- No upfront cost\n\n- Projects set their own payout amounts\n\n- Pay rewards in your own token/coin\n\nPost launch steps:\n\n- Update ImmuneFi if we find bugs ourselves, as they will be marked as known issues and ineligible for bounties\n\n**Measurement of Success:**\n\n- This proposal will be successful if a JB v2 bounty for $100k is set up on Immunefi (+ a $10k fee to Immunefi) by the end of July.\n\n**Deadline:** \n\n\tIf the proposal is not executed by the end of July, revoke allocation of $110k to this proposal. A future proposal may reallocate funds to a similar project.  \n\n## Rationale\n\nThe prior proposal was not executed on V1 and V1.1 and should be updated and executed to secure the V2 launch.\n\nThis proposal will be the first time JBDAO creates an official [Immune.fi](http://Immune.fi) bug bounty. If it goes well, we can consider expanding the program, given that 50ETH (~$85,000 at current price), is a tiny bounty program for securing a protocol that has had over $100 million dollars flow through it already. \n\nThe [Immune.fi](http://Immune.fi) bounty differs from the Code4rena proposal and prior audits in purpose. Formal audits are good for a detailed look at the code. Code4rena are great for mobilising a larger number of devs to work through the code and possibly spot bugs that the small teams of dedicated auditors missed. Immune.fi is a bug bounty intended for post-launch. If someone finds a bug, they can either exploit the protocol, or claim the Immune.fi bounty. Each of these serves a different purpose and this is why they each deserve funding.\n\n## Timeline\n\nJune 4-30: Coordinate with Immunefi to prepare bug bounty details\n\nJuly 1-15: Launch bounty (date pending confirmation from Immunefi)\n\n## Copyright Disclaimer\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n\n\n---\n[Discussion Thread](https://discord.com/channels/775859454780244028/873248745771372584/982051720089706508) | [IPFS](https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmeeQQ8AaZZFTgPRfZ7m1M8Yn119LhCWBVjSbQu7TJuuxt)",

      "content": "\n \n```plain text\nTitle: Sponsor Code4rena Audit\nAuthor: Nicholas\nDate:2022-06-02\n```\n\n## Thesis\n\nSponsor a $75k Code4rena audit of the v2 contracts, which will cost $100k plus a $10k deposit that will be refunded upon completion of post-audit evaluation (the Sponsor Task Refund).\n\n## Abstract\n\nSponsor a $75k Code4rena audit of the v2 contracts. This will cost $100k (incl. 25% fee) and also require that the DAO place a $10k deposit that is refunded when we complete the post-audit feedback form. In total the DAO is asked to \n\n## Motivation\n\nJuicebox V2 contract integrity is a top priority for the securing the DAO’s future. This proposal will further bullwark the v2 contracts and also get many skilled devs’ eyes on the contract. \n\nA word on different types of audits and bug bounties: \n\n- Traditional formal audits have an audit firm review the code in detail. Juicebox has already been through two of these. \n\n- A Code4rena audit bounty mobilizes a larger number of devs to work through the code and possibly spot bugs that the small teams of dedicated auditors missed. This is a good thing to do after a formal audit to get more eyes on the code.  \n\n- [Immune.fi](http://Immune.fi) ([Update JBP-42 - JBX Bug Bounty](https://www.notion.so/6b789d545c384776bd92430efff2ef1d)) is a bug bounty intended for post-launch. If someone finds a bug, they can either exploit the protocol, or claim the Immune.fi bounty. \n\n- Each of these serves a different purpose and this is why they each deserve funding.\n\n## Risks\n\nWe spend money that would be better kept in the treasury given the bear market. The audit attracts little attention. The audit is delayed.\n\n## Specification\n\nFull details for operations logistics are included in the [Code4rena agreement](https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmcYSeaREEvdMPCrYeeGNSqtn9zcw6SrQfufQ3rUqX1TmL). The DAO is not required to sign this document, but it details the expectations and responsibilities of all parties. \n\nThe multisig will send 110,000 USDC to 0xC2bc2F890067C511215f9463a064221577a53E10 no later than 20:00 UTC, June 18, 2022. \n\nTo secure the contest dates, the DAO must send 25% of the total (27,500 USDC) to the above address. If an individual member of the DAO pays this money up front to secure the contest time frame, the multisig should reimburse that DAO member directly, then pay the remaining 82,000 USDC to the above address.\n\nComplete Sponsor Refund Tasks within 14 days of contest end to receive $10k refund:\n\n\t> Sponsor shall evaluate the Findings by completing four (4) categories of critical tasks (“Sponsor Tasks”) within fourteen (14) days of the Contest End Date, unless otherwise agreed to in writing by both Parties. The categories of Sponsor Tasks are (i) assess potential duplication of Findings; (ii) independently evaluate severity of individual Findings, (iii) provide brief response to each Finding; and (iv) share steps taken to mitigate Findings if available\n\nContest start date: June 21, 2022\n\nContest end date: June 28, 2022\n\n## Rationale\n\nCode4rena is an audit marketplace. Many participants compete to win an audit bounty. It has a good reputation and is trusted by many top protocols for audit bounties (most recently OpenSea Seaport). \n\nAnother audit would be a wise investment given that Juicebox’s future rides on the integrity and quality of the v2 code. \n\nThis will also attract attention to Juicebox v2 code amongst the elite set of developers competing in audit competitions on Code4rena. It will be a side benefit to be on their radar, and increase familiarity with the protocols mechanisms amonst this rarefied community.\n\nA Code4rena is also a reputationally impactful service provider. It is a mark of quality to be amongst the top tier projects on the site, such as OpenSea, Backd, Alchemix, Aave, Badger, Velodrome, Pooltogether, Tribe, and so on.\n\n## Timeline\n\nCoordinate with Code4rena June 1-14\n\nRun contest June/July, their schedule permitting\n\n## Copyright Disclaimer\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n\n\n---\n[Discussion Thread](https://discord.com/channels/775859454780244028/873248745771372584/982048655970271302) | [IPFS](https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmbjYRhVECsz58jmRTPw3rom5nkqG2YPWUvv6BWhdyby9Y)",

      "title": "JBP-203 - Sponsor Buidl Guidl Juicebox Hackathon",
      "content": "\n```plain text\nTitle: Sponsor Buidl Guidl Juicebox Hackathon\nAuthor: Nicholas and filipv\nDate: 2022-06-03\n```\n\n\n## Thesis:\n\nPay the forthcoming Buidl Guidl Juicebox project $20,000 USD worth of ETH, half of which will be used to sponsor a Juicebox Hackathon.\n\n## Abstract:\n\nThis proposal’s goal is to create a bounty for builders from the Buidl Guidl community to create interesting projects and integrations using scaffold-eth and Juicebox v2. 50% of the funds will be earmarked for bounty participants, while the other 50% will be allocated to an ongoing Buidl Guidl treasury, in the hopes that the BG community embraces Juicebox for future fundraising and treasury management.\n\n## Motivation:\n\nAustin Griffith’s Buidl Guidl is a community of EVM-oriented Web3 builders. [Juicebox.money](http://Juicebox.money) itself was built as a fork of the Buidl Guidl’s renowned Web3 project starter kit, [scaffold-eth](https://github.com/scaffold-eth/scaffold-eth#-scaffold-eth).\n\nThe goal of this proposal is to encourage members of this builder community to become familiar with Juicebox v2 through their favorite activities: building and experimentation on the blockchain!\n\n## Risks:\n\n- No one in the BG community embraces the challenge and no new interesting experiments are created.\n\n- The BG does not find value in the JB treasury and they do not become recurring users (and proponents) of the protocol.\n\n## Specification:\n\n- Distribute $20,000 USD worth of ETH to the Juicebox DAO multisig.\n\n- Once the Buidl Guidl Juicebox project is created, pay that treasury using that ETH. Individuals can also contribute during the lead up to the hackathon.\n\n- Juicebox DAO contributors will coordinate with Buidl Guidl contributors on template repos, public messaging, and promotion in advance of the hackathon from 2022-06-18 00:00 UTC to 2022-06-20 00:00 UTC.\n\n- Specific hackathon criteria to follow. Example projects could include:\n\n\t- A DIY Juicebox scaffold-eth starter kit.\n\n\t- A protocol extension starter kit\n\n\t- A scaffold-eth NFT branch that sends funds to a Juicebox treasury.\n\n\t- An all-in-one [multisig.lol](http://multisig.lol) + Juicebox interface (read+write)\n\n\t- A buidl-guidl-centric dapp for managing the group’s treasury\n\n- Upon completion of the hackathon, half of all funds in the Buidl Guidl treasury will be distributed to hackathon entrants. Voting percentages from a weighted Snapshot vote (using the Buidl Guidl project token) will correspond to a pro rata distribution.\n\n- Buidl Guidl can use remaining funds in this treasury freely—to run future hackathons, to pay for ongoing development costs, or to do something else entirely.\n\nMeasurement of Success:\n\n- This proposal will be successful Buidl Guidl creates a JB treasury, receives $20k from JBDAO, gives $10k away to hackathon participants. The proposal design will be worth pursuing with other partners if it increases juicebox experimentation among BG members, and if BG continues to use JB beyond the hackathon.\n\nDeadline\n\n- If the proposal isn’t executed before the end of July the funds should be deallocated. \n\n## Rationale:\n\nThis specification provides initial utility to the Buidl Guidl project token. Not only will Juicebox DAO be seeding their treasury with funds—we will bring a number of projects into the ecosystem, configure new governance tooling for Buidl Guidl, create tooling for future creators, and have lots of fun :)\n\n## Copyright Disclaimer:\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n\n\n---\n[Discussion Thread](https://discord.com/channels/775859454780244028/873248745771372584/982415621159542836) | [IPFS](https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmdTV5erxxVu9J2CgXzbs3rEFTUnUxpC2nnJiDe3sHCDEX)",

      "content": "\n \n```plain text\nTitle: CanuDAO new recurring payout\nAuthor: Zeugh\nDate: 2022-06-03\n```\n\n## Thesis\n\nExpand CanuDAO’s payout to $12000/cycle so it can invest further in quick community launching processes and tools, hire more people and make it’s products free or more accessible for new JB projects\n\n## Abstract\n\n- Change CanuDAO goals towards juicebox from ( bots + juiceboxDAO community management ) to ( bots + community management + development of easy community launch kit + discount pricing for juicebox new projects that want to hire our community starter service)\n\n- Increase CanuDAO payout from $8000 to $12000\n\n- Make clear on either Discord, docs or website that those resources and services are available\n\n- Make CanuDAO’s coded products(twitter and discord bots and integrations) free for all new juicebox projects\n\n- Make CanuDAO’s human resources dependant products (starter kit community package and others) cheaper for JB projects\n\n## Motivation\n\nCanu wants to expand it’s services towards JuiceboxDAO from bots + community management to add the provision of tools that can make community “zero to reality” easier for JB projects. We already started working on it, and the first two cases are running now on ComicsDAO(JB project) and PlutoView(non JB Project). As this is something that could deeply benefit juicebox if provided broadly and actively to new projects on the protocol by helping them get further reach and success, we’d like to ask for a bigger payout to increase our time available to focus on that.\n\nCanuDAO has grown and our previous model of focusing on outsourcing community managers to projects and getting dev support as needed has changed into **a team of devs, CMs and other contributors that develops community tooling and can help projects to quick launch their communities**.\n\nFor that, Canu would like to update it’s goals in working with Juicebox, from (a) the development and maintenance of bots and (b) the services of Zeugh as community manager, to a new perspective of (1) Zeugh’s service as community manager, (2) development and maintenance of bots, **(3) the development of tooling for autonomous community launch and (4) the free service of minimal community building for new juicebox projects.**\n\nCanu has already been moving in this direction based on the clear need that new projects have after launching their treasuries, we’ve been spending more of our time and resources developing processes and tools to make faster and more automated ways that a community launch from zero to a point where it can start walking by itself.\n\nThose changes included **an expansion in our contributors**, including the onboarding of lazervike as product manager, a bigger dedication from acalanto on info organization and internal community management, extra time from phytann on updating the old bots to be more flexible and compatible with v2 and three new contributors, kingjhon, lucasVDD and gabobena on development and design.\n\nWith this expansion Canu has been running on it’s investor/donation funds for a while now until we actually had something functional that could justify bigger investment.\n\nAs it can be extremely beneficial for juiceboxDAO to have a free automated community launch kit and an accessible quick launch support from Canu team, the proposal is for Juicebox to participate in those costs for the next 3 months as part of the CanuDAO’s recurring payout.\n\nA list of the products that Canu has been focused in developing this last few months and that we want to keep moving forward on:\n\n\n- Canu Dao Helper v2: upgrading the heartbeat bot to be compatible to v2\n\n- Sentiment Analysis: a tool to run trough tweets that mention a certain tag, hash tag or pre-selection of posts to understand general opinion and strong points inside of it to help guide communities\n\n- GovBot: making the current bot running on #📚-governance-discussion more flexible, a new version is already running in canu but still under development to be fully customizable by and for each communtiy that wants to use it\n\n- AutoGov: a governance launch interface, allowing new communities to create governances from scratch, guiding them trough the processes they have to do\n\n- MetaBot: a bot that guides you trough the installment of other bots into your server so you don't have to hunt them yourself or have someone experienced do it to you\n\n- StarterKit: a 2-3 weeks process where we deploy human resources to pump the begining of your community, asking the right questions and generating movement. It's still under improvement before being properly 100% ready, but comicsDAO is the latest example.\n\n## Risks\n\nCommunities are made by people and it’s creation does not resolve around a specific formula, not all communities will be able to benefit completely from our tools as they can deeply differ from one another\n\nThe human part of the Starter kit service is dependent on availability, and although Canu can prioritize JB projects, we can’t run 20 at the same time, so if demand is too big we will have to pick projects to support first and then have a waitlist.\n\nOur bots have needed updates when v2 launched to adapt then to the new system, similar things can happen again upon changes and stall the progress again.\n\n## Specification\n\nIncrease CanuDAO’s payout from $8000 to $12000\nMake it clearly findable on Juicebox materials that those resources are available\n\n## Rationale\n\nThe increase in payout is based on the growth of the crew to provide this service\nThe visibility of those materials should be easy to find, so more projects can benefit trough it.\n\n## Timeline\n\nPAST\n\nJan 2022-now: realization that community launch is not scalable if dependent on long term human resource and start of Starter Kit development\n\nApril 2022-now: testing and improvements on the starter kit\n\nFUTURE if approved:\n\nFC#24: Change in the payouts\n\nJune 2022: Making all bots available for self implementation\n\nJune 2022: Publishing guides on how to build minimum viable communities\n\nJune-August 2022: Offering community starter kit at discount price to new juicebox projects\n\n## Copyright Disclaimer\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n\n\n---\n[Discussion Thread](https://discord.com/channels/775859454780244028/873248745771372584/982411713305530378) | [IPFS](https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/Qme4bu6CTup7gU5Sq9yqsKZj8LXsPVHaVHTvTeG4djtwnu)",

By keeping the discount rate so high for so long, the DAO has done two things:\n\n- Reduced fee-resultant JBX issuance, and thereby\n\n- Reduced reserved JBX issuance for contributors\n\nAs the discount rate dips downwards, the relative utility of issuance to project creators and DAO contributors will increase. This vested interest will contribute towards aligning the incentives for the entire community.\n\n## Risks\n\nThis may reduce the possibility of a “JBX moon”, but in my opinion increases JBX’s long-term prospects by aligning the community.\n\n## Timeline\n\nWe ought to reassess by FC#30, but no worries if not :^)\n\nI think this number should tend towards zero for a while.\n\n## Copyright Disclaimer\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n\n\n---\n[Discussion Thread](https://discord.com/channels/775859454780244028/873248745771372584/982415661047349248) | [IPFS](https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmXcmWht7zW3HBvypT7FAPEXT6umG8iKpZbC2kWiijKY32)",

      "content": "\n \n```plain text\nTitle: Revoke Existing Payout Proposals After Seven Funding Cycles\nAuthor: filipv\nDate: 2022-05-31\n```\n\n## Thesis\n\nFormally introduce a sunset clause (end date) on existing payout proposals.\n\n## Abstract\n\nAlthough the DAO has encouraged payout recipients to re-submit every 90 days, this process has not been formalized. This proposal will revoke existing payouts 7 funding cycles (98 days) after their implementation. Moving forward, the DAO should ask proposal authors to add sunset clauses to their proposals.\n\n## Motivation\n\nFor a payout to be removed, a DAO member must submit a proposal. In practice, this often fails–bystander effect, social pressure, and the time commitment can get in the way. By encouraging sunset clauses, the DAO will reduce governance overhead and the potential for conflict.

Establishing the voting tokens as one of the most unique tokens in WEB3. Continuing to offer design, illustration, animation and education support across the ecosystem. We are looking to continue our efforts at the current payout amount.\n\n### Risks:\n\nThe risks are not respecting the ETH. Over-payment for a service someone else could do better for less. \n\n### **Payout recipient:**\n\n@wagmistudios\n\n### **Payout amount:**\n\n$10,000 = \n\n$4000 Sage {Art, Illustration, Design, UI, Bannyverse Co Designer, Implementation}\n\n$3000 Burtula {Animation, Pixel Banny Creator, Bannyverse Co Designer, Bannyverse Collateral}\n\n$2000 Mieos {Art Direction/Curation, Communications, Connect of dots, Pusher-man}\n\n$1000 NatashaPankina {Folder Wizard, Layer Auditor}\n\n### **How have you contributed to the DAO?**\n\n• Currently working on the visual design aspect of the locked JBX NFT project which will bring better incentives to governance and exposure to Juicebox \n\n• Created 36 emojis and over 70 stickers which gives life to the JB Discord\n\n• Created logo, iconic Banny and other Juicebox characters featured on the website\n\n• Creating high quality cultural assets for iconic moments in JB history and for yearly events.\n\n• Collaborated with Lexicon Devils to create a unique digital hangout/education center in Crypto Voxels for Juicebox\n\n• Educational videos to help explain the more technical features of JB\n\n• WAGMI is also currently working on the marketing collateral and assets for the big Morgensterns Ice Cream Event. \n\n• Helping with UI for Juicebox High \n\n• Working on JuiceBox NFT Martketplace with Tankbottoms. \n\n We are collaborating with Jango, Tankbottoms, NatashaPankina, Viraz, Mr. Goldstein and others to create a Locked JBX voting NFT that will be beautifully unique in all of web3. Creating not just a voting token but also a Key to an infinite BannyVerse.\n\n### How do you want to contribute to the DAO going forward**?**\n\n• With TankBottoms and NatashaPankina help Wagmi plans to have all the assets ready for the switch to VeJBX voting. We are currently working on the visual assets and a UI that that will make this complex experience feel simple.  (Visuals for the NFT, and UI for website) \n\n• With TankBottoms and NatashaPankina help Wagmi plans to Build out a second minting experience where VeJBX holders can personalize their Banny - Secondary Banny sales will be split with JB DAO & Tank/Natasha (details TBD)and WAGMI\n\n• Continue to experiment using Art, Design, and Animation to expand the cultural reach of Juicebox and Banny. \n\n• Bring the heat to V2. Making sure people understand the value and are exited to jump in! Continue to create education tutorials and animations & infographics to help onboard and explain new features for V2\n\n• Continue to add value to other projects around the ecosystem though support, education, and unique high quality cultural assets. We will constantly strive to bring community support from every angle including 1 on 1 to make sure every JB project has every tool and understanding they need to succeed! \n\n### **What does success look like for someone taking on your role?**\n\n•  We what to help usher in the end of the era of “corporate” art. We want revenue generating machines that have serious products, services, and contributors to be able to flex their own style in the world. Adding to the beauty and the distribution of iconic art in the world. Doing this though a delicate, graceful balance of edginess, playfulness and signaling trust though competency. \n\n •  We want the Juicebox ecosystem to thrive in a thousand ways, partially because their fundraising platform is as memorable and effective as Patreon, Kickstarter, and Onlyfans.  \n\n•  JBDAO and Discord becomes iconic and completely unique in web3 for its vibes, education, and exposure techniques.\n\n• When onboarding no longer includes questions about token mechanics.\n\n### **Under what criteria should the community reassess this payout?**\n\n• When a week goes by and you don't experience see WAGMI making moves!  \n\n### **Sponsors:**\n\n_List community members who agree to act as spokespeople for this proposal._\n\n\n---\n[Discussion Thread](https://discord.com/channels/775859454780244028/873248745771372584/982397249512415232) | [IPFS](https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmTjZfeERuiow395E9Wpi7SCkLJDNgKRb1AFAY7eQnyJh8)",

This came trough as an experiment in the ongoing discussion about guerilla marketing and juicebox presence in conferences. \n\nThis proposals aims to reimburse both contributors for the costs of accommodations, entrance to the conferences and transport, for a total of €2188.94, or $2348,82 or 1.34 ETH at the time of the writting.\n\n## Abstract:\n\n- Cover the costs for @johnnyD and [Zeugh](https://www.notion.so/d2e9734ddbfd432ea06098c264690162) to attend NFT Berlin - [https://nftberlin.org/](https://nftberlin.org/)(in Berlin, Germany) and Blocksplit - [https://blocksplit.net/](https://blocksplit.net/) (in Split, Croatia).\n\nThose costs include transportation, accommodations and tickets.\n\n- Cover the costs for marketing initiatives, like sticker production, juice-box distribution and gear necessary for our impact to work well\n\n- The total costs, described below in specification sum up to a total of: 1.34 ETH, split as 0.91 ETH for Zeugh and .43 for JohnnyD.\n\n##  Motivation:\n\nSpreading juicebox protocol visibility and utility to new ecosystem of users, focusing on builders.\n\nLearn the best practices to start a public relations cohort and support juicebox growth\n\nLearning more of how project creators that don’t use juicebox are doing for management of their own treasuries\n\nUnderstanding how different local ecosystems are building and how can we be a part of that in a way that benefits both JB and those communities\n\n## Risks:\n\nMost of the bridges we’ve set are still ongoing discussion, so we can’t clearly specify results yet. Projects onboard, new contributors help and adaptation to strategies will take some more time to get established from this experience\n\n## Specification:\n\nThe complete specification of costs, including receipts, can be found at the IPFS file: [https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/Qma7foTjXgCNuGLV681a4jhSYyQw4y4twx29N4pCJBXoCQ](https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/Qma7foTjXgCNuGLV681a4jhSYyQw4y4twx29N4pCJBXoCQ)\n\nIn summary: \nreimburse zeugh.eth for 0.91 ETH and the juicebox project [**johnnydao**](https://juicebox.money/#/p/johnnydao) **for .43ETH**\n\n### Zeugh: €1486,34\n\nTickets: €349\n\n\tNFT Berlin Ticket for Zeugh\n\nTransport: €424.36\n\n\tFlights from Lisbon to Split and from Split to Berlin\n\nAccommodations: €712.98\n\n\tHotels for both Zeugh and JohnnyD, for a total of 6 days, single bedroom twin beds.\n\n### JohnnyD: €702.50\n\nTickets: €549\n\n\tTicket for JohnnyD in NFT berlin and two tickets for blocksplit, for Johnny and Zeugh\n\nTransport: €153.50\n\n\tTrain from prague to split and flight from split to berlin\n\nAccommodations: €0\n\n## Rationale:\n\nIn the last few weeks Zeugh and JohnnyD have been to two conferences in behalf of juiceboxDAO, focused on presenting juicebox to new project creators, meeting possible new partnerships and doing field research with users to understand best use cases and needs.\n\nThe first one was Blockslplit in croatia, from which results in possible partnerships and new projects were created in the areas of marketing, legal and music NFTs.\n\nThe second was NFT Berlin, where we established contacts with local NFT creator groups, metaverse-to-real-life-to-metaverse streaming, DeSci communities and NFT project creators.\n\nIn both places there were also relevant insights in product fit and evolution, as well as how to best perform irl marketing in such events. \n\n## Timeline:\n\n- 23-25 Blocksplit \n\n- 25-27 NFT berlin\n\n- FC#24: reimbursement to each of them\n\n## Copyright Disclaimer:\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n\n\n---\n[Discussion Thread](https://discord.com/channels/775859454780244028/873248745771372584/982272466787381288) | [IPFS](https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmcDHVa5sPxE9o8VqcbY65Eyywxe6BxNJdCq2FR2ga3yiN)",

This comprises $1000 of retroactive compensation and $4000 of compensation for the period of FC24.\n\nBy voting to approve this proposal in Snapshot, you are confirming that you have read and agree to the [Terms of Engagement](https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmYpYs1uvRQ9thKsk8PVEekSzka6HtZ24SRVx2fzAgc94T) with _dao dev inc.,_ Nicholas’s employer.\n\n_Terms of Engagement IPFS CID: QmYpYs1uvRQ9thKsk8PVEekSzka6HtZ24SRVx2fzAgc94T_\n\n## Rationale:\n\nJuicebox is close to my heart. I was a contributor from July 2021 to February 2022, when I decided to take some time away. In the intervening months it has become clear that Juicebox is the project I’m most excited and passionate about, and one that I very much want to help succeed and reach its full potential. \n\nI have a pertinent set of skills, context, and network to help Juicebox in the following areas: \n\n1- NFT product development: design, integration, and market research\n\n2- Product development: strategy, prioritization, and JB development coordination, design\n\n3- Internal communications: town halls, documentation\n\n4- External communications: communicating about projects being built on the protocol, v2 dev buidl opportunities, JBDAO governance engagement, Juicecast podcast (if desired)\n\n5- Solidity development: test writing, extension development, future nft development, integration with relevant peers\n\n6- Partnerships and recruiting: creating and stewarding relationships with peers such as Buidl Guidl (Austin Griffith), Gitcoin (Scott Moore), and others, helping to recruit talent to JBDAO and as 3rd parties to build atop the protocol \n\n7- Compliance: legal strategy, planning, and relationships with counsel\n\nIf my contributions are useful and valued by the DAO, I will make another subsequent proposal for either a second trial, or a recurring payout.\n\n## Timeline:\n\n1 FC duration, FC#24\n\n## Copyright Disclaimer:\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n\n\n---\n[Discussion Thread](https://discord.com/channels/775859454780244028/873248745771372584/979810301971136582) | [IPFS](https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmNYaW38ckkmcVva2ptFk88B9bXhCJnnYfwb8vxBHFy4Xa)",

      "content": "\n \n```plain text\nTitle: Treasury Management Launch\nAuthor: Mr. Goldstein & VJ\nDate: 5/8/2022\n```\n\n## Thesis:\n\nBy utilizing part of its $11M treasury, the JuiceboxDAO will be able to generate yield and increase the longevity of the DAO as well as fund ecosystem growth \n\n## Abstract:\n\nThe JuiceboxDAO currently holds $11M of ETH on its balance sheet that is not productive. These funds can be generating yield to further ensure the longevity of the JuiceboxDAO and fund ecosystem growth. We propose launching Juicebox Treasury Management in three phases each divided into a separate proposal as follows:\n\n- Phase 1 - Establish a Treasury Management Committee, Initial Staking Allocation, Initial Ecosystem Experiment\n\n- Phase 2 - Develop Robust Juicebox Grant / Ecosystem Program\n\n- Phase 3 -  Create a stablecoin allocation\n\n**Through this proposal we ask the community to approve:**\n\n- **Establishing a Treasury Management Committee & electing members to move this area forward in the DAO**  \n\n- **Initial allocation of ETH for stETH which will be allocated within 2 months and pending technical development**\n\n## Motivation:\n\nUtilizing the treasury will allow us to:\n\n- Ensure the longevity of the JuiceboxDAO through market cycles\n\n- Cover costs and grow asset base\n\n- Supports and grows our ecosystem by investing in promising projects\n\n- Strategic partnerships and investments in DAO tooling infrastructure protocols\n\n- Diversify our asset base\n\n- Demonstrate JBX leadership in DAO treasury management. Can eventually productize for projects on our platform\n\n## Operational Specification:\n\nWe propose to establish a Treasury Management Committee. The Committee will be responsible for proposing policies to achieve Juicebox’s strategic treasury objectives. The Committee will closely collaborate to adjust capital deployment targets / methods and will have a quarterly community meeting to review allocated capital. \n\nAdditionally, the committee will maintain a monthly reporting cadence providing the DAO with visibility into Treasury Management performance and risks. \n\n**Initially, we propose the Committee to include the following 5 members: VJ, Mr. Goldstein, Filipv, Tankbottoms, Jango**\n\nIt’s important to note that the committee will be operating as an advisory capacity only for the DAO, and will not be able to control direct capital allocations. Once a proposal by the committee was accepted the JuiceboxDAO multisig will be executing the funds allocation.\n\nNote on Treasury Redemptions \n\n- Using V2, the Juicebox Treasury will be able to account for stETH for the purposes of bonding curve redemptions \n\n- In case the ETH redemptions from the JuiceboxDAO Treasury accede the ETH available, redeemers will be able to receive stETH   \n\nExecution of all Treasury Management activities will commence with the following sequence:\n\n- Staked ETH - upon proposal approval with manual portion starting first; full deployment is pending technical implementation (1 - 2 months)\n\n- Creation of Treasury Management Committee - upon proposal approval \n\n- Ecosystem Fund & Strategic Investments - upon separate proposal approval\n\n- USDC - upon separate proposal approval\n\n## Initial Capital Allocation Specification:\n\nThe committee will be following an endowment capital allocation methodology, focusing on capital preservation vs. yield. On following is representative of endowment sample allocations:\n\n![](https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/e292a885-eac4-4ceb-8901-591b20cbd410/Untitled.png?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Content-Sha256=UNSIGNED-PAYLOAD&X-Amz-Credential=AKIAT73L2G45EIPT3X45%2F20220524%2Fus-west-2%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20220524T000111Z&X-Amz-Expires=3600&X-Amz-Signature=bf7c45d3a0e34e07b51d4281c0472b2ac8d796f09fcb65b1176f89dbc403ab7f&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&x-id=GetObject)\n\nFor JuiceboxDAO to follow a similar capital allocation structure, we recommend the following allocations:\n\nAt launch, the Treasury Management Committee proposes the three following allocations as part of the overall strategy:\n\n- **ETH liquid staking - 75% of total ETH balance or 56.2% of total treasury** \n\n\t- Lido (30%): staked ETH generates 3.7% (post merge will be high single - low double digits by end of the year). Initially to be implemented manually\n\n\t- Rocketpool / Lido / Stakewise (70%): staked ETH generates 4.03%. While Lido is the leading player with $10B of ETH staked, adding other providers such as Rocketpool / Stakewise can reduce protocol risk while maintaining liquidity\n\n\t- stETH, rETH, and sETH have significant liquidity with ETH \n\n- **Ecosystem Grant / Fund - $100K [separate proposal to follow]**\n\n\t- Initial allocation of $100K to seed projects on Juicebox \n\n\t- Over time, launch formal grants / ecosystem fund with application process and committee review\n\n- **Stablecoin yield- 50% of USDC balance or 9% of total treasury [separate proposal to follow]**\n\n\t- Over the next 6 months, we will be looking to sell ETH for USDC programmatically to achieve 2 years of runway and generate yield on half of the balance \n\n**Overall, between ETH staking (post merge) and stablecoin yield, we believe we can generate $750-1M of yield which would cover half to 2/3 of our annual opex of $1.5M**\n\n## Risks:\n\n- Smart contract failure risk\n\n\t- Mitigant: All protocols needs to be audited and are supported by a strong investor base\n\n- Working capital management / liquidity risk\n\n\t- Mitigant: JBX can cover operating expenses with revenue. 2 year runway with USDC. Also 80%+ of treasury is liquid\n\n- Operational security\n\n\t- Mitigant: Control remains with the multi-sig\n\n## Timeline:\n\nThe treasury has an infinite time horizon and exists to serves the JBX ecosystem in perpetuity.\n\n## Copyright Disclaimer:\n\n_All proposals must be in the public domain._\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n\n\n---\n[Discussion Thread](https://discord.com/channels/775859454780244028/873248745771372584/972948378872856668) | [IPFS](https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmVdNY4Rbrv1YoEEAzR8ZKKwUcG3amxHVPpPQ61c2Y59Rp)",

This is a great way to create opportunities for not just web3 builders to delve into the world of JB, but also to introduce normies of NYC to the good that can come out of decentralized funding through free ice cream, inflatable banny’s, builder sessions, and good vibes. This will also be a great opportunity to meet and thank the people who have already created projects using the protocol and strengthen camaraderie across projects. Add to get Filipv, Tankbottoms, Nicholas, and Mieos dancing in the streets of NYC in life size banana costumes. \n\nMorgenstern’s is an iconic, NYC brand centrally located, in a landmark area between Greenwich Village and lower Manhattan, so partnering with them to spread the good word of JB is pretty special. They’ve worked with the Rick  & Morty brand, Flavors of Singapore, and word on the street is that Coinbase has a contract in to have them at their events at NFT NYC as well. There’s no doubt, this is an epic paring. \n\nWe’ll have access to a reserved, special events space and have access to space in the street to set up extra tables/ chairs for people to hangout, catch up, learn, create, whatever the ice cream inspires them to do.  We’ll be able to host people who are interested in learning how the protocols works and give. them the opportunity to build their project right then and there with a seasoned JB member helping them along the way. \n\nThe MNYC team will have window and door decals printed which will serve as advertising for the ice cream pop up prior to the event itself to help get the word out. JB will have a dedicated ice cream cart and staff scoopin’ for the DOA between the hours of 12p-6p June 20-23rd.  \n\nPrior to the event (ASAP), Members of JB DAO will submit ice cream names and flavors which will then be voted on by the DAO. The top 6 will become the flavors that are served over the four days with the possibility of the flavors becoming a capsule collection for JB Protocol and used for future events/ endeavors.  \n\n<u>Budget breakdown</u> \n\n$15k for creation of product, use of staff at MNYC over the four day, 6 hrs/ day, including tip for staff, as well as vinyl window and door decals that will be up a few days prior to our event taking place as well as the ice cream cart branding and signage for the street if we decide to “wrap” the street space with branding. With guidance from Nick, the owner, this budget allows for our target of giving away 420 scoops of ice cream per day.  \n\n$12K for SWAG and decor- @Sage Pivirotto is creating a unique design for tshirts that will showcase the JB x Morgenstern’s Collab event. @0xSTVG is on board to print tshirts, bandanas, and stickers via merch squad.  Nick, the owner of Morgenstern’s has a connection for hats & visors.  The idea is to turn the space we have access to, into a IRL mini version of the JB learning center with tropical vibes.  Lexicon Devils are up to creating a  CV replica of Morgenstern’s so we can live stream some build sessions or so people who aren’t able to make it to NYC can pop in and say ‘waz up”. We’re pricing out inflatable JB costumes and logos, a toucan may or may not make an appearance one day, and other, small give ways are in the works should budget allow.  \n\n$3k on hand for unforeseen events that will need to be addressed immediately. Kenbot will be our “boots on the ground” contact for this event so would be the one overseeing potential need for last minute spending. \n\n$1k for Kenbot’s event management during the four days. \n\nTotal: $31,000 USD (MNYC will accept ETH as payment)\n\nShould there be a remaining balance, it will be returned to the treasury. \n\nCheck out full discord convo here: [https://discord.com/channels/775859454780244028/880292990474649680/976262959217115176](https://discord.com/channels/775859454780244028/880292990474649680/976262959217115176)\n\nAnd Event Planning, notion workspace, here:\n\n[https://www.notion.so/juicebox/Event-planing-for-JB-x-Morgenstern-s-NYC-5f1f4707c4b348baa71654c6e8823d2a](https://www.notion.so/juicebox/Event-planing-for-JB-x-Morgenstern-s-NYC-5f1f4707c4b348baa71654c6e8823d2a)\n\n## Risks:\n\nTimeline is tight, so we can’t drop a ball when it comes to design and merch creation. We have to make sure there is enough time to produce and get items shipped in time. Same for ice cream flavors, MNYC needs at least one week to get our flavors made. \n\nNot enough people come for free ice cream so we’re stuck having to eat it all ourselves. \n\n## Timeline:\n\nDetailed out in body of proposal. \n\n## Copyright Disclaimer:\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n\n\n---\n[Discussion Thread](https://discord.com/channels/775859454780244028/873248745771372584/976496409375309955) | [IPFS](https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmbYkxZbuCvwRzQZtJYWru5zfHVhybYFRcEKsdP62VD6jw)",

      "title": "JBP-181 - Revisit the JBX redemption rate",
      "content": "\n```plain text\nTitle: Revisit the JBX redemption rate\nAuthor: mieos and zhape\nDate: 05/19/2022\n```\n\n\n## Thesis: \n\nTo revisit the redemption rate of JuiceboxDAO treasury, change it to 80%\n\n## Abstract:\n\nWe had a proposal ([https://www.notion.so/juicebox/Increase-JBX-Bonding-Curve-to-95-039166a8ae844951a233c90ce0cda107](https://www.notion.so/juicebox/Increase-JBX-Bonding-Curve-to-95-039166a8ae844951a233c90ce0cda107)) to increase the JBX redemption rate (aka bonding curve rate) to the current level of 95% in Feb. 2022. As the community keeps evolving and macro market condition changed drastically, we think it’s high time we come back and try to find a new balance to this mechanism.\n\n## Motivation:\n\nThe last proposal to increase the redemption rate to 95% has fully accomplished what we expected it to function properly in the past several months. But as the condition has changed and needs to have such a high percentage no longer seems as demanding, we think it should be put into discussion again if such a percentage still aligns with the overall interest of our community.\n\n## Risks:\n\n- Lower redemption rate, esp. in the current market situation, might loosen the floor price of JBX in the AMM market, in turn induce the loss of faith by community members, and lower community involvement might follow, for an interval of time not known if the current market situation persists.\n\n- During the time between proposal discussion and final voting, this proposal might create big pressure on redemption by holders, for fear that they might have less redemption value.\n\n## Specification:\n\nDecrease the JBX redemption rate to 80% from the upcoming Funding cycle.\n\n## Rationale:\n\n- From the #16FC till today, the total redemption of JBX amounts to around 324m, roughly 14.7% of the total supply, and about 750 ETH in terms of treasury assets.  Although we have one big redemption by certain early contributor and another one by the assangeDAO, which add up to about 142m, we still have 182m gets burned from other holders. This should have played its part in the objectives of the last proposal, i.e. stakeholder alignment, increasing flexibility, strengthening the JBX ecosystem.\n\n- We noticed that there have been several suspicious bots active in arbitraging the difference between our redemption rate and AMM market price. Although it helps to solidify the floor price of AMM market, it doesn’t align with our long-term interest. It looks as if we are intervening with the secondary market price through these arbitraging bots. If the community is interested in managing the market price of JBX, we always have better options to do it.\n\n- In the current market situation, the overall price level fluctuates very drastically on a daily basis. Although JBX stays pretty resilient, it still tends to be influenced by other major cryptocurrency esp. ETH,  and also sometimes falls prey to a gloomy mood in the bear market and gets dumped. A wide fluctuation in price will mean more arbitrage opportunities. Arbitrageurs tend to buy JBX on the secondary market and redeem them for ETH in our treasury. This create unnecessary loss of treasury asset. \n\n- We have a bottom line that we want to adapt to difficult market conditions - being successful in a bear market relying mostly on the ability to survive and buidl. \n\n## Timeline:\n\neffective in the upcoming Funding cylce.\n\n## Copyright Disclaimer:\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n\n\n---\n[Discussion Thread](https://discord.com/channels/775859454780244028/873248745771372584/977339859368804374) | [IPFS](https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/Qmcty8tbDe9wXidX3TRWYvjV8w3XEH6f5T3MuxRL5wVXZS)",

      "content": "\n \n```plain text\nTitle: DAO NYC Sponsorship\nAuthor: Dennison Bertram (dennison@tally.xyz)\nDate: May 19th, 2022\n```\n\n## Thesis:\n\nDAO NYC will be the flagship DAO Event in New York, a conference for DAO’s by DAO’s to talk and learn...about DAO’s. \n\nThis proposal is to request that JuiceBox DAO to attend and sponsor the event.  The sponsorship amount would be 10K, but would have the speaking/panel benefit of the Contributor Tier.\n\nThe payment address would be: 0x7E90E03654732ABedF89Faf87f05BcD03ACEeFdC\n\nThis should correspond to: **tallyxyz.eth**\n\n\n[bookmark](https://bit.ly/DAONYC)\n\n## Abstract:\n\nDAO NYC is looking to gather 35 DAO’s, DAO Tools, Service Providers, and builders into a one day conference in New York where we can learn, build and grow from one another. \n\nSet during the week of NFT NYC, and right before ETHNY, DAO NYC is an un-conference format event focused on interactive panel discussions and workshops. The topics range from creating, building and running DAO’s, community challenges and solutions, treasury management, organization best practices and more. \n\nThe conference is very much a product of the sponsors who participate and we are looking forward to a very hands on, rewarding event.\n\n## Motivation:\n\nI personally (Dennison Bertram, co-founder of Tally.xyz) would like JuiceBox DAO to be a sponsor of the event. JuiceBox is paving the way for what collective crowdfunding looks like, what it can do, and how we can use it to create+fund wild ideas and sustainable communities. \n\nAs the authority on DAO crowdfunding I think JuiceBoxes voice is important to have as part of the discussion. \n\n## Risks:\n\nWe could put on a bad conference or no one comes. \n\n## Specification:\n\nDAO NYC is requesting a sponsorship of Contributor Tier ($10k) the breakdown is as follows: \n\n\nContributor: \n1 of 12 NFT series dedicated to event sponsorship\n\n3rd tier logo placement in marketing materials and event page\n\nOwn (1) speaking opportunity\nFeature of company/brand in marketing materials \n5 NFT tickets for team and partners\nBasic on-site branded experience\nGit Bag inclusion\nLogo on commemorative t-shirt back\n\nIn either case, we would be happy to work with JuiceBox to determine the best way to appear at the event. \n\n## Rationale:\n\nDAO NYC is a community event and needs the community of DAO’s to help support it. \n\n## Timeline:\n\nThe event is June 22nd, but of course the event costs close far far in advance. Ideally we would ask to receive the sponsorship payment in the next two weeks at the latest. \n\n## Copyright Disclaimer:\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n\n\n---\n[Discussion Thread](https://discord.com/channels/775859454780244028/873248745771372584/977339944148279406) | [IPFS](https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmewjHEc19H4ahNvaHapQCNo39M9THykEuuQevygdbeGNT)",

While I do believe my unique set of skills are still very relevant and needed when it comes to human connection, I believe the aspect of my previous role, specific to task management, is no longer a necessity of the dao. As “teams” meld around specific events or even sub doa’s their own ways of holding each other accountable form.  \n\nAlthough task mgmt has dwindled, other ways I’ve grown have been in the realms of human resources, interpersonal relationships, and most recently- event planning.  Along with kenbot, we pulled together (should the [proposal pass](/5f4c34d7a7a74fa7bd6d0d22957e79af)) one of the most unique events JB DOA will have hosted/ sponsored to date, and it’s only the beginning!\n\n I believe we have a unique opportunity to bring Juicebox to the people. We should explore further collaborations with other restaurants, apparel brands, etc looking to enter the web3 world as well as launch other builders projects via hosting “hack and chats”. What if we onboard ideas in a space that is itself an irl business that wants to be onboarded. There are a growing number of irl businesses that want to use web3 to explore new customer relations concepts and what better way than to do so using Juicebox protocol? \n\nI still plan to assist in onboarding new members and people introducing and vetting new tooling, helping answer/ direct people to the right places when other mods are AFK.  However, until the spinning up of consistent events and workshops happens, I think my payout should be reduced.\n\n## Timeline:\n\nTo take effect in FC 24 and has a sunset clause of six funding cycles. \n\n## Copyright Disclaimer:\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n\n\n---\n[Discussion Thread](https://discord.com/channels/775859454780244028/873248745771372584/977031399532027945) | [IPFS](https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmewLM1rDMA8UgKjeuUceLa2p2WF2fRArBQ3qJunXD5JHC)",

      "content": "\n```plain text\nTitle: Reduce recurring payouts\nAuthor: aeolian\nDate: 2022-05-20\n```\n\n\n## Thesis:\n\nReduce all recurring payouts by 20%.\n\n## Abstract:\n\nIncrease runway of Juicebox DAO by 10 months by reducing the payout amount for all recurring payout recipients (individuals and groups) by 20%. Trial payouts are excluded from the reduction.\n\n## Motivation:\n\nDue to increasing expenses, low revenue, market conditions and JBX redemptions of treasury funds, Juicebox DAO’s runway has dramatically decreased. On April 29, 2022, Juicebox DAO’s runway was[ 50 months](https://twitter.com/twodam_eth/status/1519718266905657344). As of May 20, 2022 (3 weeks later), it is approximately [31 months](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19zo6xp06VZRyZ8eJpGkU3fHcFibYYTIF-HDxioGRIos/edit?usp=sharing). This is a very conservative figure; it doesn’t include one-time payouts or trial payouts. By some estimates, our runway may be closer to [22 months](https://dune.com/queries/492370/933393).\n\nAs JBX holders, we have a responsibility to ourselves, Juicebox DAO contributors, and all Juicebox projects to be disciplined with our spending and maximize longevity of the Juicebox protocol. We need to give ourselves the best chance of finding product-market-fit and reliable revenue. To do that, we need more time.\n\n## Risks:\n\n- Contributors are less incentivized to provide value to Juicebox DAO.\n\n- Contributors leave Juicebox DAO.\n\n## Specification:\n\n- Update the payout list to match Table 1.\n\n- Any active proposals in this governance cycle that modify any existing payout/s may overrule this proposal.\n\n**Table 1**\n\nRecipient|Amount|Address/Juicebox Project\n---|---|---\nPeel| $ 36,800.00 |@peel\nJango| $ 16,800.00 |jango.eth\nGorilla| $ 14,800.00 |drgorilla.eth\nTankbottoms| $ 12,800.00 |tankbottoms.eth\nGivewell| $ 8,000.00|0x7cF2eBb5Ca55A8bd671A020F8BDbAF07f60F26C1\nwagmi| $ 7,360.00 |@wagmistudios\nfilipv| $ 6,400.00 |filipv.eth\ncanudao| $ 6,400.00 |@canudaocomm\nlexicondevils| $ 5,280.00 |@lexicondevils\n0xstvg| $ 4,000.00 |0xstvg.eth\ntwodam| $ 3,600.00 |twodam.eth\nviraz| $ 2,400.00 |viraz.eth\nzombae| $ 2,400.00 |zom-bae.eth\nFelixander| $ 1,600.00 |0xA8488938161c9Afa127E93Fef6d3447051588664\ngulan| $ 1,600.00 |gulan.eth\nzhape|$1,200.00|zhape.eth\nzotico| $ 640.00 |0x6212ce06Dcac01706e6Be5310C3228ede1A02ADf\n\n## Rationale:\n\n- A 20% reduction extends our runway by ~8 months. While somewhat arbitrary, this feels like a reasonable compromise.\n\n- Juicebox contributors are generally highly-paid, often above market rate. This mostly remains true even after a 20% reduction.\n\nPlease inspect this spreadsheet for full cashflow projections: [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19zo6xp06VZRyZ8eJpGkU3fHcFibYYTIF-HDxioGRIos/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19zo6xp06VZRyZ8eJpGkU3fHcFibYYTIF-HDxioGRIos/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n## Timeline:\n\nThe new payout schedule would take affect immediately in FC#23.\n\n## Copyright Disclaimer:\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n\n\n---\n[Discussion Thread](https://discord.com/channels/775859454780244028/873248745771372584/977191967647731712) | [IPFS](https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmQjuipQ97s3LRTcoGyreb5NaEuFQe9v4Tavtg6bZeCEtR)",

We should be massively proud of this. \n\n## Motivation:\n\nDue to new market conditions, our runway has since shortened massively from the original proposal made in FC17 ([https://snapshot.org/#/jbdao.eth/proposal/0x31e639a097f96c8e727b213e6a429a5fe7131b90aabc87626f44da2197acd03a](https://snapshot.org/#/jbdao.eth/proposal/0x31e639a097f96c8e727b213e6a429a5fe7131b90aabc87626f44da2197acd03a)). To increase the probability of Juicebox’s long-term success and, therefore, the amount of good we can do in the future, we need to become as lean as possible in the present.

Myself feeling like this was a bit too high in combination with [this proposal ](/4a05ab6e9afe49f899c72b3604f040ea)I decided to drop it to $8,000.\n\n## Timeline:\n\nEnter Recurring Payouts starting at FC 23.\n\n## Copyright Disclaimer:\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n\n\n---\n[Discussion Thread](https://discord.com/channels/775859454780244028/873248745771372584/977359920418652181) | [IPFS](https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmNTJrcHvithP8khMGR7DNnU1QzFqZiX2BensnfeAfnzrd)",

Matthew and Brileigh will co-host and handle all production related tasks.\n\n## Motivation:\n\nWe have been regularly attending town halls since March and it is clear that we want to become dedicated contributors at Juicebox **🧃**\n\nWe have produced two episodes of the Juicecast so far and would love to continue making more. This second trial period will let us reflect on the content of the first two episodes and continue dedicating time to pre-production, hosting, and post-production in order to make the podcast consistent and high-quality.\n\nOur goal with this podcast is to create a cultural anthropology of Juicebox through interviews with community members building and maintaining projects using the protocol. We’ll be talking to a wide range of builders within the JB ecosystem to show the range of projects that Juicebox enables.\n\nHere are the two episodes that we have produced so far:\n\n🦈 An interview with dropnerd from SharkDAO\n\n🕵️‍♂️ A deep-dive into the Juicebox sleuths at Moody’s DAO\n\nAnd here are some examples of episodes that we have planned:\n\n🍊 Talking all things v2, frontend, and more with Aeolian from Peel DAO\n\n📜 A retrospective episode on Constitution DAO\n\n🚀 The crypto space race with Moon DAO \n\n🏗 Lexicon Devils and metaverse architecture\n\n🏘️ Exploring DAO governance to run a town IRL with Sätra Brunn\n\ntldr; we love JB and want to spend more time here **💕**\n\n## Risks:\n\n- Both [matthewbrooks.eth](https://www.notion.so/f2e36c73f12a4fddaceb4bcb35c6c9ff) and [brileigh.eth](https://www.notion.so/082e9b5acc1c457d9f379f8815505e1c) are new contributors to Juicebox\n\n- Respecting the production timeline in order to release bi-weekly episodes\n\n- As a coven, Brileigh _does_ have the ability to cast spells... even curses... 🪄\n\n## Specification:\n\n$1000 trial payout for [Untitled](https://www.notion.so/d721e35e3fb046b7987e1b3b2e5af1a0) and [Untitled](https://www.notion.so/778ab2fa34394dfeba63f91e695b8fa9) to matthewbrooks.eth ($2000 total)\n\n$1000 trial payout for [Untitled](https://www.notion.so/d721e35e3fb046b7987e1b3b2e5af1a0) and [Untitled](https://www.notion.so/778ab2fa34394dfeba63f91e695b8fa9) to brileigh.eth ($2000 total)\n\n## Rationale:\n\nThe previous production budget paid was [$1500 per funding cycle](/aa2f92f5ffc545e28fd7bff6964ca33d) and this proposal reflects the added preparation needed as co-hosts.\n\n## Timeline:\n\nWe have released two episodes during our first trial period which respected our goal of releasing an episode every two weeks. The podcast will continue to be produced on a bi-weekly basis i.e. one episode produced for [Untitled](https://www.notion.so/d721e35e3fb046b7987e1b3b2e5af1a0) and one for [Untitled](https://www.notion.so/778ab2fa34394dfeba63f91e695b8fa9). Pre-production and recording will take place during the first week of the funding cycle and post-production will be finished during the second week.\n\n## Copyright Disclaimer:\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n\n\n---\n[Discussion Thread](https://discord.com/channels/775859454780244028/873248745771372584/977282407172554812) | [IPFS](https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/Qmc6atA9yJZ7y9SZ3U16UyfMMgYehv8eB9EWRhMSto83LQ)",

      "content": "\n \n```plain text\nTitle: CanuDAO payout renewal\nAuthor: Zeugh\nDate: May 20th, 2022\n```\n\n## Thesis:\n\nCanu has been delivering it’s goals in community and development, and wants to extend it’s current payout of $8000/ cycle for one more cycle while it finishes internally discussing a new proposal.\n\n## Abstract:\n\nAs the payout period of CanuDAO for community management, research and development on tools and services for community ends, this is a proposal to renew it, exactly the same, but only for one more cycle instead of more 90 days.\n\n## Motivation:\n\nCanu is discussing relevant related topics inside it's own governance and the submission of a 90 day new proposal would probably cross it in ways that would be unhealthy for a better outcome. \n\n\nThe previous proposal, being renewed, can be seen here:\n[https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmSgA1UbasPGotwBZdZnJWKfECsoQHWu6spNUnoZoLscs3](https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmSgA1UbasPGotwBZdZnJWKfECsoQHWu6spNUnoZoLscs3)\n\nIn the following link you can find a short report of how the goals of this proposal have been delivered:\n[https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmYwviQadXj684qAUBt4C6dCAyBW827meg2AR1zq5LWAmd](https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmYwviQadXj684qAUBt4C6dCAyBW827meg2AR1zq5LWAmd)\n\n## Risks:\n\nCanuDAO doesn't finish it's proposals in time for next cycle and are left out of payroll\n\n## Specification:\n\nCanuDAO extends it’s $8000/cycle payout period for one more cycle for the work of research, management and development in the areas of Community, DAO tooling and growth.\n\n## Rationale:\n\nAs stated in the proposal for the ongoing payout, Canu's goals include improving it's structure to provide better service for new projects running in Juicebox and we were going trough a big internal reorganization moment. Those two things together have impacted Canu even further than I expected.\n\nIn the last 3 months we've been gradually having more of our resources directed towards research and development to create and improve more scalable tools and processes so we can better support the development of new communities. This was motivated mostly for realizing that the work delivered currently by Zeugh in Juicebox and by Gogo in Slice, like described in the older proposal, is not something we found a efficient manner to expand to more projects as it's a job of constant presence in the space and hard to replicate for multiples.\n\nIn this next phase of Canu's and Juicebox partnership the goal is to get more energy in this building area. As we face a possible bear market the idea of cutting costs is important, but bringing new value in is also essential, our goal in the near future is to be allocate more devs and informational organization so we can make those tools more accessible to those communities in an autonomous way, where Canu can be hired to provide a service if there’s availability and interest, but can also just supply the basics a community needs for free to the project, based on what it's been developing under juicebox's payout.\n\nWe also want to onboard into canu new people that have been spectacular in juicebox community and could really help us bring other communities to its best practices for good growth, visibility and vibe. That's why felixander, Casstoshi were invented into the Canu’s team and more talks with matthewbrooks and brileigh are underway, to learn how we can collaborate to take our good practices further for more communities.\n\nThe expectation in Canu right now is to have a raise payout proposal in next cycle, in order to provide better payouts for our devs and internal team and bring new people in so we can better expand our service for new Juicebox projects.\n\n## Timeline:\n\nThis cycle: extension of payout and closing of the discussions on Canu’s governance. \nNext cycle: new proposal from Canu to create a new payout for the next period.\n\n## Copyright Disclaimer:\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n\n\n---\n[Discussion Thread](https://discord.com/channels/775859454780244028/873248745771372584/977318833708732426) | [IPFS](https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmbumqVAMjKZTe128Mepb8b9iJZzaftPEKV14ESoXZrjqd)",

      "content": "\n \n_After a trial period of 1-3 cycles, contributors are encouraged to propose a recurring role for themselves. Recurring payouts should be renewed/updated every 90 days._\n\n### **Author:**\n\n[Zótico](https://www.notion.so/cc5811dad7fa4c139d630870f9b00ddb) \n\n### **Proposal date:**\n\nMay 17, 2022\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n**This proposal brings to the community vote an increase in the recurring payment amount paid to me,** [**Zótico**](https://www.notion.so/cc5811dad7fa4c139d630870f9b00ddb)**, for six funding cycles.**\n\n**The current payment is of $800/cycle, which would be increased to $2000/cycle**  due to the increase in the workload of managing the teams responsible for translations in many languages, as well as implementing changes in the translation process and efficiently communicating the translation demands to the multiple teams.\n\nAn increase in the payout value is fair if we take into account the expansion of the demands that the role has had since the start of the translation efforts. Since _I started creating the translation processes for Juicebox_ (in the following proposal:[ ](https://www.notion.so/Bring-Zotico-in-as-Translation-Organizer-6d7c84c0f9bc433ba361844fe4a19753)[Bring Zotico in as Translation Organizer](https://www.notion.so/6d7c84c0f9bc433ba361844fe4a19753) ) _and its implementation , as well as the  start of the organized translation effort_, the amount of languages being translated, and therefore teams being managed has increased quite a bit. We can see when I started receiving recurring payments and we propose the amounts to be paid to translators on these proposals:[ ](https://www.notion.so/Adding-Zotico-as-recurring-contributor-for-Organizing-Translations-d749a28ceda74259bd5a74d57239bdad)[Adding Zotico as recurring contributor for Organizing Translations](https://www.notion.so/d749a28ceda74259bd5a74d57239bdad) ,[ ](https://www.notion.so/Translation-Payment-specific-proposals-a699f31609ee452daa600c9b47124c29)[Translation Payment specific proposals](https://www.notion.so/a699f31609ee452daa600c9b47124c29) and [Continue to pay @Untitled for translation management](https://www.notion.so/1213ac1122c84873bd25f7da074767a1) . We have increased the number of languages approved for translation _from 5 to 13 languages_ ****and the number of translators of _12, for a team (that is still growing) which currently has 35 people_ (in the proposals[ ](https://www.notion.so/Redefinition-of-values-and-metrics-for-translation-team-942fbff1d15f4a71897a843893ccb538)[Redefinition of values and metrics for translation team](https://www.notion.so/942fbff1d15f4a71897a843893ccb538) and[ ](https://www.notion.so/Take-translations-tasks-management-and-payments-management-from-notion-and-tip-cc-to-dework-0c56d035806141f9aa03f77db4fe5eff)[Take translations tasks management and payments management from notion and tip.cc to dework](https://www.notion.so/0c56d035806141f9aa03f77db4fe5eff) ). Due to these changes, the amount of teams and languages that I have been managing has more than doubled, as well as changes of translation platforms and other processes that require my time and attention to work as efficiently as possible.\n\n### **Risks:**\n\nIf the management job is not correctly done, poorly done translations might be approved, making the Juicebox Interface and documents appear less professional and trustworthy.\n\nIf the management job is not correctly done, translators might not  be working as efficiently as possible due to not receiving enough content to work on, which can lead to delays on the translation teams.\n\nThe amount of management work being too much for only one person.\n\n### **Payout recipient:**\n\n0x6212ce06Dcac01706e6Be5310C3228ede1A02ADf\n\n### **Payout amount:**\n\n$2000\n\n### **How have you contributed to the DAO?**\n\n- Using Notion, I have created an autonomous and organized system for managing translation demands among translators where they can pick up tasks, let others know the status of this task and check how much they will be paid for the work done;\n\n- I created an introductory guideline so that translators know how to use the new system;\n\n- I created a system using Sheets to automatically calculate the amounts to be paid to translators in each cycle;\n\n- In the last 12 cycles, I requested the amounts to be paid to the translators and distributed the payments between them;\n\n- I was responsible for updating and maintaining translation demands in the translation system;\n\n- When we implemented Crowdin, I helped the translators to get used to using it and to update in Crowdin the translations that had already been finalized in the previous system;\n\n- I supported the translators by dealing with their doubts, answering questions and listening to their opinions in order to always improve our working conditions and maximize efficiency;\n\n- Worked together the DeWork team to migrate the system that I created to DeWork;\n\n- Dealing with new demands, including the expansion into more languages;\n\n- I created a system to check the quality of the work of new translators before they join the team;\n\n- I Searched for new translators to work in the new languages;\n\n- I created a tutorial so that translators could easily join DeWork;\n\n- Management of translators in general.\n\n### **How do you want to contribute to the DAO going forward**?****\n\n- Continue dealing with new demands, including the expansion into more languages;\n\n- Work on a system of rewards for translators, according to the work they have done;\n\n- Working on a system to better assess the quality of translations;\n\n- Continue to answer questions and manage the translators;\n\n- Improve the testing system for approving new translators;\n\n- Make payments to translators directly into your wallet, without going through[ tip.cc](http://tip.cc/);\n\n- Assist in adapting docs.juicebox documents for translation in DeWork;\n\n### **What does success look like for someone taking on your role?**\n\nHaving the translations finished with a high quality rate, keeping the translators motivated and payments on time, and constantly improving the processes related to the translator’s work.\n\n### **Under what criteria should the community reassess this payout?**\n\nIf for a prolonged period of time the translators in the community don’t get the appropriate support on my part or if I fail to execute the needed payments/management tasks.\n\n### **Sponsors:**\n\n[Zeugh](https://www.notion.so/d2e9734ddbfd432ea06098c264690162) \n\n\n---\n[Discussion Thread](https://discord.com/channels/775859454780244028/873248745771372584/976960559524216872) | [IPFS](https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmNjMBK2nKgC55Sj9NEot3m3Q5vJYvkuyXE2eWedoH6vb9)",

My proposal trial payout was approved in FC10 ([https://snapshot.org/#/jbdao.eth/proposal/0x108ce4086ecbe16641066b11d51055ccaa0898b177a896298a632c0749917b23](https://snapshot.org/#/jbdao.eth/proposal/0x108ce4086ecbe16641066b11d51055ccaa0898b177a896298a632c0749917b23)) and I have been very active in contribution to the community ever since. The reason why I didn’t apply for a recurring payout right after my trial, is that I was not super confident I was worth my price as I just came into the DAO. Now looking back to my days in JuiceboxDAO, I am confident and proud to say that I have done a decent job and will be able to do so in the future.\n\n## Motivation:\n\nI have been working as one of the contributors since I joined this community, now I hope I can be included into this team formally, and also my efforts can be compensated.\n\n## Risks:\n\nI might not be as responsible as I describe, or I might fail to deliver the job I am supposed to do.\n\n## Specification:\n\nAdd zhape.eth (0x5706d5aD7A68bf8692bD341234bE44ca7Bf2f654) to the JuiceboxDAO recurring payouts for USD1500 per funding cycle, and add him to the list of beneficiaries of reserved JBX. \n\n## Rationale:\n\nFor what I have done, please check my proposal for retroactive payout here: [https://www.notion.so/juicebox/Workspaces-1d90d66410c243f2ac9074d1545e23e3?p=5e5ad78838f44c15a2c4a8b5500fbad3](https://www.notion.so/juicebox/Workspaces-1d90d66410c243f2ac9074d1545e23e3?p=5e5ad78838f44c15a2c4a8b5500fbad3)\n\nThe job I am going to do for the JuiceboxDAO:\n\n- Keep on being a responsible mod in our Discord server. Help onboarding new members and encourage involvement and contribution of fellow members. \n\n- I will help to ensure the English-Chinese translations are of high quality as best as I can. (A few of our current translations are not very satisfying in terms of precision or readability). In the future, I will be more than happy to work as a quality control in this category.\n\n- I want to make myself the EN-CN interpreter and/or host in EN-CN bilingual meetings, or  in calls between Chinese speaking members and English ones when necessity arises, to try to help patch the language gap and smooth out communications within the community. No extra compensation should be asked for unless the number of this kind of meeting increases dramatically.\n\n- Assist in translating or drafting of proposals if needed by our CN members. \n\n- As the Town Hall every Wednesday is a window to get most up-to-date info and feel the vibe of our community, I want to compile the details of it every week and share with CN members. \n\n- Any other thing I will find in alignment with the interest of Juicebox ecosystem.\n\n## Timeline:\n\nEffective in the coming Funding cycle if this proposal is approved.\n\n## Copyright Disclaimer:\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n\n\n---\n[Discussion Thread](https://discord.com/channels/775859454780244028/873248745771372584/970122216022876232) | [IPFS](https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmW6VitN89T6as8iav1yVLDEBNu3k7obrDofexAPXiqZBb)",

      "content": "\n\n```plain text\nTitle: One time payout for zhape\nAuthor: zhape\nDate: 04/27/2022\n```\n\n## Thesis:\n\n To pay zhape.eth (0x5706d5aD7A68bf8692bD341234bE44ca7Bf2f654）a retroactive one-time payout to compensate his contribution from FC12 ~ FC21 (altogether 10FCs)for an amount of USD8000.\n\n## Abstract:\n\nzhape was approved his trial payout on FC10. Ever since then he has been working as mod and translator in the community very actively. This is to compensate what he has done for the DAO.\n\n## Motivation:\n\nHe hopes that his contribution in the past can be recognized by the community, a little bit more emotionally than financially.\n\n## Risks:\n\nRetroactive payout for such a long time can be a bad precedent.\n\n## Specification:\n\n Give zhape.eth (0x5706d5aD7A68bf8692bD341234bE44ca7Bf2f654）a one-time payout of USD8000 in the next funding cycle.\n\n## Rationale:\n\nHe has done a lot for this community and hopes to get the recognition from the community in return.\n\nWhat he has done so far:\n\n   1. Community communications: \n\n       1) Compiled and wrote a weekly summary about the activity for Chinese General Channel and submitted to the townhall for roughly eight weeks, with the help of @twodam,\n\n       2) Translated and compiled a summary of town hall meeting with the help of @Zom_bae, for roughly four weeks, and shared it in the Chinese General channel in Discord,\n\n       3) Acted as an interpreter on a bilingual meeting on Dec, 2021.\n\n       4) Translated some proposals for reference of CN member when there is no translation tasks put forward.\n\n   2. Community support:\n\n       1) Helped answering questions of other members and direct them to relevant channels or notion page when necessary,\n\n       2) Helped set up a CN governance channel and guided active members to discuss in dedicated channel about possible proposals and share opinions in this regard,\n\n       3) Worked together with @twodam to keep the order in relevant channels and try to soothe extreme emotions, which was typically hard work esp. between the end of 2021 and beginning of 2022. \n\n       4) Together with @twodam, he went through the finished translation tasks to find some low quality translation, revised a few and re-translated a few of them.\n\n   3. Alignment for Juicebox ecosystem:\n\n        He was one of the first to report suspicious activities in the projects on Juicebox protocol, e.g. the HeritageDAO ([https://discord.com/channels/775859454780244028/879851197857677372/936174023723876412](https://discord.com/channels/775859454780244028/879851197857677372/936174023723876412)) , which partly lead to the establishment of Moody’sDAO ([https://discord.com/channels/775859454780244028/876252266594721873/940469503836434473](https://discord.com/channels/775859454780244028/876252266594721873/940469503836434473))of which he is still an active contributor. He also filed some more reports about other projects, such as DAODenver, fake Juicebox on BSC, etc. before the Moody’sDAO was founded. The reports written for Moody’sDAO are not included here as contributions because Moody’sDAO might want to apply for support from JuiceboxDAO separately.\n\n## Timeline:\n\nEffective in the coming Funding cycle if this proposal is approved.\n\n## Copyright Disclaimer:\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n\n\n---\n[Discussion Thread](https://discord.com/channels/775859454780244028/873248745771372584/970118858306387998) | [IPFS](https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmQEg9Qmw6yvh48PUro7ZXGLvEysgYeW91PCbr4jS6KEXS)",

      "content": "\n \n```plain text\nTitle: One-time payout to dao-lawfirm.eth\nAuthor: filipv\nDate: 2022-05-05\n```\n\n## Thesis\n\nSend $40,000 USD worth of ETH to [dao-lawfirm.eth](https://dao-lawfirm.xyz/) in exchange for:\n\n- A terms of use for juicebox.money and similar frontends.\n\n- A privacy policy for juicebox.money and similar frontends.\n\n- Opinion letters for contributors with recurring payouts from Juicebox DAO, Peel DAO, WAGMI Studios, Canu DAO, or Lexicon Devils.\n\n## Motivation\n\nAddressing high priority legal concerns allows builders to keep building, but with legal clarity and peace of mind.\n\n- A terms of use and a privacy policy will obviously improve legal compliance, but will also serve as a valuable resource for new frontends to the Juicebox protocol and similar web3 projects. Project creators, communities, and anybody who interacts with the Juicebox protocol will likely benefit from this.\n\n- These opinion letters will provide legal guidance on how U.S. regulations apply to the DAO’s goals, on an individual level. These letters will explain what contributors should feel comfortable doing, and what should be avoided going forwards. They are also extremely valuable as official documentation that Juicebox contributors have sought out legal advice and done their proper diligence.\n\nThe immediate benefit to Juicebox DAO is obvious, but the Juicebox ecosystem may benefit even more. Juicebox DAO serves as a model throughout the Juicebox community, and as Juicebox DAO attains greater clarity, the ecosystem benefits in turn.\n\n## Risks\n\n- These deliverables cover some early priorities–they may not address all laws in all jurisdictions.\n\n- Opinion letters can only provide guidance. The final decision will always fall to individuals.\n\n- $40,000 is a serious commitment. What Juicebox is receiving in exchange is well worth the cost. Nevertheless, there is always risk of a failure to execute.\n\n- Contributors will have to reveal their identities and addresses to the law firm in order to receive opinion letters. Although nobody is being forced, this leaves some contributors with a difficult decision to make.\n\n## Specification\n\n- Multisig adds dao-lawfirm.eth to distribution at $20,000 worth of ETH for one funding cycle.\n\n- [dao-lawfirm](https://dao-lawfirm.xyz/) will construct a terms of use and a privacy policy.\n\n- Contributors interested in receiving an opinion letter should send an email to `info@dao-lawfirm.xyz` providing their legal name, address, and an overview of the work they do for Juicebox DAO.\n\n- dao-lawfirm will construct opinion letters for contributors.\n\n- Terms of use and privacy policy will be added to juicebox.money once ready.\n\n- Upon delivery of items listed above, multisig adds dao-lawfirm.eth to distribution at $20,000 worth of ETH for one more funding cycle.\n\n## Timeline\n\nThis process will likely take somewhere from 2 weeks to 2 months.\n\n## Copyright Disclaimer\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n\n\n---\n[Discussion Thread](https://discord.com/channels/775859454780244028/873248745771372584/972236659594784818) | [IPFS](https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/Qma9vTnxkuyncLjtYP3Lojhd5qf9ptEuwKNjXGACEWn7vV)",

I am now proposing to enter a trial period for one funding cycle with a payment of $3000.\n\n## Motivation:\n\nPast month I have spend 30-50(+?) hours a week working on various Juicebox smart contracts, here is some of the work I have done so far (ordered from biggest to smallest):\n\n- [Implemented the linear decreasing voting power for veBanny contract](https://github.com/jbx-protocol/jbx-staking/pull/16) (Still work-in-progress)\n\n- [Added EIP-165 support to Juicebox V2](https://github.com/jbx-protocol/juice-contracts-v2/pull/236) (including [tests](https://github.com/jbx-protocol/juice-contracts-v2/pull/240))\n\n- [Simplified veBanny contract and added support to redeem multiple veBannys at once](https://github.com/jbx-protocol/jbx-staking/pull/13)\n\n- [Moved all V2 Errors to prevent conflicts](https://github.com/jbx-protocol/juice-contracts-v2/pull/240/commits/3f477da12564fb69e78931ab9a3474091f6a1c2d)\n\n- [Wrote proof-of-concept code for AppleJuice terminal](https://discord.com/channels/775859454780244028/967931835197845564/968296173960052746) and [brainstormed with](https://discord.com/channels/775859454780244028/967931835197845564/968336216141479936) @Dr Gorilla on the architecture\n\n- Found and fixed potential issue(s) in veBanny contract ([Fixes](https://github.com/jbx-protocol/jbx-staking/pull/12), [Discord explanation](https://discord.com/channels/775859454780244028/961007548553637970/966131838122872894))\n\n- Various other minor fixes and updates (such as [#1](https://github.com/jbx-protocol/juice-interface/commit/685b0d88067709866802124fd5b2e093571f3b35), [#2](https://github.com/jbx-protocol/juice-docs-v2/commit/a008d01172b94f1f30206ac6b1c3ef6cf2e39429)) \n\nAs I get more comfortable with the Juicebox codebase i’ll be able to increase my productivity and start shipping more code per cycle.\n\n## Risks:\n\n- Lower quality or less code 🚢ed\n\n- 0xBA5ED could vanish\n\n## Specification:\n\n$3000 trial payout for funding cycle 22 to `0x1864822f9b32ed59a456a1eeec2a83c76637f33f`\n\n## Rationale:\n\nI had a hard time figuring out what amount to propose for this trial payout, after discussing with a Juicebox contributor $3000 was suggested as a good trial payment, which imo is a fair amount for both me and the DAO. As this gives me the opportunity to keep working 30-50(+) hours a week and provide more contributions to hopefully start a recurring payment in the future. \n\n## Timeline:\n\nEnter trial payout for one (1) cycle, during FC #22 \n\n## Copyright Disclaimer:\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n\n\n---\n[Discussion Thread](https://discord.com/channels/775859454780244028/873248745771372584/971936804867555329) | [IPFS](https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/Qme4KYGmVtuJEyYS3gd4nWNeDgoEw2Ye3SHPtTUi3VuCVu)",

      "content": "\n \n```plain text\nTitle: DAOPlanet.NYC Sponsorship and Partnership\nAuthor: Steven Echtman (@DAOofSteve)\nDate: 2022-05-06\n```\n\n## Thesis:\n\nSponsor and participate in [DAOPlanet.NYC](http://DAOPlanet.NYC), a 2-day Deep Dive DAO conference (June 24th & 25th - right after NFT.NYC), produced by Juicebox Project client [DAOPlanet.org](http://daoplanet.org/) (prev. DAOists.xyz). (See info and sessions from our last event, [DAODenver.org](http://daodenver.org/), our 2-day DAO conference during ETHDenver’s Buidl Week.)\n\nTo sponsor [DAOPlanet.NYC](http://DAOPlanet.NYC) at the Weightless level, Juicebox can distribute $33,333 worth of ETH to the DAOPlanet Juicebox project (currently named “DAODenver”) \n\nSee DAOPlanet.NYC Sponsor Deck: [https://bit.ly/DAOPNYCdeck](https://bit.ly/DAOPNYCdeck)\n\n## Abstract:\n\n[DAOPlanet.org](http://daoplanet.org/) is hosting its second major event, a 2-day DAO Conference  in NYC, right after NFT.NYC. DAOPlanet is inviting Juicebox to sponsor and provide speakers in order to create a win-win-win for Juicebox, DAOPlanet, and attendees. Hundreds of in-person attendees are expected each day, with thousands throughout the world viewing sessions based on the event’s livestream and post-event recordings. (See [DAODenver.org](http://daodenver.org/) for info session recording from our last event.)\n\nAs a Juicebox client and advocate, DAOPlanet is excited to work with Juicebox to help convey how the Juicebox platform not only helps “kickstart” DAOs (through its fundraising features), but also how its versatile contract can be used for DAO Treasury Management, to manage a DAO’s token supply, sell additional tokens as desired, and create ad-hoc fundraising events in the future.\n\nSharable Event Summary:\n\n\tAnnouncing [DAOPlanet.NYC](http://daoplanet.nyc/) (right after NFT.NYC)\n\n\tJoin us on 6/24 & 6/25 for another DAOPlanet Deep Dive into DAOs. (See info and sessions from our last event, [DAODenver](http://daodenver.org/).)\n\n\tDAOPlanet.NYC presents a great opportunity to connect with the top thinkers and operators in the Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) space. Hear from the people behind the major DAOs and those delivering the Web3 tools that make it all possible. (And finally get to meet the people you've been working with!)\n\n\tThis 2-day program encompasses legal structures and considerations, tokenization and tokenomics (including NFTs and fungible tokens), regulatory implications, governance and strategy, and much, much more.\n\n\tWhether you're a seasoned DO practitioner, or interested in the potential for these new types of organizations, you'll come away vastly more equipped and prepared for what lies ahead. See more at [DAOPlanet.NYC](http://daoplanet.nyc/)\n\nEvent revenues go to the production of DAOPlanet.NYC. All remaining funds support the mission and vision of DAOPlanet, a non-profit [TUNA](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/bafybeidiip6wzjmsrociurutwi6hhqghalqnofwnvb2qad2uagfjww5hf4).\n\n## Motivation:\n\nDAOPlanet’s mission is to help over 10 million organizations adopt DAO principles and tools to provide for greater productivity, flexibility, and representation for their contributors. Our vision is greater representation for individuals within communities, organizations, businesses, and the entire world. We create events and content that serves this mission and I believe Juicebox is destined to play an important role in the evolution of organizations. I personally want to do everything I can to help DAO creators, and other orgs adopting DAO principles and Web3 tools, understand how Juicebox can help them succeed at their goals.\n\nDAOPlanet created an arguably successful fundraising event on the Juicebox platform in relation to the DAODenver event, raising Ξ26, and we anticipate utilizing Juicebox (2.0) to fundraise around DAOPlanet.NYC — directing sponsors and donors to transfer their ETH via the Juicebox platform. We attempted to bring Juicebox aboard as a partner for the DAODenver event, but we ran out of time in the proposal discussion process. Regardless of not consummating a sponsorship, Juicebox remains listed as a sponsor on our DAODenver.org website (alongside sponsors, and fellow Juicebox projects, MoonDAO and HeritageDAO).\n\n## Risks:\n\nRisks include the possibility that the NYC event is not as successful as anticipated; “acts of god,” war, or disease (e.g. covid variant based lockdowns) hamper in-person attendance; or other unforeseen circumstances, beyond the control of DAOPlanet team members, prevent critical aspects of the event from proceeding as planned.\n\n## Specification:\n\nThis proposal is for Juicebox to sponsor DAOPlanet.NYC as our “Weightless” tier sponsor. Our temperature checks and conversations with the JuiceBox team indicate a high level of support for this tier and partnership. The “Weightless” tier sponsorship is priced at: $33,333 and includes the following features:\n\n- 3 VIP Tickets & 3 Regular Tickets\n\n- Largest Logo on Website\n\n- Full Screen Logo on Interstitial Screens with 3x Rotation.\n\n- 30-min Speaker Slot and/or 5-min “Pitch.” (I will personally work with the Juicebox team to coordinate members for speaking and panelist opportunities).\n\n- Priority Venue Placement with 2x Size Table/Booth.\n\n- 3 Large Complementary Banners Prominently Displayed\n\n- Dedicated Liaison Access for any Event Related Support.\n\n- 3.33 ETH in DAOPlanet Utility Tokens (through Juicebox project or airdrop).\n\n- 6 DAOPlanet Event Series NFTs\n\nIn addition, this sponsorship package includes one free upgrade, which will be determined via Juicebox server seshbot poll:\n\n- Badge / Lanyard Branding\n\n- Cocktail Party Sponsor\n\n- 1 day Lunch Sponsor\n\n- 2 day Breakfast Sponsor\n\n- 2 day Wifi Branding\n\n- Event T-Shirt - Primary Sponsor (included)\n\n- Potential for more options and customizations, determined via seshbot poll, we can think of and include after voting closes.\n\nSee sponsorship deck for more details: [https://bit.ly/DAOPNYCdeck](https://bit.ly/DAOPNYCdeck)\n\n(Also, any consideration for previous and continued inclusion as a DAODenver sponsor can be considered as part of this proposal.)\n\nAll tiers can be paid for via ETH into DAOPlanet’s Juicebox project, and sponsors will receive DAOPlanet governance tokens, Event Series NFT(s), and tickets to the event based on their tier.\n\nDAOPlanet’s sponsorship team (including myself) will work to assure the Juicebox partnership is a success at whatever sponsorship level is selected. This includes warm-hot introductions to prospective projects, investors, media, and other valuable partners. This also includes customizing the selected sponsorship package to meet Juicebox’s objectives.\n\nWith a paid sponsorship the DAOPlanet team and I will work with Juicebox to craft a stage presentation and/or panel discussion that not only engages and educates attendees and other speakers, but that works to deliver an “aha moment” to those who thought Juicebox was merely a crypto version of Kickstarter. When more people realize all the things they can accomplish with the platform and underlying contract, they will be anxious to engage further and create projects.\n\nUpon approval of this proposal Juicebox can distribute $33,333 worth of ETH to the DAOPlanet Juicebox project (currently named “DAODenver”) to sponsor DAOPlanet.NYC\n\n## Rationale:\n\nJuicebox has the opportunity to gain additional visibility and attract a wider variety of organizations and projects to its platform. DAOPlanet can help Juicebox reach a larger broader market through event participation, and introduction to DAOs that are interested in DAO treasury management through the Juicebox platform in addition to its fundraising and direct minting capabilities. More and more conventional organizations are also looking to adopt tokens for various aspects of their business. This could include token sales to employees, contractors, customers, and vendors, and even fundraisers for specific projects or initiatives. Juicebox may be the best contract for these organizations to mint on as well.\n\nUltimately the rationale and desire is to create a win-win-win for Juicebox, DAOPlanet, and attendees. This may require some up-front investment into a sponsorship, but the expectation is that this investment will pay dividends in creating long lasting relationships and generating additional projects that more than cover the near term sponsorship costs.\n\n## Timeline:\n\nDAOPlanet.NYC is being held on June 24th and 25th, right after NFT.NYC, taking advantage of the thousands of crypto enthusiasts congregating in NYC that week.\n\nAs soon as this proposal is approved (with preparation happening as soon as there’s an indication of success), DAOPlanet will begin delivering sponsorship benefits to Juicebox, and working with Juicebox reps and speakers to assure maximum benefit from the sponsorship.\n\n## Copyright Disclaimer:\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n\n\n---\n[Discussion Thread](https://discord.com/channels/775859454780244028/873248745771372584/972226503658045510) | [IPFS](https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmcGVfgBdewFBXdbTPE94S6nJtERtDhnpepq8KgdRXboRS)",

      "content": "\n\n```plain text\nTitle: One time payout for jigglyjams for governance automation\nAuthor: jigglyjams\nDate: 05/06/2022\n```\n\n## Thesis:\n\nExecute a one-time payout of $1500 USD payed in ETH to jigglyjams.eth (0x25910143c255828f623786f46fe9a8941b7983bb)\n\n## Abstract:\n\nI (jigglyjams) have been working with filipv and Stevie G on automating the Juicebox governance process (aka nance) (see [https://juicebox.notion.site/Governance-Automation-Overview-772dc68367a741fe9d96f768997a28eb](https://juicebox.notion.site/Governance-Automation-Overview-772dc68367a741fe9d96f768997a28eb) and [https://discord.com/channels/775859454780244028/955977240787685416](https://discord.com/channels/775859454780244028/955977240787685416) for more details).\n\nA diagram on how the automation works can be found here: [https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmZ4kNCBqCYUoNj7FNYGU1PdhUeiBzq3ur8LmgABjrwWxv](https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmZ4kNCBqCYUoNj7FNYGU1PdhUeiBzq3ur8LmgABjrwWxv)\n\n## Motivation:\n\nManually shepherding data across the various platforms Juicebox uses for governance is not a feasible task for any person. Things must be executed in a timely manner in order to adhere to the governance process laid out by the DAO. What if the amazing governance facilitators are busy at that moment? Will proposals still get uploaded to snapshot? These processes must be automated in order to better exemplify a true autonomous organization.\n\nRecently there was some confusion on what causes a snapshot vote to pass or fail. This occurred because a proposal that technically passed was marked as fail due to confusion about how “For” votes are meant to be counted. This must be automated to prevent any other voting outcome mistakes.\n\n## Risks:\n\n- The automations do not work well\n\n- The automations open up the DAOs snapshot to anyone with the automation private key to upload proposals\n\n- There are bugs in the code that will cause a mistake in snapshot vote counting\n\n## Specification:\n\nExecute a one-time payout of $1500 USD payed in ETH to jigglyjams.eth (0x25910143c255828f623786f46fe9a8941b7983bb)\n\nThe automation already works with the existing tools Juicebox uses and nance has already been added as an author on snapshot so no further technical requirements are necessary\n\n## Rationale:\n\nI (jigglyjams) have spent probably over 300 hours on this project this far mainly on nights and weekends. This is a small payment for the time that the nance automation has already saved filipv and Stevie G.\n\n## Timeline:\n\nTo be executed after approval on snapshot\n\n## Copyright Disclaimer:\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n\n\n---\n[Discussion Thread](https://discord.com/channels/775859454780244028/873248745771372584/972277325964144640) | [IPFS](https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmcfjvrQL32o6mpVoaUkLnr9AwcJjKhT4Sb3ARosMKZuQ9)",

Peel is the team that builds and maintains juicebox.money.\n\n## Motivation:\n\nPeel currently has the following responsibilities:\n\n- Maintain any and all frontend-related work on juicebox.money, rinkeby.juicebox.money, and all related Juicebox interfaces.\n\n- Design & implement a frontend experience based on changes to the JB protocol (such as V2).\n\n- Research & deliver customer insights.\n\n- Manage juicebox.money domain.\n\n- Building and maintaining the Juicebox Subgraph on TheGraph.\n\nSince the inception of Peel in FC#15 we have been delivering on this promise. Our big project thus far has been adding support for the Juicebox V2 protocol on the frontend and in the Subgraph, which so far has been a success (we’re [live on Rinkeby](https://rinkeby.juicebox.money/#/)).\n\nAs the builders of the [juicebox.money](http://juicebox.money) web app, any set of features that will become part of this app is our responsibility. To that end, we are requesting a payout increase to increase our bandwidth and accelerate the development of important projects relevant to all JBX holders:\n\n- veBanny and staking. If veBanny is to become part of the core [juicebox.money](http://juicebox.money) app, then Peel will be responsible for its development (or at least stewarding its development).\n\n- Funding via NFTs. We are investigating the feasibility of letting projects reward contributors with NFTs.\n\n- Multi-token funding. We will soon be investigating the ability for projects to accept select ERC-20 tokens (in addition to ETH) as payments.\n\nThis is also not to mention the backlog of features to improve the existing app and functionality (currently 88 issues: [https://github.com/jbx-protocol/juice-interface/issues](https://github.com/jbx-protocol/juice-interface/issues))\n\n## Risks:\n\n- Peel doesn’t use the funds to help grow Juicebox (by not paying new contributors, etc.)\n\n- Peel doesn’t deliver on projects\n\n## Specification:\n\nIncrease Peel’s current recurring payout to US$46,000 per funding cycle.\n\n## Rationale:\n\nWe are requesting an increase of US$16,000 per funding cycle. We are looking to onboard/”hire” 2-3 recurring contributors. The payouts for these contributors will vary, but we are budgeting for an additional US$8,000 per week (US$2,000 - US$3,000 per contributor per week) to pay new contributors.\n\nOur current team (3 developers) is at capacity with our current workload.\n\nWe have actively been “recruiting” folks in the last funding cycle, and already have a 2-3 new contributors poking around the codebase and helping on small features. We have ratified a “hiring” process here: [https://juicebox.notion.site/Become-a-paid-contributor-0d5a3f77fdb34da1bde73e5a824b2f2d](https://juicebox.notion.site/Become-a-paid-contributor-0d5a3f77fdb34da1bde73e5a824b2f2d)\n\n## Timeline:\n\nThis should take effect starting in FC#21.\n\n## Copyright Disclaimer:\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n",

      "content": "\n```plain text\nTitle: DrGorilla.eth recurring payout update\nAuthor: DrGorilla.eth\nDate: 22 Apr 2022\n```\n\n## Thesis:\n\nDrGorilla.eth (him/he) has been actively contributing to the development, integration and test of Juicebox protocol V2, as a contract engineer. He’s currently paid under the fair market value of a contract engineer and of a software engineer. This proposal offers to pay him 18500$ per funding cycle.\n\n## Abstract:\n\nBesides speaking of himself at the third person, DrGorilla.eth has been reliably available to (try to) code whatever was needed or whatever he found was useful for Juicebox, on a typical DeFi schedule (ie 7 days per week, fully timezone agnostic). There is now an opportunity cost with other projects (both web2 and web3) which should be covered for him to stay. \n\n## Motivation:\n\nSo far, DrGorilla.eth has been contributing in various facets of the Juicebox Protocol V2 alongside @Jango . After having written unit tests in a “standard” way, in Javascript, he brought Foundry to the game (with initial help from @Exekias and @dhyon which, unfortunately, both left). This addition led to the discovery of so-called “pretty gnarly bugs”. The initial tooling shift it implied wasn’t straightforward, but he carried on, driven by both a curiosity for the tool itself as well as a desire to test every facets of the protocol, to ensure its safety to our community.\n\nHe has been pursuing thorough testing and implementation since then, up until the current final push (45 pull requests opened since Dec 01) [https://github.com/jbx-protocol/juice-contracts-v2/issues?q=author%3Adrgorillamd](https://github.com/jbx-protocol/juice-contracts-v2/issues?q=author%3Adrgorillamd)\n\nHe’s now, since the V2 is being broadcasted by miners at the exact time of writing of this proposal, slowly shifting his mind to new parts of Juicebox V2, which will be part of his future work&tasks:\n\n- Treasury extension: a recurring discussion which happened in the v2-testing thread is “how to implement a way to automatically generate yield on project treasury”. DrGorilla.eth has suggested and started implementing a customised terminal, which would allow contributors or other projects to easily invest their overflow (or even full treasury) in multiple strategies (while keeping this overflow fully redeemable, at any time).\n\n- V2 integration: DrGorilla.eth has been trying to provide clear and (hopefully) correct informations, mainly to @johnnyD and @aeolian, in order to implement some of the various additions the V2 brings - with customised treasury extensions, this collaboration will increase (even if the amount of gifs will be seen as spam per #frontend chan standards).\n\n- veBanny: while not being part of his core work so far, he has been peaking (and will continue) peaking to distillate some (sometime) useful comments on the contract\n\nWhile this proposal is not related to it, he cofounded Moody’sDAO, a due-diligence provider, aiming to summarise relevant data about Juicebox projects to our community, and still actively work on it. He now hopes to find other unmet needs which he would be able to fill.\n\n## Risks:\n\n- Disappearance of DrGorilla.eth - mitigated by the already long time and commitment he displayed.\n\n- Lack of work ethic - drunk coding is a plague\n\n- Poor code quality - hopefully mitigated by peers, if applicable\n\n## Rationale:\n\nTalent retention has been proven difficult in DeFi projects, diligent contract engineers being hard to find and keep - this would offer a competitive compensation in order to do so (higher compensation would be similar to @Jango ‘s one, and to be honest, he’s really more badass than DrGorilla is).\n\n## Timeline:\n\nDirect implementation in FC #21, for a standard 90-days period\n\n## Copyright Disclaimer:\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n",

We’ve been trying to keep mainnet deploys to a minimum, but will likely have deployed all contracts twice before we’re officially good to go. I’ve been funding the deployer account from my wallet to get everything up and tested.\n\nThis proposal refunds jango.eth for funds sent to the deployer wallet to deploy V2 and V1.1.\n\nThere are currently 1.34 ETH left in the deployer contract for future deployments.\n\n## Specification:\n\nOnce all deploys are up, calculate how much ETH was spent and move this amount from the multisig safe to jango.eth. Withdraw sufficient funds from the next funding cycle to make sure the multisig safe has enough ETH for the transaction. Comes out to 5.5 ETH.\n\ntxs:\n\nDeploying V2\n[https://etherscan.io/tx/0x4a7fde7ecefd0ffd12b4ea3d29da85f888014c468d4d7bd9d1c14fc945e9f04d](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x4a7fde7ecefd0ffd12b4ea3d29da85f888014c468d4d7bd9d1c14fc945e9f04d)\n\n[https://etherscan.io/tx/0xa3d57f412a602e86e31d8ba27ba8062d89ad409e1e92ff0dea1ce978ec1d67aa](https://etherscan.io/tx/0xa3d57f412a602e86e31d8ba27ba8062d89ad409e1e92ff0dea1ce978ec1d67aa)\n\nDeploying V1.1\n\n[https://etherscan.io/tx/0x601f777ab018dfc6f1f91fecb9cef2b72bf9262f453b1471cde433d437973cf8](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x601f777ab018dfc6f1f91fecb9cef2b72bf9262f453b1471cde433d437973cf8)\n\n## Copyright Disclaimer:\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n\n",

Matthew and Brileigh will co-host and handle all production related tasks.\n\n## Motivation:\n\nWe have been regularly attending town halls since March and it is clear that we want to become dedicated contributors at Juicebox **🧃**\n\nWe have experience producing podcasts in the web3 space and would love to continue the previous podcast series hosted by @nicholas and produced by @0xSTVG + @filipv.eth. This trial period will allow us to dedicate the time needed for pre-production, hosting, and post-production in order to make the podcast consistent and high-quality.\n\nOur goal with this podcast is to create a cultural anthropology of Juicebox through interviews with community members building and maintaining projects using the protocol. We’ll be talking to a wide range of builders within the JB ecosystem to show the range of projects that Juicebox enables.\n\nHere is a sample of episodes that we have planned:\n\n📜 A retrospective episode on ConstitutionDAO\n\n🕵️‍♂️ A deep-dive into the Juicebox sleuths at Moody DAO\n\n🚀 The crypto space race with Moon DAO \n\n🏗 Lexicon Devils and metaverse architecture\n\n🏘️ Exploring DAO governance to run a town IRL with Sätra Brunn\n\ntldr; we love JB and want to spend more time here **💕**\n\n## Risks:\n\n- Both [Untitled](https://www.notion.so/f2e36c73f12a4fddaceb4bcb35c6c9ff) and [Untitled](https://www.notion.so/082e9b5acc1c457d9f379f8815505e1c) are new contributors to Juicebox\n\n- Respecting the production timeline in order to release bi-weekly episodes\n\n- As a coven, Brileigh _does_ have the ability to cast spells... even curses... 🪄\n\n## Specification:\n\n$1000 trial payout for [Untitled](https://www.notion.so/6243b58f8ed34fc8889c6c3eafab0235) and [Untitled](https://www.notion.so/d2924a06615e4a208737c6fcc1921127) to matthewbrooks.eth\n\n$1000 trial payout for [Untitled](https://www.notion.so/6243b58f8ed34fc8889c6c3eafab0235) and [Untitled](https://www.notion.so/d2924a06615e4a208737c6fcc1921127) to brileigh.eth\n\n## Rationale:\n\nThe previous production budget paid was [$1500 per funding cycle](/aa2f92f5ffc545e28fd7bff6964ca33d) and this proposal reflects the added preparation needed as co-hosts.\n\n## Timeline:\n\nWe recorded our first episode with dropnerd from SharkDAO on April 11, 2022 and will release an edited episode by April 25. We welcome feedback from the community on this first episode and will make changes as needed going forward.\n\nThe podcast will be produced on a bi-weekly basis i.e. one episode produced for [Untitled](https://www.notion.so/6243b58f8ed34fc8889c6c3eafab0235) and one for [Untitled](https://www.notion.so/d2924a06615e4a208737c6fcc1921127). Pre-production and recording will take place during the first week of the funding cycle and post-production will be finished during the second week.\n\n## Copyright Disclaimer:\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n",

Expenses incurred and development effort related to JBX including port to Polygon, UX development, v2 NFT features including backend, veBanny tokenURI Resolver, veBanny voting NFT compositing, NFT minting and transferring of veBanny, Disco Banny “Commemorative multi signature” mint, NFT SVG, and various other activities and expenses outlined here. \n\n[https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmQ25n63BhBc3TRwjRx3LFfMuoUAZQwhfChD9DZSV7Yo58](https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmQ25n63BhBc3TRwjRx3LFfMuoUAZQwhfChD9DZSV7Yo58)\n\n**Fully acknowledge that some of these expenses in linked doc are personal, albeit, in the spirit of spreading ETH into the JB ecosystem, not asking for reimbursement, for those items. All these expenses were done without expectation of reimbursement but that some of which directly benefit Juicebox DAO. Detailed below,*  \n\n## Motivation:\n\n*Tankbottoms.eth has incurred the following expenses:*\n\n1. Minted veBanny prototypes and airdropped to community members (contract deployment and ~$8-10 to WAGMI Gnosis and then the same per token per person transfer), see Financial Contributions section from the IPFS activities.\n    \n    https://etherscan.io/address/0x173bf0d493B48B7df98435B721A86Adb1a92DD4C\n    \n2. Contributed to the veBanny tokenURIResolver computation to veBanny IPFS assets, Solidity.\n    \n    https://github.com/tankbottoms/jbx-staking/tree/feature/JBveTokenUriResolver\n    \n3. Minted Disco Banny for distribution to community members, see Financial Contributions section from the IPFS activities\n    \n    [https://rainbow.me/0x6a67c678eFb4a61635fFBaEbcD38B3370009592f](https://rainbow.me/0x6a67c678eFb4a61635fFBaEbcD38B3370009592f)\n    \n    https://etherscan.io/address/0x6a67c678eFb4a61635fFBaEbcD38B3370009592f\n    \n4. Researched NFT SVG default project designs for v2, modified UniSwap SVG contract, Re-wrote Tile Contract, and settled upon version of a BannyVerse player cards.\n    \n    https://nameless-meadow-0705.on.fleek.co/\n    \n5. Forked Juicebox and deployed on Polygon Testnet and Mainnet including updating front-end chainlink data feed for MATIC to USD, MATIC Subgraph, UX updates, Typescript, Hardhat deployment scripts. https://github.com/tankbottoms, matic.tankbottoms.xyz.\n    \n    https://github.com/tankbottoms/juice-contracts-v2\n    \n    [https://github.com/tankbottoms/juice-interface](https://github.com/tankbottoms/juice-interface)\n    \n    https://github.com/tankbottoms/juice-subgraph\n    \n6. Setup and distributed the Polygon Gnosis Safe to 4 Juicebox original multi-signers and ensured all addresses had MATIC to execute any transactions. see Financial Contributions section from the IPFS activities. (MATIC, GRAPH)\n7. Additionally paid consultants and contributors illustrator natasha-pankina.eth, developer github.com/t4sk to audit the v2 contracts, and developer evmcompatible to participate in the above work including future v2 activities.\n\n# Risks:\n\n1. Setting a tone in JBDAO where contributors are expected to be compensated for work they were not explicitly tasked with.\n2. Conversely, setting a tone that coming in and pushing forward on known JBDAO areas of interest, self-directed and funded work is not something JBDAO wants. Which I think JBDOA does want. \n\n## Specification:\n\nMulti-signature execute a one-time payout of treasury for $20,500 and a one time payout of Gnosis safe for 2m $JBX. \n\n## Rationale:\n\n## Timeline:\n\nUpon successful completion of a snapshot vote.\n\n## Copyright Disclaimer:\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n\nIPFS - https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmNrVGhMT6Sr1T8ey92jJnddvkjy5p6NJ5qaWJXKko4u7t\n\nDiscord discussion - https://discord.com/channels/775859454780244028/873248745771372584/962008783310172210\n",

      "title": "JBP-141 - AssangeDAO return JBX for ETH(5% Juicebox fee)",
      "content": "\n```\nTitle: AssangeDAO return JBX for ETH\nAuthor: AssangeDAO\nDate: 04/07/2021\n```\n\n## Abstract:\n\nAssangeDAO, a non for profit DAO for a noble cause focuses on making efforts to freeing imprisoned cypherpunk, technologist and publisher Julian Assange. AssangeDAO requests a refund of the 5%(ETH871.13) fees paid to Juicebox. These funds will be used to continue the AssangeDAO mission. If this proposal is passed, AssangeDAO will give back all its JBX tokens it received for the ETH871.13 retained by Juicebox.\n\n## Motivation:\n\nAssangeDAO’s core mission is to inspire a powerful solidarity network and fight for the freedom of Julian Assange. In doing this it seeks to safeguard the rights and liberties of people everywhere. AssangeDAO is one of the most successful DAOs of all time, having outpaced its record-setting predecessor, ConstitutionDAO. ConstitutionDAO raised ETH11,613. AssangeDAO raised ETH17,422. Whereas ConstitutionDAO is a for profit vehicle designed to enable its purchasers to possess a specific item, AssangeDAO is a charitable cause built around protecting the very freedoms upon which Juicebox and other DAOs and platforms are dependent. It is in this sense that charging the AssangeDAO a fee might have some reputational cost to Juicebox, considering objectively lesser causes did not incur such costs.\n\nSupporters contributed ETH17,422 to the AssangeDAO via Juicebox. To accomplish the mission to free Assange, AssangeDAO decided to use all available ETH to purchase the Pak x Assange NFT Clock. Pak donated all the ETH to the Wau Holland Stiftung(Foundation) in Germany that funds Assanges' legal defense and campaign for his freedom.\n\nThe decision to use all available ETH to purchase the Pak x Assange NFT was based, in part, on the notion that there would be a pathway available to AssangeDAO for the return of the Juicebox fee so AssangeDAO could continue to operate after it had achieved its first objective. There were discussions to this nature early on in the AssangeDAOs creation.\n\nBecause the suggested Juicebox refund was never properly ratified, it has led to uncertainty as to the overall liquidity of AssangeDAO and the noble purpose it has and will continue to serve. We believe strongly that refunding the fees will serve as a firestarter, and enable our partnership to continue apace, benefitting both DAOs immensely over time.\n\n- Juicebox is the first business partner of AssangeDAO and was part of a massive success story being written into history books even now. Quite literally, the two DAOs have made change on a grand scale possible. We feel a sense of community toward the JuiceboxDAO and envision many rewarding collaborative projects in the future.\n- AssangeDAO, as a part of this proposition would continue to express its gratitude towards Juicebox via social media platforms in order to help Juicebox grow in popularity as well as influence. In fact, many people first heard about Juicebox because they read news about AssangeDAO’s record-breaking raise. In future media and social media posts, AssangeDAO will make every effort to mention Juicebox’s collaborations with AssangeDAO and work toward the maximization of Juicebox’s public profile.\n\nPending likely community approval, a more official partnership could be considered as well. We strongly feel that JuiceboxDAO and its respective platform could benefit long-term from such an association and the innumerable projects the AssangeDAO intends to undertake. It is also an opportunity for JuiceboxDAO to gain a priceless kind of notoriety as a defender of free speech in an era of rampant global censorship.\n\n**What will AssangeDAO do with the returned ETH?**\n\nAssangeDAO intends to use the Juicebox fees as operational funds that can help directly or indirectly bring about Assange’s freedom and support causes such as Freedom of Speech, Freedom of Information and Whistleblowing. We believe everyone, no matter where you live or which DAO you belong to, will benefit significantly from these projects. How the ETH is allocated will be decided by the AssangeDAO community based on the DAO’s governance structure.\n\nAssangeDAO award is one example of a proposal being considered by the community.\n\n## Risks:\n\nWhile there is a risk that other such major projects would attempt to follow a precedent set by this refund, we feel our circumstances and partnership are unique enough in nature that such future requests by other projects would not have hold over Juicebox operation or likely be able to meet a standard of refund policy set here.\n\nAlthough the magnitude of the refund is large, we believe the overall potential gain here vastly outweighs any risks incurred by either party. As much as AssangeDAO would directly benefit from the infusion of funds, JuiceboxDAO would solidify a powerful alliance that would be able to genuinely assist its expansion.\n\nA refund to AssangeDAO will be offset by the return of AssangeDAO JBX tokens to Juicebox.\n\n## Specification:\n\nETH871 returned to AssangeDAO gnosis safe from Juicebox Treasury and JBX87,478,938.89 sent from AssangeDAO to burn address.\n\n## Timeline:\n\nNext funding cycle.\n\n## Copyright Disclaimer:\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n\nIPFS - https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmSA4aBGfbhJ2MCNYkygqAMQWpcVQTdEWG5UWnXkwZejLK\n\nDiscord Discussion - https://discord.com/channels/775859454780244028/873248745771372584/961754616503091270\n",

      "content": "```\nTitle: Increase Jango’s recurring payout\nAuthor: Mieos/ Tankbottoms\nDate: 2022-04-07\n```\n\n## Thesis:\n\nIncrease to Jango’s recurring payout to $21,000 from $15,000\n\n## Abstract:\n\nJango’s contribution in both facilitating many aspects of JB from onboarding new treasuries to developing v2 contracts, JB should compensate him at least at market rate. This proposal attempts to bring him slightly under market for someone of his capability.\n\n## Motivation:\n\nCompetent, articulate, creative smart contract developers are like albino unicorns. JB must 1) continue to motivate top developer talent to attract the same, 2) compensate developers to demand their undivided attention, 3) send the message that working for JB can and is competitive to meat-space activities.\n\n## Risks:\n\nJango will rest on his laurels while milking the JB treasury.\n\n## Specification:\n\nMultisig members update recurring funding distributions to $21,000\n\n## Rationale:\n\nDirect quote from Tankbottoms:\n\n> *Having personally reviewed hundreds of blockchain developer resumes and participated in as many interviews, I have an idea of the marketplace of both talent and compensation. I am also responsible for hiring at two well funded (100m+ value) entities the same and the floor for a competent resource with the above talent is $400k and the ceiling is $1m, admittedly there is no category for Jango, but ensuring he is compensated in meat-space to continue to focus his attention is reasonable.*\n> \n\n> *Without specifically doing an accounting on Jango’s wallet, I’m pretty sure he has funded / distributed more ETH than he is currently compensated during the last 5 FC, which would mean he is not even breaking even in FC to his various project contributions. Ergo, a future FC proposal warrants giving him an additional ETH budget to sprinkle into the ecosystem.*\n> \n\nMieos: \n\n> There is no replacement for having a Jango involved in nearly every channel and contributing to so many aspects of the value production machine that is Juicebox. Underpaying Jango is like taking paint away from Bob Ross. Give the man all the tools to make the world a more beautiful place. One of those tools is definitely ETH.\n> \n\n## Timeline:\n\nNext funding cycle\n\n## Copyright Disclaimer:\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n\nIPFS - https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmZxueMc7AdJJC2Sk3GZv2ZYQWLJd7ARFk3BLXWFfMujgs\n\nDiscord Discussion - https://discord.com/channels/775859454780244028/873248745771372584/961794198565175357\n\n",

Juicebox DAO is setting up to have a ton of new necessary and delightful features like, NFT MKT, JB Voting token launch, Efforts to bridge to L2’s etc etc. JB DAO needs all the talent it can attract. Besides that Tank is full of unknown amounts of goodie creation. Lets capture this brilliant sprite. \n\n## Motivation:\n\nShow Web3 that anyone who put in a metric shit tons of time, eth, and love for weeks without compensation that JBDAO wants your talents and your magic. Competent, creative smart contract developers are beyond hard to find.  It is in Juicebox DAO’s interest to retain and incentivize such humans to come and play in the JB sandbox.\n\n## Risks:\n\nTankbottoms could find some other sparkling Web3 object and Juicebox could loose his obsessive squirreling predilection which continues to exhume untold value for JB and the ecosystem. Tank has plenty of projects to attend to so there is a risk JBDAO could over pay for his attention. \n\n## Specification:\n\nMultisig executes on a change to the JuiceboxDAO’s payout by adding Tankbottoms.eth  for $16,000\n\n## Rationale:\n\nJuicebox DAO is incentivized to capture and retain any incredible talent for as long as the DAO is producing new exciting products. We also want to signal to Web3 that JBDAO pays full salary to those that come build, edit, craft, and dance on that beautiful code that drives magic internet beans into the JB treasury. Tankbottoms is also incredibly generous and adds tons of value to the broader JB and Web3 ecosystem. **TLDR CLICK ON THIS LINK** 👉 [https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmQ25n63BhBc3TRwjRx3LFfMuoUAZQwhfChD9DZSV7Yo58](https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmQ25n63BhBc3TRwjRx3LFfMuoUAZQwhfChD9DZSV7Yo58) 🤯\n\n## Timeline:\n\nexecute immediately upon gaining sufficient snapshot votes.  \n\n## Copyright Disclaimer:\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n\nIPFS - https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmWuR8Ra3dzkabWgmBh3Chhzwi14PGYBWz9gonEdMh2g3s\n\nDiscord Discussion - https://discord.com/channels/775859454780244028/873248745771372584/962081657458921564\n\n\n",

      "content": "# Thesis\n\nPay Felixander $2,000 per funding cycle for writing and community engagement services, including highlighting JB news through articles, interviews, project and creator blurbs and more on the JB blog.\n\n# Abstract\n\nI’m requesting to be brought on as an ongoing contributor to write for JB. My work helps JB members (both new and old) get to know each other better and learn about new goings-on and happenings as they arise. I am always down to provide writing help in any capacity needed, and would envision being able to further create various articles and prosocial engagement opportunities for community members and contributors.\n\n# Motivation\n\nI have been having an absolute blast writing for the JB blog and I would like to commit more time to doing so. My goal is to be able to create amazing content and to build out what I have started already. I would also love to create some fun community writing events.\n\nLong-term, I would love to turn the JB blog into a news source where people can get really high-quality information about different DAOs, their aims, needs and progress.\n\n# Risks\n\nI am asking to be brought on as a regular contributor, which is admittedly a big deal. I feel strongly that I am here to stay at JB and that I enjoy the work and can add to the community, but any decision to bring on a contributor involves risk that should be weighed carefully.\n\n# Timeline\n\nI have started this work and am in the process of continuing it. With the support of this proposal passing I will be able to produce more work more frequently, and will hopefully be able to create more in-depth articles as well.\n\n# Transparency and gratitude\n\nI have to give a huge thank-you to all of you who helped me by giving interviews, and to filipv for onboarding me and guiding me through a lot of things at JB. To be open and transparent, I have a really hard time assigning value to my own contributions. The resources I’m asking for are what will allow me to be able to throw myself at JB’s writing needs with all of my heart, which is what I would like to do.

Did they know there are better price on Uniswap?\n- The protocol revenue has covered the expense, there are not much need for further fundrasing for now. The discontinuation of individual donations, on the one hand, accounts for a very small percentage, and has little impact; on the other hand, it allows room for secondary market trading.\n- Individual donations to mint tokens amount enables potential “unlimited incremental issuance”, leading to a long-term divergence between token value and secondary market price, and discouraging the acceptance of JBX on CEX and the entry of investors.\n- Stopping individual donations and raising the token price and value floor will also allow fundraising project parties to see the price of JBX tokens and be willing to hold them for the long term and grow with Juicebox.\n- Properly incentivizing the secondary market performance of token prices can lead to a better community atmosphere and people are more confident to participate in the community, cf. MoonDAO.\n- The price will basically not exceed the current issue price, so it does not raise the entry barrier for members afterwards, while also retaining the channel for platform projects to continue to pay fees to obtain JBX\n\n## Timeline:\n\nTake effect immediately, namely FC19.\n\n## Copyright Disclaimer:\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n\nIPFS - https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmeckqGTn3fD5U4KGTpRBC3mzBgtpjQor16yKf1hLSoo9V\n\nDiscord Discussion - https://discordapp.com/channels/775859454780244028/873248745771372584/956756333133201458",

I found that their is a significant legal hurdle to pass that I did not fully grasps at the time of that proposal. Similarly, I foresee similar ongoing risks as I become for aligned with the needs of the DAO and that will dramatically impact my ability to contribute in the simplification and automation of bookkeeping tasks. \n\n### **Payout recipient:**\n\ngulan.eth\n\n### **Payout amount:**\n\n$2000 per funding cycle\n\n### **How have you contributed to the DAO?**\n\nI have been managing the bookkeeping functions for the DAO over the past 4 months:\n\n- Interpret financial governance proposal’s of the Juicebox community\n- Maintain financial records, including one time payments, recurring payments, and jbx reserve list allocations\n- Create a configuration file for each funding cycle for the multisig to approve that contains payroll, vendor reimbursements, and tx fee reimbursements\n\n### How do you want to contribute to the DAO going forward**?**\n\n- Continue facilitating bookkeeping functions for the dao.\n- Project manage Governance Automation with Zeugh and CanuDao\n- Provide a no-bs lens to the use of Juicebox funds\n- Work through the backlog of payments that Juicebox and it’s members have made to vendors and give an accurate accounting of what the current costs are to the DAO\n- Create a dashboard that better articulates the spending of the treasury in terms of financial health and run way projections\n\n### **What does success look like for someone taking on your role?**\n\n- Continued transparency in the bookkeeping documents and process\n- Providing feedback to proposals that impact bookkeeping and create new proposals where necessary or efficient\n- Acceleration of the adoption of governance-automation tools/process\n- Working with other groups/DAO’s in there bookkeeping needs so that Juicebox as a protocol can continue to provide needed services\n\n### **Under what criteria should the community reassess this payout?**\n\n- Accurate funding cycle configurations\n- Transparency into the use of juicebox funds\n- Am I providing feedback to proposals to the DAO that may conflict financially with the status quo, and in those cases of conflict providing the best means to reach the objectives of those authors\n\n### **Sponsors:**\n\n---\n\n**Note: recurring payout recipients are required to participate in votes for future payout allocations.

      "content": "\n```\nTitle: Deploy Juicebox V2 protocol\nAuthor: Jango\nDate: March 25, 2022\n```\n\n## Thesis:\n\nDeploy the juicebox V2 protocol and commit to supporting its adoption.\n\n## Abstract:\n\nJuiceboxDAO will deploy the V2 protocol. Inso doing, it will deploy its treasury on the freshly deployed protocol and begin a slow and steady routine to migrate operations to it over the course of several weeks/months. There’s no rush.\n\n- The V2 contracts can be found [here](https://github.com/jbx-protocol/juice-contracts-v2/tree/main/contracts).\n- The V2 deploy script can be found [here](https://github.com/jbx-protocol/juice-contracts-v2/blob/main/deploy/deploy.js).\n- The V2 protocol’s documentation can be found [here](https://docs.juicebox.money/protocol/protocol).\n    - Overview [here](https://docs.juicebox.money/protocol/learn/overview).\n\nAll other projects operating on V1 can plan a similar course of action if they want to operate on V2.\n\n## Motivation:\n\nTo create a more vibrant, extensible, and convenient Juicebox ecosystem for projects, communities, and developers.\n\n## Risks:\n\nThese risk apply to JuiceboxDAO and all other projects who choose to interact with the V2 protocol.\n\n- **Smart contract risk** — any funds moved over to the V2 ecosystem could be hacked and stolen.\n    - *Mitigation* — continue auditing and putting stress on the codebase.\n- **Communication risk** — V2 adds new functionality and adjusts several details of otherwise-familiar V1 functionality. Sending transactions to the V2 contracts without properly understanding the consequences can lead to inadvertent situations, and in the worst case botched treasuries.\n    - *Mitigation* — be careful when offering support to projects using V2 and communicating about the protocol’s capabilities. Air on the side of not knowing and asking questions until a familiarity is developed.\n- **Operation Risk** — Projects operating multiple treasuries and multiple tokens must attentively manage each of their redemption and issuance rates, and funding cycle configurations in general. For example, if V1 treasury funds are moved to the V2 treasury without also issuing and distributing commensurate V2 project tokens to match the V1 token’s total supply, V2 token holders can redeem them for potentially much more than they should actually be redeemable for at the expense of the rest of the community. When orchestrating multiple treasuries, it is better to temporarily manage token redemption values that are lower than true value instead of higher than true value.\n    - *Mitigation* — be patient and careful when considering a migration strategy for a project. If you are not confident in the outcome of a particular transaction or set of transactions, ask questions.\n\n## Specification:\n\nJuiceboxDAO will deploy the V2 protocol. Inso doing, it will deploy its treasury on the freshly deployed protocol and begin a slow and steady routine to migrate operations to it over the course of several weeks/months. There’s no rush.\n\n- The V2 contracts can be found [here](https://github.com/jbx-protocol/juice-contracts-v2/tree/main/contracts).\n- The V2 deploy script can be found [here](https://github.com/jbx-protocol/juice-contracts-v2/blob/main/deploy/deploy.js).\n- The V2 protocol’s documentation can be found [here](https://docs.juicebox.money/protocol/protocol).\n    - Overview [here](https://docs.juicebox.money/protocol/learn/overview).\n\nAll other projects operating on V1 can plan a similar course of action if they want to operate on V2.\n\n### Phase 1 (immediately)\n\nTodos:\n\n- Run the [deploy script](https://github.com/jbx-protocol/juice-contracts-v2/blob/main/deploy/deploy.js) prior to the start of JuiceboxDAO’s FC#19 on V1. Set the start of JuiceboxDAO’s FC#1 on V2 to be the same as the start of FC#19 on V1 (1649531973) with:\n    - Same funding cycle weight, discount rate, redemption rate, reserved rate, duration, and reserved token distribution as FC#19 on V1.\n    - Target of 0.\n    - No payouts.\n- Issue the new JBX token for JuiceboxDAO’s V2 treasury.\n    - “JBX” symbol and “Juicebox” name.\n- Change the Snapshot strategy to include V2 JBX alongside V1 JBX.\n\nNew projects will be able to build on V2 right away, and current V1 projects can deploy and synchronize a V2 treasury right away just as JuiceboxDAO will do.\n\nDetails:\n\n- As per the deploy script, the current [JuiceboxDAO multisig](https://gnosis-safe.io/app/eth:0xAF28bcB48C40dBC86f52D459A6562F658fc94B1e/balances) will own the V2 treasury NFT.\n- As per the deploy script, the current [JuiceboxDAO multisig](https://gnosis-safe.io/app/eth:0xAF28bcB48C40dBC86f52D459A6562F658fc94B1e/balances) will own the `JBDirectory`, `JBPrices`, `JBProjects`, and `JBETHPaymentTerminal`.\n\n### Phase 2 (As soon as safely possible)\n\nDeploy a simple token swap contract (yet to be written) that allows: \n\n- Owners of V2 projects to initialize a one-way swap function between tokens of a specified V1 project and its V2 token.\n    - Owners will have to give the swap contract permissions to operate its token minting functionality before it can be leveraged by token holders.\n- Any address can mint V2 project tokens through initialized swap functions by sending the appropriate claimed or unclaimed V1 tokens to it.\n\nJuiceboxDAO should allow addresses to covert V1 JBX for V2 JBX using this mechanism.\n\n### Phase 3 (over time)\n\n- As needed, move funds from V1 treasury over to V2, minding the redemption opportunity of outstanding tokens in each treasury inso doing.\n- Adjust V1 and V2 funding cycle payouts and configurations as needed.\n\n## Rationale:\n\nDeploying and migrating to V2 open up lots of opportunities but also lots of risk vectors. We should choose a deployment and migration plan that focuses on mitigating risk in the short term, even if it delays our ability to exploit the new opportunity space a bit.\n\nThe specification outlined allows us to be patient and methodical with the migration.\n\n## Timeline:\n\nSee the [Specification](https://www.notion.so/Deploy-V2-2905203a0cf14734a6fdb156a6c5f2e9).\n\n## Copyright Disclaimer:\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n\nIPFS - https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmSk6bBNxmVak2rckVcwg5XkRpHoD1ZpNgYST7fEwLSVC2\n\nDiscord Discussion - https://discordapp.com/channels/775859454780244028/873248745771372584/956988479508717618",

      "title": "JBP-133 - Bookkeeping changes for translation management in Dework.",
      "content": "```\nTitle: Bookkeeping changes for translation management in Dework.\nAuthor: gulan\nDate: 03/24/2022\n```\n\n## Thesis:\n\nIn order to facilitate JBP-117 ‘Take translations tasks management and payments management from notion and tip.cc to dework’, the bookkeeping team requires changes and clarification to the process outlined in JBP65 ‘Translation Payment specific proposals’ and JBP 113 ‘Redefinition of values and metrics for translation team’.\n\n## Abstract:\n\nIn practice, JP65 requires Zotico to act as a middle man for payments to translators for their work. On a funding cycle basis, this amount varies considerably and also requires Zotico to pre-pay transaction fee’s to be reimbursed at a later time. \n\nFurther,  Zotico has manages this system in google sheets, and requires him to be singularly diligent and accurate in reports. He has done a fantastic job at this. JBP-117 amends this process by utilizing Dework to manage the translation pipeline and allows for immediate payment for work to translators.\n\nDework allows for bounties to be set for individual pre-defined projects. It also allows for a gnosis-safe multi-sig wallet to be integrated in the app. In practice, this means that payment for translations can be initiated in Dework and confirmed in gnosis safe. This system is more efficient, responsive, and less prone to single point failure.\n\n## Motivation:\n\nTranslators do a fantastic and important role in the Juicebox space. The system they use must be able to adequately meet this responsibility as their role and the community continues to expand.\n\n## Risks:\n\nThe actors on the multi-sig wallet misuse the funds.\n\nThe funds are not enough to cover the cost of translation for a given cycle.\n\nThe ‘back-up’ members of the multisig may have minimal regular interaction and may make mistakes if they are not up to date with the current policies (e.g. bounty per word).\n\nTheir is a ‘reviewer’ function in Dework that theoretically should act as a the gateway for submitting payments. However it is not clear to me at the time of this writing that the reviewer role cannot be bypassed. \n\n## Specification:\n\njuicebox will rescind provisions of JBP65 ‘Translation Payment specific proposals’, specifically the methods of payout and reimbursement assigned to Zeugh and Zotico - the bounties for translations will remain the same at “10 cents a word for translator and 5 cents a word for the reviewer”. Further, Juicebox will fund a gnosis-safe wallet ‘juiceboxtrans’ on a JuiceboxDao funding cycle basis in a similar amount to the previous disbursements. For funding-cycle 19, this amount will be $7,000 in eth.\n\nThe gnosis-safe juiceboxtrans ‘owners’ will be:\nzotico: eth:0x6212ce06Dcac01706e6Be5310C3228ede1A02ADf\nzeugh: eth:0xf7253A0E87E39d2cD6365919D4a3D56D431D0041\njango: eth:0x823b92d6a4b2AED4b15675c7917c9f922ea8ADAD\nfilipv: eth:0x30670D81E487c80b9EDc54370e6EaF943B6EAB39\ngulan: eth:0xF8284136B169213E4c50cE09f3E1D9A9b484BAea\n\nThe address of the account to be funded should this proposal pass is:\neth:0x835F397D5cD21eBAe820FDC3fc6eAC98520534ee\n\nBefore the first payments can be used by the juiceboxtrans, Zotico must provide a written explanation in juicebox > bookingkeeping in discord on how payments for translators and reviewers will be separated and processed in accordance to JBP65; the majority members of the ‘juiceboxtrans’ must agree to Zotico’s explanation and will announce that agreement in the same channel.\n\n## Rationale:\n\nThe members of the juiceboxtrans were chosen due to their previous responsibilities in the JBP65, knowledge of juicebox governance, and frequency of availability. The threshold for approving transactions will be 2 members, with the other three acting primarily as backups in case unavailability.\n\nConcerns:\n\nIt is not clear that Dework can handle the distinction between assignee’s and reviewers for payments in accordance to JBP65. In JBP65, translators and reviewers receive different amounts. In Dework, it appears that only the assignee receives the payout. I believe 2 separate task-boards will be needed for translators and reviewers. I have added a stipulate at the end of the specification section for clarity from Zotico on this issue. Hopefully this can be resolved before temp check and stricken from the final proposal.\n\nPayment history:\n\nFC#13\t2388.7\nFC#16\t3359.77\nFC#17\t1616.58\nFC#18\t6051.89\n\nJBP 113 ‘Redefinition of values and metrics for translation team’ authorizes \n\n## Timeline:\n\nAt the start of funding cycle 19, however can be extended due to the specification not being met.\n\n## Copyright Disclaimer:\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n\nIPFS - https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmNzUBge9E4qnj2d2PiAnvjRu1q2VqPU9omjtornFfBcQG\n\nDiscord Discussion - https://discord.com/channels/775859454780244028/873248745771372584/957070038383349901",

      "content": "### **Author:**\n\nMieos\n\n### **Proposal date:**\n\nMarch 10, 2022\n\n### Summary:\n\nWAGMI Studios is in the midst of building out the most culturally important effort in Juicebox’s history. We are collaborating with Jango, Tankbottoms, NatashaPankina, Viraz, Mr. Goldstein and others to create a Locked JBX voting NFT that will be beautifully unique in all of web3. Creating not just a voting token but also a Key to an infinite BannyVerse. \n\n### Risks:\n\nThe risks are not respecting the ETH. Over-payment for a service someone else could do better for less. \n\n### **Payout recipient:**\n\n@wagmistudios\n\n### **Payout amount:**\n\n$9,200 = \n\n$3200 Sage {Art, Illustration, Design, Implimetation}\n\n$3000 Burtula {Animation, Pixel Banny Creator, Bannyverse Co Designer, Bannyverse Collateral}\n\n$2000 Mieos {Art Direction/Curation, Communications, Connect of dots, Pusherman}\n\n$1000 NatashaPankina {Folder Wizard, Layer Auditor}\n\n(There will be a $2000 one-time payment to Natasha from our treasury to back pay for all the hard work she has done so far)\n\n### **How have you contributed to the DAO?**\n\n• Currently working on the visual design aspect of the locked JBX NFT project which will bring better incentives to governance and exposure to Juicebox \n\n• Created 36 emojis and nearly 60 stickers which gives life to the JB Discord\n\n• Created logo, iconic Banny and other Juicebox characters featured on the website\n\n• Creating high quality cultural assets for iconic moments in JB history and for yearly events.\n\n• Collaborated with Lexicon Devils to create a unique digital hangout/education center in Crypto Voxels for Juicebox\n\n• Educational videos to help explain the more technical features of JB \n\n• WAGMI also takes responsibility for being involved from the start by playing rolls in support, onboarding, general channels as well as vibe setting, story telling, teaching, and generally helping drive projects around the JB ecosystem to success through direct engagement. \n\n### How do you want to contribute to the DAO going forward**?**\n\n• With TankBottoms and NatashaPankina help Wagmi plans to have all the assets ready for the switch to VeJBX voting. We are currently working on the visual assets and a UI that that will make this complex experience feel simple.  (Visuals for the NFT, and UI for website) \n\n• With TankBottoms and NatashaPankina help Wagmi plans to Build out a second minting experience where VeJBX holders can personalize their Banny - Secondary Banny sales will be split with JB DAO & Tank/Natasha (details TBD)and WAGMI\n\n• Continue to experiment using Art, Design, and Animation to expand the cultural reach of Juicebox and Banny. \n\n• Hopefully play a roll in the long awaited Juicebox NFT Marketplace.\n\n• Continue to add value to other projects around the ecosystem though support, education, and unique high quality cultural assets. We will constantly strive to bring community support from every angle including 1 on 1 to make sure every JB project has every tool and understanding they need to succeed! \n\n### **What does success look like for someone taking on your role?**\n\n• A world where everyone with JBX has a dope PixelBanny to flex.\n\n •   When JBDAO and JB team are partially known for the brand aesthetic \n\n•  JBDAO and Discord becomes iconic and completely unique in web3 for its vibes, education, and exposure techniques.\n\n• When onboarding no longer includes questions about token mechanics.\n\n### **Under what criteria should the community reassess this payout?**\n\n• When a week goes by and you don't experience see WAGMI making moves!  \n\n### **Sponsors:**\n\n*List community members who agree to act as spokespeople for this proposal.*\n\n---\n\n**Note: recurring payouts recipients are required to participate in votes for future payout allocations. For payouts to non-EOAs, attach an address that will manage voting on the non-EOA address's behalf.**\n\nIPFS\nhttps://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/Qmb8vqrSyKLeU3fWQZ5VeiCU2rj1MCZWQceBKSeJQ1h9Yi\n\nDiscord Discussion\nhttps://discord.com/channels/775859454780244028/873248745771372584/951938458077761616\n",

      "content": "# **Onboarding Audit of Juicebox’s Process - DAO Masters**\n\n### **Author:**\n\nAngelaa\n\n### **Payout recipient:**\n\ndaomstr.eth\n\n### **Proposal date:**\n\nMar 2, 2022\n\n### **Summary of your proposal.**\n\nWe would like to work together to help Juicebox and CANUDAO improve the process of onboarding new DAO operators (= who are contributing and building on top of Juicebox). In order to lay the foundation for Juicebox and CANUDAO, DAO Masters is suggesting to establish a long-term working relationship, starting with an initial discovery phase.\n\nThis would include:\n\n- Auditing 2 onboarding sessions led by Jango and Zeugh with new members of the DAO.\n- Debriefing with Jango and Zeugh to document the FAQs onboarding process. This will give us a sense of what context, permissions, and documentation might be needed.\n\nThe goal of the initial discovery phase is to develop growth objectives for 2022 and form a more detailed plan for optimizing collaboration across the Juicebox ecosystem. We would like to timebox the initial discovery phase to 2 weeks.\n\n### **What gaps do you see in the DAO's process, and how might you help to fill them?**\n\nBased on a conversation with Jango and Zeugh (1/31/2022), DAO Masters believe the main issues Juicebox are facing, are:\n\n1. There is a need for more onboarding calls and support. There are a lot of people who want to build on top of Juicebox and the team spends 1-2 days a week fielding onboarding calls.\n2. The onboarding process and resources could be improved: DAO Operators who build on top of Juicebox are currently supporting others ramp up onto Juicebox, however there are no formal responsibilities or incentives.\n3. While the onboarding channel provides an outlet for members to join and ask questions, there isn’t a structured process to improve the knowledge of the DAO operators to the point they feel able to lead onboarding calls themselves.\n4. Although Juicebox has general tutorials for all configurations, they need a better way to standardize the process to build new materials anytime a new configuration has been added.\n\nIn answer to these gaps, DAO Masters believes that they can help Juicebox, by:\n\n1. Audit the onboarding experience from a new Dao Operators perspective as well as those more experienced ones who are currently volunteering to help with onboarding (including roles, process & resources).\n2. Collect the latest research and case studies from Dao Masters and CANU network to identify potential new approaches.\n3. Develop a proposal for implementing a new onboarding playbook & tooling, in collaboration with CANUDao, that includes a 'Train-the-Trainer' program for Juicebox to scale their community-driven onboarding.\n\nWhat DAO Masters has done:\n\n- We’ve built out our own onboarding process with community members at DAO Masters, and refined it across three seasons. During this time, we’ve ensured that people feel engaged, are contributing meaningful work and making the most impact on the DAO.\n\nWe’ve also had some follow-up calls with fellow Juicebox core contributors to make sure we understand the major pain points for starting a Juicebox project, including:\n\n- Feb 4, 2022 meeting with 0xstvg to see what the project set-up looks like and hear most common questions asked by\n- Feb 23, 2022 meeting with JZ as he walked us through the common painpoints and three case studies he put together in his [user research](https://www.notion.so/User-Research-bf7320a4c49d4df3ac948057bb96253c)\n- Mar 4, 2022 meeting alongside 0xstvg and filipv as they onboard Studio Movie DAO to consider using Juicebox for treasury management\n\n### **What’s the range for the trial period?**\n\nWe expect the trial period to last 2 weeks. Angelaa and Julialipton will be the main point of contacts with an additional potential contributor. Communication can take place in the *“Juicebox Project Working Group”* channel in the DAO Masters server or via email or an alternative method proposed by the Juicebox team.\n\n### Deliverables\n\nBy the end of this trial period, we expect:\n\n- To have synthesized and summarized pain points that new contributors are facing, and top FAQs to address them basing it off some of JZ’s existing research\n- To write out 1 case study with a DAO that Juicebox thinks is best to highlight on their website for future usage: this will include a template of the configuration they used when deploying the project\n\n### **Payout Amount:**\n\n$600 USD paid in ETH\n\nIPFS \nhttps://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmRAJYWr5zpuCsLNHhHw8vzok3Pi25RNCgPKxuzgrzHkCg\n\nDiscord Discussion\nhttps://discord.com/channels/775859454780244028/873248745771372584/951938023791153222\n",

Transfer multisig ownership to those individuals, and update the multisig threshold to 9.\n\n## Motivation:\n\nIncreasing the size of the multisig not only further decentralizes Juicebox, but makes the multisig more impervious to individual bad actors and manipulation.\n\n## Risks:\n\n- All multisig-associated risks will be inherited by these new members.\n- Having a higher threshold and more multisig members may lead to coordination issues.\n- Configurations will have to be queued quickly to allow for signing.\n- New multisig members may not be as dedicated as existing members.\n\n## Specification:\n\nHold a weighted vote on the Juicebox Snapshot ([https://snapshot.org/#/jbdao.eth](https://snapshot.org/#/jbdao.eth)) with the following options:\n\n> No\nAbstain\nJango (jango.eth)\nPeri (peri.eth)\nMieos (mieos.eth)\nnervetrip (nervetrip.eth)\nZeugh (zeugh.eth)\ntwodam (twodam.eth)\naeolian (aeolian.eth)\njohnnyD (johnnyd.eth)\ndhyon (dhyon.eth)\nDrGorilla (drgorilla.eth)\nfilipv (0xDc6Dd6Bc601448541A4862a91De1B86291839651)\nAaron Wright (0x352e85EC1b6c1D422AD868A2b2f3151ED2B12D09)\nAustin Griffith (jbx.austingriffith.eth)\nScott Moore (0x24c34Ea514f7871a031F51f6e169D7b0795D8Cb0)\nJacob (jacob.eth)\nDennison (0xE8D848debB3A3e12AA815b15900c8E020B863F31)\nTyler Ward (tylerward.eth)\nPaul Berg (0xdb69537109999C0255cd431ceCFa31Ed807B5072)\nMark Yusko (markyusko.eth)\nAlok\ndefijesus (defijesus.eth)\nShegen (shegen.eth)\nSeanmc (0xc109636a2b47f8b290cc134dd446Fcd7d7e0cC94)\ntankbottoms (tankbottoms.eth)\njacopo (**jacopo.eth)**\n> \n\nAny vote other than a “no” or an “abstain” will be counted as a “yes” for standard governance purposes.\n\nIf this proposal passes, multisig ownership will be transferred to the 14 volunteers with the most JBX votes.\n\nIf the proposal passes and fewer than 14 volunteers have received JBX votes, only those who receive JBX votes will be added to the multisig.\n\nThe threshold will be set to the lowest possible number above (total multisig owner accounts * 0.6).\n\n## Rationale:\n\nA weighted vote allows for the multisig’s updated makeup to reflect the will of the community.\n\n## Copyright Disclaimer:\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n\nIPFS - https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmcPNn7oQqXE5ryLm9NAFNuNqqXhdcvPBhGPUTVy9uEPNe\n\nDiscord Discussion \nhttps://discord.com/channels/775859454780244028/873248745771372584/946451756999643176\nNotion Proposal\nhttps://www.notion.so/juicebox/Multisig-Expansion-7a241c816f8d472faea39f4728bd46e6\n\nChinese Translation\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1PHq1IbmB8FYf_1ew-cv6wDEBFdlIEbVUCuceRbcSAF8/edit?usp=sharing\n",

      "content": "## Summary:\n\nLower JuiceboxDAO membership fee from 5% to 2.5%.\n\n## Motivation:\n\nThe current protocol membership fee is 5%, meaning all projects need to pay 5% of withdrawn funds from their raises to the JuiceboxDAO treasury in return for newly minted JBX at the current issuance rate.\n\nThis proposal is to reduce the fee to 2.5%.\n\nThe reason for this change is for JuiceboxDAO to prioritize building an accessible network over accumulating membership fees. The DAO’s treasury is currently healthy and can support years of further protocol development within the current spending routine. Importantly, reducing fees reduces a barrier to entry for projects and gives them the choice to acquire additional JBX voluntarily. It also removes the tax for moving funds between Juicebox treasuries, which incur double fees (i.e. project A pays out project B (incurring a fee), which then pays out its contributors (incurring another fee on the same ETH). \n\nThe fee should not be 0. A non-zero fee continues to incentivize the JBX community to advocate for the growth of ecosystem projects, and serves as a spam filter. \n\nJuiceboxDAO will continue to hold the fee switch which is can use to increase fees up to 5% again in the future.\n\n## Risks:\n\nPotential reduction of membership growth.\n\nHigher fees might result in larger raises (perhaps eclipsing the cost of the fee) since current JBX members are highly incentivized to support.\n\n## Specification:\n\nMultisig sends a transaction to lower the fee to 2.5% on both TerminalV1 and TerminalV1.1. \nThis will affect all projects on the protocol who configure funding cycles after the change is made, including newly made projects.\n\n## Timeframe:\n\nThis will be done immediately after the snapshot proposal passes.\n\n## Copyright Disclaimer:\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n\nIPFS\nhttps://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmZFRuZNcrRwtDEHhZPCsnYpG1MkByvhHLBowYxeJcCTtk\n\nDiscord Discussion\nhttps://discord.com/channels/775859454780244028/873248745771372584/946469760978272378\n\nNotion Proposal\nhttps://www.notion.so/juicebox/Lower-protocol-fee-to-2-5-b6c89efdaece48f8923d5313e0872de6",

      "title": "JBP-114 - Juicebox Benefits Airdrop",
      "content": "```\nTitle: Juicebox Benefits Airdrop\nAuthor: filipv\nDate: 2022-02-23\n```\n\n## Thesis:\n\nDistribute 100,000,000 JBX from dao.jbx.eth to wallets which have been supporting Juicebox DAO.\n\n## Abstract:\n\n> [ARCx](https://arcx.money/) is a decentralized scoring protocol that powers on-chain identity and credit-score based borrowing.\n> \n\nThe ARCx team has built a Juicebox DAO Benefits score, which is based on governance participation and a JBX hodl score. The governance participation score is based on the number of Juicebox DAO snapshot votes which a wallet has participated in, and the hodl score is based on the total amount of time a wallet has held JBX. This proposal would allow wallets in various score ranges to claim different amounts of JBX, up to a maximum of 100,000,000 JBX.\n\n## Motivation:\n\n- FC#16 JBX distribution efforts failed to pass through Juicebox governance. This proposal aims to accomplish similar goals, but uses a richer dataset to establish distribution criteria.\n- Further distribution of JBX mitigates existential risks to Juicebox and the Juicebox ecosystem. The more decentralized JBX is, the more resilient the ecosystem is to individual bad actors or hostile takeovers.\n- Further JBX distribution will allow for governance to more closely reflect the views of the Juicebox community at large.\n- This distribution will reward governance participation and long-term commitments to Juicebox, which should both be encouraged.\n\n## Risks:\n\n- This proposal will dilute the voting power of JBX holders not on the list.\n- JBX should go to the hands of those who will utilize it to represent Juicebox’s long term interests. This proposal trusts that the criteria behind the Juicebox DAO Benefits score targets these individuals.\n\n## Specification:\n\nTake a snapshot of ARCx Juicebox DAO Benefits scores at Ethereum block 14263369.\n\n↓\n\nCreate an airdrop using [Astrodrop](https://www.astrodrop.xyz/)\n↓\n\nEvenly allocate a total of 16,666,667 JBX between wallets with scores above 300\nEvenly allocate a total of 33,333,333 JBX between wallets with scores from 201-300\nEvenly allocate a total of 50,000,000 JBX between wallets with scores from 53-200\n\n↓\n\nOnce the airdrop is created, create an announcement on the Juicebox DAO Discord server and on @juiceboxETH on Twitter, linking to the Astrodrop claiming page.\n\n## Rationale:\n\n- Using Astrodrop means this distribution can be deployed rapidly with relatively low effort.\n- The larger JBX totals for the lower score ranges offsets the high number of wallets within these ranges.\n- Distributing 100,000,000 JBX will have a significant impact, but still leaves ~160,000,000 JBX in the DAO’s reserve for future distributions.\n\n## Timeline:\n\nThis JBX should be claimable within 10 days of this proposal passing at most.\n\n## Copyright Disclaimer:\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n\nIPFS - https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmYW9XpFygSDA4qVYbcBYsLYXdFq5LnCwLxRYBkKKrueVA\n\nDiscord Discussion\nhttps://discord.com/channels/775859454780244028/873248745771372584/946531181082603562\n\nNotion Proposal\nhttps://www.notion.so/juicebox/Juicebox-Benefits-Airdrop-bee33f715788415d86a392c8e9f67657\n\nChinese Translation\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1gYKTUPoEXH4XKCrzeXZm4IOZsoGzGMSRaRvh4XgY0cw/edit?usp=sharing\n",

      "content": "### **Author:**\n\nZom_Bae\n\n### **Proposal date:**\n\nFebruary 24, 2022 \n\n### **Provide a comprehensive, 1-2 sentence summary of your proposal.**\n\nRenew and increase Zom_Bae’s payout to $3000/cycle for continued support to the DAO and be added to the JBX reserve list to receive an equal share of the 25% similar to other contributors. \n\n### **What role have you played in the community and what have you contributed thus far?**\n\nI believe I’ve adequately delivered on my role as outlined in my original proposal here: [https://juicebox.notion.site/Recurring-Payout-Pay-for-Project-Management-52c2b123373c44d9b85ae3a796159adf](https://www.notion.so/Recurring-Payout-Pay-for-Project-Management-52c2b123373c44d9b85ae3a796159adf) \n\nOther ways I’ve provided value in addition to, are as follows:\n\n- Adding general support when other mods/ contributors are offline\n- Spend time in all of the channels to help connect people & information (essentially an old school telephone operator. 😝)\n- Taking on the development and onboarding of DeWork and Otterspace Projects which will bring more efficiency to onboarding new members and task management (especially if we move forward with bounties via Dework).\n- Summarize and handoff town hall notes to Zhape to translate for the CN Community (he also sends me the CN summaries to post if Twodamn doesn’t be to it!)\n- Read, edit, provide feedback on contributor blog post, JB docs, and other documents in Notion/ Wiki, discord channel reorg, etc when needed.\n- Making sure JBDAO is a welcoming place, with good vibes, and people who give a shit. I deploy two primary methods. I acknowledge and reward by redistributing/ tipping JBX to folks doing great things. Making sure current contributors are activated and appreciated is key to retaining their effort. Second method is by helping set standards with the rest of the DAO to be thoughtful, transparent, project focused and by brining my own personality to the server.\n\n### **What role do you plan on playing in the community going forward?**\n\n- Outreach to newcomers and assisting with their onboarding into Juicebox and getting them setup to juice tasks. Ensuring they have the resources and relationships they need to build value with Juicebox\n- Manage tasks in Dework and assist in reviewing feedback from Otterspace (or whatever tooling we end up utilizing).\n- Continued support each focus group with task management by making sure tasks are being completed in timely manner and ensuring it's completed to the best of ones ability\n- Working with contributors to create long and short term plans that are achievable but will also create enough value to be worth creating a task for.  Setting targets for said plan to keep people moving forward\n- Help people bring the level of work and clarity of deliverables up to a high standard with a nurturing yet relentless tact. Helping set Juicy standards for the future health of the DAO.\n- Encourage a reasonable work/ life balance.  It's important that work gets done, but if I'll also be making sure members are taking care of their mental and physical health- so everyone can provide their best work while still living their best life\n- Bringing and cementing a space for all good and productive !vibes.\n\n### **How much do you want to earn? What else do you foresee needing from the community for you to do your best work?**\n\n$3000 per funding cycle and to be added to the reserve payout list along side the other contributors.\nI’m here to support and keep all DOA members, new & old, in the loop as best I can; all I ask is for the same in return. \n\n### **What does success look like for someone taking on your role?**\n\nA thriving protocol and sound contributor ecosystem.\n\nUltimately getting onboarding and task mgmt as autonomous as possible.    \n\n### **Under what criteria might it make sense for the community to reassess this payout allocation to you?**\n\nIf I no longer show up and things aren’t getting done.\n\n### **Sponsors:**\n\n@Zeugh @Jango\n\n\nIPFS\nhttps://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmdwdrhC7kkbwhX68W8yvLduRoJ4h3y42BKsEWzN87ydpr\n\nDiscord Discussion\nhttps://discord.com/channels/775859454780244028/873248745771372584/946740568405450803\n\nNotion Proposal\nhttps://www.notion.so/juicebox/Renew-recurring-payout-for-Zom_Bae-and-add-to-reserve-list-2f04d49f48184b488d86901fb66d8dbf\n\nChinese Translation\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1ywsH3X4ChTsxsmBJ6GeWmxOosb-O793vKrUTtEjQPuE/edit?usp=sharing\n",

      "title": "JBP-121 - Add Givewell to recurring payout",
      "content": "**Author:**\n\n@johnnyD \n\n## **Proposal date:**\n\nFebruary 23, 2022\n\n## Summary:\n\nAdd *[Givewell Maximum Impact Fund](https://www.givewell.org/charities/top-charities)* to a recurring payout of 10k USD per funding cycle. At our current funding target, given the best available evidence, this money would save approximately **3 human lives per funding cycle**. \n\n## Abstract:\n\n*Givewell* is a [research organisation](https://www.givewell.org/research) and is considered by many to be the world’s preeminent voice in how to give effectively. Their [*Maximum Impact Fund*](https://www.givewell.org/maximum-impact-fund) splits donations across *Givewell’s* [top charities](https://www.givewell.org/charities/top-charities). \n\n“We search for charities that **save or improve lives the most per dollar**. These are the best we’ve found. Supported by 20,000+ hours of research annually.” - *Givewell* on its top recommended charities.\n\n*Givewell* is endorsed by the likes of Sam Harris (who donates to *Givewell* a portion of the revenue of his company, *[Waking up](https://wakingup.com/foundation)),* Vitalik Buterin (who has donated [54M worth](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/8Ts7hA2jM6t9xNcmo/vitalik-buterin-just-donated-usd54m-in-eth-to-givewell) of ETH) and Sam Bankman-Fried (Founder/CEO of FTX which donates a [portion of its total fee revenue](https://coinjournal.net/news/the-ftx-foundation-is-launched-to-fund-charitable-causes/)).\n\n> GiveWell has filled a huge gap.\n> \n\n> When I speak about why we ought to be doing more to help the world's poorest people — something I do often — the most frequent question I get is: how can we know that our donation will really help the poor? Until *GiveWell* came along, it was difficult to give a convincing answer to that question. Previous charity-rating organizations just looked at how much of a charity's income went to program expenses, rather than administration - and it doesn't take much thought to realize that that figure tells you nothing about how effective the charity's programs are. GiveWell has filled a huge gap, and at the same time has started a major trend towards greater transparency and demonstrated cost-effectiveness in the charitable world.\n> \n> \n> ~ **Moral philosopher, [Peter Singer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Singer), on *Givewell***\n> \n\n## Motivation:\n\nEffectively donate a portion of Juicebox’s expenses to improving the state of the world. \n\n## Risks:\n\nThere is a small risk that *Givewell* could misuse the funds we send them. However, given *Givewell’s* stellar reputation, this is extremely unlikely. \n\n## Specification:\n\n### **Payout recipient:**\n\n0x7cF2eBb5Ca55A8bd671A020F8BDbAF07f60F26C1 \n\nTo verify address see [Givewell’s list of crypto wallets](https://www.givewell.org/about/donate/cryptocurrency). \n\n### **Payout amount:**\n\n10k per funding cycle \n\n### **Positive outcome:**\n\n*Givewell* estimates its [top charities](https://www.givewell.org/charities/top-charities) take between US$3000-4500 to save 1 human life, meaning **Juicebox would be saving approximately 3 lives per funding cycle** if this proposal is implemented.\n\n## Rationale:\n\n10k is a nice clean number. It would make up approximately 10% our new funding target (total payout expenses) -  a relatively minimal impact for us, but clearly a massive amount of good for the people who need help the most. \n\n## Timeframe:\n\nImplement for FC17. \n\n## Copyright Disclaimer:\n\n## **Sponsors:**\n\n[Zeugh](https://www.notion.so/Zeugh-d2e9734ddbfd432ea06098c264690162) \n\n@aeolian \n\n---\n\n**Note: recurring payout recipients are required to participate in votes for future payout allocations.

      "content": "```\nTitle: Update Proposal Templates\nAuthor: filipv\nDate: 2022-02-21\n```\n\n## Thesis:\n\nRemove all current proposal templates and introduce the format described in Proposal Template.md. \n\n[Proposal Template.md](https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmV2ePCxKZcA3ByjPRjCMfF4Tbtdsx8rW53ycZThBWzWYd)\n\n[Guide.md](https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmdVi6k8zkpkLw1epER2VRd8nxgGHFXoDf5jhtVjQtvEVL)\n\n## Motivation:\n\nThis proposal is part of a larger effort to standardize governance and make processes clearer in anticipation of v2.\n\n## Risks:\n\nAs always, process upgrades can lead to friction and confusion. The goal of this proposal is to make a template that can adapt as the needs of the community change over time, reducing the need for future changes.\n\nThis change will allow for far more flexibility in proposals, meaning proposals could omit important risks or relevant sections. It will be up to the Juicebox community to research and verify the consequences proposals may have.\n\n## Specification:\n\nRemove all current proposal templates. Introduce the format described in Proposal Template.md.\n\nDifferences between [General Proposal Template](https://www.notion.so/General-Proposal-Template-e20ece1e4f1949bfa79ed7cf589ace6a) and Proposal Template.md:\n\n- Important metadata is now included in the proposal body\n- *Summary* has been renamed to *Thesis*\n\nDifferences between [General Proposal Guide](https://www.notion.so/General-Proposal-Guide-3d81e6bb330a4c869bddd0d6449ac032) and Guide.md:\n\n- New guide is much more concise\n- Sections can be deleted/added as needed\n\n## Rationale:\n\nGovernance proposals can vary widely, and hyper-specific prompts often lead to a mismatch between information that voters should know about and information that ends up in a proposal. This specification would standardize prompts while also allowing for greater flexibility.\n\nThe introduction of metadata inside proposal bodies solves a few problems—proposal authors often run into issues with the Notion platform, making this format easier to work with. This also makes sure that relevant information stays within the markdown file, making it easier to mirror on IPFS and eventually migrate to another platform if necessary. This will also make governance facilitation smoother (no need for manual entry when moving proposals to snapshot).\n\nThis proposal will also indirectly remove “sponsors”. The sponsor section has led to misunderstandings, disagreements, and a good deal of confusion. People looking to endorse proposals can always do so in Discord discussion threads.\n\n## Timeline:\n\nThis proposal should go into effect as soon as possible once passed on Snapshot.\n\n## Copyright Disclaimer:\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n\n---\n\n[Discussion Thread](https://discord.com/channels/775859454780244028/873248745771372584/946457957091135508)｜[Temperature Check](https://discord.com/channels/775859454780244028/946457957091135508/946917710246314054)｜[IPFS](https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmarUCgNsAJ5HmDXD6bU4wgbH6xrhFHUYR3WCcMePt4ZJo)｜[Chinese Translation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FXCHeruvKPJdB_UA2kkFYqXRm1upSxg2bT4em3WmHOY/edit)\n\nChinese Translation\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1FXCHeruvKPJdB_UA2kkFYqXRm1upSxg2bT4em3WmHOY/edit",

Along with having more time to focus on Juicebox, a full-time commitment will allow for a new level of focus, dedication, and presence.\n\n## Motivation:\n\nThis increased payout reflects a greater commitment and an increase in effort and impact when compared to my original recurring payout proposal. My involvement across multiple DAO focus areas has enabled me to address unique issues, and I hope to develop this further during and after the transition to V2.\n\nMy [original recurring payout proposal](https://www.notion.so/Add-to-recurring-payout-a3e6de6c592f44f28026fc60055dca22) noted responsibilities in Governance, Visibility & materials, and Community alignment. I will continue with these commitments, and am looking to commit to the following projects:\n\n- Legal: Work with legal experts to mitigate risk to Juicebox DAO and groups throughout the Juicebox ecosystem.\n- Documentation: Create non-technical documentation, tutorials, and resources for V2.\n- Juicebox Ecosystem: Work directly with project creators to establish project configurations and governance processes. In the long term, develop templates and resources to scale this process.\n- Web3 Ecosystem: Work with groups across the larger web3 ecosystem to connect Juicebox to new infrastructure and develop Juicebox’s capabilities.\n- Mechanism: Contribute to research, planning, and implementation of projects related to Juicebox staking mechanisms and the JBX token.\n- Treasury Management: Contribute to research, planning, and implementation of treasury strategies which will mitigate risk and contribute to the Juicebox ecosystem.\n- Miscellaneous: Although difficult to capture in a proposal, a large portion of my work will likely not perfectly fit into one of these categories. As always, I plan to assist where needed to contribute to Juicebox DAOs long-term goals.\n\n## Risks:\n\nA payout of this size should be weighed seriously. One of Juicebox DAO’s greatest qualities is resourcefulness.\n\n## Specification:\n\nUpdate the Juicebox DAO Funding Distribution for filipv.eth to $8,000 per funding cycle.\n\n## Timeline:\n\nThis payout is to last from FC#17-FC#23 (inclusive).\n\n## Copyright Disclaimer:\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n\nIPFS \nhttps://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmPP1wDvnUw8cURaQBfn5MbA6jSTrHTbozm2dzjoBx2B6A\n\nDiscord Discussion\nhttps://discord.com/channels/775859454780244028/873248745771372584/946531489301033070\n\nNotion Proposal\nhttps://www.notion.so/juicebox/filipv-payout-update-e9e442b8c4fb48d68de6195c4d8b317e\n\nChinese Translation\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1CsZ2emc7HKjfUI2t3u_2RFsDJuYxB-eJ0lAx0gFtTM0/edit?usp=sharing\n",

Recurring payouts should be renewed/updated every 90 days.*\n\n### **Author:**\n\nZeugh\n\n### **Proposal date:**\n\nFebruary 22, 2022\n\n### Summary:\n\nThis proposal brings up to vote by the community the renewal of CanuDAO $8000/cycle payout for community management work, including discord server organization and maintenance, bots development and maintenance, support + onboarding and broader community tasks such as research on new community tools and best practices happening around the Web3 space.  \n\nThis payout includes Zeugh’s dedication as community manager to JBDAO and the support of the other CanuDAO members whenever extra hands are needed on the server, as well as the research and studies made in CanuDAO that are supported by those other members and serve as constant updates on the possible upgrades we can make.\n\n### Risks:\n\nCanuDAO is going through a big internal reorganization and in the following couple weeks some of this support may be unavailable in it’s full capacity, being mostly reliant on Zeugh for about the next 10-15 days.\n\n### **Payout recipient:**\n\ncanudao.eth\n\n### **Payout amount:**\n\n$8000\n\nThose are paid to CanuDAO and internally split between:\n- Zeugh\n- Members that directly support JB when needed\n- bot devs\n- Researchers on community\n- canudao treasury on juicebox.money, owned by CND holders\n\n### **How have you contributed to the DAO?**\n\nSince the last payout approval, that can be found here: [https://www.notion.so/juicebox/Canu-s-Payment-Increase-013deb1b0f8e4f8ea79d65e211668ed7](https://www.notion.so/Canu-s-Payment-Increase-013deb1b0f8e4f8ea79d65e211668ed7), \nZeugh and CanuDAO have:\n- Organized and engaged in CanuDAO research about: improving multi-language communities, rewarding members and creating minimal communities to help new projects start\n- Onboarded lots of new project creators and provided support to new members\n- Reorganized the discord server to optimize new contributor and new member experience\n- Researched, contacted and tested new tools to improve our task management and oboarding processes\n- Reached out to developers to build a new proposal creation tool that is under development in it’s late stage and should be ready for use in the next couple of cycles\n- Generally supported diverse need of the community in all kinds of areas \n- Hosted twitter spaces with new projects to help new juiceboxes get visibility and give their members clarity on the configurations of their projects\n- Helped new projects manage their own communities in the JB ecosystem\n\n### How do you want to contribute to the DAO going forward**?**\n\nZeugh will be:\n- Keeping the discord structure updated with new tools that are constantly coming out\n- Provide support for new members and new projects\n- Help integrated different project in the ecosystem \n- Provide support to the integration of new partners given the possibility of extensions in the new V2 of the protocol (like OlympusDAO who is already in touch with us)\n- Further the research on tools for DAOs to optimize our internal processes\n- Use my (rather small) social media presence to  keep up the twitter spaces with new projects\n- Help new projects with the basics for their communities\n- Starting a podcast with other tool builders to incentivise the creation and propagation of new tools for DAOs that may come in handy for projects in the ecosystem and JBDAO itself\n\nCanuDAO will be:\n- Improving it’s business model and internal structure to provide better community management to new projects\n- Finishing it’s community starter package to make it easier for JB projects to more easily launch a community after their project is created\n- Researching on community management to improve the service we provide \n\n### **What does success look like for someone taking on your role?**\n\nA growing community, with a good environment for building and supporting new builders to get easy access to the resources they need. A more intertwined ecosystem around the juicebox protocol\n\n### **Under what criteria should the community reassess this payout?**\n\n- This payment should be redistributed if CanuDAO dissolves\n- This payment should be reduced or canceled if we stop delivering support to the community\n- This payment should be canceled if our actions intentionally put the community at risk\n- This payment should be increased if demand grows and we have to bring more hands onboard\n\n### **Sponsors:**\n\n[Zeugh](https://www.notion.so/Zeugh-d2e9734ddbfd432ea06098c264690162) [Zom_bae](https://www.notion.so/Zom_bae-7cbb9ce30379449faf73357acb5256b4) \n\n---\n\nIPFS\nhttps://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmSgA1UbasPGotwBZdZnJWKfECsoQHWu6spNUnoZoLscs3\n\nDiscord Discussion\nhttps://discord.com/channels/775859454780244028/873248745771372584/945862724976521256\n\nNotion Proposal\nhttps://www.notion.so/juicebox/Zeugh-CanuDAO-reccuring-payout-update-0ad4fe4a79a046488ccc4385ce1e5a4d\n\nChinese Translation\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/18Zfg0jE0UHX0IAv0J2OeKSFmkY_S0Biha7pUYC19ujk/edit?usp=sharing\n",

      "content": "\n*After a trial period of 1-3 cycles, contributors are encouraged to propose a recurring role for themselves. Recurring payouts should be renewed/updated every 90 days.*\n\n### **Author:**\n\n@Dr Gorilla \n\n### **Proposal date:**\n\nFebruary 25, 2022\n\n### Summary:\n\nRenew the 90-days recurring payout of DrGorilla.eth (contract engineer), from FC#17 to FC#23 included (90 days)\n\n### Risks:\n\nLack/absence of productivity\n\n### **Payout recipient:**\n\ndrgorilla.eth\n\n### **Payout amount:**\n\n9694.20\n\n### **How have you contributed to the DAO?**\n\n- Some highlights:\n    - Found & suggested fix for critical vulnerability in the V1 the rescue terminal (a reentrancy that might have allowed a bad project owner to drain the whole contract balance).\n    - Found & suggested fix for a critical overflow allowance issue in V2 (a missing assertion that might have allowed someone with an allowance to empty the whole treasury of the related project).\n- Currently 3 work in progress (unit test of ballot using Foundry, allowance fix & fee precision adjustment), 3 open PR and 19 merged ([https://github.com/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Adrgorillamd+archived%3Afalse+is%3Aclosed+user%3Ajbx-protocol](https://github.com/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Adrgorillamd+archived%3Afalse+is%3Aclosed+user%3Ajbx-protocol)). Those were mostly tests (unit and system tests) and bug fixes.\n- While the proposal doesn’t target it, I’ve started and push for the launch of Moody’sDAO (providing clear and concise information about projects living on Juicebox, to our community, to give them food for thought in terms of investment decisions) - [https://twitter.com/MoodySdao](https://twitter.com/MoodySdao)\n- Consistently shitposting against the BSC Scam which popped up recently. Hopefully, some people saved their money after seeing a tweet/telegram/discord post message.\n\n### How do you want to contribute to the DAO going forward**?**\n\nPursuing my role as a contract engineer, including but not limited to:\n\n- Pursuing V2 launch effort:\n    - implementing audits finding patches\n    - finish system test & fix what’s needing a fix\n    - depending on audit’s timeline and potential (unforeseen) delay, deployment of V2 🥳\n- Post-V2 launch:\n    - Insure new project contract support → hopefully, there will be a need for custom solutions (custom terminal, “mint a NFT when paying”, etc) - fun things\n    - Insure support for our L2 think-thank and deploy accordingly\n    - Insure support for the contract-side of the force, to the dao and to the end-users\n\nFind other spots where our community might have an unmet need and DAOify them.\n\nContinuously find situational gif-gems & shit post accordingly.\n\n### **What does success look like for someone taking on your role?**\n\nSleepless nights and flawless code.\n\n### **Under what criteria should the community reassess this payout?**\n\nNumber of significant improvement to the Juicebox codebase or projects revolving around Juicebox codebase \n\n### **Sponsors:**\n\n*Community members who agree to act as spokespeople for this proposal can add themselves here.*\n\n---\n\n**Note: recurring payout recipients are required to participate in votes for future payout allocations. For payouts to non-EOAs, attach an address that will manage voting on the non-EOA address's behalf.**\n\n\nIPFS\nhttps://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmaBjobPBCYghcq1ieSemdG2uLQMkZe2wqEEQ2CcJ65Xnv\n\nDiscord Discussion\nhttps://discord.com/channels/775859454780244028/873248745771372584/946712791434281020\n\nNotion Proposal\nhttps://www.notion.so/juicebox/Renew-update-DrGorilla-eth-recurring-payout-e6186d6cd8c34eee9577a885932aa995\n\nChinese Translation\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1V6u4Jg_IFCYLQ8N6dOYXcIvhEo93ZEPOdJ7d_hdlaak/edit?usp=sharing\n",

      "content": "\n*References to “Juicebox multisig” or “multisig” in this proposal refer to the Gnosis Safe wallet on the Ethereum mainnet at 0xAF28bcB48C40dBC86f52D459A6562F658fc94B1e.*\n\n*References to “threshold” or “multisig threshold” in this proposal refer to the number of owner accounts needed to confirm a Gnosis Safe transaction before it can be executed.*\n\n*References to “governance process” or “Juicebox governance process” in this proposal refer to the processes by which Juicebox DAO is governed, and any future amendments to those processes. The current iteration of these processes are described at [https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/Qmc6QqbnMm2hVobU12x11aigHYdzcYGhho7pH8Xz3TrrW2?preview=1](https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/Qmc6QqbnMm2hVobU12x11aigHYdzcYGhho7pH8Xz3TrrW2?preview=1).*\n\n*References to “members” of the multisig in this proposal refer to Gnosis owner accounts of the Juicebox multisig.*\n\n## Summary:\n\nThis proposal formally defines the expectations and responsibilities of Juicebox multisig members.\n\n## Specification:\n\nImplement the following rules:\n\n1. The Juicebox multisig and Juicebox multisig owner accounts must agree to execute the will of JBX token holders, as expressed through the Juicebox Governance Process.\n2. The Juicebox multisig threshold must be set to the lowest possible number such that the threshold is above 60% of the number of Juicebox multisig owner accounts.\n3. If there are more than five owner accounts of the Juicebox multisig, Juicebox multisig owner accounts can be removed from the multisig at request of the owner accounts which would be removed. Otherwise, all Juicebox multisig wallet actions must be explicitly approved by JBX token holders through the Juicebox Governance Process, or follow the Emergency Governance Process.\n\nExisting multisig members must agree to these principles, and prospective multisig members must agree to these principles before being added to the multisig. Violators will be immediately removed from the multisig if there are more than five multisig owner accounts. Otherwise, the multisig member will be removed once a suitable replacement has been found, in no more than 7 days.\n\n## Risks:\n\n1. Putting control of the multisig fully in the hands of JBX holders exposes the DAO to risk if JBX goes into the wrong hands.\n2. Increasing the multisig threshold may impede progress. In a situation where the DAO needs to act quickly (such as a breach of security), having a high threshold could be disastrous.\n3. If Juicebox DAO needs to act quickly in an emergency, explicit governance approval may be impractical. The Emergency Governance Process should be improved over coming funding cycles to mitigate this risk.\n4. In a situation where a suitable multisig replacement could not be found within 7 days of a removal, trust in Juicebox would be severely undermined.\n\n## Rationale:\n\nThese principles are intended as general guidelines that formalize existing processes while being flexible enough to adapt as Juicebox changes over time. This proposal will need to be overwritten in the event that Juicebox DAO moves to onchain governance, or if the governance process changes dramatically.\n\n## Timeframe:\n\nThese rules shall be implemented immediately and will apply indefinitely.\n\n## Copyright Disclaimer:\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n\nIPFS\nhttps://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmcMtevwQGHcdj4wLSkbfHvkZi8ZpyZ4Zzt4fG3ypZVFhB\n\nDiscord Discussion\nhttps://discord.com/channels/775859454780244028/873248745771372584/941836285260230726\n\nNotion Proposal\nhttps://www.notion.so/juicebox/Ratify-Multisig-Process-aeaf471268434a89ad3a4dc2b3fe6e4e\n",

      "title": "JBP-105 - Increase JBX Bonding Curve to 95%",
      "content": "### **Author:**\n\n@Mr. Goldstein @V J \n\n### **Proposal date:**\n\nFebruary 3, 2022\n\n### Summary:\n\n- Since the inception of JBX, the bonding curve helped retain and reward long term stakeholders in the community while providing DAO members the ability to redeem their ETH contributions with an elegant exit option.\n- This feature is highly valued by the community. Something that can be seen through the ~50 ETH redemptions occurring since the bonding curve was updated to 70% in FC 12 vs. total redemptions of ~50 ETH between FC 1 and FC 11.\n- The existing JBXDAO treasury of ~5K ETH is extremely healthy. It gives the JBXDAO both a decade of operating capital (assuming $1.5 annual burn rate and no revenue) and allows it to explore additional flexibility with the bonding curve.\n- Updating the bonding curve to 95% will further incentivize short term members to redeem some of their initial contributions, while retaining ample operating capital for the DAO.\n\n### Motivation:\n\n- Stakeholder alignment - incentivizing DAO members to redeem ETH for their JBX through the JBXDAO (vs. AMM) focuses the narrative on long term stakeholder alignment\n- Increasing flexibility - providing the existing user base with the mechanism flexibility that has been successfully utilized by the community\n- Strengthening the JBX ecosystem - increasing the relative strength of the ecosystem by reducing the overall tokens in circulation and increasing the Treasury / JBX ratio\n\n### Risks:\n\n- Unexpectedly high redemption rates can significantly decrease JBXDAO overall treasury thus shortening the operational runway of the DAO and any flexibility the DAO might have with capital deployment towards yield generation or grants programs.\n- Mitigants:\n    - JBX will continue to generate more revenue to cover costs and accrue value to the treasury (did $420K of fees in January)\n    - JBX will continue to raise more funding in future funding cycles at 6x the redemption price\n\n### **What changes should be made to the redemption rate bonding curve?**\n\nBonding curve to 95%.\n\n### Rationale:\n\nUpdating the rate to a relatively high number of 95%, but still leaving another leg of update if needed.\n\n### **Sponsors:**\n\n*Community members who agree to act as spokespeople for this proposal can add themselves here.*\n\nIPFS\nhttps://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmNoBYFEQQUnvNkPjsqZzz3ENrpcS6Y7hcMxstqmkHg4Ux\n\nDiscord Discussion\nhttps://discord.com/channels/775859454780244028/873248745771372584/941840051464200213\n\nNotion Proposal\nhttps://www.notion.so/juicebox/Increase-JBX-Bonding-Curve-to-95-039166a8ae844951a233c90ce0cda107\n",

The more decentralized JBX is, the more resilient the ecosystem is to individual bad actors or hostile takeovers.\n- Further JBX distribution will allow for governance to more closely reflect the views of the Juicebox community at large.\n- Holding JBX is one of the most direct representations of Juicebox ecosystem membership. This distribution will reward many who have contributed to Juicebox and have not been recognized in other ways.\n\n## Risks:\n\n- In general, this proposal amplifies the relative voting power of wallets with less JBX, and diminishes the relative voting power of wallets with more JBX. Wallets with more JBX have a greater vested interest in Juicebox, and reducing their relative voting power could negatively impact governance outcomes.\n- Many of these wallets are likely inactive, meaning the JBX will not be put to use.\n\n## Specification:\n\nUse [disperse.app](http://disperse.app) to send 32,206 JBX to all 3105 wallets which held 10,000 or more JBX as of Ethereum block 14,128,906. A full list of JBX holders and balances at block 14,128,906 can be found [here](https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmRTDp5ubX3v67K97cKvtvu6mjgDZbbssesxArS7DppFi4?preview=1), and a list of all qualifying wallet addresses can be found [here](https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmYu1AUfiBXL3hA1PB1PppvKZXRbfL5NsYAjQ8PHM7iCLr?preview=1).\n\n## Rationale:\n\n- A snapshot and a 10,000 JBX minimum will prevent most sybil attacks.\n- [disperse.app](http://disperse.app) dramatically reduces gas fees for a transaction of this nature.\n- Although the total amount of JBX distributed is extremely high, the amount per wallet is moderate. This will have a decentralizing effect on the JBX token and Juicebox governance.\n\n## Timeframe:\n\nThis JBX will be distributed immediately, and only once.\n\n## Copyright Disclaimer:\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n\n\nIPFS \nhttps://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/Qmc8QUjR9wYmK8swzRUwsEndej3TghgupJBw8mhovLEjBU\n\nDiscord Discussion\nhttps://discord.com/channels/775859454780244028/873248745771372584/941838562968617001\n\nNotion Proposal\nhttps://www.notion.so/juicebox/Distribute-JBX-to-JBX-Holders-bb18656810da4494adadac5e7d1a5c60\n",

People might get scammed, websites might break, and rugs might be pulled.\n\n2. JBX distribution is still tied to the multisig. Until a move to onchain governance, this system will inherit all the risks of Juicebox governance in general.\n\n## **Specification:**\n\nAllocate 10% of new JBX reserved for dao.jbx.eth to Juicebox frontends each funding cycle.\n\nTo claim this JBX, any interested frontend must implement a tag. The tag should be prepended to any memo text entered by a contributor, with the format `&X&text`, where **text** is the contributor input and **x** is a hexadecimal representation of a Juicebox project ID. Frontends should also filter out this tag when displaying contribution memos.\n\nEach funding cycle, distribute this JBX allocation to Juicebox projects listed in these tags, in direct proportion with the associated volume (measured in ETH).\n\n## **Rationale:**\n\n1. This tagging system is compact, and using the memo field will allow for very quick deployment. This system also means that these frontends must themselves be Juicebox projects.\n\n2. Reserved JBX is tied to total protocol volume, aligning incentives—this will encourage the growth of the Juicebox ecosystem.\n\n## **Timeframe:**\n\nThe JBX reserve for frontends should be re-evaluated in FC#20, and be increased if there is more frontend competition.\n\n## **Copyright Disclaimer:**\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n\nIPFS \nhttps://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/Qmdbf6EyTtJqisU4o4GeCp9gEN3KY5dHRR37Ff3UmRLVg5\n\nDiscord Discussion\nhttps://discord.com/channels/775859454780244028/873248745771372584/941839642154647662\n\nNotion Proposal\nhttps://www.notion.so/juicebox/Incentivize-Frontend-Decentralization-e0c8d9c0066540b296c3e334799e5119\n",

      "title": "JBP-99 - Distribute JBX to Extended Community",
      "content": "## Summary:\n\nEvenly distribute a total of ~10,000,000 JBX from dao.jbx.eth (ETH: 0xaf28bcb48c40dbc86f52d459a6562f658fc94b1e) to the 66 wallets that have received JBX as part of the *[JBX Distribution Program](https://dune.xyz/twodam/JuiceboxDAO-JBX-Distribution-Program)* established by JBP-54 as of February 3rd 2022 at 15:41 UTC.\n\n## Motivation:\n\n- Further distribution of JBX mitigates existential risks to Juicebox and the Juicebox ecosystem. The more decentralized JBX is, the more resilient the ecosystem is to individual bad actors or hostile takeovers.\n- Further JBX distribution will allow for governance to more closely reflect the views of the Juicebox community at large.\n- Distributing to wallets that received JBX as a part of the initial JBX distribution allows for an even larger network effect—recipients that choose to distribute further will bring new people into the Juicebox ecosystem.\n\n## Risks:\n\n- This proposal will dilute the voting power of JBX holders not on the list.\n- It is likely that many of the wallets that will receive JBX as a result of this proposal will not distribute that JBX any further without an enforcement mechanism. This risk is mitigated by the relatively low JBX per wallet (~185,000 JBX). If these wallets choose not to distribute further, this still accomplishes the further decentralization of JBX.\n\n## Specification:\n\nUse [disperse.app](http://disperse.app) to send 151,515 JBX to each of the following wallet addresses (taken from @twodam’s [Dune query](https://dune.xyz/queries/340256/654726)):\n\n0x90eda5165e5e1633e0bdb6307cdecae564b10ff7\n0x6860f1a0cf179ed93abd3739c7f6c8961a4eea3c\n0xf2cc5ab715d7f0c98bb49606ef8270e00180c98e\n0x48598ff1cee7b4d31f8f9050c2bbae98e17e6b17\n0x28c173b8f20488eef1b0f48df8453a2f59c38337\n0x30670d81e487c80b9edc54370e6eaf943b6eab39\n0x2dda8dc2f67f1eb94b250caefac9de16f70c5a51\n0xe16a238d207b9ac8b419c7a866b0de013c73357b\n0xf5aa24cc247ac13486bf3ae9346776bab439b31d\n0xca6ed3fdc8162304d7f1fcfc9ca3a81632d5e5b0\n0x34724d71ce674fcd4d06e60dd1baa88c14d36b75\n0xd209390a0b04f03507614fc07f9359e831911677\n0xf0fe43a75ff248fd2e75d33fa1ebde71c6d1abad\n0x282947b894bab892119d9a3445f3ddfe4f2ec14c\n0x5706d5ad7a68bf8692bd341234be44ca7bf2f654\n0xa0d1a6f30db260e4d67fe20449a23e7b89537a1b\n0xf4844a06d4f995c4c03195afcb5aa59dcbb5b4fc\n0x9df0a751bae1cfce9bbb8a3f318853d8132c0fc6\n0x665607ebede5cd4efdb4e1b4d92a4f13d50ff029\n0x1ae766cc5947e1e4c3538ee1f3f47063d2b40e79\n0xecd8bba75f11406b2c46b021f13a5b451cfc1591\n0xdb08edbcf449de2a2b27448a8040935802c621f1\n0x111040f27f05e2017e32b9ac6d1e9593e4e19a2a\n0xc29c546064e8fb5506c5e5beaf1594866df7177e\n0x9f12d6319fdc6654038e690441d3ecf8608270f1\n0xd118c9ec2b6d433d0559534b831b5b3fd322f5de\n0xa508c16666c5b8981fa46eb32784fccc01942a71\n0x60535a6605958fff6cec5b1e92892601efb3473b\n0xf8284136b169213e4c50ce09f3e1d9a9b484baea\n0x6691af446bb121b19aec9c0ff6ed9c4721d5fee1\n0x34aaa3d5a73d6f9594326d0422ce69748f09b14f\n0x16bdbd83a85fb2d8c62f5bf4895f7f6adbb22c6e\n0xd551b861414b7a2836e4b4615b8155c4b1ecc067\n0xfb9979cb3c0c276be52ad261eb9b9a9f7de42dc2\n0x79ccdae089b8a9f5ecd13b88392f323cabb7d7bf\n0x6212ce06dcac01706e6be5310c3228ede1a02adf\n0xd0b7dd30a212fa358a6a837df89f3c8f0d649319\n0xa934b56be3ec0bddfa8bfd1cb141e66d1bbd0f69\n0xf2829e74c8a8709e170e21979a482f88c607b632\n0xd30a79e487351eb0064c8a78eb341da364d78a9a\n0x24bcee8ddc8c6ccdba6fe0976977730a19147931\n0xbc74cc61c131205e1d71db1854bf25c83c0355e8\n0x51448923d8a215a5a8cd872a51f22c2f5c43b444\n0xee0872ec2c8ed771cb1c406a37b02458ad4c28f0\n0xc109636a2b47f8b290cc134dd446fcd7d7e0cc94\n0x3b3525f60eeea4a1ef554df5425912c2a532875d\n0xdd3767abcab26f261e2508a1da1914053c7dda78\n0x89da9eb32da60fd8ebde09824cf8b0eec66c8d40\n0x35bbf64e77be6a966449e76570f1f8d757816802\n0xf33364a83b6002d5070ec5fa31f5d9eb93572732\n0xa9903bda477b9a57bd795adff9922cb98db65f04\n0xbb8fc4772ac3892e19963f31794c482382e9675d\n0x48a63097e1ac123b1f5a8bbffafa4afa8192fab0\n0x4b72aa21820c76e1e19193d90bdb9b5f25f8aa19\n0xe2a8d5aa38f5c05dff59da89462a012131ba5e24\n0x78789651b58179b2d90af90c8e5b4f5e4a4182ce\n0x7d0068d0d8fc2aa15d897448b348fa9b30f6d4c9\n0x369b0d048f08b8ecf113dcff5d00667acb8e3462\n0xea4a4a886aca47dd0167b4aee5b1345e18d20ee5\n0x09e1ac8489c9fd339eaefdc5ce8651ee22cdb7fc\n0x2c7eaa84fc7b41fa96dfcb7aa7fe87a5eaab2567\n0x6c6541cc3ec6bfc2d7b0ca48ccb0225cbbea9b59\n0xf8b57e5ed505bc6faffc765c1ac8569063664c38\n0x911413ef4127910d79303483f7470d095f399ca9\n0xf8932eab6698b303d2146bd0d0502389c0a0ff07\n0x93c17b539ac29c54f42a73aef3c0cd78b3fafd06\n\n## Rationale:\n\nUsing [disperse.app](http://disperse.app) mitigates gas fees, and using a snapshot prevents sybil attacks.\n\n## Timeframe:\n\nThis JBX will be distributed immediately, and only once.\n\n## Copyright Disclaimer:\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n\nIPFS \nhttps://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmVB7fgnCJkpNxFFaqB6g5JdTvHin2KDy9i2p1AXmV64CT\n\nDiscord Discussion\nhttps://discord.com/channels/775859454780244028/873248745771372584/941837278165237780\n\nNotion Proposal\nhttps://www.notion.so/juicebox/Distribute-JBX-to-Extended-Community-88c11f3f6d6345598bb63fd360866225\n",

      "content": "*Contributors with significant responsibilities within Juicebox DAO are encouraged to create a reserved JBX allocation proposal.*\n\n### **Author:**\n\n@johnnyD \n\n### **Proposal date:**\n\nFebruary 9, 2022\n\n### **Summary:**\n\nI propose to be added to the reserved rate and receive the same share as the 11 entities currently on the list, bringing each entity’s reserved allocation to 2.08% (25/12). \n\n### Risks:\n\nAs with any long-term contributor commitment, the risk is in the contributor reneging on their responsibilities and failing to maintain a high work output. \n\n### **Proposed reserved JBX allocation:**\n\nAn equal share of the 25% reserved for individual entities, so 2.08%. \n\n### How **have you contributed to the DAO?**\n\nMy list of 52 merged PR’s can be found [here](https://github.com/jbx-protocol/juice-interface/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Ajohnnyd-eth+is%3Aclosed+). I have designed and implemented various features to JB’s frontend and been quick to fix many bugs (see PR’s labeled ‘[BUG]’). \n\n### Recent:\n\n- Implement Trending projects sections on homepage. Redesign `/#/projects` page to include ‘Trending’, ‘Holdings’ and ‘All’ tabs, and added a new filter. https://github.com/jbx-protocol/juice-interface/pull/455\n- Design and implement a new ‘Review and Deploy’ modal after project creation https://github.com/jbx-protocol/juice-interface/pull/465\n- Improve ‘Burn token’ flow for when project overflow is 0 (e.g. Assange) https://github.com/jbx-protocol/juice-interface/pull/464\n\n### Translations:\n\n- I set up and implemented Crowdin to Juicebox, which has massively increased the efficiency in adding translations to the JB site - 5 languages added already with many more on the way.\n- Designed and implemented the language selector (‣).\n\n### Older UI changes:\n\n- Redesigned and implemented a new top nav for desktop (‣) and mobile (‣).\n- Add validations to all JB’s forms [Optimize the app's use of reactive forms/](https://www.notion.so/Optimize-the-app-s-use-of-reactive-forms-626b1ff4e1864d55973c6fe37930877a)\n- Added $ value input on distribution forms (https://github.com/jbx-protocol/juice-interface/pull/313).\n- Added ‘funding target after JB fee’ input on project creation and reconfig (‣).\n- Design and implement a ‘Copy to Clipboard’ icon for ETH addresses (‣)\n- Implement button to link feedback form (https://github.com/jbx-protocol/juice-interface/pull/370)\n- Can check out the rest of my smaller features and bug fixes in my [list of merged PR’s](https://github.com/jbx-protocol/juice-interface/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Ajohnnyd-eth+is%3Aclosed+).\n\n### How do you want to contribute to the DAO going forward**?**\n\n**In the short/medium term:**\n\n- Continue to design and implement new features.\n- Continue to remain on standby for any bugs that need quick fixing.\n- I will play a key role in implementing new interfaces for V2 contracts.\n- Continue to participate fully in JB governance.\n\n**Long term:**\n\n- Implement a Juicebox SDK library.\n- Implement custom interfaces for Juicebox projects.\n\n### **What do you need from the community to accomplish these goals?**\n\nContinued amazing work and support from the Peel and Juicebox contributor team. Clear communication and critiques around new features and bugs from the Juicebox community. \n\n### **What does success look like for someone taking on your role?**\n\nFacilitating a continually improving Juicebox user experience. \n\n### **Under what criteria should the community reassess this allocation?**\n\nIf I renege on my commitments, fail to maintain a high work output.  \n\nThank you for taking the time to read my proposal 🙌\n\n### **Sponsors:**\n\n*Community members who agree to act as spokespeople for this proposal can add themselves here.*\n\n---\n\n**Note: reserved JBX allocation recipients are required to participate in votes for future reserved JBX allocations.

      "content": "## Summary:\n\n- **Create a Frontend DAO (”Peel DAO”)** comprising of the JB’s frontend contributors to internally handle frontend matters of Juicebox. Peel DAO would be created as a Juicebox project.\n- Add Peel DAO to a recurring payout of US$30,000 (paid in ETH) per funding cycle.\n- Remove recurring payouts for frontend contributors @peri @aeolian and @johnnyD\n- Send 3.98566618 ETH to frontend multisig (address TBD). This is the ETH remaining from the previous allocation to JB multisig for infrastructure spending.[https://snapshot.org/#/jbdao.eth/proposal/0xc1fba48670c743dcd4773b5def0b0e9d4102430aad1f19af0c16cbce4e23b51c](https://snapshot.org/#/jbdao.eth/proposal/0xc1fba48670c743dcd4773b5def0b0e9d4102430aad1f19af0c16cbce4e23b51c), after single purchase of USDC to pay Infura billing [https://etherscan.io/address/0x68b3465833fb72A70ecDF485E0e4C7bD8665Fc45](https://etherscan.io/address/0x68b3465833fb72A70ecDF485E0e4C7bD8665Fc45).\n- Send US$2,035.00 in ETH for 13-month Crowdin bill already paid by @johnnyD.\n\n## Abstract:\n\nThe frontend contributors are proposing to break into their own DAO (Peel DAO) to internally handle frontend matters of Juicebox and Juicebox projects. \n\n## Motivation:\n\n1. **Less complexity for Juicebox DAO.** The responsibility to be familiar with individual contributions would be moved from Juicebox DAO to Peel DAO, removing some burden from Juicebox DAO voters. Juicebox DAO would only be responsible for considering proposals from the Peel DAO as a whole, rather than from individual contributors.\n2. **More agility for the frontend team.** Without requiring new or existing members to go through the Juicebox DAO governance process, the frontend team would be able to onboard new members or adapt to changes in member roles more quickly. This would be especially useful for incentivizing folks to help out who may only be interested in short-term contributions, and for whom a 2-3 week proposal timeline may be a friction point.\n3. **Easier to provide services to Juicebox projects**. This proposal will enable JB projects to approach the Peel DAO directly for frontend work, such as customizing their project’s [juicebox.money](http://juicebox.money) page or JB integrations outside of [juicebox.money](http://juicebox.money), rather than the current much higher friction option of going through Juicebox DAO. \n\n## Risks:\n\nThe control of JB’s frontend matters, such as hiring frontend contributors, would be moved from the JB DAO to the Peel DAO. Over the short term, frontend decisions could be made by Peel DAO that the JB DAO disagrees with. However, it should be noted that if the Peel DAO consistently proves to be misaligned with Juicebox DAO, Juicebox DAO could easily propose to reduce or remove Peel DAO’s funding. \n\n## Specifications:\n\nThe Peel DAO will be owned by a multisig wallet comprising of the current frontend contributors: @peri @aeolian @Torvus Bug @Zhou Jason and @johnnyD. The governance process will be managed through this multisig, on a simple majority-vote basis (proposals will require 3/5 signatures to pass). \n\n### Responsibilities:\n\nThe Peel DAO would take on the combined responsibilities of all the frontend contributors, including:\n\n- Maintaining any and all frontend-related work on juicebox.money, [rinkeby.juicebox.money](http://rinkeby.juicebox.money), and all related Juicebox interfaces.\n- Design & implement a frontend experience based on changes to the JB protocol (such as V2).\n- Research & deliver customer insights.\n- Manage [juicebox.money](http://juicebox.money) domain.\n\n### Funding distribution:\n\nWe propose that the Peel DAO receive a recurring payout of US$30,000 USD (paid in ETH) per funding cycle. We propose that the current recurring frontend contributors’ payouts (@peri, @aeolian and @johnnyD) be removed.\n\n### Reserved tokens:\n\nWe propose current frontend contributor @peri be removed from the Juicebox DAO reserved token list.\n\n## Rationale\n\nThe US$30,000 USD in ETH per FC will fund:\n\n- Sum of current frontend contributor’s recurring payouts (currently US$15,900).\n- Addition of designer @Zhou Jason to a recurring payout.\n- 50% extra to fund essential but less frequent contributions from devs such as @Torvus Bug, as well as prepare for a case where new contributors need to be brought on immediately.\n- Infrastructure spending\n    - Infura - variable (US$500-3000 per month estimate)\n    - Blocknative - US$375 per month\n    - Crowdin - US$170 per month\n    - Graph queries -\n- Accounting for infrastructure costs that result from unexpected, extreme spikes in traffic. We estimate that a significant increase in traffic at the level we saw when ConstitutionDAO went viral could cost upwards of US$10,000-15,000 per month.\n\n## Timeframe:\n\nWe propose that these changes be implemented immediately. \n\n## Copyright Disclaimer:\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n\nIPFS\nhttps://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmYF3VHirQBLTdBxjxzuu1xVnzxVGQmdH4nzK1azT7SBuR?preview=1\n\nDiscord Discussion\nhttps://discord.com/channels/775859454780244028/873248745771372584/935748917889466398\n\nNotion Proposal\nhttps://www.notion.so/juicebox/Create-and-fund-a-JB-Frontend-DAO-27cee85342c640cfa3e55ccfb0d828ad\n",

Or receive tokens via airdrops. \n\nThe inflow of payments in ETH won’t be rewarded with JBX which can deter more donations to the reserve of the DAO.\n\n**This change cannot be reversed, unless protocol is changed.**\n\n## Specification:\n\nThe platform should lock in the additional issuances to capture the value, and the market value discovery function should be activated. \n\nTotal locked value of Juicebox are now far exceeds the market value of the JBX, and there is a continuous donation window (actually no one donates, the current donation ratio is 1ETH: 117155JBX, and the transaction price is 1ETH: 420000JBX), which is a value inversion. \n\nThe value lock of the JBX platform is reflected by locking the unlimited additional issuance window. \n\nNow JBX has raised 5823ETH worth more than 18 million US dollars (this exceeds the current market value of JBX tokens of 1500 US dollars), JBXDAO 180 million JBX tokens.\n\n## Rationale:\n\nThe token model with unlimited supply does not meet the demands of all current token holders.\n\n## Timeframe:\n\nFor the upcoming funding cycles. \n\n## Copyright Disclaimer:\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n\nIPFS\nhttps://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmY83A2wLqZj1HkC7o7KYRqixNwnFwzDHEHwY4iL76diWd?preview=1\n\nDiscord Discussion\nhttps://discord.com/channels/775859454780244028/873248745771372584/934300031933112354\n\nNotion Proposal\nhttps://www.notion.so/juicebox/Update-discount-rate-to-20-8d53aa97b63c4e9590aa7feedf0e9faa\n",

Update FAQ sections on website if needed and approved. Reduce duplication of effort, use feedback and support experiences to improve accordingly. (I presume mainly on front-end, discord structure and governance)\n- Tweet or write article about Juicebox ecosystems in English and/or in Chinese.

At a 10% discount rate, projects receive 10% fewer JBX tokens per ETH contributed every funding cycle (14 days), and the reserved token recipients (the DAO included) receive 10% fewer JBX each Funding cycle per ETH contributed also.\n\nThis proposal reduces this rate to 4%, broadening access to JBX over time and the JBX supply alongside.\n\n## Motivation:\n\nJBX accessibility is important — the network is only as strong and resilient as is the distribution of JBX over time.\n\nProjects operating on Juicebox and contributors building Juicebox are among the biggest advocates for the platform. As such we've got to make sure they continue to be significant JBX members over time.\n\nThe risk profile of using Juicebox or contributing to the platform is no longer decreasing at a significant rate on a bi-weekly basis, there is no longer much justified reason for valueing two different contribution made to the DAO one funding cycle apart at a 10% difference.\n\n## Risks:\n\nMore JBX will be distributed per ETH ocntributed to the JuiceboxDAO treasury. There is a chance projects or contributors will feel less inclined to join if they know subsequent joiners in future cycles are getting memberships rates more comensurate to theirs despite the difference in time.\n\n## Specification:\n\nDiscount rate to 4%.\n\n## Rationale:\n\nThere's no real reason for choosing 4%, apart from the fact that it's significantly lower than 10%, and non-zero. \n\n## Timeframe:\n\nNext FC configuration.\n\n## Copyright Disclaimer:\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n\n\nIPFS\nhttps://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmQYXbgFSQJAzM1hYJ95HQHsddpJyPrgN8jipKeLLQvmN2?preview=1\n\nDiscord Discussion\nhttps://discord.com/channels/775859454780244028/873248745771372584/936674114775683173\n\nNotion Proposal\nhttps://www.notion.so/juicebox/Discount-rate-to-4-3395184fbc11458eba8b5023a57f6868\n",

      "content": "\n*After a trial period of 1-3 cycles, contributors are encouraged to propose a recurring role for themselves. Recurring payouts should be renewed/updated every 90 days.*\n\n### **Author:**\n\nLexicon Devils\n\n### **Proposal date:**\n\nJanuary 26, 2022\n\n### Summary:\n\nLexicon Devils proposes that our team continue to manage Juicebox’s Cryptovoxel’s Lounge, Learning Center, and Juicebar (abbreviated henceforth as “Juicebar”). Our management would include curating voxel experiences and continued modular design within the Juicebar.\n\n### Risks:\n\nLack of attendance to some events / indirect, ambient value that doesn't materialize in direct engagement with the Juicebox protocol.\n\n### **Payout recipient:**\n\n0x82F018c331231f2A27b68DDbDDe61429338D86E8\n\n### **Payout amount:**\n\nUS$6600 (paid in ETH) bi-weekly\n\n### **How have you contributed to the DAO?**\n\nLexicon Devils were contracted to build and design Juicebox DAO’s Cryptovoxel space, the Juicebox Juicebar. Along with WAGMI DAO Lexicon Devils designed and curated the Juicebar space and have continued to alter it and update it. With immersive, engaging, and unique builds Lexicon Devils draw from a quiver of voxel architects, graphic designers, and 3d artists that came together to make Juicebar and exciting and unique voxel experience.\n\n### How do you want to contribute to the DAO going forward**?**\n\nMoving forward Lexicon Devils would curate events where Juicebox creators can come and talk about their projects at the Juicebar. We would also like to bring in artists and talent to use the space to talk about and engage others with their voxel experience. We would ensure that the space remains modular for each new experience built with the integrity that we created it.\n\nThe Lexicon Devil team would also spearhead social media engagement and aim to divert traffic from other platforms onto Cryptovoxels, specifically to the Juicebar. We’d do this by creating games that users could engage with to interact with the space. Wearables and voxel models would be meticulously sculpted by our team to the speculations of campaigns. Our goals can be summed up in saying that we’d like to make the space immersive, raise the amount of engagement and maintain the property to a quality standard.\n\n### **What does success look like for someone taking on your role?**\n\n1. Increasing the volume of traffic to Juicebar\n\n2. Work on gameified social media campaigns that engage the public\n\n3. Create a calendar for regular events\n\n### **Under what criteria should the community reassess this payout?**\n\n*If this proposal payout amount is beyond the DAO's wishes at the moment, we can adjust the amount of programming we do at the juicebar.*\n\n---\n\n**Note: recurring payout recipients are required to participate in votes for future payout allocations. For payouts to non-EOAs, attach an address that will manage voting on the non-EOA address's behalf.**\n\nIPFS\nhttps://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmbAQrVBUGr5jjLfd9Wq9KKhtfPhuuP72tP6DJjpNm87cW?preview=1\n\nDiscord Discussion\nhttps://discord.com/channels/775859454780244028/936291585262514186/936769133167657040\n\nNotion Proposal\nhttps://www.notion.so/juicebox/Lexicon-Devils-continued-curation-and-management-of-the-Juicebox-Lounge-Learning-Center-and-Juiceb-e57f1431bc7243c8b9f7a5ccc24bad41\n",

      "content": "*Prospective paid contributors to Juicebox DAO are encouraged to propose a trial period of one or more cycles to check compatibility. Trial payouts typically range from $300-600 per cycle.*\n\n### **Author:**\n\ngulan\n\n### **Proposal date:**\n\nJan 2, 2022\n\n### **Summary:**\n\nto provide an Incentive of $1000 per cycle to gulan to formally participate in the DAO in the areas of accounting and governance.\n\n### Risks:\n\nThere is not any forseeable risks to the DAO that would otherwise be non-nominal. The recipient holds the payout address and is cognizant of personal security risks.\n\n### **Payout recipient:**\n\ngulan eth account: 0xF8284136B169213E4c50cE09f3E1D9A9b484BAea\n\n### **Payout amount:**\n\nAdd gulan as trial payment for retroactive FC#13 and FC#14 to be paid on FC#14\nFC#13 1000\n\nFC#14 1000\n\nTotal for FC#14 2000.\n\n### How **have you already contributed to the DAO?**\n\nFor the past 3 cycles I have created 1 off speadsheets, importing the data directly from snapshot, interpreting that data, and then producing a report that jango has used to configure the payouts. I have done this task manually to learn the current process and needs of the DAO, but it definitely needs to be a repeatable, single source of truth dashboard.. There are definitely holes, primarily in refunds and multisig direct payouts. On the refund front, although my report has identified the amount that needs to be refunded, there is not currently an SOP for this disbursement and confirmation/audit. For multisig direct payouts, there was a case in FC#12 where a proposal was approved to pay a vendor for a security audit. Currently that money is authorized, but again there is no SOP or controls to facilitate these instances.\n\n### How do you want to contribute to the DAO going forward**?**\n\n- Merging notion data and snapshot data on a scheduled basis and producing automated reporting. This will require some changes to the current notion proposal fields.\n- Refund dashboard & SOP, including multisig auth's and jbx distro. The next iteration here will include bringing refunds for services that the dao uses (hosting etc.)\n- One time payments SOP, this probably includes changes to notion as well.\n- I would love to create an chat bot on discord to automatically send individual reports and notifications. Such as hey, you were just sent x for y.\n\nIn other fields, I have a background in governance, particularly in parliamentary procedure. I am also very familiar with 'customer facing' tools, such as crms, csm ticketing systems, chatbots etc. I have not made any suggestions on this front yet.\n\nIPFS\nhttps://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmcZN7bpoewyirrPosPm9UCAuw2XdzWLqi3sJmnzHiAGGE?preview=1\n\nDiscord Discussion\nhttps://discord.com/channels/775859454780244028/873248745771372584/930915297244905492\n\nNotion\nhttps://www.notion.so/juicebox/Add-gulan-to-trial-period-payout-4013730f452744b6b5887a02f8f37809\n",

Develop and implement utilities for tokens in the Juicebox ecosystem.\n\n### **Project Management**\n\nRegularly assess, refine, and publicly communicate the goals and progress of Juicebox DAO, contributors, and groups of contributors.\n\n### **What is the expected impact of these changes?**\n\nBy ratifying community support for the mechanism focus area, this proposal paves the way for future updates to JBX mechanisms and mechanics that will increase the utility of the JBX token, and could also apply to the tokens of individual projects on the protocol.\n\nBy ratifying community support for the project management focus area, this proposal would solidify the positions of contributors who are already helping on this front (such as [Zom_bae](https://www.notion.so/Zom_bae-7cbb9ce30379449faf73357acb5256b4) and [Zótico](https://www.notion.so/Z-tico-cc5811dad7fa4c139d630870f9b00ddb)).\n\n### Risks:\n\nExtensive mechanism updates will add increasing complexity to a protocol that is already hard for many to understand. Smart contracts for future JBX mechanics could be costly to audit, and vulnerable to hackers. New token utilities could lead to higher levels of risk for participants.\n\nHierarchical Project Management can grow to a wasteful level extremely quickly. It is important that Juicebox DAO does not over-allocate resources to this focus area, and that most contributors will be able to self-manage. The fundamental ethos of a DAO is non-hierarchical.\n\n### W**hat help might be needed from Juicebox DAO and its members?**\n\nCommunity members will need to watch both of these focus areas closely, both to participate and to provide oversight. All focus areas should be in support of the DAO’s fundamental mission.\n\n### **Sponsors:**\n\n\nIPFS\nhttps://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmY17HdToiRjgVGwQCATp28tupr2Zh3AArYBBSjihc2NML?preview=1\n\nDiscord Discussion\nhttps://discord.com/channels/775859454780244028/873248745771372584/930139553308753920\n\nNotion\nhttps://www.notion.so/juicebox/JuiceboxDAO-Foundation-Amendment-1-8ffea6d5c63e417394213af8379e028b\n",

The work included:\n\n- Driving all Mechanism discussions culminating in proposing to add [Mechanism](https://www.notion.so/JuiceboxDAO-Foundation-Amendment-1-8ffea6d5c63e417394213af8379e028b) as a focus area of the JuiceboxDAO foundation (FC14 proposal)\n- Leading the discussion, proposal, and change to the [Bonding Curve](https://www.notion.so/Adjusting-JBX-Bonding-Curve-2c9e95b315d944da91ce1864c910ab67), [Reserve Rate](https://www.notion.so/Update-JBX-Reserve-Rate-as-a-way-to-strengthen-JBX-membership-af93988ca3fe44828475fe9138d34675), and deployment of the [JBX Token Treasury](https://www.notion.so/Move-JBX-from-treasury-to-contributors-168e61808a184924b17549c34a8297ef) during FC12\n- Developing comprehensive research on existing mechanism levers and capturing it in a new Mechanism workspace in the [Juicebox notion](https://www.notion.so/Mechanism-Workspace-ea1e928a617e46339cf925f6ccfedfd9)\n- Building a JBX token [mechanism model](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tPdMVDT6CoVmtspFSXu-osIYKJhiiTyo/edit?usp=drive_web&ouid=117459388894321402795&rtpof=true) to develop a mathematical understanding of how changes to the mechanism impact the JBX token\n- Initiating the discussion of JBX token staking and co-creating an [initial framework for staking mechanics](https://www.notion.so/JBX-Staking-Take-2-6dcf8d7a00214751979dedc4dc53273c)\n- Acting as a point of contract in the Juicebox Discord for mechanism questions for new members\n- Collaborating with Analytics team members to develop JBX Dune dashboards\n- Support the security of the Juicebox protocol by developing a proposal to [create a bounty system](https://www.notion.so/JBX-Bug-Bounty-18cf1b7d1c8c426fa0753163f59adbc4) and conduct an [Audit](https://www.notion.so/Juicebox-Smart-Contract-Audit-d668152d6ccc49d5b2fe682a0b9683bc). Both items are pending the launch of V2.0\n\n### How do you want to contribute to the DAO going forward**?**\n\nI will continue to work on the following areas to support the JuiceboxDAO and ecosystem:\n\n- Transparently drive forward Mechanism research the JuiceboxDAO and the Juicebox ecosystem at large(Mechanism updates and learning can be implemented in projects working on the Juicebox protocol)\n- Finalize the design of the staking mechanism and support the its roll out across the ecosystem including future protocol pricing features\n- Develop JBX Dune dashboards (in collaboration with the Analytics team) to source JBX historical data enhancing the existing JBX token model\n- Help develop methodologies to deploy the Juicebox treasury (dedicated vaults, Treasury DAO, etc.)\n- Continue supporting the protocol security (post V2 launch)\n\n### Risks:\n\nThe Juicebox Mechanism is both an important and a highly visible part of the Juicebox protocol. \n\nA delicate and ongoing approach is needed to balance the community needs with the long term development of the protocol. \n\nLack of focus, overcomplication, and short term orientation are some of the pitfalls that I should be cautions about while helping the DAO navigate the space.         \n\n### **What does success look like for someone taking on your role?**\n\n- Deepening our collective understanding of the potential in the Juicebox Protocol Mechanism\n- Identifying and developing tangible new methods to continue improving the Juicebox Protocol mechanism\n\n### **Under what criteria should the community reassess this payout?**\n\nThe payment amount should be adjusted as I take on additional responsibilities, do not present progress on research areas, or shift my focus towards other tasks\n\n### **Sponsors:**\n\nI have been collaborating with the following individuals within the protocol:\n\n- Mechanism - @Jango  , @filipv.eth, @Dr Gorilla, @nicholas\n- Analytics & Protocol Security - [twodam.eth](https://www.notion.so/twodam-eth-188b6f9a28dc4667b9d915fa0a379de1)\n\n---\n\n**Note: recurring payout recipients are required to participate in votes for future payout allocations. For payouts to non-EOAs, attach an address that will manage voting on the non-EOA address's behalf.**\n\nIPFS\nhttps://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmVP2vqUPKoYzXz91Qkco6guzuEvUX4qtKng1EnrWLS9d2?preview=1\n\nDiscord Discussion\nhttps://discord.com/channels/775859454780244028/873248745771372584/930912917971427430\n\nNotion\nhttps://www.notion.so/juicebox/Add-Mr-Goldstein-to-reoccurring-payout-9aa014b9cf854424942470a8e88f2145\n",

We're also moving in the system testing phase and prepping the contracts for an official audit on Jan 24.\n\nIt's been fun and educational working alongside @Jango , @Exekias , @Dr Gorilla and others on this endeavor.\n\n- JBToken tests [https://github.com/jbx-protocol/juice-contracts-v2/pull/29](https://github.com/jbx-protocol/juice-contracts-v2/pull/29)\n- Finish off JBTokenStore tests [https://github.com/jbx-protocol/juice-contracts-v2/pull/32](https://github.com/jbx-protocol/juice-contracts-v2/pull/32)\n- Debug, fix, and write a test utility for JBFundingCycleMetadataResolver [https://github.com/jbx-protocol/juice-contracts-v2/pull/38](https://github.com/jbx-protocol/juice-contracts-v2/pull/38)\n- JBFundingCycleMetadataResolver tests [https://github.com/jbx-protocol/juice-contracts-v2/pull/52](https://github.com/jbx-protocol/juice-contracts-v2/pull/52)\n- JBETHPaymentTerminalStore tests [https://github.com/jbx-protocol/juice-contracts-v2/pull/43](https://github.com/jbx-protocol/juice-contracts-v2/pull/43)\n- Currently helping out with JBETHPaymentTerminal tests [https://github.com/jbx-protocol/juice-contracts-v2/pull/49](https://github.com/jbx-protocol/juice-contracts-v2/pull/49)\n- Discussing and scheming our potential new mechanism design\n\n### How do you want to contribute to the DAO going forward**?**\n\nIn the short term, V2 stuff.\n\nIn the long term, areas of interest that I'd like to build out for Juicebox are extensions for the V2 contracts, the vote-locking staking mechanism, and perhaps forking the protocol to other L1s and L2s.\n\n### **What does success look like for someone taking on your role?**\n\nShips code, reviews code, consistent team player, communicates clearly and effectively, eager to learn, offers ideas/suggestions for design and implementation, and active in the community.\n\n### **Under what criteria should the community reassess this payout?**\n\nThere are three scenarios where my payout may need to be reassessed:\n\n1. My personal circumstances change such that I am unable to contribute at an acceptable level. In this case, my payout should be reduced or removed.\n2. My responsibility grows within the DAO, and more of my time is required. In this case, I would propose an increase to my payout.\n3. I become available to the DAO full-time. In this case, I would propose an increase to my payout.\n\n### **Sponsors:**\n\n@Jango @Exekias @Dr Gorilla \n\n---\n\n**Note: recurring payout recipients are required to participate in votes for future payout allocations.

I set up Github actions to automatically upload and download translations to and from Crowdin (https://github.com/jbx-protocol/juice-interface/pull/329), setup the [Juicebox project in the Crowdin interface](https://crowdin.com/project/juicebox-interface) and created instructions on Notion for [translators](https://www.notion.so/Contribute-translations-to-the-Juicebox-site-81fdd9344ef043909a48bd7373ef73d7) and [managers](https://www.notion.so/Crowdin-for-translation-managers-and-proofreaders-371ae195395740f5a5bced8f312ca71e) in using the new system. Crowdin has already seen massive amounts of new translations added to the site.\n- Designed and implemented a language selector as seen in the top nav and footer (https://github.com/jbx-protocol/juice-interface/pull/309).\n- Configured site for Turkish and Russian languages (https://github.com/jbx-protocol/juice-interface/pull/348)\n\n### Other UI changes:\n\n- Redesigned and implemented a new top nav for desktop (https://github.com/jbx-protocol/juice-interface/pull/317) and mobile (https://github.com/jbx-protocol/juice-interface/pull/340).\n- Design and implement a ‘Copy to Clipboard’ icon for ETH addresses (https://github.com/jbx-protocol/juice-interface/pull/346)\n- Implement a ‘Share to Twitter’ modal when user donates to a project (https://github.com/jbx-protocol/juice-interface/pull/345)\n- Implement button to link to @Zhou Jason’s new feedback form (https://github.com/jbx-protocol/juice-interface/pull/370)\n- Small bug fixes: https://github.com/jbx-protocol/juice-interface/pull/369, https://github.com/jbx-protocol/juice-interface/pull/368\n\n### How do you want to contribute to the DAO going forward**?**\n\nIf this proposal passes, I’ll be quitting my current Web2 job and working on Juicebox’s front-end full time. \n\n### Continue improving Juicebox’s front-end\n\nThe front-end workload of Juicebox is only going to increase and the front-end team will need all the help it can get.

      "content": "### **Author:**\n\nNicholas and Filip\n\n### **Proposal date:**\n\nJanuary 13, 2022\n\n### Summary:\n\nDelegate discussions with lawyers to Filip and Nicholas until February 28, 2022. Filip and Nicholas will regularly communicate updates to the DAO through public meetings in the Discord, and bring the DAO’s questions back to the lawyers.\n\n### Risks:\n\nFilip and Nicholas could fail to fully and transparently communicate information bi-directionally between the DAO and the lawyers.\n\nPrivate discussions are a departure from the DAO’s typical entirely public work practices. Private conversations may lead to DAO members feeling alienated from the process and less involved in legal information acquisition. While all legal decisions concerning the DAO will still be made by the whole of the DAO through the typical governance process, the primary risk here is that legal advice from counsel be disregarded because DAO members feel less personal ownership over this information.\n\n### **What are the changes being proposed?**\n\nDesignate Filip and Nicholas as liaisons with legal counsel. By approving of this proposal, DAO members acknowledge that Filip and Nicholas may have private discussions with lawyers in the interest of researching how to shore up the DAOs legal compliance across a variety of domains.\n\nFilip and Nicholas will summarize and communicate all relevant learnings from these conversations to the DAO through public meetings (Town Hall or Legal focus meetings). They will also communicate DAO members’ questions back to the legal counsel.   \n\n### **What is the goal of this proposal?**\n\nThe goal of this proposal is to efficiently conduct legal research and present these research findings publicly to enable DAO members to make informed decisions as individuals and DAO members. \n\nIn the interest of making informed legal decisions as individuals and as a DAO, we propose delegating the responsibility of legal research to Filip and Nicholas. As legal research delegates, the DAO permits Filip and Nicholas to host public and private meetings with lawyers and subsets of the DAO membership to achieve clarity on the various legal areas of concern facing the DAO.\n\nFilip and Nicholas will communicate their findings back to the DAO regularly through public channels such as Town Halls and Legal meetings. They will also make all possible efforts to communicate DAO members questions and concerns to the lawyers.\n\n### **What is the expected impact of these changes?**\n\nWith this mandate in hand, Filip and Nicholas will be given formal permission to host private meetings with lawyers as necessary. \n\n### W**hat help might be needed from Juicebox DAO and its members?**\n\nTo succeed in this research project, DAO members will need to cooperate with the research team and provide feedback each step of the way. \n\n### **Sponsors:**\n\n*Community members who agree to act as spokespeople for this proposal can add themselves here.*\n\nIPFS\nhttps://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmYbGvsj7eJpca1bNQ3coXDZFipJ86BbiSHo28DJ8RfRKj?preview=1\n\nDiscord Discussion\nhttps://discord.com/channels/775859454780244028/873248745771372584/931557717376647208\n\nNotion\nhttps://www.notion.so/juicebox/Delegate-Legal-Research-to-and-until-February-28-2022-e668e146aaef40728b5d6d00b79e244a\n",

      "content": "*After a trial period of 1-3 cycles, contributors are encouraged to propose a recurring role for themselves. Recurring payouts should be renewed/updated every 90 days.*\n\n### **Author:**\n\n@aeolian \n\n### **Proposal date:**\n\nJanuary 11, 2022\n\n### Summary:\n\nCompensate aeolian.eth US$3,000 (in ETH) per funding cycle for frontend engineering.\n\n### Risks:\n\nIf my circumstances change, my lack of availability might pose the following risks:\n\n- Unable to provide timely bug fixes.\n- Contributions I’m leading may go stale.\n- Unable to provide timely code reviews.\n\n### **Payout recipient:**\n\naeolian.eth\n\n### **Payout amount:**\n\nUS$3,000 (paid in ETH)\n\n### **How have you contributed to the DAO?**\n\nA (mostly) complete list of my contributions can be found here: [@aeolian ‘s contributions](https://www.notion.so/s-contributions-f81ede3e0d584f4d9574e29dac005e47) \n\nSince my [first contribution](https://github.com/jbx-protocol/juice-interface/pull/229) to Juicebox app ~2 months ago, I felt I have become well-integrated into frontend team and JuiceboxDAO generally. As a frontend engineer, I’ve consistently made impactful contributions to the Juicebox app and added value to discussions across multiple domains.\n\n**Notable code contributions include:**\n\n- Added Uniswap price to Juicebox projects (design and implementation) [1]\n- Added multi-language (internationalization) support to the Juicebox app and Juicebox documentation [2, 3]\n- Site performance and technical debt improvements [4]\n- UI/UX improvements [5]\n- Contributor experience and documentation improvements [6]\n- Project page redesign (in progress) [7]\n- Juicebox terminology audit (in progress) [8]\n\n### How do you want to contribute to the DAO going forward**?**\n\nI’m committed to making the Juicebox app the best it can possibly be. This means continuing to add features and fix bugs, as well as continuing to improve the maintainability of Juicebox by cleaning up technical debt.\n\n**Short-term goals include:**\n\n- Adding Sushiswap price to the interface [9]\n- Project page redesign (design and implementation) [7]\n- Various maintainability improvements [10]\n\n**Medium term goals include:**\n\n- Improve usability of Juicebox.\n    \n    I’m most interested in making Juicebox easier to use and understand. Simplifying Juicebox may be one of the most critical factors to continued adoption of the Juicebox platform. This requires a broad skillset that spans copywriting, technical writing, UI/UX design and programming; I believe I’ve demonstrated these skills in my contributions thus far.\n    \n- Contribute to the launch of Juicebox V2.\n- Become a maintainer of the Juicebox frontend.\n    \n    Currently, the Juicebox app codebase only has one maintainer - Peri. A lot of Peri’s time is spent reviewing contributions (which is very much appreciated), but continuous context-switching can take a toll and shift focus away from other high-leverage work (like the v1.1 migration). As I become more familiar with the codebase and trusted by the DAO, I believe I could join Peri as a maintainer of the Juicebox frontend codebase. Having maintained a few popular open source projects, I’m aware of the responsibility this entails - baby steps!\n    \n\n### **What does success look like for someone taking on your role?**\n\n- Shipping features, bug fixes and UI improvements.\n- Reviewing code contributions.\n- Maturing the contribution and workflow processes for design and dev.\n\n### **Under what criteria should the community reassess this payout?**\n\nThere are three scenarios where my payout may need to be reassessed:\n\n1. My personal circumstances change such that I am unable to contribute at an acceptable level. In this case, my payout should be reduced or removed.\n2. My responsibility grows within the DAO, and more of my time is required. In this case, I would propose an increase to my payout.\n3. I become available to the DAO full-time. In this case, I would propose an increase to my payout.\n\n---\n\n[1] - https://github.com/jbx-protocol/juice-interface/pull/311\n\n[2] - https://github.com/jbx-protocol/juice-interface/pull/236\n\n[3] - [Add i18n support to docs.juicebox.money](https://www.notion.so/Add-i18n-support-to-docs-juicebox-money-22fea917f3c94f61bc936715cf317961) \n\n[4] - [https://www.notion.so/juicebox/s-contributions-f81ede3e0d584f4d9574e29dac005e47#0c3bb1d5e99b4e98a4d0c8bc79e23b96](https://www.notion.so/s-contributions-f81ede3e0d584f4d9574e29dac005e47)\n\n[5] - [https://www.notion.so/juicebox/s-contributions-f81ede3e0d584f4d9574e29dac005e47#e45f921e5a494f47acc97abb6e1d5096](https://www.notion.so/s-contributions-f81ede3e0d584f4d9574e29dac005e47)\n\n[6] - [https://www.notion.so/juicebox/s-contributions-f81ede3e0d584f4d9574e29dac005e47#0f310e3b46c8440780707e1cc6faee94](https://www.notion.so/s-contributions-f81ede3e0d584f4d9574e29dac005e47)\n\n[7] - [Improve UI for individual project page](https://www.notion.so/Improve-UI-for-individual-project-page-9d7d7dcf10c84c088d5a3cb7e21946c2) \n\n[8] - [Consolidate Juicebox lexicon](https://www.notion.so/Consolidate-Juicebox-lexicon-24aaa2b1936a4416a213ddb36dca67e4) \n\n[9] - https://github.com/jbx-protocol/juice-interface/issues/344\n\n[10] - For example, https://github.com/jbx-protocol/juice-interface/issues/343\n\n---\n\n**Note: recurring payout recipients are required to participate in votes for future payout allocations.

      "title": "JBP-86 - Introduce a Generalized Proposal Template",
      "content": "*This proposal deviates from existing proposal templates in order to demonstrate the generalized proposal template that this proposal would implement.*\n\n## Summary:\n\nIf passed, this proposal would implement a generalized template for Juicebox proposals.\n\n## Abstract:\n\nThis proposal will implement a new template for Juicebox proposals that bears similarity to proposal templates in other established web3 communities. The new prompts will be:\n\nSummary, Abstract, Motivation, Risks, Specification, Rationale, Timeframe, and Copyright Disclaimer.\n\nThis new template **will not** replace current proposal templates—for the time being, it will supplement them.\n\n## Motivation:\n\nThe various templates in use right now lack the consistency and modularity that a generalized template would provide. Proposals that don’t exactly fit within a category are often forced to use a template that does not apply. Many of the prompts within the current templates are not applicable to many proposals within their respective categories, leading to forced, awkward answers. The goal of this generalized proposal template is to maximize information density and the readability of future proposals.\n\n## Risks:\n\nFor newer contributors, the specific prompts in existing templates can be of value—if someone does not know how to propose a trial payment, the template can be a valuable resource. To mitigate this risk, the generalized proposal template will appear alongside existing templates for the time being.\n\nAnother risk lies in the disruption of process. Many contributors are used to filling out the existing templates, meaning that any change to the process could slow things down. Although this is an initial risk, the generalized proposal template will allow for more effective analysis and greater understanding of various prompts in the long run—when every proposal has the same prompts, the efficacy and efficiency of those prompts becomes much easier to evaluate.\n\n## Specification:\n\n- Introduce [DRAFT: General Proposal Template](https://www.notion.so/DRAFT-General-Proposal-Template-e20ece1e4f1949bfa79ed7cf589ace6a) as a template in [](https://www.notion.so/9d126f9148dc42ee83317d5cd74e4db4) on Notion.\n- Add [General Proposal Guide](https://www.notion.so/General-Proposal-Guide-3d81e6bb330a4c869bddd0d6449ac032) to [Guides](https://www.notion.so/Guides-456917342e7c4ea0b01e56d5151f9ea6).\n- Update [How to Make a Governance Proposal](https://www.notion.so/How-to-Make-a-Governance-Proposal-d841f3530f10464ba8b6c745eebc94d6) to reflect these changes.\n- Update the #**🟦-how-to-create-proposal** channel on the 🧃Juicebox DAO Discord server to reflect these changes.\n- Share these updates in the next Juicebox Town Hall and encourage future use of the generalized template.\n\n## Rationale:\n\nThe rationale for the format, style, and structure of the generalized proposal template is based on:\n\n- Feedback from the Juicebox community on the cancelled [Proposal System Overhaul](https://www.notion.so/Proposal-System-Overhaul-897672deea3e47e1b719377700de06e1).\n- [Ethereum Improvement Proposal 1](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1)\n- [Bitcoin Improvement Proposal 1](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0001.mediawiki)\n- [Python Enhancement Proposal 1](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0001/)\n\nAlong with various other DAO governance structures. This specification was designed to make the transition from existing templates smooth and to fit well within the Juicebox [Governance Process](https://www.notion.so/Governance-Process-38e3d9990bd94c738f56fa749a4bd209). Ideally, these changes will promote informed discussion around future Juicebox Proposals.\n\n## Timeframe:\n\nIf this proposal passes, proposals for FC#15 would be the first that could use the generalized proposal template. At the start of FC#17, this template should be evaluated and updated if necessary. If the Juicebox community completely or almost completely switches over to the generalized proposal template, a new proposal will be necessary in order to remove the existing category-based proposal templates.\n\n## Copyright Disclaimer:\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n\nIPFS \nhttps://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmQdmQ1p86jut8JZq4i7qBu9Yt15aeHGYuHjYBfNmNR8VF?preview=1\n\nDiscord Discussion\nhttps://discord.com/channels/775859454780244028/873248745771372584/931664271841038337\n\nNotion\nhttps://www.notion.so/juicebox/Introduce-a-Generalized-Proposal-Template-70cd48fb0d3e45fca43d1c8039d3ea6e\n",

By adjusting this lever closer to 100%, the JuiceboxDAO provides early contributors a better incentive to burn JBX tokens in return for a portion of the treasury thus better distributing governance among the JuiceboxDAO memebers.\n\nWe propose to adjust the Bonding Curve from 60% to 70%. At 60%, the DAO is currently offering 1 ETH back from the treasury for each 679,652 JBX ****burned. At 70%, this will be 1 ETH for about 594,600 JBX burned.\n\n### **What changes should be made to the bonding curve?**\n\nAdjust bonding curve from 60% to 70%\n\n### **What changes should be made to the reconfiguration ballot?**\n\nN/A\n\n### **What is the expected short term impact and longer term impact of enacting the changes being proposed?**\n\n- Reduce JBX token inflation by incentivizing token holders to burn JBX in return for ETH\n- Better aligns incentives between early and new JBX token holders\n- Enables early JBX token holders to redeem ETH for JBX to better distribute JBX tokens and governance power\n\n### **What potential tradeoffs should we be monitoring over time if the proposal were to be adopted?**\n\n- Reduction in JuiceboxDAO treasury due to increased redemptions\n\n### **For this proposal to reach its full potential, what other help might be needed from the DAO?**\n\nN/A\n\n### **Sponsors:**\n\n[Jango](https://www.notion.so/Jango-3d619a88d22048128b2be209c4fcbcb9) [filipv.eth](https://www.notion.so/filipv-eth-0fc06b16681e479db64e12b16908dbbf)\n\n\nSee This Proposal on IPFS:\nhttps://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmbfJoKZPXE5DYjJyFHA8kEnrrPCvkckGuDXVFB6GsWvgc\n\nLink to Discussion Thread:\nhttps://discord.com/channels/775859454780244028/873248745771372584/921546571252916285\n\nLink to Proposal on Notion:\nhttps://www.notion.so/juicebox/Adjusting-JBX-Bonding-Curve-2c9e95b315d944da91ce1864c910ab67\n\n",

V2.0 bug bounty program should start only after the protocol audit.\nAllocate 50 ETH (<1%) of the treasury towards potential payouts. Detailed bounties will be designed upon the initial program approval and proposed within 2 governance cycles.\n### **What is the goal of this proposal?**\nStart a new bug bounty program. All bounties values will be represented in USD and scaled  based on the [Immunefi severity Classification System](https://immunefi.com/severity-updated/).\n### **What is the process being addressed?**\nCode security.\n### **What is the current inefficiency in the process that this proposal seeks to fix?**\nCurrently there is no formal bug bounty program. With over $80M residing in the JBX Smart Contracts, if a bug is found it is likely to get exploited. Formalizing a program will help improve the Smart Contract security through independent researcher validation.\n### **What are the changes to the process being proposed?**\nNo changes, additional work is required to create and track the program.\n### **What are the potential risks and tradeoffs of this proposal that we should monitor over time?**\nAdding a bug bounty program increases protocol visibility with the researcher community.\n### **Sponsors:**\n\n\nSee This Proposal on IPFS:\nhttps://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmVXAcXENaACCwXzgnNS9k89jedfA5Yvs4VEkF7bx1meWP\n\nLink to Discussion Thread:\nhttps://discord.com/channels/775859454780244028/919813435821293569/921823521708064848\n\nLink to Proposal on Notion:\nhttps://www.notion.so/juicebox/JBX-Bug-Bounty-18cf1b7d1c8c426fa0753163f59adbc4\n",

      "content": "*As new ideas emerge, contributors are encouraged to propose new guidelines and amend existing ones.*\n\n### **Author:**\n\nZeugh + Translators + Zótico\n\n### **Proposal date:**\n\nDecember 17, 2021\n\n### Summary:\n\nTo be able to **pay for the translators work by word** we need a new type of payment structure. This proposal is to allocate 10 eth to Zeugh’s [tip.cc](http://tip.cc) wallet, who will make a recurring payout trough [tip.cc](http://tip.cc) bot, every 2 weeks, to zótico tip wallet, with varying amounts based on the values that shoul be payed to for translations in the period., which zótico should then distribute between translators based on translated and revised word-count.\n\n### Risks:\n\nThis can get complicated over time if the amount of translation grows too much and we might need to create better definitions on how this works. This is an experiment on the best way to manage multi language translations all at once and also on how to pay a group recurring with non-fixed value. \n\n### **What are the changes being proposed?**\n\n**[Pay $0.1 per word in the original document trough [tip.cc](http://tip.cc) to translators, every 14 days] \n[Pay $0.05 per word in the original document trough [tip.cc](http://tip.cc) to reviewers, every 14 days]** \n\nThe creation of a process where [Zótico](https://www.notion.so/Z-tico-cc5811dad7fa4c139d630870f9b00ddb) can post a bi-weekly report on the bookkeeping channel, summarizing the translations made and the amount to be paid to each translator/reviser for those.\n\nThe suggested amount is 10 cents a word for translator and 5 cents a word for the reviewer, that is above general translation market value with the goal to incentivize people to onboard web3. The word count per piece currently in the [Translation Workspace](https://www.notion.so/Translation-Workspace-e25808352c2947f983b8dc8daea093d3) varies about 300-1000, so we are talking 45-150 dollars per document.\n\nThe payments are to be made to zotico trough [tip.cc](http://tip.cc) and from there he can manage to transfer those to each of the translators, in the preferred choice of either ETH, JBX or both.\n\nThere’s also the gas cost of taking the money out of tip to be considered, every time someone reaches a $1000 dollars worth of value in their tip.cc wallet they can ask for the gas cost of the transfer to be added, and that should also be managed bi-weekly by zotico. The amount to be allocated to this is to be the average between the lowest and the average gas cost for the transaction in the last 5 days.\n\n### **What is the goal of this proposal?**\n\nTo create a fair and simple to manage system trough which we can pay translators\n\n### **What is the expected impact of these changes?**\n\n[With the current material list, about 5 ETH to translate it all to 5 languages]\n\nWith the current amount of material, considering both translation and revision, this will sum-up to about $3500 per language. This will create the need to consider what material to translate or not and what languages to translate or not in the near future, but will sum up to almost ~5 ETH to translate everything (docs+notion+site) to chinese, spanish, russian, turkish, portuguese, japanese and arabic..\n\nIt will speed up and fairly reward the translation work.\n\nIt will make possible for zotico to actually deliver his tasks\n\nWe should allocate 5 ETH worth of JBX + 5 ETH in Zeugh’s wallet on [tip.cc](http://tip.cc) bot at once to avoid putting new funds in every 14 days.\n\n### **What help might be needed from Juicebox DAO and its members?**\n\nThe bookkeeping team will have to check the biweekly report made by zotico\n\nZeugh will have to transfer funds to zotico [tip.cc](http://tip.cc) biweekly\n\nZotico will have to write reports, keep accounts and make transfers every 14 days to the translators\n\n### **Sponsors:**\n\nZeugh\n\n\nSee This Proposal on IPFS:\nhttps://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmbSNbrmAoyYcEqscDaCHKg4Hn2A2ePBrt22jMr3bmFGrB\n\nLink to Discussion Thread:\nhttps://discord.com/channels/775859454780244028/921480440135712768/921480442245414972\n\nLink to Proposal on Notion:\nhttps://www.notion.so/juicebox/Translation-Payment-specific-proposals-a699f31609ee452daa600c9b47124c29\n",

The delegates can receive JBX second hand in recognition of their own contributions.\n- Consider periodic follow-up allocations via similar means. This can be proposed later once we've received feedback from this initial distribution.\n\n### **What is the expected short term impact and longer term impact of enacting the changes being proposed?**\n\n- Strengthen the membership weight of those in the DAO who have been working on the protocol getting it to where it is.\n- Moves JBX out of the treasury and into the hands of Juicebox ecosystem builders\n- The goal of the program is to align long term interests between contributors and the JuiceboxDAO. To do so we would like to try and measure the long term success of this program by focusing on:\n    - Number of wallets who received JBX and are contributing to JuiceboxDAO within 3/6/12 months after distribution\n    - Number of wallets who held received JBX 3/6/12 months after distribution\n\n### **What potential tradeoffs should we be monitoring over time if the proposal were to be adopted?**\n\n- The DAO will have fewer JBX at its disposal. It'll have to wait until more JBX is minted through treasury contributions (or fees) to accrue more\n- People might be temped to hoard JBX or tip only their friends.\n- If the allocation is not distributed over time, it’s possible that ~125 ETH worth of JBX will be dumped to the market.\n\n### **For this proposal to reach its full potential, what other help might be needed from the DAO?**\n\nEveryone in the DAO needs to do their part to try to distribute JBX to people who are stewarding the DAO's efforts. \n\n### **Sponsors:**\n\nList others from the community who can be spokespeople for this proposal.\n\n\n\nSee This Proposal on IPFS:\nhttps://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmSfwJiRxaUUv8z7Mu6MXQMyyEY1iSzdmZiitDbFPzksWK\n\nLink to Discussion Thread:\nhttps://discord.com/channels/775859454780244028/873248745771372584/921548120251310110\n\nLink to Proposal on Notion:\nhttps://www.notion.so/juicebox/Move-JBX-from-treasury-to-contributors-168e61808a184924b17549c34a8297ef\n",

This proposal is in large part a recognition of commitment and dedication over time. \n\n### Risks:\n\nTaking funds from the treasury to fulfill payouts is always a risk. Respecting the ETH is important.\n\nThis proposal also stretches precedent for payout amounts, but hopefully its backed by merit. \n\n### **Payout recipient:**\n\njango.eth\n\n### **Payout amount:**\n\n$15k per fc\n\n### **How have you contributed to the DAO?**\n\nMost of these bodies of work have been a team effort, some have been solo efforts. I’ve listed the projects that I’ve taken lead on, or have been a significant contributor to.\n\n- helped land both SharkDAO and ConsitutionDAO arrangements, ensuring their smooth launch and operations by being in the room as decisions were being made, orchestrated, and executed. Both have proven pivotal to the public's awareness of and confidence in the protocol.\n- wrote the Juicebox v2 protocol taking into account everything we've learned from V1 thus far. See [here](https://github.com/jbx-protocol/juice-contracts-v2).\n- wrote the Juicebox v1.1 protocol fork and migration testing scripts. See [here](https://github.com/jbx-protocol/juice-contracts-v1/blob/main/contracts/TerminalV1_1.sol), and [here](https://github.com/jbx-protocol/juice-contracts-v1/tree/main/test).\n- wrote full technical specification documentation for Juicebox V2, as well as made progess on `Getting Started` and `Learning` section. See [here](https://docs.juicebox.money/protocol/protocol).\n- generally following notifications around Discord and Twitter from folks asking for help, advice, and knod of confidence. I've historicall been among the most active voices on Discord in #support, #general, #dev, among others.\n- wrote DAO Foundation document, and created the first set of Proposal templates that are still being relied on. See [here](https://www.notion.so/JuiceboxDAO-Foundation-7bd59d35f08443b18e83e710df49ee3b).\n- wrote extensive blog posts explaining how the JuiceboxDAO experiment is progressing. See [here](https://blog.juicebox.money/author/jango/).\n- Helped with [juicebox.money](http://juicebox.money) design decisions on the home page and project page, along with filing numerous bug reports to help ensure a smooth experience for people.\n- Protocol reliability, constantly on-call in case of protocol or community emergencies.\n- Conducted the JBX strategy that has lead to the distribution we currently have.\n- Suported the DAO's growth from an active contributor set of 2 to one of 20+.\n- Supported the Juicebox protocol's growth from 2 active projects to now more than 200.\n\n### How do you want to contribute to the DAO going forward**?**\n\n- Make sure V1.1 is deployed safely and migration paths are communicated effectively to projects on the protocol.\n- Make sure V2 is deployed safely and migration paths are communicated effectively to projects on the protocol.\n- Work towards standing up on-chain governance for Juicebox projects to use, acknowledging the inherent gas-cost tradeoffs.\n- Work towards multi-chain Juicebox to take advantage of vacant block space in Ethereum L2s and beyond perhaps.\n- Work towards more effective fee mechanisms to make sure we have proper alignment between those working on the Juicebox protocol, those building projects using the Juicebox protocol, and those contributing to the treasury directly.\n- Work towards more legal clarity for JuiceboxDAO and its members.\n- Make sure everyone has the resources they need to contribute effectively.\n- Continue helping to communicate to the world what JuiceboxDAO is up to.\n- Continue to help the DAO balance growth and productivity via mechanism and membership tuning.\n- Continue writing my observations into blog posts for the public to follow along and learn from.\n- Continue strategy work that attempts to support the protocol’s efficacy and progression, and corrects for imbalances over time.\n- Work more closely with translators and international contributors who are helping make the Juicebox DAO and protocol more accessible to multi-national builders.\n- Continue to be an advocate for builders in the community and beyond.\n\n### **What does success look like for someone taking on your role?**\n\nSuccess means a DAO that is making strides towards self-sustainability, decentralized power and decision making, and running on autonomous processes, and a protocol that is sturdy and empowering.\n \nWith my stewardship the DAO should continue attracting great builders who communicate with one another effectively and are in tune with the collective sense of direction, attracting great projects who feel the confidence to experiment with ambitious ideas using the juicebox protocol, and working with other builders in the Web3 ecosystem to futher the collective opportunity space for people to come.\n\n### **Under what criteria should the community reassess this payout?**\n\nPlease reasses my payout if I cannot absolutely crush the tall tasks I am professing to be capable of doing. This payout is hefty, it should be monitored closely.\n\n### **Sponsors:**\n\nI've worked closest with @peri @nicholas @Exekias @Mieos @Canu DAO, and increasingly with many newer folks in the DAO @Mr. Goldstein @Zom_bae @filipv.eth \n\n[Zeugh](https://www.notion.so/Zeugh-d2e9734ddbfd432ea06098c264690162) @Zom_bae \n\n---\n\n**Note: recurring payouts recipients are required to participate in votes for future payout allocations.

      "content": "### **Author:**\n\nMieos\n\n### **Proposal date:**\n\nDecember 16, 2021\n\n### Summary:\n\nSecuring WAGMI Studios to continue to bring some of the best illustration, animation, and support talent in web3 to Juiceboxes aid. Ultimately we are investing in WAGMI's unique multi-pronged approach to helping insure that Juicebox has all the cultural and educational tools it needs to succeed as a community, brand, and protocol. \n\n### Risks:\n\nThe risks are not respecting the ETH. Over-payment for a service someone else could do better for less. \n\n### **Payout recipient:**\n\n@wagmistudios\n\n### **Payout amount:**\n\n$5500\n\n### **How have you contributed to the DAO?**\n\n• Collaborated with Lexicon Devils to create a unique digital hangout/education center in Crypto Voxels\n\n• Created logo, iconic Banny and other Juicebox characters featured on the website\n\n• Creating high quality cultural assets for iconic moments in JB history and for yearly events.\n\n• Created 16 emojis and 30 stickers which gives life to the JB Discord\n\n• Educational videos to help explain the more technical features of JB \n\n• Currently working on a Banny pfp project which will bring revenue and exposure to Juicebox \n\n• WAGMI also takes responsibility for being involved from the start by playing rolls in support, onboarding, general channels as well as vibe setting, story telling, teaching, and generally helping drive projects around the JB ecosystem to success through direct engagement. \n\n### How do you want to contribute to the DAO going forward**?**\n\n• Create more educational and informative videos for V2 that helps with onboarding and explaining complex features \n\n• Create infographics/visuals for the V2 website to assist with onboarding and education\n\n• Continue to create and experiment with art and education for JB including : Claymation Banny shorts, new stickers and emojis weekly, animation videos \n\n• Continue to add value to other projects around the ecosystem though support, education, and unique high quality cultural assets. We will constantly strive to bring community support from every angle including 1 on 1 to make sure every JB project has every tool and understanding they need to succeed! \n\n### **What does success look like for someone taking on your role?**\n\n• When JBDAO and JB team are partially known for the brand aesthetic \n\n•  JBDAO and Discord becomes iconic and completely unique in web3 for its vibes, education, and exposure techniques.\n\n• When onboarding no longer includes questions about token mechanics.\n\n### **Under what criteria should the community reassess this payout?**\n\n• When a week goes by and you don't experience DAO / content Joy from our contributions and we fail to educate everyone here in new innovative ways.  \n\n### **Sponsors:**\n\n*List community members who agree to act as spokespeople for this proposal.*\n\n---\n\n**Note: recurring payouts recipients are required to participate in votes for future payout allocations. For payouts to non-EOAs, attach an address that will manage voting on the non-EOA address's behalf.**\n\n\nSee This Proposal on IPFS:\nhttps://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmPvmYsKunYGALsaPUKbfqvxbGyLcoThArY3qjNq6BV8Hd\n\n\nLink to Discussion Thread:\nhttps://discord.com/channels/775859454780244028/873248745771372584/921195862703620157\n\n\nLink to Proposal on Notion:\nhttps://www.notion.so/juicebox/WAGMI-Reoccurring-Payout-f3a563f1090d4b7eac099da555df501a\n\n",

      "content": "### **Author:**\n\n@Jango @Mr. Goldstein \n\n### **Proposal date:**\n\nDecember 17, 2021 \n\n### **What is the goal of this proposal?**\n\nThe goal of this proposal is to strengthen JBX membership by adjusting the Reserve Rate from 35% to 50%.\n\n### **Provide a comprehensive summary of your proposal.**\n\nAt its current state the JuiceboxDAO protocol has 3 key levers that could be adjusted to alter the Mechanism: Discount Rate, Reserve Rate, and Bonding Curve.\n\nWhile all three levers impact the mechanism of the JBX token, every lever has a different impact on the mechanism with various orders of magnitude. \n\nThus far, the JuiceboxDAO has been focused on building and advancing the Juicebox ecosystem by furthering the distribution of the JBX token and incentivizing new builders. Any and all mechanism changes should be focused on continuing that trajectory.\n\nEven though the Juicebox protocol enables the DAO members to create multiple changes to the mechanism every funding cycle, we suggest rolling such changes gradually and not all at once. to that end, **we propose adjusting the existing reserve rate from 35% to 50%.**\n\n- Potential change - adjust the Reserve Rate to 50% from its current value of 35%. Allocate 75% ****of the reserved tokens to the  to the DAO (dao.jbx.eth), and 25% split evenly between DAO delegates (currently the 6 on the reserved list:  jango.eth, peri.eth, exekias.eth, nnnnicholas.eth, wagmi studios, and canu dao)\n- **Impact**\n    - Immediately reduce distributed JBX issuance per ETH contributed\n    - Increase issuance for the DAO itself. Total issuance will remain the same\n    - Further empower the DAO with additional treasury contribution thus empowering network support among builders\n    - Decrease JBX allocation to jango.eth, peri.eth, exekias.eth, nnnnicholas.eth, wagmi studios, and canu dao\n\n### **What changes should be made to the reserved rate?**\n\n35% ⇒ 50%.\n\n- 75.04% to dao.jbx.eth\n- 4.16% to jango.eth\n- 4.16% to peri.eth\n- 4.16% to exekias.eth\n- 4.16% to nnnnicholas.eth\n- 4.16% to canu dao\n- 4.16% to wagmi studios\n\n### **What changes should be made to the reconfiguration ballot?**\n\nN/A\n\n### **What is the expected short term impact and longer term impact of enacting the changes being proposed?**\n\n- Increasing the reserve rate can both strengthen the Juicebox DAO through treasury growth while creating a positive impact on the JBX:ETH ratio\n- As long as the focus of the JuiceboxDAO is on building and advancing the ecosystem, mechanism changes that cater to that (such as this one) should be prioritized\n\n### **What potential tradeoffs should we be monitoring over time if the proposal were to be adopted?**\n\n- Unless distributed to builders, the JuiceboxDAO will accrue tokens that are not used or distributed among members → more \"dead\" tokens\n- Disincentivizing contribution to the JuiceboxDAO treasury\n- Maintaining the similar JBX inflation rate while reducing the contributor issuance rate can make the JBX token less attractive\n\n### **For this proposal to reach its full potential, what other help might be needed from the DAO?**\n\nEveryone in the DAO needs to do their part to try to distribute JBX to people who are stewarding the DAO's efforts. \n\n### **Sponsors:**\n\n@jango\n\nSee This Proposal on IPFS:\nhttps://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmTeAqgVescU4xDQxZFs5shkGmDxBSMAvxrKm2VxFRnEQP\n\nLink to Discussion Thread:\nhttps://discord.com/channels/775859454780244028/873248745771372584/921546888250003466\n\nLink to Proposal on Notion:\nhttps://www.notion.so/juicebox/Update-JBX-Reserve-Rate-as-a-way-to-strengthen-JBX-membership-af93988ca3fe44828475fe9138d34675\n\n",

Here are some of my unit tests (merged with V2 main branch): https://github.com/jbx-protocol/juice-contracts-v2/pull/28 https://github.com/jbx-protocol/juice-contracts-v2/pull/37. I've been actively discussing in the V2 Discord thread any findings (bug, weird things, etc) and optimization ideas.\nOn top of my solidity dev role, I've started gathering ideas and feedback on a way to improve the \"trial period\" process & payout, and I'll submit a proposal with that purpose.\n\n### **What role do you plan on playing in the community going forward?**\n\n- Continue testing, optimizing and challenging our current V2 codebase, leading to its audit and launch.\n- Longer term: build custom components (controllers, terminals) on top of it, in order to meet specific DAOs needs.\n- Grow/keep an active governance role, especially with the newcomer onboarding related processes\n\n### **How much do you want to earn? What else do you foresee needing from the community for you to do your best work?**\n\n- 3500$/cycle\n- Active participation of community members in onboarding discussions\n\n### **What does success look like for someone taking on your role?**\n\n- Able to receive and implement feedbacks, as well as giving good ones\n- Being reliable, especially regarding tasks assignment (\"if I take this, I'll do it and make others know that I'm doing it\") and avoiding any gap or overlap in what's being coded/tested\n- Produce a decent code but more importantly being able to challenge it and adapt it (cf first point) - things are not perfect but good enough, and it's rather the attitude toward it which leads to contract quality\n\n### **Under what criteria might it make sense for the community to reassess this payout allocation to you?**\n\n- Leading to payout decrease/discontinuation : MIA (unfortunately, the metaverse transition is incomplete, people still die in physical life), poor team work abilities/lack social skills, inability to consistently deliver decent code & to implement reviews/feedbacks\n- Leading to increase: increase in dev or governance tasks workload (absolute quantity, shorter deadlines, etc)\n\n### **Sponsors:**\n\n[Jango](https://www.notion.so/Jango-3d619a88d22048128b2be209c4fcbcb9) [exekias](https://www.notion.so/exekias-2b991d5f72fa42079d1dfed12893280f)\n\n\nSee This Proposal on IPFS:\nhttps://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmTwwteAHBNN29rB3Fzz9PXwUrwQ683R8faLqMnJsZLoC5\n\nLink to Discussion Thread:\nhttps://discord.com/channels/775859454780244028/873248745771372584/919707963688615997\n\nLink to Proposal on Notion:\nhttps://www.notion.so/juicebox/Add-drgorilla-eth-to-recurring-payout-a31dfec456174632b2e3d3e807b7dc13\n",

My main goals are: \n\n- Improve public understanding of Juicebox and DAOs in general.\n- Make Juicebox Governance sustainable—I believe the way to accomplish this is through open discourse and a well informed voter base. Automation, documentation, and simplification will be key.\n- Promote honesty, transparency, and efficiency within Juicebox DAO.\n\n### **How much do you want to earn? What else do you foresee needing from the community for you to do your best work?**\n\n$1,850 per FC (paid in Ethereum).\n\n### **What does success look like for someone taking on your role?**\n\nFor me, success will lead to:\n\n- Higher quality proposals and higher quality discourse surrounding those proposals.\n- More informed voting in the Juicebox DAO.\n- Governance and token stability as the Juicebox community grows.\n\n### **Under what criteria might it make sense for the community to reassess this payout allocation to you?**\n\nThis proposal may need to be reassessed as my contributions and commitment to the Juicebox community grow. If my focus shifts to other areas, it may become necessary to reduce or remove this recurring payout.\n\n### **Sponsors:\n[Zom_bae](https://www.notion.so/Zom_bae-7cbb9ce30379449faf73357acb5256b4) [twodam.eth](https://www.notion.so/twodam-eth-188b6f9a28dc4667b9d915fa0a379de1) [Jango](https://www.notion.so/Jango-3d619a88d22048128b2be209c4fcbcb9) [Zeugh](https://www.notion.so/Zeugh-d2e9734ddbfd432ea06098c264690162)**\n\nSee This Proposal on IPFS:\nhttps://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmXyx2mmM7yNZgmWkRpNLeUGVxWD9mBnX9HiWtGpCB43DF\n\nLink to Discussion Thread:\nhttps://discord.com/channels/775859454780244028/873248745771372584/920400093679616011\n\nLink to Proposal on Notion:\nhttps://www.notion.so/juicebox/Add-to-recurring-payout-a3e6de6c592f44f28026fc60055dca22\n",

This audit will help minimize the risk of future smart contract exploits and increase the security and reliability of the system. \n\nAfter review and negotiation with multiple potential providers, we have identified [CertiK](https://www.certik.com/) and [PeckShield](https://peckshield.com/en) as a potential provider. \n\n**Certik** is a known provider in the space and has previously conducted audits for projects such as Polygon, Bancor, Terra and The Sandbox. The company has been in operation since 2017 and has raised over $150M from various backers including Lightspeed, Tiger Global, and Coatue. \n\n**PeckShield** is a smaller company that has been working on multiple DeFi projects including Aave and Maker as well as protocols such as Harmony and Neo. While known less in the Western Hampshire, PeckShield is a known brand in Asia.\n\n### **What is this payout for?**\n\nSecurity Audit for the smart contracts located in the following Git library: ‣. The targeted start date of the audit is mid-January and the projected length is between 21 - 30 days for completion of both Audits.\n\n### **Payout Amount**\n\nTotal: $120K\n\nPeckShield: $66K ($12K paid upon agreement to reserve a slot). This was prepaid by Jango and requires an immediate refund of 3.15 ETH ([https://etherscan.io/tx/0x2291ca5b937422cfba3491117ac5b3fd20777911aadf75bd567d27e1a28529dd](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x2291ca5b937422cfba3491117ac5b3fd20777911aadf75bd567d27e1a28529dd))\n\nCertik: $54K\n\n### Payout invoice\n\nPeckShield reserve payment txn: [https://etherscan.io/tx/0xfc55a16ba647423580082bfc97f8c62f711acab78aa0a85473a94c249efbdd4e](https://etherscan.io/tx/0xfc55a16ba647423580082bfc97f8c62f711acab78aa0a85473a94c249efbdd4e) \n\n![Untitled](Juicebox%20Smart%20Contract%20Audit%203d2bb4be397b4c0ebd82a94834db1545/Untitled.png)\n\n### **What risks, drawbacks, or cons should be considered?**\n\nTwo key risks:\n\n1. Counterparty Payment - we pay to the wrong ETH address; can be mitigated by communication only through official channels with the provider\n2. Poor Performance - the Audit provider does not do a good enough job and doesn't identify potential exploits/bugs; mitigated by a secondary audit and a potential bug bounty program (bug bounty program launch proposed here:   [https://www.notion.so/juicebox/1a29a07bb815419996be81f24fef19a7?v=a317549fdf6f457b98fe787e38c3d2ae&p=18cf1b7d1c8c426fa0753163f59adbc4](https://www.notion.so/JBX-Bug-Bounty-18cf1b7d1c8c426fa0753163f59adbc4))\n\n### **Sponsors:**\n\n[Jango](https://www.notion.so/Jango-3d619a88d22048128b2be209c4fcbcb9) [twodam.eth](https://www.notion.so/twodam-eth-188b6f9a28dc4667b9d915fa0a379de1)\n\nSee This Proposal on IPFS:\nhttps://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/Qmau2xe8LkQwTLzoHKaVarG1mzJEnn9EE5bv9seJhrciUL\n\nLink to Discussion Thread:\nhttps://discord.com/channels/775859454780244028/873248745771372584/920963297795248149\n\nLink to Proposal on Notion:\nhttps://www.notion.so/juicebox/Juicebox-Smart-Contract-Audit-d668152d6ccc49d5b2fe682a0b9683bc\n\n",

      "content": "*After a trial period of 1-3 cycles, contributors are encouraged to propose a recurring role for themselves. Recurring payouts should be renewed/updated every 90 days.*\n\n### **Author:**\n\n@Exekias \n\n### **Proposal date:**\n\nDecember 16, 2021\n\n### Summary:\n\nRenew Exekias's recurring payout of $4,000 a funding cycle.\n\n### Risks:\n\n- Potentially taking funds from other contributor's that can provide more value to the DAO.\n\n### **Payout recipient:**\n\nExekias: exekias.eth\n\n### **Payout amount:**\n\n$4,000\n\n### **How have you contributed to the DAO?**\n\nI have been an instrumental member of the DAO in regards to all things dev. My core responsibilities and contributions can be summarized by the following:\n\n- Architecture: provide general consultation on architecture, design, and implementation across all dev domains (protocol, infrastructure, frontend, subgraph, etc.).\n- Devops: ensure that services are running smoothly, and that cross-domain development is  seamless.\n    - Helped mitigate Infura overload during ConstitutionDAO spike. [1]\n    - Created CI tooling that allows repository separation and seamless sharing of artifacts. [2]\n- Protocol lead: I am currently leading development of the V2 protocol alongside @Jango, primarily as it relates to quality and testing.\n    - Have provided extremely detailed code reviews of every PR against the V2 codebase. I continuously push for high quality architecture, even when it means taking the time to restructure components the right way.

I propose that the Trial Period last one funding cycle (FC#12) and that I get paid $2000 USD in ETH.\n\n### **What gaps do you see in the DAO's process, and how might you help to fill them?**\n\nFirst and foremost, I can add value in engineering. I have already made meaningful contributions to Juicebox, including:\n\n- Adding support for internationlization to the Juicebox UI ([1](https://github.com/jbx-protocol/juice-interface/pull/236)).\n- Fixing multiple non-trivial bugs ([1](https://github.com/jbx-protocol/juice-interface/pull/241), [2](https://github.com/jbx-protocol/juice-interface/pull/230)).\n- Implementing various UI features/improvements ([1](https://github.com/jbx-protocol/juice-interface/pull/231), [2](https://github.com/jbx-protocol/juice-interface/pull/254)).\n\nThe frontend workload is only going to increase, and it could be argued that it has already outsized the capacity of the current team. From my perspective, with the V2 migration looming, along with the many other future projects (for example, React component/hooks library), the frontend team needs all the help it can get.\n\nI also have an interest in technical writing (and writing in general):\n\n- I also wrote a blog post for the Juicebox blog: [https://blog.juicebox.money/dao-tooling-101/](https://blog.juicebox.money/dao-tooling-101/).\n- I overhauled the [juicebox-interface](https://github.com/jbx-protocol/juice-interface) contribution guide ([1](https://github.com/jbx-protocol/juice-interface/pull/239), [2](https://github.com/jbx-protocol/juice-interface/pull/229)).\n\nAs more folks look to contribute to Juicebox, we will need world-class documentation and dev onboarding guides, processes and tooling. These are all things I'm interested in establishing and helping mature.\n\n### **What might a starter project be for you?**\n\n- Adding AMM price of tokens https://github.com/jbx-protocol/juice-interface/issues/258\n- Available to help in implementing UI/UX improvements as needed.\n- Continue helping create the foundations for a better Juicebox developer experience, including:\n    - https://github.com/jbx-protocol/juice-interface/issues/259\n    - [Establish clearer organization and naming conventions for app files/directories](https://www.notion.so/Establish-clearer-organization-and-naming-conventions-for-app-files-directories-e72d12f9b773416d92a913c5514f75bc)\n    - [Architecture Overview](https://www.notion.so/Architecture-Overview-5208264dcc3640cb88f4d2f92f8cc11c)\n- Continue liaising with [Translation Workspace](https://www.notion.so/Translation-Workspace-e25808352c2947f983b8dc8daea093d3) to improve the translator→frontend handover\n\n### **Payout Amount:**\n\n$2000USD in ETH.\n\n### **Sponsors:**\n\n[Peri](https://www.notion.so/Peri-7732a7fcfd8e4eb688bae68941db07f0), [Zeugh](https://www.notion.so/Zeugh-d2e9734ddbfd432ea06098c264690162), [Jango](https://www.notion.so/Jango-3d619a88d22048128b2be209c4fcbcb9)\n\nSee This Proposal on IPFS:\nhttps://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmZyPCMiqeAiYJRZ1J1axT48HzukA4Ffp29iUqY712eVzs\n\nLink to Discussion Thread:\nhttps://discord.com/channels/775859454780244028/873248745771372584/919355332843667466\n\nLink to Proposal on Notion:\nhttps://www.notion.so/juicebox/Add-aeolian-eth-to-trial-payout-period-ff8265cbe9a7465baee8484499c97787\n\n",

      "content": "\n\n\n\n### **Proposal date:**\n\nDecember 14, 2021 \n\n### **Provide a comprehensive, 1-2 sentence summary of your proposal.**\n\nA payout to [twodam.eth](https://www.notion.so/twodam-eth-188b6f9a28dc4667b9d915fa0a379de1), [westlife29](https://www.notion.so/westlife29-f6a233e029724604b7584e248432b4c1), [linywan ](https://www.notion.so/linywan-dd3e1f083a5944a7a6792976439033b0), and [zhape](https://www.notion.so/zhape-d4b5c39ea4fb44319fda2ebc24488607) of $4100 USD (paid in ETH) each in exchange for Chinese-language communication and moderation between November 26, 2021 and November 30, 2021.\n\n### **What is this for?**\n\nBetween Nov 26 and Nov 30, 2021, Juicebox DAO received an unprecedented influx of Chinese language new members. Discord membership more than doubled in this four-day span. \n\nAmongst the new members, the DAO and its Discord were also subject to the first scam and spam attacks of note in the DAO's history. Misinformation included links to scam token sales of a phony JBX token on BSC and impersonator accounts on WeChat, Telegram, and Twitter.\n\nTo establish Chinese-language communication with these new DAO members and to effectively moderate the spread of misinformation and abusive content, [Jango](https://www.notion.so/Jango-3d619a88d22048128b2be209c4fcbcb9), [Zeugh](https://www.notion.so/Zeugh-d2e9734ddbfd432ea06098c264690162), and [Nicholas](https://www.notion.so/Nicholas-018dfa4125c04ad5962ae941a0d11cf1)  agreed that they would support a retroactive payout of 1 ETH to four proactive and responsible Chinese-English bilingual contributors in the early hours of Saturday, November 27, 2021. The moderation and translation support these four contributors provided in late November and early December were crucial to effectively handling the challenges posed by this unanticipated community growth event. \n\n### **Payout Amount**\n\nTotal: $16,400 USD (which is the equivalent of 4 ETH at time of writing).\n\n- $4100 USD (in ETH) to each of the following addresses:\n    - [twodam.eth](https://www.notion.so/twodam-eth-188b6f9a28dc4667b9d915fa0a379de1) at 0x29EAf8C92648B2eD71Bb8Adb09D1e071117d5218\n    - [zhape](https://www.notion.so/zhape-d4b5c39ea4fb44319fda2ebc24488607) at 0x5706d5aD7A68bf8692bD341234bE44ca7Bf2f654\n    - [linywan ](https://www.notion.so/linywan-dd3e1f083a5944a7a6792976439033b0)at 0xa0d1a6f30dB260E4D67FE20449a23E7B89537A1B\n    - [westlife29](https://www.notion.so/westlife29-f6a233e029724604b7584e248432b4c1) at 0xc29c546064e8fb5506c5e5beaf1594866df7177e\n\n### **What risks, drawbacks, or cons should be considered?**\n\nThis could establish a precedent of very large retroactive payouts. The authors believe that in this case, a payout of this size is warranted. These four contributors came in at a time when the DAO had a huge need and worked with no guarantee of compensation.\n\n### **Sponsors:**\n\n[Nicholas](https://www.notion.so/Nicholas-018dfa4125c04ad5962ae941a0d11cf1)  [Zeugh](https://www.notion.so/Zeugh-d2e9734ddbfd432ea06098c264690162) [Jango](https://www.notion.so/Jango-3d619a88d22048128b2be209c4fcbcb9) [filipv.eth](https://www.notion.so/filipv-eth-0fc06b16681e479db64e12b16908dbbf)\n\nSee This Proposal on IPFS:\nhttps://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmUhMFnAMzkTHELEggnd9mwqrwCtQKSTiwncRchJb1PhPc\n\nLink to Discussion Thread:\nhttps://discord.com/channels/775859454780244028/873248745771372584/920964487165665291\n\nLink to Proposal on Notion:\nhttps://www.notion.so/juicebox/Compensate-Chinese-Mods-for-Emergency-Moderation-7bf24cbde55f40489504e230bbbcf453\n\n\n",

      "title": "JBP-58 - Add ooyoo to trial payout period",
      "content": "### **Author:**\n\n@ooyoo \n\n### **Proposal date:**\n\nDecember 16, 2021\n\n### **Summary:**\n\nCompensate @ooyoo $2000 in exchange for work in Frontend.\n\n### Risks:\n\nThe largest risk for the DAO is the possibility that @ooyoo leaves architectural improvements in an incomplete state.\n\n*Mitigation*: Ensure work is as atomic and as discrete as possible during the trial period. Each update should not leave the code in an interim state that extends past my trial period. \n\n- For complex projects/improvements, @ooyoo will continue to document thinking before code gets written to ensure other Frontend team-members have a chance to review/critique. Context and knowledge will live in notion and across multiple teammates\n- @peri will continue to code review and ensure work/PRs are well-scoped\n\n### **Payout recipient:**\n\nooyoo.eth\n\n### **Payout amount:**\n\n$2000 USD (in eth)\n\n### How **have you already contributed to the DAO?**\n\n**Link Unfurling**  In Progress - 90% done\n\nSetup meta tags so that link-sharing unfurls with project specific information. Currently, sharing project pages leads to really confusing Juicebox-related titles and descriptions. This work required a fairly comprehensive understanding of dapp architecture and exploration of potential solutions by way of PoCs. Read more [here](https://www.notion.so/Project-Specific-Link-Unfurling-a1ef79379bdb421abd20250667b0d8e9).\n\n**Immediate Impact**\n\nProject page links will unfurl with project-specific information. Will lead to less confusion and higher click-through rates (strong guess). Urls will also have cleaner urls. (juicebox.money/#/p/constitutiondao —> juicebox.money/constitutiondao)\n\n**Longterm Impact**\n\nEstablishes cloudflare worker architecture which will allow us to get most of the benefits of web2-style traditional server side features while keeping to web3 style SPA architecture. This work establishes a pattern to do work like:\n\n- Dynamic sitemaps for SEO\n- Dynamically generating images for link unfurling\n- Edge side caching of assets/js for decreasing load times (decreasing load times has shown to lead to higher conversion rates)\n\n**Linting/formatting of FE codebase Done**\n\nI set up automated linting and formatting¹ for the frontend codebase. This was my “intro” project. This [work](https://github.com/jbx-protocol/juice-interface/pull/215) involved setting up configuration for our linters/formatters but also modifying the many places in the existing codebase that threw lint errors. After 25 comments and +904, -425 lines modified across 58 files, this time-consuming and manual work is no longer necessary because it’s now all automated! Even though this change touched a broad range of code, we did not experience any regressions/bugs in app behavior.\n\n**Immediate impact**\n\nAll frontend contributors now get the safety and consistency provided by linting and formatting. All existing code has been updated to a no lint-errors baseline.\n\n**Long term impact**\n\nOur frontend codebase can now better support more contributors - new, core and those who contribute occasionally and infrequently. \n\n**New frontend team patterns for increased visibility and deeper thought Done**\n\nI’ve suggested and put into practice a number of different ways to improve how the frontend-team brings visibility to its work.\n\n**Improved project “face”**\n\nBuilding on the work that @peri did, I updated the [Frontend Workspace](https://www.notion.so/Frontend-Workspace-26b80fcb50b34f3b9356fc7fc5286e05) page to give more visibility to new contributors and other DAO members how the Frontend team works. This is especially important for teammates that are getting onboarded. I was most excited to see @aeolian build on top of this work to bring more detail to the actual repos we work in.\n\n**Funding Cycle Recap Memo**\n\nWrote frontend’s first [FC#10 Frontend Recap](https://www.notion.so/FC-10-Frontend-Recap-1554575bd0184aa4add6221db2427c48) that was shared in #dev to give other community members a summary of the work that the frontend workspace has completed and will work on. I intend to continue to find ways to give more visibility in summarized ways to keep other areas of the DAO in the loop.\n\n**RFC Memos**\n\nEstablished a space in the Frontend Workspace to collect RFC memos for projects/multi-step tasks that require a high level of context and deep thought. See[Project Specific Link Unfurling](https://www.notion.so/Project-Specific-Link-Unfurling-a1ef79379bdb421abd20250667b0d8e9), [Adding utils/types to juice-subgraph](https://www.notion.so/Adding-utils-types-to-juice-subgraph-085d128028b541cf9773a8bf1b67de9b), and our other [memos](https://www.notion.so/10a67ffc26b141d394af5d24998e9245). \n\n### How do you want to contribute to the DAO going forward**?**\n\nIn the next cycle, I would like to:\n\n- Shepard link-unfurling across the finish line\n- Add dynamically generated images for link shares\n- Write a Roadmap RFC for juicebox-sdk². I would like this roadmap be the basis for my continued work in the DAO.\n\n### **Sponsors:**\n\n[Peri](https://www.notion.so/Peri-7732a7fcfd8e4eb688bae68941db07f0) \n\n[filipv.eth](https://www.notion.so/filipv-eth-0fc06b16681e479db64e12b16908dbbf)\n\n[Nicholas](https://www.notion.so/Nicholas-018dfa4125c04ad5962ae941a0d11cf1) \n\n---\n\n¹ A linter is a tool that catches programming errors, bugs, stylistic errors and suspicious constructs automatically - it is an important guard-rail to put in place as code-commit velocity increases. A formatter is a tool that standardizes code style and makes code easier to read. \n\n² A common pattern in the web3 world is to provide a SDK library that provides dapp developers an easy way to interact with the protocol. For example, check out uniswap’s https://github.com/Uniswap/v3-sdk (used by 463 repos), aave’s https://github.com/aave/aave-js (used by 105 repos), or zora’s https://github.com/ourzora/zdk (used by 77 repos). Juicebox should provide its own sdk by extracting core logic out of the [juicebox.money](http://juicebox.money) client. \n\n![Untitled](Add%20ooyoo%20to%20trial%20payout%20period%20271e0cc83eb44882acecaf1670cb4ba1/Untitled.png)\n \n\nSee This Proposal on IPFS:\nhttps://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmZzYcswt1YszSwwGEnYLuh6oakaZKVv8HPqVbNPx8FrYc\n\nLink to Discussion Thread:\nhttps://discord.com/channels/775859454780244028/873248745771372584/921553508367478806\n\nLink to Proposal on Notion:\nhttps://www.notion.so/juicebox/Add-ooyoo-fka-jnoh-to-trial-payout-period-19d3511653504c7db761f61c9d1c77f6\n",

Firstly, I added some clarification to the setup process of a local JB instance (https://github.com/jbx-protocol/juice-interface/pull/289). Next, I made several improvements to the reserved tokens form when creating a new project (https://github.com/jbx-protocol/juice-interface/pull/293). Finally, I compiled a site-wide list of all form-related issues ([Optimize the app's use of reactive forms/](https://www.notion.so/Optimize-the-app-s-use-of-reactive-forms-626b1ff4e1864d55973c6fe37930877a) ) which I propose I fix over my trial period.\n\n### How do you want to contribute to the DAO going forward**?**\n\nFor my trial period, I intend to complete the following tasks:\n\n- Optimize all the forms on JB ([Optimize the app's use of reactive forms/](https://www.notion.so/Optimize-the-app-s-use-of-reactive-forms-626b1ff4e1864d55973c6fe37930877a) ).\n- Add [completed translations](https://www.notion.so/Translation-Workspace-e25808352c2947f983b8dc8daea093d3) to the codebase\n\nGoing forward, I intend to focus generally on frontend bug fixes/improvements.

We got re-translation, loss of material, cycle payments equal to all translators independent of complexity and size of work and are limited to chinese and spanish. I think having someone with experience can ease the burden of managing the translations that has been falling in PM and CM and make the process flow for better results.\n\nWhat might a starter project be for you?\n\nWhat I've talked to Zotico was to use the trial period to organize the initial materials that need translation, what has already been translated and the translators we have. Organize a data base for it and to follow up on new translation demands and deliveries.\nI think that 2 weeks is enough to get the base of this in place and already deliver improvements to our process and efficiency\n\nPayout Amount:\n$500 dollars for the trial period\n\nSponsors:\nZeugh \nZótico\n\nSee This Proposal on IPFS:\nhttps://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmSfDGmYimTYgSzAJwBca5uZohenfvJ5Ynu4afmLD4mmjh\n\nLink to Discussion Thread:\nhttps://discord.com/channels/775859454780244028/916075641831571496/916810659533054023\n\nLink to Proposal on Notion:\nhttps://www.notion.so/juicebox/Bring-Zotico-in-as-Translation-Organizer-6d7c84c0f9bc433ba361844fe4a19753\n",

By now I'd say she's one of the most valuable people on helping get everything working as smoothly as possible.\nThe deeds include:\nManaging tasks in notion with new members and new projects to get everything right\n\nFollowing up on tasks with people to keep everyone accountable on their demands, ensuring that we have clear expectations on what's to happen and when\n\nPointing new contributors to the right places to get tasks done and showing them around the areas they're more connected with\n\n\nWhat role do you plan on playing in the community going forward?\n\nOutreach to newcomers and assisting with their onboarding into Juicebox and getting them setup to juice tasks.\nContinued support each focus group with task management by making sure tasks are being completed in timely manner and ensuring it's completed to the best of ones abil\nWorking with Juicers to create long and short term plans that are achievable but will also create enough value to be worth creating a task for. Setting targets for said plan to keep people moving forward\nHelp people bring the level of work and clarity of deliverables up to a high standard with a nurturing yet relentless tact. Helping set Juicy standards for the future health of the DAO.\nContinuing to improve how we as a DAO can best utilize Notion for managing tasks.\nEncourage a reasonable work/ life balance. It's important that work gets done, but if I'll also be making sure members are taking care of their mental and physical health- so everyone can provide their best work while still living their best life #WenWellness\n\nHow much do you want to earn? What else do you foresee needing from the community for you to do your best work?\n≤ $1500 per funding cycle.\nI'll need cooperation from all the \"juicers\". While generally I'm easy going, there will certainly be times I'll have to be more pushy, especially as the DAO grows and evolves.\n\nWhat does success look like for someone taking on your role?\nA thriving protocol and sound contributor ecosystem. A place where people feel welcome, productive, and appreciated for the value they're providing. When JBDAO is described as an efficient place to come in and add value.\n...and of course, more blue check boxes in Tasks to Juice ;).\n\nUnder what criteria might it make sense for the community to reassess this payout allocation to you?\n\nIf tasks aren't getting completed on time or fully completed.\n\nSponsors:\nCanu DAO \n9birdy9 \nfilipv.eth\n\nSee This Proposal on IPFS:\nhttps://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmVLzfvp4U9wzkuQtERzqqCUS11V6GfKupztdqgPyYs5cZ\n\nLink to Discussion Thread:\nhttps://discord.com/channels/775859454780244028/916815604143501352/916815926660333660\n\nLink to Proposal on Notion:\nhttps://www.notion.so/juicebox/Recurring-Payout-Pay-for-Project-Management-52c2b123373c44d9b85ae3a796159adf\n",

      "content": "Author:\nfilipv.eth\n\nProposal date:\nDecember 4, 2021\n\nProvide a comprehensive, 1-2 sentence summary of your proposal.\n\nCompensate filipv.eth $1,600 USD (in ETH) during FC#11 in exchange for further work in Governance, Community Alignment, and Visibility & Materials.\n\nWhat role have you played in the community and what have you contributed thus far?\n\nDespite being a contributor for a short time (due to the recent Government Process Amendment), I have been making strong contributions to the Juicebox community on various fronts.\nAs seen here, I have been hard at work making life easier for other Juicers and making the on-boarding process as seamless as possible by improving clarity and transparency. I am a strong believer in the values of the DAO Foundation and am doing everything in my power in order to promote those values every day across the fields of Governance, Community Alignment, and Visibility & Materials.\nWhat role do you plan on playing in the community going forward?\nProduced content (combined with recorded documentation of meetings and events) will only serve to improve public knowledge about the Juicebox protocol and DAOs in general. In the future, I would like to create a wide array of educational material that will streamline the on-boarding process and make our community more accessible to the general public.\nInternally, I will remain focused on streamlining the Governance process by updating and re-structuring throughout the Notion and working on the automation/integration of Discord and Notion.\nI will also continue my work in other areas such as Governance facilitation and documentation.\n\nHow much do you want to earn? What else do you foresee needing from the community for you to do your best work?\n\nIn order to sustainably commit to this amount of work, I would need $1,600 USD (paid in ETH) for this funding cycle. The community already provides the collaboration and support I am looking for to get my best work done, and I massively appreciate it.\n\nWhat does success look like for someone taking on your role?\nFor my role, success would mean more DAOs using the Juicebox protocol, greater public engagement with existing DAOs, and a more efficient Juicebox DAO.\n\nUnder what criteria might it make sense for the community to reassess this payout allocation to you?\n\nOver time, this payout allocation could change as I take on additional responsibilities or shift my focus towards other tasks.\n\nSponsors:\n\n\nSee This Proposal on IPFS:\nhttps://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmPYdEPLLB44rPGDhaYNTTZXRSFpXviMshPyw2FbiaDyyJ\n\nLink to Discussion Thread:\nhttps://discord.com/channels/775859454780244028/916640798374789140/916803865427443733\n\nLink to Proposal on Notion:\nhttps://www.notion.so/juicebox/Add-to-trial-period-payout-d87149fe770548238ffba532ff139891\n\n",

This causes:\nLarge and underutilized treasury\nUn-necessary token dilution for he DAO and existing token holders\n\nProposal:\nStop JBX token emission till the launch of V2 and implementation of new token mechanics\nCreate an upper bound limit to the number of JBX tokens minted every cycle\nProposed Token Mechanics:\nInitial ETH ratio\n\nLiquid market exists - based on 72 hour average of trading pair\nNo liquid market - manually set by DAO members\nIn cycle ratio increase\n\n\nUp to cycle funding target - Till the cycle funding target is met all ETH ratio will be maintained at the pre-set\nAbove cycle funding target - Every 2x increase in funding, the ETH ratio increases by XX% (variable that can be set by the DAO)\nNumerical example:\n\n\nInitial funding target: 10 ETH. Initial ratio: 1 eth to 100 JBX ETH\nUp to 10 ETH - mint 1000 JBX\nDAO elects for a 20% increase ratio\nNext 10 ETH - mint based on a ratio of 0.012 JBX:ETH ratio\nNext 20 ETH (double of total funding thus far) - mint based on a ratio of 0.0144 JBX:ETH ratio\n\nPLEASE SEE FULL PROPOSAL VIA LINKS BELOW TO SEE GRAPHIC\n\nProject payments to JBX: included with the all types of funding\n\n\nProjects are paying JBX for contract usage, in most cases (ETH) any project using ETH is not getting anything in return, in the case of JBX, the platform incentivizes projects by providing them with JBX tokens\nProjects are paying JBX for contract usage, in most cases (ETH) any project using ETH is not getting anything in return, in the case of JBX, the platform incentivizes projects by providing them with JBX tokens\nAll tokens received by projects are subject to a 1Y lockup (can't sell)\nWhat it creates:\nLiquid market <> minting mechanics - the market will find an equilibrium between liquid markets and minting\nEarly contributors to the treasury and adopters of the protocol are rewarded not just between cycles, but also within cycle\n\n\nSee This Proposal on IPFS:\nhttps://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/Qmd6q35RhjtFyUfg13TRSU7kwueakbKxAJBgJgxQPtDhPJ\n\nLink to Discussion Thread:\nhttps://discord.com/channels/775859454780244028/914218359623667802\n\nLink to Proposal on Notion:\nhttps://www.notion.so/juicebox/JBX-Token-Mechanics-f08e3c5d12e4425a9d83b7f06b9210ff\n\n",

This payout includes a retroactive payout of INSERT FIGURE for work completed as cn-mod in Discord and as a Chinese translator since DATE. This payout also includes a payout of INSERT FIGURE for the upcoming funding cycle period.\n\nWhat gaps do you see in the DAO's process, and how might you help to fill them?\n\nDue to the language gap, Juicebox discord, website and related content needs to be translated to Chinese so that the Chinese-language community can better understand the Juicebox protocol and JuiceboxDAO. In-time and precise translation as well as patient explanations should be helpful to smooth things out.\n\nWhat might a starter project be for you?\nMy two main goals for the upcoming period are to continue moderating the Discord's Chinese language channels and to translate crucial protocol and DAO documents, prioritizing Governance, Tokenomics, and Protocol mechanisms, as those are the subjects I see Chinese discord members most often confused about. I will work with Zótico, the proposed translation organizer, to facilitate high quality and timely Chinese translations of protocol and DAO resources.\n\nPayout Amount:\n$600/FC\nSponsors:\n\nSee This Proposal on IPFS:\nhttps://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmXcg7QhbfnCDeTtzhTBG5iJPTWsfUbBJP3hxEfMmJkVnT\n\nLink to Discussion Thread:\nhttps://discord.com/channels/775859454780244028/916482987812601876/916814093762035782\n\nLink to Proposal on Notion:\nhttps://www.notion.so/juicebox/Add-zhape-to-a-trial-payout-period-57a290114b234a5092d2d3b3bf82c5e6\n",

What else do you foresee needing from the community for you to do your best work?\n\nFor this project, $750 USD (in JBX) per funding cycle to 0xSTVG and filipv.eth each in order to pay for producing and coordinating of guests as well as for pre and post production.\n\nWhat does success look like for someone taking on your role?\nThis podcast and Twitter AMA would serve to bring the Juicebox protocol to a wider audience, both through distribution on social media and increased public understanding of the Juicebox protocol and DAO concepts. In practice, this will cause new projects to be created with the Juicebox protocol and drive increased public engagement with existing projects.\n\nUnder what criteria might it make sense for the community to reassess this payout allocation to you?\n\nIn the future, further funding could be needed to increase episode frequency or for related promotion on social media/creating promotional content.\n\nSponsors:\n\n\n\nSee This Proposal on IPFS:\nhttps://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmcoUzS4FxpKfiJDaZYec9yc4S3eiAoNiXop61A8Cv4dHL\n\nLink to Discussion Thread:\nhttps://discord.com/channels/775859454780244028/916097881381933076/916805899014766673\n\nLink to Proposal on Notion:\nhttps://www.notion.so/juicebox/Produce-Juicebox-Podcast-aa2f92f5ffc545e28fd7bff6964ca33d",

My main focus will initially be unit testing and overall optimization.\nI suggest a duration of one funding cycle and a payout of $1000 (or $JBX equivalent), based on my last hiring coding challenge (with a payout of 3700$), past salary/industry standards  and \"earn a comparatively small amount\".\n\n**What gaps do you see in the DAO's process, and how might you help to fill them?**\n\nEven though the Juicebox V2 code base is already functional and well written, with an exhaustive and clear documentation, more hands on the keyboard are always welcomed. In order to have a proper audit by the end of the year, the solidity code needs to be thoroughly tested, challenged and optimized where it can be.\n\nFurthermore, to facilitate our future auditor's life, having reviewed and covered every corner of the code base (and document it as needed) is a necessity.\nSince my arrival at JB yesterday, I have coded a first draft of unit tests for one of the Core contracts JBSplitStore https://github.com/drgorillamd/juice-contracts-v2/commit/cc9f38999d1e46ef600443a9adc11d3c71cc5aec.\n\nAnother gap I would like to help addressing at Juicebox DAO is the gap in newcomers formal trial procedure (especially for developers). As I currently have a conflict of interest in this one, I would like to start thinking of other ways to achieve such trial (ie coding challenge for instance), after my own trial period ends.\n\n \n**What might a starter project be for you?**\n\nWrite unit tests while finding potential gas optimization.\n\nTrial period outcome (recurring versus not) will be assessed based on : \n\n- Overall ability to assimilate the V2 code base\n- Quality of code delivered\n- Ability to receive and implement feedback\n- Ability to review own and other's code (unit tests and code base), providing relevant comments\n\n**Payout Amount:**\n\nSuggested: 1000$ (ideally in $JBX, in order to serve as an entry and incentive to take an active part in DAO voting process), **if** the trial period leads to further collaboration (via another trial period or a recurring payout, which would be in $ETH).\n\n**Sponsors:**\n\n@Jango \n\n\nSee this proposal on IPFS \nipfs://QmNYdy4QAYiw7BmLxaKVsnPLqn9A1zN8hZ6ktNVmPvAgY4/Add%20DrGorilla%20eth%20to%20trial%20period%20payout.md\nIPFS Gateway\nhttps://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmNYdy4QAYiw7BmLxaKVsnPLqn9A1zN8hZ6ktNVmPvAgY4/Add%20DrGorilla%20eth%20to%20trial%20period%20payout.md",

      "content": "Date: November 21, 2021\nTags: reconfiguration, treasury\n\n**Author:** \n@peri \n\n**Payout recipient:**\n@peri \n\n**Proposal date:**\nNovember 24, 2021 \n\n**Provide a comprehensive, 1-2 sentence summary of your proposal.**                                                                            \nCompensate @peri for spending on app infrastructure services, and allocate funding toward future spending.\n\n**What is this payout for?**\nThe Juicebox app currently depends on these services:\n\n- **Infura** - Used to send JSONRPC requests, necessary to call contracts on Ethereum.\n- **Fleek** - Deploys new versions of the app to IPFS. Provides a DNS gateway with SSL.\n- **BlockNative** - Enables connecting an Ethereum wallet to the app, and reports the status of sent transactions.\n- **TheGraph** - Indexes events on Ethereum and makes data accessible over HTTPS.\n\nUntil recently, the cost of these services have been negligible and paid by @peri. With the recent surge in app usage following the launch of ConstitutionDAO, costs have increased, making it necessary to offload spending for these to the DAO.\n\nThis proposal has two parts:\n\n1) Compensate @peri for the costs of the most recent billing period, outlined below:\n\n- Infura: $12,847.94 / 2.95 ETH (per month)\n- TheGraph billing balance: 5K GRT / 1.08 ETH (running balance)\n- Fleek: $200 / 0.04 ETH (per month)\n\n**Total: 4.07 ETH**\n\n2) Move 6.7 ETH to the multisig to be used as follows:\n\n- **Move 4.5 ETH to an Infura billing balance.** Due to Infura's willingness to customize our billing strategy, costs will decrease in the future from the recent billing period, however we won't know an exact number until next month. I estimate a decrease of at least 50%, in which case 4.5 ETH will cover at least 3 months of spending on Infura.\n- **Convert 2 ETH to roughly 10,000 GRT and to be deposited into the Graph billing balance.** During the week of the ConstitutionDAO surge, 2,100 GRT was spent on query costs—while previously costs were on average 15 GRT per week. Accounting for an overall increase in queries due to growth, and 1 similar sized surge each month, this balance should last for at least 3 months.\n- **Move 0.2 ETH to our Fleek billing balance.** At $200/mo, this should cover at least 3 months of Fleek services.\n\n**Payout Amount** \n\n10.77 ETH\n\n**What risks, drawbacks, or cons should be considered?**\n\nDetails on funding Infura with ETH still haven't been fully communicated. If we were to stop using Infura before the billing balances were spent, it's possible there may be difficulties in refunding our ETH. However, the billing balance in the Graph can be withdrawn any time.\n\n**Sponsors:**\nJango, Nicholas\n\n\n### See this proposal on IPFS \nipfs://QmNYdy4QAYiw7BmLxaKVsnPLqn9A1zN8hZ6ktNVmPvAgY4/App%20Infrastructure%20Spending.md\n\n### IPFS Gateway\nhttps://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmNYdy4QAYiw7BmLxaKVsnPLqn9A1zN8hZ6ktNVmPvAgY4/App%20Infrastructure%20Spending.md",

This sum is derived from my previous full-time compensation of 7000 USDC per month + options. Initially, I will be committing around 25% of my time to the protocol, but as my knowledge and expertise grow, I will increase my contributions according to the DAO's needs.\n\n**What gaps do you see in the DAO's process, and how might you help to fill them?**\n\nI can do many things, and have nice understanding of space, so very exited to help take this protocol to the 🚀 . I have started building the dune dashboard for the protocol ([https://dune.xyz/wijuwiju/Juicebox](https://dune.xyz/wijuwiju/Juicebox)), and I have been chipping away at some tasks for the Juicebox interface already ([https://github.com/jbx-protocol/juice-interface/graphs/contributors](https://github.com/jbx-protocol/juice-interface/graphs/contributors))!\n\n**What might a starter project be for you?**\n\nI will continue to work on improving the website interface and dune dashboard.

Although we have only just begun transitioning task management to the Workspace, it is already apparent that important recurring tasks across a variety of Focus Areas are at risk of being forgotten, given the few contributor-hours available to complete them. As Juicebox grows in popularity, achieving these Community Management, Governance, and Protocol Development tasks becomes crucial to the viability of the protocol and the healthy decentralization of the DAO. \n\nIn order to enable builders of all stripes to focus on their respective domains, it would be pertinent at this stage of the DAOs development to engage a project manager who can focus on an overview of the DAOs operations. \n\n@Zom_Bae_ has offered to take on a project management role. Prior to this proposal, Zom has already taken it upon herself to speak with individual contributors to understand the DAOs contributor-composition. She has also begun to coordinate meetings and facilitate task completion and contributor onboarding across a variety of Discord channels. \n\n**What might a starter project be for you?**\nI propose that Zom_Bae_ be added to the Spending roster for project management work because I believe this is a crucial function that is currently handled by all contributors in addition to their specific roles, to the detriment of their focus and the DAOs good functioning. I believe that Zom_Bae_ has the social skills and focus to keep tasks from falling through the cracks, while her clear thinking and collaborative spirit will help her to refine and build new processes that increase contributor happiness and output. \n\nI believe that the trial period payout's success should be evaluated based on Zom's ability to improve contributor coordination and task completion. If the trial period is successful, I hope that the DAO will see fit to increase Zom's payout and introduce her to the Recurring Spending roster.\n\n**Payout Amount:**\n$600\n\n**Sponsors:**\nNicholas\n\n\n## See this proposal on IPFS\nipfs://QmNYdy4QAYiw7BmLxaKVsnPLqn9A1zN8hZ6ktNVmPvAgY4/Payout%20Trial%20Pay%20@Zom_bae%20for%20Project%20Management.md\n\n## IPFS Gateway\nhttps://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmNYdy4QAYiw7BmLxaKVsnPLqn9A1zN8hZ6ktNVmPvAgY4/Payout%20Trial%20Pay%20@Zom_bae%20for%20Project%20Management.md",

Specifically, I have completed and presented research on governance, created accessibility for governance information on docs, and created docs for the onboarding process.\n\n**What role do you plan on playing in the community going forward?**\n\nGoing forward, I would like to take the lead on the governance project.\n\n**How much do you want to earn? What else do you foresee needing from the community for you to do your best work?**\n\nI would like to earn $500 weekly. In order to do my best work, I need active participation from the community on governance issues as well as honest feedback from community members about how they feel I am doing in my role.\n\n**What does success look like for someone taking on your role?**\n\nIn my book, the tasks of the lead governance position can be broken down into three parts. First is facilitation. In order to create an authentic decentralized form of governance, there needs to be constant conversation and speculation of which the lead governance position can facilitate. The second part, is research. In order for a community to make an accurate decision, they need to be well informed of different governance options and to be presented with stimulating ideas. The final task is just general accessibility to governance information by keeping the community updated on what we have done so far (docs etc).\n\n**Under what criteria might it make sense for the community to reassess this payout allocation to you?**\n\nThe community should reassess payments to me if progress towards a decentralized form of governance is lost and if there is a lack of circulation of governance ideas focused on community betterment.\n\n",

All project reconfigurations made during this week will require no fees from their payouts for the lifetime of that configuration.\n\nThis allows the DAO to further experiment with group bidding projects happening on Juicebox who otherwise are too inconvenienced by a payout fee to use the protocol for fundraising at all. \n\nThis is a temporary solution that allows more projects to experiment on Juicebox. Future versions of Juicebox should strive for a fee structure that better accommodates all projects.\n\nDownsides: \n- Some loss revenue. \n- Shifts some expectations which might cause confusing. \n- Kicks an important broader question down the road of how JB should manage fees for project dynamics.\n\nSee the full discussion on Discord, starting here: https://discord.com/channels/775859454780244028/873248745771372584/883187269949882448",
