      "title": "GCP #9: Referral Program",
      "content": "### Summary/Proposal\n\nTo promote the growth and expansion of the GCR Community, we propose implementing a referral program, whereby existing members can reduce the carry for deals through successful referrals.\n\n### Motivation\n\nDue to the confidential nature of the deals we engage in at GCR, the active promotion of these deals is not feasible. As a result, an effective method to circulate information about both GCR and the exclusive deals we offer is through referrals. It is imperative that we incentivize this behavior among our existing members, motivating them to participate in expanding the GCR Community.\n\n\n### Specification\n\nMembers can choose to refer people to GCR to reduce the carry that they are charged on a deal that they participate in.\n\n**Link to calculate**: [GCR Referrals](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1APh3I_qnM7ndo5JvKIiZxfgnQfH6QcTET8gdrVeOSOg/edit#gid=0)\n\n#### **Example 1**\n_(Investment Amount: 5,000; Carry Reduction: 2%)_\n\n[GCR Referrals_eg1](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QwDPtrhicKV4y4dPx2oTWTmY2xMGLPiKVAq3zHQubtg/edit#gid=0) \n\nIn this example, a GCR member intends to invest $5,000 in a deal and desires a 2% carry reduction. To qualify for this reduction, the member must refer either two individuals with Gold memberships or one person with a Gold Pro membership.\n\n#### **Example 2**\n_(Investment Amount: 10,000; Carry Reduction: 4%)_\n\nIn this example, a GCR member intends to invest $10,000 in a deal and desires a 4% carry reduction. To qualify for this reduction, the member must refer either four individuals with Gold memberships or two individuals with a Gold Pro membership.\n\n[GCR Referrals_eg2](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ZG-mpsajeWowkpX8aUAZ9_od1IGMaGpNC6Efvg1ZJyE/edit#gid=0)\n\n#### **Example 3**\n_(Investment Amount: 15,000; Carry Reduction: 2%)_\n\nIn this example, a GCR member intends to invest $15,000 in a deal and desires a 2% carry reduction. To qualify for this reduction, the member must refer either four individuals with Gold memberships or two individuals with a Gold Pro membership.\n\n[GCR Referrals_eg3](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hzQsNjAttK8Vk5e4ZuJ6f8o_suk_QK_fqUy_N70JVZk/edit#gid=0)\n\n_It's important to note that the referred individuals need to make a successful minimum investment in any GCR deal for the referral to be eligible for the carry reduction._\n\n#### Steps for Carry Reduction via the Referral Program:\n\n1. Participants can reduce their carry by 1% to 4% max per deal, in 1% increments, similar to [GCP #7 - Burn $GCR Tokens for Carry Reduction.](https://snapshot.org/#/globalcoinresearch.eth/proposal/0x352b7b6c2e2a90f48da17d569fbfe7a7490b7dfb85a8b5b3bc085bcd7b3b7c05)\n2. Participants will need to enter their desired investment amount and carry reduction in this sheet [GCR Referrals](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1APh3I_qnM7ndo5JvKIiZxfgnQfH6QcTET8gdrVeOSOg/edit#gid=0) to determine the # of referrals required.\n3. Participants will have to fill out [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf7bFDWnRrZogiY9ws6GIEfi9af7Ro7Ke6C8gVv_VJ4PEn86Q/viewform) to submit their referral entry.\n\n_The GCR Core Team will determine the validity of each entry and whether it has already been utilized for carry reduction._\n\n### FAQ\n**1. Why is there a need for a referral program?**\n\nHaving more members in the GCR Community through a referral program will increase the likelihood of deals getting filled and will position us to secure more deals.\n\n**2. What's the max carry a member can reduce with referrals + burn?**\n\nThe maximum carry reduction percentage a member can receive per deal is 4%, **whether through the referral program, the burn program, or a combination of both.**\n\nE.g. if a member has made enough # of referrals to qualify for a 4% carry reduction in a deal, they would no longer have the option to additionally decrease their carry by utilizing GCR tokens (through other programs), and vice versa.\n\n**3. When does a member’s carry reduction through burn or referral get finalized?**\n\nThe carry percentage for a deal gets finalized at the time of investing in a deal.\n\n\n### Vote:\nThe ‘Single choice voting’ Snapshot voting system will be used for this proposal, meaning each voter must hold at least 1 GCR token to be able to vote and may select only one choice:\n\nYes - Approve the proposal\nNo - Decline the proposal",

      "title": "GCP #8: Launching GCRx - A Software Venture and Spin-Off from GCR",
      "content": "### Summary/Proposal\n\nCurrently, GCR DAO operates as a comprehensive community, managing a wide range of tasks from sourcing and investing in Web3 deals to conducting research, marketing, and building internal tools. This proposal aims to establish GCRx, a separate company spin-off from GCR DAO, with a focus on building a technology platform to enable communities to invest together. The goal of the company is to enable other communities to invest together by leveraging GCR's successful investing practices and brand.\n\n### Motivation\n\nSince the DAO’s establishment, GCR has become one of the most recognizable brands in the Investment DAO space. In the last three years, the DAO has deployed over $41M in capital as a DAO and invested in over 65 projects including Lens Protocol, Sweatcoin, Aurora, Mysten Labs (Sui), LayerZero, and Magic Eden.\n\nGCR DAO is mostly full-time crypto professionals ranging from Union Square Ventures investing team members, to Arca, Polygon, NEAR, and other ecosystem executives, and the members have span across the globe to form a formidable community worldwide.\n\nNow, the motivation behind the creation of the software company, GCRx and this proposal, will allow us to take the GCR brand further. Nevertheless, there needs to be a separate entity established because of the following:\n\n- The GCR brand will be symbiotic across GCRx and future brands the DAO incubates. By separating from the DAO, different organizations can run independently with different structures.\n- Establishing a separate software company enables these entities to raise capital independently in a more fitting legal structure, providing the company with more resources for growth and development.\n- The separation would reduce the financial burn of the DAO by about one-third, extending the DAO’s operational runway.\n- This separation would allow the DAO to focus more on decentralization and meeting the needs and interests of the community.\n- The spin-off would have more operational freedom. While the GCR community would benefit from further decentralization and proposal-driven decision-making, the software team requires agile and opinionated work from full-time builders for efficient software development.\n\n### Details on GCRx\n\nThe goal of GCRx (temp name) is to build a technology platform to enable communities to invest together. Many of kickstarting the company has begun and below are the details for launching the company into a completely independent but synergistic entity:\n\n- Establish a C-Corp for GCRx and have it be a standalone company.\n- Join the OrangeDAO accelerator in July-September of 2023, which would fund GCRx with some initial capital.\n- Spin out the team and divide members into either GCRx-only or to receive payroll from both GCR DAO and GCRx should the member continue to work on both. Continue to ramp up hiring for GCRx based on the company’s needs and runway.\n- Explore further fundraising and monetization opportunities leveraging GCR’s brand and community in the next 3-5 months.\n\n### Benefits for GCR DAO and $GCR Token\n\nThe establishment of the C-Corp, GCRx, would bring several benefits directly to the DAO.\n- The proposed restructuring would extend the DAO's operational runway from approximately 10 months to over 14 months.\n- GCR will retain 25% of ownership and shareholders in the new company.\n- GCRx would focus on creating software products that expand the use case of the $GCR token, support the treasury, and initiate other projects to continue the success of GCR.\n- One of the board seats of GCRx would be occupied by the GCR DAO Core Team, ensuring representation and alignment of interests.\n- Once capitalized over a certain threshold, GCRx would purchase a series of $GCR tokens at a pre-determined price. These tokens would be held on GCRx's balance sheet to further align the new entity with the GCR DAO.\n\n### Vote:\nThe ‘Single choice voting’ Snapshot voting system will be used for this proposal, meaning each voter must hold at least 1 GCR token to be able to vote and may select only one choice:\n\nYes - Approve the proposal\nNo - Decline the proposal",

      "title": "GCP #7 - Burn $GCR Tokens for Carry Reduction",
      "content": "### Summary/Proposal ###\n\nTo improve $GCR tokenomics and more closely align the value of $GCR with the amount and quality of deals that GCR does, we propose a token burn mechanism whereby users can choose to burn $GCR tokens to reduce the carry that they are charged on a deal.\n\n\n### Motivation ###\n\nAs of now, $GCR tokenomics are very one-sided. On the demand side, $GCR tokens represent a one-time purchase that a user makes to become a member. Beyond that the only other utility that $GCR has is for governance voting. On the supply side, however, as with most DAOs, the $GCR token is an important resource to help fund DAO expenses. We need to introduce a token utility to $GCR that will help balance supply and demand - ideally one that is related to the success of the DAO’s activities.\n\n### Specification ###\nUsers can choose to burn $GCR tokens to reduce that carry that they are charged on a deal that they participate in.\n\n###### Example: ######\nThere is an opportunity to participate in a private deal through GCR. Alice, a GCR member, decides to invest $5,000 into the deal.\n\nIn the current paradigm, to participate in the deal, Alice pays:\n- $5,000 USDC, her investment amount\n- +$250 USDC Ops fee\n\nAfter the deal is funded, a minimum of 15% carry is charged on Alice’s investment. (Remember that in the case where the deal returns >15x, the carry charge increases to 25%)\n\nOnce the proposal is passed, Alice has the option to burn an additional amount of $GCR tokens to reduce the carry that she is charged. The carry reduction is equal to ½ the amount of $GCR tokens burned up to a maximum carry reduction of 4%. To reduce the carry by 1%, 2% of the initial investment needs to be burned. Alice would decide to do this if she believes that the deal that she is participating in will generate at least a 2x multiple.\n\nUnder this paradigm, Alice pays:\n- $5,000 USDC, her investment amount\n- +$250 USDC Ops fee\n- $100 worth of $GCR to be burned (2% of her investment amount in order to reduce her carry by 1%)\n\nAs a result, the minimum carry she is charged is reduced to 14% (down from 15%). In the case where the deal returns >15x, the carry would increase to 24% (down from 25%).\n\n###### To recap: ######\n - The decision to burn an additional amount in $GCR to reduce the carry charge is optional, not required.\n- The ratio of $GCR burned to carry reduction is 2:1.\n- Participants can reduce their carry by 1% to 4% max, in 1% increments.\n- To determine the # of $GCR tokens burned, we use the prior month’s 30-day VWAP based on CoinGecko’s historical data.\n- Users purchase the correct amount of $GCR tokens and send it to the same Gnosis Safe for deal funding. Once the deal is funded, the $GCR tokens are sent to a burn address.\n\nThis is considered V1 of this proposal. V2 may include an auction mechanism where deal participants can blind bid on how much they are willing to burn in order to reduce their carry. This would allow for market forces to determine the ratio of $GCR token burn vs carry reduction instead of a static 2:1 ratio.\n\n### Additional Consideration: ###\n\nThere will be a 1-time 90-day window from when the proposal is passed for members to retroactively opt into a $GCR token burn under the same specifications above to reduce carry for previously funded deals.\n\n\n### Vote ###\n\nThe ‘Single choice voting’ Snapshot voting system will be used for this proposal, meaning each voter must hold at least 1 GCR token to be able to vote and may select only one choice:\n\nYes - Approve the proposal\nNo - Decline the proposal",

      "title": "GCP #6: Revised Token Investments Carry Economics",
      "content": "### Summary/Proposal ###\n\nPer GCP #4, on each investment that GCR does, the GCR investment vehicle currently charges 10% carried interest (”Carry”) as an incentive fee.\n\nWith this new proposal (GCP #6), we propose a new carry of 15% for all GCR investments. For GCR investments that have generated >15x return, we propose a carry of 25%.\n\nCarry will be distributed to the contributors involved in all GCR community investments going forward. The three broad categories of contributor roles will be Deal Scout, Deal Lead, and Operations Lead.\n\nAs a reminder, this carry definition will apply to investments that exit in the form of token distributions. Carry stands for the percentage of the investment exit value of the token investments that the GCR community invests in.\n\n\n### Motivation ###\n\nTo date, GCR has successfully invested in and supported numerous projects within the Web 3.0 ecosystem with superior returns. With this new proposal, we want to re-create a framework that will benefit GCR community and contributors / partners who were involved in the investment process.\n\n### Specification ###\n\n#### Definition of Carry ####\n\nFor token investments, carry is simply calculated as a percentage of the investment exit value. For example, on a $100 investment that becomes $1,000 at the exit, 15% carry on this will be $150.\n\n#### Calculation of Investment Return ####\n\nInvestment returns will be calculated based on the distribution cadence: if the distribution happens every quarter, investment return for the deal is calculated based on a trailing 3-month volume-weighted average price (VWAP).\n\nFor the VWAP calculation, we would take the average of the ‘open’ and ‘close’ prices for each day:\n\nQuarterly Investment Return = \n90-Day VWAP / initial investment token price - 1\n\n#### Deal Contributor Role Categories ####\n\n#### All Investments (15.0% carry) ####\n\nDeal Scout: $2500 in $GCR tokens (0% carry distribution share).\nTo qualify for this compensation, Deal Scout should at the minimum do the following: (i) secure an investment allocation amount (minimum of $100k) for the GCR community; and (ii) manage the relationship with the project pre-investment. NOTE: As an additional benefit, if the Deal Scout chooses to invest in the deal, they are exempt from the 15% carry costs.\n\nDeal Lead: 4.5% carry distribution share.\nTo qualify for this share, Deal Lead should at the minimum do the following: (i) conduct due diligence on the project (e.g. leading the deal call, taking notes, etc.); (ii) manage communications within the GCR community; (iii) support the project post-investment and manage the angel network (carry to be split with contributors within the angel network); and (iv) manage the team responsible for active management of investment proceeds in GCR Treasury.\n\nOperations Lead: 1.5% carry distribution share.\nTo qualify for this share, Operations Lead should at the minimum manage the back-end processes behind the investment that include: (i) setting up the investment vehicle; (ii) confirming allocations and securing funds from GCR community members; (iii) legal and tax work; and (iv) distributing the funds.\n\n\n\n#### Investments >15x return (25.0% carry) ####\n\nDeal Scout: $2500 in $GCR tokens & 1.0% carry distribution share.\nTo qualify for this compensation, Deal Scout should at the minimum do the following: (i) secure an investment allocation amount (minimum of $100k) for the GCR community; and (ii) manage the relationship with the project pre-investment. NOTE: As an additional benefit, if the Deal Scout chooses to invest in the deal, they are exempt from the 25% carry costs.\n\nDeal Lead: 7.0% carry distribution share.\nTo qualify for this share, Deal Lead should at the minimum do the following: (i) conduct due diligence on the project (e.g. leading the deal call, taking notes, etc.); (ii) manage communications within the GCR community; (iii) support the project post-investment and manage the angel network (carry to be split with contributors within the angel network); and (iv) manage the team responsible for active management of investment proceeds in GCR Treasury.\n\nOperations Lead: 2.0% carry distribution share.\nTo qualify for this share, Operations Lead should at the minimum manage the back-end processes behind the investment that include: (i) setting up the investment vehicle; (ii) confirming allocations and securing funds from GCR community members; (iii) legal and tax work; and (iv) distributing the funds.\n\n\nBroadly speaking, these three roles represent the beginning, middle, and end of an investment. The Deal Scout initiates, the Deal Lead conducts diligence, and the Operations Lead manages the back-end execution. Deal Lead will also work with the angel network to support portfolio companies post-investment. The details around the roles and the enforcement thereof are subject to change based on the Core Team’s learnings from ongoing developments.\n\nIt will become a standard requirement for all GCR investment vehicles to pledge carry to the Deal Scout, Deal Lead and Operations Lead as per this proposal.\n\nThis new carry framework will apply to future investments that occur post this proposal.\n\n\n### Vote ###\n\nThe ‘Single choice voting’ Snapshot voting system will be used for this proposal, meaning each voter must hold at least 1 GCR token to be able to vote and may select only one choice:\n\nYes - Approve the proposal\nNo - Decline the proposal\n",

      "content": "Author: theIntuitiveQ#9584, TheJinKang#2753\nStart Date: 2/7/2022 1PM ET\nEnd Date: 2/8/2022 5PM ET\n\n# **Summary**\n\nIn the context of GCR’s Treasury diversification and investment optimization, we present a diversification strategy of allocating $100,000 to the purchase of crypto coins after the significant sell-off during the months from November until the present date.\n\n\n# **Motivation**\n\nAfter the considerable sell-off that was likely triggered by a change in the macroeconomic backdrop with financial markets pricing in a more hawkish monetary policy pursued by the Federal Reserve, major crypto assets currently trade at around 50% (or more) below their respective ATH.\n\nWe propose the purchase of $100,000 Layer 1 coins to benefit from comparably attractive entry levels in the broader crypto market. Furthermore, acknowledging market volatility potentially to pertain in the next couple of months, we propose to implement the ETH leg of the trade in the form of Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA). The main reason why we will not implement the other coins with the DCA method is the lack of automation tools for coins outside the Ethereum chain.\n\n\n# **Specification**\n\n1. Purchase a $100,000 portfolio with following allocation:\na.      $55,000 ETH\nb.      $15,000 SOL\nc.      $15,000 AVAX\nd.      $15,000 NEAR\n\n2. Implementation strategies:\na.      DCA for ETH with 5 monthly purchases of $11,000 each, concluding the trade in mid-June\nb.      One-off purchase SOL, AVAX, NEAR after affirmative Community vote\n\n# **Vote**\n\nThe ‘Single choice voting’ Snapshot voting system will be used for this proposal, meaning each voter must hold at least 1 GCR token to be able to vote and may select only one choice:\n\nYes - Approve the purchase and implementation of the crypto portfolio outlined above\nNo - Reject the purchase and implementation of the crypto portfolio outlined above",

      "content": "### Summary/Proposal ###\n\nWe propose to distribute 5% of the carried interest (”Carry”) to the Contributors involved in any GCR community investments completed to date and those going forward.\nThe three broad categories of Contributor roles will be the Deal Sourcer, Deal Lead, and Operations Lead. Currently, on each investment that GCR does, the GCR investment vehicle charges 10% carry as an incentive fee. Carry stands for the percentage of the investment exit value of the token investments that the GCR community invests in; this carry definition only applies to token investments.\n\n### Motivation ###\n\nTo date, GCR has invested in and supported numerous projects within the Web 3.0 ecosystem.\nWith this proposal, we aim to create a framework that will fairly distribute the carry across the contributors/partners who helped facilitate the investment.\n\n### Specification ###\n\n#### Definition of Carry ####\n\nCarry is simply calculated as a percentage of the investment exit value on GCR token investments.\nFor example, on a $100 investment that becomes $1,000 at the exit, 10% carry on this will be $100.\n\n#### Deal Contributor Role Categories ####\n\nDeal Sourcer: 2.0% carry distribution share. To qualify for this share, Deal Sourcer should at the minimum do the following: (i) secure an investment allocation amount for the GCR community; and (ii) manage the relationship with the project pre-investment. NOTE: As an additional benefit, if the Deal Sourcer chooses to invest in the deal, they are exempt from the 10% carry costs.\n\nDeal Lead: 1.5% carry distribution share. To qualify for this share, Deal Lead should at the minimum do the following: (i) conduct due diligence on the project (e.g. leading the deal call, taking notes, etc.); (ii) manage communications within the GCR community; (iii) support the project post-investment; and (iv) manage the team responsible for active management of investment proceeds in GCR Treasury.\n\nOperations Lead: 1.5% carry distribution share. To qualify for this share, Operations Lead should at the minimum manage the back-end processes behind the investment that include: (i) setting up the investment vehicle; (ii) confirming allocations and securing funds from GCR community members; (iii) legal and tax work; and (iv) distributing the funds.\n\nBroadly speaking, these three roles represent the beginning, middle, and end of an investment. The Deal Sourcer initiates, the Deal Lead conducts diligence, and the Operations Lead conducts the back-end execution. The details around the roles and the enforcement thereof are subject to change based on the Core Team’s learnings from ongoing developments.\n\nIt will become a standard requirement for all GCR investment vehicles to pledge carry to the Deal Sourcer, Deal Lead and Ops Lead as per this proposal.\n\nThis new carry framework will apply to the following investments completed to date and future investments.\n\n#### Previous investments made to date include: ####\nStructure Finance\nCoinvise\nDystopia\nMatrix\nTracer\nOrca\nApollo\nVerto\nManta\nParcel\nNifty Comedians\nAurora\nEndemic\nRuby\nRawbots\nHedgey\nTalent Protocol\nSolchicks\nSocialstack\nConvo Space\nStartupy\nSismo\nSweatcoin\nPassage\nGood Ghosting\n\n### Vote ###\n\nThe ‘Single choice voting’ Snapshot voting system will be used for this proposal, meaning each voter must hold at least 1 GCR token to be able to vote and may select only one choice:\n\nYes - Approve the proposal\nNo - Decline the proposal\n",
