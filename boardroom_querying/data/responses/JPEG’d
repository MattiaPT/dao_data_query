      "content": "## Abstract\n\nIn an effort to be more forgiving for those who have not migrated JPEG to JPGD, migration this proposal aims to allow migration after 10/31/24 and introduce a 10% penalty.\n\n## Background\n\nPIP 92 introduced an end to the migration of JPEG to JPGD by 10/31/2024. \n\nThis proposal amends PIP-92 and changes the hard-stop to a 10% penalty incurred by late migrators. Extra tokens held in the migration contract will be returned to the treasury.\n\nThe migration contract also holds a token amount related to the initial JPEG airdrop. This proposal suggests to end the airdrop claiming and to remove the JPGD related to the airdrop claiming from the migration contract. As such, after 10/31/2024, any unclaimed and non-migrated JPEG related to this airdrop will be returned to the treasury. \n\n## Specifications\n\n- JPEG to JPGD migration will continue after 10/31/24 and incur a 10% penalty after this date.\n- Update the exchange rate for migration to 1 JPEG = 1.2964563526 JPGD\n- The excess JPGD held in the migration contract (0x7be03b36BB6eaaed3223F50c7B6ac215673D27F6) will be returned to the treasury.\n- Withdraw and transfer JPGD from the migration contract representing a snapshot taken of the jpeg amount in the airdrop contract at 10/31/2024\n- Withdraw all JPEG remaining in the airdrop contract after the 10/31/2024",

This delegation of responsibility would eliminate the need for a cumbersome voting process, ensuring that our response to market fluctuations is both swift and informed.\n\nCompetitive Edge\n\nOur competitors are vigilant, and we must be no less. To remain competitive, I suggest that our rates be set within 5 percent of the prevailing market rates for NFT loans. This strategic flexibility will allow us to stay attractive to borrowers while safeguarding our interests.\n\nMaintaining Integrity and Accountability\n\nI understand the concern that may arise from such a delegation of power. Hence, I advocate for a transparent process where the team provides a monthly report on rate adjustments and the market conditions that influenced these decisions. This ensures accountability and keeps our community informed and engaged.",

      "title": "PIP-88 - Adapt lending interest rates to new market conditions",
      "content": "# Abstract\n\nThe market dynamics have changed and the DAO is currently lending way below market rate. This is impacting the DAO’s revenue and as a side effect impacting the demand on PUSd/pETH.\n\nThis proposal aims to raise the interest rates on the different JPEG’d vaults to bridge the gap with the current lending rates while remaining competitive and ensure fair revenue while also acknowledging our earliest users.\n\nIn a way to support future market conditions it also proposes to introduce a monthly rate change vote.\n\n# Background\n\nThe true market value for NFT lending is somewhere between 10-20% APR. JPEG'd is charging 2% APR for PUSd and 5% for pETH. Facing the current market conditions, the DAO is simply not getting enough of a fair share of market rate lending and the current rates are well below market. While attractive to new users, this is impacting the lending capacity as a side effect generating too much demand for cheap loans. Part of the duty of tokenholders, many of which are also users is to do what's best for the DAO as a whole. The DAO should be able to adapt lending rates according to the base lending rates. \n\nThis proposal suggests to adapt the current interest rates on all the JPEG’d vaults to make sure that most/all debt is paying a fair market rate while remaining competitive. Where needed and possible, a new C Vault would be opened.\n\nWhile the vaults are all akin to tranche tier structures and fixed rate for no expiration the intention was not to mean they are unchangeable but rather that they are not continuously fluctuating interest rates. The market for lending has simply changed in recent months and the vault rates should reflect this change.\n\nA market leader in the CDP lending space, Maker DAO, who also offers fixed rate lending recently raised their interest rate dramatically to reflect the changing market conditions.\n\nThe proposed rates below are still below market rates, making them still very attractive and make the yield opportunities on JPEG’d interesting for NFT holders. This will allow for all our earliest users to still benefit extremely low market rates. As a gesture of good faith, the Punks vault A, which holds our earliest user’s precious will get a first lower hike followed by incremental raises until reaching the same level as other vaults.\n\nMoreover in order to navigate an environment with changing rates, the DAO would introduce a monthly vote on the lending rates. We believe that adaptive fixed rates would be a happy medium between offering stable rates while allowing the DAO to reassess and communicate changes to borrowers on a routine basis. Rates changes would be voted by the DAO every 24th of the current month and be implemented on the 1st of the following month.\n\n# Specification\n\n- Update all the PUSd borrow rates for vault A to **10%**, for vault B to **13%**\n- Punk vault A will be undergoing incremental raise first to 7% then 1% every month until 10%\n- Introduce a monthly vote to determine the change in rates. Voting will go live every 24th of the current month and be implemented on the 1st of the following month.\n- In case of extreme situations, the team is allowed to make adjustments unilaterally",

However, Temple Dao, including individual members of the DAO, or actors loosely associated with Temple Dao have expressed large interest in JPEG'd DAO's treasury and financial strategies that benefit these actors at the expense of the DAO and it's mission.  \n\nThese members have NO interest in the mission or ethos of JPEG'd, which is NFT Finance and bridging the gap between DeFi and NFTs, and merely want to opportunistically plunder and loot the DAO.

This would cause JPEG'd to cease operations in order to appease the financial motives of a few opportunists.\n\n\nProposal\nAny proposals that involve the implementation of a buyback and burn (of JPGD tokens), distribution of Treasury assets, dissolution of Treasury, or use of any financial products created by Temple Dao or associated protocols will require necessary quorum to pass and a supermajority approval of JPGD voted in the proposal (67% in favor or greater). If neither quorum is hit or a supermajority approval is achieved the proposal is invalid.",

      "content": "Strategic Choices for Migration from JPEG to JPEGD\n\nBackground\nJPEG is currently more appealing to users, leading to its higher market performance compared to JPEGD. Additionally, the option to migrate to JPEGD at a fixed 1 to 1.44 ratio indefinitely has created a lack of urgency, resulting in delayed migration. This scenario hinders the ecosystem's transition to a more advanced and strategically aligned JPEGD token.\n\nChoice A: 5% Bonus for Migration within 25 Days\n\nDescription: Users who migrate to JPEGD within 25 days of this PIP passing are eligible for a 5% bonus in JPEGD tokens.\nCondition: To qualify for the bonus, users must not sell or transfer their JPEGD tokens during this 25-day period.\nExtended Reward: Early adopters who migrated to JPEGD before 2/16/2024 and have retained their tokens will receive a 5% bonus.\n\nChoice B: Introduce a definitive deadline for users to migrate from JPEG to JPEGD.\nDeadline: 60-day period post-PIP approval, with exceptions for customers with locked JPEGD tokens.\n\nChoice C: Continue with the current migration approach without changes.\n\nImplications: Potential ongoing slow migration, market confusion, and delayed adoption of JPEGD's new features.",

      "content": "### Abstract\n\nPrisma Finance is a new entrant in the Curve Wars of the liquid-staking derivate sector, offering high yield opportunities for ETH holders. JPEG’d DAO can benefit from this yielding opportunity by using some of its ETH to deposit on Prisma and farm in a nearly delta-neutral manner.\n\nJPEG’d could use some the ETH in treasury to farm on Prisma.\n\n### Background\n\nJPEG’d treasury is robust and partly sitting idle. Using Prisma finance would be a way to diversify the yield opportunities and increase the protocol’s revenues.\n\nPrisma Finance is similar to Liquity, offering a stablecoin: mkUSD against Liquid Staking ETH tokens. Like Liquity it offers a stability pool, whose role is to provide the necessary liquidity to cover the debt from liquidated vaults.\n\nUsing a portion of the DAO’s treasury, the following farming strategy is suggested:\n\n### Farming Mechanism\n\n1. Convert ETH to wstETH (wrapped staked ETH)\n2. Create Prisma Vault and deposit wstETH as collateral\n3. Use wstETH collateral to mint mkUSD\n4. Deposit mkUSD into Stability Pool\n\nThe MCR (minimum collateral ratio) would be kept at a maximum of 200% at all times, giving a 50% drop buffer against liquidations.\n\nDepending on market conditions it seems reasonable to believe this strategy will yield double digit APRs as seen below.\n\n| Prisma Strategy Yield Split | ETH Value | Yield | Weighed Yields |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| stETH Collateral | 1 | 3.50% | 3.50% |\n| mkUSD Value Borrowed in ETH | 0.25 | -4.00% | -1.00% |\n| Yield on Active Debt Position | 0.25 | 7.83% | 1.96% |\n| 0.5% mkUSD Mint Fees | 0.00125 | 0.00% | 0.00% |\n| Value as ETH in mkUSD Stability Pool | 0.24875 | 25.13% | 6.25% |\n| Total Yields Relative to stETH Deposit |  |  | 10.71% |\n\n**More Details about Prisma Finance:**\nApp: https://app.prismafinance.com/vaults\nDocumentation: https://docs.prismafinance.com/\n\n### Specification\n\nAllow the team to use up to 2k ETH to farm on Prisma Finance to generate yield for JPEG’d DAO using the strategy described above.",

We recognize that not everyone has the same taste (evident from our recent escapades), so the choices are as follows:\n\nA mid-tier adult beverage, for those who wish to toast to the chaos and our eventual triumph.\n\nA sarsaparilla, for those who prefer an old-fashioned touch to their celebrations.\n\nA bottle of water, served in a classy glass bottle, of course, for those who believe in staying hydrated amidst the fires of adversity.\n\nA low grade bottle of Vodka for aquatic mamels to butt-chug\n\nRationale:\n\nIt’s evident that our teamn showcased a peculiar blend of talents during the CRV hack incident. While this proposal may seem frivolous at a glance, it's an opportunity to:\n\nFoster goodwill and camaraderie amidst our members, even if it’s expressed through snark and sarcasm.\nRemind ourselves to find humor and unity even in times of chaos and uncertainty.\nAct as a tangible thank-you gesture for the sleepless nights, baffling suggestions, and, let’s be honest, endless entertainment provided by the jpeg’d team.\n\nExecution:\n\nEach member will be given the option to choose their preferred drink, because after all, we're nothing if not inclusive. And in the spirit of sustainability, the water will be served in glass bottles only – we do have some standards.\n\nConclusion:\n\nIn this rollercoaster of digital dilemmas, amidst the bits and bytes, let’s not forget the human touch. Let’s raise a glass (be it filled with wine, sarsaparilla, or water) to the chaos, the madness, and the unexpected moments that keep us united.\nMay our future endeavors be slightly less chaotic, but always memorable.\n\nCheers!",

      "title": "Proposal: Empower Our Team with the Option to Acquire up to 861,043,575 JPEGd tokens",
      "content": "Overview:\nIn an evolving market, strategic flexibility is paramount. We believe our team should be granted the discretion to purchase up to 861,043,575 JPEGd tokens. The timing and decision to do so should be at the team's discretion, bearing in mind the broader market dynamics and the best interests of all stakeholders.\n\nAdvantages:\n\nBoosted Morale among Holders: Providing our team with the option to make this acquisition would not only strengthen the trust of current holders but would also demonstrate our proactive stance in navigating market opportunities.\n\nEncouraging Additional Investments: An uptick in confidence among JPEGd holders, resulting from this move, would likely encourage them to increase their token holdings. When existing holders augment their stakes, it sends a potent signal to potential new investors about the strength and potential of our ecosystem.\n\nPotential for Long-term Price Stability: The proposed purchase can help steady the market, potentially reducing price volatility and instilling a greater sense of stability among investors.\n\nTangible Returns for the Treasury: As market conditions ameliorate, this strategic acquisition could yield significant returns for our treasury, enhancing the financial fortitude of our entire community.\n\nBenefits to the DAO: With the DAO holding a substantial number of JPEGd tokens, increased confidence and subsequent investments from JPEGd holders would inflate the value of the DAO’s assets. This would reinforces the DAO's strength.\n\nConsiderations:\n\nMinimal Risk: While any investment comes with inherent risks, our team's deep market knowledge and the potential long-term advantages make the risks linked with this move quite diminutive.",

      "title": "PIP-74 Choose disbursement of the addresses impacted by the Curve hack",
      "content": "# Abstract\n\nThere was an exploit of the Curve Finance pETH/ETH pool related to a bug in the Vyper Compiler. This resulted in a loss of 6,106 WETH to liquidity providers of this pool. After the pool was drained a material amount of trading activity was made on the pool buying discounted pETH with ETH. This activity contributed to losses to liquidity providers.\n\nJPEG'd DAO recovered **5,495.4 WETH** related to the exploit. This post proposes a range of options for the disbursement of the recovered WETH **to all addresses that incurred losses due to the Curve exploit**.\n\nThe resolution of this situation requires issuing a new pETH token, which will be airdropped to wallets holding pETH before the exploit at 1 pETH : 1 ETH.\n\nThe vote is to choose one of the reimbursement distribution options below.\n\n# Background\n\nThe Curve exploit impacted the pETH-ETH pool by minting too many pETH-ETH LP tokens, effectively corrupting the pool and rendering the LP tokens and pETH valueless. Shortly thereafter, several users withdrew underlying tokens, often drastically more pETH than they deposited, repaid loans cheaply, or acquired heavily discounted pETH. Both actions contributed to damages to liquidity providers and the DAO from the exploit. \n\nA snapshot was taken of the state of pETH and pETH LPs before the exploit to quantify exposure per address. A new version of pETH will be created and airdropped to affected addresses in accordance with the option below approved. NFT vaults will be updated to work with the new pETH token. Addresses that profited from the exploit, and thus did not suffer damages are excluded from the options. \n\nThe options range from making every impacted address whole (option A), to sharing the costs across all the impacted users at a loss of the Curve exploit (option F).\n\nAffected addresses will receive pETH, pETH/WETH liquidity pool tokens, JPEG/pETH LP tokens, ETH, and/or JPEG tokens.\n\n# Specifications\n\nThe DAO will vote on one of the 6 disbursement options. Costs to the JPEG’d DAO are presented at the bottom of each option. Sub-item costs are also listed. There are global costs that need to be accounted for in all options in order to arrive at the final cost figures for the JPEG’d DAO in each option. The pETH-JPEG LP reimbursement is dependent on the price of JPEG at the time of the airdrop and is estimated.\n\nThere will be 800 pETH added to the new JPEG/pETH liquidity pool at the time the new pool is deployed, less 3,948 pETH minted from NFTs in vaults, less 2,001.89 pETH minted from the DAO and auto-compounder vault, 465 pETH minted by the JPEG’d DAO liquidator. Please note the pETH cost related to redeploying the JPEG/pETH can fluctuate and will depend on the market price of JPEG at the time the pool is deployed. It may cost the DAO more JPEG and less pETH, or vice versa.\n\nFor example in option A: \n\n+7,100.93 ETH (pETH/WETH lp tokens for Citadel users)\n+734.16 ETH, 215.6m (pETH speculators cost)\n\n+84.81 pETH (pETH Holders)\n\n+3,218.3 ETH (pETH/ETH lp tokens for non-Citadel users)\n\n+137.77 pETH, 228.3m (realized losses to JPEG/pETH liquidity providers)\n\n**= 11,191.16 gross ETH exposure**\n\n-3,948 (pETH minted by NFT vaults)\n-5,495.40 (ETH recovered)\n\n-2,001.89 (pETH minted by auto-compounder and DAO)\n+465 (pETH minted by JPEG’d liquidator)\n+800 pETH and 450m JPEG (added to new JPEG/pETH pool)\n\n**= 1095.68 ETH and 893,9m JPEG**\n\n## Options\n\n### Option A:\n\n1.

This high LTV allocation heavily favored cigs and left little room for token appreciation, as it increased the risk tolerance exclusively for cigs. Additionally, cigs received free tokens and were included in the WW whitelist. Furthermore, after minting, cigs LTV was increased from 7 to 10, representing a 42% boost.\n\nIn contrast, tokens received minimal benefits. They were eventually granted a trait buff, but it is now being revoked due to pressure from Makesy, who threatened to leave the platform if the risk associated with cigs was reduced even slightly. Consequently, the team is compelled to nerf an already devalued asset by appeasing a single individual.\n\nNot only is this unfair, but it also lacks logical reasoning.

The different traits multipliers would be re-evaluated bi-weekly, changes would be announced on Friday and executed the following Monday. \n\n### Background\n\nExtreme market conditions are impacting collections floors but also the value of rarer items in the collections. Until now, the traits multipliers have been fixed. Even though they were evaluated conservatively, a rare trait might be sold below its historical floor. If there’s a sudden change, it might become possible for ill-intentioned users to abuse the multiplier system.\n\nOne of the mechanisms currently in place allows the team to lower the debt ceiling, effectively preventing any borrowing until the situation is resolved. However, Multipliers can only be updated via PIPs, which might be too slow to address extreme conditions. To minimize the risk on the DAO, it would be best to allow the team to monitor traits multiplier and adjust them accordingly on a per-collection basis.\n\nThe traits benefiting from multipliers would be monitored closely and evaluated bi-weekly, after which an update might be pushed to the traits, always with the proper announcements via the DAO’s communication channels.\n\nTarget multipliers would be announced on Friday and executed the following Monday. \n\n### Specification\n\n- Re-evaluate the different traits multiplier across all collections bi-weekly.\n- If necessary, update the multiplier values.\n- If changes are needed, they will be announced on Fridays and executed on Mondays",

Many if not all of the traits live on JPEG'd are higher than recent market data. \nBased on updated market analysis, we are proposing new trait multipliers for BAYC that represent the current market data adjusted with for the levels of risk the JPEG'd DAO is willing to underwrite.

      "title": "PIP-64 Update LTV an boost parameters",
      "content": "# Abstract\n\nThe application of PIP-58 has introduced unforeseen risks to the DAO, stemming from the combination of outdated multipliers and higher LTVs. This proposal aims to address them by:\n\n- Reducing the maximum boosted LTV from +20% to **+10%**\n- Reduce Liquidation Threshold across all collections by **1%**\n- Limit combined LTV Boost and Cig Boost to **+10%**\n- Burning the locked JPEG of a boosted position in case of liquidation\n- Keeping the Base LTV introduced by PIP-58\n- Keeping the BAYC and Azuki vaults closed until the trait multipliers for those collections can be revised and eventually updated with a subsequent PIP\n\n# Background\n\nAfter implementing the changes from PIP-58, some users have found ways to arbitrage assets with overvalued multipliers. As a security measure, the team has closed the Azuki and BAYC vaults.\n\nPIP-58 aimed to make JPEG’d more competitive, but the chosen parameters were too aggressive. The LTV updates have been applied with multipliers that are out of date with the current market state. Traits Multipliers, an innovation in this space, need to be fine-tuned to be more efficient. Like the floor, the premium associated with traits is moving and more so for newer collections, so a better method for addressing them needs to be put in place.\n\nTo reduce risk on the DAO and to remove the ability for a user to borrow too close to liquidation, this proposal suggests to: \n\n- Reduce the max  LTV boosts from 20% to **+10%**, for example allowing for a max borrow of **70%** LTV for Cryptopunks and BAYCs (see table below for full details). The Max Liquidation Threshold will remain the same, and existing positions boosted beyond **10%** will not be at risk of liquidation.\n- Reduce Liquidation Threshold and Liquidation Buffer values across all collections by **1%**\n- Implement a burn mechanism of the locked JPEG in case of liquidation. The burn would be instant for the uninsured position, while for the insured position, the JPEG would be burned only if the position is not repaid within the grace period.\n\nTo accompany this measure, a longer-term plan is being undertaken to revise the traits multipliers, their current relevancy in the current market, and possibly automate their value to track the market. Until this is enabled, the BAYC and Azuki vaults will remain closed. This will be the object of a follow-up PIP.\n\n| Collection Name | Base LTV | Base Liquidation Threshold | Cig Boost | Max LTV Boost | Max Boosted LTV | Max Boosted Liquidation Threshold |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Cryptopunks | 60 | 70 | 10 | 10 | 70 | 80 |\n| BAYC | 60 | 70 | 10 | 10 | 70 | 80 |\n| MAYC | 50 | 60 | 10 | 10 | 60 | 70 |\n| BAKC | 40 | 50 | 10 | 10 | 50 | 60 |\n| Azuki | 50 | 60 | 10 | 10 | 60 | 70 |\n| CloneX | 40 | 50 | 10 | 10 | 50 | 60 |\n| Doodles | 40 | 50 | 10 | 10 | 50 | 60 |\n| Meebits | 40 | 50 | 10 | 10 | 50 | 60 |\n| Pudgy Penguins | 50 | 60 | 10 | 10 | 60 | 70 |\n| Otherdeeds | 40 | 50 | 10 | 10 | 50 | 60 |\n| Milady | 50 | 60 | 10 | 10 | 60 | 70 |\n| Autoglyphs | 40 | 50 | 10 | 10 | 50 | 60 |\n| Fidenza | 40 | 50 | 10 | 10 | 50 | 60 |\n\n# Specifications\n\n- Keep the updated base LTVs values as per PIP-58\n- Reduce the max LTV Boost value from +20% → **+10%**\n- Limit combined LTV Boost and Cig Boost to **+10%** LTV increase\n- Reduce Liquidation Threshold and Liquidation buffer across all collections by **1%**\n- When an uninsured position is liquidated, the locked JPEG would be burned.

It could be made even better. \nThe proposed updates include:\n- modifying the lock expiration mechanism;\n- defining a Max Boosted LTV per collection;\n- increasing the liquidation buffer from 1% above the Base LTV to 11% above the Base LTV (up until the Max Boosted LTV).\n\nThe current base LTV on JPEG’d is lower than the competition and would be raised to match the rest of the market (ie 35% to 60% for Cryptopunks).\n\nThe proposal aims to have the following impact:\n- Make JPEG’d more attractive for borrowing by aligning the base LTV\n- Reduce user friction when creating boosts all while maintaining the JPEG boost as a supply sink\n\n# **Background**\n\n## **Base LTV**\n\nJPEG’d current base LTV is lower than the competition. To make JPEG’d more attractive to borrow the base LTV of selected collections should be raised,\n\n## **JPEG Boosts**\n\nThe introduction of JPEG boosts has been a success, with around 1.5B tokens currently locked on JPEG’d and boosting positions. Traits boosts have also been borrowed by other platforms. The current design has friction and adds complexity to the user’s decisions when borrowing and boosting.\n\n- They have to take on the JPEG price movements into account for the time of the lock, which creates unknown costs\n- The moment the locks disable can lead to instant liquidations (although the introduction of the JPEG alert mitigates this now)\n\nThis is not yet an ideal UX and would be greatly improved if the below changes are implemented.\n\n# **Specifications**\n\nThe following changes would be introduced to the LTV boost mechanics:\n\n- increasing the base LTV of select collections to match the competition as per the table below.\n- allow JPEG LTV boost to reach max LTV **without** the cig boost\n- introduce a Max Liquidation Threshold to cap LTV when the cig boost and the LTV boost are combined\n- add a buffer for liquidation of 11% beyond the Base LTV up to the Max Liquidation Threshold rather than 1% like currently\n- replace the time-lock on the boost to make it perpetual and add a processing delay of 7 days for withdrawals (i.e., the user would place a request for withdrawal which would disable the boost in 7 days and unlock the JPEG tokens)\n- Allow canceling a withdrawal request\n- Existing JPEG Boosts will be marked as having a withdrawal requested and their unlock time will be the current unlock time set when the boost was created. Users can cancel the withdrawal request anytime and transform the boost in a perpetual boost.\n\nTo complete this update this proposal suggests increasing the base LTV of the selected collections to make them in line with the competition. This would make JPEG boosts more competitive as they would unlock more capital than what’s available elsewhere.\n\nThe other parameters for enabling boosts would remain the same:\n\n- The amount of JPEG to lock is calculated the same as before, keeping the value in ETH of $JPEG to lock consistent, independent of the USD price of $JPEG.\n- Each collection has an independent max LTV boost and base LTV\n- Cig Boost and LTV Boost can still be combined up to the Max LTV and Max Liquidation Threshold\n\nTo ensure smooth operations, enable the team to update base LTV and max boost of the different collections.\n\n| Collection | Current Base LTV | Future Base LTV | Max LTV Boost | Cig Boost | Base Liquidation Threshold | Max Boosted LTV | Max Liquidation Threshold |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Cryptopunks | 35% | 60% | 20% | 10% | 71% | 80% | 81% |\n| BAYC | 35% | 60% | 20% | 10% | 71% | 80% | 81% |\n| MAYC | 35% | 50% | 20% | 10% | 61% | 70% | 71% |\n| BAKC | 35% | 40% | 20% | 10% | 51% | 60% | 61% |\n| Meebits | 35% | 40% | 20% | 10% | 51% | 60% | 61% |\n| Pudgy Penguins | 35% | 50% | 20% | 10% | 61% | 70% | 71% |\n| Milady | 35% | 50% | 20% | 10% | 61% | 70% | 71% |\n| Doodles | 35% | 40% | 20% | 10% | 51% | 60% | 61% |\n| Azuki | 35% | 50% | 20% | 10% | 61% | 70% | 71% |\n| Clonex | 35% | 40% | 20% | 10% | 51% | 60% | 61% |\n| Autogylphs | 35% | 40% | 20% | 10% | 51% | 60% | 61% |\n| Fidenza | 35% | 40% | 20% | 10% | 51% | 60% | 61% |\n| Ringers | 35% | 40% | 20% | 10% | 51% | 60% | 61% |\n| Chromie Squiggles | 35% | 40% | 20% | 10% | 51% | 60% | 61% |\n| Otherdeeds | 35% | 40% | 20% | 10% | 51% | 60% | 61% |\n| Etherocks | 35% | 40% | 20% | 10% | 51% | 60% | 61% |",

      "content": "Abstract:\n\nImplement a p2p APE staking market to allow BAYC/MAYC/BAKC holders to find peer APECoin providers and co-stake in the APE staking pools.\n\nBackground:\n\nAPE staking is essential in attracting BAYC/MAYC/BAKC holders on JPEG’d. Most holders do not have enough APE to profit from the Yuga APECoin Staking program. As such they need to either borrow or use services to find peers to stake APE with them in the respective pools.\nJPEG’d currently offers the ability to stake APE solo, meaning the NFT holder is also the APE provider \n\nThis proposal aims to add a P2P APE staking market for BAYC/MAYC/BAKC/APE holders on JPEG’d. This will allow Yuga NFT holders with no APE to profit from both the Citadel yield AND the APE staking program, giving them the highest possible yield they could get at the lowest rates. This would make JPEG’d a very competitive platform for BAYC/MAYC users to take part in the program. Only NFTs deposited in JPEG’d vaults would be eligible for the market, but any APE provider could use the market to peer-stake any amount of APE.\n\nSpecifications:\n\nCreate a marketplace where:\n\n- BAYC/MAYC users can list assets in JPEG’d vaults to find co-stakers, with the ability to define the reward share per provider per pool (BAYC/MAYC pool and BAKC pool)\n- Allow the pairing to be partial, ie any user could co-stake in a listed peer pool as long as the cap is not met.\n- Rewards are claimable at all times respectively of the % of the pool held\n- APE providers should be able to withdraw their assets at all time\n- If a BAYC/MAYC is withdrawn from the Ape Pairing (by unstaking, closing the position, or a liquidation), the APE paired in the BAYC/MAYC pools should be sent to the Single Staking pool while awaiting to be unstaked by the user (this ensures that APE providers will ALWAYS be earning yield). In the case of APE in the BAKC pool, the assets would be idle, until the APECoin owner will pair them into another pool.",

We require evidence that it was selected randomly, as well as an assessment of the implications of limited cigs and a 10 LTV being offered to whitelisted investors.\n\nThe second area of investigation is the Rock vault. We need to understand why the vault was closed at such a high floor and who was locked in.\n\nFinally, we need to investigate the IJPEG. We need to understand why it was created, how much money the team invested, and whether the team purposely recruited other JPEG whales to control the votes of the JPEGD Dao. \n\nAdditionally, we must investigate if the team and whales they recruited will use their votes in JPEGD Dao to give themselves unreasonable benefits in IJPEGD that hurts the JPEGD Dao.\n\nWe appreciate your consideration of this request.",

This PIP would airdrop iJPEG index tokens to the donators who govern, oversee, and administer the NFTs. The JPEG’d DAO would donate back these assets to iJPEG holders, while the assets remain custodied in the JPEG’d DAO multisig. \n\n### Specifications\n\nDonators of the JPEG Index would receive an airdrop of iJPEG for each ETH they donated, i.e., 20 ETH donated would receive 20 iJPEG tokens back. The NFTs are no longer owned by the JPEG’d DAO and are instead owned by iJPEG holders with custody by the JPEG’d DAO. Changes to the index, which may include composition of assets or what the assets do would be now governed by iJPEG holders. 10% quorum and simple majority is required for valid governance proposals regarding the JPEG Index via iJPEG holders.",

This proposal would create the JPEG Index that would own such a basket. The index would buy 1 CryptoPunk, 1 BAYC, 1 MAYC, 2 Pudgy Penguins, 1 Doodle, and 5 Kanpai Pandas. The assets would be custodied in the JPEG'd DAO (a decentralized entity). There is no expectation of profits, and launching the JPEG Index does not constitute a sale, or investment contract.\n\nSpecifications\nUsers would donate 350 ETH to the JPEG'd DAO and will use the proceeds to purchase the above NFTs. Any excess ETH after purchasing these NFTs would remain as extra ETH in the index to potentially purchase additional NFTs at a later date. The max donation per wallet is 30 ETH. There is no token associated with this donation, and it is a voluntary donation with no expectation of profits. ",

      "content": "ABSTRACT\nSeveral punks are valued higher than floor, while currently JPEG’d values all punks at floor using an oracle from Chainlink. This proposal would introduce multipliers for certain punk traits to be valued higher than floor.\n\nBACKGROUND\nPunks such as Apes and Aliens are valued by the market to be much, much higher than floor. This proposal would apply multipliers to selected punk attributes giving them a higher credit limit on the JPEG’d protocol. For example, if the punk floor oracle is 100 ETH and a 30x multiplier is given to Ape punks a user would be eligible to increase his credit limit to 3,000 ETH.\n\nIn order to do so he or she would need to lock 10% of the increased credit limit in the form of JPEG. The lock can be selected by the user to any time period (1 day, 5 months, 2 years, etc.). If the user does not relock JPEG when the lock expires the punk value would return to floor.\n\nAssuming ETH is $1,000… 3,000 ETH x 45% (max LTV) = 1,350 ETH x 10% (lock requirement = 135 ETH x $1,000 = $135,000 worth of JPEG.\n\nHere are the proposed multiplier values:\nAlien = 60x floor\nApe = 30x floor\n\nThese values would take the punk floor oracle from Chainlink and apply the above multipliers. As such, their valuations fluctuate with movements of the punk floor oracle. Changes to these multipliers or additional traits can be added with a valid PIP.\n\nProposal\nImplement punk trait multipliers with the above values and specifications.",

      "content": "Abstract\nSeveral punks are valued higher than floor, while currently JPEG'd values all punks at floor using an oracle from Chainlink. This proposal would introduce multipliers for certain punk traits to be valued higher than floor.\n\nBackground\nPunks such as hoodies are valued by the market to be higher than floor. This proposal would apply multipliers to selected punk attributes giving them a higher credit limit on the JPEG'd protocol. For example, if the punk floor oracle is 100 ETH and a 3x multiplier is given to hoodie punks a user would be eligible to increase his credit limit to 300 ETH. In order to do so he or she would need to lock 10% of the increased credit limit in the form of JPEG. The lock can be selected by the user to any time period (1 day, 5 months, 2 years, etc.). If the user does not relock JPEG when the lock expires the punk value would return to floor. \n\nAssuming ETH is $1,000. 300 ETH x 32% (max LTV) = 96 ETH x 10% (lock requirement = 9.6 ETH x $1,000 = $9,600 worth of JPEG. \n\nHere are the proposed multiplier values:\nZombie = 10x floor\nBeanie = 4x floor\nHoodie = 3x floor\nPilot Helmet = 2x floor\nTiara = 2x floor\n3D Glasses = 1.75x floor\nTop Hat = 1.75x floor\nCowboy Hat = 1.5x floor\nOrange Side = 1.4x floor\nBuck Teeth = 1.2x floor\nWelding Glasses = 1.2x floor\nPink With Hat = 1.2x floor\nWild White Hair = 1.2x floor\nBig Beard = 1.2x floor\nVampire Hair = 1.2x floor\nGold Chain = 1.2x floor\nVR = 1.2x floor\nClown Hair Green = 1.1x floor\nPurple Hair = 1.1x floor\nPolice Cap = 1.1x floor\n\nThese values would take the punk floor oracle from Chainlink and apply the above multipliers. As such, their valuations fluctuate with movements of the punk floor oracle. Changes to these multipliers or additional traits can be added with a valid PIP. \n\nProposal\nImplement punk trait multipliers with the above values and specifications. \n\n",

      "content": "Add a vault for the CryptoPunks V1.  The vault can be identical to the current CryptoPunks vault as the collections are identical. \n\nUpon addition of the vault we have at least 30  CryptoPunks V1 committed to deposit at launch.  \n\nOpenSea collection link: https://opensea.io/collection/official-v1-punks\n\nAbout CryptoPunks V1: \nLaunched in June 2017 by Larva Labs, Cryptopunks were originally free for anyone with an Ethereum wallet to claim (+ gas).  The Punks were a huge hit at launch and all of them were claimed incredibly fast.  In the original Cryptopunks smart contract, there was a code error that caused Ethereum to be allocated to the buyer instead of the seller when a purchase was made. In other words, a buyer was immediately refunded for their purchase and was able to keep the Punk.\n \nNot long after the bug was found a newer version of the Punks contract (Version 2, V2) was released and Punks were airdropped to this new contract.  V1 Punk owners are now able to wrap their Punks into an ERC-721 contract (another kind of standardized smart contract) and patch over the bug.   This recovery of the original Punks smart contract is a community led and rapidly growing phenomenon consisting of original Punk claimant’s, NFT historians, digital archeologists and extremely talented developers.  There is no clear leader and all important decisions are voted on by community members.\n \nV1 Punks exist just as V2s do. This cannot be changed or undone since the V1 Punks are a permanent part of the blockchain.  The new wrappers impart a slight change to the image in the form of a new background While this is a very modest change in the image, the core Punk remains the same. \n \nWhile the V1 Punks still exist in their original form, so does the existing bug in the V1 contract so NEVER put an unwrapped V1 on sale as you will most likely loose it.  V1 Punks are not a derivative but are in fact the \"original/classic\" Cryptopunks. This is verified on the Ethereum blockchain and is immutable.",

This would attract more liquidity to this pool and benefit the JPEG'd DAO and borrowers of the protocol. \n\nProposal\nAuthorize the JPEG'd DAO to purchase up to $15m worth of CVX over to be used to vote for the upcoming pUSD/3CRV pool. CVX would be sourced either through the open market or OTC. This authorization would be valid for up to 6 months. ",
