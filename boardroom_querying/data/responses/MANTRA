      "title": "Update around OM Tokenomics moving into MANTRA Chain Mainnet",
      "content": "Dear Sherpa community,\n\nIn recent months, there has been a notable shift in market sentiment surrounding projects that have permitted early token unlocks to venture capital investors, raising concerns about their potential risks. This trend can lead to unhealthy volatility and unsustainable growth, which ultimately jeopardizes the long-term stability of projects and their communities. Recognizing these challenges, the MANTRA team has been diligently engaging with our community to explore a more robust and thoughtful approach to our governance and tokenomics.\n\n### Reasons for Proposal:\n\nOur primary goal is to create lasting value for the future, focusing on sustainable growth rather than short-term spikes. This commitment reflects our long-term vision for MANTRA and the OM token, aiming to position us as the key player in the realms of Real World Assets (RWA) and the global crypto market. Together, we can build a foundation that not only withstands the test of time but also paves the way for meaningful advancements in the industry.\n\nIn response to these developments, this proposal will present detailed insights into our new tokenomics, inviting the Sherpa community to participate in a vote. We believe that fostering broad acceptance before the launch of the MANTRA Chain mainnet is essential to our collective success.\n\nThis proposal will cover the following key areas:\n\n- Token Allocations, Vesting and Cliff Structures\n- Simplifications in the Inflation Rate\n- Emission Schedule\n\nAdditionally, we have a special surprise for all our supporters regarding the OM Upgrade Rewards, so we encourage you to read through to the end. This will ensure you are well-informed before casting your vote.\n\n### Proposal Summary:\n\n#### Token Allocations, Vesting and Cliff Structures\n\nIn the original Tokenomics Update proposal (https://snapshot.org/#/mantra-dao.eth/proposal/0x46c0b602c7ca8e3d06f07fa70e54ab8bc6a9de0611568c1a5dbb4a8c8ef30626) we shared basic information around the Genesis token allocation of each category. Within this proposal, we are now revealing further details.\n\n![Allocation_Proposal.png](ipfs://bafkreid257d65q57hml7lsakfn7yxn4tjdei5asflgpqeijfvdo4xu7r7a)\n\nAs you can see, it is crucial for us to strike the right balance between aligning long-term investors with MANTRA and rewarding our early community supporters for their trust and commitment.\n\nThe longest cliff and vesting schedule is dedicated to the Team and Core Contributors, signaling our commitment to long-term thinking and building. We firmly believe in the immense value and growth potential that MANTRA's RWA-focused blockchain will bring to the crypto industry. \n\nTo establish robust network security from the outset, these tokens will be staked. However, the rewards generated from staking will not be distributed to the team or its contributors; instead, they will be either burned or distributed to the community through a future governance vote. As the network achieves organic network security growth, the amount of staked tokens will be gradually reduced and ultimately phased out, with the community playing a crucial role in determining the methodology.\n\nThe second longest vesting period is reserved for our early investors who participated in the Pre-Seed and Seed Rounds. Our focus is not on achieving quick wins for venture capitalists; rather, we seek strategic partners eager to revolutionize Real World Asset tokenization alongside us for the long haul. At genesis, the investors' tokens will be staked, with all accrued rewards subject to the same vesting schedule as their principal investments.\n\nAdditionally, the unvested portion of the MANTRA Chain Association Ecosystem (37.7 million OM) is intentionally kept small at TGE, designed to support future OM liquidity provision, builder incentives, and community initiatives from Day 1. A prime example is the recent launch of the Chakra Pool, which has seeded initial liquidity for the MANTRA Chain mainnet, incentivized through OM. As the ecosystem matures, more tokens will become available through inflation.\n\nThe MANTRA Mainnet Airdrop, known as the “GenDrop,” will distribute 50 million OM tokens to those who have engaged with us. For further details about the GenDrop, please refer to our Medium article (https://mantrachain.medium.com/mantra-50m-om-gendrop-explained-e6109f73ad2f).\n\nAs noted, we propose that the airdrop allocation will begin vesting three months after the Mainnet launch. To provide immediate benefits to participants, 20% of the allocation will be liquid as soon as the cliff period ends. This is to boost our community and to give tangible benefits to our supporters. The three-month cliff is designed to encourage users and newcomers to engage with the MANTRA Chain mainnet while also allowing them to earn or increase their GenDrop allocation, for example by earning KARMA through onchain quests during that period.\n\n#### Simplifications in the Inflation Rate\n\nAfter extensive discussions with community members and experts regarding our proposed inflation model, we are today proposing a modification to our initial plan. Instead of implementing a variable inflation rate, we propose a fixed inflation rate of 8% during the first year. Out of this, 60% (or 4.8%) will be allocated as staking rewards to help secure the network, while the remaining 40% (or 3.2%) will be directed to the MANTRA Chain Association to support future initiatives. These initiatives will contribute towards liquidity incentives to boost TVL, ensure development of public goods for the chain as well as support RWA dApps. \n\n![inflation_proposal.png](ipfs://bafkreiepiny77sbi7ee6vqjkwv2dtz5jppuf36frbuwpc34hihrrdpodfq)\n\nAdditionally, it's important to note that the inflation rate may be amended through regular review no less than once per year while ensuring users are informed of the process.\n\n#### The “Special Surprise”\n\nAfter careful consideration and in alignment with our long-term vision, we are excited to reward our OM stakers who have dedicated their OM tokens to our staking product over the past months. Despite not distributing any auto-accumulated OM rewards, our stakers remained steadfast, leading to a remarkable increase in staked OM, recently surpassing the 250 million staked OM milestone—a significant achievement for our company.\n\nTo celebrate this milestone, we are going to increase the maximum tokens that stakers will receive as rewards. The maximum allocation will move from 35% to 130% and your allocations will be adjusted accordingly once we distribute the rewards. The final allocation will still follow our system of regular snapshots that we recorded during this initiative, as mentioned in the original proposal.\n\nFor Sherpas who staked less than 100,000 OM in total, rewards will vest over 18 months, while those with more than 100,000 OM will see their rewards vest over 36 months. This approach not only allows everyone to benefit from the increased allocation but also helps mitigate sell pressure over a timeframe that we believe is fair, especially in light of community feedback, while ensuring that smaller OM holders are not adversely affected by the activity of larger OM holders in this incentive model.\n\nAny unallocated portion of the OM Upgrade bucket will subsequently vest into the MANTRA Chain Association following the same 36 months vesting schedule, to provide ongoing support for ecosystem development and future initiatives.\n\nPlease note that with this proposal being published, the snapshots for OM Staking have ended. There will be further announcements on the continuation of OM staking on EVM soon - please check our channels.\n\n#### Emission Schedule\n\nFollowing all considerations mentioned above, we would like to show and add the Emission Schedule within this proposal that will reflect the future emissions of OM. \n\n![emissions schedule proposal.png](ipfs://bafkreifsdtfcmzlkmbtv5klf2mxdcw3ub4nnpzavs24nlf6vvc4urw3pey)\n\nIt is important to highlight that, at the time of the Mainnet launch, over 90% of the legacy OM will already be in circulation. When we add the liquid 37.7 million OM from the MANTRA Chain Association, we will start with a circulating supply of approximately 880 million OM, representing about 49.5% of the new total supply at TGE. This demonstrates that, despite the new tokenomics, OM maintains a substantial float and is not merely focused on achieving a high fully diluted valuation (FDV).\n\n#### Conclusion\n\nAs we move towards the launch of the MANTRA Chain mainnet, we stand at a pivotal moment in our journey. This proposal reflects our commitment to creating a sustainable and thriving ecosystem that benefits all stakeholders. Your participation is crucial in shaping the future of MANTRA and ensuring that our vision for long-term growth becomes a reality.\n\nBy voting in favor of these new tokenomics, you help us lay a strong foundation for MANTRA Chain, fostering stability, engagement, and innovation. Together, we can build a platform that not only withstands the test of time but also revolutionizes the way we engage with Real World Assets in the crypto space.\n\nWe invite each of you to review the details, consider the benefits for our community, and cast your vote. Your voice matters, and together, we can drive MANTRA towards a prosperous future. Thank you for being an essential part of our journey!\n\n----\n\nWe will run this proposal for 7 days (168 hours) commencing at 3 PM UTC on Thursday October 3rd 2024 and ending at 3 PM UTC on Thursday October 10th 2024.",

      "title": "MANTRA DAO Core Proposal: Create $OM Liquidity Pool on Base Chain",
      "content": "Dear Sherpas,\n\nWe are thrilled to share the incredible success stories and remarkable growth of our community over the past few weeks. The Hongbai Testnet and the MANTRA Atom Validator have experienced a surge in usage and popularity, contributing to MANTRA’s strong foundation.\n\nOne key factor behind this growth is our steadfast commitment to a multi-chain approach. This approach has enabled us to expand OM’s availability and attract new use cases, while continuously nurturing our Sherpa community.\n\nIn line with our strategy to broaden OM’s adoption and visibility, we are excited to propose the establishment of the first OM liquidity pool on Base Chain. As one of the top five EVM-compatible chains with significant momentum, Base Chain presents a compelling opportunity for us to reach a wider audience and further enhance OM’s utility.\n\n### Reason for Proposal:\n\nBase has gained significant traction and adoption within the blockchain community. Its growing ecosystem and active user base present a valuable opportunity for our project to reach a wider audience and foster greater user engagement. By expanding to Base, we can leverage this thriving community and establish meaningful partnerships that enhance the overall value proposition of our project.\n\nFurther, with over US$2.6 billion of native USDC onchain and growing fast, we believe that Base is becoming a hub for stablecoin liquidity. As such, we hope to establish meaningful liquidity for the OM token on Base as a prelude to launching other products within the ecosystem.\n\n### Proposal Summary:\n\nWe propose to take a portion of the protocol owned liquidity from the OM/ETH Pool on UniswapV2 and to bootstrap a new OM/ETH liquidity pool on Uniswap V2 on Base Chain.\n\n### Details:\n\nThe OM/ETH Liquidity Pool on UniswapV2 currently has more than US$4M in liquidity, which allows for sizable onchain swaps with minimal slippage. Around US$3M of this liquidity is owned by MANTRA. We would take 25% of the Uniswap liquidity pool on Ethereum and use it to bootstrap the Base liquidity pool. This will create a deep liquidity pool allowing for effective swaps on Base involving OM. \n\nMoving the OM token to Base requires the following simple process as provided by Coinbase.\n\nThere are three steps to get an existing L1 token on Base: https://docs.base.org/docs/tokens/list\n\nAnd one step to get it trading in the Coinbase wallet: https://docs.base.org/docs/tokens/wallet\n\nUpon approval of this proposal, we will start the work on all of the above.\n\n### Councils Comments:\n\nEmbracing a multi-chain strategy has been a fundamental principle for MANTRA since its inception. This strategic approach has played a pivotal role in driving exponential growth within our Sherpa community. Now, as we chart our course forward, we firmly believe that expanding to Base represents the logical and progressive next step for our project. Base’s significant traction, growing ecosystem, and active user base provide an opportunity to reach a wider audience and foster greater user engagement. Additionally, embracing Base enhances our liquidity profile, which will be a key feature to support mainnet OM. With pools on Ethereum, Base, BNB Chain and Polygon, we hope to provide users with more options and flexibility to enjoy OM as we move towards our mainnet.\n\nThank you for coming along on this journey with us!\n\nSincerely,\n\nYour MANTRA Council\n\nThis proposal will run for 7 days (168 hours) commencing at 11AM UTC on May 10th, 2024 and ending at 11AM UTC on May 17th. Upon approval, our team will start working on bringing OM to BASE and update the community on its progress.",

      "content": "Dear Community,\n\nI would like to extend my congratulations to the hardworking team at MANTRA for their efforts, particularly with the OM token's transformation into the primary token of MANTRA Chain.\n\nIn the recent announcement, it was stated that starting from April, the staking pools on the current website, app.mantradao.com, will no longer be eligible for earning the 1.35x staking rewards.\n\nhttps://medium.com/@mantrachain/update-to-om-staking-rewards-564ba1d5861d\n\nHowever, there is an issue that needs to be addressed. Some individuals, including myself, are unable to access MANTRA Finance due to our countries not being supported on the platform.\n\nTherefore, I would like to propose the creation of a new community website for OM staking. This platform would enable community members to stake their OM on the Ethereum, BSC, and Polygon networks without requiring registration on MANTRA Finance. \n\nTo accomplish this, I kindly request the following:\n\n1. Identify a developer who can swiftly build and execute on this community staking page.\n2. Give a small development grant of 7,000 OM to the developer to fund the development and implementation of smart contracts and the setup of the new website.\n2. Inclusion of the newly deployed contracts in the 1.35x multiple calculation for OM stakers until the launch of MANTRA Chain Mainnet.\n\nThe platform would then offer a simple UI that allows users to stake in the following pools:\n\nOM on Ethereum\nOM on BSC\nOM on Polygon\n\nI have reached out to some team members, who have informed me that this proposal could be executed if it is approved by the community. Therefore, I urge you to vote in favor if you believe this is a worthwhile initiative.\n\nThank you for your attention and support!",

      "title": "MANTRA DAO Core Proposal: Making OM the main L1 Token for MANTRA Chain (ANSWER)",
      "content": "Dear MANTRA Community, \n\nThe recent community Proposal (https://snapshot.org/#/mantra-dao.eth/proposal/0x81dc371465584cf5168da3cbdfee7f247c2bd871d694c82e3121cbdec285738c) passed with an incredibly large and positive participation. As a result, the team has deliberated on and prepared a plan to accommodate both the existing MANTRA DAO community and the new ecosystem partners (validators, RWA issuers, dapps, etc.) needed to secure and enliven the new L1 MANTRA Chain and ecosystem.\n\n## Reasons for Proposal:\n\nAs the stewards of this project, our goal has always been to build an expansive, sustainable ecosystem that benefits users and developers alike. Bringing the OM token into the center of MANTRA Chain requires that our token model undergo changes to fulfill this vision successfully.\n\nThis proposal puts forward changes regarding:\n- Upgrading OM\n- Staking\n- Newly Issued OM\n- Total Supply\n\n## Proposal Summary:\n\n### Upgrading OM & New Staking:\n\nIn order for OM to become the L1 token of MANTRA Chain, we must implement the necessary infrastructure for OM’s smooth transition onto the cosmos interchain. Therefore we propose establishing a PoS Bridge that will allow users to transfer their EVM-based OM onto the MANTRA Chain upon the mainnet's release - and vice-versa, creating an environment of expansion rather than replacement of EVM OM. To be clear, we are not deprecating the ERC20 OM token. But, this is not all! \n\nMANTRA recognizes that we would not be here without you, the Sherpa community, that has supported us since inception. To give back, we will change our current staking process in order to allow current stakers of OM to benefit from this exciting transition and to start exploring the MANTRA Chain not only once mainnet is live, but also during our upcoming rounds of testnet.\n\nWe will replace the system of compounding rewards, with a new snapshot mechanism that tracks your stake in all eligible staking pools. Stakers can now earn up to a 1.35x multiple on their staked OM until mainnet launch. For this, the entire “OM Upgrade” bucket (see below) has been reserved. To minimize token inflation, the team will assess the amount of OM earned by the community from one week after this proposal passes (assuming it passes) until 2 weeks before mainnet launch, and only distribute the amount earned until then, locking in a maximum amount of 311M OM that can be reached if all 888M existing OM tokens were to reach the 1.35x multiple. The undistributed amount from this “OM Upgrade” bucket will be transferred into the “Community Pool” allocation on the new mainnet. This token pool will be governed by the Sherpas.\n\nWe provide this significant benefit as a symbol of your continued support to the MANTRA ecosystem and to take our community on this exciting next journey with us - a journey that should benefit us all. \n\nFor further information, please have a look at our article on staking changes. https://www.mantraomniverse.com/news/om-staking-faq\n\n### Newly Issued OM:\n\nAt the Chain’s inception, due to the difference in validator staking versus dApp staking, we envisioned a new token ($AUM) to act as a native coin to secure the chain. Given that the recent DAO proposal has instead committed us to upgrading the existing OM dapp token to be a Proof of Stake mainnet coin, we must be able to regularly issue additional OM on MANTRA Chain to allow for the new economics dynamic to work while ensuring network security.\n\nThe Cosmos SDK that we are using to build MANTRA Chain allows for a variable staking inflation between 7% and 12%, based on the percentage of tokens bonded to secure the network. The more OM bonded to  secure the network, the lower the supply inflation. This rate can also be adjusted via governance after mainnet launch.\n\nThe most important reason for this, is to enable a validator ecosystem that will securely propagate blocks on MANTRA Chain. If we were to retain the fixed token supply in the current emissions model, it would be infeasible to efficiently operate and incentivize a robust validator set. Hence , an inflationary token model is necessary for the initial phase of MANTRA’s RWA ecosystem.\n\nAnother reason for this change is its ability to power continued innovation on MANTRA Chain through an elastic token supply. Developers will feel empowered to build ambitious, community-enriching applications when they know the underlying economic framework is equipped to sustain long-term growth.\n\nDeflationary rate for token issuance:\n\nRest assured, we will include a deflationary factor within the model that will continuously decrease the amount of new OM tokens minted. The model we propose meets the needs of a young, rapidly growing ecosystem, while decreasing any token inflation steadily as this ecosystem matures. We plan to reduce OM inflation over time, eventually transitioning to real yield staking once our RWA ecosystem has been sufficiently developed.\n\nNewly minted tokens on a per block basis will be directed to the following stakeholders:\n\n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreiafflxv5ydld6e7ql3qqj446ddiskdkmhfqzbk5dfa2vdlca3mhv4)\n\n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreiegnuw2xawppzcrborcqn6xbzlzuc3qalihsoekaotonbwvw3dk7a)\n\n### New Total Supply:\n\nAfter careful consideration, we have determined that the move from a dApp token to a native-chain coin will require new allocations of OM tokens to allow not just for a smooth transition, but also a thriving chain that will capture value in different areas. Therefore, we propose that new OM be minted and distributed. Our proposed allocation of these tokens is illustrated below, however, please note that we may be required to amend this allocation or other aspects of our tokenomics if requested to do so by the exchanges on which OM is listed, or in response to feedback from regulators.\n\n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreifai2ugxuubnlrw7dexbfkh3apyqg2qizhi2ybmeaincokkwjkmei)\n*Maximum OM to be minted. Final number may be less.\n\nTo read up more on the new token supply, and issuance, we have published an article with further information: \nhttps://www.mantraomniverse.com/news/the-next-generation-of-om-tokenomics\n\n### Next Steps:\n\nUpon the successful approval of this proposal, MANTRA’s Sherpa community will consolidate around a single OM token. In order to facilitate this paradigm shift operationally and make above changes a reality, some of those need to take effect immediately:\n\n(1) Halt the ERC20 OM staking rewards on MANTRA Finance and app.mantradao.com for stakers. (Single Asset & LP pools).\n\n(2) Accrue rewards via the new snapshotting mechanism to stakers one week after this proposal passed, with users able to claim up to 1.35x of their staked OM. These new OM tokens will be claimable upon mainnet launch and the reward multiplier is subject to the total time staked as well as number of tokens.\n\n(3) Announce the mechanics snapshotting process across all eligible staking pools within Q1 in order to facilitate the allocation mentioned in (2).\n\n(4) Remaining token allocations from previous tokenomics will be nullified to bundle resources in preparation of the launch of the MANTRA Chain testnet and mainnet, giving us greater flexibility to meet the demands of an L1.\n\n### Conclusions:\nThe steps outlined in this proposal present a distinct opportunity to foster growth and strengthen MANTRA’s  ecosystem, along with the Sherpa community. Although the community's proposition to establish OM as the L1 token of the MANTRA Chain comes with its own set of challenges, we acknowledge the enthusiasm and support it has garnered, and we are fully dedicated to transforming this vision into a tangible reality.\n\nAs these are important times for all sherpas, our team will remain attentive to all social media channels to support an open discussion about the above. \n\nPlease also take a moment to read through the two supporting medium articles we published around this proposal:\n\nOM Staking FAQ: https://www.mantraomniverse.com/news/om-staking-faq\nThe next generation of OM tokens: https://www.mantraomniverse.com/news/the-next-generation-of-om-tokenomics\n\nThis proposal will run for 7 days (168 hours) commencing at 11AM UTC on February 21st, 2024 and ending at 11 AM UTC on February 28th, 2024.",

      "title": " Making OM the main L1 Token for MANTRA Chain",
      "content": "As an early supporter and large token holder, I have spoken to many community members about  the upcoming launch of the AUM token.\n \nFrom questions in the TG channels, it has become clear that there is an ongoing confusion about the introduction of AUM as the native MANTRA Chain token.\nFurthermore, a lot of momentum has been building up around the MANTRA Chain Testnet launch and its big potential in the last couple of weeks.\nThis is not just positive for MANTRA but also for OM holders as the MANTRA ecosystem is seeing significant growth in all areas from user number, staked OM and more.\n \nThus, instead of bringing in a brand-new L1 token for MANTRA Chain (AUM token), I believe it would be beneficial for the project to upgrade the OM token and make it the only/main token once the MANTRA Chain goes live.\n \n# Reasons for Proposal:\nConsidering the strong brand of MANTRA and the recognition OM has, I believe using OM at the core of the MANTRA Ecosystem would make the most sense.\nThis move can potentially kickstart the MANTRA Chain Mainnet launch and open up lots of possibilities. Here are a few thoughts on this:\n\nThere are 7.7K OM holders on ETH, and getting them on board with the MANTRA Chain Mainnet could quickly onboard a substantial user base, adding value and attention to the project.\nThe MANTRA Chain Testnet started with the AUM token, but it would be more sensible to keep things simple and have everything under the OM umbrella. This way attention and use cases would be directed towards the original OM token - benefiting its holders and the community.\n \nIf technically possible, I would like to propose to the team & council to consider:\n \n·         To consolidate the planned AUM tokens with the existing OM tokens under one umbrella rather than having 2 different tokens.\n·         To migrate OM from EVM to the Cosmos ecosystem\n·         To run MANTRA Testnet phase 2 with OM as the chain token\n \n \n# Proposal Summary:\n \nAs an active community member, I want to see OM and MANTRA succeed, but do not know enough about the technical feasibility.\nTherefore, if approved by the DAO vote, I would like to ask the MANTRA DAO team & council to look into this proposal and to prepare the next steps.\n \nFeasibility Report for making OM the L1 token of MANTRA Chain:\n \n- Technical aspects (Can it be done? How can it be done?)\n- Possible timelines\n- What happens next\n \nThank you for taking the time to vote on this proposal",

      "content": "As part of our ongoing commitment to building a sustainable and resilient ecosystem, the MANTRA Council has been reworking the staking rewards and planning their migration to the new MANTRA Finance platform. Our focus remains on delivering long-term value to our Sherpa community, and we believe that this change will contribute to the strength, longevity and safety of $OM.\n\nIn line with the previously passed proposal to initiate rewarded staking pools on MANTRA Finance, we want to propose a complete staking pool migration with updated timelines and more detailed information. \n\nWe propose this strategic migration of our existing staking pools to the new MANTRA Finance platform to commence before the end of 2023, and to last several weeks in total to allow for a smooth transition for all Sherpas. \n\nAmple communications on exact timelines will be provided by the team in due course.\n\nReasons for Proposal:\nThe migration aims to optimize the allocation of $OM rewards for the benefit of the community and align the staking product with the project's overall strategic development.\n\nThe council is proposing the above change for three main reasons:\n\n- Enhanced Sustainability: By migrating our staking pools to MANTRA Finance, we are implementing a more effective allocation strategy. This reallocation will ensure that $OM is reserved for the most impactful use cases within the existing and emerging MANTRA ecosystem, thus enhancing the long-term sustainability of $OM.\n\n- Regulation: In a world where ambiguous regulations can negatively affect blockchain based projects, moving the staking pools to the compliant MANTRA Finance platform mitigates certain risks and aligns $OM more closely with the future MANTRA ecosystem direction.\n\n- Streamlined Ecosystem Airdrops: The migration will also improve the management of future ecosystem airdrops, ensuring fair and efficient distributions. Well-structured airdrops will continue to foster greater community support, while establishing a solid foundation for future product developments.\n\nProposal Summary:\n\nMigration Timeline: The proposed migration of staking pools to the new MANTRA Finance platform will commence before the end of 2023 and last several weeks. This gradual process will enable our community to seamlessly transition to the new platform while minimizing disruptions.\n\n1. Migration process begins.\n2. Over the following weeks: There will be a period of co-existence of the same staking pools on the existing legacy app and the new MANTRA finance staking product.\n3. Rewards will gradually migrate to the MANTRA Finance platform until 100% of rewards have shifted over.\n4. Migration ended: There will be no more active $OM staking pools on the app.mantradao.com website and the team will phase out the websites staking product.\n\nAffected Pools:\n\n$OM on Ethereum\n$OM on BSC\n$OM on Polygon\nUni OM V2/ETH\nOM/BNB\nOM-WETH LP\n\nCouncil’s Comments:\n\nIn summary, this proposal seeks to optimize the allocation of $OM rewards and streamline the ecosystem's rewards distribution, with the migration process set to commence before the 2023 year ends. We believe that these changes are essential to the continued growth and sustainability of the MANTRA ecosystem and preparing it for the future.\n\nThe MANTRA Council is committed to building this future with $OM remaining a robust and valuable asset. We thank our Sherpa community for their ongoing support, and together, we can create a resilient, compliant and enduring ecosystem.\n\nThis proposal will run for 7 days (168 hours) commencing at 10AM UTC on November 8, 2023 and ending at 10 AM UTC on November 15, 2023. The changes specified will start taking effect before the end of the 2023 year. The team will provide the updated timelines on the migration in due course.\n\n~ The Council",

      "title": "MANTRA Core Proposal – Update to  $OM Staking Reward Allocations",
      "content": "MANTRA has always focused on building forward-thinking products and services that offer long-term value for the community and ecosystem.\n\nThe Council believes certain changes to the ecosystem rewards would strengthen MANTRA as an ecosystem and improve $OM’s longevity and resilience during the prolonged challenging market conditions. \n\nAs such, we are proposing some of the $OM Ecosystem Rewards to be allocated to the new $OM staking pools on the MANTRA Finance platform.\n\n### Reasons for Proposal:\nThe Council has proposed the above change for two main reasons:\n\n1. To support the long-term sustainability of $OM by implementing a more effective allocation strategy that reserves $OM for the most effective use cases.\n \n2. To improve the management of future ecosystem airdrops.\n\nTogether, these changes aim to strengthen the ecosystem’s foundation and ensure MANTRA remains sustainable for years to come. An effective allocation of $OM and well-managed airdrops will help maintain community support and lay the groundwork for future product developments.\n\n### Proposal Summary:\nThe details for the changes in $OM Staking Rewards are provided in the table below:\n \n![Update to OM Staking Reward Allocations.jpeg](ipfs://bafkreibn7jea5i6luqhaofosguuadxqcqazy447qoxzrda7vz2g7lzeraq)\n    \n- Staking rewards will be gradually reduced every 2 weeks starting August 1st on ZENTEREST, as well as $OM Naked Staking and $OM LP Staking pools on Ethereum, BSC, and Polygon;\n- Staking rewards will be added to new pools on MANTRA Finance starting on August 15th 2023\n\nPlease also note that the 25% reward reduction above relates only to the amount of $OM being distributed. This does not directly correlate to the APR that your $OM will accrue.\n\n### Council’s Comments:\nWe strongly believe these adjustments are necessary steps in continuing to build a sustainable ecosystem that is well positioned for the future. We appreciate the community's feedback and input during the proposal period to ensure the final changes reflect the goals and needs of the ecosystem as a whole.\n\nWe will run this proposal for 7 days (168 hours) commencing at 10 AM UTC on Thursday July 20th 2023 and ending at 10 AM UTC on Thursday July 27th 2023. The changes specified will take effect on August 1st 2023 at 12 AM UTC should the proposal pass.\n\n~ The Council",

      "title": "Partner Proposal - HeliSwap Development Grant ",
      "content": "Dear MANTRA Sherpa community, \n\nWe, the HeliSwap team, would like to propose a grant to support our growing project, a decentralized exchange (DEX) platform that we have been building and have launched on the Hedera Hashgraph network that shares similar values with MANTRA DAO. As you may know, cross-community relationships are essential to the growth and success of the overall decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem and this is something also well ingrained within the MANTRA community. We believe that supporting HeliSwap aligns with MANTRA DAO’s mission and celebrates the cross-platform relationship that has already been established.\n\nThe purpose of this grant is to help us build new and meaningful products for HeliSwap that will also benefit the MANTRA DAO community in the future. At HeliSwap we have already demonstrated our commitment to innovation and decentralization and proven a strong pillar for our intercommunal relationship. \n\nReasons for proposal\n\nOver the past months, the OM token, as well as the Sherpa community, has benefited from our close relationship. Most recently with the creation of the $OM <> $HELI yield farm to celebrate both communities. At HeliSwap, we made the OM token an integral part of our platform and with that in mind, we want the MANTRA DAO community to continue to benefit even more from our DEX platform by using many different products.\n\nWe believe that providing financial support can accelerate our growth to ultimately becoming the dominant DeFi project on Hedera. Our team has reached several milestones in a short period of time and with those reached, we are now approaching the MANTRA DAO Governing Council with our ambitious plan for the future, in which we see the MANTRA DAO community playing an important and integral role.\n\nCouncil’s Comment\n\n“HeliSwap has shown that they are able to return the trust that we as a community have put in them, rewarding the Sherpas with not just access to their platform, but also with innovative products. HeliSwap launched the first “Lockdrop” and “Claimdrop” products on Hedera and continues to amaze us with their very transparent and community-focused approach. We see continued mutual support and believe that by supporting HeliSwap, we will be able to consistently generate benefits for the MANTRA DAO community in the short- mid- and long-term.”\n\nProposal Summary\n\nWe propose to allocate a total of 14M OM tokens, vested over 7 months, that will be used to fund the development of our new features and products which will benefit both communities, facilitating further cross-chain and DeFi integrations.\n\nAs HeliSwap, we have already identified several areas of development that could be funded through this Grant, including:\n\n1. Development of new liquidity pools to enhance trading options for OM token holders;\n2. Development of more enhanced DeFi features that help HeliSwap leverage the apparent gap in DeFi products on Hedera;\n3. Integration with the MetaMask wallet that would provide easier access for our community to the platform;\n4. Per user analytics that allow users to take financial control of their positions.\n\nWe will run this proposal for 8 days (192 hours) commencing at 10 AM UTC on the 22nd of March 2023, and will have the proposal take effect immediately at 10 AM UTC on the 30th of March 2023 should the proposal pass.\n\nThank you for your support, \n\nThe HeliSwap Team",

As such, MANTRA DAO will be increasing its liquidity provision engagements through a MANTRA Grant that will see a new $OM token investor and supporter entering the ecosystem.\n\nLiquidity providers play a crucial role in any crypto ecosystem by providing liquidity and depth to trading markets and using different proprietary trading strategies. Firms that provide liquidity commit to the projects with whom they partner, and are incentivized to see the token and project succeed.\n\nThe Governing Council has decided to initiate a core proposal that will offer the opportunity for a new strategic liquidity provider to receive a grant to continue its efforts to expand the MANTRA OMniverse and the $OM token’s reach, as well as improve and deepen liquidity conditions for the $OM token.\n\nCouncil quorum has been achieved, as required for a core proposal to be initiated, and the Council has voted in favor.\n\nGrants Recipient Summary:\nThis proposal is a Request for Proposal for this chosen, reputable liquidity provider to apply to receive this grant.\n\nProposal Summary:\nThe Governing Council has reviewed and carefully considered the terms that the liquidity provider had offered, and has agreed in favor of this Grant Proposal.  We are therefore proposing to allocate $OM tokens through an official grant for the purpose of managing $OM token’s liquidity on both centralized and decentralized exchanges in which the $OM token is listed.\n\nAmount of Funds Requested:\n25 Million $OM Tokens\n\nFunds Allocation Breakdown:\n25 million $OM tokens will be sent from the MANTRA Grants wallet to the liquidity provider in order for it to initiate $OM liquidity on both centralized and decentralized exchanges in which the $OM token is listed and active.\n\nMilestones:\nTerms of Engagement agreed upon for both parties with continued development taking effect on February 6th, 2023\nAgreement term expires on February 5th, 2024\n\nProposed Phases:\nIf passed, the Council proposes to review the above proposal at regular intervals to make additional adjustments as needed.\n\nCouncil’s Comments:\nWe are excited to recommend the engagement of this liquidity provider, and the value it will bring to our ecosystem. We encourage our Sherpas to also respond to this proposal by voting in favor of the proposal. We look forward to working closely with our partners to create a thriving and expansive ecosystem for MANTRA.\n\nWe will run this proposal for 5 days (120 hours) commencing at 12 PM UTC on January 30th, 2023, and if passed, will have the proposal take effect immediately on February 4th, 2023 at 12 PM UTC.\n\n~The Council",

After the month is over, the council will reassess the effectiveness of the strategy and make further decisions accordingly.\n\n- $OM Naked Staking on Ethereum: $OM token rewards will be reduced by 5% every week.\n- $OM Supplying on ZENTEREST (Ethereum): $OM token rewards will be reduced by 10% every week.\n- $OM Naked and LP Staking on Binance Smart Chain: $OM token rewards will be reduced by 50% every 2 weeks.\n\nPlease also note that the percentage of rewards reduction above is in relation to the amount of $OM tokens being distributed. It is NOT in direct relation to the APR that your $OM tokens will be accruing.\n\nRegarding the Cosmos (ATOM) Delegator Rewards, $OM token rewards for Delegator Rewards participants will be reduced to zero. In other words, MANTRA’s Delegator Rewards will no longer be active.\n\nHowever, if you have participated in the $ATOM Delegator Rewards program in January 2023, you are still eligible to receive your $OM rewards in the beginning of February 2023.\n\nIn the meanwhile, you are encouraged to move your staked $OM from Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain to Polygon network in order to enjoy the low gas fees.\n\nCouncil’s Comments:\nThe Council proposes to review the above proposal at the end of February and will make further adjustments as needed.\n\nAs an evolving ecosystem, MANTRA is excited to introduce and launch our upcoming products and services, and believe that the above changes will be beneficial to the process.\n\nWe will run this proposal for 7 days (168 hours) commencing at 10 AM UTC on January 20th, 2023 and will have the proposal take effect immediately on January 27th, 2023 at 10 AM UTC should the proposal pass.\n\n~ The Council ",

      "content": "As MANTRA grows and evolves into a fully fledged vertically-integrated and regulatory compliant blockchain ecosystem, MANTRA DAO will be leading our grants program to support a variety of projects, groups, and individuals to drive the future of our ecosystem. Our initiative to continually grow the MANTRA ecosystem means that we will be looking to support one of our ecosystem’s most ambitious projects yet; MANTRA Chain.\n\nProject Summary:\n\nMANTRA Chain is a proprietary blockchain built on Tendermint Core using the Cosmos SDK. \n\nDeveloped with a vision to become a permissionless blockchain protocol purposely built to support regulatory compliant applications, MANTRA Chain will power MANTRA’s vertically-integrated ecosystem where Sherpa builders can build a wide variety of new decentralized and permissioned applications in a safe and secure manner.\n\nBenefits to the MANTRA ecosystem:\n\nA significant portion of MANTRA Chain’s total supply of its native token AUM, which is scheduled to be released in 2023, will be allocated to airdrops to OM stakers. \n\nIn addition, those who vote on this proposal will receive our first MANTRA Governance NFT and may be eligible for an additional AUM airdrop.\n\nThis will be the first of our efforts to expand upon our vision for OM to become the token that captures the value generated by partner projects within our ecosystem by building synergies between the AUM and OM tokens.\n\nWith the significant benefits proposed above for the MANTRA ecosystem and OM stakers alike, the Council has decided to initiate a “Core Proposal” vote for MANTRA Labs to receive a grant to continue its efforts to expand the MANTRA OMniverse.\n\nGrant Criteria Summary:\n\nOverall, we find that MANTRA Labs & MANTRA Chain fulfill our grants criteria, such as:\n\nBeing Open Source and built in the spirit of the open source movement, including plans to share open code repositories, as well as general transparency from the team.\n\nHaving Clear Value that will benefit the broader MANTRA ecosystem and community in a compelling way.\n\nShowing Ability to Execute with a proven track record of being able to deliver quality products on time to the MANTRA ecosystem.\n\nHaving Uniqueness & Innovation with features such as its decentralized identity (DID) module, yield engine, real world asset tokenization engine, and more.\n\nPlanning Clear Use of Funds that includes transparent use of proceeds, and a roadmap to which the team will be held accountable.\n\nGrant Terms:\n\nThe MANTRA Chain team will be self-operating and independently accountable for deliverables and execute upon the formulated strategy and plan. \n\nThe team will work closely with the Governing Council to ensure they are in the best position to be integrated within the MANTRA ecosystem. \n\nThe team will give regular updates at different stages of their development to make sure that product and build-out fit within the overall missions and initiatives of MANTRA.\n\nMilestones & Timeline:\n\nThe MANTRA Chain team will be expected to adhere to its timeline to fulfill the defined objectives of the grant, including: \n\nSet-up legal structures and team required, including the MANTRA Chain Foundation.\n\nPublish a MANTRA Chain Whitepaper that will serve as the guiding principles for the chain development.\n\n\nPresent development roadmap by MANTRA Labs with a timeline for development and launch; any deviations from timeline will be analyzed and explained.\n\nRegular monthly update and check-in intervals to disclose on development progress.\n\nGrant Allocation Schedule: \n\nA total of 27,000,000 OM tokens will be initially allocated towards the MANTRA Chain Grant with the total grant allocation amount and token released each batch over a total of 12 months.\n\nAn initial 5,000,000 OM tokens will be allocated for release from the MANTRA Grants Wallet in January 2023 with 3,000,000 OM allocated towards legal structure setup and 2,000,000 OM to cover expenses, overhead, developer costs, and other costs directly related to chain development. \n\n2,000,000 OM tokens will be allocated from the MANTRA Grants Wallet for release at the end of every month from February to December 2023 to cover expenses, overhead, developer costs, and other costs directly related to chain development.\n\nThis grant will continue throughout 2023, but will be reviewed every 3 months to reflect OM price movements. It can also be reviewed earlier if there’s any significant price changes.\n\nCouncil’s Comments:\n\nThe Council proposes to review the above proposal at regular intervals to make additional adjustments as needed.\n\nThe MANTRA Labs team will become one of many projects contributing to the MANTRA ecosystem; the team has already made significant contributions in expanding OM’s utility since the token’s release in August 2020.\n\nHaving worked very closely with MANTRA Labs, we are confident in the team’s ability to deliver on its milestones and would like to continue incentivizing the team to work closely with MANTRA DAO to create a thriving and expansive ecosystem for MANTRA.\n\nWe will run this proposal for 14 days (336 hours) commencing at 11 AM UTC on December 15th 2022, and will have the proposal take effect immediately on December 29th 2022 at 11 AM UTC should the proposal pass.\n\n~The Council",

      "content": "As part of Season 0 of the MANTRA Grants program, the Governing Council has identified several high-growth projects that will be further progressing the MANTRA ecosystem. The Governing Council sees benefit in allocating OM tokens from the MANTRA Grants Wallet to provide resources to further benefit the MANTRA ecosystem through these projects. The Council has voted in favor of inviting HeliSwap to be the first potential project and Grant Partner for MANTRA.\n\nA Core Proposal for Heliswap Grant Proposal #1 has been initiated by the Governing Council to offer the chance for HeliSwap to receive a grant to expand and bring benefits to the MANTRA OMniverse.\n\nCouncil quorum has been achieved as required for a Core Proposal to be initiated, and the Council has unanimously voted in favor.\n\nGrant Recipient Project Summary:\nHeliSwap is bringing DeFi to the Hedera ecosystem by launching its first DEX and DAO, supporting swaps between HTS, ERC-20s and HBAR, all in a cost effective, green and permissionless way for people to trade their favorite assets.\nThe development of the HeliSwap DEX is a joint venture between MANTRA and the blockchain development firm LimeChain.\nProposal Summary:\n\nThe Governing Council has agreed in favor to review the terms of the Grants Proposal set out by the HeliSwap team to provide additional interoperability and use cases to the OM token by officially introducing and supporting the OM token in the Hedera Hashgraph ecosystem. OM token holders will benefit from being immediately able to use the created $OM/$HBAR liquidity pool to swap tokens in the Hedera ecosystem.\n\nAs per HeliSwap’s Grant Application, the HeilSwap team is requesting MANTRA to allocate OM tokens, as well as support through a Grant for the purposes of:  \n\nProviding initial liquidity on $OM/$HBAR liquidity pool on HeliSwap\n\nThe Council agrees to review this proposal at the proposed phases and make adjustments to the liquidity amount, or to remove the liquidity entirely from the LP pool and return the assets to the MANTRA wallets at MANTRA’s discrecion.\n\nAmount of funds requested:\n\n$200,000 equivalent in $OM for Liquidity Provision on $OM/$HBAR \n\nFunds Allocation Breakdown: \n\n$200,000 of allocated funds will be sent from the MANTRA Grants wallet to the MANTRA Foundation Wallet where $100,000 value in $OM at the current market price, will be swapped in multiple batches to avoid creating large asset volatility, for $HBAR on the open market. The created LP tokens will not be staked and instead remain in the MANTRA wallet.\n\nThe $100,000 equivalent in $OM & $100,000 equivalent in $HBAR will be used to supply the $OM/$HBAR pair on www.heliswap.io. \n\nMilestones:\n\nHeliSwap DEX goes live with liquidity pools.\nAllocated funds sent from the MANTRA Grants wallet to the MANTRA Foundation Wallet\n$OM/$HBAR pair created and available to swap on www.heliswap.io \n\nProposed Phases:\n\nIf passed, the Council proposes to review the above proposal at regular intervals to make additional adjustments as needed.\n\nCouncil's Comments:\n\nThe Hedera Foundation and MANTRA have joined together in providing support to HeliSwap’s efforts in bringing value to both our ecosystems. \n\nAs a strong layer 1 blockchain, the Hedra ecosystem presents a unique opportunity to bring OM tokens to many members of Hedera, as well as open doors for Sherpas to more easily access the Hedera ecosystem.\n\nHaving worked very closely with the HeliSwap team, including successfully integrating the Hedera Bridge Support $OM to HTS through Hashport. Together, we are confident in the team’s ability and are clear on the benefit that a Grant provides by allowing Sherpas to swap in the $OM/$HBAR pool, while also opening opportunities for long term HeliSwap supporters for lucrative rewards and airdrops. Details of these rewards can be referred to in the HeliSwap tokenomics.\n\nWe will run this proposal for 5 days (120 hours) commencing at 10 am UTC on 29 September 2022, and will have the proposal take effect immediately on 4 October 2022 at 10 am UTC should the proposal pass.",

As we begin Cycle 2 of the MANTRA Governing Council, we are proposing the following to take effect immediately on August 18th, 2022 should the proposal pass. \n\n- Appointment of MANTRA Governing Council for Cycle 2; and\n- Expansion of Maximum Council seats from five to nine.\n\n I.                    Appointment of MANTRA Governing Council for Cycle 2\n\nFirst, three of the MANTRA Governing Council from Cycle 1 and those responsible for all the day-to-day strategy and operations for the project, John Patrick Mullin, Will Corkin and Rodrigo Quan Miranda, have agreed to serve a second term. \n\nSecond, the current MANTRA Governing Council officially nominates Jayant Ramanand, Dustin McDaniel, Mark Cheng, and Alessio Quagliani to newly join the Governing Council for Cycle 2.\n\nThese nominees are all exceptional individuals who have made substantial contributions to MANTRA over the last two years. We are fully confident that they are the best candidates to fulfill the roles and responsibilities within the MANTRA Governing Council and the further expansion of the ecosystem globally.\n\nMANTRA Governing Council Cycle 2 Seats:\n \n1. John Patrick Mullin - MANTRA Co-Founder - Second Term\n2. Will Corkin - MANTRA Co-Founder - Second Term\n3. Rodrigo Quan Miranda - MANTRA Co-Founder - Second Term\n4. Jayant Ramanand - Staking & Infrastructure Lead - First Term\n5. Dustin McDaniel - Head of Community - First Term\n6. Mark Cheng - Founder of GameFi Ventures & Senior Advisor to Animoca Brands - First Term\n7. Alessio Quagliani - Founder & CEO of Hex Trust - First Term\n  \nII.                  Expansion of Maximum Council Seats to 9\n\nAs MANTRA grows, expanding the maximum number of council seats to nine will allow for more voices and minds to improve MANTRA’s governance, grants and ecosystem goals. It also means more decentralization in our collective decision-making abilities as well as bringing in fresh ideas.\n\nWe will run this proposal for 7 days (168 hours) commencing at 10:00 EST on August 10th, 2022 and will have the proposal take effect immediately on August 18th, 2022 at 10:00 EST should the proposal pass.  This will allow us to begin the second cycle of the MANTRA Governing Council with our new Council in place.",

      "content": "From Dec. 14 09:47:37 PM UTC to Dec. 14 10:51:17 PM UTC, there were price feed discrepancies related to issues CoinmarketCap was facing. This resulted in the liquidation of a number of suppliers on the platform. This issue has since been fixed and the correct prices are now showing on ZENTEREST. \n\nFor those Sherpa suppliers that were liquidated through this incident, we would like to propose a solution for the complete reconciliation of unfairly liquidated assets. \n\nGiven that a number of different assets were liquidated, we propose to have the reconciled amounts be repaid in zenOM tokens instead of each individual zenASSET. This allows the MANTRA DAO Foundation to save treasury cash assets. \n\nThe zenOM given on non-OM liquidations would be paid at a premium to the USD value of the liquidated assets. This ensures that everyones' collateral factor will be restored, and in addition compensate those users with a premium to the USD value of their holdings prior to the liquidations. We are proposing for the premium paid in zenOM to be 20%. This means that for every dollar of non-OM zenAsset that was liquidated, the user will receive $1.2 dollars of zenOM in return. \n\nWe see several benefits here:\n\n1. The MANTRA DAO foundation saves cash treasury assets for other beneficial uses.\n2. Users get reimbursed in full USD value, plus a 20% premium.\n3. Users retain the ability to sell their zenOM if they so please (at a premium) in order to buy back whatever asset they had liquidated. \n4. MANTRA DAO reserves the right to buy back OM with cash savings. \n\nWe will be spending roughly 8M OM on this proposal. 2.7M to cover the 2.7M OM liquidated and an additional 5.5M to cover the remainder + 20% premium. Again, this will be paid back in zenOM so that users' collateral levels go back to normal (for users who do not have zenOM enabled as collateral, they will have to perform this action before their collateral levels go back to normal). \n\nWe will run this proposal for 24 hours and will be executing the airdrop tomorrow should the proposal pass. \n\n🕉🕉🕉,\nThe Council",

      "title": "MY OTHER PROPOSAL",
      "content": "SUMMARY\nxINCHa is an ERC20 wrapper for the 1INCH token and the 1inch staking process. xINCHa holders express a long term bullish view on the value of 1INCH and 1inch staking rewards. xINCHa is a set-and-forget token, requiring no active participation from holders. xINCHa holders participate in governance via the Buchanan Mandate, where voting decision-making/deliberation is anchored around the doctrine of center-right economist James Buchanan. Read more about Mandated Governance here.\nGOVERNANCE\nxINCHa: Buchanan votes to lower frictions and remove restrictions for users of the protocol. In exercising the Mandate, the fund seeks to promote a nimble, lightweight and efficient protocol that limits vested bureaucratic interests and constrains the power entrusted to governance.\nSWAP FEE\nThe swap fee is a fixed fee charged on each trade completed via the liquidity protocol. In order to support high volumes of low cost transactions, the fund votes for a 0.2% swap fee, slightly below industry standard. The 1inch AMM is differentiated in that LPs capture arbitrage and frontrunning profit in a way that competitors do not. Recognizing that 1inch has alternative sources of fee collection and exists in a competitive space, the fund supports a lower swap fee.\nDECAY TIME\nDecay time is a technical innovation by the 1inch team to slow the change in spot price, capturing a share of arbitrage profits for LPs at the expense of arbitrageurs. The fund votes for a 4:00 minute decay, inline with current rough community consensus. The fund will continue to monitor community discourse, but neither instance of xINCH will take an opinionated view on Decay Time until more information is known about the governance implications of this highly technical protocol configuration.\nREFERRAL REWARD\nThe referral reward is collected by the dApp, wallet, or other integrator directing trades to 1inch Liquidity Protocol. While there is a legitimate need to encourage community development and reward beneficial integrations, the referral reward should be set at a modest level to limit capture of protocol revenue by rent-seeking actors. The fund votes for the minimum allowable level of 5% for this governance metric.\nGOVERNANCE REWARD\nThe governance reward is the share of swap and price impact fees to be allocated to token holders for staking in governance. Buchanan's work on constitutional economics posited that the most efficient systems had a clear and transparent alignment of incentives for both the users and the governors of the system. In order to attract and maintain the most robust governance participation by stakeholders invested in the protocols success, the fund votes for a max 10% allocation to governance reward.\nPRICE IMPACT FEE\nThe price impact fee is an innovative addition from 1inch, contributing to the growing toolset of AMM management and governance. Charged on top of the swap fee, it is proportionate to the price slippage of a trade. This feature attempts to add a dynamic pricing component, targeting traders with low elasticity of demand, i.e., those who are willing to pay more for immediate settlement. The fund advocates for a high-end price impact fee as it is precisely the type of process architecture design that supports protocol users instead of allowing value leakage to outsiders. With that said, the fund supports a higher fee value without completely maxing out the fee, in order to maintain a low friction, high efficiency protocol. Some elements of the Buchanan Mandate are in slight conflict on this voting metric, but we believe a 80% price impact fee strikes the correct balance.\nREWARD DISTRIBUTION\nBuchanan's work on constitutional economics emphasized that undue administrative and bureaucratic power tended to burden systems with waste and corruption. Consistent with those precepts, the fund supports a reward distribution where the majority share is distributed to token holders (termed \"Governance\"). The fund votes for 80% allocation to Governance, a 15% allocation to Operation and a 5% allocation to Referrers.\n",
