      "content": "I spoke about this briefly in the Discord. I'm adding it here as we need to make a decision and not leave our DAO treasury in limbo in a multisig. For reference, we haven't bridged our DAO funds to Optimism due to delays around Optimism's bridge. I wanted to give it until the end of September.. and here we are.\n\nAt this point, I want to propose we move our DAO to Arbitrum which is still an optimistic rollup as we voted on. The issue is we can’t use a multisig to bridge liquidity because Gnosis doesn’t support Optimism or visa versa but Arbitrum does. So I am proposing we put our DAO on Arbitrum.\n\nFurther, I don’t think we have gotten enough support or love from the delegates (which was a major factor in us looking to move to Optimism over Arbitrum for the DAO function) to honor being native to any rollup and at this point I think we are better optimizing for the best tech for every unique function. One function being the products and the other function being governance.\n\nThis also shouldn't be read as a knock on Optimism. I very much support their team and ecosystem and I want to grow in conjunction with them. \n\nFurther, this doesn't exclude that we work with Optimism.  I think we still launch our main product, SMART Yield V2 to Optimism AS WELL AS Arbitrum.",

      "content": "Sorry for the title!\n\nDAO member ECAndre started a discussion over the weekend about enrolling BarnBridge in a pilot program for Olympus DAO's Pro platform:\n- https://forum.barnbridge.com/t/propose-to-accumulate-bond-eth-liquidity-with-olympus-pro/487/5\n\nFor those unfamiliar, Olympus Pro is a smart contract stack that makes it possible for a DAO to sell its governance token (in this case, BOND) for shares of secondary liquidity pools (e.g. BOND pool on Uniswap). This allows the DAO to control its governance token's liquidity to an extent, as it is obviously incentivized to not withdraw its own liquidity. \n- You can learn more about OlympusDAO's bonding mechanism here: https://docs.olympusdao.finance/main/\n- You can learn more about the Olympus Pro offering here: https://docs.olympusdao.finance/pro/\n\nECAndre has proposed 15,000 BOND be allocated over one month to fund such an effort. This 15,000 BOND would need to be targeted at a specific liquidity pool. The two mentioned in the forum discussion are:\n- **BOND / USDC** on Uniswap v2, as this would allow the DAO to farm the hard-coded liquidity mining program and reduce BOND emissions as a result\n- **BOND / ETH** on Sushiswap, as this would create the ETH-denominated liquidity that is lacking currently\n\nThe voting options on this poll are to assess:\n1. Interest in having the pilot\n2. Target of the pilot\n\nPlease bring comments, questions, or concerns to either the linked forum discussion or the #Governance channel in the BarnBridge Discord. ",

      "content": "The UMA team has graciously accommodated our request to build out a template KPI option program that can be repeated across any number of SMART Alpha pools. Such a KPI option program could be used to bootstrap secondary liquidity for SA assets, making the week-long lockup less intimidating for potential users, and importantly, making it possible for these assets to be further used in lending markets (i.e. you need to be able to liquidate an asset to accept it as collateral) and options markets (e.g. junior positions not volatile enough for you?)\n\nThe following link details how the KPI option program would run. Essentially, the program would pay out up to a maximum amount of BOND that is determined by a) the TVL at the end of the program, and b) how often epochs were competitive or not. **KPI option tokens would be distributed to users providing secondary liquidity for the junior and senior assets associated with the ETHUSD and BTCUSD pools.** The payout function that determines how many BOND are distributed for a given outcome is provided in the link below.\n- https://github.com/UMAprotocol/UMIPs/blob/master/Implementations/smart-alpha.md\n\nThis signal vote is to determine community interest in providing 10,000 BOND from the DAO to trial a month-long KPI option program. 5,000 would be allocated to ETHUSD and 5,000 to BTCUSD - these figures represent the maximum payout possible. Success of the program would be determined by how much secondary liquidity was attracted. The secondary market of choice for now will be Balancer, as it is possible to neutralize asset volatility if you have a modifiable three-asset pool composed of: \n\n1. Underlying Asset (50%)\n2. Junior Asset (50% * Junior Dominance)\n3. Senior Asset (50% - Junior Asset Weight)\n\nIf the program proves successful, we can look to have a longer one for the ETHUSD and BTCUSD pools, as well as further use the template for joint rewards programs with other communities for their asset's SA pools. A more formalized Medium post would be published detailing the rewards pilot program should we move forward with this.",

As we've all learned by now, this is standard practice for adding new (exogenous) assets to lending markets. \n\nThe FEI team has signaled that they will deposit up to $1M in FEI into the pool, should we move ahead with adding it as an asset. This could be critical in unlocking utility for the jTokens we're planning on adding once they have secondary liquidity.

      "content": "With the launch of the BarnBridge Fuse pool via Rari Capital, we are now able as a DAO to curate our own lending market. Importantly, this provides a route forward for our SMART Yield and SMART Alpha assets being used as collateral. For a BarnBridge product ERC-20 to be eligible for us to include in our Fuse pool, it must have a price feed and a minimum of $500k in secondary liquidity. Uniswap v3 addresses both requirements.\n\nIn discussion with the community, a number of users pointed out that we could use our DAO funds to provide liquidity for SMART Yield jTokens to begin with. No user provided an argument against doing so.\n- https://forum.barnbridge.com/t/bootstrapping-our-rari-fuse-pool/435/3\n\nThis vote is to determine whether $1M should be allocated from the DAO treasury for this purpose, and if so, what the prioritized jTokens should be. The reasons for doing so, in short, are: \n- DAO earns LP fees for providing liquidity\n- jTokens gain added utility from the borrowing power available on Rari\n- It becomes possible for users to leverage loop into SY\n\nAs for what jTokens to prioritize, the clearest route forward looks to be a combination of bb_aUSDC (the most liquid Aave pair, and no longer incentivized) and either bb_cDAI, bb_aDAI, or bb_aRAI.\n- bb_cDAI still has an ongoing Sushiswap Onsen pool, which would represent an opportunity cost for users entering the Rari pool instead\n- bb_aDAI has less liquidity than its USDC counterpart, but proved to be popular while incentives were still running\n- bb_aRAI is a new asset and project, but it consistently has high APRs and their community has signaled interest in utilizing the borrowing functionality if available\n\nPlease use the shared forum post to express your views on the matter. If the vote isn't overwhelmingly (80-90%) in favor of a specific outcome, it can go back to the drawing board.",

By creating a link between the BarnBridge DAO and giving, we show our community is truly about working together to provide exceptional services for all. \n\n**Technical Details**\n-\tBarnBridge Benevolent Fund Team Structure\n--\tA team consisting of community members.\n--\tTeam would work on a volunteer basis therefore not receiving compensation for work done as a member of the Fund Team. \n--\ta multi-sig wallet would be used to disperse funds as directed by community vote.\n-\tFrequency\n--\tQuarterly.\n-\tLimitations on Chosen Philanthropies\n--\tA chosen philanthropy cannot receive donations from the fund more than once within a 6-month period.\n-\tCommunity Awareness\n--\tCreation of a BarnBridge DAF through endaoment.org\n--\tPromote Fund and grants across BarnBridge social media accounts.\n--\tCreate a Discord room for discussion about various non-profits the community may want to support.\n--\tFuture BarnBridge community gatherings and in-person volunteering.\n--\tHighlight a specific philanthropy the community wants to support.\n--\tInterview the receiving philanthropy, if applicable.\n--\tMedium post.\n--\tProvide quarterly reporting.\n\n**Argumentation**\n\nFor\n-\tGenerates great publicity and awareness of the BarnBridge DAO.\n-\tCreates potential increase in treasury through increased use of SY, SA, and SE products.\n-\tBinds BarnBridge community members closer together and sets the stage for potential real-world collaboration.\n\nAgainst\n-\tTakes 1% of revenues away from reinvestment opportunities.\n-\tCommunity might be split on which causes to support.\n-\tBarnBridge is a diverse community with a global reach, which may cause consensus issues.

      "content": "Leo Zeng has served as the BarnBridge China community manager over the past three months. He's overseen the buildout of BarnBridge's regional  media presence, created native content on how to use our applications, and has educated local users, funds, and exchanges about what is getting built with BarnBridge. For his efforts to date, which are effectively full-time, he has been compensated with 150 BOND tokens. \n\nIn order for Leo to continue his work, he's asked for the following:\n- A grant of 6,000 USDT to cover the cost of housing his work under a registered Chinese company\n- Compensation of 10,500 USDT for the next three months of work\n\nThis topic has been addressed both on the forum and in the Discord #embassy channel. You can find the forum discussion surrounding the \"pioneer company\" grant here: https://forum.barnbridge.com/t/establishment-of-a-chinese-pioneer-company/371/12  \n\nPlease note that the sum of 10,500 for compensation is a reflection of what the 150 BOND were originally meant to approximate during the first quarter of Leo's work. Given the steep decline in price of BOND, this quarter's compensation was requested to be USDT-denominated. A mix between the two will presumably be best in future quarters. \n",

      "content": "The deployment of SMART Yield on Polygon and its integration with Aave presents an opportunity to pilot a new incentive mechanism on the eve of mainnet SMART Yield rewards coming to a close. The topic has previously been discussed here: https://forum.barnbridge.com/t/implementing-kpi-options-for-polygon-smart-yield/385/3\n\nThis Signal vote is to assess the community support for a KPI (Key Performance Indicator) Options program with the following hallmarks, which were informed by community discussion:\n\n- Strike date of October 31st, 2021\n- 100,000 BOND set aside for potential distribution\n- The function for the KPI would be: **Polygon AAVE TVL * (Polygon Senior TVL / Polygon Junior TVL)** with bounds at 10M and 100M for the KPI output, and bounds of .5 and 1.5 for the TVL ratio modifier\n- Linear vesting of BOND rewards over 3 months following the conclusion of the program\n\n10,000 KPI Options would be minted in total, to be distributed as follows via biweekly randomized snapshots:\n\n- 5,000 to secondary liquidity providers of junior tokens\n- 2,000 to senior depositors in Polygon SMART Yield\n- 1,500 to addresses that have a mainnet senior SMART Yield deposit on August 1st, 2021\n- 1,000 to addresses that have voted in the BarnBridge DAO\n500 to addresses that vote in favor of AIP-23 (i.e. listing BOND on AAVE)\n\nRegarding the 5,000 option tokens to be distributed to junior side participants, these would follow a decaying emission schedule such that initial weeks will give out more than preceding weeks. The 2,000 in senior tokens will mirror this process, with latter weeks giving out more than preceding ones. In both cases, users who remain in the pools week after week will be rewarded, with up to a 100% boost on their pro rata share of rewards after 9 successive weeks (i.e. 1/8th boost every week, starting with a depositor’s second week). \n\nThe point of this snapshot vote is to confirm the seemingly unanimous support for the program reflected in positive forum and Discord conversation. There is still room for changes and improvements - if you find that you agree with the program but would alter certain aspects, feel free to make your opinion known to the community. The final terms of the program would be codified via an official blog post. \n",

The following points from the discourse to date should be noted:\n- $100k - $250k represents a compelling reward range for ImmuneFi hackers, per CEO Travin Keith\n- Bug bounty program funds do not need to be escrowed and could be invested in our own products when payouts are not owed\n- Lack of a bug bounty program has cost BarnBridge points in its DeFi Safety Rating score\n\nPlease feel free to further discuss the vote in the forum or the #Governance channel for the duration of the vote.",

      "title": "Initiate Shield Mining on Nexus Mutual",
      "content": "Nexus Mutual now offers protocol cover for BarnBridge. This means that any depositor into any BarnBridge contract on any network would be covered in the case of material losses due to unexpected contract behavior. \n\nNexus Mutual determines the amount of cover available to be claimed by having Mutual members stake the NXM token in favor of projects they deem to be secure. The distribution of staked NXM is what allocates the Mutual's Ether reserves across supported projects and calculates the cost of insurance. \n\nIn order to incentivize Mutual members to stake NXM in favor of BarnBridge over more established incumbents, BOND rewards could be set aside to subsidize the risk of those who do so. This practice is referred to as \"shield mining.\" A number of other protocols have pursued this strategy, including Bancor, Liquity, and BadgerDAO. The topic has been discussed in both the BarnBridge forum and Discord.\n\n**This Snapshot vote is two-fold:**\n1. **Are you in favor of rewarding 10,000 BOND total over the next year to Nexus Mutual stakers?**\n2. **If yes, should that 10,000 BOND be bought off the market, or taken from DAO reserves?**\n\nThe following arguments have been made in favor of shield mining:\n\n> Nexus Mutual is by far the largest provider of cover in DeFi\n\n> 10,000 BOND for a year could unlock 9-figures worth of cover\n\n> Insurance could attract interested but risk-averse TVL\n\nThe following doubts were cast regarding shield mining:\n\n> The best insurance rate possible would still be 2.6%\n\n> Other insurance solutions are coming online\n\nMy response to the concerns raised is that while protocol cover does not address the issue of insured senior SMART Yield deposits on its own (i.e. it would require subsidization for it to make sense for seniors), it should prove compelling for users of the DAO, the SMART Yield junior tranche, SMART Exposure, SMART Alpha, and SMART Secret over the next year. \n\n**The second part of the vote is whether you would like to see these BOND come from an open market purchase with accrued fee revenues or from existing DAO reserves.**\n\nThe case in favor of an open market purchase:\n\n> Caps the cost of the program in $USD terms\n\n> Takes BOND off of the secondary market\n\n> Preserves DAO BOND reserves\n\nThe case against an open market purchase:\n\n> Would represent 20 - 25% of current DAO stablecoins\n\n> Purchase could be front-run\n\n---\nPlease feel free to discuss the proposal during the vote period on either the #Governance channel or the respective forum thread. Given the potential for split opinions on how to source the BOND, the core team will be participating in this Snapshot.\n",

      "title": "Match the Remaining Bancor Co-Investment",
      "content": "The Bancor community has set aside 1M BNT tokens to match deposits into the BOND/BNT pool. The DAO currently has 50,000 BOND deposited; it has room for another 70,000 - 100,000 BOND at current prices.\n\n**This vote will determine whether the DAO will provide BOND to match the rest of the co-investment, as well as to insure the deposit via Nexus Mutual.** The following reasons were made in favor of this decision:\n\n- Would allow the DAO to earn yield on BOND (from transaction fees) without risking its upside exposure to BOND\n\n- Would result in significant Bancor community turnout in favor of liquidity mining rewards for the BOND/BNT pool, per conversations with relevant stakeholders\n\n-  Would deepen ties with the Bancor community through the accumulation of BNT rewards, on the eve of the launch of Bancor v3\n\nAs Speculor of the Integrations Team pointed out in the preceding forum discussion, DAO treasury funds could be used to insure the overall deposit into the BOND/BNT pool for 2.6% annually. This would cost some $100,000 at current prices, to insure nearly ~$4M. \n\nMark Richardson, an advisor for Bancor, had the following to say regarding this potential decision:\n\n- In short, it is in Bancor’s interests to have a fairly deep source of liquidity for tokens that the community truly believes in. We have found that annexing liquidity on up-and-coming tokens can be of critical importance. If the deepest source of BOND liquidity is on our DEX, then we can drive the majority of volume through our platform, which elevates the profile of Bancor to new communities, and helps to establish a new user base.\n\n- Excellent case studies are WOO and wNXM. In the latter case, controlling a commanding share of the market for a particular token has proven valuable in setting a pool fee that makes liquidity provision highly lucrative; traders really don’t seem too affected by pool fees of 0.5-1% if the slippage compensates for the commission. In such a situation, deep pools become highly performant for both makers and takers, thus satisfying the needs of both halves of the shared platform business model.\n\n- Moreover, TVL is a metric that shouldn’t be taken lightly. The more capital that exists on the Bancor platform, the more attention it receives. Of course, TVL is secondary to volume and turnover numbers in terms of the true performance of the protocol; however, TVL does speak to engagement and general health.\n\n- Speaking only from my own impressions, and not necessarily on behalf of the DAO or passive community members - I have seen this proposal received with enthusiasm on Twitter, and within our telegram channels. I was heavily involved with garnering support for the BOND whitelist status and preparing the community for its decision. I felt then, as I do now, that there is a lot of potential collaboration between our projects. As the Barnbridge platform matures, I expect products such as the jTokens to find a warm welcome inside the Bancor community. ",

      "content": "Over the past few weeks, the core team and community have discussed how to go about incentivizing the C.R.E.A.M. and AAVE integrations for SMART Yield that are launching imminently. These conversations have been quite informative in both the depth of their feedback and the breadth of community participation. The primary takeaways from these conversations have been: \n\n- cUSDC incentivization has demonstrated that subsidies attract TVL, and it behooves the protocol to make use of amenable market conditions (e.g. AAVE liquidity mining rewards, heightened borrowing demand) to go for a TVL land grab at this time\n\n- More sophisticated incentivization mechanisms are possible\n\n- Optimizing for TVL makes sense for protocol revenues, but there are other metrics - namely, secondary market liquidity - that warrant consideration\n\nWith this feedback in mind, this SnapShot vote is meant to assess community sentiment for the following subsidization 10-week schedule:\n\n- **For C.R.E.A.M.:**\n-- USDC: 500 BOND / week\n-- USDT: 250 BOND / week\n-- DAI: 250 BOND / week\n\n- **For AAVE:**\n-- USDC: 10,000 BOND / week \n-- USDT: 4,000 BOND / week\n-- DAI: 2,500 BOND / week\n-- GUSD: 500 BOND / week \n\nThese allotments are roughly in line with the respective liquidity of each asset on both platforms. 10 weeks was chosen as the ideal duration for this style of subsidy as it will provide enough time to see which originators garner the most traction, as well as to determine what subsequent subsidy programs should look like.\n\nVoting \"Yes\" indicates your support for provisioning 180,000 BOND for this effort; \"No\" would not. \n\nPlease refer to the following links for further background on this discussion:\n- Forum Conversation #1: https://forum.barnbridge.com/t/incentivizing-smart-yield-pools/227\n- Forum Conversation #2: https://forum.barnbridge.com/t/bond-subsidies-for-c-r-e-a-m-and-aave/260\n- BarnBurner, May 9th Edition: https://barnburner.substack.com/p/barnburner-may-9th-2021",

      "title": "Seeding the BOND/BNT Bancor Pool",
      "content": "Last month, $BOND was successfully whitelisted on the Bancor DEX. In short, this means that the Bancor Network will supply up to one million BNT tokens (~$7M at time of writing) to the BOND/BNT pool as BOND deposits are made. Bancor’s primary pitch is that it subsidizes impermanent loss for liquidity providers who remain staked for at least 100 days. Currently, the BOND/BNT pool stands at $40,000 worth of liquidity and has seen $140 in volume over the past day.\n\nThe Bancor community has signalled that it would host a vote to provide liquidity mining rewards for the BOND/BNT pool should it grow to a material size first. For the purposes of this vote, material is defined as >$1M worth of available liquidity. For context, such rewards are currently earning liquidity providers in other pools between a 40% and 80% annualized return through $BNT rewards. You can see an overview here: https://app.bancor.network/eth/data\n\nThis Snapshot vote is to assess community support for the following:\n\n- Allocate 25,000 BOND from the DAO Treasury for providing liquidity to the BOND/BNT pool\n- Accumulate BNT rewards for the DAO Treasury in the event of a successful liquidity mining vote among the Bancor Network community\n- Keep the 25,000 BOND in the pool until such time as the community decides it is no longer of value to do so, past the initial 100 day holding period.\n\nThe reasons for doing so are as follows:\n\n- Create additional DEX liquidity for $BOND without diluting existing holders\n- Gaining voting power on Bancor would give the Barnbridge DAO the ability to support proposals on Bancor that are in our best interest (e.g future proposals to whitelist jTokens on Bancor)\n- Build continued goodwill with communities who have made their preference for Bancor clear (e.g. Chainlink)\n\nImportantly, the allocated BOND will be directed to a core-team controlled multisig address, in order to be able to sign votes as well as stake earned BNT (i.e., technical limitations prevent this being entirely DAO-run today). This would represent the first external governance token accumulation done on behalf of the BarnBridge DAO, with the intention being that this specific “metaprotocol governance” multisig would be handed off to the DAO in the future.

      "content": "While the cryptocurrency space is as global as the internet, clear regional divides are reinforced by factors like geographic restrictions on exchanges or language barriers in transmitting a common oral tradition. The most successful projects therefore need to actively allocate resources to seeding communities across these divides. BarnBridge in particular, with its US and European roots, should look to expand its brand recognition and community participation in the APAC region. Of course, APAC is by no means a monolith, but the current composition of the BarnBridge community lends itself to focusing on the China market initially.\n\nThis SnapShot vote is meant to assess $BOND holders’ support for seeding a squad led by Leo (凄凄切切 Leo in the Discord) tasked with community management in China. The squad’s main priorities would be to:\n\n- Create a cohesive media strategy for the Mandarin-speaking crypto community\n- Arrange community events like AMAs, essay competitions, and meet ups\n- Represent BarnBridge at regional industry events \n- Educating centralized exchanges, financial institutions, and funds based in China\n- Acting as a liaison between the BarnBridge core team, the Integration Team, and regional projects looking to integrate with BarnBridge\nModerate community chats on platforms like WeChat\n\nLeo would be compensated 60 BOND per month for his efforts. Efforts that would require additional budgeting would be coordinated via the Integration Team. Compensation for this squad would be reassessed quarterly to account for $BOND price fluctuations and changes to team composition. Moreover, similar discussion rules as found on the community Discord will be enforced to minimize regulatory risk (e.g., no price discussion, no promise of returns, no preferential disclosure of protocol developments).\n\nSuccessful execution by this squad would imply that:\n\n- BarnBridge would enjoy organic community growth in a currently underrepresented region\n- Regional entities are educated about both $BOND and BarnBridge products \n- BarnBridge governance would have successful playbooks for expanding community management efforts into other APAC regions like South Korea, Japan, and the Philippines\n\nA positive quorum of support in this Snapshot vote will result in the next BarnBridge DAO vote including the provisioning of Leo’s compensation.

      "title": "Establishing an Integrations Team",
      "content": "Over the past week, we’ve had a compelling community conversation regarding the appointment of a three-person group that would be responsible for monitoring governance discussions and implementing successful DAO proposals / Snapshot votes. With the feedback received from the community, the core team is proposing that this organization be referred to as the BarnBridge Integrations Team and have the following mandate:\n\n-          To act as a liaison between the community and the core team\n-          To moderate community governance discussions and maintain standardized processes for both pitching ideas and responding to Requests-for-Proposals\n-          To budget and staff project groups (i.e. squads) responsible for either implementing integrations with other DeFi projects or building out community initiatives\n\nThe core team is nominating Pavlo Bendus, Ser Speculor, and Ser Wir to this team. While we did not receive objections to the ability of any of these individuals, community members did raise their concern regarding the precedent being set regarding pseudonymous members. We take these concerns seriously, given our own emphasis on working out in the open ourselves, but recognize that such norms are just that – norms. As the BarnBridge protocol transitions to completely DAO-run in the future, such a norm would only be enforceable through community vote, and so we view the best course of action at the moment to see whether this facet of the proposal is palatable to the community or not.\n\nThe members of the Integrations Team will be compensated every epoch by a smart contract funded by the BarnBridge DAO treasury in $BOND tokens equating to $1500 each. It is expected that Integrations Team members commit an adequate amount of their time to these efforts, and a number of guardrails will be in place to ensure that both the community and the core team can hold them accountable.\n\n-          Regular and transparent reporting of activities and uses of funds\n-          Whistleblower address maintained by the core team\n-          Dedicated Discord channel\n-          Potential for member recall votes\n-          Monitoring of $BOND trading activities\n\nRegarding concerns raised by community members on the nature of this team’s reliance on the core team or its size, we would like to emphasize that we see this as simply the first step in building out a truly decentralized governance system. The templates, processes, and norms that come from the Integrations Team pilot will come to inform a more elaborate structure of specialized working groups and squads that will get built up around the DAO over the coming year. Our primary goal with the Integrations Team is to expand the bandwidth available for the protocol’s horizontal expansion into DeFi and to steward a vibrant community of contributors within the BarnBridge ecosystem.\n\nWith all of that said, this SnapShot will go until the end of Saturday, April 3rd, similar to how our DAO votes go on for four days. Unless there is a meaningful (i.e. > 30%) objection to the terms laid out here, we will move forward with instantiating the Integration Team SquadDAO and proposing a DAO funding vote. That vote will allocate $60,000 worth of BOND to a vesting contract, representing a quarter’s worth of team salary. Future DAO votes will then be used to a) fund the team budget for staffing implementations, and b) renewing salaries on a quarterly basis. \n\nCore team members will abstain from signaling their support for the vote until the end of this period, so as to provide everyone a clear view with community sentiment regarding the proposal.\n",

      "title": "Smart Yield Junior Tranches on Sushiswap Onsen",
      "content": "The Sushiswap Onsen program provides smaller market cap token pairs additional liquidity incentives by setting aside $SUSHI awards over the course of 90-day periods. For a project to be eligible it must have a market capitalization under $100M, among other criteria. While Barnbridge’s $BOND will likely pass this threshold by the time the next 90-day cycle begins, the precedent has been set for applications’ tokens (e.g., Alpha Finance’s ibETHv2, Index Coop’s DPI) to be eligible candidates. This suggests that we could incentivize market making for ERC-20 junior tranche tokens with the launch of Smart Yield in the coming month. \n\nThis proposal suggests the following:\n\n•\tThe Barnbridge DAO will submit applications to the Onsen program for both Compound and Aave Smart Yield USDC Junior Tranches. This would require providing an initial $1000 worth of liquidity for the pairings, as well as 1000 $SUSHI or 2 ETH as a fee. Both of the junior tranche tokens would need to have CoinGecko profiles and have existed for longer than two weeks.\n\n•\tBoth junior tranche tokens would be paired against USDC.\n\n•\tThe Barnbridge DAO would further incentivize these pools by offering 1000 $BOND weekly in liquidity mining rewards for each.\n\n•\tThis could be complemented by additional liquidity mining rewards for the BOND/USDC Sushiswap pairing, which is nonexistent at time of writing.\n\nThe purpose of this proposal is three-fold:\n\n•\tGreater liquidity for junior tranche tokens ultimately leads to greater senior tranche token volume\n\n•\tBrings the Barnbridge ecosystem to a previously neglected, top-tier platform with over $3B in liquidity and which regularly records over $500M in daily volume\n\n•\tSushiswap is a proven competitor; strengthening ties with the platform should prove beneficial to Barnbridge, especially as we look into both building out the Bond Desk concept in the future as well as grow further ties with the yEarn ecosystem\n\nThe two options for this proposal are simple: either “Agree” or “Disagree.” Should the proposal get a meaningful quorum of “Agree”’s, the community can then move forward with hammering out precise liquidity mining allocations and collaborating with the Sushiswap team.\n",
