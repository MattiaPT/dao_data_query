      "title": "GIP-114: Should GnosisDAO support an annual renewal for Blockscout SLA and hosting services - October 2024 - October 2025?",
      "content": "### Executive Summary\nBlockscout continues to be an integral part of the Gnosis ecosystem, providing critical blockchain explorer services for both the Gnosis mainnet and Chiado testnet. The open-source explorer has not only attracted and retained users but has also become an indispensable tool for Gnosis developers. We propose to continue our partnership, offering enhanced services and cutting-edge features to further elevate the Gnosis user experience.\n\n### Demonstrated Value\n\nOver the previous year (since our last update in [GIP 89](https://forum.gnosis.io/t/gip-89-should-gnosisdao-support-an-annual-renewal-for-blockscout-sla-and-hosting-services/7269)), Blockscout has delivered significant value and seen steady usage by the community. The high-level numbers included here come from Mixpanel and directly from the [Gnosis Blockscout instance](https://gnosis.blockscout.com/) covering stats from September 1, 2023 through September 1, 2024 :\n\n Robust User Base:\n  * Monthly active users increased from 11.2K in September 2023 to 28.4K in August 2024. High traffic months included December 2023 with 45,069 MAU and June 2024 with 41,113 MAU.\n  * 115K average monthly page views over the previous year\n\nDeveloper Support: \n* 42K verified contracts (all time)\n\nUser Engagement: \n* ~4.2K signups to myAccount (since Oct 1, 2023)\n\n### Features and Improvements\n\nOver the past year, we've implemented major features through standalone upgrades and significant backend (V6+) and frontend improvements (v1.2+) including:\n\n* User Operations Support - https://gnosis.blockscout.com/ops\n* Human-readable transactions\n* Public tagging and tags submission\n* Name Service support\n* API and CSV export improvements\n* SolidityScan security scores\n* DAppscout improvements including star rating, DeFi menu and tooling, additional sorting features and more.\n\n### Roadmap for the upcoming year\n\n* Advanced filtering and sorting options\n* Account Abstraction improvements\n* NFT explorer enhancements\n* Additional DeFi integrations\n* Statistics and Analytics improvements (additional views, ability to zoom)\n* Multichain search\n* User engagement and retention mechanisms\n\n### Bridged Transactions\n\nIn addition to the roadmap items above, we will create a custom view for xDai bridge transactions providing similar functionality to the current Bridged Deposit Transactions view in Gnosisscan (https://gnosisscan.io/txnbridge). This view provides insights into xDai origination and allows for better tracking and transparency.\n\n### Our Commitment\n\nGnosis is one of the original Blockscout instances and will continue to receive priority updates, services and new features as they are developed. Blockscout will continue to provide superior service for the Gnosis ecosystem.\n\n1. Maintain and host Blockscout instances for Gnosis Chain and Chiado testnet.\n2. Provide premium feature updates.\n3. Offer an SLA that prioritizes maximum uptime, speed, and db optimizations.\n4. Deliver dedicated support via Discord.\n\n### Timeline and Financial Proposition\n\nWe propose a renewal of our 12-month engagement backdated to begin on 1 October 2024 and continuing through 1 October 2025. Over the past year we have optimized our hosting operations and on-premise infrastructure and are pleased to offer a 20% discount on our hosting services for 2024-25.\n\n* Gnosis Chain Mainnet and archive node: $6,400/month (was $8000 per month) for a total 12 month cost of $76,800\n* Chiado Testnet and archive node: $3,200/month (was $4,000/month) for a total 12 month cost of $38,400\n\n**Total Investment:** $115,200\n\n*This represents a $28,800 per year reduction from our 2023 pricing, reflecting our commitment to value and support for the Gnosis ecosystem.*\n\nAmount is requested up front for the year. Payment can be made to Blockscout’s SAFE 0xAddress on Ethereum mainnet (0x242ba6d68FfEb4a098B591B32d370F973FF882B7) with USDC or USDT.\n\n### Ongoing Support & Continued Growth\n\nBlockscout has a proven track record of providing high-quality, reliable and affordable explorer services. We’ve worked hard over the past year to optimize our offerings and close the gap between features provided by closed source explorers and our open-source explorer. We’ve provided resilience and redundancy over the past year during numerous Gnosisscan outages. Above and beyond our parity with other scanners, we are dedicated to developing new and innovative features to support Gnosis as a standalone ecosystem as well as its role in the multichain future.\n\nBy renewing our partnership, you're not just getting a blockchain explorer – you're investing in the continued growth and success of the Gnosis ecosystem. Let's continue building the future of blockchain exploration together!",

      "title": "GIP 112: Should the Gnosis Infrastructure team make changes to the GnosisDAO’s Snapshot configurations?",
      "content": "# Executive Summary\nThe Gnosis Infrastructure team is aiming to improve data availability for the GnosisDAO’s subgraphs being consumed by the Snapshot Space.\n\n- As part of the task there is a need for adopting the right indexing solution which must provide highly available data for the subgraphs running on Gnosis Chain and Ethereum Mainnet which, in turn, are consumed by the Snapshot space.\n- There is a need for improving the current Snapshot strategy called GNO voting power, which needs to reflect all the available options such as GNO deposits made through Safe sponsored calls that allows locked GNO to be used for voting.\n- GIP-101 passed and requires weighted choice voting for the community to elect 10 delegate candidates. However, weighted choice voting is not compatible with the Reality.eth module used to power the GnosisDAO’s Snapshot space. The most viable solution is to open an official Snapshot sub-space with weighted choice voting enabled. In addition to updating the Snapshot subgraphs detailed above, the Gnosis Infrastructure team will open a Snapshot sub-space to enable weighted choice voting should this proposal pass quorum.\n\n# Introduction\nThe GnosisDAO's Snapshot space needs to be monitored and maintained by the Gnosis Infrastructure team. Issues that can arise are most often related to The Graph's subgraph indexer for Snapshot. The Snapshot Subgraph is a powerful tool that efficiently organizes and indexes on-chain governance events sourced from the Snapshot DAO client.\n\nThe recent issues with the latest GIPs were related to the subgraphs indexer, which had stopped working. The subgraphs are hosted by The Graph and will be deprecated To if they are not updated.\n\nCommunity members also surfaced issues related to voting with their staked GNO further indicating that there was a subgraph issue.\n\nhttps://forum.gnosis.io/t/bug-in-the-snapshot-voting-power-calculation/8395\n\nGnosis DevOps initiated a review of all Snapshot configurations and found that **the GnosisDAO's multisig owners would need to sign off on updating the settings for the DAO's Snapshot.**\n\n# Proposed Changes\nThe subgraphs for GNO voting power, which are currently running as best effort on Ethereum and Gnosis Chain, will necessarily need to be re-deployed on The Graph Decentralized network. As a result of the re-deploy process a new value for the SUBGRAPH_URL in the Snapshot space configuration will be generated.\n\nThis value must be filled in the Snapshot configuration. Any modifications to the GnosisDAO’s Snapshot settings must be voted on by the DAO and executed via the DAO’s multi-sig.\n\n# Impact and Benefits\nUpdating the Snapshot configurations to install a new Graph API URL will improve data availability for the GnosisDAO’s subgraphs being consumed by the Snapshot Space. The Infrastructure team will also improve the current Snapshot strategy called GNO voting power so that locked GNO from GIP-28 can participate in GnosisDAO governance. \n\nhttps://forum.gnosis.io/t/gip-28-allow-gno-holders-to-vote-even-if-their-gno-are-invested-staked-locked-in-smart-contracts-in-different-protocols-networks/2357\n\n# Implementation Plan\nPlease provide a detailed plan for implementing the proposed changes, including timelines, key milestones, and any necessary resources or support.\n\nThe Gnosis Infrastructure team will be working on fixing the most impacting issues with the subgraph, among which we have:\n\n1. Migration to the Decentralized Network\nObjective: Transition the existing subgraph from the hosted service to the Decentralized Network ahead of the service's deprecation to ensure continued functionality and support by migrating to a more sustainable and decentralized service. **This is a high priority and time sensitive task that needs to be carried out asap due to TheGraph hosted service being deprecated definitely by September 14th 2024.**\n\n2. Refresh of Voting Power Strategy\nObjective: Revise the voting power calculation to align with current blockchain usage and protocol engagement. Accurately reflect the active protocols and eliminate outdated or less utilized ones, enhancing the relevance and fairness of voting power metrics. \n\nAdditionally, voting power must account for:\n- Beacon chain withdrawals\n- Have the withdrawal address accruing the voting power as opposed to the deposit address\n- osGNO\n- osGNO-GNO Balancer/Aura pool\n\nThe Infrastructure team will remove support for:\n\n- 1Hive (Gnosis)\n- Swapper (Gnosis)\n- SushiSwap (Gnosis)\n- Elk (Gnosis)\n- Baoswap (Gnosis)\n- Symmetric (Gnosis)\n- Uni v3 (mainnet)\n- Balancer (mainnet)\n\n3. Fixes and Enhancements in Voting Power Calculation\nObjective: Correct and refine the calculation issues leading to inaccurate voting scores on some indexed protocols in order to keep fairness of the voting process. Please see previous DAO votes covering the topic of allowing locked GNO to vote on Snapshot for more info.\n\n- Withdrawal event of the Gnosis Beacon Chain Deposit smart contract was not handled correctly resulting in a wrong tracking of deposited GNO over the network. This issue is considered as critical as it could lead to vote power farming. Currently it’s not trivial to detect if a withdrawal is for claiming reward or for exit validator without tracking the Execution Layer (that is not possible in the subgraph). We decided to consider all withdrawals as an exit, even though this means we're not accounting for rewards generated over time. While this isn't ideal, it's the best solution we have at the moment to prevent abuse.\n\nOur technical team is actively working on a better and more accurate solution, and we plan to update the system in the coming weeks.\n\n- Fixing the issue with the Deposit event of the Gnosis Beacon Chain Deposit smart contract incorrectly handled, which was causing some issues with how voting power was being assigned. Specifically, the problem affected services like Gelato Network, where the voting power was incorrectly being assigned to the service itself rather than to the user.\n\nForum threads:\n- https://forum.gnosis.io/t/should-gnosisdao-allow-to-use-gno-locked-in-balancer-pools-for-voting-in-snapshot-proposals/902\n- https://forum.gnosis.io/t/gip-28-allow-gno-holders-to-vote-even-if-their-gno-are-invested-staked-locked-in-smart-contracts-in-different-protocols-networks/2357\n- https://forum.gnosis.io/t/bug-in-the-snapshot-voting-power-calculation/8395\n\nAll the changes will be handled publicly on the following repository: https://github.com/gnosis/subgraph-voting-power\n\nThe subgraphs will be owned by a Safe on Arbitrum (arb1:0x67cE12b820ea02f045e2507648608442C6527c6C) having the Infrastructure team as owners. Subgraphs will be publicly available on this page: https://thegraph.com/explorer/profile/0x67cE12b820ea02f045e2507648608442C6527c6C?view=Subgraphs&chain=arbitrum-one\n\nAny updates regarding this GIP will be handled in a dedicated post in the Governance section of the Gnosis Forum.",

      "title": "[Redo] GIP-110: Should the Gnosis DAO create and fund a Gnosis Pay rewards program with 10k GNO?",
      "content": "# Summary\nThis proposal aims to create a cashback program for Gnosis Pay, benefiting GNO holders. The program will feature five tiers of cashback rewards, ranging from 1% to 4% based on the amount of GNO deposited in Gnosis Pay. An extra 1% (1pp) will be awarded to Gnosis Pay OG NFT holders. Rewards will be airdropped weekly to users ~7 days after their transactions, calculated based on the minimum GNO balance held during the week the payment was made. The rewards, measured in the currency of the payment, will be distributed in GNO using the Gnosis Chain GNO/USD, EUR/USD or GBP/USD Chainlink (or Chronicle for GBP) price feed at the time of distribution of the reward. A maximum of EUR 20,000, USD 22,000, or GBP 18,000 will be eligible to accrue rewards per month for every user.\n\n# Rationale\nAfter last year's outstanding growth, Gnosis Chain has stagnated, mainly due to the substantial incentives offered by alternative L1s and L2s. However, many of the users and capital in these other chains are likely to leave once the incentives end. Gnosis aims to create sticky users through a suite of products, with Gnosis Pay being the first. After months of improvements, Gnosis Pay is now ready for mass adoption. This cashback program is strategically designed to bootstrap user engagement without significant costs to the DAO. Users participating in the program must have GNO in their Gnosis Pay Safe wallet, incurring an opportunity cost by not staking their GNO. Thus, since GNO held in a Safe wallet will not be staked, the additional cost to the DAO would be minimal compared to the benefits.\n\n# Implementation\nUsers who hold GNO in the Gnosis Pay Safe will be eligible for cashback rewards on eligible Gnosis Pay Card transactions according to the following tiers:\n\n≥0.1 GNO: 1%\n≥1 GNO: 2%\n≥10 GNO: 3%\n≥100 GNO: 4%\nThe cashback percentage scales continuously within each tier (e.g., holding 5.5 GNO earns 2.5% cashback). Beyond 100 GNO, the cashback percentage does not increase any further. Additionally, Gnosis Pay OG NFT holders who qualify for the airdrop (with at least 0.1 GNO deposited) will receive an extra 1% cashback. For instance, a user holding 5.5 GNO and the OG NFT would receive 3.5% cashback. This feature will add value to future NFT campaigns by Gnosis Pay (e.g., referral programs).\n\nA maximum of EUR 20,000, USD 22,000, or GBP 18,000 will be eligible to accrue rewards per month for every user.\n\nThe program will be administered and managed by Karpatkey, responsible for tracking, determining, and distributing the rewards, as well as reporting the results. The reward calculation code will be open source. We will also provide an endpoint for those that want to feature the rewards in their UIs.\n\nRewards will be distributed weekly, 5-12 days after the user made the payment, based on the lowest amount of GNO tokens held in their Gnosis Pay Safe during the week the payment was made. It is this amount of GNO held prior to the card payment that will be relevant in calculating the cashback. For example, having 1 GNO in the Gnosis Pay Safe and making a payment in the same week would yield 2% cashback. However, topping up GNO to the Gnosis Pay Safe after a payment does not change the cashback applicable to that payment. Eligible “payments” do not include ATM withdrawals, which will not count towards card payments for the purposes of this program. By participating in the program (transferring GNO to the Gnosis Pay Safe), users agree that Gnosis Pay will share transaction details related to ATM withdrawals with karpatkey. Transactions similar to this one on essence (for example, topping up bank accounts with the card) will also not be eligible, and this information will also be shared. However, personal information will not be shared. The program will run until the budget runs off, or until the DAO votes to terminate it or replace it. Cashback received from payments there were refunded will tracked and until the users has a \"positive balance\" of accrued rewards, no further payments will be made.\n\nShall this proposal passes, a trial period will commence on August 19th, which will run for a week and will not accrue any rewards. Then, the actual program will commence on August 26th.\n\nThe GNO Cashback Program is sponsored by GnosisDAO, offered and administered by the Gnosis DAO Operational Foundation, and operated by karpatkey in accordance with its mandate from the Sponsor.",

Users participating in the program must have GNO in their Gnosis Pay Safe wallet, incurring an opportunity cost by not staking their GNO. Thus, since GNO held in a Safe wallet will not be staked, the additional cost to the DAO would be minimal compared to the benefits.\n\n\n## Implementation\n\nUsers who hold GNO in the Gnosis Pay Safe will be eligible for cashback rewards on eligible Gnosis Pay Card transactions according to the following tiers:\n\n* ≥0.1 GNO: 1%\n* ≥1 GNO: 2%\n* ≥10 GNO: 3%\n* ≥100 GNO: 4%\n\nThe cashback percentage scales continuously within each tier (e.g., holding 5.5 GNO earns 2.5% cashback). Beyond 100 GNO, the cashback percentage does not increase any further. Additionally, Gnosis Pay OG NFT holders who qualify for the airdrop (with at least 0.1 GNO deposited) will receive an extra 1% cashback. For instance, a user holding 5.5 GNO and the OG NFT would receive 3.5% cashback. This feature will add value to future NFT campaigns by Gnosis Pay (e.g., referral programs).\n\nA maximum of EUR 20,000, USD 22,000, or GBP 18,000 will be eligible to accrue rewards per month for every user. \n\nThe program will be administered and managed by Karpatkey, responsible for tracking, determining, and distributing the rewards, as well as reporting the results. The reward calculation code will be open source. We will also provide an endpoint for those that want to feature the rewards in their UIs. \n\nRewards will be distributed weekly, 5-12 days after the user made the payment, based on the lowest amount of GNO tokens held in their Gnosis Pay Safe during the week the payment was made. It is this amount of GNO held prior to the card payment that will be relevant in calculating the cashback. For example, having 1 GNO in the Gnosis Pay Safe and making a payment in the same week would yield 2% cashback. However, topping up GNO to the Gnosis Pay Safe after a payment does not change the cashback applicable to that payment. Eligible “payments” do not include ATM withdrawals, which will not count towards card payments for the purposes of this program. By participating in the program (transferring GNO to the Gnosis Pay Safe), users agree that Gnosis Pay will share transaction details related to ATM withdrawals with karpatkey. Transactions similar to this one on essence (for example, topping up bank accounts with the card) will also not be eligible, and this information will also be shared. However, personal information will not be shared. The program will run until the budget runs off, or until the DAO votes to terminate it or replace it. Cashback received from payments there were refunded will tracked and until the users has a \"positive balance\" of accrued rewards, no further payments will be made.\n\nShall this proposal passes, a trial period will commence on August 19th, which will run for a week and will not accrue any rewards. Then, the actual program will commence on August 26th.\n\nThe GNO Cashback Program is sponsored by GnosisDAO, offered and administered by the Gnosis DAO Operational Foundation, and operated by karpatkey in accordance with its mandate from the Sponsor.",

      "title": "GIP-111: Should the GnosisDAO fund the Ethereum Protocol Attackathon?",
      "content": "Summary:\n\nEthereum needs more security researchers to examine the codebase and help find vulnerabilities. As the ecosystem has grown, this is an excellent opportunity to co-fund an audit challenge with the Ethereum community.\n\nThe Ethereum Foundation (EF) invites sponsors to support the reward pool for the eight-week Ethereum Attackathon.\n\nThis event aims to enhance the security of the Ethereum protocol by organizing the largest crowdsourced security audit competition. The goal is to raise over $2 million, with $500,000 committed from the Ethereum Foundation.\n\nThe Attackathon will be hosted on Immunefi, which they do at no cost, meaning all contributions go directly to securing the protocol.\n\nThis challenge is especially relevant for Gnosis. Gnosis has a similar architecture, is the only EVM with a beacon chain and uses the same clients.\n\nA security bug bounty on the Ethereum core protocol benefits the Gnosis Chain by identifying shared vulnerabilities, enhancing overall security, and fostering a stronger developer community. This collaborative approach ensures cost-effective, high-quality security improvements and maintains trust and interoperability between the chains.\n\nDuration: Eight weeks\n\nFunding: 100,000 usd\n\nSpecification\n\nWhat is an Attackathon?\nAn Attackathon is a comprehensive event involving three phases:\n\nBefore the Attackathon: A comprehensive education program on the protocol’s code delivered via live technical walkthroughs and Attackathon Academy content.\n\nDuring the Attackathon, Security researchers hunt the code based on specific rules to qualify for rewards. Only reports that are impactful as specified by the rules of the Attackathon, will be rewarded.\n\nAfter the Attackathon: Immunefi evaluates and compiles the results in the form of an official Attackathon report and spotlights top researchers with NFT awards and a leaderboard.\n\nThe Attackathon aims to be the largest-ever crowdsourced security audit contest conducted to augment security for the entirety of the protocol’s code.\n\nRationale\n\nThe Ethereum Foundation has a permanent bug bounty, although it does not get the awareness and eyeballs it should get on the code.\n\nRunning the largest audit contest now will help increase the security of the Ethereum protocol and upskill security researchers for contests at every hard fork in the future.\n\nShared Codebase and Vulnerabilities: Vulnerabilities in Ethereum could apply to the Gnosis Chain due to their shared codebase.\nSecurity Enhancements: Ethereum’s security improvements directly enhance the Gnosis Chain’s security boosting trust for Ethereum and Gnosis.\nEcosystem: A secure Ethereum fosters a confident developer community, benefiting the Gnosis Chain\nCost-Effective Security: Aligning with Ethereum’s security efforts provides high-quality assessments without bearing the total cost.\nBudget\n\nWe seek to raise at least $2 million, with the EF contributing $500k. So far, a few projects have signed up to secure Ethereum.\n\nBased on feedback, we created a couple of tiers, although a project can be sponsored with any amount they wish.\n\nUnicorn Partners (+75 ETH Commitment (Approx. $250,000) (limited to two projects)\n\n1x Unique NFT with leaderboard rank\nParticipation in Attackathon Kick-off Twitter Space as a partner speaker\nLeaderboard Placement on Sponsor page\nTop-tier logo placement on Sponsor and Program Landing Page\nTop-tier logo placement on the Program Education page and program report\nCall out in Press Releases and EF and Immunefi Program Announcement Blogs\nDigital Logo Placement in the results announcement at Devon or a dedicated virtual event\n4x Devcon tickets\n25% Discount on Crowd Sec offerings [transferable]\n1x Dedicated Twitter post announcing sponsorship from Immunefi Twitter handle\nPanda Partners +30 ETH Commitment (Approx. $100,000)\n\n1x Unique NFT with leaderboard rank\nLeaderboard listing on the sponsor landing page\nMid-roll logo placement on Sponsor and Program Landing Page\n2x Devcon tickets\n10% Discount on Immunefi Crowd Sec offerings [Transferable]\n1x Dedicated Twitter post announcing sponsorship from Immunefi Twitter handle\nKey dates include:\n\nJuly 8-11: EthCC program announcement\n\nAugust 8: Detailed program announcement and education kickoff.\n3rd Week of August: Attackathon hunting begins.\nMid-October: Attackathon concludes, and results compilation begins.\nNovember 9-17: Results announced at Devcon.\n\nEvaluation\n\nThe reports will be triaged by the Immunefi team and judged by EF and client team security researchers.\n\nAny unused funds will roll over to future audit contests and security research.\n\nI look forward to hearing from the Gnosis community on helping secure the Ethereum protocol.",

It introduces several new features, including real-time monitoring of up to 100,000 validators, the ability to group validators, and options to share custom dashboards.\n\nOur next steps are to rework the notification system, introduce an account dashboard for transactions, new APIs, new mobile App and more.\n\nDue to these upcoming changes, we stopped contributing to the v1 explorer codebase a few months ago. We expect to fully migrate to the v2 explorer sometime next year. Because of this, we would love to have Gnosischain on our v2 [open source](https://github.com/gobitfly/beaconchain) explorer.\n\nVoting in favor of this proposal will ensure a smooth transition from v1 to v2 for gnosischain.\n\n## Specification\n\nOne major criticism from the Gnosis community was the cap of 280 validators in the dashboard and app. This limit was due to technical constraints, not our unwillingness to increase it. Additionally, our old pricing did not differentiate between networks.\n\nWe have listened to your feedback and propose the following for the v2 explorer:\n\n- Free users can monitor up to 20 validators, [which matches the average number for most Gnosis users](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1IEPVvOE3T6B-a3NJVt3ws4LXXqc_h-QG-lw8wVoLgH8/edit#slide=id.g27a35603b14_0_1314)\n\n- Subscribed users can monitor up to 100,000 validators.\n\n- All features mentioned here: https://v2-beta-holesky.beaconcha.in/pricing will also be available for Gnosis.\n\n- Premium plans will offer a significantly higher validator limit for Gnosis compared to Ethereum, integrated within the existing pricing tiers.\nFor example, if Pricing Tier “[Guppy](https://v2-beta-holesky.beaconcha.in/pricing)” supports 100 Ethereum validators, it will support a higher number of Gnosis validators, may support up to 500.\nThis means users will only need one subscription to increase their limits on Ethereum and gnosis.\n\nThe exact number for the Gnosis validator limit will be determined when we start integrating Gnosis.\n![|170x508](https://forum.gnosis.io/uploads/default/optimized/2X/9/9a84595530f108da0687aa5c1e95f1e9f7a31291_2_250x750.png)\n\n## Budget\n\n$300,000 annually\n60% in USD/USDC - $180k USDC/USDT\n40% in GNO - $120k in GNO (2 Year lockup)\n+one-time v2 integration fee $100,000\n100% in USDC/USDT\n\nOur address `0x9d4E94dB689Bc471E45b0a18B7BdA36FcCeC9c3b` (beaconchain.eth)\n\n## Timeline, Implementations and Deliverable\n\nSince [gnosischa.in ](http://gnosischa.in)is already up and running, there are no milestones necessary for v1. (See [GIP-74](https://forum.gnosis.io/t/gip-74-should-gnosisdao-support-gnosischa-in-explorer-hosted-by-beaconcha-in/6228?u=butta))\n\nVoting in favor of this proposal will ensure a smooth transition from v1 to v2 for gnosischain and will cover the costs of v1-gnosischa.in for 1 year.",

Our goal is to amplify awareness of Shutterized Gnosis Chain and its benefits to end users - protection against malicious MEV and censorship. Our intended impact is to achieve widespread adoption - increase users and transactions on Shutterized Gnosis Chain. The two primary foci of these marketing activities will be 1) to hire and direct Wachsman, a PR agency to promote the launch and all activities around it and 2) to put a heavy focus on IRL events such as ETHCC, hackathons and various meetups.\n\nThe activities under this grant will run through Q3 and Q4 2024.\n\n## Specification\n\n**Opportunity:**\n\nGnosis Chain, Nethermind and brainbot recently announced the [launch of Shutterized Chiado testnet](https://blog.shutter.network/the-first-shutterized-testnet-is-now-live-on-chiado/). We are now working together to launch Shutterized Gnosis Chain in early July 2024.\n\nShutterized Gnosis Chain will be a significant milestone for a Gnosis Chain and its users. Gnosis Chain will become the first blockchain to implement threshold encrypted mempools, which protect end users against malicious MEV and censorship using decentralized technology.\n\n**Initiative:**\n\nbrainbot is spearheading a comprehensive marketing campaign to ensure a successful launch of Shutterized Gnosis Chain. The campaign aims to:\n\n- further promote Gnosis Chain as the leading blockchain implementing crypto’s core values: decentralization, permissionlessness, accessibility, information symmetry etc.\n\n- highlight Gnosis Chain’s growing DeFi ecosystem\n\n- raise awareness that Gnosis Chain is now the “safe blockchain”, where degens can trade without fear of malicious MEV (such as front running and sandwich attacks)\n- raise awareness that Gnosis Chain is also the “censorship resistant blockchain”, where users can be assured that their transactions are a) included, b) treated equally and fairly regardless of their content\n\n- increase the satisfaction / NPS of defi traders on Gnosis Chain\n\n- increase the percentage of protected transactions on Gnosis Chain\n\n- growth in social media engagement and followers (Gnosis Chain and Shutter accounts)\n\n- achieve media coverage for the launch of Shutterized Gnosis Chain\n\nStretch goals:\n\n- increase the total number of users and total value locked (TVL) on Gnosis Chain\n\n- increase the total number of monthly transactions on Gnosis Chain\n\n## Budget\n\n### Total Requested Funding: 40,000 xDAI + 100 GNO\n\nThe reason to request the GNO portion of the grant is to increase long term alignment between the projects.\n\n### Budget Breakdown (estimated):\n\n\n\n| **Head of Marketing** | Plan and orchestrate the campaign | $12k |\n| **2 x Protocol Developers (part time)** | Assist dApp builders and hackathon teams | $16.5k |\n| **Social Media Manager** | Social media engagement | $8k |\n\n| **Designer** | Create brand & design assets related to Shutter x Gnosis | $6k |\n| *PR Agency** | Wachsman agency for Public relations, media coordination, policy liaison | $11.5k |\n| **KOL Agency** | KOL activation, social media engagement | $6k |\n\n| **Events** | Community and core developer engagement | $10k |\n| **Survey** | Incentivise responses for survey regarding satisfaction / NPS | $3.5k |\n\n## Marketing Activities\n\n### Shutterized Gnosis Chain Events and Proposals (subject to change)\n\n**“Defenders of the Crypto Realm” Movement:**\n\nLaunching a movement to address systematic manipulation across blockchains. Collaboration and input from Gnosis is sought.\n\n**Gnosis Berlin Meetup (Thu, June 20):**\n\n- Presentation about Shutterized Gnosis Chain\n\n**Press Release (approx 4 weeks before launch of Shutterized Gnosis Chain):**\n\n- Joint press release\n\n- Organize media engagements (interviews, op-eds, etc.)\n\n- Seek media relationships for engagement\n\n**ETHCC Activations:**\n\n- Conference Bingo\n\n- “Sandwich Attack!” - a Popup Piñata Party\n- Rock Paper Scissors Challenge\n\n**ETHCC Breakfast Side Event (Wed, July 10th):**\n\n- Co-curated agenda\n\n- Co-branded event\n\n**Hackathons (confirmed)**\n\n- ETHGlobal Singapore (Sept 20-22)\n\n- ETHSan Francisco (Oct 18-20)\n\n- ETHBangkok (Nov 15-17)\n\n**Hackathons (prospective)**\n- EthWarsaw (Sept 5-8)\n\n- EthRome (Oct 4-6)\n\n**Other Events (prospective)**\n- Web3Privacy Summit Rome (Oct 4)\n\n**Bounty Ideas:**\n\n- Wallet with integrated Shutter encryption functionality (e.g., fork MetaMask)\n\n- Web application to encrypt raw transactions\n\n- Self-deployable RPC proxy server for transaction encryption\n\n- Analytics on Shutter transaction schedules, queue status, costs, etc.\n\n- Projects requiring privacy/non-frontrunnability\n\n## Existing Grant\n\nShutter DAO 0x36 has already provided brainbot with a grant for 180,000 USDC and 60,000 SHU to support this marketing campaign. Additional funding from Gnosis DAO will significantly enhance the reach and impact of this campaign.\n\n## Team/Organization\n\n**brainbot gmbh:** We are a core developer of Shutter and a contributor to Shutter DAO 0x36. We are seasoned team with extensive experience in blockchain marketing, supported by external consultants and agencies.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe proposed grant will enable brainbot to execute a robust marketing campaign surrounding the launch of the Shutterized Gnosis Chain in Q3 and Q4 2024. The marketing campaign will focus on hiring and directing a PR agency to promote the launch and all activities around it , and hosting/supporting IRL events including ETHCC, hackathons and meetups. The marketing campaign will increase awareness of the benefits to end users (e.g. protection against malicious MEV and censorship) and achieve widespread adoption (e.g. increase users and transactions on Shutterized Gnosis Chain). The proposed grant will benefit Gnosis Chain and the Gnosis ecosystem.\n\n---\n\n**Voting Options:**\n\n- **In favour:** Approve the grant to brainbot gmbh\n\n- **Against:** Do not approve the grant\n\n\n**License:** CC0 1.0",

      "content": "GIP: 102\ntitle: Should GnosisDAO provide financing for the new GnosisVC ecosystem venture fund?\nauthor: Ben, GnosisVC\ntype: Funding\nstatus: Draft\ncreated: 2024-06-10\nduration: 7y\nfunding: $20 million\n\nSummary\n\nGnosisDAO should finance the new GnosisVC fund to promote further ecosystem growth and product lines in the selected target verticals.\nAbstract\n\nGnosisVC fund will raise a total of $40m, wherein GnosisDAO will invest $20m and the remaining $20m will be raised from external LPs.\nGnosisVC will invest in early-stage projects to accelerate the development, adoption, and growth of DApps and fintech integrations strengthening the broader Gnosis Ecosystem.\n\nGnosisVC fund will deploy into early-stage projects in line with the existing Gnosis 3.0 thesis with a focus on RWAs, Decentralized Infrastructure, and Financial Payment Rails as target verticals.\nFund Structure & Terms\n\nThe fund will be set up as a Cayman-exempt limited partnership with a term of 7 years (+ up to 2 years extension) and a 2/20 fee structure (2% management fees and 20% carry per industry standards).\n\nThe investment period will last for 3 years, with the expected schedule of the capital calls being ca. one-third of the total commitment to be paid in per year.\n\nDeliverables to LPs will include:\nQuarterly reports on the investment portfolio posted on DAO forum.\nInvestment summaries are shared with LPs via a dedicated data room.\nImplementation Initiatives\n\nVenture Fund:\nSupport and incubate projects through funding, governance participation, and advisory.\n\nGnosis Ecosystem Integration:\nOnboarding and integrating portfolio companies into the larger Gnosis ecosystem through an introduction to existing Gnosis projects and by facilitating a collaborative environment.\n\nMaintenance:\nContinued review and collaboration with existing partners and ongoing assistance for portfolio companies from GIP 38.\n\nReporting:\nQuarterly reports and updates on investments and portfolio companies will be shared with the DAO, as well as their contribution to the evolution of the Gnosis 3.0 thesis.\nInvestment Thesis\n\nGnosisVC will be deploying capital into projects that will strengthen the existing Gnosis ecosystem through but not limited to the following three investment verticals:\nFinancial Payments\n\nIncremental margins are the core of the payment stack. The vertical is very crowded with a deeply intermediated stack and heavy cross selling. Focussing on payments middleware around Gnosis Pay, the fund should have considerable experience and informational advantages to be able to build out an integrated stack from the point of sale onwards.\nDecentralized Infrastructure\n\nThe future of computing and data availability is open source. In the absence of a fully mature Zero-Knowledge cryptography stack, the decentralization of services and applications at scale must proceed hand-in-hand with an equivalent decentralization of the underlying component infrastructure. The development of such an internet-native substrate must be tackled from multiple avenues: data availability, composable compute environments, orchestration and coordination of tasks, tooling, and real-time analytics to name a few. As a case study, LLMs have captured the public imagination on a circa 6-year-old technology. While there has been a lot of focus on model quality, model tooling, hosting, and standalone end-user deployments are an equally important but frequently underestimated part of the vertical. Historically, some of the most impressive investments by Gnosis have been infrastructure-related (MatterLabs, Gelato, TheGraph). As such, we believe that this vertical stays true to the Gnosis DNA.\nRWA\n\nThe Defi crypto markets are saturated with liquidity and narrative-driven demand without sufficient credit products to deploy into. This is due to the current need for full collateralization, so capital is abundant while investment opportunities are still scarce, there is also huge latent demand for institutional adoption through stablecoins, yield-bearing instruments, and new liquid RWAs. The continued growth of self-custodial alternatives to existing CeFi interfaces presents the opportunity to funnel conventional financial players into the already existing Defi stack.\n\nTeam\n\nInvestment Committee\n\nBenjamin Senn,\nDAO Legal Consultant\n\nDaniele Pinna,\nQuantitative DeFi Researcher 0xSideQuest\n\nColin Rix,\nMulti-Strategy Fund Portfolio Manager\n\nAriunaa Batzorig,\nDAO treasury & Portfolio/Asset Manager\n\nStefan George,\nCTO Gnosis (excluded from management fees and carry)\n\nAdvisors\n\nSebastian Bürgel,\nVP Technology Gnosis & Founder HOPR\n\nArthur Gervais,\nAssoc.

      "title": "GIP-101: Should karpatkey and StableLab Establish a Delegate Program v0 for the GnosisDAO?",
      "content": "## Executive Summary\nThis proposal aims to prevent the GnosisDAO from encountering challenges related to reaching a quorum on its proposals, preventing the hindrance of effective decision-making and governance processes. This program is designed to improve quorum participation, increase community engagement and strengthen the governance processes of the GnosisDAO, leading to more effective and inclusive decision-making.\n\nThis proposal suggests electing ten delegates through a transparent and democratic election process to increase the DAO's ability to reach a quorum and enhance the community's participation in decision-making. \n\nEach selected delegate will receive 5,000 GNO from the DAO Treasury, empowering them to represent the community's interests and contribute actively to the governance of the GnosisDAO. This delegation will last six months. This proposal distributes temporary voting power only.\n\n\n## Specification\nThis program will delegate 5,000 GNO from the GnosisDAO treasury to 10 candidates selected through a Snapshot voting process.\n\n### Eligibility Criteria\nEach applicant must meet the following criteria to be eligible to become a delegate in this program:\n- **Active Community Membership.** Nominees must be active members of the GnosisDAO Community. To meet this criteria, they will share a link to their forum account or Discord, demonstrating activity for at least six months.\n    - If they do not meet this criteria, an active member not already participating in this program may sponsor them. Active members may only sponsor one applicant.\n- **History of Governance Experience.** Nominees must have governance experience as demonstrated by a history of participation in the GnosisDAO governance process or another active DAO. To meet these criteria, they will share a link to their relevant Snapshot or Tally profile showing a history of governance involvement.\n- **Post a Delegate Initiative.** Nominees will post a delegate initiative on the GnosisDAO forum that outlines the details of their experience in DAO Governance and their approach to contributing to GnosisDAO Governance. \n\nThese criteria are designed to ensure that the selected delegates are experienced and committed members of the GnosisDAO community, capable of effectively representing the community's interests and contributing to the DAO's governance.\n\n### Delegate Selection Process\n#### Submission\nDelegates will nominate themselves by posting interest in the official *\"Nomination Thread\"*. The nomination thread will be posted upon passing this proposal. Please provide the instructions, date, and template for application submission.\n\nIn addition to meeting the Eligibility Criteria, delegates will be expected to explain (at a minimum) the following in their application:\n- **Introduction:** Introduce themselves or the organization. The goal is one brief paragraph.\n- **Proposed Delegate Initiative:** State their reason for wanting to be a GnosisDAO delegate or become further involved in the GnosisDAO. \n- **Areas of expertise:** Explain any expertise relevant to their involvement in the GnosisDAO.\n\n\n#### Voting and Selection\nAll *qualified and complete* submissions received during the submission phase will be placed on a ballot. The ballot will be moved to Snapshot, and voting will be conducted using the [weighted voting](https://docs.snapshot.org/user-guides/proposals/voting-types#weighted-voting) strategy. \n\nVoters are encouraged to select nominations that promote diversity and representation based on their expertise, commitment to the DAO's principles and dedication to advancing the GnosisDAO's mission. \n\nThe **top ten** nominations receiving the most votes will be selected to receive a 5,000 GNO delegation for this six-month trial program.\n\n### Timeline\nA nomination thread will be opened on the forum, and applications will be accepted for three weeks. At the end of three weeks, eligible applications will be assembled and move to a [weighted Snapshot vote](https://docs.snapshot.org/user-guides/proposals/voting-types#weighted-voting) to determine the selected delegates. \n\n| Phase       | Duration |\n| ----------- | -------- |\n| Phase 1: Application | 3 weeks  |\n| Phase 2: Voting      | 1 week   |\n| Phase 3: Active Delegation Program     | 6 Months   |\n\nAlthough the duration timeline is specified in this proposal, the official dates will be established once this proposal is passed and posted in the Nomination Thread with instructions for applying.\n### Program Duration\nThis delegate trial program will run for six months, after which the community will review it for renewal or deprecation.\n\n### Delegation Allocation\nEach of the ten delegates selected will receive 5k GNO independently. The distribution is designed to provide equal incentives for participation.\n\nThe total amount being allocated (50k GNO) was chosen because it represents a significant amount of quorum while not meaningfully diluting current stakeholders while still providing a boosting governance involvement.\n\nkarpatkey will assist the GnosisDAO in creating ten separate SAFEs, configuring them to the same policy as employed in the treasury management SAFEs. This set-up will ensure the DAO retains custody of the GNO and the signer for the delegation actions.\n\n\n### Accountability Mechanisms\nTo ensure accountability for this program and the delegates receiving active delegations, two sets of performance indicators will be established:\n\n#### 1. Delegate KPI's\nDelegates will be required to maintain minimum standards of participation. These standards are:\n- Maintaining a voting record of at least 70%.\n- Maintaining a voting reasoning communication record of 100%.\n\n#### 2. Program KPI's\nThis KPI ensures that program facilitators remain actively involved and promote the success of delegates:\n- Greater than 50% of the nominated and selected delegates meet their Delegate KPIs.\n\n**Note:** If a delegate is below these indicators at the conclusion of the trial period, this delegate will be ineligible to participate in the next Delegate Program cycle. Elected delegates are entering this program with the expectation of voting on all proposals and promptly communicating their rationale for voting on the forum.\n\n\n## Rationale\nAchieving a quorum on proposals is not just a procedural requirement but a crucial factor for the smooth functioning and effectiveness of the GnosisDAO. Quorum ensures that decisions reflect the community's consensus and that proposals receive adequate scrutiny and deliberation before implementation. However, the DAO needs help to reach quorum levels, leading to delays in decision-making and potentially impacting the progress of important initiatives vital for the DAO's growth and success.\n\nBy selecting up to 10 delegates through an election process, we aim to bolster quorum participation and increase community engagement in governance activities. Delegates entrusted with representing the community's interests will actively participate in discussions, vote on proposals, and advocate for initiatives that align with the DAO's objectives. Their involvement will enhance the diversity of perspectives considered in decision-making and foster a more inclusive governance process. \n\n\n## Budget\n**The total budget for this six-month trial period is $20,000, paid in xDAI.** The budget will pay StableLab to function as the \"Program Facilitator\". This budget pays for the work involved in assisting with this program design and providing oversight of delegates, including ensuring delegates remain active in meeting their participation KPIs. \n\nStablelabs will also provide a retrospective analysis of this program's efficacy to aid the DAO's decision to continue beyond an initial six-month trial period.\n\n#### Payment Schedule\n\n| Payment      | Amount                     |\n| ------------ | -------------------------- |\n| Month 1 | One payment of 10,000 xDAI  |\n| Month 3 | One payment of 10,000 xDAI |\n| **Total**    | **20,000 xDAI**            |\n\nThese two payments will be made during the months of the active delegation phase following a successful selection of delegates.\n\n## Evaluation\nThis program will be evaluated by successfully completing the KPIs established in this proposal. A DAO vote will be required to continue it beyond the initial six-month trial period.\n\n## Team/ Organization\nkarpatkey and StableLab are jointly presenting this proposal. StableLab will serve the role of \"Program Facilitator\", providing oversight and upkeep, while karpatkey will provide support in setting up the SAFEs.\n\n- **karpatkey** will support the technical implementation of the Gnosis Delegate Program by initiating the required SAFEs to achieve multiple delegations. karpatkey will also assist in receiving the payment requests from StableLab. As an already established and compensated service provider, karpatkey will provide these services under existing agreements.\n\n- **StableLab** (*\"Program Facilitator\"*) will facilitate the governance frameworks and non-technical operations required to execute the Gnosis Delegate Program so that all elected delegates maintain their KPIs. This measure ensures that the Delegate Program operates effectively and in the community's best interests. StableLab has experience establishing, running, and actively participating in delegate programs across DAOs such as Aave, Uniswap, 1inch, Balancer, Safe, etc.\n\n### Points of Contact\n- karpatkey: @coltron.eth & @netrim\n- StableLab: @Kene_StableLab",

      "content": "We suggest allocating approximately 5% of the Gnosis DAO assets, primarily SAFE, ETH, and stablecoins, to fund a $30 million buyback program. This proposal is aimed at bringing the price of GNO above the book value.\n\n\n**Goals**\n* Transfer value to long-term holders by acquiring GNO below its intrinsic value. The acquired tokens can be utilized for the growth and other initiatives of the DAO.\n* Signal to the market a commitment to establishing a valuation floor for GNO that consistently exceeds its book value.\n* Attract attention to the DAO's products and community by enhancing the investment appeal of the GNO token.\n\n\n**Execution**\nTo maximize the efficiency and minimize the risk of frontrunning, we suggest dividing the $30 million into two equal parts, each allocated to a certain strategy:\n1) $15 million for CoW-TWAP order, executed at any price below the dynamically-calculated book value over a six-month period.\n2) $15 million at the full discretion of Karpatkey, enabling them to capitalize on the most advantageous opportunities.\n\n\nWhile the framework and main details of the program are outlined in the proposal and elaborated on in the forum discussion, we believe the exact details of the asset composition, trading venues, and methods of financing buybacks (e.g., converting altcoins to ETH to be used in the program through market makers, OTC, or onchain), should be managed by Karpatkey. This delegation aims to minimize value leakage and ensure optimal execution.",

      "content": "Abstract\nTo strengthen Gnosis’ positioning as a leader in resilient web3 infrastructure, GnosisDAO would invest into HOPR to foster Gnosis’ focus on privacy. HOPR would then build Gnosis VPN, a truly private and decentralized VPN on top of the HOPR mixnet. To increase Gnosis DAO’s oversight, this effort will be split into two: this proposal and a follow up proposal for further development after initial work has been presented within 9 months.\n\nWithin the framework of this first proposal, HOPR would build a set of VPN (virtual private network) libraries for privately relaying HTTP calls and responses and a proof of concept Gnosis VPN browser extension. Working over the HOPR mixnet, this first extension will give users fully metadata-private access to a set of predefined Gnosis Dapps from their web browsers. In particular, this will allow users to interact with a full suite of crypto services without revealing their IP address or geolocation to the respective web servers.\n\nThese libraries and proof of concept browser extension would be supported with an investment of $1.5m to form the basis for GnosisVPN, a fully decentralized VPN service tailored to web3 users. The scaling and UX work needed to bridge these two versions would be the subject of a future proposal, contingent on the successful completion of the deliverables in this proposal.\n\nIn addition to the product development, GnosisDAO will receive HOPR tokens at a 30% discount on the 90-day $HOPR TWAP, ending on the day the proposal passes for their $1.5m investment.",

      "title": "GIP-90: Should Gnosis.eth update its ENS resolver to resolve .GNO domains on Gnosis Chain?",
      "content": "### Executive Summary ###\n\n.GNO domains is launching on Gnosis Chain, with one of the key features being a CCIP resolver that resolves .GNO domains on ENS. For this to be implemented gnosis.eth is required to update its resolver to the new CCIP resolver being developed.\n\n### Introduction ###\nWe at Gnosis have been working with SpaceID, and DM3 protocol to bring .GNO domains to Gnosis. We call it Genome.\n\nGenome’s mission is to create a digital-ID product centered around .GNO domains, integrating the communities, dApps, and utilities native to Gnosis chain as well as linking .GNO domains with ENS.\n\n### Product Features: ###\n\n- .GNO domains integrated with the Gnosis ecosystem\n- Genome .GNO NFT collection native to Gnosis\n- Developing a CCIP resolver enabling .GNO domains to be resolved on Ethereum via ENS\n- .GNO Integration with current and future JV (Space-ID) partners\n\nGenome is live on testnet! https://test.genomedomains.com/ \n\nENS Resolver Features:\n\nENS defines this standard where an example.eth address can issue text.example.eth on Layer 2 (or another Layer 1 like Gnosis Chain). With no or minimal trust assumptions. \n\nENS’ explainer on CCIP: https://docs.ens.domains/dapp-developer-guide/ens-l2-offchain\nOur CCIP resolver in this case: https://github.com/dm3-org/genome-ccip-resolver (only deployed on Gnosis testnet so far)\n\nNow, each example.gnosis.eth subdomain will also have an example.gno domain. Those are centrally managed by Space-ID.\n\nBoth are linked.\n\n.gno is resolved via https://www.npmjs.com/package/@web3-name-sdk/core\n\n.gnosis.eth is resolved via an up-to-date version of ethersjs for example.\n\nWhen I enter example.gnosis.eth in metamask - for example - the CCIP resolver contract returns a URL to a CCIP-Read client like ethers.js. This URL can be used to perform an off-chain lookup instead of fetching the records from the contract directly.\n\nWhen calling the URL, the Gateway resolves the request by using the Gnosis RPC provider to query the data from the SpaceId contract on the Gnosis Chain. The data returned is signed by the gateway and then returned to the Read Client. To add additional security, the gateway signs the response before, so only “trusted” gateways can be used\n\n### Impact and Benefits ###\nThe main goal of Genome and .GNO domains is increasing ease of access to new and existing users alike. With the increasing costs of building on Ethereum, allowing .GNO domains to resolve on ENS not only lowers costs for owning a domain but also opens up a new set of possibilities for experimentation.\n\n### Proposed Changes / Implementation Plan ###\nENS records for gnosis.eth need to be updated to set the resolver to Genome’s resolver address 0xc9bf092673b3a066df088a2a911e23e9b69b82f2\n( https://github.com/dm3-org/genome-ccip-resolver )\n\n### Team/ Organization/References ###\nRalph X., Gnosis BD\nPhilipp S., Gnosis BD\nAlex Plutta, DM3 Protocol/Corpus Ventures\nEduardo Vega-Patiño, DM3 Protocol/Corpus Ventures",

With the passing of this proposal, GIP-97, GnosisDAO shall vote favourably on the corresponding SafeDAO proposal.\n\n\n\n## Motivation\n\nHaving accomplished the objectives outlined in [SEP #3](https://snapshot.org/#/safe.eth/proposal/0xdcd7f8cb197c7132296d802e538df2a565fbe4f8af400f1afbed06b54a808060), including the creation of a constitution, a governance framework, a system for resource distribution, and the definition of token utility, SafeDAO has completed all the necessary steps for its token transferability.\n\nWith the foundational elements of SafeDAO in place, the focus naturally shifts to the efficient and strategic management of the DAO's assets. Alongside the token transferability, the unlocking of the [joint treasury](https://etherscan.io/address/0xd28b432f06cb64692379758b88b5fcdfc4f56922) between GnosisDAO and SafeDAO will take place. We propose delegating the joint treasury management to karpatkey as part of the mandate.\n\n## Specificaiton\n\nAccording to [GIP-29](https://forum.gnosis.io/t/gip-29-spin-off-safedao-and-launch-safe-token/3476), 5% of the SAFE tokens are allocated to a shared treasury by SafeDAO and GnosisDAO intended to fund rewards beneficial to both the Safe and Gnosis communities.\n\nWe propose that GnosisDAO entrust the management of this collective treasury to karpatkey as an extension of [GIP-58](https://snapshot.org/#/gnosis.eth/proposal/0x867149a44d4f2324520f9f0f8a0d91988b26e4ba4d8662635b29ca733a1354b8). With karpatkey's deep involvement in both projects it is positioned optimally to manage the joint treasury efficiently and align the interests of both communities.\n\nThe joint treasury will be used to create liquid Safe markets with up to 2.5M $SAFE used for incentivising $SAFE DEX liquidity on the Gnosis Chain.\n\nAdditionally, the joint treasury will be used to provide liquidity for Safe on Ethereum and Gnosis Chain as well as support the Safe price. Upon potential diversification of the treasury in the future, karpatkey shall also use these assets for staking (ETH / GNO), LPing or other means to gather yield on the assets. Given the initial 100% treasury composition of native tokens (SAFE), karpatkey will provide a more detailed strategy as these become feasible.\n\nThe joint treasury will be included on our [reports page](https://reports.karpatkey.com/), allowing the community to monitor positions and actions taken with the treasury holdings.\n\n### Implementation\n\nTo implement active treasury management and make the delegation effective the current signers, Safe Foundation and Gnosis DAO, will amend the existing joint treasury safe to a 3/6 MS with 2 karpatkey signers, 4 signers to be appointed by the current signers, and a Module Safe controlled by SafeDAO and GnosisDAO which itself will always have full control over the joint treasury. \n\nA corresponding Safe will also be deployed on Gnosis to expand the joint treasury's presence to the chain.\n\n### Fees\n\n2% annual fee on assets under management, paid in monthly instalments in either ETH, stablecoins or Safe token at the discretion of karpatkey and what is feasible based on the treasury composition.\n\nFees are calculated as `jointTreasury * 0.02 / 12` at 23:59 UTC on the last day of each month and will be paid from the joint treasury.",

      "title": "GIP-94: Should the GnosisDAO approve the “Gnosis Assets Holding I Foundation” for onboarding into Centrifuge Prime?",
      "content": "oted on, provide an overview of the foundation structure, and share next steps.\n\nThis Proposal is an Update to GIP-91\nCentrifuge is pleased to announce the successful snapshot vote on GIP-91 which brings GnosisDAO a large step closer in its ability to diversify the treasury into real-word assets (RWAs). Centrifuge received an overwhelming 96.99% of the governance vote in the snapshot that closed on January 29th. The proposal targeted initial allocations of $10m USD into Centrifuge Prime, through pools such as Anemoy LTF, New Silver, and other available pools.\n\nSince then, the Centrifuge team has been progressing with the operational and legal next steps to ensure a smooth onboarding process. The legal docs, both the MoA and AoA (attached to this post) define the critical processes and structure of a Cayman Foundation Company, which will serve as the RWA Legal Conduit we describe in GIP-91. A summary of such processes and structural matters are set out in this post below, but please refer to the legal docs for more detailed information.\n\nLegal documents are linked right below and at the bottom of this post:\n\nThe Memorandum of Association Here\n\nThe Articles of Association Here\n\nWe are sharing the summary here for the rest of the community with a view to a final proposal being voted on for implementation.\n\nBringing Anemoy Liquid Treasury Fund to GnosisDAO\nCentrifuge is pleased to bring U.S t-bill access to the GnosisDAO treasury via the Anemoy Liquid Treasury Fund. This will provide the DAO access to stable yield uncorrelated to that of DeFi, and importantly, not denominated in volatile assets like Eth/stEth as the treasury mainly utilizes today to earn yield.\n\nSome benefits of the fund structure include:\n\n‍Daily Liquidity: The fund offers daily redemptions in USDC.\nDirect Ownership: The token serves as evidence of ownership, allowing cost-efficient redemptions and providing legal claims on assets.\nInvestor Protection: Prospective investors must adhere to the Know Your Customer (KYC) and anti-money laundering requirements of a BVI-regulated fund, ensuring a secure and transparent investment environment.\nTransparency: Centrifuge provides near real-time onchain visibility of holdings, returns, and tokenized U.S. Treasury Bills.\n\n985×378 19.2 KB\nThe Anemoy Liquid Treasury Fund purchases US Treasury bills at different periods with varying durations, ensuring a revolving set of maturities. The Fund’s investments are T-Bills with 1 month, 3 month and 6 month maturities.\n\nLegal Overview\nThe legal structure will be integrated with Karpatkey, who was mandated by governance to make treasury investment decisions on behalf of the DAO. The principle idea behind the structure is to establish an entity that is capable of signing and fulfilling legal agreements for the benefit of GnosisDAO, ultimately enabling GnosisDAO’s path to legal recourse. This provides a high degree of reliability and security for RWA investments, without compromising the principles and position of the DAO. This framework is based on our extensive experience in MakerDAO setting up similar structures. There, the same structure supports a >$1B in deployed capital.\n\n\n1184×690 244 KB\nThe structure is enabled by the Cayman Islands Foundation Companies act 2017 (the Foundation Act). Under this framework, Centrifuge as part of its services, will set up a foundation company titled the “Gnosis Assets Holding I Foundation.”\n\nThe Articles of Association defines the critical processes and structure of the company such as:\n\nThe company is assigned one nominee director who is responsible for executing and adhering to the mandate of a DAO Resolution or a Delegated Committee Instruction\nThe company may form a Delegated Committee that has a mandate from the DAO to manage its treasury\nA Delegated Committee Instruction is a written set of instructions as scheduled to the Articles of Association and from there established as a legal obligation of the Foundation company.\nA supervisor, responsible for ensuring directors fulfill their duties, and a secretary, responsible for administering the company, are also required roles\nSpecific obligations and procedures for assigning beneficiaries and distributing assets during events such as winding up the company or similar\nA foundation director will be recommended by Centrifuge solely for the purpose to execute orders from the DAO, and acts as a legal signature in the Cayman Islands. The foundation director will implement DAO votes and Delegated Committee Instructions as detailed in the Articles. The DAO has full authority to remove/replace the foundation director at full discretion in a timely manner. As part of Centrifuge’s service offering, the legal conduit/foundation can be repurposed for any of GnosisDAO’s future needs, including for other RWA projects and issuers. Under the current proposal, the target max allocation is $10M to be focused mainly in U.S t-bills, but also diversified in other credit strategies Centrifuge offers if desired.\n\nThe Initial foundation company secretary shall be Leeward Management Limited\n\nLeeward Management Limited is a leading fiduciary and governance services provider in the Cayman Islands. The service company is well positioned to fulfill work on behalf of a DAO as it is specialized in dealing with Digital Assets, specifically RWA structured products.\n\n“With the rapid institutionalization of digital assets, having independent, non-executive directors who provide investors and stakeholders with an added layer of transparency, accountability and expertise is often a critical element to ensuring a project’s success.”\n\nGlenn Kennedy will be appointed foundation director as approved by both Centrifuge and GnosisDAO.\n\nDue to our relationship with Leeward in using them in several other similar projects, Centrifuge is able to provide a cost effective deal. Ongoing per annum governance and corporate expenses of USD 40k consist of fees for the independent foundation director and foundation supervisor.\n\nNext Steps in order:\nLeave posted legal docs to the community forum(in this post) for seven days as a period for feedback\nOpen a snapshot vote to ratify the docs\nSetting up the foundation takes ~10 days\nBegin the KYC process between the foundation director and Anemoy that will take a week or less\nInvestments can then take place immediately\n*Once the DAO has voted and reached the necessary quorum, the Foundation can be set-up immediately.\n\nThe Memorandum of Association is a document that contains all the conditions which are required for the registration of the company. Articles: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1TQwIUj8_04jL3WdCeb_xJDePfyl2U4ws/view?usp=drive_link\n\nThe Articles of Association is a document that contains the rules and regulations for the administration of the company.

      "content": "https://forum.gnosis.io/t/gip-93-should-gnosisdao-support-the-integration-of-hashi-within-gnosis-chains-canonical-bridges/8245\n\n### Category\nFunding\n\n### Executive Summary:\nThis proposal presents a detailed plan for allocating funds towards integrating the Hashi protocol into Gnosis Chain’s canonical bridges from Ethereum, namely the xDAI Bridge and the AMB (on which the OmniBridge is built). The initiative emphasizes significantly enhancing the security and decentralization of these bridges. The integration aims to introduce advanced security measures, mitigate systemic risks, and ensure the Gnosis Chain ecosystem remains resilient against the evolving landscape of security threats. By fortifying the infrastructure with Hashi, we seek to establish a new standard for security and reliability in cross-chain transactions.\nHashi is an additive security framework, currently supporting 15+ General Message Passing bridges and ZK light clients. With its integration on Gnosis bridges we remove any reliance on one specific bridging mechanism and add the ability to define threshold based bridging (only when 2 of 3 bridges agree a bridge transaction is accepted) along with zero vendor lock-in capabilities by allowing easy replacement of any bridging mechanisms in the future.\n\nThis integration will make Gnosis Chain the only L1 with such strong bridge security guarantees. We anticipate that this effort will foster greater user confidence and will have a big positive impact on the Gnosis ecosystem.\n\n### Specification\nThe proposal outlines a multi-faceted approach, focusing on:\n\n* Developing an Integration Plan and Reference implementation\nTailoring Hashi’s protocol to enhance the security properties of the canonical bridges. This requires the writing of dedicated technical documents, specifications and the development of a reference implementation.\n\n* Conducting Extensive Security Audits\nPartnering with leading blockchain security firms to conduct end-to-end audits, identifying and addressing potential vulnerabilities within the proposed integration framework.\n\n* Executing the Migration\nUpgrading the existing canonical bridges with the new proposed integration framework. This will be done in strict cooperation with the existing team in charge of Gnosis Chain Bridges.\n\n* Governance configuration\nThe current Gnosis Bridges multisig (8 of 15) will be configured to set the thresholds and allowed oracles. In the future this governance can be also replaced and improved if needed.\n\n### Rationale\nIn an era where security breaches and exploits have become increasingly sophisticated, bolstering the security and decentralization of Gnosis Chain’s bridges is imperative. Currently, both bridges are secured by a decentralized but still permissioned and trusted set of validators. Although battle tested throughout the years, the Gnosis community and GnosisDAO have realized the need to move to a more trust minimized and future-proof setup.\n\nThis proposal is driven by the vision of creating a fortified, resilient infrastructure capable of withstanding current and future security challenges. The Gnosis Community has already shown in the past a strong commitment to these values by supporting similar efforts (i.e. __[GIP-57](https://forum.gnosis.io/t/gip-57-should-gnosis-dao-support-research-of-a-zksnark-enabled-light-client-and-bridge/5421)__ and the __[addition of Succinct’s ZK Light Client as a Validator](https://blog.succinct.xyz/omnibridge/)__, among others) and by bringing to life the Hashi project itself.\nThis integration represents a strategic step forward in safeguarding assets and data, ensuring the Gnosis Chain remains a secure, trusted, and highly attractive platform for users and developers alike.\n\nLastly, Gnosis DAO has demonstrated in the past how important bridge security is to them. This proposal aims to implement previous research results and reap tangible benefits.\n\n### Budget\nThe budget is meticulously structured to cover all critical aspects of the integration process:\n\n* Hashi Integration Design and Development: $60,000 allocated towards developing and implementing the Hashi integration.\n\n* Security Audits and Migration Strategies: $90,000 dedicated to coordinating rigorous security audits and the formulation of robust mitigation strategies. \n\n* Preparation and Execution of the Migration: $80,000 allocated to an in-depth study of the recommended configuration options and execution of the migration plan with the assistance of GnosisDAO.\n\n* Monitoring the guarded launch and safeguards lifting: $20,000 dedicated to monitoring the initial launch with safeguards in place and securely lifting them after the initial guarded phase.\n\n#### Milestones:\n\n* Milestone 1: Hashi Integration Design and Implementation (Duration: 2 months)\n\n  * Deliverables:\n\n    * Development of a detailed security-centric design document and spec for Hashi’s integration with the 2 canonical bridges of \nGnosis Chain.\n    * Implementation of a reference code following the specifications.\n  * Funding Allocation: $60,000\n\n* Milestone 2: Security Audits and Migration Plan (Duration: 2 months)\n\n  * Deliverables:\n\n    * Completion of external security audits with documented findings and implemented fixes.\n    * Development and launch of a Hashi explorer, a tool to oversee the validation progress of cross-chain transactions on Gnosis bridges.\n    * Coordination on a possible Migration Plan as needed by Milestone 3.\n  * Funding Allocation: $90,000\n\n* Milestone 3: Preparation and Execution of the Migration of the Existing Bridges to the New Solution (Duration: 2 months)\n\n  * Deliverables:\n\n    * Case Study to present the recommended configuration options for Hashi.\n    * Final coordination with the Gnosis Chain team on the Migration Plan execution.\n    * Integration and coordination with all available oracle teams (the ones available on the Ethereum > Gnosis chain route from the total 17) and setup ZK light clients.\n    * Execution of the migration on the Chiado testnet.\n    * Analysis of testnet outcomes.\n    * Execution of the migration for the Gnosis Chain’s canonical bridges.\n    * Comprehensive report detailing the integration’s impact on security and decentralization metrics, including community feedback and usage statistics.\n  * Funding Allocation: $80,000\n\n* Milestone 4: Monitoring the guarded launch and safeguards lifting.\n\n  * Deliverables:\n\n    * Hashi as a validator on both Gnosis chain canonical bridges.\n    * Monitoring of Hashi’s consistency with the current validator set.\n    * Hashi as a mandatory validator.\n  * Funding Allocation: $20,000\n\n* Continued maintenance: Close to the end of the implementation of this proposal, a new proposal will be drafted covering the ongoing maintenance costs (Engineering, DevOps, and ZK Provers), expected to total $100,000-$150,000 per year. ZK prover costs cover the infrastructure costs (not gas), which currently are expected to decrease over time with the optimization work currently in progress by most ZK teams. Currently running just one Prover costs $60,000 / year.\n\nThe above pricing incorporates a significant discount due to the long and supportive relationship between Hashi and GnosisDAO.\n\n### Evaluation\nSuccess will be evaluated based on the seamless integration of Hashi and the absence of significant downtimes during the coordinated migration process. Additionally, positive feedback from the Gnosis Chain community will serve as an indicator of the integration’s success and its impact on enhancing the ecosystem’s security posture.\n\n### Team\nThe Cross-chain Interoperability Alliance, the core development team of Hashi, comprises 3 people including 1 project manager and 2 blockchain engineers/security experts with a proven track record in developing cross-chain solutions and in pioneering stronger security guarantees in the space. The 3 team members have 4, 8 and 12 years of blockchain working experience respectively. This experience is critical in ensuring the successful execution of this proposal.\n\n### Conclusion\nThrough this proposal, we aim to significantly elevate the security and decentralization standards of the Gnosis Chain’s canonical bridges. The strategic integration of Hashi not only mitigates systemic risks but also positions Gnosis Chain as a leader in secure, decentralized cross-chain communications, all this while capitalizing on previous GnosisDAO’s investments.",

      "title": "GIP-91: Should the GnosisDAO onboard into Centrifuge Prime?",
      "content": "Executive Summary\nThis proposal initiates the onboarding of GnosisDAO into Centrifuge Prime by investing part of the treasury into Real-world assets (RWAs). The onboarding will be contingent upon the establishment of a Legal Conduit for GnosisDAO by Centrifuge for the safe investment of RWAs. This proposal will integrate existing treasury management processes and services providers such as karpatkey DAO. The benefit of this proposal will provide the GnosisDAO Treasury with an additional diversified source of yield, a resilient legal infrastructure for engaging with RWA investments, and access to additional diversified sources of credit through Centrifuge.\n\nService Description\nThis proposal initiates the onboarding of GnosisDAO into Centrifuge Prime to invest part of the treasury into RWAs. Centrifuge will provide the services to establish a legal structure that supports safe RWA investments, integrates GnosisDAO’s treasury management processes, establishes any technical integrations needed, and facilitates the curation of a diversified investment portfolio.\n\nOnce established, this proposal targets an initial allocation of $10m USD into Centrifuge Prime, through pools such as Anemoy LTF, New Silver 1, and other available pools.\n\nCentrifuge has been collaborating closely with karpatkey DAO and GnosisDAO contributors on a variety of RWA initiatives within the Gnosis ecosystem. Beyond bringing new exposure to the GnosisDAO treasury, possible ideas include:\n\ndeploying Centrifuge Liquidity Pools directly on Gnosis Chain;\nleveraging the Centrifuge Securitization Engine for the issuance of unique pools for the Gnosis community; and\nexploring deeper partnerships with specific parties and efforts inside the Gnosis ecosystem.\nWe view this proposal as the first step in bringing the Gnosis and Centrifuge ecosystems more closely together and establishing a flourishing partnership for Real World Assets in DeFi and Gnosis Chain.\n\nKey aspects\nThis proposal will accomplish:\n\nEstablishing a Legal Conduit for the safe investment of real-world assets.\nIntegrating the existing treasury management process to utilize this conduit.\nFacilitating ongoing management tasks including portfolio and asset curation, reporting via the Centrifuge Credit Group, and dedicated technical and user support.\nThe Legal Conduit\n\nThe legal structure will be integrated with DAO governance to ultimately be owned and operated by GNOtoken holders. The principle idea behind the structure is to establish an entity that is capable of signing and fulfilling legal agreements on behalf of the DAO, ultimately enabling GnosisDAO’s path to legal recourse. This provides a high degree of reliability and security for RWA investments, without compromising the principles and position of the DAO.\n\n\n1600×936 178 KB\nThis framework is based on our extensive experience in MakerDAO setting up similar 1 structures. There, the same structure supports a >$1B in deployed capital.\n\nWhile the legal conduit is initially intended to facilitate an investment by GnosisDAO into RWA offered through Centrifuge Prime, the same structure could potentially also be used to diversify GnosisDAO’s treasury into RWAs available through other platforms/issuers/brokers, thereby expanding the scope of treasury management activities currently available to the DAO.\n\nIntegrated Management Process\n\nGnosisDAO has an existing sophisticated and high-quality non custodial treasury management process, pioneered and led by karpatkey DAO. The services in this proposal will be fully integrated to support the existing processes efficiently, while also supporting any future developments within the DAO. These processes and overall structure will be developed in collaboration with the Gnosis community.\n\nOngoing Management and Support\n\nCentrifuge Prime provides dedicated access to the Centrifuge ecosystem and community. As part of this proposal, the Centrifuge team will work directly with karpatkey DAO to provide ongoing support for the RWA portfolio allocated through Prime.\n\nThis will involve ecosystem and pipeline management with dedicated relationships to high-quality asset managers, service providers, and other actors necessary to maintain and curate a diversified RWA portfolio. The Centrifuge Credit Group, a DAO entity setup to provide risk and credit analysis, can be utilized to provide general-purpose reporting for investors. This provides an additional level of ongoing monitoring and independent analysis for karpatkey DAO and the community to utilize.\n\nFinally, Centrifuge is committed to providing technical and user support to the Gnosis community. This includes community education and engagement, support for technical integrations, and dedicated support to the investment and portfolio management team.\n\nBeyond US treasuries, the Centrifuge Prime setup would also allow the Gnosis DAO to allocate into the following asset classes:\n\nBucket Focus\tDescription\tTargeted Returns\tLiquidity Thresholds\nLiquidity\tLowest risk while maintaining US Treasuries, MMF, AA+ rated short term bonds\t5-6%\tDaily\nPreservation\tInvestments in senior secured loans such as real estate, corporate bonds etc.\t6-8%\t3-6 months\nAcceleration\tTrade finance, non-bank originators, emerging markets\t8-20%\t3-24mo\nService Scope - Describe the scope of the service, including any limitations or exclusions that apply.\nThe scope of services described above intends to cover the RWA investments made through Centrifuge Prime.\n\nService delivery - Give an overview of how the service will be delivered, including any key processes, procedures, or technologies.\nThe process for establishing the legal conduit is as follows:\n\nThe Centrifuge contributor team will retain external legal counsel in the Cayman Islands to represent the Gnosis DAO’s interests. The results of this work will be presented to the Gnosis DAO, and the community will have time to process, provide feedback, and otherwise request changes in the legal structure. The structure will only be implemented and executed with DAO approval, via the requisite process as requested by the community.\n\nThe follow-on processes and procedures will be developed over further collaboration with the community.\n\nSupport - Provide a brief description of the support services that are provided.\nThe support services are mentioned above.\n\nPricing and payment\nThe pricing for this proposal is structured to streamline fees. The usage of GNO as a reward helps to align incentives towards long-term interests versus short-term benefits.\n\nThe fee structure is as follows:\n\nFees\t\t\nStructural Setup\tup to 50,000 USDC\tTo be paid immediately into a Safe controlled by Centrifuge to pay for lawyers and Cayman service providers to set up a Cayman foundation company to the benefit of the Gnosis DAO, any unused budget will be returned to the GnosisDAO treasury. The structure may require ongoing fees but will be assessed on a periodic basis and only after approval from the DAO.\nPortfolio Fee\t0.35% p.a. on assets in Prime up to $50M, 0.2% $50-100M, 0.1% >$100M\tAccrued on an ongoing basis to Centrifuge for maintenance and support and payable upon redemption.\nGnosis Rewards\t250 GNO, paid incrementally over 12 months into the Centrifuge treasury, starting with the first $1M Deployment into Centrifuge Prime. GNO would be locked for a period of 12 months.\tTo cover costs of resource and facilitation time for the development of the infrastructure and processes. Centrifuge DAO intends for this to create better alignment with strong skin in the game incentives for success.\nService Terms and Exit Strategy\nCentrifuge Prime can be unwound and offboarded with 30 days’ notice. The positions and structures can be off-boarded entirely or transferred to new ownership. Investments themselves will be subject to the policies of the investment contract, but can also be unwound.\n\nTeam/Organization\nCentrifuge has a long track record of working with DAOs to bring RWAs on as collateral. Notable firsts include minting MakerDAO’s first real-world asset, structuring the first on chain securitization, launching the RWA Market with Aave, and partnering with BlockTower to bring the first credit fund operations on chain. Centrifuge Prime is built for the needs of large decentralized organizations. It provides the infrastructure and services to quickly and easily onboard and scale a fully diversified portfolio of real-world assets. Through Centrifuge Prime, decentralized organizations can get access to an institutional ecosystem of RWA partners and service providers.\n\nCentrifuge is a DAO-governed protocol. K/Factory contributes to the Centrifuge protocol by providing development, and infrastructure, and working with users to ensure adoption.\n\nMore contributor information can be found on the Centrifuge website 2.\n\nConclusion\nThis proposal represents a significant step forward for the Gnosis community in its RWA engagement. Centrifuge Prime is an optimal solution for developing a diversified RWA portfolio that the DAO can integrate into its existing treasury management solutions. Centrifuge has collaborated with karpatkey DAO on the development of this proposal and, with support from the Gnosis Community, would like to continue this collaboration to add additional exposure to the GnosisDAO treasury.",

      "title": "GIP-89: Should GnosisDAO support an annual renewal for Blockscout SLA and hosting services?",
      "content": "Blockscout continues to serve the Gnosis ecosystem with an open-source explorer for both the Gnosis mainnet and Chiado testnet instances. Blockscout hosting was originally funded in GIP 54 for mainnet and GIP 71 for the Chiado testnet.\n\nOver the past year, Blockscout has attracted and retained Gnosis users and developers, providing a valuable explorer option and needed redundancy for chain exploration. While Gnosis mainnet users can choose Gnosisscan or Blockscout for their exploration, contract verification, and API needs, Blockscout is currently the only full-featured explorer serving the Chiado execution layer.\n\nWhile Blockscout usage is down somewhat from its peak when it was the only explorer option for the chain, many users still prefer Blockscout. A few high level statistics from GA & Mixpanel:\n\n~45K monthly views, 9.5K MAU for Gnosis Mainnet Blockscout instance.\n~100 contracts verified in the previous month using Blockscout.\n~1,000 signups to myAccount since the feature was introduced.\n~550 Marketplace views over the previous month.\n~7K monthly views for Chiado.\nAdditional chain stats (not instance specific) are available at Gnosis chain statistics | Blockscout.\n\nOver the past year Blockscout has focused on optimizations and improvements which have been upstreamed to the Gnosis instances on a priority basis. These include a complete UI overhaul, multiple indexer upgrades, advanced statistics and the new MyAccount and Dapp Marketplace features.\n\nUpdates scheduled for the upcoming year include:\n\nAdvanced filtering and sorting options\nHuman readable transactions\nNFT views and explorer improvements\nSmart search with AI\nMore Rust-based microservices\nSupport for ENS and ENS forks\n\nProject Deliverables\n\nContinue to maintain Blockscout instances for Gnosis Chain and Chiado testnet on Blockscout’s premises\nHosting services for the Gnosis Chain and Chiado testnet (for a period of 1 year with an option to extend)\nHosting at blockscout.com (for a period of 1 year with an option to extend)\nPremium feature updates\nPriority SLA to ensure uptime and troubleshoot any issues with Gnosis development team\nSupport for end-users of the explorer managed via Discord\n\nExecution Timeline\n\nStart time\n\nProposed start time for the renewal is October 1, 2023.\n\nPrevious services for the hosted mainnet instance began on July 17, 2022 and officially expired on July 18, 2023 (per GIP 54) . Since that time we have hosted the mainnet instance at our own cost. We propose crediting 2 weeks (July 18-July 31) and receiving back payments for 2 months (August and September) of hosting services in addition to the new annual engagement cost.\nPrevious payment for the Chiado testnet was received on November 29, 2022 and scheduled to extend through Nov 29, 2023. We propose reducing the time for this support by 2 months, so that the new engagement can begin and end at the same time as mainnet.\nNew proposed timeline: Gnosis Mainnet and Chiado testnet will be supported from October 1, 2023 - October 1, 2024.\nIf the proposal is still in consideration on Oct 1 but no final decision has been made, hosting and support will continue without interruption until the governance process is completed, and the timeline will be amended accordingly.\n\nFunding & Disbursement\n\nHosting costs cover high-capacity bandwidth, infrastructure upgrades, data storage (2000GiB and growing), and devops for the networks. Feature enhancements and priority support are also included as part of the package.\n\nOver the past year we have analyzed instance usage and optimized our backend infrastructure and processes, and are happy to offer a discount on pricing for the instances ($500 less per month relative to 2022 pricing). Chiado testnet pricing is scoped as a 2nd instance, resulting in a lower cost.\n\nGnosis Chain Mainnet: $112,000.00\n\n$8,000 per month for 14 months (August and September 2023 + 1 year of service 1 October, 2023 - 1 October, 2024)\nChiado Testnet: $40,000\n\n$4,000 per month for 10 months (credit of October and November 2023 + 1 year of service 1 October, 2023 - 1 October, 2024)\nTotal cost: $152,000.00 due 1 October, 2023\n\nAmount is requested up front for the year. Payment can be made to Blockscout’s SAFE 0xAddress on Ethereum mainnet (0x242ba6d68FfEb4a098B591B32d370F973FF882B7) with USDC or USDT.",

      "title": "GIP-88: Should Gnosis Chain provide liquidity for Circles Group Currencies in collaboration w/Proof of Humanity?",
      "content": "http://forum.gnosis.io/t/gip-88-should-gnosis-chain-provide-liquidity-for-circles-group-currencies-in-collaboration-w-proof-of-humanity/6983\n\nauthor: Julio Linares, Clément Lesaege \n\n\nExecutive Summary:\n\nCirclesUBI is a dapp running on Gnosis Chain which distributes a Universal Basic Income (UBI) via a P2P mesh credit protocol. Recently, a secondary issuance mechanism has been developed, called Group Currencies, as a way to bridge Circles to state money systems and crypto-assets. We propose that Gnosis Chain provides liquidity to two specific group currencies: the BER group currency administered by the Circles Coop e.G. and the Proof of Humanity (POH) group currency administered by the POH Origin team. By partnering with projects like Monerium, the goal is to pave the way to position Circles as a leading real world payment application that provides a UBI to people worldwide, strengthening the Gnosis ecosystem. The total costs of the project are 1,700,000 EUR for a period of one year from the moment the proposal gets accepted by the Gnosis DAO.\n\nSpecification\n\nCircles (CRC) are minted as personal currencies at a rate of roughly 1 CRC per 1 hour or 24 CRC per day, with a yearly 7% demurrage on the money supply to incentivise circulation. The current socially agreed exchange rate of CRC to e.g. Euros is roughly 10:1. Group currencies are minted on a 1:1 basis, so that for each group currency minted, one personal currency gets deposited and locked into a specific treasury. Group currencies have three modes of issuance or minting:\n\n1. Only the owner can mint.\n2. Only the group can mint.\n3. Everyone can mint.\n\nIn order to test group currencies at a larger scale, the following proposal seeks to grant the ability to exchange Circles group currencies for the following groups:\n\n1. Proof of Humanity (Origin): in order to establish a clear collaboration and integration between POH-Origin and CirclesUBI, we propose a group currency that is used by POH-Origin users who join the Circles POH group currency as part of their basic income distribution system. POH is a sybil resistance registry that wants to use Circles group currency for UBI distribution. We propose that Gnosis Chain commits to fund a total of 500.000 EUR to bring liquidity onto their group currency (the liquidity will stay owned by the Gnosis DAO). More information about POH's recent fork can be found [here](https://gov.proofofhumanity.id/t/phase-3-binding-hip-74-a-peaceful-fork/2487). Technically, the PoH system would have a group currency manager for the creation of its Circles group currency. More details of that can be found [here](https://gist.github.com/AndreiMVP/63fe2376400ebb89ece633646aa8c625). For more technical information you can find a GitHub repository for the POH GC, which includes a README, [here](https://github.com/Proof-Of-Humanity/group-currency) Additionally, [here](https://hackmd.io/@andreimvp/pohgct-guide) you can read a more in-depth presentation/ testing guide for the PoH Group Currency. We believe strong synergies can come from this collaboration between Circles and Proof of Humanity (Origin) in the space, both powered by Gnosis chain.\n\n2. [Circles Coop](http://circles.coop/) eG: as part of the ongoing Berlin Open Pilot, the Circles Coop provides Euros in exchange for CRC that businesses accept in return for goods and services as a way of increasing fungibility of CRC and incentivising local trade, enabling a people-powered, bottom-up basic income. You can see more about the work of the Circles Coop [here](https://vimeo.com/769402776). An analysis of the Berlin network (December 2022) by the NetFi team at [Freiburg Institute of Basic Income Studies](https://www.fribis.uni-freiburg.de/en/fribis/) can be accessed [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1husreoJz3HQq9_C0LXRMiGRoC_hL5Uvxds9UwzTeeoI/edit?usp=sharing) (using novel network science methods).\n\nBER Exchange\n\nNow that we have established an active economic network in Berlin with over 2000 individual participants and 20 merchant partners, the goal of the Circles Coop for the next year is to leverage BER to create a sustainable community-driven investment environment for small and medium businesses within the circles network in order to expand the basic income economy. The group currency administered by the Circles Coop will be called \"BER'', after Berlin. The BER will be backed by production of goods and services coming from business sales in CRC. For the first years, we envision BER will be issued as a service by the Circles Coop based on the CRC that businesses in the network send to the Coop on a 1:1 basis. The Circles Coop will maintain a list of trustees or people who commit to give labour, capital or land to the network for the issuance of BER and other trade partners of the B2B network. After more knowledge and experience is gathered from the workings of BER on the Circles' web of trust, the Coop will begin to experiment with distributing group issuance rules to the wider economic network.\n\n* BER will be sold for Euro-e to community investors at a discount.\n* Euro-e will be given to the businesses in the Berlin network either as direct zero/low interest loans or as part of the ongoing pilot program.\n* Community investors can use BER to buy goods and services or sell BER back for Euro-e at a fixed rate. This means that for the first year businesses can only access BER through their own sales or by buying/selling BER with Euro-e from other businesses or community investors.\n\nCo-payment API & Multi-Token Display:\n\nIn order to do this, our aim is to make it easier for people and businesses to co-pay with their CRC & BER by enabling Euros-e payments and multi-token display of balances. The Circles Coop will leverage [Monerium](https://monerium.com/)’s Euro-e stable coin, running on Gnosis, to develop a product that allows businesses to withdraw and deposit Euro-e tokens to and from their [circles.garden](https://circles.garden/) safe wallet. Monerium is a SEPA authorised and regulated Euro stable coin. Users of Circles will be able to open a Monerium account with an IBAN to deposit Euro-e tokens to their Circles safe in order to use the open co-payment API functionality that we will develop. Businesses can sell things at a discount in Euros and benefit from higher sales experienced from participating in the Circles network. The Euro-e fee revenues generated are transparent and can be split as distributed equity for Circles users within the web of trust, for the pilot business costs and to cover the Coop's operational costs in order to break even. The end result is fully distributed credit issuance and internal liquidity provision made possible by the Circles mesh credit p2p protocol and distributed equity through the revenues generated from trade and investments to real production in the form of co-payment fees & community investment in BER.\n\nThe proposal would be to fund the Circles Coop with 1.2 million EUR from the moment this proposal becomes effective for a period of 12 months to:\n\n* develop the co-payment API functionality in the [circles.garden](https://circles.garden/) client and [marketplace](https://market.joincircles.net/en) with Euro-e and BER\n* Enable Euro-e, BER & CRC multi-token displays.\n* develop the BER/Euro-e exchange functionality for the Berlin pilot (500k EUR)\n* Research & Development (see below)\n\nPart of this budget will be assigned by the Circles Coop to the [Bitspossessed](https://bitspossessed.org/) developer collective (600k). The Bitspossessed have been responsible for maintaining and developing the core Circles UBI infrastructure and client (circles.garden) since [Sarah Friend](https://isthisa.com/) and [Andreas Dzialocha](https://adz.garden/) co-founded the Bitspossessed after technicaly launching CirclesUBI in October 2020, with the unconditional support from [Martin Koppelmann](https://twitter.com/koeppelmann). As the Circles Protocol is non-for-profit and meant to be a commons, the project relies on grants and public/private donations for its operations at scale. Having a budget for core development secured by the GnosisDAO will ensure the continued success of the project and group currencies as a whole. The Circles Coop's operational non-development costs will be secured by external private donations while the revenues generated from BER and co-payments are established, tested and proven to work. The Circles Coop aims to develop an open reproducible revenue model that allows other organised cooperatives, businesses and groups doing Circles to earn a revenue and break-even from fees in Euro-e/fiat co-payments, fiat withdrawals and deposits and group currency exchange fees.\n\nOur end goal and vision for the future is to develop a multi-currency p2p privacy-preserving payment app that brings investment for local economies to thrive everywhere via CirclesUBI.\n\nThe Circles Coop eG commits to sharing the progress, main learnings and achievements in Q3 of 2024 before applying to further funding from the GnosisDAO community.\n\nFrom mid 2024 to 2025, our aim is to develop with others in the ecosystem a Community Currency Exchange as a stand-alone product to decentralise and incentivise investment in group currencies in a privacy-preserving way. You can read more about the Circles Coop [here](https://circles.coop/) and about our recent work on anonymous circles or the Circles [Entropy Black Paper](https://circlesentropy.github.io/blackpaper/).\n\nResearch\n\nIn order to understand better what the different risk profiles and trade-offs of group currencies will be, we would like to include a budget to fund the research work of BlockScience and Circles Coop Research team, who will work in understanding and modelling what effects will the introduction of group currencies have on the Circles web of trust network as a whole, providing a \"digital twin\" of Circles with the capacity to perform deterministic backtesting and to perform extrapolation under stylized scenarios. One of the product outcomes of research is to determine, using network science, when an account is a real person or not and create the necessary metrics and detection mechanisms for sybil resistance. To that end, we request a total of 100k EUR to fund the great work of [Blockscience](https://block.science/) and the Circles Coop research team for a period of six months.\n\nTimeline for Circles Coop:\n\nResearch and Design (3 months): includes market research, design research, design work on ideation, mock-ups for new features, user stories, risk management on legal and economic fronts, network science and agent based modelling research, fine tuning business model, ongoing maintenance, stabilisation and improvement of technical infrastructure. Additionally, here we will review and do an audit of the group currency contracts to make sure everything is secure before deployment.\n\nDecision-Making and Planning Implementation (1 month): Systematize and cross-analyze all the information gathered. Establish a common roadmap in all domains to implement agreed features, prepare campaigns for general users, improve Coop's BER minting and EUR redeeming procedures, start with design research for [marketplace](http://www.market.joincircles.net) integration, ongoing maintenance and stabilisation of technological infrastructure.\n\nFeatures Development and Implementation Phase 1 (3-4 months): Launch campaign to prepare users for new features. Work on the feature of multi-token display to start users getting used to this possibility, preparing circles.garden backend and marketplace for co-payment API. Test, adjust and launch first features. Design processes and platforms for community investment. Prepare a communication campaign to reach out to community investors. Ongoing maintenance and stabilisation of technological infrastructure. \n\nFeatures Development and Implementation Phase 2 (3-4 months): Developing, testing and launching co-payment API features both on circles.garden and the marketplace. Campaign to introduce co-payment and start introducing economic justice/social investment narrative. Ongoing maintenance and stabilisation of technological infrastructure. Lastly, work will go into research and design of a currency exchange platform for Q3 2024.\n\nMilestones: \n\nQ1: first stage of Group Currency research completed, GC contract audits fully done. \n\nQ2: Design of features and workflows of GC \n partially completed.  Architecture & spec for payment API defined. \n\nQ3: Design of features and workflows of GC completed. Testnet goes live to begin testing features and assumptions. Second stage of research completed. \n\nQ4: Group Currency and co-payments implemented on the circles.garden wallet and marketplace \n\n\n Budget\n\nTo summarise, the breakdown of the total budget of this proposal will be assigned as follows:\n\nTo Proof of Humanity Origin Team:\n\n* 500k EUR for POH group currency. This liquidity belongs to GnosisDAO and will go to the users of POH directly. The idea is to provide liquidity on PHC (Proof of Humanity Circles). The money will be used to build a liquidity position of DAI-PHC.\nSince there wouldn't be any liquidity initially, the POH team will need to buy it overtime to avoid slippage, for around 50k€ of PHC over 5 months.\nThe POH team can handle those operations and then send the liquidity tokens to the GnosisDAO.\nGiving the exact operations may be hard as price of PHC may vary.\n\nProof of Humanity's Gnosis Chain Safe: 0x636a9f58182B8132A08777A8De0Ca0f63bc0C3aa\n\nTo Circles Coop e.G.:\n\n- 100k EUR for Research collaboration with Blockscience and the Circles Coop Research team (July 2023 to June 2024). Paid in DAI or USDC.\n\n- 600k EUR for the Bitspossessed CirclesUBI Dev Team (July 2023 to June 2024). Paid in DAI or USDC.\n\nBerlin CirclesUBI Pilot:\n\n* 500k EUR for BER Pilot - as a commitment to exchange the Group currency (BER) for DAI or USDC. This liquidity belongs to GnosisDAO and will go to the businesses in the pilot directly. The BER minted will be sent to the Gnosis Treasury team in exchange for the stable coin at a fixed rate of ~10 BER to 1 Euro with a small discounted exchange fee as incentives for merchants. In the future proposals to GnosisDAO, we plan to create a social dex (community currency exchange) to allow for different forms of mutual staking, direct loans to the B2B network and more, in order to make the operation economically sustainable.\n\nCircles Coop's Gnosis Chain Safe: 0xd9B58990cef69c2d222fD8f8CAf53477C5B79E28\n\nTotal:\n\n1.7 million EUR for a period of one year.\n\nA more detailed cost breakdown is given [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ORy9d2pw7IJoub05s5MuVLBD3kRyUqpQmJnMG1KhdR4/edit#gid=1813060761). \n\nFunding should be given for the respective team public addresses present in this proposal.\n\nWe look forward to our collaboration.\n\nCircles Coop e.G & Proof of Humanity Origin",

      "title": "GIP-87: Should GnosisDAO claim its vested GEL allocation and delegate it along with COW to governance Safe managed by karpatkey?",
      "content": "## Summary\nThis proposal triggers the Gnosis DAO Safe to claim the fully vested GEL tokens from Gelato and then delegate the voting power of GEL and COW to the governance Safe managed by karpatkey following GIP-58.\n\n## Motivation\n#### GEL\nFollowing Gelato’s community vote on accelerating the GEL vesting 1, GEL tokens have been fully vested on the Gnosis DAO since the 27th of February, 2023.\n\nHowever, these tokens are not being put to any use in the Gnosis ecosystem. By enabling the Gnosis DAO to claim the vested GEL tokens and delegate their voting power to the karpatkey’s governance Safe, we can ensure that these tokens are contributing to shape the future of Gelato.\n\nkarpatkey has been managing the Gnosis DAO treasury since GIP-20, having later extended the range of services through GIP-58. Through our strong relationship with Gnosis DAO, we can actively manage the voting power of GEL to benefit the Gnosis DAO. The complete amount vested to Gnosis DAO is 5,258,625 GEL—and these are not intended to be sold.\n\nThe claimable GEL amount would put Gnosis DAO in 9th place 3 of the current GEL holders.\n\n#### COW\nFurthermore, the Gnosis DAO has access to 48.5MM COW voting power on CoW DAO. This voting power consists of 47472327.585 vCOW and 1027672.415 COW.\n\nFor vCOW, Gnosis DAO currently has the second largest share of 14.35%, and for COW, Gnosis DAO holds 0.1028% of the current circulating supply.\n\nkarpatkey can also vote on the Gnosis DAO’s behalf and ensure the mutually beneficial growth of both Gnosis DAO and CoW DAO as karpatkey has been working together with CoW DAO since the creation of the Core Treasury Team (CIP-19 1).\n\n## Specification\nThe proposal includes the following steps:\n\nClaim first batch of vested GEL token: 2,629,312 GEL\nClaim second batch of vested GEL token: 2,629,312 GEL\nDelegate the voting power for GEL on Snapshot to karpatkey’s governance Safe eth:0x8787FC2De4De95c53e5E3a4e5459247D9773ea52\nDelegate the voting power for COW on Snapshot to karpatkey’s governance Safe eth:0x8787FC2De4De95c53e5E3a4e5459247D9773ea52\n\n## Implementation\nThe snapshot vote, if successful, will trigger two claims on Gelato Governance Dashboard 4 and then delegate the voting power of GEL and COW on snapshot to eth:0x8787FC2De4De95c53e5E3a4e5459247D9773ea52, karpatkey’s governance Safe.\n\n- Proposed .json for Snapshot:\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"to\": \"0x4A7c7652aBd5E5e3467C458E42493630AAA7DDD6\",\n    \"operation\": 0,\n    \"value\": \"0\",\n    \"method\": \"withdraw(address receiver_, uint256 vestingId_, address to_, uint256 value_)\",\n    \"params\": [\n      \"0x0da0c3e52c977ed3cbc641ff02dd271c3ed55afe\",\n      \"0\",\n      \"0x0da0c3e52c977ed3cbc641ff02dd271c3ed55afe\",\n      \"2629312500000000000000000\"\n    ]\n  },\n  {\n    \"to\": \"0x4A7c7652aBd5E5e3467C458E42493630AAA7DDD6\",\n    \"operation\": 0,\n    \"value\": \"0\",\n    \"method\": \"withdraw(address receiver_, uint256 vestingId_, address to_, uint256 value_)\",\n    \"params\": [\n      \"0x0da0c3e52c977ed3cbc641ff02dd271c3ed55afe\",\n      \"1\",\n      \"0x0da0c3e52c977ed3cbc641ff02dd271c3ed55afe\",\n      \"2629312500000000000000000\"\n    ]\n  },\n  {\n    \"to\": \"0x469788fE6E9E9681C6ebF3bF78e7Fd26Fc015446\",\n    \"operation\": 0,\n    \"value\": \"0\",\n    \"method\": \"setDelegate(bytes32 id, address delegate)\",\n    \"params\": [\n      \"0x70697374616368696f64616f2e65746800000000000000000000000000000000\",\n      \"0x8787FC2De4De95c53e5E3a4e5459247D9773ea52\"\n    ]\n  },\n  {\n    \"to\": \"0x469788fE6E9E9681C6ebF3bF78e7Fd26Fc015446\",\n    \"operation\": 0,\n    \"value\": \"0\",\n    \"method\": \"setDelegate(bytes32 id, address delegate)\",\n    \"params\": [\n      \"0x636f772e65746800000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000\",\n      \"0x8787FC2De4De95c53e5E3a4e5459247D9773ea52\"\n    ]\n  }\n]\n```\n\n## References\n- [Transaction payload](https://gist.github.com/FreeHeadSpace/a945e9e4901f998ad8d2bf3140a634f1)\n\n- [Tenderly Simulation](https://dashboard.tenderly.co/public/safe/safe-apps/simulator/30bd7a35-9c93-4d10-88f7-89dcb7ef6171)\n\n- [Forum Discussion](https://forum.gnosis.io/t/gip-87-should-gnosisdao-claim-its-vested-gel-allocation-and-delegate-it-along-with-cow-to-governance-safe-managed-by-karpatkey/6961)",

      "content": "Executive Summary\n\nGnosis DAO / Chain has decentralization as its core ethos, focusing on a distributed validator set for the chain and an open DAO structure run by GNO holders. Despite this, our Treasury has nearly all of its staked ETH assets sitting with LIDO as stETH. Given the success of RocketPool Protocol in creating a massively decentralized validator set through rETH and RPL, this proposal recommends that Gnosis DAO commit to moving at least 50% of their stETH holdings to rETH holdings over time in order to support Ethereum decentralization and reduce single protocol and “bad actor” risk that comes from Lido’s limited node set (29 nodes vs Rocket Pool’s 2550 and growing nodes).\nIntroduction\n\nAs of last notice, the Gnosis Treasury (managed by Karpatkey) holds 64,124 wstETH (~$130mm) and 5,725 stETH (~$10mm), 712 rETH (~$1.4mm), and 18,622 ETH. Full report here: 20230424 - karpatkey’s Weekly Report on GnosisDAO Farms.pdf - Google Drive 1 This concentrated holding of a centralized staking provider token is a risk to Gnosis DAO and against the DAO’s core ethos of decentralization. This GIP is intended to direct Karpatkey to move to reduce stETH dependency and introduce additional rETH into their DeFi strategies in order to reduce risk to the DAO and provide support to decentralized ethereum staking.\nProposed Changes\n\nThe Gnosis DAO will instruct Karpatkey to reduce stETH dependency and increase staked ETH diversity, but WILL NOT dictate how this is best accomplished. Karpatkey, once instructed, will move forward with whatever strategies are in the best interest of the DAO to reduce stETH exposure and provide additional usage of rETH / RocketPool",

      "title": "GIP-82: Should GnosisDAO co-fund a community owned forest / land art project (terra0)?",
      "content": "## Summary\nThis proposal seeks Gnosis DAO to become a sponsor and partner that would partially fund terra0 to support the development of a novel large-scale art project in Germany that focuses on community-land stewardship managed by a DAO. The project will expand the use cases of the Gnosis ecosystem by using Gnosis infrastructure (Safe, Gnosis Chain, Zodiac) to manage and restore a forest over an indefinite time period. The artistic development is being supported by Light Art Space (LAS), a German art foundation focused on art, science, and technology and will culminate in a large-scale exhibition in Berlin (3-6 months), allowing for a broad, diverse, and non-native audience to be exposed to Gnosis and Web3.\n\nIn parallel, terra0 will produce a legal framework allowing for the integration of a Gnosis Safe with the formation of a German Verein. As part of this proposal, terra0 will develop and provide tools to integrate Gnosis Safes with this framework and use the project to establish an inaugural precedent.\n\nterra0 seeks 195,000 € from Gnosis DAO to help realize this ambitious project (~ 18.2% of 1,071,000 € total project budget). The grant from Gnosis would help fund the purchase of a plot of land containing a forest in Germany and lay the groundwork for the legal framework and application of a DAO as a Verein for a Gnosis Safe. With this funding Gnosis DAO will:\n\nSponsor the terra0 land art project and be featured on exhibition material, resulting in increased publicity, visibility, and user base for Gnosis, Gnosis Chain, and Gnosis Safe within a new cultural sphere.\n\nSupport the development of a new legal framework for DAOs resulting in a composable template engine for Gnosis Safes which allows DAOs to be registered as a Verein in Germany, thereby creating new real-life applications for DAOs built on Gnosis tools.\n\nReceive an allocation of the tokens associated with the upcoming terra0 land art project and DAO. We also see Gnosis DAO as a key community member and participant in the project.\n\n## Background\nterra0 is a group of developers, artists, and researchers who have been creating artworks and prototyping decentralized applications since 2016. Through technical experimentation, artistic exploration, and stress-testing legal frameworks related to natural resources, terra0 creates technological-augmented ecosystems and questions the contemporary representation of the living environment. In this final version of the project, realized for the first time on the scale of an entire forest in Germany, terra0 will develop a framework for the collaborative management of shared resources and explore alternative, non-exploitative valuations of nature. terra0 plans to instantiate a DAO to cooperatively organize the restoration of the ecosystem using bio-markers oriented towards greater biodiversity and resistance to environmental pressures.\n\nPrevious terra0 works and prototypes can be seen on our website. They have been exhibited and discussed at the 58th Carnegie International, the 17th Architecture Biennial Venice, Canadian Centre for Architecture Montreal, The Shed New York City, Kunsthalle Zürich, Francisco Carolinum Linz, Chronus Art Center Shanghai, Furtherfield Gallery London, Schinkel Pavillon Berlin, and Vienna Biennale, among others.\n\n## Motivation\nIt’s no secret that we are in the midst of an ecological crisis spurred on, in large part, by excessive resource use and extraction. In the West, our relationship with the environment has been defined for centuries by land’s productive value, which has led to gross ecological mismanagement and destabilization. terra0 seeks to re-orient this relationship towards intrinsic ecological value by applying Web3 principles of decentralized collective governance, communal ownership of public goods, and automated digital mediation in service of environmental resilience and autonomy. The development of decentralized programmable systems for exchanging value is giving rise to code and community-based digital organizational structures that enable democratic control of property. Novel ecological collectives such as those proposed by terra0 could distribute decision rights based on immanent bio-regional agency, relationships, and proximal metrics.\n\n## Rationale\nAs a collective, terra0 has been experimenting for years with Gnosis Safe as infrastructure for treasury management and as a trust anchor. Historically, we see Gnosis Chain and community as a place where DAO experiments happen; one we believe provides essential DAO infrastructure for the projects, affordable txs, and a community that cares deeply about its development. Gnosis’ commitment to open standards whose design philosophy is one of expandability, inclusivity, and composability aligns with the terra0 ethos of experimenting with novel forms of governance and communities centered around ecological commons.\n\nThe proposed art project is of value to the Gnosis community as it engages a diverse audience and is participatory in nature — pairing ecological narratives with a concrete implementation of DAO governance. This includes visitors of the exhibition, online DAO members, local stakeholders, an international art audience, and experts from various fields. When combined with the timescale, exhibition, and participatory nature of the terra0 land art project, presents a unique opportunity to engage an audience that would not normally be accessible while increasing the capability and usage of the Gnosis ecosystem and Gnosis Chain. The land and forest will function as a permanent land art installation and be accompanied by an internationally recognized and large-scale public exhibition organized by LAS in Berlin over the period of 3-6 months — which may travel to other locations in the future. This connection has the potential to enhance the public perception of Gnosis: applied ecology and community governance have rarely been publicly discussed and tested on such a scale.\n\nAdditionally, the application and implementation of mapping a Verein onto a DAO will enhance how it can be perceived in a legal context — one we hope will set a precedent that will allow for its legality to be recognized in other locals, contexts, and jurisdictions while featuring Gnosis Chain and tools as key components. Although the legal definition and context of a Verein is unique to Germany, once incorporated, it allows for international members to join the organization — therefore not only being bound to the members residing in Germany (except seven core members). The possibility to integrate DAOs into a concrete legal structure using the Verein is an important building block for our project and enables real-world use cases in areas such as environmental protection and restoration.\n\n## Implementation\nThe land art project will be developed over the next year, in this process terra0 will purchase a plot of land containing a forest (10-20 hectares) in nearby proximity to Berlin, instantiate a DAO to augment the ecological agency of the ecosystem, and transfer the ownership of the land to it. The DAO governs the token systems, enforces the sovereignty of the underlying ecosystem, and mediates human oriented relations. The secondary function of the DAO is that of providing a social space, thus contributing to the stimulation of work groups and educational initiatives relating to ecology and technology. Many visitors and potential DAO participants will have little experience with blockchain and Web3 — and will interact and be exposed to Gnosis Chain and ecosystem for the first time. Through a special statute and voting mechanism of the association which locks the ownership in the DAO, it also serves as a permanent protector of the piece of land against disposal and reintegration into economic dependence and exploitation.\n\nDuring the production period and exhibition terra0 and LAS will host a series of workshops and events to on-board and orient the community into the DAO. Gnosis DAO will receive a proportional amount of tokens relative to the proposed funding to participate in the terra0 land art project — one that we see as a key member when engaging in a long-term project about the evolution of legal structures pertaining to DAOs and ecological management.\n\nThe exhibition component of the terra0 land art project will be exhibited with LAS. Previous exhibitions produced by LAS can be viewed here 1. In recent exhibitions, LAS received approximately 25 000 – 30 000 visitors for the duration, an average of 600-800 visitors a day. Additional coverage of 60 – 100 media outlets enabled the exhibition’s themes to be brought to the forefront of international discourse.\n\nFor the land art project to be successful, the DAO requires a legal structure to hold and administer property (land) according to German law. We are currently working with legal teams to define a Gnosis Safe as the managing tool for a Verein under German jurisdiction. This framework will allow for the fluid recognition of token holders (as addresses) to be viewed as legal members of an organization at the time of voting without any additional registration.\n\n####  Two aspects are to be particularly emphasized:\n1. The legal membership in the Verein will be defined only by a membership token, the associated address, and will not require the registration of identity through KYC (with the exception of seven registered members, which is a condition for each Verein in Germany).\n\n2. Votes which take place with the help of the associated voting methods (such as Governor mod) to be legally defined by the association rules as “continuous association meetings.”\n\nIf these two aspects are laid out in an association regulation, the Gnosis Safe can be legally integrated into a Verein without any additional infrastructure. The development period will be followed by an initial implementation and prototype of this legal structure that will be deployed as the framework for the DAO in conjunction with the land art project and exhibition.\n\nFollowing this, terra0 will create a web and Gnosis Safe app (this could take the form as something similar to KALI with increased functionality) with a DAO template engine that will allow and enable a DAO to be incorporated under German law as a Verein. The app will facilitate the deployment of a Gnosis Safe, create the legal documents required for the registration of the Verein under German law, and will use the Gnosis Safe and associated voting method.\n\n## Milestones & timeline\n### 2023\n- May–June: Completion of the legal framework and formation of the legal entity (= proof of concept [Payment #1 for the acquisition of the forest (175,000€) to the Verein]\n- June–July: Acquisition of the forest\n- June–March 2024: Technical development of the DAO structure, ecological survey, assemble advisory board, …\n- July–August: Development of the template engine for Gnosis safe [Payment #2 (20,000€) for the legal research and implementation of the template engine]\n\n### 2024\n- January–May: Community building\n- February–April: Exhibition building\n- April: Allocation of tokens to funding partners\n- May: Exhibition/DAO opening + NFT sale\n- May–June: Public program\n\n## Relevant links:\n\n#### Link to Gnosis Forum thread:\n- https://forum.gnosis.io/t/gip-82-should-gnosisdao-co-fund-a-community-owned-forest-land-art-project-terra0/6570\n\n#### Background information / press:\n- Website:  [terra0.org](https://terra0.org/)\n- Light Art Space:  [lightartspace.org](https://lightartspace.org/)\n- Budget:  [Gnosis Proposal Budget .xlsx](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1McYyWCZlCsCNXzaqsLBjVErt9gOdtGnv/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=101530439550121892891&rtpof=true&sd=true)\n- [Simon Denny & terra0 / outland.art](https://outland.art/simon-denny-terra0/)\n- [terra0’s Self-Governing Forests / frieze.com](https://www.frieze.com/article/terra0-profile-2023)\n- [This tree owns itself—and is fighting for its own survival / fastcompany.com ](https://www.fastcompany.com/90738287/this-tree-owns-itself-and-is-fighting-for-its-own-survival)\n \n![TERRAO-PIC-1024x683.jpg](ipfs://bafybeifplcv6x3dvrp3xlbbubao7qfuo5wgcga5kklfowtqdjovp72z5ue)\n    ",

      "title": "GIP-80: Should GnosisDAO fund p2panda's off-chain solution for secure group encryption?",
      "content": "Forum URL: https://forum.gnosis.io/t/gip-80-should-gnosisdao-fund-p2pandas-off-chain-solution-for-secure-group-encryption/6541\n\n## Category\n\nFunding - Rewards\n\n## Executive Summary\n\nHello Gnosis community!\n\nWe would like to realize a prototype for a decentralized, off-chain, encrypted group chat where Ethereum addresses can serve as the receiver's identifiers.\n\nTo achieve this we want to improve and build on top of the [Messaging Layer Security Protocol](https://messaginglayersecurity.rocks) (MLS) and the [p2panda](https://p2panda.org/) protocol. This technology fills a need in the Gnosis community for a generic and encrypted off-chain data layer.\n\nThis technology fills a need in the Gnosis community for a generic and encrypted off-chain data layer. The group chat will also be a proof of concept and template for future applications serving the Gnosis community using the same infrastructure.\n\n## Specification\n\n[p2panda](https://p2panda.org/) is a new protocol and ecosystem for building decentralised applications with authenticated and encrypted data which is automatically stored and synced between computers.\n\nSome of the building blocks of p2panda are a permission system, conflict-free replicated data types, multi-key identities, data schemas, multi-writer documents, local deletion, sparse replication, dynamic GraphQL queries, hybrid network topologies and more.\n\nWhile p2panda aims at being a low-barrier framework to enter the p2p space without worrying too much about the technical challenges coming with it, we also want to offer a toolbox to build radical applications which work locally, offline and both in the browser and on low-energy devices like a smartphone or embedded computer.\n\nData is encrypted with the help of the MLS protocol providing Double-Ratchet-based group encryption. MLS assures Post-Compromise Security (PCS) and Forward Secrecy (FS) and still stays performant for large groups. While MLS is capable of working in a decentralised environment it hasn't been explicitly specified for it. With p2panda we have all the building blocks to realize MLS in a fully decentralised setting.\n\nFor all of this to play nicely together, the following implementation steps are planned:\n\n### Secret Groups\n\n_Secret Groups_ is the data schema that p2panda uses to handle data encryption for groups in a decentralised setting and it builds on MLS as its underlying layer.\n\np2panda already contains a low-level API for MLS that we implemented as a precursor for the more high-level _Secret Groups_. This low-level API supports two basic usage scenarios: Double-Ratchet-based encryption (the MLS default) and a so called \"Long Term Secret\" encryption on top of that. The latter allows group members to still decrypt past data after entering the group, which is practical for building applications like Wikis. Double-Ratchet-based encryption offers Forward Secrecy instead (FS), which can be used for secure chat applications and other use cases where new group members should not access past data.\n\nThe next step will be building an elegant high-level API that makes this system easily accessible for developers that want to integrate _Secret Groups_ in their applications. This involves additions to our GraphQL API, p2panda's built-in data schemas and replication data format, which are all part of our core protocol specification.\n\n**Further Links**\n\n- \"OpenMLS\" MLS implementation in Rust which is used by p2panda: https://github.com/openmls/openmls\n- MLS integration in p2panda: https://github.com/p2panda/p2panda/tree/main/p2panda-rs/src/secret_group\n- Draft \"Secret Group\" specification in p2panda: https://p2panda.org/specification/encryption\n\n### Rust and TypeScript libraries\n\nDevelopers will use our Rust and TypeScript libraries to integrate p2panda in their applications.\n\nTo persist MLS group state we will implement interfaces for some known storage backends developers can choose from (SQL, IndexedDB, LocalStorage). To account for forks of diverging group state (due to network fragmentation) we need to extend our persistence system with an additional layer. This layer keeps past group states for a while to be able to decrypt messages from \"forked\" group states. This temporarily weakens Forward Secrecy the more fragmented the group state gets.\n\n**Further Links**\n\n- MLS specification (Version 9 February 2023) addressing forked group states: https://messaginglayersecurity.rocks/mls-protocol/draft-ietf-mls-protocol.html#section-14\n- OpenMLS Rust crate allowing handling past group epochs w. `max_past_epochs` option: https://openmls.tech/book/user_manual/group_config.html\n- Diagram: Handling concurrent updates in Secret Groups: https://whimsical.com/concurrent-updates-in-secret-groups-MZdGMKmMJ25zxrDAzuoXGG\n- `p2panda-rs` Rust crate: https://crates.io/crates/p2panda-rs\n- `p2panda-js` npm package: https://www.npmjs.com/package/p2panda-js\n\n### Key Groups\n\nThe MLS specification does not have a concept of \"moderators\" or \"administrators\" in a group. Theoretically all members of the group can mutate its state. p2panda _Key Groups_ are a permission layer on top of MLS which allows for decentralised permission handling of multi-writer data. Next to permissions they also enable multi-device identities.\n\nAs part of this effort we will create an implementation of our specification of the _Key Groups_ system, which will be able to model a permission system on top of any encrypted group.\n\n**Further Links**\n\n- Draft \"Key Group\" specification: https://p2panda.org/specification/authorisation\n\n### External Keys\n\np2panda uses Ed25519 as the Digital Signature Algorithm. To allow other DSAs we need to implement a _handshake_ process where external identity systems such as an Ethereum key can authorise an MLS group member. This will involve adding another data schema to p2panda.\n\n**Further Links**\n\n- Diagram: External keys in p2panda: https://whimsical.com/digital-signature-algorithms-EgAkzR7mVDj4BQb7xySahh\n- Schema specification: https://p2panda.org/specification/data-types/schemas#system-and-application-schemas\n\n### POC: Group chat in Circles client\n\nAs a proof-of-concept (POC) we will integrate p2panda with MLS into an existing Ethereum application in the Gnosis community. Since our team partly consists of the original developers of the Circles ecosystem we want to use the current Circles web client to show how Ethereum addresses (Gnosis Safe contracts) can be used as receiver addresses for an encrypted MLS chat group.\n\n* Users can associate their Gnosis Safe address (\"Circles profile\") with a p2panda key\n* Users can create and manage groups to communicate with a set of other Safe addresses\n* Users can access their chats from all of their devices simultaneously\n\n**Further Links**\n\n- Circles website: https://joincircles.net/\n- Circles client: https://circles.garden/\n\n### Security Audit\n\nThe OpenMLS team which partly consists of the IETF standard editors consulted us already with the correct integration of MLS into p2panda. We will continue with this collaboration. To verify our work and gather feedback we want to work with Least Authority for a security audit. \n\n- OpenMLS: https://openmls.tech/\n- Least Authority: https://leastauthority.com/\n\n## Rationale\n\nScaleable data encryption for large groups in a decentralised network is hard and has always involved a trade-off between UX and security. We believe that MLS is the first [Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) standard](https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/mls/about/) to tackle some of these challenges. p2p applications of all kinds, for example the Gnosis Safe Apps, will benefit from an off-chain protocol that gives them a distributed, strongly encrypted database stack.\n\nOne goal of p2panda's protocol design has been enabling both usage from native apps, independent of a stable connection to the internet, and immediate access from a plain web browser, without having to install any additional software. Additionally, p2panda keeps data portable instead of locking it to a specific application or server. Our design works in both federated network topologies and fully decentralised systems, both of which can be configured depending on the needs of the software and the communities that are operating it.\n\nEthereum addresses (EOA and Contract account, for example of a Gnosis Safe) are ideal identifiers for applications like a distributed messaging platform. They are already established in the community, simplify onboarding and enable cross-validation of identities through previous usage of those keys. Protocols with centralised registries like PGP/GPG failed here and we believe that Ethereum addresses that are native to decentralised networks are much more suitable for this task. We want to enable any holder of an Ethereum key to bring their identity and access additional tools for the community.\n\n## Budget\n\n- 172.800 DAI - Salary for 3x half-time developers over ~12 months (8h / day, 3 days / week, 48 weeks, 50 DAI / hour)\n- 10.000 DAI - Security Audit Fee\n- 5.000 DAI - Administration\n- 12.200 DAI - Contingency\n\nTotal: 200.000 DAI\n\n## Milestones\n\n**Proposed timeline:** 12 months\n\n**Final goal:** Implementation and realisation of specified items (see \"Specification\" above)\n\n**Timeline and Success metrics**\n\n- Phase 1 - Research & Specification\n  Success Metrics - Publicly published Secret Group, Key Group and External Keys specification on p2panda.org website and GitHub repository\n  Time and Price Estimate - 2 month, 28.800 DAI\n- Phase 2 - Implementation Secret Groups\n  Success Metrics - `p2panda-js` package release on npm with Secret Group encryption API and storage provider API\n  Time and Price Estimate - 3 months, 43.200 DAI\n- Phase 3 - Implementation Key Groups\n  Success Metrics - `p2panda-rs` crate release on crates.io with Key Group data types. `aquadoggo` node implementation release on crates.io handling key groups in materialization logic\n  Time and Price Estimate - 3 months, 43.200 DAI\n- Phase 4 - Implementation External Keys\n  Success Metrics - Package release on npm (either `p2panda-js` or external package) with External Keys feature\n  Time and Price Estimate - 1 month 14.400 DAI\n- Phase 5 - POC: Circles Chat\n  Success Metrics - Release of encrypted Group-Chat in Circles Wallet (either in official circles.garden Website or fork)\n  Time and Price Estimate - 1 month 14.400 DAI\n- Phase 6 - Security Audit\n  Success Metrics - Shared results of audit in p2panda GitHub repository, report on required refactorings / changes in codebase\n  Time and Price Estimate - 1 month 10.000 DAI (audit) + 14.400 DAI (development)\n- Phase 7 - Documentation + Tutorials\n  Success Metrics - Published tutorials on how to use Secret Groups, Key Groups and External Keys feature on p2panda.org website\n  Time and Price Estimate - 1 month 14.400 DAI\n\n## Evaluation\n\nA security audit and implementation of a POC in a widely-used context like Circles will evaluate the success of this undertaking.\n\n## Team & Organisation \n\np2panda is a not-for-profit organisation founded in 2021 with the mission to bring an easy to use but radical p2p stack to app developers. We received the NGI Pointer grant in 2021/22 and NGI Assure in 2022/23.\n\nThe team behind p2panda are experts in p2p, Rust and TypeScript development. The founding members are:\n- [adz](https://github.com/adzialocha/) has been the core developer next to [isthisa](https://isthisa.com/) developing the first version of the Circles UBI community currency, both of them founded later the [bitspossessed](https://github.com/bitspossessed/) developer collective which still maintains the Circles project\n- [sandreae](https://github.com/sandreae) is a Rust developer with experience across the landscape of offline-first protocols\n- [cafca](https://github.com/cafca) is part of the [Decent Patterns](https://decentpatterns.com/) library team, currently working on the JavaScript SDK of ditto\n\n## Conclusion\n\nSecure encryption for large groups is a complex problem which gets even harder in a decentralised setting. With the new [Messaging Layer Security Protocol](https://messaginglayersecurity.rocks) (MLS) and [p2panda](https://p2panda.org) as the decentralisation layer we want to introduce a solution that can account for a range of community-, threat- and networking models. At the same time we want to provide accessible and well-documented APIs for developers to easily build their solutions on top.",

      "content": "https://forum.gnosis.io/t/gip-83-should-gnosisdao-fund-decentralized-alternatives-of-gnosis-chain-pruned-and-archival-rpc-endpoints-from-pocket-network-for-18-months \n\nService Agreement for Decentralized RPC Access of Gnosis Chain through the Pocket Network protocol\n\nCategory\n\nService Agreements - Decentralized Gnosis Chain Public RPCs powered by Pocket Network\n\nExecutive Summary\n\nPocket Network is a decentralized, middleware protocol focused on the RPC layer. Its goal is to provide blockchain application developers with a privacy-preserving, multi-chain gateway on top of the Pocket Network protocol that allows dapp developers to mint reliable, fast RPC endpoints for the 40+ blockchain networks supported, including both Gnosis Chain pruned and Gnosis Chain archival.\n\nFor example, over the last month, Gnosis Chain has carved the number 3 spot in terms of requests per day at ~130.6M daily average requests through Pocket Network according to POKTscan!\n\nAfter speaking with stakeholders on both sides of the aisle, Pocket Network Inc has been encouraged to publish this new Gnosis Improvement Proposal without the retroactive funding aspect. The previous years of service are a gift to the Gnosis community of users, developers, applications, and protocols. Thank you for the opportunity to demonstrate Pocket Network’s value proposition as the most redundant, reliable, multi-chain RPC layer by taking on additional traffic during Dark Forest rounds and the xDAI to Gnosis Chain transition (to name a few past examples).\n\nGnosis and Pocket stakeholders favor an 18-month service contract to fund continued access to decentralized RPC alternatives for both Gnosis Chain pruned and Gnosis Chain archival. It will allow GnosisDAO to steward this public good together with Pocket Network!\n\nBy funding a pokt-powered Public Gnosis Chain RPC endpoint, GnosisDAO and Pocket Network would continue to contribute to the decentralization, increased resiliency, and censorship-resistance of the Gnosis Chain network. All the while, continuing to incentivize Gnosis Chain node runners with $POKT tokens for serving Gnosis dapps.\n\nService Description\n\nPocket Network Inc. staked POKT on behalf of the GnosisDAO to subsidize a public good in the form of public RPC endpoints (available in the Gnosis Chain docs) without rate limits:\n\n1. https://gnosischain-rpc.gateway.pokt.network/\n2. https://gnosischain-archival-rpc.gateway.pokt.network/\n\nThe current set of Gnosis Relay Chain IDs (RCIs) Pocket Network supports are:\n\n1. Gnosis Chain pruned = 0027 (mainnet)\n2. Gnosis Chain archival = 000C (mainnet)\n\nThe POKTdao allowlisted Gnosis Chain (0027) on 07/06/21, with Gnosis Chain Archival (000C) shortly after on 08/26/21).\n\nSince the allowlist date, Pocket node operators earned 55.6M POKT from servicing over 38.9B Gnosis Chain mainnet read/write requests. See this spreadsheet for a breakdown of relays drive and POKT earned.\n\nOver that time, these Gnosis RCIs developed to become one of the more populated, stable, and higher-performant pools of nodes. Pocket’s network of node runners easily handled several spikes, including a big spike to 243.6M requests on a single day recently in JAN 2023.\n\nOver the last year or so, Pocket Network has been serving 100M+ requests per day with an excellent average response time of ~150ms with success rates above 99% across all Pocket Portal regions. Moreso, in the Asia-Pacific region (most used region by Gnosis) the response times are as low as 40ms (lower = better & faster).\n \n![gip83 regions.png](ipfs://bafkreiff3yj5qgk2fk36gikhd33ep5rwmix2e2qipdw7eugx57wdnv3nm4)\n    \nAccording to POKTscan, there are currently 20,596 Pocket Service Nodes pointing to Gnosis Full Nodes for the 0027 Relay Chain ID and 2,695 Pocket Service Nodes pointing to Gnosis Archive Nodes for the 000C Relay Chain ID.\n\nThis demonstrates the POKT node incentives at work!\n\nThe POKTdao has also supported node deployment solutions through funding grants such as Node Pilot and DappNode to make it super easy to spin up and monetize Gnosis full/archival nodes within the Pocket Network protocol.\n\nService Scope and Service Delivery\n\nPocket Network agrees to these milestones and deliverables:\n \n![gip83 milestones and deliverables.PNG](ipfs://bafkreiepfbfuhoyabcev64xp65pgiwo6v5th5f5hsctijf276xwl53mlbq)\n    \nSupport\n\nThe GnosisDAO will be able to monitor and manage the public RPCs through our Pocket Portal as they see fit, including the ability to enable additional security features such as allowlisting user-agents, origins, smart contracts, and methods.\n \n![gip83 portal security settings.png](ipfs://bafkreie2bbe6fiz6ykrjppbgac2sfwyznna53svdjf2rrmg764cn5n54km)\n    \nThe GnosisDAO and Gnosis Chain users are able to submit support tickets through this link.\n\nPricing and Payment\n\nPocket Network has simplified their model this year to mirror a traditional SaaS-like tiered structure, which is much more affordable. To sweeten the deal, Pocket is offering the Gnosis DAO team and community a massive discount on a 150M requests per day at $0.0000020 throughput an 18-month commitment with the option to renew:\n\n$164,250 USD for 150M Requests Per Day on a 18-month contract\n\nThat represents 3.65x in yearly savings (a 365% discount) compared to the original offer!\n\nPayment Schedule\t\nPayment Dates\tAmount Due\nUpon Proposal Passing (50%) = $82,125 USD\nUpon Milestone Completion (50%) = $82,125 USD\nTotal (100%) = $164,250 USD\n\nPNI prefers payment in stablecoins, such as USDC or DAI, at this provided address from Pocket Network, Inc. → 0x5F1Feefc4BB7a414096cCF070BeEF94da8Ff88A6\n\nIn case a buffer is wanted/needed, as traffic continues to grow, PNI would like to extend another option to purchase additional bandwidth at the discounted price of $0.0000018640 per request throughout the contract period.\n\nIf Pocket Network Inc is unsuccessful in their proposal to secure funding, PNI will continue to support the Gnosis Chain network; however, in an effort to do so sustainably, PNI would introduce per-second rate limits on the Public RPC that would channel users and developers to a paid tier in the Pocket Portal where costs would be passed on directly to Gnosis builders/users outside the free tier of 250k requests per day.\n\nService Terms and Exit Strategy\n\nContact the sales team at Pocket Network, Inc.\n\nTeam/Organization\n\nPocket Network, Inc.\n\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/company/pocket-network/\nhttps://twitter.com/POKTnetwork\n\nConclusion\n\nA decentralized RPC protocol is crucial for a blockchain that values decentralization such as Gnosis Chain.\n\nPublic RPCs are a public good, Pocket Network hopes to share in the responsibility together with the GnosisDAO of maintaining these high-quality public goods on behalf of Gnosis Chain users. The Pocket Network team and community have been a long-time supporters of the Gnosis Chain.\n\nWe’re proud to continue supporting Gnosis!",

      "content": "Summary\nThis proposal aims to trigger the Gnosis DAO safe to claim the fully vested GEL token from Gelato and delegate the voting power to the treasury safe that is managed by Karpatkey following GIP 58.\n\nMotivation\nFollowing Gelato's community vote on accelerating the GEL vesting, GEL tokens are fully vested to the Gnosis DAO since the 27th of February 2023. However, these tokens are not being put to use in the Gnosis ecosystem. By enabling the Gnosis DAO to claim the vested GEL tokens and delegate their voting power to the managed DAO treasury safe, we can ensure that these tokens are being used to shape the future of Gelato. Since GIP 20, Karpatkey DAO has managed the funds of the Gnosis DAO treasury. This was later extended through GIP 58. Through their strong relation with Gnosis DAO, Karpatkey DAO can actively manage the voting power of GEL to benefit the Gnosis DAO.\nThe complete amount vested to Gnosis DAO is 5,258,625 GEL.\nThe GEL tokens are not intended to be sold.\n\nSpecification\nThe proposal includes the following steps:\n\n(1) Claim first batch of vested GEL token: 2,629,312 GEL\n(2) Claim second batch of vested GEL token: 2,629,312 GEL\n(3) Delegate the voting power on Snapshot to eth:0x849D52316331967b6fF1198e5E32A0eB168D039d\n\nImplementation\nThis snapshot vote, if successful, should trigger two claims on https://gov.gelato.network/gel-claim and then delegate the voting power on snapshot to eth:0x849D52316331967b6fF1198e5E32A0eB168D039d, the actively managed treasury safe of the Gnosis DAO. \n\n\nReferences\n\nhttps://forum.gnosis.io/t/gip-20-karpatkey-dao-treasury-management/2233\n\nhttps://forum.gnosis.io/t/gip-58-karpatkey-dao-service-extension/5417\n\nhttps://snapshot.org/#/gelato.eth/proposal/0x29d610276f933a291c158d212b6c55b2e719173a4490b54769e31cb8054a8513\n",

      "title": "GIP-72: Should GnosisDAO fund Common Ground to support onboarding DAOs to the Gnosis Chain Ecosystem?",
      "content": "## Simple Summary\nThis proposal would fund [Common Ground](https://www.commonground.cg/), the all-in-one communication & governance platform for DAOs & Communities. Built as a public good, Common Ground supports the onboarding of DAOs and web3 communities to the Gnosis Chain ecosystem.\n\n## Abstract\nIn May 2022, Common Ground launched a closed alpha that onboarded over 90 communities by now including MetaCartel Ventures DAO, Radicle, Giveth, and Outlier Ventures. These communities selected us to provide their members with a more secure, web3 native communication and coordination platform. \n\nWe are uniquely positioned to introduce DAOs and web3 communities to the Gnosis Chain ecosystem. Our current and future features like token-gating, on-chain governance voting, and token issuance act as entry points for the Gnosis Chain ecosystem. We recently bridged our Governance Token to Gnosis Chain to reduce transaction costs and improve speed. In the coming months, we plan to launch a public beta of our badge system that could be a great introduction to a more formal Gnosis Chain integration on Common Ground.\n\nTest the closed alpha yourself with [this referral link](https://app.commonground.cg/?ref=gnosis)\nCommon Ground will enter public alpha soon™\n\nWe are seeking a USD 50,000 grant from GnosisDAO to further support onboarding DAOs and web3 communities to Gnosis Chain by making it the default EVM in all our web3 tooling features. Our goal is to establish trust and build our track record with GnosisDAO to explore larger opportunities in the future.\n\n## Motivation/Rationale\nEvery web3 community relies on communication and coordination to accomplish its goals in a decentralized manner. The core of these activities occur on web2 platforms that are not designed for web3 use cases. \n\nWe built Common Ground to address three core communication and coordination pain points that web3 communities face:\n\n* Web3 native: Our platform is built for web3 communities and their members. We plan to integrate WalletConnect into our platform so communities can implement features like token-gating, on-chain governance votes, token issuances, and airdrops. Members can craft their profiles by connecting multiple wallets, showcasing their NFT collection, and building their on-chain reputations. \n\n* Security: Community and user safety is one of the top priorities for our platform. We introduced core features like token-gating so communities don’t need to install bots and third-party apps. We also introduced the concept of “human-gating” which allows communities to restrict read or write-access to channels to verified humans. Users may opt to verify as a human through our partnership with Fractal. This functionality unlocks our ability to develop a full-grown Web of Trust that ensures the integrity of all social interaction on our platform and can be utilized by other projects in the Gnosis ecosystem.\n\n* Onboarding: Communities thrive when they have a frictionless, user-friendly onboarding experience. We built our own content management system to allow communities to create content flows catered to onboarding, announcements, and more. Current and prospective members can easily read the latest announcement as well as in-depth articles, learn more about the community, and rapidly onboard without searching across multiple platforms for information. \n\nThese core features are why web3 communities love our platform and will use our platform for on-chain activities like token issuance, governance voting, and airdrops. Our comprehensive communication and coordination platform stands to introduce communities to Gnosis Chain, Safe, and the broader Gnosis ecosystem. \n\n### **How Common Ground Onboards DAOs to Gnosis Chain Ecosystem**\nCommon Ground creates multiple opportunities to drive awareness and onboard communities to the Gnosis Chain ecosystem. Currently, our governance token and token-gating feature introduce communities and users to Gnosis Chain. In the future, our on-chain governance voting, token issuance, and more will drive communities directly to Gnosis Chain. \n\nCurrently, a major part of the liquid supply of our governance and fee tokens is maintained on Gnosis Chain. We are also already issuing our community governance NFTs on Gnosis Chain. As we continue to develop our platform and require it for many on-chain transactions, communities and their members will discover Gnosis Chain. This serves as one of the earliest touch points into the Gnosis ecosystem. \n\nIn the future, these are three of the major paths we envision that will onboard communities and DAOs into the Gnosis Chain ecosystem.\n\n#### Web3 Communities\nCommunities are the precursor for many successful DAOs. As more and more communities explore the power of web3 and DAOs, they will look for guidance and tooling that frictionlessly onboard them. We’re building Common Ground with this major use case in mind by developing tooling for companies to easily launch a governance token, implement on-chain voting, and handle mass airdrops to existing members. \n\nCommon Ground is positioned to be the trusted source to transition communities into DAOs as the communication and coordination layer for them. In all our tooling, we can place Gnosis Chain as the default EVM that will drive awareness and adoption of Gnosis Chain. Our communities will appreciate the low transaction fees, high speeds, and safe bridging onto Gnosis Chain. This will likely motivate them to explore the Gnosis ecosystem further.\n\n#### Existing DAOs\nCommon Ground addresses some of the core pain points that growing DAOs experience – onboarding, on-chain governance voting, and security. These features attracted our core user base for our closed alpha and contribute to consistent applications for our closed alpha. As DAOs continue to adopt our platform, we have the opportunity to introduce and onboard them to Gnosis Chain. \n\nDAOs strive for on-chain governance but hesitate due to Mainnet transaction costs. Our future governance feature allows DAOs to streamline on-chain voting and improve engagement while reducing transaction costs by leveraging secondary chains. This is one of the key areas where we can onboard DAOs into the Gnosis Chain ecosystem. We can place Gnosis Chain as the default EVM to make use seamless. \n\nCommon Ground serves as an onboarding platform for the Gnosis Chain Ecosystem. Our tooling introduces and onboards communities and DAOs seamlessly. We have the ability to raise awareness and grow the DAO community on Gnosis Chain.\n\n#### Web2 Communities & Users\nThere are hundreds of thousands of communities that may investigate more formal governance and DAO structures in the future. We want to make onboarding these communities seamless by developing a knowledge repository about web3 that features helpful articles, how-to videos, and more. \n\nCommon Ground would feature Gnosis Chain as the default chain in its educational articles and how-to videos. This would introduce communities to the Gnosis ecosystem to drive the adoption of Gnosis Chain, Safe, and more.\n\n## Specification\nCommon Ground will deliver governance and token issuance features to support onboarding communities and DAOs onto Gnosis Chain. We will place Gnosis Chain as the default EVM for each of these features.\n\n#### Deliverable #1: Integrated Governance Features\n\n* Expected Completion Date: Mid Q1 2023\n* Estimated Budget: $25,000\n* Features:\n  * On and Off-chain voting with native UI\n  * Polls and temperature check tooling\n  * Multiple voting systems (e.g. single choice, approval voting, quadratic voting)\n  * Discussion tools for the governance proposal process\n  * Snapshot integration\n  * Chain picker with Gnosis as the default chain\n  * Documentation with text and video tutorials\n\n#### Deliverable 2: Integrated Token Issuance\n\n* Expected Completion Date: End of Q1 2023\n* Estimated budget: $25,000\n* Features:\n  * Native UI\n  * Default smart contracts for the most common token standards (e.g. ERC20, ERC721, ERC1155)\n  * Integration of best practice solutions for the most common token features (e.g. vesting, time-locking, liquidity providing, etc)\n  * Chain picker with Gnosis as the default chain\n  * Documentation with text and video tutorials\n\n## Fund Dispersal\nThe funds will be managed and deployed by the Common Ground DAO multi-sig wallet. The signers on the wallet are the board members of the Common Ground Association as well as trusted core team members. Leftover funds will be deployed towards general improvements of the overall platform in terms of security, scalability and useability.",

      "content": "Chiado testnet is an important new part of the Gnosis ecosystem as a developer testnet. A reliable explorer is required for developers to be productive on Gnosis. A Blockscout instance should be set up as soon as possible to support Chiado now and into the future. This instance will rely on a dedicated node supported by Gateway. Gateway is already working with Chiado and can quickly spin up and support the required node infrastructure and RPC endpoint.\n\nTo expedite the process, which is necessary as the merge is coming very quickly, we are proceeding directly to phase 2. In case this proposal is supported by Gnosis community, Blockscout team is ready to prioritize this integration, and will try to launch the instance within one month after passing the proposal. We’ll plan for minimal branding based on the current Gnosis Chain explorer with monochrome colors to differentiate Chiado. The instance will be hosted at https://blockscout.com/gnosis/chiado 4.\n\nAs detailed in GIP-54 1, costs for hosting additional instances are $50,000 annually and cover high-capacity bandwidth, infrastructure upgrades, and data storage for the network. Feature enhancements and priority support are also included.\n\nPayment should be made to BlockScout’s Ethereum mainnet 0xAddress 0x242ba6d68FfEb4a098B591B32d370F973FF882B7 in $BOB tokens.",

      "content": "https://forum.gnosis.io/t/gip-69-should-gnosis-partner-with-daohaus-to-support-dao-tooling-on-gnosis-chain/5970\n\nSummary\nDAOhaus wants to deepen its partnership with GnosisDAO and is requesting $300k USD equivalent in stablecoins or GNO to the DAOhaus Core Contributor DAO, WarCamp.\n\nAbstract/Description\nDAOhaus provides purpose driven communities on Gnosis Chain with an open and free to use no-code platform for launching and managing their Moloch DAOs.\n\nBased on our activity on Gnosis Chain and previous collaborations with Gnosis, DAOhaus is interested in deepening the partnership between GnosisDAO and DAOhaus by supporting initiatives to drive more activity and communities to the Gnosis Chain ecosystem.\n\nOur goals around making DAO tooling more accessible and composable for both users and developers aligns with Gnosis’ goals to attract more users and developers to the Gnosis Chain ecosystem.\n\nWe believe Gnosis Chain enhances the cultural relevance of the Ethereum ecosystem and is comparable in cultural legitimacy to Mainnet. DAOhaus is thrilled to support and be supported by Gnosis Chain.\n\nMotivation/Rationale\nWe have been referring to Gnosis Chain as the “DAO Chain” for the better part of a year, and it is safe to say that DAOhaus calls Gnosis Chain home.\n\nWe are proud contributors to the Gnosis Chain Weekly newsletter, producing a DAO of the Week 1 piece each week and the Zodiac DAO wiki as early and ongoing contributors of DAO success patterns.\n\nAll of our core operations take place on Gnosis Chain and DAOhaus has provided DAOs on Gnosis Chain with excellent tooling, bug maintenance, support and a seamless UX - thanks to Gnosis’ high tx throughput & low costs.\n\nDAOhaus provides pertinent subgraph infrastructure to the Gnosis Chain ecosystem, where the daohaus-xdai subgraphs [1] [2] [3] have around ~700k queries per day with no server or IP querying more than ~40k on a given day, resulting in a fairly wide distribution of DAOhaus subgraph queries!\n\nSince 2020, DAOhaus users have created 1k+ DAOs on Gnosis Chain, onboarded 10k+ unique DAO members, submitted 40k+ proposals, and launched 700+ Gnosis Safes through the DAOhaus app. [1] [2] [3]\n\nAs of 2021, DAOhaus DAOs have had approximately $400M in total value flow through the platform.\n\nA stablecoin or GNO grant from Gnosis DAO would increase our capacity to build more valuable tools for DAOs and ultimately bring more DAOs, users, devs, and talent into the Gnosis Chain ecosystem.\n\nIf passed, DAOhaus and Gnosis will enter into a positive and mutually reinforcing collaboration that will sustain growth across the Gnosis Chain ecosystem for years to come.\n\nSpecification\nGrant funds will be allocated to three primary areas of focus, each of which supports our larger objective to bring community-first coordination tools to more human networks.\n\nDeliverables and Activities\n1. New DAO deployment tools\nDevelopment of a Safe Summoner App - enabling multisigs to easily level up into DAOhaus v3 DAOs\nDevelopment of apps/tools for migrating from DAOhaus v2 to DAOhaus v3\n2. Educational content for DAO users & operators\nCreate docs, explainers, and tutorials for new and experienced DAO users & operators\nFocus on common governance patterns, best practices, migration paths and more.\n3. Developer advocacy, outreach, and support\nTo be executed by the DAOhaus developer relations (DevRel) working group\n\nEncourage use of the DAOhaus v3 libraries by external development teams\nProvide active integration support & guidance to Gnosis ecosystem developers\nInform and execute further development of DAOhaus v3 libraries based on developer community needs\nFund developer grants, bounties, and/or hackathon prizes\nOverview\nEach of the above initiatives will support our goal of onboarding 100 new DAOs to Gnosis Chain by Q2 2023. Additionally, these activities will have the following positive impact for Gnosis:\n\nProvide Gnosis Safe users additional community-oriented options for governing their assets and network\nProvide additional paths for developers to build on Gnosis Chain and Zodiac\nIncrease support for developers on Gnosis Chain\nTeam\nThis work will be conducted by Warcamp, the DAO of core contributors to DAOhaus.\n\nThis table represents the current team assembled for executing on the deliverables outlined above. Personnel changes are quick on our team and can be expected in the coming months. We offer this as a soft guideline for how we are thinking about work distribution.\n\nContributor\tPrimary Role\n01000011 2\tContent / UX\nadrienne 1\tDesigner\nAmos 1\tDevRel\nAvi 1\tDesigner / UX\nBau 1\tContent\nBrian 1\tDeveloper\nChristina 1\tContent\nearth2travis 1\tProject Manager\nDekan Brown 1\tDeveloper\nJord 1\tDeveloper\nJP 1\tProject Manager\nJeremy 2\tTester\nKeating 1\tDeveloper\nPlor 1\tProject Manager\nSantiago 1\tDeveloper\nSam Kuhlmann 1\tDeveloper\nScott 2\tDeveloper\nSpencer 2\tProduct Manager / PR\nTW 1\tDocumenter\nUI369 1\tDevRel\nFund Dispersal\nTo fund the development of the above, DAOhaus is requesting stablecoins or GNO directly to it’s core contributor compensation vault (a Safe Minion): gno:0x9Fa12b5507B43229cB5bf96A056fE77E50aA99c9.\n\nWe appreciate any feedback or support you can provide on our proposal, please feel free to leave comments in the doc or drop your feedback below!",

      "title": "GIP-67: Should GnosisDAO fund Gnosis (chain) Ecosystem Analysis and Dashboard?",
      "content": "Simple Summary\nTo create an in-depth Ecosystem Report and Live Ecosystem Dashboard that helps attract new resources to Gnosis and improve resource coordination among existing stakeholders.\n\nAbstract\nTo improve resource coordination and allocation within the Gnosis ecosystem, GnosisDAO should fund the creation of a curated overview and ecosystem dashboard. This will improve navigation of the Gnosis ecosystem and fast-track decision-making (such as investments, grants, partnerships, business development, and more). A curated Gnosis overview based on an in-depth analysis of its key players will strongly improve the UX and navigation of projects building on the Gnosis chain.\n\nMotivation\nThe Gnosis ecosystem evaluation and dashboard aim to improve UX for new joiners and longstanding contributors. It will speed up decision-making and coordination by improving the navigation of the space through a curated ecosystem overview. This will also enable new features, such as sorting all projects by a rating score. Thus users can easily find projects that fulfill their needs and match their level of interest or risk appetite.\n\nMaking it easier for Gnosis stakeholders to understand and navigate all projects on Gnosis will save a lot of time and resources related to due diligence and decision-making.\n\nThe report and dashboard can also be used as a starting point for a potential GnosisDAO Ecosystem Fund or any other Grants/Builder program. Moreover, it can be used as a benchmark to follow the developments and improvements and uncover gaps.\n\nSpecification\nThe program will start with an ecosystem mapping and methodology improvement facilitated by two top-raters of Prime Rating (rank Master 1 or higher). An updated version of the current review framework will be made to match the Gnosis context, and a list of all projects on Gnosis with research priorities will be created.\n\nAfter the pre-research, the Prime Rating team will host two seasons (rating contests) in collaboration with Gnosis community members to evaluate at least 40+ projects on Gnosis. During these events, analysts can get rewarded with DAI, GNO, and D2D for reviewing the Gnosis ecosystem.\n\nFrom this research, two resources will be created, namely:\n\nAn Ecosystem Report - An easily digestible report that showcases the existing ecosystem (from tech to projects built on the Gnosis chain and identifies potential areas for improvement to expand the ecosystem). The report can be used by users, builders, and funders alike to speed up their decision-making.\n\nThe Gnosis Dashboard - A web application that provides an overview of all projects on Gnosis that can be reviewed using our methodologies with a letter score based on a proven methodology, analyzing the quality of key attributes of each project (including team, governance, tokenomics, value-proposition and more). The Dashboard will be tailored to Gnosis and hosted on a Gnosis-native domain. An example of a dashboard can be found here 3.\n\nReview Methodology and Process\nThe project will be executed by Prime Rating, an analyst collective with over 50+ contributors that operates as an independent sub-DAO of PrimeDAO. Since early 2021, Prime Rating has created multiple frameworks to evaluate projects and ecosystems with over 200+ reports created by 60+ individuals and successful projects executed with Celo, 1kx, Kyber, and Metaportal. It has a partnership with leading research group DeFi Safety which provides the technical review, whereby Prime Rating focuses primarily on the fundamental side.\n\nPrime Rating operates as a DAO - where reports are created by analysts and reviewed by experienced DAO members in a Web 3.0 native way - allowing for native ecosystem members to learn, level up, and earn rewards. Analysts in Prime Rating earn a rank by successfully submitting reports accepted via governance, which is manifested as on-chain reputation, thus representing their experience.\nThe current review framework includes DeFi, Metaverse, and ReFi and provides deep insights into the reviewed projects. This is then translated into a letter score, representing the overall quality of a project.\n\nImplementation\nTimeline and Budget\n\nWithin 4 weeks of this proposal passing, the top raters of Prime Rating (rank Master or higher) will create an ecosystem map to ensure a clear overview of the current Gnosis ecosystem. Based on this preliminary research, an updated version of the current review framework will be made to match the Gnosis context, and a list of all projects on Gnosis with research priorities will be created.\nWithin 12 weeks of the completion of the pre-research, the Prime Rating team will host two seasons (each 5-week long rating contests) with existing raters and Gnosis community members to analyze at least 40+ projects building on Gnosis. During these events, analysts can get rewarded with DAI, GNO, and D2D for reviewing the Gnosis Ecosystem.\nWithin 4 weeks of the completion of the events, the Prime Rating team will create a live dashboard similar to the current Rating Dashboard 3 to be hosted on a Gnosis native domain such as ecosystem.gnosis.io 2\nWithin 6 weeks of the completion of the rate-athons, the top raters will create, design, and publish an ecosystem report with key insights gained during reviewing the projects.\n\nGnosisDAO will provide 58,500 DAI + 400 GNO to Prime Rating to run the full program within 18 weeks of this proposal passing. Received funds to be managed by the Prime Rating multisig at primerating.eth. Rewards to be allocated on Gnosis Chain.\n\nFund Allocation Details\nBelow is a breakdown of the expected spending of the budget based on previous campaigns.\n\nPreliminary research phase: 8,000 DAI + 40 GNO for three weeks of research by two top raters.\nRating Season: 15,500 DAI + 200 GNO to be distributed to analysts and reviewers (expected to be split between 15+ individuals)\nEcosystem Report: 10,000 DAI + 60 GNO for four weeks of research by two high-level raters\nDashboard: 7,500 DAI + 25 GNO to design, develop and host the Ecosystem Dashboard on a Gnosis native domain.\nProgram Management: 12,500 DAI + 75 GNO for 5 weeks of program management\nMarketing: 5,000 DAI to support marketing and design efforts and purchase media to support the rate-athon and report.\nTotal: 58,500 DAI + 400 GNO\n\nAll rewards will be allocated on Gnosis Chain to promote usage.",

To support this objective, we suggest distributing the SAFE tokens as additional yield to those participating in staking on the Gnosis Beacon Chain.\n\nWe suggest the following distribution:\n\n- Equal distribution of vested SAFE tokens to GNO holders on a monthly basis until the end of the locking period (February 15, 2023, about 0.9% of all SAFE tokens).\n- Eligible GNO:\n- GNO in locking contracts on Ethereum and Gnosis Chain.\n- GNO used by individual stakers.\n- GNO/sGNO used in the curve pool GNO:sGNO 19\n- After the end of the locking period:\nUse up to 9.1% of the remaining SAFE tokens as additional yield for stakers on the Gnosis Beacon Chain over the remaining vesting period. The distribution should be based on the importance of the different staking categories:\n- individual stakers (e.g. dappnode users)\n- distributed liquid staking (e.g. rocket pool users)\n- professional staking services (e.g. chorus.one)\nliquid staking (e.g. stakewise, lido))",

      "title": "GIP-63: Should GnosisDAO award a Grant to Algovera to develop a DAO framework for Decentralized AI Teams?",
      "content": "Simple Summary\nAlgovera is requesting a grant of $50,000 to develop a DAO framework (on top of Gnosis smart contracts) for decentralized AI teams. This will involve building a Proof of Concept for publishing and co-owning AI assets in a trustless manner, receiving profits generated by assets to the treasury, and sharing profits generated with team members.\n\nAlgovera\nAlgovera is a community of independent AI teams developing user-centric Web3 AI applications. We’re building an AI creator platform where teams and their community can keep ownership of and monetize their creations. We provide support to teams including funding, community events/workshops and our decentralized AI framework (DAID) provides guidance in how to build a decentralized AI DAO that is based on a vision of cooperation, sustainability and ethics. Algovera Grants 2 has funded 28 independent AI teams (called Squads) to date. We also train squads to use our decentralized AI infrastructure, which consists of decentralized storage, compute and marketplace (developed through grants from Ocean Protocol, 12+ OceanDAO grants to date and 1 Ocean Shipyard grant, and 1 Filecoin grant).\n\nAbstract\nDAO tooling can help to onboard AI developers to Web3, and improve coordination and governance within distributed AI teams. We have been setting up Squads that we fund within DAOs (currently DAOhaus) and have run into a number of problems. It is not possible for AI squads to publish and co-own IP related to data, algorithms and apps in a trustless manner, and there are no suitable tools for sharing profits generated by assets. Furthermore, existing tools are targeted at generic Web3 users, rather than data and AI teams. A UX study that we conducted showed that ownership, monetization of datasets and AI models are the most important at this time for our squads and communities.\n\nThe aims of this project proposal are to (i) build a Proof of Concept for using Gnosis to enable the publishing and co-owning of data and AI assets, as well as sharing of profits generated by assets and (ii) onboarding Algovera Squads to Gnosis and ML teams.\n\nMotivation\nAI development is currently controlled and owned by large tech companies within the singular vision of human-competition, autonomy and centralization, without consideration for society at large. We experienced this ourselves and would like to change this. We believe that AI is a common good and communities should have ownership. Although there are tools to develop AI models such as Kaggle or Huggingface, it is difficult for AI teams to keep ownership and create sustainable revenue for AI DAO communities.\n\nAI teams have hardly any experience with Web3, Gnosis and DAO frameworks. Through our research and qualitative interviews, we found there is some awareness in the value of decentralized AI specific tools and architecture but most tools do not exist yet. Some of the biggest pain points for AI developers are lack of ownership around what they create in universities and tech companies, and lack of infrastructure for coordinating and monetizing their creations online.\n\nSpecification\nWork Package 1: Proof of Concept to publish data sets and AI models for monetization of marketplaces\nDuring this work package, we will implement a Proof of Concept for trustlessly publishing and co-owning IP NFTs for datasets and algorithms through a Gnosis Safe app for AI DAOs, receiving earnings generated by assets into the treasury, and distributing earnings back to the contributors/members of the team. Publishing of the asset will be performed by the multisig, with the transaction being executed after the policy defined by the multisig has been satisfied. The asset will be published with the multisig wallet address as the author and any fees associated with the consumption of the asset will be transferred to the multisig treasury. The final step to the solution is implementing profit-sharing tools to distribute earnings back to the contributors/members of the team.\n\nOverview of goals:\n\nBuild a Gnosis Safe app for AI DAOs\nPublish datasets and algorithms to Algovera/Ocean Marketplace through app\nReceive earnings from marketplace into the Gnosis treasury\nDistribute amongst DAO members\nDocumentation and video guide to onboard users\nWork Package 2: Onboarding of Algovera Squads to Gnosis and decentralized AI strategy awareness and education\nIn this work package, we will run regular Decentralized AI DAO (DAID) workshops to not only develop Web3 awareness e.g. onboard our squads to Gnosis safe and monetization tools but also to expose them to pluralistic strategies of how to develop decentralized AI organizations. We believe that bringing together GnosisDAO and AlgoveraDAO squads would be mutually beneficial to the community.\n\nCurrent centralized AI systems do not actively consider community ownership or how to integrate gender, racial or sustainability factors in developing AI models. Furthermore, researchers have highlighted the harm of AI models that are benchmarked in human-competition, autonomy and centralization [How AI Fails Us: Divya Siddarth, Glen Weyl et al. 2021]. They propose a pluralistic vision of developing AI models that complement, cooperate and support society rather than compete with humans.\n\nThis is why we have developed a Decentralized AI DAO framework 2 (DAID) which accelerates our squads with technical tools and strategies that are rooted in interdisciplinary team work, human-centered design, ethics, sustainability and community commercial models.\n\nOur goal is to host 2x interdisciplinary workshops with members of the GnosisDAO, Ocean Protocol, IPFS and Algovera communities for six months, create 6 videos and 5 tutorials to onboard our Squads to Gnosis, and to foster interdisciplinary teams to push towards the development of AI datasets and models for Web3 projects and DAOs.\n\nDAID consists of 4 key areas:\n\nPrimary - Design Thinking: who is the user and who is impacted by my AI model?\n\nCommunity Value Generators: How to achieve sustainable ethical, environmental and commercial value creation.\n\nDecentralized AI activities: from data sourcing, storage, training, deploy to publishing AI models to market places.\n\nDAO activities: covers how to set up a DAO, governance, proposals, treasury management and member protection and monetization of data sets and AI models\n\nImplementation\nThe implementations must be completed before any GIP is given status “Final”, but it need not be completed before the GIP is accepted.\n\n",

What was done so far?\n\n* [Demo ](https://prepro.yubiai.market/)\n* [Landing ](https://www.yubiai.market/)\n\n[Presentation\n](https://youtu.be/LuJ3WydMb1E)\n\nAt the core of Yubiai there are some protocols that give life to the platform:\n\n1. Gnosis Chain builds new market mechanisms for decentralized finance. Their three interoperable product lines allow you to securely create, trade, and hold digital assets on Ethereum at very cheap gas fees. Yubiai deploying on gnosis is a must, enjoy the p2p transactions of everything there is on our platform at the cheapest gas prices.\n2. ProofOfHumanity a sybil resistance protocol on the blockchain, a mechanism for social identity on ethereum.\n3. [Kleros](https://kleros.io/) Escrow, and the Dispute Resolver.\n4. Kleros Curate. “ Is this item following the marketplace rules?” By creating a list, defining guidelines and putting curation in the hands of the community you make a marketplace to operate accordingly to our own systems of rules.\n5. [TalentLayer](https://www.indie.talentlayer.org/#/) is the interoperability layer for work reputation. When you complete a job on Yubiai, you and the person you transacted with will give each other a review; growing your reputation over time. TalentLayer IDs allow freelancers on Yubiai to own your reputation as a soul-bound NFT. TalentLayer IDs are interoperable: your reputation can work on any integrated marketplaces. If you lose access to your wallet, your TalentLayer ID can be recovered to a new wallet via an emergency recovery process.\n\nTo support the team, we are asking for funding from GnosisDAO over 250000 DAI in return for 25,000,000 YBI tokens transferred soon after the deal is done.\n\n## Motivation\n\n1. Increase adoption of Gnosis Chain. This will benefit gnosis ecosystem and Yubiai users due to the low gas fees.\n2. Attract users and sellers to Yubiai.\n\nOur goal is to provide a platform where buyers & sellers meet to transact in a secure, cheap & fast way. We will build a DAO in order to have project participants be in control over the project.\n\nWe believe that bringing together GnosisDAO and YubiaiDAO would be mutually beneficial to the community. By supporting the YubiaiDAO community in technical matters, such as [Gnosis Chain deployment](https://blockscout.com/xdai/mainnet/address/0xdE677961f2a802DF105d014B8D7042914bb780cf/contracts) and Zodiac integration, the launch of YubiaiDAO could be facilitated.\n\nTo enable the YubiaiDAO launch team to keep developing pre-launch, we propose a token swap in which GnosisDAO would transfer $250,000 worth of DAI to support the project. In return, we will transfer 25,000,000 YBI tokens to GnosisDAO soon after the deal, out of a total supply of 1000M YBI tokens at launch.\n\nThe majority of the funding will go towards the development of the Yubiai Marketplace and marketing.\n\nMore information about YubiaiDAO can be found in a dedicated write-up at [Lite Paper ](https://scythe-yarn-631.notion.site/Links-f792b511b11943c4925778b3a0905eb1).\n\n## Specification\n\n* The Yubiai Marketplace will enable $CirclesUBI as currency, beside eth, dai(on Gnosis chain).\n* GnosisDAO will invest $250,000 worth of DAI in return for 25,000,000 YBI tokens out of a supply of 1,000,000,000 at the time of launch.\n* Received funds will be managed within the DAO multisig at yubiai.eth.\n* The signers consist of core YubiaiDAO members. If interested, a representative from GnosisDAO can join the signatories.\n* yubiai.eth will hold the minter role for YBI tokens.\n* A portion of the revenues, including but not limited to transaction fees generated on the Yubiai Marketplace, will flow back to YubiaiDAO.\n* Deploy of the Yubiai Marketplace on Gnosis Chain.\n\n## Rationale\n\nYubiai tackles peer to peer transactions of services, physical & digital goods, NFTs using crypto as currency, we believe that this usecase hasn’t been developed enough (most projects focusing on financial applications) and that Gnosis Chain using a stablecoin as its native token is the perfect chain for ut. Others projects attempting to create marketplaces, do not have the protocols that we are leveraging in order to provide the best and safest UX as well as all the incentives that are in place, such as the lowest fees from each transaction, leveraging the Proof Of Humanity community and being able to get the most out of their offerings for the seller and get their needs met by the buyers. The marketplace business has huge adoption of the total crypto population.\n\n\n\n## Implementation\n\nOnce this GIP gets approved, the 250k USD worth in DAI requested for development and marketing will be sent to the Yubiai’s multisig, which will administer the funds: 0x17d79CF96896c4d2aa4d4a19a2c8dD08DaFd163D. And Yubiai gnosis multisig will send 25,000,000 $YBI tokens to GnosisDAO address.\n\n## Tokenomics\n\n* User Incentives : 50%\n* Treasure/DEX Liquidity: 20%\n* Team: 15%\n* Advisors/Help: 2.5%\n* Marketing: 12.5%\n\n## Funds Allocation Details\n\n* Team salaries\n\n150k DAI\n\n* Marketing\n\n100k DAI (focusing 50% on the weeks before and during the launch). The rest to maintain a stable {but less intensive} (marketing effort for the rest of the year). This rest would be locked and would be unlocked progressively on time.\n\nTotal 250k DAI\n\n## References\n\n* [Ultra lite paper ](https://scythe-yarn-631.notion.site/Links-f792b511b11943c4925778b3a0905eb1)\n* [Testing(on goerli) ](https://app.yubiai.market/)\n* [Github ](https://github.com/yubiai)\n* [Telegram ](https://t.me/yubiai)\n* [Twitter](https://twitter.com/YubiaiM)",

      "title": "GIP-62: Should GnosisDAO Sponsor Prode Markets?",
      "content": "# Simple Summary\n\nProde is a decentralized betting platform built using Reality.eth and Kleros and currently deployed on Gnosis Chain. Unlike other projects like Omen or Azuro where 1-question markets are created and supported by liquidity providers, Prode focuses on betting pools in which users bet on multiple outcomes and compete against each other for the highest prize. This is a very popular type of sports betting scheme that has been played across the world for many decades.\n\nProde was officially launched 1 month ago after 4 months of intense work and without any external funding. To bootstrap the first markets and kickoff adoption of the platform, the Gnosis DAO could sponsor the most attractive markets in exchange for some of the creator's fee rights of the markets chosen. Additionally Gnosis DAO could provide funding to the Prode team to support the project's development and advertising. In exchange for the funds, Prode commits to giving GnosisDAO 100k USD worth of governance tokens once the Prode token is released.\n\n# Motivation\n\n1. Increase adoption of Gnosis Chain. We noticed that the onboarding of new users is an issue, because getting xDAI on Gnosis Chain for the first time is confusing and sometimes not very straightforward. There's also a lot of competition among sidechains and L2s, and Gnosis Chain is not the most popular one.\n\n2. Attract users and market creators to Prode. In the type of prediction markets Prode focuses on, users usually look for markets with potentially big prizes (a bit like a lottery). Initially, this is hard to achieve, because the dapp traffic is low and therefore there are no market creators advertising their market pools, and vice versa. One of the strategies to overcome this is to start creating markets ourselves and fund them with juicy prizes.\n\n# Specification\n\nTotal requested amount: 200k xDAI:\n\n* 100k for sponsoring markets.\n\n* 50k for the team.\n\n* 50k for marketing.\n\n### Funds Allocation Details\n\nSponsor the following markets (100k xDAI total):\n\n* FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022. 20k xDAI. Creator fees (5%) will be used to incentivize the referral program within this market.\n\n* T20 Cricket World Cup 2022. 5k xDAI. Creator fees (5%) go to UBI Burner to support the UBI price and attract its community and supporters.\n\n* F1 Grand Prix Japan & Brazil. 2.5k xDAI each. Creator fees (5%) go to GnosisDAO. Breakeven*: 50k xDAI each.\n\n* League of Legends World Cup 2022. 5k xDAI. Creator fees (5%) go to GnosisDAO. Breakeven*: 100k xDAI.\n\n* CS:GO BLAST Premier: World Final 2022. 5k xDAI. Creator fees (5%) go to a public good project TBD.\n\n* Upcoming 30 weeks of the NBA. 15k xDAI evenly split into each week matches. Creator fees (5%) go to GnosisDAO. Breakeven*: 10k xDAI per market.\n\n* Upcoming 30 matchdays of the English Premier League. 30k xDAI evenly split into each matchday market. Creator fees (5%) go to each subsequent matchday market.\n\n* Upcoming 20 matchdays of the Argentinian football league. 5k xDAI evenly split into each matchday market. Creator fees (5%) go to UBI Burner to support the UBI price and attract its community and supporters.\n\n* 5k xDAI will be converted to bet vouchers and distributed to active Proof of Humanity users instead of used to directly sponsor a chosen market. This will be important for a couple of reasons. First, it will signal what markets are preferred (at least by an active ethereum community). Second, it will bring activity and promotion to Prode. Last, it will help onboard Ethereum Mainnet users to Gnosis Chain.\n\n* Similarly, 5k xDAI will be converted to bet vouchers and distributed to active bettors of Prode's competitors, both from Gnosis Chain and other Chains.\n\n*The breakeven point refers to the market pool size needed to recover the funds. It could be lower if significant royalties are generated or if other sponsors fund the market; it could be greater if a lot of users bet in the markets through referral links. A bet placed after entering the market through a referral link will split the creator fees in halves: 50% to creator and 50% to referral.\n\nTeam funding (50k xDAI). Although the team has been self-funding the project for the past 5 months and will continue to do so in the short term, this extra funding will allow the team to start working full-time on the project for the next 6 months. Prode is currently being developed by 3 devs from the Kleros community. Additionally, this funding would be enough to hire 2 interns for communication purposes and contract free-lancing design services for the front-end and Prode's NFTs.\n\nMarketing funding (50k xDAI). Sponsoring markets alone is not enough to attract users to Gnosis Chain and Prode. The 50k USD requested will be used as follows:\n\n* ~15k xDAI will be used to partner with sports influencers/streamers/casters in order to promote Prode and its markets.\n\n* ~15k xDAI will be spent in traditional online advertising services.\n\n* Based on what is learned in the upcoming months, 20k xDAI will be used in 2023 Q1 to (1) sponsor strategic markets and (2) explore markets we haven't considered yet.\n\n### PRODE Token\n\nThe Prode protocol generates fees from each market. The team is in the process of designing a governance token that will allow holders to manage the DAO's funds and control some protocol parameters. Once the token is released, GnosisDAO will receive 100k USD worth of PRODE tokens. The price taken into account to calculate the distribution will be equal to the cheapest price the tokens were sold at.\n\n# Rationale\n\nProde markets tackle a prediction market niche that is currently unattended in the blockchain industry. On the other hand, most decentralized prediction markets platforms, which focus on single-event predictions, struggle to sufficiently incentivize liquidity providers. Prode markets don't have this problem, because the prize pool is bootstrapped from bettors themselves. However, until Prode gets more popular and its market creator-bettor ecosystem consolidates, sponsoring key markets could help adoption greatly.\n\nA bettor who is not familiar with Gnosis Chain and Prode might not be attracted to the platform if the prize pools are low. If attractive markets such as the FIFA World Cup market gets a 25k USD funding, this would be a huge incentive for new users to join the network.\n\n2022 Q4 will be a time of very popular sport events. This is a huge opportunity to gain traction. Some examples:\n\n* According to FIFA ~150 bn USD worth of bets were made during the World Cup 2018 held in Russia. We should try to capture some of this for the World Cup 2022.\n\n* Cricket is a very popular sport in Australia, India, Pakistan and England, which constitute very big and diverse markets. In october the cricket world cup will happen.\n\n* Esports have experienced a huge growth in the last decade and so have prizes and bets around its tournaments. People following esports - usually young, techy gamers - are a good fit for crypto/online bets, because they will deal better with the UX friction dapps have. There are some big tournaments coming and we should make the most of them.\n\n* While big events attract a lot of users, they happen only a few times a year at most. It's also important to incentivize smaller markets that can be played on a regular basis and thus create engagement in the long run. Football leagues are a good opportunity to test this out.\n\n# Implementation\n\nOnce this GIP gets approved, the ownership of the creator contracts of the markets mentioned above will be transferred to the GnosisDAO address on Gnosis Chain. Afterwards, either Prode's team can administer the market funding on behalf of GnosisDAO or the GnosisDAO can fund the markets directly by calling fundMarket(\"\"){value: sponsoredValue} in each market. These operational details will be discussed with the Karpatkey DAO team.\n\n5% of the pools' xDAI, including the funds sponsored, will be rewarded to the creator address when the market closes. Additionally, if bets positions get traded in a secondary market that supports royalties, the creator address (GnosisDAO or UBI Burner) will receive 1.5% of trades as royalties.\n\nThe 100k USD requested for development and marketing will be sent to the Prode's multisig, which will administer the funds, on Gnosis Chain: 0x0029ec18568F96AFE25Ea289Dac6c4703868924d.\n\n## Relevant links\n\n* App: [https://prode.eth.limo](https://prode.eth.limo/)\n* https://github.com/prodeapp\n* Twitter: https://twitter.com/prode_eth",

      "content": "## Simple Summary\n\nBootNode proposes to contribute engineering and development services to the Gnosis DAO ecosystem by building a hands-on autonomous team with relevant experience in multiple disciplines that will focus on growing the GC ecosystem adoption, starting with the following priorities:\n\n* Further strengthening and decentralizing the DAO development by incorporating an additional specialized Contributor Team working towards a shared goal.\n* Bridges operation: product discovery, development, coordination, and engineering to count with an up-to-date and sustainable Bridges operation: present infrastructure and future initiatives.\n* Circles: build the required infrastructure so many teams ideally can bring a wave of new users to the gnosis chain.\n* Gnosis Chain decentralization and security: running chain, beacon chain, and bridges nodes.\n* Other initiatives the DAO might need.\n\nThe team will commit long-term by starting with a 6-month engagement.\n\n## Motivation\n\nSince the early days, many BootNode (BN) team members have contributed to the Gnosis ecosystem by being exposed to different projects:\n\n* POA Network: creating the required infrastructure used later to build xDAI.\n* Gnosis Chain (formerly xDAI): from bootstrapping the network and being core contributors to different bridges and dApps, to educating, onboarding new projects, and consulting.\n* Core contributors to the Circles infrastructure.\n* Core contributors to the Gnosis Safe (BN became a Safe Guardian) and other projects such as Auctions, COW Protocol, Omen, and dxDAO.\n\nWe believe that the Gnosis DAO will benefit from the value BootNode can add due to its outstanding team and relevant experience. BootNode accelerates the building and growth of protocols, dApps, and networks through engineering, development, and governance.\n\nWe are confident we can work productively alongside the Gnosis DAO on different projects. We will push growth forward of the Circles, the Gnosis Chain, and other initiatives.\n\nAt BootNode, we share a vision to build a decentralized organization and network with a decentralized ecosystem of contributors. We strongly believe in a positive sum game for Gnosis DAO, where many protocol developers, web2 and web3 builders, infrastructure participants, researchers, and community members can work together.\n\n## Specification\n\nThe following items are the initial areas of contribution. However, they might change if they are no longer needed or if there are other initiatives where BootNode can provide higher value.\n\n### 1: Bridges\n\nThe team will work closely with all the involved parties to maintain and improve the bridge solutions that empower the Gnosis Chain (the native bridges [OmniBridge](https://omni.gnosischain.com/bridge) and [xDAI Bridge](https://bridge.gnosischain.com/) as well as other solutions such as [Connext Bridge](https://bridge.connext.network/) and [Hop Exchange](https://hopapp.exchange/)). Also, it will work on a new bridge that will consolidate existing options in one place. Last but not lease, we will contribute to the research and development of the trustless bridge already in progress.\n\nMilestones can change once the revised roadmap is discovered and created.\n\nMilestone #0\n\n* Goal: create a comprehensive roadmap and kick-off onboarding\n* Tasks\n  * Refine scope of work and iterate over a roadmap\n  * Define communication processes (roles, channels, etc.)\n  * Defile roles, assign responsibilities and allocate resources and team.\n  * Define specific milestones, timelines, and deliverables.\n* Deliverables\n  * A detailed roadmap with milestones, timelines, and action items.\n  * A document that defines the processes, workflows, and methodologies.\n* Outcomes\n  * Stakeholders agree on the roadmap.\n  * The team has a refined execution plan.\n  * A team with the required skills is allocated to deliver the results according to the roadmap.\n  * Kick-off date for starting executing the roadmap.\n\nMilestone #1\n\n* Goal: Maintenance and operational management\n* Tasks\n  * Improve financial operations of the bridges.\n    * Native Bridges (Omni + xDAI).\n    * Non-native bridges (Connext + Hop).\n  * Identify liquidity management needs on other bridging solutions such as Hop and Connext.\n  * Develop monitoring tools and dashboards to measure financial performance easily.

As a result, the enormous potential of this ecosystem is not being fully realized. However, we could envision a possible roadmap:\n\n* Contribution to user-friendly frontends, including Circles.Land and Gnosis Safe.\n* Backends / Subgraphs\n* Monitoring\n* Dashboards\n* SDKs\n* Tech support to other teams building on Circles infrastructure\n* Contribute onboarding DAOs to benefit from Circles features.\n\nRoadmap: it is currently under development being built by several parties. To be published soon.\n\nScope of Work: Bootnode's team has already been working on this initiative as an ongoing project since May 2022, contributing with: back-end, front-end, QA, UI, and Project Management.\n\nAs an outcome of this proposal, we expect to maximize the overall Circles UBI growth.\n\nThe ecosystem will initially benefit as follows:\n\n* Circles users (individuals and DAOs): will enjoy new features, improved reliability, and great UX.\n* Gnosis DAO: additional level of certainty in fulfilling the Circles UBI vision.\n* Projects building on top of Circles; core infrastructure:\n  * Public roadmap with the features the team will implement in the future.\n  * Access to propose and prioritize feature requests.\n* Gnosis Chain: higher block utilization due to the expected growth of the Circles protocol.\n\n### 3: Gnosis Beacon Chain decentralization and security\n\nBootNode will setup and run the Gnosis Chain full-stack (validator nodes and bridges) focusing on the Gnosis Beacon Chain and its path to the merge contributing to making it happen before Main net.\n\nRoadmap: [https://evening-lake-61d.notion.site/Gnosis-beacon-chain-merge-ca7e8759e5094b18accdc077e4959315](https://evening-lake-61d.notion.site/Gnosis-beacon-chain-merge-ca7e8759e5094b18accdc07)\n\n### 4: Gnosis DAO growth\n\nWe believe that by relying on a long-term committed engineering team, GnosisDAO ecosystem will be able to work on a more sound, clear, and executable vision, considerably increasing the probability of hitting every milestone in the roadmap. Therefore, many other Gnosis ecosystem’s efforts can count on the outcomes produced by this team:\n\n* Support community development and education about Gnosis Chain, Bridges, and Circle UBI.\n* Be available for different potential needs of the DAO and the community.\n* Support research, create, and deliver new proposals within GIPs and expand Gnosis Chain to other ecosystems (protocols, networks, infrastructures, etc.).\n* Protocol smart contracts development and GIP support.\n* Attend technical conferences and Gnosis DAO events to support growth.\n* Support pair programming sessions and education with dApp teams to share best practices and one-on-one support.\n* Bootstrap, run, and manage Gnosis Beacon Chan and Gnosis Chain validators aligning long-term via GNO incentives.\n\n### Team\n\nBootNode excellence in delivering an outstanding contribution and thinking outside the box is leveraged by already existing characteristics that have been poolish as a result of a team with an average of 10+ years of experience building and shipping software for many industries and 5+ years for the EVM ecosystem in particular.\n\nWe have identified the right candidates to build a **6 to 8 members cross-functional and autonomous team (a Squad)** with all the required skills to work on the proposed scope of work, contribute to the network roadmap, and other potential work valuable to the chain.\n\nSome team members have participated in designing and developing the two existing native bridges (OmniBridge and xDai Bridge) and have worked with other cross-chain projects contributing to the core protocol and integrations, such as Connext Network. Also, part of the team has been contributing to building the Circle infrastructure developing a “Group Currency” layer on top of Circles for a couple of months and is fully knowledgeable about it.\n\nBootNode’s track record of experience in the field provides a competitive advantage to the GC that could speed the solution, derisk the DAO, and meet expectations.\n\n### Progress status\n\n* Bi-monthly progress reports in the forum.\n* Participation in the community calls.\n* Discord channels.\n* Roadmap, backlog, prioritization discussions, etc. are transparent and visible in notion, GitHub, and any other tool consistent with the other teams.\n\n### Terms of the Agreement\n\n* Time horizon: 6 months (closer to the end, a follow-on proposal will be created).\n* Amount: $580k in DAI or USDC.\n* GNO: 580 GNO (exclusively for running GBC validators for at least 12 months).\n* Safe address in main net: eth:0x3bCba50Ec74d18c583e0A832DD19AE37E9348790\n\n### Duration and Termination\n\n* This proposal shall come into force and be binding upon the Parties from the date the proposal is approved by the GnosisDAO governance mechanism.\n* The GnosisDAO may terminate BootNode’s engagement under this agreement for any reason by Governance Mechanism upon a 30-day notice as a new discussion thread in the GnosisDAO forum.\n* BootNode may terminate this agreement upon a 30-day notice as a new discussion thread in the GnosisDAO forum.\n* Without previous notification, BN will be entitled to terminate this agreement if GnosisDAO fails to make payments for more than 2 consecutive periods.\n\n# About BootNode\n\n**[BootNode](http://bootnode.dev/)** is a long-term dev & engineering partner focused on the Ethereum ecosystem that accelerates the development and adoption of decentralized infrastructure, protocols, applications, and ecosystems through engineering and investment.\n\nFounded by a team of engineers with an average of 10+ years of experience building and shipping highly available, highly scalable software for many industries and 3+ years for the blockchain ecosystem in particular.\n\nBoot Node contributes in different phases as an interdisciplinary team, from ideation to massive adoption. \n\n> more details in the forum.",

      "title": "GIP-60: Should Gnosis pilot a DAOcast?",
      "content": "# [Gnosis DAOcast](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vR2xKzpdKsLaua3ShSSERnAu3a9xqd19oAsl-mGUrn5vDUFah0LNx9kjpeAtaKOZTj0D60Bj-uI8Z2E/pub?start=false&loop=false&delayms=5000)\n## Proposal Summary\nPilot a weekly live broadcast to communicate the latest developments in the Gnosis DAO ecosystem, and provide a new way to grow the community through education and fun.  \n\n## Background & Motivation\nAll public-facing DAO activities and decisions (community calls, AMA’s, forum discussions, snapshot votes, etc.) can be harnessed to generate content that amplifies the work of the community, and establish a unique narrative. Gnosis DAO is a dynamic project with respected status in the industry; a live broadcast designed to cover its activities would serve as a marketing resource, increase community engagement, and add a new layer of communications transparency.\n\n## Specification \n\nDAOcast Format\n\n* **Episode length**: ~1 hour\n\n* **Frequency**: Bi-weekly\n\n* **Pilot Duration:** 16 weeks (8 total episodes)\n\n* **Logistics**: Show hosted on Twitter Spaces + audio combined with visual overlays via OBS to be run live on YouTube. This format can enable Gnosis DAO to grow its audience on two of the most important social media platforms in the industry simultaneously. \n\n* **Content options:**  We have a variety of content ideas for the pilot; there is a lot of room for creativity and we are open to suggestions. After feedback from the Gnosis team, we will focus primarily on content that helps to highlight the Gnosis Chain ecosystem, while also helping to communicate wider developments in the DAO. \n\n* **Post-Show Highlights:** Following each program, we will cut at least two (2) highlights from the broadcast. At least one (1) of these cuts will be 2m 20s or under for use as twitter native video; both cuts will be posted independently on YouTube to create a consistent posting cadence required to gain traction with the algorithm.\n\n* **Aesthetic Design:** All visuals used on YouTube will be aligned with the branding expectations of Gnosis DAO.\n\n## How will we measure success?\nIn order to achieve success, alignment with existing Gnosis DAO marketing / communications goals is required. Should this initiative take flight, we hope to work closely with relevant teams to ensure we are rowing in the same direction. We propose three KPI categories for evaluating the pilot ([view table](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1uqSBzjHZon8GMZdGUOpqIePNlrsGp8G4VWPHsFghrQA/edit?usp=sharing)), and will log data after each show. \n\n\n\n## Why our team?\n\nWe have excellent knowledge of the web3 space, context on Gnosis DAO, and the logistical and technical expertise required to research, plan, and execute consistent content creation. \n\nRelevant work samples with Gnosis Chain:\nPost-produced content\n* [Gnosis Chain Defi Ecosystem](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPYYKz0u9K0)\n* [Gnosis Chain DAO Tooling + Infrastructure](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAw1paJKcqc)\n\nInterview-style GC Show [live stream + highlights]\n* [GC Show - QiDAO](https://youtu.be/XsP9icavQ44) + Highlight [A](https://youtu.be/sMOg2AKGtgA) , [B](https://youtu.be/tXjOd_I6_g8)\n* [GC Show - Twitter Thread w/ XP Network](https://twitter.com/gnosischain/status/1537717038860443648?s=20&t=P0pgmjg5kgREZh3jOxWDDQ)\n\nTeam Members\n\n* @twells - project manager\n* @itsyaboi - video magic\n* @Sapote - audio magic\n\n## How much will it cost?\n**Tokens Requested:** 4,000 xDai/USDC + ~7.5 GNO (at current market price)\n**Recipient Address::** 0x9638530aA558c81253625d42f3018BC1544D9Dd3\n**Network:** Gnosis Chain\n**Requested Payment Date:** Monthly payment is preferred (4 month pilot).\n\n## Conclusion\nWe've had a great experience working with members of the Gnosis Chain team, and are enthusiastic about contributing to the larger DAO through this new media initiative. Your vote and feedback are greatly appreciated!\n",

      "title": "GIP-57: Should Gnosis DAO support research of a zkSNARK-enabled light client and bridge?",
      "content": "## Simple Summary\n\nThe current Gnosis bridge is a based on a multi-sig design. However, multi-sig bridges have known weaknesses, particularly their reliance on a relatively centralized set of operators--see the recent [Ronin bridge](https://cointelegraph.com/news/axie-infinity-s-ronin-bridge-hacked-for-over-600m) and [Harmony bridge](https://techcrunch.com/2022/06/24/harmony-blockchain-crypto-hack/) hacks, in which hundreds of millions of dollars of funds were stolen by attackers who gained access to multi-sig keys. SNARK-enabled bridges--sometimes called [\"trustless\" bridges](https://ethereum.org/en/bridges/)--potentially have better security properties. We propose to build prototypes of essential infrastructure for a potential SNARK-enabled bridge for Gnosis to Eth2 bridging.\n\n\n## Abstract\n\n- Build essential infrastructure that can be used in the future to create and productionize a SNARK-enabled bridge for Gnosis Chain / Eth2. Note that it is **not** in the scope of this specific grant to take the bridge all the way to production on mainnet—this work will allow us to assess the viability of a production bridge and build out the key infrastructure. Productionization, if it happens, would be a future project.\n- Create a foundation for Gnosis’ ZK roadmap and expertise.\n\n## Motivation\nTo build the components of a SNARK-enabled bridge for Gnosis Chain, an Eth2 compatible light client must be implemented on the EVM. Because the EVM does not have precompiles for the BLS12-381 curve used in Eth2, implementing this directly in Solidity would result in impractically high gas costs.  As a result, this approach to bridging was unexplored until it was made practical by recent advances in zero-knowledge proofs.\n\nThe 0xPARC community has developed extensive expertise in ZK-SNARKs broadly and has built several advanced ZK circuit primitives which can now enable these types of applications. We believe that we can design a circuit which  significantly reduces the gas cost of running a light client on EVM by moving the verification of the aggregated BLS signature and the Merkle tree inclusion proof off-chain.\n\n## Specification\n\nBuilding this SNARK-enabled bridge will require three important components:\n\n1) A Solidity smart contract which implements the [Eth2 light client spec](https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/blob/dev/specs/altair/sync-protocol.md). \n2) A zkSNARK circuit that verifies the aggregated BLS signature of the [sync committee](https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/blob/dev/specs/altair/beacon-chain.md#sync-committee), verifies the Merkle tree inclusion proofs with SSZ for serializiation, and verifies the current sync committee from the previous block header.\n3) An operator node implementation which can keep the light client up to date.\n\n\n## Rationale\n\n### SNARK-enabled Bridge Pros & Cons\n\nPros:\n\n- Security: SNARK-enabled bridges can be safer than centrally-operated multisig bridges.  Funds cannot be unilaterally stolen by a small set of coordinated operators or hackers by obtaining a known set of private keys (see the $500mm [Ronin bridge hack](https://cointelegraph.com/news/axie-infinity-s-ronin-bridge-hacked-for-over-600m) and the $100mm [Harmony bridge hack](https://techcrunch.com/2022/06/24/harmony-blockchain-crypto-hack/)). Instead, the security of a SNARK-enabled bridge relies on the honesty of a larger and regularly-shuffled sync committee as defined in the eth2 light client spec.\n\nCons:\n\n- Operating expense: Our estimates suggest it will cost ~0.008 ETH per light client header update at 40 gwei gas price as well as ~0.008 ETH per withdraw operation on the bridge. The frequency of light client updates is up to the operator. In the most extreme case, updating the light client every 10 minutes for a year would cost ~420 ETH. Updating every two hours would cost ~35 ETH.\n\nAdditionally, regardless of what cryptographic mechanisms are used, bridges cannot provide security beyond the consensus mechanisms of the source and target chains.  Even with the efficiencies provided by zkSNARKs, such limitations will be governed by the size of potential PoS penalties on either chain.\n\n## Implementation\n\n### Work Breakdown\n\n**Timeline:** 10 weeks (July 4 - September 9) for Phase 1 and Phase 2\n\n**Phase 1:** \n\nThe goal of Phase 1 will be to deliver prototypes of the three important components above. In particular, we will deliver a smart contract that implements the Eth2 light client spec with as much computation as possible moved off-chain with a zkSNARK circuit to make gas costs feasible.\n\nThe SNARK circuit will do three things:\n\n- verify the BLS signatures of the sync committee\n- verify the Merkle tree inclusion proofs using SSZ for serialization used in several places in the light client\n- verify the current sync committee from the previous block header\n\nThe Solidity smart contract will generally implement the Eth2 light client spec substituting out the BLS signature verification and Merkle tree inclusion proofs with a snark verification, reducing gas costs.\n\nWe will also provide an operator node implementation which periodically updates the light client with the proof generated by the SNARK circuit.\n\n**Phase 2**\n\nIn Phase 2 of the of the grant, we aim to have public-facing polished artifacts and deliverables including the smart contracts and circuits from Phase 1. The artifacts include the following:\n\n- public open-source repo with smart contract light client and SNARK circuits with clear documentation\n- ZK light client deployed to testnets (Ethereum and Gnosis Chain) with a prototype operator that generates proofs and pings contracts with block headers every 10 minutes\n- public open-source repo with a prototype bridge contract that calls the light client smart contract and a prototype UI that allows for use generating inclusion proofs and bridging funds\n- prototype bridge contract deployed to test nets and example of SNARK-enabled bridging on testnets\n- public blog post explaining what we built: the technical architecture of a SNARK-enabled bridge, high-level technical explanation of circuits and how all the components fit together, and a precise breakdown of both security guarantees as well as risks/limitations/failure modes of a SNARK-enabled bridge.\n- stretch: blog post series diving deeper into technical details of each component\n\n## Deliverables\n\n### Grant Allocation\n\nThe core team that would recieve this grant is part of the 0xPARC organization. 0xPARC is trying out a unique, experimental public-goods collective grant sharing proposal for this project. In particular, the proceeds from this grant will be split **50/50** between the core team and donations to various dependencies the project relies on (i.e. open source circuits, public goods resources) as well as the 0xPARC community. \n\nThe reason for this split is this project is only made possible by extensive open-source work by co-dependencies in the 0xPARC and broader ZK communities (such as circom, made by iden3).\n\nThis innovative model for grant-funding and support for public goods will also be mentioned in the blog post, as we want this project to push the narrative from both a technical standpoint as well as a community & grant-funding standpoint.\n\n**We are requesting a total of $600k (600k USDC) across two project phases: $300k will go to the team and $300k will go to the broader ZK community and public goods (distribution determined by core team).** We expect that the project will take around 30 engineering weeks for the core team, in addition to supporting work from various dependencies and public goods that make this project possible. As described above, half of the grant will be distributed by the core team to the broader ZK community and various co-dependencies (which may include prior work by team members, as well as future ZK projects that opt into 50/50). Note that the core team, not GnosisDAO, will be deciding on the distribution of the $300k set aside for broader ZK community and public good contributions.\n\n**Phase 1: $120K for Team + $180K Public Goods/0xPARC ZK Ecosystem**\n\nThe funding for this phase will be paid out in advance of work starting on Phase 1. The deliverables for this phase include the following:\n\n- [ ] ZK circuit template for BLS signature aggregation and verification\n- [ ] ZK circuit template for SSZ Merkle tree inclusion proofs\n- [ ] ZK circuit for verifying the sync committee form the previous block header\n- [ ] Solidity smart contract for running the light client according to the Eth2 spec on EVM\n- [ ] an operator node implementation which periodically submits new headers and proofs of the ZK circuit to the light client\n\n**Phase 2: $180K for Team + $120K Public Goods/0xPARC ZK Ecosystem**\n\nThe funding for this phase will be paid out after the completion of Phase 1 (as judged by Stefan and Martin of Gnosis) and before starting of Phase 2. The deliverables of this phase include the following: \n\n- [ ] extensive documentation of all circuits, contracts, and code\n- [ ] ZK light client deployed to test nets on Ethereum and Gnosis Chain with a prototype operator that generates proofs and pings contracts with block headers periodically\n- [ ] prototype bridge contract + UI that can bridge assets from Gnosis Chain to Ethereum\n- [ ] blog post explaining what we built ranging from the technical architecture of a SNARK-enabled bridge and how all the components fit together\n\nThe address of the SAFE to provide funds to is: 0xFeB39382FCBE6035e0bE2263Ba474390AB926eE4\nhttps://gnosis-safe.io/app/eth:0xFeB39382FCBE6035e0bE2263Ba474390AB926eE4/home\n\n## Team\n\n\n- Uma Roy\n    - Summer resident at 0xPARC.

These secure time-locked contracts allow teams to lock up their tokens over a preset period of time in a trustless way. This includes Liquidity Pair (LP) tokens and NFTs as well.\n\nToken Mint: Anyone can easily generate a new token contract that is fully audited and customizable without needing to write any code or hire expensive developers. Mint makes it easy to tokenize any project, business, or community.\n\nVesting: The TrustSwap Vesting portal provides a simple and secure way for projects to distribute their tokens over time to their team and community. The tokens are released in regular increments and users can claim their available tokens whenever they want.\n\nBy using TrustSwap services, crypto projects can easily create, secure, and launch their new tokens across multiple blockchains currently including Ethereum, Polygon, Binance Smart Chain, Avalanche, and more. We would like to add Gnosis to this list and appreciate the support of the GnosisDAO community. \n\nIf you have any questions, please email info@trustswap.org. Thank you.",

Explore the use of an institutional MakerDAO vault with the GnosisDAO treasury using GNO + stETH and mint 100 million DAI to be used for the development of the Gnosis Chain\n3. Explore a GNO grant with MakerDAO growth core unit to expand global adoption and brand awareness of Gnosis Chain\n4. Rebranding xDAI to DAI\n5.

      "content": "Summary\n\nFollowing the token merger (STAKE to GNO), the former xDai team has finalized the transfer of infrastructure and assets to the GnosisDAO technology team. While many prior responsibilities of the team have been reallocated to GnosisDAO core team members, xDai team engineers are still interested in working on a focused scope of activities including:\n\nTechnical support for the consensus layer/execution layer (GBC/GC) merge\nRollup research, analysis and support\nOpen-source explorer development – Blockscout\nParticipation in select ecosystem working groups\nResearch on trustless bridges\nSecurity issue consultation\nGnosis Beacon Chain validator support\n\nThis post provides an overview of the infrastructure transfer to date. It will be followed by a snapshot temperature check for the community to determine if they would like to see the former xDai team continue working on this focused scope or would prefer to keep these tasks in-house with the internal Gnosis core team.\n\nWhat has been accomplished\n\nThe token merger has involved physical and knowledge transfer of many important items from the xDai operations team to the Gnosis team. Gnosis is now responsible for the ownership and management of all essential chain operations. The following have been transferred from xDai to Gnosis:\n\nPublic RPC endpoint hosting and maintenance\nGnosis Beacon Chain explorer\nBridge infrastructure management\nBridge governance management\nProject GitHub repositories\nValidator onboarding processes\nPublic facing websites, domains, and hosting\nDocumentation sites\nMarketing activities and business development\nCommunity management\nSocial media accounts (Twitter, Discord, Substack)\nImmunefi Bug Bounty Program\nListings on Centralized Exchanges (Huobi, AscendEX, Gate.io)\nRevenue from compounding and fees on xDai Bridge\nRevenue from compounding and fees on Omni Bridge on ETH<>GC, ETH<>BSC bridges\nRevenue from gas fees collected by EIP-1559 implementation on Gnosis Chain\nMoving Forward\nNow that primary daily operations are under Gnosis control, the former xDai team is assessing options for future involvement. Their engineering team is interested in continued work, research, and consultation in several specific areas outlined below.\n\nConsensus layer/Execution layer (Gnosis Beacon Chain / Gnosis Chain ) Merge\n\nThe merge is fast approaching and there are many moving pieces to the upgrade. While it will be coordinated and executed by the Gnosis internal team, the xDai team would be available for technical consultation, assistance, and troubleshooting preceding and following the merge.\n\nProvide technical support for merge preparation and execution\nConsult as needed on technical questions and issues\nProvide expertise and answer questions related to the current GC/GBC implementations which were developed and deployed by the xDai team\nConduct research on related merge topics and best practices within the ecosystem\n\nRollup research, analysis and support\n\nL2 rollups are an area of continued interest. Optimism on Gnosis Chain is experiencing increasing volume and projects are exploring rollup environments. The xDai team spearheaded these deployments and would like to continue with their development and optimization.\n\nAnalyze usage and perform stress testing on current implementations\nTune parameters to maximize throughput\nExplore interoperability between L1/L2 environments\nResearch zk rollups and deploy test environments for further research\n\nOpen-source explorer – Blockscout\n\nBlockscout has been the primary explorer for Gnosis Chain since its inception. Updates, new feature implementation and ongoing support should be prioritized for Gnosis Chain execution-layer environments.\n\nHosting and supporting Blockscout instances for Gnosis Chain and Gnosis Chain Testnet on Blockscout’s premises\nRebranding of Blockscout to follow the new Gnosis Chain brand guidelines\nPremium modules such as Blockscout Account, Smart contract verification, App store, etc.\nPriority support and priority updates\nBlockscout for Optimism on Gnosis Chain (unofficial deployment of Optimism)\n\nParticipation in select ecosystem working groups\n\nTo stay up-to-date with current deployments, issues and other relevant topics the team would maintain participation in certain working groups.\n\nParticipate in relevant groups at the xDai team’s discretion.\nRetain access to new and existing workgroups and leave extraneous groups.\n\nResearch on trustless bridges\n\nTrustless bridges are an exciting area of research relevant to the Gnosis Beacon Chain implementation. We would explore methods and work towards a proof-of-concept bridge that does not need relayers when moving assets between Ethereum and Gnosis Chain.\n\nResearch and define requirements for trustless bridge implementation\nEstablish working model and PoC\n\nSecurity issue consultation\n\nThe xDai team has in-depth knowledge and expertise with the current codebase. Should an issue arise the team would be available to research, analyze and consult on possible solutions.\n\nMaintain open communication channels related to security concerns\nProvide assistance and advice should security-related issues arise\n\nGnosis Beacon Chain validator support\n\nThe xDai team has been involved with onboarding for GBC validators since the chain launch. The team would like to continue with onboarding assistance for new validators and community management of the current validator set.\n\nProvide assistance to Gnosis Beacon Chain validators in all areas related to initial setup and operations.\nCommunity management activities (troubleshooting, recommendations, answering questions, providing resources) for current Gnosis Beacon Chain validators.\n\nCommunity Input\n\nWe would like to hear from the GnosisDAO community about their preferences for continued involvement of the xDai team. Would the community like to support the xDai external team or prefer to incubate and support an internal team managed by Gnosis for the aforementioned activities?\n\nIn this advisory format, the xDai team would retain 100% autonomy and responsibilities would be limited to the tasks outlined above. In this capacity, the xDai team would be available for consultation and peer review but would not be responsible for execution or coordination of essential tasks and/or remediation of any bugs/concerns/issues.\n\nIn addition to feedback on this post we plan to conduct a snapshot temperature check to gauge community interest in the xDai team continuing to work with the Gnosis team.",

The incentives should be designed together with other projects, which are operating on top of Uniswap v3 such as Perpetual Protocol, Gelato, or Stakewise. This should allow for more sustainable utilization of Uniswap as Gnosis Chain doesn’t have a team dedicated to Uniswap v3. The GNO can be used to incentivize liquidity but should not be limited to this use case. Anything increasing usage of Uniswap v3, including building new applications on top of Uniswap v3 should be supported. The goal is to spend the $10M in the time period of 2 years. Funds not used after two years would go back to GnosisDAO. The spending is limited to $10M and the transferred amount of GNO as part of the proposal. GnosisDAO can decide to top up this amount based on the outcome of this initiative.",

Previous expenditures were provided up-front by the team to facilitate client development and bootstrap the consensus-layer validator set. These were distributed from an independent fund managed by the Core Dev Unit to expedite processes with the expectation that they would be reimbursed at a future date. This GIP details prior expenditures and requests they are reimbursed from the GnosisDAO treasury.\n\n![image](ipfs://QmNbgiSD9x1pt4nm9CzHKB8Tvk7Ka2NZFwmto1cy3Gjvn2)\n\nImplementation\nThe Unit has a multi-signature wallet to administer the funds allocated to fulfilling the mandate. The details of this multi-sig wallet are as follows:\n\nMultisig address on ETH mainnet: 0x5E78C09984bd6608f8E913F0924062C043eD6ad7",

      "content": "The proposal is available [here](https://forum.gnosis.io/t/gip-13-phase-2-cowdao-and-cow-token/2735/1). It is recommended to read it in the forum where proper formatting is available. \n\nThe proposed deployment code for this proposal is available [here](https://github.com/gnosis/cow-token/) and an audit is available [here](https://github.com/gnosis/cow-token/blob/main/audits/2021-12_G0-group.pdf).\n\n# What is CowDAO envisioned to be? \n\nCowDAO is an open organization of developers, traders, market makers and many more community members aligned with its vision. CowDAO is focused on fair and decentralized trading systems - in particular, building, maintaining and advancing the Cow Protocol. Cow Protocol technology powers a network of traders and solvers, enabling trustless and efficient peer-to-peer trading. Leveraging batch auctions as a key concept uniquely positions Cow Protocol as native trading infrastructure for discrete-time settlement layers like Ethereum and enables fair and accessible trading to its users.\n\n# Vision\n\nWe foresee a future where increasingly all kinds of assets will be tokenized on Ethereum and other decentralized blockchains, where everyone - individuals and collectives - can have full custody of their tokenized assets. CowDAO's vision is a decentralized future where digital assets can be traded in a fair, efficient and reliable manner among people and communities around the world. Our mission is to build a protocol that becomes the most user friendly and price effective way to exchange digital assets, enabling all users to trade securely and know their trades are protected.\n\nWe are determined to make Cow Protocol the foundational liquidity hub for trading digital assets by applying continuous innovation, cultivating intellectual bravery and by expanding the CoW Protocol ecosystem - inviting the brightest minds to join the community.\n\n# Values and Principles\n\nThis section should not limit the scope of what CowDAO can pursue or achieve. The community should keep iterating on its values and principles to best reflect each and every member individually and the DAO as a whole.\n\nBelow are work in progress principles that we propose should guide the way we behave as a community and help shape the decision process for CowDAO.\n\n# Universal Simplicity\n\nThe goal of Cowswap is to allow easy access to the decentralized economy across all levels of experience, the Cowswap community will focus on simplicity and high quality user experience across DeFi and Web3.\n\n# Decentralization and Access to everybody\n\nCow Protocol is permissionless for anyone to access with no discrimination. The Cowswap community will reward alternative UIs and gateways to the protocol in order to ensure easy worldwide access and usability in accordance with applicable laws.\n\n# Open Collaboration\n\nCowSwap should be a core part of Ethereum and Web3, we believe this can be achieved by openly collaborating with other teams, protocols and communities in the decentralized ecosystem. Education, information sharing and aligned partnerships are key drivers to build out the CowSwap ecosystem.\n\n# Proposed Governance Parameters for CowDAO Launch \n\n-   CowDAO proposals will be discussed on CowDAO's dedicated Forum, consisting of two phases: forum discussion and snapshot voting.\n\n-   Final approval of proposals will be made through vCOW token voting on the cow.eth snapshot space that will be deployed upon GIP-13 successfully passing.\n\n-   A maximum amount of 560M vCOW tokens will become available, out of which it  is estimated that up to 350m vCOW tokens might  be used  for voting initially. A quorum is proposed that would require roughly 10%  of this supply for approving CowDAO Improvement Proposals (CIP). This is defined by a set limit of  35m COW tokens required to vote YES in order for a proposal to pass.\n\n-   Additionally, in order for a proposal to be approved, YES votes should account for >50% of total participating votes.

We'll offer education and collaborative research for Token Engineers specializing in Governance, the aim is to come up with Zodiac DAO Improvement proposals.\n\nAbstract\n--------\n\nIn November 2021, we'll kick-off a community research initiative on Rewards Systems and bring together 20-30 researchers from various backgrounds to work on Rewards Systems for DAOs. The work will be based on real DAO cases. We'll offer an extensive educational program and facilitate the research process to create maximum output.\\\nThis is an excellent opportunity for Gnosis Zodiac to create attention, and work collectively on Zodiac DAO Improvement Proposals.\n\nMotivation\n----------\n\nRewards Systems are a vital element for DAOs to compensate builders for contributions and grant decision-making power and co-ownership to those who are so critical for a DAO's value. Ecosystem Development via proposals and grants has become a popular method to distribute funds, and establish a shared perspective on value-add. All Rewards Systems need reliable value assignment, to ultimately lead to a healthy reward distribution.\n\nThe Governauts Rewards System Research initiative will explore:\n\n-   How to best track contributions and account for the richness of value adds that come in many forms: code, communication, care, creativity\n-   how to assign value, how to define value and associated roles, and permissions\n-   what do stakeholders expect from rewards, and does the system in place meet these requirements\n-   what are metrics to measure the reward system healthiness - in its respective lifecycle\n\nSpecification\n-------------\n\nWe'll provide education:\n\n-   case introductions:\n-   DAO cases with a Rewards System in production (TE Commons, Ocean DAO, NearDAO etc.)\n-   partner talks, incl. Zodiac\n-   Token Engineering fundamentals\n-   DAO case studies and insights from Gitcoin, CommonsStack, BlockScience, TE Commons, and more\n-   multidisciplinary insights from game design, behavioral economics, currency design, and monetary theory\n\nand mentoring:\n\n-   define an own research question in the scope of Rewards Systems\n-   use methods from the Token Engineering toolkit\n-   form multidisciplinary teams\n-   produce actual outcome\n\nThis program is open to anyone, and free.\\\nWe'll have an application process to ensure that participants\n\n-   have the right background, e.g., Political Science, Behavioral Economics, Mechanism Design or Data Analytics\n-   commit the next three months to work on Rewards System Research questions\n-   attend an education program, learn and work on a self-defined research question\n\nRationale\n---------\n\nThis program is organized by TE Academy. The mission of TE Academy is to develop the Token Engineering discipline and grow the number of skilled Token Engineers in crypto. TE Academy has run research initiatives like this several times already:\n\n-   [Gitcoin Grants Quadratic Funding 2](https://gitcoin.co/blog/token-engineering-open-science-program-a-multidisciplinary-study-of-gitcoin-grants/)\n-   [Balancer Simulations](https://youtu.be/q0dmFNPDBuw)\n-   [OMNIPool Engineering and Simulations](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-GxJch-YeZfjcwjCwwNSRGjnSBdapOtA)\n-   About [TE Academy Research Groups 1](https://youtu.be/_qNnVgIAmro)\n\nIncubating Governauts is an initiative to establish a dedicated branch in Token Engineering focused on decentralization and governance.\\\nWe organize workshops and discussions, provide a platform for collaboration and bring research programs to life with TE Academy.\n\nImplementation\n--------------\n\nWe'll deliver in three steps:\n\n-   Zodiac workshop:\\\n    with researchers, partners and DAO stakeholders as a roundtable to create awareness and set the scope for Zodiac DAO Improvement Proposals\n-   Research documentation:\\\n    community researchers work on Rewards Systems and\n    -   document their results in public HackMDs/Github repos and\n    -   discuss progress in weekly sessions (all sessions are recorded and shared publicly!)\n    -   share their results in a final presentations event (public)\n-   Handover to Zodiac bounty/grant program\\\n    to further develop most interesting results in DAO Improvement proposals\n",

      "content": "## Simple Summary\nThis is a proposal to update the GnosisDAO's governance structure in a way that keeps the benefits of off-chain voting while allowing for trustless and permissionless on-chain execution, using the recently released [DAO module and SafeSnap plugin](https://blog.gnosis.pm/introducing-safesnap-the-first-in-a-decentralized-governance-tool-suite-for-the-gnosis-safe-ea67eb95c34f).\n\n## Motivation\nThe current governance structure is designed to be maximally inclusive: gas-free voting with delegation. This, however, comes at the cost of some additional trust in the system. Primarily, GnosisDAO must trust that the GnosisDAO Safe multi-sig will faithfully execute its will on-chain.\n\nIn order to make the GnosisDAO more autonomous, we should more meaningfully give it control over its on-chain execution.\n\n## Specification\nGnosis Ltd recently developed the [DAO module](https://github.com/gnosis/dao-module) and [SafeSnap Snapshot Plugin](https://github.com/snapshot-labs/snapshot.js/tree/master/src/plugins/daoModule).\n\nIn combination with the Gnosis Safe, this tool allows for:\n\n* Trustless and permissionless on-chain execution of arbitrary function calls\n* Continued use of our existing Snapshot strategies (ERC20 BalanceOf and Delegated ERC20 BalanceOf)\n* Cheap/free and low friction participation for Participants.\n\n## Rationale\nAs described in the [SafeSnap announcement post](https://blog.gnosis.pm/introducing-safesnap-the-first-in-a-decentralized-governance-tool-suite-for-the-gnosis-safe-ea67eb95c34f), the path to progressive decentralization can be broken down into three steps.\n\n1. **Multi-sig as a proxy:**  Gnosis Safe + Snapshot, in which the multi-sig promises to act in accordance with the off-chain votes. This is the status quo.\n2. **Multi-sig as a safeguard:**  Gnosis Safe + Snapshot + SafeSnap, in which on-chain execution of off-chain votes is handled by the SafeSnap module, but there are still multi-sig owners that can veto malicious actions or act quickly in the case of an emergency.\n3. **Look ma, no hands!:**  Gnosis Safe + Snapshot + SafeSnap, in which the multi-sig owners have been removed, and the only way to execute transactions is via the SafeSnap module.\n\nThis proposal is to move from (1) to (2) by deploying an instance of the DAO module, enabling it in the GnosisDAO Gnosis Safe, and updating the GnosisDAO Snapshot space to include the SafeSnap module.\n\n## Implementation\nThe DAO module should have the following parameters set:\n\n* **Oracle:**  GNO denominated instance of Reality.eth `0x8f1CC53bf34932591177CDA24723486205CA7510`\n* **Reality question timeout:**   `48 hours`\n* **Proposal cooldown:**   `48 hours`\n* **Proposal expiration:**   `7 days`\n* **Minimum bond:**   `10 GNO`\n* **Question Template:**  [see this document](http://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmP5ptVAmAcBLJB5bpZntADLieaWRc2iN2V8UQBRoQDA56)\n* **Arbitrator:** Reality.eth contract, so that it is not possible to call arbitration\n`0x8f1CC53bf34932591177CDA24723486205CA7510`\n\n\n**Transactions that need to be executed:**\n\nOn the [`gnosis.eth` ENS name](https://app.ens.domains/name/gnosis.eth):\n* update  `snapshot`  text record to  `ipfs://QmPdrDbYVPCz6ASgYvvYWkdpDmZ7pph7TnT4K3zhq1dfP7`\n* update  `daorequirements`  text record to  `ipfs://QmP5ptVAmAcBLJB5bpZntADLieaWRc2iN2V8UQBRoQDA56`\n* set  `registrant`  and  `controller`  to  `0x0DA0C3e52C977Ed3cBc641fF02DD271c3ED55aFe`\n\nOn the [deployed DaoModule](0x0eBaC21F7f6A6599B5fa5f57Baaa974ADFEC4613):\n* update  `questionArbitrator`  to  `0x8f1CC53bf34932591177CDA24723486205CA7510`\n* update  `minimumBond`  to  `10 GNO`\n* update  `questionCooldown`  to  `48 hours`\n\nOn the [GnosisDAO's safe](http://gnosis-safe.io/app/#/safes/0x0DA0C3e52C977Ed3cBc641fF02DD271c3ED55aFe/transactions):\n* call  `enableModule(\"0x0eBaC21F7f6A6599B5fa5f57Baaa974ADFEC4613\")`",

      "content": "### SIMPLE SUMMARY\n\nThis is a proposal to implement a private ordering agreement (a so-called “Participation Agreement”) among all GnosisDAO participants to provide an operating framework for the GnosisDAO and to govern the rights and obligations of each party.\n\n### ABSTRACT\n\nThe participation agreement:\n- explains the GnosisDAO’s governance mechanism and determines who GnosisDAO participants are.\n- provides a mutual release by DAO participants from claims arising out of or in connection with the GnosisDAO and a mutual waiver of claims against the GnosisDAO and other DAO participants.\n- limits the liability of the GnosisDAO, the service providers, Gnosis Limited, and the signers in relation to loss or damage arising under or in connection with the use of GnosisDAO smart contracts.\n- provides a complaints and dispute resolution procedure.\n\n### MOTIVATION\n\nAs a DAO that is not wrapped within a legacy system legal entity, it is paramount to minimize the legal risks to GnosisDAO participants as much as possible.\n\n### SPECIFICATION\n\n[Proposed Participation Agreement](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HzK3VbOJ3MLllimKquT-SPnL81lx7n1BKEOwq1hW1hE/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n### RATIONALE\n\nThe GnosisDAO is a decentralised collective stewarding a growing ecosystem by developing and dogfooding the operating system for Ethereum and is governed by, and returns value to, the GNO token holders. It relies on the Gnosis Safe Multisig smart contracts and Gnosis Zodiac modules for DAO governance to enable transparent governance by the GNO token holders to manage the GnosisDAO and control resources transparently. Although the GnosisDAO was seeded by Gnosis Limited, Gnosis Limited has relinquished all control over the GnosisDAO. It is participant managed, and does not have any director or manager. No single party is in control. \n\nAs the GnosisDAO exists entirely on-chain, jurisdiction may not recognise it as an entity with legal personality or limited liability. While efforts are underway (notably in Wyoming, Malta and by COALA, who have been drafting a DAO Model Law), unincorporated DAOs do not operate as persons within the eyes of the law.\n\nThe attempted shoehorning of DAOs by legal systems into existing categories such as unregistered organisations, unincorporated associations or general partnerships leads to concerns that DAO participants may be held liable for the actions of the DAO. While GnosisDAO Participants cannot dictate states and state regulators how to characterise the GnosisDAO, we should use whatever private law mechanism at our disposal to frame the GnosisDAO as we see it and minimize legal risks as much as possible to the GnosisDAO, GnosisDAO participants, Gnosis Limited as the initial funder, service providers and the signers of the GnosisDAO Safe multisig.",

      "title": "GIP-9: Launch Liquidity Mining program for Prediction Markets using Gnosis Conditional Tokens",
      "content": "\n# Summary\n\nGnosisDAO will launch a Liquidity Mining program for prediction markets using Gnosis Conditional Tokens that would reward liquidity providers with GNO to incentivize a curated set of markets and thus boost the use of Gnosis Conditional Tokens.\n\n# Abstract\n\nThe GnosisDAO will allocate 120,000 GNO from the treasury for the first 12 months of this liquidity incentivization initiative. It will dynamically manage the GNO rewards distribution by assigning “allocation points” to specific markets that the GnosisDAO votes on in order to stimulate the markets with a higher participation potential or that would generate quality predictive data for the GnosisDAO. Currently, it means incentivizing mainly liquidity providers for Omen markets on xDai but the program would be open to any solution using Conditional Tokens (for example, it could also incentivize ERC20 wrapped conditional tokens on exchanges such as Uniswap, Balancer, SushiSwap, and 1inch).\n\n  \n\n# Motivation\n\nIn the current environment full of yield farming opportunities, providing capital to any protocol incurs a high opportunity cost. Moreover, prediction markets are known to be more attractive to users and more potent at predicting events when the markets are liquid and efficient enough to allow for high-scale arbitrage (cf. Vitalik Buterin [Prediction Markets: Tales from the Election](https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/02/18/election.html) blog post).\n\nAnyone can add liquidity to prediction markets using Gnosis Conditional Tokens by minting them for existing markets or even creating their own markets. Liquidity attracts traders, trading generates prediction market fees, and ultimately this profitability attracts more liquidity. This is a flywheel effect that has to be incentivized within the Conditional Tokens ecosystem in order to position ourselves in the prediction market scene.\n\nRegardless of the venue, early liquidity providers take on more risk and opportunity costs: including contract risk, low initial profitability, etc. Moreover, conditional Tokens users should get to participate early on in deciding how the GnosisDAO evolves and plans to build new versions of the Conditional Tokens.\n\nToward this end, we propose implementing a Liquidity Mining program for prediction markets using Gnosis Conditional Tokens rewarding liquidity providers with GNO tokens. These types of initiatives are proven to attract significant amounts of capital into products and to kickstart a virtuous cycle of additional liquidity (see the examples of Balancer, Sushiswap, and 1inch) and thus improved user experience and efficiency which will, in turn, bring more usage to Conditional Tokens.\n\nThe indirect benefits of this program for the GnosisDAO are multiple:\n\n-   Fostering the use of one of Gnosis core products (CT framework).\n    \n-   Upgrading the distribution of GNO by rewarding it to valuable community members.\n    \n-   Improving the quality of data generated by prediction markets using CT.\n    \n\nThe potential direct benefits to the GnosisDAO are just waiting to be unlocked by the governance. In the future, it could take the form of the implementation of a redemption fee mechanism embedded into the Conditional Tokens framework, or of a trading fee in exchanges controlled by the GnosisDAO. Legacy prediction markets like PredictIt charge significant fees (10% of the profit on a market and 5% of withdrawals), blockchain prediction markets like Augur or Cover charge a smaller redemption fee (~1% for Augur and 0.1% for Cover). As long as the GnosisDAO provides continuous support and development for Conditional Token, a small fee will probably be accepted by the users.\n\nIt would also be possible for the GnosisDAO to find novel revenue sources around Conditional Tokens. For example, frontends controlled by the GnosisDAO could also allow users to burn some GNO in order to have their markets displayed in more attractive positions of the UI.\n\n# Specification\n\nThe GnosisDAO liquidity mining program for prediction markets using Conditional Tokens will be inspired by Balancer and SushiSwap liquidity mining programs.\n\n  \n\nFor the first year 120,000 GNO tokens, or 10,000 per month, will be distributed to liquidity providers staking their conditional tokens liquidity into the GnosisDAO liquidity mining contracts. For networks other than Ethereum mainnet (in particular xDAI), those GNO tokens would be wrapped on the particular network.\n\n  \n\nThe amount of GNO distributed to a particular liquidity pool will be determined by an allocation point system. The GNO will be distributed between pools in proportion to their allocation points and within pools in proportion to participant liquidity.  \n  \n\nFor example let’s assume there are 3 pools A, B, and C with 100, 400, and 500 allocation points, Alice has 200 ETH of liquidity in pool A which has a total of 500 ETH of liquidity. Alice would receive 10000*(200/500)*(100/1000)=400 GNO per month.\n\n  \n\nIn order to be able to rapidly incentivize new markets when opportunities come up, setting up allocation points will be done through a fast-track procedure on Snapshot which does not require going through the complete governance procedure.  \n  \n\nAny account with at least 1000 GNO (from a snapshot taken at the beginning of the month) will be able to make an allocation point proposal each month for each 1000 GNO it holds (so an address with 3000 GNO would be able to make 3 allocation proposals per month). Those would be put to vote instantly with a 1 week voting period and without quorum requirements.  \n  \n\nAn allocation proposal would contain:\n\n-   The conditional token liquidity pool to be incentivized.\n    \n-   The number of allocation points for this pool.\n    \n-   The start and finish date of the incentivization.\n    \n\n  \n\nAllocation proposals can provide allocation points to new pools or change the allocation of a current pool (including setting it to 0).\n\n  \n\n# Implementation\n\n  \nMembers of the Gnosis team will design/fork a liquidity mining rewards distribution contract (and its interface) to allow for liquidity providers to stake their Conditional Tokens and claim their rewards and set up a dedicated Snapshot space (with the >=1000 GNO proposal requirement) to allow for allocation points proposal voting.\n\n  \n\nAn explanatory thread for the streamlined Liquidity Mining allocation points governance process will be posted in GnosisDAO forum.\n",

      "content": "See the Forum post for all details and discussion: https://forum.gnosis.io/t/gip-5-remove-gnosis-impact-from-the-gnosisdao-governance-process/1058 \n\nTl;dr\n\nGnosis Impact is currently an integral component of the Gnosis governance process. The current implementation of Gnosis Impact has known flaws and poses uncalled-for obstacles to pass proposals through the governance process. I therefore propose to exclude the obligatory utilization of Gnosis Impact as part of the GnosisDAO’s governance process phase 3 until a proposal passes amending its shortcomings.\n\n\nThe Proposal\n\nThe GnosisDAO governance process currently consists of three phases:\n1.    Informal discussion on Gnosis Forum regarding potential proposal\n2.   Creation of a GIP in the Gnosis Forum, including a Forum poll\n3.   Creation of proposal on Snapshot + creation of two prediction markets on Omen, with one market collateralized in GNO and the other collateralized in a stablecoin + setting up the Gnosis Impact plugin.\n\nAs described above, phase 3 of the GnosisDAO Governance process is complex and cost intensive, making it less attractive and accessible for individuals to move their proposal forward to the final and essential governance stage that will decide on the implementation of a proposal.\n\nOther than the complexity of setting up Gnosis Impact, the tool itself currently has a few inherent flaws:\n- Due to Omen’s Fixed Product Market Maker (FPMM), all funds provided to set up the prediction markets are lost: once it becomes clear how the vote will turn out traders will buy all the winning tokens. This is making any proposal very cost intensive.\n- As setting up Gnosis Impact is very capital intensive, it is not worthwhile to process any proposal that involves less than $100k. \n- Price impacts projected by Gnosis Impact are not very accurate as a) the market prices for the outcome tokens can only be found as long as it is still open which decision will be made on Snapshot and b) because potential profit opportunities are debilitated by Omen fees and gas fees. \n\nOnly two proposals have so far been processed through phase 3 since GnosisDAO went live in November of last year, underlining the complexity of passing proposals through the final stage. Removing Gnosis Impact as a mandatory step will make GnosisDAO’s governance process simpler and economically viable and will allow more individuals to push their proposal to the final stage of governance.",

      "content": "See the [forum post](https://forum.gnosis.io/t/gip-1-one-time-5-gno-airdrop-to-active-gnosisdao-participants/690) for discussion and more details.\n\n## Simple Summary\n\nIn order to incentivize existing GNO holders to immediately become active in the GnosisDAO, the GnosisDAO should merkledrop a 5% bonus to all Gnosis Safe addresses that participate in GIP snapshot voting within the first month after the GnosisDAO launches.\n\n## Abstract\n\nThe GnosisDAO will use a merkledrop to distribute, pro-rata, 5% of the balance GNO balance held in Gnosis Safes and used to vote in the GnosisDAO within the first month after the GnosisDAO launches. For example, a safe that holds 100 GNO and casts a vote for this (or any other) GIP proposal, within the time limit, would receive 5 GNO tokens in the merkledrop.\n\n## Motivation\n\nThe motivation for this proposal is to immediately activate existing and new GNO token holders to become active in GnosisDAO governance decisions. This proposal would also help to further distribute GNO tokens in the community.\n\n## Specification\n\nThe merkledrop will use an instance of Balancer Labs' [erc20-redeemable contracts](https://github.com/balancer-labs/erc20-redeemable/tree/master/merkle) and an instance of Balancer Labs' [claim interface](https://claim.balancer.finance/#/).\n\nMore detail will be added to the specification as becomes available.\n\n## Rationale\n\nA merkledrop should be used, as opposed to other designs, so as to reduce the upfront gas cost and to require recipients to actively claim their bonus tokens.\n\n## Disclaimer\n\nThe plans outlined in this proposal are subject to discussion and change. They may also need to be (re)structured to take account of legal, regulatory, or technical developments as well as governance considerations.
