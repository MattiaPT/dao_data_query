In addition, all DAI from the existing PSM will be transferred to maintain a complete 1:1 backing against a changing circulating FEI value. \n\nThe remaining 30,666,344 DAI would be transferred to the TribeRedeemer along with all 50.3k stETH, 15,316,691 FOX and 1,101,298 LQTY.\n\nThe effective circulating TRIBE value with pro rata claims to these tokens is 458,964,340. For simplicity, this means each 10,000 TRIBE would receive at least:\n  - 668.15 DAI\n  - 1.096 stETH\n  - 333.71 FOX\n  - 23.98 LQTY\n\nThe ability to redeem TRIBE is at holder discretion and would be open indefinitely, allowing people to claim TRIBE at the time of their choosing. Two additional sources of remaining  funding would be added after the completion of the consolidation steps approved in TIP-121a:\n\n  - Selling the remaining assets in the Tribal Council Safe: 0x2EC598d8e3DF35E5D6F13AE2f05a7bB2704e92Ea \n  - Completion of the veBAL for 1M DAI OTC with Aave Companies: https://tribe.fei.money/t/aave-companies-otc-proposal-for-tribe-dao-s-vebal/4544 \n\nAny assets pending consolidation to the  PCV, such as the above, would be added to the pro-rata distribution of  PCV for TRIBE holders when available. Note that any TRIBE that claims before these consolidations will forfeit the pro-rata redemption value of these last assets from consolidation. Each TRIBE address can only redeem once.\n\nThe proposal also transfers the BAL and bb-a-USD yield from the veBAL contract to the Tribal Council Safe for the purpose of selling to DAI and distributing back in the TribeRedeemer. This is in preparation for the OTC with the Aave Companies, described above.\n\nLastly, it cleans up smart contract ACL roles and the collateralization oracle in line with the old contracts removed in this vote.\n\nThe code went through extensive testing, internal QA and external audits like https://code4rena.com/contests/2022-09-fei-and-tribe-redemption-contest.\n  ",

      "title": "TIP-121c: Final Redemption",
      "content": "This is a non-binding snapshot vote to build consensus on the final step of TIP-121, the Final Redemption.\n\nThere are 3 major components to Final Redemption:\n1. FEI backed 1:1 by DAI with zero fees\n2. TRIBE redeems pro rata of remaining PCV\n3. Revoking Governance powers for immutability\n\nThis proposal is structured to discuss only steps 1 and 2. \n\nStep 3 to Revoke Governance can be completed after all prior components of TIP-121 have been verified and holistically reviewed for security.\n\nThe proposal to redeem TRIBE pro rata has one main blocker from Consolidation, namely the OTC of veBAL for 1M DAI with the Aave Companies. There is no estimated execution time for this, because Aave wants to due diligence the escrow contract.\n\nThis presents an option for the DAO to consider:\n1. “Start Redemption” - Give TRIBE holders the option to claim pro rata early, excluding the 1M DAI from veBAL OTC \n2. “Wait” - Wait an unknown period for the veBAL OTC before TRIBE redeems pro rata.\n\nTo give more color to “Start Redemption”, this would be an improvement over “Wait” in the sense that no TRIBE holder is required to claim as the redemption window would be open indefinitely. A holder who wanted part of the DAI associated with veBAL OTC can wait for the 1M DAI in order to have a full pro-rata claim. Those who prefer claiming early would forego the claim on the last 1M DAI in exchange for early redemption against the remaining PCV. The remaining PCV includes over 21M DAI, 50k stETH along with remaining liquid gov tokens.\n\n“Start Redemption” can likely be proposed on-chain this week (with redemptions live as soon as executed), versus “Wait” which has an indeterminate timeline.\n\nIn a “Wait” scenario for TRIBE redemptions, the FEI backing 1:1 with DAI can still execute on chain beforehand.\n\n## Voting Rules\n\nThis proposal has 3 voting options, approval style with a 10M TRIBE quorum:\n1. Yes: “Start Redemption”\n2. Yes: “Wait” on OTC\n3. More Discussions\n\nEither of the “Yes” options are Yes for the entire Final Redemption, and the specific winning option determines when to bring TRIBE Redemption to an on-chain vote. The entire Final Redemption includes:\n1. FEI backed 1:1 by DAI with zero fees\n2. TRIBE redeems pro rata of remaining PCV\n3. Revoking Governance powers for immutability\n\nIf a Yes option wins, the corresponding on-chain votes would be proposed as soon as they are audited and completed development.\n",

      "content": "This is the non-binding snapshot vote for the Fuse Hack Payment part of TIP-121. (TIP-121b)\n\nThe mechanism for payment would be an exchange of cTokens from affected pools for FEI via trustless smart contract. The value of the FEI would equal the bad debt (effective losses) of each address at the specific block from roughly 24 hours before the DAO vote for Fuse Hack Payment. The price of non-usd pegged assets (ETH and RAI) would use a 7 day Time Weighted Average Price (TWAP) ending at that same specific block, for the purposes of calculating the total bad debt.\n\nThere are 4 options in the vote, each corresponding to how much to use for payment:\n- 57.3M TRIBE\n- 82.3M TRIBE and $4.6M USD of stablecoins\n- Full payment\n- No payment\n\nAny addresses which received payment from insurance such as Nexus Mutual would be  excluded from payment. \n\nIf options 1 or 2 wins, and an address has broken up their balances to seem smaller, these splits will also not be included and instead the original aggregated account will be used.\n\nThe EOA (user owned non-smart contract) addresses would need to sign and assent to a release waiver of liability to all TRIBE holders and Tribe DAO contributors in order to claim payment. \n\nAny smart contract addresses which are Gnosis safes will have funds sent directly to the safes. This is because smart contracts are incapable of on or off-chain signatures on a technical level. Known DAOs can coordinate with the Tribe DAO to come up with a suitable address for funds to be sent to.\n\n— \n### Voting Rules\nThis is a non-binding approval style vote. The most approved option would be submitted for a yes/no DAO vote after the completion of security audits and test deployments. Any DAO vote would be announced 72 hours in advance.\n",

We can then have a subsequent snapshot next week to decide how to treat each specifically.\n\nIf “sell stETH” passes, due to liquidity constraints there should be a subsequent discussion on execution parameters such as a floor sale price relative to ETH and expected timelines.\n\nETH and LUSD would use a 2-day Balancer LBP sale into DAI. Withdrawing protocol FEI would use a “withdraw as much as possible when liquidity available” algorithm.\n\n## Voting rules:\nThis is a non-binding multiple-choice signal vote. Each of the binary keep/sell pairs above would be included. The larger option which also reaches 10M TRIBE quorum would proceed as outlined in the snapshot proposal.\n",

The terms of this partnership were:\n\na $2m DAO swap\nOlympus to take in FEI as a reserve asset\nFEI to take in OHM as a reserve asset, at a rate of 20% Olympus’ FEI holdings\nThe DAO swap was executed 3 on March 22, $2m worth of each token based on a 30-day moving average (as stated in the proposal).\n\nOlympus executed 2 a $50m purchase of FEI through the FEI-DAI PSM on May 12 at the urgent request of the FEI team due to concerns over FEI’s peg.\n\nA snapshot proposal ([FIP-107 3] was posted on May 21 and passed on May 24, recognizing the $10m obligation and assigning ETH as the asset to convert.\n\nOn June 13, it was made clear to Olympus contributors through a call with Tribe contributors that the $10m LBP would not occur due to changing views of PCV within the Tribe community (with a heightened emphasis on stablecoin reserves). This was met with understanding and taken in stride by the Olympus community.\n\nAt this point, the partnership was considered to be delayed indefinitely. Olympus unwound its FEI exposure between 6/14 and 6/17, swapping $50m FEI for $49.95m DAI through the FEI-DAI PSM.\n\nFEI Protocol reimbursed the $50k PSM fee on 6/29.\n\nProposal\nOur final step in concluding this saga is to unwind the TRIBE<>gOHM DAO swap. Tribe currently holds 577 gOHM [here 5], while Olympus holds 3,753,510 TRIBE [here 2]. Tribe contributors have requested a vote from you, the Tribe, to complete this final step.",

This DAO vote will only transfer any unvested Fei Labs tokens to the DAO and move TRIBE from the DAO timelock to the treasury, with no actions related to TIP-121.\n\n  There are two timelocks of such unvested tokens of note, the TRIBE timelock which has 88909000000000000000000000 (~88.9M) unvested TRIBE and the FEI-TRIBE LP Timelock which has 132453262024125114893965413 (~132.4M) unvested LP tokens. The end date for the vesting used is July 1, 2022. All of these tokens will be returned to the DAO by granting ownership of the timelocks to the DAO. The DAO could claim the tokens from the timelocks as needed or simply account for them as not in circulation.\n\n  Note the LP Timelock includes a portion 23996686013920804984559112 (~24M) LP tokens which are locked for Fei Labs early supporters. These will be transferred to a new timelock and remain as liquidity, after returning the team’s unvested LP tokens to the DAO.\n\n  The FEI-TRIBE LP Tokens which return to the DAO would be broken up into FEI, which would be burned, and TRIBE, which would be sent to the treasury. The benefit of breaking up these LP tokens is having certainty on the number of TRIBE in the treasury and FEI removed from circulation for accounting purposes. \n  ",

It also pauses the the associated PCV drip controllers and \n  deprecates the Fei skimmers. Going forward, the only active PSM will be the DAI PSM.\n\n  The DAI FEI skimmer is also activated by granting the PCV_CONTROLLER_ROLE and excess FEI burned. \n  \n  In addition, a new type of PCV deposit, the ERC20HoldingPCVDeposit, is deployed. This is a deposit which has \n  the deposit() method as a no-op and is intended to just hold assets. The DAO's gOHM and VOLT assets are transferred\n  from the DAO timelock to the relevant holding deposits.\n\n\n  TIP-109: Deprecate TRIBE Incentives system (https://tribe.fei.money/t/tip-109-discontinue-tribe-incentives/4291)\n  --------------------------------------------\n  The proposal finishes the deprecation of the TRIBE incentives system by withdrawing the excess TRIBE from \n  the incentives system and deprecating the Tribal Chief contract. \n\n  Specifically it:\n  - Withdraws remaining TRIBE from the TribalChief, leaving enough behind to fully fund existing commitments\n  - Withdraws all TRIBE from 3Crv and D3 Votium briber contracts\n  - Withdraws remaining TRIBE from ERC20 Dripper\n  - Revokes no longer needed TRIBAL_CHIEF_ADMIN_ROLE roles\n\n  TIP-110: Simply PCV, specifically the agEUR & Angle redemption (https://tribe.fei.money/t/tip-110-simplify-pcv/4323)\n  -----------------------------------------------\n  Convert all agEUR in the PCV to DAI, and deprecate all Angle Protocol-related contracts, except the contract that is holding vote-escrowed ANGLE.\n\n  This proposal will perform the following actions :\n  - Move all ANGLE rewards to TC Multisig where they can be sold\n  - Unstake from Angle Protocol's Gauge all agEUR/FEI Uniswap tokens\n  - Move all agEUR/FEI Uniswap tokens to PCV deposit\n  - Remove all agEUR/FEI Uniswap liquidity & burn FEI\n  - Redeem agEUR for DAI, and send proceeds to DAI PSM\n  - Unset agEUR safe addresses & CR oracle entries\n\n  Additional cleanup items:\n  ----------------------------\n  - Transfers the admin of the Aave Tribe Incentives Controller Proxy to Aave Governance\n  - Claim 23k AURA airdrop and lock it for 16 weeks to avoid 30% penalty\n  ",

      "content": "TIP-117: Oracles, Roles, and OA Cleanup\n\n  This proposal performs various technical maintenance, cleanup and deprecation tasks. It also completes tasks from \n  TIP-110 (https://tribe.fei.money/t/tip-110-simplify-pcv/4323) and deprecates the optimistic approval and ops timelocks, which as of\n  FIP-82: Governance Enhancements (https://tribe.fei.money/t/fip-82-governance-enhancements/3945) are no longer required.\n\n  Specifically, it:\n1. Deprecates old collaterization oracle caching Features :\n    - collateralizationOracle is now read directly by pcvEquityMinter (buybacks) and tribeReserveStabilizer (backstop)\n    - collateralizationOracleWrapper and collateralizationOracleWrapperImpl are no longer used anywhere in the system\n    - collateralizationOracleGuardian (used to update the cache) is no longer used (revoked ORACLE_ADMIN_ROLE role)\n    - collateralizationOracleKeeper (used to incentivize updates of the cache) is no longer used (revoked MINTER_ROLE role)\n\n2. Removes empty or deprecated PCV deposits from the collaterization oracle:\n    - DPI->DAI LBP swapper lenses\n    - B.AMM LUSD Deposit (deprecated, would need to redeploy to use the new B.AMM)\n    - Fuse pool 7 (Tetranode) LUSD deposit (0$ left)\n    - Fuse pool 6, 19, and 24 FEI deposit (114$, 0$, and 6k$ left)\n    - DAO Timelock lenses for agEUR and WETH\n    - Curve/Convex d3 deposits (0$ left)\n    - Withdraw remaining ETH/FEI liquidity from Uniswap v2 (0$ left)\n    - Aave/Compound FEI/ETH deposits (0$ left)\n    - Balancer FEI/WETH deposit (0$ left)\n\n3. Unsets deprecated contracts from the safe addresses list, so funds can no longer be transferred to these deprecated\n   contracts by the PCV Guardian\n\n4. Implements components of TIP-110 Simplify PCV (https://tribe.fei.money/t/tip-110-simplify-pcv/4323):\n - Move LM rewards (COMP, stkAAVE, CRV, CVX) to the TC Multisig where they can be sold.\n - Move leftover RAI that is in PSM to the TC Multisig where it can be sold.\n - Move LQTY to TC Timelock where it can be moved to a proper PCVDeposit later.\n\n5. Deprecates the optimistic approval timelock by removing its various access roles. \n   This is cleanup from FIP-82: Governance Enhancements (https://tribe.fei.money/t/fip-82-governance-enhancements/3945),\n   the optimistic approval timelock is no longer required.\n\n   The following roles are removed:\n      - ORACLE_ADMIN ROLE\n      - SWAP_ADMIN_ROLE\n      - FUSE_ADMIN\n      - PCV_GUARDIAN_ADMIN_ROLE\n      - METAGOVERNANCE_GAUGE_ADMIN\n      - PCV_MINOR_PARAM_ROLE\n      - TOKEMAK_DEPOSIT_ADMIN_ROLE\n\n 6. Deprecates the ops optimistic timelock, which as of FIP-82: Governance Enhancements (https://tribe.fei.money/t/fip-82-governance-enhancements/3945), \n    is no longer required. The following roles are removed:\n      - METAGOVERNANCE_TOKEN_STAKING\n      - METAGOVERNANCE_VOTE_ADMIN\n      - METAGOVERNANCE_TOKEN_STAKING\n",

If any tokens remain in the contract after repayment, they can be withdrawn back into PCV.\n  \n  In terms of timelines, it would take 1-2 days to repay assets in PCV, and up to a week to source the non PCV assets from proposal execution.  \n  \n  Voting options are YES, whitelist the fuse repayment contract and begin immediate full repayment, and NO, do not whitelist the fuse repayment contract and begin immediate full repayment.",

      "title": "Implementation of Safesnap for FEI",
      "content": "As a relatively new investor in FEI, I am really surprised at the valuation of $Tribe. PCV for the protocol is $408 million, yet real circulating mc stands at $113 million. Even fully diluted, the mc is $250 million, still $150 million away from the real value of Fei's PCV and its intrinsic value. OHM, which doesn't have a cap on tokens in circulation, still trades at about a 35% premium to its total value in the reserve. At this same valuation, $Tribe would be worth $.6, or more than twice as much as it is valued currently. \n\nThis does not make sense and means, in my opinion, that currently, investors do not actually see $Tribe as a proper governance token. This could be due to misunderstanding, such as concerns about Algo stablecoins in general after the fall of Terra and of the market in general, but this issue should be affecting other major DAO tokens such as OHM yet it appears to be a unique issue with FEI when it comes to this bizarre crisis of confidence.\n\nFrom what I have seen, there has never been a time where a feasible snapshot has not been implemented after passing with a majority of support from Tribe holders. To cement the fact that the $Tribe token is a governance token just like any other and should be valued as such, I think it would be beneficial to implement the Safesnap module by sanpshot/Gnosis which is already being implemented into major projects such as Yearn Finance, Balancer, mStable, PoolTogether, dHedge, Stakewise, EPNS and Gnosis's own Gnosis DAO. \n\nThis module would take a while and would likely either require forking of the Gnosis contract or transfer of PCV to a vault which is run under the Safesnap guidelines, where snapshot decisions can be binding without using on chain transactions.\n\nThis would create instant value for Tribe users, and I think movement towards a system where Safesnap's code is implemented or some other code making governance decisions binding is done would be incredibly beneficial to the community.

      "content": "# Summary\n\nThis proposal would approve a FEI Savings Rate (FSR) on FEI held by Volt Protocol. The FSR would take effect immediately upon passing of this Snapshot vote.\n\nForum discussion : https://tribe.fei.money/t/fip-105-fei-savings-rate-for-volt/4220\n\n## Detail\n\nAuthorize the Tribal Council or Treasury Pod as relevant to distribute a 3% FSR to Volt Protocol on a monthly basis as described in the forum post, within five days of the end of the calendar month, based on Volt's average FEI holdings over the month.\n\nOnce a VOLT-FEI Balancer pool is ready, direct 20% of veBAL voting weight to this pool. This may be adjusted upward to at most 50% by the Tribal Council or relevant pod. While the forum proposal suggests a 50-50 pool weighting, this and other pool details may be altered subject to the approval of the Tribal Council or relevant pod.\n\nOnce Volt DAO begins receiving BAL rewards, swap these for TRIBE on a monthly basis, with Tribe DAO receiving a 20% discount on the BAL.\n\nVolt DAO commits not to deploy any PCV FEI into venues that create peg pressure, such as Aave or other lending markets, while contractionary monetary policy is in effect. The VOLT-FEI Balancer pool is expected to act as a FEI supply sink.\n",

      "title": "FIP-100: LUSD Liquidation Sentinel",
      "content": "# Motivation\n\nThere are a variety of reasons for the protocol to increase its DAI holdings in the short term. In addition to DAI being the main asset used by FEI’s current peg mechanism, many upcoming FEI initiatives could increase the protocol’s need for DAI (see the four reasons listed [here](https://tribe.fei.money/t/fip-99-sell-rai/4120)).\n\nFei Protocol has the ability to use all of its DAI, LUSD, ETH to support the FEI peg through PSM contracts. Only the FEI-DAI PSM is currently activated because this allows FEI to utilize DAI’s very tight peg for highly efficient peg maintenance. Unlike the FEI-DAI PSM, the FEI-LUSD and FEI-ETH PSMs rely on oracles that suffer from possible precision issues and MEV-sandwiching issues.\n\nRather than using the FEI-LUSD PSM, it would be more efficient to convert LUSD to DAI as needed. Under current market conditions the protocol can do this on-chain with deep liquidity + low slippage on Curve.\n\nThis can be performed in an automated fashion using sentinels 2. Sentinels are automated tasks that can be set to perform various PCV maintenance operations when certain conditions are met. Combined with the PCV collateralization oracle that tracks all PCV deposits on-chain, a sentinel can be triggered to act when assets balances cross some threshold. Here the sentinel would be activated to liquidate LUSD for DAI when DAI reserves fall too low.\n\n# Specification\n\nCreate a PCV sentinel with the following parameters:\n\n- Whenever the PCV has less than 5M DAI remaining, liquidate 5M LUSD for DAI on Curve\n- Revert the transaction if the realized price is < 99.5% of the LUSD-USD Chainlink oracle price\n- Revert the transaction if the realized price is < 0.995 LUSD per DAI\n- Ratelimit this operation to once per hour",

      "title": "FIP-101: Borrow DAI on AAVE",
      "content": "# Motivation\n\nThere are a variety of reasons for the protocol to increase its DAI holdings in the short term. In addition to DAI being the main asset used by FEI’s current peg mechanism, many upcoming FEI initiatives could increase the protocol’s need for DAI (see the four reasons listed here).\n\nOne attractive route for the protocol to achieve this is to take out a DAI loan on Maker, Aave, or Compound. Here are some currently available loans:\n\n- Aave: borrow DAI @ ~4% APY, FEI as collateral (min CR=154%)\n- Aave: borrow DAI @ ~4% APY, ETH as collateral (min CR=122%)\n- Compound: borrow DAI @ ~4% APY, ETH as collateral (min CR=122%)\n- Maker: borrow DAI @ 0.5%, ETH as collateral (min CR=170%)\n- Maker: borrow DAI @ 2.25%, ETH as collateral (min CR=145%)\n- Maker: borrow DAI @ 4%, ETH as collateral (min CR=130%)\n- Maker: borrow DAI @ 2.25%, wstETH as collateral (min CR=160%)\n\nThese APYs are variable over time, this just shows their approximate recent rates.\n\nSome relevant factors for Fei protocol include:\n\n- Volatile vs stable collateral: Lends collateralized by volatile collateral requires babysitting. This can be undesirable when all on-chain protocol operations need to be automated, and governance has a >1 week turnaround time.\n- Opportunity cost: The cost of taking out this loan includes not only the borrow APY rate, but also any reduction in yield that results from placing the PCV collateral into the lending platform.\n- FEI vs non-FEI collateral: Related to opportunity cost, it is significantly easier for the protocol to use FEI as collateral, either minting it directly or reallocating from other places.\n\nBased on these factors, the most attractive loan listed above would be borrowing DAI on Aave collateralized by FEI. The protocol also already has $16.42M FEI deposited on Aave. This is enough to collateralize a $10M DAI loan.\n\nAnother route to increase protocol DAI holdings is by reallocating PCV assets. This is also being pursued in other proposals. The reason that loans are attractive compared to merely liquidating PCV assets is that it is desirable to maintain exposure to some assets (e.g. ETH), some assets earn high yield (e.g. LUSD), and some assets relate to strategic partnerships (e.g. BAL).\n\n# Specification\n\n- Mint and Deposit $5M additional FEI into Aave to form a safety buffer, bringing total protocol holdings on Aave to 21.42M $FEI\n- Borrow $10M DAI and place into main DAI PCV deposit.",

      "title": "FIP 103: Native risk-free FEI interest rate starting at 3%",
      "content": "# Summary\n\nLet the community decide on a native risk-free interest rate.\n\nUpdate April 26th, 2022: Moving to a FIP process after a first poll. The majority vote was 3% FSR.\n\n# Motivation\n\nIn the road to 1B FEI 3, one main idea was to provide a native risk-free interest rate. This would be a simple stacking contract where Tribe governance decide the rate. A wrapper, ibFEI (or any other name), on top of it could provide a ERC20 compliant token (and most likely ERC-4626 compliant).\n\nSuch a decision will have many implications:\n- Fei will enjoy better supply rates at lending protocol supporting the risk free rate. Currently non-lent FEI sit idle. With a 67% utilization rate and a 3% borrow rate, this lead to a 2% supply rate. If we provide a 2% risk free rate, it would keep the 3% borrow rate but give a 2.67% supply rate narrowing the supply/borrow spread.\n- Fei could become a key stablecoin for Dex pairs. Dex could integrate the risk-free rate internally or use ibFEI as the stablecoin and have a front-end making the wrap/unwrap. 1inch for instance already does that for DAI/CHAI (but with 1bps rate, no one cares).\n- This could be integrated by exchanges, making a use case for listing FEI.\n\n# Specification\n\nCreate a FEI stacking contract with the following parameters:\n- FEI are minted and added to the stacking contract according to a rate.\n- The FEI Saving Rate can be updated.\n- An initial cap of 100M is used and can be updated later.",

      "content": "# Abstract\n\n- Move all PCV RAI to AAVE\n- Activate a price-bound, non-custodial, zero-fee, sell-only RAI-FEI PSM with a price threshold of $3.00\n\n# Summary\n\nSell RAI to replenish DAI reserves and/or relieve upcoming peg pressure\nMotivation\n\nMany upcoming initiatives will either increase the FEI supply or apply some pressure to the FEI-DAI psm peg mechanism:\n\n    Launch of Turbo\n    FEI-DAI PSM fee reduction\n    VOLT protocol FEI reserve deposits into Fuse\n    Boosted Balancer Pools depositing into Fuse\n\nThis is fine from a collateral backing perspective, as the PCV is still much larger than the amount of user FEI in circulation. The peg mechanism itself requires DAI though, and it’s likely that the protocol needs to either rebalance some of its assets into DAI or create matching buy pressure for FEI.\n\nTRIBE’s RAI is not as productive as other assets such as ETH and LUSD. Liquidating it for FEI would create some FEI buy pressure without liquidating these more productive assets. This would either earn the protocol DAI directly if the FEI is purchased through the FEI-DAI PSM, or it would create a FEI liquidity buffer if purchased from 3rd-party dexes.\n# Specification\n\nThere are many ways this could be done, including LBPs, DEX trades, PSM’s, and bonding curves. There are also many trade-offs, including slippage, time sensitivity, developer resources, and minimizing undesirable effects such as slippage, MEV sandwiching, RAI peg pressure, and Soros/Whale attacks.\n\nA solution that navigates these tradeoffs is liquidating the RAI through a price-bound, non-custodial, zero-fee, sell-only RAI-FEI PSM:\n\n    Being “price-bound” means that the PSM will shut-off if the price falls below some threshold. If the RAI peg breaks for some reason, trading will stop.\n\n    Being “non-custodial” means the PCV RAI would be sitting in Aave until it is pulled out on demand to be swapped for FEI, minimizing opportunity cost.\n\n    Being “zero-fee” means there is no fee for conversion, anyone can directly convert FEI→RAI at the current Chainlink RAI-USD oracle price. This will make it so the liquidations will happen relatively soon rather than over an extended period of time.\n\n    Being “sell-only” means the PSM will only convert its RAI to FEI, and not the other way around.\n\nAdditionally, the current PCV RAI in Fuse ($10M) worth would be moved to Aave, as a non-custodial PSM can only draw from a single source.\n\nAs for choosing an appropriate price threshold we can look at the historical price of RAI: [see chart in discussion thread]\n\nBased on this data I believe $3.00 would be a good price threshold, as it would allow for RAI to slip a small amount while still letting the trade progress swiftly. As an additional charter of this FIP, we can say that if the RAI price falls below this price threshold for 48 hours, then this price bound can be lowered in $0.005 increments down to $2.99 by the Optimistic Approval crew’s Operations Timelock.",

      "content": "#### Summary:\nConduct an approval Snapshot vote to elect 9 Tribal Council members through the proposed process.\n\n#### Motivation:\nWith the FIP-82 Snapshot already having passed the vote, the process can now move forward to the next step, which is the election of the 9 Tribal Council members.\n\nThis election will be managed by the community members and Discord Admins DioDionysos and meertitan, to ensure a neutral election process. The Tribe is moving towards true decentralization, by having the DAO elect community members for this powerful position.\n\nOptimistic Approval will be deprecated and replaced with the Tribal Council and Snapshot requirements will be removed in favor of making it easier for the community to veto. The Tribal Council will be initially a 5 of 9 multisig, and membership should come from the community, Fei core team, and Rari infrastructure with no group representing enough to reach quorum.\n\n#### Specification:\nAfter this Snapshot vote, the 9 highest voted candidates will be elected to the Tribal Council.\n\n#### Voting rules:\nVoting will last until the 18th of April 11:59 PM PST.\nPlease remember that Snapshot votes can be changed, but not withdrawn until the end of the voting period.\n\nThis is an approval vote, if you are unsure about the definition of an approval vote, you can read more about it [here](https://electionscience.org/library/approval-voting/).\n\n#### Resources:\n[General information](https://tribe.fei.money/t/fip-96-tribal-council-election/4065)\n[Nomination thread](https://tribe.fei.money/t/tribal-council-nominations/4074)",

Bug bounties will be paid by the DAO and enforced by the Tribal Council. Per the governance structure implemented in FIP: 82 the DAO will always have the ability to veto any decisions made by the Tribal Council. \n\nIf any valid bug bounty is submitted, the Tribe DAO will pay the bounty in full to the owed party(s). The respective rewards per bounties are distributed according to the impact of the vulnerability. The Immunefi page has more details on the classification of each tier.\n\nhttps://immunefi.com/bounty/tribedao/\n\nVoting\nThis vote will use approval style voting and have the following three choices.\n\n1.

While the DAO has extensive security precautions, its relationship with the white hat community has been extraordinarily valuable. It is more important than ever to grow and maintain this robust relationship with the white hat community. This proposal intends to do so by creating a public mandate for the Tribe DAO to pay any valid bounty submitted through the Immunefi or directly to the DAO.\n\nSpecification\nIn the future if any valid bug bounty is submitted the Tribe DAO will pay the bounty in full to the owed party(s). The respective rewards per bounties are distributed according to the impact of the vulnerability. The Immunefi page has more details on the classification of each tier.\n\nhttps://immunefi.com/bounty/tribedao/\n\nThis proposal will also retroactively apply to the recent Fuse vulnerability found by Samczsun and others. If 2x of 1x is passed, it will apply to this bounty as well.\n\nVoting\n\nThis proposal will use multiple choice style voting. \n\nA. Create a mandate to payout 2x the proposed bounties and (2.2m for a crit) retroactively apply to Fuse bounty\nB. Create a mandate to pay 1x the proposed bounties (1.1m for a crit) and pay out the Fuse bounty\nC. More discussions needed\n\n\n\n",

      "title": "Governance House - Delegate INDEX for Metagovernance Voting",
      "content": "---\n\ntitle: Governance House - Delegate INDEX for Metagovernance Voting\nstatus: Discussion\nauthor: @Matthew_Graham\nCreated: 28-02-2022\n\n---\n\n# Simple Summary\n\nTribe DAO holds 100K of INDEX and to date, has participated in two Index Coop snapshot votes. The INDEX metagovernance voting influence is significantly underutilized by so many INDEX holders. This proposal presents the community with a fresh approach for how Tribe DAO can boost participation in Index Coop’s metagovernance votes.\n\nPlease do read the Index Coop forum post describing Governance HOuse as it will provide the much needed context to support the below proposal, [1].\n\n# Abstract\n\nGovernance House is a newly created subDAO of Index Coop and has been created to offer Metagovernance as a Service (MaaS) across DeFi, [1]. The vision for Governance House is to help solve the voter apathy problem by becoming a pro-ecosystem, trusted vote in DeFi that also works with communities to help implement improvement proposals. MaaS enables everyone the ability to progress an idea from ideology to on-chain implementation. With one caveat, the improvement proposal is welcomed by the receiving communities core team.\n\nGovernance House kindly asks the Tribe DAO community if they would like to be apart of Governance House and to show support for Governance House, by granting Governance House the ability to utilize the 100K of INDEX to participate in INDEX holders metagovernance votes plus IIPs that are specifically related to Governance House. All metagovernance votes relating to FEI or TRIBE, plus non Governance House related IIPs will be run through a snapshot for TRIBE holders to vote on. For any votes that fail to meet quorum, Governance House will vote on the communities behalf.\n\n# Motivation\n\nTo date, Tribe has participated in two Index Coop votes, [2]. The first vote related to listing FRAX on Aave V2 (AIP-29) which is a great testament to the character of Tribe DAO. The second vote was to ensure that Set Labs continues paying for the rebalancing costs of DPI which the Index Coop community greatly appreciates.\n\nFor many large governance token holders across DeFi, this is fairly typical behavior whereby voters only participate in votes that resonate within the community. Governance House is trying to solve voter apathy by providing an independent voice who will vote to support the ecosystem in an unbiased manner. To date, Index Coop’s Metagovernance Committee has largely performed this function and going forward it will be replaced by Governance House.\n\nWith the emergence of Governance House, the proposal power from within the DPI sett will be more widely used to support the implementation of change across DeFi. To date we have had strong traction with Aave and hopefully others follow suit soon. Previously Index Coop has done some of this, but now Governance House intends to enhance the reach and influence by making it a service with the ecosystem. The vision for Governance House is to become a collaboration hub, an industry leader that supports the growth of the ecosystem.\n\nGovernance House intends to enable those who delegate large holdings to Governance House to retain the ability to vote on key decisions with the holding. For Tribe DAO, all metagovernance votes relating to FEI and/or TRIBE will be processed via Tribe DAO’s snapshot. Whatever TRIBE holders choose, will be how the Governance House votes. For any votes that fail to meet quorum, Governance House will vote on the communities behalf. This is the change between how TRIBE holders currently vote and how Governance House proposes to operate going forward with the community's blessing.\n\nThe request here is to enable Matthew Graham who is a part of Governance House to vote in line with the above proposal as presented above, [3]. Do note Matthew Graham is also a TRIBE delegate and his voting history can be found on Tally, [4]. The INDEX delegation will need to be re-delegated to a Governance House wallet address, with a supporting ENS name of course, as they are currently delegated to a signer wallet that is on multiple multisigs. Pending feedback in the comments, I will update this post with a wallet address in due course.\n\nIn order to successfully utilize the metagovernance influence of Index Coop, Governance House must exceed the INDEX voting quorum. To date, several large INDEX holders have either delegated their INDEX or are in the process of delegating their INDEX to Governance House. By Tribe DAO endorsing the above proposal this will go a long way to ensuring Governance House will always meet quorum on the Index Coop metagovernance process which will continue as is uninterrupted by the Governance House proposal.\n\nIf Tribe DAO would like to delegate TRIBE votes to Governance House, please do mention this in the comments as Governance House would love to be a delegate within the Tribe community more so than what it already is when Index Coop enables voting on Tribe’s on and off chain votes.\n\nIt goes without saying, if there are any opportunities that arise for Governance House to help support the growth of the Tribe DAO community please do let us know. If a core member from Tribe DAO wants to join Governance House with the intent of helping out and facilitating Governance House helping Tribe DAO, please do reach out. At the time of writing there are two members/delegates of the Tribe community at Governance House, Matthew Graham and Austin Green, [5]. At the moment we have members from Aave, Llama, Index Coop and hopefully a few more big names soon. We would love to see TRIBE listed on Aave mainnet V2 market :)\n\n# Delegate\n\nIf Tribe DAO would like to delegate TRIBE votes to Governance House, with great appreciation, please delegate to the below address.\n\n`0xE8e98fBbE83428aa087b29E003858F69855B50AE`\n\n# Reference\n\n[1] https://gov.indexcoop.com/t/governance-house/4065\n[2] https://app.boardroom.info/voter/0xb647055A9915bF9c8021a684E175A353525b9890?protocol=indexCoop\n[3] https://twitter.com/Matthew_Graham_\n[4] https://www.tally.xyz/voter/profile/4PXDG1\n[5] https://www.tally.xyz/voter/profile/YJOE34\n\n# Vote\n\nApprove Governance House the ability to utilize the following amount of INDEX as outlined above. Please select one of the following:\n\nOption 1) - Delegate 100K INDEX to Governance House\nOption 2) - Delegate 60K INDEX to Governance House\nOption 3) - Delegate 0K INDEX to Governance House\n\nIf TRIBE holders should delegate TRIBE to Governance House to participate in TRIBE governance. Please select one of the following:\n\nOption 1) - 2M TRIBE delegation to Governance House\nOption 2) - 1M TRIBE delegation to Governance House\nOption 3) - 0M TRIBE delegation to Governance House\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",

      "content": "\n**Summary:**\nMore than 60% of the PCV ETH is allocated to liquid and low yield protocols, including 15k in TimeLock that doesn’t earn anything. Assuming the Tribe DAO wants to retain an overweight allocation to ETH, one quick strategy change could be to allocate a higher percentage of those assets to more illiquid protocols.\n\nIn the future, the Tribe DAO should evaluate staked ETH positions across the various options to optimize yield generation, security, liquidity and partnership potential. After these initial deployments in RocketPool and StakeWise, if all goes well and outside liquidity grows, moving some of the 49k stETH with Lido to higher yields and partnership opportunities should be considered.\n\n**Specification:**\n\n1. Move 5000 ETH from Timelock into Rocket Pool, earning 4.3% yield\n2. Move 7500 ETH from TimeLock into StakeWise, earning 4.6% yield [StakeWise is offering additional incentives to the Tribe DAO]\n3. Move 5000 stETH into the wstETH/rETH (RocketPool) Curve Pool, which would earn around 7-10% APR including CRV and CVX incentives. stETH yield accumulates within the wstETH token. This would conserve ETH position, provide better liquidity than Lido protocol, while earning a higher return.\n4. Move 2500 stETH from step 2 and 2500 ETH from timelock into the wstETH/sETH2 (StakeWise) Curve Pool, which would earn around 7-10% APR, including CRV and CVX incentives. The pool is not yet opened, but it will offer high incentives and the same risks as RocketPool Curve pool\n\n\n\n",

Curve LP for cvxCRV-CRV (cvxcrvCRV) at a 40% LTV and $20M cap\n3.  Curve LP for cvxFXS-FXS (cvxfxsCrv) at a 40% LTV and $20M cap\n4.  Curve LP for rETH-wstETH (rocketethwstethCrv) at a 60% LTV and $40M cap\n5.  Staked CVX (not to be confused with 16 week locked CVX) at a 50% LTV and $30M cap\n6.  Curve LP for sETH2-stETH (once available on Curve)\n7.  1000 ETH from the protocol\n\nAdd stETH to Tribe ETH Fuse Pool (Pool 146)\n\n**Motivation**\nAt the time of writing, there is approx. $1.5B TVL across Convex Staked CRV (cvxCRV), Curve LP for cvxCRV-CRV (cvxcrvCRV), Curve LP for cvxFXS-FXS (cvxfxsCrv), Curve LP for rETH-wstETH (rocketethwstethCrv), and Staked CVX that users may want to collateralize and borrow against.\n\nAdding ETH into Pool 156 allows users to borrow ETH against stETH and rETH Curve LP positions to create leveraged yield farming opportunities that can’t be liquidated. At time of writing, there are only 786 holders of wstETH but 53,560 holders of stETH. By only having wstETH in the Tribe ETH Fuse pool (Pool 146), we are adding friction as the user has to wrap their position before depositing.\n\nAdding stETH into this Tribe ETH Fuse pool (Pool 146) would allow holders of the rebasing token to use as collateral to borrow ETH.\n\n**Specification**\nWhitelisting new collateral on the Tribe Convex Fuse Pool (Pool 156) through OA.\n\nA DAO vote will also be created to seed ETH in Tribe Convex Fuse Pool (Pool 156).\n\nWhitelisting new collateral on the Tribe ETH Fuse Pool (Pool 146) through OA.\n\n**Voting**\nThe proposal will use approval style voting with the following options:\n* Add Convex Staked CRV\n* Do not add Convex Staked CRV\n* Add Curve LP cvxCRV-CRV\n* Do not add Curve LP cvxCRV-CRV\n* Add Curve LP cvxFXS-FXS\n* Do not add Curve LP cvxFXS-FXS\n* Add Curve LP rETH-wstETH\n* Do not add Curve LP rETH-wstETH\n* Add Staked CVX\n* Do not add Staked CVX\n* Add Curve LP for sETH2-stETH\n* Do not add Curve LP for sETH2-stETH\n* Add 1000 ETH\n* Do not add 1000 ETH\n* Add stETH\n* Do not add stETH",

      "title": "Extend Aave borrowing TRIBE Incentives for 6 more months",
      "content": "Forum: https://tribe.fei.money/t/extending-aave-tribe-incentives-for-fei-borrowing/3996\n\nUpdate:\nAfter carefully reviewing all the feedback from the forum and discord (FIP-87 - https://discord.com/channels/787417509136957450/951249005222965319) discussions, this is an updated proposal with two options for reducing current TRIBE rewards by 25% or 50% while extending them for another 6 months. Clearly, both sides of the argument to extend some incentives and remove them have merits, and while imperfect, this proposal pushes both Tribe DAO’s goals forward. Extending FEI’s presence prominently displayed on Aave markets while significantly reducing incentivization of undesired behaviors. Ultimately, Tribe DAO should continue to review and evaluate how to better optimize FEI’s positioning on Aave, Compound, and other lending platforms.\n\nSummary:\nAave is one of the most dominant lending/borrowing markets in DeFi, and having FEI as a prominent borrowable and collateral asset helps further fortify Fei’s position in the space. Success of the initial deployment of FEI was partly driven by a 4M TRIBE incentivization of borrowing over the past 6 months on Aave. These borrowing incentives will expire on March 23, 2022.\n\nIn addition to increased visibility and other benefits to the FEI ecosystem, the Tribe DAO generated 1.7M FEI in fees from the initial 50M FEI deployment on Aave, which has been reduced to 15M FEI during the recent contraction policy execution.\n\nAlso, the native stkAAVE incentives offered to the Tribe DAO last round were about 1% of the total stkAAVE incentives because FEI is about 1% of the volume right now. FEI will likely be offered a lower amount in the future if there is an extended period of non-incentivized lending/borrowing, especially when most other tokens on Aave are being incentivized.\n\nThis proposal is up to vote to add 2M or 3M TRIBE and the extension of incentives for another 6 months from 23 March 2022, ensuring ongoing lending and borrowing activities on Aave. This represents a 25% to 50% reduction in the current amount of incentives.\n\nMotivation: \nThere are many advantages to a strong presence on Aave, both as a borrowable and collateral asset, and the DAO should continue to explore and optimize the approach to grow this and other stronger partnerships. Also, low borrow rates mean that FEI will be borrowed and likely redeemed against PCV and if the borrow rate is lower than the PCV’s yield rate, then that could slow PCV growth.\n\nVoting Rules: \n\nYes, extend Aave incentives for 6 months at 25% reduction (3M TRIBE)\nYes, extend Aave incentives for 6 months at 50% reduction (2M TRIBE)\nNo, do not extend \n\n\nYes votes will be combined for decision on extending the incentives vs. No votes, and if the combined Yes vote prevails, the amount with higher amount of votes between the two Yes options will be selected for a subsequent on-chain vote. \n",

      "content": "## Summary\nEnhance DAO governance and participation through Liquid Representative Democracy. Under the proposed governance structure, a newly created Tribal Council made up of members of the Tribe DAO community will replace the existing Optimistic Approval process. Optimistic pods and a NopeDAO are also introduced via the governance proposal.\n\n## Forum discussion:\nThe full technical details of the motivation, proposal, and specification are available at: https://tribe.fei.money/t/fip-82-governance-enhancements/3945\n\n## Motivation\nDAO governance often suffers from voter apathy, lack of community context, and barriers to participation such as gas fees. At the same time, many votes are non-controversial by the time they reach on-chain voting, making the incentives to vote (and pay gas fees) misaligned with increased participation. The Tribe DAO is not immune to these common DAO problems. Optimistic Approval (OA) in its current form is often difficult to follow and can be a long process regardless of the importance of the matter. Even trivial governance actions go through a lengthy process of proposing a draft, last call, snapshot, and an optimistic timelock. This can mean over 8 days of governance to enact small and non-controversial proposals.\n\nThis proposal could greatly improve the governance experience by creating a Tribal Council to propose and approve governance actions, with a built-in negative consent time lock and a low veto threshold to easily veto any actions taken by the Tribal Council that are opposed by the “Nope DAO”. This potential governance change will also allow for specialized governance pods to form around specific DAO issues, will encourage transparency and community engagement on the protocol level, and empower TRIBE holders to more actively participate in governance.\n\n## Specification\nFull details are specified at: https://tribe.fei.money/t/fip-82-governance-enhancements/3945\n\n### Overview if passed:\n- Maintain the existing TRIBE DAO three-tier governance structure, but expand the Optimistic Approval and Guardian to accommodate Optimistic pods\n    - An Optimistic pod is an Orca pod with an optimistic timelock. An Orca Pod is essentially a Gnosis Safe with a membership layer.\n- The existing Optimistic Approval powers will devolve to the newly created Tribal Council while removing the snapshot requirements\n  - A committee will be elected by the DAO and become the Tribal Council. Initially, this will have 9 members, with a threshold of 5 on the Gnosis Safe.\n  - Membership of the committee will come from the TRIBE community and by vote of the TRIBE community.\n  - Tribe DAO is able to add and remove members of the Tribal Council at will through a vote of the full Tribe DAO.\n  - The Tribal Council will maintain optimistic control over lower clearance pods and is able to veto them, with the exception of the Guardian pod\n- Optimistic pods are introduced into governance protocol\n  - These pods can be created by Tribal Council to manage specific areas of the protocol\n- The Guardian pod will maintain limited powers to be used only in emergencies\n\nA NopeDAO is created to veto any proposal from the Tribal Council or an Optimistic Pod. Its only function is the veto\n- The NopeDAO has a lower threshold of 10M TRIBE to enact a veto and once reached, the veto will take place immediately without a timelock\n- The NopeDAO is not able to veto the TRIBE DAO (i.e. can only overrule the Tribal Council and specialized pods, not a full Tribe DAO vote).\n- Any proposal that is vetoed by the NopeDAO must then go through the DAO governance to be enacted.\n\nThe result is that Tribal Council, and yet-to-be-created specialized Pods, will be able to prioritize non-controversial matters while those matters that go to a full Tribe DAO vote will be important and ones that the community will want to focus on.\n\n## Voting:\nThe proposal will use simple choice voting. Voting options are:\n- Yes, approve the governance upgrade\n- No, more discussion is needed\n\nGiven the importance of this vote, this snapshot will remain open for 4 days and we encourage you to discuss this vote with fellow Tribe Holders.\n\n",

      "content": "**Summary:** \nForum post: https://tribe.fei.money/t/fei-deployment-strategy/3993\nThis proposal describes a more structured approach to PCV exposure to minting and deployment of FEI for various applications, such as Laa$, Turbo and yield-generating use cases. It also ends the FEI contractionary monetary policy and proposes an initial deployment strategy.\n\nThe Fei Labs team performed a baseline PCV Stress Analysis (https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RCsRrImGoMvrJrgonYjx4PjqRTGvoLIRFq6szrnA7tY/edit?usp=sharing). The analysis examined various market scenarios and characterized FEI’s on-chain liquidity depth. This analysis suggests that up to 104M FEI can be deployed across Turbo, Fuse Convex Farming, Arbitrum, Compound, Balancer Fuse Pool and Volt without significant risk to FEI’s peg or collateralization. Currently, there are 64M FEI in OA Timelock, as well as an additional 30M FEI from 50M FEI Laa$ allocation, and 10M FEI in Angle protocol that will be recovered, which could be utilized for a guarded reentry into expansionary PCV management mode.\n\nThis represents a fairly conservative position, which allows the Tribe DAO to effectively launch Turbo, add FEI liquidity to Arbitrum, provide additional borrowable funds on Compound, while continuing with Laa$ and further supporting Fuse pools.\nThese actions will allocate Tribe DAO up to 104M FEI to deploy across broadly supported initiatives, while adhering to the FEI minting policy recommendations.\n\n**Proposed deployment strategies:**\nTurbo: 40M FEI (estimated 5% APR): the initial deployment for 40M FEI, but with the planned expansion of Turbo to Aribtrum, Tribe DAO should pre-approve additional 10M FEI to be minted as needed\nDouble collateralized\n\n- Strengthen DAO-2-DAO partnerships\n- Increases Fuse TVL and FEI utility\n- Technical requirements:\nNothing new to develop (just whitelisting collaterals & setting their caps)\n\nCompound: 5M FEI\n\n- Blue chip lending platform\n- Visibility and utility for FEI\n- Technical requirements:\nNothing new to develop\n\nArbitrum: 10M FEI\n\n- Layer 2 presence and adoption\n- Technical requirements:\nNeed new contracts to interact with the Arbitrum L1ERC20Gateway (L1->L2)\nNeed new contracts to interact with the Arbitrum GatewayRouter 1 (L2->L1)\nNeed new contracts to propagate L1 PCV_CONTROLLER role to interact with contracts on L2 and handle PCV securely\n\nMinting FEI to Convex Fuse Pool: 10M FEI\n- Increases Fuse TVL\n- Increased FEI utility with long tail assets\n- Technical requirements:\nNothing new to develop\n\nLaa$ (20M FEI)\n\nExpected deployments:\n- SYN (estimated 9M)\n- NEAR (estimated 3M)\n- FOX (estimated 3M)\n- POOL (estimated 1M)\n- UMA (estimated 4M)\n\n\nVolt (12.4M FEI) \nTribe DAO incubated product\n- 10M FEI PSM backstop\n- 2.4M FEI for Volt LBP seed their initial liquidity\n\nBalancer Fuse Pool (5M FEI)\n- Strategic partnership with the Balancer DAO\n\n**Voting Rules**\n\nThis is a binding vote. Once approved, the OA can deploy up to 104M FEI in specified markets.\n\n\n \n \n\n",

That \n  contract has an upgrade mechanism managed by a ProxyAdmin contract. To participate in the next round\n  of Aave rewards there is a need to upgrade to a compatible incentives contract. \n\n  However currently, the owner of the ProxyAdmin contract is the old, deprecated timelock that the Fei DAO \n  used. Only the owner of the ProxyAdmin is able to upgrade a contract it manages. \n\n  Therefore, this FIP is being used to change the owner of the ProxyAdmin contract to the new Fei DAO timelock. To do this,\n  we have to temporarily switch the DAO timelock back to the old timelock and so this FIP comes in three stages:\n  a, b, c. \n\n  FIP 84a specifically changes the FEI DAO to point to and use the old timelock for migration purposes. It also\n  introduces redundancy onto the live sister Rari DAO by granting it's timelock the governor role. \n  It also revokes the governor role from the old, deprecated timelock.\n  ",

      "title": "FIP-78a: Meta-governance - ANGLE",
      "content": "Authors: @Eswak\n\n**Context**\n\nThe DAO currently holds 10M$ of agEUR (Euro stablecoin) paired with 10M$ of FEI in Uniswap. The DAO currently holds 160k ANGLE (85k$).\n\nAngle protocol is a stablecoin that issues an Euro stablecoin, agEUR. The agEUR token can be minted with various collaterals (DAI, USDC, FEI, FRAX), and EUR/USD volatility is hedged by allowing users to open leveraged positions on agEUR/FEI for instance.\n\nAngle recently changed their tokenomics to use Curve’s “ve model”.\n\n**Summary**\n\n- Move the DAO’s ANGLE tokens to a new Angle delegator contract\n- The ANGLE delegator contract does a snapshot delegation to a target address, and “plays the veToken game” (more details below).\n- The DAO and OA Timelock can change the veANGLE delegatee.\n- Initial delegatee of the protocol’s veANGLE tokens will be eswak.eth\n\n**Motivation**\n\nThe veANGLE tokens can be used to direct more incentives towards pools that contain FEI, so we should use it to increase FEI demand.\n\nA lot of protocols are moving to veToken models, so I think it’s interesting to validate that capacity of the TribeDAO on-chain with a relatively small position (20M$) and a relatively small governance power (85k$ veANGLE).\n\n**Specification**\n\nDelegatee of the protocol’s veANGLE tokens have to be an externally-owned account, because they need to be able to vote on Snapshot. For on-chain voting, the OA Timelock and the DAO will be able to use veANGLE to vote in Angle’s OZ governor. The delegation is only for snapshot voting.\n\nTo “play the veToken game”, the protocol will do the following :\n\n- Permanently lock ANGLE tokens to veANGLE. Locking is done for 4 years, and can be renewed anytime permissionlessly to avoid voting power decay, unless the contract is paused.\n- Have the capacity to stake tokens in Angle’s gauges (only PCV_CONTROLLER_ROLE can call this function).\n- Vote for gauge weights (DAO or OA Timelock).\n- Claim ANGLE rewards from gauges, and vote-lock them to veANGLE (permissionless).\n\nIf this snapshot vote passes, I will create a post on the Angle forums, so that our veANGLE delegator contract is whitelisted to vote-lock ANGLE for veANGLE (they have a similar smartwallet protection as Curve does).\n\nThe DAO proposal will include a migration of our LP tokens from their old staking contract to their new gauge system.\n\nVoting\nThe proposal will use simple choice voting. Voting options :\n\nYes, use ANGLE as described\nNo, more discussions needed",

      "content": "Summary\nUpdate FeiRari AP for FEI-3Crv to 1000 and supply cap to $250m before removing incentives on TribalChief.\n\n**Forum:** https://tribe.fei.money/t/update-on-fei-3crv-and-convex-farming-plans/3928\n\n## Motivation\nAfter FIP-66 1, FEI-3Crv will be receiving bribes on Curve. Likewise this pool has an increased A parameter which increases the effective liquidity depth and utilization. It will go to 100 from 10 by Feb 5, Curve.fi.\n\nThere is currently code under audit which will allow the protocol to farm CRV and CVX by plugging in user deposits from FeiRari to Convex. This is effectively a TRIBE exchange for liquidity and CRV and CVX emissions, far more attractive than vanilla liquidity mining. This will be transitioned over as soon as the audit is complete and fixes are in, if any per FIP-60.\n\nThe last action item of FIP-60 is to lower the AP from 1000 to 0 on the TribalChief. The main intention for lowering allocation was the lack of liquidity (resolved by A param increase) and lack of profitability (resolved by plugin).\n\nThere is over $175m in TVL currently incenvitivized by this 1000 AP which would need to find a new home.\n\n## Proposal\nAtomically transition the AP of FEI-3Crv on TribalChief to 0 AND on FeiRari up from 250 to 1000 along with a supply cap increase to $250m\n\n## Voting Rules\nThis is a binding, binary snapshot vote. Quorum is 10M TRIBE. If \"Yes\" wins, the proposal will be enacted via the Optimistic Timelock. If \"No\" wins, TribalChief allocation points for FEI-3Crv will still be sent to 0 per FIP-60.",

Delays in the governance rework have led to an undefined time period with no funding structure for OA. This proposal aims to properly fund OA, as a bridging solution until the governance update is in place and a proper funding system has been established.\n\n#### Specification:\nFund the OA multisig with 42,000 FEI as compensation for January and February.\n\nContinue to fund OA multisig with 42,000 FEI every two months until a long-term solution has been established.\n\n#### Voting rules:\nThis will be a single-choice vote lasting 2 days:\n\n- Approve the budget\n- Disapprove the budget\n- More discussion needed",

At the current protocol equity of ~300M, this is $1.15m of FEI being put into circulation per week.\n\n((300m * 0.2) / 52) = $1.15m\n\nAs protocol equity lowers, so too do the buybacks, so there does exist some amount of scaling within the system as protocol health increases or decreases.\n\n## Voting\n\n#### Voting is approval-style. You can select multiple options. The option with the highest result will be implemented.\n\n- Keep buybacks at 20% APR of protocol equity\n- Reduce buybacks to 10% APR of protocol equity\n- Reduce buybacks to 5% APR of protocol equity\n- Pause buybacks indefinitely",

      "content": "## Summary\nPeg FEI to DAI directly instead of an oracle in the PCV DAI redeemer\n\n## Motivation\nAn oracle-based solution is not optimal for the current FEI-DAI redeemer. Making FEI redeemable 1:1 with DAI would resolve this issue by not directly relying on an oracle during regular operation.\n\nThis is analogous to the Maker PSM, and essentially allows Fei Protocol to piggyback off of DAI's tight peg.\n\nCritically, Tribe holders collectively manage how to deploy DAI (currently compound) and when to sell or shut off redeemability.\n\nBecause the DAI reserves are empty, the protocol should set minting fees to 0 to begin accumulating as soon as FEI is over peg.\n\n## Specification\nCreate a new Peg Stability Module that uses a fixed price oracle and reverts if the DAI chainlink oracle price is outside of the acceptable bounds.\nLower Bound: $0.975\nUpper Bound: $1.025\nMint fee basis points at 0\nRedeem fee basis points at 10\nDeprecate DAI PriceBoundPSM\nKeep all other DAI PSM parameters the same in this new contract\n\n## Voting Rules\nThis is a non-binding, binary, single choice snapshot. Quorum is 10M TRIBE.\n\n- YES, create this new redeemability module that allows DAI to be redeemable for FEI 1:1 and deprecate current FEI/DAI redeemability\n- NO, leave DAI redeemability module as is\n\nIf this vote passes, this will need new smart contracts to be written and then submit an action to the DAO for an onchain vote.",

      "content": "Summary\nExclude the FeiRari pool from the FEI liquidity cuts involved in FIP-73.\n\nMotivation\nIn order to protect the FEI Peg, there has been support for contractionary monetary policy in order to increase demand for FEI. FIP-73 (https://snapshot.org/#/fei.eth/proposal/0x825420b492363969de1d728655904181d92df2984631a232533e6a86b2125ee3) takes several measures to enact this contractionary policy, but it has one major flaw. The issue with the current FIP-73 proposal is that it drains FEI borrowing liquidity from TRIBE holders, which reduces the utility of TRIBE.  This only slightly increases peg security, which is not worthwhile in exchange for de-prioritizing access to FEI liquidity for TRIBE holders. This proposal excludes the FeiRari pool from having its FEI liquidity removed.\n\nSpecification\nThis amendment replaces the text \"Withdraw FEI from Fuse positions until utilization is 80%\" with \"Withdraw FEI from Fuse positions until utilization is 80%, except for the FeiRari pool.\"\n\nVoting\nThis is a binding, binary snapshot vote. Quorum is 10M TRIBE.",

      "content": "## Summary: \nBegin “Contractionary Monetary Policy” for Fei Protocol with some FEI policy changes to bolster the FEI peg and protect PCV.\n\n## Motivation: \nThe recent ETH downturn has placed the protocol under stress. While the FEI peg remains stable, the majority of the protocol’s DAI reserves were used on stabilization. This peg pressure comes from both exogenous and endogenous demand drivers:\n* Arbitrage with secondary FEI liquidity, particularly FEI-ETH on UniV2\n* FEI redemptions by external FEI holders\n\nAll protocol-owned FEI increases the “leverage” of the protocol by expanding circulating FEI through lending markets or AMM liquidity. By reducing these deposits, the protocol can contract supply and drive FEI demand to return to a greater than or equal to $1 peg rather than slightly below as in the current state.\n\n## Proposal:\n* Moratorium on FEI minting and deployments from either the DAO or Optimistic Approval - only automated FEI minting for peg defense should be allowed until explicitly authorized by TRIBE holders to end the moratorium\n* Authorize the Security Guardian to:\n   * withdraw FEI incrementally from both volatile LP positions: FEI-ETH and FEI-DPI using PCV Guardian contract and sending assets to the DAO Timelock to await future DAO deployment. For FEI-ETH, withdrawal size will be constrained by oracle safety margins of Chainlink.\n   * withdraw FEI incrementally from Curve d3 pool using PCV guardian each time FEI falls below 1:1 relative to FRAX and alUSD\n   * withdraw FEI incrementally from Aave each time utilization falls below 90% back up to at most 90% utilization\n   * enable and refill PSMs as needed to defend peg using PCV Guardian contract\n* Begin further community discussions on additional actions to take to defend the peg and PCV\n\nNote that the Security Guardian is already authorized to act in extreme market conditions such as this per FIP-55, but this proposal serves as an explicit description of actions to be taken.\n\n## Voting Rules:\nVoting will be a binary, binding vote over 24 hours. The shortened time window is used due to the extreme market conditions. If the proposal is passing but not yet finalized, the Security Guardian may begin taking action if market conditions worsen. If passed, this will be enacted by the Security Guardian. Quorum is 10M TRIBE.\n",

      "title": "FIP-69: FEI/FOX Token Swap & Collaboration",
      "content": "Hello FEI/Rari Tribe -\n\nOn behalf of all of us at the DAO, congrats on your merger. We’re super excited to see what new doors this opens for both communities.\n\nHere at ShapeShift we’re very familiar with both platforms, having already plugged into their unique capabilities. On Rari, our FOX Token is available in both the Tetranode Pool and our own “Fox and Frens” pool. We recently used Rari to borrow FEI in order to fund our December payroll. Additionally, we’re a proud partner in the FEI liquidity-as-a-service (Laas) program and are currently tapped into a steady stream of TRIBE rewards in exchange for providing FOX liquidity.\n\nLooking ahead, we’re excited to collaborate even more closely with your newly-united TRIBE. To provide just one example: our decentralized, open-source interface could help your community connect with more users and offer them an improved experience by facilitating direct integrations with RARI pools. Similarly, the addition of FOX rewards to Rari pools could create a win-win for both projects; FOX would become more widely used and distributed, while simultaneously incentivizing greater use of Rari.\n\nFrom a tokenomics and treasury management perspective, our top priority is to diversify a portion of our treasury–which primarily consists of FOX–into stablecoins. (The current state of the treasury, including most of our active DeFi positions, can be viewed here: zapper dot fi/account/0x90A48D5CF7343B08dA12E067680B4C6dbfE551Be.\n\nGiven our existing relationships with the FEI/Rari communities, we’ve identified a promising way to achieve a portion of that desired stablecoin exposure (while at the same time, deepening our current win-win relationship): a DAO-to-DAO swap of FOX Token for FEI.\n\nFor ShapeShift, FEI’s price stability, vibrant community, expanding ecosystem, and RARI merger are highly desirable attributes. For FEI/RARI, potential benefits of this token swap include:\n\nTreasury diversification\nDirect integration into the ShapeShift platform\nThe ability to vote on DAO proposals (FOX is ShapeShift’s governance token)\nExposure to ShapeShift’s various value-accrual mechanisms:\nRevenue-sharing agreements with DeFi projects integrated into our platform, such as Yearn\nRevenues generated from commissions from validators operated on behalf of the DAO\nRevenues generated from allocating assets in the DAO’s treasury to DeFi strategies\nWhere we’re headed:\n\nThe roadmap for the ShapeShift DAO is ultimately driven by the community of FOX Token holders. Currently the community is aligned on–and rapidly progressing toward–the following mission and vision:\n\nVision: We envision a borderless financial system built on open, decentralized protocols.\n\nMission: We shall be the pathway into this borderless financial system; an open-source, multi-chain, self-custody crypto platform enabling billions to achieve financial sovereignty.\n\nAn early, in-progress version of the new ShapeShift is soft-launched at https app dot shapeshift dot com (sorry, the forum is only letting me post two links) and we’re planning an official launch for January 17th, 2022. This version is open-source, supports multiple wallets, multiple blockchains (not limited to EVM-compatible networks), and is architected for complete decentralization.\n\nThe new ShapeShift, powered by a full open-source stack including HDWallet , Unchained , Chain Adapters, and Web repositories, will enable completely decentralized access to DeFi protocols across any chain. Additionally, the upcoming FOX Chain will provide backend node infrastructure for any interface that wants to be truly decentralized, including ShapeShift’s.\n\nFinally, through integrations with DEX and DEX aggregator protocols such as 0x, THORChain, and Osmosis (in-progress), ShapeShift enables users to seamlessly move crypto assets across chains with no KYC, custody, nor added fees. With the understanding that both the decentralized interface and blockchain data infrastructure are imperative to bringing DeFi to the masses, the ShapeShift community is actively coordinating to build this.\n\nWhat exactly does this proposal entail?\n\n$XX million worth of FOX would be exchanged for $XX million worth of FEI, where “XX” would be determined in this vote. (Separately, ShapeShift is voting on approving a swap of to up to $10 million FOX for $10 million FEI.)\n\nThe price data used to determine the equivalent token quantities will be determined at a date and time that both DAO’s mutually agree upon in advance, with the Chainlink feed for the respective tokens providing the relevant price data. The two communities will mutually agree upon considering additional token swaps in the future, should this initial swap prove beneficial for TRIBE and ShapeShift.\n\nIn addition to executing its side of the DAO token swap, ShapeShift would commit to integrating Tribe products into its platform (initial discussions about this are already in the works), as well as adding FOX rewards to Rari pools.\n\nUltimately, we view this potential token swap as just one more building block for constructing a solid, enduring foundation of partnership and collaboration between both of these vibrant DAO’s. We look forward to joining you in helping to build a more inclusive, open, permissionless, and vibrant future.",

      "title": "FIP-68: Finalize Fei-Rari Merge",
      "content": "Status: Snapshot Voting\n\nAuthors: @JackL\n\nForum Post: https://tribe.fei.money/t/fip-68-finalize-fei-rari-merge/3877\n\nSummary\n\nFinalize Fei-Rari merge by repaying the REPT-B debt, setting an expiration date of August 1st at midnight GMT for the RGT to TRIBE swap, and ending the RGT Sushiswap rewards.\n\nMotivation\n\nThe Fei-Rari merge promised a full repayment of the REPT-B debt within 90 days of the merge being executed. Now that we are a few weeks into the merge of both teams within the Tribe DAO, I would like to propose that we use a peg swap for REPT-B to FEI. Joey has written the code for this transaction and it will include REPT-B holders both on Ethereum and on Loopring. The repaying of the debt has already been approved, now we are determining and confirming the delivery method of these payments. \n\nThe merge also outlined the swap for RGT to TRIBE and gave a window of at least 180 days for token holders to do so. We are currently working on code that would allow for a fRGT to fTRIBE migration (for Fuse users in pools that share both assets). There will be a series of announcements prior to this migration happening. I propose that we set an expiration date for the swap of RGT to TRIBE using the exchange rate outlined in the merger of 26.7:1 to end on August 1, 2022 at midnight GMT.\n\nThe Rari Capital DAO is currently incentivizing liquidity on Sushi as outlined in RIP-2 (RIP-2 Discussion - Rari Governance Forums 3). Now that the merge is complete, I propose that we sunset this program as the DAO is continuing to spend resources on a liquidity incentive program that is meaningless with RGT not being utilized anymore. I believe It’s important to leave enough RGT for 1 more week of rewards if this vote passes. This will ensure that all current Sushi LPs are properly incentivized and have the ability to claim rewards. Disclosure: If this pool begins to decline in liquidity, it will affect the Chainlink feed and TWAPs that use the RGT price as an oracle.\n\nSpecification\n\nCreate a hard stop for the RGT to TRIBE migration of August 1st at midnight GMT, which is at least 6 months from now.\n\nDeploy the code necessary to allow REPT-B holders to redeem for FEI.\n\nEnd Sushi Pool2 rewards program.\n\nVoting Options\n\nThe proposal will be a yes/no vote for both proposals. The voting options will be as follows:\n\n1) “YES pay the REPT-B debt. NO, discuss alternatives.”\nIf a NO, we will begin discussions on the forums again to determine a better delivery plan.\n\n2) “YES, end the swap period in August. NO, don’t do anything.”\nIf No, the swap period will last indefinitely and will not have a finalized ending period for the exchange rate. \n\n3) “YES, immediately stop Sushi incentives. NO, don’t do anything.”\nIf NO, RGT emissions will remain on Sushi.\n\nVoting Rules\n\nNon-binding signaling Snapshot vote. The options which pass both 10M TRIBE quorum and >50% approval will be enacted",

      "title": "FIP-67 Backup LUSD Redeemability",
      "content": "Author: @elliot\nStatus: Last Call\nWith input by: @joey; @storm\n\n## Summary\nCreate an additional redeemability module denominated in LUSD. This module will be fully paused and will not be unpaused unless redemption demand increases significantly. The guardian, governor and OA will be able to unpause the LUSD redeemability module and will do so if there is enough redemption demand.\n\n## Specification\nDeploy a fully paused redeemability module with the following parameters:\n\n   - LUSD as the external asset\n   - 50 basis point fee for redemptions and minting\n   - Reserve Threshold of 10m LUSD, any amount of LUSD over that can be sent to another deposit\n   - Buffer cap of 10m FEI (max amount of mintable FEI a single tx can take)\n   - Buffer refills at 10k FEI per second\n   - 0 incentive for keepers on the PCVDripController\n   - 5m LUSD per drip, once every 30 minutes\n   - Unpauseable by the guardian, governor and OA\n\n## Motivation\nAs FEI is a fully asset backed stablecoin, the protocol should be prepared for redemptions whenever they occur. Currently, the only way to sell FEI back to the protocol is through the DAI redeemability module. There is an ETH redeemability module, but it only mints FEI in exchange for ETH and does not allow redemptions of ETH for FEI.\n\nThis proposal aims to create a paused redeemability module denominated in LUSD so that the protocol can buy back FEI with its large reserve of LUSD if there are large amounts of redemptions. The reason for going live in a paused state is because there currently is not enough redemption demand to warrant opening this module up. However, if redemption demand changes, the redeemability module will be unpaused by the guardian or OA.",

Up until the merger, contributors have been compensated in RGT. In Joey’s initial post to the Rari Capital community (FeiRari Token Merge - Rari Governance Forums 3), he proposed the following long-term payment plan that would provide more structure to contributor compensation.\n\n“Establish a joint task force to build cross-protocol integrations and keep long term roadmap alignment, and provide additional treasury resources for the existing Rari Infrastructure Task Force, 6M TRIBE and 6M FEI to vest linearly over 3 years.”\n\nUnfortunately this element of the merge was left out on the Snapshot and the on-chain DAO vote, which is why I am revisiting this topic and proposing it once more.\n\nMODIFICATION MADE ON FORUMS:\nLENGTH: 2 YEARS\nTRIBE AMOUNT: 4,000,000\nFEI AMOUNT: 4,000,000\nAny unvested tokens can be clawed back on-chain at any point during this timeframe. \n\nhttps://tribe.fei.money/t/fip-63-infrastructure-team-funding/3855/10\n\nMotivation\n\nAs the infrastructure team grows and expands, I would like to revisit the conversation that was once had in the original proposal.

      "content": "## Summary:\nAdjust TribalChief rewards to go directly to the FeiRari Fuse pool and include new incentivized assets in the pool.\n\n## Motivation:\nAfter the FeiRari merger 7, we should look to deploy assets and incentives into Fuse wherever possible. One recommendation I’ve had for new DAOs is to use Fuse as their main rewards distribution platform because of how configurable and composable it is. Not to mention, it is incredibly useful for users to have capital efficiency on their reward positions for borrowing and leverage.\n\nThe goal of this proposal is to transition existing rewards and future rewards to the FeiRari pool wherever possible. This benefits both users and the protocol in many ways:\n* Users get borrowable liquidity against yield positions\n* Protocol gets FEI utilization + fees\n\nWe can even set up a “bond” like structure where the deposited tokens are redeposited through plugins to earn other protocol tokens for Fei Protocol. The prime example of this would be a CVX plugin where Fei pays out TRIBE for d3 token liquidity in Fuse and gets to keep any CRV/CVX yield it earns.\n\n## Proposal:\nAdd the following pools to FeiRari with TribalChief rewards:\n\n* G-UNI FEI-DAI\n* FEI-3CRV\n* Any approved rewards from FIP-59\n\nThe rewards for new pools can be sent straight to FeiRari, whereas old pools may either use a plugin for backward compatibility or change-over.\n\nThese will have LTV of 60% and supply caps of 25m to be increased as they fill up with demand.\n\n## Voting Rules:\nThis is a binding, binary snapshot vote. The result will be enacted by Optimistic Approval. Quorum is 10M TRIBE.",

      "content": "## Summary:\nAdjust TribalChief rewards away from FEI-TRIBE liquidity and FEI-3Crv towards Uniswap USDC-FEI 1bps tier and d3 pool.\n\n## Motivation/Background\n### FEI/TRIBE LP tokens\n25% of FEI/TRIBE liquidity (amounting to ~$87MM) is currently staked in the TribalChief contract earning 47% APR. The remaining 75% (amounting to ~$271MM) is owned by Fei Labs core team and investors, subject to a 1 year cliff and 3 year linear vesting, and custodied by the IDO contract.\n\n$1.32 | Uniswap FEI/TRIBE LP (UNI-V2) Token Tracker | Etherscan 2 The trading volume on the Uniswap v2 FEI/TRIBE pool is de minimis. At current TRIBE prices, TRIBE holders are paying $112,000 per day to increase the size of the Uniswap pool from $271MM to $358MM, which results in marginally lower price impact.\n\nhttps://v2.info.uniswap.org/pair/0x9928e4046d7c6513326ccea028cd3e7a91c7590a 1\nThis proposal removes TribalChief incentives for this pool, which will increase the value of our other incentive programs proportionally.\n\n### Fei / Stablecoin Liquidity\nThis Curve metapool is doing very little volume in part because it is not being seen by aggregators like 1inch and Paraswap, and because of the existence of concentrated Uniswap liquidity:\n-incentivized Fei/Dai .05% Gelato LP with $18MM TVL, and\n-unincentivized FEI/USDC Uniswap liquidity with $33.75MM TVL\n\nThese two pools combined are averaging ~$70MM daily volume recently with a combined 100 AP, whereas the Curve pool is doing far less volume with 1000 AP.\n\n## Voting Rules\nThis is a binding vote, with the result to be enacted by Optimistic Approval. The options are \"approval style\" with the most approved option in each category being the winner:\n\nRemove FEI/TRIBE Uniswap LP incentives (1000 → 0 AP)\na. Gradually over 2 weeks\nb. All at once\nc. Do not remove\n\nIncentivize FEI/USDC Uniswap v3 LP 1bps\na. 250 AP\nb. 500 AP\nc. Do not incentivize\n\nReduce 3CRV/FEI incentives\na. 250 AP\nb. 500 AP\nb. Do not reduce\n\nIncentivize Curve d3 pool\na. 100 AP\nb. 250 AP\nc. Do not incentivize",

      "title": "FIP-57: Guidelines for DAO governance",
      "content": "Forum Discussion: \n\nhttps://tribe.fei.money/t/fip-57-guidelines-for-dao-governance-procedures/3751\n\nMotivation:\nIn light of the recent controversies due to confusions over the governance process, I’d like to propose some governance guideline practices to ensure that future governance votes would proceed in an orderly manner that is satisfactory to everyone. \n\nhttps://docs.fei.money/governance/fei-improvement-proposals-fips is the currently standing rules of FEI governance, This proposal is meant to supplement the above proposal and incorporate some of the best long standing practices observed by the community. This proposal is meant to aggregate and codify the best of such practices and it is meant to serve as a reference for the future combined TRIBE DAO as well. Since TRIBE DAO is still in its early stages, these draft measures, if approved, are meant to serve as “official governance guidelines” rather than immutable “written laws” for the future operation of the DAO.\n\nProposal:\n\n1. All forum proposals should engage in a 48 hour (as described in the original FIP document) last call before proceeding to snapshot. The last call should be announced in the discord governance channel for publicity; enlisting the aid of a mod if need be.\n\nA notable exception would be technical rollouts, or routine contract upgrades such as FIP-48, which can be forwarded straight to On-Chain voting/OA timelock if there are no dissensions. Other measures which are already approved in principle by a DAO vote such as individual LaaS funding, can be allowed to move forward directly to OA/snapshot.\n\n2. During the “Last Call”, each FIP should clearly state what every voting option would be. The last call post should also indicate any edits which have been made from the original due to the discussions in the forum. If the proposal is significantly amended during last call, the author should respect the flow of the discussion and delay the snapshot accordingly.\n\nAn exception can be carved out for proposals that see no dissensions or edits from the original document. In which case the last call is simply a 48 hour countdown announcement. \n\n3. Only the author(s) of the original forum discussion post should make the snapshot for that particular motion, or allow somebody else to do so with explicit written permission in that original thread.\n\n4. Upon the passing of a snapshot vote, the poster should announce in their original discourse post, or on discord governance, the specific time they intend to forward the proposal for on-chain voting/Optimistic Approval. If a particular snapshot is a “temperature check” and not meant to be executed directly, it should be clearly indicated by its authors. \n\nRoutine protocol upgrades can be exempt from these requirements.\n\n5. If a proposal outright fails, the author should indicate whether they intend to repost the FIP after editing its contents with community input. A failed FIP should go through the entire process of a new FIP, including another last call, etc. \n\n6. If a proposal passes, but the authors feel that an edit to its contents are merited before proceeding with onchain voting/OA; the authors should clearly indicate so as soon as possible. The authors should clearly outline every edit from the proposal that has passed the snapshot. This is particularly relevant for the Fei-Rari merge snapshot, and I encourage the community to comment on needed changes for the Fei-Rari merges.\n\n7. The DAO guardian should be able to veto existing votes if they satisfy the following criteria:\n- The proposer or payload is unknown.\n- Proposal which distributes PCV or incentives to voters on the basis of their vote (bribery proposals)\n- Proposals which add admin control to untrusted accounts\n- Any veto authorized by a TRIBE snapshot that reaches quorum and has at least 24 hours duration (mostly applicable to OA)\n- A proposal which contains a security vulnerability, either disclosed by core team or community member, and verified by any third party such as audit firms, security researcher, or community members. \n…………………..\n\nIf successfully passed on snapshot, these guidelines would be pinned on the discourse forum and written into the snapshot website for Fei. They would serve as official guidelines for the governance process.\n\nProposals that blatantly disregards these guidelines should be rapidly informed as such by community members. If the authors do not respond to valid inquiries of procedure, and outright circumvents governance practices, the proposal could be subject to sanctions such as non execution by OA approval, or veto by guardian/DAO. \n \n\n",

      "content": "#### Forum Discussion:\nhttps://tribe.fei.money/t/fip-xx-fei-grants-program-batch-2-budget-proposal/3763\n\n#### Authors:\nArcology, DioDionysos, meertitan\n\n#### Summary:\nFund Batch #2 of the Fei Grants Program via the DAO treasury.\n\n#### Motivation:\nArcology, DioDionysos and meertitan have been managing the Fei Grants Program in collaboration with Sebastian for the pilot Batch #1, funded by Fei Labs. The Grants Committee has a developed a track record in the past Batch through funding and assisting many projects, such as:\n\n- __[Llama DAO](https://twitter.com/FeiGrants/status/1471182077966094337)__ (providing financial reporting data for the Fei DAO) ($119,500)\n- __[Crypto Kailash Substack](https://cryptokailash.substack.com/)__ (increasing recognition of Fei Protocol’s mechanisms) ($10,000)\n- __[CVc’s analysis](https://dune.xyz/kelvinaddr/Fei-Activity-Analysis)__ (an analytics dashboard tracking key metrics of Fei Protocol) ($10,000)\n\nFor more details on our work on Batch #1, check out the __[Batch #1 retrospective](https://medium.com/@feigrants/end-of-the-pilot-32b8f9dc5756)__ and our __[Fei Grants Program landing page](https://aromatic-grouse-e85.notion.site/Fei-Grants-Program-9373df863bb54b389ebcd516780d7975)__.\n\nAs the DAO matures, decentralization is becoming a higher priority, with the Grants program being no exception. Given the circumstances, the Fei Grants Committee is requesting more independence in their management of the Fei Grants Program, with the intention of fully transferring control of management and Grants review within the DAO, with Fei Labs in an advisory role.\n\nAt this juncture, the Grants Committee will adopt a more proactive stance on seeking and recruiting talent, drawing more and better quality contributors to build for Fei. As such, one strategy is to leverage our in-person networks and reach out to institutes of higher education and professional blockchain associations to source such talent.\n\n#### Specification:\nTo continue with the next Batch of the Grants Program, the Committee hereby requests a working budget of 250,000 FEI, in line with the previous Batch #1 budget. This funding is intended to last for 3 months, the proposed duration of the next Batch. \nWe are also requesting an additional 10,000 FEI for any operational expenses from the Grants Committee, including but not limited to: gas costs, local and regional professional/enthusiast blockchain memberships, participation in universities and associated events for hunting down high value prospective Grantees and projects; web-domain upkeep costs and potential marketing endeavors. All such costs will be recorded and reported for transparency. This brings the total budget to 260,000 FEI. \n\nAny funds unused at the end of the Batch will be returned to the DAO. Any budget overage during this Batch will be identified, with any consequent funding top-ups to be brought before Governance.\n\nApproved Grants will be paid out from this budget, using a 2 out of 3 Gnosis multisig made up of the Fei Grants Committee members (arcology, DioDionysos, meertitan). The multisig will have a 96 hour OA period vetoable by the DAO/guardian for payments.\nPreviously approved Grants from Batch #1 will continue to be paid out by the Batch #1 budget set by Fei Labs.\n\n#### Voting rules:\nVoting will last 2 days. \nPlease remember that snapshot votes can be changed, but not withdrawn until the end of the voting period. \n\nThe 3 voting options are: \n\n- Approve starting the Fei DAO Grants Program with a Batch #2 budget of - 260,000 FEI\n- Don’t approve FEI DAO Grants Program mandate and initial Batch #2 budget\n- More discussion needed\n\n---\n#### Resources:\n- __[Official Fei Grants page](https://aromatic-grouse-e85.notion.site/Fei-Grants-Program-9373df863bb54b389ebcd516780d7975)__\n- __[Fei Grants Twitter](https://twitter.com/FeiGrants)__\n- __[Fei Grants Medium](https://medium.com/@feigrants)__\n---",

      "content": "## Forum discussion\nhttps://tribe.fei.money/t/fip-56-fei-v2-deployment-proposal/3768\n\n## Summary\nOn December 15, pending governance approval, the following features will go live for DAO vote:\n\n* TribeMinter with rate limit\n* TRIBE Backstop\n* DAI redeemability contract\n\n## TribeMinter\nEnhances access control around TRIBE minting and rate limits supply expansion to 100% inflation per year at the extreme. The true inflation will likely be far below this and could be negative if buybacks exceed backstop + minting.\n\n## TRIBE Backstop \nThe Tribe backstop is a contract that allows holders to exchange FEI for newly minted TRIBE when the collateralization ratio is under the threshold. The exchange rate will be 1:1 at the oracle reported price for TRIBE in USD. The initial collateralization ratio threshold will be 100%. This can be raised or lowered by governance in the future.\n\nThe backstop includes an “Oracle Security Module” similar to MakerDAO where the collateralization ratio needs to be continuously below the threshold for a certain period before the backstop is open for usage. The proposed window is 24 hours. This is in place to further minimize backstop usage in the event of near threshold collateralization and sharp market volatility.\n\n## DAI Redeemability\nThe first redeemability contract proposed is DAI. This will allow users or arbitrage bots to swap FEI for DAI at $1 according to the oracle price with a small fee.\n\nThe DAI redeemability contract will have a “Price Bound” mechanism which automatically shuts down redeemability if DAI trades outside a supported range. This saves the PCV in the event of DAI completely losing its peg. The proposed initial bounds are $.95 and $1.05.\n\nRedeemability contracts refill their own reserves by pulling from other PCV contracts periodically. The DAI redeemability will have a dripper attached to the Compound DAI PCV Deposit with a frequency of 30 minutes and a size of 5m.\n\n## Additional parameter changes\nIncrease ETH reserve stabilizer and bonding curve spread to 75bps\n\nDAI spread at 50bps to be lowered when we lowered within 2 weeks to 25 bps\n\nDAI buffer starts at 20m and lowers to 10m within 2 weeks.\n\nAdd DAI redeemability as a “Safe” address for the PCV Guardian to send funds to.\n\n## Voting Rules\nThis is a non-binding single-choice vote. Quorum is 10M TRIBE. There are 3 options:\n* Yes, implement v2 as proposed\n* No, do not implement v2\n* More discussions\n\nIf Yes passes, the proposed implementation will be submitted to the DAO on Dec 15 around 12pm PT.\n\n",

      "content": "Motivation\n\nThe current Ragequit Mechanism has design flaws that increase the complexity of the code, relies too much on the CollateralizationOracle, and exposes the PCV to risks from ETH volatility. \n\nSummary\n\nThis is an amendment to FIP-51 (Improperly titled FIP-XX): Amended FeiRari Merger Proposal. Make the following changes to Section IV-III:\n\nOne hour low water mark removed and replaced with hard-coded Ragequit price.\nSpecifies that the Ragequit contract will be open immediately after the execution of the Fei DAO vote.\nFixes a typo in the calculation of Intrinsic Value.\n\nSpecification\n\nReplace Sections IV-III D-F of FIP-51: Amended FeiRari Merger Proposal with the following text:\n\nD. Starting immediately after the execution of the Fei DAO vote, the Ragequit contract will be open for deposits of Tribe for three (3) consecutive calendar days; at the end of those three (3) days, any qualified actor will be able to call a function that redeems deposited Tribe for newly minted FEI at the Ragequit price as defined in Section F.\n\nE. The Intrinsic Value of TRIBE tokens is determined by the total Protocol Equity (VIII.C) divided by the pre-merger TRIBE Circulating Supply (VIII.D). The Protocol Equity number is taken from Fei’s Collateralization Oracle.\n\nF.  The Ragequit price is determined by the Intrinsic Value of TRIBE 1 hour before the DAO vote. The Ragequit price will be hard-coded.\n\nLinks\n\nFIP-51\n\nhttps://snapshot.fei.money/#/proposal/0x3ff3e641c682d5d6d8b6945c33ee3d13fe24cd129a1f7ce7da6a83fa57a5a725\n",

      "content": "Summary\nShift 100M USD of ETH from Compound and AAVE PCV Deposits to stETH, all TOKE + equivalent ETH to TOKE-ETH Uniswap Pool, all LUSD to the LUSD stability pool, all RAI + equivalent DAI to Uni v3 LP, and burn all FEI in Kashi.\nMotivation\nThe Curve stETH-ETH pair has 5B worth of liquidity. stETH is a highly liquid asset, and appropriate to add to the treasury. Currently the entire recommended stETH allocation can be sold with <0.08% slippage.\nThe TOKE-ETH pool on Uniswap is a better strategy decision than single-sided TOKE, as it forces pairing with ETH and has a far higher APY of 160%. Single-sided TOKE is actually at risk as in later Tokemak versions it will be used for TOKE-voted pairings, which are riskier than the TOKE-ETH pairing. We propose to shift our TOKE rewards as well as an equivalent amount of ETH to TOKE-ETH, and slowly phase out the single sided ETH pool.\nMoving 90M LUSD to the stability pool grants 13% APY. The stability pool is extremely safe, and grants a high level of yield to our LUSD funds.\nMoving 10M LUSD to Fuse Pool 7 allows us to start an LUSD lending market for Fuse, and this also synergizes well with the upcoming Stability Pool + Fuse Product.\nThe RAI/DAI Uni v3 LP is incentivized by Reflexer Labs with 48% APY. Due to being a stablecoin pair, there is little to no risk of capital loss. The pool offers a far higher APY than Compound DAI deposits. (I’d appreciate if a dev weighed on on the automation of v3)\nLending deployments on Sushiswap’s Kashi makes less than 1.5k per year currently, lower than the capital risk of deploying 8m on a third-party smart contract. Burning the FEI on Kashi eliminates this smart contract risk, with little profit lost.\nSpecification\n\nShift 50M USD of ETH from Compound PCV Deposit to stETH\nImprovement from 0.10% to 4.92%~ APY\nShift 50M USD of ETH from AAVE PCV Deposit to stETH\nImprovement from 0.30% (Including stkAAVE rewards) to 4.92%~ APY\n\nShift all TOKE Single-sided ETH rewards to TOKE-ETH, as well as an equivalent amount of ETH.\nImprovement from 4% to 160% APY.\n\nMove 90M LUSD to the stability pool.\nImprovement from 0% to 13% APY.\n\nMove 10M LUSD to Fuse pool 7.\n\nMove all RAI as well as an equivalent amount of DAI to the Uniswap v3 pool.\nImprovement from 1.5% APY to 48% APY.\n\nBurn all Kashi FEI\n",

      "content": "## Forum:\nhttps://tribe.fei.money/t/fip-54-permanently-deprecate-burner/3743\n\n## Summary:\nPermanently deprecate the Burner role and transfer hooks, removing the ability for the FEI to be burned arbitrarily (can only be burned by owner).\n\n## Motivation:\nThe Burner role allows the Fei DAO to burn FEI from any address. This is a lot of power, and was required for direct incentives. Since direct incentives are no longer a feature of Fei Protocol, it would be appropriate to remove this power from governance. It has been raised as a concern on the MakerDAO and Compound forums that this role exists.\n\nIn addition, the DAO can add arbitrary logic inside the transfer function, including fees and other checks. This is also too much power, and can increase gas costs and break fungibility for users. This should also be removed.\n\n## Proposal:\nReplace the core reference in the FEI token to a “Restricted Permissions” which only allows for minting and pausing minting via Guardian. This would permanently lock the contract’s ability to burn from any address. It preserves the ability for a user or contract to burn its own FEI.\n\n## Voting Rules\nNon-binding signal vote with 10M TRIBE quorum. There are two options:\n\nYes, revoke burning\nNo, don't revoke burning\n\nIf yes wins, it will be submitted for on-chain governance",

      "content": "**Summary**\nEnter a strategic partnership with Volt Protocol and receive 6% of the VCON governance token supply. Provide liquidity support for Volt's launch as well as long term cooperation and involvement in VCON governance.\n\n**Details**\nVolt has identified Fuse as a primary mechanism for enhancing our initial liquidity. We will use a “VOLT Stable Swap Pool” that accepts exclusively VOLT as collateral and allows users to borrow other stable assets at affordable rates.\n\nGiven that FIP-39 has authorized up to $1m FEI for any verified Fuse pool, I feel $10m is a reasonable allocation for the Volt Stable Swap pool. Fei will be able to earn yield lending against VOLT, and we will be able to “piggyback” off the deeper FEI liquidity.\n\nIn the future, we hope to see Volt onboarded as part of Fei’s PCV, once a mutually agreed upon threshold of liquidity and history of price stability has been met. We can continue to discuss this and confirm plans in a future proposal.\n\nLikewise, Volt Protocol will plan to incorporate Fei as part of its “surplus buffer”/PCV raised as part of an Olympus Pro bonding program. The form this takes will be confirmed in the future, and may include VOLT/FEI LP shares, fFEI from the Volt Stable Swap Pool, or other relevant asset.\n\n**Specifics**\nAuthorize OA to deploy up to $10m FEI into the Volt Stable Swap Fuse pool, subject to this pool's configuration passing due diligence.\n\nCommit to develop a framework for onboarding VOLT as PCV including thresholds of price stability and liquidity as well as any other requirements. Any such plan subject to approval in a future proposal.\n\nReceive 6% of the VCON supply and embark on a long term partnership with Volt as a complementary offering in the decentralized credit stack.\n\n**Conclusion**\nIn the context of the likely Fei-Rari merger, there's an opportunity to build an ecosystem of products that's larger than the sum of its parts. I'm personally elated about the opportunity to become part of the Tribe. -- onetruekirk.eth",

      "content": "Summary\n\nGFX Labs has provided services during the groundbreaking FEI RARI DAO merger, including smart contract creation and associated simulations & tests, solicitation of community input, and creation of a merger-plan in PDF format summarizing deal terms and conditions. \n\nGFX Labs’ initially requested a payment amount equating to approximately 3.5 million USD, and has since re-proposed this with a timelock-vesting period of 2 years, linearly.\n\nThe terms proposed by GFX Labs have not achieved community consensus, but it is still necessary to come up with some amount of governance-agreed-upon compensation for the work provided - regardless and notwithstanding any potential future agreements to cooperate and work with the Tribe DAO.\n\nVote Calculations\n\nThe payout to GFX will be decided by this snapshot vote using a token-weighted sum to determine the final payout; the voting selection will include:\n\na. “No Payment”\nb. 50k FEI\nc. 100k FEI\nd. 333k FEI\ne. 1M FEI\nf. 2M FEI\ng. 3.5M FEI\n\nThe resulting payment will be calculated as the dot-product of the total number of each votes for each option by the list of options:\n\na(0) + b(50,000) + c(100,000) + d(333,000) + e(1,000,000) + f(2,000,000) + g(3,500,000)\n\n(where a-g are the proportions of votes for each respective compensation option)\n\nAs a simple illustration of this formula, imagine a scenario with three potential vote amounts: A, B, and C. Take the case in which these options receive 10%, 40%, and 50% of the votes respectively; the final payout would be calculated as 0.1*A + 0.4*B + 0.5*C.\n\nThis vote will be posted to both the TRIBE and RARI snapshots. The votes on both snapshots will be totaled to compute the numbers and proportions above, using the conversion factor of 1 RGT = 26.7056734303 TRIBE listed in the terms of the merger. This is important so that both TRIBE and RARI holders can have say on the size of the payment.\n\nIf the “No Payment” option receives more than 50% of the vote, then no payment will be given. Otherwise, “No Payment” is equivalent to “0”.\n\nScope and Execution\n\nPayment will be in FEI remitted from the Tribe Optimistic Approval multisig and is intended to be compensation for existing, completed work, and is not meant to be an indication of future collaboration. All additional compensation or long term arrangements between GFX and TRIBE are separate from this proposal.\n\nLinks\n\nAssociated Tribe Forum Post:\nhttps://tribe.fei.money/t/fip-xx-amended-fei-rari-merger-proposal-fip-xx-gfx-labs-compensation/3734\n\nAssociated Rari Forum Post:\nhttps://forums.rari.capital/d/186-amended-feirari-merger-proposal-gfx-labs-compensation\n\nOriginal GFX Labs Merger Proposal: https://gfxlabs.io/docs/draft_fei_rari_merger.pdf\n\nOriginal GFX Labs Smart Contract Code:\nhttps://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-fei",

      "content": "Summary\nShift 100M USD of ETH from Compound and AAVE PCV Deposits to stETH, and 20M USD of ETH from Compound and AAVE PCV deposits to Tokemak Single Sided ETH farming.\n\nMotivation\nETH yield is not being appropriately managed by the PCV, and this proposal seeks to increase yield on PCV assets in a safe fashion. At current APR, this proposal grows the estimated yield of the PCV by 6.4M~ USD per year.\n\nThe Curve stETH-ETH pair has 5.5B worth of liquidity. This marks stETH as being a highly liquid asset, and appropriate to add to the treasury. Currently the entire recommended stETH allocation can be sold with 0.76% slippage.\n\nTokemak is a newer DeFi protocol than stETH, and the TOKE token is less liquid and more unstable than ETH/stETH. As rewards for Tokemak farming are paid in the TOKE token, I recommend a smaller allocation for Tokemak. The farming rewards for one year can be sold for 1.8% slippage with current liquidity. As we are staking pure ETH, liquidity for the deposited token is not a concern. The additional TOKE also could allow the DAO to exercise more control over Tokemak, a possibly crucial DeFi primitive.\n\nSpecification\n\nShift 50M USD of ETH from Compound PCV Deposit to stETH\nImprovement from 0.10% to 5%~ APY\n50k → 2.5M Yield\n\nShift 50M USD of ETH from AAVE PCV Deposit to stETH\nImprovement from 0.30% (Including stkAAVE rewards) to 5%~ APY\n150k → 2.5M Yield\n\nShift 10M USD of ETH from Compound PCV deposit to Tokemak Single Sided ETH\nImprovement from 0.10% to 8.33%~ APY\n5K → 833K Yield\n\nShift 10M USD of ETH from AAVE PCV Deposit to Tokemak Single Sided ETH\nImprovement from 0.30% (Including stkAAVE rewards) to 8.33%~ APY\n30K → 833K Yield",

Matthew Graham will execute the TRIBE holders vote as the outcome of this Snapshot.\n\nIndex Coop Snapshot\nhttps://snapshot.org/#/index-coop.eth/proposal/0xc6b656f97240505912508f6a47ca0bf117732833da22817252d3c1c7100fcd69\n\nIndex Coop Forum Post\nhttps://gov.indexcoop.com/t/proposed-iip-113-index-coop-product-launch-maintenance-gas-costs/3277\n\nSee discord chat for discussion, feel free to ask questions :)\n\n# IIP-113: Index Coop Product Launch & Maintenance Gas Costs\nActive\nStatus: Proposed\nAuthor(s): @cavalier_eth, @dylan, @Finance.Nest\nCreated: 24th November 2021\nDiscussion to: https://gov.indexcoop.com/t/proposed-iip-113-index-coop-product-launch-maintenance-gas-costs/3277\nQuorum: 109,069 [2,181,385*0.05]\n\n# Simple Summary\nIndex Coop will maintain wallets used to pay gas costs for Index Coop product launches & product maintenance. Set Labs will utilize these wallets in the interim to perform product launch & maintenance work until the Index Coop is ready to own these operations.\n\n# Abstract\nSet Labs currently pays for most of Index Coop’s product launch & maintenance gas costs. As Index Coop transitions towards becoming an autonomous DAO, product launch costs, rebalancing and code base upgrades shall be passed from Set Labs to Index Coop. This proposal represents progression towards autonomy with Index Coop taking over financial responsibility for on-chain product costs.\n\n# Motivation\nThis IIP follows the forum post Product Performance - Surfacing Gas Costs.\n\nDuring the early months of Index Coop, there was no clear agreement on who would be liable for gas costs, and as the performers of rebalances and in the spirit of a startup, Set Labs bore those costs. In the months since, AUM and product maintenance costs have grown considerably, and Set wishes to pass these costs to Index Coop.\n\nIt is important to move these costs to the Index Coop. Set cannot pay for gas costs indefinitely and not having product maintenance costs borne by methodologists or Index Coop is distorting the profitability for Index Coop products.\n\n# Projected Gas Costs\nAverage monthly gas costs are expected to be around 60k - 80k USDC, with 20k - 30k USDC in Automated Index rebalancing expenses and 30k - 50k in Composite Index rebalancing expenses. In a month of high gas and price volatility, Automated Index rebalances can increase to 80k-90k on its own.\n\nFor a more detailed breakdown on the kinds of transactions incurring these gas costs and their susceptibility to low liquidity/high price volatility environments see the Product Performance - Surfacing Gas Costs forum post.\n\nimage\nGas costs in ETH terms for the previous 4 months\n\nimage\nGas costs in USDC terms for the previous 4 months\n\nThe above tables have been pulled from a more detailed analysis on total product gas costs. You can read that here.\n\n# Specification\nOverview\nTo launch Index Coop products, an EOA will be shared between Set & Index Coop. This EOA will be used for contract deployments of all Index Coop products.\n\nTo rebalance Index Coop products, multiple EOAs (eventually, one for each product) will be shared between Set & Index Coop. These wallets will be used strictly for conducting Index Coop product rebalances.\n\nIt will be the responsibility of EWG in conjunction with the Finance Nest Operations Account to ensure each wallet is sufficiently funded & ensure smooth launch & maintenance operations.\n\nFinance Nest will be responsible for auditing the costs & making these costs known to INDEX holders via it’s monthly Operations Account and Financial reports.\n\n# Rationale\nThe primary reason for managing one wallet per product is to prevent multiple products from being blocked by a single unmined transaction. If ETH2x-FLI submits a rebalance transaction with too low of a gas cost, it will block all subsequent rebalance transactions. Getting a single transaction unblocked alone requires some coordination. Having multiple product rebalances potentially blocked because they are all waiting for a single transaction to mine quickly multiplies complexity.\n\nWork has already been completed to separate ETH2x-FLI/BTC2x-FLI keeper rebalance wallets. Extending this wallet setup to Simple Indices infrastructure will help further scale the product rebalancing system.\n\nIn addition, managing one wallet per product simplifies accounting. Each product’s cost center is divided by wallet and easily auditable.\n\n# Voting\nFOR\n\nDO adopt the above wallet system for Index Coop product launch & maintenance.\n\nAGAINST\n\nDO NOT adopt the above wallet system for Index Coop product launch & maintenance.\n\n# Copyright\nCopyright and related rights waived via CC0.",

The allocation will represent 1.7% or 3.4% of Fei Treasury.\n\nWith this proposal, PCV will increase revenues without changing the risk profile and Fei will consolidate the relationship with the Idle community.\n\n### Motivation\nIdle DAO initiated the collaboration with Fei by developing [idleFEI Best-Yield strategy](https://idlefinance.medium.com/idle-fei-expanding-yield-optimization-across-capital-efficient-stablecoins-cf6011fd3056), which optimizes Fei returns across the market.\nTo foster the onboarding of Fei into the Idle family, Idle DAO activated [$IDLE liquidity mining on idleFEI](https://gov.idle.finance/t/enable-idle-liquidity-mining-on-idlefei/696), giving protocol ownership to Fei LPs.\n\nThis proposal introduces how Idle could also become a safe place to host part of the liquidity held in PCV, improving economic returns and getting a voting position in Idle Governance.\n\nLaunched in 2019, Idle proved to be secure and resilient over the years, with particular attention to security procedures, scalable infrastructure, and developing a friendly environment for risk-averse liquidity providers.\n\n*Security Due Diligence*\nDays of activity: 820 (2+ years)\nOverall protocol audits: [6](https://developers.idle.finance/security/audits)\nBug Bounty Program: [$500k](https://developers.idle.finance/security/bug-bounty)\nNexus Mutual coverage liquidity: [$40m](https://app.nexusmutual.io/cover) ($DAI and $USDT)\nGovernance: [Compound Governor Alpha](https://gov.idle.finance/t/community-governance-process/39)\nTVL: $125m\nHacks: 0\nLosses: $0\n\n*Economic analysis*\n7-month average APY for DAI: 11.32%\nThe table to compare APYs is reported in the [Forum Discussion](https://tribe.fei.money/t/fip-44-idle-protocol-as-yield-source-of-pcv-allocations/3622).\n\n### Voting Rules\nVoting will last 2 days.\n\nPlease remember that snapshot votes can be changed, but not withdrawn until the end of the voting period.\n\nThe 3 voting options are:\n* Allocate $20m in Idle\n* Allocate $40m in Idle\n* Do Nothing\n",

      "content": "Forum Thread\nhttps://tribe.fei.money/t/fip-43-tribe-reward-to-handle-fi-fuse-pool/3600\n\nSummary\n\nAllocate $TRIBE incentives to suppliers of $FOREX tokens in handle.fi 8 RARI FUSE Pool #72 (troopersGarage) to incentivise $FEI borrowing against $FOREX collateral. Handle are also allocating $FOREX incentives for $FEI suppliers to the pool. This will stimulate FEI circulation and diversify the community of governance token holders across both protocols.\n\nMotivation\n\nHandle is a decentralised multi currency stablecoin protocol allowing users to create and exchange multi-currency stablecoins as the global defi FX protocol for non-USD stables. $FOREX is the handle governance token.\n\nUsers of the handle.fi 8 protocol can:\n\n- settle trades in their local currency, removing foreign currency risks;\n- borrow against crypto assets in their local currency, reducing conversion fees and fx risks;\n- convert between multi currency stablecoins efficiently;\n- earn rewards for liquidity provision in trading and keeper pools in your local currency;\n- earn arbitrage profit from 1:1 redemptions; and\n- speculate on foreign exchange movements.\n\nHandle has completed an audit with PeckShield and recently launched on Arbitrum mainnet. There is now a key opportunity to partner with decentralised USD-stablecoin protocols to provide a gateway into non-USD stables and the handle community propose to work together with FEI DAO.\n\nHandle has a verified RARI FUSE Pool #72, troopersGarage, to allow the handle community of troopers to use $FOREX tokens as collateral to borrow against, and are currently allocating 10,000 $FOREX incentives per week to $FEI suppliers of this pool.\n\nThis proposal puts forward to the FEI DAO to allocate $TRIBE incentives to $FOREX suppliers to the pool. This will create shared incentives to increase the pool depth and increase $FEI circulation.\n\nBenefits to the FEI DAO Tribe:\n\nAdditional utility and returns for $FEI and rewards for $FEI holders\nStrategic partnership with handleDAO and a cross-pollination of the handle community of troopers with the FEI tribe\nAlignment with an emerging theme for non-USD stablecoins\n\nSpecification\n\nThis proposal would allocate 10 Allocation Points (AP) of the $TRIBE rewards system per week from the DAO treasury for rewards to RARI FUSE Pool #72 - troopersGarage.\n\n10AP $TRIBE tokens per week will be issued by FEI DAO to $FOREX suppliers to the pool.\n\nNoting that ~13,700 $FOREX tokens are currently being issued by handle to $FEI suppliers. These incentives are roughly equal in terms of financial value at current market prices for the respective tokens.",

      "content": "Forum Discussion: https://tribe.fei.money/t/fip-42-deposit-2m-fei-into-visor-finance/3568/4\n\n# Summary\nThe following is a proposal for a partnership between Fei Protocol and Visor Finance.\n\nFEI Optimistic Approval Multisig will send 2,000,000 FEI into Visor Finance for the FEI-USDC Uniswap v3 pool @ 0.05% fee tier on Mainnet.\n\n# Motivation\nThe proposal aims to generate yield on FEI DAO’s treasury assets using Visor Finance to facilitate the liquidity provisioning process. Concentrated liquidity provisioning on Uniswap v3 involves managing price ranges and manually re-investing earned fees. The advantage of using Visor Finance for this deployment is continual re-investment of fees. Price range adjustments and fee re-investments are done according to top-of-the-line strategies developed by Gamma Strategies, which is a research organization funded by Visor.\n\n# Risks\nProviding liquidity in a narrower price range can lead to earning higher fees, but can subject the liquidity provider to greater impermanent loss as prices of the underlying assets diverge. However, impermanent loss is not a concern for this initial deployment because it is a stable coin pair. Conversely, providing liquidity in a wider range will earn less fees than a narrower one, but are accordingly at lower risk of suffering impermanent losses when there is price divergence. See here for a calculator that allows you to explore how impermanent loss can be affected by the width of price ranges. https://defi-lab.xyz/uniswapv3simulator 1\n\nGamma Strategies aims to reduce the risks of impermanent loss through active range management. This may include widening the ranges during periods of high volatility and narrowing the ranges in periods of low volatility in order to maximize yield taking into consideration impermanent loss.\n\n# Specification\nFEI will be sent to the Visor position manager contract called the Hypervisor https://github.com/VisorFinance/hypervisor/blob/master/contracts/Hypervisor.sol, which will mint fungible ERC-20 LP tokens to a whitelisted address provided by FEI.\n\nFEI will be actively managed on the FEI-USDC pair on Uniswap v3 on Mainnet by the visor protocol. In the future, when the FEI-ETH pair picks up volume on Uniswap v3 and this pair becomes more profitable to LP, this FEI liquidity can be moved to that pool.\n\nOnly the whitelisted Optimistic Approval address provided by FEI will have the right to deposit / withdraw assets to and from the Hypervisors. The position manager contract has the right to a few functions which are to set base ranges, set limit ranges, collect fees, rebalance, and mint/burn LP tokens to the whitelisted address. Therefore, the Hypervisor contract has only management rights and is non-custodial in that only the provided whitelisted address may deposit / withdraw assets into and out of the contract.\n\nVisor Finance takes 10% of earned fees, which get distributed to VISR stakers. 90% of earned fees will be automatically re-invested into the LP positions. Visor Finance will cover all gas fees for rebalancing positions and re-investing earned fees.\n\nThis will be an OA action and will not go through the DAO.\n\n## OA Actions\n1. Send FEI to the Mainnet Hypervisor contract.\n2. Receive ERC-20 LP tokens for LP positions in the whitelisted Optimistic Approval address.",

This amount represents 8.5% of Fei PCV and 14% of LUSD total supply.\n\n# Motivation\nWith Liquity USD pegged stablecoin (LUSD), Fei can earn yield and better protect the $FEI peg.\n\nLending Stablecoins have scaling challenges as they depend on demand for leverage. However, in a crash scenario, liquidations help them to hold the peg when the market is deleveraging. Lending Stablecoins are a good fit for Reserve Stablecoins like FEI, helping the latter to protect the peg in extreme scenarios. \n\nLiquity  is a decentralized borrowing protocol that allows you to draw interest-free loans against ETH used as collateral. Loans are paid out in LUSD and need to maintain a minimum collateral ratio of 110%. In addition to the collateral, the loans are secured by a Stability Pool containing LUSD and by fellow borrowers collectively acting as guarantors of last resort.\n\nLUSD launched in April 2021, the current market cap is $710M and possesses a total collateral ratio of 290%. \n\nLiquity is governance-free and has multiple decentralized front-end interfaces giving it more resilience and censorship resistance. It is very aligned with Fei in relation to decentralization.\n\nBy depositing LUSD to the Stability Pool, Fei can earn LQTY rewards and liquidation gains (in ETH). The APR is currently at 29%. This is an estimate of the LQTY return on the LUSD deposited to the Stability Pool over the next year, not including the ETH gains from liquidations.\n\n# Specification\nAcquire 100M LUSD through a Balancer auction using minted FEI. It is a similar process to the one used for TRIBE buybacks. The acquired LUSD will be supplied to Liquity native stability pool.",

This has been proven by 112M worth of TRIBE being deposited into the Rari pool. However, TRIBE has a 15% lower LTV ratio than ETH, DAI, and FEI. Increasing this ratio to 80% provides additional utility to TRIBE holders and increases TRIBE buy pressure, offsetting LM (liquidity mining) costs.\n\nSpecification\n\nChange the LTV ratio on TRIBE in Rari Capital Fuse Pool #8 to 80%.",

This only included the minting of FEI, without any provisions for removing, or more granular instructions for which pools can be supported. With the recent launch of permissionless pools, many include FEI and this introduces some arbitrariness into which pools get seeded.\n\nRari Capital DAO holds snapshot votes to determine which DAOs and users get the whitelisted ability to create verified pools. This adds a layer of protection around fraudulent or immature pools for prospective users.\n\n[FIP-29](https://tribe.fei.money/t/fip-29-oa-multisig-updates/3514) granted Optimistic Approval power over the FeiRari pool, including the ability to add new assets and change parameters.\n\n## Proposal\nExpand FIP-13/29 charter to authorize OA to do the following:\n* Add any new FEI derivative to the FeiRari Fuse pool subject to:\n  * 5m Supply cap \n  * Sufficient on-chain liquidity at least 1x amount in Fuse\n  * A manipulation resistant oracle (e.g. Chainlink or Uniswap TWAPs)\n  * Verifiably cannot be minted arbitrarily\n  * No recursive fuse derivatives\n* Add FEI up to $2.5m FEI in any verified Fuse pool but NOT unverified pools without a snapshot vote (DAOs behind unverified pools can petition on forum)\n* Increase FEI in a pool by enough to move below target utilization if:\n  * above target (the “kink” in the interest rate model, usually 80%) for more than 90% of 1 rolling week\n  * whitelisted by DAO for increases (only FeiRari to start)\n* Decrease FEI in a pool to up to 50% of the current liquidity if:\n  * below 20% utilization for more than 90% of 1 rolling week\n\nThe points regarding Increasing/Decreasing FEI in pools also relate to non Fuse markets such as Aave, CREAM, Kashi.\n\n## Voting Rules\nThis is a binding vote which authorized OA to act according to the above charter. OA actions are still subject to timelock and veto. Quorum is 10m TRIBE. The vote follows single-choice style with the following options:\n\n* Yes, expand OA Fuse charter\n* No, do nothing\n\nIf Yes wins, OA will be able to begin enacting the policies listed following the Summary and Proposal sections.\n",

      "title": "FIP-36 LaaS in partnership with Ondo Light Framework",
      "content": "\n- [Forum Thread](https://tribe.fei.money/t/fei-protocol-and-ondo-finance-to-provide-liquidity-as-a-service-laas/3559/14)\n\n**Summary**\n\nLaunch a Liquidity-as-a-Service in partnership with Ondo Finance.\n\nCurrent liquidity mining schedules are not sustainable. Projects and investors alike are becoming increasingly aware of the harm liquidity mining does to the long-term growth of a project, and are looking for solutions. Fei Protocol is in a unique position to solve this problem, while simultaneously expanding its reach and providing additional value to current Fei ecosystem participants.\n\n**Motivation + Context**\n\nLaaS proposes to use Ondo’s unique liquidity vaults for this offering. These vaults are structured financial products that allow different parties to take on different risks when they contribute liquidity to a common AMM pair.\n\nCommunity approved projects can deposit their project token into an Ondo liquidity vault with a flexible duration, and Fei Protocol will match their deposit with an equivalent amount of FEI. The tokens are deployed as liquidity onto DEXs, such as Uniswap or SushiSwap.\n\nThis arrangement provides immediate liquidity, and essentially doubles the liquidity (for example: 5M supplied by ABC DAO + 5M FEI). Double the liquidity creates a healthier market with less slippage for users interested in buying the token. For the pilot group, the duration will be 6 months, done in 6 vaults, each of 35d duration, each opening one month apart. So there’s some overlap in liquidity at all times, and it is never remove it completely, effectively resetting every month. After the subscription window, the Ondo vault returns all remaining FEI to Fei Protocol at the end of each term, plus a small fixed fee, and returns all remaining project tokens back to the project. If there is a subsequent term, the adjusted positions are placed in the new vaults. The project keeps trading fees and assumes any impermanent loss. LaaS can be a source of revenue for DAOs, rather than a sunk cost. Even with negative price action, LaaS can still cost less than traditional liquidity mining incentives. This worksheet models scenarios to determine the sensitivity based on various assumptions and market conditions.\n\n**TRIBE Incentives**\n\nTo attract a stellar launch group, this proposal proposes to add TRIBE incentives for the first three months of the subscription period at 10AP per 1M in liquidity provided by the partnering protocol. This will strengthen the relationships with other projects and support our mission to support DAOs, as they will also generate a position in TRIBE.\n\n**Framework**\n\nSimilar to [FIP-13a Framework for FEI lending deployments](https://tribe.fei.money/t/fip-13-a-framework-for-fei-lending-deployments/3405)\n\n* High Maturity (>1bn FDV, token live > 1yr) - Up to 25m - e.g., Aave, Compound, Sushi \n* Medium Maturity (> 250m FDV, token live > 1 month) - Up to 10m - e.g., Rari Capital, FutureSwap \n* Low Maturity (FDV > 50m) - Up to 5m - e.g, PoolTogether, Notional \n\nThis framework is a bit subjective, but it will provide guardrails that allow LaaS to develop and iterate faster. .\n\nIf approved by the community, future deployments can be made based on this framework without explicitly snapshotting each integration. \n\nA follow-up proposal will follow a more detailed framework as soon as we have more data points at our disposal to tighten the offering. \n\n*Proposed Changes*\n\n- Provide up 50M FEI for LaaS \n- Add TRIBE incentives at 10AP per 1m in liquidity provided\n\n**Voting Rules**\nVoting will last 2 days and have a quorum of 10M TRIBE.\n\nPlease remember that snapshot votes can be changed, but not withdrawn until the end of the voting period.\n\n**The two options for voting:**\n- Approve the LaaS Framework\n- Don’t approve the LaaS Framework\n\n",

This can be structured as follows:\n\nThe Fei DAO to make 6M TRIBE available to the Tokemak reactor reserve by proceeding with a DAO-to-DAO trade for equivalent value in TOKE.\n\nAfter receiving TOKE, this will be staked single-sided to earn additional TOKE.\n\nThis part of the proposal can be completed by Optimistic Approval through the timelock.\n\nIn the meantime, 10k ETH will also be staked single-sided to earn additional TOKE, this ETH will come from Aave and Compound.\n\nA future proposal can determine whether to LP with the TOKE for a higher APR, and whether to supply additional TRIBE for liquidity.\n\n## Voting Rules\nThis is a non-binding, single-choice signaling vote. Quorum is 10M TRIBE. \n\nThe options are:\n* Yes, seed TRIBE and ETH\n* No, do nothing\n\nIf yes wins, the ETH segment of proposal will be submitted on-chain with a provision to send OA Timelock 6M TRIBE to complete the swap.",

      "content": "## Summary\nBegin the Fei v2 rollout with TRIBE buybacks as a percentage of protocol equity, either 5%, 10%, 15%, or 20% APR. All bought back TRIBE will initially be sent back to DAO treasury.\n\nForum discussion: https://tribe.fei.money/t/fip-37-fei-v2-tribe-buybacks/3571 \n\n## Design\nBuybacks use Balancer v2 LBPs to efficiently and continuously auction newly minted FEI for TRIBE.\n\nFei v2 has a contract called the PCVEquityMinter which mints FEI proportionally to the protocol equity and a given duration. For example an APR of 10%, frequency of every 1 month and equity of $120m would do $1m FEI of buybacks per month.\n\nAt the end of the month, the previous FEI->TRIBE auction will close and a new one will kick off.\n\nThe proposed initial parameter is 1 week frequency for buybacks with an initial trial week of 100k FEI.\n\nThe APR would be voted on by TRIBE holders, and be either 5%, 10%, 15%, or 20%. This number will be *revisited in 6 months* via snapshot.\n\nAt a current protocol equity of over $700m, this would amount to $35m, $70m, $105m, and $140m worth of buybacks in the first year, respectively.\n\nThe tradeoff of a larger buyback means less protocol equity to absorb market volatility (and prevent backstop). However, larger buybacks also increase the effective APR of liquidity mining and protocol treasury size.\nNote that buybacks will initially go exclusively back to the treasury for initial rollout, but as more v2 features roll out portions can be burned, added to tribalChief rewards, or sent elsewhere.\n\n## Voting Rules\nThis is a non-binding, approval style signalling vote. It will last from 1pm PT Oct 24 to 1pm PT Oct 26. The options are:\n* 20% APR\n* 15% APR\n* 10% APR\n* 5% APR\n* No buybacks\n\nQuorum is 10M TRIBE. The most approved option will be submitted to the DAO. \n",

      "content": "Forum Discussion: https://tribe.fei.money/t/fip-33-swap-between-balancer-dao-and-fei-dao/\n\n# Summary\nOTC deal where FEI DAO exchange FEI and TRIBE in equal proportion for 200,000 BAL (~US$ 4,400,000) form Balancer DAO.\n\n# Motivation\nBalancer will play a key role in Fei v2 1. In the new version, PCV will be managed using a Balancer v2 Investment Pool. This has the potential to add PCV (almost $1B) to the Balancer platform.\n\nAs Fei v2 brings significant TVL to Balancer, it would be beneficial for both communities to strengthen the partnership through a Treasury swap.\n\nDAO to DAO partnerships are moats, durable competitive advantages. DeFi composability works better when communities work together. Balancer is a highly respected and innovative project, the perfect fit for Fei Protocol, the main liquidity source for DeFi.\n\nAt the same time we diversify PCV by holding BAL, TRIBE will be into the hands of a long-term ecosystem partner.\n\nMoreover, as our core operations will be in Balancer platform, it is important to have some voice in the governance discussion there.\n\n# Specification\nFei DAO will deploy an appropriate version of the Badger DAO OTC Contract as the one used in the Index OTC purchase 1.\n\n200,000 BAL from the Ecosystem Fund would be exchanged for the equivalent USD value of TRIBE and FEI in equal proportions from Fei DAO Treasury, using the 20 day smooth moving average price at the time that voting ends. Price feed will be BAL/USDT (Binance) and TRIBE/FEI (Uni-V2) FEI/ETH (Uni-V2).\n\nFei DAO will deposit BAL into BAL/WETH 80/20 paired with ETH from the PCV and commits to holding for the long run. The Fei DAO will also be eligible to earn BAL rewards (currently at 22% APR) , which will be further held by Fei and possibly reinvested in the 80/20 BAL/WETH pool. Balancer DAO will be eligible to earn TRIBE rewards by participating in Fei’s incentivized staking programs (Uni v2, Rari, Curve, etc.).\n\nIn the context of the long-term partnership, both DAOs will hold the exchanged governance tokens for at least one year.\n\nAccording to the discussions, this is just the first step and in 3 months, we will submit another proposal to swap more tokens.\n\n# Voting Rules\n\nThis is a non-binding, single-choice vote  lasting 48 hours with the following options. \n\n- Execute the Swap\n- Do Not Execute the Swap\n\nThe quorum is 10M TRIBE.

      "content": "## Summary:\nUpgrade DAO to OZ Governor, remove voting delay, extend voting period to 13000 blocks (~48h)\n\n## Motivation:\nFei is currently using the GovernorAlpha as our DAO contract (developed by Compound). Compound has since migrated to the GovernorBravo which allows for specifying a voting-reason when voting, and adjusting parameters such as quorum and proposal threshold.\n\nOpenZeppelin developed a modular governance library that is compatible with the GovernorBravo interface known as the “OZ Governor”. This is the current state-of-the-art, and will likely receive future upgrades by the OZ team. We should upgrade our code to this to prevent incompatibility issues such as the recent Tally UI bug.\n\nAs part of the upgrade, we should also remove the voting delay and extend the voting period. Delays are generally useful for giving TRIBE holders time to migrate and delegate before the “snapshot block” that determines voting weight. However, in practice most DAOs do not employ a voting delay so voting can start immediately after a proposal is submitted.\n\nTo compensate for the removal of the voting delay, we should expand the voting period to 48h to maintain a 72h DAO cycle.\n\n## Proposal:\nUpgrade DAO to OZ Governor found here: https://github.com/fei-protocol/fei-protocol-core/pull/187\nReduce voting delay from 3333 blocks to 1 block\nIncrease voting period from 10000 blocks to 13000\n\n## Voting Rules:\nThis is a non-binding, single-choice vote. The quorum is 10M TRIBE. The two options are:\n- yes, upgrade to OZ governor\n- no, do nothing\n\nIf yes wins, the OZ governor upgrade will be submitted for DAO vote on-chain.",

Thanks to the new incentivized aFEI pool, FEI is a candidate for a new PoolTogether pool.\n\nTo kick off the pool, TRIBE can add rewards to incentivize depositors. The proposal is to add ~$100k TRIBE split over 10 weeks. This TRIBE would be added on top of the *prize* as opposed to being distributed as a normal APR. This tends to reduce the “farm and dump” behavior and instead incentivize unique depositors to come join for a chance to win a TRIBE prize.\n\nThe PoolTogether community has already signaled support to this proposal and even will consider adding POOL rewards after the initial bootstrapping.\n\n# Voting Rules\nThis is a binding, single-choice vote to authorize Optimistic Approval to direct TRIBE towards PoolTogether. The two options are:\n1. Yes, incentivize PoolTogether\n2. No, do nothing\n\nIf the proposal passes, the Optimistic Approval team will add a new TRIBE reward stream to the PoolTogether reward contract that can add TRIBE to the prize. The exact amount of allocation points will be determined based on ~$100k TRIBE value at time of queueing, and will be adjusted as the AP changes in TribalChief during the 10 week window.\n",

This will represent a substantial amount of rewards, and likely drive over 50m TVL to the FeiRari pool.\n\nThis change will lead to some interesting behavior, such as making TRIBE cheap to borrow while subsidizing lending. This could lead to dangerous recursive leverage which reduces rewards for average users.\n\n## Proposal:\n- Make TRIBE unborrowable on FeiRari\n- Allow fTRIBE (FeiRari TRIBE) to vote on snapshot\n\nThese two changes will mitigate any risky behavior brought about by these new incentives, and simultaneously increase governance participation through snapshot.\n\n## Voting rules:\nThis is a non-binding single choice vote lasting 48 hours with the following options:\n- Yes, disable TRIBE borrowing and enable voting\n- No, do nothing\n\nQuorum is 10M TRIBE. If the vote passes, fTRIBE snapshot voting will be enabled immediately, and disabling TRIBE will be sent to the DAO.\n",

They are also one of the main ways that the Fei PCV increases in size (the others being asset appreciation and yield farming). Bonding curves are a foundational mechanism that allow the protocol to grow.\n\nThe way that Fei bonding curves work is that each bonding curve uses a specific asset (e.g. ETH, DAI, or RAI). Users can acquire FEI off of a bonding curve using that asset. Bonding curves sell FEI at either a discount or a premium depending on whether the amount of FEI issued by that bonding curve is below or above a **scale** parameter. Each bonding curve has its own **scale**, **discount**, and **premium** parameters. Each bonding curve also has a **cap** parameter on the total amount of FEI it can issue.\n\nSee forum thread for an overview of current values of bonding curve parameters\n\n# Proposed Changes\n\nWe propose a series of changes to the bonding curves to help increase the amount of circulating FEI and grow the PCV:\n\n- Modify ETH bonding curve: premium 0.\n- Modify DAI bonding curve: scale 100M, cap 150M, discount 0.\n- Modify DPI bonding curve: cap to 50M, discount 0.\n- Modify RAI bonding curve: cap to 20M\n\n# Voting Rules\n\nVoting will last 2 days and will have a quorum of 10M TRIBE.\n\nThis is a non-binding signal vote.

      "content": "# Forum Thread\n\nhttps://tribe.fei.money/t/fip-26-raise-reserve-stabilizer-backstop-to-0-995/3508\n\n# Executive Summary\n\nRaise the reserve stabilizer redemption floor from $0.99 to $0.995.\n\n# Motivation + Context\n\nDirect redemption is the simplest and most desirable guarantee for a stablecoin. Holders want to know that at any point in time, a stablecoin can be exchanged for its face value. A direct redemption mechanism is the simplest way to make this happen.\n\nMany stablecoins such as FEI, FRAX, and LUSD use a redemption system as part of peg maintenance. FEI’s other peg maintenance mechanism, reweights, suffers from a number of drawbacks such as high implementation complexity, delayed response times to price shocks, and allowing some MEV through sandwiching. As such, Fei V2 will remove reweights in favor of direct redemptions.\n\nRedemption will thus take on the full burden of peg maintenance. The primary way that redemptions are currently used is in risk-free atomic arbitrage. When FEI is trading below $0.99, arbitrageurs can buy FEI and redeem it for $0.99. However, standard DEX fees of 0.3% make this trade less efficient, and only risk-free when FEI is $0.987 or below. As such, keeping FEI above $0.99 requires raising the redemption value to at least $0.993.\n\nBeyond peg maintenance, there are also utility and narrative benefits to raising the redemption floor. A stablecoin is more useful if it can be redeemed more closely to its face value. Raising this backstop would make FEI more competitive with other stablecoins that have similar redemption mechanisms.\n\n# Proposed Changes\n\nRaise the reserve stabilizer redemption floor from $0.99 to $0.995.\n\n# Voting Rules\nVoting will last 2 days and will have a quorum of 10M TRIBE.\n\nThis is a non-binding signal vote.

Fees earned by the position are automatically reinvested into the position by Gelato automation for compounding effects. Liquidity is added into the G-UNI Pooled Position and G-UNI tokens are minted. These G-UNI tokens have the ability to be staked into liquidity mining program such as FEI's TribalChief rewards to earn TRIBE. Specifically, we are proposing that 100 AP rewards be directed to G-UNI FEI-DAI.\n\nTechnical Details:\nThe G-UNI FEI-DAI pool will be a fixed range position that does not change. At first, the pool will be managed by the Gelato multisig but will be handed off to FEI’s optimistic approval multisig shortly after.\n\nFEI/DAI specs:\nFee Tier: 0.05% (see pool here 1)\nPosition Lower Bound: 1 FEI = 0.9901 DAI (tick = -100)\nPosition Upper Bound: 1 FEI = 1.0101 DAI (tick = 100)\nAP Rewards: 100\n\nVoting Rules:\nVoting will last 2 days.

      "content": "Status: Proposed\n\nAuthors: Joey Santoro (Fei Protocol Founder), Brianna Montgomery (Fei Labs Team), Matthew Graham (@Matthew_Graham) and David (@oneski22)\nDiscussion to: https://gov.indexcoop.com/t/iip-82-use-indexcoops-aave-holdings-to-list-fei-on-aave-v2/2573\nCreated: 5th September 2021\nQuorum: 104,196 INDEX [2,083,937*0.05]\n\nSimple Summary / Abstract\n\nThis IIP requests the IndexCoop’s Aave voting rights to be used for the sole purpose of submitting an AIP and then separately for voting FOR listing FEI as a collateral asset on Aave V2.\n\nAbout the Requestor\n\nFEI is one of the few truly decentralized stablecoins and is mostly backed by ETH. Fei Protocol’s PCV holds ~$970M, providing a 459% collateralization ratio for all circulating FEI. FEI’s total supply stands at $416M with $206M FEI controlled by the protocol and $210M FEI in circulation. FEI is within the top 10 largest stablecoins by total supply.\n\nWhile relatively new, the FEI protocol and community have made significant progress on peg stabilization mechanisms. FEI remains one of the most liquid stablecoins, with more than $300M in liquidity available on Uniswap v2. Current liquidity dynamics enable $1MM trades with <0.95bps slippage from the Uniswap V2 pool.\n\nFei introduces a community-governed reserve-backed stablecoin that aims to achieve digitally-driven, governance-minimized central banking. Fei has created a new stablecoin that seeks to stabilize itself, not via IOU-based debt commitments, rather through a monetary peg-based policy on the basis of protocol-controlled reserves, currently valued at $970 million.\n\nAt the time of posting, the 7- day FEI volume on Uniswap V3 is $163M and $292M on Uniswap V2. In addition to the new volume and TVL that FEI would bring to the Aave ecosystem, FEI would provide Aave with diversification benefits, including another decentralized stablecoin.\n\nProposal Details\n\nThe proposal calls for the addition of FEI to the Aave V2 market for supply and borrow only. That means there will be a 0% Loan to Value, 20% Reserve Factor, and the same slope curve as sUSD with Slope 1 of 4% and Slope 2 of 100%. The full details can be found on the Aave forums here.\n\nFei Protocol has advanced FEI by:\n\nSubmitting an ARC on the governance forum,\nCompleted a risk assessment\nSubmitted a PR\nCompleted a sentiment check via snapshot\nIncorporated feedback from the Aave community\nMotivation\nBenefits for Aave and the DeFi Ecosystem\n\nIf listed, FEI would be one of the most decentralized stablecoins on Aave. The Fei DAO can support FEI markets on Aave by providing FEI liquidity. Traders will have the ability to tap into the large FEI-ETH liquidity on Uni V2 ($310M) as well as any future protocol owned or incentivized liquidity pools.\n\nEnabling FEI for lending on Aave would allow the $426M circulating FEI supply to be deposited into Aave, and would also allow Fei Protocol to use the protocol-controlled value (PCV) ($756M) to create highly liquid lending markets.\n\nBenefits for Index Coop\n\nFei Protocol provides approximately $18M DPI-FEI on-chain liquidity via Sushiswap after purchasing $10.1M of DPI on the 10th August 2021. The remaining $1M DPI, along with $1M FEI was deposited into the Index Coop Rari Fuse pool.\n\nOnce listing FEI on Aave V2, Fei Protocol would like nothing more than to provide the liquidity for the next round of leverage products. Fei Protocol can ensure there is sufficient liquidity for future leverage products. There is over $300M of TVL in the FEI-ETH pool on Uniswap V2 which is ideal for the iETH-FLI product.\n\nSpecification\n\nDPI multi-sig wallet delegates the Aave voting power to an EOA controlled by IndexCoop’s Dev Team which then can be used for submitting the FEI proposal and moving FEI forward to a vote!\n\nVote\n\nFOR\nDelegate IndexCoop’s Aave voting power to 0x7f4C5938AF9731e9feadc09C3FA782508198532E for listing FEI on Aave V2\n\nAGAINST\nDo not delegate IndexCoop’s Aave voting power to 0x7f4C5938AF9731e9feadc09C3FA782508198532E for listing FEI on Aave V2\n\nNOTE: There will NOT be separate snapshot vote, to decide how INDEX's AAVE holdings will vote on the AIP should this IIP pass.\n\nCopyright\nCopyright and related rights waived via CC0.\n",

      "title": "FIP-24 Gas Refund For TribalChief Transition",
      "content": "## Forum Thread:\nhttps://tribe.fei.money/t/fip-24-gas-refund-for-tribal-chief-transition/3493\n\n## Executive Summary:\n\nGive a 400 FEI gas refund to users that transition their FEI-TRIBE LP tokens from the Fei’s old staking system to the new TribalChief staking system.\n\n## Motivation:\n\nTransitioning to the new TribalChief staking system brings many possibilities. But one major annoyance is the gas fees required to transfer funds from the old staking system into the new one. Giving a gas refund to users that transition to the new system would help ease this burden.\n\n## Specification:\n\nThe protocol implementation steps:\n1. After the cutoff date (September 30, 11:59PM PST), a list of eligible gas refund recipients will be compiled (see below).\n2. A total of (# of eligible users) * 400 FEI will be minted and sent to the Optimistic Approval (OA) multisig, along with 50 ETH for operational costs. Leftover ETH can be used to fund future multisig action gas costs.\n3. The OA multisig will then initiate batches of multisend calls to distribute 400 FEI to each eligible gas refund recipient.\n\nTo become eligible for the refund:\n- A user must have >$1 worth of FEI-TRIBE LP tokens staked between August 1, 2021 and September 3, 2021.\n- A user must have at least the same amount of FEI-TRIBE LP tokens staked in TribalChief on September 30 at 11:59PM PST. To account for dust and other inefficiencies, users will still be eligible if they have at least 98% of the same number of FEI-TRIBE LP tokens staked.\n\nSome implementation details:\n- There are slightly more than 2,000 addresses that can become eligible for the refund.\n- The refunds will be submitted in batches because Ethereum blocks are limited in size and 2,000 addresses is a lot of memory.\n- The advantage of refunding in FEI vs TRIBE is that price is more stable, so the refund better reflects the underlying gas costs. FEI transfers are also slightly more gas efficient.\n\n## Voting Rules\nVoting will last 2 days and will have a quorum of 10M TRIBE.\n\nThis is a non-binding signal vote. Please keep in mind that snapshot votes can be changed but not withdrawn until the end of the voting period.\n\nThe two options for voting:\n1. Yes give gas refund\n2. No, do not give gas refund\n",

      "content": "# Summary\n\nRaise reserve stabilizer backstop from $0.95 to $0.99\n\n# Motivation\n\nFEI is a stablecoin. Two of the most important features of a stablecoin are 1) stability to its peg 2) user trust that this peg will always be maintained.\n\nThe primary mechanism that FEI uses to maintain its $1.00 peg are reweights. When FEI is trading at less than $0.995 on the FEI-ETH pair on Uniswap V2, the protocol will “reweight” the price by buying enough FEI to bring the price up to $1.00. This process currently occurs as often as every 4 hours.\n\nFei has an additional peg maintenance mechanism that is much less frequently used, the reserve stabilizer backstop. This mechanism allows each unit of FEI to be redeemed for $0.95 of ETH. This mechanism was implemented in FIP-2.\n\nSince the protocol is continually growing stronger, it is time to consider raising this backstop from $0.95 to $0.99, much closer to the peg value of $1.00. This would give a strong signal to potential users that the protocol is able to maintain its peg.\n\n## Advantages:\n- Increased confidence in FEI by current FEI users, prospective FEI users, and users of integrating protocols\n- Every FEI redeemed through the reserve stabilizer still earns the protocol a fee, because the redemption value is lower than the face value of $1.00\n\n## Disadvantages:\n- Could leave FEI more sensitive to stale oracle attacks\n\n# Voting Rules\nVoting will last 2 days. This is a non-binding signal vote. Please keep in mind that snapshot votes can be changed but not withdrawn until the end of the voting period.\n\nThe two options to vote on are:\n1. Yes, raise reserve stabilizer backstop to $0.99\n2. No, leave reserve stabilizer backstop at $0.95\n\nThis is a single choice vote, if Yes wins with greater than 50% approval and 10M TRIBE quorum, the proposal will be submitted to the DAO ",

This approach would mean Aave cannot be a part of the TribalChief incentives program as those rewards change as new programs are added and are calculated per block.\n\nAdditionally, we should only incentivize borrowing so that we avoid farming our own TRIBE rewards as a DAO. The benefits of incentivizing borrowing are that it stimulates the demand side for FEI on one of the largest lending platforms. It helps subsidize using FEI for leverage to compete with DAI, USDC, and USDT.\n\n## Specification\n1. Withdraw 4 million TRIBE from the FeiRewardsDistributor and send to the AaveIncentivesController for TRIBE.\n2. Update the AaveIncentivesController to have an end date of March 1, 2022 and an emissions/s rate of 4m TRIBE/total seconds (updated at proposal time) exclusively for FEI variable rate borrowing.\n\nDevelopment will be carried out by @joey and code review by the Aave core team.\n\n## Voting Rules\nVoting will last 2 days.

      "title": "FIP-20 Lido Staked ETH (Part 2) & PCV Dripper Re-allocation",
      "content": "Discussion\n\nhttps://tribe.fei.money/t/fip-20-lido-staked-eth-steth-part-2/3454\n\n\nBasic Summary\n\nThis proposal will fully deploy the ETH in the Dripper:\n\n1. Invest 14,611 ETH (approximately 6% of PCV) from PCV into Lido stETH;\n2. Allocate 75,000 ETH to the Compound Finance Supply Market;\n3. Allocate 75,000 ETH to the Aave V2 Supply Market.\n\n\nMotivation\n\nThis proposal is modeled after FIP-9 (https://tribe.fei.money/t/fip-9-staking-eth/3331) and intends to build upon it, based on the success of its execution.\n\nAn additional investment into stETH will allow the PCV to grow in value and to assist to protect FEI’s peg and to lay the groundwork to drive utility and adoption. Per the PCV Investment Guidelines, the total proportion of the PCV in stETH will be at about 10% of PCV, within the parameters described therein. Fei Protocol’s vision remains the same - to strengthen our positioning in the stablecoin sector and to remain optimistic in the long term value of ETH.\n\nLido allows users to stake ETH on the Ethereum beacon chain to earn daily rewards. The stETH is a token that represents staked ether using Lido and is pegged 1:1 to the ETH. Its value is the result of initial deposit plus staking rewards less penalties. The daily staking rewards are paid in stETH and will accrue in the PCV.\n\nThe second purpose of this proposal is to more effectively activate capital that is currency underutilized in the PCV Dripper. Fei has been successful in maintaining its peg through reweights, and therefore it will be more productive to deploy this ETH into highly liquid lending markets. As of this writing, after the 14,611 ETH for stETH there is approximately 150,000 ETH remaining in the PCV Dripper. This proposal will remove 150,000 ETH from the Dripper and allocate them 50/50 into both Compound and Aave to be available to be borrowed. This trade also has the benefit of also accruing COMP and stkAAVE tokens, which will be currently stored in the PCV.\n\nThe proposal includes new code for a PCV Drip Controller that can drip straight from a PCV deposit like Compound or Aave to be more capital efficient. For this reason we can completely empty the existing dripper. For compatibility reasons we will need to deploy a new reserve stabilizer contract, but it can use the same parameterization unless another vote changes that.\n\nAn adjustment to the Redemption policy and its backstop level will be proposed separately. \nAny redeployment of the accrued COMP and stkAAVE tokens will be proposed separately.\n\n\nSpecification\n\nThis proposal will:\n\n- Re-utilize the EthLidoPCVDeposit (https://etherscan.io/address/0xAc38Ee05C0204A1E119C625d0a560D6731478880) and hold a further 14,611 ETH as stETH. For how this contract works, refer to the FIP-9 specification (https://snapshot.org/#/fei.eth/proposal/QmWraPkBtnNVB5jsGKweUivxA7TwfJw9KuJ5XWvG2PibcM).\n- Create a new ERC20CompoundPCVDeposit contract for depositing ETH in Compound, along with an associated PCVDripController\n- Create a new AavePCVDeposit contract for depositing ETH in Aave, along with an associated PCVDripController\n\nAccess control changes:\n- Grant Burner to new EthReserveStabilizer and revoke from old stabilizer\n- Grant PCVController to two new PCVDripController contracts\n\n\nVoting Rules\n\nVoting will last 2 days.\nThis is a non-binding signal vote. Please keep in mind that snapshot votes can be changed but not withdrawn until the end of the voting period.\n\nThe two options to vote on are:\n\n1. 14,611 ETH to Lido stETH and Redeployment of PCVDripper ETH to Compound (75,000 ETH) and Aave (75,000 ETH)\n\n2. No further deployment on LIDO stETH, no redeployment of PCVDripper ETH to Compound and Aave\n\nThis is a single choice vote, if option 1 wins the majority, we will submit a DAO proposal 24h after the end of the snapshot vote.\n",

      "title": "FIP-21: Optimistic Approval",
      "content": "This proposal introduces a mechanism called Optimistic Approval (OA) to the Fei ecosystem. Under OA, a multisig is created that is able to modify a narrowly defined set of protocol parameters. **The sole mandate of the OA multisig is to enact the results of snapshot votes. Any actions carried out by the OA multisig are timelocked and can be veto’d by either the DAO or by a Guardian. Proposals will still be required to be posted in the Forum and be discussed before being posted in Snapshot.** Social consensus will enforce these rules.\n\nThe main benefit of OA is significantly increasing voting participation by eliminating gas fees and allowing staked TRIBE to vote. It will also allow for more efficient iterations on specific protocol parameters, especially those related to integrations such as Rari and TribalChief staking.\n\nEach OA multisig can have a specific limited set of protocol parameters that it is able to modify. For the foreseeable future, multisigs will not have the ability to mint/burn FEI, to modify contracts, or to modify core protocol parameters. **To maximize security and impose checks and balances, any actions carried out by the OA multisig are timelocked and can be veto’d by either the DAO or by a Guardian.**\n\nSnapshots must satisfy the following conditions to fall under the scope of OA:\n- Must reach 10 million vote quorum in favor of proposal\n- Must be live for >= 2 days\n\nOA multi-sig holders must abide by the following policies:\n- __*Vote in line with snapshots*__: All multisig votes should be supported by the results of snapshot votes. Failure to do so will result in removal from the multisig.\n- __*Use it or lose it*__: Holders that are inactive over a long period of time will be removed from the multisig\n\nFor the first iteration of OA, we propose creating a multisig that is able to call any functions on the TribalChief contract except increasing emissions or withdrawing TRIBE. This functionality includes 1) creating new pools, 2) changing pool reward weights, 3) changing the block reward rate.\n\nHolders of the multisig must be trusted members of the community that are highly engaged and highly knowledgeable about Fei. For the first iteration of OA, the following 7 community members are both qualified and have self-signalled interest to participate in the multisig:\n1. Bruno\n2. CountVidal\n3. cozeno\n4. DioDionysos\n5. fei.saver\n6. Meertitan\n7. pavel\n\nEach multisig holder will be expected to be generally available to vote when need be. Each holder will be paid 1000 TRIBE at the end of the one month trial for their efforts.\n\nThis will be a 1 month trial period. This policy should be considered an experiment and expected to change in future iterations. Future iterations of optimistic approval might vary in 1) the scope of protocol parameters they are allowed to control, 2) the timescale on which they will be able to modify protocol parameters, 3) the holders of the multisig and the total number of holders, 4) the amount paid to holders of the multisig.\n\n**It is important to reiterate that OA is NOT a conventional multisig. Its powers are narrowly defined, its mandate is merely to enact snapshot votes on-chain, and all of its actions are gated by a timelock and can be veto’d by the DAO or Guardian before they take effect on-chain.**",

      "content": "Forum thread: https://tribe.fei.money/t/fip-19-subsidized-rai-bonding-curve/3442\n\n## Summary\nOpen a RAI bonding curve with 6 million FEI subsidized. This would mean the PCV acquiring about 2 million RAI (0.8% of the PCV). The RAI would be allocated to the Rari Capital Fuse pool 9 and/or Aave. \n\n## Background on RAI\nRAI is a decentralized and governance minimized stablecoin. It launched in February 2021, the current market cap is $50m and the TVL is $160m. RAI has managed to stabilize using its on-chain PID controller and is now undergoing a governance minimization process with the intention to harden the protocol. RAI follows the same overcollateralization model of MakerDAO’s DAI but is exclusively backed by Ether. While not being strictly pegged to 1 dollar, RAI is stable showing a daily volatility well under 1% on most days.\n\n## Specification\n### Bonding curve\nUse the ERC20 bonding curve with 6m FEI scale, 10m FEI mint cap, a pre-scale discount of 0.3% and premium post-scale of 2%. \n### Allocation\nFor the allocation there are 3 possibilities: \n- 50% Aave + 50% Fuse\n- 75% Aave + 25% Fuse\n- 100% Aave\n## Voting rules\nThis is an approval style vote, meaning multiple options can be selected. Whichever option of the group receives highest approval will be submitted to the DAO, this is a non-binding signal vote. ",

      "title": "FIP 10.1 DAI Bonding Curve",
      "content": "**Basic Summary**\nThe following is a proposal to open a bonding curve for DAI, with a target scale and cap of 50M FEI, at a discount of 0.3%.\n\nThis would add ~49.85M DAI to the PCV, and release up to 50M FEI into circulation.\n\n**Motivation**\nThis proposal fits in a larger plan to interface with the Curve protocol, and improve the liquidity of FEI against other stablecoins.\n\nPossible intended future deployment (pending current & future code development and a vote) for this DAI are :\n- **Providing liquidity in the Curve FEI metapool**\n- Providing liquidity on Uniswap v3 against DAI\n- Deploying DAI to Aave, the FeiRari, or leaving it in Compound\n\nThese deployments will have to be approved in a separate proposal, once we have acquired DAI in the PCV. This proposal is a prerequisite to any PCV action involving DAI.\n\nWaiting for the next vote(s), the DAI acquired will be temporarily deposited on Compound, yielding around ~3k DAI per day, plus ~1.5k$ of COMP per day at current rates.\n\n**Specification**\nA DAI bonding curve will be created with a 50M FEI fundraising target. DAI holders are able to deposit DAI tokens into a contract and receive a 0.3% discount to the Chainlink oracle feed paid in FEI. All the transaction costs are borne by DAI depositors. Depositors are expected to arbitrage the bonding curve discount to get more FEI than DAI deposited.\nThe DAO proposals steps will be :\nGrant Minter role to the new DAI bonding curve\n \n**Voting Rules**\nVoting will last 2 days.\nThis is a non-binding signal vote. Please keep in mind that snapshot votes can be changed but not withdrawn until the end of the voting period.\nThe two options to vote on are:\n- Open DAI bonding curve as proposed\n- More discussions needed\n\nThis is a binary vote. If option 1 wins, a DAO vote will be submitted next week.",

It can also allow users to lock up their tokens for fixed time periods to earn boosted rewards, if this is a feature that is desired in the future.\n\nThe initial proposed allocation is ⅓ FEI-TRIBE Uniswap LP, ⅓ FeiRari TRIBE, and ⅓ Curve FEI-3Crv LP with the same emission schedule currently used.\n\nProposal\n\nTransition our current staking rewards from FEI-TRIBE LP to the “TribalChief”, the Tribe’s version of the SushiSwap MasterChef.\n\nThe TribalChief distributes a constant amount of TRIBE rewards per block. The initial TRIBE per block will be 75. Every month the Tribe will update the rewards distribution such that the linearly decreasing schedule is maintained. \n\nThe distribution of rewards can be adjusted to the highest leverage FEI and TRIBE deployments for the protocol as needed.\n\nThis proposal includes a vote on determining how to allocate the initial rewards distribution. Each pool would earn their proportional amount of the TRIBE emissions relative to the total.\n\n1000 AP each:\n- FeiRari Fuse Pool TRIBE\n- Existing FEI-TRIBE LP rewards\n- Curve liquidity incentives\n\nVoting Rules\n\nThis will be a binary, non-binding signal vote.\n\nNote that the TribalChief reward allocations can be subject to change after the initial rollout if it passes, this proposal informs the initial allocation.",

If the mixed option wins, we will use 3 separate contracts.\n\nNote: DeFi Pulse will consider snapshot approval of this proposal (and execution of OTC contracts) as finalization of both parties intent to trade.\n\n## Appendix:\n\nJoey and I grabbed these rates during a video call immediately before submission\n\nGoogle Sheet with screenshots and calculations is here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1eu0hnqxyWPfX1kfyCYM9dv6ExSOIk0x7_d-f4n7xOmk/edit?usp=sharing\n\n## Forum discussion \nhttps://tribe.fei.money/t/proposal-buying-defi-pulse-index-dpi/3348\n\n## Voting Rules:\nThis is an approval style vote, meaning multiple options can be selected.

They can even allow users to lock up their tokens for fixed time periods to earn boosted rewards.\n\n## Proposal\nTransition our current staking rewards from FEI-TRIBE LP to the “TribalChief”, the Tribe’s version of the SushiSwap MasterChef.\nThe TribalChief distributes a constant amount of TRIBE rewards per block. The initial TRIBE per block will be 50. This would be a 33% decrease from the current reward distribution frequency ~75/block. Every quarter the Tribe will update the rewards distribution by subtracting 5 from the TRIBE per block. This would reach 0 after 2.5 years, a slight extension on the current rewards schedule.\nThe distribution of rewards can be adjusted to the highest leverage FEI and TRIBE deployments for the protocol as needed.\n\nTwo separate proposals will come later in the event this one passes:\nOptimistic Approval for supporting changes to the rewards\nLockups and conditions surrounding the lockups\n\nThis proposal includes a vote on determining how to allocate the initial rewards distribution. Each pool would earn their proportional amount of the TRIBE emissions relative to the total.\n\n### 1000 AP Tier:\nAAVE lending and borrowing (split 50/50)\nCurve liquidity incentives\n\n### 250 AP Tier:\nFeiRari Fuse Pool TRIBE\nExisting FEI-TRIBE LP rewards\n\n### 100 AP Tier:\nStakeDAO\nPoolTogether\nIdle Finance\nRuler Protocol\nGelato FEI-USDC UniV3\nBancor\n\n## Voting Rules\nThis will be an approval style vote where each of the above incentive pools will be an option and “more discussions” and “no TribalChief” options.\n\nIf “more discussions” receives more than 50% of the vote, we will continue discussions on the forum and determine an alternate proposal to bring forward. Likewise “no TribalChief” would end the discussions on the proposal if it receives more than 50% approval.\n\nEach potentially incentivized token that receives more than 50% approval will be included in the initial rollout of the TribalChief at the specified allocation points level.\n\nNote that the TribalChief rewards allocations will be subject to change after the initial rollout if it passes, these will just inform the initial allocation.",

      "content": "# Forum Discussion\n\nhttps://tribe.fei.money/t/proposal-buying-defi-pulse-index-dpi/3348\nAuthor: Bruno Rodrigues and Matthew Graham\n\n# Basic Summary\n\nUsing the $10M DPI to be acquired as detailed in FIP-14, we propose creating a $18M DPI-FEI pool on Sushiswap and depositing $1M DPI and $1M FEI in the Rari Index Coop Fuse Pool. Deploying DPI and FEI in the Rari Fuse Pool is captured by FIP-13.\n\nFei Protocol and Index Coop communities are working together to explore attaining SUSHI rewards and possibly integrating the DPI-FEI LP token into Aave and Creams lending platform. \n\n# Motivation\n\nThis proposal increases on-chain FEI liquidity and utility. The DPI-FEI pool will be the largest stable coin DPI pool trading on a decentralised exchange and the SLP token has the potential to be collateral on both CREAM and Aave’s AMM platform. \n\nProviding liquidity on Sushiswap is expected to strengthen the three way relationship between Fei Protocol, Index Coop and Sushiswap. The three communities are currently discussing the possibility of the SUSHI incentives, and with the INDEX incentives on the DPI-ETH pool coming to an end, there is the possibility that the DPI-FEI pools becomes the largest on-chain source of liquidity for DPI which is great for FEI. This liquidity helps leverage traders take advantage of the FEI borrow liquidity against DPI in both Fuse and Kashi without additional swaps through ETH.\n\nIn addition to exploring incentives on the DPI-FEI pool, we are also seeking to list the SLP token (ERC20) as collateral on lending protocols like Aave’s AMM and CREAM’s platform. Liquidity providers can then potentially earn additional rewards and use the SLP token to draw a loan. This is expected to increase the stickiness of the DPI-FEI liquidity.\n\nWe propose depositing $1M DPI and $1M FEI into the Rari Fuse Index Coop Pool  as part of FIP-13 and we are also considering depositing DPI and FEI to Kashi which will draw on DPI and FEI tokens from the Sushiswap pool. \n\n# Specification\n\n$9M of the DPI acquired via a bonding Curve detailed in FIP-14 shall be paired with $9M of minted FEI and deposited into a 50/50 DPI-FEI pool on Sushiswap, using an ERC-20 compatible UniswapPCVDeposit similar to the FEI-ETH pair. This pair will not have any reweights. The oracle price for depositing will be the Chainlink DPI-USD feed. \n\nThe DPI will be held in an ERC20CompoundPCVDeposit for the Index Coop Fuse pool.\n\nThe mechanism for seeding these pools will be a 90/10 split on all incoming bonding curve funds to the respective destinations. Future funding through the bonding curve beyond the subsidized $10m will also be split according to these ratios.\n\n# Voting Rules\n\nVoting will last 2 days.\nThis is a non-binding signal vote. Please keep in mind that snapshot votes can be changed but not withdrawn until the end of the voting period.\n\nThe two options to vote on are:\n* FOR\nProvide $18M Liquidity to DPI-FEI pair on Sushiswap\n\n* AGAINST\nDo Not Provide $18M Liquidity to DPI-FEI pair on Sushiswap\n\nThis is a single choice vote, if option 1 wins the majority, we will submit a DAO proposal 24h after the end of the snapshot vote.",

      "content": "# Forum Discussion\nhttps://tribe.fei.money/t/proposal-buying-defi-pulse-index-dpi/3348\nAuthor: Bruno Rodrigues and Matthew Graham\n\n# Basic Summary\n\nThe following is a proposal to invest 10M FEI, which represents ~2% of PCV,  into the DeFi Pulse Index (DPI).\n\nThe DPI is a capitalization-weighted index that tracks the performance of the top DeFi tokens. It is currently composed of 14 popular DeFi tokens available on Ethereum. \n\n# Motivation\n\nThe main purpose for purchasing $10M of DPI is to grow PCV through having exposure to the DeFi sector. By diversifying the PCV FEI Protocol intends to better protect the peg and help drive FEI utility and adoption.\n\nDPI is an efficient way to get exposure to the DeFi sector. The index gives exposure to all the underlying protocol tokens while only having to hold one single token. The top 7 tokens of DPI represent ~90% of the Index portfolio (Uniswap, Aave, Maker, Compound, Sushi, Yearn and Synthetix). The 95 basis point streaming fee is more capital efficient for Fei compared to replicating the product in-house and then incurring regular rebalancing costs. \n\nDPI is also listed on CREAM and soon to be listed on AAVE which has the added benefit of enabling DPI to be deployed productively.\n\nThis DPI investment does not exclude investing in other DeFi projects. Having individual positions in other DeFi protocols offers governance influence and the ability to pair the token with FEI in providing on-chain liquidity. This is viewed as a complementary approach to holding DPI.\n\nFei has been working with Index Coop which lead to FEI being included in Rari’s  Fuse pool #19. Both DAOs are looking forward to growing the relationship between the two communities. A $10M purchase of DPI would make Fei one of the larger DPI holders and will further strengthen the two communities.\n\nAfter acquiring DPI, Fei can provide liquidity for FEI-DPI pair across Fuse, CREAM, UniV2 or Sushi.\n\nConsidering the poll on PCV Guidelines, the proposed allocation for DPI would leave space for this other DeFi tokens allocation (up to the limit of 10% of PCV). \n\nOur risk analysis of DPI is available in the [forum post](https://tribe.fei.money/t/proposal-buying-defi-pulse-index-dpi/3348).\n\n# Specification\n\nA DPI bonding curve will be created with a $10M FEI fundraising target. DPI holders are able to deposit DPI tokens into a contract and receive between a 1% discount and up to a 2% premium to the Chainlink oracle feed paid in FEI. All the transaction costs are borne by DPI depositors. Depositors are expected to arbitrage the bonding curve premium leading to an increase in the supply of DPI via the exchange issuance mechanism offered by Index Coop.\n\nGiven the exchange issuance mechanism provided by Index Coop and the DPI/ETH being monitored by flashbots, DPI’s price is expected to continue tracking the Net Asset Value. The history of DPI’s price relative to NAV can be seen on the [Index Coop Dune DPI Dashboard](https://duneanalytics.com/jdcook/DPI). \n\n# Voting Rules\nVoting will last 2 days.\nThis is a non-binding signal vote. Please keep in mind that snapshot votes can be changed but not withdrawn until the end of the voting period.\n\nThe two options to vote on are:\n\n* FOR\nOpen a Bonding Curve with $10M FEI funding target \n\n* AGAINST\nDo Not open a Bonding Curve with $10M FEI funding target\n\nThis is a single choice vote, if option 1 wins the majority, we will submit a DAO proposal 24h after the end of the snapshot vote.",

      "content": "## Forum discussions: \nhttps://tribe.fei.money/t/fip-13-a-framework-for-fei-lending-deployments/3405 \n\n## Abstract\nThis proposal establishes a light framework for deploying FEI to lending integrations. It will be applied to determine which types of lending deployments can be taken straight to the DAO without a snapshot. This framework does not cover non-lending integrations or TRIBE incentives. All FEI deployed will be minted, up to 50% of the protocol equity (PCV - user circulating FEI).\n\n## Motivation\nLending FEI deployments accomplish a few key objectives:\n* Bootstrapping markets - without an original source of FEI to borrow, markets cannot have borrowers and can’t have the APY to generate yield.\n* Partnership - being able to easily bootstrap USD liquidity for leverage in a market is a strong value prop for potential partners (for example the Olympus pool party integration)\n* Visibility - by being in many markets with high liquidity, people see and use FEI in diverse places.\n* Earning yield for PCV - by earning FEI back to the protocol, we improve the collateralization and net PCV equity\n\n## Proposal\nWe should aim to deploy FEI to help bootstrap markets wherever possible, with sizing scoped to the maturity of the market.\nThis proposal includes the following framework:\n\n* High Maturity (1b+ TVL) - 25-50m - e.g. Aave, Compound\n* Medium Maturity (100m+ TVL) - 5-10m - e.g. FeiRari Fuse, CREAM\n* Low Maturity (<100m TVL) - 1-2.5m - e.g. Fuse and Kashi partnerships\n\n\nThis framework is somewhat subjective, but it will allow us to move more quickly on these integrations as we assess the market demand for FEI liquidity across various platforms and userbases. For example FeiRari received exceptionally high FEI minted due to its strategic importance to the DAO. Other risk factors such as liquidity and volatility of other assets in the pool should be considered as well.\n\nThis proposal caps the size of overall lent out FEI, to prevent a Soros attack (borrowing and shorting FEI to drain protocol reserves). A limit of 50% of PCV equity (PCV - user circulating FEI) would be authorized under this framework.\n\nIf approved by the community, this will include a single combined DAO vote for:\n* 2.5M Kashi FEI-ETH\n* 2.5M Kashi FEI-TRIBE\n* 5M C.R.E.A.M FEI\n* 1.33M Olympus PoolParty FEI\n* 1M Index Coop Fuse Pool\n\nFuture lending integrations can be taken straight to the DAO without explicitly snapshotting each integration. Included will be future Kashi pairs and Fuse pools with partner protocols being approved for 1M FEI to bootstrap liquidity. The DAO should both be proactive in pursuing these partnerships and allow applications from other interested DAOs and protocols via the forum. This framework is not meant to be final by any means, and should be open to periodic review as markets evolve.\n \n## Voting Rules\nVoting will last 2 days. Beginning Saturday July 17th 12:00 PST, and ending Monday July 19th 12:00 PST.\nThis is a non-binding signal vote. Please keep in mind that snapshot votes can be changed but not withdrawn until the end of the voting period.\n\nThe two options to vote are:\n* Approve the light lending framework\n* Do not approve the light lending framework\n\nThis is a single choice vote, if option 1 wins the majority, we will submit a DAO proposal after the end of the snapshot vote for the listed integrations. Future integrations will also be taken straight to the DAO.",

      "content": "FIP: 3,3\nAuthor: GrantG\n\n[**Forum Discussion**](https://tribe.fei.money/t/fip-3-3-allocate-fei-to-the-olympus-pool-party/3401)\n\n[**Olympus Pool Party**](https://app.rari.capital/fuse/pool/18)\n\n# Summary:\nThis is a signaling vote to determine whether Fei Protocol should mint and supply 1,333,333.33 FEI to the Olympus Pool Party Fuse Pool, after Olympus has whitelisted Fei as an asset \n\n## Motivation:\n\nThe Olympus fuse pool allows for users to lend their sOHM to borrow assets such as DAI, and then lever up on their sOHM positions from there. FEI Providing a large amount of liquidity, with a low interest rate would increase user adoption of FEI through these levering positions. This partnership would not only serve to increase FEI’s use across DeFi, but showcases FEI’s ability to support projects as well. Olympus has shown itself to be a community powerhouse, with thousands of highly active and aligned members. This FIP will show our alignment with Olympus’s quest to be a strong reserve asset, benefiting all of the Ohmies by allowing them access to huge amounts of liquidity to borrow from, while simultaneously increasing circulating FEI supply, and acting as a marketing vehicle for FEI. \n\n## Specification:\n\nThis proposal is a two step process. The first step is for Olympus to whitelist FEI as an asset to be added to their Fuse pool with the same parameters as the other stablecoins hosted there (collateral factor: 65%, reserve factor: 10%), this will have to be executed on their end. After FEI is whitelisted and added as an asset, FEI Protocol will mint and supply 1,333,333 FEI to the pool.\n\n## Voting Rules\n\nVoting will last 2 days. Beginning Friday July 16th 18:00 PST, and ending Sunday July 18th 18:00 PST.\n\nThis is a non-binding signal vote. Please keep in mind that snapshot votes can be changed but not withdrawn until the end of the voting period.\n\nThe two options to vote are:\n\n1. Mint and allocate 1,333,333 Fei to the Olympus Pool Party\n2. Do not allocate Fei to the Olympus Pool Party.\n\nThis is a single choice vote, if option 1 wins the majority, we will submit a DAO proposal after the end of the snapshot vote.",

The goal is to tweak the parameters to attract borrowers.\n\n# Motivation\n\nThe FeiRari pool’s existing parameters are relatively conservative and not friendly enough to be competitive in terms of borrowing. We have analyzed the various parameters and come to the conclusion that to make the pool more efficient, we must propose some changes. \n\nThe plan is to make them more aggressive in order to attract borrowers, as the DAO can supply FEI to bootstrap the market. We will also take advantage of this opportunity to tune the parameters of the other three assets in the pool. We have seen the performance of the pool over two weeks and now we are ready to update the parameters to drive higher volume to it. The DAO has already supplied 10M FEI upon taking over the pool and it is possible it supplies even more FEI in the future. This makes this parameter tuning exercise more focused on attracting FEI borrowers.\n\n# Specification\n\n**Update existing FeiRari Fuse Pool Parameters:**\n1. Reduce Close Factor from 50% to 33%\n2. Reduce Liquidation Incentives from 10% to 8%\n3. Increase FEI, ETH and DAI collateral ratio from 75% to 80%\n4. Update to FEI IRM\n    1. Reduce FEI Base Rate from 2.73% to 0%\n    1. Reduce FEI Initial Slope Multiplier from 36.40% to 7%\n    1. Reduce FEI Second Slope Multiplier from 1650% to 400%\n5. Update to TRIBE IRM\n    1. Reduce TRIBE Base Rate from 2.73% to 0%\n    1. Reduce TRIBE Initial Slope Multiplier from 53.75% to 20%\n    1. Reduce TRIBE Second Slope Multiplier from 4000% to 400%\n6. Update to DAI IRM\n    1. Reduce DAI Base Rate from 2.73% to 0%\n    1. Reduce DAI Initial Slope Multiplier from 53.75% to 10%\n    1. Reduce DAI Second Slope Multiplier from 4000% to 400%\n7. Update to ETH IRM\n    1. Reduce ETH Base Rate from 2.73% to 0%\n    1. Reduce ETH Initial Slope Multiplier from 53.75% to 8%\n    1. Reduce ETH Second Slope Multiplier from 4000% to 400%\n\n# Voting Rules\n\nVoting will last 2 days.\n\nThis is a non-binding signal vote.

      "content": "## Forum Discussion\nhttps://tribe.fei.money/t/saddle-d4-tribe-rewards/3351\n\n## Abstract\n\nAllocate 5M TRIBE from the DAO Treasury to liquidity mining incentives on the Saddle d4 pool (LUSD, alUSD, FRAX, FEI) for constant distribution over 1 year. Saddle is a stablecoin optimized AMM similar to Curve. The goal of this pool is to provide liquidity to top decentralized stablecoins to help reduce ecosystem dependence on USDC/USDT. Any TRIBE allocated would be paid back to the treasury if we upgrade the staking rewards per the existing discussion here: https://tribe.fei.money/t/masterchief-staking-rewards-upgrade/3350\n\n## Motivation\n\nThere is a kicked off discussion around adjusting the current staking rewards distribution by leveraging a new rewards contract similar to SushiSwap’s MasterChef. This will take time to implement and audit. In the meantime we have an opportunity to collaborate with some of the best decentralized stablecoins (FRAX, LUSD, alUSD) in a Saddle d4 (decentralized four) pool. Saddle is a StableSwap AMM which has low slippage for pegged assets.\n\n## Proposal\n\nThis proposal would allocate 5M TRIBE from the DAO treasury for rewards to liquidity providers of the d4 pool. These TRIBE will be paid back to the treasury from the existing staking rewards if and when the upgrade to the new staking system takes place.\n\nThe specific staking rewards contract to be used is under development by Frax Finance, and will allow stakers to earn all 4 governance tokens simultaneously.\n\nFor example, an amount of 5,000,000 TRIBE (~3m USD) would translate to a 6% APY on 50m TVL. If all 4 tokens allocate a similar amount of rewards, then the APY would jump to 24% for this amount of TVL. This represents ~3.3% of the current staking rewards distribution.\n\nBenefits to the Tribe:\n\n  - Additional liquidity for FEI\n  - Peg support through StableSwap AMM\n  - Alignment with top decentralized stablecoins\n  - Reducing industry dependence on USDC by providing liquidity between viable alternate stables\n\n## Specification\n\nThe exact steps executed by this proposal would be the following :\n\n - Move 5,000,000 TRIBE from the DAO Treasury to the joint StakingRewards contract\n\n## Voting Rules\n\nVoting will last 2 days.\nThis is a non-binding signal vote. Please keep in mind that snapshot votes can be changed but not withdrawn until the end of the voting period.\n\nThe two options to vote on are:\n\n   5M TRIBE @ Saddle D4\n   No TRIBE to Sadddle D4\n\nThis is a single choice vote, if option 1 wins the majority, we will submit a DAO proposal after the end of the snapshot vote.\n",

      "content": "# Forum Discussion\nhttps://tribe.fei.money/t/fip-9-staking-eth/3331\n\n# Basic Summary\nThe following is a proposal to invest 10,000 ETH from PCV into stETH (represents ~4% of PCV).\n\nLido allows users to stake ETH on the Ethereum beacon chain to earn daily rewards. The stETH is a token that represents staked ether using Lido and is pegged 1:1 to the ETH. Its value is the result of initial deposit plus staking rewards less penalties. The daily staking rewards are paid in stETH.  \n\n# Motivation\nThe main purpose of this initial investment into stETH is earning yield to grow PCV, which can help FEI Protocol to protect the peg and drive FEI utility and adoption.  \n\nDeploying a portion of PCV in a yield-bearing asset like stETH will provide PCV with another source of value appreciation, while remaining long in ETH and will strengthen our positioning in the stable coin business.\n\nLiquid staking protocols, such as Lido, allow users to earn staking rewards without locking assets or maintaining staking infrastructure. Users of these protocols can deposit tokens and receive tradable liquid tokens in return. With Lido, users receive rewards (subject to penalties, if any happen) in the form of increased/decreased stETH balance in their wallets. \n\nETH2 staking rewards are appealing as the yields are interesting and reasonably predictable. From the available options for Fei Protocol to participate in ETH 2.0 staking, stETH has the following benefits: liquidity, low technical requirements for implementation, competitive fee structure, community governance, and increasingly, proven stability. \n\nLido has established itself as the third largest ETH depositor to the Beacon chain, only behind the centralized exchanges, Kraken and Binance.\n\nThe current APR after Lido’s fees in stETH is 5.9%, with ETH2 validator rewards currently sitting at 6.4%.\n\nOur scenario and risk analysis of stETH are available in the forum post: https://tribe.fei.money/t/fip-9-staking-eth/3331\n  \n# Specification\nThis proposal will add a new contract to the protocol: the EthLidoPCVDeposit. This PCVDeposit manages the movement between ETH and stETH. On deposit, it will choose the most advantageous between:\n\nA. Direct staking on Lido (1:1 stETH for each ETH deposited), or\nB. A swap in the Curve steth pool (that can potentially give more stETH than ETH on trade).\n\nShould we need to recover the ETH invested before ETH2.0 goes live, this PCVDeposit allows us to swap stETH back to ETH, again using the Curve pool. Today, a 10,000 stETH swap to ETH on the Curve pool gives 9,987 ETH, or 13 ETH of slippage, which should be around 10 days of yield farming from stETH.\n\nThe exact steps executed by this proposal would be the following :\n\n* Move 10,000 ETH from the EthPCVDripper (currently holding ~140,000 ETH that stay idle) to the new EthLidoPCVDeposit.\n* Deposit the 10,000 ETH to stETH either by direct staking on Lido or a Curve swap, depending on what’s more advantageous at the time of execution of this proposal.\n\n# Voting Rules\nVoting will last 2 days.\nThis is a non-binding signal vote. Please keep in mind that snapshot votes can be changed but not withdrawn until the end of the voting period.\n\nThe two options to vote on are:\n* 10,000 ETH @ LIDO stETH\n* No deployment on LIDO stETH\n\nThis is a single choice vote, if option 1 wins the majority, we will submit a DAO proposal 24h after the end of the snapshot vote. \n",

      "content": "## Forum Discussion\nhttps://tribe.fei.money/t/fip-4-reinstate-remove-direct-incentives/3283 \n\n## Basic Summary\nRemove direct incentives from Fei Protocol functionality\n\n## Motivation\nAnalysis and discussion in the community has demonstrated a number of drawbacks to the direct incentive approach.\n\n* *Undermines the purpose of a stablecoin* - Nearly all use-cases for stablecoins are based on the coin maintaining its worth at a pegged value. In particular, it is desirable for stablecoins to be redeemable at the pegged value in a highly liquid manner. Direct incentives break this model. It's easy to imagine users dismissing FEI for other stablecoins that have no threat of penalized redemption.\n\n* *Inconsistent user experience* - To perform FEI swaps on uniswap routing through the FEI-ETH pair, users must increase slippage on their trades. New users might not know they need to do this. They might wonder why their trades fail, and they might also wonder why the amount of FEI swapped is different from their expectations. Even for experienced users, the optimal slippage rate might be difficult to determine, and this information cannot be integrated into the uniswap user interface.\n\n* *Isolated to Primary Exchange* - Direct incentives only work on the UniswapV2 FEI-ETH pair. To onboard a new exchange, we would have to write new code specific to that AMM. Many new AMM designs would not support direct incentives because of complex or nondeterministic curves.\n\n* *Breaks composability with other protocols* - Direct incentives break standard ERC20 behavior and compromise integration into other protocols. Some price oracles cannot properly report the price of FEI. Aggregators such as Coingecko post a large warning about FEI that could be a deterrent for new users researching the protocol. \n\nDirect incentives are currently disabled, this vote would signal support to permanently remove them. By removing direct incentives, FEI holders can be confident in a highly liquid stablecoin without the worry of incurring a penalty for selling. This would allow the protocol to move forward with the bonding curve and reweights as the primary peg maintenance mechanisms, and focus on building out the FEI ecosystem through PCV deployment.\n\n## Specification\nThe following action would be included in future DAO proposals until one passes, to spare an extra on-chain vote for a non-essential change. The UniswapIncentive currently has neither Minter nor Burner access so it is effectively disabled. The below change would lower gas costs for FEI traders on Uniswap.\n\nUnset the UniswapIncentive contract from the FEI incentive map\n\n* Target: 0x956F47F50A910163D8BF957Cf5846D573E7f87CA\n* Method: setIncentiveContract(address)\n* Value: 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000\n\n## Voting Rules\nVoting will last 3 days ending on Sunday, June 20 at 12pm PT\n\nThis is a non-binding signal vote. Please keep in mind that snapshot votes can be changed but not withdrawn until the end of the voting period.\nThe two options to vote on are:\n\n* Yes, remove direct incentives\n* No, keep direct incentives\n\nIf this vote passes with a Yes majority, the specified changes will be included in a future DAO vote. If the vote passes with a No majority, continue discussions oriented towards an implementation with potential modifications.",

      "content": "# Forum Discussion\nhttps://tribe.fei.money/t/chainlink-oracle-integration-discussion/3316 \n\n# Basic Summary\nSwitch the primary ETH-USD oracle to Chainlink from the ETH-USDC TWAP currently used. This would enhance accuracy, reduce manipulation resistance and reduce reliance on USDC.\n\n# Motivation\nChainlink has a robust oracle network, which leverages data from both on- and off-chain sources. Many other Ethereum projects use and collectively support the Chainlink ETH/USD oracle, including Synthetix, Aave, Set Protocol, Loopring, and many more.\n\nBecause it uses a 50bps deviation threshold as trigger rather than a static TWAP, the Chainlink oracle responds faster to market volatility. This would help enhance the peg and protocol mechanisms.\n\nCurrently the protocol use oracles in determining:\nThe bonding curve purchase price for FEI\nThe reserve stabilizer sale price for FEI\nThe price to reweight to\nThe slippage tolerance on Uniswap swaps and liquidity provision\n\nAdditionally, upgrading to chainlink would save gas for users during oracle updates in FEI swaps on Uniswap and other protocol flows. \n\nThe oracle to be used is the ChainlinkOracleWrapper written by @eswak here: https://github.com/fei-protocol/fei-protocol-core/pull/100 \n\n# Specification\nThe following actions would be taken on the DAO:\n\n1.

It also includes a 10 million FEI deployment into the pool to bootstrap liquidity for borrowers. It will remain in the pool for at least 9 months while a market forms, to benefit from the reduced admin fee on the Rari side.\n\n## Motivation\nLending is a key use case for any stablecoin and Rari Capital Fuse was the first lending integration for FEI. Fuse allows for anyone to control the asset and interest rate parameters in a Compound-like pool. The current pool is owned by Tetranode and ChainLinkGod. It holds FEI, TRIBE, ETH and DAI.\n\nIf Fei Protocol were to acquire ownership of the pool it could add future PCV assets to provide a native way to get leverage and yield using FEI and protocol-owned liquidity.\n\nAdditionally, by supplying 10M FEI to the pool the DAO would be subsidizing borrowing rates and earning yield off of the early market formation. This could bootstrap future yield for FEI holders and drive FEI utility and cash flow for TRIBE. The Rari DAO is currently snapshotting a proposal to lower the admin fee from 10% to 6% given this TVL commitment for at least 9 months. This further tightens the spread to make interest rates as competitive as possible.\n\nThe principal and interest earned by the protocol would be burned if the liquidity is ever withdrawn\n\nThis proposal would mark the first instance of the DAO itself minting FEI to provide liquidity in another protocol. This pattern would not need any new code, as the DAO itself will be the holder and owner of the position.\n\nIn the future the community can consider setting an admin fee for the protocol to generate additional cash-flow from the pool, but for the current proposal there will not be a change to the admin fee.\n\n## Specification\n\nThe DAO proposal steps would include:\n 1. Accept admin rights on the Fuse pool\n 2. Mint 10M FEI to the timelock\n 3. Approve the Fuse pool to move 10M FEI\n 4. Deposit 10M FEI to Fuse\n\n## Voting Rules\nVoting will last 2 days ending on Saturday, June 12 at 12pm PT\nThis is a non-binding signal vote. Please keep in mind that snapshot votes can be changed but not withdrawn until the end of the voting period.\n\nThe two options to vote on are:\n - Yes\n - No\n\nIf this vote passes with a Yes majority, the specified changes will be submitted for an on-chain DAO vote.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

      "content": "# Forum discussion\nhttps://tribe.fei.money/t/fip-6-pcv-initial-stable-coin-investment/3249\n\n# Basic Summary\nThis proposal is to invest 40k ETH from the PCV into stablecoins.\n\nThis FIP has been prepared by @eswak and @bruno. We would like to thank @siddharth for initially pointing to the urgency of diversifying into stable coins and for the valuable feedback from other community members such as @pavel, @arcology and @ferdinand_fuzzgellan. We would also like to thank @countvidal and @Matthew_Graham for the initial discussions about stablecoins investment, and the core team for helping us draft this formal proposal.\n\n# Motivation\nThere has been numerous discussions on how to diversify the PCV on the community channels (Discord, Discourse), and the channel #fip-6-stablecoin-diversification has been quite active recently. \n\nWe presented scenarios considering investments from 10% to 25% of PCV into stablecoins, and the community started discussing what would be the appropriate size.  We think there is a middle ground in the community at 40k ETH to buy stablecoins. \n\nThere are currently 266 M FEI in circulation, of which 135 M are timelocked. Assuming 2500$/ETH, the 40k ETH allocation would make the PCV acquire US$ 100M of stablecoins. Those stablecoins would hedge the risk for ~75% of the circulating non-timelocked FEI. The PCV is currently sitting at ~276k ETH, so by converting 40k ETH, we would be converting 14.5% of the PCV.\n\nThis investment would reduce the daily volatility of PCV from 6.5% to 5.5% and reduce the Expected Shortfall from 15.9% to 13.6%, as discussed in the forum posts.\n\nAfter discussions with the community, we selected two possible options of stablecoin investments, DAI and USDC, for the following reasons:  \n\n- Highly liquid trading pools on Uniswap and SushiSwap. USDC is the most liquid centralized stablecoin and DAI the most liquid decentralized stablecoin.\n- They are the most used in the lending protocols and in stable pools\n- In the risk assessment done by lending protocols, USDC is the less risky centralized stablecoin and DAI the less risky decentralized stablecoin\n\nOur updated risk analysis for each cryptoasset provided the results shared on the Discourse post : https://tribe.fei.money/t/fip-6-pcv-initial-stable-coin-investment/3249/22?u=bruno\n\nSo here is a snapshot to confirm the community's interest on this investment, and finalize the choice of stablecoins to acquire.\n\n# Specification\nThis proposal adds a new “PCV Swapper'' contract to the protocol. This contract can swap ETH or ERC20s held in the PCV to other ERC20s or ETH, using Uniswap v2 or Sushiswap markets. Anyone can call the swap() function after a certain time has passed to help the protocol swap its PCV assets, and receive a FEI incentive to cover gas costs.\n\nThe code has been reviewed by the core team and audited by Consensys Diligence. The audit and code changes should be done this week, and we plan a DAO vote 48 hours after the start of snapshot vote, if it is successful.\n\nSwaps will happen on Sushiswap market, in chunks of 40 ETH every 10 minutes. The incentive to call the swapper will be 50 FEI. That should make the PCV Swapper(s) acquire the ~1M stablecoins over the course of 1 week. A slippage protection of 1% will be used based on the Chainlink ETH/USD oracle.\n\nSteps included in the DAO proposal:\n- Grant PCV Swapper(s) the minter role to enable the FEI incentive on swap() call.\n- Call setReceivingAddress() on the PCV Swapper(s) to make them target themselves when swapping tokens. They will hold the tokens until a next proposal re-affects them to different contracts of the protocol.\n- Withdraw 40,000 ETH from the EthPCVDripper to the PCV Swapper(s). The dripper currently holds 127k ETH.\n- Call wrapETH() to wrap PCV ETH to WETH and allow swapping\n\n# Voting Rules\n\nVoting will last 2 days.\n\nThis is a non-binding signal vote. Please keep in mind that snapshot votes can be changed but not withdrawn until the end of the voting period.\n\nThe three options to vote on are:\n- 40k ETH @ 100% DAI\n- 40k ETH @ 50% DAI, 50% USDC\n- No stablecoin purchase\n\nThis is an approval vote. You can check multiple options if you are comfortable with multiple choices. The option with the most votes will be proposed to the DAO. If option 3 wins, we will not submit the proposal to the DAO and continue discussions.\n",

      "content": "# Forum Discussion\nhttps://tribe.fei.money/t/fip-2-fei-redemption-tribe-staking/3033 \n\n# Basic Summary \n\nThis proposal aims to unify FEI and TRIBE holders around the common goal of FEI’s long-term stability and success by:\n* Offering $0.95 redemption of FEI using 300k ETH from PCV, delivered in batches to the ReserveStabilizer contract in hourly batches of 5000 ETH\n* Doubling staking rewards by allocating 100 million TRIBE to the existing FEI-TRIBE staking pool, linearly decreasing over two years\n\n# Motivation\n\nThis proposal aims to create strong peg support for FEI at a $0.95 floor. It creates a tight range in which reweights and direct incentives can operate once reinstated. It also increases the effective collateralization ratio of the protocol. TRIBE voting to support FEI will restore confidence in FEI’s peg and the community behind it.\n\nThis proposal strikes a balance between the effective exchange rate of the “simplified undo button” proposal and $1 redemption for FEI. Reweights and direct incentives can operate more efficiently with a smaller gap to close in subsequent proposals.\n\nThe allocation of an additional 100 million TRIBE from the DAO Treasury to staking rewards is an essential part of this proposal with multiple objectives. It offers TRIBE holders who believe in the long-term potential of the project a way to significantly increase their stake in it. Additionally, it generates demand for FEI, which helps support the peg and retain PCV. \n\nThe amount of ETH (300k) is intended to be able to redeem all non-staked or timelocked FEI even with a drop in ETH price. Dripping in the ETH in hourly batches of 5000 ETH intends to:\n* prevent a supply shock to the market\n* decrease the profitability of attacking the oracle\n* allows the contract to be paused by the Guardian in the event of an issue without exposing all of the allocated ETH at once\n\nThe dripper will not be able to drip if there is still at least 5000 ETH in the contract to protect against leaving a large reservoir of ETH in the reserve stabilizer. This again decreases the profitability of attacking the oracle.\n\nThis proposal also includes returning of Ocean-X's FEI from https://etherscan.io/tx/0xdcfe606b9ed3acc596b8a2b58a1e3fd8b0b6be343526e4d6ed861f52b83850e0.\n\n# Specification\nThe EthReserveStabilizer implementation would be deployed with a $0.95 price relative to the oracle. The EthPCVDripper would point to the reserve stabilizer with parameters to drip 5000 ETH every hour through an open drip() function. It would be seeded with 300k ETH which could be withdrawn back to the DAO.\n\nThe steps included in the DAO proposal: \n* Grant the Timelock the PCVController role indefinitely (to allow PCV movement through governance)\n* Withdraw 300,000 ETH from the EthUniswapPCVDeposit to the EthPCVDripper\n* Set the EthReserveStabilizer to a Burner (so that FEI transfers don’t need approval from the caller)\n* Grant the Timelock the Minter role indefinitely (to allow DAO payments in FEI)\n* Send 127,629.12841 FEI to 0x6a595d87edd494c6d0fd1e80c1aeee52e22bab66 to effectively undo this transaction: https://etherscan.io/tx/0xdcfe606b9ed3acc596b8a2b58a1e3fd8b0b6be343526e4d6ed861f52b83850e0\n* Send 100,000,000 TRIBE to the FeiRewardsDistributor contract from Core (the DAO treasury)\n\n# Voting Rules\n\nVoting will last 2 days ending on Friday, April 23 at 4pm PT\n\nThis is a non-binding signal vote. Please keep in mind that snapshot votes can be changed but not withdrawn until the end of the voting period.\n\nThe two options to vote on are:\n\nYes\nNo\n\nIf this vote passes with a Yes majority, the specified changes will be submitted for an on-chain DAO vote.\n",

      "content": "This is meant as a soft vote to signal support for the proposal on Discourse from user HittingBOMBS:\n\nhttps://tribe.fei.money/t/proposal-simplified-undo-with-no-edge-cases/2881\n\nI am writing this proposal that is my best interpretation of @joey 's recent comments.\n\nIt is clear from the team’s comments regarding the snapshot vote, the best step forward is to find a way to get back to the peg. To do that, we need to relieve sell pressure and/or reweight. This will create utility for FEI as it makes integrations feasible.\n\nUnfortunately it seems the first proposal was too favorable to FEI holders relative to TRIBE holders. In light of Joey’s comments about keeping implementation simple and not having to deal with many edge cases, but liking the “Undo Proposal” in spirit, here is simplified proposal.\n\nFor every 1 ETH committed to genesis, participants received:\n\n|TRIBE/ETH|156.437|\n|FEI/ETH|2,037.768|\n\nAllow a redemption in this ratio, with no edge cases to deal with. For every 156.437 TRIBE + 2037.768 FEI redeemed, the redeemer receives back 1 ETH. Anyone can redeem, including people who did not participate in genesis. This simplifies the implementation significantly.\n\nThis is significant concession relative to the first vote, which was 56%-44% before the team voted No Change. This means it would have passed if the team voted the other way. Hopefully these tweaks make it agreeable to enough people to proceed.\n\nWhat happens with the redeemed TRIBE can be decided by the DAO, but I reckon a good use of it would be to distribute it to TRIBE/FEI holders who do not redeem. The specifics of that need to be discussed; perhaps weighting it towards pre-swappers is most fair. Open to suggestions.\n\nThis proposal has many pros in line with the long-term success of the protocol:\n+gives fast money an exit without any profit, and doesn’t leave a bad stain on the project. Great for optics long-term. Reduces the bad taste of people, retains them as potential FEI holders in the future.\n+relieves significant sell pressure below the peg, helping achieve the peg in the near future\n+makes concessions to TRIBE holders who want to stick around for the long-term and see this project flourish, while flushing out the participants who have no intention to stick around long-term or add any value (The TRIBE will be united and strong)\n+allows for a simple implementation, which helps with both safety and creates an expedient option for many. This is helpful as all will be less exposed to ETH volatility.\n\nThe only downside is that the PCV will be reduced; however, with reweights that is inevitable and this proposal strikes a happy medium that compensates people who stick around. Reminder that the protocol is still significantly overcollateralized, and this proposal will increase the collateralization ratio, making Fei Protocol even healthier.\n\nThere are of course people out there who have traded FEI/ETH FEI/TRIBE TRIBE/ETH etc, and therefore do not have the proper ratio to fully redeem even if they participated in genesis. There are also people who have purchased FEI or TRIBE post-genesis. In these cases, they can adjust their holdings on market into significant liquidity if they so choose. They can partially redeem what they do have. If not, they can stick around, receive some of the redeemed TRIBE, and see what happens with reweights.\n\nI’m open to suggestions on some ways to tweak this, and on what to do with redeemed TRIBE.",

      "title": "FIP-1: Reserve Stabilization",
      "content": "## Forum Discussion\nhttps://tribe.fei.money/t/reserve-stabilization/1793 \n\n## Basic Summary\nFei Protocol is currently paused while the vulnerabilities in the direct incentive and reweight system are addressed. This proposal aims to allow for direct redemption of FEI for ETH from the PCV to release sell pressure to support the peg. \n\nThere are currently ~2 billion FEI of which ~1.2 billion are owned by FEI Protocol and ~200 million are timelocked in the TRIBE-FEI pool. The ~$950m PCV can directly support a FEI price of up to $1 for all user redemptions, with an excess of collateral.\n\n## Proposal\nThe mechanism of this proposal would withdraw 350,000 ETH to a contract which offers to buy outstanding FEI at the agreed upon price, $1 or $.90, of ETH relative to the oracle price. If this buffer gets exhausted the Tribe community can vote to allocate more PCV to the same contract in a subsequent proposal.\n\nIf this proposal succeeds, FEI's stability mechanism will be temporarily altered to be reserve stabilization via ETH PCV. This would remain in effect until at least the existing mechanism has been improved and all changes are voted on and audited.\n\nReserve stabilization can become a core primitive piece of FEI's architecture, with topping up of reserves coming from yield on PCV deployments or growth in FEI supply. \n\nThis proposal will also send 127,629 FEI to Ocean-x to effectively undo this transaction: https://etherscan.io/tx/0xdcfe606b9ed3acc596b8a2b58a1e3fd8b0b6be343526e4d6ed861f52b83850e0 \n\nSpecification\nThe reserve stabilizer implementation would be an OracleRef pointing to the UniswapOracle so that it can price the FEI exchange rate. There will be an additional discount rate which will be either 90% or 100% if $0.90 or $1.00 per FEI passes, respectively.\n\nThe steps included in the DAO proposal:\n1. Set the timelock to a PCVController indefinitely (to allow PCV movement through governance)\n2. Withdraw 300,000 ETH from the EthUniswapPCVDeposit\n3. Deposit 300,000 ETH to the EthReserveStabilizer\n4. Set the EthReserveStabilizer to a Burner (so that FEI transfers don’t need approval from the caller)\n5. Set the timelock to a Minter indefinitely (to allow DAO payments in FEI)\n6. Send 127,629.12841 FEI to 0x6a595d87edd494c6d0fd1e80c1aeee52e22bab66 to effectively undo this transaction: https://etherscan.io/tx/0xdcfe606b9ed3acc596b8a2b58a1e3fd8b0b6be343526e4d6ed861f52b83850e0 \n\n## Voting Rules\n\nVoting will last 3 days. This is a non-binding signal vote.\n\nThere are 3 options to vote for:\n\n$1.00 / FEI\n$0.90 / FEI\nNo change\n\nIf the “No change” option does not have a majority, the vote will be won by whichever of the two remaining options has the most votes. Subsequently the implementation would be audited and taken to a DAO vote on-chain.",
