      "title": "PhIP-10: Phonon DAO Launch Group (PDLG)",
      "content": "Summary\nThis Phonon Improvement Proposal 00 (PhIP-10) represents a formal proposal (to be voted on via Snapshot by Phonon holders) to authorize the formation of a Phonon DAO Launch Group (PDLG) with defined responsibilities and powers.\n\nThe PDLG’s members would be empowered to:\nPropose liquidity boosting activities on decentralized exchanges, and explore options for listings on CEXs when necessary and appropriate (without giving CEXs undue influence over the governance of the DAO and ensuring the DAO has financial resources required for long-term operations) for community approval\nEngage in prudent and appropriate marketing of the Phonon network to raise awareness and interest\nThe PDLG’s members will be at will and members of the DAO who choose to participate in meetings will be considered apart of the group and hold a voice in decisions.\nThe PDLG’s main goal will be to push Phonon to the point of a “Release” of the Phonon Application to be used by anyone.\nAt this point the PDLG would be dissolved and official DAO Working Groups will be responsible for guiding the DAO’s activities afterward.\n\nMotivation\nThe Phonon DAO, which was officially launched on December 17, 2021, is responsible for guiding the development and incentivizing the utilization of the Phonon protocol. Launching any new organization is a challenge, and the Phonon DAO is no different.\n\nI am proposing that the community approve a Phonon DAO Launch Group (PDLG) that would be empowered to engage in activities on behalf of the growing DAO community that are of key importance at this stage, including:\n\nImprove PHONON liquidity via incentive programs : PDLG would be responsible for developing an incentive program, securing technical resources to implement and bringing the program to the community for a rapid vote for implementation.\nThis would include using the DAOs treasury of DAI and ETH to Yield Farm. Whenever we have yielded more than $250. We will market buy $PHONON until our price is back within range of trading pairs. They $PHONON that is bought will be used in several ways. 1.) Create new liquidity with assets that have been earned with Yield Farming. 2.) Airdrop $PHONON to liquidity providers. 3.) Incentive new liquidity providers. 4.) Any left over will be returned to the DAO multisig.\nCrafting an initial PHONON marketing campaign : The campaign would help the crypto community understand the value of the PHONON network and how they can engage.\nDeveloping a roadmap of DAO activities This roadmap would commit the DAO to engaging in certain activities related to integrating the PHONON token into the PHONON protocol, strengthening the protocol by incentivizing hardware users (e.g., Lattice users) to help bootstrap the network, etc. Activities should be focused on ensuring the long-term health, sustainability (maintaining control over the majority of its Treasury and diversifying where necessary), and decentralization of the protocol.\nCreating partnerships for marketing and furthering the protocol with an allowance to spend up to 10% of $PHONON held in the multisig to accomplish this.\nExpanding the DAO Treasury Multi-Sig : Facilitating the process of nominating (and securing community approval of community members who will serve on the DAO Treasury multi-sig to increase security and decentralization) We currently need to replace at least 3 Multi-Sig signers. This group will appoint new individuals to the multisig.\n\nThe PDLG would consist of individuals from the community and the DAO Stewards who have the bandwidth to:\n\nEngage in monthly planning and implementation meetings around the PDLG’s priorities, and a willingness to take the lead on implementing in key priority areas\nCan participate in bi-weekly community calls (held on Discord) to report to the community on activities and progress\nDraft proposals and secure consensus on initial DAO priorities/infrastructure.\n\nThe PDLG will also need access to funds to help pay for marketing and other expenses. The PDLG will be allowed up to $2,600 USD value of assets a month to reimberse or spend for marketing and payment of work. Anything larger than $2,500/month will be put up for a seperate snapshot vote. Funds will be calcuated on discord and dispersed the first week of the month to pay for the prior months work.\n\nThe PDLG will also be able to use $DAI, $ETH, $SAFE in our treasury to Yeild Farm with. Up to 20k DAI and 6 ETH of our treasury to start the Yield Farming process laid out above.",

      "content": "The PWG1 proposal for a Product Working Group for a two term period (12 months) to fund and deliver on our DAO's Product Roadmap. \n\nThis Snapshot vote is for the forming and funding of the PWG1. \n\nPWG1 Proposes a team made up of Hinchy, Rake & Tuesdays along with a DAO Multisig\n\nCurrent DAO Development Needs\nPhonon technical roadmap has been developed in sync with GridPlus, and Phonon DAO needs to have the following accomplished in time for our upcoming Beta:\n\nTasks:\nTask 1: Fully Defined Technical Roadmap & Project Plan\n\nTask 2: Functioning “Change-Maker” (Proof of Concept, Design, +Beta)\n\nTask 3: On/Off-Ramp (Onboarding new Cryptocurrencies into Phonon)\n\nTask 4: CA Process Documentation + Tokenomics Design\n\nTask 5: eSim Feasibility Study\nTo accomplish these tasks, I propose the DAO form a funded Product Working Group (PWG).\n\nWe as a community have decided to double down on our community and bet on ourselves, a number of DAO members have stepped up to help fill this working group.\n\nInstead of forming a permanent Product Working Group, I propose we align each product working group with the leadership terms (Two 6 Month Terms) and focus on defined outcomes like the Tasks identified above.\n\nPWG 1 will fund the initial DAO Development Roadmap (Tasks 1-5).\n\nOrganizational Structure:\nThese tasks require developers with knowledge of the protocol and the ability to execute the tasks that the Phonon Community requires to progress.\n\n- Lead Community Developer: Hinchy\n\n- Lead Community Hardware Engineer: Rake\n\n- DAO Representative: Tuesdays\n\n- The Multi-Sig\n\n- DAO Leader\n\nTeam Overview:\nLead Community Developer (LCD):\nThe Lead Community Developer will have lead responsibility in accomplishing the tasks outlined by the DAO. They will have broad authority to define requirements, identify people/resources needed and work directly on product. They will work with the DAO leader on a process to add new features to the protocol and how to achieve the goals set out in the roadmap.\n\nThe LCD will define a detailed product roadmap for the organization, develop a robust and scalable architecture, lead the development of key Phonon infrastructure, ensure that the codebase is organized and useful and helpful to onboard new developers and extend future iterations to support different languages.\n\n(ie. Go CodeBase, Rust CodeBase, JS/TS CodeBase)\nThe LCD will be responsible for leading the Phonon software development team to build and maintain the source-code, while working closely with GridPlus’ engineers. The LCD will also ensure that all community bounties are listed and available to community developers.\n\nThe LCD will need to clearly communicate his/her choices, code, build and design language. This also assures that builds can be reproduced within different environments and by other programmers.\n\nCommunity Hardware Engineer (CHE)\nThe CHE will be responsible for the hardware-based requirements for the DAO, namely our certificate authority process. They will be responsible for completing the CA process document and forming a team to define Tokenomics for the benefit of the DAO.\n\nThe CHE will also develop and present an eSim feasibility study to determine the feasibility of a DAO-based Mobile Virtual Network Operator-based eSim process, or if there are any avenues open to the DAO to leverage an eSim.\n\nDAO Representative\nThe DAO representative is a named and trusted DAO community representative who will attend development meetings on behalf of the DAO to ensure the LCD and CHE are both accountable to their timeline. The DAO Representative will make recommendations to the multi-sig with regards to the progress of the DAO development roadmap.\n\nThe DAO representative will attend weekly stand-up meetings with the community devs and report findings to the community.\n\nThe Multi-Sig\nThe PWG1 Multi-sig will be made up of a group of 5 trusted DAO members responsible for overseeing the disbursement of funds to the PWG team members.\n\nThe DAO Leader\nThe DAO Leader will collaborate with the PWG1 team to ensure the DAO’s roadmap and products are aligned, and to ensure the interests of the DAO community are protected.\n\nBudget\nThe budget requested is for two 6-month terms, all members have agreed to be paid 100% in Phonon, which is a fantastic statement of belief in our project and provides meaningful relief to our treasury.\n\nLead Community Developer\nDisbursements for the LCD will be made monthly via SuperFluid or some other DAO tooling application to ensure prompt and accountable payment. Given the broad nature of this role, I believe a monthly payment is the fairest, given that many of the requirements are not going to be well defined and will require flexibility and agility.\n\nLead Community Developer Annual Comp: $180,000 paid in monthly disbursements of $15,000\n\nCommunity Hardware Engineer (CHE)\nThe requirements for PWG1 for CHE are two crucial deliverables, which have been outlined by the DAO Leader and GridPlus. Given that these are deliverable requirements, I believe the PWG1 Multi-Sig should compensate the CHE + Team (DAO is in discussion with a number of eSim/Javacard/Security Experts) based on the completion of the tasks outlined in the product roadmap.\n\nTask 4: CA Process Documentation + Tokenomics Design Compensation: $40,000\n\nTask 5: eSim Feasibility Study Compensation: $10,000\n\nAn additional Bonus of $5,000 worth of Phonon should be paid to the CHE for the successful completion of these tasks on time and on budget.\n\nDAO Representative\nThe DAO Representative is an oversight role with broadly defined responsibilities; therefore I suggest this role also be paid in a monthly stipend.\n\nDAO Representative Compensation: $24,000, paid in monthly disbursements of $2,000.",

      "title": "DAO Leader Application: Mickey",
      "content": "Link: https://gov.phonon.network/t/dao-leader-application/322\n\nDiscord Handle: Mickey#1707\nSummary Experience in DeFi/DAOs: Phonon DAO\n\nReason for applying: Provide a neutral transparent service for the DAO\nDescribe your involvement thus far in the Phonon DAO:\nMember of PDBG, DAO Multi-sig, Comms Multi-sig, Comms Leader.\n\nQualifications - What will you bring to the DAO as a Community Leader?\nMy goal is to unlock our potential, by supporting our talent and bringing in outside talent when necessary.\nConfirmation that the applicant can commit the time required for the position; Other projects they are working on: I will meet the 30 Hour per week requirement, and will hand any external duties in communication to another leader.\n\nOther Background: Incredibly passionate about Phonon, our community, our people, our talent, and our potential. 15 years’ experience building technology companies, exceeding $20M in annual revenue, raised $40M in equity, invested $5M of personal funds in early-stage companies. 7 years’ experience in crypto, believer in freedom, autonomy, and want to be of service.\n\nOther:\nPayments go beyond point-of-sale purchasing of your morning coffee. They also settle global accounts, provide capital markets, banking services, and more. Global payments infrastructure was built before the internet, and modern banking services essentially still leverage the same payments infrastructure as banks used 30 years ago.\n\nPhonon can leverage the world’s most modern technology to provide payments rails which are one hundred or even one thousand times cheaper, more secure, more scalable, and more efficient.\n\nThere is only one way for us to get from where we are to where we want to go, and that is together.\n\nMy Take on our Vision & Mission:\nVision: A payments protocol native to that which the internet was intended to be: open, transparent, secure, scalable, and continuously evolving.\n\nMission: To collectively build technology that leverages secure hardware to provide the most secure, robust, scalable, and low-cost payments infrastructure the world has ever seen.\n\nThe Role of a DAO Leader (as defined by PhIP-06)\n• Leading the process for updating the Long-Term Strategic Plan.\n• Provide operational services to the DAO, including budget management, engaging with the foundation, and legal counsel.\n• Work with various entities wishing to engage with the DAO as they arise, including VCs, manufacturers, and others.\n• Review, manage, and guide funding requests from Working Groups, should they arise.\n• Organize and co-lead Council Meetings.\n• Engage with Community Leaders as needed to keep them informed of DAO progress.\n• Engage with Working Group Leads as needed to keep activities synched, overcome operational roadblocks, etc.\n• DAO Leaders serve a mandate of two terms.\n• DAO Leaders are responsible for maintaining operational and strategic consistency as Working Group Leads cycle in and out of projects/initiatives.\n• Expected time commitment: 20-30 hours/week per Director.\n\nThe DAO Leader:.\n\nThe DAO Leader Position can be summarized as providing guidance, support and engagement. Guidance to working groups and working group leaders, providing support to members looking to utilize their talents, and engaging with outside entities and organizations. The most important role for the DAO leader in my mind is to make sure the people doing the work are fairly treated, and that we are properly unlocking our talent. I don’t believe we need a dictator to make decisions on everyone’s behalf, but I do think there is value in a neutral third party ensuring we reward and retain our best people and that we are in keeping with the ethos of decentralized autonomy.\n\nMy goals as the DAO leader would be to be neutral, objective, helpful, and attentive guide to help ensure our community, working groups, leaders and members have guidance, leadership and a voice.\n\nAs the DAO Leader, my goal would be to help define the objectives of the DAO, and then help make sure the most talented people available, within or outside of the DAO, are in a position to solve those issues. Once the right people are in the right seat, it would be my job to ensure they are rewarded and retained for the long term benefit of the DAO.\n\nAdditional Priority Tasks:\nIn addition to the defined responsibilities of the DAO Leader, I propose 4 additional tasks to be accomplished by year end.\nTask 1: Defining a Mission and Vision.\nTask 2: Organization and Governance Review\nTask 3: Build a product roadmap\nTask 3a: Appoint eSim task-force to build Phonon MVP using eSim.\nTask 4: Using our technology roadmap, define financial needs of the DAO, and if necessary, look to outside funding sources.\n\nOrganizational Structure:\nA DAO is different from a corporation or a collection of loose volunteers, with distinct advantages and disadvantages. At its best, a DAO leverages and unlocks global talent, and creates the world’s most innovative products. At its worst there are perverse incentives, political infighting, and moral hazards.\n\nTo unlock talent, and to build a peer-to-peer payments infrastructure for the world, Phonon must unlock it’s capabilities by organizing its talent.\n\nThe Example of Comms:\n\nIn April of this year we were facing a community that had quieted down, and we were in need of a project to help unite and connect our team. By working together on Comms, so many talented members were able to showcase their abilities, and including them in a multi-sig, governance and DAO payments helped us keep our most valuable asset, our community members.\n\nThe guiding principle of the Comms team is to have the comms leader define and set the communications goals for the DAO, with bounties or tasks set for DAO members to take down. To avoid any moral hazard, the comms leader cannot claim bounties, to avoid any temptation for self-dealing and to maximize our use and connection to our community.\n\nIn addition, the comms budget is held by the comms-multi-sig, where trusted DAO members can act as a check-and-balance to spending. I think the DAO leader should operate similarly, unable to claim bounties, but able to ensure that the hard-working members of the DAO are fairly rewarded and retained, while respectfully pushing back on items which aren’t a priority.\n\nLeadership Team:\nI will form an informal leadership team who can both provide insight, but also protect the interests of the DAO.\n\nTechnology Advisor: Rake\nResponsible to provide technical leadership to the DAO, ensuring the technical roadmap is sensible, that Phonon’s tech can meet the expectations of users, and to oversee the DAO’s repo, and ensure technical staff are delivering on behalf of the DAO.\n\nCommunity Advisor: Reddest Rooster\nThe DAO Lead is there to ensure our community is being listened to, that our members have a voice, and to provide assurances that I will be meeting the needs of the community. I believe Rooster is the heart and soul of the DAO and would like him in an advisory role to ensure we are never compromising our ethos as a decentralized community.\n\nI would like to include Rake and Rooster into this advisory group, but would also certainly like to expand it based on everyone availability.\n\nCompensation:\nI leave the compensation to the DAO to determine, and am happy to work without compensation for now until we have a clear idea of our budget and our compensation plan. I will also work to roll out a vested token compensation plan for all DAO members doing the work of the DAO.",

      "title": "Comms Working Group Funding",
      "content": "Over the past few weeks the Comms team has worked together to form a proposal for our efforts through the end of the year. \n\nThe Comms Team is Requesting a budget for critical items for the DAO including a Website, DAO Design Language, Coordination Tools, Discord + Social Management, Foundational Documents, Coordination PR & Events.\n\nDefining Organizational Terms:\nBelow are the terms which will be the building blocks of the comms structure. Before explaining the budget, structure and organization, I thought it would be prudent to explain each of the key elements of the Comms org structure.\n\nBounties:\nWe propose a structure similar to our pre-launch tasks, where a budget is defined broadly and tasks are outlined in the form of bounties. Payment for these bounties can be made in the form of $Phonon, and managed via a DAO tool like DeWork.\n\nMade Phonons:\nIn addition to payment in the form of $Phonon in bounties, we propose that people who complete bounties or tasks be allowed to purchase discounted vested tokens (or options) from the DAO treasury. This will ensure long-term relationships with the DAO and incentives for people to stick around and participate in a meaningful way. Only members who elect to get paid in $Phonon are eligible for Made Phonons, all those who elect to be paid in another token will have their allotment of Made Phonons returned to the treasury. \n\nThe total vested token’s are defined by a simple formula:\n\n(Total Bounty Paid) * (Option Multiple) = Total Available Governance Options for Purchase.\n\nTotal Bounty Paid: The amount of Bounty paid to complete a task.\n\nOption Multiple: Is the multiplier which determines the ratio of amount of bounty paid to the amount of options available to buy. This multiple is defined by the Comms leadership (more on this later).\n\nPhonon Basis: Is the spot price at the time the budget for Comms is submitted for approval.\n\nDiscount: The discount rate from the Phonon Basis\n\nExample:\nMary completes $100 worth of white paper bounties.\n\nThe option multiple is 2x. The Phonon basis is $1, and the Discount is 50%.\n\nGiven that Mary has claimed $100 worth of bounties, Mary may purchase up to $200 worth of Phonon from the Treasury.\n\nMary decides to activate her option 3 months later, and purchases 400 Phonons at a discounted price of $0.50 per Phonon.\n\nCommsigliere’s\nThe reason “Made” phonons are called “made” is because I am modeling comms a little bit like the Mafia in the United States in the late 1920s. Everyone can participate in comms, everyone can help, but there are special rewards for completing noteworthy tasks. To claim them, You have to get “made”, and getting made means doing something for the DAO. Once you are made, you have access to options you can execute within a defined period of time.\n\nCommsiglieres are the multi-sig signers of the Comms team. This family of members ensures that the DAO has a strong leadership group representing the various territories of the Comms teams: Bots, Dao Tools, Web, Social and Outreach. The 7 Commsiglieres are selected from the members which complete the most bounties in the previous Epoch, although the first 5 signers will be picked from active community members since our bounties have not yet been established.\n\nThe first 7 Members will be Hunt, Rake, Rush, Clamato, Tuesdays, Banan, & Mickey\n\nTransactions will require 4 of the 7 to process, with members recusing themselves in the event of large (over $10,000) transactions going towards themselves.\n\nCommsfather\nThe role of the Commsfather is to outline the strategic vision and mission for each Comms Epoch, and to ensure all the comms tasks are happening on time and at the standard required. The Commsfather must provide a strategic mission document with a spreadsheet outlining budget, tasks and timelines. This role cannot claim any bounties.\n\nI am putting my hat in the ring to be the Commsfather until the end of the year (when the governance cycle ends).\n\nMade Member\nMade Members are people who accomplish significant tasks for the DAO comms team, Made Members are eligible for discounted DAO token options, and to be members of the multi-sig.\n\nAssociate\nAssociates are people who help the DAO with smaller tasks, you must be an associate to be a Made Member. This is mostly for new people who join the DAO, as everyone in Comms has already gone above and beyond.\n\nBelow is the structure, budget, model for the team, compensation and Made Phonons\n\nStructure:\nThe comms team is essentially a bucket of bounties and rewards for accomplishing them. I suggest that the Comms be run in according to the governance schedule, with the Commsfather providing direction, administrative oversight, and Commsiglieres providing multi-sig oversight. Mob Members join up based on the bounties listed on the DAO Tools.\n\nThe Commsfather is responsible for creating a budget, submitting it to snapshot, and ensuring funds are moved into a multi-sig. The initial multi-sig will necessarily be made up of 5 people who are active in the community, but future multi-sigs should be made up of the people who have accomplished the most tasks for the DAO, along with the Commsfather.\n\nBounties are proposed by the Commsfather, and sent via the multi-sig which is controlled by the Commsiglieres. They can be changed and updated as necessary.\n\nThe Commsfather is responsible for helping to coordinate tasks, to ensure members accomplish the goals and to ensure the team members receive compensation from the budget.\n\nAnyone (other than the Commsfather) can take take down a bounty, and get “Made”.\n\nThe leadership structure of the Comms Team made up of Mickey (Commsfather), and 7 Multi-sigs: Rake, Clamato, Rush, Hunt, Banan, Mickey & Tuesdays (Commsiglieres) will ensure leadership is clearly defined.\n\nMickey will propose a budget, set goals, outline bounties and define the mission for Comms up until Dec 31st 2022.\n\nAny individual or Team seeking to take down a bounty will submit a proposal to the Commsigliere’s who will select the bounty awardee.\n\nAwardees will then work with Mickey to meet timelines, milestones and deliverables. Payment is processed when the Multi-sig accepts deliverables on behalf of the DAO.\n\nBudget:\nIn preparation for the launch of full Comms, I have written a budget, The budget written is broken down into two parts:\n\nInternal Comms : (Bots, DAO Tools, Onboarding, Discord, Documentation)\n\nExternal Comms: (Website, Social Media, Whitepaper(s), Investor Relations, Yellowpaper(s), Design, Art, UX/UI)\n\nThe Total Request for the Bounty budget is $230,000\n\nThe $230,000 Is broken down as follows:\n$155,000 in Phonon DAO Tokens\n$75,000 in Stablecoins.\n(This budget is broken down mostly in DAO tokens give the fact that the treasury is not yet diversified enough to make a huge conversion reasonable(\n-\nGoals and Budget Breakdown\n\nComplete a polished, world-class Phonon Website, one that combines the talent of the DAO with the world’s best design talent. ($50,000) (Phonon DAO has selected designer Ian Bradley (ex Apple, Marvel, Mastercard, Game of Thrones) as the lead designer , working with Rush)\nComplete a style guide, design language, card designs and cohesive branding for the DAO so that cards, websites, apps, wallets and all products of the DAO feel resemblant, cohesive and beautiful. ($50,000) (Ian Bradley will work with Mickey, Rush, Banan, Rake)\nImplement and manage DAO tools, Discord (Bots), Social Media. ($70,000)\nBoost Phonon’s presence by booking Podcasts, publications and social events. ($20,000)\nComplete documentation for the DAO, including: Whitepapers, Yellowpapers, Investment Documents. ($10,000)\nCoordination & Project Management (Commsiglieres+Commsfather) ($30,000)\nBudget:\n\nA poll was taken in comms and a 3x Multiple for options was requested.\n\nThe Total Request for Made Phonons from bounties (available for Purchase) is $690,000 (a 3x Multiple, paid in Phonon). Net possible cost (if all made phonons are claimed) is capped at $529,000 (paid in Phonons) because these are purchased according the the formula listed in the Medium article.\n\nIn Addition I am requesting to be able to purchase up $100,000 of Made Phonons under the same vesting and discount (but without the multiple) for my work until December, costing the DAO $70,000 Net.\n\nI suggest these bounties be sent initially from the DAO multi-sig, and then paid back from the unclaimed GRID tokens.\n\nThe Comms Budget and Made Phonon Model are available in the discourse link.
