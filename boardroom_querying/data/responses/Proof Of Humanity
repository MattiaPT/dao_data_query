This HIP establishes a deadline of 6 months for fulfilling the fork requirements, including the establishment of a functioning governance system and development of a new decentralized human registration protocol. Failure of one side of the fork to comply with above mentioned conditions will result in the enactment of the constitution and implementation of the decentralized human registration system of the compliant side of the fork, while compliance of both sides will trigger the implementation of HIP-74.\n\n**Motivation**\n\nIt has been more than one year since Proof of Humanity decided to pave the path towards a peaceful fork by approving HIP-74, but as of today, the conditions and developments needed for forking have not been completed.\n\n**Specification**\n\nA. Fork Deadline:\n\nThe deadline for fulfilling the above mentioned forking conditions will be 6 months, starting at 00:00 UTC of the next day after this HIP is approved (the “deadline”).\n\nB. Forking Conditions:\n\nBy the time of the deadline, each side of the fork must have:\n\n1. A Constitution or other similar agreement stating the basic governance rules of the respective side of the Fork.\n\n2. A working governance system, including:\n\n2.1. A forum to post and discuss proposals.\n\n2.2. A place (such as Snapshot) to vote on proposals.\n\n2.3. A method (such as a governor or a multisig) to enforce proposals.\n\n3. A working and new decentralized human registration system different from the Legacy Proof Of Humanity and different from the systems developed by other sides of the fork, on a leading side-chain or Layer 2 rollup, including:\n\n3.1. A method to register into the Proof Of Humanity fork.\n\n3.2. A method to query on-chain whether a human is registered or not.\n\n3.3. At least one functioning frontend allowing you to interact with this new system.\n\nC. Consequences of failure to comply with the forking conditions:\n\nIf by the time of the deadline one of the sides of the fork does not meet all the previous conditions:\n\n1. HIP-74 will no longer be binding.\n\n2. The funds will not be split.\n\n3. The Constitution and rules of the complying side of the fork will be enacted.\n\n4. The human registration system of the complying side of the fork will be implemented.\n\nIf neither side of the fork meets all the previous conditions by the deadline, an automatic extension of 6 months will be granted, and any potentially new side of the fork will be allowed to participate. In this event, the funds will be split equally among all compliant sides of the fork.\n\nD. Consequences of fulfillment of forking conditions:\n\nIf both sides of the fork meet all the previous conditions by the time of the deadline, the fork will be enacted according to HIP-74.\n\nAfter the fork, funds will be split with the only condition that they are used for the continuous development (both from a technical and ecosystem perspective) of Proof of Humanity’s respective side of the fork. Any deviation from the above mentioned purpose of the funds will empower the opposing side of the fork to pursue the retrieval of such funds through any available means.\n\n**Rationale**\n\nDeadline: 6 months is a reasonable time to finish the new version of PoH for each fork, especially considering that more than one year and a quarter has already passed. By establishing a deadline, both parties will be motivated to move forward as fast as possible, and the PoH community will be able to benefit from the v2 enhancements.\n\nForking Conditions: These are the minimum conditions to have a functioning decentralized human registration system. It would be unjust for the humans backing one side of the fork to find that the side they choose to be part of turns out to be a non functioning project. Therefore, minimum technical requirements as well as a commitment to using funds for the development of Proof of Humanity should be ensured on both sides before forking.",

It is also decided to repeal HIP-50 and HIP-63, which contributed to the governance blockage that led to a situation of ungovernability in the DAO and its subsequent division. \n\nIt is proposed to abandon the splitting of the DAO, the protocol and the treasury. It is also proposed to subsequently bring to a future vote the implementation of the v2 version of the protocol since this was contemplated in one of the proposals to be repealed. It is also contemplated that the funds received from the donation of the Gitcoin funding round to OpenPoH shall be returned to the Governor. \n\n### Motivation\n\nGiven that it has been 8 months since the approval of HIP-74 which established an organized process for the division of the DAO and the protocol and treasury and it has not yet been implemented. Taking into account that the problems that led to its approval are now non-existent and that there is no evidence of the existence of a project for the creation of \"Open Proof of Humanity\", it is necessary to move forward.\n\nIn order to move forward, it is also necessary to remove the obstacles that contributed to the ungovernable situation in the DAO. In this case, the existence of \"official groups\" and the formula of quadratic delegations which only caused that part of the votes of the registered humans were not taken into account, contributing an effective blockage to the governance.\n\n### Specification\n\nApproval of this proposal in Phase 3 will result in the following:\n* Repeal of **HIP-74: A Peaceful Fork** effective immediately.\n* Repeal of **HIP-63: Quadratic Delegations on the DAO Snapshot** effective immediately.\n* Repeal of **HIP-50: Clarify which of Proof of Humanity Telegram group belongs to the DAO** effective immediately.\n* Funds raised from the Gitcoin funding round for OpenPoH directed to address **0x2AF4125c8fE208a349ef78d3cb980308ab1Ed34f** shall be returned to the Governor address **0x327a29fce0a6490e4236240be176daa282eccfdf**\n* A proposal to migrate to a v2 version of the protocol shall be made in the future.",

This HIP will ammend and ratify the will of these two HIPs to continue its due process to become registration Policy. \n\n\n### Motivation\nTo end the lawfare attempt to block this HIPs to pass.\n\n### Specification\n#### Commits\nTwo commits will be submitted as a new pull request to the original policy (https://github.com/greenlucid/poh-policy/pull/1). These are created to ammend and ratify the HIPs already voted and approved. Both modifications are to be sent to the Governor with the same method specified in each of the HIPs, in such a way that both modifications are fit and properly done to be sent to the Governor. \n\n#### Anti-lawfare clause\nThe DAO will also manifest its will that these HIPs are to be merged with the policy and any attempts to challenge the submission to the Kleros Governor are to be treated as lawfare attempts. Kleros jurors (in the case of a challenge) are required by the force of this HIP to refuse to arbitrate in case of such a challenge appears. \n\nIf any minor typos or errors prevent the execution of this or future HIPs after its approval on Phase 3, the ammendments to these blocked HIPs are to be fast-tracked and bypass HIP-5 requirements, only requiring a new 24h Snapshot poll with the [Ammendment] tag and options \"Ammend the HIP\" or \"Revert to Phase 3\", along with the suggested modifications. \n\n#### Ammend to debureaucratize HIP-45 \nImplementation of HIP-45 is to be modified as to simplify the policy changes. All that is required to make an ammendment valid is to specify which characters are being modified from the original policy markdown file. Methods to do this include but are not limited to the use of version control tools like GitHub, as long as there is evidence that the tool itself has a reputation of trustworthiness. \n\n\n### Rationale\nPrevious attempts to implement the HIPs for policy change have met beaurocratic resistance, more specially so the ones that attempt to make the registry process less prone to innocent mistakes and whatever policy reduces the amount of disputes rised at Kleros Humanity Court. Kleros own governance process lacks all of these overkill mechanisms for their governance, so it does not make much sense to continue with such complicated policy change process. \n\n### Implementation\n\nImplementation already described above. \n\n# Traducción al castellano\n\n### Resumen simple\n\nEste HIP contrarrestará los intentos de bloquear dos Propuestas Vinculantes para llegar al gobernador de forma segura.\n\n### Resumen\nLas HIPs 78 y 58 están siendo bloqueadas para ser enviadas al Gobernador por un conjunto de ruidos de mala fe y burocráticos que entorpecen los procesos democráticos. Este HIP enmendará y ratificará la voluntad de estos dos HIPs para continuar su debido proceso para convertirse en Política de registro.\n\n### Motivación\nAcabar con el intento de lawfare de bloquear la aprobación de este HIP.\n\n### Especificación\n#### Compromisos\nSe enviarán dos commits como un nuevo pull request a la política original (https://github.com/greenlucid/poh-policy/pull/1). Se crean para enmendar y ratificar los HIPs ya votados y aprobados. Ambas modificaciones se enviarán al Gobernador con el mismo método especificado en cada uno de los HIPs, de tal forma que ambas modificaciones estén en forma y correctamente hechas para ser enviadas al Gobernador.\n\n#### Cláusula contra la ilegalidad\nEl DAO también manifestará su voluntad de que estos HIPs se fusionen con la política y que cualquier intento de impugnar el envío al Gobernador Kleros sea tratado como intento de lawfare. Los jurados de Kleros (en caso de recusación) están obligados por la fuerza de este HIP a negarse a arbitrar en caso de que aparezca tal recusación.\n\nSi alguna errata o error menor impide la ejecución de este o futuros HIPs tras su aprobación en la Fase 3, las enmiendas a estos HIPs bloqueados se realizarán por la vía rápida y eludirán los requisitos del HIP-5, requiriendo únicamente un nuevo sondeo de Instantánea de 24h con la etiqueta [Enmienda] y las opciones \"Enmendar el HIP\" o \"Volver a la Fase 3\", junto con las modificaciones sugeridas.\n\n#### Enmienda para desburocratizar el HIP-45\nLa aplicación del HIP-45 debe modificarse para simplificar los cambios políticos. Todo lo que se necesita para que una enmienda sea válida es especificar qué caracteres se modifican del archivo original de la política. Los métodos para hacerlo incluyen, entre otros, el uso de herramientas de control de versiones como GitHub, siempre que haya pruebas de que la herramienta en sí tiene una reputación de fiabilidad.\n\n### Justificación\nLos intentos previos de implementar los HIPs para el cambio de políticas han encontrado resistencia burocrática, más especialmente los que intentan hacer el proceso de registro menos propenso a errores inocentes y cualquier política que reduzca la cantidad de disputas surgidas en el Tribunal de Humanidad de Kleros. El propio proceso de gobernanza de Kleros carece de todos estos mecanismos exagerados para su gobernanza, por lo que no tiene mucho sentido continuar con un proceso de cambio de política tan complicado.\n\n### Implementación\n\nLa implementación ya se ha descrito anteriormente.",

      "title": "[Phase-2][Signalling] HIP-83 Invest in Yubiai",
      "content": "## Simple Summary\nYubiai is a marketplace developed by ProofOfHumanity community members, where you can buy & sell services, digital products and physical ones using crypto deploying on mainnet eth, gnosis and bnb, this will allow:\n\n1. Extreme low fees in commissions & gas in every transaction.\n2. People have the possibility to use their crypto to buy and sell in a secure and transparent way.\n3. People offer their services, physical and digital products globally.  \n\n\nTo support the development of the Yubiai Dapp, we would like to ask the PoH for funding in return for Yubiai Tokens & an increase in PoH Dapps and user adoption.\n\n## Abstract\nYubiai is a project born from the Proof of Humanity community that came together online to develop a web3 marketplace where you can buy everything with crypto. What was done so far?\n\n[Demo 3](https://prepro.yubiai.market/)\n[Landing 1](https://www.yubiai.market/)\n[Presentation 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuJ3WydMb1E)\nAt the core of Yubiai there are some protocols that give life to the platform:\n\n- Gnosis Chain/BNB/ETH builds new market mechanisms for decentralized finance. Their three interoperable product lines allow you to securely create, trade, and hold digital assets on Ethereum at very cheap gas fees. Yubiai deploying on those chains is a must, enjoy the p2p transactions of everything there is on our platform at the cheapest gas prices.\n- ProofOfHumanity 1 a sybil resistance protocol on the blockchain, a mechanism for social identity on ethereum.\n- Kleros Escrow, and the Dispute Resolver.\n- Kleros Curate. “ Is this item following the marketplace rules?” By creating a list, defining guidelines and putting curation in the hands of the community you make a marketplace to operate according to our own systems of rules.\n- TalentLayer 1 is the interoperability layer for work reputation. When you complete a job on Yubiai, you and the person you transacted with will give each other a review; growing your reputation over time. TalentLayer IDs allow freelancers on Yubiai to own your reputation as a soul-bound NFT. TalentLayer IDs are interoperable: your reputation can work on any integrated marketplaces. If you lose access to your wallet, your TalentLayer ID can be recovered to a new wallet via an emergency recovery process.  \n\nTo support the team, we are asking for funding as a form of invest for future tokens from PoH over 10 ETH.\n\n## Motivation\n1. Increase adoption of PoH. This will benefit PoH ecosystem and Yubiai users due to the low gas fees.\n2. Attract users and sellers to Yubiai.\n3. Add fee for every transaction (optional) to send to the PoH treasury.  \n\nOur goal is to provide a platform where buyers & sellers meet to transact in a secure, cheap & fast way. We will build a DAO in order to have project participants be in control over the project.\n\nWe believe that bringing together PoH and YubiaiDAO would be mutually beneficial to the community. By supporting the YubiaiDAO community in technical matters, such as [Gnosis Chain deployment](https://blockscout.com/xdai/mainnet/address/0xdE677961f2a802DF105d014B8D7042914bb780cf/contracts) and Zodiac integration, the launch of YubiaiDAO could be facilitated.\n\nTo enable the YubiaiDAO launch team to keep developing pre-launch, we propose a token swap in which PoH would transfer 10 ETH to support the project. The majority of the funding will go towards the development of the Yubiai Marketplace and marketing.\n\nMore information about YubiaiDAO can be found in a dedicated write-up at [Lite Paper 5 1](https://scythe-yarn-631.notion.site/Links-f792b511b11943c4925778b3a0905eb1).\n\n## Specification\n- PoH will invest 10 ETH.\n- Received funds will be managed within the DAO multisig at yubiai.eth.\n- The signers consist of core YubiaiDAO members. If interested, a representative from PoH can join the signatories.\n- yubiai.eth will hold the minter role for YBI tokens.\n- A portion of the revenues, including but not limited to transaction fees generated on the Yubiai Marketplace, will flow back to YubiaiDAO.\n- Deployment of the Yubiai Marketplace on Gnosis/BNB &ETH.\n## Rationale\nYubiai tackles peer to peer transactions of services, physical & digital goods, NFTs using crypto as currency. We believe that this use case hasn’t been developed enough (most projects focusing on financial applications). Others projects attempting to create marketplaces, do not have the protocols that we are leveraging in order to provide the best and safest UX as well as all the incentives that are in place, such as the lowest fees from each transaction, leveraging the Proof Of Humanity community and being able to get the most out of their offerings for the seller and get their needs met by the buyers. The marketplace business has huge adoption of the total crypto population.\n\n## Implementation\nOnce this HIP gets approved, the first release of 2.5 ETH requested for development and marketing will be sent to the Yubiai’s multisig, which will administer the funds: 0x17d79CF96896c4d2aa4d4a19a2c8dD08DaFd163D.\n\nDivided in 4 stages:\n\n_1st & 2nd release: would go for team salaries of dev and marketing, We will start with the implementation of the fee to the poh treasury.(at the end of the second stage the deploy of Yubiai on mainnet and gnosis will be live)\n\n_3erd and 4th release: will be for the final steps of the implementation(testing and auditing) of the fee to the poh treasury for each transaction.(would be optional)\n\n_ $YBI airdrop will be given to PoH users that buy or sell something on Yubiai.\n\n_10 ETH worth in DAI equally to 1:1 $YBI. i.e if at the moment of the first stage of the release eth worth 1550, then 1550 $YBI will be sent back to the PoH treasury. Capping at max 10 eth of worth i.e if 10 eth worth 15500 dai then 15500$YBI will be sent to the poh treasury at then end of the final stage.\n\nFunds Allocation Details\n\nTeam salaries\n\n7 ETH\n\nMarketing\n\n3 ETH (focusing 50% on the weeks before and during the launch). The rest to maintain a stable {but less intensive} (marketing effort for the rest of the year). This rest would be locked and would be unlocked progressively on time.\n\nOur plan to acquire users and get traction consists in an elaborate marketing plan to raise awareness of the project. This will consist of several ways to increase visibility and grow usage of the platform, such as through paid campaigns like Search Engine Marketing and Display Ads, collaborating with influential content creators and bloggers, promoting the product on social networks, implementing referral and affiliate programs, and hosting offline events such as meetups and workshops to build community and introduce new features to attendees.\n\nThe marketing plan will feature a timeframe of 4 weeks, which will consist of conveying the message about the project and building hype around it. This will be accomplished through live demos, Q&A sessions, and Twitter Spaces over the first 2 weeks. The following weeks will focus on having a strong presence throughout all social media platforms. Once we receive funding from investors and grants, we plan on further expanding our marketing push through collaborations with influencers and KOLs.\n\nAll in all, we want to ensure that there is no possibility of failure by simplifying the setup process so that it is easy for anyone to follow and execute. Let me know if you would like to see the latest version of the marketing plan.\n\nTotal 10 ETH",

Ambas modificaciones se enviarán al Gobernador con el mismo método especificado en cada uno de los HIPs, de tal forma que ambas modificaciones estén en forma y correctamente hechas para ser enviadas al Gobernador.\n\n#### Cláusula contra la ilegalidad\nEl DAO también manifestará su voluntad de que estos HIPs se fusionen con la política y que cualquier intento de impugnar el envío al Gobernador Kleros sea tratado como intento de lawfare. Los jurados de Kleros (en caso de recusación) están obligados por la fuerza de este HIP a negarse a arbitrar en caso de que aparezca tal recusación.\n\nSi alguna errata o error menor impide la ejecución de este o futuros HIPs tras su aprobación en la Fase 3, las enmiendas a estos HIPs bloqueados se realizarán por la vía rápida y eludirán los requisitos del HIP-5, requiriendo únicamente un nuevo sondeo de Instantánea de 24h con la etiqueta [Enmienda] y las opciones \"Enmendar el HIP\" o \"Volver a la Fase 3\", junto con las modificaciones sugeridas.\n\n#### Enmienda para desburocratizar el HIP-45\nLa aplicación del HIP-45 debe modificarse para simplificar los cambios políticos. Todo lo que se necesita para que una enmienda sea válida es especificar qué caracteres se modifican del archivo original de la política. Los métodos para hacerlo incluyen, entre otros, el uso de herramientas de control de versiones como GitHub, siempre que haya pruebas de que la herramienta en sí tiene una reputación de fiabilidad.\n\n### Justificación\nLos intentos previos de implementar los HIPs para el cambio de políticas han encontrado resistencia burocrática, más especialmente los que intentan hacer el proceso de registro menos propenso a errores inocentes y cualquier política que reduzca la cantidad de disputas surgidas en el Tribunal de Humanidad de Kleros. El propio proceso de gobernanza de Kleros carece de todos estos mecanismos exagerados para su gobernanza, por lo que no tiene mucho sentido continuar con un proceso de cambio de política tan complicado.\n\n### Implementación\n\nLa implementación ya se ha descrito anteriormente.",

      "content": "```\nHIP: 78\ntitle: Clarify mirrored images during registration \nauthor: Ludoviko\nstatus: Phase 3\ncreated: 2023-01-09\n```\n\n### Simple Summary\n\nThis HIP will update and specify in the Policy the \"orientation\" issue with the policy text. \n\n### Abstract\n\nAn increase in challenges using the mirrored images has become the target of bad actors exploiting the written policy. There is a need to update the policy so that this exploit is removed.\n\n### Motivation\n\nMirrored images are not a valid cause for a profile challenge, since both human and computer vision are able to perfectly distinguish human faces when they are mirrored (source: check if you identify yourself every morning in the bathroom mirror). \n\nAs @ArkaYana mentioned in a message in Telegram, the reason for ammending the policy are straightforward: \"A mirrored image is a reflected version of an original image, while a rotated image is an image that has been rotated around a specific point. These terms refer to different ways of transforming an image, and they are not the same thing. A mirrored image is not necessarily a rotated image, and vice versa.\" \n\nMath-savvy people might argue that a mirrored image is a rotation over a three-dimensional plane, but that is beyond of what the policy is specifying and should not be used as an argument against registrants. \n\n### Specification\n\n1. A profile picture that is mirrored from the corresponding video is not cause for a challenge. \n2. A mirrored video when the spoken phrase confirmation is chosen is not grounds for a challenge. \n\n\n### Implementation\n\nFollowing what was specified in [HIP-45](https://gov.proofofhumanity.id/t/phase-3-hip-45-pdf-markdown/2232), the pull-request https://github.com/Proof-Of-Humanity/poh-docs/pull/6 will be merged. \n\nOnce merged, it will be uploaded to ipfs with the .MD extension:\n\n> When this HIP is merged, the Markdown document that was specified above, will be provided as it is, without rendering, as a plain Markdown file, on the MetaEvidence.  \n> We will obtain a new URL for the policy at ipfs. From now on, this url will be named “newPolicyIPFSURI”.\n\nOnce uploaded, the final “_registrationMetaEvidence” file will be also uploaded to IPFS, setting the fileURI to the “newPolicyIPFSURI”.\n\n[Actual registrationMetaEvidence](https://ipfs.kleros.io/ipfs/Qma9B2qMDTFcrXqeVUXKqDqqkgDJ2wjtHKUzw15ogv5x4w/registration.json)\n\n```\n{\n  \"category\": \"Curated List\",\n  \"title\": \"Proof of Humanity Registration Request\",\n  \"description\": \"A request to register the specified entry to a list of provable humans.\",\n  \"question\": \"Should the request to register be accepted?\",\n  \"fileURI\": <newPolicyIPFSURI>,\n  \"evidenceDisplayInterfaceURI\": \"/ipfs/QmSL8d82dMhcThwERWaF4LtmCa4hgV7TyPjAo4fKCzPVkv/index.html\",\n  \"rulingOptions\": {\n    \"type\": \"single-select\",\n    \"titles\": [\n      \"Yes\",\n      \"No\"\n    ],\n    \"descriptions\": [\n      \"Accept the request to register the entry.\",\n      \"Deny the request.\"\n    ]\n  }\n}\n```\n\nWe will obtain a new ipfs uri that we call “finalRegistrationMetaEvidenceURI”.\n\nThe final “_clearingMetaEvidence” file will be also uploaded to IPFS, setting the fileURI to the “newPolicyIPFSURL”.\n\n[Actual clearingMetaEvidence](https://ipfs.kleros.io/ipfs/QmaxkiRPYfHk4gY6Ydj1s18LtLokBHP5ahMKwH6thHwVEw/clearing.json)\n\n```\n{\n  \"category\": \"Curated List\",\n  \"title\": \"Proof of Humanity Clearing Request\",\n  \"description\": \"A request to remove the specified entry from a list of provable humans.\",\n  \"question\": \"Should the request to remove be accepted?\",\n  \"fileURI\": <newPolicyIPFSURI>,\n  \"evidenceDisplayInterfaceURI\": \"/ipfs/QmSL8d82dMhcThwERWaF4LtmCa4hgV7TyPjAo4fKCzPVkv/index.html\",\n  \"rulingOptions\": {\n    \"type\": \"single-select\",\n    \"titles\": [\n      \"Yes\",\n      \"No\"\n    ],\n    \"descriptions\": [\n      \"Accept the request to remove the entry.\",\n      \"Deny the request.\"\n    ]\n  }\n}\n```\n\nWe will obtain a new ipfs uri that we call “finalClearingMetaEvidenceURI”.\n\n### Governor Transaction\n\nWe will create the transaction in the kleros governor to call the changeMetaEvidence method of ProofOfHumanity contract. The parameters will be the named `finalRegistrationMetaEvidenceURI` and `finalClearingMetaEvidenceURI`.\n\n[![](https://gov.proofofhumanity.id/uploads/default/original/2X/e/ed7d5ce1c6d7c11b9e2d66510b42ef4f5634c5a7.png)](https://gov.proofofhumanity.id/uploads/default/original/2X/b/b258618395acbbbedd1279cea6fc989e16ec26e3.png)\n\n---\n### Resumen simple\nEste HIP actualizará y especificará en la Política la cuestión de la \"orientación\" con el texto de la política.\n\n### Resumen\nEl aumento de los desafíos que utilizan las imágenes reflejadas se ha convertido en el objetivo de los malos actores que explotan la política escrita. Existe la necesidad de actualizar la política para que este exploit sea eliminado.\n\n### Motivación\nLas imágenes reflejadas no son una causa válida para un reto de perfil, ya que tanto la visión humana como la computacional son capaces de distinguir perfectamente los rostros humanos cuando están reflejados (fuente: comprueba si te identificas cada mañana en el espejo del baño).\n\nComo mencionó @ArkaYana en un mensaje en Telegram, las razones para modificar la política son sencillas: \"Una imagen reflejada es una versión reflejada de una imagen original, mientras que una imagen rotada es una imagen que ha sido rotada alrededor de un punto específico. Estos términos se refieren a diferentes formas de transformar una imagen, y no son lo mismo. Una imagen reflejada no es necesariamente una imagen rotada, y viceversa\".\nLos expertos en matemáticas podrían argumentar que una imagen reflejada es una rotación sobre un plano tridimensional, pero eso va más allá de lo que especifica la política y no debería utilizarse como argumento contra los solicitantes de registro.\n\n### Especificación\n\n1. Una imagen de perfil que sea reflejo del vídeo correspondiente no es motivo de impugnación.\n2. Un vídeo reflejado cuando se elige la confirmación de la frase hablada no es motivo de impugnación.\n\n\n[HIP traducida utilizando DeepL](https://www.deepl.com/translator?utm_source=windows&utm_medium=app&utm_campaign=windows-share)\n",

      "content": "```\nHIP: 58\ntitle: Vouchallenger removals framework\nauthors: ludoviko.eth, herniadlf.eth\nstatus: Phase-3\ncreated: 2022-07-16\n```\n\n### [](https://gov.proofofhumanity.id/t/phase-2-hip-58-removal-of-vouchallengers/2625#simple-summary)Simple Summary\n\nThis HIP proposes a framework to allow to make removal requests under any of the already existing reasons for removal, in cases where an account is evidently vouching maliciously.\n\n### [](https://gov.proofofhumanity.id/t/phase-2-hip-58-removal-of-vouchallengers/2625#abstract)Abstract\n\nThe proposal will allow vouchallengers to be removed if they meet the vouchallenger definition in the body of this HIP. Vouchallengers will be removed and cannot re-register after a period. This will be enforced by a modification of the PoH policy. It will not be retroactive but the historical actions will be considered if there is a new vouchallenge.\n\n### [](https://gov.proofofhumanity.id/t/phase-2-hip-58-removal-of-vouchallengers/2625#motivation)Motivation\n\nVouching a profile is an act of responsibly giving the recognition of a legitimate and valid submission to the registry. Since the launch of Proof of Humanity, vouchallenging as in “the act of using the vouch feature of registered humans to make another profile vulnerable to challenge” has become a serious issue. As of the day that this HIP is being written, [57 profiles have more challenged vouched profiles than valid vouches](https://pastebin.com/8Gsj6LzQ), resulting in **211 challenges and a damage to the registrants totalling around 25 ETH**. and the number is growing. A [series](https://gov.proofofhumanity.id/t/suspicious-activity-change-to-pending-challenge-by-a-user-on-this-forum/623) [of](https://gov.proofofhumanity.id/t/penalizing-bad-vouchers/94) [governance](https://gov.proofofhumanity.id/t/correcting-submitions-before-vouching-phase-ends/404)[posts](https://gov.proofofhumanity.id/t/correcting-submitions-before-vouching-phase-ends/404) [raising the issue](https://gov.proofofhumanity.id/t/phase-1-hip-xx-allow-deposits-only-after-being-vouched/1205) and some solutions were proposed during this time. @[donosonaumczuk](https://gov.proofofhumanity.id/u/donosonaumczuk) has proposed a robust and good approach for L2 rollups and future upgrades to PoH’s smart contract, but in the meantime there are possible solutions that could make it harder (important! not impossible!) for malicious actors to continue this attack.\n\n### [](https://gov.proofofhumanity.id/t/phase-2-hip-58-removal-of-vouchallengers/2625#specification)Specification\n\n#### [](https://gov.proofofhumanity.id/t/phase-2-hip-58-removal-of-vouchallengers/2625#1-add-removal-criteria)1. Add removal criteria\n\nIn the latest PoH policy version, there are some explicit criteria to ask for a profile removal. A new removal criteria that allows a vouchallenger to be removed can be added. We can instruct jurors that in the case of a removal of a vouchallenger, if the alleged vouchallenger challenges this removal, to rule against the vouchallenger (effectively removing them from the registry).\n\n#### [](https://gov.proofofhumanity.id/t/phase-2-hip-58-removal-of-vouchallengers/2625#2-add-admission-criteria)2. Add admission criteria\n\nIn order to avoid the vouchallenge to re-register after a removal, another modification to the document will allow the cases where the removal was due to a vouchallenge to be inadmissible for a period. The text in the primary document will read:\n\n> - The submitter must respect the vouchallenger inadmissibility period, as defined in the Vouchallenger section of this policy.\n  \nThat `base_period` is 120 days (4 months). A vouchallenger that continues vouchallenging after a removal will be removed again folowing section **3 “Conditions to consider a vouchallenger as such”**. The next inadmissible periods will be calculated as `base_period*(times_removed)`. No matter the cause of the removal.\n\nParameters to consider: \n`base_period = 120 days`\n`times_removed`\n\n#### [](https://gov.proofofhumanity.id/t/phase-2-hip-58-removal-of-vouchallengers/2625#3-conditions-to-consider-a-vouchallenger-as-such)3. Conditions to consider a vouchallenger as such\n\nA **vouchallenge** is a vouch that results in a challenge. The **vouchallenger** is the profile that performs a vouchallenge, AND:\n- A profile that exceeds or equals the `max_vouchallenge_ratio`. The ratio is calculated as `vouches_wtih_incorrect_submissions / total_vouches`, AND \n- A profile that has vouched at least `initial_vouchallenge_threshold` that ended in any type of challenge, OR\n- A profile that after being already removed for being a vouchallenger, that makes at least `repeated_vouchallenge_threshold=1`, OR\n- A profile that was bribed to perform a single vouchallenge according to section 7.\n\nParameters to consider: \n`max_vouchallenge_ratio = 1/2`\n`initial_vouchallenge_threshold = 2`, \n`repeated_vouchallenge_threshold = 1`\n\n\n#### [](https://gov.proofofhumanity.id/t/phase-2-hip-58-removal-of-vouchallengers/2625#4-refuse-to-arbitrate-in-challenges-made-from-a-re-entrant-vouchallenger)4. “Refuse to arbitrate” in challenges made from a re-entrant vouchallenger\n\nIf a vouchallenger is removed and then re-registered in Proof of Humanity, every new vouchallenge must be voted as “Refuse to Arbitrate”.\n\n#### [](https://gov.proofofhumanity.id/t/phase-2-hip-58-removal-of-vouchallengers/2625#5-retroactivity)5. Retroactivity\n\nThis HIP is not retroactive to profiles that performed vouchallenges in the past that cross the initial_vouchallenge_threshold. However, if a previously active vouchallenger performs a new vouchallenge, and it is above the `repeated_vouchallenge_threshold` it will be considered a vouchallenger and will be removed.\n\n#### 6. Whitehat vouchallenge\n\nIn the case the deposit is returned to the challenged person from a vouchallenger that meets the criteria of section 3, that vouchallenge is not considered for the total count. The total deposit fund must be returned before the end of the evidence period of the removal request challenge. \n\n#### 7. Bribed vouchallenge\n\nIf there is proof (transaction records) that a vouchallenge is performed by a wallet/profile that received funds or tokens from another wallet/profile or a standalone wallet, the total amount of vouchallenges is added to both wallets. \n\nProof applies for wallets directly or indirectly connected to other wallets by funding/being funded in the last 6 months. \n\n\n#### Case examples\n* A recently registered profile that vouches its first profile that ends in challenge. \n\t* Not a vouchallenger since the minimum of vouchallenges is 2\n* A profile that has 24 vouchallenges but 340 total vouches\n\t* The ratio 24/340 is 0.07, so not a vouchallenger\n* A profile that has 2 vouchallenges and 4 total vouches\n\t* The ratio = 1/2, so it is a vouchallenger\n* A profile that was previously removed as a vouchallenger and after re-registering vouchallenges again\n\t* The profile is a vouchallenger\n* A person that attemps re registering the day after they get removed as a vouchallenger\n\t* The profile is challengeable and whoever challenges it gets the vouchallenger deposit.\n* A profile that has a ratio of 0.87 before the implementation of this hip, and then performs a challenge:\n\t* Clause 5 applies, profile is a vouchallenger\n* A profile that is being requested a removal, but returns the deposit to the address of the vouchallenged\n\t* Not a vouchallenger, and the vouchallenged is not added to total vouchallenges.\n* A profile that it is proven that he received funds from a wallet tied with transactions from a known or reported vouchallenger address (registered or not).\n\t* A vouchallenger, no matter the ratio.\n\n\n### [](https://gov.proofofhumanity.id/t/phase-2-hip-58-removal-of-vouchallengers/2625#rationale)Rationale\n\n-   More robust solutions than this one will come in the future, **but this solution tries to ammend the situation as of today,** which has brought a large impact to the registration process.\n-   The parameters are very strict to stop the abuse of these days. Such parameters could be changed in future HIPs.\n-   The vouch process need to be enhanced and be taken seriously.\n\n### [](https://gov.proofofhumanity.id/t/phase-2-hip-58-removal-of-vouchallengers/2625#implementation)Implementation\n\nFollowing what was specified in [HIP-45](https://gov.proofofhumanity.id/t/phase-3-hip-45-pdf-markdown/2232), the pull-request ([https://github.com/Proof-Of-Humanity/poh-docs/pull/4](https://github.com/Proof-Of-Humanity/poh-docs/pull/4)) was open for comments.

      "title": "[Phase 2][Signalling] HIP 28: Update submissionBaseDeposit",
      "content": "```\nHIP: 28\ntitle: Update submissionBaseDeposit\nauthors: William George, @greenlucid\nstatus: Phase 3\ncreated: 2021-08-24\nconflicts with: None\nlanguages: EN\n```\n\n## Simple Summary\n\nThis proposal would adjust the parameter that determines the part of submission deposits that is used to incentivize challengers.\n\n## Abstract\n\nUpdate the `submissionBaseDeposit`, which is currently **0.1 ETH**, to **0.055 ETH**.\n\n## Motivation\n\nSince the `submissionBaseDeposit` was set, there have been considerable fluctuations in ETH prices as well as in gas prices. These have had an effect on the incentivization of challengers. Also, as a result of the passage of [HIP-17](https://snapshot.org/#/poh.eth/proposal/Qmdc5SzL1Uxny2u5M2J933483ijnnpbxxsETioqAPSBPZn), challengers will only have to lock up enough ETH to cover the arbitration costs of one juror arbitration rather than three jurors reducing the risks that they have to be compensated to take on.\n\nThe value of **0.055 ETH** was generated by this [calculator](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1VR7_DM1cs1SVGiENwcACSh_vXs6mrwk8?usp=sharing), which was also used to generated these [proposed updates to the Kleros court parameters 1](https://forum.kleros.io/t/kip-49-parameter-updates-june-2022/755) that are being considered by the Kleros governance process in parallel. Note that the Kleros court parameter updates would have an effect on the arbitration cost part of PoH submission deposits; and given that the gas situation has changed again, after the proposal gets updated to reflect August gas prices, if both proposals pass the new total deposit would be around **0.055 + 0.015 = 0.07 ETH**.\n\nWith the current juror fees of **0.025 ETH**, which will remain until Kleros passes said proposal, the total deposit will remain around **0.055 + 0.025 = 0.08 ETH**.\n\nYou will note that the calculator attempts to make the `submissionBaseDeposit` satisfy two constraints:\n\n1.  There is a notion of the theoretical reward that is sufficient to adequately incentivize challengers in fiat terms. Then challengers should reliably receive this average reward after gas in a “normal” gas environment, which in this case the calculator conservatively takes to be up to 30 gwei. (Normally the theoretical reward would not signficantly change from one update to the next; however as a result of HIP-17 reducing the challenger deposit/ the risk the challenger must take on, I recalculated this. This essentially consisted of updating the value of J i.e. the total arbitration fees in the formulas in this [blog post](https://blog.kleros.io/the-challengers-dilemma-decentralized-law-enforcement/) and solving for C i.e. the challenge reward that retains the original level of security.)\n2.  A successful challenge should receive a large enough reward to cover the gas of challenging even in fairly severe gas conditions, which in this case the calculator takes to be up to 80 gwei.\n\nIn this case, it is actually the second constraint that is sharp. Namely, the requirement that the challenger reward should exceed gas costs even in fairly pessimistic gas assumptions prevents one from taking a lower value.\n\n## Specification\n\nThis would be done by using the `changeSubmissionBaseDeposit` function in the Proof of Humanity contract. This would be submitted as a transaction from the PoH Governor.\n\n## Implementation\n\nHave the PoH governor make the following call on the PoH contract:\n\n`changeSubmissionBaseDeposit(55000000000000000)`",

      "content": "```\nHIP: 78\ntitle: Clarify mirrored images during registration \nauthor: Ludoviko\nstatus: Phase 2\ncreated: 2023-01-09\n```\n\n### Simple Summary\n\nThis HIP will update and specify in the Policy the \"orientation\" issue with the policy text. \n\n### Abstract\n\nAn increase in challenges using the mirrored images has become the target of bad actors exploiting the written policy. There is a need to update the policy so that this exploit is removed.\n\n### Motivation\n\nMirrored images are not a valid cause for a profile challenge, since both human and computer vision are able to perfectly distinguish human faces when they are mirrored (source: check if you identify yourself every morning in the bathroom mirror). \n\nAs @ArkaYana mentioned in a message in Telegram, the reason for ammending the policy are straightforward: \"A mirrored image is a reflected version of an original image, while a rotated image is an image that has been rotated around a specific point. These terms refer to different ways of transforming an image, and they are not the same thing. A mirrored image is not necessarily a rotated image, and vice versa.\" \n\nMath-savvy people might argue that a mirrored image is a rotation over a three-dimensional plane, but that is beyond of what the policy is specifying and should not be used as an argument against registrants. \n\n### Specification\n\nFor inter-phase period 2 to 3, the exact specification will be layed out but the principles of the change in the policy text are the following:\n\n1. A profile picture that is mirrored from the corresponding video is not cause for a challenge. \n2. A mirrored video when the spoken phrase confirmation is chosen is not grounds for a challenge. \n\n\n### Rationale\n\n(Recommended for Phase 2)\n\n### Implementation\n\n(If necessary, recommended for Phase 3)\n\n---\n### Resumen simple\nEste HIP actualizará y especificará en la Política la cuestión de la \"orientación\" con el texto de la política.\n\n### Resumen\nEl aumento de los desafíos que utilizan las imágenes reflejadas se ha convertido en el objetivo de los malos actores que explotan la política escrita. Existe la necesidad de actualizar la política para que este exploit sea eliminado.\n\n### Motivación\nLas imágenes reflejadas no son una causa válida para un reto de perfil, ya que tanto la visión humana como la computacional son capaces de distinguir perfectamente los rostros humanos cuando están reflejados (fuente: comprueba si te identificas cada mañana en el espejo del baño).\n\nComo mencionó @ArkaYana en un mensaje en Telegram, las razones para modificar la política son sencillas: \"Una imagen reflejada es una versión reflejada de una imagen original, mientras que una imagen rotada es una imagen que ha sido rotada alrededor de un punto específico. Estos términos se refieren a diferentes formas de transformar una imagen, y no son lo mismo. Una imagen reflejada no es necesariamente una imagen rotada, y viceversa\".\nLos expertos en matemáticas podrían argumentar que una imagen reflejada es una rotación sobre un plano tridimensional, pero eso va más allá de lo que especifica la política y no debería utilizarse como argumento contra los solicitantes de registro.\n\n### Especificación\nPara el periodo entre fases 2 y 3, se establecerá la especificación exacta, pero los principios del cambio en el texto de la política son los siguientes:\n\n1. Una imagen de perfil que sea reflejo del vídeo correspondiente no es motivo de impugnación.\n2. Un vídeo reflejado cuando se elige la confirmación de la frase hablada no es motivo de impugnación.\n",

      "title": "HIP-76 [Phase 3]: Creation and election of new DAO Roles",
      "content": "```\nHIP: 76\nTitle: Creation and election of new DAO Roles\nAuthors: juanu.eth, AnM, Tomas Mika\nStatus: Phase 3\nCreated: 2022-11-23\n```\n\n## Simple Summary\n\nThis HIP aims at setting up the ground bases of how DAO Roles are created, and the reasoning behind their creation.\n\n## Abstract\n\nWe propose a way to define new Roles that will be democratically voted. These roles are to be covered by registered humans and should take care of administrative tasks in systems where decentralization and ownership are not possible. The community will vote for their trusted members to occupy those roles. Some examples are: Snapshot admins, multisig signers, group owners, etc.\n\n## Motivation\n\nDecentralization is not only given by technology. It can also be applied at tasks or responsibilities of one or more users.\n\nMany tasks on Proof of Humanity depend on limited centralized technologies on which changes or updates have to be done by one or multiple people. Until new technologies arrive, we need to distribute the power for those technologies, as much as possible.\n\nThe creation of multiple individual roles is a step forward on removing concentrated power over these technologies.\n\n## Specification\n\nEvery time the DAO detects the need for a new role to execute a centralized or semi-centralized task, a new HIP should be proposed to officialize the new role. \nIf the HIP passes phase 3, the process of election for those roles can be started by following the [HIP-39](https://gov.proofofhumanity.id/t/phase-3-hip-39-election-rules-for-elected-officials/1668) mechanism.\n\n### New roles\nWhich roles to elect will be figured out as the community grows and has different requirements, but the following definition gives an initial step forward.\n\n#### Definition of a Role\n\n- Any new role proposed MUST be purely administrative.\n- Its creation should come from the need of interacting with limited centralized technologies.\n- All actions to execute must be correctly consensuated following the current DAO voting mechanism. \n- None of the roles will be able to take any \"emergency decisions\"\n- A role will only be valid to be created, if there is a requirement to assign 1 or more users as that role, to interact with a technology that doesnt allow for decentralized ownership.\n\n\n#### New Role Proposals\n\nIn order to propose the creation, and further election, of a new role, a HIP must be created following the current DAO's voting mechanisms and specify the following:\n- Whats the need for the role?\n- What are the specific tasks that this role must take care of?\n- How many members must be elected for that role?\n- What knowledge is required for a human to be able to postulate for that role?\n- Roles are not hired employees. Roles are specific responsibilities assigned by the DAO to humans they trust, to interact with centralized or semi-centralized systems.\n\n\n#### Roles Limitations\nAll registered humans are entitled to propose themselves to be assigned a new role. Any human can only be assigned a single role at a time. This includes multiple multisig. In the event that the DAO owns more than one multisig, the same limitation applies and a human can't be assigned the multisig manager role for more than 1 multisigs at the same time.\n\n#### Roles duration\nAll roles will have a duration of 6 months. If a member decides to step down from their role, humans should postulate to fill that position.\n\nIf a user wants to stay for another 6 months, they can be reelected, as long as they propose themselves and be voted again for that position.\n\nAfter 6 months of being in charge of a role, a new election process can be started following HIP-39. Current role users will maintain their role until the full election process of new candidates has been completed. If no elections are created, roles will be mantained for an indeterminate time until a full election process is completed and new members have been elected.\n\nGiven this specification, it means that some users might occupy the role for more than 6 months. Time occupied on a role starts from the time a user was elected on a completed Phase 3 HIP (following HIP-39). \n\nThis means that if a user occupied the charge for 6 months, and then continued to be in charge of that role after those 6 months, and was re-elected, the new time for the role counts from when it was elected, without counting the extra months previously spent on that role.\n\n#### Removal of a Role assignment\nAll roles assigned to users must be 100% modifiable by the DAO at any time. Any role occupied by a user can, at any time, be questioned and the DAO can propose their removal through the process of a HIP, similar to those used to remove Mission Board members in the past, expressing the reasoning behind the removal.\n\n*(Traducción al español)*\n\n## Sumario Simple\n\nLa siguiente HIP busca establecer las bases sobre como son creados los nuevos Roles de la DAO, y su razonamiento detras de la creacion de ellos.\n\n## Abstracto\n\nCon esta HIP, proponemos un modo de definir nuevos roles votados democraticamente. Estos deben ser cubiertos por humanos registrados, y su responsabilidad es solamente la de llevar a cabo tareas administrativas en sistemas donde la centralizacion y propiedad de la DAO no son posibles.\nLa comunidad debera votar por los miembros en quienes confia para ocupar estos rtoles. Algunos ejemplos son: Administracion de Snapshot, Firmates de Multisig, dueños de grupos, etc.\n\n## Motivación\n\nLa decentralizacion no es solo un factor tecnologico. Puede ser aplicada a las tareas que realiza uno o mas usuarios.\n\nAlgunas tareas en Proof of Humanity dependen de tecnologias limitadas centralizadas en las que los cambios pueden ser hechos por una o mas personas con privilegios especificos. Necesitamos distirbuir el poder para esas tecnologias, tanto como podamos.\n\nLa creacion de multiples roles especificos es un paso hacia adelante en la remocion de poder concentrado sobre estas tecnologias.\n\n## Especificacion\n\nCada vez que la DAO detecte la necesidad de un rol para una tarea centralizada o semi-centralizada, se deberá crear una nueva HIP para oficializar el nuevo rol. Si la HIP pasa Phase 3, se podra proceder con el proceso de eleccion, siguiendo el marco de la [HIP-39](https://gov.proofofhumanity.id/t/phase-3-hip-39-election-rules-for-elected-officials/1668).\n\n### Nuevos roles\nLa creacion y posterior eleccion de roles será definida y descubierta por la comunidad a medida que sucedan requerimientos para cada una de ellas. La siguiente definicion es un primer paso para definir un Rol:\n\n#### Definicion de un Rol\n\n- Cualquier rol nuevo DEBE ser exclusivamente administrativo. \n- Debería surgir de la necesidad de interactuar con tecnologias limitadas centralizadas. \n- Todas las acciones a ejecutar deben ser previamente consensuadas utilizando los mecanismos de votacion actuales de la DAO. \n- Ninguno de los roles podrá tomar decisiones \"de emergencia\".\n- Un rol será válido para ser creado, si existe un requerimiento especifico de asignar a 1 o mas usuarios como, tal rol, para interactuar con una cuenta centralizada.\n- Los roles no son contrataciones. Son cargos especificos dados por la DAO a humanos en quienes se confia para interactuar con sistemas centralizados o semi centralizados.\n\n#### Propuesta de Nuevo Rol\n\nPara poder proponer la creacion de un nuevo rol, y su siguiente eleccion, debe crearse una HIP, que especifique lo siguiente:\n\n- Cual es la necesidad para crear el rol?\n- Cual(es) es/son sus tareas especificas?\n- Cuantos miembros deben ser elegidos para ese rol?\n- Cual es el conocimiento previo requerido para postularse al rol?\n\n### Limitaciones de los Roles\n\nTodos los humanos registrados tienen la posibilidad de proponerse a cualquiera de los roles, sin embargo, cada humano puede tener asignado solo un rol a la vez. Esto incluye ser Multisig manager de una sola multisig. En el evento de que la DAO sea dueña de mas de una multisig, la misma limitacion aplica, y un humano no podra ser asignado el rol de multisig manager para mas de una multisig, al mismo tiempo.\n\n#### Duracion de los Roles\nTodos los roles tendran una duracion maxima de 6 meses. Si un miembro decide dimitir de su rol, los usuarios interesados deberan postularse para ocupar esa posicion y ser llevado a votacion (usando HIP-39).\n\nSi un usuario desea mantener el rol, luego de cumplidos los 6 meses, debera postularse nuevamente y pasar por el proceso de votacion para esa posicion.\n\nLuego de transcurrirse los 6 meses a cargo de un rol, podrá iniciarse un nuevo proceso de eleccion siguiendo la HIP-39. Los usuarios con roles actuales mantendran su rol, hasta que el proceso de eleccion de nuevos candidatos haya sido completado. Si no se inicia el proceso de eleccion, pasados los 6 meses, los roles se mantendran en los usuarios actuales, por tiempo indeterminado, hasta que se lleve a cabo el proceso completo de eleccion de nuevos usuarios para esos roles.\n\nDe acuerdo a esta especificacion, significa que algunos usuarios podrian llegar a ocupar un rol por mas de 6 meses. El tiempo ocupado en un rol comienza a contar desde el momento en que el usuario fue electo en una HIP Fase 3 finalizada (siguiendo HIP-39). \n\nEsto significa que si un usuario ocupó el rol por 6 meses, y luego lo continuó estando a cargo de ese rol pasados los 6 meses, y luego fue re-electo, el nuevo tiempo del cargo cuenta a partir de la finalizacion de la eleccion, sin importar si estuvo mas de 6 meses anteriormente.\n\n#### Desafectacion de asignacion de Rol\nTodas las asignaciones de usuarios a roles deberian ser 100% modificables para la comunidad. Cualquier posicion ocupada por cualquier usuario, puede, en cualquier momento, ser puesta en duda y proponer su baja a traves de una HIP, similar a las ya utilizadas para eliminar a miembros del Mission Board, expresando la razon para su desafectacion.",

      "title": "HIP-76 [Phase 2] [Signaling] - Creation and election of new DAO Roles",
      "content": "# HIP-76: Creation and election of new DAO Roles\n```\nHIP: 76\nTitle: Creation and election of new DAO Roles\nAuthors: juanu.eth, AnM, Tomas Mika\nStatus: Phase 2\nCreated: 2022-11-05\n```\n\n## Simple Summary\n\nThis HIP aims at setting up the ground bases of how DAO Roles are created, and the reasoning behind their creation.\n\n## Abstract\n\nMission Board members are asumed to have control over multiple tasks such as: Snapshot Administrators, Multisig Signers, Group Owners, etc. With this HIP we propose a way to define new Roles, removing any of the administrative tasks assigned to mission boards and create individual roles for each task. This HIP also serves as a way of defining roles orphaned in case the Mission Board role ceases to exist.\n\n## Motivation\n\nDecentralization is not only given by technology. It can also be applied at tasks or responsibilities of one or more users.\n\nMany tasks on Proof of Humanity depend on limited centralized technologies on which changes or updates have to be done by one or multiple people. Until new technologies arrive, we need to distribute the power for those technologies, as much as possible.\n\nThe creation of multiple individual roles is a step forward on removing concentrated power over these technologies.\n\n## Specification\n\nEvery time the DAO detects the need for a new role to execute a centralized or semi-centralized task, a new HIP should be proposed to officialize the new role. \nIf the HIP passes phase 3, the process of election for those roles can be started by following the [HIP-39](https://gov.proofofhumanity.id/t/phase-3-hip-39-election-rules-for-elected-officials/1668) mechanism.\n\n### New roles\nWhich roles to elect will be figured out as the community grows and has different requirements, but the following definition gives an initial step forward.\n\n#### Definition of a Role\n\n- Any new role proposed MUST be purely administrative.\n- Its creation should come from the need of interacting with limited centralized technologies.\n- All actions to execute must be correctly consensuated following the current DAO voting mechanism. \n- None of the roles will be able to take any \"emergency decisions\"\n- A role will only be valid to be created, if there is a requirement to assign 1 or more users as that role, to interact with a technology that doesnt allow for decentralized ownership.\n\n\n#### New Role Proposals\n\nIn order to propose the creation, and further election, of a new role, a HIP must be created following the current DAO's voting mechanisms and specify the following:\n- Whats the need for the role?\n- What are the specific tasks that this role must take care of?\n- How many members must be elected for that role?\n- What knowledge is required for a human to be able to postulate for that role?\n- Roles are not hired employees. Roles are specific responsibilities assigned by the DAO to humans they trust, to interact with centralized or semi-centralized systems.\n\n\n#### Roles Limitations\nAll registered humans are entitled to propose themselves to be assigned a new role. Any human can only be assigned a single role at a time. This includes multiple multisig. In the event that the DAO owns more than one multisig, the same limitation applies and a human can't be assigned the multisig manager role for more than 1 multisigs at the same time.\n\n#### Roles duration\nAll roles will have a duration of 6 months. If a member decides to step down from their role, humans should postulate to fill that position.\nIf a user wants to stay for another 6 months, they can be reelected, as long as they propose themselves and be voted again for that position.\n\n#### Removal of a Role assignment\nAll roles assigned to users must be 100% modifiable by the DAO at any time. Any role occupied by a user can, at any time, be questioned and the DAO can propose their removal through the process of a HIP, similar to those used to remove Mission Board members, expressing the reasoning behind the removal.\n\n*(Traducción al español)*\n\n## Sumario Simple\n\nLa siguiente HIP busca establecer las bases sobre como son creados los nuevos Roles de la DAO, y su razonamiento detras de la creacion de ellos.\n\n## Abstracto\n\nSe asumia que miembros del Mission Board tenian control sobre multiples bienes como: Administracion de Snapshot, Firmates de Multisig, dueños de grupos, etc.\n\nCon esta HIP, proponemos un modo de definir nuevos roles, reemplazando las tareas que solian tenes los Mission Board, a roles especificos por persona. Esta HIP tambien sirve para definir roles huerfanos, en el caso de que la HIP-75, que elimina el rol de Mission Boards, sea aprobada.\n\n## Motivación\n\nLa decentralizacion no es solo un factor tecnologico. Puede ser aplicada a las tareas que realiza uno o mas usuarios.\n\nAlgunas tareas en Proof of Humanity dependen de tecnologias limitadas centralizadas en las que los cambios pueden ser hechos por una o mas personas con privilegios especificos. Necesitamos distirbuir el poder para esas tecnologias, tanto como podamos.\n\nLa creacion de multiples roles especificos es un paso hacia adelante en la remocion de poder concentrado sobre estas tecnologias.\n\n## Especificacion\n\nCada vez que la DAO detecte la necesidad de un rol para una tarea centralizada o semi-centralizada, se deberá crear una nueva HIP para oficializar el nuevo rol. Si la HIP pasa Phase 3, se podra proceder con el proceso de eleccion, siguiendo el marco de la [HIP-39](https://gov.proofofhumanity.id/t/phase-3-hip-39-election-rules-for-elected-officials/1668).\n\n### Nuevos roles\nLa creacion y posterior eleccion de roles será definida y descubierta por la comunidad a medida que sucedan requerimientos para cada una de ellas. La siguiente definicion es un primer paso para definir un Rol:\n\n#### Definicion de un Rol\n\n- Cualquier rol nuevo DEBE ser exclusivamente administrativo. \n- Debería surgir de la necesidad de interactuar con tecnologias limitadas centralizadas. \n- Todas las acciones a ejecutar deben ser previamente consensuadas utilizando los mecanismos de votacion actuales de la DAO. \n- Ninguno de los roles podrá tomar decisiones \"de emergencia\".\n- Un rol será válido para ser creado, si existe un requerimiento especifico de asignar a 1 o mas usuarios como, tal rol, para interactuar con una cuenta centralizada.\n- Los roles no son contrataciones. Son cargos especificos dados por la DAO a humanos en quienes se confia para interactuar con sistemas centralizados o semi centralizados.\n\n#### Propuesta de Nuevo Rol\n\nPara poder proponer la creacion de un nuevo rol, y su siguiente eleccion, debe crearse una HIP, que especifique lo siguiente:\n\n- Cual es la necesidad para crear el rol?\n- Cual(es) es/son sus tareas especificas?\n- Cuantos miembros deben ser elegidos para ese rol?\n- Cual es el conocimiento previo requerido para postularse al rol?\n\n### Limitaciones de los Roles\n\nTodos los humanos registrados tienen la posibilidad de proponerse a cualquiera de los roles, sin embargo, cada humano puede tener asignado solo un rol a la vez. Esto incluye ser Multisig manager de una sola multisig. En el evento de que la DAO sea dueña de mas de una multisig, la misma limitacion aplica, y un humano no podra ser asignado el rol de multisig manager para mas de una multisig, al mismo tiempo.\n\n#### Duracion de los Roles\nTodos los roles tendran una duracion maxima de 6 meses. Si un miembro decide dimitir de su rol, los usuarios interesados deberan postularse para ocupar esa posicion y ser llevado a votacion (usando HIP-39).\n\nSi un usuario desea mantener el rol, luego de cumplidos los 6 meses, debera postularse nuevamente y pasar por el proceso de votacion para esa posicion.\n\n#### Desafectacion de asignacion de Rol\nTodas las asignaciones de usuarios a roles deberian ser 100% modificables para la comunidad. Cualquier posicion ocupada por cualquier usuario, puede, en cualquier momento, ser puesta en duda y proponer su baja a traves de una HIP, similar a las ya utilizadas para eliminar a miembros del Mission Board, expresando la razon para su desafectacion.",

All tasks that are assigned to the Mission Board Members will cease to be their responsibility. The current Mission Board Members Board Santi.eth, 0xjean.eth, nix.eth (Justin Kalland) and V4len.eth, as well as the currently vacant fifth seat will cease to function due to the elimination of the position they held.\n\n## Motivation\n\nThe role of Mission Board Member has so far only caused a rift in the community, delaying the normal development of the organization. Several of its members embarrassed the community with their public manifestations, others were not present except on rare occasions. Most of the functions assigned to them have not been executed. “Personalisms” only proved to generate a war of egos that discredits us in front of the rest of the ecosystem.\n\n## Specification\n\nThe Mission Board will cease to be a representative figure of this DAO. The functions of its members will cease to be its responsibility.\n\n## Implementation\n\nUpon approval of phase 3 of this proposal, the role of the Mission Board will be eliminated and its members will cease to be recognized and representative figures for Proof of Humanity.\nThe responsibilities that are currently assigned to them will be decided democratically through the Snapshot platform.\n\n---\n*(Traducción al español)*\n\n## Sumario Simple\n\nEsta HIP pretende remover la figura de Mission Board Member tal como existe en la actualidad y dar el cese de funciones a los actuales miembros de la junta de misión.\n\n## Abstracto\n\nSe dará cese al rol de Mission Board Member. Todas las tareas que estén adjudicadas a los miembros de la junta de misión dejarán de ser su responsabilidad. Los actuales miembros de la Junta de Misión Board Santi.eth, 0xjean.eth, nix.eth (Justin Kalland) y V4len.eth, además del quinto asiento actualmente vacante cesarán en sus funciones debido a la eliminación del puesto que ostentaban.\n\n## Motivación\n\nEl rol de Mission Board Member, hasta el momento, solo provocó una grieta en la comunidad, retrasando el normal desarrollo de la organización. Varios de sus miembros avergonzaron a esta comunidad con sus manifestaciones públicas, otros no estuvieron presentes, salvo en contadas ocasiones. La mayoría de las funciones que les fueron asignadas no se han ejecutado. Los personalismos solo demostraron generar una guerra de egos que nos desprestigia ante el resto del ecosistema.\n\n## Especificación\n\nLa junta de Misión dejará de ser una figura representativa de esta DAO. Las funciones de sus miembros dejarán de ser su responsabilidad.\n\n## Implementación\n\nAl momento de aprobarse la fase 3 de esta propuesta, se eliminará el rol de Junta de Misión y sus miembros dejarán de ser figuras reconocidas y representativas para Proof of Humanity.\nLas responsabilidades que hasta el momento se les adjudicaron serán dirimidas de manera democrática a través de la plataforma snapshot.",

      "title": "[Phase 3][Binding] HIP-74: A Peaceful Fork",
      "content": "```\nHIP: 74\nTitle: A Peaceful Fork 🕊\nAuthors: clesaege.eth & santi.eth & Andrei\nStatus: Phase 3\nCreated: 2022-09-12\n```\n\n## Simple Summary\n\nThis HIP sets the route to do a peaceful fork on the Proof of Humanity DAO and the protocol itself. The forks will be named:\n\n* Open Proof of Humanity (Open-PoH): Developed and maintained by independent developers from the Proof of Humanity DAO and UBI.\n* Proof of Humanity Origin (PoH-Origin): Developed and maintained by developers from the Proof of Humanity DAO and Cooperative Kleros as the original developers of the protocol.\n\nThis way the communities of Open-PoH and PoH-Origin respectively can part their ways amicably, each working on their own vision of how the protocol should evolve.\n\n## Abstract\n\nThe Proof of Humanity DAO consists of multiple resources that constitute its organization, governance methods, treasury and the protocol itself.\n\nAs the project prepares for the launch of [Proof of Humanity v2](https://github.com/AndreiMVP/ProofOfHumanityV2) (PoHv2) in order to reduce costs and help onboard more users, this is also an opportunity for the community to fork the protocol and engage each side of the DAO to support their preferred version of the project.\n\nIn that regard, rather than having only one deployment of PoHv2, we will instead have two versions of the protocol each running on their own chains of preference moving forward while still recognizing as valid the list of humans verified before the fork on Proof of Humanity v1.\n\nSince the community already began the development of some of the resources required for each side of the fork, we recommend to use those existing resources already created and if possible simply clarify to which side they belong.\n\n## Specification\n\nThe resources corresponding to v1 of Proof of Humanity will remain connected to that smart contract and project. These consist of the following list of resources and will not be modified in any way for the purposes of the fork.\n\n|Feature|Legacy Proof of Humanity|\n| --- | --- |\n|Protocol|[Mainnet](https://etherscan.io/address/0xc5e9ddebb09cd64dfacab4011a0d5cedaf7c9bdb)|\n|Governor|[0x327…CfdF](https://etherscan.io/address/0x327a29fcE0a6490E4236240Be176dAA282EcCfdF#code)|\n|Snapshot|Require approval of both forks|\n|Treasury|[0x327…CfdF](https://etherscan.io/address/0x327a29fcE0a6490E4236240Be176dAA282EcCfdF#code) & [MultiSig](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmfRD4GuqZobNi2NT2C77a3UTQ452ffwstr4fjEJixUgjf/#/wallet/0x99126D641ba3924C8AF4dcA4e3B2C33a41718913)|\n|Arbitrator|Requests frozen|\n\nMoving forward, two deployments of PoH v2 will be executed that will have backwards compatibility with the list of humans available on PoH v1.\n\nEach side on PoH v2 will be able to make decisions without impacting the votes on the other fork respectively. The users verified on these new PoH v2 will have voting rights over the Snapshot page corresponding to each fork.\n\nThe forks will consist of the following resources:\n\n|Resource|PoH-Origin (Kleros Coop)|Open-PoH (UBI 💧)|Status|\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|Landing|[proofofhumanity.id](https://proofofhumanity.id/)|[ubi.eth.limo](https://ubi.eth.limo/)|✅|\n|PoH v2|🚨 Pending (multiplatform starting with Ethereum and Gnosis)|🚨 Pending (on Polygon)|👷‍♀️ *|\n|User Interface|[app.proofofhumanity.id](https://app.proofofhumanity.id/)|[proofofhumanity.org](https://proofofhumanity.org/)|✅|\n|Governor v2|🚨 Pending|🚨 Pending|👷‍|\n|Snapshot v2|🚨 Pending|🚨 Pending|👷‍|\n|Treasury v2|Same as Governor v2|Same as Governor v2|✅|\n|Forum|[gov.proofofhumanity.id](https://gov.proofofhumanity.id/)|[ubidao.social](https://ubidao.social/)|✅|\n|Twitter|[@proofofhumanity](https://twitter.com/proofofhumaniy)|[@pohdao](https://twitter.com/pohdao)|✅|\n|Telegram|[t.me/proofhumanity](https://t.me/proofhumanity)|[t.me/proofofhumanityDAOen](https://t.me/proofofhumanityDAOen)|✅|\n|Github|[Proof-Of-Humanity](https://github.com/Proof-Of-Humanity)|[OpenProofOfHumanity](https://github.com/OpenProofOfHumanity)|✅|\n\n##### * 👷‍ Being Built.\n\nEach side will focus on building a PoH ecosystem on a leading side-chain or Layer 2 rollup in order to complement the efforts of each other when it comes to onboarding new users.\n\n## Inheritance\n\nEach fork will inherit the laws and approved proposals from the decisions voted on the [Snapshot of v1](https://snapshot.org/#/poh.eth). From the date of the fork onwards, their legal bodies will drift apart.\n\nEach side is free to make and approve a constitution or a new legal body of which it would apply strictly to their fork. A constitution or new set of HIPs may override the impact of legacy HIPs on each fork but won’t modify the status quo of legislation on legacy PoH v1.\n\nIf this proposal is accepted, a transpartisan proposal to approve the constitutions will need to take place. It will consist of a unique snapshot vote where humans will be able to approve or reject only one constitution (so that one side cannot reject the constitution of the other). The fork will happen if both constitutions receive more approvals than rejections.\n\nThe funds held on the Governor and Gitcoin Multisig of PoH v1 will be split in half and allocated on each new Governor contract that will be used by each fork implementing PoH v2. Liabilities such as grant payment will also be split in half between both forks.\n\nThe funds currently available on the Gitcoin Multisig will be sent to the [Governor on 0x327…CfdF](https://etherscan.io/address/0x327a29fcE0a6490E4236240Be176dAA282EcCfdF#code) before the fork happens in order to reduce the quantity of required transactions.\n\n## Implementation\n\nKleros will assist with the deployment of all the corresponding Proof of Humanity v2 smart contracts on each chain providing they don’t require any changes and the developers will be responsible for setting up all of the infrastructure that is necessary to interact with their side of fork.\n\nAll of the assets remaining on the [Gitcoin Multisig](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmfRD4GuqZobNi2NT2C77a3UTQ452ffwstr4fjEJixUgjf/#/wallet/0x99126D641ba3924C8AF4dcA4e3B2C33a41718913) will be transferred to the Governor of v1 available on [0x327…CfdF](https://etherscan.io/address/0x327a29fcE0a6490E4236240Be176dAA282EcCfdF#code) before sending funds to each fork.\n\nEach fork will implement a Kleros Governor contract for their v2 on Mainnet. Each Governor will receive 50% of the funds coming from the Governor of v1 on [0x327…CfdF](https://etherscan.io/address/0x327a29fcE0a6490E4236240Be176dAA282EcCfdF#code).\n\nThe new Governors for each v2 will be configured with the same parameters and settings currently set on the Governor of v1 but they will receive MetaEvidence that will connect each Governor of v2 to their respective Snapshot page.\n\nThe Snapshot pages of each fork will allow voting from humans that are considered registered from their side of the fork. It’s up to each fork to decide if they will consider the humans from v1 or the other fork.\n\nOn the main contract side, for mainnet, the v1 registrations requests will be frozen. Removals would be frozen too to solve the case of disagreement between forks about a removal of the profile (say one fork desires removal for a profile in the registry because of a different interpretation of sybil), at the expense of UX (in case user wants to deregister from both PoH). Freezing of both registration and removal requests is possible by making the arbitration fee an unpayable amount (by making the number of jurors the maximum number).\n\nTo facilitate a removal on a particular fork, either because of a request or bad vouching, the corresponding profile data must have been copied to the storage of that particular fork’s v2 contract (at the start of interaction with the profile) and somehow marked as removed.\n\nThis functionality has not been implemented yet as the current v2 contract does not copy storage of v1 contract (it only checks its data when needed). On agreement, the feature will be implemented. 👷‍\n\nOnce the fork is initiated, the v1 contract will be frozen and the v2 contracts of each fork need to be deployed with the corresponding parameters set (including the common address of v1 contract). There might be profiles that are in the pending state at the moment of fork (so it might take some days after the fork event for them to have a resolved state - None/Registered). The process of registration of these profiles should be finalized based on the old rules. Profiles in vouching state at the moment of fork will have to withdraw. At this point, the fork is agreed at the contract level.\n\nLet there be peace and BUIDL 💪",

All tasks that are assigned to the Mission Board Members will cease to be their responsibility. The current Mission Board Members Board Santi.eth, 0xjean.eth, nix.eth (Justin Kalland) and V4len.eth, as well as the currently vacant fifth seat will cease to function due to the elimination of the position they held.\n\n## Motivation\n\nThe role of Mission Board Member has so far only caused a rift in the community, delaying the normal development of the organization. Several of its members embarrassed the community with their public manifestations, others were not present except on rare occasions. Most of the functions assigned to them have not been executed. “Personalisms” only proved to generate a war of egos that discredits us in front of the rest of the ecosystem.\n\n## Specification\n\nThe Mission Board will cease to be a representative figure of this DAO. The functions of its members will cease to be its responsibility.\n\n## Rationale\n\nOngoing developments proved that the MB produces enormous political cost, for dubious benefit. Moreover, HIPs have proven to be a way to remove MB members, despite being democratically elected.\n\nThe only practical purpose of the MB is being able to correct small mistakes, under specific circumstances, anything else requiring HIP amendments. This benefit doesn’t warrant the cost.\n\n## Implementation\n\nUpon approval of phase 3 of this proposal, the role of the Mission Board will be eliminated and its members will cease to be recognized and representative figures for Proof of Humanity.\nThe responsibilities that are currently assigned to them will be decided democratically through the Snapshot platform.\n\n*(Traducción al español)*\n\n## Simple Summary\n\nEsta HIP pretende remover la figura de Mission Board Member tal como existe en la actualidad y dar el cese de funciones a los actuales miembros de la junta de misión.\n\n## Abstract\n\nSe dará cese al rol de Mission Board Member. Todas las tareas que estén adjudicadas a los miembros de la junta de misión dejarán de ser su responsabilidad. Los actuales miembros de la Junta de Misión Board Santi.eth, 0xjean.eth, nix.eth (Justin Kalland) y V4len.eth, además del quinto asiento actualmente vacante cesarán en sus funciones debido a la eliminación del puesto que ostentaban.\n\n## Motivation\n\nEl rol de Mission Board Member hasta el momento solo provocó una grieta en la comunidad, retrasando el normal desarrollo de la organización. Varios de sus miembros avergonzaron a esta comunidad con sus manifestaciones publicas, otros no estuvieron presentes salvo en contadas ocasiones. La mayoria de las funciones que les fueron asignadas no se han ejecutado. Los personalismos solo demostraron generar una guerra de egos que nos desprestigia ante el resto del ecosistema.\n\n## Specification\n\nLa junta de Misión dejará de ser una figura representativa de esta DAO. Las funciones de sus miembros dejaran de ser su responsabilidad.\n\n## Rationale\n\nLos acontecimientos en curso han demostrado que el MB produce un enorme coste político, a cambio de un dudoso beneficio. Además, los HIP han demostrado ser una forma de destituir a los miembros del MB, a pesar de haber sido elegidos democráticamente.\n\nEl único propósito práctico del MB es poder corregir pequeños errores, en circunstancias específicas, cualquier otra cosa que requiera enmiendas del HIP. Este beneficio no justifica el coste.\n\n## Implementation\n\nAl momento de aprobarse la fase 3 de esta propuesta se eliminará el rol de Junta de Misión y sus miembros dejarán de ser figuras reconocidas y representativas para Proof of Humanity.\nLas responsabilidades que hasta el momento se les adjudican seran dirimidas de manera democratica a través de la plataforma snapshot.",

      "title": "[Phase 3] HIP-72: Removal of Clement Lesaege as mission board member",
      "content": "```\nHIP: 73\nTitle: Removal of Clement Lesaege as mission board member\nAuthor: ludoviko.eth, v4len.eth, vice, lauraleticialopez.eth (Lety), pablo, drlorente97.eth\nStatus: Phase 2\nCreated: 2022-01-06\nUpdated: 2022-10-15\n```\n\n# Simple Summary\n\nThis HIP proposes the removal of Clement Leseage from the mission board and the snapshot administration.\n\n# Abstract\n\nThe event on EF Devcon VI where Clément produced an incident involving a violent and unsustained reaction towards Santi Siri as a speaker, has sparked debates about the fitness of Clement as a Member of the Mission Board. Based on this and previous events regarding the actions of Clement as an admin for the Snapshot polls, and the overall attitude of constantly delaying any advancement or progress of any proposals that obstructs his own agenda, the authors of this proposal are proposing:\n\n- The destitution of Clement Lesaege as a Mission Board Member, based on the premise that, in our opinion, he is not aligned with the values of Democratization and Decentralization and respect for privacy of individuals being registered in the DAO.\n\n# Motivation\n\nHere is a rundown of events that accumulated since the inception of the proposal:\n\n- Not acknowledging the issues regarding the concentration and dominance of a priviledged few in the Kleros Humanity Court and not doing anything to prevent such an abnormal degree of centralization.\n- Over-reaching MBM authority by numerous attempts (some successful) to demote, and then censor moderators from Telegram groups. An abuse of the mechanisms of those channels to supress dissent (36 warn actions in three days after a violent takeover of the now Kleros’ PoH group). The warns and the bans in the Kleros PoH group even included other Mission Board Members since then.\n- Disregarding serious security threats to the registering process ([metadata issue 1](https://github.com/Proof-Of-Humanity/proof-of-humanity-web/issues/295#event-4798667830)): When warned about this issue, Clement lowered the priority of a huge security threat in which personal georeferencing data was being leaked into the registry profiles. The best answer he could give about the priority demotion he replied [“Because it’s a nice to have, not a bug or a core feature.” 1](https://t.me/proofhumanity/28352). This was the response of people having their ethereum wallets and their physical addresses exposed in the blockchain virtually forever. The issue is still unsolved in the Kleros front-end.\n- Gerrymandering attempts by creating a set of 438 ethereum wallets that automatically delegated to him, even that up to this day, les than one third is registered or even an active member of the PoH community. The alleged “Myanmar” community is as of this day, completely invisible and without any signs of these people having the full picture of how the DAO works or if they had any alternatives to delegate to other candidates.\n- Systematically obstaculizing any process that helps humans register (352, vouchallengers, etc) sometimes suggesting that challenges are good and vouch-and-challenge attacks are part of the normal mechanism:\n  - Example 1, stating that [the only way to keep deposits low is keeping the challenges high](https://gov.proofofhumanity.id/t/challenges-and-removals-its-always-fair/251/10) **making Proof of Humanity a dispute-creating machine at expenses of unaware and unprepared humans**.\n  - Example 2, falsely accusing of being “undemocratic” a democratic poll [Hiring] Product Manager - #68 by clesaege 1 and this is critical for someone holding veto power in snapshot.\n  - Example 3, saying that having the opportunity to withdraw from a mistake where an innocent person is attacked by a vouchallenger is [“perfectly fine”](https://gov.proofofhumanity.id/t/phase-1-hip-12-let-users-decide-to-accept-vouches-when-your-profile-is-in-vouching-phase/583/5) and that giving enough time for a person to correct a mistake [“courtesy” and not a right](https://gov.proofofhumanity.id/t/phase-1-hip-12-let-users-decide-to-accept-vouches-when-your-profile-is-in-vouching-phase/583/7).\n- Sabotaging or lack of respect to proper procedure:\n  - Stalling the hiring process to the point that [the actual hiring was put in hibernation](https://gov.proofofhumanity.id/t/hiring-product-manager/299/68). It is also worth noting the contradiction with other comments in which he stated that hiring [should be done fast](https://gov.proofofhumanity.id/t/hiring-developer/300/5).\n  - Double standards: [Arguing about voter fatigue in proposals that he disagreed with](https://gov.proofofhumanity.id/search?q=voter%20fatigue%20%40clesaege), [creating voter fatigue himself by cloning a proposal already being voted](https://gov.proofofhumanity.id/t/phase-2-hip-18-communication-roles/816) in order to match his own individual standards.\n  - Under-specifying regulations (proposals about hiring, about creation of proposals) so that can be later interpreted as he unilaterally thinks.\n- Lack of proper spirit of collaboration with the community, showing lack of flexibility when community wanted questions answered.\n- Taking decisions in the background without proper consultation to DAO members, or disregarding alternative perspectives.\n- The removal of administrative rigths over the Snapshot platform.\n\n# Rationale\n\n**Clément was, is, and will still be a key and most valuable collaborator in terms of technical skills.** The accumulation of this and other events suggests that Clement is unfit to represent the DAO. This does not mean that he is unable to continue contributing in some other way, and this is not a lack of recognition that he created the protocol.\n\nThis is the third time this HIP is refloated. Originally the HIP was left on hold since its creation, but events at that time regarding removal of dissenting members of the DAO from telegram channels have sparked the interest of the community to move forward with this proposal.\n\n# Implementation\n\nIf Phase 3 binding vote is approved, the position that Clement Lesaege is occupying as a Mission Board Member will become vacant. Mr. Lesaege will not be able to be candidate for the Mission Board Member position (or any derivatives/equivalents from this institution, i.e., positions with executive functions) for the following 2 years starting from the Phase 3 voting.  \nIn addition to this, Mr. Lesaege’s administrative rigths to the snapshot platform will be removed indefinitely",

      "title": "[Signalling][Phase-2] HIP-58 - Removal of vouchallengers",
      "content": "```\nHIP: 58\ntitle: Removal of vouchallengers\nauthors: ludoviko.eth, herniadlf.eth\nstatus: Phase-2\ncreated: 2022-07-16\n```\n\n### Simple Summary\nThis HIP proposes a framework to allow to make removal requests under any of the already existing reasons for removal, in cases where an account is evidently vouching maliciously.\n\n### Abstract\nThe proposal will allow vouchallengers to be removed if they meet the vouchallenger definition in the body of this HIP. Vouchallengers will be removed and cannot re-register after a period. This will be enforced by a modification of the PoH policy. It will not be retroactive but the historical actions will be considered if there is a new vouchallenge.\n\n### Motivation\n\nVouching a profile is an act of responsibly giving the recognition of a legitimate and valid submission to the registry. Since the launch of Proof of Humanity, vouchallenging as in \"the act of using the vouch feature of registered humans to make another profile vulnerable to challenge\" has become a serious issue. As of the day that this HIP is being written, [57 profiles have more challenged vouched profiles than valid vouches](https://pastebin.com/8Gsj6LzQ), resulting in **211 challenges and a damage to the registrants totalling around 25 ETH**. and the number is growing. A [series](https://gov.proofofhumanity.id/t/suspicious-activity-change-to-pending-challenge-by-a-user-on-this-forum/623) [of](https://gov.proofofhumanity.id/t/penalizing-bad-vouchers/94) [governance](https://gov.proofofhumanity.id/t/correcting-submitions-before-vouching-phase-ends/404)[posts](https://gov.proofofhumanity.id/t/correcting-submitions-before-vouching-phase-ends/404) [raising the issue](https://gov.proofofhumanity.id/t/phase-1-hip-xx-allow-deposits-only-after-being-vouched/1205) and some solutions were proposed during this time. @[donosonaumczuk](https://gov.proofofhumanity.id/u/donosonaumczuk) has proposed a robust and good approach for L2 rollups and future upgrades to PoH's smart contract, but in the meantime there are possible solutions that could make it harder (important! not impossible!) for malicious actors to continue this attack. \n\n### Specification\n**1. Add removal criteria**\nIn the latest PoH policy version, there are some explicit criteria to ask for a profile removal. A new removal criteria that allows a vouchallenger to be removed can be added. We can instruct jurors that in the case of a removal of a vouchallenger, if the alleged vouchallenger challenges this removal, to rule against the vouchallenger (effectively removing them from the registry). \n\n**2. Add admission criteria**\nIn order to avoid the vouchallenge to re-register after a removal, another modification to the document will allow the cases where the removal was due to a vouchallenge to be inadmissible for a period. That base period is 120 days (4 months). A vouchallenger that continue vouchallenging after a removal will be removed again folowing **3. Conditions to consider a vouchallenger as such**. The next inadmissible periods will be calculated as `base_period*(times_removed)`. No matter the cause of the removal.\n\nParameters to consider: `base_period`\n\n**3. Conditions to consider a vouchallenger as such**\n- A profile that has vouched 2 (two) submissions that ended with 'Incorrect Submission' removal.\n- A profile that make a single (1) vouch for a submission that ends with 'Incorrect Submission' removal, after being already removed previously for being a vouchallenger.\n\nParameters to consider: `initial_vouchallenge_threshold=2`, `repeated_vouchallenge_threshold=1`\n\n**4. \"Refuse to arbitrate\" in challenges made from a re-entrant vouchallenger**\n\nIf a vouchallenger is removed and then re-registered in Proof of Humanity, every new vouchallenge must be voted as \"Refuse to Arbitrate\". \n\n**5. Retroactivity**\nThis HIP is not retroactive to profiles that performed vouchallenged in the past that cross the initial_vouchallenge_threshold. However, if a previously active vouchallenger performs a new vouch for a profile that ends with 'Incorrect Submission' removal, it will be consider a vouchallenger and will be removed.\n\n### Rationale\n* More robust solutions than this one will come in the future, but this solution tries to ammend the situation as of today, which has brought a large impact to the registration process. \n* The parameters are very strict to stop the abuse of these days. Such parameters could be changed in future HIPs. \n* The vouch process need to be enhanced and be taken seriously.\n\n\n### Implementation\n\n...More details in Phase 3... Basically, write clearly these changes in the policy. Make a PR and update the evidence in the Governor.\n",

The proposal is to remove the MBM Justin Kalland, which allow the DAO to call a new Election. \n\n### Motivation\n\nJustin Kalland has done a great work advocating for the DAO. Unfortunately, he was unreachable for a long time over his social media accounts and personal messengers. This brings some critical decisions of the Mission Board to the risk of being stalled due to a tie. For example as of today, the interim rules of the Spanish Kleros-backed Group states that \"a tie is sufficient to remove a mod\" which is not an ideal situation given the current conformation of the Board. \n\n\n### Specification\n\nRemoval of Justin Kalland as a mission board member. \n\n### Rationale\nNo significant activity since January 2022. \n\n### Implementation\n\n(If necessary, recommended for Phase 3)",

      "content": "```\nHIP: 72\ntitle: Grant to fund a PoH airdrop solution\nauthor: green\nstatus: Phase-3\ncreated: 2022-06-29\nconflicts with: None\nlanguages: EN\n```\n\n## Simple summary\n\nLaunch a grant to build an app to ease the process of airdropping to humans registered in PoH.\n\n## Abstract\n\nAirdrops are the currently most used feature of PoH and it would be in the general interest of the DAO to provide an easy way for philanthropists to airdrop tokens to its humans. This HIP sets up a grant to incentivize building such a tool.\n\n## Motivation\n\nOn making [KIP-51 ](https://forum.kleros.io/t/kip-51-pnk-airdrop-to-poh-users/771), we came to realization that there is no such thing as a tool to airdrop to humans registered in PoH. Since the most interested party in the existence of such a tool is PoH DAO, and not Kleros DAO, it makes sense for PoH DAO to be the one that spends the resources needed for it to exist.\n\nOther DAOs that are interested in performing sybil resistant airdrops could use it as an easy default allocation. Then, in the future we might see projects such as Optimism liberally drop tokens to PoH.\n\n## Specification\n\nUpon completion of the PoH airdrop tool, send 3 ETH from the PoH treasury to the grantee, [forer.eth](https://etherscan.io/address/0x89c4ACb8B5b5B8E5B2121934B9e143569a914C80). If PoH treasury does not contain enough funds but they are deposited in vaults generating yield (such as the [UBI Burner ](https://app.democracy.earth/#/)), then this amount will be withdrawn from the vaults and then sent to forer.eth.\n\nThe tool will work in the following way:\n\n### Contract\n\n* Anyone can create an airdrop. They pass a token, an amount for the whole airdrop, the merkle root, a JSON file uploaded to ipfs with info to allow for redemptions.\n\n### Subgraph\n\n* Keeps track of airdrops and redemptions. Allows fetching information quickly from the frontend.\n\n### Frontend\n\n* If the user connects with a wallet with pending airdrops, they’ll be notified and will be able to trigger the transactions needed to withdraw them.\n* It provides a way for donors to create an airdrop to humans easily. Donors can create airdrops just by going through a form, and sending ERC20 tokens to the contract. The frontend will then fetch all eligible recipients, create a merkle tree, upload it to IPFS and then finally create the airdrop in the contract.\n\n### Completion\n\n*Completion* (the criteria for delivering the grant) is defined as:\n\n* supporting these features described above.\n* open source project.\n* deploying it publicly, at the latest, 60 days after this HIP is accepted.\n* accessible through a frontend, that will be accessible through a domain. (either web2 or ENS are fine).\n* will require *low, or no maintenance* in regards to the features described above.\n* contains, in the frontend, a mention of proof of humanity that reads “Commissioned by Proof of Humanity”.\n\n## Rationale\n\n### Why is there no maintenance requirement?\n\nOriginally, maintenance was part of the grant, and the bill of costs was greater. But there were a few edge cases around it:\n\n* If everything is delivered at once upon completion, you’re trusting on the grantee to deliver on the maintenance.\n* If the grant is delivered after the maintenance period, then the grantee will probably be less interested.\n\nAlso, the grant amount would also had been higher. So, instead, the project will just be built with low or no-maintenance requirements.\n\n### Why not support NFTs\n\nIt would increase the complexity severely to handle both ERC20 and NFT in the same tool. Merkle airdrop tools benefit from fungibility. To reduce the time needed to ship the tool, reducing features was chosen as the approach.\n\n### Why self-select as grantee\n\nSince I made the proposal in June 29 (3 months ago), no one offered to take the grant. So, to avoid the proposal from getting stale, I advanced it to Phase 2 through selecting myself.\n\n### Why 3 ETH\n\nIt was approximated through the following bill of costs:\n\n* 0.5 ETH: ideation, design of the tool and stack.\n* 1 ETH: smart contract\n* 0.5 ETH: subgraph\n* 1 ETH: frontend",

      "title": "[Phase-2] HIP-58 - Removal of vouchallengers",
      "content": "```\nHIP: 57\ntitle: Vouchallenger removals framework\nauthors: ludoviko.eth, herniadlf.eth\nstatus: Phase-1\ncreated: 2022-07-16\n```\n\n### Simple Summary\nThis HIP proposes a framework to allow to make removal requests under any of the already existing reasons for removal, in cases where an account is evidently vouching maliciously.\n\n### Abstract\nThe proposal will allow vouchallengers to be removed if they meet the vouchallenger definition in the body of this HIP. Vouchallengers will be removed and cannot re-register after a period. This will be enforced by a modification of the PoH policy. It will not be retroactive but the historical actions will be considered if there is a new vouchallenge.\n\n### Motivation\n\nVouching a profile is an act of responsibly giving the recognition of a legitimate and valid submission to the registry. Since the launch of Proof of Humanity, vouchallenging as in \"the act of using the vouch feature of registered humans to make another profile vulnerable to challenge\" has become a serious issue. As of the day that this HIP is being written, [57 profiles have more challenged vouched profiles than valid vouches](https://pastebin.com/8Gsj6LzQ), resulting in **211 challenges and a damage to the registrants totalling around 25 ETH**. and the number is growing. A [series](https://gov.proofofhumanity.id/t/suspicious-activity-change-to-pending-challenge-by-a-user-on-this-forum/623) [of](https://gov.proofofhumanity.id/t/penalizing-bad-vouchers/94) [governance](https://gov.proofofhumanity.id/t/correcting-submitions-before-vouching-phase-ends/404)[posts](https://gov.proofofhumanity.id/t/correcting-submitions-before-vouching-phase-ends/404) [raising the issue](https://gov.proofofhumanity.id/t/phase-1-hip-xx-allow-deposits-only-after-being-vouched/1205) and some solutions were proposed during this time. @[donosonaumczuk](https://gov.proofofhumanity.id/u/donosonaumczuk) has proposed a robust and good approach for L2 rollups and future upgrades to PoH's smart contract, but in the meantime there are possible solutions that could make it harder (important! not impossible!) for malicious actors to continue this attack. \n\n### Specification\n**1. Add removal criteria**\nIn the latest PoH policy version, there are some explicit criteria to ask for a profile removal. A new removal criteria that allows a vouchallenger to be removed can be added. We can instruct jurors that in the case of a removal of a vouchallenger, if the alleged vouchallenger challenges this removal, to rule against the vouchallenger (effectively removing them from the registry). \n\n**2. Add admission criteria**\nIn order to avoid the vouchallenge to re-register after a removal, another modification to the document will allow the cases where the removal was due to a vouchallenge to be inadmissible for a period. That base period is 120 days (4 months). A vouchallenger that continue vouchallenging after a removal will be removed again folowing **3. Conditions to consider a vouchallenger as such**. The next inadmissible periods will be calculated as `base_period*(times_removed)`. No matter the cause of the removal.\n\nParameters to consider: `base_period`\n\n**3. Conditions to consider a vouchallenger as such**\n- A profile that has vouched 2 (two) submissions that ended with 'Incorrect Submission' removal.\n- A profile that make a single (1) vouch for a submission that ends with 'Incorrect Submission' removal, after being already removed previously for being a vouchallenger.\n\nParameters to consider: `initial_vouchallenge_threshold=2`, `repeated_vouchallenge_threshold=1`\n\n**4. \"Refuse to arbitrate\" in challenges made from a re-entrant vouchallenger**\n\nIf a vouchallenger is removed and then re-registered in Proof of Humanity, every new vouchallenge must be voted as \"Refuse to Arbitrate\". \n\n**5. Retroactivity**\nThis HIP is not retroactive to profiles that performed vouchallenged in the past that cross the initial_vouchallenge_threshold. However, if a previously active vouchallenger performs a new vouch for a profile that ends with 'Incorrect Submission' removal, it will be consider a vouchallenger and will be removed.\n\n### Rationale\n* More robust solutions than this one will come in the future, but this solution tries to ammend the situation as of today, which has brought a large impact to the registration process. \n* The parameters are very strict to stop the abuse of these days. Such parameters could be changed in future HIPs. \n* The vouch process need to be enhanced and be taken seriously.\n\n\n### Implementation\n\n...More details in Phase 3... Basically, write clearly these changes in the policy. Make a PR and update the evidence in the Governor.\n",

      "title": "# HIP 73 - Removal of Clement Lesaege as mission board member",
      "content": "```\nHIP: 73\nTitle: Removal of Clement Lesaege as mission board member\nAuthor: ludoviko.eth, v4len.eth, vice, lauraleticialopez.eth (Lety), pablo, drlorente97.eth\nStatus: Phase 2\nCreated: 2022-01-06\nUpdated: 2022-10-15\n```\n\n---\n\n\n\n# Simple Summary\nThis HIP proposes the removal of Clement Leseage from the mission board and the snapshot administration.\n\n# Abstract\nThe event on EF Devcon VI where Clément produced an incident involving a violent and unsustained reaction towards Santi Siri as a speaker, has sparked debates about the fitness of Clement as a Member of the Mission Board. Based on this and previous events regarding the actions of Clement as an admin for the Snapshot polls, and the overall attitude of constantly delaying any advancement or progress of any proposals that obstructs his own agenda, the authors of this proposal are proposing:\n - The destitution of Clement Lesaege as a Mission Board Member, based on the premise that, in our opinion, he is not aligned with the values of Democratization and Decentralization and respect for privacy of individuals being registered in the DAO.\n\n# Motivation\nHere is a rundown of events that accumulated since the inception of the proposal:\n* Not acknowledging the issues regarding the concentration and dominance of a priviledged few in the Kleros Humanity Court and not doing anything to prevent such an abnormal degree of centralization.\n* Over-reaching MBM authority by numerous attempts (some successful) to demote, and then censor moderators from Telegram groups. An abuse of the mechanisms of those channels to supress dissent (36 warn actions in three days after a violent takeover of the now Kleros' PoH group). The warns and the bans in the Kleros PoH group even included other Mission Board Members since then. \n* Disregarding serious security threats to the registering process ([metadata issue](https://github.com/Proof-Of-Humanity/proof-of-humanity-web/issues/295#event-4798667830)): When warned about this issue, Clement lowered the priority of a huge security threat in which personal georeferencing data was being leaked into the registry profiles. The best answer he could give about the priority demotion he replied [“Because it's a nice to have, not a bug or a core feature.”](https://t.me/proofhumanity/28352). This was the response of people having their ethereum wallets and their physical addresses exposed in the blockchain virtually forever. The issue is still unsolved in the Kleros front-end.\n* Gerrymandering attempts by creating a set of 438 ethereum wallets that automatically delegated to him, even that up to this day, les than one third is registered or even an active member of the PoH community. The alleged \"Myanmar\" community is as of this day, completely invisible and without any signs of these people having the full picture of how the DAO works or if they had any alternatives to delegate to other candidates. \n* Systematically obstaculizing any process that helps humans register (352, vouchallengers, etc) sometimes suggesting that challenges are good and vouch-and-challenge attacks are part of the normal mechanism:\n    * Example 1, stating that [the only way to keep deposits low is keeping the challenges high](https://gov.proofofhumanity.id/t/challenges-and-removals-its-always-fair/251/10) **making Proof of Humanity a dispute-creating machine at expenses of unaware and unprepared humans**.\n    * Example 2, falsely accusing of being “undemocratic” a democratic poll [Hiring] Product Manager - #68 by clesaege 1 and this is critical for someone holding veto power in snapshot.\n    * Example 3, saying that having the opportunity to withdraw from a mistake where an innocent person is attacked by a vouchallenger is [“perfectly fine”](https://gov.proofofhumanity.id/t/phase-1-hip-12-let-users-decide-to-accept-vouches-when-your-profile-is-in-vouching-phase/583/5) and  that giving enough time for a person to correct a mistake [“courtesy” and not a right](https://gov.proofofhumanity.id/t/phase-1-hip-12-let-users-decide-to-accept-vouches-when-your-profile-is-in-vouching-phase/583/7?u=ludovico). \n* Sabotaging or lack of respect to proper procedure:\n    * Stalling the hiring process to the point that [the actual hiring was put in hibernation](https://gov.proofofhumanity.id/t/hiring-product-manager/299/68). It is also worth noting the contradiction with other comments in which he stated that hiring [should be done fast](https://gov.proofofhumanity.id/t/hiring-developer/300/5?u=ludovico).    \n    * Double standards: [Arguing about voter fatigue in proposals that he disagreed with](https://gov.proofofhumanity.id/search?q=voter%20fatigue%20%40clesaege), [creating voter fatigue himself by cloning a proposal already being voted](https://gov.proofofhumanity.id/t/phase-2-hip-18-communication-roles/816) in order to match his own individual standards.\n    * Under-specifying regulations (proposals about hiring, about creation of proposals) so that can be later interpreted as he unilaterally thinks. \n* Lack of proper spirit of collaboration with the community, showing lack of flexibility when community wanted questions answered.\n* Taking decisions in the background without proper consultation to DAO members, or disregarding alternative perspectives.\n* The removal of administrative rigths over the Snapshot platform. \n\n# Rationale\n**Clément was, is, and will still be a key and most valuable collaborator in terms of technical skills.** The accumulation of this and other events suggests that Clement is unfit to represent the DAO. This does not mean that he is unable to continue contributing in some other way, and this is not a lack of recognition that he created the protocol. \n\nThis is the third time this HIP is refloated. Originally the HIP was left on hold since its creation, but events at that time regarding removal of dissenting members of the DAO from telegram channels have sparked the interest of the community to move forward with this proposal. \n\n# Implementation\nIf Phase 3 binding vote is approved, the position that Clement Lesaege is occupying as a Mission Board Member will become vacant. Mr. Lesaege will not be able to be candidate for the Mission Board Member position (or any derivatives/equivalents from this institution, i.e., positions with executive functions) for the following 2 years starting from the Phase 3 voting. \nIn addition to this, Mr. Lesaege's administrative rigths to the snapshot platform will be removed indefinitely",

      "content": "```\nHIP: 72\ntitle: Grant to fund a PoH airdrop solution\nauthor: green\nstatus: Phase-2\ncreated: 2022-06-29\nconflicts with: None\nlanguages: EN\n```\n\n## Simple summary\n\nLaunch a grant to build an app to ease the process of airdropping to humans registered in PoH.\n\n## Abstract\n\nAirdrops are the the currently most used feature of PoH and it would be in the general interest of the DAO to provide an easy way for philanthropists to airdrop tokens to its humans. This HIP sets up a grant to incentivize building such a tool.\n\n## Motivation\n\nOn making [KIP-51](https://forum.kleros.io/t/kip-51-pnk-airdrop-to-poh-users/771), we came to realization that there is no such thing as a tool to airdrop to humans registered in PoH. Since the most interested party in the existence of such a tool is PoH DAO, and not Kleros DAO, it makes sense for PoH DAO to be the one that spends the resources needed for it to exist.\n\nOther DAOs that are interested in performing sybil resistant airdrops could use it as an easy default allocation. Then, in the future we might see projects such as Optimism liberally drop tokens to PoH.\n\n## Specification\n\nUpon completion of the PoH airdrop tool, send 3 ETH from the PoH treasury to the grantee, [forer.eth](https://etherscan.io/address/0x89c4ACb8B5b5B8E5B2121934B9e143569a914C80). If PoH treasury does not contain enough funds but they are deposited in vaults generating yield (such as the [UBI Burner](https://app.democracy.earth/#/)), then this amount will be withdrawn from the vaults and then sent to forer.eth.\n\nThe tool will work in the following way:\n\n### Contract\n\n* Anyone can create an airdrop. They pass a token, an amount per human, the merkle root, a JSON file uploaded to ipfs with info to allow for redemptions, and an optional “fee” that will be awarded to whoever processes a redemption.\n* Anyone can redeem rewards to whoever was selected, that is, registered at the time. If fees are enabled, they will get a reward for delivering the airdrop.\n\n### Subgraph\n\n* Keeps track of airdrops, redemptions, and humans. Allows fetching information quickly from the frontend.\n\n### Frontend\n\n* If the user connects with a wallet with pending airdrops, they’ll be notified and will be able to trigger the transactions needed to withdraw them.\n* It provides a way for donors to create airdrops easily. Donors can create airdrops through passing parameters in a form, allowing their tokens, and then clicking on create. The frontend will then fetch all registered humans at the time, create a merkle tree, upload it to IPFS and then finally create the airdrop in the contract.\n\n## Rationale\n\n### Why not support NFTs\n\nIt would increase the complexity severely to handle both ERC20 and NFT in the same tool. Merkle airdrop tools benefit from fungibility. To reduce the time needed to ship the tool, reducing features was chosen as the approach.\n\n### Why self-select as grantee\n\nSince I made the proposal in June 29, no one offered to take the grant. So, to avoid the proposal from getting stale, I advanced it to Phase 2 through selecting myself.\n\n### Why 3 ETH\n\nIt was approximated through the following bill of costs:\n\n* 0.5 ETH: ideation, design of the tool and stack.\n* 1 ETH: smart contract\n* 0.5 ETH: subgraph\n* 1 ETH: frontend",

A sort of game is done to verify the correctness of the phrase, by removing up to two words, independently, from both the original phrase and the announced phrase, and asserting the phrases are the same.\n\n### Motivation\n\n[This user made a profile submission ](https://www.proofofhumanity.org/profile/0xea79d166f13e4cfeb8a3014bb2cb280b20c20a5c), misreading one of the words, and it got challenged. She lost the challenge. Some time later, another user [went through the same problem](https://www.proofofhumanity.org/profile/0xc1aebd6f0d37611d744b0ecd0865984fbcb4b4c4).\n\n### Specification\n\nIncrease the amount of words in a verbal confirmation phrase to 15.\nCorrectness of an announced phrase is done as follows:\n\n1. The original phrase is written down. Up to 7 words can be omitted, and the result is stored, with the resulting words respecting the remaining order.\n2. The very same process is done with the announced phrase, which is written down as the submitter announces it. The up to two words here are independent.\n3. Both results are asserted to be the exact same. If so, confirmation is correct, otherwise, it’s incorrect.\n\n### Rationale\n\n* We can reasonably assume the shown submissions were valid in the *spirit* of PoH.\n* Using two extra words provides a buffer for mistakes to occur.\n* Making it work with a *game*, instead of hardcoding a given number of misorders, misreadings, etc, is easier to understand for verifiers.\n\n### Implementation\n\n[PR on proof-of-humanity/poh-docs ](https://github.com/Proof-Of-Humanity/poh-docs/pull/3)",

Allow challenging puppeteered submissions as **Duplicate**. A puppeteer is an actor that controls human accounts whose human does not represent themself.\n\n## Motivation\n\nIn its current state, the Policy states the registry is sybil resistant, which is a desirable trait. But the **Acceptance Criteria** was not explicit about this. This has resulted in some different strategies to creating sybils, like farming, or helping family members to get in while controlling their keys.\n\nThe point of this clause is to explicitly make the case in the rules, of something that was already implicit in the spirit of the registry. \n\n## Implementation\nMerge [this PR to the HIP-45 compliant repo](https://github.com/Proof-Of-Humanity/poh-docs/pull/1). Changes are also stated here, for completion, but in the case of conflict, the implementation to follow is the one in the PR.\n\n1. Define puppeteer as\n\n> actor that has direct control over registered human accounts that don’t represent them.\n\nand be explicit about 100% proof not needed.\n\n2. Add non-puppeteer as **Acceptance Criteria**.\n3. Add examples of puppeteers.\n4. Add puppeteering as a **Duplicate** worthy challenge.\n\nMake it clear that the burden of proof is on the challenger.\n\n---\n\nSpecifically, this is translated to the two following changes in the policy.\n\n### Add new *not-puppeteer* condition to Acceptance Criteria\n\n>- The submitter is not a puppeteer, and will not become a sybil after successful registration. A puppeteer is defined as an actor that has direct control over registered human accounts that don't represent them. Since this is very hard to prove, it is enough to invoke this criteria if it is extremely likely for the submitter to be a puppeteer. To invoke this reason, the burden of proof resides in the challenging side, in case a registration is disputed, or in the remover side, in case a profile is being removed. This side must provide an explanation for why, within reason, the submitter is a puppeteer. Given inconclusive evidence, jurors must rule in favor of including the submission.\n  - For example, a human cannot be registered if the submitter is not the same person as them.\n  - For example, a human cannot be registered if their submitter is a *farmer*, an actor that submits multiple humans.\n  - For example, a human child cannot be registered if their parent (who technically is the submitter) is controlling their private key.\n\n### Modify *Duplicate* challenge condition to allow for targetting puppeteers\n\n> - Duplicate: The submitter is already registered in the list, or the submitter is a puppeteer.\n>  - If the submitter is already registered, the challenger has to point to the identity already registered or to a duplicate submission. If someone tries to register multiple times simultaneously, all submissions are to be rejected.\n>  - If the submitter is a puppeteer, the challenging side has to prove within reason that the submitter is a puppeteer. The burden of proof resides on the challenging side, who must explain why, within a reasonable interpretation, the chances of the submitter being a puppeteer are extremely high. Dubious motives weigh in favor of including the profile.\n\n---\n\n## Rationale\n\nIt’s not possible to prove that someone is a sybil at its core, since that would imply proving they are holding other accounts’ private keys or whatever equivalent. So, an explanation with reasonable, extremely-high likely arguments for someone being a sybil, should be enough. The most important characteristic of the registry is sybil resistance, not inclusion.\n\nIt would also be desirable to treat a sybil submission challenge as a **Duplicate**, because then, whoever vouched for them gets removed as well (who, is certainly malicious, unawarely or knowingly so).\n\nPurposely, exceptions are not added. This is because, when there are exceptions in play, items that do not match the exception obtain extra legitimacy in favor of the challenger. The challenger is expected to provide the full, lengthy explanation of why the submitter is a puppeteer. The burden of evidence rests on them.\n\nSome complaints were made on why a *standard of evidence* wasn't disclosed in the proposal. This is because:\n- such a *standard* would be general to the policy, not this clause specifically. It is outside the reach of the proposal.\n- adding this *standard* can result in challenges that follow the standard to have overwhelming strength compared to the submitter. This is similar to how adding exceptions to give breathing room to submissions, makes the non-exceptions stronger challenge reasons in the eyes of the jurors.\n- the jurors already follow a *standard of evidence*. Jurors don't accept baseless claims.",

      "content": "```\nHIP: 63\ntitle: Quadratic Delegations on the DAO Snapshot\nauthor: berty.eth, avilches.eth, drlorente97.eth, @L18630, ludoviko.eth, santi.eth, v4len.eth\nstatus: Phase-2\ncreated: 2022-09-10\n```\n\n## Simple Summary\nThis HIP proposes the DAO decides implementes Quadratic Delegations on its Snapshot page for making decisions. \n\n## Abstract\nDue to recent events that led to the DAO Mission Board to [recommend the suspension of delegations](https://snapshot.org/#/pohboard.eth/proposal/0x696ac6169cc7e93af8b8dc341f55e7b18a03b974678bda7f2ccb5c71d4b343de), we have put forward this proposal in order to allow the DAO to implement a mechanism of Quadratic Delegations that will help prevent clientelism and vote gerrymandering.\n\n## Motivation\n\nDelegations have been subject of controversy since they potentially allow clientelism and ultimately create a dynamic where a handful of whales end up making the decisions on behalf of the community. \n\nAt the same time, delegations can happen naturally on cyberspace whether Snapshot allows it or not, with applications that can replicate automatically the vote of a person. This is why it is often considered UX to make these easily available in the User Interface so everyone can play with the same rules. \n\n## Specification\n\nWe propose a new alternative regarding delegations.\n\n-  **Quadratic Delegations**: People are free to delegate their vote, but delegations get tallied quadratically. This means that the square root of the delegations received is counted rather than the full amount of delegations. \n\nThis model brings the following advantages to the governance dynamics of the DAO:\n\n- Mitigates gerrymandering attacks by limiting the influence of a delegate\n- Mitigates clientelist attacks by limiting the influence of a delegate\n- Incentivizes voters to delegate to those with fewer delegations rather than large whales\n- Incentivizes that voters prioritize using direct vote to override delegate vote.\n- Incentivize groups of delegates to organize collectiviely rather than seek individual power.\n- Values the creation of an ecosystem of multiple minorities rather than bipartidism.\n\n## Implementation\n\nTo implement Quadratic Delegations, the `math` module must be implemented on Snapshot in replacement of `erc20-balance-of-delegation` using the following script: \n\n```\n{\n  \"symbol\": \"QDelegates\",\n  \"operands\": [\n    {\n      \"type\": \"strategy\",\n      \"strategy\": {\n        \"network\": \"1\",\n        \"name\": \"erc20-balance-of-delegation\",\n        \"params\": {\n          \"symbol\": \"VOTE\",\n          \"address\": \"0x1dAD862095d40d43c2109370121cf087632874dB\",\n          \"decimals\": 0\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  ],\n  \"operation\": \"square-root\"\n}\n```\n\nA test implemetation of Quadratic Delegations can be found on this https://snapshot.org/#/proofofhumanity.eth/proposal/0x026401dffb85dafe9e735f9271118106e08d8bc685bb55207244b0afc9c66ccb poll.\n\n",

Proof of Humanity governance is maturing and we recognize that we need a guiding constitution. The [Proof of Humanity Constitution](https://ipfs.kleros.io/ipfs/QmNsWbBsd3erqYPqu3bFyDfJZU3gejnk49F6eCH7w1aFo8/Proof%20of%20Humanity%20Constitution.pdf) is intended to establish a minimal functioning set of rules and principles,\n\n1. Principle of Sybil Resistance\n2. Principle of Non-Discrimination\n3. Principle of 1p1v\n4. Principle of Wide Pluralistic Consensus\n\n## Motivation\n\n\nProof of Humanity survived many governance struggles this year, including proposals which would ineffect break the sybil resistance of the protocol. These governance struggles are not a recent problem either.\n\nI highly recommend you watch [Jimmy Ragosa's talk](https://youtu.be/HDSZsl1Zk4c?t=155) motivating a need for a constitution for Proof of Humanity. If you do not click now, please come back to the link after reading the proposal.\n\nObserve that many of the constructive HIPs (below) [historically pass](https://snapshot.org/#/poh.eth/) with a large consensus.\n\n* HIP28: Update submissionBaseDeposit 99%\n* HIP19: Code of Conduct for PoH Telegram channels 100%\n* HIP45: Markdown policy, 100%\n* HIP36: Registration Validitity extension 99%\n* HIP37: EPNS delegate 99%\n* HIP30: PoH Governor Deposit Update 100%\n\nWhile lots of the politically motivated HIPs were passed or failed with a slim margin.\n\n* HIP50: Official Social Media Groups 60%\n* HIP-49: Change of Arbitrator 48%\n* HIP 48 - Removal of Clement Lesaege 39%\n\nProof of Humanity like other DAOs suffers low participation rates. Typical voter turnout with delegations on is in the ~800 range, with only around ~100 users signing messages out of a total of 16,000+ registered humans.\n\nLast year when POH launched I proposed [quorums](https://gov.proofofhumanity.id/t/proposals-require-quorum-to-pass/412) as a minimum voter participation rate to pass HIPs. I am now convinced one year later that quorums are not a good solution since this would result in deadlock.\n\nInstead, in the interests of promoting a wide consensus amongst a wide plurality of voices, a higher voting threshold is proposed which will require a wide consensus amongst a plurality of different PoH members.\n\n## Specification\n\nSpecify the [Proof of Humanity Constitution](https://ipfs.kleros.io/ipfs/QmNsWbBsd3erqYPqu3bFyDfJZU3gejnk49F6eCH7w1aFo8/Proof%20of%20Humanity%20Constitution.pdf) as governance rules by amending the [Proof of Humanity Governor Primary Policy](https://ipfs.kleros.io/ipfs/QmPt2oTHCYZYUShuLxiK4QWH6sXPHjvgXTqMDpCShKogQY/KlerosGovernorPrimaryDocument.pdf) and specifying the amended document with the function,\n\n    function changeMetaEvidence(string _metaEvidence) public onlyByGovernor\n\non the [POH Governor](https://gov.proofofhumanity.id/t/phase-1-uip-3-update-ubi-governor-deposit-cost/2131) contract [0x327a29fcE0a6490E4236240Be176dAA282EcCfdF](https://etherscan.io/address/0x327a29fcE0a6490E4236240Be176dAA282EcCfdF)\n\n## Rationale\n\n1. Principle of Sybil Resistance\n\nIn light of HIP-49 which nearly broke the sybil resistance of the protocol by changing the arbitrator to a non-functional arbitrator, we require that all HIPs which clearly and demonstrably break the sybil resistance of the protocol be forbidden.\n\n2. Principle of Non-Discrimination\n\nAs discussed in [HIP-11](https://gov.proofofhumanity.id/t/phase-1-hip-11-establish-a-set-of-guiding-principles-for-proof-of-humanity/559) and [HIP-19](https://gov.proofofhumanity.id/t/phase-3-hip-19-code-of-conduct-for-poh-telegram-channels/769/10) about guiding principles and guidelines, Proof of Humanity commits to the principle of non-discrimination. Proof of Humanity is an open, permissionless protocol for all humans making no distinction of gender, sexual orientation, disability, ethnicity, religion, or age.\n\n3. Principle of 1p1v\n\nAccordingly, with the principle of equality above, Proof of Humanity also commits to the principle of 1 human 1 vote either voting directly or by delegation.\n\n4. Principle of Wide Pluralistic Consensus\n\n* A **minimum threshold of 3/4** cast votes is required to pass constitutional HIPs, these are HIPs which modify the constitution \n* A **minimum threshold of 2/3** is required to pass final phase, Phase 3, HIPs.\n* A **minimum threshold of 1/2** is required to pass intermediate phase, Phase 2, HIPs.\n\nThis ensures that a vocal minority (1/4) can essentially veto constitutional HIPs while ensuring that a consensus amongst a wide plurality of POH members must be reached inorder to pass constitutional HIPs. Ideally we can avoid a polarity in governance where sides are split 60/40, but where we need to cooperate and achieve a large consensus to improve POH.\n\nHaving considered the discussion in phase 1, seeing the merits off efficacy in a 2/3 threshold for non-constitutional HIPs, the above compromise was made so that non-constitutional HIPs are subjected to a lower threshold than constitutional HIPs for effective governance.",

Allow challenging sybil submissions as **Duplicate**. A sybil is an actor that controls human accounts whose human does not represent themself.\n\n## Motivation\n\nIn its current state, the Policy states the registry is sybil resistant, which is a desirable trait. But the **Acceptance Criteria** was not explicit about this. This has resulted in some different strategies to creating sybils, like farming, or helping family members to get in while controlling their keys.\n\n## Implementation\n\nMerge [this PR to the HIP-45 compliant repo ](https://github.com/Proof-Of-Humanity/poh-docs/pull/1). Changes are also stated here, for completion: (but, the authoritative wording is in the PR)\n\n1. Define sybil as\n\n> actor that has direct control over registered human accounts that don’t represent them\n\nand be explicit about 100% proof not needed.\n\n2. Add non-sybil as **Acceptance Criteria**.\n3. Add examples of sybils.\n4. Add sybil as **Duplicate** worthy challenge.\n\n## Rationale\n\nIt’s not possible to prove that someone is a sybil at its core, since that would imply proving they are holding other accounts’ private keys or whatever equivalent. So, an explanation with reasonable, extremely-high likely arguments for someone being a sybil, should be enough. The most important characteristic of the registry is sybil resistance, not inclusion.\n\nIt would also be desirable to treat a sybil submission challenge as a **Duplicate**, because then, whoever vouched for them gets removed as well (who, is certainly malicious, unawarely or knowingly so).",

      "title": "[Phase-2][Signalling] HIP-63 Quadratic Delegations on the DAO Snapshot",
      "content": "```\nHIP: 63\ntitle: Quadratic Delegations on the DAO Snapshot\nauthor: berty.eth, avilches.eth, drlorente97.eth, @L18630, ludoviko.eth, santi.eth, v4len.eth\nstatus: Phase-2\ncreated: 2022-09-10\n```\n\n### Simple Summary\nThis HIP proposes the DAO decides implementes Quadratic Delegations on its Snapshot page for making decisions. \n\n### Abstract\nDue to recent events that led to the DAO Mission Board to [recommend the suspension of delegations](https://snapshot.org/#/pohboard.eth/proposal/0x696ac6169cc7e93af8b8dc341f55e7b18a03b974678bda7f2ccb5c71d4b343de), we have put forward this proposal in order to allow the DAO to implement a mechanism of Quadratic Delegations that will help prevent clientelism and vote gerrymandering.\n\n### Motivation\n\nDelegations have been subject of controversy since they potentially allow clientelism and ultimately create a dynamic where a handful of whales end up making the decisions on behalf of the community. \n\nAt the same time, delegations can happen naturally on cyberspace whether Snapshot allows it or not, with applications that can replicate automatically the vote of a person. This is why it is often considered UX to make these easily available in the User Interface so everyone can play with the same rules. \n\n### Specification\n\nWe propose a new alternative regarding delegations.\n\n-  **Quadratic Delegations**: People are free to delegate their vote, but delegations get tallied quadratically. This means that the square root of the delegations received is counted rather than the full amount of delegations. \n\nThis model brings the following advantages to the governance dynamics of the DAO:\n\n- Mitigates gerrymandering attacks by limiting the influence of a delegate\n- Mitigates clientelist attacks by limiting the influence of a delegate\n- Incentivizes voters to delegate to those with fewer delegations rather than large whales\n- Incentivizes that voters prioritize using direct vote to override delegate vote.\n- Incentivize groups of delegates to organize collectiviely rather than seek individual power.\n- Values the creation of an ecosystem of multiple minorities rather than bipartidist politics.\n\n### Implementation\n\nTo implement Quadratic Delegations, the `math` module must be implemented on Snapshot in replacement of `erc20-balance-of-delegation` using the following script: \n\n```\n{\n  \"symbol\": \"QDelegates\",\n  \"operands\": [\n    {\n      \"type\": \"strategy\",\n      \"strategy\": {\n        \"network\": \"1\",\n        \"name\": \"erc20-balance-of-delegation\",\n        \"params\": {\n          \"symbol\": \"VOTE\",\n          \"address\": \"0x1dAD862095d40d43c2109370121cf087632874dB\",\n          \"decimals\": 0\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  ],\n  \"operation\": \"square-root\"\n}\n```\n\nA test implemetation of Quadratic Delegations can be found on this [Snapshot page](https://snapshot.org/#/proofofhumanity.eth/proposal/0x026401dffb85dafe9e735f9271118106e08d8bc685bb55207244b0afc9c66ccb).\n\n### Additonal notes.\n\n[Glen Weyl](https://twitter.com/glenweyl/status/1569350890468904960?s=20&t=-PdaT_Z-XOGudMf51eg7Gg), author of the original paper on Quadratic Voting and the book \"Radical Markets\" has pronounced himself in favor of the idea on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/glenweyl/status/1569350890468904960?s=20&t=-PdaT_Z-XOGudMf51eg7Gg).",

A sort of game is done to verify the correctness of the phrase, by removing up to two words, independently, from both the original phrase and the announced phrase, and asserting the phrases are the same.\n\n### Motivation\n\n[This user made a profile submission](https://www.proofofhumanity.org/profile/0xea79d166f13e4cfeb8a3014bb2cb280b20c20a5c), misreading one of the words, and it got challenged. She lost the challenge. Some time later, another user [went through the same problem](https://www.proofofhumanity.org/profile/0xc1aebd6f0d37611d744b0ecd0865984fbcb4b4c4).\n\n### Specification\n\nIncrease the amount of words in a verbal confirmation phrase to 15.\nCorrectness of an announced phrase is done as follows:\n\n1. The original phrase is written down. Up to 7 words can be omitted, and the result is stored, with the resulting words respecting the remaining order.\n2. The very same process is done with the announced phrase, which is written down as the submitter announces it. The up to two words here are independent.\n3. Both results are asserted to be the exact same. If so, confirmation is correct, otherwise, it’s incorrect.\n\n### Rationale\n\n* We can reasonably assume the shown submissions were valid in the *spirit* of PoH.\n* Using two extra words provides a buffer for mistakes to occur.\n* Making it work with a *game*, instead of hardcoding a given number of misorders, misreadings, etc, is easier to understand for verifiers.\n\n### Implementation\n\n[PR on proof-of-humanity/poh-docs ](https://github.com/Proof-Of-Humanity/poh-docs/pull/3)",

These have had an effect on the incentivization of challengers. Also, as a result of the passage of [HIP-17](https://snapshot.org/#/poh.eth/proposal/Qmdc5SzL1Uxny2u5M2J933483ijnnpbxxsETioqAPSBPZn), challengers will only have to lock up enough ETH to cover the arbitration costs of one juror arbitration rather than three jurors reducing the risks that they have to be compensated to take on.\n\nThe value of **0.055 ETH** was generated by this [calculator](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1VR7_DM1cs1SVGiENwcACSh_vXs6mrwk8?usp=sharing), which was also used to generated these [proposed updates to the Kleros court parameters](https://forum.kleros.io/t/kip-49-parameter-updates-june-2022/755) that are being considered by the Kleros governance process in parallel. Note that the Kleros court parameter updates would have an effect on the arbitration cost part of PoH submission deposits; and given that the gas situation has changed again, after the proposal gets updated to reflect August gas prices, if both proposals pass the new total deposit would be around **0.055 + 0.015 = 0.07 ETH**.\n\nWith the current juror fees of **0.025 ETH**, which will remain until Kleros passes said proposal, the total deposit will remain around **0.055 + 0.025 = 0.08 ETH**.\n\nYou will note that the calculator attempts to make the `submissionBaseDeposit` satisfy two constraints:\n\n1. There is a notion of the theoretical reward that is sufficient to adequately incentivize challengers in fiat terms. Then challengers should reliably receive this average reward after gas in a “normal” gas environment, which in this case the calculator conservatively takes to be up to 30 gwei. (Normally the theoretical reward would not signficantly change from one update to the next; however as a result of HIP-17 reducing the challenger deposit/ the risk the challenger must take on, I recalculated this. This essentially consisted of updating the value of J i.e. the total arbitration fees in the formulas in this [blog post](https://blog.kleros.io/the-challengers-dilemma-decentralized-law-enforcement/) and solving for C i.e. the challenge reward that retains the original level of security.)\n2. A successful challenge should receive a large enough reward to cover the gas of challenging even in fairly severe gas conditions, which in this case the calculator takes to be up to 80 gwei.\n\nIn this case, it is actually the second constraint that is sharp. Namely, the requirement that the challenger reward should exceed gas costs even in fairly pessimistic gas assumptions prevents one from taking a lower value.\n\n## Specification\n\nThis would be done by using the `changeSubmissionBaseDeposit` function in the Proof of Humanity contract. This would be submitted as a transaction from the PoH Governor.\n\n## Implementation\n\nHave the PoH governor make the following call on the PoH contract:\n\n`changeSubmissionBaseDeposit(55000000000000000)`",

The very next election will be held when the position of the mayority of members expire, voting 5 members again. \nThe [past votation](https://snapshot.org/#/poh.eth/proposal/0x2e768e76c5b0b9dc9dad7043ad486f13241464a7eedfe26318fd4a38555dc726) was in may 28, 2022. So, the MB that asumed in this day, has 1 year in the position.\nIf someone were to take over as MB afterwards, his term might be shorter. In this way, future elections will all take place in the same moment.\n\n\n----\n\n\n**Versión en español**\n\n**Resumen Simple**\n\nModificar la duración del tiempo en el cargo de los Miembros de la Junta de Misión de (máximo) **5 años** (periodo actual establecido por la HIP-39) **a 1 año**, según  lo [votado en phase 2](https://snapshot.org/#/poh.eth/proposal/0xbb124fc439bc108dfb3f33979c33c40abc55c61bf801116b0eba89a2a3bd015f).\n\n**Resumen**\n\nDesde la aprobación de esta HIP con votación de la mayoría en la fase 3 en la plataforma Snapshot el periodo de los miembros de la junta de mission no podrá exceder el tiempo votado con mayoría de votos, desde el momento de su nombramiento en el cargo.\nSera posible la reelección de cada miembro, las elecciones para la renovación de la junta deberán realizarse antes de que finalicen su gestión.\ndebe ser dentro del mismo periodo.\n\n\n**Motivación**\n\nLa reglamentación actual sobre la duración de la estadía en la junta de misión no es precisa y estipula que “un miembro puede permanecer en su cargo de 1 a 5 años”, siendo 5 años mucho tiempo en el ecosistema web.\n\nNecesitamos definir y dejar en claro el tiempo de estadía de los miembros para someter a juicio el poder y labor de los mismos, adoptando una práctica habitual de elección de autoridades en la DAO.\n\n**Especificación**\n\nEl tiempo del cargo de las juntas de Misión será de **1 año** por período a partir del momento en que se apruebe esta propuesta. La próxima elección se llevará a cabo cuando expire el cargo de la mayoría de los miembros, votando 5 miembros nuevamente.\nLa [votación pasada](https://snapshot.org/#/poh.eth/proposal/0x2e768e76c5b0b9dc9dad7043ad486f13241464a7eedfe26318fd4a38555dc726) fue el **28 de mayo** de 2022. Por lo tanto, los MB que asumieron en este día, deben permanecer como máximo 1 año en el cargo.\nSi alguien asumiera como MB después, su período podría ser más corto.\nDe esta forma, las futuras elecciones se realizarán todas en el mismo momento.",

      "title": "[Phase 2] HIP-54: Airdrop to Democratic Heroes",
      "content": "```\nHIP: 54\ntitle: Airdrop to Democratic Heroes\nauthors: Spoon\nstatus: Phase 2\ncreated: 2022-08-10\nconflicts with: None\nlanguages: EN\n```\n\n# Simple Summary\n\nUse the WETH funds currently owned by the DAO to airdrop humans who have actively participated in POH. This is the most democratic way of allocating the funds, because even minorities will have a voice on how to use the DAO’s assets and we will avoid any fund allocation drama. Each politically active human supporting this HIP will receive around 0.04648-0.090 ETH (~82-165 USD at the time of writing).\n\nThe airdrop will happen on the Gnosis Chain in order to bootstrap the POH/UBI Gnosis ecosystem.\n\n# Abstract\n\nAs most people reading this may know, active humans have contributed greatly to the adoption and improvement of Proof of Humanity over the past year and a half. The following is a non exhaustive list of contributions:\n\n* Organizing vouching groups and participating in them. Not only free vouching for people who don’t know anyone inside POH is provided, but also has the humanitarian function of checking the profiles to prevent honest mistakes in submissions.\n* Crowdfunding submissions. Several people have organized groups that help poor people register POH and provided funds + gas fees necessary to do so.\n* Volunteer developers have contributed to the project from different angles. Just to name a few examples (but there are so many more!): Ruben’s UBI Burner, Emiliano’s Vaults, JuanuMusic’s Posta and UBI v2, Billinkis’ contributions to the UI.\n* Several people have spent countless hours trying to improve the registration policies as can be seen in several HIPs and forums.\n* Social media volunteers, such as telegram and discord admins, people who help others during onboarding and creators of tutorials and documentation.\n* Some others, like the Proof of Integrity folks, go an extra mile to educate people in need about financial freedom, UBI and POH.\n* Democratic participation itself is an honorable task.\n* Of course all the work by the Kleros team.\n\nMost of the politically active humans have already dedicated their time and money to improve POH and make it grow. Something fascinating is that this energy, far from dwindling, is increasing.\n\n#### Listening to every single voice\n\nI’ve seen too many different views about how to spend or not spend the DAO’s assets. To be honest, most of them seem like a good idea. The problem is that it is hard to reach a consensus and, if we do, the majority would be imposing their ideas over the minorities.\n\nIf we agree on an airdrop to the people who actively participate in POH, then each individual will use the airdrop as they best see fit. Some may organize themselves to fund the research of alternative arbitrators or of Proof of Humanity iterations (v2, v3, etc.). Some others may use the airdrop to keep building. Others may use it to help and educate new users, advertise the project and increase adoption. Some others may use it for themselves (and that is ok too! They’ve earned it, so we could see that as retroactive funding). The airdrop will also help the adoption of POH/UBI related dapps being developed on the Gnosis Chain.\n\nAs an example: HIP-49 got 247 supporters but that wasn’t enough to pass the proposal. If these 247 humans are really interested in alternative arbitrators, they can campaign to use the ETH from this airdrop to research and develop it.\n\nI’ll argue with anyone that an airdrop like this is the most democratic way of allocating the DAO’s funds.\n\n# Motivation\n\nLet the politically active humans decide the allocation of resources democratically and without imposing ideas over minorities. Boost the POH/UBI ecosystem.\n\n# Specification\n\nDistribute all the WETH (~46.48) among humans that {1} are registered in POH, {2} vote in favor of this HIP (phase 2 & 3) and {3} have voted in at least one HIP in Snapshot before the date this post (not the Phase-1 post) was published. Humans who voted through delegation are eligible. HIPs that are currently being voted do not count.\n\nIf my calculations are right, there are around ~1000 eligible humans, which means that at least each one of them will be entitled to ~0.04648 WETH (85 USD at the time of writing). If Snapshot participation is low, the airdrop will be bigger.\n\n# Implementation\n\nTo make the airdrop more efficient and support the human ecosystem being built (POHv2, UBIv2, Yubiai, Social Media, TalentLayer, the prediction markets project, draw attention from Circle UBI supporters, etc.), the WETH will be bridged to Gnosis Chain to an airdrop contract. Airdrop smart contracts already exist, which means that we won’t need to implement one. Once this HIP gets approved, we will need to prepare the merkle proofs for said contract.",

      "content": "# HIP-28: Update submissionBaseDeposit\n\n```\nHIP: 28\ntitle: Update submissionBaseDeposit\nauthors: William George, @greenlucid\nstatus: Phase 2\ncreated: 2021-08-24\nconflicts with: None\nlanguages: EN\n```\n\n# Simple Summary\n\nThis proposal would adjust the parameter that determines the part of submission deposits that is used to incentivize challengers.\n\n# Abstract\n\nUpdate the `submissionBaseDeposit`, which is currently **0.1 ETH**, to **0.055 ETH**.\n\n# Motivation\n\nSince the `submissionBaseDeposit` was set, there have been considerable fluctuations in ETH prices as well as in gas prices. These have had an effect on the incentivization of challengers. Also, as a result of the passage of [HIP-17](https://snapshot.org/#/poh.eth/proposal/Qmdc5SzL1Uxny2u5M2J933483ijnnpbxxsETioqAPSBPZn), challengers will only have to lock up enough ETH to cover the arbitration costs of one juror arbitration rather than three jurors reducing the risks that they have to be compensated to take on.\n\nThe value of **0.055 ETH** was generated by this [calculator](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1VR7_DM1cs1SVGiENwcACSh_vXs6mrwk8?usp=sharing), which was also used to generated these [proposed updates to the Kleros court parameters](https://forum.kleros.io/t/kip-49-parameter-updates-june-2022/755) that are being considered by the Kleros governance process in parallel. Note that the Kleros court parameter updates would have an effect on the arbitration cost part of PoH submission deposits; and given that the gas situation has changed again, after the proposal gets updated to reflect August gas prices, if both proposals pass the new total deposit would be around **0.055 + 0.015 = 0.07 ETH**.\n\nWith the current juror fees of **0.025 ETH**, which will remain until Kleros passes said proposal, the total deposit will remain around **0.055 + 0.025 = 0.08 ETH**.\n\nYou will note that the calculator attempts to make the `submissionBaseDeposit` satisfy two constraints:\n\n1. There is a notion of the theoretical reward that is sufficient to adequately incentivize challengers in fiat terms. Then challengers should reliably receive this average reward after gas in a “normal” gas environment, which in this case the calculator conservatively takes to be up to 30 gwei. (Normally the theoretical reward would not signficantly change from one update to the next; however as a result of HIP-17 reducing the challenger deposit/ the risk the challenger must take on, I recalculated this. This essentially consisted of updating the value of J i.e. the total arbitration fees in the formulas in this [blog post](https://blog.kleros.io/the-challengers-dilemma-decentralized-law-enforcement/) and solving for C i.e. the challenge reward that retains the original level of security.)\n2. A successful challenge should receive a large enough reward to cover the gas of challenging even in fairly severe gas conditions, which in this case the calculator takes to be up to 80 gwei.\n\nIn this case, it is actually the second constraint that is sharp. Namely, the requirement that the challenger reward should exceed gas costs even in fairly pessimistic gas assumptions prevents one from taking a lower value.\n\n# Specification\n\nThis would be done by using the `changeSubmissionBaseDeposit` function in the Proof of Humanity contract. This would be submitted as a transaction from the PoH Governor.\n\n`changeSubmissionBaseDeposit(55000000000000000)`",

The very next election will be held when the position of the mayority of members expire, voting 5 members again. In this way, future elections will all take place in the same moment.\n\n----\n\n\n**Version en espanol**\n\n**Resumen Simple**\n\nModificar la duración del tiempo en el cargo de los Miembros de la Junta de Mision de (máximo) 5 años (periodo actual establecido por la HIP-39) a 1 o 2 años.\n\n**Resumen**\n\nDesde la aprobación de esta HIP con votación de la mayoría en la fase 3 en la plataforma Snapshot el periodo de los miembros de la junta de mission no podrá exceder el tiempo votado con mayoría de votos, desde el momento de su nombramiento en el cargo.\nSera posible la reelección de cada miembro, las elecciones para la renovación de la junta deberán realizarse antes de que finalicen su gestión.\ndebe ser dentro del mismo periodo.\nLa siguiente votación, deberá llevarse a cabo, en el momento en el que vence el periodo de la mayoría de los Mission Board.\n\n**Motivación**\n\nLa reglamentación actual sobre la duración de la estadía en la junta de misión no es precisa y estipula que “un miembro puede permanecer en su cargo de 1 a 5 años”, siendo 5 años mucho tiempo en el ecosistema web.\n\nNecesitamos definir y dejar en claro el tiempo de estadía de los miembros para someter a juicio el poder y labor de los mismos, adoptando una práctica habitual de elección de autoridades en la DAO.\n\n**Especificación**\n\nEl tiempo del cargo de Mission board, pasara a ser de *1 o 2 años por periodo*. Y se llamara nuevamente a votación en el momento que termine el puesto de la mayoría de miembros. Votando así a 5 miembros nuevamente.\n\nDe esta forma, logramos que las siguientes votaciones, sean todas en el mismo momento.",

      "title": "[Phase 3] [Binding] HIP 45: PDF → Markdown",
      "content": "```\nHIP: 45\ntitle: Rewrite Policy in Markdown instead of PDF\nauthor: @greenlucid\nstatus: Phase 3\ncreated: 2022-06-23\nconflicts with: None\nlanguages: EN\n```\n\n## Simple Summary\n\nMigrate the policy from PDF to Markdown, and edit the policy in a repository.\n\n## Abstract\n\nPolicies should be written and edited in Markdown. This makes coordination easier and, in particular, speeds up policy editions, even more so when dealing with concurrent HIPs. A repository will be built under [Proof of Humanity GitHub](https://github.com/Proof-Of-Humanity/) for this purpose.\n\n## Motivation\n\nUsing pdf as the raw document for a policy is a coordination disaster. There is too much friction around making changes to the policy to integrate the HIPs that affect it. With a PDF, the latest working document must also be made available, which introduces delays. Also, to make this new quality of life explicit, a repository will be used to coordinate the changes.\n\n## Rationale\n\nThe format should be easy to edit, audit, and replicate. The format should make it easy to follow changes and notice mistakes, just like code repositories do. Code repositories are the state of the art solution to coordinate changes across technical files (*source code*), so it makes sense to also use a repository for a critical document such as the PoH registration policy.\n\nThe official [Proof of Humanity GitHub](https://github.com/Proof-Of-Humanity/) was chosen as a default option, but this HIP does not mandate it must be the only repository to use. Although, it is recommended to contribute all changes in the same repository, for clarity.\n\n## Implementation\n\nMake a repository for the express purpose of containing this policy, or other important files (such as the `MetaEvidence` jsons). This rewrite of the policy will be the starting basis for the repository:\n\n[poh-policy.md ](https://github.com/greenlucid/poh-policy/blob/master/poh-policy.md) (feel free to make PRs to fix issues during this Phase 2)\n[Rendered sample ](https://ipfs.kleros.io/ipfs/QmTbxCZQL28w6TFgJ6XBPqmBuw2eeNtR9T5u3tYJgEJhLt/Proof%20of%20Humanity%20Registry%20Policy.pdf) (this render is not particularly good)\n\nThe process to edit and champion HIPs that modify the policy should be the following:\n\n* The champion of the HIP forks the repository containing the policy.\n* The champion creates a draft Pull Request to the base repository with the name of the HIP and a link to the HIP in the description.\n* The champion writes the changes to the policy, and asks for reviews and feedback. This can be done during Phase 1 or Phase 2.\n* After the feedback process, the PR stops being a Draft and no further changes are allowed. The HIP then gets to Phase 3.\n* If the HIP passes, the PR is merged.\n\nWhen this HIP is merged, the Markdown document that was specified above, will be provided as it is, without rendering, as a plain Markdown file, on the MetaEvidence.\n\n## FAQ\n\n### Who are “the reviewers”?\n\nThis is purposely under-specified. It could just be voluntaries or enthusiasts, but there’s no explicit need for them to be authority figures, or Mission Board members. My suggestion is that a few eyes that don’t agree with the HIP should also take a look.\n\n### Isn’t this complicated for non-technical contributors?\n\nIt’s certainly not harder than what we currently have. But, if this was the case, I will write a short guide on how to join a repository and follow the steps for non-technical people to champion or contribute to HIPs.\n\n### Won’t it be ugly for the users to show a raw text file?\nIt is possible to use a browser extension to render markdown dynamically. [This is such an example ](https://github.com/KeithLRobertson/markdown-viewer).\n\nAs a previous step to this Phase 3, a [signaling vote was made](https://snapshot.org/#/proofofhumanity.eth/proposal/0x927babd661f1706b3b16af8991daec63be52bd4b87e1f4ab3a8206fa8f9ecd1b) to decide whether if the Policy should be published as Markdown or PDF. The voters decided to continue with the Policy being published as a Markdown file in the MetaEvidence.  Some discussion of pros and cons was made on the topic. This is not final: if the Phase 3 rejects this migration, this whole process could take place again to decide if the Policy should be Markdown of a PDF render.\n\n### Where is the markdown policy kept?\n\nIt doesn’t matter if it’s published as a raw markdown or published as pdf, it should be kept in a repository in any case, to allow following the process indicated in the *implementation* header.\nAs for the specific question of, in which repository, I would suggest to use the [official Proof of Humanity GitHub repository ](https://github.com/Proof-Of-Humanity/).\n",

The tokenomics of the new Arbitrator will not be modified with neither UBI nor an alternative new token. **PNK will remain as the only staking token valid for this new arbitrator.** \n\n### Motivation\n\nThe Kleros Arbitration smart contracts that are being used by the Proof of Humanity protocol and the Proof of Humanity DAO are currently governed by the Kleros Coop where they are the only entity that can define its parameters moving forward. \n\nOur aim is to further decentralize the Proof of Humanity project by using the democratic processes put in place by the Proof of Humanity DAO. During the first year of our DAO, not a single election has been disputed with over 40 decisions being made by the DAO and the combination of Proof of Humanity with Snapshot has proven to be an efficient approach to democratic decision making. \n\nOur goal is to use this mechanism to decide over the Arbitrator being used by the Protocol and the DAO's Governor contract.\n\n\n### Specification\n\nAny potential dispute that emerges today either from the Proof of Humanity Governor or the Proof of Humanity DAO will go to an Arbitrator contract that ultimately has its parameters set by the Kleros Coop.\n\nA comparison between the vote distribution in the decision making process between the Proof of Humanity DAO and the Kleros Coop show very different distribution of power on each organization:\n\n![Proof of Humanity DAO](https://gov.proofofhumanity.id/uploads/default/original/1X/e65fa8189d1f22457c13cbd8bfd22a10fd06ea66.jpeg)\n\n![Kleros Coop](https://gov.proofofhumanity.id/uploads/default/original/1X/c3e9c0fe4800da1c99aa086bece58d04b610e43a.jpeg)\n\nAs much as we trust the knowledge and experience that Kleros has contributed to the Proof of Humanity project, by advancing with this change the Proof of Humanity community will be able to set the rules for its own Arbitration mechanisms and take an effective step towards greater decentralization.\n\n**No project ever begins decentralized. It's up to the community to take the necessary steps to guarantee progressive decentralization. With the approval of this proposal we are taking a critical step in that direction.**\n\nFor this purpose, we will deploy a new contract that follows the same exact settings the current Arbitrator has but with its Governor set to the Proof of Humanity Governor. And the Proof of Humanity Governor's Arbitrator will be set to the new Arbitrator being deployed.\n\n\n### Rationale\n\nThe incorporation of an Arbitrator dependent of the Proof of Humanity DAO would reduce the risk of the DAO being captured in a Governance Gridlock by actors that are not aligned with the core interests of Proof of Humanity. \n\nThis change will increase the robustness of the DAO, in accordance to a more mature decentralization since every verified human will have a right to vote over the parameters of the Arbitrator. \n\nAdditionally, we would be able to modify the Governor with the power of *1 person 1 vote*, giving the DAO sovereign control over its own Dispute resolution courts. \n\nDAO control over the arbitrator and its governor is key to emancipate Proof of Humanity as an autonomous organization free from centralized interests.\n\nWith autonomy over the design of the courts we can later add after careful Tokenomics research the possibility of limiting large concentrations of staking, and incentivizing the same principles of equal access to justice within our Registry. \n\nAnother advantage that we have over the Kleros Courts is that Humanity Court can better specify and regulate juror misconduct or exploitative behaviours in a faster, more efficient way.\n\nFuture implementations of Courts serving the Proof of Humanity protocol —whether its Kleros v2 or a new compatible Arbitator— can only be accepted if they also follow the configurations described on this HIP and thus maintain the Proof of Humanity Governor as the Arbitrator Governor. No other settings can be accepted in the case of a Court Update in the future. \n\n### Implementation\n\nAn exact replica of the existing Kleros arbitration contract will be deployed on Ethereum Mainnet. \n\nThe same version of `KlerosLiquid.sol` smart contract found on Proof of Humanity's current court available on `0x988b3A538b618C7A603e1c11Ab82Cd16dbE28069` will be used.\n\nThe new court will be deployed with the following settings in its `constructor` function:\n\n```\n// The governor of the contract will be set to the Proof of Humanity governor.\naddress _governor = 0x327a29fcE0a6490E4236240Be176dAA282EcCfdF\n\n// The pinakion token contract will keep using the PNK token.\nPinakion _pinakion = 0x93ed3fbe21207ec2e8f2d3c3de6e058cb73bc04d\n\n// The random number generator contract will keep using the existing RNG.\nRNG _RNGenerator = 0x1738B62E403090666687243e758b1C29eDfFc90e\n\n// The minimum staking time.\nuint _minStakingTime = 8700000000000000000000\n\n// The maximum drawing time.\nuint _maxDrawingTime = 7200\n\n// Whether to use commit and reveal or not.\nbool _hiddenVotes = false\n\n// Minimum tokens needed to stake in the court.\nuint _minStake = 8700000000000000000000\n\n// Basis point of tokens that are lost when incoherent.\nuint _alpha = 5000\n\n// Arbitration fee paid per juror.\nuint _feeForJuror = 25000000000000000\n\nuint _jurorsForCourtJump = 31\n\n// The time allotted to each dispute period in the form `timesPerPeriod[period]`.\nuint[4] _timesPerPeriod = [540000, 437400, 437400, 291600]\n\n// The number of children per node of the general court's sortition sum tree.\nuint _sortitionSumTreeK = 8\n\n```\n\nOnce this contract has been successfully deployed on mainnet, it will be set to have a Court with ID 1 that will work as the Humanity Court that will be linked to Proof of Humanity. \n\nThen the following tickets will be submitted to the Proof of Humanity Governor:\n\n- *HIP 49 Change the Arbitrator of the Proof of Humanity Protocol*: The Proof of Humanity protocol (`0xC5E9dDebb09Cd64DfaCab4011A0D5cEDaf7c9BDb`) will execute `changeArbitrator` with the paremeter `address _arbitrator` set with the new arbitrator contract and the extra bytes data necessary to connect it to the Humanity Court with Court Id 1. \n- *HIP 49 Change the Arbitrator of the Proof of Humanity Governor*: The Proof of Humanity Governor (`0x327a29fcE0a6490E4236240Be176dAA282EcCfdF`) will execute `changeArbitrator` with the paremeter `address _arbitrator` set with the new arbitrator contract and the extra bytes data necessary to connect it to the Humanity Court with the Court Id 1. \n\nOnce these changes are in place, the Proof of Humanity DAO will effectively control the rules of its own Arbitrator and disputes on the Governor will be setlled by the Proof of Humanity Arbitrator contract.

There is a recent incident in which the proposers for HIPs on Snapshot was unilaterally deleted, against the advice from the other admin of the platform Santi Siri, because it was being done without proper consultation with the DAO. \n* This later issue, along with the creation of HIP-34 itself (which dramatically decreases open participation for proposals), created a situation that now requires two different and new HIPs to solve the issue.\n* An unsuccessful attempt to remove a valid admin from the Telegram group (for the record, I was the admin asked to be removed). \n* Disregarding serious security threats to the registering process ([metadata issue](https://github.com/Proof-Of-Humanity/proof-of-humanity-web/issues/295#event-4798667830)): When warned about this issue, Clement lowered the priority of a huge security threat in which personal georeferencing data was being leaked into the registry profiles. In a forum post he mentioned that having personal data leaked was [\"a nice thing to have\"](https://t.me/proofhumanity/28352)\n* Systematically obstaculizing any process that helps humans register (352, vouchallengers, etc) sometimes suggesting that challenges are good and vouch-and-challenge attacks are part of the normal mechanism:\n    * Example 1, stating against better explanation of proper vouching https://gov.proofofhumanity.id/t/incentivize-better-more-responsible-vouching/144/2\n    * Example 2, stating that the only way to keep deposits low is keeping the challenges high https://gov.proofofhumanity.id/t/challenges-and-removals-its-always-fair/251/10\n    * Example 3, falsely accusing of being \"undemocratic\" a democratic poll https://gov.proofofhumanity.id/t/hiring-product-manager/299/68 and this is **critical for someone holding veto power in snapshot**.\n    * Example 4, saying that it is [\"perfectly fine\"](https://gov.proofofhumanity.id/t/phase-1-hip-12-let-users-decide-to-accept-vouches-when-your-profile-is-in-vouching-phase/583/5) and having the opportunity to withdraw from a mistake is [a \"courtesy\" and not a right](https://gov.proofofhumanity.id/t/phase-1-hip-12-let-users-decide-to-accept-vouches-when-your-profile-is-in-vouching-phase/583/6).     \n* Following the previous point, making Proof of Humanity a dispute-creating machine. \n* Sabotaging or lack of respect to proper procedure\n    * [Arguing about voter fatigue in proposals](https://gov.proofofhumanity.id/search?q=voter%20fatigue%20%40clesaege) that he disagreed with, creating voter fatigue in [proposal cloning](https://gov.proofofhumanity.id/t/phase-2-hip-18-communication-roles/816) in order to match his own individual standards. \n* Under-specifying regulations so that he can later interpret the normative as he unilaterally thinks (basically all the hips he authored, including HIP-34)\n* Lack of proper spirit of collaboration with the community, evidenced by lack of participation in main groups.\n* Stalling the hiring process to the point that the actuall hiring was put in hibernation https://gov.proofofhumanity.id/t/hiring-product-manager/299. \n    * It is worth also noting the contradiction with other comments in which he stated that hiring should be done fast https://gov.proofofhumanity.id/t/hiring-developer/300/5 \n* Taking decisions in the background without proper consultation to DAO members, or disregarding alternative perspectives. \n* Not acknowledging the issues regarding the concentration and dominance of a priviledge few in the Kleros Humanity Court and not doing anything to prevent such an abnormal degree of centralization.\n\n# Rationale\nThis HIP was left on hold since its creation, but recent events regarding removal of dissenting members of the DAO from telegram channels have sparked the interest of the community to move forward with this proposal. \n\n# Implementation\nIf Phase 3 binding vote is approved, the position that Clement Lesaege is occupying as a Mission Board Member will become vacant. (for Phase 3 it could be debated if he can re-apply for the position in the next term).",

      "title": "[Phase-2] [Signalling] HIP-45: Rewrite Policy in Markdown instead of PDF",
      "content": "```\nHIP: 45\ntitle: Rewrite Policy in Markdown instead of PDF\nauthor: @greenlucid\nstatus: Phase 2\ncreated: 2022-06-23\nconflicts with: None\nlanguages: EN\n```\n\n## Simple Summary\n\nMigrate the policy from PDF to Markdown, and edit the policy in a repository.\n\n## Abstract\n\nPolicies should be written and edited in Markdown. This makes coordination easier and, in particular, speeds up policy editions, even more so when dealing with concurrent HIPs. A repository will be built under [Proof of Humanity GitHub](https://github.com/Proof-Of-Humanity/) for this purpose. \n\n## Motivation\n\nUsing pdf as the raw document for a policy is a coordination disaster. There is too much friction around making changes to the policy to integrate the HIPs that affect it. With a PDF, the latest working document must also be made available, which introduces delays. Also, to make this new quality of life explicit, a repository will be used to coordinate the changes. \n\n## Rationale\n\nThe format should be easy to edit, audit, and replicate. The format should make it easy to follow changes and notice mistakes, just like code repositories do. Code repositories are the state of the art solution to coordinate changes across technical files (*source code*), so it makes sense to also use a repository for a critical document such as the PoH registration policy.\n\nThe official [Proof of Humanity GitHub](https://github.com/Proof-Of-Humanity/) was chosen as a default option, but this HIP does not mandate it must be the only repository to use. Although, it is recommended to contribute all changes in the same repository, for clarity.\n\n## Implementation\n\nMake a repository for the express purpose of containing this policy, or other important files (such as the `MetaEvidence` jsons). This rewrite of the policy will be the starting basis for the repository:\n\n[poh-policy.md](https://github.com/greenlucid/poh-policy/blob/master/poh-policy.md) (feel free to make PRs to fix issues during this Phase 2)\n[Rendered sample](https://ipfs.kleros.io/ipfs/QmTbxCZQL28w6TFgJ6XBPqmBuw2eeNtR9T5u3tYJgEJhLt/Proof%20of%20Humanity%20Registry%20Policy.pdf) (this render is not particularly good)\n\nThe process to edit and champion HIPs that modify the policy should be the following:\n\n* The champion of the HIP forks the repository containing the policy.\n* The champion creates a draft Pull Request to the base repository with the name of the HIP and a link to the HIP in the description.\n* The champion writes the changes to the policy, and asks for reviews and feedback. This can be done during Phase 1 or Phase 2.\n* After the feedback process, the PR stops being a Draft and no further changes are allowed. The HIP then gets to Phase 3.\n* If the HIP passes, the PR is merged.\n\n---\n\n## Addendum - FAQ\n\n### Who are “the reviewers”?\n\nThis is purposely under-specified. It could just be voluntaries or enthusiasts, but there’s no explicit need for them to be authority figures, or Mission Board members. My suggestion is that a few eyes that don’t agree with the HIP should also take a look.\n\n### Isn’t this complicated for non-technical contributors?\n\nIt’s certainly not harder than what we currently have. But, if this was the case, I will write a short guide on how to join a repository and follow the steps for non-technical people to champion or contribute to HIPs.\n\n### Won’t it be ugly for the users to show a raw text file?\n\nThis HIP does not set into stone that the raw markdown file must be the policy provided in the `MetaEvidence`. But, it is possible to use a browser extension to render markdown dynamically. [This is such an example](https://github.com/KeithLRobertson/markdown-viewer).\n\nIt is also possible to use an app such as [md2pdf](https://md2pdf.netlify.app/) to render the markdown as a pdf file, and then include that file in the `MetaEvidence`. But this creates an extra step that should be scrutinized.\n\n### Where is the markdown policy kept?\n\nIt doesn’t matter if it’s published as a raw markdown or published as pdf, it should be kept in a repository in any case, to allow following the process indicated in the *implementation* header.\nAs for the specific question of, in which repository, I would suggest to use the [official Proof of Humanity GitHub repository ](https://github.com/Proof-Of-Humanity/).",

      "content": "># HIP 42 \n>## Allow Spanish Phrase/ Permitir Frase en Castellano/Español\n> **Authors: Lety (Laura Leticia Lopez), nicobilinkis.eth**\n>  status:  Fase 3 \n> _Created: 2022/05/30_\n> [Gov forum discussion](https://gov.proofofhumanity.id/t/phase-3-binding-hip-42-allow-spanish-phrase/2096)\n\n## Abstract / Resumen \n\nPoH registrants, or those who renew their registration, will be allowed to say the phrase that is required to register in Spanish at the time of recording their video. Those who choose to do it in Spanish will not need to record a video in English. All subsequent validation that is required must be in Spanish if it was the language utilized in the video.\n## Motivation / Motivación\n\n- Proof of Humanity and the Universal Basic Income emphasizes that income should be a right that is universal for all people disregarding their origin or status. This universality concept could be expanded to the other aspects of the platform. Although being a de facto language spoken in large parts of developed societies and persons that have access and resources to afford quality language education, English is not the language with the most native speakers. Users should have an alternative option to English. This would solve the current limitation of not including peoples native languages and it would remove this need.\n\nA total of 580 million people speak Spanish worldwide, 7.6% of the world's population. Of these, 483 million - three million more than a year ago - are native Spanish speakers, making Spanish the second most spoken mother tongue in the world by number of speakers (Source: www.cervantes.es).\n\nRight now the Spanish PoH community is not only very agile but has a larger number of active humans on their networks than the English community. We believe that giving it the space it deserves is important to expand, even more, the growth of our PoH community. In the week of May 22-29, 2022, while the first vote was held to elect the new Mission Board Members, the Proof of Humanity Spanish Telegram group had 79% of the total activity of the groups, while 19% was occupied by the English group, and the rest by the Italian, German, Catalan and Russian speaking groups. It is also important to mention that of the eight applicants, five are native Spanish speakers.\n\nWe consider that community activity is highly important as self-regulation, which implies that there are people within the Spanish-speaking community who are trained and currently making challenge requests to keep the registry curated.  \n\n- We also believe it is essential that registrants know exactly what they are saying when they are registering, and in this way prevent pronunciation errors of native Spanish speakers. \n\n- On the other hand, and from a more philosophical aspect, which again focuses on what it means to cover needs, we can also understand that the adoption of the languages of active communities has to do with covering all aspects of the pyramid of human needs proposed in the psychological theory of Abraham Maslow, and also to put into practice what the detractors of this theory claim, which is the theory of Human Scale Development, in which Max-Neef, Elizalde and Hopenhayn proposed a radical change in the way of understanding development, which at that time was assimilated with economic growth, as opposed to this vision, they proposed a development based on a human scale.\nIn the face of this vision, they proposed a development based on people and the improvement of their quality of life. Understanding the complexity of these theories and seeking a balance between them would turn the entire Proof of Humanity community into an overcoming instance, combining the aspects of both theories since they are taken into account from the very foundations of the project (which are the ones we are building every time we make a Hip that allows us to improve and expand the protocol) that allows us to, We hope that this will be replicated, generating active participation and better opportunities for access to the registry without losing sight of its curation, which implies, precisely, a very active participation of the native speakers of each language that is incorporated.\n\n- At the moment the comparison of records using voice biometric data is not used within Proof of Humanity, however, we know that it is possible that it will be applied in the future. Therefore, and in response to the request for security reinforcement requested by people in the community, we investigated the following: the development of the open source algorithms that exist so far still confuse similar voices in the same language (in the case of the algorithms that unlock the cell phones we use every day there is, in fact, a warning explaining that anyone with a voice frequency similar to ours can unlock our device if we use only that security measure). However they are able to recognize similar voice frequencies in different languages without problems: we can test it by speaking to our device in other languages. Private voice recognition algorithms, which are already being used in some banks (such as BBVA with company Veridas. Source: https://veridas.com/autenticacion-con-voz/) as an additional security measure, can isolate unique frequencies to be used for personal identification, and is performed independently of text and language. To summarize the point: in case it is necessary to use this technology in the future, we will surely be able to access or develop, which would be even more interesting, as a community, a recognition algorithm that isolates the frequency of the voice in search of uniqueness without text or language requirements, so it is not an impediment today or in the future that each person uses his native language to make the video that requires registration. \n- We also know that there are many followers of the phrase \"If it ain't broke, don't fix it\", popularized in English by Bert Lance, an American civil servant, during Jimmy Carter's administration. The underlying belief in that phrase was that when things work \"right\" they don't need money or effort to be changed. But that was in the past. Right now, unless your business is a monopoly, an oligopoly or you want your business to live in the past - for a short period of time, for sure - you are not expected to change. So change is something you have to believe in, embrace it and make it happen. What you do well now, you can certainly do better and improve. And this applies to technology in Web3, you expect the process and your experience to work, from start to the end, and you look for much more every day, among those things, recognition of what each community brings to the table. The lower the friction in an interaction, the greater the chances that the experience will be better. This is what Business Transformation of a new decentralized on-chain era is all about, waking up and fixing what is not yet broken.\n\n## Implementation / Implementación \n \nThe primary document must be modified adding the following paragraph:  \n \n“Only native spanish speakers should say the phrase: \"Certifico que soy una persona humana real y que no estoy actualmente en este registro\". If other words or extra validation phrases are required, they must be said in Spanish as well. Casual omission of words of the phrase, or accents are not grounds for removals or challenges and rejections. Mispronunciations of the words in that phrase are. Submitters should speak in their normal voice and should not attempt mimicking someone else’s voice. Speaking before or after the required sentence is acceptable.” \n\n## Specification / Especificación\n\nNative Spanish speakers who choose to make the video in Spanish may do so by saying the phrase: **\"Certifico que soy una persona humana real y que no estoy actualmente en este registro\".** (It is the direct, non gendered, translation of the current phrase)\nIf other words or extra validation phrases are required or used, they should also be pronounced in Spanish.\nHumans who are not native Spanish speakers should choose the English language, not Spanish, because it's not going to be allowed mispronunciation. Clarification: That is the reason why the Spanish phrase is only recommended for native speakers, it will not be anyone's task to determine whether or not the people are native speakers but that the requested phrase is pronounced without any mispronuntiations.\n## Rationale / Justificación\n\nThis Hip was made to meet the constant request of the Spanish Speakers community that requested on countless occasions that the registration could be in their native language (the first request in the community telegram group dates back to March 2021). \nThe reason why this particular phrase in Spanish was chosen (i.e. choosing “I am a real human person” instead of “I am a real human being”) is because words in Spanish are gendered, which is why it cannot be translated directly since there could be people within the community who do not feel comfortable with a binary expression. We believe that such a phrase would therefore be appropriate.\n\n## Special Thanks / Agradecimientos Especiales\n\nIn the first place we want to thank all the Proof of Humanity Telegram Community in Spanish, since this idea came from there and we´re just capturing it here.\nAnd a Special Thanks to the admins and collaborators that support us every day in this great community! \nAnd at last but least to **Ludoviko.eth, Mathaius.eth, V4len.eth, @MoniK74, @Onediss and Lufo** for their invaluable contribution.\n\n",

Those who choose to do it in Spanish will not need to record a video in English. All subsequent validation that is required must be in Spanish if it was the selected language.\n\n\nSe permitirá que quienes ingresan a PoH, o quienes renueven su registro, al momento de grabar su video digan la frase que se requiere para registrarse en español. Quienes elijan hacerlo en español no necesitarán grabar un video en Inglés. Toda validación posterior que se requiera deberá ser en español si fue el idioma seleccionado. \n\n\n## Motivation / Motivación\n\n Right now the Spanish PoH community is not only very active but has a larger number of active humans on their networks than the English community; so we believe that giving it the space it deserves is important for the growth of our community. We also consider it essential that entrants know exactly what they are saying when they are registering. And this way, make the pronunciation errors of native Spanish speakers almost none when they make the video.\n \n En este momento la comunidad de PoH en español es, no solo muy activa, sino que cuenta con una cantidad mayor de personas humanas activas en sus redes que la comunidad en inglés; por lo que creemos que darle el espacio que merece es importante para el crecimiento de nuestra comunidad. Así como también consideramos que es primordial que las personas ingresantes sepan con exactitud lo que están diciendo al momento de registrarse. Y de esta manera hacer que los errores de pronunciación las personas hispanohablantes nativas al realizar el video sean casi nulos. \n\n## Specification / Especificación\n\nNative Spanish speakers who choose to make the video in Spanish may do so by saying the phrase: **\"Certifico que soy una persona humana real y que no estoy actualmente en este registro\".**\nIf other words or extra validation phrases are required or used, they should also be pronounced in Spanish.\nHumans who are not native Spanish speakers should choose the English language, not Spanish.\n\nLas personas hispanohablantes nativas que decidan realizar el video en español podrán hacerlo diciendo la frase: **\"Certifico que soy una persona humana real y que no estoy actualmente en este registro\".**\nEn caso de requerirse o utilizarse otras palabras o frases de validación extra deben también ser pronunciadas en español. \nLas personas humanas que no sean hispanohablantes nativas deberían elegir el idioma inglés, no el español. \n\n## Rationale / Razones\n\nThis HIP was made to meet the constant requests from the Spanish speaking community that wanted the registration to be in their native language.\nThe reason why this phrase was chosen is because in Spanish words have a gender unlike the phrase in English, which is why it cannot be translated directly since there could be people within the community who do not feel comfortable with a binary expression. We believe that such a phrase would therefore be appropriate.\n\nEsta HIP se pensó en respuesta al pedido constante de la comunidad hispanohablante que solicitó en incontables oportunidades que el registro pudiera ser en su idioma nativo. \nEl motivo por el cual se eligió esa frase es porque en castellano las palabras tienen género a diferencia de la frase en inglés, razón por la cual no puede ser traducida de manera directa ya que podrían existir personas dentro de la comunidad que no se sintieran cómodas con una expresión binaria. Consideramos que esa frase sería, por lo tanto, adecuada. \n\n## Special Thanks / Agradecimientos Especiales\n\nFirst, we want to thanks all the Proof of Humanity Telegram Community in Spanish. \nAnd a Special Thanks to the admins and collaborators that support us every day in this great community! \nAnd last but not least, to **Ludoviko.eth, Mathaius.eth, V4len.eth, @MoniK74 and @Onediss** for their invaluable contribution.\n\nEn primer lugar queremos agradecer a toda la Comunidad de Telegram de Proof of Humanity en español.\n¡Y un agradecimiento especial a las administradoras y administradores, a cada persona voluntaria, que día a día nos apoyan en esta gran comunidad!\nY por último, pero no menos importante, a **Ludoviko.eth, Mathaius.eth, V4len.eth, @MoniK74 y a @Onediss** por su invaluable aporte. \n",

      "content": ">HIP 41\n>Title: Allow verbal confirmation for registrating users\n>authors: avsa.eth and nicobilinkis.eth\n>Status: Phase 3\n>Created: 2022-28-3\n\n[Gov forum post](https://gov.proofofhumanity.id/t/phase-3-binding-hip-41-allow-verbal-confirmation-for-registrating-users/1975)\n\n# Simple Summary\nThis would add the option to have a user, instead of holding a sign with their address, give a verbal confirmation of their public address. Either visual or verbal confirmation would be accepted.\n\n\n# Abstract\nThe user, when onboarding, should be able to decide either to make a visual or verbal confirmation (or both) of their public address during their video. \n\nThe current rules for profile submission require a mandatory sign (can be a screen) showing the full Ethereum address. This has been a point of failure for many people. Although many efforts where made to help resolve those problems, such as HIP-27 allowing for one character mistakes, the sign itself is just one more step to fight deep-fakes. \nConsidering all those facts, we believe that it's feasible to replace that sign with a verbal confirmation. Instead of showing a sign with the ETH address the submitter would have to say out loud **8 words** that confirm ownership of both address and media files.\n\n# Motivation\nThe advantages are clear:\n\n* Easier flow, as the user can do all the process in one take in the video by following simple instructions on screen\n* No props needed: Human doesn’t need to fish around to get a pen and a paper or find a second screen, nor spend a long time trying to slowly copy the address.\n* More accessible: For people with movement or vision impairment, this would make it easier for them to be included in the system\n* DOESN’T EXCLUDE SIGNS: users who still prefer to hold signs (maybe someone who is speech impaired, or just shy) can still use visual confirmation of their address.\n\n# Implementation\n\n## Changes to the primary document\nModify section 4 of the primary document to the following:\n> 4. Video of the submitter - Required\n> * **The user can choose to display his Ethereum address using a physical sign. \nThe sign has to display in a readable manner the full Ethereum address of the\nsubmitter (No ENS; no ellipsis). The sign can be a screen. The submitter must\nshow the sign in the right orientation to be read on the video.**\n    A single one of the following errors occurring once will be tolerated in the displayed address:\n    - omitted character: a character is omitted from the address (e.g. “abcd” →\n    “abd”).\n    - mistaken character: a different character has been written in place of the\n    one expected in that position (e.g. “abcd” → “ab9d”).\n    - swapped adjacent characters: two characters adjacent to each other have\n    been swapped (e.g. “abcd” → “acbd”, but not “adcb”).\n    - additional character: an additional character has been inserted anywhere\n    in the address (e.g. “abcd” → “abc0d”).\n\n> * **The user can choose to use verbal confirmation. The user has to say the 8 words that are shown on the screen when recording their video. These words are the result of turning the submitter's Ethereum address into base 2048 and then matching these with the BIP-039 dictionary of the same language that the user is using for the rest of the phrase.

      "content": ">HIP 41\n>Title: Allow verbal confirmation for registrating users\n>authors: avsa.eth and nicobilinkis.eth\n>Status: Phase 2\n>Created: 2022-28-3\n>URL:https://gov.proofofhumanity.id/t/phase-2-hip-41-allow-verbal-confirmation-for-registrating-users/1888\n\n## Simple Summary\n\nThis would add the option to have a user, instead of holding a sign with their address, give a verbal confirmation of their public address. Either visual or verbal confirmation would be accepted.\n\n## Abstract\n\n\nThe user, when onboarding, should be able to decide either to make a visual or verbal confirmation (or both) of their public address during their video. \n\nThe current rules for profile submission require a mandatory sign (can be a screen) showing the full Ethereum address. This has been a point of failure for many people. Although many efforts where made to help resolve those problems, such as HIP-27 allowing for one character mistakes, the sign itself is just one more step to fight deep-fakes. Considering all those facts, we believe that it's feasible to replace that sign with a verbal confirmation. Instead of showing a sign with the ETH address the submitter would have to say out loud a series of words that confirm ownership of both address and media files.\n\n## Motivation\n\nThe advantages are clear:\n\nEasier flow, as the user can do all the process in one take in the video by following simple instructions on screen\nNo props needed. Human doesn’t need to fish around to get a pen and a paper or find a second screen, nor spend a long time trying to slowly copy the address.\nMore accessible. For people with movement or vision impairment, this would make it easier for them to be included in the system\nDOESN’T EXCLUDE SIGNS: users who still prefer to hold signs (maybe someone who is speech impaired, or just shy) can still use visual confirmation of their address.\n\n## Implementation\n\n\n**BIP 039 words**\n\nThe user must look at the camera and say (in one of the officially acepted languages): \n\"I certify that I am a real human and that I am not already in this registry. My identifier is \"\n\nFollowing by an identifier which is obtained by converting the hexadecimal ethereum address into base 2048, then converting those digits into [the official BIP039 dictionary words](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0039/bip-0039-wordlists.md). The user then must speak the **first 6 resulting words in the same same language as the phrase**.\n> \n> Example:\n> The address **0x17a91203a9e9c3519c2f76210497ef7f4be2352f**\n> Would be spoken as: **Able Barrel, Debris Siege, Pretty Inquiry.** (commas and spacing are optional)\n\nThe phrase derived from the address would be generated **automatically** in the **DAPP UI**. Also it would be shown on every profile that chose this verification method, so that validators can still curate the list as usual. \n\nThe BIP039 dictionary **MUST** be in the same language as the rest of the phrase, so when a future HIP approves a new language, this HIP will not need to be updated. If a future HIP approves a new official Proof of Humanity language that does not have an official BIP039 dictionary yet, then the HIP that adds the new language must also define an official word dictionary for the purposes of this HIP.\n",

Candidates must be solicited on all official channels.\n\n### Motivation\n\nSoon most of the mission board posts will expire (June 5th). At that time we should have a robust procedure to elect new ones.\n\n### Implementation\n\n* When a mandate for an official PoH position expires within 3 months any member may open an election thread to find a replacement. The member opening this thread will be called the election moderator.\n* The election moderator cannot hold or be up for the election of any official post from the time of the creation of the official thread until the termination of the election.\n* If several positions expire within 3 months of the same type at the opening of the thread, then the thread must cover the election of all positions of the same type.\n* Candidates must be solicited on all “Community-managed” (see HIP-16) channels and at least one month must be allowed for finding candidates and the deadline must be clearly communicated in the official thread.\n* All candidates must declare their intention to run in the official thread.\n* The election moderator can within one week of the declaration deadline open an approval voting vote on Snapshot, where the candidate(s) with the most votes will be chosen for the available positions.\n\nSpecific rules for the “Mission board”\n\n* “Mission Board” members whose post is up for re-election cannot moderate the rules for an election for the “Mission Board” itself. Such members will also be excluded from board votes on the topic of the election.\n* If the election moderator fails to uphold the requirements, non-excluded members of the “Mission Board” can appoint a new election moderator. This decision must be justified by the board member, pointing to specific violations of this HIP of the self-appointed election moderator.",

Candidates must be solicited on all official channels.\n\nMotivation\nSoon most of the mission board posts will expire (June 5th). At that time we should have a robust procedure to elect new ones.\n\nImplementation\n* When a mandate for an official PoH position expires within 3 months any member may open an election thread to find a replacement. The member opening this thread will be called the election moderator.\n* The election moderator cannot hold or be up for the election of any official post from the time of the creation of the official thread until the termination of the election.\n* If several positions expire within 3 months of the same type at the opening of the thread, then the thread must cover the election of all positions of the same type.\n* Candidates must be solicited on all “Community-managed” (see HIP-16) channels and at least one month must be allowed for finding candidates and the deadline must be clearly communicated in the official thread.\n* All candidates must declare their intention to run in the official thread.\n* The election moderator can within one week of the declaration deadline open an approval voting vote on Snapshot, where the candidate(s) with the most votes will be chosen for the available positions.\n\nSpecific rules for the “Mission board”\n* “Mission Board” members whose post is up for re-election cannot moderate the rules for an election for the “Mission Board” itself. Such members will also be excluded from board votes on the topic of the election.\n* If the election moderator fails to uphold the requirements, non-excluded members of the “Mission Board” can appoint a new election moderator.",

A poll made on Snapshot was used to gather a list of addresses of people interested in having that role.\n\n## Motivation\n\nOriginal and deleted proposal was in this link: [Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/poh.eth/proposal/0x32a19b0132c8e2e6c19bf3cd74138416f9a5f780e672a58982d00cbd827813f9). This is the IPFS link for the proposal (that does not contain the votes): https://ipfs.fleek.co/ipfs/QmbDBvUJNhyaWUu1nhGPSEpuCxqhWP9hwC2FdQuJNM1tVY\n\nAs an alternative, this is the IPFS of signed votes for proposers: https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmYwumh4oS8N6iUvqEEhsJZkaN2DY7dfkcvrNRttzAoUTP?filename=ipfs_signed_proposors.txt. This list was provided by Laurent Genoud, developer and admin of the official Snapshot Telegram group ([Telegram: Contact @snapshotlabs](https://t.me/snapshotlabs/7972)).\n\nThe poll was used in order to guarantee that proposers belonged to the registry. There was only one option “I offer myself as Proposer”. This document [Votes poh.eth WITH LINK - Google Sheets ](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vsIaSvo6ee4A9HBNpG3QALE-YlDXYM6yjlskvavwsCo/edit?usp=sharing) has the IPFS links which show which people voted that option, so they voted in clear knowledge that they offered themselves as proposers.\n\n## Implementation\n\nUse the addresses on the list below to grant them the ability to post proposals in the PoH Snapshot pages.

      "title": "[Phase3][Binding]HIP-36: Registration Validity Extension and Change of Renewal Period",
      "content": "> HIP: 36\n> title: Registration Validity Extension and Change of Renewal Period\n> author: @senryu @NingFid @fnanni \n> status: Phase 3\n> created: 2022-02-01\n\n\n\n**Simple Summary**\n\nThe validity of a registered profile is 1 year. This proposal aims to extend the duration of each profile to 2 years and change the renewal period duration to 3 months.\n\n**Abstract**\n\nTo prevent high attrition in the registry due to renewal cost and simultaneous $UBI sell-off to fund renewal, we propose a change on the validity of the registered profiles through a change of the parameter `submissionDuration` to 2 years.\n\nMoreover, the current setup to remove registered profiles is halted for the entire renewal duration of 6 months which is too long of ‘immunity’ period for possibly missed non-conforming and/or suspicious profiles. Another issue that was brought up is for those who wish to be removed but cannot initiate it(no option)until the 6-month renewal period is over. This can be done through a parameter change of of `renewalPeriodDuration` to 3 months.\n\n**Motivation**\n\nIn order for the Proof of Humanity protocol to maintain the momentum in registration and remain as the largest on-chain identity system, we need to address the pain points in submission primarily the total cost to register and renew.\n\nWhile the ETH usd value halved since [Phase 1](https://gov.proofofhumanity.id/t/phase-1-hip-36-extending-the-registration-period-to-avoid-gas-costs/1538/4), ETH price forecast remains positive in the long term due to Ethereum’s widespread use (https://cryptofees.info/; https://money-movers.info/; ) and net issuance (https://watchtheburn.com/insights) relatively lower than the burned ETH from fees as of today. Might sound more speculative than concrete motivation to push this proposal through, but the Proof of Humanity registration being denominated in ETH is significantly affected by price changes.\n\nMoreover, there are few other preceding profile submission requirement alterations being proposed [HIP-32](https://gov.proofofhumanity.id/t/phase-2-hip-32-define-text-to-be-read-for-profile-renewal/1157),   [HIP 33](https://gov.proofofhumanity.id/t/phase-1-hip-33-registry-protection-against-puppet-and-farming-attacks/1357/2),  [HIP 27](https://gov.proofofhumanity.id/t/phase-2-hip-27-allow-1-character-mistakes-in-displayed-address-updated/1275) that are yet to be implemented and may be enforced at the same time as many profiles need renewing. We need more time to re-educate users and curators of the new process as we strive to balance fair incentivization and high-quality curated sybil-proof list of humans.\n\n**Specification**\n\nThe proposed parameter changes on submissionDuration and renewalPeriodDuration will affect profiles:\n\n* About to expire after 1 year in the registry\n* Have renewed prior to the change and will have the new validity as specified in the change\n* Current registrants not in renewal period\n* Incoming submissions\n\n**Implementation**\n\nA transaction with the following specifications is expected to be executed from the Proof of Humanity governor:\n\n* Contract address: 0xC5E9dDebb09Cd64DfaCab4011A0D5cEDaf7c9BDb.\n* Function: changeDurations(uint64 _submissionDuration, uint64 _renewalPeriodDuration, uint64 _challengePeriodDuration).\n* Function parameters:\n– `_submissionDuration`: 63115200 (twice the current value, i.e. 2 years).\n– `_renewalPeriodDuration`: 7889400 (half of the current value, i.e. 3 months).\n– `_challengePeriodDuration`: 302400 (stays the same).\n* Value to be sent: 0 ETH.",

A poll made on Snapshot was used to gather a list of addresses of people interested in having that role.\n\n## Motivation\n\nOriginal and deleted proposal was in this link: [Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/poh.eth/proposal/0x32a19b0132c8e2e6c19bf3cd74138416f9a5f780e672a58982d00cbd827813f9). This is the IPFS link for the proposal (that does not contain the votes): https://ipfs.fleek.co/ipfs/QmbDBvUJNhyaWUu1nhGPSEpuCxqhWP9hwC2FdQuJNM1tVY\n\nAs an alternative, this is the IPFS of signed votes for proposers: https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmYwumh4oS8N6iUvqEEhsJZkaN2DY7dfkcvrNRttzAoUTP?filename=ipfs_signed_proposors.txt. This list was provided by Laurent Genoud, developer and admin of the official Snapshot Telegram group ([Telegram: Contact @snapshotlabs](https://t.me/snapshotlabs/7972)).\n\nThe poll was used in order to guarantee that proposers belonged to the registry. There was only one option “I offer myself as Proposer”. This document [Votes poh.eth WITH LINK - Google Sheets ](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vsIaSvo6ee4A9HBNpG3QALE-YlDXYM6yjlskvavwsCo/edit?usp=sharing) has the IPFS links which show which people voted that option, so they voted in clear knowledge that they offered themselves as proposers.\n\n## Implementation\n\nUse the addresses on the list below to grant them the ability to post proposals in the PoH Snapshot pages. (IPFS copy: [https://ipfs.io/ipfs/Qmf8Nwezy1gpbtctdHtFPPJFezT6euFcCu5QFUrQYYVu3C?filename=proposoooooooooooooooors.txt](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/Qmf8Nwezy1gpbtctdHtFPPJFezT6euFcCu5QFUrQYYVu3C?filename=proposoooooooooooooooors.txt) )\n\nList:\n\n    0x3BE28A28B85c36FB74e513898bC11260Ee541AAC\n    0xDA35c8e464889bA2Cb91d2E85C608a99D262d5db\n    bobjiang.eth\n    0xbeeb01a1E47450479c99b7Eb545D090cDdD78776\n    0x9d9E26932d012b2Ab21B974fE1552F4025b1e1Cc\n    poweroverwhelming.eth\n    18183.eth\n    0x6Ed3755141cecB387FCB2Ad18b537bc7F2bD524b\n    0xkafo.eth\n    0x31452B884F5269eD21e2BAB44CC6A9d48eAac85f\n    0x6E9A88971e957Abb41bAe4E2677caE258F0c1e76\n    zrowgz.eth\n    bosco.eth\n    0xe724C1D534284f2837F3ab310eF8329BBD7c045E\n    0xae55D42e157E35a075BA38De7E871178648D2d30\n    0x342f5be7578CA67506a31214D93a99e5504256CC\n    0x5886f65425cad457776d7a89a399907c97e608e5\n    0x85c2043C36be1b84A789E92c29ee3e918ddF50f4\n    0x275203A89ACEEdee0D07aF626830baE536b36eD1\n    erik.bjareholt.eth\n    0xcBCA1f03D67472A7bEe257798Fc93c7eC6c5BE77\n    0x96925d8E33AE06F6fC9F185F106C6F026d36B352\n    0xBfF6800aF73a36a7b1821Cc9f18DB00cA4Aa4b3d\n    0xb0CC32190a06f4bA13027E7D6C516217b49E8eb0\n    0xe17aE4Ee9f37524d2a25177C8a6C95e51DD85262\n    0x6bFadF56F24583A777020F6B6EEb11591D79270c\n    0xcdf2bc5eAE545953A840457eCDCd5a5Bd4466f66\n    0xb8F6b7dfCA935D1aDB58ab18177F5B72a939Ba70\n    0x87EE3c1Fb15eae5b9965493C2020dbd3AdACdAfA\n    0x87EE3c1Fb15eae5b9965493C2020dbd3AdACdAfA\n    0xcb68A8138c1e57691574670f435A36dB5eCC8E2a\n    0x39Df2B98daDA52248309770B530c2D2ED0908Cd3\n    0x670F6eFC8DBA20BBb1BF49bad31845e47216BFF9\n    0x6c97785edAf8f949a353fcc1629d48759B12F323\n    0x6c97785edAf8f949a353fcc1629d48759B12F323\n    0xc0086412BA221bd43e69852c9eA38336D6310885\n    0xe17aE4Ee9f37524d2a25177C8a6C95e51DD85262\n    0x7b694B2a461E58b0673565fB8B1D83E962Ed70f3\n    dacastillo.eth\n    charles53300.sismo.eth\n    0xC17671afEc156398D65ffCBD37ea2B3C12225684\n    0xC17671afEc156398D65ffCBD37ea2B3C12225684\n    shotaro.eth\n    0xA72ef9BB82d59464eAA63f461C273f8028b20f5c\n    0xa697c106f153ba7Fa3801bA2afd6273559c7b105\n    0x6E9A88971e957Abb41bAe4E2677caE258F0c1e76\n    0x6E9A88971e957Abb41bAe4E2677caE258F0c1e76\n    0x364144a07f23EF285DF585D3E4239Ca7B1102535\n    0xcd3c6214dd023eEA574410FfF03d3c065dc560F3\n    nicobilinkis.eth\n    0xE30827AE68533e7a01Fb8369d5219f18D5f70e87\n    0x3BE28A28B85c36FB74e513898bC11260Ee541AAC\n    matiasben.eth\n    jfdominguez.eth\n    0x8BF7Cd4aE85F765a06006802e21bbCC968f45421\n    0x14f284988198bBD305C44b7BEA8748323fBB8419\n    0x0827ED3a46c9793005e4D68E838DE577Cd8DD752\n    0xb3ca2de6af06BF736c609F3e4dD1307570a37732\n    0xb3ca2de6af06BF736c609F3e4dD1307570a37732\n    0x5CfA0c362DADEa86478d05767ed800dd1B026749\n    0x26D06ec9a2dd19cb33398a58f75d9Aa61dda11cD\n    v4len.eth\n    0x61E067aF897a0a9130e5Fbb9bF089223FCa10820\n    0x6F772F596bB0e9e534Ac99D782eE36578dd15B14\n    drlorente97.eth\n    ludoviko.eth\n    0xmanu.eth\n    juanu.eth\n    0xjean.eth",

This proposal aims to extend the duration of each profile to 2 years and change the renewal period duration to 3 months.\n \nAbstract\n\nTo prevent high attrition in the registry due to renewal cost and simultaneous $UBI sell-off to fund renewal, we propose a change on the validity of the registered profiles through a change of the parameter submissionDuration to 2 years. \nMoreover, the current setup to remove registered profiles is halted for the entire renewal duration of 6 months which is too long of ‘immunity’ period for possibly missed non-conforming and/or suspicious profiles. Another issue that was brought up is for those who wish to be removed but cannot initiate it(no option)until the 6-month renewal period is over. This can be done through a parameter change of renewalPeriodDuration to 3 months.\n \n \nMotivation\n\nIn order for the Proof of Humanity protocol to maintain the momentum in registration and remain as the largest on-chain identity system, we need to address the pain points in submission primarily the total cost to register and renew. \n \nWhile the ETH usd value halved since Phase 1, ETH price forecast remains positive in the long term due to Ethereum’s widespread use (https://cryptofees.info/; https://money-movers.info/; ) and net issuance (https://watchtheburn.com/insights) relatively lower than the burned ETH from fees as of today. Might sound more speculative than concrete motivation to push this proposal through, but the Proof of Humanity registration being denominated in ETH is significantly affected by price changes.\n\nMoreover, there are few other preceding profile submission requirement alterations being proposed HIP-32 https://gov.proofofhumanity.id/t/phase-2-hip-32-define-text-to-be-read-for-profile-renewal/1157 HIP 33 https://gov.proofofhumanity.id/t/phase-1-hip-33-registry-protection-against-puppet-and-farming-attacks/1357/2\nHIP 27 https://gov.proofofhumanity.id/t/phase-2-hip-27-allow-1-character-mistakes-in-displayed-address-updated/1275\nthat are yet to be implemented and may be enforced at the same time as many profiles need renewing. We need more time to re-educate users and curators of the new process as we strive to balance fair incentivization and high-quality curated sybil-proof list of humans.\n \nSpecification\n\nThe proposed parameter changes on submissionDuration and renewalPeriodDuration will affect profiles:\n- About to expire after 1 year in the registry\n- Have renewed prior to the change and will have the new validity as specified in the change\n- Current registrants not in renewal period\n- Incoming submissions\n \nDiscussions found in the threads:\nhttps://gov.proofofhumanity.id/t/extending-the-registration-period-with-one-year/1316?u=ningfid\nhttps://gov.proofofhumanity.id/t/phase-1-hip-36-extending-the-registration-period-to-avoid-gas-costs/1538?u=ningfid\n ",

      "content": "# [Phase 3] - HIP 27: Allow 1-character mistakes in displayed addresses\n\nhttps://gov.proofofhumanity.id/t/phase-2-hip-27-allow-1-character-mistakes-in-displayed-address-updated/1275\n\n```\nHIP: 27\ntitle: Allow 1-character mistakes in displayed addresses\nauthor: @Mizu @juanu\nstatus: Phase 2\ncreated: 20\n```\n## Simple Summary\nThis proposal would modify the registry policy to allow for limited mistakes or omissions in the address displayed in a profile’s video.\n\n## Abstract\nMany profiles get challenged due to mistakes affecting a single character in the address displayed by the submitter in their video. This proposal would make it so a single such mistake would no longer be grounds for rejection. This would not reduce the security of the profile or the PoH registry in any practical terms as will be demonstrated below.\nMotivation\n\nSubmitters will often write down their address by hand instead of printing it or displaying it on another screen. This might be because they don’t have a printer or another device with a screen they can easily display it on, or simply because they find writing the address by hand to be more convenient at that time.\n\nAs one might expect, it is often the case that submitters make mistakes when copying their address. Sometimes, these are significant errors such as the omission of a large part of the address, in which case it might be possible for an attacker to generate matching addresses, but often the error will affect only one character. We may distinguish 4 types of errors:\n\n```\n- omitted character: a character is omitted from the address (e.g. “abcd” → “abd”)\n- mistaken character: a different character has been written in place of the one expected in that position (e.g. “abcd” → “ab9d”)\n- swapped adjacent characters: two characters adjacent to each other have been swapped (e.g. “abcd” → “acbd”)\n- additional character: an additional character has been inserted anywhere in the address (e.g. “abcd” → “abc0d”)\n```\n\nThis proposal would allow at most one of the above three errors in a displayed address. The effects on the security of an address (i.e. on the ability of an attacker to find a private key generating an address which would match the displayed address) would be the following:\n\n```\n- omitted character: 9.32 bits: lg(40*16): 40 positions to insert the missing character which has 16 possible values\n- mistaken character: 9.23 bits: lg(40*15): 40 characters with 15 possible invalid values each\n- swapped adjacent characters: 5.29 bits: lg(39): 39 possible swaps of adjacent characters, although note that this can be slightly lower still since not all swaps have an effect (e.g. in “abbd”, swapping the two \"b\"s has no effect)\n- additional character: 5.36 bits: lg(41): 41 choices for which character to delete\n```\n\nNote that if a character is missing (case 1.) the three other cases are no longer allowed, and conversely, if the displayed address has all 40 characters (case 2. and 3.), the first and fourth cases are no longer allowed, and if there is an extra character, then only case 4. may be considered. As a result the maximum security loss is max(lg(N_1), lg(N_2 + N_3), lg(N_4)) = max(9.32, 9.32, 5.36) = 9.32 bits, reducing the total security of an address from 160 to 150.68 bits. Given the low stakes involved in being able to create a fake profile with an existing PoH registration video and the fact that no one is likely to be able to crack 150 bits of an Ethereum key for the foreseeable future, this should be an acceptable security compromise.\n\nAt this point, it is worth noting that there is one disadvantage to this proposal: It will no longer be possible to find a person’s profile from the video alone without trying all possible allowed errors, which is to say 639 trials in the worst case. This is easily remedied with a simple software loop, but something to keep in mind.\n\n## Specification\nThe following text will be appended at the end of the first bullet point of subsection 4. of the “List of current required/optional elements and submission rules”:\n```\nA single one of the following errors occurring once will be tolerated in the displayed address:\n- omitted character: a character is omitted from the address (e.g. “abcd” → “abd”)\n- mistaken character: a different character has been written in place of the one expected in that position (e.g. “abcd” → “ab9d”)\n- swapped adjacent characters: two characters adjacent to each other have been swapped (e.g. “abcd” → “acbd”, but not “adcb”)\n- additional character: an additional character has been inserted anywhere in the address (e.g. “abcd” → “abc0d”)\n```\n\nAs stated on the effects on security, 1 character does not add a great impact on security, but it does greatly impact on UX and humans registering making honest mistakes. \nIt could be argued that in a future time, we could be allowing more characters mistakes, which would lead to a slippery slope. The key point is to maintain security and adding more characters would have a greater impact on security. 1 character mistakes can be considered as a good balance between honest mistakes while maintaining security.\n\n## Mission Board Ratification\nSince this HIP has been recreated from an existing phase 2, the proposers have asked the Mission Boards to ratify the validity of this HIP. The board's vote on this phase 3 is proof enough that they confirm it's validity. (See https://gov.proofofhumanity.id/t/special-binding-mission-board-ratification-hip-27/1417)\n",

It should also be displayed on the forum.\nA proposer can also post this proposal on the current snapshot page.\nIf the amount of  “Change the snapshot page and add proposers” votes on any of the snapshot page exceeds the amount of “Make no change” on both snapshot pages, the proposal is accepted.\nIn case no proposal is created by a proposer within the voting period of the proposal on the new snapshot page and the amount of “Change the board composition and snapshot page” exceeds the amount of “Make no change”, the proposal is also accepted.\n* In case of proposals/votes being censored by another mean (ex: snapshot issue, issue with the snapshot administrator not adding proposers correctly) a similar process can be used to change the voting platform to a new platform.",

      "content": "```\nHIP: 27\ntitle: Allow 1-character mistakes in displayed addresses\nauthor: @Mizu @juanu\nstatus: Phase 2\ncreated: 2021-11-19\n```\n## Simple Summary\nThis proposal would modify the registry policy to allow for limited mistakes or omissions in the address displayed in a profile’s video.\n\n## Abstract\nMany profiles get challenged due to mistakes affecting a single character in the address displayed by the submitter in their video. This proposal would make it so a single such mistake would no longer be grounds for rejection. This would not reduce the security of the profile or the PoH registry in any practical terms as will be demonstrated below.\nMotivation\n\nSubmitters will often write down their address by hand instead of printing it or displaying it on another screen. This might be because they don’t have a printer or another device with a screen they can easily display it on, or simply because they find writing the address by hand to be more convenient at that time.\n\nAs one might expect, it is often the case that submitters make mistakes when copying their address. Sometimes, these are significant errors such as the omission of a large part of the address, in which case it might be possible for an attacker to generate matching addresses, but often the error will affect only one character. We may distinguish 4 types of errors:\n\n```\n- omitted character: a character is omitted from the address (e.g. “abcd” → “abd”)\n- mistaken character: a different character has been written in place of the one expected in that position (e.g. “abcd” → “ab9d”)\n- swapped adjacent characters: two characters adjacent to each other have been swapped (e.g. “abcd” → “acbd”)\n- additional character: an additional character has been inserted anywhere in the address (e.g. “abcd” → “abc0d”)\n```\n\nThis proposal would allow at most one of the above three errors in a displayed address. The effects on the security of an address (i.e. on the ability of an attacker to find a private key generating an address which would match the displayed address) would be the following:\n\n```\n- omitted character: 9.32 bits: lg(40*16): 40 positions to insert the missing character which has 16 possible values\n- mistaken character: 9.23 bits: lg(40*15): 40 characters with 15 possible invalid values each\n- swapped adjacent characters: 5.29 bits: lg(39): 39 possible swaps of adjacent characters, although note that this can be slightly lower still since not all swaps have an effect (e.g. in “abbd”, swapping the two \"b\"s has no effect)\n- additional character: 5.36 bits: lg(41): 41 choices for which character to delete\n```\n\nNote that if a character is missing (case 1.) the three other cases are no longer allowed, and conversely, if the displayed address has all 40 characters (case 2. and 3.), the first and fourth cases are no longer allowed, and if there is an extra character, then only case 4. may be considered. As a result the maximum security loss is max(lg(N_1), lg(N_2 + N_3), lg(N_4)) = max(9.32, 9.32, 5.36) = 9.32 bits, reducing the total security of an address from 160 to 150.68 bits. Given the low stakes involved in being able to create a fake profile with an existing PoH registration video and the fact that no one is likely to be able to crack 150 bits of an Ethereum key for the foreseeable future, this should be an acceptable security compromise.\n\nAt this point, it is worth noting that there is one disadvantage to this proposal: It will no longer be possible to find a person’s profile from the video alone without trying all possible allowed errors, which is to say 639 trials in the worst case. This is easily remedied with a simple software loop, but something to keep in mind.\n\n## Specification\nThe following text will be appended at the end of the first bullet point of subsection 4. of the “List of current required/optional elements and submission rules”:\n```\nA single one of the following errors occurring once will be tolerated in the displayed address:\n- omitted character: a character is omitted from the address (e.g. “abcd” → “abd”)\n- mistaken character: a different character has been written in place of the one expected in that position (e.g. “abcd” → “ab9d”)\n- swapped adjacent characters: two characters adjacent to each other have been swapped (e.g. “abcd” → “acbd”, but not “adcb”)\n- additional character: an additional character has been inserted anywhere in the address (e.g. “abcd” → “abc0d”)\n```\n--\n- See [Republish motivation](https://gov.proofofhumanity.id/t/phase-2-hip-27-allow-1-character-mistakes-in-displayed-address-updated/1275#republish-motivation)\n- See [Effects on Security](https://gov.proofofhumanity.id/t/phase-2-hip-27-allow-1-character-mistakes-in-displayed-address-updated/1275#specification)",

Current phrase states \"...and that I am not already registered in this registry\" which would be false for already registered users. The primary aim for this proposal would be to clearly define what the phrase should be.\n\n# Motivation\nThe renewals beginning in the following month is going to trigger more opportunistic challenges due to lack of clarification of the current text.\n\n# Specification\nAn upgrade to the metadata document should be added which will specify the renewal procedure.\nAdd a section with title \"Elements required for renewal\" and say\n\n> The renewal procedure will follow the same rules than the registry procedure **except:**\n> * The renewer must say <to be defined, see below>. Renewers should speak in their normal voice and should not attempt mimicking someone else’s voice. Speaking before or after the required sentence is acceptable. Poor English accents, mispronunciations, and the switch or oversight of words in that sentence are not grounds for rejections\n> * The sign should display in a readable manner the <time validation options, se below> \n\n## Proposed new phrases in English\n- “I certify that I am a real human and that I am renewing my registration on this registry” by @juanu\n- “I certify that I am a real human and that I am re-applying for this registry” by @Koki\n- \"“I certify that I am a real human, and this is my video for Proof of Humanity.” by @ruben\n\n## Proposed alternatives for time validation\nThe sign should show an ethereum blockhash, which could be \n* the time when the renewer clicked on the \"renew\" button. \n* some periodical reference time in the recent past, for example the midnight UTC of last day, or 00:01:00 UTC of the first day of each month. \n\nThe way that this time validation is generated should be less mistake-prone for the renewer, and easier/faster for the challenger to catch a mismatch. A solution that could prevent long character strings is to shorten the hash into an even shorter hash through some shortening algorithm. Ideally it would consist of 4-6 characters.\n\n---\n# Resumen simple\nAclarar cuál debe ser la frase para la renovación del perfil. \n\n# Resumen\nAhora que ha comenzado el periodo de renovación para algunos, hay algunas cuestiones relacionadas con la frase que debe utilizarse para la renovación. La frase actual dice \"...y que no esté ya inscrito en este registro\" lo cual sería falso para los usuarios ya registrados. El objetivo principal de esta propuesta sería definir claramente cuál debe ser la frase.\n\n# Motivación\nLas renovaciones que comienzan en el mes siguiente van a desencadenar más impugnaciones oportunistas debido a la falta de aclaración del texto actual.\n\n# Especificación\nDebería añadirse una actualización del documento de metadatos que especifique el procedimiento de renovación.\nAñadir una sección con el título \"Elementos necesarios para la renovación\" y decir\n\n> El procedimiento de renovación seguirá las mismas reglas que el procedimiento de registro **excepto:** > El renovador debe decir <a definir, véase más adelante>. Los renovadores deben hablar con su voz normal y no deben intentar imitar la voz de otra persona. Se acepta hablar antes o después de la frase requerida. El acento inglés deficiente, la mala pronunciación y el cambio u omisión de palabras en esa frase no son motivo de rechazo\n> * El cartel debe mostrar de manera legible las <opciones de validación de tiempo, se abajo> \n\n## Nuevas frases propuestas en inglés\n- \"Certifico que soy un humano real y que renuevo mi inscripción en este registro\" por @juanu\n- \"Certifico que soy un humano real y que vuelvo a solicitar mi inscripción en este registro\" por @Koki\n- \"Certifico que soy un humano real y que este es mi vídeo para la Prueba de Humanidad\" por @ruben\n\n## Alternativas propuestas para la validación del tiempo\nEl cartel debería mostrar un blockhash de ethereum, que podría ser \n* la hora en que el renovador hizo clic en el botón \"renovar\". \n* alguna hora de referencia periódica en el pasado reciente, por ejemplo la medianoche UTC del último día, o las 00:01:00 UTC del primer día de cada mes. \n\nLa forma en que se genera esta validación de la hora debería ser menos propensa a errores para el renovador, y más fácil para el retador para detectar un error. Una solución que podría evitar las cadenas de caracteres largas es acortar el hash en un hash aún más corto a través de algún algoritmo de acortamiento. Lo ideal sería que consistiera en 4-6 caracteres\n\n\n",

However the proposal is not specific about rules and parameters of the DAO except in the calculation of voting power. This lead to difference of interpretation of the rules of the DAO which could lead to disputes and stalling the execution of proposals (as people wouldn't want to take the risk to lose their deposit if the Kleros court were to rule against their interpretation of the rules of the new DAO).\n\nWhen asked to clarify those rules, the board decided that it didn't wish to rule on it and asked to have an HIP clarifying the rules. \n\nThis proposal clarifies that the UBI DAO starts with the same rules as the POH DAO at the time of its creation unless stated otherwise.\nIt's still possible for the UBI DAO to modify its own rules.\n\nCurrent UIP or UIP phases are considered to have been passed if they would have passed with the clarified rules of this proposal.\n\n## Specification\n\nThe UBI DAO rules are the sames the POH DAO rules at the time of HIP-22 unless stated otherwise in HIP-22 or a UBI DAO proposal. This applies to (non exhaustive list): Voting period, deposits on the governor app, challenge period, delegations and UIP process (working like the HIP process).\nIt is possible to change those rules via UIPs.\n\n### Implementation\n\nThis proposal doesn't require any coding but simply clarifies the rules for execution of UBI DAO decisions.",

      "title": "[Signalling][Phase 2] HIP 27: Allow 1-character mistakes in displayed addresses",
      "content": "HIP: 27\ntitle: Allow 1-character mistakes in displayed addresses\nauthor: Mizu\nstatus: Phase 2\ncreated: 2021-09-14\n\n## Simple Summary\n\nThis proposal would modify the registry policy to allow for limited mistakes or omissions in the address displayed in a profile’s video.\n\n## Abstract\n\nMany profiles get challenged due to mistakes affecting a single character in the address displayed by the submitter in their video. This proposal would make it so a single such mistake would no longer be grounds for rejection. This would not reduce the security of the profile or the PoH registry in any practical terms as will be demonstrated below.\n\n## Motivation\n\nSubmitters will often write down their address by hand instead of printing it or displaying it on another screen. This might be because they don’t have a printer or another device with a screen they can easily display it on, or simply because they find writing the address by hand to be more convenient at that time.\n\nAs one might expect, it is often the case that submitters make mistakes when copying their address. Sometimes, these are significant errors such as the omission of a large part of the address, in which case it might be possible for an attacker to generate matching addresses, but often the error will affect only one character. We may distinguish 4 types of errors:\n\n1. omitted character: a character is omitted from the address (e.g. “abcd” → “abd”)\n2. mistaken character: a different character has been written in place of the one expected in that position (e.g. “abcd” → “ab9d”)\n3. swapped adjacent characters: two characters adjacent to each other have been swapped (e.g. “abcd” → “acbd”)\n4. additional character: an additional character has been inserted anywhere in the address (e.g. “abcd” → “abc0d”)\n\nThis proposal would allow at most one of the above three errors in a displayed address. The effects on the security of an address (i.e. on the ability of an attacker to find a private key generating an address which would match the displayed address) would be the following:\n\n1. omitted character: 9.32 bits: lg(40*16): 40 positions to insert the missing character which has 16 possible values\n2. mistaken character: 9.23 bits: lg(40*15): 40 characters with 15 possible invalid values each\n3. swapped adjacent characters: 5.29 bits: lg(39): 39 possible swaps of adjacent characters, although note that this can be slightly lower still since not all swaps have an effect (e.g. in “abbd”, swapping the two \"b\"s has no effect)\n4. additional character: 5.36 bits: lg(41): 41 choices for which character to delete\n\nNote that if a character is missing (case 1.) the three other cases are no longer allowed, and conversely, if the displayed address has all 40 characters (case 2. and 3.), the first and fourth cases are no longer allowed, and if there is an extra character, then only case 4. may be considered. As a result the maximum security loss is max(lg(N_1), lg(N_2 + N_3), lg(N_4)) = max(9.32, 9.32, 5.36) = 9.32 bits, reducing the total security of an address from 160 to 150.68 bits. Given the low stakes involved in being able to create a fake profile with an existing PoH registration video and the fact that no one is likely to be able to crack 150 bits of an Ethereum key for the foreseeable future, this should be an acceptable security compromise.\n\nAt this point, it is worth noting that there is one disadvantage to this proposal: It will no longer be possible to find a person’s profile from the video alone without trying all possible allowed errors, which is to say 639 trials in the worst case. This is easily remedied with a simple software loop, but something to keep in mind.\n\nIt will also be desirable to make the conventional “0x” prefix explicitly optional too since it does not really serve a purpose and people have occasionally been penalized for omitting it.\n\n## Specification\n\nThe following text will be appended at the end of the first bullet point of subsection 4. of the “List of current required/optional elements and submission rules”:\n\n> The displayed address need not contain the prefix “0x”. A single one of the following errors occurring once will be tolerated in the displayed address:\n> \n> 1. omitted character: a character is omitted from the address (e.g. “abcd” → “abd”)\n> 2. mistaken character: a different character has been written in place of the one expected in that position (e.g. “abcd” → “ab9d”)\n> 3. swapped adjacent characters: two characters adjacent to each other have been swapped (e.g. “abcd” → “acbd”, but not “adcb”)\n> 4. additional character: an additional character has been inserted anywhere in the address (e.g. “abcd” → “abc0d”)",

This will help reduce criculating supply of UBI with half of the generated yield of these assets. Workers for the DAO should be paid using either ubiDAI or ubiWETH tokens. This helps set an example for other DAO treasuries out there.\n\n## Abstract\n\nThe Proof of Humanity DAO currently holds 46.48 ETH on its Kleros Governor contract & 34,051 DAI currently held on a Multisig setup to receive Gitcoin grants. \n\nIn order to support the burning of UBI with the Vaults implemented with the Yearn Finance community, we propose that rather than simply having the DAO holding these assets, these get deposited to the ubiWETH and the ubiDAI vaults that have been operational during the last two months.\n\nThe DAO will then hold ubiWETH and ubiDAI tokens, setting a clear example on how to support with its treasury the burning of UBI. This action can then be used as an example to invite other DAOs to do just the same thing in order to support Universal Basic Income on Ethereum. \n\nHired workers from the DAO in the future can also be directly paid with either ubiWETH or ubiDAI tokens and decide to withdraw themselves those funds any time they want to. \n\n## Implementation\n\nThe vaults can be currently accessed by end users on https://democracy.earth and are both currently at ~20% capacity. \n\n- The ubiWETH vault can be found on: https://etherscan.io/address/0x2147935d9739da4e691b8ae2e1437492a394ebf5\n\n- The ubiDAI vault can be found on: https://etherscan.io/address/0xdf5110ef6bc751cbaf76d35b8a3f312b581b5173\n\nETH will have to be converted to WETH first via a Uniswap or some other DEX swap, and once the WETH is available, it gets deposited to the ubiWETH vault.\n\nDAI will have to transferred to the DAO Governor first and once there it can be deposited on its corresponding ubiDAI vault. \n\n## Governor Setup\n\n- A swap of ETH for WETH on Uniswap.\n- An approval for the ubiWETH vault to use the WETH.\n- A transfer of the available WETH into the ubiWETH vault.\n- An approval for the ubiDAI vault to use the DAI.\n- A transfer of the available DAI into the ubiDAI vault.\n\n## Additional Notes\n\nIt's critical for the future of UBI to builid liquidity on these vaults so we can have a burning mechanisms that works at scale. Right now the vaults are capped at 1 million DAI and 400 ETH respectively. Each of them is currently at 20% capacity. \n\nBy setting a clear example coming from the Proof of Humanity DAO, we can then promote this action across the entire Ethereum ecosystem and invite other DAOs to support UBI this way.",

      "content": "```\nHIP: 29\ntitle: Deposit funds of the DAO to the UBI Burning Vaults\nauthor: @santisiri\nstatus: Phase 1\ncreated: 2021-08-26\nconflicts with: None\nlanguages: EN\n```\n\n## Simple Summary\n\nThe ETH and DAI held by the DAO should be deposited on the UBI burning vaults. This will help reduce criculating supply of UBI with half of the generated yield of these assets. Workers for the DAO should be paid using either ubiDAI or ubiWETH tokens. This helps set an example for other DAO treasuries out there.\n\n## Abstract\n\nThe Proof of Humanity DAO currently holds 46.48 ETH on its Kleros Governor contract & 34,051 DAI currently held on a Multisig setup to receive Gitcoin grants. \n\nIn order to support the burning of UBI with the Vaults implemented with the Yearn Finance community, we propose that rather than simply having the DAO holding these assets, these get deposited to the ubiWETH and the ubiDAI vaults that have been operational during the last two months.\n\nThe DAO will then hold ubiWETH and ubiDAI tokens, setting a clear example on how to support with its treasury the burning of UBI. This action can then be used as an example to invite other DAOs to do just the same thing in order to support Universal Basic Income on Ethereum. \n\nHired workers from the DAO in the future can also be directly paid with either ubiWETH or ubiDAI tokens and decide to withdraw themselves those funds any time they want to. \n\n## Implementation\n\nThe vaults can be currently accessed by end users on https://democracy.earth and are both currently at ~20% capacity. \n\n- The ubiWETH vault can be found on: https://etherscan.io/address/0x2147935d9739da4e691b8ae2e1437492a394ebf5\n\n- The ubiDAI vault can be found on: https://etherscan.io/address/0xdf5110ef6bc751cbaf76d35b8a3f312b581b5173\n\nETH will have to be converted to WETH first via a Uniswap or some other DEX swap, and once the WETH is available, it gets deposited to the ubiWETH vault.\n\nDAI will have to transferred to the DAO Governor first and once there it can be deposited on its corresponding ubiDAI vault. \n\n## Additional Notes\n\nIt's critical for the future of UBI to builid liquidity on these vaults so we can have a burning mechanisms that works at scale. Right now the vaults are capped at 1 million DAI and 400 ETH respectively. Each of them is currently at 20% capacity. \n\nBy setting a clear example coming from the Proof of Humanity DAO, we can then promote this action across the entire Ethereum ecosystem and invite other DAOs to support UBI this way.",

      "content": "HIP: 17\ntitle: Reduce Number of Kleros Jurors Drawn in First Rounds of POH Cases to One\nauthor: William George\nstatus: Phase-3\ncreated: 2021-07-23\n\nhttps://gov.proofofhumanity.id/t/phase-3-hip-17-reduce-number-of-kleros-jurors-drawn-in-first-rounds-of-poh-cases-to-one/969\n\nSimple Summary\nThis proposal would adjust the parameter that controls how many Kleros jurors are drawn in the first round of disputes concerning Proof of Humanity registrations/removals.\n\nAbstract\nI propose to reduce the registration deposit by specifying that the initial round of a dispute in case of profile registration (or removal request) challenge only draws one juror instead of three.\n\nSpecification\nThis would be done by updating the following Proof of Humanity parameter.\n\nUse changeArbitrator (specifically changing the _arbitratorExtraData) so that the initial round of a dispute only draws 1 juror.\n\nMotivation\nThe goal here is to reduce the value required for deposits, to the degree that this is securely possible. Currently, in the first round of Kleros disputes for Proof of Humanity cases, three jurors are drawn to rule on the case. This number of jurors was initially selected to ensure greater stability in rulings and a lower number of appeals while the registry was in its infancy. The deposit that new submitters to the list have to make needs to include enough ETH so that if the submission is ultimately challenged and rejected, the arbitration fees paid to those jurors can be taken from that deposit. Hence, if one starts with initial panels of only a single juror to judge Proof of Humanity cases, this reduces the size of required deposits to submit to the list.\n\nRecall that Kleros is a Schelling point based system and jurors are incentivized based on whether they are coherent with the final juror vote. Hence even when starting with only one juror, there is an incentive for that single juror to vote seriously because there is a potential for appeal. So if people think the juror voted incorrectly, there is likely to be an appeal and the first round juror would be rewarded or penalized based on what the appeal jurors decide. So far Kleros has used first round panels of only a single juror for Linguo (https://linguo.kleros.io/)\n\nThe negatives are that some borderline cases might not be appealed, so there is an added level of variability in terms of whether the first round juror represents how a larger panel would have voted, and that in (the minority of) cases where there is an appeal and you wind up back with a three juror panel anyway, there is an additional delay and some extra gas to have gone through the one juror round.",

      "content": "```\nHIP: 22\ntitle: Creation of the UBI DAO\nauthor: @santisiri @RustyTheGamer @clesaege @fraserdscott\nstatus: Phase 3\ncreated: 2021-07-01\nconflicts with: None\nlanguages: EN\n```\n\n## Simple Summary\n\nThis HIP will split the governance of the UBI smart contract from the governance of the Proof of Humanity protocol by creating a new DAO specifically for the monetary policy and technical innovations required for the Universal Basic Income ERC20 smart contract (UBI). \n\n## Abstract\n\nAs Proof of Humanity evolves, the protocol itself will maintain its `1 person 1 vote` governance model using liquid democracy but it will only have influence over the Proof of Humanity protocol itself and no longer influence changes over the UBI token. The UBI token will have moving forward a specific DAO of its own, where holders of UBI will be able to vote with their stake and thus make decisions that will have influence over the [UBI smart contract](https://etherscan.io/token/0xdd1ad9a21ce722c151a836373babe42c868ce9a4).\n\n## Motivation\n\nIn order to increase the demand-side pressure, improving the utility of the UBI token by making it useful for governance decisions that influence its own smart contract shall have a positive impact in price over the long term and incentivize long term accumulation from investors and holders. Governance staking has proven to be an effective influence for long term holding across multiple DeFi projects and from a legitimacy perspective, it makes sense that those with \"skin in the game\" get to advance the interests of UBI token holders.\n\nAlso, taking into consideration that UBI gets airdropped evenly to every verified human on Proof of Humanity, we don't consider this puts at risk the democratic ideals that we pursue as a community. On the contrary: this is aimed at increasing the value of UBI over the long term which shall ultimately benefit every Proof of Humanity member.\n\n## Specification\n\n###  The DAO\n\n1. UBI shall have a Snapshot page of its own where holders of UBI that are verified Proof of Humanity accounts will be able to vote with their holdings of UBI.  \n\n2. A Kleros Governor shall be setup to enforce on-chain the off-chain votes expressed on the UBI DAO.\n\n3. The DAO shall implement a Quadratic Voting scheme where holders will be able to vote with their stake but whales will be mitigated from excessively influencing the outcome of votes since the votes will be computed using the following formula: \n```\n(voting power = sqrt(balance) * isHuman())\n```\n\n4. From the treasury of the Proof of Humanity DAO that originally consisted of 4 million UBI, 50% will be sent to the UBI DAO (2 million UBI). This will not have impact over the ETH or any other assets currently under the custody of the Proof of Humanity DAO.\n\n### Implementation\n\n* The [UBIProxy.sol](https://github.com/DemocracyEarth/ubi/blob/master/contracts/UBIProxy.sol) smart contract will be used to create the UBIVOTE token as a proxy for the Snapshot page of UBI since it follows the voting formula specified above.\n\n* A Snapshot Page for UBI DAO will be created using the UBIVOTE token.\n\n* A Kleros Governor will be created to enforce on chain decisions made on the UBI DAO — The UBI Governor.\n\n* The UBI token smart contract proxy will be managed by the new UBI Governor created for the UBI DAO.\n\n* 2 million UBI from the [Proof of Humanity DAO treasury](https://etherscan.io/address/0x327a29fce0a6490e4236240be176daa282eccfdf) will be transfered to the UBI Governor.  \n\n### Additional Notes\n\nLarge holders of UBI that are not verified as Proof of Humanity members won't be able to participate in the DAO. This means that in order to engage with the DAO, UBI holdings must be used directly from a verified Proof of Humanity address. This will help understand the distribution of UBI across multiple accounts and measure the Gini coefficient of the community over the long term. \n\n### We Are United 💪\n\nLast but not least, this is by no means a split of the Proof of Humanity & UBI projects. They both share the same community and must remain connected through the User Interfaces that connect their smart contracts together so current and future users will begin accruing UBI once they finalize their profile.",

      "content": "```\nHIP: 22\ntitle: Creation of the UBI DAO\nauthor: @santisiri @RustyTheGamer\nstatus: Phase 1\ncreated: 2021-07-01\nconflicts with: None\nlanguages: EN\n```\n\n## Simple Summary\n\nThis HIP will split the governance of the UBI smart contract from the governance of the Proof of Humanity protocol by creating a new DAO specifically for the monetary policy and technical innovations required for the Universal Basic Income ERC20 smart contract (UBI). \n\n## Abstract\n\nAs Proof of Humanity evolves, the protocol itself will maintain its `1 person 1 vote` governance model using liquid democracy but it will only have influence over the Proof of Humanity protocol itself and no longer influence changes over the UBI token. The UBI token will have moving forward a specific DAO of its own, where holders of UBI will be able to vote with their stake and thus make decisions that will have influence over the [UBI smart contract](https://etherscan.io/token/0xdd1ad9a21ce722c151a836373babe42c868ce9a4).\n\n## Motivation\n\nIn order to increase the demand-side pressure, improving the utility of the UBI token by making it useful for governance decisions that influence its own smart contract shall have a positive impact in price over the long term and incentivize long term accumulation from investors and holders. Governance staking has proven to be an effective influence for long term holding across multiple DeFi projects and from a legitimacy perspective, it makes sense that those with \"skin in the game\" get to advance the interests of UBI token holders.\n\nAlso, taking into consideration that UBI gets airdropped evenly to every verified human on Proof of Humanity, we don't consider this puts at risk the democratic ideals that we pursue as a community. On the contrary: this is aimed at increasing the value of UBI over the long term which shall ultimately benefit every Proof of Humanity member.\n\n## Specification\n\n###  The DAO\n\n1. UBI shall have a Snapshot page of its own where holders of UBI that are verified Proof of Humanity accounts will be able to vote with their holdings of UBI.  \n\n2. A Kleros Governor shall be setup to enforce on-chain the off-chain votes expressed on the UBI DAO.\n\n3. The DAO shall implement a Quadratic Voting scheme where holders will be able to vote with their stake but whales will be mitigated from excessively influencing the outcome of votes since the votes will be computed using the following formula: \n```\n(voting power = sqrt(balance) * isHuman())\n```\n\n4. From the treasury of the Proof of Humanity DAO that originally consisted of 4 million UBI, 50% will be sent to the UBI DAO (2 million UBI). This will not have impact over the ETH or any other assets currently under the custody of the Proof of Humanity DAO.\n\n###  Proof of Humanity as UBI holder\n\nSince the Proof of Humanity DAO will remain as one of the largest holders of UBI, it can vote decisions with its UBI holdings but only after such decision has been voted by the members of the Proof of Humanity DAO first using the PoH Snapshot page. \n\n### Implementation\n\nThe [UBIProxy.sol](https://github.com/DemocracyEarth/ubi/blob/master/contracts/UBIProxy.sol) smart contract will be used as a proxy for the Snapshot page of UBI since it follows the voting formula specified above.\n\n### Additional Notes\n\nLarge holders of UBI that are not verified as Proof of Humanity members won't be able to participate in the DAO. This means that in order to engage with the DAO, UBI holdings must be used directly from a verified Proof of Humanity address. This will help understand the distribution of UBI across multiple accounts and measure the Gini coefficient of the community over the long term. \n\nLast but not least, this is by no means a split of the Proof of Humanity & UBI projects. They both share the same community and must remain connected through the User Interfaces that connect their smart contracts together so current and future users accrue UBI once they finalize their profile.

      "content": "HIP: 17\ntitle: Reduce Number of Kleros Jurors Drawn in First Rounds of POH Cases to One\nauthor: William George\nstatus: Phase-2\ncreated: 2021-07-23\n\nhttps://gov.proofofhumanity.id/t/phase-2-hip-17-reduce-number-of-kleros-jurors-drawn-in-first-rounds-of-poh-cases-to-one/933\n\nSimple Summary\nThis proposal would adjust the parameter that controls how many Kleros jurors are drawn in the first round of disputes concerning Proof of Humanity registrations/removals.\n\nAbstract\nI propose to reduce the registration deposit by specifying that the initial round of a dispute in case of profile registration (or removal request) challenge only draws one juror instead of three.\n\nThis would be done by updating the following Proof of Humanity parameter.\n\nUse changeArbitrator (specifically changing the _arbitratorExtraData) so that the initial round of a dispute only draws 1 juror.\n\nMotivation\nThe goal here is to reduce the value required for deposits, to the degree that this is securely possible. Currently, in the first round of Kleros disputes for Proof of Humanity cases, three jurors are drawn to rule on the case. This number of jurors was initially selected to ensure greater stability in rulings and a lower number of appeals while the registry was in its infancy. The deposit that new submitters to the list have to make needs to include enough ETH so that if the submission is ultimately challenged and rejected, the arbitration fees paid to those jurors can be taken from that deposit. Hence, if one starts with initial panels of only a single juror to judge Proof of Humanity cases, this reduces the size of required deposits to submit to the list.\n\nRecall that Kleros is a Schelling point based system and jurors are incentivized based on whether they are coherent with the final juror vote. Hence even when starting with only one juror, there is an incentive for that single juror to vote seriously because there is a potential for appeal. So if people think the juror voted incorrectly, there is likely to be an appeal and the first round juror would be rewarded or penalized based on what the appeal jurors decide. So far Kleros has used first round panels of only a single juror for Linguo (https://linguo.kleros.io/)\n\nThe negatives are that some borderline cases might not be appealed, so there is an added level of variability in terms of whether the first round juror represents how a larger panel would have voted, and that in (the minority of) cases where there is an appeal and you wind up back with a three juror panel anyway, there is an additional delay and some extra gas to have gone through the one juror round.",

A 5th member and a tie-breaking vote are also added for the case when the board cannot come to unanimous consent. \n\n**Abstract**\nThe Mission Board needs to function also in the case when decisions are disputed. Therefore we need some simple rules for what happens when there is no consensus. This proposal clarifies what happens in case of dispute, clarifies the limit to the power of the board, and adds two tie-breaking mechanisms - a 5th board member and a tie-breaking vote.\n\n**Motivation**\nA board member contacted me about concerns about the functioning of the board. HIP-7 made the board sound too much like management, and the powers could be interpreted too broadly. In addition, it assumed that the board would function completely without disputes, which was a bit naive. So this proposal seeks to address these issues by adding mechanisms for dispute resolution. The biggest mechanism is adding a 5th board member for election immediately, making the board an uneven number.  \n\n**Specification**\nAmend HIP-7 with the following paragraphs:\n\nPower Scope:\n* The board is NOT management cannot direct any actions unless it relates to a decision by the DAO (Such as if a proposal is correctly passed according to HIP-5).\n* The board has, however, broad power to interpret the rules of the DAO, including filling in details not specified in a proposal. (Such as a proposal calling for an election and deciding to hold a quadratic voting election with pre-announced candidates).\n\nDispute resolution:\n* A board member can judge whether a proposal or action follows the rules of the DAO. When acting in this way, the board member must clearly state it (instead of just stating an opinion as a normal PoH member).\n* Any member can ask another board member to weigh in on a judgment.\n* If the board members disagree on the judgment, they will need a majority vote among the board members to make a final decision.\n* A tie-breaking vote will be held by the board member whose seat will be up for election at the latest date. (Tie-breaker is added for the case when a seat is unoccupied or a member abstains from voting)\n\nElection rules:\n* A board member can step down, leaving their seat unoccupied.\n* Unoccupied seats are immediately up for election.\n* A seat can maximally be occupied for 5 years before a new election for that board seat is required. (The interim board members are still limited to 1 year as pr. HIP-7)\n\nA 5th member:\n* An unoccupied 5th seat is opened on the board.\n\n**Rationale**\nThis proposal attempts to contradict nothing in HIP-7, neither the spirit nor the letter.

      "title": "[Binding] HIP-16 HIP-16: Make admin roles of communication platforms eligible",
      "content": "# English version\n## Simple Summary\n\nThis HIP institutes a mechanism to determine the position of admin in the social communication tools that voluntarily want to be recognized as official by the DAO, either social media (twitter, reddit) or communication channels (telegram groups).\n\n## Abstract\n\nIn order to further decentralize positions of enforcement within the DAO, there is the need to create mechanisms in which channels of communication get the seal of “Community Managed [channel]” (i.e. “PoH Subreddit, Community Managed”).\n\n## Motivation\n\nFollowing the spirit of HIP-5, which creates a framework for management of the DAO without altering the smart contract, I propose a better mechanism for establishing enforcing roles on all recognized channels of communication.\n\n## Specification\n\n### 1. Definitions\n\n1. Administrative role, administrator, or admin: the position that a person has over a channel of communication, it being social media accounts, forums, instant messaging groups. In this position, the person has privileges to enforce policies of the convened rules of these channels and include muting, removal or admitting the participation of the members of the group, along with other administrative tasks. Although they are free to do so, it is not the responsibility of the person holding the admin role to moderate dialogue or content creation, which is a role more commonly known as community manager, moderator, facilitator, etc. An admin may be assigned the role of moderator by the authority responsible for that (Product Manager, Mission Board), but moderators assignment and mechanisms are outside of this HIP.\n2. Community-managed channel: a volunteer status for any of the channels in the Scope of this HIP in which there is an agreement of the channel owner/creator to be associated with PoH. It is accompanied by a badge or a seal or any piece of text that clearly recognizes them as such.\n\n### 2. Scope\n\nRoles for admin positions for each of the Community-Managed channels of communication would be temporary roles and elected from the community. These include (non-exhaustive list):\n\n* Discourse forum\n* Twitter\n* Facebook groups\n* Reddit\n* Discord\n* WhatsApp\n* Instagram\n* Telegram groups, users and channels\n\n### Elections\n\n1. Elections are made separately by platform.\n2. Elections should be done in the Tokenlog platform ([here's the current implementation](https://tokenlog.xyz/Proof-Of-Humanity/proof-of-humanity-web), new repositories will be created on Github solely for the purpose of the Administrator election on each of the platforms).\n3. Elections are ongoing.\n4. Elections are made using quadratic voting (negative votes are allowed).\n5. Each Human will receive 99 voting credits.\n6. Ideally, there should be 1 elected admin for every 500 users in a channel (since the position is voluntary, there might be less than 1 elected admin per 500 users).\n7. The top candidates with a positive score will take their positions (e.g. on a channel with 2.715 members, the top 5 candidates with a positive score will become the official Administrators).\n8. Each time one of the official Administrators lose their position on Tokenlog's ranking, the next candidate to come up in the rank will gain the official role as Administrator.\n9. Admin roles should be registered individuals in Proof of Humanity.\n10. Roles are only revocable for security reasons or serious offenses to the community. The Mission Board can call an emergency voting of 24h in Snapshot. Admins revoked in this way cannot re-apply for the role in the next term.\n11. Admin roles are not moderator roles, therefore do not require to suppress their opinions in debates, as long as they follow the code of conduct established for that channel. Mere opposition to that admin’s opinion should not be grounds for the admin to ban that person.\n\n### Administrators obligations\n\nAdministrators acknowledge that access to communication channels or profiles labelled as “admin” gives them an additional power, which comes with additional responsibilities. They are expected to behave as ambassadors of the project. In addition to following the appropriate codes of conduct:\n\n* They should refrain from expressing virulent opinions about Proof Of Humanity or related projects with their admin accounts.\n* They are subject to higher standards in terms of good conduct (ex: avoiding excessive profanity, or engaging in debates on topics outside of Proof of Humanity, such as politics or religion).\n\nThis doesn’t preclude them from formalizing criticism on Proof Of Humanity. However, it should be done either in (i) a technical and dispassionate manner, and preferably offering constructive solutions, or (ii) using a non-admin account.\n\n### “Community-managed” status implementation\n\n1. The owner of any channel of communication within the scope of this HIP can contact the Mission board and apply for the “Community-managed” status.\n2. A call for volunteers is offered in the channel and those members participate in the election process.\n3. Once that process is finished and the elected members are occupying their roles, that channel receives the “community managed” badge, and a link to that channel will be provided in Proof of Humanity project site, and referenced throughout the rest of the channel's ecosystem.\n4. Failure to comply with any aspect of this HIP would trigger the removal of that channel from the “community managed list”\n\n### Special first condition\n\nFor their significance, and to spearhead the value of having the “Community managed” status, the following channels should enter the admin selection process effective immediately:\n\n* Telegram Group Proof of Humanity https://t.me/proofhumanity\n* Telegram Group Proof of Humanity en Español https://t.me/proofofhumanityenespanol\n* Telegram Group Proof of Humanity Chinese https://t.me/ProofOfHumanityCN\n* Telegram Group Proof of Humanity Portuguese https://t.me/poh_pt\n* Subreddit Proof of Humanity https://www.reddit.com/r/proofofhumanity\n\n## Rationale\n\nCurrently, the admin positions in communication channels that have grown to the thousands of users, were subject to the initiative of the person that first created the channel, (telegram, reddit). These roles right now are virtually permanent, without rules that govern their time in that position, or how or why their roles were assigned. This creates space for centralization and the possibility of indefinite perpetuation in the position, among other issues that arise from this permanence in their role (silencing opposition, pushing a specific agenda, creating a hostile environment, etc.). Some object that this is not an important role to be considered for election, or that this will lead to voting fatigue. There are enough reasons to believe that this proposal will not lead to this sort of problems.\n\n----\n## Version en Español\nDisponible en este link: https://gov.proofofhumanity.id/t/phase-3-hip-16-make-admin-roles-of-communication-platforms-eligible/786",

      "content": "**Introduction**\n\nI’ve been observing that conversations on the Proof of Humanity telegram channels are sometimes taken over by groups using toxic memes and super heavy language like “poorfag” and “retard”.\n\nNot only this makes many, me included, feel alienated from these spaces, but it is detrimental to our ability to have productive debates and collaborate as a community.\n\nHere’s a minimal Code of Conduct which i think could be helpful for us to have on the Proof of Humanity telegram channels. This final version is the result of integrating all of the comments and critiques made by the community in this thread. Thank you all for your contributions, especially:\n\n@0x00555dc77a343e205cb1c7755407c93470db3f91_Ethereum \n@HBesso31 \n@Nuwanda \n\nIt also adapted sections from the Citizen Code of Conduct and the RadicalxChange Community Code of Conduct. \n\n**Here it is:**\n\n* Proof of Humanity is committed to the principle of openness, and facilitating a free exchange of ideas in an environment of thoughtful discourse.\n\n* Proof of Humanity is committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, disability, ethnicity, religion, or similar personal characteristic.\n\n* The following behaviors will lead you to being banned from the channel:\n\nThreats of violence or violent language.\n\nSexually explicit material or language.\n\nSexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist or otherwise discriminatory jokes and language.\n\nPersonal insults.\n\nSpamming, trolling, baiting or other attention-stealing behavior is not welcome.\n\nImpersonating another person by copying their avatar, posting content under their email address, intentionally using a deceptively similar username or otherwise posing as someone else.\n\nDoxxing and invasion of privacy: posting other people’s personal information, such as phone numbers, private email addresses, physical addresses, credit card numbers, Social Security/National Identity numbers, or passwords. Depending on the context, such as in the case of intimidation or harassment, other information, such as photos or videos that were taken or distributed without the subject’s consent, may be considered to be an invasion of privacy, especially when such material presents a safety risk to the subject.\n\n--\n**Channel admins will be responsible for enforcing this Code of Conduct, according to these rules:**\n\n* If they consider a transgression to be less severe they may choose to give an initial warning instead of a ban.\n\n* If a user has already received a 24 hour ban and disrespects the Code of Conduct once again, they shall be permanently banned.\n\nFORUM POST: https://gov.proofofhumanity.id/t/phase-2-hip-19-code-of-conduct-for-poh-telegram-channels/769",

      "content": "```\nHIP: 18\ntitle: Communication roles\nauthor: @clesaege\nstatus: Phase 2\ncreated: 2021-06-17\nconflicts with: HIP-16\nlanguages: EN\n```\n\n# English version\n\n## Simple Summary\n\nThis HIP institutes a mechanism to determine the position of administrator in the social communication tools that are recognized as official by the DAO, either social media (twitter, reddit) or communication channels (telegram groups).\n\n## Abstract\n\nIn order to further decentralize positions of enforcement within the DAO, there is the need to create mechanisms in which the role for administrator of the communication channels **generally regarded as official** (*GRAO*, from now on, defined in the Specification section).\n\n## Motivation\n\nFollowing the spirit of HIP-5, which creates a framework for management of the DAO without altering the smart contract, I propose a better mechanism for establishing enforcing roles within the all recognized channels of communication.\n\n## Specification\n\n### Definitions\n\n1. Administrative role or admin: the position that a person has over a channel of communication, it being social media accounts, forums, instant messaging groups. In this position, the person has privileges to enforce policies or the convened rules of these channels and include muting, removal or admitting the participation of the members of the group, along with other administrative tasks.\n2. Channel Generally Regarded as Official (GRAO): a volunteer status for any of the channels in the scope of this HIP in which there is an agreement of the channel owner/creator to be acting on behalf of Proof Of Humanity.\n\n### Scope\n\nRoles for admin positions for each of the GRAO channels of communication would be temporary roles and elected from the community. These are for example (non exhaustive list):\n\n* Discord forum\n* Twitter\n* Facebook groups\n* Reddit\n* Discord\n* WhatsApp\n* Instagram\n* Telegram groups, users and channels\n\n### Elections\n\n1. Elections are made separately by platform.\n2. Before any election is held on a platform, the mission board assumes the administrative powers (each board member counting as an administrator).\n3. For platforms controlled by the mission board, 3 members wishing to be candidate can call for an election.\n4. When they do so, there is a 1 week period to let time for other candidates to apply.\n5. Elections are made using quadratic voting (negative votes are allowed). *\n6. Each Human will receive 99 voting credits.\n7. The top 3 candidates with a positive score would be elected.\n8. If there are less than 3 candidates with a positive score, there may be less than 3 admins for this channel.\n9. Admin roles are to be elected for a period of 1 year.\n10. In case the mission board believes some administrator is harming the Proof Of Humanity interest, it can call an emergency 24h vote to remove an administrator.\n\n* Currently we will use tokenlog for those votes. If a dedicated voting system becomes available, the DAO could switch to use it. Note that in the current state of tokenlog the interface may not natively support delegations (either not count delegations or allows both the elector and delegate votes to be counted resulting in a double count), we may initially need to run a script to give the results (accounting for delegations) but if possible a proper interface would be used.\n\n## Administrators obligations\n\nAdministrators acknowledge that access to communication channels or profiled labelled as “admin” give them an additional power which comes with additional responsibilities. They are expected to behave as ambassadors of the project. In addition to following the appropriate codes of conduct:\n\n* They should refrain from expressing virulent opinions about Proof Of Humanity or related projects with their admin accounts.\n* They are subject to higher standards in term of good conduct (ex: avoiding excessive profanity).\n\nThis doesn’t preclude them from formalizing criticism on Proof Of Humanity. However, it should be done either in a purely technical manner, or using a non-admin account.\n\n## Conflict with [HIP-16](https://gov.proofofhumanity.id/t/phase-3-hip-16-make-admin-roles-of-communication-platforms-eligible/786)\n\nThis proposal is an alternate version of HIP-16 with a few modifications. In case both those proposals were to be accepted, another direct vote (which would not have to go through the classic HIP process) would be required:\n\n> Which HIP should take precedence?\n>\n>\n>\n> * HIP-16\n> * HIP-18\n\n## Delegations\n\nAdministrators can delegate their administrative powers to anyone they see fit. They can remove delegations they made at any time without having to provide any justification.\nIn case an elected administrators disagree on a delegation made by another administrator, the administrators conduct a vote. In case of removal or tied result, the delegate have their delegation removed.\n\n## Rationale\n\nCurrently, the admin positions in communication channels *GRAO*, were subject to the initiative of the person that first created the channel, (telegram, reddit). These roles right now are virtually permanent, without rules that govern their time in that position, or how or why their roles were assigned. This creates space for centralization and the possibility of indefinite perpetuation in the position, among other issues that arise from this permanence in their role (silencing opposition, pushing a specific agenda, creating a hostile environment, etc.). We’ve seen that different admins sometimes have significant divergence of opinion about how channels should be handled and it had led to a few virulent discussions. This proposal establishes a clear and objective way people are added or removed from admin positions.\nThis proposal is mainly taken from HIP-16 but with some changes in the details to make it more practical (allowing delegations, having higher standards for administrator conduct) and to clarify the voting method.",

Looking forward to refine this with the input of the community and put it to a vote.** \n\n1. Proof of Humanity is committed to the principle of openness, and facilitating a free exchange of ideas in an environment of thoughtful discourse.\n\n2. Proof of Humanity is committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, disability, ethnicity, religion, or similar personal characteristic.\n\n3. The following behaviors will lead you to being banned from the channel (adapted from the Citizen Code of Conduct) :\n\n* Threats of violence or violent language.\n\n* Sexually explicit material or language.\n\n* Sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist or otherwise discriminatory jokes and language.\n\n* Personal insults.\n\n* Spamming, trolling, baiting or other attention-stealing behavior is not welcome.\n\n* Impersonating another person by copying their avatar, posting content under their email address, intentionally using a deceptively similar username or otherwise posing as someone else.\n\n* Doxxing and invasion of privacy: posting other people’s personal information, such as phone numbers, private email addresses, physical addresses, credit card numbers, Social Security/National Identity numbers, or passwords. Depending on the context, such as in the case of intimidation or harassment, we may consider other information, such as photos or videos that were taken or distributed without the subject’s consent, to be an invasion of privacy, especially when such material presents a safety risk to the subject.\n\n----\nWhoever is serving as admin could be responsible for enforcing this Code of Conduct. If they consider a transgression to be less severe they may choose to give an initial warning and only resort to banning if the transgression continues.",

Definitions \n1. Administrative role or admin: the position that a person has over a channel of communication, it being social media accounts, forums, instant messaging groups. In this position, the person has privileges to enforce policies or the convened rules of these channels and include muting, removal or admitting the participation of the members of the group, along with other administrative tasks.\n2. Channel Generally Regarded as Oficial (GRAO):  a volunteer status for any of the channels in the `Scope` of this HIP in which there is an agreement of the channel owner/creator to be associated with PoH. \n### Scope\n1. Roles for admin positions for each of the GRAO channels of communication would be temporary roles and elected from the community. These are:\n  * Discord forum\n  * Twitter\n  * Facebook groups\n  * Reddit\n  * Discord\n  * WhatsApp\n  * Instagram\n  * Telegram groups, users and channels\n\n### Elections\n1. Admin roles are to be elected during a period of 6 months, starting from the date and time of the finalization of the Snapshot poll. \n2. Elections should be done in the Snapshot platform.  \n3. To prevent ties in conflicting decisions within the role, an uneven number of admins will be appointed, ideally 3 (or 5, depending of size and complexity of the platform): \n   * 2 (or 3) belonging to the elected majority\n   * 1 (or 2) belonging to the elected minority \n4. Admin roles should be registered individuals\n5. Candidacy lists should be posted and pinned (where available) in the respective platform. Candidacy period begin 3 weeks before the admin renewal date and end a week before the renewal date.\n6. For the time being, re-election for the role could be allowed. \n7. Roles are only revocable for security reasons or serious offenses to the community. The Mission Board can call an emergency voting of 24h in Snapshot. Admins revoked in this way cannot re-apply for the role in the next term. \n8.

This creates space for centralization and the possibility of indefinite perpetuation in the position, among other issues that arise from this permanence in their role (silencing opposition, pushing a specific agenda, creating a hostile environment, etc.). Some object that this is not an important role to be considered for election, or that this will lead to voting fatigue. There are enough reasons to believe that this proposal will not lead to this sort of problems.\n\n\n----\n# Versión en español\n## Resumen simple\nEste HIP instituye un mecanismo para determinar la posición del administrador en las herramientas de comunicación social que son reconocidas como oficiales por el DAO, ya sean medios sociales (twitter, reddit) o canales de comunicación (grupos de telegram). \n\n\n## Resumen\nCon el fin de descentralizar aún más las posiciones de aplicación dentro de la DAO, existe la necesidad de crear mecanismos en los que el papel de administrador de los canales de comunicación **generalmente considerados como oficiales** (*GRAO*, a partir de ahora, definido en la sección de Especificaciones).\n\n## Motivación\n\nSiguiendo el espíritu de HIP-5, que crea un marco para la gestión de la DAO sin alterar el contrato inteligente, propongo un mejor mecanismo para establecer los roles de administrador dentro de todos los canales de comunicación reconocidos. \n\n## Especificación\n### 1. Definiciones \n1. Rol administrativo o admin: es la posición que una persona tiene sobre un canal de comunicación, siendo cuentas de medios sociales, foros, grupos de mensajería instantánea. En esta posición, la persona tiene privilegios para hacer cumplir las políticas o las reglas convocadas de estos canales e incluyen silenciar, eliminar o admitir la participación de los miembros del grupo, junto con otras tareas administrativas.\n2. Canal Generalmente Considerado como Oficial (GRAO): es un estatus voluntario para cualquiera de los canales en el `Ámbito` de este HIP en el que existe un acuerdo del propietario/creador del canal para ser asociado al PoH. \n### Alcance\n1. Los roles para los puestos de administrador para cada uno de los canales de comunicación de GRAO serían roles temporales y elegidos entre la comunidad. Estos son:\n  * Foro de discordia\n  * Twitter\n  * Grupos de Facebook\n  * Reddit\n  * Discord\n  * WhatsApp\n  * Instagram\n  * Grupos, usuarios y canales de Telegram\n\n### Elecciones\n1. Los roles de administrador se elegirán durante un período de 6 meses, a partir de la fecha y hora de finalización de la encuesta de Instantánea. \n2. Las elecciones deben realizarse en la plataforma Snapshot.  \n3. Para evitar empates en las decisiones conflictivas dentro del rol, se nombrará un número impar de administradores, idealmente 3 (o 5, dependiendo del tamaño y complejidad de la plataforma): \n   * 2 (o 3) pertenecientes a la mayoría elegida\n   * 1 (o 2) perteneciente a la minoría elegida \n4. Los roles de administrador deben ser personas registradas\n5. Las listas de candidatos deben ser publicadas y fijadas (si están disponibles) en la plataforma respectiva. El período de candidatura comienza 3 semanas antes de la fecha de renovación de los administradores y termina una semana antes de la fecha de renovación.\n6. Por el momento, se podría permitir la reelección para el rol. \n7. Los roles sólo son revocables por razones de seguridad o por ofensas graves a la comunidad. El Consejo de la Misión puede convocar una votación de emergencia de 24 horas en Snapshot. Los administradores revocados de este modo no podrán volver a solicitar el rol en el siguiente mandato. \n8. Los roles de admin no son roles de moderador, por lo tanto no requieren suprimir sus opiniones en los debates, siempre y cuando sigan el código de conducta establecido para ese canal. La mera oposición a la opinión de ese admin no debe ser motivo para que el admin banee a esa persona.\n\n## Justificación\nActualmente, los puestos de admin en los canales de comunicación *GRAO*, estaban sujetos a la iniciativa de la persona que creó primero el canal, (telegram, reddit). Estos roles ahora mismo son prácticamente permanentes, sin reglas que regulen su tiempo en esa posición, o cómo o por qué fueron asignados sus roles. Esto crea un espacio para la centralización y la posibilidad de perpetuarse indefinidamente en el puesto, entre otros problemas que surgen de esta permanencia en su rol (silenciar a la oposición, impulsar una agenda específica, crear un ambiente hostil, etc.). Algunos objetan que este no es un papel importante para ser considerado para la elección, o que esto conducirá a la fatiga del voto. Hay suficientes razones para creer que esta propuesta no dará lugar a este tipo de problemas.\n\nTraducción realizada con la versión gratuita del traductor www.DeepL.com/Translator",

This locking mechanism can either be applied to new or existing decisions.\n\nMotivation\nFor some decisions, we need to signal to the world and ourselves that they are very unlikely to be overturned in the future and that it would require a lot of effort to do so. One such decision would be to, for instance, lock the $UBI issuance rate to ensure that people can forecast the value of the currency, improving stability.\n\nSpecification\nThere would be three ways of creating a locked decision.\n\nIn a new proposal, the decision can be locked immediately. A separate section, “Locking Justification”, arguing why this decision should be locked, must be included.\nFor an existing approved proposal, the decision can be locked by creating a new proposal to lock the earlier decision.\nAn existing locked decision can be put up for a new locking vote to increase the reversal threshold further. This new vote requires a separate proposal.\nTo create a valid locking proposal (cases 1-3):\n\nSome version of the verb “Lock” must be included in the title of the proposal topic.\n\nAll minimum poll voting times are doubled both for phase-2 and phase-3.\n\nIn a phase-3 binding vote the word “Locking” must be prepended for the signal poll along with any other required keyword.\n\nHow locking works:\n\nIn a locking vote, a minimum of 60 % approval is needed, if the approval is less then the proposal fails completely.\n\nIf the locking threshold is exceeded then a reversal threshold is set. The reversal threshold will be the approval rate of the proposal, rounded down to the nearest 5 %. So a proposal passing at 74.5 % would later require a 70 % vote to repeal.\n\nIf the reversal threshold would be set to above 90 % by the above rule then it is instead set to 90 %.\n\nIf locked decisions exist the locking mechanism itself can only be repealed by achieving a majority corresponding to the highest reversal threshold of any locked proposal.\n\nAdditions and exceptions to a locked proposal can only be introduced by other locking proposals with an approval rate higher than the reversal threshold.\n\nRationale\nThis implementation allows the community to make reversing a decision very hard - but not impossible. The difficulty of reversing a decision scales with the amount of agreement at an earlier time. Consideration was also to include a requirement that some quorum of voters must participate in the vote, but this was dropped since this would make the difficulty of reversing a decision too linked to user participation which may vary in unpredictable ways over time. The locking of the issuance rate is postponed, since creating a locking mechanism AND using it on something so central would be too much for one vote.",

      "content": "https://gov.proofofhumanity.id/t/phase-3-hip-7-institute-a-mission-board/424\n\nSummary\nThis proposal is to create a board of members with the responsibility of managing the DAO resources (employees, websites, money) in accordance with democratic decisions. In addition, the current group of people managing the website, snapshot, and forum are designated as an interim board for the duration of 1 year after approval.\n\nAbstract\nFor the DAO to function, it requires trusted members to act as advisors to the management as well as a check on it. This board should handle the access to funds and resources to the management, monitor their performance, and ensure that the technical implementation of voting and other procedures are securely implemented.\n\nThese tasks are naturally already handled by the informal leaders instituted by the creators of the Dao. However, this proposal would give them a formal mandate by the community and put a time limit before the board positions would become individually elected.\n\nSince the DAO does not yet have a robust mechanism for voting the second part of the proposal is that the current members filling this task from Kleros and Democracy.Earth will be formalized as the interim board for the period of 1 year after approval.\n\nMotivation\nAt the moment, the creators of the DAO have control of all resources as a trusted group. However, to have a democratic institution this power needs to be under democratic control. In addition, the employees of the DAO need to be treated consistently by the same group of people to ensure good working conditions.\n\nSpecification\nThe current informal managers, from Kleros and Democracy.Earth are formalized as the “Mission Board” for a period of 1 year after adoption.\nThe initial board: @santisiri, @Herb @clesaege and @federicoast\n\nThereafter elections should be held for the positions on the board before the end of the 1-year interim period.\n\nThe mission board will jointly manage the following:\n\nTechnical implementation of voting\nAccess to critical wallets.\nAccess right to funds by management\nPayment to employees\nAny resource requiring high trust by the community\nIn addition, the board will\n\nAdvise management, administer their payment, and monitor their performance.\nAdjudicate if the proper procedure is followed on passing proposals.\nBe authorized to issue mission statements on behalf of the DAO.\nConflict of interests\n\nA position of the mission board is incompatible with any other paid or elected position in the DAO.\nA board member applying or running for a position in the DAO must first step down from the board before they can be considered.\nA person running for the board can have another paid or elected position in the DAO, while applying or running, but must immediately terminate this position upon entering the board.\nRationale\nThe proposal is meant to improve democratic control but not disrupt current operations. The role of the board is what is already being done by a trusted group or will be done in the near future. But this group would have some difficulty explaining their special role with no democratic mandate.\n\nWe could decide to elect a board immediately, but since we don’t yet have defined voting robust procedures we would run a serious risk of taking a lot of time with this and disrupting the progress on other fronts. This is why the option of elevating the current informal leaders to elected (accept/reject) status but for only 1 year.\n\nBoard members should not be allowed to have or apply for any other position in the DAO. The board is tasked with managing the voting systems and could therefore potentially rig it in their own favor. And the same goes because they manage the resources for management.\n\nImplementation\nNothing really changes, except that elections must be held for the board positions before the year is out. If possible the board members should be marked as such on Discourse.",

      "content": "https://gov.proofofhumanity.id/t/phase-2-hip-14-lock-the-1-ubi-hour-person-issuance-rate/626\n\nSimple Summary\nThe proposal is to elevate the issuance rate of 1 $UBI/hour/person to a formal decision and allow no other form of $UBI issuance. Furthermore to lock the decision using the locking mechanism proposed in HIP-10.\n\nAbstract\nThe issuance rate of $UBI is 1 $UBI/hour/person, which seems to be very satisfactory to the community. However, we lack a decision specifying this issuance rate. This proposal formally adopts this issuance rate and bans all other forms of issuance - for instance putting tokens directly into the DAO account. In addition, the decision will be locked using the new HIP-10 mechanism, which will need to pass before this proposal can be put to a final vote. The decision is mostly about sending a signal to ourselves and others that the issuance rate is holy and will not be changed, ever.\n\nMotivation\nA good currency needs dependability - if it operates under rules that are unlikely to change then people will be more likely to trust it. The burning rate question will be left open, but just fixing the issuance rate will already make future supply much easier to predict.\nAnd future problems can be addressed within changing issuance:\n\nIf we need to raise the income, then we but increase the value of the token.\nIf we need money, we but get outside funding or increase revenue.\n\nLocking Motivation\nLocking the decision will send a signal to ourselves and others that $UBI will never be changed. This will deflate arguments against investing time and money in the currency because “the DAO could just put 3 million in its account at any time.”\n\nSpecification\nThe $UBI token will be issued at a rate of 1 $UBI/hour/human.\nNo other issuance of $UBI will be allowed.\n\nRationale\nThis proposal was split off from HIP-10 as a separate proposal because it had too great an impact on the future of the DAO.",

      "content": "HIP: 13\ntitle: Adopt a management onboarding procedure\nauthor: @Mads\nstatus: Phase-2\ncreated: 2021-05-21\namends: HIP-2\n\nhttps://gov.proofofhumanity.id/t/hip-13-phase-2-adopt-a-management-onboarding-procedure/658\n\nSimple Summary\nThis proposal makes rules for how to hire the management of the DAO, excepting this as a special case of the general hiring procedures.\n\nAbstract\nThe management onboarding procedure suggested here is designed to allow applicants to request the resources they need and describe their plan to finance these resources. They can describe who they need to be hired - filling open positions as well as creating new ones. They can suggest dedicated budgets for specific purposes. They also need to describe how these resources are paid for. The budget and financing plan can be as slim (hire me for PM, we will figure it out later) or as expansive as the proposer desires.\n\nThe procedure also sets a way to decide when we pass on to a decision. We use polls to decide how much time we need to decide/wait for more applications, when the date comes we create a poll to either pass to a decision or extend the application process.\n\nMotivation\nThis proposal is inspired by the applications that the DAO received to the product manager position. Two of the applicant, @paulaberman and @HBesso31, applied to the position with one (@paulaberman- Sofia Cossar) or several (@HBesso31 - Ryan Cwynar/Cami Arias/Anna Kaic) required team members.\n\nThis introduces a bit of a chicken-and-egg problem since the DAO is currently only authorized to hire employees individually (through the HIP-2 1) procedure but the applicants will only agree to be hired if they can have their team along. This proposal allows for the flexibility to accept such applications.\n\nIn addition, this proposal also creates a clear path towards a decision by regularly forcing a vote on whether we should move to a decision. This way we may keep the process open, but still signal to the applicants how close we are to being ready, giving a signal of how likely they are to get a decision.\n\nSpecification\nAmending HIP-2: This process is an exception to HIP-2 because it allows hiring by the onboarding plan. This exception should be added to HIP-2.\n\nApplication:\n\nA new thread is created for management onboarding or an existing one is designated for the purpose.\nA decision/re-evaluation decision is made through a snapshot poll.\nThe re-evaluation poll will be “Are we ready to decide on a PM?”, answers “Yes” or “No - extend 1/2/4/8/16 weeks”.\nIf the answer is No we will use the median value of the poll for the number of weeks for the next re-evaluation date (“Yes” counts as 0).\nIf the answer is “Yes” we will close for further applications.\nIf an application comes in during voting, a full week (from the time of the application) must be available for discussion of the new candidate before moving to the next phase.\nAn application must describe their Onboarding plan:\n\nHow to fill open positions (specific people or the process)\nAlternatively, that which open positions should be closed.\nA budget for operation for at least one year.\nA financing plan for at least one year.\nProposer Selection\n\nA 7-day vote is created with all applicants (their handle in Discourse) in random order. “Which is your preferred PM?” Answers (“Applicant 1”/“Applicant 2”/“Applicant 3”)\nThe applicant with the highest vote count will become the current “Proposer”.\nOnboarding:\n\nThe proposer will create a thread with the final onboarding plan which is allowed to be changed from the original application.\nThe Proposer must within one week create a snapshot poll with the title “[Binding] Onboard [Applicant Name]”.\nThe entire Onboarding plan must be pasted in the snapshot poll.\nOn rejection, the applicant with the next highest vote count becomes the new proposer and the application Onboarding phase is repeated.\nIf all candidates are rejected we reopen for the application phase.\nRationale\nThis process is a compromise between setting a deadline, which will allow candidates to plan their lives and keeping our options open. The candidates know when a re-evaluation occurs, and if we do not close for applications, at least they will get an indication of how close we were to closing and a new date giving them more feedback to plan.\n\nThe poll created by @paulaberman on whether to allow teams came back positive so this process allows for such a proposal. If you don’t like a team proposal, you are free to vote against it and/or vote to extend the application period if only team applications are in.\n\nI considered making the proposal repeal HIP-3, however, this is not needed. HIP-3 simply defines two open positions. If these open positions (not specifying full-/part-time) are incompatible with an applicant’s plan then the applicant must argue why these positions should be closed as part of the Onboarding plan.\n\nImplementation\nAny member can take the actions to advance the process as long as the requirements are fulfilled.",

However, this proposal would give them a formal mandate by the community and put a time limit before the board positions would become individually elected.\n\nSince the DAO does not yet have a robust mechanism for voting the second part of the proposal is that the current members filling this task from Kleros and Democracy.Earth will be formalized as the interim board for the period of 1 year after approval.\n\nMotivation\nAt the moment, the creators of the DAO have control of all resources as a trusted group. However, to have a democratic institution this power needs to be under democratic control. In addition, the employees of the DAO need to be treated consistently by the same group of people to ensure good working conditions.\n\nSpecification\nThe current informal managers, from Kleros and Democracy.Earth are formalized as the “Mission Board” for a period of 1 year after adoption.\n[complete list of people will be added for phase 3]\n\nThereafter elections should be held for the positions on the board before the end of the 1-year interim period.\n\nThe mission board will jointly manage the following:\n\nTechnical implementation of voting\nAccess to critical wallets.\nAccess right to funds by management\nPayment to employees\nAny resource requiring high trust by the community\nIn addition the board will\n\nAdvise management, administer their payment, and monitor their performance.\nAdjudicate if the proper procedure is followed on passing proposals.\nBe authorized to issue mission statements on behalf of the DAO.\nRationale\nThe proposal is meant to improve democratic control but not disrupt current operations. The role of the board is what is already being done by a trusted group or will be done in the near future. But this group would have some difficulty explaining their special role with no democratic mandate.\n\nWe could decide to elect a board immediately, but since we don’t yet have defined voting robust procedures we would run a serious risk of taking a lot of time with this and disrupting the progress on other fronts. This is why the option of elevating the current informal leaders to elected (accept/reject) status but for only 1 year.\n\n** Implementation **\nNothing really changes, except that elections must be held for the board positions before the year is out. If possible the board members should be marked as such on Discourse.",

      "content": "https://gov.proofofhumanity.id/t/hip-10-phase-2-signaling-create-a-decision-locking-mechanism/598\nHIP: 10\ntitle: Create a decision locking mechanism\nauthor: @Mads\nstatus: Signalling\ncreated: 2021-05-16\n\nAbstract\nThis proposal suggests creating a decision locking mechanism that will make decisions more difficult to reverse at a later date. This locking mechanism can either be applied to new or existing decisions.\n\nMotivation\nFor some decisions, we need to signal to the world and ourselves that they are very unlikely to be overturned in the future and that it would require a lot of effort to do so. One such decision would be to, for instance, lock the $UBI issuance rate to ensure that people can forecast the value of the currency, improving stability.\n\nSpecification\nThere would be three ways of creating a locked decision.\n\nIn a new proposal, you would need to add the word “Locking” to the proposal topic, and add a separate section in the proposal, arguing why this decision should be locked.\nFor an existing approved proposal, the decision can be locked by creating a new proposal to lock the earlier decision.\nAn existing locked decision can be put up for a new locking vote to increase the reversal threshold further. This new vote requires a separate proposal.\nIn a locking vote, a minimum of 60 % approval is needed, if the approval is less then the proposal fails completely.\n\nIf the locking threshold is exceeded then a reversal threshold is set. The reversal threshold will be the approval rate of the proposal, rounded down to the nearest 5 %. So a proposal passing at 74.5 % would later require a 70 % vote to repeal.\n\nIf the reversal threshold would be set to above 90 % by the above rule then it is instead set to 90 %.\n\nRationale\nThis implementation allows the community to make reversing a decision very hard - but not impossible. The difficulty of reversing a decision scales with the amount of agreement at an earlier time. Consideration was also to include a requirement that some quorum of voters must participate in the vote, but this was dropped since this would make the difficulty of reversing a decision too linked to user participation which may vary in unpredictable ways over time. The locking of the issuance rate is postponed, since creating a locking mechanism AND using it on something so central would be too much for one vote.",

      "content": "**Simple summary**\nMake clear that the definition of 360p does not literally mean 360 pixels, and that certain codecs crop 4 pixel columns from each side of the image. Submissions with 352 pixels wide should not be considered in violation with submission rules.\n\n**Abstract**\nThis amendment proposal is a fast, immediate solution to issues related to a widespread method of video submission… It moves the minimum dimension of the width or height of videos from 360 to 352 to match what is currently capable in the most widespread technology available. The 8 pixels removed cropped by the codec due to ancient PAL analogue norm is not moving the line too much and it fits the technical capability of current widespread technology. It is not realistic to challenge a person because 8 pixel columns are removed from the side of the picture (in the case that is background that is removed from the frame and not actual image). This amendment is final and it is not intended to serve precedent of moving the minimum any further than this.\n\n**Motivation**\nThe most common and easy way for a lay user to submit and transfer a video without additional installations or knowledge is sending it via WhatsApp and downloading it through WhatsApp web. In order to avoid opportunistic challengers that predate in these submissions, that would otherwise be a good-faith submission, an urgent amendment to this policy should be put in place. It would also lift some artificial and clunky methods that current new users are using that degrades the platform in order to meet the requirements (re-encoding video, padding to sides of it, etc.).\n\n**Specification**\nMinimum video dimensions is a square of 352 pixels by 352 pixels. Videos with equal or higher size than stated should not be considered a violation to the rule #4 of submission guidelines. Videos equaling 351 pixels or lower in size in any of their dimensions will violate rule #4.\n\nThis is an interim resolution until more precise video quality submission guidelines are approved.\n\n**Implementation**\nChange the text of rule number #4, replacing this block of text:\n\n    The video quality should be at least 360p, at most 2 minutes long, and in the video/webm, video/MP4, video/avi or video/mov format.\n\nWith this block of text:\n\n    Video submissions must follow all of the following requirements:\n\n       * at most 2 minutes long,\n       * in the video/webm, video/MP4, video/avi or video/mov format,\n       * vertical (portrait), horizontal (landscape) or square,\n\n    and follow these minimum size requirements:\n\n       * Minimum height: equal to or higher than 352 pixels\n       * Minimum width: equal to or higher than 352 pixels\n\n\n\n**Rationale**\nRefer to [Imprecise rule regarding video quality of submissions ](https://gov.proofofhumanity.id/t/imprecise-rule-regarding-video-quality-of-submissions/443)\n\n**Supplementary information**\nSee also forum discussion in https://gov.proofofhumanity.id/t/hip-8-phase-3-accept-352-as-minimum-dimension-in-video-submissions/536\n\n[Link a versión en español](https://gov.proofofhumanity.id/t/hip-8-phase-3-accept-352-as-minimum-dimension-in-video-submissions/536/22?u=ludovico)",

      "content": "[Link to HIP-5 proposal thread](https://gov.proofofhumanity.id/t/hip-5-adopt-a-proper-poh-dao-governance-process-to-ensure-hip-quality/393)\n\n### Simple Summary\n\nThis proposal details a process for creating PoH DAO governance proposals and putting them up to vote.\n\n### Abstract\n\nThis proposal provides a detailed structured process for PoH DAO governance proposals. Any individual or entity wishing to create a proposal and put it up to vote will need to go through those steps to ensure that its proposal is detailed enough to be voted on and its implementation enforceable.\n\n### Motivation\n\nThe recent proposals on [PoH Snapshot page](https://snapshot.org/#/poh.eth) confused a lot of people in the PoH community. They lack any detailed description, link to a debate on PoH forum, proper structuring of the proposal and it is not clear if they are only for collecting signalling information or if they will be binding. Moreover, some of them invite people to vote on proposals that may not be technically feasible. This proposal will ensure only proposals and polls with the bare minimum quality will reach the snapshot page and avoid voter fatigue in the process.\n\n### Specification\n\n## PoH DAO Governance Process\n\nThe Proof of Humanity governance process is primarily conducted using the [DAO category](https://gov.proofofhumanity.id/c/democracy/7) on the Proof of Humanity Governance Forum. For a proposal to be accepted, it must successfully pass through three phases:\n\n# Phase 1: Ideation\n\nThis phase facilitates an initial, informal discussion on PoH Forum regarding potential proposals to PoH DAO. You can initiate a proposal in Phase 1 by posting your idea in the[ DAO category](https://gov.proofofhumanity.id/c/democracy/7) with the phase-1 tag. This phase allows proposals to gather community insight for refinement before opening a formal poll.\n\n**Duration:** Open-ended\n\n**Passing Requirement:** For proposals to successfully pass from Phase 1 to Phase 2, there is no formal requirement. However, if a Phase 1 proposal discussion fails to garner any momentum from the community, it is unlikely to become a successful proposal.\n\n# Phase 2: Specification\n\nThis phase requires proposals to be posted in a new dedicated thread the [DAO category](https://gov.proofofhumanity.id/c/democracy/7) using the Humanity Improvement Proposal (HIP) template. You can create a Humanity Improvement Proposal (HIP) easily by adding the HIP subcategory, after which your draft post will automatically be populated by a HIP template for you to fill in. You can move a proposal to Phase 2 by posting the HIP-# with the phase-2 tag.\n\nThe HIP template recommends that all proposals should contain the following fields when applicable , such as a Simple Summary, Abstract, Motivation and Specification.\nIn addition to these fields, Phase 2 proposals must also include a link to a 5-day long signalling poll on PoH Snapshot page about the proposal outcome (that contains the proposal text as well as a link to the HIP post on the PoH Forum), and it must include the option Make no changes. The Phase 2 proposal poll on Snapshot **should be prefixed by [Signalling]** to differentiate them from binding Phase 3 proposal votes*. In order to be eligible to signal in the poll, community members must be registered in the PoH registry.\n\n>   *In the near future, if we are able to create polls on the forum only open to Discourse accounts linked to a PoH profile, then the signalling poll could be done on the forum.\n\n**Duration:** 3 days\n\n**Passing Requirement:** For proposals to successfully pass from Phase 2 to Phase 3, there must be one outcome with a relative majority of votes on the forum poll. If the relative majority of votes on the forum poll indicates the result Make no changes, the proposal will not pass to Phase 3.\n\n# Phase 3: Consensus\n\nThis phase opens proposals to two signalling methods for token holders. You can move a proposal to Phase 3 by editing the HIP post from the previous phase to reflect the snapshot signalling poll result that received a relative majority of votes and by updating the proposal’s tag to phase-3. This serves to refine the proposal for the final phase.\n\nAdditionally, a PoH DAO proposal on Snapshot page must be created (that contains the proposal text as well as a link to the HIP post on the PoH Forum), **it should be prefixed by [Binding]** and it must include the option Make no changes. In order to be eligible to vote for the proposal, community members must be registered in the PoH registry.\n\n**Duration:** 7 days\n\n**Passing Requirement:** For proposals to be accepted in this final phase, there must be one outcome with a relative majority of votes in the Snapshot proposal. If the relative majority of votes on the proposal indicates the result Make no changes, the proposal will not be accepted and considered closed.\n\nAny snapshot proposal not following these guidelines can be considered non-binding.\n\nMany thanks to teams in the ecosystem including Gnosis, Balancer and Uniswap, which inspired this governance process.\n\n# HIP Template\n\n    HIP: <Number to be assigned>\n    title: <HIP title>\n    author: <a list of the author's or authors' name(s) and/or username(s), or name(s) and email(s),\n    status: Draft\n    created: <date created on, in ISO 8601 (yyyy-mm-dd) format>\n    requires (*optional): <HIP number(s)>\n    replaces (*optional): <HIP number(s)>\n\n### Simple Summary\n\n(Required for Phase 1)\n\nIf you can’t explain it simply, you don’t understand it well enough. Provide a simplified and layman-accessible explanation of the HIP.\n\n### Abstract\n\n(Required for Phase 1)\n\nA short (~200 word) description of the issue being addressed.\n\n### Motivation\n\n(Required for Phase 1)\n\nThe motivation is critical for HIPs that want to allocate funding or change the PoH DAO. HIP posts without sufficient motivation may be rejected outright.\n\n### Specification\n\n(Required for Phase 2)\n\nThe technical specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature. The specification should be detailed enough to allow for it to be reasoned about by participants in the PoH DAO.\n\n### Rationale\n\n(Recommended for Phase 2)\n\nThe rationale fleshes out the specification by describing what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered and related work. The rationale may also provide evidence of consensus within the community, and should discuss important objections or concerns raised during discussion.\n\n### Implementation\n\n(If necessary, recommended for Phase 3)",

      "content": "Simple summary\nMake clear that the definition of 360p does not literally mean 360 pixels, and that certain codecs crop 4 pixels from each side of the image. Submissions with 352 pixels wide should not be considered in violation with submission rules.\n\nAbstract\nThis amendment proposal is a fast, immediate solution to issues related to a widespread method of video submission. It moves the minimum dimension of the width of vertical videos from 360 to 352 to match what is currently capable in the most widespread technology available. The 8 pixels removed cropped by the codec due to ancient PAL analogue norm is not moving the line too much and it fits the technical capability of current widespread technology. It is not realistic to challenge a person because 8 pixels are removed from the side of the picture (in the case that is background that is removed from the frame and not actual image). It is not intended to move the line any further than that.\n\nMotivation\nThe most common and easy way for a lay user to submit and transfer a video without additional installations or knowledge is sending it via WhatsApp and downloading it through WhatsApp web. In order to avoid opportunistic challengers that predate in these submissions, that would otherwise be a good-faith submission, an urgent ammendment to this policy should be put in place. It would also lift some artificial and clunky methods that current new users are using that degrades the platform in order to meet the requirements (re-encoding video, padding to sides of it, etc.).\n\nSpecification\nIf a vertical video in the proportion 16:9 is submitted vertically, then the 352 pixels of width should not be considered a violation to the rule #4 of submission guidelines, since it is still considered 360p.\n\nRationale\nRefer to Imprecise rule regarding video quality of submissions (https://gov.proofofhumanity.id/t/imprecise-rule-regarding-video-quality-of-submissions/443)",

Humans are skilled at managing complexity and dealing with tough moral issues.\n\nNot using this capacity in this platform's structure exposes the platform to significant long-term risks from bots, etc. We must design this platform that leverages human strengths and mitigates for human weaknesses.\n\nAt the moment there are lots of system costs for human error in submissions when human error is actually a very robust way of proving that people are human.\n\nIn terms of an overlying principle for jurors, this principle is suggesting that they must be able to prove beyond reasonable doubt that a submission is not human whether or not a submission is perfectly submitted or not.\n\nWhilst this may a scary decision from a technical point of view as the developer community in particular likes to have decisions that are black and white we must move beyond that to leverage the collective processing power of the humans in the system.",

This proposal gives some procedure for the recruitments made by the DAO.\n\n# Proposal\n\nThe recruitment process for positions offered by the DAO is as follows:\n\n1. Candidates submits an initial proposal which contains:\n\n* A resume.\n* A brief writing explaining why they would like to work for the DAO and why they think they would be a great fit.\n* The % of their working time they propose to allocate to the DAO, the requested compensation and its yearly equivalent full time. Ex: 50% for 6 months for a total pay of 25k$ (100k$ of yearly equivalent full time).\n\n2. Candidates have a first interview with volunteers among people already working for the DAO (directly or indirectly).\n3. Volunteers ask candidates to complete one recruiting exercise.\n4. Volunteers indicate privately to the candidate the recommendation they would give to the DAO about the candidate (strong reject, weak reject, neutral, weak accept or strong accept). Candidates can then either allow those to become public or withdraw their application. They also have the possibility to readjust the requested compensation.\n5. Volunteers make those recommendation public.\n6. A recruitment proposal is put to vote.\n\nOnce a worker proposal is accepted, it’s paid monthly for all its duration. In case of under-performance, or budget restriction, the DAO can terminate contracts with a 2 week notice which starts counting from the end of the vote.\nWorkers can stop working within the same notice period but it is advised that they inform the DAO ahead of time and work to find a suitable replacement.\nThe DAO doesn’t monitor worker time, it only cares about productivity and assumes that an equivalent full-time is made of 226 days of work (365 days per year - 2*52 for weekends - 35 for holidays).",

Users that are spending gas to vouch for other humans, will be rewarded with more UBI than those that are not contributing to the growth of Proof of Humanity.\n\nTaking into consideration that the current accrual rate is `0.00028 UBI per second` (or `1.00 UBI per hour`), users will be able to earn the full rate if they vouch for at least one human in Proof of Humanity. If a user has never vouched for someone, she can still accrue UBI but at a fraction of the full accrual rate. We suggest to lower the accrual to 1/10th the rate (ie. `0.10 UBI per hour`).\n\n# Development\n\nThe UBI token contract will be upgraded with a new interface to Proof of Humanity that will have the ability to call `getSubmissionInfo` and obtain for a given address if it has vouched or not for someone else using the `hasVouched` boolean value returned by Proof of Humanity. \n\n```\ninterface IProofOfHumanity {\n  function isRegistered(address _submissionID)\n    external\n    view\n    returns (\n      bool registered\n    );\n   function getSubmissionInfo(address _submissionID)\n     external\n     view\n     returns (\n       bool status,\n       uint submissionTime, \n       uint index, \n       bool registered, \n       bool hasVouched, // value used for accrual rate\n       uint numberOfRequests\n     )\n}\n```\n\nThe `getAccruedValue` function  that is called by `balanceOf` will then take into consideration if a given address has vouched or not and set the accrual rate based on this data.\n\n# Considerations\n\nThis will mitigate inflation of the UBI token during its initial phase and reward participants in the network that are effectively contributing to its growth.\n\nUsers that have accrued UBI before this modification will have to transfer their funds to a new address to keep their accrued UBI, or else their accrued UBI so far will be impacted by the new formula if they haven't vouched for anyone yet.\n",
