      "content": "This proposal is a collaboration between the team behind Project Omega (working title) and the core contributors of Akropolis. We welcome feedback and engagement, both on the forum and directly to us, about this proposal and how it can drive success for Akropolis and $AKRO.\n\nSummary\nThis proposal puts forward a plan to reinvigorate the Akropolis project, enable it to incentivise new and old contributors, support the funding of a product roadmap aiming to revolutionise the Bitcoin ecosystem, and ultimately, accrue value to $AKRO token holders by encapturing a wider range of use cases.\n\nThis proposal outlines and puts forward:\n\nNew contributors and key new product initiative with Project Omega\nNew token economics for $AKRO\nNew project roadmap\nBackground\nAkropolis transitioned to a DAO two years ago 6 in 2022, and handed over the contribution initiatives to the community. However, since then, community contribution has been extremely limited if any, for various reasons. They key reason being misaligned incentives for participation in the broader DeFi ecosystem\n\n$AKRO’s current circulation is 88% of the maximum supply, with limited treasury reserves remaining to incentivise future growth via new core contributors. This makes it impossible to fund a viable roadmap for product development and build a suitable marketing budget. Without a thoughtful restructuring of Akropolis and $AKRO, the protocol’s future is unquestionably limited.\n\nProposal\nTo address this, core Akropolis contributors and a new core contributor candidate team have joined forces to put forward the following remedial plan for the future of Akropolis:\n\nIntroduction of the proposed Project Omega roadmap, a BTC UTXO sidechain with enhanced EVM compatibility\nProgress to date on Project Omega’s development\nAn $AKRO token restructuring to enable and fund the new product roadmap;\nToken model restructuring to enable move from a dApp token to a new L1/L0 native utility token that secures the chain.",

It would not require a lot of work, since Liquity provides all the tools to implement this solution.\n\nWhat is the benefit for Akropolis?\nAkropolis platform can earn commissions for providing access to Liquity through its frontend - starting from 0.1% of the loan issuance fee.\n\nScope of work:\nLiquity integration:\n- Creating a module for interaction with the contract;\n- Form for creating and closing a Trove - a layout and connecting logic;\n- LQTY staking module;\n- Stability pool module;\n- Transaction History;\n- Token cards for the yield calculator page;\n- General information about the protocol + information about the user’s balance, etc. within the protocol;\n\nFrontend optimization:\n- Adding a proxy service that proxies requests to the node, collects them into sets of 10 and sends them out, with the research of possibility to use various Alchemy keys.\n\nTime needed: up to 33 working days for Liquity integration and 4 days for frontend optimization; around 37 working days in total.\n\nTotal Costs: $9065\n",

All emissions will be distributed under a defined schedule and utilized for purposes including talent and partner acquisition, liquidity retention and yield generation.\n\nThis proposal has been created with careful consideration for existing and future Akropolis users and AKRO token holders. Its motivation is rooted in the ongoing success of Akropolis and the subsequent value accrual to AKRO.\n\nNote that if this proposal does not go through, staking rewards will need to be discontinued and there will be no further incentive programs for any product from January 2022.\n\nNumbers\nA total of 1,000,000,000 AKRO (25% from Total Token Supply) tokens will be minted and gradually brought into circulation over a 4 year period. This is a 25% increase of the current total supply, which would result in a new total supply of 5,000,000,000 AKRO.\n\nIf passed, this proposal will:\n- Increase the maximum supply of the AKRO token under a predictable emission schedule. This will allow Akropolis to:\n-- Initiate the active use - and further diversification - of the Treasury;\nIntroduce new revenue streams for AKRO stakers;\n-- Alter the mechanics of AKRO staking to promote long-term alignment of the DAO with the aims of the protocol;\n-- Attract and retain key talent and protocol partnerships;\n-- Establish new liquidity mining and staking reward programs.\n- Grant the Team the power to manage the Treasury as they see fit during the transition to a DAO.\n\nSee the full proposal on the governance forum:\nhttps://gov.akropolis.io/t/aip-012-inflation-safeguarding-the-future",

      "content": "Proposal Origins\nA few weeks back, AKRO token holders approached the core team with the idea of AIP008 after their independent discussions. After the proposal was published, another community member came up with AIP-009 as an alternative proposal.\n\nProposals TLDR\n- AIP-008 proposes to reduce swap rate among all ADEL origination sources from 1:15 to 1:3.1, which would leave around 170M AKRO for LM, community initiatives, etc. In this case, vesting would be reduced to one year instead of two.\n- AIP-009 16 takes into account feedback received on AIP008 and proposes to reduce swap rate only for the ADEL rewards accrued before Jan 6, thus leaving the potential LM & community fund with around 80M AKRO. Vesting won’t be changed and will remain 2 years.\n- In order to allow everyone to swap in time after changes of the winning option are implemented, we will be prolonging swap duration until June 15, with vesting starting on July 1.\n- All AKRO excluded from swap will be used for LM, community grants, etc. and will be put into the public contract, giving the community the ability to check how AKRO are used - with possibility to govern LM & community grants in future.\n\nVote\nThe vote itself will be to choose between AIP008 & AIP009 and will continue for a week. Once the voting is completed, changes would be implemented in accordance with the winning option. \n\nLink to governance forum - https://gov.akropolis.io/t/aip-010-thoughts-on-the-aip008-009-from-the-akropolis-team/440\n",
