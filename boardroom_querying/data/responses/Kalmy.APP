It provides a secure platform for communities to demonstrate their collective strength and earn rewards for their engagement.\n\n### What does this mean for KALM token holders?\n\nKALM is more than just a token; it's the driving force behind the Kalmy ecosystem and represents the voice of our community. Whether you're holding, staking, or locking your KALM tokens, you're in control of the ecosystemâ€™s direction.\n\n### How do you make sure that everyone has a voice?\n\nIn the crypto world, voting power often correlates with wealth. While we steer clear of politics, we firmly believe that every voice must be heard.\n\nTo address this, we offer a locking option for committed members who wish to amplify their influence in Kalmy's governance. By locking your KALM tokens, you can significantly increase your voting power. This power scales with the duration of the lock, ranging from 1 to 208 weeks, potentially multiplying your voting power by up to 208 times.\n\nDiscover more about the voting process in our [voting documentation](https://docs.kalmar.io/use-your-kalm-tokens/voting) and learn about the locking mechanism in our [locking documentation](https://docs.kalmar.io/use-your-kalm-tokens/kalm-locking).\n\n---\n\n- [Visit our Website](https://kalmy.app/)\n- [Follow us on Twitter (X)](https://twitter.com/KalmyAPP)\n- [DeFi Wars - Vault Request Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfkMvHdxRexs8kt_ACmUCY66nY_BgV9ZpVKA5IT4I6-BNkm-Q/viewform?usp=sf_link)",

The results will be visible within [Kalmy.app](https://kalmy.app/) starting Monday.\n\nYour KALM, your decision.\n\n### What are DeFi Wars?\n\nDeFi Wars are a governance system where communities can use their KALM voting power to participate in weekly votes, deciding which vault or staking pool gets the most rewards for the upcoming week.\n\nThis system empowers projects to offer more incentives to their token holders and liquidity providers. It provides a secure platform for communities to demonstrate their collective strength and earn rewards for their engagement.\n\n### What does this mean for KALM token holders?\n\nKALM is more than just a token; it's the driving force behind the Kalmy ecosystem and represents the voice of our community. Whether you're holding, staking, or locking your KALM tokens, you're in control of the ecosystemâ€™s direction.\n\n### How do you make sure that everyone has a voice?\n\nIn the crypto world, voting power often correlates with wealth. While we steer clear of politics, we firmly believe that every voice must be heard.\n\nTo address this, we offer a locking option for committed members who wish to amplify their influence in Kalmy's governance. By locking your KALM tokens, you can significantly increase your voting power. This power scales with the duration of the lock, ranging from 1 to 208 weeks, potentially multiplying your voting power by up to 208 times.\n\nDiscover more about the voting process in our [voting documentation](https://docs.kalmar.io/use-your-kalm-tokens/voting) and learn about the locking mechanism in our [locking documentation](https://docs.kalmar.io/use-your-kalm-tokens/kalm-locking).\n\n---\n\n- [Visit our Website](https://kalmy.app/)\n- [Follow us on Twitter (X)](https://twitter.com/KalmyAPP)\n- [DeFi Wars - Vault Request Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfkMvHdxRexs8kt_ACmUCY66nY_BgV9ZpVKA5IT4I6-BNkm-Q/viewform?usp=sf_link)",

The results will be visible within [Kalmy.app](https://kalmy.app/) starting Monday.\n\nYour KALM, your decision.\n\n### What are DeFi Wars?\n\nDeFi Wars are a governance system where communities can use their KALM voting power to participate in weekly votes, deciding which vault or staking pool gets the most rewards for the upcoming week.\n\nThis system empowers projects to offer more incentives to their token holders and liquidity providers. It provides a secure platform for communities to demonstrate their collective strength and earn rewards for their engagement.\n\n### What does this mean for KALM token holders?\n\nKALM is more than just a token; it's the driving force behind the Kalmy ecosystem and represents the voice of our community. Whether you're holding, staking, or locking your KALM tokens, you're in control of the ecosystemâ€™s direction.\n\n### How do you make sure that everyone has a voice?\n\nIn the crypto world, voting power often correlates with wealth. While we steer clear of politics, we firmly believe that every voice must be heard.\n\nTo address this, we offer a locking option for committed members who wish to amplify their influence in Kalmy's governance. By locking your KALM tokens, you can significantly increase your voting power. This power scales with the duration of the lock, ranging from 1 to 208 weeks, potentially multiplying your voting power by up to 208 times.\n\nDiscover more about the voting process in our [voting documentation](https://docs.kalmar.io/use-your-kalm-tokens/voting) and learn about the locking mechanism in our [locking documentation](https://docs.kalmar.io/use-your-kalm-tokens/kalm-locking).\n\n---\n\n- [Visit our Website](https://kalmy.app/)\n- [Follow us on Twitter (X)](https://twitter.com/KalmyAPP)\n- [DeFi Wars - Vault Request Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfkMvHdxRexs8kt_ACmUCY66nY_BgV9ZpVKA5IT4I6-BNkm-Q/viewform?usp=sf_link)",

The results will be visible within [Kalmy.app](https://kalmy.app/) starting Monday.\n\nYour KALM, your decision.\n\n### What are NFT wars?\n\nNFT Wars are a governance system where communities can use their KALM voting power to participate in weekly votes, deciding which pool gets the most rewards for the upcoming week.\n\nThis system empowers projects to offer more incentives to their token holders. It provides a secure platform for communities to demonstrate their collective strength and earn rewards for their engagement.\n\n### What does this mean for KALM token holders?\n\nKALM is more than just a token; it's the driving force behind the Kalmy ecosystem and represents the voice of our community. Whether you're holding, staking, or locking your KALM tokens, you're in control of the ecosystemâ€™s direction.\n\n### How do you make sure that everyone has a voice?\n\nIn the crypto world, voting power often correlates with wealth. While we steer clear of politics, we firmly believe that every voice must be heard.\n\nTo address this, we offer a locking option for committed members who wish to amplify their influence in Kalmy's governance. By locking your KALM tokens, you can significantly increase your voting power. This power scales with the duration of the lock, ranging from 1 to 208 weeks, potentially multiplying your voting power by up to 208 times.\n\nDiscover more about the voting process in our [voting documentation](https://docs.kalmar.io/use-your-kalm-tokens/voting) and learn about the locking mechanism in our [locking documentation](https://docs.kalmar.io/use-your-kalm-tokens/kalm-locking).\n\n---\n\n- [Visit our Website](https://kalmy.app/)\n- [Follow us on Twitter (X)](https://twitter.com/KalmyAPP)\n- [NFT Wars - Vault Request Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdqQofUcwxICZdZqx_ZISCnbjGpKxkI2IxgKU9P86kMeTlpWg/viewform?usp=sf_link)",

By locking your KALM tokens, you can significantly increase your voting power. This power scales with the duration of the lock, ranging from 1 to 208 weeks, potentially multiplying your voting power by up to 208 times.\n\nDiscover more about the voting process in our [voting documentation](https://docs.kalmar.io/use-your-kalm-tokens/voting) and learn about the locking mechanism in our [locking documentation](https://docs.kalmar.io/use-your-kalm-tokens/kalm-locking).\n\n---\n\n- [Visit our Website](https://kalmy.app/)\n- [Follow us on Twitter (X)](https://twitter.com/KalmyAPP)\n- [NFT Wars - Vault Request Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdqQofUcwxICZdZqx_ZISCnbjGpKxkI2IxgKU9P86kMeTlpWg/viewform?usp=sf_link)",

The results will be visible within [Kalmy.app](https://kalmy.app/) starting Monday.\n\nYour KALM, your decision.\n\n### What are DeFi Wars?\n\nDeFi Wars are a governance system where communities can use their KALM voting power to participate in weekly votes, deciding which vault or staking pool gets the most rewards for the upcoming week.\n\nThis system empowers projects to offer more incentives to their token holders and liquidity providers. It provides a secure platform for communities to demonstrate their collective strength and earn rewards for their engagement.\n\n### What does this mean for KALM token holders?\n\nKALM is more than just a token; it's the driving force behind the Kalmy ecosystem and represents the voice of our community. Whether you're holding, staking, or locking your KALM tokens, you're in control of the ecosystemâ€™s direction.\n\n### How do you make sure that everyone has a voice?\n\nIn the crypto world, voting power often correlates with wealth. While we steer clear of politics, we firmly believe that every voice must be heard.\n\nTo address this, we offer a locking option for committed members who wish to amplify their influence in Kalmy's governance.

The results will be visible within [Kalmy.app](https://kalmy.app/) starting Monday.\n\nYour KALM, your decision.\n\n### What are DeFi Wars?\n\nDeFi Wars are a governance system where communities can use their KALM voting power to participate in weekly votes, deciding which vault or staking pool gets the most rewards for the upcoming week.\n\nThis system empowers projects to offer more incentives to their token holders and liquidity providers. It provides a secure platform for communities to demonstrate their collective strength and earn rewards for their engagement.\n\n### What does this mean for KALM token holders?\n\nKALM is more than just a token; it's the driving force behind the Kalmy ecosystem and represents the voice of our community. Whether you're holding, staking, or locking your KALM tokens, you're in control of the ecosystemâ€™s direction.\n\n### How do you make sure that everyone has a voice?\n\nIn the crypto world, voting power often correlates with wealth. While we steer clear of politics, we firmly believe that every voice must be heard.\n\nTo address this, we offer a locking option for committed members who wish to amplify their influence in Kalmy's governance. By locking your KALM tokens, you can significantly increase your voting power. This power scales with the duration of the lock, ranging from 1 to 208 weeks, potentially multiplying your voting power by up to 208 times.\n\nDiscover more about the voting process in our [voting documentation](https://docs.kalmar.io/use-your-kalm-tokens/voting) and learn about the locking mechanism in our [locking documentation](https://docs.kalmar.io/use-your-kalm-tokens/kalm-locking).\n\n---\n\n- [Visit our Website](https://kalmy.app/)\n- [Follow us on Twitter (X)](https://twitter.com/KalmyAPP)\n- [DeFi Wars - Vault Request Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfkMvHdxRexs8kt_ACmUCY66nY_BgV9ZpVKA5IT4I6-BNkm-Q/viewform?usp=sf_link)",

The results will be visible within [Kalmy.app](https://kalmy.app/) starting Monday.\n\nYour KALM, your decision.\n\n### What are DeFi Wars?\n\nDeFi Wars are a governance system where communities can use their KALM voting power to participate in weekly votes, deciding which vault or staking pool gets the most rewards for the upcoming week.\n\nThis system empowers projects to offer more incentives to their token holders and liquidity providers. It provides a secure platform for communities to demonstrate their collective strength and earn rewards for their engagement.\n\n### What does this mean for KALM token holders?\n\nKALM is more than just a token; it's the driving force behind the Kalmy ecosystem and represents the voice of our community. Whether you're holding, staking, or locking your KALM tokens, you're in control of the ecosystemâ€™s direction.\n\n### How do you make sure that everyone has a voice?\n\nIn the crypto world, voting power often correlates with wealth. While we steer clear of politics, we firmly believe that every voice must be heard.\n\nTo address this, we offer a locking option for committed members who wish to amplify their influence in Kalmy's governance. By locking your KALM tokens, you can significantly increase your voting power. This power scales with the duration of the lock, ranging from 1 to 208 weeks, potentially multiplying your voting power by up to 208 times.\n\nDiscover more about the voting process in our [voting documentation](https://docs.kalmar.io/use-your-kalm-tokens/voting) and learn about the locking mechanism in our [locking documentation](https://docs.kalmar.io/use-your-kalm-tokens/kalm-locking).\n\n---\n\n- [Visit our Website](https://kalmy.app/)\n- [Follow us on Twitter (X)](https://twitter.com/KalmyAPP)\n- [DeFi Wars - Vault Request Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfkMvHdxRexs8kt_ACmUCY66nY_BgV9ZpVKA5IT4I6-BNkm-Q/viewform?usp=sf_link)",

The results will be visible within [Kalmy.app](https://kalmy.app/) starting Monday.\n\nYour KALM, your decision.\n\n### What are DeFi Wars?\n\nDeFi Wars are a governance system where communities can use their KALM voting power to participate in weekly votes, deciding which vault or staking pool gets the most rewards for the upcoming week.\n\nThis system empowers projects to offer more incentives to their token holders and liquidity providers. It provides a secure platform for communities to demonstrate their collective strength and earn rewards for their engagement.\n\n### What does this mean for KALM token holders?\n\nKALM is more than just a token; it's the driving force behind the Kalmy ecosystem and represents the voice of our community. Whether you're holding, staking, or locking your KALM tokens, you're in control of the ecosystemâ€™s direction.\n\n### How do you make sure that everyone has a voice?\n\nIn the crypto world, voting power often correlates with wealth. While we steer clear of politics, we firmly believe that every voice must be heard.\n\nTo address this, we offer a locking option for committed members who wish to amplify their influence in Kalmy's governance. By locking your KALM tokens, you can significantly increase your voting power. This power scales with the duration of the lock, ranging from 1 to 208 weeks, potentially multiplying your voting power by up to 208 times.\n\nDiscover more about the voting process in our [voting documentation](https://docs.kalmar.io/use-your-kalm-tokens/voting) and learn about the locking mechanism in our [locking documentation](https://docs.kalmar.io/use-your-kalm-tokens/kalm-locking).\n\n---\n\n- [Visit our Website](https://kalmy.app/)\n- [Follow us on Twitter (X)](https://twitter.com/KalmyAPP)\n- [DeFi Wars - Vault Request Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfkMvHdxRexs8kt_ACmUCY66nY_BgV9ZpVKA5IT4I6-BNkm-Q/viewform?usp=sf_link)",

The results will be visible within [Kalmy.app](https://kalmy.app/) starting Monday.\n\nYour KALM, your decision.\n\n### What are DeFi Wars?\n\nDeFi Wars are a governance system where communities can use their KALM voting power to participate in weekly votes, deciding which vault or staking pool gets the most rewards for the upcoming week.\n\nThis system empowers projects to offer more incentives to their token holders and liquidity providers. It provides a secure platform for communities to demonstrate their collective strength and earn rewards for their engagement.\n\n### What does this mean for KALM token holders?\n\nKALM is more than just a token; it's the driving force behind the Kalmy ecosystem and represents the voice of our community. Whether you're holding, staking, or locking your KALM tokens, you're in control of the ecosystemâ€™s direction.\n\n### How do you make sure that everyone has a voice?\n\nIn the crypto world, voting power often correlates with wealth. While we steer clear of politics, we firmly believe that every voice must be heard.\n\nTo address this, we offer a locking option for committed members who wish to amplify their influence in Kalmy's governance. By locking your KALM tokens, you can significantly increase your voting power. This power scales with the duration of the lock, ranging from 1 to 208 weeks, potentially multiplying your voting power by up to 208 times.\n\nDiscover more about the voting process in our [voting documentation](https://docs.kalmar.io/use-your-kalm-tokens/voting) and learn about the locking mechanism in our [locking documentation](https://docs.kalmar.io/use-your-kalm-tokens/kalm-locking).\n\n---\n\n- [Visit our Website](https://kalmy.app/)\n- [Follow us on Twitter (X)](https://twitter.com/KalmyAPP)\n- [DeFi Wars - Vault Request Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfkMvHdxRexs8kt_ACmUCY66nY_BgV9ZpVKA5IT4I6-BNkm-Q/viewform?usp=sf_link)",

The results will be visible within [Kalmy.app](https://kalmy.app/) starting Monday.\n\nYour KALM, your decision.\n\n### What are NFT wars?\n\nNFT Wars are a governance system where communities can use their KALM voting power to participate in weekly votes, deciding which pool gets the most rewards for the upcoming week.\n\nThis system empowers projects to offer more incentives to their token holders. It provides a secure platform for communities to demonstrate their collective strength and earn rewards for their engagement.\n\n### What does this mean for KALM token holders?\n\nKALM is more than just a token; it's the driving force behind the Kalmy ecosystem and represents the voice of our community. Whether you're holding, staking, or locking your KALM tokens, you're in control of the ecosystemâ€™s direction.\n\n### How do you make sure that everyone has a voice?\n\nIn the crypto world, voting power often correlates with wealth. While we steer clear of politics, we firmly believe that every voice must be heard.\n\nTo address this, we offer a locking option for committed members who wish to amplify their influence in Kalmy's governance. By locking your KALM tokens, you can significantly increase your voting power. This power scales with the duration of the lock, ranging from 1 to 208 weeks, potentially multiplying your voting power by up to 208 times.\n\nDiscover more about the voting process in our [voting documentation](https://docs.kalmar.io/use-your-kalm-tokens/voting) and learn about the locking mechanism in our [locking documentation](https://docs.kalmar.io/use-your-kalm-tokens/kalm-locking).\n\n---\n\n- [Visit our Website](https://kalmy.app/)\n- [Follow us on Twitter (X)](https://twitter.com/KalmyAPP)\n- [NFT Wars - Vault Request Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdqQofUcwxICZdZqx_ZISCnbjGpKxkI2IxgKU9P86kMeTlpWg/viewform?usp=sf_link)",

The results will be visible within [Kalmy.app](https://kalmy.app/) starting Monday.\n\nYour KALM, your decision.\n\n### What are DeFi Wars?\n\nDeFi Wars are a governance system where communities can use their KALM voting power to participate in weekly votes, deciding which vault or staking pool gets the most rewards for the upcoming week.\n\nThis system empowers projects to offer more incentives to their token holders and liquidity providers. It provides a secure platform for communities to demonstrate their collective strength and earn rewards for their engagement.\n\n### What does this mean for KALM token holders?\n\nKALM is more than just a token; it's the driving force behind the Kalmy ecosystem and represents the voice of our community. Whether you're holding, staking, or locking your KALM tokens, you're in control of the ecosystemâ€™s direction.\n\n### How do you make sure that everyone has a voice?\n\nIn the crypto world, voting power often correlates with wealth. While we steer clear of politics, we firmly believe that every voice must be heard.\n\nTo address this, we offer a locking option for committed members who wish to amplify their influence in Kalmy's governance. By locking your KALM tokens, you can significantly increase your voting power. This power scales with the duration of the lock, ranging from 1 to 208 weeks, potentially multiplying your voting power by up to 208 times.\n\nDiscover more about the voting process in our [voting documentation](https://docs.kalmar.io/use-your-kalm-tokens/voting) and learn about the locking mechanism in our [locking documentation](https://docs.kalmar.io/use-your-kalm-tokens/kalm-locking).\n\n---\n\n- [Visit our Website](https://kalmy.app/)\n- [Follow us on Twitter (X)](https://twitter.com/KalmyAPP)\n- [DeFi Wars - Vault Request Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfkMvHdxRexs8kt_ACmUCY66nY_BgV9ZpVKA5IT4I6-BNkm-Q/viewform?usp=sf_link)",

The results will be visible within [Kalmy.app](https://kalmy.app/) starting Monday.\n\nYour KALM, your decision.\n\n### What are DeFi Wars?\n\nDeFi Wars are a governance system where communities can use their KALM voting power to participate in weekly votes, deciding which vault or staking pool gets the most rewards for the upcoming week.\n\nThis system empowers projects to offer more incentives to their token holders and liquidity providers. It provides a secure platform for communities to demonstrate their collective strength and earn rewards for their engagement.\n\n### What does this mean for KALM token holders?\n\nKALM is more than just a token; it's the driving force behind the Kalmy ecosystem and represents the voice of our community. Whether you're holding, staking, or locking your KALM tokens, you're in control of the ecosystemâ€™s direction.\n\n### How do you make sure that everyone has a voice?\n\nIn the crypto world, voting power often correlates with wealth. While we steer clear of politics, we firmly believe that every voice must be heard.\n\nTo address this, we offer a locking option for committed members who wish to amplify their influence in Kalmy's governance. By locking your KALM tokens, you can significantly increase your voting power. This power scales with the duration of the lock, ranging from 1 to 208 weeks, potentially multiplying your voting power by up to 208 times.\n\nDiscover more about the voting process in our [voting documentation](https://docs.kalmar.io/use-your-kalm-tokens/voting) and learn about the locking mechanism in our [locking documentation](https://docs.kalmar.io/use-your-kalm-tokens/kalm-locking).\n\n---\n\n- [Visit our Website](https://kalmy.app/)\n- [Follow us on Twitter (X)](https://twitter.com/KalmyAPP)\n- [DeFi Wars - Vault Request Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfkMvHdxRexs8kt_ACmUCY66nY_BgV9ZpVKA5IT4I6-BNkm-Q/viewform?usp=sf_link)",

Whether you're holding, staking, or locking your KALM tokens, you're in control of the ecosystemâ€™s direction.\n\n### How do you make sure that everyone has a voice?\n\nIn the crypto world, voting power often correlates with wealth. While we steer clear of politics, we firmly believe that every voice must be heard.\n\nTo address this, we offer a locking option for committed members who wish to amplify their influence in Kalmy's governance. By locking your KALM tokens, you can significantly increase your voting power. This power scales with the duration of the lock, ranging from 1 to 208 weeks, potentially multiplying your voting power by up to 208 times.\n\nDiscover more about the voting process in our [voting documentation](https://docs.kalmar.io/use-your-kalm-tokens/voting) and learn about the locking mechanism in our [locking documentation](https://docs.kalmar.io/use-your-kalm-tokens/kalm-locking).\n\n---\n\n- [Visit our Website](https://kalmy.app/)\n- [Follow us on Twitter (X)](https://twitter.com/KalmyAPP)\n- [NFT Wars - Vault Request Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdqQofUcwxICZdZqx_ZISCnbjGpKxkI2IxgKU9P86kMeTlpWg/viewform?usp=sf_link)",

It provides a secure platform for communities to demonstrate their collective strength and earn rewards for their engagement.\n\n### What does this mean for KALM token holders?\n\nKALM is more than just a token; it's the driving force behind the Kalmy ecosystem and represents the voice of our community. Whether you're holding, staking, or locking your KALM tokens, you're in control of the ecosystemâ€™s direction.\n\n### How do you make sure that everyone has a voice?\n\nIn the crypto world, voting power often correlates with wealth. While we steer clear of politics, we firmly believe that every voice must be heard.\n\nTo address this, we offer a locking option for committed members who wish to amplify their influence in Kalmy's governance.

The results will be visible within [Kalmy.app](https://kalmy.app/) starting Monday.\n\nYour KALM, your decision.\n\n### What are NFT wars?\n\nNFT Wars are a governance system where communities can use their KALM voting power to participate in weekly votes, deciding which pool gets the most rewards for the upcoming week.\n\nThis system empowers projects to offer more incentives to their token holders. It provides a secure platform for communities to demonstrate their collective strength and earn rewards for their engagement.\n\n### What does this mean for KALM token holders?\n\nKALM is more than just a token; it's the driving force behind the Kalmy ecosystem and represents the voice of our community. Whether you're holding, staking, or locking your KALM tokens, you're in control of the ecosystemâ€™s direction.\n\n### How do you make sure that everyone has a voice?\n\nIn the crypto world, voting power often correlates with wealth. While we steer clear of politics, we firmly believe that every voice must be heard.\n\nTo address this, we offer a locking option for committed members who wish to amplify their influence in Kalmy's governance. By locking your KALM tokens, you can significantly increase your voting power. This power scales with the duration of the lock, ranging from 1 to 208 weeks, potentially multiplying your voting power by up to 208 times.\n\nDiscover more about the voting process in our [voting documentation](https://docs.kalmar.io/use-your-kalm-tokens/voting) and learn about the locking mechanism in our [locking documentation](https://docs.kalmar.io/use-your-kalm-tokens/kalm-locking).\n\n---\n\n- [Visit our Website](https://kalmy.app/)\n- [Follow us on Twitter (X)](https://twitter.com/KalmyAPP)\n- [NFT Wars - Vault Request Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdqQofUcwxICZdZqx_ZISCnbjGpKxkI2IxgKU9P86kMeTlpWg/viewform?usp=sf_link)",

The results will be visible within [Kalmy.app](https://kalmy.app/) starting Monday.\n\nYour KALM, your decision.\n\n### What are NFT wars?\n\nNFT Wars are a governance system where communities can use their KALM voting power to participate in weekly votes, deciding which pool gets the most rewards for the upcoming week.\n\nThis system empowers projects to offer more incentives to their token holders. It provides a secure platform for communities to demonstrate their collective strength and earn rewards for their engagement.\n\n### What does this mean for KALM token holders?\n\nKALM is more than just a token; it's the driving force behind the Kalmy ecosystem and represents the voice of our community. Whether you're holding, staking, or locking your KALM tokens, you're in control of the ecosystemâ€™s direction.\n\n### How do you make sure that everyone has a voice?\n\nIn the crypto world, voting power often correlates with wealth. While we steer clear of politics, we firmly believe that every voice must be heard.\n\nTo address this, we offer a locking option for committed members who wish to amplify their influence in Kalmy's governance. By locking your KALM tokens, you can significantly increase your voting power. This power scales with the duration of the lock, ranging from 1 to 208 weeks, potentially multiplying your voting power by up to 208 times.\n\nDiscover more about the voting process in our [voting documentation](https://docs.kalmar.io/use-your-kalm-tokens/voting) and learn about the locking mechanism in our [locking documentation](https://docs.kalmar.io/use-your-kalm-tokens/kalm-locking).\n\n---\n\n- [Visit our Website](https://kalmy.app/)\n- [Follow us on Twitter (X)](https://twitter.com/KalmyAPP)\n- [NFT Wars - Vault Request Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdqQofUcwxICZdZqx_ZISCnbjGpKxkI2IxgKU9P86kMeTlpWg/viewform?usp=sf_link)",

The results will be visible within [Kalmy.app](https://kalmy.app/) starting Monday.\n\nYour KALM, your decision.\n\n### What are DeFi Wars?\n\nDeFi Wars are a governance system where communities can use their KALM voting power to participate in weekly votes, deciding which vault or staking pool gets the most rewards for the upcoming week.\n\nThis system empowers projects to offer more incentives to their token holders and liquidity providers. It provides a secure platform for communities to demonstrate their collective strength and earn rewards for their engagement.\n\n### What does this mean for KALM token holders?\n\nKALM is more than just a token; it's the driving force behind the Kalmy ecosystem and represents the voice of our community. Whether you're holding, staking, or locking your KALM tokens, you're in control of the ecosystemâ€™s direction.\n\n### How do you make sure that everyone has a voice?\n\nIn the crypto world, voting power often correlates with wealth. While we steer clear of politics, we firmly believe that every voice must be heard.\n\nTo address this, we offer a locking option for committed members who wish to amplify their influence in Kalmy's governance. By locking your KALM tokens, you can significantly increase your voting power. This power scales with the duration of the lock, ranging from 1 to 208 weeks, potentially multiplying your voting power by up to 208 times.\n\nDiscover more about the voting process in our [voting documentation](https://docs.kalmar.io/use-your-kalm-tokens/voting) and learn about the locking mechanism in our [locking documentation](https://docs.kalmar.io/use-your-kalm-tokens/kalm-locking).\n\n---\n\n- [Visit our Website](https://kalmy.app/)\n- [Follow us on Twitter (X)](https://twitter.com/KalmyAPP)\n- [DeFi Wars - Vault Request Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfkMvHdxRexs8kt_ACmUCY66nY_BgV9ZpVKA5IT4I6-BNkm-Q/viewform?usp=sf_link)",

      "content": "Welcome to DeFi Wars. An upgrade of LP Wars, now with staking vaults. This is yet another important chapter of Kalmy.APP ecosystem.\n\nWithin our long term commitment of creating the ultimate DeFi ecosystem empowered by NFT, we are introducing a new low risk DeFi product for Kalmy â€“ a liquidity and staking layer for all quality BNB projects (if tests are success â€“Â we dive into more chains).\n\nThis v2 Kalmy product is a combination of Yearn Finance, Curve, and reviewed whitelisting for user's safety. On one side, this is a traditional auto-compound product for LPs and vaults. An example would be a PanCake or BiSwap LP that gets CAKE/BSW rewards auto-compounded with KALM rewards on top.\n\nAnother example is CAKE for CAKE single stake with KALM rewards on top.\n\nOn another side, there are votes (wars) that run weekly; the KALM rewards on top of CAKE/BSW or CAKE single stake pool are decided by the vote results. It is important to note that any quality LP/vault could be whitelisted, so the liquidity that currently only earns trading fees (no CAKE/BSW/BAKE/other rewards), could start earning KALM just with voting.\n\nOverall, the protocol itself also reviews a Solidly protocol logic, acting as a liquidity layer for projects that do not have farms. This as well becomes an alternative for community farms where projects are traditionally \"paying\" for a non-continuous farm without a predictable schedule by project's leads. \n\nIn Kalmy DeFi Wars case, the predictable rewards are on a rolling basis and are coming from weekly votes. On top, any user is free to vote for any whitelisted farm. As always, locking KALM gives more voting power (the calculator is available on Kalmy.APP, more locks info is as well available in docs).\n\nIt is also important to notice that KalmySwap is an AMM aggregator. This means that initially all new and current LPs would be allocated on PancakeSwap; therefore, the liquidity will be available for trade on both KalmySwap and PancakeSwap â€“ effectively maximizing the amount of users that could actually access liquidity and generate trading fees.\n\nHere is a bit more of the introduction: https://blog.kalmar.io/lp-wars-introduction/\n\nDeFi Wars available weekly rewards might (and likely will) change with the overall emission reductions of KALM token on its road to deflation.\n\nCommunity â€“ please, keep sharing the word.

      "content": "Welcome to DeFi Wars. An upgrade of LP Wars, now with staking vaults. This is yet another important chapter of Kalmy.APP ecosystem.\n\nWithin our long term commitment of creating the ultimate DeFi ecosystem empowered by NFT, we are introducing a new low risk DeFi product for Kalmy â€“ a liquidity and staking layer for all quality BNB projects (if tests are success â€“Â we dive into more chains).\n\nThis v2 Kalmy product is a combination of Yearn Finance, Curve, and reviewed whitelisting for user's safety. On one side, this is a traditional auto-compound product for LPs and vaults. An example would be a PanCake or BiSwap LP that gets CAKE/BSW rewards auto-compounded with KALM rewards on top.\n\nAnother example is CAKE for CAKE single stake with KALM rewards on top.\n\nOn another side, there are votes (wars) that run weekly; the KALM rewards on top of CAKE/BSW or CAKE single stake pool are decided by the vote results. It is important to note that any quality LP/vault could be whitelisted, so the liquidity that currently only earns trading fees (no CAKE/BSW/BAKE/other rewards), could start earning KALM just with voting.\n\nOverall, the protocol itself also reviews a Solidly protocol logic, acting as a liquidity layer for projects that do not have farms. This as well becomes an alternative for community farms where projects are traditionally \"paying\" for a non-continuous farm without a predictable schedule by project's leads. \n\nIn Kalmy DeFi Wars case, the predictable rewards are on a rolling basis and are coming from weekly votes. On top, any user is free to vote for any whitelisted farm. As always, locking KALM gives more voting power (the calculator is available on Kalmy.APP, more locks info is as well available in docs).\n\nIt is also important to notice that KalmySwap is an AMM aggregator. This means that initially all new and current LPs would be allocated on PancakeSwap; therefore, the liquidity will be available for trade on both KalmySwap and PancakeSwap â€“ effectively maximizing the amount of users that could actually access liquidity and generate trading fees.\n\nHere is a bit more of the introduction: https://blog.kalmar.io/lp-wars-introduction/\n\nDeFi Wars available weekly rewards might (and likely will) change with the overall emission reductions of KALM token on its road to deflation.\n\nCommunity â€“ please, keep sharing the word. Projects that are early â€“ don't miss your chance to accumulate some juice for your community before mass FOMO kicks in.\n\nLet's amplify the fun once again, shall we?",

      "content": "Welcome to DeFi Wars. An upgrade of LP Wars, now with staking vaults. This is yet another important chapter of Kalmy.APP ecosystem.\n\nWithin our long term commitment of creating the ultimate DeFi ecosystem empowered by NFT, we are introducing a new low risk DeFi product for Kalmy â€“ a liquidity and staking layer for all quality BNB projects (if tests are success â€“Â we dive into more chains).\n\nThis v2 Kalmy product is a combination of Yearn Finance, Curve, and reviewed whitelisting for user's safety. On one side, this is a traditional auto-compound product for LPs and vaults. An example would be a PanCake or BiSwap LP that gets CAKE/BSW rewards auto-compounded with KALM rewards on top.\n\nAnother example is CAKE for CAKE single stake with KALM rewards on top.\n\nOn another side, there are votes (wars) that run weekly; the KALM rewards on top of CAKE/BSW or CAKE single stake pool are decided by the vote results. It is important to note that any quality LP/vault could be whitelisted, so the liquidity that currently only earns trading fees (no CAKE/BSW/BAKE/other rewards), could start earning KALM just with voting.\n\nOverall, the protocol itself also reviews a Solidly protocol logic, acting as a liquidity layer for projects that do not have farms. This as well becomes an alternative for community farms where projects are traditionally \"paying\" for a non-continuous farm without a predictable schedule by project's leads. \n\nIn Kalmy DeFi Wars case, the predictable rewards are on a rolling basis and are coming from weekly votes. On top, any user is free to vote for any whitelisted farm. As always, locking KALM gives more voting power (the calculator is available on Kalmy.APP, more locks info is as well available in docs).\n\nIt is also important to notice that KalmySwap is an AMM aggregator. This means that initially all new and current LPs would be allocated on PancakeSwap; therefore, the liquidity will be available for trade on both KalmySwap and PancakeSwap â€“ effectively maximizing the amount of users that could actually access liquidity and generate trading fees.\n\nHere is a bit more of the introduction: https://blog.kalmar.io/lp-wars-introduction/\n\nDeFi Wars available weekly rewards might (and likely will) change with the overall emission reductions of KALM token on its road to deflation.\n\nCommunity â€“ please, keep sharing the word. Projects that are early â€“ don't miss your chance to accumulate some juice for your community before mass FOMO kicks in.\n\nLet's amplify the fun once again, shall we?",

      "content": "Welcome to DeFi Wars. An upgrade of LP Wars, now with staking vaults. This is yet another important chapter of Kalmy.APP ecosystem.\n\nWithin our long term commitment of creating the ultimate DeFi ecosystem empowered by NFT, we are introducing a new low risk DeFi product for Kalmy â€“ a liquidity and staking layer for all quality BNB projects (if tests are success â€“Â we dive into more chains).\n\nThis v2 Kalmy product is a combination of Yearn Finance, Curve, and reviewed whitelisting for user's safety. On one side, this is a traditional auto-compound product for LPs and vaults. An example would be a PanCake or BiSwap LP that gets CAKE/BSW rewards auto-compounded with KALM rewards on top.\n\nAnother example is CAKE for CAKE single stake with KALM rewards on top.\n\nOn another side, there are votes (wars) that run weekly; the KALM rewards on top of CAKE/BSW or CAKE single stake pool are decided by the vote results. It is important to note that any quality LP/vault could be whitelisted, so the liquidity that currently only earns trading fees (no CAKE/BSW/BAKE/other rewards), could start earning KALM just with voting.\n\nOverall, the protocol itself also reviews a Solidly protocol logic, acting as a liquidity layer for projects that do not have farms. This as well becomes an alternative for community farms where projects are traditionally \"paying\" for a non-continuous farm without a predictable schedule by project's leads. \n\nIn Kalmy DeFi Wars case, the predictable rewards are on a rolling basis and are coming from weekly votes. On top, any user is free to vote for any whitelisted farm. As always, locking KALM gives more voting power (the calculator is available on Kalmy.APP, more locks info is as well available in docs).\n\nIt is also important to notice that KalmySwap is an AMM aggregator. This means that initially all new and current LPs would be allocated on PancakeSwap; therefore, the liquidity will be available for trade on both KalmySwap and PancakeSwap â€“ effectively maximizing the amount of users that could actually access liquidity and generate trading fees.\n\nHere is a bit more of the introduction: https://blog.kalmar.io/lp-wars-introduction/\n\nDeFi Wars available weekly rewards might (and likely will) change with the overall emission reductions of KALM token on its road to deflation.\n\nCommunity â€“ please, keep sharing the word. Projects that are early â€“ don't miss your chance to accumulate some juice for your community before mass FOMO kicks in.\n\nLet's amplify the fun once again, shall we?",

      "content": "Welcome to DeFi Wars. An upgrade of LP Wars, now with staking vaults. This is yet another important chapter of Kalmy.APP ecosystem.\n\nWithin our long term commitment of creating the ultimate DeFi ecosystem empowered by NFT, we are introducing a new low risk DeFi product for Kalmy â€“ a liquidity and staking layer for all quality BNB projects (if tests are success â€“Â we dive into more chains).\n\nThis v2 Kalmy product is a combination of Yearn Finance, Curve, and reviewed whitelisting for user's safety. On one side, this is a traditional auto-compound product for LPs and vaults. An example would be a PanCake or BiSwap LP that gets CAKE/BSW rewards auto-compounded with KALM rewards on top.\n\nAnother example is CAKE for CAKE single stake with KALM rewards on top.\n\nOn another side, there are votes (wars) that run weekly; the KALM rewards on top of CAKE/BSW or CAKE single stake pool are decided by the vote results. It is important to note that any quality LP/vault could be whitelisted, so the liquidity that currently only earns trading fees (no CAKE/BSW/BAKE/other rewards), could start earning KALM just with voting.\n\nOverall, the protocol itself also reviews a Solidly protocol logic, acting as a liquidity layer for projects that do not have farms. This as well becomes an alternative for community farms where projects are traditionally \"paying\" for a non-continuous farm without a predictable schedule by project's leads. \n\nIn Kalmy DeFi Wars case, the predictable rewards are on a rolling basis and are coming from weekly votes. On top, any user is free to vote for any whitelisted farm. As always, locking KALM gives more voting power (the calculator is available on Kalmy.APP, more locks info is as well available in docs).\n\nIt is also important to notice that KalmySwap is an AMM aggregator. This means that initially all new and current LPs would be allocated on PancakeSwap; therefore, the liquidity will be available for trade on both KalmySwap and PancakeSwap â€“ effectively maximizing the amount of users that could actually access liquidity and generate trading fees.\n\nHere is a bit more of the introduction: https://blog.kalmar.io/lp-wars-introduction/\n\nDeFi Wars available weekly rewards might (and likely will) change with the overall emission reductions of KALM token on its road to deflation.\n\nCommunity â€“ please, keep sharing the word. Projects that are early â€“ don't miss your chance to accumulate some juice for your community before mass FOMO kicks in.\n\nLet's amplify the fun once again, shall we?",

      "content": "Welcome to DeFi Wars. An upgrade of LP Wars, now with staking vaults. This is yet another important chapter of Kalmy.APP ecosystem.\n\nWithin our long term commitment of creating the ultimate DeFi ecosystem empowered by NFT, we are introducing a new low risk DeFi product for Kalmy â€“ a liquidity and staking layer for all quality BNB projects (if tests are success â€“Â we dive into more chains).\n\nThis v2 Kalmy product is a combination of Yearn Finance, Curve, and reviewed whitelisting for user's safety. On one side, this is a traditional auto-compound product for LPs and vaults. An example would be a PanCake or BiSwap LP that gets CAKE/BSW rewards auto-compounded with KALM rewards on top.\n\nAnother example is CAKE for CAKE single stake with KALM rewards on top.\n\nOn another side, there are votes (wars) that run weekly; the KALM rewards on top of CAKE/BSW or CAKE single stake pool are decided by the vote results. It is important to note that any quality LP/vault could be whitelisted, so the liquidity that currently only earns trading fees (no CAKE/BSW/BAKE/other rewards), could start earning KALM just with voting.\n\nOverall, the protocol itself also reviews a Solidly protocol logic, acting as a liquidity layer for projects that do not have farms. This as well becomes an alternative for community farms where projects are traditionally \"paying\" for a non-continuous farm without a predictable schedule by project's leads. \n\nIn Kalmy DeFi Wars case, the predictable rewards are on a rolling basis and are coming from weekly votes. On top, any user is free to vote for any whitelisted farm. As always, locking KALM gives more voting power (the calculator is available on Kalmy.APP, more locks info is as well available in docs).\n\nIt is also important to notice that KalmySwap is an AMM aggregator. This means that initially all new and current LPs would be allocated on PancakeSwap; therefore, the liquidity will be available for trade on both KalmySwap and PancakeSwap â€“ effectively maximizing the amount of users that could actually access liquidity and generate trading fees.\n\nHere is a bit more of the introduction: https://blog.kalmar.io/lp-wars-introduction/\n\nDeFi Wars available weekly rewards might (and likely will) change with the overall emission reductions of KALM token on its road to deflation.\n\nCommunity â€“ please, keep sharing the word. Projects that are early â€“ don't miss your chance to accumulate some juice for your community before mass FOMO kicks in.\n\nLet's amplify the fun once again, shall we?",

      "content": "Welcome to DeFi Wars. An upgrade of LP Wars, now with staking vaults. This is yet another important chapter of Kalmy.APP ecosystem.\n\nWithin our long term commitment of creating the ultimate DeFi ecosystem empowered by NFT, we are introducing a new low risk DeFi product for Kalmy â€“ a liquidity and staking layer for all quality BNB projects (if tests are success â€“Â we dive into more chains).\n\nThis v2 Kalmy product is a combination of Yearn Finance, Curve, and reviewed whitelisting for user's safety. On one side, this is a traditional auto-compound product for LPs and vaults. An example would be a PanCake or BiSwap LP that gets CAKE/BSW rewards auto-compounded with KALM rewards on top.\n\nAnother example is CAKE for CAKE single stake with KALM rewards on top.\n\nOn another side, there are votes (wars) that run weekly; the KALM rewards on top of CAKE/BSW or CAKE single stake pool are decided by the vote results. It is important to note that any quality LP/vault could be whitelisted, so the liquidity that currently only earns trading fees (no CAKE/BSW/BAKE/other rewards), could start earning KALM just with voting.\n\nOverall, the protocol itself also reviews a Solidly protocol logic, acting as a liquidity layer for projects that do not have farms. This as well becomes an alternative for community farms where projects are traditionally \"paying\" for a non-continuous farm without a predictable schedule by project's leads. \n\nIn Kalmy DeFi Wars case, the predictable rewards are on a rolling basis and are coming from weekly votes. On top, any user is free to vote for any whitelisted farm. As always, locking KALM gives more voting power (the calculator is available on Kalmy.APP, more locks info is as well available in docs).\n\nIt is also important to notice that KalmySwap is an AMM aggregator. This means that initially all new and current LPs would be allocated on PancakeSwap; therefore, the liquidity will be available for trade on both KalmySwap and PancakeSwap â€“ effectively maximizing the amount of users that could actually access liquidity and generate trading fees.\n\nHere is a bit more of the introduction: https://blog.kalmar.io/lp-wars-introduction/\n\nDeFi Wars available weekly rewards might (and likely will) change with the overall emission reductions of KALM token on its road to deflation.\n\nCommunity â€“ please, keep sharing the word. Projects that are early â€“ don't miss your chance to accumulate some juice for your community before mass FOMO kicks in.\n\nLet's amplify the fun once again, shall we?",

      "title": "DeFi Wars. Vote 11.",
      "content": "Welcome to DeFi Wars. An upgrade of LP Wars, now with staking vaults. This is yet another important chapter of Kalmy.APP ecosystem.\n\nWithin our long term commitment of creating the ultimate DeFi ecosystem empowered by NFT, we are introducing a new low risk DeFi product for Kalmy â€“ a liquidity and staking layer for all quality BNB projects (if tests are success â€“Â we dive into more chains).\n\nThis v2 Kalmy product is a combination of Yearn Finance, Curve, and reviewed whitelisting for user's safety. On one side, this is a traditional auto-compound product for LPs and vaults. An example would be a PanCake or BiSwap LP that gets CAKE/BSW rewards auto-compounded with KALM rewards on top.\n\nAnother example is CAKE for CAKE single stake with KALM rewards on top.\n\nOn another side, there are votes (wars) that run weekly; the KALM rewards on top of CAKE/BSW or CAKE single stake pool are decided by the vote results. It is important to note that any quality LP/vault could be whitelisted, so the liquidity that currently only earns trading fees (no CAKE/BSW/BAKE/other rewards), could start earning KALM just with voting.\n\nOverall, the protocol itself also reviews a Solidly protocol logic, acting as a liquidity layer for projects that do not have farms. This as well becomes an alternative for community farms where projects are traditionally \"paying\" for a non-continuous farm without a predictable schedule by project's leads. \n\nIn Kalmy DeFi Wars case, the predictable rewards are on a rolling basis and are coming from weekly votes. On top, any user is free to vote for any whitelisted farm. As always, locking KALM gives more voting power (the calculator is available on Kalmy.APP, more locks info is as well available in docs).\n\nIt is also important to notice that KalmySwap is an AMM aggregator. This means that initially all new and current LPs would be allocated on PancakeSwap; therefore, the liquidity will be available for trade on both KalmySwap and PancakeSwap â€“ effectively maximizing the amount of users that could actually access liquidity and generate trading fees.\n\nHere is a bit more of the introduction: https://blog.kalmar.io/lp-wars-introduction/\n\nDeFi Wars available weekly rewards might (and likely will) change with the overall emission reductions of KALM token on its road to deflation.\n\nCommunity â€“ please, keep sharing the word. Projects that are early â€“ don't miss your chance to accumulate some juice for your community before mass FOMO kicks in.\n\nLet's amplify the fun once again, shall we?",

This is yet another important chapter of Kalmy.APP ecosystem.\n\nWithin our long term commitment of creating the ultimate DeFi ecosystem empowered by NFT, we are introducing a new low risk DeFi product for Kalmy â€“ a liquidity and staking layer for all quality BNB projects (if tests are success â€“Â we dive into more chains).\n\nThis v2 Kalmy product is a combination of Yearn Finance, Curve, and reviewed whitelisting for user's safety. On one side, this is a traditional auto-compound product for LPs and vaults. An example would be a PanCake or BiSwap LP that gets CAKE/BSW rewards auto-compounded with KALM rewards on top.\n\nAnother example is CAKE for CAKE single stake with KALM rewards on top.\n\nOn another side, there are votes (wars) that run weekly; the KALM rewards on top of CAKE/BSW or CAKE single stake pool are decided by the vote results. It is important to note that any quality LP/vault could be whitelisted, so the liquidity that currently only earns trading fees (no CAKE/BSW/BAKE/other rewards), could start earning KALM just with voting.\n\nOverall, the protocol itself also reviews a Solidly protocol logic, acting as a liquidity layer for projects that do not have farms. This as well becomes an alternative for community farms where projects are traditionally \"paying\" for a non-continuous farm without a predictable schedule by project's leads. \n\nIn Kalmy DeFi Wars case, the predictable rewards are on a rolling basis and are coming from weekly votes. On top, any user is free to vote for any whitelisted farm. As always, locking KALM gives more voting power (the calculator is available on Kalmy.APP, more locks info is as well available in docs).\n\nIt is also important to notice that KalmySwap is an AMM aggregator. This means that initially all new and current LPs would be allocated on PancakeSwap; therefore, the liquidity will be available for trade on both KalmySwap and PancakeSwap â€“ effectively maximizing the amount of users that could actually access liquidity and generate trading fees.\n\nHere is a bit more of the introduction: https://blog.kalmar.io/lp-wars-introduction/\n\nDeFi Wars available weekly rewards might (and likely will) change with the overall emission reductions of KALM token on its road to deflation.\n\nCommunity â€“ please, keep sharing the word.

      "title": "DeFi Wars. Vote 8.",
      "content": "Welcome to DeFi Wars. An upgrade of LP Wars, now with staking vaults. This is yet another important chapter of Kalmy.APP ecosystem.\n\nWithin our long term commitment of creating the ultimate DeFi ecosystem empowered by NFT, we are introducing a new low risk DeFi product for Kalmy â€“ a liquidity and staking layer for all quality BNB projects (if tests are success â€“Â we dive into more chains).\n\nThis v2 Kalmy product is a combination of Yearn Finance, Curve, and reviewed whitelisting for user's safety. On one side, this is a traditional auto-compound product for LPs and vaults. An example would be a PanCake or BiSwap LP that gets CAKE/BSW rewards auto-compounded with KALM rewards on top.\n\nAnother example is CAKE for CAKE single stake with KALM rewards on top.\n\nOn another side, there are votes (wars) that run weekly; the KALM rewards on top of CAKE/BSW or CAKE single stake pool are decided by the vote results. It is important to note that any quality LP/vault could be whitelisted, so the liquidity that currently only earns trading fees (no CAKE/BSW/BAKE/other rewards), could start earning KALM just with voting.\n\nOverall, the protocol itself also reviews a Solidly protocol logic, acting as a liquidity layer for projects that do not have farms. This as well becomes an alternative for community farms where projects are traditionally \"paying\" for a non-continuous farm without a predictable schedule by project's leads. \n\nIn Kalmy DeFi Wars case, the predictable rewards are on a rolling basis and are coming from weekly votes. On top, any user is free to vote for any whitelisted farm. As always, locking KALM gives more voting power (the calculator is available on Kalmy.APP, more locks info is as well available in docs).\n\nIt is also important to notice that KalmySwap is an AMM aggregator. This means that initially all new and current LPs would be allocated on PancakeSwap; therefore, the liquidity will be available for trade on both KalmySwap and PancakeSwap â€“ effectively maximizing the amount of users that could actually access liquidity and generate trading fees.\n\nHere is a bit more of the introduction: https://blog.kalmar.io/lp-wars-introduction/\n\nDeFi Wars available weekly rewards might (and likely will) change with the overall emission reductions of KALM token on its road to deflation.\n\nCommunity â€“ please, keep sharing the word. Projects that are early â€“ don't miss your chance to accumulate some juice for your community before mass FOMO kicks in.\n\nLet's amplify the fun once again, shall we?",

      "content": "Welcome to DeFi Wars. An upgrade of LP Wars, now with staking vaults. This is yet another important chapter of Kalmy.APP ecosystem.\n\nWithin our long term commitment of creating the ultimate DeFi ecosystem empowered by NFT, we are introducing a new low risk DeFi product for Kalmy â€“ a liquidity and staking layer for all quality BNB projects (if tests are success â€“Â we dive into more chains).\n\nThis v2 Kalmy product is a combination of Yearn Finance, Curve, and reviewed whitelisting for user's safety. On one side, this is a traditional auto-compound product for LPs and vaults. An example would be a PanCake or BiSwap LP that gets CAKE/BSW rewards auto-compounded with KALM rewards on top.\n\nAnother example is CAKE for CAKE single stake with KALM rewards on top.\n\nOn another side, there are votes (wars) that run weekly; the KALM rewards on top of CAKE/BSW or CAKE single stake pool are decided by the vote results. It is important to note that any quality LP/vault could be whitelisted, so the liquidity that currently only earns trading fees (no CAKE/BSW/BAKE/other rewards), could start earning KALM just with voting.\n\nOverall, the protocol itself also reviews a Solidly protocol logic, acting as a liquidity layer for projects that do not have farms. This as well becomes an alternative for community farms where projects are traditionally \"paying\" for a non-continuous farm without a predictable schedule by project's leads. \n\nIn Kalmy DeFi Wars case, the predictable rewards are on a rolling basis and are coming from weekly votes. On top, any user is free to vote for any whitelisted farm. As always, locking KALM gives more voting power (the calculator is available on Kalmy.APP, more locks info is as well available in docs).\n\nIt is also important to notice that KalmySwap is an AMM aggregator. This means that initially all new and current LPs would be allocated on PancakeSwap; therefore, the liquidity will be available for trade on both KalmySwap and PancakeSwap â€“ effectively maximizing the amount of users that could actually access liquidity and generate trading fees.\n\nHere is a bit more of the introduction: https://blog.kalmar.io/lp-wars-introduction/\n\nDeFi Wars available weekly rewards might (and likely will) change with the overall emission reductions of KALM token on its road to deflation.\n\nCommunity â€“ please, keep sharing the word. Projects that are early â€“ don't miss your chance to accumulate some juice for your community before mass FOMO kicks in.\n\nLet's amplify the fun once again, shall we?",

      "title": "DeFi Wars. Vote 6.",
      "content": "Welcome to DeFi Wars. An upgrade of LP Wars, now with staking vaults. This is yet another important chapter of Kalmy.APP ecosystem.\n\nWithin our long term commitment of creating the ultimate DeFi ecosystem empowered by NFT, we are introducing a new low risk DeFi product for Kalmy â€“ a liquidity and staking layer for all quality BNB projects (if tests are success â€“Â we dive into more chains).\n\nThis v2 Kalmy product is a combination of Yearn Finance, Curve, and reviewed whitelisting for user's safety. On one side, this is a traditional auto-compound product for LPs and vaults. An example would be a PanCake or BiSwap LP that gets CAKE/BSW rewards auto-compounded with KALM rewards on top.\n\nAnother example is CAKE for CAKE single stake with KALM rewards on top.\n\nOn another side, there are votes (wars) that run weekly; the KALM rewards on top of CAKE/BSW or CAKE single stake pool are decided by the vote results. It is important to note that any quality LP/vault could be whitelisted, so the liquidity that currently only earns trading fees (no CAKE/BSW/BAKE/other rewards), could start earning KALM just with voting.\n\nOverall, the protocol itself also reviews a Solidly protocol logic, acting as a liquidity layer for projects that do not have farms. This as well becomes an alternative for community farms where projects are traditionally \"paying\" for a non-continuous farm without a predictable schedule by project's leads. \n\nIn Kalmy DeFi Wars case, the predictable rewards are on a rolling basis and are coming from weekly votes. On top, any user is free to vote for any whitelisted farm. As always, locking KALM gives more voting power (the calculator is available on Kalmy.APP, more locks info is as well available in docs).\n\nIt is also important to notice that KalmySwap is an AMM aggregator. This means that initially all new and current LPs would be allocated on PancakeSwap; therefore, the liquidity will be available for trade on both KalmySwap and PancakeSwap â€“ effectively maximizing the amount of users that could actually access liquidity and generate trading fees.\n\nHere is a bit more of the introduction: https://blog.kalmar.io/lp-wars-introduction/\n\nDeFi Wars available weekly rewards might (and likely will) change with the overall emission reductions of KALM token on its road to deflation.\n\nCommunity â€“ please, keep sharing the word. Projects that are early â€“ don't miss your chance to accumulate some juice for your community before mass FOMO kicks in.\n\nLet's amplify the fun once again, shall we?",

      "title": "DeFi Wars. Vote 5.",
      "content": "Welcome to DeFi Wars. An upgrade of LP Wars, now with staking vaults. This is yet another important chapter of Kalmy.APP ecosystem.\n\nWithin our long term commitment of creating the ultimate DeFi ecosystem empowered by NFT, we are introducing a new low risk DeFi product for Kalmy â€“ a liquidity and staking layer for all quality BNB projects (if tests are success â€“Â we dive into more chains).\n\nThis v2 Kalmy product is a combination of Yearn Finance, Curve, and reviewed whitelisting for user's safety. On one side, this is a traditional auto-compound product for LPs and vaults. An example would be a PanCake or BiSwap LP that gets CAKE/BSW rewards auto-compounded with KALM rewards on top.\n\nAnother example is CAKE for CAKE single stake with KALM rewards on top.\n\nOn another side, there are votes (wars) that run weekly; the KALM rewards on top of CAKE/BSW or CAKE single stake pool are decided by the vote results. It is important to note that any quality LP/vault could be whitelisted, so the liquidity that currently only earns trading fees (no CAKE/BSW/BAKE/other rewards), could start earning KALM just with voting.\n\nOverall, the protocol itself also reviews a Solidly protocol logic, acting as a liquidity layer for projects that do not have farms. This as well becomes an alternative for community farms where projects are traditionally \"paying\" for a non-continuous farm without a predictable schedule by project's leads. \n\nIn Kalmy DeFi Wars case, the predictable rewards are on a rolling basis and are coming from weekly votes. On top, any user is free to vote for any whitelisted farm. As always, locking KALM gives more voting power (the calculator is available on Kalmy.APP, more locks info is as well available in docs).\n\nIt is also important to notice that KalmySwap is an AMM aggregator. This means that initially all new and current LPs would be allocated on PancakeSwap; therefore, the liquidity will be available for trade on both KalmySwap and PancakeSwap â€“ effectively maximizing the amount of users that could actually access liquidity and generate trading fees.\n\nHere is a bit more of the introduction: https://blog.kalmar.io/lp-wars-introduction/\n\nDeFi Wars available weekly rewards might (and likely will) change with the overall emission reductions of KALM token on its road to deflation.\n\nCommunity â€“ please, keep sharing the word. Projects that are early â€“ don't miss your chance to accumulate some juice for your community before mass FOMO kicks in.\n\nLet's amplify the fun once again, shall we?",

      "title": "DeFi Wars. Vote 5.",
      "content": "Welcome to DeFi Wars. An upgrade of LP Wars, now with staking vaults. This is yet another important chapter of Kalmy.APP ecosystem.\n\nWithin our long term commitment of creating the ultimate DeFi ecosystem empowered by NFT, we are introducing a new low risk DeFi product for Kalmy â€“ a liquidity and staking layer for all quality BNB projects (if tests are success â€“Â we dive into more chains).\n\nThis v2 Kalmy product is a combination of Yearn Finance, Curve, and reviewed whitelisting for user's safety. On one side, this is a traditional auto-compound product for LPs and vaults. An example would be a PanCake or BiSwap LP that gets CAKE/BSW rewards auto-compounded with KALM rewards on top.\n\nAnother example is CAKE for CAKE single stake with KALM rewards on top.\n\nOn another side, there are votes (wars) that run weekly; the KALM rewards on top of CAKE/BSW or CAKE single stake pool are decided by the vote results. It is important to note that any quality LP/vault could be whitelisted, so the liquidity that currently only earns trading fees (no CAKE/BSW/BAKE/other rewards), could start earning KALM just with voting.\n\nOverall, the protocol itself also reviews a Solidly protocol logic, acting as a liquidity layer for projects that do not have farms. This as well becomes an alternative for community farms where projects are traditionally \"paying\" for a non-continuous farm without a predictable schedule by project's leads. \n\nIn Kalmy DeFi Wars case, the predictable rewards are on a rolling basis and are coming from weekly votes. On top, any user is free to vote for any whitelisted farm. As always, locking KALM gives more voting power (the calculator is available on Kalmy.APP, more locks info is as well available in docs).\n\nIt is also important to notice that KalmySwap is an AMM aggregator. This means that initially all new and current LPs would be allocated on PancakeSwap; therefore, the liquidity will be available for trade on both KalmySwap and PancakeSwap â€“ effectively maximizing the amount of users that could actually access liquidity and generate trading fees.\n\nHere is a bit more of the introduction: https://blog.kalmar.io/lp-wars-introduction/\n\nDeFi Wars available weekly rewards might (and likely will) change with the overall emission reductions of KALM token on its road to deflation.\n\nCommunity â€“ please, keep sharing the word. Projects that are early â€“ don't miss your chance to accumulate some juice for your community before mass FOMO kicks in.\n\nLet's amplify the fun once again, shall we?",

      "content": "Welcome to DeFi Wars. An upgrade of LP Wars, now with staking vaults. This is yet another important chapter of Kalmy.APP ecosystem.\n\nWithin our long term commitment of creating the ultimate DeFi ecosystem empowered by NFT, we are introducing a new low risk DeFi product for Kalmy â€“ a liquidity and staking layer for all quality BNB projects (if tests are success â€“Â we dive into more chains).\n\nThis v2 Kalmy product is a combination of Yearn Finance, Curve, and reviewed whitelisting for user's safety. On one side, this is a traditional auto-compound product for LPs and vaults. An example would be a PanCake or BiSwap LP that gets CAKE/BSW rewards auto-compounded with KALM rewards on top.\n\nAnother example is CAKE for CAKE single stake with KALM rewards on top.\n\nOn another side, there are votes (wars) that run weekly; the KALM rewards on top of CAKE/BSW or CAKE single stake pool are decided by the vote results. It is important to note that any quality LP/vault could be whitelisted, so the liquidity that currently only earns trading fees (no CAKE/BSW/BAKE/other rewards), could start earning KALM just with voting.\n\nOverall, the protocol itself also reviews a Solidly protocol logic, acting as a liquidity layer for projects that do not have farms. This as well becomes an alternative for community farms where projects are traditionally \"paying\" for a non-continuous farm without a predictable schedule by project's leads. \n\nIn Kalmy DeFi Wars case, the predictable rewards are on a rolling basis and are coming from weekly votes. On top, any user is free to vote for any whitelisted farm. As always, locking KALM gives more voting power (the calculator is available on Kalmy.APP, more locks info is as well available in docs).\n\nIt is also important to notice that KalmySwap is an AMM aggregator. This means that initially all new and current LPs would be allocated on PancakeSwap; therefore, the liquidity will be available for trade on both KalmySwap and PancakeSwap â€“ effectively maximizing the amount of users that could actually access liquidity and generate trading fees.\n\nHere is a bit more of the introduction: https://blog.kalmar.io/lp-wars-introduction/\n\nDeFi Wars available weekly rewards might (and likely will) change with the overall emission reductions of KALM token on its road to deflation.\n\nCommunity â€“ please, keep sharing the word. Projects that are early â€“ don't miss your chance to accumulate some juice for your community before mass FOMO kicks in.\n\nLet's amplify the fun once again, shall we?",

Extending duration to 10 (smaller discount) and 20 (larger discount) days.\n\nReasoning: current numbers accommodate the needs well; increased length theoretically could attract more long term-oriented participants.\n\nTotal change for the emissions cuts round proposed: -40 kalm/day.\n\nThe vote is passed if \"Yes\" gets 50.1%+ of the votes. An adjusted vote to follow up based on the distribution of \"No\" responses.",

      "title": "DeFi Wars. Vote 3.",
      "content": "Welcome to DeFi Wars. An upgrade of LP Wars, now with staking vaults. This is yet another important chapter of Kalmy.APP ecosystem.\n\nWithin our long term commitment of creating the ultimate DeFi ecosystem empowered by NFT, we are introducing a new low risk DeFi product for Kalmy â€“ a liquidity and staking layer for all quality BNB projects (if tests are success â€“Â we dive into more chains).\n\nThis v2 Kalmy product is a combination of Yearn Finance, Curve, and reviewed whitelisting for user's safety. On one side, this is a traditional auto-compound product for LPs and vaults. An example would be a PanCake or BiSwap LP that gets CAKE/BSW rewards auto-compounded with KALM rewards on top.\n\nAnother example is CAKE for CAKE single stake with KALM rewards on top.\n\nOn another side, there are votes (wars) that run weekly; the KALM rewards on top of CAKE/BSW or CAKE single stake pool are decided by the vote results. It is important to note that any quality LP/vault could be whitelisted, so the liquidity that currently only earns trading fees (no CAKE/BSW/BAKE/other rewards), could start earning KALM just with voting.\n\nOverall, the protocol itself also reviews a Solidly protocol logic, acting as a liquidity layer for projects that do not have farms. This as well becomes an alternative for community farms where projects are traditionally \"paying\" for a non-continuous farm without a predictable schedule by project's leads. \n\nIn Kalmy DeFi Wars case, the predictable rewards are on a rolling basis and are coming from weekly votes. On top, any user is free to vote for any whitelisted farm. As always, locking KALM gives more voting power (the calculator is available on Kalmy.APP, more locks info is as well available in docs).\n\nIt is also important to notice that KalmySwap is an AMM aggregator. This means that initially all new and current LPs would be allocated on PancakeSwap; therefore, the liquidity will be available for trade on both KalmySwap and PancakeSwap â€“ effectively maximizing the amount of users that could actually access liquidity and generate trading fees.\n\nHere is a bit more of the introduction: https://blog.kalmar.io/lp-wars-introduction/\n\nDeFi Wars available weekly rewards might (and likely will) change with the overall emission reductions of KALM token on its road to deflation.\n\nCommunity â€“ please, keep sharing the word. Projects that are early â€“ don't miss your chance to accumulate some juice for your community before mass FOMO kicks in.\n\nLet's amplify the fun once again, shall we?",

      "title": "DeFi Wars. Vote 2.",
      "content": "Welcome to DeFi Wars. An upgrade of LP Wars, now with staking vaults. This is yet another important chapter of Kalmy.APP ecosystem.\n\nWithin our long term commitment of creating the ultimate DeFi ecosystem empowered by NFT, we are introducing a new low risk DeFi product for Kalmy â€“ a liquidity and staking layer for all quality BNB projects (if tests are success â€“Â we dive into more chains).\n\nThis v2 Kalmy product is a combination of Yearn Finance, Curve, and reviewed whitelisting for user's safety. On one side, this is a traditional auto-compound product for LPs and vaults. An example would be a PanCake or BiSwap LP that gets CAKE/BSW rewards auto-compounded with KALM rewards on top.\n\nAnother example is CAKE for CAKE single stake with KALM rewards on top.\n\nOn another side, there are votes (wars) that run weekly; the KALM rewards on top of CAKE/BSW or CAKE single stake pool are decided by the vote results. It is important to note that any quality LP/vault could be whitelisted, so the liquidity that currently only earns trading fees (no CAKE/BSW/BAKE/other rewards), could start earning KALM just with voting.\n\nOverall, the protocol itself also reviews a Solidly protocol logic, acting as a liquidity layer for projects that do not have farms. This as well becomes an alternative for community farms where projects are traditionally \"paying\" for a non-continuous farm without a predictable schedule by project's leads. \n\nIn Kalmy DeFi Wars case, the predictable rewards are on a rolling basis and are coming from weekly votes. On top, any user is free to vote for any whitelisted farm. As always, locking KALM gives more voting power (the calculator is available on Kalmy.APP, more locks info is as well available in docs).\n\nIt is also important to notice that KalmySwap is an AMM aggregator. This means that initially all new and current LPs would be allocated on PancakeSwap; therefore, the liquidity will be available for trade on both KalmySwap and PancakeSwap â€“ effectively maximizing the amount of users that could actually access liquidity and generate trading fees.\n\nHere is a bit more of the introduction: https://blog.kalmar.io/lp-wars-introduction/\n\nDeFi Wars available weekly rewards might (and likely will) change with the overall emission reductions of KALM token on its road to deflation.\n\nCommunity â€“ please, keep sharing the word. Projects that are early â€“ don't miss your chance to accumulate some juice for your community before mass FOMO kicks in.\n\nLet's amplify the fun once again, shall we?",

      "content": "Welcome to DeFi Wars. An upgrade of LP Wars, now with staking vaults. This is yet another important chapter of Kalmy.APP ecosystem.\n\nWithin our long term commitment of creating the ultimate DeFi ecosystem empowered by NFT, we are introducing a new low risk DeFi product for Kalmy â€“ a liquidity and staking layer for all quality BNB projects (if tests are success â€“Â we dive into more chains).\n\nThis v2 Kalmy product is a combination of Yearn Finance, Curve, and reviewed whitelisting for user's safety. On one side, this is a traditional auto-compound product for LPs and vaults. An example would be a PanCake or BiSwap LP that gets CAKE/BSW rewards auto-compounded with KALM rewards on top.\n\nAnother example is CAKE for CAKE single stake with KALM rewards on top.\n\nOn another side, there are votes (wars) that run weekly; the KALM rewards on top of CAKE/BSW or CAKE single stake pool are decided by the vote results. It is important to note that any quality LP/vault could be whitelisted, so the liquidity that currently only earns trading fees (no CAKE/BSW/BAKE/other rewards), could start earning KALM just with voting.\n\nOverall, the protocol itself also reviews a Solidly protocol logic, acting as a liquidity layer for projects that do not have farms. This as well becomes an alternative for community farms where projects are traditionally \"paying\" for a non-continuous farm without a predictable schedule by project's leads. \n\nIn Kalmy DeFi Wars case, the predictable rewards are on a rolling basis and are coming from weekly votes. On top, any user is free to vote for any whitelisted farm. As always, locking KALM gives more voting power (the calculator is available on Kalmy.APP, more locks info is as well available in docs).\n\nIt is also important to notice that KalmySwap is an AMM aggregator. This means that initially all new and current LPs would be allocated on PancakeSwap; therefore, the liquidity will be available for trade on both KalmySwap and PancakeSwap â€“ effectively maximizing the amount of users that could actually access liquidity and generate trading fees.\n\nHere is a bit more of the introduction: https://blog.kalmar.io/lp-wars-introduction/\n\nDeFi Wars available weekly rewards might (and likely will) change with the overall emission reductions of KALM token on its road to deflation.\n\nCommunity â€“ please, keep sharing the word. Projects that are early â€“ don't miss your chance to accumulate some juice for your community before mass FOMO kicks in.\n\nLet's amplify the fun once again, shall we?",

      "title": "LP Wars Alpha. Vote 33.",
      "content": "Welcome to LP Wars. Again. This is a new important chapter of Kalmy.APP ecosystem.\n\nWithin our long term commitment of creating the ultimate DeFi ecosystem empowered by NFT, we are introducing a new low risk DeFi product for Kalmy â€“ a liquidity layer for all quality BNB projects (if tests are success â€“Â we dive into more chains).\n\nThis new Kalmy product is a combination of Yearn Finance, Curve, and strict whitelisting for user's safety. On one side, this is a traditional auto-compound product for LPs (if tests are success â€“ for vaults like staking). An example would be a PanCake or BiSwap LP that gets CAKE/BSW rewards auto-compounded with KALM rewards on top.\n\nOn another side, there are votes (wars) that run weekly (or biweekly, considering the tests feedback); the KALM rewards on top of CAKE/BSW are decided by the vote results. It is important to note that any quality LP could be whitelisted, so the liquidity that currently only earns trading fees (no CAKE/BSW/BAKE/other rewards), could start earning KALM just with voting.\n\nOverall, the protocol itself also reviews a Solidly protocol logic, acting as a liquidity layer for projects that do not have farms. This as well becomes an alternative for community farms where projects are traditionally \"paying\" for a non-continuous farm without a predictable schedule by project's leads. \n\nIn Kalmy LP Wars case, the predictable rewards are on a rolling basis and are coming from weekly votes. On top, any user is free to vote for any whitelisted farm. As always, locking KALM gives more voting power (the calculator is available on Kalmy.APP, more locks info is as well available in docs).\n\nIt is also important to notice that KalmySwap is an AMM aggregator. This means that initially all new and current LPs would be allocated on PancakeSwap; therefore, the liquidity will be available for trade on both KalmySwap and PancakeSwap â€“ effectively maximizing the amount of users that could actually access liquidity and generate trading fees.\n\nHere is a bit more of the introduction: https://blog.kalmar.io/lp-wars-introduction/\n\nNow, for the test week, we will be using the current 6 LPs KALM rewards. At the same time, we are considering to further reduce our KALM emissions (inflation) rate as well as reduce the daily bonds number. This means that LP Wars available weekly rewards might (and likely will change).\n\nFor the test purpose, we are using some of the classics mixed in with some KALM fun. So, OGs â€“ please, vote. Community â€“ please, start sharing the word. Projects that are early â€“ don't miss your chance to accumulate some juice for your community before mass FOMO kicks in.\n\nLet's amplify the fun, shall we?",

      "title": "LP Wars Alpha. Vote 30.",
      "content": "Welcome to LP Wars. Again. This is a new important chapter of Kalmy.APP ecosystem.\n\nWithin our long term commitment of creating the ultimate DeFi ecosystem empowered by NFT, we are introducing a new low risk DeFi product for Kalmy â€“ a liquidity layer for all quality BNB projects (if tests are success â€“Â we dive into more chains).\n\nThis new Kalmy product is a combination of Yearn Finance, Curve, and strict whitelisting for user's safety. On one side, this is a traditional auto-compound product for LPs (if tests are success â€“ for vaults like staking). An example would be a PanCake or BiSwap LP that gets CAKE/BSW rewards auto-compounded with KALM rewards on top.\n\nOn another side, there are votes (wars) that run weekly (or biweekly, considering the tests feedback); the KALM rewards on top of CAKE/BSW are decided by the vote results. It is important to note that any quality LP could be whitelisted, so the liquidity that currently only earns trading fees (no CAKE/BSW/BAKE/other rewards), could start earning KALM just with voting.\n\nOverall, the protocol itself also reviews a Solidly protocol logic, acting as a liquidity layer for projects that do not have farms. This as well becomes an alternative for community farms where projects are traditionally \"paying\" for a non-continuous farm without a predictable schedule by project's leads. \n\nIn Kalmy LP Wars case, the predictable rewards are on a rolling basis and are coming from weekly votes. On top, any user is free to vote for any whitelisted farm. As always, locking KALM gives more voting power (the calculator is available on Kalmy.APP, more locks info is as well available in docs).\n\nIt is also important to notice that KalmySwap is an AMM aggregator. This means that initially all new and current LPs would be allocated on PancakeSwap; therefore, the liquidity will be available for trade on both KalmySwap and PancakeSwap â€“ effectively maximizing the amount of users that could actually access liquidity and generate trading fees.\n\nHere is a bit more of the introduction: https://blog.kalmar.io/lp-wars-introduction/\n\nNow, for the test week, we will be using the current 6 LPs KALM rewards. At the same time, we are considering to further reduce our KALM emissions (inflation) rate as well as reduce the daily bonds number. This means that LP Wars available weekly rewards might (and likely will change).\n\nFor the test purpose, we are using some of the classics mixed in with some KALM fun. So, OGs â€“ please, vote. Community â€“ please, start sharing the word. Projects that are early â€“ don't miss your chance to accumulate some juice for your community before mass FOMO kicks in.\n\nLet's amplify the fun, shall we?",

      "title": "LP Wars Alpha. Vote 29.",
      "content": "Welcome to LP Wars. Again. This is a new important chapter of Kalmy.APP ecosystem.\n\nWithin our long term commitment of creating the ultimate DeFi ecosystem empowered by NFT, we are introducing a new low risk DeFi product for Kalmy â€“ a liquidity layer for all quality BNB projects (if tests are success â€“Â we dive into more chains).\n\nThis new Kalmy product is a combination of Yearn Finance, Curve, and strict whitelisting for user's safety. On one side, this is a traditional auto-compound product for LPs (if tests are success â€“ for vaults like staking). An example would be a PanCake or BiSwap LP that gets CAKE/BSW rewards auto-compounded with KALM rewards on top.\n\nOn another side, there are votes (wars) that run weekly (or biweekly, considering the tests feedback); the KALM rewards on top of CAKE/BSW are decided by the vote results. It is important to note that any quality LP could be whitelisted, so the liquidity that currently only earns trading fees (no CAKE/BSW/BAKE/other rewards), could start earning KALM just with voting.\n\nOverall, the protocol itself also reviews a Solidly protocol logic, acting as a liquidity layer for projects that do not have farms. This as well becomes an alternative for community farms where projects are traditionally \"paying\" for a non-continuous farm without a predictable schedule by project's leads. \n\nIn Kalmy LP Wars case, the predictable rewards are on a rolling basis and are coming from weekly votes. On top, any user is free to vote for any whitelisted farm. As always, locking KALM gives more voting power (the calculator is available on Kalmy.APP, more locks info is as well available in docs).\n\nIt is also important to notice that KalmySwap is an AMM aggregator. This means that initially all new and current LPs would be allocated on PancakeSwap; therefore, the liquidity will be available for trade on both KalmySwap and PancakeSwap â€“ effectively maximizing the amount of users that could actually access liquidity and generate trading fees.\n\nHere is a bit more of the introduction: https://blog.kalmar.io/lp-wars-introduction/\n\nNow, for the test week, we will be using the current 6 LPs KALM rewards. At the same time, we are considering to further reduce our KALM emissions (inflation) rate as well as reduce the daily bonds number. This means that LP Wars available weekly rewards might (and likely will change).\n\nFor the test purpose, we are using some of the classics mixed in with some KALM fun. So, OGs â€“ please, vote. Community â€“ please, start sharing the word. Projects that are early â€“ don't miss your chance to accumulate some juice for your community before mass FOMO kicks in.\n\nLet's amplify the fun, shall we?",

      "title": "LP Wars Alpha. Vote 28.",
      "content": "Welcome to LP Wars. Again. This is a new important chapter of Kalmy.APP ecosystem.\n\nWithin our long term commitment of creating the ultimate DeFi ecosystem empowered by NFT, we are introducing a new low risk DeFi product for Kalmy â€“ a liquidity layer for all quality BNB projects (if tests are success â€“Â we dive into more chains).\n\nThis new Kalmy product is a combination of Yearn Finance, Curve, and strict whitelisting for user's safety. On one side, this is a traditional auto-compound product for LPs (if tests are success â€“ for vaults like staking). An example would be a PanCake or BiSwap LP that gets CAKE/BSW rewards auto-compounded with KALM rewards on top.\n\nOn another side, there are votes (wars) that run weekly (or biweekly, considering the tests feedback); the KALM rewards on top of CAKE/BSW are decided by the vote results. It is important to note that any quality LP could be whitelisted, so the liquidity that currently only earns trading fees (no CAKE/BSW/BAKE/other rewards), could start earning KALM just with voting.\n\nOverall, the protocol itself also reviews a Solidly protocol logic, acting as a liquidity layer for projects that do not have farms. This as well becomes an alternative for community farms where projects are traditionally \"paying\" for a non-continuous farm without a predictable schedule by project's leads. \n\nIn Kalmy LP Wars case, the predictable rewards are on a rolling basis and are coming from weekly votes. On top, any user is free to vote for any whitelisted farm. As always, locking KALM gives more voting power (the calculator is available on Kalmy.APP, more locks info is as well available in docs).\n\nIt is also important to notice that KalmySwap is an AMM aggregator. This means that initially all new and current LPs would be allocated on PancakeSwap; therefore, the liquidity will be available for trade on both KalmySwap and PancakeSwap â€“ effectively maximizing the amount of users that could actually access liquidity and generate trading fees.\n\nHere is a bit more of the introduction: https://blog.kalmar.io/lp-wars-introduction/\n\nNow, for the test week, we will be using the current 6 LPs KALM rewards. At the same time, we are considering to further reduce our KALM emissions (inflation) rate as well as reduce the daily bonds number. This means that LP Wars available weekly rewards might (and likely will change).\n\nFor the test purpose, we are using some of the classics mixed in with some KALM fun. So, OGs â€“ please, vote. Community â€“ please, start sharing the word. Projects that are early â€“ don't miss your chance to accumulate some juice for your community before mass FOMO kicks in.\n\nLet's amplify the fun, shall we?",

      "title": "LP Wars Alpha. Vote 27.",
      "content": "Welcome to LP Wars. Again. This is a new important chapter of Kalmy.APP ecosystem.\n\nWithin our long term commitment of creating the ultimate DeFi ecosystem empowered by NFT, we are introducing a new low risk DeFi product for Kalmy â€“ a liquidity layer for all quality BNB projects (if tests are success â€“Â we dive into more chains).\n\nThis new Kalmy product is a combination of Yearn Finance, Curve, and strict whitelisting for user's safety. On one side, this is a traditional auto-compound product for LPs (if tests are success â€“ for vaults like staking). An example would be a PanCake or BiSwap LP that gets CAKE/BSW rewards auto-compounded with KALM rewards on top.\n\nOn another side, there are votes (wars) that run weekly (or biweekly, considering the tests feedback); the KALM rewards on top of CAKE/BSW are decided by the vote results. It is important to note that any quality LP could be whitelisted, so the liquidity that currently only earns trading fees (no CAKE/BSW/BAKE/other rewards), could start earning KALM just with voting.\n\nOverall, the protocol itself also reviews a Solidly protocol logic, acting as a liquidity layer for projects that do not have farms. This as well becomes an alternative for community farms where projects are traditionally \"paying\" for a non-continuous farm without a predictable schedule by project's leads. \n\nIn Kalmy LP Wars case, the predictable rewards are on a rolling basis and are coming from weekly votes. On top, any user is free to vote for any whitelisted farm. As always, locking KALM gives more voting power (the calculator is available on Kalmy.APP, more locks info is as well available in docs).\n\nIt is also important to notice that KalmySwap is an AMM aggregator. This means that initially all new and current LPs would be allocated on PancakeSwap; therefore, the liquidity will be available for trade on both KalmySwap and PancakeSwap â€“ effectively maximizing the amount of users that could actually access liquidity and generate trading fees.\n\nHere is a bit more of the introduction: https://blog.kalmar.io/lp-wars-introduction/\n\nNow, for the test week, we will be using the current 6 LPs KALM rewards. At the same time, we are considering to further reduce our KALM emissions (inflation) rate as well as reduce the daily bonds number. This means that LP Wars available weekly rewards might (and likely will change).\n\nFor the test purpose, we are using some of the classics mixed in with some KALM fun. So, OGs â€“ please, vote. Community â€“ please, start sharing the word. Projects that are early â€“ don't miss your chance to accumulate some juice for your community before mass FOMO kicks in.\n\nLet's amplify the fun, shall we?",

This is a new important chapter of Kalmy.APP ecosystem.\n\nWithin our long term commitment of creating the ultimate DeFi ecosystem empowered by NFT, we are introducing a new low risk DeFi product for Kalmy â€“ a liquidity layer for all quality BNB projects (if tests are success â€“Â we dive into more chains).\n\nThis new Kalmy product is a combination of Yearn Finance, Curve, and strict whitelisting for user's safety. On one side, this is a traditional auto-compound product for LPs (if tests are success â€“ for vaults like staking). An example would be a PanCake or BiSwap LP that gets CAKE/BSW rewards auto-compounded with KALM rewards on top.\n\nOn another side, there are votes (wars) that run weekly (or biweekly, considering the tests feedback); the KALM rewards on top of CAKE/BSW are decided by the vote results. It is important to note that any quality LP could be whitelisted, so the liquidity that currently only earns trading fees (no CAKE/BSW/BAKE/other rewards), could start earning KALM just with voting.\n\nOverall, the protocol itself also reviews a Solidly protocol logic, acting as a liquidity layer for projects that do not have farms. This as well becomes an alternative for community farms where projects are traditionally \"paying\" for a non-continuous farm without a predictable schedule by project's leads. \n\nIn Kalmy LP Wars case, the predictable rewards are on a rolling basis and are coming from weekly votes. On top, any user is free to vote for any whitelisted farm. As always, locking KALM gives more voting power (the calculator is available on Kalmy.APP, more locks info is as well available in docs).\n\nIt is also important to notice that KalmySwap is an AMM aggregator. This means that initially all new and current LPs would be allocated on PancakeSwap; therefore, the liquidity will be available for trade on both KalmySwap and PancakeSwap â€“ effectively maximizing the amount of users that could actually access liquidity and generate trading fees.\n\nHere is a bit more of the introduction: https://blog.kalmar.io/lp-wars-introduction/\n\nNow, for the test week, we will be using the current 6 LPs KALM rewards.

      "content": "Welcome to LP Wars. Again. This is a new important chapter of Kalmy.APP ecosystem.\n\nWithin our long term commitment of creating the ultimate DeFi ecosystem empowered by NFT, we are introducing a new low risk DeFi product for Kalmy â€“ a liquidity layer for all quality BNB projects (if tests are success â€“Â we dive into more chains).\n\nThis new Kalmy product is a combination of Yearn Finance, Curve, and strict whitelisting for user's safety. On one side, this is a traditional auto-compound product for LPs (if tests are success â€“ for vaults like staking). An example would be a PanCake or BiSwap LP that gets CAKE/BSW rewards auto-compounded with KALM rewards on top.\n\nOn another side, there are votes (wars) that run weekly (or biweekly, considering the tests feedback); the KALM rewards on top of CAKE/BSW are decided by the vote results. It is important to note that any quality LP could be whitelisted, so the liquidity that currently only earns trading fees (no CAKE/BSW/BAKE/other rewards), could start earning KALM just with voting.\n\nOverall, the protocol itself also reviews a Solidly protocol logic, acting as a liquidity layer for projects that do not have farms. This as well becomes an alternative for community farms where projects are traditionally \"paying\" for a non-continuous farm without a predictable schedule by project's leads. \n\nIn Kalmy LP Wars case, the predictable rewards are on a rolling basis and are coming from weekly votes. On top, any user is free to vote for any whitelisted farm. As always, locking KALM gives more voting power (the calculator is available on Kalmy.APP, more locks info is as well available in docs).\n\nIt is also important to notice that KalmySwap is an AMM aggregator. This means that initially all new and current LPs would be allocated on PancakeSwap; therefore, the liquidity will be available for trade on both KalmySwap and PancakeSwap â€“ effectively maximizing the amount of users that could actually access liquidity and generate trading fees.\n\nHere is a bit more of the introduction: https://blog.kalmar.io/lp-wars-introduction/\n\nNow, for the test week, we will be using the current 6 LPs KALM rewards. At the same time, we are considering to further reduce our KALM emissions (inflation) rate as well as reduce the daily bonds number. This means that LP Wars available weekly rewards might (and likely will change).\n\nFor the test purpose, we are using some of the classics mixed in with some KALM fun. So, OGs â€“ please, vote. Community â€“ please, start sharing the word. Projects that are early â€“ don't miss your chance to accumulate some juice for your community before mass FOMO kicks in.\n\nLet's amplify the fun, shall we?",

This as well becomes an alternative for community farms where projects are traditionally \"paying\" for a non-continuous farm without a predictable schedule by project's leads. \n\nIn Kalmy LP Wars case, the predictable rewards are on a rolling basis and are coming from weekly votes. On top, any user is free to vote for any whitelisted farm. As always, locking KALM gives more voting power (the calculator is available on Kalmy.APP, more locks info is as well available in docs).\n\nIt is also important to notice that KalmySwap is an AMM aggregator. This means that initially all new and current LPs would be allocated on PancakeSwap; therefore, the liquidity will be available for trade on both KalmySwap and PancakeSwap â€“ effectively maximizing the amount of users that could actually access liquidity and generate trading fees.\n\nHere is a bit more of the introduction: https://blog.kalmar.io/lp-wars-introduction/\n\nNow, for the test week, we will be using the current 6 LPs KALM rewards. At the same time, we are considering to further reduce our KALM emissions (inflation) rate as well as reduce the daily bonds number. This means that LP Wars available weekly rewards might (and likely will change).\n\nFor the test purpose, we are using some of the classics mixed in with some KALM fun. So, OGs â€“ please, vote. Community â€“ please, start sharing the word. Projects that are early â€“ don't miss your chance to accumulate some juice for your community before mass FOMO kicks in.\n\nLet's amplify the fun, shall we?",

This is a new important chapter of Kalmy.APP ecosystem.\n\nWithin our long term commitment of creating the ultimate DeFi ecosystem empowered by NFT, we are introducing a new low risk DeFi product for Kalmy â€“ a liquidity layer for all quality BNB projects (if tests are success â€“Â we dive into more chains).\n\nThis new Kalmy product is a combination of Yearn Finance, Curve, and strict whitelisting for user's safety. On one side, this is a traditional auto-compound product for LPs (if tests are success â€“ for vaults like staking). An example would be a PanCake or BiSwap LP that gets CAKE/BSW rewards auto-compounded with KALM rewards on top.\n\nOn another side, there are votes (wars) that run weekly (or biweekly, considering the tests feedback); the KALM rewards on top of CAKE/BSW are decided by the vote results. It is important to note that any quality LP could be whitelisted, so the liquidity that currently only earns trading fees (no CAKE/BSW/BAKE/other rewards), could start earning KALM just with voting.\n\nOverall, the protocol itself also reviews a Solidly protocol logic, acting as a liquidity layer for projects that do not have farms.

      "content": "Welcome to LP Wars. Again. This is a new important chapter of Kalmy.APP ecosystem.\n\nWithin our long term commitment of creating the ultimate DeFi ecosystem empowered by NFT, we are introducing a new low risk DeFi product for Kalmy â€“ a liquidity layer for all quality BNB projects (if tests are success â€“Â we dive into more chains).\n\nThis new Kalmy product is a combination of Yearn Finance, Curve, and strict whitelisting for user's safety. On one side, this is a traditional auto-compound product for LPs (if tests are success â€“ for vaults like staking). An example would be a PanCake or BiSwap LP that gets CAKE/BSW rewards auto-compounded with KALM rewards on top.\n\nOn another side, there are votes (wars) that run weekly (or biweekly, considering the tests feedback); the KALM rewards on top of CAKE/BSW are decided by the vote results. It is important to note that any quality LP could be whitelisted, so the liquidity that currently only earns trading fees (no CAKE/BSW/BAKE/other rewards), could start earning KALM just with voting.\n\nOverall, the protocol itself also reviews a Solidly protocol logic, acting as a liquidity layer for projects that do not have farms. This as well becomes an alternative for community farms where projects are traditionally \"paying\" for a non-continuous farm without a predictable schedule by project's leads. \n\nIn Kalmy LP Wars case, the predictable rewards are on a rolling basis and are coming from weekly votes.

      "title": "LP Wars Alpha. Vote 20.",
      "content": "Welcome to LP Wars. Again. This is a new important chapter of Kalmy.APP ecosystem.\n\nWithin our long term commitment of creating the ultimate DeFi ecosystem empowered by NFT, we are introducing a new low risk DeFi product for Kalmy â€“ a liquidity layer for all quality BNB projects (if tests are success â€“Â we dive into more chains).\n\nThis new Kalmy product is a combination of Yearn Finance, Curve, and strict whitelisting for user's safety. On one side, this is a traditional auto-compound product for LPs (if tests are success â€“ for vaults like staking). An example would be a PanCake or BiSwap LP that gets CAKE/BSW rewards auto-compounded with KALM rewards on top.\n\nOn another side, there are votes (wars) that run weekly (or biweekly, considering the tests feedback); the KALM rewards on top of CAKE/BSW are decided by the vote results. It is important to note that any quality LP could be whitelisted, so the liquidity that currently only earns trading fees (no CAKE/BSW/BAKE/other rewards), could start earning KALM just with voting.\n\nOverall, the protocol itself also reviews a Solidly protocol logic, acting as a liquidity layer for projects that do not have farms. This as well becomes an alternative for community farms where projects are traditionally \"paying\" for a non-continuous farm without a predictable schedule by project's leads. \n\nIn Kalmy LP Wars case, the predictable rewards are on a rolling basis and are coming from weekly votes. On top, any user is free to vote for any whitelisted farm. As always, locking KALM gives more voting power (the calculator is available on Kalmy.APP, more locks info is as well available in docs).\n\nIt is also important to notice that KalmySwap is an AMM aggregator. This means that initially all new and current LPs would be allocated on PancakeSwap; therefore, the liquidity will be available for trade on both KalmySwap and PancakeSwap â€“ effectively maximizing the amount of users that could actually access liquidity and generate trading fees.\n\nHere is a bit more of the introduction: https://blog.kalmar.io/lp-wars-introduction/\n\nNow, for the test week, we will be using the current 6 LPs KALM rewards. At the same time, we are considering to further reduce our KALM emissions (inflation) rate as well as reduce the daily bonds number. This means that LP Wars available weekly rewards might (and likely will change).\n\nFor the test purpose, we are using some of the classics mixed in with some KALM fun. So, OGs â€“ please, vote. Community â€“ please, start sharing the word. Projects that are early â€“ don't miss your chance to accumulate some juice for your community before mass FOMO kicks in.\n\nLet's amplify the fun, shall we?",

      "title": "LP Wars Alpha. Vote 19.",
      "content": "Welcome to LP Wars. Again. This is a new important chapter of Kalmy.APP ecosystem.\n\nWithin our long term commitment of creating the ultimate DeFi ecosystem empowered by NFT, we are introducing a new low risk DeFi product for Kalmy â€“ a liquidity layer for all quality BNB projects (if tests are success â€“Â we dive into more chains).\n\nThis new Kalmy product is a combination of Yearn Finance, Curve, and strict whitelisting for user's safety. On one side, this is a traditional auto-compound product for LPs (if tests are success â€“ for vaults like staking). An example would be a PanCake or BiSwap LP that gets CAKE/BSW rewards auto-compounded with KALM rewards on top.\n\nOn another side, there are votes (wars) that run weekly (or biweekly, considering the tests feedback); the KALM rewards on top of CAKE/BSW are decided by the vote results. It is important to note that any quality LP could be whitelisted, so the liquidity that currently only earns trading fees (no CAKE/BSW/BAKE/other rewards), could start earning KALM just with voting.\n\nOverall, the protocol itself also reviews a Solidly protocol logic, acting as a liquidity layer for projects that do not have farms. This as well becomes an alternative for community farms where projects are traditionally \"paying\" for a non-continuous farm without a predictable schedule by project's leads. \n\nIn Kalmy LP Wars case, the predictable rewards are on a rolling basis and are coming from weekly votes. On top, any user is free to vote for any whitelisted farm. As always, locking KALM gives more voting power (the calculator is available on Kalmy.APP, more locks info is as well available in docs).\n\nIt is also important to notice that KalmySwap is an AMM aggregator. This means that initially all new and current LPs would be allocated on PancakeSwap; therefore, the liquidity will be available for trade on both KalmySwap and PancakeSwap â€“ effectively maximizing the amount of users that could actually access liquidity and generate trading fees.\n\nHere is a bit more of the introduction: https://blog.kalmar.io/lp-wars-introduction/\n\nNow, for the test week, we will be using the current 6 LPs KALM rewards. At the same time, we are considering to further reduce our KALM emissions (inflation) rate as well as reduce the daily bonds number. This means that LP Wars available weekly rewards might (and likely will change).\n\nFor the test purpose, we are using some of the classics mixed in with some KALM fun. So, OGs â€“ please, vote. Community â€“ please, start sharing the word. Projects that are early â€“ don't miss your chance to accumulate some juice for your community before mass FOMO kicks in.\n\nLet's amplify the fun, shall we?",

      "title": "LP Wars Alpha. Vote 18.",
      "content": "Welcome to LP Wars. Again. This is a new important chapter of Kalmy.APP ecosystem.\n\nWithin our long term commitment of creating the ultimate DeFi ecosystem empowered by NFT, we are introducing a new low risk DeFi product for Kalmy â€“ a liquidity layer for all quality BNB projects (if tests are success â€“Â we dive into more chains).\n\nThis new Kalmy product is a combination of Yearn Finance, Curve, and strict whitelisting for user's safety. On one side, this is a traditional auto-compound product for LPs (if tests are success â€“ for vaults like staking). An example would be a PanCake or BiSwap LP that gets CAKE/BSW rewards auto-compounded with KALM rewards on top.\n\nOn another side, there are votes (wars) that run weekly (or biweekly, considering the tests feedback); the KALM rewards on top of CAKE/BSW are decided by the vote results. It is important to note that any quality LP could be whitelisted, so the liquidity that currently only earns trading fees (no CAKE/BSW/BAKE/other rewards), could start earning KALM just with voting.\n\nOverall, the protocol itself also reviews a Solidly protocol logic, acting as a liquidity layer for projects that do not have farms. This as well becomes an alternative for community farms where projects are traditionally \"paying\" for a non-continuous farm without a predictable schedule by project's leads. \n\nIn Kalmy LP Wars case, the predictable rewards are on a rolling basis and are coming from weekly votes. On top, any user is free to vote for any whitelisted farm. As always, locking KALM gives more voting power (the calculator is available on Kalmy.APP, more locks info is as well available in docs).\n\nIt is also important to notice that KalmySwap is an AMM aggregator. This means that initially all new and current LPs would be allocated on PancakeSwap; therefore, the liquidity will be available for trade on both KalmySwap and PancakeSwap â€“ effectively maximizing the amount of users that could actually access liquidity and generate trading fees.\n\nHere is a bit more of the introduction: https://blog.kalmar.io/lp-wars-introduction/\n\nNow, for the test week, we will be using the current 6 LPs KALM rewards. At the same time, we are considering to further reduce our KALM emissions (inflation) rate as well as reduce the daily bonds number. This means that LP Wars available weekly rewards might (and likely will change).\n\nFor the test purpose, we are using some of the classics mixed in with some KALM fun. So, OGs â€“ please, vote. Community â€“ please, start sharing the word. Projects that are early â€“ don't miss your chance to accumulate some juice for your community before mass FOMO kicks in.\n\nLet's amplify the fun, shall we?",

This is a new important chapter of Kalmy.APP ecosystem.\n\nWithin our long term commitment of creating the ultimate DeFi ecosystem empowered by NFT, we are introducing a new low risk DeFi product for Kalmy â€“ a liquidity layer for all quality BNB projects (if tests are success â€“Â we dive into more chains).\n\nThis new Kalmy product is a combination of Yearn Finance, Curve, and strict whitelisting for user's safety. On one side, this is a traditional auto-compound product for LPs (if tests are success â€“ for vaults like staking). An example would be a PanCake or BiSwap LP that gets CAKE/BSW rewards auto-compounded with KALM rewards on top.\n\nOn another side, there are votes (wars) that run weekly (or biweekly, considering the tests feedback); the KALM rewards on top of CAKE/BSW are decided by the vote results. It is important to note that any quality LP could be whitelisted, so the liquidity that currently only earns trading fees (no CAKE/BSW/BAKE/other rewards), could start earning KALM just with voting.\n\nOverall, the protocol itself also reviews a Solidly protocol logic, acting as a liquidity layer for projects that do not have farms. This as well becomes an alternative for community farms where projects are traditionally \"paying\" for a non-continuous farm without a predictable schedule by project's leads. \n\nIn Kalmy LP Wars case, the predictable rewards are on a rolling basis and are coming from weekly votes. On top, any user is free to vote for any whitelisted farm. As always, locking KALM gives more voting power (the calculator is available on Kalmy.APP, more locks info is as well available in docs).\n\nIt is also important to notice that KalmySwap is an AMM aggregator. This means that initially all new and current LPs would be allocated on PancakeSwap; therefore, the liquidity will be available for trade on both KalmySwap and PancakeSwap â€“ effectively maximizing the amount of users that could actually access liquidity and generate trading fees.\n\nHere is a bit more of the introduction: https://blog.kalmar.io/lp-wars-introduction/\n\nNow, for the test week, we will be using the current 6 LPs KALM rewards. At the same time, we are considering to further reduce our KALM emissions (inflation) rate as well as reduce the daily bonds number. This means that LP Wars available weekly rewards might (and likely will change).\n\nFor the test purpose, we are using some of the classics mixed in with some KALM fun. So, OGs â€“ please, vote. Community â€“ please, start sharing the word. Projects that are early â€“ don't miss your chance to accumulate some juice for your community before mass FOMO kicks in.\n\nLet's amplify the fun, shall we?",

This is a new important chapter of Kalmy.APP ecosystem.\n\nWithin our long term commitment of creating the ultimate DeFi ecosystem empowered by NFT, we are introducing a new low risk DeFi product for Kalmy â€“ a liquidity layer for all quality BNB projects (if tests are success â€“Â we dive into more chains).\n\nThis new Kalmy product is a combination of Yearn Finance, Curve, and strict whitelisting for user's safety. On one side, this is a traditional auto-compound product for LPs (if tests are success â€“ for vaults like staking). An example would be a PanCake or BiSwap LP that gets CAKE/BSW rewards auto-compounded with KALM rewards on top.\n\nOn another side, there are votes (wars) that run weekly (or biweekly, considering the tests feedback); the KALM rewards on top of CAKE/BSW are decided by the vote results. It is important to note that any quality LP could be whitelisted, so the liquidity that currently only earns trading fees (no CAKE/BSW/BAKE/other rewards), could start earning KALM just with voting.\n\nOverall, the protocol itself also reviews a Solidly protocol logic, acting as a liquidity layer for projects that do not have farms. This as well becomes an alternative for community farms where projects are traditionally \"paying\" for a non-continuous farm without a predictable schedule by project's leads. \n\nIn Kalmy LP Wars case, the predictable rewards are on a rolling basis and are coming from weekly votes. On top, any user is free to vote for any whitelisted farm. As always, locking KALM gives more voting power (the calculator is available on Kalmy.APP, more locks info is as well available in docs).\n\nIt is also important to notice that KalmySwap is an AMM aggregator. This means that initially all new and current LPs would be allocated on PancakeSwap; therefore, the liquidity will be available for trade on both KalmySwap and PancakeSwap â€“ effectively maximizing the amount of users that could actually access liquidity and generate trading fees.\n\nHere is a bit more of the introduction: https://blog.kalmar.io/lp-wars-introduction/\n\nNow, for the test week, we will be using the current 6 LPs KALM rewards. At the same time, we are considering to further reduce our KALM emissions (inflation) rate as well as reduce the daily bonds number.

      "content": "Welcome to LP Wars. Again. This is a new important chapter of Kalmy.APP ecosystem.\n\nWithin our long term commitment of creating the ultimate DeFi ecosystem empowered by NFT, we are introducing a new low risk DeFi product for Kalmy â€“ a liquidity layer for all quality BNB projects (if tests are success â€“Â we dive into more chains).\n\nThis new Kalmy product is a combination of Yearn Finance, Curve, and strict whitelisting for user's safety. On one side, this is a traditional auto-compound product for LPs (if tests are success â€“ for vaults like staking). An example would be a PanCake or BiSwap LP that gets CAKE/BSW rewards auto-compounded with KALM rewards on top.\n\nOn another side, there are votes (wars) that run weekly (or biweekly, considering the tests feedback); the KALM rewards on top of CAKE/BSW are decided by the vote results. It is important to note that any quality LP could be whitelisted, so the liquidity that currently only earns trading fees (no CAKE/BSW/BAKE/other rewards), could start earning KALM just with voting.\n\nOverall, the protocol itself also reviews a Solidly protocol logic, acting as a liquidity layer for projects that do not have farms. This as well becomes an alternative for community farms where projects are traditionally \"paying\" for a non-continuous farm without a predictable schedule by project's leads. \n\nIn Kalmy LP Wars case, the predictable rewards are on a rolling basis and are coming from weekly votes. On top, any user is free to vote for any whitelisted farm. As always, locking KALM gives more voting power (the calculator is available on Kalmy.APP, more locks info is as well available in docs).\n\nIt is also important to notice that KalmySwap is an AMM aggregator. This means that initially all new and current LPs would be allocated on PancakeSwap; therefore, the liquidity will be available for trade on both KalmySwap and PancakeSwap â€“ effectively maximizing the amount of users that could actually access liquidity and generate trading fees.\n\nHere is a bit more of the introduction: https://blog.kalmar.io/lp-wars-introduction/\n\nNow, for the test week, we will be using the current 6 LPs KALM rewards. At the same time, we are considering to further reduce our KALM emissions (inflation) rate as well as reduce the daily bonds number. This means that LP Wars available weekly rewards might (and likely will change).\n\nFor the test purpose, we are using some of the classics mixed in with some KALM fun. So, OGs â€“ please, vote. Community â€“ please, start sharing the word. Projects that are early â€“ don't miss your chance to accumulate some juice for your community before mass FOMO kicks in.\n\nLet's amplify the fun, shall we?",

An example would be a PanCake or BiSwap LP that gets CAKE/BSW rewards auto-compounded with KALM rewards on top.\n\nOn another side, there are votes (wars) that run weekly (or biweekly, considering the tests feedback); the KALM rewards on top of CAKE/BSW are decided by the vote results. It is important to note that any quality LP could be whitelisted, so the liquidity that currently only earns trading fees (no CAKE/BSW/BAKE/other rewards), could start earning KALM just with voting.\n\nOverall, the protocol itself also reviews a Solidly protocol logic, acting as a liquidity layer for projects that do not have farms. This as well becomes an alternative for community farms where projects are traditionally \"paying\" for a non-continuous farm without a predictable schedule by project's leads. \n\nIn Kalmy LP Wars case, the predictable rewards are on a rolling basis and are coming from weekly votes. On top, any user is free to vote for any whitelisted farm. As always, locking KALM gives more voting power (the calculator is available on Kalmy.APP, more locks info is as well available in docs).\n\nIt is also important to notice that KalmySwap is an AMM aggregator. This means that initially all new and current LPs would be allocated on PancakeSwap; therefore, the liquidity will be available for trade on both KalmySwap and PancakeSwap â€“ effectively maximizing the amount of users that could actually access liquidity and generate trading fees.\n\nHere is a bit more of the introduction: https://blog.kalmar.io/lp-wars-introduction/\n\nNow, for the test week, we will be using the current 6 LPs KALM rewards. At the same time, we are considering to further reduce our KALM emissions (inflation) rate as well as reduce the daily bonds number. This means that LP Wars available weekly rewards might (and likely will change).\n\nFor the test purpose, we are using some of the classics mixed in with some KALM fun. So, OGs â€“ please, vote. Community â€“ please, start sharing the word. Projects that are early â€“ don't miss your chance to accumulate some juice for your community before mass FOMO kicks in.\n\nLet's amplify the fun, shall we?",

      "title": "LP Wars Alpha. Vote 12.",
      "content": "Welcome to LP Wars. Again. This is a new important chapter of Kalmy.APP ecosystem.\n\nWithin our long term commitment of creating the ultimate DeFi ecosystem empowered by NFT, we are introducing a new low risk DeFi product for Kalmy â€“ a liquidity layer for all quality BNB projects (if tests are success â€“Â we dive into more chains).\n\nThis new Kalmy product is a combination of Yearn Finance, Curve, and strict whitelisting for user's safety. On one side, this is a traditional auto-compound product for LPs (if tests are success â€“ for vaults like staking). An example would be a PanCake or BiSwap LP that gets CAKE/BSW rewards auto-compounded with KALM rewards on top.\n\nOn another side, there are votes (wars) that run weekly (or biweekly, considering the tests feedback); the KALM rewards on top of CAKE/BSW are decided by the vote results. It is important to note that any quality LP could be whitelisted, so the liquidity that currently only earns trading fees (no CAKE/BSW/BAKE/other rewards), could start earning KALM just with voting.\n\nOverall, the protocol itself also reviews a Solidly protocol logic, acting as a liquidity layer for projects that do not have farms. This as well becomes an alternative for community farms where projects are traditionally \"paying\" for a non-continuous farm without a predictable schedule by project's leads. \n\nIn Kalmy LP Wars case, the predictable rewards are on a rolling basis and are coming from weekly votes. On top, any user is free to vote for any whitelisted farm. As always, locking KALM gives more voting power (the calculator is available on Kalmy.APP, more locks info is as well available in docs).\n\nIt is also important to notice that KalmySwap is an AMM aggregator. This means that initially all new and current LPs would be allocated on PancakeSwap; therefore, the liquidity will be available for trade on both KalmySwap and PancakeSwap â€“ effectively maximizing the amount of users that could actually access liquidity and generate trading fees.\n\nHere is a bit more of the introduction: https://blog.kalmar.io/lp-wars-introduction/\n\nNow, for the test week, we will be using the current 6 LPs KALM rewards. At the same time, we are considering to further reduce our KALM emissions (inflation) rate as well as reduce the daily bonds number. This means that LP Wars available weekly rewards might (and likely will change).\n\nFor the test purpose, we are using some of the classics mixed in with some KALM fun. So, OGs â€“ please, vote. Community â€“ please, start sharing the word. Projects that are early â€“ don't miss your chance to accumulate some juice for your community before mass FOMO kicks in.\n\nLet's amplify the fun, shall we?",

      "content": "Welcome to LP Wars. Again. This is a new important chapter of Kalmy.APP ecosystem.\n\nWithin our long term commitment of creating the ultimate DeFi ecosystem empowered by NFT, we are introducing a new low risk DeFi product for Kalmy â€“ a liquidity layer for all quality BNB projects (if tests are success â€“Â we dive into more chains).\n\nThis new Kalmy product is a combination of Yearn Finance, Curve, and strict whitelisting for user's safety. On one side, this is a traditional auto-compound product for LPs (if tests are success â€“ for vaults like staking). An example would be a PanCake or BiSwap LP that gets CAKE/BSW rewards auto-compounded with KALM rewards on top.\n\nOn another side, there are votes (wars) that run weekly (or biweekly, considering the tests feedback); the KALM rewards on top of CAKE/BSW are decided by the vote results. It is important to note that any quality LP could be whitelisted, so the liquidity that currently only earns trading fees (no CAKE/BSW/BAKE/other rewards), could start earning KALM just with voting.\n\nOverall, the protocol itself also reviews a Solidly protocol logic, acting as a liquidity layer for projects that do not have farms. This as well becomes an alternative for community farms where projects are traditionally \"paying\" for a non-continuous farm without a predictable schedule by project's leads. \n\nIn Kalmy LP Wars case, the predictable rewards are on a rolling basis and are coming from weekly votes. On top, any user is free to vote for any whitelisted farm. As always, locking KALM gives more voting power (the calculator is available on Kalmy.APP, more locks info is as well available in docs).\n\nIt is also important to notice that KalmySwap is an AMM aggregator. This means that initially all new and current LPs would be allocated on PancakeSwap; therefore, the liquidity will be available for trade on both KalmySwap and PancakeSwap â€“ effectively maximizing the amount of users that could actually access liquidity and generate trading fees.\n\nHere is a bit more of the introduction: https://blog.kalmar.io/lp-wars-introduction/\n\nNow, for the test week, we will be using the current 6 LPs KALM rewards. At the same time, we are considering to further reduce our KALM emissions (inflation) rate as well as reduce the daily bonds number. This means that LP Wars available weekly rewards might (and likely will change).\n\nFor the test purpose, we are using some of the classics mixed in with some KALM fun. So, OGs â€“ please, vote. Community â€“ please, start sharing the word. Projects that are early â€“ don't miss your chance to accumulate some juice for your community before mass FOMO kicks in.\n\nLet's amplify the fun, shall we?",

      "title": "LP Wars Alpha. Vote 10.",
      "content": "Welcome to LP Wars. Again. This is a new important chapter of Kalmy.APP ecosystem.\n\nWithin our long term commitment of creating the ultimate DeFi ecosystem empowered by NFT, we are introducing a new low risk DeFi product for Kalmy â€“ a liquidity layer for all quality BNB projects (if tests are success â€“Â we dive into more chains).\n\nThis new Kalmy product is a combination of Yearn Finance, Curve, and strict whitelisting for user's safety. On one side, this is a traditional auto-compound product for LPs (if tests are success â€“ for vaults like staking). An example would be a PanCake or BiSwap LP that gets CAKE/BSW rewards auto-compounded with KALM rewards on top.\n\nOn another side, there are votes (wars) that run weekly (or biweekly, considering the tests feedback); the KALM rewards on top of CAKE/BSW are decided by the vote results. It is important to note that any quality LP could be whitelisted, so the liquidity that currently only earns trading fees (no CAKE/BSW/BAKE/other rewards), could start earning KALM just with voting.\n\nOverall, the protocol itself also reviews a Solidly protocol logic, acting as a liquidity layer for projects that do not have farms. This as well becomes an alternative for community farms where projects are traditionally \"paying\" for a non-continuous farm without a predictable schedule by project's leads. \n\nIn Kalmy LP Wars case, the predictable rewards are on a rolling basis and are coming from weekly votes. On top, any user is free to vote for any whitelisted farm. As always, locking KALM gives more voting power (the calculator is available on Kalmy.APP, more locks info is as well available in docs).\n\nIt is also important to notice that KalmySwap is an AMM aggregator. This means that initially all new and current LPs would be allocated on PancakeSwap; therefore, the liquidity will be available for trade on both KalmySwap and PancakeSwap â€“ effectively maximizing the amount of users that could actually access liquidity and generate trading fees.\n\nHere is a bit more of the introduction: https://blog.kalmar.io/lp-wars-introduction/\n\nNow, for the test week, we will be using the current 6 LPs KALM rewards. At the same time, we are considering to further reduce our KALM emissions (inflation) rate as well as reduce the daily bonds number. This means that LP Wars available weekly rewards might (and likely will change).\n\nFor the test purpose, we are using some of the classics mixed in with some KALM fun. So, OGs â€“ please, vote. Community â€“ please, start sharing the word. Projects that are early â€“ don't miss your chance to accumulate some juice for your community before mass FOMO kicks in.\n\nLet's amplify the fun, shall we?",

      "title": "LP Wars Alpha. Vote 9.",
      "content": "Welcome to LP Wars. Again. This is a new important chapter of Kalmy.APP ecosystem.\n\nWithin our long term commitment of creating the ultimate DeFi ecosystem empowered by NFT, we are introducing a new low risk DeFi product for Kalmy â€“ a liquidity layer for all quality BNB projects (if tests are success â€“Â we dive into more chains).\n\nThis new Kalmy product is a combination of Yearn Finance, Curve, and strict whitelisting for user's safety. On one side, this is a traditional auto-compound product for LPs (if tests are success â€“ for vaults like staking). An example would be a PanCake or BiSwap LP that gets CAKE/BSW rewards auto-compounded with KALM rewards on top.\n\nOn another side, there are votes (wars) that run weekly (or biweekly, considering the tests feedback); the KALM rewards on top of CAKE/BSW are decided by the vote results. It is important to note that any quality LP could be whitelisted, so the liquidity that currently only earns trading fees (no CAKE/BSW/BAKE/other rewards), could start earning KALM just with voting.\n\nOverall, the protocol itself also reviews a Solidly protocol logic, acting as a liquidity layer for projects that do not have farms. This as well becomes an alternative for community farms where projects are traditionally \"paying\" for a non-continuous farm without a predictable schedule by project's leads. \n\nIn Kalmy LP Wars case, the predictable rewards are on a rolling basis and are coming from weekly votes. On top, any user is free to vote for any whitelisted farm. As always, locking KALM gives more voting power (the calculator is available on Kalmy.APP, more locks info is as well available in docs).\n\nIt is also important to notice that KalmySwap is an AMM aggregator. This means that initially all new and current LPs would be allocated on PancakeSwap; therefore, the liquidity will be available for trade on both KalmySwap and PancakeSwap â€“ effectively maximizing the amount of users that could actually access liquidity and generate trading fees.\n\nHere is a bit more of the introduction: https://blog.kalmar.io/lp-wars-introduction/\n\nNow, for the test week, we will be using the current 6 LPs KALM rewards. At the same time, we are considering to further reduce our KALM emissions (inflation) rate as well as reduce the daily bonds number. This means that LP Wars available weekly rewards might (and likely will change).\n\nFor the test purpose, we are using some of the classics mixed in with some KALM fun. So, OGs â€“ please, vote. Community â€“ please, start sharing the word. Projects that are early â€“ don't miss your chance to accumulate some juice for your community before mass FOMO kicks in.\n\nLet's amplify the fun, shall we?",

      "title": "LP Wars Alpha. Vote 8.",
      "content": "Welcome to LP Wars. Again. This is a new important chapter of Kalmy.APP ecosystem.\n\nWithin our long term commitment of creating the ultimate DeFi ecosystem empowered by NFT, we are introducing a new low risk DeFi product for Kalmy â€“ a liquidity layer for all quality BNB projects (if tests are success â€“Â we dive into more chains).\n\nThis new Kalmy product is a combination of Yearn Finance, Curve, and strict whitelisting for user's safety. On one side, this is a traditional auto-compound product for LPs (if tests are success â€“ for vaults like staking). An example would be a PanCake or BiSwap LP that gets CAKE/BSW rewards auto-compounded with KALM rewards on top.\n\nOn another side, there are votes (wars) that run weekly (or biweekly, considering the tests feedback); the KALM rewards on top of CAKE/BSW are decided by the vote results. It is important to note that any quality LP could be whitelisted, so the liquidity that currently only earns trading fees (no CAKE/BSW/BAKE/other rewards), could start earning KALM just with voting.\n\nOverall, the protocol itself also reviews a Solidly protocol logic, acting as a liquidity layer for projects that do not have farms. This as well becomes an alternative for community farms where projects are traditionally \"paying\" for a non-continuous farm without a predictable schedule by project's leads. \n\nIn Kalmy LP Wars case, the predictable rewards are on a rolling basis and are coming from weekly votes. On top, any user is free to vote for any whitelisted farm. As always, locking KALM gives more voting power (the calculator is available on Kalmy.APP, more locks info is as well available in docs).\n\nIt is also important to notice that KalmySwap is an AMM aggregator. This means that initially all new and current LPs would be allocated on PancakeSwap; therefore, the liquidity will be available for trade on both KalmySwap and PancakeSwap â€“ effectively maximizing the amount of users that could actually access liquidity and generate trading fees.\n\nHere is a bit more of the introduction: https://blog.kalmar.io/lp-wars-introduction/\n\nNow, for the test week, we will be using the current 6 LPs KALM rewards. At the same time, we are considering to further reduce our KALM emissions (inflation) rate as well as reduce the daily bonds number. This means that LP Wars available weekly rewards might (and likely will change).\n\nFor the test purpose, we are using some of the classics mixed in with some KALM fun. So, OGs â€“ please, vote. Community â€“ please, start sharing the word. Projects that are early â€“ don't miss your chance to accumulate some juice for your community before mass FOMO kicks in.\n\nLet's amplify the fun, shall we?",

      "title": "LP Wars Alpha. Vote 7.",
      "content": "Welcome to LP Wars. Again. This is a new important chapter of Kalmy.APP ecosystem.\n\nWithin our long term commitment of creating the ultimate DeFi ecosystem empowered by NFT, we are introducing a new low risk DeFi product for Kalmy â€“ a liquidity layer for all quality BNB projects (if tests are success â€“Â we dive into more chains).\n\nThis new Kalmy product is a combination of Yearn Finance, Curve, and strict whitelisting for user's safety. On one side, this is a traditional auto-compound product for LPs (if tests are success â€“ for vaults like staking). An example would be a PanCake or BiSwap LP that gets CAKE/BSW rewards auto-compounded with KALM rewards on top.\n\nOn another side, there are votes (wars) that run weekly (or biweekly, considering the tests feedback); the KALM rewards on top of CAKE/BSW are decided by the vote results. It is important to note that any quality LP could be whitelisted, so the liquidity that currently only earns trading fees (no CAKE/BSW/BAKE/other rewards), could start earning KALM just with voting.\n\nOverall, the protocol itself also reviews a Solidly protocol logic, acting as a liquidity layer for projects that do not have farms. This as well becomes an alternative for community farms where projects are traditionally \"paying\" for a non-continuous farm without a predictable schedule by project's leads. \n\nIn Kalmy LP Wars case, the predictable rewards are on a rolling basis and are coming from weekly votes. On top, any user is free to vote for any whitelisted farm. As always, locking KALM gives more voting power (the calculator is available on Kalmy.APP, more locks info is as well available in docs).\n\nIt is also important to notice that KalmySwap is an AMM aggregator. This means that initially all new and current LPs would be allocated on PancakeSwap; therefore, the liquidity will be available for trade on both KalmySwap and PancakeSwap â€“ effectively maximizing the amount of users that could actually access liquidity and generate trading fees.\n\nHere is a bit more of the introduction: https://blog.kalmar.io/lp-wars-introduction/\n\nNow, for the test week, we will be using the current 6 LPs KALM rewards. At the same time, we are considering to further reduce our KALM emissions (inflation) rate as well as reduce the daily bonds number. This means that LP Wars available weekly rewards might (and likely will change).\n\nFor the test purpose, we are using some of the classics mixed in with some KALM fun. So, OGs â€“ please, vote. Community â€“ please, start sharing the word. Projects that are early â€“ don't miss your chance to accumulate some juice for your community before mass FOMO kicks in.\n\nLet's amplify the fun, shall we?",

      "title": "LP Wars Alpha. Vote 6.",
      "content": "Welcome to LP Wars. Again. This is a new important chapter of Kalmy.APP ecosystem.\n\nWithin our long term commitment of creating the ultimate DeFi ecosystem empowered by NFT, we are introducing a new low risk DeFi product for Kalmy â€“ a liquidity layer for all quality BNB projects (if tests are success â€“Â we dive into more chains).\n\nThis new Kalmy product is a combination of Yearn Finance, Curve, and strict whitelisting for user's safety. On one side, this is a traditional auto-compound product for LPs (if tests are success â€“ for vaults like staking). An example would be a PanCake or BiSwap LP that gets CAKE/BSW rewards auto-compounded with KALM rewards on top.\n\nOn another side, there are votes (wars) that run weekly (or biweekly, considering the tests feedback); the KALM rewards on top of CAKE/BSW are decided by the vote results. It is important to note that any quality LP could be whitelisted, so the liquidity that currently only earns trading fees (no CAKE/BSW/BAKE/other rewards), could start earning KALM just with voting.\n\nOverall, the protocol itself also reviews a Solidly protocol logic, acting as a liquidity layer for projects that do not have farms. This as well becomes an alternative for community farms where projects are traditionally \"paying\" for a non-continuous farm without a predictable schedule by project's leads. \n\nIn Kalmy LP Wars case, the predictable rewards are on a rolling basis and are coming from weekly votes. On top, any user is free to vote for any whitelisted farm. As always, locking KALM gives more voting power (the calculator is available on Kalmy.APP, more locks info is as well available in docs).\n\nIt is also important to notice that KalmySwap is an AMM aggregator. This means that initially all new and current LPs would be allocated on PancakeSwap; therefore, the liquidity will be available for trade on both KalmySwap and PancakeSwap â€“ effectively maximizing the amount of users that could actually access liquidity and generate trading fees.\n\nHere is a bit more of the introduction: https://blog.kalmar.io/lp-wars-introduction/\n\nNow, for the test week, we will be using the current 6 LPs KALM rewards. At the same time, we are considering to further reduce our KALM emissions (inflation) rate as well as reduce the daily bonds number. This means that LP Wars available weekly rewards might (and likely will change).\n\nFor the test purpose, we are using some of the classics mixed in with some KALM fun. So, OGs â€“ please, vote. Community â€“ please, start sharing the word. Projects that are early â€“ don't miss your chance to accumulate some juice for your community before mass FOMO kicks in.\n\nLet's amplify the fun, shall we?",

      "title": "LP Wars Alpha. Vote 5.",
      "content": "Welcome to LP Wars. Again. This is a new important chapter of Kalmy.APP ecosystem.\n\nWithin our long term commitment of creating the ultimate DeFi ecosystem empowered by NFT, we are introducing a new low risk DeFi product for Kalmy â€“ a liquidity layer for all quality BNB projects (if tests are success â€“Â we dive into more chains).\n\nThis new Kalmy product is a combination of Yearn Finance, Curve, and strict whitelisting for user's safety. On one side, this is a traditional auto-compound product for LPs (if tests are success â€“ for vaults like staking). An example would be a PanCake or BiSwap LP that gets CAKE/BSW rewards auto-compounded with KALM rewards on top.\n\nOn another side, there are votes (wars) that run weekly (or biweekly, considering the tests feedback); the KALM rewards on top of CAKE/BSW are decided by the vote results. It is important to note that any quality LP could be whitelisted, so the liquidity that currently only earns trading fees (no CAKE/BSW/BAKE/other rewards), could start earning KALM just with voting.\n\nOverall, the protocol itself also reviews a Solidly protocol logic, acting as a liquidity layer for projects that do not have farms. This as well becomes an alternative for community farms where projects are traditionally \"paying\" for a non-continuous farm without a predictable schedule by project's leads. \n\nIn Kalmy LP Wars case, the predictable rewards are on a rolling basis and are coming from weekly votes. On top, any user is free to vote for any whitelisted farm. As always, locking KALM gives more voting power (the calculator is available on Kalmy.APP, more locks info is as well available in docs).\n\nIt is also important to notice that KalmySwap is an AMM aggregator. This means that initially all new and current LPs would be allocated on PancakeSwap; therefore, the liquidity will be available for trade on both KalmySwap and PancakeSwap â€“ effectively maximizing the amount of users that could actually access liquidity and generate trading fees.\n\nHere is a bit more of the introduction: https://blog.kalmar.io/lp-wars-introduction/\n\nNow, for the test week, we will be using the current 6 LPs KALM rewards. At the same time, we are considering to further reduce our KALM emissions (inflation) rate as well as reduce the daily bonds number. This means that LP Wars available weekly rewards might (and likely will change).\n\nFor the test purpose, we are using some of the classics mixed in with some KALM fun. So, OGs â€“ please, vote. Community â€“ please, start sharing the word. Projects that are early â€“ don't miss your chance to accumulate some juice for your community before mass FOMO kicks in.\n\nLet's amplify the fun, shall we?",

      "title": "LP Wars Alpha. Vote 4.",
      "content": "Welcome to LP Wars. Again. This is a new important chapter of Kalmy.APP ecosystem.\n\nWithin our long term commitment of creating the ultimate DeFi ecosystem empowered by NFT, we are introducing a new low risk DeFi product for Kalmy â€“ a liquidity layer for all quality BNB projects (if tests are success â€“Â we dive into more chains).\n\nThis new Kalmy product is a combination of Yearn Finance, Curve, and strict whitelisting for user's safety. On one side, this is a traditional auto-compound product for LPs (if tests are success â€“ for vaults like staking). An example would be a PanCake or BiSwap LP that gets CAKE/BSW rewards auto-compounded with KALM rewards on top.\n\nOn another side, there are votes (wars) that run weekly (or biweekly, considering the tests feedback); the KALM rewards on top of CAKE/BSW are decided by the vote results. It is important to note that any quality LP could be whitelisted, so the liquidity that currently only earns trading fees (no CAKE/BSW/BAKE/other rewards), could start earning KALM just with voting.\n\nOverall, the protocol itself also reviews a Solidly protocol logic, acting as a liquidity layer for projects that do not have farms. This as well becomes an alternative for community farms where projects are traditionally \"paying\" for a non-continuous farm without a predictable schedule by project's leads. \n\nIn Kalmy LP Wars case, the predictable rewards are on a rolling basis and are coming from weekly votes. On top, any user is free to vote for any whitelisted farm. As always, locking KALM gives more voting power (the calculator is available on Kalmy.APP, more locks info is as well available in docs).\n\nIt is also important to notice that KalmySwap is an AMM aggregator. This means that initially all new and current LPs would be allocated on PancakeSwap; therefore, the liquidity will be available for trade on both KalmySwap and PancakeSwap â€“ effectively maximizing the amount of users that could actually access liquidity and generate trading fees.\n\nHere is a bit more of the introduction: https://blog.kalmar.io/lp-wars-introduction/\n\nNow, for the test week, we will be using the current 6 LPs KALM rewards. At the same time, we are considering to further reduce our KALM emissions (inflation) rate as well as reduce the daily bonds number. This means that LP Wars available weekly rewards might (and likely will change).\n\nFor the test purpose, we are using some of the classics mixed in with some KALM fun. So, OGs â€“ please, vote. Community â€“ please, start sharing the word. Projects that are early â€“ don't miss your chance to accumulate some juice for your community before mass FOMO kicks in.\n\nLet's amplify the fun, shall we?",

      "title": "LP Wars Alpha. Vote 3.",
      "content": "Welcome to LP Wars. Again. This is a new important chapter of Kalmy.APP ecosystem.\n\nWithin our long term commitment of creating the ultimate DeFi ecosystem empowered by NFT, we are introducing a new low risk DeFi product for Kalmy â€“ a liquidity layer for all quality BNB projects (if tests are success â€“Â we dive into more chains).\n\nThis new Kalmy product is a combination of Yearn Finance, Curve, and strict whitelisting for user's safety. On one side, this is a traditional auto-compound product for LPs (if tests are success â€“ for vaults like staking). An example would be a PanCake or BiSwap LP that gets CAKE/BSW rewards auto-compounded with KALM rewards on top.\n\nOn another side, there are votes (wars) that run weekly (or biweekly, considering the tests feedback); the KALM rewards on top of CAKE/BSW are decided by the vote results. It is important to note that any quality LP could be whitelisted, so the liquidity that currently only earns trading fees (no CAKE/BSW/BAKE/other rewards), could start earning KALM just with voting.\n\nOverall, the protocol itself also reviews a Solidly protocol logic, acting as a liquidity layer for projects that do not have farms. This as well becomes an alternative for community farms where projects are traditionally \"paying\" for a non-continuous farm without a predictable schedule by project's leads. \n\nIn Kalmy LP Wars case, the predictable rewards are on a rolling basis and are coming from weekly votes. On top, any user is free to vote for any whitelisted farm. As always, locking KALM gives more voting power (the calculator is available on Kalmy.APP, more locks info is as well available in docs).\n\nIt is also important to notice that KalmySwap is an AMM aggregator. This means that initially all new and current LPs would be allocated on PancakeSwap; therefore, the liquidity will be available for trade on both KalmySwap and PancakeSwap â€“ effectively maximizing the amount of users that could actually access liquidity and generate trading fees.\n\nHere is a bit more of the introduction: https://blog.kalmar.io/lp-wars-introduction/\n\nNow, for the test week, we will be using the current 6 LPs KALM rewards. At the same time, we are considering to further reduce our KALM emissions (inflation) rate as well as reduce the daily bonds number. This means that LP Wars available weekly rewards might (and likely will change).\n\nFor the test purpose, we are using some of the classics mixed in with some KALM fun. So, OGs â€“ please, vote. Community â€“ please, start sharing the word. Projects that are early â€“ don't miss your chance to accumulate some juice for your community before mass FOMO kicks in.\n\nLet's amplify the fun, shall we?",

      "title": "LP Wars Alpha. Vote 2.",
      "content": "Welcome to LP Wars. Again. This is a new important chapter of Kalmy.APP ecosystem.\n\nWithin our long term commitment of creating the ultimate DeFi ecosystem empowered by NFT, we are introducing a new low risk DeFi product for Kalmy â€“ a liquidity layer for all quality BNB projects (if tests are success â€“Â we dive into more chains).\n\nThis new Kalmy product is a combination of Yearn Finance, Curve, and strict whitelisting for user's safety. On one side, this is a traditional auto-compound product for LPs (if tests are success â€“ for vaults like staking). An example would be a PanCake or BiSwap LP that gets CAKE/BSW rewards auto-compounded with KALM rewards on top.\n\nOn another side, there are votes (wars) that run weekly (or biweekly, considering the tests feedback); the KALM rewards on top of CAKE/BSW are decided by the vote results. It is important to note that any quality LP could be whitelisted, so the liquidity that currently only earns trading fees (no CAKE/BSW/BAKE/other rewards), could start earning KALM just with voting.\n\nOverall, the protocol itself also reviews a Solidly protocol logic, acting as a liquidity layer for projects that do not have farms. This as well becomes an alternative for community farms where projects are traditionally \"paying\" for a non-continuous farm without a predictable schedule by project's leads. \n\nIn Kalmy LP Wars case, the predictable rewards are on a rolling basis and are coming from weekly votes. On top, any user is free to vote for any whitelisted farm. As always, locking KALM gives more voting power (the calculator is available on Kalmy.APP, more locks info is as well available in docs).\n\nIt is also important to notice that KalmySwap is an AMM aggregator. This means that initially all new and current LPs would be allocated on PancakeSwap; therefore, the liquidity will be available for trade on both KalmySwap and PancakeSwap â€“ effectively maximizing the amount of users that could actually access liquidity and generate trading fees.\n\nHere is a bit more of the introduction: https://blog.kalmar.io/lp-wars-introduction/\n\nNow, for the test week, we will be using the current 6 LPs KALM rewards. At the same time, we are considering to further reduce our KALM emissions (inflation) rate as well as reduce the daily bonds number. This means that LP Wars available weekly rewards might (and likely will change).\n\nFor the test purpose, we are using some of the classics mixed in with some KALM fun. So, OGs â€“ please, vote. Community â€“ please, start sharing the word. Projects that are early â€“ don't miss your chance to accumulate some juice for your community before mass FOMO kicks in.\n\nLet's amplify the fun, shall we?",

      "title": "LP Wars Alpha Pilot Test. Vote 1.",
      "content": "Welcome to LP Wars. Again. This is a new important chapter of Kalmy.APP ecosystem.\n\nWithin our long term commitment of creating the ultimate DeFi ecosystem empowered by NFT, we are introducing a new low risk DeFi product for Kalmy â€“ a liquidity layer for all quality BNB projects (if tests are success â€“Â we dive into more chains).\n\nThis new Kalmy product is a combination of Yearn Finance, Curve, and strict whitelisting for user's safety. On one side, this is a traditional auto-compound product for LPs (if tests are success â€“ for vaults like staking). An example would be a PanCake or BiSwap LP that gets CAKE/BSW rewards auto-compounded with KALM rewards on top.\n\nOn another side, there are votes (wars) that run weekly (or biweekly, considering the tests feedback); the KALM rewards on top of CAKE/BSW are decided by the vote results. It is important to note that any quality LP could be whitelisted, so the liquidity that currently only earns trading fees (no CAKE/BSW/BAKE/other rewards), could start earning KALM just with voting.\n\nOverall, the protocol itself also reviews a Solidly protocol logic, acting as a liquidity layer for projects that do not have farms. This as well becomes an alternative for community farms where projects are traditionally \"paying\" for a non-continuous farm without a predictable schedule by project's leads. \n\nIn Kalmy LP Wars case, the predictable rewards are on a rolling basis and are coming from weekly votes. On top, any user is free to vote for any whitelisted farm. As always, locking KALM gives more voting power (the calculator is available on Kalmy.APP, more locks info is as well available in docs).\n\nIt is also important to notice that KalmySwap is an AMM aggregator. This means that initially all new and current LPs would be allocated on PancakeSwap; therefore, the liquidity will be available for trade on both KalmySwap and PancakeSwap â€“ effectively maximizing the amount of users that could actually access liquidity and generate trading fees.\n\nHere is a bit more of the introduction: https://blog.kalmar.io/lp-wars-introduction/\n\nNow, for the test week, we will be using the current 6 LPs KALM rewards. At the same time, we are considering to further reduce our KALM emissions (inflation) rate as well as reduce the daily bonds number. This means that LP Wars available weekly rewards might (and likely will change).\n\nFor the test purpose, we are using some of the classics mixed in with some KALM fun. So, OGs â€“ please, vote. Community â€“ please, start sharing the word. Projects that are early â€“ don't miss your chance to accumulate some juice for your community before mass FOMO kicks in.\n\nLet's amplify the fun, shall we?",

      "content": "Welcome to LP Wars. This is a new important chapter of Kalmy.APP ecosystem.\n\nWithin our long term commitment of creating the ultimate DeFi ecosystem empowered by NFT, we are introducing a new low risk DeFi product for Kalmy â€“ a liquidity layer for all quality BNB projects (if tests are success â€“Â we dive into more chains).\n\nThis new Kalmy product is a combination of Yearn Finance, Curve, and strict whitelisting for user's safety. On one side, this is a traditional auto-compound product for LPs (if tests are success â€“ for vaults like staking). An example would be a PanCake or BiSwap LP that gets CAKE/BSW rewards auto-compounded with KALM rewards on top.\n\nOn another side, there are votes (wars) that run weekly (or biweekly, considering the tests feedback); the KALM rewards on top of CAKE/BSW are decided by the vote results. It is important to note that any quality LP could be whitelisted, so the liquidity that currently only earns trading fees (no CAKE/BSW/BAKE/other rewards), could start earning KALM just with voting.\n\nOverall, the protocol itself also reviews a Solidly protocol logic, acting as a liquidity layer for projects that do not have farms. This as well becomes an alternative for community farms where projects are traditionally \"paying\" for a non-continuous farm without a predictable schedule by project's leads. \n\nIn Kalmy LP Wars case, the predictable rewards are on a rolling basis and are coming from weekly votes. On top, any user is free to vote for any whitelisted farm. As always, locking KALM gives more voting power (the calculator is available on Kalmy.APP, more locks info is as well available in docs).\n\nIt is also important to notice that KalmySwap is an AMM aggregator. This means that initially all new and current LPs would be allocated on PancakeSwap; therefore, the liquidity will be available for trade on both KalmySwap and PancakeSwap â€“ effectively maximizing the amount of users that could actually access liquidity and generate trading fees.\n\nHere is a bit more of the introduction: https://blog.kalmar.io/lp-wars-introduction/\n\nNow, for the test week, we will be using the current 6 LPs KALM rewards. At the same time, we are considering to further reduce our KALM emissions (inflation) rate as well as reduce the daily bonds number. This means that LP Wars available weekly rewards might (and likely will change).\n\nFor the test purpose, we are using some of the classics mixed in with some KALM fun. So, OGs â€“ please, vote. Community â€“ please, start sharing the word. Projects that are early â€“ don't miss your chance to accumulate some juice for your community before mass FOMO kicks in.\n\nLet's amplify the fun, shall we?",

The first place gets 100 slots, the second gets 50, and the third gets 30 freemints.\n\nThose could be redeemed on a first come - first serve basis. The whitelist (can be earned for being active on socials) gives a chance to skip the line.\n\nAs always, locking provides the most voting power.\n\nThat's it, use your KALM wisely.",
