      "title": "Season 3 “The Reboot”",
      "content": "\nThe creator´s ecosystem has evolved significantly in the last 6 months. Creator´s are looking into a myriad of tools, DAOs and blockchain to learn and understand how they can leverage web3 technologies and communities to sustain their art and launch projects.\nIn this context we propose to evolve the mission of mClub to cultivate a supportive ecosystem where creators get inspired and learn how to use web3 to give them more creative independence and build an engaged loyal community of fans. \nThe vision is to create a space where creators come confused and isolated, but leave inspired, equipped, connected and motivated. \n\nOur north star is to position mClub as the \"go-to\" DAO for creators who want to use web3 to get more creative independence and build an engaged loyal community of fans. \n\n**Why a “reboot”?**\nTo execute against that mission new process and infrastructure needs to be put in place to re-engage with mClub members and attract the creator ecosystem to participate in mClub’s evolved mission.\n\n**How We Support Creators**\n*Financial capital:* Grant ETH and/or tokens to worthy projects, increasing their chances of success and creating long term alignment with our DAO.\n*Social capital:* Cultivate a supportive ecosystem where creators get inspired, build connections and a network of care while learning how to use web3 to give them more creative independence and build an engaged loyal community of fans.\n*Project support:* Give project feedback and guidance as needed through our emerging programs and collaborators. \n\n**Season 3  Goals**\n*Goal 1*  - Launch mClub rebranding with Artist in Residence program.\nHost the first mClub Artist in Residence program with the goal of designing with the community a new brand that express mClub new evolved mission to be the go-to DAO for creators who want to build their web3 community and learn how to use web3 tools to share ownership of their work with their community.\nBudget request: Grant for creator in residence\n1.5 Eth + 100 $mClub\n\n*Goal 2* - Partner with the ecosystem to build and run creator´s empowering programs\nTo expand the impact and awareness of mClub we propose to partner with creators, projects and protocols to host activities to support and empower creators like networking events, workshops, speakers host, etc as a complimentary tool of the Creator´s Hours. \nBudget request: Compensation for speakers and hosts. We aim to find grants that will help us finance these efforts, in case grants are issued to mClub the treasury budget will be subtracted from this request.\nMin: 1.5Eth - 500 $mclub \nMax: 3 Eth - 1500 $mclub\n\n*Goal 3* - Engage first cohort of mProducers\nTo cultivate this supportive environment we need passionate people who care about creators and get excited about what is possible. Therefore we will be onboarding the first few mProducers to help the core team build out the ecosystem. \nWe will open up mProducer roles to a maximum of 3 people for Season 3. \nThe purpose of mProducers is to:\n- Form the community and cultural leadership for different north star projects like engaging the community and working with mDirectors to think of innovative ways to support creators on their web3 journey. \n- Ensure all “core” processes and initiatives are in place to build the go-to DAO for creators who want to build their web3 community and learn how to use web3 tools to share ownership of their work with their community.\n\nCompensation will distributed in mclub tokens as follows: \nEach week 50mClub tokens per mProducer will be awarded for a total of 6 weeks. \n\nmClub tokens will be distributed at the end of the season. \n-If an mclub producer comes on board with 4 weeks remaining they will receive 200mClub tokens at the end of the season.\nBudget request: \nMax: 1200mClub tokens. \nMin: 0 mClub tokens\n\n*How long does this season last?*\n6 to 8 weeks\n\n*Why?*\nIt’s short enough to encourage a sense of urgency and execution. But not long enough for things to stall. Also we are a small team that can move nimbly. \n\nWhat’s the total budget for the Season? \n\n\nMin: 1.600 $mclub - 3 ETH (it can be less ETH in case mClub get access to ecosystem grants)\nMax: 4.600 $mclub - 4.5 ETH\n\nWhy to vote Yes?\n- If you believe mClub should serve the broader creator ecosystem.\n- If you believe mClub should relaunch and for example own his own discord.\n\nWhy to vote No?\n- If you prefer mClub just support creators on the Mirror.xyz Platform.\n- If you feel mClub is functioning well as it is today.\n",

      "content": "\nMotivation\n\nWhat is Unnamed Fund?\n\nUnnamed Fund is a cooperatively-controlled creative ecosystem fund that seeks to re-imagine existing models for funding creative, artistic, and entrepreneurial projects by sustaining those underserved by traditional funding through the equitable distribution of capital, across multiple impact outcomes. \n\nThe Unnamed Fund grew out of NEW INC, an incubator fueled by the New Museum in New York City. NEW INC hosts an inspiring community of forward-thinking creative and social entrepreneurs, often working on meaningful projects where social or impact returns are prioritized over financial returns and is spearheaded by several alumni.\n\nWhat is what we would be funding?\n\nUnnamed is launching their first experiment in community-distributed grant making, they are seeking to raise $10k in ETH to distribute to NEW INC creative community using quadratic voting, and a frictionless application pipeline.\n\nMore information here: https://unnamedfund.mirror.xyz/crowdfunds/0x0BE43d085A0610869457F812c108963eB298A5a7\n\n\nWhy is it important to support this project? \n\nThe ecosystem around creators and web3 has changed considerably in the last 6 months. Creators are using a myriad of different tools and experimentation methods that require support from the web3 community to discover new frontiers and lay groundwork of how creators can better use web3 tools to build, communicate and support their work.\n\nMany web3 communities are focusing their efforts in supporting creators the same way as we do. We aim to support creators from mClub programmatic services and community development but also by supporting projects that are helping creators from complementary angles and visions.\n\n\n\nHow does it help move forward  our mission?\n\n- Supporting Unnamed Fund will help us achieve our mission by:  \nIncreasing the opportunity of onboarding new creators into the ecosystem and with more chances of survival.\n- Learning first hand the experience of running this type of experiment as an input for our future programs. \n- Building social and brand capital for mClub in the ecosystem that will help us reach awareness about our mission and attract new members and contributors.\n\n\nProposed funding\n\n2 ETH in exchange of $UNNAMED token signaling our core partnership\n\n",

      "title": "Proposal to hire 2 Core Team members",
      "content": "Authors: John (@silkeyj), Clavis\n\nSummary\nCreate formal roles with clear minimum responsibilities to lead mClub’s next phase of growth.\n\nFull proposal here. https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jRs7L4V7rRf-S-sAbQ-46NXfnep9_ckZLbR5NmpHN4Y/edit?usp=sharing\n\nMotivation \nmClub is poised to grow its active membership in Season 3, which will require more time and leadership from a few key contributors. We now have the alignment of need (committed leadership to help mClub grow) and opportunity (to prototype mClub’s first part-time to full-time, paid roles). \n\nThis core team will build on the work completed in Seasons 1 and 2, and use that as a launchpad to grow the mClub contributor community to help scale mCLUB’s purpose to:\n(1) recruit, back, and support creators onto the Mirror platform; \n(2) become a creator platform itself on Mirror to further support its ecosystem and creators; and \n(3) create a learning experience for those interested in creating and working within a DAO.\n\nApproach\nElevate the Curator Lead role to a core team role (see below) and add 2 additional core roles. Together these 3 roles will form the core leadership team of mClub DAO, responsible for facilitating the growing community to create and grow mClub:\n\n-Mirror as a service (MaaS) Lead\n-Community Lead\n\nCommitment and Pay:\n3 months with potential to continue  (2 months for season 3 + 1 month offseason \n1 eth/month + 100 $mClub per month \n\nOversight: \nThe mClub community are the owners of the DAO. At the end of S3 a self-identified review board will facilitate a public review of what was accomplished against the objectives for that season, as well as how well the core team led the community in alignment with mClub’s mission and values. \n\nSelection Details:\nWe have gone through an application process for hiring the core team roles. We got 3 applications in total and recommending Brownrygg as a community lead and Aye as a MAAS a service lead\n\n\nFor - what are the reasons to vote for this?\n\nYou believe that mClub needs dedicated leadership to continue growing, and that leadership should have predictable compensation\nYou agree that the Curator Lead should be upgraded to core team leadership and compensation adjusted accordingly\nYou agree with Brownryggg becoming a Community Lead\nYou agree with Aye becoming a MAAS lead\nYou think mClub can grow and accomplish more with at least three people showing up to do the work every day\n\nAgainst - what are the reasons to vote against this?\n\nYou don’t agree with the responsibilities stated for each role\nYou don’t agree with the compensation level (either too much or too little)\nYou don’t agree with the recommended candidates for Community Lead and MAAS lead\n\n\n",

      "title": "mCLUB's Incentive Structure",
      "content": "### Abstract\nmCLUB has had difficulty attracting and retaining core contributors in season 2. One key reason may be the lack of clarity on mCLUB’s incentive structure. We propose a new incentive structure that is composed of three mechanisms: proposals, bounties, and Coordinape. \n\n### Context \nmCLUB had an initial influx of excitement and energy when it launched, but we’ve had trouble harnessing that energy and translating that into action. As we’ve moved into season 2, we’ve seen some members who were active in season 1 reduce their commitment, as they didn’t see the immediate value of actively contributing or felt forced to bring their talents elsewhere. \n\nWe believe that one of the core issues that needs to be addressed is mCLUB’s incentive structure. \n\n### Principles\nWe have designed an incentive structure with the following principles in mind. \n\n- **Incentivize completion**: we reward completion of work versus activity\n- **Equity**: some people are not in a position to contribute their time and talent to mCLUB without compensation today. Let’s balance the need for liquidity today and incentives for long-term growth. \n\n### Proposed Structure\nWe propose three elements of our incentive structure. \n\n- **Proposal**: mCLUB members can submit proposals for roles (e.g., project manager, editor) or projects that require funding (e.g., curation project)\n- **Bounty**: mCLUB creates a bounty board that mCLUB members and the general public can access and pursue\n- **Coordinape**: mCLUB members provide a retroactive look on a season and reward their peers   \n\n**Proposals**\n- Scope: this can be for roles (e.g., project manager) or for projects (e.g., curation)\n- Who: mCLUB members are eligible to draft proposals for comment and approval from the DAO \n- Currency: mCLUB or ETH \n- Payout Trigger: proposal-dependent. Roles will be time-bound and paid monthly. \n\n**Bounty**\nScope: time-bound, discrete tasks. Smaller in scope than projects that would be considered proposals. \nWho: Open to mCLUB members and general public \nCurrency: mCLUB tokens \nPayout Trigger: upon validation of completed task \n\n**Coordinape** \nScope: the purpose of this is to create a decentralized mechanism to reward contributors over a season \nWho: eligible for mCLUB members \nCurrency: mCLUB tokens \nPayout Trigger: upon completion of Coordinape at the end of the season \n",

      "title": "mCLUB's Curation Program ",
      "content": "### Abstract\nEstablish a curatorial program within mCLUB to highlight topics, creators, and communities that are of interest to mCLUB. \n\n### Motivation \nIn 2021, Mirror has become the go-to place for creators and communities to tell their story, launch campaigns (e.g., Ethereum documentary), raise donations (e.g., CARE packages), start DAOs (e.g., mCLUB; Crypto, Culture, and Society), and more. Access to the platform has been restricted to the ten winners of the weekly $WRITE race campaign, but Mirror opened their platform and tools to the general public on October 5, 2021. With this change, we expect to see a considerable increase in the number of new publications and campaigns on the Mirror platform, \n\nHowever, mirror does not yet have a native ability to discover or search for different campaigns or publications. As a result, it is easy for creators and communities to get lost in the mix if they are not already well connected in the web3 space. Without clear intention, there is a risk that Mirror will inadvertently create an echo chamber that reinforces existing structures that benefit certain types of publications and campaigns at the expense of others being lost and excluded. \n\nThere is an opportunity - and imperative - to shine a spotlight and amplify creators and communities who may not benefit from existing relationships in the web3 space. If we truly believe that talent is universal, but opportunity is not, we have the opportunity for mCLUB to play a curatorial role and provide a platform to certain types of publications or campaigns (as determined by mCLUB members) so that they can get exposed to a broader audience and increase their chances of meeting their campaign / funding goals.  \n\nThis working group is aligned and contributes to mCLUB’s goals:\n(1) recruit, back, and support creators onto the Mirror platform; \n(2) become a creator platform itself on Mirror to further support its ecosystem and creators; and \n(3) create a learning experience for those interested in creating and working within a DAO.\n\nWe have talked to the Mirror team, and they have expressed support and enthusiasm for this program. \n\n### Approach\nWe propose creating a curatorial program for mCLUB for Seasons 2 and 3. The program will be led by a funded position (“Curator”) that will be responsible for leading the curation efforts that are aligned to topics that are of interest to mCLUB. We also propose creating a community-led curation process that rewards mCLUB tokens to people (members and non-members) who contribute potential projects for curation that are then selected.    \n\nWe will use our own Mirror platform to highlight select projects on a regular cadence (e.g., every two weeks). We will leverage mCLUB’s social media channels, our members (e.g., Jess has over 20K followers on Twitter), our relationship with the Mirror team, and Mirror’s own platform to get the word out.  ​\n\n**The Curator Role**\n- Identify and select interesting projects that are aligned to the theme that they’ve selected (e.g., music, social impact, projects from underrepresented creators)\n- Select and reward entries contributed through the bounty program. \n- Write Mirror posts and all social media posts that highlight the projects that have been selected. \n- Experiment with using Mirror’s token race mechanism to engage mCLUB members  \n- Cadence: this is TBD, but we expect that the Curator will write and publish on Mirror every two weeks \n- Note: if the Curator finds that there aren’t enough projects that are aligned to the selected theme, s/he is empowered to update the curation theme \n\n**Bounty Details**:\n- mCLUB members can contribute curation ideas to the Curator\n- If the idea is selected by the Curator, the mCLUB member is rewarded 8 mCLUB tokens\n- The Curator is empowered to update the curation bounty program to better align with the overall intended goals of the Curation program  \n\n**Budget**  \nAssume 4 months (1 month remaining in Season 2, 3 months of Season 3)\nCurator:\n- 0.5 ETH per Curator (part-time role, ~10 hours per week) per month \n- Curator is paid monthly\n- Curator has the option to accept payments in ETH or mCLUB tokens.   \nTotal: 2 ETH  \nBounty:\n- Total: 400 mCLUB tokens for the curation bounty program\n- Assumes 8 tokens per member x 5 selected projects per cycle x 8 cycles + buffer\n\n### Curator Nominations \nWe've received two nominations for the Curator role.  \n- Dave (@iodave) | Social Impact\n- Natalie (@nataliecrue)​ | Equity\n\nFor more info:\n- Dave's responses: https://discord.com/channels/760571352896765962/911427257195692074/913908989539004446\n- Natalie's responses: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1W5zVk49cY5TqSNHBLNmPOPReOmYNBhLNz0vccJfjbkk/edit?usp=sharing ",

He began recording music and assembling a collective of creative minds when resources were scarce. Living in that environment motivated him to work harder.\n\nHe has lost friends, family, and innocence to gun violence at a young age. The gardens originally built in 1944 for World War II veterans have now become his very own battlefield, aka his \"Danger Zone.\" His goal is to eliminate the need for major record labels by distributing a total of 40% in mechanical royalties to top backers as a way to keep the control of the music within the community.\n\nIf this proposal is approved, mCLUB would support Ibn’s project by:\n-Backing the crowdfund with at least 1 ETH. \n-Helping to publicize the crowdfund to reach the 20 ETH goal.\n\nDo you support backing this project?\n",

Onboard new active contributors\n2. Directly support the launch of new projects and/or creators\n3. Become a curator of mirror content, with focus on equity and inclusiveness\n4. Make more clear how we incentivize and recognize contributions\n\n# Committees\n\nThe plan is to continue with our three existing committees for Season 2. Each will continue operating independently but are expected to proactively support our DAO-level objectives, collaborate closely with other committees, and report on their activity at the weekly mCLUB Town Hall. Each committee will again be given an allocation of 1,000 $mCLUB tokens to be distributed to members at the end of the season via Coordinape to recognize contributions. \n\n## Community Committee\n\nThe community committee is responsible for internal DAO operations that support mCLUB and mCLUB members in executing on strategic goals, focusing on fostering and growing a welcoming and supportive environment for the creator community and the broader mCLUB community. \n\n### Season 2 Community Committee Objectives\n\n1. Improve onboarding and streamline time to becoming a core contributor\n2. Improve inbound interest management in #talk-with-mclub\n3. Make it easier for people who can’t attend meetings to stay up to date\n\n## Media Committee\n\nThe media committee is responsible for creating content (internal and external) that supports mCLUB’s mission to recruit, back, and support creators using the Mirror platform, and continues to establish itself as a creator platform on Mirror.\n\n### Season 2 Media Committee Objectives\n\n1. Propose a compensation program\n2. Improve our external presence through consistent publishing on Mirror\n3. Continue establishing presence on major platforms (Twitter, Mirror)\n\n## Governance/Treasury Committee\n\nThe governance committee’s primary responsibility is to help the DAO operate smoothly and efficiently so that the DAO can maximize its impact on the Mirror creator ecosystem.\n\n### Season 2 Governance Committee Objectives\n\n1. Propose a process to allow new members to join our DAO\n2. Propose a structure that better defines and rewards core contributors\n3. Manage treasury with intention and clear goals\n\n## Working Groups\n\nAs needed, working groups will be spun up to execute projects with short-term and well defined outcomes. This season we expect to have working groups for:\n\n- Mirror Entry Curation\n- Mirror Subgraph Creation\n- Mirror Project Support (ex. Not a Drop of Blood)\n\nIf this proposal is approved, mCLUB Season 2 will officially start October 18 and last until Dec 18.\n",

      "content": "\n# What is mCLUB?\n\n**Mission**\n\nmCLUB aims to:\n\n(1) recruit, back, and support creators onto the Mirror platform;\n\n(2) become a creator platform itself on Mirror to further support its ecosystem and creators; and\n\n(3) create a learning experience for those interested in creating and working within a DAO.\n\n**Why Mirror?**\n\nMirror is more than a publishing platform – it provides tools for web3 native businesses. Backing creators on Mirror allows mCLUB to support creators while also creating mutually beneficial relationships that are positive-sum for the ecosystem.\n\n**How mCLUB Supports Creators**\n\n(1) **Financial capital** - funds raised by the DAO or treasury tokens that could be granted to creators.\n\n(2) **Social capital** - supporting the creator on Twitter and social media, DAO members reading and responding, sharing creator ideas publicly by DAO members.\n\n(3) **DAO members specific support** - special guidance by the DAO members with specialties in specific fields such as fund raising, media, acquiring audience, technical things like dealing with NFTs, etc.\n\n# mCLUB Season One\n\n**What is a “Season”?**\n\nA season is a discrete period of time when mCLUB members can come together to align on projects and experiments that help us in achieving our broader mission.\n\n**mCLUB Season One Vote**\n\nThe mCLUB Season One vote to approve mCLUB Season One will be done using Snapshot. If approved, mCLUB Season One will officially start August 1.

Each will operate independently, reporting out and collaborating at the weekly mCLUB Town Hall. Each committee will also be granted a budget for Season 1 of 1,000 $mCLUB tokens. These tokens will be spent during Season 1 to recognize and reward work toward projects as identified and decided upon by that specific committee. Any unspent tokens within each committee will be rolled over within that committee to be used by that committee in future seasons.\n\n# Community Committee\n\nThe community committee’s goal is to foster a learning experience for people interested in creating and working within a DAO and help contributors of all experience levels learn and gain further experience working within a DAO. mCommunity is responsible for internal DAO operations that support mCLUB and mCLUB members in executing on strategic goals and will focus on fostering and growing a welcoming and supportive environment for the creator community, and the broader mClub community.\n\n**Season One Community Committee Objectives**\n\n- mCommunity: team and project management framework defined (i.e. meeting cadence, roles and responsibilities, action plan etc.)\n- Creators: recruit and onboard at least two creators interested in using Mirror\n- Creators: Create a “hero’s journey” process with checkin cadences, milestones, programs, etc.\n- mClub: Build process and norms to improve cross-team communications and function\n\n# Media Committee\n\nThe media committee is responsible for creating content (internally and externally) that supports mCLUB’s mission to recruit, back, and support creators using the Mirror platform.\n\n**Season One Media Committee Objectives**\n\n- Develop mCLUB logo, design assets, design guidelines, and social media processes approved by members\n- Establish presence on major platforms (Twitter, Mirror)\n- Develop content that supports mCLUB’s mission\n- Collaborate with community and governance committees to publish at least 2 articles on Mirror\n\n# Governance Committee\n\nThe governance committee’s primary responsibility is to help the DAO operate smoothly and efficiently so that the DAO can maximize its impact on the Mirror creator ecosystem.\n\n**Season One Governance Committee Objectives**\n\n- Establish and document a clear voting process and evaluation criteria for votes to be conducted\n- Create internal documentation for governance processes\n- Propose a budget to support creators for Season One\n- Conduct regular reviews of treasury allocation and make adjustments to operations, including adding to the treasury\n\n# Governance Process\n\n**Decisions requiring allocation of funds from treasury**\n\nFor any decisions that require an allocation of funds from the treasury, committees should follow the following process:\n\n1. Provide a summary of the decision to be made and options available (including a link to the proposal document)\n2. Establish a timeframe for discussion to take place on Discord, ensuring that all opposing viewpoints are discussed and suggested edits are made\n3. Do a “temperature check” using polling features in Discord\n4. Put the decision up for voting using Snapshot\n\n**Decisions that do not require allocation of funds**\n\nFor decisions that do not require allocation of funds from the treasury (e.g., Twitter handle to reserve for mCLUB), committees should follow the following process:\n\n1. Provide a brief summary of the decision to be made and options available\n2. Put the decision up for vote using polling features in Discord\n\n# Further Reading\n\n[mCLUB Media Charter](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IV-jfB_t2nXHgsWMzUBcl--z4saz-ZryKsPvZiUwKOc/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n[mCLUB Governance Charter](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1S31QFWS-6Q6pPrtKp1pxBdORwnqfkid18zHeL_uDtro/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n[mCLUB Governance Process (Season 1)](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uQtS4PVGG7TFvrL9-O6yWaMEA37dOyDBkWG1N7QtDQI/edit)\n\n[mCLUB Community Charter](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Cn3rlcKcuJA6C_Zl0-phHsSqnDF38lh2kVC8kTmHrDg/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n[mCLUB Project Backing Proposal Template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18V8NN_qPMST0XWcCYncz2JnENKe9JqXs_kAajySoUAg/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n# The Decision\n\nYes - Vote Yes to Confirm and Execute mCLUB S01\n\nNo - Vote No to not Confirm and Execute mCLUB S01",
