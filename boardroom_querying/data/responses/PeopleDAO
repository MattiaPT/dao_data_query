In an effort to tackle this role exhaustion and improve overall effectivity, a reduced term is proposed. This is in line with the general sentiment expressed in previous proposals, which did not reach the required participation quorum. Additionally, performance of individual governors and the whole team will be closely monitored with an objective of further improvements in the future.\n\nChange confirmation threshold and governor team to 4/6 configuration\nA smaller team will enable a closer cooperation and faster execution of the multisig, supporting the issue of degraded performance mentioned in the previous point. Given the value of PeopleDAO’s treasury, the current configuration is to be considered oversized. This updated configuration provides a similar level of security as the current setup.\n\nChange role reward to 50 USD in PEOPLE equivalent\nDuring the current governor team’s term, the reward of 1000 PEOPLE per month equaled to roughly 8 to 31 USD, depending on the token market price. Reward definition in USD with payouts in PEOPLE token equivalent at the moment of accounting counters the aspects of the token volatility, and provides a fair reward for the duties performed in the multisig governor role. Assuming the update of the governor team size, this will not have a significant effect on the total expenses dedicated to the management of the DAO’s multisig.\n\nVoting choices:\n- YES, approve the changes\n-  NO, deny the changes",

We would like to review learnings from other DAOs - one of these is MoonDAO’s transition from guild-based structure to project-based structure ([reference](https://twitter.com/LarrotizPablo/status/1638671447739760641)), which has also been adopted by other DAOs.\n\nDuring the first year of PeopleDAO’s existence, many different activities across the DAO and incubator/accelerator have been supported, however the organization has struggled to measure its impact and to provide significant return of investments. Moving forward, we believe that with the limited remaining resources, the DAO should focus on these two objectives, and the project-based structure greatly compliments this desire.\n\n### Areas of improvement\n\n#### Team composition\n\n- Before:\n  - Teams often consisting of large amount of low-context people with different levels of engagement and commitment for tasks\n  - Lack of strong entry criteria to join a team\n- After:\n  - Small teams built specifically for the given task\n  - Proven track-record and objective focus as requirement for joining a team\n\n#### Task definition and evaluation\n\n- Before:\n  - Tasks defined during seasonal planning with minimal focus on evaluation and implementation of key performance indicators\n  - Seasonal planning could result in evaluation loop being too long and ineffective\n  - Unknown impact of individual tasks and teams on the growth and return of investments for the DAO\n- After:\n  - Tasks defined with objectively measurable objectives as a requirement\n  - Task completion followed by evaluation as a condition for acceptance of other related tasks\n  - Evaluation loop shortened directly to the duration of the specific task\n  - Direct measurability of impact on DAO’s investments and growth\n\n#### Personal member progression\n\n- Before:\n  - Sometimes slow personal progression inside individual teams\n  - No defined procedures for rotation of team’s leadership\n  - Lack of personal performance tracking in the DAO\n- After:\n  - Ability to join different teams at various different positions in shorter period of time\n  - Opportunity for more inexperienced members to join low-impact/low-risk tasks as project leaders\n  - Tracking of personal performance based on evaluation of individual tasks\n\n### Implementation\n\n- The Operations Team will remain the only general-purpose team in the DAO\n  - The team is responsible for DAO's upkeeping and governance-related activities, such as accounting, elections and similar\n  - Membership in the team is subject to approval by DAO administrators and is evaluated on case by case basis according to the DAO's needs\n- A community member or group of members can become a self-assigned project lead by defining a project\n  - Projects are required to provide a clearly defined objectives and tasks, which have measurable indicators of completion, both in the personal and DAO-wide context\n  - Projects are required to provide a detailed breakdown of requested funds, including all spending items and member rewards\n  - Projects are required to seek and produce revenue-generating outcomes\n  - Project leads are required to assemble the project team from active contributors with proven track record in relevant area in order to maximalize the possibility of successful completion of the project\n  - All of above is a requirement for project proposal submission\n- DAO administrators are responsible for approving or denying project proposals\n  - Administrators are obliged to evaluate only proposals which have provided all required information (see above)\n  - Administrators are allowed to approve only proposals which produce revenue or other clearly defined means of positive return on investment for the DAO\n\n## Voting choices\n\n1. YES - Approve the proposal\n2. NO - Deny the proposal\n",

      "content": "PIP43: Phoenix Plan (pt. 1)  \nAuthor: MatterTurbulent#5161  \nReviewer, submitter: Prye#4845  \nRequired Quorum: 100M $PEOPLE (if not reached, the proposal will need to exceed 90% of the votes to pass)  \nVote Duration: 5 days\n\n## Description\n\nOn March 6 an exploiter drained 76ETH from the PeopleDAO treasury, constituting approximately 95% of the reserve funds. This plan articulates the changes the DAO should make in order to survive and continue operations, including:\n\n- Consolidation of remaining capital into the treasury\n- Increased alignment towards revenue-generating activities\n- Further austerity measures\n- Restructuring of teams, streamlining operations\n- Redefining treasury management processes\n\n#### Consolidation of remaining assets\n\nAs of March 7th, the PeopleDAO treasury holds approximately $4.3k USD worth of various tokens (not including the $SAFE token which is currently locked up). The DAO should conduct the following actions to consolidate its remaining assets:\n\n1. Transfer treasury funds on other chains (Binance and Polygon) to Ethereum, approximately $5k USD\n2. Refund the UnumDAO donation, approximately $12.4k USD\n3. Seek to claim the remaining funds in PandaDAO treasury, approximately 14.3k USD\n4. Merge LanguageDAO treasury with PeopleDAO treasury, pending LanguageDAO's approval, approximately $1.3k USD\n\nSumming all the potential assets, in the best case scenario, the treasury will reach $33k USD. By the end of 2023, the $SAFE token might become transferable, possibly unlocking another $10k-50k USD.\n\n#### Increased alignment towards revenue-generating activities\n\nThe DAO is poised to launch two NFT collections, Afro Piece and For The People, each of which represent revenue generating opportunities. Another Accelerator project, Perpex, could generate substantial revenue upon fundraising, estimated to occur in late-Spring/early-Summer.\n\nThe DAO should enter an emergency operation mode, focusing teams and contributions towards launching these projects, and suspending non-related non-essential activities, namely:\n\n- Suspend onboarding activities\n- Conduct Accelerator-related AMAs rather than general DAO AMAs\n- Research and consider adopting other operational models, e.g. project-based structure\n- Implement KPI and other indicators to evaluate the impact of individual DAO activities\n\n#### Further austerity measures\n\nDuring the budgeting for Season 4 the DAO began implementing austerity measures in response to forecasts about limited runway. Teams budgeted for fewer and lesser rewards. The DAO should increase these austerity measures. The DAO should return to a centralized budgetary process rather than on a team-by-team basis, to ensure greater checks around spending.\n\nCore Team will coordinate with Team leads to ensure March rewards from the beginning of the month get paid out, but contributors should recognize that we don’t have the funds to issue the same output of rewards as months past.\n\n#### Overhaul of treasury management processes\n\nAn overhaul of the current accounting task aggregation, summary, and execution is required. A new systematic approach will be introduced to cover up DAO's current operational security loophole that resulted in the exploitation. As such, the following temporary implementation will be adhered:\n\n1. Centralised compilation of pending rewards into a CSV file on GitHub\n2. Validation of the data, export of the file from Github into Safe\n3. Multisig group meeting and validation of the transaction\n\nAdditionally, the DAO and multisig members will utilize extra support tools, such as browser extensions and decentralized applications, to gain further details and insights on all treasury changes. A private standard operating procedure will be defined and provided to all core members and multisig members to enforce standardized operations for all treasury management actions.\n\n## Voting choices\n\n1. YES - Approve the proposal\n2. NO - Deny the proposal",

We formalized this operation (and Team) within the DAO during July last year and our portfolio has grown to include six projects. We originally conceived our program as an incubator, supporting entrepreneurs in turning their ideas into reality. Yet, with each business quarter our program reflected on what’s working, what’s not, and prescribed adjustments:\nReport 1 – https://bit.ly/3YudbLH\nReport 2 – https://bit.ly/3k7YXBd\n\nAfter over 6 months of activity as an Incubator, the Team has decided to evolve into an Accelerator. The primary distinction is that we’ll now only accept projects who have existing prototypes, proof-of-concept, or the equivalent. There is a saying: one day in the real world is a year in crypto. We are a relatively small DAO and supporting projects from the ideation stage has proven too resource and time-intensive, limiting our ability to take on a bigger portfolio amidst rapidly emerging trends. We are excited for our new direction as an Accelerator and welcome developers and builders to leverage our seed funding, marketing reach, and in-house services. \n\nWe are holding this vote to officiate changing the Incubator Program into the Accelerator Program, and therefore change the Incubator Team into the Accelerating Team. \n\nShould the voters approve, we encourage the DAO to adopt a new organizational tagline: “Accelerating People,” representing our dedication to social impact, and honoring our namesake token. \n\nVote Yes to APPROVE the change from Incubator to Accelerator \nVote No to REJECT the change from Incubator to Accelerator\n\nPIP42：从孵化器到加速器的转变      \n作者: MatterTurbulent#5161\n要求的法定人数: 100M$PEOPLE（如果投票没有达到法定人数，提案需要超过90%的支持率才能通过).\n投票时间: 5天\n\n自成立以来，PeopleDAO已将自己定义为一个启动社会影响项目的平台。去年7月，我们在DAO中正式确定了这一业务（和团队），而我们的投资组合已经发展到包括 六个项目. 我们最初设想我们的项目是一个孵化器，支持企业家把他们的想法变成现实。然而，每一个商业季度，我们的项目都会反思哪些是有效的，哪些是无效的，并作出调整 (报告1,报告2).\n\n经过6个多月的孵化器活动，团队决定发展成为一个加速器。主要的区别是，我们现在只接受有现有原型的项目，概念验证，或类似的项目。有句话说：现实世界的一天就是加密货币的一年。我们是一个相对较小的DAO，事实证明，从构思阶段就开始支持项目，资源和时间都很密集，限制了我们在迅速出现的趋势中承担更大的投资组合的能力. 我们对我们作为加速器的新方向感到兴奋，并欢迎开发者和建设者利用我们的种子资金, 营销范围和内部服务.\n\n我们举行这次投票是为了主持将孵化器项目改为加速器项目，从而将孵化器团队改为加速器团队. \n\n如果选民批准，我们鼓励DAO采用一个新的组织标语。\"加速 People\"，代表我们对社会影响的贡献，并纪念我们的同名代币. \n\n赞成将 \"孵化器 \"改为 \"加速器\".\n否决将 \"孵化器 \"改为 \"加速器\".\n",

The contracts will outline the duties, responsibilities and other matters incidental to the Perpex project. \n\nPeopleDAO Constitution Amendment: The Legal Team will continue the amendment process in Season 4, seeking to complete the formalization of the Accounting, Incubator, and Operations teams. We will gather public input from team leads and other contributors in the DAO, so the amendment addresses all interests. Our Constitution should remain a source of stability with clear policies. The team will also work with the Developer Team to ensure that the constitution is accessible to everyone on the website and other PeopleDAO directories. \n\nCommunity Well-being/Survey Analysis\nSurvey Analysis: The results of the survey conducted are out and ready. The Legal Team and the ops team will analyse the results and then lead efforts to communicate the results and recommendations to the DAO. \nCommunity Well-being: As a build-up from the Conflict Mediation Workshop that was helpful last year, I would like to propose another workshop for the DAO. The workshop will discuss Team Building, Team Communication and Emotional Intelligence as contributors in DAOs and the Web3 space: \nTeam Building: The number of people working in teams is rising, yet many are not as effective as they should be. Team performance, group cohesiveness, collective efficacy, and team member satisfaction improve when team building is optimal.\n Team Communication: Teams must communicate. Without workplace communication skills, contributors will make more mistakes and perform worse. Communication training lets contributors see how others see their ideas and accept constructive criticism.\n Emotional Intelligence:  Emotional intelligence is a solid indicator of workplace success, even if you are highly educated or excel within your workplace roles. Even if you're highly educated or skilled, emotional intelligence predicts job success.

El taller tratará sobre la creación de equipos, la comunicación en equipo y la inteligencia emocional como factores que contribuyen a las DAO y al espacio Web3: \nCreación de equipos: El número de personas que trabajan en equipo va en aumento, pero muchos no son tan eficaces como deberían. El rendimiento del equipo, la cohesión del grupo, la eficacia colectiva y la satisfacción de los miembros del equipo mejoran cuando la creación de equipos es óptima.\n Comunicación en equipo: Los equipos deben comunicarse. Sin habilidades de comunicación en el lugar de trabajo, los colaboradores cometerán más errores y rendirán peor. La formación en comunicación permite a los colaboradores ver cómo ven los demás sus ideas y aceptar críticas constructivas.\n Inteligencia emocional:  La inteligencia emocional es un indicador sólido del éxito en el lugar de trabajo, incluso si tienes una educación superior o destacas en tu puesto de trabajo. La inteligencia emocional es un sólido indicador del éxito laboral, incluso si se tiene un alto nivel educativo o se destaca en las funciones del puesto de trabajo. La formación en inteligencia emocional puede ayudar e impulsar al éxito a colaboradores individuales, equipos/grupos de trabajo y a la DAO en general.\n\nAsistencia al equipo de la incubadora: 8000 $ PERSONAS (Afropiece) + 5000 $ PERSONAS (Perpex) \nBienestar de la comunidad: 7000 $PEOPLE para el taller\nEnmienda de la Constitución de PeopleDAO: 6500 $ PERSONAS (fondos sobrantes de los fondos discrecionales de la 3ª temporada) \nAnálisis de la encuesta: 3500 $ PERSONAS (fondos procedentes de los fondos discrecionales de la 3ª temporada). \n\nN.B: Según el informe contable realizado a principios de mes, el equipo jurídico se quedó con un total de 30.000 $PEOPLE como fondos sobrantes de las temporadas anteriores. \n\nTotal: 20.000 $PEOPLE del DAO + 10.000 $PEOPLE (fondos sobrantes de la Temporada 3) \nAl equipo legal aún le quedarán 20.000 $PEOPLE para fondos discrecionales que siguen formando parte de los fondos remanentes de la temporada anterior. \n\n\nCHINESE TRANSLATION\n'PIP39：法律团队第四季预算提案\n核心提案\n作者：Chidi#5925\n要求的法定人数：100M$PEOPLE（如果投票没有达到法定人数，提案需要90%的批准才能通过）。\n投票时间。5天\n本季所需预算：50,000$PEOPLE\n\n法律团队为PeopleDAO第四季设定了以下目标。\n协助孵化器团队的工作：第四季的法律团队将开始为孵化器团队执行和最终孵化的一些项目提供建议。\n本季度，法律团队将与非洲片合作开展他们的NFT项目，以确保适当的许可和有关知识产权事项的建议，并确保这些权利得到保护。\n法律团队还将与 Perpex 项目，为团队成员和测试人员起草合同。这些合同将概述职责、责任和其他附带事项Perpex 项目\n\nPeopleDAO宪法修正案。 法律团队将在第四季继续进行修正工作，寻求完成会计、孵化器和运营团队的正式化。我们将从团队领导和DAO中的其他贡献者那里收集公众意见，以便修正案能够满足所有的利益。我们的宪法应该保持稳定的来源，有明确的政策。该团队还将与开发者团队合作，确保宪法在网站和其他PeopleDAO目录中可供所有人查阅。 \n\n社区福祉/调查分析\n调查分析： 所进行的调查的结果已经出来并准备好了。法律团队和运营团队将分析结果，然后牵头向DAO传达结果和建议。\n社区福祉：作为去年冲突调解研讨会的积累，我想为DAO提出另一个研讨会。该研讨会将讨论团队建设、团队沟通和情商，作为DAO和Web3空间的贡献者。\n团队建设：在团队中工作的人数在不断增加，但许多人的效率却不尽如人意。当团队建设达到最佳状态时，团队表现、团体凝聚力、集体效能和团队成员的满意度都会提高。\n 团队沟通：团队必须沟通。没有工作场所的沟通技巧，贡献者会犯更多的错误，表现更差。沟通培训让贡献者看到其他人如何看待他们的想法，并接受建设性的批评。\n 情商：情商是职场成功的可靠指标，即使你受过高等教育或在职场角色中表现出色。即使你有很高的教育水平或技能，情商也能预测工作的成功。情商培训可以帮助和推动个人贡献者、团队/工作小组和整个DAO走向成功。\n\n协助孵化器团队的工作：8000 $PEOPLE（Afropiece）+5000$PEOPLE（Perpex）。\n社区福祉: 7000 $PEOPLE 研讨会\nPeopleDAO 宪法修正案：6500 $PEOPLE (第三季可支配资金的剩余资金)\n调查分析： 3500 $PEOPLE (资金来自第三季可支配资金的剩余部分。）\n\n注：从本月早些时候完成的会计报告来看，法律小组总共剩下了30,000 $PEOPLE 作为前几季的剩余资金。\n\n共计： 20,000 $PEOPLE 来自 DAO + 10,000 $PEOPLE (第三季的结转资金)\n法律团队仍将剩下20,000 $PEOPLE 为可自由支配的资金，这些资金仍属于上一季度的滚存资金。\n\n\n\n\n",

      "title": "PIP38: Writer Team Season 4 Budget Proposal",
      "content": "# PIP38: Writer Team Season 4 Budget Proposal\n## Core proposal\nAuthor: Faevy#6563\nReviewer: Tet#7609\nRequired Quorum: 100M $PEOPLE (if not exceeds the Quorum, the proposal will need to exceeds 90% of the votes to pass)\nVote Duration: 5 days\n\nTotal budget estimate: 165,000 $PEOPLE\nBudget rollover from season 3: 138,000 $PEOPLE\n*Budget request for season 4: 27,000 $PEOPLE*\n\nIn the last season, the Writer Team started using a method called \"competitive writing.\" It has been using this method through Dework to assign tasks to its contributors. It's been a success so far, as we’ve had a lot of participation. The team has since adopted the use of Dynobot to welcome anonymous topic suggestions, after which suitable topics are chosen after a round of review. In season 3, we recorded a total of 15 article submissions via Dework; although this is below the estimated output amount, we encountered issues with repetitive topic suggestions by the writers. This made it hard to meet the original goal of publishing eight articles each month. \n\nHowever, in December, the writing tasks were moved to January (season 4) as a result of a delay in topic suggestions, which by extension delayed the selection process. In an effort to receive quality work over quantity, the writers were given the usual deadline of 3 weeks to complete their articles, which caused the extension into season 4. Therefore, the team did not make use of funds allocated for the month of December as there were no activities.\n\nMoreso, contributors whose articles were not selected after submission were compensated with a token, while the selected ones were either merged or approved individually. We encourage contributors and team leads to utilize some of the DAO tools that were needed, just as the Legal Team worked on using OpenLaw and Kleros DAO tools as suggested by the Writer Team in season 3.\n\nThis season, the Writer Team will continue its use of Dynobot for topic suggestions and its competitive writing system to select the best articles. The team will also include a template design for both previous and future topics to ensure everyone takes note of the finished articles. For the PeopleDAO website, we hope to produce an abstract summary for each finished article that has been produced thus far.\n\nAs a result, the Writer Team would like to propose the following budget for its season 4 activities, from January 1, 2023, to March 31, 2023: The upper limit of the budget sits at 165,000 $PEOPLE tokens this season. However, the Writer Team will operate in an efficient manner to conserve expenses. With a leftover estimate of 138,000 $PEOPLE tokens from season 3, the Writer Team would like to roll over these leftovers into its season 4 budget and request an additional 27,000 $PEOPLE tokens, thereby meeting its estimated budget expense of 165,000 $PEOPLE tokens for its season 4 activities.\n\nA clear breakdown of the Writer Team’s season 4 activities can be viewed in table below.\n\n ![Screenshot 2023-01-30 at 9.39.41 AM.png](ipfs://bafkreid55dikv3nafex3gzgm7vc6reapb3alv5eljwfd5aow43sptuzsrq)\n    \n",

This allowed for more effective task handling and delegation. Throughout the season, the team focused on the completion of the DAO’s website through the help of the Dev Team. Relevant website pages such as the Team Profiles and Incubated Project Profiles were added to showcase more information about the DAO. Social media posts that were released were monitored to ensure that they follow the established brand guidelines.\n\nNow that the Design Team has fairly made consistent imagery through our rebranding, hence, our main goal for this season – to continue to prepare for and produce quality design needs that may arise during the season. This includes the creation of content-filled social media releases such as twitter posts that are relevant, necessary, timely, and are grounded on the DAO’s core values and objectives.\n\nRecognition of meaningful DAO contributors will be continued through the current POAP reward system, not only by personally awarding the POAPs to the nominees, but also through the release of a publicity material to foster and encourage the People to significant participation. Likewise, quality POAPs will be provided for PeopleDAO event attendees. Discretionary funds will only be allotted for necessary design needs that may arise, otherwise specifically indicated and identified prior to the start of the season.\n\nWith these, the PeopleDAO Design Team proposes this budget for Season 4.\nThank you, and Long Live PeopleDAO!\n\nBudget: 77,500 $PEOPLE Tokens\nMore detailed budget here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wkg-Yw7ntTZrwlKaCR6LnCO7_8iVDiwg3zNMK0zs9js/edit?usp=sharing\n",

The project seeks additional funding to complete its product development. Perpex is currently in alpha testing with a closed group of traders. If PeopleDAO votes to approve additional funding then the DAO will receive a greater share of Perpex governance tokens and fundraising share once the protocol decentralizes. \n\n###### Project Updates\n\nPeopleDAO gave Perpex initial seed funding of 200K $PEOPLE back in June. The development team created a working alpha version of the exchange. \n\n![Screenshot 2023-01-25 at 22.16.18.png](ipfs://bafkreigeb45plfjnqjy2ebvswmcj5mw3mwrkciwqcylq2opoc4rcbbuhqy)\n    \n\nProduct testers can do actions like: \n- Monitor prices\n- Place multiple limit orders simultaneously\n- Go long or short\n- Customize their trading dashboard\n- Generally experience the user interface\n\nLooking forward, we’re putting further energy into the UX/UI to make a product that’s customizable and feels familiar to traders from multiple backgrounds. We’re building out the margin system. Lastly, we are integrating the regenerative mechanisms, routing trading fees to fund public goods and more. \n\n###### Requesting Additional Funding \n\nPerpex and the Incubator program are seeking an additional 200K $PEOPLE to complete the development of the application, and move to a more open beta testing. The 200K $PEOPLE will be used for the following purposes:\n\nHardware cost = 100K $PEOPLE\nOn-going front and back-end development = 100K $PEOPLE\n\n###### Revised Roadmap\n\nThe original roadmap projected completion of the application in Q3 2022 and governance decentralization in Q4. Development has taken longer than expected, and the Constitution auction this Fall reduced the bandwidth of PeopleDAO staff. The new roadmap:\n\nComplete Alpha Development - February 28\nPublic Beta Opens - March 1\nFundraising Starts on Juicebox - April 1\n\n###### Investment Terms\n\nUnder the original seed funding terms, Perpex would give PeopleDAO 5% of the forthcoming governance token and 5% of the ETH accrued during the fundraise. Should the PeopleDAO community approve this second batch of seed funding then the new terms will be changed to 6.5% of the Perpex governance token and 6.5% of ETH raised. \n\n###### Vote YES to approve the 2nd investment\n###### Vote NO to reject this proposal \n",

We continue to reflect and iterate on our program, looking for efficiencies and how to increase our development output.\n\nWe have the following goals for this quarter:\n\n1) Publish details about version 3 of the incubator program. The team has already conducted the evaluation and written the report. We’re finalizing the design. \n\n2) We expect all our projects to launch by the end of this season, or in the beginning of the next. Each integrates the $PEOPLE token, providing the token utility. We are excited to finish up testing and development with our product teams, and contribute advising and reach to their marketing. Our budget will support incubator stewards and use discretionary funds to cushion any unexpected project costs.  \n\nWe are requesting to roll over funds from last season (93,000 $PEOPLE) to staff project managers and support planning with discretionary funds. Our team asks for an additional 27,000 $PEOPLE.

As we say goodbye to the current Governor lineup who have served the DAO since the inception of the Treasury, we would like to welcome the new soon-to-be Governors lineup in this final round of Multisig Election. \n\nWe are going to elect 9 (NINE) Multisig Governors *de novo* in this final round from our pool of 15 self-nominated candidates who have been chosen by the community in our preliminary round of voting on our community Discord server. \n\nThe criterions are as such:\n\n1. A multisig Governor shall be able to comprehend and use the basic functions in the Safe (formerly Gnosis Safe) to sign and approve transactions.\n\n2. A multisig Governor shall be able to dedicate reasonable amount of time to fulfill the duties and responsibilities of the role, these mainly include: participate in necessary meetings, verify and sign transactions based on democratic resolutions of People DAO. \n\n3. A multisig Governor shall exercise due diligence to safeguard his/her own key through any reasonable means. Although the multisig is designed to protect assets even in case of compromises on parts of the signers, each Governor still need to act responsibly.\n\n4. Outside Candidates (those not originally from the PeopleDAO) who are $PEOPLE token holders are welcomed, provided they act in good faith and are able to fulfill the above mentioned requirements.\n\n5. The service term for our multisig Governor will be determined by a community vote on Snapshot in the upcoming PeopleDAO Improvement Proposal 33 (ie. PIP33). \n\n6. Monthly remuneration of the multisig Governors will be determined by the Operations Team (Ops Team) of PeopleDAO in their seasonal budget proposals. The Governors will be rewarded a minimum of 1,000 $PEOPLE tokens per month, subject to increment depending on the Ops Team's budget allowance and needs.\n\nDetails on our 15 candidates can be found in the following link. Top 9 voted candidates will be our multisig Governor.\n\n[Candidate info and rules of the election.](https://peopledao.mirror.xyz/p98hOHWhd1YSBoom8e7twMIxenMygIZE4qyxG0dYFTY)\n\n---\n中文翻译\n\n# PeopleDAO 最后一轮的多签选举\n\n亲爱的$PEOPLE，\n\n自 2022 年 1 月 17 日我们首次正式成立社区财政部以来，PeopleDAO 在过去的一年里取得了长足的进步。当我们告别自财政部成立以来一直为 DAO 服务的现任总督阵容时，我们想欢迎新的即将成为最后一轮多签人选举的阵容。\n\n在最后一轮中，我们将从我们社区 Discord 服务器上的初步投票中选出的 15 名自荐候选人中选出 9 名多签人。\n\n多签人标准如下：\n\n1. 多签监管者应能够理解和使用 Safe（以前称为 Gnosis Safe）中的基本功能来签署和批准交易。\n\n2. 多签监管者应能够投入合理的时间来履行角色的职责和责任，这些主要包括：参加必要的会议，根据 PeopleDAO 的民主决议验证和签署交易。\n\n3. 多签监管者应尽职尽责地通过任何合理的方式保护他/她自己的密钥。 尽管多签名旨在保护资产，即使在部分签名者妥协的情况下，每个多签人仍然需要负责任地行事。\n\n4. 欢迎持有 $PEOPLE 代币的外部候选人（并非最初来自 PeopleDAO 的候选人），前提是他们诚信行事并能够满足上述要求。\n\n5. 我们多签人的服务期限将由社区在即将到来的 PeopleDAO 改进提案 33（ PIP33）中对 Snapshot 进行投票来确定。\n\n6. 多签理事的月薪将由 PeopleDAO 的运营团队（Ops Team）在其季节性预算提案中确定。 多签人每月将获得至少 1,000个 ¥PEOPLE 代币奖励，具体奖励金额取决于 Ops 团队的预算津贴和需求。\n\n有关我们 15 名候选人的详细信息，请访问以下链接。 前 9 名投票的候选人将是我们的多签人。\n\n[候选人信息和选举规则。](https://peopledao.mirror.xyz/p98hOHWhd1YSBoom8e7twMIxenMygIZE4qyxG0dYFTY)",

Namely, in cooperation with Design and Writer team, an updated and extended PeopleDAO website was developed and deployed. The website now features profile pages of individual teams and incubated projects and subDAOs. A support for integration of Mirror.xyz articles produced within the DAO is now also available. Last but not least, an informational/educational page dedicated to the $PEOPLE token, including its live stats and charts, is about to be published.\n\nIn Season 4, the Developer team would like to continue in further extending the website to provide more information both for newcoming and existing members. Extra to this, the team would like to support the effectivity of PeopleDAO’s governance by building management tools in case no other ecosystem solution is suitable for the DAO’s use case. The team would also like to keep extra funds for support of incubated projects and extra discretionary funds, which have been not spent in the last season and would be carried-over to Season 4.\n\nObjectives:\n\n1. Extend PeopleDAO’s website:\n   - Add dedicated DAO governance and structure page, describing the leader structure, management roles and duties, and multisig\n   - Add an activity module displaying ongoing activities such as Twitter Spaces, active Snapshot proposals or scheduled Discord events\n   - Add implementation supporting Chinese translation of the website content\n2. Maintain PeopleDAO’s files repository:\n   - Keep the GitHub files repository in sync with all published off-chain documents, such as previous accounting spreadsheets, budget proposals, marketing materials, templates and similar resources\n3. Support incubated projects:\n   - Create a support fund for the Incubator Team and its incubated projects, any desired support from the Development Team will be applied through this budget\n4.

      "title": "PIP30: Buy The Fucking Constitution: PeopleDAO’s Commitment Towards Our Fundraiser",
      "content": "Core Proposal\nAuthor: Tet#7609\n\nDear $PEOPLE, \n\nNovember 2021 was a landmark moment in web3 history, it was the start of ConstitutionDAO who rallied people across the global in an effort to buy the a private copy of the US Constitution that was up for auction by Sotheby’s. Although the effort ended in vain as we were outbid by Ken Griffin, a second chance has emerged for web3 to take another shot at buying a second copy of the US Constitution, hosted by Sorheby’s, again.\n\nPeopleDAO is one of the main organisers for this year’s auction fundraiser, working closely with our partners from JuiceboxDAO, the Aztec Network, and Nucleo. As one of the key organisers, we wish to spearhead the fundraising initiative by allocating $10,000 US Dollars towards the fundraiser pool in the name of the PeopleDAO Community. With this, the community will also hold a stake in the governance of the Constitution document, under the pretext that we win the auction. \n\nSimilar to the original ConstitutionDAO fundraiser via the Juicebox Protocol, donated funds can be refunded via the fundraiser smart contract if we were to fail in the bidding for the Constitution document. Therefore, we would like to inform the members of the community that fail safes are in place and these $10,000 donated funds will not be made redundant in the event of an auction bidding failure. \n\nWithout further ado, we would like to hear the voices of the community. Are you in support of us contributing $10,000 US Dollars to the fundraiser initiative to once again have a chance in bidding for the US Constitution hosted by Sotheby’s on 13th December 2022? Voice out your choice, vote now. \n\nChoice 1: Approve the fund contribution. \nChoice 2: Deny the fund contribution. \n\n\n\n2021 年 11 月是 Web3 历史上具有里程碑意义的时刻，这是 ConstitutionDAO 的开始，它在全球范围内召集人们努力购买即将由苏富比拍卖的美国宪法的私人副本。虽然我们的努力以 Ken Griffin 的出价而告终，但 Web3 仍然有机会再次尝试购买由苏富比主办的美国宪法的第二份副本。\n\n作为主要组织者之一，我们希望以PeopleDAO社区的名义向筹款池拨出10,000美元，作为筹款倡议的先锋。有了这个，社区也将在宪法文件的治理中占有一席之地，前提是我们赢得了拍卖。\n\n与通过 Juicebox 协议进行的原始 ConstitutionDAO 筹款活动类似，如果我们未能竞标宪法文件，捐赠的资金可以通过筹款活动的智能合约退还。因此，我们想告知社区成员，失败的安全险已就位，如果拍卖失败，这 10,000 美元的捐赠资金将不会失去。\n\n事不宜迟，我们想听听社区的声音。您是否支持我们向筹款活动捐赠 10,000 美元，以再次有机会竞标苏富比于 2022 年 12 月 13 日举办的美国宪法拍卖？为您的选择发声，现在投票吧。\n\n选择一：批准资金拨款。\n选择二：拒绝资金拨款。",

With the surge of great contribution ideas and article subjects to educate the public, the Writer Team presented the new competitive publishing model to prioritise quality above quantity. In the upcoming season 3 operations, we plan to enhance and improve this system. Consequently, the Team will concentrate on three primary publication categories: the original DAOTOOL101 series, the comprehensive educational web3 series, and the new $PEOPLe ecosystem series.\n\nThe original DAOTOOL101 series will continue, but will focus more on tooling that does not have a current instructional or official documentation. In the meantime, PeopleDAO should use the tools to qualify them for authoring and publication. The web3 series released in season 2 was a new educational series aimed at both web3 and web2 audiences. The objective of the web3 series was to report on the happenings in web3, break it down into non-technical language for the typical layperson to comprehend and consume, and thereby increase the accessibility of non-native web3 users and newcomers to the web3 environment. The newest introduced series is the $PEOPLE ecosystem series. This series will focus on providing content pertaining to PeopleDAO's core, including its seasonal goal, performance indicators, incubated projects, and subDAOs.\n\nThis season, the Writer Team will also be responsible for the ConstitutionDAO anniversary event being organised by PeopleDAO. ConstitutionDAO was a defining moment for web3 and the worldwide decentralised crowdfunding movement as a whole. Although the objective of buying a copy of the US Constitution document was not accomplished, the initiative's enthusiasm, coordination efforts, and significance are unmatched. For this anniversary event, the Writer Team will collaborate with the other Teams within the DAO to celebrate ConstitutionDAO's first anniversary.\n\nAs a result, the Writer Team would like to propose the following budget for its season 3 activities, from October 1, 2022 to December 31, 2022. The upper limit of the budget sits at 215,000 $PEOPLE token this season. However, the Team will operate in an efficient manner to conserve the expenses.\n\n![Screenshot 2022-10-24 at 11.14.33 PM.png](ipfs://bafkreihqlkkpqaq2ornhnfgqxb6cvb45xwkzo426onunealnwwxgfyvqsa)\n\nVoting choices:\n- Choice 1: Approve proposal.\n- Choice 2: Deny proposal.\n\n---\n\n中文翻译\n\n# PIP25:写作团队第三季预算提案\n## 核心提案\n作者： Tet#7609\n评论家：koala#4988\n所需法定人数：1亿$PEOPLE（如未超过法定人数，提案需超过90%票数方可通过）\n投票持续时间：5天\n\n总预算要求：215,000 $PEOPLE 代币\n\n在编剧团队第二季的活动中，社区参与度达到历史新高。随着大量贡献理念和文章主题涌向大众，作家团队提出了新的竞争性出版模式，将质量置于数量之上。在即将到来的第3季中，我们计划加强和改进这个系统。因此，该团队将专注于三个主要出版物类别：原始的DAOTOOL101系列，全面的web3教育系列和新$PEOPLE生态系统系列。\n\n最初的DAOTOOL101系列将继续，但将更多地关注没有当前教学或官方文档的工具。同时，PeopleDAO 应使用这些工具使其有资格进行创作和发布。第2季发布的web3系列是针对web3和web2受众的新教育系列。Web3系列的目的是报告web3中发生的事情，将其分解为非技术语言，供典型的外行人理解和使用，从而增加非本机web3用户和web3环境新手的可访问性。最新推出的系列是$PEOPLE生态系统系列。本系列将重点提供与PeopleDAO核心相关的内容，包括其季节性目标、绩效指标、孵化项目和子DAO。\n\n本季，作家团队还将负责由人民道组织举办的宪法DAO周年纪念活动。宪法DAO是web3和整个全球分散式众筹运动的决定性时刻。虽然购买美国宪法文件副本的目的没有实现，但该倡议的热情和协调努力，和重要性是无与伦比的。对于这个周年纪念活动，作家团队将与DAO内的其他团队合作，庆祝宪法DAO成立一周年。\n\n因此，写作团队希望为2022年10月1日至2022年12月31日的第3季活动提出以下预算。本赛季预算的上限为215000$PEOPLE代币。但是，该小组将以有效的方式运作，以节省开支。\n \n![Screenshot 2022-10-25 at 7.14.28 PM.png](ipfs://bafkreice6xjkhtazbdrizgdpiilcxfingd5dkv76rq3gw2oqw2jp4rdcoa)\n\n投票选择：\n- 选项 1：批准提案。\n- 选择2：拒绝提案。",

Having previously focused on developing uniform DAO iconography via social media design and website rebranding, as well as the creation of contributor POAPs, it has now achieved its aim of designing various areas of PeopleDAO that need a branded design identity.\n\nDuring Season 2, the Design Team focused on branding by producing and assembling the Brand Book, creating social media design templates for use by the DAO, and redesigning our website with the assistance of our Dev team. It was also responsible for POAP affairs, including the creation of POAP events, the maintenance of a positive connection with the official POAP team, and, most importantly, offering incentives and acknowledging the significant efforts of DAO members. The Design Team is expanding its horizons for Season 3 with the addition of new members and PeopleDAO anniversary design efforts.\n\nFor Season 3, the PeopleDAO Design Team will continue working on the website by adding new designs through the use of elements that were previously made in Season 2. Some of the new website pages envisioned to be accomplished include the (i) publishing module - lists all publications (e.g., articles, blog posts, etc.) produced by the DAO from sources like Mirror, Notion, and other platforms; (ii) project profiles - describes the purpose and mission of each incubation project, and provides information about each project’s team members, external links, and more; and (iii) token profile - display the history, properties, and statistics about the $PEOPLE token. Additionally, the crafting of infographics and other content-rich publicity and promotional materials will also be continued for.\n\nRegarding new jobs, the POAP Lead role has been promoted to Co-Lead; this role will include overseeing additional shared design activities with the Design Team Lead. This requires participation in Fireside chat sessions, POAP-related activities, and collaboration with the POAP Assistant. In addition, we are raising the Season 2 POAP Monitor post to the far more aggressive POAP Assistant position. They will work closely with the Co-Lead to manage POAP operations, including monitoring people who qualify for our new POAP award system and attending Fireside chat if none of the Leads are available.\n\nDue to the approaching PeopleDAO Anniversary, the Design Team has additionally allocated an expected budget breakdown for the event's design and promotional materials. This includes social media postings, POAPs, and additional money for discretionary distribution and monitoring. PeopleDAO Anniversary and general Design Team discretionary funding will only be granted for unanticipated but essential DAO design requirements.\n\n\nWith these, the PeopleDAO Design Team proposes this budget for Season 3.\nThank you, and Long Live PeopleDAO!\n\nMore detailed budget here: Design Team Budget - Season 3 \nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1A6di0vfETLtoshX_ee5RbwRg1j4SvAEi9fyUUdQwo4w/edit?usp=sharing\n\n![Screen Shot 2022-10-22 at 4.15.30 PM.png](ipfs://bafkreicmocrz7gxszrlvk3e6iltnroqrxme2q35cmoavp52thwgb5ezsbe)\n    ",

The PeopleDAO’s design team led this effort, and supported by Developer team’s suggestions and feedback, produced a unified visual identity for the organization. Naturally, as this DAO-wide redesign task took a significant portion of the season's duration, regular activities on the Developer team were frozen to not result in duplicate work.\n\nIn Season 3, the Developer team plans to carry over most of the goals from Season 2 and use unspent budget. You can see the previous proposal here: https://snapshot.org/#/people-dao.eth/proposal/0x06c2ecb898f280cf0aa3446ea6a536656b3d97bf2c72fea8bba2b3ec7bf9e882. As PeopleDAO's visual identity guidelines are published, the team can now focus on original goals. Furthermore, the team plans to open public bounties on the Dework platform, allowing developers to apply for individual tasks and goals.\n\nObjectives:\n\n1. Extend PeopleDAO’s website:\n   - Add new pages about the $PEOPLE token and its live stats and charts\n   - Add a collection of articles published across various platforms that the DAO uses\n   - Add profile pages for individual incubated projects and subDAOs,  introducing their purpose, team and similar important information\n   - Add a section with DAO’s partners, current and previous\n2. Maintain PeopleDAO’s files repository:\n   - Keep the GitHub files repository in sync with all published off-chain documents, such as previous accounting spreadsheets, budget proposals, marketing materials, templates and similar resources\n3. Support incubated projects:\n   - Dedicate discretionary funds to support the Incubator Team and its incubated projects, any desired support from the Development Team will be applied through this budget\n\nA link to our Season 3 budget breakdown can be accessed here:  \n[PDF document](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/People-DAO/files/main/governance/proposals/PIP23-attachment1.pdf)\n\nSummary:  \nThe developer team is asking for 78,000 $PEOPLE plus a carry-over of the unspent part budgeted from Season 2, 208,000 $PEOPLE.\n\nVoting choices:\n\n1.

Until now, the DAO has relied on a large number of talented contributors to withstand market fluctuations, and PeopleDAO has discovered its vision and mission as a metaDAO at the hub of the People Ecosystem, offering public goods for web3 natives. We propose the formation of PeopleDAO's eighth Team, the Operations (Ops) Team, charged with improving organizational efficiency and making the DAO more effective in reaching its key performance indicators.\n\nThe new Ops Team is essentially a rebranding effort that brings various operations under a single and formalized umbrella.The new Ops Team supplants the old General Expenditure proposal's tasks and rewards. The original idea for General Expenditures was introduced in PIP15:\nhttps://snapshot.org/#/people-dao.eth/proposal/0xbea02e91ae863df7d32a1faabfd7f3a06496abc8f350c21ecf794676a421a0c6. \n\nThe Ops Team Season 3 duties:\n\n1. Discord management and moderation; including bots, webhooks, and integrations.\n2. Dework platform management for bounties and task delegation.\n3. DAO information aggregation management on platforms such as Notion, bip.so and Sobol.\n4. Weekly meeting facilitator and note taker management.\n5. Multisignatory Governor, it’s election, and the treasury management\n6. Identifying educational resources about DAO tools to enhance management and contributor experience, and in rare occasions self-producing these resources. Researching mechanisms and tooling geared towards DAO management and enhancing contributor experience - the prerequisite being an existing documentation is not readily available for the general public.\n7. Ensuring the proper conduct and management of all contributors and their deserved reward, Core Contributor inclusive.\n\nThe Core Contributors will collectively act as leaders of the Ops Team. The Core Contributor, who is responsible for overseeing the Ops Team's operations, has no control over the Team and cannot influence its actions. They are tasked to ensure a seamless functioning for the Team's work and ensure fair play between all DAO contributors.\n\nSeason 3 Budget Proposal (Oct 1 to Dec 31)\n \n![Screenshot 2022-10-13 at 9.50.42 AM.png](ipfs://bafkreia5s2x46kzgrwx4vdrvicrkm5bm34y2evqslf3a7iasswyylmxcam)\n    \n\nDetailed budget breakdown: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VcSLX8arqvpOEP2G9UVkOnO_x7ShDxt4Mt2Bi3tdofc/edit?usp=sharing \n\n---\n\n中文翻译:\n\n一个组织只有通过卓越运营才能抓住非凡的机会。\n\nPIP22：正式建立和资助PeopleDAO运营团队\n核心提案\n作者：ifun#9490 & Tet#7609\n审核者：核心团队\n法定票数：一亿$PEOPLE代币（如果不满足最低法定代币，提案将需要超过 90% 的选票才能通过）\n投票时间：5天\n\n本季度所需预算：1,013,000个$PEOPLE代币\n\nPeopleDAO 自 2021年底在ConstitutionDAO团队拍卖宪法失败之后成立以来，已经走过了漫长的道路。到目前为止，PeopleDAO依靠大量有才华的贡献者抵挡住了市场波动，并且 PeopleDAO 已经确认了它要成为metaDAO的愿景和使命来为web3用户提供公共产品。我们建议成立 PeopleDAO的第八个团队，即运营 (Ops) 团队，来负责提高组织效率并帮助DAO更有效地达到其关键绩效指标。\n\n新的Ops团队负责品牌重塑工作，并负责各种运营事务。新的 Ops 团队将取代旧的General Expenditure的任务和奖励， 出事的General Expenditure理念是在 PIP15 中引入的：\nhttps://snapshot.org/#/people-dao.eth/proposal/0xbea02e91ae863df7d32a1faabfd7f3a06496abc8f350c21ecf794676a421a0c6。\n\n运营团队第3季职责：\n\n1. Discord的管理和运营，包括机器人、webhook和集成。\n2. Dework的平台管理和赏金任务委派\n3. Notion、bip.so、Sobol等平台上的DAO信息聚合管理\n4. 每周会议的主持人和记录员管理。\n5. 多签治理、选举和国库管理\n6. 寻找有关 DAO工具的科普资料来帮助管理者和贡献者提升运营DAO的经验，并在极少数情况下需要自己原创一些资料。当现有资料不容易提供给公众时，研究面向 DAO管理和增强贡献者体验的机制和工具。\n7. 确保所有贡献者的有正确的行为准则， 管理包括核心贡献者在内的贡献者应得的奖励。\n\n核心贡献者将共同担任 Ops 团队的领导者。 负责监督 Ops团队运营的核心贡献者无法控制团队，也无法影响其做出的决定。他们的任务是确保运营团队工作能无缝运作，并确保所有DAO贡献者之间的公平。\n\n第3季预算提案（10 月 1 日至 12 月 31 日） \n\n![Screenshot 2022-10-13 at 10.08.04 AM.png](ipfs://bafkreicyvw2nsxewn5yvbvzmamzxeb47hhbzy7ezuosjno3cbefdzgexmi)\n\n预算细节：\nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VcSLX8arqvpOEP2G9UVkOnO_x7ShDxt4Mt2Bi3tdofc/edit?usp=sharing \n    \n",

The Legal Team submits this updated version of the budget.) \n\nEvery DAO should have a subunit dedicated to improving governance and organisational policies. The major accomplishment of the Legal Team in Season 1 was to research and produce the PeopleDAO Constitution v1.0. The team set the following goals for PeopleDAO Season 2: \n\nAmend the Constitution -- Both our DAO and web3 are evolving at an accelerated rate. Our Constitution needs to keep pace with this growth. The Legal Team will lead an amendment process this season, beginning with public commentary and engaging topics such as improving governance and formalizing new teams. The Amendments will ensure our Constitution remains a source of stability with its set of clear policies. \n\nReport on DAO legal wrappers -- The regulatory environment around DAOs is shifting and new cases are being brought to court, which may have implications for DAOs and liability. Being unincorporated does not necessarily shield PeopleDAO from liability or taxation. The Legal Team commits to assembling a short report comparing different legal wrappers for DAOs, and drawing on expert opinion. \n\nConflict Mediation Workshops - Disputes, disagreements, and conflicts occur in all types of human relationships and coordination. Mediation can prevent conflicts and peacefully resolve disputes. The Legal Team plans on organising two virtual workshops that will pin-point the common sources of conflict and dispute in DAOs and also highlight the best ways to de-escalate and resolve these conflicts. POAPs will also be issued to the attendees after the completion of the workshops. \n\nThe Legal Team is asking for some discretionary funds in case any other pressing tasks appear, such as impromptu conflict mediation.\n\nThe Legal Team has assembled the following budget: \nAmendment Process = 20,000 $PEOPLE\nLegal Wrapper Report = 18,000 $PEOPLE\nConflict Mediation Workshops = 20,000 $PEOPLE\nDiscretionary Funding = 30,000 $PEOPLE \nTotal = 88,000 $PEOPLE\t\n\nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11H9JopS82nzZuKfplBczlrab0gvJKGTO34zaUI3u4cs/edit#gid=0\n\nVote “YES” to approve the Legal Team budget. \nVote \"NO\" to reject the Legal Team budget.\n",

This project is led by 0xAA, a core contributor skilled in smart contracts, and David, a PhD from Oxford with experience in blockchain technology, marketing, and computer engineering. \n\nVitalik Buterin articulated the use cases and benefits of non-transferable NFTs, called Soulbound Tokens (SBTs), in a January blog post. Aligned with this vision, Soulbound Protocol provides projects and users the ability to mint non-transferable NFTs for the following applications:\n- Soulbound proof of attendance NFTs\n- On-chain certificates\n- Sybil resistant airdrops (“SoulDrop”) \n- Governance (“Soul Gov”)\n\nThis project has an early-mover advantage and is among the first platforms putting SBTs into practice. The website is up and running as a demo product, giving Soulbound Protocol a head start on potential competitors: https://soulbound.life \n\nSoulbound Protocol requests funding in the amount of 200,000 $PEOPLE to help with product development and marketing. \n\nFunding will support development of a Plugin system for the distribution of Soulbound's Token Standard, ERC721S, and enable preparation for the Q3 2022 Mainnet launch.\n\nCold start funding will help the Soulbound team acquire the necessary hires to keep the team's progress on target with their goals for Q3 and Q4 of 2022.\n\n2022 Q3\n- Mainnet Launch\n- Plugin system for ERC721S distribution\n\n2022 Q4\n- Verification System \n- SoulDrop\n\nIn return for funding, this project offers membership NFTs to PeopleDAO and its subDAOs. Soulbound also commits to swapping at least 5% of its treasury to $PEOPLE.\n\nSoulbound offers further ROI in the form of providing PeopleDAO 2% of its governance token and 5% of funding raised (capped at 50 ETH). Lastly, Soulbound will allocate a small proportion of its governance token to individuals within PeopleDAO who contributed to Soulbound Protocol.\n\nThe detailed proposal can be found here:\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1AaARUeqWSAwI9IhhzY8FQuTJGUbtnuPOnWdB3BeLXag/\n",

This NFT project is a medium to showcase Africa’s art and history behind them, telling most of the forgotten stories and events that took place years ago. Our mission is to empower web3 revolution in Africa through spreading the beauty of its culture in the form of an NFT collection. The world can have a chance to explore the beautiful ancient art & African history. Therefore, this community project can possibly raise awareness for the continent as well as the PeopleDAO ecosystem. There are some cultural aspects that we can possibly design about such as the Argungu fishing festival.\n\nWe would like to request funding of 200,000 $PEOPLE (~$7,450 - $PEOPLE’s current price = $0.037). AFRO PIECE PeopleDAO will utilize this grant funding to complete deep research into the culture and history of Africa before the end of August, paying artists for designing, developing websites for NFT showcases as well as marketing and social media influencers. We plan to launch this NFT collection before the end of 2022. The detailed breakdown are as follow:\n\nResearch = 10,000 $PEOPLE\nConsultation = 20,000 $PEOPLE\nIRL Outreach to Museum and Art Galleries = 12,000 $PEOPLE\nDesign = 120,000 $PEOPLE\nMarketing = 38,000 $PEOPLE\nGrand total = 200,000 $PEOPLE\n\nRegarding the contribution to the ecosystem, 50% of total sales from the mint phase will be used to purchase $PEOPLE and then be delegated back to the PeopleDAO treasury. Moreover, the team decided to issue about 1,499 NFTs designed in the collection, in which 150 whitelist NFTs spots will be allocated for C-FRAC NFT owners and 200 general whitelist spots for people holding 1,500 people tokens. People in the whitelist spot are able to mint one NFT for half the sale price. Furthermore, we will also allocate about 10 free-minted NFTs for PeopleDAO core contributors and 20 NFTs for giveaway campaigns for the project marketing. The remaining 1,199 NFTs will be put on market sales. These incentives would encourage people to learn and hold $PEOPLE tokens if they want to purchase NFTs at a discount. Moreover, the project also aims to empower and bring more awareness to the PeopleDAO African community as well as the People DAO ecosystem. AFRO PIECE will be massively marketed on PeopleDAO Africa Twitter with the support from PeopleDAO marketing team.\n\nThe detailed proposal can be found here: \nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/14-8yi_dXyW0F55aw_tTnDzfd9G7W8dpZOVw47nJ-Bkg/edit?usp=sharing\n\nVoting choice:\nChoice 1: Yes, fund …\nChoice2: No, do not fund …\n",

The major accomplishment of the Legal Team in Season 1 was to research and produce the PeopleDAO Constitution v1.0. The team has set the following goals for PeopleDAO Season 2: \n\nAmend the Constitution -- Both our DAO and web3 are evolving at an accelerated rate. Our Constitution needs to keep pace with this growth. The Legal Team will lead an amendment process this season, beginning with public commentary and engaging topics such as improving governance and formalizing new teams. Amendments will ensure our Constitution remains a source of stability with its set of clear policies. \n\nReport on DAO legal wrappers -- The regulatory environment around DAOs is shifting and new cases are being brought to court, which may have implications for DAOs and liability. Being unincorporated does not necessarily shield PeopleDAO from liability or taxation. The Legal Team commits to assembling a short report comparing different legal wrappers for DAOs, drawn from expert opinion. \n\nConflict Mediation Workshops - Disputes, disagreements, and conflicts occur in all types of human relationships, across all dimensions and civilizations. Mediation is an important and fruitful strategy for the prevention of conflict and the peaceful resolution of disputes. The Legal Team plans on organizing two virtual workshops that will pin-point the common sources of conflict and dispute in DAOs and also highlight the best ways to de-escalate and resolve these conflicts. \n\nAdditionally, the Legal Team is asking for some discretionary funds in case any other pressing tasks appear, such as impromptu conflict mediation, or writing educational articles in collaboration with the Writer Team.\n\nThe Legal Team has assembled the following budget: \nAmendment Process = 20,000 PEOPLE\nLegal Wrapper Report = 15,000 PEOPLE\nConflict Mediation Workshops = 10,000 PEOPLE\nDiscretionary Funding = 20,000 PEOPLE\n\nTotal = 65,000\nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11H9JopS82nzZuKfplBczlrab0gvJKGTO34zaUI3u4cs/edit#gid=0 \n\nVote \"YES\" to approve the Legal Team budget for Season 2. \nVote \"NO\" and reject the Legal Team budget.\n",

      "content": "### Core proposal\nAuthor: Ran#2222, прыетранкаOG#4845\nReviewer: прыетранкаOG#4845\nRequired Quorum: 100M $PEOPLE (if not exceeds the Quorum, the proposal will need to exceeds 90% of the votes to pass)\nVote Duration: 5 days.\nRequired budget for the season: $330000 PEOPLE\n\nDeveloper is an important team in PeopleDAO, and every Season we have some goals to execute. A few of the more important goals\n\n1. Continuously update and iterate on our website to keep it up to date and active.\nTo this end, our key team member прыетранкаOG#4845 has been acting as an Owner of the Website, suggesting many directions for updates and optimizations. Let's look forward to the implementation and completion of these features together.\n\n2. Incubating SubDAO has been an important mission and revenue source for PeopleDAO. We have incubated many important SubDAOs, such as PandaDAO, LanguageDAO.\nThe Developer Team can provide important development capabilities for SubDAOs that are still in their initial stages. Development capability is the most needed capability in the beginning stage. In order to motivate the developers to contribute continuously and give them reasonable rewards, we also allocate a significant budget for the launch of SubDAO.\n\n3. DAO Info aggregator. In 2022 DAO governance model organizations are spurting out, and PeopleDAO is the inheritor of the DAO philosophy. we are considering aggregating important DAO information and making a website to bring together the DAO information you want.\n\n4. We have removed the budget allocation for the Active member of Coordinape. We believe that for Developers, \"Talk is cheap, show me the code\". We encourage people to contribute more and submit code.\n\n5. Discretionary funds only, for flexibility. (NOT ALL WILL BE USED) Other dev needs that arise that are not included in the tasks above will belong to this budget, such as devs assists for Incubation projects, data collection job, initial website creation, etc.\n\nA link to our season 2 budget breakdown can be accessed here:\nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HeY1c9D6K5lPbPAkYF5miWOHe2O18ebKdoE8uBVaYlk/edit?usp=sharing\n\n核心提案\n作者。Ran#2222, прыетранкаOG#4845,\n审核人。прыетранкаOG#4845\n要求的法定人数。1亿 $PEOPLE（如果没有超过法定数量，该提案将需要超过90%的票数才能通过）\n投票时间。5天。\n本赛季所需预算：$330000 PEOPLE\n\n开发者是PeopleDAO的一个重要团队，每个赛季我们都有一些目标要执行。下个季度几个比较重要的目标\n\n1. 不断地更新和迭代我们的网站，使其保持最新和活跃。\n为此，我们的主要团队成员прыетранкаOG#4845一直扮演着网站主人的角色，提出了许多更新和优化的方向。让我们一起期待着这些功能的实施和完成。\n\n2. 孵化SubDAO一直是PeopleDAO的一个重要任务和收入来源。我们已经孵化了许多重要的SubDAO，如PandaDAO，LanguageDAO。\n开发者团队可以为仍处于初始阶段的SubDAO提供重要的开发能力。开发能力是初始阶段最需要的能力。为了激励开发者不断做出贡献并给予他们合理的奖励，我们还为SubDAO的启动分配了大量预算。\n\n3. DAO信息聚合器。在2022年的DAO治理模式中，各种组织如雨后春笋般涌现，PeopleDAO是DAO理念的继承者。我们考虑将重要的DAO信息聚合起来，做一个网站，汇集大家想要的DAO信息。\n\n4. 我们取消了对Coordinape活跃成员的预算分配。我们认为，对于开发者来说，\"空谈误国，实干兴邦\"。我们鼓励大家多做贡献，提交代码。\n\n5. 用于自由支配的资金，以获得灵活性。(不会全部使用)其他不包括在上述任务中的开发需求将属于这个预算，例如孵化项目的开发协助，数据收集工作，初始网站创建等。\n\n我们第二季的预算明细的链接可以在这里找到。\nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HeY1c9D6K5lPbPAkYF5miWOHe2O18ebKdoE8uBVaYlk/edit?usp=sharing\n\n",

Part of the team’s duties is to address the ever-increasing demand for accounting and reward payout issues, and assist in enlightening members on the proper use of platforms used for payment. One of our successes in the just concluded Season 1 of PeopleDAO was ensuring that all the Teams in PeopleDAO which had accounting and Coordinape issues fixed and we look forward to continuing this in all the subsequent seasons. The Accounting team is also tasked with providing payout information and making the spreadsheet links available and accessible to everyone. This task also involves updating total $GIVE token allocated during each epoch in Coordinape into the spreadsheet.\n\nJust like accounting is absolutely needed in every organisation, it is also very vital in this space as well. Along with providing accounting help, the team will also facilitate and provide tutorials on how to use reward distribution platforms in web3 such as Coordinape, Dework and etc. The Accounting team will provide a weekly calendar that will include plans, meetings and tasks for each week. So we urge you to vote for the Accounting team budget proposal to officially make us a Team as this guarantees detailed and all-inclusive accounting. \n\nThe Accounting Team request a total of 198,000 $PEOPLE token in funding for its season 2 operations. \n\nA link to our season 2 budget breakdown can be accessed here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/181fNqfzJ3OGOpaj5InZTa1qk0-PFGRkmM4aKiVL56I4/edit#gid=0\n",

Previously having worked on select NFT projects for the DAO and creation and coordination of POAPs, it is now moving towards crafting different aspects of PeopleDAO that involve having an established branding design identity. \n\nDuring Season 1, the Design Team worked on the NFT projects “For the People” and Nicholas Cage PFPs. It also worked on POAP matters: creating art and POAP events, maintaining a good relationship with the official POAP team, and most importantly, providing incentive and recognizing the meaningful contributions of the individuals within the DAO. For Season 2, the Design Team is broadening its horizons with new design initiatives and publicity materials. \n\nFor Season 2, the PeopleDAO Design Team will work on having a solid branding identity for PeopleDAO. It will have its own brandbook, consistent social media templates, designs, and infographic releases. With these, the Design Team aims to increase awareness of PeopleDAO, strengthen our presence in social media, and brand us as a DAO that is credible and informational: providing insight on crypto, DeFi, and social goods. Additionally, the Design Team will also continue to reinforce positive and meaningful contributions through its POAP efforts, as it works on a new system of rewarding, and a need for a POAP Monitor. Since we also anticipate more design work in the season, following the introduction of Incubated Projects, we have also included a Discretionary Fund for this season. \n\nWith this, the PeopleDAO Design Team proposes this budget for Season 2.

The Team dedicates itself to address the ever-increasing demand for insightful and entertaining write-ups. In particular, during Season 1 of PeopleDAO, the majority of the Team’s effort focused on producing educational and informative articles that could assist web3 users in understanding the governance and management of decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs). This particular series was dubbed the DAOTOOL101 series and will continue onwards with its publication into Season 2 of PeopleDAO. The Writer Team is also responsible for inter-Teams coordination within PeopleDAO to copy, edit, and publish documents to forward PeopleDAO’s vision and mission.\n\nThe general purpose for this proposal is to rework the Season 2 budget proposal for the Writer Team, running from July 1st 2022 to September 30th 2022. In brief, the Writer Team will increase reward payout per article for each article written to both writers and editors. As such, the Writer Team will abandon the use of the Coordinape dApp and its 20,000 $PEOPLE reward pool allocation. Instead, this pool will be repurposed for discretionary expenses. Lastly, the Writer Team will establish the Research Club - a place to discuss and analyze the web3 ecosystem to produce better content for the people. \n\nIn order to achieve these goals, the Writer Team proposesthe following budget breakdown.\n\n![Screenshot 2022-06-26 at 12.47.17 AM.png](ipfs://QmXLge68tVieMVJLoLeCcRJT6pHQpuwshkPRe34tNyG2JL)\n    ",

      "title": "PIP9: SubDAO Incubation: Perpetual DAO - A SubDAO Governing the PEDEX DeFi Platform",
      "content": "Incubation proposal\nAuthor: Tet#7609\nReviewer: Incubation Committee\nRequired Quorum: 100M $PEOPLE (if not exceeds the Quorum, the proposal will need to exceeds 90% of the votes to pass)\nVote Duration: 5 days\n\nPerpetual Decentralized Exchange, PEDEX, is an up and coming DeFi platform that will be governed by the Perpetual DAO subDAO. This project is under the lead of Niffo, a forex and crypto trader, and developer. The project believes that blockchain technology can increase access to financial instruments, unlocking new economic opportunities for worldwide participants. The mission of PEDEX, and Perpetual DAO, is to open up a DeFi platform to everyone that facilitates the trading of perpetual futures. The key advantage of said platform will be its superior UX/UI design, as well as providing functionalities that many DeFi protocols lack in today’s markets. A brief feature description can be found below: \n\n- Placing bulk Limit orders through clicking on the order book \n- Pre-defined Take Profit, Stop Loss with Limit and Market orders \n- Multi-updating of Take Profit and Stop Loss orders \n- Trading directly from the order book \n- Adding widgets on the home screen and free moving \n- Managing multiple trade accounts by easy switching \n\nPerpetual DAO would like to request a funding amount of $7,500 USD in total to help its development. The PEDEX platform will utilize the bulk of the funding of $7,500 USD, in its blockchain-integrated development operation for a functioning demo dApp and website in Q3 2022. The cold start funding will help the PEDEX team to further the development of the platform and hire new blood focused on blockchain-integration tasks, as well as frontend development. The detailed breakdown are as follows:\n\n![Screenshot 2022-06-23 at 12.43.25 AM.png](ipfs://QmRYA7RSuKiPiCjjFbUouNFDgEAkGsUX5yABvJwDEW9qsx)\n\nPost-development in Q4 2022, the PEDEX platform and its governing subDAO, Perpetual DAO, will organize a seed round to accumulate additional funding when a functional dApp is produced. Said seed round funding will be conducted on Juicebox - where 5% of the funding $ETH and Perpetual DAO’s governance token will be delegated to the People DAO Treasury. In addition to this, Perpetual DAO will also set up a donation platform known as The Foundation, where all donation proceeds will be given to the People DAO Treasury to help incubate future projects. The donation for this foundation will come from 1% of all transaction fees revenue on the PEDEX platform, as well as altruistic donors from around the world. Lastly, a separate portion of the trading fees, valued at 1%, will be provided to People DAO in support of its development. \n\nThe distinction between these two streams of constant funding (i.e. from the Foundation, and from the trading fees) is to differentiate the charitable narrative, and the profit narrative. Donation from the Foundation is solely for incubation purpose, whereas returns derived from the trading fees is a return on investment for People DAO. The latter can be used for any financial purpose by the People DAO community, incubation inclusive.\n\nThe detailed proposal can be found here, together with a Chinese version: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pZs6CYrqET9Yg85illyQqo11GjWuyzOoDr7lCAY5oP4/edit?usp=sharing \n\nVoting choice:\nChoice 1: Yes, fund Perpetual DAO & PEDEX.\nChoice2: No, do not fund Perpetual DAO & PEDEX.\n",

      "title": "PIP6: Incubator Proposal for Docu-Series and Pilanthropic NFTs",
      "content": "PeopleDAO member Existential Zoomer is proposing a community project to raise awareness about human trafficking in Nigeria and bring direct aid to victims. The project consists of a video docu-series and philanthropic NFT collection, developed in collaboration with DAO members Matter Turbulent, 0xAA, and Y4000. We ask the PeopleDAO community to approve coldstart funding worth approximately $7700 USD to launch the project titled The Lost Children of Benin City. \n\nColdstart funding will support Existential Zoomer traveling to Benin City, conducting interviews and background research for the project, as well as producing some visual assets in the form of photographic and video content. As a deliverable, Zoomer will produce a multimedia article showcasing her research and building support for additional fundraising. The visual assets can inspire creative development of the NFT collection. \n\nIn terms of financial sustainability, the forthcoming NFT collection and video streaming fees will both act as forms of revenue. We plan to explore multiple funding sources to fund the broader docu-series, including Gitcoin, CultDAO, and PeopleDAO.   \n\nThis project would count as one of the first docu-series launched and financed by a DAO and web3 mechanisms. Using an NFT collection both as a fundraiser and a vehicle for philanthropy makes the effort even more innovative. \n\nHere is a message from Existential Zoomer about what the initiative means to her: “This project is dedicated to all the ones we’ve lost, the ones who will never be found and the untold stories, and to the ones we have found but who are scarred and will never be whole again.”  \n\nSnapshot Voting: \nVote YES to fund the coldstart of $7,700 USD and vote NO to reject the coldstart proposal.\n\nRead the whitepaper for more information about The Lost Children of Benin City: https://peopledao.mirror.xyz/EkTz2hKW8mIAIVgCZfc3mkJNJlvt68KbVye-QsWgQgQ ",

The expensive gas fee is too expensive on ETH mainnet, which hinders the massive adoption of people token. Community members want to bring people token to Ethereum Layer 2 solutions and other popular blockchains, such as BSC and Avalanche. The purpose of the proposal is to bring people token cross-chain.\nBenefits of cross-chain:\n1.\tLow gas-fee\n2.\tUsers from other chains can own people token\n3.\tDiversified ecosystem\nWe contacted with major cross-chain bridges projects：\n-\tMultichain (previously anyswap).\n-\tCeler network\n\nThey are glad to collaborate with us and both are very easy to use. The cross-chain bridges support multiple chains including Optimism, Boba network, Arbitrum, Polygon, BSC, Fantom, Avalanche, Fantom, MOVR, OEC, CRO, and more.\nIf people choose to cross chain, we will ask for partnership with Multichain (previously anyswap), Celer Network, Chainge Finance, and Wormhole Bridge.\n\nWe have 2 options to vote for:\nOption 1: Let's cross-chain.\nOption 2: Do not cross-chain.\n\nFor details of cross-chain bridges, please check:\nAnyswap Bridge: https://docs.multichain.org/how-it-works\nCeler Bridge: https://cbridge-docs.celer.network/\n\n\n\nChinese Version：\nPeople代币目前仅在以太坊上可用。 但是ETH 主网上的gas 费太贵了，这阻碍了人们去拥有People。 社区成员希望将People代币跨链到以太坊L2解决方案和其他流行的区块链，例如 BSC 和 Avalanche。 该提案的目的是使People代币跨链。\n跨链的好处：\n1. 低gas费\n2. 其他链的用户可以拥有people token\n3. 多样化的生态系统\n我们联系了最流行的跨链桥项目：\n-\tMultichain（以前是 anyswap）\n-\tCeler network\n他们很高兴与我们合作，两者都非常易于使用。 跨链桥支持多条链，包括：Optimism、Boba network、Arbitrum、Polygon、BSC、Fantom、Avalanche、Fantom、MOVR、OEC、CRO等。\n如果人们选择跨链，我们将与 Multichain（以前的 anyswap）、Celer Network、Chainge Finance 和 Wormhole Bridge 建立合作伙伴关系。\n\n两个投票选项\nOption 1: 跨链.\nOption 2: 不跨链.\n",

      "content": "Core Proposal PIP1 - Founding Voter POAP\n\nAuthors: MatterTurbulent#5161 and Steakr#8817\nProposal Synopsis: Gift a POAP to wallets who voted Yes to form People DAO in the PIP0\nRequired Quorum: 322.43m $PEOPLE (a majority of the amount that voted Yes to create People DAO)\nVote Duration: 5 days\n\nProposal Details: People DAO was officially established on December 6th when the PIP0 vote closed, with Yes garnering 99.8% of the vote. We propose all wallets who voted Yes should receive a POAP as a token of appreciation, and to commemorate the founding of People DAO.\n\nPOAP, which stands for Proof of Attendance Protocol, offers a record of life experiences. The protocol issues POAPs, which are non-fungible tokens tied to an image, similar in principle to an IRL badge or pin. They can be kept as mementos, used to access privileges or activities, or sold in secondary markets like OpenSea. \n\nPOAPs are issued on an Ethereum sidechain called xDAI. The costs are covered by the protocol, so minting is free to both issuers and users. POAPs can be migrated from xDAI to Ethereum mainnet but that does require paying gas fees. Learn more about POAPs here: https://poap.xyz/faqs\n\nPeople DAO contributor Steakr made a design for the Founding Voter POAP, in discussion with another DAO member, Matter. The design has received support from the community, as voiced on Twitter and the Discord. View the design here: https://twitter.com/The_PeopleDAO/status/1472640551350460418?s=20\n\nVote Yes to support the distribution of the Founding Voter POAP to eligible wallets. Vote No if you don't want People DAO to provide this POAP. \n",
