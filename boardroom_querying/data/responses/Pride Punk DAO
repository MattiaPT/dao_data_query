      "content": "This proposal is fairly straight forward.\n\nAs many of you already know, I'm wasnt.eth aka 🌺🌺🌺.eth in the PridePunks Discord. \n\nI'm seeking reimbursment for the $733.92 in ETH I spent to claim 142 Dao Vote tokens across all 71 ETH addy's. Sounds like a lot but when you spread your full collection out it really does add up!\nI mainly did this to protect the DAO if another sybil attacks occured. So far we've seen this scenario play out once before with Bloot Maxi's attempt at draining the Treasury for nefarious reasons. I'd like to not see this happen again, at the very least disuade any further attempts wiht more voting weight.\n\nJust a few thoughts on all this to whomever is reading this proposal:\n👉I have every intention to continue to claim vote tokens going forward. This does help disuade attackers.\n👉I would love to see more community engagement in bolstering the Vote Tokens as I have done the past 10 months. Its defintiely not ideal to have 1 representative(myself) with this much voting weight. Ideally this would all be spread amongst several individuals!\n👉This will help protect the Treasury and further the goals of our slice within the Historical NFT community. \n👉Maybe this proposal could be used for encouraging further delegations within our Dao. I'd be 100% in favor of anyone else willing to show proof of vote tokens/delegations to get reimbursed the few $'s in gas. This really could help out individuals who are struggling in this bear market who don't want to spend their hard earned ETH for a token. \n\nHere's a spreadsheet outlining all of my addy's with corresponding PridePunks, and vote tokens(tx's included) as well as $ figures on the day of the tx. At the very bottom of the Google spreadsheet is the sum of everything. \nGoogle Spreadsheet link: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pJtRigWZhhZNkPZy8HicGJ6iccYKp2gRBBZmlnH_Rus/edit?usp=sharing\n\n\nI would be very greateful if this passes. I do need this money for IRL things atm and it would encourage others to be more proactive within the Dao.\n\nThanks for reading!\n-🌺🌺🌺.eth",

The team has worked tirelessly to further the depth and breadth of our reach and I'd like to propose we show them this one off appreciation for the Holidays.\n\nSome criteria we based this off of included an average activity within our community and reaching projects that are being worked on. On average of 3 posts or more daily. And have been active the past few months. Just a few general rules of thumb that quite a lot of the community notices. We know who's active and who isnt!\n\nIn total 6 individuals would receive .2 ETH for a total of 1.2 ETH. These funds would come directly out of the marketing fund at the end.\n\nYou can find all contract and wallet addresses here: \nhttps://pridepunks.notion.site/Smart-Contracts-2022-in-progress-b04e5193ce8e4e538d0de3dc77586b1a\n\nIn essence this vote will auto trigger the treasury to send funds to the individuals listed below under 'actions'. This is to ensure its all done on chain and will not be done manually. Once and if this proposal passes, the marketing fund will send 1.2 ETH back to the treasury to replenish what was taken.\n\nThe 6 individuals that would receive: 🌺🌺🌺.eth, Liz, Bigfud, Dennision, CB and Clouds. Their addresses are listed below in actions.",

This is Non-salary marketing fixed costs.\n\nThis decision will transfer 8 ETH to the Marketing Team MultiSig\n\n3) Take 100% ownership of all future secondary market royalties with 15% being directed to the Marketing Team. \n\nThis decision will be implemented by Dennison Bertram off-chain with OpenSea and is a consensus decision. \n\n## Details for the Contributor Marketing Budget: \n\nThe Contributors are proposing a $15,500 USD pool allocation and 12 DAO PridePunks for marketing. This budget is intended as a soft launch with the intent on implementing high CAC marketing allocations.  These allocations will be tied to a Gnosis safe which will be transparent and require multiple signers for distributions.  \n\n## Marketing Gnosis safe:\n\n0xAfF8b9EAB9EB607583b90CFA9BCA0DB32A5C6280\n\n### Signers:\n\n1. Lizo (**Li𐌶⭕#7025)** - Leading Community participant 0x20E4e9B5ceF818804e410265b8366270967Ab622\n2. CitizenLev (**CitizenLev#7342)** - Tenured digital marketing expert 0x12F1835FdF7f45e1F4B77f0D2DA8D1963F11db59\n3. Nicholas.bit (**nicholas.bit#4746) -** Community Discord Co-founder 0xE754b9be1f5997F530f889cea3Fc7744cdF4D86b\n\n \nMarketing will target key demographics and share our mission attracting NFT membership advocates that resonate.\nAllocation uses may include:\n•    Landing page builder \n•    Branding images\n•    Video clips\n•    Photos\n•    Google Analytics\n•    Google Tag Manager\n•    Google Search Console\n•    Google Ads campaign \n•    Google Discover ads\n•    YouTube ads\n•    Twitter ads\n•    Merchandise\n•    Events\n•    Giveaways\n\nAdditionally, we are requesting that moving forward, 15% of aggregate revenue be set aside for marketing allocations to the marketing Gnosis safe for above items and advocate building programs. We are also proposing that merchandise sales allocations be directed to marketing Gnosis safe for restock and distribution.  This can be adjusted as the DAO deems necessary. We believe that our strategy will build our community and grow advocate holders who resonate with our mission. Additionally, we feel that our efforts will generate DAO sustainability for the foreseeable future.",

This proposal will reduce the proposal threshold to 1 (meaning you need only one vote token to make a proposal) and reduce the Vote Quorum to 10%. \n\nWe can revisit this in the future, if the quorum is too low, and not enough people pay attention, it will be possible to rug the DAO. However at the moment the greater probably is not having enough participation. \n\nImage Preview by Steve Johnson @Unsplash\nhttps://unsplash.com/photos/wpw8sHoBtSY\n\n",
